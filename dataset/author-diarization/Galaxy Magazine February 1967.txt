“We’re looking for people 
who want to write” 



By Gordon Carroll 

Director, Famous Writers School, Former 
editor, Reader’s Digest, Time, Inc., Coronet 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would like to test your writing aptitude. 
We’ll help you find out if you can be 
trained to become a successful writer. 

Several years ago, we started the 
Famous Writers School. Our aim was to 
help qualified people acquire the skills 
they need to break into print. We poured 
everything we knew about writing into 
a new kind of professional training 
course, which you take at home and in 
your free time. After a solid grounding 
in fundamentals, you get advanced train- 
ing in the specialty of your choice— Fic- 
tion, Non-Fiction, Advertising or Busi- 
ness Writing. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers or editors. 
Your instructor spends up to two hours 
analyzing your work. He blue-pencils 
corrections right on it — much as an 
editor does with established writers. 
Then he returns it to you with a long 
personal letter of advice and specific 
recommendations. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to more than 100 



publications including Reader's Digest, 
True, Redbook. 

Stephen Novak of Wayne, N. J., says, 

“I just received a check from Ellery 
Queen's Mystery Magazine. That’s 11 
stories sold in six months.” Doris Steb- 
bins of S. Coventry, Conn., who has sold 
six stories to Woman's Day for $2,050 
writes, “Taking your Course has made •* 
it all possible.” 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you can benefit from this 
training, send for the School’s Aptitude 
Test. If you test well, or offer other evi- 
dence of writing ability you may enroll. 
But there is no obligation to do so.

More About Being Bad 



A t the World Science Fiction 
Convention for 1966, hdd in 
Cleveland, Ohio, in September, 
the producers of a new science- 
fiction television show called 
Star Trek appeared, bearing 
pilot films, samples of costumes, 
a brace of writers and their own 
good selves. They were greeted 
with a great deal of enthusiasm 
from the fans and well they 
should have been, because a 
power of money had gone into 
some handsome sets, and a power 
of talent had been invested in 
preparing the scripts. On the 



strength of the sample displayed 
in Cleveland, and knowledge that 
sudh writers as Theodore Stur- 
geon, Robert Bloch, Harlan Elli- 
son and others were writing stor- 
ies for the show, the Cleveland 
Convention voted it a special 
plaque for excellence. 

Then the regular TV season 
rolled around, and the real Star 
Trek shows (not the pilots; TV 
people like to play a little game 
with pilots, which seldom if ever 
are truly representative of the 
real thing, so it was to be ex- 
pected that the actual prqduct

would be shoddier, cheaper and 
duller) hit the air, and . good 
heavens, what unorthodoxy! The 
regular shows were just as good 
as the pilots! It looked as though 
there were finally going to be a 
regular science-fiction series on 
television that we wouldn’t have 
to explain away as a cheap imi- 
tation of the real thing; some- 
thing some of us might turn to 
for enjoyment. 

Enjoy it while you can, fellows. 
As of yesterday the word was 
out: Star Trek will be off the 
air shortly after you read this. 
It just didn’t make it in the rat- 
ings. 

Once again the high priests of 
TV programming having saved 
us from the danger of viewing 
anything not instantly compre- 
hensible by a dull pre-schooler. 

The reason is the old familiar 
one: At the time-slot when Star 
Trek was presented for viewing, 
the other shows had a larger 
share of the audience. 

Now, it is a fact — not un- 
known to TV executives — that 
the way to build up your share 
of the audience is to appeal to 
the most immature and least well 
educated groups in the country, 
because there are more of them, 
Sfar Trek made the mistake of 
appealing to a comparatively 



literate group: that is, ten-year- 
olds would probably like it, but 
six-year-olds would not. 

Please understand us: Stat, 
Trek was a fun show, worth en- 
couraging, but not necessarily the 
best show ever produced. Science 
fiction is capable of far more 
challenge and drama than even 
Star Trek ever dreamed of using. 
We wouldn’t mind if it were be- 
ing cancelled for something bet- 
ter; but all experience indicates 
that there is at least a .9 prob- 
ability that it win be cancelled 
for something worse. 

And so the TV wise men have 
won another victory in their 
ceaseless battle to stamp out 
thought in the American mind. 

Unless, of course, there’s a last- 
minute reprieve. If enough peo- 
ple wrote letters to the National 
Broadcasting Company, or the 
local stations carrying Star Trek, 
or even to the sponsors, it mi^ht 
get them to give this promising 
show a chance to show what it 
can do. 

But they probably won’t. 
They’ve got other things on their 
minds — such as trying to fig- 
ure out why the biggest rating 
smash success in recent months 
was a ten -year-old movie.

He was dropped info Red China on 



a mission he didn't know — with 
his life a forfeit if he failed! 



I 

H unted by the F.B.I. as a con- 
victed mass murderer . and 
concealed by the Central Intel- 
ligence Agency for some damn- 
able purpose, Dr. Joe West plod- 
ded across the dark runway. His 



footsteps clumped toward the 
silhouette of the aircraft. 

His legs felt impossibly heavy. 
Swollen. But he thought his legs 
were as thin aS when he was an 
undernourished scholarship stu- 
dent at Harvard Med School. 

Imaginary heavy legs? Dr. Joe 



9 





West’s mouth split in a confused 
grin. Psychosomatic elephantia- 
sis? What had the C.I.A. given 
him? 

T Tis face was prison-thin as 
^ he plodded toward the air- 
craft. Staring at the cavernous 
air intakes under the variable 
sweep wings, Dr. West recogniz- 
ed the bomber as the last of the 
air breathers. 

Take-off is rocket assisted, 
too many G’s for my circulatory 
system, he thought dully. 

Probably when 2,500 miles per 
hour or some godawful starting 
speed was attained, the bomber^s 
ramjets would become operative, 
and it would flash like a torch 
through the night. Too fast! 

The exertion of walking made 
him gasp. His heartbeats faltered. 
At his side his C.I.A. bodyguard 
urged him on, and the distance 
to the bomber became excrutiat- 
ing. 

Imaginary heavy legs? Imag- 
inary was what one of the ex- 
citedly smiling faces in the Har- 
vard Circle had assured him. But 
in another room in the basement 
of C.I.A. headquarters, another 
doctor had reassured him that 
any slight swelling of his legs 
was merely a mild side effect 
of a mild sedative. Contra'dictory 
liars! Had they saved him or 
traded him off? 

His legs dragged like anchors 



as the Air Force ground crew 
boosted Dr. West up the steel 
ladder toward the belly of the 
intruder bomber. In his bemused 
condition, the tiny orifices pitting 
the stainless steel skin of the 
bomber looked like pores. This 
damned airplane was designed 
to fly too low, too fast! Did the 
pores exude sweat to protect its 
fuselage from the meteoric blaze 
of air friction? Several of these 
SCRAMjets had crashed. 

dorCt want to burn, he thought, 
almost panicking as they shov- 
ed him up into a confining metal 
tunnel in the aircraft. As he 
crawled, the glittering close walls 
hummed against his eardrums 
and clinked and echoed. Some- 
one was crawling close behind 
him. 

His legs dragging. Dr. West 
crawled with the strength of his 
arms and shoulders. His damned 
legs felt twenty pounds over- 
weight. His muscles shivered. His 
eyes blinked. His mouth twisted. 

Mild sedative? Like heck! He 
felt as disoriented as if he’d un- 
dergone narcohypnosis. 

His straining arms pulled him 
into the cramped electronic coun- 
ter-measures capsule of the 
bomber. Unexpectedly his head 
bumped the low ceiling, and his 
eyes widened with claustropho- 
bia. The angry world closed on 
him like a fist. He tried to turn.

Not enough room for two men 
in here! 

But a nameless Major was 
struggling in beside him. Massive 
and radiating he^t, the Major 
grunted. The pressure door 
clunked shut, sealing them in. 
Like twins in a womb they 
squirmed and politely elbowed 
each other. Dr. West realized 
they were seated facing back- 
ward toward the tail. Against 
him, the Major’s shoulder twist- 
ed; and the Major’s blue eyes 
loomed so close, they blurred. 

‘‘Let me fix your crash — I 
mean — safety harness.” The 
Major’s laugh was high pitched 
for such a huge man. 

“Here’s your crash helmet, 
you C.I.A. bum! They — ” A 
metallic shriek exploded. Lurch- 
ing forward, the bomber howled 
along the rimway, hurled it- 
self. 

Facing backward. Dr. Joe West 
felt his eyeballs bulge as ac- 
celeration dragged the nylon 
straps into his chest. Gawking 
down at the one tiny heat- 
insulated viewplate between his 
boots, he glimpsed discolored 
clouds. The dark mountains of 
the California coastline were 
backlighted by the sunrise. In- 
congruously, obscenely, the sun- 
rise sank into the mountains. 

Dr. West realized the bomber 
had activated its ramjets. It was 
out-speeding the turning Barth. 



The dawn drowned. The dark- 
ening Pacific Ocean glittered as 
this lone bomber hurried to over- 
take the night. Only in darkness 
could its cargo survive. 

T he Air Force Major squirmed. 

“Hope you ' — I mean — 
Central Intelligence — you 
spooks can’t just send us off 
and kill us — without telling 
us the mission?” The Major’s 
laughter rose like the safety 
valving of a steam boiler. “The 
generals shook our hands too 
much. The brass didn’t level with 
us at the briefing.” 

“I wasn’t at the briefing,” Dr. 
West muttered. 

“Why don’t you C.I.A* spooks 
use your own black planes?” the 
Major laughed explosively. “The 
way your Deputy Director is 
buddying around with the Pres- 
ident, your Central Intelligence 
already owns more manned air- 
craft that the Air Force. So 
send one of your own black clun- 
kers. This SCRAMjet bomber 
cost fifty million bucks, and we 
got damn few of them.” 

Dr. West didn’t know what to 
answer. His head hurt. 

“That was a controDed-envir- 
onment tank they hoisted into 
our bomb bay,” the Major’s voice 
persisted. “Too heavy. Hell of 
a long take-off run. Heavy spray 
tank. Too heavy. So tell me 
we’re going to spray crops.”

n 




The Major shovelled sarcasm. 
‘T mean — the Air Force is not 
officially at war, you Imow. I 
can't speak for the C.IJl. Have 
your spooks got Presidential ap- 
proval for this mission? Does he 
know what's in the spray tank?” 
“He may. I don't,” the Major 
laughed, squirming, tiying to re- 
adjust the leather holster on his 
hip. 

Dr. West contorted his body, 
trying to give the Major leBibw 
room. The Major was lowing 
too explosive a personaHty, and 
it was difficult to estimate fiow 
he would react if he recognized 
Dr. West At least the Majot; was 
not piloting the bomber. Dr. 
West wet his dry lips. 

nphe aircraft's flight steadied. 

^ ^^Autopilot's switched' to as- 
tro-inertial guidance,” the Major 
said. ^TJp front Colonel Neller 
can take his nap. But I got a 
personal reason for finding out 
what's in the spray tank.” 

Dr. West wished the Major 
would chut upl 
Speechless, Dr. West shook 
his head. Hfe eardrunis were kill- 
ing him. Strapped to his side as 
closely as a Siamese twin, the 
Major eyeballed him. “You feel 
okay?” 

Dr. West blinked at the Ma- 
jor's enormously dose face. 
Plainly the Major had not rec- 
ognized him from the T.V. news, 



and Dr. West tried to relax. 
Sometimes when people recog- 
nized Dr. West, they tried to 
kill him. 

“The Colonel up there in the 
control module and you and me, 
all three in the hot seat,” the 
Major persisted. “We’ll fry to- 
gether, so what's in the spray 
tank?” 

Dr. Joe West furrowed his 
brow. Clumsily, he tried to 
scratch his armpit without el- 
bowing the Major. Within his 
nylon flying suit Dr. West's body 
was perspiring in the padded cot- 
ton rags of a Chinese commune 
worker, deceased. He couldn't 
remember if he had been told 
what was in the ^ray tank. 

Something alive was crawling 
up his ribs. Hungrily, it bit. Dr. 
West’s face lifted in his pained 
grin. Evidently for authentidty 
the Central Intelligence Agency 
had salted his rags with genuine 
Chinese Communist fleas. 

Another bite! Grinning like a 
befuddled skeleton. Dr. West 
imagined when his last drop of 
blood had been drunk, the fleas 
would arise in unison and jshout: 
“Paper Tiger!” Then in glorious 
self-defense and in order to pre- 
serve international peace, the 
fleas would infiltrate the Major. 

But the Major would not be 
another Burma, or Pakistan, The 
Major’s profile, twelve inches 
from the Doctor's eyes, appeared 



12 



GALAXY 




massive and forbidding. His 
te^th ^ere grinding with tension. 
The Major would not negotiate 
with fleas. Or men. 

The Major’s thick forefinger 
poked the black box on the Doc- 
tor’s lap. ‘‘That’s wired to the 
spray tank. Hey, this dial is at 
98.6 degrees! Is that Fahrenheit? 
That’s the temperature of the 
human body. What has the C.I.A. 
got us carrying? 

“How should I know,” Dr. 
West’s mouth answered as if 
it had been trained. “I’m only a 
biotechnician who twists the dials 
and gets shot.” But he knew 
he was a medical doctor! “I’m 
not even C.I.A.” That was true. 
Even his mouth wanted to dis- 
associate him from the C.I.A. 
“I wasn’t even at the flight brief- 
ing.” 

“All they showed us was a 
turning point at the end of our 
fuel range.” The Major opened 
his hand, then flattened it like 
a wing and thrust! “Target a 
couple of himdred miles inland 
on the deck — minimum altitude. 
The Chicomms are more apt to 
knock us down with a tree or a 
hut roof or a radio tower than 
with A. A. missiles,” the Major 
laughed, his forehead beaded with 
sweat. “I need to know what’s 
in the spray tank and to know it 
now.” 

He unzipped the front of his 
flying suit. 



D r. West’s throat clicked, not 
much of a laugh. Here he 
was with ‘ an agricultural com- 
mune costume concealed under 
his fl 3 dng suit, and the Major in 
Air Force blues. He hoped this 
was only an oversight, a t 3 rpi- 
cal lack of coordination between 
the Air Force and the C.I.A. as 
to escape dress. Their costumes 
didn’t match. Obviously one man 
could not eject without the other. 
Aircraft this fast didn’t carry 
parachutes. 

“What’s in the spray — ” 

“If the plane is hit — ” 

The two men spoke simultan- 
eously, but the Major proved to 
be the more courteous. He an- 
swered the Doctor’s question. 

“If we’re hit, blooie!” The Ma- 
jor’s teeth flashed white. 

“I mean if we’re only dam- 
aged.” 

“They’ll never touch us. You’re 
not setting in one of your black- 
painted C.I.A. clunkers now. This 
is the real Air Force. The Chinks 
haven’t upgraded their A.A. 
missiles in ten years.” 

Dr. West scratched his flea 
bites and supposed the Major 
probably was accurate. For the 
last fifteen years the Chinese 
had been concentrating their 
limited industrial capacity on 
gigantic, million-p o un d-thrust, 
solid fuel I.C.B.M.’s with big, 
dirty hundred-megaton war- 
heads. Their successful strategy 



OUR MAN IN PEKING 



13 




had been continual infiltration 
and limited warfare. Their moves 
were shielded by blackmail 
based on the avowed Chinese 
policy of massive nuclear re- 
taliation. 

The Chinese did not bother 
with modem antiaircraft or anti- 
I.C.B.M. systems. In the U.N. 
General Assembly^ the Chinese 
representative alternately stated 
that no umbrella was needed for 
their two billion-plus population 
and that all umbrellas are fu- 
tile. When he was in a bene- 
volent mood, the Chinese repre- 
sentative would smile and state 
that huge countries like the Unit- 
ed States and the Chinese Con- 
federation of Nations were equal- 
ly vulnerable. 

In the back of Dr. West’s skull 
he realized, remembered this air- 
craft was aimed much deeper 
than a few hundred miles into 
China. It would be penetrating 
far beyond its fuel point of no 
return. 

II 

4CA yrajor, rephrasing my ques- 

-^^-^tion, what happens to us 
if the plane has, say, mechanical 
difficulties?” 

‘‘Doc, you don’t sound very 
confident about the maintenance 
procedures of your Air Force. 
Suppose we have a quadruple 
flame-out right now over the Pa- 



cific,” the Major laughed. “For- 
ward in the control module, lone- 
ly old Colonel Neller pulls a 
lever. Blooie! His capsule ejects. 
Our sealed capsule ejects straight 
up, and at the top of the arc 
we get all loose and weightless 
like we’re modern young guys in 
the Space Corps and not obso- 
lete, old, manned-aircraft per- 
sonnel. Our drogue chute opens, 
then our big chute jerks open, 
and we come down to Earth. No 
sweat. We float in a whole Pa- 
cific Ocean of sweat. What I 
need to know is what’s in our 
spray tank, Doc?” 

Dr. West sat rigid. The Major 
twice had addtessed him as 
“Doc”. 

“What dirty soup is in our 
spray tank. Doc,” the Major’s 
voice persisted. 

Dr. West couldn’t speak. He 
was afraid, in a moment the Ma- 
jor would say, oat to mouse : 
“Doc, is your last name West?” 

“You feel okay,” the Major’s 
voice asked. 

Dr. West pointed at his mouth, 
made swallowing gestures, shook 
his head. He couldn’t speak, nau- 
seated. 

Violently he had been de- 
nounced in the U.N. General As- 
sembly. Both the United States 
and Canada had been implicated 
and denounced by a dozen orien- 
tal countries. That was ten years 
ago when there still were indi- 



14 



GALAXY 




vidual oriental nations. The Chi- 
nese People’s Republic had put 
on the biggest dramatic produc- 
tion, giving humane refuge to 
several hundred Eskimo survi- 
vors. 

Canadian and American lynch 
mobs had demonstrated outside 
Dr. West’s pirison. ‘‘Save our Es- 
kimos,” they chanted. “Everyone 
has a right to live.” Their wav- 
ing signs demanded an end to 
genocide. “An end to murder,” 
their eager young voices shout- 
ed as they battered at the prison 
gates. “Give us Dr. West! Kill 
him!” 

Dr. West bowed his head. It 
was true. He was a murderer. 
He had been convicted of geno- 
cide. The Canadian prison had 
closed on him like a softly smoth- 
ering fist. The ramjet bomber 
howled and shuddered, and Dr. 
West realized it was slanting 
down into the denser atmosphere. 
Already the bomber was more 
than halfway across the Pacific. 
The viewplate between his boots 
was black as the night beneath, 
mirroring his eyes. 

44TT^hat’s in the spray tank. 
Doc?” The Major sound- 
ed personally concerned. “You’re 
too old to be a C.I.A. biotech- 
nician. I mean — they’re kids in 
their twenties, just knob twisters. 
You’re someone big. When those 
C.I.A. spooks shoved you into 



the aircraft, one of them slipped 
his tongue. I heard him call you 
‘Doc’. So I figured you got a 
Ph.D. Maybe you’re even a mem- 
ber of the Harvard Circle in the 
C.I.A. You must know what we’re 
flying into — ” 

To Dr. West’s relief the Ma- 
jor was proceeding along the 
wrong track. He still had not 
recognized Dr. West. 

“That spray tank was airlifted 
into Edwards Air Force Base in 
a big old C5,” the Major per- 
sisted. “Word is the C5 came 
from Arkansas. Pine Bluff, 
Arkansas. An arsenal there. Even 
I know that’s where they breed 
the microbes. You’re a top scien- 
tist or C.I.A. or both.” The Ma- 
jor slapped his pistol holster. 
“You’re not expendable like me. 
I mean this mission must be cru- 
cial. Is this the beginning? The 
spray tank? Are we going to 
kill millions of Chicoms?” 

“No one will die.” 

“No one will die — like hell!” 
the Major exploded. “We’ll be 
crossing the Chink coastline in a 
few minutes. In a few more min- 
utes we’ll reach our turn around 
point. We can’t go any farther, 
and by that time something will 
happen, courtesy of you C.I.A. 
spooks. I don’t even think I want 
it to happen! The President said 
we would never be first to use 
germ warfare!” 

“What do you want?” The

OUR AAAN IN PEKING 




Doctor’s fear and rage and frus- 
tration exploded against the Ma- 
jor. “You’re damned hysterical 
for an obsolete military mind 
who has been eating out of the 
public trough for twenty years? 
What do you want? A nice clean 
antiseptic hydrogen bomb?” 

“Just tell me the mission, Doc.” 
The Major’s voice became sur- 
prisingly patient. “Colonel Nel- 
ler and I got a right to know 
what we’re risking our lives for. 
That spray tank may be warm- 
ed to 98.6 degrees, but it’s no 
nutrient solution for babies. 
There’s no three-eyed Chink 
dragon monster swimming in that 
tank. I mean — ” The Major 
closed his eyes. 

Evidently the Major was lis- 
tening to the Colonel through the 
intercom. He peered at Dr. West. 
“Instruments indicate we just 
crossed the Chinese coastline 
north of Canton.” 

“Hey!” the Major exclaimed. 
“Less than fifteen minutes, and 
we got to turn around. Doc, what 
are your orders? You better start 
spraying!” 

Dr. West sat there. “When the 
red light comes on — on this 
box — the sequence will begin.” 
He remembered that much. 

^T^he aircraft shuddered as it 
rammed through the thick- 
ening atmosphere. A fiery glow 
engulfed the viewplate beneath 



the Doctor’s feet. We must be 
down on the deck, the Doctor 
thought, imagining mountains 
and radio towers and cliffs loom- 
ing ahead. 

The bomber was dependent 
upon the precise functioning of 
its terrain-following radar. 

“You’d better press that spray 
button! We’re nearing our fuel 
point of no return,” the Major 
shouted louder than was neces- 
sary. An excited smile be- 
gan squirming across his face. 
“There’s no time left. Do it. Give 
it to him. We’re as low as we can 
fly. Dust Mao Ill’s armpits. God 
help the Chinese and all of us!” 

Dr. West glanced at the trem- 
bling face. The Major’s reactions 
seemed to be oscillating between 
excitement and revulsion. 

“We’re gonna give it to ’em! 
What are we giving the Chinks? 
Q-fever?” the Major’s voice raced 
on. “Pneumonic plague when you 
press that black box on your 
lap? Mutated scrub typhus? Ter- 
rific! Terrible! I can see the 
black box is set for fifteen min- 
utes spray duration. God! That’s 
a long time. Fifteen minutes! 
Flying slowed down to 2,000 
miles per hour, fifteen minutes 
makes a spray line 500 miles 
long! 

“I’m not stupid,” the Major 
shouted. “There’s ten hours of 
nig|;it over South China. Ten 
hours before the sun dries out

GALAXY 




your aerosol microbes. Ten 
hours of damp night while the 
sleeping Chinese breathe. For 
ten hours the wind will blow. 
You C.I.A. spooks always know 
which way the wind is blowing. 
Even if its blowing only ten 
miles per hour across our spray 
line, that’s a hundred miles the 
aerosol fog will sweep before the 
daylight comes. The Chinks! 
God; What’s the incubation per- 
iod?” 

Dr. West did not know what 
to answer. 

‘T’m not stupid,” the Major 
laughed excitedly. **We even 
studied arithmetic in the Air 
Academy. Five hundred miles of 
spray line multiplied by the wind 
carrying the fog a hundred miles 
across the line, covers five thous- 
and square miles. No, that’s fifty 
thousand square miles! How 
many sleeping Chinks in our fifty 
thousand square miles?” 

‘‘Unfortunately, very few,” Dr. 
West retorted, but immediately 
regretted it. 

“Very few? Like we’re not real- 
ly flying over China?” the Major 
laughed, and his face twisted in 
an agonized grin. “Wish the 
radar that’s tracking us was our 
own. I wish this was an exercise 
over the Pacific. I mean — like 
when I was in the last B-58’s, 
and I was so young I was un- 
killable. Hey, Colonel,” he laugh- 
ed, pressing the throat button of 



bis beimet mi^e. ”L;aionei, leii 
me this mission is an exercise.” 
The Major stopped talking. 
Listening, he closed his eyes. He 
coughed. The Major coughed un- 
controllably. 

The Major’s huge face whirled. 
“You C.I.A. bum,” he yelled into 
Dr. West’s face. “The aircraft’s 
captured by it’s autopilot. 
Colonel says he’s smashed the 
auto pilot, and he still can’t gain 
control. Hidden somewhere on 
this aircraft is another operating 
autopilot. For some reason you 
want to make sure we can’t come 
home.” 

C onsciously, Dr. West had not 
known this. But he must 
have known this was a one-way 
flight because his organism ex- 
perienced neither violent surprise 
nor additional fear. 

With disappointment. Dr. West 
wondered whether, with all the 
political pressure the Harvard 
Circle of the C.I.A. had exerted 
to remove him from prison, after 
all the valuable time the Harvard 
Circle had spent to rejuvenate 
him and to carry out parapsy- 
chological tests, after he had be- 
gun to think he was important 
again, they had decided he was 
no better than an expendable 
technician. Wasted. Expendable. 

On the black box on his lap 
the red light flickered. Without 
thought, his thumb pressed the 



OUR MAN IN PEKING 



17 




button as if it had been trained. 

‘‘Drop the spray tank!” the 
Major was insisting into his 
throat mike. “Save fuel. Save 
minutes. Listen, Colonel, we’re 
not working for the C.I.A. — ” 

Abruptly the Major closed his 
mouth as if the Colonel had said 
something equally abrupt to him. 

From his holster, the Major 
hauled out the heavy .45 auto- 
matic pistol. At a range of six 
inches, its muzzle hole looked 
big enough to fall into. But Dr. 
West’s thumb remained on the 
button. He ignored the , gun. 

“I’m not going to blow your 
brains out,” the Major gasped. 
“I wanted to see what you’d do. 
The Colonel thinks it’s possible 
the Air Force brass agreed to let 
the C.I.A. do this to us. If that’s 
patriotism, I’m an orphan.” 

'"T^he bomber howled and buck- 
ed through updrafts. Dr. 
West knew the aircraft was lay- 
ing a trail of aerosol fog across 
the formerly desolate mountains 
of South Central China. 

“They should have told us,” 
the Major blurted. “I’m a pro- 
fessional. I should have been 
given the chance to volunteer. 
The Colonel and me, we’re go- 
ing to complete this spray run 
on the chance that the Air Force 
did agree to — sell us out. You 
C.I.A. spook, we’ve decided to 
complete the spraying mission.” 



The Major waved the almost 
prehistoric .45 automatic inef- 
fectually. “Now do you feel bet- 
ter or worse?” 

Dr. West surreptitiously had 
managed to raise his thumb from 
the button. At first his thumb 
had not wanted to release the 
button, as if it had an over- 
trained, one-track mind of its 
own. The flickering red light 
stayed on, and Dr. West knew 
the spraying was continuing any- 
way. Probably if he never had 
pressed the button, a back-up 
mechanism would have initiated 
the spraying. Probably he was not 
only expendable; he was super- 
fluous. 

Dr. West’s mouth twisted with 
the quick pain of his thoughts. 
The Major had just stated that 
the Colonel and he had “de- 
cided” to complete the spraying 
mission. But the aircraft was fly- 
ing itself, predestined as a mis- 
sile. It would be too cruel to 
point out to the Major that no 
room had been allowed for hu- 
man decisions. Plainly, the Ma- 
jor needed to believe he had 
‘decided.” The Major still was 
clinging to his illusion of free de- 
cision. 

“I would like to blow yoiir 
brains out,” the Major repeated 
and savagely hand operated the 
slide mechanism, ejecting an un- 
fired cartridge from the auto- 
matic pistol. 



18 



GALAXY 




Pr. West looked away. He 
wondered if other military per- 
sonnel still wore .45 automatics. 
His own grandfather had kept 
one beneath his folded T shirts 
in the top drawer. Way back in 
World War II, his grandfather 
had carried it at Kasserine Pass. 
He said he never fired it. Vague- 
ly, Dr. West remembered that 
the .45 Colt Government auto- 
matic had been Model 1911. 
1911? Three generations of offi- 
cers must have carried these 
hand-cannons. Before the First 
World War, this very heavy 
caliber automatic had been de- 
signed to knock ^ down charging 
bolo-waving Moro tribesman, oir 
so his granndfather had said. 

The spraying aircraft bucked 
savagely, whether from an anti- 
aircraft missile explosion or a 
mountain updraft Dr. West did 
not know. The Major cursed, 
and Dr. West smiled because it 
felt good to know that someone 
else was mor^ frightened than 
he was. The Major was quite a 
character. 

The Major appeared to be 
about forty-five years old and 
obsolete. He had picked the 
wrong Armed Service. There now 
were five Armed Services com- 
peting for younger men. The 
most clean-cut young men who 
wanted to completely leave this 
crowded world volunteered for 
the Space Corps and made world- 



televised crash landings on the 
Martian craters. More subtle 
young men with a flair for for- 
eign languages joined the C.I.A., 
which had acquired its own sub- 
marine and VTOL air force to 
deliver its armored vehicles and 
heavily armed guerilla war ex- 
perts. The Navy still owned 
shoals of nuclear subs and its 
hulking aircraft carriers and the 
arrogant Marines. The Army had 
managed to acquire a transport 
air force and aerial cavalry and 
to retain some big tanks, which 
were used in parades, and con- 
trol of tactical and defensive 
missiles. The poor old Air Force 
was left with its vast seedbeds 
of I CBM silos, a few transport 
planes and obsolete interceptors, 
only a dozen of these operational 
ramjet bambers, and the Ma- 
jor and his .45. 

C4Tf by any chance you C.I.A. 

A turncoats have rigged the 
autopilot to deliver our aircraft 
to the Chinks,” the Major blurt- 
ed, ‘T will blow your brains out.” 
‘Tf we land anywhere we’ll be 
too lucky,” Dr. West retorted. 
‘‘Right now we’re spraying across 
the interior of China. The people 
down there have been indoctrinat- 
ed for two generations that we 
bring germ warfare. They’ll greet 
us with yells and shrieks and 
fingernails and sharp hoes.” 

At this, the Major showed his 

19 



OUR MAN IN PEKING 




Ill 



big teeth. “You’re full of fun and 
games.” He thudded his .45 auto- 
matic across his knee. “Chinks 
won’t make me apologize and 
curse my country on internation- 
al television. Your two C.I.A. 

I 

jerks, what were their names, 
Johnson and Mitsui? Pitiful per- 
formance. Doesn’t the C.I.A. is- 
sue cyanide capsules? Couldn’t 
those two jerks swallow? In the 
Air Force we don’t need cyanide 
capsules.” 

He waved his .45 like a magic 
wand. “If we crash. I’ll use the 
first five bullets on Chinks, and 
then — ” 

Dr. West remembered that the 
.45 automatic holds a seven-i^ot 
clip. He remembered the tor- 
tured face of Johnson. 

The televised faces of John- 
son and Mitsui had been bounced 
off Telstar satellite, and they 
were seen confessing to every- 
thing from dropping virulent 
hepatitus bombs to potato bugs. 
Their agonizing scenes had set 
record Neilson Ratings for their 
nonpaying sponsor, the Chin- 
ese Federation of Nations, and 
sold American mothers on some 
of the positive advantages of 
isolationism. 

The aircraft quivered. The red 
light on the black box on Dr. 
West’s lap flickered out. The 
spray run was complete. 

As if on cue, the bomber ex- 
ploded. 



D r. West, who had rejected 
life, who had willingly faced 
the mob, who had made the hard 
moral decision for Eskimo geno- 
cide, who had faced his con- 
viction and the angry fist of the 
world opinion, now screamed for 
life. 

In total darkness his body 
whirled, slower and slower. He 
floated in his nylon safety har- 
ness, weightless as a drowned 
man. 

Ah abrupt jolt whiplashed his 
neck. The swooping side-to- 
side, revolving, swinging, rocking 
slamined his head against the 
wall of the capsule. Dr. West 
finally realized the capsule had 
been ejected from the bomber 
and the capsule’s parachute al- 
ready had opened. 

In the hoarse breathing des- 
cending pendulum silence of the 
capsule, Dr. West’s hand crept 
to his slippery mouth. He bit 
his hand. The capsule was des- 
cending regardless of what he 
did. The explosion, the ejection 
from the bomber had been pro- 
grammed. The smiling faces in 
the Harvard Circle of the Cen- 
tral Intelligence Agency had de- 
livered him to China. 

“Why me? I never volunteered 
for this,” he said. “You C.I.A. 
wretches, my narcohypnosis has 
worn pff. You may think you 



20 



GALAXY 




conditioned my responses like an 
experimental animars. IVe got 
news for you. It’s worn off. I’m 
free!” Whatever program was 
in his skull, as it emerged Dr. 
West determined he would sna- 
fu it, foul it up. 

‘I’ll sell out; I’ll bug out. I 
owe no allegiance to a country 
who would do this to a man. I’ve 
got one ambition, to save my 
neck and to hell with you!” 

The capsule struck the earth. 
Dr. West raised his head in 
the blinding darkness of the cap- 
sule. He shook the Major’s slack 
shoulder. A gurgling sound — 
With shock. Dr. West felt his 
foot was wet. He groped down. 
Too much liquid to be blood. 
The gurgling sound was more 
distinct when he stopped breath- 
ing. 

Water was leaking into the 
smashed bottom of the capsule. 

A one in a million spot-land- 
ing, Dr. West thought. Instead 
of striking the mountainsides in 
this formerly desolate western 
interior of Szechuan Province, 
the capsule must have descend- 
ed into a precipitious river val- 
ley where water was — This 
is what Dr. West thought. — 
Szechuan Province? 

Until now he had not remem- 
bered the landing was to be in 
Szechuan Province. “Memory — 
triggered!” He realized the land- 
ing of the capsule had unblocked 



data the C.I.A. had drilled into 
his memory. Now he could even 
visualize the map. The terrain, 
changing sets of spy-in-sky pho- 
tographs were riffled before his 
inner eyes. 

The slender fingers of Dr. 
George Pruning had paused be- 
side an oval dot on the aerial 
photo. “Another new irrigation 
reservoir.” Dr. Bruning’s calm- 
ly intelligent face smiled across 
the table at him. 

D r. George Bruning was no 
medical doctor. He was a 
former boy wonder, a former 
geophysicist, a former scientific 
astronaut, whose two lovable 
children and smiling wife and 
publicity in Life Mag had re- 
sulted in his election to The 
House of Representatives. His 
political defeat by a movie star 
two years later resulted in his 
appointment to the President’s 
Scientific Advisory Staff. He 
was photographed playing cro- 
quet with the President. He was 
promoted to Chief Scientific Ad- 
visor. 

The unexpected defection of 
Australia to Neutralism resulted 
in wholesale firings in the Cen- 
tral Intelligence Agency. Dr. 
George Bruning was appointed 
by the President as Deputy Di- 
rector of the C.I.A. George might 
be inexperienced in the use of 
cloak and dagger, but he soon

showed himself to be an or- ^ . 
ganizer. His own agency emerg- 
ed within the Agency and gained ^ 
the newspaper label ‘^Harvard 
Circle”. By a noncoincidence, V 
not only had Dr. George Brun- ' 
ing and his four top assistants j 
attended Harvard as undergrad- ' 
uates, so had the President of 
the United States. 

*'So what’s the big deal?” Dr. « 
West hissed, struggling to un- 
buckle his nylon safety harness. 

No explanation, but odd details 
emerged from the outer layer 
of his memory — instructions. 

He remembered that there was 
a special landing kit attached un- 
der the seat. A detail, but it 
was a remarkable feat of mem- 










V *r 











ory because he had never looked 
under the seat. His hand felt it 
though. He could visualize its 
contents laid out on a white 
table. Total partial recall. 

“You miserable wretches, 
you’re rationing me details.” Dr. 
West’s hands lifted the metal 
kit and attached it to a pre- 
arranged hook inside the vol- 
uminous padded jacket of his 
Chinese worker’s costume. 

“You’re all very stupid if you 
think I can pass for a Chinese 
just because I’m a student of 
oriental population problems.” 
Dr. West knew his laughter was 
frightened with hysteria. “Un- 
fortunately I’ve a pale prison 
complexion like a Swede, big 



brown eyes like an Italian and a 
long jawbone like a Scotsman.” 
Plainly he was outfitted in this 
agricultural commune costume 
for some reason other than to 
pass as a Chinese at close range. 

Water continued to gurgle into 
the capsule. Dr. West’s nostrils 
detected the faint, yet fetid odor 
that emanates from steams pol- 
luted by humanity. There were 
no sounds of people outside the 
capsule. 

Not even a frog croaked in the 
night outside. 

TTrom his escape kit. Dr. West’s 
^ hand detached a small, 
heavy, no larger than a woman’s 
compact, radio. He knew it was 
was an automatic signal sender. 
In order to extend the aerial his 
hands were trained to locate the 
upper air vent in the darkness, 
to twist it open and project the 
aerial like a collapsible fishing 
rod into the Chinese night. Dr. 
West crouched in the blackness 
of the capsule with his legs in 
the rising water and his thumb on 
the signal-switch of the minia- 
turized ionospheric-;ricochet ra- 
dio beacon. He knew it was 
broadcasting a continuous signal 
to someone. 

He suposed his body had been 
trained in a mock-up of this ejec- 
tion capsule, but he couldn’t re- 
member that yet. “You chose 
me, but you didn’t trust me. Only

part of my memory, part of my 
conditioning has been unblocked. 
But I won’t wait for the cues like 
a trained dog. I’m going to tear 
apart your conditioning, Sammy.” 

Dr. Sammy Wynoski had been 
a medical doctor, and before that, 
by a noncoincidence, Sammy 
W3moski had been an imdergrad- 
uate at Harvard. Joe West had 
not attended Harvard as an un- 
dergraduate, but he had received 
a partial scholarship to the Har- 
vard Graduate School of Medi- 
cine. An inarticulate, intense 
kook named Sammy Wynoski 
had roomed next to him during 
his final years. 

Dr. Joe West had returned to 
the Coast to specialize in endo- 
crinology, which led to research 
in Arctic ecology, which led to 
population control research ^d 
to the exalted position of Direc- 
tor of Oriental Population Prob- 
lems Research at the University 
of California, from which job 
he was canned, and back to the 
Arctic where he had enough 
courage to uncover the real 
cause of the Eskimo population 
explosion and to try to do some- 
thing positive before it was too 
late. For this, he was sentenced 
to life imprisonment. For this, 
had the C.I.A. freed him? 

During those hectic years, Dr. 
Sam Wynoski had been quietly 
specializing in chemopsychiatry, 
with an increasing number of 



week-end jobs as a medical con- 
sultant to the Central ' lAtelli- 
gence Agency. When good old 
Han^'Erdman George Bruning was 
appointed Deputy Director, Sam- 
my Wynoski answered his coun- 
try’s call, his Harvard school 
buddy’s phone call, and became 
a full-time member of the Har- 
vard Circle of the C.I.A. 

Thus Dr. Joe West and Dr. 
Sammy Wynoski met after ten 
phis X years in the basement of 
C.I.A. headquarters. They were 
at opposite ends of a hypodermic 
needle which Dr. Sam Wynoski 
apologetically inserted into Dr. 
Joe West’s arm. 

CCT’ve been following your — 

Auh — career, Joe,” Dr. Sam 
W3moski had said. “That — uh 
— prison haircut looks real fuz- 
zy.” 

Dr. West had been in no con- 
dition to answer. 

“You bunch of amateurs,” Dr. 
West muttered, crouching in the 
flooding capsule. “Have you got 
any plan?” 

Then the Major groaned. Dr. 
West’s pulse rate jumped. His 
wrist gave a nervous jerk of its 
own volition. 

“We do — something!” the 
Major’s voice blurted, and he 
whispered : “Any Chinks out 

there? — What you doing?” 

“Nothing,” Dr. West’s voice 
replied soothingly. “Our best 



24 



GALAXY 




hope is to stay in the capsule.” 
For some reason, his fingers 
twisted his wristwatch to the un- 
derside of his wrist. 

^^Damn capsule — flooding,” 
the Major grunted. **We got to 
get out of here fast.” From the 
thraidiing, it sounded as if the 
Major was having difficulty dis- 
engaging himself from his safe- 
ty harness and assorted intercom 
wires and oxygen tubes. 

*TVe stay here!” Dr. West’s 
voice stated, his pulse rate ac- 
celerating as if teadying him for 
violent comGat. He realized — 
he rem^Bered, when he tipped 
back his wrist as He was now do- 
ings an injectioa needle emerged 
from his wiistwatch. 

*lf the faceless airman be- 
comes uncooperative,” Dr. Sam- 
my Wynosld had explained, 
^^simply prick him with the 
wristwatch needle.” Otherwise 
Dr. West was to wait. He was 
not to kill the faceless airman 
until the proper strategic mo- 
ment. Dr. West began to shiver. 
He had not remembered this un- 
til now. 

He had no intention of mur- 
dering die Major. He had no 
intention of murdering anyone, 
not even a Chinese. 

'‘Those sons of bitdies!” Dr. 
West blurted, in his memory 
studjdng Dr. Sammy Wynoski’s 
apologetic face. 

"Yeah,” the Major wheezed, 



probably also referring to the 
C.I.A. and the two men collided 
in the darkness. 

Dr. West realized he almost 
had jabbed* the Major with the 
needle watch. With 'his other 
hand. Dr. West tried to tmbuckle 
the wristband. His fingers 
wouldn’t obey him. 

His fingers struggled against 
his orders. He felt as frustrated 
as a spastic as he gasped and 
sloshed about in the water. The 
wristwatch fell off his wrist. Suc- 
cess! One victory against the 
Harvard Circle. 

4i;i^ou all right?” the Major 

- ^ demanded. 

"Yes, fine. I feel much bet- 
ter. Let’s get out of here. You’re 
in command. Major.” 

"I’m going to unbolt the 
hatch.” 

"Hadn’t we better wait in the 
capsule?” 

"But you just said — let’s get 
out,” the Major hissed, per- 
plexed. Dr. West was contradict- 
ing himself. 

"The ignorant Chinese peasants 
can’t reach us, can’t torture us 
if we’re in the capsule.” Dr. 
West’s mouth talked fast. "Yes, 
they’ll think the capsule is one 
of Aeirs. Our best hope is for the 
People’s Militia to reach us. Still 
better is for the Maoist police 
to find us before the people 
lynch us. The capsule isn’t sink-

ing anymore. The water isn’t ris- 
ing. Probably we’re mired in a 
rice paddy. Our only hope is to 
stay in the capsule.” 

“You gone crazy or something? 
A minute ago you wanted out. 
Get out of this capsule!” The 
Major bodily shoved Dr. West 
through the hatch into the mud. 

Under Dr. West’s submerged 
hands was the bristly feel of new- 
ly transplanted rice seedlings. 

He lifted his gaze up a steep- 
ly terraced mountainside to the 
night sky. 

Behind him, the Major thrash- 
ed out of the capsule into the 
mud and sloshed about in the 
darkness. With a gasp and a 
curse, the Major slipped off the 
crumbling edge of the narrow 
terrace into the rice paddy be- 
low. Those terraced rice pad- 
dies were little wider than a 
man’s arm span. 

The capsule had not descend- 
ed into a river valley. Dr. West 
saw that they had landed on a 
mountainside so steep that all 
this terracing would have been 
uneconomic for men. Immense 
labor would be required for the 
limited number of catties of rice 
the mountain could produce. 

The odors of the terrace mak- 
ers permeated the night air. 

“Stinks like human — fertili- 
zer,” the Major scramlbled back 
up the hand-packed mud slope. 
“Millions of Chinks.” 



“Not Chinese.” In his mem- 
ory Dr. West visualized photo- 
graphs of only five years ago 
showing these mountain^ deso- 
late and dry, completely im- 
economic for rice cultivation. 
During the last two or three 
years,* incredible energy had 
been expended on these moun- 
tain terraces. The mountains 
were too steep, the terraces too 
small for efficient use of 
machinery. Human cultivators 
would consume too much rice, 
more energy laboring here than 
the submarginal rice harvests 
would replace. Yet these moun- 
tains had been laboriously ter- 
raced, magically irrigated, fresh- 
ly handplanted with bristly new 
rice seedlings. 

“The moon is rising.” Like 
glittering liquid steps, the ter- 
raced rice paddies shimmered 
down the mountainside into the 
dark canyon. 

“I smell smoke,” the Major 
whispered. “Millions of Chinks 
down there.” 

Dr. West did not bother to 
disagree with him. Turning, he 
looked for the dim whiteness of 
another giant parachute, but 
there was no sign of Colonel 
Neller’s escape capsule.

T he Major held up his diin- 
ing wet hand, feeling for the

direction of the night breeze. 
*^God! I’m afraid the wind is 
coming from where we sprayed. 
Hell of a note if we get infected 
by our own spray. Got to move 
out of here fast!” 

Again, Dr. West did not both- 
er to disagree with him. Dr. 
West’s hand reached into his ny- 
lon flying suit and on into his 
commune worker’s rags, where 
his fingers closed on the handle 
of a dagger he had not known 
was sheathed there. 

The Major pulled at his shoul- 
der. 

‘‘Move out! You may be in- 
noculated, but I’m not.” 

“You don’t need to be afraid 
of this microbiological,” Dr. 
West’s voice replied smoothly. 
“Originally it was an unpredict- 
able bacteria infection of the 
staph-strep group. When I was 
Director of Oriental Population 
Problem Research at U.C. the 
Defense Department gave us a 
contract. We were to breed a 
variety of mutated strains, re- 
sistant to the usual antibiotics.” 
“Let’s go.” The Major shrilled. 
“Listen carefully,” Dr. West’s 
voice continued. “The particular 
strain in our aerosal spray is be- 
lieved harmless to humans. Fred 
Gatson, v{ho was on my staff at 
U.C. as my Chief Bacteriologist, 
is convinced that adequate tests 
have been conducted. This strain 
only affects — ” 



“Let’s go, let’s go!” the Major 
interrupted. 

“A mild infection settles in the 
Fallopian tubes and in the sper- 
matic ducts.” 

“Sterilized,” the Major grunt- 
ed in partial imderstanding. 
“Kill ’em before they’re born. 
Yeah, kill Chinks before they’re 
conceived. Yeah, typically C.I.A. 
Let’s get the hell out of here.” 

“Not Chinese. No need to 
leave.” Dr. West was remember- 
ing the cherubic face of Dr. Fred 
Gatson. Recent Harvard grad, 
Fred Gatson had been even 
yoimger than Dr. West when 
their were the big wheels in 
Oriental Population Problems 
Research. When Dr. Joe West 
was fired as Director, amazingly. 
Dr. Fred Gatson had been ap- 
pointed to replace him. 

Second surprise, when the 
C.I.A. “freed” Joe West from his 
life sentence and imprisoned him 
in the basement of C.I.A. head- 
quarters, Dr. Fred Gatson bash- 
fully reappeared. It turned out 
Fred had scrambled still higher 
up the ladder of success. Dr. 
Fred Gatson was now a mem- 
ber of the Harvard Circle of the 
C.I.A. Facing Dr. West, Fred 
appeared xmcomfortable, but de- 
termined. Fred mostly described 
his most recent mutation of the 
staph-strep population control 
bacteria. “Quite strategic.” 

“It doesn’t affect people,” Dr. 



OUR MAN IN PEKING 



27 




West’s voice repeated reassur- 
ingly to the Major. “You don’t 
need to fear personal steriliza- 
tion. The bacterial mutation is 
quite specific. It only affects 
Esks. 

“Eskimos? They’re people. 
Same species. So it will affect 
me. You’re lying so I won’t pan- 
ic,” the Major blurted. “I have 
no intention of panicking. Let’s 
get away from this capsule! 
Double-time! If Chink peasants 
catch us here where we sprayed 
— I mean — we won’t father 
anything. They’ll butcher us. 
Right now I’m not worried about 
my virility. Let’s get out of 
here.” 

^-T^e Major’s heaving chest 
made a close target, but Dr. 
West managed to uncurl his own 
fingers from the handle of the 
concealed dagger. Those C.I.A. 
fellows were determined he 
should kill someone. Dr. West 
was equally determined he would 
not kill anyone. 

“We’ll have to take the escape 
radio,” Dr. West’s voice said. 

“What radio are you talking 
about?” 

“Continuous signal sender.” 
Dr. West removed it from the 
capsule. It barely filled the palm 
of his hand. 

Hope returned to the Major’s 
voice. “The C.I.A. is looking out 
for us! C.I.A. snatchplane going 



to pick us up? Or is this a guer- 
rilla wave length?” 

“Guerrilla — ” Dr. West lied; 
it was the communications wave 
length of the Maoist Police. 

“Let’s go!” The Major was 
pulling at him again, making 
Dr. West’s involuntary nervous 
system clench as if he had been 
conditioned to kill — 

“Doc, our best chance is to get 
far, far away from this capsule 
before daylight shows it to the 
Chinks down there.” The Major 
needed to clutch at any hope. 
“Then we hide and wait for 
the guerrillas.” 

. Dr. West tried to keep up with 
the Major as he lumbered and 
splashed along the terraces. Joe 
West suspected there were few, 
if any, Chinese asleep down there 
in the canyon. His legs dragged. 
His legs felt so heavy — 

His hand refused to let go 
of it, but he wanted to throw 
away the signal sender. Why 
should he obediently give him- 
self up to the Maoist police? 
Dr. West couldn’t make his fin- 
gers let go of the signal sender. 
“They really conditioned the 
carrying of this radio into my 
skull. 

“What?” The Major looked 
back. 

“Nothing.” Joe West staggered 
on. 

With devilish energy, the Ma- 
jor began clambering up the sides 



28 



GALAXY 




of terraces, ascending the moun- 
tain like a monkey up a giant 
staircase. Dr. West’s legs grew 
heavier and heavier, and he 
gasped for breath, dragging him- 
self up over terraces mainly by 
the strength of his arms. His leg 
felt like swollen corpses. “Mental 
elephantiasis? Imaginary heavy 
legs? Hell!” Dr. West wondered 
when he would remember exact- 
ly what they had done to his 
legs. 

“Hurry up,” the Major hissed 
from far above. 

T) ut Joe West already was ex- 
hausted. He gasped for 
breath, and his heart thudded 
heavily. As he struggled to climb 
over the lip of a terrace into 
the paddy, the muddy signal 
sender slipped out of his hand. 
The tiny radio slid back down 
the terrace wall. Dr. West clung 
there, then triumphantly bellied 
over into the rice paddy leaving 
the radio. 

His hands wanted to scramble 
back down and search for the 
signal sender. “Oh, but you can’t 
make me do it. No C.I.A. assas- 
sins give me orders.” He crawled 
forward across the paddy and 
struggled up the terrace above, 
leaving the radio lost in the 
darkness. “To hell with Har- 
vard! I’m free.” 

The Major came sliding back 
down. “Let me help you. That’s 



okay, you’re not in shape. Let’s 
go. I won’t leave you. Doc.” 

The Major unmercifully hoist- 
ed Joe West to his feet. Support- 
ing him, urging him, dragging 
him, the Major hauled Joe West 
up the terraced side of the moun- 
tain. Dr. West’s legs kept sag- 
ging. 

“That’s okay, do your best,” 
the Major gasped. “We’re Ameri- 
cans. We’ll stick together.” 

Dr. West wondered what the 
Major would say if and when he 
discovered Dr. West wore a Chin- 
ese commune worker’s clothes 
under his nylon flying suit. 

“Doc, Doc! Hey, where’s the 
little radio?” The Major began 
to shake him to search his outer 
pockets. 

“In my hand. No, I dropped 
it.” 

“You dropped it?” the Major 
shrilled. “You just dropped our 
only chance.” 

The Major scrambled back 
down the terrace, leaving Dr. 
West lying in the mud, listen- 
ing to the Major slosh about 
below him. There was not one 
chance in a million that anyone 
could find that signal sender in 
the dark. 

Dr. West lay there listening 
to his own uneven heartbeat. His 
heart sounded like ah candidate 
for an electronic pacemaker. 

“Best way to beat the Har- 
vard Circle — for my heart to 



DUR MAN IN PEKING 



29 




stop.” Dr. West stared up at the 
mcon; the Harvard Circle peered 
down at him from his imagina- 
tion. 

Dr. George Bruning — Deputy 
Director, C.I.A. 

Dr. Sammy Wynoski — Chemo- 
psychiatrist. 

Dr. Fred Gatson — Popula- 
tion control expert; basteriolo- 
gist. 

But there were two more mem- 
bers of the Harvard Circle! Dr. 
West's irregularly beating heart 
cued one of them out of his 
blocked memory. 

T^r. Einar R. Johansen had not 
been an acquaintance of Dr. 
West's, but Dr. West had rec- 
ognized him in the basement of 
C.LA. headquarters. Dr. Johan- 
sen was easily recognizable. Pho- 
tographs of such a pioneer heart 
surgeon frequently had appeared 
in medical journals. 

No doubt the horse-faced sur- 
geon had once studied at Har- 
vard, but more recently Dr. 
Johansen had been awarded a 
Ph.D. in electrical engineering 
from M.I.T. He was better 
known now as a neurosurgeon 
than as a heart surgeon, and still 
better known for his press con- 
ferences. He was the doctor who 
said: “The older I get, the softer 
my head, so the more I soak 
up. I learn more now than when 
I was a kid of forty. At this rate, 



when I'm eighty I'll revolutionize 
medicine." This enraged the 
A.M.A. 

On pop -science T.V. shows, Dr. 
Johansen played with electric^ 
eels without wearing rubber 
gloves. He was ingeniously 
grounded against electrocution. 
He was the first surgeon"' to 
design and install an electronic 
heart pacemaker which was pow- 
ered by the patient’s neuron elec- 
tricity. No internal batteries to 
wear out, no wires to fray, “My 
pacemaker lasts as long as the 
patient. Eh? Yes, longer!" 

The A.M.A. disapproved of 
such jovially irresponsible talk. 
Dr. Johansen's pictures no longer 
appeared in medical journals. His 
smiling horse face appeared in 
space journals. N.A.S.A. had re- 
tained him as a consultant to the 
Bio -Power project. The goal was 
a subminiature solid state trans- 
mitter utilizing a lifetime powet 
supply from the electrical energy 
of the astronaut's body. 

Where had the transmitter been 
implanted, the leg, the buttock? 
Dr. West's teeth gleamed in the 
moonlight. Some unlikely spot. 
Dr. West remembered Dr. Johah- 
sen's wrinkled face bending over^ 
him. An operating table? “Be- 
fore I’m through, sir," the old 
voice croaked, “You’ll be a veri-, 
table electric eel. Hah!" 

Then the anesthetic engulfed 
him. 



30 



GALAXY 




T^r. West lay in the muddy 
•^--^rice paddy. His legs adied^ 
He knew that Harvard Circle 
had not gone to all that trouble 
just to install a duplicate sig- 
nal sender in his leg. 

High below the stars an air- 
craft droned overhead, its red 
and green wing lights flitting. Dr. 
West knew the C.I.A. had not 
commandeered an Air Force 
ramjet to fly him over China 
merely to spray the Esks. An ex- 
pendable technician could do 
that. Yet the plan must have 
something to do with the Esks. 
The C.I.A. had selected him, and 
he was the man with the most 
unpopular theory about the Esks. 
He was the man who had been 
convicted of attempted genocide 
of the Eskimos. He was the most 
impopular man in the world. 

If the Maoist police caught 
him alive, if they recognized him 
as Dr. West, the mass murderer 
of the helpless Eskimos, the Chi- 
comms wouldn’t kill him if they 
realized he was Dr. West. 

The Chinese Federation of 
Nations jo3rfuHy would use him 
for political purposes. Other 
American had confessed to any- 
thing. Dr. West knew he was 
no stronger than they. 

He smiled with the ultimate 
fear and fumbled into his layers 
©f wet clothing for the dag- 
ger. The Maoists would have 
enjoyed parading him. Even Mao 



III, who had been neither seen 
nor photographed for three years, 
had expressed the desire to face 
“the murderous Dr. West, eye 
to eye!” 

Dr. West struggled to remove 
the dagger from its sheath. 
“Those fools, those stupid C:*I.A. 
fools!” If the Chicomms took him 
alive, their glib diplomats would 
use him like acid to dissolve 
any last world goodwill the 
United States had managed to 
retain. Piously the Chinese rep- 
resentative would tell the Gen- 
eral Assembly: “Any nation who 
would parachute the murderous 
convict Dr. West upon another 
nation must be guilty of more 
than germ warfare, more than 
genocide — ” 

Dr. West spat in the mud. He 
was imable to make his hand 
draw out the dagger. “You poor 
thing. You’re as helpless as an 
imperialist potato bug complete 
with implicating little parachute 
and U.S. insignia on your wing 
covers. Even the C.I.A. can’t be 
that stupid. They must see one 
move beyond what I’m seeing. 

The Major emerged grunting 
over the edge of the terrace. 
“Foimd it. I’ll carry the signal 
sender now.” 

Dr. West opened his mouth. 
He wanted to tell the Major tiiat 
the signal sender was tuned for 
the Maoist police wavelength, 
but he couldn’t get the words out. 



OUR MAN IN PEKING 



31 




Instead he followed the Major 
across the rice paddy and up 
the next terrace, and the next, 
and the next — 

The Major came back and 
helped him again. “Do your best. 
Easy does it, old man.” 

Dr. West was not an old man, 
at least he had been a vigorous 
young man when he was sentenc- 
ed to prison. But his legs were 
an old man’s legs, unbelievably 
heavy. 

“When we get to the top,” the 
Major gasped, “I’m hoping 
there’ll . uninhabited canyon 
on the other side. We can hide 
until . guerrillas trace . 
our radio signal.” 

“In China, no place is unin- 
habited any more,” Dr. West 
said. 

“You got the wrong attitude 
. mustn’t give up . your 
C.I.A. guerrillas . come for 
us.” The Major 'raised the tiny 
radio signal sender, which was 
squeaking their location to any 
Maoist police radio location find- 
ing equipment within a radius of 
fifty miles. 

By the time the Major had 
half carried Dr. West to the top 
of the mountain range, the moon 
was rapidly descending toward 
the mountains of Sinkiang. The 
flat top of the ridge glittered 
the moon’s reflection. 

“Irrigation reservoir up here,” 
the Major gasped. “Look at the 



big pipes and hoses and pumps. 
Never knew the Chinks had it 
in ’em!” 

“That’s a high-voltage power 
line leading down into your un- 
inhabited canyon,” Dr. West 
said. 

“Doesn’t mean there’s Chinks 
down there. Never give up!” The 
Major led the way down the 
other side of the mountain. 

V 

'"T^hey fell down terraces, slosh- 
' through rice paddies, tripped 
over irrigation pipes, slid down 
endless terraces into the faint- 
ly humming canyon. This was 
how the Maoists had forced im- 
possible mountains to yield rice 
crops. At the bottom of the can- 
yon the power line led to an 
atomic generator plant. 

At the bottom of the canyon, 
the two men scrambled over an 
enormous concrete pipe. Dr. West 
heard the water rushing inside. 
With unlimited atomic-electric 
power the Chinese were piping 
water across vast distances. With 
an unlimited number of obedient 
hands, the Maoists had ordered 
terracing of mountains previous- 
ly considered “impossible for 
wet-rice cultivation.” 

Impossible these tiny rice pad- 
dies were for Chinese commune 
workers who needed 1,200 to 
1,800 calories of rice-energy per 



32 



GALAXY 




day. If Chinese tended these in- 
efficient vertical fields, they 
would need to eat the entire har- 
vest in order to survive and mul-. 
tiply. There would be no sur- 
plus. But Dr. West knew that 
these tiny paddies were hand- 
tended by beings who could not 
only survive, but dould labor 
from dawn to dark and multiply 
like rabbits on only 600 calories 
of rice-energy per day! 

As the Major led the way 
across the dark canyon, he 
stumbled over the sleeping body 
of the Maoist solution to the 
agricultural problem. 

“Don’t stangle him. Don’t 
kill him,” Dr. West hissed. “The 
man’s an Esk.” 

But the Major tightened his 
grip on the gurgling throat “Got 
to kill him. Would yell for help.” 

“He’s sure to be an Esk. I 
assume he’s descended from at 
least three generations of Maoist 
conditioning. I believe if I or- 
dered this Esk to go back to 
sleep, he would go back.” 

“You assume — you believe,” 
the Major panted angrily. “I 
know — he stinks like a Chink.” 
There was a vertebral crunch, 
and the body shuddered and 
quivered like a dying fish. “He 
was a Chink.” 

Dr. West did not try to ex- 
plain how he knew the man was 
an Esk merely by standing near 
him. It was a feeling. “A very 



useful trick,” Dr. George Brun- 
ing. Deputy Director of the 
C.I.A., had remarked. “You have 
a sixth sense there, Joe.” 

Dr. West followed the Major 
down the canyon alcmg the side 
of the roaring concrete pipe. 
Someone, perhaps a thousand 
miles away, turned a rheostatic 
switch which electro magnetical- 
ly opened giant valves, and the 
roar of irrigation water within 
the pipe increased. Ahead of 
Dr. West, the sky grew white 
with dawn. 

T he Major’s gaze darted fran- 
tically from side to side. He 
appeared to be seardiing for a 
place of concealment, but all the 
natural vegetation in the can- 
yon had been gathered, plucked, 
uprotted to feed the miserable 
cooking fires of the Esks. The 
two men threaded their way 
among sleeping lumps of cloth. 

Around dead fires, the faces 
of the sleeping Esks were ani- 
mated, twitching, smiling, bar- 
ing their teeth, seemingly more 
alive than when the Esks were 
conscious. 

Clutching his .45 as though 
it were his mother’s hand the 
Major tiptoed on, then looked 
back. It was evident he wanted 
to turn back. The further down 
the canyon they went, the more 
numerous the sleeping Esks. The 
brightening dawn illuminated the

33 




M^ijor’s frightened face. He kept 
glahdng up at the terraced 
imiountainsides for some place 
to hide. Yet he stubbornly con- 
tinued down the canyon. 

In the canyon, sleeping clumps 
of men, women, children lay — 
clustered together for warmth 
— all around the two quietly 
walking men. The Major’s hand 
closed on Dr. West’s shoulder, 
transmitting his shivering fear 
to the Doctor. ‘‘Tell me they’re 
Eskimos.” the Major breathed. 
“If they’re Chinese — ” 

“Chinese would be awake and 
screaming at us right now,” Dr. 
West whispered. “The Esks don’t 
pay much attention to us. Ob- 
serve, the Esks sleep intense- 
ly, as if they’re on another 
planet when they’re asleep. Look 
at that smiling face. We’ve tried 
truth drugs, but no human has 
been able to learn what dreams 
the Esks have. Awake, the Esks 
don’t know. It is as if the Esks 
lead two lives, concurrently yet 
separately. That is why the 
Chinese word for them is Dream 
Persons.” 

A buzzer sounded, resounded 
up and down the canyon. Blank- 
ly, the Esks stood up. There 
was none of the yawning and 
stretching, eye-rubbing and gig- 
gling, hawking and spitting 
which would have characterized 
real Arctic Eskimos or Chinese 
or Americans. The awakened 



faces of the Esks became ex- 
pressionless. The men and some 
of the women started climbing 
the steep trails among the rice 
terraces, their hoes already in 
their hands. Efficiently they did 
not urinate until they stood in 
the rice paddies. Up there on 
the terraces, the Esks began 
hoeing without breakfast. 

“What do we do now?” the 
Major whispered, still shivering 
as if he expected to be assailed 
by screaming Chinese with up- 
raised hoes. “Do you think 
they’ve sent someone off to tele- 
phone for the Chinese soldiers?” 
He pointed at an overhead wire. 

Dr. West smiled down at the 
Esk children crowding around 
them. When he smiled at them, 
their blank faces reflected his 
smile, lighting up with joy al- 
most like children’s faces any- 
where. 

Dr. West squatted down and 
tried to talk with them, using 
the Central Eskimo dialect he 
had learned in the Arctic. He 
tried introducing Cantonese 
words, then Mandarin Chinese. 
He looked up at the Major and 
shrugged and wearily smiled and 
shook his head. “These people 
— the Esks — have increased 
millions of times in numbers 
since I identified them in the 
Arctic ten years ago. Individual- 
ly, they — each generation — 
has deteriorated as to outward 



34 



GALAXY 




awareness. The original little 
group I studied in the Arctic 
were excellent imitators of the 
Eskimos. But these people, these 
children, they’re almost nonver- 
bal. They’re not imitating the 
Chinese. They’re not trying very 
hard to imitate anything hu- 
man.” 

A heavily pregnant woman 
prodded one of the circle of boys 
and made upward motions with 
her hands. Evidently the boy 
was big enough; he should be 
up there working on the rice 
terraces. He appeared to be 
about ten years old. 

‘‘That boy is about a year 
old,” the Doctor said. “The won- 
derful and terrible thing is that 
these people’s bodies mature so 
much more efficiently than ours. 
Their prenatal development is 
as perfectly straight forward as 
if God had had a plan — this 
time.” 

T^r. West became excited as 
he always did when he 
launched into the subject that 
had overwhelmed his life. “Why 
should our human fetuses take 
nine months to be born. Because 
of our evolutionary history on 
this planet, the growth of our 
embryos follows the old paths. 
Gills appear and are absorbed. 
An obsolete tail begins and dis- 
appears. Primitive appendages 
from our evolutionary past are 



recapitulated. This is our heri- 
tage from the billions of years 
of changing life forms on this 
Earth.” Dr. West hurled the 
bitter question no one could 
answer, “Now we are among 
people whose babies are bom in 
a month and mature in three 
years. That does not reflect the 
evolutionary history on this 
planet. Now tell me if the Esks 
are human?” 

“You murderer!” the Major 
hissed unexpectedly. “Finally 
I’ve figured out who you are. 
You genocidal maniac! You’ve 
^ot to be Dr. West. On the T.V. 
news, your escape, a couple of 
months ago. You narrow maniac, 
are you telling me the Eskimos 
aren’t human?” 

“These Esks aren’t. The Es- 
kimos are, if there are any real 
Eskimos still alive. Don’t tell 
me even a calloused military 
mind like yours has been soft- 
ened by the ‘Esks are Eskimos, 
love the Eskimos* campaign.” 

“You murdered hundreds of 
Eskimos. Look at these little 
children. We just sprayed ’em,” 
the Major bleated, as if it had 
been a death spray. 

The children scrambled about 
unconcernedly. A little girl 
clung to Dr. West’s leg. 

“Don’t tell me that little girl 
isn’t human,” the Major said. 
“She is human. Look at her lit- 
tle hands, ears, eyes.” 



OUR /AAN IN PEKING

“You were happier when you 
thought we were spraying Chi- 
nese children,” Dr. West re- 
torted. 

The Major made an abrupt 
move with his .45 and let his 
arm drop down hopelessly. 
“YouVe insane, criminally in- 
sane! Your were convicted of 
genocide and sent to a prison 
for the criminally insane. The 
Eskimos are the world’s hap- 
piest, most cooperative people.” 
“And you believe that mur- 
derers should be executed,” Dr. 
West challenged, hoping the 
Major would fire the gun, kill 
him, foul up all the intricate, 
unknown plans of the C.I.A. 

“These are people,” the Major 
pressed. “Call them Esks or Es- 
kimos, they’re just as human as 
we are. Right home at Edwards 
Air Force Base, whole crews of 
happy Eskimos are working at 
the base, more all the time. 
Wonderful, o>b'edient, happy peo- 
ple, and you teU me they’re not 
human.” 

44'^7"ou sound like a bleeding 
^ heart of a Maoist,” Dr. 
West retorted. “A rehash of the 
half-truths when I was cruxif- 
excoriated before the United Na- 
tions General Assembly. You’re 
remembering the Chinese Com- 
munist Party Line.” 

“You’re the traitor. Genocidal 
maniac is the truth,” the Major 

36 



added more calmly: “That 

whole U.S. Administration was 
voted out of office at the next 
election.” 

“A lot of voters believed the 
Communist Party line. It’s fun- 
ny now. My guilt rubbed off 
all over when only I made the 
decision. If you believe the Chi- 
nese fulminations of ten years 
ago, I made old Adolph Eich- 
mann look like an innocent saint. 
I was the threat to all the 
yellow skins and brown and 
black. I was the racial butcher.” 
“ . because the Eskimos 
weren’t bothering anybody.” The 
Major couldn’t keep his voice 
steady. “It wasn’t their fault 
that radio active cesium is con- 
centrated by the lichen-caribou 
food chain. The Eskimos always 
had eaten caribou. None of you 
wise-guy, know-it-all doctors told 
them not to — ” 

“The extreme mutational 
theory has no basis in fact. 
When will you stop confusing 
Eskimos with Esks?” 

“They’re the same. It’s a word 
trap, a phoney word trap to 
justify your plan for world gen- 
ocide of the Eskimos. The Eski- 
mos can’t help it if they’ve 
started multiplying fast.” 
“Major, you don’t know any- 
thing, except what you’ve recall- 
ed in bits and pieces from old 
T.V. newscasts of ten years 
ago when you had a mental age 



GALAXY 




of about ten and weren’t pay- 
ing much attention. How old 
do you think I was then? How 
old do I look now?” 

The Major^ blinked. ‘‘You’re 
damn well preserved — in prison 
you weren’t in the sun. In pris- 
on is where you’ll go if we ever 
get out of here. Right now I 
need you. You talk to these 
people. Tell them to hide us. 
Tell them we will free them 
from the Chinese. We’ll give 
them self-determination, food, 
real clothing, medical supplies 
if they’ll hide us from the 
Chinese.” 

“Oh, brotherl” Dr. West 
laughed savagely. “You are ter- 
rified! Why not promise them 
guns and ammunition?” 

“Sure, we’ll drop guns. Some 
of their people must be the 
guerrillas.” 

“Don’t you wish it were so?” 
Dr. West taunted. “These peo- 
ple aren’t Eskimos. These peo- 
ple aren’t human. These are 
Esks. Throw away your expec- 
tations of human behavior. Esks 
don’t behave that way. Do you 
see any Chinese guards? Hu- 
mans this miserable would need 
guards. Esks aren’t human. They 
don’t revolt. They feel no need 
to be guerrillas. Or to vote. They 
don’t need to. They’re getting 
their way. They’re getting what 
they want — or what something 
out there wants for them. 



They’re filling up our vrorld!” 

“Tell them to hide us. That’s 
an order.” 

“Very rapidly they’re filling 
our world.” 

“Tell them to hide us, damn 
you!” The Major’s .45 was 
raised again. 

“Where can they hide us? 
Under their ’ bodies?” 

“They must have houses some- 
place.” The Major peered about, 

Qhrugging, gesticulating, Dr. 
^ West tried to communicate 
with some of the women. “They 
say to climb over that ridge, 
that hill to the next valley,” 
he lied. “They say hide on the 
hill.” 

He regretted his lie as they 
struggled up the terraces. His 
mouth had lied before he had 
a chance to think. It was as if 
the Harvard Circle of the C.I.A. 
had drummed into his skull that 
he must go to a hilltop. The 
signal sender would have more 
range from a high place. Was 
that it? 

His heavy legs ached and 
dragged. His heart thudded. He 
was exhausted. He couldn’t make 
it all the way to the top of 
the mountain. It was a moun- 
tain of endless terraces, giant 
steps too big for any man. The 
world whirled dazzlingly bright 
as Dr. West fell in the mud. 

“You got to get up.” The Ma- 

37 



OUR /AAN IN PEKING 




jor was pulling at him. ‘‘Saw a 
copter out there. A little speck, 
zigging around like it’s look- 
ing for something. You don’t 
think the Chicomms are tuned 
in on our guerrilla wave length?” 
Dr. West started up at the 
muddy little signal sender in 
the Major’s huge hand. “Possi- 
ble.” That was the truth. In 
fact, it was the understatement 
of the year. The C.I.A. radio 
was tuned to the Maoist fre- 
quency. 

“How do I turn this thing off 
without busting it?” 

“Don’t turn it of^ Probably 
the helicopter is simply supervis- 
ing the Esks,” Dr. West’s mouth 
lied. “To turn it off, you break 
it. The signal sender will be 
broken, done for, and so will — ” 
“All right, let’s go, we can 
still reach the top.” The Major 
tried boosting him up the slip- 
pery wall of a terrace. “Got to 
reach the top. Irrigation pumps 
up there, I think. Can hide un- 
derneath. Won’t be seen from 
air.” The Major wheezed and 
gasped for breath, plainly feel- 
ing his forty-plus years and a 
candidate for a coronary. 

Dr. West fell again. “Leave 
me.” He had difficulty enunciat- 
ing the words. “I don’t want you 
to die for me.” 

“No, got to help you. In spite 
of everything we’re on the same 
side, Doc.” With strength and 



tenderness, the Majot helped Dr. 
West climb. “Some time — 
when you got time — you got 
to prove to me^ those Esks down 
there are different from: Eski- 
mos. I don’t believe it. I’ll nev- 
er believe it.” 

VI 

W hen the two men finally 
wormed under the throb- 
bing irrigation pump on the crest 
of the hill. Dr. West regained 
his breath and spoke intently 
through the roar of the pump. 
“If you could compare their 
chromosomes under the electron 
microscope, if you were a keen 
observer, you would see that 
their genetic coding, the DNA 
recipe which guides the growth 
of an Esk, in too neat, too per- 
fect, too repetitive among dif- 
ferent individuals to be — 
human.” 

Deaf to a maniac’s ravings, 
the Major peered out, clutching 
his .45 savagely as if it were 
an antiaircraft weapon. “The 
copter’s moving to a new posi- 
tion, like they’re — sure as hell 
— looking for something.” 

“The simplest misexplanation 
is yours, that the Esks are mu- 
tated Eskimos.” Dr. West con- 
tinued talking at cross-purposes 
to the Major. “Occam’s Razor, 
an old scientific rule of thumb, 
suggests if there are several pos- 



38 



GALAXY 




sible explanations for a mystery, 
pick the simplest. Mutated Es- 
kimos is the simplest explanation. 
It is the most conservative ex- 
planation. It is the explanation 
picked by so-called reputable 
physioligists. It is the explana- 
tion people want to continue to 
believe.” 

‘‘The copter^s moving out over 
the valley where we were — ” 
The Major stopped. 

The Doctor’s hand closed 
around the dagger within his 
layers of clothing, and he kept 
talking as though each sentence 
might be his last. “Mutations 
usually involve a single trait or 
related set of traits. But any 
honest study of the Esks shows 
they differ from human, beings 
in hundreds of ways, physiolo- 
gically and psychologically.” 

“The copter is moving from 
position to position like the 3 T*re 
trying to get a radio-location fix 
on us. Do you think this signal- 
sender — ” 

“And the Esk child acts hap- 
pier and more cooperative than 
a human child and efficiently 
grows into an adult in three 
years. Eating only six hundred 
calories of food a day, an adult 
Esk outworks a Chinaman. And 
breed, breed like lemmings I For 
what purpose are the Esks over- 
running the Earth? Why are 
the Chinese, we, everyone letting 
the Esks multiply?” 



“The copter’s heading in our 
direction.” 

“The simplest misexplanation 
is that the Chinese are using 
the Esks for politico-economic 
purposes. The Esks ease the Chi- 
nese agricultural problem. The 
Esks produce farm surpluses. 
The Esks produce a favorable 
balance of trade. The Esk man- 
power freed Chinese manpower 
to police India. But all this is 
the superficial explanation. It 
does not reveal the underly- 
ing — ” 

Copter straight for us!” The 
Major began smashing the signal 
sender with the butt of his .45. 

Dr. West could not stop talk- 
ing. He expected to be stilled 
for ever. “Even our President 
seems to believe the simple- 
headed explanation that the 
Chinese are using, breeding, the 
Esks as part of the endless war, 
simple power politics. But I be- 
lieve the Esks are using the 
Chinese!” 

T he clattering wail of the jet- 
copter chewed through the 
roar of the pump. 

Under the iron pump, as if 
cued by the soimds of the heli- 
copter, Dr. West’s hand pulled 
down the zipper, opening the Air 
Force blue nylon and freeing the 
quilted Chinese blue cotton with- 
in. 

The copter squatted down. It 

39 



OUR /AAN IN PEKING 




was small, with a plastic bubble 
cocl^i£ The Major stared from 
the two heads inside to his .45 
to Dr, West. 

As the copter engine squealed 
to a stop, the Major stared un- 
believing at Dr. West. ‘‘YouVe 
got on a coolie costume. All 
planned! Nothing for me. Good 
god, what was intended for me? 

Dr. West tried to release his 
own fingers from the dagger han 
die inside the padded Chinese 
coat. “I don’t know. I swear to 
you I don’t know.” 

iThe black boots of a Maoist 
policeman sprang from the cop 
ter to the Chinese mountain top 
and ran toward the pump. The 
Major rolled, firing his boom

ing, deafening .45 automatic 
three times. The Major’s wide- 
eyed face twisted back toward 
Dr. West, but the round eye 
of the .45 followed too slowly. 

With surgical precision, Dr. 
West’s hand thrust the dagger 
into the auricle of the Major’s 
heart. 

Dr. West, the man, sobbed. 

Helpless anguish lay within 
his body which he could not con- 
trol. A Chinese hand disengaged 
his fingers from the dagger. 

HT iu,” exclaimed the excited, 
young Cantonese voice 
above Dr. West’s body. ‘Where 
could he have gotten such a dag- 
ger? It is a Mark III dagger.” 



“My eyes can see it is a Mark 
III dagger,” the copter pilot re- 
torted. “This foreign devil may 
have killed an Inner Officer to 
get it. Or it was stolen; but these 
official daggers are numbered^ It 
is a true Mark III Dagger. The 
number on the blade — it is a 
low and important number!” 

“Liu, with care we should 
tread. Perhaps the Mark III dag- 
ger was issued to him.” The 
young Cantonese voice thick- 
ened. “Great care, and yet he is 
only wearing commune clothing, 
and he has the white corpse-face 
of a typical Big-Nose, and yet 
there is the radio signal to ex- 
plain. See, here is the little trans- 
mitter. The other Big-Nose must 
have smashed it. Extensive pho- 
tographs should be taken for the 
record or our buttocks may be 
burnt.” The black boots ran back 
to the copter. 

“Eh, yes, you — yes, YOU!” 
the copter pilot nudged Dr. West 
with his boot toe. “Did you un- 
derstand our words?” 

Dr. West feigned unconscious- 
ness. 

“He does. He understands us,” 
the copter pilot called. 

The younger man with the 
camera backed off, and the cop- 
ter pilot followed. Like doctors 
in consultation, in sinister whis- 
pers they argued. Then the 
young Maoist policeman ad- 
vanced warily toward the pa-

41 




Hent< is with great regret 
official regulations require 
u§ to fiihd your wrists to your 
ankles,” he blurted. “I, for one, 
would never do such a thing.” 
With professional expertise, he 
knotted the rope. 

The rope was not tight. The 
young Maoist policeman had 
been careful not to interfere with 
Dr. West’s circulation. Having 
already tied him so he could not 
walk, the two men had to hoist 
Dr. West and carry him to the 
helicopter. 

‘Tor a thin man — very 
heavy!” the young one gasped. 

“Big bones. Primitive skeleton. 
Typical Big-Nose,” the pilot re- 
torted. 

“Did you notice the wrists of 
the dead one are hairy as an 
apes!” The young voice echoed 
the racial disgust. “Weak, blue 
eyes. Shot at me twice.” 

“Three times. So close to your 
belly even a drunken sot Im- 
perialist should not miss. Either 
you are dead or there was some- 
thing wrong with his bullets.” 

As the helicopter scuttled up- 
ward, it side-slipped violently. 
Its door flew open. The sack in 
which the Maoist policeman had 
collected the battered signal send- 
er, the dagger, Dr. West’s C.I.A. 
“escape kit” and the .45 slid 
across the dented aluminum floor, 
disgorging its contents. The 
young p>oliceman fell to his knees, 

42 



snatching at these sliding objects. 
The copter lurched upward, 
slamming the door shut, and the 
Major’s head flopped against Dr. 
West’s boimd foot and wrist. 
The Major’s blue eyes were 
white rimmed in death. 

Dr. West closed his own eyes. 
Whiplashes of self-flagdlation 
slashed through the numbness in- 
side his skull. 

J cai^i rationalize that those 
master minds in Harvard Cir^ 
cle killed him. When he turned 
the muzzle of the .45 tne, all 
my vainglorious hopes that he 
would kill me turned intq lies. 
Instinctively I dodged from the 
nothingness oi death. My mind 
and body joined in thrusting the 
dagger with all my strength as if 
he were an enemy. God help my 
friends! My hand would have 
killed him even if I had been 
free from narcohypnosis, and I 
may have been free. 

The copter tilted. Dr. West 
stared down at the truncated 
mountain peaks. The guys in the 
Harvard Circle should be happy 
now. The Chinese have me. Tiny 
reservoirs, thin pipelines, in every 
direction the Chinese world was 
terraced and glittering with mi- 
croscopic rice paddies. Ten years 
ago these had been 'barren moun- 
tains, but now the myriad, multi- 
plying hands of the E^ks were 
dhhngihg the world. 



GAUXY 




Ten years ago in the Arctic, I 
thought I was free to act like 
God. I thought I realized the im- 
plications of the group of Eski- 
mos on the Boothia Peninsula, 
who suddenly and mysteriously 
had outgrown their food supply. 
The Canadian Government be- 
gan parachuting additional Fam- 
ily Allowance to them. More and 
more planes, more and more food 
drops begat more and more 
**Eskimos.^* The authorities in Ot- 
tawa labelled my on-the-spot es- 
timate of the birth rate impossi- 
ble. 

When I went on to Washing- 
ton and tried to report the even 
more sinister evidence I had col- 
lected as to the origin of the 
Esks and finally asserted they 
were not Eskimos, the official re- 
action was ^*Oh, you^re Dr. West 
who was fired from some popul- 
ation study at the University of 
California. No wonder you were 
fired; you^re — uh — obviously 
emotionally disturbed.’^* 

By the next summer the 
damned fools in Ottowa and 
Waslungton were sending ice- 
breakers towing whole barge 
loads of food. **Human life is 
sacre(T\ they said. **No one must 
starve^\ 

There were plans to relocate 
the surplus Eskimos, distributing 
them throughout the North. By 
now Canadian Government of- 
ficials admitted that the birth 



rate of the Boothia Eskimos^ was 
‘"startling”; but they said “we 
can hardly drown the little beg- 
gars just because their mothers re- 
fuse to swallow birth-control 
pills.” 

With a bush planeload of lug- 
gage, I flew back to the Boothia 
Peninsula before the food barges 
could get through the shore ice. 
Heaving made my decision, I felt 
a tremendous freedom to act. 
Gambling with people^s lives is 
everyday work for doctors. At 
that time the staphyloccocus 
strains which specifically infect 
the Fallopian tubes and spermatic 
ducts had not been fully tested 
on a broad sample of human be- 
ings. 

^"T^he Jime sun melted the snow- 
banks. The insects and birds 
appeared, and the Eskimos gath- 
ered to await the unloading of 
the barges. Laughing and frolick- 
ing, the Eskimos played with the 
aerosol cans labelled mosquito 
spray, which Dr. West was 
handing out to them. 

Of the two thousand Eskimos, 
the largest concentration of Eski- 
mos the North had ever seen, less 
than one hundred showed any 
symptoms of infection. The other 
1,900 turned out to be Esks. The 
Esks turned out to be immune 
to the ordinary human infections. 
Of the hundred real Eskimos, 
twenty-two died. They should 

43 



OUR AAAN IN PEKING 




not have died, but they died from 
this minor staphylococcus infec- 
tion. 

The hunt lyas on. There I 
stood. The tragedy became much 
greater than my Hie or death or 
the death of the twenty -two 
Eskimos, It was my trial for at- 
tempted genocide that brought 
the attention of the world upon 
the plight of the rapidly increas- 
ing 'Esks. The Swedes and Rus- 
sians sent food. 

In the United Nations General 
Assembly the oriental bloc seized 
upon my guilt and made it the 
guilt of Canada ^and the United 
States. The Chinese and other 
nations sent massive aid, and the 
evacuation of surplus Eskimos to 
any country willing to accept 
them and pay the transportation 
costs began. The Esks spread — 

That is my crucial guilt, that 
my actions aided the spread of 
Esks. I should have ended my- 
self then. I would not have lived 
to see a billion Esks in China 
alone! 

The helicopter veered, and far 
below was exposed the gray over- 
cast that shrouds any modern 
city. The copter pilot chattered 
through his radio to the ground. 

Baring his teeth, Dr. West lung- 
ed at the door of the helicopter. 
As his skull rammed the door 
outward, his eyes glimpsed noth- 
ingness. 

Surprisingly strong hands 

44 



dragged his head and shoulders 
back into the helicopter. 

“Liu, this one would have 
fallen to his ancestors — but he 
paused.^' 

VII 

^T^he blades of the helicopter 
' whirled through the thicken- 
ing smog. The continuous squeal- 
ing agony of its jet engine lower- 
ed. With a bounce that slammed 
Dr. West's face against the floor, 
the copter landed ; and the Maoist 
policeman kicked the door open. 

“You're my responsibility no 
more," the young policeman 
laughed with relief, and Dr. West 
was dragged out of the copter by 
noisy, black-uniformed, young 
Chinese. “The Interrogator must 
think this Big-Nose is a big fish," 
a girl's voice excitedly laughed. 
Another voice asked: “Has prop- 
er caution been taken to tele- 
phone Peking, Capital of the 
World — Praise be to Mao III.” 
A second girl's voice laughed : 
“Liu, you handsome pilot, where 
are you studying tonight?" 

An inhaling gasp quieted the 
black-uniformed crowd on the 
heli-roof of the massive concrete 
police headquarters. 

“Has no protection been taken 
against infection? You are all 
quarantined! Orderly, place the 
assassin on the cart. No, don’t 
wheel him this way. Take him 

GALAXY 




down through the freight eleva- 
tor.” 

Dr. West was to recognize this 
cold voice again after he had 
been stripped, sprayed, fumigated 
and pricked for a blood sample. 
He lay on a cold operating table. 

“Cover him with a sheet.” It 
was the voice of the Interrogator. 

The ceiling was enamelled 
white. 

“Make him comfortable with a 
2 c.c. injection.” 

Dr. West began to relax. He 
felt warmer. The effect was simi- 
lar to a narcotic the Harvard Cir- 
cle had administered. 

“You will be interested to know 
that a large proportion of the 
working people in the United 
States and the intellectuafs and 
the medical people, such as your- 
self, as you no doubt know, are in 
sympathy with the peace-loving 
aims of the Chinese Federation 
of Nations. When I say interested 
I mean you will be interested to 
know that we already had been 
notified of your war-mongering 
flight by many highly placed 
sources in the United States. The 
exact flight plan of your intruding 
aircraft was known to us, and 
proper authorities had been noti- 
fied, and of course your obsolete 
aircraft was tracked by our radar 
and our excellent interceptors, 
which could have shot it down at 
any time had such an order been 
given.” 

OUR /AAN IN PEKING 



Dr. West listened to the in- 
tense voice but had difficulty fol- 
lowing its meanings. 

“You will be interested to know 
that in a few hours our excellent 
medical technicians will have 
positively identified the aerosol 
spray which descended from your 
aircraft, and no doubt they al- 
ready have several cures for it. 
You need not fear symptoms 
from your own exposure to the 
spray. We will innoculate you 
against its effects. To confirm our 
already excellent diagnosis, please 
tell us what nonfiltrable virus is 
involved?” 

D r. West awakened slightly. 

He had assumed, guessed, 
that a bacterial agent of the 
staph-strep group had been used. 
This bacterium should be easily 
recognizable by culturing and 
microscopic inspection. Why was 
the Interrogator talking about a 
nonfiltrable virus? Pathologists 
and technicians tend to blame 
a nonfiltrable virus when 
NOTHING can be found. 

“What virus were you forced 
to spray against your will upon 
helpless women and children. 
Each word you speak will save 
the life of a child.” 

Dr. West knew that the only 
effective resistance when under- 
going interrogation is to say 
nothing. As in a psychological 
test, anything you say, lie or 

45 




truth, will be filed and cross- 
filed, so that the more you lie, 
the more clearly the watery rings 
of truth will rise through the pool 
of lies. 

Dr. West tried to say nothing. 

But his mouth opened. As his 
mouth began to speak, Dr. West 
realized that this would not be a 
dialogue between himself and the 
Interrogator. Three points of view 
were present. The third was 
speaking from his mouth now. 
The Harvard Circle had entered 
the interrogation room — in spir- 
it, a damn treacherous spirit! 

*T am Dr. Joseph West,’^ his 
mouth announced. ‘‘Ten years 
ago I attempted to exterminate 
the Eskimos.” What was the Har- 
vard Circle trying to do to him? 

“We are aware of who you 
are.” Then the Interrogator whis- 
pered something aside to some- 
one else. “Answer our questions 
please*' the Interrogator contin- 
ued. “Do not volunteer extraneous 
information. We know everything 
already. Answer our questions 
quickly," the Interrogator’s voice 
rose. “What is the viral agent?” 

“I am Dr. West,” his mouth re- 
peated. “Dr. Joseph West. This 
can be easily checked. No doubt 
there are photographs of me in 
your news archives. Dr. Joseph 
West — I was convicted of Eski- 
mo genocide. I am acknowledged 
to be the greatest expert on the 
Esks, Eskimos, Dream Persons 

46 



as you term them. During my 
years in prison I was allowed to 
continue my research.” 

This last was a lie. Dr. West 
had vegetated in prison. 

“Answer the question! What is 
the virus?” The Interrogator 
sounded nervous. “What’s the 
virus?”. 

Dr. West stared at the ceiling 
grill. Something had winked, re- 
flected light, a glass lens behind 
the grill. No doubt they were film- 
ing and recording. 

He tried to move his arm, but 
it was strapped, and something 
was pressing into his wrist. No 
doubt his pulse and perspiration 
reactions were being taped. 

The Harvard Circle really 
might have notified Chinese 
Communist agents in the United 
States that his aircraft was com- 
ing over! 

“Your Mark III dagger is a 
forgery! Your pulse becomes ab- 
normally fast,” the Interrogator’s 
voice said. “You feel guilt and 
fear — but be assured we will do 
nothing to harm you. We 
bow down before the immortal 
thoughts of our Grandfather 
Mao : ‘All men should be treated 
both with justice and mercy.^ 
Therefore feel free to tell us the 
virus!” 

TTI^hat had speeded Dr. West’s 
^ ^ pulse rate was rage! Those 
C.I.A. spooks callously had pre- 

GALAXY 




pared him to murder the Major 
as one minor maneuver. The 
spraying, the ejection, the dagger, 
the signal sender, the stabbing — 
all were intended to increase Dr. 
West’s chances of being taken 
alive by the Maoist Police. All 
were intended to give him an aura 
of importance. 

‘‘I am Dr. Joseph West,” his 
mouth repeated with sickening 
fatuousness. 

“Damn it!” Dr. West shouted. 
“How the hell do I know what 

I 

was in that spray. They let me 
think it was a bacterial agent to 
sterilize the Esks, to demonstrate 
to you that selective sterilization 
of the Esks is possible. And it is 
possible!” 

“Good, we are glad to hear 
that you will cooperate. In t3rpi- 
cal fashion, your Central Intelli- 
gency Agency has tricked you. 
What virus do you think the spray 
contained?” 

“Virus? How the hell should I 
know? I doubt if it is a virus, but 
I’ll give you three guesses. One, 
a virus with a long incubation 
period. In about 21 days the Esks 
will undergo interesting changes. 
Personality reversal. Cute. Chang- 
ed into what they really are. 
They’ll tear you apart.” Dr. West 
gasped for breath, unsure whether 
he or the Harvard Circle was ly- 
ing now. 

“Number two,” he laughed. 
“The spray could consist of dis- 

OUR MAN IN PEKING 



tilled water. No wonder your 
medical personnel are baffled. 
But don’t let it baffle you. It 
means the spray run was a decoy. 
The C.I.A. wanted to use an Air 
Force plane to attract your at- 
tention to something or distract 
your attention from something. 
The State Department in Wash- 
ington did not want the C.I.A. 
Warhawks to use a real bacterial 
spray that would force you to- 
ward retaliation. So, distilled 
water? Does that make Peking 
feel safer? 

“Number three,” Dr. West 
laughed in confusion. “This is 
the possibility to worry you to- 
night. You’'H never sweat it out 
of me because I don’t know what 
it is, except to say that the men 
in the Harvard Circle get up very 
very early in the morning, and 
when they go to this much trou- 
ble to deliver a man to China, 
they must have one hell of a rea- 
son.” 

rr^he Interrogator made a sad 
' ^ sighing sound. “Please, but 
you must tell us the truth. Dr. 
West. You are a brilliant man, a 
scientist who searches for Truth. 
Ten years ago when you made 
your free decision to eliminate 
the Dream Persons, you acted 
upon it freely because you believ- 
ed it was the Truth. In China you 
would never have been con- 
sidered a criminal because you 

47 




believed in Truth. You could — 
you still can live here freely to 
work and study. In the Chinese 
Federation of Nations we give 
honor and assistance to all search- 
ers after Truth. As our Grand- 
father Mao once said: (May a 
thousand blossoms bloom, a 
thousand schools of thought con- 
tend.) Only in China are you 
free to speak the truth. What 
virus did your Central Intelli- 
gence Agency force you to spray 
upon the peace-loving peoples of 
the world 

This soothing flow of words 
continued until Dr. West began 
to drowse. He was physically 
exhausted. The third party to 
the trilogue, the Harvard Circle, 
refused to feed new answers into 
his mouth. 

It was as if the start of the in- 
terrogation had cued from his 
skull his oral self-identification as 
I)r. Joseph West, famous geno- 
cide, expert on Esks. Now the 
Harvard Circle wanted to say no 
more at this time. Or he had for- 
gotten what he was supposed — 

‘‘You can sleep as soon as you 
tell all about the virus. Dr. West.” 
The Interrogator resorted to 
flashing lights and buzzers and, 
after an indeterminate period of 
time, to small electric shocks. 

Once or twice Dr. West tried 
to argue, vaguely aware that his 
voice was incoherent. Suddenly he 
screamed; his breath squawled! 

48 



God, what were they doing to 
him? 

“Message for Mao III” he 
heard his voice squawk. Torture 
had cued the next communication 
from the Harvard Circle. 

“I must be taken to Mao III,” 
his hoarse voice repeated over 
and over. No matter what they 
did to him, try as he could, he 
was unable to tell the Interroga- 
tor what the message was. “Stop 
them, stop them. I don’t know.” 

“Of course we cannot actually 
take him to our beloved Chair- 
man,” the Interrogator’s voice 
agreed with someone equally in- 
visible. “Apologies that so much 
time has been spent; a little more 
time will be needed; electrocranial 
acupuncture is required if we are 
to free the core of truth in this 
man. It seems that rigid block- 
ades have been placed in his 
memory, perhaps hypnotically.” 

Oblivion. 

^'T^here were black silk slippers 
' on his bare feet. He lay in a 
different room. He was wearing 
a coarse gray cloth uniform. His 
head ached. When he raised his 
fingers to his head, he found his 
hair had been shaved off and 
there were a number of bumps, 
little knobs, on his scalp. He could 
find no evidence of torture on his 
body. His legs ached and appear- 
ed swollen, but this probably was 
due to . he knew but couldn’t 

GALAXY 




remember What had caused his 
swollen legs. Perhaps the unac- 
customed exercise of strug^ing 
up and down mountain rice-ter- 
races? 

An intense-faced Chinese hur- 
ried into the white room. The 
man inhaled, standing very 
straight in his gleaming, black 
silk robe, which was the historical 
Chinese costume Maoist officials 
had reassumed in recent years. 
Dr. West recalled that the color 
black symbolized virtue, and the 
embroidered dragons, good luck 
and power. Coarse blue cotton 
uniforms were for the troops. 

‘‘Time is flowing past.” The 
man added with a typical interro- 
gator’s ploy: “Everything is 

known.” 

In recognition of that intense 
voice. Dr. West’s body winced, 
and it was with a drying mouth 
that he tried to answer back like 
a punished adolescent. “If you 
know everything — you are too 
prescient to be the — Interroga- 
tor. You should be God or Mao 
III.” 

“That is a sacrilegious state- 
ment to your god and to Mao 
III, who sits in judgment here at 
the center of the world.” 

“Then I have been flown to 
Peking?” 

“You have been disinfected 
both externally and internally,” 
the Interrogator replied. “You 
have the honor . .” 

OUR MAN IN PEKING 



But a man in a thick, leaden 
apron with goggles on his fore- 
head resembling a second set of 
eyes interrupted. “Ah, — we need 
him for an hour now.” 

Dr. West recognized the man’s 
profession as X-ray specialist. 
Very funny. Did they intend to 
X ray his internal organs for 
bombs? 

“Later! It is too late. The time 
has been set.” In the Interroga- 
tor’s voice there was irritation and 
strain, and he turned back to Dr. 
West and managed a conspira- 
torial smile. 

“You are the first foreigner in 
three years to be so honored. This 
you will remember and cherish. 
You can drink your tea later.” 

“Ta-tung!” the Interrogator 
shouted : 

“The eastern sky reddens. 

The sun rises 

And in China the line of 
Maos has come! 

They strive for the welfare 
of the people. 

They are the great saviours 
of the people!” 

Two men dressed in black silk 
who appeared to be minor offi- 
cials trundled in on a low vehicle 
with four padded seats. Dr. West 
thought it resembled an electric 
cart for a golf foursome. The 
golf cart was followed by half 
a dozen bored soldiers. They 
stood scratching inside their 
padded blue uniforms while the 

49 




two men in black bowed imen- 
thusiastically toward the Interro- 
gator. ‘‘Ready? We only have the 
office for ten minutes.” 

“He can understand everything 
you say,” the Interrogator 
snapped. 

One official glanced at his 
wristwatch, then wearily rolled 
his gaze to the ceiling. “You 
should have notified me of that 
fact in writing.” 

It was plain that the Interroga- 
tor had much less influence here 
in Peking. 

VIII 

« 

A s the electric cart trundled 
along endless concrete corri- 
dors, the soldiers lagged further 
and further behind; and Dr. West 
realized the building must cover 
acres of ground, a veritable Pen- 
tagon. 

Even seated in the cart, he was 
in pain from his swollen legs. 
The electric cart whirred on and 
on. His head felt as if a fist were 
tightening inside. Apparently the 
Interrogator’s electric needles 
had failed to discharge any 
messages to Mao III. The Har- 
vard Circle must have planned 
one sight, one reaction which 
would cue a synapse in the re- 
cesses of his brain, releasing the 
message to his conscious mind. 
It seemed obvious whom he was 
being taken to see, face to face. 

50 



His pulse was racing as if his 
body expected to be cued to vio- 
lent action. If there was a message 
in his? skull. Dr. West thought it 
must be a dandy to justify the 
maneuvers of the Harvard Circle. 

Again, he remembered the blue 
eyes of the Major widening. Good 
God, the Major’s voice cried. 
What was intended for me? 

Dr. West began to shiver un- 
controllably. He wanted to jump 
off the cart. The smiling faces 
closed in on him : Dr. George 
Bruning, Deputy Director of 
the C.I.A.; Dr. Sammy Wjmo- 
ski, chemophychiatrist; Dr. Fred 
Gatson, bacteriologist; Dr. Einar 
Johansen, neurosurgeon. But 
there had been another member 
of the Harvard Circle. • 

Tom Randolph, a narrow-eyed 
man who chain-smoked cigarettes 
as if he had a death wish, had be- 
come a full professor of para- 
psychology at Duke University 
at age twenty-six. In the base- 
ment of C.I.A. headquarters. Dr. 
West had recognized Tom’s off- 
kilter face. While Joe West had 
been a graduate medical student 
at Harvard, Tom Randolph had 
been the undergrad, who led the 
protest march which culminated 
in the dynamiting of the Quad. 

The crazy kid should have 
ended in jail instead of as a Ph.D 
with his hands on millions of dol- 
lars of Defense Department 
money for extra sensory research. 

GALAXY 




Surprisingly, Tom Randolph had 
resigned to take a seemingly less 
important position. Thisi was with 
the Central Intelligence Agency 
when the President of the United 
States appointed fdlow Harvard 
ynan George Bruning as Deputy 
Director. 

To Dr. West, the memory of 
Tom Randolph’s narrow eyes in- 
specting him as if he were as ex- 
pendable as a bomb was terri- 
fying. 

“Mao III has a faith -healer,” 
Tom Randolph’s voice had rasp- 
ed. “Remember, Joe, when we 
were young wise-guys at Har- 
vard and you scared hell out 
of me at a drinking party. That’s 
what turned me on extra-sensory 
research.” 

D r. Joe West felt claustropho- 
bia even tighter than when 
he was trapped in the aircraft 
capsule, and he tried to climb off 
the electric cart. 

But they were too strong for 
him. The carved dragon doors 
opened, and the dwarfed man be- 
hind the huge desk glanced up. 
He wore a simple, agricultural 
commune costume. 

“You are not Mao III,” Dr. 
West’s mouth immediately an- 
nounced. “You are a double.” 
The man blinked and glanced 
at the Interrogator’s shocked 
face. The Interrogator whirled, 
screaming at Dr. West that he 
OUR /AAN IN PEKING 



was insulting the Chairman of 
the World, the Father of the Chi- 
nese Federation of Nations. 

For a moment Dr. West ex- 
perienced the weird feeling that 
he had been about to explode. 
The faces of the Harvard Circle, 
electric eels, Bio-Power, heavy * 
legs, for those sons of bitches a 
bomb that walked like a man and 
was cued when he saw Mao III — 
Another official appeared from 
a side door. “Quiet please. Clear 
the room. Your scheduled time is 
over. The room is needed.” 

The man behind the desk rose 
obediently and departed. 

Even before the Interrogator 
was able to stop screaming, a 
third official appeared with 
soldiers. “Lieutenant, investigate 
' this foreign prisoner’s document- 
locator number. Update his Spar- 
row Folder and file in Pending.” 
Some afternoons Dr. West was 
taken from his cell to a waiting 
room. Through tiie swinging door 
to the main waiting room he 
glimpsed nervous men in In- 
donesian garb with briefcases and 
weary men in western suits who 
sat on benches day after day. 
Sometimes he recognized the 
Australian Premier. When jani- 
tors began sweeping the floor, 
the men with briefcases would file 
out and Dr. West would be taken 
back to his cell. 

Once a Lieutenant peered 
through the bars: “Ah, I hoped 

51 




I’d locate you eventually. Ac- 
ccMTding to records transferred 
ftotxs, Szediuan Province, the 21- 
day incubation period for un- 
known infectious disease is over. 
Now you can be shot.” 

>^ne sleeping period he was 
awakened, and a barber 
shaved him. Dr. West protested. 

“This is the wrong time to go 
to the waiting room.” After a 
month in the cell block, Dr. West 
tended to become irritable when- 
ever the freedom of normal rou- 
tine was disturbed. 

An electric cart transported 
him to his waiting room and to 
his surprise into the main waiting 
room where the janitors were 
emptying the ash trays and on 
into the empty office with the 
large desk where he had last seen 
the Interrogator and on along a 
hall into a large-roomed apart- 
ment which was dim because the 
man was watching television. 

At the end of the news pro- 
gram, the man switched off the 
T.V. set by remote control. “Is 
this Dr. Joseph West?” 

“Yes, Chairman. His file has 
been placed on the tea table at 
your left hand.” 

“Some years ago when I still 
believed there was a purpose to 
be served by personally making 
speeches, I announced to the 
world that I wanted to meet you 
eye to eye. Dr. West. The impli- 

52 



cation then was that I would 
righteously tear you limb from 
limb. The occasion was my ad- 
dress to the United Nations Gen- 
eral Assembly on the subject of 
the attempted genocide of the 
Eskimos by you and persons un- 
known, such as the United States 
government.” 

Dr. West made no attempt to 
answer. No message to Mao III 
from the Harvard Circle emerged 
from his mouth, but now Dr. 
George Bruning^s voice was echo- 
ing in his memory: “Listen and 
observe, when Mao III or any 
man speaks of his strengths and 
beliefs; soon his contradictions 
and weaknesses will stick out like 
handles by which you can seize 
him.” 

Mao III stirred clumsily in his 
padded chair. Dr. West saw that 
Mao HI was not wearing a sim- 
ple commune costume. He was 
engulfed in an ornate black silk 
robe embroidered with a tra- 
ditional dragon. 

“Tonight while I was watching 
television coverage of the latest 
C.I.A. intruder aircraft to crash, 
I was reminded of an intelligence 
brief on my desk some months 
ago. This extrapolated a mini- 
mum of facts into a theory that a 
Dr. West had been delivered to 
China because I once had ex- 
pressed a desire to meet him. 
This amused me at the .time. It 
would be better for your Presi- 

GALAXY 




dent to communicate with me di- 
rectly. I am a busy man and can- 
not deal with minor interme- 
diaries.” 

Dr. West observed the awk- 
ward position of Mao Ill’s right 
wrist and left leg. Although Mao 
III was a comparatively young 
man, evidently he had suffered a 
paralytic stroke. Probably about 
three years ago when he vanished 
from the public eye. 

‘‘The intruder aircraft which 
crashed tonight was a con- 
verted passenger transport paint- 
ed black,” Mao III continued in 
his precise voice. “It contained 
an estimated 120 Eskimos, con- 
fined in a dozen large parachute 
ejection capsules. After the crash, 
the capsules saved many of the 
corpses from burning.” 

D r. West straightened mentally, 
glimpsing the unknowable 
faces of the Harvard Circle. What 
was going on? 120 Eskimos mur-' 
dered. 

Mao III was saying: . were 

to be parachuted into the moun- 
tainous region of Szechuan Pro- 
vince where our Dream Persons 
now comprise more than 90% of 
the population. The bodies of 
these Eskimos, or American 
Dream Persons, were dressed in 
commune costumes. They were 
equipped with machine pistols, 
plastic explosives, miniature ra- 
dios and related equipment as if 

OUR MAN IN PEKING 



the C.I.A. intended that they or- 
ganize guerrilla warfare. As my 
grandfaither, Mao Tise-taig, often 
said: ‘The guerrilla is the fish 
who swims among the people.’ 
But to swim among our Dream 
Persons would be more frustrat- 
ing.” 

Mao III laughed as if he liked 
to hear his own voice. “Times 
have changed since my grand- 
father was Chairman. He had no 
Dream Persons to perplex him. 
Surely you C.I.A. assassins do 
not really believe that American 
Eskimos or even a more sentient 
strain of American Dream Per- 
sons could arouse our Dream 
Persons.” 

This was a statement rather 
than a question. Like other lead- 
ers, Mao III had swept into a 
monologue. “It is not psycholo- 
gically possible for Dream Per- 
sons to take the aggressive initi- 
ative necessary for revolution. 
Your Eskimos cannot arouse our 
Dream Persons because there is 
nothing to arouse. If your heavily 
armed corpses are not Eskimos, 
if they are American Dream Per- 
sons the joke is even stranger. 
This is like sending the blind to 
teach the blind how to see.” 

Dr. West felt physically ill, 
suspecting the black aircraft had 
been purposely crashed by the 
Harvard Circle. The planeload of 
Esks might be simply to remind 
the Chinese that the C.I.A’s Esk 

53 




expert was filed away somewhere 
in a Peking prison. Had those 
Harvard know-it-alls murdered 
120 Esks as another little move 
in the attempt to place an 
American face to face with Mao 
III? 

. Marxist-Maoists are anti- 
Malthusian/^ Mao III was say- 
ing, ‘‘because we have faith in 
mankind’s ability to find new 
food supplies, new living space 
beneath the sea, new planets. 
There cannot be too many Chi- 
nese when there is so much work 
to be done. For the present, there 
cannot be too many Dream Per- 
sons. It is strange that the C.I.A. 
would send you to China. From 
the beginning you have had a 



closed mind concerning the Esks. 
Dr. West, what rational message 
could you possibly bring?” 

D r. West stood there swaying. 

He did not know. If the Har- 
vard Circle had given him a 
message for Mao III, it was lost 
or buried too deep in his skull. 
He stood face to face with Mao 
III, and no message had been 
cued. 

. Marxist-Maoist position 
regarding the origin of the Dream 
Person,” Mao III was orating “is 
that the renewed thermonuclear 
testing by Russia in the Arctic 
during the 197 O’s caused the mu- 
tation. No other nation would 
have both the vicious deviationist 




54 



GALAXY 



disregard for hum^ 1^; tte 
technological clum^esVI^ 
plode weapons so uhe^^cteffly 
filthy with radioactive cesium.” 



This cued the one-track in Dr. 
West’s mind. “The mutation 
theory has no basis in fa — ” 
“The lichens, the little plants 
on Arctic rocks, were contaminat- 
ed with radioactive cesium,” Mao 
Ill’s voice swept on emotionally, 
drowning Dr. West’s voice. “The 
lichens were like rice to the herds 
of caribou, and radioactive cesium 
concentrated in certain organs of 
these extinct beasts who were 
eaten by the Eskimos, who are 
an Oriental People. Don’t tell me 
there was no mutation!” 

Mao III gasped for breath, evi- 



dently emotionally involved with 
his interpretation of the Esks. 
“The most important mutation 
in the world took place on the 
Boothia Peninsula in the Cana- 
dian Northwest Territories. An 
oriental child was born.” 

“Even though there were not 
Three Wise Men in attendance, 
even though no angels sang/' 
Mao III laughed breathlessly, 
“the metabolism of this child wan 
at least three times as efficient, 
and he matured in one fifth as 
many years as other children. 
Whenever this precocious Eski- 
mo mated, from each conception 
to the time of birth was only a 
month.” 

Near Mao Ill’s ri^t hand 




OUR MAN IN PEKING 



55 






gleamed a glass of water. He look- 
ed at it longingly. ‘‘The rapid 
multiplication of these Dream 
Persons has proved vital to the 
ri^tful growth of the Chinese 
Federation of Nations. My origi- 
nal decision to rescue the Eski- 
mos from imperialist genocide has 
been proven correct.” 

Mao Ill’s right hand jerked, 
and he stared at Dr. West. “I re- 
call from the United Nations dis- 
cussions of ten years ago, your 
own theory of the origin of that 
first Dream Person was more un- 
likely and — sinister. 

“I was the first; I was en- 
camped on the Boothia Peninsu- 
la within five years after the 
event took place.” Dr. West spoke 
quickly. “I interviewed the Eski- 
mos who — ” 

“There is no need for you to de- 
fend your theory,” Mao III in- 
terrupted. “You have attempted 
to justify your mass murder on 
many occasions. I, for one, would 
be equally disturbed if I believed 
your theory.” 

A Tao Ill’s right hand made a 
tentative movement toward 
the glass of water. “At the pres- 
ent time it is to the advantage 
of the Chinese Federation of Na- 
tions to breed several billion more 
Dream Persons at the very least.” 
“And drown the world!” 

“Are you worried about the dis- 
appearance of hairy, Anglo-Saxon 

56 



man? Because the Dream Per- 
son’s traits invariably are domi- 
nant?” Mao III laughed. “Per- 
haps the world would be a hap- 
pier and more peaceful place if 
all peoples were absorbed by the 
Dream Persons? Are you sure 
there is not already a political 
. splinter group in the United 
States which has decided I am a 
Dream Person, a degenerate Eski- 
mo? It is not true. Dream Per- 
sons are remarkably unqualified 
for the violent leadership that is 
necessary in the world today.” 

Awkwardly, Mao Ill’s para- 
lyzed right hand attempted to 
reach the glass. “The Chinese 
people and all the peace-loving 
peoples of the world know that 
the vicious racist American prop- 
aganda campaign is to delude 
the Chinese Federation of Na- 
tions into giving up our greatest 
source of economic growth, the 
Dream Persons!” 

Dr. West watched the shiver- 
ing hand. Instinctively, because 
he was a fellow human being his 
eyes wanted Mao Ill’s hand to be 
able to reach, to grasp the glass 
of water. 

“Ah!” Mao III proudly clutch- 
ed the glass in his hand. Shudder- 
ing, he raised it to his lips. 

When he had finished, an at- 
tendant stepped from the shadows 
to take the glass. “No, no,” Mao 
III cough^, “This time, this 
time I will not drop it.” 



GALAXY 




Dr. West’s eyes concentrated 
on the cautiously moving hand 
on its long journey with the 
empty glass down toward the ta- 
ble. The glass clunked on the 
table. 

‘‘Ah! You see I am making 
great improvement. Until tonight 
I always broke the glass. I- am 
informed you originally were a 
medical doctor who attempted to 
save Hves rather than destroy 
them? If so, you will understand 
the importance in my condition 
of such a sudden improvement. 
It was as if a voice in my head 
was telling my hand to move 
downward. Amazingly, my hand 
obeyed. No doubt new nerve wires 
have been growing as my doctors 
promised, growing past the dead 
spot in my brain, and tonight con- 
tact is made! Look at this. I am 
going to raise my arm. Soon, you 
will see, soon I will stand before 
the people again. I will astound 
the world with my words. This is 
the greatest moment in history 
of the world!” 

IX 

XT^hile Dr. West’s eyes watch- 
ed, Mao III tried to stand 
up. 

‘T am standing!” 

Fall, you big-mouthed, little 
tyrant! Dr. West thought. 

Mao III pitched forward, up- 
setting the table and glass. At- 

OUR MAN IN PEKING 



tendants sprang from the shad- 
ows to assist Mao III. A sol- 
dier’s hand closed on Dr. West’s 
elbow to lead him from the room. 

Tell them to leave me alone! 
Dr. West thought. 

“Leave him alone,” Mao III 
gasped. 

Tell them to bring me a chair! 

“Bring him a chair.” Mao III 
collapsed on his couch. 

Dr. West sat down. His heavy 
legs were twitching, and he was 
reminded of Galvani’s early ex- 
periments with electricity and a 
frog’s legs. His legs tingled. His 
face felt liumb with shock. 

Those incredible Harvard 
medicine men! Heavy legs, elec- 
tric eels, biopMDwer, j>arapsych- 
ology, this was why they had con- 
nived to maneuver an American 
into close proximity with the 
Chairman of the Chinese Federa- 
tion of Nations, the ruler of four 
fifths of the population of the 
world. Within how many feet of 
Mao III did he have to remain? 

Dr. West was afraid he was a 
poor choice. Had the Harvard 
Circle selected him because Mao 
III once said he wanted to meet 
Dr. West eye to eye? Dr. West 
knew he was a helluva choice. 

When he was a med student at 
Harvard, Joe West had irritated 
Sammy Wynoski. “That’s not 
ESP, Joe. That’s a parlor trick.” 
But Joe West had possessed a 
certain empathy and power of 

57 




suggestion that sometimes ex- 
tended its corona to more imagi- 
native and gullible persons such 
as undergrad Tom Randolph. 

Professor Tom Randolph’s ex- 
periments at Duke University in 
which one soldier attempted to 
control another hadn’t satisfied 
the Defense Department. Now 
Dr. West remembered Tom Ran- 
dolph’s excuse. human’s bio- 
power to broadcast his thoughts 
through his neuron-electrical sys- 
tem is simply too weak.” 

But a man with biological bat- 
teries as powerful as an electric 
eel’s installed in his swollen legs, 
Dr. West thought, such a man 
from a close distance . Tell 
them to hrin^ me a ^hiss oi 
water. 

^‘Bring him a glass of water,” 
Mao III murmured hollowly from 
his couch. 

Because there were no peculiar 
reactions from the other Chinese 
in the room. Dr. West concluded 
that he had been neatly condition- 
ed to direct his control at only 
one man — Mao III. 

Tell them to prepare a couch 
for me. Tell them you believe I 
have a healing power. When I <am 
neat you, your paralysis is cured. 

When the water was brought. 
Dr. West was afraid to drink. It 
might be poisoned. He knew he 
would have to suppress such 
fears. Now every move would be 
into the unknown. 

58 



When the couch was brought. 
Dr. West was afraid to sleep. 
What was going on in Mao Ill’s 
head? The man had not spoken 
or moved since — 

‘T move. I speak,” Mao III 
said. “What do you wish to speak 
about?” 

O/eep until I awaken you. Dr. 

West lay there staring up at 
the triumphantly grinning faces 
of the Harvard Circle. 

Dr. George Bruning, boy won- 
der, geophysicist, astronaut, poli- 
tical climber, and buddy of the 
President. 

Dr. Sam Wynoski, chemopsy- 
chiatrist. 

Dr. Fred Gatson, bacteriolo- 
gist and ladder climber. 

Dr. Einar Johansen, neurosur- 
geon and electric eel fancier. 

Dr. Tom Randolph, parapsy- 
chologist. 

You C.I.A. master minds. Dr. 
West thought so gently that Mao 
III did not awaken, you’ve suc- 
ceeded in planting your man in 
Peking. 

But am I your man? You may 
have implanted general guidelines

Retu rn 



I t was not an ordinary gambling 
casino. And this, for the police 
i>f S.L.A., posed a special prob- 
lem. The outspacers who had set 
up the casino had placed their 
massive ship directly above the 
tables, so that in the event of a 
raid the jets would destroy the 
tables. Efficient, officer Joseph 
Tinbane thought to himself mo- 
rosely. With one blast the out- 
spacers left Terra and simultane- 
ously destroyed all evidence of 
their illegal activity. 

And, what was more, killed 
each and every human game- 
player who might otherwise have 
lived to give testimony. 

He sat now in his parked air- 
car, taking pinch after pinch of 
fine imported Dean Swift inch- 
kenneth snuff, then switched to 
the yellow tin which contained 
wren’s relish. The snuff cheered

him, but not very mudh. To his 
left, in the evening darkness, he 
could make out the shape of the 
outspacers’ upended ship, black 
and silent, with the enlarged 
walled space beneath it, equally 
dark and silent — but deceptive- 
ly so. 

‘We can go in there,” he said 
to his less experienced compan- 
ion officer, “but it’ll just mean 
getting killed.” We’ll have to 
trust the robots, he realized. 
Even if they are clumsy, prone 
to error. Anyhow they’re not 
alive. And not being alive, in a 



59 




project as this, constituted an 
advantage. 

‘‘The third has gone in,” of- 
ficer Falkes beside him said 
quietly. 

The slim shape, in human 
clothing, stopped before the door 
of the casino, rapped, waited. 
Presently the door opened. The 
robot gave the proper code-word 
and was admitted. 

“You think they’ll survive the 
take-off blast?” Tinbane asked. 
Falkes was an expert in robotics. 

“Possibly one might. Not all, 
though. But one will be enough.” 
Hot for the kill, officer Falkes 
leaned to peer past Tinbane; his 
youthful face was fixed in con- 
centration. “Use the bull-horn 
now. Tell them they’re under ar- 
rest. I see no point in waiting.” 

“The point I see,” Tinbane 
said, “is that it’s more comfort- 
ing to see the ship inert and the 
action going on underneath. We’ll 
wait.” 

“But no more robots are com- 
ing.” 

“Wait for them to send back 
their vid transmissions,” Tinbane 
said. After all, that comprised 
evidence — of a sort. And at 
police HQ it was now being rec- 
orded in permanent form. Still, 
his companion officer assigned to 
this project did have a point. 
Since the last of the three hu- 
manoid plants had gone in, noth- 
ing more would take place, now. 



Until the outspacers realized 
they had been infiltrated and 
put their typical planned pattern 
of withdrawal into action. “All 
right,” he said, and pushed down 
on the button which activated the 
bull-hom. 

L eaning, Falkes spoke into the 
bull-hom. At once the bull- 
horn said, “AS ORDER-REPRE- 
SENTATIVES OF SUPERIOR 
LOS ANGELES I AND THE 
MEN WITH ME INSTRUCT 
EVERYONE INSIDE TO 
COME OUT ONTO THE 
STREET COLLECTIVELY; I 
FURTHER INSTRUCT — ” 
His voice, from the bull-hom, 
disappeared as the initial take- 
off surge roared through the pri- 
mary jets of the outspacers’ 
ship. Falkes shrugged, grinned 
starkly at Tinbane. It didnH take 
them lon^y his mouth formed si- 
lently. 

As expected no one came out. 
No one in the casino escaped. 
Even when the structure which 
composed the building melted. 
The ship detached itself, leaving 
a soggy, puddled mass of wax- 
like matter behind it. And still 
no one emerged. 

All dead, Tinbane realized 
with mute shock. 

“Time to go in,” Falkes said 
stoically. He began to crawl into 
his neoasbestos suit, and, after 
a pause, so did Tinbane. 

GALAXY 




Together, the two officers en- 
tered the hot, dripping puddle 
which had been the casino. In 
the center, forming a mound, lay 
two of the three humanoid ro- 
bots; they had managed at the 
last moment to cover something 
with their bodies. Of the third 
Tinbane saw no sign; evidently 
it had been demolished along 
with everything else. Everything 
organic. 

I wonder what they thought — 
in their own dim way — to 
be worth preserving, Tinbane 
thought as he surveyed the dis- 
torted remnants of the two ro- 
bots. Something alive? One of the 
snail-like outspacers? Probably 
not. A gaming table, then. 

‘‘They acted fast,” Falkes 
said, impressed. “For robots.” 

“But we got something,” Tin- 
bane pointed out. Gingerly, he 
poked at the hot fused metal 
which had been the two robots. 
A section, most likely a torso, 
slid aside, revealed what the ro- 
bots had preserved. 

A pinball machine. 

Tinbane wondered why. What 
was this worth? Anything? Per- 
sonally, he doubted it. 

I n the police lab on Sunset Ave- 
nue in downtown Old Los An- 
geles, a technician presented a 
long written analysis to Tinbane. 

“TeU me orally,” Tinbane 
said, annoyed; he had been too 

RETURN AAATCH 



many years on the force to sutteci 
through such stuff. He returned 
the clipboard and report to Iho 
tall, lean police technician. 

“Actually it’s not an ordinary; 
construct,” the technician said, 
glancing over his own report, as 
if he had already forgotten it; 
his tone, like the report itself, 
was dry, dull. This for him was 
obviously routine. He, too, 
agreed that the pinball machine 
salvaged by the humanoid robots 
was worthless — or so Tinbane 
guessed. “By that I mean it’s not 
like any they’ve brought to Terra 
in the past. You can probably 
get more of an idea directly 
from the thing; I suggest you 
put a quarter in it and play 
through a game.” He added, 
“The lab budget will provide you 
with a quarter which we’ll re- 
trieve from the machine later.” 

“I’ve got my own quarter,” 
Tinbane said irritably. He fol- 
lowed the technician through the 
large, overworked lab, past the 
elaborate — and in many cases 
obsolete — assortment of analy- 
tical devices and partly broken- 
apart constructs to the work 
area in the rear. 

There, cleaned up, the damage 
done to it now repaired, stood 
the pinball machine which the 
robots had protected. Tinbane 
inserted a coin; five metal balls 
at once spilled into the reservoir, 
and the board at the far end of 

61 




tiie machine lit up in a variety of 
shifting colors. 

“Before you shoot the first 
ball,” the technician said to him, 
standing beside him so that he, 
too, could watch, “I advise you 
to take a careful look at the 
terrain of the machine, the com- 
ponents among which the ball will 
pass. The horizontal area be- 
neath the protective glass is 
somewhat interesting. A mini- 
ature village, complete with 
houses, lighted streets, major 
public buildings, overhead sprint- 
ship runnels . not a Terran 
village, of course. An Ionian vil- 
lage, of the sort they’re used to. 
The detail work is superb.” 
.Bending, Tinbane peered. The 
technician was right; the detail 
work on the scale-model struc- 
tures astounded him. 

“Tests that measure wear on 
the moving parts of this ma- 
chine,” the technician informed 
him, “indicate that it saw a 
great deal of use. There is con- 
siderable tolerance. We estimate 
that before another thousand 
games could be completed, the 
machine would have to go to the 
^op. Their shop, back on lo. 
Which is where we understand 
they build and maintain equip- 
ment of this variety.” He explain- 
ed, “By that I mean gambling 
layouts in general.” 

^What’s the object of the 
game?” Tinbane asked. 



“We have here,” the technician 
explained, “what we call a full- 
shift set variable. In other words, 
the terrain through which the 
steel ball moves is never the 
same. The number of possible « 
combinations is — ” he leafed 
through his report but was un- 
able to find the exact figure — 
“anyhow, quite great. In the mil- 
lions. It’s excessively intricate, in 
our opinion. Anyhow, if you’ll re- 
lease the first ball you’ll see.” 

Depressing the plunger, Tin- 
bane allowed the first ball to 
roll from the reservoir and against 
the impulse-shaft. He then drew 
back the springloaded shaft and 
snapped it into release. The ball 
shot up the channel and bounced 
free, against a pressure- cushion 
which imparted swift additional 
velocity to it. 

^^he ball now dribbled in des- 
' cent, toward the upper peri- 
meter of the village. 

“The initial defense line,” the 
technician said from behind him, 
“which protects the village pro- 
per, is a series of mounds color- 
ed, shaped and surfaced to re- 
semble the Ionian landscape. 
The fidelity is quite obviously 
painstaking. Probably made from 
satellites in orbit around lo. You 
can easily imagine you’re seeing 
an actual piece of that moon from 
a distance of ten or more miles 
up.

GALAXY 




The steel ball encountered the 
perimeter of rough terrain. Its 
trajectory altered, and the ball 
wobbled uncertainly, no longer 
going in any particular direction. 

‘‘Deflected,” Tinbane said, 
noting how satisfactorily the con- 
tours of the terrain acted to de- 
prive the ball of is descending 
forward motion. “It’s going to 
bypass the village entirely.” 

The ball, with severely de- 
creased momentum, wandered 
into a side crease, followed the 
crease listlessly, and then, just 
as it appeared to be drifting into 
the lower take-up slot, abruptly 
hurtled from a pressure-cushion 
and back into play. 

On the illuminated backboard 
a score registered. Victory, of a 
momentary sort, for the player. 
The ball once again menaced the 
village. Once again it dribbled 
through the rough terrain, follow- 
ing virtually the same path as 
before. 

“Now you’ll notice something 
moderately important,” the tech- 
nician said. “As it heads toward 
that same pressure- cushion which 
it just now hit. Don’t watch the 
ball; watch the cushion.” 

Tinbane watched. And saw, 
from the cushion, a tiny wisp of 
gray smoke. He turned inquiring- 
ly toward the technician. 

“Now watch the ball!” the 
technician said sharply. 

Again the ball struck the pres- 

RETURN MATCH 



sure-cushion inounted sli^tly. 
before the lower taKe-up dot. 
This time, however, the cushion 
failed to react to the ball’s im- 
pact. 

Tinbane blinked as the ball 
rolled harmlessly on, into the 
take-up slot and out of play. 

“Nothing happened,” he said 
presently. 

“That smoke that you saw. 
Emerging from the wiring of the 
cushion. An electrical short. Be- 
cause a rebound froni that spot 
placed the ball in a menacing 
position — menacing to the vil- 
lage.” 

“In other words,” Tinbane 
said, “something took note of the 
effect the cushion was having on 
the ball. The assembly operates 
so as to protect itself from the 
ball’s activity.” He had seen this 
before, in other outspacer gam- 
bling gear: sophisticated circuitry 
which kept the gameboard con- 
stantly shifting in such a way as 
to seem alive — in such a way 
as to reduce the chances of the 
player winning. On this particular 
construct the player obtained a 
winning score by inducing the 
five steel balls to pass into the 
central layout: the replica of the 
Ionian hamlet. Hence the hamlet 
had to be protected. Hence this 
particular strategically located 
pressure-clushion required elimi- 
nation. At least for the time be- 
ing. Until the overall configura- 

63 




tions of topography altered de- 
cidedly. 

CC^Jothing new there/^ the 
technician said. ‘‘YouVe 
seen it a dozen times before; 
I’ve seen it a hundred times be- 
fore. Let’s say that this pinball 
machine has seen ten thousand 
separate games, and each time 
there’s been a careful readjust- 
ment of the circuitry directed 
toward rendering the steel balls 
neutralized. Let’s say that the al- 
terations are cumulative. So by 
now any given player’s score is 
probably no more than a frac- 
tion of early scores, before the 
circuits had a chance to react. 
The direction of alteration — as 
in all outspacer gambling me- 
chanisms — has a zero win factor 
as the limit toward which it’s 
moving. Just try to hit the vil- 
lage, Tinbane. We set up a con- 
stantly repeating mechanical ball- 
release and played one hundred 
and forty games. At no time did 
a ball ever get near enough to 
do the village any harm. We 
kept a record ' of the scores ob- 
tained. A slight but significant 
drop was registered each time.” 
He grinned. 

^^So?” Tinbane said. 

*'So nothing. As I told you and 
as my report says.” The tech- 
nician paused, then. ‘‘Except for 
one thing. Look at this.” 

Bending, he traced his thin 

64 



finger across the protective glass 
of the layout, toward a con- 
struct near the center of the re- 
plica village. A photographic rec- 
ord shows that with each game 
that particular component be- 
comes rnore articulated. It’s be- 
ing erected by circuitry under- 
neath — obviously. As is every 
other change. But this configura- 
tion — doesn’t it remind you of 
something?” 

“Looks like a Roman cata- 
pult,” Tinbane said. “But with a 
vertical rather than a horizontal 
axis.” 

“That’s our reaction, too. And 
look at the sling. In terms of the 
scale of the village it’s inordinate- 
ly large. Immense, in fact; speci- 
fically, ifs not to scale,^^ 

“It looks as if it would almost 
hold — ” 

“Not almost,” the technician 
said. “We measured it. The size 
of the sling is exact; one of those 
steel balls would fit perfectly in- 
to it.” 

“And then?” Tinbane said, 
feeling chill. 

“And then it would hurl the 
ball back at the player,” the lab 
technician said calmly. “It’s 
aimed directly toward the front 
of the machine, front and up- 
ward.” He added, “And it’s been 
virtually completed.” 

T he best defense, Tinbane 
thought to himself as he 

GALAXY 




studied the outspacers’ illegal 
pinball machine, is offense. But 
whoever heard of it in this con- 
text? 

Zero, he realized, isn’t a low 
enough score to suit the defen- 
sive circuitry of the thing. Zero 
won’t do. It’s got to strive for 
less than zero. Why? Because, he 
decided, it’s not really irioving 
toward zero as a limit; it’s mov- 
ing, instead, toward the best de- 
fensive pattern. It’s too well de- 
signed. 

Or is it? 

'‘You think,” he asked the lean, 
tall lab technician, "that the out- 
spacers intended this?” 

"That doesn’t matter. At least 
not from the immediate stand- 
point. What matters is two fac- 
tors: the machine was exported 
— in violation of Terran law — 
to Terra, and it’s been played by 
Terrans. Intentionally or not, 
this could be, in fact will soon 
be, a lethal weapon.” He added, 
"We calculate within the next 
twenty games. Every time a coin 
is inserted, the building resumes. 
Whether a ball gets near the 
village or not. All it requires is 
a flow of power from the de- 
vice’s central helium battery. 
And that’s automatic, once play 
begins.” He added, "It’s at work 
building the catapult ri^t now, 
as we stand here. You better re- 
lease the remaining four balls, so 
it’ll shut itself off. Or give us 

RETURN /AATCH 



permission to dismantle it — to 
at least take the power-supply 
out of the circuit.” 

"The outspacers, don’t have a 
very high regard for human life,” 
Tinbane reflected. He was think- 
ing of the carnage created by the 
ship taking off. And that, for 
them, was routine. But in view 
of that wholesale destruction of 
human life, this seemed unneces- 
sary. What more did this accom- 
plish? 

Pondering, he said, "This is 
selective. This would eliminate 
only the game-player.” 

The technician said, "This 
would eliminate every game- 
player. One after another.” 

"But who would play the 
thing,” Tinbane said, "after the 
first fatality?” 

"People go there knowing that 
if there’s a raid the outspacers 
will bum up everyone and 
ever3rthing,” the technician point- 
ed out. "The urge to gamble is 
an addictive compulsion; a cer- 
tain tjrpe of person gambles no 
matter what the risk is. You 
ever hear of Russian Roulette?” 
Tinbane released the second 
steel ball, watched it bounce and 
wander toward the replica vil- 
lage. This one managed to pass 
through the rough terrain; it ap- 
proached the first house com- 
prising the village proper. May- 
be I’ll get it, he thought savage- 
ly. Before it gets me. A strange, 

65 




novel excitement filled him as 
he watched the ball thud against 
the tiny house, flatten the struc- 
ture and roll on. The ball, al- 
though small to him, towered 
over every building, every struc- 
ture, that made up the village. 

— Every structure except the 
central catapult. He watched 
avidly as the ball moved danger- 
ously close to the catapult, then, 
deflected by a major public build- 
ing, rolled on and disappeared 
into the take-up slot. Immedi- 
ately he sent the third ball hurt- 
ling up its channel. 

‘‘The stakes,” the lab tech- 
nician said softly, “are high, 
aren’t they? Your life against 
its. Must be exceptionally appeal- 
ing to someone with the right 
kind of temperament.” 

“I think,” Tinbane said, “I 
can get the catapult before it’s 
in action.” 

“Maybe. Maybe not.” 

“I’m getting the ball closer to 
it each time.” 

The technician said, “For the 
catapult to work, it requires one 
of the steel balls; that’s its load. 
You’re making it increasingly 
likely that it’ll acquire use of 
one of the balls. You’re actually 
helping it.” He added somberly, 
“In fact it can’t function with- 
out you; the gameplayer is not 
only the enemy, he’s also essen- 
tial. Better quit, Tinbane. The 
thing is using you.” 



“I’ll quit,” Tinbane said, 
“when I’ve gotten the catapult.” 
“You’re damn right you will. 
You’ll be dead.” He eyed Tin- 
bane narrowly. “Possibly this is 
why the outspacers built it. To 
get back at us for our raids. This 
very likely is what it’s for.” 

“Got another quarter?” Tin- 
bane said. 

I n the middle of his tenth game 
a surprising, unexpected al- 
teration in the machine’s strategy 
manifested itself. All at once it 
ceased routing the steel balls en- 
tirely to one side, away from the 
replica village. 

Watching, Tinbane saw the 
steel ball roll directly — for the 
first time — through the center. 
Straight toward the proportional- 
ly massive catapult. 

Obviously the catapult had 
been completed. 

“I outrank you, Tinbane,” the 
lab technician said tautly. “And 
I’m ordering you to quit playing.” 
“Any order from you to me,” 
Tinbane said, “has to be in writ- 
ing and has to be approved by 
someone in the department at in- 
spector level.” But, reluctantly, 
he halted play. “I can get it,” he 
said reflectively, “but not stand- 
ing here. I have to be away, far 
enough back so that it can’t pick 
me off.” So it can’t distinguish 
me and aim, he realized. 

Already he had noted it swivel 



66 



GALAXY 




slightly. Through some lens-sys- 
tem it had detected him. Or pos- 
sibly it was thermotropic, had 
sensed him by his body heat. 

If the latter, then defensive 
action for him would be relative- 
ly simple: a resistance coil sus- 
pended at another locus. On the 
other hand it might be utilizing 
a cephalic index of some sort, 
recording all nearby brain-ema- 
nations. But the police lab would 
know that already. 

‘What’s its tropism?” he ask- 
ed. 

The technician said. “That as- 
sembly hadn’t been built up, at 
the time we inspected it. It’s 
undoubtedly coming into exis- 
tence now, in concert with the 
completion of the weapon.” 

Tinbane said thoughtfully, “I 
hope it doesn’t possess equip- 
ment to record a cephalic index.” 
Because, he thought, if it did, 
storing the pattern would be no 
trouble at all. It could retain a 
memory of its adversary for use 
in the event of future encoun- 
ters. 

Something about that notion 
fri^tened him — over and above 
the immediate menace of the 
situation. 

“I’ll make a deal,” the tech- 
nician said. “You continue to 
operate it until it fires its initial 
shot at you. Then step aside and 
let us tear it down. We need to 
know its tropism; tins may turn 

RETURN AAATCH 



up again in a more complex fash- 
ion. You agree? You’ll be taking 
a calculated risk, but I believe 
its initial shot will be aimed with 
the idea of use as feedback; it’ll 
correct for a second shot . 
which will never take place.” 

Should he tell the technician 
his fear? 

“What bothers me,” he said, 
“is the possibility that it’ll retain 
a specific memory of me. For 
future puiposes.” 

‘What future purposes? It’ll be 
completely torn down. As soon 
as it fires.” 

Reluctantly, Tinbane said, “I 
think I’d better make the deal.” 
I may already have gone too far, 
he thought. You may have been 
right. 

^'^he next steel ball missed the 
catapult by only a matter 
of a fraction of an inch. But 
what unnerved him was not the 
closeness; it was the quick, subtle 
attempt on the part of the cata- 
pult to snare the ball as it passed. 
A motion so rapid that he might 
easily have overlooked it; 

“It wants that ball,” the tech- 
nician observed. “It wants you.” 
He, too, had seen. 

With hesitation, Tinbane touch- 
ed the plunger which would re- 
lease the next — and for him 
possibly the last — steel ball. 

“Back out,” the technician ad- 
Sdsed nervously. “Forget the deal; 

67 




stop playing. We’ll tear it down 
as it is.’* 

**We need the tropism,” Tin- 
bane said. And depressed the 
plunger. 

The steel ball, suddenly seem- 
ing to him huge and hard and 
heavy, rolled unhesitatingly in- 
to the waiting catapult; every 
contour of the machine’s topo- 
graphy collaborated. The acquisi- 
tion of the load took place be- 
fore he even understood what 
had happened. He stood staring. 

‘‘Run!” The technician leaped 
back, bolted; crashing against 
Tinbane, he threw him bodily 
away from the machine. 

With a clatter of broken glass 
the steel ball shot by Tinbane’s 
right temple, bounced against the 
far wall of the lab, came to rest 
under a work table. 

Silence. 

After a time the technician 
said shakily, ‘It had plenty of 
velocity. Plenty of mass. Plenty 
of what it needed.” 

Haltingly, Tinbane stood up, 
took a step toward the machine. 

‘T)on’t release another ball,” 
the technician said warningly. 

Tinbane said, ‘T don’t have 
to.” He turned, then, sprinted 
away. 

The machine had released the 
ball itself. 

I n the outer office, Tinbane sat 
smoking, seated across from 

68 



Ted Donovian, the lab chief. The 
door to the lab had been shut, 
and every one of the several lab 
technicians had been bull-homed 
to safety. Beyond the closed door 
the lab was silent. Inert, Tinbane 
thought, and waiting. 

He wondered if it was waiting 
for anyone, any human, any Ter- 
ran, to come within reach. Or — 
just him. 

The latter thought amused 
him even less than it had origin- 
ally; even seated out here he 
felt himself cringe. A machine 
built on another world, sent to 
Terra empty of direction, mere- 
ly capable of sorting among all 
its defensive possibilities until at 
last it stumbled onto the key. 
Randomness at work, through 
hundreds, even thousands of 
games . through person aftei 
person, player after player. Until 
at last it reached critical direc- 
tion, and the last person to play 
it, also selected by the process 
of randomness, became welded to 
it in a contract of death. In this 
case, himself. Unfortunately. 

Ted Donovan said, “We’ll 
spear its power source from a 
distance; that shouldn’t be hard. 
You go on home, forget about it. 
When we have its tropic circuit 
laid out we’ll notify you. Unless 
of course it’s late at night, in 
which case — ” 

“Notify me,” Tinbane said, 
“whatever time it is. If you will.” 

GALAXY 




He did not have to explain; the 
lab chief understood. 

‘‘Obviously,” Donovan said, 
“this construct is aimed at the 
police teams raiding the casinos. 
How they steered our robots onto 
it we don’t of course know — 
yet. We may find that circuit, 
too.” He picked up the already 
extant lab report, eyed it with 
hostility. “This was far too cur- 
sory, it would now appear. ‘Just 
another outspacer gambling de- 
vice.’ The hell it is.” He tossed 
the report away, disgusted. 

“If that’s what they had in 
mind,” Tinbane said, “they got 
what they wanted; they got me 
completely.” At least in terms of 
hooking him. Of snaring his at- 
tention. And his cooperation. 

“You’re a gambler; you’ve got 
the streak. But you didn’t know 
it. Possibly it wouldn’t have 
worked otherwise.” Donovan add- 
ed, ‘^but it is interesting. A pin- 
ball machine that fi^ts back. 
That gets fed up with steel balls 
rolling over it. I hope they don’t 
build a skeet-shoot. This is bad 
enough.” 

“Dreamlike,” Tinbane mur- 
mured. 

“Pardon?” 

“Not really real.” But, he 
thought, it is real. He rose, then, 
to his feet. “I’lrdo what you say; 
I’ll go on home to my conapt. 
You have the vidphone num- 
ber.” He felt tired and afraid. 



“You look terrible,” Dono- 
van said, scrutinizing him. “It 
shouldn’t get you to this extent; 
this is a relatively benign con- 
struct, isn’t it? You have to at- 
tack it, to set it in motion. If left 
alone — ” 

“I’m leaving it alone,” Tin- 
bane said. “But I feel it’s wait- 
ing. It wants me to come back.” 
He felt it expecting him, antici- 
pating his return. The machine 
was capable of learning and he 
had taught it — taught it about 
himself. 

Taught it that he existed. That 
there was such a person on Terra 
as Joseph Tinbane. 

And that was too much. 

T T^hen he unlocked the door 
^ ^ of his conapt the phone was 
already ringing. Leadenly, he 
picked up the receiver. “Hello,” 
he said. 

“Tinbane?” It was Donovan’s 
voice. “It’s encephalotropic, all 
right. We found a pattern-print 
of your brain configuration, and 
of course we destroyed it. But — ” 
Donovan hesitated. “We also 
found something else it had con- 
structed since the initial analy- 
sis” 

“A transmitter,” Tinbane said 
hoarsely. 

“Afraid so. Half-mile of broad- 
cast, two miles if beamed. And 
it was cupped to beam, so we 
have to assume the two-mile

Anyhow, now you know. So it’s 
decidedly a vengeance weapon; 
your emotional response was un- 
fortunately correct. When our 
double- dome experts looked this 
over they drew the conclusion 
that you were waited-for, so to 
speak. It saw you coming. The 
instrument may never have func- 
tioned as an authentic gambling 
device in the first place; the 
tolerances which we noted may 
have been built in, rather than 
the result of wear. So that’s about 
it.” 

Tinbane said, “What do you 
suggest I do?” 

“ ^Do’P” A pause. “Not much. 
Stay in your conapt; don’t report 
for work, not for a while.” 

So if they nail me, Tinbane 
thought, no one else in the de- 
partment will get hit at the same 
time. More advantageous for the 
rest of you; hardly for me, 
though. “I think I’ll get out of 
the area,” he said aloud. “The 
structure may be limited in 
space, confined to S.L.A. or just 
one part of the city. If you don’t 
veto it.” He had a girl friend, 
Nancy Hackett, in La Jolla; he 
could go there. 

“Suit yourself.”

He said, “You can’t do any- 
thing to help me, thou^.” 

“I tell you what,” Donovan 
said. “We’ll allocate some funds, 
a moderate sum, best we can, on 
which you can function. Until we 
track down the damn receiver 
and find out what it’s tied to. 
For us, the main headache is that 
word of this matter has begun to 
filter through the department. 
It’s going to be hard getting 
crack-down teams to tackle fu- 
ture outspacer gambling opera- 
tions . which of course is 
specifically what they had in 
mind. One more thing we 
can do. We can have the lab 
build you a brain-shield so you 
no longer emanate a recognizable 
template. But you’d have to pay 
for it out of your own pocket. 
Possibly it could be debited 
against your salary, payments 
divided over several months. If 
you’re interested. Frankly, if you 
want my personal opinion, I’d ad- 
vise it.” 

“All right,’! Tinbane said. He 
felt dull, dead, tired and resign- 
ed; all of those at once. And he 
had the deep and acute intuition 
that his reaction was rational. 
“Anything else you suggest?” he 
asked. 

“Stay armed. Even when you’re 
asleep.” 

‘What asleep?” he said. “You 
think I’m going to get any sleep? 
Maybe I will after that machine

is totally destroyed.” But that 
won’t make any difference, he 
realized. Not now. Not after it’s 
dispatched my brain-wave pat- 
t^ti to something else, something 
we know nothing about. God 
knows what equipment it might 
turn out to be; outspacers show 
up with all kinds of convoluted 
things. 

T T e hung up the phone, walked 
into his kitchen, and, getting 
down a half- empty fifth of An- 
tique bourbon, fixed himself a 
whiskey sour. 

What a mess, he said to him- 
self. Pursued by a pinball ma- 
chine from another world. He 
almost — but not quite — had 
to laugh. 

What do you use, he asked him- 
self, to catch an angry pinball 
machine? One that has your num- 
ber and is out to get you? Or 
more specifically, a pinball ma- 
chine’s nebulous friend . 

Something went tap tap against 
the kitchen window. 

Reaching into his pocket he 
brought out his regulation-issue 
laser pistol; walking along the 
kitchen wall he approached the 
window from an unseen side, 
peered out into the night. Dark- 
ness. He could make nothing 
out. Flashlight? He had one in 
the glove compartment of his air- 
car, parked on the roof of the 
conapt building. Time to get it 

RETURN /AATCH 



A moment later, flashli^t in 
hand, he raced downstairs, back 
to his kitchen. 

The beam of the flashlight 
showed, pressed against the 
outer surface of the window, a 
buglike entity with projecting 
elongated pseudopodia. The two 
feelers had tapped against the 
glass of the window, evidently ex- 
ploring in their blind, mechanical 
way. 

The bug-thing had ascended 
the side of the building; he could 
perceive the suction-tread by 
which it clung. 

His curiosity, at this point, be- 
came greater than his fear. With 
care he opened the window — 
no need of having to pay the 
building repair committee for it 
— and cautiously took aim with 
his laser pistol. The bug-thing did 
not stir; evidently it had stalled 
in midcycle. Probably its re- 
sponses, he guessed, were re- 
latively slow, much more so 
than a comparable organic equiv- 
alent. Unless, of course, it was 
set to detonate; in which case 
he had no time to ponder. 

He fired a narrow-beam into 
the underside of the bug-thing. 

Maimed, the bug-thing settled 
backward, its many little cups re- 
leasing their hold. As it fell away, 
Tinbane caught hold of it, lifted 
it swiftly into the room, dropped 
it onto the floor, meantime keep- 
ing his pistol pointed at it. But 

71 




it was finished functionally; it 
did not stir. 

Laying it on the small kitchen 
table he got a screwdriver from: 
the tool-drawer beside the sink, 
seated himself, examined the ob- 
ject. He felt, now, that he could 
take his time; the pressure, mo- 
mentarily at least, had abated. 

It took him forty minutes to 
get the thing open; none of the 
holding screws fitted an ordi- 
nary screwdriver, and he foun^i 
himself at last using a common 
kitchen knife. But finally he had 
it open before him on the table, 
its shell divided into two parts: 
one hollow and empty, the other 
crammed with components. A 
bomb? He tinkered with exceed- 
ing care, inspecting each assem- 
bly bit by bit. 

No bomb — at least none 
which he could identify. Then a 
murder tool? No blade, no toxins 
or micro-organisms, no tube 
capable of expelling a lethal 
charge, explosive or otherwise. So 
then what in God^s name did it 
do? He recognized the motor 
which had driven it up the side 
of the building, then the photo- 
electric steering turret by which 
it oriented itself. But that was 
all. Absolutely all. 

From the standpoint of use, it 
was a fraud. 

_ w 

Or was it? He examined his 
watch. Now he had spent an en- 
tire hour on it; his attention had 

72 



been diverted from everything 
else — and who knew what that 
else might be? 

"VJervously, he slid stiffly to his 
feet, collected his laser 
pistol, and prowled throughout 
the apartment, listening, won- 
dering, trying to sense something, 
however small, that was out of 
its usual order. 

It’s giving them time, he re- 
alized. One entire hour! For 
whatever it is they’re really up 
to. 

Time, he thought, for me to 
leave the apartment. To get to 
La Jolla and the hell out of 
here, until this is all over with. 

His vidphone rang. 

When he answered it, Ted 
Donovan’s face clicked grayly in- 
to view. “We’ve got a department 
aircar monitoring your conapt 
building,” Donovan said. “And it 
picked up some activity; I 
thought you’d want to know.” 

“Okay,” he said tensely. 

“A vehicle, airborne, landed 
briefly on your roof parking lot. 
Not a standard aircar but some- 
thing larger. Nothing we could 
recognize. It took right off again 
at great speed, but I think this is 
it.” 

“Did it deposit anything?” he 
asked. 

“Yes. Afraid so.” 

Tight-lipped, he said, “Can 
you do anything for me at this 

GALAXY 




late point? It would be appreci- 
ated very much.” 

‘What do you suggest? We 
don’t know what it is; you cer- 
tainly don’t know either. We*re 
open to ideas, but I think well 
have to wait imtil you know the 
nature of the — hostile artifact.” 
Something bumped against his 
door. Something in the hall. 

“I’ll leave the line open,” Tin- 
bane said. “Don’t leave; I think 
it’s happening now.” He felt 
panic, at this stage; overt, child- 
ish panic. Carrying his laser 
pistol in a numb, loose grip he 
made his way step by step to the 
locked front door of his conapt, 
halted, then unlocked the door 
and opened it. Slightly. As little 
as he could manage. 

An enormous, unchecked force 
pushed the door further; the knob 
left his hand. And, soundlessly, 
the vast steel ball resting against 
the halfopen door rolled forward. 
He stepped aside — he had to 
— knowing that this was the ad- 
versary; the dummy wall- climb- 
ing gadget had deflected his at- 
tention from this. 

He could not get out. He would 
not be going to La Jolla now. 
The great massed sphere totally 
blocked the way. 

Returning to the vidphone he 
said to Donovan, “I’m encapsu- 
lated. Here in my own conapt.” 
At the outer perimeter, he realiz- 
ed. Equal to the rough terrain of 



the pinball machine’s shifting 
landscape. The first ball has been 
blocked there, has lodged in the 
doorway. But what about the sec- 
ond? The third? 

Each would be closer. 

“Can you build something for 
me?” he asked huskily. “Can the 
lab start working this late at 
night?” 

“We can try,” Donovan said. 
“It depends entirely on what you 
want. What you have in mind? 
What do you think would help?” 

He hated to ask for it. But he 
had to. The next one mj,ght burst 
in through a window, or crash 
onto him from the roof. “I want,” 
he said, “some form of catapult. 
Big enough, tough enough, to 
handle a spherical load with a 
diameter of between four and a 
half and five feet. You think you 
can manage it?” He prayed to 
god they could. 

“Is that what you’re facing?” 
Donovan said harshly. 

“Unless it’s an hallucination,” 
Tinbane said. “A deliberate, arti- 
ficially induced terror-projection, 
designed specifically to demora- 
lize me.” 

“The department aircar saw 
something,” Donovan said. “And 
it wasn’t an hallucination; it had 
measurable mass. And — ” He 
hesitated. “It did leave off some- 
thing big. Its departing mass 
was considerably diminished. So 
it’s real, Tinbane.”

Tinbane, nodding lit a ciga- 
rette, or at least tried to. But his 
hands were shaking too badly to 
get the lighter into place. He then 



got out a yellow-lacquered tin of 
dean’s own snuff, but found him- 
self unable to force open the tight 
tin; the tin hopped from his fin- 
gers and fell to the floor. “Five,” 
he said, “per ^ame.” 

“Yes,” Donovan said reluct- 
antly, “there’s that.” 

The wall of the living room

him from the adjoining apart-

WHO INVENTED 



THE CROSSBOW? 



I t is simply impassible to find 
an article on crossbows or 
medieval warfare that neglects to 
mention that the Second Lateran 
Council, in 1139, forbade the use 
of the crossbow to Christians 
except for hunting or against in- 
fidels — and that Pope Innocen- 
tius III, later in the same century. 










Fig. 1. Picture of a crossbow from a Ro- 
man grave In France. 



reaffirmed this prohibitus est. 
Britisih writers, as a rule, add the 
information that the crossbow 
was introduced in England in 
1066 by the invading Normans, 
but that it never became as popu- 
lar in England as it was on the 
continent. 

While saying aU this, most wri- 
ters create the impression — and 
seem to be under that impression 
themselves — that the crossbow 
must have been a fairly recent 
invention at the time the Lateran 
Council adjourned. Since it is cer- 
tain that crossbows existed at a i. 
much earlier time, it is logical to 
assume that the weapon achieved 
a sudden surge in popularity 

76 



around the year 1100, leading to 
ecclesiastical measures. Such sud- 
den surges are usually the result 
of an improvement of some kind, 
and the most likely improvement 
for that period was the introduc- 
tion of a steel bow instead of a 
wooden bow. 

If the older crossbows had 
wooden bows, they either had to 
be so large as to be unwieldy or, 
if small enough, both their range 
and their penetrating power must 
have been inferior to the normal 
bow. As a matter of fact British 
writers have occasionally won- 
dered in print why the crossbow 
became popular at all. Even at 
the height of its development a 
crossbow bolt did not carry much 




Fig. 2. Tbe Greek gasfrophefes, oldest 
known picture of a crossbow. 

GALAXY 




fartjier thaa an arrow from a 
longbow, and both could pene- 
trate a shield that a man could 
carry. Moreover, a good longbow 
man could get off ten arrows in 
the time a crossbow man could 
shoot three bolts. All true; but 
a man who had never used a 
crossbow would be a good shot 
after three weeks of five hours of 
training every day, while an ar- 
chery apprentice with a longbow 
was still a beginner after the same 
amount of practice. 

So there was a good reason 
for the popularity of the cross- 
bow, after the introduction of 
steel had made it at least equal 
in power to a heavy longbow in 
the hands of a strong man. 

It is true that references to 
crossbows prior to the famous 
edict of the Lateran Council are 
rare, but they exist. Roman 
writers had occasionally men- 
tioned a weapon they called 
manuballista or aicuhallista . 
but there could be some doubt 
whether the term actually re- 
ferred to crossbows. Considered 
aS a word, *‘manuballista^^ just 
meant a device that threw some- 
thing and that a warrior held in 
(or operated with) his hands, and 
that still left many possibilities 
open. But such doubts were re- 
solved in 1831. During that year 
a Roman burial monument with 
bas reliefs was found near Polig- 
nac sur Loire in France; it was 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



later brought to the museum at 
Puy, and artists could sketch the 
bas reliefs. Among them was an 
unmistakable crossbow, complete 
with pharetra, the Roman term 
for a quiver, as shown in Fig. 1. 
Unfortunately the artist who 
made the bas relief must have 
been poorly acquainted with the 
weapon, for most of the things 
one would dearly like to know are 
simply not shown. It is not clear, 
for example, whether this cross- 
bow was bent by hand or whether 
a medhanical device of some kind 




was needed. And the most inter- 
esting part, the lock mechanism, 
is hardly indicated. 

Nor can the age of the monu- 
ment be established. Its location 
in France indicates that the burial 
took place while the Romans ex- 
tended over all of western Eu- 
rope, but this leaves a leeway of 
several centuries. 

F rtunately we are on much 
firmer ground with another 
ancient crossbow (Fig. 2.) that 
goes under the Greek name of 

77 



gastrophetes; it is a bit disap- 
pointing that this impressive- 
sounding word just means ‘‘belly 
gun.” But at least there is a rea- 
son for this name. The “belly 
gun” was cocked by resting the 
front end (F) of the slide on the 
ground and leaning the body 
weight on the semicircle between 
the two pieces L and R, which 
may have been resting on the 
shoulders of the man while shoot- 
ing the weapon. 

We know about the gastro- 
phetes from what is left of the 
writings of one Ktesibios. 
Though there were several 
people by that name, it is 
pretty certain that the Ktesibios 
in question is the one who lived 
during the reign of Ptolemy

Physkon (170-117 B.C.), which 
makes him a contemporary of 
Philon of Byzantium, another 
writer who has supplied us with 
some information about the wea- 
pons then in use. Philon’s 
Belopoiika — also known as his 
78 



Fourth Book on Mechanics — 
did not say anything about cross- 
bows, at least not in the portions 
of his work that we still have. 
But he wrote at length about 
catapults. The Greek experts who 
had the Prussian Academy of Sci- 




Fig. 5. The lock of Philon's catapult. 



ences reissue the work (Greek 
original with German translation) 
in 1918 pointed out that Philon’s 
style was clumsy and redundant 
and that he often sounds pleased 
that he managed to explain some- 
thing. Personally I wonder 
whether Philon’s clumsy and re- 
dundant style was the result of 
trying hard to explain difficult 
concepts to practical men who 
were handy with tools but not 
literary lights. 

At any event Philon carefully 
described two of the weapons of 
his time, the euthytonon and the 
palintonon. They were fairly 
much alike, except that the eu- 
thytonon (see Figs. 3 and 4) shot 
large arrows while the palintonon 
threw round stones. Very likely 
the euthytonon was used for 
pointblank shooting when the 

GALAXY 




enemy actually attacked, wihile 
the palintonon was used to har- 
rass the enemy while he was be- 
hind fortified positions. 

The construction of the euthy- 
tonon was quite advanced, and 
Philon’s description makes one 
thing quite clear: it was not a 
large crossbow. In the crossbow, 
from the gastrophetes to the mo- 
dern target crossbow, the en- 
ergy is stored into bending some- 
thing flexible, wood or steel. In 
the euthytonon, and in all simi- 
lar weapons that were built for 
the next sixteen centuries to 
come, the arms are not flexible 
but rigid. The energy is stored 
in skeins, of cord, or strips of 
rawhide or horsehair that are 
twisted around the end of these 
rigid arms. The bow is not bent 
— in fact, there is no bow to be- 
gin with — but elastic skeins are 
twisted. As the pictures show, the 
weapon was wound up by means 
of a small windlass. Two ratchet 
hooks saw to it that the weapon 
did not become unwound just be- 
cause a hand slipped on the 
spokes of the windlass. The final 
catch (Fig. 5) consists of a hook 
that admits the string of the cata- 
pult but could not hold it under 
tension. It is made secure by 
sliding a piece of metal (black 
in Fig. 5) under it. To discharge 
the weapon this piece of metal 
was yanked out or knocked out 
by a hammer blow.

ieval crossbow. 



A mechanism involving a sud- 
den jerk or blow was, of 
course, impossible with a porta- 
ble weapon since it would spoil 
the aim. The crossbow makers of 
the middle ages came up with a 
different mechanism that is us- 
ually referred to as the ^‘revolv- 
ing nut’’ (Fig. 6). While the cross- 
bow is being bent, or wound up, 
or cocked, the revolving nut has 
the position shown at left. The 
string of the bow, still being 
tensed, slowly turns it until it 
has reached the position shown at 
right, at which point a steel piece 
at the bottom goes into action

and locks it. This strip of steel is 
connecti^ SVith the trigger. The 
trigger of a crossbow used to be 
laige, and in most models the 
triggei: was not slowly pulled 
back as in modern firearms, but 
lifted in the direction of the stock 
of the crossbow. 

Now, the whole point of the 
crossbow was that it was power- 
ful. Its string could not simply 
be pulled back by the action of 
four fingers as in an ordinary 
bow. To bend a crossbow needed 
at the very least both hands of 
the sharpshooter; this led to 




f 

ur 

r

apult. 



the strange distinction of a “one 
foot crossbow” and a “two feet 
crossbow.” The one foot cross- 
bow had a stirrup attached to its 
front end. The crossbow man 
placed this stirrup on the ground, 
put one foot into it and pulled 
the string up with both hands 
until it caught in the revolving 
nut. For the more powerful “two 



feet crossbow” both feet were 
needed to steady the weapon. 
For this reason the bow was at- 
tached right to the front end of 
the stock so that the crossbow 
man could place one foot on each 
side of the stock when bending 
the bow. 

For the still more powerful ver- 
sions even this was not enough. 
They were equipped with a small 
windlass or a so-called crane- 
quin, a wind-up device that was 
placed on top of the crossbow 
prior to cocking it. Of course it 
had to be removed prior to shoot- 
ing, which did not increase the 
frequency with which bolts could 
be thrown against the enemy. 
Somewhat simpler was a cocking 
lever of which Fig. 7 shows an 
interesting variation. The picture 
shows the starting position and 
it is quite obvious how the lever 
worked. But then, once the cross- 
bow was cocked, the lever (which 
could also be detached complete- 
ly) was folded down over the 
front end to provide a support. 
With a 30-inch lever the support 
was too ^ort for shooting while 
standing, but it had just the right 
length for shooting from a kneel- 
ing position. 

Since crossbows of the more 
powerful types had ranges up to 
350 yards, especially when shot 
by the defenders of a castle or a 
walled city who had the advan- 
tage of an elevation of thirty 




GAUXY 



feet or more over the attackers, 
the sdege engines that were the 
descendants of the euthytonon 
and palintonon had to have a 
slightly longer range, say 400 
yards or better. 

Ciege engines, ballistas and 
^ catapults, blidas and spring- 
ards, mangonals and trebuchets 
— they have a multitude of 
names, and in most cases we can 
be sure what a manuscript really 
means only if we have a sketch 
to go along with the description. 
There are at least two reasons for 
the multitude of names: Italian 
words that may have had Latin

or Greek roots originally were 
adapted by the French fo their 
own tongues, then the Germans 
took either the Italian or the 
French form, and sometimes 
both, and Germanized them. 
Then, twenty or fifty years later 
somebody would translate the 
term into German, not always 
skillfully. In addition to this prob- 
lem of overlapping languages, 
pride played a role. Some small 
army, say, had two large siege 
engines of which they were, na- 
turally, quite proud. So they were 
given names, like ships. But if 
these names were in any way 
unusual, a chronicler half a cen- 
tury later and living elsewhere, 
might think that these were speci- 
al types of siege engines. Mis- 
taken translations and misunder- 
stood names lengthened the lists. 

The same thing happened, a 
few centuries later, with real guns, 
until finally the gunnery master 
of the city of Frankfurt am Main, 
Leonhart Fronsperger by name, 
cried out in despair: ^‘Of all the 
guns that are pulled into the field 
there are just eight [types], four 
wall breakers and four field 
pieces, and even if you give a 

thousand names to them there 

.< 

are still just eight and not 
more.” Master Gunner Fronsper- 
ger classified his guns by the 
weight of shot; we’ll have to 
classify the siege engines by types 
to get anywhere. 

81 




The confusion must have start- 
ed early because an otherwise 
very competent book states that 
there were only two types origi- 
n^ly: one which the Romans 
called caiapultus and the Greeks 
Katapeltes and another one 
which the Romians called ballis- 
ta and the Greeks lithoholos, 




Fig. 10. CounterweigTif engine, also known 
as Trebuchet. 



Now, lithoholos is easy to 
translate; it means “stone throw- 
er’’ — that would be the palin- 
tonon of Philon. As for the word 
katapeltes an attempt at transla- 
tion is a little more difficult. 
There was a very similar Greek 
military term that meant “to 
overrun” (an en^y position) ; 
but the name may^^;^ be derived 
from the two Greek, words for 

“down” and for “shield.” In 

. « 

either case one is rdninded of 
Philon’s euthytonon. But from 
the engineering point of view the 
arrow-shooting and the stone- 



throwing devices were - one and 
the same thing. Both looked like 
crossbows; both had rigid arms 
and were wound by means of a 
windlass. And in both the energy 
was stored by twisting skeins of a 
flexible material. 

Since it was torsion that did 
the work, the whole family of 
siege engines — “and even if 
they bore a thousand names” — 
should be referred to as the “tor- 
sion engines.” A one-armed tor- 
sion engine, the ones called 
“catapults” in historical novels 
and movies, is shown as Fig. 8. 
Here a very large “spoon” had 
its handle inserted in a horizontal 
skein of rawhide strips and, when 
released, struck a horizontal and 
padded member. The main ad- 
vantage of this type of weapon 
was that almost anything could 
be put into the hollow of the 
spoon: rocks, inflammable sub- 
stances, trussed-up dead animals 
and anything else that might be 
handy. 

In all of these siege engines all 
the tension just prior to shooting 
was sustained by a single rope. 
In the movies a burly but some- 
how noble looking warrior stands 
by with a sharp sword or a hefty 
battle axe to sever this rope. In 
reality the armorers of the middle 
ages used the slip-hook (Fig. 9) 
that parted reliably when yanked 
sideways and that could be re- 
used any number of times.

GALAXY 



A nd now we come to the sec- 
ond type of siege engine, call- 
ed trebuchet by the French and 
blida (pronounced like ‘‘bleeder”) 
by the Germans. Technically this 
was a counterweight engine (Fig. 
10.) A sturdy wooden basket 
with a heavy metal frame was 
filled with rocks, then the long 
throwing arm was pulled down by 
means of a winch, and the mis- 
sile was placed on a spoon or 
basket at the end. 

Many medieval pic'tures show 
a sling attached to the end of the 
throwing arm, and it is stated 
that this Sling extended the 
length of the arm and therefore 
the range. But since such a sling 
had to open at just the right 
moment I have severe doubts 
that it was used often. In a small 
model which I helped to build 
when I was in high school the 
sling simply never opened. For 
this reason I look at pictures of 
trebuchets with slings as “artist’s 
concepKtions” that picture an idea 
rather than reality. 

The final type of siege engine, 
Fig. 11, went under names like 
espringale, espringold or spring- 
arde. Here the energy was stored 
by bending a piece of wood which, 
when released, would strike a 
heavy spear and propel it over a 
range comparable to that of other 
such devices. It probably could 




not be aimed well, but it had the 
advantage that it was easy to 
build on the spot. The armorer 
only had to carry a rope, a winch 
with ratchet and a slip -hook, and 
the spears, of course. But this was 
the only type of siege engine 
which resembled the bow and the 
crossbow in function by storing 
the energy in bending wood. The 
torsion engines, though they re- 
sembled crossbows in appearance 
were something different. But 
the crossbow probably took its 
shape from them; the first cross- 
bows indubitably were just extra 
heavy bows mounted on a stock. 

The gastrophetes of Ktesibios 
is the earliest example of which 
we have documentary evidence. 
But the crossbow did not become 
important until more than a thou- 
sand years later when somebody, 
flexing a fine sword, thought of 
substituting a steel bow for the 
wooden one. — ^WILLY LEY

ipvt. 1st Class Henry Cassidy 
viewed . a substance in his 
soup. 

‘‘Might be rubber.” He brushed 
an army of flies away for closer 
inspection. “Or mule. Or a piece 
of shoe. 

“My God!” he yelled. “I’m 
tired of this! Crawlin’ through 
the stinkin’ jungle. With the fe- 
ver, the bugs and garbage to 
eat! All over Korea, the Mekong 
Delta, and now South America. 
Why can’t the big shots not bo- 
ther poor devil’s that’ve got six 
kids?” 

Cassidy dumped his soup and 
jumped on its pannikin. 

This act of subversion was ob- 



served by Mstr. Sgt. Lawrence 
Smith, dog-robber to Capt. Tim,- 
othy Haggerty of the U.S.A.F. 
The sergeant was given to think- 
ing. The more he thought the 
more he found worth thinking 
about. He had four kids and a 
bullet in his left leg somewhere. 

Capt. Haggerty’s plane was 
shot from under him that day. 
He reached camp by crawling 
miles through swamps and cane 
fields, dodging alligators and 
sharpshooters the while. That 
night, as he helped Haggerty 
change from a mud-soaked uni- 
form, Sgt. Smith talked. 

“It’s not too wild a dream, 
sir,” he concluded, knees quak- 





ing. ‘‘Senator Tom Walsh of 
Montana once suggested the 
same thing.” 

Haggerty should have had the 
sergeant courtmartialed, but he 
was too exhausted. He held out a 
badly scratched hand instead. 

At breakfast, Tim Haggerty 
banged the table, achieved si- 
lence, dismissed the waiters, 
locked the mess hall door, and 
made a proposal. At first his fel- 
low officers listened in puzzled 
silence. Soon their jaw muscles 
tightened. A few jumped to their 
feet. 

The time had come for dra- 
matics. Haggerty tossed a lock of 
sandy hair out of his eyes, un- 
buckled his pistol holster, and 
tossed it among the coffee cups. 

“Who cares whether the new 
American frontier is at the Rio 
Grande, the Isthmus of Panama 
or the River Plate?” he said 
quietly. “Who the hell asked for 
this war anyway?” 

He answered his question with 
four-letter words, repeated the 
answer, and finally told his lis- 
teners what the answer had been. 

“Let those responsible fight it 
out,” he shouted. “Let’s get out 
of this sweating hell. Are you 
with me?” 

“Treason!” blurted a white- 
faced second looie. 

“Poetic justice!” whooped a 
sunburned veteran of four un- 
declared wars. “We can’t lick the 



damned spicks any more’n they 
can lick us. This will be a trial 
by combat, like in the Middle 
Ages when things got deadlocked. 
I’m for it.” 

“Louis Pinedo runs the Bra- 
zilo -Argentine circus,” a third 
flyer cut in. “His men think he’s 
Dios^s little brother. Let’s see 
what he says.” 

S everal hours later a dozen U.S. 

jets headed for the upper 
Amazon on a tip wangled from 
Intelligence. They spotted Pine- 
do’s scarlet fighter. They forced 
it to land. 

Haggerty approached the ship, 
forelock aslant. 

“@ue passe, hombre?^* Pinedo 
inquired as he clambered out of 
the cockpit, hands in air. (He 
was chubby and blond; not the 
dashing lady killer Tim had ex- 
pected.) 

Haggerty told him. 

Pinedo considered until his 
cigarette burned stained finger- 
tips. 

“Bueno.'” 

“December 15?” 

“jBxce//enfe.” 

“Junction of the Rios Brazos 
and Amazon?” 

^'Porque no?"' 

“Keep in touch, Capiian. Sor-

“De nada.^* The Argentine 
bowed grandly. Tim realized he 
might be a lady killer after all. 



THE LAST FILIBUSTER

S enate and House were in night 
session on December 15, 
struggling to provide more guns 
and butter before the Christ- 
mas recess. 

Helicopters drifted over the 
Capitol. Pedestrians paid little 
attention. Eggbeaters were com- 
mon sights, particularly since 
they had been retired from the 
front after proving too vulnerable 
to sharpshooters. 

At midnight, Haggerty tossed 
a bomb into the Senate cham- 
ber. Sgt. Smith did likewise in 
the House. Both missiles released 
puffs of smoke. 

Congressmen panicked and 
flung themselves against locked 
corridor doors. A few rushed the 
visitors’ galleries. They wilted 
on the stairs or as they beat on 
carved panels. 

Lights snapped. Helicopters 
landed softly on snow. Men in 
gas masks hopped out with 
stretchers. They stowed the re- 
laxed legislators. In ten minutes 
the squadron had sped south- 
ward with a great rattling. 

When the FBI, CIA and SS 
came out of shock they found the 
White House also raided during 
a late cabinet meeting. 

The first horrified reaction was 
that the Spaniards were at the 
door, as the British once had 
been. Soon, however, word fil- 
tered from Buenos Aires that 
similar raids had been made on 



the Casa Rosada and the head- 
quarters of the Organization of 
American States. 

There was nmning to and fro 
by the Establishments. Politi- 
cians raved. A-bomb threats were 
heard once more. But both arm- 
ies remained bivouacked near the 
Equator. 

Gradually the populace of two 
continents began to chuckle as 
the Smith-Haggerty-Pinedo plan 
dawned on Men in the Streets. 
The Yankee sense of humor was 
tickled past bearing. Latin Am- 
ericans were convulsed. Even 
those who might have rallied in 
support of the status quo talked, 
instead, about another Battle of 
the Century. 

The smiling conspirators had 
miles of bleachers built in that 
green valley where the Brazos 
and the Amazon meet. Refri- 
gerated river boats brought end- 
less tons of food and drink. 
Transport and hotel facilities 
were arranged. Bullet-proof 
shields were erected to protect 
spectators. 

Seats soon were selling at 
scalpers’ prices. Even blase Eur- 
opeans and recently ' bruised 
Asiatics contributed their share 
of ticket money. Africans tried to 
stand aloof but eventually were 
caught up in the spirit of the 
thing. The Inter-American War, 
which had cost billions and tak- 
en 100,000 lives, was turned over-

night into the greatest sporting 
event since Nero. 

C ame the dawn of Washing- 
ton’s Birthday. 

“Fair, hot and humid,” said 
the Weather Man in Rio. 

“By rigid training,” Haggerty 
announced over a worldwide TV 
hookup, “each team has reduced 
its total weight by nearly five 
tons. Their original uniforms 
have had to be discarded because 
they became so large at the belt- 
lines. The U. S. team favored 
this change until it was learned 
that their opponents also would 
get new outfits. Then they claim- 
ed a foul. However, a Book of 
Rules prepared by Hank Cassi- 
dy provides that no competitor 
shall be handicapped by excess 
equipment, such as 100-pound 
packs, for example, so the claim 
was disallowed. 

“Now it will be exactly 10 
a.m., when you hear the time 
tone. The great moment has 
come. A thousand intrepid war- 
riors, if we include Legislative 
and Administrative Assistants for 
each solon, are taking the field. 

“The Yankees are in blue 
walking shorts and crash helm- 
ets; the Latins in gold-bordered 
serapes and sombreros. They are 
armed, all according to the Book 
of Rules, with sawed-off shot- 
guns, cattle prods, tear gas 
bombs, machetes, bolas, black- 



jacks, rusty cavalry sabers, jacS 
handles and switchblade ImiveS. 

“Marching ahead of their re- 
spective armies came President 
Wilfred Manchester Jones and 
Presidente Ernesto Blanco-Ma- 
chado. They have met in the cen- 
ter of the field. They’re shak- 
ing hands. They seem to be whis- 
pering together. Just a moment, 
ladies and gentlemen of the 
worldwide television audience, 
until I can find out exactly what’s 
going on . 

“There’s been a slight delay,” 
Tim reported some minutes later. 
“President Jones has asked per- 
mission to make a speech. Ref- 
eree Pinedo is consulting the 
Book of Rules . He’s nodding 
... A filibuster is in the making, 
I fear . Yes. That’s right. 
The next voice you hear will be 
that of the President of the 
United States of North Ameri- 
ca. 

White mane flowing in the 
pampas wind, Jones poured forth 
oratory through countless loud- 
speakers. For five long minutes 
he was listened to. Then a quar- 
ter of a million sweating bleach- 
erites yelled for action. 

When the President ran out 
of breath and saliva the Presi- 
dente demanded equal time on 
the network. Pinedo and Hag- 
gerty conferred anxiously in front 
of the cameras, then spread their 
hands. Equal time? Sacrosanct!

of the United Nations. The Sec Gen was a Ugandan, 

Young Harmish had long been N.K. Mboto, a former puisne 
a blip on the ARC Light, as it judge of the High Court at Kam- 
had been named for its Ameri- pala. Mboto kept peace by run- 



89 




ning the world by the book and 
fining the hell out of anybody 
who messed around with what 
he had come to consider his-by- 
God Charter. 

Mboto spoke and swore fluent- 
ly in Russian, Mandarin and mid- 
Atlantic English, and the ARC 
countries’ rulers were frankly 
afraid of him. It was no wonder, 
then, that they, not to mention 
Britain, Cuba, Paraguay and most 
of the others, had given up their 
sovereignty and put their trust 
and safekeeping in the hands 
of an incredibly strengthened 
United Nations. 

Though Young Harmish did 
not know of the ARC Light, he 
was linked to the Auxorean 
equivalents, the ethervid and the 
spyfax. By using them to study 
Earth fashions, Y. Harmish had 
familiarized himself with every 
detail of terrestrial costuming. 

Now he summoned garments 
out of the fabroid machine and 
put them on. In the mirror, he 
saw himself as the very embodi- 
ment of a dashing Earth-style 
blade. His high, hard collar glis- 
tened. His slim-jim four-in-hand 
was pierced by a diamond stick- 
pin. His belt-in-back jacket was 
stylishly leather-patched at el- 
bows and cuffs, and his knickers 
draped fashionably over clocked 
woolen stockings which were set 
off by buckled oxfords. His pleat- 
ed white-on-white ^irt shone; 

90 



and his derby hat, from which 
grew a long Tyrolean feather, sat 
jauntily on his head. 

What Y. Harmish had failed to 
realize, of course, was that while 
he was in hyperspace the well- 
known krono effect had come in- 
to play, distorting the eras. The 
fashions he had seen were a mish- 
mash of the centuries, as if Men’s 
Wear Magazine had been af- 
flicted with incurable nostalgia 
and Vo^ue with deja va. 

Satisfied with himself, Yoimg 
Harmish gave a final glance at 
the landing coordinates, took up 
his London-rolled umbrella and 
strode to the exit. He stepped 
out on the campus of a imiversity 
whose students lately had been 
described as stokers of a hotbed 
of social action. Plan One was 
afoot. 

T hree days later, after a series 
of frustrations that left him 
more convinced than ever that 
Mboto was the man his planet 
needed, Harmish gave up his pre- 
liminary skirmishing and flew to 
the slablike building on the East 
River in New York. He felt it 
was time to go to the top. 

Harmish parked a few feet over 
the north flowerbed and headed 
for the front door, of the Secre- 
tariat Building, where a tanned, 
lean young man was about to go 
in. 

Harmish bowed and said : “My 

GALAXY 




pardon extends to you, sir, but 
these are the Untied Nations?*' 
He knew the English remarkably, 
he felt. 

The man he addressed moved 
his gaze up from Harmish's shoes, 
knickers and pleated shirt to his 
feathered derby, then back to the 
pleasantly boyish, smiling face. 

‘‘These are they,” the man said. 
“What are you, the Shangri-La 
delegation?” 

“Negatively. Auxor, to which I 
am, does not yet represent itself 
at the Untied Nations, disfortun- 
ately. Savvy?” 

“I guess, so pal. My name’s 
Scally. Just get in?” 

“Momentarily, Scally-sir. Yes, 
I-Harmish have made arrival. 
Young Harmish, to elongate. Re- 
lict of Late Harmish, the father, 
and Old Harmish, grandsir. 
Auxorean appelatory custom.” 

‘^Good for you, son,” Scally 
said. “Look, do you have to pre- 
sent your credentials to Mboto 
right away? How about a little 
drink to celebrate your safe arri- 
val? Being a native, I may be in 
a position to give you a few tips.” 

Harmish looked pleased. “De- 
liriously, sir.” He remembered 
an ad. “Yellow gin, perhaps. 
Distinguished quencher, it is writ- 
ten.” 

“Any color at all, pal,” ScaUy 
said. He steered Harmish past a 
guard with a wave of a press card 
and took him. up the escalator to 



the delegates lounge. “Yellow gin 
for my friend,” he told the barten- 
der, “and a brown bourbon for 
me.” 

Though Jim Scally had a de- 
bonair way he was known to his 
associates as a bitter man who 
drank more than was good for 
him. The folding of his paper 
was only the latest in a series of 
kicks in the teeth he’d received 
from life. A messy divorce earlier 
had left him paying endless ali- 
mony to a Tasmanian girl who’d 
won custody of their two children 
and who, by returning to her fam- 
ily home in Hobart, had effective- 
ly denied him visitation rights. 
These and a dozen other tough 
breaks were obviously what had 
driven Jim Scally to drink. 

A gentle conspiracy operated 
in Scally’s favor at the U. N. The 
conspirators included doormen, 
guards, press officers and rei)ort- 
ers and certain high-ranking 
members of the Secretariat. 

I f anybody was going to be tech- 
nical about it, Scally had lost 
his accreditation months ago 
when his newspaper went out of 
business, and no other news or- 
ganization hired him. He appar- 
ently was able to hang on by 
doing P.R. work and handling 
an occasional string assignment. 
Thanks to the conspiracy, he had 
the run of the U.N., including the 



bar. But the bar demanded cash. 
THEY HILARIATED WHEN I HYPERSPACED FOR EARTH 91 




‘I’ll get this one,” Scally said. 
“Unless — ” 

“Oh, I demand to pay,” Harm- 
ish said. “What currency employs 
itself at the Untied Nations — 
gold?” 

“No, no; good old United — 
Untied States dollars will do/^ 
“Dollars and pence, yes. 
Pounds, shillings and ounces. It 
returns itself to me now.” Harm- 
ish took out a thick wallet. 

“Not pounds, pal. That’s Eng- 
lish. A good old American ten- 
dollar bill would do the trick.” 
Harmish withdrew a ten -dollar 
bill, American. 

Presently, as a Trusteeship 
Council meeting ended and in- 
creasing numbers of people lined 
the bar, the two moved to a table 
at the side, Harmish with a sec- 
ond gin and Scally with his third 
bourbon. 

Scally said: “Harmish, pal, I’ve 
got to straighten you out. You 
have no idea of the complexity 
of New York life. You need a 
first secretary to handle your 
business and social affairs.” 

Harmish was quick to agree. “I 
nominate you secretary-wallah.” 
“I accept,” Scally said as 
promptly. “But before we go into 
the petty details — salary, ex- 
pense account, bonuses — I’d 
better know more about you so 
you get our money’s worth. 
First, exactly where is Auxor?” 
“Auxor coextends the land mass 

GALAXY 



of my planet. Water encroaches 
all remaining.’^ 

Scally swallowed some bourbon 
as if to help him grasp the con- 
cept. ‘Wou mean Auxor is a — a 
planet? You mean you came here 
in a — a spaceship, like astro- 
nauts — cosmonauts?” 

“Having spyfaxed same, im- 
doubtably,” Harmish said. 

“It figures,” Scally said, re-ex- 
amining the assortment of cloth- 
ing the other wore so proudly. 
“You came alone?” 

“Solely Harmish. They hilari- 
ated when I hyperspaced for 
Earth. They disparaged so minor 
a terminus. ‘Nobody Earthwards,’ 
they snickerly advised. ‘Is back- 
water of Galaxy,’ they scornheap- 
ed. But Harmish, of perseverent 
bent, pioneerized. Bottoms up, 
Soally-sir.” 

“Mud in your eye. So you’re 
a spaceman, Harmish! I’ll be 
damned. The funny thing is, I be- 
lieve you. Every sockeyed kill- 
able — cockeyed syllable.” 

A n incredibly beautiful girl 
came in with members of an 
Asian delegation. “Enchantment,” 
Harmish said. 

“Depends on your point of 
view,” Scally said. “Once I mar- 
ried the stenographer to an over- 
seas delegation. Disenchantment. 
Are you married, Harmish?” 

“Uxoriously, sir, to every eligi- 
ble woman.” 



“Whoa!” Scally said. “How 
could that be?” 

“By means of the sexually per- 
vasive interconsciousness effect, 
acron5rmed SPI CE.” 

“SPICE is good. Acronym is 
better. You read all their minds, 
know all their sensations?” 

Harmish wriggled. “Exactly. 
Who needs marriage?” 

“Some do, sometimes, even if 
burned once. How does this 
SPICE effect work?” 

“All Auxoreans are mentally 
joined,” Harmish said. “The well 
known mindlink. In addition, the 
male-female link works like your 
country’s Operation Match.” 
“You mean the computer that 
finds two young people of similar 
interests?” 

“The same. But in Auxor all 
is done by mentality.” 

“Is every male linked to every 
female?” 

“Please! No barbarians we! 
Only non-marrieds. Once a com- 
patibility has been established 
and marriage consummated, or 
an extramarital relationship con- 
tracted, the partners are taken 
off the SPICE shelf, so to speak.” 
“Then you’re not married, ex- 
cept in this SPICE way?” 

“To exactize, no. One day, 
when the conditions are right, and 
our antennas are attuned, the 
contact will be made and I too 
will have been eliminated from 
eligibility. I’ll have found a wife.”

‘‘Meanwhile you’re getting the 
message from all these gorgeous 
dames? How does it feel?” 
Harmish wriggled again as his 
attention was called to the sensa- 
tion. “Impossibly describable. 
Let me show.” And he handed 
Scally a metallic skullcap. “This 
connects you with Intergal.” 
“Intergal?” 

“Intergalactic Transmissions. 
Being Auxorean, I imrequire ar- 
tificial aids, but for you a boost- 
er.” 

II 

S cally carefully put the skull- 
cap on the back of his head, 
where it seemed to grip his scalp 
with a half dozen little fingers. 
There was a rush of overpower- 
ing sensation, as if the sky and 
everything in it were falling di- 
rectly on him. Then this eased, 
and he felt as if he were standing 
on a tall cliff overlooking the sea. 

It was a sea of women, and 
their hair was the waves. They 
seemed to be standing, facing 
him, their eyes fixed on his with 
intense interest. He felt that even 
if he could make out a face on 
the far horizon, he’d be able to 
see clearly into her eyes. 

The long hair of these myriads 
of standing, waiting women, mov- 
ing in the li^t wind, was of many 
colors and tones and heightened 
the illusion that he was at the 

94 



edge of thQ sea. An intoxicating 
perfume cr^t jjifi cliff to him, 
and there was sileiice except in 
his mind. 

Th^e, voices spoEe tenderly, 
passionately, inquiringlly, wonder- 
ingly. But he thought he also 
recognized some voices similar 
to a particular one he had known : 
aloof, disdainful, belittling. With 
a shudder he shut these out. For 
a moment it was as if he had 
been in contact with Hobart, 
Tasmania. 

Then James Franklin Scal- 
ly heard/felt/received/knew her. 
One in the multitude was coming 
through to him. Jim Scally tin- 
gled with a thrill of appreciation, 
almost of recognition. 

She bathed him in comfort. She 
warmed him in the corridors of 
his heart which had long been 
ice. Could this be the girl he’d al- 
ways wanted? 

Impossible. A quirk of inter- 
stellar communication. A sensa- 
tion arranged by a stranger who 
perhaps was an enemy. He tried 
to put the feeling away. He was 
getting soft. But he didn’t remove 
the metallic skullcap. 

There was a phrase: Fve been 
looking for you! and he didn’t 
know whether she had said it, or 
he, or both. 

He knew then that he had been 
looking for her — in all the wrong 
places. In New York and London 
and Brazzaville. In Moscow and 

GALAXY 




Peking and Dar es Salaam. In 
Kodiak and Kuwait and Tel 
Aviv. In all the places the news 
had taken him. And now for the 
first time he’d looked beyond 
Earth and had found her. 

Across the vastness her pres- 
ence came. An aura. No, it was a 
name — Aura. He had an im- 
pression of slimness, of young ex- 
citement tempered with maturity, 
of fine-boned beauty, of yearning. 

She was youth and light and 
hope, an end to searching. His 
impression of a sea of women had 
yielded a single isle of peace, of 
love deep and enduring .... 

And all that was wrong with it 
was that it was impossible. 

T Te deliberately broke the con- ' 
tact, snatching off the skull- 
cap. Aura lingered in his mind 
for a moment, then was gone. 

What a hoax! “Intergal” in- 
deed! Scally dismissed her for the 
phantom she was by swallowing 
the remains of his drink and loud- 
ly demanding another. **My so- 
lace comes in whiskey glasses,” 
he said and handed the skullcap 
back to Harmish. 

The alien shrugged. ‘‘Reject her 
if you like, but not me.” Maybe 
it was the drink, it seemed to 
Scally that there were times when 
Harmish’s speech was more 
idiomatic than quaint. 

“Leaving the women out of it,” 

Scally said brusquely, “do you 

THEY HILARIATED WHEN I HYPERSPACED FOR EARTH 




mean you don’t know what it is 
to be alone in your mind — to 
have privacy of thought?” 

‘‘Never alone,” Harmish said. 
^‘The global Auxorean conscious- 
ness comfortingly extends beyond 
the stars. They speak to me con- 
stantly, and I to them.” 

“That must be maddening.” 
“You do not tire of yourself, I 
assume, and we do not tire of 
ourselves. It is the Auxorean way 
of life.” 

“I guess it beats television.” 
“You’ve absoluted it,” Harm- 
ish said. “Take another drink. 
We commence to be brothers be- 
yond the stars.” 

Harmish and Scally drank. The 
alien looked calculatingly at the 
Earthman and said : “As brothers, 
let me desist you from the idea 
that I peacebound come. Au con- 
traire.” 

“Au confra/re?” Scally said. He 
appeared to be quite awash. 
“Bent on conquest, are you? 
Good. There’s been too much 
noodling around, peacewise. I’ll 
help you. If there was a war I 
could be a correspondent. Always 
wanted to be a war correspondent 
but never got the chance. No war, 
you know.” 

“How sad. But war is not my 
purpose. My aim is to take away 
your Secretary-General.” 

“Oh, that’s a good one,” Scally 
said admiringly. “Kidnap Mboto. 
Snatch him right out of his own 

96 



front yard. That’s sure one daring 
plan, fellow conspirator.” 

Harmish nodded. He’d done in- 
tensive research, he said, in eval- 
uating Mboto’s credentials, and 
was convinced that the Sec Gen 
was the only man who could 
solve the Auxoreans’ crisis. 

“Tell me more,” Scally said, 
drinking up. 

S o Harmish told him about his 
campus visit and his subse- 
quent trip to two Central Ameri- 
can countries. He admitted rue- 
fully that he’d been misled by the 
ethervid and spyfax about the 
extent of the campus “revolt.” 
The word obviously had different 
connotations on the campus and 
in Latin America. 

It had also been Young Harm- 
ish’ s intention on the campus to 
take advantage of alienation, 
which was making one of its 
periodic comebacks, as a pilot 
project for his larger plan. Young 
Harmish, by definition an alien, 
was naturally encouraged. Who 
was more fitted than alien he to 
lead a revolt of the alienated — 
this potent lot of potential lead- 
ers? 

But Young Harmish, despite 
he cries of “C/huru.'”, “Fre/he/f.'” 
and “Up the rebels!”, was cut 
dead on the campus. His message, 
unaccompanied by song or electric 
guitar and minus the big ampli- 
fied beat, was obviously in the 

GALAXY 




wrong bag. The few who did heai: 
told him politely, without empa- 
thy, that he wasn’t what was 
happening; at least not to them. 

In fact one shaggy young man, 
to whom Y. Harmish confided a 
plan to storm the Administration 
Building, told him: ‘‘My God, 
man, we’re not that alienated!” 
Besides, the shaggy young man 
added, this was dead week; peo- 
ple were cramming for final ex- 
ams. The student had also told 
him: “You talk funny, man.” 

Hurt and puzzled but persever- 
ing, Harmish had flown from the 
campus to the Central American 
nation of Baranoia, whose leader 
was the tyrant Lopez-Diaz. Bara- 
noia was on the border of another 
bothersome little country called 
Paranoohe, whose leader was the 
dictator Avila-Perez. 

Harmish was received courte- 
ously by Lopez-Diaz, who took 
him to a cafe in the square of 
the capital city. 

The Baranoians, Who had been 
rehearsed, cheered and sang when 
Lopez-Diaz appeared in the 
square with his guest and con- 
tinued to cheer as they went in- 
to the cafe and reappeared on 
the balcony, where they could 
dine in privacy. They began their 
meal with Rob Ro 5 ts. Lopez-Diaz 
did not drink the local wine; he 
used virtually none of the shoddy 
native products. 

The ceremonial cheering ended. 



The typical street noises of a 
Latin American capital in fer- 
ment rose to their ears. The con^ 
versation on the balcony was 
punctuated by sounds of breaking 
glass, gunshots. Chanting, sirens 
and an occasional scream. 

TT ncouraged by the obvious un- 
rest, Harmish waited only un- 
til the second round of Rob Roys 
to offer the use of an Auxorean 
bomb to Lopez-Diaz. 

(Scally wanted to know about 
the bomb. Harmish said it wasn’t 
much — jiist a Class 3 reservoir- 
digger, with a radiation trap that 
collected all the bad Geigers and 
jettisoned them perpendicularly 
into space. It had been Harmish’s 
larger plan, he confided, to test 
Mboto’s reaction to a crisis. If 
Mboto dealt with it adequately, 
Harmish would then make his 
move.) 

The Baranoian leader appear- 
ed to give very careful considera- 
tion to the offer of the bomb 
and what might lie behind it. 
Finally he said: “You ask me, 
senor, whether I will drop your 
bomb on the capital of my hated 
rival, Avila-Perez of Paranoche? 
Whether, in the vernacular of the 
Norteamericano, I will put my 
money where my mouth is?” 

Harmish, excited to eloquence, 
said: “That is precisely the ask 
I put to you.” 

Lopez-Diaz hesitated a mo- 

97 



THEY HILARIATED WHEN I HYPERSPACED FOR EARTH 




ment longer, then said decisively: 
‘Alas, the answer must be no.” 

Harmish was stunned. “You 
decline because you unwish to 
/isit such suffering on fellow hu- 
man beings?” 

LfOpez-Diaz snorted. “There 
Isn’t a humanitarian bone in my 
I)ody. My reason is simple: I 
fear Mboto.” 

“An ignoble answer,” Harmish 
'/ouchsafed peevishly. 

“Perhaps. But consider my po- 
sition and that of my hereditary 
enemy, Avila-Perez. We have 
much in common, as we learned 
when we met by chance in a 
night club in New York. Avila- 
Perez and I discussed our nearly 
identical problems at the club 
and later at the home of two 
'adies, and again in the U.N. bar 
during a recess of the internation- 
al conference that had taken us 
north.” 

“And you concluded?” 

“That the world is big enough 
for both of us, considering the 
presence in it also of Mboto — 
Mboto the savage-once-removed, 
the saint-and-destroyer, who 
would not hesitate to eliminate 
either or both of our countries to 
prevent more extensive destruc- 
tion. That Mboto is one to be 
feared and admired. A practical 
man first, an idealist second.” 

Harmish showed his disap- 
pointment. He said: “These can- 
not be the words of Lopez-Diaz, 

98 



the Protector of Baranoia, as I 
have heard him called, the noto- 
rious Latam dictator who threa- 
tens night and day to obliterate 
the oppressor, to counterinvade 
the Commie foe, to inquisit the 
infiltrator.” 

‘Look, senor, I talk big but I 
don’t want war. Mboto’d kill me 
— literally. I’m just an old-fash- 
ioned rabble rouser whose way 
is to. exhort the populace now 
and then to make them feel better 
about being poorer than the peo- 
ple of Paranoche. Mboto under- 
stands this. Meanwhile he and 
the U.N. are helping us catch up 
with Paranoche by sending ma- 
chinery and medicine, technicians 
and teachers and others who seem 
genuinely concerned about us.” 
He shrugged. “This appeals to 
my romantic nature. You can’t 
fight love.” 

Frustrated, Harmish said: “I 
will offer my bomb to Avila- 
Perez to drop on Baranoia.” 

Lopez-Diaz laughed. “He will 
tell you the same as I, my friend. 
He too stands in mortal fear of 
that sweet but murderous peace- 
keeper, Mboto.” 

A nd Avila-Perez did tell Harm- 
ish the same, too, in the most 
courteous way, when the alien 
flew to the capital of Paranoche 
in the private plane of Lopez- 
Diaz as a distinguished, if dis- 
comfited, guest of The Protector. 

GALAXY 




Avila -Perez told him Mboto for- 
tunately understood that the hor- 
rendous threats Avila-Perez made 
again Baranoia were for inter- 
nal consumption. He also said 
that he, Avila-Perez, much as he 
liked Harmish and appreciated 
his offer, would have him put to 
death before he would risk the 
possibility of conflict with Bar- 
anoia. 

Harmish expressed consterna- 
tion. 

“And well you might,” the 
leader of Paranoche said. “I ex- 
pressed similar consternation, my 
friend, when for some niinor pec- 
cadillo of mine Mboto blacked us 
out for a week. Utter quarantine. 
I didn't know there was such a 



thing. Some offshoot of the ARC 
Light did it. No communications 
of any kind witii the rest of the 
world. Demoralizing, like solitary 
confinement.” 

“When?” Harmish asked. 

“Three years ago. Then just 
as the quarantine was lifted we 
were hit by Hurricane Hildy. 
With no warning from the U.N. 
weather service, or anywhere else, 
there was no chance to get the 
crop in early. So naturally, be- 
cause we're a one- crop economy 
and because that crop equals 
thirty per cent of own gross na- 
tional product, we were knocked 
flat on our economic backs for 
longer than I care to remember. 
Mboto doesn’t fool around. He

scares the pants off me, if you 
want to know the whole truth, 
and I refuse to give him any ex- 
cuse to make an example of me.” 
‘‘You admit cowardice?” Harm- 
ish asked. 

“I’m a live coward,” Avila- 
Perez told him.“Whpt I am say- 
ing to you, with all due respect, 
is go peddle your bomb to some 
other slob. This one knows better 
than to tangle with the Sec Gen.” 
Harmish left Paranodhe and, 
in a thoughtful mood, headed for 
New York, home of the United 
Nations and of Mboto, its Secre- 
tary-General. 

Ill 

I t was almost like a stage en- 
trance. Harmish had just fin- 
ished describing his Latin-Ameri- 
can fiascoes to Scally in the U.N. 
bar when the Sec Gen came in 
alone and joined them. 

Mboto had never been one to 
stay aloof in his luxury quarters 
high atop the Secretariat Build- 
ing. He roamed all parts of his 
domain like a fearless and friend- 
ly but awesome lord. 

He sat down with Harmish and 
Scally and told a waiter who 
rushed over: “Two more of the 
same for these gentlemen and a 
Bloody (pardon the expression. 
Steward, I see you are British) 
Mary for me.” 

“No offense taken. Your Ex- 

100 



cellency,” the waiter said and 
went off to the service bar. 

Scally started to get up re- 
spectfully, but a powerful black 
hand pushed him down into his 
chair. “A new face in our midst?” 
the Sec Gen asked. “An imagma- 
tive new costume, anyway. Some- 
body must have invented time 
travel; he looks 19th century.” 
“He’s an alien,” Scally said. 
“We’re all aliens here,” Mboto 
said. “Even you in what you call 
your country, you breaker of 
pacts with the Red Man.” 
“Touche, Chief,” Scally said. 
“I don’t defend our lousy past.” 
“You should avoid calling an 
African ‘Chief,’ ” the Sec Gen 
said. “He may be sensitive about 
his tribal background.” 

Scally grinned as the waiter 
came with the drinks. “It’s a 
fact. Harmish is literally an 
alien, from an extraterr — from 
deep in space, like.” 

“If that’s journalese,” Mboto 
said, “you speak it with a quaint 
descriptive flavor.” 

“It’s not journalese. It’s just 
that if you’d drunk as much 
Bourbon as I have, your theech 
might be spick, too.” 

Mboto turned to Harmish. 
“You can tell that our waspish 
friend here is subconsciously a 
minority-hater. Spick, indeed. 
Let’s introduce ourselves. I’m 
Mboto, Secretary-General of the 
United Nations.” 



GALAXY 




''Untied Nations,” Scally mut- 
tered, slumping. 

Harmish beamed across the 
table. ‘'Exhilarated, sir. You are 
the he I have light-yeared to ac- 
quaintance. I, Y. Harmish, re- 
lict of but revanent to, one hopes, 
Auxor. In truth an alien, but 
adaptable, I vouchsafe.” 

“Maybe we should close the 
bar,” Mboto said. “It’s raising 
hell with the language.” 

“Humor?” Harmish asked, 
straining. “Irony? I limp behind, 
uncomprehensive.” 

“Your candor does your credit. 
What brought you across the 
trackless void?” 

Scally muttered : “Trackless, 

hell. Harmish, he track’um. Lord. 
Big wheel back home, Harmish 
be.” 

“And honored here as well, 
Scally. I think we close’um bar, 
though; you drinkum too much 
firewater. My word, tongue blong 
along you, him flappum too much 
altogether.” 

“Big kidder. I hope,” Scally 
said, subsiding. 

'"T^he Sec Gen turned back to 
^ Harmish, who had been list- 
ening with agonized attention, and 
asked: “What did bring you 

across the void, trackless or other- 
wise, which we primitives of 
Earth have yet to probe in 
depth?” 

“An unworthy motive, perhaps. 



now that you have impinged on 
me with favor,” Harmish said. 
He took out of his breast pocket 
a curious device and held it 
toward the Sec Gen. “All sin- 
cere, I display this.” 

“You must be as drunk as 
Scally,” Mboto said. 

“Negatively. Alcohol fails to 
permeate one of my metabolic 
type. The grains but convert 
themselves to energy potential, 
known on Auxor as Enerpo.” 

The Sec Gen said: “You seem 
to have the advantage of me, if 
only linguistically. But, having 
seized yourself of the situation, 
as we diplomatic types say, you 
must have an agenda. What is 
your pleasure, Mr. Chairman?” 
Harmish rolled his eyes. “Dis- 
tract me not,” he said. “My pleas- 
ure awaits my return to Auxor. 
My duty is another thing — the 
abduction of you.” 

“Foolhardy adventure,” Mboto 
said. “I have only to lift an eye- 
brow, and hidden guards who 
watch my every fnovement will 
reap you like so much wheat. 
Will you reconsider, Y. Harmish? 
Or must the first interstellar alien 
be a dead alien?” 

Harmish seemed unafraid. 
“Perhaps you misunderstand. 
What points itself at you is no 
weapon except in the economic 
sense. Y. Harmish offers no vio- 
lence but — a job. That which 
you have mistaken as a weapon 

101 



THEY HILARIATED WHEN I HYPERSPACED FOR EARTH 




is tiie Auxorean equivalent of 
your phenomenon yclept credit 
card. But with exception that no 
statement presents itself. Phe- 
nomenon is portable programmer 
of plenty. Wish-fulfillment de- 
vice. Translator of dreams.” 

It was then that Harmish ex- 
plained in 'his quaint way that 
he was offering the Secretary 
Generalship of Auxor to Mboto 
because Auxor was adrift in in- 
decision, mediocrity, apathy, an- 
omie, apartness (‘‘Just don’t 
call it Apartheid,” the Sec Gen 
said) and other modern mani- 
festations that were threatening 
to plunge it into a new dark age, 
or worse, into oblivion. 

“Sounds hke Earth, pre- 
Mboto,” Scally said. “Why not 
use your own Enerpo gadget to 
fix things up?” 

Harmish sighed. Then, with 
fetching modesty he explained 
that he had tried — that he him- 
self was the equivalent of the 
Secretary- General of Auxor. He 
paused for reaction, but the 
others merely waited for him to 
go on. 

^hagrined, Harmish said the 
^ universal mindlink nullified 
the effect of any device, mechan- 
ical or psychological, that an 
Auxorean — even he — might 
use against another. 

Harmis'h said: “True, Auxor’s 
most active minds are hereditar- 

102 



ily immune to the mindlink, but 
they languish in durance, along 
with their owners. The gumption 
people, the vital ones, go to jail. 
The rest are a lot of sorries, 
apathetic, unimaginative.” 

“But surely there are those 
whose energy is channeled pro- 
ductively,” Mboto said. “Those 
who have made scientific, medi- 
cal, artistic advances.” 

“Nothing is artistic about 
Auxor any more. Anyone with an 
idea knows it will be instantly 
absorbed into the mass conscious- 
nes. It would be as if — name 
one of your planet’s great works, 
widely copied — ” 

“Mona Lisa, David ...” 
“Perfectly. As if the Da Vinci 
or the Michelangelo, coextensive- 
ly with the moment of its com- 
pletion, was already globally 
copied. As if a googolplex of re- 
productions came into being 
simultaneously. Incentive is des- 
troyed.” 

“I can see that,” Mboto said; 
“but what could I possibly do 
about it?’^ 

“Yours is a powerful mind. 
We’ve tasted it, imknown to you. 
We foimd its power suprawestern, 
supraglobal; it transcends that of 
civilized man’s; it has potentiali- 
ties unexplored by you or your 
fellow men. Your mind is strong 
enough to share itself with a 
selected number of Auxoreans, as 
an experiment; to inspire them to 

GALAXY 




rise from torpor; to infect them 
with Mbotolike dignity and ego; 
to show that a tribal man, whose 
concepts were those of the group, 
could grow to be a supremely in- 
dividual person, an artist of man- 
kind/’ 

Only a powerful alien mind, 
such as Mboto’s, screened against 
the Auxorean mindlink by its 
alien nature, could be effective, 
Harmish insisted with an elo- 
quence that again made him 
sound quite un-Harmishlike. 

It appealed to the savage in 
Mboto, who hadn’t had to smash 
a rebellion or destroy a dictator 
in a loon’s age. In a way it was 
unfortunate that he no longer had 
to worry about Earth. 

Mboto could leave the U.N. in 
good conscience, he knew. The 
world would be in hands as com- 
petent as his own. By unspoken 
arrangement, Mboto’s successor 
had already been picked and 
agreed to by the ARC nations 
and therefore ail others. 

The successor-designate was a 
strong-willed man with an ab- 
horrence to war as deep as his • 
own. A further asset was that he 
also represented a nonwhite race. 
He was a man called Ohiro 
Kashawa, who was born to radi- 
ation-crippled parents in 1945 in 
a target of opportunity called 
Hiroshima. Ohiro Kashawa was 
widely respected and popularly 
known as O.K. 



But there was an unfilled wan 
that Mboto had on Earth. 

A/rboto told Harmish: “Five 
years ago, I would havr 
been tempted. That was when j 
went out in public more oftei. 
than I do now. Occasionally i 
still found myself seated nex 
to the kitchen door in some fash 
ionable restaurant. But there’: 
been progress. Not giant strides, 
but an encouraging amount. 
Slowly I was accepted in these 
restaurants. Not because of my 
skin, mind you, but because of 
my position. Then I became more 
fashionable than the restaurants 
and the ‘in’ people began to eat 
where I ate, even at Spanish 
Charlie’s in East Harlem. I don’t 
eat out any more, at all. Now I 
have a bigger ambition than to 
sit comfortably in a restaurant.” 
This was news to ScaUy. 
“What’s that, sir?” he asked. 

Mboto looked as modest as 
Scally had ever seen him. The 
Sec Gen took a deep breath and 
said, looking down at the table: 
“I want to resign from the U.N., 
settle here and be the first Negro 
president of the United States.” 
There was a long silence. Then 
Scally asked: “How could that 
be? You’re not a citizen.” 

“I was bom in the U.S. Em- 
bassy in Kampala and had dual 
Uganda-U.S. citizenship until I 
was 18, when I chose to be a 

103 



THEY HILARIATED WHEN I HYPERSPACED FOR EARTH 







IV 



Ugandan. You forget that w*hen 
I became Secretary General the 
Congress of the United States 
restored my U.S. citizenship to 
me. Not honorary, but actual 
citizenship. I’m well over 35 and 
as fit to be president as you are, 
Scally, my fine white American 
friend.” 

“I remember now,” Scally said. 
^^But, still — ” 

^‘Still you question my mo- 
tives,” the Sec Gen said. “Is it 
more than vanity, you ask? I 
think it is. Look at the history 
of America’s dark-skinned people. 
Look where they grow up — Lit- 
tle Rock, Selma, Harlem, Watts. 
Look at the vast number of po- 
tential geniuses who never had a 
chance. Many have overcome 
handicaps of color or poverty to 
develop their talent. You know 
their names as well as I. But think 
of the thousands of other poten- 
tial geniuses who died — physi- 
cally or spiritually — because 
they never survived the misery 
and hopelessness of a Negro ghet- 
to.” 

“But if you were in the White 
House — ?” 

“Obviously,” Mboto said, “I’d 
be their inspiration. The begin- 
ning of fulfillment. Everything 
else would be detail.” 

Scally sat in silence, contemp- 
lating the future. 

“I’ll stay on Barth,” Mboto 
told Harmish. 

104 



'^he crestfallen Harmish said: 
“My crest has fallen. Is all 

lost? 

Mboto said: “You can’t have 
me or O.K., but I’d like to help 
you.” 

“You must help me,” Harmish 
pleaded. “All that I have des- 
cribed to you is secondary — 
something we could survive. The 
deeper threat is one I’ve been 
ashamed to tell. Asihamed for 
myself — my people.” 

“And what' is that?” Mboto 
asked kindly. “Forget your shame 
if hdp is possible.” 

“Sterility,” Harmish said. 

“Of course!” Scally said, com- 
ing to. “All those women — that 
sea of women I imagined I saw 
when I put on your skull cap.” 

“A symbol, merely,” Harmish 
said. 

“Sure, a symbol — a symptom 
of what’s wrong. Among the im- 
pressions I had was a lack of ful- 
fillment. An emptiness. A yearn- 
ing. Sure, they marry — but 
what’s the ultimate fulfillment 
for a woman? A child — children. 
The only eternity anyone can be 
sure of.” 

Harmish looked surprised. 
“You’ve absoluted it,” he said. 

“Right. They can’t, or won’t 
have children — ” 

“Can’t,” Harmish said. “Be- 
cause they despise their men. 

GALAXY 




They’re psychologically unable 
to bear . children in a world so 
sunk in mediocrity that it’d be a 
living death. They’d rather see 
the race die than perpetuate it 
as it is.” 

Scally subsided again. Mboto 
said: You’d like me to change 

all that? Alone? I’m flattered. I’ll 
match my virility with any man’s, 
but I don’t really think I’m up 
to repopulating a planet.” 

Harmish looked hurt. 

^'You misunderstand. I expect 
no insemination from you, unless 
you choose individually. We are 
monogamous.” 

“I joked where I should not 
have,” Mboto said. “It’s a serious 
matter. You need an expert to 
make an on-the-spot study and 
do whatever is necessary to shake 
them out of their skins. You need 
a renaissance — literally a re- 
birth. A born leader. A man with 
a passion for living. Someone to 
provide an example. But I’ve told 
you Why I can’t go. Take Scal- 
ly.” 

“Scally? Esteemed, but inef- 
fectual Scally?” 

“Don’t scornheap, Harmish,” 
Mboto said. “Scally can help you 
if any Earthman can. He’s tough 
enough to be ruthless, but he 
writes mystical, beautiful and 
often hopeful poetry. The Ham- 
marskjold influence, I except. 
There’s nothing in his personal 
life to keep him here, and it’s 



about time he had some happi- 
ness. I understand the Auxorean 
maidens are not to be sneezed 
at.” 

“Sneezed at?” Harmish asked. 

“Idiom. I mean they’re pretty 
swell, aren’t they? By and large?” 

“Swell? Large? They do. They 
are. In places. Yes.” 

“So take him. Just don’t tell 
the Security Council or the New 
York Times.” 

“But he lacks experience,” 
Harmish protested. 

A yrboto laughed. “He has more 
theoretical and practical ex- 
perience than Ohiro Kashawa and 
me combined. That means he’s an 
all-round expert in geopolitics, not 
to mention economics, linguistics, 
anthropology and psychology. He 
was the first Schweitzer Scholar 
at The Maxwell School. I’m sure 
he hasn’t told you he’s James 
Franklin Scally, Ph.D., summa 
cum laude, of the same class that 
produced a Secretary of State and 
a Governor of New York. Nor 
has he become a bum since. Don’t 
think he’s one-tenth as drunk or 
ineffectual as he may appear. Let 
me tell you a secret. Young 
Harmish, as one Secretary-Gener- 
al to another. I’ve been a party 
to your conversation with Scally 
since it began. There’s a micro- 
phone sewed into his lapel and a 
receiver elsewhere, as there al- 
ways is when Scally’s on a mis- 

105 



THEY HILARIATED WHEN I HYPERSPACED FOR EARTH 




sion. Not quite Auxor’s intercon- 
nected consciousness, but good 
enough for our purposes. Let me 
tell you another secret: 

“Scally is now and has been 
since I came here from Kampala 
the number three man in the 
United Nations, right after O.K. 
Only you and the three of us 
know it. This gave Scally the free- 
dom neither O.K. nor I had to 
talk to people in crises and to 
Unove relatively unnoticed to 
trouble spots. Scally's interven- 
tions, proposed by me to the 
Security Council but drafted by 
Scally, have settled half a dozen 
crises in the past five years. 

‘‘You may have heard of the 
abortive coup at Qatif. Or the in- 



cident of the Andalusian Fog. Or 
the short-lived Battle of the Land 
Bridge at Bering. Or the most ex- 
plosive of all, the Siege of Novaya 
Zemlya. Any of these could have 
erupted into a global war, an 
Earth- destroying war. But Scally 
flew to each. While he was dig- 
ging out the reportable facts for 
his paper, he gave the U.N. the 
unpublishable background and 
made his recommendations for a 
settlement. O.K. and I then went 
through the motions of acting on 
it, but it was really Scally’s solu- 
tion.’^ 

Y. Harmish looked with new re- 
spect at James- Franklin Scally, 
putative sot, who now grinned 
and said: “Who bespeaks me? 





What name blong along Scally- 
sir dost thou take in yain? An- 
other bourbon, Innkeeper, an you 
love me. I’ll go anywhere, at any 
lime, and talk to anyone in the 
interests of peace. Who else said 
that? Make it a double, Innkeep- 
er. One to get ready and two for 
the road.” 

‘‘He’s not nearly as non com- 
pos as he sounds,” Mboto said. 
“He is fairly sozzled but withal 
he’s literate, perceptive and fair- 
minded. He had too small a 
chance on Barth; terrestrial 
posterity passed him by until 
O.K. and I discovered him, and 
then we had to keep him a sec- 
ret to preserve his effectiveness. 
There may be thousands more 
like him, undiscovered; maybe 
we can find them. , Meanwhile 
let’s give Scally a chance to be 
himself on Auxor.” 

Harmish and Scally looked at 
each other with new eyes. 

“I guarantee him,” Mboto said. 

T).ack on Auxor then. Young 
Harmish asked the Hon. 
James Franklin Scally, after 
thejr’d disembarked and were get- 
ting accustomed to the pleasant- 
ly lesser gravity: “How are 

things. Your Excellency?” 

Jim Scally, Ph.D., Secretary- 
General Designate of Auxor, in- 
haled shallowly, experimentally. 
He could breathe the air, or what- 
ever it was. A little spicy, maybe, 



but he’d had to make do with a 
lot worse, such as the stuff in the 
Lincoln Tunnel in rush hour and 
a sandstorm in the Sinai Penin- 
sula. 

“How’s it smell, Jim?” Harm- 
ish asked, and his guest noticed 
the improvement in his language. 
“I think you’ll find it not too 
bad.” 

Scally saw that they were 
crossing a parklike public square, 
through which people strolled 
leisurely, enjoying the warmth of 
a sun that was bigger and duller 
than Earth’s. Like his friend 
Harmi^, they were people of 
recognizable shapes, including 
shapely female people. 

“It agrees to me so far,” Scal- 
ly found himself saying. 

“Glad to hear it.” Harmish was 
using good colloquial speech,

Soallx policed again. He was the 
one wWo was i^eaking pidgin, or 
wblatever construction Y. Haml- 
in had employed on Earth. 

Scally tried to correct this. Re- 
calling the farewell party the 
United Nations Correspondents 
Association had given for him, 
without knowing his mission, he 
said: "They hilariated when I 
hyperspaced for Auxor. Nobody 
Auxorwards, they snickerly ad- 
vised." 

"More fools they," Harmish 
said. "We get debriefed in the 
Headquarters building across the 
park. A formality only.” 

Scally nodded in confident 
tranquility. One of the female 
Auxoreans had caught his eye 
and was smiling at him. He 
stopped and grabbed Harmish’s 
arm. She was smiling and com- 
municating! 

The SPICE effect! Intergal! 
She was the slim, lovely, comfort- 
giving girl whose mind had flown 
to his out of the sea of women. 
Was she wordlessly telling him 
her name was Aura? Now he 
knew the hope her wordless mes- 
sage had expressed. She was des- 
tined to be his partner in the 
mission to unsterilize Auxor. 

He saw Harmish nodding cor- 
roboration and he knew she’d be 
there when he returned to the 
square from Headquarters. And 
be knew that she knew.

THE TROJAN 
BOMBARDMENT 

by CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 



It was America's most guarded 
Secret Weapon. Unfortunately 
its backfire threatened us fool 



G eneral Pier S. Hardesty 
placed his finger on the map. 
“Here, at Karnak City. A 
twenty-hour bombardment, and 
bombing round the clock until I 
say ‘Stop.’ Also at the road junc- 
tion north of Hellcat Pass. I want 
the defenses there plastered.” 
Bums, the artillery officer, 
shook his head. “We can do any- 
thing you want to Karnak City. 
But we can’t hit that road junc- 
tion till we either capture both 
ends of the i>ass or get some 
kind of position on the south 
slope of the Hellcat Mountains. 
There’s a little matter of lofting 
those shells over that mountain 
range.” 



“What’s tiie matter?” Hardesty 
demanded. “You’ve got 915 mm. 
howitzers running out your ears.” 

“Yes, sir. But the shells have 
a somewhat different trajectory 
from what you might expect I’d 
like to take the lot of these 915’s 
and — ” Burns told in short lan- 
guage what he would like to do 
with them. Hardesty listened 
critically, then shook his head. 

“You couldn’t do it,” he said. 
“They wouldn’t fit. Personally, 
I’d like to — ” 

The air officer put in, in a 
purring voice, “If Colonel Bums 
feels that his artillery can’t make 
it over the foothills, I’m sure we 
can plaster this road junction, 




General. With anj kind pf implo- 
sive, incendiary oi* distnaciwt 
you care to use.” 

“What we’re up against is a 
collection of ihialf-staryed, com- 
munized fanatics here, and semi- 
lunatic do-gooders at home,” 
said the general. “Personally, I’d 
like to take these Kazang rebels 
and slau^ter the lot of them. 
But they pop down holes like 
rats, bob up somewhere dse, to 
put a bullet through the back of 
your head, and if we give them 
what they deserve, everybody’s 
afraid their coreligionists will rise 
up and the thing will spread in- 
stead of ending.” He shook his 
head. “So — we’re using distrac- 
tants only.” 

*Yes, sir,” said the air officer. 
“Well, we can reach that road 
junction, sir.” 

Burns, the artillery officer, said, 
“Live distractants. They have to 
hit the junction with a reasonable 
facsimile of pinpoint accuracy.” 
“We can — ” 

^Without jarring^ 

“Ah.” 

“Parachutes won’t work. Vaned 
containers induce nausea and 
make a bad psychological effect. 
Our 915’s have a rotating base 
and tip, stabilized canister and 
proximity-controlled shortlife su- 
perrotating pop-out blades. They 
land the load genf/y.” 

The air officer snorted. “But 
at the beginning, this same load 

110 



starts off how? It’s shot out oi a 
gunJ^ 

Burns nodded. “Using micro- 
timed charges and safety vents to 
insure smooth acceleration, with 
internal cushioning in the canis- 
ter, rocket-assist units, and a bar- 
rel proportioned to fit a coast-de- 
fense gun instead of an honest 
howitzer. These 915’s may burn 
the ears off an artilleryman now 
and then, but they don’t hurt the 
charge.” 

The air officer shodk his head 
in disgust. “What a war.” 

G eneral Hardesty eyed him 
speculatively. “Can you air- 
drop these distractants on that 
road junction?” 

“Well, sir — ” 

“Our canisters,” said Burns 
helpfully, “are armored, to pre- 
vent unfortunate incidents.” 

The air officer said in disgust, 
“No, sir. I’m afraid we can’t com- 
pete under those conditions. Not 
yet, at least.” . 

“All right,” said Hardesty. 
“Let’s get this mess straightened 
out and get squared away. First 
we hit Karnak City. Twenty- 
hour bombardment and bombing 
around the clock, until I’m satis- 
fied they’ve had it. There’s, three 
battalions of the Kazang Death’s 
Head Elite Guard holed up in 
there, and they aim to make a 
house-to-house defense and then 
afterward claim we desecrated the 

GALAXY 




temple when thex left. We want 
to be sure thexVe well softened 
up before we move 

“Yes, sir. As — the charges?” 

“A, B and C, but no D. I have 
to reserve D for that road junc- 
tion.” He eyed Bums coldly. 

“Sir,” said Burns, “the 915’s 
just won’t reach that junction. 
That’s all there is to it. But if 
you decide to soften it up with A 
and B distractants, out of 155-S 
howitzers, we can do that for 
you.” 

Hardesty nodded. “All right. 
Hit the pass with A and B for a 
couple of hours, then walk on 
back and plaster the junction.” 

“When we move up later,” said 
Burns, “we can hit the junction 
with all the D you want. Ah, that 

is, with as many D canisters as 
you can load.” 

“All right. That will have to do 

it. ” 

Bums saluted and left at a 
trot. The air officer saluted and 
ran off in a different direction. 

A perspiring individual in 
fatigues, with “Correspondent” 
sewed at his shoulder, scribbled 
frantically in a notebook and 
eased closer to the scowling gener- 
al. 

“Ah — General Hardesty. May 
I ask, sir, how do you feel about 
the effectiveness of this new and 
advanced means of — er — 
settling international conflicts?” 

“IVe been directed to use it,” 

THE TROJAN BOMBARDMENT 



said the general, “and I’m using 
it.” 

“Yes, sir, but how do you feel? 
What is your assessment of the 
effectiveness of this method?” 

Hardesty squinted at the cor- 
respondent like a large dog eyeing 
a small porcupine. The fellow 
was a nuisance, all ri^t. And 
there was no question but that 
Hardesty could obliterate him. 
But in the process, he might col- 
lect some painful mementos that 
would fester for a long time after- 
ward. 

“It works,” said Hardesty ab- 
ruptly, “in the short run. In the 
long run, I foresee some difficul- 
ties.” 

“H’m. Might I ask, sir — ” 

“I can’t tell you what’s going 
to go wrong without tending to 
precipitate the very thing I want 
to avoid. Just stick around. You’ll 
see.” 

“M’m.” the correspondent was 
scribbling fast in his notebook. 
The general suddenly wondered 
how much of that was going 
to be legible later and how 
many illegible sections would be 
bridged over by the corresi>on- 
dent’s imagination. He glanced 
at his watch and saw that there 
were still a few moments till the 
105’s opened up and the air arm 
went into action. He frowned 
back at the notebook. “What sys- 
tem of shorthand is that you’re 
using?” 




‘^Shortland? Oh, my own, gen- 
eral. I leave out all the vowels; 
and capitals, and don’t bother 
with the punctuation.” 

The general nodded. ‘^Just as 
I thought.” 

Underfoot, the ground jumped. 

A few moments later someone 
shouted, ‘‘Drones out, sir!” 
The general nodded. 

A thunderous concussion rolled 
out across the flat green land 
and echoed back from the hills 
ahead. There was a continuous 
trembling underfoot. Dark forms 
blurred into the sky, to vanish 
in the direction of Kamak City, 
the Kazangs’ ancient capital and 
religious center. With a roar, the 
aircraft began to take off. 

Someone shouted, “Drones 
transmitting, sir!” 

The general nodded and walk- 
ed fast for the TV shack. The 
correspondent stayed close at his 
heels. 

“Sir!” shouted the correspon- 
dent. “Would you say this new 
and more sophisticated means of 
— ah — settling disputes is an 
outgrowth of the spectacular in- 
crease in our productive capacity, 
consequent upon progressive sci- 
entific and , technological ad- 
vances, and the rationalization of 
productive methods?” 

“I suppose so.” 

“Would you say that it repre- 
sents a hopefxil development in 

112 



relations between states and dif- 
fering ideological systems and 
viewpoints?” 

“That I don’t know.” The gen- 
eral ducked past a guard and 
through a doorway. Behind him, 
there was an angry outburst as 
the guard stopped the correspon- 
dent. The general ran down a 
flight of steps, turned a comer, 
went by another guard, and 
through another doorway. Before 
him were about a dozen big TV 
screens, arranged in a semicircle, 
with operators adjusting the 
screens for clarity and speaking 
through headphones to the drone- 
controllers overhead. Roughly 
half of the screens were already 
lit. 

The nearest lighted screen 
showed a street of small shops, 
with a trench across the street, 
the heaped-up dirt forming a 
parapet, and the crowded figures 
of Kazang rebels armed with tom- 
my-guns and bazookas peering 
out over the dirt. Down the street, 
others looked out from barricad- 
ed shops. One of the men pointed 
up and shouted, as a small para- 
chute drifted down, supporting 
some kind of dangling burden. 

Instantly a fanatical-looking 
soldier raised his gun and shot 
at it, creating a dazzle of flying 
fragments and a splash of some- 
thing dark on the front of the 
parapet. A second soldier bent 
over the parapet, straightened, 

GALAXY 




and shouted something. The first 
soldier took aim toward another 
parachute drifting down. A third 
soldier changed grips on his gim, 
and smashed the first soldier over 
the head. 

^^he small parachute drifted 
^ closer, and was immediately 
snatched from the air. For an in- 
stant, its burden was clear on the 
screen — a bottle suspended on 
a cord and labeled: 

Govt. Issue 
WHISKEY 
For offensive 
use only. 

More and more parachutes 
were drifting down, and more and 
more enemy troops were rising 
from holes to snatch them out of 
the air. 

Officers appeared, shouting 
furiously, to be hit on the head 
by drifting bottles labeled, *‘Govt. 
Issue — RUM — For offensive 
use only.’’ 

The populace was now reap- 
pearing in the streets, to snatch 
at drifting bottles. 

Discipline and order were clear- 
ly giving way, save where one 
grim and burly officer dealt out 
a savage harangue and then cau- 
tiously tried a sip from a bottle, 
and spat it on the ground. Ob- 
viously he was warning that it 
must be poison. Now, however, a 

THE TROJAN BOMBARDMENT 



surprised look crossed his face, 
and he tried again. He raised his 
eyebrows, took off his hdmet, 
eyed the bottle with a frown, 
and tried a third sip. 

More small parachutes were 
now drifting down, marked with 
concentric stripes, where the first 
had been in solid colors. These 
latter bore small cartons lettered: 

Govt. Issue 
CIGARETS* 

For offensive 
use only. 

^Caution: May be harmful 
to your health. 

The general watched alertly. 
Surely in his religious capital 
something would happen to pre- 
vent the distractants from work- 
ing unhindered. But if it was go- 
ing to happen, it would have to 
happen fast. The troops had not 
left their posts as yet, but they 
were making good use of every 
drifting opportunity as it wafted 
by. 

Now came a third set of par- 
chutes, marked with varicolored 
rays and bearing boxes of assort- 
ed sizes, that troops and populace 
alike tore open, at first warily, 
and then with wild abandon. 

Inside was a variety of differ- 
ent things, some boxes holding big 
flashlights that lit up brightly, 
others containing box cameras, 

M3 




and others clocks, already show- 
ing the correct time. All of these 
things were somewhat large and 
breakable, but useful, and good 
by local standards. 

The general glanced from 
screen to screen. To his experi- 
enced eye, it now seemed clear 
that resistance in Karnak City 
would fold up without any serious 
struggle. So much for that. But 
there was still the pass on his 
left front. Once he had that, and 
the road junction beyond, any 
counterattack would have to pro- 
ceed by awkward detours. But 
the road junction was held by 
an enemy general who knew ex- 
actly what the situation was, and 
he was there in person. 

F rom behind General Hardisty 
came the sound of loud argu- 
ing, and then the correspondent, 
shoving passes and authorizations 
back into his pocket, thrust into 
the room and stopped to stare 
at the screens. From his face, 
it was evident that he had heard 
the theory of this procedure but 
had never seen it in action before. 

*‘Ah — ah — General,” said 
the correspondent. ‘‘Ah — this 
is a bombardment with A, B, 
and C charges?” 

“Correct.” 

“But no D charges?” 

“That’s right. No D.” 

“A is — ah — ” 

“Liquor.” 

114 



“And B?” 

“Cigarets. C is bulky break- 
able objects of local value.” 
“Why bulky and breakable?” 
“When the enemy soldier has 
something bulky and breakable 
that he values and wants to hang 
onto, it cramps his style con- 
siderably. Picture yourself trying 
to fight a war with a portable TV 
in one hand.” 

“I see. What is a D charge?” 
“Stick around. You’ll see.” ’ 
“And the object of this ‘dis- 
traction attack’ is — ?” 

“According to the book: ‘Vast 
quantities of wealth and produc- 
tive effort are expended in the 
production of munitions, only a 
tiny fraction of which ever strike 
a living target. Much is wasted, 
even in attacks upon inanimate 
objects. Where these objects are 
hit, valuable structures are des- 
troyed and must be replaced at 
considerable expense by the vic- 
tors, when they occpy the con- 
quered territory. A railroad, for 
instance, destroyed in the attack, 
must be replaced in the occupa- 
tion. This all creates much waste 
and duplication of effort. Desir- 
able objects, however, like the 
Trojan horse, will be actively 
sought by the populace, and each 
one will, in effect, strike its target. 
A more desirable way to block 
a road or railroad is to place 
thereon an object of great value 
to the defender, who will feel im- 

GALAXY 




pelled to remove it carefully. 
Much can be accomplished by us- 
ing objects of local value to block 
facilities of rtational value. In this 
way, one interest in the country 
can be led to oppose another. By 
judicious use of this method, a 
chaotic situation may be created 
wherein the united enemy frag- 
ments into local groups. Since 
comparatively little killing of the 
enemy is involved, the actual ag- 
gressor using this method incurs 
comparatively little ill-feeling. It 
is a method which, of course, can 
by effectively use only by a high- 
ly productive and well organized 
power, with highly developed 
technology and reliable and flex- 
ible transportation system.’ ” 

The correspondent wrote ur- 
gently in his notebook, then look- 
ed up. ‘‘Arid this method is what 
we’re using?” 

“Exactly.” 

“What if someone shoots at our 
men?” 

“If it’s serious, shoot back.” 

“Doesn’t that create ill will?” 

^T^e general shrugged. “Con- 
* sider this present setup. An 
inefficient but at least anti-com- 
munist government is overthrown 
by fanatical communist rebels, 
who seize the capital and drive 
the legitimate but inefficient 
government to the coastal city 
from which they now rule what’s 
left of the country. The efficient 

THE TROJAN BOMBARDMENT 



but communist rebels take over, 
have a blood purge, exterminate 
anyone unfortunate enough to 
have possessions and make so 
much bad feeling that they’re 
afraid of being overthrown them- 
selves, so they efficiently create 
a murderous dictatorship. Mean- 
while, the legitimate government 
invokes our mutual- defense trea- 
ty and urges us to come in and 
slaughter every rebel Kazang 
with a head on his shoulders. 
Are you under the impression 
that anybody can do anything in 
such a setup without creating bad 
feeling of some kind?” 

The correspondent blinked. 
“Yes, I see.” 

He scribbled desperately in his 
notebook, and the general said, 
“Why not a tape recorder?” 

“I had one, but I got too close 
to one of those 915 mm. howit- 
zers. Now, general, when you ex- 
plained the theory of distraction 
warfare, you said ‘according to 
the book.’ Is there another ex- 
planation?” 

“Sure. Have you ever heard of 
Sheridan’s ride?” ■ 

“I’ve heard of it, but I don’t' 
know what it was.” 

. “Sheridan’s troops were de- 
feated by a Confederate force un- 
der the command of Early. Sheri- 
dan was away at the time, but 
rode to the battlefield, turning his 
retreating troops back as he went. 
When he reached the battlefidd, 




he found Early’s troops, who 
were suffering from want and 
hunger, plundering his camp. 
While they were still iu a state of 
disorder, Sheridan attacked and 
routed them. Throughout history, 
armies capable of standing great 
deprivation have been torn apart 
by sudden plenty and then qxiick- 
ly defeated. This has almost al- 
ways happened by accident. The 
present idea is to use it on pur- 
pose, So far, it seems to be work- 
ing. But believe me, it goes 
against the grain.” 

“But, doesn’t this method 
strengthen the enemy?” 

“What — liquor, cigarets and 
cameras, delivered to him when 
he needs maximum alertness? 
Strengthen him? How?” 

“Don’t you ever use food?” 
“Certainly, after we’ve got con- 
trol of the place, or for some 
definite purpose. The idea is to 
cause the maximum distraction 
at just the time he can least af- 
ford it, if you follow me.” 

The correspondent frowned, 
and nodded. The general glanced 
briefly at the screens, then look- 
ed back at the correspondent. 
Somewhere, the general had heard 
the saying, “He is a fool who 
cannot hide his wisdom.” Now, 
was this correspondent really 
such a dolt as he seemed to be, 
or was he merely seeming to be a 
dolt in order to get his victim to 
lower his guard. And then what 

116 



would happen? Would he send 
back such a report that the do- 
gooderg would all complain be- 
cause the poor Kazang rebels 
were being fed liquor instead of 
a balanced diet? 

“Ah — ” said the correspon- 
dent — ” these reports of 
immoral practices — ” 

“What reports of immoral prac- 
tices?” 

“There have been rumors.” 
“Get to the point.” 

“Well, it’s said that on some 
battlefields, beautiful women 
have been driven along ahead of 
the troops.” 

“That was the Kazang’s stunt, 
not ours.” 

“H’m. Well — ” 

''T^he general glanced at his 
’ watch. A few moments be- 
fore, he’d noticed another screen 
flicker on. That view was of the 
pass. Out of the comer of his eye, 
he took occasional glances at the 
screen as the correspondent asked 
more and yet more questions : 
Was this method moral? Was it 
humane? Wasn’t it really, in a 
way, more cruel than to shoot a 
man? Was it iair? Meanwhile, 
disorganization at the pass pro- 
gressed rapidly. Now the attack- 
ing troops approached, ignoring 
the liquor with a disinterest that 
spoke volumes for the regulation 
chemical in their bloodstreams 
that would make them sick if 

GALAXY 




they drank that particular brand. 
And then the troops were in the 
pass. 

Somewhere the TV observers 
watched the effect of the bom- 
bardment further ahead, taking 
pains to see that the bombard- 
ment was accurate, as usual, and 
that it was having a real and not 
only an imagined effect. But that 
collection of staggering dnmks, 
guns lost or slung at their shoul- 
ders, packs bulging and bottles 
in both hands gave testimony 
that Intelligence had correctly es- 
timated the tastes and psycholo- 
gy of the Kazang ordinary sol- 
dier. The best general officer of 
the Kazang, back at that cross- 
road, was another matter. Again 
General Hardisty glanced at his 
watch. 

. so don’t you feel,” the 
correspondent was saying, “that 
really this is a heartless and cal- 
lous exploitation of human weak- 
ness, human frailty, to subvert 
the mind and morals of your op- 
ponent from his true loyalty, to 
degrade . .” 

“Phew,” said the general. “Not 
enemy, but opponent. How did 
you degrade an opponent who 
delights in torture, who in peace- 
time considers himself clever if 
he strains ditch-water for a par- 
ticular type of intestinal parasite, 
then bribes a servant to put it 
in his competitor’s food? We are 
supposed to use only the most

knightly of methods, while our 
own men are carried off by the 
thousands, bloated from barbed 
darts, smeared with the dung of 
specially infected monkeys? Is 
that your argument?” 

“Well, of course, they are pri- 
mitive. It’s up to us — ” 

The conviction was gaining 
ground with the general that this 
particular correspondent actual- 
ly was a real, genuine, Grade-A 
boob. In that case, the fellow’s 
boobishness could be put to use. 

“. if not more honorable,” 
he was saying now, “to first send 
them a note stating clearly your 
own intentions and frankly ask- 
ing them for theirs. Then you 
could offer them, freely and open- 
ly, an equivalent amount of goods 
to what you are using now. That 
is, if they would agree to step 
back a distance, as it were. Then, 
they would get something, and 
we would get something, and it 
would be honest and aboveboard, 
and both would profit.” 

“How?” 

“Why, in that they would give 
a little, and we would give a 
little, and — ” 

“And when they wanted more, 
they’d grab territory, and we’d 
bribe them to give part of it back 
again?” 

“Well, what’s the difference be- 
tween that and this present 
method?” 

“This present method does not 

117 




give them what they need to 
make trouble. It gives them what 
the individual soldier momentar- 
ily wants. What they need and 
what they, want can be two en- 
tirely different things. We use 
that fact to split them wide open. 
While they’re split wide open, we 
move in.. Before they know what 
hit them, we do our best to set 
up an honest government, which 
is something this country hasn’t 
seen for the last one thousand 
years.” 

The correspondent appeared 
momentarily dazed. 

The general glanced at his 
watch, and frowned. ‘‘Outside, the 
artillery should be getting set 
pretty soon to let fly with those 
D-charges. Better stay down here 
when they load them.” 

The correspondent looked craf- 
ty and shot out the door and up 
the stairs. 

'"T^he general shook his head. A 

’ genuine boob. Already, on 

one of the screens, the first of 

the gigantic howitzers was roll- 
* 

ing toward the pass. By the time 
the fellow got to the spot where 
the big howitzers had been, 
they’d be set up elsewhere, and 
the view would then be coming 
in on the screen. 

The general watched the screen 
with interest. Aleardy the road 
junction was coming into view as 
the drones moved forward. For 

118 



such a valuable piece of real es- 
tate, it didn’t look like much. To 
left and right, the north-south 
road, a long strip of dust, stretch- 
ed out over the moimtain slopes, 
high above the low, wet ground. 
Straight ahead, the east-west' 
road gradually descended from 
the pass onto the one reasonably 
solid causeway through swamp 
and jungle to the neighboring 
state of Cuchang. The Cuchang 
and Kazang mutually despised 
each other, and if one threatened 
to make progress, the other kick- 
ed his feet out from under him 
out of sheer jealousy. But, having 
the same religion, they obviously 
might unite to flatten any out- 
sider with the gall to bring a new 
idea into the region. It followed, 
the general concluded, that he 
had better get a firm grip on that 
nearby narrow gateway from 
Cuchang into Kazang. Unfortun- 
ately, the Kazang had a general 
of their own who had already 
got a grip on this road center and 
intended to keep it himself. How 
to pry him loose? 

Already, the screens showed 
that the pass, from end to end, 
and the nearby slopes dominat- 
ing it were in friendly hands. Al- 
ready, the bombardment of the 
road center — using these shells 
originally intended to shoot sup- 
plies into besieged outposts — 
was producing a -whirl of gaily 
colored parachutes. 



GALAXY 




But not a single individual 
reached out to sample the temp- 
tations offered him. 

Obviously the enemy general 
had his troops well under control. 

There was a faint distinct jolt 
underfoot. 

Someone murmured, ‘‘There go 
the nine-fifteens.” 

On the screen, a new type of 
shell spun down, the sunlight 
flashing on its whirling ro- 
tors. Then another and another 
dropped down, till they seemed 
to be landing everywhere. 

General Hardisty watched 
closely. This was the acid test. 

From behind him, a familiar 
voice said, ^‘Those are the D 
charges?” 

“Yes.” 

The correspondent said, 
“What’s going on?” He sounded 
intent and serious. 

The general said, “Whoever 
has that crossroad controls 
whether troops move north and 
south on that road and whether 
they go east and west on the 
Cuchang road.” 

“Can’t they go. cross-country?” 

of course, but the 
^ country is bad. The Ka- 
zang general who had that road 
junction wants to hold it till help 
can come across from Cuchang. 
We want to take it away' from 
him. But he’s dug in. If he can 
hold it till the Cuchang get their 

THE TROJAN BOMBARDMENT 



armor across, he can make trou^ 
ble for us. We have to split hia( 
position wide open now. Once 
we break up his position, we can 
get through to blow up the cause- 
way. This will present the 
Cuchang with something of a 
problem.” 

“But how are you going to cap- 
ture that position, if their general 
can keep his troops in order? But, 
then, how can he control — ” 
General Hardisty watched the 
screens. “Either he’s convinced 
them that anything we send is 
poisoned, or he’s got some spe- 
cial troops who’ll shoot anyone 
they see so much as reach for the 
stuff.” 

“So these D charges are to 
crack their resistance?” 

“That’s the idea.” 

“What are they? Explosives?” 
“No.” 

“Gas shells? Tear gas?” 

“No.” 

“You say they’re live, right?” 
“That’s right.” 

“Hordes of plague rats?” 
Hardesty snorted. “That would 
be bright, wouldn’t it? We’re here, 
too. Wouldn’t it be shrewd of us 
to start a thing like that with 
us in the middle of it?” 

“Then what is inside?” 

“Bear in mind, we supply what 
they want. Not necessarily what 
they need, but what they want. 
What does any soldier of any 
nationality, with weeks of hard 

119 




labor and deprivation behind him, 
and stuck in some desolate hole 
— what does he want?” 

‘‘I don’t — ” 

On a nearby screen, a tall 
figure appeared out of the ground, 
walked slowly out toward one of 
the brightly-colored “^ells,” and 
turned to shake his fist. He ap- 
peared to be looking out of the 
screen almost straight at Hardis- 
ty. Silver insignia glinted at his 
collar as he glared angrily back 
toward the pass. Then he bent at 
one of the shells, worked a re- 
lease of some kind, and the top 
swung up. 

A slender woman in a long 
black dress slit up both sides 
rose up out of the shell and 
threw her arms around him. 

G eneral Hardisty glanced at 
the correspKDndent. ‘‘That’s 
his wife. We captured her two 
weeks ago.” He studied the cor- 
respondent’s face. “We only get 
the best value out of these D 
shells toward the end of a cam- 
paign, and a lot depends on Intel- 
ligence.” 

The correspondent stared at 
the screen. Men were appearing 
from the earth like ants and 
snapping open the big shells. Out 
of each climbed someone the men 
seemed very glad to see. 

“How do they know — ” 
“Each of those shells has a 
loudspeaker; each one is labeled, 

120 

l! 



and this bombardment was pre- 
ceded by dropping leaflets and an 
armored broadcast speaker.” 
The general smiled. “So now 
you see, we reunite families, and 
promote romance, at considerable 
expense to ourselves. Isn’t that 
considerate of us?” 

The screen had taken on the 
look of a huge picnic. Into the 
midst of this reunion dropped a 
barrage of freshly heated food, 
swinging on parachutes. 

And in the midst of the confu- 
sion, there raced down the road 
in a cloud of dust half-a-dozen 
loaded jeeps with no drivers visi- 
ble. The first four blew up. The 
last two bounced, crashed, 
swerved, made it to the cross- 
road and started back. 

“Remote-control,” said the gen- 
eral. “To check for mines.” 

The two remaining jeeps again 
roared up the road, and this time 
successive little groups of jeeps 
boiled up the road after them, 
bristling with guns. Behind the 
jeeps came a gigantic howitzer. 

From the direction of the jun- 
gle swamp and Cuchang, a big 
tank crawled up the road. Then, 
as the driver got a look at the 
howitzer, the tank turned aroimd 
and headed back to Cuchang 
again. 

“Just barely in time,” said the 
general. 

The correspondent was still 
staring at the reunited families, 

OAI^ 

: '■ t. ' 




feasting on the specially pro- 
vided meal fired at them in place 
of bullets. 

“Phew,” he said. “Now I see 
it. It’s all calculated. They al- 
ways get what they want when 
it so happens that what they want 
will wreck their position. Holy 

ff 

Then his eyes widened even 
further. 

The general nodded. Not a 
boob after all, he thought. Now, 
had he earlier just made believe 
he was a boob? 

Or had he actually been one, 
and now the shock had jolted 
him out of it? 

“And,” said the correspondent, 
“f/iaf’s the flaw!” 

“The what?” 

“What’s wrong with this. The 
lang-range drawback of the 
short-range advantages you 
spoke of.” 

The general nodded slowly. 
“And what is that?” 

“What happens,” said the cor- 
respondent slowly, “is we make 
this too satisfactory, too painless. 
Just suppose — ” 

The general listened critically. 
Here it came. The very thing that 
he had to throw out of his mind 
every night in order to get a little 
sleep. 



4 4 T Tere we are,” said the cor- 
respondent, “trying not to 
be brutal. We’ve hit on a system 
that actually makes it pleasant 
for the opposition to get beat. 
It’s an expensive method, but 
wars are always expensive. The 
difference with our method is it’s 
comparatively bloodless and 
even pleasant. It’s designed to 
make no unnecessary enemies. 
Half the trouble in the world 
comes from the enemies you 
made in the last fight.” 

“Yes,” said the general. 
“That’s it. And — ” 

“And,” said the correspondent, 
“now that we’ve got this compara- 
tively bloodless, pleasant way of 
waging war, this is still ruinous- 
ly expensive, however, what do 
we do if — ” 

The general nodded. “Go on.” 

“What do we do,” the corres- 
pondent concluded, “if we make 
it so pleasant that everyone wants 
to fight us.^” 

On the screen, the liquor bottles 
whirled past like snowflakes in a 
blizzard. The correspondent list- 
ened alertly, and the general list- 
ened with him. 

But no one stepped forward to 
provide an answer to that ques- 
tion.

THE DISCOVERY OF 
THE NULUTRON 



Results of an Experiment Conducted by 
Thomas M. Disch & John T. Sladek 



XTTliilst attempting a verifica- 
^ ^ tion of Drake’s classical 
''Massless Muon” experiment 
(the experiment in which a mass- 
less muon was annihilated, pro- 
ducing, as Hawakaja had earlier 
observed, Ihe supposed “iso- 
tron”), a new particle was ob- 
served, having a mass of 0, a 
charge of 0 and a spin of 0. This 
particle has been termed the 
"nullitron.” 

An Important Breakthrough 

At first the nullitron was 
thought to be a neutrino — or 
massless, uncharged particle with 
a spin of + Vl — but when the ex- 
periment was repeated using a 
gyroscopically balanced nubium 
target in place of the old, fixed 
frimium one, the spin was calcu- 
lated to be zero. 



Though having no mass, the 
particle cannot be truly termed 
subatomic, for it appears to bd 
about one meter in diameter, per- 
fectly roxmd and rather shiny^ 
Its red color can be explained 
by the well known ‘'red-shift” or. 
"Doppler” effect, caused by the 
fact that no matter from what 
vantage the particle is viewed, 
it seems to be retreating from( 
the observer uniformly at the 
speed of light. 

Whence the Nullitron? 

Whither Bound? 

The nullitron call be produced 
experimentally only under the 
most favoring circumstances. A1 
cyclotron one mile in circumfer- 
ence filled with alternate solid 
blocks of lead and quicksilver is 
useful but 'not essential. Of ut- 



122 




most importance is a willingness 
on the part of the investigator to 
discover them.* 

With the discovery of the anti- 
nullitron a great leap forward has 
been made in the general area of 
investigation concerning the nuUi- 
tron. 

A Great Leap Forward 

Like the nullitron itself, the 
anti-nullitron has a mass of 0, 
a charge of 0 and a spin of 0, 
but, unlike the nullitron, it is 
green and cubical. The most care- 
ful measurements (obtained by 
passing the nullitrons and anli- 
nullitrons through a dense field 
of spinning neutrinos, upon which 
they have curiously little effect, 
or none) show that the cubical 
anti-nullitrons are of exactly 
equal volume to the spherical nul- 
litrons. No satisfactory explana- 
tion has yet been offered for this 
phenomenon. 

Theoretical considerations lead 
to the inexorable if highly un- 
likely conclusion that nullitrons 
and anti-nullitrons exist every- 
where in nature. Indeed, the uni- 
verse can be said to be drenched 



♦The first nullitron was observed, In 
point of fact, on the isle of Ibiza, where 
the Investigators had repaired for a 
brief holiday. For three successive after- 
noons, while sleeping on the beach, Mr. 
Sladek had vivid dreams of swarms of 
nullitrons that formed Into rings, biting 
each other's tails and eventually melt- 
ing into butter. 

DISCOVERY OF NULUTRON 



with them. Due to the laws of 
conservation, however, they are 
rarely observable in their natural 
state, since the nullitrons cancel 
out the anti-nullitrons and vice 
versa. 

Not without Significance 

This does not mean, however, 
that the nullitron is not without 
significance. On the contrary, the 
nullitron is known to be in con- 
stant interaction with all known 
subatomic particles. A nullitron 
can join with a neutrino to form 
an anti -neutrino and with an 
anti-neutrino to form a neutrino. 
These interactions (and many 
more besides) are occurring con- 
stantly in nature, but (due again 
to the laws of conservation) can 
never be observed directly, only 
inferred. 

Aside from their “color,” the 
nullitron family possesses certain 
other “secondary” characteris- 
tics: 

The sound of two nullitrons 
colliding from opposite directions 
is a whirring noise, very much 
like that of a defective electric 
fan. (Such as the fan to be found 
in Room 3B in the Las Palmas 
hotel in Ibiza.) The collision of 
two anti-nullitrons, by contrast, 
produces exactly the same sound 
with the exception that in pro- 
file upon an oscilloscope the 
trouts of one pattern corres- 

123 




pond perfectly to the crests of 
the other, and vice versa. The 
result, from an auditory j>oint of 
view, is a perfect silence, which 
may account for the fact that the 
nuUitron has waited so long to 
be discovered. 

Uses of the NuUitron 

In respect to taste, the nulli- 
tron, despite its striking red hue, 
has a distinct flavor of licorice, 
while the anti-nullitron tastes like 
nothing so much as the unripe 
berries of the juniper. Further 
investigations are being carried 
out in this fruitful field, and al- 
ready manufacturers of dietetic 
foods have expressed interest in 
the possible commercial uses. The 
chief problem confronting indus- 
try is the extraction of nullitrons 
from their ‘‘potential field” in 
sufficient quantity. 

Of the possible employment in 
warfare (and particularly wheth- 
er a “nullitron-bomb” is feasible 
at this point or in the near fu- 
ture) nothing can be said with 
any confidence. 

Space, Time, and the NuUitron 

One of the most curious aspects 
of the nuUitron is its relatively 
short life. In all cases observed 
the nuUitron was instantly and 
utterly annihilated at the mo- 
ment of its creation. This was not 



apparent during the early inves- 
tigations, because the demolish- 
ed nuUitron is instantly replaced 
by another identical nuUitron, in- 
distinguishable from its “parent” 
in all respects. 

The first task which presented 
itself to investigators after the 
discovery of the nuUitron itself 
was the splitting of the nuUitron 
into subparticles. This experiment 
consisted simply of catching nul- 
litrons and hurling them with 
considerable force against a floor. 
While too little energy in the 
“nuUitron -beam” thus formed 
can cause a troublesome wobble, 
too much force will result in ex- 
cessive bouncing — the by now 
weU known “Bounce Effect.” 
This troublesome elasticity is 
most easily overcome by first 
embedding the nuUitron in a cas- 
ing of pi-mesons and then “let- 
ting Nature take its inevitable 
course.” 

While over seventeen thousand 
separate types of subnullitronic 
particles have been discovered 
by this method as of the time of 
this report, the difficulty in dis- 
tinguishing between these differ- 
ent types was great, since all the 
different subtypes created by 
this method appeared to be iden- 
tical. 

Clearly, a more sophisticated 
approach was needed. 

The method finally arrived at 
by trial and error was as follows: 



124 



GALAXY 




While one investigator holds the 
nullitron in both his hands, tKe 
other investigator either sits upon 
it or strikes it a sharp blow with 
a molybdenum hammer. Two 
main categories of subnull par- 
ticles are produced so: the ‘‘sit- 
upons” and the “others.” 

The “sit-upons” consist of isons 
(small, blue and round); nisons 
(smaller, two dimensional par- 
ticles of a curious rice color); 
and nuU-nisons (^extremely tiny, 
orange and of fanciful shapes). 

The “others” are more varied, 
falling into two main subgroup- 
ings — the isotrons and the phlo- 
gistons. The isotrons are medi- 
um-sized, ovoid, semi-massless 
particles which upon creation 
can be observed to tend immedi- 
ately to the nearest light source 
(at Las Palmas this was a single, 
bare, 25-watt bulb) and buzz 
about it until swatted or con- 
sumed by anti-isotrons. 

Countless “other” particles 
were observed, ranging in size 
from 1/8 inch to the great phlo- 
gistons, which are fully 1,800,000 
kilometers in diameter, though in 



mass equivalent to an electron. 
Only one phlogiston has been pro- 
duced experimentally. This par- 
ticle, being photophiliac, sped 
immediately toward the sun at 
an estimated velocity .9 the speed 
of light. 

A Possible Explanation of 
Matter? 

The single phlogiston pro- 
duced in this last, and definitive, 
experiment may eventually af- 
ford us an explanation of the na- 
ture of matter. On its collision 
with the sun, the phlogiston was 
annihilated, as well as the sun, 
and a number of interesting pho- 
tographs were taken. 

While it is still too early to 
begin to speculate on this phe- 
nomenon, one may look forward 
to the day when, with a fuller un- 
derstanding of the wonderful nul- 
litron, we shall possess a new 
and more comprehensive ex- 
planation of the nature of our 
“solar system” if not of “matter” 
itself. —THOMAS M. DISCH

the face of our city will also 
change instantly as we watch it. 

“We have assembled here the 
finest minds and judgments in the 
world : eight humans and one 
Ktistec machine, myself. Remem- 
ber that there are nine of us. It 
might be important.” 

The nine finest minds were: 
Epiktistes, the transcendent ma- 
chine who put the “K” in Ktistec; 
Gregory Smirnov, the large-soul- 
ed director of the Institute; Vale- 
ry Mok, an incandescent lady sci- 
entist; her over-shadowed and 
over-intelligent husband Charles 
Cogsworth; the humorless and 
inerrant Glasser; Aloysius Ship- 
lap, the seminal genius; Willy 
McGilly, a man of unusual parts 
(the seeing third finger on his 
left hand he had picked up on 
one of the planets of Kapteyn’s 
Star) and no false modesty; Au- 
difex O’Hanlon; and Diogenes 
Pontifex. The latter two men were 
not members of the Institute (on 
account of the Minimal Decency 
Rule), but when the finest minds 
in the world are assembled, these 
two cannot very well be left out. 

“We are going to tamper with 
one small detail in past history 
and note its effect,” Gregory said. 
“This has never been done before 
openly. We go back to an era that 
has been called ‘A patch of light 
in the vast gloom,’ the time of 
Charlemagne. We consider why 
that light went out and did not 

THUS WE FRUSTRATE CHARLEAAAGNE 



kindle others. The world lost four 
hundred years by that flame ex- 
piring when the tinder was ap- 
parently ready for it. We go 
back to that false dawn of Eu- 
rope and consider where it failed. 
The year was 778, and the region 
was Spain. Charlemagne had en- 
tered alliance with Marsilies, the 
Arab king of Saragossa, against 
the Caliph Abd ar-Rahmen of 
Cordova. Charlemagne took such 
towns as Pamplona, Huesca and 
Gerona and cleared the way to 
Marsilies in Saragossa. The 
Caliph accepted the situation. 
Saragossa should be independent, 
a city open to both Moslems and 
Christians. The northern march- 
es to the border of France should 
be permitted their Christianity, 
and there would be peace for 
everybody. 

“This Marsilies had long treat- 
ed Christians as equals in Sara- 
gossa, and now there would be an 
open road from Islam into the 
Frankish Empire. Marsilies gave 
Charlemagne thirty-three scho- 
lars (Moslem, Jewish and Chris- 
tian) and some Spanish mules to 
seal the bargain. And there could 
have been a cross-fertilization of 
cultures. 

“But the road was closed at 
Roncevalles where the rear- 
guard of Charlemagne was am- 
bushed and destroyed on its way 
back to France. The ambushers 
were more Basque than Moslems, 

127 




but Charlemagne locked the door 
at the Pyrenees and swore that 
he would not let even a bird fly 
over that border thereafter. He 
kept the road closed, as did his 
son and his grandsons. But when 
he sealed off the Moslem world, 
he also sealed off his own culture. 

“In his later years he tried a 
revival of civilization with a rag- 
tag of Irish half -scholars, Greek 
vagabonds and Roman copyists 
who almost remembered an older 
Rome. These weren’t enough to 
revive civilization, aiid yet Char- 
lemagne came close with themi 
Had the Islam door remained 
open, a real revival of learning 
might have taken place then 
rather than four hundred years 
later. We are going to arrange 
that the ambush at Roncevalles 
did not happen and that the door 
between the two civilizations was 
not closed. Then we will see what 
happens to us.” 

“Instrusion like a burglar 
bent,” said Epikt. 

“Who’s a burglar?” Glasser de- 
manded. 

“I am,” Epikt said. “We all 
are. It’s from an old verse. I 
forget the author; I have it filed 
in my main mind downstairs if 
you’re interested.” 

“We set out a basic text of 
Hilarius,” Gregory continued. 
“We note it carefully, and we 
must remember it the way it is. 
Very soon, that may be the way 

128 



it was. I believe that the words; 
will change on the very page of 
this book as we watch them. Just 
as soon as we have done what we 
intend to do.” 

'T^he basic text marked in the 
open book read: 

“The traitor Gano, playing a 
multiplex game, with money from 
the Cordova Caliph hired Basque 
Christians (dressed as Saragos- 
san Mozarabs) to ambush the 
rear-guard of the Frankish force. 
To do this it was necessary that 
Gano keep in contact with the 
Basques and at the same time 
delay the rear-guard of the 
Franks. Gano, however, served 
both as guide and scout for the 
Franks. The ambush was effected. 
Charlemagne lost his rear-guard, 
his scholars and his Spanish 
mules. And he locked the door 
against the Moslem world,” 
That was the text by Hilarius. 
“When we, as it were, push the 
button (give the nod to Epiktis- 
tes), this will be changed,” 
Gregory said. “Epikt, by a com- 
plex of devices which he has as- 
sembled, will send an Avatar 
(party of mechanical and partly 
of ghostly construction) , and 
something will have happened to 
the traitor Gano along about sun- 
down one night on the road to 
Roncevalles.” 

“I hope the Avatar isn’t ex- 
pensive,” Willy McGilly said.

“The Avatar is back and re- 
ports his mission accomplished,” 
Epikt stated. “I can’t see any 
change in anything either.” 

“Let’s look at the evidence,” 
Gregory said. 

The thirteen of them, the ten 
humans and the Ktistec, Chres- 
moeidec and Proaisthematic ma- 
chines, turned to the evidence 
and with mounting disappoint- 
ment. 

“There is not one word chang- 
ed in the Hilarius text,” Gregory 
grumbled, and indeed the basic 
text still read: 

“The king Marsilies of Saragos- 
sa, playing a multiplex game, took 
money from the Caliph of Cor- 
dova for persuading Charlemagne 
to abandon the conquest of Spain 
(which Charlemagne had never 
considered and couldn’t have af- 
fected); took money from Char- 
lemagne in recompense for the 
cities of the Northern marches be- 
ing returned to Christian rule 
(though Marsilies himself had 
never ruled them) ; and took 
money from everyone as toll on 
the new trade passing through his 
city. Marsilies gave up nothing 
but thirty-three scholars, the same 
number of mules and a few 
wagonloads of book-manscripts 
from the old Hellenistic libraries. 
But a road over the mountains 
was opened between the two 
worlds; and also a sector of the 
Mediterranean coast became open 

130 



to both. A limited opening was 
made between the two worlds, 
and a limited reanimation of 
civilization was affected in each.” 
“No, there is not one word 
of the text changed,” Gregory 
grumbled. “History followed its 
same course. How did our ex- 
periment fail? We tried, by a de- 
vice that seems a little cloudy 
now, to shorten the gestation per- 
iod for the new birth. It would 
not be shortened.” 

“The town is in no way chang- 
ed,” said Aloysius Shiplap. “It is 
still a fine large town with two 
dozen imposing towers of vari- 
colored limestone and midland 
marble. It is a vital metropolis, 
and we all love it, but it is now 
as it was before.” 

“There are still two dozen 
good shows in town that I 
haven’t seen,” Valery said happily 
as she examined the billings. “I 
was afraid that something might 
have happened to them.” 

“There is no change at all in 
the Beautiful Arts as reflected in 
the reviews here that we have 
taken as basic texts,” said Audi- 
fax O’Hanlon. “You can say 
w'hat you want to, but the arts 
have never been in finer shape.” 
“It’s a link of sausage,” said 
the machine Chresmoeidy. 

“ ‘Nor know the road who 
never ran it thrice,’ ” said the ma- 
chine Proaisth. “That’s from an 
old verse; I forget the author; I 

GALAXY 




have it filed in my main mind in 
England if you’re interested.” 

‘‘Oh yes, it’s the three-cornered 
tale that ends Where it begins,” 
said the machine Epiktistes. “But 
it is good sausage, and we should 
enjoy it; many ages have not 
even this much.” 

4 4XTrhat are you fellows bab- 
^^bling about?” Audifax 
asked without really wanting to 
know. “The art of painting is still 
almost incandescent in its bloom. 
The schools are like clustered 
galaxies, and half the people are 
doing some of this work for pleas- 
ure. Scandanavian and Maori 
sculpture are hard put to main- 
tain their dominance in the field 
where almost everything is extra- 
ordinary. The impassioned -comic 
has released music from most of 
its bonds. Since speculative math- 
ematics and psychology have 
joined the popular performing 
arts, there is considerably more 
sheer fun in life. 

“There’s a piece here on Pete 
Teilhard putting him into con- 
text as a talented science-fiction 
writer with a talent for outre bur- 
lesque. The Brainworld Motif 
was overworked when he tackled 
it, but what a shaggy comic ex- 
travaganza he did make of it! And 
there’s Muldoom, Zielinski, Pop- 
per, Gander, Aichinger, White- 
crow, Hornwhanger — we owe 
so much to the juice of the cul- 

THUS WE FRUSTRATE CHARLEAAAGNE 



tists! In the main line there are 
whole congeries and continents of 
great novels and novelists. 

“An ever popular art, graffiti 
on mingitorio walls, maintains its 
excellence. Travel Unlimited of- 
fers a ninety-nine day art tour 
of the world keyed to the view- 
ing of the exquisite and hilarious 
miniatures on the walls of its own 
rest-rooms. Ah, what a copious 
world we live in!” 

“It’s more grass than we can 
graze,” said Willy McGilly. “The 
very bulk of ac^hievement is 
stupefying. Ah, I wonder if there 
is subtle revenge in my choice 
of words. The experiment, of 
course, was a failure, and I’m 
glad. I like a full world.” 

“We will not call the experi- 
ment a failure since we have 
covered only a third of it,” said 
Gregory. “Tomorrow we wiU 
make our second attempt on the 
past. And, if there is a present 
left to us after that, we will make 
a third attempt the following 
day.” 

“Shove it, good people, shove 
it,” the machine Epiktistes said. 
“We will meet here again tomor- 
row. Now you to your pleasures, 
and we to ours.” 

^’T^he people talked that evening 
' away from the machines 
where they could make foolish 
conjectures without being laugh- 
ed at. 

131 




'‘Let’s pull a random card out 
of the pack and go with it,” said 
Louis Lobachevski. “Let’s take a 
purely intellectual crux of a little 
later date and see if the changing 
of it will change the world.” 

“I suggest Ockham,” said John- 
ny Konduly. 

“Why?” Valery demanded. 
“He was the last and least of the 
medieval schoolmen. How could 
anything he did or did not do af- 
fect anything?” 

“Oh no, he held the razor to the 
jugular,” Gregory said. “He’d 
have severed the vein if the razor 
hadn’t been snatched from his 
hand. There is something amiss 
here, though. It is as though I 
remembered when things were 
not so stark with Ockam, as 
theugh, in some variant, Ock- 
ham’s Terminalism did not mean 
what we know that it did mean.” 

“Sure, let’s cut the jugular,” 
said Willy. “Let’s find out the 
logical termination of Termina- 
lism and see just how deep Ock- 
ham’s razor can cut.” 

“We’ll do it,” said Gregory. 
“Our world has become some- 
thing of a fat slob; it c 1 o 5 ts; it 
has bothered me all evening. We 
will find whether purely intel- 
lectual attitudes are of actual ef- 
fect. We’ll leave the details to 
Epikt, but I believe the turning 
point was in the year 1323 when 
John Lutterell came from Oxford 
to Avignon where the Holy See 

132 



was then situated. He brought 
with him fifty-six propositions 
taken from Ockham’s Commen- 
tary on the Sentences, and he 
proposed their condemnation. 
They were not condemned out- 
right, but Ockham was whipped 
soundly in that first assualt, and 
he never recovered. Lutterell 
proved that Ockham’s nihilism 
wals a bunch of nothing. And the 
Ockham thing did die away, 
echoing dimly through the little 
German courts where Ockham 
traveled peddling his wares, but 
he no longer peddled them in the 
main markets. Yet his view point 
could have sunk the world if, in- 
deed, intellectual attitudes are of 
actual effect.” 

“We wouldn’t have liked Lut- 
terell,” said Aloysius. “He was 
humorless and he had no fire in 
him, and he was always rig^ht. 
And we would have liked Ock- 
ham. He was charming, and he 
was wrong, and perhaps we will 
destroy the world yet. There’s a 
chance that we will get our re- 
action if we allow Ockham free 
hand. China was frozen for thou- 
sands of years by an int^lectual 
attitude, one not nearly so un- 
settling as Ockham’s. India is 
hypnotized into a queer stasis 
which calls itself revolutionary 
and which does not move — h 3 ^- 
notized by an intellectual atti- 
tude. But there was never such 
an attitude as Ockham’s.” 

GALAXY 




So they decided that the former 
chancellor of Oxford, John Lut- 
terell, who was always a sick 
man, should suffer one more sick- 
ness on the road to Avignon in 
France, and that he should not 
arrive there to lance the Ock- 
ham thing before it infected the 
world. 

4 4 T et’s get on with it, good peo- 
pie,” Epikt rumbled the 
next day. ‘‘Me, I’m to stop a 
man getting from Oxford to Avig- 
non in the year 1323. Well, come, 
come, take your places, and let’s 
get the thing started.” And 
Epiktistes’s great sea-serpent 
head glowed every color as he 
puffed on a seven-branched poo- 
ka- dooka and filled the room 
with wonderful smoke. 

“Everybody ready to have his 
throat cut?” Gregory asked cheer- 
fully. 

“Cut them,” said Diogenes 
Pontifex, “but I haven’t much 
hope for it. If our yesterday’s es- 
say had no effect, I cannot see 
how on English schoolman chas- 
ing another to challenge him in 
an Italian court in France, in bad 
Latin, nearly seven hundred 
years ago, on fifty-six points of 
unscientific abstract reasoning, 
can have effect.” 

“We have perfect test condi- 
tions here,” said the machine 
Epikt. “We set out a basic text 
from Cobblestone’s History of 

THUS WE FRUSTRATE CHARLEMAGNE 



Philosophy. If our test is effec- 
tive, then the text will change be- 
fore our eyes. So will every otheTj 
text, and the world. 

“We have assembled here the 
finest minds and judgments in 
the world,” the machine Epiktist- 
es said, “ten humans and three 
machines. Remember that there 
are thirteen of us. It might be 
important.” 

“Regard the world,” said Aloy- 
sius Shiplap. “I said that yester- 
day, but it is required that I say 
it again! We have the world in 
our eyes and in our memories. 
If it changes in any way, we will 
know it.” 

“Pusih the button, Epikt,” said 
Gregory Smirnov. 

From his depths, Epiktistes the 
Ktistec machine sent our an Ava- 
tar, partly of mechanical and 
partly of ghostly construction. 
And along about sundown on the 
road from Mende to Avignon in 
the old Languedoc district of 
France, in the year 1323, John 
Lutterell was stricken with one 
more sickness. He was taken to a 
little inn in the mountain coim- 
try, and perhaps he died there. 
He did not, at any rate, arrive 
at Avignon. 

4 4T^id it work, Epikt? Is it 

-L^done?” Aloysius asked. 

“Let’s look at the evidence,” 
said Gregory. 

The four of them, the three hu- 

133 




mans and the ghost Epikt who 
was a kachenko mask with a 
speaking tube, turned to the evi- 
dence with mounting disappoint- 
ment. 

‘^There is still the stick and the 
five notches in it,” said Gregory. 
‘'It was our test stick. Nothing 
in the world is changed.” 

“The arts remain as they were,” 
said Aloysius. “Our picture here 
on the stone on which we have 
worked for so many seasons is 
the same as it was. We have 
painted the bears black, the buf- 
falos red and the people blue. 
When we find a way to make 
another color, we can represent 
birds also. I had hoped that our 
experiment might give us that 
other color. I had even dreamed 
that birds might appear in the 
picture on the rock before our 
very eyes.” 

“There’s still rump of skunk to 
eat and nothing else,” said 
Valery. “I had hoped that our 
experiment would have changed 
it to haunch of deer.” 

“All is not lost,” said Aloysius. 
“We still have the hickory nuts. 
That was my last prayer before 
we began our experiment. ‘Don’t 
let them take the hickory nuts 
away,’ I prayed.” 

They sat around the conference 
table that was a large flat natural 
rock, and cracked 'hickory nuts 
with stone fist-hammers. They 
were nude in the crude, and the 

134 



world was as it had always been. 
They had hoped my magic to 
change it. 

“Ei>ikt has failed us,” said 
Gregory. “We made his frame 
out of the best sticks, and we 
plaited his face out of the finest 
weeds and grasses. We chanted 
him full of magic and placed 
all our special treasures in his 
cheek pouches. So, what can the 
magic mask do for us now?” 
“Ask it, ask it,” said Valery. 
They were the four finest minds 
in the world — the three humans, 
Gregory, Aloysius and Valery 
(the only humans in the world 
unless you count those in the 
other valleys), and the ghost 
Epikt, a kachenko mask with a 
speaking tube. 

“What do we do now, Epikt?” 
Gregory asked. Then he went 
around behind Epikt to the 
speaking tube. 

“I remember a woman with a 
sausage stuck to her nose,” said 
Epikt in the voice of Gregory. 
“Is that any help?” 

“It may be some help,” Gre- 
gory said after he had once more 
taken his place at the flat-rock 
conference table. “It is from an 
old (What’s old about it? I made 
it up myself this morning) folk 
tale about the three wishes.” 
“Let Epikt tell it,” said Valery. 
“He does it so much better than 
you do.” Valery went behind 
Epikt to the speakmfe tube and 

GALAXY 




blew smoke through it from the 
huge loose black-leaf uncured 
stogie that she was smoking. 

‘‘The wife wastes one wish for 
a sausage,” said Epikt in the 
voice of Valery. “A sausage is a 
piece of deer-meat tied in a piece 
of a deer's stomach. The husband 
is angry that the wife has wasted 
a wish, since she could have wish- 
ed for a whole deer and had 
many sausages. He gets so angry 
that he wishes the sausage might 
stick to her nose forever. It does, 
and the woman wails, and the 
man realized that he had used up 
the second wish. I forget the rest.” 

“You can't forget it, Epikt!” 
Aloysius cried in alarm. “The fu- 
ture of the world may depend 
on your remembering. Here, let 
me reason with that damned 
magic mask!” And Aloysius went 
behind Epikt to the speaking 
tube. 

“Oh yes, now I remember,” 
Epikt said in the voice of Aloysi- 
us. “The man used the third wish 
to get the sausage off his wife’s 
nose. So things were the way they 
had been before.” 

“But we don't want it the way 
it was before!” Valery howled. 
“That's the way it is now, rump 
of skunk to eat, and me with 
nothing to wear but my ape cape. 
We want it better. We want deer 
skins and antelope skins.” 

“Take me as a mystic or don’t 
take me at all,” Epikt signed off. 

THUS WE FRUSTRATE CHARLEMAGNE 



“Even though the world has al- 
ways been so, yet we have inti- 
mations of other things,” Gregory 
said. “What folk hero was it who 
made the dart? And of what did 
he make it?” 

“Willy McGilly was the folk 
hero,” said Epikt in the voice of 
Valery, who had barely got to 
the speaking tube in time, “and 
he made it out of slippery elm 
wood.” 

“Could we make a dart like the 
folk hero Willy made?” Aloysius 
asked. 

“We gotta,” said Epikt. 

“Could we make a slinger and 
whip it out of our own context 
and into — ” 

“We gotta,” said Epikt. 

“Could we kill an Avatar with 
it before he killed somebody 
else?” Gregory asked excitedly. 

“We sure will try,” said the 
ghost Epikt who was nothing but 
a kachenko mask with a speaking 
tube. “I never did like those Ava- 
tars.” 

You think Epikt was nothing 
but a kachenko mask with a 
speaking tube! There was a lot 
more to him than that. He had 
red garnet rocks inside him and 
real sea salt. He had powder made 
from beaver eyes. He had rat- 
tlesnake rattles and armadillo 
shields. He was the first Ktistec 
machine. 

“Give me the word, Epikt,” 
Aloysius cried a few moments 

135 




later as he fitted the dart to the 
slkiger. 

‘‘Fling it! Get that Avatar 
fink!’’ Epikt howled. 



\ long about sundown in an un- 
numbered year, on the Road 
from Nowhere to Eom, an Avatar 
fell dead with a slippery-elm dart 
in his heart. 

“Did it work, Epikt? Is it 
done?” Charles Cogsworth asked 
in excitement. “It must have. I’m 
here. I wasn’t in the last one.” 
“Let’s look at the evidence,” 



Gregory suggested calmly. 

“Damn the evidence!” Willy 
McGilly cussed. “Remember 
where you heard it first.” 

“Is it started yet?” Glasser 
asked. 

“Is it finished?” Audifax 
O’Hanlon questioned. 

“Push the button, Epikt!” Dio- 
genes barked. “I think I missed 
part of it. Let’s try it again.” 
“Oh, no, no!” Valery forbade. 
“Not again. That way is rump of 
skimk and madness.”

FORECAST 

Hayden Howard's stories of the Eskimo invasion of the world come 
to their climax in the next issue of Galaxy with a complete short novel called 
The Purpose of Life. We've been reading the mail on this unusual series with 
unusual Interest; apparently the cumulative effect of the series has been to 
arouse both curiosity and excitement. What are the Esks? How did they come 
to Earth? And, above all, why? WeVe happy to tell you that in the next 
issue of Galaxy you'll get all the answers. 

You'll also get an unusually good novelette by Keith Laumer called 
Thunderhead. Curious thing about Laumer. Best known for his mordant 
and comic J^etief series, he Isn't usually thought of as the kind of writer 
who can evoke emotions. But we have it on the testimony of some rather 
hard-bitten readers that now and then he has been able to move them 
very deeply; and we have a notion that Thunderhead is the kind of story 
that will do that again. 

We've also a specially bright and bushy-tailed bunch of short 
pieces by Kris Neville, Christopher Anvil, C. C. MacApp and others — some 
of them will likely fit in the next issue, though we don't yet know which. 
Good issue. We recommend it.

galaxy. Revenge was near — if only 
he could learn which man was his foe!

B ehind the hotel waited a long 
omnibus with six bladder 
wheels and a canopy of rosy pink 
silk. Amid banter, laughing and 
repartee, the guests — eleven 
men, ten women — climbed 



aboard and settled themselves up- 
on cushions of purple satin. The 
bus trundled across the canal and 
away to the south; Kouliha with 
its tall towers was left behind. 

For an hour the guests rode 
past carefully tended farms and 
orchards, toward a line of wood-

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



To one purpose had Keith Gersen dedicated his life: To re- 
venge himself against the Demon Princes of space who had massa- 
cred his parents when he was a child* For that he had trained him- 
self in the arts of assassination and intrigue. For that he had given 
up the comforts of home and family. 

Two of the Demon Princes he had already destroyed, but 
others remained alive, and of them all the deadliest and most hated 
was Viole Falushe. Gersen followed the trail of Falushe across the* 
galaxy • . and missed him at every turn. On ancient Earth he set 
a trap and baited it with the loveliest girl he had ever seen; Falushe 
escaped It. 

But with the aid of the half-mad, drunken poet Novarth, Gersen 
was able to penetrate the stronghold of Falushe; he obtained an 
invitation to Falushe's notorious Palace of Love. 

There was one drawback. He had secured entry to the Palace 
of Love. But he had an uneasy suspicion that Falushe knew all about 
him. Would he be able to get out again as easily? 



ed hills, and speculation was rife 
as to the exact location of the 
Palace of Lrove. Hygen Grote 
went so far as to push into the 
forward compartment and make 
inquiry of the gaunt woman in the 
brown and black uniform who 
was driving. Hygen Grote was re- 
buffed and returned to 'his seat 
grinning ruefully and shaking his 
head. Up into the hills rolled the 

138 



bus, under tall, umbrella-shaped 
trees with glossy black trunks 
and green-yellow leaf-<hsks. From 
somewhere in the distance came 
the hldodious hooting of tree- 
dweRing creatures. Enormous 
white motl^ fluttered through 
the shade, whidh became ever 
more dank, ever more pungent 
with the reek of lichens and large- 
leafed shrubs. At the ridge the 

GALAXY 





road broke out into a dramatic 
blaze of sunli^t. 

Ahead spread a vast blue ocean. 
The bus plunged down a steqp 
straight road and halted at a 
dock. Here waited a glass-hulled 
yacht with blue decks and a white 
metal superstructure. Four ste- 
wards in dark blue and white uni- 
forms assisted the guests from the 
bus, conducted them to a build- 
ing of white coral blocks. Here 
they were asked to change into 
new garments: white yachting 
costumes, with rope sandals, loose 
white linen cax>s. The Druids pro- 
tested vigorously on doctrinal 
grounds. They flatly refused to 
part with their cowls; and so 
they boarded the yacht, the men 
attired in white trousers and 
jackets, the women in white 
skirts and jackets, with heads en- 
cowled in black as before. 

^■T%e time was sxmset; the yacht 
would not get under way un- 
til the morrow. The passengers 
assembled in the saloon, where 
they were served Earth-t5rpe 
cocktails, and presently dinner. 
The two younger Druids, Hule 
and Billika, wore their cowls rath- 
er more loosely than their par- 
ents, thereby incurring repri- 
mands. 

After dinner the three yoimg 
men, Mario, Tanzel and Ethuen, 
played deck tennis with Tralla 
and Momice. Drusilla huddled 

THE PAUCE OF LOVE 



disconsolately near Nayarth, who 
conducted the strangest of con- 
veri^ttons with Druidess Laidig. 
Gersen sat to the side watching, 
propounding speculations, won- 
dering where his responsibilities 
lay and to whom. 

From time to time Drusilla 
wistfully looked across the saloon 
toward him. Clearly she dreaded 
the future — with good reason, 
thought Gersen. He could think 
of no way to reassure her. Zuly 
the dancer, supple as a white eel, 
walked around the deck with da- 
Nossa. Skebou Diffiani the Quan- 
tique stood by the rail, thinking 
the mysterious thoughts of his 
race, with an occasional contemp- 
tuous glance toward daNossa and 
Zuly. 

Billika shyly came up to talk 
to Drusilla, followed by Hule, 
who seemed to find Drusilla at- 
tractive. Billika, somewhat flush- 
ed, had been tasting wine. She 
wore her cowl artfully disarrang- 
ed to show her curly brown hair. 
The situation did not evade the 
notice of Druidess Laidig — who, 
however, was unable to detach 
herself from Navarth. 

Margary Liever chatted with 
Hygen Grote and his companion 
Doranie, tmtil Doranie became 
bored and went to saunter along 
the deck. To Hygen Grote’s an- 
noyance, she was joined there by 
Lerand Wible. 

The Druids were the first to 

139 




bed, followed by Hygen Grote 
and Doranie. 

Gersen went out on the deck 
to look up at the sky, where the 
stars of Simeste Cluster blazed. 
To the south and east heaved the 
waters of an ocean whose name 
he did not know. Not far distant 
Skebou Diffiani leaned on the 
rail, looking across the same 
ocean. 

Gersen returned within. Drusil- 
la had gone to her stateroom. On 
the sideboard the stewards had 
arranged a collation of meats, 
cheese, fowl, aspic, a selection of 
wines and liquors. 

Zuly conversed in low tones 
with daNossa. Margary Liever 
now sat alone, a vague smile on 
her face; was she not achieving 
her heart’s desire? Navarth had 
become somewhat drunk and was 
swaggering about, spoiling for an 
opportunity to produce a drama- 
tic scene. But everyone else was 
relaxed and gave him no scope. 
Navarth finally threw up his 
hands and went off to bed. Ger- 
sen, after a last look aroxmd, fol- 
lowed. 

G ersen awoke to the pitch and 
roll of the yacht. The time 
was shortly after dawn. Sunlight 
slanted into the cabin throu^ 
the section of hull above the 
waterline. Below, dark blue water 
surged past, not yet illuminated 
by the sun. 

140 



Gersen dressed and went to the 
saloon, to find himself the earliest 
riser. Land lay four or five miles 
off the starboard beam : a narrow 
beach, a wooded foreshore backed 
by low hills, with the hint of pur- 
ple mountains in the distance. 

Gersen helped himself to 
breakfast at the buffet. As he ate 
other guests appeared, and pres- 
ently the entire complement sat 
in the saloon, devouring grills and 
pastries, drinking hot beverages, 
marveling at the scenery and the 
easy motion of the yacht. 

After breakfast Gersen went 
out upon the deck, where he was 
joined by Navarth, foppish in his 
white yachting costume. The day" 
was perfect; sunlight glinted on 
the blue swells; clouds soiared 
above the horizon. Navarth spat 
over the side, contemplated the 
sun, the sky, the sea. “The jour- 
ney begins. It must start like 
this, innocent and pure.” 

Gersen understood Navarth’s 
meaning well enough. He made 
no comment. 

Navarth spoke again, in a voice 
even more gloomy. “No matter 
what else you say of Vogel, he 
knows how to do a thing well.” 
Gersen inspected the gold but- 
tons on 'his jacket. They seemed 
no more than buttons. In response 
to Navarth’s puzzled stare he 
said mildly, “Such articles 'have 
been known to conceal spy-cells.” 
Navarth laughed hoarsely. “Not 

GALAXY 




likely. Vogel may well be aboard, 
but he won’t be eavesdropping. 
He’d be afraid of hearing some- 
thing unpleasant.” 

“You think he’s aboard, then?” 
“He’s aboard, no fear. Would 
he miss an experience like this? 
Never! But whidi is he?” 

Gersen considered. “He’s not 
you nor I, nor the Druids. He’s 
not Diffiani.” 

“He would not be Wible, a 
different t 3 rpe altogether, too 
fresh and fair and round. He 
would not be daNossa, though it’s 
barely possible. Barely xK)ssible 
he’s one of the Druids. But I 
think not.” 

“That leaves only three. The 
tall dark men.” 

“Tanzel, Mario, Ethuen. He 
could be any of these.” 

They turned to consider the 
three men. Tanzel stood at the 
bow, looking ahead across the 
ocean. Ethuen sat sprawled in a 
deck chair, talking to Billika, who 
squirmed in mingled embarrass- 
ment and pleasure. Mario, the 
last to arise, had just finished 
breakfast and was stepping out 
on deck. Gersen tried to matdi 
each of them to what he knew 
of Viole Falushe. Each was tense, 
yet elegant. Each mi^t have been 
Possibility No. 2, the murderer 
in harlequinade who had fled on 
long legs from Navarth’s i>arty. 

“Any could be Viole Falushe,” 
said Navarth. 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



“And what of Zan Zu — Dru- 
silla — whatever her name?” 

“She is doomed.” Navarth 
threw his hands up in the air and 
stalked away. 

Gersen looked toward Drusilla, 
as he had decided to think of 
her. She stood talking to Hule, 
the young Druid, who in the fer- 
vor of the moment had let fall 
his cowl. A handsome lad, 
thought Gersen: earnest, with a 
look of internal tension which wo- 
men must eventually find provo- 
cative. Indeed Drusilla was ex- 
amining him with some interest. 
Druidess Wust barked a sharp 
order. Hule guiltily snapped up 
his cowl and slunk away. 

Gersen went over to Drusilla. 
She gave him a look of wary wel- 
come. 

“Were you surprised to see us 
at the hotel?” Gersen asked. 

She nodded. “I had never ex- 
pected to see you again.” After 
a moment’s hesitation she asked, 
“What’s going to happen to me? 
Why am I so important?” 

G ersen. still in doubt regarding 
spy-cells, spoke cautiously: 
“I don’t know what will happen. 
I will protect you, if I can. You’re 
important because you resemble 
a girl Viole Falushe once loved 
and who scorned him. He may 
be aboard the yadit; he may be 
one of the passengers. So you 
must be very careful.” 



141 




Drusilla turned a fearful look 
around the deck. ''Which one?” 
"You remember the man at 
Navarth’s party?” 

“Yes.” 

"He will be a man like that.” 
Drusilla winced. "I don’t know 
how to be careful. I wish I were 
someone else.” She looked over 
her shoulder. "Can’t you take me 
away?” 

"Not now.” 

^'Why did it have to be me.^” 
"I mi^t answer if I knew who 
you were to begin with. Zan Zu? 
Drusilla Wayles? Jheral Tinzy?” 
"I’m none of them,” ^e said 
in a dolorous voice. 

"Who are you?” 

"I don’t know.” 

"You don’t have a name?” 
"The man at the dock saloon 
called me Spooky. That’s not 
Smuch of a name. I’ll be Drusilla 
Wayles.” She looked at him care- 
fully. "You’re not really a journa- 
list, are you?” 

“I am Henry Lucas, a mono- 
maniac. And I mustn’t talk to 
you too much. You know why.” 
Drusilla’s face lost its momen- 
tary animation. "If you say so.” 
"Try to identify Viole Falu- 
she,” said Gersen. "He will want 
you to love him. If you don’t, 
he’ll hide 'his anger, but you may 
know by a glance, a threat, a look 
on his face. Or while he flirts 
with someone else he will watch 
to see if you notice.” 

142 



Drusilla pursed her lips doubt- 
fully. "I’m not very discerning.” 
"Do your best, but be careful. 
Don’t bring trouble on yoursdf. 
Here comes Tanzel.” 

'^ood morning, good morning,” 
said Tanzel breezily. He spoke 
to Drusilla. "You look as if you’ve 
lost your last friend. That’s not 
the case, you know, not with 
Harry Tanzel aboard! Cheer up! 
We’re off to the Palace of Love!” 
Drusilla nodded. "I know.” 
"Just the place for a pretty 
girl. I’ll personally diow you all 
the sights, if I can fight off my 
competitors.” 

Gersen laughed. "No competi- 
tion here. I can’t take time from 
my job, mudh as I’d like to.^’ 
"Job? At the Palace of Love? 
Are you an ascetic?” 

"Simply a journalist. What I 
see and hear will show up in Cos- 
mopolis** 

"Keep my name out of it!” 
warned Tanzel facetiously. 
"Someday 111 be a married man; 
I’d never live down that kind of 
fame.” 

"I’ll be discreet.” 

"Good. Come along now.” Tan- 
zel took Drusilla’s arm. "I’ll help 
you with your morning constitu- 
tionial. Fifty times around the 
deck!” 

They walked off, Drusilla with 
a last forlorn glance over her 
shoulder at Gersen. 

Navarth sidled up. "There’s 

GALAXY 




one of them. Is he the man?” 
don’t know. He’s starting 
strong.” 

XXI 

'^hree days the yacht plied the 
sunny seas. For Gersen they 
were three pleasant days, though 
the hospitality came from a man 
he intended to kill. 

There was an effortless quality 
to the hours, a dreamlike isola- 
tion. Each person’s characteristic 
style was intensified, becoming a 
thing larger than life. Attitudes 
and rigidities relaxed. Hule allow- 
ed his cowl to hang loose and fi- 
nally discarded it altogether; 
Billika, more tentatively, did the 
same, whereupon Zuly in a spirit 
of cool mischief offered to ar- 
range her hair. Billika hesitated, 
then, with a sigh of hedonistic 
abandon, assented. So Zuly shap- 
ed and clipped, to accentuate 
Billika’s pale, wide-eyed delicacy, 
to the amazement of all the men 
aboard. Druidess Laidig cried out 
in anger; Druidess Wust clicked 
her tongue; the two Druids were 
startled; but all the others begged 
them not to browbeat the girl. 
Such was the atmosphere of ease 
and gayety that Druidess Laidig 
at last fell to laughing at Navar- 
th, and Billika managed to slip 
away quietly. 

Not long after, Druidess Laidig 
allow’ed her own cowl to hang 

IHE PALACE OF LOVE 



loose, as presently did Druid 
Dakaw. Druid Pruitt and Drui- 
dess Wust held to the full rigor 
of their habit, but tolerated the 
delinquency of the others with 
no more than an occasional dis- 
paraging glance, or muttered sar- 
casm. 

Tralla, Mornice and Doranie, 
noting the attention paid to the 
younger girls, became extremely 
enthusiastic and gay. Clearly 
none planned to rebuff any at- 
tempted gallantry. 

Each afternoon the yacht halt- 
ed to drift on the ocean. All who 
chose plimged into the clear 
water, while others went below 
to watch through the glass hull. 
These latter included the older 
Druids, Diffiani (who partici- 
pated in no activity except eat- 
ing and drinking), Margray Lie- 
ver, who professed a fear of deep 
water, and Hygen Grote, who 
could not swim. The others, even 
Navarth, donned the swimsuits 
provided by the yacht and splash- 
ed in the warm ocean. 

A t dusk of the second evening, 
Gersen took Drusilla to the 
bow, refraining from any intima- 
cy or contact which might in- 
furiate Viole Falushe, should he 
be watching. Drusilla seemed to 
feel no such constraint, and Ger- 
sen became aware, with a bitter- 
sweet pang, that the girl was in 
some degree infatuated with him. 

V Jv. 




Gersen, as susceptible as anyone 
else, fought back his inclinations. 
Even if he succeeded in destroy- 
ing Viole Falushe, what then? 
There was no place for Drusilla 
in the harsh future he had laid 
out for himself. Still, the temp- 
tation remained. Drusilla, with 
her somber moods, her sudden 
flashes of joy, was fascinating. 

But circumstances were as they 
were, and Gersen kept his conver- 
sation to the business at hand. 
Drusilla had noticed nothing. 
Mario, Ethuen, Tanzel — all 
plied her with attention. As Ger- 
sen had instructed, she showed 
favoritism to none. 

Even as they stood in the bow 
watching the sunset Mario came 
to join them. After a moment or 
two Gersen excused 'himself, and 
returned to the promenade. If 
Mario were Viole Falushe, it 
would not do to antagonize him. 
If he were not, then Viole Falu- 
she, watching balefully from else- 
where, would be reassured that 
Drusilla preferred no single per- 
son. 

_ / 

The morning of the fourth day 
found the yacht cruising among 
small islands lush with vegeta- 
tion. At noon the yacht approach- 
ed the mainland and drifted up 
to a dock. The voyage was over. 
The pa^engers disembarked re- 
gretfully, with many a backward 
glance; Margray Liever frankly 
wept. 

144 



In a structure beside the dock 
the guests were issued new gar- 
ments. For the men there were 
loose velvet blouses in the soft- 
est and richest of colors: moss 
green, cobalt blue, dark maroon, 
with loose black velvet trousers 
fastened below the knees with 
scarlet ribbons. The women re- 
ceived the same style blouses in 
paler shades, with striped match- 
ing skirts. All were issued soft 
velvet berets, square, loose, with 
an intriguing tassel. 

When all had reassembled, they 
were served limch, then ushered 
to a great wooden wagon with six 
green and gold wheels, a dark 
green canopy supported by spiral 
posts of a beautiful dark wood. 

The wagon set off along a 
coastal road. Late in the afternoon 
the track veered inland, over roll- 
ing grassy hills spangled with 
flowers, and the ocean was lost 
to sight. 

Soon there were trees, tall and 
solitary, much like Earth trees, 
but conceivably indigenous; then 
clximps and groves. At dusk the 
wagon halted beside one such 
grove. The guests were conducted 
to a hostel built high in the tree- 
tops, led along swaying walkways 
to small wicker tree houses. 

S upper was served on the 
ground to the li^t of a great 
crackling fire. The wine seemed 
stronger than usual, or perhaps 

GALAXY 




all were in a mood to drink. 
Everyone seemed larger than 
life; the twenty-one were the 
only people alive in the universe. 
Toasts were drunk, including sev- 
eral to “our unseen host.” The 
name Viole Falushe was never 
mentioned. 

A troupe of musicians appear- 
ed, with fiddles, guitars, pipes. 
They played wild wailing tunes 
which set the heart pounding and 
the head swaying. Zuly leapt to 
her feet and improvised a dance 
as wild and abandoned as the 
music. 

Gersen forced himself to sobrie- 
ty. At times like this it was most 
important to watch. He saw Le- 
rand Wible whisper to Billika; 
a moment later she sidled away 
and off into the shadows, and he 
too was gone. The Druids and 
Druidesses were rapt with the 
dancing, sitting with heads back, 
eyes half- closed. Only Hule no- 
ticed. He looked thoughtfully 
after the two, then crept quietly 
up to Drusiha and whispered in 
her ear. 

Drusilla smiled. She turned a 
flicker of a glance toward Gersen 
and said something in a soft 
voice. Hule nodded without en- 
thusiasm and seated himself close 
beside her. Presently he put his 
arm around her waist. 

A half-hour passed. With only 
Gersen seeming to notice, Wible 
and Billika were once more 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



among the group, Billika with 
eyes brig^it and mouth soft. It 
seemed that only a moment later 
Druidess Laidig bethought herself 
of Billika and sought around to 
locate her. There sat Billika. 
Something was amiss, something 
was new and different; Druidess 
Laidig could sense this much, but 
there was nothing else to see. 
Her suspicious lulled, she return- 
ed to her enjoyment of the music. 

Gersen watched Mario, Ethuen, 
Tanzel. They sat with Tralla and 
Mornice, but it seemed as if their 
eyes wandered toward Drusilla. 
Gersen chewed his lip. Viole 
Falushe — if indeed he were 
among the guests — did not seem 
disposed to yield his identity. 

♦Wine, music, firelight! Gersen 
leaned back, aware of giddiness. 
Who among the group was 
watchful? Who attentive? — that 
person would be Viole Faludie! 
Gersen saw no one who seemed 
other than relaxed. Druid Dakaw 
was asleep. Druidess Laidig was 
nowhere to be seen. Skebou Dif- 
fiani also had disappeared. Ger- 
sen chuckled and leaned toward 
Navarth to share the joke, then 
thought better of it 

The fire became embers; the 
musicians wandered away like 
figures in a dream. The guests 
roused themselves and went by 
swaying walkways to their wick- 
er cabins. If other assignations 
had been made, if other trysts 

145 




were kept, Gersen had no knowl- 
edge of them. 

I n the morning the guests 
asseinbled for breakfast to find 
that the wagon was gone, and 
there was speculation as to what 
mode of transport next would be , 
offered them. After breakfast a 
steward pointed out a path. 
‘‘There we will go. I have been 
requested to guide. If all are 
ready, I suggest that we set off, 
for there is far to go before eve- 
ning.” 

Hygen Grote spoke in an as- 
tonished voice. “You mean to 
say we walk?^* 

“Exactly this, Lord Grote. 
There is no other way to our 
destination.” 

“I never expected all this back- 
ing and filling,” complained 
Grote. “I thought that when we 
were invited to the Palace of 
Love, an air- car simply took us 
there.” 

“I am only a servant. Lord 
Grote; I can offer no explana- 
tion.” 

Grote turned away, not com- 
pletely pleased. But he had no 
choice. Presently his spirits rose, 
and he was the first to start sing- 
ing an old walking song of his 
fraternity at Lublinken College. 

Over low hills, through glades 
and groves, went the path. They 
walked over a wide meadow, 
startling a number of white 

146 



birds into flight; they descended 
a valley to a lake, where lunch 
awaited them. 

The steward would not allow 
an over-long rest. “There is still 
far to go, and we cannot walk fast 
for fear of tiring the ladies.” 

“I’m already tired,” snapped 
the Druidess Wust. “I don’t in- 
tend to move another step.” 

“Anyone who wishes may re- 
turn,” said the steward. “The 
path is plain, and there is a staff 
to assist you along the way. But 
now it is time for the rest of us 
to go on. It is afternoon, and a 
wind is rising.” 

Indeed a breeze with a hint of 
coolness blew small wavelets 
across the lake, and the western 
sky was paved with herringbone 
clouds. 

Druidess Wust elected to con- 
tinue with the group, and all set 
off along the shore of the lake. 
Presently the path turned aside, 
moimted a slope and struck off 
across a parkland of tall trees and 
long grass. On and on trudged 
the party, with the wind at their 
backs. With the sun declining be- 
hind a range of mountains they 
halted for pastries and tea. Then 
off once more, with the wind 
sighing through the branches. 

As the sun sank behind the 
moimtains the party entered a 
dank, heavy woods, which seem- 
ed all the darker for the going 
of the sun. * 



GALAXY 




The pace was slow. The older 
women were tired, though only 
Druidess Wust complained. Drui- 
dess Laidig wore a grim expres- 
sion while Margray Liever stroll- 
ed along with her customary 
small smile. Hygen Grote had 
lapsed into sulky silence, except 
for an occasional terse word to 
Doranie. 

The woods seemed endless; the 
wind, now distinctly cool, roar- 
ed through the upper branches. 
Dusk fell over the mountains; at 
last the party stumbled into a 
clearing to find a rambling old 
forest lodge of timber and stone. 
The windows glowed with yellow 
lights, smoke drifted from a diim- 
ney; within must be found warm- 
th and food and good cheer. 

A nd so it was. The tired travel- 
ers, climbing stone steps to 
the porch, entered a vast, beam- 
ed parlor, with bright rugs on the 
tloor and a roaring blaze in the 
fireplace. Some of the group sank 
gratefully into deep chairs, others 
chose to go to their rooms to re- 
fresh themselves. Once again new 
clothing was issued: for the men 
black trousers and sihort jacket 
with a dark brown cummerbimd; 
for the ladies long trailing black 
gowns with white and brown 
flowers for the hair. 

Those who had bathed and 
dressed returned to the parlor, 
to the envy of those who still sat 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



tired and dirty. Presently all had 
bathed and changed into the new 
dark garments. 

Mulled wine and served, and 
presently a hearty forest dinner: 
goulash, bread and cheese, red 
wine; and all the toil of the day 
was forgotten. 

After dinner the guests gather- 
ed around the fir^lace to sip 
liquors. Now the talk was loud 
and brave, everyone speculating 
as to where lay the Palace of 
Love. Navarth struck a drama- 
tic pose in front of the fire. ‘Tt 
is plainl” he cried in a great 
brassy voice. ‘Dr is it not? Does 
not everyone imderstand, or is 
it left to old Navarth, the poet, 
to illuminate?” 

“Speak, Navarth!” called Ethu- 
en. “Reveal to all your insights; 
why cherish them for your pri- 
vate pleasure?” 

“I have never had that inten- 
tion. All will know what I know; 
all will feel what I feel. We are 
midway along the journey! Here 
is where the carelessness, the 
amplitude, the clam ease depart. 
The winds arose at our back and 
hurried us through the woods. Our 
refuge is medievalism!” 

“Come now, old man,” chaffed 
Tanzel. “Speak so we can imder- 
stand you.” 

“Those who understand me will 
do so; those who cannot will never 
do so. But all is clear. He knows, 
he knows!” 



147 




Bruidess Laidig, impatient with 
hyperbole, spoke crossly. ‘‘He 
knows what? Who knows what?” 
“What are we all but perambu- 
latory nerves? The artist knows 
the linkage of nerve with nerve!” 
“Speak for yourself,” muttered 
Diffiani. 

Navarth performed one of his 
extravagant gesticulations. “He is 
a poet like myself! Did I not 
teach him? Every pang of the 
soul, every wry ache of the mind, 
every whisper of blood — ” 

‘ ‘Navarth ! N avarth ! ’ groaned 
Wible. “Enough! Or at any rate, 
something different. Here we are 
in this strange old lodge, a per- 
fect refuge for ghosts and wip- 
warks.” 

Druid Pruitt spoke sententious- 
ly, “This is our lore; each man 
and each woman is a living seed. 
When his planting time comes, 
he is delved and covered and fi- 
nally comes forth as a tree. And 
each soul is distinct. There are 
birches and oaks and lavengars 
and black paneys — ” 

The talk proceeded. The 
younger and more energetic folk 
explored the ancient structure and 
played hide-and-seek in the long 
hall, among the billowing amber 
curtains. 

Druidess Laidig became un- 
easy and craned her neck to find 
Billika. At last ^e hoisted herself 
to her feet and went off, looking 
here and there, presently to re- 

148 



turn with a downcast Billika. 
Druidess Laidig muttered some- 
thing to the Druidess Wust, who 
jumped up and went off down the 
hall. There were loud echoing 
voices in the hall, then silence. A 
moment later Wust returned with 
Hule, Who seemed sullen. 

'T^hree minutes later Drusilla 
came back to the saloon. Her 
face was flushed, her eyes alive 
with something between mirth 
and mischief. The dark gown 
suited her beautifully; she had 
never looked more beautiful. She 
crossed the room and slipped into 
the seat beside Gersen. 

“What happened?” he asked. 

“We played a game in the hall. 
I hid with Hule and watched, as 
you told me, to see who would be 
most angered.” 

“And who was?” 

“I don^t know. Mario says he 
loves me. Tanzel was laughing, 
but he was annoyed. Ethuen said 
nothing and would not look at 
me.” 

“What were you doing, that 
they should be angry? Don’t for- 
get it’s dangerous to thwart peo- 
ple.” 

Drusilla’s mouth drooped. 
“Yes. I forgot. I should feel 
fri^tened. ... I do feel frighten- 
ed, when I think about it. But 
you will take care of me, won’t 
you?” 

“I will if I can.” 



GALAXY 




‘‘You can. I know you can.” 
“I hope I can. Well, what was 
going on to annoy Mario, Tanzel 
and Ethuen?” 

“Nothing very much. Hule and 
I sat on an old couch that was 
turned backwards. Hule wanted 
to kiss me, and I let him. The 
Druidess found us and em- 
barrassed Hule dreadfully. She 
called me names: ‘harlot!’ 

‘Lilith!’ ‘nymph!’” Drusilla im- 
itated Wust’s peculiar grating 
voice to an exactitude. 

“And all heard?” 

“Yes. All heard.” 

“Who seemed the most upset?” 
Drusilla shrugged. “Sometimes 
I think one, then the other. Mario 
seems the softest. Ethuen has the 
least humor. Tanzel is sometimes 
sarcastic.” 

Obviously, thought Gersen, 
there had been much which he 
had missed. “Best that you do not 
hide with anyone, not even Hule. 
Be pleasant to each of the three, 
but prefer none.” 

Drusilla’s face became bleak 
and drawn. “I am frightened, 
really. When I was with the three 
women I thought I might run 
away. But I feared the poison in 
their rings. Do you think they 
would have killed me?” 

“I don’t know. But for now, go 
to bed and sleep. And open your 
door to no one.” 

Drusilla rose to her feet. With 
a final cryptic glance at Gersen 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



she went to the stairs, ascended 
to the balcony and entered her 
chamber. 

One by one the group dwindled, 
and at last Gersen sat alone gaz- 
ing into the dying fire, waiting for 
he knew not what. The balcony 
lights were dim; a balustrade ob- 
scured his vision. A shape drifted 
up to the door of one of the cham- 
bers, which quickly opened and 
closed. 

Gersen waited another hour, 
while the fire became embers and 
the wind blew spatters of rain 
against the dark windows. There 
was- no further activity. Gersen 
went to his own bed. 

XXII 

^"T^he chamber Which had receiv- 
ed the visitor, so Gersen 
noted the next morning, was that 
of Tralla Callob, the sociology 
student. He watched to see upon 
whom her eyes rested, but could 
be sure of nothing. 

This morning all wore similar 
costumes: gray suede trousers, a 
black blouse, a brown jacket, an 
intricate black hat Which was al- 
most a helmet, with ear-flaps flar- 
ing rakishly outward. 

Breakfast, like the meal of the 
nig'ht before, was simple and sub- 
stantial. As they ate the pilgrims 
cast appraising glances at the sky. 
Ragged patches of mist blew over 
the mountain; directly overhead 

149 




was a thin overcast, breaking at 
the east into tattered clots of 
nimbus, an outlook not too 
che*erful. 

After breakfast the steward 
marshaled the pilgrims, evading 
questions put to him. 

“How far must we walk to- 
day?” — this from Hygen Grote. 

“I really don’t know, sir. I have 
never heard the distance mention- 
ed. But the sooner we start, the 
sooner we arrive.” 

Hygen Grote gave a despon- 
dent snort. “This certainly wasn’t 
what I expected. Well, I’m as 
ready as I’ll ever be.” 

The path led south from the 
clearing; all turned to take a final 
look at the somber old lodge be- 
fore it passed from si#it. 

For several hours the trail 
wound through the woods. The 
sky remained overcast; the gray- 
miauve light which penetrated the 
trees invested the moss, the ferns, 
the occasional pale flowers, with 
a peculiarly rich color. Rocky 
outcrops began to be seen, with 
black and red lichen; everywhere 
were fragile little growths not dis- 
similar to the fungus of Earth, 
but taller and many-tiered', ex- 
haling a bitter, old ale smell 
when crushed. 

The path began to rise, the 
woods fell below. The pilgrims 
found themselves on a rock- 
strewn slope, with mountains 
looming to the west. At a stream 

158 



they paused to drink and catch 
their breath, and the steward dis- 
tributed sweet biscuits. 

To the east spread the forest, 
gloomy and dark; above loomed 
the mountain. Hygen Grote again 
deprecated the difficulty of the 
way, to which the guide made the 
blandest of replies: “There is 
much in what you say, Lord 
Grote. But as you know, I am 
only a servant, with orders to 
make the journey as convenient 
and interesting as possible.” 
“How can trudging these weary 
miles be interesting or conven- 
ient?” grumbled Grote, to be an- 
swered by Margray Liever: 
“Come now, Hygen. The scen- 
ery is delightful. Look at the view. 
And did you not enjoy the ro- 
mantic old lodge? I did.” 

“I am sure that this is the hope 
of the Margrave,” said the stew- 
ard. “And now. Lords and Ladies, 
best that we continue.” 

'"T^he trail slanted up the moun- 
tain slope; soon Druidess 
Laidig and Doranie were falling 
behind, and the steward courte- 
ously slowed the pace. The path 
entered a stony gulch, and the 
ascent became less steep. 

Lunch was brief and austere, 
consisting of soup, biscuits and 
sausage. Then once again the 
pilgrims set off along the trail. 
Wind began to strike down the 
mountainside, a few cold gusts 

GALAXY 




at a time; overhead, dark gray 
clouds raced to the east. Up the 
bleak mountainside plodded the 
pilgrims; and the city of Kouhi- 
la, the glass-hulled yacht, the 
green and gold wagon were only 
remote memories. Margray Lie- 
ver remained cheerful, and Nav- 
arth swxing along grinning as if 
at some malicious joke. Hygen 
Grote gave up complaining, sav- 
ing 'his breath for the exertion of 
moving up-hill. 

Halfway through the afternoon 
a rain squall drove the party to 
shelter under a jut of rock. The 
sky was dark; an unreal gray 
li^t washed the landscape. The 
pilgrims in their costumes of 
black and umber were as if de- 
rived from the same stxme and 
soil as the mountain itself. 

The trail entered a stony gorge. 
The pilgrims plodded forward in 
silence, the badinage and gentili- 
ties of the first few days put aside. 
There was another brief shower 
which the steward ignored, for 
the light was waning. The gorge 
widened, but the way ahead was 
blocked by a massive stone wall, 
topped by a row of iron spikes. 
The steward went to a black iron 
postern, raised a knocker, let it 
fall. After a long minute, the por- 
tal creaked back, to reveal 
a crooked old man in black gar- 
ments. 

The steward addressed the pil- 
grims. ‘Here is where I leave you. 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



The path lies beyond; you need 
only follow. Make the best haste 
posable, because darkness is not 
far away.” 

One by one the group passed 
throu^ the gap; the portal 
clanged shut behind them. For; a 
moment they milled uncertainly, 
looking this way and that. The 
steward and the old man had 
gone; there was; none to direct 
them. 

Diffiani pointed: “There, the 
path. It leads up toward the 
height.” 

P ainfully the pilgrims proceed- 
ed. The path traversed a 
stony barren, crossed a river, once 
more slanted up through the 
blowing wind. Finally, just as the 
light failed, the path came out 
on the ridge. Diffiani, in the lead, 
pointed ahead. “Li^ts. A hospice 
of some sort.” 

The group straggled forward, 
bending to the wind-gusts, turn- 
ing faces away from driven drops 
of rain. A long, low stone struc- 
ture bulked against the sky; one 
or two of the windows ^owed a 
wan yellow illumination. Diffiani 
found a door, pounded on it with 
his fist. 

It creaked open, and a wom- 
an peered forth. “Who are you? 
Why do you come so late?” 

“We are travelers, guests for 
the Palace of Love,” bawled Hy- 
gen Grote. “Is this the way?” 

151 












“Yes, this is the way. Enter 
then. Were you expected?” 

“Of course we were expected! 
Is there lodging for us here?” 
“Yes, yes,” quavered the old 
woman. “I can give you beds, but 
this is the old castle. You should 
have gone by the other path. En- 
ter then. I must look about. You 
have supped, I trust?” 

“No,” said Grote despondently, 
“we have not.” 

“Perhaps I can find gruel. 
What a shame the castle is so 
eold!” 

The pilgrims passed into a 
bleak courtyard, lit by a pair of 
feeble lamps. The old woman con- 
ducted them one at a time to 
tall-ceilinged chambers in various 
quarters of the castle. These were 
austere, gloomy, decorated to the 
precepts of some long-forgotten 
tradition. Gersen’s chamber con- 
tained a cot, a single lamp of red 
and blue glass. Three walls were 
black iron, relieved by i>attems 
of rust. In one of the walls was a 
door. The fourth wall was panel- 
ed in dark, waxed wood and 
carved with enormous, grotesque 
masks. There was neither fire nor 
heating; the room was chill. 

The old lady, breathless and 
anxious, told Gersen, “When food 
is ready you’ll be summoned.” 
She pointed to the door. “Yon- 
der is the bath, with precious lit- 
tle warm water. One must make 
do.” And she hurried away. Ger- 

153 



THE PALACE OF LOVE 



sen went into the bathroom, test- 
ed ithe shower; the water ran hot. 
He stripped off his clothes, bath- 
ed, then, rather than dressing in 
sodden clothes, he stretched out 
on the cot and covered himself 
with a quilt. Time passed; Ger- 
sen heard a distant gong strike 
nine times. There mi^t be sup- 
per; then again, there might not. 
Gersen turned over and went 
back to sleep. 

^^welve strokes of the gong. In- 
to the room came a slender 
maiden with silky blonde hair. 
She wore a skin-tight garment of 
blue velvet, blue leather slippers 
with rolled toes. 

Gersen sat up in bed. The 
maiden spoke, ‘We have now 
prepared a meal. All are arous- 
ed; all are siimmoned to eat.” 
She rolled* a wardrobe cart into 
the room. “Here are garments; 
do you require assistance?” With- 
out waiting for response she 
brought under-linen to Gersen. 
Presently he was clothed in beau- 
tiful fabric after a style quaint, 
ornate and complicated. The 
maiden dressed his hair, applied 
gallantry-disks to 'his cheeks, 
sprayed him with scent. “My 
Lord is magnificent,” she mur- 
mured. “And now: a mask, which 
tonight is of necessity.” 

The mask conasted of a black 
velvet casque fitting down to the 
ears, with a black visor, a nose- 

154 



cup, a chin-guard. Only Gersen’s 
cheeks, mouth and eyes were 
bare. 

“My Lord is now myster- 
ious as well,” said the maiden in 
the softest of voices. “I will lead 
you, for the way is by the old 
corridors.” 

She took him down a draughty 
staircase, along a dank, echoing 
coriidor, with only the feeblest 
of lamps to light the way. The 
walls, once splendid in patterns 
of magenta, silver and gold, were 
faded and blotched; the tiles of 
the floor were loose. 

The maiden halted by a heavy 
red portiere. She looked side- 
long at Gersen and put her finger 
to her lips. With the dim li^t 
glowing on her blue velvet gar- 
ment, glinting in her hair, she 
seemed dream-stuff, a creature 
too exquisite to be real. “Lord,” 
she said, “within is our banquet. 
I must urge you to mystery, for 
this is the game all must play 
and you may not speak your, 
name.” 

She pulled aside the portiere; 
Gersen stuped through* into a 
vast hall. From a ceiling so hi^ 
as to be unseen hung a single 
chandelier, casting an island of 
light around a great table laid 
with linen, silver and crystal. 

Here sat a dozen people in the 
most elaborate of costumes, wear- 
ing masks. Gersen examined 
them, but recognized none. Were

they his fdlows along the jour- 
ney? He could not be sure. Oth- 
ers entered the room. Now they 
came by twos and threes, all 
masked, all moving with an air of 
wonder. 

Gersen recognized Navarth, 
whose swaggering gait was unmis- 
takable. The girl, was she Drusil- 
la? He could not be certain. 

Forty people had entered the 
room, converging dowly upon 
the table. Footmen in silver and 
blue livery assisted all to seats; 
poured wine in the goblets, served 
from silver trays. 

Gersen ate and drank, aware 
of a peculiar confusion, almost 
bewilderment. Where and what 
was reality? The rigors of the 
journey seemed as remote as 
childhood. Gersen drank some- 
what more wine than he migjht 
have done under different circurn- 
stances. 

The chandelier exploded in a 
dazzling burst of green light, then 
went out. Gersen’s eyes projected 
orange after-images into the dark; 
from around the table came whis- 
pers and hisses of surprise. 

The chandelier slowly returned 
to normal. A tall man stood on 
a diair. He wore black garments 
and a black mask; he held a gob- 
let of wine in his hand. 

“Guests,” he said, “I make you 
welcome. I am Viole Falushe. 
You have attained the Palace of 
Love.” 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



46 T^ere are many varieties of 

* A love,” said Viole Falushe 
in a pleasant, husky voice. “The 
range is wide, and all have con- 
tributed to the creation of the 
Palace. Not all of my guests dis- 
cover this, and not every phase 
is yielded to them. For some the 
Palace will seem little more than 
a holiday resort Others will be 
haunted by what has been des- 
cribed as unnatural beauty! This 
is ever3rwhere: in every detail, 
every view. Others will revel in 
ardor, and here I must offer in- 
fonuation.” 

Gersen studied Viole Falushe 
with a rapt intensity. The tsall 
masked figure stood spare, 
strai^t, arms at sides. Gersen 
turned his head this way and 
that, trying to identify the figure, 
but the chandelier hanging di- 
rectly above the man distorted 
his contours. 

“The people at the Palace of 
Love are amiable, gay and beau- 
^ul and fall into two categor- 
ies,” said Viole Falushe. “The 
first are servants. They are pleas- 
ed to obey every wish of my 
guests, every whim or caprice. 
The second class, the happy peo- 
ple who inhabit the Palace, are as 
independent in their friendships 
as I myself. They ^e to be ident- 
ified by their garments, which 
are white. Your choice is wide.” 

155 




Gersen sought around the table, 
trying to find Xanzel, or Mario 
or Kthuen and thus eliminate 
them from suspicion. In this ef- 
fort he was unsuccessful. Among 
the forty were a dozen persons 
who might be any of the three. 
He turned back to listen to Viole 
Falushe. 

‘‘Are there restrictions? A per- 
son who went mad and began to 
kill would naturally be restrain- 
ed. Then again, all of us here 
cherish our privacy, one of our 
most delightful prerogatives. Only 
the most thou^tless person 
would intrude where he was not 
wanted. My personal apartments 
are sufficiently secluded; you 
need not apprehend an accidental 
intru^pn; this is almost impossi- 
ble.” yiole Falushe turned his 
head slowly, looked around the 
room. No one spoke; the room 
was heavy with expectancy. 

Viole Falushe spoke on. “So 
now: the Palace of Love! At times 
in the past I have arranged small 
dramas of which the participants 
were never aware. I have con- 
trived moods in artful sequence. 
I have employed tragic contrasts 
to heighten the delectation. On 
this occasion there will be no 
such program. You will be free 
to do as you like, to create your 
own dramas. I advise restraint. 
The rare jewels are the most pre- 
cious. The degree of austerity I 
myself practice would astound 

156 



you. My great pleasure is crea- 
tion; of this I never tire. Some 
of my guests have complained of 
a gentle melancholy which hangs 
in the air. I agree that the mood 
exists. The explanation, I believe, 
arises from the fugacity of beau- 
ty, the tragic pavanne to which 
all of us step. Ignore this mood; 
why brood, when there is so much 
love and beauty here? Take what 
is offered; have no regrets; a 
thousand years from now it will 
be all the same. Satiety is a prob- 
lem, but it is your own. I cannot 
protect you. The servants are to 
serve; command them. The resi- 
dents who wear white are to woo, 
to beguile. I pray that you do 
not become infatuated either 
with the Palace or its people; 
such a situation presents diffi- 
culties. You will not see me, 
though spiritually I am always in 
your midst. There are no spy de- 
vices, no sound transmitters, no 
vision cells. Upbraid me if you 
choose, revile me, praise me — I 
cannot hear. My only reward is 
the act of creation and the effect 
it produces. Do you wish to look 
forth on the Palace of Love? Turn 
then in your seats!” 

T he far wall slid away; day- 
light poured into the ball; 
before the guests spread a land- 
scape of mind-wrenching beauty: 
wide lawns, feathery green bower- 
trees, tall black cypress, twink- 

GALAXY 




ling birch; ponds, pools, marble 
urns; pavilions, terraces, rotun- 
das, constructed to an airy, de- 
licate architecture that seemed al- 
most to float. 

Gersen, like the others, had 
been startled by the sudden open- 
ing of the wall. Recovering, he 
jumped to his feet, but the man 
in black had disappeared. 

Gersen sought out Navarth. 
“Who was it? Mario? Tanzel? 
Ethuen?” 

Navarth shook his head. “I did 
not notice. I have been looking 
for the girl. Where is she?'’ 

With a sudden sinking feeling 
Gersen swung around. None of 
the people in the room was Dru- 
silla. “When did you see her 
last?” 

“When we arrived, when we 
came into the countr5^ard.” 

Already the journey seemed re- 
mote. Gersen muttered: “I hoped 
to protect her. I told her so. She 
trusted me.” 

Navarth made an impatient 
motion. “You could have done 
nothing.” 

Gersen went to the window, 
looked across the panorama. To 
the left was the sea, a group of 
distant islands. To the right 
moimtains reared ever higher 
and harsher, with cliffs falling to 
the valley floor. Below was the 
Palace: a loose grouping of ter- 
races, halls and pleasaunces. A 
door slid aside to reveal a des- 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



cending staircase. One by one the 
guests descended to the valley. 

T he precincts of the Palace oc- 
cupied a roughly hexagonal 
area perhaps a mile on a side. 
The base was the north cliff, with 
the Palace at its midpoint. The 
second side, clockwise, was de- 
marcated by a line of rocky crags, 
the gaps between -which were 
choked by rank, thorny thickets. 
The third side was white beach 
and warm blue sea. The fourth 
and fifth sides were less distinct 
and merged into the natural land- 
scape. The sixth side, angling 
back to the cliff, was demarcated 
by a line of carefully cultivated 
flower beds and fruit trees ar- 
ranged against a rude stone wall. 
Within the area were three vil- 
lages, innumerable glades, gar- 
dens, waterways. The guests wan- 
dered where they chose, spent the 
long days in whatever fa^on 
seemed most pleasurable. Bright 
mornings, golden afternoons, 
evenings and nights: one by one 
they drifted away. 

The servants, as Viole Falushe 
had implied, were acquiescent 
and possessed of great physical 
charm. The folk in white, even 
more beautiful than the under- 
servants, were innocent and will- 
ful as children. Some were cor- 
dial, some were perverse and im- 
pudent, all were unpredictable. It 
seemed as if their sole ambition 

157 




was to evoke love, to tantalize, to 
fill the mind with longing, and 
they became depressed only when 
guests found the under-servants 
preferable to themselves. They 
showed no awareness of the 
worlds of the universe and only 
small curiosity, though their 
minds were active and their 
moods mercurial. They thought 
only of love and the various lafe- 
pects of fulfillment. 

As Viole Falushe had hinted, 
infatuation too intense might lead 
to tragedy. Of this danger the 
people in white were gravdy 
aw'are, but made small effort to 
avoid the danger. 

The mystery of the Druids’ 
presence resolved itself. On the 
first day after arrival Dakaw, 
Pruitt, Laidig and Wust, with 
Hule and Billika in careful con- 
voy, explored the precincts and 
fixed upon a delightful little glade 
for their center of operations. To 
the back rose a line of black 
cypress, to right and left were 
lower trees and flowering dirubs, 
at the center was a great spad- 
dle-rooted oak. In front of the 
glade a pair of shelters was erect- 
ed, low domes of pale brown fiber. 
Here the group took up residence, 
and thereafter each morning and 
afternoon held evangelical meet- 
ings, expounding the nature of 
their religion to all Who came 
past. With great fervor they 
urged rigor, harshness, restraint 

158 



and ritual upon the folk of the 
garden, who listened politely 
enou^, but after the meetings 
enticed the Druids to relaxation 
and pleasure. Gersen decided that 
the whole affair was one of Viole 
Falushe’s wry jokes: a game he 
had dhosen to play with the 
Druids. The other guests arrived 
at the same conclusion and at- 
tended the meetings to judge 
whose doctrines would triumph. 

'"T^he Druids worked with great 
' intensity and built a fane of 
stones and twigs. Standing at the 
front, one or the other would cry 
out: ‘‘Must you aU then die to 
become dead? The mode to the 
Eternal is through minglement 
with a Vitality more enduring 
than your own. The source of all 
is the Triad Mag-Rag-Dag: Air, 
Earth -and Water. This is the 
Holy Immanence, which com- 
bines to produce the Tree of 
Life! The Tree is the wise, the 
vital, the enduring! Look at les- 
ser things: inserts, flowers, fish, 
man! See how they grow, bloom, 
lax>se, while the Tree in it placid 
wisdom lives on! Yea, you titillate 
your flesh, you gorge your sto- 
mach, you flood your brain with 
vapor. What then? How soon you 
die, while the noble Tree, with 
roots in Earth, holds innumber- 
able leaves to the glory of the 
sky! Forever! And when your 
flesh sags and withers, when your 

GALAXY 




nerves no longer leap, when your 
belly is sour, when your nose 
drips from -the liquor you have 
misused — then is no time to wor- 
ship the Treel No, no, no! For 
the Tree will have none of your 
corruption. All must be fresh and 
good. So worship! Give over 
the sterile cavortings, the animal 
gratifications! Worship the Tree!” 

The Palace folk listened with 
respect and awe. It was impos- 
sible to judge how deeply the 
Druid doctrine touched them. 
Meanwhile Dakaw and Pruitt be- 
gan to dig a great hole under the 
oak, burrowing down between the 
sprawled roots. Rule and Billika 
were not allowed to dig and flow- 
ed no disposition to do so. Indeed 
they watched the process with 
horrified fascination. 

The Palace folk, in their turn, 
insisted that the Druids partici- 
pate in their festivities, arguing: 
“You wish us to learn your ways, 
but in all fairness you must know 
the way we live too, so that you 
may judge our lives and see if 
after all we are corrupt!” Grudg- 
ingly the Druids acquiesced, sit- 
ting in a huddled group and 
maintaining the closest possible 
stiiotures upon Hule and Billika. 

The other guests watched with 
varied reactions. Skebou Diffiani 
attended the meetings with re- 
gularity and presently, to the 
astonishment of all, announced 
his intent to become a Druid. 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



Thereafter he donned black robe 
and cowl and joined the others 
at their rituals. Torrace daNossa 
spoke of the Druids with pitying 
contempt; Lerand Wible, who 
along the way had displayed an 
interest in Billika, threw up his 
arms in disgust and stayed away; 
Mario, Ethuen and Tanzel went 
their own ways and were seen but 
seldom. 

N avarth had become obsessed. 

He roved the garden, morose, 
dissatisfied, looking this way and 
that. He took no joy in the beau- 
ty of the garden and went so far 
as to sneer at Viole Falushe's ar- 
rangements. “There is no novelty 
here; the pleasures ore banal. 
There are no exhilarations, no 
staggering insights, no sublime 
sweep of mind. All is either gross 
or maudlin: the gratification of 
gut and gland.” 

“This may be true,” Gersen 
admitted. “The pleasures of the 
place are simple and undramatic. 
But what is wrong with this?” 
“Nothing. But it is not poetry.” 
“It is all very beautiful. To do 
Viole Falushe credit, he has 
avoided the macabre, the sadistic 
spectacles, which occur dse- 
where, and he «dlows his servants 
a certain degree <rf integrity.” 
Navarth made a sour grum- 
bling sound. ”You are an inno- 
cent. The more exotic pleasures 
he reserves for himself. Who 

159 




knows what goes on beyond the 
walls? He is a man to halt at noth- 
ing. And ‘integrity* in these peo- 
ple? Bathos! They are dolls, toys, 
confections! No doubt many are 
the little children extorted from 
Kouhila, those he did not sell to 
the Mahrab. And when they lose 
their youth, what then? Where do 
they go?** 

Gersen only shook his head. 
‘T don*t know.” 

“And where is Jheral Tinzy?** 
Navarth went on. “Where is the 
girl? What does he do with her? 
He has had her at his mercy.’* 
Gersen gave a grim nod. “I 
know.** 

“You know,” jeered Navarth, 
“but only after I reminded you. 
You are not only innocent; you 
are futile and foolish, no less than 
myself. She trusted you to protect 
her, and what have you done? 
Swilled and trolloped with the 
others, and this is the extent of 
your effort.” 

Gersen thought the outburst ex- 
aggerated but made a mild reply. 
“If I could contrive some feasible 
course of action, I would do so.” 
“And in the meantime?” 

“In the meantime I am learn- 
ing.” 

“Learning what?” 

“I find that none of the people 
here know Viole Falushe by 
sight. His offices seem to be some- 
where back in the mountains; I 
can find them nowhere in the val- 

160 



ley. I dare not try to cross the 
stone wall to the west, nor the 
thorn barrier to the east. I would 
certainly be apprehended and, 
journalist or not, dealt with harsh- 
ly. Since I have no weapons I 
can demand nothing. I must be 
patient. If I do not speak to him 
here at the Palace of Love, I will 
no doubt find opportunity else- 
where. 

“All for your magazine, eh?” 
“Why else?” asked Gersen. 

'"T^hey had come to the glade of 
' the Druids. Dakaw and 
Pruitt were delving as usual be- 
low the great oak, there they had 
excavated a Chamber tall enough 
for a man to stand erect. 

Navarth approached, peered 
down into the sweating dust- 
streaked faces. “What do you 
do down there, you burrowing 
Druids? Are you not pleased 
with the vista above ground that 
you seek a new viewix>int bdow?” 
“You are facetious,” said Pruitt 
coldly. “Be on your way. This 
is holy soil.” 

“How can you be so sure? It 
looks like ordinary dirt.” 

Neither Pruitt nor Dakaw made 
response. 

Navarth barked down, “What 
sort of mischief are you up to? 
This is no ordinary pastime.** 
“Go away, old poet,” said 
Pruitt. “Your breath is a pollu- 
tion and saddens the Tree.”

Navarth moved back and 
watched the digging from a little 
distance. do not like holeg in 
the ground,” he told Gersen. 
“They are impleasant. Look at 
Wible yonder. He stands as if he 
were overseer to the projectl” 
Navarth pointed toward the en- 
trance to the glade, where Wible 
stood, legs apart, hands clasped 
behind his back, whistling be- 
tween his teeth. Navarth joined 
him. “The work of the Druids 
enthralls you?” 

“Not at all,” said Lerand 
Wible. “They dig a grave.” 

“As I suspected. For whom?” 
“That I can’t be sure. Perhaps 
you. Perhaps me.” 

“I doubt if they will inter me,” 
said Navarth. “You may be more 
pliable.” 

“I doubt if they will enter any- 
one,” said Wible, whistling once 
more through his teeth. 

“Indeed? How can you be so 
sure?” 

“Come to the ‘consecration’ and 
see for yourself.” 

“When does this rite occur?” 
“Tomorrow night, so I have 
been informed.” 

XXIV 

T ittle music was to be heard 
on the grounds of his Palace; 
the quiet of the garden was as 
crystalline and clear as a dew- 
drop. But on the following morn- 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



ing the folk in white brought 
forth stringed instruments and 
for an hour played a wistful 
music rich with piangent over- 
tones. A sudden shower sent all 
hurrying to the shelter of a near- 
by rotunda, where they stood 
chattering like birds, peering up 
at the sky. 

Gersen, contemplating their 
faces, thought how frail was the 
connection between them and the 
guests. Did they know anything 
except frivolity and love? And 
there was the question raised by 
Navarth. What happened when 
they aged? Few in the garden 
were past the first bloom of their 
maturity. 

The sun came forth. The gar- 
den glinted with freshness. Ger- 
sen, drawn by curiosity, went to 
the Druids’ glade. Within one of 
the shelters he glimpsed Billika’s 
pale face. Then Wust came to 
stare at him from the doorway. 

The long afternoon passed. To- 
day a portent hung in the air, 
and imeasiness seemed to infect 
everyone. Evening arrived. The 
sun sank in a great tumult of 
clouds; gold, orange and red 
flamed overhead and far into the 
east. With the coming' of dusk, 
folk of the garden went to the 
Druids’ glade. To each side of the 
oak tree were fires, tended by 
Druidess Laidig and Druidess 
Wust 

Druid Pruitt emerged from his 

161 




shelter. He went to the fane and 
began his address. His voice was 
heavy and resonant; he paused 
frequently, as if to hear the echo- 
es of his words. 

Lerand Wible approached Ger- 
sen. ‘‘I am speaking to everyone 
in our group. Whatever happens, 
do not interfere. Do you agree 
to this?” 

“Naturally not.” 

“I didn’t think you would. Well 
then — ” 

Wible whispered a few words; 
Gersen grunted. Wible moved off 
to speak to Navarth, who tonight 
was carrying a staff. After Wible 
spoke, Navarth threw down his 
staff. 

“ — on each world a hallowed 
Tree! How does it become so? 
By the afflatus, by the concentra- 
tion of Life. Oh, worshipful 
Druids, who share the life of the 
First Germ, bring forth your awe, 
your most poignant dedication! 
What say we? Two are here, two 
have lived for this consecration. 
Come forth, Druids, go to the 
Tree!” From one shelter stagger- 
ed Rule, from the other Billika. 
Baffled, dull-eyed as if bewilder- 
ed or drugged, they stared this 
way and that, then saw the fires. 
Fascinated they approached, step 
by slow step. Silence was heavy 
in the glade. The two approach- 
ed the tree, looked at the fires, 
then descended into the hole be- 
low the tree. 

162 



“Behold!” called Pruitt. “They 
enter the life of the Tree — oh, 
blessed pair! — which now be- 
comes the' Soul of the World. Ex- 
alted children, lucky two! For- 
ever and ever stand in sun, in 
rain, by day, by night; help us 
to truth!” Druids Dakaw, Pruitt 
and Diffiani began to spade earth 
into the hole. They worked with 
gusto. In half an hour the hole 
was full, the soil banked around 
the roots. The Druids marched 
around the tree, holding brands 
from the fire. Each called forth 
an invocation, and the ceremony 
ended with a chant. 

''T^he Druids customarily break- 
' fasted at the refectory of the 
near village. The morning after 
the consecration they matched 
across the meadows, entered the 
refectory. Behind them came Hule 
and Billika. The Druids took 
their usual places, as did Hule 
and Billika. 

Wust was the first to notice. 
She F>ointed a trembling finger. 
Laidig screamed. Pruitt leapt 
away, then turned and ran from 
the refectory. Dakaw fell back 
like a half -filled sack; Skebou 
Diffiani, sitting bolt upright, 
stared in puzzlement. Hule and 
Billika ignored the consternation 
they had caused. 

Laidig, sobbing and gasping, 
reeled from the room, followed 
by Wust. Diffiani was the least 

GALAXY 




disturbed. He spoke to Hule. 
‘*How did you get out?” 

‘'By a tunnel,” said Hule. 
“Wible caused a tunnel to be 
dug.” 

Wible came forward. ^‘The ser- 
vants are here to be used. I used 
them. We dug a tunnd.” 

Diffiani nodded slowly. He 
reached up, took off his cowl, in- 
spected it, tossed it into a corner. 

Dakaw, roaring, rose to his feet. 
He struck once at Hule, knocking 
him to the floor, then aimed a 
tremendous blow at Wible, who 
stepped back, grinning. ‘‘Go back 
to your tree, Dakaw. Dig another 
hole and bury yourself.” 

Dakaw marched from the inn. 
Wust and Laidig were finally 
discovered, crouching in a bower. 
Pruitt had run south, beyond the 
precincts of the garden, and was 
seen no more. 

I n some fashion the episode 
with the Druids had broken a 
web. The guests, looking at each 
other, knew that the end of their 
visit was approaching, that soon 
they would be departing the 
Palace of Love. 

Gersen stood looking up at the 
mountains. Patience was well and 
good, but he might never be so 
close to Viole Falushe again. 

He pondered the small clues 
he had gleaned. It seemed 
reasonable to suppose that the 
banquet hall communicated with 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



Viole Falushe’s apartments. Ger- 
sen went to examine the portal 
at the foot of the stairs. It show- 
ed a blank, featureless face. The 
mountain-side above was un- 
climbable. 

To the east, where crags reared 
over the sea, Viole Falushe had 
set a thorn palisade. To the west 
the way was barred by a stone 
wall. Gersen turned to look 
south. If he made a long journey, 
circling the periphery of the 
garden, he would then be able to 
climb into the mountains, to ap- 
proach the area from above. 

This was the sort of purpose- 
less activity Gersen detested. He 
would be moving without knowl- 
edge, without plan. There must 
be some better method .... He 
could think of none. 

Very well, then: activity. He 
looked at the sun. Six hours of 
daylight remained. He must go 
far afield and trust to luck. If he 
were apprehended, he was Henry 
Lucas, journalist, in search of in- 
formation — a statement of s\if- 
ficient force imless Viole Falushe 
undertook to use a truth-extract- 
ing device. Gersen’s -flesh crawl- 
ed. The sensation annoyed him. 
He had become soft, diffident, 
over-wary. 

Reproaching himself first for 
cowardice, then for wilful reck- 
lessness, he set forth, walking 
south and heading away from 
the mountains.

XXV 

giarden ended at a grove 
' ■*“ of indigenous trees, of a tjrpe 
Gersen had not seen before: tall, 
gaunt organisms with pulpy 
black leaves, from which dripped 
a musty unpleasant sap. 

Fearing poison, Gersen breath- 
ed as €hallowly as possible. He 
was relieved to reach open ground 
with no other sensation than 
dizziness. To the east, toward the 
ocean, were orchards and culti- 
vated soil; to the west a dozen 
long sheds were visible. Barns? 
Warehouses? Dormitories? Keep- 
ing to the shadow of the trees 
Gersen walked west and present- 
ly came upon a road leading 
from; (the sheds toward the moun- 
tains. 

No living creature was in sight. 
The sheds seemed deserted. Ger- 
sen decided not to explore them; 
they certainly were not the head- 
quarters of Viole Falushe. 

Across the road was a wild 
area overgrown with thorny 
scrub. Gersen looked dubiously 
down the road. Best to travel by 
the banrens; there would be less 
chance of discovery. He ducked 
across the road, struck off toward 
the mountains. The afternoon 
sun shone bright. The scrub was 
host to swarms of small red mites 
whidi set up an impatient whir- 
ring sound when disturbed. Step- 
ping aroimd a hummock — a 

164 



hive or nest of some sort — Ger- 
sen came upon a bloated serpent- 
like creature with a face imcan- 
nily human. The creature saw 
Gersen with an expression of 
comical alarm, then, rearing 
back, displayed a proboscis from 
which it evidendy intended to 
eject a fluid. Gersen beat a quick 
retreat and thereafter walked 
more warily. 

The road veered west, away 
from the garden. Gersen crossed 
once more and took shelter un- 
der a cluster of yellow bladder- 
plants. He considered the moun- 
tain, tracing a route which would 
bring him to the ridge. Unfortun- 
ately, while climbing, he would be 
exposed to the gaze of anyone 
who happened by. 

No help for it. He took a last 
look around and, seeing nothing 
to dissuade him, set forth. 

The mountainside was steep, 
at times precipitious. Gersen 
made discouragingly slow pro- 
gress. The sun swung across the 
sky. Below spread the Palace of 
Love and the garden. Gersen’s 
chest pounded, and his throat felt 
numb, as if it had been anesthe- 
tized. The influence of the noxi- 
ous black-leaved forest? Ever 
higher, the panorama ever wider. 

For a space the way became 
easier, and Gersen angled toward 
the east, where presumably Viole 
Falushe maintained his head- 
quarters. Motion. Gersen stopped 

GALAXY 




short. From the corner of his eye 
he had seen — what? He could 
not be sure. The flicker had come 
from below and to his right. He 
scrutinized the face of the moun- 
tain and presently saw what 
otherwise might have evaded his 
attention: a deep cleft or fissure 
with a bridge between two arched 
apertures, the whole camouflaged 
by a stone wall. 



/Clutching and straining, Ger- 
sen angled down toward the 
cleft, finally reaching a point 
thirty feet above the walkway. 
There was no means to descend. 
He could go neither forward nor 
up nor down. His fingdrs were 
tiring, his legs were cramped. 

Thirty feet: too far to jump. 
He would break his legs. Out 
upon the bridge came a pale, 
stoop-shouldered man with a 
large, moist head, a clipped shock 
of black-gray hair. He wore a 
white jacket, black trousers. It 
was the white jacket, Gersen now 
realized, which had originally 
drawn his attention. If the man 
should look up, if a dislodged 
pebble should strike the bridge, 
Gersen was lost. 

The man moved into the op- 
posite aperture and out of sight. 
Gersen gave a fantastic gravity- 
defying leap, to throw himself in- 
to the angle of the cleft. He thrust 
out his legs, doubled his knees, 
pressing between the walls. Inch 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



by inch he let himself down, 
gratefully jumping the final six 
feet. He stretched, massaged sore 
muscles, then limped over to the 
western doorway, into which the 
man had disappeared. 

A white-tiled hall led back 
fifty yards, broken by areas of 
glass and occasional doorways. 
Beside one of these glass areas 
stood the stoop-shouldered man, 
peering at something which had 
attracted his attention. He raised 
his hand, signaled. From some- 
where beyond Gersen’s range of 
vision came a heavy-shouldered 
man with a thick neck, narrow 
head, a coarse yellow brush of 
hair, white eyes. The two looked 
through the glass, and the white- 
eyed man seemed to be amused. 

Gersen drew back. Crossing tiie 
walkway, he looked up the pas- 
sage to the east, to see a single 
doorway at the far end. The walls 
and floor were white tile; ornate 
lamps scattered rays and planes 
of various colors. 

With long stealthy strides Ger- 
sen went to the far door and 
touched the open-button. No re- 
sponse. He sought for code points, 
or a lock-hole, without success. 
The opening mechanism was con- 
trolled from the other side. In 
one sense, this was encouraging. 
The stoop-shouldered man had 
come this way, and it could only 
be to confer with whomever sat 
or stood beyond the door. 



165 




It would not do to attract at- 
tention. Yet Gersen must do 
something and quickly. At any 
m<Hnent one of the two men might 
approach, and he had nowhere to 
hide. He scrutinized the door 
with great care. The latch was 
nuagnetic; retraction was accom- 
plished by an electro-muscle. The 
escutcheon plate was fixed to the 
panel with adhesive. Gersen 
searched his pockets, but found 
nothing of utility. LiOping back 
down the hall, he reached up to 
the first lighting fixture, twisted 
loose a decorative metal cusp 
with a sharp point. Returning to 
the door he pried at the escutch- 
eon plate and presently snapped 
it free to reveal the mechanism 
of the open-button. The action 
was controlled from somewhere 
beyond the door. Gersen traced 
the circuit, and with the point of 
his metal cusp shorted across the 
relay contacts. He touched the 
button. The door slid aside, silent 
as a whisper. 

Gersen passed through the 
opening into and imoccupied 
foyer. He replaced the escutcheon 
plate and let the door slide shut. 

There was much to see. The far 
end of the room was ripple glass. 
To the left an archway opened 
upon a fli^t of stairs. To the 
ri^t were five cinematic panels, 
each displaying Jheral Tinzy in 
various guises at different stages 
of existence. Or were they five 

166 



different girls? One, wearing a 
short black skirt, was Drusilla 
Wayles; Gersen recognized the 
expression of her face, the droop 
to her mouth, the restless habit 
of tossing her head to the side. 
Another, a delightful imp in 
clown’s regalia, cavorted on a 
stage. A Jheral Tinzy of thirteen 
or fourteen in the translucent 
white gown of a sleepwalker 
moved slowly across an eerie set- 
ting of stone, black shadow, sand. 
A fourth Jheral Tinzy, a year or 
two younger than Drusilla, wore 
only a barbaric skirt of leather 
and bronze. She stood on a stone- 
flagged terrace and seemed to be 
performing a religious ritual. A 
fifth Jheral Tinzy, a year or two 
older than Drusilla, walked brisk- 
ly along a city street. 

Gersen glimpsed all this in the 
Space of two seconds. The effect 
was fascinating, but he could not 
spare time to look. For beyond 
the ripple glass wall was the dis- 
torted image of a tall, spare man. 

G ersen crossed the foyer on 
four silken strides. His hand 
went to the open-button of the 
door; he tensed, touched the but- 
ton. The door f ailed to open. Ger- 
sen exhaled a long slow sigh of 
frustration. 

The man turned his head 
^arply; aH Gersen could see was 
distortion and blur. “Retz? Back 
once more?” He jerked his head 

GALAXY 




suddenly forward; the glass was 
evidently permeable to his vision. 

“It's Henry Lucas, the journ- 
alist!” His voice took on a harsh 
edge. “There is a need for much 
explanation. What are you doing 
here? 

“The answer is obvious,” said 
Gersen. “I came here to interview 
you. There seemed no other way.” 

“How did you find my office?” 

“I climbed the mountain, jump- 
ed down where the walkway 
crosses the notch. Then I came 
along the passageway.” 

“Indeed, indeed. Are you a hu- 
man fly to traverse the cliff?” 

“It was not so difficult,” said 
Gersen. “There would be no other 
opportunity.” 

“This is a serious annoyance,” 
said Viole Falushe. “Do you re- 
call my comments on the subject 
of privacy? I am rigid on this 
score.” 

“Your comments were address- 
ed to your guests,” said Gersen. 
“I am here as a man with a job 
to do.” 

“Your occupation gives you no 
license to break laws,” Viole 
Falushe stated in a gentle voice. 
“You are aware of my wishes, 
which here, as elsewhere in the 
cluster, are law. I find your tres- 
pass not only insolent but inex- 
cusable. In fact, it goes far be- 
yond the brashness ordinarily 
tolerated in a journalist. It almost 
seems — ” 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



Gersen interrupted. “Please do 
not let your imagination domi- 
nate your sense of proportion. I 
am interested in the photographs 
in the foyer. They seem to be the 
likeness of the young lady who 
accompanied us on our journey, 
Navarth's ward.” 

“This is the case,” said Viole 
Falushe. “I have a strong interest 
in the young woman. I entrusted 
her upbringing to Navarth with 
unhapy results; she is a wanton.” 
“Where is she now? I have not 
seen her since we arrived at the 
Palace.” 

“She’s enjoying her visit in cir- 
cumstances somewhat different 
from yours,” said Viole Falushe. 
“But why your interest? She is 
nothing to you.” 

“Except that I befriended her 
and tried to clarify certain issues 
which she found confusing.” 
“And these issues were?” 

“You will allow me to use can- 
dor?” 

“Why not? You can hardly pro- 
voke me more than you already 
have.” 

“The girl was fearful of what 
might happen to her. She wanted 
to live a normal life, but did not 
care to risk retaliation for actions 
she could not avoid.” 

T riole Falushe’s voice trembled. 

^ “Is this how she spoke of rne? 
Only in terms of fear and ‘retali- 
ation?’ ” 



167 




“She had no reason to speak 
otherwise.” 

“You are a bold man, Mr« Lu- 
cas. Surely you know my r^u- 
tation. I subscribe to a doctrine 
of general equity: that he who 
commits a grievance must repair 
the effects of this act.” 

“What of Jheral Tinzy?” Ger- 
sen inquired, hoping to divert 
Viole Falushe. 

“^Jheral Tinzy’.” Viole Falu- 
she breathed the name. “Dear 
Jheral: as wilful and promiscuous 
as the unfortunate girl whom you 
befriended. Jheral could never 
quite repay the damage she 
wrought upon me. Oh, those wast- 
ed years!” Viole Falu^e’s voice 
quavered; grief lay near the sur- 
face. “Never could she requite 
her wrongs, though she did her 
best.” 

“She is aHve?” 

“No.” Viole Falu^e’s mood 
changed once more. “Why do 
you ask?” 

“I am a journalist. You know 
why I am here. I want a photo- 
graph of Jheral Tinzy for our ar- 
ticle.” 

“This is a matter I do not care 
to publicize.” 

“I am puzzled by the resem- 

.> _ 

blance between Jheral Tinzy and 
the girl Drusilla. Can you explain 
this?” 

“I could,” said Viole Falushe. 
“But I do not choose to do so. 
And there still remains your in- 

168 



trusion, which has shocked ixie, 
to such an extent that I demand 
retribution.” And Viole Faludhe 
leaned negligently back against on 
article of furniture. 

Gemen reflected a moment. 
Fli^t was futile. Attack was im- 
possible. Viole Falushe certainly 
carried a weapon; Gersen had 
none. Galling though the situa- 
tion might be, he must persuade 
Viole Falushe to change his 
mind. He tried a reasonable ap- 
proach. “Conceivably I violated 
the letter of your regulations, but 
what avail is an article on the 
Palace of Love without the com- 
ments of its creator? There is no 
communicating with you, since 
you choose to keep yourself aloof 
from your guests.” 

Viole Falushe seemed sur- 
prised. “Navarth knows my call- 
code well. A servant would have 
brought you a tdephone unit; you 
might have called me at any 
time.” 

“This did not occur to me,” 
said Gersen thoughtfully. “No, I 
had not considered the telephone. 
You say Navarth knows the 
code?” 

“Certainly. It is the same as 
that which I use on Barth.” 

“The fact remains,” said Ger- 
sen, “I am here. You have seen 
Part I of the projected article; 
Parts II and II are even more 
highly colored. If we want to pre- 
sent your point of view, it is im- 

GALAXY 




portant that we speak together. 
So open the door and we will dis- 
cuss the matter.” 

‘^No,” said Viole Falushe. ‘‘It 
is my whim to remain anony- 
mous, since I enjoy mingling with 
my guests .... Well, then,” he 
grumbled, “I suppose I must 
swallow my outrage. It is not just 
that you should evade your debt 
to me. Perhaps you will not in 
any event. For the moment, you 
may regard yourself as repriev- 
ed.” He spoke a soft word that 
Gersen did not hear; a door open- 
ed in the foyer. “Go within; this 
is my library. I will speak with 
you there.” 

XXVI 

ersen passed into a long room 
carpeted in dark green. A 
heavy table at the center support- 
ed a pair of antique lamps, a se- 
lection of current periodicals. One 
wall was lined with ancient 
books, the shelves sliding up or 
down through floor and ceiling 
to magazines above and below. 
There was a standard micro- 
reference system and a number 
of soft chairs. 

Gersen looked around with a 
trace of envy; the atmosphere 
was quiet, civilized, rational, re- 
mote from the hedonistic life of 
the Palace. A screen glowed to 
reveal Viole Falushe sprawling 
in a chair. A light threw his form 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



into silhouette; he was no more 
idezxtifiable now than before. 

“Very well then,” said Viole 
Falushe. “So here we are. You. 
have been making your photo- 
graphic records, I believe?” 

“I have several hundred pic- 
tures. More than necessary to 
cover those superficial aspects of 
the Palace which you display to 
your guests.” / 

Viole Falushe seemed amused, 
“And you are curious as to what 
else occurs?” 

“From a journalistic stand- 
point.” 

“Hm. What do you think of 
the Palace then?” 

“It is remarkably pleasant.” 
“You have a reservation?” 
“Something is lacking. Perhaps 
the flaws lies in your servants. 
They lack depth, they do not 
seem real.” 

“I recognize this,” said Viole 
Falushe. “They have no tra- 
ditions. The only remedy is time.” 
“They are also without resF>on- 
sibility. After all, they are 
slaves?” 

“Not quite, for they do not 
realize it. They consider them- 
selves the Fortunate Folk, and 
such they are. It is precisely this 
unreality, this sense of faerie, that 
I have been at pains to develop.” 
“And when they age, what 
then? What becomes of the For- 
tunate Folk?” 

“Some work the farms sur- 

169 




rounding the garden. Some are 
sent elsewhere." 

“To the real world? They are 
sold as slaves?" 

“All of us are slaves, in some 
wise." 

“How are you a slave?” 

4 4T am vicitim to a terrible ob- 
session. I was a sensitive 
boy cruelly thwarted; I daresay 
Navarth has provided the details. 
Rather than submit, I was forc- 
ed by my sense of justice to seek 
compensation — which I am still 
seeking. I am a man much 
maligned. The public considers 
me a voluptuous sybarite, an 
erotic glutton. The reverse is 
true. I am — why mince mat- 
ters? — absolutely ascetic. I must 
remain so until my obsession is 
rdieved. I am a man cursed. But 
you are not interested in my per- 
sonal problems, since naturally 
they are not for publication." 

“Nevertheless I am interested. 
Jheral Tinzy is the soiurce of your 
obsession?" 

“Precisely." Viole Falushe 
spoke in a measured voice. “She 
has blighted my life. She must 
expunge this blight. Is this not 
justice? To date she has proved 
imwilling, incapable." 

“How could die remove the ob- 
session?" 

Viole Palushe stirred fretfully. 
“Are you so uninmaginative? We 
have delved into this enough." 

170 



“So Jheral Tinzy is yet alive?” 

“Yes indeed." 

“But I understood you to say 
that she was dead." 

“Life, death: these are impre- 
cise terms." 

“Who then is Drusilla, the girl 
you left with Navarth? Is she 
Jheral Tinzy?" 

“She is who she is. She made 
a dreadful mistake. She failed, 
and Navarth failed, for Navarth 
should have schooled her. She is 
frivolous and wanton; she traf- 
ficked with other men, and she 
must serve as Jheral Tinzy 
served, and thus it shall be, ever 
and ever, until finally there is ex- 
piation, until I can feel soothed 
and whole. By this time there is 
a terrible score to pay. Thirty 
years! Think of it!" Viole Falu- 
she’s voice vibrated and cracked. 
“Thirty years surrounded by 
beauty, and incapable of enjoying 
it! Thirty long years!" 

“I would not presume to give 
you advice,” said Gersen, some- 
what drily. 

“I need no advice, and natural- 
ly what I tell you is in confidence. 
You would be ungracious to pub- 
lic it. I would be grieved and 
forced to demand satisfaction." 

“What then may I publish?" 

“Whatever you like, so long as 
I am not injured." 

“What of the other events here? 
What goes on at the other end of 
the hall?" 



GALAXY 




T riole Falushe considered him 
^ a moment. Gersen could sense 
but not see the smoulder in his 
eyes. But he spoke in a li^t 
voice: “This is the Palace of 
LfOve. I am interested in the sub- 
ject, even fascinated, through 
the mechanism of sublimation. I 
have an elaborate program of re- 
seardi under way. I explore the 
emotion in artificial and arbi- 
trary circumstances. I do not 
choose to discuss the matter any 
further at this time. Perhaps five 
years from now, or t^, I will 
publish a resume of my findings. 
They will provide fascinating in- 
sights.” 

“In regard to the photographs 
in tiie foyer — ” 

Viole Falushe jumped to his 
feet. “No more. We have talked 
too much. I find myself uneasy. 
You have provoked this, hence 
I have arranged a ^milar uneasi- 
ness for you, which will go far to 
soothe me. Thereafter: caution, 
discretion! Make the most of yoxir 
time, because shortly you must 
return to Reality.” 

“What of you? You remain 
here?” 

“No. I shall also leave the 
Palace. My work here is accom- 
plished, and I have an important 
mission on Alphanor, which well 
may change all .... Be so good 
as to step into the hall. My friend 
Helaunce awaits you.” 

Helaunce, thought Gersen. This 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



would be the white-eyed man. 
Slowly, with Viole Falui^e watch- 
ing him from the screen, Ger- 
sen turned, went to the door. 

The white-eyed man waited in 
the hall. He carried an object 
something like a flail: a rod 
terminating in a set of cords. He 
appeared to carry no other wea- 
pon. 

“Remove your clothes,” said 
Helaimce. “You are to be chas- 
tised.” 

“Best that you confine your 
chastisement to words,” said Ger- 
sen. “Revile me all you like; in 
the meantime let us return to the 
garden.” 

Helaunce smiled. “I have my 
orders. Be as difficult as you like; 
the orders must and will be car- 
ried out.” 

“Not by you,” said Gersen. 
“You are too thick and too slow.” 

Helaunce flourished the flail; 
the cords made a sinister crack- 
ling sound. “Quick, or you will 
make us impatient, and the pun- 
ishment will be commensurate.” 

Helaunce was hard and tough, 
Gersen noted, obviously a train- 
ed filter, perhaps as well trained 
as himself. Helaunce was also 
thirty pounds heavier. If he had a 
weakness, it was not apparent. 
Gersen suddenly sat down in the 
hall, put his hands to his face, 
began to sob. 

Helaunce stared in puzzlement. 
“Off with your clothes! Do not 

171 




sit there!'’ He came forward, 
nudged Gersen with his foot. 

Gersen jumped up with He- 
launce^s foot clamped to his chest. 
Helaunce hopped backward; Ger- 
sen gave the foot a cruel twist, 
applying torque to joints where 
muscles could interpose no pro- 
tection. Helaunce cried out in 
agony, fell flat. Gersen wrested 
loose the flail, struck him across 
the shoulder. The cords hissed, 
crackled; Helaunce muttered. 

‘If you can walk,” said Ger- 
sen, “be good enough to show 
me the way.” 

There was a step behind him: 
Gersen turned to glimpse a tall 
shape in black garments. Some- 
thing splashed purple-white light 
into his brain; Gersen toppled, 
dazed. 

^"T^ere was half an hour of 
nightmare. Gersen slowly re- 
gained control of his faculties. 
He lay naked in the Garden, be- 
side the white Palace wall. His 
clothes were stacked neatly be- 
side him. 

So much for that, thought Ger- 
sen. The project had failed — but 
not in disaster, for he still had 
his life. 

Gersen dressed himself, smiling 
grimly. There had been an at- 
tempt to humiliate 'him. It had 
not succeeded. He had paid, but 
pain, like pleasure, had no dura- 

172 



tion. Pride was an entity more 
persistent. 

Gersen leaned against the wall 
until his brain cleared. His nerves 
still throbbed to the terrible flail. 
There were no bruises, no lacera- 
tions: no ^ore than a few red 
welts. Gersen was hungry. And 
here was humiliation indeed: he 
must eat Vide Falushe’g food, 
walk through the pleasant garden 
that Viole Fdu^e’s brain had 
conceived. 

Gersen smiled again, even more 
wolfishly than before. He had 
known that hig life might not be 
altogether graceful and easy. 

The time was about dusk. The 
garden had never seenxed more 
beautiful. Fireflies moved in the 
jasmine bushes; marble urns 
glowed against dark foliage as if 
exuding wan light of their own. 
A troupe of girls from one of the 
villages came capering i>ast. To- 
night they wore loose white 
pantaloons and carried yellow 
lanterns. Seeing Gersen they cir- 
cled around him singing a gay 
song, the words of which Gersen 
could not comprehend. One ap- 
proached, held her lantern to 
Gersen's face. “Why so strange, 
guest-man? Why so gray? Come 
frolic, come join us!” 

“Thank you,” said Gersen. “I 
fear tonight I would frolic very 
poorly indeed.” 

“Kiss me,” coaxed the girl. 
“Am I not beautiful? Why are 

GALAXY 




you so sad? Because you must 
leave, forever and ever, the 
Palace of Love? And we will re- 
main, and always be young and 
always carry our lanterns through 
the night. Is this why you grieve?” 
Gersen smiled. “Yes, I must re- 
turn to a far world. And I am 
forlorn at the thought. But do not 
let me interfere with your joy.” 
The girl kissed his cheek. “To- 
night is your last night, your last 
night at the Palace of Love! To- 
ni^t you must do all you have 
neglected so far; never will there 
be another time!” 

The girls continued on their 
way, with Gersen looking after 
them. “Do all I have neglected? 
I wish I could . .” He went to 
a sunken terrace where guests sat 
dining. Navarth crouched alone 
over a bowl of goulash; Gersen 
joined him. An attendant wheeled 
forth a cart; Gersen, who had not 
eaten since morning, served him- 
self. 

Navarth finally spoke: “What’s 
happened? You appear well 
used.” 

“I spent an afternoon with our 
host.” 

“Indeed. You spoke to him face 
to face?” 

“Almost so.” 

“And you know then his iden- 
tity? Mario? Ethuen? Tanzel?” 
“I can’t be sure.” 

Navarth grunted and bent 
once more to the goulash. 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



“Tonight is the last night,” 
Gersen said presently. 

“So they tell me. I will be glad 
to go. There is no i>oetry here. It 
is as I have always set forth. Joy 
comes of its own free will; it 
cannot be belabored. Look! A 
great palace, a magnificent gar- 
den with live nymphs and heroes. 
But where is the dreaming, the 
myth? Only simple-minded folk 
find joy here.” 

“Your friend Viole Falushe 
would be sorry to hear you say 
this.” 

“I cannot say less.” Navarth 
turned Gersen a sudden diarp 
look. Did you ask for the girl?” 
“T did. I learned nothing.” 
Navarth closed his eyes. “I 
have become an old man, I am 
ineffectual. Henry Lucas, what- 
ever your name, cannot you act?” 
“Today I tried,” said Gersen. 
“I was not made welcome.” 

The two sat in silence. Then 
Gersen asked, “When do we 
leave?” 

“I know no more than you.” 
“We will do what we can.” 

XXVII 

^"T^he last night at the Palace of 
* ^ Love was celebrated by a 
fete. There was music, intoxicat- 
ing fumes, a whirl of dancers 
from the villages. Those who had 
formed attachments made woeful 
conversation or indulged in a 

173 





174 



GALAXY 







final frenzy of passion. Others 
sat quietly, each in his private 
mood, and so passed the night. 
One by one the colored lights 
blinked and dimmed; the folk in 
wlhite slipped away through the 
garden gloom; one by one the 
guests took themselves to their 
couches, alone or in the company 
that pleased them most. 

The garden was quiet, and dew 
began to form on the grass. To 
each of the guests went a ser- 
vant. “The time has come to 
leave.” 

To grumblings and protests the 
servants made but one reply: 
“These are our orders. The air- 
oar waits; those who are not on 
hand must walk their way back 
to Kouhila.” 

The guests once more were pro- 
vided new clothing: an austere 
costume of blue, black and dark 
green. They were then guided to 
an area somewhat south of the 
Palace where a large aircar wait- 
ed. Gersen counted. All were here 
except Pruitt and Drusilla. Ethu- 
en, Mario and Tanzel stood near- 
by. If one were Viole Falushe, 
it seemed that now he planned to 
return to the Oikumene with the 
others. 

Gersen went forward, glanced 
into the pilot’s compartment. 
Here sat Helaunce. The guests 
were filing into the aircar. Ger- 
sen took Navarth aside. “Wait.” 

“Why?” 



THE PALACE OF LOVE 



175 



“No matter.” Tanzel and 
Ethuen were aboard; now Mario 
climbed the ladder. Gersen spoke 
hurriedly. “Go aboard. Make a 
disturbance. Pound on the bulk- 
head. Shout. There is an emergen- 
cy lock between the saloon and- 
the pilot’s compartment. Pull this 
open. Distract the pilot; try not 
to incite either Mario, Ethuen or 
Tanzel. They must not be en- 
couraged to interfere.” 

Navarth looked at him blank- 
ly. “What is the use of this?” 
“No matter, do as I say. Where 
is Drusilla? Where is Jheral Tin- 
zy? Why are they not aboard?” 
“Yes, why are they not aboard? 
I am truly outraged.” Navarth 
jumped up the ladder, thrust- 
ing aside the Druidess Laidig. 
“Wait!’ he called. “We are not 
all present. Where is Zan Zu 
from Eridu? We cannot leave 
without her. I refuse to leave; 
nothing will remove me.” 

“Quiet, old fool,” growled Tor- 
race daNossa. “You do no good.” 
Navarth raged back and forth. 
He struck on the forward bulk- 
head, pulled on the handle of 
the commimicating door. Finally 
Helaunce opened the door, went 
aft to enforce order. “Old man, 
sit quietly. It is by order that we 
now leave. Unless you care to 
walk the long road, sit quiet.” 
“Come then, Navarth,” said 
Lerand Wible. “You achieve 
nothing. Sit quietly.” 

176 



“Very well,” said Navarth. “I 
have protested. I have done all I 
can; I can do no more.” 

T Telaunce returned forward. He 
^ backed into the pilot’s com- 
partment, closed the door. Ger- 
sen, wa,iting to the side, struck 
him over the head with a stone. 
Helaunce staggered, spun around. 
He saw Gersen through eyes 
blinded by blood and gave an in- 
articulate cry. Gersen struck 
again, and Helauce fell aside. 

Gersen settled himself at the 
controls. Up rose the aircar, up 
into the light of the rising sun. 
Gersen searched Helaunce, found 
two projacs Which he tucked into 
his own pocket. Slackening speed 
until the aircar only drifted, he 
slid open the door, rolled He- 
launce out and away. 

In the saloon, thought Gersen, 
Viole Palushe must be wondering 
as to the peculiar course He- 
launce was steering. Gersen 
sought around the ocean and 
presently spied a small island 
some twenty miles from the shore. 
He circled it and seeing no sign 
of habitation landed the aircar. 

He jumped to the groimd. Go- 
ing to the saloon port, he pulled 
it open, jumped inside. “Every- 
body out. Quick.” And he gestur- 
ed with the projacs. 

Wible stuttered, “What does 
this mean?” 

“It means every body out.” 

GALAXY 




Navarth jumped to his feet. 
‘‘Come along,” he bawled. 
“Everybody out.” 

The guests uncertainly filed 
outside. Mario came to the door. 
Gersen halted him. “You must re- 
main. Be very careful and do not 
move, or I will kill you.” 

Tanzel came by, and Ethuen; 
both were intercepted, ordered to 
sit. Finally the saloon was empty 
but for Gersen, Mario, Tanzel 
and Ethuen. Outside Navarth ex- 
citedly harangued the group. 
“Make no interference or you will 
regret it! This is IPCC business; 
I know it for a fact!” 

“Navarth!” Gersen called from 
the saloon. “Your assistance, 
please.” 

Navarth climbed back into the 
saloon. He searched Mario, Tan- 
zel and Ethuen, while Gersen 
stood vigilantly by. No weapons, 
no clues to the identity of Viole 
Falushe were discovered. To Ger- 
sen’s direction, Navarth tied the 
three men to chairs using various 
oddments of cord, strips of fab- 
ric and thongs. Meanwhile the 
three excoriated Gersen and de- 
manded the basis for his persecu- 
tion. Tanzel was the most ver- 
bose, Ethuen the most acrimoni- 
ous, Mario the most enraged. 
All glared and cursed with equal 
vigor. Gersen accepted the re- 
marks with equanimity. “I will 
apologize to two of you later. 
Those two, aware of their inno- 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



cence, will cooperate with me. 
From the third man I expect 
trouble. I am prepared for it.” 
Tanzel asked, “In Jehu’s name, 
then: what do you wish of us? 
Name your third man and have 
done!” 

“Vogd Filschner is his name,” 
said Gersen. “Otherwise known 
as Viole Falushe.” 

“Why pick on us? Go seek 'him 
at the Palace!” 

Gersen grinned. “Not a bad 
idea.” He tested the bonds of the 
three men, tightened here, re- 
knotted there. “Navarth, you sit 
here, to the side. Watch these 
three carefully. One of them took 
Jheral Tinzy from you.” 

“Tell me which one.” 

“Vogel Filschner. You don’t 
recognize him?” 

“I wish I could.” He pointed 
to Mario. “This one has his shif- 
ty eye.” He indicated Tanzel’s 
hands. “This one has a mannerism 
I remember in Vogd.” He turned 
to inspect Ethuen. “And this one 
has a store of spite and clearly 
is unhappy.” 

“Certainly I’m unhappy!” 
snapped Ethuen. “Why should I 
rejoice?” 

“Watch them well,” said Ger- 
sen. “We return to the Palace.” 

I gnoring the outcries of the ma- 
rooned guests, he took the air- 
car aloft. So far so good — but 
what next? Conceivably his rea- 

177 




soning was awry; conceivably 
neither Tanzel, nor Mario, nor 
Ethuen was Viole Falushe. 
Thinking back over the circum- 
stances of the journey to the 
Palace, he discarded the notion. 

The best method of ingress to 
the apartments of Viole Falushe 
was from above; Gersen had no 
stomach for another climb 
around the cliff. He landed the 
aircar beside the stone castle 
and went back into the saloon. 
All was as before. Navarth sat 
glaring at the three captives, who 
regarded him with loathing. 

Gersen gave Navarth one of 
the projacs. ‘Tf there is difficulty 
kill all three. I go to look for 
Drusilla and Jheral Tinzy. You 
must guard with care!” 

Navarth laughed wildly. “Who 
can trick a mad poet? I know 
him this instant; I intend to keep 
the weapon at his throat.” 

Gersen could not restrain a 
sense of misgiving. Navarth was 
not the most stable of guardians. 
“Remember! If he escapes, we 
are lost. He may want a glass of 
water; let him thirst. His bonds 
may be too tight. He must suf- 
fer! Show no mercy if there is 
interference from outside. Shoot 
all three.” 

“With pleasure.” 

“Very well. Keep your mad- 
ness in check till I return!” 
Gersen went to the door 
through which three weeks pre- 

178 



viously the sodden band of pil^ 
grims had entered. The doot: was 
locked; he blasted away the hard- 
ware and entered. 

There was no sound. The dank 
rooms were empty. Gersen went 
down the haU, descended by the 
way the girl in blue velvet had 
taken him and finally foimd the 
banquet room, now dim, smelling 
faintly of perfume and wine. 

Gersen moved more cautiously. 
From the banquet room a way 
led down to the garden. Another 
must lead to Viole Falushe^s 
apartments. 

Gersen checked the walls and 
finally, behind a hanging, found 
a narrow door of heavy wood 
barred with metal. Once again 
he burnt his way through. 

A spiral staircase led down into 
the chamber to the back of 
the circular foyer. 

Gersen searched the room. He 
found a black leather notebook 
containing exhaustive notes upon 
the psychology of Jheral Tinzy, 
and the various methods by which 
Viole Falushe hoped to win her. 
It seemed that Viole Falushe 
wanted more than love : he want- 
ed submission, abject quivering 
absement, derived from a min- 
gling of love and fear. 

So far, reflected Gersen, Viole 
Falushe had fallen short in his 
goal. He tossed the portfolio 
aside. On the wall was a tele- 

GALAXY 




screen. Gersen turned a knob. 
Drusilla Wayles wearing a white 
robe sat on a bed. She was pale, 
thin, but apparently unharmed. 

Gersen turned the knob. He 
looked out upon a gloomy area 
of sand among tall rock pinnacles. 
To the back were five dark 
deodors and a little cabin hardly 
larger than a dollhouse. Sitting 
on a bench was a girl about four- 
teen years old, a girl almost iden- 
tical to Drusilla. She wore a 
transparent white gown; her face 
had a peculiarly sweet, peculiar- 
ly pensive expression, as if she 
had only just awakened from a 
pleasant dream. From the side 
came a tall nonhuman creature, 
walking on thin black furred legs. 
It stopped beside the girl, spoke 
in a thin high-pitched voice. The 
girl resiK>nded without interest. 

Gersen turned the knob again, 
to bring into view a terrace in 
front of what appeared to be a 
temple. Inside could be glimpsed 
the statue of a divinity. On the 
steps stood another DrusiHa, this 
one sixteen years old, wearing 
only a kirtle and a copper fillet 
to confine her hair. Elsewhere 
were other men and women, sim- 
ilarly dressed. To the side was 
the suggestion of a shore, with 
water beyond. 

Gersen turned the knob again, 
again, again. He looked into 
various environments, various 
types of rooms and cages. They 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



contained an assortment of boys* 
girls, youths, maidens, young men 
and women, sometimes separate,; 
sometimes together. Here were 
Viole Falushe’s experiments, from 
which he evidently extracted a 
voyeur’s pleasure. But Gersen 
saw no more versions of Drusilla. 

Urgency prickled at his nerves, 
stemming from his lack of faith 
in Navarth; he set off along the 
hall and crossing the bridge, en- 
tered the laboratory section to 
the west. Here was the locale of 
the experiments, in cages and 
chambers behind one-way mir- 
rors. 

G ersen found Retz, the stoop- 
shouldered technician, sitting 
in a small office. He looked up 
startled at the sight of Gersen. 
“What do you do here? Are you 
a guest? The master will be dis- 
pleased!” 

“I am master now.” Gersen dis- 
played the projac. “Where is the 
girl who resembles Jheral Tin- 
zy?” 

Retz blinked, half-defiant, half- 
doubtful. “I can teU you nothing.” 
Gersen struck him with ^the 
gun. “Quick. The girl who came 
here three weeks ago.” 

Retz began to whine. “What 
can I tell you? Viole Falushe will 
punish me.” 

“Viole Falushe is a prisoner.” 
Gersen leveled the gun. “Take 
me to the girl, or I will kill you.” 

179 




Retz made a despairing sound. 
‘‘He will do terrible things to me.” 
“No longer.” 

Retz waved his arms, walked 
down the corridor. Suddenly he 
stopped, turned around. “You say 
he is your prisoner?” 

“He is.” 

“What do you plan to do with 
him?” 

“Kill him.” 

“And what of the Palace?” 
“We shall see. Take me to the 
girl.” 

“Will you leave me here, in 
charge of the Palace?” 

“I will kill you unless you 
make haste.” 

Disconsolately Retz moved on. 
Gersen spoke to him. “What has 
Viole Falushe done to her?” 
“Nothing yet.” 

“What did he plan?” 

“An autofertlization: a virgin 
birth, so to speak. In due course 
she would bear a female child 
precisely like herself.” 

“Jheral Tinzy gave birth to her 
in this way?” 

“Exactly.” / 

“And how many others?” 

“Six others. Then she killed 
herself.” 

“Where are the other five?” 
“Ah! As to that I can’t say.” 
Retz was lying, but Gersen al- 
lowed the statement to go un- 
challenged. 

Retz paused by a door, looked 
craftily over his shoulder. “The 

180 



girl is within. Whatever she re- 
ports, you must remember that I 
am only an underling; I only 
obey orders.” 

“Then you’ll obey mine. Open 
the door.“ Retz hesitated a final 
instant, with a glance over Ger- 
sen’s shoulder down the hall, as 
if hoping against hope for succor. 
He sighed, slid back the door. 
Drusilla, sitting on the bed, look- 
ed up with alarm. She saw Ger- 
sen; her expression changed from 
astonishment to joy. She jumped 
up from the bed, ran to Gersen, 
sobbed in relief. “I hoped you’d 
come. They’ve done such dread- 
ful things to me!’ 

R etz, thinking to take advan- 
tage of Gersen’s distraction, 
started to slink away. Gersen call- 
ed him back. “Not so fast. I have 
use for you.” He spoke to Drusil- 
la. “Has Viole Falushe shown 
himself to you? Will you recog- 
nize him?” 

“He came to stand in the door- 
way with the light at his back. 
He did not want me to see him. 
He was savage, he hated me. He 
said I had been faithless. I asked 
how this was possible since I had 
promised him nothing. He be- 
came absolutely cold. He said 
that it had been my duty to wait, 
to maintain my ideals, until he 
had come. And even then, he said, 
I had played him false, at Na- 
varth’s party and on the trip.” 

GALAXY 




Gersen said, ‘‘One thing is cer- 
tain then: he is Tanzel or Ethuen 
or Mario. Which did you like the 
least?’’ 

“Tanzel.” 

“Tanzel, eh? Well, Retz here 
will show us certainly which is 
Viole Falushe, will you not, 
Retz?” 

“How can I? He has never 
shown himself to me, except be- 
hind the glass of his office.” 

Unlikely, thought Gersen. Still, 
not impossible. “Where are the 
other daughters of Jheral Tinzy?” 

“Six there were,” muttered 
Retz. “Viole Falushe killed the 
two oldest. There is one on Al- 
phanor. This one — ” he indi- 
cated Drusilla “ — was sent to 
Earth. The youngest is to the 
east of the Palace, where the 
mountains meet the sea. The next 
is priestess to the god Arodin, on 
the large island directly to the 
east.” 

“Retz,” said Gersen, “I hold 
Viole Falushe a captive. I am 
your new master. Do you under- 
stand this?” 

Retz nodded sulkily. “If this 
is how it must be.” 

“Can you identify Viole Falu- 
she?” 

“He is a tall man. He has dark 
hair. He can be harsh or soft; 
cruel or easy. Beyond that I do 
not know.” 

“These are my orders to you. 
Liberate these poor captives.” 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



“Impossible!” fluted Retz. 
“They know no other life than 
their peculiar environments. The 
open 'air, the sun, the sky — they 
would go mad!” 

“This is your task then. As 
gently and ^easily as possible, 
bring them forth. I will return 
shortly and see how well you 
have done your job. Further, 
make known to the folk in the 
garden that they are no longer 
slaves, that they are free to go or 
stay. Mind you, I will pen you in 
a doset and punish you for your 
crimes if you do not obey me.” 
“I will obey,” muttered Retz. 
“I am accustomed to obedience; 
I know nothing else.” 

Gersen took Drusilla by the 
arm. “I worry about Navarth. We 
dare not be gone too long.” 

XXVIII 

B ut when they returned up 
through the castle and out 
to the aircar, circumstances 
were as before. The three cap- 
tives were secure, and Navarth 
held the weapon unblinkingly at 
their heads. His eyes glowed at 
the sight of Drusilla. “What of 
Jheral Tinzy?” 

“She is dead. But she had 
daughters. There are others. 
What has transpired while I was 
gone?” 

“Talk. Blandishments. Persua- 
sion. Threats.’” 

181 




“Of course. Who was most in- 
sistent?” 

“Tanzel.” 

Gersen turned Tanzd. a cool 
inspection. Tanzel shrugged. “Do 
you think I enjoy sitting here 
trussed like a chicken?” 

“One of you is Viole Falushe,” 
said Gersen. “Which? I won- 
der. Well, we must undo 
more of the dreadful misdiief per- 
formed in the name of love.” 

He took the airoar aloft, 
cruised slowly east over the 
mountains. At the ocean’s edge, 
where the crags submerged into 
the water, a gloomy defile open- 
ed upon a narrow gray beach. Be- 
hind was a sandy open area pei^ 
haps an acre in extent. Gersen 
lowered the aircar into the shad- 
ows and landed. He jiunped 
out. Drusilla IV, the youngest of 
the group, came slowly forward. 
From a fissure to the back, two 
nonhuman nurse-maids made 
angry chattering sounds. The girl 
asked, “Are you The Man? The 
Man who is to love me?” 
Gersen grinned. “I am a man, 
true enough. There are many men 
in the world. Who is ‘The Man?’ ” 
Drusilla IV looked vaguely 
toward the fissure. “They have 
told me of The Man. There is 
one of me and one of him, and 
when I see him I must love him. 
This is what I have learned.” 
“But you have never seen 
this ‘man?’ ” 

182 



“No. You are the first ‘man’ 
I have wer seen. The first person 
like mysdf. You are wonderfull” 
“Ihere are many men in the 
world,” said Gersen. “They told 
you a falsehood. Come aboard, I 
will show you other men and a 
girl like yourself.” 

Drusilla IV looked around the 
dreary defile in alarm and be- 
wilderment. “Will you take me 
from here? I am frightened.” 
“You need not be,” said Ger- 
sen. “Come aboard now.” 

“Of course.” She took his hand 
trustingly and entered the saloon. 
At the sight of the passengers she 
halted in astonishment. “I never 
knew so many people existed!” 
She examined Mario, Ethuen 
and Tanzel critically. “I don’t 
like them. They have foolish 
wicked faces.” She turned to Ger- 
sen. “I like you. You are the 
first man I have ever seen. You 
must be The Man, and I will stay 
with you forever.” 

G ersen watdhed the faces of 
Mario, Ethuen, Tanzel. This 
must make poor hearing for 
Viole Falushe. All sat stony- 
faced, glaring at Gersen with 
equal degrees of detestation. Ex- 
cept, at the corner of Tanzel’s 
mouth, a tiny muscle twitched. 

Gersen took the airoar aloft 
and flew out toward the largest 
of the islands and almost imme- 
diately spied the temple looming 

GALAXY 




above a village of cane and frond. 
Gersen landed the aircar in the 
square, while villagers watched 
in amaz6nent and alarm. 

From the temple sauntered 
Drusilla III, a girl confident and 
self-possessed, exactly identical to 
the other Drusillas, yet in some 
sense different, as the other two 
were different. 

Once more Gersen alighted 
from the air- car. Drusilla III in- 
spected him with candid interest. 
“Who are you?’’ 

“I come from the mainland,” 
said Gersen. “I come to speak 
to you.” 

“You want a rite performed? 
Go elsewhere. Arodin is impo- 
tent. I have beseeched him to 
send me elsewhere, among other 
boons. There is no response.” 
Gersen looked into the temple. 
“That is his likeness within?” 
“Yes. I am priestess to the 
cidt.” 

“Let us go look at the image.” 
“There is nothing to see: a 
status sitting on a thome.” 
Gersen went into the temple. 
At the far end sat a figure twice 
as large as life. The head was 
rudely defaced: nose, ears, chin 
broken away. Gersen turned to 
Drusilla III in wonder. “Who 
damaged the statue?” 

“I did.” 

“Why?” 

“I did not like his face. Ac- 
cording to the-Rote, Arodin must 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



come in the flesh to take me for 
his bride. I am enjoined to pray 
to the statue for the earliest 
nuptials possible. I broke the face, 
to delay the process. I do not 
like being a priestess, but I am 
allowed to be nothing else. I 
hoped that after I defiled the 
image another priestess might be 
appointed. This has not occurred. 
Will you take me away?” 

“Yes. Arodin is no god, he is a 
man.” Gersen took Drusilla III 
into the saloon, x>^inted out 
Mario, Ethuen, Tanzel. “Observe 
the three men. Does one of them 
resemble the statue of Arodin, be- 
fore you defaced it?” 

One of the men blinked. 

“Yes,” said Drusnia III “Yes 
indeed. There is the face of Aro- 
din.” She pointed to Tanzel, the 
man who had blinked. 

^'T^nzel cried out, “Here, here! 
' What’s going on? What are 
you trying to do?” 

“I want to identify Viole 
Falushe,” said Gersen. 

“Why pick on me? I’m not 
Arodin, nor Viole Falushe, nor 
yet Beelzebub, for that matter. 
I’m good old Harry Tanzel of 
London, no more, no less, and 
I’ll thank you to take these ropes 
from my arms.” 

“In due course,” said Gersen, 
He turned to Drusilla III. 
“You’re sure that he is Arodin?” 
“Of course. Why is he tied?” 

183 




suspect him of being a crim- 
inal.’^ 

Drusilla III laughed, a clear 
merry sound. ‘‘What a dreadful 
joke! A man like that putting up 
a statue to himself and calling 
himself a god! What did he hope 
to gain?” 

“You.” 

“Me? All this effort for me?” 
“He wanted you to love him, 
to worship him.” 

Again Drusilla Ill’s laughter 
rang through the ship. “A great 
deal of wasted effort.” 

And Gersen, watching closely, 
thought to see a pink flush seep 
across Tanzel’s face. “You are 
ready to leave here?” 

“Yes. Who are these other 
girls, who so resemble me?” 
“Your sisters.” 

“How strange.” 

“Yes. Vide Falushe — or Aro- 
din, if you refer — is a strange 
man.” 

Gersen took the air-car aloft, 
set it to cruising slowly on the 
automatic pilot while he cogi- 
tated. Still no absolute proof to 
the identity of Viole Falushe. A 
twitch of the mouth, a seep of 
color, a defaced countenance. In- 
teresting, but hardly incontrover- 
tible evidence. Essentially he was 
no closer to the identity of Viole 
Falushe than when he set out 
on the journey. 

He looked back into the saloon. 
The three girls were holding a 

184 



somewhat guarded conversation. 
Navarth had become bored with 
his duties and was watdhing the 
girls with a half -expectant, half- 
forlom expression: perhaps by 
some miracle they would merge 
to become his own precious Jher- 
al Tinzy. 

Gersen sifted his courses of ac- 
tion. They were few. If he had 
access to one or another of the 
truth drugs, Viole Falushe’s iden- 
tity would emerge swiftly enough. 
There was no one at the Palace 
of LfOve who could recognize 
Viole Falushe, probably no one 
at the cities Atar or Kouhila. On 
Earth Navarth knew Viole Falu- 
she’s call-code .... Gersen 
rubbed his chin. “Navarth!” 

Navarth came into the pilot’s 
compartment. Gersen indicated 
the commxinication system, gave 
instructions. Navarth grinned ear 
to ear. 

Gersen went back to the sa- 
loon, seated 'himself near Tanzel. 
He looked through into the pilot’s 
compartment, nodded to Na- 
varth. 

Navarth tapped Viole Falushe’s 
call-code. Gersen bent forward. 
At the lobe of Tanzel’s ear sound- 
ed a faint whir, an almost 
imperceptible vibration. Tanzel 
jerked, strained at his bonds. 

Navarth spoke softly into 
the forward microihone. “Viole 
Falushe. Can you hear me? Viole 
Falushe!” 



GALAXY 




fT'anzd jerked around, to meet 
’ Gersen’s appraising stare. 
There could be no more dis- 
sembling; Viole Falushe wa§ un- 
masked. A look of desperation 
came over his face; he writhed 
against his bonds. 

**Viole Falushe,” said Gersen. 
‘‘The time has come.” 

“!Who are you?” gasped Viole 
Faludhe. “IPCC?” 

Gersen made no answer Na- 
varth came back. 

“So this is he. I knew it dl 
<&e time. He inflicted me with 
ohilL Where is Jheral Tinzy, 
Vogel?” 

Viole Falushe licked his lips. 
“You two have plotted to kill 
me.” 

Gersen and Navarth carried 
him forward, into the pilot’s com- 
partment, closed the door com- 
municating with the saloon. 

‘Why?” cried Viole Falushe. 
“Why must you do this to me?” 

Navarth turned to Gersen. “Do 
you need me?” 

“No.” 

“Good-by, Vogel,” said Na- 
varth. “You have lived a remark- 
able life.” He went back into the 
saloon. 

■Gersen slowed the air-car to 
a hover. He opened the port. Ten 
thousand feet below spread the 
ocean. 

*‘Why? Why? Why?’^ cried 
Viole F^ushe. “Why do you do 
this to me?” 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



Gersen spoke in a dry voice, 
“You are a monomaniac. 1 am 
the same. When 1 wan a child 
the five Demon Princes brought 
their ships to Mount Pleasant. 
Do you recall?” 

“Long ago, so long ago I” 
“They destroyed', they killed, 
they enslaved. Everything I 
loved — family, friends, all des- 
troyed. The Demon Princes are 
my obsession. I have killed two 
of them. You will be the third. I 
am not Henry Lucas the journa- 
list I am Earth Gersen, and all 
my life is aimed toward — this.” 
He stuped toward "N^ole 
Falushe, Who made a terrible 
wrendhmg exertion. His bonds 
snapped; he lurched, flung out 
his arms and toppled backhand 
out the port Gersen watched the 
long figure drifting down toward 
the ocean until it passed from 
sight. Then he closed the port, re- 
turned to the saloon. Navarth had 
already released Mario and Ethu- 
en. 

“My aiK>logies to you,” said 
Gersen. “I hope you have not 
been seriously injured.” 

Ethuen gave him a look of un- 
speakable dislike; Mario made a 
muttering sound in bi$ throat. 

‘Well, then,” said Navarth 
cheerfully. “What now?” 

‘We will pick up our friends,” 
said Gersen. “No doubt they are 
wondering what is to become of 
them.” 



185 




“Then what?” growled Ethu- 
en. “How ai.- we to find our way 
back to Sogdian? We have no 
spiaceship.” 

Gersen laughed. “Were you de- 
ceived? This is Sogdian. That is 
the sun Miel. How could you not 
notice?” 

“Why should I? A lunatic pilot 
careened through the cluster for 
hours.” 

“A subterfuge. Zog was no 
lunatic. But he was careless; he 
performed no acclimatization rou- 
tine; when he flung open the i>ort 
there was no difference in pres- 
sure or composition. The light 
was the same intensity; the gravi- 
ty was the same, the sky was the 
same color, the clouds the same 
^ape, the flora of the same type.” 

“I noticed nothing,” said Na- 
varth. “But I am no space-travel- 
er. I feel no shame. K I ever re- 
turn to Earth, I shall never de- 
part again.” 

‘Tirst: a stop at the city 
Kouhila. The folk will be pleased 
to learn that they need pay no 
further taxes.”

\ t Atar Gersen found the Distis 
Pharaon as he had left it. 
Mario, Wible and daNossa had 
spaceboats of their own; the oth- 
er guests were conveyed back to 
the Oikumene by the ship which 
Vide Falushe had ordered for 

186 



their use. Navarth and the three 
Drusillas came aboard the Phara- 
on. Gersen flew them to New 
Wexford and put them aboard 
the packet for Earth. “I will send 
you money,” he told Navarth. 
“It will be for the girls. You 
must make sure that they are 
raised properly.” 

“I have done my best with Zan 
Zu,” said Navarth gruffly. “She 
is raised. What is amiss with 
her? The others will need^more 
care.” 

‘^Exactly. And when I am next 
on Earth I will see you.” 

“Good. We win sit on the deck 
of my houseboat and drink my 
fine wine.” Navarth turned away. 
Gersen took a deep breath, went 
to say good-by to Drudlla Way- 
les. 

She came close to him, took 
his hands. “Why can’t I come 
with you? Wherever you go.” 

“I can’t explain to you. But — 
no. Not now. I tried it once, to 
no avail.” 

“I would be different.” 

“I know you are. But there 
mi^t be worse problems. I mi^t 
not be able to part with you 
ever again.” 

“Will I ever see you again?” 
“I don’t think so.” 

Drusilla turned away. “Good- 
by,” she said listessly. 

Gersen took a step after her, 
halted, then swung around and 
went his way. 



GALAXY 




ersen chartered a freight car- 
rier and took it to> the Palace 
of Love. The gardens seemed 
wild, less well tended. An inde- 
finable gloom had come over the 
airy structures. 

Retz greeted him with cautious 
cordiality. “I have been doing 
your bidding. Slowly, easily, not 
to disturb or alarm.” 

He took Gersen on a tour of 
the special environments; he des- 
cribed the weird and intricate 
thought-patterns Viole Falushe 
had imposed upon his young vic- 
tims. One by one the victims were 
emerging into the upper air, some 
astonished, some delisted, some 
dazzle and fri^tened. 

Gersen could not leave Viole 
Falu^e’s books to moulder. He 
loaded them aboard the freighter 
and consigned them to the care 
of Jehan Addels at New Wexford. 
With a final admonition for Retz, 
Gersen himself departed aind 
flew off through the stars of 
Simeste Cluster, back toward the 
Oikumene. 

TVTonths later, sitting on the 
Esplanade at Avente, on 
Alphanor, Gersen saw a young 
woman approaching. She wore 
fashionable garments in the best 
of taste, she obviously had been 
raised in an atmosphere of gentili- 
ty and good manners. 

On a sudden impulse Gersen 
stepped forward. ‘‘Please excuse 

THE PALACE OF LOVE 



me,” he said, “but you resemble 
^meone I know on Earth. Are 
your parents Earth-folk?” 

The girl listened without em- 
barrassment. She shook her head. 
“This may seem strange, but I 
do not know my parents. I may, 
be an orphan, or — ” she made 
a rueful little grimace — ” some- 
thing else. My guardians receive 
money to provide a home for me. 
Do you know my parents?” 
Gersen thought, what in the 
world am I up to? Why disturb 
the girl with the detahs of her 
background, or worse, the night- 
mare she had no narrowly avoid- 
ed. For here, certainly, was Viole 
Falushe’s business on Alphanor. 

Gersen pretended doubt. “I’m 
mistaken — I think. The resem- 
blance must be a coincidence. 
You could not possibly be the 
person I thought you to be.” 

“I don’t believe you,” said 
Drusilla I. “You know but you 
won’t tell. I wonder why not?” 
Gersen grinned. The girl was 
immensely appealing, with a 
thousand charms and graces. “Sit 
here on the bench a moment. I’ll 
read you a ballad or two from 
the works of the mad poet Na- 
varth. When he wrote them he 
was perhaps thinking of you.” 
Drusilla I seated herself. “An 
unconventional way to start a 
acquaintance. But Fm an un- 
conventional person. Well, read 
the poetry.” — JACK VANCE

A loop, a bank, a vertical climb, 
and once again you know it’s time 
for the Annual Galaxy Bookshelf 
Awards. This institution, whose 
prestige has caught on like wild- 
fire throughout the science-fiction 
milieu, is still — as the First An- 
nual Galaxy Bookshelf Awards 
were last year — simply a state- 
ment that the following literary 
creations and creators have man- 
aged to impress me considerably. 
And the award still consists of one 
heartfdt oath of envy, collecti- 
ble at the earliest opportunity, 
and is I suppose convertible into 
drink, though I have days when 
the fortunate recipient may have 
to do the bu3dng. 

The best novel of the year was 



Daniel Keyes’s Flowers For Al- 
gernon, published by Harcourt, 
Brace & World. 

It was a bad year for short 
stories; I did not find a one in 
any sort of book publication that 
really sang. David I. Masson’s 
Travelers* Rest came closest. It 
appeared in Ace Books’ Second 
Annual World*s Best Science Fic- 
tion, and I will give it a grunt of 
appreciation, but reserve the oath. 

The most interesting “ne,w” 
writer is Roger Zelazny. There 
are stretches of time when I wish 
I were he. Or maybe that he were 
me. 

There is no award for a collec- 
tion or anthology, either. I think 
the growing availability of book 



188 




publication, and the increasing 
pressure to do books, and think 
in terms of books, is having a bad 
effect on the porter fiction, and 
newer writers, in this field. 

The best publishing idea of the 
year was World’s issuance of 
Sam Moskowitz’s book-end Seek- 
ers of Tomorrow and Modern 
Masterpieces of Science Fiction, 
Since giving Seekers of Tomor- 
row what I consider to have been 
a generally good review, I have 
heard from one of the writers bio- 
graphied-upon therein. His com- 
ments on Moskowitz’s sketch of 
his motivations as a writer, and 
of his motivations, period, were 
terse and moving. I feel duty- 
bound to report this to you. 
Nevertheless, it was a good idea. 

I n the past year, as you know, 
I’ve told you a couple of glar- 
ingly stupid things. One of them 
occurred in my review of John 
Bmnner’s The Squares of the 
City, in which I exactly reversed 
Blish’s Complaint. What Jim ac- 
tually said was that if you are 
going to write a story parallelling 
a chess game, you are obliged to 
create the game, too, rather than 
use an existing one as your model 
for the plot. I am not sure I 
agree, but in any event I butcher- 
ed this reference in discussing 
Brunner’s book. I have not, of 
course, changed my overall lack 
of impression in the slightest, des- 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



pite the fact that the New York 
Times chess writer gave it a good 
book review. 

I have the impression of a cou- 
ple of other stupidities, but I for- 
get them now. Let us in any 
event hurry on; if we do not, I 
will yield to the , temptation to 
begin awarding booby prizes to 
others besides myself. 

Fritz Leiber is one of science 
fiction’s lonely men. Living much 
of his writing life in such a hinter- 
land as Chicago, for God’s sake, 
and never quite falling in ex- 
clusively with some one maga- 
zine market or some one editor 
that might create an identifiable 
Fritz Leiber place in the micro- 
cosm, he goes his own way, and 
to all discernible intents always 
says what he thinks. 

What he thinks is often just a 
little to one side or another of 
whatever focus science fiction 
may be fixed on at the moment. 
The Night of the Wolf (Ballan- 
tine) is therefore an extremely 
interesting collection on purely 
forensic grounds. This fairly long 
book contains but four stories, a 
touch but not intrinsically moder- 
nized. Their copyright dates are 
1962, 1960, 1944 and 1950, and 
their original places of publication 
are as markedly different from 
each other as Galaxy, the old 
New York Amazing, the old As- 
tounding, and the Chicago pulp 

189 




'Amazing, Yet from these four 
stories he has been able to build 
a consistent declaration about the 
nature of man and society. Fur- 
thermore, what he has to say is 
quite cogent and certainly will be 
popular among the increasing 
number of readers who are in- 
creasingly concerned about the 
immediate future of Man. It may 
be possible to maintain that sci- 
ence fiction is finally arriving at 
the place that Leiber made for 
himself long ago. 

I don’t want you to think that 
these are all necessarily good 
otories considered as stories, 
though Leiber is a very good 
writer. Aside from having all the 
prose tools, he has, as you know, 
a gift for poetry, for the crea- 
tion of images which endure — 
In one case, in my own mind, 
over the twenty-two years since I 
first encountered the bridges to 
aowhere in Sanity, which in this 
book is republished as Crazy 
Wolf. In fact, his gift for captur- 
ng the perversity and the irony 
f the human situation, and what 
people do with it, is all by itself 
;ne good reason why it is hard 
stop reading a Leiber story. 

Nevertheless, there are times 
when only faith that the next 
nugget will soon arrive keeps you 
reading, because another thing 
Leiber discovered at some point 
was that he was not being paid 
enough by the word.

The Lone Wolf (originally 
The Creature from Cleveland 
Depths in Galaxy) is the lead 
story in this collection and 
boimces along quite nicely. 
Through the medium of Guster- 
son, the hugely alive, idea-spout- 
ing renegade who stays on the 
surface when the rest of humanity 
moles down into blast-proof 
cities, Leiber does a nice job of 
contrasting individualistic sanity 
with the self -destructive, social- 
ly safe inward spiral the world 
may be said to be on at the mo- 
ment. 

But this is followed by The 
Wolf Pair, (originally The Night 
of the Long Knives), which is 
surely much too long and ter- 
ribly uneventful. Between an en- 
gaging beginning as a man and 
woman stalk each other in radio- 
active wastelands, and a couple 
of intermediate minutes of con- 
tact with the beleaguered but 
brilliant civilization of Atlantic 
Highlands, it glaciates on through 
word after accountable word of 
conversation about the unfor- 
tunate nature of man. It isn’t 
that Leiber is saying something 
wrong, or that what he is saying 
is dull. It is how he says it that 
drags and drags, and this may put 
you off some since it is the long- 
est story in the book. 

But then you encounter Crazy 
Wolf, and in this short, essential- 
ly slight story whose burden is 

GALAXY 




that in a society of gentle luna- 
tics it’s the aggressive sane man 
who’s coo- coo, there is writing 
which, as I’ve testified, one does 
not want to forget. 

The final story is The Wolf 
Pack, which ran as Let Free- 
dom Ring during one of the 
many periods in Amazing*s life 
when it was sliding quickly 
downhill and was about to be 
completely revamped. 

This is the story of a society 
in which humanity has at last 
learned not to fight. What it has 
learned to do instead is regiment 
its members so thoroughly that 
they will accept a “moral equi- 
valent of war” — the manufac- 
ture, stockpiling and ritual des- 
truction of all the material neces- 
sary to support a major war, and 
the concurrent ritual death of 
five per cent of the population 
chosen by lot. The story is told 
mostly about Normsi, a young 
man who is one of the lucky five 
per cent and who refuses to swal- 
low the propaganda which will 
make him proud of his honored 
duties to society. 

This collection does hold to- 
gether, does make a point and is 
the work of a consistent and 
talented thinker, of a profes- 
sional. And of a thought-out 
world-view which clearly must 
exist in the writer’s mind for 
something other than story pur- 
poses. I guess the thing to say 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



about The Night of the Wolf, 
and its effectiveness as an attempt 
to make four widely separated 
stories tell a story of human pro- 
gress, is that it is an intelligent 
book. They are scarce. 

I’d never heard of John Ly- 
mington before, and the Double- 
day ($3.95) edition of Froowb! 
tells me nothing about him, be- 
yond the fact that he is the au- 
thor of at least five previous 
books, and that this book was 
originally copyright 1964. 1 would 
assume the copyright was regis- 
tered in England, for Lymington 
is clearly an English author in 
the great tradition of science- 
thriller writing. 

The plot idea behind Froomh! 
(I’ll explain the title in a min- 
ute) is that Heaven occurs in the 
future. Lymington has apparent- 
ly read Experiment With Time, 
and from it has his characters 
assert that in science’s best guess, 
time moves in belts of various 
speeds ; not only that people have 
died and been brought back to 
life but that in these cases they 
have always been dead for a per- 
iod of exactly twenty-four hours; 
that Heaven or the afterlife or 
something does exist and that it 
is attainable by either time-travel 
or matter transmission. 

These calm, matter-of-fact 
statements are well within the 
rules of English thriller writing, 

191 




in which the author is allowed 
to take wild liberties with the 
truth on which he bases the re- 
mainder of his story. But it is 
very rare that a writer, once hav- 
ing placed this identification on 
his work, then goes on to write 
something else entirely, namely 
a book at which ‘‘science” plays 
the role assigned to industrial 
technology in Rachel Carson’s 
Silent Springs 

“Froomb” is an acronym based, 
the author says, on a famous car- 
toon published first in The De- 
troit Messenger, and later in all 
countries, depicting the world at 
the wheel of a motor car, rushing 
at great speed down a slope to 
the final abyss, crying, “The 
Fluid’s Running Out Of My 
Brakes 1” 

I don’t believe in that cartoon. 
It certainly doesn’t sound like 
something that would sweep the 
world and give rise to a popular 
catchphrase. Furthermore, brakes 
don’t have fluid in them. Most 
kinds of automobile brakes are 
fluid pressure-actuated, true. 
They could just as easily be 
mechanical, compressed air or 
electromagnetic-operated without 
being changed in their essential 
nature, which as a matter of fact 
had better be as dry as possible. I 
bring up this little mechanical 
digression the sake of a pair of 
hypotheses, take your pick. (One) 
Perhaps the world is confused, 

192 



and the author knows it. (Two) 
Perhaps a half-educated part of 
the world is confused, and the au- 
thor, being a member of that 
set, is also confused. 

I vote for Proposition Two. 
Lymington’s intellectual thesis — 
no, Lymington’s assumption — 
is that “science” in managing 
the world of the immediate fu- 
ture will run increasingly into 
side effects, and as a subheading 
under this is the assumption that 
side effects are always catastro- 
phic. In Lymington’s view of his 
scientist hero, David Packard, 
who is Britain’s Minister for Sci- 
ence, there is no difference be- 
tween the chemism that concerns 
itself with insect sprays and the 
science that concerns itself with 
nuclear physics. (Lymington 
thinks cobalt is a nuclear ex- 
plosive). 

Now, this is a farrago, a pack 
of misassumptions and disunder- 
standings. If A. E. Van Vogt had 
written it, it would be simple to 
say, “My God, he’s read another 
book!” But Lymington is an Eng- 
lishman, and there’s some majes- 
tic and enviable rule in England 
that says you don’t become a 
commercial writer until you have 
learned how to handle prose. 
Even the shabbiest and most 
cliche-ridden story the English 
can produce is nevertheless writ- 
ten at a higher level of composi- 
tion that you would expect to find 

GALAXY 




in the equivalent story written 
here. (I generalize sweepingly, 
but I feel that I generalize ac- 
curately). Accordingly, this is an 
often exciting, interesting, literate 
book, full of nicely evoked scene- 
setting, believable dialogue (once 
you accept the fact that none of 
these people know what they’re 
talking about), and a level of 
sophistication about social inter- 
actions that is simply not avail- 
able in most routine books writ- 
ten in this country. 

By American standards, it has 
the trappings of thoughtfulness 
and genuine meaning. That wor- 
ries me. 

Poul Anderson’s The Trouble 
Twisters (Doubleday, $3.95) is a 
collection of three stories about 
David Falkayn, rising young 
man in the Polesotedinic 
League. The League, you will re- 
member, is the social device used 
with such success by Nicholas 
van Rijn, and David is in fact an 
employee of van Rijn Solar 
Spice & Liquors Co. In this book, 
lovable Nick has retreated to the 
status of legend — he gets brief 
mention as David Falkayn hopes 
some particularly brilliant ex- 
ploit will bring the young man’s 
name to the grand old man’s at- 
tention. 

But what we have here is the 
van Rijn xmiverse, and the van 
Rijn philosophy all over again. 

GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



There are many races in the 
galaxy, with many of which Man 
may hold converse provided he 
can establish meaningful com- 
piunication before somebody gets 
critically mad at him. Interstellar 
travel is cheap enough to make 
import-export a lucrative trade, 
and therefore there are also many 
opportunities for a merchant-ad- 
venturer to make commercial ar- 
rangements with alien races, pro- 
vided he can establish enough 
common cultural ground before 
being knocked off for an interfer- 
ing foreign devil. 

If you will remember, glorious, 
garrulous, bibulous Nick van 
Rijn was always being haunted by 
some upright young man or the 
other who wanted to do the ideal- 
istic thing while Nick tried to 
chase a dollar. David Falkayn is 
that young man, except that he 
has gotten the message clear, and 
his idealism is based on a roman- 
tic notion about merchandising 
and the beneficial effects of buy- 
ing cheap and selling dear. 

This view of things took good 
hold on a reader when expressed 
by van Rijn because he was such 
an obvious pirate and such a blat- 
ant hypocrite that you naturally 
couldn’t help liking him and ap- 
proving of anything he did. Be- 
sides, you were safe in your chair 
reading a book, so the chances of 
your getting in his way profession- 
ally were small. Falkayn, on an- 

193 




other hand, is a likeable young 
fellow, insecure about his place 
in the world, not too sure he’s 
going to measure up to his ideal, 
yet brave and mentally quick. In 
the first story. The Thiee-Corner- 
ed Wheel, he is an apprentice, 
trapped away from his crippled 
ship on a planet where repair 
parts are available but cannot be 
transported to the vessel because 
the local religion forbids the vul- 
gar use of circles in any artifact. 
The wheel, as you know, is a 
representation of a circle, and so 
David has the problem of finding 
some sort of wheel which is not 
a circle, to build a wagon. 

Anderson is known to be a 
gifted writer of adventure fiction. 
The detail, the plotting, the pace 
and the characterizations in this 
story are all at least adequate, 
often far better than average, 
sometimes superb. The spaceship 
crew’s attempt to grapple with 
the problems of the church, state, 
and intellectual establishment of 
the alien world are suspensefully 
told. But the story is called The 
Three-Cornered Wheel and after 
the first thousand words the over- 
riding thought is: **Now is he go- 
ing to think of it? iVow is he?” 
This does distract in some mea- 
sure from the reader’s enjoyment. 

The middle story is A Sim In- 
visible, in which the problem is 
the emergence of a hostile, space- 
faring civilization of aliens, liber- 

194 



ally sprinkled with unaccounta- 
ble-for humans, who come from 
a solar system and a sun which 
cannot possibly exist, and busily 
set about kicking the Polesotech- 
nic League out of an entire sec- 
tor of the sky. Finally we have 
The Trouble Twisters, orginally 
published as Trade Team, in 
which Falkayn more or less com- 
mands a spaceship whose alien 
crew consists of an intelligent cat, 
an intelligent dinosaur and an in- 
telligent computer. Once again 
he has a problem, once again he 
solves it, though he has to lean 
on the computer to some extent. 
As a demonstration that compu- 
ters have personality too, the ma- 
chine asks for a share of profits 
and beats everybody at poker. 

Sometimes I think that Ander- 
son thinks he missed his chance; 
that somewhere, somehow, good 
as he is and rewarding as he is, he 
personally did not get from sci- 
ence fiction all that he deserves, 
and that he has shrugged his 
shoulders. Certainly, I think he 
has to some extent been damned 
with the wrong kind of praise, 
and stood in the wrong shadows. 
But even in froth, he is so damn 
good ‘ — though not always in 
what calls attention to itself on 
paper — that we miss noticing 
what really bad things would 
have happened to these stories 
in the hands of. lesser men.
