business, surely, but what an adver- 
tisement of poor taste! Anthony, on 
the other hand, had decided on 
Smith when he had turned thirteen 
and had never changed it. It was 
simple, easily spelled — and quite 
distinctive, since he had never met 
anyone else who had chosen that 
name. It was once very common — 
among the pre-Cats, which explain- 
ed its rareness now, perhaps. 

But the difference in names 
meant nothing when the two were 
together. They looked alike. 

They weren’t twins — but then 
only one of a pair of twin-fertilized 
ova was allowed to come to term. It 
was just that physical similarity oc- 
casionally appeared in the non-twin 
situation — especially when the rela- 
tionship was on both sides. An- 
thony was five years younger than 
his brother, but both had the beaky 
nose, the heavy eyelids, the just 
noticeable cleft in the chin. It was 
just asking for it when, out of some 
passion for monotony, parents re- 
peated. 

At first, now that they were to- 
gether, their appearance drew that 
startled glance followed by the ela- 
borate silence. Anthony tried to 
ignore the matter, but out of sheer 
perversity — or perversion — William 
was as likely as not to say, “We’re 
brothers.’’ 

“Oh?’’ the other would say, 
hanging in there for just a moment 
as though he wanted to ask if they 
were full blood-brothers. But then 
good manners would win the day 



and the fellow would turn away as 
though it were a matter of no in- 
terest. That happened only rarely, 
of course. Most of the people in 
the Project knew — how could it be 
prevented? — and avoided the situa- 
tion. 

Not that William was a bad 
fellow. Not at all. If they hadn’t 
been brothers (or if they had been 
but had had sufficiently different 
looks to be able to mask the fact) 
they might have gotten along 
famously. 

As it was . 

It didn’t make it easier that they 
had played together as youngsters, 
and had shared the earlier stages of 
their education in the same creche 
through some successful maneuver- 
ing on the part of their mother. 
Having borne two sons by the same 
father and having, in this fashion, 
reached her limit (she had not 
fulfilled the requirement for a 
third) she conceived the notion of 
being able to visit both with a single 
trip. She was a strange woman. 

Being the elder, William had left 
the creche first. He had gone into 
science — genetic engineering. An- 
thony had learned of that, while he 
was still in the creche, through a 
letter from his mother. When he 
was old enough to speak firmly to 
the matron those letters stopped. 
But he always remembered the last 
one for the agony of shame it had 
brought him. 

Having the talent, Anthony had 
eventually entered a science, too.

IF 




He remembered having had the 
wild— and prophetic, he now rea- 
lized — fear he might meet his 
brother, and so had chosen tele- 
metries, which was about as far re- 
moved from genetic engineering as 
one could imagine. 

Or so one would have thought. 
Through all the elaborate develop- 
ment of the Mercury Project, cir- 
cumstance waited. 

The time came, as it happened, 
when the Mercury Project appeared 
to be facing a dead end. But a sug- 
gestion had been made which saved 
the situation — and at the same time 
dragged Anthony into the dilemma 
his parents had prepared for him. 
The best and most sardonic part of 
the whole thing was that it was 
Anthony who, in his innocence, 
made the suggestion. 

II 

W ILLIAM Anti-Aut, Anthony’s 
uninhibited elder brother, 
knew of the Mercury Project, but 
only in the way he knew of the long- 
drawn-out Stellar Probe that had 
been on its way before he was bom 
and would still be on its way after 
his death; the way he knew of the 
Martian colony and of the continu- 
ing attempts to establish similar 
colonies on the asteroids. Such 
things were on the distant periphery 
of his mind and of no real impor- 
tance. No part of the space effort 
had ever swirled inward closer to 
the center of his interests, as far as 



he could remember — till the day 
when the printout included photo- 
graphs of some of the men engaged 
in the Mercury Project. 

William’s attention was caught 
first by the fact that one of them 
had been identified as Anthony 
Smith. He remembered the odd last 
name his brother had chosen, and 
he remembered the “Anthony”. 
Surely there could not be two 
Anthony Smiths. 

He had then looked at the photo- 
graph itself — no mistaking the face. 
He looked in the mirror. No mis- 
taking the face. 

He felt amused, but uneasily so; 
he recognized the potential embar- 
rassment for all parties. Full blood- 
brothers, to use the disgusting 
phrase. But what was there to do 
about it? How correct the fact that 
both his father and his mother had 
been utterly without imagination? 

He must have absently put the 
print-out in his pocket when he was 
getting ready to leave for work, for 
he came across it during his lunch- 
hour. He stared at it again. An- 
thony looked keen. It was quite a 
good reproduction— the printouts 
were of enormously good quality 
these days. 

His lunch partner, Marco What- 
everrhis-name-was-that-week said 
curiously, “What are you looking 
at, William?” 

On impulse, William passed him 
the printout and said, “That’s my 
brother.” Grasping the nettle. 

Marco studied it, frowning. 



STRANGER IN PARADISE

“Who? The man standing next to 
you?” 

“No, me — I mean the man who 
looks like me. He’s my brother.” 

There was a longer pause this 
time. Marco handed it back and 
said with a careful levelness to his 
voice, “Same-parents brother?” 

“Yes.” 

“Father and mother both?” 

“Yes.” 

“Ridiculous!” 

“I suppose so.” William sighed. 
“Well, according to this, he’s do- 
ing telemetries over in Texas and 
I’m doing work in autistics up 
here. So what difference does it 
make?” 

William did not keep it in his 
mind and later that day he threw 
the printout away. He did not want 
his current bedmate to come across 
it. She had a ribald sense of humor 
that William was finding increas- 
ingly wearying. He was rather glad 
she was not interested in having a 
child by him. He had had one a few 
years back anyway. That little bru- 
nette, Laura or Linda, one or the 
other name, had collaborated. 

I T WAS quite a time after that, at 
least a year, that the matter of 
Randall had come up. 

If William had given no further 
thought to his brother — and he 
hadn’t — before that, he certainly 
had no time for it afterward. 

Randall was sixteen when Wil- 
liam first received word of him. He 
had lived an increasingly seclusive 



life and the Kentucky creche in 
which he was being brought up de- 
cided to cancel him — and of course 
it was only some eight or ten days 
before cancellation that it occurred 
to anyone to report him to the New 
York Institute for the Science of 
Man. (I’he Homological Institute 
was its common name.) 

William received the report along 
with several others, and there was 
nothing in the description of Ran- 
dall that particularly attracted his 
notice. Still it was time for one of 
his tedious trips to the creches and 
there was one likely possibility in 
West Virginia. He went there — and 
was disappointed into promising 
himself (for the fiftieth time) that 
he would thereafter make such 
visits by TV image. But then, hav- 
ing dragged himself to the general 
area, thought he might as well take 
a look at the Kentucky creche be- 
fore returning home. 

He expected nothing. 

Yet he hadn’t studied Randall’s 
gene pattern for more than ten 
minutes before he was calling the 
Institute for a computer calcula- 
tion. Then he sat back and per- 
spired slightly at the thought that 
only a last-minute impulse had 
brought him, that without that im- 
pulse Randall would have been 
quietly cancelled. A drug would 
have soaked painlessly through his 
skin, into his bloodstream and he 
would have sunk into a peaceful 
sleep that gradually deepened into 
death. The drug had a twenty-three

IF 




syllable official name, but William 
called it “nirvanamine” — as did 
everyone else. 

William said, “What is his full- 
name, matron?” 

The creche-matron said, “Ran- 
dall Nowan, scholar.” 

“No one!” said William, explo- 
sively. 

“Nowan.” The matron spelled it. 
“He chose it last year.” 

“And it meant nothing to you? It « 
is pronounced No one! It didn’t oc- 
cur to you to report this young man 
last year?” 

“It didn’t seem — ” began the 
matron, flustered. 

William waved her to silence. 
What was the use? How was she to 
know? There was nothing in the 
§eno-pattern to have given her 
warning. The usual textbook cri- 
teria was useless here. It was a 
subtle combination that William 
and his staff had worked out over a 
period of twenty years through ex- 
periments on autistic children — and 
a combination they had never ac- 
tually seen in the flesh. 

So close to cancelling! 

Marco, the hard-head of the 
group, complained that the creches 
were too eager both to abort and to. 
cancel. He maintained that all 
gene-patterns should be allowed to 
develop until initial screening, that 
there should be no cancellation 
without consultation with a homol- 
ogist. 

“There aren’t enough homolo- 
gists,” William had told him. 



“Well, we can at least run all 
gene patterns through the com- 
puter,” said Marco. 

“To save anything we can get for 
our own use?” 

“For any homological use, here 
or elsewhere. We must study gene- 
patterns in action if we’re to under- 
stand ourselves properly— and it is 
the abnormal and monstrous pat- 
terns that give us most information. 
Our experiments on autism have 
taught us more about homology 
than the sum total of existing 
knowledge on the day we began.” 

William, who still preferred the 
roll of the phrase ‘the genetic 
physiology of man’ to ‘homology’, 
shook his head. “Just the same, 
we’ve got to play it carefully. How- 
ever useful we can claim our experi- 
ments to be, we exist on bare social 
permission, reluctantly given. We 
are playing with lives.” 

“Useless lives. Fit only for can- 
celling.” 

“A quick and pleasant cancelling 
is one thing. Our experiments, 
usually drawn-out and sometimes 
extremely unpleasant, are an- 
other.” 

“We help them sometimes,” re- 
plied Marco. 

“And we don’t help them some- 
times.” 

' It was a pointless argument, 
really, for there was no way of 
settling it. What it came down to 
was that there were too few interest- 
ing abnormalities and no way of 
urging mankind to encourage a

greater production. The trauma of 
the Catastrophe would never vanish 
in a dozen ways, including that 
one. 

The hectic push toward space ex- 
ploration could be traced back (and 
was, by some sociologists) to the 
knowledge of the fragility of the 
life-skein on the planet, thanks to 
the Catastrophe. 

Well, never mind — that’s an- 
other story. 

There had never been anyone 
like Randall Nowan, not for Wil- 
liam. The slow onset of autism 
characteristic only of that totally 
rare gene pattern meant that more 
was known about Randall than 
about any autistic patient before 
him. They even caught some last 
faint glimmers of his thought-pro- 
cesses in the laboratory — before he 
closed off altogether and finally 
shrank completely within the wall 
of his skin, unconcerned, unreach- 
able. 

Then they began the slow process 
whereby Randall, subjected for in- 
creasing lengths of time to artificial 
stimuli, yielded up the inner work- 
ings of his brain and gave clues 
thereby to the inner workings of all 
brains, those called normal as well 
as those similar to his own. 

So vastly great was the data they 
were gathering that William began 
to feel his dream of reversing 
autism might be more than merely 
a dream. He felt a warm gladness 
at having chosen the name Anti- 
Aut. 



He was almost at the height of 
the euphoria induced by the work 
on Randall when he received the 
call from Dallas, and the heavy 
pressure began — now, of all 
times — to abandon his work and 
take on a new problem. 

Looking back on it later, he 
could never work out just what it 
was that finally led him to agree to 
visit Dallas. In the end, of course, 
he could see how fortunate it was — 
but what had persuaded him? 
Could he, even at the start, have 
had a dim, unrealized notion of the 
potential outcome? Surely, impos- 
sible. 

Was it the unrealized memory of 
that printout-photograph of his 
brother? Surely, impossible. 

But he let himself be argued into 
visiting the Project, and it was only 
when the micro-pile power unit 
changed the pitch of its soft hum 
and the agrav unit took over for the 
final descent that he remembered 
that photograph — at least con- 
sciously. 

Anthony worked at Dallas and, 
William remembered now, at the 
Mercury Project. That was what 
the caption had referred to. He 
swallowed, as the soft jar told him 
the journey was over. This would be 
uncomfortable. 



Ill 

Anthony was waiting on the roof 
jHL reception-area to greet the in-

IF 




coming expert. Not by himself, of 
course. He was part of a sizable 
delegation — the size itself was a 
grim indication of the desperation 
to which they had been reduced. 
Furthermore he was among the 
lower echelons; that he was there at 
all was only because it was he who 
had made the original suggestion. 

He felt a slight but continuing 
uneasiness at the thought of that. 
He had put himself on the line. He 
had received considerable approval 
for it, but there had been the faint 
insistence always that it was his 
suggestion; if it turned out to be a 
fiasco, every one of them would 
move out of the line of fire, leaving 
him alone at point-zero. 

There were occasions, later, when 
he brooded over the possibility that 
the dim memory of a brother in 
homology had suggested his 
thought. That might have been, 
but it didn’t have to be. The sug- 
gestion was so sensible, so inevi- 
table, that surely he would have 
had the same thought if his brother 
had been something as innocuous 
as a fantasy writer — or if he had 
had no brother at all, for that 
matter. 

The problem was the inner 
planets — 

The Moon and Mars were colo- 
nized. The larger asteroids and the 
satellites of Jupiter had been 
reached, and plans were in progress 
for a manned voyage to Titan, Sa- 
turn’s large satellite. Yet even with 
plans underway for sending men to 



the outer Solar system there was 
still no chance of a manned ap- 
proach to the inner planets, for fear 
of the Sun. 

Venus was the less attractive of 
the two worlds within Earth’s orbit. 
Mercury, on the other hand . 

Anthony had not yet joined the 
team when Dmitri Large (he was 
quite short, actually) had given the 
talk that had moved the World 
Congress sufficiently to vote the ap- 
propriation that made the Mercury 
Project possible. 

Anthony had listened to the 
tapes, and had heard Dmitri’s pre- 
sentation. Tradition was firm to the 
effect that it had been extempo- 
raneous, and perhaps it was, but it 
had been perfectly constructed and 
held within it, in essence, every 
guideline followed by the Mercury 
Project since. 

The chief point was that it would 
be wrong to hold inner-planet re- 
search in abeyance until technology 
had advanced to the point where a 
manned expedition through the 
rigors of Solar radiation would be- 
come feasible. Mercury was a 
unique .environment that could 
teach much, and from Mercury’s 
surface sustained observations 
could be made of the Sun that 
could not be made in any other 
way. 

Provided a suitable man-substi- 
tute — a robot, in short — could be 
placed on the planet. 

A robot with the required physi- 
cal characteristics could be built. 



STRANGER IN PARADISE 



11 




Soft-landings were as easy as kiss- 
my-hand. Yet once a robot landed, 
what next? 

He could make his observations 
and guide his actions on the basis 
of those observations, but the Pro- 
ject wanted his actions to be intri- 
cate and subtle, at least potentially, 
and they were not at all sure what 
observations he might make. 

To prepare for all reasonable 
possibilities and to allow for all the 
intricacy desired, the robot would 
need to contain a computer suffi- 
ciently complex and versatile to fall 
into the same asteroid with a mam- 
malian brain. 

Yet nothing like that could be 
miniaturized sufficiently to be used 
in the kind of robot they planned. 
Perhaps someday the positronic- 
path devices that the roboticists 
were playing with might make it 
possible, but that someday was not 
yet. 

The alternative was to have the 
robot send back to Earth every ob- 
servation it made as it was made. A 
computer on Earth could then 
guide its every action on the basis of 
those observations. The robot’s 
body, in short, was to be there, its 
brain here. 

Once that decision was reached 
telemetrists became the key techni- 
cians. It was then that Anthony 
joined the Project as one of those 
who labored to devise methods for 
receiving and returning impulses 
over distances of from 50 to 140 
million miles, toward, and some- 



times past, a Solar disk that could 
interfere with those impulses in a 
most ferocious manner. 

He took to his job with passion 
and (he firmly thought) with skill 
and success. It was he, more than 
anyone else, who had designed the 
three switching-stations that had 
been hurled into permanent orbit 
about Mercury. Each of them had 
the job of sending and receiving im- 
pulses from Mercury to Earth and 
from Earth to Mercury. Each was 
capable of resisting, more or less 
permanently, the radiation from 
the Sun, and more than that, each 
could filter out Solar interference. 

Three equivalent Orbiters were 
placed at a distence of a little over a 
million miles from Earth, reaching 
north and south of the plane of the 
Ecliptic so that they could receive 
the impulses from Mercury and re- 
lay them to Earth — or vice versa — 
even when Mercury was behind the 
Sun and inaccessible to direct re- 
ception from any station on Earth’s 
surface. 

Which left the robot itself; a 
marvelous specimen of both the 
roboticists’ and telemetrists’ arts. 
The most complex of ten successive 
models, it was capable, with only a 
little over twice the volume and five 
times the mass of a man, of sensing 
and doing considerably more than 
a man — if it could be guided. 

How complex a computer had to 
be to guide the robot made itself 
rapidly evident, however, as each 
response-step had to be modified to 



12 



IF 




allow for possible variations in per- 
ception. And as each response-step 
itself enforced the certainty of 
greater complexity of possible vari- 
ation in perceptions, the early steps 
had to be reinforced and made 
stronger. It built itself up endlessly, 
like a chess game, and the teleme- 
trists began to use a computer to 
program the computer that design- 
ed the program for the computer 
that programed the robot-control- 
ling computer. 

There was nothing but confusion. 

The robot was at a base in the 
Arizona desert and was working 
well. The computer in Dallas could 
not, however, handle him well 
enough; not even under perfectly 
known Earth conditions. How 
then — 

Anthony remembered the day 
when he had made the suggestion. 
It was on 7-4-553. He remembered 
it, for one thing, because he re- 
membered thinking that day that 
7-4 had been an important holiday 
in the Dallas-region of the world 
among the pre-Cats half a millen- 
nium before — 553 years before, to 
be exact. 



I T HAD been at dinner. (And a 
good dinner, too. There had 
been a careful adjustment of the 
ecology of the region and the Pro- 
ject personnel had high priority in 
collecting the food supplies that be- 
came available — so there’ was an 
unusual degree of choice on the 



menus, and Anthony had tried 
roast duck.) 

The roast duck had made him 
somewhat more expansive than 
usual. Everyone was in a rather 
self-expressive mood, in fact, and 
Ricardo said, “We’ll never do it. 
Let’s admit it. We’ll never do it.’’ 

There was no telling how many 
had thought such a thing how many 
times before, but it was a rule that 
no one said so openly. Open pessi- 
mism might be the final push 
needed for appropriations to stop 
(they had been coming with greater 
difficulty each year for five years 
now) and if there were a. chance, it 
would be gone. 

Anthony, ordinarily not given to 
extraordinary optimism, but now 
revelling over his duck, said, “Why 
can’t we do it? Tell me why, and I’ll 
refute it.’’ 

Ricardo’s dark eyes narrowed at 
once to the challenge. “You want 
me to tell you why?’’ 

“I sure do.’’ 

Ricardo swung his chair around, 
facing Anthony full. He said, 
“There’s no mystery. Dmitri Large 
won’t say so openly in any report 
but you know and I know that to 
run Mercury Project properly, we’ll 
need a computer as complex as a 
human brain whether it’s on Mer- 
cury or here, and we can’t build 
one. So where does that leave us ex- 
cept to play games with the World 
Congress and get money for make- 
work and possible useful spinoffs?’’ 

Anthony, a complacent smile on 



STRANGER IN PARADISE 



13 




his face, said, “That’s easy to 
refute. You’ve given us the answer 
yourself.” (Was he playing games? 
Was it the warm feeling of duck in 
his stomach? The desire to tease 
Ricardo? Or did some unfelt 
thought of his brother touch him? 
There was no way, later, that he 
could tell.) 

‘‘What answer?” Ricardo rose. 
He was quite tall and unusually 
thin and he always wore his white 
coat unseamed. He folded his arms 
and seemed to be doing his best to 
tower over the seated Anthony like 
an unfolded meter-rule. “What 
answer?” 

‘‘You say we need a computer as 
complex as a human brain. All 
right, then, we’ll build one.” 

‘‘The point, you idiot, is that we 
can’t — ” 

‘‘ We can’t. But there are others.” 

‘‘What others?” 

‘‘People who work on brains, of 
course. We’re just solid-state me- 
chanics. We have no idea in what 
way a human brain is complex, or 
where, or to what extent. Why 
don’t we get in a homologist and 
have him design a computer?” 
With that Anthony took a huge 
helping of stuffing, savored it com- 
placently. He could still remember, 
after all this time, the taste of the 
stuffing, though he couldn’t re- 
member in detail what had hap- 
pened afterward. 

It seemed to him that no one had 
taken it seriously. There was laugh- 
ter and a general feeling that 



Anthony had wriggled out of a hole 
by clever sophistry, so that the 
laughter was at Ricardo’s expense. 
(Afterward, of course, everyone 
claimed to have taken the sugges- 
tion seriously.) 

Ricardo blazed up, pointed a 
finger at Anthony and said, ‘‘Write 
that up. I dare you put that sug- 
gestion into writing.” (At least, so 
Anthony’s memory had it. Ricardo 
had, since then, stated his com- 
ment was an enthusiastic, ‘‘Good 
idea! Why don’t you write it up for- 
mally, Anthony?”) 

Anthony put it in writing. 

Dmitri Large had taken to it. In 
private conference, he had slapped 
Anthony on the back and had said 
that he had been speculating in 
that direction himself — though he 
did not offer to take any credit for it 
on the record. (Just in case it 
turned out to be a fiasco, Anthony 
thought.) 

Dmitri Large conducted the 
search for the appropriate homolo- 
gist. It did not occur to Anthony 
that he ought to be interested. He 
knew neither homology nor homol- 
ogists — except, of course, his 
brother, and he had not thought of 
him. Not consciously. 

So Anthony was up there waiting 
in the reception area, in a minor 
role, when the door of the aircraft 
opened and several men descended. 
In the course of the handshakes 
that began going around he found 
himself staring at his own face. 

His cheeks burned and, with all 



14 



IF 




his might, he wished himself a 
thousand miles away. 

IV 

M ore than ever William 
wished that the memory of 
his brother had come earlier. It 
should have — surely it should have. 

But there had been the flattery of 
the request and the excitement that 
had begun to grow in him. Per- 
haps, he had deliberately avoided 
remembering. 

To begin with there had been the 
exhilaration of Dmitri Large com- 
ing to see him — and in his own 
proper presence. He had come 
from 'Dallas to New York by plane 
and that had been, very titillating 
for William, wl^ose secret vice it 
was to read thrillers. In the thrillers 
men and women always traveled 
mass-wise when secrecy was de- 
sired. After all, electronic travel 
was public property — at least in the 
thrillers, where every beam of radi- 
ation that carried information was 
invariably bugged. 

William had said so in a kind of 
morbid half- attempt at humor, but 
Dmitri hadn’t seemed to be listen- 
ing. He was staring at William’s 
face and his thoughts seemed else- 
where. “I’m sorry,’’ he said, finally. 
“You remind me of someone.’’ 
(Even that hadn’t given it away 
to William. How was that pos- 
sible?) 

Dmitri Large was a small plump 
man who seemed to be in a per- 



petual twinkle even when he de- 
clared himself worried or annoyed. 
He had a round and bulbous nose, 
pronounced cheeks and softness 
everywhere. He emphasized his last 
name and said with a quickness 
that led William to suppose he said 
it often, “Size is not all the large 
there is, my friend.’’ 

In the talk that followed, William 
protested much. He knew nothing 
about computers. Nothing! He had 
not the faintest idea of how they 
worked or how they were pro- 
gramed. 

“No matter, no matter,’’ Dmitri 
said, shoving the point aside with 
an expressive gesture of the hand. 
“We know the computers; we can 
set up the programs. You just tell 
us what it is a computer must be 
made to do so that it will work like 
a brain and not like a computer.’’ 

“I’m not sure I know enough 
abotft how a brain works to be able 
to tell you that, Dmitri,” said 
William. 

“You are the foremost homolo- 
gist in the world,” said Dmitri. “I 
have checked that out carefully.” 
That disposed of that. 

William listened with gathering 
gloom. He supposed it was inevi- 
table. Dip a person into one par- 
ticular specialty deeply enough and 
long enough and he would auto- 
matically begin to assume that 
specialists in all other fields were 
magicians, judging the depth of 
their wisdom by the breadth of his 
own ignorance — and as time went 



STRANGER IN PARADISE 



15 




on, William learned a great deal- 
more of the Mercury Project than it 
seemed to him at the time that he 
would ever care to do. 

He said at last, “Why use a com- 
puter at all, then? Why not have 
one of your own men, or relays of 
them, receive the material from the 
robot and send back instructions."’ 

“Oh, oh, oh,” said Dmitri, al- 
most bouncing in his chair in his 
eagerness. “You see, you are not 
aware. Men are too slow to analyze 
quickly all the material the robot 
will send back — temperatures and 
gas pressures and cosmic ray fluxes 
and solar wind intensities and 
chemical compositions and soil tex- 
tures and easily three dozen more 
items — and then try to decide on 
the next step. A human being 
would merely guide the robot, and 
ineffectively; a computer would be 
the robot. 

“And then, too,’’ he went on, 
“men are too fast, also. It takes 
radiation of any kind anywhere 
from ten to twenty-two minutes to 
make the round trip between Mer- 
cury and Earth, depending on 
where each is in its orbit. Nothing 
can be done about that. You get an 
observation, you give an order, but 
much has happened between the 
time the observation is made and 
the response returns. Men can’t 
adapt to the slowness of the speed 
of light but a computer can take 
that into account. Come help us, 
William.’’ 

William said gloomily, “You are 



certainly welcome to consult me, 
for what good that might do you. 
My private TV beam is at your ser- 
vice.’’ 

“But it’s not consultation I want. 
You must come with me.’’ 
“Mass-wise?’’ said William, 
shocked. 

“Yes, of course. A project like 
this can’t be carried out by sitting 
at opposite ends of a laser beam 
with a communications satellite in 
the middle. In the long run, it is too 
expensive, too inconvenient, and, 
of course, it lacks all privacy.’’ 

It was like a thriller, William 
decided. 

“Come to Dallas,’’ said Dmitri, 
“and let me show you what we have 
there. Let me show you the facili- 
ties. Talk to some of our computer 
men. Give them the benefit of your 
way of thought.’’ 

It was time, William thought, to 
be decisive. “Dmitri,” he said. “I 
have work of my own here. Impor- 
tant work that I do not wish to 
leave. To do what you want me to 
do may take me away from my 
laboratory for months.” 

“Months!” said Dmitri, clearly 
taken aback. “My good William, it 
may well be years. But surely it will 
be your work.” 

“No, it will not. I know what my 
work is and guiding a robot on 
Mercury is not it.” 

“Why not? If you do it properly, 
you will learn more about the brain 
merely by trying to make a com- 
puter work like one, and you will 



16 



IF 




come back here, finally, better 
equipped to do what you now con- 
sider your work. And while you’re 
gone, will you have no associates to 
carry on? And can you not be in 
constant communication with them 
by laser beam and television? And 
can you not visit New York on oc- 
casion? Briefly.” 

William was moved. The thought 
of working on the brain from an- 
other direction did hit home. From 
that point bn he found himself 
looking for excuses to go — at least 
to visit — at least to see what it was 
all like. He could always return. 

Then there followed Dmitri’s 
visit to the ruins of Old New York 
which he enjoyed with artless ex- 
citement (but then there was no 
more magnificent spectacle of the 
useless gigantism of the pre-Cats 
than Old New York.) William 
began to wonder if the trip might 
not give him an opportunity to see 
some sights as well. 

He even began to think that for 
some time he had been considering 
the possibility of finding a new bed- 
mate, and it would be more con- 
venient to find one in another geo- 
graphical area where he would not 
stay permanently. 

— Or was it that even then, when 
he knew nothing but the barest be- 
ginning of what was needed, there 
had already come to him, like the 
twinkle of a distant lightning-flash, 
an answer? 

So he eventually went to Dallas 
and stepped out on the roof and 



there was Dmitri again, beaming. 
Then, with eyes narrowing, the 
little man turned and said, “I 
knew — ^what a remarkable resem- 
blance!” 

William’s eyes opened wide and 
there, visibly shrinking backward, 
was enough of his own face to make 
him certain at once that Anthony 
was standing before him. 

He read, very plainly, in An- 
thony’s face a longing to bury the 
relationship. All William needed to 
say was, ‘‘How remarkable!” and 
let it go. The gene-patterns of man- 
kind were complex enough, after 
all, to allow resemblances of any 
reasonable degree even without 
kinship. 

But of course William was a 
homologist and no one can work 
with the intricacies of the human 
brain without growing insensitive 
as to its details, so he said, ‘‘I’m 
sure this is Anthony, my brother.” 

Dmitri said, ‘‘Your brother?” 

‘‘My father,” said William, ‘‘had 
two boys by the same woman — my 
m’other. They were eccentric 
people.” 

He then stepped forward, hand 
outstretched, and Anthony had no 
choice but to take it. The incident 
was the topic of conversation, the 
only topic, for the next several 
days. 

V 

I T WAS small consolation to An- 
thony that William was contrite 



STRANGER IN PARADISE 



17 




enough when he realized what he 
had done. 

They sat together after dinner 
that night and William said, “My 
apologies. I thought that if we got 
the worst out at once that would 
end it. It doesn’t seem to have done 
so. I’ve signed no papers, made no 
formal agreement. I will leave.’’ 
“What good would that do?’’ 
said Anthony ungraciously. 
“Everyone knows now. Two bodies 
and one face. It’s enough to make 
one puke.’’ 

“If Heave—’’ 

“You can’t leave. This whole 
thing is my idea.’’ 

“To get me here?’’ William’s 
heavy lids lifted as far as they might 
and his eyebrows climbed. 

“No, of course not. To get a 
homologist here. How could I pos- 
sibly know they would send you/' 
“But if I leave — ’’ 

“No. The only thing we can do 
now is to lick the problem, if it can 
be done. Then it won’t matter.’’ 
(Everything is forgiven those who 
succeed, he thought.) 

“I don’t know that we can.’’ 
“We’ll have to try. Dmitri will 
place it on us. It’s too good a 
chance. You two are brothers,’’ 
Anthony said, mimicking Dmitri’s 
tenor voice, “and understand each 
other. Why not work together?” 
Then, in his own voice, angrily: “So 
we must. To begin with, what is it 
you do, William? I mean more pre- 
cisely than the word homology can 
explain by itself.” 



William sighed. “I work with 
autistic children.” 

“I’m afraid I don’t know what 
that means.” 

“Without going into a long song- 
and-dance, I deal with children 
who do not reach out into the 
world, do not communicate with 
others, but who sink into them- 
selves and exist behind a wall of 
skin, so far unreachably. I hope to 
be able to cure it some day.” 

“Is that why you call yourself 
Anti-Aut?” 

“Yes, as a matter of fact,” Wil- 
liam replied. 

Anthony laughed briefly, but he 
was not really amused. 

A chill crept into William’s 
manner. “It is an honest name.” • 

“I’m sure it is,” muttered An- 
thony hurriedly, and could bring 
himself to no more specific apology. 
With an effort, he restored the sub- 
ject, “Are you making any pro- 
gress?” 

“Toward the cure? No, so far. 
Toward understanding, yes. And 
the more I understand — ’’ Wil- 
liam’s voice grew warmer as he 
spoke and his eyes more distant. 
Anthony recognized it for what it 
was, the pleasure of speaking of 
what fills one’s heart and mind to 
the exclusion of almost everything 
else. He felt it himself often enough; 

He listened as closely as he might 
to something he didn’t really under- 
stand, for it was necessary to do so; 
he would expect William to listen to 
him. 



18 



IF 




How clearly he remembered it. 
He thought at the time he would 
not, but at the time, of course, he 
was not aware of what was happen- 
ing. Thinking back, in the glare of 
hindsight, he found himself re- 
membering whole sentences vir- 
tually word for word. 

“So it seemed to us,’’ William 
said, “that the autistic child was 
not failing to receive the impres- 
sions, or even failing to interpret 
them in quite a sophisticated 
manner. Rather, he disapproved 
and rejected them — without any 
loss of the potentiality of full com- 
munication if some impression 
could be found of which he ap- 
proved.’’ 

“Ah,” said Anthony, making 
just enough of a sound to indicate 
that he was listening. 

“Nor can you persuade him out 
of his autism in any ordinary way, 
for he disapproves of you just as 
much as he disapproves of the rest 
of the world. But if you place him 
in conscious arrest — ’’ 

“In what?’’ 

“It is a technique we have in 
which, in effect, the brain is 
divorced from the body and can 
perform its functions without ref- 
erence to the body. It is a rather 
sophisticated technique devised in 
our own laboratory; actually — ” 

“By yourself?” Anthony inter- 
rupted gently. 

“Well . yes,” said William, 
reddening slightly, but clearly 
pleased. “In conscious arrest,” he 



continued, “we can supply the body 
with designed fantasies and observe 
the brain under differential electro- 
encephalography. We can at once 
learn more about the autistic indi- 
vidual; what kind of sense impres- 
sions he most wants; and we learn 
more about the brain generally.” 
“Ah,” said Anthony. This time it 
was a real ah. “And all this you 
have learned about brains — can 
you not adapt it to the workings of 
a computer?” 

“No,” said William. “Not a 
chance. I told that to Dmitri. I 
know nothing about computers and 
not enough about brains.” 

“If I teach you about computers 
and tell you in detail what we need, 
what then?” 

“It won’t do. It — ” 

“Brother,” Anthony said, and he 
tried to make it an impressive 
word. “You owe me something. 
Please make an honest attempt to 
give our problem some thought. 
Whatever you know about the 
brain — please adapt it to our com- 
puters.” 

William shifted uneasily, and 
said, “I understand your position. I 
will try. I will honestly try.” 

VI 

\WT iLLiAM had tried, and as An- 
Vrthony had predicted, the two 
had been left to work together. At 
first, they encountered others noy^^ 
and then and William had tried to 



STRANGER IN PARADISE 



19 




use the shock value of the an- 
nouncement that they were 
brothers since there was no use in 
denial. Eventually, that stopped 
and there came to be a purposeful 
non-interference. When William 
approached Anthony, or Anthony 
approached William, anyone else 
who might be present faded silently 
into the walls. 

They even grew used to each 
other after a fashion, sometimes 
speaking to each other almost as 
though there were no resemblance 
at all, no childish memories in 
common. 

Anthony made the computer-re- 
quirements plain in reasonably 
non-technical language and Wil- 
liam, after long thought, explained 
how it seemed to him a computer 
might do the work, more or less, of 
a brain. 

Anthony said, “Would that be 
possible?” 

“I don’t know,” said William. “I 
am not eager to try. It may not 
work. But it may.” 

“We’d have to talk to Dmitri 
Large.” 

“Let’s talk it over ourselves first 
and see what we’ve got. We can go 
to him with as reasonable a propo- 
sition as we can put together. Or 
else, not go to him.” 

Anthony hesitated. “We both go 
to him?” 

William said, delicately, “You 
be my spokesman. There is no rea- 
son that we need be seen together.” 

“Thank you, William. If any- 



thing comes of this you will get full 
credit.” 

William said, “I have no worries 
about that. If there is anything to 
this, I will be the only one who can 
make it work, I suppose.” 

They thrashed it out through 
four or five meetings and if Anthony 
hadn’t been kin and if there hadn’t 
been that sticky, emotional situa- 
tion between them, William would 
have been uncomplicatedly pleased 
with the younger — brother — for his 
quick understanding of an alien 
field. 

There followed long conferences 
with Dmitri Large. Conferences 
with everyone, in fact. Anthony saw 
them through endless days and 
then they came to see William. 
Eventually, through an agonizing 
pregnancy, what came to be called 
the Mercury Computer, was bom. 

William then returned to New 
York with some relief. He did not 
plan to stay in New York (would he 
have thought that possible two 
months earlier?) but there was 
much to do at the Homological In- 
stitute. 

More conferences were neces- 
sary, of course, to explain to his 
own laboratory group what was 
happening and why he had to take 
leave and how they were to continue 
their own projects without him. 
Then there was a much more elabo- 
rate arrival at Dallas with the es- 
sential equipment and with two 
young aides for what would have to 
be an open-ended stay. 



20 



IF 




Nor did William even look back, 
figuratively speaking. His own lab- 
oratory and its needs faded from 
his thoughts. He was thoroughly 
committed to his new task. 

VII 

I T WAS the worst period for An- 
thony. The relief during Wil- 
liam’s absence had not penetrated 
deep and there began the nervous 
agony of wondering whether per- 
haps, hope against hope, he might 
not return. Might he not choose to 
send a deputy, someone else — any- 
one else? Anyone with a different 
face so that Anthony need not feel 
himself to be half of a two-bodied 
monster? 

But it was William. Anthony had 
watched the freight-plane come si- 
lently through the air, watched it 
unload from a distance. But even at 
that distance he had recognized 
William. 

That was that. Anthony left. 

He went to see Dmitri that after- 
noon. “It's not necessary, Dmitri, 
for me to stay, surely. We’ve 
worked out the details and someone 
else can take over/’ 

“No, No,’’ said Dmitri. “The 
idea was yours in the first place. 
You must see it through. There is 
no point in needlessly dividing the 
credit.’’ 

Anthony thought: No one else 
will take the risk. There’s still the 
chance of fiasco. I might have 
known. 



He had known, but he said 
stolidly, “You understand I cannot 
work with William.’’ 

“But why not?’’ Dmitri pretend- 
ed surprise. “You have been doing 
so well together.’’ 

“I have been straining my guts 
over it, Dmitri, and they won’t take 
any more. Don’t you suppose I 
know how it looks?’’ 

“My good fellow! You make too 
much of it. Sure the men stare. 
They are human after all. But 
they’ll get used to it. Fm used to 
it.’’ 

You are not, you fat liar, An- 
thony thought. He said. “Tm not 
used to it.” 

“You’re not looking at it prop- 
erly. Your parents were peculiar — 
but after all, what they did wasn’t 
illegal, only peculiar, only peculiar. 
Anyway, it’s not your fault, or Wil- 
liam’s. Neither of you is to blame.” 
“We carry the mark,” said An- 
thony, making a quick curving ges- 
ture of his hand to his face. 

“It’s not the mark you think. I 
see differences. You are distinctly 
younger in appearance. Your hair 
is wavier. It’s only at first glance 
that there is a . similarity. Come, 
Anthony, there will be all the time 
you want, all the help you need, all 
the equipment you can use. I’m 
sure it will work marvelously. Think 
of the satisfaction!” 

Anthony weakened, of course, 
and agreed to at least help William 
set up the equipment. William, 
too, seemed sure it would work 



STRANGER IN PARADISE 



21 




marvelously. Not as frenetically as 
did Dmitri, but with calm certi- 
tude. 

“It’s only a matter of the proper 
connections,’’ he said. “Though I 
must admit that that’s quite a huge 
‘only’. Your end of it will be to ar- 
range sensory impressions on an in- 
dependent screen so that we can 
exert — well, I can’t say manual 
control, can I? — so that we can 
exert intellectual control to over- 
ride, if necessary.’’ 

“That can be done,’’ said An- 
thony. 

“Then let’s get going. I’ll need a 
week at least to arrange the connec- 
tions and make sure of the in- 
structions — ’’ 

“Programing,’’ said Anthony. 

“Well, this is your place, so I’ll 
use your terminology. My assistants 
and I will program the Mercury 
Computer, but not in your 
fashion.’’ 

“I should hope not. We would 
want a homologist to set up a much 
more subtle program than anything 
a mere telemetrist could do.’’ He 
did not try to hide the self-hating 
irony in his words. 

William let the tone go and ac- 
cepted the words. He said, “We’ll 
begin simply. We’ll have the robot 
walk.” 

VIII 

A WEEK LATER, the robot walked 
in Arizona, a thousand miles 
away. He walked stiffly and some- 



times he fell down. Sometimes he 
clanked his ankle against an ob- 
struction, whirled on one foot and 
went off in a surprising new direc- 
tion. 

“He’s a baby, learning to walk,” 
said William. 

Dmitri came occasionally, to 
learn of progress. “That’s remark- 
able,” he would say. 

Anthony didn’t think so. Weeks 
passed, then months. The robot 
had progressively done more and 
more, as the Mercury Computer 
had been placed, progressively, 
under a more and more complex 
programing. (William had a ten- 
dency to refer to the Mercury Com- 
puter as a brain, but Anthony 
wouldn’t allow it.) And. all the 
progress wasn’t good enough. 

“It’s not good enough, William,” 
he said, finally. He had not slept 
the night before. 

“Isn’t that strange?” said Wil- 
liam, coolly. “I was going to say 
that I thought we had it about 
beaten.” 

Anthony held himself together 
with difficulty. The strain of work- 
ing with William and of watching 
the robot fumble was more than he 
could bear. “I’m going to resign, 
William. The whole job. I’m sorry. 
It’s not you — ” 

“But it is I, Anthony.” 

“It isn’t all you, William. It’s 
failure. We won’t make it. You see 
how clumsily the robot handles 
himself, even though he’s on Earth, 
only a thousand miles away, with

the signal round-trip only a tiny 
fraction of a second in time. On 
Mercury, there will be minutes of 
delay, minutes for which the Mer- 
cury Computer will have to allow. 
It’s madness to think it will work.” 

William said, ‘‘Don’t resign, An- 
thony. You can’t resign now. I 
suggest we have the robot sent to 
Mercury. I’m convinced he’s 
ready.” 

Anthony laughed loudly and in- 
sultingly. ‘‘You’re crazy, William.” 

‘‘I’m not. You seem to think it 
will be harder on Mercury, but it 
won’t be. It’s harder on Earth. This 
robot is designed for 1/3 Earth- 
normal gravity, and he’s working in 
Arizona at full gravity. He’s design- 
ed for 400° C. and he’s got 30° C. 
He’s designed for vacuum and he’s 
working in an atmospheric soup.” 

‘‘That robot can take the differ- 
ence.” 

‘‘The metal structure can, I sup- 
pose, but what about the Computer 
right here? It doesn’t work well 
with a robot that isn’t in the envir- 
onment he’s designed for. Look, 
Anthony, if you want a computer 
that is as complex as a brain, you 
have to allow for idiosyncracies. 
Come, let’s make a deal. If you will 
help me push to have the robot sent 
to Mercury, it will be six months en 
route and I will take a sabbatical 
for that period. You will be rid of 
me. 

‘‘Who’ll take care of the Mercury 
Computer?” 

‘‘By now, you understand how it

works well enough and I’ll have my 
two men here to help you ” 

Anthony shook his head de- 
fiantly, “I can’t take the respon- 
sibility for the Computer, and I 
won’t take the responsibility for 
suggesting that the robot be sent to 
Mercury. It won’t work.” 

‘‘I’m sure it will.” 

‘‘You can’t be sure. And the re- 
sponsibility is mine. I’m the one 
who’ll bear the blame. It will be 
nothing to you.” 

Anthony later remembered this 
as a crucial moment. William 
might have let it go. Anthony would 
have resigned. All would have been 
lost. 

But William said, ‘‘Nothing to 
me? Look, Dad had this thing 
about Mom. All right. I’m sorry, 
too. I’m sorry as anyone can 
be — but it’s done, and something 
odd has resulted. When I speak of 
Dad, I mean your Dad, too, and 
there’s lots of pairs of people who 
can say that: two brothers, two sis- 
ters, a brother-and-sister. And then 
when I say Mom, I mean your 
Mom, and there are lots of pairs 
who can say that, too. But I don’t 
know any other pair, nor have I 
heard of any other pair, who share 
both Dad and Mom.” 

‘‘I know that,” said Anthony, 
grimly. 

‘‘Yes, but look at it from my 
standpoint,” said William, hur- 
riedly. ‘‘I’m a homologist. I work 
with gene patterns. Have you ever 
thought of our gene-patterns? We 



24 



IF 




share both parents which means 
that our gene-patterns are closer 
than any other pair on this planet. 
Our very faces show it.” 

“I know that, too.” 

“So that if this project were to 
work, and if you were to gain glory 
from it; it would be your gene- 
pattern that would have been 
proven highly useful to mankind — 
and that would mean my gene- 
pattern as well. Don’t you see, 
Anthony? I share your parents, 
your face, your gene- pattern, and 
therefore your glory or your dis- 
grace. It is mine almost as much as 
yours and if any credit or blame 
adheres it adheres to both of us. 
I’ve got to be interested in your 
success. I’ve a motive for that 
which no one else on Earth has — a 
purely selfish one, one so selfish 
you can be sure it’s there. I’m on 
your side, Anthony, because you’re 
very nearly me!” 

They looked at each other for a 
long time. For the first time An- 
thony did so without noticing the 
face they shared. 

William said, “So let us request 
that the robot be sent to Mercury.” 
And Anthony gave in. After 
Dmitri had approved the request — 
he had been waiting to, after all — 
Anthony spent much of the day in 
deep thought. 

Then he sought out William and 
said, “Listen!” 

There was a long pause which 
William did not break. 

Anthony said again, “Listen!” 



William waited patiently. 
Anthony said, “There’s really no 
need for you to leave. I’m sure you 
wouldn’t like to have the Mercury 
Computer tended by anyone but 
yourself.” 

William said, “You mean you 
intend to leave?” 

Anthony said, ‘‘No, I’ll stay, 
too.” 

William said, “We needn’t see 
much of each other.” 

All of this had been, for An- 
thony, like speaking with a pair of 
hands clenched about his windpipe. 
The pressure seemed to tighten 
now, but he managed the hardest 
statement of all. 

“We don’t have to avoid each 
other. We don’t have to.” 

William smiled rather uncertain- 
ly. Anthony didn’t smile at all; he 
left quickly. 

IX 

W ILLIAM looked up from his 
book. It was at least a month 
since he had ceased being vaguely 
surprised at having Anthony enter. 
He said, “Anything wrong?” 
“Who can say? They’re coming 
in for the soft-landing. Is the Mer- 
cury Computer in action?” 

William was aware his brother 
knew the Computer status perfect- 
ly, but he said, “By tomorrow 
morning, Anthony.” 

“And there are no problems.” 
“None at all.” 

“Then we have to wait for the 



STRANGER IN PARADISE 



25 




soft-landing.” 

“Yes.” 

Anthony said, ‘‘Something will 
go wrong.” 

‘‘Nothing will go wrong.” 

‘‘So much work wasted.” 

‘‘It’s not wasted yet. It won’t 
be.” 

Anthony said, “Maybe you’re 
right.” Hands deep in his pockets 
he drifted away, stopped at the 
door. ‘‘Thanks!” 

‘‘For what, Anthony?” 

‘‘For being . comforting.” 
William smiled wryly and was re- 
lieved his own emotions didn’t 
show. 

X 

Virtually the entire staff of the 
Mercury Project was on hand for 
the crucial moment. Anthony, who 
had no tasks to perform, remained 
well to the rear, eyes on the moni- 
tors. The robot had been activated 
and there were visual messages 
being returned. 

At least, they came out as the 
equivalent of visual. As yet they 
showed nothing but a dim glow of 
light which was presumably Mer- 
cury’s surface. 

Shadows flitted across the screen, 
probably irregularities on that, sur- 
face. Anthony couldn’t tell by eye 
alone, but those at the controls, 
who were analyzing the data by 
methods more subtle than could be 
disposed of by unaided eye, seemed 
calm. None of the little red lights 
that might have betokened emer- 



gency were lighting. Anthony was 
watching the key observers rather 
than the screen. 

He should be down with William 
and the others at the Computer. It 
was going to be thrown in only 
when the soft-landing was made. 
He should be. He couldn't be. 

The shadows flitted across the 
screen more rapidly. The robot was 
descending — too quickly? Surely, 
too quickly! 

There was a last blur and a 
steadiness, a shift of focus in which 
the blur grew darker, then fainter. 
A sound was heard and there were 
perceptible seconds before Anthony 
realized that what he heard was, 
‘‘Soft-landing achieved! Soft-land- 
ing achieved!” 

The murmur arose and became 
an excited hum of self-congratula- 
tion until one more change took 
place on the screen and the sound 
of human words and laughter was 
stopped as though there had been a 
smash-collision against a wall of 
silence. 

For the screen changed; changed 
and grew sharp. In the brilliant, 
brilliant sunlight, blazing through 
the carefully filtered screen, they 
could now see a boulder — clear, 
burning white on one side, ink-on- 
ink on the other. It shifted right, 
then back to left, as though a pair 
of eyes were looking left, then right. 
A metal hahd appeared on the 
screen as though the robot was 
looking at a part of itself. 

It was Anthony’s voice that cried 



26 



IF 




out at last, “The Computer’s been 
thrown in.’’ 

He heard the words as though 
someone else had shouted it and he 
raced out and down the stairs and 
through a corridor, leaving the 
babble of voices to rise behind him. 

“William,’’ he cried, as he burst 
into the Computer room, “it’s per- 
fect, it’s — ’’ 

But William’s hand was uprais- 
ed. “Shh. Please. I don’t want any 
sensations entering except those 
from the robot.’’ 

“You mean we can be heard?’’ 
whispered Anthony. 

“Maybe not, but I don’t know.’’ 
There was another screen, a smaller 
one, in the room with the Mercury 
Computer. The scene on it was 
different, and changing; the robot 
was moving. 

William said, “The robot is 
feeling its way. Those steps have 
got to be clumsy. There’s a seven- 
minute delay between stimulus and 
response and that has to be allowed 
for.’’ 

“But already he’s walking more 
surely than he ever did in Arizona. 
Don’t you think so, William? Don’t 
you think so?’’ Anthony was grip- 
ping William’s shoulder, shaking 
it, eyes never leaving the screen. 

William said, “I’m sure of it, 
Anthony.’’ 

T ie Sun burned down in a warm 
contrasting world of white and 
black, of white Sun against black 



sky and white rolling ground 
mottled with black shadow. The 
bright sweet smell of the Sun on 
every exposed square centimeter of 
metal contrasting with the creeping 
death -of- aroma on the other side. 

He lifted his hand and stared at 
it, counting the fingers. Hot-hot- 
hot — turning, putting each finger, 
one by one, into the shadow of the 
others and the hot slowly dying in a 
change in tactility that made him 
feel the clean, comfortable vacuum. 

Yet not entirely vacuum. He 
straightened and lifted both arms 
over his head, stretching them out, 
and the sensitive spots on either 
wrist felt the vapors — the thin, 
faint touch of tin and lead rolling 
through the cloy of mercury. 

The thicker taste rose from his 
feet; the silicates of each variety, 
marked by the clear separate-and- 
together touch and tang of each 
metal ion. He moved one foot 
slowly through the crunchy, caked 
dust, felt the changes like a soft, 
not-quite-random symphony. 

And overall, the Sun. He looked 
up at it, fat and bright and hot and 
he heard its joy. He watched the 
slow rise of prominences around its 
rim and listened to their crackling 
sound; and to the other happy 
noises over the broad face. When 
he dimmed the background light, 
the red of the rising wisps of hydro- 
gen showed in bursts of mellow 
contralto, and the deep bass of the 
spots amid the muted whistling of 
the wispy, moving faculae. and the 



STRANGER IN PARADISE 



27 




occasional thin keening of a flare, 
the ping-pong ticking of gamma 
rays and cosmic particles, and over 
all in every direction the soft, 
fainting, and ever-renewed sigh of 
the Sun’s substance rising and re- 
treating forever in a cosmic wind 
which reached out and bathed him 
in glory. 

He jumped, rose slowly in the air 
with a freedom he had never felt, 
and jumped again when he landed, 
and ran, and jumped, and ran 
again, with a body that responded 
perfectly to this glorious world, this 
paradise in which he found himself. 

A stranger so long and so lost — 
in paradise at last. 

«««*««*«*«** 

W ILLIAM said, “It’s all right.’’ 
“But what’s he doing?'' cried 
out Anthony. 

“It’s all right. The programing is 
working. He has tested his senses. 
He has been making the various 
visual observations. He has dimmed 
the Sun and studied it. He has 
tested for atmosphere and for the 
chemical nature of the soil. It all 
works.’’ 

“But why is he running?’’ 

“I rather think that’s his own 
idea. If you want to program a com- 
puter as complicated as a brain, 
you’ve got to expect it to have ideas 
of its own.’’ 

“Running? Jumping?’’ Anthony 
turned an anxious face to William. 
“He’ll hurt himself. You can handle 



the Computer. Override. Make him 
stop,’’ 

And William said sharply. “No. 
I won’t. I’ll take the chance of his 
hurting himself. Don’t you under- 
stand? He’s happy. He was on 
Earth, a world he was never 
equipped to handle. Now he’s on 
Mercury with a body perfectly 
adapted to its environment, as per- 
fectly adapted as a hundred specia- 
lized scientists could make it. It’s 
paradise for him; let him enjoy it.’’ 

“Enjoy? He’s a robot.’’ 

“I’m not talking about the robot. 
I’m talking about the brain — the 
brain — here." He pointed. 

The Mercury Computer, enclosed 
in glass, carefully and delicately 
wired, its integrity most subtly pre- 
served, breathed and lived. 

“It’s Randall who’s in paradise,’’ 
said William. “He’s found the 
world for whose sake he autistically 
fled this one. He has a world his 
new body fits perfectly in exchange 
for the world his old body did not 
fit at all.’’ 

Anthony watched the screen in 
wonder. “He seems to be quiet- 
ing.’’ 

“Of course,’’ said William, “and 
he’ll do his job all the better for his 

joy.” 

Anthony smiled and said, “We’ve 
done it, then, you and I? Shall we 
join the rest and let them fawn on 
us, William?’’ 

William said, “Together?’’ 

And Anthony linked arms. “To- 
gether, brother!’’ •

IF 




GUEST 

EDITORIAL 

FRED POHL 



o IF has a new editor . 

It isn’t the first time, /f hasn’t 
yet hit a quarter-century of history, 
but in its span /fhas had, 1 think, 
more editors than any other 
science-fiction magazine in the 
world: Ejler Jakobsson, and Horace 
Gold, and Damon Knight and five 
or six others. I edited it myself for, 
let’s see, about nine years, which 
may be the all-time record for 
hanging on ’to this editor-devouring 
spot. 

An editor is a middleman. He 
stands between the publisher and 
the writer; between the writer and 
the reader; between the artist and 
the printer; he devotes his life to 
trying to make these irreconcilable 
pairs somehow play nicely together. 
It isn’t easy. Every day he has to 
fight the same fight one more time, 
to convince the publisher that 
writers have to have enough money 



to live on, and the writers that pub- 
lishers are entitled to make a profit. 
Three-quarters of his time is spent 
on reconciling differences, of on 
pesty little details (circulation pro- 
motion; publicity; fitting together 
issues; assigning art; checking en- 
gravings; etc., etc.) that most read- 
ers have never heard of. With 
what’s left he tries to find and print 
masterpieces. 

How do you go about doing that? 

There are as many ways as there 
are editors, I suppose: 

The idealist. He has in his mind 
a perfect vision of the optimum sf 
magazine, and sets about finding 
writers to produce the stories to 
make it real. John Campbell was 
that kind of editor. He paid no at- 
tention to what anyone else was do- 
ing, cared nothing for “big names’’; 
he just decided what kind of sf 
stories could be written that readers 
would like to read and bent a whole 
generation of newcomers to his 
will — in the course of which he 
made them into the top profes- 
sionals in the field. This is hard 
work and, of course, it only suc- 
ceeds if the editor’s perfect vision 
does in fact correspond to what an 
audience wants. When the ideal of 
the editor is something that appeals 
only to him, even a success of this 
kind is a failure. 

The imitator. He studies what 
everyone else is doing and carefully 
manufactures a package indistin- 
guishable from everyone else’s. 
There have been a lot of these 




29 




editors in science fiction. In the 
boom periods (the late thirties, for 
instance, or the mid-fifties), when 
everyone with the price of a print- 
ing job seemed to be hitting the 
stands with a couple of sf titles, 
there were dozens of copies of 
copies, synthesized out of the same 
ingredients as Astounding and If. 
These didn’t work very well; nearly 
all of them folded at the first cold 
draft of reader resistance. 

The eclectic. He takes what he 
can from wherever he can find use- 
ful things. He does the best he can. 

There have been good editors of 
all these kinds. The best editors 
have been all of them, as needed. 

The best editors, in fact, change 
their image of what they want 
pretty frequently, because science 
fiction itself changes. It grows and 
develops; it opens new territories 
and explores them. The stories that 
are being published this month, in 
1974, couldn’t have been published 
in 1964 or 1954 — they probably 
couldn’t have been written then. 
Writers learn from each other. 
Every time a new writer comes 
along with some new idea, some 
fresh way of looking at the world, 
some previously neglected approach 
to the potential of the future, he 
adds to the resources of all of us. 

I have enjoyed reading science 
fiction for a long time. I’ve enjoyed 
numberless stories. Even more, I’ve 
enjoyed watching the field grow. 
And the best place to watch it is in 
a magazine. 



I say this with no personal axe to 
grind. I am not editing sf maga- 
zines any more, and I see no reason 
why I ever would. But if they ever 
stopped being published — no 

matter how many books, films and 
television programs took their 
place — I would be very unhappy in- 
deed. For one thing, books simply 
take too long to happen. If a writer 
thinks of a fine new idea today — 
say, in June of 1974 — and decides 
to write it as a novel, it is June of 
1975 before it is finished, and June 
of 1976 before it is published — and 
1977 before it begins to fertilize 
new ideas in other writers, enrich- 
ing the field. Magazines have 
shorter cycles; the short story or 
novelette gets written in a few 
weeks or so, gets into print by the 
end of the year, and is part of the 
common heritage before twelve 
months are gone. 

And there is another reason why 
I would hate to see the day when sf 
magazines were no more: because 
they were, are and will be for the 
foreseeable future the very best 
place for new writers to display 
their wares. For half a dozen years 
or more, when I was editing If, I 
made it a policy to publish at least 
one story in every issue by a writer 
who had never sold a science-fiction 
story before. Other magazines were 
less formally committed to finding 
new talent, but all of them, every 
one of them that amounted to any- 
thing in all the history of science 
fiction, in one way or another was 



30 



IF 




continually searching for fresh 
writers with fresh things to say. 

How does the fresh talent get dis- 
covered? 

There’s only one way. Week after 
week, a magazine like If gets some- 
thing close to a hundred manu- 
script-sized envelopes from un- 
known writers all over the country, 
in fact all over the world. They are 
“the slush pile” — a rather unat- 
tractive name, although often 
enough richly deserved. But among 
the slush from time to time one 
finds nuggets of gold; some person, 
out in Baton Rouge or Bu^alo or 
Berkeley, has read a lot of science 
fiction and decided he can write it 
as well as some of what he sees in 
print. About one time in a thou- 
sand he (or she) is right — and a new 
professional writer is born. 

But without the science fiction 
magazines, where will that novice 
go? Probably he will go nowhere. 
The stories will stay in his desk 
drawer, if he writes them at all. The 
mood will pass. He will reconcile 
himself to a career in real estate or 
laundromat servicing . and we 
will all lose, perhaps, another Hein- 
lein or E. E. Smith. 

1 MUST admit there’s a little bit of 
jealousy in my heart as I write 
this. Editing a science-fiction 
magazine is not only work, it is a 
great deal of fun — in some ways 
more so than editing books, which 
is what I am now doing for 
Bantam. 



Bantam is fun too, in a different 
way. Many of the writers I am pub- 
lishing at Bantam are the same 
writers I was happy to publish in 
Galaxy and If. Mack Reynolds was 
a standby in the magazines, and I 
have him committed to one or two 
Bantam Books titles a year. I know 
he’ll do well; we took a mail poll of 
you readers one year, and to every- 
one’s astonishment, including 
Mack’s, the most popular author 
we published was Mack Reynolds. 

Doris Piserchia (Star Rider), 
Frank Herbert {Helstrom's Hive), 
John Brunner {The Web of Every- 
where), James Blish (the Star Trek 
adaptations) — they all were con- 
tributors to the magazines. So was 
Samual R. Delany, whose immense 
and trail -blazing novel Dhalgren 
I’ll be publishing under the Bantam 
imprint a few months from now. I 
don’t think Dhalgren could have 
been published in a magazine, if 
only because of its size — it is about 
five times as long as an average 
issue of a magazine. And I would 
not have missed the experience of 
working with Delany on this, his 
biggest and most innovative work 
in a distinguished career. 

UT STILL — 

There is that little spot of jea- 
lousy. 1 think with some nostalgia 
of those 4,000 slushpile manu- 
scripts each year, and the good 
stories that from time to time 
popped out of the pile .

HOUSE DIVIDED 



Is there any crueler kindness 
than to pity one’s enemy? 



ROBERT SILVERBERG 



r i THE language of the tribe 
closest to the Terran settlement 
the planet’s name was Hranth, 
which meant, expectably enough, 
“The World.” Since the planet had 
no name of Terran giving other 
than Gamma Trianguli Australis 
VII, which was cumbersome in the 
extreme, Terran Commander Le- 
noir decided that the world would 
be known to the records as 
Hranth — at least conditionally. 

It was a fairly promising planet, 
Martin Lenoir thought. The civilian 
colonists seemed to take to it well. 
It was Earthlike to six places; it had 
acceptable gravity, breathable air, 
drinkable water. The chemical con- 
stitution of its soil was such that 
Terran food-plants could grow 
there. The local plants and animals 
were metabolically assimilable in 
Terran stomachs, too. 

Hranth was inhabited by hu- 
manoids in a primitive pretechno- 



logical state. The local tribe had 
raised no objections when the 
Terran colonizing force of five hun- 
dred had landed. So long as the 
Terrans kept their settlement ten or 
fifteen miles away from the borders 
of their village the natives did not 
care what happened. 

After all, the old chief had ex- 
plained, they did not own the entire 
planet. Merely their own tribal 
area, carved out centuries before. 
They had no interest in what be- 
came of land belonging to no one, 
or even to other tribes. The Terrans 
were free to take what they wanted. 

Work had proceeded smoothly 
during the initial ten days of the 
colony’s existence. Lenoir was an 
experienced leader and his cadre of 
Colonial Corps men worked hard 
alongside the greenhorn civilians to 
build the colony. They had brought 
plenty of prefab dwellings, of 
course, but these were only tempo- 



34 




rary; eventually the forest of sturdy 
flaky-barked trees nearby would be 
converted into homes for the 
Terra n settlers. 

By that time, though, Lenoir and 
his men would have withdrawn 
from the operation, leaving the 
settlers on their own and moving on 
to act as midwives and godfathers 
to some other Terran colony on 
some other planet. 

One of the most important jobs 
was learning to communicate with 
the natives. The O’Neill Translator 
was a limited device at best, 
capable of rendering generalities in 
an awkward way but utterly unable 
to handle the delicacies of a diplo- 
matic relationship. For that reason, 
two of the civilian women and one 
of Lenoir’s staff linguists were at 
work building up a working vocab- 
ulary of Hranth words. 

Since everything was going along 
so well it came as a considerable 
jolt to Lenoir when, one morning, 
an alien from the nearby village 
showed up, speaking a language no 
one had ever heard before. 

1 ENOIR had been busy, sketching 
j out plans for an irrigation sys- 
tem. This section of Hranth was 
rather on the dry side. He was in 
the midst of the job when Sergeant 
Becker of Linguistics rapped on the 
beam of his door and entered. 
“Well? What is it. Sergeant?’’ 
“We have a visitor, sir. Alien. 
From the village. Can’t understand 
a word he’s saying.’’ 



Lenoir frowned and put down his 
stylo. He was a big man, heavy-set, 
bull-voiced, with creased leathery 
skin. He swivelled slowly around 
and stared at the pale, slim linguis- 
tics specialist. “You can’t under- 
stand him?’’ 

“Not a word. It’s an entirely dif- 
ferent language. We’re setting up 
the O’Neill now, but we thought 
you’d like to hear the interview.’’ 
“Yes,’’ Lenoir said thoughtfully. 
“I guess I do want to hear this.’’ 
At the moment the colony con- 
sisted of a ring of prefab domes ar- 
ranged in a loose open circle 
around a clearing. The permanent 
settlers had put those up under the 
direction of Lenoir’s staff. At the 
far end of the circle, temporary 
tents had been erected. Lenoir 
crossed from his tent to the one in 
which the linguistics interviews 
were being held. 

He found the civilian linguists 
bustling around in the process of 
setting up the complex affair that 
was the O’Neill Translator, while a 
white-thatched little alien watched 
them mildly and with small show of 
interest. The women glanced up as 
Lenoir entered, followed closely by 
Lieutenant Becker. 

“How long has the alien been 
here?’* Lenoir asked. 

Mary Delacorte said, “He came 
about fifteen minutes ago. We 
thought he was the same one who 
had been here yesterday — it’s so 
hard to tell them apart, you know. 
Commander,’’ she added with a 



HOUSE DIVIDED 



35 




shrug of her plump shoulders. 

“Yes,” Grace Walton said. 
Grace was a rugged-looking girl in 
her early thirties; good colonial 
stock. “We couldn’t tell this one 
from any of the others until he 
started talking. The language 
didn’t even faintly resemble the one 
we’ve been studying.” 

“Are you sure he isn’t playing 
some kind of joke on you?” 

. “1 doubt that,” Becker put in. 
“He seemed so damned anxious to 
communicate. As if he would ex- 
plode if he didn’t tell us what he 
came here to let us know.” 

Almost as if on cue, the alien 
began to speak. Lenoir looked 
closely at the creature. He was 
humanoid, and on the scrawny 
side — five feet tall, perhaps as 
much as five feet two. His skin was 
dark red in color, and it hung bag- 
ging out in loose leathery folds at 
his joints and under his chin. The 
alien’s arms appeared to dangle 
almost to his knees, and they ter- 
minated in seven bony four-jointed 
fingers that tangled nervously with 
each other while he spoke. He wore 
only a coarse, ragged loincloth 
fashioned from some gray woven 
material. 

Frowning, Lenoir listened with 
care to the stream of alien syllables 
that came from the being’s thin 
lips. The Commander was not a 
trained linguist, and since he never 
stayed on a planet of colonization 
more than two or three months he 
did not trouble to weigh his mind 



down with the language; there were 
plenty of specialists who could take 
care of that, leaving him free to 
perform more fitting tasks on the 
organizational level. 

But he had spent a good deal of 
time listening to the speech of the 
aliens on Hranth, and he had to 
admit that whatever this one was 
saying, he was saying it in an en- 
tirely different tongue. 

“You notice the difference, sir?” 
Becker said. “The Hranth language 
we’ve been studying is liquid and 
vowel -rich. What this fellow’s say- 
ing is a mass of rough consonants.” 

Lenoir nodded brusquely. “Hook 
up the O’Neill. Let’s find out 
what’s going on.” 

The O’Neill Translator was a for- 
midable piece of hardware that 
took up a good chunk of the tent 
area, much of the space being de- 
voted to the cryostat section that 
kept its computer elements at oper- 
ating temperature. Becker checked 
the gauges along the control panel 
and nodded finally; the Translator 
had reached its functional tempera- 
ture. 

Lenoir picked up the microphone 
and said slowly, in English, “I am 
the Earthman Commander. Tell us 
who you are.” 

Since the machine had no 
samples of the alien’s language to 
operate with, it merely reproduced 
Lenoir’s words as they had been 
spoken. But the sound was enough 
to touch off another flood of alien 
words, which the Translator’s pick- 



36 



IF 




up grids recorded and passed along 
to the elaborate cryotronic com- 
puter that was the central element 
of the O’Neill Translator. 

Rapidly the words were broken 
down, analyzed phonemically, sort- 
ed, classified, arranged. They were 
compared with roughly analogous 
specimens from a hundred other 
languages; they were distributed 
along a theoretical mathematically- 
weighed meaning-scale. Then they 
were translated by crude analog 
into English. The entire operation 
took no more than a few seconds. 

The Translator said, “I am 
(proper name) Dulizd of the (tribal- 
name) Trazzidovh.” 

“Where is your village?” Lenoir 
asked. 

The O’Neill rendered his ques- 
tion quickly into rasping coarse 
alien syllables and the alien re- 
sponded; after a brief time-lag the 
machine said, “My village is be- 
yond the hill, at the edge of the 
great plain.” 

“How can that be?” Becker 
whispered, keeping his voice below 
the range of the translator’s audi- 
bility-threshold. “That’s theHranth 
village at the edge of the plain!” 

Lenoir asked for a more specific 
location; the alien was unable to 
give one, or at least the Translator 
could not render it. Conversing by 
O’Neill was a slow and tortuous 
process, and Very frequently an in- 
accurate one — ^though a feedback 
circuit enabled the machine to 
correct earlier misinterpretations as 



further conversation increased its 
understanding of the language. 

Lenoir found himself starting to 
sweat as the questioning went on. 
He persevered. 

And, after an hour of dogged 
plugging, a strange and disturbing 
story began to take form. 

T he village at the edge of the 
great plain, the alien told them, 
had been built long ago — nearly 
two thousand years ago. Lenoir was 
willing to accept the figure as a rea- 
sonable one. Time moved slowly on 
this world of dry fields and mudfiat 
houses, and there was no reason 
why a village could not endure for 
year after static year while millenia 
slipped by. 

The Hranth had built the village 
and it had been their home. 
Another tribe, the Trazzidovh, had 
lived several hundred miles to the 
west: a semi-nomadic warrior tribe, 
fierce and self-reliant, ethnically 
closely related to the placid mud- 
dwelling Hranth but culturally 
quite different. 

The two tribes had maintained a 
hazy kind of relationship for several 
centuries. Communications were 
poor on the planet, and often a 
decade or more might go by 
without a visit between the tribes. 
Still, for many years, the Hranth 
had been suggesting that their 
sturdier cousins should send a con- 
tingent of warriors to live in the 
Hranth village and serve as pro- 
tectors. The Hranth had few 



HOUSE DIVIDED 



37 




enemies, but those few were annoy- 
ing ones, and the unwarlike Hranth 
did not enjoy combat or even the 
thought of it. 

The Trazzidovh did — but the 
Trazzidovh were not interested in 
making a journey of three or four 
hundred miles eastward to the 
Hranth village. They were content 
to remain where they were. And so 
matters rested, for many hundreds 
of years. 

Until the day when the Trazzi- 
dovh took on an enemy too big for 
them to handle: the well-organized 
and ferocious Lurrnzil, a large tribe 
ranging the western mountains, 
who responded to a Trazzidovh at- 
tack by virtually annihilating them. 

Only two hundred of the tribe 
survived the fierce conflict. Now, 
decimated, too weak to endure the 
hazards of life in the open plains of 
the west, the Trazzidovh remem- 
bered the many-times-repeated plea 
of their Hranth cousins. The 
Hranth once again extended an in* 
vitation; it would be acceptable for 
the Trazzidovh remnant to take re- 
fuge in the village of the Hranth. 

Wearily the beaten Trazzidovh 
made the long trek eastward to 
settle in the land of the Hranth. 
Arriving, they were surprised to 
find their cousins under attack by 
local enemies; gathering their shat- 
tered forces, they drove the at- 
tackers off and were welcomed 
warmly by the Hranth. 

But the warmth was short-lived. 
The Hranth, now that their enemies 



had been driven off, felt no further 
need for the newcomers, and re- 
fused to give them the choice land 
they had been promised. Too tired 
to return to their homeland, the 
Trazzidovh reluctantly accepted a 
barren strip near a ravine at the 
extreme western edge of the Hranth 
domain. Bitterly, they cursed the 
cousins who had invited them to 
seek refuge only with the hidden in- 
tention of using them as catspaws. 

Matters remained in a state of 
stasis, and the position continued 
even up to the arrival of the Earth- 
men, according to Dulizd of the 
Trazzidovh. The Hranth numbered 
nearly 5000; the Trazzidovh stilt 
had not increased their original 200 
even after the passage of three cen- 
turies. 

They lived on, a small, proud 
minority in the midst of the 
Hranth. They clung to their own 
language and way of life, though 
they had also learned the Hranth 
tongue so that communication 
between the tribes would be pos- 
sible. The Hranth had never both- 
ered to study the Trazzidovh langu- 
age; they regarded the tribe-frag- 
ment as too thoroughly inferior to 
trouble with. 

The Hranth disliked the Traz- 
zidovh, who were aloof, warlike 
people, and kept them in poverty 
lest they breed and grow to out- 
number the milder but numerically 
superior Hranth. Yet the tribes 
lived together in identical mud 
huts, with no perceptible boundary 



38 



IF 




between the Hranth district and 
that of the Trazzidovh, in a state of 
perpetual and bloodless civil war. 

The Hranth village, Lenoir 
thought when the alien had finished 
his recitation, was a house divided. 
The situation suddenly made the 
business of settling on this planet a 
great deal more complicated. 

B y the time the tale was told, 
the O’Neill translator had ac- 
quired a fairly good grasp of the 
new language. Communication be. 
tween the Earthmen and their 
visitor was reasonably fluent by 
now. 

Lenoir said, “So the Hranth 
chief granted us permission to 
settle in the neighborhood without 
even informing the Trazzidovh of 
our arrival?” 

‘‘That is right. Last night we ac- 
cidentally learned that beings from 
the stars had arrived on the world.” 
(The Trazzidovh word for world, 
interestingly enough, was hranth. 
Evidently there had been some 
borrowing from the Hranth langu- 
age, in one direction and perhaps 
both, Lenoir thought.) 

He eyed the scrawny but some- 
how dignified old alien and said, 
‘‘Well? Do the Trazzidovh object to 
our presence on this world?” 

‘‘The Trazzidovh are too few to 
object to anyone’s presence any- 
where,” returned the alien simply. 
‘‘I have come here for a different 
reason. I wish to offer the services 
of my people.” 



“Services?” 

“Yes. We will help you build 
your homes, plough your fields, 
bring you water and animals. In 
return you can give us food, medi- 
cine for our sick ones, teach us your 
ways of farming and living. We 
wish to learn.” 

Lenoir darted a glance at Becker, 
who did not react. It's an interest- 
ing proposition, the Terran com- 
mander thought. They want to 
work for us. That’s a lot better than 
the attitude of the Hranth, who 
don’t seem to care a damn what we 
do so long as we leave them alone. 

Aloud he said, “Very well. You 
can tell your people that any of 
them who want to work for us can 
come here tomorrow morning.” 
The alien jacknifed into a sinu- 
ous genuflection. “I give thanks.” 
“And,” Lenoir said, “you can 
pass the word along to your neigh- 
bors the Hranth, too. We can use 
all the help we can get.” 

Dulizd of the Trazzidovh 
straightened up abruptly and stared 
at the Earthman with what seemed 
to be a reproachful gaze. He said, 
“I do not think the Hranth will be 
interested in working for you.” 
Lenoir shrugged. “They can do 
as they please. We’ll manage 
without them.” 

The alien left shortly afterward. 
Lenoir said to the members of the 
linguistics team, “Suppose you type 
out a transcript of this interview 
and send it across to me right 
away.” 



HOUSE DIVIDED 



39 




“Yes, sir,” Becker said. “I’ll get 
on it at once.” 

“And I suggest you de-empha- 
size the study of the Hranth lan- 
guage and start learning Trazzi- 
dovh. I have a feeling we’ll be doing 
a lot more business with them than 
with the Hranth.” 

Lenoir ducked out of the tent 
and made his way across the clear- 
ing to his own headquarters. The 
sun, G-type and big, was high over- 
head now and cutting loose at full 
strength; even in his light tropics 
uniform, Lenoir was sweating. He 
had little enough fat on his 230- 
pound frame as it was, but he 
expected that whatever suet there 
was would be steamed off him be- 
fore he completed the job of setting 
up the Terran colony on this world. 

A job which had suddenly be- 
come more appealing, he thought, 
if at the same time more difficult. 
Lenoir liked the little alien who had 
come to the camp today. He appre- 
ciated the kind of battler who could 
cling to life no matter how many 
times he got clubbed across the eye- 
brows— and the plucky Trazzidovh, 
beaten and decimated and tricked 
and yet stilKable to approach 
visitors from space without fear and 
ask for a job, were the sort of 
people he could respect. 

Of course, he hadn’t heard the 
other side of the story yet. The 
Hranth kept to themselves and had 
little to do with the newly-arrived 
Earthmen, but perhaps their ver- 
sion of how the Trazzidovh had 



come to share their village would be 
substantially different. 

T WAS. 

Three Hranth showed up at the 
Terran camp late that afternoon, 
and they had plenty they wanted to 
say. 

The hot young sun had started to 
drop toward the horizon, and the 
largest of the three pale moons of 
Hranth was dimly visible above, 
when the delegation arrived. 

There was no need for the pon- 
derous assistance of the O’Neill 
translator this time. Mary Dela- 
corte of the linguistics team had 
picked up an adequate working 
knowledge of the Hranth tongue 
with almost frightening speed, and 
she served as interpreter. The 
Hranth trio stood patiently before 
Lenoir’s desk, not speaking, merely 
staring at him placidly like three 
unusual trees rooted to the floor. 

Finally Lenoir said, “Well? Why 
have you come to see me?” 
Through the medium of Mary 
Delacorte the tallest of the trio re- 
sponded, “We have learned that 
you wish to hire the Trazzidovh.” 
“That’s right. I told Dulizd to 
invite your people to work for us 
too, if you want to. Building a 
colony is a big job. We can use 
help.” 

The alien’s lips curled unhap- 
pily. “We do not want to work for 
strangers. We are a free people.” 
“Sure you are,” Lenoir agreed. 
“Didn’t Dulizd make it clear that 



40 



IF 




we’d pay? We don’t mean to make 
you slaves!” 

The alien bent his arms back, ex- 
tending his elbows in what Lenoir 
had learned was the equivalent of a 
negative shake of the head. “The 
question of pay does not enter into 
it. To work for another tribe is to 
become a slave. The Trazzidovh are 
accustomed to slavery, but we of 
the Hranth are a free people.” 
“Hold it,” Lenoir objected. 
“Why do you say the Trazzidovh 
are accustomed to slavery?” 

“They have been slaves for cen- 
turies. Ever since they came creep- 
ing to us, shattered, desperately 
seeking refuge.” 

“They said you invited them to 
come.” 

“This is the lie they tell. We al- 
lowed them to come to us, but we 
never wanted them. They live 
among us, but they are an inferior 
people, worthy only of eating refuse 
and living in the ravines.” 

Lenoir folded his arms. “Perhaps 
this is so, perhaps not. But you still 
haven’t answered my first question: 
why have you come here today?” 
“To ask you not to employ the 
Trazzidovh.” 

“Why? What business is it of 
yours?” 

“They might develop Earthman 
ways. They cannot be trusted to live 
like civilized beings. You might 
give them weapons to destroy us.” 
Passing smilingly over the impli- 
cations of the accusation, Lenoir 
said, “We’re not here to give wea- 



pons to anybody. We just want to 
build a colony.” 

“Do not build it with the aid of 
the Trazzidovh,” came the stub- 
born reply. 

“I don’t plan to get mixed up in a 
private feud,” Lenoir said. “But 
right now I don’t see any reason 
why we shouldn’t hire them, and so 
we will.” 

“We will prevent it.” 

Lenoir didn’t like the tone of 
that. “How will you — ah — prevent 
it?” 

“We will pray to the Moon-God 
that your colony is a failure,” said 
the Hranth spokesman haughtily. 
“You have been warned. Now we 
shall go.” 

So they’ll pray to the Moon-God, 
Lenoir thought when the alien dele- 
gation had made its dignified exit. 
Well, well, well I hope we don ’t all 
wither up and die. 

To Mary Delacorte he said, 
“Thanks for the services, honey. Be 
a good girl and have a transcript of 
the conversation whipped up for my 
records, will you?” 

“Right away. Commander.” 

He smiled at her and stepped to 
the front door. Men in shorts and 
deep coats of tan were busily 
hammering away, building the 
colony. He had seen this so many 
times before, on a dozen worlds 
scattered through the galaxy, as 
Man staked his claim further and 
further out from the mother world. 

The Hranth, he thought, were 
going to pray to their Moon-God. If 



HOUSE DIVIDED 



41 




that were the worst problem this 
colony had to face, everything was 
going to turn out all right. 

He wondered briefly if it were 
really wise to get involved in native 
frictions. Probably not; but it was 
handy to have a labor force avail- 
able, and furthermore he suspected 
that the Trazzidovh had been 
getting a raw deal. Perhaps things 
could be altered a little in the next 
few months. After all, the settlers 
were going to spend the rest of their 
lives living next door to the aliens. 

N ot much after dawn the next 
morning Lenoir woke to dis- 
cover that the compound was bulg- 
ing with aliens. He dressed hur- 
riedly and went out to investigate. 

The linguistics team was there al- 
ready. Lieutenant Becker said 
sleepily, “They got here half an 
hour ago. Must have started out in 
the middle of the night. We 
counted a hundred sixty of them.” 
“All Trazzidovh?’’ 

Becker nodded. “All of them 
jabbering away in their language 
and Hranth, interchangeably. I’ve 
been talking to them in Hranth, 
and they say they all want to work. 
The whole tribe’s here except for 
the babies, the very old, and three 
or four girls who stayed behind to 
take care of them.’’ 

Lenoir proceeded to put the 
aliens to work. He relayed his 
orders to them via Mary Delacorte 
and Becker, who addressed them in 
Hranth after first explaining that 



the Earthmen had not yet had time 
to learn the Trazzidovh language. 

The Trazzidovh^worked well. 
They were eager people, go-getters, 
people with drive and push and in- 
genuity. By the end of the first day, 
seeing them working side-by-side 
with the colonists, Lenoir’s liking 
for them had ripened into a 
genuine admiration. 

They were good people to work 
with — cooperative, attentive, ener- 
getic. They had all the best quali- 
ties of Terrans — they were, per- 
haps, the most Earthlike alien race 
Lenoir had ever encountered. They 
formed a sharp contrast with the 
Hranth. 

How sharp a contrast it was be- 
came apparent during the next 
several weeks. Intrigued by the in- 
teresting tribal relationship, Lenoir 
sent a team of his anthropologists 
to make detailed investigations of 
the single village inhabited by two 
tribes. 

They reported that the Hranth 
were a lazy people, content to ac- 
cept the flow of events as they were, 
without rising to change the course 
of their lives. When the drought 
came, they suffered; when the 
storms came, they suffered. In both 
cases they prayed endlessly, calling 
on some mystic deity dwelling sim- 
ultaneously in each of the three 
moons to help them. 

The Trazzidovh, on the other 
hand, had built irrigation canals 
and contoured farms — but the land 
given them by their hostile cousins 



42 



IF 




was so infertile that even with all 
their ingenuity they had not been 
able to increase their numbers. 
Two hundred of them had fled 
across the plains, centuries before, 
and two hundred they still num- 
bered. 

The two tribes lived together in a 
state of chilly aloofness. The 
Hranth regarded their neighbors as 
vastly inferior; the Trazzidovh, 
suffering silently, privately had 
contempt for their flabby-willed 
cousins, but because they were out- 
numbered twenty-five to one they 
accepted their lot stoically — until 
they learned of the Earthmen and 
saw in them a chance to climb up- 
ward once again. 

Day after day Lenoir studied the 
reports. The Hranth had begun a 
marathon religious dance. Round 
the clock they beat drums and 
chanted and prayed for the swift 
doom of the Earthmen but other- 
wise made no attempt to interfere 
with the activities of the growing 
colony. 

The Hranth danced and prayed. 
The Trazzidovh, having already 
prayed and finished praying, were 
taking action. Day after day the 
colony expanded. The Earthmen 
were picking up smatterings of the 
Trazzidovh language. 

And the Trazzidovh were learn- 
ing English. 

Already bilingual, having been 
forced by circumstance to learn 
Hranth and being impelled by 
pride to retain their own language

as well, the Trazzidovh found little 
difficulty in learning yet another 
language. 

They fattened and grew pros- 
perous, and the Hranth continued 
to pray. The one-time ragpickers, 
the hapless refugees of the barren 
ravine, were thriving, thanks to 
their association with the Earth- 
men. 

And still the Moon-God stayed 
his hand. Lenoir often wondered 
how much strain their faith in the 
Moon-God was going to take. 

I N TIME Lenoir left the planet they 
had called Hranth, and moved 
on, leaving behind a fairly well es- 
tablished young colony. The 
schedule called for Lenoir and his 
men to pick up another group of 
colonists and settle them on the 
fourth planet of Gamma Crucis. 
After that there were other jobs to 
do and others beyond those. 

Eleven years slipped by, and Le- 
noir found himself within five light- 
years of the Gamma Trianguli 
Australis system, where once he 
had helped to plant a world. He 
was on his way back to Earth for his 
once-in-a-decade vacation; just out 
of curiosity he stopped off at 
Gamma Trianguli Australis VII, 
labeled Hranth on his star-charts. 

The colonial military authority 
gave him landing coordinates and 
he put his small ship down at the 
spaceport. He was met by several 
members of the original colonial 
group, who welcomed him enthu- 



siastically and conveyed him to 
town. 

And town it was. Lenoir saw a 
small city, of perhaps ten thousand 
souls, neatly laid out in a long strip. 
Powerlines glinted in the sunlight. 

“You’ve built this place up 
well,” Lenoir said. 

“We’ve been busy, Comman- 
der,” said David Revere, who had 
been a skinny teenager eleven years 
before and who now held a high 
post on the colonial council. Lenoir 
recognized other faces — Mary Dela- 
corte, Grace Walton, Klaus Mar- 
shall, others. 

Mary said to him, “Commander, 
there’s someone here we want you 
to meet.” 

Lenoir turned to find himself fac- 
ing an alien — a familiar-looking 
one. He was elderly, but well fed 
and sleek-looking, and he wore 
Earth-type clothing. 

“Hello, Commander,” the alien 
said in clear English. “I’m Tom 
Dulizd.” 

Lenoir groped in his memory. 
There had been so many worlds, so 
many names to remember — 

The alien said, “Remember me 
at all? I was the first Trazzidovh to 
visit you, and you spoke to me with 
the translating machine.” 

Lenoir remembered. “But you 
were a bony little emaciated fellow 
then! And what’s this Tom busi- 
ness?” 

The alien smiled cheerfully. “We 
all call ourselves by Earthman 
names now. It’s simpler that way.”

IF 




Lenoir felt a vast sense of uneasi- 
ness. He said to Mary Delacorte, 
“It’s coming back to. me now. 
Eleven years, you know — it’s hard 
to sort out everything that happen- 
ed on every planet. But I recall that 
there were two tribes of aliens living 
in a single village — ” 

She nodded. “That’s right. And 
Tom’s tribe came to work for us. 
We taught them our ways. Most of 
the Trazzidovh live right here in the 
city. Tom runs a food shop.’’ 
Lenoir shook his head slowly. 
“Incredible! Total assimilation so 
soon? And what about the other 
tribe — the — the Hranth?’’ 

Dulizd chuckled. “They’ve as- 
similated too — most of them. I 
employ two of them as my assis- 
tants in the shop. You know them, 
Mary — Mark and John.’’ 

Lenoir blinked. “I thought they 
were going to dance forever. The 
Moon-God was going to smite the 
colony, they said.’’ 

“Oh, they danced a while,’’ 
Dulizd told him. “Most of them 
gave up after six months or so, 
when they saw us getting rich. They 
began to figure out that maybe the 
Moon-God wasn’t going to help 
them, so they ought to see if the 
Earthmen had any jobs for them.’’ 
“And did they?’’ 

“Sure. Oh — ’’ Dulizd suddenly 
whipped out a large pocket-watch 
and stared at it. The sight of the big 
gold watch in those seven bony 
alien fingers struck Lenoir as gro- 
tesque, but he made no comment.

He was too dazed by the conse- 
quences of the movement he had 
begun so long before. 

Dulizd said, “Will you come with 
me to my store? I promise you a 
very interesting sight.’’ 

They drove — the settlers had be- 
gun manufacturing vehicles by 
now — down well-paved streets into 
a bustling business district. Dulizd 
parked outside a shining neon- 
fronted store and pointed down the 
street. 

“Here they come now,’’ he said. 
“The diehards.’’ 

Lenoir followed the pointing 
arm. The sound of drums and 
shaken gourds reached him — and, 
squinting, he could make out a 
startling sight. A dozen or so with- 
ered old aliens in tattered robes 
were advancing through the busy 
streets, beating drums, dancing, 
singing. 

“What are they?’’ Lenoir asked. 

Dulizd smiled expansively. “The 
last of the Old Guard. The eleven 
unassimilated Hranth.’’ 

“You mean the moon-dance is 
still going on?’’ Lenoir asked in- 
credulously. 

“Yes. After eleven years,’’ said 
Dulizd. “They haven’t given up 
praying for our destruction. But the 
rest of the Hranth won’t have any- 
thing to do with them — so they 
come here every day and I give 
them food.’’ 

“You what?” 

“Of course,’’ said the Trazzidovh 
in a bland tone. “I believe in pre- 



serving the ancient institutions, you 
see. These old men have ration- 
alized my daily gift into some kind 
of peace-offering I make to them, 
or else they’d never accept it.’’ 

Lenoir moistened his lips and 
looked around, at the handsome 
colony, at the busy streets, at the 
prosperous-looking alien next to 
him, at the weird procession of 
cursing ancients that was now only 
a block away. 

All this in eleven years! Lenoir 
smiled. The coming of the Terrans 
had upset a state of affairs that had 
existed for centuries, jolting the 
Hranth out of their complacency 
and providing the Trazzidovh with 
the opportunity they deserved. The 
house was no longer divided — ex- 
cept for the eleven bony anachron- 
isms advancing up the streets, and 
they would soon be only memories. 

Dulizd opened the shop-door; 
Lenoir saw two younger aliens with- 
in, also in Terran-style clothes. 
Dulizd said, “The dinosaurs are 
coming! Get the food ready for 
them.’’ He chuclded and remarked, 
to Lenoir, “You know. Comman- 
der, after all this time those old 
boys are still sticking to the story 
that they never invited our ances- 
tors to come fight for them and so 
weren’t obliged to give them a 
decent place to live when they did 
come. And yet I feed them at my 
own expense every day.’’ He smiled 
broadly and said, “It’s lucky for 
them that I’m not a vindictive 
man.’’ •

BERSERKER'S PLANET 



For half a millennium the 
disembodied killer-machine 
had been haunted by the 




49 




radio into the Orion s lounge, and 
the six people gathered there, the 
only people alive within several 
hundred light years, were listening 
attentively for the moment, some of 
them only because Oscar Schoen- 
berg, who owned Orion and was 
driving her on this trip, had indi- 
cated that he wanted to listen. 
Carlos Suomi, wha was ready to 
stand up to Schoenberg and ex- 
pected to have a serious argument 
with him one of these days, was in 
this instance in perfect agreement 
with him. Athena Poulson, the in- 
dependent one of the three women, 
had made no objection; Celeste 
Servetus, perhaps the least inde- 
pendent, had made a few but they 
meant nothing. Gustavus De La 
Torre and Barbara Hurtado had 
never, in Suomi’s experience, ob- 
jected to any decision made by 
Schoenberg. 

The dead man’s voice to which 
they listened was not recorded, only 
mummified by the approximately 
five hundred years of spacetime 
that stretched between Hunters’ 
system, where the radio signal had 
been generated, and Orion's pres- 
ent position in intragalactic space 
about eleven hundred light years 
(or five and a half weeks by ship) 
from Earth. It was the voice of 
Johann Karlsen, who about five 
hundred standard years ago had 
led a battle fleet to Hunters’ system 
to skirmish there with a berserker 
fleet and drive them off. That was 
some time after he had smashed the 



main berserker power and per- 
manently crippled their offensive 
capabilities at the dark nebula 
called the Stone Place. 

Most of the bulkhead space in 
the lounge was occupied by view- 
screens, and then, as now, they 
were adjusted for the purpose, the 
screens brought in the stars with 
awesome realism. Sumoi was look- 
ing in the proper direction on the 
screen, but from this distance of 
five hundred light years it was 
barely possible without using tele- 
scopic magnification to pick out 
Hunters’ sun, let alone to see the 
comparatively minor flares of the 
space battle Karlsen had been 
fighting when he spoke the words 
now coming into the space yacht’s 
lounge for Schoenberg to brood 
over and Suomi to record. Briefly 
the two men looked somewhat 
alike, though Suomi was smaller, 
probably much younger, and had a 
rather boyish face. 

f ow can you be sure that’s 

jTXKarlsen’s voice?” Gus De 
La Torre, a lean and dark and 
somehow dangerous-looking man, 
asked now. He and Schoenberg 
were sitting in soft massive chairs 
facing each other across the small 
diameters of the lounge. The other 
four had positioned their similar 
chairs so that the group made an 
approximate circle. 

“I’ve heard it before. This same 
sequence.” Schoenberg’s voice was 
rather soft for such a big, tough- 



50 



IF 




looking man, but it was as decisive 
as usual. His gaze, like Suomi’s, 
was on the viewscreen, probing out 
among the stars as he listened in- 
tently to Karlsen. “On my last trip 
to Hunters’,’’ Schoenberg went on 
softly, “about fifteen standard years 
ago, I stopped in this region — fif- 
teen lights closer-in, of course — 
and managed to find this same sig- 
nal. I listened to these same words 
and recorded some of them, just as 
Carlos is doing now.’’ He nodded in 
Suomi’s direction. 

Karlsen broke a crackling radio 
silence to say: “Check the lands on 
that hatch if it won’t seal — should I 
have to tell you that?’’ The voice 
was biting, and there was some- 
thing unforgettable about it even 
when the words it uttered were only 
peevish scraps of jargon indistin- 
guishable from those spoken by the 
commander of any other difficult 
and dangerous operation. 

“Listen to him,’’ Schoenberg 
said. “If that’s not Karlsen, who 
could it be? Anyway, when I got 
back to Earth after the last trip I 
checked what I had recorded 
against historians’ records made on 
his flagship, and confirmed it was 
the same sequence.’’ 

De La Torre made a playful tut- 
tutting sound. “Oscar, did nobody 
ask you how you came by your re- 
cording? You weren’t supposed to 
be out in this region of space then, 
were you, any more than we are 
now?’’ 

“Pah. Nobody pays that much 



attention. Interstellar Authority 
certainly doesn’t.’’ 

Suomi haji the impression that 
Schoenberg and De La Torre had 
not known each other very long or 
very well, but had met in some 
business connection and had fallen 
in together because of a common 
interest in hunting, something that 
few people now shared. Few people 
on Earth, at least, which was the 
home planet of everyone aboard the 
ship. 

Karlsen said: “This is the High 
Commander speaking. Ring three 
uncover. Boarding parties, start 
your action sequence.’’ 

“Signal hasn’t decayed much 
since I heard it last,’’ Schoenberg 
mused. “The next fifteen lights 
toward Hunters’ must be clean.’’ 
Without moving from his chair he 
dialed a three-dimensional holo- 
graphic astrogation chart into exis- 
tence and with his lightwriter deftly 
added a symbol to it. The degree of 
clean emptiness of the space be- 
tween them and their destination 
was of importance because, al- 
though a starship’s faster-than- 
light translation took place outside 
of normal space, conditions in ad- 
jacent realms of normal space had 
their inescapable effects. 

“There’ll be a good gravitational 
hill to get up,’’ said Karlsen on the 
radio. “Let’s stay alert.’’ 

“Frankly, all this bores me,’’ 
said Celeste Servetus (full figure. 
Oriental and black and some strain 
of Ndrdic in her ancestry, incredibly

smooth taut skin beneath her silver 
body paint, wig of what looked like 
silver mist). Here lately it was Ce- 
leste’s way to display flashes of 
insolence toward Schoenberg,' to go 
through periods of playing what in 
ah earlier age would have been 
described as hard-to-get. Schoen- 
berg did not bother to look at her 
now. She had already been got. , 

“We wouldn’t be here now, 
probably, if it weren’t for that 
gentleman who’s talking on the 
radio.’’ This was Barbara Hurtado. 
Barbara and Celeste were much 
alike, both playgirls brought along 
on this expedition as items for male 
consumption, like the beer and the 
cigars; and they were much differ- 
ent, too. Barbara, a Caucasian- 
looking brunette, was as usual 
opaquely clothed from knees to 
shoulders, and there was nothing 
ethereal about her. If you saw her 
inert, asleep, face immobile, and 
did not hear her voice or her laugh, 
or behold the grace with which she 
moved, you might well think her 
nothing beyond the ordinary in 
sexual attractiveness. 

Alive and in motion, she was as 
eye-catching as Celeste. They were 
about on a par intellectually, too, 
Suomi had decided. Barbara’s re- 
mark implying that present-day in- 
terstellar human civilization owed 
its existence to Karlsen and his 
victories over the berserkers was a 
truism, not susceptible of debate or 
even worthy of reply. 

The berserkers, automated war- 



ships of terrible power and effec- 
tiveness, had been loosed on the 
galaxy during some unknown war 
fought by races long vanished 
before human history began. The 
basic program built into all ber- 
serkers was to seek out and destroy 
life, whenever and wherever they 
found it. In the dark centuries of 
their first assaults on Earth-des- 
cended man, they had come near 
overwhelming his modest dominion 
among the stars. Though Karlsen 
and others had turned them back, 
forced them away from the center 
of human-dominated space, there 
were still berserkers in existence 
and men still fought and died 
against them on the frontiers of 
man’s little corner of the galaxy. 
Not around here, though. Not for 
five hundred years. 

“I admit his voice does some- 
thing to me,’’ Celeste said, shifting 
her position in her chair, stretching 
and then curling her long naked 
silver legs. 

“He loses his temper in a minute 
here,’’ said Schoenberg. 

“And why shouldn’t he? I think 
men of genius have that right.’’ 
This was Athena Poulson in her 
fine contralto. Despite her name, 
her face showed mainly Oriental 
ancestry. She was better looking 
than nine out of ten young women, 
carrying to the first decimal place 
what Celeste brought to the third. 
Athena was now wearing a simple 
one-piece suit, not much different 
from what she usually wore in the 



52 



IF 




office. She was one of Schoenberg’s 
most private and trusted secre- 
taries. 

Suomi, wanting to make sure he 
caught Karlsen’s temper-losing on 
his recording, checked the little 
crystal cube resting on the flat arm 
of his chair. He had adjusted it to 
screen out conversation in the 
lounge and pick up only what came 
in by radio. He reminded himself to 
label the cube as soon as he got it 
back to his stateroom; generally he 
forgot. 



ow they must have hated 
XXhim,” said Barbara Hur- 
tado, her voice now dreamy and far 
away. 

Athena looked over. “Who? The 
people he lost his temper at?’’ 

“No, those hideous machines he 
fought against. Oscar, you’ve 
studied it all. Tell us something 
about it.’’ 

Schoenberg shrugged. He seemed 
reluctant to talk very much on the 
subject although it obviously inter- 
ested him. “I’d say Karlsen was a 
real man, and 1 wish 1 could have 
known him. Carlos here has per- 
haps studied the period more thor- 
oughly than I have.’’ 

“Tell us, Carl,’’ Athena said. 
She was sitting two chairs away. 
Suomi’s field was the psychology of 
environmental design. He had been 
called in, some months ago, to 
consult with Schoenberg and Asso- 
ciates on the plans for a difficult 



new office, and there he had met 
Athena ... so now he was here, on 
a big-game hunting expedition, of 
all things. 

“Yes, now’s your chance,’’ De La 
Torre put in. Things did not 
generally go quite smoothly be- 
tween him and Suomi, though the 
abrasion had not yet been bad 
enough to open up an acknowledg- 
ed quarrel. 

“Well,” said Suomi thoughtfully, 
“in a way, you know, those ma- 
chines did hate him.’’ 

“Oh no,’’ said Athena positively, 
shaking her head. “Not machines.’’ 

Sometimes he felt like hitting 
her. 

He went on: “Karlsen is sup- 
posed to have had some knack of 
choosing strategy they couldn’t 
cope with, some quality of leader- 
ship . whatever he had, the ber- 
serkers couldn’t seem to oppose 
him successfully. They’re said to 
have placed a higher value on his 
destruction than on that of some 
entire planets.’’ 

“The berserkers made special as- 
sassin machines,’’ Schoenberg of- 
fered unexpectedly. “Just to get 
Karlsen.’’ 

“Are you sure of that?’’ Suomi 
asked, interested. “I’ve run into 
hints of something like that, but 
couldn’t find it definitely stated 
anywhere.’’ 

. “Oh, yes.’’ Schoenberg smiled 
faintly. “If you’re trying to study 
the matter you can’t just ask Info- 
center on Earth for a printout; you 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



53 




have to get out and dig a little more 
than that.” 

“Why?” Infocenter, as a rule, 
could promptly reproduce anything 
that was available as reference ma- 
terial anywhere on Earth. 

“There are still some old govern- 
ment censor-blocks in their data 
banks holding information on ber- 
serkers.” 

Suomi shook his head. “Why in 
the world?” 

“Just official inertia, I suppose. 
Nobody wants to take the time and 
trouble to dig them out. If you 
mean why were the censor-blocks 
inserted in the first place, well, it 
was because at one time there were 
some people who worshipped the 
damned things; berserkers, I 
mean.” 

“That’s hard to believe,” Celeste 
objected. She tried to say more but 
was interrupted by Karlsen shout- 
ing in anger, chewing out his men 
about something unintelligibly 
technological. 

“That’s about the end,’’ said 
Schoenberg, reaching for a control 
beside his chair. The frying crackle 
of radio static died away. “There’re 
several hours of radio silence fol- 
lowing.” Schoenberg’s eyes went 
shifting restlessly now to his astro- 
gational chart. “So there was some 
dimwitted bureaucratic policy of 
restricting information about ber- 
serkers . the whole thing is fas- 
cinating, ladies and gents, but what 
say we move on toward our hunt- 
ing?” 



W ITHOUT pretense of waiting 
for agreement he began to set 
his astrogalional and drive com- 
puters to take them on toward 
Hunters’. It would be another 
seventeen or eighteen standard days 
before Orion arrived in-system 
there. Exact timing was not pos- 
sible in interstellar travel. It was 
something like piloting a sailing 
ship in a sea full of variable cur- 
rents, depending upon winds that 
were undependable from day to day 
even though they held to a fairly 
consistent pattern. Variable stars, 
pulsars, spinars and quasars within 
the galaxy and out of it had each 
their effects upon the subfounda- 
tion of space through which the 
starship moved. Black holes of 
various sizes committed their 
wrenching gravitational enormities 
upon the fabric of the Universe. 
The explosions of supernovae far 
and near sent semi-eternal shock 
waves lapping at the hull. The 
interstellar ship that effectively out- 
paces light does not, cannot, carry 
aboard itself all the power needed 
to make it move as it does move. 
Only tapping the gravitational-in- 
ertial resources of the universe can 
provide such power, as the winds 
were tapped to drive the sailing 
ships of old. 

Though the artificial gravity 
maintained its calm dominion in 
the lounge a change in lighting of 
the holographic chart signalled that 
Orion was underway. Schoenberg 
stood up, and stretched expansive- 



54 



IF 




ly, seeming to grow even bigger 
than he was. “On to Hunters’ I” he 
announced. “Who’ll join me in a 
drink? To the success of the hunt, 
and the enjoyment of any other 
amusements we may run into.’’ 

They all would have a drink. But 
Athena took only a sip before 
dropping her glass away into the re- 
cycling station. “Shall we get our 
chess tournament moving again, 
Oscar?’’ 

“I think not.’’ Schoenberg stood 
with one hand behind his back 
under the short tails of his lounging 
jacket, almost posing, savoring his 
own drink. “I’m going below. Time 
we got the firing range set up and 
got in a little practice. We’re not 
going after pheasant, exactly . 
we’ll have enough of tournaments 
after we land, perhaps.’’ His intelli- 
gent eyes, lighted now by some pri- 
vate amusement, skipped around 
at all of them, seemed to linger 
longest, by a fraction of a second, 
on Suomi. Then Schoenberg turned 
and with a little wave went out of 
the lounge. 

The party broke up. After taking 
his recorder back to his stateroom, 
Suomi started out again to see what 
the firing range was going to be 
like, and ran into De La Torre in 
the passageway. 

Suomi asked: “What was that all 
about, ‘enough of tournaments 
after we land’?’’ 

“He’s told you nothing about the 
tournament he wants to watch?’’ 

“No. What kind?’’ 



De La Torre smiled, and would 
not or could not give him a straight 
answer. 

II 

I N THE camp by the placid river, 
under Godsmountain’s wooded 
flanks, there were sixty-four war- 
riors when all were assembled at 
last, on this warm morning in the 
eastern-sunrise season. Out of the 
sixty-four there were not more than 
four or five who had ever seen each 
other before because they had come 
each from his own district, town, 
fiefdom, nomadic band or island, 
from every corner of the inhabitable 
world. Some had journeyed here 
from the shores of the boundless 
eastern ocean. Others had come 
from the edge of permanently in- 
habited territory to the north, 
where spring, already a sixtieth-of- 
an-old-man’s-lifetime old, was 
melting free the glacier-beast and 
rime- worm. From the north came 
the mightiest hunters of this world 
named for hunting. Others of these 
warriors had come from the uncros- 
sable shattered desert that lay to 
the west of the lands of men, and 
others still from the tangle of rivers 
and swamps in the south that 
blended finally into ocean again 
and blocked all travel in that direc- 
tion. 

The warriors who had gathered 
on this day for the beginning of 
Thorun’s Tournament were vari- 
ously tall or short, lean or heavy.

but only a few were very young 
men, and none at all were very old. 
All were notably violent men even 
on this world of violence, but 
during the days of assembly they 
had camped here together in peace, 
each on his arrival accepting with- 
out argument whatever little plot of 
campground was assigned him by 
Leros or one of the subordinate 
priests of Thorun. In the center of 
the camp an image of the god, 
dark-bearded and gold -diademed, 
brooding with hand on sword-hilt, 
had been erected on a field-altar, a 
small wooden platform, and no 
warrior failed to place some offer- 
ing before it. Some of the offerings 
were rich, for some of the men who 
had come to fight in the Tourna- 
ment were wealthy. 

However wealthy or powerful an 
entrant might be, he came alone, 
unattended by any servants or well- 
wishers and carrying little more 
than a heavy robe for shelter in 
addition to the weapons of his pref- 
erence. It was going to be a holy 
tournament, regarded by the priests 
of Thorun as so sacred that outside 
spectators were barred — though 
there was scarcely a freeman on the 
planet who did not yearn to watch. 
Nor were outside servants needed. 
The assembled warriors and priests 
were to be served — luxuriously, it 
appeared — by an almost equal 
number of gray-clad male slaves 
whose dress marked them as prop- 
erty of Godsmountain, of Thorun 
and his servitors. No women were 



to be allowed within the camp. 

On this morning when the last 
warrior arrived, some slaves were 
making ready the flat fighting 
arena of pounded earth, some ten 
paces in diameter. Other slaves 
prepared a midday meal and set 
aside offerings of fruit and meat for 
those who would wish to lay- them 
on Thorun’s altar. The smoke of 
the cooking fires rose into a sky 
that was quite clear and had some- 
thing of the blueness of Earth’s sky, 
and yet also something of yellow- 
ness and bitterness and brass. 

From beyond the plumes of 
smoke the mountain looked down, 
an unfamiliar sight to almost all of 
those who had come here to fight. 
But it had been known since child- 
hood in all their hearts and minds. 
On its top the priests of Thorun 
dwelt, and their god and his power 
with them, within the white walls of 
his sacred city. Women and ani- 
mals and other prosaic necessities 
were up there too; slaves were taken 
up from time to time as needed to 
serve the dwellers but seldom or 
never did the slaves come down 
again; those at work this morning 
in the riparian meadow had all 
been imported for the occasion 
from tributary lands. Godsmoun- 
tain’s sizable armies never, except 
for select detachments, marched 
any nearer their own capital than 
the mountain’s base. To most ordi- 
nary folk the summit and its 
citadel-city were unattainable. 

Thorun himself dwelt there, and 



56 



IF 




the demigod Mjollnir, his most 
faithful paladin. Other divinities 
visited from time to time: the gods 
of healing, justice, soil and weath- 
er, and growth and fecundity; and 
numerous demigods with ancillary 
responsibilities. But it was pri- 
marily Thorun’s mountain, Tho- 
run’s religion, Thorun’s world — ex- 
cept to those, generally restricted to 
the rim of the world these days, 
who did not like Thorun, or did not 
like the power wielded in his name 
by Godsmountain’s priests. Hunt- 
ers’ was a planet of hunters and 
warriors, and Thorun was god of 
war and of the hunt. 

A priest called Leros, of middle 
age, having seen three previous 
northern springs, and scarred by 
the violence of his youth, had been 
appointed by the High Priest 
Andreas to direct the Tournament. 
Leros was high in rank among the 
priests of Thorun, though not a 
member of the most secret Inner 
Circle. In his youth he had gained 
an almost legendary reputation as a 
fighter, and many of the best of 
these young heroes regarded him 
with awe. Leros came down to the 
riverb^nk himself to greet the last- 
arriving warrior, one Chapmut of 
Rillijax. He gave Chapmut a hand 
out of his canoe, badeliim welcome 
to the Sacred Tournament of Tho- 
run, and then with a small flourish 
placed the last check-mark on the 
tally sheet containing all the ex- 
pected warriors’ names. 

Shortly after, a solemn drum 



called all of them to an assembly. 
Leros, standing in a new robe of 
spotless white in the center of the 
clean new arena, waited while fhey 
gathered around its edge. They 
were not long in falling silent to 
give him their full attention. In 
some parts of the circle the warriors 
were crowded, yet there was no 
jostling or edging for position 
among them, or anything but the 
greatest courtesy. 

44 ■fjEJOicE, ye chosen of the 
Jvgods!” Leros cried out at last 
in his still-strong voice. He swept 
his gaze fully around the ring of 
fighting men, standing himself as 
tall and strong as most of them, 
though no longer as quick or sure. 
It was many days, about a sixtieth- 
part-of-an-old-man’s-life, since the 
formal announcement of this Tour- 
nament had been carried down 
from Godsmountain and spread 
across the world. For much longer, 
since the time of the last northern 
spring, it had been common knowl- 
edge that this Tournament was 
coming. Scrawny little boys of that 
time were now men in their prime; 
and Godsmountain and all its do- 
ings had waxed greatly in impor- 
tance since then. 

Many of the waiting entrants 
were half naked in the mild weath- 
er, their bodies all muscles and 
scars and hair. The clothes of some 
were very rough, and those of 
others soft and rich. A few wore 
scraps of body armor, or carried 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



57 




shields of hardened sloth-leather or 
bright iron. Full armor was un- 
known on Hunters'^ where a man 
stood on his feet to fight and never 
rode. These fighters were chiefs’ 
sons and peasants’ sons and sons of 
unknown* fathers. Nothing but 
merit, merit with sword and spear 
and battle-axe, had won them their 
places here. Around him now Leros 
saw blue eyes and dark eyes, eyes 
with epicaiithic folds and eyes 
without, deep eyes here, mad eyes 
there, and a pair or two of eyes that 
seemed as innocent as babes’. The 
original colonists from Earth, some 
six standard centuries in the past, 
had been eclectically selected from 
a world already well mixed in race 
and culture. Around Leros the 
faces were brown or white or black, 
with hair of black or brown or 
yellow or red — there was one iron- 
gray^, two shaven bald. Here was a 
heavily tattooed face, with stripes 
across from ear to ear, and over 
there a smile showed teeth all filed 
to points. More numerous than the 
oddities were other men who looked 
as prosaic as herdsmen, save for the 
weapons at their belts. Besides 
their human maleness, only one 
thing was common to them all: un- 
common skill at killing other men 
in single combat. 

44'nEJOicE, ye chosen!” Leros 
J^alled again, more softly. 
“Before the sun goes down upon 
this day, half of you will stand with- 
in our god’s great hall — ” he 



pointed toward Godsmountain’s 
top, out of sight behind the wooded 
bulges of its lower slopes — “and 
face to face with Thorun himself.” 
Leros prepared himself to retell, 
and his listeners made ready to 
hear yet again, the promises that 
had been carried down from Gods- 
mountain a standard year earlier by 
Leros and his aides. 

Thorun, warrior-chieftain of the 
gods (so the message went) had 
been pleased by the spirit shown by 
the race of men in the recent series 
of wars extending Godsmountain’s 
power across most of the habitable 
world. The god was pleased to 
grant to humankind the privilege of 
fighting for a seat at his right hand, 
the competition being open to the 
sixty-four finest heroes of the age. 
To accomplish this purpose the in- 
habited world had been arbitrarily 
divided into sixty-four districts, 
and the local rulers of every district 
were invited to send — the details of 
the selection process being left 
largely to them — their mightiest 
warrior. All but one of the con- 
testants was expected to die in the 
Tournament of Thorun, and that 
one, the winner, would be granted 
the status of a demigod and would 
take his seat at Thorun’s right 
hand. (Out in the country some- 
where, some irreverent logician 
would be sure to ask the priest who 
brought the message: How about 
Mjollnir: Will he have to move 
down a peg? Not at all, my nephew. 
No doubt he and the Tournament 



58 



IF 




winner will share the honor of being 
next to Thorun. No doubt they will 
fight for the day’s turn whenever it 
pleases them.) 

By all reports it pleased them to 
fight a lot in Thorun’s hall atop the 
mountain. There the great god and 
the more or less deified men, 
slaughtered heroes of wars and 
combats past, re-slaughtered one 
another daily for the joy of it and 
were miraculously healed of their 
wounds each evening in time to en- 
joy the perfect meat and drink of 
.Thorun’s table, the tale-telling of 
immortal eloquence shared by the 
company of the gods, the endless 
supply of maidens eternally made 
virgin for their pleasure. (Out in 
the country, the questioner relaxes 
with a sigh; there is more here than 
a simple warrior knows how to 
argue about. Even if he is not so 
simple, the questioner sees that he 
is not going to beat this talking 
priest at his own game of words.) 

Leros on this bright morning was 
formally spelling out once more 
what his listeners already knew: 
“Those of you who fall in the first 
round of fighting will be the first to 
feast with Thorun — but eternally 
around the lowest portion of his 
table. The next sixteen who perish, 
in the second round of fighting, will 
be granted places higher up. In the 
fighting of the third round eight 
will die and will be seated higher 
still — and each of these will have 
eternally with him four lovely maids 
of a beauty surpassing any in this 



world, two of ivory white and two of 
ebon black, to satisfy his every wish 
even before it can be spoken aloud. 

“After the fourth round has been 
fought there will be only four 
warriors left alive, the strongest of 
the strong. The four who die in the 
fourth round of fighting will be 
granted shields and arms lustrous 
as silver, yet harder and keener 
than the finest steel, and wine gob- 
lets to match, and each will have 
eight virgin maidens of still greater 
beauty perpetually in his service. 
They will be seated very near to 
Thorun. 

“In the fifth round of duels, two 
more men must fall, and these two 
will be seated in tall chairs of oak 
and gold, higher up the table still, 
and they will be granted gold wine- 
cups and shields and arms, and 
each will be served by sixteen maids 
of beauty indescribable, and all 
things will be theirs in fuller meas- 
ure than any lower men may have. 
On that day but two of you will re- 
maia alive outside the hall where 
the gods feast. 

“The single duel of the sixth 
round of fighting will be the last 
and greatest. Who loses it will still 
be honored beyond any of those 
that I have mentioned yet. And 
when it is over, the Tournament 
will be over, and one man will have 
won. That man alone shall walk, in 
the flesh, into the holy place of the 
god Thorun, and his place for all 
time to come shall be at Thorun’s 
right hand; and from his high place 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



59 




that man will overtop all of the 
other sixty-three by as great a mea- 
sure as they stand above the race of 
puny, mortal men that crawl about 
here below.” 

Leros concluded with a sigh. He 
believed the promises and they 
moved him to envy and awe every 
time he thought about them. 



F or some time now one of the 
warriors, black of skin and 
huge, had been leaning forward 
with an expectant look, as if he 
wished to speak. Now Leros, with 
an inquiring glance, took notice of 
him. 

The man asked: ‘‘Lord Leros, 
tell me this — ” 

‘‘Address me no more as Lord. 
Your status from this day forward 
is higher than my own.” 

‘‘Very well. Friend Leros, then. 
Tell me this: when a man has won 
this. Tournament will he then have 
all the powers and rights that gods 
are known to have? I mean not only 
powers of war, but of the soft and 
healing arts?” 

Leros had to take thought for a 
moment or two before answering. It 
had not been one of the usual ex- 
pectable questions, for instance 
was Thorun’s hall threatened by 
overcrowding with all the wars, or 
what kind of sacrificial meat would 
the god prefer today. At last he 
spoke. ‘‘The gentle goddess of heal- 
ing will certainly listen to any 
request that man may make.” He 



let out a light sigh. ‘‘The gods listen 
to one another more than they do to 
men. But then they still do what 
they please, unless of course they 
have bound themselves by formal 
promise, as Thorun has done re- 
garding this Tournament.” 

The man nodded soberly. ‘‘It is 
all we can expect,” he said, and re- 
sumed his place in the circle. 

All were silent now. Somewhere 
in the background a slave was 
chopping kindling for the first 
funeral pyre. Leros said: ‘‘Then go, 
all of you, and make what final 
preparations you will. The first 
fight will begin shortly.” 

As soon as the assembly had dis- 
persed a subordinate priest drew 
Leros aside and when they had 
reached a place of relative privacy 
unrolled a small scroll and showed 
it to him. ‘‘Lord Leros, this was 
found posted on a tree not far 
away. We have no clue as yet to 
indicate who put it up.” 

The lettering on the scroll seem- 
ed to have been made with a dull 
ordinary pencil of charred kett- 
wood. The message read: 

Gods and men, place your bets. 
Who of the 64 will be proven the 
greatest fighter? That one will 
be, there is no doubt. Will he 
then envy those that he has slain, 
and curse Godsmountain and its 
lying priests? While your money 
is out, try to lay a bet on this al- 
so: Are the rulers of this moun- 
tain fit to rule our world? 

The Brotherhood 



60 



IF 




I EROS nodded, tight-lipped, at 
j the signature. “You have sent 
word of this up the hill?” 

“Of course. Lord.” 

“That is all we can do for the mo- 
ment. We must make sure the army 
increases its patrols in the area.” 
But of course the message might 
have been put up by someone 
known to be in the area of the 
Tournament. Perhaps one of the 
slaves — or even one of the contes- 
tants — is not what he pretends to 
be. “We must keep our eyes open, 
of course, and let nothing jeopar- 
dize the Tournament. To discredit 
it would be a considerable victory 
for the Brotherhood.” The Brother- 
hood was a vague league of the dis- 
affected, probably including most 
of Godsmountain’s enemies, who 
were now scattered and relatively 
powerless around the rim of the 
inhabited world. There might be a 
sharp and dangerous secret organi- 
zation at its core; it seemed wise to 
assume there was, and to continu- 
ally warn the people and the 
soldiers of it. 

The subordinate indicated his 
agreement and withdrew. Leros 
pondered briefly: Might the agent 
who had left the message be a dis- 
loyal priest? He did not think it 
probable. But he could not be 
completely sure. 

The Tournament, meanwhile, 
had to get started. There had been 
no sign from up the hill that High 
Priest Andreas or any of his Inner 
Circle were coming down to watch. 



A pack train came into view on the 
lower reaches of the long road that 
wound its way down the forested 
slopes from the summit; but when 
it drew near Leros saw that no men 
of rank were walking near the ani- 
mals, it was only a regular supply 
caravan returning unburdened 
from the top. 

On with it, then. Turning to a 
waiting herald, he gave the signal 
for the battle-horn to be blown, to 
call the contestants all together for 
the last time in the world of living 
men. When they were assembled he 
drew from a pocket of his fine white 
robe a scroll of new vellum, on 
which a priest-scribe had set down 
the names in elegant calligraphy. 
They appeared in the alphabetical 
order hallowed by time and military 
usage: 

Arthur of Chesspa

W HEN he had done with read- 
ing, Leros glanced up at the 
still-high sun. “There will be time 
today for much fighting. Let it be- 
gin. 

He handed the scroll to a sub- 
ordinate priest, who read in a loud 
voice: “Arthur of Chesspa — Ben 
Tarras of the Battle-Axe.” 

Having both stepped into the 
ring, and made their holy signs 
imploring Thorun’s favor, the two 
went at it. Ben Tarras had taken 
only a dozen more breaths when his 
battle-axe spun out of his hand to 
bury itself with a soft sound in the 
calmly receiving earth, while Ar- 
thur’s swordblade at the same time 
sank true and deep in Ben Tarras’s 
flesh. The bare, flattened soil of the 
fighting ring drank Ben Tarras’s 
blood as if it had been long athirst. 
A pair of slaves in shabby gray 
tunics dragged his body from the 
ring, toward a place nearby where 
other slaves were readying a pyre. 
The dry wood was stacked twice 
taller than a man already, and was 
not yet enough. Thirty-two men to- 
day would join the gods and begin 
their eternal feast with Thorun. 

“Big Left Hand — Bram the 
Beardless of Consiglor.” 

This fight went on a little longer; 
and then both hands of Big Left 
Hand (they appeared equally big) 
were stilled as Bram’s sword tore 
his middle open. Again the slaves 
came to bear a corpse away, but 
Big Left Hand stirred and kicked 
feebly as they took him up. His eyes 



opened and were living, though the 
terrible wound in his front was 
plainly mortal. One slave, who 
limped about his work, pulled from 
his belt a short but massive leaden 
maul and broke the head of the 
dying man with a short methodical 
swing. Leros for the second time 
said ritual words to speed a loser’s 
soul to Thorun, nodded to the 
acolyte who held the scroll. 

“Brunn of Bourzoe — Byram of 
the Long Bridges.” 

It went on through the after- 
noon, with little pauses between 
fights. Some of the fights were 
long, and one of the winners had 
lost so much blood that he could 
hardly stand himself before he 
managed to still the breath in the 
loser’s throat. As soon as each fight 
was over the slaves came quickly to 
stanch the wounds, if any, of the 
winner, and lead him to food and 
drink and rest. It was likely to go 
hard in the second round of fight- 
ing with those who had been weak- 
ened in the first. 

The sun was reddening near the 
horizon before the last match had 
been fought. Before retiring, Leros 
gave orders that the camp should 
be moved early in the morning. 
Originally he had planned to wait 
until midday before beginning the 
slow intended progress up the 
mountain, but the smoke of the 
funeral pyre seemed to lie heavy 
here in the low air, and amphibious 
vermin from the river were being 
drawn to the camp by the blood of 



BERSERKER’S PLANET

heroes in which the earth was 
soaked. 



Ill 

O rion was well in-system now, 
rapidly matching orbital veloc- 
ities with Hunters’ planet, and in 
fact not far from entering atmos- 
phere. From his command chair in 
the small control room at the center 
of the ship, Schoenberg supervised 
his autopilot with a computer-pre- 
sented hologram of the planet drift- 
ing before him, the planet as it ap- 
peared in gestalt via the multitude 
of sensing instruments built into 
the starship’s outer hull. 

A few days earlier Suomi had ob- 
tained a printout on Hunters’ 
planet from the ship’s gazeteer, a 
standard databank carried for 
navigation, trade, and emergency 
survival. The Hunterian year was 
about fifteen times as long as the 
Earth-standard year; Hunters’ 
planet was therefore much farther 
from its primary than Earth was 
from Sol, but Hunters’ Star was a 
blue-white subgiant, so that the 
total insolation received by both 
planets was very nearly equal. The 
radius, mass, and gravity of 
Hunters’ planet were Earthlike, as 
was the composition of the atmos- 
phere. Hunters’ would surely have 
been colonized from pole to pole 
had it not been for its extreme axial 
tilt — more than eighty degrees to 
the plane of its revolution around 



Hunters’ sun, almost as far as was 
Uranus in its orbit around Sol. 

Spring was now a standard year 
old in the Hunterian northern 
hemisphere, which region was 
therefore emerging from a night 
that had been virtually total for an- 
other Earthly year or so. Near the 
north pole the night had now lasted 
for more than five standard years 
and would endure for a total of 
seven. Up there the ice-grip of the 
dark cold was deep indeed, but it 
would soon be loosened. Seven 
standard years of continuous sun- 
heat were coming. 

According to statements in the 
gazeteer, which were probably still 
valid though more than a standard 
century old, men had never manag- 
ed to settle permanently much far- 
ther than fifteen degrees of latitude 
in either direction from the Hun- 
terian equator. Dome colonies 
would have been called for and 
there had never been sufficient 
population pressure to make it 
worthwhile. Indeed, the population 
had not occupied even the whole 
equatorial zone of the main con- 
tinent when the berserkers came. 
When the killing machines from 
out of space attacked, the growing 
technological civilization of Hun- 
ters’ colonists had been wrecked; 
the intervention of Karlsen’s battle 
fleet was the only reason that any of 
the colonists — or the biosphere it- 
self, for that matter — had survived 
at all. The native life, though none 
of its, forms were intelligent, did 



64 



IF 




manage to endure at all latitudes, 
surviving the long winters by hiber- 
nation of one kind or another, and 
in many cases getting through the 
scorching, dessicated summers by 
an estivation cycle. 

Away from the tropics, spring 
presented the only opportunity for 
feeding, growth, and reproduction. 
Because the southern hemisphere 
was so largely water, the northern 
spring was the one that counted 
insofar as land animals were con- 
cerned. In the northern springtime 
beasts of all description emerged 
from caves and nests and frozen 
burrdws with the melting of the ice. 
Among them came predators, more 
terrible, burning with more urgent 
hunger and ferocity, than any 
creatures that had ever4ived on the 
old wild lands of Earth. On Hunt- 
ers’ planet now, as every fifteen 
standard years, the hunting season 
by which the planet had acquired 
its name was in full swing. 



poaching season, I sup- 
M, pose we should call it,” said 
Carlos Suomi to Athena Poulson. 
The two of them were standing in 
the shooting gallery Schoenberg 
had set up a few weeks earlier in the 
large cabin directly beneath Orion's 
lounge. Suomi and Athena were 
looking over a large gun rack filled 
with energy rifles; Schoenberg had 
enjoined everyone aboard to select 
a weapon and become adept with it 
before shooting in earnest was re- 



quired. Schoenberg and De La 
Torre spent a good deal of time 
down here. Celeste and Barbara 
hardly any. 

Suomi and Athena were inter- 
mediate, he generally showing up 
whenever she went to practice. 
They were in mid-session now. 
Some ten meters from the rifle 
rack — half the diameter of the 
spherical ship — a computer-design- 
ed hologram showed a handful of 
Hunterian predators stop-actioned 
in what looked like a good drawing 
of their natural habitat. Around 
and beyond the sketch-like animals 
in the middle distance what ap- 
peared to be several square kilo- 
meters of glacier spread to an 
illusive horizon. 

‘‘All right,” Athena said in her 
low voice. ‘‘Technically speaking, 
this trip is outside interstellar law. 
But it’s evident that neither the 
authorities on Earth or the Inter- 
stellar Authority care very much. 
Oscar is too smart to get into any 
real trouble over such a thing. 
Relax and enjoy the trip, Carl, now 
that you’re here. Whyever did you 
come along if you don’t like the 
idea?” 

‘‘You know why 1 came.” Suomi 
pulled a rifle halfway out of the 
rack and then slid it back. The end 
of its muzzle was slightly bulbous, 
dull gray, pitted all over with tiny 
and precisely machined cavities. 
What it projected was sheer physi- 
cal force, abstracted almost to the 
point of turning into mathematics. 



BERSERKER’S PLANET

Suomi had already tried out all the 
rifles in the rack and they all 
seemed pretty much the same to 
him, despite their considerable dif- 
ferences in length and shape and 
weight. They were all loaded now 
with special target cartridges, pro- 
jecting only a trickle of power when 
triggered, enough to operate the 
target range. Its setup was not dif- 
ferent in principle from the target 
ranges in arcades on Earth or other 
urbanized planets; only there it was 
generally toy berserkers that one 
shot at, black metal goblins of 
various angular shapes that waved 
their limbs or flashed their imita- 
tion laser beams in menace. “I’ve 
always enjoyed these target games,’’ 
he said. “Why shouldn’t these be 
real enough, instead of going after 
living animals?’’ 

“Because these are not real,’’ 
said Athena firmly. “And shooting 
at them isn’t real either.’’ She chose 
a rifle and turned her back on 
Suomi to aim it down the range. 
Somewhere a scanner interpreted 
her posture as that of the ready 
hunter, and the scene before her 
came alive again with deliberate 
motion. A multmouthed creature 
bristling with heavy fur stalked 
toward them at a range of seventy 
meters. Athena fired, a small click 
was emitted by the rifle, which re- 
mained perfectly steady, and the 
beast flopped over in a graceful, 
almost stylized way, now wearing a 
spot of red light riveted near the 
middle of what should have been its 



spine. The indication was for a 
clean kill. 

“Athena, I came along because 
you were coming, and I wanted to 
spend time with you, to get some 
things settled between us. That’s 
why I had you get me invited. Also 
it was a chance to take a trip bn a 
private space yacht, something I’ll 
probably never be able to do again. 
If I must hunt, to keep your lord 
and master upstairs happy, why 
then I’ll do it. Or at least go 
through the motions of hunting.’’ 

“Carlos, you’re always talking 
down Oscar to me, and it won’t 
work. I think this is the one I’ll 
carry.’’ She turned the rifle this way 
and that, looking at it critically. 

“I wonder what the people living 
on Hunters’ think about expedi- 
tions like ours.’’ 

“They’re not being harmed, as 
far as I can see. I don’t suppose 
they’ll give a damn, even if they 
know we’re there, which they prob- 
ably won’t. We won’t be hunting in 
an inhabited area, but in the 
north.’’ 

She sounded as if she knew what 
she was talking about, though she 
had probably only read the same 
ship’s printout that Suomi had 
been studying. None of them except 
Schoenberg had been here before, 
and, when you thought about it, 
Schoenberg was really uncommuni- 
cative about his previous trip. With 
a few words he gave assurance that 
they were all in for some marvelous 
sport, warned succinctly about cer- 



66 



IF 




tain dangers to be wary of — and 
that was about it. He might have 
been on Hunters’ a number of 
times before. He might be three 
hundred years old or more; it was 
getting hard to tell these days, 
when an age of five hundred years 
was not unheard of. As long as the 
central nervous system held out 
other systems of the body could 
generally be maintained or replaced 
as needed. 

Schoenberg’s voice now sounded 
on the intercom. “We’re coming 
into atmosphere soon, people. Arti- 
ficial gravity will be going off in an- 
other twenty minutes. Better secure 
your areas and settle in the lounge 
or in your staterooms.’’ 

“We hear you in the target 
range,’’ Suomi answered. “We’re 
on our way.’’ He and Athena began 
to secure the rifles in the rack, and 
to make sure that nothing in the 
area was likely to fly around loose if 
the coming maneuvers in free 
gravity should become violent for 
any reason. 

S EATED a few minutes later in 
the lounge, Suomi watched the 
progress of their descent on the 
wall-sized screens. The planet, that 
had been hardly more than a star 
when last he observed its image, 
was now on top of them, or so it 
seemed. It grew further, eased 
around to a position below them as 
Schoenberg changed ship’s atti- 
tude, spread a cloud net to catch 



Orion, became a world with a hori- 
zon to hold them in. The blue-white 
sun grew yellowish as they began to 
see it from inside the planet’s at- 
mosphere. 

The land below was high, rough 
country. Like most planets. Hunt- 
ers’ had an uninhabited look when 
seen from the upper air. Here the 
appearance persisted even when 
they had dropped to only a few kilo- 
meters’ altitude. 

Schoenberg, alone in the control 
room, now took over control com- 
pletely from the computers, guiding 
the ship manually, looking rapidly 
from one television screen to an- 
other. In the lounge they could 
watch him on the passenger’s 
screen. Obviously traffic in the 
Hunterian atmosphere was practi- 
cally non-existent and a mid-air 
collision nothing to be feared. 

Now Schoenberg was following a 
river, actually skirting sometimes 
between the walls of its deep-cut 
canyon. Mountains rose and dipped 
beneath Orion as he veered away 
from the watercourse, steadily de- 
creasing speed. At last a chalet-like 
structure, flanked by log outbuild- 
ings, the whole complex surround- 
ed by a palisade, came into view at 
the head of a pass. There was a 
scarcity of level ground, but 
Schoenberg had no real trouble in 
lowering the ship onto the barren 
soil about fifty meters outside the 
stockade. From the spherical metal 
hull, thick landing struts moved 
out to take the ship’s weight and 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



67 




hold her upright. There was a 
scarcely perceptible settling motion 
when the pilot cut the drive. The 
ship used the same silent forces for 
maneuvering in atmosphere as in 
space — ^though caution was neces- 
sary when using them near a planet- 
sized mass — and it could be landed 
on any surface that would bear its 
weight. 

Obviously their descent had been 
observed, for the drive was hardly 
off before people in drab clothes 
began to appear from a gate in the 
stockade. The arrival of a space- 
ship seemed to be an exciting event, 
but no more than that. The im- 
promptu welcoming committee of 
six or eight showed no hesitancy in 
drawing near. 

Once the ship was firmly down 
Schoenberg got out of his chair and 
headed for the main hatch, which, 
without formality, he at once open- 
ed wide to the planet’s air, and 
pressed the button to extrude a 
landing ramp. He and the others 
aboard had taken the routine im- 
munological treatments before de- 
parture, and the ship had been 
gone over by his own medics to 
avoid carrying dangerous micro- 
organisms to a planet with only a 
primitive medical technology. 

The natives waited a few meters 
from the ship, the women wearing 
long gowns and heavy aprons, the 
men for the n>ost part dressed in 
coveralls. A couple of them had 
primitive cutting or digging tools in 
hand. 



O NE smiling young man, better 
dressed than the others, his 
boots just as heavy but fancier, and 
with a short sword in a decorated 
leather scabbard at his belt, stepped 
forward. 

“Welcome, then.” He spoke the 
common language with what seem- 
ed to Earth ears a heavy, but under- 
standable, accent. “Now you are 
Mister Schoenberg, I recall.” 

“I am.” Smiling and open in his 
manner, Schoenberg went down 
the ramp to shake hands. “And you 
are — Kestand, isn’t it? Mikenas’s 
younger brother?” 

“Now that is right. I was just a 
small one last hunting season when 
you were here. Surprised you know 
me.” 

“Not at all. How’s Mikenas?” 
“He’s fine. Out now tending 
stock.” 

The conversation went on about 
the state of affairs on the ranch or 
fiefdom or whatever it was that the 
absent Mikenas owned or ruled. 
Suomi and the other passengers — 
all the girls were now dressed quite 
modestly — had come down from 
the lounge, but at a gesture from 
Schoenberg remained just inside 
the ship, enjoying the fresh alien 
air. Meanwhile the farm workers 
remained standing in a group out- 
side. These all appeared cheerful 
and more or less healthy, but might 
have been deaf and dumb. It was 
probably a decade and a half since 
any of them had had any news from 
the great interstellar civilization 



68 



IF 




that networked the sky about them. 
They smiled at the visitors, but only 
Kestand spoke, and even he showed 
no inclination to ask how things 
were going, out among the stars. 

It seemed that no introductions 
were going to be made. The whole 
thing had a clandestine air, like a 
smugglers’ meeting. For a moment 
Suomi wondered — but the idea was 
ridiculous. A man of Schoenberg’s 
wealth would not dabble in smug- 
gling so directly if he decided to 
take it up. 

Kestand was asking: “Have you 
been hunting yet?’’ 

“No. I wanted to stop here first, 
and find out what’s changed on the 
world since my last trip.’’ 

“Well.’’ Kestand, not the most 
scintillating speaker Suomi had 
ever attended, began to expand his 
earlier reports on the local state of 
crops and weather and hunting. 
“Not real northern hunting, y’und- 
erstand, I haven’t been able to get 
away yet this season. Like to be 
on my way right now, but Mikenas 
left me in charge.’’ 

Schoenberg was listening pa- 
tiently. Suomi, from clues dropped 
here and there, gathered that Mi- 
kenas and Schoenberg had gone 
north by spaceship last hunting sea- 
son and had enjoyed notable suc- 
cess. Suomi’s eyes kept coming 
back to the sword Kestand wore. 
The sheath was leather, looped 
onto the man’s belt, and the hilt 
seemed to be plastic but of course 
was much more likely to be wood or 



bone; Suomi wished he knew more 
about primitive materials. Casting 
back through his life’s memories — 
only about thirty years to be sure — 
he could not recall ever before see- 
ing a man carrying a weapon for 
any non-symbolic purpose. Of 
course this sword might be only a 
badge of authority. It looked, 
though, as business-like as the hoe 
that one of the other men was hold- 
ing. 

The two-way conversation had 
veered to the governmental and re- 
ligious changes that had taken 
place since the last northern hunt- 
ing season. These were all obscure 
to Suomi, but Schoenberg seemed 
to understand. 



ODSMOUNTAiN has pretty well 
^\Jtaken over, then,’’ he mused, 
nodding his head as if at a sus- 
picion confirmed. Then he asked: 
“Are they having the Tournament 
as planned this season?’’ 

“Yes.’’ Kestand looked up at the 
sun. “Should be starting in another 
two, three days. Byram of the Long 
Bridges, he’s our local champion.’’ 
“Local?’’ Schoenberg looked 
thoughtful. “Isn’t Long Bridges a 
good two hundred kilometers from 
here?’’ 

“I tell you, this’s a world Tourna- 
ment. Each of the sixty-four dis- 
tricts is a big’un.” Kestand shook 
his head. “I’d purely like to go.’’ 
“You would’ve gone, I bet, even 
rather than hunting, if Mikenas 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



69 




hadn’t left you in charge here.” 

“No, oh nooo, there was no way. 
Tournament’s private for the gods 
and priests. Even the earl couldn’t 
get an invitation, and Byram in his 
bodyguard. Mikenas didn’t even 
try.’’ 

Schoenberg frowned slightly, but 
did not pursue the matter of the 
Tournament any further. Suomi 
meanwhile was imagining a tourna- 
ment of jousting, as in the old 
stories of Earth, men in full armor 
hurtling together on armored ani- 
mals, trying to unseat each other 
with lances. But it couldn’t be quite 
that; he recalled from his reading 
that there were no riding animals 
on Hunters’. 

After a little more talk Schoen- 
berg thanked his informant cour-^ 
teously and called up into the ship 
for them to hand him down a 
satchel from a locker near the 
hatch. “And two of those ingots 
that you’ll find in the locker; bring 
them down also, would you, gentle- 
men?’’ 

Suomi and De La Torre brought 
the desired items down the ramp. 
Setting the satchel at Kestand’s 
feet, Schoenberg announced: “This 
is what I told Mikenas I’d bring 
him, power cells for lamps and a 
few medicines. Tell him I’m sorry I 
missed him; I’ll stop again next 
season if all goes well. And here.’’ 
He hefted the two ingots and 
handed them to the native. “For 
you. Good metal for points or 
blades. Have a good smith work it. 



Tell him to quench it in ice water. I 
guess you have no trouble getting 
that at this altitude.’’ 

“Why, I give you great thanks!’’ 
Kestand was obviously well pleased. 

Once the ramp was retracted and 
the hatch closed, Schoenberg wast- 
ed little time in getting Orion into 
the air again. He still held manual 
control, soaring up in a steep arc 
that gradually bent into a level 
flight toward the northwest. 

His passengers had come to the 
control room with him this time 
and sat or stood around, more or 
less looking over his shoulder. 
When they had leveled off, De La 
Torre asked: “Where to, fearless 
leader? Shall we go and watch a few 
heads get broken?” 

Schoenberg grunted. “Let’s go 
hunting first, Gus. The man said 
two or three days before the Tour- 
nament starts. I’m anxious to get a 
little hunting in.” This time he re- 
membered to look around as a 
matter of form. “How does that 
suit you people?” 

The planet flowed south and east 
beneath them. The sun, turning 
blue-white again at this altitude, 
reversed its apparent daily motion 
proper for the season and also slid 
toward the east from the tearing 
high-Mach velocity of their flight. 
An indicator on the edge of a warn- 
ing zone showed how the drive was 
laboring to move them at so high a 
velocity this close to the center of a 
planet-sized mass. Schoenberg was 
indeed impatient. He had run out 



70 



IF 




force-baffles on the hull, Suomi 
noted, to dampen the sonic shock 
wave of their passage, and they 
were too high to be seen from the 
ground with unaided eyes. No one 
in the lands below would be able to 
detect their passage. 

Celeste and Barbara soon retired 
to redecorate themselves in inter- 
stellar style. For the next several 
days the party would presumably 
be out of sight of Hunterian males 
who might be aroused or scandal- 
ized by the fashions of the great 
world. 

Athena, clinging to a stanchion 
behind Schoenberg’s chair, re- 
marked: “I wonder if there are 
other hunting parties here. Out- 
worlders like us, I mean.” 

Schoenberg only shrugged. 
Suomi said: ‘‘I suppose there might 
be three or four. Not many can 
afford private space travel, and also 
have the inclination to hunt.” 

De La Torre: ‘‘Since we all seem 
to have the inclination to hunt, it’s 
lucky for us that we found Oscar.” 
Oscar had no comment. Suomi 
asked De La Torre: ‘‘Do you work 
for him, by the way? You’ve never 
told me.” 

‘‘I have independent means, as 
they say. We met through business, 
about a year ago.” 

Schoenberg had gone a little 
higher to ease the strain on the 
drive. At this altitude the world 
called Hunters’ almost seemed to 
have let go of the ship again. On 
several of the wall screens the ter- 



minator, boundary line between 
night and day, could be seen slant- 
ing across cloud cover athwart the 
invisible equator far to the south. 
The south pole, well out of sight 
around the curvature of the world, 
was more than halfway through its 
approximately seven standard years 
of uninterrupted sunlight. There 
the sun was a standard year past its 
closest approach to the zenith, and 
was now spiralling lower and ever 
lower in the sky, one turn with 
every Hunterian day, or one about 
every twenty standard hours. 

A couple of standard years in the 
future the sun would set for its long 
night at the south pole and simul- 
taneously rise above the horizon at 
the north pole. Right now the Hun- 
terian arctic, locked in the last half 
of its long night, must look as life- 
less as the surface of Pluto, buried 
under a vast freeze-out of a sub- 
stantial portion of the planet’s 
water. Up there the equinoctial 
dawn would bring the hunting 
season to its end; right now the sea- 
son was at its height in the middle 
latitudes of the north, where the 
sun was just coming over the hori- 
zon, each day sweeping from east to 
west a little higher in the southern 
sky, bringing in the thaw. That 
region must be Schoenberg’s desti- 
nation. 



T hey came down into a world of 
icy twilight, amid slopes of 
bare enduring rock and eroding, 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



71 




fantastic glaciers, all towering 
above valleys filled with rushing 
water and greenly exploding life. 

Schoenberg found a walkable 
part of the landscape in which to 
set Orion down and some solid level 
rock to bear her weight. This time, 
before opening the hatch, he took a 
rifle from the small rack set just 
inside, and held it ready in his 
hands. The opening of the hatch 
admitted a steady polyphonic roar 
of rushing waters. Schoenberg drew 
a deep breath and stood in the 
opening, looking out. As on the 
earlier landing the others were be- 
hind him. Celeste and Barbara, not 
dressed for near-freezing weather, 
moved shivering to the rear. The air 
smelled of wetness and cold, of 
thawing time and alien life. The 
landscape stretched before them, 
too big and complex to be quickly 
taken in. The shadows of southern 
mountains reached up high on the 
mountains to the north. 

They were going out right away; 
there were several standard hours 
of daylight remaining here. Schoen- 
berg began a routine check-out of 
arms and other equipment, and 
called for volunteers. 

Athena announced at once that 
she was ready. De La Torre said 
that he would like to have a go. 
Suomi, too — not that he really in- 
tended to kill anything that did not 
attack him. He felt a genuine need 
to get out of the ship for a while. 
Though all the tricks of environ- 
mental psychology had been used 



in the interior design of the Orion 
to ameliorate the reality of confine- 
ment, the trip had still cooped up 
six people in a small space for many 
weeks. Being aware of all the de- 
signer’s tricks, Suomi was perhaps 
helped less than others by them. 
Barbara and Celeste elected not to 
try hunting today after Schoenberg 
had indicated he preferred it that 
way. He promised them a more 
peaceful picnic outing in the morn- 
ing. 

“We’ll go in pairs, then,’’ 
Schoenberg announced when every- 
thing was ready. “Gus, you’ve 
hunted before, but not on this 
planet. If I may suggest, you and 
Athena take a stroll down the valley 
there.” It spread before them as 
they looked out from the hatch, be- 
ginning thirty or forty meters from 
the rocky level where the ship 
rested, plunging after about a kilo- 
meter and a half of gentle, green- 
clad slope into an ice-clogged can- 
yon down whose center a new tor- 
rent had begun to carve its way. 
“Down there at the lower end, 
where it slopes off into the canyon, 
the vegetation may well be head- 
high. There should be twelve or 
thirteen species of large herbi- 
vores.” 

‘Tn that little space?” De La 
Torre interrupted. 

‘Tn that little space.” Now that 
he was going hunting, Schoenberg 
sounded more relaxed and happy 
than at any time on the trip before. 
‘‘Life doesn’t just thaw out here in 



72 



IF 




the spring — it explodes. There’ll be 
large predators in that valley too, or 
I miss my guess. You don’t want to 
run into one an arm’s length away, 
so better skirt the taller growth. 
Carlos and I are going to take the 
upper path.” This climbed a rocky 
slope on the other side of the ship. 
Suomi, during their descent, had 
glimpsed higher meadows in that 
direction. ‘‘We may find something 
really hungry up there, just out of a 
high cave and on its way down into 
the valleys for its first meal in a year 
or two.” 

Boots, warm clothing, weapons, 
communicators, a few emergency 
items — all in order. Suomi was the 
last to get down the ramp and 
crunch his new boots on Hunterian 
soil. Almost before his feet were off 
the ramp it began to fold up and 
retract. If the playgirls stayed in- 
side with the hatch closed they 
would be perfectly safe until the 
men returned. 

Athena and Gus waved and set 
off on the lower way, tendrils of 
grass-like groundcover whipping 
about their boots. ‘‘Lead on up the 
path,” said Schoenberg, with an 
uphill gesture to Suomi. ‘‘I’m sure 
your nerves are okay — ^just a matter 
of principle that I don’t like a 
novice hunter with a loaded firearm 
walking behind me, when some- 
thing to shoot af may jump out 
ahead.” The voice was charming if 
the words were not, and they were 
said with a happy and friendly 
look. All was right with Schoenberg 



at the moment, obviously; he was 
eager to get going. 

There was not really a path to 
follow, of course, but Suomi moved 
on up the spine of hill that formed 
the natural route Schoenberg must 
have meant to indicate. 

S UOMI as he climbed was soon 
lost in admiration of the coun- 
try around him. Wherever the melt- 
ing away of the winter’s ice had left 
a few square centimeters of soil ex- 
posed, rank vegetation had sprung 
up. There were no tree-sized plants 
in evidence, nothing that seemed to 
have begun to grow more than a 
few, days or weeks ago. In most 
places the grass- and vine-like 
things were no more than waist 
high, but frequently they grew so 
thickly that no glimpse of soil could 
be seen between the stems. The 
plants were striving madly, ruth- 
lessly, for water and warmth and 
sunlight, leaping into growth, mak- 
ing what they could of the wet 
season before the long searing 
drought of summer began. 

He paused, coming in sight of a 
meadow where man-sized creatures 
like giant slugs were moving, vora- 
ciously feeding on the plants, the 
wrinkles visibly stretching out of 
their grayish, hairless bodies. 

‘‘Rime- worms,” said Schoen- 
berg, who came up close behind 
him and disregarded the creatures 
after the first glance. ‘‘Look sharp 
now, there may be something after 
them.” 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



73 




“Do any of the larger forms 
freeze solidly through the night?” 

‘‘Biologists Fve talked to say it’s 
not possible. But I don’t think any- 
one knows for sure.” Now that they 
had stopped, Schoenberg was 
studying the country with binocu- 
lars. They had put a little rocky 
bulge of hill between themselves 
and the spaceship, and were now 
out of sight and sound of anything 
manmade save what they carried 
with them. The tracks they had left 
behind them in occasional patches 
of slush or muddy turf were the 
only signs of past human activity. 
The world around them had been 
made virgin by death and resurrec- 
tion. 

Suomi was studying the country 
too, but not with binoculars and 
not for game. The yellowed sun was 
skimming a low point in the moun- 
tainous horizon, and seemed on the 
point of setting; actually there must 
still be an hour or so of daylight 
left. On the other side of a wide 
valley a glacier groaned, shed a few 
tons of cornice, broke out with a 
clear new waterfall. The organ- 
notes of older cataracts held steady 
in the distance. Gradually, as 
Suomi began to comprehend the 
scene fully, as he got beyond the 
stage of simple elation at getting 
outdoors again, he realized that he 
had never before beheld a scene of 
nature so beautiful and awesome, 
nothing that even came close. Not 
even the wonders and terrors of 
space, which, when they could be 



perceived at all, were beyond the 
scale and grasp of human apprecia- 
tion. This thundering world of 
mountains and valleys, with its ex- 
ploding life, was not beyond the 
human scale, not quite. 

Schoenberg was less content with 
what he saw. Of predators he had 
evidently discovered no sign. “Let’s 
move on a little,” he said tersely, 
putting his binoculars away. Suomi 
led on again. When they had gone a 
few hundred meters more, Schoen- 
berg called another halt, this time 
at the foot of a steep slope. 

After another short session with 
the binoculars, Schoenberg pointed 
up the hill and said: “I’m going up 
there and have a look around. Let 
me do this alone, I want to be quiet 
and inconspicuous about it. Stay 
here, don’t move around, keep your 
eyes open. There may be something 
on our trail, stalking us, and you 
may get a good shot just by wait- 
ing.” 

With a faint thrill of danger, 
small enough to be enjoyable, 
Suomi looked back along the way 
they had come. Nothing moved but 
the distant, harmless rime- worms. 
“All right.” 

He sat down and watched 
Schoenberg up the slope and out of 
sight over the top of it. He then 
swiveled around on his rocky seat, 
enjoying the absence of people in 
every direction. It was delightful to 
be alone, for the first time in — it 
seemed like the first time in his life. 
Isolation could be accomplished in 



74 



IF 




the ship, of course, but the others’ 
bodies and minds were always 
there, one was always aware of 
them only a few meters away. 
Suomi touched the communicator 
on his belt. The channels among 
hunters and between the hunters 
and the ship were alive but so far 
totally unused. Everyone was enjoy- 
ing the physical and psychic sepa- 
ration. 

Time passed. Schoenberg was 
gone longer than Suomi had ex- 
pected. A thin shadow came over 
the nearby scenery as the sun de- 
clined behind a distant rim of ice. 
Without preamble a magnificent 
glacier-beast appeared before 
Suomi’s eyes, perhaps two hundred 
fifty meters off, across a gentle 
slope of detritus fallen from an ex- 
tension of the slope at the foot of 
which Suomi waited. It was not the 
direction from which Schoenberg 
had thought a predator was likely 
to come, nor was the creature look- 
ing toward Suomi. It was facing 
downhill, turning its head back and 
forth. Suomi raised his binoculars, 
and recalled his reading. An excel- 
lent specimen, male, probably 
second-cycle, just awakened from 
the second hibernation of its life 
into its full prime of strength and 
ferocity. The hollowness of loins 
and ribs was visible despite the 
thickness of orange-yellow fur. It 
was rather larger than an Earthly 
tiger. 

Suomi, without getting to his 
feet, raised his rifle in perfectly 



steady hands and aimed. He was 
only playing. He lowered the 
weapon again. 

“Long shot for a beginner,’’ said 
Schoenberg’s voice from close be- 
hind him, a little way up the slope. 
The cataract-roar must swallow the 
voice before the beast could hear it, 
even as it had kept Suomi from 
hearing Schoenberg’s approach 
among the rocks. “But a clean one. 
If you don’t want to try it I’ll have a 
crack.’’ 

Suomi knew without turning that 
Schoenberg would already be rais- 
ing his rifle to take aim. Still with- 
out looking around, Suomi lifted 
his own weapon once more and 
fired (pop, a little louder than in 
the shooting gallery, and now at 
full power there was a perceptible 
kick), deliberately aiming ahead of 
the animal to frighten it away, 
blasting up a spray of ice. Catlike, 
the creature crouched, then turned 
toward the earthmen its alienly un- 
readable face. The men who lived 
on Hunters’ were men of Earth in 
their ancestry and distant history; it 
was easy to forget how alien all the 
other life-forms here must be. 



N ow THE glacier-beast was run- 
ning, crossing the slope in 
great graceful catlike bounds. But 
it was not fleeing from the men as it 
should, as Suomi had unthinkingly 
assumed it must. In pure innocence 
of the powers it faced it was coming 
now to kill and eat him. Insane 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



75 




hunger drove it on. Its sprinting 
taloned feet hurled up rocks from 
the talus slope, mixed with a 
powdering of snow. 

Shoot Whether Schoenberg was 
calling out the word, or he himself, 
or whether it only hung thought- 
projected in the freezing, timeless 
air, Suomi did not know. He knew 
only that death was coming for 
him, visible, and incarnate, and his 
hands were good for nothing but 
dealing out symbols, manipulating 
writing instruments, paintbrushes, 
electronic styluses, making an im- 
pression on the world at second or 
third remove, and his muscles were 
paralyzed now and he was going to 
die. He could not move against the 
mindless certainty he saw in the 
animal’s eyes, the certainty that he 
was meat. 

Schoenberg’s rifle sounded, a re- 
petitive, seemingly ineffectual 
popping not far from Suomi’s right 
ear. Invisible fists of god-like power 
slammed at the charging animal, 
met the beautiful energy of its 
charge with a greater, more brutal 
force. The force-blows tore out 
gobs of orange-yellow fur,, and dis- 
torted the shapes of muscle and 
bone beneath. The huge body shed 
its grace and its momentum. StilJ it 
seemed to be trying to reach the 
men. Now its body broke open 
along a line of penetration wounds, 
spilling out insides like some red- 
stuffed toy. Clear in Suomi’s vision 
was an open paw with knife-long 
claws, arching high on the end of a 



forelimb and then striking down 
into a puddle of slush not ten 
meters from his boots. 

When the beast was still, Schoen- 
berg put another shot carefully into 
the back of its head for good meas- 
ure, then slung his rifle and got out 
his hologram camera. Then, after 
looking at the gory, broken body 
from several angles, he shook his 
head and put the camera away 
again. He spoke reassuringly to 
Suomi, seeming not in the least 
surprised or upset by Suomi’s be- 
havior. He was offhandedly gra- 
cious when Suomi at last managed 
to stammer out a kind of thanks. 
And that in its way was the most 
contemptuous attitude that Schoen- 
berg coirld have taken. 



IV 

Early on the morning of the 
Tournament’s second day, Leros, 
the priest in charge, led the surviv- 
ing thirty-two contestants on an 
easy march of some five kilometers, 
up from the flat land by the river 
where the first round had been 
fought to a much higher meadow 
resting in Godsmountain’s lap. At 
this new site an advance party of 
priests and workers were already at 
work, preparing a new fighting ring 
of cleared, hard -trodden earth, and 
a new field altar for the image of 
Thorun that was brought up on a 
cart just in front of Leros and the 
warriors. The slave-laborers were 



76 



IF 




sweating, earning their rations to- 
day, for their numbers had been 
greatly reduced, many being sent to 
other projects. Only half the origi- 
nal number of warriors now requir- 
ed service, of course, and as always 
there was plenty of other labor to be 
performed in the citadel-city above 
and the tributary lands below. 

The plan of the Tournament, 
handed down to Leros by the High 
Priest Andreas and his Inner Circle 
of councillors, required that each 
successive round of fighting take 
place closer to the top of the moun- 
tain than the one before. The pur- 
pose, as Andreas had explained it, 
was symbolic. But Leros observed 
now that the plan had practical ad- 
vantages as well. The offal of each 
camp would be promptly left be- 
hind, the latrine, the leavings of the 
cook-tents, the remnants of the 
funeral pyre. 

The work of readying the new 
site was completed shortly after the 
fighting men arrived, and an acolyte 
handed over the day’s new vellum- 
written lists to Leros. He called the 
men into assembly, and, when 
some formalities had been gotten 
out of the way, read the lists out:

Vladerlin Bain of Sanfa Town 

Wull Narvaez 

Before giving the signal for the 
start of the second round’s first 
fight, Leros took a moment to look 
around him at his world. There was 
much in it to make him feel con- 
tent. From the high meadow where 
he stood the prospect was one of 
long reaches of cultivated land 
below, kilometer after kilometer of 
field and pasture, with here and 
there an orchard, a cluster of 
houses, a patch of raw forest or a 
string of trees along a watercourse. 
It was a peaceful and malleable 
world, one of peasants and crops 
and artisans, obediently serving the 
masters of violence who dwelt on 
the heights above. There was of 
course, the Brotherhood to flaw it. 
After yesterday’s posted insult no- 
things further had been heard from 
them . there was also, more 
naggingly, the fact that the Inner 
Circle seemed to be closed to Leros, 
and the office of High Priest, there- 
fore, forever unattainable. Why 
should a priest like Lachaise, for 
example, who was far more an arti- 
san than a fighting man, be a 
member of the Inner Circle, when 
Leros and others more deserving 
were kept out? 

At any rate the Tournament was 
going well. That was what mattered 
most. Perhaps if it was a great suc- 
cess he would at last be promoted — 
and there was no reason why it 
should not smoothly run its course. 



At the end of it the great gate of the 
city would open for the winner as 
the maidens strewed flowers before 
him and he was conducted in 
triumph through the streets to the 
Temple; and that would stand open 
for him also; and then the inner 
curtains of chain-mail would part — 
as they never had for Leros — and 
the secret doors, and the winner 
would be let in where Leros himself 
had never been to the place where 
gods walked with the fallen heroes 
who once were mortal men, where 
only the High Priest and the Inner 
Circle came to mediate between 
them and the world of men. 



I EROs’s religion was not simply a 
j matter of faith to him. He had 
once glimpsed Thorun in an inner 
courtyard of the Temple, standing 
taller than any mortal man, walk- 
ing with the High Priest on a night 
when storms were in the air and 
lightning flickered . 

He bowed his head for a moment 
of private prayer, then brought 
himself back to the waiting men, 
and his responsibilities, and called 
out the names for the first match of 
the day: 

“Arthur of Chesspa — Bram the 
Beardless of Consiglor.’’ 

Arthur was a middle-aged man 
of middle size. In this company of 
warriors he looked small. Stocky, 
dour- looking, heavily mustached, 
he strode into the ring with an air of 
utterly nerveless competence and 



78 



IF 




with unblinking calm watched 
Bram the Beardless approach with 
intent to kill. 

Bram, it appeared, was beardless 
by reason of his extreme youth. 
Though he was tall and heavy- 
shouldered his face looked no more 
than one Hunterian year of age, fif- 
teen or sixteen sixtieths-of-an-old- 
man’s-life. Bram was not calm but 
his excitement seemed to be rather 
joy than fright as he opened the 
attack with an exuberant swing of 
his fong sword. Arthur parried the 
blow well enough, seemed in no 
hurry to go on the offensive himself. 

Bram pressed the attack; his 
youth and energy did not admit the 
possibility that he could be beaten. 
Again and again he struck, while 
Arthur still retreated thoughtfully, 
seeming to await the perfect time to 
counter. And again and again 
Bram struck, with ever-increasing 
speed and terrible strength. Arthur 
still had not made up his mind how 
best to fight when there came a 
blow he could not stop. He lost an 
arm and shoulder. The finishing 
stroke came quickly. 

“Brunn of Bourzoe — Charles the 
Upright.” 

Brunn was heavyset and fair, 
with a sun-bleached look about 
him. In one thick hand he held a 
short spear in such fashion that it 
was evident he preferred to thrust 
rather than risk all on one throw. 
He took the initiative, though cau- 
tiously, moving slowly widdershins 
around the upright Charles. Charles 



gangly as a bird, looking as if he 
might be happier perching on one 
leg, stood tall and held his two- 
handed sword ready for whatever 
Brunn might do. The spear-thrust, 
when it came, was strong and quick 
but the response, of Charles was 
better; the lopped-off spearhead 
fell to earth. The fair head of 
Brunn was not far behind it. 

“Col Renba — Efim Samdevia- 
toff.” 

These two were similar in ap- 
pearance, both a little above middle 
height and with brown shaggy hair. 
Col Renba whirled a spike-studded 
ball on the end of a short chain 
attached to a wooden handle. Sam- 
deviatoff held sword and dagger 
ready. Both jumped to the attack at 
the same time but the spiked ball 
struck the sword out of the hand 
that held it and in the next breath 
dashed the brains that had directed 
it upon the ground. 

“Farley of Eikosk — Geoff Sym- 
bolor.” 

Again there was a resemblance; 
this time one of manners rather 
than appearance. Both contestants 
were well dressed and expensively 
armed. There were even jewels in 
the hilts of Geoffs sword and 
dagger. Farley was fair, almost red, 
of hair and beard. His bare arms, 
lined with bone and vein and 
muscle, were freckled rather than 
sunburned. Geoff Symbolor was 
quite dark, and shorter than Farley 
by half a head, though seemingly 
his equal in weight and strength. 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



79 




Their battle was a slow one. The 
two of them seemed well matched 
until Farley’s longer reach let him 
nick the muscles of Geoff s shoul- 
der. With his sword-arm handi- 
capped the shorter man was soon 
wounded again. Farley took no 
rash chances; the other was weak- 
ened by loss of blood before Farley 
drove in hard to finish him. 

“Giles the Treacherous — Glad- 
win Vanucci.’’ 

Giles was of middling size but 
wiry, with tanned face and sandy 
hair and pale innocent eyes. If it 
was indeed his habit to be treach- 
erous, there was no need for it 
today. With his long sword he 
made short work of the squat and 
massive Gladwin, who had favored 
a battle-axe. 

“Hal Coppersmith — Homer 
Garamond.” 

Hal Coopersmith was very tall, 
with sloping shoulders and long 
arms entwined by rich tattoos. His 
long sword quivered restlessly in his 
hand, like some insect’s antenna 
following the movements of his foe. 
Homer Garamond seemed sadden- 
ed by the task at hand though he 
was almost as young as Bram the 
Beardless who had shone with joy 
in killing. Homer held sword and 
dagger almost negligently in power- 
ful hands until Hal came thrusting 
in. Fast as Homer moved then it 
was not fast enough. 

“Jud Isaksson — Kanret Jon.” 

Jud, a fiery little man with an 
enormously long black mustache. 



stamped briskly into the ring with a 
round metal shield strapped onto 
his left arm, A short sword ex- 
tended from his right. Kanret, 
perhaps the oldest fighter to survive 
the first round, awaited him with a 
patience befitting his years. Kanret 
was armed with a short, thick- 
shafted spear; the way he gripped it 
indicated he might use it as a quar- 
terstaff as well as thrust with it. 
When the moment of testing came, 
the spear hit nothing but Jud’s 
shield, and Kanret Jon was brought 
down with a swordstroke to the 
knee. His end was quick thereafter. 

“LeNos of the Highlands— M’ 
Gamba Mim.” 

LeNos had a scarred face and, 
once in the ring, a way of moving 
that seemed more animal than 
human, a lithe long-striding crouch. 
With sword and dagger he closed 
on M’Gamba Mim, who was huge 
and black and carried similar 
weapons. The blood of both was on 
the ground before LeNos could pre- 
vail; and then, still like an animal, 
he snarled at the slaves who came 
to tend his cuts. 

“Mesthles of the Windy Vale — 
Octans Bukk of Pachuka.” 

Mesthles had the thought-creased 
forehead of some scribe or scholar. 
He wore peasant’s clothes and 
fought with a farmer’s scythe. 
Octans was lean, and his ragged 
clothes gave him the look of a 
hungry bandit. But his sword prov- 
ed slower than the scythe and he 
was mown.

IF 




“Omir Kelsumba — Otis Kita- 
mura.” 

Kelsumba’s wide black face was 
set in a determination as intense as 
fury. Leros, watching, remembered 
this man as the one who had asked 
about acquiring the healing powers 
of a god. When the fighters closed, 
Kelsumba swung his massive battle- 
axe with incredible power, swinging 
and then reversing instantly for the 
backswing — as if his weapon were 
no heavier than a stick. Kitamura’s 
sword was knocked aside, and then 
Kitamura’s jawbone. He went down 
on hands and knees and stayed 
there. Kelsumba left his finishing 
to the leaden mauls of the burial 
party. 

“Pernsol Muled river — Polydorus 
the Foul.” 

The Muledriver was an older 
man, who set to \Vork deliberately 
with short spear and long knife. 
Polydorus, a man of indeterminate 
age, and seemingly no fouler than 
the next, went in carrying an old 
sword, much nicked and dented. 
The old sword did its work effi- 
ciently, and Pernsol died quietly, as 
if content to end life’s struggles and 
take his modest place at Thorun’s 
board. 

“Rafael Sandoval — Rahim 
Sosias.” 

Sosias looked more like a tailor 
than a fighting man, being not 
overly big and displaying a small, 
comfortable paunch. But his curved 
sword hung as naturally from his 
hand as his hand from the end of 



his hairy arm. Sandoval was 
notably ugly, made so by nature, 
not by scars. He twirled a spike- 
and-ball mace disdainfully. Ra- 
him’s sword was caught in a loop of 
the mace’s chain and pulled from 
his hand, but before Rafael could 
disentangle his own weapon from 
the sword, Rahim had drawn an 
extra knife from concealment and 
had slit his opponent’s throat. 

“Rudolph Thadbury — Shang Ti 
the Awesome.” 

Thadbury had a military as well 
as a fighting look. Leros thought 
this man had something more of 
the general than of the simple 
swordsman about him but knew 
nothing of his background. Most of 
the contestants were as much 
strangers to Leros and the other 
priests as they were to one another. 

Squarely built, with blunt-finger- 
ed enormous hands, Rudolph 
Thadbury exuded strength and 
confidence. Shang Ti was awesome 
in truth, having a rather small head 
set on such a giant’s body that the 
head’s smallness was made to look 
grotesque. Shaiig Ti’s sword was of 
a size to suit his stature. Rudolph’s 
had a thicker blade than the usual 
and was just long enough to reach 
Shang Ti’s heart. 

“Siniuju of the Evergreen 
Slope — Thomas the Grabber.” 

Siniuju was almost scrawny, 
leaner than any other man left alive 
among the warriors. He carried a 
two-handed sword that looked too 
heavy for him — until he demon- 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



81 




strated how quickly he could make 
it move. Thomas was large and 
fierce-looking, a Shang Ti slightly 
less massive and better proportion- 
ed. He matched his spear over the 
long two-handed sword. The spear 
proved longer still. 

“Travers Sandakan — Vann the 
Nomad.” 

Sandakan came carrying a thin- 
bladed axe made with a sturdy 
armored shaft. On his face were the 
lines of time and trouble and the 
scars of many fights. Vann the No- 
mad wore the long shapeless 
sweater of the high-plains herds- 
men and wielded a long sword with 
demonic energy. Sandakan was no 
match for the Nomad and when 
Travers was dead Vann cut off one 
of his ears, saying: “I will give this 
back to him in Thorun’s hall — if he 
is man enough to take it from me!” 
It was a gesture new to Leros, who 
thought about it and finally gave a 
hesitant smile of approval. As soon 
as the latest corpse had been 
cleared from the ring he formally 
called out the names for the day’s 
final match. 

“Vladerlin Bain — Wull Nar- 
vaez.” 

Coiled around Bain’s waist was a 
long whip, whose purpose none had 
yet considered it politic to ask. In 
his hands Bain wore a dagger and a 
sword. Narvaez, with a cheerful 
foolish face and a farmer’s pitch- 
fork as his only visible weapon, 
looked like some peasant fresh 
from fieldwork. A good harvester 



he sent the tines exactly where he 
wanted them and Vladerlin was 
dead before he hit the ground, the 
reason for his coiled whip now 
never to be known. 

The sun had not yet reached its 
midday point. The fighting of the 
second round was over. 



T he sixteen fighters who re- 
mained alive moved off to enjoy 
the food prepared for them. For the 
most part they chatted and joked in 
good fellowship, though a few were 
silent. Also they took thoughtful 
notice of each other’s wounds, cal- 
culating where weakness would be 
found tomorrow. All of them knew 
that even the tiniest advantage 
must be seized. Not one survived 
among them who was not extremely 
dangerous — not one survived who 
could not count killers of superior 
ability among his victims. 

Resting after their midday meal, 
they say the messenger come pelt- 
ing down the mountain. His news 
made Leros snap back his head to 
search the sky. From where they 
camped beneath the trees it was not 
possible to see much of it. The 
warriors were curious, but not very. 
The Tournament they were engaged 
in was more important than any 
distraction they could imagine. 

Later still when a priest of the 
Inner Circle came down to talk ear- 
nestly to Leros the news spread 
among the warriors that a round, 
silvery craft had come from beyond 



82 



IF 




the world to visit Godsmountain. 
Most of them were curious enough 
to try to catch a glimpse of the ship, 
barely visible, resting among the 
trees on a distant height. 



V 

O SCAR SCHOENBERG and Athena 
'Poulson and Gus De La Torre 
had hunted again, on the day after 
Suomi’s near-fatal confrontation 
with the glacier-beast, while Bar- 
bara Hurtado and Celeste Servetus 
had gone through the motions of 
hunting. Suomi had chosen to stay 
with the ship. Oscar and Athena 
and Gus, all having had some ex- 
citement on their first day’s hunt 
but having returned from it empty 
handed returned from the second 
day’s effort with their hologram 
trophies of large predators, safely 
recorded on little crystal cubes for 
later reproduction and display. 

Athena, sitting in the lounge, 
rubbing her tired feet, complained 
it was going to be difficult to find a 
place to show off her glacier-beast. 
“It’s all right for you, Oscar, but I 
have one small apartment. I’ll have 
to move half the furniture to make 
room for this — if I dare display it at 
all, that is.” 

“Because you got it on an off- 
limits hunting trip?” Schoenberg 
laughed. “If anybody bothers you, 
just tell’em I gave it to you. Let’em 
come see me.” 

“I’ll have to leave it turned off 



most of the time, just bring it out 
for special occasions. I suppose it 
would scare off most of my usual 
visitors, anyway.” Then she caught 
herself and started to look apolo- 
getically toward Suomi, then hastily 
looked away. 

Yesterday after everyone had re- 
turned to the ship they had all lis- 
tened with some embarrassment to 
his account of how he had frozen in 
panic in the field and how Schoen- 
berg had coolly saved his life. 
Athena had been more embarrass- 
ed, perhaps, than Suomi. De La 
Torre had seemed inwardly amus- 
ed, and Barbara had shown some 
sympathy. 

Suomi wondered if his ship- 
mates — Athena especially — were 

waiting for him to demand a rifle 
and a chance to go out and prove 
himself. If so they were going to 
have a long wait. All right, he had 
been terrified. Maybe if he went out 
again and an animal charged, he 
wouldn’t be terrified. Or maybe he 
would. He wasn’t anxious to find 
out. He had nothing to prove. 
While all the others were out 
hunting on the second day he sat on 
the ship’s extended landing ramp 
enjoying the air. There was a rifle 
at hand for emergencies but if any- 
thing menacing came in sight he 
planned to simply go inside and 
close the hatch. 

Once everyone who wanted a 
trophy had one Schoenberg dallied 
in the north no longer. The hunting 
season would last a long time but 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



83 




the mysterious Tournament was 
apparently quite brief and he didn’t 
want to miss it. When Suomi men- 
tioned the Tournament to the girls, 
none of them had any clear idea of 
what it was. Some sort of physical 
contest, he supposed. 

Schoenberg evidently knew the 
way to Godsmountain, though he 
said he had not been there before. 
Flying south, he went much slower 
and lower than on the northward 
flight, paying close attention to 
landmarks. He followed a river 
valley most of the way, first by 
radar because of ground fog, then 
visually when the view had cleared. 
When, after several hours, they 
reached their destination, there was 
no mistaking it. Godsmountain 
stood out immediately from its sur- 
roundings, a wooded eminence 
practically isolated amid a patch- 
work of surrounding flat farm- 
lands, orchards and pastures. The 
mountain was broad and quite 
high, but in general not very steep. 
On the deforested summit a town- 
sized complex of white stone walls 
and buildings stood out as plainly 
as if it had been constructed as a 
beacon for aerial navigation. 

After circling the mountain once 
at a respectful distance, Schoen- 
berg slowed down some more and 
began to descend toward it. Not to 
the citadel-city on its top; he was 
careful not to even fly over that. 

A few hundred meters below the 
walls of the white city, a truncated 
pinnacle of rock rose out of the 



woods something like a dwarfed 
and naked thumb on the side of the 
mountain’s great mitten-shape. 
After noticing this pinnacle, 
Schoenberg approached it slowly, 
circled it closely, then hovered di- 
rectly over it for some time, probing 
delicately at it with the sensing in- 
struments in Orion's hull. It was 
between twenty and thirty meters 
tall, and appeared to be just barely 
climbable. There was no sign that 
man or beast had ever taken the 
trouble to reach its flattened top. 

De La Torre, now hanging onto 
the stanchion behind the pilot’s 
chair, offered: “I’d say that top is 
big enough to hold us, Oscar, even 
give us a little room to walk around 
outside the ship.’’ 

Schoenberg grunted. “That was 
my idea, to put her down there. We 
might have to cut a few steps or 
string a line to climb down. But on 
the other hand no one’s going to 
come visiting unless we invite’em.’’ 
After making a final close exam- 
ination of the pinnacle’s small mesa 
from only a few meters’ distance, 
Schoenberg set Orion down on it. 
The landing struts groped outward, 
adjusted themselves to keep the 
ship level. There was indeed enough 
flat space on the rocky table to hold 
the ship securely, with a few square 
meters left over for leg-stretching. 
All aboard disembarked for this 
purpose at once. Even high up the 
weather at this tropical latitude was 
quite warm but the girls were fully 
clothed again, in view of their un- 



84 



IF 




certainty about local morals and 
customs. Schoenberg had ordered 
all weapons left inside the ship. 

Direct inspection confirmed that 
only one side of the mesa was con- 
ceivably climbable by human be- 
ings. Even on that side there were 
places where a few pitons or some 
cut-in steps, and perhaps a rope, 
would be needed to allow even agile 
folk to make an ascent or descent in 
reasonable safety. 

“Where is everybody?” Celeste 
wondered aloud as she gazed be- 
yond the intervening sea of treetops 
at the white walls of the city on the 
summit, slightly above their level. 

De La Torre had binoculars out 
and was peering in another direc- 
tion, downslope. “There’ re thirty 
or forty men, in some kind of a 
camp. Over there. I can just make 
out some of them from time to 
time, among the trees.” 

For a while there was no better 
answer to Celeste’s question, no 
sign that Orion's arrival or her sore- 
thumb presence above the land- 
scape had been noticed. Of course 
the dense forest that covered most 
of the mountain might conceal a lot 
of movement. The trees, Suomi 
noted, looked like close analogues 
of common Earthly species. Maybe 
some mutated stocks had been 
imported by the early colonists. 
The trunks did seem to be propor- 
tionately thicker than those of most 
trees on Earth, and their branches 
tended to right-angle bends. 

About half a standard hour had 



passed since their landing, and the 
six visitors had all armed them- 
selves with binoculars, when the 
one visible gate in the city’s high 
wall suddenly opened and a small 
party of white-robed men emerged, 
vanishing from sight again almost 
at once as they plunged into the 
woods. 

Schoenberg had an infrared de- 
vice with which he could have 
followed their progress beneath the 
canopy of leaves, but he didn’t 
bother. Instead he placed his bi- 
noculars back in their case, leaned 
back and lit a cigar. Some minutes 
before Suomi had expected their 
reappearance so near at hand, the 
delegation from the city emerged 
from the woods again, this time 
into the clearing caused by rock- 
falls from the tower on which Orion 
rested. 

Schoenberg at once threw down 
his cigar and moved forward to the 
mesa’s edge and, with lifted arms, 
saluted the men below. Looking 
up, they returned the gesture with 
seeming casualness. There were 
half a dozen of them. The white 
robes of two or three were marked 
with different variations of purple 
trim. 

The distance being too great for 
anything but shouted exchanges, 
the Hunterians came leisurely 
closer. The , tall one in the lead 
reached the foot of the tower and 
began to climb. At first he made 
steady headway without much diffi- 
culty. About halfway up, however, 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



85 




a nearly sheer stretch brought him 
to a halt. He was an old man, his 
visitors saw now, despite the 
nimbleness with which he moved. 

He looked up at Schoenberg, 
who stood open-handed some ten 
meters above him, and called: 
“Outworlders, Thorun and the 
other gods of Hunters’ offer you 
greetings and grant you welcome.” 
Schoenberg made a slight bow. 
‘‘We thank Thorun and the other 
illustrious gods of Hunters’, wish- 
ing to put our thanks in such form 
as may seem to them most cour- 
teous. And we thank you too, who 
approach us as their spokesman.” 
‘‘I am Andreas, High Priest of 
Thorun’s kingdom in the world.” 
Schoenberg introduced the mem- 
bers of his party, Andreas those 
with him. After a further exchange 
of courtesies in which Schoenberg 
hinted that he would make some 
gift to Thorun as soon as he found 
out what was most suitable, he got 
around to the object of his visit. 
‘‘As all men know. Hunters’ is the 
planet most renowned in all the 
universe for the quality of its fight- 
ing men. We are told that the finest 
warriors of the planet are even now 
gathered here at Godsmountain for 
a great Tournament.” 

‘‘That is true in every word,” 
said Andreas. His speech seemed to 
outworld ears much less accented 
than Kestand’s had. 

Schoenberg proceeded. ‘‘We 
crave the favor of Thorun in being 
allowed to witness this Tournament, 



at least in part.” 

Andreas did not look toward his 
companions waiting calmly below, 
but rather across the treetops to his 
city, as if to gather in some 
message. It was only a brief glance, 
before he said: ‘‘I speak for Thorun. 
It is his pleasure to grant you your 
request. The Tournament is already 
in progress, but the most important 
rounds of fighting remain yet to be 
seen. The next is to be fought to- 
morrow.” 



ANDREAS talked a little longer 
with the outworlders, promis- 
ing that in the morning he would 
send a guide to conduct them to the 
fighting ring in plenty of time to see 
the day’s events there. He promised 
them also that sometime during 
their stay they would be invited into 
the city and entertained in Thorun’s 
temple as befitted distinguished 
guests. He acknowledged Schoen- 
berg’s promise that a gift for Tho- 
run would be forthcoming. And 
then the priests and the outworlders 
exchanged polite farewells. 

During the short hike back to the 
city Andreas was thoughtful and 
more than usually aloof. His subor- 
dinates, walking with him, took 
careful note of his mood and did 
not intrude upon him. 

He was an old man by Hunterian 
standards, scarred by a dozen 
serious wounds, the survivor of a 
hundred fights. He was no longer a 
warrior of great prowess, his 



B6

muscles now suffering the wastage 
of time and maltreatment. Nimble 
climbing cost him much more 
effort than he allowed to show. The 
skull looked out from behind his 
face more plainly with the passage 
of every sixtieth-of-an-old-man’s- 
life — what the outworlders would 
call a Standard Year. 

In this progressive change of his 
facial appearance he found 
pleasure. 

Though his legs were tired he 
maintained a brisk pace and it was 
not long before he had led his party 
back into the city. 

There he brushed aside subor- 
dinates who were waiting to 
entangle him in a hundred ques- 
tions and disputes about the 
visitors. These men, below the level 
of the Inner Circle, understood no- 
thing. Essentially alone, Andreas 
strode quickly and still thoughtfully 
through the network of bright, 
narrow streets. Servants, artisans, 
soldiers and aristocrats alike all 
took themselves out of his way. On 
the steps before the tall outer doors 
of the Temple of Thorun a pair of 
Inner Circle aristocrats in purple- 
spangled robes broke off their con- 
versation to bow respectfully, a sa- 
lute that Andreas acknowledged 
with a scarcely conscious nod. A 
courtesan alighting from her litter 
bowed more deeply. She was evi- 
dently the woman of some non- 
celibate priest below the Inner 
Circle. Andreas acknowledged her 
not at all. 



In the Outer Temple the light 
was good, the sun coming in 
strongly through the hypaethrus in 
the roof; and here a low- voiced 
chant of war, to muffled drum, 
went up from acolytes who knelt 
before an altar piled with enemy 
warriors’ skulls and captured wea- 
pons. An armed guard who stood 
before the entrance to the Inner 
Temple saluted Andreas and 
stepped aside, pulling the great 
door open for him. Broad stairs 
went down. The room to which they 
led was vast, built partially below 
the level of the sunlit streets out- 
side. 

Here in the Inner Temple the 
light was indirect and dim, filtered 
through many small portals. An- 
dreas pushed aside hanging after 
hanging of chain mail with prac- 
ticed hands, made his way across 
the enormous chamber. He passed 
a place where a single devout wor- 
shipper knelt, a fighting man with 
shield and sword in hand, a priest- 
general dressed all in white, pray- 
ing silently before a tall stone 
statue. The statue, highly stylized, 
portrayed a man in smooth, tight- 
fitting outworlder’s garb. He wore a 
round and almost featureless helm 
and had a grim, beardless face — 
Karlsen, a demigod of the distant 
past, a sword in his right hand, a 
stick-like outworld weapon in his 
left. Andreas’ face was set like 
stone. But to have the statue re- 
moved would cause trouble. Karl- 
sen was still a popular figure with 



BERSERKER^S PLANET 



87 




many of the people. 

From this point on the way An- 
dreas took was not open, or even 
known, to more than a very few. He 
went behind more chain mail cur- 
tains into a comer where an incon- 
spicuous passageway began. Again 
there were descending stairs, 
dimmer and much narrower than 
before. At the bottom a small oil 
lamp burned in a wall niche, giving 
enough light to enable a man to 
walk without groping, no more. 
Here were the tall and massive 
doors that led to Thorun’s hall. 
From behind these doors at times 
came flaring lights, the sound of 
harp and drum and horn and 
booming laughter. At these times 
novices were allowed to stand wide- 
eyed at the foot of the stairs and 
briefly watch and listen, observing 
from afar the evidences of gods and 
heroes at feast within. 

Andreas carried one of the two 
keys that could open the doors of 
Thorun’s hall. Lachaise, Chief Ar- 
tisan of the Temple and, of course, 
a member of the Inner Circle, had 
the other. A door swung open for 
Andreas now, when he turned his 
key in the proper secret way, and he 
quickly stepped through and pulled 
the door tightly shut again behind 
him. 



T he Great Hall of Thorun, carved 
out of the living rock beneath 
the Temple, was perhaps five 
meters long, three wide, three 



high — certainly modest enough in 
all conscience for the master of the 
world. The walls, floor, and ceiling 
were rough, bare stone; Thorun’s 
hall had never been finished. Quite 
likely it never would be. Work on it 
had begun, he supposed, almost 
twenty Hunterian years ago, five 
times an old-man’s-lifetime. A little 
work had still been done in the 
tenure of the previous High Priest. 
But since then plans had changed. 
The place was big enough already 
to fill its only real function; duping 
novices. There was an air passage 
above so that bright torches could 
be burned to cast their light out 
under and around the doors, there 
were musical instruments piled in a 
corner. As for the booming, godlike 
laughter — either Thorun or Mjoll- 
nir could do that. 

Thorun was in his hall, seated at 
a table that nearly filled the inade- 
quate rbom. So huge was he that, 
even though seated, his eyes were 
on a level with those of the tall 
priest standing before him. Tho- 
run’s head of wild dark hair was 
bound by a golden band, his fur 
cloak hung about his mountainous 
shoulders. His famed sword, so 
large that no man could wield it, 
was girdled to his waist. His huge 
right hand, concealed as always in 
a leather glove, rested on the table 
and held a massive goblet. Seen in 
the dim light, Thorun’s face above 
his full dark beard might have been 
judged human — except that it was 
too 'immobile and too large.

Thorun did not move. Neither 
did the demigod: Mjollnir, seated at 
another side of the table, head 
bound in a silver band, wrapped in 
his dark cloak. Of nearly equal size 
with the god of war and the hunt, 
Mjollnir shared Thorun’s foodless 
and drinkless feast in gloomy com- 
radeship. 

After entering the room Andreas 
had waited for a little while, stand- 
ing motionless, watching — making 
sure neither of them was going to 
be triggered into movement by his 
entry. Sometimes they were. One 
had to be careful. Satisfied, he 
walked around the high table and 
passed behind the chair of Thorun. 
There in the wall was set a small 
and secret door for which no key 
was necessary. Andreas opened this 
door by pressure in the proper 
place. Behind it another narrow 
stone stair wound down. 

The descent was longer this time. 
At the bottom of the final stair 
Andreas turned first to his left. 
After three or four strides in that 
direction he emerged from a narrow 
tunnel to stand on the bottom of an 
enormous pit dug out of the rock 
beside the Temple. The excavation 
of this pit had consumed in labor 
the lifetimes of many slaves, having 
been started during the tenure of 
the fifth High Priest to hold office 
before Andreas; so farseeing and 
magnificent were the plans, now 
coming to fruition, of the true god! 
At its top the pit was surrounded by 
white stone walls and covered by a 



roof, so that it looked from the out- 
side merely like one more building 
in the Temple complex, in no way 
remarkable amid the maze of struc- 
tures that all looked more or less 
alike. 

Andreas went back into the 
tunnel and followed it back in the 
direction that led right from the 
foot of the stair. Before entering the 
doorless chamber to which this 
passage brought him, he paused 
and closed his eyes in reverent imi- 
tation of Death, murmured a brief 
private prayer. Certainly not to 
Thorun. Thorun was a thing, a 
tool, part of a necessary deception 
practiced on the masses, a decep- 
tion that Andreas had left behind 
him in the Temple. What now lay 
ahead was, for him, the ultimate — 
the only — reality. 

The chamber Andreas now 
entered was as old as anything 
made by man on Hunters’ planet. 
Dim daylight lit it now, filtering 
indirectly down through an over- 
head shaft open at some high place 
to the sunlight and barred by heavy 
grills at many places along its 
length. It was a little larger than 
Thorun’s hall above. A hundred 
people might have squeezed them- 
selves into this room but never had. 
Fewer than ten people now even 
knew of its existence. 

Against the wall opposite the 
single doorway stood a low wooden 
table bearing a half dozen boxes of 
bright metal. Each box was of a 
different shape, and each rested in 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



89 




a depression or socket carved to its 
shape in the dark panels of the 
tabletop. The outer surfaces of the 
boxes were precisely machined and 
shaped, products of a finer tech- 
nology than any sword-making 
smithy. Tubes and cables of smooth 
gray and black ran among the 
boxes in a maze of interconnec- 
tions. 

On second look the wooden 
frame supporting the boxes was not 
really a table, but something more 
like a litter or sedan chair, though 
not made to accommodate the 
human form. From opposite ends 
of the litter extended pairs of sturdy 
carrying arms with carven grips, so 
six or eight humans could bear the 
whole assembly. The carrying 
handles were worn with long usage, 
but the litter, like the rest of the 
chamber, was very clean. 

The pale stone of the floor shone 
faintly in the dim light. Only the 
low stone altar in the center of the 
room was darkened by old and 
ineradicable stains, rust from the 
inset iron rings to which victims’ 
limbs were sometimes bound, rust- 
colored old blood at the places over 
which the victims’ organs were re- 
moved. Before the litter, like fruit, 
the skulls of babies filled a bowl. 
Offerings of flowers lay scattered in 
small heaps, never in vases. Nearly 
all of the flowers were dead. 

After he entered the room An- 
dreas lowered himself to his knees, 
then down and fully prostrate on 
the floor, head and outstretched 



arms pointing toward the altar and 
beyond it to the litter with its 
metallic burden. 



ARISE, Andreas,” said a steady, 

r\. inhuman voice. It came 
from among the metal boxes, where 
a small wooden frame stood on its 
side holding a stretching drumskin. 
In the center of the drumskin a 
small gleam of metal showed. The 
voice produced by the drumskin 
was seldom loud, though a similar 
device had been put inside Thorun 
to let him bellow and laugh. This, 
the quiet voice of Death, was more 
like a drum-sound than anything 
else Andreas had ever heard — and 
yet it was not very like a drum. 

Andreas arose and came around 
the altar, approached the litter, 
once more made obeisance to the 
boxes on it, this time only on one 
knee. ‘‘Oh Death,” he said in a soft 
and reverent voice, ‘‘it is truly a 
starship, and its pilot chose to land 
on the rock where you in your 
wisdom foresaw that such a ship 
might land. I am going shortly to 
prepare Mjollnir for his task, and 
to choose soldiers to go with him. I 
have already carried out your other 
orders in every particular.” 

The drum-voice asked: “How 
many outworlders came with the 
ship?” 

‘‘I have seen six, and there is no 
evidence that others are aboard. 
Wonderful is your wisdom, oh 
Death, who could predict that such 



IF 




men would be lured across the sky 
to watch our Tournament. Won- 
derful and — ” 

“Was there any mention of the 
man, the badlife, named Johann 
Karlsen?” 

“No, Death.” Andreas was a 
little puzzled. Surely the man Karl- 
sen must be long since dead. But 
the god Death was wise beyond 
mere human understanding; An- 
dreas had long since been con- 
vinced of that. He waited worship- 
fully for another question. 

After a brief silence it came. 
“And they are private hunters? 
Poachers by their own laws?” 

“Yes, Lord Death, their spokes- 
man said they had been hunting. 
No one in their outworld govern- 
ment will know that they are here.” 

Prompted by occasional further 
questions Andreas spoke on, telling 
in some detail all that he had so far 
managed to learn about the visitors 
and their spacecraft. 

He was certain it would not be 
too big to fit into the pit beside the 
Temple. 

VI 

THE day after Orion's land- 
ing, Leros led the sixteen 
Tournament contenders who were 
still alive up the mountain to a new 
and higher camp. There, when rou- 
tine matters had been gotten out of 
the way, he read the pairings for 
the third round of the Tournament: 



Bram the Beardless of Consiglor 
Charles the Upright 

Col Renba 
Farley of Eikosk 

Giles the Treacherous 
Hal Coppersmith 

Jud Isaksson 

LeNos of the Highlands 

Mesthles of the Windy Vale 
Omir Kelsumba 

Polydorus the Foul 
Rahim Sosias 

Rudolph Thadbury 
Thomas the Grabber 

Vann the Nomad 
Wull Narvaez 

The priest of the Inner Circle 
who had come down from the city 
yesterday had informed Leros and 
the warriors that they could expect 
a group of outworlders to appear 
today. The Tournament was to go 
on almost as usual, and the utmost 
courtesy was to be shown the out- 
worlders. If they behave strangely, 
ignore it. There will probably even 
be women among them; pay no at- 
tention to that, either. Leros was 
also instructed to call frequent re- 
cesses in the fighting for prayer and 
ceremony. 

The warriors had little thought to 
spare for anything that did not 
directly concern their own survival 
in the Tournament, and the arrival 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



91 




of the visitors and their guide when 
Leros was halfway through reading 
the lists caused no interruption. 
Four visitors came, and two of 
them were women but, Leros noted 
with some relief, modestly dressed. 
He had heard some tall tales of out- 
world ways. He was not pleased to 
have such onlookers — but perhaps 
Thorun was, for some obscure and 
godly reason. In any event, orders 
were orders, and Leros had endured 
harder ones than this. 

This day’s fighting ring had been 
stamped out at the head of a gentle 
slope in an area where the trees 
were thin. From the ring the out- 
worlders’ ship was readily visible a 
few hundred meters away on its 
truncated pinnacle of rock. The 
massive ball of bright metal that 
carried folk out among the stars 
showed a single open doorway in its 
otherwise featureless surface. Two 
more outworlders were sometimes 
visible, tiny figures sitting or stand- 
ing on the little lip of rock before 
the ship. 



y^HENA, standing at ringside be- 
side Schoenberg and waiting 
somewhat nervously for the action 
to begin, whispered to him: “Are 
you sure this is going to be fighting 
for keeps?’’ 

“That’s what our guide tells us. I 
expect he knows what’s going on.’’ 
Schoenberg was watching the prep- 
arations with keen interest, not 
looking at her when he answered. 



low-voiced. 

“But if what he told us is true, 
each of these men has already been 
through two duels in this tourna- 
ment. And look — there’s hardly a 
mark on any of them.’’ 

“I can see a few bandages,’’ 
Schoenberg whispered back. “But 
you may have a point.’’ He con- 
sidered the matter. “It could well 
be this: fighting from an animal’s 
back apparently isn’t done here. 
Therefore men have to move around 
strictly on their own muscle power, 
and can’t wear a lot of heavy body 
armor. So a clean hit from any type 
of weapon is going to leave a serious 
wound, not just a minor gash or 
bruise. Most wounds are serious, 
and the first man to be disabled by 
a serious wound is almost certainly 
the loser. Ergo, winners don’t show 
up for the next round with serious 
wounds.’’ 

They fell silent then, since Leros 
was looking in their direction and 
perhaps was ready to get the action 
started. Two men with weapons 
ready were facing each other from 
opposite sides of the ring. De La 
Torre and Celeste also became 
utterly attentive. 

Leros cleared his throat. “Bram 
the Beardless — Charles the Up- 
right.’’ 

S UOMI, standing atop the mesa 
beside Barbara Hurtado and 
looking toward the ring from there, 
was too far away to hear Leros call 



92 



IF 




the names, but through his binocu- 
lars he saw two men with raised 
weapons start toward each other 
across the fighting ring. He put the 
binoculars down then and turned 
away, wondering how in the uni- 
verse he had managed to get him- 
self involved in this sickening busi- 
ness. For hunting animals one 
could find or fabricate some reason 
or excuse, but not for this — and 
there was Athena, over at ringside, 
an avid observer. 

“Someone should do an anthro- 
pological study,” she had explained 
to him just a little while ago, while 
getting ready to leave the ship. “If 
they’re really fighting each other to 
the death over there.” Their guide- 
to-be, a tall, white-robed youth, 
had just been explaining the Tour- 
nament to them in some detail. 
“You’re not an anthropologist.” 
“There isn’t a professional one 
here. Still, it’s a job that should be 
done.” She went on getting ready, 
clipping a small audiovideo re- 
corder to her belt, next to the 
hologram camera. 

“Is Schoenberg here to do an an- 
thropological study too?” 

“Ask him. Carl, if you hate 
Oscar so much and can’t stand to 
look at life in the raw — why did you 
come along on this trip? Why did 
you get me to ask Oscar to invite 
you?” 

He drew a deep breath. “We’ve 
been through that.” 

“Tell me again. I would really 
like to know.” 



“All right. I came because of 
you. You are the most desirable 
woman I have ever known. I mean 
more than sex. Sex included, of 
course — but I want the part of you 
that Schoenberg has.” 

“He doesn’t have me, as you put 
it. I’ve worked for Oscar five years 
now, and he has my admiration — ” 
“Why your admiration?” 
“Because he’s strong. There’s a 
kind of strength in you too, Carl, a 
different kind, that I’ve admired 
also. Oscar has my admiration and 
often my companionship — because 
I enjoy his company. He and I have 
had sex together a few times, and 
that, too, has been enjoyable. But 
he doesn’t have me. No one does. 
No one will.” 

“When you come of yourself as a 
free gift, then someone will.” 

“No one.” 



B ram and Charles were sparring 
cautiously in the day’s first 
duel, neither of them having yet 
decided on an all-out rush. Though 
they were of a height Charles the 
Upright was much leaner, his back 
so straight that the reason for his 
name was obvious. He wore a loose 
jacket of fine leather and had a 
darkly handsome face. 

Athena thought he showed in- 
credible poise, waiting with his 
long, sharp-looking sword lifted in 
one hand, aimed at his opponent. 
Surely, she thought, this was not 
life-and-death after all. No matter 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



93 




how seriously they took it, it must 
be some play, some game, with a 
symbolic loser stepping aside . 
and yet all the time she was telling 
herself this she knew better. 

“Come,” Charles was murmur- 
ing, sounding like a man urging on 
some animal. “Come. Now. Now.'" 

And beardless Bram, all youth 
and freakish strength, came on, 
first one step, then two, then in an 
awesome rush, his sword first raised 
then slashing down. The sharp 
blades rang together, the two men 
grunted. Incoherent cries of excite- 
ment went up around the watching 
circle. Charles, fending off blow 
after blow, was giving way now. He 
seemed to lose his footing momen- 
tarily in a slip, then lashed out with 
a counterstroke that brought a 
hoarse noise of appreciation from 
the warriors who stood watching 
with knowledgeable eyes. Bram 
avoided the blow and was unhurt 
but his rushing attack had been 
brought to a standstill. Athena for 
the first time began to realize that 
fine skill must reign here on the 
same throne with brutality. 

Bram stood quietly for a mo- 
ment, frowning as if at the unex- 
pected resistance of some inanimate 
object. Then suddenly he charged 
again, more violently if possible 
than before. The long swords 
blurred and sang together, sprang 
apart, blurred and sang again. 
Athena began now to see and 
understand the timing and strategy 
of the strokes. She was forgetting 



herself, her eyes and mind opening 
more fully for perception. Then all 
at once, somehow — for all her con- 
centration she had not seen how — 
Charles’s sword was no longer in 
his hand. Instead it sprouted be- 
tween Bram’s ribs, the hilt firmly 
affixed before Bram’s breastbone, 
half a meter of blade protruding 
gory and grotesque from his broad 
back. 

Bram shook his head, one, two, 
three times, in what seemed utter 
disbelief. Athena saw it all with 
great clarity and it all seemed very 
slow. Bram was still waving his own 
sword, but now he seemed unable 
to locate his newly disarmed op- 
ponent, standing in plain sight in 
front of him. Suddenly, awkwardly, 
Bram sat, dropped his weapon and 
raised a hand to his face, brushing 
at it as if struck by the thought that 
now his beard would never grow. 
The hand fell limp and Bram 
slumped farther, his head tilting 
forward on his chest. The pose- 
looked incredibly uncomfortable, 
but he bore it without complaint. 
Only when a gray-clad slave limped 
forward to drag the body to one 
side did Athena fully understand 
that the man — the boy — had died 
before her eyes. 

Charles the Upright extracted his 
sword with a strong pull and held it 
out to another slave for cleaning — 
while yet another spilled sand over 
the place where Bram had spilled 
his life. In the background some- 
one was digging. The world had

IF 




changed in the space of a few mo- 
ments, or rather Athena had been 
changed. Never again would she be 
the same. 

“Col Renba — Farley of Eikosk.” 

The man who started forward at 
the name of Col Renba was big, 
brown, and shaggy. He stood near 
the center of the arena whirling a 
mace, a spike-studded ball on the 
end of a short chain, and waited for 
Farley to come after him. 

Oscar was saying something to 
her, but there was no time to listen 
or think, no time for anything but 
watching. No time for Oscar, even. 

Farley of Eikosk, fair and 
freckled, tall and well made if not 
exactly handsome, came treading 
catlike in fine leather boots. His 
other garments were simple, but of 
rich sturdy cloth. He squinted in 
the sun that shone oh the fine 
polished steel of his sword and 
knife. Holding a weapon in either 
hand, he feinted an advance to 
within striking range of the mace, 
and nodded as if with satisfaction 
when he saw how rapidly the spiked 
weight on its taut chain arched out 
at him and back again. 

Now Farley began to circle, 
moving around Col Renba first one 
way and then the other. The mace 
came out after him, faster than be- 
fore, faster than had seemed pos- 
sible to Athena, and she cried out, 
unaware that she did so. Again she 
cried out, in relief this time, when 
she saw that the spikes had missed 
Farley’s fine, fair skin. 



Momentarily both men were still, 
and then again there came a rapid 
passage of arms, too fast for 
Athena to judge. She thought the 
flurry was over, when suddenly the 
tip of one of the mace’s spikes 
touched Farley on the hand, and 
his dagger flew lightly but awk- 
wardly away. In almost the same 
moment Farley’s long sword bit 
back, and now Col Renba backed 
away, keeping the mace twirling 
with his right hand, his left arm 
curled up as if trying to protect 
itself from further damage while its 
sleeve rapidly drenched red. 

Each man’s left arm was bleeding 
now, and Farley’s at least appeared 
no longer usable. Along the back of 
his hand there showed the white of 
splintered bone. The bright blade 
of his long dagger lay buried in the 
dust. 

When the mace-spinner saw the 
extent of the damage he had in- 
flicted, and found that his own left 
arm could at least be held up out of 
the way, he stopped backing off 
and began to advance once again. 
He kept the ugly weight of death 
moving around him in a smooth 
ellipse. As Col stepped closer, 
Farley began to retreat, but only 
began. As the mace sighed past 
him his long speed-thrust to the 
throat caught Col stepping in. Col 
Renba died, the mace flying wide 
from his hand in a great arc, 
spinning over the shouting, dodging 
ring of watchers. 

A long moment after the other 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



95 




watchers’ outcries had died away, 
Athena was still shouting. She 
realized this and shut up and let go 
of Schoenberg, whose arm and 
shoulder had somehow come into 
her spasmodic two-handed grip. 
Oscar was looking at her strangely, 
and so was De La Torre, who stood 
with his arm around a bored-look- 
ing Celeste a little distance off. 

But Athena forgot about them. 
Already men were getting ready to 
fight again. 



the Treacherous — Hal 
\jCoppersmith . ” 

Coppersmith was the leaner of 
this pair, and much the taller. He 
was content to begin on the defen- 
sive, holding his long swOrd like the 
sensing organ of some giant insect. 
Giles the Treacherous had sandy 
hair, an air of earnest perseverance, 
and (like the most successful 
traitors, thought Athena) an open 
trustworthiness in his face. He was 
not big, and did not appear to be 
exceptionally strong, but still 
maneuvered his own long blade 
with an assured economy of effort. 
Now it was high, now low, without 
Athena being aware that it had 
started to move. Hal Coppersmith 
had similar difficulties, it seemed. 
His elbow was gashed, and then his 
knee, and then the great muscle in 
his tattooed upper arm was cut 
nearly through. Then nothing re- 
mained but butchery. Giles stepped 
back with an expression of distaste. 



A slave limped forward to swing a 
maul and end Hal’s silent, thrash- 
ing agony. 

“Jud Isaksson — LeNos of the 
Highlands.” 

LeNos sprang to the attack al- 
most before the signal had been 
given, his fierce scarred face thrust 
forward like a shield. In either 
hand he held a wide blade, moving 
and flashing like the hub-knives on 
a chariot. And little Isaksson, 
whooping as if he were overjoyed to 
meet a fighter so aggressive, shot 
forward fast enough to clash with 
LeNos almost in the middle of the 
trodden circle. The round metal 
shield on Jud’s left arm rang like 
some maddened blacksmith’s anvil 
under the barrage of his enemy’s 
blows. LeNos seemed incapable of 
imagining a defensive move, let 
alone performing one. He only 
pushed his own two-handed attack 
so maniacally that it seemed impos- 
sible for his opponent to find a 
sliver of time and space in which to 
counterattack. 

At such a pace the fight could 
not and did not last long. LeNos’s 
driving sword arm was suddenly 
stilled, pinned in mid-air on the 
long, thick needle of Isaksson’s 
sword. The highlander’s dagger 
kept flashing on, but still Jud’s 
bright-scarred shield took the 
blows. Then Jud yanked his sword 
free, of the ruined arm as he did, 
and brought it back, hacking, 
faster and faster, with a violence 
wilder if anything than his op- 



96 



IF 




ponent’s had been. LeNos was in 
several pieces before he died. 



that’s the matter?” An in- 
sistent voice had repeated 
the question to her several times, 
Athena realized. Schoenberg was 
gripping her firmly by both arms, 
and giving her a slight shaking. He 
was looking closely into her face. 
When her eyes focused on his, the 
expression in his changed from 
concern to an odd mixture of 
amusement and contempt. 

“Nothing’s the matter. What do 
you mean? I’m all right.” She kept 
looking for the next fight to start, 
and then realized that the priest in 
charge, Leros or whatever his name 
was, must have just ordered a re- 
cess. Slowly she realized that she 
had come near losing herself in the 
excitement of the fighting, tempo- 
rarily losing control of her own be- 
havior as if with drugs or sex. But 
no, it was all right. A near thing, 
but she still controlled herself. 

Schoenberg, still looking at her 
with some concern, said now: “We 
had better give Carlos and Barbara 
a chance to see a thing or two.” 

“Him?” she laughed abruptly, 
contemptuously. ‘‘This isn’t for 
him. Thank you for bringing me, 
Oscar.” 

“Nevertheless I think you’ve had 
enough.” 

De La Torre peered around 
Oscar at her. “I have, too, for the 



time being. Shall we walk back to 
the ship, Athena?” 

“I’m staying.” 

Her tone was such that neither of 
the men made any further argu- 
ment. Celeste meanwhile had 
moved next* to Schoenberg; she was 
watching him more than what was 
going on in the ring. “I’m going, 
then,” said De La Torre, and he 
was off. 



S UOMI, having handed over his 
sentry’s rifle to De La Torre, 
slid and clambered down the steep 
slope from the mesa’s top, holding 
on to the retractable rope that they 
had secured at the top to make the 
climb less dangerous. On this one 
face of the mesa the slope for the 
most part was not quite precipi-. 
tous; there were some patches of 
gravelly soil and a bush or two. 
Already a visible path was being 
worn. 

When he reached the level of the 
forest Suomi set off immediately in 
the direction of the tournament. 
Athena was there, not just for a 
quick look, but remaining there by 
choice to see it all. A purely scien- 
tific interest? Anthropology? She 
had never been enthusiastic on that 
subject before today, not around 
Suomi anyway. Maybe the tourna- 
ment wasn’t, after all, as murderous 
a business as he had been led to 
believe. Neither Suomi nor Barbara 
had watched. De La Torre, coming 
back, had said nothing about it and 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



97 




Suomi had not asked him. But 
maybe it was just as bloody as the 
guide had warned them, and she 
was still there taking it in. If she 
was like that, he had better know 
about it. 

Nothing horrible was going on in 
the ring as he emerged from the 
forest and drew near. People were 
simply standing about, waiting, 
while a white-robed man went 
through some kind of ceremony 
before a simple altar. As Suomi 
came up Schoenberg nodded a 
greeting to him. Athena gave Suomi 
a preoccupied look. She was upset 
about something, he thought, but 
she gave no indication of wanting to 
be elsewhere. His attention was 
soon pulled away from her. 

“Omir Kelsumba — Mesthles of 
the Windy Vale.” 

On springy legs massive as tree 
trunks Kelsumba moved forward, 
black skin gleaming, axe cradled 
almost like an infant in his awesome 
arms. Mesthles, spare and graying, 
thoughtful-looking, somewhat bat- 
tered by time like the ancient scythe 
with which he meant to fight, kept 
at a respectful distance from Kel- 
sumba for a little while, retreating 
with economical movements, study- 
ing the movements of his foe. Now 
the axe came after him, startling 
Suomi with its speed, and with such 
power and weight behind it that it 
seemed nothing human should be 
able to turn the blow aside. Mesth- 
les made no mistakes, had his 
scythe-blade in the right place to 



turn the axe, but the jarring impact 
when the blades met came near to 
knocking Mesthles down. Another 
axe-blow fell on the scythe, and 
then another. Mesthles could not 
get into position to strike back. 
After the fourth or fifth parry, the 
scythe-blade broke. A groaning 
murmur, like the foretaste of blood, 
came up from the ring of watchers, 
and Suomi heard part of it coming 
from Athena. He saw the moist- 
lipped rapture on her face as she 
watched the fight, oblivious to him 
and all else. 

Broken weapon still tightly in his 
grip, its jagged blade still danger- 
ous, Mesthles maintained his calm, 
and showed more agility than his 
appearance suggested. For some 
time he avoided being pinned 
against the side of the fighting ring. 
Neither he nor any of the other 
fighters ever seemed to consider 
stepping across that simple line and 
outside the ring, any more than 
they would consider jumping 
through a wall. 

The axe now came after Mesthles 
in what looked like a continuous 
blur, seeming to pull its giant 
owner after it. It struck Mesthles at 
last, full in the back, as he twisted 
his body in trying to dodge it yet 
again. His fallen body continued 
jerking, twitching, moving. A slave 
limped forward with a maul and 
dealt the finishing blow. 

Suomi’s gut worked suddenly, 
labored wretchedly, rejected in a 
spasm what remained of the little

IF 




he had taken for his breakfast. I 
should have tranquilized myself, he 
thought. It was too late now. He 
faced away from the ring but could 
do nothing more before the vomit 
came. If he was desecrating holy 
ground, well, they would have to 
kill him for it. But when he 
straightened up it seemed that no 
one was paying him any attention 
at all. Whether it was delicacy or 
lack of interest he could not tell. 

“Polydorns the Foul — Rahim 
Sosias.” 

Suomi found that he could 
watch. Polydorus, looking no more 
foul than his competitors, bran- 
dished a battered sword with ob- 
vious strength and energy. Sosias 
was paunchy and short, yet he 
somehow managed to draw first 
blood with his scimitar, making an 
ugly slice among Polydorus’s left 
shoulder. Polydorus was galvanized 
rather than weakened by the injury, 
and pressed an attack so hard that 
for a few moments it seemed he 
might prevail. But then he aimed a 
long thrust poorly, and stood look- 
ing down at his own right hand and 
forearm where he had just stepped 
on it. He grimaced and spat toward 
Sosias before the scimitar came 
back to take his life. 

The white-clad priest was in the 
ring again, and it appeared there 
was going to be another recess. Not 
that it mattered to Suomi. He 
turned away, deliberately this time. 
He had found out that he could 
watch whatever further maiming 



might occur; but still he much pre- 
ferred not to watch. 

He stepped closer to Schoenberg 
and Athena, managed to catch the 
eye of the former but not the latter, 
and said; “I’m going back to the 
ship.’’ He glanced at Celeste, but 
she only gave him a bored look and 
moved a little closer to Schoenberg. 

Suomi turned away from them 
all and trudged back among the 
trees. It was good to be briefly 
alone again, but here in this alien 
forest was . no place to stop** and 
think. 

When he got back to the foot of 
the mesa, he found that the climb- 
ing rope had been pulled up. Not in 
the mood to try the ascent without 
it, Suomi called out. A few seconds 
later De La Torre’s head and bare 
shoulders appeared at the top of 
the slope. “What’s up?’’ he called 
down. 

“I’ve seen enough. Throw down 
the rope.’’ 

“All right.’’ In a moment the 
rope came snaking down. 



W HEN Suomi got to the top he 
saw that Barbara lay naked 
on a foam mattress so close to the 
climbing path that De La Torre 
could sit on the mattress beside her 
and do acceptable sentry duty. 
Suomi noticed also that a pair of 
binoculars had been set up on a tri- 
pod beside the mattress in such a 
way that a man lying there, perhaps 
with a woman beneath him, could 



BERSERKER’S PLANET 



99 




observe uninterruptedly what was 
going on in the fighting ring. 

De La Torre apparently was 
finished for the time being with 
binoculars, mattress, and girl; he 
had pulled on a pair of shorts al- 
ready and was continuing to dress. 
His voice was mild and lazy. “I’ll 
turn the rifle back to you, then, 
Carlos, and go down again myself.’’ 

Before Suomi had gotten the 
rifle’s still-unfamiliar strap adjust- 
ed to fit his shoulder, De La Torre 
was gone again. Suomi watched 
him out of sight, then said to 
Barbara, who still lay curled up 
tiredly on her mattress: “And how 
are things with you?’’ 

She moved a little, and said in a 
small voice: “Life appears pos- 
sible.’’ Never had he seen Barbara 
so obviously depressed before. He 
had lain with her a couple of times 
on the long trip out, and with Ce- 
leste a couple of times. Not with 
Athena, though, on the trip out he 
could no longer be casual with her. 
Now perhaps he could. 

Barbara was the only one of them 
who had refused to watch the tour- 
nament at all. So of course the 
sadist De La Torre had had to pick 
her for his object, his receptacle . 
Suomi wanted to say something 
good to her but could think of 
nothing. Tomorrow her nakedness 
might arouse his own lust again but 
right now it only made her seem de- 
fenseless and pitiable, lying there 
face down. So, she had wanted to 
come along on a luxurious space 



voyage with a billionaire, and her 
wish had been granted. She was 
earning her passage. 

No need to walk a sentry’s route 
around the ship; there was only the 
one route by which one could 
ascend. Standing at the head of the 
path, looking out over the treetops 
without binoculars, Suomi could 
see De La Torre arriving at the side 
of the fighting ring. The next duel 
had still not gotten underway, evi- 
dently; there were still four men 
waiting to fight, if Suomi was 
reading the arrangement of the dis- 
tant figures correctly. The binocu- 
lars were handy but he did not care 
enough to pick them up. Perhaps 
he did not want to acknowledge 
their present positioning by moving 
them. 

It promised to be a long few days 
ahead, until the Tournament 
slaughtered itself into extinction, 
and then a very long trip home. But 
there were compensations. It had 
been made clear that whatever had 
seemed to be growing between him 
and Athena had no real existence. 
It was not over — it had never been. 

Barbara was sitting up and doing 
things with her fingers to her hair, 
not yet in a mood to talk. Suomi, 
turning to look to the north from 
this high place, saw or thought he 
saw the mountainous glaciers of 
hunting country looming just over 
the horizon there, like unsupported 
clouds. 

What was that sound, just now? 
The path was clear. Some small 



100 



IF 




animal or flying creature, then. 
Never mind. 

Well, things were no doubt going 
to be socially uncomfortable on the 
trip home, but it was well worth it 
to have settled the thing between 
them, that might otherwise have 
dragged on much longer. You had 
to consider this a favorable conclu- 
sion. If they had . 

Did they have woodpeckers here? 
He couldn’t see the bird anywhere 
but still the sound came almost 
continuously. Must be down under 
the treetops somewhere. There was 
also a faint polyphonic roar from 
the direction of the Tournament, 
what must have been a loud yell to 
be audible this far away, but he did 
not try to see what had happened 
there. 

Barbara was standing up, her 
clothes in hand. “I’m going in for a 
shower, Carlos.’’ 

“All right.’’ He watched her walk 
away. Women. Magnificent, but 
who could understand them? 

And then, while on the subject of 
magnificence, there had been the 
animal, the glacier-beast, whose 
power and beauty had frozen Suomi 
in awe and terror as it charged 
down upon him. He now felt, sur- 
prisingly, some small regret that he 
had not killed it. Better, of course, 
if it had been allowed to live . 
yet, what was it Thoreau had 
written? There is a time in the lives 
of nations, as of individuals, when 
the best hunters are the best men. 
Something like that. The nation of 



interstellar man had presumably 
long since passed that stage, of 
course. And so had Carlos Suomi in 
his individual life. Or he should 
have. Schoenberg, on the other 
hand, though something more than 
a mere sadist — 



I N HIS mind the perception of the 
nagging tapping sound clicked 
suddenly into place with a remem- 
bered visual image, that of stone 
being worked by hard metal, more 
precisely that of steps being cut in 
the side of the mesa by Schoenberg, 
hanging on the rope with moun- 
taineers’ implements in hand. 
Suomi had not made the connec- 
tion before because the sounds he 
was now hearing were too rapid. No 
one could wield a hammer at such a 
speed. And at the same time they 
sounded too irregular to be made 
by an automatic tool. 

The climbable face of rock was 
still unoccupied. Suomi had started 
around the ship to check the other 
sides of the mesa when he beheld in 
front of him someone, something, 
climbing carefully up over the rim 
and into sight. A huge head of wild, 
coarse, dark hair, bound by a silver 
band. Beneath the head a massive 
wrestler’s body coming up over the 
edge of the cliff, clothed in rough 
furs under a swirling dark cloak. 
On second look the figure was so 
huge the mind wanted to refuse 
belief.

T raditionally (and I’m a non- 
conformist traditionalist) the 
first column is the place the new 
columnist sets his policies in con- 
crete for the readers to stumble 
over. 

Mine is simple: The Alien View- 
point will be a stew created from 
whatever strange intellectual and 
emotional animals I come across in 
the world of science fiction and 
fantasy. 

I bagged one the other night 
around 1:30 a.m. as I was reading 
Joshua Son of None by Nancy 
Freedman (Delacorte, $7,95). 

Joshua is a clone of the late Pres- 
ident Kennedy, secretly “made” 
from a bit of tissue from the Presi- 
dent’s neck wound. 

I have reservations about the 
novel which I’ll expose elsewhere 
(reviewers are exhibitionists at 
heart). The intellectual beastie that 
attracted my attention was the 
author’s passing comment that if 
cloning was accepted by the world 
it would be possible to grow per- 
sonal clones for private organ 
banks. 

But the catch is that it would 
have to be limited to the very rich 
and the very powerful (those who 
can tap the public treasury ) and it 



would have to be very secret. 

Were I a millionaire several 
times over and were I not too old to 
wait for a clone of myself to grow 
large enough to be of use, I would 
be eager to set up a laboratory, hire 
a host womb, and have a duplicate 
of myself grown (but carefully kept 
at the imbecile level, I think) so 
that when I needed a new kidney or 
a new heart or a new set of lungs, or 
a new prostate, gall bladder . 

Of course, about every dozen 
years I’d have a new clone started. 
Perhaps if I were very rich I’d have 
back-up clones, too; insuring a 
fresh, young, strong set of organs 
and glands for my aging primary 
body. 

And you can bet your banana I’d 
promote brain transplant research. 
With that technique mastered a 
host clone could be kept available 
for emergency brain transplant as 
Well as eventual optimum-age 
transfer. 

This private use of clones would, 
again, have to be kept secret, be- 
cause there wouldn’t be doctors, 
money or resources enough to pro- 
vide everyone with sets of personal 
clones for immortality purposes. 

And there’d be all kinds of social 
ferment and envy and “morality” 



102 





involved if a rich and powerful few 
were known to be availing them- 
selves of self-grown spare parts 
which enabled them to live to be 
200 or so, at least. 

Then I speculated that maybe . 
maybe secret clones already exist. 
Have you ever wondered why 
Ronald Reagan looks so young? 
And Richard Nixon doesn’t look 60 
years old . and how ageless is 
Lena Horne, and Mae West . 



^^rwiHE story is an author-rigged 
X thing, but reality is a 100 
percent unpredictable whore.” 

— Pietro Di Donato, author of 
Christ In Concrete 



T he incredible sub-culture of 
science fiction fans and fanzines 
is alive and well despite its recent 
(and growing) exposure to pop-cul- 
ture hungry academia, especially 
since the publication in 1973 of 
Doctor Fredric Wertham’s admir- 
able The World of Fanzines: A 
Special Form of Communication by 
Southern Illinois University Press 
($ 10 ). 

It should be noted, however, that 
awareness by the professors and 
thesis hungry graduate students 
(‘Publish or die.’) is still within rea- 
son since even famous Dr. Wert- 
ham had to turn to a small univer- 
sity press, and the SIUP had to 



have the book publication subsi- 
dized by a foundation. 

The good psychiatrist did, how- 
ever, combine comic and heroic- 
fantasy fandom and fanzines with 
science fiction fandom in his over- 
flow — an act which rubbed the 
slanish fur of a few purists and 
chauvinistic s-f fan editors and 
commentators the wrong way. 

But he found us to be a Good 
Thing and gave us a clean bill of 
mental health. (If he had found us 
to be freaky escapists avoiding 
reality he would be Mud and 
described as a senile quack whose 
brain leaks precious bodily fluids.) 

I should add that Dr. Wertham’s 
favorable findings in re s-f and 
comic fans also applies to science 
fiction and fantasy readers in 
general. Have a happy day . and 
don’t be too self-conscious when 
some scholar buys the subscriber 
lists of the sf zines and sends out 
questionaires that probe your secret 
psyche. 

W HAT I intended to get at in 
this section is my admiration 
of Ed Connor and his fanatic deter- 
mination to triumph at whatever 
qpst over the U.S. Postal Service. 

Ed published a good-to-fine s-f 
fanzine in 1973 called Moebius 
Trip. Mimeographed, SVi x 11, 
three staples . the usual format. 
He wanted-to send it book rate and 
save some postage. 

The magazine qualified accord- 
ing to the P.O. rule book — except 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



103 




as interpreted by a tunnel-visioned 
official in Peoria who ruled it was 
not a book because it wasn’t bound 
like a normal printed book. 

(Ed, in a letter, reported some 
unofficial sub rosa desire by the 
Post Office to discourage this type 
of “little-mag” publishing as more 
bother to the P.O. than the postage 
is worth.) 

Anyway, Ed simmered, stewed, 
boiled, and labored in his quarters 
for a few months, and came forth 
with a fan magazine in the size and 
format of a paperback book with 
perfect binding (using the same 
spine-glue regular paperbacks use), 
even a name-change to S.F. Echo, 
published as one of a series in the 
‘Moebius Trip Library’. 

The fact that he has to spend 30 
hours per issue just to cut the 
mimeographed SVi x 14 pages into 
four 4% X 7 pages with a razor, 
then gather the 80 or more sheets to 
make one copy, then apply glue to 
the spine, and add the cover . 
this is of no matter. Extra work is 
good for the soul and he has beaten 
that stupido Post Office official. 

And he has created a ‘first’ in s-f 
fan publishing history — that format 
and binding had never been done 
before. I salute you, Ed. 

Better than that, I recommend 
readers of this column to Ed’s S.F, 
Echo #19 which contains a fine, en- 
grossing (because the author writes 
well and knows what he’s talking 
about) article by Philip Jose Farmer 
titled, “Getting A-Long With Hein- 



lein”, a must-read for Heinlein 
lovers and haters. 

Phil, also, in passing, has much 
to say about writers and writing in 
general which has that sweet, clang 
of truth so rarely found. 

There are often these gems in the 
fan press — letters and articles from 
many of the s-f pro writers, from 
well-read s-f aficionados (a twenty- 
dollar word for hard-core fans), 
and even from s-f editors and pub- 
lishers. 

We have a small, close-knit, 
friendly little world in this sub-cul- 
ture. We snap and snarl a lot — 
sometimes viciously — but overall 
s-f fandom (including many, many 
pros who started as fans) is a good

it to a well-known s-f writer who 
commented to me in a letter after 
having read Malzberg’s Herovit’s 
World which he had read after 
reading my review in The Alien 
Critic. 

Said Big Name writer doesn’t 
want to be quoted, but I can report 
that he speculated, as I did in my 
review, on the real identity of some 
of the characters in Herovit’s World 
(Random House, $4.95). 

The book is a satiric-tragic novel 
about a science fiction writer who is 
coming apart at the seams, sinking, 
lurching, staggering into progres- 
sively deeper schizophrenia. 

This character, John Steele, is 
clearly a caricature of John Camp- 
bell, Jr., and the magazine Tre- 
mendous Stories is obviously As- 
tounding/Analog. 

After that — ^the speculation is on 
shakier ground. The writer I heard 
from thinks the academic friend/ 
enemy character Wilk Mitchell is a 
disguised Kris Neville. 

It’s obviously fun to pin real 
names on these characters. In 
LOCUS #154, Dick Lupoff reviews 
Herovit’s World, too, and indulges 
in the passtime. Dick says, “The 
portraits of thinly disguised John 
W. Campbell, Jr., A. E. van Vogt 
and William Tenn are deadly.” 

In Herovit’s World Malzberg 
also does knife-numbers on science 
fiction fans, the Science Fiction 
Writers of America, Scientology

the way), and perhaps an early

THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT

writers’ group called The Futurians. 

Barry denies any resemblance to 
anyone living or dead, of course. As 
he says in his letter in The Alien 
Critic #8, “And what is Scientol- 
ogy?” 

It should be noted that strictly 
speaking, Herovit's World is not 
science fiction. It is (as the Big 
Name writer correctly noted) a con- 
temporary mainstream novel which 
is rendered of special interest to us 
because of the s-f world characters 
and the hallucinations (Herovit, 
split three ways, turns his life and 
body over to his pen-name split- 
personality first, and then, in des- 
peration, to his s-f series character. 
Mack Miller, who is head of a 
Galactic Survey Team). 

Using real s-f people in novels 
and stories has a long, noble 
history. Perhaps Bob Tucker start- 
ed it in his classic after-the-bomb 
novel The Long Loud Silence. 

Andy Offutt has done it, too, in 
Ardor On Aros, I believe, and 
Larry Niven and David Gerrold did 
a masterful job of “Tuckerizing” 
dozens of fans and pros in their The 
Flying Sorcerers of a few years ago. 

“Tuckerizing” is a private, ‘in- 
side’ thing, a way of expressing 
friendship and giving an egoboost 
to admired and respected people. 

Mostly. Sometimes it can be used 
to present deadly caricatures and 
satires — and as therapy to work out 
active dislike and maybe even 
hatred. 

S-f and fantasy artists do this 



sort of thing, too, on occasion. 
You’d be surprised at the identity 
of some of the faces that turn up on 
s-f and fantasy magazines and 
books, and in inside illustrations . 



W HAT do you consider the 
greatest weakness of Science 
Fiction today? 

Philip K. Dick: “Its inability to 
explore the subtle, intricate rela- 
tionships which exist between the 
sexes. Men, in their relationship 
with women, get themselves into 
the most goddamn difficult circum- 
stances, and s-f ignores — or is un- 
able to deal with — this funda- 
mental aspect of adult life. There- 
fore s-f remains pre-adult, and 
therefore appeals, more or less, to 
pre-adults. If s-f explored the man- 
woman aspect of life it would not 
lose its readers as those readers 
reach maturity. S-f simply must 
learn to do this or it will always 
be retarded — as it is now. The 
novel Player Piano is an exception 
to this, and I suggest that every s-f 
fan and especially every would-be 
writer study again and again the 
details of this superb novel which 
deal specifically with the relation- 
ship of the protagonist and his 
wife.’’

IF 




Sometimes, late at night, when 
Johnny Carson has a lousy guest 
list, and I’ve had too much coffee to 
go to sleep, I think thoughts that 
have no business in my head. 

A demon gets into me and I grab 
social dogma: — especially liberal so- 
cial dogma that no one questions — 
and I turn it around. 

We all know that are no taboos 
left in science fiction, don’t we? 
Why, just last week when Jim 
Baen, the new editor of If and 
Galaxy called to discuss this column 
with me he said that If was to be a 
magazine in which nothing is 
sacred. 

In Galaxy, he said, there may be 
one thou-shalt-not-touch: the prop- 
osition that humanity wpuld survive 
and would not die by our own 
hands or under the boot/hoof/ 
tentacle/claw/whatever of an alien 
menace. 

But there is a great deal of self- 
censorship in writing, and science 
fiction is as vulnerable to that kind, 
conscious and unconscious, as any 
genre of fiction or non-fiction. 

Writers automatically (after a 
few years of experience) don’t con- 
sider certain ideas, and that goes 
for editors, too. ‘Too controversial’, 
‘to perverse’, ‘too repellent’. Like 
that. 

Well, I’m going to lay some un- 
thinkable thoughts on you. Let 
them creep around on your skin for 
a few minutes before you tear them 
off and stomp them. 

What do we all reject as a bad 



thing, a regrettable tendency in hu- 
manity? How about racial preju- 
dice? How about war? 

Well, can nothing good be said 
for automatic dislike and suspicion 
of members of another race? Is 
there no value in racial prejudice’s 
brother, xenophobia — hatred of 
foreigners? 

Taking this a step farther — is 
war really bad for humanity? 

Should we abandon the fruitless 
passtime of perfecting mankind 
and instead simply accept humanity 
for what it is? We don’t much like 
ourselves as a species, do we? So 
damn many things wrong with us! 

But what if these “wrong” things 
have survival value? What if we are 
as “flawed” as we are and do such 
“terrible” things as we do (war, 
rape, murder, theft, prejudice . 
hate, greed, envy, pride ... all the 
deadly sins) because these parts 
and aspects of our nature are good 
for us as a species? 

We exist as we exist, do as we do 
(time and time again), for a reason. 
We are built this way — for war, 
strife, greed — WHY? We use rea- 
son to further emotional ends; we 
rarely use emotion to further ra- 
tional ends (as a nation, race, 
species). 

After all, God must love crimi- 
nals of all kinds since He made so 
many of them . and continues to 
maintain the social-cultural-genetic 
conditions that produce criminals, 
and suffering, and warped psyches 
of all types, and . 



THE ALIEN VIEWPOINT 



107 




But I don’t want to get into the 
God argument. It slipped in. (God- 
as-scapegoat isn’t that new an 
idea.) 

I keep coming back to the 
thought that we are as we are be- 
cause we win this way as a species. 
We rule the planet as a species. We 
purify and advance ourselves as a 
species with wars and aggressions. 

Could it possibly be that Nature’s 
Goal is: let the best racial strain 
win?; war is necessary?; genocide is 
inevitable? (Would you rather be 
half Neanderthaler and half Cro- 
Magnon?) (Is there a taint of 
Pithecanthropus in your Erectus?) 

Ah, but it is said that these 
survival-of-the-fittest leftover in- 
stincts are no longer appropriate in 
this age of extreme industrializa- 
tion/technology and interdepend- 
ence; we must cooperate or blow 
ourselves up in nuclear holocaust. 
We must curb our greed or we will 
befoul our planet to the point of 
suicide. We must, it is said, tame 
our inner beast. 

Sure. We talk a lot, preach a 
lot — but go on killing and looting. 
Could it be we’re supposed to kill 
and loot? Are we destined to war 
with and loot the galaxy? 

Would a tame, rational species 
with no emotional demons in its 
psyche, have spent the tremendous 
sums of money we have spent to get 
into space? 

Mankind did it because of “low” 
emotional reasons — pride, greed, 
power, fear. We’ll probably get to 



the stars for the same “shameful” 
reasons. 

Psychologists tell us that as indi- 
viduals we are mature if we can 
accept ourselves as we are, not as 
we feel we “should” be. But they 
don’t advise that for mankind as a 
species. 

As far as applying these specula- 
tions of mine in science fiction . 
don’t hold your water. Can you see 
a story — a novel, say — being pub- 
lished in an American s-f prozine 
with these ideas operative? Our 
virtues are our real faults, and our 
faults are our real virtues. {Pos- 
sibly. If it were good enough. Ed.) 

(I know, someone will write and 
tell me it’s been done! I’ll concede 
Frank Herbert’s Project Forty last 
year in Galaxy came close.) 

But I still think the above pre- 
mise is essentially taboo ... as fic- 
tion. In 7/*last year The Wizard of 
Anharitte by Colin Kapp started 
intriguingly, but the Good Guy 
liberal dogma won in the end — 
what a cop-out!

minded I am, send your letters care

CANTOR'S WAR 

Someone once defined an expert 
as one who never makes a mistake 
on his way to the Grand Fallacy. 

CHRISTOPHER ANVIL 



M ajor-general A. C. Hewell 
stood in the dimly lit, glassed- 
in balcony that overlooked the 
glowing white wall that illumined 
the rows of Space Force men and 
women down below at their com- 
puterized control-centers. 

Beside General Hewell stood a 
young colonel wearing a compact 
headset, who now said, “Density 
seventeen, sir. Plus one.’’ 

Hewell nodded, and one of the 
other two men in the room, a well- 
built expensively-dressed civilian, 
said, “Pardon me. General. That 
means — ’’ 

“Seventeen enemy warships per 
standard Tau-space unit. Senator. 



Which is an increase of one since 
the last reading,’’ Hewell added. 

“And the attacks usually come 
through — ’’ The Senator looked a 
question. 

“When the density is twenty-four 
or above.’’ 

“I see. Now, this large glowing 
wall-size screen before us — ’’ 

“Shows a schematic representa- 
tion of Tau-space. It’s impossible, 
of course, for a three-dimensional 
screen to represent Tau-space ac- 
curately. Roughly, this screen rep- 
resents a cross-section. The center 
stands for an arbitrary fixed point 
in Tau-space. The scale changes as 
you move from the center toward 



111 




the edge of the screen. The edge 
represents a space immeasurably 
far from the center. Enemy ships 
we show by silver dots. There are 
always enemy ships present.” 

The general turned to speak to 
the young colonel, and a moment 
later the contrast of the screen 
changed so that a multitude of sil- 
very dots could be seen, like tiny 
darting minnows, in the central 
portion of the screen. These dots 
grew rapidly smaller as the eye 
glanced out toward the edge, to 
blend into a silvery background 
that merged at last into a silver rim 
around the edge of the screen. 

“And,” said the Senator, with a 
note of profound curiosity, “with a 
density of seventeen per standard 
unit — of vo/m me? — I suppose — ” 
“That’s right. Tau-space 
volume.” 

“ — in this Tau space,’’ the 
senator went on, “with a density of 
seventeen per unit, what’s their 
total strength in there?” 

“Infinite,” said the general im- 
mediately. 

The fourth man, possibly thirty 
years old, tall, and intellectual- 
appearing, spoke for the first time, 
his voice sharp. ''Infinite?” 

The sharp questioning tone 
caused the general to turn, and the 
colonel to look up momentarily. 
“That’s right,” said the general. 
“I would question that,” said the 
fourth man, his voice sharp and 
critical, “unless you use the word 
merely in the lay sense of ‘large be- 

112 



yond our ability to measure.’” 

The general frowned, trying to 
place the peculiar quality of this 
voice. He glanced around. “You 
haven’t introduced your friend. 
Senator.” 

The senator apologized. “This is 
Dr. T. Binding Phipps, general. 
Dr. Phipps, General Hewell. Dr. 
Phipps is a mathematician and a 
former classmate of my son Alex. 
Dr. Phipps happened to be with the 
committee when your report on this 
situation was circulated; his com- 
ments on it were so pointed and so 
interesting that I thought I’d bring 
him along. Dr. Phipps and my 
daughter — ” The senator cleared 
his throat, let the sentence trail out 
unfinished so that the general 
groped for a moment after the pre- 
cise nature of the relationship im- 
plied, then shrugged. 

“Glad to have you with us. Dr. 
Phipps,” he said. 

Dr. Phipps inclined his head in 
bare acknowledgment. 

The colonel said, “Density eigh- 
teen, sir. Plus one.” 

The general nodded. 

“Might I ask,” said the senator’s 
companion abruptly, “how you de- 
termine the size of this presumed 
unit of volume?” 

The general glanced at the 
senator, who looked benevolent 
and noncommittal. 

' “1 think. Dr. Phipps,” said the 
general with careful courtesy, “that 
Colonel Smith can answer your 
question better than I.” 

IF 




The colonel glanced around. 
“What was the question again, Dr. 
Phipps?” 

“Precisely how do you determine 
the size of this presumed unit of 
volume?” 

The question came over with a 
snap suggestive of the crack of a 
whip, but the colonel, after a 
pause, answered evenly. 

“We don’t determine it. It’s a 
question of a repeated elementary 
volume that goes to make up the so- 
called ‘Tau-space.’ Another name 
for Tau-space is ‘multiple space.’ 
It’s a space that’s repeated, over 
and over.” 

“That evades my question rather 
neatly,” said Dr. Phipps, a drill- 
like note evident in his voice, 
“rather than answering it. This in- 
consistency was sufficiently obvious 
in the report.” 

The colonel blinked, the general 
frowned. The senator looked on 
blandly. 

“Perhaps,” said the general, 
“we’re working at cross-purposes 
here. There’s no question about the 
facts.” 

The colonel, noting the sharpness 
in the general’s voice and the per- 
ceptibly reddening face, said quick- 
ly, “Dr. Phipps, possibly I mis- 
understood your question. You 
asked, didn’t you, how we deter- 
mined the size — that is, volume — of 
this elementary unit when we say, 
for instance, that the density of 
enemy ships in Tau-space is seven- 
teen or eighteen?” 



“That is essentially correct.” The 
drill-like tone gave the sensation 
of biting through into a nerve. 
“And your answer manifestly evad- 
ed the issue.” 

T he general stiffened, and glanc- 
ed sharply at the senator. The 
senator said nothing, continued to 
look on benevolently. 

The colonel said carefully, ‘‘That 
depends on your meaning when you 
say ‘determine,’ Dr. Phipps. We 
dLon'i determine volume in the 
sense that we might determine a 
volume of ordinary space.” 

“Why not, if I might ask?” 

“For one thing, we can’t enter 
Tau-space. If we send a human ob- 
server through, he comes back 
spread all over the inside of the 
ship— if we’re lucky enough to get 
the ship back at all, that is. Then, 
too, we can’t readily measure the 
volume in terms of normal space 
because of certain anomolous fea- 
tures of Tau-space.” 

“Then, in short, you don’t have a 
unit volume.” 

“In terms of normal space, no. I 
can’t say the unit volume in Tau- 
space is so-many cubic light-years, 
for instance, without creating a 
false mental picture. But for our 
purposes, we have a unit volume. It 
is simply the volume of unit recep- 
tion: I’ll be happy to explain what I 
mean by that if you’re interested.” 
Dr. Phipps frowned as if uncer- 
tain whether it was worth bother- 
ing, but the senator said, “If you 



CANTOR’S WAR 



113 




would. Colonel, we’d .very much 
appreciate it.” 

The colonel said, ‘‘It’s been an 
unusual experience for us, sir, and 
it’s a little hard to grasp, even yet. 
You see, these raiders burst out to 
attack our local Space Center, rip 
up nearby cargo routes, then van- 
ished back into what was appar- 
ently subspace. Our natural re- 
action was to follow them in, track 
them through, and find out where 
they came out. With manned ships, 
as I’ve mentioned, this proved dis- 
astrous. So we tried unmanned 
ships. Each unmanned ship we sent 
in had an ident-device whose func- 
tion was simply to create a signal 
that will locate the ship. As soon as 
each of our ships went into what we 
supposed to be subspace the ident- 
display went insane. It was as if you 
tossed a glowing light-tube into a 
hall of mirrors, and got back 
images of an infinite number of 
images.” 

‘‘You mean,” Dr. Phipps inter- 
rupted patronizingly, ‘‘an indeter- 
minate number of light-tubes.” 

The general drew his breath in 
slowly, as if timing it. 

The colonel waited till the roar- 
ing went out of his ears, then said 
politely, ‘‘In this case, the ident- 
signal, which ordinarily measures 
Tau-distances by turning a needle 
over a precise distance on a dial, 
sent the needle spinning endlessly, 
as the same signal came in simul- 
taneously from an infinite number 
of positions. When I say infinite. 



that is what I mean.” 

‘‘I doubt,” said Dr. Phipps, 
“that you are professionally quali- 
fied to appreciate the meaning of 
‘infinite’.” 

There was a lengthy silence in 
which the senator, after first look- 
ing benignly at the colonel and the 
general, took out a cigar, lit it, 
continued to gaze benignly through 
a cloud of smoke. Meanwhile, the 
colonel struggled successfully not to 
do or say any of the things that it 
occurred to him to do or say, and 
finally was able to swallow and 
breathe in a more-or-less normal 
rhythm. But a certain lightheaded- 
ness warned him to stand still and 
keep his mouth shut. 

The senator, apparently to get 
the ball rolling again, said, “That’s 
interesting, colonel. I begin to get a 
picture the report didn’t give. 
Now — ” 

Dr. Phipps said, “It presents 
nothing new whatever. The picture 
this presents is so — ” 

“Now, Binding,” said the sena- 
tor chidingly, “you’re a Ph.D. and 
this is all in your field — but we 
laymen here have to potter and 
bumble around trying to find some 
handle on the thing so we can get a 
grip on it. Try to unjack yourself 
down onto our level. How are you 
going to understand how a layman 
sees these things, eh? No, when 
Colonel Smith was explaining that 
about the ident-signal, I began to 
get his point.” 

“There is no point. It would be 



114 



IF 




preposterous to assume — ” 

“Tut, tut. Binding. Are you pro- 
fessionally qualified to understand 
a layman?” 

Dr. Phipps opened his mouth, 
shut it in evident confusion. 

The colonel’s ears seemed to 
pop, and now he had the im- 
pression of being his normal self 
again. He said, “Senator, this is 
hard to explain. For one thing, we 
frankly don’t pretend to know 
what’s going on here. The effect is 
as if,' when we send a single ship 
through, it is reproduced an infin- 
ite number of times and so we de- 
tect it at an infinite number of 
positions. However, each ship is 
separately present in its own finite 
volume of space, which apparently 
remains constant — this is the 
‘volume of unit reception,’ I was 
referring to. If we send six or seven 
ships through the entire group 
appears in each unit of volume.’’ 

Dr. Phipps made as if to object, 
then hesitated in perplexity — ap- 
parently hamstrung by the thought 
that he might not really have any 
idea what thoughts were being con- 
veyed in laymen-language. 

The senator said, “And it’s an 
optical-illusion kind of thing?’’ 

“Well,’’ said the colonel, “we 
thought so at first, but we’ve dis- 
covered that by a development of 
our remote-control technique we 
can concentrate two or more of 
these identical ‘ships’ in the same 
region — which would seem impos- 
sible if they were mere reflections of 



some one basic ship. By repeating a 
sort of subspace jump within Tau- 
space, we’ve concentrated up to 
several thousand ships within one 
given unit of Tau-space.’’ 

“When,” asked the senator, 
“you’d only sent a few ships in 
there to start with?’’ 

“Yes, sir. Unbelievable as it may 
seem.’’ 

“And when you come to get them 
out — then what?’’ 

The colonel hesitated, and the 
general said, “Once we’ve gone 
through this hocus-pocus of con- 
centrating a number of ships in one 
region, we don’t get the ship out 
again.’’ 

”No ship?’’ 

“No, sir. The ships, or ‘quasi- 
images’ of ships, or whatever they 
are, apparently have to be distri- 
buted, one to each and every unit of 
Tau-space — and positioned prop- 
erly in the given units — in order for 
us to get back the original ship. 
Otherwise nothing happens; the 
ship stays in there.’’ 

“What happens to the ones that 
don’t come back?’’ 

“Well, it’s hard to say what 
would happen if we could experi- 
ment at our leisure in there. But 
that isn’t possible. There are always 
enemy ships in there, in infinite 
numbers just as ours are, and we’re 
generally heavily outnumbered, 

SO — 

”No!” Dr. Phipps put in sharply. 
The colonel shut his eyes. The 
general looked around and said 



CANTOR’S WAR 



115 




courteously, “Did you say some- 
thing, Dr. Phipps?” 

“Yes.” Dr. Phipps seemed to be 
struggling with some awkward and 
unwieldy problem — possibly that of 
projecting his meaning down to the 
lay level. “Excuse me. But you said 
that you were outnumbered. You 
said that your ships were there in 
infinite numbers, just as theirs 
were, yet you were outnumbered. ” 

“Correct. We may be outnum- 
bered twenty to one, or momen- 
tarily, it may be as close as sixteen 
to twelve. The point is, we usually 
go in there to try and find a way 
through. We don’t stick around if it 
doesn’t work — and it hasn’t yet — 
because in a very short time they 
close in on us and we get elimi- 
nated. The difficulty is that we 
don’t have enough remote-con- 
trolled ships to overpower them. 
They outnumber us. If we could 
put manned ships in there . .” 

“Oh,” said Dr. Phipps, “this 
is — this is simply — ” He cleared his 
throat, “That is not, of course, my 
special field, but surely Cantor’s 
Theorem covers this problem ade- 
quately.” 

The senator said, “Remember, 
Binding — we’re just laymen. Whose 
theorem?” 

“Cantor’s.” He cleared his 
throat. “Let me express it this way. 
If we have two infinite series — say 
the series of integers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, etc., and the series of even 
integers: 2, 4, 6, etc., and if these 
two series can be placed in one-to- 



one correspondence with each 
other, thusly — ” He pulled out a 
piece of paper, to write: 

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8... 

2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 .. 

“Then,” he added, “it follows 

that the two series are equally 
numerous, since each series can be 
continued indefinitely — forever. 

Your problem is precisely ana- 
logous.” 

There was a brief silence, then 
the colonel said, “This is Cantor’s 
Theorem?” “Well, certainly it’s a 
very elementary example — 

“But this theorem does say there 
are just as many even integers as 
there are odd and even integers 
together?” 

“That is correct.” 

The colonel took the paper, and 
wrote: 

123456789 10... 

2 4 6 8 10 . 

“This,” he said, “matches about 
the most favorable situation we’re 
usually ever in. I’d say we were out- 
numbered two-to-one, wouldn’t 
you?” 

“Not at all.” 

“We aren't?" 

“Certainly not. Any class the ele- 
ments of which may be placed in 
one-to-one correspondence with the 
elements of another class is equal in 
cardinality — that is, in numerous- 
ness — with the other class. That is 
Cantor’s Theorem.” 

The general said, “Let’s see that 
paper.” 

There was a long silence. Then 



118 



IF 




the general looked up. 

“I’ve got to admit, I don’t quite 
understand what we’re up against 
here. Now, if this theorem is 
true — ’’ 

“There’s no question at all of 
that,’’ said Dr. Phipps. “Cantor’s 
Theorem is completely accepted.’’ 
“Well, then — that gives us a way 
out of this hole.’’ 

The colonel said, “Sir. If we’re 
outnumbered two-to-dne in each 
and every one of an in finite number 
of finite regions, which is the situa- 
tion we’re up against here, I don’t 
see how it’s going to equalize 
matters for us if we juggle ships 
around from one region to an- 
other.’’ 

Dr. Phipps said, “Your error lies 
in assuming that you are outnum- 
bered.’’ 

“We are outnumbered.’’ 

“You are not.’’ 

The colonel said exasperatedly, 
“Suppose there are thirty-six of 
their ships in each unit of space, to 
only one of our ships? Surely then 
we’re outnumbered!’’ 

“Not at all. What you seek is to 
compare the series of integers with 
the series comprising every thirty- 
sixth integer. Now, from any de- 
numerable class, there may be re- 
moved a denumerably infinite num- 
ber of denumerably infinite classes, 
without affecting the cardinality of 
the class. Therefore — ’’ 

“I can’t follow that,’’ said the 
colonel exasperatedly. 

“The lay mentality,’’ said Dr. 



Phipps, “has some difficulty in 
handling the infinite and its para- 
doxes. Naturally, a certain degree 
of professional education and train- 
ing is a prerequisite.’’ 

The colonel swallowed hard, said 
nothing. 

The general said, “If they have a 
density of thirty-six ships per each 
unit of space throughout the region 
to our density of one, then we have 
as manv ships as they have?’’ 
“Certainly.’’ Dr. Phipps wrote: 

1 2 3 4 5 6 . 

36 72 108 144 180 216 . 

He held out the paper and said, 
“Since you can match the series of 
integers one-for-one with the series 
of every thirty-sixth integer, it 
follows that the two series are equal 
in respect to numerosity.’’ 

The general looked at the paper. 
“Cantor’s Theorem supports this?’’ 
“It does.’’ 

“And Cantor’s Theorem is ac- 
cepted as valid?’’ 

“Certainly.’’ 

“Well — That’s fine. What we 
run up against, you see, is that if 
our ship-density starts to approach 
theirs, they increase theirs faster 
than we can increase ours. Now if 
actually they don't outnumber us, 
we can get control in there because 
our Class I ships are individually 
superior to the enemy type of ship. 
Now, excuse me, doctor, for asking 
this next question, but a good deal 
of expensive equipment can be lost 
if we make a wrong move. Are you 
really qualified to give opinions on 



CANTOR’S WAR

the infinite as you’ve just been do- 
ing?” 

“Certainly. While this is not my 
particular special field of study, 
this has all been quite elementary.” 

“All right, I’ll take your word for 
it. We’ll try it. Colonel!" 

“Sir?” 

“Order one Class I Tau-ship set 
up to make the jump.” 

“Yes, sir.” 

The general turned to the sena- 
tor. “You’ll get a chance to see, 
Senator, just how the command- 
center here functions. And if this 
works we won’t be screaming for 
another big appropriation on this 
for quite a while.” 

R. PHIPPS finished giving his 
instructions for “matching” 
the two fleets, ship-for-ship, the 
general gazed off at the huge screen 
thoughtfully, and the senator walk- 
ed over to the colonel, and said in a 
low voice, “Do you think this is 
going to work. Colonel?” 

The colonel shrugged. “I 
couldn’t guess. The way he’s had us 
set that up, we’ve got ships coming 
on the flying jump from all over 
the place, in order to match up with 
the enemy ships at the head of that 
complex curve that he starts in the 
‘center’ of Tau-space, and then 
twists out from there to finally 
include everything else. He says we 
can match them ship-for-ship, be- 
cause we can always draw in more 
ships; , so it’s bound to come out 
even — I don’t know.” 



The senator nodded, and drew 
on his cigar. “Well, either way, we 
win.” 

“How do you figure?” 

“If he’s right, we win in Tau- 
space; one of our Class I ships will 
beat an enemy ship, won’t it?” 
“Yes, but if it doesn’t work out, 
and we’re outnumbered, then we 
lose the ship. How do we win?” 
“There are no men in this ship?” 
“No, sir. It’s unmanned.” 
“Well,” said the senator, lower- 
ing his voice, “if we lose, then T. 
Binder Phipps, Ph.D., falls flat on 
his face, and there is nothing I 
would more dearly love to see.” 
The now-familiar dental-drill 
tone bit into their conversation. 
“General, I have checked the pro- 
cedures. The matching process is 
entirely to my satisfaction. You 
may proceed at any time.” 

The senator growled, “How 
would you like to have that for a 
prospective son-in-law?” 

The colonel shivered. 

“In his natural state,” said the 
senator, “he would be bad enough. 
But the refulgent rays of glory from 
his Ph.D. are forever poking me in 
the eye, or getting stuck crosswise 
halfway down my throat.” 

The colonel glanced at the 
senator. “But suppose that Cantor 
himself was wrong.” 

The senator grinned. “That’s 
better yet. Then Binder gets to ex- 
plain how a Recognized Authority 
In The Field could make a mis- 
take.” 




118 



IF 




“Is that so impossible?’’ 

“For Binder it is. Binder is solid 
for Authority. Put him back in the 
Middle Ages and he’d chop Gali- 
leo’s head off in a minute for argu- 
ing that a heavy weight and a light 
weight fall at the same speed when 
Aristotle said otherwise. How you 
can have a Believer In Sacred 
Authority in either mathematics or 
science beats me, but the bigger a 
field gets, the more of them migrate 
in and set up shop.’’ 

The general’s voice said, “Den- 
sity, colonel?” 

“Eighteen, sir. No change.” 
“Proceed.” 

The colonel spoke briefly into his 
microphone. 

The big screen on the opposite 
wall was abruptly tinged pale-blue. 

The senator said, “That bluish 
color — ” 

The general said, “One of their 
ships creates a silvery-white appear- 
ance on the screen. One of ours, a 
blue appearance. Since we’re heav- 
ily outnumbered, the screen re- 
mains white, tinged with blue.” He 
paused. “Ah — here we go.” 



I N THE center of the screen, a 
bright blue dot had appeared, 
then put forth spiral arms, which, 
bright-blue in color, began to grow, 
then to curve in and out in a 
complex geometrical pattern that 
grew to fill up a small region at the 
center of the screen, then bend 
outward again — 



“Minus twenty,’’ said the 
colonel. 

The general said, “with a con- 
centration such as they have in 
there right now, we can only count 
on about twenty seconds, our time 
out here, till the enemy makes 
contact and starts to hit us.” 

Dr. Phipps said, “As you may 
observe, the region of one-to-one 
correspondence is expanding 
steadily.” 

It was true. In the huge, wall- 
size screen, the dark-blue area had 
now attained the proportions of a 
garbage-can lid. 

“Yes,” said. the senator, “but it 
looks to me like it’s expanding 
slower.” 

“Possibly, but only proportion- 
ately so. No limiting volume is in- 
volved. Of course, we must progres- 
sively obtain matching ships from 
further and further away. Since the 
supply is infinite, this is irrele- 
vant.” 

The colonel said, “Minus fif- 
teen.” 

The dark-blue disk now had an 
intense white ring around it, shad- 
ing off gradually to pale-blue to- 
ward the edge of the screen. 

The senator asked, “Why that 
intense white color?” 

The general, evidently concern- 
ed, said, “Those must be the 
regions our ships were moved in 
from, in order to make a match in 
the center. Dr. Phipps, I thought 
you said — ” 

Dr. Phipps said impatiently, “It 



CANTOR’S WAR 



119 




isn’t important, general. We are 
dealing with infinities. All this has 
been taken into account.” 

The intense white ring faded out 
in a series of pulses to pale-blue 
around the growing dark-blue disk. 
But as the white faded to blue 
around the disk, the blue all 
around the rim of the screen paled 
noticeably at the inside edge. The 
disk added another few inches of 
diameter, the pale-blue around it 
bleached out to white again, and 
there glowed a glaring white ring 
several times larger than before. 
The colonel said, ‘‘Minus ten.” 
“M’m,” said the general, eyeing 
the dazzling-white ring around the 
blue disk. With a series of pulses, 
the inner part of this ring, next to 
the disk, faded to pale-blue, and, 
in due course, the disk built up 
again, as elsewhere on the screen 
the pale-blue leached out every- 
where except at and near the very 
edge of the screen, and then there 
was a huge glaring region of 
dazzling white that made the disk 
in the center look smaller instead of 
bigger. 

‘‘Of course,” said the general, 
‘‘this screen gives us just a sche- 
matic representation, but — ” 

Dr. Phipps said, ‘‘Everything is 
proceeding quite satisfactorily, 
general.” 

The colonel said, ‘‘Minus five.” 
The general cleared his throat. 
‘‘Contact will almost certainly be 
established in five seconds, and fir- 
ing will begin automatically. De- 



struction of one element of the 
enemy’s force will create a yellow 
flash on the screen. A red flash will 
signify the destruction of one of our 
force.” 

The blue disk expanded. Around 
it, the white ring expanded further. 

‘‘Zero,” said the colonel. 

All around the extreme rim of 
the screen was a brief pinkish light 
as the as-yet unmatched human 
ships were destroyed. In the center, 
the blue lit with a mingling of 
yellow and red that faded out to a 
paler blue, as the individually- 
stronger human ships won out. 
Then the untouched ring of daz- 
zling white squeezed in with a red- 
dish glare that ate straight to the 
center of the blue disk, then faded 
out to leave one solid bright sil- 
very-whiteness on the screen from 
end to end. 

The general turned around and 
looked at Dr. Phipps. 

The senator shook his head. 
‘‘Well, general, I see that method 
won’t beat them. I’ll relate this in- 
cident to the committee when we 
get back.” 

Dr. Phipps said, ‘‘I— -I don’t — ” 

The others waited for him to go 
on, but he only stared at the blank 
white screen, from which the blue 
had been wiped off with ridiculous 
ease. 

The colonel turned and glanced 
at the general. ‘‘If I might ask Dr. 
Phipps a few questions, sir.” 

‘‘Go right ahead.” 

‘‘Dr. Phipps,” said the colonel. 



120 



IF 




“in this matching procedure — you 
take a unit in one series, move it up 
to match it to one in the other 
series, and when you have a method 
by which you can match them one 
for one, you say they’re equal, 
right?” 

Phipps drew in a long ragged 
breath. 

“That is correct.” 

“But at any given time, the 
matched parts of the two series are 
finite, aren’t they? The parts of the 
series of digits, and the series of 
even digits, for instance, that you 
used as an example. Even after 
you’ve matched a million, a billion, 
or a quintillion terms, still, the part 
that’s matched finite, isn’t it?” 

“I — this is not — Well, I suppose 
that is correct.” 

“Then you’re determining the 
comparative sizes of two infinite 
series by taking a finite end of 
each?” 

“Ah—” 

“And then, since the finite ends 
of each — which are always insig- 
nificant compared to the rest of the 
series — since these finite ends 
match, then you say the infinite re- 
mainders, which you haven't com- 
pared, but have only drawn num- 
bers from — you say therefore they 
must be the same size, too? Is that 
right?” 

Phipps mopped his forehead. 
“Ah — I’m afraid the difficulty is 
that the matching process must run 
on infinitely — then each of the two 
matched ends is infinite in length.” 



“Nevertheless, there remains the 
other end, that isn't matched, from 
which you’re still drawing numbers 
for the matched end of the series. 
The procedure you use to match the 
series only matches one end, doesn’t 
it?” 

Dr. Phipps grappled with this 
problem, and a lengthy silence 
followed. 

The colonel said, “Now, Dr. 
Phipps, just to clear the thing up. 
I’d like to ask you if this same 
matching method could be used, 
for example, to compare an infinite 
number of spaceships with an in- 
finite number of pilots, assuming 
that exactly one-half of all the ships 
have a pilot, and the other half of 
the ships have no pilot. Could we 
use Cantor’s method to find out 
whether there are more pilots or 
spaceships?" 

“Yes. Yes, we could. Very 
easily.” 

“All right. Every alternate ship 
has a pilot locked inside. How do 
we use the method?” 

“Well, we — ah — we line up the 
ships, and then we line the pilots up 
right beside them, one-for-one, 
which shows that there are an equal 
number of ships and pilots.” 

“Only every other ship has a 
pilot, but when we use this method, 
they come out even?” 

“That is correct. There is a 
one-to-one correspondence.” 

“In other words, we match pilots 
to ships, by putting a pilot in the 
second ship in the line, for instance. 



CANTOR’S WAR 



121 




using a pilot we took from further 
back somewhere?” 

“Yes. We put pilots in the sec- 
ond, fourth, sixth, and eighth 
ships, and so on, to get a one-to-one 
correspondence between ships and 
pilots.” 

“All right. Let’s go back to this 
first pilot that you put on the 
number two ship. Where did you 
get him?” 

“Ah—” 

“Remember, one-half of the 
ships have pilots, locked inside, 
one-half have no pilots at all. There 
are no loose pilots lying around. 
You had, to get the pilot some- 
where.” 

“Yes. I see.” 

“Now, when you put a pilot in 
ship number two, to start this one- 
to-one correspondence, where do 
you get him from?” 

“I — ah — I took him from some 
ship somewhere else.” 

“So you take the pilot out of a 
piloted ship?” 

“Yes.” 

“And you use that pilot to pilot 
ship number 2?” 

“Yes. Exactly.” 

“Then, all you do is move the 
pilot around. Obviously, no matter 
how you switch the pilots around, if 
every time you put one pilot into a 
ship, here, you have to get him by 
taking one pilot out of a ship there, 
then there’s no change in the over- 
all ratio of piloted to unpiloted 
ships.” 

Phipps blinked. “Let’s see 



now . That would seem to be 
correct . Yes. That is correct. 
Obviously, no matter how the pilots 
are transferred, there remain just 
as many unpiloted ships as piloted 
ones. Because, every time we put a 
pilot in one ship, we first take a 
pilot out of another ship. This is 
perfectly clear. The ratio of pilots 
to ships remains constant, overall. 
Necessarily, taking the entire region 
into account, that ratio \s fixed?" 

“Then,” said the colonel, “we’ve 
just shown that there are always as 
many unpiloted as piloted ships or, 
in other words, two ships for each 
pilot, or twice as many ships as 
pilots. Yet, with Cantor’s method, 
you say you can ‘prove’ the number 
of ships and pilots to be equal. 
After setting up a procedure to 
match one pilot to each ship at the 
head end of the line, and inciden- 
tally piling up a lot of empty ships 
in the other end of the line, then 
you claim that the nonrepresenta- 
tive, stacked-deck condition you’ve 
set up in the front end also holds in 
the other part — which you have 
only looted and never counted — 
and on this basis you claim that you 
have compared the two series as a 
whole, and thus can ‘prove’ that 
they are equal. By matching one 
pilot to each ship at one end, you 
‘prove’ there are as many pilots as 
ships. But, all the time, you’re 
getting these extra pilots by empty- 
ing hosts of ships, which empty 
ships accumulate exactly fast 
enough to maintain the ratio of two 



122 



IF 




ships for each pilot, but you inten- 
tionally don’t count these empty 
ships. You call this a valid 
method?” 

There was a lengthy silence. 

Finally Phipps said hollowly, “I 
thought when I first heard it that 
there was something I didn’t grasp 
about this method. But I knew if 
such an authority as Dr. Cantor 
used the method, it must be 
correct. I was puzzled, but — if I’d 
asked questions, it might have 
seemed that I didn’t understand. 
I — I wanted to succeed, so I kept 
my mouth shut. And then — ” Sud- 
denly he seemed to hear how all this 
sounded, and abruptly stopped 
talking. 

The general said curiously, “You 
‘wanted to succeed,’ so you ‘kept 
your mouth shut’?” 

The senator cleared his throat, 
but after a momentary pause 
Phipps went on more confidently. 
“Of course, it must just be that Dr. 
Cantor himself really means some 
other thing by this method than 
what we meant here. Yet I’m 
certain that was the sense of it as it 
was taught us — and as I’ve seen it 
elsewhere, many times.” 

The general said, “Maybe a few 
other people wanted to succeed, 
and kept their mouths shut when 
the thing wasn’t clear to them 
either.” 

“And,” said the senator blandly, 
“in due time got their Ph.D.’s and 
are now infallible Authorities In 
The Field.” 



Phipps winced, then moodily 
hauled himself erect and looked 
defiant. 

The general shrugged. “Well, 
the damage is done. Senator, I 
think we can stop any serious 
breakout here. Naturally, in normal 
space, we can use our advantage in 
manned ships, and as both sides — 
again, in normal space — have only 
a finite number of ships, we can 
handle them. But it means we’re 
tied up here to prevent a breakout. 
And we can’t follow them back and 
finish them until we can send a 
superior force into Tau-space after 
them.” 

The senator nodded pleasantly. 
“I understand, now, general, and I 
think you’ve proved your point con- 
vincingly. I’ll say so to the commit- 
tee. Well, we’ll be going.” The cor- 
ner of his mouth lifted in an odd 
smile. “Come along. Binding, my 
boy. We’ll have to tell Marylou all 
about our adventure when we get 
back, won’t we?” 

The two men went out, the one 
sunk in gloom, the other genial and 
expansive. 

The general glanced at the 
colonel. 

“What the deuce was he so 
happy about? Does he like de- 
feats?” 

The colonel shook his head. 

“I got the impression, sir, that a 
certain prospective family-member 
has had him a bit up-tight — he 
thinks he’s succeeded in loosening 
up a Binding relationship.” •

AURA OF 
IMMORTALITY 

Better by far to enter 
a den of serpents 
than a scientist’s laboratory 
uninvited! 




JAMES H. SCHMITZ 



C OMMISSIONER Holati Tate had 
been known to state on ac- 
casion that whenever there was a 
way for Professor Mantelish to get 
himself into a mess of trouble, 
Mantelish would find it. 

When, therefore, the Commis- 
sioner, while flicking through a 
series of newscasts, caught a mo- 
mentary view of Mantelish chatting 
animatedly with a smiling young 
woman he stopped the instrument 
instantly, and with a touch of ap- 
prehension spun it back to locate 
the program in question. The last 
he had heard of Mantelish, the 
professor had been on a govern- 
ment-sponsored expedition to a far- 



off world, from which, the Com- 
missioner had understood, he 
would not be returning for some 
time. However, Commissioner Tate 
had just got back to Maccadon 
from an assignment himself; for all 
he knew Mantelish might have 
changed his plans. Indeed, it would 
seem he had. 

He caught the program again, 
clicked it in. One good look at the 
great, bearlike figure and the mane 
of thick white hair told him it was 
indeed his old friend Mantelish. 
The dainty lady sitting across the 
table from Mantelish was a profes- 
sional newscaster. The background 
was the Ceyce spaceport on Mac- 



125 




cad on. The professor evidently had 
just come off his ship. 

His sense of apprehension deep- 
ening, Commissioner Tate began to 
listen sharply to what was being 
said. 

P ROFESSOR Mantelish ordinarily 
was allergic in the extreme to 
newscasters and rebuffed their ef- 
forts to pump him about his pro- 
jects with such heavy sarcasm that 
even the brashest did not often 
attempt to interview him on a live 
show. On the other hand he was 
highly susceptible to pretty women. 
When a gorgeous little newshen 
spotted him among the passengers 
coming off a spaceliner at Ceyce 
Port and inquired timidly whether 
he would answer a few questions for 
her viewers, the great scientist sur- 
prised her no end by settling down 
for a friendly fifteen- minute chat 
during which he reported on his 
visit to the little-known planet of 
the Tang from which he had just 
returned. 

It was a fine scoop for the little 
newshen. Professor Mantelish’s ex- 
ploits and adventures were a legend 
in the Hub and he was always good 
copy — when he could be persuaded 
to talk. On this occasion, further- 
more, he had something to tell 
which was in itself of more than a 
little interest. The Tang — who 
could be called a humanoid species 
only if one were willing to stretch a 
number of points — had been con- 
tacted by human explorers some 



decades before. They tended to be 
ferociously hostile to strangers and 
had a number of other highly un- 
pleasant characteristics; so far little 
had become known of them beyond 
the fact that they were rather primi- 
tive creatures living in small, foot- 
loose tribes on a cold and savage 
planet. 

Professor Mantelish, however, 
had spent several months among 
them, accompanied by a team of 
specialists with whose help he had 
cracked the language barrier which 
previously had prevented free com- 
munication with the Tang. He had 
made copious recordings of th^ir 
habits and customs, had even been 
permitted to bring back a dead 
Tang embalmed by freezing as was 
their practice. From the scientific 
viewpoint this was a very valuable 
specimen, since the Tang appeared 
to die only as a result of accident, 
murder, or in encounters with 
ferocious beasts. They did not 
suffer from diseases and had de- 
veloped a means of extending their 
natural life span almost indefi- 
nitely . 

The young newscaster latched on 
to that statement like a veteran. 
Wide-eyed and innocent she slip- 
ped in a few leading questions and 
Mantelish launched into a detailed 
explanation. 

It had taken some months before 
he gained the confidence of the 
Tang sufficiently to induce them to 
reveal their secret: they distilled the 
juice of a carefully tended and 



126 



IF 




guarded plant through an involved 
procedure. The drug they obtained 
in this way brought about a reversal 
of the normal aging process so that 
they retained their youthful health 
and vigor for a length of time 
which, though it had not been pre- 
cisely determined, the Tang regard- 
ed as “forever”. 



C OULD this drug, the little news- 
hen asked, perhaps be adapted 
for human use? 

Mantelish said he could not be 
definite about that, but it seemed 
quite possible. While the Tang had 
not let the members of his expedi- 
tion know what plant they culti- 
vated for the purpose, they had ob- 
ligingly presented him with several 
liters of the distilled drug for ex- 
perimentation which he had 
brought back with him. Analysis of 
the drug while still on the Tang 
planet had revealed the presence of 
several heretofore unknown forms 
of protein with rather puzzling 
characteristics; the question was 
whether or not these could be 
reproduced in the laboratory. To 
settle the question might well take a 
number of years — it could not of 
course be stated at present what the 
long-term effect of the drug on 
human beings would be. It was, 
however, apparently harmless. He 
and several other members of his 
group had been injected with sig- 
nificant quantities of the drug while 
on the planet, and had suffered no 
ill effects. 



Big-eyed again, the newscaster 
inquired whether this meant that 
he, Professor Mantelish, was now 
immortal? 

No, no, Mantelish said hastily. 
In humans, as in the Tang, the 
effects of a single dose wore off in 
approximately four months. To 
retain youth, or to bring about the 
gradual rejuvenation of an older 
body, it was necessary to repeat the 
dosage regularly at about this inter- 
val. The practice of the Tang was to 
alternately permit themselves to 
age naturally for about ten years, 
then to use the drug for roughly the 
same length of time or until youth- 
fulness was restored. 

To protect both the Tang and 
their miracle plant from illegal ex- 
ploitation, the Federation, follow- 
ing his initial report on the matter, 
was having the space about the 
planet patrolled. What the final 
benefits of the discovery to hu- 
manity would be was still open to 
question. It was, however, his 
personal opinion that the Tang 
drug eventually would take its place 
as a very valuable addition to the 
various rejuvenation processes cur- 
rently being employed in the 
Hub . 

“The old idiot!” Commissioner 
Holati Tate muttered to himself. 
He swung around, found a red- 
headed young woman standing be- 
hind him, large, gray eyes intently 
watching the screen. “Did you hear 
all that. Trigger?” he demanded. 

“Enough to get the idea,”

Trigger said. “I came in as soon as 
I recognized the profs voice . 
After those remarks, he’d be safer 
back among the Tang! He doesn’t 
even seem to have a bodyguard 
around.” 

Commissioner Tate was dialing a 
ComWeb number. ‘T’ll call the 
spaceport police! They’ll give him 
an escort. Hop on the other Com- 
Web and see his home and lab are 
under guard by the time he gets 
there.” 

“I just did that,” Trigger said. 

“Then see if you can make an 
emergency contact with that news- 
caster female before Mantelish 
strays off . .” 

Trigger shook her head. “I tried 
it. No luck! It’s a floating pro- 
gram.” 

She watched the final minute 
and a half of the newscast, biting 
her lip uneasily, while the Commis- 
sioner made hasty arrangements 
with the spaceport police. To hear 
Professor Mantelish blabbing out 
the fact that he might have the 
answer to man’s search for immor- 
tality in his possession was discon- 
certing. It was an open invitation to 
all the criminal elements currently 
on Maccadon to try to get it from 
him. The prof simply shouldn’t be 
allowed to wander around without 
tactful but efficient nursemaiding! 
Usually, she or Holati or somebody 
else made sure he got it, but they’d 
assumed that on a Federation ex- 
pedition he’d be kept out of 
jams . 



When the Commissioner had 
finished,- she switched off the news- 
cast, said glumly, “You missed 
something, Holati. Mantelish just 
showed everybody watching on 
umpteen worlds the container he’s 
got that drug in!” 

“The Tang stuff?” 

“Yes. It’s in that round sort of 
suitcase he had standing beside his 
chair.” 

The Commissioner swore. 

“Come along!” he said. “We’ll 
take my car and head for the 
spaceport. The police weren’t sure 
from exactly where that newscast 
was coming but if they catch up 
with Mantelish before he leaves 
they’ll wait for us and we’ll ride in 
to his lab with him.” 

“And if they don’t?” 

“They’ll call the car. Then we’ll 
go to the lab and wait for him to 
show up.” 

ALMOST as soon as he’d bid the 
charming little newscaster 
goodbye. Professor Mantelish him- 
self began to feel some qualms 
about the revelations he’d allowed 
to escape. He began to realize he 
might have been a trifle indiscreet. 
Walking on with the crowds moving 
towards the spaceport exit hall, he 
found himself growing acutely con- 
scious of the Tang drug container 
in the suitcase he carried. Normally 
preoccupied with a variety of 
matters of compelling scientific 
interest, it was almost impossible 
for him to conceive of himself as 



128 



IF 




being in personal danger. Neverthe- 
less, now that his attention was 
turned on the situation he had 
created it became clear that many 
people who had watched the news- 
cast might feel tempted to bring the 
drug into their possession, either 
for selfish reasons or out of perhaps 
excessive zeal for private re- 
search . 

The average citizen at this point 
might have started looking around 
for the nearest police officer. Pro- 
fessor Mantelish, however, was of 
independent nature; such a solu- 
tion simply did not occur to him. 
He had advertised the fact that he 
was headed for his laboratory. That 
had been a mistake. Therefore he 
would not go there — which should 
foil anyone who was presently en- 
tertaining illegal notions about the 
Tang drug. Instead, he would take 
himself and the drug immediately 
to a little seaside hideout he main- 
tained which was known only to his 
closest associates. Once there he 
could take steps to have the drug 
safeguarded. 

Satisfied with this decision Man- 
telish lengthened his stride. About 
a hundred yards ahead was the 
entry to an automatic aircar rental 
station. As he came up half a dozen 
people turned into it in a group, ob- 
viously harmless citizens. Mantelish 
followed them in, moved over to the 
wair just inside the entry, turned 
and stood waiting, prepared, if 
required, to swing the weighted 
suitcase he held under his flowing 



robe like an oversized club. But 
half a minute passed and no one 
else came in. Satisfied, he hurried 
after the little group, catching up 
with them just as they reached the 
line of waiting cars and climbed 
into a car together, laughing and 
joking. Mantelish got into the car 
behind them, deposited a five-credit 
piece. The cars began to move for- 
wards, rose toward the exit. He 
glanced back to make sure again 
that no one was following, placed 
the Tang container on the floor- 
boards beside him, snapped the 
car’s canopy shut and put his hands 
on the controls. 

The aircars emerged from the fif- 
teenth floor of the spaceport exit 
building, the lights of Ceyce glitter- 
ing under its night-screen before 
them. Mantelish turned immedi- 
ately to the left, directed the car up 
to one of the main traffic lines, 
moved along it for a minute, then 
shifted abruptly to one of the upper 
high-speed lanes. 

H e reached his hideaway a 
scant fifteen minutes later. It 
was in a residential shore area, fea- 
turing quiet and privacy. The house 
overlooked a shallow, sheltered 
ocean bay, was built on sloping 
ground thirty feet above tide level. 
It was a pleasant place, fit for an 
elderly retired man of remarkable 
habits. None of Mantelish’s neigh- 
bors knew him by name or sus- 
pected he maintained a laboratory 
within his walls — an installation in 



AURA OF IMMORTALITY 



129 




absolute violation of the local zon- 
ing regulations. 

He locked the entry door behind 
him, crossed a hall, opened the 
door to the laboratory. He stood 
motionless a moment, looking 
around. Everything was as he had 
left it months before, kept spotless- 
ly clean by automatic maintenance 
machinery. He went over to a table 
on which lay a variety of items, the 
results of projects he had hastily 
completed or left incompleted be- 
fore setting- out on the expedition to 
the Tang world. He put the Tang 
container on the table between a 
chemical gun and a packaged de- 
vice which, according to the in- 
structions attached to it, was a 
mental accelerator with a ratio of 
two hundred and eighty to one, 
instantly lethal if used under condi- 
tions other than those specified in 
the instructions. He looked about 
once more, went out by another 
door to the kitchen of the house. 

A minute or two later, he heard 
the laboratory Com Web buzzing 
shrilly. Mantelish glanced around 
from the elaborate open-face sand- 
wiches he was preparing. He frown- 
ed. Among the very few people who 
knew the number of that Com- 
Web, only two were at all likely to 
be calling him at this moment. One 
was Commissioner Tate, the other 
was Trigger Argee. If either of 
them — Trigger, in particular — had 
caught the newscast at the space- 
port just now they were going to 
give him hell. 



His frown deepened. Should he 
ignore the call? No, he decided; 
however unnecessarily, the caller 
was no doubt concerned about his 
safety. He must let them know he 
was all right. 

Mantelish lumbered hurriedly 
back into the laboratory, came to a 
sudden stop just beyond the door. 
There were two men there. One was 
seated at the table where he had 
put down the Tang container; the 
other leaned against the wall beside 
the hall door. Both held guns, which 
at the moment were pointed at him. 

Mantelish looked from one to the 
other, lifting his eyebrows. This, he 
told himself, was a most unfortu- 
nate situation. He knew the pair 
from a previous meeting, the con- 
clusion of which had been marked 
by a certain amount of physical vio- 
lence. He didn’t like the look of the 
guns but perhaps he could bluff it 
out. 

“Fiam,” he said with stern dig- 
nity to the man at the table, “I am 
not at all pleased by your intrusion. 
I thought I had made it clear to you 
last year when I threw you out of 
my laboratory that there was no 
possibility of our doing business. If 
I failed, I shall make the point very 
clear indeed immediately after I 
have answered this call!” 

He turned toward the clamoring 
ComWeb. Suddenly he felt an ex- 
cruciating pain in his left leg, 
centered on the kneecap. He grunt- 
ed, stopped. 

“That’s enough for now, Welk,” 



130 



IF 




Paes Fiam said lazily from the 
table. “He’s got the idea ...” 

The pain faded away. The man 
standing by the door grinned and 
lowered his gun. Fiam went on, 
“Sit down over there, professor — 
across from me. Forget the Com- 
Web. This shouldn’t take long. 
These guns of ours, as you’ve 
noticed, can be very painful. They 
can also kill very quickly. So let’s 
not have any unpleasantness.’’ 

Mantelish scowled at him but sat 
down. “Why have you come here?’’ 
he demanded. 

Fiam smiled. “To ask you for a 
small favor. And a little informa- 
tion.’’ He picked up the chemical 
gun lying on the table beside the 
Tang container, looked at it a mo- 
ment. “This device,’’ he said, “ap- 
pears to be something you’ve devel- 
oped.’’ 

“It is,’’ Mantelish said. 

“What’s so remarkable about 
it?’’ 

Mantelish snorted. “It kills the 
intended victim immediately on 
spray contact while placing the user 
in no danger whatsoever, even 
when carelessly handled.’’ 

“So the label says,’’ Paes Fiam 
agreed. “A one to four foot range. 
Very interesting!’’ He laid the gun 
back on the table. “I find it a little 
strange, professor, that a man 
holding the high ethical principles 
you outlined to me in our previous 
conversation should devote his time 
to creating such a murderous little 
weapon!’’ 



Mantelish snorted again. “What 
I am willing to create depends on 
the clients with whom I am dealing. 
I would not place such weapons in 
the hands of common crooks like 
yourselves.’’ 

The Com Web’s noise stopped. 
Fiam smiled briefly, said, “Not 
common crooks. Professor Mante- 
lish. We happen to be exceptionally 
talented and efficient crooks. As 
the present situation demon- 
strates.’’ 

“What do you mean?’’ Mantelish 
asked’ coldly. 

“I happened to be at the Ceyce 
spaceport,’’ Fiam said, “while you 
were bragging about your Tang im- 
mortality drug on the newscast. I 
took steps immediately to make 
sure I knew where you went. Welk 
and I followed you here without 
very much trouble. We made sure 
in the process that nobody else was 
tailing you.’’ He patted the Tang 
container. “This is what we’re 
after, professor! And we’ve got it.’’ 
“You are being very foolish,’’ 
Mantelish said. “As I indicated 
during the newscast, it remains 
questionable whether the Tang 
drug can be produced under labo- 
ratory conditions. If it is possible, it 
will involve years of research. at the 
highest level. I — ’’ 

“Hold it, professor!’’ Fiam raised 
his hand, nodded at Welk. “Your 
statements are very interesting, but 
let’s make sure you’re not attempt- 
ing to mislead us.’’ 

“Mislead you?’’ Mantelish rum- 



AURA OF IMMORTALITY 



131 




bled indignantly. 

“You might, you know. But 
Welk will now place the pickup of a 
lie detector at your feet. Sit very 
still while he’s doing it — you know I 
can’t miss at this range.’’ ^ Fiam 
brought a small instrument out of 
his pocket, placed it on the table 
before him. “This is the detector’s 
indicator,’’ he went on. “A very de- 
pendable device, every time it 
shows me you’re being less than 
truthful you’ll get an admonishing 
jolt from Welk’s gun. Welk’s never 
really forgiven you for not opening 
the lab door before you ejected him 
last year. Better stick to the truth, 
professor!’’ 

“I have no intention of lying,’’ 
Mantelish said with dignity. 

Paes Fiam waited until Welk had 
positioned the pickup and stepped 
back, went on. “Now, professor, 
you were suggesting that at present 
the Tang drug has no commercial 
value . .’’ 

Mantelish nodded. “Exactly! 
The quantity on the table here — 
and it’s every drop of the drug to be 
found off the Tang w^rld now — is 
not nearly enough to be worth the 
risk you’d be taking in stealing and 
trying to market it. It might extend 
the life of one human being by a 
very considerable extent, and that 
is all. And what potential client 
would take your word for it that it 
would do that — or that it wouldn’t, 
for that matter, harm him instead, 
perhaps kill him within a few 
months?’’ 



“A large number of potential 
clients would, if they were desperate 
enough for life,’’ Fiam said, watch- 
ing the detector indicator. “You 
were skirting the f^rrnges of decep- 
tion with that question, professor. 
But that’s not the point. Does the 
drug have harmful physical or 
mental effects?’’ 

Mantelish said, “A calculated 
quantity was given to six members 
of our expedition, including myself. 
During the past four months, no 
harmful physical or mental effects 
have been observed, and the overall 
effect has worn off again. That’s all 
I can say.’’ 

“And the Tang drug did have a 
rejuvenating effect on these human 
subjects?’’ 

Mantelish hesitated, admitted, 
“A slight but measurable one. That 
was in accordance with our expec- 
tations.’’ 

Fiam smiled. “I see. What other 
expectations did you have in con- 
nection with the use of the drug on 
human beings?’’ 

Mantelish said reluctantly, “That 
the dosage given human subjects 
would wear out of the system in 
about four months — as it did. And 
that if the rejuvenation effect were 
to continue the treatment would 
therefore have to be repeated regu- 
larly at four-month intervals.’’ 

“What do you believe will happen 
if that is done?’’ 

“Within a ten-year period,’’ 
Mantelish said, “the subject should 
find that his biological age has not 



132 



IF 




advanced but has been reduced by 
about five years. The Tang reju- 
venation process is a slow, steady 
one. The Tang themselves select 
the biological age they prefer, and 
remain within a few years of it by a 
judicious use of the drug. It is, of 
course, impossible to reduce the 
biological age beyond late adoles- 
cence.” 

“I understand,” Fiam said. “And 
how is the drug administered?” 
“The Tang drink the extract,” 
Mantelish said. “On human beings 
it has a violently nauseating effect 
when administered in that form. 
We found it more practical to 
administer a subcutaneous injec- 
tion.” 

“There’s nothing essentially dif- 
ferent between that and any other 
subcutaneous injection?” 

“No, none at all.” 

Paes Fiam patted the container 
again, smiled, said, “The drug ex- 
tract in here is ready to be used 
exactly as it is?” 

“Yes.” 

“Are there any special measures' 
required to preserve its usefulness 
and harmlessness indefinitely?” 
“It’s self-preserving,” Mantelish 
said. “There should be no signifi- 
cant difference in its properties 
whether it’s used today or after a 
century. But as I have pointed out, 
I cannot and will not say that it is 
harmless. A test on six subjects is 
by no means definitive. The seventh 
one might show very undesirable 
physical reactions. Or undesirable 



reactions might develop in the six 
who have been tested five, or ten, or 
fifteen years from now ...” 

“No doubt,’’ Fiam said. He 
smacked his lips lightly. “Be care- 
ful how you answer my next ques- 
tion. You said the drug in this con- 
tainer should extend the life of one 
human being very considerably. 
What does that mean in standard 
years?” 

Mantelish hesitated, said grudg- 
ingly, “My estimate would be about 
three hundred years. That is an ap- 
proximation.” 

Fiam grinned happily at Welk. 
“Three hundred years, eh? That’s 
good enough for us, professor! As 
you may have begun to surmise, 
we’re the clients for whom the drug 
is intended. We have no intention 
of trying to sell it. And we’ll take a 
chance on undesirable reactions 
showing up in five or ten years 
against the probability of another 
hundred and fifty years of interest- 
ing and profitable living!” 

He stood up, moved back from 
the table. “Now then, you’ve got 
the equipment to administer a sub- 
cutaneous injection somewhere 
around the lab. You’ll get it out 
while I keep this gun on you. You’ll 
show Welk exactly what you’re 
doing, describe the exact amount of 
drug that is required for each injec- 
tion. And you’ll do all that while 
you’re within range of the lie de- 
tector. So don’t make any mistakes 
at this stage or, believe me, you’ll 
get hurt abominably!

133 




“Finally, you’ll give me the ini- 
tial four-month injection. I shall 
then give Welk an identical injec- 
tion under your supervision. After 
that, we’ll just wrap up the con- 
tainer with the rest of the drug and 
be on our way ...” 



T en minutes later Mantelish sat 
at the table, gloomily watching 
Fiam store the container, along 
with several other of the finished 
products on the table which had 
caught his fancy, into the suitcase. 
Welk stood behind the professor’s 
chair, gun pointed at Mantelish’s 
neck. 

“Now let me give you the rest of 
the story on this, professor,’’ Fiam 
said. He picked up Mantelish’s 
chemical gun, looked at it and 
placed it on top of the suitcase. 
“You’ve mentioned several times 
that I can’t expect to get away with 
this. Let me reassure you on the 
point. 

“For one thing, we set up a tem- 
poral scrambler in this room as 
soon as we came in. It’s on one of 
those shelves over there. It will re- 
main there and continue in action 
for thirty minutes after we’ve left, 
so no one will be able to restructure 
the events of the past few hours and 
identify us in that way. We’re wear- 
ing plastiskin gloves, of course, and 
we haven’t made any foolish mis- 
takes to give investigators other 
leads to who might have been here. 
“Also we enjoy — under other 



names — an excellent reputation on 
this planet as legitimate business- 
men from Evalee. Should foul play 
be suspected, we, even if somebody 
should think of us, certainly will 
not be suspected of being involved 
in it. As a matter of fact’’ — Fiam 
checked his watch — “twenty 
minutes from now, we shall be at- 
tending a gay social function in 
Ceyce to which we have been 
invited. As far as anybody could 
prove, we’ll have spent all evening 
there.’’ 

He smiled at Mantelish. “One 
more thing; you will be found dead 
of course; but there will be some 
question about the exact manner in 
which you died. We shall leave an 
interesting little mystery behind us. 
The Tang container will be missing. 
But why is it missing? Did you 
discover, or fancy you had discov- 
ered, some gruesome reaction to 
the drug in yourself, and drop it out 
over the sea so no one else would be 
endangered by it? Did you then 
perhaps commit suicide in prefer- 
ence to waiting around for the 
inevitable end?” 

“Suicide — pfah!” growled Man- 
telish. “No one is lunatic enough to 
commit suicide with a pain-stimu- 
lant gun!” 

“Quite right,” Fiam agreed. He 
took up the professor’s chemical 
gun from the suitcase again. “I’ve 
been studying this little device of 
yours. It functions in a quite simple 
and obvious manner. This sets the 
triggering mechanism — correct? It

is now ready to fire.” He pointed 
the gun at Mantelish, added, 
“Stand aside, Welk.” 

Welk moved swiftly four feet to 
one side. Mantelish’s eyes widened. 
“You wouldn’t — ” 

“But I would,” Fiam said. And 
as the professor started up with a 
furious bellow, he pulled the 
trigger. 

Mantelish’s body went rigid, his 
face contorting into a grisly grin. 
He thumped sideways down on the 
table, rolled off it on the side away 
from Fiam, went crashing down to 
the floor. 

“Ugh!” Welk said, staring down 
in fascinating incredulity. “His 
whole face has turned blue!” 

“Is he dead?” Fiam inquired, 
peering over the table. 

“I never saw anyone look deader! 
Or bluer!” Welk reported shakenly. 

“Well, don’t touch him! The 
stuff might hit you even through 
the gloves.” Fiam came around the 
table, laid the gun gingerly on the 
floor, said, “Shove it over by his 
hand with something. Then we’ll 
get ourselves lost ...” 

The ComWeb was shrilling again 
as they went out into the hall, 
closed the door behind them. After 
it stopped the laboratory and the 
rest of Mantelish’s house was quiet 
as a tomb. 

A miracle,” Trigger said, 
i“that you’re still alive!” She 
looked pale under her tan. The pro- 
fessor had lost the bright cerAilean 



tint Welk had commented on by 
the time she and Commissioner 
Tate came rushing into the house a 
minute or two ago. The skin of his 
face was now a nasty green through 
which patches of his normal weath- 
ered-brick complexion were just be- 
ginning to show. 

“No miracle at all, my dear,” 
Mantelish said coolly. “Paes Fiam 
has encountered the kind of misfor- 
tune the uninformed layman may 
expect when he ventures to chal- 
lenge the scientist on his own 
ground. He had lost the game, 
literally, at the moment he stepped 
into this laboratory! I had half a 
dozen means at my disposal here to 
foil his criminal plans. Since I was 
also in the laboratory at the time, 
most of them might have been 
harmful — or at least extremely dis- 
agreeable — to me. So as soon as I 
saw he intended to use the chemical 
gun, I decided to employ that 
method to rid myself of his pre- 
sence.” 

Commissioner Tate had been 
studying the gun’s label. 

"'This says the gun kills instant- 
ly,” he observed. 

“It does kill instantly,” Mante- 
lish said, “if aimed at an attacking 
Rumlian fire roach. I designed it to 
aid in the eradication of that noi- 
some species. On the human organ- 
ism it has only a brief paralyzing 
effect.” 

“It makes you look revolting, 
too!” Trigger said, studying him 
fascinatedly.

“A minor matter, my dear. 
Within an hour or two I shall have 
regained my normal appearance.” 

Holati Tate sighed, placed the 
gun back on the table. “Well we 
should be able to pick up your 
friends since we know who they 
are,” he said. “I’ll alert the space- 
ports immediately and get Scout 
Intelligence on the job. We’re lucky 
though that they didn’t get more of 
a head start.” 

Mantelish held up his hand. 
“Please don’t concern yourself 
about the Tang drug, Holati,” he 
said. “I’ve notified the police and 
Fiam and Welk will be arrested 
very shortly.” 

The Commissioner said doubt- 
fully, “Well, our Maccadon po- 
lice — ” 

“The matter will require no bril- 
liance on their part, Holati. Fiam 
informed me he and Welk intended 
to be enjoying themselves innocent- 
ly at a social function within twenty 
minutes after leaving this labora- 
tory. That was approximately half 
an hour ago ...” Professor Man- 
telish nodded at the ComWeb. “I 
expect the police to call at any mo- 
ment, to advise me they have been 
picked up.” 

“Better not take a chance on 
that. Professor,” Trigger warned. 
“They might change their plans 
now they have the stuff, and decide 
to get off the planet immediately.” 

“It would make very little differ- 
ence, Trigger. If Paes Fiam had 
waited until the official report on 



the Tang planet was out he would 
have known better than to force me 
to inject him with the immortality 
drug. Aside from their savage ways 
the Tang are literally an unap- 
proachable people while under its 
influence; I and the various mem- 
bers of our expedition who experi- 
mented with it on ourselves had to 
wait several months for its effect to 
wear off again before we were able 
to feturn to civilization. We would 
not have been able to live among 
the Tang at all if we had not had 
our olfactory centers temporarily 
shutoff.” 

“Olfactory centers?” said 
Trigger. 

“Yes. It was absolutely neces- 
sary. Within half an hour after be- 
ing administered to an animal or- 
ganism, the Tang drug produces 
the most offensive and hideously 
penetrating stench I have ever en- 
countered. Wherever Paes Fiam 
and Welk may be on the planet, 
they have by now been prostrated 
by it and are unmistakably adver- 
tising their presence to anyone 
within half a mile of them. I have 
advised the police that space hel- 
mets will be needed by the men sent 
to arrest them, and — ” 

He broke off as the ComWeb 
began shrilling its summons, 
added, “Ah, there is the call I have 
been expecting! Perhaps you’ll take 
it, Trigger? Say I’m indisposed; 
I’m afraid the authorities may be 
feeling rather irritable with me at 
the moment.” •

W HEN he came this time it was 
not to reveal himself in a 
backwater community of the Pro- 
vince of Judaea during the rule of 
Herod the Great and Augustus 
Caesar. 

Nobody seemed to know from 




137 





whence he came. Suddenly, he was 
before the iron portals of the White 
House. He walked through the 
gates, which were closed and locked 
at the time. 

He was a slim young man, seem- 
ingly about thirty, with a fairly 
dark complexion, and soft dark 
eyes. His brown beard had a 
reddish tinge. He wore what looked 
like leather sandals and a Roman 
toga, or some such garment. No- 
body who saw him had actually ever 
seen a Roman toga, that is, outside 
Hollywood productions, and even 
the most competent of wardrobers 
had never quite figured out how the 
Romans had draped those togas. 

He walked through the iron gates 
and confronted the guards, sub- 
machine guns in hand. They were 
smallish submachine guns, so as 
not to be conspicuous, not to overly 
throw off VIP visitors, or even tour- 
ists — some of whom were not aware 
of the fact that it was necessary to 
so protect the President. 

Yes, there were the guards. 

The lieutenant was Angelo Mari- 
tino who had been raised in a strict 
Catholic family and still moderately 
kept up his duties. Lieutenant 
Maritino was not unaware of art. 
The home of his birth had been 
plastered with it — Italian style. 

In short, he knew a halo when he 
saw one. 

His face was slack. He opened 
his mouth and said . nothing. 

The newcomer smiled gently and 
also said nothing. But into the 



minds of all present came, with soft 
amusement, Take me to your 
leader. 

There was no question. There 
wasn’t the beginning of a question. 
They didn’t frisk him. They didn’t 
even come within a half dozen 
yards of him. Lieutenant Maritino, 
shortly followed by the balance of 
the gate guards, let his submachine 
gun slip from his hands to the 
ground. 

At the portals of the White 
House, Angelo Maritino flustered, 
almost as though apologetically, to 
the Secret Service officer there, “A 
distinguished visitor to see . .” 

The other gawked. 

And the visitor passed gently 
through. 

He knew the way. Obviously, he 
knew the way. He knew the way 
everywhere. 

And then a finger of doubt slid 
up the spine of Mike McCord, one 
of the gate guards who had followed 
to this point. If the newcomer knew 
the way, if he knew everything, why 
did he bother to materialize in front 
of the White House gates? Why 
didn’t he simply show up in the 
Oval Room? 

The visitor looked at him and 
smiled. He said, in English, his 
voice infinitely gentle, “I wished to 
observe the premises with my phy- 
sical senses. One whom I regarded 
as a friend used to reside here. He 
was shot one night while attending 
a theatre.” He added absently, 
“Happily, we were able to clone

him and now he dwells with us.” 
The news of his coming raced 
before them. Doors opened magi- 
cally and the newcomer, with his 
escort trailing wide-eyed behind, 
passed placidly through. 

Finally they reached the ultimate 
door and that, too, swung open. 
The President stood there behind 
his desk, flanked by his two chief 
aides. All stared, unblinkingly. 

The newcomer said gently to the 
guards, “That will be all,” and he 
entered the Oval Room. The door 
closed behind him. 

H e looked at the three and 
smiled sadly. Without being 
told, the aides suddenly knew they 
were not to remain. They hurried 
from the office through a side door. 
Scurried might be the better word. 

“You may call me Joshua,” the 
newcomer said to the President. “It 
is a name I have used in the past.” 
He settled himself in a comfortable 
blue leather-covered chair in front 
of the presidential desk and regard- 
ed his host. 

The President lowered himself 
weakly into his own chair. 

Joshua said, his expression dis- 
tantly amused now, “So, despite 
your public pronouncements, you 
do not believe in the Bible.” 

“I . I . .” 

“It is quite historic, in spite of 
the many alterations made in the 
original books by the various sects 
and cults that have translated it to 
their own ends through the ages.” 



“I . I was thinking of Genesis, 
rather than the later books written 
in the historic period.” 

“Yes. As I say, quite historic. 
When we inspired it, we found it 
amusing to stick as closely to reality 
as possible. Even the planetary en- 
gineering resulting in the creation 
of this world took approximately 
seven days, using your present 
system of time measure. And, as 
you can see, when w6 created man, 
we did so in our own image.” 
“Created man?” the President 
said weakly. “But I’ve read that it 
took man more than a million years 
to evolve from a less advanced pri- 
mate. We have evidence — skele- 
tons, artifacts . .” 

The other nodded acceptance. 
“Yes, largely you are correct, but 
we guided the way, intrigued by 
watching evolution take place. 
However, from time to time we 
intervened. Most recently, when 
what you call Neanderthal man 
seemed to have become a dead end, 
we helped introduce Cro-Magnon.” 
The President shook his head. 
“I ... I am afraid I am completely 
bewildered. What . what is 
planetary engineering?” 

“Just what it sounds to be. You 
see, there are more than a billion 
stars in this galaxy alone that have 
planets that are capable of sustain- 
ing life as we know it. Indeed, life 
as we know it, and other life forms 
as well, have developed indepen- 
dently on some of them. But what 
you call the panspermia theory was 



SECOND ADVENT 



139 




at work more often.” 

‘‘I don’t believe I have heard of 
that theory.” 

“On earth, a Swedish chemist, 
Svanta Arrhenius, first suggested 
in 1908 that living cells floated hap- 
hazardly through the universe, 
bringing life to suitable planets. 
But it was your American, Francis 
Crick, the scientist who discovered 
DNA and won the Nobel prize, who 
hit upon the reality. He, with Leslie 
Orgel, advanced the theory that life 
had come to this planet by space- 
ship, a deliberate act of seeding. 
Their clue was a valid one, I must 
say. That there is only one generic 
code for terrestial life. Previously, 
most of yoru biologists had thought 
life had sprung up spontaneously in 
some great ‘primeval soup’ but had 
that been so there would undoubt- 
edly have been a number of differ- 
ent generic codes.” 

If anything, the President’s stare 
was intensified. He blurted, “Do 
you mean to say that life here on 
Earth was deliberately put here by 
an extraterrestial ...” 

“Yes,” the other nodded serious- 
ly. “That is what I have just told 
you.” 

“And . you are one of them?” 
Joshua smiled. “Is it not ob- 
vious?” 

“But . well, the halo . .” 

It flicked out. “I assumed it to 
focus immediate attention upon 
myself, and also, if you will forgive 
me, for amusement. Our race has 
not lost its sense of humor.” 



The President slumped back into 
his chair, feeling a bit more in 
control of himself, but not quite 
entirely. 

He shook his head. “But if you 
are from a different star system, 
which one, and how far is it from 
Earth? This is simply mind 
boggling.” 

“From the star system Delta 
Pavonis, as you call it. It is approx- 
imately 19.2 light years from the 
Solar System.” 

The President had him now. 
“But for you to come here to Earth, 
you personally, and then return, 
would take almost forty years even 
if you could travel at the speed of 
light, which is impossible.” 

He who had named himself 
Joshua smil^ again. “Your Ein- 
stein pointed out that an object 
cannot travel at the speed of light. 
He said nothing about traveling at 
a speed greater than light. Yes, of 
course, your first reaction is to say, 
‘But how would it be possible to 
achieve speeds greater than that of 
light without passing the impossible 
hurdle?’ I am afraid you are insuf- 
ficiently acquainted with science to 
understand, but in physics there 
are many examples of jumping 
from one condition of energy, of 
velocity ,v or quantum state, to an- 
other without passing through the 
intermediate values. The tunnel 
diode is an example you even now 
utilize. In it the electrons tu /me/, as 
it were, from one side of an 
electrical barrier to the other with- 



140 



IF 




out going through it. Your race is 
not quite ready for faster than light 
travel, but soon, if my mission is 
successful, it will be.” 

The President said, “My mind is 
reeling. I simply can’t comprehend 
what you are saying. That you 
people seeded this planet and intro- 
duced life.” He hesitated for a 
moment before saying, “Why? 
What motivates you?” 

Joshua made a mouth of depre- 
cation. “Perhaps a missionary zeal 
to spread our life form throughout 
the galaxy. However, the brain is 
infinitely curious. I am afraid our 
primary motivation is the study of 
life. We have seeded, in our time, a 
considerable number of planets 
which will sustain existence as we 
know it. Usually a bit of planetary 
engineering is necessary, as it was 
here. I, personally, became increas- 
ingly intrigued with this world par- 
ticularly after the race entered the 
historic period.” 

A suspicion was beginning to 
come to the President. He said, 
“You have been here before, 
then?” 

“Oh, yes, various times, to watch 
the experiment develop. I seldom 
manifested myself in quite this 
manner. Sometimes the things I 
attempted to do came a cropper, to 
use your idiom. On one occasion, 
for instance, I wished to form a 
more advanced religion than per- 
tained at the time; a higher ethic. 
Evidently, I was premature. The re- 
ligion was a higher ethic than be- 



fore, well enough, but few,' if any, 
really followed it.” Joshua smiled in 
memory. “But it was an exciting 
and fascinating experiment.” 

The President said warily, “You 
mentioned a mission.” 

Joshua nodded. “Yes. You see, 
your race has reached a crossroads. 
In fact, it reached it some time ago 
but so far has failed to take the 
appropriate turning.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

“Very well. Follow me closely. 
You have heard of the late Dr. 
Robert Oppenheimer.” 

“Yes, certainly. Of the Man- 
hattan Project, the atomic bomb.” 
The other nodded. “In discussing 
the knowledge explosion, he said in 
1955 that human knowledge was 
doubling every eight years. Con- 
sider the ramifications. Let us 
suppose this knowledge explosion 
really got underway in 1940. By 
1948, human knowledge was 
double. And by the time Oppen- 
heimer made his statement it was 
four times as much. Do you realize 
how great it would be in just one 
century? By the year 2038 A.D. at 
this rate of explosion, human 
knowledge will be 8,192 times what 
it was in 1940. Can you compre- 
hend what it will be in the year 
2140? By that year, you will have 
more than 67 million times as much 
knowledge as you did in 1940. 
Happily (and inevitably) you have 
already achieved the computer and 
its data banks. Other break- 
throughs will continue to help in

what can only be called your plight. 

“This is beyond your conception 
now. Today you are beginning your 
explorations into space, you are be- 
ginning the conquest of the diseases 
that have plagued you down 
through the centuries. You are be- 
ginning, just beginning, scientific 
research, even into such fields as 
the nature of life and the achieving 
of immortality. You are not yet 
quite beginning, but are on the 
verge of taking the steps that will 
make this planet into a true gar- 
den, a paradise, if you will. But at 
this point you cannot conceive of 
the reality of 67 million times as 
much knowledge as you have today. 
You must understand that, as 
things are now, you do not have 67 
million times as much knowledge 
as does, say, a cockroach or an ant. 
Can you imagine, even faintly, your 
new race? At that time, you too, 
most likely, will be practicing pans- 
permia.” 

“Your mission,” the President 
said hoarsely. 

Joshua looked at him in compas- 
sion. He said, “You are at the 
crossroads. A race cannot develop 
scientifically and technologically 
without also developing ethically, 
without developing, at the same 
pace, a superior code of mores. 
There can be no such things as 
wars, the, military, race differences, 
poverty, conflict between the sexes 
and generations. I could go on.” 

The President was blank. 

Joshua said, still compassionate- 



ly, “Your codes today are such that 
the human race must destroy itself 
within your next decade if they are 
not revised.” 

The President slumped again. 

Joshua said gently, “In the past 
we have seldom interfered in human 
affairs. When we did, sometimes 
the results were unhappy. For in- 
stance, one of our people who has 
long observed Earth helped take 
the steps to remove the Czar of All 
the Russias, who was an incompe- 
tent, foolish, unintelligent man and 
his country in corrupt chaos. Less 
than ten years later, Stalin had 
taken his place.” 

“But . .” the President said. 

“Matters have come to such a 
head that we must intervene if we 
are to see our experiment con- 
tinue.” 

“I see,” the President said, his 
lips pale. “What steps?” 

A .45 caliber Colt automatic 
materialized on the desk before 
him. 

Joshua stood, infinite sadness on 
his face. “Men such as yourself are 
not competent to lead the human 
race, Mr. President.” 

The President was goggling the 
weapon. “I ... I refuse to sui- 
cide.” 

“You have no alternative, I am 
afraid. All of your people, outside,, 
will have forgotten I was ever here. 
They will never know what moti- 
vated you. And now I leave for 
Moscow . on a similar mission.” 

He disappeared. •

ADVERTISING CONSULTANT 
DATE: September 25 
While I am sure that this “adver- 
tising genius nobody ever sees” pos- 
ture is a necessary part of your 
image, I still do not care very much 
for your way of doing business. I 
like to meet a man face to face, and 
I must say I find this corresponding 
rather eccentric. Nevertheless, you 



have given us such brilliant advice 
on campaigns in the past that I am 
sure you are the only one who can 
handle this problem if it can be 
handled at all. To be brief; given 
unlimited funds, could you make a 
short, fat, ugly woman President of 
the United States?

TO: COLFAX 
DATE: September 26 

She has innumerable liabilities, 
not the least of which is that we 
can’t type her. She’s not homey 
enough for Golda Meir, nor flam- 
boyant enough for Bella Abzug — 
and the way she looks precludes 
just about anything else. Besides 
that she’s very shy, totally unphoto- 
genic and has a disconcerting habit 
of telling the truth. Six agencies 
turned her down before we got 
her — even when offered unlimited 
funds. Two of them literally laugh- 
ed in her face! 

Something of a recluse, but very 
personable in small groups. Ex- 
tremely intelligent, but wants to be 
President out of some strange sense 
of moral duty. Not a Women’s 
Libber or anything, just a sort of 
anachronism who thinks she’s best 
suited for the job and therefore 
duty-bound to take it. Very sophis- 
ticated outside of this sixteenth 
century notion of moral responsi- 
bility.

Agreed. She says she’ll do what- 
ever she has to do — unless it in- 
volves joining one of the political 
parties or is blatantly dishonest. 
She doesn’t seem to be politically 
naive, but she’s adamant on the 
point of not joining one of the 
parties — not that it matters much 
since neither of them would have 
her anyway. 

FROM: COLFAX 
TO: WEBER 
DATE: September 30 
Good. We’ll run the entire cam- 
paign through television. Nothing 
until next September 12; then, I 
want two minutes out of every half 
hour until Election Day. In the 
meantime, get me the following: 

1. About twenty Types — the kind 



144 



IF 




you use in the potato chip and 
shaving commercials — house- 
wives, football players, police- 
men, little old ladies, doctors, 
etc. None of them too good look- 
ing. Have the women a little on 
the plain side, something she 
can blend in with. 

2. One athletic, intelligent, articu- 
late Black male. 

3. One white male, about sixty. 
The Grand-Old-Man-type, 
white hair, moustache and 
goatee, robust. The kind you 
use in the Impeccable Taste ads, 
but more sagacious. 

4. One white female who can look 
like she has a Ph.D. in Political 
Science without losing anything 
as a sex symbol. 

5. One white male about thirty-five 
who looks as much as possible 
like the Virile- Young-Man with- 
out looking too much like a 
Kennedy. All of the Four must 
be physically and mentally 
superior. 

6. An estate outside New York, se- 
cluded, one where we can main- 
tain absolute security. NO ONE 
who works on this project can be 
attached in any way. We are go- 
ing to hide them away until after 
the election. NONE of the actors 
is ever to be seen in public 
unless I order it. 

I must have ABSOLUTE author- 
ity in this thing. No one is to know 
for certain who the Candidate is so 
your client will have to agree to act 



like everyone else. That means 
she’ll have to take orders just like 
any other actor; if word of her 
identity gets out prematurely or she 
wants to pull out part way through, 
you forfeit $200,000 a month for 
my time — from Sept. 25 to date of 
forfeiture. Agreed? 

Contact me again when you’ve 
secured everything on the list. We 
have over a year to go so be very se- 
lective. Take only those who are 
willing to cooperate completely and 
only the very best of those. PCS will 
handle the initial screening. We’ll 
need about three months for indoc- 
trination before filming begins. 

FROM: WEBER 
TO: COLFAX 
DATE: April 25 

Agreed. 

Files on the final selections will 
be sent to your office tomorrow. We 
have secured an estate in New Jer- 
sey about fifty miles outside the 
city. Two buses have been pur- 
chased and dummy buses have 
been rented to confuse anyone who 
might try to follow us.

Lam finished studying the files. 
The final selections are excellent. 
It’s surprising that Ms. Cavil has 
never entered a beauty contest — 
but very fortunate for us. Williams 
is very good for the Grand Old 
Man; very genteel. I don’t think

Saxon’s Boston accent will hurt us 
and I’m very pleased with Brown. I 
was afraid they would come up with 
a white man’s Black man, but this 
one is excellent. 

Begin filming the Gold-Edge 
Beer commercial and the Bright 
Detergent commercial Tuesday. 
We’ll need these shown as soon and 
as often as possible. They’ll give 
our real commercials something 
familiar to parallel. Begin the in- 
doctrination tomorrow. 



FROM: WEBER 
TO: COLFAX 
DATE: August 25 

I hope these things are being for- 
warded to you. This is a hell of a 
time to take a vacation. The actors 
are very enthused now that they 
know their mission. There is none 
of the jealousy you might expect 
with this many actors cooped up to- 
gether for so long. The screening 
must have been exceptionally good. 

I think most of them — certainly 
the Four — know who the Candidate 
is but it doesn’t matter; she’s made 
converts of all of them. They seem 
sincerely attached to her; her influ- 
ence on them is truly amazing. She 
has one of them studying Ecology; 
another Economics. One is becom- 
ing her expert on Education; an- 
other on Foreign Policy. It’s like 
she’s selected her cabinet already. 

I treated the whole thing like a 
game but she seems quite serious — 
and so do they. When do we start 



the first commercial? We’re about 
ready. 

FROM: COLFAX 
TO: WEBER 
DATE: September 1 

The idea for the first commercial 
is enclosed. Make it parallel the 
Gold Edge Beer commercial as 
closely as possible; shoot the same 
camera angles, etc. Most of this is 
the same action; read it anyway. 

Open with tight shot of huddle. 
Close-up of Ms. Cavil in her sweat- 
shirt, cap, whistle, etc., calling the 
play. Wide angle for snap from 
center. Cut to Saxon running his 
pattern; long pass to him on run; 
circus catch. (Shoot this one until 
you get something spectacular. The 
files indicate that both Saxon and 
Brown played football in college). 

Follow Saxon down sideline to 
where he gets hemmed in by the 
last defensive man. Brown comes 
from off-camera left to block the 
defensive man. (Again, something 
that crunches. This will be shown 
during a lot of professional football 
games, and we don’t want it to look 
pale by comparison.) Cut to Saxon 
as he scores. 

Close-up of Saxon and Brown 
congratulating each other. Cut to 
close-up ofGrand Old Man nodding 
approvingly from the sidelines. 
Close-up of button on his lapel 
reading: TEAMWORK COUNTS. 
(Distribute 5,000,000 of these 
buttons around the country the 
same week.)

Wide angle shot of crowd run-

Brown. Keep the Candidate in 
front, but a little out of focus. Cut

States has appeared in this com- 
mercial.’’

Very effective. A lot like the 
“Camels- Are-Coming!’’ campaign 
and the car commercials we did 
with the new models under a drape. 
We’re ready for number- two. By 
the way, our client has them all 
meeting an hour a day for what she 
calls consciousness raising. You 
don’t suppose she’s a Libbie after 
all? 

FROMj COLFAX 
TO: WEBER 
DATE: September 9 
I don’t really care what she is. 
My job is to get her elected. En- 
closed is the second script. Shoot 
the same opening as the Bright 
commercial except that instead of 
having Cavil explain how the deter- 
gent works have her talk about how 
detergents and industrial wastes 
are fouling our water supply. 

As she’s talking, four men come 
into the laundromat and attack her 
(have them wear ski masks so we 



don’t offend any ethnic groups). 
She fights, one of them tears open 
her blouse (tiniest flash of nipple). 
Saxon and Brown enter dressed as 
washer repairmen, come to her aid. 

Series of rapid cuts: knives, feet, 
faces, different camera angles, 
mostly low. Each disables one op- 
ponent; Cavil finishes hers with a 
Karate chop. Fourth assailant runs 
for the door where the Grand Old 
Man, entering, jabs him with his 
walking stick (have the old man 
take a good impact on the stick and 
grab his shoulder in pain.) 

Pan around laundromat: clothes 
all over the floor, an old woman hys- 
terical in the corner witlvthe Candi- 
date comforting her. Cavil trying to 
hold her blouse closed, Saxon and 
Brown both cut over the right eye, 
the old man rubbing his shoulder, 
the four toughs sprawled about on 
the floor. Dolly back out through 
the window to wide angle shot of 
laundromat. 

Superimpose and voice-over: 
“When a crime is committed, 
everyone suffers. We must fight 
crime in the streets and the condi- 
tions that cause it. Vote for THE 
CANDIDATE.’’ Both Right and 
Left will interpret that one to our 
advantage.

Of course it exploits women! 
How many commercials have they 
seen that don’t? Ask Cavil this: If 
she had to break into a prison to 
free her sisters would she refuse to 
do it because she’d have to dress up 
as a male guard? And tell your 
client that when she’s President she 
can appoint Kate Millett head of 
the FCC and change all the com-

must stay as is. Causes require sac- 
rifices.

She says to tell you you must 
mean “The end justifies the

precedence over ideology. They’ll 
do the script as written. 

You’ve opened a fine can of 
worms with that crack about the 
FCC. Now they’re drawing up a list 
of government agencies that can be 
controlled by appointment. And 
making a list of appointees!

Things have settled down a bit 
and the filming is going very well. 



The Karate stuff looks authentic. 
Brown is familiar with it and acted 
as technical director. I don’t think 
they’re really serious about that 
list. Williams told me they have 
Angela Davis down for Supreme 
Court Justice. He had such a 
straight face I almost thought he 
was serious. Anyway, it helps them 
pass the time between takes.

Procedures for voting must be 
identical to those used in the real 
election. It will cost us another 
million in persuasion money to get 
“THE CANDIDATE” printed on 
the real ballot and to have anything 
written in counted as a vote for us, 
but it will be well worth it. Also she 
will have to secretly change her

What are we going to do?! The 
•President has just accepted a chal- 
lenge to debate! What if they in- 
clude us?! 

FROM: COLFAX 
TO: WEBER 
DATE: October 15 

And admit we’re a legitimate 
alternative? Not likely. Here’s the 
next commercial; release it the day 
a/ifcr the debate. 

Wide angle shot of auditorium; 
pan slowly to platform where the 
President and the Democratic nom- 
inee are debating. They cannot be 
heard because the crowd is booing 
too loudly. Both men ignore the 
crowd entirely. The crowd grows 
violent and begins to throw things. 
Secret Service men draw their guns. 
Cut to series of other weapons in 
the audience. 

Brown jumps up on the left side 
of the stage, Cavil on the right. 
They gesture for order and the 
crowd quiets. Brown speaks. 

“Everyone has the right to say 
what he wants, even the people who 
barred us from this platform! Even 
the people who denied us the oppor- 
tunity to confront them on the real 
issues of the campaign. Even the 
people who have been trying to 
keep us from talking to you, the 
people, by putting pressure on tele- 
vision station owners to drop our 
commercials!’’ 



Cavil speaks. “These men have a 
right to speak! Even though every 
word they say is put into their 
mouths by the rich and powerful 
men who are paying for their cam- 
paigns. Even though they won’t tell 
you about the deals they’ve already 
made they have the right to speak! 
Everybody has that right! Not just 
those who agree with us! Every- 
body!” Saxon shouts, “Right!” 
Wild applause. 

Pan slowly past the Candidate to 
Williams, smiling his approval. 
Superimpose words and voice-over: 
“It’s not who you are but what you 
believe in that’s important. Vote 
for the candidate nobody owns. 
Vote for THE CANDIDATE.”

to the estate and watch it all on tele- 
vision as soon as you give these in- 
structions to the group. 

Everything is set. The group will 
come to the podium in a body as 
soon as we are mathematically as- 
sured of victory. The Four will be in 
the middle, the Candidate a little to 
the right. The house lights will go 
off and the assassination film will 
be shown. The TV people are al- 
ready prepared for a film of some 
sort as part of the speech so they’ll 
have no trouble carrying the whole 
thing. The film is pretty gruesome, 
even in black and white. 

When the house lights come on 
again, the whole group will repeat 
the following in unison: 

TIME AFTER TIME, THE WILL OF

VENTED BY AN ACT OF VIOLENCE.

IF 





R ecently, quite a bit of atten- 
tion on the part of academe 
has been devoted to attempting to 
define science fiction. Unfortunate- 
ly, most of that effort has been 
spent in trying to discover how it is 
like other forms of fiction. By now, 
it should be obvious that such work 
is totally non-productive. 

The real task is to discover how 
science fiction differs from other 
literature. Certainly there must be 
some difference; at a time when 
most fiction seems to be having less 
and less appeal in the market, 
science fiction is booming. It alone 
seems to have engendered a large 
and enthusiastic fandom. And 
somehow it is capable of holding 
the interest of informed and intelli- 
gent readers even when its execu- 
tion is crude and its plotting ob- 
vious. It would surely seem that its 
attraction lies not in its similarity to 



other fiction*, but in its dissimilarity. 

Well, just how does science 
fiction differ from “mainstream”? 
Not in its interest in the future, ap- 
parently; despite the fact that most 
science fiction is laid in some 
future, many of the most admired 
works are laid in a present (not 
necessarily this one) or a past 
(again, not necessarily the stan- 
dard-model). Piper’s Paratime 
stories, for instance, take place 
largely in an alternate-world pres- 
ent or in milleaus vaguely like 
various periods of our history. It 
isn’t any preoccupation with science 
either. The science in many of our 
classics is minimal, if not outright 
fantasy; we accept time-travel, al- 
ternate worlds, faster- than-light 
travel and psionics as quickly as the 
hard laws of physics. 

It seems to me that the funda- 
mental difference is that we accept 



153 




change as the basis of our fiction. 

Other fiction is based upon our 
perception of the world as it is and 
as we believe it to have been. Most 
literature exists in the now of the 
writer, and the object is to present 
that eternal now as if it were the 
absolute guide to excellence. A 
writer of the “mainstream” is 
usually judged by the reality shown 
in his work. Fiction holds up a 
mirror to reality, according to one 
dictum. (Of course, whoever pro- 
mulgated that had no conception of 
the specialized laws of fiction, 
which do not conform to the lack of 
order and justice in reality.) 

Even our historical fiction — 
which must include the Western 
category — is pretty, much a fiction 
of that eternal now. With rare ex- 
ceptions, it follows our current pre- 
conceptions of mankind, with only 
a token gesture toward history. 
Thus, our current concept of ro- 
mantic love — only a few hundred 
years old — is grafted onto the so- 
called age of chivalry, when the 
concepts of the people were not at 
all similar. 

Science fiction in some measure 
rejects that unchanging present 
order of things. It states in essence 
that the world of the story is dif- 
ferent from the present (or the ac- 
cepted past) of the reader. The dif- 
ference may be in science, environ- 
ment, attitude, or the basic nature 
of humanity. But it should be a real 
change in the accepted concepts of 
reality. 



The readers are those who can 
step out of their present frame and 
accept other frames of reference. 
Naturally, that requires more flexi- 
bility than many readers can show, 
so we have a rather small and spe- 
cialized readership. The writers are 
also forced beyond the normal at- 
titudes of authorship; inevitably, 
since such a special skill is required 
of them, they sometimes show less 
of other skills such as characteri- 
zation. And the effect of our litera- 
ture on those used to dealing only 
with an unchanging reality must be 
confusing, which is why attempts to 
relate science fiction to the other 
branches of literature are so unpro- 
ductive. 

Incidentally, the idea of an es- 
sential change in the nature of 
reality does not rule out fantasy. 
Most of the older fantasy, of 
course, dealt with an accepted idea 
of the past — myths of ghosts, were- 
wolves, etc. But a literature of 
change has grown up in fantasy, 
also. Tolkien’s work is an example, 
demanding a whole change in 
world-line, with its own history, 
races, and methodology. Such fan- 
tasy seems to be generally accepted 
by science fiction readers, however, 
unlike the older forms based on 
superstition. 

This isn’t definition by function, 
but it does relate to it. It’s defini- 
tion by expectation on the part of 
the reader; he expects to find a 
science fiction story dealing with at 
least some essential change in the 



154 



IF 




reality he knows. 

Most of the academic attempts to 
define science fiction that I have 
seen have been definition by label; 
they simply find some word or 
phrase that somehow relates to 
general literature, and then attempt 
to show that the label fits. This 
is somewhat like defining sulphur 
and gold as yellow elements; it may 
even be true, but the only use such 
label-finding has is in advancing 
the label-maker’s status. 



A CASE in point is New Worlds 
, for Old, by David Ketterer 
(Anchor, $2.95). The label here is 
“apocalyptic”. It isn’t too bad a 
label, in the sense it is used; much 
of science fiction can be squeezed 
into the box bearing that label. But 
so can a good deal of other fiction 
(and non-fiction). I quarrel with 
the spirit of the word, however; 
usually, apocolyptic literature has a 
serious intent of revelation — where- 
as generally science fiction doesn’t 
take its changes very seriously, but 
instead uses them to entertain. 
Also, of course, there is a residue of 
revelation implicit to the term — a 
residue which persists, even though 
Ketterer makes it plain he does not 
mean it — where science fiction 
merely presents, not expecting the 
reader to believe any of it beyond 
the period of reading the story. 

New Worlds for Old presents 
critical essays on a hodge-podge of 
works: Utopias, stories of Poe and 



Twain, Melville, Vonnegut, and 
Ursula LeGuin. Certainly there 
isn’t even the beginning of broad 
enough an examination of science 
fiction as a whole to justify any 
generalizations. As usual in such 
works, the idea seems to be to grab 
up anything (particularly “accept- 
able” examples) that will reinforce 
the essential idea, rather than test- 
ing the supposition for exceptions. 

Also, so far as I can determine, 
there is little to be gained from the 
critical essays themselves. In exam- 
ining LeGuin’s Left Hand of Dark- 
ness, for instance, Ketterer seems 
totally unaware of one of the basic 
attractions of the novel. He never 
goes into the love between Genly Ai 
and Estravan,' though that is the 
underlying — and extremely signifi- 
cant — theme of much of the book. 
This is also an example of love so 
radically changed that it is unique; 
a love between humans that is not 
between man and man or woman 
and woman — nor can it be consid- 
ered heterosexual. It is love between 
human and human, beyond all nor- 
mal encounters. Certainly some 
study of that must be made in any 
critical analysis of the novel, and its 
absence makes the entire critical 
approach of the book suspect. 

If I sound bitter and hostile to 
the idea of academic criticism it is 
only because of the examples I have 
seen in our field. A good critic with 
an extensive background in general 
literature can deepen both the 
understanding and delight of any 



READING ROOM 



155 




literature, provided he approaches 
it with his own familiarity of the 
field and appreciation of it. C. S. 
Lewis made my reading of the 
medieval romances come back to 
my mind anew, and with deeper 
insights and greater joy. He might 
well have given us superb criticism 
of science fiction — since he liked 
the field — but unfortunately we 
have only small bits and casual in- 
terviews. A great pity. But even in 
the absence of such a critic, we can 
safely do without such books as 
that by Ketterer. 

A BOOK I have neglected, unfortu- 
nately, for far too long is 
Philip Wylie’s The End of the 
Dream (DAW, 95c). This is an in- 
teresting example of something 
seen too rarely — a book which 
shows how the changes come about 
in more detail than it shows the 
changes themselves. It’s a bitter 
book — as it had to be, since Wylie’s 
essential love of the best in 
humanity always had to be opposed 
to what he saw happening. It’s a 
novel dealing with the decay of our 
civilization and the desperation of 
those who attempt to halt that ruin. 

Wylie shows this with the mini- 
mum of coincidences. He doesn^t 
take the easy way out by having a 
great atomic holocaust, a sudden 
plague released by warring powers, 
or an alien invasion. He simply 
takes things which are already 
present in our culture and shows 
step-by-step how they lead to dis- 



aster — a disaster that could be 
averted. And because he was a man 
who saw with extraordinary clarity 
and deep feeling (and saw much of 
this at least twenty years before 
anyone else seemed aware of it), his 
story has great intensity. 

It isn’t great fiction; the plotting 
is sometimes minimal and the 
ending not clearly stated. But the 
events have a drama of their own 
that makes most of the so-called 
speculative fiction with its irrele- 
vant “relevance” seem pretty tame. 
The disaster here is real, not a mere 
prop for words and mood. If you 
can still find a copy, get it.

F rederik pohl, who once edited 
this magazine, is now selecting 
science fiction for Bantam Books. 
The first “Frederik Pohl Selection” 
is now available. It’s Commune 
2000 A.D., by Mack Reynolds 
(95c). Reynolds has altered the 
basic reality of the world in one 
way, mostly; the economic struc- 
ture. His world has a Universal 
Guaranteed Income which everyone 
gets automatically credited to him, 
and which is enough to make work 
unnecessary. Those who want to 
work and who can prove their 
ability are granted larger incomes. 
Those who want to pursue hobbies 
or simply loaf are free to do so. 

This is the same world Reynolds 
has used in a number of his stories, 
and it’s a convincing one. The novel 
apparently fits into his series some- 



156 



IF 




where in the middle. It deals with a 
man who sets out — at the govern- 
ment’s bequest — to investigate the 
strange communes of like-minded 
people that are springing up; there 
are communes for nature-freaks, 
artists, and most every other group. 
During the investigation, Swain de- 
cides that those who sent him need 
a little investigating themselves, 
and from there on the plot deepens. 
It may be the perfect world eco- 
nomically, but (surprise!) the basic 
nature of the people running it 
hasn’t changed. 

It isn’t a particularly strong or 
fresh novel to any who have read 
Reynolds’ other works in this back- 
ground. But it does throw consider- 
able insight into the nature of the 
traveling cities and the attitudes of 
the people who travel in them. And 
it makes for generally good read- 
ing. Moderately recommended. 

O NE chapter of The Godwhale, 
by T. J. Bass (Ballantine, 
$1.25), appeared in Galaxy maga- 
zine, but most of the novel will be 
new to Galaxy /If re&ders. In it, the 
godwhale (Rorqual Maru) appears 
as only a part in this study of a 
world that has been completely 
changed. The men who built the 
whale-like cyborg have spent their 
energies in going out to the stars. 
Behind them, over a long span of 
years. Earth’s major society has 
been forced by gross overpopula- 
tion to resort to a hive type of so- 
ciety, where the individual becomes 



lost in the complex of survival. 
Meantime, in the sea, men have 
developed a small — but extremely 
complex — outcast society where 
freedom still exists. 

This story tells of the struggle 
between the two societies and of 
separate struggles within them. 
The godwhale enters into all these 
struggles, playing a major part in 
the events. This is a novel of great 
inventiveness, and many of the 
creatures — human, as well as non- 
human — are fascinatingly drawn. 
Some of the early chapters seem a 
bit cold, but this eventually resolves 
into a story where the emotional 
conflict is about as far from cold as 
possible. 

The star seekers aren’t forgotten, 
either. Throughout, there are in- 
creasing signs of their influence on 
the world that was left behind. And 
there’s a clever mathematical for- 
mula to define what makes a habit- 
able planet around any star. It fits 
very well and works out mathemati- 
cally. But I’m afraid it depends 
somewhat on the units of measure- 
ment used, and I don’t recommend 
taking it too seriously. Still, it 
makes for a nicely satisfactory end- 
ing. 

This is a complex and fascinating 
novel, and one I recommend as a 
fine example of what science fiction 
is all about. 

ANOTHER is Wfllk to the End of 
the World, by Suzy McKee 
Charnas (Ballantine, $1.25). This 



READING ROOM 



157 




novel has already received consider- 
able attention from those who have 
seen advance copies, and the re- 
sults are rather strange and confus- 
ing. Women readers seem to go 
“ape” over it, to varying degrees; I 
can’t really see why, but they 
consider it their story. 

Charnas has postulated a world- 
after-catastrophe, but not the typi- 
cal one. A small band of survivors 
have been forced to make do in a 
world where most animals and food 
plants have died. 

They have also evolved a culture 
which has elements of some of the 
Attic-Greek ideas, but essentially is 
unique to itself. In it the women are 
despised creatures, good only for 
simple work and breeding; the men 
have developed purely “masculine” 
mystiques, and strange relation- 
ships among themselves in which 
ideological homesexuality — similar 
to that in Athens — plays a part, but 
only a part. Naturally, since women 
are only animals to be used in 
common, men don’t normally know 
who sired them. 

The plot evolves out of the fact 
that one man does know who is his 
father. He bitterly resents the claim 
on him from this long-since lost 
father, and sets out to find him. 
What and where he finds him is a 
beautifully unexpected develop- 
ment. So is what we learn of the 
real place and culture of the 
women. 

It is not a “woman’s book”, so 
far as I can determine. Charnas is a 



new writer, but she’s in excellent 
control of her story; she tells it 
mostly through the eyes of her male 
characters, and does so convincing- 
ly. There is no obvious anti-male or 
pro-female prejudice I can find in 
her telling, and absolutely none of 
the “female” writing style some- 
times found in bad books. (Good 
writers are good writers, whether 
male or female, and Charnas is 
simply a good writer.) 

I recommend the book to readers 
of either sex — but if some woman 
reader can tell me why she regards 
this as special to her sex. I’d be 
glad to hear the answer. 

and in discussing new offerings 
from Ballantine Books I’d like 
to mention that they are beginning 
a series of “Best of’ books with one 
that’s rather special. This is The 
Best of Stanley G. Weinbaum 
($1.65), with a foreword by Isaac 
Asimov and an afterword by Robert 
Bloch, who knew Weinbaum. The 
eleven stories in the book really are 
the best of his work. And so far as I 
know, this is the first time “Valley 
of Dreams” has followed “Martian 
Odyssey” in any soft-cover publica- 
tion; the two really make one story, 
with the real importance of the 
story coming from the infrequently- 
reprinted sequel. 

Weinbaum, more than any other 
writer, helped to take our field out 
of the doldrums of the early thirties 
and into the beginnings of modem 
science fiction. Some of his plots 



158 



IF 




are a bit obvious now, and his 
human characterizations a bit 
skimpy. But he introduced the idea 
that aliens weren’t just bug-eyed 
monsters or slightly-altered hu- 
mans. He showed that other forms 
of life must have changes in atti- 
tude and social structure, and he 
made his aliens unforgettable. His 
works are still a joy to read.

part, The Day of Their Return 
(Science Fiction Book Club, $1.49) 
is an interesting addition. (There is 
a soft-cover edition from New 
American Library, but I haven’t yet 
seen it and don’t know the price.) It 
isn’t the best Anderson, but it’s still 
very good. 

This is a novel of cultures that 
have become wildly divergent on 
the world of Aeneas, and of a time 
when they must somehow learn to 
work together or be torn asunder by 
both inside and outside influences. 
Ivar, the hero, conspires against 
the Terran government of Aeneas, 
and is forced to flee his home cul- 
ture. He then drifts — or is forced — 
through the other cultures, even- 
tually with a bird-man from Ythri 
as a companion. The cultures are 
well drawn (though a bit too deri- 
vative from familiar ones), and 
there are some rather strange ele- 
ments that seem to be superim- 
posed over them. In the back-

ground is the Administrator from 
the Terran government; he’s a fas- 
cinating example of Anderson’s in- 
dividuals, who know their busi- 
ness — ^whether they seem to or not. 
And there’s a seeming prophet who 
believes he’s the resurrection of an 
ancient Being with godlike powers. 
(As it turns out, this Being domi- 
nates the novel rather far beyond 
his actual place in the story, I’m 
afraid.) 

It’s a good adventure' story, with 
something added, and well worth 
the attractive price. Anderson is a 
writer who discovered the real 
values of science fiction long ago 
and never fails to give us new in- 
sights into the changes possible in 
our literature. •

NOSTRADAMUS 

There once was a planet 
called Terra . 

CLARK COLLINS 




B anning said, “Sit down. This 
was just forwarded from Wash- 
ington. God knows how they got it. 
The poem, down at the bottom of 
the page.” 

His favorite field man took the 
proffered newspaper before sinking 
onto the leather couch. “This lim- 
erick?” he asked. 

Banning didn’t bother to answer 
him. It was the only verse on the 
page to which the paper had been 
folded. 

Rick Flavelle looked up again. 
“Pretty damn poor if you ask me,” 
he said. 

Banning heaved his bulk around 
so he could fish a cigarette from a 
pack on his desk, reached for his 
desk lighter. “You’re slipping, 
Richard,” he said. “Read it again.” 
Rick shrugged and read aloud 



this time. 

“The politico all called Fred 
“Was found irrevocably dead. 
“It seems in the night 
“An agile red sprite 
“Put an extra hole in his head.” 
He looked up again, frowning 
this time. Maybe it was too early in 
the morning for him to be sharp. 
He didn’t get it. He said, “I’m not 
particularly fond of limericks at 
best, but this seems worse than 
usual. I can’t imagine an editor. .” 
His superior said, “Look at the 
date.” 

Rick Flavelle hissed between his 
teeth. “Zowie,” he said. “The day 
before Donaldson was assassinated. 
Some coincidence, eh?” He won- 
dered why it should be of interest to 
David Banning, or of the Depart- 
ment’s central headquarters. 



160 




Banning said, “The name of the 
writer.” 

“Cassandra,” Rick said. “A nom 
de plume, eh? Wasn’t Cassandra a 
Greek? Somebody in mythology?” 

There was a heavy volume on the 
section head’s desk, open. Banning 
pulled it before him and read, evi- 
dently skipping bits as he went. 
“Cassandra, a Trojan princess, the 
daughter of King Priam and Queen 
Hecuba . , One of the Gods gave 
her the power of prophecy, but to 
offset it, another ruled that she 
would never be believed . Warn- 
ed the Trojans about the wooden 
horse the Greeks had left behind 
them, but they ignored her . 
When Troy fell she was made a 
slave by . well, that doesn’t 
matter.” 

Banning lifted a beefy hand and 
began ticking off on his fingers. 
“Secretary Donaldson’s first name 
was Fredric, everybody called him 
Fred. He was most certainly a poli- 
tician. He was found dead by his 
wife and one of the maids. He had 
been shot in the head during the 
night. Investigation proved that the 
assassin hadn’t entered by any 
door. He had somehow climbed to 
the third floor of the Donaldson 
home and entered through a win- 
dow. Which would make him agile. 
But that isn’t all.” 

UicK was looking at him, ex- 
Jt^pressionlessly. 

Banning shifted his bulk in his^ 
chair. “It hasn’t been released to 



the press that Mike Corbin was a 
pinko. The mucky-mucks aren’t 
interested in touching off another 
McCarthy era.” 

Rick’s eyebrows went up. “A 
party member?” 

“No. He belonged to some 
splinter group. An offshoot of the 
Trotskyites, or some such. But, by 
definition, he was a red. So that 
checks too.” 

His fieldman looked down at the 
limerick again, and hissed softly. 
“Some coincidence. Printed the 
day before it took place.” 

The other said wearily, “Check it 
out, Richard. The way things 
stand, Washington still isn’t sure 
that Mike Corbin was working 
alone. It’s a crying shame they 
didn’t capture him alive. Anyway, 
Washington wants us to check it 
out.” 

j^-j^OETRY editor?” the thin man 
with the rolled up sleeves 
and loosened tie said. “Does this 
weekly rag look big enough to have 
a poetry editor? I’m the editor, 
period. What can I do for you?” 
Rick Flavelle showed him his 
buzzer. 

“Security, huh?” the other said, 
showing that new interest they 
always showed. “What brings you 
to Waterport?” 

Rick brought the newspaper 
from his pocket. He indicated the 
limerick. “Who wrote this?” 

The editor glanced at it, without 
reading. “How would I know?” 



NOSTRADAMUS 



161 




The security agent looked at 
him. 

The editor grunted. “It’s a filler. 
When you’re making up the forms, 
you wind up with holes at the end of 
columns. You fill them with jokes, 
short news items that are timeless, 
children’s bright sayings, verse, 
that sort of thing.’’ 

Rick Flavelle said, “Well, where 
do you get these fillers?’’ 

“You can buy them wholesale 
through the agencies. Some items 
come in with publicity. The verse is 
usually submitted by local would-be 
poets. Gives them a bang to get 
published.” He looked at the 
limerick again. “Cassandra,’’ he 
said. “Seems to me I’ve seen that 
name before. Sends in stuff from 
time to time. If it’s not too bad, or 
too long, I have the linotypists set it 
up and it kicks around in the filler 
galleys until we need it.’’ 

“Do you know where I can get 
hold of this Cassandra?’’ 

The editor shook his head. 
“What do you want with her?’’ 
“How do you know it’s a her?’’ 
Rick said. 

“I don’t. Most poetry is sent in 
by women. Most of it stinks. Some- 
times they get sore because you 
don’t print their stuff and cancel 
their subscriptions. It’s one of the 
hazards running a small town 
paper. It was bad enough before, 
but about six months ago some 
British poet came through on a 
lecture tour, and after he left the 
local women formed a poetry club. 



Now I get a few reams a week.’’ 

“A poetry club,” Rick said. 
“You wouldn’t know the president 
or secretary, would you?’’ 

“I ought to,’’ the other said. 
‘‘She’s my mother-in-law. You 
ought to see her stuff.’’ 

R ick flavelle flicked his charm 
switch. ‘‘Mrs. Turner?” he 
beamed. ‘‘Your son-in-law, Mr. 
Semple, over on the Star, has 
referred me to you as the local 
- authority on poetry.” 

She beamed back, as condition- 
ed. “Ernest is a dear boy, it’s a 
shame those publishers won’t let 
him print more of my modest ef- 
forts, Mr. .” 

“Flavelle,” Rick said. “Richard 
Flavelle. What I wanted to ask you 
about, Mrs. Turner, was the iden- 
tity of the person who writes the 
Cassandra poems for the Star. I 
thought perhaps ...” He let the 
sentence fall away. 

“Poems!” she snorted. “A poem, 
young man, is an artistic composi- 
tion in verse. It has meter, it has 
rhythm, sometimes, though not al- 
ways, it has rhyme. I can assure 
you, the so-called poems written by 
Jerry Frankie have none of these 
characteristics save rhyme. I will 
admit that ...” 

“Jerry Frankie?” Rick said. 

She bit it off. “Over there,” she 
pointed. “He lives over there.” The 
door closed decisively. 

Over there was a rather vague 
direction. 



162 



IF 




Rick Flavelle crossed the street, 
went up a few doors and saw a man 
raking leaves on a front lawn. 

Rick said, “I wonder if you could 
direct me to the home of Jerry 
Frankie?” 

It was around the comer and 
down a few houses. Rick Flavelle 
went around the comer and down 
the declared number of houses. 
Under the bell was a small name 
plate. Jerome Frankie. He rang, 
without response. 

At the house next door the 
woman told him that Mr. Frankie 
returned from work at fifteen 
minutes past five. He was a clerk in 
\he department store downtown. 

It was almost five. Rick Flavelle 
went back to where he had left his 
car and drove it around and parked 
across the street from Frankie’s 
house. The neighborhood was of 
yesteryear. The owners of these 
rather old fashioned wooden resi- 
dences probably belonged in the 
five thousand a year bracket. No 
house was less than forty years old. 
It wasn’t the atmosphere of poli- 
tical assassination. But what is the 
atmosphere of the breeding ground 
of assassins? From whence come 
the nihilists? 

The car that pulled up before the 
home of Jerome Frankie was five or 
six years old, but had been kept up 
beyond the usual. In fact, the finish 
was beginning to show signs of 
wear, brought on by over-much 
washing and polishing. 

The driver got out and carefully 



locked his vehicle, then turned and 
mounted the steps. He looked to be 
about fifty. A dithering old maid if 
Rick Flavelle had ever spotted one. 

Rick exhaled, picked up the copy 
of the Waterport Star from the seat 
beside him and left his own car. He 
followed the other, coming up from 
behind him even while Frankie was 
still unlocking the front door. 

Rick said, ‘‘Hello, Mr. Frankie, 
I . .” 

The other looked over his shoul- 
der with a start. ‘‘Oh dear, you 
scared me. I don’t want to buy any- 
thing.” 

“Fine,” Rick said. ‘‘I don’t want 
to sell anything.” 

The other opened the door and 
stood in it, as though defiantly. 
‘‘And I pay my bills at the end of 
the month. There is no need to dun 
me.” 

Rick indicated the paper. ‘‘I 
wanted to talk to you about your 
Cassandra, uh, poems.” 

‘‘You do? Well . .” Jerome 
Frankie opened the door wider. 
‘‘Please come in. Lordy, I’m afraid 
the house is a mess. A frightful 
mess.' Middle-aged bachelor, you 
know.” 

The house was far from a fright- 
ful mess. Rather it was as though 
unoccupied, so spotlessly did the 
aging department-store clerk polish 
it. 

‘‘Could I offer you a nip of 
sherry? I’m afraid it’s only do- 
mestic, you know.” 

Rick thanked him, no. He came 



NOSTRADAMUS 



163 




to the point. “Mr. Frankie, how 
long had you known Michael 
Corbin?” 

The other twitched. “Who? I 
thought you said ...” 

“Mike Corbin.” 

“I’ve never had the pleasure . 
Mike Corbin. Why, I heard about 
him on the television. He was the 
man who . See here, just who 
are you?” 

Rick brought forth the buzzer 
again, and his I.D. Card. He 
passed them to the other for 
examination. 

“Good heavens,” Frankie said. 
“Security. How exciting.” 

“Sure,” Rick said. “I’ve been 
sent over from the Cincinnati 
office. Now about Mike Corbin.” 

“But I have never even seen the 
man. Never heard of him until . 
until the Secretary of State was so 
foully slain.” 

There had been nothing in the 
files on Corbin to indicate the 
assassin had ever been in Ohio. 
Rick said, “How long's it been 
since you were last in Washington, 
Mr. Frankie?” 

“Why, Lordy, I’ve never been 
out of Ohio in my life.” 

Wild goose chase. Coincidence. 

Rick indicated the poem. “What 
were the circumstances under which 
you wrote this?” 

Frankie twitched as he took the 
paper. He recognized the limerick 
immediately, obviously. He giggled. 
“Oh yes, that. It’s not really one of 
my better ones, you know. Some- 



times I do really good ones.” He 
giggled, archly. “The very best 
limericks are really quite unpub- 
lishable, don’t you think?” 

“Yes,” Rick said. “Look, where 
did you get this idea about Secre- 
tary Donaldson getting shot?” 
Frankie didn’t get it. 

Rick Flavelle looked at him for a 
long moment. Finally he said, 
“Listen: 

“The politico all called Fred 
“Was found irrevocably dead. 
“It seems in the night 
“An agile red sprite 
“Put an extra hole in his head.” 
Frankie said apologetically, 
“There are too many feet in the last 
line. I’ll admit.” 

Rick said, “How did you know 
Corbin was a red?” 

Frankie gaped at him. 

Inwardly, Rick Flavelle counted 
down. However, he couldn’t think 
of anything else to ask the other. 
On the facS of it, Jerome Frankie 
didn’t even know what the security 
operative was talking about. Rick 
Flavelle had drawn just about as 
blank a blank as he could have 
drawn. 

It had been a long drive up here. 
More for something to say, than 
anything else, Rick said, “Do you 
write many limericks with, uh, 
political and international connota- 
tions?” 

Jerry Frankie giggled. “Oh, I 
just started that line. I think you 
can be fiendishly clever in 
limericks. Mine are all nasty. I sign

IF 




them Cassandra. Do you know who 
Cassandra was?” 

“Yes,” Rick said. “Listen, do 
you have any more of them 
around?” 

“Why, I don’t think so. I never 
keep copies. I send them in to the 
Star or sometimes to the Enquirer 
in Cincinnati. Sometimes they’re 
printed and sometimes not. I’ve 
never made the Enquirer. I think 
this is the first of the limericks the 
Star'^ run but I’ve had several of 
my sonnets published. Would you 
like to see them?” 

Rick Flavelle said, “I suppose 
so.” 

Frankie left to return shortly 
with two newspaper clippings. Both 
were poems of fourteen lines, and 
rhymed, though with effort. One 
was entitled Flowers and the other 
Dau»/i.‘ Neither made much sense. 

Frankie said, apologetically 
again. “This is all I could find. I 
usually send a copy to my mother. 
She lives in Columbus with my 
sister.” 

Rick Flavelle came to his feet. 
“No more limericks, eh?” 

“I’m afraid not. Except, of 
course, for those I’ve sent to the 
which they haven’t printed yet. 
If they ever print them.” 

“Well, good day, Mr. Frankie,” 
Rick said. “Thanks for the cooper- 
ation.” 

Frankie followed him to the 
door, worriedly. “But what was it 
you wanted?” he all but wailed. 

“Nevermind. Nothing.’’ Rick 



told him. “It was a mistake.” 

O N THE way back to the high- 
way, he passed within half a 
block of the building which housed 
the Star. He looked at his watch. 
He had plenty of time to get back to 
Cincinnati. On an impulse, he 
headed for the newspaper office. 
Dammit, his reputation had it that 
he was old man Banning’s most 
thorough field man. He didn’t par- 
ticularly want the title, but he had 
it. 

The pretzel thin editor was in the 
process of rolling down his sleeves, 
obviously calling it a day, when 
Rick turned up again. 

“How’d you make out?’’ he 
asked. 

“Cassandra is an old maid, but 
male,” Rick told him. “Name of 
Jerome Frankie.” 

“Hell, I know him,” the other 
said. He fished his spare pencils 
from his shirt pocket and tossed 
them to the desk. “Jerry Frankie. I 
didn’t know he was the one who 
sent in the Cassandra fillers. I 
remember his mother. Psychic 
crackpot type. Used to try to get 
publicity for these seance deals.” 
Rick said, “According to him 
he’s sent in a few more limericks 
which you haven’t published yet.” 
“I probably filed them away in 
the wastepaper basket. Jokes make 
better fillers. Poems are usually too 
long.” 

Rick Flavelle didn’t know why, 
but he said, “If you didn’t throw 



NOSTRADAMUS 



165 




them away, where would they be?” 
The other scowled at him, for ob- 
vious reason. ‘‘I would have sent 
them down to be set up. They’d be 
in a filler galley.” 

“Could we take a look?” 

The other closed his eyes in exag- 
gerated disgust. “Jesus, is this what 
you hush-hush men spend your 
time doing? Come on. Never say 
Ernie Semple failed to cooperate 
with the witch hunters.” 

Rick Flavelle didn’t like the term 
and never had, in fact it churned 
him, but he remained patient. 

Ernie Semple led him down to 
the press room and over to some 
forms on a composing table. He 
pulled some metal trays from their 
racks. They were filled with clean 
slugs of type. 

“Can you read upside down and 
backward?” he said to Rick. 

Rick looked at him. 

“No. Can you?” 

“Yes,” the other said. “How- 
ever, I’ll pull a proof for you. Here, 
take this.” He handed Rick one of 
the galleys to carry and led the way 
to where there was ink, a roller, 
and scrap sheets of newsprint. 

He put the galley he was carrying 
down, inked the type, and pulled a 
proof. He handed it to Rick. “Start 
looking down that for verses signed 
Cassandra. I don’t think you’ll find 
any. By the way, I figured out why 
you wanted to see Jerry Frankie.” 
Rick was scanning the galley 
proof which consisted largely of un- 
believably poor jokes. He looked up 



momentarily, then returned to the 
list. “Oh, you did?” 

“Yep,” the editor told him, ink- 
ing the second tray of fillers. 
“Quite a coincidence, wasn’t it? 
Jerry’s limerick hit it right on the 
head.” 

At the bottom of the ink-wet 
galley proof, Rick Flavelle spotted 
a limerick. It was signed, Cas- 
sandra. 

Number One in the Kremlin 
bragged 

His economy no longer lagged. 
But the folk who were hungry 
Got guns, bombs and sundry. 

And he should have zigged when 
he zagged. 

It didn’t make much sense. In 
fact, it wasn’t even as good as the 
first — that last line didn’t fit in with 
the others at all. 

Semple said, “Find one?” 

Rick said, “Yes. You mean to 
tell me you can’t find better stuff 
than this to print?” 

The editor sighed. “I told you 
most of it stank. But local poets 
'you’ll always have with you. And 
you have to run a certain amount of 
their stuff to keep them, and their 
relatives, and their neighbors, and 
their shopmates, happy. Let’s see 
it.” 

On an impulse, Rick shook his 
head. He folded the galley proof 
and stuck it into his pocket. 

Ernie Semple’s eyes inadvertently 
flickered down to the type in the 
galley, then quickly came back. 

Rick shook his head and brought 



166 



IF 




the galley proof back from his 
pocket. He reached down and 
picked the lines of type from the 
metal tray, wrapped them in the 
newsprint, and returned the whole 
to his jacket pocket. 

Semple said, “Hey.” 

Rick said, “Thanks for the co- 
operation, Mr. Semple. The de- 
partment appreciates it.” He turn- 
ed to go, the other looking after 
him in disgust. 

I T WAS fairly late, but the office 
was blazing with light. Ob- 
viously, the chief was still on deck. 
Rick Flavelle gave a quick knock 
with a single knuckle before push- 
ing through the door. 

Banning looked up and said, 
“Don’t you ever knock? Better still, 
why dbn’t you get an okay from 
Janie before barging in?” 

His favorite field man said, “I 
just got back from Waterport. Saw 
the editor of the Star, finally lo- 
cated our poet. A jittering old jerk 
who writes rhymes so he can see his 
name in the paper. A complete 
blank.” 

Banning grunted and fished a 
cigarette from the pack on the desk 
with a beefy paw. “That’s what I 
thought you’d run into. Still . .” 
He shifted his bulk, in way of a 
shrug. 

Rick Flavelle brought the galley 
proof and the lead slugs from his 
jacket pocket. “He’d sent several 
limericks in. Evidently, the editor 
threw most of them away. This one 



he had set iip to use as a filler.” 
Rick put the things on the section 
head’s desk and sat down, yawning. 

David Banning read, “Rueben: 
Did the cyclone hurt your bam 
any? Hiram: Don’t know, we ain’t 
found it yet.” He scowled at Rick 
Flavelle. “What the hell is this?” 
Rick said, “Down at the bottom. 
The limerick signed Cassandra. 
This is a galley proof of fillers, 
mostly jokes.” 

“Oh.” The chiefs eyes scanned 
down. 

It was a long time before he 
looked up, his face empty. He said, 
flatly, “Where’ ve you been the past 
couple of hours?” 

“Driving back from Waterport.” 
“Evidently, you didn’t have your 
car radio on. Number One. He was 
making a speech in Kharkov on the 
current near-famine. He’s been 
hated in the Ukraine since the 
liquidation of the kulaks back in 
the early thirties.” 

Rick Flavelle hissed through his 
teeth. 

“He’s dead,’’ Banning said. 
“The Ukraine is in full revolt. Frol 
Stolechnikov has taken over in 
Moscow. How long his coalition 
will last is anybody’s guess.” 

Rick breathed, “Zowie. I thought 
the guy was in like Flynn. That he’d 
last forever.” Then the implications 
hit him. “But . hey . this 
limerick. It must have been written, 
well, at least a week or two ago.” 
His chief was staring down at it. 
For the moment he didn’t answer. 



NOSTRADAMUS

When he did, it was to say, “The 
news commentators had it that 
when the riot got out of control, 
Number One’s bodyguard tried to 
cover him while he attempted to 
take evasive action in getting back 
to his armored car.’’ 

Rick said, so low as hardly to be 
heard, “But he should have zigged 
when he zagged.’’ 

Banning shook his heavy head, 
as though to clear it. “Look, you 
saw this fellow. This Cassandra — ’’ 

“His name’s Frankie. Jerome 
Frankie.’’ 

“What does he do?” 

“He’s a clerk in a department 
store. I — ’’ 

“Don’t be dense, Richard. What 
does he do? How does he write 
these ...” 

Rick Flavelle was shaking his 
head. “He doesn’t do anything. He 
didn’t know what I was talking 
about when I mentioned Mike 
Corbin. It simply never occurred to 
him that his limerick fitted exactly 
Secretary Donaldson’s assassina- 
tion.” 

“He pulled the wool over your 
eyes!” 

“Jerry Frankie couldn’t pull the 
wool over a sheepdog’s eyes. I keep 
telling you — he’s an old maid who 
writes lousy poems to get the ego- 
boo from seeing them printed in the 
local paper.” 

Banning stared at him. 

“But he’s hit it twice in a row! 
Once, yes. Wild coincidence. But 
twice, no!” 



The section chief jabbed out a 
hand toward his phone, but before 
he could pick it up it rang. He said 
into it, impatiently, “Yes, yes.” He 
turned to Rick. “It’s for you. From 
Waterport.” 

Rick took it, mystified. “Water- 
port?” 

A voice said, “Mr. Flavelle? This 
is Ernie Semple. The Star.” 

“Yes, of course. What ...” 
“Look, after you left I found 
another one of those half-baked 
limericks of Jerry’s. The linotypist 
had it. Hadn’t set it up yet.” 

There was a first edge of tight- 
ness in Rick Flavelle’s belly. He 
said, “Just a minute.” He reached 
over for the galley proof and turned 
it on its face, took up a pen from 
the chiefs desk set. He said, “Read 
it to me, Semple.” 

After he had hung up, he reread 
what he had written and pushed it 
toward his superior. He said, “That 
was the editor of the Star. He 
located another of Frankie’s lim- 
ericks.” 

His chief bug-eyed it. Read it 
again. And then again. 

“But this one doesn’t make 
sense.” 

Rick said, “No. Neither did the 
other two, until after it happened. 
Then they made plenty of sense.” 
“But this last line. Whilst 
Gabriel tootled his horn. ” 

“Yeah. I wonder if you’re inter- 
preting it the same way I am.” 
They stared at each other. Cold 
fear filled the room. •

Dear Editor, 

Since the Panshins’ column 
lapsed in Fantastic, many s-f read- 
ers were hoping for some other 
avenue of intelligent s-f criticism. 
They have received mixed blessings 
in Reginald Bretnor’s Science Fic- 
tion, Today and Tomorrow (New 
York: Harper & Row, 1974) and 
David Ketterer’s New Worlds for 
Old: The Apocalyptic Imagination, 
Science Fiction, and American Lit-

chor Press/Doubleday, 1974). 

Bretnor’s volume is described as 
a “Discursive symposium’’; what 
we get is a series of articles dealing 
with different aspects of science 
fiction. The articles vary in quality 
and interest. The best are Frederik 
Pohl’s The Publishing of Science 
Fiction and Theodore Sturgeon’s 
Science Fiction, Morals, and Re- 
ligion. These two articles alone are 
worth the price of admission. 

The problem with a volume like 
this one is that one wishes for 
articles that this volume suggests 
but does not include. Where are 
Harlan Ellison, Gene Roddenberry, 
and David Gerrold on Sf and TV? 



Where is Roger Elwood on Anthol- 
ogist and SF? Where is Roger 
Zelazny and Samuel Delaney on 
Language and SF? 

David Ketterer’s book is pre- 
sented as “among the first sustain- 
ed critical examinations of science 
fiction.’’ I wish this were so, we 
need it. But what we get instead is 
“scholarly’’ treatments of such 
writers of s-f as: Edgar Allen Poe, 
Charles Brockden Brown, Mark 
Twain, Herman Melville and Jack 
London. Sounds like one of those 
Freshman English volumes of “Es- 
says on American Literature” 
doesn’t it? 

Ketterer delivers a few snatches 
of solid s-f criticism when he 
examines Ursula LeGuin, Philip K. 
Dick, and Walter M. Miller, Jr. 
When Ketterer deals with these 
authors we get some fine insight 
and intelligent commentary. The 
problem is that Ketterer’s book is 
largely a critique of American 
Literature: his treatments of con- 
temporary s-f seem digressions 
rather than the true center of 
Ketterer’s critical focus. 

We have here two volumes deal- 
ing with s-f: one of uneven quality, 
the other with flashes of brilliance 
amid “scholarly” criticism. Neither 
volume is entirely satisfactory. 

Perhaps this might be a good 
time for Galaxy and If io initiate a 
column of s-f criticism. Theodore 
Sturgeon’s fine column is good, but 
not enough; perhaps Sturgeon 
could become resident critic while

HUE AND CRY, con’t. 

Lester del Rey could increase his 
book reviews to include both maga- 
zines. 

For s-f to improve, there must be 
intelligent criticism. Mere book re- 
viewing is not criticism. S-f needs 
feedback; I hope Galaxy and If 
choose to lead the way in this area.

Dear Jim Baen, , 

It has been a long time since Tve 
written a letter to //concerning edi- 
torial policies, but now that hands 
are changing maybe a humble 
reader will be heard. I think if you 
look at circulation figures you will 
see both /f and Galaxy were at their 
highest when Fred Pohl was run- 
ning things. In ’69 the circijlation 
figures dropped about 50% for 
both mags — that was the year Fred 
stepped down. Since then, although 
I’ve still found Galaxy and If the 
best mags around, they have had a 
dead quality which leaves the reader 
with the idea that nobody cares. I 
like editorials, I like letter columns 
and it is great to see an editor- 
reader relationship. It ^ means we 
are being listened to. That editors 
do care. 

I think you should take a few 
minutes and go back to The Pohl 



years (/ read each issue — as it was 
published! ed.) and have a look at 
the way he put the mag together. 
There was excitement then: you 
couldn’t wait for the next copy. 
(Now I go get the next issue hoping 
that it will be better than the last — 
and am usually disappointed.) 

The mags need a breath of life. 
What about serial type stories, like 
the Riverworld series or the Gree or 
Retief? I don’t suggest reviving 
those but something along that 
line. Please, //used to have a feel 
like it was put together to excite 
you, make you feel important, that 
you counted — I don’t know — but 
there was charm there that got the 
mag the Hugo three times in a row. 
It didn’t look as good as it -does 
now, but the art work was five 
times better than what’s been used 
lately. 

I hope I’m not boring you but 
look at a ’67 issue of //for e.g. the 
June issue. There is an editorial, a 
Fandom article, a few pages of 
letters, plus an end-off summation 
by the editor, “And that ties most 
of our own loose ends this month. 
We’re hoping . .’’ etc. That kind 
of informality. We loved it then — 
we’d love it now. 

And don’t think I mean an 
Amazing-type format either. I don’t 
like Amazing because of an almost 
snobby editorial feel and a cry-baby 
attitude. Sure, it’s not the hottest 
thing around but it could sell better 
than it does. 

I’ll even suggest a department for 



170 



IF 




If. How about a reader column that 
devotes itself to, and only to, 
debates, etc. on the books and 
stories published in the field? A 
good science department is missing 
from Galaxy and a “coming next 
month” is really a great hook into 
the next issue. 

Well, with all that plus your own 
ideas on what an SF mag should be 
I hope for a return to the adven- 
tures of reading T/^and look forward 
with great expectations to the June 
/^which I’ve heard is the first 
complete issue you’ve put together. 

All my best, 
Nicholas Grimshawe 



The column you suggest seems to 
me to fill precisely the role I en- 
vision for {the new and revised) Hue 
and Cry. Nothing so restrictive as a 
format of course, but I do plan to 
print only those letters which have 
something to say about sf, and I 
intend to print a few of those each 
issue. {Of course I can t print' em if 
you don't write' em ...) If some- 
body wants to refer to a letter in a 
previous issue — by all means! 

— Baen 



Dear Ejler, 

There are a number of good 
women writers in the field of s-f. 
My only disappointment is that I’m 
not seeing enough from them. 
Joanna Russ is great, and so is 



Ursula K. LeGuin. Pamela Sargent 
is up and coming. Doris Piserchia’s 
Mr. Justice has been mentioned for 
a Hugo nomination. Lisa Tuttle 
was among the new writers nomi- 
nated for the Campbell Award last 
year. Kate Wilhelm, along with 
Lafferty and Wolfe, is one of the 
top three writers appearing regu- 
larly in Orbit. Sonya Dorman, 
Dvora Olmstead, Mildred Downey 
Broxon, Janet Fox, Josephine Sax- 
ton, Doris Pitkin Buck, Katherine 
MacLean, Christine F. Hensel, 
Vonda Mclntire, Betsy Curtis and 
Marion Zimmer Bradley, all had s-f 
stories or novels out in 1973. 

The trouble is they don’t appear 
often enough. And writers such as 
Suzanna Haden Elgin, Susan K. 
Putney and P. A. Zoline may al- 
ready be lost to the field. Plus, a 
number of women are using their 
initials, etc. What is this? The 19th 
century? 

I’m not asking you to assume a 
bias for the works of the women 
who contribute manuscripts. I’m 
asking you to print this letter so 
that more writing comes in from 
women. As a group they appear to 
be doing better than the men cur- 
rently writing s-f. 

Sincerely, 
John Robinson 

As did my predecessor, I plan to 
publish what I consider to be the 
best of those manuscripts sub- 
mitted. Period. — Baen

An Editorial Appeal 

Commencing with the June issues, Galaxy and Worlds of If 
will begin to fully show the results of an entirely new editorial 
policy. For example, the combined author line-up for June reads 
like a Who’s Who of the field: Isaac Asimov, James Blish, Alexei 
and Cory Panshin, Fred Pohl, Lester del Rey, Mack Reynolds, 
Fred Saberhagen, James H. Schmitz, Robert Silverberg, Ted 
Sturgeon, Jack Williamson — and more! No mean list, I think 
you’ll agree. 

Check the contents-pages (themselves so changed as to be 
virtual new features) and you will find several additions. 

Galaxy: Forum, a platform for sf and/or science notables who 
feel they have something important — and interesting! — to convey 
to the readership; Interface, an intermittent series of interviews 
cum thumbnail biographies by Ted Sturgeon (scheduled to begin 
in July with an interview of Roger Elwood); Showcase,, (also 
scheduled for July) a non-verbal feature — a new piece of sf-art 
by an acknowledged master, which has as its only justification 
that its creator thinks it’s something special. And of course Book- 
shelf, Directions and Galaxy Stars will continue to flourish as of 
yore — ^more than yore, in fact. 

Worlds of If: The Alien Viewpoint, an insider’s view of sf. 
Crusty, hard-bitten, cynical old Dick Geis (Editor/Publisher of 
The Alien Critic) lays it on the line — ^his opinions are not neces- 
sarily those of the management! Ars Gratia, much like Galaxy 
Showcase, but for Up-and-Comers; Future Perfect, next issue’s 
goodies — at least some of them; The Editors Page in June is 
devoted to my personal favorite among the many past editors of 
Worlds of If. In future, it will be what the name implies — the 
editor’s page. And, as with Galaxy, all the old features will re- 
main in residence. 

But all of this takes money, a good deal of it — and the profit 
motive remains an operant factor in the publishing industry. To 



over 





demonstrate that publishing the two best sf magazines in the 
world is an economically viable policy requires a significant in- 
crease in circulation figures. You can help — and in the process 
receive at a significant discount 12 or 24 issues of the best sf 
published anywhere, weeks before it appears for public sale. Just 
fill in the coupon below. — ^Baen
