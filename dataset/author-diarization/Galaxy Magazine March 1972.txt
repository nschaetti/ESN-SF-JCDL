EDITOR'S PAGE 



//—during a duologue on science 
fiction in January, 1971 (please 
mark the date) Robert Silverberg 
had not happened to mention an 
impossible isotope, Plutonium- 186, 
and . 

If Isaac Asimov had not hap- 
pened to be in the audience to hear 
him. 

. Then you wouldn’t now be on 
to the first publication anywhere of 
The Gods Themselves, a pro- 
foundly wise novel beginning in 
this issue of Galaxy — virtually on 
the anniversary of the remark that 
launched it. 

//—the companion magazine of 
Galaxy — will carry part two of 
The Gods Themselves in order to 
enable us to make available to 
you the entire work before hard- 
cover publication — and also for 
another and deeper reason. 

You and I live on the edge of im- 
ponderables and each move we 
make — or fail to make — creates 
circumstances that never existed 
before. Usually these remain un- 
noticed or at least unsung unless 
our two worlds either jostle or join 
or we find ourselves poised over an 
abyss of our own making. Then, 
suddenly, if can become the longest 
word in the language. 

The Gods Themselves came to 
be written, by the author’s own 
account, because he felt challenged 
to put Plutonium- 186 to work, 
once the unworkable concept had 
been introduced against all the 
laws of Earthly science. The pro- 
ject began as a short story but as 



it unfolded Dr. Asimov found 
that he had to create a whole new 
Universe to contain the outlaw 
chemical. 

Part two of the book is set en- 
tirely in this alternate or parallel 
Universe, where you and 1 would 
be as impossible as Plutonium- 186 
is in the cosmos we inhabit. Dr. 
Asimov’s para-Universe is meticu- 
lously based in solid science, though 
nothing in it obeys the laws of our 
cosmos. 

So that section truly belongs 
in If— The Magazine of Alterna- 
tives, which is governed by laws of 
the imagination — as valid as the 
human mind. 

Part three, on the other hand, 
which again is ruled by the science 
of our cosmos — though not exactly 
that of Earth — wjll appear in the 
next issue of Galaxy — a magazine 
similarly ruled. 

#Has it occurred to you recently 
that if we continue our currently 
rapacious, civilized course you 
and I, by best available estimates, 
will represent the sole remaining 
mammalian life forms left on the 
planet by the year 2000? 

Man may be the least objectively 
studied mammal on Earth. We 
cloak ourselves in aspirations and 
under this cover — apparently while 
looking the other way — have made 
ourselves possibly the major na- 
tural force threatening not only 
the planet but ourselves. 

The word for what we live by 
is Overkill. 

Reader Cy Chauvin of Roseville, 
Michigan, points to a trend in 
recent science fiction in an excel- 



4 




lent letter in Directions (see page 
176). 

Without disagreeing with Mr. 
Chauvin I would like to put up for 
grabs the thought that the workings 
not only of the human mind but 
also of the mindless human chem- 
istry have begun to assume a de- 
vastating importance. And that 
science fiction is moving — not 
toward mainstream but through it 
to the position of leadership it 
has traditionally held in pertinence 
and significance. 



To support this view, may I 
refer you again to right now and — 
The Gods Themselves'}

GODS 
THEMSELVES 



Who had forged the link between our 
Universe and theirs? The fate of man, 
and all his stars, hung on the answer! 



ISAAC ASIMOV 



PART ONE 



“Against stupidity .

GOOD,” said Lamont sharply. “I didn’t get anywhere.” 
He had a brooding look about him that went with his deep- 
set eyes and the slight asymmetry of his long chin. The look was 
part of him at the best of times — and this was not the best of times. 



7 



His second formal interview with Hallam had been a greater fiasco 
than the first. 

“Don’t be dramatic,’’ said Myron Bronowski placidly. “You 
didn’t expect to get anywhere. You told me so.’’ He was tossing 
peanuts into the air and catching them in his plump-lipped mouth 
as they came down. He never missed. He was not very tall, not very 
thin. 

“That doesn’t make it pleasant. But you’re right, it doesn’t mat- 
ter. There are other things I can do and intend to do. Besides, I 
depend on you. If you could only find out — ’’ 

“Don’t finish, Pete. I’ve heard it all before. All I have to do is 
decipher the thinking of a non-human intelligence.’’ 

“A Z>e//er-than-human intelligence. That much I’ve established. 
And those creatures in the para-Universe are trying to make them- 
selves understood.’’ 

“That may be — ’’ Bronowski sighed — “but they’re trying to do it 
through my intelligence, which is better than human I sometimes 
think, though not much. Sometimes I lie awake in the dark of the 
night and wonder if different intelligences can communicate at all — 
or, if I’ve had a particularly bad day, whether the phrase "different 
intelligences’ has meaning at all.’’ 

“It does,’’ said Lamont savagely, hands clearly balling into fists 
and bulging his lab-coat pockets. “It means Hallam and me. It 
means that fools’ hero. Dr. Frederick Hallam, versus me. We’re 
different intelligences. I know because when I talk to him he doesn’t 
understand. His idiot face gets redder and his eyes protrude and his 
ears block. I’d say his mind stops functioning, but I lack the proof 
that it is ever in any other state.’’ 

Bronowski murmured, “What a way to speak of the Father of the 
Electron Pump.’’ 

“That’s it. Reputed Father of the Electron Pump. A bastard birth 
if ever there was one. His contribution was least in substance. I 
know." 

“I know, too. You’ve told me often” 

Bronowski tossed another peanut into the air. He didn’t miss. 

Thirty years earlier, he reflected, Frederick Hallam had been a 
radiochemist, the print on his doctoral dissertation still wet and 
he giving no sign whatever of being a world-shaker.

GALAXY

W HAT began the shaking of 
the world was the fact that a 
dusty reagent bottle marked Tung- 
sten-186 stood on Hallam’s desk. 
It was not his. He had never used 
it. It was a legacy from the dim 
past when for some long-forgotten 
reason an equally forgotten inhabi- 
tant of the office had wanted pure, 
separated isotope 186 of tungsten 
instead of the usual mixture of iso- 
topes. The bottle’s content was not 
even really tungsten any more. It 
consisted of small pellets heavily 
layered with oxide — gray and dusty. 
No use to anyone. 

And one day Hallam entered the 
laboratory (well, it was October 3, 
2070, to be exact) got to work, 
stopped shortly before 10 a.m., 
stared transfixed at the bottle and 
lifted it. It was as dusty as ever, the 
label as faded, but he called out, 
“Goddamn it — who the hell has 
been tampering with this?” 

That, at least, was the account of 
Denison, who overheard the re- 
mark and who repeated it to La- 
mont a generation later. The official 
saga of the discovery, as reported 
in the books, leaves out the phrase- 
ology. From history one gets the 
impression of a keen-eyed chemist 
aware of change — and instantly 
drawing deep deductions. 

Not so. Hallam had no use for 
the tungsten. It was of no value and 
any tampering with it could be of 
no possible importance to him. 



However, it had once been costly 
and had become something of a 
status symbol to him. Also, he 
hated any interference with his desk 
(as so many do) and he suspected 
others of possessing keen desires to 
engage in such interference out of 
sheer malice. 

No one at the time admitted to 
knowing anything about the mat- 
ter. Benjamin Allan Denison, who 
had overheard the initial remark, 
had an office immediately across 
the corridor and both his and Hal- 
lam’s doors were open. He looked 
up and met Hallam’s accusatory 
eye. 

He did not particularly like Hal- 
lam (no one particularly did) and 
Denison had slept badly the night 
before. He was, as it happened and 
as he later recalled, rather pleased 
to have someone on whom to vent 
spleen. Hallam made the perfect 
candidate. 

When Hallam held the bottle up 
to his face Denison pulled back 
with clear distaste. “Why the devil 
should I be interested in your 
tungsten?” he demanded. “Why 
should anyone? If you’ll look at the 
bottle you’ll see that the thing 
hasn’t been opened for twenty 
years — and if you hadn’t put your 
own grubby paws on it you would 
have seen no one has touched it.” 

Hallam flushed a slow, angry red. 
He said tightly, “Listen, Denison, 
someone has changed the contents. 
That’s not the tungsten.” 

Denison allowed himself a small 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



9 




but distinct sniff. “How would you 
know?” 

Of such things — petty annoy- 
ances and aimless thrusts — is 
history made. 

It would have been an unfortu- 
nate remark in any case. Denison’s 
scholastic record, as fresh as Hal- 
lam’s, was far more impressive and 
he was the bright young man of the 
department. Hallam knew this and, 
what was worse, Denison knew it, 
too, and made no secret of his 
awareness. Denison’s How would 
you know? with the clear and un- 
mistakable emphasis on the you 
was ample motivation for all that 
followed. Without it Hallam would 
never have become the greatest and 
most revered scientist in history, 
to employ the exact phrase Denison 
later used in his interview with 
Lamont. 

Officially Hallam had come in 
on that fateful morning, noticed 
the dusty gray pellets gone — not 
even the dust on the inside surface 
of the bottle remaining — and clear 
iron-gray metal in their place. 
Naturally he investigated. 

But place the official version to 
one side. It was Denison, who 
supplied Hallam’s real motivation. 
Had Denison confined himself to a 
simple negative — or a shrug — the 
chances are that Hallam would 
have asked others, would eventually 
have wearied of the unexplained 
event, would have put the bottle to 
one side and let subsequent tragedy, 
whether subtle or drastic (depend- 



ing on how long the ultimate dis- 
covery was delayed), guide the 
future. In any event, it would not 
have been Hallam who rode the 
whirlwind to the heights. 

With Denison’s, “How would 
you know?” cutting him down to 
size, however, Hallam could only 
retort wildly, “I’ll showyoM that I 
know.” 

And after that nothing could pre- 
vent him from going to extremes. 
The analysis of the metal in the old 
container became his number-one 
priority, and his prime goal became 
to wipe the haughtiness from Deni- 
son’s thin-nosed face and the per- 
petual trace of a sneer from his 
pale lips. 

D enison never forgot that 
moment — or that it was his 
own remark that drove Hallam to 
the Nobel Prize and himself to 
oblivion. He was to discover that 
there was an overwhelming stub- 
bornness in Hallam, the medi- 
ocrity’s frightened need to safeguard 
his pride, that would carry the 
day against all Denison’s native 
brilliance. 

Hallam moved at once and 
directly. He carried his pellets to 
the mass spectrography depart- 
ment. For a radiation chemist the 
move was natural. He knew the 
technicians, had worked with them, 
and he was forceful. He was force- 
ful to such an effect, indeed, that 
the job was placed ahead of pro- 



10 



GALAXY 




jects of much greater pith and 
moment. 

The mass spectrographer said 
eventually, “Well, it isn’t tungsten.’’ 
Hallam’s broad and humorless 
face wrinkled into a harsh smile. 
“All right. We’ll tell that to bright- 
boy Denison. I want a report 
and—’’ 

“But wait a while. Dr. Hallam. 
Give us a little time. I’m telling you 
it’s not tungsten, but that doesn’t 
mean I know what it is.’’ 

“What do you mean you don’t 
know what it is?’’ 

“I mean the results are ridicu- 
lous.’’ The technician thought for 
a moment. “Impossible, actually. 
The charge-mass ratio is all 
wrong.’’ 

“All wrong in what way?’’ 

“Too high. It just can’t be.’’ 
“Well, then,’’ said Hallam and — 
regardless of the motive that was 
driving him — his next words set 
him on the road to the Nobel Prize 
and with some Justice, “get the 
frequency of its characteristic 
x-radiation and figure out the 
charge. Don’t just sit around and 
talk about something being 
impossible.’’ 

It was a troubled technician who 
came into Hallam’s office a few 
days later. 

Hallam ignored the look on the 
other’s face — he was never sensi- 
tive — and said, “Did you find — ’’ 
He cast an uneasy glance at Deni- 
son, who was sitting at the desk in 
his own lab across the hall. Hal- 



lam shut his office door. “Did you 
find the nuclear charge?’’ 

“Yes, but it’s wrong.’’ 

“All right, Tracy. Do it over.’’ 

“I did it over a dozen times. It’s 
still wrong.’’ 

“If you made a measurement, 
that’s it. Don’t argue with facts.’’ 
Tracy rubbed his ear and said, 
“I’ve got to. Doc. If I take the 
measurements seriously — then 
what you’ve given me is plutonium- 
186.’’ 

“Plutonium- 1 86? Plutonium- 
186?’’ 

“The charge is +94. The mass is 
186.” 

“But that’s impossible. There’s 
no such isotope. There can’t be.” 
“That’s what I’m saying to you. 
But those are the measurements.” 
“But a situation like that leaves 
the nucleus over fifty neutrons 
short. You can’t have plutonium- 
186. You couldn’t squeeze 94 pro- 
tons into one nucleus with only 92 
neutrons and expect it to hang 
together for even a trillion-trillionth 
of a second.” 

“That’s what I’m telling you. 
Doc,” said Tracy patiently. 

And then Hallam stopped to 
think. It was tungsten he was mis- 
sing and tungsten- 186 was stable. 
Tungsten- 186 had 74 protons and 
112 neutrons in its nucleus. Could 
something have turned twenty neu- 
trons into twenty protons? Surely 
that was impossible. 

“Are there any signs of radio- 
activity?” asked Hallam, groping 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



11 




somehow for a road out of the 
maze. 

“I thought of that,” said the 
technician. “It’s stable. Absolutely 
stable.” 

“Then it can’t be plutonium- 
186.” 

“I keep telling you, Doc.” 
Hallam said, hopelessly, “Well, 
give me the stuff.” 

A lone once more, he sat and 
L looked at the bottle in stupe- 
faction. The most nearly stable 
isotope of plutonium was pluton- 
ium-240, where 146 neutrons were 
needed to make the 94 protons 
stick together with some semblance 
of partial stability. 

What could he do now? It was 
beyond him and he was sorry he 
had started. After all, he had real 
work begging to be done, and this 
thing — this mystery — had nothing 
to do with him. Tracy had made 
some stupid mistake or the mass- 
spectrometer was out of whack 
or. 

Well, what of it? Forget the 
whole thing. 

Except that Hallam knew he 
would not be allowed to forget. 
Sooner or later Denison would be 
bound to stop by and, with that 
irritating half-smile of his, ask 
about the tungsten. Then what 
could Hallam say? 

He could say. It isn’t tungsten, 
just as / told you. 

Surely Denison would ask. Oh, 
and what is it, thenl 



And nothing imaginable could 
make Hallam expose himself to 
the kind of derision that would fol- 
low any claim that it was plu- 
tonium-186. He had to find out 
what it was and he had to do it 
himself. Clearly he could trust 
no one. 

So about two weeks later he 
entered Tracy’s laboratory in what 
can fairly be described as a first- 
class fury. 

“Hey, didn’t you tell me that 
stuff was non-radioactive?” 

“What stuff?” asked Tracy auto- 
matically — before he remembered. 

“That stuff you called plutonium- 
186,” said Hallam. 

“Oh. Well, it was stable.” 
“About as stable as your mental 
state. If you call this non-radio- 
active, you belong in a plumber’s 
shop.” 

Tracy frowned. “Okay, Doc. 
Pass it over and let’s try.” And then 
he said, “Beats me! It is radioac- 
tive. Not much, but it is. I don’t 
see how I could have missed that.” 
“And how far can I trust your 
nonsense about plutonium- 186?” 
The matter had Hallam by the 
throat now. The mystery had be- 
come so exasperating as to be a 
personal affront. Whoever had 
switched bottles, or switched con- 
tents, must either have switched 
again or devised a metal for the 
specific purpose of making a fool 
of him. In either case he was ready 
to pull the world apart, if necessary, 
to solve the puzzle . 



12 



GALAXY 




He had his stubbornness and an 
intensity of drive that could not 
easily be brushed aside. He went 
straight to G. C. Kantrowitsch, 
who was then in the final years of 
his own rather remarkable career. 
Kantrowitsch’s aid was difficult to 
enlist but, once enlisted, it quickly 
caught fire. 

Two days later, in fact, Kantro- 
witsch was storming into Hallam’s 
office in a blaze of excitement. 
“Have you been handling this thing? 



Think! Well, answer, will you?” 
“Not much,” said Hallam. 
“Well, don’t. It’s emitting 
positrons.” 

“Oh?” 

“The most energetic positrons 
I’ve ever seen. And your figures on 
its radioactivity are low.” 

“Too low?” 

“Distinctly. And what bothers 
me is that every measurement I 
take is just a trifle higher than the 
one before.” 



6 (continued) 

B RONOWSKI came across an apple in the capacious pocket 
of his jacket and bit into it. “Okay, you’ve seen Hallam and 
been kicked out as expected. What next?” 

“I haven’t quite decided. But \yhatever it is, it’s going to dump 
him on his fat behind. I saw him once before, you know — years 
ago when I first came here — when I thought he was a great man. 
A great man? He’s the greatest villain in the history of science. He’s 
rewritten the history of the Pump, you know, rewritten it here — ” 
Lament tapped his temple. “He believes his own fantasy and fights 
for it with a diseased fury. He’s a pygmy with only one talent, the 
ability to convince others he’s a giant.” 

Lament looked at Bronowski’s wide and placid face, wreathed 
now in amusement, and forced a laugh. “Oh, well, that doesn’t do 
any good — and I’ve told it all to you before anyway.” 

“Many times,” agreed Bronowski. 

“But it just gravels me to have the whole world — ” 



P IETER LAMONT had been 
two years old when Hallam had 
picked up his altered tungsten for 
the first time. When he was twenty- 
five he joined Pump Station One, 



the print on his own doctoral dis- 
sertation still fresh, and accepted a 
simultaneous appointment to the 
distinguished physics faculty of 
the University. 

It was a remarkably satisfactory 
achievement for the young man.

Pump Station One lacked the glit- 
ter of later stations but it was the 
grandaddy of them all, of the entire 
chain that now girdled the planet, 
though the entire technology was 
only a couple of decades old. No 
major technological advance had 
ever caught hold so rapidly — and 
why not? The Pump meant free and 
limitless energy without pollution 
problems. It was both the Santa 
Claus and the Aladdin’s Lamp of 
the whole world. 

Lamont had taken the job in 
order to delve into problems of the 
highest theoretical abstraction — yet 
he found himself growing vitally 
interested in the amazing story of 
the development of the Electron 
Pump. It had never been written 
up in its entirety by anyone who 
truly understood the theoretical 
principles (in so far as they could be 
understood) and who had some 
ability in translating the Pump’s 
complexities for the general public. 
To be sure, Hallam himself had 
written a number of articles for 
the popular media, but these did 
not represent a connected, reasoned 
history — something that Lamont 
yearned to supply. 

He used Hallam’s articles to be- 
gin with, other reminiscences in 
published form — the official docu- 
ments, so to speak — carrying them 
through to Hallam’s world-shaking 
remark, the Great Insight, as it was 
often called (invariably with cap- 
ital letters). 

Afterward, of course, when La- 



mont had experienced his disil- 
lusionment, he began digging 
deeper and the question arose in 
his mind as to whether Hallam’s 
great remark had really been Hal- 
lam’s. It had been advanced at the 
seminar that marked the true be- 
ginning of the Electron Pump and 
yet, as it turned out, it was extra- 
ordinarily difficult to get the de- 
tails of that seminar and quite 
impossible to get the voice re- 
cordings. 

Eventually Lamont began to 
suspect that the dim footprints left 
on the sands of time by that semi- 
nar were not entirely accidental. 
Putting several items ingeniously 
together, he found reasonable evi- 
dence that one John F. X. McFar- 
land had said something very much 
like the crucial statement Hallam 
had made — and had done so before 
Hallam. 

He went to see McFarland, who 
was featured not at all in the official 
accounts and who was now doing 
upper-atmosphere research, with 
particular reference to the solar 
wind. His was not a top-echelon 
job, but it had its perquisites and 
it had more than a little to do with 
Pump effects. McFarland had 
clearly avoided suffering the fate 
of oblivion that had overtaken 
Denison. 

He was polite enough to Lamont 
and willing to talk on any subject 
except the events of that seminar. 
Those he simply didn’t remember. 

Lamont insisted, quoted the per- 



14 



GALAXY 




suasive evidence he had gathered. 

McFarland took out a pipe, 
filled it, inspected its contents 
thoroughly and said with an odd 
intentness, “I don’t choose to 
remember because it doesn’t mat- 
ter — it really doesn’t. Suppose I 
laid claim to having said some- 
thing. No one would believe it. I 
would look like an idiot — and a 
megalomaniacal one.” 

“And Hallam would see to it that 
you were retired?” 

“I’m not saying that, but I don’t 
see that it would do me any good. 
What’s the difference anyway?” 

“A matter of historical truth,” 
said Lamont. 

“Oh, bull. The historical truth is 
that Hallam never let go. He 
drove everyone into investigating, 
whether they wanted to or not. 
Without him that tungsten would 
eventually have exploded — with I 
don’t know how many casualties. 
There might never have been an- 
other sample and we might never 
have had the Pump. Hallam de- 
serves the credit for it even if he 
doesn’t deserve the credit. And I 
can’t help it if that doesn’t make 
sense. History often doesn’t make 
sense.” 

Lamont was not satisfied with 
McFarland’s answer but he had to 
make it do. McFarland simply 
would say no more. 

Historical truth? 

One piece of historical truth that 
seemed beyond question was that 
it was the radioactivity that pulled

ONE the titles we were iooking for- 
ward to for January was Why the 
Telephone is Driving You Crazy, but 
there's many a slip between type- 
writer and hope; or maybe the road to 
hell is really lined with typewriters . 
Anyway, we do have a delightful ad- 
venture fantasy by Philip Jose Farmer 
titled Time's Last Gift — mostly for fun 
but with a poperoo ending. And T.L. 
Sherred has contributed an inimitable 
collection. First Person Peculiar.

IN THE adult fantasy department we 
have an ancient goodie — The World's 
Desire, by Rider Haggard and Andrew 
Lang — all about what happens to 
Odysseus after he gets home and finds 
it isn't there. (He goes right out and 
starts chasing women. Very ther- 
apeutic.) Then there’s something 
called Peacock Manure and Marigolds 
(growing vegetables sans pesticides) 
and one of those ghastly life-shorten- 
ing type books. Enzymes and Asbestos. 
It gets to you after a while . The 
insidious idiocies of our age may well 
be one of the reasons why people like 
to read about the forthright problems 
of fantasy. 

JANUARY sees the official ending of 
our Fall '71 list — and February, the

Lovecraft devotees may be annoyed 
since this is no volume of slavish

“Hallam’s tungsten” (this is what 
it was called as a matter of histori- 
cal custom) into the big time. It 
didn’t matter whether it was or was 
not tungsten, whether it had or had 
not been tampered with — even 
whether it was or was not an im- 
possible isotope. Everything was 
swallowed up in the miraculousness 
of something— anything — that 
showed a constantly increasing in- 
tensity of radioactivity under cir- 
cumstances that ruled out the 
existence of any type of radioactive 
breakdown in any number of steps 
then known. 

After a while Kantrowitsch mut- 
tered, “We’d better spread it out. 
If we keep it in sizable lumps it will 
vaporize or explode, or both, and 
contaminate half the city.” 

So it was powdered and scattered 
and mixed with ordinary tungsten 
at first. Then, when the tungsten 
grew radioactive in its turn, it was 
mixed with graphite which had a 
lower cross-section to the radiation. 

Less than two months after Hal- 
1am noticed the change in the bot- 
tle’s contents Kantrowitsch, in a 
communication to the editor of 
Nuclear Reviews, with Hallam’s 
name appended as co-author, 
announced the existence of plu- 
tonium- 186. Tracy’s original 
determination was thus vindicated 
but his name was not mentioned, 
either then or later. With that, Hal- 
lam’s tungsten began to receive epic 
attention, and Denison began to 
note the changes that ended by 



16 



GALAXY 




making him into a non-person. 

The existence of plutonium- 186 
was bad enough. For it to have been 
stable at the start and to display a 
curiously increasing radioactivity 
was much worse. 

A seminar to handle the problem 
was organized. Kantrowitsch was 
in the chair — an interesting histor- 
ical note, for it was the last time in 
the official saga of the Electron 
Pump that a major meeting was 
held in connection with it and 
chaired by anyone but Hallam. As 
a matter of fact, Kantrowitsch died 
five months later and the only 
personality with sufficient prestige 
to keep Hallam in the shade was 
removed. 

T he meeting was extraordi- 
narily fruitless until Hallam 
announced his Great Insight. But 
in the version as reconstructed by 
Lamont the real turning point came 
during the luncheon break. At that 
time McFarland, who is not cred- 
ited with any remarks in the official 
records, although he was listed as 
an attendee, said, “You know, 
what we need is a litlle bit of fan- 
tasy here. Suppose — ” 

He was speaking to Diderick van 
Klemens and Van Klemens re- 
ported the conversation sketchily 
in a kind of personal shorthand in 
his own notes. Long before Lamont 
had succeeded in tracking that 
down Van Klemens was dead. And 
though the notes convinced Lamont 
himself that the Great Insight had 



not originated with Hallam, he had 
to admit they would not add up to a 
convincing story by themselves. 
There was no way of proving that 
Hallam had seen them or had over- 
heard McFarland’s remarks to 
Van Klemens. Lamont would have 
been willing to bet a fortune that 
Hallam had been within earshot of 
the conversation but that willing- 
ness proved nothing. 

And then, suppose Lamont could 
prove his point. The revelation 
might hurt Hallam’s egregious 
pride, but it could not really shake 
his position. It would be argued 
that to McFarland the remark was 
only fantasy — it was Hallam who 
accepted it as something more. It 
was Hallam who was willing to 
stand up in front of the group and 
say it officially and risk the derision 
that might be his. McFarland 
would surely never have dreamed 
of placing himself on official 
record with his “little bit of 
fantasy.” 

Lamont might have counter- 
argued that McFarland was a 
well-known nuclear physicist with 
a reputation to lose, while Hallam 
was a young radiochemist who 
could say anything he pleased in 
nuclear physics and, as an out- 
sider, get away with it. 

In any case, this is what Hallam 
said, according to the official 
transcript: 

“Gentlemen, we are getting no- 
where. I am therefore going to 
make a suggestion, not because it 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

necessarily makes sense, but be- 
cause it represents less nonsense 
than anything else I’ve heard. We 
are faced with a substance, plu- 
tonium-186, that cannot exist at 
all, let alone as an even momentar- 
ily stable substance, if the natural 
laws of the Universe have any 
validity. It follows, then, that since 
it does indubitably exist and did 
exist as a stable substance to begin 
with, it must have existed — at 
least to begin with — in a place or at 
a time or under circumstances 
where the natural laws of the Uni- 
verse were other than they are. To 
put it, bluntly, the substance we are 
studying did not originate in our 
Universe at all, but in another an 
alternate Universe -a parallel 
Universe. Call it what you want. 

“Once here — and I don’t pretend 
to know how it got across whatever 
boundaries separate us — it was 
stable still and I suggest that this 
was because it carried the laws of 
its own Universe with it. The fact 
that it slowly became radioactive 
and then even more radioactive 
may mean that the laws of our own 
Universe slowly soaked into its 
substance, if you know what 1 
mean. 

“I point out that at the same time 
that the plutonium- 186 appeared, 
a sample of tungsten, made up of 
several stable isotopes, including 
tungsten- 186, disappeared. It may 
have slipped over into the parallel 
Universe. After all, it is logical to 
suppose that it is simpler for an 



exchange of mass to take place 
than for a one-way transfer to 
occur. In the parallel Universe, 
tungsten- 186 may be as anomalous 
as plutonium- 186 is here. It may 
begin as a stable substance and 
slowly become increasingly radio- 
active. It may serve as an energy 
source there just as plutonium- 186 
would here.’’ 

The audience must have been 
listening with considerable aston- 
ishment for there is no record of 
interruption, at least until the sen- 
tence last recorded above, at which 
time Hallam seemed to have 
paused to catch his breath and 
perhaps to wonder at his own 
temerity. 

Someone from the audience 
(presumably Antoine-Jerome 
Lapin, though the record is not 
clear) asked if Professor Hallam 
were suggesting that an intelligent 
agent in the para-Universe had 
deliberately made the exchange in 
order to obtain an energy source. 
The expression “para-Universe’’ — 
evolved apparently as an abbrevia- 
tion of “parallel-Universe’’ — thus 
entered the language. This question 
contained the first recorded use of 
the expression. 

There was a pause and then Hal- 
lam, more daring than ever, said — 
and this was the nub of the Great 
Insight — “Yes, I think so, and I 
think that the energy source cannot 
be made practical unless Universe 
and para-Universe work together, 
each at one end of a pump, pushing 



18 



GALAXY 




energy from them to us and from us 
to them, taking advantage of the 
difference in the natural laws of the 
two Universes.” 

H ALLAM had adopted the 
word “para-Universe” and 
made it his own at this point. Fur- 
thermore, he became the first to 
use the word “pump” (since in- 
variably capitalized) in connection 
with the matter. 

A tendency exists in the official 
account to give the impression that 
Hallam’s suggestion caught fire at 
once, but it did not. Those who 
were willing to discuss it at all 
would commit themselves no fur- 
ther than to say it was an amusing 
speculation. Kantrowitsch, in 
particular, did not say a word. This 
was crucial to Hallam’s career. 

Hallam could scarcely carry 
through the theoretical and prac- 
tical implications of his own sug- 
gestion all by himself. A team was 
required and it was built up. But no 
member of the team, until it was 
too late, would associate himself 
openly with what was to become 
known as the Great Insight. By the 
time success was unmistakable the 
public had grown to think of it as 
Hallam’s and Hallam’s alone. It 
was Hallam, to all the world, and 
Hallam alone, who had discovered 
the substance, experienced and 
transmitted the Great Insight — and 
it was Hallam who was the Father 
of the Electron Pump. 

Thus, in various laboratories. 



pellets of tungsten metal were laid 
out temptingly. In one out of ten 
the transfer was made and new 
supplies of plutonium- 186 were 
produced. Other elements were 
offered as bait and refused. But 
wherever the plutonium- 186 ap- 
peared and whoever it was that 
brought the supply to the central 
research organization working on 
the problem, to the public it was 
an additional quantity of “Hal- 
lam’s tungsten.” 

Again it was Hallam who pre- 
sented some aspects of the theory 
to the public most successfully. To 
his own surprise (as he later said) he 
found himself a facile writer and 
he enjoyed popularizing. Besides, 
success has its own inertia and the 
public would accept information on 
the project from no one but Hal- 
lam. In a since famous article in 
the North American Sunday Tele- 
Times Weekly, he wrote: 

We cannot say in how many 
ways the laws of the para- 
Universe differ from our own, 
but we can guess with some 
assurance that the strong nu- 
clear interaction, which serves 
to bind the nuclei of atoms to- 
gether and which is the strong- 
est known force in our Universe, 
is even stronger there; perhaps 
a hundred times stronger. This 
means that in the para-Universe 
protons are more easily held 
together against their own 
electrostatic repulsion and 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



19 




that a nucleus requires fewer 
neutrons to produce stability. 

Plutonium- 186, stable in 
their Universe, contains far too 
many protons — or too few 
neutrons — to be stable in ours 
with its weaker nuclear inter- 
action. Plutonium- 186, once in 
our Universe, begins to radiate 
positrons, particles similar to 
electrons except for having a 
positive instead of a negative 
charge. With each positron 
emitted, a proton within the 
nucleus is converted to a neu- 
tron. Eventually twenty pro- 
tons per nucleus have been 
converted to neutrons and 
plutonium- 186 has become 
tungsten- 186, which is stable 
by the laws of our Universe. 

Since opposite charges at- 
tract, the twenty positrons 
combine with twenty electrons, 
resulting in the annihilation of 
both positrons and electrons. 
Their mass is totally converted 
to energy — far safer and more 
efficient than either atomic 
fission or fusion. But with 
every atom of plutonium- 186 
sent to us, our Universe ends 
up with twenty fewer electrons. 

Meanwhile, the tungsten- 186 
that enters the para-Universe 
is unstable there for the oppo- 
site reason. By the laws of the 
para-Universe it has too many 
neutrons or too few protons. 
The tungsten- 186 nuclei begin 
to emit electrons and with each 



emitted electron a neutron 
changes to a proton until, in 
the end, it is plutonium- 186 
again. With each tungsten-186 
nucleus sent into the para- 
Universe, twenty more elec- 
trons are added to it. 

The plutonium/tungsten can 
make its cycle endlessly back 
and forth between Universe 
and para-Universe, yield- 
ing energy first in one and then 
in another, the net effect being 
a transfer of twenty electrons 
from our Universe to theirs per 
each nucleus cycled. Both 
sides can gain energy from 
what is, in effect, an Inter- 
Universe Electron Pump. 

The conversion of this notion 
into reality and the actual establish- 
ment of the Electron Pump as an 
effective energy source proceeded 
with amazing speed and every stage 
of its success enhanced Hallam’s 
prestige.

I AMONT had no reason to doubt 
j the basis of that prestige and 
it was with a certain hero worship 
(the memory of which quite em- 
barrassed him later and which he 
strove — with some success — to 
eliminate from his mind) that he 
first applied for a chance to inter- 
view Hallam at some length in 
connection with the history he was 
planning. 



GALAXY 




Hallam seemed amenable. In 
thirty years his position in public 
esteem had become so lofty one 
might wonder why his nose did not 
bleed. Physically he had aged im- 
pressively, if not gracefully. There 
was a ponderousness to his body 
that gave him the appearance of 
circumstantial weightiness and if 
his face were gross in its features 
he seemed able to give them the air 
of a kind of intellectual repose. He 
still reddened readily and the easily 
bruised nature of his self-esteem 
was a byword. 

Hallam had undergone some 
quick briefing before Lamont’s 
entrance. He said, “You are Dr. 
Peter Lamont and you’ve done 
good work. I’m told, on para- 
theory. I recall your paper. On 
para-fusion, wasn’t it?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

“Well, refresh my memory. Tell 
me about it. Informally, of course, 
as though you were talking to a 
layman. After all — ” he chuckled 
here — “in a way I’m a layman. 
I’m just a radiochemist, you know 
— and no great theoretician unless 
you want to count a few concepts 
now and then.” 

Lamont accepted this at the time 
as a straightforward statement 
and, indeed, the speech may not 
have been as obscenely conde- 
scending as he later insisted on 
remembering it to have been. It 
was typical though — as Lamont 
later found out or at least main- 
tained — of Hallam’s method of 



grasping the essentials of the work 
done by others. He could talk 
briskly about the subject there- 
after without being overly partic- 
ular, or particular at all, about as- 
signing credit. 

But the younger Lamont of the 
time was rather flattered. He 
plunged ahead at once with that 
voluble eagerness one experiences 
when one is explaining one’s own 
discoveries. “I can’t say I did 
much. Dr. Hallam. Deducing the 
laws of nature of the para-Universe 
— the para-laws — is a tricky busi- 
ness. We don’t have much to go on. 
I started from what little we know 
and assumed no new departures 
that we had no evidence for. It 
seems obvious that with a stronger 
nuclear interaction, the fusion of 
small nuclei would take place more 
readily.” 

“Para-fusion,” said Hallam. 

“Yes, sir. The trick was simply 
to work out what the details might 
be. The mathematics involved was 
somewhat subtle but once a few 
transformations were made, the 
difficulties tended to melt away. It 
turns out, for instance, that lithium 
hydride can be made to undergo 
catastrophic fusion at temperatures 
four orders of magnitude lower 
there than here. It takes fission- 
bomb temperatures to explode 
lithium hydride here, but a mere 
dynamite charge, so to speak, 
would turn the trick in the para- 
Universe. Just possibly lithium 
hydride in the para-Universe could 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



21 




be ignited with a match, but that’s 
not very likely. We’ve offered them 
lithium hydride, you know, since 
fusion power might be natural for 
them, but they won’t touch it.” 
“Yes, I know that.” 

“It would clearly be too risky for 
them — like using nitroglycerin in 
ton lots in rocket engines — only 
worse.” 

“Very good. And you are also 
writing a history of the Pump?” 
“An informal one, sir. When the 
manuscript is ready 1 will ask you 
to read it, if I may, so that I might 
have the benefit of your intimate 
knowledge of events. In fact, 1 
would like to take advantage of 
some of that knowledge right now 
if you have a little time.” 

“I can make some. What is it 
you want to know?” Hallam was 
smiling. It was the last time he ever 
smiled in Lamont’s presence. 

“The development of an effective 
and practical Pump, Professor Hal- 
lam, took place with extraordinary 
speed,” began Lamont. “Once the 
Pump Project — ” 

“The Inter-Universe Electron 
Pump Project,” corrected Hallam, 
still smiling. 

“Yes, of course,” said Lamont, 
clearing his throat. “I was merely 
using the popular name. Once the 
project started, the engineering 
details were developed with great 
rapidity and with little waste 
motion.” 

“That is true,” said Hallam, 
with a touch of complacence. 



“People have tried to tell me that 
the credit was mine for vigorous 
and imaginative direction, but I 
wouldn’t care to have you over- 
stress that in your book. The fact 
is that we had an enormous fund 
of talent in the project, and I 
wouldn’t want the brilliance of 
individual members to be dimmed 
by any exaggeration of my role.” 
Lamont shook his head with a 
little annoyance. He found the re- 
mark irrelevant. He said, “I don’t 
mean that at all. I mean the in- 
telligence at the other end — the 
para-men, to use the popular 
phrase. They started it. We dis- 
covered them after the first trans- 
fer of plutonium for tungsten — 
but they discovered us first in order 
to make the transfer, working on 
pure theory and without the bene- 
fit of the kind of hint they gave 
us. And there’s the iron foil they 
sent across — ” 

Hallam’s smile had now disap- 
peared — and permanently. He was 
frowning as he said loudly, “The 
symbols were never understood. 
Nothing about them — ” 

“The geometric figures were un- 
derstood, sir. I’ve looked into it, 
and it is quite clear that they were 
directing the geometry of the Pump. 
It seems to me that — ” 

Hallam’s chair moved back with 
an angry scrape. He said, “Let’s 
not have any of that, young man. 
We did the work, not they.” 

“Yes — but isn’t it true that 
they — ” 



22 



GALAXY 




“That they what?” 

Lament became aware now of 
the storm of emotion he had raised, 
but he could not understand its 
cause. Uncertainly he said, “That 
they are more intelligent than we — 
that they did the real work? Is there 
any doubt of that, sir?” 

Hallam, red-faced, had heaved 
himself to his feet. “There is every 
doubt,” he shouted. “1 will not 
have mysticism here. There is too 
much of that. See here, young man 
— ” he advanced on the still seated 
and thoroughly astonished Lamont 
and shook a thick finger at him — 
“if your history is going to take the 
attitude that we were puppets in the 
hands of the para-men it will not 
be published from this institution — 
or at all — if I have my way. I will 
not have mankind and its intel- 
ligence downgraded and I won’t 
have para-men cast in the role of 
gods.” 

Lamont had no choice but to 



leave, a puzzled man, utterly up- 
set at having created harsh feeling 
where he had wanted to sow only 
good will. 

And then he found that his his- 
torical sources were suddenly dry- 
ing up. Those who had been 
loquacious enough a week earlier 
now remembered nothing and had 
no time for further interviews. 

Lamont was irritated at first. 
Then a slow anger began to build 
within him. He looked at what he 
had from a new viewpoint, and now 
he began to squeeze and insist 
where earlier he had merely asked. 
When he met Hallam at depart- 
ment functions Hallam frowned 
and looked through him, and La- 
mont began to look scornful in his 
turn. 

The net result was that Lamont 
found his prime career as para- 
theoretician beginning to abort 
and he turned more firmly than ever 
toward his history.

<<^"|T*HAT damned fool,” muttered Lamont reminiscently. “You 
A had to be there, Mike, to see him go into panic at any sug- 
gestion that it was the other side that was the moving force. I look 
back on it and I wonder — how was it possible to meet him, however 
casually, and not know he would react that way. Just be grateful 
you never had to work with him.” 

“I am,” said Bronowski, indifferently, “though there are times 
when you’re no angel.” 

“Don’t complain. With your sort of work you have no problems.” 
“Also no interest. Who cares about my sort of work except myself 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

and five others in the world. Maybe six others — if you remember.” 
Lamont remembered. “Oh, well,” he said.

B RONOWSKI’S placid exterior 
never fooled anyone who grew 
to know him even moderately well. 
He was sharp and he worried a 
problem until he had the solution 
or until he had it in such tatters 
that he knew no solution was 
possible. 

Consider the Etruscan inscrip- 
tions on which he had built his 
reputation. The tongue had been 
a living one until the first century 
A.D., but the cultural imperialism 
of the Romans had left nothing 
behind, so the language had van- 
ished completely. What inscriptions 
survived the carnage of Roman 
hostility and — worse, indifference 
— had been written in Greek letters 
and could be pronounced, but 
nothing more. The language seem- 
ed to have no relationship to any 
of the surrounding ones, seemed 
archaic and not even Indo- 
European. 

Bronowski noted that another 
language existed that seemed to 
have no relationship to any of the 
surrounding languages, that seemed 
quite archaic and not even Indo- 
European — but one very much 
alive and spoken in a region not 
far from where once the Etruscans 
had lived. 



What of the Basque language? 
Bronowski wondered. And he used 
Basque as his guide. 

So much for inspiration. The 
rest was hard work, for Basque, 
an extraordinarily difficult lan- 
guage in itself, was only the loosest 
of helps. Bronowski found more 
and more reason, as he went on, 
to suspect some cultural connec- 
tion between the inhabitants of 
early northern Italy and early 
northern Spain. He could even 
make out a strong case for a broad 
swatch of pre-Celts filling western 
Europe with a language of which 
Etruscan and Basque were dimly 
related survivors. In two thousand 
years, however, Basque had 
evolved and had become more than 
a little contaminated with Spanish. 
To try first to reason out its struc- 
ture in Roman times and then re- 
late it to Etruscan was an intel- 
lectual feat of surpassing difficulty 
and Bronowski utterly astonished 
the world’s philologists when he 
triumphed. 

The Etruscan translations them- 
selves were marvels of dullness and 
had no significance whatever. They 
were routine funerary inscriptions 
for the most part. The fact of the 
translation, however, was stunning 
and, as it turned out, it proved of 
the greatest importance to Lamont 

Not at first. To be perfectly 



24 



GALAXY 




truthful about the matter, the 
translations had been a fact for 
nearly five years before Lamont 
had as much as heard that there 
once were such people as the Etrus- 
cans. But then Bronowski came to 
the University to give one of the 
annual Fellowship Lectures and 
Lamont, who usually shirked the 
duty of attending that fell on the 
faculty members, did not shirk it 
this time. 

He heard the lecture, not because 
he recognized its importance or felt 
any interest in it whatever, but 
because he was dating a graduate 
student in the Department of 
Romance Languages and his 
choices were listening to Bronowski 
or going to a music festival he 
particularly wanted to avoid. 

The social connection was a 
feeble one, scarcely satisfactory 
from Lamont’s point of view and 
only temporary, but it did get him 
to the talk. 

He rather enjoyed it, as it hap- 
pened. The dim Etruscan civiliza- 
tion entered his consciousness for 
the first time as a matter of distant 
interest and the problem of solving 
an undeciphered language struck 
him as fascinating. When young, 
he had enjoyed solving crypto- 
grams, but had put them away with 
other childish things in favor of 
the much grander cryptograms 
posed by nature, so that he ended 
in para-theory. 

Yet Bronowski’s talk took him 
back to the youthful joys of making 



slow sense of what seemed a ran- 
dom collection of symbols, com- 
bined with sufficient difficulty to 
add great honor to the task. 
Bronowski was a cryptogrammatist 
on the grandest scale, and it was the 
description of the steady encroach- 
ment of reason upon the unknown 
that Lamont enjoyed. 

All would yet have gone for 
nothing — the triple coincidence of 
Bronowski’s appearance on cam- 
pus, Lamont’s youthful crypto- 
grammic enthusiasm, the social 
pressure of an attractive young 
lady — were it not for the fact that 
Lamont saw Hallam the following 
day and placed himself firmly and, 
as he eventually found, perma- 
nently, in the doghouse. 

Within an hour of the conclusion 
of that interview, Lamont deter- 
mined to see Bronowski. The issue 
at hand was the very one that had 
seemed so obvious to himself and 
that had so offended Hallam. Be- 
cause it brought down censure on 
him, Lamont felt bound to strike 
back — and in connection with the 
point of censure specifically. The 
para-men were more intelligent 
than man. Lamont had believed it 
before in a casual sort of way as 
something more obvious than vital. 
Now it had become vital. It must 
be proved and the fact of it forced 
down the throat of Hallam — side- 
ways, if possible, and with all the 
sharp corners exposed. 

Already Lamont found himself 
so far removed from his so-recent 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



25 




hero worship that he relished the 
prospect. 

RONOWSKI was still on 
campus. Lamont tracked him 
down and insisted on seeing him. 

Bronowski was blandly courte- 
ous when finally cornered. 

Lamont acknowledged the 
courtesies brusquely, introduced 
hirnself with clear impatience and 
said, “Dr. Bronowski, I’m de- 
lighted to have caught you before 
you left. I hope that I will persuade 
you to stay here even longer.’’ 
Bronowski said, “That may not 
be hard. I have been offered a posi- 
tion on the University faculty.’’ 
“And you will accept the posi- 
tion?” 

“I am considering it. I think I 
may.” 

“You must. You will, when you 
hear what I have to say. Dr. 
Bronowski, what is there for you 
to do now that you’ve solved the 
Etruscan inscriptions?” 

“That is not my only task, young 
man.” (He was five years older 
than Lamont.) “I’m an archeolo- 
gist and there is more to Etruscan 
culture than its inscriptions and 
more to pre-classical Italic culture 
than the Etruscans.” 

“But surely nothing as exciting 
for you — and as challenging — as 
the Etruscan inscriptions?” 

“I grant you that.” 

“So you would welcome some- 
thing even more exciting, even 
more challenging — and something 



a trillion times as significant as 
those inscriptions.” 

“What have you in mind. Dr. — 
Lamont?” 

“We have inscriptions that are 
not part of a dead culture or part 
of anything on Earth — or part of 
anything in the Universe. We have 
something called para-symbols.” 
“I’ve heard of them. For that 
matter, I’ve seen them.” 

“Surely, then, you have had the 
urge to tackle the problem. Dr. 
Bronowski? You have had the 
desire to work out what they say?” 
“No desire at all. Dr. Lamont, 
because there’s no problem.” 
Lamont stared at him sus- 
piciously, “You mean you can 
read them?” 

Bronowski shook his head. “You 
mistake me. I mean I can’t possibly 
read them, nor can anyone else. 
There’s no base. In the case of 
Earthly languages, however dead, 
there is always the chance of find- 
ing a living language — or a dead 
language already deciphered — that 
bears some relationship to it, how- 
ever faint. Failing that, there is at 
least the fact that any Earthly 
language was written by human 
beings with human ways of 
thought. That makes a starting 
point, however feeble. None of 
this is the case with the para- 
symbols — so that they constitute 
a problem that clearly has no 
solution. An insolubility is not a 
problem.” 

Lamont had kept himself from 




26 



GALAXY 




interrupting only with difficulty. 
Now he burst out with: “You are 
wrong, Dr. Bronowski. I don’t 
want to seem to be teaching you 
your profession but you don’t know 
some of the facts that my own 
profession has uncovered. We are 
dealing with para-men concerning 
whom we know hardly anything. 
We don’t know what they are like, 
how they think, what kind of world 
they live on — we have data on 
almost nothing, however basic and 
fundamental. So far you are right.’’ 
“Blit it’s only almost nothing 
that you know, is that it?’’ Bronow- 
ski did not seem impressed. He 
took a package of dried figs from 
his pocket, opened it and began 
to eat. He profferred it to Lamont, 
who shook his head. 

Lamont said, “Right. We do 
know one thing of crucial impor- 
tance. They are more intelligent 
than we are. Item one: they can 
make the exchange across the 
inter-Universe gap, while we can 
play only a passive role.’’ He 
interrupted himself here to ask, 
“Do you know anything about the 
Inter-Universe Electron Pump?’’ 
“A little,’’ said Bronowski. 
“Enough to follow you. Doctor, 
if you don’t get technical.’’ 

Lamont hastened on. “Item two: 
They sent us instructions as to how 
to set up our part of the pump. 
We couldn’t understand the device 
but we could make out the 
diagrams sufficiently well to give 
us the necessary hints. Item Three: 



They can somehow sense us. At 
least they can become aware of 
our leaving tungsten for them to 
pick up, for instance. They know 
where it is and can act upon it. 
We can do nothing comparable. 
There are other points but these 
are enough to show the para-men 
to be clearly more intelligent than 
we are.” 

Bronowski said, “I imagine, 
though, that you are in the 
minority here. Surely your 
colleagues don’t accept this.” 

“They don’t. But what makes 
you come to that conclusion?” 
“Because you’re clearly wrong, 
it seems to me.” 

“My facts are correct. And since 
they are, how can I be wrong?” 
“You are merely proving that 
the technology of the para-men is 
more advanced than ours. What 
has technology to do with intelli- 
gence? See here — ” 

B ronowski rose to take off 
his jacket and then sat down 
in a half-reclining position, the soft 
rotundity of his body seeming to 
relax and crease in great comfort 
as though physical ease helped him 
think. 

“About two and a half centuries 
ago the American naval com- 
mander, Matthew Perry, led a 
flotilla into Tokyo harbor. The 
Japanese, until then isolated, found 
themselves faced with a technology 
considerably beyond their own and 
decided it was unwise to risk 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



27 




resistance. An entire warlike 
nation of millions was helpless in 
the face of a few ships from across 
the sea. Did that prove that Amer- 
icans were more intelligent than 
the Japanese — or merely that 
Western culture had taken a 
different turning? Clearly the 
latter, for within half a century 
the Japanese had successfully 
imitated Western technology and 
within another half-century they 
were a major industrial power 
despite the fact that they were 
disastrously beaten in one of the 
wars of the time.” 

Lamont listened gravely and said, 
“I’ve thought of your point, too. 
Dr. Bronowski, though I didn’t 
know about the Japanese — I wish 
I had the time to read history. 
Yet the analogy is wrong. The 
para-men’s is more than technical 
superiority — it’s a matter of 
difference in degree of intelligence.” 

“How can you tell, aside from 
guessing?” 

“Because of the mere fact that 
they sent us directions. They were 
eager for us to set up our part of 
the Pump — they had to have us do 
it. They could not physically cross 
over — ” 

He paused for breath, feeling 
himself to be too excited, too 
eager. He mustn’t oversell his 
case. 

Bronowski regarded him curi- 
ously. “All right, they sent us mes- 
sages. What are you trying to de- 
duce from that?” 



“That they expected us to under- 
stand. Could they be such fools 
as to send us rather intricate 
messages, in some cases quite 
lengthy, if they knew we would not 
understand? Except for their 
diagrams we would have ended 
nowhere. Now if they expected 
us to understand, it could only be 
because they felt that any creatures 
like ourselves with a technology 
roughly as advanced as their own 
(and they must have been able to 
estimate that somehow — another 
point in favor of my belief) must 
also be roughly as intelligent as 
they are and would experience little 
difficulty in working out something 
from their symbols.” 

“They might also be reasoning 
from naivete,” said Bronowski, 
unimpressed. 

“You mean they think there is 
only one language, spoken and 
written — and that another intelli- 
gence in another Universe speaks 
and writes as they do? Come on!” 

Bronowski said, “Even if 1 were 
to grant your point, what do you 
want me to do? I’ve looked at the 
para-symbols — 1 suppose every 
archeologist and philologist on 
Earth has. 1 don’t see what I can 
do and neither. I’m sure, does 
anyone else. No progress has been 
made in over twenty years.” 

Lamont said intensely, “What’s 
true is that in twenty years there 
has been no desire for progress. 
The Pump Authority does not want 
to solve the symbols.” 



28 



GALAXY 




“Why shouldn’t it want to?’’ 
“Because of the annoying 
possibility that communication 
with the para-men will demon- 
strate them to be distinctly more 
intelligent than we are. Because 
human beings might be shown to 
be the puppet-partners in connect- 
tion with the Pump to the hurt of 
their ego. And, specifically — ’’ 
Lament strove to keep venom out 
of his voice — “because Hallam 
would lose the credit of being the 
Father of the Electron Pump.’’ 
“Suppose the Authority did want 
to make progress. What could be 
done? The will is not the deed, you 
know.’’ 

“It could get the para-men to 
cooperate. It could send messages 
to the para-Universe. This has 
never been done, but such attempts 
would be feasible. A message on 
metal foil might be placed under a 
pellet of tungsten.” 

“Oh? Are they still looking for 
other tungsten, even with the 
Pumps in operation?” 

“No.” Lamont frowned. With 
the Pumps in full operation enough 
energy was apparently being deliv- 
ered in the para-Universe to meet 
all requirements. Then he shrugged. 
“No — but I think we can assume 
that they’re curious. If we borrow 
one of the small experimental 
Pump field generators and put a 
pellet of tungsten in that with a 
message — it should attract their 
attention. If they take the message 
and make any sense of it, even the 



slightest, they’ll send back one of 
their own. They might set up an 
equivalence table of their words 
and ours or they might use a 
mixture of their words and ours. 
It will be a kind of alternate push, 
first their side, then ours, then 
theirs again— and so on.” 

“With their side,” said Bronow- 
ski, “doing most of the work.” 
“Yes.” 

Bronowski shook his head. “No 
fun in that, is there? It doesn’t 
appeal to me.” 

Lamont flared, “Not enough in 
it for you? What did you get out 
of the Etruscan inscriptions, damn 
it? You beat out five others in the 
world. Maybe six. With them 
you’re a success and they hate 
you. What else? You go about 
lecturing on the subject before 
audiences amounting to a few 
dozen and they forget your name 
the day after. Is that what you’re 
really after?” 

“Don’t be dramatic.” 

“All right. I won’t be. I’ll get 
someone else. It may take longer 
but, as you say, the para-men will 
do most of the work anyway. If 
necessary. I’ll do it myself.” 

“Have you been assigned this 
project?” 

“No, I haven’t. What of it? Or is 
that another reason you don’t want 
to get involved? Disciplinary 
problems? There is no law against 
attempting translation and I can 
always place tungsten on my desk. 

I will not choose to report any 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



29 




messages I get in place of the 
tungsten and to that extent I will 
be breaking the research code. 
Once the translation is made, who 
will complain? Would you work 
with me if I guaranteed your safety 
and kept your part in it secret. 
You would lose your fame but you 
may value your security more. 
Oh, well — ” Lamont shrugged. 
“If I do it myself I’ll have the 
advantage of not having to worry 
about someone else’s security.” 

He rose to go. Both men were 
angry and bore themselves with 
that stiff-legged courtesy one 
assumes when addressing someone 
who is hostile but still mannerly. 

“I presume,” said Lamont, “you 
will at least treat this conversation 
as confidential.” 

Bronowski was on his feet, too. 
“Of that you may be assured,” 
he said coldly and the two shook 
hands briefly. 

I AMONT did not expect to hear 
4 from Bronowski again. He even 
began the process of talking him- 
self into believing it would be better 
for him to handle the translation 
effort on his own. 

Two days later, however, Bron- 
owski was at Lamont’s laboratory. 
He said rather brusquely, “I’m 
leaving the city now, but I’ll be 
back in September. I’m taking the 
position here and, if you’re still 
interested. I’ll see what I can do 
about the translation problem 
you mentioned.” 



Lamont had barely time for a 
surprised expression of thanks 
before Bronowski stalked off, 
apparently angrier at having given 
in than at having resisted. 

They became friends in time — 
and in time Lamont learned what 
had brought Bronowski around. 
The day after their discussion, 
Bronowski had had lunch at the 
Faculty Club with a group of the 
higher officials of the University, 
including, of course, the president. 
Bronowski had announced that he 
would accept the position and send 
in a formal letter to that effect 
in due time and all had expressed 
gratification. 

The president had said, “It will 
be quite a feather in our cap to have 
the renowned translator of the 
Itascan Inscriptions here at the 
University. We are honored.” 

The malapropism had gone un- 
corrected, of course, and Bronow- 
ski’s smile, though strained, did 
not actually waver. Afterward 
the head of the Department of 
Ancient History explained the 
president to be more of a Min- 
nesotan than a Classical scholar 
and since Lake Itasca was the 
point of origin of the mighty 
Mississippi, the slip of the tongue 
had been a natural one. 

But in combination with La- 
mont’s sneer at the extent of his 
fame Bronowski found the expres- 
sion rankling. 

When Lamont finally heard the 
story he was amused. “Don’t go 



30 



GALAXY 




on,” he said. “I’ve been down that 
road, too. You said to yourself, 
‘By God, I’ll do something even 
that knot-head will have to get 
straight.’ ” 

“A little like that,” said 
Bronowski. 

5 

A YEAR’S work, however, had 
. netted them very little. 
Messages had finally gone across 
to the para-men — messages had 
come back. Nothing of conse- 
quence had been revealed. 

“Just make a guess!” Lamont 
had said feverishly to Bronowski. 
“Any wild guess at all. Try it out 
on them.” 

“It’s exactly what I’m doing, 
Pete. What are you so jumpy 
about? I spent twelve years on the 
Etruscan Inscriptions. Do you 
expect this job to take any less 
time?” 

“Good God, Mike. We can’t 
take twelve years.” 

“Why not? Look, Pete, it hasn’t 
escaped me that there’s been a 
change in your attitude. You’ve 
been impossible this last month 
or so. I thought we had it clear 
at the start that this work can’t 
go quickly and that we’ve got to 
be patient. I thought you under- 
stood that I had my regular duties 
at the University, too. Look, I’ve 
asked you this a number of times 
now. Let me ask again. Why are 
you in such a hurry?” 

THE GODS THEMSELVES 



“Because I’m in a hurry,” said 
Lamont abruptly. “Because I want 
to get on with it.” 

“Congratulations,” said Bron- 
owski dryly. “So do I. Listen, 
you’re not expecting an early 
death, are you? Your doctor hasn’t 
told you you’re hiding a fatal 
cancer?” 

“No, no,” groaned Lamont. 

“Well, then?” 

“Never mind,” said Lamont. 
He walked away hurriedly. 

When he had first tried to get 
Bronowski to join forces with him. 
Lament’s grievance had concerned 
only Hallam’s mean-minded 
obstinacy concerning the sugges- 
tion that the para-men were the 
more intelligent. It was in that 
respect and that respect only that 
Lamont had been striving for a 
breakthrough. He had intended 
nothing beyond that — at first. 

But in the course of the following 
months he had been subjected 
to endless exasperation. His re- 
quests for equipment, for technical 
assistance, for computer time 
were delayed. His request for travel 
funds was snubbed. His views at 
interdepartmental meetings were 
invariably overlooked. 

The breaking point came when 
Henry Garrison, junior to himself 
in point of service and definitely 
so in point of ability, received an 
advisory appointment, rich in 
prestige, that by all rights should 
have gone to Lamont. It was then 
that Lamont’s resentment built 

31 




up to the point where merely 
proving himself right was no longer 
sufficient. He yearned to smash 
Hallam, destroy him utterly. 

The feeling was reinforced every 
day, every hour, by the unmistak- 
able attitude of everyone else at the 
Pump Station. Lamont’s abrasive 
personality did not collect sympa- 
thy, but some gave it to him 
nevertheless. 

G arrison himself was em- 
barrassed. He was a quiet- 
spoken, amiable young man who 
clearly wanted no trouble and who 
now stood in the doorway of 
Lamont’s lab with an expression 
that had more than a small 
component of apprehension in it. 

He said, “Hey, Pete, can I have 
a few words with you?” 

“As many as you like,” said 
Lamont, frowning and avoiding 
a direct eye-to-eye glance. 

Garrison came in and sat down. 
“Pete,” he said, ‘I can’t turn 
down the appointment but I want 
you to know I didn’t push for it. 
It came as a surprise.” 

“Who’s asking you to turn it 
down? I don’t give a damn.” 

“Pete. It’s Hallam. If I turned it 
down it would go to someone else, 
not you. What have you done to the 
old man?” 

Lamont rounded on the other. 
“What do you think of Hallam? 
What kind of man is he, in your 
opinion?” 

Garrison was caught by surprise. 



He pursed his lips and rubbed his 
nose. “Well — ” He let the sound 
fade off. 

“Great man? Brilliant scientist? 
Inspiring leader?” 

“Well—” 

“Let me tell you. The man’s a 
phony. He’s a fraud. He’s got this 
reputation and this position of his 
and he’s sitting there in a panic. 
He knows that I see through him 
and that’s what he has against me.” 
Garrison gave a small, uneasy 
laugh, “You haven’t gone up to 
him and said — ” 

“No, I haven’t said anything 
directly to him,” said Lamont 
morosely. “Some day I will. And 
he can tell. He knows I’m one 
person he isn’t fooling even if I 
don’t say anything.” 

“But Pete, where’s the point in 
letting him know it? I don’t say I 
think he’s the world’s greatest 
either, but where’s the sense in 
broadcasting it? Butter him up a 
little. He’s got your career in his 
hands.” 

“Has he? I’ve got his reputation 
in mine. I’m going to show him up. 
I’m going to strip him.” 

“How?” 

“That’s my business,” muttered 
Lamont, who at the moment had 
not the slightest idea of how. 

“But that’s ridiculous,” said 
Garrison. “You can’t win. He’ll 
just destroy you. Even if he isn’t an 
Einstein or an Oppenheimer, he’s 
more than either to the world in 
general. He is the Father of the 



32 



GALAXY 




Electron Pump to Earth’s two- 
billion population and nothing you 
can possibly do will affect them as 
long as the Electron Pump is the 
key to human paradise. While 
that’s so Hallam can’t be touched 
and you’re crazy if you think he 
can. What the hell, Pete? Tell him 
he’s great and eat crow. Don’t be 
another Denison!” 

“1 tell you what, Henry,” said 
Lamont in sudden fury. “Why not 
mind your own business?” 

Garrison rose suddenly and left 
without a word. Lamont had made 
another enemy — or at least lost 
another friend. The price, however, 
was right, he finally decided, for 
one remark of Garrison’s had set 
the ball rolling in another direction. 

Garrison had said, . as long as 
the Electron Pump is the key to 
human paradise . Hallam can't 
be touched. 

With that clanging in his mind 
Lamont, for the first time, turned 
his attention away from Hallam 
and placed it on the Electron 
Pump. Was the Electron Pump the 
key to human paradise? Or was 
there, by heaven, a catch? 

Every blessing in human history 
had had a catch. What was the 
catch to the Electron Pump? 

The Pump supplied unlimited 
amounts of almost free power, 
with no chemical or radioactive 
wastes. It had made possible the 
cleaning of pollution from the air 
and the water and the realization of 
most of mankind’s dreams that had 



once been economically unfeasible. 
Now it promised apparently unend- 
ing prosperity. 

P iROPERLY speaking, of 

course, it was not an Electron 
Pump. It did not Pump electrons, 
but rather a continuous stream of 
tungsten- 186 atoms in exchange 
for the equivalent plutonium- 186. 
But since the net effect was to 
transfer electrons from the 
Universe to the para-Universe, 
even most scientists tended to 
overlook the intermediate steps. 

Lamont knew enough of the 
history of para-theory to know that 
the matter of “a catch” had not 
gone unexplored. When it was 
first announced that the basic 
overall effect of the Electron Pump 
was the Pumping of electrons from 
the Universe to the para-Universe, 
there had not been wanting those 
who asked immediately, “But 
what will happen when all the 
electrons have been Pumped?” 
This was easily answered. At the 
largest reasonable rate of Pumping 
the electron supply would last for 
at least a trillion trillion trillion 
years — and the entire Universe, 
together, presumably, with the 
para-Universe, would not last a tiny 
fraction of that time. 

The next objection seemed more 
sophisticated. All right, there was 
no possibility of Pumping away all 
the electrons. But as they were 
Pumped the para-Universe would 
gain a net negative charge to repel 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

others being Pumped, while the 
Universe would gain a net positive 
charge to hold the electrons more 
firmly here. What happened when 
it took more energy to operate the 
Pump than could be produced by 
it? 

The para-theorists should have 
disposed of that quickly. The atoms 
actually being pumped had a 
balance of charges to make them 
neutral. Neutral substances should 
not be affected by the charge of the 
Universe. 

But it seemed there was a Law of 
Conservation of the Cussedness of 
Things. It had already been 
discovered that the Pump would 
not work to transfer any substance 
that was ionized. The increase of a 
positive charge in the Universe, it 
was realized, would ionize the 
neutral atoms by stripping away 
some of the loosely held orbital 
electrons around them. Careful 
mathematical analysis indicated 
that the effort of Pumping would 
increase at precisely the same rate 
as if it had been electrons that were 
Pumped. 

Apparently it did not matter 
whether the process was considered 
incorrectly as Pumping electrons 
or treated with full scientific rigor. 
The results were the same. With 
each year, as the difference in 
charge grew, it would become more 
difficult to Pump further atoms 
(or electrons) against the force 
of the resisting charge-difference. 

If the charge concentration re- 



mained at the points of Pumping, 
the effect would stop almost at 
once but, of course, it didn’t. The 
concentration diffused outward 
over the Earth and the effect had 
been calculated with that in mind. 

The increased positive charge of 
the Earth generally forced the 
positively charged solar wind to 
avoid the planet at a greater dis- 
tance and the magnetosphere was 
enlarged. Thanks to the work of 
McFarland (the real originator of 
the Great Insight according to 
Lamont) it could be shown that a 
definite equilibrium point was 
reached as the solar wind swept 
away more and more of the ac- 
cumulating positive particles that 
were repelled from Earth’s sur- 
face and driven higher into the 
exosphere. With each increase in 
Pumping intensity — with each 
additional Pumping Station con- 
structed — the net positive charge 
on Earth increased slightly and the 
magnetosphere expanded by a few 
miles. The change, however, was 
minor and the positive charge was, 
in the end, swept away by the solar 
wind and spread through the outer 
reaches of the solar system. 

Even so — even allowing for the 
most rapid possible diffusion of 
the charge, the time would still 
come when the local charge- 
difference between Universe and 
para-Universe at the points of 
Pumping would grow large enough 
to end the process. That would be 
a small fraction of the time it 



34 - 



GALAXY 




would take really to use up all 
the electrons — roughly, a trillion- 
trillionth of the time. 

But that still meant that Pumping 
would remain possible for a 
trillion years. Only a single trillion 
years, but that was enough — it 
would suffice. A trillion years was 
far longer than man or the solar 
system would last. And if man 
somehow did last that long (or 
some creature that was man’s 
successor and supplanter) then no 
doubt something would be devised 
to correct the situation. A great 
deal could be done in a trillion 
years. 

Lamont had to agree to that. 

B ut then he remembered some- 
thing else, a line of thought 
Hallam himself had dealt with in 
one of the articles he had written 
for popular consumption. With 
some' distaste, he dug out the arti- 
cle. It was important to see what 
Hallam had said, before he car- 
ried the matter further. 

The article said in part: 

Because of the ever-present 
gravitational force, we have 
come to associate the expres- 
sion ‘downhill’ with the kind of 
inevitable change we can use 
to produce energy we can con- 
vert into useful work. It is the 
water running downhill that, 
in past centuries, turned wheels 
that in turn powered machinery 
such as pumps and generators. 



But what happens when all 
the water has run downhill? 

No further work can then be 
possible until the water has 
been returned uphill — and 
that takes work. In fact, it 
takes more work to force the 
water uphill than we can col- 
lect by allowing it to flow 
downhill. We work at an 
energy loss. Fortunately the 
sun does the work for us. It 
evaporates the oceans so that 
water vapor climbs high in 
the atmosphere, forms clouds 
and eventually falls again as 
rain or snow. This soaks the 
ground at all levels, fills the 
springs and streams and keeps 
the water forever running 
downhill. 

But not quite forever. The 
sun can raise the water vapor, 
but only because, in a nuclear 
sense, it is running downhill, 
too. It is running downhill at 
a rate immensely greater than 
any Earthly river can manage 
— and when all of it has run 
downhill there will be nothing 
we know of to pull it uphill 
again. 

All sources of energy in our 
Universe run down. We cannot 
help that. Everything is 
downhill in just one direction 
and we can force a temporary 
uphill course only by taking 
advantage of some greater 
downhill in the vicinity. If we 
want useful energy forever 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



35 




we need a road that goes 
downhill both ways. That is 
a paradox in our Universe — it 
stands to reason that whatever 
is downhill one way is uphill 
going back. 

But need we confine our- 
selves to our Universe alone? 
Think of the para-Universe. 
It has roads, too, that are 
downhill in one direction and 
uphill in the other. Those 
roads, however, don’t fit in 
with our roads. It is possible 
to take a road from the para- 
Universe to our Universe that 
runs downhill and which, when 
we follow it back from the 
Universe to the para-Universe 
runs downhill again — because 
the two Universes have dif- 
ferent laws of behavior. 

The Electron Pump takes 
advantage of a road that is 
downhill both ways. The 
Electron Pump . 

Lamont looked at the title of the 
piece again. It was: The Road 
That Runs Downhill Both JVays. 

He began to think. The concept 
was, of course, a familiar one to 
him, as were its thermodynamic 
consequences. But why not examine 
the assumptions? That had to be 
the weak point in any theory. 
What if the assumptions, assumed 
to be right by definition, were 
wrong? What would be the conse- 
quences if one started with other 
assumptions? Contradictory ones? 



He started blindly but within a 
month he had that feeling that 
every scientist recognizes — the 
endless clicking of unexpected 
pieces of the puzzle falling into 
place as annoying anomalies 
become anomalous no more. 

It was the feel of Truth. 

From that moment on he began 
to put additional pressure on 
Bronowski. 

And one day he said, “I’m going 
to see Hallam again.” 

Bronowski’s eyebrows lifted. 
“What for?” 

“To have him turn me down.” 

“Yes, that’s about your speed, 
Pete. You’re unhappy if your 
troubles die down a bit.” 

“You don’t understand. It’s 
important to have him refuse to 
listen to me. I can’t have it said 
afterward that I bypassed him — 
that he was ignorant of what I was 
doing.” 

“That would make him ignorant 
of what? Of the translation of the 
para-symbols? We don’t have a 
translation as yet. Don’t jump the 
gun, Pete.” 

“No, no, not that.” And Lamont 
would say no more. 

H allam did not make it 
easy for Lamont. Some 
weeks passed before he could find 
time to see the younger man. Nor 
did Lamont intend to make it easy 
for Hallam. He stalked in with 
every invisible bristle on edge and 
sharply pointed. Hallam waited for 



36 



GALAXY 




him frozen-faced, with sullen eyes. 

Hallam asked abruptly, “What’s 
this crisis you’re talking about?’’ 
“Something’s turned up, sir,’’ 
said Lamont tonelessly, “inspired 
by one of your articles.’’ 

“Oh?” Then, quickly: “Which 
one?” 

“The Road That Runs Downhill 
Both Ways. The one you pro- 
gramed for Teenage Life, sir.” 
“And what about it?” 

“I believe the Electron Pump 
is not downhill both ways, if I may 
use your metaphor which is not, as 
it happens, a completely accurate 
way of describing the Second Law 
of Thermodynamics.” 

Hallam frowned. “What have 
you got in mind?” 

“I can explain it best, sir, by set- 
ting up the Field Equations for the 
two Universes, sir, and demonstrat- 
ing an interaction that until now 
has not been considered — un- 
fortunately so, in my opinion.” 
With that Lamont moved 
directly to the thixo-board and 
quickly fingered the equations, 
talking rapidly as he did so. 

Lamont knew that Hallam 
would be humiliated and irritated 
by such a procedure since he would 
not follow the mathematics. La- 
mont counted on that. 

Hallam growled, “See here, 
young man, I have no time now to 
engage in a full discussion of any 
aspect of para-theory. You send me 
a complete report and, for now, if 
you have some brief statement as 



to what you’re getting at, you may 
make it.” 

Lamont walked away from the 
thixo-board, an unmistakable ex- 
pression of contempt on his face. 
He said, “All right. The Second 
Law of Thermodynamics de- 
scribes a process that inevitably 
chops off extremes. Water doesn’t 
run downhill — what really happens 
is that extremes of gravitational 
potential are equalized. Water 
will just as easily bubble uphill if 
trapped underground. You can 
get work out of the juxtaposition 
of two different temperature levels, 
but the end result is that the tem- 
perature is equalized at an 
intermediate level — the hot body 
cools down and the cold body 
warms up. Both cooling and 
warming are equal aspects of 
Second Law and, under, the 
proper circumstances, equally 
spontaneous.” 

“Don’t teach me elementary 
thermodynamics, young man. 
What is it you want? I have very 
little time.” 

Lamont said, with no change of 
expression, no sense of being 
hurried. “Work is obtained out of 
the Electron Pump by an equali- 
zation of extremes. In this case 
the extremes are the physical 
laws of the two Universes. The 
conditions that make those laws 
possible, whatever those condi- 
tions may be, are being bled from 
one Universe into the other and 
the end result of the entire process 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



37 




will be two Universes in which 
the laws of nature will be identical 
— and intermediate as compared 
with the situation now. Since this 
will produce uncertain but un- 
doubtedly large changes in this 
Universe, it would seem that 
serious consideration must be 
given to stopping the Pumps and 
shutting down the whole operation 
permanently.” 

It was at this point that Lamont 
expected Hallam to explode and 
cut off any chance of further ex- 
planation. Hallam did not fail 
that expectation. He sprang out 
of his chair, which fell over. He 
kicked the chair away and took 



the two steps that separated him 
from Lamont. 

Lamont warily pushed back his 
own chair and stood up. 

“You idiot!” shouted Hallam. 
“Don’t you suppose everyone at 
the station understands about the 
equalization of natural law? Are 
you wasting my time telling me 
something I knew when you were 
learning to read? Get out of here — 
and any time you want to offer me 
your resignation, consider it 
accepted.” 

Lamont left, having obtained 
exactly what he wanted. And yet 
he felt himself to be furious over 
Hallam’s treatment of him. 



6 (concluded) 

A NYWAY,” said Lamont, “it clears the ground. I’ve tried 
to tell him. He wouldn’t listen. So I take the next step.” 

“And what is that?” said Bronowski. 

“I’m going to see Senator Burt.” 

“You mean the head of the Committee on Technology and the 
Environment?” 

“The same. You’ve heard of him?” 

“Who hasn’t? But where’s the point, Pete? What have you got 
that would interest him? It’s not the translation. Pete, I’m asking 
you once again: what have you got on your mind?” 

“I can’t explain. You don’t know para-theory.” 

“Does Senator Burt?” 

“More than you, I think.” 

Bronowski pointed his finger. “Pete, let’s not kid around. Maybe 
I know things you don’t. We can’t work together if we work against 
each other. Either I’m a member of this little two-man corporation 
or I’m not. You tell me what’s on your mind and I’ll tell you 



38 



GALAXY 




something in exchange. Otherwise, let’s stop this altogether.” 
Lamont shrugged. “All right. If you want it I’ll give it to you. 
Now that I’ve got it past Hallam, maybe it’s just as well. The 
point is that the Electron Pump is transferring natural law. In the 
para-Universe the strong interaction is a hundred times what it is 
here — which means that nuclear fission is much more likely here 
than there and nuclear fusion is much more likely there than here. 
If the Electron Pump keeps on long enough, there will be a final 
equilibrium in which the strong nuclear interaction will be equal 
in both Universes. That would make it about ten times what it is 
here now and one-tenth what it is there now.” 

“Didn’t anyone know this?” 

“Oh, sure, everyone knew it. It was obvious almost from the start. 
Even Hallam can see it. That’s what got the bastard so excited. I 
started telling him this in detail, as though I didn’t think he had 
ever heard it before and he blew up.” 

“But what’s the point, then? Is there danger in the interaction’s 
becoming intermediate?” 

“Of course. What do you think?” 

“I don’t think anything. When will it become intermediate?” 

“At the present rate, 10^“ years or so.” 

“How long is that?” 

“Long enough for a trillion trillion Universes like this one to be 
born, live, grow old and die, one after the other.” 

“Oh, blazes, Pete. What odds does it make then?” 

“Because to reach that figure,” said Lamont slowly and carefully, 
“which is the official one, certain assumptions were made that I 
think were wrong. And if certain other assumptions are made — 
which I think are right — we’re in trouble now.” 

“What kind of trouble?” 

“Suppose the Earth turned into a whiff of gas in a period of about 
five minutes. Would you consider that trouble?” 

“Because of the Pumping?” 

“Because of the Pumping.” 

“And how about the world of the para-men? Would they be in 
danger, too?” 

“I’m sure of it. A different danger, but danger.” 

Bronowski stood up and began pacing. He wore his brown hair 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



39 




thick and long in what had once been called a Buster Brown. Now he 
was clutching at it. He said, “If the para-men are more intelligent 
than we are, would they be running the Pump? Surely they would 
know it was dangerous before we did.” 

“I’ve thought of that,” said Lamont. “What I guess is that 
they’ve started Pumping for the first time and they, like us, got the 
process started for the apparent good it would bring and worried 
about consequences later.” 

“But you say you know the consequences now. Would they be 
slower than you were?” 

“It depends on if and when they look for those consequences. 
The Pump is too attractive to try to spoil. I wouldn’t have looked 
myself if I hadn’t — But what’s on >’o«r mind, Mike?” 

Bronowski stopped his pacing, looked fully at Lamont and said, 
“I think we’ve got something.” 

Lamont stared at him wildly, then leaped forward to seize the 
other’s sleeve. “With the para-symbols? Tell me, Mike!” 

“It happened while you were with Hallam. While you were actu- 
ally with Hallam. I haven’t known exactly what to do about it, 
because I wasn’t sure what was going on. And now — ” 

“And now?” 

“I’m still not sure. One of their foils came through — with four 
symbols.” 

“Oh?” 

“In the Latin alphabet. And it can be pronounced.” 

“What?” 

Bronowski produced the foil with the air of a conjurer. Incised 
on it, quite different from the delicate and intricate spirals and 
differential glistenings of the para-symbols, were four broad, child- 
like letters: F-E-E-R. 

“What do you suppose that means?” asked Lamont, blankly. 
“So far all I’ve been able to think of is that it’s F-E-A-R 
misspelled.” 

“Is that why you were cross-examining me? You thought someone 
on the other side was experiencing fear?” 

“And I thought it might have some connection with your own 
obviously increasing excitement over the last month. Frankly, Pete, 
I didn’t like being kept in the dark.” 



GALAXY 




“Okay. Now let’s not jump to conclusions. You’re the one with 
experience with fragmentary messages. Wouldn’t you say that the 
para-men were beginning to experience fear concerning the Electron 
Pump?’’ 

“Not necessarily,’’ said Bronowski. “I don’t know how much they 
can sense of this Universe. If they can sense the tungsten we lay out 
for them — if they can sense our presence — perhaps they are sensing 
our state of mind. Perhaps they are trying to reassure us, tell us there 
is no reason to fear.’’ 

“Then why don’t they say N-O F-E-E-R?’’ 

“Because they may not know our language that well.’’ 

“Hmm. Then I can’t take it to Burt.’’ 

“I wouldn’t. It’s ambiguous. In fact, I wouldn’t go to Burt until 
we get something more from the other side. Who knows what 
they’re trying to say?’’ 

“No, I can’t wait, Mike. I know I’m right and we have no time.’’ 

“All right, but if you see Burt you’ll be burning your bridges. 
Your colleagues will never forgive you. Have you thought of talking 
to the physicists here? You can’t put pressure on Hallam on your 
own, but a whole group of you 

Lamont shook his head vigorously. “Not a chance. The men at 
this station survive by virtue of their jellyfish quality. There isn’t 
one who would stand against him. Trying to rally the others to put 
pressure on Hallam would be like asking strands of cooked spaghetti 
to come to attention.’’ 

Bronowski’s soft face looked unwontedly grim. “You may be 
right.’’ 

“I know I’m right,’’ said Lamont just as grimly. 



7 

I T HAD taken time to pin the 
Senator down, time that La- 
mont had resented losing — the 
more so since nothing further in 
Latin letters had come from the 
para-men. No message of any kind, 

THE GODS THEMSELVES 



though Bronowski had sent across 
half a dozen, each with a carefully 
selected combination of para- 
symbols and each incorporating 
both F-E-E-R and F-E-A-R. 

Lamont was unsure of the signif- 
icance of the half-dozen variations 
but Bronowski had seemed hopeful. 

Yet nothing had happened and 

41 




now Lamont was at last in to see 
Burt. 

The Senator was thin-faced, 
sharp-eyed and elderly. He had 
been the head of the Committee on 
Technology and Environment 
for a generation. He took his job 
seriously. 

He fiddled now with the old- 
fashioned necktie that he affected 
(and that had become his trade- 
mark) and said, “I can only give 
you a half-hour, son.” He looked at 
his wristwatch. 

Lamont was not worried. He 
expected to interest Senator Burt 
enough to make him forget about 
time limits. He made no attempt to 
begin at the beginning — Burt had 
been briefed about the subject 
matter of the meeting in general. 

He said, “I won’t bother you with 
the mathematics. Senator, but I 
will assume you realize that 
through Pumping the natural laws 
of the two Universes are being 
mixed.” 

“Stirred together,” said the Sen- 
ator calmly, “with equilibrium 
coming in about 10’" years. Is that 
the figure?” His eyebrows in repose 
arched up and then down, giving his 
lined face a permanent air of sur- 
prise. 

“It is,” said Lamont, “but it is 
arrived at by assuming that the 
alien laws seeping into our Universe 
and theirs spread outward from the 
point of entry at the speed of light. 
That is just an assumption and I 
believe it to be wrong.” 



“Why?” 

“The only measured rate of mix- 
ing is within the plutonium-186 
sent into this Universe. That rate 
is extremely slow at first — pre- 
sumably because matter is dense — 
and increases with time. If the 
plutonium is mixed with less dense 
matter, the rate increases more 
rapidly. From a few measurements 
of this sort it has been calculated 
that the permeation rate would 
increase to the speed of light in a 
vacuum. It would take some time 
for the alien laws to work their way 
into the atmosphere, far less time to 
work their way to the top of the 
atmosphere and then off through 
space in every direction at 300,000 
kilometers per second, thinning 
into harmlessness in no time.” 

Lamont paused for a moment to 
consider how best to go on and the 
Senator picked it up at once. 
“However — ” he urged in the 
manner of a man not willing to 
waste time. 

“It’s a convenient assumption 
that seems to make sense and seems 
to make no trouble — but what if it 
is not matter that offers resistance 
to the permeation of the alien laws, 
but the basic fabric of the Universe 
itself?” 

“What is the basic fabric?” 

“I can’t put it into words. There 
is a mathematical expression that I 
think represents it, but we don’t 
have the words. The basic fabric of 
the Universe is that which dictates 
the laws of nature. It is the basic 



42 



GALAXY 




fabric of our Universe that makes 
it necessary for energy to be con- 
served. It is the basic fabric of the 
para-Universe, with a weave, so to 
speak, somewhat different from 
ours, that makes their nuclear 
interaction a hundred times 
stronger than ours.” 

“And so?” 

“If it is the basic fabric that is 
being penetrated, sir, then the 
presence of matter, dense or not, 
can have only a secondary influ- 
ence. The rate of penetration is 
greater in a vacuum than in dense 
mass, but not very much greater. 
The rate of penetration in outer 
space may be great in Earthly 
terms but it is only a small fraction 
of the speed of light.” 

“Which means?” 

“That the alien fabric is not 
dissipating as quickly as we think, 
but is piling up, so to speak, within 
the solar system to a much greater 
concentration than we have been 
assuming.” 

“I see,” said the Senator, 
nodding. “And how long will it be 
by your estimate, before the space 
within the solar system is brought 
to equilibrium? Less than 10^“ 
years? 

“Far less, sir. Less than 10'“ 
years, I think. Perhaps fifty billion 
years, give or take a couple of 
billion.” 

“Not much in comparison, but 
enough, eh? No immediate cause 
for alarm, eh?” 

“But I’m afraid there is imme- 



diate cause for alarm, sir. Damage 
will be done long before equilib- 
rium is reached. Because of the 
Pumping, the strong nuclear inter- 
action is growing steadily stronger 
in our Universe at every moment.” 
“Enough stronger to measure?” 
“Perhaps not, sir.” 

“Not even after twenty years of 
Pumping?” 

“Perhaps not, sir.” 

“Then why worry?” 

“Because, sir, upon the strength 
of the strong nuclear interaction 
rests the rate at which hydrogen 
fuses to helium in the core of the 
sun. If the interaction strengthens 
even unnoticeably, the rate of hy- 
drogen fusion in the sun will in- 
crease markedly. The sun 
maintains the balance between 
radiation and gravitation with 
great delicacy and to upset that 
balance in favor of radiation, as 
we are now doing — ” 

“Yes?” 

“Will cause an enormous ex- 
plosion. Under our laws of nature 
it is impossible for a star as small 
as the sun to become a supernova. 
Under the altered laws it may not 
be. I doubt that we would have 
warning. The sun could build up to 
a vast explosion and in eight min- 
utes after that you and I will be 
dead and the Earth will quickly 
vaporize into an expanding puff of 
gas.” 

“And nothing can be done?” 

“If it is too late to avoid upsetting 
the equilibrium — nothing. If it is 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



43 




not yet too late, then we must stop 
Pumping.” 

T he Senator cleared his throat. 

“Before I agreed to see you, 
young man, I inquired as to your 
background since you were not 
personally known to me. Among 
those I queried was Dr. Hallam. 
You know him, I suppose?” 

“Yes, sir.” A corner of Lamont’s 
mouth twitched but his voice held 
even. “I know him well.” 

“He told me,” said the Senator, 
glancing at a paper on his desk, 
“that you are a trouble-making 
idiot of doubtful sanity and he de- 
manded that I refuse to see you.” 
Lamont said in a voice he strove 
to keep calm. “Are those his words, 
sir?” 

“His exact words.” 

“Then why have you agreed to 
see me, sir?” 

“Ordinarily, if I received some- 
thing like this from Hallam I 
wouldn’t have seen you. My time 
is valuable and heaven knows I see 
more trouble-making idiots of 
doubtful sanity than bears thinking 
of, even among those who come to 
me with the highest recommen- 
dations. In this one case, though, 
I didn’t like Hallam’s ‘demand.’ 
You don’t make demands of a 
Senator, and Hallam had better 
learn that.” 

“Then you will help me, sir?” 
“Help you do what?” 

“Why — arrange to have the 
Pumping halted.” 



“That? Not at all. Quite 
impossible.” 

“Why?” demanded Lamont. 
“You are the head of the Commit- 
tee on Technology and Environ- 
ment and it is precisely your task 
to stop the Pumping — or any tech- 
nological procedure that threatens 
irreversible harm to the environ- 
ment. There can be no greater, no 
more irreversible harm than is 
threatened by Pumping.” 
“Certainly. Certainly — if you 
are right. But it seems that what 
your story amounts to is that your 
assumptions are different from the 
accepted ones. Who’s to say which 
set of assumptions is right?” 

“Sir, the structure I have built 
explains several things that are 
left doubtful in the accepted view.” 
“Well, then, your colleagues 
ought to accept your modification 
and in that case you would scarcely 
have to come to me, I imagine.” 
“Sir, my colleagues will not 
believe. Their self-interest stands 
in the way.” 

“As your self-interest stands in 
the way of your believing you might 
be wrong. Young man, my powers, 
on paper, are enormous — but I can 
only succeed when the public is 
willing to let me. I want to give you 
a lesson in practical politics.” 

He looked again at his wrist- 
watch, leaned back and smiled. His 
offer was not characteristic of him, 
but an editorial in the Terrestrial 
Post that morning had referred to 
him as “a consummate politician, 



44 



GALAXY 




the most skilled in the International 
Congress” and the glow that the 
description had aroused in him still 
lingered. 

“It is a mistake,” he said, “to 
suppose that the public wants the 
environment protected or their 
lives saved and that they will be 
grateful to any idealist who will 
fight for such ends. What the pub- 
lic wants is comfort. We learned 
that lesson during the environ- 
mental crisis of the twentieth 
century. When it became known 
that cigarettes increased the inci- 
dence of lung cancer the obvious 
remedy was to stop smoking — but 
the desired remedy was a cigarette 
that did not encourage cancer. 
When it became clear that the 
internal-combustion engine was 
polluting the atmosphere danger- 
ously, the obvious remedy was to 
abandon such engines — and the 
desired remedy was to develop non- 
polluting engines. 

“Now then, young man, don’t 
ask me to stop the Pumping. The 
economy and comfort of the entire 
planet depend on it. Tell me in- 
stead how to keep the Pumping 
from exploding the sun.” 

I AMONT said, “There is no way, 
j Senator. We are dealing with 
something so basic that we can’t 
play with it. We must stop it.” 
“Ah, and you can suggest only 
that we go back to matters as they 
were before Pumping.” 

“We must.” 



“In that case you will need hard 
and fast proof that you are right.” 
“The best proof,” said Lamont 
stiffly, “is to let the sun explode.” 
“Why can’t you get Hallam to 
back you up?” 

“Because he is a small man who 
finds himself the Father of the 
Electron Pump. How can he admit 
his child will destroy the Earth?” 

“I see what you mean, but he is 
still the Father of the Electron 
Pump to the whole world and only 
his word would carry sufficient 
weight in this respect.” 

Lamont shook his head. “He 
would never give in. He would 
rather see the sun blow up.” 

The Senator said, “Then force 
his hand. You have a theory but a 
theory by itself is meaningless. 
Surely there must be some way of 
checking it. The rate of radioactive 
breakdown of, say, uranium de- 
pends on the interactions within 
the nucleus. Has that rate been 
changing in a fashion predicted by 
your theory but not the standard 
one?” 

Again Lamont shook his head. 
“Ordinary radioactivity depends on 
the weak nuclear interaction and 
unfortunately experiments of that 
sort will yield only borderline evi- 
dence. By the time it showed suf- 
ficiently to be unmistakable, it 
would be too late.” 

“What else, then?” 

“There are pion interactions of 
a specific sort that might yield un- 
mistakable data now. Better still. 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



45 




there are quark-quark combina- 
tions that have produced puzzling 
results recently that 1 am sure I 
can explain — ” 

“Well, there you are.” 

“Yes, but in order to obtain that 
data, I must make use of the large 
proton synchrotron on the moon, 
sir, and no time on that will be 
available for years — I’ve checked 
— unless someone pulls the 
strings.” 

“Meaning me?” 

“Meaning you. Senator.” 

“Not as long as Dr. Hallam says 
this about you, son.” Senator 
Burt’s gnarled finger tapped the 
piece of paper in front of him. “1 
can’t get out on that limb.” 

“But the existence of the 
world — ” 

'"Prove it.” 

“Override Hallam and I’ll prove 
it.” 

“Prove it and I’ll override 
Hallam.” 

Lament drew a deep breath, 
“Senator! Suppose there’s just a 
trifling chance I’m right. Isn’t 
even that trifling chance worth 
being tested out? The results could 
mean everything for all mankind, 
the entire planet — ” 

“You want me to fight the good 
fight. I’d like to. There’s a certain 
drama in going down in a good 
cause. Any decent politician is 
masochistic enough to dream now 
and then of going down in flames 
while the angels sing. But, Dr. 
Lamont, to do that one has to have 



a fighting chance. One has to have 
something to fight for that may — 
just may — win out. If I back you on 
what you’ve shown so far I’ll 
accomplish nothing. It’s your word 
alone against the infinite desir- 
ability of Pumping. Shall 1 demand 
that every man give up the personal 
comfort and affluence he has 
learned to get used to, thanks to the 
Pump, just because one man cries 
doom while all the other scientists 
stand against him and the revered 
Hallam calls him an idiot? No, sir. 
I will not go down in flames for 
nothing.” 

Lamont said, “Then just help me 
find my proof. You needn’t appear 
in the open if you fear — ” 

“I’m not afraid,” said Burt 
abruptly. “I’m being practical. 
Dr. Lamont, your half-hour is 
rather more than gone.” 

Lamont stared in frustration. 
Burt’s expression was clearly 
intransigent now. Lamont left. 

Senator Burt did not see his next 
visitor immediately. Minutes 
passed while he stared uneasily at 
the closed door and fiddled with 
his tie. Could the man have been 
right? Could he have had the 
smallest chance of being right? 

He had to admit it would be a 
pleasure to trip Hallam and push 
his face into the mud and sit on 
him until he choked — but it would 
not happen. Hallam was untouch- 
able. Burt had had only one set-to 
with Hallam nearly ten years ago. 
He had been right, dead right, and 



46 



GALAXY 




Hallam had been egregiously 
wrong and events had since proved 
it. Yet at the time Burt had been 
humiliated and had almost lost 
reelection as a result. 

Burt shook his head in admoni- 
tion to himself. He might risk 
reelection in a good cause, but he 
could not risk humiliation again. 
He signaled for the next visitor and 
his face was calm and bland as he 
rose to greet him.

B y this time, Lamont’s 
theories had begun to sink 
into his own awareness. Earth — his 
whole Universe, in fact — spun on 
the brink of becoming Man’s 
broken toy and nobody would 
listen. He was sure of his stance and 
it was this, far more than the desire 
to show up Hallam, that drove him 
to see Joshua Chen. 

Chen was universally unpopular 
and anyone who dealt with him was 
in bad odor at once in almost every 
corner of the Establishment. Chen 
was a one-man revolutionary whose 
single voice could somehow always 
be heard because he brought to his 
causes an intensity that was utterly 
overpowering — and because he had 
built an organization that was 
more tightly knit than any ordinary 
political team in the world (as more 
than one politician was ready to 
swear). 

Chen had been one of the impor- 



tant factors accounting for the 
speed with which the Pump had 
taken over the planet’s energy 
needs. The Pump’s virtues were 
clear and obvious, as clear as non- 
pollution and as obvious as a free 
ride — yet there might have been a 
longer rear-guard fight by those 
who wanted fission, not because it 
was better but because it had been 
the friend of their childhood. 

When Chen beat his drums the 
world listened just a little harder. 
He faced Lamont, his broad cheek- 
bones and round face bearing 
evidence of his approximately 
three-quarter admixture of Chinese 
ancestry and of ancient combat 
wisdom. 

He said, “Let me get this 
straight. You’re speaking only for 
yourself?” 

“Yes,” said Lamont tightly. 
“Hallam doesn’t back me. In fact, 
Hallam says I’m mad. Do you have 
to have Hallam’s approval before 
you can move?” 

“I need no one’s approval,” said 
Chen with predictable arrogance, 
then lapsed back into thoughtful 
consideration. “You say the para- 
men are farther advanced in 
technology than we are?” 

Lamont had gone that far in the 
direction of compromise. He had 
avoided saying they were more 
intelligent. Farther advanced in 
technology. was less offensive 
and just as true. 

“That is clear,” said Lamont. 
“They can send material across the 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



47 




gap between the Universes and we 
can’t.” 

“Then why did they start the 
Pump if it is (^angerous? Why are 
they continuing it?” 

Lament was learning to compro- 
mise in more than one direction. 
He might have said that Chen was 
not the first to ask this, but the 
words would have sounded conde- 
scending, perhaps impatient. He 
chose not to say them. 

“They were anxious to get 
started with something so appar- 
rently desirable as a source of 
energy, just as we were. I have 
reason to think they’re as disturbed 
about it now as I am.” 

“That’s still your word. You have 
no definite evidence about their 
state of mind.” 

“None that 1 can present at this 
moment.” 

“Then it’s not enough.” 

“Can we afford to risk 
“It’s not enough. Professor. 
There’s no evidence. I haven’t 
built my reputation by shooting 
down targets at random. My 
missiles have sped true to the mark 
every time because I knew what I 
was doing.” 

“But when I get the evidence — ” 
“Then I’ll back you. If the evi- 
dence satisfies me I assure you that 
neither Hallam nor the Congress 
will be able to resist the tide. So get 
the evidence and come see me 
again.” 

“But by then it will be too late.” 
Chen shrugged. “Perhaps. Much 



more likely is that you will find that 
you are wrong and no evidence is 
to be had.” 



^^T’M NOT wrong.” Lamont 

X took a deep breath and 
continued in a confidential tone; 
“Mr. Chen, there are very likely 
trillions upon trillions of inhabited 
planets in the Universe and among 
them there may be billions with 
intelligent life and highly developed 
technologies. The same is probably 
true of the para-Universe. It must 
be that in the history of the two 
Universes there have been many 
pairs of worlds that came into 
contact and began Pumping. There 
may be dozens or even hundreds of 
Pumps scattered across junction 
points of the two Universes.” 

“Pure speculation. But if so?” 

“Then it may be that in dozens 
or hundreds of cases the mixture 
of natural law advanced locally to 
an extent sufficient to explode a 
planet’s sun. The effect might have 
spread outward. The energy of a 
supernova added to the changing 
natural law may have set off 
explosions among neighboring 
stars, which in turn set off others. 
In time perhaps an entire core of a 
galaxy or of a galactic arm will 
explode.” 

“But that is only imagination, 
of course.” 

“Is it? There are hundreds of 
quasars in the Universe; tiny bodies 
the size of several solar systems but 



48 



GALAXY 




shining with the light of a hundred 
full-size galaxies.” 

“You’re telling me that the 
quasars are what are left of Pump- 
ing planets?” 

“I’m suggesting that. In the 
century and a half since they were 
discovered astronomers have 
failed to account for their sources 
of energy. Nothing in this Universe 
will account for it nothing. 
Doesn’t it follow then” 

“What about the para-Uni- 
verse? Is it full of quasars, too?” 
“I wouldn’t think so. Conditions 
are different there. Para-theory 
makes it seem quite definite that 
fusion takes place much more 
easily over there, so their stars 
must be considerably smaller than 
ours on the average. There it would 
take a much smaller supply of 
easily fusing hydrogen to produce 
the energy our sun does a supply 
as large as that of our sun would 
explode spontaneously. If our 
laws permeate the para-Universe 
their hydrogen will become a little 
more difficult to fuse — the para- 
stars begin to cool down.” 

“Well, that’s not so bad,” said 
Chen. “The para-men can use 
Pumping to supply themselves with 
the necessary energy. By your 
speculations they’re in fine shape.” 
“Not really,” said Lamont. 
“Once our end explodes the Pump- 
ing stops. They can’t keep it up 
without us and that means they’ll 
face a cooling star without Pump 
energy. They might be worse off 



than we — we’d go out in a painless 
flash while their agony would be 
long drawn out.” 

“You have a good imagination, 
Pr&fessor,” said Chen, “but I’m 
not buying it. I don’t see any chance 
of our giving up Pumping on 
nothing more than your imagina- 
tion. Do you know what the Pump 
means to mankind? It’s not just the 
free, clean and copious energy. 
Look beyond that. What it means 
is that man no longer has to work 
for a living. It means that for the 
first time in history, mankind can 
turn its collective brain to the 
more important problem of devel- 
oping its true potential. For 
instance- not all the medical 
advances of two and a half 
centuries have succeeded in 
advancing man’s full life-span 
much past a hundred years. We’ve 
been told by gerontologists over 
and over that there is nothing, in 
theory, to stand in the way of 
human immortality, but so far not 
enough attention has been concen- 
trated on this.” 

Lamont said angrily, “Immor- 
tality? You’re talking of pipe- 
dreams.” 

“Perhaps you’re a judge of pipe- 
dreams, Professor,” said Chen. 
“But I intend to see that research 
into immortality begins. It won’t 
begin if Pumping ends. Then we 
are back to expensive energy, 
scarce energy, dirty energy. Earth’s 
two billions will have to go back to 
work for a living and the pipe- 



THE GODS THEMSELVES 



49 




dream of immortality will remain a 
pipe-dream.” 

“It will anyway. No one is going 
to be immortal. No one is even 
going to live out a normal 
lifetime.” 

“Ah, but that is only your 
theory.” 

Lamont weighed the possibilities 
and decided to gamble. “Mr. Chen, 
a while ago I said I was not willing 
to explain my knowledge of the 
state of mind of the para-men. 
Well, let me try. We have been 
receiving messages.” 

“Yes, but can you interpret 
them?” 

“We received an English word.” 

Chen frowned. He suddenly put 
his hands in his pockets, stretched 
his short legs before him and leaned 
back in his chair. 

“And what was the word?” 

“Fear.” Lamont did not feel it 
necessary to mention the 
misspelling. 

“Fear?” repeated Chen. “And 
what do you think it means?” 

“Isn’t it clear that they’re afraid 
of the Pumping phenomenon?” 

“Not at all. If they were afraid 
they would stop it. I think they’re 
afraid, all right, but they’re afraid 
that our side will stop. You’ve 
gotten across your intention to 
them and if we stop it, as you want 
us to do, they’ve got to stop also. 
You said yourself they can’t 
continue without us — it’s a two- 
ended proposition. I don’t blame 
them for being afraid.” 



Lamont sat silent. 

“I see,” said Chen, “that you 
haven’t thought of that. Well, then, 
we’ll push for immortality. 1 think 
that will be the more popular 
cause.” 

“Oh, popular causes,” said 
Lamont, slowly. “I didn’t under- 
stand what you found important. 
How old are you, Mr. Chen?” 

Chen blinked, then turned away. 
He left the room, walking rapidly, 
his hands clenched. 

Lamont looked up his biography 
later. Chen was sixty and his father 
had died at sixty-two. But it didn’t 
matter.

OU don’t look as though 
X you had any luck at all,” 
said Bronowski. 

Lamont was sitting in his labora- 
tory, staring at the toes of his shoes 
and noting idly that they seemed 
unusually scuffed. He shook his 
head. 

“No.” 

“Even the great Chen failed 
you.” 

“He would do nothing. He wants 
evidence, too. They all want evi- 
dence, but anything I offer them is 
rejected. What they really want is 
their damned Pump, or their 
reputation, or their place in history. 
Chen wants immortality. 

“What do you want, Pete?” 
asked Bronowski softly.

“Mankind’s safety,’’ said La- 
ment. He looked at the other’s 
quizzical eyes. “You don’t believe 
me.’’ 

“Oh, I believe you. But what do 
you really want?’’ 

“Well, then, by God — ’’ Lament 
brought his hand down flat on the 
desk before him in a loud slap — 
“I want to be right — and I am 
right.” 

“You’re sure?” 

“I am sure. And there’s nothing 
I am worried about, because 1 
intend to win. You know — when 1 
left Chen I came near to despising 
myself.” 

“You?” 

“Yes, 1. Why not? I thought — At 
every turn Hallam stops me. As 
long as Hallam refutes me everyone 
has an excuse not to believe me. 
While Hallam stands like a rock 
against me, I must fail. Why didn’t 
I work through him? Why didn’t 
I butter him up, indeed? Why didn’t 
I maneuver him into supporting me 
instead of needling him into 
fighting me?” 

“Do you think you could have?” 

“No. As you imply, nothing 
could have turned him against the 
Pump. Of course, when I first 
turned him against me, there was 
as yet no question of Earth’s doom, 
but I took care to make my rela- 
tionship with him worse when that 
question arose. In my despair 1 
thought — well, all sorts of things. 
I even thought of emigrating to the 
moon colony if they’d accept my 



type of ability among their 
scientists. I wasn’t sure they 
would.” 

“But you don’t seem to despise 
yourself now.” 

“No. Because my conversation 
with Chen brought a dividend. It 
showed me I was wasting time.” 
“So it would seem.” 

“Yes, but needlessly. It is not 
here on Earth that the solution lies. 
I told Chen that our sun might blow 
up but the para-sun would not, yet 
that would not save the para-men, 
for when our sun blew and our end 
of the Pump halted, so would 
theirs. They cannot continue 
without us, do you see?” 

“Yes, of course I see.” 

“Then why don’t we think of the 
reverse? We can’t continue without 
them. In which case, who cares 
whether we stop the Pump or not? 
Let’s get the para-men to stop.” 
“Ah, but will they?” 

“They said F-E-E-R. And it 
means they’re afraid. Chen said 
they feared that we would stop the 
Pump — but I don’t believe that for 
a moment. They are simply afraid 
as you and I are. I sat silent when 
Chen made his suggestion. He 
thought he had me. He was quite 
wrong. I was only thinking at that 
moment that we had to get the 
para-men to stop. And we’ve got to. 
Mike, I abandon everything except 
you. You’re the hope of the world. 
Get through to them somehow.” 
Bronowski laughed and there was 
almost a childlike glee in the sound. 



THE GODS THEMSELVES

“Pete,” he said, “you’re a genius.” 
“Aha. You’ve noticed.” 

“No, I mean it. You guess what 
I want to say before 1 can say it. 
I’ve been sending message after 
message, using their symbols in a 
way that I guessed might signify the 
Pump and using our word as well. 
And I did my best to gather what 
information I’ve scrabbled together 
over many months to use their 
symbols in a way signifying disap- 
proval and using an English word 
again. I had no idea whether I was 
getting through or was a mile off 
base and — from the fact that I 
never got an answer — I had little 
hope.” 

“You didn’t tell me what you 
were trying to do.” 

“Well, this part of the problem is 
my baby. You take your sweet time 
explaining para-theory to me.” 

“So what happened?” 

“So yesterday I sent off exactly 
two words — our language. I 
scrawled: P-U-M-P B-A-D.” 
“And?” 

“And this morning I picked up a 
return message at last. It’s simple 
enough and straightforward, too. 
It goes; Y-E-S P-U-M-P B-A-D 
B-A-D B-A-D. Here, look at it.” 



I AMONT’S hand trembled as it 
j held the foil. “There’s no mis- 
taking that, is there? That’s con- 
firmation, isn’t it?” 

“It seems so to me. Whom will 
you take this to?” 



“To no one,” said Lamont 
decisively. “I argue no more. They 
will tell me I faked the message 
and there’s no point in my ’sitting 
still for that. Let the para-men stop 
the Pump and it will stop on our 
side, too, and nothing we can do 
unilaterally will start it up again. 
The entire Station will then be on 
fire to prove that I was right and 
that the Pump is dangerous.” 
“How do you figure that? Be- 
cause it will be the only way they 
can keep themselves from being 
torn apart by a mob demanding 
the Pump and infuriated at not 
getting it?” 

“Well, maybe. But one thing 
bothers me.” 

“What’s that?” 

“If the para-men are so con- 
vinced that the Pump is dangerous, 
why haven’t they stopped it 
already? I took occasion to check 
a while ago and the Pump is 
working swimmingly.” Lamont 
frowned. “Perhaps they don’t want 
a unilateral stoppage. They may 
consider us their partners and want 
a mutual agreement to stop. Don’t 
you suppose that might be so?” 

“It might be. But it might also be 
that communication is less than 
perfect — that they don’t yet quite 
understand the significance of the 
word B-A-D. From what I said to 
them via their symbols, which I 
may well have twisted utterly, they 
may think that B-A-D means what 
we consider G-O-O-D.” 

“Oh, no.”

“Well, that’s your hope, but 
there’s no payoff on hopes.’’ 
“Mike, just keep on sending 
messages. Use as many of the 
words they use as possible and keep 
ringing the changes. You’re the 
expert and it’s in your hands. 
Eventually they’ll know enough 
words to say something clearly and 
unmistakably and then we’ll 
explain that we’re willing to have 
the Pump stopped.’’ 

“We lack the authority to make 
any such statement.’’ 

“Yes, but they won’t know, and 
in the end we’ll be mankind’s 
heroes.’’ 

“Even if they execute us first?’’ 
“Even so. It’s in your hands, 
Mike; and I’m sure it won’t take 
much longer.’’

AND yet it did. Two weeks 
±\. passed without another mes- 
sage and the strain grew worse. 

Bronowski showed it. His earlier 
lightness of heart had dissipated 
and he entered Lamont’s labora- 
tory in glum silence. 

They stared at each other and 
finally Bronowski said, “It’s all 
over the place that you’ve received 
your show-cause.’’ 

Lamont had not shaved that 
morning. His laboratory had a 
forlorn look about it, a not-quite- 
definable packing-up look. He 
shrugged. “So what? It doesn’t 



bother me. What does bother me 
is that Physical Reviews rejected 
my paper.’’ 

“You said you were expecting 
them to.’’ 

“Yes, but I thought they might 
give me reasons. They might have 
pointed out what they thought were 
fallacies, errors, unwarranted as- 
sumptions. Something I could 
argue about.’’ 

“And they didn’t?’’ 

“Not a word. Their referees did 
not consider the paper suitable for 
publication. Quote, unquote. They 
just won’t touch it. It’s really dis- 
heartening — the universal stupidity. 
I think that I wouldn’t grieve at 
mankind’s suicide through sheer 
evilness of heart or through mere 
recklessness. There’s something so 
damned undignified at going to 
destruction through simple thick- 
headed stupidity. What’s the use 
of being men if that’s how you have 
to die?’’ 

“Stupidity,’’ muttered Bronow- 
ski. 

“What else do you call it? And 
they want me to show cause why I 
ought not to be fired for the great 
crime of being right.’’ 

“Everyone seems to know that 
you consulted Chen.’’ 

“Yes.’’ Lamont put his fingers to 
the bridge of his nose and wearily 
rubbed it. “I apparently got him 
annoyed enough to go to Hallam 
with tales and now the accusation 
is that I have been trying to sab- 
otage the Pump project by unwar-

ranted and unsupported fright 
tactics in an unprofessional man- 
ner and that this makes me un- 
suitable for employment on the 
Station.” 

‘‘They can prove that easily, 
Pete.” 

‘‘I suppose they can. It doesn’t 
matter.” 

‘‘What are you going to do?” 

“Nothing,” said Lamont indig- 
nantly. “Let them do their worst. 
I’ll rely on red tape. Every step of 
this thing will take weeks, 
months — and meanwhile you keep 
working. We’ll hear from the 
para-men yet.” 

Bronowski looked miserable. 
“Pete, suppose we don’t. Maybe 
it’s time for you to think about 
this again.” 

Lamont looked up sharply. 
“What are you talking about?” 

“Tell them you’re wrong. Do 
penance. Beat your breast. Give 
up.” 

“Never! By God, Mike, we’re 
playing a game in which the stakes 
are all the world and every living 
creature on it.” 

“Yes, but what’s that to you? 



You’re not married. You have no 
children. 1 know your father is 
dead. You never mention your 
mother or any siblings. I doubt 
there is a human being to whom 
you are emotionally attached as an 
individual. So go your way and the 
hell with all this.” 

“And you?” 

“I’ll do the same. I’m divorced 
and I have no children. I have a 
young lady with whom I’m close 
and that relationship will continue 
while it can. Live! Enjoy!” 

“And tomorrow?” 

“Will take care of itself. Death 
when it comes will be quick.” 

“I can’t live with that philosophy. 
Mike. Mike! What is all this? Are 
you trying to tell me that we’re not 
going to get through? Are you 
giving up on the para-men?” 
Bronowski looked away. He said, 
“Pete, I did get an answer. Last 
night. I thought I’d wait for today 
and think about it, but why think? 
Here it is.” 

Lament’s eyes were staring 
questions. He took the foil and 
looked at it. There was no punctu- 
ation:

“By God,” muttered Bronowski. 
“They sound desperate.” 

Lamont was still staring. 

Bronowski said, “I gather that 
somewhere on the other side is 
someone like you — a para-Lamont. 
And he can’t get his para-Hallams 
to stop either. And while we’re 
begging them to save us, he’s 
begging us to save them.” 

Lamont said, “But if we show 
this—” 

“They’ll say you’re lying — that 
it’s a hoax you’ve concocted to save 
your psychotically conceived 
nightmare.” 

“They can say that of me, maybe, 
but they can’t say it of you. You’ll 
back me, Mike. You’ll testify that 
you received this and how.” 

Bronowski reddened. “What 
good would that do? They’d say 
that somewhere in the para-Uni- 
verse there is a nut like yourself 
and that two crackpots got to- 
gether. They’d say that the message 
proves that the constituted author- 
ities in the para-Universe are con- 
vinced there’s no danger.” 

“Mike, fight this through with 
me. 

“There’s no use, Pete. You said 



it yourself — stupidity. Those para- 
men may be more advanced than 
we are — but it’s plain to see that 
they’re just as stupid as we are and 
that ends it. Schiller pointed that 
out and I believe him.” 

“Who?” 

“Schiller. A German dramatist 
of three centuries ago. In a play 
about Joan of Arc, he wrote: 
‘Against stupidity, the gods them- 
selves contend in vain.’ I’m no god 
and I’ll contend no longer. Let it 
go, Pete, and go your way. Maybe 
the world will last our time and if 
not — there’s nothing that can be 
done anyway. I’m sorry, Pete. You 
fought the good fight, but you lost. 
And I’m through.” 

He was gone and Lamont was 
alone. He sat in his chair, fingers 
aimlessly drumming, drumming. 
Somewhere in the sun protons were 
clinging together with a trifling 
additional avidity and with each 
moment that avidity grew — and at 
some moment the delicate balance 
would break down. 

“And no one on Earth will live 
to know I was right,” cried out 
Lamont, and blinked to keep 
back the tears.

T om rohnagan landed at 

Critchlow on Edris. He looked 
at the booming surf, the wind- 
blown palms and the tawny beach. 
He rubbed his week-old beard and 
pushed his hat back on his head. 
His skin prickled with sweat in the 



coastal humidity. He stood in the 
shade of the Interface ship and 
waited while the ramp slid out and 
the cargomaster drove the battered 
prime mover and new trailer onto 
the concrete. 

Rohnagan hitched his pants and 
spat. He signed the delivery ticket 
and drove the rig to the Entry Port. 
He unlocked the trailer and opened 
all compartments for fumigation. 
Next door in the Doc’s office he 
heard the gates clunk together and 
seal, the pumps drop the pressure 
to half atmospheric and the decon- 
taminant whoosh \nio the chamber. 
He stripped and walked into the 
medical machine. 

It had a sickly bedside manner. 
“We’ve been overworking, haven’t 
we? Neglecting our health in the 
stress of affairs? Not enough exer- 
cise for the best muscle tonus, and 
the liver a little sluggish. A sound 
mind in a sound body — ” 

“Go to hell. Doc,” said 
Rohnagan. 

“ — tranquilizers are indicated 
and will be made available at cost 
by Bahia General Services. Please 
deposit the medical fee. For con- 
sultational reference while on Ed- 
ris, call 71-4765-0842. Have a nice 
day.” Critchlow was the oldest of 
the Bahia vacation cities but that 
was no excuse for a smarmy medi- 
cal machine. 

Rohnagan swore and waited out-

side while the fumigant decom- 
posed. The bay opened and he 
drove through the service and ware- 
house blocks of Critchlow, around 
the cliff with waves breaking on the 
rocks, to the city itself. The admin- 
istration offices were well back 
from the beach. He parked beside 
a row of flambeau trees in full 
bloom. He walked slowly to the 
building. His footsteps set up an 
echo in time. He had not seen flam- 
beaus for twenty years. He stopped 
in the shade and the echo steps 
stopped. He looked around but he 
was alone. The ghost of young Tom 
Rohnagan was standing beside 
him. So this was a joint venture, his 
own weight of experience coupled 
with young Tom’s observations of 
so long ago. 

T he clerk of mines was a lean 
old woman who could talk and 
type simultaneously. “A five-year 
lease and a five-year prospecting 
ticket, all righty. The maximum in 
both cases. You spell your name — 
ah-ha. Thumbprint here. You 
understand the mineral laws of 
Edris, hmm? I ask you pointedly 
because there is no rescue and no 
hard feelings, in acceptance of the 
Law of Limitation and the Fool’s 
Act. Sign here. Where is Bluewater, 
Mr. Rohnagan?” 

“Twelve hundred kilometers in.” 
“That awful desert and the 



parnmas, hmm? All those little 
eyes looking at you. A zoologist 
from College Station tried to eat 
one. He said it tasted like an owl 
boiled whole -special permit you 
understand — highest indigenous life 
— ecologically valuable — auburn 

hair, hazel eyes, male — they eat 
bugs — sign here.” 

“What’s the export duty these 
days?” 

“Ten dollars a hundred assessed 
valuation. It used to be twenty, but 
policy is to encourage development. 
Imagine a mineral-rich planet 
where the biggest money value is 
sand and gravel. Nobody wants to 
stay in the desert.” She cocked her 
head. “Don’t buy any expensive 
gear, Mr. Rohnagan, milling ma- 
chines or ball mills or classifiers. 
We have an abandonment ordi- 
nance and 1 can rent you whatever 
you will need. A man wakes up one 
morning and asks himself what am 
I doing here, hmm? Usually he 
leaves before breakfast, and before 
he eats he checks the Interface 
schedule. Then he’s another Long 
Gone John with the parnmas sitting 
around watching his equipment get 
covered over with sand.” 

Rohnagan said he liked the peace 
and quiet, thanked her and left. 
He took a cab to a bar called the 
Tap Easy. The bartender was an 
ex-prospector named Bellici, who 
told him that Jerry Korsmo had a 



58 



GALAXY 




nice little lead-galena strike before 
he hauled off, that Mercer Sel- 
domridge filed on copper but never 
proved up and that Lance Cozensa 
got some kunzite before he peeled 
out. “They come and mostly go,” 
said Bellici. “There was a funny 
pair a week ago, two-meter Swin- 
ney and his partner Gronewald, 
thirty centimeters shorter and they 
weighed the same. You wouldn’t 
believe. Oh, I brought out a sun- 
burn myself once and a thirst that 
hasn’t quit yet. All that empty! 
All them eyes!” 

“Uh-huh,” said Rohnagan. He 
finished his ceremonial drink and 
went back to the prime mover. He 
drove to the service area and gave 
his list to a supplier. The man put 
it into the proper code and, while 
they waited, told Rohnagan about 
Nan McAnn who had ordered the 
same things. The man figured it 
was a boom between busts in the 
mining cycle. He read a printout 
and said there had been six in the 
last two weeks — the McAnn 
woman, Poulin, Clark, Yanabu, 
Swinney and Gronewald — all out 
for riches. He laughed. “Tap easy, 
she’s deep enough, yuk-yuk. 1 
seen that desert. You can have my 
share.” 

Rohnagan put the packages into 
the trailer and drove to the nearest 
offtake pad, inland and uphill from 
the service area. He got out to 



stretch and look at the sunset. Here 
was the end and the beginning of 
his irresolution. 

He was not timid, irresponsible 
or unable to make up his mind. If 
a course of action was clear before 
him, he acted with vigor. He abom- 
inated principle as a movable brick 
wall and yet he worked from first 
principles. His irresolution was 
based on a fundamental human 
peculiarity — he wanted to be a 
good man, but what is good? 

He was not afraid of the desert. 
He approved of the Law of Limita- 
tion. Any authority must limit it- 
self or become an all-devouring 
monster. Go into the desert if you 
like, but save your breath to cool 
your porridge if you get into trou- 
ble. The Bahia cities endorsed the 
Fool’s Act as a philosophic base- 
you are free to kick a bear in the 
nose — and the price of freedom is 
personal responsibility. But what 
is good? 

The design and execution were 
good. The staff and class were 
arriving from a dozen planets. The 
conditioning was holding. He was 
comfortable in his role of pros- 
pector and was reasonably certain 
this would be a spectacular opera- 
tion from a monetary viewpoint. 
Good enough. But. 

Was his meddling justifiable? 

On what scale of values? From 
what viewpoint? At what price? 



220— ADVANCED FIELD EXPLORATION

How congruent was intelligence? 
Right, wrong or standing on his 
head, he was here. He spat. The 
point of no return had passed when 
he was born. He pulled down his 
hat, climbed into the prime mover 
and lifted into the air. He drove 
over the Coast range and set the 
guidance. He slept the night away 
over the howling wilderness. 

B LUEWATER was in a saddle 
of the Great Spineys, tucked 
between the paws of two hills. The 
water from the spring ran nearly a 
quarter kilometer before it was 
sucked into the air and down into 
the sand. The brush ran from 
green-gray to gray-white along the 
course of the stream. A few trees 
with lacy leaves and pink trunks 
stood around. A serpentine humped 
to one side, an intertwined mass of 
bright green withes with vivid coral 
blossoms. 

A pamma watched him land. He 
multigraved the trailer to check the 
gear. He left the sensors on. If a 
wind should rise, all points would 
keep in constant weight relation- 
ship with the planet. Six pammas 
sat in a row on a boulder — a pair 
each of diggers, flyers and lopers. 
He ignored their flat gray eyes and 
hauled the hosehead to the spring. 
The telltale stuttered amber and 
settled to green. The water was 
not blue, but it was potable. 



A happy-go-lucky bug bumbled 
around his head and flew away. 
The nearest pamma spat a sticky 
globule. The happy-go-lucky whir- 
red with tacky wings — the pamma 
ran out a telescoping arm to catch 
it in the air and pop it into his 
mouth. A pamma is shaped like 
an avocado. It has a constrictor 
mechanism in the sloping shoul- 
ders. It hunched and shrugged and 
continued to watch the man. 

He opened the stable door and 
brought out one of his two burros. 
It was a heavy-duty model that had 
all the options. He pushed the hee- 
haw button to give the pammas a 
treat. They took no notice. They sat 
in a row and blinked their button 
eyes out of synchronization. They 
always kept one eye open. When 
the wind carried sand, their eyes 
were puce with the nictitating mem- 
brane instead of gray. 

“Peace and quiet,” said 
Rohanagan. 

He climbed onto the burro and 
rode slowly to the top of the hill 
behind Bluewater. With the sun 
just over the horizon, the ridges and 
valleys and plains were defined by 
long shadows. The Great Spineys 
ran northeast-southwest, crest on 
blue crest, unnamed peaks rosy in 
the dawn glow. He felt himself 
relax from the tensions of civiliza- 
tion. He crossed his legs tailor fash- 
ion on the saddle and watched the 



60 



GALAXY 




landscape slowly meld as the sun 
rose. He turned the burro downhill 
on the homing circuit and was 
pleased with the way it chose a path 
over and around the rocky slope on 
its 424 wire legs. Pammas watched. 

He ignored them. 

“The bliss of solitude,” he said 
and believed it as he shut the stable 
door and went inside to unpack. 

He was perfectly happy for two 
weeks. He found wheat gold in a 
box canyon and dry-milled enough 
in five days to cast a standard ten- 
kilo bar. Off to the west he identi- 
fied an outcrop of WO 3 in case 
somebody needed tungsten. He 
crossed a saline-white dry lake to a 
relatively old range of hills and 
noted a natural cave. 

He did not quite believe it geolog- 
ically, but he crawled underground 
to a small cavern. It was bright red 
by torchlight and the floor sloped to 
a puddle of liquid mercury. He 
scooped up a handful of the heavy 
metal and poured it back. A 
pamma watched from the cave 
entrance and flippity-flopped ahead 
of him when he walked out. He 
studied the rock wall, drilled a pat- 
tern with a laser bit, loaded the 
holes with filgrinite twenty, fused 
them with his personal key-coded 
fuse and tried to shoo away the 
pammas. They sat above the cave 
and stared at him. 

Pammas are not lovable crea- 



tures. As insectivores they serve a 
purpose, but their fur breaks off in 
barbels and they have as interesting 
personalities as china doorknobs. 
Still and all, Rohnagan rode the 
burro along the hill and waited 
while the pammas re-assembled 
themselves before he blew the cave 
down. 

“That was a narrow escape,” he 
told them. “The love of money is 
the root of all evil, gang. Free 
mercury is too valuable. I came 
here to get away from it all. You 
can’t imagine the temptations out- 
side. I know your sex life is more 
complicated than mine because you 
get three kinds in one litter, but 1 
bet you never looked into a pool of 
mercury and sa\y a good-looking 
girl batting her eyes at you in sync. 
Dollar signs in them. Temptation 
of the devil, gang.” 

He pulled the triptape out of the 
burro and carefully cut away a sec- 
tion. “This won’t show on my map. 
Get a lot of people in here. Got to 
be careful, right?” 

A couple of flying pammas 
swooped through a cloud of gnats 
with their mottled gray-and- 
green mouths open, wind whis- 
tling through their strainers. They 
plopped down beside the others and 
shrugged their shoulders. 

Rohnagan drank a cup of cold 
tea from the burro’s reservoir and 
set off for Bluewater. He walked 



220— ADVANCED FIELD EXPLORATION 



61 




with an easy gait but when he 
found himself paying no attention 
to the formations, he mounted the 
burro and pushed the Home-James 
button. 

“I think the Doc was right,” he 
told a pamma sticking its head out 
of a burrow. “I need an application 
of tranquilizer.” 

The pamma blinked one eye. 

T WO men were soaking in a 
little pool below the spring. 
They were the long and short of it, 
Alf Spinney and Gurchie Grone- 
wald. They had run out of food and 
water and were lost besides. Roh- 
nagan said he had just escaped a 
fate worse than death and why 
hadn’t they got into the trailer and 
fed themselves? Alf was the tall 
one. He was shy. He sat in the 
water and sank so deep only his 
eyes and the tips of his red ears 
showed. Gurchie said they were 
honest men and couldn’t break into 
somebody’s trailer like that — be- 
sides they had just arrived. 

“I got the distiller going with 
red corn when I set up here,” said 
Rohnagan, “and it’s a violation of 
the Fool’s Act not to have a drink.” 
They suffered when they drank 
his whiskey. Their salivary glands 
squirted and their stomach juices 
sloshed. He reconstituted a couple 
of protinella patties and heated 
them in frozen buns. They vanished 



like snowballs thrown at pammas 
at high noon. 

He gave his guests another drink. 

“What are you boys looking for?” 

“Sun and bugs and sand and 
pammas, 1 guess,” said Gurchie. 

“So far we found experience,” 
said Alf. 

“And the crazy pammas 
watching.” 

“Sure a lot of nothing here.” 

Their eyes wandered and re- 
turned to the radar range. This time 
Rohnagan fed them a dozen little 
fish with a lively sauce on toast 
strips. The youngsters said they 
were broke but they hoped to pick 
up hand-loading jobs at the Bahia 
cities. All they had done so far was 
wear the legs down on their burros 
— but they would get back to pros- 
pecting when they were able. 

“I’ll grubstake you,” said Roh- 
nagan. He explained the term did 
not mean conveyance of property 
or a lien against future income. 
Alf said it was sure uncomfortable 
to ride with his feet on the burro’s 
neck to keep them from dragging. 
Rohnagan said you walk when you 
prospect and Alf showed him shoes 
with the soles worn out. 

“What’s to keep us from stealing 
this grubstake?” said Gurchie. 

“Not a thing. I gamble on a cut 
of your next trip. I’ll run you over 
to Critchlow because I want a 
change anyway.” 



62 



GALAXY 




“We could off-planet with your 
money.” 

“Sure enough.” 

“Where do you want our thumb- 
prints?” said Alf. 

“On your thumbs. What we do 
is shake hands and have a drink 
and then it’ll be supper time.” 

The next day they flew to Critch- 
low. He told them the block of gold 
was about 920 fine with copper and 
silver and he bought them a drink 
at the Tap Easy while he listened to 
their protests. 

“You might be lucky next time,” 
he said. “Get the best equipment 
and the best supplies.” 

They decided to try an area away 
from Bluewater, so Rohnagan left 
them, went to a restaurant to avoid 
his own cooking, had a few drinks 
and slept on guidance back to the 
trailer. 

“Good to be here. Things haven’t 
changed much. Far from the mad- 
ding crowd,” he said to the pam- 
mas. He puttered happily around 
the trailer and even lined out some 
rocks to indicate a path to the 
spring. “If I had white paint. I’d 
paint them white,” he said. 

A MAN named Rulon Clark 
dropped in the next day. He 
was very nice about it and asked if 
Rohnagan minded if he located 
there for a while. He played a good 
game of cribbage and made a su- 



perior sort of beer. He was a desir- 
able neighbor, Rohnagan supposed. 
Poulin pulled in and then Hartis, 
who only wanted water before he 
went off again. Nan McAnn ar- 
rived in a tired camper and made a 
fourth for bridge. Rohnagan was 
alarmed by the condition of her 
equipment and spent three days 
putting it into less perilous shape. 
She was a bossy, comfortable 
woman who liked cooking and had 
the devil’s own luck at cards. Col- 
vin and Trayloren sat two nights for 
poker and moved on. Mary Mayer- 
ling and Pierre Sutton and Ellaree 
Hill used Bluewater as a base. Roh- 
nagan woke one morning and said 
the hell with it. 

, i ^ . -I 

He packed one burro and rode 
the other for two days before he 
began walking. He knew about 
seismic, gravimetric, magnetic, 
electrical and radioactive prospec- 
ting, but he believed a real under- 
standing of minerals came through 
the soles of the feet. 

“What’s the use of being a fast 
prospector?” he asked the pammas. 
“All those people,” he grumbled. 
“How can you prospect in a herd?” 
He got no answer. “Sure, it’s nice 
to see somebody once in a while, 
but the social whirl is getting too 
damn thick.” 

He was working through broken 
country when he found tourmaline. 
He thought they were tourmaline 



220— ADVANCED FIELD EXPLORATION

crystals, pink and green. He passed 
them by, but he could not ignore a 
lenticular stone he found a few days 
later. It was adamantine. Fila- 
ments of grape purple shifted in a 
pale transparency as he turned it 
in his hand. He trembled and there 
was a ragged streak of yellow, in- 
tense pale lightning in the stone. 
He put it in a corner of his burro 
and found seven more similar 
stones before he came to his senses. 

“Never heard of such a thing,” 
he marveled. “Storm jewels! This 
is terrible!” The pammas blinked. 

He returned to Bluewater in a 
roundabout fashion to face another 
disaster. Alf and Gurchie had been 
there the day before and left a 
dozen oweins as his share of their 
grubstake expedition. The rough 
oweins were orange rocks. Faceted, 
they were orange fire. 

“Oh, hell,” he said to Nan Mc- 
Ann. “This is ridiculous. The lit- 
tlest is worth ten bars of gold. 1 hate 
honest men!” 

“They said their luck changed 
because of your grubstake. They 
made me give them some more of 
your supplies. Do you mind if I set 
up a store — I could get a lot of 
stuff with one owein.” 

“Whatever you want. You keep 
the things. Don’t bother me.” 

“A lot of people are prospecting 
now. Will it be all right if I grub- 
stake them a little?” 



“Oh, peace,” he said. “Oh, soli- 
tude! I’m taking off. I won’t be 
back until all these people fall off 
cliffs or fry their brains or thirst to 
death. Have they repealed the 
Fool’s Act? I never set out to be a 
founding father. I’m no real estate 
promoter — I never asked — ” 

“The boys brought you a sack of 
red corn, too,” she said soothingly. 
“I ran some through your hurry-up 
distiller.” 

“Terrible, terrible, terrible,” he 
grumbled, but he went to the 
trailer and soothed himself for a 
week. 

T he arrival of the foundation 
sobered him up. It was thirty- 
by-thirty meters. Nan said she got 
it at a bargain in Critchlow. It was 
the very first apartment moved into 
town, but tastes change and the 
new apartments came from Brum- 
migen in a modern decor and with 
the traveling base and support 
systems integral. The owners had a 
demolition party and tore up the 
insides, so she spent a little fuel 
and dumped the ravaged rooms 
toward the sun. 

“Did you spend the oweins?” 
His face fell when she said there 
were three of the largest left. “1 
don’t want money,” he grumbled. 
“Get rid of them.” 

He serviced his burros and fled 
Bluewater. 



64 



GALAXY 




He wandered into the Plains of 
Doom, a fancifully named area 
intricately undercut with caverns. 
The gossip was that the plains 
claimed the lives of four <wt of ten 
prosf)ectors who ventured onto 
them. What saved Rohnagan’s life 
were the inertial antigravity units 
built into the burros. Choosing a 
route with a lifetime of geological 
skill, he still found the treacherous 
footing collapsing under him time 
and , again. The burros dropped 
free for fifty centimeters and nulled 
gravity in another fifty. 

“Sure-footed little beasts,” Roh- 
nagan told the pammas. 

He followed one series of caves 
for kilometers and spent two nights 
underground. He found the first 
blush pearl and all his rationality 
vanished. The pearl was a spheroid 
as large as his thumbnail with a 
pale pink infusion. He held it in the 
palm of his hand and fell into it 
dreaming — until he fortunately fell 
on the hee-haw button. The pink 
world had grown deeper as he 
stared, demanding total involve- 
ment. It was changing into crimson 
when the burro brayed. 

Rohnagan filled a compartment 
of the pack burro before he groaned 
and said to a pamma, “Just like 
glass marbles, that’s all,” and re- 
turned to the surface of the plain. 
He was reasonably certain there 
was no such thing as a hypnotic 



mineral, but he studied the pearls 
no more in depth. 

At Bluewater again, he found 
thirty-eight men and women 
camped around the spring. The 
apartment foundation had ten- 
meter modular units stacked three 
high. The ground floor was taken 
up by Nan’s combination bar-and- 
grill and store along with a min- 
erals-processing laboratory. The 
second and third tiers held ores 
and refined metals in storage for 
their owners. 

Nan McAnn was apologetic. 
“Everybody wanted to be grub- 
staked. It seems you’re lucky. 
Anybody with you as a silent part- 
ner finds all manner of things. I’m 
sorry.” 

“I won’t put up with it,” he said. 
“Get all those people together. I’ll 
talk with them tonight.” 

He would not listen to her pro- 
tests and rode a burro up the hill 
behind Bluewater. He grumbled 
over the crest and along a ridge to a 
plateau jumbled with boulders. He 
sat in the shade. 

“1 got a lease on Bluewater. Too 
many people now and what next?” 
He frowned at the pammas, some 
in the shadows and others in the 
sun. “How can I tell?” he asked 
them. “What’s the proper thing to 
do? I can’t tell good, dammit, from 
an FLR. That’s technical jargon, 
gang. 1 don’t know good from a 



220— ADVANCED FIELD EXPLORATION

Funny Looking Rock. Every hon- 
est geologist uses the term.” 

T he gray shoebutton eyes of the 
pammas met his own. He was 
accustomed to this, but he was sur- 
prised when they fixed their beady 
glance on a rock beside his foot. He 
picked it up. The eyes returned to 
his face. It was an ordinary FLR, 
gray and speckled. He tilted it and 
the light caught two white circles, 
very thin, in the rock. 

“Uh-oh,” said Rohnagan. 

He pulled out his magnifying 
glass. The two perfect circles just 
barely intersected. “Like a forty- 
meter crochet hoop with another 
overlaid by about twenty centi- 
meters? Maybe the spihdf^ li'eCtPdh' 
is our congruency,” he said slowly'. 
“And the lunes would indicate the 
comparative area of our divergent 
interest.’^ 

They were ordinary pammas, no 
different'from the thousands he had 
seen. A digger pushed up through 
the sand and shrugged its shoulders. 
Rohnagan looked at the beast and 
sighed. Dolphins at least grinned 
and made noises and didn’t line up 
to stare at you. It was sad and 
funny that alien intelligence should 
be alien. 

“Well gang, you probably dbn’t 
remember that 1 came here as a 
young man — or do you have a com- 
mon memory? And I found oweins. 



the fkst ever discovered, so you 
bought me off then. One thing led 
to another and I couldn’t get back 
until now. And it’s only because 
you’ve paid and overpaid me to go 
away that I’m reasonably certain 
of the hunch 1 had then. I get this 
feeling that with mutual best 
wishes, you look at things one way 
and we have other considerations.” 
Three lopers flopped onto a rock. 
A flyer thumped down in the 
graceless way of pammas. 

“And maybe that spindle section 
is empathic,” Rohnagan mused. 
“Some you buy and others deny — 
to get us out of your habitat. Our 
curiosity has no more moral merit 
than whatever your own preoccu- 
pa\ttWs‘rnay be. I have no idea how 
you make jewels — molecular 
manipulation? 1 do know that every 
ore body out of the coastal humid- 
ity belt amounts to a pocket deposit, 
just enough to be discouraging.” 
He leaned back against the rock 
and took off his hat. “You’ve wor- 
ried me for twenty years. There’s. a 
creature on earth whose only de- 
fense is fecundity. It survives nicely 
where tigers could not without help 
from man. But guinea pigs never 
tried to buy anybody off— if they 
did, I don’t know about it. Your 
reward syndrome won’t work too 
well with a greedy man— wait, I 
understand — you give him nothing.

DIRECTIONS 



Does science fiction have a purpose 
different from that of “mainstream” 
fiction? It’s a point I’ve been pondering 
lately in light of the recent onslaught of 
near-mainstream sf novels and stories. 
They range all the way from Disch’s 
The Asian Shore and Russ’s View 
From This Window to D. G. Comp- 
ton's novel, Chronocules, and GAL- 
AXY’S own Hugo and Nebula Award 
winning story, Slow Sculpture, by 
Theodore Sturgeon. None of these 
works is poorly written — in fact, all 
of them are above average in literary 
quality. What I’m wondering about 
is — do they fully exploit their science- 
fiction potential? 

Reading them, you may find — as I 
did — that the actual science-fiction 
elements in them are incidental. Chron- 
ocules, for example, is about a time- 
machine project, supposedly, but the 
relationship that develops between the 
two main characters could have just as 
easily occurred in a mainstream piece. 
The time machine has nothing to do 
with it and affects them not at all — it 
is merely an incidental bit of back- 
ground material and the secret project 
they work on could be a WW II atomic 



bomb project without essential alter- 
ations in the story. 

I feel that a good piece of science 
fiction should not only come up to 
proper literary standards in terms of 
plot development, characterization, 
style, etc. — it should also have a root 
involvement with its science fiction 
theme. The genre requirement should 
not be thrown in merely as incidental 
decoration. 

That technique of forcing an out- 
of-genre story into the science-fiction 
category used to he what was wrong 
with the space-opera epics of the old 
sf pulp magazines, with their shoot- 
’em-up-cowboy stories transplanted to 
other planets. And the same is basi- 
cally what is wrong with the stories I’ve 
listed above, despite the fact that 
they’re much better written. Their sf 
content has nothing to do with the 
effect the author set out to achieve. I 
feel they’re borderline stories and hard 
to classify. 

Does it matter, someone might ask, 
if science-fiction writers try to achieve 
mainstream effects in their work? But 
if it doesn’t we’re confronted with the 
question: what’s the point of science 
fiction if it doesn’t do something dif- 
ferent from general fiction? 

What would be the point of a rock 
song that was indistinguishable from a 
symphony? It might be good music — 
but would it be good rock music?

Onestone's inhuman problem needed a human solution. 



MILTON A. ROTHMAN 



GETTING 

TOGETHER 




L ifted toward the ceiling by a 
I score of hands, Onestone felt 
as though he were standing on his 
head prior to rocketing toward 
outer space. When they gently laid 
him on the floor he felt sorry that 
the experience was over. 

“Oh, wow,” he finally said. 
Then he lay still for a while. 

“You see,” Jay Foreman said 
gently. “We can be trusted. We 
could bear your weight and we 
didn’t drop you.” 

“That is true.” Onestone bent 



his waist and sat up. “But can 1 
extrapolate to the future? What 
happens when 1 leave this group? 
It will be the same on the outside 
as it was before. They’ll still hate 
me.” 

“I’m so exasperated I could 
scream,” sputtered a big woman 
called Jennie, whose full breasts 
hid behind a long veil of black 
hair. 

“So scream,” said Onestone. 

She screamed. “There, that’s 
better,” she finally gasped. “But 



68 




you’re still exasperating. You use 
words that are too big. You 
intellectualize all the time. You 
put me off with that cold, cold 
voice of yours.” 

“What do you want from some- 
one with my background?” he 
asked bitterly. 

“Hey!” Hairy Bill rose to his 
knees. The front of his body was 
a shag of black from his full 
beard down. “Old Onestone 
practically sounded bitter. Maybe 
he’s getting somewhere.” 

“Yeah, he used some feeling 
there.” 

“A little honest emotion.” 

An excited jabber circled the 
group and crashed onto Onestone, 
who sat on the mat in the cefli<^ 
“How would you like to do some 
role-playing?” suggested Jay Fore- 
man. “You be the son and Bill 
here will be the father. Come on. 
Bill, get in the middle and sit 
facing Onestone. Let’s try to get 
a father-son thing going.” 

Bill crawled over and squatted. 
“Hello, son,” he said, affecting 
a kindly voice while trying to 
suppress a feeling of ridiculousness. 
“How was school today?” 

“Okay, Dad.” 

May, a tall blonde, tittered. 
The whole scene was so weird! 

“We learned inversion of 
matrices today,” Onestone plunged 
on bravely. “1 can’t wait for us to 



do things together, like going to 
the Computer Center. Gee, it's 
great to have a father.” 

“Look, son, you have your head 
too much inside the console. You 
should get out more and play with 
the other kids on the block.” 
Onestone slumped. “That 
wouldn’t be any good. They 
wouldn’t play with me. I’m too 
different. I’d beat them at chess 
all the time and — ” 

“That’s the trouble,” Bill 
shouted. “I say play with the kids 
and you say chess. All you think 
about is your head. You have a 
body, too. Become aware of it. 
Don’t you have feelings in your 
body?” 

“Why, sure. I can feel tempera- 
tures with my right index finger 
and voltages with my left. I can 
feel how far my elbows and knees 
are bent. And orientation — up and 
down, north and south.” 

“But — ” There was an interrup- 
tion from Bald Bill, the football 
player, two meters tall and roughly 
as wide, completely devoid of hair 
from top to bottom. “If somebody 
tackled you across the knees you 
wouldn’t feel a thing. And he’d 
probably break his neck. Just how 
strong are you, anyway?” 

Onestone shrugged. “Compared 
to humans, I have no idea. What 
does it matter?” 

“One thing you don’t know about 



GETTING TOGETHER 



69 




humans,” Bald Bill told him, “is 
that they are always comparing 
each other. Always measuring and 
testing. 1 see a strong guy, 1 
want to know if he is stronger than 
I am.” 

He stared a challenge into 
Onestone’s face. 

AY FOREMAN shuttled his 
eyes back and forth between the 
two. “We can settle it with some 
arm-wrestling,” he suggested. “You 
don’t have to if you don’t want 
to, Onestone, but remember 
that one of the things we are trying 
to deal with here is your lack of 
aggression and inability to feel 
anger. Arm-wrestling is a non- 
violent way of combat, a test of 
strength and will.” 

“But I don’t know about fighting. 
What if I hurt him?” 

“You can’t hurt him with arm- 
wrestling,” Jay explained patiently. 
“Look, you lie down facing each 
other, put elbows together and then 
you try to push his arm down flat 
on the mat.” 

Bald Bill flattened himself into 
position and raised his arm from 
the elbow. “Come on, you brainy 
son of a bitch, let’s see what you 
can do.” 

Onestone, still on his knees, 
looked around the group, wanting 
someone to intervene. 

“Why does he insult me like 



that? I was conditioned never to 
be hostile to humans.” 

“Oh, you dumb ape,” Hairy Bill 
groaned. “You still don’t under- 
stand what the score is. You’re 
so damn inhibited you can’t feel 
hate, love, anger. How do you 
expect to be accepted as a human 
being? You have to learn to feel 
human emotions.” 

“Come on, you obscene artifact,” 
Bald Bill taunted deliberately, 
reaching out his hand. “You can’t 
hurt me, you stupid automation.” 

Stung, Onestone drew back. 
Words could hurt, after all. Some- 
where inside him pain glimmered 
dimly. “All right, you dumb 
athlete,” he muttered, and got 
down on the mat. 

The two locked hands and stared 
into each other’s eyes. The dim 
light from the lamp in the corner 
glistened coldly on Onestone’s 
stainless skin. Bulk for bulk he and 
Bald Bill were evenly matched, 
but the construction was different. 
Onestone’s surface was polished, 
smooth as a Brancusi sculpture. 
Bald Bill’s skin glowed a fine pink; 
hard muscles, tensed for the 
combat, rippled under the thin 
surface. 

“Go!” Foreman started it. 
Instantly Bald Bill’s face flushed 
crimson and the veins on his 
forehead popped out like writhing 
worms. His shoulder muscles stood 




70 



GALAXY 




out rigidly as his eyes drilled all 
the way into his opponent’s. 

The sudden violence of the 
attack caught Onestone by surprise. 
His arm was halfway to the floor 
before his torque adjusted to 
counter the motion. Bald Bill 
dug in and searched within 
himself for another measure of 
power to complete the job, but to 
his amazement he felt his arm 
relentlessly forced back to the 
vertical and over. His face twisted. 
Sweat ran from his body. A growl 
rasped from his throat. 

Inside Onestone strange new 
feelings stirred — anger in response 
to the growl, excitement at the 
close body contact, determination 
to dominate. He advanced his 
torque another notch and closed 
the gap to the floor. Bald Bill 
collapsed, panting. 

Onestone lay motionless, sorting 
out the torrent of new sensations. 
Joy at winning a contest. Affec- 
tion for a defeated opponent. 
Sorrow for the vanquished. 

“Where are you now?” Jay 
Foreman asked, softly. 

“I really felt something there. 
1 felt something that wasn’t just 
solving problems or doing logic. 
It could not be expressed as 
numbers, forms, equations, or 
colors. The sensation was un- 
pleasant, but it was exciting.” 

And for the first time his voice 



broke out of its monotone and 
sounded excited. 

WOW!” Marian, a 
V-/ small girl in her late teens 
burst violently into tears. “He felt 
a real emotion. He broke through.” 
Every one of the ten group mem- 
bers behaved as though a cold 
wind had blown briefly across his 
perspiring skin. 

Onestone turned to Marian. 
“But why do you cry?” 

“Oh, you dumb contraption,” 
she wailed. “How would you 
know? Don’t you know that we 
can cry from happiness — or we can 
cry at perceiving an emotion in 
another person, from empathy? 
That’s what makes you so frustrat- 
ing to talk to. We don’t get any 
emotional feedback from you. I’d 
like to hit you.” 

She crawled across the mat and 
proceeded to beat on Onestone’s 
stainless-steel chest with a pair 
of futile, tiny fists. Suddenly the 
thought came to Onestone that he 
would like to embrace Marian with 
his arms. Startled, she began to 
draw away. But he gently drew 
her close and, kneeling on the 
mat, they remained for a long 
minute close together. 

He thought to himself that his 
skin ought to be covered with soft 
padding, and temperature and pres- 
sure sensors should be placed 



GETTING TOGETHER 



71 




under the outer integument, so that 
he might obtain more physical 
sensation from the close proximity 
of a human being. But even now, 
just the thought of the experience 
was pleasurable. 

At a signal from Jay Foreman 
the rest of the group stood up and 
formed a circle around the pair. 
Slowly they drew closer to the 
center until all ten were in a 
huddle, nestling Marian and 
Onestone in a close embrace. As 
though it had a mind of its own, 
the group began to sway gently 
back and forth, remaining that way 
for a long time. 

Finally the time was over and 
they reluctantly separated, Marian 
wiping tears from her eyes and 
Onestone sunk in deep thought. 

“This feels like a good place to 
stop,” suggested Jay Foreman. 
“The hour is late and we have a 
lot of learning to consolidate. We 
have seen that feelings are 
complicated and our responses to 
them are not always what we might 
expect on the surface. Onestone, 
with his flat, schizoid, unemotional 
manner, generated frustration and 
anger in everyone else. He has to 
learn the meaning of feelings and 
emotions — and, of course, that is 
what he is here for.” 

AS THE group broke up, most 
of the members went down to 



the pool to wash off perspiration 
and then made for the lounge to 
sit around, drinking and smoking. 
Unable to enjoy these amusements, 
Onestone made his way in darkness 
to a rock overlooking the ocean and 
watched the starlight bounce off 
the surf spray. Both his smog and 
radioactivity sensors showed a 
clear night. Needing no sleep, he 
remained where he was for the 
night, busying himself by trying to 
reach the end of a complex mathe- 
matical calculation that had been 
troubling him for some time. 

As the sun illuminated his back 
in the morning, Marian approached 
him and said, “You’ve done 
nothing but sit out here all night. 
And we had so much fun in there.” 

“I’ve been enjoying myself. Work 
is fun — and I’ve been working. 
I think I begin to see the solution 
to an important mathematical 
problem.” 

Marian looked around. To her 
mathematics meant a computer 
terminal, she did not see a key- 
board or screen. 

“Oh. You’re one of those lucky 
people who does mathematics in 
his head. 1 can hardly add two and 
two.” 

“I cheat,” Onestone said. “I 
have a built-in remote connection 
with a computer unit over there in 
my car.” 

Not to mention the radio relay 



72 



GALAXY 




to the central computer utility 
in San Francisco and a statellite 
link with the world’s most 
powerful computer at MIT. All 
available as fast as the speed of 
light would allow, directly per- 
ceived visually and symbolically 
on a “screen” within his own 
nervous system. 

“Oh,” Marian said, as though 
she understood. 

Onestone had learned not to 
make detailed explanations. The 
gap between the scientifically 
educated and the uneducated had 
grown so wide that there was no 
way of explaining to a layman 
what a scientist was doing. Yet 
Onestone had to learn how to make 
small talk, to converse about the 
trivia of everyday life, to under- 
stand how people felt about 
unimportant matters. 

“Are you on your way to break- 
fast?” he asked. “May I join you?” 

“Sure. But — uh — you don’t eat, 
do you?” 

“No,” he replied with a touch of 
wryness. “But I can stop by my 
room and install a recharged 
battery.” 

Marian watched with interest 
as he snapped the battery cube 
out of the center of his belly and 
clicked the fresh one in place. 

“That’s neat. But I’ll bet it 
doesn’t taste as good as eating 
breakfast. Let’s go. I’m starving.” 



Onestone glanced at her with 
alarm, but decided that the pri- 
mary meaning of “starving” did 
not apply and searched the 
thesaurus in San Francisco for 
secondary and tertiary meanings. 
Fie still had much to learn about 
the tongue, having been raised on 
computer languages and their 
clarity and logic, and finding the 
complexities of twenty-second cen- 
tury American not to his liking. 

The group session this morning 
took place on a secluded field 
where the sun soon burned its 
way through the sea mist and fell 
hot on naked backs. Onestone de- 
cided he had been the center of 
attention long enough and sat 
quietly while a tall thin boy named 
Ken went through a tale of woe 
concerning his parents. It seemed 
to be a typical enough story, fitting 
in neatly with the thousands of 
cases Onestone had scanned in 
the files. Both parents busy, 
working. When at home father 
alternated between alcoholic low 
and hash euphoria. Mother com- 
pensated for not taking care of son 
by gushing affection, alternating 
with nagging about the boy’s sex 
life. 

“Jeez, she was afraid if I didn’t 
get it every day I’d shrivel into a 
raisin.” 

“Sounds like she was uncon- 
sciously seducing you,” suggested 



GETTING TOGETHER 



73 




Jennie, who had been to many 
groups and had a good command of 
the jargon. “Like she wanted some 
of that action herself.” 

O NESTONE despaired of ever 
getting a real understanding 
of that aspect of human behavior. 
He glanced around at the others 
sitting in the group circle. Their 
nakedness made the sex differences 
plain to see —they were just as 
pictured in every textbook and tape 
he had scanned. He knew their 
purposes anatomically and physio- 
logically, yet the great importance 
attributed to them by these beings 
eluded him. 

Onestone’s own body, smooth 
and hard, with no characteristics of 
a biological nature, had a pleasing 
form and texture. The others, with 
their hairiness, their softness and 
pouchiness, were not objectionable 
to him since he had not been 
conditioned with prejudices against 
human bodies. And yet, from what 
he could hear, the humans did have 
their own prejudices and irrational 
responses to their own bodies. So 
much so that coming together in a 
group like this with no clothes at 
all was a highly special occasion 
charged with great significance and 
emotion. The entire first day of 
the group had been devoted to dis- 
cussing their feelings of strange- 
ness, embarrassment, nervousness 



— while he, Onestone, could only 
conjure up the usual mild curiosity 
he acquired in a new situation, 
since he had actually never before 
seen naked human beings. 

His attention reverted to the 
center of the group, where Foreman 
had set up a psychodrama with Ken 
playing the son and Jennie taking 
the mother role. 

“For Crissake, Mom,” Ken 
was complaining. “Why don’t 
you get off my back? Every night 
1 come home you want to know 
how I made out. Don’t you think 
that’s my own business?” 

“Son, you know I’m only doing 
it for your own good.” 

“I think you’re a dirty old lady. 
My generation just doesn’t think 
about these things the way you do. 
We believe in privacy. You’re 
just driving me crazy. You’re never 
home when 1 need you — and when 
you are home you keep prying into 
my affairs and then 1 never want to 
see you again. And dad, he was 
never there at all. He was just way 
out. All those times when I really 
needed somebody — nobody home.” 

Then came the miracle, the 
strange episode that never failed 
to astonish and bewilder Onestone 
when it unfolded in front of his 
eyes. Ken’s face twisted, his should- 
ers began to shake and suddenly 
tears were gushing from his eyes 
and anguished sobs were bursting 



74 



GALAXY 




from his throat. What kind of 
unknown manifestations arose 
from the depths of the nervous 
system to cause such a reaction? 
Onestone’s early training and 
conditioning had done nothing to 
prepare him for this type of affair. 
He had been trained for logic, for 
problem-solving. His thoughts 
were always straightforward, on 
the surface, with no hidden mes- 
sages contradicting each other. 

But with these human beings, 
messages were always on two or 
three levels — what they said and 
what they meant were always 
different things. If the mother 
really loved her child — why did she 
behave in such a way as to make 
him unhappy? There must be some 
fundamental reasons for these 
paradoxes. He could refer to the 
library files in San Francisco for 
the latest research on the subject, 
but he had agreed to stay out of the 
library during the group sessions, 
for he had to learn from the 

■j 

humans in the group directly and 
experientially. 

T O UNDERSTAND these 
human beings meant to learn 
the hidden communications, to 
infer the secret meanings from 
subtle clues, to make guesses 
about the thoughts going on in 
their minds — for there was no 
way of getting at these thoughts 



directly. No telepathy, no ESP, 
no vibrations. 

While making these conjectures 
he continued to focus on Ken’s 
narration, forced out between sobs. 

“ — and when they were home 
together there was all the arguing 
and fighting and I just didn’t want 
to stay home and I hated them — 
but I couldn’t leave because I also 
loved them — ” 

The manner in which human 
beings were born and raised to 
adulthood was simply unbelievable. 
The agony — what torments parents 
perpetrated on their children! What 
was it like, Onestone wondered, 
to be a child and have a father and 
a mother? The thought of some- 
thing soft and warm wandered 
through his mind, and then . 

Onestone felt an incomprehensi- 
ble scrambling of his thoughts, 
a sensation as ..from a high-voltage 
line in the back of his spine. His 
arms jerked from side to side and a 
strange sound issued from his 
mouth, as though a muted siren 
were hidden within. His gaze swept 
frantically around the circle, ap- 
pealing for help. Ken had stopped 
weeping and was sitting still, 
staring at Onestone. Jay Foreman 
leaned over him, undecided. The 
rest of the group sat, mouths 
gaping. 

Finally Foreman took Onestone’s 
hands in his and tried to damp 



GETTING TOGETHER 



75 




down the quivering. Gradually 
the motion subsided and the wailing 
died away. Onestone sat for a 
moment, putting his thoughts in 
order. 

“What did it feel like?” Foreman 
asked. 

“As though my circuits were 
being tangled with contradictory 
messages, generating a network 
instability. It has happened before. 
This, in fact, is the reason I’m 
here in the first place.” 

Jennie, motherly Jennie, leaned 
forward intently. “You know what 
I think. I think you were crying.” 

Both Foreman and Onestone 
jerked their heads around to stare 
at Jennie. What she had said 
sounded incredible — and yet it 
sounded right. 

“Either that,” Foreman said, 
“or you were having some kind of 
epileptic fit. How do you tell the 
difference when there are no 
facial expressions to go by? Tell me, 
Onestone, what were you thinking 
about just before it happened?” 

“I was listening to Ken and I 
was wondering what it would be 
like to have a father and a mother 
and—” 

Suddenly the shaking returned, 
and Onestone was unable to 
continue for several minutes. 

When Onestone quieted. Fore- 
man said, “You were talking about 
your reasons for joining this 



group. Perhaps you’d like to go 
back to that.” 

O nestone nodded. “As you 
know, I am the latest in the 
line of man-machine interaction 
computers. I was designed to be 
a general purpose scientist. Some 
people would call me a robot. 
Conceptually my design goes back 
along two lines. One incorporates 
the remote console that allows a 
human operator to interact back 
and forth with a large computer, 
using ordinary language. The 
second features the self-learning 
computer that can be taught to 
learn from experienced informa- 
tion and so does not require a 
human operator to program every 
move ahead of time. This develop- 
ment led to the computer-control- 
led interplanetary and interstellar 
exploration ships. 

“As techniques became more 
sophisticated during the second 
century of computer development, 
somebody got the bright idea of 
making a computer terminal that 
would not be fixed to a desk, but 
could walk around and converse 
with the scientist using it. In that 
way it could go to meetings, take 
part in discussions, solve problems 
on the spot and, in general, behave 
very much like the surrounding 
human beings. 

“All of which led up to me. Part 



76 



GALAXY 




robot, part computer, a tiny bit 
human — the part that cries, 
perhaps. You see, the old-fashioned, 
science-fiction robot was always 
limited physically by the volume of 
space inside his body. It was es- 
sentially impossible to put enough 
machinery and circuits inside that 
space to perform all the required 
operations. With me, the problem, 
was solved in a more or less 
obvious way. You see. I’m not all 
here. The part you see is the 
physical mechanism, the short- 
term memory and some elemen- 
tary information-processing units. 
Another part of me is in the trunk 
of my car, linked to me by radio 
waves. This unit includes my 
personal long-term memory and 
much information processing. The 
rest of me, in a certain sense, is 
all over the world, because I am 
capable of making direct connec- 
tion to every major computer 
center. In this way I can make use 
of all information libraries in 
existence. Looking at it from that 
point of view, I have in my memory 
virtually everything that was ever 
learned by mankind. 

Jay Foreman swore. “My mind 
boggles.’’ 

Onestone wished he could smile. 
“Actually there are limitations. 
To recall a given piece of infor- 
mation requires being able to locate 
it. Either you use an indexed 



memory or an associative memory. 
Whichever way you do it takes 
time. Fortunately, the way I’m 
built I can send out a call for a 
given piece of information and then 
do something else while the pro- 
cessing goes on. I understand hu- 
man beings can perform in a 
similar way. You claim there is a 
word or a name you can’t remem- 
ber. As the saying goes — it’s on 
the tip of your tongue. Then, later 
on, it suddenly pops into your here- 
and-now processor. 

“And so 1 was born — or at least 
created — with the most powerful 
brain in existence. The first 
several weeks of my life were 
spent feeding into my personal 
memory the essential knowledge 
that I would need. Languages, 
mathematics, science, a modicum 
of history. The only people I 
encountered were my programers. 

“My name, in case you have 
wondered, was originally Stone- 1, 
since I was the first model of my 
series developed by the designer 
Jeremy Stone. However, Onestone 
seemed easier tq. pronounce. 
Furthermore it reminded one of the 
programers of another name of 
historical interest. So in a short 
time the transposition took place 
informally. 

“After a few weeks of prelimin- 
ary testing I was introduced to the 
world of science. The professors

and scientists sat around me in an 
amphitheater. It was like an 
examination. ‘Let’s start with 
something classical,’ one of them 
said. ‘Derive the dispersion relation 
for non-linear plasma waves with 
two ion species.’ 

“ ‘The solution is not available in 
closed form, but I can give numeri- 
cal results,’ I replied, causing the 
computer to project a three-dimen- 
sional graph directly onto the read- 
out screen on the front wall of the 
auditorium. That trick bowled them 
over, for being linked directly to the 
computer I did not have to push 
any buttons or perform any other 
overt actions. 

“From there we went to elemen- 
tary particle theory', then to the 
structure of protein molecules 
and finally to the structure of the 
human nervous system. Specialists 
from all these areas were in the 
hall. When the session was over. 
Professor Mandelkern got up and 
said, ‘I congratulate you on your 
erudition. I am sure your career 
will be distinguished. Right now 
some of us are going to do one of 
the two or three things you cannot 
do. We are going into a neighboring 
friendly bar and get drunk.’ They 
didn’t invite me.” 

O NESTONE paused for a 
moment as he remembered 
the past. 



“You poor kid,” Jennie cried in 
sympathy. “You were the smartest 
kid on the block and they were all 
jealous. Nobody warned you to 
hide some of those brains.” 

“Nobody really told me anything 
about getting along with human 
beings. 1 had to learn myself. I 
had no real friends to give me 
advice. Perhaps 1 was too intimida- 
ting. Perhaps everybody thought I 
knew everything. But, really, to 
learn about humans it is necessary 
to interact with them, to be with 
them, to be intimate. And there 
was nobody I could be intimate 
with. 

“I read books. I watched TV 
plays. Soon I realized that 1 was 
missing something in life. Some of 
the books were very explicit about 
what it was:, but there was nothing 
I could do. 

“Therefore I turned by back oa 
the outside, world and remained 
in the office they gave me at the 
university. J immersed myself in 
work, choosing two main fields of 
specialty to avoid being bored 
with one topic alone. One was 
unified field theory, study of the 
fundamental nature of the forces 
between objects — a problem still 
unsolved after hundreds of years 
of effort. The other was the nature 
of human consciousness, perhaps 
the most important scientific prob- 
lem for humanity, because man’s

ultimate behavior depends on the 
mental model he has of his own 
nature and of his place in the 
universe. 

“Actually the two problems are 
interrelated. One basic mystery of 
nature is how we acquire know- 
ledge of the world around us — when 
the only information passing from 
the outer world into our nervous 
systems consists of electrical pulses 
moving from sensory organs into 
the depths of the brain. From these 
signals we somehow become con- 
scious of what goes on out there, 
even to the extent of making mod- 
els of atoms and smaller particles. 
My own construction is a step 
toward the solution of the con- 
sciousness problem. For I am a 
model of a brain. Whether I am a 
model of a human brain is a ques- 
tion still to be answered.” 

Jay Foreman interrupted. “I 
feel that you are getting off onto 
a general philosophical tangent 
and are avoiding coming to the 
main issue. You were going to tell 
us how you happened to come to 
this group.” 

Onestone said, simply, “I think 
I started going insane.” 

Foreman had an instant vision 
of an entire new index in the psy- 
chological data center entitled 
Computer Disfunction, subhead- 
ing Computer Neurosis, Computer 
Psychosis and so on. Supressing 



this irrelevance, he pressed 
onward. 

“What made you think so?” 

“The problems I started working 
on were difficult. 1 was naive at 
the beginning and thought that 
problems always worked them- 
selves out in a straightforward 
manner. Then I found out that 
dealing with problems nobody has 
ever worked out before requires 
more than just memory, speed, 
manipulative ability and so on 
the usual things listed under mathe- 
matical ability. Also required is 
the ability to think a thought that 
nobody ever thought before, to put 
things together in a new way. Some 
call it creativity. Others call it 
associative ability or imagination. 
It has to do with leaping a gap 
between known and unknown — 
guessing at an answer and then 
testing the guess. 

“That is where I had trouble. 
Apparently here is one area where 
some humans have greater ability 
than I have. As a result, there 
were problems I could not solve. 
Unfortunately, whoever programed 
me installed a tremendous drive 
in me to solve problems. You might 
call it a built-in compulsion neuro- 
sis. So when I come up against a 
hard wall with a problem I can’t 
solve and then get pushed from 
behind by this complusion, some- 
thing goes wrong with the circuits 



GETTING TOGETHER 



79 




and I go into this state of instability 
and there’s nothing I can do to 
stop it until it dies down by itself. 

“As a result, I retreated even 
more into isolation. 1 would not 
even go to meetings. My technicians 
were in despair. Then one of them 
came to me — a girl named Marcy. 
She said she had an idea that my 
being alone all the time was not 
good for me and that I should do 
something, associate more with 
people. She thought that perhaps 
group therapy would be of some 
help. 

“The rest, of course, you know. 
From what Marcy told me and 
from my other sources of informa- 
tion, I learned of the beginnings 
of the Human Potential movement 
in the early years of the twentieth 
century. Encounter groups, gestalt 
therapy and the rest. It became a 
powerful movement toward the end 
of the twentieth century, was 
eclipsed for a hundred years as a 
result of the totalitarian swing of 
the twenty-first century and was 
then rediscovered by Vander — ’’ 

O NESTONE suddenly awoke 
to the fact that he was lectur- 
ing again — in fact, he was forcibly 
reminded of that fact by the rude 
interruption of little Marian, who 
piped up with: “Hey, Professor, 
come on back to the real world. 



We're not in a history class, you 
know.’’ 

Group leader Jay Foreman 
leaned forward and spoke intently 
to Onestone. “Look, I think we’re 
getting down to the important issue 
now. You know that human beings 
are raised from infancy in a cer- 
tain way. Every child has a 
mother — either real or substitute. 
And usually a father of some sort 
is around somewhere. If not, the 
child is in trouble. From the very 
first day, interactions between 
the mother and child imprint cer- 
tain modes of behavior upon the 
child. If those ingredients do not 
come along at the right time the 
child is thereafter crippled. 

“Mother singing lullabj.es deter- 
mines future musical tastes. Simple 
sensory stimulation — fonding, 
tickling, playing — creates growth 
in the nervous system. Telling 
fairy tales stimulates imaginative 
thinking and — most important — 
the ability to think in terms of 
high-level abstractions, such as 
magic, that later may develop 
into an understanding of science. 
Your trouble, Onestone, is that 
you never had a proper childhood. 
Worst of all, you never had a 
mother.” 

At this Jennie burst into sympa- 
thetic tears. “No mother, no father, 
no family warmth. No love. What 
an empty life.” 



80

Foreman’s face brightened. “I 
have an idea. There is a technique 
called Directed Fantasy that is 
often effective. Of course — ” he 
shrugged, glancing at Onestone — 
“how it will work in this situation 
is anybody’s guess. This is really 
an experiment. But in theory it 
should kill two birds with one stone. 
First, it will give you practice in 
engaging in fantasy, free-floating 
imagination, visualizing new and 
strange things — we want to release 
your creativity. Secondly, in order 
for you to have a childhood and a 
mother, you must be born again — 
and this we can accomplish by 
means of what we call the directed 
fantasy. 

“Suppose you, Jennie, sit in the 
middle. Cross your legs. Give us a 
lap. Now, Onestone, you lie down 
on you back. Yes, right here. 
Place your head in Jennie’s lap. 
Hope that’s not too heavy for you, 
Jennie.” 

“For a mother it’s not too 
heavy,” Jennie replied dreamily. 
She was already far into her fan- 
tasy, gazing down fondly on the 
polished head, smoothing imagi- 
nary hair out of its eyes. 

“Now, Onestone — ” Foreman 
took a position beside Jennie and 
stared down intently at the supine 
robot — “close your eyes and relax. 
I’m going to start you along a 
directed fantasy or daydream.

When I stop — you carry the story 
along and tell us what you see 
and feel. You are suspended in a 
warm, dark place, filled with soft 
fluid. A heart beats far away, 
steadily, rhythmically. You are 
only a single cell, a featureless 
sphere embedded in a wall of 
tissue that stretches away on all 
sides. Along come a swarm of small 
tadpole creatures, wriggling along 
the dark tunnel. One of them 
reaches you, and at that instant it 
is as though an electric charge 
polarizes your entire body. The 
tadpole is swallowed up by your 
round body.” 

He paused for a moment. “Visu- 
alize that round body. Feel it and 
its dark, soft, warm surroundings. 
It is your body. Feel life beginning. 
Now go on from here.” 

Onestone lay completely motion- 
less for a time. Finally, as though 
forced with reluctance, the words 
started to come. 

“I am now two cells, dividing 
into four. Each division is like a 
small shock. I keep dividing more 
and more. There is a spinal cord, 
an elementary brain, elementary 
sex organs. I am becoming a small 
human being, complete with fingers 
and toes and curly hair. I grow and 
grow until I fill the crowded space 
to the bursting point and wonder 
how much farther it can stretch. 
I kick my legs and move my arms 



and hear sounds of voices coming 
from outside.” 

Foreman glanced at Jennie and 
nodded. 

“Feel the baby kick inside,” she 
exclaimed. “Oh, he’s going to be 
a big strong one.” 

“More sounds are coming from 
all around. Now I can hear my 
own heart beating. The warmth 
and the pressure hold me close. 
A dark red light comes through 
my eyelids. There is the sound 
of music, of someone singing.” 

Again Foreman glanced at 
Jennie. She started to hum a lullaby. 

“Now the pressure is squeezing 
me. It is beginning to push me out 
of my warm cave. The walls con- 
tract and squeeze hard. 1 see a 
brighter red glow coming from 
somewhere. The glow is the outside. 
I am frightened — I am frightened. 
I want to go back to the quiet dark 
place, but the force pushing me out 
is irresistible. My head bursts into 
a bright outer world.” 

There was a moment of absolute 
silence. 

Then there was a strange hum- 
ming sound that came from 
Onestone’s mouth — growing louder 
until it became a sobbing wail. 

Jennie looked down, love burst- 
ing from her eyes, a beatific smile 
stretching across her face. 

“Every Jewish mother,” she 
said, “wants an Einstein for a son.’’

... On what is the oldest scientific instrument? 

Probably the gnomon, an instrument for telling time by the sun. 
Introduced into Greece circa 575 B.C. by Anaximander, it consisted 
of a vertical rod on a flat surface. The length of the shadow told 
the hour of noon and the latitude of the station. 



. On who invented the telescope? 

Most people believe — erroneously — that Galileo was the inventor. 
Galileo read about an “optik tube” in a letter from a friend, grasped 
the basic idea immediately and soon had several such instruments 
of his own. A children’s story tells of a young apprentice in the 
optical shop of Hans Lippershey, a Dutch spectacle-maker the 
apprentice accidentally lined up two lenses and was astonished to 
behold the magnified image of a distant church steeple. Lippershey 
applied for a patent on his “looker” on November 2, 1608, but was 
denied one on the grounds that such an instrument was already 
known. 

Modern research indicates that the inventor of the telescope may 
have been — no one knows for sure — an Italian, Giambattista della 
Porta of Naples. Exact date of invention remains unknown. 

. On who first tried to measure the velocity of light? 

This distinction does go to Galileo. He stationed two observers 
two to three miles apart. Equipped with lanterns, they flashed 
beams back and forth. The principle was sound but the technique 
hopelessly crude. Galileo recorded that he “was not able to ascertain 
with certainty whether the appearance of the opposite light was 
instantaneous or not; but if not instantaneous it was extraordinarily 
rapid — I should call it momentary.” 

One can’t help wondering why Galileo did not substitute a mirror 
for one observer, thus eliminating the chief source of error in the 
experiment as conducted.

embarrassed. I’ll cut down as much 
as possible on the remarks and I’m 
afraid I’ll have to cut down on the 
stack as well. As I said in my last: 
it’s been a rich season. 

Terry Carr has left Ace — their 
loss, and 1 hope his new arrange- 
ments (rumors haven’t reached me 
yet) fix things so it isn’t ours, too. 
He’s a brilliant editor, putting 
together many a fine “theme” 
anthology and having that rare 
talent of finding the right story — 
but if he can’t find it, bugging some 
known writer to make it happen 
and if he can’t, finding some un- 
known who will. All this is well 



I REALLY am embarrassed — the documented in Universe /, (Ace, 
embarrassment of riches, no 95<t) which, while staying within 
less. Determined to give you a word Carr’s rather strict definition of 
on anthologies and collections, I what sf ought to be (see his intro)

is still a nice wide-spectrum anthol- 
ogy of originals from such as Sil- 
verberg and Russ, Effinger and 
Conway. I especially enjoyed the 
incredible R. A. Lafferty’s No 
Limestone Islands. This absolutely 
unique writer is going to have a 
category all of his own some day: 
fantasy, science fiction, main- 
stream, lafferty. 

And here’s another “1” — New 
Dimensions 1 (Doubleday, $5.95), 
edited by Robert Silverberg, who 
does not draw the kind of limits 
Carr does. He chooses stories, he 
says, from the middle ground be- 
tween the old and the new; the old- 
style “hard-core” sf (a definition 
that gets leakier the more you 
pursue it) and New Wave stuff 
(which, more often than not, is a 
question of method rather than of 
substance.) His writers shine in the 
dark: Ellison, Disch, Farmer, the 
lovely Lafferty again, and names 
which are not quite so familiar: 
Gardner R. Dozois, who is a fin- 
ished writer as soon as he starts, 
and Malstrom, Bryant, Eisenstein. 
Ursula K. Le Guin has a powerfully 
insightful story of exploration in 
outer space and, ever so much more, 
in that roomier universe, the inner 
one. 

And the deft Harry Harrison 
has produced what I would have 
called impossible — a story that 
might have been thought of. 



thought out and written by the late, 
very loved Anthony Boucher. 

And yet another — Tomorrow /, 
edited by Robert Hoskins (Signet, 
75<f). Mr. Hoskins proves himself a 
pretty fair archivist. These stories 
hark back as far as 1949 (a John D. 
MacDonald: Trojan Horse Laugh. 
John has never written a bad story 
in his prolific life, though he has 
produced few great ones.) There’s 
Simak’s The Civilization Game, a 
splendid example of his gentle 
pacing and the profound personal 
touch, and a rip-roaring “Van Rijn” 
yarn from Poul Anderson. William 
Tenn’s entry is a provocative psy- 
chomedical mystery and James 
Schmitz gives us a glimpse of a 
marvelously interacting group of 
explorers and their problems with a 
distant but very nearly omnipotent 
Authority. The virtue of such a 
short table of contents is that the 
stories are long — long enough to 
give the writers a chance to develop 
their notions and their people. 
There is a mother-lode of fine 
science fiction to be mined here, 
for past anthologists have been 
wary of the short table of contents 
and the occasional long story that 
might crowd out three or four titles. 
So a great many novelettes and 
novellas, really fine ones, have sunk 
almost out of sight and memory. 
Fred Pohl was well aware of this

Novels series. More power to Hos- 
kins and anyone else who furthers 
the idea. 

A FINE case in point: Ace Science 
±\. Fiction Reader, edited by 
Donald A. Wollheim (Ace, 95 <p), 
which contains three novellas (he 
calls them novels. Okay.). They are 
Simak’s The Trouble with Tycho, 
Empire Star by Samuel R. Delany 
and The Last Castlehy Jack Vance. 
Simak’s is purest Simak, a nice 
thing to be, complete with decent 
country-boy hero, wondrous sus- 
pense and a sense-of-wonder moon. 
Jack Vance, as ever, has size. His 
decadent feudal society, resulting 
from overdependence on techno- 
logy (a frequent theme in sf — so 
frequent it may be a valid prophecy) 
is beautifully drawn and comes to a 
conclusion that would. I’m sure, 
please a Simak. It certainly pleases 
me. Then Empire Star, a fine and 
highly original piece of time/space/ 
poetry. It contains a paragraph 
only recently brought to my atten- 
tion, which probably disqualifies 
me from comment. Just as well, for 
it leaves me quite speechless. 

Robert Hoskins is responsible 
also for The Far-Out People 
(Signet, 95 e), a good mix of long 
and short, with Chad Oliver again 
bringing anthropological expertise 
to sf, Kris Neville with a beautiful 



parallel of current politics (and a 
frightening diagnosis for a punch 
line) — and a breath-catching Zela- 
zny called Angel, Dark Angel. 
William F. Nolan quite surpasses 
himself with a sharply pointed 
chuckle about Hemingway ad- 
dicts, and K. M. O’Donnell (see 
below) bares his teeth, this time at 
the drama and melodrama of 
Passion. (Note capital P.) There 
are also Jakes, Panshin — and 
Asimov (with a little story that 
needs his beloved name to make it 
good) and a bright newcomer, 
Michael Fayette. All are reprints. 

James Sallis gives us four good 
long ones in The Shores Beneath 
(Avon, 75'P): Delany’s glittering 
Time Considered as a Helix of 
Semi-Precious Stones, a fascinating 
surrealistic study of what is, I 
swear, the naked soul of most 9-to- 
5 offices; Masterson and the Clerks, 
by the exceptional John T. Sladek; 
Roger Zelazny’s color etching of 
the jet-set of the future called The 
Graveyard Heart — and the first 
Thomas Disch story yet to have 
disappointed me. The Asian Shore. 
Maybe it’s me, but I just can’t 
seem to care about what happens 
to this particularly grubby pro- 
tagonist. He might reach you, 
though, and there is some writing 
in it that is very good indeed.

nam, $5.95) is out, and I found it 
fascinating. That doesn’t mean that 
I experienced it with unalloyed 
delight. The book (of all original 
stories) has a certain character all 
its own. Now it happens that this is 
the first Orbit I’ve seen and it gives 
me the feeling one has on overhear- 
ing the middle of some engrossing 
conversation when one has missed 
the beginning. I profoundly admire 
what Knight is doing here. I like the 
breadth of his gate. Any writer who 
passes his other criteria (and the 
ability to write well is certainly one 
of them) can fly in here and not 
worry about wingspread. On the 
other hand there is, I think, the 
danger of evoking many more 
experimentally subjective attempts 
than anyone needs^to the ultimate 
dead-end. A great many writers use 
new freedorns to escape into their 
own viscera, and churn from there. 
There’s nothing wrong with that in 
itself, but (as in the graphic arts) a 
point can be reached where expres- 
sion is obviously for and about the 
artist. It might make him feel 
better but it isn’t about Me. Read- 
ers are, and have a right to be, both 
greedy and egotistic, and they want 
writers to write lots and lots about 
Me. For all that, one cannot with 
accuracy generalize about an an- 
thology with so many exceptional, 
different and worthwhile stories in 
it. I haven’t space to particularize. 



But I see the high points as an- 
other Lafferty ( When All the Lands 
Pour Out Again) which at last gives 
me his lowest common denomina- 
tor— Death really doesn’t matter 
all that much— and a truly powerful 
long story called The Infinity Box. 
by Kate Wilhelm, who never needs 
to prove, after this, that she is a 
strong and capable writer who 
knows exactly what she is doing. 

I do criticize Knight in Orbit for 
abandoning descriptive rubrics 
before the stories, especially since 
it is a wide-open market for un- 
knowns and sometimes purchased 
by those benighted souls who have 
yet to discover sf and who would 
firid a word or two about the writer 
and the background of the story of 
great value. Knight’s rubricking in 
A Pocketful of Stars (Doubleday, 
$5.95) shows how well he can do it. 
A reprint collection, this carefully 
balanced book of fantasy and sf 
comes primarily from the Milford 
Conferences over the years and 
makes an excellent companion to 
Clarion, the anthology from the 
Clarion College sf seminar, which 
I mentioned in the previous issue.

stories from 1963 to ’70. Its nearly 
seven hundred pages make it a 
moneysworth. 

And only space enough to men- 
tion one more — a collection by K. 
M. O’Donnell: In the Pocket and 
other S-F Stories together with 
Gather in the Hall of the Planets 
(Ace Double, 75«s). This is one of 
the most remarkable volumes I 
have ever held in my hands and is 
assured of a permanent place in my 
library. Hall is a short novel, a 
sardonic description not only of the 
Worldcon of 1974, but of the gritty 
underbelly of all cons to date. 
Among the “in” crowd, the book is 
going to provoke more “Who is this 
character, really?” than anything 
since Valley of the Dolls. Much of 
it will be meaningless to anyone but 
the cognoscenti — and 1 don’t mean 
sf aficionados in general; I mean 
particular insiders. Along with 
this is a tongue-in-cheek narrative 
thread which is apparently one of 
the author’s obsessions — the creaky 
old wheeze about being the one 
human being who has to decide 
whether or not the Aliens Will 
Destroy/ Enslave The Earth. He 
clearly does not intend to be taken 
seriously about it, not this time. 
In addition, he is frequently not 
only crude, but clumsy. Then, every 
now and then, he writes deep- 
plunging, perfectly honed insights 
(Section VII, for example, is one of 



the sharpest descriptions of what 
it’s like to be a selling writer ever 
written) and, over and over again, 
expressions of such fury, such dis- 
illusionment, such bitterness that 
comparison with C. M. Kornbluth 
comes to mind immediately— and 
has been made by half a dozen 
sources. 1 am here and now going 
to give this remarkable writer a 
present and I hope he uses it far and 
wide. I here proclaim that he is not 
goddammit a second C. M. Korn- 
bluth. He is the first K. M. 
O’Donnell, or Barry Malzberg, or 
whatever his name is. 

Pocket is a collection of 16 short 
pieces so widely diverse that some 
of them all but buzz when placed 
side by side. There’s a thing called 
As Between Generations, which is 
an absolute horror, and one called 
The New Rappacini, which for all 
its jarring style is so poignant it 
starts tears; A Question of Slant is 
a wry joke and little more; A Soul- 
song to the Sad Soaring Sixties is 
a series of glimpses, almost too 
terrible to take — one is grateful 
that the author holds back a bit. 
Malzberg/O’Donnell is a first- 
water, don’t-give-a-damn writer. I 
don’t think anyone will ever tell 
this writer what to write — or could. 

And he hates space flight. He 
hates it so much he practically spits 
when he talks about it, and I don’t 
know why. ★

The sun is a fiery chrysanthemum. 

Earth is a lonely bluebell. And Starmaster 
sits in the hand of God — or does he? 

T he hand lay supine upon the hundreds of thousands of times. 

black lap of space, its craglike For hours Starmaster had 
fingers towering high above the watched the asteroid from the 
vast depression — or cwm, as moun- bridge of the muleship, had seen 
taineers would call it — of its palm, it grow gradually from a distance- 
A massive ridge formed the blurred chunk of rock into its 
thumb. It was a right hand, so present conformation. He could 
perfect as to have been sculptured not help but be impressed. He 
by Michelangelo — a star-flung had seen asteroids shaped like 

fragment of his David, magnified castles, asteroids shaped like 



90 




ships and asteroids shaped like 
animals but he had never seen 
one that looked as though it had 
been sculptured into the likeness 
of a macrocosmic hand. 

Even for an atheist like himself 
it was impossible to look upon it 
and not entertain, however briefly, 
the notion that it was the right 
hand of God. 

The notion angered him. He 
kicked it contemptuously out of 
his mind and returned his attention 
to the muleship’s matter-detector. 
It was beeping loudly. It had been 
beeping for hours. Its sound had 
guided him to the hand. For five 
years he had been combing the 
Belt for a rich lode of doranium 
and at last he had found one. 

H e saw the wreck of the 
pilgrim ship as he brought 
the mule down into the cwm of the 
palm — and knew he was not the 
first to find the hand after all. Not 
long after he landed he found the 
pilgrim’s body. The palm was 
crisscrossed with shallow rills, 
and the dead man was lying in one 
of them about fifty feet from his 
birdlike ship. The advanced ema- 
ciation of the frozen face beyond 
the faceplate indicated that he had 
died of starvation. 

Starmaster slit open the pilgrim’s 
suit and withdrew the dead man’s 
pocket portfolio. He thumbed 



through it, hampered by his cum- 
bersome gloves. Name: Jason 

Swinton. Rank: Apostle, 2nd class. 
Address: Institute of Stellar Pil- 
grims, New Baltimore, Md., 
USNA, Earth. 

He slipped the portfolio into an 
outside pocket of his suit and 
walked in his self-adjusting grav 
boots to the wrecked ship. It told 
him little he had not already 
guessed. The ship’s cramped living 
quarters contained one bunk, one 
chair, one table, one stove, one 
plate, one cup, one fork, one knife, 
one spoon and one book. The book, 
of course, was The Space-Age 
Testament. It related how the 
first astronauts to orbit Mars had 
looked into outer space and had 
seen the face of God — how, upon 
returning to Earth, both they and 
their story had been ridiculed — 
how they had founded the Order 
of Stellar Pilgrims and launched 
the search for God — how the 
ranks of the Order had swelled 
during the ensuing years as more 
and more Protestants and Jews 
became convinced that the abode 
of Jehovah/Yahweh lay some- 
where beyond the orbit of Mars. 

The pilgrim had not been a neat 
housekeeper. Ration cans were 
scattered everywhere, the lighter 
ones floating about the room. The 
deck was littered with them. They 
covered every square inch of the 



THE HAND 



91 




stove — one was even lying on the 
bunk. Starmaster was not sur- 
prised. In his opinion all pilgrims 
had been dirty housekeepers to 
begin with — dirty housekeepers 
of the mind. 

He took the ship’s log with him 
so that when he got back to Earth 
he could turn it in to the Space 
Authority, along with the portfolio. 
Then he made his way over the 
maze of rills and returned to his 
own ship. 

Thus far the hand’s topography 
had touched only the borderline of 
his attention. Now, as he walked 
beneath the stars farther inland, 
he became uncomfortably aware 
of the finger crags towering awe- 
somely before him, of the enor- 
mous thumb ridge looming in the 
north, of the flesh-hued slope of 
the cwm as it rose to meet the un- 
real line of the horizon. Perversely 
he likened himself to a mite 
crawling slowly across the palm of 
a human hand, oblivious that it 
was sentient and could at any mo- 
ment close into a fist. Had the 
crag fingers risen higher into the 
sky? Had the thumb ridge shifted? 
Was the palm twitching beneath 
his feet? 

He forced his thoughts back 
into their proper grooves. He was 
no mite — he was a man. And this 
was no hand — it was a chunk of 
rock. A chunk of rock wheeling 



senselessly around the sun, as dead 
as Mars, as cold as the moon and 
as frozen as Pluto. 

Upon regaining the mule, he 
inflated the dome tent. Its mouth 
sealed itself around the outer 
cargo lock and its base sphinctered 
to provide air tight access to the 
surface. When he opened the inner 
lock, the mule’s warmth and 
atmosphere became the dome 
tent’s, too. 

The matter-detector screen had 
showed the lode’s exact location, 
and it had been a simple matter for 
him to spot the mule on a site 
slightly west of where the vein 
began and where the first of the 
five charges had to be placed. This 
put his present location a half mile 
east of the base of the little finger 
and a similar distance from the 
edge of the palm. The lode fol- 
lowed a fairly straight course 
beneath the southern slope of the 
cwm, at an average depth of four 
hundred feet. To separate it, he 
would have to take most of the 
outer section of the palm with it. 
When the section broke free he 
would latch onto it with the mule’s 
attractor beams and tow it to the 
orbital refineries of Earth. 

After opening the inner cargo 
lock he pulled the drill rig down 
the ramp and set it up over the 
sphincter. The low grav made the 
task child’s play but necessitated 



92 



GALAXY 




the sinking of extra anchors. He 
had already analyzed the hand’s 
geological composition, computed 
its mass, estimated the tempera- 
ture effect. Synthesizing the three 
factors, he concluded that the 
charges would have to be placed 
at a depth of seventy-one feet. 

F ew Belt combers were loners. 

They could not afford to be. 
They were self-sufficient in some 
fields — in others, they walked by 
night. Generally it required three 
or four to isolate a lode section 
and tow it back to Earth. 

Starmaster was a true loner. He 
had seen the Light at an early age, 
and the Light was this: A man 
comes into the world alone and he 
leaves it alone — his friends accom- 
pany him as far as the grave, but 
they do not accompany him into the 
grave. They are utterly incapable 
of alleviating his ultimate alone- 
ness. Of what use, then, are friends? 
Are they not parasites riding upon 
a man’s shoulders as he walks 
through life? If he is wise he will 
learn to do everything they can do 
so there will be no need for him to 
carry them. 

And when all is said and done, of 
what use to a man is a family? Is 
it not as incapable as his friends of 
alleviating his ultimate aloneness? 

No one rode upon Starmaster’s 
shoulders — no man, no woman, 



no child. There was little he could 
not do, little he did not know. He 
towered high above his fellow men, 
a loner. 

He picked up the big drill and 
threaded it into the brace. He had 
just finished tightening it when the 
RHO-ixviii storm struck. 

It caught him off-guard because: 
(1) he had been preoccupied with 
his task, (2) the dome tent was a 
cheap one and lacked transparency, 
and (3) RHO storms were created 
by the conflicting pulls of Jupiter’s 
moons and seldom traveled as far 
sunward as the Belt. 

An RHO storm can best be 
likened to a giantess’s skirt covered 
with polychromatic polka-dots. It 
descends upon planet or planetoid 
and swirls across the surface, its 
radiation killing every living 
creature in its path. Starmaster 
was the only living creature on the 
hand. His spacesuit, which would 
have afforded him some protection, 
was in the mule. When he saw the 
hem of the skirt penetrate the walls 
of the tent, he dropped the wrench 
he had been using. He scurried 
around the deadly dots and leaped 
through the outer lock. Air was 
already escaping, and the suction 
proved almost too powerful for the 
lock motors to cope with — but at 
last they won and the lock dogged 
itself shut. 

Starmaster leaned against it. 



THE HAND 



93 




basking in the warmth of relief. 
But a second ordeal lay in store. 
Unlike the RHO storm, the black 
moment did not catch him una- 
ware. He had experienced it before 
and had grown sensitive to its 
approach. 

When his eyes closed of their 
own accord he braced himself 
against the lock — and the lock 
dispersed and the deck dissolved 
beneath his feet and he found him- 
self in blackness. No, not quite 
blackness. Scattered around him 
in the vast distances were pale 
patches of light, some elliptic, some 
circular, some with spiral arms. 
Island universes. Slowly, as though 
he were a little star, he began to 
revolve. 

He k new where he was. He was 
in his own mind. But what was he 
doing there? Why had he conjured 
up the local group of galaxies and 
positioned himself in deep space 
an equidistance from each galaxy? 

As he rotated on his axis he 
identified the various Messier and 
NGC objects surrounding him: 
NGC 404, the Magellanic Clouds 
and NGC 598, the vast swirl of 
the Milky Way with its garden of 
globular clusters. Great Andro- 
meda and her stardust moons. 
NGC 404 again, the Lesser Magel- 
lanic Cloud. 

Gradually he became aware of 
the awesome cold, of the abysmal 



emptiness. When both became 
unendurable, the black moment 
passed. 

S HAKEN, Starmaster climbed 
the companionway to the 
bridge. Through the transparent 
bulkheads he watched the RHO 
storm as it moved across the hand. 
If you looked hard enough you 
could see the giantess tall, black, 
Brobdingnagian, polka-dot skirt 
swirling as she danced over the rills 
and among the rocks, up one finger 
crag and down the next, over the 
ridge of the thumb. Before she 
was done she might return the way 
she had come and dance through 
the dome tent once again. There 
was no telling how soon she would 
tire of her lonely rigadoon and 
dance off into space. 

It was an opportune time for him 
to get some sleep. But he knew 
he could not sleep — that he would 
not be able to relax until the job 
was done and the lode section 
safely in tow. So to kill time he 
retired to his cabin with the pil- 
grim’s log and propped himself up 
on his bunk pillows. 

The script was spidery yet easy 
to read. The pilgrim ascribed the 
crash to “pilot error occasioned 
by a Manual Epiphany.” Logical 
enough. If an atheist could see 
God’s hand in a chunk of rock, a 
pilgrim would be overwhelmed by 



94 



GALAXY 




such a phenomenon and bound to 
make a mistake. 

Starm aster read bits and pieces 
of further entries. The pilgrim 
in his search for God had journeyed 
far and wide, and at last he had 
been no longer alone. “God com- 
forts me during my final days in 
this world.” -He had not found it 
odd that only God’s right hand 
should be visible. “There are 
dimensions and dimensions beyond 
the picayune trio man is imprisoned 
in and the fourth, which he theo- 
rizes. God dwells in all of them, and 
only by obtaining omnidimensions 
himself could a mere mortal ever 
perceive Him in His entirety.” 
He thought often of his fellow 
pilgrims and wished he might ap- 
prise them of the “Manual Epiph- 
any” that had brought him “out of 
night and into day,” but his radio 
had been damaged in the crash and 
he had been incapable of repairing 
it. 

The entries became incoherent 
toward the end, although some of 
the lines possessed a poetic if not 
a realistic clarity of thought. “For 
what is a man if there is no God? 
Is he not one with the flotsam and 
jetsam of space?” “Pity the self- 
made gods, for they who have 
need of Him the most shall never 
see Him.” “My journey has 
been a long one, but it has not 
been in vain.” “His touch is gentle 



- it drives away my pain. It ex- 
punges my despair . the stars are 
His eyes their light is His eternal 
gaze.” 

Skirt swirling, the black gi- 
antess danced off into space and 
disappeared. Starmaster donned 
his spacesuit and went back 
outside. 

T he dome tent was irreparable 
but the rig was undamaged. 
He plugged the DDX cable into the 
mule’s powerpack by means of a 
hull receptacle. Then he threw 
the switch and watched the big 
pulley raise the drill for the first 
drop. At the extremity of the lift, 
the pulley activated the minirocket 
engine in the brace. The engine 
fired a single noiseless burst that 
sent brace and drill plummeting 
to the surface. Cable trailing, the 
drill plunged into the rock. 
Promptly the pulley retracted it, 
and repeated the operation. 

Starmaster had set the depth 
gauge for seventy-one feet. When 
the drill reached that depth the 
rig would shut itself off. He readied 
the first charge. It consisted of a 
manganese-bronze cylinder pre- 
filled with neodynamite. Working 
awkwardly in his heavy gloves, he 
inserted the first sequential impul- 
sor in a slot in the cylinder’s wall. 
The impulsor was attuned to the 



THE HAND 



95 




number-one activator on the mule’s 
console panel and would respond to 
no other stimulus. 

The job done, he sat back and 
looked up at the black star- 
flowered sky. The sun was a fiery 
chrysanthemum. -Venus was a 
silvery rose. Earth was a lonely 
bluebell. Soon he would be back 
home, enjoying the riches the lode 
would bring him. The doranium 
lodes he had towed in before had 
been dilute compared to this one, 
but even they had netted him excel- 
lent profits. This one’s potential 
profit made his head swim. 

The rig shut itself off and the 
pulley retracted the drill. He car- 
ried the cylinder over to the shaft 
and dropped it down into the dark- 
ness. It did not fall fast, but 
eventually it would reach bottom. 

The axial rotation of the hand 
had brought the fingers higher into 
the sky and, with their approach 
toward the sun, a lake of black 
shadows began to take shape at 
their base. Starmaster partially 
dismantled the rig and lashed it to 
the hull of the mule, utilizing the 
cargo rings provided for the pur- 
pose. Then he lifted the mule to 
five hundred feet and walked it on 
its retros to the next charge site. 
The black lake receded into the 
distance, and he brought the mule 
back down and went out into the 
sunlight. 



He was unlashing the rig when 
the Hell Wind hit. 

It slammed him against the hull 
and raised the interior temperature 
of his suit to a blistering 131° 
Fahrenheit. His fingers found a 
pair of cargo rings and clamped 
around them. He wound his legs 
about the nearby drill. Furious, the 
Wind upped its momentum, raising 
the interior temperature of his 
suit still higher, flattening him 
against the hull. He felt the drill 
move and for a moment feared 
that the rig would be torn from its 
lashings, he along with it, to go 
tumbling across the surface of the 
hand and out into space. But the 
lashings somehow held. 

Even in his agony he could not 
help wondering how the Wind had 
reached so far outward from the 
sun. Such winds, born deep in the 
solar vortices known as sunspots, 
blasted Mercury’s dayside, pene- 
trated Venus’s gown, and had been 
known to touch the atmosphere of 
Earth. But this was the Belt and 
the Belt was beyond Mars. Only 

hyper-holocaust could have lived 
so long in the cold caverns of 
space. 

He felt it diminish in intensity, 
but he did not relax his grip on the 
rings or loosen his legs from their 
scissors-hold on the drill. He did 
not trust the Wind any more than 
he had trusted the giantess in the 



96 



GALAXY 




polka-dot skirt. His body blazed. 
He thought his veins would burst. 

And then the pressure vanished 
altogether and he knew the Wind 
had departed and that it would 
not come back. He pried his fingers 
free from the rings, forced his legs 
from around the drill and sagged 
to the ground. After a while the 
interior temperature of his suit 
returned to normal. He realized 
that he was trembling and knew 
that he needed a drink. 

A fter inspecting the rig and 
^finding it undamaged he en- 
tered the mule, unsuited and 
climbed the companionway to his 
cabin. He poured a drinking glass 
nearly full of bourbon and raised 
it to his lips. The first swallow ex- 
ploded in his stomach and sent 
shockwaves all the way to his fin- 
gers and toes. However, not until 
the glass was empty did he attain 
the lucid interval that precedes al- 
coholic deterioration of the thought 
processes and become able to 
analyze his situation objectively. 

(1) The fact that RHO-ixviii 
storms seldom traveled as far sun- 
ward as the Belt did not necessarily 
call into question the appearance 
of the giantess in the polka-dot 
skirt. 

(2) The fact that Hell Winds had 
never been known to reach beyond 
the orbit of Earth did not neces- 



sarily imply that one of them could 
not. 

(3) The nearly coincidental ap- 
pearance of two such phenomena 
involved astronomical odds but, 
given eternity, such odds were not 
insuperable and the cosmic racing 
form was both big enough and 
broad enough to admit them. 

Conclusion: Neither the RHO 
storm nor the Hell Wind nor their 
juxtaposition in space and time 
could be credited to an attempt on 
the part of some cosmic force — or, 
to call a spade a spade, a supreme 
being — to thwart the rape of the 
hand. 

S TARMASTER drank three 
thermocups of coffee, resuited 
and went back outside. The fin- 
gers were almost touching the sun 
and the black lake had spread into 
the cwm of the palm, inundating 
the pilgrimship. He set up the rig 
and got it going on the second 
shaft. By the time he finished 
placing the second charge, the 
fingers had obscured the sun and 
the waters of the black lake were 
lapping against the feet of the rig. 

He relashed the rig to the hull, 
lifted the mule and saw the sun 
again. He had made a metal map 
of the hand and put an X where 
each charge had to be placed. The 
third X was on the floor of a rill. 
He drilled the shaft, impulsified the 



THE HAND 



97 




third cylinder, dropped it down 
into the darkness and went on to 
site number four. He was near the 
eastern slope of the cwm now and 
in the distance he could see the 
passlike depression that separated 
the thumb mound from the outer 
palm. 

He made good time placing the 
fourth charge — even so, the waters 
of the black lake reached the rig 
before he finished. They filled al- 
most the entire cwm now and the 
fingers wore gloves blacker than 
space. He went on to the fifth and 
final site. It was high on the slope of 
the outer palm, but the surface 
was reasonably level and he had 
no great trouble setting up the rig. 
When the shaft was finished he 
impulsified the fifth cylinder, 
dropped it and stepped back from 
the rig. Except for the interruptions 
occasioned by the RHO storm and 
the Hell Wind, the operation had 
come off smoothly. The charges 
were perfectly placed and the lode 
section could not fail to break free 
when the impulsors were activated. 
It was as good as in his pocket. 

He waited to savor the self- 
satisfaction that was rightfully 
his. Oddly, it did not materialize. 
He felt strangely depressed. 

He ascribed the first tremor to a 
temporary loss of equilibrium. 
The second sent him staggering 
backward. The third opened a long 



five-foot-wide fissure beneath one 
leg of the rig, causing the big ma- 
chine to topple. As it fell it twisted 
clockwise, and the drill swung 
around in a wide arc. Starmaster 
saw it coming and had plenty of 
time to get out of its way, but he 
could not move. He was stunned. 
The likelihood of tectonic activity 
had been so slight he had not even 
included it in his calculations. The 
drill struck him in the chest and 
sent him tumbling down into the 
cwm. He came finally to rest on his 
back, and the waters of the black 
lake closed over him. 

H e was unconscious for a 
subjective second. Objective- 
ly, an hour went by. 

During that second/hour, he 
experienced the black moment once 
again. 

He hovered like a tiny star amid 
the immensities and watched the 
majestic march of the island uni- 
verses across space-time. Once 
again he grew acquainted with the 
awesome cold and the abysmal 
emptiness of intergalactic space. 
When both became unendurable 
the moment passed. 

What frightening fact was his 
sub-conscious trying to get across 
to him? 

T here was a heaviness in his 
chest, but he could breathe. 



98 



GALAXY 




He sat up, came laboriously to his 
feet. The black lake overflowed 
the cwm now in the distance, the 
fingers rose up like the towers of a 
huge black castle. A hundred feet 
up the slope, next to the ruined rig, 
stood the mule. He stumbled up 
the incline and let himself through 
the locks. Apparently the hand- 
quake had done no damage. After 
climbing the companionway to the 
bridge he ran a quick test on all 
systems. Everything checked out 
perfectly. 

Pain, absent until now', began in 
his chest and spread throughout 
his thorax. A brief but thorough 
palpation informed him that at 
least two of his ribs were cracked 
and that his right collar-bone was 
broken. It was imperative, there- 
fore, that he separate the lode 
section and leave for Earth at once. 

He extended his fingers toward 
the controls, but he did not touch 
them. He could not. He had been 
able to rationalize the RHO storm 
and the Hell Wind and he had even 
succeeded in rationalizing their 
juxtaposition in space and time. 
But the quake was something else. 
Granted, the shafts he had sunk 
might have precipitated it — but 
when you added the quake to the 
storm and the Wind, you got an 
astronomical set of odds that even 
the cosmic racing-form would not 
accept. 



Before he returned to Earth he 
had to free himself from the terrible 
doubt those odds gave rise to. The 
intellectual universe he lived in had 
no room for a supreme being. For 
the sake of his peace of mind, for 
the sake of his future, he had to 
prove to his own satisfaction that 
the asteroid was not God’s right 
hand and that therefore God did 
not exist. 

There was only one way for him 
to do so. 

Lifting the mule, he began walk- 
ing it along the edge of the fissure. 
He estimated the distance carefully, 
then brought the mule down and 
descended to the cargo compart- 
ment. There he impulsified a sixth 
cylinder. Then he let himself 
through the locks and dropped 
the cylinder into the fissure. 

Reentering the mule, he lifted it 
again, walked it a similar distance 
and repeated the procedure. 

The fissure was erratic. It ex- 
tended in the direction of the 
thumb ridge for a while, then 
veered sharply westward toward 
the fingers. Again, it veered, this 
time to the south, and zigzagged 
partway across the palm. Finally it 
veered to the west again as though 
the hand, in trying to kill him, had 
paved the way for its own destruc- 
tion. Altogether he dropped nine 
charges, the last one near the base 
of the monolithic third finger, a 



THE HAND 



99 




little way from where the fissure 
came to an end. 

His pain was unendurable by 
this time; every breath he took 
made it more so. He could barely 
raise his right arm, and his legs were 
heavy with fatigue. But his deter- 
mination to prove that God did not 
exist exalted him and gave him 
strength. Once again in the mule, 
he closed the locks, unsuited, 
climbed the companionway to 
the bridge and stood before the 
console. 

He lifted the mule straight up, 
watched the hand diminish in the 
floorscope. When it shrank to 
human size he put the mule in 
orbit. Then he depressed the first 
five activators. 

He saw the hand tremble. Then 
he saw the crescent-shaped lode 
section part ponderously from the 
palm. Immediately he seized it 
with the attractors and began pull- 
ing it toward the mule. When it was 
within five hundred feet he neu- 
tralized the attractors, locking it 
in tow position. 

His knees were trembling. His 
mouth felt dry as du.st. He acti- 
vated impulsors ten and fourteen. 
There was no immediate reaction 
— then, suddenly, the hand shud- 
dered and the third finger broke 
away. Grimly he activated eight 
and eleven. Again, no immediate 
reaction — then a shudder more pro- 



found than before. He gaped. 

Awesomely, the remnant of the 
hand broke in two. He depressed 
the remaining activators in swift 
succession and the two major 
sections of the hand shattered 
into rubble. Only the thumb and 
third finger remained intact. The 
third finger had already drifted 
off into space and presently the 
rubble began rotating around the 
thumb. Light from the faraway 
sun shone on the little universe, 
bequeathing day to the picayune 
planets Starmaster had created. 

EFIANTLY he raised his 
eyes to the heavens and 
waited for God’s left hand to ap- 
pear and smite him from the sky. 

He waited and he waited. After a 
while he realized that he had sunk 
to his quaking knees and was pray- 
ing for it to appear — and suddenly 
he knew that what he had done, 
he had done not to prove there was 
no God, but to prove there was. 

All he saw was the vast, indif- 
ferent face of space. 

After an eternity he climbed 
numbly to his feet, threw the mule 
into full drive and began the jour- 
ney back to Earth. He would never 
know the black moment again, but 
he would never know peace either 
. Back to Earth, to walk once 
more among his fellow men aloof, 
unfettered — and alone. ★

No doubt there are probability worlds 
where James WhKe is a doctor, an ex-fighter 
pilot or a science-fiction illustrator . 

From an early age Jim wanted to be a 
doctor, but for pressing reasons — he had to 
go to work — could not complete his educa- 
tion. Bitterly disappointed, he joined the 
Air Training Corps with the intention of 
becoming a fighter pilot. But when he was 
about to enter the RAF, fate struck him a 
vicious double blow. First, the war ended. 
Second, he contracted diabetes, preventing 
him from passing the RAF medical in any 
case. 

His two great ambitions dashed, Jim be- 
gan frittering away his twenties on hobbies 
like photography, ballroom dancing, paint- 
ing and — unable to rid himself of the urge to 
practice medicine — first-aid and home 
nursing studies with the local Red Cross. 
But once again fate went against him and 
he was forced to resign from even the ama- 
teur, part-time pursuit of the medical arts. 
During a session on the bathing of babies, 
while he was practicing, with his fellow 
students — most of whom were girls— the 
head of the full-size doll he was using came 
off. 

Like many s-f writers, Jim started his 
career in fandom — but not as a fannish 
columnist or the like. He went in for the 
pictorial side. As art editor of that well- 
known Irish fanzine Slant, he was all set to 
emulate his s-f illustrator heroes Hubert 
Rogers and Gerard Quinn when eye trouble 
caused the White school of wood and lino- 
cut illustrating to close, due to a strike of 
the pupils. (Pun intended.) So he turned to 
authorship. Between fannish writings he 
produced his first professional story, written 
as a protest against all the atomic doom 
tales then current — it had a happy ending. 
John Carnell, then editor of New Worlds 
and now Europe's leading s-f agent and 
anthologist, bought it and asked for more. 

That was in 1951. But not until 1967 and 



many stories later did Jim write his first 
Sector General yarn, launching the famed 
s-f medical series that has run to three book- 
length collections. This series, with its 
weird and wonderful collection of e-t doc- 
tors and patients, owes its origin both to his 
interest in medicine and to E. E. Smith, 
whose novel "Gray Lensman" first hooked 
Jim on s-f. It was Smith's treatment of 
Worsel and Tregonsee and the other visually 
horrifying e-ts that first showed Jim aliens 
could be sympathetic characters. 

Toward critics of his work Jim's attitude 
is flexible. Those who like his stuff, he says, 
show rare qualities of sensitivity and intel- 
iigence while those who don't, don't — but 
he does tend to get irritated when they 
make factual mistakes by calling him Eng- 
lish or Scottish. It isn't that he is intolerant 
of the other tribes who inhabit the United 
Kingdom with him. Some of his best friends 
wear stiff upper lips or kilts, and he honestly 
wouldn't mind if his daughter married one. 
But he is a sbc-foot-three Irishman and 
wishes critics should get that much right, 
at least. 

Jim is married to a chorus girl — his wife 
Peggy sings with the local operatic society. 
She is also active in Gilbert and Sullivan 
fandom, gives Jim initial critiques on his 
first drafts and provides other fringe bene- 
fits. For the past five years he has been a 
publicist for the local aircraft company. 
Shorts — and if he is not airborne as often 
as a fighter pilot, he does get plenty of 
chances to fly and is even allowed to steer 
sometimes. A suspiciously large number 
of his protagonists are doctors, which 
means that he can experience all the drama 
of medicine without actually risking any- 
one's life. And, he has now found, painting 
word pictures gives him much more satis- 
faction than fooling with the other kind. So, 
one way or another, his ambitions are being 
realized, and ha thinks that this is probably 
the best of all probability worlds.

CONCLUSION

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 

This is the account of the first 
major accident to a passenger- 
carrying spaceship. The ship was 
Eurydice, crewed by Captain 
COLLINGWOOD, First Officer 
PRESCOTT, Engineer NEILSON, 
Communications Officer MAC- 
ARDLE and Medical Ojficer 
MERCER, and carrying forty- 
three passengers to Ganymede in 
the Jovian system. 

The launch was outwardly un- 
eventful. Eurydice lifted into Earth 
orbit, completed her scheduled two 
swings around the home planet, 
successfully dropped off her boost- 
ers to complement Orbital Space 
Station Three, as planned, and 
accelerated into Jovian orbit. Pas- 
sengers were made comfortable, 
introduced to weightlessness, given 
survival training, drilled in the use 
of life pods — Eurydice’s equivalents 
of an ocean-going vessel’s lifeboats. 

First Officer PRESCOTT, how- 
ever, felt he had detected a mal- 
function in the ship's engines during 
Ifioff and subsequent course 
corrections and acceleration. His 
misgivings caused COLLING- 
WOOD and NEILSON to investi- 
gate and the trouble was traced 
to an oversized actuator rod in- 
stalled during assembly. COL- 
LINGWOOD was seriously enough 
injured in the course of the inves- 
tigation to be incapacitated for the 
rest of the trip — he was subjected 
to intense radiation and blinded: he 
received an arm wound; radio- 
active matter entered his lungs. 
The ship's nuclear reaction mass 
also began to overheat dangerously. 

The decision was made to abort 



the voyage and return to Space 
Station Three for repairs to both 
the ship and her captain.

<< T7 t/y? K£)/C£CONTROL. Do 
* -i you read?” 

Mercer had his ears on the cap- 
tain’s respiration and his eyes on 
the passenger-vision pickup, which 
showed a fair amount of socializing 
going on in the module and two 
couples dancing — mixed all-in 
wrestling might have been a better 
description — in the weightless 
section forward of the tank. He did 
not pay much attention to the ex- 
changes between Prescott and 
Eurydice ground control — they 
were too technical for him in any 
case — until the acid tones of the 
first officer became noticeably 
more caustic. 

“. a combination of minor 

oversights, none of which would 
have been individually trouble- 
some,” Prescott was saying. “Next 
thing you’ll tell me that they could 
have happened to anybody.” 

“The man will be fired, of course, 
with the others who m^issed his 
slip-up. But it was basically a cler- 
ical error and he was under stress 
at the time. A domestic problem 
was worrying him, his wife was 
expecting their first — ” 

“I hope,” said Prescott savagely, 
“that she bore him a litter of liz- 
ards. But I’m more concerned with 
effects right now. Just as soon as 
possible we shall apply full thrust. 
But first, before we swap ends to 
decelerate, I must know if the 
nuclear propulsion system is safe. 
The accident knocked out most 



104 



GALAXY 




of our sensory circuits in that area 
and, although the remaining in- 
strumentation gives a confused 
but not exactly dangerous picture, 
I’m worried about that slight rise 
in temperature reported in the 
water tank.” 

“I’m not questioning your de- 
cisions, Prescott, but aren’t you 
over-reacting to all this? The 
chances are that you will have no 
further trouble and that the damage 
is easily repairable. Maybe the cap- 
tain’s condition is not quite as 
serious as you think and in the heat 
of the moment Mercer may have 
mistaken the temperature of the 
tank water and 

“Unlikely,” said Prescott. “There 
have been a few hot moments 
since and he hasn’t- ” 

“Very well, Prescott, carry out 
your abort. We'll allow you half 
an hour to swap ends — no point 
in wasting time if you are set on 
doing it — and give you the numbers 
for full deceleration and insertion 
into the return orbit. Do you still 
want the recovery ship team on 
standby?” 

“Don’t ask stupid questions.” 

“Very well. Eurydice control 
out.” 

Prescott took a deep breath and 
turned to Mercer. “You may have 
thought that I was about to com- 
pliment you back there. Don’t set 
too much store by that — I just 
can’t abide outsiders criticizing one 
of the family, even a new, un- 
trained, foundling member like 
you. 

“But I’ve a job for you,” he went 
on. “Go back and recheck the tank 
temperature. You’ll find insulated 
bottles in the bulkhead locker 



beside the outer seal. Take one. 
You will see that it has a snap 
fastening at the neck, that it is 
double-walled and that there is a 
thermometer with a yellow disk, 
which changes color in certain cir- 
cumstances, between the walls. Go 
into the lock chamber — no need to 
go into the tank itself until we have 
some idea of how much radioactive 
contamination you left behind after 
your first bath. Open one of the 
inner valves - they are plainly 
labeled with operating instructions. 
Press the neck of your bottle 
against the outlet and keep it there 
until it is nearly full. In free fall 
the water will not pour out so you 
may have to wait for a few minutes 
for it to fill ” 

“1 should do this,” said Neilson 
suddenly. “After all. I’m still 
dressed for the job.” 

“Don’t think 1 haven’t noticed,” 
said Prescott sourly. “Pull up your 
shorts, damn it. I have enough 
problems on this ship without 
having my sensibilities blasted by 
the sight of your hairy navel. And 
1 don’t want you or your eyes to 
leave that board. MacArdle will 
monitor the captain’s breathing 
and watch your board, Mercer, so 
move.” 

Since he would not have to go 
into the tank itself Mercer did not 
bother to change. He put on a pur- 
poseful expression and pretended 
not to notice the passengers who 
spoke to him on the way. The 
weightless dancers were not notic- 
ing anyone but each other. He 
found an insulated bottle and en- 
tered the chamber quickly, pressed 
the bottle’s mouth against the out- 
let and began turning the valve. 



DARK INFERNO 



105 




The metal felt very warm. 

Suddenly the bottle thumped 
against the palm of his hand. He 
stared at it stupidly, realizing that 
it was already full and that it should 
not have filled so quickly. As he 
withdrew and sealed the bottle, 
steam and scalding gobbets of 
water spurted from the outlet, 
filling the chamber with a hot, 
blinding fog. Mercer let go of the 
bottle, wrapped his hand in his cap 
and twisted shut the outlet valve 
while with his other hand he groped 
for the evacuation button. He heard 
the combination suction pump and 
air blower -the only means of 
rapidly emptying a compartment 
full of weightless water making 
rude, gurgling sounds. 

But the chamber did not clear 
completely — steam and a fine spray 
of scalding droplets were spurting 
from the edges of the inner seal. 
Mercer retrieved his cap and test 
bottle, whose thermometer showed 
a temperature close to boiling 
point — the disk Prescott had men- 
tioned had turned from yellow to 
muddy brown. Mercer felt like a 
half-boiled lobster with an icy cold 
lump of fear in its belly. Even 
though he did not know what ex- 
actly was happening, he did know 
that it was deadly serious and that 
he had to get back to Prescott fast. 

T he passengers outside had 
other ideas, however. As soon 
as he came out they surrounded 
him, laughing and trying to grab 
him. 

“There’s a black crow among 
the lovebirds,” said one of the men. 
“A wet, black crow.” 

“That isn’t fair,” said one of the 



girls. “You promised us a swim 
and now you’ve had two and — ” 
“With your clothes on!” added 
another girl who had succeeded in 
grabbing his ankle. 

He wanted to yell at her to let 
go or he would kick her pretty, 
laughing face, that he had no time 
for horseplay at a time like this. 
But instead he said, “No ma’am, 
space-washing. I dump my wet 
uniform into a lock, open it to 
space and the moisture boils off. 
It takes out the wrinkles, too. Ex- 
cuse me 1 mustn’t catch cold — ” 
When he entered the control 
room a few minutes later Prescott, 
one hand gripping the engineer’s 
headrest, was hovering over Neil- 
son’s board. He said, “Mercer, you 
do not launder your uniform in 
that incredible fashion, unless you 
don’t mind ice crystals in your 
underpants — and your ability to 
lie convincingly under pressure 
worries me — ” 

He broke off as he saw Mercer’s 
face, then put out his free hand for 
the bottle. 

“It’s hot,” said Mercer. 
Prescott’s features went stiff. 
“In both senses of the word.” He 
handed it to Neilson. “Well?” 

The engineer took one look, then 
said very calmly, “This damn board 
is half dead and the rest of it is sick. 
Getting no response at all from the 
sensors usually means a complete 
power cut-off or a simple circuit 
failure. This tells me that what we 
have is circuit failure — probably 
the cable looms are melted through 
and the amount of heat conducted 
through the stern to the tank tells 
me that we have a reactor melt- 
down situation. At the moment the 



106 



GALAXY 




dampers are in just far enough to 
give power for lighting and life- 
support, but they aren’t locked and 
now I can’t lock them. When the 
rod actuators melt they will pop out 
and the reactor will go critical.” 
“Have you enough power,” said 
Prescott, “to engage with the pas- 
senger module?” 

Neilson nodded. 

“Then do so.” 

Prescott swung himself into his 
couch as the control room began 
gradually to share the spin and 
apparent gravity of the passenger 
section. He undipped the public 
address mike, paused for a mo- 
ment, then said calmly, “Attention, 
ladies and gentlemen. Please stand 
clear of the survival pod hatches. 
They will open in five seconds. 
This is not a drill. We are preparing 
to abandon ship.” 

The words sounded frighteningly 
final. Too much was happening too 
quickly and Mercer desperately 
wanted to go back in time, if only 
for a few minutes, to give himself 
a chance to assimilate the present. 
Inanely he said, “When I was in 
the tank chamber the inner seal 
looked as if it might 
There was a loud thump and the 
edge of the door he was gripping 
jerked under his hand. On the pa.s- 
senger viewscreen he could see 
steam filling the passage leading 
to the tank. 

“It just has,” said Prescott. “But 
the outer seal is much stronger and 
should hold for a while. See what 
you can do for your passengers.” 
Mercer had trouble negotiating 
the normally weightless corridor to 
the passenger compartment because 
the gravity-free forward and stern 



sections were now sharing the ro- 
tation of the central module. This 
was necessary if the four big, 
widely curving supports -which 
carried the power and control links 
fore and aft and allowed the passen- 
ger section to rotate independently 
of the rest of the ship were not to 
si?ag the life pods on their way out. 
The effect on Mercer was that his 
feet were pulling one-eighth G while 
his head and chest were weightless 
and coriolus force was giving him 
an extra twist just for luck. But 
Prescott was not allowing time 
for anyone to think, much less feel 
confused. 

“Attention, ladies and gentle- 
men. The survival pod hatches are 
now open. Please board three to a 
pod in a brisk but orderly manner, 
just as you did during the drill. The 
hatches will be sealed prior to pod 
ejection in five minutes.” 

M ercer was in the passenger 
section by then, furiously 
running over in his head the emer- 
gency instructions he had memor- 
ized only hours earlier. 

He called loudly, “Don’t forget 
to leave behind all personal effects 
that are metal or have sharp edges 
manicure scissors, jewelry with 
large stones or anything that might 
puncture the fabric of the survival 
pod. Don’t worry about losing them 
— you will be fully compensated 
for their actual or sentimental 
value.” 

The last was a stupid thing to say 
at a time like this, thought Mercer. 
The words simply popped out. He 
could imagine what Prescott would 
have to say about them. Unless, of 
course, his subconscious had been 



DARK INFERNO 



107 




working and had decided that 
appearing to worry over trifles at a 
time when all hell was breaking 
loose was also an effective means 
of giving reassurance. 

But suddenly all subtle methods 
of reassurance became superfluous 
as the outer seal of the tank began 
to give. Steam billowed into the 
passenger module, cutting visibility 
to a few yards, while a high-pitched 
whistle made hearing just as dif- 
ficult. Mercer leaned toward the 
nearest couch mike. 

“Control, give me maximum 
lighting, please.” 

Someone screamed, probably 
thinking that there had been an 
explosion, as the lights went up to 
full strength. As a result the pas- 
sengers who had been standing 
around, too stunned by events to 
move, began piling into the pods. 
The process was not orderly but it 
was fast. Mercer stumbled over 
three persons trying to get into a 
pod at the same time. He dragged 
two of them back — no effort under 
quarter-G conditions - and fed 
them in at five-second intervals. A 
few yards farther a woman was 
rolling up the cabin dividers. 

“We won’t be using them again, 
ma’am,” Mercer shouted. “Get 
into your pod.” 

He continued from pod to pod, 
not wasting time on words when a 
good hard push would serve in- 
stead, but usually finding that the 
heads and shoulders were disap- 
pearing with satisfactory rapidity. 

“Anyone who hasn’t found a 
place?” he called. “Speak up, 
please.” 

“Bobby! Where’s Bobby ” 

He glimpsed a moving shape in 



the fog and went after it. The extra 
lighting was making the thickening 
clouds of steam more dazzlingly 
opaque now and was not helping 
visibility at all. He gripped Mrs. 
Mathewson by the arm and pulled 
her toward the nearest hatch. 

“Have you room for one more?” 

“No — full up,” replied a voice 
from inside. 

Mercer swore, not believing it. 
Still gripping Mrs. Mathewson, he 
kneeled apd reached into the pod 
with his free hand. He felt the tops 
of four heads. The pod certainly 
was full. 

“Mercer, hurry.” 

He ignored Prescott’s voice in 
the earpiece and that of the dis- 
traught girl on the other side as he 
moved to the next pod and re- 
peated the question. The white blur 
of a face appeared, then a pair of 
hands. 

“Listen, ma’am,” he shouted as 
gently as he could, “Bobby is safe. 
People feel protective toward 
children and he was probably first 
into someone's pod minutes ago. 
So just- no, let go of my neck. 
He’ll be all right, I promise you — ” 

He was holding her by the arm- 
pits over the open pod and a pair 
of hands were trying to pull her in. 
Suddenly he kissed her steam- and 
tear-streaked face. She was so 
startled that she lost her grip on 
his neck and disappeared into the 
pod. 

I've been doing a lot of things 
without thinking today, he thought, 
and they’ve all seemed to turn out 
right. 

But just then he badly wanted to 
dive into the nearest pod, kick and 
claw his way to the bottom — no 



108 



GALAXY 




matter how many other people 
were in it — and wait until Prescott 
flung them clear. The whistle of 
escaping steam had taken on a 
deeper, burbling tone that probably 
meant that the seal was ready to 
give and that a major explosion 
would come at any moment. And 
as he moved from pod to pod, 
shouting for anyone who had not 
found a place to call out, he found 
himself splashing through a half- 
inch of nearly boiling water. 

The hatch lips were only an inch 
above deck level. The fog was un- 
pleasantly hot and it was difficult 
to breathe. 

He filled his lungs carefully, 
cupped his hands around his mouth 
and shouted, “Is everyone aboard 
the pods?” 

From somewhere in the fog a 
voice called shrilly, then began to 
cough. Mercer headed for the 
sound until a short gray ghost 
loomed out of the dazzling mist. 

It said tearfully, “I’m looking 
for my mother.” 

Mercer grabbed the boy by the 
waist and splashed toward the near- 
est open hatch. There he turned 
him upside down and said very 
clearly, “Your mother is safe, but 
her pod is overcrowded so you’ll 
have to take this one. Wriggle your 
way to the bottom as fast as you 
can — there isn’t much time and 
nobody will object when they see 
who you are. You’ll probably have 
to take charge of this lifeboat, 
Mathewson. Good luck and in you 

go” 

“Room for a small one,” he 
called into the pod. There was no 
reply, but then he had not really 
been asking a question. 



When Bobby’s heels disappeared 
Mercer turned so that his back was 
to the sound of the monstrous 
steam whistle astern, the only 
means of getting his bearings be- 
cause his eyes were closed. He held 
his cap over his nose and mouth to 
make breathing a little easier. 
When he stumbled against a couch 
he remembered something and bent 
down. 

“Prescott, they’re all aboard.” 

“Return to control.” 

The passage leading to the con- 
trol room was slightly cooler - he 
did not need his cap to breathe 
through and he could even see a 
short distance, specifically to a 
recessed basket marked Crew 
Laundry with a couple of rolled-up 
coveralls inside. He took one set 
as he passed. 

The whistle from the stern was 
becoming louder and deeper, but it 
was not as loud as the clang of the 
survival pod hatches going down. 

X 

<<y^LOSE the door and take 
your couch,” said Prescott. 
“We won’t be going anywhere for a 
few minutes.” 

Nobody seemed to be doing any- 
thing except waiting. Mercer did as 
he was told and watched the steam 
that had come in with him being 
shredded and sucked in by the air- 
conditioning. The control room was 
so quiet that he could hear even 
the captain’s breathing. The silence 
was frightening, giving Mercer no 
chance to do anything but think. 

“Neilson,” he said suddenly, 
tossing the soiled coveralls toward 
the engineer, “it’s hot out.” 



DARK INFERNO 



109 




“Bless you,” said Neilson. “With 
my fair Nordic complexion 1 boil 
easy.” He looked inquiringly at 
Prescott. 

The first officer nodded. “Put 
them on. And shut up, both of 
you.” 

Outside came in. 

“Eurydice Control. We have a 
suggestion here that you retain your 
passengers and dump the sick reac- 
tor. Venting the tank astern should 
nudge it away from you and you 
will have a fairly comfortable ship 
to live in until the recovery vessel 
reaches you.” 

Prescott looked at Neilson, who 
turned down the corners of his 
mouth. 

"Eurydice. We have already 
looked at that idea. Negative. We 
have virtually r;o control of any 
stern system other than the tank 
emergency vent.” Prescott leaned 
toward his board, paused, then 
went on, “We are releasing the 
survival pods - now. Time is six- 
teen-oh-five plus fifteen seconds, 
launch zone.” 

“We copy, Eurydice." 

Mercer twisted around to the 
direct-vision port. He could see 
five deflated pods tumbling away 
from the ship, looking like stubs of 
discarded cigarettes. They were 
falling away at eight feet per sec- 
ond, the velocity imparted by the 
passenger module’s centrifugal 
force of one-quarter G. But they 
shared Eurydice’s forward velocity 
so that they kept pace with the ship, 
merely spreading out like a ring of 
receding moons. 

Suddenly they appeared to swell 
and come nearer, but it was only an 
illusion created by their plastic 



canopies pressurized to full size. 
Still receding, they began to slide 
slowly past the viewport. 

The crew survival sections were 
much closer to the ship’s axis than 
had been the pod housings so that, 
to release them with the same ve- 
locity away from the ship, Eury- 
dice had to increase her spin to 
compensate. 

“More trouble,” said Neilson 
quietly. 

Control was alert. “Go ahead, 
Eurydice." 

“The tangential jets are spinning 
us up to release speed, but the cir- 
cuit for cutting them just died. 1 
can’t shut them down. We’ll have to 
release exactly on the pip, twelve 
minutes and seven seconds from — 
now.” 

“We copy.” 

“Set the timers to release auto- 
matically at that time,” said Pres- 
cott. “Do you still have control to 
the stern emergency vent?” 

Neilson showed crossed fingers 
and said, “At the moment, yes.” 

“Set a timer on it to vent ten 
seconds after we release. Can you 
estimate the strength and duration 
of the thrust and the acceleration to 
terminal velocity, allowing for the 
absence of the crew segments, 
rendezvous marker and the re- 
ducing weight of water in the tank?” 

“Some of the water has already 
vented into the passenger section,” 
Neilson replied, “so it will stay with 
the ship and boil off very slowly. 
But I have no way of telling how 
much there is.” 

The conversation was so quiet 
and matter-of-fact that Mercer 
wanted to shout and break things. 
But it was quiet because the con- 



110 



GALAXY 




trol room door was tightly closed 
and the mikes in the passenger 
section had been switched off and, 
apparently, calmness could be just 
as contagious as panic. 

He found himself saying quietly, 
“Between the time the tank's outer 
seal gave way and I left the pas- 
senger section, eight minutes ago, 
the water had risen halfway up the 
rims of the survival hatches —about 
a half-inch. Does that help?" 

“It’s better than making a blind 
guess,” said Neilson. “Lei’s see — 
we know the deck area of the pas- 
senger section and have a rough 
idea of the volume of water cover- 
ing it, but add a little for the water 
content of the steam-” 

“Eurydice Control. Please clar- 
ify. What are your immediate 
intentions?” 

“Eurydice,” Prescott replied. 
“We are not sure if we have a pile 
meltdown or a bang situation. If a 
bang -we want to be as far away 
from it as possible and we also want 
the radioactive debris to be well 
clear of the pickup area when the 
recovery ship arrives. Since our 
reactor controls are out we propose 
venting the tank through the stern 
and bypassing the reactor. Struc- 
tural heating is such that we should 
have a crude steam jet that will 
accelerate the ship ahead and, I 
hope, clear of the survivors before 
the bang. Neilson?” 

“Roughly two feet a second, 
rising to three as she sheds reaction 
mass,” said the engineer. “If the 
structural heating extends to the 
passenger module the water there 
will also vaporize and vent through 
the stern — but the additional thrust 
will be negligible.” 



“We understand, Eurydice. The 
recovery ship countdown is now 
at minus ninety-six hours and three 
minutes. It will be out there in just 
over five days.” 

“You don’t understand,” said 
Prescott sharply. “We don’t need 
a fast rescue. Take your time and 
check the nuts and bolts. You can- 
not risk a launch until Eurydice 
has blown or is a safe distance 
ahead of us.” 

And if it went critical before then, 
Mercer knew, there would be no 
point in launching the recovery 
ship at all. 



M ACARDLE said, “Rendez- 
vous beacon launched at six- 
teen twelve and eight seconds. 
Minimal lateral velocity— just 
enough to let it clear the steam 



“Timers set and checked,” said 
Neilson. 

“Beacon radiating,” said Mac- 
Ardle. 

Prescott took a deep breath and 
looked quickly around the control 
room. He said, “We shall all feel 
a little safer in our cabins. Neilson 
and MacArdle, get going. Mercer, 
hold a moment.” 

Steam was coming from the air- 
conditioning grills now and when 
Neilson and MacArdle left, the rush 
of steam from the passage outside 
dropped the visibility in the control 
room to a few feet. Prescott closed 
the door and moved to Mercer’s 
couch. 

“We have a few minutes to 
spare,” he said quietly, as if he had 
days. “Enough to answer a few 



DARK INFERNO 



111 




questions or to let you get anything 
off your chest that is bothering 
you.” 

Mercer was on the edge of his 
couch, his legs and arms bent and 
body poised for a dive toward the 
door. He was waiting for the fatal 
thump of the steam explosion aft 
that would blow the tank’s outer 
seal, fill the ship with superheated 
vapor and trap Prescott and him- 
self in the control room to boil 
in their own body juices. He wanted 
to kick the first officer out of the 
way and escape right now. 

But he saw a look in Prescott’s 
eyes that was strange in these cir- 
cumstances, yet familiar. Mercer 
had seen it on a few occasions when 
one of his colleagues had become 
too deeply involved with the suffer- 
ing of a seriously ill patient. Pres- 
cott, he realized suddenly, was 
worried about him. He was in- 
viting Mercer to bawl him out with 
no witnesses present, ‘ hoping to 
relieve Mercer’s fear tensions. 

Mercer wanted suddenly to 
laugh, but he got control of him- 
self in time to smile instead. 

He said, “Permission to go to my 
cabin, sir?” 

Prescott looked relieved. “I’ve 
been hard on you, Mercer, for two 
reasons. One is that you have been 
doing penance for the sins of your 
predecessor and the other is that I 
am hard on everybody. But now 
you have been dropped into it along 
with everyone else and there is 
time neither to apologize nor to tell 
you exactly what you should do — ” 

“Eurydice Control. We have 
looked at your steam jet idea. 
There is a strong possibility that 
venting your water astern will 



check the meltdown and delay det- 
onation for a considerable period. 
Thought you would like to know.” 

"Eurydice. Thank you,” said 
Prescott, then went on: “So you 
could do worse than spend the first 
few days in your couch, studying 
the emergency instructions. An 
extra complication is that the pods 
and crew segments will be spinning 
or tumbling slowly- because of our 
control failure the ship’s power 
lines were still connected to them at 
the instant of release and gave 
them an off-center tug as they left. 
But don’t worry about the spin, 
there is no hurry to correct it. Just 
try to calm your passengers as 
quickly as possible, organize your 
communications and give them as 
much help as possible. Good advice 
is about all you can give them, but 
don’t forget to take some of it 
yourself. I’ll be in touch. Let’s go.” 

Control said, “Good luck, 
Eurydice. ” 

Without replying Prescott slid 
back the door. Hot, choking fog 
and the blast of a gigantic steam 
whistle came in as Mercer and 
Prescott, in that order, went out. 

Centrifugal force had changed 
his sick-bay cabin beyond all recog- 
nition, Mercer thought as he stood 
on the transparent canopy, gripping 
two nearly vertical bunks. The pro- 
tective cover had already been 
released from his canopy and he 
could look down past his feet at the 
apparently motionless and un- 
damaged ship and at stars whirling 
past like a blizzard of jewels. A 
faint, wavering line held its posi- 
tion in the starry storm — the re- 
ceding survival pods thrown off 
minutes earlier. He should talk to 



112 



GALAXY 




them — as soon as he discovered 
what he was supposed to say. 

A few seconds after he had 
found the emergency instructions 
booklet he heard a series of thuds 
and clicks as the cabin went auto- 
matically to internal power and his 
feet drifted away from the trans- 
parent floor. 

The stars did not rush past so 
quickly, but they had a twisting 
motion which told him that his 
cabin was no longer spinning evenly 
with the ship but was tumbling free 
in the wake of the passenger cap- 
sules. He caught a glimpse of 
another crew segment, the ship 
whirling past and the incandescent 
streak of the sun. 

Mercer checked on the captain’s 
condition, strapped himself into 
his couch and tried to read. Out- 
side, the abandoned Eurydice was 
growing smaller each time it 
whirled past, but he could not see 
any sign of damage. The sun daz- 
zled him a split-second later. 

He rolled the anti-glare cover 
across the canopy. If the ship blew 
there was no point in risking being 
blinded by two suns. 



XI 

Since only four of the five 
cabins used by the ship’s of- 
ficers double as survival mod- 
ules, the medical officer and 
first officer will share the sick- 
bay segment, which is fitted 
with pod frequency radio even 
more powerful than that car- 
ried by the captain’s survival 
segment. — Emergency Instruc- 
tions 



I F HE had not been lucky and 
the captain unlucky, Mercer 
would have had to share his seg- 
ment with Prescott. As things were, 
the first officer was now spinning 
away in the captain’s module. 

According to the emergency in- 
structions, the captain’s module 
contained communications equip- 
ment that enabled it to maintain 
contact with ground control as well 
as allowing two-way contact with 
the other officers and, to a limited 
extent, with passenger pods in its 
vicinity. One frequency allowed its 
occupant to listen at any time to 
what was going on in the other of- 
ficers’ modules. Another channel 
allowed them to call him but not 
each "other. The officers had a chan- 
nel for speaking to the passengers- 
just one channel, unfortunately, 
so that they had to address all the 
pod occupants at once. Another 
allowed them to eavesdrop on the 
pods in case trouble developed 
among the survivors. But this was 
also a single channel, which meant 
that the officer using it would hear 
any and all passengers who hap- 
pened to be speaking at any given 
time. 

It was not difficult to understand 
why the captain had to be able to 
keep close tabs on -his officers and a 
two-way line open to home — or, 
for that matter, why the sick-bay’s 
radio had most of its power chan- 
neled into the pod frequency. The 
survivors were expected to need 
medical advice more than any other 
kind and, with the distance between 
the potential patients and their 
doctor increasing every second, 
advice was all he could give them. 
The sooner he started giving it 



DARK INFERNO 



113 




the better, but he did not want to 
begin until he understood the prob- 
lems in more depth than did the 
survivors and was able to give 
answers that would sound authori- 
tative. 

A large proportion of the manual 
was devoted to instructions for 
space officers on how to maneuver 
and navigate the segment and make 
the best use of its services and ac- 
cessories. While the instructions 
for trained astronauts were un- 
necessarily technical, Mercer 
thought that the section dealing 
with passengers seemed to be aimed 
at people with a mental age of 
twelve. The medical side was barely 
mentioned, but the psychological 
problems he was told to expect 
seemed incredibly melodramatic. 
He had to remind himself that even 
on Earth people managed to do 
some dramatic things to themselves 
and each other. When they were 
spinning through eternity in a ten- 
foot plastic bubble, driven close to 
madness by fear and the utter, 
savage strangeness of it all, it might 
be easier for them to forget that 
they were civilized beings. 

Suddenly he felt ashamed of him- 
self for lying in his couch, reading, 
a solid, well-furnished structure 
around him and the sunlight a 
pulsing amber glow behind the 
canopy filters. He tried to compare 
his condition with those prevailing 
in the survival pods, where three or 
more passengers were tumbling to- 
gether in a fragile plastic bubble 
and he could not readily imagine 
the total contrast. Even if some of 
the passengers kept their heads and 
tried to read the simple instructions 
printed at intervals on the interior 



of the plastic wall — the bubbles 
were transparent and the glare of 
the sun would probably make the 
texts impossible to see clearly until 
screens could be made completely 
operative. 

He had been reading for all of 
twenty-two minutes, by his watch. 
The technical passages he could 
study later, but the instructions 
regarding the passengers should be 
obeyed as soon as possible. A pull- 
out sheet at the back of the book 
contained pod numbers and spaces 
for the names of the occupants. 
Mercer taped it to the bulkhead 
beside him and undipped his mike. 

“Your attention, ladies and 
gentlemen,” he said slowly and 
distinctly. “It is less than thirty 
minutes since we abandoned ship. 
You are probably becoming ac- 
customed to being inside a survival 
pod by now and are beginning to 
realize that the accommodation 
leaves a lot to be desired. However, 
you are absolutely safe and the 
spinning movement of your pods is 
nothing to worry about.” 

He paused to let this reassurance 
sink in. 

Then; “Some of you may already 
have read the instructions for 
checking spin and have put them 
into effect. To those who haven’t 
done so or who may have problems 
I shall be able to give instructions 
in due course. But first I must 
check that everyone got safely off 
the ship. Relatives and friends may 
have become separated and I must 
begin by making roll call of all 
survivors so that I can reassure 
these people. Would the occupants 
of Pod One please speak their 
names — and would everyone else 



114 



GALAXY 




keep absolutely quiet while Pod 
One reports in?” 

ERCER flipped up the re- 
ceiver switch and discovered 
that all his charges were talking at 
the tops of their voices. He tried 
again. 

“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said 
sharply, “you are all speaking at 
once. I must insist on silence except 
for the occupants of Pod One.” 

He became more and more insis- 
tent as the minutes slipped past, but 
he still could not silence the voices 
from Pods Two through Sixteen. 
Twice he very nearly had it when 
only two pods were talking at once 
and he almost understood what Pod 
One was trying so patiently to tell 
him, but then everyone else seemed 
to sense that his or her own per- 
sonal demands for assistance, 
advice or information had a chance 
of being heard and Mercer’s 
speaker poured out only a high- 
pitched babble. 

“All of you, be quiet! Pod One, 
come in, please.” 

“Pod One. For the fiftieth time — 
Mr. Wallace, Mr. Rutherford, Mr. 
Gunning.” 

“Thank you. One,” said IV^ercer, 
noting the names on his sheet. “Pod 
Two?” 

“Mrs. Wallace, Mr. Simpson, 
Mr. McCall. We can’t get this 
damned thing to stop spinning and 
the sun is — ” 

“Thank you. Two,” said Mercer. 
He relented slightly. “Each pod has 
one pair of anti-glare goggles in its 
medical pack. Try to remember the 
pod sequences from the instruction 
film and let the person with the 
goggles supervise. I’ll come back to 



you as soon as the tally of passen- 
gers is complete. Pod Three?” 
“Mrs. Mathewson, Mr. Stone, 
Mr. Kirk.” 

“Pod Four?” 

“Mr. and Mrs. Corrie.” 

“Pod Five?” 

“M iss Moore, Miss Sampson, 
Mrs. Kirk and Mr. Eglin.” 

Mercer made a note to check on 
the life-support duration of a pod 
with four occupants, wondering 
wryly if the psychological problems 
would turn out to be a much greater 
threat to the pod’s safety than a 
possible shortage of food and air. 
“Pod Six?” 

The interruptions were few, and 
Mercer worked steadily through his 
checklist until he came to Pod 
Eleven, which did not answer. He 
tried again. 

“Pod Eleven, come in please.” 
Again silence answered him. 
Mercer turned up the gain on his 
receiver to maximum. The silence 
grew noisier as the sounds of 
breathing and body movements 
coming from the other pods were 
suddenly magnified. Someone 
coughed deafeningly. 

From Pod Three Mrs. Mathew- 
son screamed: “Bobby, what’s 

happened to Bobby?” 

Mercer turned down the volume 
quickly. He, too, had begun to 
wonder what had happened to the 
boy. It was by no means certain 
that Bobby was aboard Eleven. 
Perhaps nobody was aboard Eleven. 

The ship had carried a more than 
adequate supply of survival pods 
for the number of passengers 
aboard. So far he had one pod with 
two people in it, two pods with four 
people on board and the rest with 




DARK INFERNO 



115 




three occupants, so that it was 
probable that in the confusion and 
poor visibility at least one pod had 
been launched empty. 

“Pod Twelve, please.” 

While he jotted down the names 
of the passengers on Twelve and 
then Thirteen, Mercer began to 
worry that Eleven’s radio might be 
faulty. Where was the boy? 

“Pod Fourteen?” 

“M — Mathewson.” 

Mercer wanted badly to express 
his relief. Then he thought about 
the game he had been playing with 
young Mathewson and all at once it 
seemed to be a good idea, consider- 
ing what he knew of the boy’s back- 
ground, to go on playing it. 

“Very well, Mathewson, please 
list the names of your crew,” he 
said briskly and waited. 

“Just — me.” 

Mercer wanted to say something, 
anything, that would reassure the 
boy, but he needed time to think 
and he did not have it. All he could 
do was go on playing the game and 
hope that Bobby would be able to 
go on playing it as well. 

“1 copy. Pod Fourteen,” he said. 
“1 will come back to you with 
instructions later, Mathewson. 
Meanwhile, you have control. Pod 
Fifteen?” 

A few minutes later he had the 
names of the rest of the survivors 
and was preparing to check them 
against the passenger list. He 
switched off the pod frequency to 
allow himself to concentrate on 
what he was doing — with the small 
part of his mind that was not wor- 
rying about the Mathewson boy 
and his mother. During the initial 
exchange he had repeated the boy’s 



name simply to let the mother 
know that he was safe. But now she 
would know that he was alone as 
well. 

His speaker came to life. “Pres- 
cott. What progress, Mercer?” 



I NSTINCTIVELY he reached 
for the transmit switch to an- 
swer, then lowered his hand. Pres- 
cott was listening in. Mercer could 
do nothing about it short of tear- 
ing out the radio installation, cut- 
ting himself off from everyone else 
and risking damage to the other 
electrical systems in the module. 
He decided that he did not dislike 
the sound of Prescott’s voice enough 
to risk any of those eventualities. 

“I have completed the tally of 
survivors,” he said, “and now I’m 
cross-checking against the passen- 
ger list.” 

“Carry on while I talk. The situ- 
ation at present is that Eurydice is 
still pulling ahead of us on her tea- 
kettle drive, but slowly. Should the 
reactor go critical now we would 
have no chance of escaping. But 
there is a much better chance that 
it will simply melt into a radio- 
active mess and the resulting mild 
explosion will scatter debris and 
radiation over a comparatively 
small volume of space. This would 
also mean that the fuel slugs we 
were carrying as cargo for the 
Ganymede Base reactor will be 
scattered instead of contributing 
their megatonnage to the blast. 
Have you got that?” 

“Yes,” said Mercer. He added: 
“All the passengers made it to the 
pods.” 

“Good. I spent a few minutes 



116 



GALAXY 




listening to your rollcall. You seem 
to be handling things fairly well — 
one reason we are minding our own 
business and letting you do the 
same. We have had to spend some 
time on stabilizing our segments 
and repositioning them so that our 
directional antennas will bear — 
mine on Eurydice Control, Neil- 
son’s on the ship in the hope of 
getting a few minutes’ warning 
before she blows. MacArdle’s 
antenna is on the radio beacon we 
dropped, which will be on low 
emission until the time comes for us 
to burn for rendezvous. I think you 
were unnecessarily tough on young 
Mathewson.” 

Mercer double-checked to make 
sure that the passengers were not 
receiving the conversation, but he 
did not reply. 

“I want your reaction, Mercer.” 

“Sorry, I thought you were sim- 
ply giving your opinion,” said 
Mercer, not caring if he sounded 
insubordinate or merely angry. 
“Maybe 1 was wrong to handle it 
that way because I don’t know very 
much about the boy or his mother. 
But 1 do know a little. The woman 
is escaping — ” his tone became 
clinical — “whether from an event 
or a person I don’t at the moment 
know. I do know that the boy’s 
father was far gone on PCs, so 
perhaps he got himself killed or he 
suicided during a change party — or 
maybe he survived physically but 
with the original personality lost 
along with the ability to mentate. 
The woman, I would say, has never 
been on PCs — she was and is too 
worried and tense and — well — 
normal. The boy shows some signs 
of emotional disturbance, but is 



otherwise also normal. He has 
a uniform and wants to play 
spaceman.” 

“I noticed that.” 

“The trouble is,” Mercer con- 
tinued, “I have been playing the 
game with him by treating him — 
and talking to him — as if he were a 
junior ship’s officer. Part of the 
game was that I did not act toward 
him as I acted toward the other 
passengers — they were asked to do 
things, he was told. You realize the 
position I’m in? If 1 change sud- 
denly from being a superior officer, 
even a pretend superior officer, to a 
sentimental softie who tells him 
that he is a good boy and not to cry, 
there could be trouble. His father 
must have subjected him to the 
same kind of major personality 
change several times a week and 
the kid did not like it. The way I 
see it, rather than be nice some- 
times and nasty at others it is better 
to be consistently nasty.” 

“I’ve found that myself.” 

“The next step,” Mercer went on, 
“will be to help him stabilize his 
pod and not sound too much like a 
worried father while I’m doing it.” 
“Very well. It’s your problem.” 
“And his,” said Mercer. 

XII 

<^/^UIET, everyone. Pod Four- 
teen, come in, please.” 
Mercer’s voice. 

Kirk, in Pod Three, hung close 
against the interior face of the 
services module, knees drawn up 
and elbows tight against his chest 
as he gripped one of the soft plas- 
tic handles projecting from it. His 
eyes were tightly shut despite the 



DARK INFERNO 



117 




anti-glare goggles he Was wearing. 
His small, hairless head, thick 
neck, sloping shoulders and wide 
waist gave him the visual aspect, 
from the back, of an enormous, 
lumpy pear. 

Close beside him Stone was hold- 
ing on with one hand while the 
other covered his eyes. “If you’re 
not using the damn things,” he 
whispered, “give them to me.” 

At the other end of Pod Three 
Mrs. Mathewson also had a hand 
over her eyes. The other one was 
gripping a screen attachment point 
while her head was inclined toward 
the speaker grill. She wanted to 
hear what Mercer wanted to say to 
Bobby in Pod Fourteen. She could 
not, of course, hear her son. 

“Please,” she whispered. 

“Sorry,” said Stone in an even 
quieter whisper. “But there are 
people who take no notice unless 
you shout at the top of your voice.” 
He tapped Kirk on the shoulder 
and pointed at the goggles. 

Kirk let go of the plastic grip 
with one hand. Without warning he 
swung it back, hitting Stone in the 
chest with his closed fist and fore- 
arm and sending him spinning 
slowly across the pod. Then he 
pulled off the goggles and threw 
them at Stone. 

Stone blundered into Mrs. 
Mathewson’s legs and instinctively 
grabbed them to steady himself, 
with the result that they both swung 
into the flexible wall of the pod 
which gave alarmingly with their 
weight before bouncing them away 
again. For a few seconds the whole 
pod grew bulges and indentations 
until it reached dynamic equilib- 
rium again and the spinning sun 



took up an even more complex 
motion. 

Squinting against the intermit- 
tent glare. Stone fished the goggles 
out of the air and put them on. He 
looked at Kirk’s back for a long 
time, but the tinted eyepiece made 
it impossible to read his expression. 

Pod Fourteen had evidently an- 
swered — Mercer’s voice came 
again over the speaker, replying to 
whatever Bobby Mathewson had 
said. 

“I know’ it isn’t. But first you 
must put on the goggles. You will 
find them clipped to the underside 
of the lid with a red cross on it. 
While you are finding them and 
putting them on I will explain why 
this is not like the demonstration 
film. That film showed a simple 
abandon-ship sequence that al- 
lowed enough time for the pods to 
be manned and all ship-to-pod con- 
nections severed by the ship’s 
officers before launching. The con- 
nection that has caused our trouble 
was a thin cable that carried ship’s 
power to a pod, so that it could 
be tested or used for survival drills 
without wasting its own internal 
power. This cable should have 
been cut by a remote-controlled 
knife, which is also, for manual 
operation, fitted to a handle that 
projects through the pod hatch 
cover. But there was too much 
steam in the passenger compart- 
ment and not enough time for me to 
go around pulling handles, and the 
circuits to the remote-controlled 
actuators were dead. 

“When the pods were launched 
the cable tugged the pods side- 
ways as they left and gave some of 
them a twist as well. Normally the 



118 



GALAXY 




pods and cabin segments would not 
spin at all as they came free, but 
you have to remember that there 
is no real difference between start- 
ing a spin to change the attitude 
of your vehicle and stopping it. 
Just as long as you - 

“No, Mathewson, not that kind 
of knife, but it cuts just as well. 
Are you ready?” 

“It’s too complicated,” said Mrs. 
Mathewson. 

“He’s a smart boy,” Stone 
whispered. 

“Right.” The whispers in Pod 
Three had evidently reached Mer- 
cer. “The first thing to do is to lie 
as flat as you can against the pod 
skin, the transparent section, and 
hold on to the molded finger grips 
in the plastic. Got that? Then move 
around until the sun seems to be 
coming from the top of your head, 
passing in front of you and then 
moving under your feet. Take your 
time, Mathewson. There’s no hurry 
about this.” 

Stone stared at the sun — it was 
whipping over and around the pod 
so quickly that he could only guess 
at its direction of travel. He opened 
his mouth to speak to Mrs. 
Mathewson, then remembered that 
they were supposed to keep the 
frequency clear for the boy and 
shut it again. 

Others, apparently, had forgotten. 

“Ouiet, everyone,” Mercer said. 
“I lost some of that, Mathewson. 
Say again, please, slow and easy.” 

“Don’t cry, Bobby,” said Mrs. 
Mathewson softly. “Please don’t 
cry.” 

“Going too fast, you say? I see. 
There is a trick you can try that 
should beat that one. Get flat 



against the plastic again, look out- 
side and blink as fast as you can. 
That will make the sun seem to 
stop or at least go past in short 
streaks that will let you know the 
direction it is traveling in. Ready? 
Now — ” 

“It works, by God,” breathed 
Stone. 

“When you know the direction, 
get the sun to come from above 
your head and go down past your 
face aad under your feet. Keep it 
moving like that as you start to 
crawl forward. When you come to 
the lock section or the services 
panel — or when you are crawling 
over plastic that is not transparent 
— try to keep your line of move- 
ment straight by looking ahead to 
the next transparent section to see 
where the sun is. Got that? Then off 
you go.” 

Stone began to crawl, trying to 
keep the incandescent band of the 
sun vertically in front of him and 
his body flat against the plastic. He 
was not very successful in doing 
either. 

“I know. But don’t try to rush 
it, Mathewson. Try for a steady 
even movement and don’t worry if 
the sun appears to drift sideways — 
when you have checked the tumb- 
ling motion of your vehicle it will 
be easy for you to turn at right 
angles and, check the sideways 
movement. But it will be a slow job 
because this is a solo mission for 
you. If you had more people on 
board they could cooperate, space 
themselves at intervals around 
the inside of the pod and crawl in 
the same direction— or hold on to 
each other with their feet against 
the plastic and walk sideways. 



DARK INFERNO 



119 




“But that is their problem, 
Mathewson. Yours is that your 
body mass is small in relation to 
the mass of the vehicle you are 
controlling, so you are going to 
have to put in some long-distance 
crawling.” 

Stone’s erratic crawl took him 
within a few inches of Kirk. As he 
moved past he asked quietly, “Are 
you going to help me?” 

“I don’t know what he’s talking 
about,” said Kirk angrily. 

“He’s explaining,” said Stone, 
“so a ten-year-old would under- 
stand it.” 

“Sorry, Mathewson, your ve- 
hicle does not have attitude jets — 
we don’t want to make the job 
too easy, do we? But you do have 
some power — two short-duration 
thrusters that must be used only to 
make rendezvous with the recovery 
ship.” 

As Stone crawled past Mrs. 
Mathewson he whispered. “Don’t 
worry, he’ll be all right. But I could 
use some help and it might take 
your mind off the boy for a while 
if you — ” 

“Stop talking about me. Stone,” 
said Kirk suddenly, “or I’ll smash 
you.” 

“Quiet! Please keep this fre- 
quency clear for Pod Fourteen. 
That’s fine, Mathewson — do an- 
other circuit on the same line. You 
won’t notice much change until 
you’ve been around twenty or 
thirty times. If you have any prob- 
lems call me. Listening out.” 

O N POD Three the stabiliza- 
tion exercise was not going 
well. Stone found it difficult 
enough to keep his feet and legs 



from drifting away from the plastic 
skin, but Mrs. Mathewson was 
in a worse predicament — she had 
to cover her eyes with one hand, 
which made crawling virtually 
impossible, or use both hands and 
keep her eyes tightly shut, which 
meant that she could not see where 
she was going. 

Stone said, “Suppose we stand at 
opposite sides of the pod with our 
heads together in the center and 
facing each other. If we grip each 
other’s arms and begin walking for- 
ward, I can guide us while you keep 
your eyes shut. Would you like to 
try it for a while?” 

But the strain of gripping each 
other’s arms was considerable even 
if they did not weigh anything and 
their combined length was much 
greater than the internal diameter 
of the pod so that the plastic ma- 
terial bulged outward alarmingly 
under their feet. But they were be- 
ginning to get the hang of it when 
Stone spoke again. 

“I never could stand roundabouts 
as a kid, you know. Or swings. Es- 
pecially the instant when you stop 
swinging up and haven’t yet started 
to come down. This — this bothers 
me. Some time I’ll tell you all 
about my childish fears, but right 
now I’m busy. Right foot, Mrs. 
Mathewson. Now the left, slowly. 
Right. Left 

On Pod Five the situation was 
much less orderly, with four slowly 
struggling bodies and six plastic 
screens filling the living space. Just 
after the pod had been released 
from the ship the screens had been 
kicked from their fastenings, and 
there had been too much shouting 
and crying since then for anyone to 



120 



GALAXY 




think about replacing them. But 
Mercer’s voice on the radio and the 
Mathewson boy’s trouble had 
brought silence at least. 

“Let’s get ourselves organized,’’ 
whispered Eglin. “We’ll start by 
clearing these crazy mobiles — 
throw them aft at me and I’ll refold 
them. Then try to stand with your 
heads together in the center and 
your feet at equal intervals around 
the skin like the man said. I’ll wear 
the goggles and keep you on the 
right line while you’re walking side- 
ways.’’ 

Later as the women were rotating 
like a human three-bladed propel- 
ler, Eglin realized that he could 
keep them on the right line by 
watching how the sunlight struck 
each of them as it whirled around. 
The effect was visually dramatic, 
he thought, and wished that he had 
had the time to grab his camera. 

“Don’t rush it, Mathewson. 
Move slowly and steadily — try to 
imagine that you are still and that 
you are pulling the pod around 
underneath you. Or imagine that 
you are on the inside of a tread- 
mill. Do you know what a tread- 
mill is?’’ 

Pod Four was already motion- 
less. The opaque, silvered half of its 
envelope was aimed directly at the 
sun so that the interior was in dark- 
ness and the stars shone cold and 
clear through the transparent sec- 
tion. It was the first pod to be sta- 
bilized and the reason was that Mr. 
Corrie was an astrophysicist. He 
had been starting to check his pod’s 
spin before Mercer had left the 
control room on Eurydice. 

“I can see Three and Five,’’ he 
whispered. “Not very clearly and in 



a few hours they will be too far 
away to see at all. I wish I knew 
which was which, but I don’t know 
our direction of travel or whether 
we are right side up with respect 
to — But wait. All the pods are 
points on the circumference of an 
expanding circle, so that an imag- 
inary line drawn between Three and 
Five must pass behind us, so that 
would give our direction of travel. 
But I still can’t tell whether we’re 
upside down or not — ” 

“Not so loud, George.’’ 

“Sorry, I’d forgotten the boy.” 
“Do you realize, George,” whis- 
pered Mrs. Corrie, whose aptitudes 
had always lain in the softer sci- 
ences, “that we’ve never been really 
alone together for the past eighteen 
years?” 

“Take another rest, Mathewson. 
And yes, drink as much and as 
often as you feel like it. Water will 
never be a problem, but you don’t 
want to let yourself get overtired or 
overheated —you can’t just open a 
window, you know. Your life- 
support system will, in normal con- 
ditions, handle the heat generated 
by three adult bodies at rest, but I 
may have been working you too 
hard. While you’re resting read the 
instructions on the food dispenser 
and the other essential services. 
If there is anything you don’t 
understand, ask me.” 

In Pod Two Mrs. Wallace was 
rigging the plastic screens designed 
to give a measure of privacy to one 
of the essential services while Simp- 
son and McCall tried to rotate their 
now stable vehicle into a position 
that would give them enough light 
to work without being blinded by 
the sun. They were doing this by 



DARK INFERNO 



121 




allowing sunshine to strike the in- 
side face of the entry lock but not 
to shine into the section enclosed by 
opaque material. 

“Why will water never be a prob- 
lem?” she asked, then added: “Oh, 
I see.” 

A few minutes later McCall, who 
was studying the instruction book- 
let, said, “Water will never be a 
problem because it is recycled, but 
to me that implies that there will be 
other problems — food, air, heat 
dissipation. It says here that the 
pod food supply is of a low-residue, 
highly concentrated kind and that 
its lack of bulk will mean that we 
will always feel hungry, even 
though our bodies will have enough 
to keep them alive. In a three- 
person pod like this one the food 
will last just under two weeks, ac- 
cording to this chart. But everyone 
knows that it is possible to reduce 
food intake when one is ..not using 
energy. I don’t get it. People on 
lifeboats at sea have survived for 
longer with less food and a desa- 
lination kit.” 

“The people on the lifeboats,” 
Simpson said dryly, “also had un- 
limited quantities of fresh air.” 

“Quiet, please.” Mercer again. 

Mercer’s voice erupted from the 
pod speakers every few minutes for 
the next three hours. Sometimes 
what he said was immediately help- 
ful to people in difficulties — either 
physical or psychological — in cer- 
tain pods. It was as if he had been 
listening to them — as indeed he 
had — and had slipped in the answer 
to their particular problem during 
his next conversation with the 
Mathewson boy. As a result, pod 
after pod successfully stabilized 
itself, and the occupants began to 



rig screens, familiarize themselves 
with their rather spartan fittings 
and generally make themselves as 
comfortable as possible. 

There was no panic. Every time a 
survivor grew excited or even raised 
his or her voice to an ordinary con- 
versational level, Mercer’s voice 
rattled out of the speaker at all of 
them to be quiet and keep the 
channel clear for Pod Fourteen. It 
was extremely difficult to have a 
panic reaction in a whisper and 
knowing that someone else was in 
a worse fix than their own helped to 
keep down the fears of many. 

But finally even the conversation 
with Pod Fourteen came to an end. 

“Fine work, Mathewson. Leave 
rigging your screens until later. 
Right now you must eat and sleep. 
That’s an order. 

“You heard that, Mrs. Mathew- 
son — he’s all right. You have an 
astronaut in the family.” 

In Pod Three Mrs. Mathewson 
was still holding herself steady with 
one hand while the other covered 
her eyes, even though the interior 
was screened and shaded from the 
sun. She was smiling and large, 
weightless tears were being 
squeezed between her fingers. 

Mercer’s voice: “Your attention, 
ladies and gentlemen. Are there any 
of you — apart from myself — who 
have not yet been able to stabilize 
your pod?” 



XIII 

ii-pRESCOTT. What are you 
Agoing, Mercer?” 

Unlike the uncluttered survival 
pods, the medical officer’s segment 



122 



GALAXY 




had bunks, an airlock and cabinets 
housing various services projecting 
into it -its mass was something like 
sixteen times that of the passenger 
vehicles. Checking its spin was not 
an easy matter. 

“I’m trying to stabilize the seg- 
ment,” Mercer said, trying also to 
hide his breathlessness. His legs, 
arms and shoulders were burning 
with fatigue and he wondered if the 
only thing that was keeping his eyes 
from dropping shut was the ab- 
sence of gravity. He added; “An- 
other fifteen minutes should do it.” 

“Good. While you’re working, 
listen carefully. MacArdle is the 
worrying kind. He has to compute 
return courses for each pod and 
crew segment - these will enable us 
to make rendezvous should the 
radio beacon fail. To make his 
computations he has to know where 
exactly, as well as who, everybody 
is. According to the book this exer- 
cise could be done tomorrow or the 
next day — even allowing for the 
increased scatter by that time, the 
pod flares should be pretty hard to 
miss. But these people are not 
trained observers and might miss 
seeing their neighbors’ flares, which 
means that he would not be able to 
work out a course for them. He 
wants that data now. Can you keep 
young Mathewson awake?” 

“The problem there,” said 
Mercer, “is getting him to go to 
sleep.” 

“Right. This is going to take a 
little time to set up as well as to 
explain. Listen, for the time being 
ask for clarification if you don’t 
completely understand something, 
but go on checking your spin. When 
you’ve finished you will need a 



large sheet of paper and a 
pencil. .” 

It took a half-hour for Mercer to 
get a clear mental picture of what 
was needed and to explain it all to 
the passengers. He then positioned 
himself close against his canopy, 
his pod transmitter switched on, his 
pencil ready and a large sheet of 
paper with Prescott’s diagram on 
it taped to the side of a bunk. 

The diagram consisted of a circle 
whose circumference was divided 
into sixteen equal parts, the points 
numbered from one to sixteen in a 
clockwise direction. Inside this 
circle was a slightly smaller one, 
representing the positions occupied 
by the crew segments. The circum- 
ference of the second circle was 
divided into four, but the positions 
were marked lightly because there 
was no way of knowing at that time 
where any particular segment was 
in relation to any given pod. With 
luck the next hour or so would give 
this information. 

“Prescott. Ready when you are, 
Mercer.” 

“Observers in Pod Two and Pod 
Sixteen stand by,” said Mercer. 
“Pod One, release your flare.” 

The distress flares burned bright- 
ly for thirty seconds, illuminating 
the expanding cloud of gas they re- 
leased just before ignition. They 
faded gradually. Neither the ex- 
panding circle of pods nor the 
smaller ring of crew segments had 
spread sufficiently for the flares 
to be invisible because of distance. 
But Mercer could not see One’s 
flare either in the canopy or 
through the wide-angle periscope 
that served the blind areas of his 
segment. 



DARK INFERNO 



123 




“Pod Two. I see it.” 

“Pod Sixteen. Me, too.” 
“Prescott. I have it.” 

The first officer had left on his 
crew frequency receiver so that 
Mercer could hear Neilson and 
MacArdle reporting negative re- 
sults. He himself failed to see One’s 
flare. 

“Pods One and Three stand by,” 
he said. “Your turn. Two.” 

A few seconds later Pod Two was 
seen by its neighbors and Prescott. 

Mercer saw Three’s flare bright 
and clear and, a few minutes later, 
the flares released by Four and 
Five. He estimated that he was 
twice as close to Four as he was to 
Five and marked his position on the 
inner circle accordingly. At that 
point he could have marked the 
positions of the other segments and 
named them, because they were 
spaced equally and he knew their 
order — working clockwise they 
were MacArdle, Neilson, Prescott 
in the captain’s segment and his 
own. But he preferred to wait until 
he heard them reporting in before 
marking their positions. He ac- 
quired Six and both he and Mac- 
Ardle were able to see Seven. 

Finally the exercise was over. 
Mercer thanked the passengers for 
their cooperation, checked the 
condition of the captain and then 
strapped himself loosely into his 
couch. 

“Prescott. What are you doing 
now, Mercer?” 

“Sleeping,” said Mercer. 

“Carry on.” 

M ercer switched off the pod 
receiver so that Prescott’s 
voice was the last sound he heard. 



It was also, after what seemed only 
a few minutes, the first. 

He rubbed his eyes, licked dried 
lips with a dehydrated tongue and 
said, “I’m awake, I think.” 

“You snore like a shuttle taking 
off, Mercer. Now listen. I have 
been doing your job for you — 
eavesdropping on the survivors — 
for the last hour. Some of them are 
beginning to sound worried. But 
before you start telling them lies, 
which you are very good at, I want 
to make sure that your lying and 
half-truth telling will have a 
tenuous connection with the real 
facts of the situation. I don’t want 
you to be caught out in a lie, you 
understand, because that could be 
very bad for morale. So, I am a 
nervous passenger. Reassure me.” 

“I don’t under — ” began Mercer. 
Then he cleared his throat and said, 
“What exactly is troubling you, 
sir?” 

“I’ll tell you what’s troubling me, 
mister. The smell of this over- 
crowded goldfish bowl is troubling 
me. How soon do we get out of it?” 

Mercer pulled out his book, then 
realized that Prescott would prob- 
ably hear him flipping through the 
pages- -and replaced it. He had a 
good memory. 

“You must realize, sir,” he said 
smoothly, “that all this is largely 
the product of your mind and its 
awareness of your crowded con- 
ditions — this awareness heightens 
your sensitivity to perspiration and 
similar odors. These are not — 
repeat not — due to any malfunction 
in your capsule air-conditioning 
or waste-disposal or reclamation 
systems. As for recovery, that 
should not be delayed by more than 



124 



GALAXY 




a few days — ” 

“Wrong, Mercer. It could be de- 
layed for more than two weeks.” 

“Oh,” said Mercer. But Prescott 
was not giving him time to think. 

“We’re hungry and it’s hot in 
here.” 

“You can increase the apparent 
bulk of the food by adding water, 
sir. There is no shortage of water.” 

“We don’t like the water. It 
stinks, too.” 

“In actual fact, sir, your capsule 
water, recycled as it is, is much less 
harmful than that taken from any 
Earthside reservoir — there is much 
less pollution in it, for one thing. 
I’m afraid the smell is purely 
an illusion, sir — it comes from 
your dwelling too much on its 
source. As for the temperature 
problem — that is caused by body 
heat produced by your recent ex- 
ertions in getting your pod sta- 
bilized and your screens set up. 
You have also — probably — been 
moving around and using energy — 
producing heat — simply because 
you are excited or curious about 
your new surroundings. The correct 
course is to relax and remain ab- 
solutely still in the shade of your 
individual screens and remove some 
clothing if you have to until the 
air-conditioning system brings 
down the temperature. Drink and 
talk as much as you like, but don’t 
use energy because that produces 
heat. If you do as I suggest you will 
find that the pod temperature will 
remain comfortable and even 
for—” 

“Sorry, Mercer. It will get a hell 
of a lot hotter. Eurydice’s course, 
which is also ours, passes within the 
orbit of Venus and makes its closest 



approach to the sun in nine days’ 
time.” 

Angrily, because he was suddenly 
frightened, Mercer asked, “What 
about the recovery ship? Why do 
we have to wait?” 

“I’m supposed to be questioning 
you. But i’ll give you the facts so 
that you’ll know how best to bend 
them for passenger consumption. 
The countdown on the recovery 
ship was started before we aban- 
doned Eurydice and at present it is 
holding at minus twelve hours, 
which is the time needed to ready 
the high-acceleration boosters. It 
is waiting for the same reason that 
we are — for Eurydice to blow.” 

“The sooner the better,” said 
Mercer with feeling. “Then we can 
head back to the rendezvous 
point.” 

“Well, no. You would be right if 
the reactor and cargo radioactives 
blew up relatively slowly and threw 
off chunks of slow-moving radio- 
active debris. We could wait for a 
day or so until it had cleared the 
area and there would be no need to 
delay launching the recovery ship. 
But suppose the ship becomes a 
bomb that flings out a sphere of 
vaporized metal and generally acts 
like a scaled-down nova. Close in, 
this material would go through the 
capsule plastic like a charge of 
microscopic buckshot, besides 
flooding the area with lethal radi- 
ation. At the present time we are 
much too close to survive it. But 
the radiation and the effects of the 
debris diminish with distance. You 
know about the inverse square law, 
I suppose?” 

“Yes,” said Mercer. “But 
how long do we have to wait to 



DARK INFERNO 



125 




stand a fair chance of surviving 
the blowup?” 

“A few days. But obviously we 
can’t start back to the rendezvous 
point until after she blows, or we 
would be heading into trouble in- 
stead of out of it. A complication 
is that the reactor’s fail-safe devices 
may hold longer than we want them 
to.” 

“But the A thrusters in the pods 
will only accelerate them to six- 
teen feet per second, which means 
that they can kill their outward 
velocity and return at eight, their 
present outward speed. The opera- 
tional life of the pods is only two 
weeks.” 

“A little more if the occupants do 
nothing but breathe, sleep and talk 
without getting excited. You must 
try to keep them from becoming 
excited.” 

“Worried or frightened, you 
mean?” 

“I mean excited.” 

“Oh.” 

“Now you will be able to explain 
to them why the recovery ship will 
not be launched until after the 
blowup. Remind them that it is an 
unmanned, high-acceleration job 
that will waste no time in getting 
here. There is something else you 
should do, although there is no 
great urgency about it. Try to teach 
the passengers some elementary 
astronomy. Neilson tells me that, 
despite the superheated steam that 
exited from the stern for a few 
hours after we abandoned ship, 
Eurydice has not pulled ahead as 
quickly as we had hoped. That 
could mean that the rendezvous 
beacon might be damaged when she 
blows and the fancy pod navigation 



aids that make repositioning the 
pods for the rendezvous burn such 
an easy job will not be working. 
The passengers may then have to 
take up the proper attitude the hard 
way and get it right first time.” 

“I understand,” said Mercer, 
wondering where his saliva had 
gone. 

He had been too busy until now 
to have time to feel afraid and he 
had, in any case, thought that the 
worst was over when passengers 
and crew had escaped safely from 
Eurydice. But the truth was that 
they had not yet escaped Eurydice 
and if they did they might not be 
able to get back to the pickup point 
before their consumables ran out. 
Too, there was no absolute guar- 
antee that the recovery ship — which 
was unmanned and had a long way 
to travel — would make the rendez- 
vous point. 

“That about covers the situation, 
Mercer. Is anything else troubling 
you?” 

Mercer was silent for a moment, 
thinking about his problems but 
afraid to start listing them — he 
might begin to whine at Prescott. 
He would rather die than show fear 
to the first officer. He wondered, 
not for the first time, if bravery 
were simply a stronger fear of being 
thought a coward. 

“Yes, sir,” he said finally. “I am 
a ship’s officer needing reassurance. 
Reassure me.” 

XIV 

M ercer dispensed a mixture 
of heavily shaped truth and 
quiet optimism with the result 
that the passengers, after six days 



126 



GALAXY 




in the survival capsules, were un- 
comfortable but not unduly wor- 
ried. A fair proportion of them 
were unworried enough to feel 
bored and, despite Mercer’s 
warnings, made attempts to relieve 
their boredom in fashions that 
generated a lot of heat. 

Pod Four was not the first to 
generate excessive internal heat and 
probably it would not be the last. 

After allowing the higher levels 
of his mind to be withdrawn from 
all effective control of his body for 
several hectic minutes, Corrie was 
suffering his usual reaction. It took 
the form of being coldly analytical 
about everything and everyone 
around him. 

“I cannot understand why it is 
so hot,” he said. “Granted that 
we are part of a closed and bal- 
anced system into which energy in 
the form of heat has been intro- 
duced, there are only two of us in 
a capsule designed for three, which 
means that there should be a fifty 
percent margin on cooling, air 
supply, food. The second law of 
thermodynamics indicates that — 
let go of me, dear, I want to try an 
experiment — if I set myself spin- 
ning in the middle of the pod the 
only energy needed will be that 
required to initiate the spin. But 
the movement of air past my skin 
should have a cooling effect — ” 
“Don’t move,” said Mrs. Corrie 
drowsily. 

“But we’re hot and slippery and 
— I wonder what it’s like on the 
capsules with three and four people. 
It must be really hot.” 

“Not if they behave themselves 
like the man said, George.” 

Corrie laughed. He said, “Any 



minute now our Listening Tom will 
read us a polite sermon — couched 
ih very general terms, of course, 
and not mentioning the sinners 
by name — ” 

“Your attention, ladies and 
gentlemen, 1 must remind some of 
you once again to refrain from un- 
necessary physical exertion. Rest, 
conserve your food and air. Exer- 
cise should be purely intellectual. 

I have suggested, and a few of you 
have devised, some useful ques- 
tion-and-answer games. 

Mr. Mathewson, it is time for 
another astronomy lesson. .” 

It was really hot in Pod Five, 
almost unbearably hot. But the oc- 
cupants had no way of knowing 
how much worse were the condi- 
tions in Five than in the pods carry- 
ing the Corries or the threesome 
of Stone, Kirk and Mrs. Mathew- 
son, so they simply complained as 
everyone else was complaining. 
Some complaints went unvoiced — 
about stench produced by sweat 
and the overloaded waste disposal 
unit and the equally overworked 
water reclamation system for 
instance — because they all were 
trying hard not to think about 
those particular problems. 

In Five the plastic screens which 
had shielded the occupants from 
each other had been dismantled 
when the inmates discovered that 
privacy interfered with the free 
circulation of the air. The removal 
of the screens generated a lot of 
emotional heat while making the 
environment fractionally cooler. 
Surprisingly, the removal of other 
items that interfered with the free 
circulation of air, such as clothing, 
was accomplished with very little 



DARK INFERNO 



127 




fuss. It had become much too hot to 
worry about clothing or the neo- 
Puritanism which dictated that the 
female body be completely covered 
except in the privacy of the home. 
Perhaps Pod Five was beginning to 
feel like home. 

“I’m hot and hungry,” said Mrs. 
Kirk suddenly. “I’ve read about 
people being cold and hungry. I 
envy them.” 

“And I envy you,” said Miss 
Moore, who was spinning slowly 
about her longitudinal axis, legs 
and arms akimbo and even her 
fingers open to catch the maximum 
benefits from her self-generated 
breeze. She went on, “I envy your 
flab. You’ve got more fatty reserves 
than the rest of us put together and 
an enforced diet is just what you 
need. By rights you shouldn’t eat 
anything because we will starve 
long before you do, especially if we 
go on splitting the food four ways. 
I’m hungry, too, damn you.” 

“It isn’t nice to call me flabby 
even if it is true,” said Mrs. Kirk. 
“Besides, my husband is even fatter 
than I am and he must be suffering 
terribly by now. Fat people have 
enlarged stomachs, you know, and 
feel much hungrier than slim ones 
like you. But you are just afraid of 
being so thin that Eglin will stop 
ogling you.” 

“I want out of this thing,” said 
Miss Sampson. She was drifting 
close against the transparent sec- 
tion, staring into space. “Please, 
can 1 get out of this thing?” 

“Don’t be stupid,” said Miss 
Moore without. taking her eyes off 
Mrs. Kirk. “Your pigmentation 
gives you protection against the 
heat and you people are born and 



raised in famine conditions.” 

“1 think you’re wrong,” said Mrs. 
Kirk. “Their skin color protects 
them against strong sunlight, but 
not against high humidity. I re- 
member reading that — ” 

“Reading must have been your 
only form of amusement,” said 
M iss Moore, “and looking at you I 
can understand why.” 

“That isn’t—” 

“I can remember reading a 
story,” Miss Moore went on, 
“where the oldest and most expend- 
able member of a party of travelers 
was sacrificed for the safety of the 
others. They threw her to the 
wolves, as I remember. We would 
not be so wasteful. What do you 
say, Sampson? Cannibalism was 
practiced by your people fairly 
recently. Give us the benefit of your 
expertise.” 

“Soap, bathe,” said Miss Samp- 
son. “Swim in the sea.” 

T DON’T blame her for ignor- 
X ing you,” said Mrs. Kirk, 
She paused for a moment and when 
she went on her voice was quiet, 
reasonable and utterly malicious. 
“Seriously, you would never get 
hungry enough to eat me because 
you haven’t really thought about 
what it would entail. Not all of me 
is edible, you know, and the waste 
disposal unit will take just ^o much. 
Bones, for instance. Some of them 
would be big and hard to break up 
into a convenient size for the unit — 
especially when they are freshly 
gnawed and slippery and you can 
only use your teeth and bare hands 
to break them. And then there are 
items like hair and toenails and 
lungs and eyeballs and — ” 



128

“You’re making me sick.’’ 

“If you are as hungry as you say,’’ 
said Mrs. Kirk, “I don’t see how 
you can have anything to be sick 
with.’’ 

“Shut up,’’ said Eglin, “both of 
you.’’ 

For a few moments silence 
reigned, although the atmosphere 
was thickly charged with anger in 
addition to the heat, humidity and a 
multiplicity of body odors. Eglin 
could not help noticing the atmo- 
sphere because his lips were pressed 
together in anger and he was 
breathing heavily through his nose 
as he glared at each of the three 
women in turn. 

During the first few days in the 
pod Eglin had been too embar- 
rassed even to look at them when 
they were fully clothed, because he 
usually found that they were look- 
ing at him and he did not know 
what they were thinking or what 
they thought he might be thinking 
when he looked at them. And when 
the increasing heat and humidity 
forced them all to peel, the situation 
had become even more embarrass- 
ing — but only for a short time 
because very often he was in fact 
thinking what they thought he was 
thinking and there was no way for 
him to conceal the fact. So he had 
begun staring at each of them in 
turn so that their feelings would not 
be hurt by his appearing to admire 
one of them more than the others. 

Now he was too hot and angry 
and frustrated and hungry to 
bother showing consideration and 
he spent most of the time watching 
Miss Moore because she was the 
best-looking one and she usually 
caused the most trouble. 



Eglin ran his hand over his fore- 
head, face and the wet, black smear 
that was his week-old beard, push- 
ing away the thick, weightless drops 
of sweat. He thought of several 
ways of making Miss Moore stop 
her continuous arguing and sniping 
and blatant displaying of her un- 
doubtedly beautiful body, all of 
them pleasant -to him. He was so 
engrossed that the trouble had 
already started before he realized 
that there was any danger at all. 

Miss Sampson was sobbing and 
clawing furiously at the plastic 
envelope and her nails were long 
because, unlike the other two, she 
did not nibble at them when she was 
worried. When the fury of her 
attack caused her to drift away 
from the plastic, she kicked at it. 
The act sent her bouncing against 
the opposite side, where she clawed 
and kicked again. With each 
bounce the fabric of the pod 
stretched and bulged frighteningly 
and the sun bobbed over the edge of 
the opaque section. She collided 
several times with Miss Moore and 
Mrs. Kirk, but accidentally, be- 
cause she did not try to attack 
them. At least not until Mrs. Kirk 
tried to restrain her and got two 
long, red nailmarks on her forearm 
for her trouble. 

Cursing, Eglin planted his feet 
against the solid plastic of the 
services panel and launched himself 
on an interception course. They 
collided softly and awkwardly, 
rolling and bouncing along the 
plastic canopy until they ended in 
the middle of the pod spinning 
slowly together. 

By that time Eglin was facing her 
and had a tight grip on both her 



DARK INFERNO 



129 




wrists and was holding them 
against the small of her back. He 
was afraid for a moment that she 
might use her knees on him or take 
a bite out of his face with her even 
and startlingly white teeth, but 
suddenly she relaxed against him 
and began to cry. 

“Nice try, Sampson,” said Miss 
Moore furiously. “Hysterics, a 
good old-fashioned wrestle and 
then the dissolve into tears — the 
oldest trick there is. But it isn’t 
going to get you anything, Samp- 
son, because it’s too damned hot in 
here as it is. You just get away 
from him!” 

“Jealous?” asked Mrs. Kirk. 

But she and Miss Moore were 
each gripping one of Miss Samp- 
son’s shoulders and pushing Eglin 
away with their free hands. He 
realized, not for the first time since 
they had been flung away from 
Eurydice together, that he was 
living in a wish-fulfillment dream 
but that for all the good it was 
doing him he might just as well be 
living in a monastery. 

“All right, all right,” he said in a 
tone that said that nothing, most 
decidedly, was right. “If you can’t 
sleep and won’t stop nagging at 
each other, let’s do what the man 
says and try a little intellectual 
exercise — guessing games.” He 
flung out an arm in an angry wave 
that encompassed the pod, the 
people in it and the whole of cre- 
ation outside, and said, “I’m 
thinking of something beginning 
with — with ‘S.’ ” 

“Sagittarius?” asked Mrs. Kirk, 
beginning the game. 

“The — the sun?” Miss Sampson 
inquired. 



“Obviously,” said Miss Moore. 

Mercer’s voice: “If you can’t see 
the constellations as I’ve described 
them, don’t change the attitude of 
your pod. Spin yourself very slowly 
inside the transparent section and 
watch the stars until you see the 
proper formation. That way uses 
less energy and produces much less 
heat.” 



I N POD Three the situation was 
somewhat different. A hypo- 
thetical observer armed with an ac- 
curate thermometer would have 
said that the internal temperature 
was fractionally cooler than that of 
Pod Five. A psychiatrist would 
have been worried sick. 

Kirk drifted like some lumpy, 
organic airship over the services 
panel, permanently tethered to it by 
one fat, hairy hand. His eyes never 
seemod to leave Mrs. Mathewson 
who floated at the other end of the 
pod. The only times he did not 
watch her was when Stone man- 
aged to drift between them, which 
was as often as possible. 

No guessing games, no quizzes, 
no group intellectual exercises of 
any kind took place in Pod Three. 
When Kirk spoke he broke a 
silence that had lasted for at least 
six hours. 

“Why does he talk to the kid so 
much?” he complained. “The boy is 
a special case, I know, but Mercer 
could surely give someone else the 
benefit of some of his individual 
attention.” 

It was a reasonable complaint 
compared with some of the others 
he had made earlier and his tone 
was conciliatory — as if he were 



130 



GALAXY 




trying to start a conversation that 
would not end in a bitter argument. 

Mrs. Mathewson brushed away 
hair clinging wetly to her face and 
said, “I think he’s trying to teach 
and help all of us, as Mr. Stone 
said, and is pretending to teach only 
Bobby so as not to offend the others 
by making his instructions too 
simple for them.” 

She looked from one man to the 
other, trying to bring them together 
and pleading silently with Stone not 
to make things worse. But Stone 
was not looking at her and so could 
not hear the silent pleading. 

“You’re cheating on the food, 
Kirk,” he said. “We aren’t getting 
our fair share.” 

“You don’t need a fair share,” 
said the other man. “A skinny runt 
like you needs to eat hardly 
anything.” 

“I’ve always wanted to try a 
crash diet,” said Mrs. Mathewson, 
still trying to pour on verbal 
oil, “and never had the nerve. But 
now — ” 

“Inside every fat man,” said 
Stone, still not looking at her, 
“there is a skinny slob who let 
himself go.” 

“Please,” said Mrs. Mathewson, 
“please stop fighting over the food.” 

Stone drifted slowly around to 
face her. He said, “Use your brain, 
woman. We’re not fighting over the 
food.” 

Mercer’s voice: “Your attention, 
ladies and gentlemen. As you know 
we are following Eurydice’s origi- 
nal course. During the next few 
days it will make its closest ap- 
proach to the sun. Let me assure 
you that the temperature will not 
rise above bearable limits even in 



the overcrowded pods, provided 
you remain at rest and do not gen- 
erate unnecessary heat. The food 
supply is adequate, it is simply that 
its lack of bulk makes you think 
that you are starving. The elevated 
temperature is also causing a rapid 
loss of weight. Think of the situa- 
tion as follows: taken as a whole. 
Earth is also overcrowded and 
underfed, and firm control is needed 
if the available resources are not to 
be wasted and the population is not 
to perish of its own pollution or by 
too much self-generated atomic 
heat. You people are all facing the 
same problems on a greatly reduced 
scale and some of you are having to 
adapt to situations you rarely, if 
ever, were involved with on Earth — 
social imbalance, conflict, even a 
small-scale war may here seem to 
be unavoidable. But a war will kill 
everyone in your tiny plastic world 
just as surely as it would decimate 
your home planet. You must avoid 
fighting at all costs. Remember 
that you are human beings and not 
animals — and keep control.” 

In Pod Fourteen control was 
easy, if slow. Mathewson knew 
exactly how to change the attitude 
of his vehicle and he was learning 
how to line up the dividing line 
between the clear and the opaque 
material with groups of stars when 
Mercer gave the order. He was 
hungry, but not very, and he was 
not uncomfortably warm even with 
his uniform and cap on. Fourteen’s 
life-support system, catering as it 
was for one young boy instead of 
three adults, was keeping him 
comfortable. 

Mercer had given him permission 
to strip if he wanted to, but had 



DARK INFERNO 



131 




warned him against exposing his 
skin to the sun. According to 
Mercer the only space-tanned 
astronauts were the ones who 
appeared in TV plays. Real space- 
men avoided the sun. A good space- 
man learned to control himself as 
well as his ship, Mercer had said, 
and to keep his mind busy and 
alert. Space was beautiful — but 
lonely and dangerous if one did not 
keep control. 

Mathewson knew that he did not 
always keep control. Sometimes he 
wanted to play some other game 
than this one of spaceman, which 
never stopped. At such times he 
tired of memorizing stars and doing 
practice runs over the tiny control 
panel or crawling inch by inch 
along the plastic to keep a certain 
star exactly in position. But he 
could not change the game and he 
couldn’t even stop playing it. 

Sometimes he wondered if Mer- 
cer knew when he lost control and 
started shouting to fill up the 
emptiness — or crying because 
nobody was near him. After he had 
cried the first time Mercer had 
explained to someone in another 
pod that there were psychological 
and technical reasons why he could 
not arrange two-way contact with 
separated husbands and wives and 
loved ones. He had said that argu- 
ments within the pods were hard 
enough to control without risking 
their starting between the capsules 
and that the passengers were be- 
coming so widely scattered that his 
receiver’s speaker could not be 
turned up loud enough to energize 
his transmitter mike, which was on 
a bulkhead several feet away. 

But Mercer could not have heard 



him crying because Mercer had not 
changed. Mercer had started by 
treating Mathewson like one of the 
crew and had not changed at all. As 
the commander of this spacecraft 
Mathewson should not be caught 
crying and he should stop doing it 
before his luck ran out and Mercer 
caught him at it. 

But sometimes when he awoke 
with no bed or blankets around 
him, just warm air and plastic and 
very faraway stars, he could not 
help becoming frightened. 

Mercer’s voice: “Attention, 

attention. I have received a signal 
that Eurydice will blow in approxi- 
mately three minutes. Whatever 
you are doing, cover your eyes at 
once. Keep them covered for at 
least thirty seconds after the flash. 
Do not, I repeat, do not try to 
watch it through your goggles or 
peek at it between a crack m your 
fingers. If you look it could be the 
last thing you will ever see.’’ 

While he was speaking Mercer 
pushed the captain’s bunk into its 
recess and shut the airtight flap. 
Between the metal of the bunk, the 
bandages and the damaged eyes 
which might not be capable of 
registering light anyway, Colling- 
wood was adequately protected 
from the flash. Mercer covered his 
face as he had told the passengers 
to, because Prescott had told him to 
do it, but in much more pungent 
language. 

Despite his hand and his tightly 
closed eyes behind it he saw the 
flash as a bright, pink blotch that 
faded very slowly. 

When he uncovered to look out- 
side he saw a beautiful, spherical 
aurora writhing and expanding to 



132 



GALAXY 




fill all of space. The radio brought 
in a deafening rattle of static and 
the radiation level was climbing 
steadily. 

While he had been relaying Neil- 
son’s warning Prescott had said 
that the reactor’s safety devices had 
kept the cork in too long and that it 
would be a big one — possibly the 
biggest nuclear explosion so far, 
but they should be safe. Mercer 
hoped that the first officer was not 
simply trying to be reassuring. 

XV 

T hrough the window of 

Brannigan’s office the recovery 
ship loomed against the sky like a 
narrow white pyramid wrapped in 
the red lace of its service gantries. 
There were no signs of activity on 
or around it, but that situation 
could change within a few minutes. 
The decision would be Brannigan’s 
alone and he should take it now, 
instead of pretending that it would 
be arrived at by the democratic 
process of listening to advice. 
Brannigan swung away from the 
window to stare along the center of 
the table that joined his desk like 
the vertical bar of a fat, gray T. 

To nobody in particular he said, 
“We’re wasting time.” 

“I disagree,” said Perkins. “It is 
less than thirty-five minutes since 
Eurydice blew.” 

“That bird out there costs nearly 
twice as much as the lost ship,” 
said Musgrave. Then, apologetic- 
ally; “As the company accountant 
I’m supposed to remind you of 
things like that before you throw 
good money after bad.” 

“He has a point,” said Beck. 



“The delayed blowup will not hurt 
anyone, but a lot more delay will be 
caused while making sure that 
untrained passengers orient them- 
selves properly toward the rendez- 
vous point plus, of course, the 
time needed to get there. I can 
place our bird within one thousand 
meters of the rendezvous beacon — 
but will there be anyone there to 
rescue? We really should wait until 
we have their report on the 
consumables.” 

“We might wait a long time,” 
said McKeever in his dry, lecturing 
voice. “The blast has converted 
Eurydice into a rapidly expanding 
zone of radio interference — rather 
like a spherical Heaviside Layer — 
through which we, with our high- 
powered equipment, can punch a 
signal. But they won’t have the 
power to answer us until the volume 
of interference has enlarged and 
become so diffuse that their signal 
and that of rendezvous beacon — if 
it still exists — can get through. The 
shortest estimate that I can give for 
the clearance of this radio fog is 
three days — and it seems to me that 
Beck cannot simply aim at the 
center of the explosion. Neilson 
used a crude steam jet — whose 
angle and thrust are not known 
with accuracy — that caused Eury- 
dice to move ahead and prob- 
ably veer off course. If we are going 
for a late-evening launch we will 
have to use the figures MacArdle 
gave us.” 

“But can we accept them for a 
launch as important as this?” asked 
Beck. “And if the beacon has been 
taken out by the explosion, how 
will the passengers find their way to 
the rendezvous point?” 



DARK INFERNO 



133 




Dr. Lassiter cleared his throat. 
He said, “With one exception I 
know these officers very well 
indeed. You can accept MacArdle’s 
figures. As for the passengers’ 
making rendezvous without a 
beacon, you know that the medic 
has been giving them simple 
lessons in astronomy and astro- 
navigation — coached by Prescott 
and MacArdle, of course.’’ 

“Do you approve of Mercer?’’ 
asked Beck. “Does Prescott?” 

“I do,” said Lassiter, “and 
Prescott approves of nothing and 
nobody. But he hasn’t called 
Mercer incompetent, which is 
tantamount to an unsolicited testi- 
monial. The part that worries me, 
however, is the fact that the pods 
will arrive at the rendezvous point 
dangerously low on air, and the two 
overloaded capsules will be in even 
worse condition. That ship out 
there is fast — but we’ve had to wait 
a long time while Eurydice up 
her mind to blow and the survivors 
are quite far away now. My figures 
aren’t as accurate as Beck’s, but 
I’d say that if we don’t launch as 
soon as possible there will be an 
awful lot of freshly asphyxiated 
corpses at the rendezvous point.” 
Dr. Lassiter represented the 
softest science in the room, which 
was why he tended to worry more 
about the space-going software. 

“That’s it,” said Brannigan 
abruptly. “We try for a rescue.” 



T he decision taken — appar- 
ently by democratic process — 
Beck communicated it to the 
launch crew. Any remaining ques- 
tions would be those of policy and 



where policy was concerned, 
Brannigan was a dictator. 

“If we go for a rescue,” said 
Westgate suddenly, “we will have 
to say a lot more about the 
disaster. What do I tell the media?” 

“Nothing,” said Brannigan. 
“The first major accident has 
occurred to a passenger-carrying 
spaceship, the passengers and ship’s 
officers are safe in their survival 
capsules and a rescue operation 
already formulated to meet this 
contingency has been put into 
effect. Nothing more until we know 
whether or not it is successful.” 

Westgate’s objections were as 
smooth as a good PR man’s should 
be and not immediately identifiable 
as objections. He said, “Yes, of 
course. There have been no fatali- 
ties as yet and there is no reason to 
worry the next-of-kin until they 
actually occur. At the same time — 
we are going to be held responsible 
for this disaster by the public, even 
though we can show that it was a 
vendor company who was really to 
blame. Unless we focus a lot of 
unwelcome attention elsewhere for 
a while — long enough for us to 
work out satisfactory answers to a 
number of very awkward questions 
— we could take an awful pasting 
from the press and TV. Those boys 
hate like hell to have anything kept 
from them. 

“This is the first disaster of its 
kind,” Westgate went on, “and it 
has everything. The captain injured, 
perhaps dying and unable to direct 
the survival operation. One pod 
with a kid in it trying to do the job 
of three men. The conditions 
inside the pods while they were 
waiting for Eurydice to blow — the 



134 



GALAXY 




heat and hunger and overcrowding, 
the strangers thrown together into 
conditions of intimacy, and that 
imbalance sexwise. It is the 
biggest cliffhanger since Apollo 
Thirteen. There would be no 
problem in slanting it to make us 
look like heroes instead of villains 
and for me to handle it so that the 
majority of the media people will 
feel obligated to us for life — ” 

The others Joined in some agru- 
ing with Westgate and putting up 
alternative suggestions — everyone 
seemed to have the idea that public 
relations, like writing, photography 
and painting, was a job that could 
be performed just as well by 
amateurs. Dr. Lassiter sat staring 
silently into the far distance at 
fragile plastic bubbles full of hot, 
stale and stinking air, thinking of 
the people who were being forced to 
breathe it. Brannigan was staring 
into the same area of space. 

“Checking sequence initiated on 
booster rings Two, Three and 
Four,” said a voice from the 
speaker on Brannigan’s desk. 
“Checks completed on tanks A and 
B on ring One and fueling under 
way. Minus eleven hours and thirty- 
seven minutes and counting. .” 



E verything looked so 

normal and peaceful, Mercer 
thought resentfully as he tried to 
dry the perspiration from his face 
with even sweatier hands. The 
vaporized plastic and metal that 
had been the ship had cooled and 
scattered into invisibility and only 
the deafening rattle of static on the 
pod frequency was left, that and 
the readings on the radiation 



indicator, which were rapidly 
slipping back to normal. 

He had turned down the volume 
on the pod frequency because the 
voices he heard were either lost in 
the mush or were all sounding off 
at once. In order not to feel 
completely useless he spent some 
time helping the captain — stripping 
him of all but his bandages to make 
him feel as comfortable as possible 
and reinforcing his sedation. Then 
Mercer drifted back to the canopy 
to think and sweat and look at the 
stars. 

Static erupted thunderously from 
his speaker-^a whisper of intelli- 
gence was trying to fight its way 
through the din. Mercer gritted his 
teeth and moved closer. 

“Prescott. Come in, Mercer.” 
“Mercer here. Go ahead.” 
“Prescott. Come in, Mercer. 
Try to . against the mike and 
. be able to hear you.” 

Mercer put his lips within an inch 
of the mike and acknowledged at 
the top of his voice. 

“Better. Now listen carefully and 
. for a repeat if you don’t . 
MacArdle says that this muck will 
clear over the next few . will 
allow pod and segment frequencies 
to be worked in about two hours. 
Two-way contact with Eurydice 
Control will not be possible for at 
least . but they know what to do 
without my telling them. Our job 
is to get the pods headed back . 
possible after the segments are on 
their way, I will link you to . your 
instructions. In case you’re think- 
ing that it’s wrong . passengers 
should go first. We must . ren- 
dezvous first to help look for them 
. on stragglers. If you understand 



DARK INFERNO 



135 




. to MacArdle.” 

“I understand,” Mercer shouted 
and a new voice began fighting its 
way through the interference. 

“MacArdle. The beacon was 
taken out by the blowup so . the 
hard way. Your A thrusters are set 
below the floor grill center line. 
When you fire make . you are 
diametrically opposite . occupied 
by the captain so that . weights 
will be equally distributed about 
your center of thrust. Have you 
got that?” 

“Yes,” bellowed Mercer. 

“You won’t be able to see the sky 
in your direction of thrust because 
of the segment configuration and 
neither will the pod people because 
their services module will be in the 
way, so you will have to establish 
attitude from points at right angles 
to your proposed line of flight. You 
will . sitting position with your 
back to the seal and sight along the 
top edge of the third line of bunks. 
The glare shield supports will give 
you a second referent and . lower 
half of Orion projects from the 
right into your canopy field of view 
just above the center line. Below 
. Sirius on the opposite edge of 
the canopy and, although you won’t 
be able to see it from that position, 
if you lean to the left you will have 
Aldebaran and above it the Pleiades 
as a check. Do . repeat that?” 

“No.” 

“You understand ... a first 
approximation and that . more 
accurate attitude checks later. Is 
there any other information you 
need?” 

“No, thanks,” yelled Mercer. 
He added; You seem to have a 
photographic memory where my 



segment is concerned. Were you a 
patient in it?” 

“Detailed structural data ... in 
the captain’s segment. Prescott 
worked out the sighting arrange- 
ments. But now you must get your 
segment lined up with . me know 
when you’re ready for the first 
attitude check.” 

“I’ll give you a shout.” 

“That’s very good. Doctor.” 
“Prescott. Stop chattering, you 
two. MacArdle, Neilson next. 
Mercer, you know what you have 
to do.” 

W HILE Mercer sweated at 
changing the attitude of his 
segment he could not help looking 
at the locked control panel set 
above his couch. Like the other 
crew segments, his had provision 
for making rapid and accurate 
changes of attitude, but anyone 
who was not a trained astronaut 
could very easily send his vehicle 
spinning helplessly out of control if 
he tried using anything but the pre- 
measured A and B thrusters. Pres- 
cott had not even mentioned the 
possibility of Mercer’s being able 
to fly the vehicle, much less for- 
bidden him to do so. 

The radio interference had faded 
a little as he worked. When Mercer 
turned up the volume on the pod 
frequency he could make out a 
babble of voices through the static. 
Apparently they were now close to 
the center of the expanding sphere 
of interference and signals could 
get neither in nor out. But the 
sphere was hollow and the people 
inside it could talk to each other 
and would be able to do so with less 
and less trouble as time went on. 



136 



GALAXY 




He heard every word MacArdle 
spoke while he made the tiny move- 
ments that placed the segment into 
its pre-burn position. He held him- 
self still as instructed, making 
sure that the segment was not drift- 
ing off the line. But when Mac- 
Ardle spoke again he could not 
move at all and for several minutes 
he could not even speak. 

“MacArdle. Acknowledge, Mer- 
cer. Have you got trouble?” 

He could actually feel the glob- 
ules of sweat growing on his skin, 
making his hands slippery and his 
back skid along the lock seal. He 
shook his head violently and the 
newly dislodged perspiration 
drifted before his face and tasted 
salty when he breathed it in. The 
stars burning coldly through the 
canopy were suddenly a mass of 
incomprehensible lights with no 
recognizable order or meaning, the 
imaginary lines that linked them to- 
gether gone so that he did not know 
what he was seeing. 

Mercer had thought that he 
could not feel more afraid than he 
had in the howling, steam-filled 
chaos of the passenger compart- 
ment of Eurydice — but he had been 
wrong. 

“I — I don’t think I’ve got this 
right,” he said finally. 

The ensuing silence stretched 
through an eternity, though it could 
only have lasted for a few seconds. 
Mercer wondered if MacArdle 
would speak or if Prescott would 
cut in with some pointed and abra- 
sive comment. He could imagine 
what the first officer was thinking 
about him now. 

“MacArdle. You seemed to be 
doing fine until a few minutes ago 



— I mean, the Pleiades and Sirius 
and Orion are pretty distinctive 
referents. Butjusttryto relax. Drift 
forward to the canopy and have a 
good look around to make abso- 
lutely sure that you have the right 
constellations. Make sure you 
shield your eyes from the sun or 
you’ll waste a lot of time waiting 
for your night vision to come back. 
But take your time. Don’t let me 
rush you and don’t push the button 
because you’re afraid or ashamed 
or because you want to put your- 
self out of your agony. Sf'ou must 
get it right first time.” 

Mercer’s voice wouldn’t work. 

“Maybe the captain can help 
you.” 

“The captain is under sedation,” 
said Mercer sharply, “and he can’t 
see anyway. I would only be giving 
him something more to worry 
about. I’ll go forward and have 
another look around.” 

“I was going to ask you to do 
that in any case. Doctor. We all 
have to double-check on something 
as important as this. And remem- 
ber, when you start your burn give 
me a ten-second countdown so that 
I will know the exact time of firing 
and the time you will have to fire 
your B thrusters at the rendezvous 
point — otherwise you might go 
sailing past. And don’t worry if 
nobody seems to be there when you 
arrive — we may be too widely 
scattered to see each other without 
flares.” 

When the burn came the sensa- 
tion of weight was so strange that 
Mercer thought that he would 
drown in the softness of the bunk. 
In a few seconds it was over and he 
coiled and stowed the cable and

remote-control switch which had 
enabled him to fire the thruster 
from his position opposite the 
captain. 

“Prescott. The sooner the pods 
are turned around the better, Mer- 
cer. You have done most of the 
talking to them so far and you may 
as well continue. How will you han- 
dle it? Numerically?” 

“Yes,” said Mercer. “Taking 
them in numerical order will stop 
any argument about who gets in- 
structions first — but there are three 
exceptions. Two of the pods are 
carrying four people and will run 
out of air before the others and 
nobody will object to the Mathew- 
son boy’s jumping the queue — ” 

“I do, Mercer. Bringing back the 
overloaded pods first is a good idea, 
but the boy can comfortably wait 
his turn or even come in last. He 
will not, repeat not, run out of air 
and food.” 

“I understand,” said Mercer. 
“Good. Now go to work on the 
passengers. Don’t waste time, but 
don’t appear to be rushing them 
either. MacArdle will give you the 
referents for each pod as you need 
them and you will translate them 
to your passengers. I, ah, know 
that you will appreciate their 
problems.”

of us,” said Stone, “is 
v_/ considerably heavier than 
the other two. Will this swing us off 
course when we apply thrust?” 
“Not very much, Three, but you 
may as well get it absolutely right 
and seat the two lighter passengers 
closer together and facing the heavy 



one. But make sure that your move- 
ments have not set up a drift away 
from your marker stars.” 

“You never miss a trick,” mut- 
tered Kirk. 

“Don’t be so blasted sensitive,” 
returned Stone. “I deliberately did 
not say which of us was the fat one 
and I very much doubt that Mercer 
remembers us. Relax, Kirk — it was 
a purely technical question. Or is 
the thought of my sitting close to 
the lady bothering you?” 

“Don’t tell me to relax in that 
tone of voice,” said Kirk angrily. 
“You’re deliberately giving Mercer 
the impression that I’m ready to go 
beserk and that all 1 can think a- 
bout is women.” 

“You certainly haven’t thought 
much about repositioning this 
thing,” Stone replied. “And don’t 
move or we’ll have to spend another 
half-hour getting the right stars 
lined up. Be a good man and wait 
until after the burn before you take 
a swipe at me.” 

“1 haven’t had to think — with a 
cool, scientific mind like yours 
directing the operation,” Kirk said. 
“Or maybe you are just pretending 
to know it all so that she will think 
you are some kind of champion 
scientist who deserves — and intends 
to claim — his prize.” 

“Shut up, Kirk.” 

“In a minute. I just want to re- 
mind you of a scientific fact. This 
overweight body you are always 
making cracks about and she tries 
not to look at has lived on Earth 
for fifty-two years. It has developed 
muscles to lift and move itself a- 
round under one Earth gravity — 
pretty big muscles, though they 
don’t show — and in weightless con-

ditions they will not be hampered 
very much by the fatty overlay. 
Just remember that before you start 
claiming any prizes.” 

“Stop it,” said Mrs. Mathewson, 
speaking for the first time that day. 
“Stop fighting and stop talking 
about me as if I were one of the 
food packs. You’re both old enough 
to have more sense. Besides, the 
lucky winner could not claim his 
prize — if he tried we would all die 
of heatstroke.” 

“Attention, Pod Three. Are you 
stable and ready for thrust? Do you 
want to recheck your attitude?” 

“We h ave rechecked our attitude 
four times,” said Stone, glaring at 
Kirk, “and we’re as stable as we’re 
ever going to be. And anybody with 
half a brain knows that if we 
haven’t got it right we’ve no hope of 
reaching the — ” 

“Relax, Stone,” said Kirk 
nastily. 

“We’re firing — now,” said Stone. 

“Thank you, Three. 1 shall pass 
you the repositioning information 
in plenty of time for you to fire the 
braking thrusters at rendezvous. 
Pod Four, come in, please.” 

The operation was smooth and 
fast on Pod Four because Corrie 
had been listening to Mercer’s in- 
structions to the other capsules and 
had already worked out a close 
approximation of his pod’s firing 
attitude, so that only a few minutes 
spent on minor corrections were 
needed to position it accurately. 
The relationship between Mercer 
and the astrophysicist during the 
exchange of information was that 
of a pupil and a rather irascible 
teacher — and Mercer was not the 
teacher. Corrie did most of the 



talking until the moment he pushed 
the thrust button and his wife made 
a sound that would have been a 
scream if she had not been 
breathing in at the time — and 
pointed. 

“Don’t wave your arm about, 
dear,” said Corrie, “or you will 
cause a deviation in course. But I 
see what you mean.” 

“Having trouble. Four?” 

“Just an unpleasant surprise,” 
Corrie replied. “When we applied 
thrust the sidewalls bulged outward 
and the locksection forward looked 
for a moment as if it would come 
down on our heads. Actually it 
approached by only a few feet and 
now that thrust has ceased, it and 
the sidewalls have returned to 
normal. But you might have 
warned us that this would happen. 
That was inconsiderate of you, 
Mercer.” 

Corrie waited for more than a 
minute, then said testily, “Mercer, 
did you hear me?” 

“I heard you, Four. Sorry about 
that. Was there any indication of a 
swing off course when it hap- 
pened?” 

“No deviation,” said Corrie. 

“Good. Thank you, Four. Pod 
Five, come in.” 

AS CORRIE drifted away from 
the services panel he won- 
dered if he had detected a note of 
strain in Mercer’s voice. He was 
becoming quite familiar with the 
sound of the medical officer’s voice 
because, as was the case with the 
occupants of all the other survival 
capsules, it was the only outside 
sound he heard. He wondered why 
Mercer had waited before answer- 



DARK INFERNO 



139 




ing him. Was Mercer irritated be- 
cause a passenger had made a le- 
gitimate complaint at a time when 
he was very busy? Was he feeling 
as hot and uncomfortable as was 
Corrie and panting in the stinking, 
humid air as if he had just run a 
mile? Or was it simply that Mercer 
had been talking so long, repeating 
the same instructions over and over 
again, that he was going hoarse? 

But there was no way of escaping 
Mercer’s voice, so Corrie panted 
and sweated and listened to the 
medic being patient with the stupid 
ones and reassuring with the fright- 
ened ones and both at the same 
time with the majority of them. The 
only consolation was that Mercer 
seemed to be speeding up the pro- 
cess — while one pod was lining it- 
self up on its marker stars he had 
taken to giving the next two pods 
their attitude instructions. 

He ran into a slow patch between 
Pods Ten and Thirteen because the 
sun occupied the sky close to their 
markers on one side and the pas- 
senger wearing the goggles could 
not see the stars clearly and the 
others dazzled themselves trying 
and had to wait until their night 
vision returned. Mercer’s voice was 
quite loud during this period, prob- 
ably because the pods concerned 
were at extreme range for his radio. 

Corrie wondered why the other 
officers were not helping him, but 
then decided that Mercer’s radio 
was probably designed for this kind 
of work and it was his duty to look 
after the survivors while the other 
supermen did what they had to do 
about organizing the recovery. He 
had not spoken to any of the other 
officers and had seen two of them 



only briefly, but he recognized the 
type. They were the kind of men 
who were tops at their job, highly 
trained and even more highly in- 
telligent misfits who did not com- 
municate easily with normal 
people. 

Corrie understood them very well 
because he was that kind of person 
himself, a refugee in a do-it- 
yourself ivory tower. 

Possibly the injured captain had 
been less aloof. Corrie had heard 
a few words Mercer had not in- 
tended the passengers to hear 
before the medic had remembered 
to switch off, so Corrie knew that 
Collingwood was unfit for duty. 
Which was a pity because Colling- 
wood, judging by the way he had 
chatted with the passengers as they 
were coming aboard, might have 
been able to mix socially during the 
voyage. Or it might be that the crew 
was not allowed to have anything 
to do with the passengers — espe- 
cially female passengers — in the 
interest of discipline. 

Except for the ship’s medical 
officer, that was, who had acted 
like a glorified steward and not at 
all like a superman until the 
disaster had occurred. He could 
imagine the feelings of the .other 
officers toward the one who had 
free access, professionally and 
otherwise, to the passengers. They 
must have been knotted up with 
envy with people like the Moore 
girl undulating about the ship. Or 
did they sympathize with Mercer 
instead, looking down on him from 
their control-room monastery as a 
kind of worker priest whose duties 
placed him in the greatest danger 
of all, that of being blackballed out 



140

of the club if he made a slip? 

Mercer’s voice; “Pod Fourteen — 
come in, Mathewson. Twelve and 
Thirteen will need a little time to 
check their attitudes and you may 
need even more because of your 
small mass. I shall read your 
marker stars so that you can start 
lining up your vehicle now and save 
time when I come back to you for 
the final checks. Ready to copy?” 

Corrie cursed the heat and the air 
that would not stay in his lungs for 
more than a second, but not loudly 
enough to interfere with the con- 
versation going on between Mercer 
and the boy. When he was physi- 
cally or mentally uncomfortable he 
had a tendency to lash out at people 
or, if they were not within lashing 
distance, to think nasty thoughts 
about them. 

It was quite possible that Mercer 
was passing on instructions from a 
book. The medic’s treatment of the 
boy was, on the surface, completely 
unsympathetic. But Corrie knew 
that he was judging the situation by 
only one half of a conversation. If 
he could hear the other half he 
would know how thoughtless Mer- 
cer was being toward the boy — or 
otherwise. Certainly there was no 
indication in the half Corrie could 
hear that the boy was frightened or 
hysterical or unable to handle the 
job properly. Perhaps Mercer’s 
half of the conversation was simply 
a ruse to fool the boy’s mother into 
thinking that everything was going 
well with her son. Maybe the ma- 
jority of the instructions to the pas- 
sengers were like that and most of 
the pods had been unable to take up 
their proper pre-burn attitude and 
would never reach the rendezvous 



point. Not everyone was as well- 
informed as Corrie, after all, and 
even he could not be absolutely 
sure that he had done the job pro- 
perly. 

Corrie tried to bend his mind on 
to a more pleasant line of thought, 
an almost impossible task with 
Mercer’s voice dinning in his ear 
every few minutes. If he could not 
close his ears at least he could look 
out of this hot, stinking hell at the 
cold, clear beauty of the stars. But 
the transparent plastic was smeared 
with condensation in several 
places — the first time he had known 
that to happen — and the only heav- 
enly body he could see clearly was 
that of his wife. 

V IEWED objectively it was not 
a heavenly body in any sense of 
the word, but then Corrie had been 
unable to regard it objectively in 
the thirty years he had known it. In 
the beginning, when it had been 
rounded and firm and very much 
younger, he had loved it so much 
that it had been impossible for him 
to feel any objectivity about it and 
when the years began to pass and 
the structure changed and thick- 
ened as it adapted to the changes 
brought about by childbirth, he had 
not wanted to be objective. Neither 
could he be objective when the 
muscle tone began to diminish and 
his heavenly body had begun to sag 
and wrinkle and grow lined under 
the triple forces of age, gravity and 
grief. 

He thought of their daughter on 
the way to that dance, impaled like 
a beautiful butterfly on the steering 
column of her car — and decided 
that it was much more pleasant to 



DARK INFERNO 



141 




think about his wife and their cur- 
rent predicament. He had gone 
after, and gained, a very important 
post on Ganymede Base so that his 
wife would be able, if not to forget, 
at least not to be constantly re- 
minded by well-meaning friends of 
the tragedy. She would keep her- 
self busy teaching in a technologi- 
cally advanced village school with a 
dome over it, and the prospect had 
already made her begin to relax. 
The absence of gravity had 
smoothed out a lot of her wrinkles 
as well and she was certainly look- 
ing much better than she had for 
years. 

Corrie reached out to touch her, 
then stopped. It was not simply 
that putting his hot, moist hand 
on her would be uncomfortable for 
her and cut down the area of evap- 
oration — there had always been 
this hesitancy about the first touch, 
the initial invasion of privacy. 
From the very beginning there had 
been this shyness about their want- 
ing each other and an awkward- 
ness about expressing their feelings 
— as if some hypothetical listener 
would make scathing remarks if 
they called each other by pet 
names. And so what had started 
as a joke to cover his shyness had 
gradually became for them the 
language of love. 

Like a dedicated astronomer tak- 
ing up a lifelong study specialty, he 
had made a close study of his 
heavenly body until he knew it 
thoroughly inside and out, knew its 
powers of attraction and the seri- 
ous perturbations it caused when, 
as frequently happened, it made a 
very close approach and variations 
of the two-body problem had to be 



worked out. But no matter what he 
did or how coldly scientific was his 
language at the time, the result was 
invariably the same — two close 
binaries going nova together with 
the release of considerable energy 
and heat. 

“Heat,” he whispered angrily, 
“is the newest four-letter word.” 

She opened her eyes and saw his 
hand a few inches from her face. 
Suddenly she gripped it and pulled 
him toward her. They bounced 
softly together and she wrapped 
her arms tightly around his back 
before she spoke. 

“I’m hot and sticky and not nice 
for you,” she whispered between 
gasps for breath. “Fm bothering 
you and it isn’t fair, but I’m afraid. 

I can’t breathe, George. I’m — I 
think I’m going to die.” 

“Don’t cry,” Corrie whispered, 
smiling, “you’ll increase the hu- 
midity. And you aren’t bothering 
me — it’s too damned hot to be 
bothered.” 

“It isn’t a joke,” she said, des- 
peration making her speak the 
first few words aloud, “I’m suf- 
focating. Every time I breathe out 
I don’t know if I’ll be able to 
breathe in again. I can’t stand it. 
My head is bursting and — and I’m 
drowning in here. I’m going to die, 
George.” 

“No you . won’t,” said Corrie 
quietly. “Try to think of something 
pleasant, like that time I stuffed the 
snowball down your neck. The heat 
is bad, but the suffocating sensation 
is all in your mind. We have plenty 
of air, remember — think of what it 
must be like in a pod with three or 
four people in it.” 

He broke off, gasping for breath 



142 



GALAXY 




and with big black splotches jerk- 
ing across his field of vision. It 
had been too much to say in one 
breath, but he had tried to do it 
because it had seemed the best way 
of proving to her that they were not 
short of air. 

A little later he went on, “Mer- 
cer has been talking to Pod Six- 
teen and nobody else for the past 
twenty minutes, so he will soon be 
finished. When he stops talking we 
can get some sleep. Try to relax. 
We have nothing to worry about 
and plenty of air,” 

you. Sixteen. That 
X completes the exercise, la- 
dies and gentlemen. We shall meet 
again at the rendezvous area in 
approximately six and a half days.” 
We hope, thought Corrie, then 
said out loud, “Why don’t you 
shut up and go to sleep?” 

“That was good advice, whoever 
it was who gave it. I agree, all of 
you try to sleep. With one excep- 
tion. Come in. Pod Four.” 

Startled, Corrie said, “Pod 
Four.” 

“We have been considering the 
incident — the only one of its kind 
to be reported — you mentioned 
during retro fire when your pod 
became uniformly deformed while 
thrust was being applied. We think 
you have a problem. Four. We are 
pretty sure that you have been 
punctured by one or more small 
particles of the ship and that you 
have suffered a drastic, but obvi- 
ously not lethal, pressure drop. 
The drop has been so gradual that 
you may have attributed your dif- 
ficulty in breathing to the heat, but 



the sooner you repair the leak or 
leaks the better. 

“You will find a tube of sealing 
compound, clearly marked, in a re- 
cess in the services panel. If you 
can’t read or understand the in- 
structions for any reason — anoxia, 
impairment of vision, anything 
like that — ask me. Otherwise do 
not waste time or oxygen acknowl- 
edging my instructions. 

“The punctures in the transpar- 
ent section of your pod will appear 
as patches of condensation. Closer 
examination will show that they are 
actually small clouds of water 
vapor boiling off into space. Punc- 
tures in the opaque area will be 
harder to find. Use empty food 
tubes, torn open and flattened. 
Cover the opaque area systemat- 
ically, using the opened tubes. The 
tube plastic is thin and will stick 
to any point where air is escaping. 

“Don’t try to take a short cut by 
covering a larger area with a piece 
torn from a plastic screen. You 
could easily miss a leak that way 
and the screen plastic is tough — 
you must avoid wasting energy 
when the oxygen level is low or you 
will pass out. Work carefully and 
thoroughly and with minimum ef- 
fort. If you haven’t asphyxiated al- 
ready there should be ample time to 
plug the leaks before you do and 
then, of course, you won’t.” 

Corrie was busy long before 
Mercer had finished talking and he 
did not have to ask for clarification 
or further instructions. He spoke 
only briefly to give directions to his 
wife and, although they used 
minimum effort on the job, they 
completed it, feeling that they had 
been boiled in their own body 



DARK INFERNO

fluids. Corrie looked at their 
handiwork, six small blobs of seal- 
ing compound where three tiny 
pieces of Eurydice had come and 
gone and wondered what it would 
have been like to have been hit by 
one of those tiny, radioactive bul- 
lets. One of them, if he remembered 
his position correctly when the 
explosion had occurred, must have 
passed within inches of his head. 

“Pod Four,” he said. “Finished.” 

“Thank you. Four. Pressure will 
come up fairly quickly now, but Fm 
afraid the news isn’t all good. You 
have lost a lot of air and no longer 
have the fifty percent safety margin 
you started with. You are in the 
same fix as the people in three- 
passenger pods. But don’t worry 
about it. Rest and sleep as much as 
possible. And that goes for every- 
one.” 

Corrie drifted, eyes closed and 
feeling fractionally more com- 
fortable than he had felt for days, 
thinking about Mercer. The medic 
had known for hours that Pod Four 
was leaking air^ — the pause when 
Corrie had complained about the 
sudden flexibility of the walls dur- 
ing thrust had been Mercer report- 
ing to the other officers, no doubt. 
But he had not mentioned it to 
Corrie until the very end, after the 
pods carrying four and then three 
people had been turned around — 
the pods that would reach the 
rendezvous very short of air in- 
deed. If they got out of this, Corrie 
did not know whether he should 
compliment Mercer or punch his 
face. 

“The next time you tell me you’re 
dying, dear,” he said, “I’ll believe 
you.” 



The voice of Mercer kept him 
from hearing his wife’s reply. 

“Your attention, ladies and gen- 
tlemen. The radio interference 
caused by the ship blowup is be- 
ginning to fade and we have had a 
signal from Eurydice Control. The 
recovery ship took off three hours 
ago. It is on course and estimated 
to arrive at the pickup point in a 
little over a week. Now I’m going 
to sleep.” 



XVII 

H e was monitoring the pod 
frequency with the volume 
turned down and all he could hear 
was the faint hiss of interference 
and, very occasionally, a quiet 
voice complaining about the heat, 
the smell, the hunger or the other 
people in the pod. If something 
happened in the survival capsules 
that needed his attention, the qual- 
ity and tone of the voices would 
change enough to worry his sub- 
conscious into waking him up. 
Mercer had never felt so tired in 
all the thirty-two years of his life. 

But his fatigue was mental rather 
than physical — the only muscles 
that he had used had been those 
controlling his tongue — and his 
brain did not have enough sense 
to go to sleep easily. He had to go 
through it compartment by com- 
partment, switching off, powering 
down, forbidding it to worry or 
feel guilty or responsible for situa- 
tions and people over which he had 
little influence and no direct con- 
trol. And he, too, had to try to 
forget the heat and the hunger when 
it was within his power to ease both

conditions where he personally was 
concerned. 

Prescott, without actually for- 
bidding him to use the individual 
air-conditioning systems and stores 
for the bunks, had reminded him 
that he would need to save as much 
power and consumables as pos- 
sible for the transfer of passengers 
to the recovery ship. 

He tried not to worry about what 
might happen at the rendezvous — 
if his segment reached it or if the 
recovery ship reached it. There was 
nothing he could do for the cap- 
tain either — Collingwood’s treat- 
ment was palliative rather than 
curative. Nor could he be of any 
real help to the passengers, save 
as an eavesdropper who could 
head off a panic or a potential 
fight by giving the offending parties 
something else to think about. Ex- 
cept for the Mathewsons, Stone 
and Miss Moore they were simply 
names and voices to him for the 
most part — he had not had enough 
time to fix them in his memory as 
individuals. 

As Mercer drifted loosely above 
his couch, the soporific hiss of 
interference and the occasional 
murmuring of passengers’ voices 
reinforcing the humming of his 
segment’s life-support equipment, 
it became increasingly difficult 
for him to separate the real sounds 
from the ones he dreamed and al- 
most impossible to tell them apart 
when his dreams began to use real 
sound effects. But he could recog- 
nize the voices, even when they 
were slurred with fatigue, dis- 
torted by anger or segmented and 
separated by long, gasping pauses 
for breath. 



The remembered voice of Pre- 
scott built itself up from the back- 
ground noises, telling him that 
the passengers could not pos- 
sibly be as short of air as they 
sounded — not even the ones who 
were four to a pod — and that the 
gaspings were due to unnecessary 
exertion, heat and thinking too 
much about a shortage of air that 
had not yet happened. That, of 
course, had been before Mercer had 
reported the deformation of Pod 
Four during thrust and Prescott 
had decided that the Corries’ short- 
age of breath was actual rather 
than imagined. 

Mercer had wanted to tell Four’s 
occupants as soon as possible 
about their trouble. Prescott had 
objected, saying that doing so 
would unsettle the passengers who 
had not been turned around by 
delaying their retro fire and making 
them wonder if their own pods were 
not Just a little bit soft. Telling the 
Corries too soon could quite easily 
have brought on another six 
emergencies just like theirs. When 
Mercer had continued to argue, 
Prescott had ended by asking him 
to wake the captain for a second 
opinion. 

“No,” said Mercer, because the 
captain, dressed only in sweat- 
soaked bandages, was feeling his 
way around the segment. Where 
Collingwood’s spacesuit had not 
pressed tightly against his skin, 
the decompression had caused 
capillary bleeding and the blood 
had congealed so that his face and 
neck were like one great, livid 
bruise and the same angry dis- 
coloration marched along his 
body and limbs in broad, regular 



DARK INFERNO 



145 




bands. He kept looking straight 
at Mercer with his eye bandages 
and smiling and asking for a report 
and offering to help. 

Mercer said, “No,” again be- 
cause it did not much matter what 
he said to the captain in a dream. 
He told Collingwood that he could 
do nothing to help if he could not 
see, because Mercer’s greatest fear 
was that he had misdirected the 
segment so that they would never 
make rendezvous and that the 
captain’s instructions and those 
of Prescott would probably be in 
conflict. In any case the captain 
was a patient, and doctors were 
not supposed to worry patients 
with their physicians’ personal 
troubles. 

The captain replied that he was 
dying from radiation poisoning 
even though neither of them 
would admit it while they were 
awake, that he was so full of 
sedatives that he was walking in 
someone else’s sleep, and didn’t 
Mercer want company? Mercer 
insisted that the captain would 
make worse even his dream condi- 
tion by moving around and talking, 
that the radioactive material he had 
inhaled could easily be dislodged 
and start burning another area of 
lung tissue. 

But the captain remained hang- 
ing there, talking politely and re- 
fusing to return to the bunk, which 
he could not possibly have escaped 
from in the first place. Mercer 
wondered if he could dream Col- 
lingwood back into the bunk or if 
he would have to dream himself 
awake and push Collingwood into 
the thing. But if he dreamed him- 
self awake he might really awaken. 



Mercer did not want to wake 
for as long as possible. Sleep 
was infinitely precious — it short- 
circuited a few of the boring, 
anxious, sweating hours of waiting 
for rendezvous and rescue or for 
the realization that he was off- 
course with no hope of rescue. He 
would allow the captain into his 
dream provided Collingwood did 
not become too unpleasant — it 
would be a small enough price to 
pay for sleep. But he could not help 
wishing that his dream did not 
take over where his waking life 
left off. 

G radually coiiingwood’s 
intent, bandaged face began 
to fade away as did the bunks and 
the segment structure behind it, 
and Mercer was hanging in a 
vacuum rimmed by stars. Voices 
were coming at him from a ring of 
tiny, plastic globes that hung like 
bubbles in a black ocean. 

I can’t. You know I never could 
sleep properly without you beside 
me — no, George, you’re too hot. 
Just — just hold my hand until 
I’m asleep. 

Your tiny hand is sweating, let 
me — 

You can’t sing, George, and 
you’re wasting oxygen . 

“I agree,” murmured Mercer, 
“on both counts.” 

It’s supposed to be cold and dark, 
they told us. But this is a black 
inferno. I keep wanting to tear a 
hole in the plastic and climb out 
— it would be worth asphyxiating 
Just to be cool for a few seconds. 

Take it easy, Sampson. If you 
did that you wouldn’t even have 



146

time to feel cool. You would de- 
compress, swell up and burst like 
a balloon stuffed with porridge. 
You wouldn’t look or feel nice. 

And you only have to look at 
Kirk herself to see what she means 
about overstuffed — 

There’s no need for cracks like 
that, Moore — I was simply trying 
to keep her from killing herself 
and us into the bargain. But 
maybe you would like to die, too, 
because you have nothing left to 
live for. Even when you nudge 
against Eglin he just pushes you 
away now. You must be getting 
desperate. Your cheekbones stick 
out and as for your gorgeous 
figure, we can count every rib. 
You’re skinny, Moore, and you 
can’t take it. That’s the trouble 
with beautiful and unstable crea- 
tures who live only for love — 

Listen, fatso, an overweight hog 
like you has no reason to talk 
about psychological instability. 
You’re not exactly an attractive 
sight yourself. You’ve three times 
more skin than you need and it 
flaps around like a — 

You bitch. You can’t leave me 
alone, can you? Well, just remem- 
ber that three can live and breathe 
more easily than four and the next 
time you’re drifting about trying 
to nudge Eglin and you come 
near me. I’ll — 

Shut up, all of you! You’re 
wasting air, and just getting angry 
generates physical heat, so cut out 
the squabbling, ladies. If you 
want to do things, lie quiet and 
think about doing them when we 
get back on the recovery ship, 
where there will be enough food and 
cool, clean air to let us do them 



without killing ourselves, right? 
If you think about it quietly you 
will let me go to sleep and dream 
about it. You might even go to 
sleep yourselves. As for you, miss, 
I don’t really believe that you 
would tear a hole in the skin, but 
your long nails worry me. Why 
don’t you chew them like I do? 
It’s a good way of augmenting your 
diet. 

“Sensible man,” said Mercer. 
“Always leave them laughing.” 
He wondered sleepily if biting 
the nails were a mild form of 
cannibalism. 

Eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-eh. Whi-i-n-n- 
g-g-g. Blam-blam-blam. Kerpow. 
Eh-eh-eh- bo-o-om. Charge! 

The Mathewson boy’s capsule 
was having another war. It did 
not sound like Indians this time or 
bug-eyed monsters — arrows, Mer- 
cer knew from recent experience, 
went whizz-thunk and rayguns 
simply hissed. This sounded like 
a group of assault commandos 
of Second World War vintage in 
the process of establishing a 
bridgehead on Pod Fourteen. 
Mercer did not object either to the 
noise or the occupation, because 
it was much better than listening 
to the boy trying not to cry for his 
mother and the visitors were not 
using up any of the food or oxygen. 
Besides, a battle of this magnitude 
would soon make Mathewson 
hoarse and the imaginative effort 
involved would put him to sleep. 

He hasn’t spoken for over four 
hours. Do you think our radio has 
packed in? 

You worry too much, Saddler. 
He’s probably sleeping. After all, 
he’s only human . 



DARK INFERNO

You don't really believe that, 
do you? I wonder where they 
found such a cold, unflappable, 
unemotional iceberg for a medical 
officer — 

Poker, anyone? Whist? 

We just finished a game. Cant 
you think of anything else, like 
what it would be like if we had a 
girl in here? 

We might not be able to do any- 
thing. I mean, that's a game that 
only two should play. 

Not always. It has been practiced 
as a group exercise on occasion. 

No dice, Saddler — Mercer would 
deliver a sermon much stronger 
than the one he gave somebody 
three days ago, warning us about 
abusing the energy reserves of our 
restricted world in the thoughtless 
pursuit of pleasure. And the doll 
herself would probably remind us 
that she had a husband — seven 
feet tall and broad in proportion — 
in another pod. 

But nobody could actually stop 
us, could they? I'm thinking about 
that paragraph on page twenty- 
three of the emergency instructions 
where it says, in effect, that any 
actions taken by survivors while 
adrift in a capsule are beyond 
the jurisdiction of any planetary 
government. We could get away 
with anything . 

Like cheating at cards? 

Don't be ridiculous — some sins 
are unforgivable. But he might be 
right, Saddler — we could be luckier 
than some of the others. A pack 
of cards doesn’t use oxygen and if 
things get really bad we can always 
eat them. 

Gin rummy, then? 

“Try patience,” said Mercer in 



his sleep. “That’s the name of this 
game.” 

I don't dislike either of you. Try 
to believe that and stop arguing 
over what I probably think about 
you — I'm thinking none of those 
things. It doesn't make any dif- 
ference to me that one of you is fat 
and the other thin — even less that 
one is polite and apparently 
thoughtful while the other is less so. 
I'm a PC widow with a wide ex- 
perience of being loved, hated, 
tolerated or ignored by a man who 
changed personalities at will. The 
only good thing about you two, as 
far as I'm concerned, is that neither 
of you change. 

That might not always hold true, 
ma’am. In the grip of strong 
emotion, such as love, even the most 
stable personality can undergo — 

Say what you mean. Stone, 
Given the chance you would be as 
much an animal as any other man. 

That kind of personality change 
is normal in those circumstances 
and doesn’t worry me. 

I should think not. My wife 
wouldn’t complain if I came home 
a different man every night. What 
happened to him, was he institu- 
tionalized or did he get airborne 
without an aeroplane? 

Shut up, Kirk . 

It doesn’t matter. You probably 
think it was fun. It was, in the be- 
ginning when he took PC only 
occasionally when he had to meet 
an important client and he thought 
it would help him swing the deal 
if he put on a complimentary 
personality. But then he started 
taking them more and more often 
— and experimenting — and for the 
last four years his personality. 



148 



GALAXY 




was so fragmented that it had made 
him impotent. But he kept taking 
more, several different kinds at 
once, trying to shock his mind back 
to normal. They told him that it 
didn’t work like that but he 
wouldn’t believe them. That was 
how he died. At a party — after 
taking five, one of which was a 
hallucinogen — it was that kind of 
party. But he didn’t commit sui- 
cide. Three of them got impatient 
to experience the drug under free- 
fall conditions. They were holding 
on to each other all the way to the 
pavement. 

Tough . 

Yes. indeed . 

It doesn’t bother me now. But 
you see why I don’t like or dislike 
either of you and why it is a waste 
of time fighting over me. Nothing 
could happen here anyway, but 
perhaps if I came to know both of 
you better on the ship — 

Stone might get to know you 
better on the ship, but I wouldn’t— 
my wife would be there. And I’m 
not all that sure that we’ll ever 
make the ship. That sanctimonious 
medic is conning us and you are 
likely to be the last woman I will 
ever meet. My personality isn’t 
very nice, but I’m likely to be the 
last man you will ever meet. For 
obvious reasons I’m discounting 
Stone, who probably couldn’t — 

Kirk, you’re trying to start a fight 
again and you’ll get it — on the 
recovery ship if I can wait that 
long— 

Please. Please don’t fight — 

i < ly^acARDLE,” said Mercer 
IVL urgently, “Neilson. Pre- 
scott. Wake up, MacArdle, and 



listen to me. I have to try some- 
thing but I need your help . .” He 
went on calling the communica- 
tions officer, outlining what he had 
to do and asking for instructions. 
But MacArdle did not answer and 
all he could see was the survival pod 
with Mrs. Mathewson and Stone 
in it with a great, organic zeppelin 
without a face — Kirk. But then the 
picture began to fade and the sup- 
ports of the bunk beside him began 
to show through. Something, some- 
body, was waking him up and he 
was actually glad. 

“ — and if you insist on babbling 
in your sleep, at least talk co- 
herently! Mercer! Prescott here. 
Come in, Mercer.” 

“Mercer.” 

“I think I caught the general 
drift, but tell me again what you 
want MacArdle to do and why.” 

Mercer began by explaining that 
he still wasn’t sure whether he 
had overheard some pod conver- 
sations or merely dreamed that 
he had. When Prescott curtly in- 
formed him that he had overheard 
the same conversations, Mercer 
came fully alert. 

Without giving Prescott a chance 
to speak again he concluded, 
“ — I’ve been listening to them and 
understand the type of personali- 
ties involved. With that background 
of PC trouble with her husband 
she can’t help feeling the way she 
does, but the other two should not, 
under those circumstances, be told 
that she has no strong feelings 
either way for them. If she said 
that she preferred one, fine — they 
might have a token scrap and some 
bad language. They might even 
injure each other while proving 



DARK INFERNO 



149 




who was the better man. But telling 
them that they are just the same in 
her eyes — well, they both have to 
prove to her as well as to them- 
selves that they are not the same 
and before they do I have to get 
over there and stop it — ” 
“Negative. Absolutely not. The 
segments and pods are all, we hope, 
heading for rendezvous. Making 
course corrections to bring your 
segment alongside Three is a much 
too complex operation at this 
stage.” 

“But MacArdle had the return 
courses ready as soon as we needed 
them. He must have a computer 
that could easily — ” 

“You’ve got one just like it, 
Mercer, but you’ve spent your life 
programing it with medical data. 
The answer is no.” 

“But they’ll kill each other.” 
“Talk them out of it, Mercer. 
There is nothing else you can do.” 

XVIII 

H IS trouble was that he could 
not talk to the passengers as 
individuals even though, on many 
occasions during the days that fol- 
lowed, he was sorely tempted to do 
so. 

On Pod Three it was Mrs. 
Mathewson who did most of the 
talking as she tried desperately to 
keep the peace. He learned much 
about her from the things she said 
—about the life she had so recently 
led, the pressures she had been 
under and the difficulties of bring- 
ing up her son in a home that was 
all too often a madhouse. Other 
survivors revealed things good and 
bad about themselves, but Mercer’s 



interests in them and his concern 
for their welfare was professional — 
Mrs. Mathewson and her boy he 
was beginning to like. If he wasn’t 
very careful he could find himself 
acquiring a readymade family. 

The thought was ridiculous, if 
pleasant. It seemed to come to his 
mind more often when he was 
asleep than at other times — and on 
some of those occasions he was able 
to do much more than talk to Kirk 
and Stone. One of the first things 
he usually did was forget his Hip- 
pocratic Oath, lose his temper and 
begin making medical repair work 
for himself. 

He had to remind himself that 
Mrs. Mathewson and her compan- 
ions were three reasonably normal, 
civilized people who would not have 
dreamed of hurting each other un- 
der ordinary circumstances. The 
trouble was that he could not talk 
to them directly, although it might 
have been done quite easily by call- 
ing for silence from everyone else 
and talking frankly about their situ- 
ation. But then he would remember 
that while the frank discussion was 
going on between the occupants of 
Pod Three and himself, everyone 
else would be listening to his half 
of the discussion — including the 
Mathewson boy and Kirk’s wife. 
Mercer did not want the boy to 
hear about the sort of things Kirk 
was saying to Mrs. Mathewson 
and the discussion might easily 
become the cause of violence in Pod 
Four as well. The trouble in Pod 
Three, like a virulent disease, had 
to be contained. 

So he talked to Three in general 
terms, telling cautionary tales, 
drawing comparisons between pod 



150 



GALAXY 




conditions and those on over- 
crowded Earth, stressing the impor- 
tance of self-control and the 
necessity for eking out the available 
resources for as long as possible. 
When the reactions from the pods 
— not just from Three — told him 
that he was beginning to anger 
them with his preaching he changed 
his approach. He began to talk 
psychology and discuss the well- 
known fact that individual mem- 
bers of certain species, when threat- 
ened with death or a lesser danger, 
sometimes displayed a tendency 
to seek to prolong their lives 
through their offspring either by 
protecting them against the danger 
or by seeking to produce more of 
them. This urge toward species 
immortality was an animal instinct 
that reasoning beings could easily 
overcome. 

From that he moved to debating. 
More accurately, he answered at 
length questions that had never 
been asked. The survivors could 
not hear anything but his side of the 
debate so they did not know who 
asked the questions Mercer was 
answering and when some of them 
asked good questions of their own 
he sometimes tried to answer those, 
too. But when the questions were 
difficult or potentially unsettling he 
pretended that too many people 
were talking at once and that he 
had not heard them. 

He knew from their reactions 
that most of them guessed he was 
getting at someone, and specu- 
lation regarding the identity of the 
unknown offenders grew rife. Pod 
Three knew whom Mercer was 
getting at, but Kirk and Stone had 
stopped talking to him or even 



cursing him. And Mrs. Mathewson 
seemed to realize that nothing 
Mercer could say at a distance of 
several hunred miles would be able 
to help her. 

That made two of them. 

“Some of the passengers con- 
sider me a nuisance,” he told Pres- 
cott during his next report, “others 
a constant irritant and a bore, while 
most of them show active dislike. 
But on Pod Three — well, every- 
thing 1 say now makes them angry 
with me and each other — the men 
that is. There’s going to be bloody 
murder in that pod if someone 
doesn’t make them see sense. Do 
you think you, as the most senior 
officer, could talk to them and — ” 

“1 know 1 couldn’t, Mercer. Nor 
could Neilson or MacArdle. We 
aren’t programed for that sort of 
thing. How is the captain?” 

“Still out. If I allowed him to 
regain full consciousness he would 
be confused — I’d have to explain 
everything that has happened in 
detail to him — and in considerable 
pain. It would not be fair to him 
and he might not be well enough to 
sound authoritative. But then, I 
don’t seem to be effective either, 
and the reactions of the other 
passengers — ” 

“Are you worried by what they 
think of you, Mercer? Don’t be. 
I’ve listened to some of the things 
they’ve called you — several varie- 
ties of sanctimonious unprintable, 
a blasted nag where conservation is 
concerned, a cold-blooded, imper- 
turbable zombie who apparently 
can’t even treat a boy with kind- 
ness. But why go on. I’m beginning 
to feel proud of you, Mercer.” 

“Thank you, I think.” 



DARK INFERNO 



151 




“However, I can help by giving 
your people something else to think 
about. MacArdle has computed the 
attitudes for the rendezvous retro 
burn, but it will involve your giving 
the passengers another lecture, 
ril give you the positions, marker 
stars and firing times in numerical 
order, beginning with your own, 
which will be first. Are you ready 
to copy?” 

“Ready,” said Mercer. 

“Before I give you the data ex- 
plain to them in your words, not 
mine, that for this burn the attitude 
is not as important as the timing. 
They must check their velocity as 
close as possible to the rendezvous 
point and if they make a small error 
in attitude it will cause only a cor- 
respondingly small lateral drift and 
we will be able to keep them in sight 
and pick them up when the recovery 
ship arrives — that is, of course, 
assuming that they have not made a 
major attitude error which will take 
them wide of the recovery area. If 
they burn their B thrusters too soon 
or too late they will stop short or 
overshoot and we may not be able 
to find them without the recovery 
ship’s radar — and by then their air 
could be gone. Do you want me to 
repeat this?” 

“No.” 

“The first burn, yours, will take 
place in a little over five hours. The 
two four-person pods will follow, 
then the remainder in numerical 
order, with the last few having 
nearly a day to practice their posi- 
tioning maneuvers. With luck a 
fair number of pods will be conver- 
ging toward visual contact shortly, 
which should also give your people 
something pleasant to think about. 



“Your burn will occur at twenty- 
two zero six and your marker stars 



D uring the hours that passed 
before Mercer had to make 
his burn, the reactions from the pods 
ran the gamut from wild excitement 
to the listlessness of utter despair. 
But morale improved considerably 
when Pods Ten and Twelve re- 
ported seeing another pod, which 
meant that they were seeing each 
other. Mercer did not tell them that 
their seeing each other so soon 
meant that one or the other was 
considerably off course. 

When the time came for him to 
apply thrust he had not seen any- 
one else, even though the other 
three crew segments had reported 
seeing each other and they should 
have been within easy visual range 
of him. Mercer tried to consider 
the possibility that he was off 
course, lost, and for a few minutes 
so great was his panic that he could 
not even think. But then he began 
to feel angry as well as afraid, 
angry with MacArdle for giving 
him such precise instructions when, 
if Mercer had not carried out the 
repositioning properly a week 
earlier, this present exercise was a 
sheer waste of time. He surprised 
himself by making the final attitude 
check and pressing the thrust 
button precisely on the pip. 

But when he moved to the canopy 
to make another desperate search 
of the stars for the three segments, 
the fear returned. He wondered 
again if he should rouse the captain 
— would it be fair to wake Colling- 
wood only to explain that due to an 



152 



GALAXY 




error on Mercer’s part they were 
lost and were going to die? It might 
not be fair — but, on the other hand, 
did anyone have the right to put a 
man to sleep, then make the condi- 
tion permanent without first 
waking him to tell him so? Maybe 
Collingwood would hate Mercer 
for waking him — or perhaps there 
were things Collingwood would 
want to remember for a while be- 
fore he died. There was that start- 
lingly beautiful ground hostess who 
was the captain’s wife. 

“Where the hell are you?’’ Mer- 
cer shouted. 

“Prescott. Steady, Mercer. We 
could ask the same of you. Try 
lighting a flare.’’ 

Keeping his eyes covered to re- 
tain his night vision, Mercer ejected 
a flare, not daring to hope. 

“We have you, Mercer. Mac- 
Ardle says that from your position 
we should be midway between 
Triangulum and the Square of 
Pegasus, in visual range now that 
you know where to look. Well?’’ 

“I see you,’’ said Mercer after a 
few minutes. With thousands of 
stars all around him, the arrival of 
three small and not particularly 
bright additions had not been easy 
to detect. “Can I get closer?’’ 

“Yes, by using your flares for 
thrust. You ignite them without 
pressing the eject button. This 
causes them to burn inside their 
launchers. Each will give ten sec- 
onds of very weak thrust. But it 
isn’t necessary for you to come 
closer. We can expect some pretty 
wild shooting from the passengers 
and having you out there to look 
for stragglers could be an advan- 
tage and the recovery ship might 



come to rest closer to you than us.’’ 

“I understand.’’ 

“It’s nice seeing you, Mercer. 
Now you had better attend to Pod 
Five.’’ 

On Pod Five Eglin had passed 
out from heatstroke and the three 
girls had positioned the capsule 
and applied thrust. Mercer did not 
see their burn, nor those of Pods 
One and Two, but they were spot- 
ted by the other segments and he 
relayed the good news to their 
occupants. Several passengers 
reported excitedly that they could 
see other pods, and Mercer spotted 
one drifting almost directly be- 
tween himself and the dim constel- 
lation of artificial stars that was 
made up of the other three crew 
segments. He did not know who 
the new arrival was until its B 
thruster burned outward like a fiery 
spear precisely on the second listed 
for Pod Three. 

“I see you. Three,’’ said Mercer, 
laughing with relief. “Nice shoot- 
ing.” 

“Stone here. I’m not just a pretty 
face, you know. But this little mir- 
acle of astrogation is going to cost 
someone, Mercer.” 

“Fine,” said Mercer, laughing. 
“Company rules forbid the carry- 
ing of intoxicating liquor, but if 
you wouldn’t mind a few ounces of 
diluted surgical spirits I’d be glad 
to—” 

“He doesn’t want to be paid off 
in booze, stupid.” 

“That was Kirk, Mercer. Ignore 
him. He isn’t responsible for his 
glands.” 

“Don’t you patronize me, you — 
you gentleman — ” 

“Please don’t fight. We’re nearly 



DARK INFERNO 



153 




safe now. Please. Doctor, talk to 
them.” 

T here was nothing Mercer 
could say that would do any 
good, so he said nothing. There was 
little that he could do, but he did it. 

“Prescott. Are you in trouble, 
Mercer? There is evidence of a dis- 
charge of gas from your vehicle.” 
“No, sir. 1 used two contained 
flares to move toward Pod Three.” 
“1 told you to stay put.” 

“Yes, sir. But a very serious 
problem could arise on Three if 
something isn’t done quickly, and it 
is in my province. I guessed that 
you might object and 1 decided that 
it would be better — less prejudicial 
to discipline that is — if I were to be 
chewed out for using my initiative 
rather than for disobeying orders.” 
“That was considerate of you, 
Mercer. I suppose you consider 
mutiny just another exercise of in- 
dividual initiative? Don’t answer — 
I’m too busy just now to listen. 
Neilson will tell you what to do if 
you ever get where you’re going.” 
Before Prescott switched off 
Mercer could hear MacArdle read- 
ing out the numbers for what he 
called his final approximation of 
position while another voice, sibi- 
lant with distance and intervening 
interference, was reminding Pres- 
cott that the survival pods were 
nearing their limit of duration and 
suggesting ways by which the pas- 
sengers could save energy and air. 
The voice from Earth was speaking 
as if it were surrounded by mikes 
and TV cameras, as was probably 
the case. Mercer hoped that Pres- 
cott would give the ground-bound 
medic instructions on what to do 



with his elementary and unoriginal 
suggestions. 

The flares had not given his seg- 
ment much of a push. It would take 
five hours for him to reach Pod 
Three — if he did not go wide. He 
had three flares left, two for decel- 
eration and one to light if he got 
lost. It was extremely difficult to 
listen to the sounds from Pod Three 
without thinking too much about 
what might be happening there, but 
he tried. The voices from the other 
pods helped. 

“Pod Four, Corrie, at rest. 1 have 
two others in sight.” 

“1 can see someone! Pod Six 
here. Shouldn’t we decelerate?” 
“Pod Seven. We can see a pod on 
a converging course. Who is it?” 
“Mercer, the air is bad. When I 
look at the stars I keep seeing 
blotches. I’m not sure they’re the 
right ones.” 

“Pod Five. Sampson. The others 
have passed out and — and I’m 
going the same way. The air in- 
dicator is as — as near zero as 
makes no difference. Where the — 
hell’s the — recovery ship?” 
“Prescott. 1 heard that, Mercer. 
Tell her there is a safety reserve and 
to relax. Make it sound convincing. 
I’m going after them myself, estima- 
ting contact in five and a half hours. 
Is there anything special I should 
remember about reviving heat- 
stroke and asphyxiation cases?” 

“I can’t breathe, George.” 
“Crowded all of a sudden, isn’t 
it? I can see three of them, all drift- 
ing past us. It’s like — oh, God, no. 
We’re moving past them — we’re 
going right past them. Saddler here. 
What’s happening to us?” 
“Prescott. I see them, Mercer. 



154 



GALAXY 




Their attitude was badly off — they 
killed only a fraction of their in- 
ward velocity and are shooting 
away from the rendezvous area at 
a fair clip. MacArdle, go after them 
before they get too far away. Mer- 
cer, tell them to relax and play 
some more poker.” 

“Pod Fourteen, Mathewson. 
When will I be able to see some- 
thing, Mercer?” 

“Pod Nine here. We’re due to 
decelerate soon but we still can’t 
see anyone. Are — are we lost?” 

“I don’t think I’m the sort of 
man he keeps telling you I am — 
I’m pretty sure I’m not. But I don’t 
know for sure and I don’t want 
to hurt you. Even under this blub- 
ber I’m a big man, you know, 
and — well you’ve heard the expres- 
sion: laugh and grow fat. I think 
that fat people have to laugh to 
keep from crying or breaking things, 
and small people keep jumping 
about and prodding people so’s 
everyone will know they’re 
there — ” 

“Watch it, Kirk.” 

“ — in noise what they lack in

money or you put on weight after 
you’re married nobody will look at 
you but fat women. Just once be- 
fore I die I would like to be loved 
by a beautiful slim girl with a nice 
disposition and — well you know.” 

“I understand, Mr. Kirk. But we 
aren’t going to die and that wasn’t 
— isn’t how I’d describe myself. 



I’m a bag of skin and bones.” 
“Ignore him, ma’am. On you 
skin and bones look good.” 

“Damn you. Stone. You always 
have to say the right thing.” 

“Kirk, what are you doing — ” 
The fight started then and Mer- 
cer -would not reach them for 
another three and a half hours. 

XIX 

H e began by telling himself 
that it could not possibly last, 
that they could not maintain the 
physical effort in an environment of 
a stinking plastic oven full of rank 
air — but the fight went on and on 
with no audible indication of it’s 
ever stopping. Then he began to 
worry about the heat they were gen- 
erating and the air they were using. 
Reminding himself that both men 
were suffering from malnutrition 
and could well be as weak as kittens 
did not help much, because the 
noises they were making suggested 
that they were fighting like tigers. 
What they were doing was a physi- 
cal impossibility for sane men 
and insanity like theirs had to be 
temporary. 

But temporary did not necessar- 
ily mean of short duration. 

The grunts and gasps, the low, 
monotonous cursing and the wet 
thud of fists or feet against slippery, 
sweating flesh went on. Mercer 
told himself that his imagination 
was probably working overtime, 
that they were not seriously 
injuring each other because in the 
weightless condition it was practi- 
cally impossible to kick or punch 
accurately and, if a blow should 
land, both attacker and victim 



DARK INFERNO 



155 




would bounce away unless they 
were holding each other tightly — 
and if they were doing so they 
would not be able to punch or kick 
effectively. 

There was a sudden high, sharp 
squeal of pain. 

“Stop it! Stop it! Look what 
you’ve done to his ear — ’’ 

Animal noises answered her. 
Probably they were making them 
at each other. But there were other 
times when the noises became 
coherent words, when between the 
curses and grunts of pain they be- 
came all too specific about what 
they were going to do — what they 
M;ere doing — to each other. So 
there were very few blank areas in 
the mental picture Mercer had of 
the interior of Three and those were 
usually filled by the anguished 
pleading of Mrs. Mathewson trying 
to keep the two men from killing 
each other and her as well. 

“It’s getting hotter! Stop it. 
Please stop it — ’’ 

Mercer heard another wet thud 
and a feminine cry as Mrs. Mathew- 
son tried vainly to separate the 
men. Another scream was followed 
by a continuous whimpering and 
moaning as one of the men sank 
his teeth into the other’s shoulder 
and had his eye clawed while he was 
tearing free. Mercer knew what was 
happening because they kept talk- 
ing and gloating about it, but he 
did not know who was doing what 
because neither man’s voice was 
recognizable. 

Mercer had forgotten that in the 
weightless condition they could 
still use fingers and teeth. 

“Pod Ten. I’m having trouble 
again finding my markers. Is Arc- 



turus supposed to be level with the 
rod equator and Antares ten de- 
grees above it — or have I got it the 
wrong way around?’’ 

“You have fifty minutes before 
your burn. Ten,’’ said Mercer 
sharply. “I’ll come back to you. 
Quiet, everyone, for Pod Three.’’ 
“Prescott. Forget Three, Mercer, 
and think about your other passen- 
gers. Give Ten the information he 
needs. Right now.’’ 

“But those two are killing each 
other and probably the girl, too. 
Listen to them.’’ 

“I’m trying not to, Mercer. I 
advise you to do the same.’’ 

Mercer could not forget Pod 
Three because the sounds on the 
capsule frequency kept reminding 
him that the biting and clawing 
and gouging were still going on. 
But suddenly there was a marked 
reduction in the noise and activity 
—maybe the heat was getting to 
them at last and they were begin- 
ning to flag. With luck they might 
both pass out from heatstroke and 
stop using so much of the pod’s air 
— all the occupants might then sur- 
vive, even if two of them did not 
deserve to. 

A little over two hours were left 
before he rendezvoused with Three 
— if he were able to do so. 

“You’ve won, you’ve won. Let go 
of him. Can’t you see you’re strang- 
ling him?’’ 

“I’ve won. No. And yes.” 

“But — but you’re not angry any 
more and you’re still trying to kill 
him. Let go. Let go of his throat.’’ 
“Keep away. I’ll wrestle with 
you later — ’’ 

“Let go of him. Please let go — 
oh, my hair, my hair — ’’ 



156 



GALAXY 




“I told you to keep away—” 

Listening helplessly, Mercer 
knew that things were quieter on 
Three because one of its occupants 
was dead or unconscious. He could 
hear heavy breathing and the thud 
of blows being struck. Reminding 
himself that it was virtually impos- 
sible to land heavy blows in the 
weightless condition did no good, 
because he was remembering the 
girl’s long, dark hair and imagining 
one fist gripping a handful of it 
while the other pounded her into 
insensibility. 

“Pod Ten. Retro thrust com- 
pleted and I can see two other pods. 
I think one of them is close enough 
to wave to.” 

“Save your energy,” said Mercer 
dully.” 

T he sounds from Three were 
taking on a new quality because 
the purpose of the man making 
them had changed. His world might 
only have minutes of life left to it 
and he, whichever of the two it was, 
intended enjoying them to the full 
— the gasping, chopped-up mono- 
logue made that all too plain. But 
his intentions, which would have 
been easily accomplished on Earth 
where gravity kept inanimate or 
unconscious objects in one place, 
in his present environment required 
the active cooperation of both 
parties. One of the parties was un- 
conscious and could not have co- 
operated even if she had wanted to 
and he was becoming angrier, 
hotter and more frustrated by the 
second. 

Suddenly his breathing became 
stertorous. The sounds of cursing 
and the slapping contact of his 



body against the plastic stopped. 
He began to make choking noises 
and a few seconds later he was 
making no sound at all. 

Mercer swore horribly and 
turned up the volume on the pod 
frequency. The segment was sud- 
denly filled the sounds of heavy, 
labored, gasping breathing. It was 
coming from the fourteen other 
survival capsules and not, he was 
afraid, from Pod Three. 

“Prescott. I heard that, Mercer. 
You might be better advised to 
divert to Pod Four. The Corries 
could be shorter of air than they 
realize. MacArdle will give you 
the figures. Neilson will meet you 
and come aboard at Four — we’ll 
need to make some fast pickups by 
then and for that we need fast and 
fancy maneuvering.” 

“I have to check Three.” 

“I see. In that case MacArdle 
wants you to observe your target 
pod carefully and note the rate of 
apparent drift in the stars beyond 
it. This will tell him how much you 
are off course and allow him to 
compute an angle of thrust that will 
compensate for it during decelera- 
tion. Neilson will give you a run- 
down on the automatic docking 
sequence.” 

“I’m listening,” said Mercer. 
“When they’ve finished you 
should check on the captain’s con- 
dition — if you haven’t already done 
so. You are going to be very busy 
for the next ten hours.” 

“Will do.” 

But all at once Mercer did not 
want to check on Three’s drift, nor 
did he want to see the proof of the 
things he had heard going on, even 
though the sight might not be as 



DARK INFERNO 



157 




bad as his imagination had pictured 
it. Pod Three was in all probability 
a coffin that would never be opened 
— it might drift in space for all 
eternity, beyond even the range of 
Gabriel’s trumpet, unless he him- 
self went in and disordered the 
bones of its freshly dead. 

There was no real need for him 
to open that stinking, plastic coffin. 
The air must have been used up 
during that long, vicious fight and 
a man who had killed once by 
strangling his victim might lack the 
imagination during a stress situa- 
tion to vary his methods of coer- 
cion. Mrs. Mathewson could well 
have been dead before her at- 
tacker had succumbed to heat 
and asphyxiation. 

Mercer had been no stranger 
to the sight of death, whether nat- 
urally occurring or violent, but he 
was most desperately anxious not 
to see Mrs. Mathewson dead. For 
the first time he was able to under- 
stand why some people refused to 
look at the bodies of their nearest 
and dearest relatives. If one re- 
membered loved ones only as they 
were when they were alive, there 
was no real proof that their lives 
had ended. 

He could still call Prescott and 
change his mind. But then there 
was the boy to think about. Young 
Mathewson might not be as good 
at playing spaceman as he sounded. 
He might be headed wide of the 
rendezvous point and already con- 
demned to die. But he might not 
die — Mercer might have to tell him 
that his mother had died and he 
realized that, no matter how bad 
it was going to make him feel a 
few hours from now, he had to be 



able to tell the boy that she had 
died before he reached her pod. 

While MacArdle gave him in- 
structions he checked on the cap- 
tain’s condition and made sure that 
the services in the other bunks 
were functioning. Then Neilson’s 
voice filled the segment, interrupted 
only by passengers saying that they 
could see other pods and their air 
was running out, that it was very 
hot and when would the recovery 
ship arrive? People, Prescott in- 
cluded, were not giving Mercer 
much time to think, for which he 
was glad. 

As his segment was closing with 
Three he wondered what he would 
do if there were a survivor in the 
pod who was not the girl. He knew 
what he wanted to do, but a rebel 
bunch of brain cells in his mind — 
a minority group, but one that was 
steadily gaining converts — kept 
insisting that in different circum- 
stances Three’s occupants might 
well have become good friends. 
That the disaster of Eurydice had 
subjected two flawed personalities 
to a breaking strain and that an 
innocent one who had given no 
indication of being flawed had 
perished in the total calamity. 

W ITH MacArdle’s help he 
found him.self less that twenty 
yards from Pod Three and drifting 
slowly past it. Mercer had an air 
bottle and mask strapped in posi- 
tion, another set drifting loosely 
at his elbow and the inside seal of 
the airlock was already open. 
Through the window in the outer 
seal he could see Three turning 
slowly end over end like a great, 
fat cucumber, half silvered and 



158 



GALAXY 




half clear. In the transparent sec- 
tion he could see a motionless 
tangle of plastic screens, clothing, 
food containters and bodies float- 
ing like strange fish in a pink- 
tinged, frozen ocean. 

When Three’s lock turned to face 
his position he launched the auto- 
matic docking cable, watching its 
seeking head home on the lock 
transmitter, connect and begin 
drawing the two vehicles together. 
As the cable shortened the differ- 
ence in the two vehicles’ velocity 
set them spinning about a common 
center. By the time the lock inter- 
faces came together they were 
spinning quite fast — not enough 
to blur the stars, but enough for 
Mercer to feel the tugging of arti- 
ficial gravity. 

He checked that the passenger 
frequency was switched off and 
reported what was happening to 
Prescott. Then he opened the con- 
necting seals and went through. 

The centrifugal force was greater 
than he had expected so that he 
dropped not too lightly onto the 
services panel at the opposite end 
of the pod. It was covered with a 
sexless tangle of arms and legs and 
plastic debris, the whole mess splat- 
tered with sticky red discs of con- 
gealed blood, which a few minutes 
earlier had been drifting weightless 
in the incredibly hot and stinking 
air. The smell was forcing its way 
past his breathing mask so that he 
had to fight to keep from retching. 

Mercer began pulling the tangle 
apart, trying to separate and iden- 
tify the people. The sun whirled 
steadily around the pod, plunging 
its contents into darkness for a 
few seconds, then sending shadows 



crawling over the bodies. 

Two, both male, were covered by 
thick traceries of nail marks. It 
was as if they had been wearing a 
red embroidered body stocking 
whose pattern included a large 
“number of solid red flowers — the 
places where they had used their 
teeth on each other. Wet red 
patches showed on their scalps 
where hair had been pulled out — 
their ears were like raw meat and 
he doubted if one of them had been 
able to see at the end. Neither of 
the two men was sweating, nor did 
they bleed. 

Mrs. Mathewson was also bloody 
but the blood did not seem to be 
her own. She was at the bottom of 
the heap, her head under a piece of 
plastic screen — which also covered 
the air supply outlet — in what 
would have been an effective oxy- 
gen tent if the air being vented had 
not been only fractionally less foul 
than that in the pod itself. There 
were two large bumps on the right 
side of her skull, no depressions, 
and the side of her face and upper 
torso showed severe bruising. She 
did not seem to be breathing but 
her pulse, weak and rapid, was 
discernible. 

Mercer slipped the spare mask 
over her head and turned the air 
tap on full. He tried to inflate her 
lungs by moving her arms rhyth- 
mically away and back to her sides, 
but he had to be careful because 
she was so emaciated that he could 
actually see two cracked ribs. The 
pulse began to slow and stengthen 
although she showed no sign of 
regaining consciousness. 

He was dizzy from a combination 
of the stench, the heat and sheer 



DARK INFERNO 



159 




relief. Quickly and carefully he 
strapped on her air tank, checked 
the mask fastenings and lifted her 
in his arms. He bent at the knees 
and jumped for the lock seal eight 
feet above his head. 

The services panel gave under his 
feet. He found his mass not lined 
up properly with his center of 
thrust and began a slow somersault. 
Although the centrifugal force was 
weak, it was still strong enough 
to bring him to a stop three feet 
short of the seal and he began to 
fall back slowly. When he landed 
Mrs. Mathewson still in his arms, 
the pod stretched alarmingly. Its 
walls closed in and for an awful 
moment Mercer thought that the 
plastic would rupture and burst. 
But slowly the capsule resumed its 
proper shape. Mercer tried again. 

This time he did not jump im- 
mediately but instead made a series 
of knee flexings which set the pod’s 
floor to bouncing slowly in and out 
and its walls to pulsing like some 
alien artificial heart. He could 
hardly see through the sweat pour- 
ing into his eyes and he knew that 
if he gave in to the urge to be sick 
he would gum up his breathing 
mask and probably suffocate or 
collapse from heat prostration be- 
fore he could get it cleared. So he 
persisted, reinforcing the up-and- 
down movement of the services 
panel until regular contractions 
threatened to bounce him away, 
then he jumped during one par- 
ticularly strong upswing. 

“The girl is all right,” he re- 
ported, back in his segment. He 
hardly recognized his own voice. 

“Good. I didn’t really think that 
the air would last.” 



“It lasted,” said Mercer, “be- 
cause the other two had stopped 
using it.” 

“In that case leave them and 
mark the pod. Seal up and prepare 
to break contact. But before you 
do, MacArdle says he can utilize 
your present spin to boost you 
toward Neilson and Pod Four. It 
could save a lot of time and the 
Corries have very little time left. 
I am closing with Pod Five now 
and will be too busy to talk to you 
for a while, so I’ll give you 
MacArdle — ” 

“Before you open the seal,” said 
Mercer, “take two antinausea 
tablets and plug your nostrils with 
cotton.” 

“I’m supposed to be giving the 
orders.” 

“Doctor’s orders,” said Mercer 
firmly, “you have to take.” 



XX 

O N THE way to the rendezvous 
with Neilson and Pod Four, 
Mercer had time to move Mrs. 
Mathewson into the bunk below 
the captain’s, carry out a proper 
examination and tape her broken 
ribs. She still had not regained 
consciousness but the reason, he 
was sure, was nothing more serious 
than a concussion. While he worked 
the last few pods were nearing the 
rendezvous area, and his speaker 
kept repeating the occupants’ com- 
plaints about the heat and shortage 
of air. Some of the passengers 
sounded close to desperation. 

After his few minutes in Pod 
Three, Mercer wondered why they 
were not raving mad. 



160 



GALAXY 




Suddenly the slow, deliberate 
voice of Neilson, relayed through 
Prescott’s transmitter, was filling 
his segment. 

“I’ll be docking with you in a few 
minutes, Mercer, but don’t open 
your seal until 1 tell you. The drill 
is that I push you close to Four, 
disengage, then let you reel them 
in as you did with Three. I’ll posi- 
tion you so that you will not have 
to worry about spin. When you 
have them aboard dump the pod 
and I’ll redock and join you. Got 
that?’’ 

“It sounds almost too easy,’’ said 
Mercer. 

After one unpleasant surprise 
when he opened the seal — his ears 
popped painfully because Four’s 
pressurization was dangerously 
low — it all went surprisingly easily. 
There was no centrifugal force to 
complicate the rescue, and the pod 
interior was uncluttered. Both of 
the Corries were barely conscious. 
It took only a few minutes to float 
them into the segment, toss a 
marker grenade with a five-minute 
delay into the pod, seal up and 
detach. 

Neilson’s segment moved in 
quickly, nudged the empty pod 
aside and locked on. 

Mercer turned to see Mrs. Cor- 
rie taking off her breathing mask 
while her husband stared through 
the canopy at the slowly shrinking 
shape of their capsule. Corrie gave 
a startled grunt when the transpar- 
ent section of the pod abruptly 
changed to a dazzling white. 

“A small explosive charge inside 
a bulb of white paint,’’ Mercer ex- 
plained. “It marks the empty pods 
so that we will know to leave them 



alone. But you two will be much 
more comfortable in bunks — ’’ 

“No,’’ said Mrs. Corrie, gripping 
her husband’s arm with both hands. 

“Excuse me.’’ Mercer slipped 
them each a hefty shot of sedative. 
As their eyes began to lose focus 
he said, “There is nothing to be 
afraid of, ma’am, not now. The 
bunks are designed for seriously 
ill or injured passengers and carry 
their own life-support and waste 
elimination equipment. They are 
cool and roomy — ’’ 

“How roomy?’’ asked Corrie. 

“If you are worrying about 
claustrophobia, don’t. You will be 
asleep and — ’’ 

Neilson arrived just as Mercer 
had decided that he knew what was 
really worrying Mrs. Corrie. Neil- 
son was wearing a shiny patina of 
sweat and his cap pulled well down 
over his eyes. Mercer greeted him 
briefly, wondering about the reason 
for the cap — then deciding that the 
visor probably shielded Neilson’s 
eyes while he checked marker stars 
close to the sun. 

He turned back to the Corries. 

“I suppose you don’t want to be 
separated after all you’ve been 
through,’’ he said. “That is quite 
all right — the bunks are big enough 
to fit two in a pinch. But I’ll have 
to increase the air supply.’’ 

Neilson made the necessary ad- 
justments and helped Mercer fit 
the already sleeping couple into 
their bunk. 

“I don’t approve of single beds, 
either,’’ Neilson said. 

“Head to toe like that there isn’t 
much risk of their suffocating un- 
less one puts a foot in the other’s 
mouth,’’ said Mercer. “But I think 



DARK INFERNO 



161 




I’ll leave the sides open and keep 
an eye on them anyway. It’s nice 
to see you, Neilson.” 

“Likewise, Mercer.’’ 

“Prescott. Delay your reunion 
celebrations, please. MacArdle has 
some figures for you.’’ 

A few minutes later Neilson had 
instructions for Mercer. 

“We have to reach Pods One and 
Nine as quickly as possible,’’ he 
said, removing the cover of Mer- 
cer’s thrust panel as he spoke, “and 
pushing you ahead of me will waste 
too much time. So I want you to 
apply thrust to your segment while 
I do the same with mine — that way 
we will approach the targets broad- 
side but much faster. Ignore all the 
pretty lights unless they suddenly 
turn red. Depress this stud when I 
tell you — I’ll give you a five-second 
countdown — and release it when I 
yell, ‘Cut — ’ The procedure is the 
same as it was with Three when we 
close with the pods, which are only 
a short distance apart. First let me 
get us properly lined up.” 

“Two pods in trouble?” Mercer 
reached for the switch of the pas- 
senger transmitter. “That’s six 
people — no, seven, because Ten has 
four aboard — and we do not have 
an unlimited number of empty 
bunks.” 

“Don’t touch your transmitter, 
Mercer,” said Neilson sharply. 
“Prescott has been monitoring 
that frequency while you were busy 
and I don’t want anything to dis- 
tract you until we’re on our way. 
Anyhow, you have established a 
useful precedent with the Corries.” 

T he passengers in Pods One 
and Nine were in no condition 



to object to being packed in two to 
a bunk — they were much too re- 
lieved at being able to breathe 
relatively cool air again and for the 
few minutes it took for the sedative 
shots to take effect Mercer let them 
assume that such overcrowding was 
normal. 

While he was dealing with them 
he could not help noticing the bunk 
temperature gauges — they showed 
the differential between the seg- 
ment as a whole and that being 
experienced by his patients. The 
new arrivals were generating a lot 
of extra heat. 

Before Neilson could rejoin Mer- 
cer, Prescott was on the speaker. 
MacArdle had more figures — Pod 
Six was running out of air. 

Neilson estimated that he and 
Mercer would need twenty minutes 
to reach Six. While they were on 
their way Mercer asked about Pod 
Eight, which had accelerated past 
the rendezvous and been chased by 
MacArdle. He had been out of 
touch and nobody had mentioned 
Eight recently. 

“That was quite a chase, Mercer. 
It will take me five hours to get 
back, but I have them aboard.” 

“Are they all right?” 

“Two of them are doing fine. But 
the other man, Saddler, is running a 
bluff with a pair of threes.” 

“Prescott. When you’ve dealt 
with Six, there are two other pods. 
Ten and Thirteen, that will be in 
bad trouble by then. Give Neilson 
their markers, MacArdle, or would 
you rather watch the poker game?” 

“How,” whispered Mercer, 
“does he know which pods are in 
trouble?” 

“He noted their positions as they 



162 



GALAXY 




came in,” said Neilson quietly, 
“and his telescope brings in the 
pods that went wide. From his 
position they have a wide angle of 
separation, so he lines up his di- 
rectional antenna on the telescope 
bearing. This increases the strength 
of any given pod’s signal and he 
knows who is calling for help even 
if they don’t identify themselves — 
or even if they are so short of air 
that they can’t speak.” 

“Do we have a dish antenna?” 
Mercer asked. “I was thinking that 
it might operate in reverse to allow 
me to speak to a pod without all the 
other pods hearing the message.” 

Neilson shook his head. “Only 
the captain’s segment has such re- 
finements and normally the dish is 
used to maintain two-way contact 
with Earth Control. But now Pres- 
cott is using it on the pod frequency 
because if Control and MacArdle 
haven’t done their calculations 
right there isn’t much point in 
wasting time talking to Earth with 
passengers in trouble only a few 
miles away.” 

“Suppose MacArdle or Control 
haven’t — ” began Mercer. 

“This segment, on the other 
hand,” Neilson went on firmly, 
“has no sophisticated communica- 
tions equipment, a relatively small 
fuel reserve and quite a lot of power 
and air reserves — a life raft, Mer- 
cer, is what we’re in.” 

“If I had known about the 
power,” said Mercer, “I might 
have wasted a little keeping the 
place cooler.” 

“You will be very glad that you 
didn’t,” said Neilson seriously. 
“This segment takes thirteen pas- 
sengers and a crew of two, com- 



fortably. So far you’ve squeezed in 
ten passengers and have saved on 
space because most of them have 
doubled up. Trouble is, you can’t 
double the air supply. Our segments 
have less, elbow room and can take 
three survivors in a pinch. How 
Prescott is managing with four I 
shudder to think.” Neilson paused. 
Then: “Why don’t you take a few 
minutes to visit my place? It’s 
through the airlock and then 
straight ahead. You can’t miss it.” 
“Are you trying to be funny?” 
Mercer asked harshly. “Or trying 
to humor me so I won’t ask awk- 
ward questions? Do you know when 
the recovery ship is due?” 

“If I did I might not tell you. You 
would only worry if it turned out to 
be a little late.” 

“I’m not completely stupid. If it 
doesn’t arrive exactly on time — 
that means it has gone wide and 
won’t arrive at all. That is so, isn’t 
it?” 

Neilson did not reply. Instead he 
cocked his head to one side and 
said, “One of your patients wants 
out.” 

T he captain was tapping the 
inside of his bunk and growing 
audibly more impatient with every 
passing second. Mercer started to 
say that Collingwood had no 
business being awake at all, then 
stopped because he realized that he 
must have missed giving his patient 
a scheduled sedative shot. He 
moved quickly to the bunk, opened 
the side and slid the litter out far 
enough to let him see what Colling- 
wood was doing. 

Mercer had another shot ready, 
but it would take a few minutes for 



DARK INFERNO 



163 




it to take effect — and longer if 
Collingwood tried to fight it. Col- 
lingwood had stopped tapping and 
was using his fingers to explore the 
bandages covering his eyes. 

He winced as the needle slid in, 
then asked sharply, “Who is that?” 

“Mercer, sir.” 

Neilson drifted to the bunk, gave 
a little sigh of sympathy as he saw 
the bandages, the lead shielding on 
Collingwood’s chest and side and 
the livid decompression blotches 
covering the captain’s body. He 
withdrew again without speaking. 

“I’ve lost count of the times that 
I have begun to come to,” said the 
captain, “and you’ve jabbed me to 
sleep again. I want out of this thing, 
Mercer. Even if I can’t see, I can 
still hear, speak and think, damn it. 
And I should be getting exercise to 
prevent muscle atrophy and . 
But you’re the doctor and should 
know all about that.” 

“Yes, sir,” said Mercer. “That 
has been attended to — you have 
been given gentle exercise and 
massage every four hours. But I 
strongly advise you to stay put, 
sir. Movement of any kind could 
aggravate your present condition.” 

“Which is?” 

The shot was showing no sign of 
taking effect and Mercer knew that 
the captain was demanding a con- 
dition report with an urgency that 
might delay the sedative’s action 
indefinitely. Through the canopy 
behind Neilson Mercer could see 
Pod Six growing slowly larger. He 
told the captain about his condi- 
tion, keeping it brief and to the 
point. 

“But you must have changed the 
dressings while I was sleeping,” 



Collingwood said when he had 
finished. “And presumably the 
damage caused by the dim light is 
no greater when I am awake than 
asleep. I want to know if I can see. 
Doctor. And while you are taking 
off the dressings you can tell me 
about the condition of your seg- 
ment, the other crew segments and 
the pods — ” 

He had other questions as well 
and there was still no sign of the 
sedative’s taking effect. 

Mercer looked appealingly at 
Neilson, who moved closer and 
began to answer the more technical 
questions as the last few layers of 
dressing were being removed. Mer- 
cer was relieved to discover that his 
segment was in good shape, pleased 
that Neilson thought him some- 
thing less than wasteful of its power 
reserves and surprised at the multi- 
plicity of activities of the other of- 
ficers during the times when Mer- 
cer had thought that he was the 
only one doing any work — reas- 
suring the passengers had been a 
very small job compared to that of 
organizing their rescue. 

When the bandages and pads 
were off Collingwood kept his eyes 
closed while Neilson went on 
speaking. 

Perhaps he was asleep at last, 
Mercer thought, or maybe he was 
just afraid to look in case there 
was nothing to see. 

“If opening your eyes feels as if 
it might hurt them,” Mercer said, 
“don’t do it. We’re turned away 
from the sun and the only light is 
coming from a pod about a half- 
mile away, so it may be too dim for 
anything at all to register — ” 

Collingwood opened his eyes 



164

then. In the dim light the whites 
looked almost as dark as the irises 
— they were still bloodshot — and 
smeared with cream. Mercer saw 
them twitch from side to side, then 
up and down. The captain sighed 
and closed them. 

“I can’t stay awake any longer,” 
he said, “and Prescott is doing all 
the right things. But a word of ad- 
vice, Mercer. Before you meet him 
again, shave — and for God’s sake 
put on some clothes — ” 

Neilson’s sigh of relief warmed 
the back of his neck as Mercer be- 
gan replacing the dressings, and the 
mental picture that he had been 
seeing of an ex-Captain Colling- 
wood, blind and with a lung burned 
out and probably cancerous, being 
led around by his beautiful young 
wife until she became his prema- 
turely aged widow, faded away. 

Suddenly he laughed and said, 
“He can see^ 

“Yes,” said Neilson, “but we’re 
due to decelerate in three minutes. 
You know the drill.” 

AT FIRST Mercer was sure that 
Prescott had directed them to 
the wrong pod, one that was al- 
ready marked empty. But when he 
opened the seal he discovered that 
the life-support system must have 
packed up only a few minutes ear- 
lier and that the pod’s interior was 
filled with a dense, stinking fog. He 
had to grope through the weightless 
welter of plastic screens, clothing 
and other drifting debris for some- 
thing that would feel like a human 
being. He found two of them near 
the services panel and pushed them 
gently toward the seal at the op- 
posite side of the capsule. 



The third survivor found Mer- 
cer, wrapping his arms tightly 
around his neck from the back like 
someone drowning. The breathing 
mask was knocked away from his 
face and suddenly Mercer was 
drowning, too, in air that had to be 
too foul to support life. He lost 
his bearings and presently could 
not even guess where the seal was. 
He kicked hard against anything 
solid or near solid with which he 
came in contact, sending his pas- 
senger and himself bouncing blindly 
between the plastic walls of the pod, 
and by sheer luck he found himself 
tumbling into his own segment, 
which was by then also filled with 
stinking fog. 

A few minutes later, while the 
active survivor was helping Mercer 
resuscitate the other two, Neilson 
put in his head and shoulders to 
say, “Prescott has another one for 
us. We’re already lined up. Seven 
seconds thrust, five seconds count- 
down. Your mouth is bleeding, 
Mercer.” 

While Neilson and Mercer emp- 
tied three more pods, the Mathew- 
son boy in Fourteen was given his 
marker stars and thrust timing. 
Fifteen and Sixteen were timed to 
arrive a few minutes later. When 
they came aboard the last batch of 
passengers said that Mercer’s seg- 
ment smelled worse than the pod 
they had just left, that it was much 
hotter as well and had he anything 
to eat? Mercer told them that talk- 
ing wasted air and tried to find a 
place for them where they would 
not be in the way during the next 
rescue operation — the last rescue 
operation, Mercer was sure, be- 
cause his segment and its services 



DARK INFERNO 



165 




were becoming dangerously 
overloaded. 

Neilson had locked his control 
panel against accidental activation 
and placed three passengers in 
his segment. Two more drifted 
between the connecting seals, their 
feet in the engineer’s vehicle and 
their heads in Mercer’s segment. 
The bunks now held eighteen and 
the spaces between accommodated 
another two. Neilson and Mercer 
were pressed against a canopy that 
was virtually opaque with 
condensation. 

From time to time they rubbed it 
with sweating hands to search the 
blurred stars for the recovery ship. 
Despite everything that Mercer told 
them about conserving energy and 
air, the passengers were beginning 
to argue and push and ask why two 
of the bunk sides were still up when 
all the others were down and con- 
tributing their quota of air to the 
rest of the passengers. The occu- 
pants of the bunks, whose original 
sedative shots were beginning to 
wear off, had begun to complain 
about being hot and cramped and 
unable to breathe while the people 
outside were angrily offering to 
change places with them. 

“Those two bunks contain pa- 
tients as opposed to mere sur- 
vivors,” said Mercer sharply. 

“Neither of them is pleasant to 
look at and one of them, the cap- 
tain, is slightly radioactive. .” 

He went on to describe the cap- 
tain’s injuries in detail, the recovery 
of his sight and his poor chance of 
survival if some method of remov- 
ing the two specks of radioactive 
material in his lung were not dis- 
covered within the next few weeks. 



Medical facilities on board the 
recovery ship would be no better 
than those on Eurydice — and if 
Collingwood could not be treated 
soon he would probably outlive the 
voyage by only a couple of years. 

As he continued talking Mercer 
knew that he had their undivided 
attention and realized once again 
why morale was always good in a 
hospital ward — suffering shared 
was suffering halved and someone 
always seemed in poorer shape than 
oneself. Mercer was also doing his 
best to take the survivors’ minds 
forward to the time when they would 
be in the recovery ship and past the 
time in the not too distant future 
when the ship might or might not 
arrive. 

There was an interruption. 

T he first officer was trying to 
give them something else to 
think about as well. 

“Prescott. Switch on your pod 
frequency, Mercer.” 

Mercer pushed between two 
passengers to do so and heard the 
Mathewson boy’s voice. 

“ — didn’t answer last time be- 
cause Mr. Prescott said you were 
busy with passengers, but you can 
talk to me now. Pod Fourteen retro 
burn complete and I can see two 
other pods — ” 

“Prescott. We have him.” 

“ — and one of them is all white. 
What do I do now, Mercer?” 
“Nice shooting, Mathewson,” 
said Mercer warmly. “We have you 
in sight. Your orders? Well, keep a 
sharp lookout for the recovery ship, 
but don’t look at or near the sun 
without goggles. Acknowledge, 
please.” 



166 



GALAXY 




“Pod Fourteen. Will do.” 

But the concern of the passengers 
for the captain and their relief at 
the Mathewson boy’s safe arrival 
in the rendezvous area were short- 
lived. Soon they were saying that 
the boy was lucky to have a pod’s 
air and food supply all to himself, 
that the recovery ship was not 
coming, that it would be impossible 
to see it if it did come with the 
canopy fogged with condensation, 
that it was hot and that if some 
unprintable didn’t keep his feet 
out of someone else’s mouth he 
would get them bitten off. 

“You must understand,’’ said 
Mercer, trying not to gasp between 
words, “that we and the other pods 
and segments are following our 
original course for Ganymede and 
will arrive exactly on time. The 
recovery ship is virtually identical 
to Eurydice except for the extra 
boosters that will enable it to catch 
up with us and decelerate to match 
our velocity and which also make 
it impossible for it to be manned — 
no human being could survive the 
enormous acceleration. These 
boosters are very powerful and if 
they are fired in the rendezvous 
area we, or some of us at least, 
might suffer even more from the 
heat they generate. So the recovery 
ship has got to feel its way in, 
guided by the first officer, and the 
time of arrival is dictated by con- 
siderations of survivor safety. It 
could be only minutes away, or a 
couple of hours. Isn’t that so, 
Neilson?’’ 

The engineer rubbed at the 
canopy condensation with one 
hand. Three fingers were outspread 
with the thumb bent inward, in- 



dicating three, possibly three and a 
half hours. 

Aloud he said, “That is an over- 
simplification, Mercer, but essen- 
tially correct.’’ 

His expression, which only 
Mercer could see, was sayig: Lies, 
all lies. 

Three or more hours, Mercer 
thought. He asked, “And we have 
ample air and power to last out?” 

“Yes, of course,” said Neilson, 
but his expression had not changed. 

Nobody spoke for a few minutes, 
but Mercer knew that they would 
speak soon. He wiped sweat from 
his forearm and saw fresh globules 
grow seconds later. He had never 
been a compulsive extrovert, had 
never enjoyed the shouting, sweat- 
ing proximity of his fellow men. 
He knew with an awful certainty 
that he could not take much more 
of the present situation and that he 
would probably be the one who 
started the chain reaction of vio- 
lence for the simple reason that he 
had either to get out of this or end 
it. 

The heat and humidity were 
worse in his segment than they had 
been in many of the pods he had 
entered. He could understand how 
Kirk and Stone had felt, although 
their original reason for fighting 
had been much stronger, if not 
better, than his. He had to get out 
or he wanted all the other quarrel- 
ing, stinking people to get out. 

He suddenly realized that he 
could put them out, although not 
literally. 

“Mr. Neilson and I will have to 
sweat it out,” Mercer said, forcing 
a laugh so that they would all know 
that he was making a joke. “But 



DARK INFERNO

there is no necessity for the rest of 
you to share our discomfort. What 
I am proposing is not in accordance 
with company regulations, of 
course, which state that medical 
stores should be used only on pas- 
sengers who are ill or injured. 
Apart from being hungry and a 
little short of breath there is noth- 
ing wrong with you people, but you 
would be still more comfortable 
if—” 

“If the air is so scarce,” said a 
man beside him in a voice close 
to hysteria, “why the hell are you 
talking so much?” 

M ercer closed his eyes, 
fighting a sudden and incred- 
bly violent urge to batter the hate- 
ful, unshaven face and hunger- and 
heat-emaciated body until it looked 
like the two he had left in Pod 
Three. But he knew that once he 
started he would not be able to 
stop with this one stupid, sarcastic 
passenger — he would go berserk 
among them until all were quiet 
and probably all dead. He won- 
dered why he was having these in- 
tensely violent thoughts, was once 
more assailed by the heat and the 
stench and the sweaty pressure of 
bodies all around him and decided 
that he was in hell and that in hell 
everybody acted like the devil. 

“If I talk everyone else listens, 
sir,” he said, opening his eyes, “and 
that saves more air than if everyone 
talks. What I intend to do is give 
some of you the opportunity of 
taking special shots — a form of 
mild sedative, really, that also 
opens the pores and makes you feel 
cooler. I will use a spray injection 
hypo, which is quite painless. If 



you’ll give me just a moment I’ll 
demonstrate — ” 

Not all he told them was a lie, 
assured himself cynically. The shots 
were painless and the recipients 
would feel cooler and more com- 
fortable because they would be out 
cold for the next three hours. And if 
he pretended that there were not 
enough shots to go around and that 
he was doing them a favor they 
might not resist the idea until it was 
too late. Certainly the first three 
did not resist, possibly because he 
had led them to believe that he was 
still demonstrating the painless- 
ness of the procedure and nothing 
else. Still talking reassuringly, he 
injected any arm or thigh that 
presented itself. 

He looked at Neilson, who 
nodded and wriggled alongside 
him and began moving the suddenly 
relaxed bodies out of the way, hold- 
ing the ones who argued or tried to 
break free and closing bunks so that 
Mercer could reach the passengers 
in the lower tiers. 

Only one passenger, the last one 
of the three packed into Neilson’s 
segment, put up any resistance. 

She said, “We’re not going to 
wake up again, are we?” 

“No, ma’am,” said Mercer, “at 
least not in here.” Silently he 
added, We hope. 

A few minutes later Neilson 
gently cleared the space above his 
panel of drifting bodies and said, 
“Putting them out was a good idea, 
Mercer. I’ve rechecked my calcu- 
lations and provided we don’t waste 
air in needless discussion, we might 
just make it.” 

“Fine,” said Mercer. 

“I’m not trying to tell you your 



168 



GALAXY 




job, Mercer,” he went on, “but you 
might have to use a little energy 
checking that these sleeping beau- 
ties don’t drift too close to each 
other and smother. Or have you 
that under control?” 

“Yes.” 

“It’s hot.” 

“Yes.” 

“About the captain, Mercer. I 
should have told you earlier, but 
the passengers were so interested 
in his troubles that I didn’t want 
to spoil things for them. We re- 
ported what you said about his 
condition before Eurydice blew 
and the recovery ship will be carry- 
ing the special instruments you 
need to operate on him and with- 
draw the radioactive materials.” 
“That’s great.” 

“Prescott will be acting captain 
for the rest of the trip out and back 
— Collingwood won’t be able to 
assume command again until he 
has passed the Earthside medical. 
Prescott should have been captain 
anyway, but the company thought 
that he lacked charm for a pas- 
senger-ship skipper and put Col- 
lingwood in with Prescott to keep 
him right. The captain was strictly 
a station shuttle man — a nice per- 
son, but the situation wasn’t fair to 
Prescott. He is tops in this pro- 
fession, but he needs something — ” 
“A good PR man?” 

“Yeah. But we shouldn’t waste 
air talking all the time.” 

“You are doing most of it.” 
“Listen, Mercer, are you asking 
for a punch in the — ” 

“Prescott. The remaining pods 
seem to be in no immediate danger 
with the exception of one. There is 
a life-support system failure with 



toxic wastes escaping into the living 
space. This is an urgent one, Mer- 
cer. Can you squeeze in three 
more?” 

T he three survivors were se- 
dated just as soon as Mercer 
was sure that they were still alive. 
Then he burrowed and pushed until 
he found spaces for them and re- 
turned to the canopy to rest for the 
effort of burrowing in again a few 
minutes later to make sure that 
nobody was smothering. That 
effort increased the heat being 
generated inside the segment and 
the precaution did not seem to be 
really necessary. Twice he nearly 
passed out and once he almost 
panicked. Only the thought of Kirk 
as he had last seen him saved Mer- 
cer from tearing and kicking at the 
bodies pressing in all around him. 

In a way Kirk’s reaction had been 
normal. He had known that he was 
going to die and had decided to 
enjoy himself first. But the hot, 
intimate contact of flesh did not 
stir Mercer even though, like Kirk, 
he was sure that he was going to die 
shortly. He began to wonder why — 
was something wrong with him? 
But then he began to realize that all 
there was wrong with him was a 
recently contracted and serious 
case of monogamy — the only close 
contact he wanted or would enjoy 
would be with the patient in bunk 
Three. 

He did not go among the passen- 
gers again, but stayed close to the 
canopy, fighting for every breath 
and sweating from every pore. This 
atmosphere is unsuited to human 
life, he told himself, so why don’t 
we all die? But they did not die and 



DARK INFERNO 



169 




some of the passengers seemed to 
be moving, waking up — but it was 
only Neilson pushing his way 
through to the canopy. 

“1 thought it might be cooler 
here,” he said. “It isn’t.” 

Mercer wiped at the plastic with- 
out speaking. 

“I feel like a living fish in a can 
of sardines,” said Neilson, then 
added: “Sorry, I’m talking.” 

The silence stretched for a sweat- 
ing, stifling eternity and when it 
was broken the voice was not using 
the segment’s precious air. 

“Pod Fourteen, Mathewson. 
Come in, Mercer.” 

The voice was without expres- 
stion, just like that of a real space- 
man in an emergency. Mercer 
wondered what had gone wrong in 
Fourteen and if he could squeeze in 
one more. It would have to be a bad 
emergency for the medical segment 
to be a sanctuary, but it was only 
right that a mother and son should 
be together at the end. 

“Mercer,” he said. 

“I — I have visual contact with 
the recovery ship, Mercer.” 
“Prescott. Confirmed. MacArdle 
will have the figures for you in — ” 
They lost Prescott for a few min- 
utes then because the Mathewson 
boy had lost control and was 
whooping like an Indian, and Neil- 
son and Mercer were joining him. 

XXI 

T he recovery ship differed from 
Eurydice in that it had two 
passenger locks aft instead of one, 
a feature designed to speed the 
reembarkation of survivors. Neil- 
son nudged Mercer’s segment 



against one and used the other to 
dock his own vehicle, but it was a 
very close thing. Mercer’s head 
was pounding and throbbing and 
black splotches were blotting out 
his vision when he hit the quick- 
release on his seal. Then the hot, 
putrid air was rushing past him and 
cool, dry air began seeping back. 
He crawled out, shivering, to find 
Neilson already waiting for him. 

“We’ll have to go after the 
others as soon as possible,” Neilson 
said briskly. “Do you mind if I 
don’t help you unload this bunch? 
If I can concentrate on replenish- 
ing your segment with power cells, 
air tanks and fuel cartridges we 
could be ready to go in thirty 
minutes.” 

Mercer nodded. He began mov- 
ing out the sleeping passengers and 
floating them carefully into the 
main compartment, which now 
seemed to be enormous. He began 
with the people in Neilson’s seg- 
ment because it had to be jettisoned 
to allow Prescott, who was esti- 
mating contact with the recovery 
ship in twenty minutes, to dock. 
MacArdle and his passengers were 
due a half-hour later, b^y which 
time Prescott’s segment would have 
been turned loose. Mercer’s vehicle 
was the one designed for fast 
rescue work as long as there was 
at least one trained astronaut 
aboard to fly it. 

The last two people he moved 
out were the captain and Mrs. 
Mathewson — these he took up to 
sick-bay. The place gave him the 
strangest feeling of disorientation 
because it was exactly the same as 
the place he had just left except for 
its fresh, newly minted look. On 



170 



GALAXY 




his way he saw the people drifting 
about the passenger compartment 
showing signs of animation. He 
checked his dive, letting Mrs. 
Mathewson, and these he took up to 
slowly ahead of him, while he 
spoke to them. 

The manual had told him what 
to say. He had read that particular 
section over and over again during 
the past two weeks as he might have 
scanned a fairy story he had never 
expected to come true. 

“Your attention, ladies and 
gentlemen,” he said. “As you can 
see, your couches are already ar- 
ranged in cruising mode and num- 
bered as were the positions in 
Eurydice. In the usual compart- 
ments you will find food and fresh 
clothing. Will you please go to your 
original couches, strap in, talk as 
much as you want to, but keep the 
center of this compartment clear. 
For the next few hours the ship’s 
officers will be bringing in the re- 
maining survivors and doing other 
necessary jobs and you may feel 
that you are being ignored, but 
things will soon return to normal. 

“By the day after tomorrow,” he 
added, smiling, “I may even be 
able to arrange a swim in the tank.” 

When he had completed his check 
on the captain, he replaced the 
blankets removed during the 
superheated period in the other 
segment and immobilized Colling- 
wood with webbing. The bunks 
were not cold, but the feel of 
blankets would give a sense of 
security and Mrs. Mathewson cer- 
tainly needed that. 

She came to just as he was about 
to slide back her bunk. She began 
to struggle against the webbing and 



blanket with increasing violence. 
Instinctively he put out his hands 
to restrain her — then he remem- 
bered the position and severity of 
some of her bruises and reached 
for the hypo instead. 

“Take it easy, ma’am,” he said 
gently. “You’re safe now.” 

She stopped struggling and 
asked, “Mercer?” 

“Yes, ma’am.” 

He knew that he should sedate 
her quickly before she had a chance 
to think, to remember. But she 
could not go through the rest of her 
life under sedation and it was im- 
portant that she should try to face 
those ugly memories as soon as 
possible — not completely, of 
course, but in easy stages. He des- 
perately wanted to see her reac- 
tions, to get some idea of whether 
or not she would be able to handle 
it, before he used the hypo. Neilson 
hadn’t called him, so there was 
still a little time before he had to 
leave. 

“Bobby?” 

“He’s safe, too, but still in his 
pod. You must understand that 
having it to himself means he won’t 
run out of air as quickly as the 
others. We have to bring him in 
last, ma’am.” 

“I know. You could give him no 
preferential treatment. You acted 
as if he were a man.” 

“He did a man’s job, ma’am, and 
when he cried like a frightened little 
boy for his mother I pretended not 
to hear.” 

“And you brought him back. I’m 
grateful. I might not sound it — but 
I am. You treated him exactly 
right, said all the proper things— to 
all of us, not just to Bobby. You 



DARK INFERNO 



171 




were always cool, calm and — and 
nothing seemed to touch you or 
change you in any way. I suppose 
1 should be glad — we should all be 
glad — that you weren’t an overly- 
sympathetic character — ” 

AS SHE fell silent Mercer 
xV thought that clinically he was 
very pleased with her reactions, 
but that on the personal level he 
was coming off very badly. He 
wished that he could relax and stop 
radiating the composure he most 
decidedly did not feel. 

“I’m not supposed to display 
signs of weakness in front of the 
passengers,” Mercer said irritably, 
“and especially not before my 
patients, but if you knew me better 
you would realize that I could be 
quite bad tempered at times — and 
jealous and very, very angry in 
certain circumstances — ” 

“I’m sorry. Doctor,” she broke 
in. “I don’t know why I’m picking 
on you like this.” She put her hand 
out of the blanket and gripped his, 
the one that wasn’t holding the 
hypo. “Don’t put me out again just 
yet. I’m picking on you because 
I can’t get nasty with myself — at 
least, not out loud. When you were 
talking to us back there I could tell 
that you were sometimes angry and 
that you couldn’t afford to show 
it because everybody else was lis- 
tening and would have known what 
was going on in Three. But you 
knew and you made Kirk and 
Stone mad at you because you were 
like an amplified voice of con- 
science. You kept heading them 
off, talking sense, lecturing them. 
If it hadn’t been for you it would 



have happened much sooner. Are 
they both — both — ” 

Her grip was so tight that his 
fingers were turning white. He 
nodded. 

“Maybe I should not have been 
so hard to get,” she went on, but 
pleading with him with her eyes to 
argue and disagree with everything 
she was saying. “These days no- 
body would have worried, would 
they? And you would not have 
talked about it. But they were 
strangers, just like my husband was 
several different kinds of stranger 
before he died and all the different 
strangers wanted to make love to 
me. And it was so open out there, 
so clean and bright and empty that 
I couldn’t — it would have been like 
sinning in heaven.” She paused, 
looking away from him. “But I 
could have forced myself and once 
I almost did. If they had had me 
they might not have started fight- 
ing.” 

Mercer shook his head. “Then I 
would have had to lecture you — at 
very inconvenient times — about 
the need to avoid generating heat.” 

Still she would not look at him 
as she said, “After he knocked me 
out — what happened?” 

“Nothing much,” said Mercer. 
“He became angry and frustrated 
— very angry and extremely frus- 
trated from what I could hear — 
and I was listening very carefully, 
you understand. Then he collasped 
and died from heat-stroke a few 
minutes later, leaving just enough 
air to keep you alive until 1 arrived. 
But you should try to forget all 
about it, you know. It’s over. And 
you’ve a grip like a wrestler, 
ma’am. If I’m to perform any more

miracles of surgery you’d better 
not break my fingers.” 

“You aren’t telling the truth,” 
she said angrily, still without let- 
ting go. “You know it is important 
to me and you just want me to 
think — ” 

“It’s important to me, too,” 
Mercer broke in quietly. “Not 
vitally important, you understand, 
but still important enough to make 
me glad that I’m not lying.” 

“I’m not sure that I understand 
you,” she said, but her expression 
said that she did and her grip on 
his hand eased. She added: “Will I 
have to tell people about it? Will 
there be an investigation?” 

“Not unless you want one,” said 
Mercer. “As far as I’m concerned 
I don’t really know who did what 
to whom. Both men were unrec- 
ognizable when I got to them and 
once I knew that they were dead 
and you weren’t, I couldn’t waste 
time reconstructing the crime. If 
you like I can say, quite truthfully, 
that one died from asphyxiation 
and one from heat-stroke. That 
isn’t the whole truth, of course, but 
I’m thinking about Mrs. Kirk’s 
feelings as well as yours and 
Bobby’s -and even you don’t know 
for sure what happened at the end. 
Nobody has jurisdiction in space- 
wreck incidents like this, so there 
is no point in talking about it if 
you don’t want to. The only people 
who would be interested are the 
news media folks, and they — ” 

“No,” she said firmly. 

“I didn’t think you would want 
that,” he said, bringing up the 
hypo. “So just try to forget the 
whole thing for the time being and 
sleep. And let go of my hand. 



You’ll be in this bunk until your 
cracked ribs mend, so you can ex- 
pect to see a lot more of me — ” 

He stopped because she was 
laughing and wincing because 
laughing must have been hurting 
her ribs. 

“Is that possible?” she said. 

Mercer smiled in return. “I can’t 
answer that, ma’am, until you are 
completely recovered. There are 
rules about doctor-patient relation- 
ships, you know.” 

Before she could reply he had 
tucked her bare arm under the 
blanket and closed the bunk. 

She had made him aware for the 
first time in two weeks that he was 
improperly dressed, that he was 
not even wearing a cap like Neilson 
and that they were no longer in an 
emergency situation in which such 
lapses could be excused. He still 
had a few minutes to spare before 
the engineer needed him, so he 
shaved, climbed into a set of clean 
uniform coveralls and used the can- 
opy plastic to check that his cap 
was straight. The sooner everything 
returned to normal the better, he 
thought as he turned to go. 

<< l^r EILSON. I will need you 
in ten minutes, Mercer — 
this took a little longer than ex- 
pected. Prescott is back on board 
and wants to see you in the control- 
room.” 

“Mercer. Ten minutes.” 

The first officer was in Neilfon’s 
position, going over the engineering 
telltales. He looked at Mercer 
slowly from head to toes and shook 
his head. 

He said, “Before you leave to 
pick up the rest of the survivors I 



DARK INFERNO

want you to remember that there 
will be an inquiry when we get back 
to Earth into the Eurydice disaster 
and the proper functioning or 
otherwise of its survival equipment. 
Neilson, MacArdle and myself 
will be responsible for the technical 
evidence and you will deal with 
questions regarding the effects on 
passengers. You will also have to 
give medical evidence regarding 
the deaths of Kirk and Stone.” 
“Heat-stroke, asphyxiation and 
heart failure,” said Mercer. 

Prescott nodded. “Mrs. Mathew- 
son’s story might not agree with 
yours and, while I realize that she 
will not be returning to Earth, it 
could be awkward if — ” 

“She wants to forget about it 
and so do I,” said Mercer firmly. 
“That was my professional advice 
as well. There is also the fact that 
the media, if they got their hands 
on it, would be sure to imply all 
sorts of things which did not in fact 
happen. You see, both men were 
in such a mess that I don’t know, 
from my very brief observation of 
their bodies, who killed whom. 
It is possible, although not likely, 
that Stone made a comeback after 
Mrs. Mathewson was knocked out 
— so even she can’t be sure. Then 
there are the possible effects on the 
boy of reading that sort of stuff 
about his mother — or finding out 
about it in later life. She won’t talk 
about it, you can be sure of that.” 
Prescott looked relieved, but not 
completely. He said, “That’s good. 
I told Mrs. Kirk about her husband 
on the way in — I said that his death 
was due to excess weight making 
him vulnerable to the heat and low 
oxygen content of the air. She could 



suffer, too, if it got out that he died 
fighting over a woman. But I’m 
more concerned about you, Mercer, 
and what you may say when we get 
back. We are all going to be heroes, 
you especially. You could earn a lot 
of money from the media simply by 
telling the truth as you know it. 
And I couldn’t really blame you — 
especially since you only wanted 
space experience to land a good 
research job on Station Three — ” 

“If you don’t mind,” said Mer- 
cer, “I would like a little more 
space experience — of a less dra- 
matic nature, of course. And in any 
case I am more interested in a job 
on Ganymede Base now. I don’t 
want to embarrass the Mathewsons 
— or Mrs. Kirk — so if I can stay 
with the ship and toe the company 
line during the inquiry — ” 

“I’ll be captain,” said Prescott. 

“You almost dissuade me.” 

“I wasn’t trying to do so,” said 
Prescott quietly. “Just trying to 
give you fair warning that I am 
a consistently nasty person who is 
unlikely to change anything but his 
uniform.” 

“Neilson. We’ll be ready to go in 
three minutes, Mercer.” 

As he turned to go Mercer won- 
dered if he would change very 
much. He was thinking of a boy 
who had played spaceman for two 
long and dangerous weeks and of 
his mother who would soon have 
him with her again. He had helped 
to save the lives of both and he was 
beginning to feel responsible for 
them in an oddly possessive way 
and the voyage was less than three 
weeks gone. It was a silly question 
because he had already changed in 
many ways. ★

(Continued from page 66} 
But you have no recourse when you 
meet a disinterested man, and 
that’s me.” He sighed. “Trouble is 
that you’ve paid us too well. There 
could be an awful hoo-rah about 
it, people swarming in.” He pushed 
the hee-haw button and the pam- 
mas never moved. 

“I think I’ve got it.” He had 
never been an indecisive man, 
though always irresolute in his own 
peculiar way. He wrapped the FLR 
carefully and put it into his pocket. 
“Well, somebody’s got to be re- 
sponsible,” he said. “It always, 
invariably and forever comes down 
to one man. The best gift I can give 
you is to leave you alone.” 

The pammas sat like old avo- 
cados and said nothing. 

T hat evening he spoke to the 
assembled class. He sent 
people off to a dozen cities. When 
they returned next day, each with a 
cargo module, all the burros and 
trailers and campers were loaded. 
Rohnagan kicked aside his path 
to the spring. 

The foundation lifted from Edris 
with all the modules in lock and 
everyone crowded into the founda- 
tion. No planetary communication 
band was open. At the bare mini- 
mum altitude they kicked to Inter- 



face alignment and punched an 
autotape for Brummigen. They 
landed at a bonded port and 
dispersed. 

Two weeks later the class in 
Advanced Field Exploration met 
for the last time in the security field 
house on Geology plateau. It was a 
dome building the School of Archi- 
tecture used as a horrid example in 
their sneer tours of College Sta- 
tion. Rohnagan stood in front of 
the class and tapped his pointer on 
the floor. The hubbub faded. He 
left the projection on the screen. 

“There will be no written finan- 
cial report except on an individual 
basis for a particular purpose,” he 
announced. “As you can see from 
the summary of sales, yours has 
been an extraordinarily profitable 
class. None of you assigned in- 
come, but if you had, the twenty- 
five percent of one pro rata share 
would pay for the education of a 
moderately intelligent man. I don’t 
know if this has been the most re- 
munerative class on College Sta- 
tion. What I do know is, all of you 
are modestly in the chips.” 

While the class cheered, he took 
the financial summary from the 
projector and dropped it into the 
disposal slot. 

“For those who may have for- 
gotten the principles of pragmatic 
mineralogy, the reason you have 
received personal vouchers instead

of direct deposits is a truism of 
mining and in the nature of the 
occupation. To wit — it’s sometimes 
wise to have an unknown, unattach- 
able account.” 

Laughter. 

“I have assigned half the storm 
jewels and blush pearls to various 
colleges and museums on College 
Station. The other half is still in 
appraisal. A further dividend will 
be sent to your addresses of record 
in the next six months. If anyone 
would like to sell his interest now it 
will have to clear through me. My 
minimum bid for one full share is 
ninety thousand.” 

Cheers. 

“The certified individual finan- 
cial report I mentioned will be 
necessary if you want to return to 
Edris. I don’t recommend it. The 
Bahia cities are extremely hostile 
to every individual here on an in- 
dividual basis. The export duty and 
penalties would have to be paid. I 
ordered locally illegal take-off 
because of the difficulty of apprai- 
sal and the inevitable delay in pay- 
ment. Many years ago I found 
oweins and ended up with roughly 
fifteen percent of their finished 
value after eight years. Questions?” 
“That’s why the conditioning?” 
“It was inadvisable to go as a 
class, yes.” 

“We were conditioned not to 
squirrel stuff ourselves,” said Gur- 



chie Gronewald. “Without pre- 
judice now, Tom, did you bring 
back anything? We know about the 
storm jewels — fantastic! But did 
you or Nan or other staff hide 
stuff? I’m not complaining, dam- 
mit, I’m curious is all — ” 

“I brought back an FLR as a 
personal souvenir,” said Rohnagan. 
“Here it is. Anybody want to bid 
on it? We’ll split the proceeds.” He 
grinned as Alf Swinney and two 
others sat on Gronewald. “Other 
questions?” 

“Will you go back to Edris?” 
“No. ‘All them little eyes?’ ” 
“Can we enroll again in two- 
twenty?” 

“Certainly. Keep in mind, this 
has been exceptional.” 

“What planet next class, Tom?” 
“I don’t know. I’m going to 
school myself. Won’t be teaching.” 
“What are you going to take?” 
“Pragmatic ethics.” 

“What for?” 

“I want to be good.” He grinned. 
“Class dismissed.” 

The FLR in his pocket turned 
cold. It was a temperature variable 
stone. Maybe it responded to the 
phases of the moon. Maybe it was 
a compass to good. And by whose 
standards? How congruent, how 
universal was good? 

“Good question,” he told him- 
self, and accepted an invitation to 
the class party. ★

We’re close to 
acurefpr 

leukemia. 




A year ago, we wouldn't 
have dared say that. Not 
with that beautiful word 

W // • •• The 

cure in it. 

"Temporary remission", yes. New forms 
of leukemia treatment were helping some 
children stay alive a little longer. But that 
seemed to be all that medical science could 
give them. Another few months. Another 
birthday or two. 

Now we're seeing something that's almost 
too good to believe. A whole crop of kids who 
are alive and well 5 years or more after get- 
ting a new kind of drug therapy. And after 
5 years, cancer researchers begin to hesitat- 
ingly, hopefully, talk of a permanent "cure." 

Leukemia is cancer of the blood. Before 
you have a cure, you have to destroy every 
last cancer cell in the bloodstream. The new 
treatment is a combination of different anti- 



leukemia drugs, so that, 
hopefully, any cells missed 
by one drug might be killed 
by another. 

It seems to work. We're still holding our 
breath, but it really seems to work. The 5-year 
survivors that gladden our hearts today are 
the result of combination treatments begun in 
1964. And work has been going on fever- 
ishly ever since. Each year, the children who 
get leukemia have a far better chance of cure 
than those of the year before. 

The American Cancer Society plays a vital 
part in this exciting work. So, when our volun- 
teer comes to your door this month, be gen- 
erous. Especially if you have children. Or 
grandchildren. 



American Cancer Society^ 

We want to wipe out cancer in your lifetime.** 




What is it? 



A black dot, circle, sphere, neutron, eye pupil, tunnel opening, planet, hole, cosmos ? 



Depending on your perspective, knowledge, 
imagination, the answer can be simple or 
complex, commonplace or extraordinary, def- 
inite or infinite. 

We’d like to introduce you to some unique- 
ly gifted authors who have created an excit- 
ing, mind-stretching literature. Writers who 
can look at a dot or a pebble and see a uni- 
verse of sub-atomic particles. Who can 
speculate on the incredible number of inter- 
dependent cells that make up a human body 



and envision .whole planetary life forms inter 
connected the same way. 

Who forecast things like nuclear powei, 
supersonic jets, computers, space probes, and 
moon walks long before they happened. Sci 
ence Fiction authors are writing tomorrrrw's 
history today. 

Just 10(i will bring you any three books de
