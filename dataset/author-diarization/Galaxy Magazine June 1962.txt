THERE are some things that cannot 
be generally told - things you ought to 
know. Great truths are dangerous to 
some — but factors for personal power 
an^y accomplishment in the hands of 
those who understand them. Behind 
the tales of the miracles and mysteries 
of the ancients, lie centuries of their 
secret probing into nature’s laws — 
their amazing discoveries of the hid- 
den processes of man’s mind, and the 
mastery of life’s problems. Once shroud- 
ed in mystery to avoid their destruc- 
tion by mass feat and ignorance, these 
facts remain a useful heritage for the 
thousands of men and women who pri- 
vately use them in their homes today.

THE DEADLY MISSION 
OF PHINEAS SNODGRASS 



^^HIS is the story of Phineas 
Snodgrass, inventor. He built 
a time machine. 

He built a time machine and in 
it he went back some two thou- 
sand years, to about the time of 
the birth of Christ. He made him- 
self known to the Emperor Augus- 
tus, his Lady Livia and other rich 
and powerful Romans of the day 
and, quickly making friends, se- 
cured their cooperation in bring- 
ing about a rapid transformation 



of Year One living habits. (He 
stole the idea from a science- 
fiction novel by L. Sprague de 
Camp, called Lest Darkness Fall . ) 

His time machine wasn’t very 
big, but his heart was, so Snod- 
grass selected his cargo with the 
plan of providing the maximum 
immediate help for the world’s 
people. The principal features of 
ancient Rome were dirt and dis- 
ease, pain and death. Snodgrass 
decided to make the Roman 



5 



world healthy and to keep its 
people alive through 20th century 
medicine. Everything else could 
take care of itself, once the human 
race was free of its terrible 
plagues and early deaths. 

Snodgrass introduced penicillin 
and aureomycin and painless den- 
tistry. He ground lenses for spec- 
tacles and explained the surgical 
techniques for removing cataracts. 
He taught anesthesia and the 
germ theory of disease, and 
showed how to purify drinking 
water. He built Kleenex factories 
and taught the Romans to cover 
their mouths when they coughed. 
He demanded, and got, covers for 
the open Roman sewers, and he 
pioneered the practice of the bal- 
anced diet. 

Snodgrass brought health to 
the ancient world, and kept his 
own health, too. He lived to more 
than a hundred years. He died, in 
fact, in the year 100 A.D., a very 
contented man. 

When Snodgrass arrived in 
Augustus’s great palace on the 
Palatine Hill, there were some 
250,000,000 human beings alive 
in the world. He persuaded the 
principate to share his blessings 
with all the world, benefiting not 
only the hundred million subjects 
of the Empire, but the other hun- 
dred millions in Asia and the tens 
of millions in Africa, the Western 
Hemisphere and all the Pacific 
islands. 



Everybody got healthy. 

Infant mortality dropped at 
once, from ninety deaths in a 
hundred to fewer than two. Life 
expectancies doubled immediate- 
ly. Everyone was well, and dem- 
onstrated their health by having 
more children, who grew in health 
to maturity and had more. 

It is a feeble population that 
cannot double itself every gener- 
ation if it tries. 

These Romans, Goths and 
Mongols were tough. Every 
thirty years the population of the 
world increased by a factor of 
two. In the year 30 A.D. the world 
population was a half billion. In 
60 A.D. it was a full billion. By 
the time Snodgrass passed away, 
a happy man, it was as large as it 
is today. 

TT IS too bad that Snodgrass did 
-*■ not have room in his time ma- 
chine for the blueprints of cargo 
ships, the texts on metallurgy to 
build the tools that would make 
the reapers that would harvest 
the fields — for the triple-expan- 
sion steam turbines that would 
generate the electricity that 
would power the machines that 
would run the cities — for all the 
technology that two thousand 
subsequent years had brought 
about. 

But he didn’t. 

Consequently by the time of 
his death conditions were no long- 



6 



GALAXY 



er quite perfect. A good many 
people were hungry. A great 
many were badly housed. 

On the whole, Snodgrass was 
pleased, for all these things could 
surely take care of themselves. 
With a healthy world population, 
the increase of numbers would be 
a mere spur to research. Bound- 
less nature, once its ways were 
studied, would surely provide for 
any number of human beings. 

Indeed it did. Steam engines 
on the Newcomen design were 
lifting water to irrigate fields to 
grow food long before his death. 
The Nile was dammed at Aswan 
in the year 55. Battery-powered 
street cars replaced oxcarts in 
Rome and Alexandria before 75 
A.D., and the galley slaves were 
freed by huge, clumsy Diesel out- 
boards that drove the food ships 
across the Mediterreanean a few 
years later. 

In the year 200 A.D. the world 
had now something over twenty 
billion souls, and technology was 
running neck-and-neck with ex- 
pansion. Nuclear-driven plows 
had cleared the Teutoburg Wald, 
where Varus’s bones were still 
moldering, and fertilizer made 
from ion-exchange mining of the 
sea produced fantastic crops of 
hybrid grains. In 300 A.D. the 
world population stood at a 
quarter of a trillion. Hydrogen 
fusion produced fabulous quanti- 
ties of energy from the sea; atomic 



transmutation converted any 
matter into food. This was neces- 
sary, because there was no longer 
any room for farms. The Earth 
was getting crowded. By the mid- 
dle of the 6th century the 60,000,- 
000 square miles of land surface 
on the Earth was so well covered 
that no human being standing 
anywhere on dry land could 
stretch out his arms in any di- 
rection without touching another 
human being standing beside 
him. 

But everyone was healthy, and 
science marched on. The seas 
were drained, which immediately 
tripled the available land area. 
(In fifty years the sea bottoms 
were also full.) Energy which had 
come from the fusion of marine 
hydrogen now came by the tap- 
ping of the full energy output of 
the Sun, through gigantic “mir- 
rors” composed of pure force. The 
other planets froze, of course; but 
this no longer mattered, since in 
the decades that followed they 
were disintegrated for the sake of 
the energy at their cores. So was 
the Sun. Maintaining life on 
Earth on such artificial standards 
was prodigal of energy consump- 
tion; in time every star in the 
Galaxy was transmitting its total 
power output to the Earth, and 
plans were afoot to tap Andro- 
meda, which would care for all 
necessary expansion for — thirty 
years. 



7 



At this point a calculation was 
made. 

Taking the weight of the aver- 
age man at about a hundred and 
thirty pounds - — in round num- 
bers, 6 X 10^ grams — and allow- 
ing for a continued doubling of 
population every thirty years (al- 
though there was no such thing 
as a “year” any more, since the 
Sun had been disintegrated; now 
a lonely Earth floated aimlessly 
toward Vega), it was discovered 
that by the year 1962 the total 
mass of human flesh, bone and 
blood would be 6 X grams. 

This presented a problem. The 
total mass of the Earth itself was 
only 5.98 x 10"^ grams. Already 
humanity lived in burrows p>ene- 
trating crust and basalt and quar- 
rying into the congealed nickel- 
iron core; by 1962 all the core 
itself would have been trans- 
muted into living men and 
women, and their galleries would 
have to be tunneled through 
masses of their own bodies, a 
writhing, squeezed ball of living 
corpses drifting through space. 

Moreover simple arithmetic 
showed that this was not the end. 
In finite time the mass of human 
beings would equal the total mass 



of the Galaxy; and in some fur- 
ther time it would equal and ex- 
ceed the total mass of all galaxies 
everywhere. 

This state of affairs could no 
longer be tolerated, and so a 
project was launched. 

With some difficulty resources 
were diverted to permit the con- 
struction of a small but important 
device. It was a time machine. 
With one volunteer aboard (se- 
lected from the 900 trillion who 
applied) it went back to the year 
1. Its cargo was only a hunting 
rifle with one cartridge, and with 
that cartridge the volunteer as- 
sassinated Snodgrass as he 
trudged up the Palatine. 

To the great (if only potential) 
joy of some quintillions of never- 
to-be-born persons. Darkness 
blessedly fell. 

Vj^ELL, it isn’t exactly a true 
story. 

Not from this end, anyway. But 
. a population doubling every 
thirty years is close to the average 
of “new” nations; even the United 
States does it in fifty ... so come 
back two thousand years from 
now and let’s see!

M ALACHI Runner didn’t 
like to look at General 
Compton. Compton the 
lean, keen, slash-gesturing semi- 
demagogue of a few years ago 
had been much easier to live with 
than Compton as he was now, and 
Runner had never had much 
stomach for him even then. So 
Runner kept his eyes firmly fixed 
on the device he was showing. 

Keeping his eyes where they 
were was not as easy as it might 
have been. The speckled, bulbous

distortion in front of him was 
what Headquarters, several hun- 
dred miles away under The Great 
Salt Lake, was pleased to refer to 
as an Invisible Weapons Carrier. 
It was hard to see — because it 
was designed to be hard to see. 

But Malachi Runner was going 
to have to take this thing up 
across several hundred miles of 
terrain, and he was standing too 
close to it not to see it. The In- 
visible Weapons Carrier was, in 
fact, a half-tone of reality. It was

large enough inside to contain a 
man and a fusion bomb, together 
with the power supply for its en- 
gine and its light amplifiers. It 
bristled with a stiff mat of flexi- 
ble-plastic light-conducting rods, 
whose stub ends, clustered togeth- 
er in a tight mosaic pointing out- 
ward in every conceivable 
direction, contrived to bend 
light around its bulk. It was pres- 
ently conducting, toward Runner, 
a picture of the carved rock di- 
rectly behind it. 

The rock, here in this chamber 
cut under the eastern face of the 
Medicine Bow Mountains, was 
reasonably featureless; and the 
light-amplifiers carefully con- 
trolled the intensity of the 
picture. So the illusion was 
marred by only two things: the 
improbable angle of the pictured 
floor it was also showing him, and 
the fact that for every rod con- 
ducting light from the wall, an- 
other rod was conducting light 
from Runner’s direction, so that 
to his eyes the ends of half the 
rods were dead black. 

“Invisibility,” Compton said 
scornfully from behind and to 
one side of Runner. Or, rather, he 
whispered and an amplifier took 
up the strain in raising his voice 
to a normal level. “But it’s not 
bad camouflage. You might make 
it. Colonel.” 

“I have orders to try.” Runner 
would not give Compton the satis- 



faction of knowing that his im- 
patience was with the means pro- 
vided, not with the opportunity. 
The war could not possibly be 
permitted to continue the thirty 
years more given to it by Comp- 
ton’s schedule. Compton himself 
was proof of that. 

Not that proof required Comp- 
ton. He was only one. There were 
many. 

TIUNNER glanced aside at the 
cadet officer who had guided 
him from the tramway stop to 
this chamber here, in one of the 
side passages of the siege bore 
that was being driven under the 
Medicine Bows in the direction 
of the alien spaceship that had 
dominated the world for fifty 
years. The boy — none of these 
underofficers were older than 
seventeen — had a face that 
looked as if it had been made 
from wet paper and then baked 
dry. His eyesockets were black 
pits from which his red eyes 
stared, and his hands were like 
chicken’s feet. His bloated stom- 
ach pushed against the wide 
white plastic of his sidearm belt. 

He looked, in short, like most 
of the other people Runner had 
seen here since getting off the 
tram. As he was only seventeen, 
he had probably been born un- 
derground, somewhere along the 
advancing bore, and had never 
so much as seen sunlight, much 



10 



GALAXY 



less eaten anything grown under 
it. He had been bred and educa- 
ted — or mis-educated; show him 
something not printed in Military 
Alphabet and you showed him 
the Mayan Codex — trained 
and assigned to duty in a 
tunnel in the rock; and never in 
his life had he been away from 
the sound of the biting drills. 

“You’re not eager to go, Colo- 
nel?” Compton’s amplified whis- 
per said. “You’re Special Division, 
so of course this isn’t quite your 
line of work. I know your ideals, 
you Special Division men. Find 
some way to keep the race from 
dehumanizing itself.” And now 
he chose to make a laugh, re- 
membering to whisper it. “One 
way to do that would be to end 
the war before another generation 
goes by.” 

Runner wondered, not for the 
first time, if Compton would find 
some way to stop him without 
actually disobeying the Head- 
quarters directive ordering him 
to cooperate. Runner wondered, 
too, what Compton would say if 
he knew just how eager he was 
for the mission — and why. Run- 
ner could answer the questions for 
himself by getting to know Comp- 
ton better, of course. There was 
the rub. 

Runner did not think he could 
ever have felt particularly civ- 
ilized toward anyone who had 
married his fiancee. That was un- 



derstandable. It was even wel- 
come. Runner perversely 
cherished his failings. Not too 
perversely, at that — Runner 
consciously cherished every hu- 
man thing remaining to the race. 

Runner could understand why 
a woman would choose to marry 
the famous Corps of Engineers 
general who had already chivvied 
and bullied the Army — the or- 
ganizing force of the world — into 
devoting its major resources to 
this project he had fostered. 
There was no difficulty in seeing 
why Norma Brand might turn 
away from Malachi Runner in 
favor of a man who was not only 
the picture of efficiency and suc- 
cessful intellect but was thought 
likely to be the savior of Hu- 
manity. 

But Compton several years 
later was — 

Runner turned and looked; he 
couldn’t spend the rest of the day 
avoiding it. Compton, several 
years later, was precisely what a 
man of his time could become if 
he was engaged in pushing a 
three hundred mile tunnel 
through the rock of a mountain 
chain, never knowing how much 
his enemy might know about it, 
and if he proposed to continue 
that excavation to its end, thirty 
years from now, whether the flesh 
was willing to meet his schedules 
or not. 

Compton’s leonine head pro- 



FOR LOVE 



n 



truded from what was very like 
a steam cabinet on wheels. In 
that cabinet were devices to assist 
his silicotic lungs, his sclerotic 
blood vessels, and a nervous sys- 
tem so badly deranged that even 
several years ago Runner had de- 
tected the great man in fits of 
spastic trembling. And God knew 
what else might be going wrong 
with Compton’s body that Comp- 
ton’s will would not admit. 

/~^OMPTON grinned at him. Al- 
^ most simultaneously, a bell 
chimed softly in the control panel 
on the back of the cabinet. The 
cadet aide sprang forward, read 
the warning in some dial or other 
and made an adjustment in the 
settings of the control knobs. 
Compton craned his neck in its 
collar of loose gray plastic sheet- 
ing and extended his grin to the 
boy. “Thank you. Cadet. I thought 
I was starting to feel a little 
dizzy.” 

“Yes, sir.” The aide went back 
to his rest position. 

“All right. Colonel,” Compton 
said to Runner as though nothing 
had happened. “I’ve been curious 
to see this gimmick of yours in 
operation ever since it was de- 
livered here. Thank you. You can 
turn it off now. And after that. 
I’ll show you something you’ve 
never seen.” 

Runner frowned for a moment. 
Then he nodded to himself. He 



crawled under the weapons car- 
rier. From that close it was no 
longer “invisible,” only vaguely 
dizzying to the eye. He opened 
the hatch and turned off the main 
switch. 

Compton could only have 
meant he was going to show him 
the ship. 

Of course, he had seen films of 
it often enough. Who had not? 
The Army had managed to keep 
spy-drones flying above the Mis- 
sissippi plain. The ship ignored 
them unless they took on aggres- 
sive trajectories. 

Presumably there was some 
limit to the power the ship felt 
able to expend. Or perhaps the 
ship simply did not care what 
Earthmen might learn from 
watching it; perhaps it underesti- 
mated them. 

This latest in the long chain of 
Compton’s command bunkers, 
creeping mole-like toward the 
ship, was lighted a sickly orange- 
yellow. Runner seemed to recall 
a minor scandal in the Quarter- 
master Corps. Something about a 
contractor who had bribed or 
cozened a Corps officer into be- 
lieving that yellow light duplica- 
ted natural sunlight. Contractor 
and misled officer were no doubt 
long dead in one of the labor 
battalions at the bore face, but 
some use for the useless lights had 
had to be found. And so here they 
were, casting their pall, just as 



12 



GALAXY 



if two lives and two careers had 
not already gone toward settling 
the account. 

But, of course, nothing settles 
an account as derelict as Earth’s 
was. 

In that light, Compton’s cabi- 
net rolled forward to the bank of 
hooded television screens jury- 
rigged against a somewhat water- 
proofed wall. A row of technicians 
perched on stools watched what 
the drones were showing them. 

“Lights,” Compton said, and 
the aide made the room dark. 
“Here, Colonel — try this one.” 
He pointed his chin toward a 
particular screen, and Runner 
stepped closer. For the first time 
in his life, he saw something only 
a few hundred people of his time 
had seen in an undelayed picture; 
he saw the ship. It was two hun- 
dred miles away from his present 
location, and two hundred fifty 
miles high. 



II 

riFTY years ago, the alien ship 
landed butt-down in the 
northwest quadrant of the central 
plain of the United States. Stern- 
first, she had put one of her four 
landing jacks straight down to 
bedrock through the town of 
Scott’s Bluff, Nebraska, and the 
diagonally opposite leg seventy- 
five miles away near Julesburg, 



Colorado. Her shadow swept fifty 
thousand square miles. 

A tower of pitted dull green 
and brown-gold metal, her fore- 
peak narrowing in perspective 
into a needle raking unseen 
through the thinnest last margins 
of the atmosphere, she had nei- 
ther parleyed nor even communi- 
cated with anything on or of 
Earth. No one had ever seen any- 
thing of what her crew might look 
like. To this day, she still neither 
spoke to Earth nor listened to 
whatever Terrestrials might want 
to say to her. She was neither an 
embassy nor an invader. 

For fifty years she had been 
broadcasting the same code group 
into space, hour after hour, but 
she had neither made nor re- 
ceived any beam transmissions 
along any portion of the electro- 
magnetic spectrum. The presump- 
tion was she had a distress beacon 
out on general principles, but had 
no hope of communicating with a 
particular source of rescue. 

She had come down a little 
erratically; there was some sug- 
gestion of jury-rigging in the 
plates over an apparently buckled 
section of the hull shrouding her 
stern tubes; there seemed to be 
some abnormal erosion at one 
segment of the lip around the 
main jet. Over the years. Head- 
quarters Intelligence had reached 
the decision that she was down 
on Earth for a self-refit.

Landing, she had immediately 
put out surface parties and air 
patrols — there were turret- 
mounted weapons all along her 
flanks; she was clearly a warship 
of some kind — in a display of 
resources that badly upset the 
Terrestrial military forces observ- 
ing her. The surface parties were 
squat-profiled, tracked, armored 
amphibious machines with six- 
teen-foot bogeys and a track-to- 
turtledeck height of seventy-five 
feet. They had fanned out over 
the surrounding states and, with- 
out regard to road, river, fence or 
farmhouse, had foraged for min- 
erals. It had finally been conclud- 
ed that the vehicles, equipped 
with power shovels, claws, drills, 
ore buckets and whatever other 
mining tools were necessary, were 
remote-controlled from the ship 
on the basis of local topography 
but not with any reference to the 
works of Man. Or to the presence 
of Man. The undeviating tracks 
made as much of a hayrick as 
they did of a company of anti- 
tank infantry or a battalion of 
what the Army in those days was 
pleased to call “armor.” 

Whatever had hurt her, there 
was no point in Earthmen specu- 
lating on it. No missile could 
reach her. She had antimissile 
missiles and barrage patterns that, 
in operation, had made the Mis- 
sissippi plain uninhabitable. An 
attempt was made to strike her 



foraging parties, with some im- 
mediate success. She then ex- 
tended her air cover to the entire 
civilized world, and began me- 
thodically smashing down every 
military installation and every 
industrial complex capable of 
supporting one. 

It was a tribute to the energy 
and perseverance of Twentieth 
Century Man. And it was the 
cause of Twenty-First Century 
man’s finding himself broken into 
isolated enclaves, almost all of 
them either underground or so 
geographically remote as to be 
valueless, and each also nearly 
incapable of physical communica- 
tion with any other. 

It did not take a great deal of 
Terrestrial surface activity to at- 
tract one of the ship’s nearly 
invulnerable aircraft. Runner’s 
journey between Salt Lake and 
the tunnel pit head had been 
long, complicated by the need to 
establish no beaten path, and 
anxious. Only the broken terrain, 
full of hiding places, had made 
it possible at all. 

But the balance between birth 
and death rates was once more 
favorable, and things were no 
longer going all the ship’s way — 
whether the ship knew it or not. 
Still, it would be another thirty 
years before this siege bore 
Compton was driving could reach, 
undermine and finally topple the 
ship.

GALAXY 



I ■'HIRTY years from now, Run- 
ner and the other members 
of Special Division knew, the bi- 
ped, spindling, red-eyed creatures 
emerging from the ground to loot 
that broken ship and repay them- 
selves for this nightmare cam- 
paign would be only externally 
human — some of them. Some 
would be far less. Special Divi- 
sion’s hope — its prospects were 
not good enough to call it a task 
— was to attempt to shorten that 
time while Humanity was still 
human. 

And if the human race did not 
topple the ship, or if the ship 
completed its refit and left before 
they could reach it, then all this 
fifty years of incalculable material 
and psychic expenditure was ir- 
retrievably lost. Humanity would 
be bankrupt. They were all living 
now on the physical and emotion- 
al credit embodied in that tower 
of alien resources. From it, they 
could strip a technology to make 
the world new again — nothing 
less could accomplish that; in its 
conquest, there was a triumph to 
renew the most exhausted heart. 
Or almost any such heart. Runner 
could only speculate on how 
many of the victors would, like 
Compton, be unable to dance 
upon the broken corpse. 

If anyone on Earth doubted, no 
one dared to dwell aloud on the 
enfeebling thought. 

They had to have the ship. 



“She’s got some kind of force- 
field running over her structure,” 
Compton remarked, looking at 
the image on the screen. “We 
know that much. Something that 
keeps the crystals in her metal 
from deforming and sliding. She’d 
collapse. If we had something like 
that field, we could build to her 
size, too.” 

“Is there that much metal in 
the world?” 

Compton looked sideward at 
Runner. “A damned sight more. 
But if we had her, we wouldn’t 
need it.” 

Yes, Runner thought, keeping 
himself from looking at the 
screen now as faithfully as he 
had prevented himself from look- 
ing at Compton earlier. Yes, if 
we had the ship we wouldn’t need 
this, and we wouldn’t need that, 
or the other thing. We could even 
engineer such wonderful cabinets 
like the one in which Compton 
dwelt that none of us would have 
to fear a stop to our ambitions, 
and we could roll along on the 
wonderfully smooth corridor 
floors we could carve away from 
the places where storms and light- 
ning strike. 

For how could you live, Comp- 
ton, out there where I have to go 
tomorrow? 

Compton, looking up at him, 
shrewdly said: “Do you know I 
approve of the Special Division? 
I think you people serve a very

necessary function. I need the 
pressure of rivals.” 

Runner thought; You are ugly. 

i4T HAVE to go to sleep,” he 
had said and left Compton to 
his screens and schedules. But he 
did not take the lift down to the 
Bachelor Officers’ Quarters where 
he had been given an accommo- 
dation — a two-man cubicle for 
himself alone; the aide, never 
having experienced solitude, as 
Runner had, had been envious. 
Instead, he puzzled his way 
through another of the branching 
temporary passageways that were 
crudely chopped out for living 
space near the advancing bore. 

He searched until he found the 
proper door. The letter Norma 
had sent him did not contain the 
most exact directions. It had 
spoken in local terms: “Follow the 
first parallel until you reach the 
fourth gallery,” and so forth. 

He knocked, and the gas-tight 
door opened. 

“I heard you would be here to- 
day,” Norma said in a choked 
voice, and there was much for 
him to read in the waxiness of 
her skin and the deep wrinkles 
that ran from the corners of her 
nose to the corners of her blood- 
less mouth. 

He took the hands she offered, 
and stepped inside. 

There was one large room; that 
is, a room large enough for a free- 



standing single cot, rather than a 
bunk, and a cleared area, faintly 
marked by black rubber wheel- 
marks, large enough for a cabinet 
to turn around in. A Compton- 
sized cabinet. 

“How are you, Norma?” he said 
as if he could not guess, and she 
did not trouble to answer him. 
She shut the door and leaned 
against it as if they had both just 
fled in here. 

“Are you going out in the morn- 
ing?” 

Runner nodded. It seemed to 
him he had time at least to say 
a few conventional things to the 
girl who had been his fiancee, and 
then Compton’s wife. But she ap- 
parently thought otherwise. 

“Are you going to make it?” 

“I don’t know. It’s a gamble.” 

“Do you think you’ll make it?” 

“No.” 

It had never seemed reasonable 
that he would. In the Technical 
Section of the Special Division 
there were men — fully his equals 
— who were convinced he could 
succeed. They said they had cal- 
culated the ship’s weaknesses, and 
he believed they had figures and 
evaluations, right enough. He in 
his own turn believed there were 
things a man had to be willing to 
do whether they seemed reason- 
able or not, simply because they 
seemed necessary. So neither fact 
nor opinion could modify his tak- 
ing the weapons carrier out

against the ship tomorrow. “But 
I hope I’ll make it,” he said. 

hope you’ll make it,” 
Norma said tonelessly. She 
reached out quickly and took his 
hands again. “What a forlorn 
thing to tell me! You know I 
won’t be able to stand it down 
here much longer. How do we 
know the ship doesn’t have seis- 
mic detectors? How do we know 
it isn’t just letting us concentrate 
ourselves here so it can smash us 
before we become dangerous?” 
“Well, we don’t know, but it 
seems unlikely. They have geo- 
logical probes, of course. The 
gamble is that they’re only probes 
and not detectors.” 

“If they don’t smash us, there’s 
only one reason — they know 
they’ll be finished and gone before 
we can reach them!” 

This was all wrong; he could 
not talk to her about anything 
important before he had calmed 
her. He said, searching for some 
way to reach her: “But we have 
to go on as if they won’t. Nothing 
else we’ve tried has worked. At 
least Compton’s project hasn’t 
failed.” 

“Now you’re on his side! You!” 
She was nothing like the way 
she had been with him. She would 
never have been like this. The 
way she was now, she and Mala- 
chi Runner could not meet. He 
understood, now, that in the years 



since she had left Headquarters 
with Compton she had come to 
think back on Malachi Runner 
not as a man but as an embodi- 
ment of that safe life. It was not 
him she was shouting out to. It 
was to all those days gone forever. 

And so I must be those days of 
life in a place where shafts lead 
to the wine-rich air of the surface, 
and there is no sound of metal 
twisting in the rock. I am not 
Malachi Runner now. I hoped I 
could be. I should have read that 
letter as it was, not as I hoped it 
was. Good-by, Runner, you aren’t 
needed here. 

“No, I’m not on his side. But I 
wouldn’t dare stop him if I could. 
I wouldn’t dare shut off any hope 
that things will end and the world 
can go back to living.” 

“End? Where can they end? He 
goes on; he can’t move an arm or 
a finger, but he goes on. He 
doesn’t need anything but that 
box that keeps him alive and this 
tunnel and that ship. Where can 
I touch him?” 

'' I ■'HEY stood separated by their 
outstretched hands, and Run- 
ner watched her as intently as 
though he had been ordered to 
make a report on her. 

“I thought I could help him, 
but now he’s in that box!” 

Yes, Runner thought, now he’s 
in that box. He will not let death 
rob him of seeing the end of his 



FOR LOVE 



17 



plans. And you love him, but he’s 
gone where you can’t follow. Can 
you? 

He considered what he saw in 
her now, and he knew she was 
lost. But he thought that if the 
war would only end, there would 
be ways to reach her. He could 
not reach her now; nothing could 
reach her. He knew insanity was 
incurable, but he thought that 
perhaps she was not yet insane; 
if he could at least keep her with- 
in this world’s bounds, there 
might be time, and ways, to bring 
her back. If not to him, then at 
least to the remembered days of 
Headquarters. 

“Norma!” he said, driven by 
what he foresaw and feared. He 
pulled her close and caught her 
eyes in his own. “Norma, you have 
got to promise me that no matter 
what happens, you won’t get into 
another one of those boxes so you 
can be with him.” 

The thought was entirely new 
to her. Her voice was much 
lower. She frowned as if to see 
him better and said: “Get into 
one of those boxes? Oh, no — no, 
I’m not sick, yet. I only have to 
have shots for my nerves. A 
corpsman comes and gives them 
to me. He’ll be here soon. It’s only 
if you can’t not-care; I mean, if 
you have to stay involved, like 
he does, that you need the inter- 
rupter circuits instead of the tran- 
quilizer shots. You don’t get into 



one of those boxes just for fear,” 
she said. 

He had forgotten that; he had 
more than forgotten it — there 
were apparently things in the 
world that had made him be sure, 
for a moment, that it really was 
fear. 

He did not like hallucinating. 
He did not have any way of de- 
pending on himself if he had 
lapses like that. 

“Norma, how do I look to you?” 
he said rapidly. 

She was still frowning at him 
in that way. “You look about the 
same as always,” she said. 

He left her quickly — he had 
never thought, in conniving for 
this assignment with the letter 
crackling in his pocket, that he 
would leave her so quickly. And 
he went to his accommodation, 
crossing the raw, still untracked 
and unsheathed echoing shaft of 
the tunnel this near the face, with 
the labor battalion squads filing 
back and forth and the rubble 
carts rumbling. And in the morn- 
ing he set out. He crawled into 
the weapons carrier, and was 
lifted up to a hidden opening that 
had been made for it during the 
night. He started the engine and, 
lying flat on his stomach in the 
tiny cockpit, peering through the 
cat’s-eye viewports, he slid out 
onto the surface of the mountain 
and so became the first of his 
generation to advance into this 



18 



GALAXY 



territory that did not any more be- 
long to Man. 

Ill 

^T^HE interior of the weapons 
carrier was padded to protect 
him from the inevitable jounces 
and collisions. So it was hot. And 
the controls were crude; the car- 
rier moved from one foot to 
another, like a turtle, and there 
were levers for each of his hands 
and feet to control. He sweated 
and panted for breath. 

No other machine could pos- 
sibly have climbed down the face 
of that mountain and then begun 
its heaving, staggering progress 
toward the spaceship’s nearest leg. 
It could not afford to leave tracks. 
And it would, when it had covered 
the long miles of open country 
that separated it from its first 
destination, have to begin another 
inching, creeping journey of fifty- 
five miles, diagonally up the 
broadening, extensible pillar of 
the leg. 

It stumbled forward on pseudo- 
pods — enormous hollow pads of 
tough, transparent plastic, molded 
full of stress-channels that curled 
them to fit the terrain, when they 
were stiffened in turn by com- 
pressed colorless fluid. Shifting 
its weight from one of these to 
another, the carrier duck-walked 
from one shadow to another as 
Runner, writhing with muscle 



cramps, guided it at approximate- 
ly the pace of a drunken man. 

But it moved forward. 

After the first day Runner was 
ready to believe that the ship’s 
radar systems were not designed 
to track something that moved 
so close to the ground and so 
slowly. The optical detection 
system — which Intelligence re- 
spected far more than it did 
radar; there were dozens of 
countered radar-proof missiles to 
confirm them — also did not seem 
to have picked him up. 

He began to feel he might see 
Norma again. Thinking of that 
babbling stranger in Compton’s 
accommodation, he began to feel 
he might someday see Norma 
again. 

When he was three days out, he 
passed within a hundred yards of 
a cluster of mining-machines. 
They paid him no attention, and 
he laughed, cackling inside his 
egg. He knew that if he had 
safely come so close to an exten- 
sion of the ship — an extension 
that could have stepped over and 
crushed him with almost no extra 
expenditure — then his chances 
were very good. He knew he 
cackled. But he knew the Army’s 
drones were watching, unobtrus- 
ively, for signs of his extinction 
or breakdown. Not finding them, 
they were therefore giving Comp- 
ton and Headquarters the nega-

tive good news that he had not 
yet failed. At Headquarters, other 
Special Division personnel would 
be beginning to hope. They had 
been the minority party in the 
conflicts there for as long as they 
had been in existence at all. 

But it did not matter, he 
thought as he lay up that night 
and sipped warm water from the 
carrier’s tank. It didn’t matter 
what party was winning. Surely 
even Compton would not be in- 
furiated by a premature end to 
the war. And there were plenty 
of people at Headquarters who 
had fought for Compton not be- 
cause they were convinced his 
was the only way, but only be- 
cause his was a way that seemed 
sure. If slow. Or as sure as any 
way could be. 

It came to Runner, for the 
first time in his life, that any 
race, in whatever straits, willing 
to expend so much of its resources 
on what was really not a surety 
at all, must be desperate beyond 
all reason. 

He cackled again. He knew he 
cackled. He smiled at himself for 
it. 

^1 ■'HE ship’s leg was sunken 
through the ground down to 
its anchorage among the deep 
rock layers sloping away from the 
mountains. It was, at ground level, 
so far across that he could not 
see past it. It was a wall of 



streaked and overgrown metal 
curving away from him, and only 
by shifting to one of the side view- 
ports could he make out its ap- 
parent limits from where he now 
was. 

Looking overhead, he saw it 
rise away from him, an inverted 
pylon thrust into the ground at an 
angle, and far, far above him, in 
the air toward which that angle 
pointed, something large and 
vague rested on that pylon. Ob- 
scured by mist and cloud, dis- 
torted by the curvature of the 
tiny lens through which he was 
forced to look at it, it was nothing 
meaningful. He reasoned the py- 
lon led up to the ship. He could 
not see the ship; he concentrated 
on the pylon. 

Gingerly, he extended a pseu- 
dopod. It touched the metal of 
the ship, through which the sta- 
bilizing field ran. There was an 
unknown danger here, but it 
hadn’t seemed likely to Intelli- 
gence that the field would affect 
non-metallic substances. 

It didn’t. The pseudopod 
touched the metal of the ship, 
and nothing uptoward happened. 
He drew it back, and cycled an 
entirely new fluid through the 
pseudopods. Hairline excretory 
channels opened on their soles, 
blown clean by the pressure. The 
pads flattened and increased in 
area. He moved forward toward 
the pylon again, and this time he 



20 



GALAXY 



began to climb it, held by air 
pressure on the pads and the sur- 
face tension on their wet soles. 
He began, then, at the end of a 
week’s journey, to climb upon the 
ship no other aggression of Man’s 
had ever reached. By the time he 
was a thousand feet up, he dared 
look only through the fore ports. 

Now he moved in a universe 
of sound. The leg thrummed and 
quivered, so gently that he 
doubted anyone in the ship could 
feel it. But he was not in the ship; 
he was where the thrumming was. 
It invaded his gritted teeth and 
put an intolerable itching deep 
into his ears. This fifty-five miles 
had to be made without stop for 
rest; he could not, in fact, take 
his hands from the controls. He 
was not sure but what he 
shouldn’t be grateful — - he would 
have gouged his ears with his 
nails, surely, if he had been free 
to work at them. 

He was past laughter of any 
kind now — but exultation sus- 
tained him even when, near the 
very peak of his climb, he came 
to the rat guard. 

TTE had studied this problem 
with a model. No one had 
tried to tell him what it might be 
like to solve it at this altitude, 
with the wind and mist upon him. 

The rat guard was a collar of 
metal, cone-shaped and inverted 
downward, circling the leg. The 



leg here was several miles in di- 
ameter; the rat guard was a 
canopy several yards thick and 
several hundred feet wide from 
its joining at the leg to its lip. It 
was designed to prevent exactly 
what was happening - — ■ the at- 
tempted entry of a pest. 

Runner extended the carrier’s 
pseudopoda as far and wide as 
they would go. He pumped more 
coagulant into the fluid that 
leaked almost imperceptibly out 
of their soles, and began to make 
his way, head-downward, along 
the descending slope of the rat 
guard’s outer face. The carrier 
swayed and stretched at the plas- 
tic membranes. He neutralized 
the coagulant in each foot in turn, 
slid it forward, fastened it again, 
and proceeded. After three hours 
he was at the lip, and dangling 
by the carrier’s forelegs until he 
had succeeded in billowing one 
of rear pads onto the lip as well. 

And when he had, by this 
patient trial and error, scrambled 
successfully onto the rat guard’s 
welcome upward face, he found 
that he was not past laughing 
after all. He shouted it; the car- 
rier’s interior frothed with it, and 
even the itching in his ears was 
lost. Then he began to move up- 
ward again. 

Not too far away, the leg en- 
tered the ship’s hull. There was a 
opening at least as large as the 
carrier needed. It was only a well; 



FOR LOVE 



21 



up here, the gleaming pistons that 
controlled the extension of the 
leg hung burnished in the gloom, 
but there was no entry to the 
ship itself. Nor did he need or 
want it. 

He had reasoned long ago that 
whatever inhabited this ship must 
be as tired, as anxious, as beset as 
any human being. He needed no 
new miseries to borrow. He 
wanted only to find a good place 
to attach his bomb, set the fuse 
and go. Before the leg, its muscles 
cut, collapsed upon the aliens’ 
hope of ever returning to what- 
ever peace they dreamed of. 

When he climbed out of the 
carrier, as he had to, to attach the 
bomb, he heard one noise that 
was not wind-thrum or the throb 
of internal machinery. It was a 
persistent, nerve-torn ululation, 
faint but clear, deep inside the 
ship and with a chilling quality of 
endurance. 

He hurried back down the leg; 
he had only four days to get clear 
— that is, to have a hope of get- 
ting clear — and he hurried too 
much. At the rat guard’s lip, he 
had to hang by his heels and cast 
the fore pads under. He thought 
he had a grip, but he had only 
half a one. The carrier slipped, 
jerked and hung dangling by one 
pad. It began to slide back down 
the short distance to the lip of 
the guard, rippling and twisting as 
parts of its sole lost contact and 



other parts had to take up the 
sudden drag. 

TTE poured coagulant into the 
pad, and stopped the awful 
series of sticks and slips. He 
slapped the other pads up into 
place and levered forward, for- 
getting how firmly that one pad 
had been set in his panic. He felt 
resistance, and then remembered, 
but by then the pull of the other 
three pads had torn the carrier 
forward and there was a long rip 
through which stress fluid and 
coagulant dripped in a turgid 
stream. 

He came down the last ten 
miles of the leg like a runaway 
toboggan on a poorly surfaced 
slide, the almost flaccid pads turn- 
ing brown and burnt, their plastic 
soft as jelly. He left behind him a 
long, slowly evaporating smear of 
fluid and, since no one had 
thought to put individual shut- 
offs in the cross-valving system 
between the pads, he came down 
with no hope of ever using the 
carrier to get back to the moun- 
tains. 

It was worse than that. In the 
end, he crashed into the indented 
ground at the base of the leg and, 
for all the interior padding, the 
drive levers bludgeoned him and 
broke bones for him. He lay in 
the wreck with only a faint aware- 
ness of anything but his pain. He 
could not even know whether the 



FOR LOVE 



23 



carrier, with its silent power sup- 
ply, still as much as half hid him 
or whether that had broken, too. 

It hadn’t broken, but he was 
still there when the bomb ex- 
ploded; it was only a few hours 
afterward that he came out of his 
latest delirium and found that the 
ground had been stirred and the 
carrier was lying in a new position. 

He pried open the hatch — not 
easily or painlessly — and looked 
out. 

The ship hadn’t fallen. The leg 
had twitched in the ground — 
it was displaced by several hun- 
dred yards, and raw earth clung 
to it far overhead. It had changed 
its angle several degrees toward 
vertical and was much less deeply 
sunken into the ground. But the 
ship had not fallen. 

He fell back into the carrier 
and cried because the ship hadn’t 
come down and crushed him. 

IV 

^ j ■'HE carrier had to be aban- 
doned. Even if the pads had 
been usable, it was three-quarters 
buried in the upheaval the leg 
had made when it stirred. The 
machine. Runner thought con- 
temptuously, had failed, while a 
man could be holed and broken 
and heal himself nevertheless. 

He had very good proof of that, 
creeping back toward the moun- 
tains. Broken badly enough, a 



man might not heal himself into 
what he had been. But he would 
heal into something. 

For a time he had to be very 
wary of the mining machines, for 
there had been a frenzied increase 
in their activity. And there was 
the problem of food and water. 
But he was in well-watered coun- 
try. The comings and goings of 
the machines had churned the 
banks of the Platte River into a 
series of sinks and swamps with- 
out making it impossible for a 
thirsty, crawling man to drink. 
And he had his rations from the 
carrier while the worst of the 
healing took place. After that, 
when he could already scuttle on 
his hands and one knee, he was 
able to range about. In crawling, 
he had discovered the great va- 
riety of burrowing* animals that 
live beneath the eye of ordinary 
man; once he had learned which 
ones made bolt-holes and which 
could be scooped out of the traps 
of their own burrows he began 
to supply himself with a fair 
amount of protein. 

The ship, and its extensions, 
did him no harm. Some of this 
was luck, when he was in the 
zones traversed by the machines 
as they went to and from the 
ship. But after he had taken up 
a systematic trek back along the 
North Platte, and presumably 
ought to have stopped being regis- 
tered in the ship’s detectors as 



24 



GALAXY 



an aimless animal, he was appar- 
ently protected by his coloration, 
which was that of the ground, 
and again by his slow speed and 
ability to hug the terrain. Even 
without psuedopods and a fusion 
bomb to carry, his speed was no 
better than that. 

When several months had 
passed he was able to move in a 
half-upright walk that was an un- 
relenting parody of a skip and a 
jump, and he was making fair 
time. But by then he was well up 
into the beginnings of the Medi- 
cine Bows. 

He thought that even though 
the ship still stood, if he could 
reach Norma soon enough she 
might still not be too lost. 

Not only the ship but the Army 
drones had missed him, until he 
was almost back to the now re- 
filled exit from which he and the 
carrier had launched themselves. 
The passages were hurriedly un- 
blocked — every cubic yard of 
rubble that did not have to be 
dispersed and camouflaged at the 
pithead represented an enormous 
saving of expenditure — and he 
was hauled back into the com- 
pany of his fellow creatures. 

TTIS rescue was nearly unendur- 
-^■*-able. He lay on a bed in the 
Aid Station and listened to Comp- 
ton’s delight. 

“They went wild when I told 
them at Headquarters, Colonel. 



You’d already been given a post- 
humous Medal of Honor. I don’t 
know what they’ll do now you’re 
available for parades. And you 
certainly deserve them. I had 
never had such a moment in my 
life as when I saw what you’d 
done to the ship.” 

And while Compton talked, 
Norma — Norma with no at- 
tention to spare for Runner; a 
Norma bent forward, peering at 
the dials of Compton’s cabinet, 
one hand continually twitching 
toward the controls — that Norma 
reached with her free hand, took 
a photograph out of a file folder 
clipped to the side of the cabinet 
and held the picture, unseeing, 
for Runner to look at while she 
continued her stewardship of 
Compton’s dials. The cadet had 
been replaced. The wife was 
homemaking in the only way she 
could. 

The ship no longer pointed 
directly away from the ground, 
nor was she equally balanced on 
the quadruped of her landing 
jacks. The bombed leg dangled 
useless, its end trailing in the 
ground, and the ship leaned away 
from it. 

“When the bomb went off,” 
Compton was explaining, “she did 
the only thing she could to save 
herself for the time being. She 
partially retracted the opposite 
leg to balance herself.” 

Norma reached out and ad- 



FOR LOVE

justed one of the controls. The 
flush paled out of Compton’s face, 
and his voice sank toward the 
toneless whisper Runner remem- 
bered. 

“I was always afraid she would 
do that. But the way she is now, 
I know — I know that when I 
undermine another leg, she’ll fall! 
And she can’t get away from me. 
She’ll never take off with that 
leg dragging. I never had a mo- 
ment in my life like the moment 
I had when I saw her tilt. Now I 
know there’s an end in sight. All 
of us here know there’s an end 
in sight, don’t you, Norma? The 
ship’ll puzzle out how you did it. 
Runner, and she’ll defend against 
another such attempt, but she 
can’t defend against the ground 
opening up under her. We’ll run 
the tunnel right through the rock 
layers she rests on, get under- 
neath, mine out a pit for the leg 
to stumble into and blow the 
rock — she’ll go down like a tree 
in the wind. Runner. Thirty years 
— well, possibly forty, now that 
we’ve got to reach a farther leg — 
and we’ll have her! We’ll swallow 
her up. Runner!” 

Runner was watching Norma. 
Her eyes darted over the dials 
and not once, though most of the 
gestures were abortive, did her 
hands stop their twitching toward 
the controls. When she did touch 



them, her hands were sure; she 
seemed quite practiced; Runner 
could calculate that she had prob- 
ably displaced the cadet very 
soon after he had bombed the 
ship. 

“You were right. General,” he 
said. “I never got the proper per- 
spective to see all that. It was 
acute of you to bring me that 
drone’s photograph. I never knew 
what an effect I’d produced until 
I got back here.” 

“Yes!” Compton laughed into 
Runner’s eyes, and Norma tender- 
ly adjusted the controls to keep 
the laugh from killing him forty 
years too soon. “It’s all a matter 
of perspective!” 

T> UNNER comforted himself 
with the thought that the 
aliens in the ship had also gone 
mad. And he thought it was a 
very human thing to do — he 
thought, with some pride, that it 
was perhaps the last human thing 
— for him to refuse the doctors 
who offered to give him artificial 
replacements for the hopelessly 
twisted legs he had come back 
with. 

“You will not!” he snapped, 
while up in the bunker, all un- 
imaginable to him, Norma kissed 
Compton’s face and said: “You 
will get her — you will!”

The golden guardians denied 
mankind the stars. 

They were irresistible 
in their might , , , and 
they were something more! 



66\W7HY did you come creep- 
ing into the house last 
night like a thief?” Mrs. Sanchez 
asked her son. 

Lithe, dark Roberto set down 
his breakfast coffee and smiled up 
at her. “Ah, Mama, you are the 
owl. I was certain I moved quiet 
as moonlight.” 

“I always hear the sounds of 
my children. Even the little one 
when he stirs in his grave. It is 
the way of a mother.” She drew a 
cup of coffee and sat with them 
at the table in the small kitchen 
patio. 

“The hour was late,” Roberto 
said, “and I did not wish to dis- 
turb you with greetings that 
would keep until morning. You 
sleep little enough as it is. Though 
the hard days are gone, the sun 
still rises after you.” 

Roberto’s father looked up 
from his newspaper. “She will al- 
ways be full of the old ways,” he 
said with fond gruffness. “For her 
there is no change. Our children 
have grown proud and fine and 
freed us from bondage to the soil. 
Yet she still behaves as a peon. 
To her we still toil in the fields 
of the patron, bent with exhaus- 
tion over the planting or harvest- 
ing consoles, struggling to control 
the many field machines. She 
bakes her own bread. The market 
vegetables do not please her so 
she chafes her hands with the but- 
tons and switches of a garden. 



THE LAMPS OF THE ANGELS

And a robot to scrub the floors 
she will not hear of. Perhaps she 
thinks it would be prettier than 
she and I might run off with it to 
Mexico City.” 

“Foolish old man,” Mrs. San- 
chez said with mock severity, 
“you have lost even the memory 
of what it is to run.” 

“Mama,” Roberto said, “I have 
a present for you.” 

Something of an eager little girl 
looked out of the wise eyes. 

“I have no need of a present,” 
she said but her eyes searched the 
leafy little patio. “All I ask as a 
gift is for you to come out of the 
sky for a little while and marry.” 
Roberto smiled. “Have not my 
brothers and sisters given you 
grandchildren enough? And what 
woman will marry the captain of 
a space vessel? With my journeys 
to Jupiter and Saturn and outer- 
most Nyx I would forever be a 
stranger to my children and an 
occasional guest to my wife.” 
From under his napkin he drew 
forth a small silvery box. “Mama, 
your present.” 

She gasped with delight when 
she opened it. In a black velvet 
womb nested a strange glittering 
jewel suspended on a delicate, 
spider-strand, silver chain. 
“Roberto!” she exclaimed with a 
feeble remonstrance. 

“Like the others I have brought 
it is not expensive,” Roberto said. 
“The stone is a common one on 



Nyx. But it is very beautiful and 
when I found it I thought of you.” 

A BELL-LIGHT flashed on the 
kitchen console. Mrs. Sanchez 
went to it as a shallow dish slid 
from the oven. She set it, sizzling 
softly, on the table. “And a pres- 
ent for you,” she said. “Your 
favorite, quinquanos. Fresh from 
Venus yesterday, or so the vendor 
tells me.” She shrugged dubiously. 
“In this sinful age even the ma- 
chines lie.” 

“But, Mama, the money I send 
is not to be wasted on me! These 
are so expensive.” 

“And small,” Mrs. Sanchez said. 
“Why is there not a garden manu- 
factured that can be programmed 
for quinquanos so that I might 
grow my own?” 

“Because five fortunes could 
not pay for it,” Mr. Sanchez said. 
“Try as they might, such delica- 
cies come only through the grace 
of God and not General Electric.” 
He set aside his newspaper and 
accepted another coffee. “Does 
this not complete your collec- 
tion?” he asked his wife. “Roberto 
has brought for you a stone from 
every planet he has touched. 
Even the moon and the grand 
asteroids.” 

“I know not how many worlds 
there are in the sun’s family. But 
if it is done, then it is done.” She 
tried to make her words uncon- 
cerned but there was a shadow of 



28 



GALAXY 



regret across them. “The stones 
are beautiful. But they are frivo- 
lous and the end to them is not to 
be mourned.” 

“Ha!” Mr. Sanchez snorted. 
“She pretends, the sly one, she 
does not care. But I know how 
she delights in them, these gifts 
from her son. I have seen her in a 
stolen moment open the box and 
gaze with pleasure upon them. 
And when we go to the opera in 
Mexico City it is one of your 
single-stoned necklaces which 
adorns her simple black dress. 
She will have no other ornarnent.” 
“I no longer have a husband in 
this house,” Mrs. Sanchez said, 
“only an old woman whose mouth 
talks away the day.” 

“Old woman, eh?” Mr. Sanchez 
leered and playfully slapped his 
wife on her backside. 

She pretended to be shocked. 
“In front of the child! But what 
can one expect from an evil old 
lecher?” 

The three of them laughed and 
basked in the warmth of their 
blood bonds. Mr. Sanchez re- 
sumed his coffee. “Is it really 
done, Roberto? Have you taken 
cargoes from all twelve planets?” 
“Yes.” 

“Even the one just beyond 
Pluto? Is it Oceanus or Atlas? I 
can never remember which it is 
. but for a long while you were 
missing one of them.” 

“I have them all. I am still a 



young man and yet I have taken 
my ship to all the planets in many 
voyages. But of course that is not 
unusual,” he lectured, for he knew 
that was what they wanted, “for 
in the thousand years since man 
first stepped forth on the moon 
the solar commerce has so in- 
creased that there are hardly 
enough suitable men for the ships 
that bridge the now familiar 
worlds. So familiar, I could fly to 
the rings of Saturn or to dark Nyx 
in my slumber.” 

“Then you also must also feel a 
sadness because there will be no 
more stones to pluck from a new 
planet,” Mr. Sanchez said. “Per- 
haps there is a thirteenth yet to 
be found.” 

“No, Papa. It is certain. There 
are no more children of our sun. 
But I am not sad. The stones are 
not finished. Mama shall have 
other pretty baubles to be caged 
in fine silver or gold and hung 
about her neck.” 

IVTRS. Sanchez was program- 
ming a day of cooking and 
baking on the autochef. At her 
son’s words her hands poised in 
mid-flight over the console. She 
did not quite comprehend but an 
intuitive wisp of alarm darkened 
her face. 

She turned to her husband, as 
if for some reassurance that her 
dread was of no substance. 

Mr. Sanchez said in perplexity, 



THE LAMPS OF THE ANGELS

“I do not understand, Roberto. If 
there are no more planets — ■” 

“In this system!” Roberto said. 

Neither of his parents said a 
word. They stared at him and 
waited. 

“In a few days it will be offi- 
cially announced,” Roberto said. 
“With the perfection of the new 
Korenyik propulsion, a starship 
will be built. A starship! And I 
have been selected to take it 
through the other space to Alpha 
Centauri.” 

Mr. Sanchez embraced his son. 
“Roberto, I am so proud.” He 
turned to his wife. “Is it not a 
great — ” He stopped at the look 
of her. 

“This Alpha Centauri,” she said, 
pronouncing it badly, “it is a 
planet?” 

“It is a star. Mama. Like our 
sun. It may have a family of 
planets. It will be exciting to dis- 
cover them.” 

“Why?” she asked with a 
mother’s quiet challenge. 

The word echoed in Roberto’s 
mind — why? The very core of his 
being strained to shout out why. 
Space was why! Each blazing star 
was a compelling, beckoning 
finger. Every constellation a cov- 
enant with his heart. And some- 
where out in the majestic, wheel- 
ing Galaxy his soul wandered, 
waiting for him to come. 

“Mama, I will show you why,” 
he replied as quietly. “As I prom- 



ised Papa the last time, I have 
borrowed from the company a 
star projector. This time you must 
put aside the household and 
watch and listen and learn some- 
thing about the universe out of 
which my life and my dreams are 
made. Of all your children I am 
the only stranger to you. And be- 
fore I go out to the stars I want 
you to know something of that 
which fills my heart.” 

He went to his room and re- 
turned with a foot-square case 
which he set on a table in the liv- 
ing area. He pressed a stud. A 
transparent globe inflated over it 
to a four foot diameter. He 
dimmed the lights, manipulated 
the controls and a tiny sun 
burned in the center of the globe. 
Another adjustment brought into 
view the solar planets orbiting 
around it. The device was an edu- 
cational tool; it projected as de- 
sired, within the envelope of gas, 
three-dimensional mockups of the 
solar system, star clusters and gal- 
axies that moved almost as incan- 
descently beautiful as the origi- 
nals. 

Mrs. Sanchez was delighted 
with the views of the solar system 
and the surface scenes of the vari- 
ous planets. She had as much gen- 
eral knowledge of the planets as 
she had of India or France — 
which had all come to her through 
the distorting medium of televi- 
sion dramas. The moon had ob- 



30 



GALAXY 



servatories and mad scientists; 
India had elephants and sinister 
maharajas; Mars had deserts and 
fragile ghost people; Venus had 
quinquanos and swamp dragons; 
and France was overflowing with 
sin. 

Roberto did not utilize the 
projector narrative. He explained 
with his own intense words as he 
took his parents across the gulf to 
the constellations. He skipped 
about the Galaxy, astounding 
them with the sheer billions of 
stars. He insinuated the possibil- 
ity of millions of inhabited 
planets and then he flung them 
across the abyss of space to view 
the Local Group of the Milky 
Way, its sister Andromeda and 
the satellite galaxies. Then he 
plunged them into infinity for a 
time-lost glimpse of the billion 
other galaxies thus far discovered. 

'■| ■'HE globe deflated, the lights 
went on and Roberto leaned 
toward his mother. “Does not the 
thought of all this catch at your 
heart a little?” 

There was an uncertainty in 
her voice that Roberto missed be- 
cause he was so intent upon her 
answer. “All those stars,” she said. 
“Something like that I saw once 
on the television — about strange 
people who lived on those stars. 
I did not like it very much. Per- 
haps because it is not true.” 

“Not true?” Roberto echoed. 



“Yesterday, yes. Today, not quite. 
Tomorrow . your own son is 
going to the stars!” 

“It is beyond my understanding 
why men cannot be content to re- 
main where they were meant to 
be.” 

“But the stars were meant for 
us. They are our destiny!” Rober- 
to realized he was speaking too 
loudly. 

Mrs. Sanchez looked squarely 
at her son. Her words were meas- 
ured and solemn like some soli- 
tary, tolling bell. “If God meant us 
to be on those stars he would 
have put us there. Roberto, take 
care. Listen to the word of your 
mother. I have not the cleverness 
of my children but I know things 
here.” She touched her hand over 
her heart. “It may be as you say, 
all the millions of great .stars. But 
they are God’s high places and I 
tell you, my son, whoever dares 
violate them will be struck down.” 

“But, Mama! In ancient times, 
when man first took to the air, 
there were those who proclaimed 
man presumed too much and 
would be punished. And a thou- 
sand years ago there were people 
who spoke as you do when man 
first went into space. They too 
said God gave us the earth and to 
covet the moon and the planets 
was a grievous sin.” 

Mrs. Sanchez shrugged. “There 
are always the fanatics. Your 
mama is not one of them. God 



32 



GALAXY 



gave men the sun and the moon 
and the planets and set them 
apart from the stars for him to 
work out his salvation. It is natu- 
ral and right.” 

“And he did not give us the 
stars also?” 

“In the sky He put them as a 
testament to His glory. You have 
shaken my poor head with the 
measure of their distance. But it 
serves to show that they would 
not have been placed out of reach 
if they were intended for us to 
have.” 

“But Mama, soon they will no 
longer be out of reach. Your own 
son will go to the first one in a 
great new ship.” 

Mrs. Sanchez turned troubled 
eyes on her son. “I will pray for 
you.” She averted her face- and 
would no longer look directly at 
him. 

Roberto angrily snatched up 
the star projector and went to his 
room. 

His father followed. “You must 
understand,” he said, “your 
mother is a simple woman. She 
would rather think of the stars as 
the lamps of the angels than the 
huge blazing spheres that they 
are.” 

“I do understand,” Roberto said 
bitterly. “I have heard her words 
a thousand times from as many 
mouths. They have sounded 
through history and are chains 
meant to bind man to his few 



worlds. It is the eternal voice of 
the heavy, peasant mind which 
tries to shout down every soaring 
dream of mankind.” 

“Your words are too hard,” his 
father said. 

Roberto’s lips curled to say 
something cruel but he refrained, 
not wanting to hurt this fine, little 
man whose blood was his own. 

“Yes,” Roberto said, softening, 
“for after all there are always the 
minds which struggle free and lift 
us up. They have carried us to 
the threshold of the stars. And the 
time will come, a thousand years 
perhaps, when we will be ready to 
try for our sister Galaxy, Andfo- 
meda.” Roberto smiled. “Of course 
it is certain we will still have our 
simple folk who will warn us and 
tell us to beware; that it is not the 
will of the Almighty that we 
leave the Milky Way; that we 
presume too much and we will be 
struck down. And — ” Roberto 
stopped in mild surprise. He saw 
in his father’s expression the re- 
flection of his mother’s apprehen- 
sion. 

Roberto turned away sadly and 
began to pack away the star pro- 
jector. 

Someday, he thought, in spite 
of the little minds, we will have 
one of these that will show the 
other space as commonly as our 
own. And all their phantom angels 
and devils shall not bar man from 
the universe. 



THE LAMPS OF THE ANGELS

passed. 

-* The ship was launched. 

Six long years, Roberto thought. 
Long years of preparation, testing 
and training. Hard, bone-wearying 
hours of familiarization and 
shakedown with nerve-straining, 
experimental jumps into the other 
space. Now at last they were in 
that other space — that strange, 
blazing white elsewhere that Kor- 
enyik had given to mankind as 
the trail to the stars— the Horse- 
head Nebula clear before them. 

Six years of frantic activity . 
and now he was launched and 
there was nothing to do in transit 
but wait. Six years since he had 
been to the little sun-faded stone 
house near Mexico City and felt 
the warm blood-tug of his parents. 
Papa now dead and Mama with 
her dark forebodings of angels 
and God. 

He gazed at the dark screens in 
the starship and wondered what 
he might see if they were on. 

In the intense, brilliant region 
under the vault of heaven the two 
great creatures, their golden cor- 
uscating substance flung across 
the white space, sensed their com- 
ing. My-Ky-El limned the ship 
with a golden halo and knew the 
creatures within. He linked with 
Ra-Fa-El and they communed in 
soaring crystal carillions of 
thought. 

— they are come from the 



Black Space, Hell, the brood of 
Satan has broken its bonds and 
penetrated the barrier! 

— how is it so? the Fallen were 
shrivelled of substance and ener- 
gy; shorn of motion and thrust 
down into the Black Space with 
no memory of their origin 

— nevertheless they are here in 
a devious shape and White Space 
is once again threatened 
— they must be annulled NOW! 

!!! A-ROORRR-UH !!! A-ROO- 
RRR-UH!!! 

The Klaxon howled out the 
alarm. The control board erupted 
into a swiftly spreading plague of 
red warning lights, indicating the 
Korenyik Matrix Units were be- 
ing subjected to incredible strain. 

Roberto punched a row of 
screen tabs. The normal-space 
view screens showed nothing. He 
punched in the E-screens. He 
gasped at the sight, struck with an 
awful dread. Great golden mists 
were clustering, bursting, swirling 
and spiralling in the blinding 
whiteness. They wreathed the 
ship, and the KM units sobbed as 
they strained against the rending 
golden energies. Roberto fought 
against odd, thick fear that tried 
to prostrate him on the deck and 
make him grovel in utter, abject 
terror. This icy dread that freezes 
my blood is not of my making, 
Roberto thought. With a desper- 
ate effort of will he hurled his 



34 



GALAXY 



leaden fingers at the keys and 
punched in the Omega beams. 
Eyes burning, he saw ashen 
whorls spin through the golden 
mists and crystal screams seemed 
to splinter in his mind. 

For a fragment of time the KM 
units ceased their belabored sob- 
bing and the fear drained from 
Roberto. In the instant he 
slammed the jump bar and they 
were in their own Black Space. 

“We’ll never get home this 
way,” the navigator said. He was 
trembling with shock. 

Roberto struggled to keep his 
own body from quivering. “I will 
take us home. We will dodge in 
and out of the two spaces. The 
danger seems unable to follow. 
Can you navigate such a course?” 

r I ■'HE navigator was trembling 
violently and he began to sob. 
“What were they? So ma — magni- 
ficent . and . terrifying . 
like great golden angels . .” 

“SHUT UP! SHUT UP!” Ro- 
berto screamed, his control shat- 
tering. He leaned to the limit of 
his pad straps and struck once 
and again at the navigator. Rober- 
to pulled his hands back and 
crowded his anger and fear to 
the back of his mind. “Can you 
skip us home?” he again de- 
manded of the navigator. 

The man’s voice was steadier. 
“I’ll need three minutes in black 
each time to compute position 



and plot the next jump. But, yes, 
I can do it.” 

“I make you a gift of three 
hours right now.” And perhaps 
more we will need, Roberto 
thought, to recover the courage 
lor venturing again into the White 
Space. And my navigator spoke of 
angels but where were the faces 
and wings? And why did I also 
think of angels almost as if I felt 
a nebulous ancient memory of 
them? And do the others feel as 
my navigator and I? 

They did! Roberto had gone 
around the ship carefully ques- 
tioning his men. No matter how 
delicately he inquired, whenever 
he touched upon what they might 
have seen on the E-screen the fear 
would come into their eyes. Some 
spoke directly of heavenly crea- 
tures, others embarrassedly ad- 
mitted such impressions and a 
few averted their eyes and denied 
such thoughts. But the words of 
them all were edged with terror 
and awe. 

Roberto and his shaken crew 
were slowly regaining confidence. 
They had made a jump into the 
White Space and remained there 
for some hours before being 
frightened back into the Black by 
a vague alarm. Nothing more than 
a quivering needle and a lighter 
patch on an E-screen; but they 
had remained hidden in Black for 
many hours and now they were 
ready to make another jump. 



THE LAMPS OF THE ANGELS 



35 



Roberto pressed the jump bar, 
throwing them into White 
Space . and the golden fury 
struck! ill A-ROORRR-UH!!!A 
ROORRR-UH!!! The board 
blazed red. There were screams 
On the intercom. There was heat 
and savage bucking with a crash- 
ing and screeching tear of ultra- 
steel. The E-screens flared with a 
terrible molten dancing of golden 
fire. Roberto punched in the 
Omega beams in a shell pattern, 
cut them and snapped on the 
force shield in full crackling 
power. It flared greenly against 
the golden furies. The reactive 
thrust slammed hard against the 
hull and the ship went hurtling 
end over end. Roberto slapped the 
jump bar but the ship remained 
trapped in the White Space. Blue 
energy licked along the heaving 
bulkheads and decks. There were 
niore cries and an odor of 
Scorched flesh, and the corpse of 
his first officer went spinning 
limply through the control cabin. 
Something wrenched loose and 
Crunched heavily on Roberto’s 
leg before bouncing away. Too 
niuch red! Roberto cried within, 
looking from his crimsoning leg 
to the carmine lights of the board. 
Re pounded his fists on the un- 
responsive jump bar. “Mama,” he 
■Whisijered in agony, and suddenly 
Something connected, and the tor- 
tured ship tumbled shudderingly 
into Black Space. 



M rs. SANCHEZ sat in the twi- 
light with the darkened 
house at her back and unmoving- 
ly faced the mountains. She heard 
the jet whine of the taxi helicop- 
ter but could not see it because it 
landed in front 6f the house. She 
listened as the whine faded. And 
in the silence she heard an odd 
step that she could not recognize. 
“Mama.” 

The voice was different. There 
was no longer a smile under it. 
But it was Roberto’s. 

She did not answer, but as she 
stood the noise of her chair 
brought him limping toward her. 
She started to move to him but he 
stopped abruptly and she sud- 
denly felt a new bitter distance 
between them that mere steps 
could never cross. In the dusk she 
stared at his twisted leg. 

“Roberto,” she whispered sadly. 
“Call me Jacob,” he said harsh- 
ly. “I have wrestled with angels.” 
He thrust out his crippled leg. 
“. and behold a man wrestled 
with him till morning. And when 
he saw that he could not over- 
come him he touched the sinew of 
his thigh and forthwith it shrank!” 
With no triumph, but only a 
mother’s distressed remonstrance, 
Mrs. Sanchez softly wailed, “O 
Roberto, Roberto, I warned you. 
I told you.” 

“Yes, Mama, you told me,” he 
said. “But you did not tell me 
the thing most important. You did 



36 



GALAXY 



not tell me that we are devils!” 

She stared at him, uncompre- 
hending. 

“Yes, my fine, good Mama! 
With all your thoughts of heaven, 
we are a world of devils. How or 
why or from whence I do not yet 
know. But I am going back to 
the White Space to seek and I 
only come now to see you once 
more and say good-by . and 
. .” Roberto faltered and leaned 
toward her as if straining to see 
her face in the evening gloom that 
had almost deepened into night. 
“. and . ask your blessing.” 
The words were hardly more than 
a whisper. 

“Going back?” she said incredu- 
lously. 

“I must.” 

Anger was in her voice as she 
pointed to his leg. “Even with the 
mark of wrath you carry? You 
dare make more sacrilege?” 

She turned to go into the house. 
Roberto limped a few steps after 
her. “Mama, as you love me, your 
blessing! For your son.” 

She turned in the doorway, her 
face hard. “I can only pray for 
you.” 

Roberto watched her go inside. 
No light appeared and he knew 
she would be kneeling before the 
shelf of holy things in the small 
flickering light of the votive can- 
dle. He made his way to the front 
of the house to the waiting heli- 
taxi. He looked back at the house. 



This is no longer my home, he 
thought. And then, a moment 
later: Was it ever? 

He looked up at the stars and 
thought of the pure brilliance of 
White Space and the magnificent 
golden creatures. Why the sweet 
anguish in the depths of my being 
when I think of them and the 
white place? Why in spite of my 
fear am I drawn to it more than 
I am to this house which is my 
home? Home? 

Roberto climbed into the ma- 
chine and it moved upward a 
little closer to the stars before 
turning south.

NAMES IN THE SKY 

' I ■’HE story I have in mind is 
probably being told in Los 
Angeles with the Griffith Obser- 
vatory as its locale, in Chicago 
with reference to the Adler Plan- 
etarium and in any other city with 
reference to visitor’s night at the 
nearby astronomical observatory. 
I heard it for the first time at the 
Treptow Observatory east of Ber- 
lin. It goes like this: the visitor 
looks through the telescope at the 
moon, then at Jupiter. Then two 
or three well known stars are 



38 



GALAXY 



picked out to prove that a true 
star, even when seen through a 
telescope, still shows just as a 
pinpoint of light. The astronomer 
may say that Mars, unfortunately, 
can’t be observed right now but 
will reappear in a suitable loca- 
tion in the sky next November. 
And then the visitor says to an- 
other visitor: “I think I can un- 
derstand how they measure the 
distance to Jupiter and how they 
find out how big it is. I can imag- 
ine how they make calculations 
telling them when a planet will 
be visible. What I don’t under- 
stand is how they find out their 
names!” 

If you change the joke to the 
serious question of how a name 
is established you not only have 
a legitimate question but you also 
have a problem. The answer is, 
of course, that somebody, at some 
time, gave a name to a star or to 
something more local, like a cra- 
ter on the moon. But the names 
sometimes took hold and some- 
times did not. There are even a 
few cases where everybody would 
be quite willing to go along with 
the name favored by the discov- 
erer, provided we could be sure 
that we know which astronomical 
object he had in mind. Converse- 
ly, with some star names of Arab 
origin we know which star is 
meant but we cannot interpret 
the name. 

The names in the sky fall into 



two main categories: traditional 
names like those for the constel- 
lations, for a number of conspicu- 
ous stars and for the naked-eye 
planets; and names which have 
been bestowed more recently by 
their discoverers, the names of a 
few planets, the names of the 
asteroids and the names of visible 
features on the moon and on 
Mars. 

But even with the recent names 
some confusion is possible . and 
therefore exists. 

Let us begin with the simplest 
case, the names of comets. 

A good number of them do 
not have a “real” name at all. The 
“Comet of 1577” is just that; no 
name was given to it. If they do 
have names it is that of the dis- 
coverer. Biela’s comet is Biela’s 
comet because it was first ob- 
served by Wilhelm von Biela 
back in 1772. There is just one 
comet which has a name other 
than that of its discoverer and it 
happens to be the most famous 
of all of them: Halley’s comet. Dr. 
Edmond Halley did not discover 
it. He had compared the orbits of 
earlier comets, arrived at the con- 
clusion that several observations 
seemed to refer to the same comet 
and he predicted its return. 

While big comets are rare — 
we haven’t had a good one since 
the last passage of Halley’s comet 
in 1910 — comets of smaller size 
are not. Since several of them ap-

pear every year a special system 
was devised for them. At first 
they are listed as 1962a, 1962b, 
1962c and so forth, in order of 
their discovery. Early in the fol- 
lowing year the list is then re- 
arranged to read 1962 I, 1962 II, 
1962 III, etc., in order of their 
perihelion passages. Of course 
the name of the discoverer is at- 
tached too, and since one astrono- 
mer may discover more than one 
comet you might have a designa- 
tion like Whipple IV, which 
means that it was the fourth 
comet discovered by Fred L. 
Whipple. 

(Actually he discovered seven, 
last time I checked.) 

There is also a system for the 
naming of asteroids, the planet 
fragments which normally orbit 
the sun between the orbits of 
Mars and Jupiter. The first of 
them had been discovered during 
the New Year’s Night 1800-1801 
by Father Giuseppe Piazzi, S.J. 
He first thought it was a comet; it 
turned out to be a small planet in 
what up to that time had been 
considered a “gap” in the solar 
system. In fact, some two hundred 
years earlier Johannes Kepler had 
been so annoyed by the gap, 
which ruined his mathematical 
explanations, that he wrote Inter 
Jovetn et Martem planetam in- 
terposui, “between Jupiter and 
Mars I put a planet”. Now it had 
been found by Piazzi and was 



named Ceres. As will be explained 
later, astronomers had reasons to 
use names of the highest classical 
purity. 

The sequel to the story was 
that Ceres was lost for a while, 
but the observed positions en- 
abled Carl Friedrich Gauss to 
calculate (by means of a new 
method which he invented for the 
purpose) an ephemeris for the 
new planet. With the aid of the 
position predicted by Gauss, 
Heinrich Wilhelm Gibers, M. D., 
in Bremen, re-discovered Ceres 
during the New Year’s Night from 
1801 to 1802! Soon after Gibers 
discovered another small planet 
in the same former gap which 
was named Pallas. Two years 
later Karl Harding came up with 
a third one, which was named 
Juno, and in 1807 Gibers followed 
up with a fourth, to be named 
Vesta. 

By then the pattern was estab- 
lished. Asteroids received classi- 
cal female names. 

This would have been most sat- 
isfactory as a system if there had 
been not more than, say, five 
dozen asteroids. At first Greek 
and Latin classical names were 
easy. Number 7 became Iris, num- 
ber 27 was still Euterpe and num- 
ber 57 Mnemosyne. But soon 
both Homer’s Odyssey and 
Pliny’s Historia naturalis were ex- 
hausted. Gh, well, the Saga of 
Gudrun and the Nibelungenlied 



40 



GALAXY 



could be considered classical, too. 
Names like Gudrun and Kriem- 
hild began to invade the area 
populated by Leukothea and Kly- 
temnaistra and Polyhymnia. 
Right now there is probably an 
actual need for female names, 
even though all common modern 
names in all languages, from 
Anna via Gertrud to Marlene and 
Natasha have been used. If a 
philologist would prove tomorrow 
that there was a Carthaginian 
goddess Ilu, her name would be 
attached to an asteroid the day 
after tomorrow. 

There was some slight relief 
in 1898 when it was found that a 
newly discovered asteroid orbited 
partly inside the orbit of Mars. It 
was named Eros, a male name, to 
indicate that it differed from 
those in the by then very crowded 
“gap,” and it quickly became cus- 
tomary to name all asteroids 
which crossed the orbits of either 
Mars or Jupiter, or orbited outside 
the orbit of Jupiter or inside the 
orbit of Mars, after males. In that 
sub-section of asteroid names all 
names are still strictly classical. 
There is a large supply of classi- 
cal male names still available. 

'’■''HE names of the satellites of 
our solar system are now 
rather orderly but it wasn’t al- 
ways thus. Classical times, of 
course, knew only one satellite, 
that of Earth: Selene to the 



Greeks, Luna to the Romans. 
(The latter is the name for the 
moon in quite of a number of 
modern languages, including Rus- 
sian.) Our word moon is from 
the Anglo-Saxon mona (hence; 
month, in German Monat ) and 
the other Germanic languages de- 
rive their names from the same 
root, e.g. Maan in Dutch and 
Mond in German. When Galileo 
Galilei discovered the four large 
moons of Jupiter two problems 
came up simultaneously. In the 
first place, since there was now 
not only the moon but moons, a 
general term for “moons” was de- 
sirable. Johannes Kepler supplied 
this by coining the word “satellite” 
(from satellos, which means at- 
tendant.) But, Galilei felt, the 
moons of Jupiter should also have 
individual names. 

He wrote to Cosmo de Medici, 
Fourth Grand Duke of Tuscany, 
that they should be called the 
Medicea Sidera, the Medicean 
Stars, and suggested the specific 
names of members of the Medici 
family for them. To astronomers 
who were not Italians the name 
Medici simply did not have the 
exalted ring it had to Galilei and 
they kept silent on the proposal 
— - except Herr Mayr in Kulm- 
bach who called himself Simon 
Marius and who, being court as- 
tronomer to the Margrave of 
Brandenburg, suggested Sidera 
Brandenburgica. Marius, who 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



41 



claimed to have seen the moons 
of Jupiter earlier than Galilei — 
and who did discover the Great 
Nebula in Andromeda — realized 
after a discussion with Kepler 
that classical names were at least 
neutral, if not superior, and sug- 
gested naming the four major 
moons after four love affairs of 
Jove: lo, Europa, Ganymed and 
Callisto. With a long delay his 
suggestion was accepted even 
though, to this day, astronomers 
prefer to write J-I, J-II, J-III and 
J-IV. Galilei had started that by 
writing J. , J„ , J... and J . 

The system began to get into 
some trouble when E. E. Barnard, 
in 1892, discovered a fifth satel- 
lite of Jupiter which happened to 
orbit inside the four Galileian 
satellites. Barnard stuck to the 
designation J-V even though 
many names were proposed. Ca- 
mille Flammarion in France sug- 
gested Amalthea (Jupiter’s nurse- 
maid in mythology) which is 
slowly coming into use, but usu- 
ally with the parenthetical re- 
mark that it is “not official.” 
(Because it was suggested by 
somebody other than the discov- 
erer and not accepted by the dis- 
coverer.) Barnard’s insistence on 
the designation J-V did have the 
result that the additional moons 
of Jupiter were not given any 
names but are referred to as J-VI, 
J-VII and so forth up to J-XII. 

The outcome is that any list of 



Jupiter’s satellites looks wrong. If 
you arrange it in the numerical 
order, which is the order of dis- 
covery, the satellites form no pat- 
tern as regard to distance from 
the planet. If you arrange them in 
order of distance from the planet, 
the numerals are out of sequence. 

A S FOR the moons of Saturn 
the confusion became such 
that finally names had to be 
called in. The first of them to be 
discovered, by Christiaan Huyg- 
hens in 1655, was Titan, but its 
discoverer simply called it Luna 
Saturni, Saturn’s Moon. But then 
Giovanni Domenico Cassini dis- 
covered four more moons of Sa- 
turn. Collectively he wanted them 
to be known as the Sydera Lodoi- 
cea (the stars of Louis XIV) but 
individually he numbered them, 
in the order of distance from the 
planet. This made Huyghen’s 
moon S-4. The end of discoveries, 
however, was not yet. William 
Herschel discovered two more, 
both closer to Saturn than the 
known ones. How to number 
now? Call them S-6 and S-7, as 
Herschel suggested (with S-7 be- 
ing incongruously the closest to 
the planet) or should everything 
be re-numbered? And if that were 
done, who could guarantee that 
any additional discoveries would 
kindly orbit Saturn at a greater 
distance than those already num- 
bered? It was Sir William Her- 



42 



GALAXY 



schel’s son, Sir John Herschel, 
who suggested to use the names 
of the mythological sisters and 
brothers of Saturn. This is the 
list — Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, 
Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion and 
Japetus — which is now generally 
used. 

In 1898 Professor William H. 
Pickering added another moon 
and another sister of Saturn to 
the list: Phoebe. 

Sir John Herschel also named 
the satellites of Uranus. His fa- 
ther had thought that he had 
discovered six satellites of Uranus. 
Four of them turned out to be 
mistakes, but two were real. Wil- 
liam Lassell, in 1851, added two 
more so that four satellites were 
known. Sir John Herschel’s pro- 
posed names Ariel, Urnbriel, Ti- 
tania, and Oberon were accepted 
largely because Lassell, who had 
discovered two of them, accepted 
the names. (Oberon and Titania 
are, of course, the king and queen 
of the fairies in Shakespeare’s 
Midsummer Night’s Dream; Ariel 
is a spirit in The Tempest while 
Urnbriel is a gnome and Ariel a 
sylph in Pope’s Rape of the 
Lock . ) 

Still, it is interesting that a full 
dozen satellite names originated 
with a man who had not dis- 
covered a single one of them. 
When Gerard P. Kuiper discov- 
ered a fifth satellite of Uranus 
(closer to it than any of the 



others) he called it Miranda to 
stay within the mythology. 

Neptune’s major satellite was 
also discovered by William Las- 
sell (in 1846) and Camille Flam- 
marion suggested “Triton,” Nep- 
tune’s companion, as a name. Like 
Amalthea it is “not official” and 
for the same reason. But it is in 
use now, largely because Kuiper, 
when discovering a second satel- 
lite of Neptune in 1949, named 
it “Nereid” which he, as the dis- 
coverer, had the right to do. 

The two moons of Mars, dis- 
covered by Asaph Hall in 1877, 
are, of course, Phobos and Deimos 
(Fear and Terror,) the attend- 
ants of Mars in the ninth book 
of the Iliad. 

The names of the five naked- 
eye planets are fairly easy. Still, 
it may be useful to mention first 
that the word “planet” comes 
from the Greek planetes (the 
wanderers) because they do not 
stand still in the sky like the 
“fixed” stars. The word “comet”, 
incidentally, comes from the Lat- 
in word coma (“head of hair”) 
and not from the Greek word 
which sounds the same (and 
should be spelled “koma”) and 
which means “deep sleep.” 

Now Mercury, the innermost of 
the planets, is the fastest moving, 
in reality as well as to the naked 
eye. Hence it became, in Greek, 
Hermes (properly Hermeias) the 
swift-moving messenger of the 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



43 



gods. The Latin name Mercurius 
also bears the connotation of swift 
movement but is derived from 
mercis, which means “wares.” 
Hence Mercurius became the god 
of the traders and merchants but 
also the god of the thieves — for 
which latter fact one may harbor 
two different opinions; one is un- 
flattering to merchants, the other 
merely points out that a thief has 
to move even faster than a trader. 
The names for Mercury in the 
eastern languages usually are the 
word for “arrow,” or a name de- 
rived from that word. 

"Y^ENUS, bright and beautiful, 
' became female with all na- 
tions except in India. The Chinese 
called Venus Tai-pe, “the beauti- 
ful white one.” to the Germanic 
tribes the planet was Frigga; to 
the Babylonians Ishtar; to the 
Romans Venus. Venus was origi- 
nally the Spring Goddess and 
only later the goddess of love, 
equivalent to the Greek Aphro- 
dite. Since Venus can appear 
either as morning or as evening 
star, the Greeks originally had two 
names for the planet, Hesperos 
and Phosphoros. Pythagoras of 
Samos is credited with having 
identified them as the same 
planet. 

As unanimously as white Venus 
became a beautiful woman, red 
Mars became a warrior. The Per- 
sians called Mars Pahlavani Siph- 



ir, the Celestial Warrior. To the 
Chaldeans he was Nergal, the god 
of battle, to the Greeks Ares, also 
the god of war, regardless of 
whether the name is derived from 
aro (to kill) or from ara (dis- 
aster.) The Germans also identi- 
fied the planet with their god of 
war, and Roman Mars is, of 
course, the god of war too. 

As for Jupiter it probably was 
given the name of the chief deity 
of the Romans — the name is 
stated to be derived from lovis 
pater — because of its steady 
light, being the brightest of the 
planets except Venus. Of course 
Jupiter is the equivalent of Zeus. 
And it is also quite possible that 
the naming went the other way 
round, that the god was given the 
name of the serenely shining plan- 
et, for when you said in Latin 
sub love it meant “under the open 
sky.” 

Saturn, in Latin Saturnus, was, 
mythologically speaking, the god 
of agriculture and the husband of 
Ops, the goddess of wealth. The 
name is related to the verb serere, 
“to sow”. The Greek equivalent 
was Kronos. Why the name of the 
god of agriculture was bestowed 
upon the planet is something that 
I would have considered a mys- 
tery until about three months ago, 
when I found an interesting ref- 
erence in a very modern book on 
the planet Saturn by the British 
astronomer A. F. O’D. Alexander. 



44 



GALAXY 



He states that the name most 
often used for Saturn by the As- 
syrians was lubadsagush which, 
since lubad meant “old sheep,” 
has to be translated as “the oldest 
of the old sheep,” another agricul- 
tural comparison. Alexander 
thinks that the name was due to 
the fact that Saturn moves so 
slowly among the stars. Possibly 
Saturn’s slow movement accounts 
for its Latin name too, reminding 
the skywatchers of the slow gait 
of ploughing oxen. 

For the remaining three planets 
there is no mystery about their 
names. When William Herschel 
discovered Uranus he first pro- 
posed the name of Georgium Si- 
dus in honor of George III. Out- 
side of Great Britain nobody was 
pleased with this suggestion, 
which revived what Galilei and 
then Cassini had tried to do. 
Joseph Jerome Lalande in Paris 
suggested that the newly discov- 
ered planet should be known as 
Herschel’s Planet, in the same 
manner in which one speaks of 
Halley’s Comet. 

But there was no enthusiasm 
for this innovation. Other astron- 
omers felt that it was enough to 
be able to attach one’s name to 
a comet (or to have a lunar crater 
named after one — posthumously, 
that is) and when Johann Elert 
Bode, the director of the Berlin 
observatory, suggested Uranus 
most astronomers agreed rapidly. 



It was actually the offshoot of the 
Herschel-Lalande-Bode contro- 
versy which produced the severe- 
ly classical names for the first 
asteroids some dozen years later. 
The word Uranus is just the Latin 
version of the Greek Ouranos 
which means heaven or sky. 

^I'HE pattern repeated sixty-five 
years later when Galle in 
Berlin discovered Neptune close 
to the point where Leverrier in 
Paris had said it should be lo- 
cated. Leverrier had calculated its 
existence and position from the 
perturbations of the orbit of 
Uranus. The French scientist 
Francois Arago — who had a 
political in addition to a scientific 
career and was, among other 
things, responsible for the aboli- 
tion of slavery in the French col- 
onies — revived the suggestion to 
name Uranus “Herschel’s Planet” 
so that the new one could become 
“Leverrier’s Planet.” It did not go 
very far, for the French Bureau 
des Longitudes decided that Nep- 
tune was a fine name for a far 
distant greenish planet and Le- 
verrier himself agreed. The name 
Neptunus is that of the Latin god 
of the seas, equivalent to the 
Greek Poseidon, but neither Ro- 
mans nor classical Greeks ever 
had an opportunity to attach it 
to a planet. 

Pluto, discovered by Clyde 
Tombaugh in 1930, was named 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



45 



for what might be called a per- 
sonal reason. Just as Leverrier, 
and also John Couch Adams in 
England, had calculated Nep- 
tune’s existence from irregulari- 
ties in the motions of Uranus, 
Percival Lowell had tried to cal- 
culate the existence and position 
of one more planet from the same 
source. He had called it Planet X 
but after the discovery of a planet 
which is (for about two thirds of 
its orbit) farther from the sun 
than Neptune, it became obvious 
that that name could not be used 
permanently. But the discovery 
had been made at Lowell’s obser- 
vatory, though long after his 
death, and since the name Pluto 
begins with P-L it was chosen. It 
was correct mythologically too, 
for Pluto, the lord of the infernal 
region, was a brother of both Zeus 
(Jupiter) and Poseidon (Nep- 
tune.) 

Before going on to the names 
of stars the names of two sets of 
features must be mentioned. It has 
already been said that an astron- 
omer’s name might be selected 
posthumously for a crater on the 
moon. Two people are responsible 
for this custom: Langrenus of 
Brussels and Riccioli of Bologna. 
Langrenus made the suggestion of 
naming lunar features after fa- 
mous people, especially astrono- 
mers, around 1640. Johannes 
Hevelius of Danzig, five years 
later, opposed it and transferred 



terrestrial geographical names to 
the moon, which is the reason why 
we speak of the Lunar Alps, the 
Lunar Caucasus, etc. But Giovan- 
ni Batista Riccioli, five years after 
Hevelius’s lunar map with terres- 
trial names, accepted Langrenus’s 
suggestion. He even had a kind of 
a system. He named a large crater 
Plato, then attached the names of 
Eudoxus, Aristotle, Thales, Stra- 
bo, etc., to craters not far from 
Plato. Riccioli admired Tycho 
Brahe; therefore the most con- 
spicuous crater was named Tycho. 
Since Copernicus did not agree 
with Tycho Brahe, the lunar 
crater Copernicus is far away 
from the crater Tycho. But since 
Kepler agreed with Copernicus, 
the crater Kepler is near the 
crater Copernicus. 

'^■''HE visible features of the 
planet Mars went through 
a number of linguistic transforma- 
tions. It was only just about a cen- 
tury ago that telescopes became 
powerful enough to show surface 
features on Mars and, logically, 
observers in different countries 
began making drawings of Mars. 
And they started naming things, 
in their own tongues. Thus a map 
of Mars drawn by Richard An- 
thony Proctor in 1867, following 
Riccioli’s practice, is full of names 
of astronomers. There is a Her- 
schel I Continent, a Herschel II 
Strait, Fontana Land. Laplace 



46 



GALAXY 



Land, Tycho Sea and so forth, all 
in English, of course. On a map 
drawn by Camille Flammarion 
some of the names are the same, 
like the Herschel I Continent, but 
others are changed. What Proctor 
had called the Kaiser Sea (after 
the Dutch astronomer Kaiser) ap- 
peared on Flammarion’s map as 
Mer du Sablier. What Proctor 
had called Dawes Continent (af- 
ter the Rev. William Dawes) be- 
came the Continent Beer (after 
the German Beer, the brother of 
the composer Meyerbeer.) What 
Proctor had named Maedler 
Land, after a German astronomer, 
became, on Flammarion’s map 
Terre de Laplace; he named 
something else after Maedler. Of 
course, the whole map was in 
French. 

Well, the third to draw a map 
was Giovanni Virginio Schiapa- 
relli in Italy. What Flammarion 
had called Mer Terhy appeared 
on Schiaparelli’s map as Solis 
Lacus; what had been the Kaiser 
Sea or the Mer du Sablier, re- 
spectively, appeared as Syrtis 
Major. The light area around 
Lacus Solis, Terre de Kepler on 
Flammarion’s map, became Thau- 
masia. The Mer de Fontana be- 
came Elysium and the Mer Oude- 
mann became Trivium Charontis. 
By the grace of God Schiaparelli’s 
system won out in all countries, 
and most of his names are still in 
use. By being Latin they are the 



same in all languages, because 
they are nobody’s language. 

We now come to the names of 
constellations and of some con- 
spicuous stars, but for practical 
reasons the evolution of the cur- 
rent system has to be discussed 
first. 

Hipparch’s star catalogue, as 
preserved for us in the Almagest, 
listed a total of 1022 stars which, 
of course, are all naked-eye stars, 
leaving out a number of faint ones 
and, naturally, neglecting the 
southern hemisphere almost com- 
pletely. (At a later date the 
French astronomer Houzeau 
stated that a man with perfect 
vision, if he first counted from a 
rather northern latitude and then 
continued from a southern lati- 
tude, would reach a total of 5719 
stars.) Now all stars were sorted 
into six classes according to their 
apparent brightness. The bright- 
est ones were in the first class 
(later called the first magnitude) 
and the just visible ones formed 
the sixth class. 

So far there was no special 
problem, but this soon ceased to 
be the case if a specific star was 
to be picked out. The invention 
of the constellations helped. A 
total of forty-eight are listed in 
the Almagest: the twelve signs of 
the zodiac, twenty-one constella- 
tions north of the zodiac and fif- 
teen to the south of the zodiac. 
(The names of almost all of them

are still in use.) A constellation 
was useful for stating which star 
one had in mind, in that it limited 
the area of the sky. In fact, this 
is the main reason why the names 
of constellations are still used, 
and at the Astronomical Congress 
at Leyden (The Netherlands) in 
1928 the limits of the constella- 
tions were carefully established. 
Modern star charts have the 
eighty-eight constellations agreed 
upon during that congress. 

But to go back to the Greek 
astronomers. The star he had in 
mind (Aldebaran) was in the 
constellation Taurus and had to 
be described as “the bright star in 
the southern eye of the bull.” Or 
another star (Rigel) had to be 
designated as “the bright star in 
Orion’s left foot.” 

One wonders why the Greeks 
did not think of the simple device 
of just numbering the stars in a 
constellation after they had once 
been carefully described in the 
elaborate manner just quoted. But 
they didn’t. 

Alessandro Piccolomini, in 
1568, took the first step in that 
direction. He omitted the usually 
rather elaborate m 3 rthological pic- 
tures, also all the faint stars, but 
he gave a map showing the posi- 
tions of the larger stars and 
labeled them with the Latin 
alphabet. A German lawyer who 
was an ardent astronomer, Jo- 
hannes Bayer, did what we do 



now. He labeled the stars in each 
constellation with Greek letters, 
switching to the Latin alphabet 
only when there were more stars 
in a constellation that the Greek 
alphabet has letters. In his book, 
the Uranometria, which appeared 
for the first time in 1603, he said 
that it was his system to call the 
brightest star of each constellation 
alpha, the next brightest beta, the 
third brightest gamma, the fourth 
delta and so on. Of course, he 
made a number of mistakes. His 
alpha is not always the brightest 
star; but that his idea was good is 
proved by the simple fact that we 
still use it. Thus we say that the 
first photographs of Pluto were 
found on a plate centered on 
delta GeminoTum, the fourth 
brightest star in the constellation 
Gemini. Bayer’s system is such a 
space-saving device; Aldebaran 
becomes alpha Tauri, Capella al- 
pha Aurigae, Castor and Pollux 
alpha and beta Geminorum and 
Sirius alpha Cams majoris. (If 
you have the Greek letters and 
enter them in a chart of the con- 
stellation so that its name does 
not need to be repeated there is 
a real time and space saver.)

name came about. Most of them 
we don’t know. 

But I do want to mention that 
in the course of time stars at the 
border of one constellation have 
often been shifted into the neigh- 
boring constellation, sometimes 
deliberately, more often by mis- 
take. Even the famous zodiac did 
not remain unaffected. The 
Greeks had only eleven zodiacal 
signs for several centuries. Libra, 
in that zodiac, had turned into the 
pincers of the neighboring con- 
stellation Scorpio. Tracing the 
shifts of this type is a whole sub- 
branch of the history of astrono- 
my which has the special name 
of Astrognosis. This is the area 
where astronomy and archeology 
(plus “ordinary history”) touch 
and overlap. 

Many of the individual names 
of stars are Arabic but they are 
not always “pure.” In addition to 
truly old Arabic names there are 
many which are pseudo-Arabic, 
being Arabic adaptations of 
names from other languages. And 
later on many of them went 
through another transformation, 
usually Latinization, to make 
them pronounceable for Euro- 
pean tongues. Aldebaran is a case 
in point. The Arabic form ad- 
dabaran was produced by trans- 
lating a Greek sentence. An ex- 
pert on Arabic astronomy. Dr. 
Paul Kunitzsch, a German living 
in Cairo, says that Arab scholars 



themselves are uncertain what 
the word really means but think 
the root word is dbr which means 
“to be behind something” or “to 
follow something.” The meaning, 
astrognostically speaking, would 
then be “the star which follows 
the Hyades.” 

What name could sound more 
“Arabic” than Algol? Well, it is 
Arabic all right, but not originally 
so. The star Algol, beta Persei on 
charts, was the Gorgon’s head. 
This designation, in Arabic, be- 
came ra’s al-gul, the head of the 
Gul, a demon in Arabic mytholo- 
gy. As for Deneb, alpha Cygni, 
the current name is an abbrevia- 
tion. The Arabic original is danab 
ad-dagaga, “tail of the chicken.” 

I have mentioned earlier that 
the star beta Orionis was de- 
scribed by the Greeks as the 
“bright star in Orion’s left foot”. 
The Arabic version was rigl al- 
yusra, “Orion’s foot,” and the star 
is called Rigel to this day — 
though nobody is quite certain 
how it should be pronounced. 

While it is interesting to find 
out why a number of bright stars 
bears the names they do, individ- 
ual star names are slowly coming 
out of use. Which, considering 
everything, is probably a logical 
development. As distinct from the 
names of the constellations, which 
are useful as area designations, 
there is little need for individual 
star names. — WILLY LEY

TT had been John Brest’s custom 
-*■ to hike long distances every 
Sunday as far back as he could re- 
member. This Sunday was like 
any other. 

By stages, Brest had walked all 
the patterned superhighways that 
crisscross the state, enjoying the 
fecal odor of marsh gas and the 
arsenical exhalations of the coke 
plants. At dusk, before the mos- 
quitoes rose, he entered any town 
that offered itself and bussed it 
back to the larger city where he 
made his living. There was no one 
to make anything of his entrances 
and exits,., no one to bother him 
with Where are you going? and 
Why? 

He hovered this Sunday before 
the wings of an intersection intri- 
cate beyond anything encount- 
ered before. There was an un- 
familiar city on the horizon with 
a towering smokestack that 
poured clouds of white smoke in- 
to the humid air — not in a 
steady stream, but in unlikely 
pulses. He knew he had never 
seen it before. After so long, he 
was lost. 

He trudged down the cement 
incline and began to follow, duti- 
fully, the frozen dance-figure of 
the intricate cloverleaf. It was 
growing dark by the time he 
reached the bottommost level, 
with layers of bridges and ramps 




He was innocent — tragically 
innocent — in a place where 
only the guilty were secure! 



ON THE WALL OF THE LODGE

piled above. The disused tunnel 
before which he was standing car- 
ried no traffic; but he had come 
to terms with the meadows for 
the day. He must risk traversing 
this deserted tube, without know- 
ing whether it led him to the un- 
known city or nowhere. 

He was heartened at once by 
an enthusiastically obscene sug- 
gestion crayoned in red on the 
near wall. Someone had been 
there before him, breathing ex- 
haust and methane and hydrogen 
sulfide and thinking of his private 
pleasures. 

In the exhaust-filled air breath- 
ing was becoming difficult, when 
there was a sudden meowing of 
rubber on concrete, right over the 
tunnel’s mouth. Here was his 
chance to get directions. Brest 
ran. 

The car had swerved to a stop 
on the sloping overpass to Brest’s 
right. Its nose pointed directly at 
him. He had the uneasy convic- 
tion that he had faced it before, 
and that it meant to plunge 
through the guard-rails if he made 
a wrong move. 

He backed off, still staring at 
the car, which seemed to stare in 
return. Its high headlamps winked 
on for a moment, blinding him but 
reassuring him. It had never been 
like that. In none of his Sunday 
hikes had he traversed this tunnel 
before, nor had he ever seen this 
low-slung, foreign-looking car that 



menaced him from behind the 
rails of the overpass. 

Never turning his back to it, he 
went sideways along the chute, 
scrambling over two railings 
where they were level with each 
other, until his feet touched the 
higher roadbed. An ominous 
thrumming came from the odd 
car, but there was nobody at the 
wheel. 

Brest went to the near railing. 
He was now high enough out of 
the pit to see a little way over 
the meadows again. The smoke- 
stack pulsed on the horizon. He 
caught a movement, or the after- 
ripple in the air of a movement, 
down among the twists and turns 
he had just scaled. 

“Hey! Hi! Come back!” cried 
Brest. 

The squat figure, only its ro- 
tund torso visible and that decked 
out in some outlandish sporting 
costume, mostly red, stumbled 
when he called; flung out one arm 
as if to wave, or keep its balance; 
leaped behind a pillar and dis- 
appeared. 

Brest ran a little way, peering 
fruitlessly. 

The man couldn’t have been 
going for gas; the car was still 
running. What then? “Clown!” 

He turned back to the strange 
car and circled it warily. It had 
no license plates, nor any mount- 
ing brackets. There were dials on 
the dashboard, but with mounting

irritation he found he could not 
read them. He opened the right- 
hand door where the wheel was 
and slid tentatively onto the cush- 
ion. His elbow touched the horn 
button. The car responded with a 
five-note call so wild that he 
spread-eagled against the plush. 

T>UT nobody came. The car 
continued to throb, quite 
gently, now he was inside it. He 
fiddled with the levers and pedals, 
thinking he just might point the 
car in a safer direction. The mo- 
ment his foot touched the gas, the 
whole car purred like a cheetah, 
and the big meter that said RPM 
ran itself up into the high thou- 
sands. If he was stymied, the car 
was ready. 

Cautiously he shifted it into 
reverse and let the clutch up. It 
backed so smoothly away from 
the railing that he hardly had 
time to turn it to face- the right 
way. 

Or was it the right way? 

For him, perhaps it was. 
Throngs of mosquitoes had risen 
on the flats by now. He could 
simply drive the car to the strange 
city and turn it over to the police, 
since the owner was so obstinately 
missing. 

The suspicion of stealing 
touched him. He hesitated. 

He looked through the car for 
some hint of identity. There was 
nothing but a crumpled pink 



blanket in the back seat. He knelt 
and reached over for it, feeling 
something roll free as he pulled. 

There was an amazing amount 
of the fabric. It filled the floorwell 
right up to seat level by the time 
he had got it all off. The object 
left behind on the seat was a red 
thermos. 

That was hardly a clue. It 
would be a break, though, if the 
thing contained hot coffee . 
but it did not. It contained only 
a sticky, sweet odor, compounded 
of violets, alcohol and something 
that rankly suggested beef blood. 
He tossed it over the rim of the 
window without having meant to, 
and heard it shatter with a grati- 
tude all the more intense for its 
senselessness. 

The overcast sky between the 
loops of the cloverleaf was losing 
its dun rose to the night-city’s sky- 
glare, faintly lurid and anony- 
mously red. The car hummed, 
waiting for him to decide. He 
shrugged convulsively, released 
the brake and stepped on the gas. 

The overpass did not go down, 
after all. The foreign car, thrum- 
ming like a plague of grasshop- 
pers, carried Brest through dips 
and darknesses as breathtaking as 
a rollercoaster and then began to 
climb again. 

He was pleased to see the light 
patterns of traffic. With misgiv- 
ings he realized that it was all 
below him now. He was so high 



ON THE WALL OF THE LODGE 



55 



in the air he grew alarmed. The 
car bored on over the high hump 
and began to descend, its mush- 
room-like radiator cap singing ab- 
stractedly just under his nose. It 
went faster and faster, although 
he let up on the gas pedal at every 
faint relaxation of the endless 
curve. Screaming over onto two 
wheels, the car took the tight bind 
of a ramp and hurtled onto a nar- 
row pitted road. 

Light poles blossomed, for it 
was full dark suddenly, and they 
brought everything into relief like 
toys. The great knot of the inter- 
section, pricked out in yellow, 
dwindled and tightened in the 
rear-view mirror. 

It was beginning to rain. 

Inside the car it was hot, and 
the windshield fogged. He de- 
cided he must wriggle out of his 
shirt to wipe it clear. The car did 
not waver or weave; it seemed 
almost to be driving itself as he 
pulled his cuff-buttons loose and 
freed his back and belt of the 
soggy cloth. The car’s obedience 
to his no-hands control made him 
smile. 

After a while he became aware 
that the smile had fixed itself 
and he sucked his cheeks back in- 
to place. The rain fell harder and 
there really seemed to be nothing 
to smile about. For one thing, he 
was driving without lights. The 
first button lit a tiny rectangle 
which turned out to be a radio; 



there was a cozy, unintelligible 
murmuring in the car from the 
little speaker. 

That was all right, but he was 
frantic for his brights. Finally he 
felt a cold dot at his fingertip, 
pushed it and saw the dimpled 
road come lemon-alive, squirming 
with rain. Safe? No, but a col- 
lision now wouldn’t be his fault. 
He turned up the volume on the 
radio and settled back to listen 
as he drove. 

The voice was his. He froze on 
the wheel and began to sweat 
again. 

i4T WAS making about sixty,” 
his own voice said. “It was 
raining, and I was in a hurry. It 
didn’t seem like much of a speed 
— the car was old, and ■ — ” 

“Much of a speed!” The new 
voice was as pleasant and as cold 
as enamel. A man’s voice, but not 
one he had ever heard before. 
“Sixty’s a fair speed, I’d say. And 
those Daimlers can be cranked up 
to a hundred without much diffi- 
culty.” 

There was a glare of lightning, 
and the radio chuckled and 
strangled the next words. The rain 
hammered the car’s top. When 
Brest could hear again, the glazed 
voice was saying, “. so decrepit 
to me. You could talk as if it had 
been about to fall apart under 
you. How could you be so familiar 
with a stolen car, anyhow?” A 



56 



GALAXY 



studio organ played an ominous 
gliss. 

This was too much. Better to 
walk in the torrent — there 
wouldn’t be any mosquitoes in 
this rain anyhow. He put his foot 
hard on the brake pedal and it 
went all the way to the floor with- 
out any compression. He yanked 
at the handle of the emergency 
brake. It came up so easily he 
knew it was connected to no cable 
any more. 

The radio would not click off. 
He could only turn the volume 
back down to that muted insect 
hum he had found so cheering 
initially. 

He took his foot off the gas. 
The car bored purposefully on 
through the rain. He was afraid to 
let go of the wheel. It would be 
the final admission that the car 
had run away with him. 

Suddenly he said to himself, 
I’m dreaming, and the words were 
so great a tension that he felt his 
head swimming. 

With a gasp, he let go of the 
wheel and put his clammy shirt 
back on. Let the damned car 
drive itself if it liked. It would 
probably plunge him over a cliff 
or something like that at any mo- 
ment and let him back into his 
bed at the rooming house. He 
conceived a cunning plan for 
cheating the dream. He knelt up 
on the seat to crawl over and go 
to sleep in the back; sleep within 



sleep, and the crumpled pink 
blanket to comfort him. Let the 
car go to hell, then, unwatched. 

The car pitched around a cor- 
ner and braked, throwing Brest’s 
head sharply against the wheel, 
and that klaxon began to sound 
its wild call over and over. The 
hard tires screamed, and then 
there was a hollow denting noise 
and the fragmenting of glass. His 
head was so full of pain that he 
did not realize for a while after 
he sat up again that the car had 
stopped. 

Outside, in the whisper of rain, 
there was a sucking sound of foot- 
steps coming toward him. 

“Hey, you.” 

Brest took his ringing head out 
of his hands. 



II 

'■| ■'HE FACE which looked in at 
him through the near win- 
dow was male, young and beauti- 
ful. It regarded him out of black 
eyes as shining and smoky as 
prize marbles. Then there were 
two such faces, both topped by 
black hair combed, neatly, 
straight back. 

“Get out.” 

“Did I hit you?” he said. “Any- 
body hurt? I’m damned sorry if 
I did. It was accidental. This hack 
ran away with me.” 

“Yeah,” one of the young men 



ON THE WALL OF THE LODGE 



57 



said. “Get out of there before we 
come in and beat the living kek 
out of you.” 

“Now wait a minute,” Brest 
said, beginning to tremble. “I’m 
trying to be decent about this. 
I’ve got insurance — ” He realized 
suddenly that he had, in effect, 
stolen the foreign car. “What I 
mean is, there’s no sense in pick- 
ing a fight. I’m willing to pay for 
any damage. I lost control of 
m-my car, and I was lost, anyhow. 
By the way, what city is this?” 
One of the young men took the 
car door by the handle and tore 
it open with a wailing of metal. 
He had actually pulled one hinge 
loose. Brest goggled. When they 
began to slide onto the seat he 
grappled for the other door. The 
young man on the seat reached 
out a deliberate hand and took 
him by the wrist. His fingers were 
supple and hot, but hard. 

“Now?” he said. “He’s just ask- 
ing for it.” 

“No, let him go.” 

“I don’t want to.” 

“Let him go, I said. Can’t you 
see the car isn’t his? He has a long 
run ahead if it isn’t. Or would you 
like a dose of the law yourself?” 
The other voice seemed eager. 
The flat fingers released Brest’s 
wrist. He sat in acute tetany for 
an instant, and then tumbled out 
the other side of the car into the 
mud. Inside the foreign car, the 
two young men argued with each 



other in low, precise voices. One 
of them said, “You’re such a child. 
If you kill them on sight . .” 
Cautiously, sprawling, Brest 
wriggled away. The other voice 
said: “. of chasing. Someday 
you’ll learn love better. A fine day 
that’ll be, too. Full of screams.” 
“Yours, I warn you.” 

“Yes, mine. For joy, you . 
There was silence. Brest got to 
his hands and knees, his belly 
already as wet as if he had been 
sprayed. From that position he 
saw the machine his own car had 
wrecked. It was a slabsided 
sedan at least thirty years old, 
which had simply fallen apart on 
contact. The four wheels stood 
firmly on cobbles, but the frame 
was askew and canted above 
them, and all the high rusty fend- 
ers had fallen off. The car had 
been fit only for a circus stunt in 
the first place; the owner of the 
foreign car could claim far more 
expensive damages than the total 
wreck of this caricature had in- 
volved. But the continuing argu- 
ment did not move him to stay 
around and press claims. 

He crawled quietly to the 
wooden pavement. It was getting 
brighter still. He got around the 
corner of a windowless concrete 
building without incident, and 
had just noticed that here the 
street was in much better con- 
dition, when there was a cata- 
mount scream behind him. 



58 



GALAXY 



T^ESPITE himself, he stopped 
listen, but nothing came 
through except a sort of yowling. 
Then one of the voices said, very 
high and clear: “Now you’ll be- 
have.” 

There was another moan. 
“Yes, you will. You’re in a 
minority, sweetheart, that I prom- 
ise you; you’ll learn. You can’t 
take one of them where you find 
them. You have to whip up a 
chase, and have the stupes chas- 
ing with you. Even then you have 
to show innocence, if you can. 
But the stupes will always chase 
with you, and when you catch 
one, then he’s yours. If you take 
them where you find them — ” 
“Rrr,” the other voice said, al- 
most inaudible. “I’ll find yours, 
damn you, I swear I will.” 

“But that’s for jail, believe me,” 
the first voice said. “We’ll have 
no one but each other when the 
last pinch comes. Don’t think it 
won’t be fun, darling; I have plans 
for you. Right now we’ve got 
every jam that keeps on the white 
line. It won’t last, but it’s worth 
prolonging. Don’t you know a 
good thing when you’ve got it? 
Hell, of course you don’t. What a 
sweetheart! You should live 
where they make the laws. But 
this one won’t last; it’s a shorty. 
You’ve got to chase for it, or the 
stupes will catch on. That’ll be a 
hassel, believe me.” 

There was a feeble sound of 



applause. Brest listened, wonder- 
ing. 

“All right,” said the young man 
who had screamed. “Where’d he 
get to, anyhow? You and your 
plays to the gallery!” 

“Around the corner flapping his 
ears, or I miss my guess. He’s a 
sturdy boy. Let’s go.” 

Sweating ice, Brest ran. 

Despite the uncertainty of his 
knees, he ran with fair confidence. 
His walking had settled him a 
little, but it had kept up his wind 
and his patience. Besides, he knew 
that he was in a hurry and did 
not put more energy into bounc- 
ing up and down than into going 
forward. He ran on his toes and 
for stride. 

But when he looked over his 
shoulder, he saw the young men 
— there were four of them now, 
three of them absolutely alike, 
the fourth chubby and comical — 
flying down the broad, deserted 
street with huge zigzag bounds 
that covered at least ten feet each. 
Brest had once seen a deer or 
some such animal run like that, 
but never a human being. He esti- 
mated that he was making about 
a nine-foot stride and the ad- 
vantage the young men had was 
partly lost through the eccentric- 
ity of their leaps. His stride-rate 
was a fraction faster than theirs. 
He looked back again. 

The chubby young man took 
the lead, striking cement and

sailing with an effortlessness that 
was not grace, but something to 
which grace was irrelevant, like 
the skipping of a flat stone on 
water. Ahead, the street gleamed 
with the merciless clarity of 
early dawn. Several of the flat- 
faced white buildings had thin 
gutters of sunlight along their par- 
apets. Brest found himself won- 
dering why the sun should be 
rising on the right, not the left. 
He realized that he had no idea 
which way was East anyhow. 
Also, it was too soon; the ride in 
the runaway car had lasted for- 
ever, but not all night. 

No people on the street, no 
fronts to the shops — if they were 
shops — no cross-streets or alley- 
ways. Could it be that the road- 
way itself, despite its broadness, 
was really an alley and that the 
buildings had their backs to him? 
Still, most buildings have back en- 
trances. These had none. One 
white concrete fagade had a small 
window in it, two or three stories 
up. As he drew abreast of it, he 
opened his mouth to shout, though 
he had no idea what he would 
say — “Help!”, perhaps — for 
the window had a figure in it, a 
woman leaning on her palms 
looking blindly out into the sun. 

Before he could make a sound, 
however, the woman’s right- hand 
dropped away from her chin and 
dipped below the level of the sill. 
It came up again with some small 



object, which it hurled with blur- 
ring speed squarely at Brest’s 
head. He ducked, and it missed 
him, but he heard it singing as it 
went by. He was sure that it 
would have brained him, and had 
been intended for nothing else. 

THE WOMAN, a young 
- woman in a dun-colored, no- 
style robe, had never looked at 
him. It had been as if the hand 
had sought and flung its missile 
automatically — as if, and this 
to a man unused to being stoned 
by young women was possible, it 
were the law in this city that a 
running man must be stoned. 

But a message, now? He 
twisted to look back, but the ob- 
ject had been a stone and nothing 
else. At the same time Brest saw 
that his pursuers had halved the 
interval. Now he could see their 
expressions: they were all smiling, 
quietly, the kind of smile that 
young noblemen wear in noble 
old oil-paintings, and they did 
not seem to be breathing. Brest’s 
own lungs were twin sacs of acid. 
He faced front desperately. 

The street began to curve grad- 
ually. As he went around the 
broad sweep, the buildings were 
discontinued without notice. He 
saw, across an impressive and 
treeless public square, the chim- 
ney of the power plant. It was so 
close at hand that he was afraid 
to look up; he would surely have 



60 



GALAXY 



fallen down. He turned toward it 
and ran harder. It seemed hardly 
likely that there was any safety 
in the place, but it was at least 
familiar, he had seen it before. 
His guess that it was a power 
plant gave it a meaning where all 
other meaning was lacking. 

It was hard to tell how close 
he was, because he had no idea 
of how high the chimney actually 
was. For all he knew, it was big 
enough to be like a mountain, 
which looks changelessly near for 
a long time before it is ready to 
fall upon the traveler. No, it was 
not so distant; he could see the 
bricks in its base. 

Immediately behind his back, 
he could head the light impacts of 
his hunters’ feet as they bounded 
in his spoor. While he listened, 
the sound changed to an even 
lighter trotting, and one by one all 
four of the young men pulled up 
alongside him, moving easily, 
matching his own steps. They did 
not speak to him, nor attempt to 
seize him. 

All five sped abreast. With dif- 
ficulty, because he had already 
resigned himself to running for- 
ever, he slowed down, scuffing 
his soles against the flags, and 
stopped. In the silence his lungs 
whooped raucously, raling for 
rest and air. The four young men 
scattered and came back, posting 
themselves at the compass-points, 
and looked at him. They were all 



smiling beneficently still, but their 
eyes were smoke. 

Brest waited until he was 
breathing at a reasonable rate, 
realizing that he could do noth- 
ing about his heart. Then he said, 
“I don’t know what your game 
is. You won’t tell me. But the 
first one of you that takes a step 
my way — ” 

He stopped; he had no reserves 
left. But at once a fresh wave of 
terror passed through his guts, 
and left him something he could 
use. It was black, bare and cruel: 
a knowledge of teeth and finger- 
nails, and of the vulnerability of 
these men’s pretty faces. The 
epiphany made him smile, and the 
feeling of his mouth-muscles 
drawing out his lips was pleasant- 
ly nauseating. 

The four young men seemed to 
see it. They stopped smiling their 
own smiles and moved, each one 
taking one step backward. They 
said nothing. Brest kept his head 
swiveling gently, in order to see 
all of them. The chimney towered. 
He said: “What do you want?” 
The buildings bounding the 
square echoed every word sol- 
emnly. 

There was no answer. They 
watched him. They had the ad- 
vantage, as they surely knew. An 
attack of his own was being 
forced upon him — but he had 
done nothing to provoke their 
enmity, except for the collision. 



ON THE WALL OF THE LODGE 



61 



which had not been his fault. That 
semblance of guiltlessness was 
worth defending. 

“Are you going to stand there 
forever?” he said hoarsely. “If you 
want something, open up and say 
so. I’ve done no harm!” 

One of the slender young men 
smiled again and Brest jerked 
toward him, every cell quivering 
with alertness. During the same 
motion the young man at the next 
compass-point stepped and drop- 
kicked, with superb control, 
directly into Brest’s groin. The 
public square exploded, he fell, 
fighting only to scream, and eight 
knees pinned him neatly to the 
flagstones. 

Ill 

^ I ■'HE four young men stood on 
the left side of the room, 
with the chubby one at the end 
of the line, and Brest stood on 
the right, the sweat stinging his 
eyes and his kidneys burning. At 
the big scarred desk between 
them there was a man who looked 
with tired hatred on all of them 
and wiped a bald head. 

After a while he said, in a dry, 
almost soundless voice like finger- 
taps on cork; “The claim.” 

“Theft, sir,” one of the young 
men said. 

“What of?” 

“A car, sir,” the young man said 
silkily. The judge turned to look 



at Brest again with bored, dis- 
interested eyes. 

“Did you steal a car?” 

“No,” Brest said, with a force- 
fulness he could hardly have an- 
ticipated even had he not felt 
sick and full of pain. 

“No, what?” 

“No, I didn’t steal a car,” Brest 
said, his indignation growing with 
every breath. “If you want me to 
say ‘sir’ to you, you’ll have to tell 
me why. I don’t know who you 
are, or where I am, or by what 
right these nances drag me in here. 
I’m a citizen and I’m — ” 

There had been a stir among 
the young men; the judge stared 
at them and then back at Brest. 

“Be quiet,” he said. “You have 
no rights here; you’re reported to 
me as a thief. You say you didn’t 
steal the car.” 

“No, I didn’t.” 

“Is the car your car?” 

“No,” Brest admitted readily 
enough. “The people who own it 
abandoned it, and I couldn’t find 
them. I thought I’d drive it to 
the nearest city and turn it over 
to the police.” 

“At way over the limit,” the 
chubby man said pleasantly. “He 
hit our car and knocked it to bits.” 
“I’ll ask you to testify when I 
need you,” the judge said, without 
turning. “Were you, in fact, 
speeding, Mr. — ” 

“Brest,” Brest said. “John Brest. 
I was making about sixty. It was 



62 



GALAXY 



raining and I was in a hurry. It 
didn’t seem like much of a speed 
— the car was old, and — ” 

“Much of a speed!” the chubby 
man said. “Sixty’s a fair speed, 
I’d say. And those Daimlers can 
be cranked up to a hundred with- 
out much difficulty.” 

The judge looked at Brest, as 
if waiting. “I wasn’t making any- 
thing like a hundred,” he re- 
sponded stiffly. “The car couldn’t 
have taken it.” 

The judge opened his dry 
mouth, but Brest never heard 
what came from between the 
shrunken colorless lips. In the 
bright morning light there was a 
long burst of thunder, with a 
sharp edge to it, more like an 
artillery bombardment than a 
storm. As the sound finally died, 
Brest heard the chubby man’s 
enameled voice: 

“ — so decrepit to me. You talk 
as if it had been about to fall 
apart under you. How could you 
be so familiar with a stolen car, 
anyhow?” 

Somewhere an electric organ 
played an ominous gliss. The 
judge cried out like a demented 
hen; “CUT! CUT! CUT! CUT!” 

chubby man stepped out 
of line and struck an attitude 
and waved his nancy fingers, “Oh, 
you’re a thin figure of a thief!” 
There was a confused hubbub 
among the four young men, and 



the judge rose to his feet, his 
mouth making a vicious square 
for a moment. Brest could not 
hear what the judge was saying. 
He could not hear what anyone 
was saying. The sense of having 
lived through these moments be- 
fore had gripped him in a new 
paralysis, worse than his first 
sight of the foreign car. 

His hearing returned. 

The judge was saying: “Take 
it from ‘ . anything to say, Mr. 
Brest?’ ” 

Brest started and swallowed. 
“I didn’t steal the car,” he said. 
“I can see that nobody here is 
going to believe a word I say. I 
was taking the car to the police, 
so its owners could be located. I 
got lost. The car was hard to 
control, and I hit somebody be- 
fore I even saw them . That’s 
all.” 

The judge sighed, and at the 
sound, the four young men leaned 
forward slightly. “Ignorance of the 
law . .” the judge said, looking up 
at the ceiling. “Do you press the 
claim?” 

“Certainly,” snapped one of the 
slim young men. “He’s as guilty 
an innocent as I’ve ever de- 
fended.” 

“Perhaps so. This time, never- 
theless, I’m not going to free the 
man.” 

“I object,” the chubby young 
man said coldly. “For the record.” 

“When was anything ever said 



ON THE WALL OF THE LODGE 



63 



off the record? Take Mr. Brest 
to the Policy Chambers. Maybe 
they’ll give him over to you there. 
It’s a foregone conclusion, I sup- 
pose; but I won’t. Clear out.” 
Brest said, astonished, “Is this 
what you call a fair trial?” 

“Trial?” the judge said. “Who 
said you were on trial? You’re fair 
game here, Mr. Brest; you’re 
lucky that you broke a law at all, 
or you’d have been condemned 
quite a while back. Your runaway 
car saved you, for a while, any- 
how. These gentlemen here have 
made a good case for you. 
They’ve shown, insofar as it can 
be shown, that you have a real 
status as a criminal — though 
actually they meant to show 
nothing more than that you’re 
suspect, which is something else 
again. That status, thanks to my 
ruling, will keep you unharmed 
much longer than mere inno- 
cence. If Policy takes any interest 
in you, you may even be jailed. 
You’ll learn to pray for that, I 
promise you.” 

“I’d rather go home,” Brest 
said. 

The judge smiled as if he were 
about to throw up and said, “Will 
you get out?” 

“We’ll see,” the chubby man 
said. “We’ll see. Come along, you.” 
It took Brest a moment to un- 
derstand that the order was 
meant for him. The four young 
men took him gently, tenderly, by 



the elbows and shoulders. The 
judge continued to stare at the 
far high corner of the room, as if 
he had been turned to marble in 
the white sunlight some time 
back. 

IV 

place where the young 
men marched him was so ob- 
viously a broadcasting station 
that there was no connecting it 
with any governmental function. 
Past every open door were banks 
of tubes and control boards, or 
little knots of actors raving silent- 
ly under glass. There had also 
been a theater, with fans of light 
from baby spots, all amber, and 
people screaming, screaming; dur- 
ing the next leg of his journey his 
head had whooped with that 
sound. The sign on the stage had 
said: 



LAUGHTER 



The young men did not speak 
to him, but they did not forbid 
him his hasty glances into the 
studios and equipment-nests. He 
stopped a moment where 
there was a multitude of beauti- 
ful women, all expensively 
clothed with high fashion figures 
beneath the drapes, and the faces 
of bisque china dolls. Their glass 



64 



GALAXY 



eyes met his without recognition 
that they were alive, even that he 
was alive. 

“Baloney,” said Brest. 

Two of the young men hit him 
simultaneously, one fist per ear. 
He stumbled and the other two 
yanked him erect. He was willing 
to regret the comment, but he 
still did not feel intimidated; he 
would say what he damn pleased, 
and once he saw someone in au- 
thority they’d hear him talk, 
plenty. 

They arrived at lavishly fur- 
nished rooms studded with tele- 
vision screens. Here the air was 
especially mild and grateful to 
Brest’s grime-ground skin. The 
women were more expensive, 
lovely and repellent than ever, 
the couches and carpets deeper, 
the modulations of polite talk 
around him gentler and emptier. 
And the fright more intense. 

No one really looked at the 
screens. The little human figures 
went through motions like some 
subdued form of dancing, or as if 
some one had just set the clock- 
work going again after a long 
stasis. 

The four young men slowed in 
indecision, and muttered among 
themselves. Their voices rose al- 
most to the point where Brest 
could hear what they were saying. 
They thrust him at once into a 
blue velvet armchair and turned 
their backs. Shivering, he looked 



with cynical hopelessness for an 
out. 

He saw, several, all marked 
EXIT in illuminated smoky red. 
The four young men turned and 
looked at him. 

Then they turned away again. 

It took nothing more to con- 
vince Brest that he was not going 
to run, that running was the last 
thing he wanted to do. So they 
wanted him to run, did they? All 
right then, hell would freeze over 
before he’d take a step. 

One of the expensive women 
came up quietly from behind the 
chair and sat down upon its arm. 
When Brest looked up, she bent, 
smiling, and touched his shirt 
pocket, with two fingertips which 
burned like dry ice. He wanted to 
throw the hand off, but he was 
afraid to touch it. He tried to 
shrink into the farthest corner of 
the cushions. 

The woman smiled again and 
took her hand away to adjust her 
skirt. When he made no further I 
move, she arose and went away, 
walking with the profound grace 
of murder for its own sake, like 
a half-grown leopard. 

Brest cradled his frozen ribs 
in both hands and watched her go. 
Nothing in his experience could 
match that stab of demanding 
coldness. 

The young men went on argu- 
ing. Brest’s frozen breast warmed 
gradually and painfully, and after 



ON THE WALL OF THE LODGE 



65 



a while he noticed that there was 
a thin rill of cold moving over his 
chest, as if the damaged breast 
were secreting a milk, or bleeding. 
He touched his shirt tentatively. 
It was damp, but he was afraid 
to explore further — any notice- 
able movement would surely be 
rewarded. 

T>UT nothing happened. The 
young men’s argument went 
on and on like the life stories of 
drunks. Cupping his frost-bitten 
heart with newly automatic 
caution, Brest put his head back 
against the velvet and gave the 
nearest screen his attention. 

A psychologist was interview- 
ing a child novelist. The child 
looked as though it had been cos- 
tumed for a Dickens film, and 
the psychologist was as bearded 
as the experts who testify for 
mouthwash ads. 

They were exploring the situa- 
tion which might have led to the 
writing of the novel. Something 
called a “lodge” played a big part 
in the story, and it seemed that 
the child, in order to help himself 
visualize the place, had built with 
his own hands a full-sized replica 
of the “lodge.” It seemed an un- 
likely proposition, for the child 
did not look to be more than nine 
years old. 

The screen was showing, now, 
what the model lodge looked 
like. It was a low, disorderly 



structure, set in a patently fake 
forest. 

“And the High Hunter?” the 
psychologist’s voice was saying, 
while the camera prowled about 
the lodge, exposing wings set on 
at random, and the crude-hewn 
ends of logs. “I would suggest that 
your father-image may have re- 
ligious significance as well; do you 
agree?” 

“I think it does,” the child’s 
voice said. “I saw the High Hun- 
ter as a — a spirit that kept an 
eye on everything that happened, 
and was sometimes cruel without 
wanting to be or not wanting to. 
An opposite for the Clown, who 
is cruel just to be cruel.” 

While they spoke, two figures 
walked across the screen; one a 
gigantic stony man bound in 
leaves; the other a squat, red- 
nosed creature, dressed in red, 
who reminded Brest simultane- 
ously of — was it St. Nick and 
W. C. Fields? Of the two, he 
rather preferred the Clown — 
whom he knew he had seen some- 
where before. 

The apocryphal stalkers faded 
and the child and the psychologist 
faced each other again. 

“Ah, the Clown. You will ex- 
cuse me — ” a fatherly smile — 
“if I say that the Clown seems out 
of true with the rest of the book. 
Cruel to be cruel, you say. A 
symbol of evil, then?” 

The child stirred and showed 



66 



GALAXY 



its first sign of discomfiture. “No, 
sir, that’s not what I meant. It’s 
— well, the High Hunter isn’t 
human. The Clown is.” 

“He is? Even with his magics 
and all the rest?” 

“Don’t forget he’s the only hu- 
man in the book, so naturally 
he has magics. I don’t think — 
well, look. The High Hunter is 
cruel because he has to be — ” 
“Out of principle?” 

“Yes, sir. That’s right. And the 
Clown is only cruel because he en- 
joys it. You know that about the 
Clown; you expect it. You under- 
stand that that’s the way he is, 
and he’s not a bad fellow in most 
other ways. But with the High 
Hunter, you never know. He’s 
cruel out of principle, that’s just 
it — ” 

ri^HE child was obviously warm- 
ing up to his subject. “For one 
thing,” he said, “he has thousands 
of wards, and he has to take care 
of them all, all the time. One of 
the Hunted — the Mouse, say — 
may have to be killed by the Owl 
so that the Trout can escape the 
Otter. How would the Mouse 
know that? And would he like it 
any better if he did know it? He’s 
more important to himself than 
the Trout. You can’t ever know 
the kind of good the High Hunter 
is after. And so he’s the only one 
who can be satisfied with it. The 
Hunted who have been good will 



have their skins nailed on the 
walls of the Lodge. The Hunted 
who haven’t been good will have 
their skins nailed on the walls of 
the Lodge. There is a difference, 
but how can the Hunted see it?” 
“But what about the Clown?” 
“Well, the Clown is cruel for 
pleasure. He would like all the 
Hunted to survive the Hunt, so 
they can be hunted again. He 
magics and does favors and tries 
to be a good fellow because he 
himself isn’t ever hunted, which 
makes him look like he must be 
a Hunter. The Clown does hunt, 
of course, but he hunts only a 
certain kind of pain. He doesn’t 
kill, and he doesn’t create, either. 
In that way, he’s human. But the 
High Hunter — ” 

And a lot more. Brest cupped 
his aching heart, and began to be 
aware how tired he was, and 
hungry. And guilty; away out on 
the edges of his failing conscious- 
ness, he felt that he should be do- 
ing something before something 
happened for which he would be 
blamed. He was almost asleep 
when a sharp finger made a gliss- 
ando over his collapsed ribcage. 
“Hey, sissy!” 

The four young men, unsmiling, 
stood over him, waiting tensely 
for his response to be delayed 
further, perhaps long enough to 
herd him with a blow. 

“Get up, sweetheart.” 

Brest got up, dizzily. The sound 



68 



GALAXY 



of the young men’s voices filled 
him with sick fury. He said, “In 
your eye, Junior.” 

The fight was short, but he 
loved every second of it. He felt 
each blow as a compliment and a 
vindication, and he fouled with 
aseptic joy. All four of them 
tumbled with him in a stunning 
hailstorm of knuckles and shoes 
on the yielding, bristly carpet. 
Brest caught one throat against 
the heel of his hand, and when 
the rest hauled him battered and 
twitching away, he saw the body 
remain, with darkening arterial 
foam soaking into the nap, silent, 
motionless and beautiful. 

While his muscles shivered and 
his stomach buckled inside his 
belly, the opposite walls of his 
skull rang with killing. That clap- 
per could not be tied. Brest had 
killed; he had given an account 
of himself. 

It seemed undignified that his 
own aching body should be drag- 
ging its feet. 

V 

^1 'HE young men released his 
arms with abrupt unanimity 
and he staggered, bringing up 
against the Lodge itself, startling- 
ly erected in the center of the 
square before the chimney. No 
trees; just as he had thought, the 
background had been faked. Or 
this Lodge was a copy. Either 



way, it was useless to question — 
but could he somehow flail his 
way into the rheumless glance of 
the camera and scream to the 
unknown audience for help? 

A kind of cloud where his 
memory had been kept him from 
it, not any fear of the young men: 
this huge solid station had never 
broadcast so much as a racetrack 
bulletin in the world where he 
had lived up to now. There was 
no way of knowing if the broad- 
casts had an audience at all, 
really. 

The Lodge door opened, as a 
bank of lights flared amber at 
the base of the tower. It was 
toward the lights his pursuers and 
captors were staring. Brest stag- 
gered forward and through the 
opening. The door closed silently 
behind him. 

There was a giant fireplace — 
impossible to believe the ring- 
letted child had lifted or laid that 
fieldstone! — and piled helter- 
skelter a miscellany of items 
easily ascribed to a nine-year- 
old’s collecting instinct. Bags, 
boxes, a tandem bicycle, broken 
toys and carpenter’s tools, and 
food. Brest palmed a nibbled cin- 
namon bun and dispatched it in 
two bites. There was a sink, too, 
its faucet dripping steadily on an 
open and remarkably complete 
chemistry set. Brest put out a 
trembling hand to extract a small 
beaker from the soggy box. He 



ON THE WALL OF THE LODGE 



69 



filled it with water and sipped it 
thirstily, so fast that a dribble ran 
down his chin and wetted his 
front. 

There was a polite knock. 
“Hey, sissy!” 

Brest snatched up the nearest 
item in the rubble — an open, 
three-quarters full sack of flour. 
Enough had spilled so that there 
was slack at the neck of the bag 
and he could swing it like a black- 
jack. He put one hand on the 
doorknob and faltered, “What? 
What do you want?” 

“If you’re quite done, doll, Hos- 
min’s ready. Let’s get it rolling, 
shall we?” The speaker shoved 
the door open and reached in, his 
foot braced on the doorsill as if 
he dared not cross it. He caught 
Brest by the shoulder and yanked 
him into the square again. 

There was a desk now between 
him and the huge smokestack, 
but it seemed to Brest that the 
sets were becoming more and 
more makeshift. No walls, no 
bookshelves, not even a clothes- 
tree; just a desk, and a mqn sitting 
behind it. The three young men 
shoved Brest to within respectful 
distance, and stood back. 

Even close to, the man named 
Hosmin was small. His hair was 
gray, with a richly silver grayness, 
obviously a premature defection 
of heredity; and his face, too, sug- 
gested youth of a kind. It was 
narrow, womanishly delicate, with 



straight lips, high cheekbones and 
a nose as straight as that of a 
Pharaoh. It had, however, no ex- 
pression. The eyes — wonderful 
dark eyes, except for this — stared 
as if sightless; nor did they blink, 
ever. The hands upon the desk 
were off-white as linen, and 'bore 
uselessly long, thin fingers which 
danced constantly on the glass. 

“This is John Brest,” said the 
voice of the chubby young man. 
“Judge Trafling remanded him to 
Policy, Mr. Hosmin.” 

“How do you do,” Hosmin said. 
His voice was soft, almost blurry, 
as if he were trying not to think 
about something else. The mask- 
like stare did not shift. Making an 
aborted gesture with the flour 
sack which still hung from his 
clenched hand, Brest said. “How 
do you do,” although he had 
meant to say something explosive 
and self-righteous. 

“I’m surprised to see you. Have 
you committed a crime?” 

¥>REST remembered Traf ling’s 
warning that his offenses, ac- 
cidental, imaginary or deliberate, 
might be his only protection. 
Even so, he could not admit to 
having ‘committed’ anything. The 
verb implied retribution. He said, 
“Everybody seems to think so. 
But I don’t even know where I 
am. 

“You’re trembling. Sit down.” 
Hosmin warped his gaze beyond 



70 



GALAXY 



the chubby one. “Is this only a 
request for a ruling? You are not 
expected to bring the game here. 
You’ve mistreated him?” 

“No and yes. He wrecked our 
car and resisted arrest. We had 
to manhandle him a little. Later 
he attacked us and we think he’s 
killed one of us. Naturally we had 
to act accordingly.” 

“Naturally,” Hosmin said. He 
lit a cigarette and pulled its coal 
down nearly to his lips in a single 
concentrated drag that made 

V 

Brest’s own lungs ache. As Hos- 
min laid it in a brimming and 
smoldering ashtray, Brest now 
saw that the man was dusty with 
flocculent gray powder which 
made even his skin look granular. 
“But,” said Hosmin, “you have 
not answered me.” 

There was a brief silence. Fi- 
nally the young man said, “No.” 
Hosmin swiveled so that his 
attention was focused near Brest. 
“We have been unwilling to listen 
very closely to your story, Mr. 
Brest. I can see that you are dis- 
turbed. We have a difficult situa- 
tion here, kept only delicately in 
balance, and our methods are ar- 
bitrary most of the time because 
we have no choice. Now tell me 
all about it.” 

The blurry, eminently reason- 
able voice commanded him abso- 
lutely. Numbly, Brest told every- 
thing, extruding the scalding 
words one and two at a time. Be- 



hind him, the three young men 
sat on a curb, bunched, their 
backs turned, transferring a word 
syllable by syllable in muffled 
voices that only Brest could hear: 

Tat. Tie. Tale . .Tat. Tie. Tale. 

“I think I did kill the tall one,” 
Brest added. “I was trying to, 
anyhow. I don’t know what kind 
of operation you’ve got here — 
I can see that you make your own 
laws — but by my lights I was 
treated unjustly for something 
that wasn’t my fault. That makes 
us even. All I want to do is go 
home. If I’m in your way here, 
all you have to do is show me how 
to get out of it.” 

“Well, Mr. Brest,” Hosmin 
said, “you are not in our way, as 
you put it. And as a matter of 
fact you are not our first visitor. 
These violent people arrive, now 
and then it cannot be helped, 
they bring with them their own 
kinds of self-righteousness. Pri- 
vately, Mr. Brest, privately I 
commend your killing. I had not 
thought it possible; I am inter- 
ested that it is, but the wages 
of sin — with luck; do you under- 
stand me? — are written down in 
double columns here, too. To re- 
lease you is unthinkable, there is 
no precedent for that.” 

"DREST had had no hope to 
^ lose, but he said stubbornly, 
“Why?” 

“Because you would suffer in- 



ONTHE WALL OF THE LODGE

credibly,” Hosmin said. “Judge 
Trailing remanded you because 
you have status. Were I to turn 
you loose, or were you to attempt 
to escape, that status would then 
vanish, and you would become 
the object of what we call a chase 
sequence, a live doll to be filmed 
and dubbed later into some pro- 
gram which we may or may not 
broadcast. It would never end. We 
never stop chases, it is not eco- 
nomical. The subjects are chosen 
by lot when they reach technical 
obsolescence in the kind of oper- 
ation we conduct here. To sen- 
tence a human being to a chase 
would be unthinkable.” 

“I don’t understand what the 
hell you’re talking about,” Brest 
said. “Look. You seem to be the 
big boss here. Is that right?” 
“Well,” said Hosmin, “no. Or 
do you mean within this area? 
Of course, my orders are final 
within this operation, which is, 
indeed, quite extensive. But this 
is only a communications enter- 
prise, and does not make overall 
policy. That comes down from, 
ah, upstairs. We transmit in ac- 
cordance with the decisions of 
others, which establish before- 
hand what should and should not 
be transmitted. About that I have 
no say whatsoever.” 

“That’s not what I mean. You 
run this part of it. Why can’t you 
just order me back to where I 
came from? I live in — ” 



“I know where you live,” Hos- 
min said. “You do not. You know 
nothing but a name. Would you 
be able to tell me how you would 
find where you lived if you were 
freed — and freed also of the 
penalties we have for freedom — 
at this moment?” 

“Naturally I can’t answer that. 
Are you pretending that you 
can’t?” 

“No, Hosmin said. “We have 
card files, of course, on that kind 
of information. My point is that 
the information concerns fictions. 
You cannot go back. You are now 
years away from your set, in any 
event. Every second takes you 
farther, every step many years 
farther away. I can do nothing for 
you now but order that you die. 
In your case it will be a little 
premature and nothing more. To 
preserve your life from this point 
on would be an impossible cruel- 
ty.” 

Brest hunched down into the 
chair. He had given up under- 
standing long ago. He said, with 
a bitter stubbornness, “I want to 
live. I want to go home.” 

“You cannot,” Hosmin said in 
a low colorless voice. “You have 
left your home. It was an illusion, 
which, somehow, you saw 
through; we cannot now return 
you to it. It is impossible. Not 
illegal, or unsuitable, or immoral: 
physically impossible. As for liv- 
ing, I could not be so unjust. I 



72 



GALAXY 



must proceed as inevitably I pro- 
ceed, without consent or indeed 
any request for your consent.” 

A faint buzzing interrupted 
Hosmin. The mask remained as 
if by necessity rigid and unsur- 
prised. Only Brest was startled 
when Hosmin said, “Hosmin 
here.” 

The air quivered. There was no 
other voice; only a sort of itchy 
electricity. 

When it stopped, Hosmin said, 
“I am often wrong. It appears that 
you will live. Don’t sit forward, 
Mr. Brest. I have tried to tell you 
that the life you have requested 
is an eternity in boiling oil. Now 
that I have been told, in effect, 
who you are — my dear and only 
friend — ” 

“I don’t — ” 

OREST stopped. The suddenly 
beautiful voice had spoken 
that phrase with so sudden a 
warmth and unmistakable bot- 
tomless shallow cardiac-respira- 
tory shuddering happiness that 
Brest’s own diaphragm leaped 
and stopped. The masked eyes 
made coals; what was it, what was 
happening? He saw the trembling 
fingers snub the cigarette, and was 
unable to move or feel. What? He 
felt intolerably lonely. He had 
been condemned, and yet was 
suddenly the object of some inti- 
mate and umistakable king-mak- 
ing which made him tremble. 



“Yes?” 

ff 

“Wait. I was speaking. I repeal 
nothing. But escape is, after all, 
possible. I ask you to request 
death.” 

“Instead?” 

Hosmin sat, motionless except 
for the slight never-ending tele- 
graphy of his hands, while behind 
him on a sudden monitor colored 
shadows went through their sub- 
dued ritual. The entire set was 
silent. Brest, convinced that the 
world had been cut adrift upon 
his question, was too frozen even 
to tremble. But then there was 
unmistakably boots-and-over- 
shoes music, a long-drawn sigh of 
many distant people and the slid- 
ing of many hurried feet. Slurred 
steps came up behind Brest and 
died ostentatiously, as if waiting 
to be buried. Hosmin raised the 
burden of his hooded eyes to 
Brest’s. 

“Sir,” someone behind Brest 
urgently said. “There’s something 
wrong; a scramble in the tapes, 
or bad editing: something’s being 
dubbed in under the board.” 

Hosmin turned in his chair, 
which turned with him, and the 
thing squealed with a long and 
unbearable ■ torture. The whole 
hollow square squealed back, un- 
alive and protesting. Hosmin was 
looking at the screen, and Brest 
tried to look too. 

It was the chimney, and it was 



ONTHE WALL OF THE LODGE 



73 



pulsing too fast. It looked as 
though it were demented. 

“We’re trying to kill it,” that 
breathless voice said. 

Hosmin snapped, “You can’t 
kill it, from here or anywhere 
else. Send down for a new script.” 

The pressure of someone-be- 
hind-Brest let up without an 
identifiable sound, and the remote 
camera which was scanning the 
chimney soared until the public 
square had become included; the 
chimney, steaming away into a 
corner of the screen, was now in 
the foreground and not the center 
of interest. It could be seen that 
it was built of yellow bricks and 
had staples driven into it. A man 
came running — 

A CROSS the empty square the 
man came running. 

He ran too fast. There was a 
river of black figures pouring out 
after him. Far behind Brest there 
was a composite sigh; “A chase!” 
The blurred man darted across 
the square, his legs twinkling, 
while the black river divided into 
wavefronts and made to surround 
him. The man twisted, darted, 
dodged into the inevitable cul-de- 
sac, and the crowd surged in after 
him. 

“Sound!” Hosmin cried. 

Immediately it came through, 
high and shrill and terrifying. 
Brest, like a bubble, having fought 
its oily way to the surface, had 



had enough, and popped through 
the tension holding him, freeing 
himself into flight. 

He crossed the square, not hear- 
ing any pursuit, not looking to see 
if it by now was him they flowed 
upon, and hurled himself at the 
yellow brick wall, straight up, 
lunging staple by staple toward 
the smoky mouthpiece. There was 
a crowd shout behind him: “An 
escape!” 

Tall on its flared rim, swaying 
in the smoke, he risked looking 
down, peering awkwardly past 
the flour sack still clutched in his 
hand. He heard the mob roar, thin 
and eerie as the high whooping 
of terns, and saw the first figures 
swarming up the base of the chim- 
ney. He sobbed once, “Coming, 
Mother,” and flung the sack over 
the lip and into the pulsing chim- 
ney. He flung his arms wide, 
shouted his defiant acquiescence 
to the High Hunter, and fell head- 
long toward the peopled square. 

Inside, the stack temperature 
licked the wrapping off the floury 
powder as he fell and fell, and 
he heard the beginnings of the 
explosion so that it was no sur- 
prise when the great chimney 
erupted and fell with him. It 
crumbled at the base and came 
down quite majestically, remain- 
ing almost at the vertical through- 
out. The last third toppled and 
hit the ground all at once. Bang 
and bang. Brest bounced to his or 



74 



GALAXY 



somebody’s feet, nodding and 
smiling, although the brick dust 
obscured every thing and every 
body. The band played Billboard. 
Amid first and last things he 
could hear the Machine, thrum- 
ming, thrumming, and reached 
out blindly and painfully to open 
the door. 

In the clearer air inside, he saw 
the Clown at the wheel, but as he 
slid onto the yielding cushion 
there was no one there but him- 
self. He locked the door, the sec- 
ret and sacramental door. He 
reached behind him for the blan- 
ket, which was there, and shook 
it out, grabbing for the thermos. 
The cap was loose this time and 
screwed off, easy in his fingers. He 
smelled the bitter milky odor, 
shook out two white drops, and 
laid it deeply safe back in the 
blanket. He released the brake, 
clutching and shifting this time 
with practiced ease. 



His crowd seethed beyond the 
door, and through the windows he 
could just make out the smiling 
flower-faces of girls, applauding 
his aplomb, admiring his — 

Escape. 

He smoothed his red trousers 
over his stocky muscled legs, 
settled the red jacket over his 
heavied torso, explored his face 
with one sure hand for the surely 
putty nose. The other skin, al- 
ready in the obliquity of justice, 
was on the Lodge again, all shed 
tatters until another time. 

All the lights turned green. 

The giggling girls waved a 
promise and withdrew, and Brest, 
knowing the car could take it, 
started off in second with a roar. 
Music. It would be his custom as 
far as he could foresee to ride 
long distances every Funday, and 
this Funday was unlike any other. 
Applause.

ONTHE WALL OF THE LODGE

By WALLACE WEST Illustrated by RUVIDICH 

DAWNINGSBURGH 



A lean wind wails through the age-old 
avenues of Dawningsburgh. 

Mornings, it brings sand from surrounding hills and scrubs 
at fresh paint, neon signs endlessly 

proclaiming the city’s synthetic name and street markers 
in seven languages. 

At sunrise it prepares the dunes for footprints of 
scurrying guided tourists. 

When icy night clamps down and the intruders 
scamper to their hotels, 

the wind howls as it flings after them a day’s collection 
of paper cups, 

bottle caps and other picnic offal.

lARS! Cheats!” whimpered 
Betsy O’Reilly as she 
tossed on the lumpy bed of her 
third class room and recalled the 
sky poster that had hypnotized 
her. 

Now, Betsy was disappointed 
and bored. Slim, pretty, freckled 
and pert, but ten years older than 
she wished, she had mortgaged 
her secretarial salary to engage 
once more in The Eternal Quest. 
And, as always, the quest was 
proving futile. Eligible bachelors 
shunned Dawningsburgh as they 
did other expensive tourist traps. 
The “new friends” she had made 
were either loudmouthed, hairy 
miners en route to or from the 
orichalcum diggings, or middle- 
aged couples on tragic second 
honeymoons, or self-styled emigre 
artists and novelists intent on 
cadging free meals and any other 
favors that lonely females might 
grant. 

But maybe, Betsy tried to con- 
sole herself, there was something 
real here; something glamorous 
that she could find and cling to 
during the long months back in 
New York when she would have 
to subsist on soups and salads in 
order to pay her debt to Trans- 
Plan. Mars had been great, the 
guides insisted. Once, they said, 
it had even colonized Atlantis. 
Perhaps, under the sham and 
away from those awful conducted 
tours, something was still left that 



could make her feel a trifle less 
forlorn. 

Betsy jumped out of bed and 
rummaged in a closet. There it 
was! A heated emergency gar- 
ment equipped with plastic hel- 
met, air pack and a searchlight. 
Required by law but seldom used, 
since tourists were told to stay 
off the 60° below zero streets at 
night. 

Wriggling into the clumsy 
thing, she tested valves and 
switches as she had been in- 
structed. Then she tiptoed out of 
her cubbyhole, down a corridor 
and into the hotel lobby. 

The room clerk did not greet 
her with its usual trill. A robot, 
built on Earth as a “stand-in” for 
one of the vanished Martians, it 
had turned itself off when the last 
tourists left the dining room for 
their beds. But how lifelike it 
still looked, balancing on a perch 
behind the ornate plastic desk. 
And how human too, despite the 
obviously avian ancestory of the 
race it mimicked. What was it 
the guides had said about the 
way in which all intelligent life- 
forms so far discovered closely 
resembled one another? Why, 
even artificial Martians made the 
average human look drab and 
clumsy. 

Betsy circled the overdecorated 
room like a shadow and pushed 
against the street door. Escaping 
air whistled through the crack. 



78 



GALAXY 



“Miss!” squawked the clerk, 
triggered alive by the noise. 
“Don’t . 

She was outside by then and 
running through the crazy half- 
light thrown by Mars’s nearer and 
farther moons. Wind howled and 
tugged at her. Cold turned the 
breath from her helmet vent into 
snow. 

TF7HEN no pursuit developed 
she stopped, gasping, be- 
fore one of the open-air shops she 
had toured that afternoon. Five 
“Martians” bent stiffly over lathes 
and other machines, just where 
they had stopped after the last 
visitor departed. Hoarfrost mot- 
tled their leather harness, their 
downy red skins and the scars on 
their shoulders where atrophied 
wings had supposedly been am- 
putated. No breath came from 
their nostrils. How cold and small 
they looked! 

On impulse, she approached 
briskly. 

“Yes, Miss?” The , robot pro- 
prietor unkinked as its automatic 
relays turned it on. It came for- 
ward with a grimace meant to 
represent a smile. “You’re out 
very late. What may I show 
you?” Its voice was like a rusted 
bird song. 

“Tell me,” said she, “what the 
Martians really made here.” 

“Why, we design jewelry. Miss. 
I have some nice . .” 



“No, no!” she interrupted. 
“What did the real Martians make 
here? Surely not junk jewelry for 
tasteless tourists. Something 
beautiful, it must have been. 
Wind bells? Dreams? Snow- 
flakes? Please tell me.” 

The robot twittered and 
flinched like a badly made toy. 

“I d-do not understand,” it 
ventured at last. “I am not pro- 
grammed to answer such ques- 
tions. Perhaps the guides can do 
so. Now may I show you . .” 
“Thank you, no.” She touched 
the thing’s cold, six-fingered hand 
with quick compassion. “But I’ll 
ask the guides. Good night.” 

Back in the street, she began to 
retrace her tour of the afternoon. 
Here was what the guide had 
called a “typical home.” This time 
she did not disturb the mother, 
father and one furry child with 
budding wings who clustered 
about what experts thought must 
have been a telepathic amplifier. 
It did not work any longer — 
none but the coarsest Martian 
machines did — yet the frost- 
rimed robots sat stiffly enchanted 
before it, as they would do until 
the sun rose and tourists resumed 
their endless tramp. (The day’s 
last, she noted, had left an empty 
pop bottle in the mother’s lap.) 

Farther on she met a “police- 
man”, resplendent in metal har- 
ness, leaning forlornly against an 
anachronistic lamppost. Some 



DAWNINGSBURGH 



79 



late-prowling jokester had stuck 
a cigarette between its still lips. 

Surely not policemen here? 
She looked up at the fairy towers 
that laced the stars. Surely not 
in this grave place. It must be one 
of those human touches intro- 
duced by Trans-Planetary to 
make tourists smile and feel 
superior. Nevertheless, she re- 
moved the cigarette and ground 
it under her heel. 

After walking half a mile 
through the sand-whipped night, 
Betsy paused before a structure 
of translucent spires and flying 
buttresses where a library had 
once been housed. No robots were 
on duty there and no serious 
attempt had been made at restor- 
ation. No Champollion had 
appeared in the early days of 
exploration to decipher some 
Martian Rosetta stone, and by 
now the historical record had 
been hopelessly scrambled by 
souvenir hunters. 

But that didn’t matter really, 
they said. Outside of the tourist 
trade the only really valuable 
things on the dying planet were 
extensive deposits of orichalcum, 
an ore rich in pure radium. 
Thanks to the impartial mining 
monopoly established by Trans- 
Planetary twenty years ago, or- 
ichalcum supplied the nations of 
Earth with sinews of war which 
they had not yet dared use, and 
fuel for ships that were questing 



greedily farther and farther out 
into the darkness of space. 

So metal-paged books had long 
vanished from the library’s stacks 
and its sand-strewn halls were lit- 
tered with broken rolls of tape. 
How long would it be, she won- 
dered as she passed on with a 
sigh, before the guides realized 
that even those mute tapes could 
be sold as souvenirs? 

I3HOBOS had set by now. She 
turned on the searchlight, 
checked her air tank — the gauge 
showed enough reserve for an- 
other hour — and defiantly opened 
the face plate of her helmet. The 
atmosphere was cold; cold as a 
naked blade. It had a heady tang 
and she stood taking in great 
gulps of it until a warning dizzi- 
ness forced her to close the plate. 
The guides were wrong again! A 
human could learn to breathe 
this air! 

Leaving the gutted library, 
Betsy breasted the wind as she 
ploughed through shifting dunes 
toward a structure shimmering on 
the other side of the plaza. This, 
the guides pattered, was a cathe- 
dral. When the place now called 
Dawningsburgh had been alive, 
they said, its inhabitants gathered 
at the shrine each evening to sip 
one ceremonial drink of precious 
water, shed two ceremonial tears 
for the days when Mars had been 
young and worship a flock of ata- 



80 



GALAXY 



vistic winged princesses who per- 
formed ceremonial flights under 
a pressurized, transparent dome 
in the rays of the setting sun. 

This showplace had, of course, 
been restored right down to its 
last perch, and had been equipped 
with a full complement of “wor- 
shippers.” At the climax of each 
day’s final guided tour, visitors 
jammed themselves into the nave, 
sipped cocktails, “ohed”, “ahed” 
and even shed tears along with 
the robots as they gawked at man- 
nequins flying above them on in- 
visible wires in the best Peter Pan 
tradition. 

Ducking under the electric eye 
that would have started a per- 
formance, Betsy tiptoed into the 
structure. It was quieter than any 
grave. Several hundred robots 
huddled there on their perches, 
drinks in hand, ready to go into 
their act. At the far end of the 
transept a soaring mural, gleam- 
ing phosphorescently, hinted at 
the lakes, seas and forests of 
Mars’s prehistory. Under the 
dome a single flyer dangled, its 
plumes trailing. 

For long minutes Betsy stood 
in the dimness, seeking to cap- 
ture the mystery and wonder of 
this place. In ruins, it would have 
swept her with ecstasy, as had 
her moonlit view of the Parthe- 
non. Restored and “repopulated,” 
it made her sick and ashamed of 
her race . no, not of her race. 



exactly, but of the few hucksters 
who debased its thirst for knowl- 
edge and beauty. 

Then a bird started to sing! 

A bird? On Mars? This must 
be a tape, triggered on somehow 
despite her care in avoiding the 
electric eye. Any moment now, 
the robots would begin their mind- 
less worship. 

She shuddered and turned to 
escape. But something held her. 
She crept instead, step by sound- 
less step, toward the source of 
that exquisite music. 

An almost naked male robot 
had materialized before the mu- 
ral. It was singing, far better than 
any nightingale, its strange hands 
outstretched to the radiance. 

Such notes could not . should 
not . spring from the throat 
of a machine. Heart in mouth, 
Betsy advanced with infinite care. 
By the mural’s light she saw that 
the newcomer had no hoarfrost 
coating. And the moisture of its 
breath condensed and fell to the 
floor like a blessing. She reached 
out a small hand to touch its 
scarred shoulder, then jerked 
back. 

The shoulder was warm! 

44^REETINGS, girl,” Betsy’s 
brain whispered to her. 
“You’re out late. Just let me finish 
this thing and we’ll have a chat.” 

The music soared, uninter- 
rupted, to a climax sparkling with 



DAWNINGSBURGH 



81 



grace notes and glittering with 
chromatic trills. 

“Now,” fluted the creature, 
turning and fixing her with gold- 
en, freewheeling eyes, “what 
brings a tourist” (the word was a 
curse) “here at this hour?” 

“L-love,” she gulped, hardly 
knowing what she said. “I-I mean, 
I wanted to find out if anything 
real was left. And, well, I ran 
away from the hotel. They’ll be 
coming after me, I suppose.” 
“Don’t fret. Martians can play 
tricks with time. I’ll return you to 
your room well before they get 
here.” 

“You — you’re not just an- 
other, fancier, robot?” 

“I’m alive enough.” He bowed 
with a sweep that seemed to in- 
vest him with wings. “Pitaret 
Mura, at your service. A prince- 
ling of sorts. An iconoclast. And 
an atavist like you.” 

“There are others here?” Her 
eyes grew round. 

“Most of the others have fin- 
ished with this outgrown eyrie and 
are away on larger affairs. Only I 
return with a few friends once 
each year to sing of past glories 
and weep over present desecra- 
tions.” 

“Two ceremonial tears?” she 
asked with a return of bitterness. 
There was something in his at- 
titude that she found disquieting. 

“Many more than two. But . .” 
he shrugged angrily, “I grow tired 



of weeping. On this visit I plan to 
wipe out you little humans who 
foul the nest of my ancestors.” 

“How?” She gripped his arm, 
fear racing through her. 

“Tomorrow all this junk — ” he 
nodded his handsome head at the 
robots — “will have been replaced 
by real Martians . youngsters 
out for a lark with me. We’ll tend 
shop, make jewelry and all that 
until I give a signal. Perhaps this 
shrine would be the best place. 
When it’s crowded, just at sunset. 
Then we pounce!” 

Mura ruffled himself up and 
sprang at her so convincingly that 
she shrieked. 

“How juvenile!” she managed 
to laugh shakily. 

“What did you say, human?” 
The Pitaret was taken aback by 
this unexpected thrust. 

“I said your plan is childish!” 
She stamped her foot. “So you cut 
the throats of a few stupid people. 
Then Earth sends up cobalt 
bombs and blows this cradle of 
Martian civilization to smither- 
eens. The others won’t like that, 
even if they are occupied with 
larger affairs. You would be in 
real trouble.” 

“Hmmm!” He looked at her 
with new respect and a faint tinge 
of uncertainty. “But some punish- 
ment is justified. Even you can 
see that.” 

“Yes,” she admitted, wrinkling 
her nose at him, now that the 



82 



GALAXY 



worst was over. “This place is a 
horror. And we tourists are hor- 
rors too, for having let ourselves 
be taken in by it. But death isn’t 
punishment, just an ending.” 

“I hadn’t thought of it that 
way.” Mura slipped an arm 
around her shoulders and looked 
down at her impishly. “You sug- 
gest a fitting punishment then.” 

TTERE was the final test. If she 
could keep the hold that she 
had somehow gained over this 
immature superman, horrible 
things might be averted. Her 
thoughts raced in circles. 

“Martians can play tricks with 
time?” she asked at last. 

“Oh, yes. Time is like this mu- 
ral. Let me show you: Aim your 
light at the left-hand corner of 
the picture. See the sun and its 
planets forming out of cosmic

toward the right. Slowly . Slow- 
ly! Notice how Martian oceans 
form and living things crawl out 
of them. 

“Now continue. There you see 
the winged Martians with their 
cities that long have crumbled to 
dust. Next, water grows scarce 
and canals are built. Here all but 
a few of us have lost our wings. 

“Here we colonize Earth . 
to our eternal regret. Finally, you 
see us abandon Mars rather than 
risk another test of strength with 
you pushing troglodytes.” 



“I-I don’t understand,” she 
whispered, strangely moved. 

“That searchlight beam repre- 
sents the living present. Where it 
shines, life pulses briefly on a vast 
mural that is painted across time, 
from its beginning to its end. Mar- 
tians manipulate the light of the 
present as we please, living when 
we please, so long as we please.” 
“How dreadful . Wonderful, 
I mean.” She gazed at him wor- 
shipfully. “And you can do this 
for humans too?” 

“For short periods, yes. But 
stop fluttering your lovely eye- 
lashes at me. Punished you are 
going to be. If you can suggest 
nothing better than my plan. I’ll 
go back to it and take the con- 
sequences. Otherwise I’ll be tbe 
laughing stock of my friends.” 
“And you couldn’t stand that, 
could you, poor boy?” She patted 
his hand before he snatched it 
away. “How is this, then, for an 
alternative? Tonight, when I 
couldn’t sleep, I got to thinking 
that there could be no more fit-

to be forced to live, for years and

“Of course,” Mura crowed as he 
swept her into his downy arms 
and danced her about among the 
robot perches. “A wonderful idea. 
You’re a genius. Even the others 
may come back, now, to watch 
humans squirm, yawn — and per-

How can I repay you?”

felt cleaner now, even though the

appalled her. To be forty-one and 
still single when she returned to

We plumb again the Origins 
of Almost Everything — and 
meet the great philosopher 
who first learned Nothing!

OF 

OALACTIC 

PHILOSOPHY 



O N 300 day, 4004 U.E., the 
Radiation Disposal Corpo- 
ration spacetug Oebouk, 
Sirius I registry, was in deep 
space jettisoning radioactive 
wastes. It was engaging in the 
questionable practice of dumping 
the stuff in packets at meaning- 
ful intervals. Captain Goshall 
Rovwymu — as he tells us in his 
unblushing memoirs My Nine 
Lives — having accepted an un- 
der-the-table proposition. 



Illustrated by IVIE 




These faint chalkings on the 
blackboard of nothingness were 
to spell out in dots of computer 
morse a subliminal message urg- 
ing prospects to buy Shuvh 
Transmutating Metal Polish. “I 
wouldn’t give a plugged dysaub 
for a shipload of Shuvh,” the 
captain tells us. But this was his 
first dealing with the mighty Ad 
Astra Agency, which handled the 
Shuvh account, and he meant to 
turn in a neat job. 

The craft was parsecs out in 
reaches where the pull of stars 
would not blur the message. But 
when Goshall took off his cap- 
tain cap and put on his astro- 
gator cap he spotted at once that 
the line of message was bellying 
out of true. He traced the in- 
fluence to an asteroid where no 
asteroid should be. He put on his 
captain cap and ordered the 
launch out to investigate. 

The launch sniffed around and 
determined that under the en- 
crusting and pitting the object 
was no asteroid but a vast ship. 
The launch matched the spin of 
the ship, clanged airlock to air- 
lock, and knocked. The tapping 
evoked no response. Sensing Cap>- 
tain Goshall on remote breath- 
ing down its eye, the launch 
forced the spaceship’s lock. 

It poked its scanner down a 
dusty passage. It found no sign of 
sentient life, but found in its 
sampling of hydroponics-fed air 



no danger to life. Capt. Goshall 
thought salvage and his mind 
teemed with astronomical figures. 
He recalled the launch, put on 
his boarding party cap, strapped 
on his freezer and sent himself 
to the derelict. 

The air seemed moldy but he 
let his chest inflate. Now and 
again he had to back through a 
creeping of hydroponics jungle 
but deck after deck was jammed 
full of perfectly sound equipment. 
Out-of-date, of course, but there 
were a myriad primitive planets 
to unload it on. After a particu- 
larly ferocious snarl of jungle he 
was glad to come on a smile of 
clearing. A park, he guessed, for 
beside a bench-rimmed, dust-cov- 
ered pool stood what he saw as a 
surrealistic statue. He laughed. 
“I wonder what you stand for,” 
he said, and switched on his non- 
wipe timestream tape to record 
his claim to the ship. 

He froze. 

He thought he had heard a 
voice saying, “I stand for the 
purpose of greeting you. That 
and nothing more.” 

The statue was moving 
squeakily. Not a statue but a 
robot. 

OSHALL’S hand shot casu- 
ally to his freezer. If he had 
heard aright the robot knew 
lingua galactica. “Hello, there. 
I am—” 



86 



GALAXY 



“Yes. I see you, therefore you 
are.” 

Capt. Goshall didn’t like this 
talk from robots. “Where’s your 
master?” 

“Determinism is all about us.” 
Goshall glanced uneasily 
around. He looked more closely 
at the robot. There was no ex- 
pression to read but the left eye 
seemed remarkably real. With a 
chill of insight Capt. Goshall had 
a vision of a knight in armor. 
“You mean there’s someone in- 
side you? I mean, you’re inside 
that?” 

The robot tapped itself, had a 
spell of coughing, then said, “In 
a material sense, this is me. I’m 
Lutil. I came into being — flesh- 
and-blood being — on Atik I. I’m 
one of the last surviving mem- 
bers of the SMP detachment.” 
Capt. Goshall introduced him- 
self, then said, “What happened 
to the others?” 

“Time. Come, I’ll show you.” 
Lutil started down a spongy 
path. Capt. Goshall followed 
down a companionway. 

Lutil indicated cubicles. “Ob- 
serve. Here, in what we liked to 
term our ‘logic-tight compart- 
ments,’ we lived and contem- 
plated, separately concentrating.” 
He stopped suddenly; Capt. Gos- 
hall stopped and looked around, 
hand on freezer. “Or should I 
say ‘concentrating separately?’ ” 
He got under way again. “We’re 



coming to the premises for female 
aides.” 

Capt. Goshall reached for his 
boarding party cap, to give it an 
elbow-brushing, and discovered 
that in his initial excitement, 
back aboard the Oebouk, he had 
forgotten to remove his astro- 
gator and captain caps. But they 
were moving past tenantless 
rooms. Another companionway 
brought them to a compartment 
containing a bulkhead-to-bulk- 
head computer. 

“Observe.” 

They stood watching its crys- 
tals pulse feebly. 

“Very nice,” Capt. Goshall 
said at last, “but where are the 
other survivors?” 

Lutil patted the computer. 
“This is the other survivor.” 

The crystals brightened. 
“Hello, Lutil. Say, I’ve hit on 
four identical bars in Verdi’s 
Otello, a Dwenolhep commercial, 
and Gounod’s Romeo et Juliette.^' 
Lutil patted the computer. 
“Fine, fine.” He touched Capt. 
Goshall’s arm. When they were 
out of photoelectricshot Lutil said, 
“Poor thing. We tried musical 
therapy. Now all it does is that 
sort of business.” 

“Oh?” 

“Yes, we asked too much of it. 
But it was no more than we 
asked of ourselves. To you it may 
seem vanity, but our aim was 
nothing less than to grasp the 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC PHILOSOPHY 



87 



universe whole. Is* this my com- 
partment?” They had returned 
to the cubicles and Lutil ushered 
Goshall into one and gestured 
him to a chair. “It makes no 
difference now. I was saying, we 
philosophers of the various 
worlds agreed on one thing — 
that different p»oints of view led 
to different images of the struc- 
ture of reality. We sought a uni- 
fying vision, hoping to obtain a 
functional view of reality. To ac- 
complish collectively what we 
could not attain individually in 
the turbulence of life, we planned 
a Symposium on Metagalactic 
Philosophy. With backing from 
foundations we bought and 
equipped this spaceship and 
hired maintenance personnel. 
This was to be our ivory tower, 
a place where, away from violence 
and corruption, we could placidly 
deliberate. Beginning circa 2000 
U. E., the SMP ship planet- 
hopped, gathering savants. I my- 
self came aboard in 2085.” 

Lutil was pacing. Capt. Gos- 
hall saw that over the centuries 
Lutil had paced grooves of 
thought in the flooring. The span 
of years — 2085 to 4004 — sud- 
denly struck him. 

“How do you account for 
your senior-citizenship?” 

“By the fact that it is not 
quite my own.” 

“You’ve lost me.” 

“I see you, albeit blurredly, so 



I take that to be an idiom ex- 
pressing perplexity.” 

“Yeah.” 

“Well, then, the others of the 
contingent knew me to be the 
last surviving adherent of the 
Observationist school. I main- 
tained nothing can exist unless 
there’s an observer to observe it. 
In spite of their disbelief, every- 
one was most kind to me. They 
did their utmost to prolong my 
existence, giving me first draw 
on the SMP’s mechanatomical 
prosthetics bank. As you see, I’m 
largely patchwork. I believe it 
was for my sake — to strengthen 
my belief — rather than as a 
self-preservative measure on their 
part that they did this. If so, 
it’s sufficient reason to feel grate- 
ful that they haven’t lived to 
learn I’ve grown zealproof, doc- 
trine-proof, and ultimately al- 
most — ” he curtailed a cynical 
laugh — “proof-proof. Inwardly, 
captain, I am smiling bitterly.” 

“You were saying — ” 

yes. About the ingather- 
ing. It was not without 
misadventure. I am in mind of 
Ojuras, the renowned promulga- 
tor of Upspiraling Awareness. 
The SMP ship put in at Svati I 
to pick up Ojuras. The registrar 
at first thought Ojuras was a no- 
show. She got no response when 
she called Ojuras’s home. On an 
off-chance, she searched the ship 



88 



GALAXY 



itself. In the hold, atop a heap of 
Ojuras’s effects, a portly svatii 
sat — amid the clangor and 
turmoil of servicing, loading and 
refueling — with eyes closed as 
in deep meditation. Smiling, the 
registrar trundled him bodily to 
the assigned cubicle. 

“Falirj wakened from a dream 
of repast. Through the port he 
saw stars. He sprang to his feet. 
The door opened and a serving 
tray wheeled itself in and 
arranged itself temptingly. A 
lesser being, without stopping to 
think, might have opened his 
mouth to shout his identity; it 
should not be too late to shoot 
him home. Falirj opened his 
mouth to devour the meal. The 
registrar followed, hastily in- 
formed Falirj she wasn’t the 
dessert, and asked if he were 
comfortable. Falirj was already 
nodding off. Pleased, the registrar 
tiptoed out and left the savant 
to his meditating. 

“When next Falirj wakened a 
welcoming delegation was wait- 
ing on him. Falirj looked about 
at a wisp of beards — a field 
day for Occam’s razor — and 
his heart failed him. He started to 
tell them he was not the person 
they thought him. Their head 
silenced him. Sat. Rang. A ban- 
quet table entered. Falirj found 
it useless — with his mouth full 
— to protest. They thought he 
was being modest. They pre- 



sented him with the SMP in- 
signia — glasses to wear pushed 
up on the brow. Speeches. When 
next he wakened he found him- 
self alone. 

“He shuddered to think what 
the effect would be on their feel- 
ings when they learned he wasn’t 
the great Ojuras. His serving tray 
wheeled in. So it went. Now and 
again a savant had the wish to 
consult him on finer points of his 
forte. But the others looked 
daggers of the mind at any who 
would disturb the great Ojuras. 
And so, save for his own pro- 
found snoring, an almost tangible 
hush insulated Falirj. 

“Some thought they saw what 
the great Ojuras was getting at. 
Ultimate Awareness. His very 
example was a teaching that 
sleep, instead of being a mere 
means of restoring vitality to the 
individual, was an end. ‘Dreams’ 
were the ‘real” life. Whereas 
most mortals compromise their 
‘dreams’ in order to meet the 
‘realities,’ the indomitable Ojuras 
compromised ‘reality’ in order to 
meet his ‘dream.’ His strict ob- 
servance of his discipline won 
many philosophers over to his 
doctrine, though none could excel 
him, by the time the ship sta- 
tioned itself hereabouts. 

“And when in fullness of time 
he went to his eternal dream his 
name carried glory, even after it 
came out that he was Falirj, a

porter. As it did when the ship 
received a plaintive message 
from the true Ojuras, who — 
concentrating on being aware, on 
being aware of being aware, on 
being aware of being aware of 
being aware ... — had been un- 
aware till too late that the ship 
had long since arrived and de- 
parted.” 

^APT. Goshall stood up. Now 
that he knew the ship was not 
a derelict, ending all hope of 
salvage, there seemed no percent- 
age in remaining aboard. “Speak- 
ing of going — ” 

“Ah, yes, captain. Dear old 
Falirj was not the first to go. 
That was the distinguished 
philosopher Oxnovomri, Inten- 
sional Entropist of Alcyone IV. 
How often I saw this parrotoid 
run screaming through the ship, 
terrified by the ultimate annihila- 
tion of space-time. At length it 
collapsed of exhaustion. But Ox- 
novomri did not die of exhaus- 
tion. While the parrotoid was 
recuperating the medical officer 
found a throbbing cyst on its 
person. The medical officer pre- 
pared to excise it. The cyst grew 
strangely calm, as though watch- 
ing with detached interest its 
own impending doom. After the 
operation, the parrotoid resumed 
its running about with all its old 
vigor. It screamed the same warn- 
ing, but it was not the same. And 



then we learned philosopher Ox- 
novomri had been the cyst. It 
came of a parasitic line, each 
being essentially a wen on and 
using the vocal apparatus of its 
host parrotoid.” 

Capt. Goshall edged away. 

Lutil took his arm. “Shall we 
stretch our legs? No, not that 
way, I don’t want to set the poor 
computer off again. Oh, forgive 
me, you’re no doubt impatient to 
hear what set it off in the first 
place. It’s gestalt-oriented, you 
know, trained to discover simi- 
larities, analogies in masses of 
data, to correlate cycles, and the 
like. With its help we hoped to 
achieve our unifying vision. 

“Each of us philosophers re- 
duced his theory to holes 
punched in tape. The computer 
swallowed all this. We then fed 
it the basis theorem and the 
decomposition theorem for ideals 
of a cumulative field with as- 
cending chain condition. We 
crowded around, watching the 
pulsing. Chill of anticipation. We 
knew the computer should be 
able to comprehend the universe 
as a single coherent function. We 
stared. We knew it had the an- 
swer. We asked it to tell us. It 
moved to answer. Then we saw 
it was mad, quite mad. 

“After that, most of us resigned 
ourselves to the reality that in 
the last analysis the real is un- 
realizable. Oh, but not Czomec. 



90 



GALAXY 



46/^ZOMEC of Anonymous I 
was the father of Fixed- 
Introspectionism. I can see him 
now, discoursing, turning his eye 
patches on his hearers. ‘Finite 
mind can’t cope with infinite 
universe? Can.’ Czomec believed 
the world of perception, the in- 
ternal world of the mind, was not 
simply a correlate of the external 
world but was part of the ex- 
ternal world. He believed any 
sampling of the universe would 
give insight into the essential 
nature of the whole. He believed 
it followed that his mind would 
reflect not merely subjectively 
but also objectively the reality 
of nature. 

“And so Czomec turned his 
mind’s eye in upon itself. At last 
in fear and trembling he an- 
nounced he could see the universe 
steady and see it whole. He 
would map it for us. We crowded 
around Czomec and watched 
while he traced his inner vision 
on 3D paper. Finally he let his 
pen drop and fell back faint. 

“We stared, amazed. Was that 
what the continuum came to in 
the end? It had a spongy look. 
One likened it to moss. A closer 
look showed it to be replete with 
folds — seeming to give substance 
to ancient conjectures of time 
and/or space warps. Then one 
diffidently mentioned the thought 
it had much the aspect of a 
nerve-ganglion. And at that we 



saw it steady and saw it whole. 
We saw it as the concatenation 
of Czomec’s own brain cells.” 

“Whether or not it was in 
reaction to this, many turned to 
the quest of unreality. Camestres 
of Sol II loudly demanded that 
we condense the ship’s atmos- 
phere to thick fog to give an air 
of unreality to the place. Wiser 
lungs prevailed. 

“The problem remained. 
‘Where does Truth lie?’ The cold 
light of reason should have helped 
to determine that. But, as the 
computer and Czomec both had 
shown, the cold light of reason 
was as the light of a dead star. 
My adherence to Observationism 
began to weaken. If the universe 
began to take on a new look at 
about that time perhaps it was 
not simply because I was seeing 
it with a new eye. 

“At many a get-together over 
our cups we sought the solution, 
the animating principle, with 
such good fellowship and such 
careful and precise talk that we 
often thought we had found the 
answer. It would be later, when 
we listened soberly to the play- 
back of our discussion, that we 
would realize what we had taken 
for meaningful universals were 
drunken maunderings.” 

T UTIL turned away, but not 
before Capt. Goshall saw the 
start of a tear at the right eye.

“Now I am not sure that we 
were not closer to the True Spirit. 
But at the time I agreed with 
the majority that reason must 
prevail. Among the measures we 
took to minimize the possibility 
of irrational thinking was that of 
putting up a shield against cosmic 
rays. This because of the assump- 
tion that their bombarding 
touched off random thoughts and 
actions. This had to overcome 
fierce opposition from Dwal 
Eglan of Beid I. 

“Dwal nominally held to the 
meaningful maxim of the Ambi- 
guist school. ‘Nothing is mean- 
ingless.’ None of the Ambiguists 
would or could give a straight 
answer as to its meaning. To me, 
it implies that any meaningless 
noise is potentially meaningful 
— just as weeds are plants whose 
virtues have not yet been discov- 
ered. I’m not sure whether Dwal 
himself took it as stating the 
rationality of the absurd or, con- 
trariwise, the absurdity of the 
rational. At any rate, he appeared 
to believe that in an infinity of 
universes there must be a universe 
without purpose. And he seemed 
to have concluded that from an 
empirical point of view this was 
it. Ever since I had known Dwal, 
which was ever since he had come 
aboard, he had deliberately 
spoken gibberish. I inferred that 
he aimed at all costs to avoid 
meaning, that he hoped thereby 



to come nearer apprehending this 
absurd bit of space-time. 

“At first mention of the pro- 
posal to screen out the bombard- 
ing rays Dwal went around 
muttering his usual deliberate 
nonsense with extra emphasis. 
‘Uv-uzl-uzl!’ As the proposal 
gained in favor his nonsense 
gained in fervor. ‘Za-zeq-zeq! Ij- 
inz-inz!’ You will forgive possible 
distortions in my rendering? As 
he strove never to repeat himself 
his was no mean feat. He must 
have known better than we the 
danger he ran of finding himself 
out of nonsense. But he muttered 
bravely, ‘Tu-tyk-tyk! De-diu-diu!’ 
And some of us wavered. The 
staunchest of us looked despera- 
tely for signs that Dwal was 
nearing the end, signs of logical 
rigor. But he had nonsense in 
reserve. ‘Op-otf-otf!’ It was his 
last trumpet-call. It was clear that 
if he spoke he would have to 
speak meaningfully. Frustration 
struck him speechless and his 
nay-saying had to manifest itself 
in glaring. That no doubt hastened 
his end. I’m sure it would’ve 
pleased him that owing to some 
malfunctioning of thrust the 
coffin-rocket headed his corpse 
toward an anti-matter galaxy.”

forbore to protest as Lutil 
seated him beside the pool. Lutil

bent to pluck a butterwort, then 
had compunction and straight- 
ened stiffly. 

“Oh, vanity, vanity. With your 
sigh, captain, you have expressed 
it admirably, beyond the power 
of words.” He gazed into the 
pool. “Ah, yes. By this pool the 
Psychosocial philosopher Gurn- 
gev of Dhalim I spent years 
meditating on the best way of 
conducting one’s life. For the bet- 
ter part of those years he never 
lost sight of his objctive. He kept 
his thoughts moving in a virtuous 
circle. Then unrest beset him. 
Although he kept brushing the 
thought away it came back, nag- 
ging him that he had forgotten 
something vital that he should 
have remembered. 

“One ship’s day, for the exer- 
cise, he made for the stock room 
instead of dialing his want. 
Pigeonholes. Reigning categorists 
and dogmatists. Titanic Teutonic 
piling up of reference materials. 
He was lost. Then he saw Raie, 
the supply clerk, moving supply 
toward him through the stacks. 
He told her he was looking for 
categorical imperatives. Vivaci- 
ously Raie set about helping him 
hunt. After a vigorous but vain 
while he said, ‘You do know what 
I mean?’ Raie said, ‘To be honest, 
I don’t.’ And she laughed gaily. 
‘Let’s be honest, after all, shall 
weP’ Shaken by he knew not what 
wind of emotion Gurngev grabbed 



a microvolume at random, smiled 
his thanks, and returned here. 

“He sat down to meditate. His 
thoughts strayed and he brought 
them back to the fold with diffi- 
culty. Abstractedly he smoothed 
his elliptical mustache. He found 
himself gazing into the pool. He 
saw with a shock how gray his 
hair had grown. That evening he 
proposed to Raie and she, loving 
impulsiveness, accepted. And so 
they affaired. 

“They had seven charming 
girls. Indeed, all offspring aboard 
ship were females. When it was 
too late to test, the theory oc- 
curred to us that screening out 
cosmic rays might have engen- 
dered this state of affairs. In any 
case, this factor and the preval- 
ence of platonic love were the 
major reasons for the dying out 
of SMP. 

“Of course all was not platonic 
love. Of course all was not har- 
mony. Of course there were dis- 
putes. I am smiling inwardly, 
captain, as one such comes to 
mind. In this corner was the Jim- 
nosophist, Fresion of Chara III. 
His method of philosophizing was 
to contort his face and furrow 
his brow in imitation of thinking, 
on James’s principle that emo- 
tion follows bodily change. In the 
other corner was the Biliarist, 
Dsulrul of Gomeisa II. Her

face in outward expression of in- 
ward struggle. 

“They clashed not on the issue 
of whether thought was a mode 
of emotional disturbance but on 
which came first, appearance or 
reality. When I attempted to 
bring this to their attention both 
turned on me and I desisted. 
Though their confrontations aj>- 
peared extremely fierce the dis- 
cussion between them never grew 
heated. Indeed, on the principle 
that hate is akin to love they 
set up housekeeping together. 

Tegmine IX came 
another couple, though 
whether loving or hating I never 
knew, Uain and his mate Yemr. 
Projective Stoics, each watched 
to see if the other was failing to 
bear up under pain or pleasure. 
But never once did either’s face 
give ansrthing away. At the ban- 
quet celebrating their 59th mat- 
ing anniversary each extolled the 
other in measured terms, for 
nothing had moved either — not 
fear, rage, jealousy, lust, revenge, 
love, hatred. 

“It was a moving occasion but 
neither showed signs of emotion 
— till, proud of having stifled her 
feelings for so long, Yemr in- 
voluntarily gave a groan of 
pleasure. She clapped her hands 
to her mouth and her face teet- 
ered on the fulcrum of nose, 
disclosing that she wore a mask. 



In putting his hands protectively 
over his face Uaim unmasked 
himself. Having lost face, neither 
could bear to meet the other 
again. 

“Now I am frowning sadly, 
captain, for I call to mind another 
contretemps which had truly 
serious consequences. A shocking 
event, terrible at the time and 
disturbing even to recall — ” 

“If you’d rather not — ” 

“It involved on the one hand 
Fwyslanwushstadalq of Pollux I. 
Owing to the pervasive lumi- 
nosity of his home planet all 
substance there was without 
shadow. This gave rise to a sense 
of unsubstantiality. Fwyslan- 
wushstadalq’s Interstitch philo- 
sophy epitomized this world-view, 
I can sum up his philosophy by 
saying that he held all nets are 
as much complexes of nots as of 
knots. His doctrine called for at 
once countering a positive state- 
ment with its negative. 

“And on the other hand it 
involved Radu of Nodus Secun- 
dus IX. At first meeting and for 
some time thereafter, old Fwys- 
lanwushstadalq thought Radu 
was of a mind with him. The 
excessive libration of Radu’s 
home planet induced a permanent 
wobbling in the inhabitants — 
not noticeable till they left the 
planet. When Radu came aboard, 
his way of shaking no and say- 
ing yes, and vice versa, at once

warmed Fwyslanwushstadalq to 
him. 

“But this wobbling couldn’t 
have been more misleading. Radu 
couldn’t stand ambiguity; he 
was partial to the all-inclusive. 
Fwyslanwushstadalq would say, 
‘The obsolete absolute presup- 
poses a fixed indeterminacy’ — 
or something to that effect — and 
that would cause Radu to catch 
him up, saying, ‘But now you’re 
contradicting yourself.’ And 
Fwyslanwushstadalq, thinking 
Radu was nodding approvingly, 
would say, ‘I thank you.’ And if 
Radu had not been wobbling he 
would have been trembling with 
fury. 

“But once the venerable Fwys- 
lanwushstadalq learned that 
every nod was part of an all-in- 
clusive repudiating the fury was 
all his. The sage mustered his 
strength, took up a bust of Plato 
and, wielding it as a mace, came 
at Radu. Radu’s wobbling frus- 
trated Fwyslanwushstadalq, who 
sought to pepper Radu with 
blows but landed not one. Fur- 
ther hampering Fwyslanwushsta- 
dalq was the fact that his SMP in- 
signia slipped down his brow and 
covered his eyes. 

assault flailed on, but 
Radu was safe so long as 
he made no move. But when, 
through failure of nerve or 
through seeking to get in a gin- 



gerly lick of his own, he made a 
move, the backswing of a blow 
Fwyslanwushstadalq had aimed 
at his own shadow clove Radu’s 
skull. It quickly proved the end 
for both. As Fwyslanwushstadalq 
bent mourning over his dead foe, 
he too received a fatal blow. Radu 
had lashed out in tricky rigor 
mortis.” 

Lutil tenoned Capt. Goshall 
with an eye. “There’s an im- 
portant issue here. You’re not to 
confuse Fwyslanwushstadalq’s 
doctrine with the 180°-ism of 
Zvypalz, the pre-eminent Vector- 
ist of Wasat III. Zvypalz, know- 
ing his disciples would distort his 
teachings, taught the opposite of 
what he actually believed and 
wanted.” 

“No. I mean yes.” 

“Looking back, captain, I feel 
much as Spage must have felt. 
He was the supreme exponent of 
Retrogradism, you know. As he 
would say, ‘A fly in amber can’t.’ 
That was his way of declaring 
that to comprehend the present, 
which in his view was^a synthesis 
of past and future, it was neces- 
sary to wait till it was past. 

“Retrogradism itself was an 
outgrowth of Quotidianism. As 
an antidote to giving way to a 
sense of crisis and foreboding the 
Quotidianists read the paper 
daily — but it was the paper of 
that day of a preceding year, all 
the crises of the year before hav-

ing resolved themselves one way 
or the other. 

“Spage came aboard with 
microfiles of Dhalim I newspapers 
spanning the past ten years and 
with a mind blank to the hap- 
penings of those years. He began 
his studies. He rigidly refrained 
from peeking ahead. To back his 
won’tpower the tamperproof 
viewer would not advance faster 
than the regulation issue per day. 
So it went. Then tragedy threat- 
ened. You no doubt recall the 
disaster that befell Spage’s home 
planet?” \ 

“Uh— ” 

“So naturally no new issues 
would be forthcoming. We shrank 
from thought of telling Spage and 
equally from thought of letting 
him learn abruptly. Meanwhile 
the microfiles were running out, 
nearing the issue of the day Spage 
left home for the SMP ship. The 
supplement to bring him up to 
antedate did not and would not 
arrive. 

i4\¥7HILE we were wondering 
’’ what to do, the viewer, 
with its built-in dread of idleness, 
took it on itself to splice the end 
of the last issue to the beginning 
of the first. Those of us in the 
know held our breath, hoping 
Spage wouldn’t jump on encount- 
ering the abrupt transition. He 
did jump — but for joy. The 
return of the good old days 



confirmed his second-guessing 
that history ran in cycles. 

“Oh, to think we dreamed of 
becoming the Platonic essence of 
Philosophy, the eternal Philoso- 
phy in heaven! Vanity.” Lutil 
squeaked to an edge of the clear- 
ing and several steps through 
underbrush. He swept growth 
aside to uncover a port. He 
stared out, gazing thoughtfully at 
space-time and at his own image 
faintly imposed on it. 

Capt. Goshall started. Not only 
no salvage here, but he now saw 
he had wastefully left the precious 
nonwipe timestream tape — on 
which he had meant to stake his 
claim to the derelict — running 
all along. He would have hurled 
his caps down and jumped on 
them, his way of taking it philo- 
sophically, if Lutil’s thoughtful 
stance had not shamed him. Later 
Capt. Goshall was to splice this 
interview in his memoirs and so 
give our present-day philosophers 
to think. But at the moment his 
only thought was to make up for 
lost space-time. “Nice talking to 
you, but I’ve got to go.” He 
made as if to return to the 
Oebouk. 

Lutil coughed. “Er — ” He 
rubbed a discolored metallic jaw 
awkwardly. 

Capt. Goshall stopped. “Yes?” 

“I wonder if you know where 
I can get some Shuvh.”

TTE was a morning type, so it 
was unusual that he should 
feel depressed in the morning. He 
tried to account for it, and could 
not. 

He was a healthy man, so he 
ate a healthy breakfast. He was 
not too depressed for that. And he 
listened unconsciously to the dark 
girl with the musical voice. Often 



she ate at Cahill’s in the morn-

“My mother was a monster. 
She was a wart-hoggish animal. 
And yet she was still recognizable. 
How could my mother look like a 
wart-hog and still look like my 
mother? Mama’s pretty!” 

“Teresa, it was only a dream. 
Forget it.” 

The stares a man must suffer 
just to get a dozen pancakes on 
his plate! What was the matter 
with people who called four pan- 
cakes a tall stack? And what was 
odd about ordering a quarter of 
a pound of butter? It was better 
than having twenty of those little 
pats each on its coaster. 

“Agnes, we all of us had eyes 
that bugged out. And we stank! 
We were bloated, and all the time 
it rained a dirty green rain that 
smelled like a four letter word. 
Good grief, girl! We had hair all 
over us where we weren’t warts. 
And we talked like cracked 
crows. We had crawlers. I itch just 
from thinking about it. And the 
dirty parts of the dream I won’t 
even tell you. I’ve never felt so 
blue in my life. I just don’t know 
how I’ll make the day through.” 
“Teresa, doll, how could a 
dream upset you so much?” 

^^HERE isn’t a thing wrong with 
ordering three eggs sunny- 
side up, and three over easy, and 
three poached ever so soft, and 



six of them scrambled. What law 
says a man should have all of his 
eggs fixed alike? Nor is there any- 
thing wrong with ordering five 
cups of coffee. That way the girl 
doesn’t have to keep running over 
with refills. 

Bascomb Swicegood liked to 
have bacon and waffles after the 
egg interlude and the earlier 
courses. But he was nearly at the 
end of his breakfast when he 
jump)ed up. 

“What did she say?” 

He was surprised at the vio- 
lence of his own voice. 

“What did who say, Mr. Swice- 
good?” 

“The girl that was just here, 
that just left with the other girl.” 

“That was Teresa, and the 
other girl was Agnes. Or else that 
was Agnes and the other girl was 
Teresa. It depends on which girl 
you mean. I don’t know what 
either of them said.” 

Bascomb ran out into the 
street. 

“Girl, the girl who said it rained 
dirty green all the time, what’s 
your name?” 

“My name is Teresa. You’ve 
met me four times. Every morn- 
ing you look like you never saw 
me before.” 

“I’m Agnes,” said Agnes. 

“What did you mean it rained 
dirty green all the time? Tell me 
all about it.” 

“I will not, Mr. Swicegood. I

was just telling a dream I had to 
Agnes. It isn’t any of your busi- 
ness.” 

“Well, I have to hear all of it. 
Tell me everything you dreamed.” 

“I will not. It was a dirty dream. 
It isn’t any of your business. If 
you weren’t a friend of my Uncle 
Ed Kelly, I’d call a policeman for 
your bothering me.” 

“Did you have things like live 
rats in your stomach to digest for 
you? Did they — ” 

“Oh! How did you know? Get 
away from me. I will call a police- 
man. Mr. McCarty, this man is 
annoying me.” 

“The devil he is. Miss Ananias. 
Old Bascomb just doesn’t have it 
in him any more. There’s no more 
harm in him than a lamp post.” 

“Did the lamp posts have hair 
on them, Miss Teresa? Did they 
pant and swell and smell green — ” 

“Oh! You couldn’t know! You 
awful man!” 

“I’m Agnes,” said Agnes; but 
Teresa dragged Agnes away with 
her. 

“What is the lamp-post jag, 
Bascomb?” asked Officer Moss- 
back McCarty. 

“Ah — ^I know what it is like to 
be in hell, Mossback. I dreamed 
of it last night.” 

“And well you should, a man 
who neglects his Easter duty year 
after year. But the lamp-post jag? 
If it concerns anything on my 
beat, I have to know about it.” 



“It seems that I had the same 
depressing dream as the young 
lady, identical in every detail.” 

I^OT knowing what dreams are 

” (and we do not know) we 
should not find it strange that two 
people might have the same 
dream. There may not be enough 
of them to go around, and most 
dreams are forgotten in the morn- 
ing. 

Bascomb Swicegood had for- 
gotten his dismal dream. He 
could not account for his state of 
depression until he heard Teresa 
Ananias telling pieces of her own 
dream to Agnes Schoenapfel. 
Even then it came back to him 
slowly at first, but afterwards with 
a rush. 

The oddity wasn’t that two 
people should have the same 
dream, but that they should dis- 
cover the coincidence, what with 
the thousands of people running 
around and most of the dreams 
forgotten. 

Yet, if it were a coincidence, it 
was a multiplex one. On the night 
when it was first made manifest it 
must have been dreamed by quite 
a number of people in one medi- 
um-large city. There was a small 
piece in an afternoon paper. One 
doctor had five different worried 
patients who had had dreams of 
rats in their stomachs, and hair 
growing on the insides of their 
mouths. This was the first publica- 



DREAMWORLD 



101 



tion of the shared-dream phe- 
nomenon. 

The squib did not mention the 
foul-green-rain background, but 
later investigation uncovered that 
this and other details were com- 
mon to the dreams. 

But it was a reporter named 
Willy Wagoner who really put the 
town on the map. Until he did the 
job, the incidents and notices had 
been isolated. Doctor Herome 
Judas had been putting together 
some notes on the Green-Rain 
Syndrome. Doctor Florenz Ap- 
pian had been working up his evi- 
dence on the Surex Ventriculus 
Trauma, and Professor Gideon 
Greathouse had come to some 
learned conclusions on the inner 
meaning of warts. But it was 
Willy Wagoner who went to the 
people for it, and then gave his 
conclusions back to the people. 

Willy said that he had inter- 
viewed a thousand people at ran- 
dom. (He hadn’t really; he had 
talked to about twenty. It takes 
longer than you might think to 
interview a thousand people.) He 
reported that slightly more than 
sixty-seven per cent had had a 
dream of the same repulsive 
world. He reported that more 
than forty-four per cent had had 
the dream more than once, thirty- 
two per cent more than twice, 
twenty-seven per cent more than 
three times. Many had had it 
every damned night. And many 



refused frostily to answer ques- 
tions on the subject at all. 

This was ten days after Bas- 
comb Swicegood had heard 
Teresa Ananias tell her dream to 
Agnes. 

Willy published the opinions of 
the three learned gentlemen 
above, and the theories and com- 
ments of many more. He also ap- 
pended a hatful of answers he had 
received that were sheer levity. 

But the phenomenon was not 
local. Wagoner’s article was the 
first comprehensive (or at least 
wordy) treatment of it, but only 
by hours. Similar things were in 
other papers that very afternoon, 
and the next day. 

It was more than a fad. Those 
who called it a fad fell silent after 
they themselves experienced the 
dream. The suicide index arose 
around the country and the world. 
The thing was now international. 
The cacaphonous ditty Green 
Rain was on all the jukes, as was 
The Wart-Hog Song. People be- 
gan to loathe themselves and each 
other. Women feared that they 
would give birth to monsters. 
There were new perversions com- 
mitted in the name of the thing, 
and several orgiastic societies 
were formed with the stomach rat 
as a symbol. All entertainment 
was forgotten, and this was the 
only topic. 

Nervous disorders took a fear- 
ful rise as p>eople tried to stay 



102 



GALAXY 



awake to avoid the abomination, 
and as they slept in spite of them- 
selves and suffered the degrada- 
tion. 

TT is no joke to experience the 
same loathsome dream all 
night every night. It had actually 
come to that. All the people were 
dreaming it all night every night. 
It had passed from being a joke to 
being a universal menace. Even 
the sudden new millionaires who 
rushed their cures to the market 
were not happy. They also suf- 
fered whenever they slept, and 
they knew" that their cures were 
not cures. 

There were large amounts 
posted for anyone who could cure 
the populace of the wart-hog- 
people dreams. There was presi- 
dential edict and dictator decree, 
and military teams attacked the 
thing as a military problem, but 
they were not able to subdue it. 

Then one night a nervous lady 
heard a voice in her noisome 
dream. It was one of the repulsive 
cracked wart-hog voices. “You are 
not dreaming” said the voice. 
“This is the real world. But when 
you wake you will be dreaming. 
That barefaced world is not a 
world at all. It is only a dream. 
This is the real world.” The lady 
awoke howling. And she had not 
howled before, for she was a de- 
mure lady. 

Nor was she the only one who 



awoke howling. There were hun- 
dreds, then thousands, then mil- 
lions. The voice spoke to all and 
engendered a doubt. Which was 
the real world? Almost equal time 
was now spent in each, for the 
people had come to need more 
sleep and most of them had ar- 
rived at spending a full twelve 
hours or more in the nightmarish 
world. 

“It could be” was the title of a 
headlined article on the subject 
by the same Progressor Great- 
house mentioned above. It could 
be, he said, that the world on 
which the green rain fell inces- 
santly was the real world. It could 
be that the wart-hogs were real 
and the people a dream. It could 
be that rats in the stomach were 
normal, and other methods of di- 
gestion were chimerical. 

And then a very great man 
went on the air in worldwide 
broadcast with a speech that was 
a ringing call for collective sanity. 
It was the hour of decision, he 
said. The decision would be made. 
Things were at an exact balance, 
and the balance would be tipped. 

“But we can decide. One way 
or the other, we will decide. I 
implore you all in the name of 
sanity that you decide right. One 
world or the other will be the 
world of tomorrow. One of them 
is real and one of them is a dream. 
Both are with us now, and the 
favor can go to either. But listen 



DREAMWORLD 



103 



to me here: whichever one wins, 
the other will have always been a 
dream, a momentary madness 
soon forgotten. I urge you to the 
sanity which in a measure I have 
lost myself. Yet in our darkened 
dilemma I feel that we yet have 
a choice. Choose! ” 

And perhaps that was the turn- 
ing point. 

The mad dream disappeared as 
suddenly as it had appeared. The 
world came back to normal with 
an embarrassed laugh. It was all 
over. It had lasted from its incep- 
tion six weeks. 

OASCOMB SWICEGOOD, a 
morning type, felt excellent 
this morning. He breakfasted at 
Cahill’s, and he ordered heavily 
as always. And he listened with 
half an ear to the conversation of 
two girls at the table next to his. 

“But I should know you,” he 
said. 

“Of course. I’m Teresa.” 

“I’m Agnes,” said Agnes. 

“Mr. Swicegood, how could you 
forget? It was when the dreams 
first came, and you overheard me 
telling mine to Agnes. Then you 
ran after us in the street because 
you had had the same dream, and 
I wanted to have you arrested. 
Weren’t they horrible dreams? 
And have they ever found out 
what caused them?” 

“They were horrible, and they 
have not found out. They ascribe 



it to group mania, which is mean- 
ingless. And now there are those 
who say that the dreams never 
came at all, and soon they will be 
nearly forgotten. But the horror 
of them! The loneliness!” 

“Yes, we hadn’t even pediculi to 
curry our body hair. We almost 
hadn’t any body hair.” 

Teresa was an attractive girl. 
She had a cute trick of popping 
the smallest rat out of her mouth 
so it could see what was coming 
into her stomach. She was bulbous 
and beautiful. “Like a sackful of 
skunk cabbage,” Bascomb mur- 
mured admiringly in his head, 
and then flushed green at his for- 
wardness of phrase. 

Teresa had protuberances upon 
protuberances and warts on warts, 
and hair all over her where she 
wasn’t warts and bumps. “Like a 
latrine mop!” sighed Bascomb 
with true admiration. The cracked 
clang of Teresa’s voice was music 
in the early morning. 

All was right with the earth 
again. Gone the hideous night- 
mare world when people had 
stood barefaced and lonely, with- 
out bodily friends or dependents. 
Gone that ghastly world of the 
sick blue sky and the near-ab- 
sence of entrancing odor. 

Bascomb attacked manfully his 
plate of prime carrion. And out- 
side the pungent green rain fell 
incessantly.

^T^HE day was warm, bright, sky 
-*■ blue, thermometer in the 
high sixties; a completely perfect 
October day in New York, 
needing no modification by the 
Weather Control Bureau. At the 
Weather Station in Scarsdale, 
glum-faced weather-adjustment 
men were piling into their planes 
and taking off for Wisconsin, 
where a cold front was barreling 
in from Canada, and where their 
expert services would be needed. 
Twenty thousand miles above 
Fond du Lac, the orbiting Weath- 
er Control Satellite beamed mes- 
sages down. In Australia, tech- 
nicians were completing the 
countdown on a starship about to 



blast off for a distant world with 
a cargo of one hundred reluctant 
colonists. In Chicago, where the 
morning mail had just arrived, a 
wealthy playboy stared at a blue 
slip of paper with wide-eyed hor- 
ror. In London, where the mail 
had arrived several hours before, 
a shopgirl’s face was pale with 
fear; she, too, had received her 
notice from the Colonization 
Bureau. 

Around the world, it was an 
ordinary day, the ninth of Octo- 
ber, 2116 A.D. Nothing unusual 
was happening. Nothing but the 
usual round of birth, death . .and, 
occasionally. Selection. 

And in New York, on that per-

105 



feet October day, District Chair- 
man David Mulholland of the 
Colonization Bureau reached his 
office at 0900 sharp, ready if not 
precisely eager to perform his 
routine functions. 

Before he left his office at 1400 
hours, he knew, he would have 
authorized the uprooting of one 
hundred lives. He tried not to 
think of it that way. He focused 
his mind on the slogan em- 
blazoned on blue-and-yellow 
bunting wherever you looked, the 
slogan of the Colonization Bu- 
reau Do. Your Share for Man- 
kind’s Destiny. 

But the trouble was, as Mul- 
holland could never forget, that 
mankind’s destiny was of only 
trifling interest to the vast mass 
of men. 

He entered his office, drawing 
warm smiles from the clerks and 
typists and secretaries as he 
passed their cubicles. In the 
office, everyone treated Chairman 
Mulholland with exaggerated af- 
fection. Most of the Bureau em- 
ployees were sufficiently naive to 
believe that Chairman Mulhol- 
land, if he felt so inclined, could 
arrange their exemption from the 
world-wide lottery. 

1 1 >HEY were wrong, of course. 
-■-No one who met the qualifi- 
cations was exempt. If you were 
between the ages of nineteen and 
forty, had a Health Rating of 



Plus Five or better, could pass 
a Feldman fertility test, and were 
not disqualified by one of the 
various social regulations, you 
went when you were called, in 
the name of Mankind’s Destiny. 
There was no way to wriggle off 
the hook once you were caught — 
unless, of course, you could prove 
that you were disqualified by 
some technicality that the Com- 
puter had overlooked. The re- 
maining child in a family which 
had lost four or more children to 
Selection was exempt. Mothers 
of children under two years of 
age were exempt. Even mothers 
of children under ten years of 
age were exempt, if their hus- 
bands had been Selected and if 
they had not remarried. A man 
whose wife was pregnant was en- 
titled to a single ten-month delay 
in departure. There were half a 
dozen more such technicalities. 
But, whatever the situation, sixty 
ships, six thousand people, left 
Earth every day in the week. 
Someone had to be aboard those 
ships. Somewhat more than two 
million Earthmen headed star- 
ward each year. 

Two million out of seven bil- 
lion. The chance that the dark 
finger would fall upon your 
shoulder was inconceivably re- 
mote. Even with the figure win- 
nowed down to the mere three

slight: one out of every 1800 
persons. 

Do Your Share for Mankind’s 
Destiny, said the blue-and-yellow 
sign that hung behind Chairman 
Mulholland’s desk. He looked at 
it unseeingly and sat down. Pa- 
pers had already begun to accu- 
mulate. Another day was under 
way. 

His so-efficient secretary had 
already adjusted his calendar, 
dusted his desk, tidied his papers. 
Mulholland was not fooled. Miss 
Thorne was trying to make her- 
self indispensable to the Chair- 
man, as a hedge against the 
always-to-be-dreaded day when 
the Computer’s beam lingered 
over her number. In moments of 
cruelty he thought idly of telling 
her that no mortal, not even a 
District Chairman, had enough 
pull with fate to assure an exemp- 
tion. It was entirely in the hands 
of Clotho, Lachesis and Atropos. 

Clotho put your number in the 
Computer. Lachesis riffled the 
cards. Atropos selected, and se- 
lected inflexibly. The Fates could 
not be swayed. 

Mulholland lifted the top sheet 
from the stack on his desk. It was 
the daily Requisition Form. Five 
of the sixty starships that left 
Earth each day were manned by 
Americans, and one of the five 
American ships each day was 
stocked with Selectees drawn by 
Mulholland’s office. He read the 



Requisition Form for the next 
assignment with care. 

REF. Ilab762-31, File Seven. 

10 October 2116, notices to be 
sent. 

Assignment: starship GEGEN- 
SCHEIN, blasting 17 October 
2116, from Bangor Star field. 

Required: fifty couples selected 
by Board One. 

The form differed only in detail 
from hundreds of forms that Mul- 
holland had found on his desk at 
the beginnings of hundreds of 
days past. He tried not to let him- 
self think of days past. He had 
been Chairman for three years, 
now. It was of the essence that the 
high-ranking members of a Se- 
lection Board should not them- 
selves be subject to Selection, and 
Mulholland had received his 
present job a few weeks after his 
reaching the age of forty had re- 
moved his name from the rolls of 
eligibility. 

TTE was a political appointee. 
-"■■“■According to the pollsters, his 
party was due to succumb to a 
Conservative uprising in the 
elections next month. Mulholland 
faced his party’s debacle with re- 
markably little apprehension. 
Come January, he thought. Presi- 
dent Dawson would be back in 
St. Louis practicing law, and a 
few thousand loyal Liberal party 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



107 



hacks throughout the country 
would lose their jobs, being re- 
placed by a few thousand loyal 
Conservative party hacks. 

Which meant, Mulholland 
thought, that come January some- 
one from the other side of the 
fence could sit in this chair hand- 
ing out Selection warrants, while 
David Mulholland could slip back 
into the obscurity of academic 
life and give his conscience a well- 
needed rest. It was a mere seventy 
days to the end of President Daw- 
son’s term. Mulholland shut his 
eyes tiredly. Barring a political 
upset at the polls, he would only 
have to pass sentence on seven 
thousand more human beings. 

He buzzed for his secretary. 
She came at a gallop: a bony, 
horse-faced woman of thirty who 
ran the office with formidable en- 
ergy and who never tired of quot- 
ing the Bureau slogan to visitors. 
She probably believed the gospel 
of Mankind’s Destiny implicitly, 
Mulholland thought. Which didn’t 
give her much comfort when she 
pondered the ten years that lay 
between her and freedom from 
Selection. 

“Good morning, Mr. Mulhol- 
land.” 

“Morning, Jessie. Type out an 
Authorization.” 

“Certainly, Mr. Mulholland.” 

Her agile fingers clattered over 
the machine. In a moment or 
two she placed the document on 



his desk. It was strict formality 
for him to request and for her to 
type the paper; mechanically, 
Mulholland scanned it. This had 
to go to the Computer, and any 
typing error would result in loud 
and unpleasant repercussions. 

As Chairman of the District 
One Board of Selection of the 
Colonization Bureau, I hereby 
authorize the selection of one hun- 
dred ten names from the roll of 
those eligible, on this ninth day 
of October, 21 1 6, in order to fulfil 
a departure quota of one hundred 
for the starship GEGENSCHEIN, 
blasting 17 October 2116. David 
Mulholland, Chairman District 
Board One. 

Mulholland nodded; it was in 
order. He signed it in the space 
indicated, then provided cross- 
check by pressing his thumb 
down against the photosensitive 
spot in the lower right-hand cor- 
ner. The Authorization was com- 
plete. 

He handed the form to Jessie 
Thorne, who deftly rolled it and 
stuffed it into a pneumatic tube. 
Mulholland took the tube from 
her, affixed his personal seal, and 
popped it in the open pneumotube 
vent under his desk. The little 
morning ritual was over. 

He buzzed Miss Thorne again. 
“I’ve got the cards, Jessie. Do we 
have any Volunteers today?” 



108 



GALAXY 



“One.” She gave him the card. 
Noonan, Cyril F. Age thirty, un- 
married. Mulholland read through 
the rest of the data, nodded, 
tossed Noonan’s card in a basket 
on the right side of his desk, and 
made a sharp downstroke on a 
blank tally sheet in front of him. 
Now there were only forty-nine 
men to pick for the voyage of the 
Gegenschein. Volunteers were 
rare, but they did turn up from 
time to time. 

jl/IULHOLLAND ran through 
the men first. He picked 
out his forty-nine without any 
trouble, and stacked the six left- 
over cards in his reserve basket. 
Those six names would be held 
aside until it was determined 
whether or not the other forty- 
nine were still eligible. If Mul- 
holland could fill his quota with- 
out recourse to the reserve 
basket, the six men would auto- 
matically become first on the next 
day’s Selection list. Mulholland 
had no one left over from the day 
before, as it happened; there had 
been some trouble filling the Oc- 
tober 9 quota, and he had used 
up his reserves completely yes- 
terday. 

With the men’s half at least 
tentatively finished, he skimmed 
through the fifty female names. 
Here, occasionally, the computer 
tripped up. Mulholland winnowed 
one name out immediately; Mrs. 



Mary Jensen, 31, mother of four 
children ages one to nine. She 
had as much business being in the 
list of eligibles as the President’s 
grandmother. Muholland initialed 
her card and buzzed for Miss 
Thorne again. 

“Have her name pulled from 
the list,” he ordered crisply. “She’s 
got a child born in 2115.” 

Fate had been kind to Mrs. 
Jensen. 

Mulholland prepared the rest 
of the list. Fifty men, fifty women, 
with a reserve list of six men and 
four women. In the afternoon, the 
notices would go out. They would 
be received tomorrow morning, 
and by nightfall, he knew, the 
useless appeals would come flood- 
ing in. None of the appeals ever 
reached Mulholland’s office. They 
were screened off by underlings, 
who were trained in the art of 
giving gentle Nos. Mulholland 
himself had held such a job until 
getting his promotion to the top. 

He looked down the list he 
had compiled. A college student 
from Cincinnati, an office worker 
in San Francisco, a lawyer from 
Los Angeles. A girl who gave her 
occupation as “entertainer,” from 
New York. 

It was a cross-section'. Mulhol- 
land privately felt that this was 
a flaw in the Selection system, 
because very often a group was 
sent out without a medical man, 
without any kind of religious 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



109 



counsellor, without any expert 
engineer or scientist. But there 
was no helping it. For one thing, 
it would be grossly unfair to see 
to it that the Computer picked 
one doctor for each hundred colo- 
nists. Generally it worked out that 
way, but not always. 

It was a sink-or-swim proposi- 
tion. Millions upon millions of 
stars waited in the infinite heav- 
ens. The stellar colonization was a 
far-sighted enterprise, and, like 
most far-sighted enterprises, was 
cruel in the short run. But, cen- 
turies hence, a far-flung galaxy 
would shine with the worlds of 
man. It was the only way. Even 
though the ships existed to take 
man to the stars, only a handful 
of people would consider uproot- 
ing themselves to go out into the 
dark. If the colonization of the 
stars had been left on a volunteer 
basis, barely a dozen worlds 
would be settled now, instead of 
the thousands that already bore 
man’s imprint. They were small 
colonies, to be sure; but they 
grew. Only a handful out of the 
thousands had failed to take root. 

And, thought Mulholland, a 
week from tomorrow the starship 
Gegenschein would take ninety- 
nine conscripts and a lone Volun- 
teer to the stars. He looked 
through his cards. Herrick, Carol. 
Dawes, Michael. Haas, Philip. 
Matthews, David. And eight 
dozen others. Tonight they 



laughed, played, sang, made love. 
Tomorrow they would no longer 
belong to Earth. The inflexible 
sword of Colonization would cut 
them loose. 

Mulholland shrugged. He was 
making his old mistake, thinking 
of the conscripts as people in- 
stead of as names on green cards. 
That way lay crackup. He had 
to remember that he was only 
doing a job, that if he didn’t take 
care of it someone else would. 
And it was for Mankind’s Destiny. 

But he was weary of wielding 
the sword. It was less than a 
month till Election Day, and he 
prayed devoutly that his party 
would be turned out of office. It 
was no way for a loyal party hack 
to be thinking, but Mulholland 
didn’t care. It would be an ad- 
mission of weakness to resign. An 
electoral defeat would get him 
out of the job much more grace- 
fully. 

II 

I ^HERE had been rain over 
Ohio during the night. For 
once, it had been natural rain. The 
Weather Control people engi- 
neered the weather with great 
care during the summer, when 
thirsty fields cried out for rain, 
and in the winter, when un- 
checked snow might throttle civi- 
lization. But in October the fields 
lay empty. There was no need for 



no 



GALAXY 



artificial rain. The rain that fell 
in the early hours of morning over 
Central Ohio was God’s rain, not 
man’s, sent by the cold front 
sweeping southward out of Can- 
ada. 

In his furnished room just off 
11th Avenue, not very far from 
the University, Mike Dawes 
pulled the covers up over his 
head, retreating symbolically to 
the womb in hope of finding 
warmth and security. But it was 
no good. He was half awake, 
awake enough to realize he was 
awake, but still too drowsy to 
want to get out of bed. He could 
hear the pattering of the rain. It 
was a dark morning. 

The lumo-dial of his clock read 
0800 hours. He knew it was time 
to get out of bed. This was Wed- 
nesday, his busiest day of the 
academic week. At 0900 there 
was old Shepperd’s Zoology lec- 
ture, and German at 1000 hours. 
And I forgot to review those 
verbs, Mike Dawes thought in ir- 
ritation. If Klaus calls on me, I’m 
sunk. 

He thought about getting out of 
bed for a few minutes; finally, he 
rationed himself to sixty more 
seconds of warmth. Counting off 
a-thousand-one, a-thousand-two, 
he sprang out of bed faithfully on 
the count of a-thousand-sixty, and 
shivered in the bleak morning 
coldness. 

Routine took hold of him. He 
THE SEED OF EARTH 



stripped off his pajamas and 
tossed them onto the bed; he 
groped for a towel and his robe, 
found them, and made his way 
down the hall to the shower. He 
spent three minutes under the 
cold spray. When he returned to 
his room, the clock said 0813 
hours. Dawes smiled. He was right 
on schedule. If only he hadn’t 
forgotten about those verbs! But 
it was too late to fret about that. 
He’d have to hope for the best. 

It looked as though this semes- 
ter was going to be one long 
dreary grind, he thought as he 
pulled clothes from the rickety 
old dresser and started to climb 
into them. He was twenty; this 
was his third year at Ohio State. 
If all went well, he would gradu- 
ate the following year and move 
on to medical school for four 
years. 

If all went well. 

At 0821 hours he was ready to 
leave: teeth brushed, hair combed, 
shirt buttoned, shoelaces tied. The 
books he would need for his morn- 
ing classes were waiting on the 
edge of the dresser. He would 
have time for some orange juice, 
toast, and coffee at the Student’s 
Union. The probability of a sur- 
prise Zoo quiz was too great to 
allow for skipping breakfast; he 
needed all the energy he could 
muster. He was skinny, in the 
first place, stretching 150 pounds 
out for six feet and an inch. In 

in 



the second place, he liked to have 
breakfast. 

Dawes started downstairs. It 
was still raining slightly, but not 
hard enough to be troublesome. 
Anyway, it was only a four-block 
walk from the rooming house 
where he lived to the Union. 

First, though, came one morn- 
ing ritual. He stopped downstairs 
in the hallway, where the mail- 
boxes were. His hand quivered a 
little as he pressed his thumb 
against the opener-plate. The 
scanner recorded his print and 
obediently opened the mailbox. 
He took out the letter. 

TT WAS a blue envelope, longer 
than usual, with an official 
penalty-for-private-use imprint 
where the stamp was supposed to 
be. Dawes’ eyes travelled over 
the return address almost casu- 
ally. Colonization Bureau, Dis- 
trict Board Number One, New 
Y ork. 

His stomach felt queasy as he 
ripped the envelope hastily open. 

It was addressed to him, all 
right. The letter, typed neatly in 
dark red on the standard blue 
paper, came quickly to the point. 

You have been selected to be 
a member of the colonizing expe- 
dition departing on 17 October 
from Bangor, Maine, aboard the 
starship GEGENSCHEIN. You 
must report at once to your near- 



est Colonization Bureau registry 
center. You are now subject to the 
provisions of the Interstellar Col- 
onization Act of 2099, and any 
violation of these provisions wilt 
meet with severe punishment. 

By order of D. L. Mulholland, 
District Chairman. 

Mike Dawes read the contents 
of the slip of blue paper four 
times, one after another, and with 
each reading the numbness grew 
in him. He was finding it hard to 
believe that he had really been 
called. After all, the chance was 
one in thousands, he thought. 
Why, in all his life he had only 
known two or three people to be 
called. There had been Mr. Cut- 
ley, who ran the grocery store, 
and Teddy Nathan, who lived on 
the next block. And Judy Welling- 
ton also, Dawes thought. 

And now me. 

“Dammit, it isn’t fair!” he mut- 
tered. 

“What isn’t?” a casual voice 
asked behind him. 

Dawes turned. He saw Lon Ry- 
beck there — a senior who lived 
on the first floor. Rybeck still 
wore a dressing gown; he had no 
early classes, but came out to 
look at the mail anyway. 

Mutely Dawes held up the blue 
slip. Rybeck’s eyes narrowed and 
his tongue flicked briefly across 
his lips. “They picked you?” he 
asked hoarsely. 



112 



GALAXY 



Dawes nodded. “It just came. 
I have to report to the nearest 
registry center right away.” 

“That’s a lousy break, Dawes!” 

“Damn right it is! Why’d they 
have to grab me? I’m only twenty! 
I haven’t even finished college! 
I — ” 

He quit, realizing that he 
sounded foolish. Rybeck was try- 
ing to look sympathetic, but be- 
hind the expression of concern 
was a deeper amusement — and 
relief. Probability dictated that 
the invisible hand would not 
reach into this house a second 
time; Dawes’ Selection meant Ry- 
beck could breathe more freely. 

“It’s rough,” Rybeck said gent- 
ly. “The morning mail comes and 
all your plans explode like bub- 
bles. Where are they sending you, 
do you know?” 

Dawes shook his head. “It just 
says I’ll be leaving next Wednes- 
day from the Bangor starfield. 
Doesn’t give the destination.” 

^ I TWENTY years ago, they had 
decided that mankind’s des- 
tiny was in the stars. Mike Dawes 
had been a gurgling baby when 
the decision was made that, twen- 
ty years hence, would rip him 
from the fabric of existence on 
Earth. Get out to the stars, that 
was the cry that swept newly- 
united Earth. Settle other worlds. 
Spread Earthmen through the 
universe. It had been a noble aim. 



Dawes thought. Except that no- 
body seemed very anxious to go. 
Let the other guy colonize the 
stars. Me, I’ll stay here and read 
about it. 

So there was a conscription. 
And now, Dawes thought, I’ve 
been caught. 

.... report at once to your 
nearest Colonization Bureau reg- 
istry center .... 

When they said “at once,” they 
meant it, Dawes knew. They 
meant get there within the hour. 
And woe betide if they discovered 
he had done anything to himself 
to make himself ineligible. There 
had been cases of women slashing 
at their ovaries with knitting- 
needles to disqualify themselves; 
naturally, only fertile colonists 
were wanted. But the penalty for 
intentional self-sterilization was 
a lifetime at hard labor. It wasn’t 
worth it. 

Twice he reached for the 
phone, to call his parents in Cin- 
cinnati and let them know. Twice, 
he drew back. They would have 
to be told sooner or later, he knew. 
But he steered away from bring- 
ing the bad news himself. Then he 
pictured how it would be if he 
remained silent and let the Bu- 
reau send them its official notice. 
He picked up the phone again. 

His father answered. Mike felt 
a pang of regret as he heard the 
voice of his father, the newsstand 
proprietor who had scraped for 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



113 



years so his favorite boy could 
study to be a doctor. 

“Yes? Who is this?” 

“Dad, this is Mike.” 

“Is everything all right?” said 
the immediately suspicious voice. 
“You got our letter? You didn’t 
run out of money so soon, did 
you?” 

“No, Dad. I — they’ve — ” 
“Speak up, Mike. We must 
have a bad connection. I can hard- 
ly hear you.” 

“I’ve been Selected, Dad!” 

' I ■'HERE was a pause, a sharp 
indrawing of breath. Dawes 
heard indistinct muttering; no 
doubt his father had his hand 
over the mouthpiece and was tell- 
ing his mother about it. Dawes 
was grateful, for the first time, 
that he had never been able to 
afford a visual attachment for the 
phone. Right now he did not want 
to see their faces. 

“When did you get the notice, 
boy?” 

“J-just now. I have to report 
to the registry center right away. 
I leave next Wednesday.” 

“Next Wednesday,” his father 
repeated musingly. 

Dawes heard his mother sob- 
bing in the background. She cried 
out suddenly, “We won’t let them 
take him! We won’t!” 

“There’s no helping it, Ethel,” 
said his father quietly. “Boy, can 
you hear me?” 



“Yes, Dad.” 

“Report where you’re supposed 
to. Don’t do anything wrong, do 
you hear?” 

“I won’t. Dad.” 

“Will we see you again?” 

“I — I suppose so. At least they 
ought to let us say goodbye.” 
“And there isn’t any way you 
can get out of this? I mean, once 
they call you, you can’t appeal?” 
“No, Dad. Nobody can appeal.” 
“Oh. I see.” 

There was another long pause. 
Dawes waited, not knowing what 
to say. He felt strangely guilty, as 
if he were at fault somehow for 
having brought this sorrow upon 
his parents. 

His father said finally, “So long, 
boy. Take care of yourself. And 
let us know, soon as you know 
anything about where you’re go- 
ing.” 

“Sure, Dad. Tell Mom not to 
worry. So long.” 

He hung up the phone. After a 
moment, he walked to the win- 
dow. The rain had stopped; it 
was nearly nine, and the slackers 
were hustling to get to classes on 
time. Out there on campus, life 
was going on as usual. The foot- 
ball coach was sweating out tac- 
tics for Saturday’s game, Shep- 
perd was clearing his throat and 
stepping forward to deliver his 
Zoology lecture, Klaus was be- 
laboring hapless freshmen over 
irregular German verbs. Life went 



114 



GALAXY 



on. The world revolved serenely 
around the sun. But, a week from 
now, Mike Dawes would be no 
longer part of this world. 

He felt a quiet, seething anger 
at the injustice of it. He hadn’t 
asked to be part of Mankind’s 
Destiny. He had no itch to con- 
quer other worlds. He wanted to 
stay on Earth, marry some reason- 
ably pretty Ohio girl, raise some 
reasonably normal Ohio children. 

%1^ELL, that dream was over. 

There was nothing left for 
him to do now but to walk down 
to the registry center and hand 
himself in, like a wanted criminal. 

He locked his room, wondering 
if he would ever come back here 
to collect his few belongings, and 
trotted downstairs and into the 
street. It seemed to him that 
everyone on the street turned to 
look at him, as if they could see 
the words written in scarlet on 
his forehead: MIKE DAWES 
HAS BEEN SELECTED. 

The registry center was in a 
loft over the movie theater. Only 
four days ago he had taken a girl 
to a movie there. They had cud- 
dled in the balcony, ignoring the 
film on the tridim screen, and he 
had groped haphazardly for 
tempting areas of her body and 
wondered about those aspects of 
life that were still mysteries to 
him. 

When you were Selected, he 



thought, you also get a wife. They 
send out fifty men, fifty women. 
If you happen to be married al- 
ready but have no children, you 
can accompany your spouse as a 
Volunteer. If you’re married and 
do have children, and your mate 
is Selected, you stay behind to 
take care of the children. Unless 
you and your wife go to space 
together, you are given one of 
the other colonists as a mate, and 
any Earthside relationship you 
may have had was considered 
terminated. So he would be mar- 
ried soon — to someone. 

He took the stairs leading to 
the registry center two at a time. 
A few boys were waiting on a 
bench along the wall; they peered 
curiously at him as he came in. 
They had just turned nineteen, 
and were waiting to register. 

Dawes had registered here just 
a year ago. Everyone had to reg- 
ister at the age of nineteen; if you 
failed to register, you were auto- 
matically Selected. So he had 
come in and filled out the forms, 
and they had put him through the 
diagnosing machines and then 
given him the quick and efficient 
and somewhat embarrassing fer- 
tility test. And, a few weeks later, 
he had received a card telling him 
that he had passed. He had 
shrugged and put the card in his 
wallet, thinking that Selection 
was something that happened to 
other people. 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



115 



But it had happened to him. 
Now. 

He put his blue slip down on 
the reception desk and the clerk 
looked at it, nodding. Behind him, 
Dawes heard the waiting boys 
muttering. As a Selectee, he had 
a certain new notoriety. 

“Come this way, please,” she 
said solemnly to him, giving him 
a you-are-doing-your-share-for- 
mankind’s-destiny look. She led 
him into an inner office, where a 
tall, balding man in his late forties 
sat initialing some papers. 

“Mr. Brewer, this is Michael 
Dawes, who was Selected by the 
New York board today.” 

Brewer rose and extended a 
hand. “Congratulations, Dawes. 
Maybe you can’t see it right now, 
but you’re about to take part in 
mankind’s greatest adventure. 
Thank you. Miss Donaldson.” 

lY/flSS Donaldson left. Brewer 
sat down again, gesturing 
Dawes toward a comfortable 
pneumochair. 

“Well?” Brewer asked. “You’re 
sore as hell, aren’t you?” 

“Am I supposed to be happy?” 
Brewer shrugged. “If you 
wanted to go to the stars, you’d 
have volunteered. It’s a rough 
break, youngster. How old are 
you?” 

“Twenty.” 

“You’re still young enough to 
adjust. Some mornings I have 



men in their thirties come in, men 
with families. You’d be surprised 
how many of them want to blow 
me up. You aren’t married, are 
you?” 

“No, sir.” 

“Parents?” 

“They live in Cincinnati. I’ve 
phoned them already.” 

“You don’t figure you have any 
grounds for disqualification, then.” 
Dawes shook his head. In a 
quiet voice he said, “I can’t get 
out of it. I’m resigned to going. 
But that isn’t going to make me 
like it.” 

“We assume that,” Brewer said. 
“But we also assume that you 
won’t spend all your time sulking 
when you ought to be colonizing. 
You don’t sulk for long on an 
alien world and stay alive.” He 
shook his head. “If you think 
you’ve got troubles, think about 
the last man Selected in this dis- 
trict. Father of three children. Age 
thirty-nine years, eleven months, 
three weeks. One week to go and 
he’d be ineligible, but the Com- 
puter picked him. He said it was 
a frame-up. But he went, he did.” 
“Is that supposed to make me 
feel better?” Dawes asked. 

“I don’t know,” said Brewer, 
sighing. “They tell me misery 
loves company. You probably feel 
awfully sorry for yourself, and I 
don’t blame you.” 

“Will I be allowed to see my 
parents again?”

“You can fly to Cincy this af- 
ternoon, if you like. For the next 
week you’ll be accompanied by a 
Bureau guard. As a precaution, 
you understand. Naturally, he’ll 
give you as much privacy as you 
want — in case there may be a 
young lady you would like to pay 
a farewell visit to, or — ” 

“Just my parents,” Dawes said. 
“All right. Whatever. You have 
seven days. Make the most of 
them. You’ll get a full physical 
next door right now. Maybe 
you’re no longer eligible.” 

“Small chance of that!” 

“We can always hope, eh, 
Mike?” 

“Why do that? What do you 
care whether I go or not? Do you 
know what it’s like to be ripped 
up and tossed out into space? 
You’re over age; you’re safe.” 
Brewer smiled sadly. “I don’t 
have a good heart; I never was 
eligible. But that doesn’t mean I 
don’t know what you’re going 
through now. My wife was Se- 
lected ten years ago. Come with 
me, Mike. The doctor will have 
a look at you.”

^HERRY Thomas came awake 
all at once. In automatic 
need she reached out to her left, 
but the place next to her in bed 
was empty, still faintly warm; 
Charlie was gone. She could see 



a crisp ten-dollar bill wedged into 
the corner of her mirror. 

Rising, she unhooked the bill 
and slipped it into her dresser 
drawer. The apartment was a 
mess. Two empty bottles sat on 
the floor near the bed; cigarette 
ashes were sprinkled everywhere. 
Charlie had brought last night’s 
newspaper in with him, probably 
to study the racing news, and now 
the pages were scattered all over 
the place. Well, it had been a 
pleasant night. Thank goodness 
for small blessings. In these tough 
times, it was good to know that 
somebody enjoyed your company. 
Cherry thought. 

She lugged the Cleanall out of 
the closet, plugged it in, and set 
it to work gobbling up the scat- 
tered ashes while she herself 
showered. The gentle cleansing 
spray felt good as it peeled away 
the night’s grime. After ten min- 
utes under the water she stepped 
out, stretched, yawned, did her 
calisthenics. Musn’t let the mid- 
dle start to sag, dearie. You’re 
only as good as your body is. 

Morning duties over. Cherry 
flipped the switch on the radio; 
music streamed into the apart- 
ment. She jabbed down on the 
window-opaquer and the polarity 
of the glass shifted, letting in the 
morning sunlight. It looked as if 
New York would have another 
perfect day. The wall clock said 
1123 hours, 10 October 2116. 



THE SEED OF EARTH

She knew there wasn’t much 
time. At 1300 she was due down- 
town for an audition; one of the 
big sensie-theaters needed usher- 
ettes. It was cheap work for a 
girl who had once stripped in the 
best establishments of three conti- 
nents, but time moved along; she 
was thirty-three, no longer in the 
first golden bloom of youth, and 
these days the strip managers 
seemed to have a cradle-fetish: 
the younger the better. Next year. 
Cherry thought sourly, somebody 
would come up with the ultimate 
in that line — the ten-year-old 
stripper. 

She punched out breakfast on 
the autocook. Cherry’s apartment 
was automatic in almost every 
respect. She had always dreamed 
of living surrounded by the latest 
gadgets, and, one year when she’d 
really been taking in the cash, she 
had bought herself all the gadgets 
there were. An automatic back- 
scratcher that came out of the 
bed’s headboard when she wanted 
it; an autocook; automatically 
opaquing windows; light-dim- 
mers; a Cleanall. Her apartment 
was a nest for electronic wizardry 
of all kinds. In these latter days, 
when to fill out a skimpy income 
she had taken to bringing men up 
for an evening, there were plenty 
of wise remarks about the wealth 
of gadgetry in the place. It got 
so she could practically anticipate 
the gags. 



^HERRY ate without interest. 

Breakfast was just some- 
thing that had to be eaten, not 
any source of- pleasure. She was 
tense about the audition at 1300. 
An usherette had to prance up 
and down the aisles in nothing 
more than a bit of hip-length 
translucent fluff. She was suie 
she still had the figure for the 
job, but her confidence was low. 
In the past year she had been 
gaining weight, slowly, inexorably, 
unstoppably. 

It wasn’t like this when Dan 
was here, she thought. 

Dan had been the world to her: 
manager, trainer, coach, father- 
confessor, agent. Dan had found 
her when she was a pickup girl 
in Philadelphia, and before Dan 
had finished with her she was the 
toast of Las Vegas, Paris, Bucha- 
rest. Dan had slimmed her down, 
taught her poise, forced her to 
fight the temptations of food and 
sex, found her the best jobs and 
compelled her to turn down 
everything but the very best. 

But Dan was gone. They had 
Selected him, four years ago. And 
nothing had been the same since. 

And the worst of it was. Cherry 
thought, rubbing the old wound 
with salt for the millionth time, 
that she could have gone with 
him, if she had wanted to. “You 
can always become a Volunteer,” 
Dan had told her as she wept 
hysterically that morning. “You 



118 



GALAXY 



can come with me wherever I’m 
going, if it means that much to 
you.” And he had knotted his 
hands in his thick dark hair and 
waited for her answer, and she 
had refused to say anything. 

Well, what the hell would YOU 
do? she demanded fiercely of no- 
body in particular. She had been 
twenty-nine, rolling in money, the 
toast of the entertainment world. 
He was ten years older than she. 
Sure, she had thought she loved 
him, but how can anyone be sure 
of that? It seemed like so much 
to ask, for her to give up her 
limousine and her apartment and 
her pet ocelot and her cozy, lux- 
urious, pampered life to follow 
him out to the stars. 

So she had finally said No, she 
would stay here, and Dan had 
shrugged calmly, telling her that 
it was better that way, that she 
was probably not fitted for the 
rugged frontier life anyway. And 
he had gone, leaving her behind. 
And then the anguish began for 
her in earnest. 

She had sold the fancy cars and 
given away the ocelot; she still 
had the apartment, but very little 
else. She had lost her cozy, lux- 
urious life, and she had lost Dan. 
There had been the quick, crazy, 
bad marriage the year after Dan 
was taken, a marriage that lasted 
only a couple of months, and after 
that the long, slow, gentle slide 
downward. The slide hadn’t 



ended yet. Every morning she 
realized that more clearly. 

But I was selfish. I stayed be- 
hind. And what did I get for it? 

^HERRY shook her head sadly, 
put her coffee cup into the 
autowash, and took a Cheeriup 
pill from the medicine cabinet. 
The pill took effect practically at 
once: a fine, false buoyant feeling 
of optimism and good cheer re- 
placed the introspective mood of 
gloom. She punched the dial three 
more times and three more little 
yellow pills popped out. One 
every four hours would see her 
through the day without a mo- 
ment of depression; maybe the 
good mood was phony, but it was 
better than brooding about Dan 
all day. 

One last check in the mirror: 
makeup was okay, hair well 
-groomed, face scrubbed. Thanks 
to the Cheeriup, she looked hap- 
py, enthusiastic, eager. The audi- 
tioners would never be able to 
see the core of misery deep be- 
neath the surface. 

“Good morning. Miss Thomas,” 
said the elevator’s voice as she 
stepped in. A photoscanner in the 
elevator’s roof was rigged to rec- 
ognize all of the building’s tenants 
and give them a personal greet- 
ing. 

“Good morning,” she said. “Nice 
day.” 

There was no reply. The ele- 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



119 



vator’s brain-center was pro- 
grammed only for one sentence. 
But she believed in returning the 
greeting, anyway. It was the least 
she could do. 

The elevator deposited her in 
the glittering chrome-and-green- 
glass lobby. She started to break 
the photobeam that controlled the 
front door; then, as an after- 
thought, she decided to see if 
there had been any mail for her. 

That was when she found the 
Selection notice from the Coloni- 
zation Bureau. 

Her Mirror-bright fingernails 
slashed the blue envelope open. 
She read the message carefully, 
slowly; reading had never been 
one of her strong points. When 
she had gone through the brief 
notice the first time, she doubled 
back and read it again. 

Yes; no doubt of it. It was a 
Selection notice. 

“Well, I’ll be a — So they got 
me too!” 

You have been selected to be 
a member of the colonizing expe- 
dition departing on 17 October 
from Bangor, Maine, aboard the 
starship GEGENSCHEIN. You 
must report at once to your near- 
est Colonization Bureau registry 
center. You are now subject to 
the provisions of the Interstellar 
Colonization Act of 2099, and any 
violation of these provisions will 
meet with severe punishment. 



By order of D. L. Mulholland, 
District Chairman. 

Her first reaction was an out- 
raged one: Who the hell are they 
that they can grab hold of Cherry 
Thomas and say that she has to 
go out and go to the stars? They 
can’t push me around like that! 

But after the first wild flare of 
defiance came a quieter, more so- 
bering thought: Maybe it won’t 
be so bad. I could use a change 
of air. I’m not going anyplace here 
on Earth. In ten years I’ll be a 
two-bit floozie. So why not go 
where they want me to go? 

And then came the last thought, 
the clincher: Maybe you can pick 
the place where you’re going! 
Maybe I can find Dan! 

She hurried upstairs. According 
to the notice, she had to report to 
the nearest registry center at 
once. The phone directory told 
her that there was a center ten 
blocks away. To blazes with that 
audition! For the first time in 
years she felt genuine enthusiasm. 

CHE took a cab to the registry 
^ center — no need to worry 
about economizing now. She prac- 
tically ran up the stairs and into 
the big office. A receptionist 
blinked at her and Cherry shoved 
the blue slip forward. 

“Here. I just got this. I’ve been 
Selected. Where do I go?” 

“I’ll take you to the Director.” 



120 



GALAXY 



The Director was a blank-faced 
man in his fifties who turned on a 
smile when Cherry entered. She 
said at once, “I’m Cherry Thomas. 
I just got Selected.” 

“Won’t you have a seat? I’m 
Mr. Stewart. I realize this day is 
an unhappy one for you, but may 
I assure you — ” 

She cut him off. “Look, Mr. 
Stewart, I want you to do me 
a favor. I don’t mind getting Se- 
lected, I suppose. But I want you 
to send me to the same planet 
where they sent Dan Cirillo in 
2112. I don’t know the name of 
the planet, but you ought to be 
able to look it up somewhere for 
me, and — ” 

Mr. Stewart’s blank moon-face 
was furrowed by a frown. “You 
don’t seem to understand. Miss 
Thomas. You’re not being sent to 
a planet that’s already been colo- 
nized. You’ll be going to a com- 
pletely untamed world, a virgin 
planet.” 

“But I want to be near Dan! 
Listen, he was everything to me, 
we were practically getting mar- 
ried, and then you came along and 
Selected him. So he went out 
there. Well, now it’s my turn, and 
I want to go to him! Can’t you see 
how important it is? Damn it, 
don’t you have any heart?” 

Mr. Stewart shrugged gently. 
“I’m afraid it’s utterly impossible 
for you to follow him now. For 
one thing, don’t you see that he’s 



been married up there for four 
years?” 

“Dan — married?” Cherry 
shook her head. Stupid of me not 
to think of that! Of course, when 
they sent you up there you had 
to be coupled off! Slowly her 
fluttering nervous system calmed. 
“I — hadn’t figured on that,” she 
said in a soft voice. “Sure. He got 
married up there.” She felt a lump 
sprouting at the base of her 
throat. 

Mr. Stewart leaned forward, 
smiling now. “So you see, we 
couldn’t send you to him. Not 
now.” 

“But I could have gone four 
years ago! All I had to do was 
come here and say the word, and 
you would have sent me! And I’d 
be up there with him now! I’d be 
bis wife!” Her voice reached a 
pitch of near hysteria. She burst 
into sudden tears and put her 
head in her hands. 

The peak of emotion passed in 
a moment or two. When she 
looked up, she saw Mr. Stewart 
watching her calmly, as if he went 
through this sort of thing every 
day. 

“So I’m going to some other 
planet?” she asked quietly. 
“Which one?” 

“Only the higher authorities 
know that. Miss Thomas. Does 
it really matter?” 

“No — no, I suppose it doesn’t.” 

He fussed uncomfortably with 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



121 



papers on his desk. “I’ve sent for 
your records, but it’ll take a little 
while. You didn’t register at this 
office.” 

“I registered in Philadelphia,” 
she said. “Fourteen years ago.” It 
seemed like an eternity. And now, 
at last, her number had come up. 
In her mind’s eye she pictured the 
Cherry Thomas of 2104, timidly 
filling out the registry form. Just 
a scared kid of nineteen, then. A 
lot had happened in fourteen 
years. 

Mr. Stewart said, “I take it 
you’re not currently married. Miss 
Thomas?” 

iiivro. I was — three years ago. 

Not now.” 

“I see. And — and there isn’t 
anyone who might possibly care 
to volunteer to accompany you?” 
Cherry thought down the list 
of the men she knew. No, none 
of them had the stuff of a Volun- 
teer in them. She shook her head 
silently. 

“May I ask your profession?” 
Mr. Stewart said. 

“I’m — an entertainer.” 

Mr. Stewart moistened his thin, 
pale lips. “Do you plan to appeal 
your Selection?” 

“What good would that do?” 
“With your psychological back- 
ground, you might stand a chance 
of getting out.” 

“What does that mean?” 

“If you can prove a history of 



nymphomania, say.” Mr. Stewart 
reddened uncomfortably. “It isn’t 
generally known, but compulsive 
promiscuity can get you disquali- 
fied from eligibility. You can see 
that an uncontrolled woman 
could do great harm in the small 
community that an interstellar 
colony is at the beginning.” 

Cherry peered at him gravely. 
“You mean I could get turned 
down because I like — because 
I was — ” 

“It’s a possibility, I say. The 
ideal colonial woman is one who 
can adjust to marriage, take what- 
ever man she happens to be 
mated with and live with him 
happily, raising as many children 
as her constitution can manage. 
Do you think you’re psychologic- 
ally suited for that sort of life?” 

Cherry frowned uncertainly. 
Once, so far back she had trouble 
remembering it, she had been like 
other girls, wanting a home, a 
man, children. Somewhere along 
the way those desires had got 
lost in the shuffle. 

She smiled ironically. Ever 
since they had taken Dan away, 
she had started every day by 
cursing Selection and the men 
who ran it. But now that she her- 
self was meshed in the net, she 
saw that Selection was the thing 
she had waited for without know- 
ing. It offered escape — escape 
from the harsh tinsel world she 
lived in, escape from the jeering 



122 



GALAXY 



men who grudgingly paid her 
price now and who in a few years 
would bargain and haggle with 
her, escape from the enclosing 
wall of loneliness and fear. 

A new world; a husband; 
children. 

Her eyes felt misty with un- 
accustomed moisture. “Look,” she 
said. “I ain’t appealing. You see 
they don’t turn me down, hear?” 

IV 

I3EOPLE generally stepped to 
one side when they saw Ky 
Noonan coming toward them 
down the street. It was not only 
on account of his size; there are 
big men whose very size serves 
only to emphasize their essential 
innocuousness. But about Noonan 
there was that intangible air of 
authority, of quiet self-confidence, 
that silently admonished other 
people: Better watch out and get 
out of my way. Ky Noonan is 
coming through! 

At thirty, he was just ripening 
into his physical prime. He was 
flamboyantly big, six feet four, 
a two hundred pounder who car- 
ried no fat. His jet-black hair 
swept backward in an untamed 
but somehow orderly mass that 
added seeming inches to his al- 
ready impressive height. He had 
a voice to match his height, a 
heavy growling rumble that could 
be heard blocks away when he 



troubled to project it. His shoul- 
ders were broad, his legs long 
and sturdy, his skin tanned until 
it looked like fine cordovan or ex- 
pensive morocco leather. 

He had come to an important 
decision today. The decision had 
been a couple of years in the bud, 
years that he had spent hauling 
freight in Jamaica and policing 
the troubled frontier of South 
Africa. His police term had ex- 
pired more than a month ago, and 
he had not put in an application 
for re-enlistment. He was restless 
on Earth. He had matured early, 
left an unmourned home at four- 
teen, held a hundred jobs in 
twenty countries since then. 

Earth hemmed him in. The 
prison of the blue sky irked him. 
He wanted to leave. 

They had let him have a tour 
of duty under the Venus dome in 
2111 , but that was not what he 
wanted, either. No place in the 
Solar System suited him. In the 
System, a man either lived on 
Earth or he lived under a dome. 
Venus, Mars, Ganymede, Callisto, 
Titan, Pluto — six human settle- 
ments, plus one on Luna. But man 
was bound there, bound by the 
glimmering wall of duroplast that 
held away the encroaching poison • 
from outside. He had spent his 
year on Venus gloweringly per- 
forming routine activities under 
the dome, while staring with un- 
disguised anger at the red and 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



123 



green and blue and violet world 
outside, the world of formalde- 
hyde and foul gases and weird 
waxen plants, the world where no 
man dared go without a breath- 
ing-suit and full shielding. 

He did not need to visit the 
other Solar System settlements to 
know that it would be the same. 
On Mars you looked out on dead 
red desert; on Ganymede you 
squinted past eye-searing white 
fields of snow to the giant unap- 
proachable glory of Jupiter swell- 
ing in the sky. What good was it 
if, bound as you were to the need 
for oxygen and water, you left 
Earth only to be penned beneath 
a plastic dome? 

No. The only world of the Solar 
System that allowed a man to 
range freely over its surface un- 
encumbered by apparatus for sur- 
vival was Earth, and Earth no 
longer held any fascination for Ky 
Noonan. He longed for the stars. 

T IKE everyone else, he regis- 
tered for Selection when he 
turned nineteen. At nineteen he 
was belligerent, bellicose, loudly 
warning the terrified technicians 
that they had better find him in- 
eligible for Selection, or else. But 
they had ignored his threats and 
passed him as being fit and fertile, 
and for a day or two he had 
stormed and raged at the intol- 
erable invasion of his private 
rights that Selection constituted. 



And now he stood on a dingy, 
deteriorated street in Old Balti- 
more on a mild October after- 
noon, outside an office on whose 
door was inscribed in golden 
letters, COLONIZATION BU- 
REAU, DISTRICT ONE, LO- 
CAL BOARD OF REGISTRY 
#212. A few simple words and 
he would place his private rights 
forever out of his own reach. 

At the moment of decision he 
hung back, an act not character- 
istic of him. But he hesitated only 
a handful of moments. He had 
come this far; he realized that 
there could be no turning back 
now. 

The office door was the old- 
fashioned kind, manually oper- 
ated. He grasped the handle and 
pulled it open. He stepped inside. 

A dozen teenagers, boys and 
girls, stood at a table to the left 
of the door, frowning busily over 
the registry questionnaire. To the 
right, several others stood on line, 
waiting to be admitted to the 
medical office for their physical 
examinations. All of them looked 
scared. Noonan smiled inwardly, 
knowing that by his action today 
he was permitting some fright- 
ened, reluctant little person to 
spend twenty-four extra hours on 
Earth. 

He strode to the reception desk 
and said, clearly, so that every- 
one in the room could hear him, 
“My name is Noonan. I want to 



124 



GALAXY 



volunteer for Selection — the 
sooner the better.” 

A dozen heads swivelled round 
to peer at him. There was a si- 
lence in the room. The reception- 
ist muttered something automatic 
and conducted him inside, to an 
office whose door bore the label 
Mr. Harness. 

Mr. Harness was a timorous- 
looking, clerkish, dried-out little 
man with a pretentiously solemn 
manner. He offered Noonan a 
chair and said, “Do I understand 
that you wish to volunteer for 
Selection?” 

“You understand right.” 

Mr. Harness steepled his fingers 
in a thoughtful way. “We don’t 
get many Volunteers these days, 
as you can imagine. You’re the 
first in more than a month.” 

Noonan shrugged. “Do I get a 
medal?” 

Mr. Harness looked uncomfort- 
able. “Not exactly. But you do 
get certain privileges that the or- 
dinary conscripts won’t be en- 
titled to. You’re aware of that, 
aren’t you?” 

“I know that Volunteers get 
their first pick of the women,” 
Noonan said bluntly. “Maybe 
they get better food on the star- 
ship going out, too. But the 
women angle is the only privilege 
I’m interested in.” 

“Ah — yes. Of course, Mr. — 
Mr. — ” 

“Noonan. Ky Noonan.” 



t|''HE Bureau man reached for 
a data blank and a pen. “We 
might as well get the details down, 
Mr. Noonan. Would you spell 
that first name, please?” 

Noonan’s lips twitched with 
sudden annoyance. “Cyril. C-Y- 
R-I-L. Cyril Franklin Noonan. I 
call myself Ky.” The effete first 
name had been his mother’s idea; 
he detested it, but all his official 
records bore that name, and he 
was too proud a man to apply for 
an authorized legal name-change. 
He called himself Ky, and let it 
go at that. 

“Date of birth?” 

“4 January 2086.” 

“Making you — ah — • thirty. 
Your occupation, please?” 

“Most recently, I was a police- 
man. A lot of other things before 
that.” 

“Any special training? Medi- 
cine, the law, science, engineer- 
ing?” 

“I know how to use these — ” 
Noonan held out his big hands — 
“and I know how to use this.” He 
touched his forehead. “But no 
professional training, no.” 

Harness looked up. “May I ask 
why you’re volunteering, Mr. 
Noonan? You’re not required to 
answer, of course, but for my own 
personal curiosity — ” 

Noonan smiled. A Volunteer 
had certain special privileges, and 
reticence was one of them. So 
long as he was deemed psycho- 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



125 



logically and physiologically fit 
for colonization, and so long as 
he was not rendered ineligible by 
the existence of young children 
who would be orphaned by his 
volunteering, and so long as he 
had not committed any serious 
crime, he was not required to ex- 
plain. But old-maidish men like 
Harness wanted to know all the 
gossip, Noonan thought. 

He said, “For your own per- 
sonal curiosity. I’m volunteering 
because I’m tired of staying on 
Earth and want to try someplace 
else. I’m not in debt and I haven’t 
ruined any innocent wenches 
lately and I’m not volunteering 
to escape from a dominating 
mother. I’m just signing up be- 
cause I want to see what it’s like 
out there.” 

Harness seemed terrified by 
the booming outburst. He shrank 
back in his chair and said, “Yes, 
yes, of course, Mr. Noonan. I 
wasn’t implying — now, if you’ll 
simply fill out the rest of this 
data blank — ” 

Noonan filled it out. When it 
came to the section that asked. 
How much time will you need to 
settle your affairs?, he wrote in 
impressive capitals, NONE. Sign- 
ing the sheet, he handed it back 
to Harness, who skimmed through 
it and lifted his eyebrows prissily 
when he came to the final entry. 

“You’re willing to leave im- 
mediately, Mr. Noonan?” 



“Why not? My affairs are in 
order. I don’t have much property 
and I don’t have much money, 
and I don’t have anybody to give 
it to. So I’ll just hand over every- 
thing I own to charity. I won’t 
be needing money where I’m go- 
ing.” 

“Very well,” Harness said 
crisply. “Today is October 8. Will 
you report back here in three 
days?” 

“Three days? Why?” 
“According to law, you have 
three days to reconsider your de- 
cision. If you still want to volun- 
teer at the end of the week, come 
back here and we’ll finish process- 
ing your application.” 

Noonan shook his head. “I ain’t 
gonna do any reconsidering. I 
made my mind up before I came 
in here.” 

V 

I really have to go next 
week?” Carol Herrick 
asked hopefully. She sat tensely 
rigid, back straight, knees pressed 
tightly together, staring across the 
wide uncluttered desk at the el- 
derly man who seemed, at the 
moment, to have absolute control 
over her destiny. “I mean, isn’t 
there some way I can get excused 
from having to go?” 

The Colonization Bureau man 
shook his head solemnly from 
side to side. 



126 



GALAXY 



“None?” Carol asked. 

“If you qualify, you have to 
go. That’s the law, and there’s no 
way around it.” 

Even delivered as gently as 
they were, they were stern words. 
Carol fought desperately to hold 
back the tears. She wanted to let 
go, to throw herself at this man’s 
feet, to soak his knees with her 
tears. How could they send her to 
some other world? It wasn’t right, 
she thought. She belonged here in 
San Francisco, with the fog and 
the bridges and the Sunday after- 
noon strolls in Golden Gate Park, 
not out on some strange alien 
planet. 

She said in a soft, confused 
voice, “But — why send me? I 
don’t know anything about space 
— about the stars. I can’t even 
cook very well. I’m not the sort 
of person they want up there.” 

“They want all kinds of people, 
child. You’ll learn how to cook, 
to sew, to skin wild animals. Space 
will turn you into a regular pio- 
neer wife.” 

The redness came back into her 
face. “That’s another thing. They 
are going to make me get married, 
aren’t they? All the colonists have 
to marry.” 

“Of course. And to bear chil- 
dren. We start each world with 
only fifty couples — but for the 
colony to survive, it has to mul- 
tiply. Don’t you want to get mar- 
ried, Carol? And have children?” 



“Yes, I do, certainly. But — ” 

“But what?” 

“I was waiting — waiting so 
long for the right one to come 
along. Turning down fellows, 
waiting to see what the next one 
would be like. And now it’s too 
late, isn’t it? I could have been 
married, maybe had a baby by 
now, and then I wouldn’t have to 
go — out there.” 

“I’m sorry. I’m supposed to give 
you the standard speeches about 
mankind’s destiny. Miss Herrick 
— Carol — but I suppose you 
wouldn’t appreciate them. All I 
can say is, I’m sorry — but you’ll 
have to accept your lot.” 

She stared dreamily past the 
man behind the desk, past the 
banner with its meaningless slo- 
gan, past the wall itself into a 
gray void. She said half to herself, 

“I waited so long — and now 
they’ll marry me to the first one 
who comes along. Won’t they?” 
“There’s a certain amount of 
choice, Carol. You’re not required 
to accept if you don’t like the 
man who selects you, you know. 
You can say no.” 

“But I’ll have to marry one of 
them. I can’t say no to all of 
them.” 

“Yes. You’ll have to marry one 
of them.”

tie, filled with a vague regret and 
with the mild resentment that 
was the only anger she was really 
capable of. 

Carol Herrick had never really 
given much thought to the entire 
immense question of Selection. 
Three years ago, on her nine- 
teenth birthday, she had gone 
downtown to this registry center, 
because the law required her to. 
She had given her name, and the 
doctors had examined her and a 
week or so later she had received 
the little card telling her that she 
had qualified, that her name was 
on file with the big Computer and 
that she was subject to Selection 
until she turned forty. 

She had figured out on a scrap 
of paper that she would not be 
forty until 2034, and that was so 
ridiculously far in the future that 
she could hardly visualize the 
stretch of years that lay between. 
So, because her mind could deal 
neither with the concept of Se- 
lection nor with an interval of 
twenty years, she simply forgot 
the entire matter. She was sub- 
ject to Selection, she knew. Well, 
what of it? 

Only the little blue slip in the 
mailbox had finished all that. 

VI 

A FTER completing his list of 
one hundred ten names for 
the 17 October blasting of the 



Gegenschein, District Chairman 
Mulholland turned his attention 
to the next item on his daily 
routine: finalization, as they so 
barbarously called it in Schedul- 
ing, of the previous day’s list. 

The October 16 ship was the 
Skyrover, departing from the 
Cape Canaveral base. Mulholland 
had prepared the usual quota of 
names; during the early hours of 
the morning, while he had been 
assembling the Gegenschein list, 
word was coming in from the local 
boards on the previous day’s Se- 
lections. Mulholland scanned the 
long yellow sheets. The Skyrover 
list would present no difficulties, 
he saw. There were fifty-one elig- 
ible males, fifty-two eligible 
women. 

He deleted the three surplus 
names, entered them on the prop- 
er form, and gave the deletion list 
to Miss Thorne. During the day 
three people somewhere in the 
United States would learn that 
they had received a minute re- 
prieve: instead of departing as 
they had been told on the Octo- 
ber 16 ship, they would be held 
over until October 17, and, if not 
needed to fill vacancies on the 
Gegenschein list, would certainly 
be included on the list of what- 
ever ship was scheduled for de- 
parture on the 18th. 

His job, Mulholland thought, 
was like a kind of cosmic jigsaw 
puzzle: a puzzle in which he used 



128 



GALAXY 



human pieces, scooping up a hun- 
dred at a time, discarding those 
which might be bent or broken 
and unsuitable for the pattern, 
fitting the rest into place. Each 
day another pattern had to be 
created; sometimes there were 
too many pieces, and some were 
put aside for another day. 

He completed the Skyrover 
list and sent it down the pneumo- 
tube to Brevoort, twenty stories 
below. Brevoort would phone 
Cape Canaveral and advise them 
verbally of the completion of the 
list; the list itself woufil be sent 
to Florida by fax at the same 
time. With the Skyrover under 
control, Mulholland was finished 
for the day. The time was 1400 
hours. At the Bangor starfield 
that moment, the Enterprise 
Three was blasting off, with one 
hundred colonists aboard, people 
who had been Selected a week 
before. 

It went on constantly, day and 
night — people registering for 
Selection, people being Selected, 
people reporting for blastoff, ships 
departing. Five ships leaving a 
day from the United States alone, 
sixty from the world, four hun- 
dred twenty ships a week. And, 
so immense were the heavens, it 
would be untold centuries before 
the last habitable planet had 
been colonized by men of Earth. 

1400 hours. The end of the day. 
Mulholland tidied his desk and 



said his goodbyes — most of the 
clerical workers had two hours 
more before their day ended — 
and left. As he stepped outside, 
into the bracing October wind, he 
tried to shrug off his day’s labor 
like an otter coming to shore and 
shaking itself dry. Once 1400 
hours came, he could stop being 
District Chairman Mulholland, 
wielder of the sacred staff; he 
could go back to being plain Dave 
Mulholland of White Plains, a 
short, reddish-haired, sadly stout- 
ening man of 43, who twelve 
years ago had left his post of As- 
sistant Professor of Political Sci- 
ence at C.C.N.Y. to go into the 
practice of Liberal Party politics, 
and who as his reward for loyal 
service to the Cause was entitled 
to condemn one hundred people 
a day to Selection, so long as his 
party happened to remain in 
power. 

A T 0900 the next morning, 
Mulholland was at his office. 
The Requisition Form was wait- 
ing for him, as always; fifty cou- 
ples were needed for the starship 
Aaron Burr, leaving Canaveral on 
the 18th of October. He went 
through the standard morning 
routine, authorizing the selection 
of one hundred ten names for the 
Aaron Burr. 

Two hours later, the first re- 
plies began to come in from the 
local boards on the Gegenschein 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



129 



Selectees. Mulholland put each 
form in the “Hold” basket and 
forgot about them until it was 
time to get back to the Gegen- 
schein list. He had already for- 
gotten about the Skyrover; now 
that its list was complete, it faded 
into the long blur of unremem- 
bered ships whose passengers 
Mulholland had authorized. 

After lunch — a tense affair as 
always; he never digested well 
on a working day — he turned 
his attention to the Gegenschein. 
His notes told him that one slot 
had already been filled; Noonan, 
the Volunteer sent through from 
Baltimore Board #212. Mulhol- 
land needed forty-nine men, fifty 
women to make up the comple- 
ment. 

Most of the East Coast and 
Midwest reports had come in al- 
ready. The western people, natu- 
rally, would take longer; in most 
cases the mail was just being de- 
livered now, out on the Coast. But 
there were enough early returns 
to begin working with. Mulhol- 
land began to sort through them, 
checking them off against his 
master file. 

Columbus, Ohio Board #156: 
We have examined registrant 
Michael Dawes and find him ac- 
ceptable for Selection . 

New York Board #11: We 
have examined registrant Cherry 
Thomas and find her acceptable 
for Selection . 



Philadelphia Board #72: We 
have examined registrant Law- 
rence T. Fowler and find him 
acceptable for Selection . 

And, mixed with the rest, a red 
slip that signified a turndown: 
Atlanta Board #243: We have 
examined registrant Louetta 
Johnson and find her not accept- 
able for Selection for the reasons 
detailed below . 

Mulholland paused, turned the 
red slip over, and read it. Louetta 
Johnson had been found after due 
medical examination to be in her 
twelfth week of pregnancy, this 
fact being unknown to Miss John- 
son, who therefore had not noti- 
fied the registry center of this 
change in her status. Mulholland 
managed a wan smile. Louetta 
Johnson’s lamentable lapse of 
virtue had saved her from Se- 
lection, whatever other conse- 
quences it might have for her in 
the future. 

He put her slip aside and 
crossed her name from his list. 
Within the next hour, he lost two 
more of his possibles; the 93rd 
Board, in Troy, New York, re- 
ported that Elgin MacNamara 
had been the victim of a fatal 
auto accident the very day of his 
Selection; the 114th Board, in 
Elizabethtown, Kentucky, regret- 
fully informed the District Chair- 
man that registrant Thomas 
Buckley had been taken into 
custody after allegedly shooting 



130 



GALAXY 



his wife and another man, and 
would not be eligible for a berth 
on the Gegenschein. 

¥>UT, despite these minor set- 
backs, the list slowly filled. 
By 1320 hours, Mulholland’s tally 
showed forty-three men and thir- 
ty-nine women assigned to the 
Gegenschein, with five of his 
original hundred and ten disqual- 
ified and twenty-three yet to be 
heard from. Not long after that, 
the first reports began to come in 
from the Far West: 

San Francisco Board #326: We 
have examined registrant Carol 
Herrick and find her acceptable 
for Selection . 

Los Angeles Board #406: We 
have examined registrant Philip 
Haas and find him acceptable lor 
Selection . 

A red slip from Seattle Board 
#360: Registrant Ethel Pines de- 
clared ineligible on medical 
grounds; registrant Pines has can- 
cer. Mulholland removed the 
name of Ethel Pines from his list. 

By 1340 hours, he was nearing 
completion. A quick check indi- 
cated that he had forty-eight men, 
forty-six women. Ten of his origi- 
nal hundred and ten were 
scratched, ineligible. One Volun- 
teer. Seven reports were yet to 
come in. 

Ten minutes later, they were 
in: five acceptables, two rejects. 
Mulholland drew a line under the 



column of male names quickly 
counted upward: fifty names in 
all, headed by Cyril Noonan, Vol- 
unteer. He was short one woman. 

Now he reached into his re- 
placement basket and drew out 
the three cards that had been left 
over from the Skyrover quota. 
One man, two women. Muholland 
put the man’s card aside. He 
flipped the other two cards into 
the air. One landed face up; he 
snatched at it — the card of a 
woman named Marya Brannick. 

Marya Brannick’s name was 
entered in the fiftieth slot on the 
distaff side of the Gegenschein 
list. Carefully putting the com- 
pleted Gegenschein list to one 
side, Mulholland took tomorrow’s 
Aaron Burr list from its pigeon- 
hole and inscribed the names of 
Irwin Halsey and Maribeth Jan- 
sen at the heads of the two col- 
umns. 

He buzzed for Miss Thorne. 

“Jessie, I’ve assigned the three 
leftovers from the Skyrover list. 
Brannick goes into the Gegen- 
schein, Halsey and Jansen are be- 
ing held over till tomorrow for 
the Aaron Burr.” 

Miss Thorne nodded efficiently. 
“I’ll see that the notification goes 
out to the local boards. Anything 
else, Mr. Mulholland?” 

“I don’t think so. Everything’s 
under control.” 

She gave him a toothy smile 
and scuttled back to her adjoin-

ing cubicle. Sighing, Mulholland 
checked the clock. 1358 hours. 
Astonishing how smoothly the 
Selection mechanism works, he 
thought. The list gets filled as if 
by clockwork. 

A ND it had been clockwork, he 
realized, with himself doing 
nothing that a robot was unable 
to do. He wondered what a film 
of himself at work on a typical 
day would look like, speeded up 
a little. Even more ridiculous 
than the ancient fast-camera 
films, no doubt. He would emerge 
on the screen as an inane fat little 
bureaucrat, busily pulling lists in 
and out of pigeonholes, inscribing 
names, juggling surpluses, carry- 
ing forth extra Selectees until 
they were needed, signing docu- 
ments, self-importantly buzzing 
for his secretary — 

It was an unflattering picture. 
Mulholland tried to blank it out, 
but the image refused to quit his 
mind. Thank God it was quitting 
time, he thought! 

He studied the completed Geg- 
enschein list again. It looked all 
right: the hundred names, fifty 
in each column, each on its ap- 
pointed line. He skimmed down 
the men’s list: Noonan, Cyril. 
Dawes, Michael. Fowler, Law- 
rence. Matthews, David. And 
right along to the names at the 
bottom: Nolan, Sidney. Sander- 
son, Edward. 



He checked out the women’s 
column next. Thomas, Cherry. 
Martino, Louise. Goldstein, Erna. 
And down to the last, the ink not 
yet dry on her name: Brannick, 
Mary a. 

Mulholland nodded. Fifty here, 
fifty there. The list was okay. He 
scrawled his signature in the 
proper place. Another day, an- 
other shipload, he thought. An- 
other cargo for his conscience. 

The long list of names wavered, 
blurred; he closed his tired eyes. 
But that was a mistake. His imag- 
ination responded by conjuring 
up images of people; names took 
on flesh, faces hovered accusingly 
in the air. Edward Sanderson, he 
thought — and pictured, for no 
particular reason, a short, slim, 
narrow-shouldered man with 
thinning brown hair. Erna Gold- 
stein — she might be a dark-haired 
girl with large eyes, who majored 
in dramatics in college and had 
hopes of writing a play, someday. 
Sidney Nolan — 

Muholland shook his head to 
clear it. He had managed to keep 
this from happening all day, this 
sudden taking on of flesh on the 
part of the names on his list. So 
long as he thought of them simply 
as names, as strings of syllables, 
everything was all right. But 
once they began asserting their 
humanity, he crumbled beneath 
the assault. 

Hastily he pressed his thumb 



132 



GALAXY 



against the sensitized spot, rolled 
up the sheet, stuffed it in its little 
cylinder, and sent it rocketing 
down the pneumotube to the 
waiting Brevoort. The Gegen- 
schein had her cargo, barring ac- 
cidents and possible suicides be- 
tween now and the seventeenth 
of the month. 

The clock said 1400 hours. The 
day was over. Mulholland rose, 
sticky with sweat, eyes aching, 
mind numb. He was free to go 
home. 

At least you only get Selected 
once, he thought. I have to go 
through this every day. 

VII 

T> ANGOR Starfield, from which 
three ships of colonists de- 
parted every week, covered six- 
teen square miles of what had 
once been virgin forest in north- 
ern Maine. The lofty firs were 
gone, now; the area had been 
cleared and levelled and sur- 
rounded by a fence labelled at 
thousand-yard intervals, NO AD- 
MITTANCE EXCEPT TO 
CLASSIFIED PERSONNEL, by 
order of Colonization Bureau. 

Within the fenced-off area 
there was surprisingly little in the 
way of construction. Since the 
starfield was for government use 
only, not commercial, there was 
no need for the usual array of 
terminals, passenger buildings. 



waiting rooms, and concessions 
that cluttered every commercial 
spaceport. The buildings at the 
Bangor field were few: a moder- 
ately elaborate barracks for the 
permanent staff, a more sketchily 
constructed housing unit for 
transients, a couple of staff 
amusement centers, and a small 
administration building. All these 
were huddled together in a com- 
pact group in the center of the 
cleared area. Fanning off in three 
directions were the blastoff fields 
themselves, kept widely separated 
because a starship likes a mile or 
two of headroom when it can get 
it. 

On the morning of 17 October, 
2116, two of Bangor Starfield’s 
three blastoff areas were occupied. 
On Field One stood the Andrew 
Johnson, solemnly alone with a 
mile of heat-fused sterile brown 
earth on each side: a tall steel- 
blue needle that towered erect on 
its landing-jacks and retractile 
atmospheric fins. The Andrew 
Johnson was scheduled for de- 
parture on the 20th of the month; 
tomorrow the service crews would 
swarm out to Field One to begin 
the three-day countdown that 
prefaced every departure of a 
starship. 

At present the service techni- 
cians were busily running the final 
tests on the Gegenschein, which 
stood in the center of Field Three, 
slim and straight, glinting golden 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



133 



in the morning sunlight. The 
Gegenschein was due for blastoff 
at 1600 hours that afternoon, and 
with the countdown in its final 
six hours the service crews scut- 
tled like busy insects through the 
ship, making certain that every- 
thing was in perfect order. Only 
once, twelve years before, had 
there been a major starship acci- 
dent, but it was hoped that there 
would never be another. 

Field Two remained empty. A 
returning starship, the Wanderer, 
was due back late that evening, 
and Field Two was being held 
open for it. A small service crew 
was on duty at the Field Two 
blockhouse, running final checks 
on the guidance system that 
would monitor the Wanderer into 
its landing orbit later in the day. 
Nothing could be left to chance, 
not with a hundred-million-dollar 
starship. 

From the upper floor of the 
housing unit for transients, look- 
ing out past the squat yellow- 
brick edifice that served as the 
permanent staff residence bar- 
racks, both the Andrew Johnson 
and the Gegenschein could be 
seen, one at the western end of 
the field, the other far to the east. 
Mike Dawes, who had arrived at 
the Bangor starfield at 0945 hours 
after an early-morning flight from 
New York, peered out the window 
of the small room to which he* 
had been assigned, looking first 



at the distant blue-tinted Andrew 
Johnson, then, turning eastward, 
at the much closer Gegenschein.' 

4 4 Vi^HICH one am I going on?” 
he asked. 

“The gold-colored one,” said 
the uniformed Colonization Bu- 
reau guard who had shown him 
to his temporary room. “It’s on 
Field Three, over there.” 

Dawes nodded. “Yes. I see it.” 

“You’ve got an hour or so to 
rest here and relax. At 1100 hours 
there’s a preliminary briefing ses- 
sion downstairs in the central hall. 
You won’t be able to miss it, just 
turn to your left when you leave 
the elevator. The briefing lasts 
about an hour. Then you’ll be 
given lunch.” 

“I’m not going to be very 
hungry,” Dawes said. 

The guard smiled. “Most of 
them never are. But the meal is 
always a good one.” 

At 1100 hours Dawes followed 
the flickering neon signs down 
the hall to the elevator, and from 
there to Room 101. Room 101 
was a huge auditorium in the 
center of the compound; several 
men in blue-and-yellow uniforms 
bustled about on a dais, adjusting 
a microphone, while pale, tense- 
faced civilians filtered in and took 
seats as far away from each other 
as possible. 

Dawes slipped into an empty 
row near the back and looked 



134 



GALAXY 



around, seeing his fellow Selectees 
for the first time. One hundred 
people were spread thinly about 
in an auditorium big enough for 
ten times that number. He man- 
aged an ironic smile at the way 
each Selectee had managed to 
place himself on a little island, 
insulated by five or six empty 
seats on each side from his near- 
est neighbor, as if afraid of im- 
pinging on the final hours of any- 
one’s privacy. They seemed to be 
ordinary people; Dawes noticed 
that most of them appeared to 
be in their late twenties or early 
thirties, and a few were older 
than that. He wondered whether 
the colonies were portioned out 
strictly at random, or whether 
perhaps some degree of external 
control was exerted. It was per- 
fectly within the range of proba- 
bility for the Computer to select 
fifty men of twenty and fifty 
women of forty to comprise a 
colony, but it seemed unlikely 
that such a group would ever be 
allowed to go out. 

Behind him, the auditorium 
doors closed. An officer with an 
array of ribbons and medals on 
his uniform front stepped up to 
the dais, frowned at the micro- 
phone, raised it a fraction of an 
inch, and said, “Welcome to Ban- 
gor Starfield. I’m Commander 
Leswick, and your welfare will be 
my responsibility until you blast 
off at 1600 hours. I know this has 



been a trying week for you, per- 
haps virtually a tragic week for 
some, and I don’t intend to repeat 
the catch-phrases and slogans that 
you’ve been handed for the past 
seven days. You’ve been Selected; 
you’re going to leave Earth, and 
you’ll never return. I put it blunt- 
ly like this because it’s too late 
for illusion and self-deception and 
consolation. You’ve been picked 
for the most important job in the 
history of humanity, and I’m not 
going to pretend that you’re going 
out on an easy assignment. You’re 
not. You’re faced with the tre- 
mendous challenge of planting a 
colony on an alien world trillions 
of miles from here. I know, right 
now you feel frightened and lone- 
ly and wretched. But never forget 
this: each and every one of you is 
an Earthman. You’re a represent- 
ative of the highest form of life in 
the known galaxy. You’ve got a 
reputation to live up to, out there. 
And you’ll be building a world. 
To the future generations on that 
world, you’ll be the George Wash- 
ingtons and Thomas Jeffersons 
and John Hancocks. 

“The planet you’re going to is 
the ninth out of sixteen planets re- 
volving around the star Vega. 
Vega is one of the brightest stars 
in the sky, and also one of the 
closest to Earth — 23 light-years 
away. You’re lucky in one re- 
spect: there are two colonizable 
planets in the Vega system, your

GALAXY 



world and the eighth planet, 
which is not yet settled. That 
means you’ll eventually have a 
planetary neighbor, unlike most 
other colonies which are situated 
on the only habitable world in 
their system. The name of your 
planet, by the way, is Osiris, from 
Egyptian mythology — but you 
can call it anything you like, once 
you get there. 

trip will take about 
-*■ four weeks, even by Ein- 
stein drive. That’ll allow you 
plenty of time to get to know each 
other before you reach your new 
planet. Captain McKenzie and his 
crew have made several dozen 
successful interstellar flights, and 
I can assure you you’ll be in the 
best possible hands. 

“The name of your ship, as 
you know, is the Gegenschein. We 
draw the names of our ships from 
three sources: astronomical terms, 
historical figures, and traditional 
ship names. Gegenschein is an as- 
tronomical term referring to the 
faint luminosity extending along 
the plane of the ecliptic in the 
direction diametrically opposite 
to the sun — the sun’s reflection, 
actually, bouncing back from an 
immense cloud of stellar debris. 

“I think that covers all the es- 
sential points you’ll need to know 
at the outset. We’re going to ad- 
journ to the mess hall now for a 
most significant occasion: the last 



meal you’re ever going to eat on 
the planet Earth, and also the first 
meal you will eat with each other. 
I hope you all have good appe- 
tites, because the meal is a special 
one. 

“Before we go in, though, I’m 
going to call the roll. When you 
hear your name, I want you to 
stand up and make a complete 
three hundred sixty-degree revo- 
lution, letting everyone get a look 
at you. This is as good a time as 
any to start getting to know each 
other.” 

He picked up a list. “Cyril Noo- 
nan.” 

A rangy, powerful-looking man 
in a front row rose and said, in 
a booming voice that filled the 
auditorium easily, “The name I 
use is Ky Noonan.” 

Commander Leswick smiled. 
“Ky Noonan, then. Incidentally, 
Ky Noonan happens to be a Vol- 
unteer.” 

Noonan sat down. Commander 
Leswick said, “Michael Dawes.” 

Dawes rose, blushing unac- 
countably, and stood awkwardly 
at attention. Since he was at the 
back of the auditorium, there was 
no need for him to turn around. 
A hundred heads craned back- 
ward to see him, and he sat. 

“Lawrence Fowler.” 

A chunky man in the middle 
of the auditorium came to his feet, 
spun round, smiled nervously, and 
sat down. Leswick called the next 



THE SEED OF 'EARTH 



137 



name, and the next, until all fifty 
men had been called. 

He began on the women after 
that. Dawes watched closely as 
the woman rose. Most of them, he 
saw, were eight to ten years older 
than he. But he paid careful at- 
tention. There was one girl named 
Herrick who interested him. She 
was young and looked attractive, 
in a widfe-eyed, innocent way. 
Carol Herrick, he thought. He 
wondered what she was like. 

VHI 

TT was probably an excellent 
meal. Dawes did not appreci- 
ate it, though. He ate listlessly, 
picking at his food, unable to en- 
joy the white, tender turkey, the 
dressing and trimmings, the cold 
white wine. Although he had over- 
come his initial bitterness over 
Selection, a lingering tension re- 
mained. He had no appetite. It 
was an inconvience shared by 
most of his fellow Selectees, evi- 
dently, judging by the way they 
toyed with their food. 

The Selectees had been dis- 
tributed at ten tables. Dawes was 
dismayed to find, when he took 
his seat, that he could not recall 
the names of any of the other nine 
Selectees at his table. But his em- 
barrassment was short-lived. A 
round-faced, balding man to his 
left said, “I’ll confess I didn’t 
catch too many names during roll- 



call. Maybe we ought to intro- 
duce ourselves all over again. I’m 
Ed Sanderson from Milwaukee. I 
used to be an accountant.” 

It went around the table. 
“Mary Elliot, St. Louis,” said a 
plump woman with streaks of 
gray in her hair. “Just a house- 
wife before my number came up.” 
“Phil Haas, from Los Angeles,” 
said a lean-faced man in his late 
thirties. “I was a lawyer.” 

“Louise Martino, Brooklyn,” 
said a dark-haired girl of twenty- 
five or twenty-six, in a faltering, 
husky voice. “I was a salesgirl at 
Macy’s.” 

“Mike Dawes, Cincinatti. Jun- 
ior at Ohio State, pre-med stu- 
dent.” 

“Rina Morris, from Denver,” 
said a good-looking redhead. “De- 
partment-store buyer.” 

“Howard Stoker, Kansas City,” 
rumbled a heavy-set man with a 
stubbled chin and thick, dirty 
fingers. “Construction worker.” 
“Claire Lubetkin, Pittsfield, 
Massachusetts.” She was a bland- 
faced blonde with a nervous tic 
under her left eye. “Clerk in a 
video shop.” 

“Sid Nolan, Tulsa. Electrical 
engineer.” He was a thin, dark- 
haired, fidgety man who toyed 
constantly with his silverware. 

“Helen Chambers, Detroit,” 
said a tired-looking woman in her 
thirties, with dark rings under her 
eyes. “Housewife.” 



138 



GALAXY 



Ed Sanderson chuckled uncom- 
fortably. “Well, now we know 
everyone else, I hope. House- 
wives, engineer, college student, 
lawyer — ” 

“How come there ain’t any rich 
people Selected?” Howard Stoker 
demanded suddenly. “They just 
take guys like us. The rich ones 
buy themselves off.” 

“That isn’t so,” Phil Haas ob- 
jected. “It just happens that most 
of the wealthy executives and in- 
dustrialists don’t get to be wealthy 
until they’re past the age of 
Selection. But don’t you remem- 
ber a couple of months ago, when 
they Selected that oilman from 
Texas — ” 

“Sure,” Sid Nolan broke in. 
“Dick Morrison. And none of his 
father’s millions could get him 
out.” 

OTOKER growled something 
^ unintelligible and subsided. 
Conversation seemed to die away. 
Dawes looked down at his plate, 
still largely untouched. He had 
nothing to say to these people 
with whom he had been thrown 
by the random hand of Selection. 
They were just people. Strangers. 
Some of them were fifteen years 
older than he was. He had only 
just stopped thinking of himself 
as a boy a few years before, and 
now he was expected to live 
among them as an equal, as an 
adult. I didn’t want to grow up 



so soon, he thought. But now I 
don’t have any choice, I guess. 

The meal dragged on to its 
finish around 1330 hours. Com- 
mander Leswick appeared to an- 
nounce a ninety-minute rest and 
recreation period. Boarding of the 
ship would commence at 1500 
hours, sixty minutes before actual 
blastoff time. 

They filed out of the mess hall 

— a hundred miscellaneous peo- 
ple, each carrying his own burden 
of fear and regret and resentment. 
Dawes walked along silently be- 
side Phil Haas, the lawyer from 
Los Angeles. As they reached the 
door, Haas smiled and said, “Did 
you leave a girl friend behind, 
Mike?” 

Dawes was startled by the sud- 
den intrusion on his reverie. “Oh 

— ah — no, I guess not. There 
wasn’t anybody special. I figured 
I couldn’t afford to get very deep- 
ly involved, not with four years 
of medical school ahead of me. 
Not to mention interning and all 
the rest.” 

“I know what you mean. I got 
married during my senior year 
at U.C.L.A. We had a hard time 
of it while I was going to law 
school.” 

“You — were married?” 

Haas nodded. They stepped out 
into the open air. There was no 
lawn, just bare brown earth run- 
ning to the borders of the star- 
port. “I have — had — two chil- 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



139 



dren,” he said. “The boy’s going 
to be seven, the girl five.” 

“At least now your wife’s not 
eligible for Selection herself,” 
Dawes said. 

“Only if she doesn’t remarry. 
And I asked her to remarry, you 
see. She’s not the sort of woman 
who can get along without a man 
around.” A momentary cloud 
passed over Haas’ bony face. “An- 
other two years and I would have 
been safe. Well, that’s the way it 
goes, I guess. Take it easy, Mike. 
I suppose I’ll see you at 1500 
hours.” Haas clapped Dawes 
genially on the shoulder and 
strode away. 

At 1500 hours, the gong in the 
hall rang again. The crisp voice 
out of the speaker said, “Atten- 
tion. Attention. All Selectees are 
to report to the front of the bar- 
racks for boarding ship. All Se- 
lectees are to report to the front 
of the barracks for boarding ship, 
at once.” 

TN THE hall, Dawes met Mary 
Elliot; the older woman 
smiled at him, and he returned 
the smile tensely. Several Selec- 
tees whom Dawes did not know 
joined them at the elevator, and 
they rode down together. 

“Well, this is it,” Mary Elliot 
said. “Goodbye to Earth. I thought 
this week would never end!” 

“So did II” exclaimed a willowy 
thirtyish brunette behind Dawes. 



“But it ended all right. So — so 
long to Earth.” 

Three motor-coaches waited 
outside the barracks. ^Guards in 
blue-and-yellow uniforms effi- 
ciently herded the Selectees into 
the first coach until it was full, 
then began channelling people 
toward the second. Dawes 
boarded the third coach; by that 
time, the first one was halfway 
across the immense spacefield. 
The uniformed men did their job 
with a calm impersonality that 
seemed faintly inhuman to 
Dawes. But, he reflected, they 
had to do this three times a week. 
All over the world, now, people 
were being herded into starships. 
By nightfall six thousand Earth- 
men would be on their way to an 
uncertain destination. 

Close up, the Gegenschein 
seemed immense. Standing up- 
right on its tail, it reared two hun- 
dred feet above the bare brown 
soil. Its hull was plated with a 
molecule-thick sheath of gold, by 
way of ornament; each of the 
starships had its own distinctive 
color. The hatch was sixty feet 
above the ground. To gain entry, 
you had to ride up a gantry lift 
that held five people at a time. A 
catwalk was available for those 
who wanted to climb. 

Dawes was in no hurry. He 
waited in line for his turn to 
enter the lift. Turning, he took 
his last look at Earth, sucked in 



140 



GALAXY 



his last planetside breath of 
Earth’s air. 

It was mid-afternoon. In the 
quiet isolation of the starfield the 
air had a clear, transparent qual- 
ity. There was a tangy nip in it; 
it smelled of distant fir and 
spruce. The sun was low in the 
October sky, and a brisk breeze 
swept in from the north. 

Now, at the moment of ship- 
boarding, Dawes began to think 
of all he would never see again. 
Never another sunset on Earth, 
never the moon full and pale in 
the sky, never the familiar con- 
stellations. Never again the glory 
of autumn-tinted maples, never 
the sight of football players rac- 
ing down a field, never again a 
hot dog or a hamburger or a 
vanilla sundae. Little things; but 
little things added up to a world, 
and it was a world he was leaving 
forever behind. 

“Next five,” came the guard’s 
voice. 

Dawes shuffled forward and 
onto the metal platform. The lift 
rose with a groaning of winches. 
Now that he was close to the 
ship’s skin, he could see the tiny 
pittings and indentations that 
told of previous service. The Geg- 
enschein looked newly-minted at 
a distance, but at close range the 
appearance was far different. 

The lift halted at the lip of 
the entry hatch. Hands gathered 
them in, and behind Dawes the 



lift began to descend for its next 
load. Within, fluorescent lights 
cast their cold beams on a cir- 
cular room which opened onto a 
spiral companionway at either 
end. 

“Men go up, women down,” 
chanted a space-tanned young 
man in starman’s uniform. “Men 
to the fore compartment, women 
aft.” 

¥^AWES clambered up the lad- 
der that lined the companion- 
way at- the top of the circular 
room. He realized that, in flight, 
gyroscopic balancers would keep 
the ship forever upright — but it 
was difficult to visualize the way 
the compartments would be 
oriented. 

At the top of the ladder an- 
other crewman waited. “Men’s 
dorm is straight ahead,” he was 
told. 

Dawes found himself in a 
compartment large enough for 
twenty-five persons. There was 
nothing luxurious about the com- 
partment: no money had been ex- 
pended on plush carpeting, mosaic 
tile walls, or the other trimmings 
customary in commercial space- 
craft. The walls were bare metal, 
unpainted, unornamented. 

Dawes recognized Sid Nolan, 
the engineer from Tulsa, already 
sprawled out in one of the accel- 
eration cradles. Dawes nodded 
hello and said, “What are we sup- 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



141 



posed to do, now that we’re here?” 

“Just pick out a cradle and sit 
down. Once everybody’s aboard 
they’ll tell us what happens next.” 

“Mind if I take this one?” 
Dawes asked, indicating the cra- 
dle that adjoined Nolan’s. 

“Why should I mind? Suit 
yourself.” 

Dawes lowered himself into the 
cradle. It was like an oversize 
lounge chair, suspended on shock- 
proof cables. At right and left 
there dangled safety straps to be 
buckled before blastoff. 

The chamber filled quickly. 
Dawes recognized Ky Noonan, 
the husky Volunteer, who entered, 
picked out a cradle, and immedi- 
ately strapped himself in with an 
expert hand. Ed Sanderson, the 
accountant from Milwaukee, was 
three cradles to Dawes’ left. 

Dawes’ watch said 1520 hours 
when the chamber was filled. A 
loudspeaker overhead crackled 
into life. 

“Settlers of the planet Osiris, 
welcome aboard the starship Ge^- 
enschein,” a deep, pleasantly res- 
onant voice said. “I’m Captain 
McKenzie, and for the next four 
weeks I’ll be in command of your 
ship. The compartments you now 
are in will be your residences for 
the entire journey — but you 
won’t be as cooped up as it may 
seem now. There are two lounges, 
one fore and one aft, and a galley 
where you’ll take your meals. 



“The Gegenschein carries a 
crew of nine, and you’ll meet 
them all soon enough. But I’ll 
have to point out now that this 
isn’t exactly a luxury liner. My 
crewmen have their own jobs to 
do, such as navigating, controlling 
the fuel flow, servicing the ship 
in flight. You’ll be responsible for 
the tidiness of your own cabins, 
and each day ten of you will serve 
with the crew to help prepare 
meals and clean the ship. 

“Blastoff will take place, as you 
know, at 1600 hours. We will 
travel on rocket drive for eighty- 
three minutes. At 1723 hours the 
rocket drive will cease to be op- 
erative, and we will make the 
Einsteinian conversion to nospace 
at 1730 hours. At 1800 hours din- 
ner will be served in the galley. 

“We’ll continue on Einstein 
drive for the next four weeks. In 
case any of you intend to get a 
last look at Earth as we blast off, 
please be informed now that there 
are no vision outlets or pickups 
anywhere in the ship but in the 
main control cabin. The reason 
for this is simple: any kind of 
porthole constitutes a structural 
weakness in the hull, and since 
better than 99% of the trip is 
going to be spent in nospace, 
where there’s nothing to see any- 
way, the designing engineers have 
eliminated the visual outlets. 

“Let me ask you now simply 
to relax, lie back, and get to know 



142 



GALAXY 



your neighbor. Blastoff time is 
thirty-five minutes from now. 
Thank you.” 

The speaker clicked off. 

Minutes ticked away. Dawes 
tried to freeze in his mind the 
image of the moon full in the 
night sky, the Big Dipper, the 
belt of Orion. Less than ten min- 
utes remained now. 

He tried to picture the layout 
of the ship. At the very top, at 
the rounded nose, the control cab- 
in and crew quarters were prob- 
ably located. Then, he thought, 
below that were the two male 
dormitories, one on each side of 
the ship. Then the central lounge, 
and below that the two female 
dorms. In the rear, the other 
lounge, and the galley. And be- 
hind them, the rocket combustion 
chambers and the mysterious 
compartment housing the Ein- 
stein Drive. 

He knew very little about the 
Einstein Drive. Only that its 
core was a thermonuclear gener- 
ator that, by establishing a con- 
trolled field of greater than solar 
intensity, created a stress-pattern 
in the fabric of space. And that 
the ship would nose through the 
stress-pattern like a seal gliding 
through a cleft in the Arctic ice, 
and the ship would enter the 
realm termed nospace. 

And then? Somehow, travelling 
faster than the normal universe’s 
limiting velocity, that of light, the 



Gegenschein would breast the gulf 
of light-years and emerge from 
nospace in the vicinity of Vega, 
to make a landing on Osiris by 
conventional chemical-rocket pro- 
pulsion. 

Far beneath him, Dawes sensed 
the rumbling of the giant rocket 
engines. There was a thunderous 
roar; a massive fist pushed down, 
against his chest, as the ship lifted. 
His heart pounded furiously un- 
der the strain of acceleration. He 
closed his eyes. 

He felt the pang of separation. 
His last bond with Earth, the 
bond of gravity, had been severed. 

IX 

T^AWES had never known four 
weeks could move so slowly. 

The novelty of being space- 
borne wore off almost at the be- 
ginning. In nospace, there was no 
sense of motion, no rocket vibra- 
tion, no feeling of acceleration. 
The ship hung motionless. And 
the hundred passengers, crammed 
mercilessly into their tiny vessel, 
began to feel like prisoners in a 
large cell. 

As “day” dragged into “day” 
and week into week, Dawes 
found himself going stale with 
the monotony and constant dis- 
comfort. He counted days, then 
hours, until landing. He slept as 
much as he could, sometimes fif- 
teen and sixteen hours a day. 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



143 



until he could manage to sleep 
no more. 

Little cliques were forming 
aboard the ship as the weeks 
passed. Groups of six or eight 
took shape: people from the same 
geographical area, or people of 
the same general age and intelli- 
gence groups, who saw something 
to share in their common misfor- 
tune. Dawes joined none of these 
groups. He was the youngest 
member of the colony, at twenty 
— by some fluke of the Computer, 
none of the other men was less 
than twenty-five, and most were 
in their early thirties ■ — and he 
stood to one side, unable to min- 
gle at ease with the older people. 
Many of them had lost wives, 
families, homes that had been 
built and furnished with care and 
expense, jobs that had cost them 
outlay of energy and vigorous ex- 
ertion. He felt guilty, in a way, 
that he had lost nothing more 
serious than his education and his 
chosen profession. Conscious that 
the other Selectees were adults 
and he himself something less 
than that, though more than a 
boy, Dawes established and ob- 
served the gulf between them, 
and made few friends. 

In the third week an election 
was held; Phil Haas was chosen 
Colony Director, running unop- 
posed. He announced that he 
would serve for one year and 
then would hold new elections. 



The colonists assembled granted 
him the right to rule by decree 
until a constitution could be 
adopted, and some sort of colonial 
council established. 

Dawes wondered about the 
unanimity of the election. Cer- 
tainly there were other men 
among the fifty who yearned for 
power. Why had they kept polite- 
ly silent while Haas was being ac- 
claimed? Men like Dave Mat- 
thews, Lee Donaldson: strong 

men, capable men, outspoken 
men. Perhaps they were just bid- 
ing their time, Devers thought. 
Waiting, letting Haas handle the 
difficult task of getting the col- 
ony in motion, then making their 
bids. 

Dawes shrugged. He had no in- 
terest in playing politics. He kept 
to himself, intending to do his 
job as a colonist as best he could, 
without looking for trouble. Let 
others fight among themselves for 
responsibilities; he was content 
to drift passively along. After all, 
he thought, he hadn’t asked to be 
sent here. Nor was he going to 
ask for any great share in the 
responsibilities. 

A T the end of the fourth week, 
finally — it seemed like the 
fourth century since blasting off 
from Earth — a shipwide an- 
nouncement sent the Osiris colo- 
nists scuttling back to their pro- 
tective cradles. 



144 



GALAXY 



“The time is 1443 hours, ship 
time. In exactly twelve minutes, 
at 1455, we’re going to make a 
transition out of nospace and back 
to rocket drive. We’ll enter the 
atmosphere of Osiris at 1600 
hours and take three hours to 
complete our landing orbit. We’ll 
touch down on the day-side of 
Osiris at 1900 hours, which will 
be exactly noonday down below. 
Everybody strap down now.” 

Dawes’ fingers quivered ner- 
vously as he lashed himself into 
the acceleration cradle. This was 
it! Landing in less than five hours! 

He wondered about Osiris. The 
Colonization Bureau had pre- 
pared a couple of mimeographed 
sheets about the planet for dis- 
tribution to the colonists, but the 
information on them was scanty. 
He knew that the planet was 
roughly Earthsize — 8100 miles 
in diameter — and that the soil 
was arable; that the air was like 
the air of Earth, only with a trifle 
less oxygen, a trifle more nitrogen, 
not enough of a difference to 
matter; that the planet had seven 
continents, of which two were 
polar and thus uninhabitable. Sur- 
vey team reports were never tre- 
mendously reliable: the survey 
teams moved with desperate 
haste, often scouting an entire 
solar system in a day or two, and 
once they found a world to be 
reasonably suitable they rarely 
bothered to look for drawbacks. 



According to the survey team re- 
port, there was no intelligent life 
on Osiris, at least not on the tem- 
perate northern continent that 
had been chosen for the colony. It 
was an easy statement to make; 
so far intelligent life had been 
discovered nowhere else in the 
universe. Many planets had spe- 
cies no more than a hundred 
thousand years away from intel- 
ligence, but nowhere but on 
Earth was there a culture, a civili- 
zation, as much as a language. 
Or so the findings had been so 
far. 

At 1455 hours came the shock 
of transition. The Einstein gen- 
erator lashed out, smashing a gap 
in the fabric of nospace, and the 
Gegenschein slipped through the 
aperture and back into the uni- 
verse of real things. Instantly the 
rocket engines came into play, 
guiding the ship into orbit round 
the planet below. In a series of 
ever-narrowing spirals the Gegen- 
schein would glide downward, 
matching velocities with Osiris, 
until its path grazed the skin of 
the planet and the ship came to 
rest at last. 

Lying pinioned in his accel- 
eration cradle, Mike Dawes 
clenched his teeth against the 
pounding of the rockets. The Geg- 
enschein was not insulated very 
well against engine vibration; it 
was strictly functional, a tube de- 
signed to transport people from 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



145 



one world to another, without pre- 
tensions to comfort. 

He regretted the lack of a 
vision screen. It might have been 
inspiring to see Osiris growing 
steadily ahead as the Gegenschein 
landed. Much more inspiring than 
lying on your back in a badly ven- 
tilated compartment, Dawes 
thought, lying in the half-dark- 
ness. Somewhere ahead in the 
night was Osiris, Vega IX, four 
billion miles from the fourth 
brightest star in Earth’s sky. 
Would Sol be visible in Osiris’ 
night sky? Probably — as an in- 
significant white dot of negligible 
magnitude. 

l^O ONE spoke as the Gegen- 
^ ' schein plunged planetward. 
Each man in the compartment 
was alone with his dreams and 
memories now. The minutes 
passed; at 1600 hours Captain 
McKenzie announced that the 
ship had entered Osiris’ atmos- 
phere at last. The actual landing 
was still three hours away, as the 
ship swung round the planet, 
coming closer and closer to the 
surface — 

1900 hours. Within his cradle 
Mike Dawes struggled to keep 
his stomach under control. The 
last hour had been a bumpy, 
bouncing ride downward through 
thickening layers of atmosphere. 
Atmospheric eddies jounced the 
golden ship; a storm layer buf- 



feted it. But the journey was end- 
ing. The Gegenschein hung low 
over Osiris’ northern temperate 
continent, dropping, dropping — 

Landing. 

The impact shuddered through 
the ship. The Gegenschein wob- 
bled only an instant before the 
landing-jacks took effect, digging 
into the ground. 

Captain McKenzie said, “We’ve 
landed right on the nose. Wel- 
come to Osiris, ladies and gentle- 
men.” 

We’re here, Dawes thought. 

He longed to burrow through 
the ship’s wall and see the new 
planet. But an hour more passed 
before the colonists could leave 
the ship. First, the routine atmos- 
pheric tests (“as if they’ll take us 
all back home if they discover 
that the air’s pure helium,” Sid 
Nolan grumbled). Then, the 
cooling-off period of fifteen min- 
utes while nozzles beneath the 
ship’s belly sluiced decontamina- 
ting fluids onto the landing area 
to deal with the radiation prod- 
ucts and chemical poisons of the 
rocket exhaust. 

After that, the opening of the 
hatch, the lowering of the cat- 
walk. No gantry lift waiting for 
them; descent from the ship 
would be by ladder only. Phil 
Haas and Mary Elliot were the 
first people out; after them came 
the others, filing in slow shuffle 
along the companionway until 



146 



GALAXY 



they reached the passenger exit 
hatch. 

Dawes was the twentieth to 
leave the ship. He stepped out 
onto the lip of the hatch. 

Osiris lay before him. The ship 
had landed in a clearing at the 
shore of a glittering blue lake. 
Beyond the expanse of pinkish- 
red sand, the soil became more 
fertile; not far away loomed a 
dark, ominous-looking forest, and 
high beyond rose arching black 
cliffs. 

Gray clouds lay heavily in the 
dark-blue sky like greasy puffs of 
wool. High overhead burned giant 
Vega, with its disc the apparent 
size of the sun of Earth, even at a 
distance of four billion miles. The 
air smelled subtly different — 
thin, with a salt tang to it that 
was nothing like the tang of the 
open ocean. And it was cold. The 
temperature was about fifty, but 
an icy wind came sleeting down 
out of the forest, cutting into him 
as he stood staring sixty feet 
above the ground. 

T¥E hadn’t expected it to be 
this cold. For no specific 
reason he had anticipated tropic 
heat. But Osiris, at least this con- 
tinent at this time of year, seemed 
bleak, inhospitable, uninviting. 

“Come on, kid,” someone said 
behind him. “Don’t stand there all 
day. Get down the ladder.” 

Dawes reddened and scram- 



bled hastily down the catwalk. 
The others were waiting below. 
The pinkish sand crunched un- 
derfoot. Feeling for the first time, 
Dawes thought with awe and 
wonder, the touch of a human 
foot. 

Chill winds swept down on him 
as he stood huddling into him- 
self for warmth, waiting for Haas 
to organize things, to take charge. 
As the colonists filed out of the 
ship, they wandered about aim- 
lessly on the beach, moving with- 
out direction or purpose or words, 
all of them struggling to minimize 
the shock of concrete realization 
that they were alone on an alien 
planet, never to see Earth again. 

At last all hundred had dis- 
embarked, as well as Captain 
McKenzie and his crew. 

Haas had obtained a whistle 
from somewhere. He blew it now. 

“Attention! Attention, every- 
body!” 

The wanderers returned to the 
group. Silence fell. The wind 
hooted through the distant forest. 

Haas said, “Captain McKenzie 
tells me that he intends to blast 
off for Earth as soon as possible. 
Our first job, then, is to unload 
the ship. We’ll do it in bucket- 
brigade fashion. Noonan, pick a 
team of five men and go with 
Captain McKenzie: you’ll be the 
ones to get the crates out of the 
ship. Sanderson, choose three and 
arrange yourselves near the ship 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



147 



to take the crates as they come 
out. We’ll pass them along until 
they’ve been placed over there, 
at the end of the beach, beyond 
the five hundred yard safety zone 
the Gegenschein is going to need.” 
Haas paused. “Matthews, take 
four colonists and go scouting 
around the area. Look around for 
any lurking wildlife, and yell if 
you see anything. The rest of 
you just stay in the area; no 
wandering off.” 

Dawes was passed over by the 
heads of the teams; he shrugged, 
thrust his hands in his pockets, 
and stood to one side. The cargo 
hatch in the belly of the ship was 
lowered open, and Noonan and 
his team entered, while the Geg- 
enschein crew clambered back up 
the catwalk to ready their ship 
for departure. In a few minutes, 
crates began appearing, heavy 
wire-bound wooden crates that 
contained all of Earth that there 
had been room to bring along. 

i^THERS lugged the crates 
across the clearing, out of 
the way of the ship’s rocket-blast 
area. The job took nearly an 
hour. Haas inventoried each crate 
as it appeared, checking it off 
against a master list. When half 
had appeared, he whistled again 
and rotated the teams, letting the 
tired men rest and putting fresh 
ones to work. Dawes took his 
place in the second team, hauling 



the crates away from the ship 
and over to the supply dump. 

The cargo hold was nearly 
empty when Dave Matthews 
came trotting out of the forest, 
shouting for Haas. 

The Colony Director turned. 
“What is it, Dave?” 

Matthews raced up, panting. 
Dawes and a few others stopped 
work to listen to him. 

Matthews gasped, “Aliens! I 
saw aliens!” 

Haas frowned. “What?” 
“Skulking around in the edge 
of the forest. Dark shadowy 
things. They looked like men, or 
apes, or something.” 

A twinge of fear went through 
Dawes. But Haas smiled. “Are 
you sure, Dave?” 

“How can I be sure? They ran 
away as soon as I went toward 
them.” 

“Did anyone else in your team 
see them?” Haas asked, looking 
at the other four members of the 
scouting patrol. 

“Not me,” Sid Nolan said. 

“Me neither,” Paul Wilson 
agreed. “We came running when 
Matthews shouted, but we didn’t 
see anything.” 

“And the survey team said 
there was no intelligent life on 
Osiris,” Nolan pointed out. 

Haas shrugged the matter off. 
“We’ll check later. You might 
have been mistaken, Dave.” 

“I hope so. But I wasn’t.”

The affair was allowed to drop 
there. At the moment, it was more 
urgent to empty out the Gegen- 
schein. 

The work made Dawes per- 
spire, and then he felt colder 
when a gust of wind came. But 
he enjoyed the mere activity of 
moving around, of using his mus- 
cles after four weeks of dreary 
confinement. 

At last the ship was unloaded. 
An assortment of packing-crates 
and smaller cases sat in disorder 
five hundred yards from the ship. 
The crewmen bustled busily 
about, checking off items on a 
vastly accelerated count-down. It 
took two days to prepare a ship 
for blastoff when it was laden 
with colonists and cargo; empty, 
it could be readied in only a few 
hours. 

While the crewmen worked, 
the hundred colonists boarded the 
ship for the last time, to prepare 
a meal in the galley. It would be 
their third meal of the day. But 
it was only, midday on Osiris, and 
Haas had ordered that work 
would continue until sundown, 
six or seven hours hence, so they 
would be adjusted to the new 
time-schedule from the very start. 
Dawes was on the cleanup crew 
after the meal. When he emerged 
from the ship, finally, he saw 
Haas and Captain McKenzie in 
conference. Haas was counting, 
to make certain everyone was off 



the ship. There was always the 
chance of a stowaway. 

He blew his whistle. “Attention, 
all! The Gegenschein is about to 
blast off! Everyone over by the 
cargo, right away! The Gegen- 
schein is leaving!” 

Final preparations took twenty 
minutes. Mike Dawes, standing 
in the safe zone with the other 
colonists, felt a sharp inward tug 
as he saw the ship seem to draw 
back on its haunches, retracting 
its landing jacks in the last few 
moments before blastoff. This 
was the last link with Earth, the 
golden ship at the edge of the 
lake. 

The warning honk died away 
and the ship sprang suddenly up 
from the ground, hovering on its 
blazing pillar of flame for a mo- 
ment as it fought with Osiris’ pull, 
then, breaking loose, shot upward 
to the cloud-muddied sky. For 
half a minute, perhaps, the re- 
treating rocket-blast added a 
second sun to the sky. A strange 
luminous glow cast double shad- 
ows over the ground, but faded 
rapidly. The Gegenschein was 
gone. 

A life hardly begun was fin- 
ished now, Dawes realized.

]PHIL HAAS mounted a pack- 
^ ing-crate at the far end of 
the clearing and blew his whistle. 



THE SEED OF EARTH

It was time to get things set up. 
Dawes joined the gathering- 
group. 

“We’re on our own now,” Haas 
said, speaking loudly to fight the 
insistent whistling of the wind. 
“That ship is gone and it isn’t ever 
coming back. We’ve got plenty to 
do how. The first thing is to set 
up the stockade and inflate the 
domes.” 

A voice from the back of the 
group — Dave Matthews’ voice 
— called out. “Phil, what about 
those aliens I saw? I think we 
ought to have a permanent secur- 
ity patrol, just in case they come 
back.” 

Haas’ lean face darkened. “The 
important thing is to get the 
stockade built immediately.” 

“But the aliens — ” 

“There’s some doubt as to 
whether you actually did see 
aliens, Dave. Remember, the sur- 
vey team didn’t find any such 
creatures here — ” 

“How long did they look? Half 
an hour? 

Haas said with a trace of im- 
patience, “Dave, if you want to 
discuss this further, take it up in 
private with me. We can’t spare 
men for a patrol until the stock- 
ade’s been built. Besides which, 
your aliens, if they exist, are 
probably more afraid of us than 
we are of them.” Haas chuckled. 
“Let’s get busy. We’ve got plenty 
more things to do by nightfall — 



important things — including the 
marrying.” 

Dawes moistened his lips. Yes, 
the marrying! He had pushed the 
thought into the back of his mind, 
but now there was no avoiding 
it. 

He drew his jacket tighter 
around himself. Like most thin 
people, he had little use for cold 
weather; the wind seemed to cut 
right through his jacket and be- 
tween his ribs. The survey-team 
report had said Osiris was Earth- 
type, uninhabited, and fairly 
fertile, but they hadn’t said 
anything about that damned 
nor’wester that ripped down con- 
stantly from the forest. 

Haas stepped down from his 
packing-crate and called over 
Noonan, Stoker, Donaldson, and 
several of the other stronger men 
of the group, to discuss plans for 
setting up the colony. According 
to the booklets that had been 
distributed before landing, there 
was a fixed and time-tested pro- 
cedure for setting up a new col- 
ony — a procedure that had 
worked well on the hundreds of 
worlds to which humanity had 
already spread. 

The first step was to establish 
a stockade, to mark the original 
boundaries of the colony and to 
provide a tangible measure of 
the colony’s foothold, as well as 
to serve in keeping stray alien 
creatures away. 



150 



GALAXY 



Once the stockade was up, the 
bubble-houses went up, the homes 
of the colonists. No more the 
painstaking hewing of logs for 
cabins; the new bubble-houses 
sprouted simply and easily from 
the extrusion nozzles. A gallon of 
the self-polymerizing fluid could 
serve to create homes for thou- 
sands of colonists; once it was 
gone, the science of architecture 
would begin on the new world. 

/^NCE the fifty couples were 
settled, the next matter was 
that of being fruitful and multi- 
plying. Since the colonists were 
screened for fertility, it was 
reasonable to expect thirty or 
forty offspring in the first year 
of the colony, twenty or thirty 
in each succeeding year. By the 
time ten years had passed, the 
older children would be able to 
care for the new crop of babies. 
After fifteen years, the total pop- 
ulation of the colony might be as 
much as five hundred — and the 
first second-generation marriages 
would be taking place. Given un- 
limited space and no economic 
problems, breeding could be un- 
limited for several generations. 
Population would expand: eight 
hundred, a thousand, fifteen hun- 
dred. It leaped upward by ex- 
ponential bounds in each genera- 
tion. And the colony spread out- 
ward into the alien wilds, until 
the raw settlement became a vil- 



lage, a town, a city, a city among 
other cities. One by one, a series 
of new Earths would thus be 
carved across the reaches of space 
by grumbling, miserable, con- 
scripted pioneers. 

Haas took a while to formulate 
his plans for the first day’s work. 
Dawes waited at the edge of the 
clearing. The idle colonists, in no 
hurry to receive their orders, had 
formed into the shipboard cliques 
again. Eight or nine women stood 
in one bleakfaced little clump not 
far away, their faces reflecting 
their realization of where they 
were and how dead their past 
lives were. Further away Dawes 
saw a circle composed of the 
younger unmarried men, joking 
tensely, nudging each other in the 
ribs. The four married couples — 
the Wilsons, Zacharies, Frys and 
Nortons — remained apart, as if 
emphasizing the fact that they 
would not be concerned with the 
mass mating soon to take place. 

Dawes stole a look at the little 
group of women. At least half of 
them were far too old for him to 
begin to consider as a potential 
mate. If he had last choice, he 
might indeed have one of them 
thrust at him, but he hoped not. 

A strange uneasiness stole over 
Dawes and he turned his atten- 
tion away from the women. One 
of them would be his wife, on this 
bitter, wind-tossed world. He 
would know which one soon 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



151 



enough. He did not dare specu- 
late on which. 

Haas had finished working out 
his plans. He whistled once again 
for attention. 

“The order of business right 
now is to get the stockade up. 
You’ve been divided into six work 
gangs. Gangs one, two, and three 
will be led by Ky Noonan, How- 
ard Stoker, and myself. We’ll dis- 
tribute blasters to those three 
gangs and you’ll gather tree- 
trunks for the backbone of the 
stockade. Work gang four will be 
under Sid Nolan, and that gang 
will be in charge of placing the 
trunks in the ground. Work gang 
five, under Lee Donaldson, will 
bind the trunks together with per- 
mospray. Work gang six, under 
Mary Elliot, will unpack the 
crates and provisions.” 

TT was neatly arranged. Most of 
the men were assigned to the 
three logging groups. Dawes and 
sixteen others went into Nolan’s 
group, which did the actual build- 
ing of the stockade. The women 
were split between Donaldson’s 
group and Mary Elliot’s. 

The work went off smoothly 
enough, thanks to the tools sup- 
plied by Earth. The forest was 
thick with barkless trees twenty 
feet high and six or eight inches 
in diameter; the three logging 
groups made swift work of burn- 
ing them down, trimming away 



the limbs and the fragrant needly 
foliage, and sizing the trees to a 
uniform twenty-foot length. It 
took only a few minutes to pre- 
pare each tree; within half an 
hour, several dozen were stacked 
at the border between the forest 
and the clearing. 

At that point, Nolan’s group 
went into action. They had al- 
ready laid out their boundaries, 
and now it was a simple matter 
of scooping out a pit with the 
vacuum extractor, shoving the 
sharpened point of the trunk 
some four feet into the ground, 
and tamping down the ground. 
Dawes hove to with the rest, feel- 
ing a pleasant thrill at the thought 
that the colony was under way, 
that his hands were helping to 
shape its walls. 

As the row of stakes grew, 
placed regularly in the ground 
three feet apart, Donaldson fol- 
lowed along with the extrusion 
machines, spewing out a binding 
layer of plastic between each 
wooden rib. And within the stock- 
ade boundaries the women 
worked, ripping into the sealed 
crates and laying bare their con- 
tents. 

After nearly two hours of 
steady work, the stockade had 
taken definite shape on three 
sides. After three hours, it was 
practically finished, and Haas and 
his crew, no longer required to 
supply more logs, were fashion- 



152 



GALAXY 



ing the gate and bolt for the 
stockade’s entrance. Already the 
place seemed snug, the winds less 
cruel, Dawes thought. He felt ex- 
hausted from his work, the con- 
stant hoisting of logs and placing 
them in the ground, but it was 
a good kind of exhaustion, the 
warm feeling of constructive ex- 
ertion. 

Nightfall came. Giant Vega 
had dipped far below the horizon, 
and a sprinkling of unfamiliar 
constellations brightened the 
darkening sky. No moon had 
risen. But, by floodlights, the 
work had gone on. The stockade 
was nearly perfect, having sprung 
up miraculously in only a few 
hours. And the bubble-houses had 
been blown: fifty of them, small 
opaque blue domes that glinted 
dully in the floodlights’ glare. A 
fifty-first dome, larger than the 
rest, stood in the very center of 
the stockade. It would be the cen- 
tral gathering-place of the colony 
in the early days. 

Dawes hunkered down on his 
heels, resting. He was tired; his 
muscles would ache in the morn- 
ing. But the colony was off to a 
flying start. The stockade was 
built and the homes were erected. 

“Swell job, everyone,” Haas 
congratulated them. “We’re right 
on schedule. And it’s wonderful 
the way you all pitched in and 
did your share.” 

“What about wives?” Noonan 



asked. His voice echoed loudly 
inside the stockade. 

A tense, apprehensive giggle 
began among the women, and 
rapidly spread through the group. 
Haas held up his hand for silence. 
“I was just getting to that part of 
it now. It’s the one remaining item 
of business.” 

I^AWES tensed. His stomach 
felt strange, and his hands 
were colder than they ought to 
be. Wives. The moment had 
come. In a few hours, he was go- 
ing to have a woman for the first 
time. He wondered what it would 
be like — whether it would be the 
way he expected it to be. 

Probably not. Somehow, noth- 
ing ever was. 

The women looked strained, 
oddly tense, as Haas organized 
them into a group for the mate- 
picking. Dawes studied their 
faces. Cherry Thomas was smil- 
ing, openly expectant; she wanted 
a mate, and it didn’t seem to 
matter to her who she got. Some 
of the other women looked wor- 
ried, pale, tense. Those were the 
ones who had never been married, 
who had dreamed of a different 
sort of wedding-night, before 
their number came up. Others, 
those who had left husbands be- 
hind on Earth, were obviously 
thinking of their loved ones tril- 
lions of miles away. 

Haas unfolded a sheet of paper 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



153 



and frowned. “The time has come 
to couple off. The instructions I 
have suggest the following recom- 
mended procedure for handling 
this. As a Volunteer, Ky Noonan 
has the right to take first pick. 
As Colony Director, I get second 
pick. After that, we proceed in 
order of Computer Registration 
Number — an order known only 
to me, at the moment. I think 
that way is better than any other 
system, and unless I hear any 
strong objections that’ll be the 
method we’ll use.” 

No one spoke. Dawes privately 
wished that someone would speak 
up in favor of a more gradual 
system — say, letting things take 
their natural course, couples 
forming as the days went by. But 
colonies were warned against 
such arrangements. It was far 
safer to establish couplings right 
at the start, having everyone in 
the small community settled at 
once. 

“Very well,” Haas said. “We’ll 
go down the list. Each man will 
select a woman, but she has the 
right of refusal. In case your 
choice refuses you, you don’t get 
to pick again until every other 
man has spoken. If anyone re- 
mains uncoupled after three run- 
throughs, I’ll make assignments 
myself. Okay. Noonan, as a Vol- 
unteer you’ve earned the privilege 
of picking first. Step forward and 
name your choice.” 



Noonan came forward, smiling 
calmly. He was the biggest, most 
aggressive male in the group, and 
he gloried in the confident knowl- 
edge of his own superiority. 

He ran his eyes insouciantly 
down the row of waiting women. 
A strange mixture of emotions 
appeared on fifty feminine faces. 
Some of the women seemed fear- 
ful of being picked by him, others 
openly hostile, others pleadingly 
anxious. 

After a moment of hushed si- 
lence, Noonan said, “All right. I 
pick Cherry Thomas.” 

Dawes let his breath out ex- 
plosively. He had been certain 
that Noonan would pick Carol 
Herrick — but he had bypassed 
her in favor of the older woman, 
for some reason. 

Haas said, “Miss Thomas, is 
this choice agreeable?” 

Cherry Thomas stared levelly 
at Noonan, appraising him frank- 
ly. There were wrinkles creasing 
the skin around her eyes, and her 
flashily metallic smile seemed in- 
sincere and false. “I guess so,” she 
said. “If Noonan wants me. I’ll 
go with him.” 

TTAAS made an entry on his 
list. “So be it. You can have 
your pick of any of the bubble- 
houses. Suppose I say now that 
any marriage can be dissolved on 
Osiris by approval of the Council, 
once we have a Council. Until 



154 



GALAXY 



then, let’s try not to have any 
split-ups.” 

Dawes watched Noonan and 
Cherry stroll away to take their 
pick of house-site. No ceremony? 
He wondered. It didn’t seem so. 
The simple act of picking solem- 
nized the marriage. Well, Dawes 
thought, it’s a brand-new world. 
Perhaps it’s better this way. 

Haas was next, and to no one’s 
surprise picked Mary Elliot, who 
accepted. That was a foregone 
conclusion, of course. 

The Colony Director looked 
down at his list again, and an- 
nounced that Lee Donaldson had 
next pick. Donaldson, a strong, 
commanding-looking man, strode 
forward and announced his choice 
loudly: “Claire Lubetkin.” 

Claire reddened, fidgeted, nib- 
bled her lower lip. Haas put the 
question to her. She wavered in- 
decisively, glanced around at the 
other men, and finally nodded. “I 
accept the choice.” 

After Donaldson came Howard 
Stoker. He came forward in his 
bear-like, rumbling walk, with the 
dirt of his day’s labor still clinging 
to him. 

He eyed the women as if mak- 
ing up his mind at the last mo- 
ment and said, “Rina Morris.” 
Ninety-odd pairs of eyes fo- 
cused on Rina Morris. The red- 
haired girl drew herself up stiffly. 
She looked at the thickset, ugly 
Stoker with an expression that 



was anything but friendly. “Sorry. 
I’ll wait a turn.” 

Stoker scowled at her angrily. 
“Okay. If you’re going to be that 
way, to hell with you. I pick Carol 
Herrick instead.” 

Dawes whitened at the thought 
of Stoker pawing over Carol. He 
wanted to shout out, to protest. 

But Haas said, “Sorry, Howard. 
I told you before that regulations 
don’t give you a second choice 
until everyone else has spoken.” 
“But — ” 

“You heard me. Stoker.” 
“Dammit, I’m not going to wait 
at the end of the line! Just be- 
cause that slut is too proud to 
have me, I — ” 

Haas said in a voice that sud- 
denly crackled with authority, 
“You’ll do whatever I tell you to 
do, Howard. Get back in line and 
wait your turn. Mike Dawes has 
next choice.” 

Stoker grumbled something, 
spat ostentatiously, and walked to 
the rear of the group. Dawes 
stumbled forth red-faced, still as- 
tonished at the sudden reprieve. 
Carol had been picked by Stoker, 
and Haas had refused to allow 
the choice, and now it was his 
choice — 

A row of faces confronted him. 
Kindly maternal faces; frightened 
faces; amused faces. And one 
face above all others. Dawes 
searched for the words. 

“I p-pick — I pick Carol Her- 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



155 



rick,” he stuttered, not daring to 
look at her. 

Haas smiled. “Miss Herrick?” 

Dawes waited for an agoniz- 
ing span of time. He could not 
look at Carol’s face. He stared 
away, at the ground, too tense 
to draw a breath. 

Finally she said, in a voice so 
soft it could barely be heard, 
“I accept.” 

XI 

l^AWES and Carol left the 
clearing together, walking 
rapidly away without speaking, 
virtually without looking at each 
other. 

He said to her finally, as they 
approached the circular row of 
bubble-houses, “We’d better pick 
one out.” 

“Pick any one you like — Mike.” 

He glanced at them. The 
domes were empty, merely arch- 
ing shelters against the down- 
slanting winds, but they did pro- 
vide a place to sleep if you didn’t 
mind the ground. Colonists were 
not supposed to mind little things 
like having to sleep on the ground 
until there was time to build beds. 

He pointed at the bubble-house 
that adjoined Noonan’s. It might 
be a good idea to have Noonan 
as a neighbor, Dawes thought. 
Just in case of trouble. 

“Let’s take that one,” Dawes 
said. 



They walked toward it, Dawes 
carrying his own suitcase and 
hers, each with its twenty pounds 
of personal possessions. At the 
entrance to the dome he paused, 
wondering vaguely whether he 
should bother with the old ritual 
of carrying his wife across the 
threshold. He nearly put down 
the suitcases to turn to her; then, 
changing his mind, he simply 
walked inside the dome. She fol- 
lowed him in. 

Within, the dome covered an 
area of perhaps two hundred 
square feet. There would be 
room for a bed and perhaps a 
clothes cabinet of some sort, not 
much else. Plumbing would come 
a while later; until that time, they 
would have to make do with the 
nearby lake for washing and 
drinking. 

“It isn’t very impressive, is it?” 
he asked. 

“No. Not very.” 

“We’ll fix it up. These domes 
are just temporary, just places to 
stay until we can begin building 
homes. We’ll have a swell place 
some day, Carol.” 

He smiled encouragingly at 
her. But she could not keep up 
the pretense; she sank down onto 
her suitcase and stared bleakly 
off into nowhere. Dawes began to 
wonder about the sleeping ar- 
rangements for the night. They 
would have to spread out all their 
clothes, he thought, and huddle 



156 



GALAXY 



together under layers of them for 
warmth — 

“I hadn’t expected it to be like 
this,” she said suddenly in a tone- 
less voice. “I mean, my life, and 
all. I never really thought much 
about what I was going to do 
with myself. But I didn’t figure 
I’d end up in a little bubble on 
some other world.” 

“Neither did I. Neither did 
any of us, Carol.” 

“But we’re here, aren’t we?” 
He nodded. After a moment 
he said, “What did you do, on 
Earth?” 

“Do? Oh — I was a stenogra- 
pher. Typist, mostly. For a con- 
struction firm in Oakland. I guess 
I was just waiting around to get 
married, when the time came. 
Well, I guess the time did come 

— sort of.” 

l^AWES was disappointed. He 
had never asked her before 

— he had never dared to speak 
much with her on the ship — 
but he had privately hoped she 
had been an actress, a writer, per- 
haps a singer. Someone with a 
talent, someone he could be 
proud of, someone who would 
stand out from all the other 
women. He decided he would 
have to be content with her slim 
prettiness, and let all else go. She 
was, it seemed, just an ordinary 
girl, shyly innocent. 

“I was going to college,” he 



said. “Pre-Med. Ohio State. Well, 
that’s all finished too. We have to 
start all over, here on Osiris.” 

“It’s like a blind date,” Carol 
said quietly, when a few mo- 
ments had passed. “You and me, 
put together like this. A blind 
date that’s for keeps.” 

“Why did you say yes when 
I picked you?” 

“What else could I do? I didn’t 
want any of the others, the older 
men. You looked like somebody 
I could talk to, somebody I’d be 
happy with. Even if you are a lit- 
tle younger than me. It’s better 
than going with one of those old- 
er ones.” 

“I hope we’re happy together, 
Carol.” 

“I hope so too. But — Mike, 
I’m afraid — ” 

There were tears in the edges 
of her eyes. Dawes realized that 
she was rapidly losing her nerve 
and might well go off into wild 
hysterics any moment. That was 
not the way he cared to spend his 
wedding night. And he wouldn’t 
know how to handle her if she 
burst out in tears. 

He said as firmly as he could, 
“We’re going to have to make 
the most of things, Carol. You 
know what I mean. It’s going to 
be this way, now that our num- 
ber came up. You and me, to- 
gether on Osiris, and no turning 
back. Not ever.” 

She nodded. And then, after a 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



157 



frozen moment of silence, he 
found himself moving toward 
her, putting his arms round her 
thin shoulders, kissing her. It was 
a tender, tremulous sort of kiss, 
a tentative contact of dry lips, 
and it had hardly begun when it 
was interrupted suddenly by a 
harsh yell coming from the gen- 
eral direction of Noonan’s bub- 
ble at the left. 

He pulled back from her. “Did 
you hear something — a shout?” 
“It sounded like it was Noo- 
nan. Do you think he’s having 
trouble with Cherry?” 

“I don’t know. But — ” 

The shouts came again. And 
this time the words were unmis- 
takable. Noonan was bellowing, 
“Hey! Dawes! Dawes! Help!” 

I^OONAN and Cherry were 
^ ^ outside their dome. They 
were surrounded by dark shapes, 
black forms against the black- 
ness. Noonan was flailing at the 
shapes and shouting. 

“Get away from me!” the big 
man cried. “Hey, Dawes! Run! 
Get help!” 

Dawes froze, not knowing 
which way to turn. He heard 
Carol catch her breath sharply. 
His eyes, growing more accus- 
tomed to the dark, picked out 
the scene clearly now. 

Six or seven dark stubby fig- 
ures — unhuman figures — clus- 
tered around the struggling forms 



of Noonan and Cherry Thomas. 
Dawes saw hunched, neckless 
heads, thick shoulders, corded 
arms. He was too sick to run. He 
stood where he was, listening to 
Noonan’s cursing. Cherry’s fear- 
sharpened voice, and the occa- 
sional croaking grunt of a smitten 
attacker. 

Then he felt something cold 
and hairy touch him, and he 
heard Carol scream. 

Other colonists were coming. 
Dawes fought, fought for the first 
time since forgotten childhood. 
He fought with arms and legs, 
whirled and butted with his 
shoulders, kicked out at chunky, 
heavily furred figures he could 
only partially see. His nails 
clawed into a musky-smelling 
hide. He squirmed, wriggled, 
kicked again. And then he could 
fight no more. He was held tight, 
solidly clamped by thick alien 
arms. 

“Mike!” Carol whimpered. 

He felt a pang of inadequacy. 
“I can’t do anything, Carol. Not 
a thing. They’ve got me too.” 

“It’s the aliens,” came Noo- 
nan’s angry voice. “The ones 
Matthews saw. Hostile aliens.” 
His booming cry seemed to carry 
all over the colony ground. 
“Aliens!” 

Dawes felt himself being 
hoisted from the ground. Two 
powerful hands gripped his 
ankles, two his shoulders. He 



158 



GALAXY 



tried once again to resist, but it 
was like trying to break loose 
from the grip of a hydraulic 
press. 

He swayed. He realized he was 
moving. 

Dark shapes, and darker jun- 
gle. He was being carried toward 
the forest. He could see nothing, 
neither Carol nor Noonan nor 
Cherry. 

After a while, he stopped try- 
ing to break free. The aliens were 
handling him gently enough. He 
simply could not move, but they 
were carrying him along at a 
steady pace. Too bad there was 
no moon, he thought. He could 
make out the shadowy shapes of 
trees bending above him, but all 
else was indistinct. He heard 
night-birds crowing harshly, 
mocking him from the treetops. 
Fear enshrouded him; he was 
too frightened even to be afraid, 
any more. Carried along in the 
soft alien grip, he offered himself 
up to fate, knowing he had no al- 
ternative. 

^^HE journey went on for more 
than an hour. Perhaps it was 
two hours; it might just as well 
have been two months. Dawes 
lost all sense of the passage of 
time. The forest was surprisingly 
thick, for such a cold continent; 
dangling vines brushed his face, 
one of them leaving a nauseous 
trail of slime. His hands were in 

THE SEED OF EARTH 



alien control; he could not even 
wipe his face. After a while the 
trail of slime, running down the 
left side of his face from eye- 
brow to the corner of his mouth, 
began to burn — whether for im- 
aginary reasons or because of 
some chemically corrosive effect, 
Dawes could not tell. He twisted 
his head around and managed to 
rub some of the slime off on the 
shoulder of his shirt. But an inch 
or two remained, just to the left 
of his eye, tormenting him by its 
inaccessibility. He wondered if it 
would leave some sort of mark, 
perhaps a white scar or a pucker- 
ing of the skin. 

At last the trek through the 
forest came to its end. The aliens 
broke from^ the thicket and 
Dawes could see the bald, bare 
faces of the jutting cliffs, the up- 
thrust fangs of black rock that 
had looked so forbiddingly Goth- 
ic when he had first viewed them 
from the lip of the Gegenschein’s 
hatch. 

He began to feel the ascent. 
Going up the side of the moun- 
tain was a terrifying experience 
— the most terrifying since the 
actual kidnapping. 

The aliens, his night-sharpened 
eyes perceived, had thick bluish 
pads on their palms and on the 
soles of their blunt feet. Suction 
pads. 

The aliens gripped him firmly, 
at shoulders and feet, and started 

159 



to ascend the naked face of the 
cliff. Dawes swung dizzyingly 
back and forth as they rose. They 
were climbing the unvegetated 
rock as if it were a ladder, and 
with each new upward thrust he 
canted out over the emptiness, 
wisely refusing to look down. 

Then the upwardness ended, 
just when Dawes thought his 
mind would snap from the con- 
stant danger of the climb, and 
the aliens proceeded inward. Into 
a cave of some sort, that ap- 
peared to be hewn out of the 
face of the rock cliff. 

Dawes’ fertile imagination 
worked overtime. He pictured 
strange alien sacrificial rites tak- 
ing place in this Haggardesque 



cave. Or vampire bats lurking in 
the darkness ahead, grateful for 
the sacrifice being brought to 
them. 

But none of the dire perils he 
conceived came immediately to 
pass. The aliens simply left him 
in the cave. They put him down 
with surprising gentleness, leav- 
ing him to lie in cold, moist sand, 
turned their backs on him, 
walked away. In the utter dark- 
ness he could see nothing at all. 

He sensed other aliens moving 
about; he thought he could tell 
them by their ape-like shuffle. 
He wondered if the whole col- 
ony were to be carried off and 
deposited here in this cave. The 
survey-team said the planet was 




I 




uninhabited, he thought re- 
proachfully. But Dave Matthews 
was right after all. 

TTE sat quietly in the darkness. 

The sound of sobbing was 
coming from a point somewhere 
to his right. As background noise 
he could hear the gentle murmur- 
ing sound of flowing water, as if 
there were a stream bubbling in- 
side the borders of the cave. 

“Who’s there?” he asked. “Who 
are you?” 

“It’s Carol. Is that you, Mike?” 

Some of his fear ebbed away. 
At least, he thought, he was not 
alone! 

“Yes. Where are you, Carol?” 

“Sitting in sand, someplace. I 



can’t see. What’s going to happen 
to us?” 

“I don’t know,” Dawes said. 
“Don’t move. Stay right where 
you are and I’ll try to find you. 
Damn this darkness, anyway!” 
He looked around, trying to 
gauge the direction from which 
Carol’s voice had come. But he 
knew that no vector would be 
accurate in here. The walls of 
the caves would have a distort- 
ing effect. 

A voice he recognized as 
Noonan’s broke in, saying, 
“Dawes, is that you?” 

It came from someplace deep- 
er in the cave, behind him, high- 
lighted by resonating echoes. 
“Yes,” Dawes said loudly. “And 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



161 




Carol’s here too. Is anyone else 
there?” 

“I am,” said Cherry Thomas. 

Her declaration echoed around 
the cavern. No other voices en- 
tered in. Staring unseeingly 
ahead of him, Dawes waited a 
moment, then said flatly when 
the echoes died, “I guess it’s just 
the four of us, then, up here in 
this cave. What the hell do they 
want with us?” 

Nobody answered. 

Outside the cavern mouth, 
somewhere to his right, the end- 
less wind whipped around the 
mountains, whistling, moaning. 
Dawes shivered. In the darkness 
he could just barely see his own 
hand held before his face — and 
even then he could not really 
be sure whether or not it was 
imagination, not actual sight, 
that had put the image of the 
hand there. He had never ex- 
perienced a darkness of such in- 
tensity before. 

And he saw another darkness 
more clearly now — the darkness 
of a life that yanked a person out 
of his rightful place and threw 
him onto a strange world, and 
then when he had begun to carve 
some meaning and familiarity 
into the strangeness yanked him 
out again and tossed him in a 
windswept cave. He felt very 
alone, very young, more than a 
little frightened, just a little sick. 

He started to crawl across the 



cold wet sands that formed the 
floor of the cave. Evidently the 
brook he heard fan not too deep 
under the sand, close enough to 
the surface to impart a chill, and 
came bubbling out a few hun- 
dred yards deeper in the cave. 

No one spoke. There was 
steady sobbing, but he had little 
hint of direction. He had no idea 
even of how large the cave was. 

“Carol! Carol!” he called out. 

On hands and knees he groped 
in the blackness. After minutes 
of uncertain s' arrying, he felt a 
warm hand graze his, startling 
him a little. The hand found his 
wrist and tightened comfortingly. 

“Thank God,” he murmured. 

Blindly he reached out and 
touched a yielding body. Arms 
gathered him in. He almost felt 
like sobbing, out of gratitude, out 
of shared terror. 

When morning flooded bright- 
ly into the cavern, Dawes woke 
reluctantly, groggily, from a bi- 
zarre dream of alien worlds. He 
looked around. 

With a dull sense of shock and 
anguish he made the discovery 
that he had spent his wedding 
night in the arms of Cherry 
Thomas. 

XII 

^T^HE coming of daylight re- 
vealed Carol’s location to 
him. She was lying about a hun- 



162 



GALAXY 



dred feet up-cavern, a pathetic 
little bundle sprawled on the 
sand. She was still asleep, her 
knees drawn up into her body, 
her hands tucked under one 
cheek. 

And, at his side, he saw that 
Cherry also slept — her clothes 
disheveled, her bright blonde 
hair streaming every which way 
(the hair I fondled lovingly last 
night, Dawes thought in guilty 
self-condemnation), her mouth, 
vacuously open, lips drooping 
apart. Dawes felt as if he had 
soiled himself. His body ached; 
every muscle throbbed, his bones 
were chilled by the damp and 
cold, and he felt a general lassi- 
tude, the weariness of a body not 
yet accustomed to the exertions 
of love. 

Noonan was awake already. 
Dawes saw him far back in the 
cavern, over to the left on the 
side away from Carol. He was sit- 
ting up, arms clasped in front of 
him across his knees, looking 
amusedly at Dawes. 

“Morning,” the big man said 
with a grin. 

“Good morning,” Dawes said 
with a trace of primness that an- 
noyed him as he detected it. 

“Seems you got mixed up a 
little last night,” Noonan re- 
marked wryly. He didn’t look 
concerned by the switch. “This 
is your gal up here, you know.” 

Dawes reddened. “I — it was 



so dark — I didn’t know — ” He 
paused. There was something he 
had to know, but he could find 
no way of putting the question 
to Noonan. He said at last, “Tell 
me — did you — did you — ” 
He left the question unspoken. 
But Noonan grinned and said, 
“No, I didn’t touch your sweetie. 
Couldn’t manage to find her, to 
tell you the truth. But I’m not 
put out because of you and Cher- 
ry. Mistakes can happen. And 
you weren’t the first with her, and 
I’m not going to be the last, 
either.” 

With one easy gesture Noonan 
pushed himself to his feet and 
ambled downcavern toward 
Dawes, who stood waiting, con- 
templating the shattered ruin of 
his values as he glanced down at 
the sleeping Cherry. 

“These women will sleep 
through anything,” Noonan 
chuckled. His eyes narrowed as 
he saw Dawes more closely. 
“Christ, you look awful. Green in 
the face.” 

“I’m — pretty tired out.” 
“You getting sick?” 

Dawes shook his head. “I just 
feel washed out.” 

“You look sicker than just be- 
ing washed out.” 

“How am I supposed to feel?” 
Dawes demanded. “Who knows 
where the hell we are? What are 
these aliens planning to do to 
us? We may be stew by lunch-

time, Noonan.” Dawes’ voice 
sounded thin and high in his 
ears. 

“I doubt it,” Noonan said cas- 
ually. “But let’s take a look.” 

Together they strolled forward 
to the lip of the cavern. Dawes 
gasped. 

^^HEY were at least a hundred 
feet above the flat, dull- 
brown surface of Osiris. The cave 
was inset in an almost vertical 
rise of cliff. Above and below 
them were flat walls of black 
stone, gleaming faintly in the 
morning sun. And down below, 
on the distant ground, a few of 
the aliens moved in aimless pat- 
terns as if standing guard. 

Dawes pointed out past the 
thickly forested area. “Look 
there. That must be the colony, 
in that clearing all the way out 
there!” 

Noonan nodded. “A good ten 
miles or so. And we can see it 
easily. This is the damnedest flat 
world I ever saw, except for these 
cliffs.” He gestured downward, at 
the aliens. “Nasty bunch down 
there.” 

Dawes looked out and down. 
The aliens, at this distance, ap- 
peared to be nothing but yellow- 
brown splotches against the 
deeper brown of the soil. They 
were heavily furred, he saw, 
neckless, thick-bodied. He 
thought he could make out the 



bluish-purpleness of the suction- 
pads on the palms of their broad 
hands. 

Dawes stepped back from the 
rim of the cave-mouth, remark- 
ing with a levity he hardly felt, 
“It’s a long drop.” 

He glanced at the bigger man, 
who grinned and said, “Damned 
right it is. I’d say we were stuck 
here a while. We’ll just have to 
make the most of it.” 

Dawes quivered a little at 
Noonan’s words, which uncom- 
fortably echoed the words he’d 
spoken consolingly to Carol just 
before the alien attack. The re- 
minder of his unconsummated 
marriage was painful. He turned 
away, to survey the interior of 
the cave. 

The cavern was long and deep, 
deeper than it was wide; it 
slanted back downward, vanish- 
ing into a wall of rock at the 
rear beyond the penetrating 
range of the sunlight. Far to the 
back of the cave the little stream 
gushed forth out of the live rock, 
coursed along the cave floor for 
a space, and dropped below the 
surface again, puddling up into 
a small fast-flowing narrow lake. 
The morning air was cold and 
brisk; the wind wailed past the 
open mouth of the cavern in 
relentless pursuit of itself. 

They were a hundred fifty feet 
above ground, in a cold little al- 
cove in the side of a steep cliff. 



164 



GALAXY 



They had fresh water. They 
could survive here indefinitely, 
if — 

Hunger gnawed at Dawes’ 
middle. He said to Noonan, “Sup- 
pose we’re left here to starve to 
death? What if they don’t bring 
us food?” 

“We’ll eat each other,” Noo- 
nan said amiably. “Women and 
children first.” He yawned, show- 
ing sharp, strong white teeth, and 
Dawes half-thought he might be 
serious. There was never any tell- 
ing what idea Noonan might put 
forth as a serious suggestion. 

Yet he was glad Noonan was 
here. The older man radiated 
strength and competence and 
courage, all of them attributes 
that Dawes knew he himself con- 
spicuously lacked. Noonan was 
an adventurer. He had been a 
Volunteer. That took a kind of 
courage Dawes could hardly be- 
gin to understand, and he re- 
spected Noonan for it. 

“Let’s go wake up the women- 
folk,” Noonan suggested. 

“We might as well,” Dawes 
agreed. 

Y¥E headed to the back of the 
cavern, where Carol slept. 
Looking back, he saw Noonan 
stooping over Cherry, shaking 
her urgently from side to side. 

Carol still lay curled in her 
quasi-fetal position. She seemed 
so soundly asleep that Dawes re- 



gretted having to wake her. He 
knelt by her side, listened for a 
moment to the untroubled 
rhythm of her breathing, and 
wondered how she could be so 
calmly asleep in a place like this. 

He put his hand lightly to her 
shoulder. “Carol. Wake up, 
Carol.” 

She stirred, but her eyes re- 
mained shut — as if she did not 
want to wake, Dawes thought. As 
if she preferred the security of 
her dream. He shook her more 
energetically, and she began to 
awaken. 

“Carol? Are you up?” 

“What — oh — Mama, yes — 
I must have overslept — ” 

Her eyes opened and she sat 
up. For an instant she stared at 
Dawes, at the cave, with blank 
incomprehension. Then her 
dream of home faded and reality 
returned. 

“Oh — I was dreaming. I 
slept so soundly all night — I 
thought you were going to come 
to me, but you didn’t, did you? 
You — ” 

“Come,” he said quietly. “Let’s 
go down to the others. It’s morn- 
ing.” 

Cherry had awakened by this 
time; she stood stretching, 
knuckling her eyes, adjusting her 
clothing. Noonan, nearby, stood 
with arms folded. Dawes and 
Carol went toward them, and 
Cherry nodded at Carol, smiled 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



165 



ironically at Dawes as if to re- 
establish the rapport that had 
existed between them in the dark- 
ness of the vanished night. 

For a long moment the four of 
them stood apart and looked at 
each other. Just looked. And 
Dawes saw suddenly that life in 
the cave was going to be compli- 
cated. 

He knew Noonan and Cherry, 
certainly, grasped the general 
picture. At the moment, he had 
no way of telling whether or not 
Carol realized what he had done 
the night before, or, if she did, 
whether she understood the im- 
plications of his act. That mo- 
ment of love, in his blind, grop- 
ing, panicky need in the darkness 
of the night, drew the four of 
them together in a way Dawes 
only partly understood. Inward- 
ly he could be certain only that 
he had betrayed Carol. 

The four of them just looked 
at each other. 

Noonan was eyeing Carol’s 
trim figure and high, full breasts 
with unconcealed curiosity. Cher- 
ry seemed divided: she was glar- 
ing at Noonan in a wifely, almost 
henpecking manner, and yet at 
the same time frankly studying 
Dawes in a way both maternal 
and openly possessive. She 
wanted everyone, it seemed. 

Dawes himself felt terribly 
unsure of his emotions. By the 
laws of the colony, Carol was le- 



gally his wife. But he had never 
touched her, except for one fleet- 
ing interrupted kiss. And he had 
spent their wedding night with 
Cherry. 

66^'^^E’RE not going to have 
much privacy in here,” 
Noonan said at last, breaking a 
silence so taut it creaked. 

“You can say that again,” 
Cherry offered. 

“I won’t. But some of us are 
going to have to change their 
ideas a little. And I don’t know 
how long we’re going to be stuck 
up here, either — but I’d guess 
we don’t get out until someone 
gets us out.” 

“You don’t figure there’s any 
way we can get out ourselves?” 
Dawes asked. 

Noonan hunched his shoulders 
into a somber shrug. “I don’t 
have any snap ideas. It’s a long 
way down, that’s all.” 

“Those aliens,” Carol said in a 
hesitant voice. “They’re down 
there just watching us?” 

Noonan nodded. “There’s a 
bunch of them outside, in the 
valley at the foot of the cliff. 
We’re penned up here, and they 
can come get us any time they 
want. But there’s no way for us 
to get out.” 

“And I don’t suppose the col- 
ony is going to come rescue us,” 
Cherry Thomas said. “They 
won’t give much of a damn about 



166 



GALAXY 



US. Chalk us off as lost, I guess. 
They’ll be too busy defending 
their stockade.” 

“There isn’t any defense,” 
Carol said. “If they can walk up 
the side of a cliff, they can climb 
over a twenty-foot fence, can’t 
they?” 

Dawes said, “The colonists 
won’t rescue us. They can’t. They 
don’t even know where we are. 
If there still is a surviving colony, 
that is.” 

Noonan shook his head in 
agreement. “That’s a point. The 
aliens may have everybody 
cooped up, four to a cave. Or 
they may have just snatched the 
four of us. There’s no way of tell- 
ing.” 

“Well, we’re stuck here,” Cher- 
ry said. “But what are we going 
to do about food?” 

Noonan shrugged. “We can’t 
eat sand. Maybe the aliens will 
be nice about it and bring us 
something we can eat. Or maybe 
they won’t.” 

“Suppose they don’t?” Carol 
asked. 

“Then there are three things 
we can do. We can sit around 
in here and wait to starve to 
death, or we can take turns eat- 
ing each other, or we can simply 
jump out the front of the cave.” 
Noonan laughed cavernously. 
“I’d recommend the last idea. It 
makes for a quicker death, that 
way.” 



T^AWES walked to the lip of 
the cavern and peered down 
the vertiginous height. He was 
stunned to see alien faces peer- 
ing upward at him. There were 
about twenty of the aliens half- 
way up the side of the cliff, mak- 
ing no attempt to move closer, 
looking upward at him. Their 
blunt heads were almost entirely 
covered with short bristly yel- 
low-brown fur, from which dark 
blue eyes, piercingly intense, 
stared out. 

Dawes turned away. Suddenly, 
he heard a thump behind him. 

Surprised, he whirled and 
caught a glimpse of the purple 
suction-pad of an alien as it 
flashed and disappeared. A bun- 
dle lay at the mouth of the cave. 
Dawes ran to the edge of the 
cave and looked out. An alien 
was scampering down the side of 
the cliff to rejoin his fellows be- 
low. 

Dawes returned to the bundle. 
It was a package about the size 
of a man, wrapped in a reddish- 
yellow animal hide that was 
shaggy and rank. Frowning, 
Dawes undid the coarse twine 
that held the uncured hide to- 
gether and lay back the wrap- 
ping. 

His eyes widened. Rising, he 
cupped one hand to his mouth 
and called out to the others. 

“Hey, food! Come here, all of 
you! The aliens brought us food!” 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



167 



As Noonan and Cherry and 
Carol came crowding around to 
see, Dawes spread out the pro- 
visions. The largest item in the 
bundle was a freshly-killed ani- 
mal, small, foreshortened, vague- 
ly pig-like, with a hairless black 
skin. A stiff little tail about six 
inches long thrust out sharply at 
them. There was a deep gash in 
the animal’s throat, but other- 
wise it was whole, from its tail 
to its flattened snout and glassy 
yellow buttons of eyes. Strapped 
to the beast by a crude length 
of twine was a short, sharp knife 
made of some shiny gray mate- 
rial very much like obsidian. 

The bundle also included sev- 
eral clusters of milk-white fruits 
the size of large grapes, and some 
oblong blue gourd-like vegeta- 
bles with coarse, knobby skins. 
Dawes’ mouth watered. 

“So it looks like they intend 
to feed us,” Noonan said. “That 
may be good, or maybe it isn’t. 
I hope they’re not fattening us 
for a sacrifice.” 

“We’ll find that out soon 
enough,” said Dawes. “We’ll 
know whenever we get fed again. 
If they don’t throw us any more 
for a week, we can figure that the 
fattening idea is wrong.” 

“How did the bundle get 
here?” Cherry asked. 

“An alien climbed up the side 
of the cliff and tossed it in the 
entrance,” Dawes said. “Then he 



beat it. He looked like a big 
brown spider skittering down the 
rock wall.” 

Using the blade, Noonan sliced 
into the animal, while Dawes and 
the women watched. Dawes was 
fascinated with Noonan’s surgi- 
cal precision. The roughly-flaked 
stone knife was razor-sharp, and 
the big man had a ready way with 
the beast; he carved with the skill 
of a professional butcher. He laid 
the animal open speedily, pulling 
back flaps of its dark red under- 
belly-skin, and scooped out the 
warm entrails. He dumped them 
to one side. 

“At least,” Noonan said, “the 
alien blood is the right color.” 
He efficiently carved chunks of 
meat from the small creature. 
“Maybe this meat is poison and 
maybe it isn’t, but at least the 
blood’s right.” 

Carol shuddered. “I’ve never 
eaten raw meat. Isn’t there some 
way we can make a fire?” 

Noonan paused to glance up 
at her. “No, there isn’t,” he said 
emphatically. “I know you didn’t 
want to come on this trip, girly. 
But you’re here, now. You’d bet- 
ter be ready to eat plenty of raw 
meat — and worse things.” 

XIII 

^^HEY ate, and it was a strange, 
■*- silent, almost shamefaced 
meal. The veneer of civilization 



168 



GALAXY 



that still clung to all of them, 
even Noonan, dampened their 
spirits as they ate the bloody 
meat. 

Dawes was voraciously hun- 
gry, and it wasn’t as hard for 
him to overcome his conditioning 
against eating raw meat as he 
thought it would be. Still, some- 
thing about the sticky blood that 
ran between his fingers, pasting 
them together, made him queasy. 
And he could see that Carol had 
to make a visible effort to choke 
the meat down. Noonan ate with- 
out inhibitions; Cherry put away 
her share with a certain reserve, 
but with no outward show of 
revulsion. The meat had an odd, 
pungent taste about it, even raw, 
that made it more appealing than 
it might otherwise have been. 

There were ten of the blue 
gourds. After the meat course, 
Noonan doled out one gourd to 
each of them and put the remain- 
ing six aside. “In case we don’t 
get fed again too soon,” he ex- 
plained. “These things will keep. 
The meat won’t.” 

The gourds tasted sour, strong- 
ly acidified; they had a stringy, 
unpleasant texture, and needed 
plenty of chewing. But they were 
nourishing, and filled up the 
stomach well. Dawes finished his 
gourd quickly and turned his at- 
tention to the white grapes. 
These were doughy in consisten- 
cy, dry, and not very good. 



When everyone was through 
eating, Noonan gathered together 
the remnants of the meal, the 
bones of the small animal and 
the shells of the gourds, and 
hurled them from the cavemouth. 
After a distinct pause came the 
thudding sounds of landing. 

“Why’d you do that?” Dawes 
asked. 

“To show them that we appre- 
ciated the stuff. There’s no better 
way than to toss back a carcass 
that’s been cleaned of flesh. Any- 
way, we can’t have that junk sit- 
ting around in here.” 

Noonan pointed upcavern, 
where the little stream split the 
cavern floor into two roughly 
equal sectors. 

“Look here, Dawes. Suppose 
you and Carol take the far corner 
up there, on the right.” 

“And you?” 

“Cherry and I’ll stay on the 
left, a little ways lower down to- 
ward the cavemouth. That’s for 
sleeping. It’s the best arrange- 
ment we can make.” 

“It’ll be something like living 
in a goldfish bowl,” Cherry said. 

Dawes shrugged. “We’ll have 
to manage.” 

He rose, walked to the front of 
the cave, and peered out. Seven 
or eight aliens squatted on the 
ground a hundred fifty feet be- 
low, looking up. 

“More like a goldfish bowl 
than you think,” he said, turning 



THE SEED OF EARTH

around. “They’re watching us 
from down there. Just watching. 
As if — as if we were really fish 
in a bowl, or pets in a cage.” 

“Maybe we are,” Noonan said. 
He scooped up a handful of moist 
sand, compressed it in his 
clenched fist until it was a hard 
ball, and angrily hurled it down 
at the staring aliens. It broke 
apart in midflight and showered 
harmlessly down as a spray of 
sand. Noonan turned away, curs- 
ing softly. 

day dragged along horri- 
bly. Four people in an es- 
cape-proof cell a hundred yards 
long and perhaps seventy feet 
wide, without fire, without any- 
thing but themselves. And they 
hadn’t learned yet to like each 
other much. 

Dawes felt his nerves tighten- 
ing like the tuned strings of a 
fiddle. There was nothing to do 
in the cave but stare at each 
other, talk, tell jokes. And there 
was so little to talk about. Noo- 
nan was monolithic; he spoke 
only when he chose, never speak- 
ing just for the mere sake of 
making noise. Carol’s conversa- 
tion seemed to be limited to ex- 
pressions of faint hopes and fears; 
Cherry’s, to jokes and acid-tipped 
reminiscences. 

It was Noonan who broke the 
hypnosis. He snapped to his feet 
out of a cross legged position 



without using his hands. “I’ve got 
an idea,” he said. “Maybe it isn’t 
worth much, but at least I can 
try it.” 

He began to strip off his shirt, 
kicking off his shoes at the same 
time. 

“What are you going to do?” 
Dawes asked. 

Noonan unsnapped his trous- 
ers. “Take a look at that under- 
ground stream up back. I’m going 
to get in there and wander 
around a little. Maybe the 
stream comes out somewhere. 
Maybe we can all get out the 
other side.” 

He picked up his clothes, 
stuffed them under his arm, and, 
wearing only briefs, walked up- 
cavern to the place where the 
stream broke the surface of the 
cavern floor. Looking back he 
called, “Come on up here with 
me, Dawes. If you hear me yell, 
come on in after me.” 

Dawes joined him. Noonan 
tossed down the bundle of his 
clothes, stepped out of his briefs, 
and, naked, entered the water. It 
swirled knee-deep as he waded 
farther upcavern, then abruptly 
grew deeper. 

As it approached the height of 
his chest, Dawes said uneasily, 
“It’s dangerous to try this, Noo- 
nan. You may get trapped under- 
neath, somewhere. I won’t be 
able to hear you if you yell.” 

Noonan turned to glance back. 



170 



GALAXY 



His lips were blue, and despite 
himself he was shivering, but he 
smiled. “So? What of it? At least 
I tried.” 

He turned again and advanced 
toward the point at which the 
stream dipped below ground lev- 
el again and swept back into the 
mountain. Dawes heard Noonan 
suck breath in gaspingly, and 
then Noonan went under. Tense- 
ly Dawes began to count off the 
seconds. 

“Where did he go?” Dawes 
heard Cherry ask. 

He turned and saw both 
women standing behind him. 
That annoyed him; he did not 
want Carol to see Noonan’s 
naked body when and if he came 
out of the stream. He realized 
it was a foolish, prudish sort of 
thing, but the real reason, he 
knew, lay deep in his own shy- 
ness. 

“He went under,” Dawes said 
simply. 

“He’s been gone half a min- 
ute,” Dawes said a few seconds 
later. “He ought to be up soon.” 

“Suppose he doesn’t come up?” 
Carol asked. 

T^AWES did not answer. But 
he kicked off his shoes, 
knowing he’d be expected t6 go 
in after Noonan and try to find 
him. He started to shiver a little, 
and his hands went tentatively 
to his belt. 



How long could a man stay 
under water? Even a man like 
Noonan? 

“You oughta go in and look 
for him,” Cherry said. “He may 
be drowning.” 

“Yeah. I know.” 

The counting mechanism in 
his mind functioning automatic- 
ally now, ticking away the sec- 
onds. With a cold hand Dawes 
started to strip off his trousers, 
not worrying about modesty in 
the face of the cold stream that 
awaited him. 

Suddenly Noonan broke sur- 
face, head first — leaping up 
high above the water, gasping 
loudly for breath, plunging back 
down like a sounding whale. 

Choking, retching, he came up 
again, battled the swift current 
for an instant or two, and man- 
aged to pull himself to the edge 
of the water. Dawes waded in a 
couple of feet, grabbed his arm, 
and tugged him up on the sand. 

Noonan was blue all over; 
goosebumps of enormous size 
covered him. He lay there, 
sprawled out with his face down 
in the sand, drawing in breath 
with great hoarse sobbing sighs. 
Finally he looked up. 

“Cold,” he said. “Cold!" 

“You find anything?” Dawes 
asked. 

Weakly Noonan shook his 
head. “No. Not a damned thing. 
I followed the stream as far as I 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



171 



could. Nothing. Came back and 
couldn’t find the outlet. Thought 
I’d — thought I’d drown. Then I 
broke through.” 

He shivered convulsively. 
Dawes had never seen a man 
look so cold and completely ex- 
hausted before. Noonan contin- 
ued to sob for breath. 

“He’ll freeze to death,” Carol 
said anxiously. “He’s all wet and 
the sand’s sticking to him. We 
ought to warm him up somehow.” 

Dawes felt irritated by her 
show of sympathy. Noonan’s wild 
swim, he thought, had been noth- 
ing but a grandstand play; show- 
boating for the benefit of the 
women, and nothing more. 

“He’ll warm up by himself,” 
Dawes grunted. 

Cherry glared at him. “The 
hell he will. You leave him like 
that, he’ll catch pneumonia or 
something. But I’ll take care of 
him.” 

Dawes looked at her, startled. 
As she spoke, the blonde had 
wriggled out of most of her cloth- 
ing, and wore only a bra and 
sheer white panties now. He 
glanced away, reddening, but 
caught a peripheral sight of Cher- 
ry throwing down her remaining 
clothes defiantly. 

Whitely nude, she lay down in 
the sand next to the still gasping 
Noonan. She put her arms 
around him. 

“You two go away,” she said 



without looking up. “I’ll keep him 
warm.” 

T^O more food came that day. 

” The aliens obviously 
planned to give them just one 
meal a day — if that. 

“We need a hostage,” Noonan 
said, talking more to himself 
than to any of the others. “It’s 
the only way to get anywhere. 
Tomorrow we hang around the 
cavemouth until they bring the 
food — if they bring the food. 
When the alien shows up, we 
grab him.” 

“What good is that going to 
do.” Dawes wanted to know. 

“I don’t know,” Noonan said. 
“But at least it’s something, dam- 
mit! A sign that we’re doing 
something to get out. You want 
to sit on your can in here forever, 
kid?” 

“We probably will,” said Cher- 
ry. “Like goddam pets. Birds in 
a gilded cave. Why couldn’t the 
bastards have picked someone 
else? Why us?” 

Night was falling. Outside, in 
the valley, a red alien bonfire 
flickered. 

“They’re watching us,” Dawes 
said. “Watching all the time. 
They want to see what we’ll do. 
They want to see how long it 
takes before we start fighting, be- 
fore we hate each other’s guts, 
before we start jumping off this 
damned cliff to get free.” 



172 



GALAXY 



“Shut up,” Noonan snapped. 

Dawes ignored him. “I mean 
it! It’s like a lab experiment. I 
had experiments like this in 
psych class, in college. You take 
four rats, see, and you stick them 
in a cage. Or you put them on a 
treadmill, and toss them some 
food when they look bushed. 
That’s what we are, rats on a 
treadmill. The experimenter 
waits and watches, taking notes, 
looking to see how long it is until 
the rats start snapping at each 
other, until they drop from ex- 
haustion.” 

“I told you to shut up.” Noo- 
nan rumbled threateningly. “We 
can take it.” 

“Don’t kid yourself, Noonan,” 
said Cherry, half to herself. “The 
crackup’s coming. It won’t take 
long.” 

XIV 

TN the darkness of that second 
night, Dawes cradled Carol 
in his arms. 

His wife. Hollow mockery of 
a honeymoon. 

Beneath the constant bubbling 
of the stream came the sound of 
Noonan’s harsh laughter, and 
Cherry’s answering giggle. Noo- 
nan and Cherry had settled down 
for the night somewhere down- 
caveriTi In the utter darkness, 
there was no knowing where. 

Carol was warm, pliable, with 



a tense reserve of tightstrung 
nervousness. They were silent a 
long while, holding each other for 
warmth, and then out of nowhere 
she asked, “You slept with Cher- 
ry last night, didn’t you?” 

Even in the darkness, Dawes 
reddened. “Does it really mat- 
ter?” 

“I — suppose not.” 

“I didn’t know what I was 
doing. The kidnapping, and all, 
upset me. Cherry tricked me. She 
let me think it was you, last 
night.” 

“Oh,” Carol said. 

The whispered conversation 
died again. Noonan and Cherry 
were still noisily merry at their 
end of the cave. Dawes listened 
to his own breathing for a while, 
longing to possess Carol but wait- 
ing for some sort of cue. 

After a while the girl said, 
“How long can we stay living 
like this? The four of us. I 
thought you and Noonan were 
going to fight today.” 

“Noonan can kill me with his 
pinky and thumb. It wouldn’t 
have been much of a fight. But 
I was asking for it. I started to 
crack up.” 

Her lips grazed his, then pulled 
away. 

“That was your first time last 
night, wasn’t it?” she asked. 

“Yes.” Hesitantly. Better not to 
lie about it, Dawes thought. 

“Tonight’s mine,” she said. 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



173 



TN three days, Dawes was be- 
ginning to think that cave 
life might almost become bear- 
able. It was possible for human 
beings to adapt to almost any 
kind of situation, he told himself. 
Even living in a cold, windy cave 
on an alien planet. 

Food came regularly, about 
noon each day — the same as- 
sortment each time, a newly- 
killed beast, white grapes, gourds. 
Noonan’s plan of catching an 
alien and holding him as a hos- 
tage proved about as practicable 
as flying out of the cave, or walk- 
ing insectlike down the sheer 
face of the cliff. Each day the 
alien messenger would fling the 
food package into the cave and 
vanish before the watching men 
could move. They kept guard for 
two days, but without even com- 
ing close to success. The alien 
would climb the cliff, hurl the 
bundle in, and scamper away 
again. After two days Noonan 
and Dawes completely aban- 
doned the idea of being able to 
catch one. 

The blowup came on the 
fourth day, when Dawes and 
Carol were bathing. Carol had 
stripped, and crouched naked at 
the water’s edge, cupping up 
handfuls and rubbing her face 
and body to break the shock of 
climbing in. A sort of convention 
had sprung up in the cave: when 
one couple bathed, the others 



busied themselves elsewhere, to 
provide at least the impression of 
privacy. But as he prepared to 
undress and join Carol in the 
water, Dawes glanced around 
and saw Noonan leaning against 
the cave wall not far from the 
mouth, watching them. 

For a surprised second or two, 
Dawes had no idea of what to 
say. The convention in the cave 
had always been a completely 
unspoken one, and he knew Noo- 
nan cared very little about his 
own privacy or anybody else’s. 
But still, thought Dawes in angry 
annoyance, there was such a 
thing as common decency, even 
here in the cave. 

While he stared silently at 
Noonan, the big man smiled 
coldly and said, “Something 
wrong?” 

“What are you looking at?” 
Dawes demanded. 

“You want me to tell you?” 
“Just suppose you keep your 
eyes where they belong!” Dawes 
was angered by the big man’s 
casual amorality. It was just as 
easy for Noonan to look the other 
way and avoid such frictions. 

“Mike,” Carol whispered warn- 
ingly. “Don’t mate trouble with 
him. Don’t start a ruckus. Why 
can’t you just ignore him?” 

“No,” he said. “There are some 
things you just don’t do. He isn’t 
going to get away with this.” 

He became uncomfortably 



174 



GALAXY 



aware of Cherry’s mocking eyes 
on him, and Noonan’s. Carol 
stood at the water’s edge with 
her hands uncertainly shielding 
her body from view. “Get into 
the water,” he ordered the girl 
brusquely. “I don’t want him 
looking at you that way.” 

^ILENTLY, she obeyed him. 
^ Dawes walked downcavern 
to where Noonan waited, still 
leaning against the wall. The 
older man seemed to tower two 
or three feet above him, even 
leaning. 

Dawes said sharply, “Are you 
trying to make it worse in here? 
You didn’t have to look at her 
that way when she got undressed. 
There was no call for that.” 

“I’ll put my eyes wherever I 
damned please, sonny-boy. And 
I’m tired of your niceness. This 
isn’t any private hotel we got 
here.” 

“You don’t have to go out of 
your way to make life tough 
here,” Dawes returned. “I don’t 
want you watching Carol when 
we bathe, from now on, Noonan. 
Do you understand that? We 
can at least pretend we’re civil- 
ized — even if some of us don’t 
happen to be.” 

Noonan hit him. This time, 
Dawes expected the blow, and 
was ready for it. He rolled agilely 
to one side and in the same 
motion directed an open-handed 



slap at Noonan’s face, trying to 
catch him off-balance. 

The big man took it like the 
brush of a gnat’s wing, laughed, 
and tapped Dawes sharply in the 
pit of the stomach. Dawes felt 
his knees start to buckle. He 
caught himself, sucked in his 
breath. 

He swung wildly at Noonan, 
missed his face by a foot, and 
swung again. This time Noonan 
opened one big hand, grabbed 
Dawes’ flailing arm, and twisted 
it. 

Yelling, Dawes tried to break 
loose. He succeeded in clawing 
at Noonan’s throat with his free 
arm, distracting the big man’s at- 
tention for a moment. Dawes 
ripped loose from Noonan. He 
danced back a couple of feet, 
panting, feeling the excitement of 
combat even though he knew he 
was yet to score a telling point in 
the contest. 

He darted forward and flicked 
out a fist. Noonan clubbed his 
hand aside, stepped forward, hit 
Dawes almost gently on the point 
of his right shoulder. The impact 
stunned him; he felt the surge 
of pain ripple down his arm to 
his fingers. Desperately he tried 
to land a blow, but once again 
Noonan caught his wrist. 

This time there was no break- 
ing loose. Noonan inexorably 
forced him to the ground. 

“I’m gonna put my eyes 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



175 



wherever I please,” Noonan said 
quietly. There was no malice in 
his voice, nor anger; just a level 
affirmation of victory. “You hear 
that, Dawes? You ain’t giving 
any orders inside here. If I want 
to look at your girl. I’ll look at 
her, and you ain’t gonna tell me 
I can’t do it. Understand that, 
Dawes?” He walked away. 

Carol had remained upcavern 
by the stream during the entire 
fight. Now she came over to him. 
She was wet and still naked, but 
her nakedness didn’t seem to 
bother her now. After the fight, 
any pretense toward modesty in 
the cave would be irrelevant. 

She looked down at him with- 
out speaking, without smiling, 
without offering a word of sym- 
pathy. Dawes could not tell 
whether the grave look in her 
eyes was one of pity or of con- 
tempt. After a while she walked 
away, back to the stream, and 
began to dress. 

Dawes elbowed himself' to a 
sitting position and massaged his 
wrists. Downcavern he saw that 
Noonan had stretched out for 
a nap. Cherry was drawing 
sketches in the sand. The cave 
was very silent. 

He walked slowly back to the 
stream, knelt by it, and sloshed 
water over his face; the shock of 
the sudden coldness eased some 
of the pain of Noonan’s slaps. 
Shaking himself dry, Dawes went 



downcavern, past Cherry and 
Noonan, to stare out the mouth 
of the cave. The clearing below 
was packed with aliens. He won- 
dered if they had enjoyed the 
performance. 

XV 

A FTER that, there was a 
strange realignment of the 
tense relationships between the 
four prisoners in the cave. The 
incident of the beating was a sort 
of dividing-point, separating what 
had been from what now was. 

Dawes suffered the most; he 
had acted foolishly, rashly, in de- 
liberately inviting Noonan to 
trounce him, and he had lost 
status in Carol’s eyes. That was 
clear. The only sort of respect 
she could have for him would be 
based on his intelligence — and 
he -hadn’t acted intelligently 
toward Noonan. Further, Carol 
really wanted a man who could 
take care of her, who could pro- 
tect her from the tensions and 
rigors of existence in a frighten- 
ing world — and Dawes had not 
at all proved himself that kind 
of person. 

But sympathy came from an 
unexpected quarter — from Cher- 
ry, who glared at the invincibly 
self-sufficient Noonan, and of- 
fered soothing words to Dawes. 
Noonan glared back at her an- 
grily. His possessiveness was ob- 



176 



GALAXY 



viously beginning to irritate 
Cherry. Dawes wondered when 
the open split between them 
would come. 

The swirl of conflicting emo- 
tions tightened. Both women half- 
loved and half-pitied Dawes. 
Cherry was physically drawn to 
Noonan, but was repelled by his 
dominating ways, his assertion of 
ownership. Noonan claimed Cher- 
ry as his own property, but quite 
clearly he was interested in Carol 
as well. Around and around it 
went, while the aliens gathered 
outside, and the hours slid toward 
sundown and the moonless dark- 
ness of Osiris’ night. 

Dawes sat bitterly by himself, 
feeling that he had fallen into 
total disgrace. Cherry softly sang 
her old night-club songs, muffling 
their stridencies to avoid touch- 
ing off some new dispute in the 
cave. Carol did nothing. As for 
Noonan, he bathed, slept for a 
while, woke, and went to the 
front of the cave, flattening him- 
self strangely at the mouth, pok- 
ing his head out and staring down 
for a long time as if measuring 
some distance. 

After a time he came back and 
spoke with Cherry for a few mo- 
ments. Then, moving on, he went 
to Carol as she sat quietly against 
the cave wall, and nudged her. 

Dawes glanced up from his 
brooding. Noonan was saying 
something to her. He strained his 



ears to catch their words; but the 
expression on Noonan’s face told 
him all he really needed to know. 

Cherry crossed the cave, tak- 
ing a seat at Dawes’ side and put- 
ting her hand on his wrist as he 
began to clench his fists. 

“Don’t pay any attention to 
it,” she murmured. “It was bound 
to happen sooner or later. Don’t 
make him have to hit you again.” 
“Is she going to listen to him?” 

^HERRY shrugged. “I don’t 
know. But she may. You 
never can tell.” 

“I hate him,” Dawes said dark- 
ly. “I hate both of them. If he 
wasn’t twice my size — ” 

“Well, he is,” Cherry said. “So 
you might as well just relax.” 
She shook out her long blonde 
hair. It was getting stringy from 
lack of combing, and it seemed 
to Dawes that it was darkening 
at the roots. It didn’t surprise 
him much to find that Cherry’s 
blondeness was synthetic. 

He tried to relax, to ignore the 
fact that elsewhere in the cave 
Noonan was successfully taking 
Carol away from him. 

After a long silence Cherry 
said, “You know, Noonan thinks 
he knows a way out of here.” 
“What?” 

“Shh. He told me about it just 
a while ago. He says there’s a 
little ledge down the side of the 
cliff a way. Thinks we could 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



177 



manage to reach it with a rop>e 
ladder made out of our clothes. 
But he won’t say anything about 
it to you because he doesn’t want 
to help you.” 

Dawes scowled. “He’s got no 
right to keep something like that 
to himself — ” 

“Noonan never worried about 
rights. Besides, he doesn’t really 
think his idea could work. We 
might be able to get down, all 
right, but then the aliens would 
just bring us right back up here.” 

Dawes had to acknowledge the 
truth of that. He slumped back, 
the momentary spark of hope dy- 
ing. The waiting jailers below 
would never let them escape so 
openly, he thought. 

Shadows deepened in the cave 
as the angle of sunlight sharp- 
ened. Four days, Dawes thought 
leadenly. Four days of just Noo- 
nan and Carol and Cherry, and 
the captivity might well go on 
forever. 

The sun dropped almost out of 
sight; no more remained to the 
day but a few dim red flickers. 
The eternal wind howled wildly. 
In the dark, Dawes heard Carol’s 
laugh. 

ORNING. The fifth day. 

And the invisible threads of 
hatred coiled a little tighter 
around the four in the cave. 

Carol was unaccountably red- 
eyed and sullen, after her night 



with Noonan. She bathed alone. 
Dawes watched her, from the 
distance, without getting up. 
Carol had a lovely white body, 
lean, beautiful. It was a magnifi- 
cent woman’s body. But she 
wasn’t the right woman to be 
wearing such a body. She was 
like a little child in so many ways 
— helpless, frightened, selfish. 

When Carol was through wash- 
ing, Noonan bathed, and after 
him Dawes made his slow way 
to the rear of the cavern and 
plunged into the little stream, en- 
joying the sharp pain of the ice- 
cold water against his skin. 

At noon, the food-bundle was 
hurled into the cave right on 
schedule. They ate silently, Noo- 
nan dividing the food as usual 
and doing a reasonably fair job of 
it. Not a word had been spoken 
in the cave since dawn. Dawes 
looked out and saw the aliens 
massed below, in greater num- 
bers than ever before. He knelt 
and peered down the face of the 
cliff, trying to see Noonan’s ridge. 
Yes, there it was, a narrow, pre- 
cipitous shelf of rock projecting 
no more than a few inches from 
the cliffside. Turning, Dawes said 
to Noonan, “I understand you 
know how to get us out of here. 
Why the hell haven’t you spoken 
up about it?” 

“Who in blazes told you that? 
It’s not true!” 

“The ledge down there,” Cher- 




178 



GALAXY 



ry said. “Yesterday you told me 
that — ” 

Noonan slapped her viciously. 
Glaring at Dawes, he said, “Okay, 
so there’s a ledge down there. 
But my idea won’t work, any- 
way. Even if we got out, the aliens 
would just grab us and put us 
right back in the cave. Well, 
won’t they?” 

“Maybe not,” Dawes said. 

“Maybe not! Maybe not!” Noo- 
nan roared with laughter. “You 
can bet your pink bottom they 
will! You think they’ll just sit 
down there and let us traipse 
past them?” 

“Maybe. I know how to beat 
the aliens,” Dawes said in a level 
voice. 

Suddenly Carol started to 
laugh — a high, keening, mad 
shriek of a laugh, a sharply in- 
drawn “Hoo-ha.' Hoo-ha.'” re- 
peated over and over. It wasn’t 
hysteria, but the nearest approach 
to hysteria. Moments later Cher- 
ry was giggling, calmly, cynic- 
ally. 

“Keep quiet!” Dawes shouted. 
“Let me talk!” 

“We don’t want to hear any 
crazy nonsense out of you,” Noo- 
nan snapped. “Shut your mouth.” 

Dawes grinned oddly and took 
two unhesitant steps forward. 
There was only one way he could 
make Noonan listen to him. With 
careful aim he jabbed the big 
man sharply in the ribs. 



"l^OONAN was astonished by 

^ the assault. He glared at 
Dawes in amazement for an in- 
stant, and rumbled into action. 
His fists shot out blindly, crash- 
ing into Dawes’ stomach, pound- 
ing him under the heart. Dawes 
fought back grimly. He landed 
a solid blow on Noonan’s lip; 
then Noonan snarled angrily and 
cracked him backward with two 
fast punches in the midsection. 

Dawes landed hard, feeling 
pain lance through his body. He 
gasped for breath. Noonan stood 
over him, dispassionately kicking 
him. Each blow was a new agony. 

Finally it was over. Dawes 
lay crumpled on the ground, 
shielding his face. Noonan stood 
over him, and a strange expres- 
sion of guilt was beginning to 
cross his features. His lower lip 
was swelling. 

Sitting up, Dawes put his hands 
to his ribs; nothing was broken. 
He said hoarsely to Noonan, 
“Okay. You were spoiling to 
kick me around again, and now 
you did it. You got it all out of 
your system. I hope you did, any- 
way.” 

Noonan looked completely 
drained of fight. He didn’t speak. 
Dawes mopped a trickle of blood 
away from his lips and went on. 

“Noonan, you’re a strong man, 
and in some ways you’re a clever 
man. But you couldn’t figure a 
way out of here, and you were 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



179 



damned if you’d let me have a go 
at it without beating me up first. 
Okay. I got beat up.” 

“Listen — ” Noonan began un- 
steadily. 

Dawes cut him off. Despite the 
pain of the beating, he felt a kind 
of exhilaration. “You listen to 
me. We can get out of here, if 
we only cooperate. All four of 
us. 

“I don’t know what kind of 
things those aliens are — but 
they aren’t as primitive as they 
look. We’ve been writing them off 
as ugly ape-things, but they’re a 
lot subtler and smarter than that. 
I think they grabbed us out of 
the colony and stuck us up here 
so they could listen in on our 
emotions, soak them up, feed on 
them. They took four of us. Four 
people who hardly knew one an- 
other. They threw us here and 
left us alone. They knew damned 
well what would happen. They 
knew we’d start hating each 
other, that we’d fight and quarrel 
and build walls around ourselves. 
That’s what they wanted us to 
do. It would be a sort of circus 
for them — a purge, maybe. A 
kind of entertainment. Okay. 
They were right. We put on a 
good show for them. And I’ll bet 
they’ve been out there drinking 
up every bit of friction and hate 
and fighting that’s gone on in this 
cave since we got here.” 

Dawes paused. The words 



were flowing smoothly, now that 
he had been granted the floor, 
but he wanted to allow time for 
his ideas to sink into the other 
three minds. 

“Go on,” Noonan said quietly. 
“Finish telling us what you have 
to say.” 

“We don’t have to hate each 
other, that’s what I’m trying to 
get across. Sure, we get on each 
others’ nerves. Four saints in a 
cage like this would drive each 
other batty. But we can turn the 
hate outward. Hate them. And the 
best way we can show our hate 
for them is by loving each other 
instead of fighting. We’re playing 
into their hands by bickering and 
brawling. Let’s work together and 
try to understand each other. I’ll 
admit up to now I’ve been as 
selfish as any of you. We’re all 
equally to blame. But if we start 
cooperating now — hell, we’ll be 
of no more use to them than 
fighting cocks without any fight. 
And we can build that rope lad- 
der and they’ll let us go.” 

No one spoke when Dawes had 
finished. He let them think it 
over, and finally Cherry said, 
“They’re like parasites, then. Get- 
ting their kicks from our hate?” 

“You’ve got the idea.” Dawes 
looked at the big man. “Noonan, 
what do you say? You think what 
I said is worth anything?” 

Slowly, Noonan began to smile 
despite the swollen lip. “Yeah. 



180 



GALAXY 



Maybe you’ve got something. I 
guess we could try it.” 

XVI 

^T^HE rope ladder took nearly 
-*• every stitch of clothes they 
had. There was nothing else to 
use. 

“Okay,” Noonan said at last. 
“Maybe this’ll do. Let’s test it. 
Dawes, get yourself on the other 
end of this thing and pull hard.” 

Dawes took a double grip on 
the rope and pulled, as hard as 
he could, digging his feet into the 
sand to keep from being dragged 
toward Noonan. The line held. 

“Good,” Noonan grunted. 
“She’s tight.” 

He anchored the end of the 
line to a jutting rock near the 
mouth of the cave, hurled the 
free end out, and let it dangle. 
Leaning over the rim, Noonan 
squinted speculatively and said, 
“We’re still a couple of feet short. 
Let’s have underclothes.” 

No one protested. Noonan 
hauled the line in and tied the 
garments on. Dawes grinned and 
said, “Coming out of the cave is 
like being born. We come out 
naked.” He shivered from the 
cold, but the new camaraderie in 
the group warmed him. 

Noonan said, “I’m going to 
climb down to the ledge. Carol 
and Cherry will follow me. And 
then you, Dawes. All clear?” 



Noonan grasped the line, 
tugged it to make sure it was 
fast, and lowered himself over the 
edge. Just before he disappeared 
below the floor level of the cave, 
he grinned, and Dawes grinned 
back. 

“Good luck, Noonan.” 

“Thanks. I’ll probably need it.” 

Dawes watched tensely as Noo- 
nan descended, hand under hand, 
swaying in the wind. He dangled 
at the very end of the line, his 
hands grasping the rope only an 
inch or two from its end, and still 
his feet were a couple of feet 
short of the ledge. He let go; his 
feet scrabbled for purchase, his 
arms flailed wildly to balance 
him, and then he stood solid, look- 
ing up at them and smiling. 

“Okay,” Noonan called. “Carol, 
you come down next. Keep your 
feet clamped onto the rope and 
hold on tight.” 

Pale, frightened beyond the 
point of feeling fear, Carol took 
hold of the rope. She paused for 
an instant. 

“Go on,” Dawes said softly. 
“It’s safe. Just hold on let your- 
self down hand by hand.” 

The girl grasped the rope with 
her small hands, wrapped her 
legs round it, and started to de- 
scend. Dawes held his breath. 
The rope seemed tremendously 
long. Was she going to make it 
all the way? Or would she fatigue 
and topple off, still eighty feet 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



181 



above the ground — with the un- 
forgiving rock below?' 

She made it. She dangled in 
mid-air a few feet above Noonan; 
he stretched out his arms for her, 
urged her to let go, and finally 
she did. He caught her and put 
her safely down on the ledge. 

Cherry was next. She showed 
no outward sign of fear, and she 
negotiated the descent quickly 
and skilfully. Dawes waited until 
she stood by Carol’s side on the 
ledge. Then, taking a last look 
at the cave, he grabbed hold of 
the rope himself. 

TTE had done plenty of rope- 
climbing in high school, in 
an ultimately fruitless attempt to 
put some muscle on his skinny 
body. But those had been fifteen 
or twenty-foot ropes. This one 
dangled for a hundred feet, and 
no protective mat waited beneath 
it. 

Positioning one hand beneath 
the other, he let himself down, 
feeling the savage bite of the wind 
against his bare skin. He knew 
the others were waiting for him, 
watching him, maybe praying. 
Once, he glanced down, and saw 
he still had nearly half the dis- 
tance to go. His muscles were 
quivering and his arms felt as if 
they were about to part company 
with their sockets. But he made 
it. 

He hovered above the shelf 



and Noonan caught him around 
the waist and pulled him down 
to safety. The line swung out 
over the valley and flapped back 
against the side of the cliff. 

Dawes caught his breath and 
looked downward from the ledge. 
“We’re still at least forty feet 
from the ground. What now?” 

“I’m going to try to yank the 
line loose,” Noonan said. “All of 
you hold on to me. “If I can pull 
it down, we tie it on here and 
climb down to the ground.” 

“And if we can’t pull it down?” 
Dawes asked. 

Noonan glared for a moment. 
“You still haven’t lost your old 
habits. You ask too many dam- 
fool questions. Come on — anchor 
me.” 

They held him, while he 
tugged at the line, grunting bit- 
terly. Muscles corded and 
bunched along Noonan’s back 
and shoulders, and tendons stood 
out sharply in the hollow of his 
elbow. The line was tied too se- 
curely at the top, though. It 
would not come. Noonan pulled 
harder — 

The rope snapped loose with 
an impact that nearly threw the 
four of them off the ledge. Noo- 
nan looked at the end he held in 
his hands, then up at the dangling 
line still fastened at the cave- 
mouth. The rope had snapped in 
half. 

Noonan cursed eloquently. “I 



182 



GALAXY 



hadn’t figured on that. But it 
could have been worse, I guess.” 

“How much rope do we have?” 
Dawes asked. 

“Look for yourself.” 

Noonan let the line out over 
the side of the ledge. It stopped 
short nearly fifteen feet from the 
ground. And, Dawes thought, a 
fifteen-foot jump was an invita- 
tion for broken ankles or worse 
— and they still had a trek of 
perhaps ten miles back to the 
colony. 

He looked quizzically at Noo- 
nan. The big man said, “We can 
still manage it. But it’s going to 
take teamwork. Real teamwork. 
I’ll go down the rope. Dawes, you 
follow, go right on down me and 
hang to my ankles. The girls will 
do the same, and jump when they 
reach your ankles. It can’t be 
more than a six or seven-foot 
drop from there.” 

OOMEHOW, it worked. Noo- 
^ nan scrambled down the 
truncated rope as far as he could 
go, and hung there, waiting. 
Dawes went next, descending the 
rope until his feet touched Noo- 
nan’s shoulders, then carefully 
clambering down Noonan’s body 
until he grasped the big man’s 
feet. 

“Okay, come on!” Noonan 
shouted. “We can’t hang this way 
forever!” 

Dawes strained to hold on. His 



toes were about eight feet above 
the ground. Carol came down 
the rope; he could feel every im- 
pact as she descended. Looking 
up, he saw her coming down past 
Noonan’s shoulders, then reach- 
ing his own shoulders. Her face 
was white with tension. She clung 
for an instant to Dawes’ hips, slid 
down his legs, and let go. He 
glanced down; she had landed in 
a crumpled heap, but she was 
getting up. 

Cherry came next. Dawes’ arms 
ached mercilessly. He tightened 
his grip on Noonan’s ankles. But 
it was no use; he could not hold 
on. As Cherry’s foot grazed his 
shoulder, he let go and dropped 
to the ground. He folded up as 
he hit, but was able to rise with- 
out difficulty. Cherry still dangled 
from Noonan. 

“Go ahead,” Dawes called to 
her. “Let go and I’ll catch you.” 

She released her hold; Dawes 
braced himself and broke her 
fall, but the weight of her drop- 
ping on him knocked him over 
again. A moment later, Noonan 
landed on top of them. 

After some instants of confu- 
sion, they struggled to their feet 
and began to laugh. Cherry was 
the first to start, and then Noonan 
and Dawes and Carol took it up, 
and they laughed for nearly a 
minute at the ridiculous spectacle 
they must have made, solemnly 
clambering down each other and 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



183 



landing in a confused heap of 
arms and legs. 

“Damndest silly ■ way to get 
down a mountainside I ever saw,” 
Noonan said, still laughing. 

“Maybe so,” Dawes said. “But 
it worked, didn’t it? It worked!” 

They huddled together naked- 
ly at the base of the cliff. Above 
them, two lengths of rope dangled 
in the wind. 

Cherry said, “And there isn’t an 
alien in sight. Not anywhere.” 

Dawes looked rapidly around, 
as if expecting to see the thick- 
bodied ape-like beings clustered 
behind trees observing them. Per- 
haps they were. But certainly 
they were keeping well out of 
sight. 

“You see?” Dawes said trium- 
phantly. “They aren’t interested 
in us any more. We don’t have 
anything to offer them, now that 
we’ve stopped fighting with each 
other. They don’t care what we 
do now.” 

“I’m cold,” Carol said sudden- 
ly- 

“We all are,” said Cherry. “We 
better get a move on. Back to the 
colony, before the aliens decide 
they don’t want to let us go after 
all.” 

Dawes nodded. He pointed 
toward the forest. “Standing with 
our backs to the cliff, the colony 
ought to be straight out that way. 
What do you think, Noonan?” 

The big man frowned and said. 



“That’s about right. We ought to 
find our way back there through 
the forest without much trouble. 
If we start out now.” 

“Right. We want to get there 
before nightfall,” Dawes said. 
“We’ve still got a few hours left. 
We’d better start out now.” 

^T^HEY set out, in single file — 
Noonan leading, followed by 
Carol, then Cherry and Dawes. 
Even though the sun was bright 
in the sky, the day was cold; the 
temperature was barely above 
fifty, Dawes estimated. No tem- 
perature at all for people to be 
walking about in naked. 

He was thankful that they had 
kept their shoes, even if their 
stockings all had gone to rein- 
force the rope. The forest floor 
was covered with the dried 
prickly cast-off needles of the 
conifer trees that abounded there. 
The wind whipped through the 
forest, but the trees served as 
shielding for them against the 
coldest blasts. 

It had taken about two hours 
to go through the forest the first 
time, in the hands of the aliens. 
By Dawes’ reckoning, nightfall 
was not due for at least three 
hours more. With luck, if they 
followed a true path, they would 
make it back to the colony before 
dark. Once night fell, of course, 
they would simply have to squat 
down and wait for morning be- 



184 



GALAXY 



fore going on with the search for 
the colony. 

But Noonan led the way with 
such a confident air that Dawes 
did not worry. The big man 
strode along with springing step, 
looking back every few moments 
to make sure no one had fallen 
behind, and seemingly felt no 
discomfort from the cold or from 
his own nakedness. 

Dawes realized that a few 
months ago it would have been 
inconceivable for him to walk 
casually through a forest wear- 
ing nothing but a pair of battered 
shoes, in the company of two 
women and another man. Now, it 
hardly mattered. A new world, 
new values, he thought. After the 
days in the cave, modesty was ir- 
relevant. He knew the three 
bodies ahead of him as well as he 
knew his own. 

After an hour of walking, they 
stopped; Carol was exhausted. 
Noonan eyed the angle of the 
sun, wrinkled up his face, and an- 
nounced that they had at least 
two and a half hours before sun- 
set. “Plenty of time to make it,” 
the big man added. “If we don’t 
waste any time en route.” 

“I’m cold,” Carol said. “Hungry. 
Tired. I can’t keep walking like 
this.” 

Dawes looked at her pityingly. 
She looked drawn and exhausted. 
She had lost weight; her ribs lay 
close to the surface of her skin. 



now, and her thighs were puck- 
ered where the fat had gone, 
leaving pouches of skin. Carol 
had taken the days in the cave 
worse than any of them. Noonan 
hardly showed a trace of his cap- 
tivity; Cherry looked unkempt 
but healthy, with a sleek leanness 
that she had not had before. 
Dawes ached all over, but he felt 
splendid. 

“Come on,” he said gently to 
Carol. “We’re almost there. An- 
other hour’s walk, that’s all.” 

Noonan lifted her to her feet 
and pointed her in the right di- 
rection. They resumed their hike. 

f I ■'HEY were following a path, 
well-worn through the thick 
forest. Looking back, Dawes 
could see the black bulk of the 
cliffs — and, he thought, the two 
strands of rope, red and yellow 
and brown and green. As the sun 
dropped, the forest became cold- 
er. Birds hooted in the trees; 
small shiny-skinned animals that 
looked like lizards sprang up on 
rocks, chittered derisively at the 
group for an instant, and went 
hustling off into the safety of the 
woods. 

They plodded on. Dawes was 
beginning to feel the effects of 
his hunger — only one meal a 
day for the last five, and that 
nothing very nourishing. He 
longed to stop and try to shy 
a rock at one of the curious little 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



185 



forest beasts, but he told himself 
that if they ever stopped they 
might not get started again. He 
forced himself to drag one foot 
in front of the other. His legs 
ached. His feet, bare inside his 
shoes, were slowly being rubbed 
raw by the leather scraping his 
heel. But Noonan strutted jaunt- 
ily along in the lead. 

They were on their way back 
to the colony. Something strange 
and mysterious had happened to 
them, but it was over, and they 
were on their way back. Dawes 
comforted himself with that 
thought. In a little while, they 
would be seeing other people 
again. Haas and Dave Matthews 
and Ed Sanderson and Sid Nolan 
and all the others. They were 
really strangers to him, but at 
the moment Dawes thought of 
them as old friends, friends for 
whose companionship he had 
longed for months and years. 

They stopped again a short 
time later. Again, it was Carol. 
She threw herself down on the 
ground, sobbing, muttering little 
senseless sounds. 

Noonan scooped her up. Dawes 
hung back, even though techni- 
cally she was his wife. She would 
have to be carried, and he had 
barely enough strength to carry 
himself along. Therefore, Noonan 
would have to carry her. It was as 
simple as that. Dawes made no 
protest as Noonan picked her 



up and cradled her roughly in 
his arms. 

“We’re almost there,” Noonan 
told them. “I’ll carry her the rest 
of the way. You two all right?” 
“I’ll make it,” Cherry said. “If 
I don’t freeze first, that is.” 

“You, Dawes?” 

“I’m okay.” 

“Let’s go, then.” 

Step after step after step; and 
every step, Dawes told himself 
sternly, brought him that much 
closer to the colony, to food and 
warmth and clothing. Unless, of 
course, Noonan had been leading 
them in the wrong direction all 
this time. That might be. No, 
Dawes argued; the cliffs were still 
at their backs, and so they had 
to be going in the right direction. 
His tired mind thought up cold 
fantasies: suppose the aliens had 
been following them all this time, 
maliciously feeding on their suf- 
fering, and planned to massacre 
them as they stood within sight 
of the stockade? Or perhaps the 
stockade itself would be empty, 
all of the colonists dead or cap- 
tured, leaving Dawes and Carol, 
Noonan and Cherry as the sole 
population of Osiris? 

He shook away the thoughts 
and kept going. Abruptly they 
emerged into a clearing. 

“Take a look,” Noonan said ex- 
ultantly. 

The stockade was a hundred 
yards ahead of them. 



186 



GALAXY 



XVII 



¥ TNSHEATHED gunsnouts 
greeted them as they ap- 
peared, footsore, dirty, chilled, at 
the colony stockades. The gun- 
barrels came snaking out of spy- 
holes in the wall; the colonists 
were on guard now against any 
shapes of the forest, it seemed. 

“Take it easy,” Noonan called 
out. “We’re friends. Humans.” 

A voice said distinctly behind 
the stockade, “Christ! Those 
aren’t aliens! It’s — ” 

“They’ve come back!” someone 
else yelled. 

The gunsnouts disappeared. 
The stockade gate creaked open 
and people came rushing out, fa- 
miliar people, friends. Dawes 
recognized Sid Nolan, Dave Mat- 
thews, Matt Zachary, and Lee 
Donaldson. There were a few 
others whose names he could not 
at all remember. 

They dragged the four return- 
ees within, slammed the stockade 
gate shut. As the colonists gath- 
ered to greet them, Dawes for 
the first time became uncomfort- 
ably aware of his nakedness. But 
only for a moment; for Marya 
Brannick appeared with blankets, 
and the wanderers were quickly 
clad. Inquisitive eyes goggled at 
the four weary ones. Questions 
bubbled up. 

“Where were you?” 

“What happened?” 



“How did you get free?” 

Dawes shook all the question- 
ers off. “Where’s Haas?” he asked. 
“We’d better talk to him first.” 

Dave Matthews shook his head 
gravely. “Haas — isn’t here any 
more.” 

“Did the aliens get him?” asked 
Noonan. 

“No. Not the aliens.” 

“Where is he, then?” Dawes 
demanded. 

Matthews shrugged. “We had 
some trouble here, after the aliens 
broke in and kidnapped you. 
Howard Stoker and a couple of 
his buddies thought Haas ought 
to quit as Colony Director. He — 
got killed.” 

“Killed? So Stoker’s in charge 
now?” 

Matthews smiled gloomily. 
“No. There was a — well, a 
counter-revolution, you might call 
it. In the name of law and order 
we executed Stoker, Harris, and 
Hawes. Lee Donaldson’s the Di- 
rector now.” 

“What’s happening to the four 
surplus women, if those men are 
dead?” 

“We’re having trouble over 
that,” Matthews admitted. “The 
colony’s kind of split on the sub- 
ject of polygamy right now. But 
we — ” 

“Let our troubles wait till 
later,” Lee Donaldson broke in 
brusquely. “I want to hear about 
these people. Where were you?” 



THE SEED OF EARTH 



187 



“We were taken to a cave in 
one of the cliffs beyond the for- 
est,” Dawes said. “We were 
prisoners. The aliens were keep- 
ing us. But we escaped.” He 
grinned. He felt very tired after 
the forest trek, but yet invigor- 
ated. Tougher, harder. And he 
was saddened to learn that there 
had been dissension in the colony. 

“Did they hurt you?” Donald- 
son asked. 

Dawes thought about that for 
a moment. “No,” he said finally. 
“Not — not physically.” 

TTE looked around. There 
hadn’t been much progress 
in the colony in his absence. It 
still looked bare and hardly be- 
gun. He saw troubled faces. There 
had been bitter quarrelling here, 
he realized. 

“What about the aliens?” he 
asked. “Did they make any fur- 
ther attacks?” 

“No,” Matthews said. “We’ve 
seen them skulking around, out- 
side the stockade. But they 
haven’t tried to break in again. 
We keep a constant patrol, now.” 

“And there’s been trouble here, 
hasn’t there?” 

“Trouble?” 

Dawes nodded. “Argurnents. 
Dissension.” 

Lee Donaldson tightened his 
jaw-muscles tensely. “We’ve had 
some difficulties. Haas was our 
best leader, and he’s dead. It 



hasn’t been so easy to make the 
people work together since Stok- 
er got his big idea. We do more 
arguing than working these days.” 

Dawes sighed. He wanted to 
tell Matthews and Donaldson 
what they had learned in the 
cave, how the aliens thrived vi- 
cariously on strife, how the colo- 
nists would never be completely 
free of the shadowy neckless be- 
ings until they learned to function 
like parts of a well-machined in- 
strument, as a colony must if it 
is to survive. 

But there was time for that 
later, he thought. You didn’t 
make people see things in a 
minute, or in ten minutes. It 
could take days — or forever. But 
there was time to begin healing 
the colony’s wounds later. 

In a way, Dawes thought, it 
was a good thing that the colony 
had something like the aliens 
waiting outside to feed on their 
hate. It would be like having a 
perpetual visible conscience; hate 
would not enter the colony for 
fear of the aliens without. 

He turned away. Suddenly he 
wanted to be alone with himself 
— with the new self that had 
come out of the cave. Something 
had grown with him in those five 
days, and it hadn’t been just the 
silky beard stubbling his cheeks. 
It was something else. 

He understood now why Se- 
lection was necessary, why the 



188 



GALAXY 



seed of Earth had to be carried 
from world to world. It was be- 
cause the stars were there, and 
because it was in the nature of 
man to climb outward, transcend- 
ing himself, changing himself. As 
he had changed; for he had 
changed, in those few catalytic 
days in the cave. 

They had been days of harden- 
ing for him. No longer was he 
filled with vague angry resent- 
ment; no longer did he hate Se- 
lection and all its minions, local 
chairman Brewer and district 
chairman Mulholland. He for- 
gave them. More; he admired 
them, and pitied them because 
they had to stay behind in this 
greatest of all human adventures. 

TN the twilight Dawes walked 
-*■ away from the group, down 
toward the bubble-home he had 
chosen and from which he had 
been taken by the aliens. His 
suitcase and Carol’s still lay half- 
open on the ground. The bubble 
hadn’t been entered since the 
night of the kidnapping. 

Shrugging out of the blanket, 
he took spare clothing from his 
suitcase and dressed slowly. He 
stood for a long time, thinking. 
They would none of them be the 
same any more — not Noonan, 
who for the first time in his life 
had run into a problem he could 
not solve with his fists, or' Carol, 
who had gone into the cave a 



virgin and 'come out otherwise, 
or Cherry, whose metal shell had 
broken open to give him a mo- 
ment of tenderness that he had 
mistaken for a betrayal. 

But Dawes knew that he had 
changed most of all, and yet not 
changed. The thing that was in- 
side him, the curiosity, the seek- 
ing mind — now, it was alive and 
truly working for the first time. 
How wrong it had been to dream 
of that cozy, dead existence in 
his nice Ohio home with his nice 
Ohio wife and his nice Ohio chil- 
dren! He realized now that he 
wanted to get out into the wilder- 
ness and see the aliens again, find 
out why they were the way they 
were, what they had wanted from 
the prisoners in the cave, how 
they had taken it, what they were 
really like. Osiris held a million 
mysteries. And through the mir- 
acle of Selection he had been put 
here to solve them. 

I’m different now. 

It was a hard fact to assimilate. 
He realized with a jolt, looking at 
Carol’s suitcase, that she was still 
his wife. He didn’t want her any 
more. The boy Mike Dawes had 
been taken by her innocence and 
shyness, but that boy no longer 
existed. And he needed someone 
more solid, someone who could 
share problems with him instead 
of simply clinging dependently. 

Someone was knocking out-

“Come on in,” Dawes said. 

It was Cherry. 

She looked flustered and con- 
fused. “You just walked away 
from everybody like that,” she 
said. “You feeling okay, Mike?” 

“I just wanted to think. I had 
to be by myself for a little while. 
I’m okay.” 

She was looking at him earnest- 
ly; glancing away, she saw the 
two suitcases. 

“Carol’s with Noonan,” she 
said. 

“I figured as much,” said 
Dawes without a trace of a quiver 
in his voice. “I don’t care. Really, 
I don’t.” 

TT was funny, he thought, how 
lousy deals turned out to be 
the biggest things in your life. 
Being picked by the lottery, and 
then being grabbed by the aliens 
on top of that. And losing your 
girl to a man like Noonan. And 
none of it mattered — each loss 
was a find, each finish a begin- 
ning. 

An animal honked in the forest, 
and Dawes grinned. A whole 
world lay out there beyond the 
stockade, waiting to have its se- 
crets pried open in the years to 
come. 

And he’d do it. 



He said, “If Noonan’s with 
Carol — where are you going 
to stay. Cherry?” 

“I haven’t figured that out yet.” 

He smiled. Carol had left her 
suitcase here, but nothing else. 
If Noonan could be happy with 
her, let him be. 

Cherry stepped forward awk- 
wardly. Dawes wanted to tell her 
that he forgave her and loved 
her and needed her, and that he 
saw through her toughness and 
through the scars life had left on 
her. But he couldn’t say any of 
those things out loud, and he 
realized he wasn’t finished grow- 
ing up, quite yet. She would help 
him, though. And he would help 
her. 

Funny. Getting picked in the 
lottery had seemed like the end 
of the world to him, once. But he 
couldn’t have been wronger., 

He smiled at Cherry. The girl 
before him was like a stranger, 
even after the days in the cave. 
Everything was oddly brand new. 
He tipped her face up the inch 
or two that separated them in 
height, and kissed her, listening 
to the wind of the alien world — 
his world. 

“Hello,” she said tenderly. 

“Hello,” he said.

TTAVING BEEN weaned on 
science fiction back in 1928 
. “Doc” Smith’s history-making 
Skylark of Space was the mar- 
velous epic that ensnared me . 
I have seen the transition of SF 
from the original crude gimmick 
yarn to today’s polished story of 
ideas. 

I have seen countless new au- 
thors appear and prolific authors 
vanish from the field without 
trace. (Recent reprinting of 
Drums of Tapajos solved the 
mysterious disappearance of Capt. 
S. P. Meek.) 



Individual stories have ex- 
ploded like H-bombs inducing 
radical mutations in story genes 
by their fallout. A few of the 
many prime examples: Skylark; 
Weinbaum’s A Martian Odyssey; 
Charles Cloukey’s Paradox; 
Stuart-Campbell’s Forgetfulness; 
Leinster’s Sidewise in Time; Van 
Vogt’s Sian; Pohl-Kornbluth’s 
Gravy Planet, alias The Space 
Merchants.

frontiers have disappeared. Thir-

Air Wonder Stories. Today’s 
super-sonic jets and X-15s leave 
little to expect from really radical 
changes in powered flight within 
our atmosphere. 

But thirty years ago, the deep 
of Ocean was, and remains still, 
a frontier of mystery and peril. 
Although we are plumbing its 
depths with super-subs and bath- 
yscaphes, and descending our- 
selves unarmored except for scu- 
ba gear, the human mind still 
remains horrified by the fear of 
gradual suffocation or slow death 
in an alien environment. 

It is one of the strange quirks 
of human psychology that an in- 
tense empathy is aroused by a 
tragedy of duration. Unfortunate- 
ly, this sense of oneness is unaf- 
fected by large scale misfortune. 
It becomes activated by an en- 
trapment, usually of a child in a 
well, a Floyd Collins in a Ken- 
tucky cave, a miner deep in a 
shaft, and is usually limited in 
scope. The strange emotion is 
barely aroused by, say, the plight 
of millions of sufferers in Nazi 
concentration camps or political 
prisoners anywhere in the world. 
But millions will hang on the 
moment-to-moment efforts of res- 
cuers to free a single individual. 
In this mood, one of the real pros 
of our league, Arthur C. Clarke, 
has penned a yarn so persuasive 
and convincing that reader identi- 
fication is inescapable. 



The yarn is emotionally grip- 
ping, astute in choice of locale, 
solution of technical and emo- 
tional problems . and so his- 
torically correct that it measures 
up to the very highest standard 
of his previous efforts. No praise 
can be higher. It demonstrates his 
skill at capturing a fantastic sit- 
uation realistically. 

A FALL OF MOONDUST by 
Arthur C. Clarke. Harcourt, 
Brace and World. 

AT FIRST glance, shipwreck on 
the moon seems grade-A fantasy. 
Clarke, though, has developed a 
scientifically conceivable situa- 
tion; a tourist boat, propelled by 
“fans,” a-sail on a surface of im- 
palpable dust so fine that it has 
most of the characteristics (all 
the bad ones) of a liquid. What 
would happen if said boat found- 
ered? asks Clarke; and proceeds 
to introduce all sorts of fascina- 
ting and deadly problems. Though 
the dust can flow like water to 
seek its own level, its resistance 
is so high that it cannot be 
pumped, effectively eliminating 
escape-hatch and spacesuit rescue. 
What about survival problems of 
the trapped victims: oxygen, 

water and food, morale? The tre- 
mendous technical dilemmas fac- 
ing the rescuers who at first can’t 
even locate the wreck with their 
enormously efficient instruments?

STRANGER IN A STRANGE 
LAND by Robert A. Heinlein. 
G. P. Putnam’s Sons. 

ROBERT A. HEINLEIN has 
made his living from the future 
but his occupation is not complete 
preoccupation. He has become in- 
creasingly concerned with the 
state of the world today and has 
exercised author’s privilege in 
mounting degree to expound from 
his lectern. 

In his just-previous Starship 
Troopers, he expressed his dis- 
satisfaction with our present sys- 
tem of strewing the rights and 
privileges of citizenship indiscrim- 
inately with a corresponding 
cheapening of its value. The 
story’s proposed solution was to 
make citizenship contingent upon 
an honorable tour of duty in the 
armed forces. Theoretically, after 
the hardships of service life, it 
would .sc'em that intellectual and 
political maturity would be a 
natural r«\sult. But such a happy 
conclusion is highly problemati- 
cal, considering the orientation of 
our |ires<Mit crop of Big Brass. In 
that book, plot-stopping political 
harangues did fairly little dam- 



age, because the story’s essential 
interest and action far outbal- 
anced the dead weight. 

Stranger in a Strange Land is 
an entirely different colored horse. 
Being social satire with most 
action on a cerebral level, it has 
a heavy load to carry. 

Still, Heinlein is too much a 
pro to write a real stinkeroo. His 
monstrously wealthy bastard he- 
ro, marooned on Mars for all his 
twenty-one years, is sole heir of 
all the dead crew of the first Mar- 
tian expedition and, through legal 
mumbo-jumbo, legal offspring of 
three of them. According to a le- 
gal precedent, he is also sole 
owner of Mars. Returned unwill- 
ingly to Earth, and then only on 
direct order of the utterly alien 
Martian Old Ones by whom he 
was reared. Smith, the Man from 
Mars, constitutes a fundamental 
threat to the stability of the 
World Federation of Free States 
merely by the fact of his exist- 
ence. Placed in dubious protective 
custody by direct order of the 
Secretary-General, he is whisked 
to safety by an idealistic and 
gorgeously endowed nurse and 
proceeds to become a pawn in 
power politics. His haven is the 
weird domicile of an Old School 
rugged individual, a doctor-law- 
yer-writer and his trio of luscious 
secretary-cook-companions. 

Heinlein expounds his philoso- 
phy through the mouth of the leg-

al-medical-literary pundit who 
pontificates in a too-cute way; 
impudent, brash, irritating but 
detestably lovable ... in the 
manner of a gruff old dog who 
gums you to death. 

Smith, as completely ignorant 
of human customs as an utter 
alien, must be taught everything, 
from tying shoelaces to the joys 
of sexual union. Needless to say, 
the quartet of beauties are all- 
around teachers. His Martian 
teachers, however, had taught 
him levitation, telepathy, slowing 
of the time sense, teleportation, 
disco'rporation of enemies, articles 
or self and also that food must not 
be wasted. People are protein, 
protein is food; and with the 
severe shortage on Mars, bodies 
of the Old Ones are shared by 
their friends in a ritual of love 
and devotion. 

Smith, therefore is a human 
superman with a completely alien 
outlook and set of mores. His 
champion, detestably lovable 
Harshaw, is such a wing-ding in 
everything he does that the legal- 
istic battle between him and the 
Secretary-General is hardly fair; 
he can’t lose. His legal maneuver- 
ings are amusing, but the subse- 
quent incognito wanderings of 
Smith to savor our culture are 
peculiarly uninspired and lacking 
in interest. Harshaw’s previous 
C5mical comments have caused 
Heinlein to gloss over an oppor- 



tunity to observe and evaluate 
our society through Smith’s eyes. 

Smith’s solution to our prob- 
lems is the elimination of jealousy 
by formation of a quasi-religious 
order that emphasizes the sharing 
of self. Hence the scathing de- 
nunciation by many “main- 
stream” reviewers — notably the 
New York Times — of the book’s 
accent on sex. Of course, the 
Times cannot be expected to re- 
member the recent past when 
space ships needed no sanitary 
facilities and science-fictional 
characters owned no sexual or- 
gans. However, the book’s short- 
comings lie not so much in its 
emancipation as in the fact that 
Heinlein has bitten off too large 
a chewing portion. But kudos to 
him for the decision to write what 
he thinks.

THE PAPERS OF ANDREW 
MELMOTH by Hugh Sykes 
Davies. William Morrow & Co. 

RATS BEING the objects of 
horror and loathing to many 
people, it is no surprise that 
masters of the macabre, including 
Lovecraft and Kuttner, have 
woven tales of pure shiver about 
them. Davies, an Oxford don, has 
written an understated and gen- 
teel yarn that carries a shock.
