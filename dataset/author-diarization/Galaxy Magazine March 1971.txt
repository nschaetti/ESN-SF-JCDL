SPECIAL WONDER 

The Anthony Boucher Me- 
morial Anthology of Fantasy 
and Science Fiction 

As editor, writer, critic and 
friend, Anthony Boucher af- 
fected the lives of a consid- 
erable number of people. 

When he died in 1968, some 
of them decided to create a 
unique memorial— twin an- 
thologies of the kinds of 
stories he had been most closely identified with. 
Beagle Books is proud to publish the paperback 
reprints of these antholoqies, beginning with 
SPECIAL WONDER. 

Vol. 1: Stories by Poul Anderson, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, R. 
Bretnor, Grendel Briarton, Fredric Brown, John Brunner, Doris Pitkin 
Buck, Mildred Clingerman, Avram Davidson, Jon De Cles, Miriam 
Allen DeFord, Richard Deming, Gordon R. Dickson, Harlan Ellison, 
Philip Jos6 Farmer. 

Vol. 2: Stories by Horace B. Fyfe, Randall Garrett, Damon Knight, Kris 
Neville, William F. Nolan, Alan E. Nourse, Chad Oliver, Mack Reynolds, 
Margaret St. Clair, Howard Schoenfeld, Robert Silverberg, Jack 
Vance, Richard Wilson. 

We will also publish shortly the companion anthology, CRIMES AND 
MISFORTUNES, containing stories by Queen, Stout, Carr, and 
twenty-six other top mystery writers. Like SPECIAL WONDER, it will 
appear in two volumes. 

950 each wherever paperback books are sold.

AFTER SEX - WHAT ? 



an editorial message from 

THEODORE STURGEON 



B ECAUSE everything, if you 
care to have it so, occurs on 
more levels than one and, if you 
like, everything can be a symbol 
or an analogue of other things, 1 
shall answer the above as if it were 
a straight question, partly to get it 
out of the way of the other levels, 
and partly to share with you a 
great illumination. It was pivotal 
with me when it came to me some 
time ago. May it be the same to 
you. 

To most of us, for most of our 
lives, the marvelous experience of 
sex is an arrival point, a place well 
worth all the thought and care and 
effort it takes to get there; to meet 
and to be met and to give and 
receive the joy of the meeting. Yet 
loo few of us seem to understand 
that the occasion can be a point of 
departure a place like an airport; 
and where you can go from there 
depends solely on your resources 
and the time you are willing to give 
to it. Eor a good many years I, with 
most of my co-passengers on the 
spaceship Earth, made my 
appointments and hurried to get 
there on time, bringing her with me 
to that special place, and once we 



had done our thing — turned around 
and went home, never passing 
through the gateway we had 
reached. 

On the other side of that gate is 
the country I now call Afterward, 
and it is the only land in which you 
can find out just who it is you are 
with without the daz/.lement of 
sex. Just as you shed your clothes 
to gel there, you shed the pressures 
of arrival and meeting; and in that 
new nakedness and undiluted 
awareness you may commune 
with the other human being as a 
human being a condition which 
will last as long as your ful- 
filled/exhausled endocrine system 
will permit. It is at this time of all 
times when you must, il'you care to 
enrich yourself, pay special atten- 
tion to the one you’re with. You'll 
find Afterward a surprising and 
richly rewarding place in which to 
be. Do you recall the scene in 
Stranger in a Strange Land when 
the innocent superman Mike first 
discovered girls, and kissed one? 
She was a highly sophisticated 
girl, but she fainted dead away. 
Her mentor, old Jubul, was 
fascinated by this and asked her

Do you have 
the “faults” 
that could mean 
you were born 
to be a writer? 



V 



Writers usually hate to be “labeled,” but 
there’s no denying most of them share 
certain characteristics. They’re dreamers. 
Loners. Bookworms. Too impractical, in- 
tense, idealistic. If you have “faults” like 
these, remember they may be the most cre- 
ative parts of your personality. They could 
be a clear indication of a gift. 

If you have such a gift, make the most 
of it. Hours you may be spending in time- 
killing diversions could be spent in produc- 
tive recreation. In the writer’s world, you 
can let your imagination roam free, doing 
what comes naturally to you. 

A unique writing school 

But where do you begin? It’s really very 
simple— we teach; you learn. Here at Famous 
Writers School, we’ve created a truly un- 
usual writing program that comes to you— 
right in your home. The program shortens 
the years of trial-and-error; helps you avoid 
the failures of so many beginning writers. 
It’s more like a shared adventure than a 
course. 



find the kind of line-by-line editing estab- 
lished writers get from their own editors— 
plus a detailed letter of suggestions. No one 
can promise success. But with training like 
this, our students have sold to over 700 
publications. 

Think about it. Could you convert your 
“faults” into a gift for writing? Find out by

why, and she said, very thought- 
fully, “I think it’s because, when 
Mike kisses you, he isn't doing 
anything else! m - Man insight for

grateful to Robert Heinlein. Apply 
it to your sex life and you'll 
discover a texture you have never

travels in Afterward and you'll 
learn things about yourself and 
others, and about love, and about

Think this over when you think it’s 
time to roll over and go to sleep. It 
may not be. 

Which brings me to my main 
subject just now, which is sex in 
literature. (“Literature” as I use it 
here means stage and boobtube 
and cinema as well as the printed 
word.) Friends, it’s been a great 
fight, but it’s over. It's won. At 
long last we can say what we want, 
see what we want, when and where 
we want to. I think this is intrinsi- 
cally good, for it isn't easy to 
frighten an informed person, and 
guilt is just one of the faces of 
fear. We have (providing we are 
careful not to let the pendulum 
swing back) wave after wave of 
new readers and thinkers and view- 
ers on the way who will grow up 
without the sniggering mysteries 
which have plagued us for genera- 
tions. People will, I think, grow up 
doing what they say they're doing, 
instead of denying it — the word is 
lying. Truthtelling is a habit-form- 
ing practice, and it might be possi- 



ble for a future cultural historian 
to trace, in this new freedom, the 
beginnings of a morality based on 
honesty instead of on the kind of 
self-denial which breeds the lie, the 
“crimes without victims," the 
“secret vice," the policing of pri- 
vate practices and beautiful urges, 
and all the other maggots which 
have for so long embedded 
themselves in our mortified 
humanity. And freedom of sexual 
speech places a fine strong new 
support under the foundations of 
that greatest of our strengths — the 
freedom of all speech. This above 
all is why the fight has been a good 
fight and the victory a great one. 
We have an interim period to go 
through, of course, while it's all so 
new, where filth will proliferate. 
Let it. In literature the good does, 
in the long run, drive out the bad, if 
only by outlasting it. The 
beautifully written, courageous, 
and carefully thought out Lady 
Chatterly will long outlive any 
two-dollar paperback called 
Gangbang Gal. Let 'em come, let 
'em pass. Strong sunlight shrivels 
them up. 

But listen: this battle is won. 
Writers and would-be writers who, 
now that they can’t run any risk, 
wallow in explicit sex and “shock- 
ing" language, dilute both the sex 
and the shock and exhibit what is 
after all the only really evil thing 
there is, which is Excess. (There is 
no such thing as a poisonous sub-

I 

I AM Kinnall Darival and I mean 
to tell you all about myself. 

That statement is so strange to 
me that it screams in my eyes. 1 
look at it on the page and 1 recog- 
nize the hand as my own, narrow 
upright red letters on the coarse 
gray sheet. I see my name and I 
hear in my mind the echoes of the 
brain-impulse that hatched those 
words. 

/ am Kinnall Darival and I mean 
to tell you all about myself. 
Incredible. 

This is to be what the Earthman 
Schweiz would call an “auto- 
biography.” Which means an ac- 
count of one's self and deeds, writ- 
ten by one’s own self. It is not a 
literary form that we understand in 
our world. I must invent my own 
method of narrative as 1 go, for I 
have no precedents to guide me. 
But this is as it should be. On this 
my planet I stand alone, now. In a 
sense I have invented a new way of 
life; I can surely invent a new sort 
of literature. 

They have always told me 1 have 
a gift for words. 

So I find myself in a clapboard 
shack in the Burnt Lowlands, writ- 
ing obscenities as I wait for death 
and praising myself for my liter- 
ary gifts. 

I am Kinnall Darival. 

Obscene! Obscene! Already on 
this one sheet 1 have used the pro- 
noun “I” close to twenty times, it 



seems. While also casually drop- 
ping such words as “my,” “me,” 
“myself," more often than I care to 
count. A torrent of shamelessness. 
I I I I I. If I exposed my manhood 
in the Stone Chapel of Manneran 
on Naming Day 1 would be doing 
nothing so foul as I am doing here. 
I could almost laugh. Kinnall 
Darival practicing a solitary vice. 
In this miserable lonely place he 
massages his stinking ego and 
shrieks offensive pronouns into 
the hot wind, hoping they will sail 
on the gusts and soil his fellow 
men. He sets down sentence after 
sentence in the naked syntax of 
madness. He would, if he could, 
seize you by the wrist and pour 
cascades of filth into your unwill- 
ing ear. And why? Is proud Dari- 
val in fact insane? Is nothing left 
but the shell of him, sitting in this 
dreary hut, obsessively titillating 
himself with disreputable language, 
muttering “I” and “me” and “my” 
and “myself,” blearily threatening 
to reveal the intimacies of his soul? 

No. It is Darival who is sane and 
all of you who are sick, and though 
I know how mad that sounds, 1 will 
let it stand. I am no lunatic. I have 
passed through a time of changes 
and 1 have been healed of the 
sickness that affects those who 
inhabit my world, and in writing 
what I intend to write I hope to 
heal you as well, though I know 
you are on your way into the Burnt 
Lowlands to slay me for my hopes. 

So be it.

GALAXY 




I am Kinnall Darival and I mean 
to tell you all about myself. 

L INGERING vestiges of the cus- 
toms against which I rebel still 
plague me. Perhaps you can begin 
to comprehend what an effort it is 
for me to frame my sentences in 
this style, to twist my verbs around 
in order to fit the first-person 
construction. 1 have been writing 
ten minutes and my body is cov- 
ered with sweat, not the hot sweat 
of the burning air about me but the 
dank, clammy sweat of mental 
struggle. I know the style I must 
use but the muscles of my arm re- 
bel against me, and fight to put 
down the words in the old fashion, 
saying. One has been writing for 
ten minutes and one's body is cov- 
ered with sweat . saying, One 
has passed through a time of 
changes, and he has been healed of 
the sickness that affects those who 
inhabit his world. 1 suppose that 
much of what I have written could 
have been phrased in the old way 
and no harm done; but I do battle 
against the self-effacing grammar 
of my world and, if I must, I will 
joust with my own muscles for the 
right to arrange my words 
according to my present manner of 
philosophy. 

In any case, however my former 
habits trick me into misconstruct- 
ing my sentences, my meaning will 
blaze through the screen of words. 

I may say, “1 am Kinnall Darival 
and I mean to tell you all about 



myself.” Or I may say, “One’s 
name is Kinnall Darival and he 
means to tell you all about him- 
self.” But there is no real differ- 
ence. Either way, the content of 
Kinnall Darival’s statement is — by 
your standards, by the standards I 
would destroy — disgusting, con- 
temptible, obscene. 

A LSO I am troubled, at least in 
these early pages, by the identi- 
ty of my audience. I assume, be- 
cause I must, that I will have read- 
ers. But who are they? Who are 
you? Men and women of my na- 
tive planet, perhaps, furtively 
turning my pages by torchlight, 
dreading the knock at the door? 
Or maybe otherworlders, reading 
for amusement, scanning my book 
for the insight it may give into an 
alien and repellent society? 1 have 
no idea. I can establish no easy 
relationship with you, my unknown 
reader. When I first conceived my 
plan of setting down my soul on 
paper, I thought it would be 
simple, a mere confessional, 
nothing but an extended session 
with an imaginary drainer who 
would listen endlessly and at last 
give me absolution. But now I 
realize I must take another 
approach. If you are not of my 
world -or if you are of my world 
but not of my time— -you may find 
much that is incomprehensible 
here. 

Therefore I must explain. Pos- 
sibly I will explain too much and

drive you off by pounding you with 
the obvious. Forgive me if I in- 
struct you in what you already 
know. Forgive me if my tone and 
mode of attack show lapses of 
consistency and I seem to be 
addressing myself to someone 
else. For you will not hold still for 
me, my unknown reader. You wear 
many faces for me. Now I see the 
crooked nose of Jidd the drainer, 
now the suave smile of my bond- 
brother Noim Condorit, and now 
the silkiness of my bondsister 
Halum — and now you become the 
tempter Schweiz of pitiful Earth, 
now you are my son's son's son's 
son’s son, not to be born for a 
cluster of years and eager to know 
what manner of man your ances- 
tor was— and now you are some 
stranger of a different planet, to 
whom we of Borthan are 
grotesque, mysterious and baffling. 
1 do not know you, so 1 will be 
clumsy in my attempts to talk to 
you. 

But, by Salla’s Gate, before I am 
done you will know me as no man 
of Borthan has ever been known by 
others before! 

I AM a man of middle years. 

Thirty times since the day of my 
birth has Borthan traveled around 
our golden-green sun, and on our 
world a man is considered old if he 
has lived through fifty such cir- 
cuits, while the most ancient man 
of whom I ever heard died just 
short of his eightieth. From this 



you may be able to calculate our 
spans in terms of yours, if other- 
worlder you happen to be. The 
Earthman Schweiz claimed an age 
of forty-three years by his planet’s 
reckoning, yet he seemed no older 
than I. 

My body is strong. Here I shall 
commit a double sin, for not only 
shall I speak of myself without 
shame, but I shall show pride and 
pleasure in my physical self. 1 am 
tall: a woman of normal height 
reaches barely to the lower vault of 
my chest. My hair is dark and long, 
falling to my shoulders. Lately 
streaks of gray have appeared in it 
and likewise in my beard, which is 
full and thick, covering much of my 
face. My nose is prominent and 
straight, with a wide bridge and 
large nostrils; my lips are fleshy 
and give me, so it is said, a look of 
sensuality; my eyes are deep brown 
in hue and are set somewhat far 
apart in my skull. They have, I am 
given to understand, the 
appearance of the eyes of one who 
has been accustomed all his life to 
commanding other men. 

My back is broad and my chest 
is deep. A dense mat of coarse dark 
hair , grows nearly everywhere on 
me. My arms are long. My hands 
are large. My muscles are well 
developed and stand out promi- 
nently beneath my skin. I move 
gracefully for a man my size, with 
smooth coordination; I excel in 
sports and when I was younger I 
hurled the feathered shaft the en-

tire length of Manneran Stadium, a 
feat that had never been achieved 
until then. 

Women generally find me 
attractive. Certainly the political 
power 1 have held in my time has 
helped to bring many partners to 
my couch, but no doubt they were 
drawn to me as much by the look 
of my body as by anything more 
subtle. Most of them have been 
disappointed in me. Bulging 
muscles and a hairy hide do not a 
skilled lover make. I am no 
champion of copulation. See: 1 
hide nothing from you. There is in 
me a certain constitutional 
impatience that expresses itself 
outwardly only during the carnal 
act -I find myself swiftly swept 
away, and rarely can I sustain the 
deed until the woman’s pleasure 
comes. To no one, not even a 
drainer, have I confessed this 
failing before, nor did 1 ever ex- 
pect that 1 would. But I place it on 
the record here, for perspective’s 
sake. I would not have you think of 
me as a hairy, mighty giant without 
your also knowing how often my 
flesh has betrayed my lusts. 
Possibly this failing of mine was 
among the forces that shaped my 
destinies toward this day in the 
Burnt Lowlands, and you should 
know of that. 

M Y FATHER was hereditary 
septarch of the province of Sal- 
la on our eastern coast. My mother 
was daughter to a septarch of Glin; 



he met her on a diplomatic 
mission. The first child born to 
them was my brother Stirron, now 
septarch of Salla in our father’s 
place. I followed two years later; 
there were three more after me, all 
of them girls. Two of these still 
live. My youngest sister was slain 
by raiders from Glin some twenty 
moontimes ago. 

I knew my father poorly. On 
Borthan everyone is a stranger to 
everyone, but one’s father is cus- 
tomarily less remote from one than 
others; not so with the old sep- 
tarch. Between us lay an impene- 
trable wall of formality. In ad- 
dressing him we used the same 
formulas of respect that subjects 
employed. His smiles were so 
infrequent that I think I can recall 
each one. Once, and it was 
unforgettable, he took me up 
beside him on his rough-hewn 
blackwood throne, let me touch the 
ancient yellow cushion and called 
me fondly by my child-name; it 
was the day my mother died. 
Otherwise he ignored me. I feared 
and loved him and crouched 
trembling behind pillars in his 
court to watch him dispense justice, 
thinking that if he saw me there he 
would have me destroyed — yet I 
was unable to deprive myself of the 
sight of my father in his majesty. 

He was, oddly, a man of slender 
body and modest height, over 
whom my brother and I towered 
even when we were boys. But there 
was a terrible strength of will in

11 




him that led him to surmount every 
challenge. Once in my childhood 
there came some ambassador to 
the septarchy, a hulking sun- 
blackened westerner who stands in 
my memory no smaller than 
Kongoroi Mountain; probably he 
was as tall and broad as 1 am now. 
At feasting-time the ambassador 
let too much blue wine down his 
throat and said before my father 
and his courtiers and his family, 
“One would show his strength to 
the men of Salla, to whom he may 
be able to leach something of 
wrestling.” 

"“There is one here," my father 
replied in sudden fury, “to whom, 
perhaps, nothing need be taught." 

“Let him be produced,” the 
huge westerner said, rising and 
peeling back his cloak. But my 
father, smiling and the sight of 
that smile made his courtiers 
quake told the boastful stranger 
it would not be fair to make him 
compete while his mind was fogged 
with wine. This, of course, mad- 
dened the ambassador beyond 
words. The musicians came in then 
to ease the tension, but the anger of 
our visitor did not subside and, 
after an hour, when the 
drunkenness had lifted somewhat 
from him, he demanded again to 
meet my father’s champion. No 
man of Salla, said our guest, would 
be able to withstand his might. 

Whereupon the septarch said, “1 
will wrestle you myself.” 

That night my brother and 1 



were sitting at the far end of the 
long table, among the women. 
Down from the throne-end came 
the stunning word “I" in my 
father’s voice, and an instant later 
came “myself.” These were 
obscenities that Stirron and I had 
often whispered, sniggering, in the 
darkness of our bedchamber, but 
we had never imagined we would 
hear them hurled forth in the 
feasting-hall from the septarch’s 
own lips. In our shock we reacted 
differently, Stirron jerking 
convulsively and knocking over his 
goblet, myself letting loose a half- 
suppressed shrill giggle of 
embarrassment and delight that 
earned me an instant slap from a 
lady-in-waiting. My laughter was 
merely the mask for my inner 
horror. 1 could barely believe that 
my father knew those words, let 
alone that he would say them 
before this august company. / will 
wrestle you myself. And while the 
reverberations of the forbidden 
forms of speech still dizzied me, 
my father swiftly stepped forward, 
dropping his cloak, and faced the 
great hulk of an ambassador, 
closed with him, caught him by one 
elbow and one haunch in a deft 
Sallan hold and sent him almost 
immediately toppling to the 
polished floor of gray stone. The 
ambassador uttered a terrible cry. 
One of his legs was sticking 
strangely out at a frightening an- 
gle from his hip and in pain and 
humiliation he pounded the flat of

his hand again and again against 
the floor. Perhaps diplomacy is 
practiced in more sophisticated 
ways now in the palace of my bro- 
ther Stirron. 

T HE septarch died when I was 
twelve and just coming into the 
first rush of my manhood. I was 
near his side when death took him. 
To escape the time of rains in Sal- 
la he would go each year to hunt 
the hornfowl in the Burnt Low- 
lands, in the very district where 
now I hide and wait. 1 had never 
gone with him, but on this occa- 
sion I was permitted to accom- 
pany the hunting party, for now 1 
was a young prince and must learn 
the skills of my class. Stirron, as a 
future septarch, had other skills to 
master; he remained behind as 
regent in our father's absence from 
the capital. 

Under a bleak and heavy sky 
bowed with rainclouds the expedi- 
tion of some twenty groundcars 
rolled westward out of Salla City 
and through the flat, sodden, win- 
ter-bare countryside. The rains 
were merciless that year, knifing 
away the precious, sparse topsoil 
and laying bare the rocky bones of 
our province. Everywhere the 
farmers were repairing their dikes 
but to no avail. I could see the 
swollen rivers running yellow- 
brown with Salla's lost wealth and 
I nearly wept to think of such 
treasure being carried into the sea. 
As we came into West Salla the

WE'RE off to a fine start for the 
Spring season (you remember our 
Spring runs from February through 
July) with a Lovecraft celebration, 
to wit: THE DOOM THAT CAME TO 
SARNATH (with Lin Carter's usual 
perspicacious Introduction), plus 
FUNGI FROM YUGGOTH (now that 
ought to really grab the natural food 
bunch) and Other Poems, plus a re- 
issue of our old SURVIVOR and 
Others, by Lovecraft and August Der- 
leth (these are the unfinished works 
that Derleth completed). Plus Bea- 
gle has a whole raft more. All the cov- 
ers are stomach-whirlers. This is re- 
ally a pretty big month for fantasy. 
Besides SARNATH, Lin has another 
in the Adult series, THE BOATS OF 
THE "GLEN CARRIG," by William 
Hope Hodgson— a rare goodie— cov- 
er after Hieronymus Bosch. The 
Sales Department says that our Ori- 
ental fantasia (THE SHAVING OF 
SHAGPAT, George Meredith) isn't 
selling as well as all the other glori- 
ous fantasies. Either there's a 
bunch of racists out there or people 
don't know it's a fantasy because 
there aren't any weirdo animals on 
the cover. There's a man with a tur- 
ban and a couple of sexy females, in 
a Persian sort of way. Buy. 

ALSO in the month of February we'll 



13 





be doing two James White novels: 
one on his favorite theme— the medi- 
cal world of outerspace— titled MA- 
JOR OPERATION, and TOMOR- 
ROW IS TOO FAR, a new area for 
White, but done with his usual metic- 
ulous, logical detail— all the more 
impressive because it makes things 
seem so damn believable. Other 
delights which may have been over- 
looked in the past several tempestu- 
ous months— ON WITH THE WIND, 
by (who else?). Martha Mitchell, a 
companion piece to THE WISDOM 
OF SPIRO T. AGNEW. It's a dol- 
lar— yell for it in bookstores. We 
have, of course, any number of books 
on the environment, ecology, style 
of life, etcetera— so many now that 
you really need to write in for a 
catalog. If you buy the lot, you'll 
know it all. Don't miss Paul Ehr- 
lich's latest, HOW TO BE A SURVI- 
VOR. (That was a special, in Janu- 
ary— ought to be on the stands right 
about now.)

THIS month we start a new publish- 
ing venture— Comstock Editions. Out 
on the West Coast, books all about 
regional areas for history buffs and 
anyone hooked on nostalgia — Feb- 
ruary titles; MOONTRAP, by DON 
Berry— a man who tried to trap the 
moonshine on a stream— and COM- 
MITTEE OF VIGILANCE, by 
George Stewart, which proves that 
things weren't all that bloody good in 
the old days either. BB 



narrow road began to climb the 
foothills of the Huishtor range and 
soon we were in drier, colder 
country, where the skies gave snow, 
not rain, and the trees were mere 
bundles of sticks against the 
blinding whiteness. Up we went 
into the Huishtors, following the 
Kongoroi road. 

The countryfolk came out to 
chant welcomes to the septarch as 
he passed. Now the naked moun- 
tains stood like purple teeth rip- 
ping the gray sky and even in our 
sealed groundcars we shivered, al- 
though the beauty of this tem- 
pestuous place took my mind from 
my discomforts. Here great flat 
shields of striated tawny rock 
flanked the rugged road and there 
was scarcely any soil at all, nor did 
trees or shrubs grow except in 
sheltered places. We could look 
back and see all of Salla like its 
own map below us, the whiteness of 
the western districts, the dark clut- 
ter of the populous eastern shore, 
everything diminished, unreal. I 
had never been this far from home 
before. Though we were now deep 
into the uplands, midway, as it 
were, between sea and sky, the 
inner peaks of the Huishtors still 
lay before us. To my eye they 
formed an unbroken wall of stone 
spanning the continent from north 
to south. Their snow-crowned 
summits jutted raggedly from that 
continuous lofty breastwork of 
bare rock: were we supposed to go 
over the top, or would there be 



14 




some way through? I knew of 
Salla's Gate and that our route lay 
toward it — but somehow the gate 
seemed mere myth to me at that 
moment. 

Up and up and up we rode, until 
the generators of our groundcars 
were gasping in the frosty air and 
we were compelled to pause 
frequently to defrost the power 
conduits and our heads whirled 
from shortness of oxygen. Each 
night we. rested at one of the camps 
maintained for the use of traveling 
septarchs, but the accommoda- 
tions were far from regal and at 
one, where the entire staff of ser- 
vants had perished some weeks be- 
fore in a snowslide, it was neces- 
sary for us to dig our way through 
mounds of ice in order to enter. 
All of us in the party were men of 
the nobility and all of us wielded 
shovels except the septarch him- 
self, for whom manual labor 
would have been sinful. Because I 
was one of the biggest and 
strongest of the men I dug more 
vigorously than anyone and, 
because I was young and rash, 
strained myself beyond my 
strength, collapsing over my shov- 
el and lying half dead in the snow 
for an hour until I was noticed. My 
father came to me while they were 
treating me and smiled one of his 
rare smiles; just then I believed it 
was a gesture of affection and it 
greatly sped my recovery; but 
afterward I came to see it was more 
likely a sign of his contempt. 



That smile buoyed me through 
the remainder of our ascent of the 
Huishtors. No longer did I fret 
about getting over the mountains, 
for I knew that I would, and on the 
far side my father and I would hunt 
the hornfowl in the Burnt Low- 
lands, going out together, guard- 
ing one another from peril, col- 
laborating ultimately on the track- 
ing and on the kill, knowing a 
closeness that had never existed be- 
tween us in my childhood. I talked 
of that one night to my bond- 
brother Noim Condorit, who rode 
with me in my groundcar and who 
was the only person in the universe 
to whom I could say such things. 
“One hopes to be chosen for the 
septarch’s own hunt group,” 1 said. 
“One has reason to think that one 
will be asked. And an end made to 
the distance between father and 
son.” 

“You dream,” said Noim Con- 
dorit. “You live in fantasies.” 

“One could wish,” I replied, “for 
warmer encouragement from one’s 
bondbrother.” 



N OIM was ever a pessimist; I 
took his dourness in stride and 
counted the days to Salla’s Gate. 
When we reached it I was unpre- 
pared for the splendor of the place. 
All morning and half an afternoon 
we had been following a thirty- 
degree grade up the broad breast 
of Kongoroi Mountain, shrouded 
in the shadow of the great double

summit. It seemed to me we would 
climb forever and still have Kon- 
goroi looming over us. Then our 
caravan swung around to the left, 
car after car disappearing behind a 
snowy pylon on the flank of the 
road. Our car's turn came, and 
when we had turned the corner I 
beheld an astonishing sight: a wide 
break in the mountain wall, as if 
some cosmic hand had pried away 
one corner of Kongoroi. Through 
the gap came daylight in a glitter- 
ing burst. 

This was Salla’s Gate, the mi- 
raculous pass across which our an- 
cestors came when first they en- 
tered our province, so many hun- 
dreds of years back, after their 
wanderings in the Burnt Lowlands. 
We plunged joyously into it, riding 
two and even three cars abreast 
over the hardpacked snow— -and 
before we made camp for the night 
we were able to see the strange 
splendor of the Burnt Lowlands 
spread out astonishingly below us. 

All the next day and the one that 
followed we rode the switchbacks 
down Kongoroi’s western slope, 
creeping at a comical pace along a 
road that had little room to spare 
for us: a careless twitch of the stick 
and one’s car would tumble into an 
infinite abyss. Ahead everything 
was red soil. Down into the desert 
we went, quitting winter and 
entering a stifling world where 
every breath tingled in the lungs, 
where dry winds lifted the ground 
in clouds, where odd twisted- 



looking beasts scampered in terror 
from our oncoming cavalcade. On 
the sixth day we reached the 
hunting grounds, a place of ragged 
escarpments far below sea level. I 
am no more than an hour’s ride 
from that place now. Here the 
homfowl have their nests; all day 
long they range the baking plains, 
seeking meat, and at twilight they 
return, collapsing groundward in 
weird spiraling flight to enter their 
all but inaccessible burrows. 

In the dividing of personnel I 
was one of thirteen chosen as the 
septarch’s companions. 

“One shares your joy,’’ Noim 
told me solemnly, and there were 
tears in his eyes as well as in mine, 
for he knew what pain my father's 
coldness had brought me. At 
daybreak the hunt groups set out, 
nine of them, in nine directions. 



T O TAKE a hornfowl near its 
nest is deemed shameful. The 
bird returning is usually laden with 
meat for its young and it therefore 
is clumsy and vulnerable, shorn of 
all its grace and power. Killing one 
as it plummets is no great task, but 
only a craven selfbarer would 
attempt it. ( Selfbarer ! See, how my 
own pen mocks me! I, who have 
bared more self than any ten men 
of Borthan, still unconsciously use 
the term as a word of abuse! But let 
it stand.) I mean to say that the 
virtue in hunting lies in the perils 
and difficulties of the chase, not in 



16 



GALAXY 




the taking of the trophy, and we 
hunt the hornfowl as a challenge 
to our skills, not for its dismal 
flesh. 

Thus hunters go into the open 
Lowlands, where even in winter the 
sun is devastating, where there are 
no trees to give shade or streams to 
ease the thirst. They spread out, 
one man here, two men there, 
taking up stations in that trackless 
expanse of barren red soil, offer- 
ing themselves as the hornfowl’s 
prey. The bird cruises at inconceiv- 
able heights, soaring so far over- 
head that it can be seen only as a 
black scratch in the brilliant dome 
of the sky; it takes the keenest 
vision to detect one, though a horn- 
fowl’s wingspread is twice the 
length of a man’s body. From its 
lofty place the hornfowl scans the 
desert for incautious beasts. No- 
thing, no matter how small, 
escapes its glossy eyes; and when it 
detects good quarry it comes down 
through the turbulent air until it 
hovers house-high above the 
ground. Now it commences its kill- 
ing-flight, flying low, launching it- 
self on a series of savage circles, 
spinning a death-knot around its 
still unsuspecting victim. The first 
swing may sweep over the equiva- 
lent of half a province’s area, but 
each successive circuit is tighter 
and tighter, while acceleration 
mounts, until ultimately the horn- 
fowl has made itself a frightful en- 
gine of death that comes roaring in 
from the horizon at nightmarish 



velocity. Now the quarry learns the 
truth, but it is knowledge not held 
for long: the rustle of mighty 
wings, the hiss of a slim powerful 
form cleaving the hot sluggish air 
^then the single long deadly spear 
sprouting from the bird’s bony 
forehead finds its mark and the 
victim falls, enfolded in the black 
fluttering wings. The hunter hopes 
to bring down his hornfowl while it 
cruises almost at the limits of 
human sight; he carries a weapon 
designed for long-range shooting 
and the test is in the aim, whether 
he can calculate the interplay of 
trajectories at such vast distances. 
The peril of hunting hornfowl is 
this - one never knows if one is the 
hunter or the hunted, for a horn- 
fowl on its killing-flight cannot be 
seen until it strikes its stroke. 

So I went forth. 1 stood from 
dawn to midday. The sun worked 
its will on my winter-pale skin, 
such of it as 1 dared to expose; 
most of me was swaddled in 
hunting clothes of soft crimson 
leather, within which I boiled. We 
were arrayed in a double hexagon 
with my father alone between the 
two groups. Chance had it that 1 
drew the point of my hexagon 
closest to him, but it was more than 
a feathered shaft’s toss from his 
place to mine and all the morning 
long the septarch and 1 exchanged 
not a syllable. He stood with feet 
planted firm, watching the skies, 
his weapon at ready. I, too, studied 
the skies until my eyes ached for it, 



ATIME OF CHANGES 



17 




until I felt twin strands of hot light 
drilling my brain and hammering 
against the back wall of my skull. 
More than once I imagined I saw 
the dark splinter of a hornfowl’s 
shape drifting into view up there, 
and once in sweaty haste 1 came to 
the verge of raising my gun to it, 
which would have brought me 
shame, for one must not shoot un- 
til one has established priority of 
sighting by crying one’s claim. 1 
did not fire, and when 1 blinked 
and opened my eyes 1 saw nothing 
in the sky. The hornfowl seemed to 
be elsewhere that morning. 

A T NOON my father gave a sig- 
Lnal and we spread farther apart 
over the plain, maintaining our 
formation. My new position lay 
atop a low earthen mound in the 
form, almost, of a woman's breast, 
and fear took hold of me as 1 took 
up my place on it. 1 supposed* 
myself to be terribly exposed and 
in imminent peril of hornfowl 
attack. As fright crept through my 
spirit I became convinced that a 
hornfowl was even now flying its 
fatal circuits around my hummock 
and that at any moment its lance 
would pierce my kidneys while 1 
gazed stupidly at the metallic sky. 
The premonition grew so strong 
that I had to struggle to hold my 
ground; I shivered, I stole wary 
peeks over my shoulders, I 
clenched the stock of my gun for 
comfort, I strained my ears for the 
sound of my enemy’s approach, 



hoping to whirl and fire before I 
was speared. For this cowardice 1 
reproached myself severely, even 
offering thanks that Stirron had 
been born before me, since 
obviously I was unfit to succeed to 
the septarchy. I reminded myself 
that not in three years had a hunter 
been killed in this way. I asked 
myself if it were plausible that I 
should die so young, on my first 
hunt, when there were others like 
my father who had hunted for 
thirty seasons and gone unscathed. 
I demanded to know why I felt this 
overwhelming fear, when all my 
tutors had labored to teach me that 
the self is a void and concern for 
one’s person a wicked sin. Was not 
my father in equal jeopardy, far 
across the sun-smitten plain? And 
had he not much more than 1 to 
lose, being a septarch and a prime 
septarch at that, while I was only a 
boy? 

In this way I cudgeled the fear 
from my damp soul and studied the 
sky without regard for the spear 
that might be aimed at my back — 
and in minutes my former fretting 
seemed an absurdity to me. I would 
stand here for days, if need be, 
unafraid. At once 1 had the reward 
of this triumph over self: against 
the shimmering fierceness of the 
sky I made out a dark floating 
form, a notch in the heavens, and 
this time it was no illusion, for my 
youthful eyes spied wings and horn. 
Did the others see it? Was the bird 
mine to attempt? If I made the kill, 



18 



GALAXY 




would the septarch pound my back 
and call me his best son? All was 
silence from the other hunters. 

“One cries claim!" I shouted 
jubilantly and lifted my weapon 
and eyed the sight, remembering 
what I had been taught, to let the 
inner mind make the calculations, 
to aim and fire in one swift impulse 
before the intellect, by quibbling, 
could spoil the intuition's com- 
mand. 

And in the instant before I sent 
my bolt aloft came a ghastly out- 
cry from my left. I fired without 
aiming at all, turning in the same 
instant toward my father’s place 
and seeing him half hidden beneath 
the madly flapping form of anoth- 
er hornfowl that had gored him 
from spine to belly. The air about 
them was clouded with red sand as 
the monster’s wings furiously 
slapped the ground. The bird was 
struggling to take off 1 , but a horn- 
fowl cannot lift a man’s weight, 
though this does not prevent them 
from attacking us. 1 ran to aid the 
septarch. He still was shouting and 
I saw his hands clutching for the 
hornfowl’s scrawny throat, but now 
there was a liquid quality about his 
cries, a bubbling tone, and when 1 
reached the scene — I was the first 
one there- he lay sprawled and 
quiet, the bird still rammed 
through him and covering his body 
like a black cloak. My blade was 
out; I slashed the hornfowl’s neck 
as if it were a length of hose, kicked 
the carcass aside, began to wrench 



desperately at the demonic head 
mounted so hideously upon the 
septarch’s upturned back. Now the 
others came; they pulled me away. 
Someone seized me by the 
shoulders and shook me until my 
fit was past. When I turned to them 
again they closed their ranks to 
keep me from seeing my father’s 
corpse — and then, to my dismay, 
they dropped to their knees before 
me to do homage. 

Homage to me. 

But of course it was Stirron and 
not I who became septarch in 
Salla. His crowning was a grand 
event, for, young though he was, he 
would be the prime septarch of the 
province. Salla’s six other sep- 
tarchs came to the capital — only on 
such an occasion were they ever to 
be found at once in the same 
city — and for a time everything 
was feasting and banners and the 
blare of trumpets. Stirron was at 
the center of it all and I on the mar- 
gins, which was as it should be, 
though it left me feeling more like a 
stableboy than a prince. Once he 
was enthroned, Stirron offered me 
titles and land and power, but he 
did not really expect me to accept 
and I did not. Unless a septarch is 
a weakling, his younger brothers 
had best not stay nearby to help 
him rule, for such help is often not 
desired. I had had no living uncles 
on my father’s side of the family 
and I did not care to have Stirron’s 
sons be able to make the same 
statement; therefore I took myself 



ATIME OF CHANGES 



19 




quickly from Salla once the time of 
mourning was ended. 

I went to Glin, my mother's 
land. There, however, things were 
unsatisfactory for me and after a 
few years I moved on to the steamy 
province of Manneran, where I 
won my wife and sired my sons, be- 
came a prince in more than name 
and lived happily and sturdily un- 
til my time of changes began. 



II 

P erhaps i should set down 
some words concerning my 
world’s geography. 

There are five continents on our 
planet of Borthan. In this hemi- 
sphere are two, Velada Borthan 
and Sumara Borthan, which is to 
say, the Northern World and the 
Southern World. It is a long sea 
journey from any shore of' these 
continents to the continents of the 
opposite hemisphere, which have 
been named merely Umbis, Dabis, 
Tibis, that is, One, Two, Three. 

Of those three distant lands I can 
tell you very little. They first were 
explored some seven hundred 
years ago by a septarch of Glin and 
not five seeking-parties have been 
to them in all the time since. No 
human folk dwell in that 
hemisphere. Umbis is said to be 
largely like the Burnt Lowlands, 
but worse, with golden flames 
bursting from the tormented land 
in many places. Dabis is jungles 



and fever-ridden swamps. Tibis is 
covered with ice. 

We are not a race afflicted with 
the wanderlust. I myself was never 
a voyager until circumstances 
made me one. Though the blood of 
the ancient Earthmen flows in our 
veins and they were wanderers 
whose demons drove them out to 
prowl the stars, we of Borthan stay 
close to home. Even I who am 
somewhat different from my 
comrades in my way of thinking 
never hungered to see the snow- 
fields of Tibis or the marshes of 
Davis, except perhaps when I was 
a child and eager to gobble all the 
universe. Among us it is consid- 
ered a great thing merely to jour- 
ney from Salla to Glin, and rare 
indeed is the man who has crossed 
the continent, let alone ventured to 
Sumara Borthan, as 1 have done. 

More of that later. 

Velada Borthan is the home of 
our civilization. The mapmakers’ 
art reveals it to be a large squarish 
landmass with rounded corners. 
Two great V-shaped indentations 
puncture its periphery: along the 
northern coast, midway between 
the eastern and western corners, is 
the Polar Gulf and, due south on 
the opposite coast, is the Gulf of 
Sumar. Between those two bodies 
of water lie the Lowlands, a 
trough that spans the entire 
continent from north to south. No 
point in the Lowlands rises higher 
above sea level than the height of 
five men and many places notably 



22 



GALAXY 




in the Burnt Lowlands, are far 
below sea level. 

A folk tale we tell our children 
concerns the shape of Velada Bor- 
than. We say that the great ice- 
worm Hrungir, born in the waters 
of the North Polar Sea, stirred and 
woke one day in sudden appetite 
and began to nibble at the northern 
shore of Velada Borthan. The 
worm chewed for a thousand 
thousand years, until it had eaten 
out the Polar Gulf. Then, its vo- 
racity having made it somewhat ill, 
it crawled up on the land to rest 
and digest what it had devoured. 
Uneasy at the stomach, Hrungir 
wriggled southward, causing the 
land to sink beneath its vast weight 
and the mountains to rise in com- 
pensation to the east and west of its 
resting place. The worm rested 
longest in the Burnt Lowlands, 
which accordingly were depressed 
more deeply than any other region. 
In time the worm’s appetite re- 
vived and it resumed its southward 
crawl, coming at last to a place 
where a range of mountains run- 
ning from east to west barred its 
advance. Then it chewed the moun- 
tains, creating Stroin Gap, and 
proceeded toward our southern 
coast. In another fit of hunger the 
worm bit out the Gulf of Sumar. 
The waters of the Strait of Sumar 
rushed in to fill the place where the 
land had been and the rising tide 
carried Hrungir to the continent of 
Sumara Borthan, where now the 
iceworm lives, coiled beneath the 



volcano Vashnir and emitting 
poisonous fumes. So the fable 
goes. 

T HE long narrow basin that we 
think of as Hrungir’s track is 
divided into three districts. At the 
northern end we have the Frozen 
Lowlands, a place of perpetual ice 
where no man ever is seen: legend 
has it that the air is so dry and cold 
that a single breath will turn a 
man’s lungs to leather. South of the 
Frozen Lowlands lie the immense 
Burnt Lowlands, which are almost 
totally without water and on which 
the full fury of our sun constantly 
falls. Our two towering north-south 
mountain ranges prevent a drop of 
rain from entering the Burnt 
Lowlands, nor do any rivers or 
streams reach it. The soil is bright 
red, with occasional yellow 
streaks — this we blame on the heat 
of Hrungir’s belly, though our 
geologists tell another tale. Small 
plants live in the Burnt Lowlands, 
taking their nourishment from I 
know not where and there are 
many kinds of beasts, all of them 
strange, deformed and unpleasant. 
At the southern end of the Burnt 
Lowlands is a deep east-west 
valley, several days’ journey in 
breadth. On its far side lies the 
small district known as the Wet 
Lowlands. 

Northerly breezes coming off the 
Gulf of Sumar carry moisture 
through Stroin Gap; these winds 



ATIME OF CHANGES 



23 




meet the fierce hot blasts out of the 
Burnt Lowlands and are forced to 
drop their burden not far above the 
Gap, creating a land of dense, lush 
vegetation. Never do the water- 
laden breezes from the south 
succeed in getting north of the Wet 
Lowlands to bathe the zone of red 
soil. The Frozen Lowlands, as I 
have said, go forever unvisited, and 
the Burnt Lowlands are entered 
only by hunters and those who 
must travel between the eastern 
and western coasts, but the Wet 
Lowlands are populated by several 
thousand farmers, who raise exotic 
fruits for the city folk. I am told 
that the constant rain rots their 
souls, that they have no form of 
government in there, and that our 
customs of self-denial are 
imperfectly observed. I would be 
among them now, to discover their 
nature at first hand, if only 1 could 
slip through the cordon that my 
enemies have set up to the south of 
this place. 

The Lowlands are flanked by 
two immense mountain ranges: the 
Huishtors in the east, the Threish- 
tors in the west. These mountains 
begin on Velada Borthan’s north- 
ern coast, virtually at the shores of 
the North Polar Sea, and march 
southward, gradually curving in- 
land; the two ranges would join not 
far from the Gulf of Sumar if they 
were not separated by Stroin Gap. 
They are so high that they in- 
tercept all winds. Therefore their 
inland slopes are barren, but the 



slopes facing the oceans enjoy fer- 
tility. 

Mankind in Velada Borthan has 
carved out its domain in the two 
coastal strips, between the oceans 
and the mountains. In most places 
the land is at best marginal, so that 
we are hard put to have all the food 
we need and life is constant 
struggle against hunger. Often one 
wonders why our ancestors, when 
they came to this planet so many 
generations ago, chose Velada 
Borthan as their settling-place; the 
farming would have been far easi- 
er in the neighboring continent of 
Sumara Borthan and even swampy 
Dabis might have offered more 
cheer. The explanation we are giv- 
en is that our forefathers were 
stern, diligent folk who relished 
challenge and feared to let their 
children dwell in a place where life 
might be insufficiently harsh. Vel- 
ada Borthan’s coasts were neither 
uninhabitable nor unduly com- 
fortable; therefore they suited the 
purposes. I believe this to be true, 
for certainly the chief heritage we 
have from those ancient ones is the 
notion that comfort is sin. and ease 
is wickedness. My bondbrother 
Noim, though, once remarked 
that the first settlers chose Velada 
Borthan because that was where 
their starship happened to come 
down and, having hauled them- 
selves across all the immensities of 
space, they lacked the energy to 
travel onward even one more con- 
tinent in quest of a better home. I

doubt it, but the slyness of the idea 
is characteristic of my bondbroth- 
er’s taste for irony. 

The firstcomers planted their 
initial settlement on the western 
coast, at the place we call Threish, 
that is, the place of the Covenant. 
They multiplied rapidly and, be- 
cause they were a stubborn and 
quarrelsome tribe, they splintered 
early, this group and that going off 
to live apart. Thus the nine west- 
ern provinces came into being. 

In time the limited resources of 
the west were exhausted and emi- 
grants sought the eastern coast. We 
had no air transport then, not that 
we have a great deal now; we are 
not a mechanically minded people 
and we lack natural resources to 
serve as fuels. Thus they went east 
by groundcar or whatever served as 
groundcars then. The three 
Threishtor passes were discovered 
and the bold ones bravely entered 
the Burnt Lowlands. We tell long 
mythic epics of the hardships of 
these crossings. Getting over the 
Threishtors into the Lowlands was 
difficult, but getting out on the far 
side was close to impossible, for 
there is only one route over the 
Huishtors out of the red-soil 
country fit for humans, and that is 
by way of Salla’s Gate, the finding 
of which was no small task. But 
they found it and poured through 
and established my land of Salla. 
When the quarreling came, a good 
many went north and founded Glin 
and later others went south to settle 



in holy Manneran. For a thousand 
years it was sufficient to have but 
three provinces in the east, until in 
a new quarrel the small but 
prosperous maritime kingdom of 
Krell carved itself out of a corner 
of Glin and a corner of Salla. 

There also were some folk who 
could not abide life in Velada Bor- 
than at all, and put to sea from 
Manneran, sailing off to settle in 
Sumara Borthan. But one need not 
speak of them in a geography 
lesson; I will have much to say Of 
Sumara Borthan and its people 
when I have begun to explain the 
changes that entered my life. 

T HIS cabin where I hide myself 
now is a shabby thing. Its clap- 
board walls were indifferently put 
together to begin with and now are 
crazed, so that gaps yawn at the 
joints and no angle is true. The 
desert wind passes through here 
unhindered; my. page bears a light 
coating of red soil, my clothes are 
caked with it, even my hair has a 
red tinge. Lowlands creatures 
crawl freely in with me. 1 see two 
of them moving about the earthen 
floor now, a many-legged gray 
thing the size of my thumb and a 
sluggish two-tailed serpent not as 
long as my foot. For hours they 
have circled one another idly, as 
though they wish to be mortal foes 
but cannot decide which of them is 
to eat the other. Dry companions 
for a parched time. 

I should not mock this place. 



A TIME OF CHANGES

though. Someone troubled to drag 
its makings here, in order that 
weary hunters might have shelter in 
this inhospitable land. Someone 
put it together, doubtless with 
more love than skill, and left it here 
for me and it serves me well. 
Perhaps it is no fit home for a sep- 
tarch’s son, but I have known my 
share of palaces and I no longer 
need stone walls and groined ceil- 
ings. It is peaceful here. I am far 
from the fishmongers and the 
drainers and the wine-peddlers and 
all those others whose songs of 
commerce clang in the streets of 
cities. A man can think; a man can 
look within his soul and find those 
things that have been the shaping 
of him, draw them forth and 
examine them and come to know 
himself. In this our world we are 
forbidden by custom to make our 
souls known to others, yes, but why 
has no one before me observed 
that that same custom, without 
intending it, keeps us from coming 
to know ourselves? For nearly all 
my life Lkept the proper social 
walls between myself and others, 
and not till the walls were down did 
I see I had walled myself away 
from myself as well. But here in the 
Burnt Lowlands I have had time to 
contemplate these matters and to 
arrive at understanding. This is 
not the place I would have chosen 
for myself, but I am not unhappy 
here. 

I do not think they will find me 
for some while yet. 



Now it is too dark in here to 
write. I will stand by the cabin door 
and watch the night come rolling 
across the Lowlands toward the 
Huishtors. The stars will blaze. 
Schweiz once tried to show me the 
sun of Earth from a mountaintop 
in Sumara Borthan. He insisted he 
could see it and begged me to 
squint along the line of his pointing 
hand, but I think he was playing a 
game with me, I think that that sun 
may not be seen at all from our 
sector of the galaxy. Schweiz 
played many a game with me when 
we traveled together, and perhaps 
he will play more such games one 
day if ever we meet again -if still 
he lives. 

L AST night in a dream my bond- 
sister Halum Helalam came to 
me. 

With her there can never be 
more games and only through the 
slippery-walled tunnel of dreams is 
she apt to reach me. Therefore 
while I slept she glowed in my mind 
more brightly than any star that 
lights this desert, but waking 
brought me sadness and shame and 
the memory of my loss of her who 
is irreplaceable. 

Halum of my dream wore only a 
light filmy veil through which her 
small rosy-tipped breasts showed 
— and her slim thighs and her flat 
belly, the belly of an unchilded 
woman. It was not the way she 
often dressed in life, especially 
when paying a call on her bondbro- 



26 



GALAXY 




ther, but this was the Halum of my 
dream, made wanton by my lonely 
and troubled soul. Her smile was 
warm and tender and her dark 
shining eyes glistened with love. 

In dreams one’s mind lives on 
many levels. On one level of mine I 
was a detached observer, looking 
down upon my own sleeping body. 
On another level 1 lay asleep. The 
dream-self that slept did not 
perceive Halum’s presence, but the 
dream-self that watched was aware 
of her and I, the true dreamer, was 
aware of them both and also aware 
that all I saw was coming to me in 
a vision. But inevitably there was 
some mingling of these levels of 
reality, so that 1 could not be sure 
who was the dreamer and who the 
dreamed, nor was 1 certain that the 
Halum who stood before me in 
such radiance was a creature of my 
fantasy rather than the living 
Halum I once had known. 

“Kinnall,” she whispered, and in 
my dream I imagined that my 
sleeping dream-self awoke, prop- 
ping himself upon his elbows, with 
Halum kneeling close beside his 
cot. She leaned forward until her 
breasts brushed the shaggy chest of 
that man who was I, and touched 
her lips to mine in a flick of a ca- 
ress and said, “You look so weary, 
Kinnall.” 

“You should not have come 
here.” 

“One was needed. One came.” 

“It is not right. To enter the 
Burnt Lowlands alone, to seek out 



one who has brought you only 
harm — ” 

"The bond that links one to you 
is sacred.” 

“You've suffered enough for 
that bond, Halum.” 

“One has not suffered at all,” 
she said, and kissed my sweaty 
forehead. “How you must suffer, 
hiding in this dismal oven!” 

“It is no more than one has 
earned,” I said. 

Even in my dream I spoke to 
Halum in the polite grammatical 
form. I had never found it easy to 
use the first person with her; cer- 
tainly I never used it before my 
changes and afterward, when no 
reason remained for me to be so 
chaste with her, I still could not. 
My soul and my heart had yearned 
to say “I” to Halum and my 
tongue and lips were padlocked by 
propriety. 

She said, “You deserve so much 
more than this place. You must 
come forth from exile. You must 
guide us, Kinnall, toward a new 
Covenant, a Covenant of love, of 
trust in one another.” 

“One fears he has been a failure 
as a prophet. One doubts the value 
of continuing such efforts.” 

“It was all so strange to you, so 
new!” she said. “But you were able 
to change, Kinnall, and to bring 
changes to others — ” 

“To bring grief to others and to 
oneself.” 

“No. No. What you tried to do 
was right. How can you give up 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



27 




now? How can you resign yourself 
to death? There's a world out there 
in need of being freed, Kinnall !” 
“One is trapped in this place. 
One’s capture is inevitable.” 

“The desert is wide. You can slip 
away from them.” 

“The desert is wide, but the gates 
are few and all of them are 
watched. There’s no escape." 

She shook her head, smiled, 
pressed her hands urgently against 
my hips and said in a voice thick 
with hope, “I will lead you to safe- 
ty. Come with me, Kinnall.” 

The sound of that / and the me 
that followed it out of Halum’s 
imagined mouth fell upon my 
dreaming soul like a rainfall of 
rusted spikes — the shock of hear- 
ing those obscenities in her sweet 
voice, nearly awakened me. This 
thing I tell you to make it clear that 
I am not fully converted to my own 
changed way of life, that the 
reflexes of my upbringing still gov- 
ern me in the deepest corners of my 
soul. What happened next was also 
revealing, though far less subtle. 
To urge me from my cot Halum's 
hands slipped over my body, 
working their way through the 
tangled thatch over my gut, and her 
cool fingers seized me. Instantly 
my heart thundered and the ground 
heaved as though the Lowlands 
were splitting apart and Halum 
uttered a little cry of fear. 1 reached 
for her, but she was growing 
indistinct and insubstantial— and 
in one terrible convulsion of the 



planet 1 lost sight of her and she 
was gone. I woke, coming up 
through the levels of my dream. 1 
found myself alone in the hut. 

“ Halum /” I cried. “Halum, 
Halum, Halum!” 

My voice made the cabin quiver, 
but she did not return. And slowly 
my sleep-fogged mind grasped the 
truth, that the Halum who had 
visited me had been unreal. 

We of Borthan do not take such 
visions lightly, however. I rose and 
went from my cabin into the 
darkness outside and walked 
about, scuffing at the warm sand 
with my bare toes as I struggled to 
excuse my inventions to myself. 
Slowly I calmed. Yet 1 sat by my 
doorstep unsleeping for hours, 
until dawn's first green fingers 
crept upon me. 

Beyond doubt you will agree 
with me that a man who has been 
apart from women some time, liv- 
ing under the tensions I have 
known since my flight into the 
Burnt Lowlands, will occasionally 
experience such sexual eruptions 
in his sleep, nor is there anything 
unnatural about them. I must 
maintain also, though I have little 
enough evidence to prove it, that 
many men of Borthan find 
themselves giving way in slumber 
to expressions of desire for their 
bondsisters, simply because such 
desires are so rigidly repressed in 
the waking time. And further, 
although Halum and 1 enjoyed 
intimacies of soul far beyond those 



28 



GALAXY 




which men customarily enjoy with 
their bondsisters, never once did 1 
seek her physically, nor did such a 
union ever occur. Take this on 
faith, if you will: in these pages I 
tell you so much that is 
discreditable to me, making no 
attempt to conceal that which is 
shameful, that if I had violated 
Halum's bond I would tell you that 
as well. You may not hold me 
guilty of sins committed in dreams. 

Nevertheless 1 held myself guilty 
through the waning of the night 
and into this morning, and only as 
I purge myself now by putting the 
incident on paper does the darkness 
lift from my spirit. I think what has 
really troubled me these past few 
hours is not so much my sordid 
little sexual fantasy, for which even 
my enemies would probably 
forgive me, as it is my belief that I 
am responsible for Halum’s 
death — for which I am unable to 
forgive myself. 

Ill 

P OSSIBLY I should say that 
every man of Borthan and by 
the same token every woman is 
sworn at birth or soon thereafter to 
a bondsister and bondbrother. No 
member of any such tripling may 
be blood-kin to any other. The 
bondings are arranged soon after a 
child is conceived, and often are 
the subject of intricate ne- 
gotiation, since one’s bondbrother 



and bondsister are customarily 
closer to one than one's own 
family-by-blood; hence a father 
owes it to his child to make the 
bondings with care. 

Because I was to be a septarch’s 
second son, arranging my bond- 
ings was a matter of high circum- 
stance. It might have been good 
democracy, but poor sense, to bond 
me to a peasant’s child, for one 
must be reared on the same social 
plane as one’s bond-kin if any prof- 
it is to come from the relationship. 
On the other hand I could not be 
bonded to the kin of some other 
septarch, since fate might one day 
elevate me to my father’s throne, 
and a septarch must not be tangled 
in ties of bonding to the royal 
house of another district lest he 
find his freedom of decision cir- 
cumscribed. Thus it was necessary 
to make bondings for me with the 
children of nobility but not of 
royalty. 

The project was handled by my 
father’s bondbrother, Ulman Kot- 
ril; it was the last aid he ever gave 
my father, for he was slain by ban- 
dits from Krell not long after my 
birth. To find a bondsister for me, 
Ulman Kotril went down into 
Manneran and obtained bonding 
with the unborn child of Segvord 
Helalam, High Justice of the Port. 
It had been determined that Hela- 
lam’s child was to be female; hence 
my father’s bondbrother returned 
to Salla and completed the tripling 
by compacting with Luinn Condo- 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



29 




rit, a general of the northern pa- 
trol, for his conning son. 

Noim, Halum and 1 were born 
all in the same week and my father 
himself performed the service of 
bonding. (We were known by our 
child-names then, of course, but I 
ignore that here to simplify things.) 
The ceremony took place in the 
septarch’s palace, with proxies 
standing in for Noim and Halum; 
later, when we were old enough to 
travel, we repledged our bonds in 
each other’s presence, I going to 
Manneran to be bonded to Halum. 
Thereafter we were only infre- 
quently apart. Segvord Helalam 
had no objection to letting his 
daughter be raised in Saila, for he 
hoped she would strike a glittering 
marriage with some prince at my 
father’s court. In this he was to be 
disappointed, for Halum went 
unmarried and, for all I know, 
virgin to her grave. 

This scheme of bondings allows 
us a small escape from the con- 
stricting solitude in which we of 
Borthan are expected to live. You 
must know by now — even if you 
who read this be a stranger to our 
planet — that it has long been for- 
bidden by custom for us to open 
our souls to others. To talk exces- 
sively of oneself, so our forefathers 
believed, leads inevitably to self- 
indulgence, self-pity and self- 
corruption; therefore we are 
trained to keep ourselves to 
ourselves and, so that the prisoning 
bands of custom may be all the 



more steely, we are prohibited even 
from using such words as “I” or 
“me” in polite discourse. If we 
have problems we settle them in 
silence; if we have ambitions we 
fulfill them without advertising our 
hopes; if we have desires we pursue 
them in a selfless and impersonal 
way. To these harsh rules only two 
exceptions are made. We may 
speak our hearts freely to our 
drainers, who are religious 
functionaries and mere hirelings; 
and we may, within limits, open 
ourselves to our bond-kin. These 
are the rules of the Covenant. 

It is permissible to confide al- 
most anything to a bondsister or a 
bondbrother, but we are taught to 
observe etiquette in going about it. 
For example, proper people con- 
sider it improper to speak in the 
first person even to one's bond-kin. 
It is not done, ever. No matter how 
intimate a confession we make, we 
must couch it in acceptable 
grammar, not in the vulgarities of a 
common selfbarer. 

(In our idiom a selfbarer is one 
who exposes himself to others, by 
which is meant that he exposes his 
soul, not his flesh. It is deemed a 
coarse act and is punished by so- 
cial ostracism or worse. Selfbarers 
use the censured pronouns of the 
gutter vocabulary, as I have done 
throughout what you now read. Al- 
though one is allowed to bare one’s 
self to one’s bond-kin, one is not a 
selfbarer unless one does it in 
tawdry blurtings of “I” and “me”.)

GALAXY 




Also we are taught to observe 
reciprocity in our dealings with 
bond-kin. That is, we may not 
overload them with our woes, 
pouring into their ears a torrential 
gush of self, while failing to ease 
them of their own burdens. This is 
plain civility: the relationship 
depends on mutuality, and we may 
make use of them only if we are 
careful to let them make use of us. 
Children are often one-sided in 
their dealings with bond-kin; one 
may dominate his bondbrother 
and chatter endlessly at him 
without pausing to heed the other’s 
woes. But such things usually come 
into balance early. 

D F ALL the prohibitions having 
to do with bonding the most se- 
vere is the one against physical re- 
lationships with our bond-kin. In 
sexual matters we are generally 
quite free, only we dare not do this 
one thing. This struck at me most 
painfully. Not that I yearned for 
Noim, for that has never been my 
path, nor is it a common one 
among us; but Halum was my 
soul’s desire and neither as wife nor 
as mistress could she ever comfort 
me. Long hours we sat up together, 
her hand in mine, telling one 
another things we could tell no one 
else -and how easy it would have 
been for me to draw' her close, part 
her garments and join my flesh 
with hers. I would not attempt it. 
My conditioning held firm; and, as 



I hope to survive long enough to 
tell you, even after Schweiz and his 
potion had changed my soul, still 
did 1 respect the sanctity of 
Halum’s body, although I was able 
to enter her in other ways. But I 
will not deny my desire for her. 
Nor can I forget the shock I felt 
when I learned in boyhood that of 
all Borthan’s women only Halum, 
my beloved Halum, was denied to 
me. 

1 was extraordinarily close to 
Halum in every but the physical 
way and she was for me the ideal 
bondsister: open, giving, loving, se- 
rene, radiant, adaptable. Not only 
was she beautiful — creamy- 
skinned, dark-eyed and dark of 
hair, slender and graceful — but 
also she was remarkable within 
herself, for her soul was gentle and 
sleek and supple, a wondrous 
mixture of purity and wisdom. 
Thinking of her, I see the image of 
a forest glade in the mountains - 
black-needled evergreen trees ris- 
ing close together like shadowy 
swords springing from a bed of 
newly fallen snow and a sparkling 
stream dancing between sun-spat- 
tered boulders, everything clean, 
untainted and self-contained. 
Sometimes when 1 was with her I 
felt impossibly thick and clumsy, a 
hulking lumbering mountain of 
dull meat, with an ugly hairy body 
and stupid ponderous muscles; but 
Halum had the skill of showing 
me, with a word, with a laugh, with 
a wink, that 1 was being unjust to 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



31 




myself when I let the sight of her 
lightness and gaiety lead me to 
wish I was woman-soft and wom- 
an-airy. 

On the other side I was equally 
close to Noim. He was my foil in 
many ways: slender where I am 
burly, crafty where I am direct, 
cautious and calculating where I 
am rash, bleak of outlook where I 
am sunny. With him as with 
Halum I frequently felt awkward, 
not really in any bodily sense (for, 
as 1 have told you, 1 move well for 
a man my size) but in my inward 
nature. Noim, more mercurial than 
I, livelier, quicker of wit, seemed 
to leap and cavort where I merely 
plodded, and yet the prevailing pes- 
simism of his spirit made him ap- 
pear deeper than 1 as well as more 
buoyant. To give myself credit, 
Noim looked with envy on me just 
as I did on him. He was jealous of 
my great strength - furthermore, 
he confessed that he felt mean- 
souled and petty when he peered 
into my eyes. “One sees simplicity 
and power there,” he admitted, 
“and one is aware that one often 
cheats, that one is lazy, that one 
breaks faith, that one does a dozen 
wicked things daily — and none of 
these are any more natural to you 
than dining on your own flesh.” 

You must understand that Hal- 
um and Noim were no bond-kin to 
one another and were linked only 
by way of their common relation- 
ship to me. Noim had a bondsister 
of his own, a certain Thirga, and 



Halum was bonded to a girl of 
Manneran, Nald by name. 
Through such ties the Covenant 
creates a chain that clasps our 
society together, for Thirga had a 
bondsister, too, and Nald a 
bondbrother — and each of them 
was bonded in turn on the other 
side — and so on to form a vast if 
not infinite series. Obviously one 
comes in contact often with the 
bond-kin of one’s own bond-kin, 
though one is not free to assume 
with them the same privileges one 
has with those of one’s bonding; I 
frequently saw Noim’s Thirga and 
Halum’s Nald, just as Halum saw 
my Noim and Noim saw my 
Halum, but there was never 
anything more than nodding 
friendship between me and Thirga 
or me and Nald, while Noim and 
Halum took to each other with 
immediate warmth. Indeed 1 
suspected for a time that they 
might marry one another, which 
would have been uncommon but 
not illegal. 

Halum now sleeps forever under 
a stone in Manneran, and Noim 
has become a stranger to me, per- 
haps even an enemy to me, and the 
red sand of the Burnt Lowlands 
blows in my face as I set down 
these lines. 



A FTER my brother Stirron be- 
came septarch in Salla, I went, 
as you know, to the province of 
Glin. 1 will not say that I fled to 



32 



GALAXY 




Glin, for no one openly compelled 
me to leave my native land — but 
call my departure a deed of tact. I 
left in order to spare Slirron the 
eventual embarrassment of put- 
ting me to death, which would have 
weighed badly upon his soul. One 
province cannot hold safely the two 
sons of a late septarch. 

Glin was my choice because it is 
customary for exiles from Salla to 
go to Glin and also because my 
mother's family held wealth and 
power there. I thought, wrongly as 
it turned out, that I might gain 
some advantage from that connec- 
tion. 

1 was about three moontimes 
short of the age of thirteen when I 
took my leave of Salla. Among us 
that is the threshold of manhood; I 
had reached almost my present 
height, though 1 was much more 
slender and far less strong than 1 
would soon become and my beard 
had only lately begun to grow full. 
I knew something of history and 
government, something of the arts 
of warfare, something of the skills 
of hunting, and I had had some 
training in the practice of the law. 
Already I had bedded at least a 
dozen girls and three limes 1 had 
known, briefly, the tempests of un- 
happy love. 1 had kept the Cove- 
nant all my life; my soul was clean 
and I was at peace with our gods 
and with my forefathers. In my 
own eyes at that time I must have 
seemed hearty, adventurous, ca- 
pable, honorable and resilient, with 



all the world spread before me like 
a shining highway and the future 
mine for the shaping. The per- 
spective of thirty years tells me that 
that young man who left Salla then 
was also naive, gullible, romantic, 
overly earnest, conventional and 
clumsy of mind: quite an ordinary 
youth, in fact, who might have been 
skinning seapups in some fishing 
village had he not had the great 
good fortune to be born a prince. 

The season of my going was 
early autumn, after a springtime 
when all Salla had mourned my 
father and a summer when all Salla 
had hailed my brother. The harvest 
had been poor — nothing odd in 
Salla, where the fields yield pebbles 
and stones more graciously than 
they do crops - and Salla City was 
choked with, bankrupt husband- 
men, hoping to catch some largesse 
from the new septarch. A dull hot 
haze hung over the capital day 
after day and above it lay the first 
of autumn’s heavy clouds, floating 
in on schedule from the eastern sea. 
The streets were dusty; the trees 
had begun to drop their leaves 
early, even the majestic firethorns 
outside the septarch’s palace; the 
dung of the farmers' beasts clogged 
the gutters. These were poor omens 
for Salla at the beginning of a 
septarch’s reign and to me it 
seemed like a wise season for get-

court, coddled and complimented, 
plied with fur cloaks and promises 
of baronies in the mountains, but 
for how long, how long? Just now 
Stirron was troubled with guilt that 
he had inherited the throne and I 
had nothing and so he treated me 
softly, but let the dry summer give 
way to a bitter winter of famine 
and the scales might shift; envying 
me my freedom from responsibili- 
ty, he might well turn on me. I had 
studied the annals of royal houses 
well. Such things had happened be- 
fore. 

Therefore I readied myself for a 
hasty exit. Only Noim and Halum 
knew of my plans. I gathered those 
few of my possessions that I had no 
wish to abandon, such things as a 
ring of ceremony bequeathed by 
my father, a favorite hunting jerkin 
of yellow leather and a double- 
cameo amulet bearing the portraits 
of my bondsister and bondbrother; 
all my books 1 relinquished, for one 
can get more books wherever one 
goes, and I did not even take the 
hornfowl spear, my trophy of my 
father’s death-day, that hung in my 
palace bedchamber. There was to 
my name a fairly large amount of 
money and this I handled in what 1 
believed was a shrewd manner. It 
was all on deposit in the Royal 
Salla Bank. First I transferred the 
bulk of my funds to the six lesser 
provincial banks, over the course of 
many days. These new accounts 
were held jointly with Halum and 
Noim. Halum then proceeded to 



make withdrawals, asking that the 
money be paid into the Commer- 
cial and Seafarers Bank of Man- 
neran, for the account of her fa- 
ther Segvord Helalam. If we were 
detected in this transfer, Halum 
was to declare that her father had 
undergone financial reverses and 
had requested a loan of short du- 
ration. Once my assets were safely 
on deposit in Manneran, Halum 
asked her father to transfer the 
money again, this time to an ac- 
count in my name in the Covenant 
Bank of Glin. In this zigzag way I 
got my cash from Salla to Glin 
without arousing the suspicions of 
our Treasury officials, who might 
wonder why a prince of the realm 
was shipping his patrimony to our 
rival province of the north. The fa- 
tal flaw in all this was that if the 
Treasury became disturbed about 
the flow of capital to Manneran, 
questioned Halum and then made 
inquiries of her father, the truth 
would emerge that Segvord pros- 
pered and had had no need of the 
“loan,” which would have led to 
further questions and, probably, to 
my exposure. But my maneuvers 
went unnoticed. 

Lastly I went before my brother 
to ask his permission to leave the 
capital, as courtly etiquette re- 
quired. 

This was a tense affair, for hon- 
or would not let me lie to Stirron, 
yet I dared not tell him the truth. 
Long hours I spent with Noim, 
first, rehearsing my deceptions. I 



34

was a slow pupil in chicanery; 
Noim spat, he cursed, he wept, he 
slapped his hands together, as time 
and again he slipped through my 
guard with a probing question. 

“You were not meant to be a 
liar," he told me in despair. 

“No," I agreed, “this one never 
was meant to be a liar.” 



S TIRRON received me in the 
northern robing chamber, a dark 
and somber room of rough stone 
walls and narrow windows, used 
mainly for audiences with village 
chieftains. He meant no offense by 
it, 1 think; it was merely where he 
happened to be when I sent in my 
equerry with word that 1 wished a 
meeting. It was late afternoon; a 
thin greasy rain was falling outside; 
in some far tower of the palace a 
carilloneur was instructing appren- 
tices and leaden bell-tones, scan- 
dalously awry, came humming 
through the drafty walls. Stirron 
was formally dressed: a bulky gray 
robe of stormshield furs, tight red 
woolen leggings, high boots of 
green leather. The sword of the 
Covenant was at his side, the heavy 
glittering pendant of office pressed 
against his breast, rings of title 
cluttered his fingers and if memory 
does not deceive me he wore yet 
another token of power around his 
right forearm. Only the crown 
itself was missing from his regalia. 
I had seen Stirron garbed this way 
often enough of late, at ceremonies 



and meetings of state, but to find 
him so enveloped in insignia on an 
ordinary afternoon struck me as 
almost comical. Was he so 
insecure that he needed to load 
himself with such stuff constantly, 
to reassure himself that he was 
indeed septarch? Did he feel that he 
had to impress his own younger 
brother? Or did he, childlike, take 
pleasure in these ornaments for 
peasure’s own sake? No matter 
which, some flaw in Stirron's 
character was revealed, some inner 
foolishness. It astounded me that I 
could find his amusing rather than 
awesome. Perhaps the genesis of 
my ultimate rebellion lies in that 
moment when I walked in on 
Stirron in all his splendor and had 
to fight to hold my laughter back. 

Half a year in the septarchy had 
left its mark on him. His face was 
gray and his left eyelid drooped, I 
suppose from exhaustion. He held 
his lips tightly compressed and 
stood in a rigid way, one shoulder 
higher than the other. Though only 
two years separated us in age, I felt 
myself a boy beside him and 
marveled how the cares of office 
can etch a young man’s visage. It 
seemed centuries since Stirron and 
I had laughed together in our bed- 
chambers, whispered all the for- 
bidden words and bared our ripen- 
ing bodies to one another to make 
the edgy comparisons of adoles- 
cence. 

Now I offered formal obeisance 
to my weary royal brother, cross- 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



35 




ing my arms over my breast and 
flexing my knees and bowing my 
head as 1 murmured, “Lord 
septarch, long life be yours." 

Stirron was man enough to de- 
flect my formality with a brotherly 
grin. He gave me a proper ac- 
knowledgment of my my greeting, 
yes, arms raised and palms turned 
out, but then he turned it into an 
embrace, swiftly crossing the room 
and seizing me. Yet there was 
something artificial about his ges- 
ture, as though he had been study- 
ing how to show warmth to his 
brother, and quickly I was re- 
leased. 

He wandered away from me, 
eyeing a nearby window, and his 
first words to me were: “A beastly 
day. A brutal year.” 

“The crown lies heavy, lord sep- 
tarch?” 

“You have leave to call your 
brother by his name.” 

“The strains show in you, Stir- 
ron. Perhaps you take Salla’s prob- 
lems too closely to heart.” 

“The people starve,” he said. 
“Shall one pretend that is a tri- 
fling thing?” 

“The people have always 
starved, year upon year,” I said. 
“But if the septarch drains his soul 
in worry over them — ” 

“Enough, Kinnall. You pre- 
sume.” Nothing brotherly about 
the tone now; he was hard put to 
hide his irritation with me. He was 
plainly angered that 1 had so much 
as noticed his fatigue, though it was 



he who had begun our talk with 
lamenting. The conversation had 
veered too far toward the intimate. 
The condition of Stirron’s nerves 
was no affair of mine: it was not 
my place to comfort him, he had a 
bondbrother for that. My at- 
tempted kindness had been im- 
proper and inappropriate. "What 
do you seek here?” he asked 
roughly. 

“The lord septarch's leave to go 
from the capital.” 

He whirled away from the win- 
dow and glared at me. His eyes, 
dull and sluggish until this mo- 
ment, grew bright and harsh and 
flickered disturbingly from side to 
side. 

“To go? To go where?” 

“One wishes to accompany one’s 
bondbrother Noim to the northern 
frontier,” I said as smoothly as I 
could manage. “Noim pays a call 
on the headquarters of his father, 
General Luinn Condorit, whom he 
has not seen this year since your 
lordship’s coronation, and one is 
asked to travel northward with him 
for bondlove and friendship." 

“When would you go?” 

“Three days hence, if it please 
the septarch.” 

“And for how long a stay?" Stir- 
ron was virtually barking these 
questions at me. 

“Until the first snow of winter 
falls.” 

“Too long. Too long.” 

“One might be absent then a 
shorter span,” I said. 



36 



GALAXY 




“Must you go at all, though?" 

My right leg quivered shame- 
fully at the knee. I struggled to be 
calm. “Stirron, consider that one 
has not left Salla City for so much 
as an entire day since you assumed 
the throne. Consider that one 
cannot justly ask one’s bond- 
brother to journey uncomforted 
through the northern hills.” 

“Consider that you are the heir 
to the prime septarchy of Salla," 
Stirron said, “and that if misfor- 
tune comes to your brother while 
you are in the north, our dynasty is 
lost.” 

The coldness of his voice, and 
the ferocity with which he had 
questioned me a moment earlier, 
threw me into panic. Would he op- 
pose my going? 

1 said, “No misfortunes are 
probable, Stirron, and even so, it 
would be no large task to return 
from the north if something befell 
you. Do you fear usurpation so 
seriously?” 

“One fears everything, Kinnall, 
and leaves little to chance.” 



H E PROCEEDED then to lec- 
ture me on necessary caution, 
and on the ambitions of those who 
surrounded the throne, naming as 
possible traitors a few lords whom 
I would have placed among the pil- 
lars of the realm. As he spoke, go- 
ing far beyond the strictures of the 
Covenant in exposing his uncer- 
tainties to me, 1 saw with amaze- 



ment what a tortured, terrified man 
my brother had become in this 
short time of septarchy; and I real- 
ized, too, that I was not going to be 
granted my leave. He went on and 
on, fidgeting as he spoke, rubbing 
his talismans of authority, several 
times picking up his scepter from 
where it lay on an ancient wood- 
topped table, walking to the 
window and coming back from it, 
pitching his voice now low and now 
high as though searching for the 
best septarchical resonances. I was 
frightened for him. He was a man 
of my own considerable size and at 
that time much thicker in body and 
greater in strength than I all my 
life 1 had worshiped him and 
modeled myself upon him — and 
here he was corroded with terror 
and committing the sin of telling 
me about it. Had just these few 
moontimes of supreme power 
brought Stirron to this collapse? 
Was the loneliness of the septarchy 
that awful for him? On Borthan we 
are born lonely and lonely we live 
and lonely we die; why should 
wearing a crown be so much more 
difficult than bearing the burdens 
we inflict upon ourselves each day? 
Stirron told me of assassins’ plots 
and of revolution brewing among 
the farmers who thronged the town 
and even hinted that our father’s 
death had been no accident. I tried 
to persuade myself that hornfowl 
could be trained to slay a particular 
man in a group of thirteen men. I 
would not swallow the notion. It 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



37 




appeared that royal responsibilities 
had driven Stirron mad. I was 
reminded, of a duke some years 
back who displeased my father, 
was sent for half a year to a 
dungeon and tortured each day 
that the sun could be seen. He had 
entered prison a sturdy and 
vigorous figure — when he emerged 
he was so ruined that he befouled 
his own clothes with his dung and 
did not know it. How soon would 
Stirron be brought to that ? Perhaps 
it was just as well, I thought, that 
he was refusing me permission to 
go away, lor it might be better that 
1 remain at the capital, ready to 
take his place if he crumbled 
beyond repair. 

But he amazed me at the finish 
of his rambling oration; for it had 
taken him clear across the room to 
an alcove hung with dangling silver 
chains. At the end, suddenly 
bunching the chains and yanking a 
dozen of them from their mount- 
ings, he swung round to face me. 

“Give your pledge, Kinnall, that 
you will come back from the north 
in time to attend the royal wed- 
ding!” 

I was doubly pronged. For the 
last several minutes 1 had begun to 
make plans on the basis of staying 
in Salla City; now I found I could 
depart after all and was not sure I 
should, in view of Stirron’s de- 
terioration. And then, too, he de- 
manded from me a promise of swift 
return^-and how could I give the 
septarch such a promise without 



lying to him, a sin I was not 
prepared to commit? So far all that 
I had told him had been the truth, 
though only the part of the truth; I 
did plan to travel north with Noim 
to visit his father, 1 would remain 
in northern Salla until winter's first 
snow. How, though, could I set a 
date for my coming back to the 
capital? 

My brother was due to marry, 
forty days hence, the youngest 
daughter of Bryggil, septarch of 
Salla's southeastern district. It was 
a cunning match. So far as the tra- 
ditional order of primacy went, 
Bryggil stood seventh and lowest in 
the hierarchy of Salla’s septarchs, 
but he was the oldest, the cleverest 
and the most respected of the 
seven, now that my father was 
gone. To combine Bryggil's 
shrewdness and stature with the 
prestige that accrued to Stirron by 
virtue of his rank as prime septarch 
would be to cement the dynasty of 
our family to the throne. And no 
doubt sons shortly would come 
marching out of Bryggil’s 
daughter’s loins, relieving me of 
my position as heir apparent: her 
fertility must have passed the 
necessary tests and of Stirron’s 
there could be no question, since he 
had scattered a litter of bastards 
already all over Salla. I would have 
certain ceremonial roles to play at 
the wedding as brother to the sep- 
tarch. 

I had wholly forgotten the wed- 
ding. If I skipped out of Salla be- 



38

fore it came about I would wound 
my brother in a way that saddened 
me. But if 1 stayed here, with Stir- 
ron in this unstable state, 1 had no 
guarantee of being a free man when 
the nuptial day arrived, or even of 
still owning my head. Nor was 
there any sense in going north with 
Noim if I bound myself to return 
in forty days. It was a hard choice: 
to postpone my departure and run 
the risks of my brother’s royal 
whims, or to leave now, knowing I 
was taking on myself the stain of 
breaking a pledge to my septarch. 

The Covenant teaches us that we 
should welcome dilemmas, for it 
toughens character to grapple with 
the insoluble and find a solution. In 
this instance events made a 
mockery of the Covenant's lofty 
moral teachings. As 1 hesitated in 
anguish, Slirron’s telephone sum- 
moned him; he snatched its hand- 
piece, jabbed at the scrambler and 
listened to five minutes of gibber- 
ish, his face darkening and his eyes 
growing fiery. At length he broke 
the contact and peered up at me as 
though I were a stranger to him. 

“They are eating the flesh of the 
newly dead in Spoksa,” he mut- 
tered. “On the slopes of the Kon- 
goroi they dance to demons in 
hopes of finding food. Insantiy! In- 
sanity!” He clenched his fists, 
strode to the window, thrust his 
face to it, closed his eyes and, I still 
think, forgot my presence for a 
time. Again the telephone asked 
for him. Stirron jerked back like 

ATIME OF CHANGES 



one who has been stabbed and 
started toward the machine. 
Noticing me standing frozen near 
the door, he fluttered his hands 
impatiently at me and said, “Go, 
will you? Off with your bondbroth- 
er, wherever you go. This pro- 
vince! This famine! Father, father, 
father!" 

He seized the handpiece. I 
started to offer a genuflection of 
parting and Stirron furiously 
waved me from the room, sending 
me unpledged and unchecked 
toward the borders of his realm. 

IV 

N OIM and I set forth three days 
afterward, just the two of us 
and a small contingent of ser- 
vants. The weather was bad, for 
summer’s dryness had given way 
not merely to the thick dreary gray 
clouds of autumn but to a fore- 
sampling of winter’s heavy rains. 
“You’ll be dead of the mildew be- 
fore you see Glin,’’ Halum told us 
cheerfully. “If you don’t drown in 
the mud of the Grand Salla High- 
way.” 

She stayed with us, at Noim's 
house, on the eve of our de- 
parture — sleeping chastely apart 
in the little chamber just under 
the roof — and joined us for break- 
fast as we made ready to go. I had 
never seen her looking lovelier; 
that morning she wore a bloom of 
shimmering beauty that cut 
through the murk of the drizzly 

39 




dawn like a torch in a cave. Per- 
haps what enhanced her so greatly 
then was that she was about to pass 
from my life for an unknown 
length of time and, conscious of 
my self-inflicted loss, I magnified 
her attractiveness. She was clad in 
a gown of delicate golden chain- 
mesh, beneath which only a 
gossamer wrap concealed her 
naked form — and her body, shift- 
ing this way and that under its 
flimsy coverings, aroused in me 
thoughts that left me drenched in 
shame. Halum then was in the ripe- 
ness of early womanhood and had 
been for several years; it had al- 
ready begun to puzzle me that she 
remained unwed. Though she and 
Noim and I were of the same age, 
she had leaped free of childhood 
before us, as girls will do, and I 
had come to think of her as older 
than the two of us. because for a 
year she had had breasts and the 
monthly (low while Noim and I 
had still been without hair on 
cheek or body. And, while we had 
caught up to her in physical 
maturity, she was still more adult 
in her bearing than my bond- 
brother or 1, her voice more 
smoothly modulated, her man- 
ner more poised, and it was im- 
possible for me to shake off that 
notion that she was senior sister to 
us. Who soon must accept some 
suitor, lest she become overripe 
and sour in her maidenhood; I was 
suddenly certain that Halum 
would marry while 1 was off hiding 



in Glin — and the thought of some 
sweaty stranger planting babies 
between her thighs so sickened me 
that 1 turned away from her at the 
table and lurched to the window to 
gulp the humid air into my throb- 
bing lungs. 

The servants waited in the street. 
The groundcars were ready. 
Halum embraced us, clasping 
Noim first, then me, for 1 was the 
one who would not be returning 
and that called for a longer fare- 
well. When she came into my arms 
1 was stunned by the intensity with 
which she offered herself; her lips 
to my lips, her belly to my belly, 
her breasts crushed against my 
chest. On tiptoes she strained to 
press her body into mine and for a 
moment 1 felt her trembling, un- 
til I began myself to tremble. It 
was not a sisterly kiss and cer- 
tainly not a bondsislerly kiss; it 
was the passionate kiss of a bride 
sending her young husband off to 
a war from which she knows there 
is no coming back. 

I was singed by Halum's sudden 
fire. 1 fell as though a veil had been 
ripped away and some Halum I 
had not known before had (lung 
herself against me, one who 
burned with the needs of the tlesh, 
one who did not mind revealing 
her forbidden hunger for a bond- 
brother's body. Or did I imagine 
those things in her? It seemed to 
me that for a single protracted in- 
stant Halum repressed nothing 
and allowed her arms and lips to 



40 



GALAXY 




tell me the truth about her feel- 
ings; but I could not respond in 
kind. I had trained myself too well 
in the proper attitudes toward 
one’s bondsister and I was dis- 
tant and cool as I clasped her. 1 
may even have thrust her back a lit- 
tle, shocked by her forwardness. 
And, as I say, there may have been 
no forwardness at all except in 
my overwrought mind, but only 
legitimate grief at a parting. In 
any event the intensity went 
quickly from Halum; her embrace 
slackened and she released me. She 
appeared downcast and chilled, as 
if I had rebuffed her cruelly by be- 
ing so prim when she was giving so 
much. 

“Come, now,” Noim said 
impatiently and, trying somehow 
to rescue the situation, I lifted 
Halum's hand and touched my 
palm lightly to her cool palm. 1 
smiled an awkward smile and she 
smiled even more awkwardly. Per- 
haps we would have said a 
stumbling word or two, but Noim 
caught me by the elbow and 
stolidly led me outside to begin my 
journey away from my homeland. 



I INSISTED on opening myself 
to a drainer before leaving Salla 
City. I had not planned on doing 
so and it irritated Noim that I took 
the time for it; but an uncon- 
trollable yearning for the com- 
forts of religion rose up in me as we 
neared the outskirts of the capital. 

A TIME OF CHANGES 



We had been traveling almost 
an hour. The rain had thickened 
and gusty winds slammed it 
against the windscreens of our 
groundcars, so that cautious driv- 
ing was in order. The cobbled 
streets were slippery. Noim drove 
one of the cars, I sitting sullenly 
beside him; the other, with our ser- 
vants, followed close behind. The 
morning was young and the city 
still slept. Each passing street was a 
surgery to me, for a segment of 
my life was ripped off by it: there 
goes the palace compound, there 
go the spires of the House of 
Justice, there the university's 
great gray blocky buildings, there 
the godhouse where my royal 
father brought me into the 
Covenant, there the Museum of 
Mankind that 1 visited so often 
with my mother to stare at the trea- 
sures from the stars. Circling 
through the fine residential district 
that borders the Skangen Canal, I 
even spied the ornate townhouse 
of the Duke of Kongoroi, on 
whose handsome daughter’s silken 
bedsheets I had left my virginity 
in a clammy puddle, not too many 
years before. In this city 1 had 
lived all my life and I might never 
see it again; my yesterdays were 
washing away, like the topsoil of 
Salla’s sad farms under the knives 
of the winter rains. Since boyhood 
1 had known that one day my 
brother would be septarch and this 
city would cease to have a place for 
me, but yet I had denied that to 

41 




myself, saying, It will not hap- 
pen soon, perhaps it will not hap- 
pen at all. And my father lay dead 
in his firethorn coffin; my brother 
crouched beneath the awful 
weight of his crown and I was flee- 
ing from Salla before my life had 
fairly begun. And such a mood of 
self-pity came over me that I did 
not dare even to speak to Noim, 
though what is a bondbrother for 
if not to ease one’s soul? And when 
we were driving through the ram- 
shackle streets of Salla Old Town, 
not far from the city walls, 1 spied a 
dilapidated godhouse and said to 
Noim, “Pull up at the corner here. 
One must go within to empty him- 
self." 

Noim, fretful, did not want to 
spare the time and made as if to 
drive on. “Would you deny one the 
godright?" I asked him hotly and 
only then, simmering and cross, 
did he halt the car and back it up to 
let me out by the godhouse. 

Its face was worn and peeling. 
An inscription beside the door was 
illegible. The pavement before it 
was cracked and tilted. Salla Old 
Town has a pedigree of more than 
a thousand years; some of its 
buildings have been continuously 
inhabited since the founding of 
the city, though most are in ruins, 
for the life of that district ended, in 
effect, when one of the medieval 
septarchs chose to move his court 
to our present palace atop Skan- 
gen Hill, much to the south. At 
night Salla Old Town comes alive 



with pleasure-seekers, who guzzle 
the blue wine in cellar cabarets, 
but at this misty hour it was a grim 
place. Blank stone walls faced me 
from every building; we have a 
fashion of making mere slits serve 
for windows in Salla, but here they 
carried it to an extreme. 1 
wondered if the godhouse could 
have a scanning machine in work- 
ing order to watch my approach. 
Yes, as it happened. When I 
neared the godhouse dogr it swung 
partly open and a scrawny man in 
drainer’s robes looked out. He was 
ugly, of course. Who ever saw a 
handsome drainer? It is a pro- 
fession for the ill-favored. This 
one had greenish skin, heavily 
pocked, and a rubbery snout of a 
nose and a dimness in one eye; 
standard for his trade. He gave me 
a fishy stare and, by his wariness, 
seemed to be regretting having 
opened the door. 

“The peace of all gods be on 
you," I said. “Here is one in need 
of your craft.” 

He eyed my costly costume, my 
leather jerkin and my heavy jewel- 
ry, studied the size and swagger of 
me and evidently concluded I was 
some young bully of the aristo- 
cracy out to stir trouble in the 
slums. 

“It is to early in the day,” he 
said uneasily. “You come too 
soon for comfort." 

“You would not refuse a 
sufferer." 

“It is too early.”

“Come, come, let one in. A 
troubled soul stands here." 



H E YIELDED, as I knew he 
must, and with many a twitch 
of his longnosed face he admitted 
me. Within there was the reek of 
rot. The old woodwork was im- 
pregnated with the damp, the drap- 
eries were moldering, the furniture 
had been gnawed by insects. The 
lighting was dim. The drainer’s 
wife, as ugly as the drainer him- 
self, skulked about. He led me to 
his chapel, a small sweaty room 
off the living-quarters, and left me 
kneeling by the cracked and 
yellowing mirror while he lit the 
candles. He robed himself and 
finally came to me where I kneeled. 
He named his fee. I gasped. 

"Too much by half,” I said. 

He reduced it by a fifth. When 1 
still refused, he told me to find my 
priesting elsewhere, but I would 
not rise and, grudgingly, he 
brought the price of his services 
down another notch. Still it was 
probably five limes what he 
charged the folk of Salla Old Town 
for the same benefit, but he knew I 
had money and, thinking of Noim 
fuming in the car, I could not 
bring myself to haggle. 

“Done," I said. 

Next he brought me the con- 
tract. I have said that we of Bor- 
than are suspicious people; have I 
indicated how we rely on con- 
tracts?. A man’s word is merely bad 



air. Before a soldier beds a whore 
they come to the terms of their bar- 
gain and scrawl it on paper. The 
drainer gave me a standard form, 
promising me that all I said would 
be held in strictest confidence, 
the drainer merely acting as inter- 
mediary between me and the god 
of my choice and I, for my part, 
pledging that I would hold the 
drainer to no liability for the 
knowledge he would have of me, 
that I would not call him as wit- 
ness in a lawsuit or make him my 
alibi in some prosecution, et 
cetera, et cetera. I signed. He 
signed. We exchanged copies and I 
gave him his money. 

“Which god would you have pre- 
side here?” he asked. 

“The god who protects 
travelers,” I told him. We do not 
call our gods aloud by their names. 

He lit a candle of the appro- 
priate color pink- and put it be- 
side the mirror. By that it was un- 
derstood that the chosen god 
would accept my words. 

“Behold your face," the drainer 
said. “Put your eyes to your eyes." 

I stared at the mirror. Since we 
shun vanity, it is not usual to 
examine one’s face except on these 
occasions of religion. 

“Open now your soul,” the 
drainer commanded. “Let your 
griefs and dreams and hungers and 
sorrows emerge.” 

“A septarch’s son it is who flees 
his homeland,” I began and at 
once the drainer jerked to atten-

tion, impaled by my news. Though 
I did not take my eyes from the 
mirror, I guessed that he was 
scrabbling around to look at the 
contract and see who had signed 
it. “Fear of his brother," I con- 
tinued, “leads him to go abroad, 
but yet he is sore of soul as he de- 
parts." 

I went on in that vein for some 
while. The drainer made the usual 
interjections every time 1 faltered, 
prying words out of me in his 
craft’s cunning way. But shortly 
there was no need for such mid- 
wivery, for the words gushed freely. 
1 told him of my desire for my 
bondsister and how her embrace 
had unsettled me; 1 told him how 
close I had come to lying to Stir- 
ron; I confessed that 1 would miss 
the royal wedding and give my 
brother injury thereby; 1 ad- 
mitted several small sins of self-es- 
teem, such as anyone commits 
daily. 

The drainer listened. 

We pay them to listen and to do 
nothing but listen, until we are 
drained and healed. Such is our 
holy communion that we lift these 
toads from the mud, set them up in 
their godhouses and buy their 
patience with our money. It is per- 
mitted under the Covenant to say 
anything to a drainer, even if it is 
drivel, even if it is a shameful cata- 
log of throttled lusts and hidden 
filth. We may bore a drainer as we 
have no right to bore our bondkin, 
for it is the drainer’s obligation 



by contract to sit with the patience 
of the hills as we speak of our- 
selves. We need not worry what the 
drainer’s problems may be, nor 
what he thinks of us, nor whether 
he would be happier doing some- 
thing else. He has his calling and he 
takes his fee and he must serve 
those who have need of him. A 
time was when I felt it was a 
miraculously fine scheme to give 
us drainers in order that we might 
rid our hearts of pain. Too much of 
my life was gone before I realized 
that to open one's self to a drainer 
is no more comforting than to 
make love to one’s own hand: there 
are better ways of loving, there 
are happier ways of opening. 

But I did not know that then and 
I squatted by the mirror, getting 
the best healing that money could 
buy. Whatever residue of wrong- 
ness was in my soul came forth, 
syllable smoothly following syl- 
lable, the way sweet liquor will flow 
when one taps the thorny flanks of 
the gnarled and repellent-looking 
flesh-trees that grow by the Gulf of 
Sumar. As I spoke the candles 
caught me in their spell and by the 
flickering of them I was drawn in- 
to the curved surface of the mir- 
ror so that I was drawn out of my- 
self; the drainer was a mere blur in 
the darkness, unreal, unim- 
portant, and I spoke now directly 
to the god of travelers, who would 
heal me and send me on my way. 
And I believed that this was so. I 
will not say that 1 imagined a 



44 



GALAXY 




literal god-place where our deities 
sit on call to serve us, but 1 had 
then an abstract and metaphori- 
cal understanding of our religion 
by which it seemed to me, in its 
way, as real as my right arm. 

My flow of words halted and the 
drainer made no attempt to renew 
the outpour. He murmured the 
phrases of absolution, snuffed the 
god-candle between two fingers 
and rose to doff his robes. Still I 
kneeled, weak and quivering from 
my draining, lost in reveries. I felt 
cleansed and purified, stripped of 
my soul’s grit and debris and, in the 
music of that moment, was only 
dimly aware of the squalor about 
me. The chapel was a place of 
magic and the drainer was aflame 
with divine beauty. 

“Up,” he said, nudging me with 
the tip of his sandal. “Out. Off 
about your journeys.” 

The sound of his splintery voice 
doused all the wonder. I stood 
up, shaking my head to cure it of 
its new lightness, while the drainer 
pushed me into the corridor. He 
was no longer afraid of me, that 
ugly little man, even though I 
might be a septarch’s son and 
could kill him with one wad of my 
spittle, for I had told him of my 
cowardice, of my forbidden 
hunger for Halum, of all the cheap- 
nesses of my spirit. And that 
knowledge reduced me in his 
eyes: no man newly drained can 
awe his drainer. 

The rain was even worse when I 



left the building. Noim sat 
scowling in the car, his forehead 
pressed to the steering stick. He 
looked up and tapped his wrist to 
tell me I had dallied too long at the 
godhouse. 

“Feel better now that your blad- 
der's empty?" he asked. 

“What?” 

“That is, did you have a good 
soul-pissing in there?” 

“A foul phrase, Noim.” 

“One grows blasphemous when 
his patience is extended too far.” 

He kicked the starter and we 
rolled forward. Shortly we were at 
the ancient walls of Salla City, by 
the noble tower-bedecked opening 
known as Glin Door, which was 
guarded by four sour-faced and 
sleepy warriors in dripping uni- 
forms. They paid no heed to us. 
Noim drove through the gate and 
past a sign welcoming us to the 
Grand Salla Highway. Salla City 
dwindled swiftly behind us; north- 
ward we rushed toward Glin. 



T HE Grand Salla Highway 
passes through one of our best 
farming districts, the rich and 
fertile Plain of Nand, which each 
spring receives a gift of topsoil 
stripped from the skin of West 
Salla by our busy streams. At that 
time the septarch of the Nand dis- 
trict was a notorious coinclutcher 
and, thanks to his penury, the high- 
way was in poor repair there, so, 
as Halum had predicted in jest, we 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



45 




were hard put to wallow through 
the mud that clogged the road. It 
was good to finish with Nand and 
enter North Salla, where the land is 
a mixture of rock and sand and the 
people live on weeds and on scut- 
tling things that they take from the 
sea. Groundcars are unusual 
sights in North Salla and twice we 
were stoned by hungry and sullen 
townsfolk, who found our mere 
passage through their unhappy 
place an insult. But at least the 
road was free of mud. 

Noim’s father’s troops were 
stationed in extreme North Salla, 
on the lower bank of the River 
Huish. This is the grandest of 
Velada Borlhan’s rivers. It begins 
as a hundred trifling brooks 
trickling down the eastern slopes of 
the Huishtors in the northern part 
of West Salla; these brooks merge 
in the foothills to become a swift 
stream, gray and turbulent, that 
rushes through a narrow granite 
canyon marked by six great step- 
like plunges. Emerging from those 
wild cascades onto its alluvial 
plain, the Huish proceeds more 
serenely on a northeastern course 
toward the sea, growing wider 
and wider in the flatlands and 
splitting ultimately so that, at its 
broad delta, it gives itself to the 
ocean through eight mouths. In its 
rapid western reaches the Huish 
forms the boundary between Salla 
and Glin; at its placid easternmost 
end it divides Glin from Krell. 

For all its length the great river 



is unbridged and one might think 
little need exists to fortify its 
banks against invaders from the 
far side. But many times in Salla's 
history have the men of Glin 
crossed the Huish by boat to make 
war and just as many times have we 
of Salla gone to ravage Glin, nor is 
the record of neighborliness be- 
tween Glin and Krell any happier. 
So all along the Huish sprout mili- 
tary outposts, and generals like 
Luinn Condorit consume their 
lives studying the riverfogs for 
glimpses of the enemy. 

1 stayed a short while at Noim's 
father’s camp. The general was not 
much like Noim, being a large- 
featured, heavy man whose face, 
eroded by time and frustration, 
was like a contour map of 
bouldery North Salla. Not once in 
fifteen years had there been any 
significant clash along the border 
he guarded and 1 think that idle- 
ness had chilled his soul; he said lit- 
tle, scowled often, turned every 
statement into a bitter grumble 
and retreated speedily from con- 
versation into private dreams. 
They must have been dreams of 
war; no doubt he could not glance 
at the river without wishing that it 
swarmed with the landing-craft of 
Glin. 

A dull time we had of it there. 
Noim was bound by filial ties to 
call upon his father, but they had 
nothing to say to one another and 
the general was a stranger to me. 1 
had told Stirron I would stay with 



46 



GALAXY 




Noim's father until the first snow 
of winter fell and 1 was true to my 
word, yet, luckily it was no lengthy 
visit 1 made; winter comes early in 
the north. On my fifth day there 
white sprinkles fluttered down and 
1 was released from my self-im- 
posed pledge. 

Ferries, shuttling between 
terminals in three places, link Salla 
to Glin, except in time of war. 
Noim drove me to the nearest 
terminal one black dawn and 
solemly we embraced and made 
our farewells. I said I would send 
my address, when I had one in 
Glin, so that he could keep me in- 
formed of doings in Salla. He 
promised to look after Halum. We 
talked vaguely of when he and she 
and I would meet again; perhaps 
they would visit me in Glin next 
year, perhaps we would all three 
go on holiday in Manneran. We 
made these plans with little con- 
viction in our voices. Then we had 
no words left. 

The ferry beckoned me with a 
bellow of its horn. 

1 clasped Noim's arm and we 
made farewells, hurriedly. The 
last thing 1 said to him was, “When 
you see the septarch, tell him that 
his brother loves him." Then I went 
aboard. 

The crossing was too quick. Less 
than an hour and I found myself 
on the alien soil of Glin. The 
immigration officials examined 
me brusquely, but they thawed at 
the sight of my passport, bright 



red to denote my place in the 
nobility, wih a golden stripe to 
show that 1 was of the septarch's 
family. At once 1 had my visa, 
good for an indefinite stay. Such 
officials are a gossipy sort; beyond 
question they were on the tele- 
phone the instant 1 left them, send- 
ing word to their government that 
a prince of Salla was in the 
land — and I suppose that not 
much later that bit of information 
was in the hands of Salla’s diplo- 
matic representatives in Glin, 
who would relay it to my brother 
for his displeasure. 

Across the way from the 
customs shed I came upon a branch 
of the Covenant Sank of Glin and 
exchanged my Salla money for the 
currency of the northerners. With 
my new funds I hired a driver to 
take me to the capital city, which 
they call Glain, half a day's journey 
north of the border. 

The road was narrow and wind- 
ing and traversed a bleak country- 
side where winter’s touch had long 
ago pulled the leaves from the 
trees. Dirty snow was banked high. 
Glin is a frosty province. It was 
settled by men of a puritan 
nature, who found the living too 
easy in Salla and felt that if they re- 
mained there they might be 
tempted away from the Covenant; 
failing to reform our forefathers 
into greater piety, they left, cross- 
ing the Huish by rafts to hack out a 
livelihood in the north. Hard folk 
for a hard land; however poor the

farming is in Salla it is twice as 
unrewarding in Glin; there 
people live mainly by fishing, by 
manufacturing, by the juggle- 
ments of commercial dealings 
and by piracy. But that my mother 
had sprung from Glin, I would 
never have chosen it for my place 
of exile. Not that I gained anything 
from my family ties. 

V 

N IGHTFALL saw me in Glain. 

A walled city it is, like Salla’s 
capital, but otherwise not much 
like it. Salla City has grace and 
power; its buildings are made of 
great blocks of 'substantial stone, 
black basalt and rosy granite 
quarried in the mountains, and its 
streets are wide and sweeping, 
affording noble vistas and 
splendid promenades. Our custom 
of letting narrow slits stand in 
place of true windows apart, Salla 
City is an open, inviting place, the 
architecture of which announces 
to the world the boldness and self- 
sufficiency of its citizens. But that 
dismal Glain! Oh! 

Glain is fashioned of scruffy yel- 
low brick, here and there trimmed 
with miserable poor pink sand- 
stone that rubs to particles at a 
finger's nudge. It has no streets, 
only alleyways; the houses jostle 
one another as if afraid that some 
interloper may try to slip be- 
tween them if they relax their 
guard. An avenue in Glain would 



not impress a gutter in Salla. And 
the architects of Glain have cre- 
ated a city fit only for a nation of 
drainers, since everything is lop- 
sided, awry, uneven and coarse. 
My brother, who had once been 
to Glain on a diplomatic errand, 
had described the place to me, but 
I put his harsh words off to mere 
patriotic prejudice; now I saw that 
Stirron had been too kind. 

Nor were the folk of Glain more 
lovely than their city. On a world 
where suspicion and secrecy are 
godly virtues one expects to find 
charm in short supply; yet I found 
the Glainish virtuous beyond all 
necessity. Dark clothes, dark 
frowns, dark souls, closed and 
shrunken hearts. Their speech it- 
self displays their constipation of 
spirit. The language of Glin is the 
same as that of Salla, though the 
northerners have pronounced ac- 
cents, clipping their syllables and 
shifting their vowels. That did not 
disturb me, but their syntax of 
self-effacement did. My driver, 
who was not a city man and there- 
fore seemed almost friendly, left 
me at a hostelry where he thought I 
would have kind treatment. 

I entered and said, “One would 
have a room for tonight and for 
some days beyond this one, per- 
haps." 

The innkeeper stared balefully 
at me as if 1 had said, “/ would 
have a room " or something 
equally filthy. Later I discovered 
that even our usual polite cir- 



48 



GALAXY 




cumlocution seems too vain for a 
northerner; I should not have said, 
“One would have a room — ” but 
rather, “Is there a room to be 
had?” At a restaurant it is wrong to 
say, “One will dine on thus and 
thus — “ but rather, “These are the 
dishes that have been chosen." And 
so on and so on, twisting every- 
thing into a cumbersome passive 
form to avoid the sin of acknowl- 
edging one's own existence. 

For my ignorance the innkeeper 
gave me his meanest room and 
charged me twice the usual tariff. 
By my speech I had branded my- 
self a man of Salla; why should he 
be courteous? But in signing the 
contract for my night's lodgings I 
had to show him my passport, 
which made him gasp when he saw 
that he was host to a visiting 
prince; he softened more than a lit- 
tle, asking me if I would have wine 
sent to my room, or maybe a 
buxom Glainish wench. I took the 
wine but declined the wench, for I 
was very young and overly 
frightened of the diseases that 
might lurk in foreign loins. That 
night I sat alone in my room, 
watching snowflakes drowning 
in a murky canal below my 
window and feeling more isolated 
from humanity than ever before, 
ever since. 



O VER a week passed before I 
found the courage to call upon 
my mother's kin. I strolled the city 



for hours every day, keeping my 
cloak wrapped close against the 
winds and marveling at the ugli- 
ness of all I beheld, people and 
structures. I located the embassy of 
Salla and lurked outside it, not 
wishing to go in but merely 
cherishing the link to my home- 
land that the squat grim building 
provided. I bought heaps of 
cheaply printed books and read far 
into the night to learn something 
of my adopted province: there was 
a history of Glin, a guidebook to 
the city of Glain and an inter- 
minable epic poem dealing with 
the founding of the first settle- 
ments north of the Huish and much 
else. I dissolved my loneliness in 
wine not the wine of Glin, for 
none is made there, but rather the 
good sweet golden wine of 
Manneran, that they import in 
giant casks. I slept poorly. One 
night I dreamed that Stirron had 
died of a fit and a search was being 
made for me. Several times in my 
sleep I saw the hornfowl strike my 
father dead; this is a dream that 
still haunts me, coming twice or 
thrice a year. 1 wrote long letters 
to Halum and Noim and tore them 
up, for they stank of self-pity. 1 
wrote one to Stirron, begging him 
to forgive me for fleeing, and tore 
that up too. When all else failed I 
asked the innkeeper for a wench. 
He sent me a skinny girl a year or 
two older than I, with odd large 
breasts that dangled like inflated 
rubber bags.

“It is said you are a prince of 
Salla,” she declared coyly, lying 
down and parting her thighs. 

Without replying I covered her 
and she wriggled her hips so 
fiercely that the end came for me 
within half a moment. I was 
angered at myself and turned my 
wrath on her. She ran from my 
room still naked, terrified more, I 
think, by my obscenities than by 
my wrath. 

I soaped myself for an hour 
afterward. In my naivete I feared 
that the innkeeper would evict me 
for speaking vulgarly to her, but 
he said nothing. Even in Glin, one 
need not be polite to whores. 

I realized that there had been a 
strange pleasure in shouting those 
words at her. I yielded to curious 
reveries of fantasy, in which I 
imagined the big-breasted slut 
naked on my bed, while 1 stood 
over her crying, I! I! I! I! I! Two 
nights later, I asked the innkeeper 
for another wench. 

Thus I spent my patrimony in 
the capital of puritan Glin, 
wenching and drinking and loiter- 
ing. When the stench of my own 
idleness offended me I put down 
my timidity and went to see my 
Glainish relatives. 

My mother had been a daughter 
of a prime septarch of Glin; he was 
dead, as was his son and successor; 
now his son’s son, Truis, my 
mother’s nephew, held the throne. 
It seemed too forward to me to go 
seeking preferment from my 



royal cousin directly. Truis of Glin 
would have to weigh matters of 
state as well as matters of kinship 
and might not want to aid the run- 
away of Salla’s prime septarch, 
lest it lead him into friction with 
Stirron. But I had an aunt, Nioll, 
my mother’s younger sister, who 
had often been in Salla City in my 
mother’s lifetime and who had 
held me fondly when I was a babe; 
would she not help me? 

She had married power to 
power. Her husband was the 
Marquis of Huish, who held great 
influence at the septarch’s court, 
and also — for in Glin it is not 
thought unseemly for the nobility 
to dabble in commerce — con- 
trolled his province’s wealthiest 
factor-house. These factor-houses 
are something akin to banks, but 
of another species; they lend money 
to brigands and merchants and 
lords of industry, only at ruinous 
rates and always taking a slice of 
ownership in any enterprise they 
aid; thus they insinuate their 
tentacles into a hundred organi- 
zations and attain immense 
leverage in economic matters. In 
Salla the factor-houses were for- 
bidden a century ago, but in Glin 
they" thrive almost as a second 
government. 1 had no love for the 
system, but I preferred joining it 
to begging. 

Some inquiries at the inn gained 
me directions to the palace of the 
marquis. By Glainish standards it 
was an imposing structure of three 



50 



GALAXY 




interlocking wings beside a 
mirror-smooth artificial lake in 
the aristocrats’ sector of the city. I 
made no attempt to talk my way 
inside; I had come prepared with 
a note, informing the marquise 
that her nephew Kinnall, the sep- 
tarch’s son of Salla, was in Glain 
and wished the favor of an 
audience; he could be found at 
such-and-such a hostelry. I re- 
turned to my lodgings and 
waited«and on the third day the 
innkeeper, popeyed with "awe, 
came to my room to tell me 1 had a 
visitor in the livery of the Marquis 
of Huish. Nioll had sent a car for 
me; I was taken to her palace, 
which was far more lavish within 
than without, and she received me 
in a great hall cunningly paneled 
with mirrors set at angles to other 
mirrors to create an illusion of in- 
finity. 



S HE had aged greatly in the six 
or seven years I last had seen 
her, but my amazement at her 
white hair and furrowed face was 
swallowed up in her astonish- 
ment over my transformation 
from tiny child to hulking man in 
so short a time. We embraced in 
the style of Glin, fingertips to 
fingertips; she offered condo- 
lences on the death of my father 
and apologies for not having 
attended Stirron’s coronation; 
then she asked me what brought 
me to Glin. 1 explained and she 



showed no surprise. Did 1 propose 
to dwell here permanently? 1 did, 
I said. And how would I support 
myself? By working in the factor- 
house of her husband, I ex- 
plained, if such a position could be 
procured for me. She did not act as 
though she found my ambition un- 
reasonable, but merely asked if I 
had any skills that might recom- 
mend me to the marquis. To this I 
replied that I had been trained in 
the law codes of Salla (not 
mentioning how incomplete my 
training was) and might be of 
value in the factor-house’s deal- 
ings with that province; also, 1 said, 
I had connections of bonding to 
Segvord Helalam, High Justice 
of the Port in Manneran, and could 
serve the firm well in its Manneran 
business; lastly, 1 remarked, 1 
was young and strong and ambi- 
tious and would place myself 
wholly in the service of the factor- 
house’s interests, for our mutual 
advantage. These statements 
seemed to sit smoothly with my 
aunt and she promised to gain for 
me an interview with the marquis 
himself. I left her palace much 
pleased with my prospects. 

Several days later came word to 
the hostelry that I should present 
myself at the offices of the factor- 
house. My appointment, how- 
ever, was not with the Marquis of 
Huish; rather, I was to see one of 
his executives, a certain Sisgar. 1 
should have taken that as an omen. 
This man was smooth to the point

of oiliness, with a beardless face 
and no eyebrows and a bald head 
that looked as if it had been waxed. 
He wore a dark green robe that was 
at once properly austere and subtly 
ostentatious. He questioned me 
briefly about my training and 
experience, discovering in some 
ten queries that I had had little of 
the former and none of the latter; 
but he exposed my failings in a 
gentle and amiable way and I 
assumed that despite my ignor- 
ance my high birth and kinship to 
the marquise would gain me a 
post. Alas for complacency! I had 
begun to hatch a dream of climb- 
ing to great responsibilities in this 
factor-house when I caught with 
only half an ear the words of 
Sisgar, telling me, “Times are 
hard, as surely your grace compre- 
hends, and it is unfortunate that 
you come to us at a time when re- 
trenching is necessary. The 
advantages of giving you employ- 
ment are many, yet the problems 
are extreme. The marquis wishes 
you to know that your offer of 
service was greatly appreciated and 
it is his hope to bring you into the 
firm when economic conditions 
permit.” With many bows and a 
pleasant smile of dismissal he 
drove me from his office and I was 
on the street before I realized how 
thoroughly I had been destroyed. 
They could give me nothing, not 
even a fifth assistant clerkship in 
some village office! How was this 
possible? I nearly rushed back 



within, planning to cry. This is a 
mistake — you deal with your sep- 
larch's cousin here — you reject the 
nephew of the marquise! But they 
knew those things and yet they shut 
their doors to me. When 1 
telephoned my aunt to express my 
shock 1 was told that she had gone 
abroad to pass the winter in leafy 
Manneran. 



E ventually what had oc- 
curred became clear to me. My 
aunt had spoken of me to the mar- 
quis and the marquis had con- 
ferred with the septarch Truis, 
who, concluding that it might em- 
barrass him with Stirron to allow 
me any kind of employ, instructed 
the marquis to turn me away. In 
my fury I thought of going 
straight to Truis to protest, but I 
saw the futility of that soon enough 
and, since my protector, Nioll, had 
plainly gone out of Glin to shake 
herself free of me I knew there was 
no hope in that direction. 1 was 
alone in Glain with the winter com- 
ing on and held no position in this 
alien place, where my lofty birth 
was worse than useless to me. 
Harder blows followed. 
Presenting myself at the Cove- 
nant Bank of Glin one morning to 
withdraw funds for living ex- 
penses, I learned that my account 
had been sequestered at the 
request of the Grand Treasurer of 
Salla, who was investigating the 
possibility of an illegal transfer of

capital out of that province. By 
blustering and waving my royal 
passport about, I managed to 
break loose enough money for 
seven days' food and lodging, but 
the rest of my savings was lost to 
me, for I had no stomach for the 
kind of appeals and maneuvers 
that might free it. 

Next I was visited at my hostelry 
by a diplomat of Salla, a jackal of 
an undersecretary who reminded 
me, with many a genuflection and 
formula of respect, that my 
brother’s wedding would shortly 
lake place and I was expected to 
return and serve as a ring-linker. 
Knowing that I would never leave 
Salla City again if ever I gave my- 
self into Stirron’s hands, I ex- 
plained that urgent business re- 
quired me to remain in Glain dur- 
ing the season of the nuptials and 
asked that my deep regrets be con- 
veyed to the septarch. The under- 
secretary received this with pro- 
fessional grace, but it was not hard 
for me to detect the savage gleam 
of pleasure beneath his outer 
mask: I was buying me trouble, he 
was telling himself, and he would 
gladly help me close the contract. 

On the fourth day thereafter my 
innkeeper came to tell me that 1 
could no longer stay at the hostel- 
ry, for my passport had been 
revoked and I had no legal status in 
Cilin. 

This was an impossibility. A 
royal passport such as I carried is 
granted for life and is valid in every 



province of Velada Borthan ex- 
cept in times of war; and there was 
no war at the moment between 
Salla and Glin. The innkeeper 
shrugged away my words; he 
showed me his notice from the 
police, ordering him to evict his 
illegal alien, and he suggested that 
if 1 had objections I should take 
the matter up with the appro- 
priate bureau of the Glinish civil 
service. 1 regarded filing such an 
appeal as unwise. My eviction 
had not come about by accident 
and should I appear at any govern- 
_ment office I was likely to find 
myself arrested and hustled across 
the Huish into Stirron’s grasp 
forthwith. 

Seeing such an arrest as the most 
probable next development, I 
wondered how to elude the govern- 
ment agents. Now I sorely felt the 
absence of my bondbrother and 
bondsister, for where else could I 
turn for help and advice? No- 
where in Glin was there anyone to 
whom I might say, One is fright- 
ened, one is in grave- peril, one 
asks assistance of you. Everyone’s 
soul was walled against me by 
stony custom. In all the world 
were only two whom I could re- 
gard as confidants and they were 
far away. I must find my own sal- 
vation. 

I would go into hiding, I de- 
cided. The innkeeper granted me a 
few hours to prepare myself. I 
shaved my beard, traded my royal 
cloak for the dim rags of another

lodger nearly my height and 
arranged the pawn of my ring of 
ceremony. My remaining posses- 
sions I bundled together to serve 
as a hump on my back, and I hob- 
bled out of the hostelry doubled 
up, with one eye sealed shut and 
my mouth twisted far around to 
one side. Whether it was a disguise 
that could have fooled anyone, 1 
cannot say; but no one waited to 
arrest me, and thus uglified 1 
walked out of Glain under a cold, 
thin rain that soon turned to snow. 



VI 

O UTSIDE the city's northwest- 
ern gate (for it was there my 
feet had taken me) a heavy truck 
came rumbling by me and its 
treads rolled through a pool of 
half-frozen slush, spraying me 
liberally. I halted to scrape the 
chilly stuff from my leggings; the 
truck halted, too, and the driver 
clambered down, exclaiming. 
“There is cause for apology here. It 
was not intended to douse you 
so!” 

This courtesy so astounded me 
that I stood to my full height and 
let the distortions slip from my 
features. Evidently the driver had 
thought me a feeble, bent old man; 
he showed amazement at my trans- 
formation and laughed aloud. I 
knew not what to say. 

Into my gaping silence he de- 
clared, “There is room for one, to 



ride, if you have the need or the 
whim.” 

Into my mind sprang a bright 
fantasy: he would drive me toward 
the coast, where 1 would sign on 
aboard a merchant vessel bound 
for Manneran, and in that happy 
tropical land 1 would throw my- 
self on the mercies of my bondsis- 
ter’s father, escaping all this 
harrassment. 

“Where are you bound?” I 
asked. 

“Westward, into the moun- 
tains.” 

So much for Manneran. I 
accepted the ride all the same. He 
offered me no contract of de- 
fined liabilities, but I let that pass. 
For some minutes we did not 
speak; I was content to listen to 
the slap of the treads on the snowy 
road and think of the distance 
growing between myself and the 
police of Glain. 

“Outlander, are you?” he asked 
at last. 

“Indeed.” Fearing that some 
alarm might be out for a man of 
Salla, I chose belatedly to adopt 
the soft slurred speech of southern 
folk that I had learned from 
Halum, hoping he would come to 
believe that I had not spoken first 
to him with Sallan accents. “You 
travel with a native of Manneran, 
who finds your winter a strange 
and burdensome thing.” 

“What brought you north?” he 
asked. 

“The settlement of one’s 



54 



GALAXY 




mother’s estate. She was a woman 
of Glain.” 

"Did the lawyers treat you well, 
then?” 

"Her money melted in their 
hands, leaving nothing." 

"The usual story. You’re short 
of cash, eh?” 

“Desitute,” I admitted. 

"Well, well, one understands 
your situation, for one has been 
there oneself. Perhaps something 
can be done for you.” 

1 realized from his phrasing, 
from his failure to use the Glinish 
passive construction, that he, too, 
must be an outlander. Swinging 
round to face him, 1 asked, “Is one 
right that you likewise are from 
elsewhere?” 

“This is true.” 

“Your accent is unfamiliar. 
Some western province?” 

“Oh, no, no.” 

“Not Salla, then?” 

“Manneran,” he said and burst 
into hearty laughter. He covered 
my shame and confusion by telling 
me, "You do the accent well, 
friend. But you needn’t make the 
effort longer.” 

"One hears no Manneran in 
your voice,” I mumbled. 

“One has lived long in Glin,” he 
said, “and one’s voice is a soup of 
inflections.” 

I had not fooled him for a 
moment, but he made no attempts 
to penetrate my identity and 
seemed not to care who 1 might be 
or where I came from. We talked 

ATIME OF CHANGES 



easily a while. He told me that he 
owned a lumber mill in western 
Glin, midway up the flanks of the 
Huishtors where the tall yellow- 
needled honey-trees grow; before 
we had driven much farther along 
he was offering me a job as a log- 
ger in his camp. The pay was poor, 
he said, but one breathed clean air 
there, government officials were 
never seen and such things as pass- 
ports and certificates of status did 
not matter. 

O F COURSE 1 accepted. His 
camp was beautifully situated 
above a sparkling mountain lake 
which never froze, for it was fed by 
a warm spring whose source was 
said to be deep beneath the Burnt 
Lowlands. Tremendous ice-topped 
Huishtor peaks hung above us and 
not far away was Glin Gate, the 
pass through which one goes from 
Glin to the Burnt Lowlands, cross- 
ing a bitter corner of the Frozen 
Lowlands on the way. He had a 
hundred men in his employ, 
rough and foul-mouthed, forever 
shouting “1” and “me” without 
shame, but they were honest and 
hardworking men and 1 had never 
been close to their sort before. My 
plan was to stay there through the 
winter, saving my pay, and go off 
to Manneran when 1 had earned 
the price of my passage. Some 
news of the outer world reached the 
camp from time to time, though, 
and I learned in this way that the 
Glinish authorities were seeking a 

55 




certain young prince of Salla, who 
was believed to have gone insane 
and was wandering somewhere in 
Glin; the septarch Stirron urgently 
wished the unhappy young man to 
be returned to his homeland for 
the medical care he so desperately 
needed. Suspecting that the roads 
and ports would be watched, 1 
extended my stay in the mountains 
through the spring and, my caution 
deepening, I stayed the summer 
also. In the end I spent something 
more than a year there. 

It was a year that changed me 
greatly. We worked hard, felling 
the huge trees in all weathers, strip- 
ping boughs, feeding them to the 
mill. Long, tiring days they were, 
and chilly ones -but followed by 
plenty of hot wine at night and 
every tenth day a platoon of 
women were brought in from a 
nearby town to amuse us. My 
weight increased by half again, all 
of it hard muscle, and I grew taller 
until I surpassed the tallest logger 
in the camp and the gthers made 
jokes about my size. My beard 
came in full and the planes of my 
face changed as the plumpness of 
youth went from me. I found the 
loggers more likable than the 
courtiers among whom all my prior 
days had been passed. Few of them 
were able even to read and of polite 
etiquette they knew nothing, but 
they were cheerful and easy- 
spirited men, at home in their own 
bodies. I would not have you think 
that because they talked in “I" 



and “me” they were open-hearted 
and given to sharing of confi- 
dences; they kept the Covenant in 
that respect and might even have 
been more secretive than educated 
folk about certain things. Yet they 
seemed more sunny of soul than 
those who speak in passives and 
impersonal pronouns and perhaps 
my stay among them planted in me 
that seed of subversion, that 
understanding of the Covenant's 
basic wrongness, which the Earth- 
man Schweiz later guided into full 
(lowering. 

I told them nothing of my rank 
and origin. They could see for 
themselves, by the smoothness of 
my skin, that 1 had not done much 
hard labor in my life and my way 
of speaking marked me as an 
educated man, if not necessarily 
one of high birth. But I offered no 
revelations of my past and none 
were sought. All I said was that I 
came from Salla, since my accent 
marked me as Sail an anyway; 
they granted me the privacy of my 
history. My employer, I think, 
guessed early that I must be the 
fugitive prince whom Stirron 
sought, but he never queried me 
about that. For the first lime in my 
life, then, I had an identity apart 
from my royal status. 1 ceased to 
be Lord Kinnall, the septarch's 
second son, and was only Darival, 
the big logger from Salla. 

From that transformation I 
learned much. I had never played 
one of your swaggering, bullying 



56 



GALAXY 




young nobles; being a second son 
instills a certain humility even in 
an aristocrat. Yet I could not help 
feeling set apart from ordinary 
men. I was waited on, bowed to, 
served and pampered; men spoke 
softly to me and made formal ges- 
tures of respect even when I was a 
child. 1 was, after all, the son of a 
septarch, that is to say a king, for 
septarchs are hereditary rulers and 
thus are part of mankind’s proces- 
sion of kings, a line that goes back 
to the dawn of human settlement 
on Borthan and beyond, back 
across the stars to Earth itself, to. 
the lost and forgotten dynasties of 
the masked and painted chieftains 
enthroned in prehistoric caves. 
And I was part of that line, a man 
of royal blood, somehow superior 
by circumstance of birth. But in 
this logging camp in the moun- 
tains I came to understand that 
kings are nothing but men set 
high. The gods do not anoint them, 
but rather the will of men, and men 
can strip them of their lofty rank; if 
Stirron were to be cast down by in- 
surrection and in his place that 
loathsome drainer from Salla Old 
Town became septarch, would not 
the drainer then enter that mystic 
procession of kings and Stirron be 
relegated to the dust? And would 
not that drainer’s sons become 
blood-proud, even as I had been, 
although their father had been 
nothing for most of his life and 
their grandfather less than that? I 
know, 1 know, the sages would say 



that the kiss of the gods had fallen 
upon that drainer, elevating him 
and all his progeny and making 
them forever sacred, yet as I felled 
trees on the slopes of the Huish- 
tors I saw kingship with clearer 
eyes and, having been cast down by 
events myself, realized that 1 was 
no more than a man among men 
and always had been. What 1 
would make of myself depended 
on my natural gifts and ambitions, 
not upon the accident of rank. 

0 REWARDING was that 
knowledge and the altered sense 

of self it brought me, that my stay 
in the mountains ceased to seem 
like an exile, became more like a 
vocation. My dreams of fleeing to 
a soft life in Manneran left me 
and, even after I had saved more 
than enough to pay my passage to 
that land, I found myself with no 
impulse to move onward. It was 
not fear of arrest that kept me 
among the loggers, but rather a 
love of the crisp clear cold Huish- 
tor air and of my arduous new 
craft and of the rough but genuine 
men among whom I dwelled. 
Therefore I stayed on, through 
summer and into autumn, and 
welcomed the coming of a new 
winter and gave no thought to go- 
ing. 

1 might be there yet, only I was 
forced into flight. One woeful 
winter afternoon, with the sky like 
iron and the threat of a blizzard 
over us like a fist, they brought the 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



57 




whores up from town for our 
regularly appointed night of frolic 
and this time there was among 
them a newcomer whose voice an- 
nounced her place of birth to be 
Salla. I heard her instantly as the 
women came cavorting into our 
hall of sport, and would have crept 
away, but she spied me and gasped 
and cried out on the spot: “Look 
you there! For sure that is our 
vanished prince!” 

1 laughed and tried to persuade 
everyone that she was drunk or 
mad, but my scarlet cheeks gave 
me the lie and the loggers peered at 
me in a new way. A prince? A 
prince? Was it so? They whispered 
to one another, nudging and wink- 
ing. Recognizing my peril, I 
claimed the woman for my own use 
and drew her aside, and when we 
were alone I insisted to ,her she 
was mistaken: I am no prince, I 
said, but only a common logger. 

She would not have it. 

“The Lord Kinnall marched in 
the septarch’s funeral pro- 
cession,” she said, “and this one 
beheld him with these eyes. And 
you are he!” 

The more 1 protested, the more 
convinced she was. There was no 
shifting her mind. 

Late that night, when the revelry 
had ended, my employer came to 
me, solemn and uneasy. “One of 
the girls has made strange talk 
about you this evening,” he said. 
“If the talk is true you are en- 
dangered, for when she returns to 



her village she'll spread the news 
and the police will be here soon 
enough.” 

“Must one flee, then?” 1 asked. 

“The choice is yours. Alarms 
still are out for this prince; if you 
are he no one here can protect you 
against the authorities." 

“Then one must flee. At day- 
break — " 

“Now,” he said. “While the girl 
still lies here asleep." 

He pressed money of Cdin into 
my hand, over and beyond what he 
owed me in current wages; I 
gathered my few belongings and 
we went outside together. 

The night was moonless and the 
winter wind was savage. By star- 
light I saw the glitter of lightly 
falling snow. My employer silently 
drove me down the slope, past the 
foothills village from which the 
whores came and out along a back- 
country road, which we followed 
for some hours. When dawn met us 
we were in south-central Glin, not 
overly far from the River Huish. 
He halted at last in a village that 
proclaimed itself to be Klaek, a 
winterbound place of small stone 
cottages bordering on broad 
snowly fields. Leaving me in the 
truck, he entered the first of the 
cottages, emerging after a mo- 
ment, accompanied by a wizened 
man who poured forth a torrent of 
instructions and gesticulations; 
with the aid of this guidance we 
found our way to the place my 
employer was seeking, the cottage 



58 



GALAXY 




of a certain farmer named Stum- 
wil. 

This Slumwil was a fair-haired 
man of about my own height, with 
washed-out blue eyes and an apolo- 
getic smile. Maybe he was some 
kinsman of my employer's, or, 
more probably, he owed him a 
debt — I never asked. In any case 
the farmer readily agreed to my 
employer's request and accepted 
me as a lodger. My employer em- 
braced me and drove off into the 
gathering snow; I saw him never 
again. I hope the gods were as kind 
to him as he was to me. 



T HE cottage was one large 
room, divided by flimsy cur- 
tains into areas. Stuniwil put up a 
new curtain, gave me straw for my 
mattress and 1 had my living 
quarters. There were seven of us 
under that roof: Stumwil, myself 
and Stumwil's wife, a weary 
wench whom I could have been 
persuaded to believe to be his 
mother, and three of their chil- 
dren -two boys some years short 
of manhood and a girl in mid- 
adolescence — and the bondsister 
of the girl, who was lodging with 
them that year. They were sunny, 
innocent, trusting folk. Though 
they knew nothing about me, they 
all instantly adopted me as a 
member of the family, some un- 
known uncle unexpectedly re- 
turned from far voyaging. I was 
not prepared for the easy way they 



accepted me and credited it at first 
to some net of obligation in which 
my former employer had bound 
them to me, but no: they were kind- 
ly by nature, unquestioning, un- 
suspicious. I took my meals at their 
table; I sat among them by their 
fire; I joined in their games. Every 
fifth night Stumwil filled a huge 
dented tub with hot water for the 
entire family and I bathed with 
them, two or three of us in the tub 
at once, though it disturbed me in- 
wardly to rub up against the plump 
bare bodies of Stumwil’s daughter 
and her friend. 

I paid a fee for my lodging and 
helped with the chores, though in 
winter there was little to do 
except shovel snow and feed the 
fire. None of them showed 
curiosity about my identity or 
history. They asked no questions 
and I believe that no questions 
ever passed through their minds. 
Nor did the other townspeople 
pry, though they gave me the scru- 
tiny any stranger would receive. 

Some newspapers occasionally 
reached this village and those that 
did went from hand to hand until 
all had read them, when they were 
placed on deposit at the wineshop 
at the head of the main village 
thoroughfare. I consulted them 
there, a file of stained and tattered 
scraps, and learned what I could of 
the events of the past year. I found 
that my brother Stirron’s wedding 
had taken place on schedule, with 
appropriate regal pomp; his lean 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



59 




troubled face looked up out of a 
blurry, grease-splotched bit of old 
paper. Beside him was his radiant 
bride, but I could not make out her 
features. There was tension be- 
tween Glin and Krell over fishing 
rights in a disputed coastal area 
and men had died in border 
skirmishes. 1 pitied General Con- 
dorit, whose patrol sector was at 
the opposite end of the boundary, 
almost, from the Krell-Glin line 
and who, therefore, must have 
missed the fun of somehow 
involving Salla in the shooting. A 
sea monster, golden-scaled and 
sinuous, more than ten times the 
length of a man’s body,' had been 
sighted in the Gulf of Sumar by a 
party of Mannerangi fishermen, 
who had sworn a mighty oath in 
the Stone Chapel as to the 
authenticity of their vision. The 
prime septa rch of Threish, a 
bloody old brigand if the tales they 
tell of him are true, had abdicated 
and was dwelling in a godhouse in 
the western mountains not far 
from Stroin Gap, serving as a 
drainer for pilgrims bound to Man- 
neran. Such was the news. I found 
no mention of myself. Perhaps 
Stirron had lost interest in having 
me seized and returned to Salla. 

It might therefore be safe for me 
to try to leave Glin. 

Eager as I was to get out of that 
frosty province, where my own kin 
rebuffed me and only strangers 
showed me love, two things held 
me back. For one, I meant to stay 



with Stumwil until 1 could help 
him with his spring planting, in re- 
turn for his kindness to me. For 
another, I would not set forth un- 
drained on so dangerous a journey, 
lest in some mishap my spirit go to 
the gods still full of poisons. This 
village of Klaek had no drainer of 
its own, but depended for its 
solace on itinerant drainers who 
passed now and then through the 
countryside. In the winter these 
wanderers rarely came by and 1 
had gone undrained since the late 
summer, when a member of that 
profession had visited the logging 
camp. 

I fell the need. 



A FATE-WINTER snow came, 
a storm of wonders that coated 
every branch with a fiery skin of 
ice and immediately thereafter 
came a thaw. The world melted. 
Klaek was surrounded by oceans 
of mud. A drainer driving a bat- 
tered and ancient groundcar came 
to us through this slippery sea and 
set up shop in an old shack, doing 
fine business among the villagers. 

1 went to him on the fifth day of 
his visit and unburdened myself for 
two hours, sparing him nothing, 
neither the truth about my identity 
nor my subversive new philosophy 
of kingship nor the usual grimy 
little repressed lusts and prides. It 
was more of a dose, evidently, 
than a country drainer expected to 
receive and he seemed to puff and 



60 



GALAXY 




swell as 1 poured out my words; at 
the end he was shaking as much as 
I and could barely speak. I won- 
dered where it was that drainers 
went to unload all the sins and 
sorrows they absorbed from their 
clients. They are forbidden to talk 
to ordinary men of anything they 
have learned in the confessional; 
did they therefore have drainer- 
drainers, servants of the servants, 
to whom they might deliver that 
which they could not mention to 
anyone else? 1 did not see how a 
drainer, unaided, could long carry 
such bundles of sadnesses as he 
got from any dozen of his custo- 
mers in a day’s listening. 

With my soul cleansed, I had 
only to wait for planting time, and 
it was not long in coming. The 
growing season in Glin is short; 
they get their seeds into the 
ground before winter’s grip has 
fully slipped, so that they can catch 
every ray of spring sunlight. Stum- 
wil waited until he felt certain 
that the thaw would not be 
followed by one last tumult of snow 
and then, with the land still a 
sucking quagmire, he and his 
family went out into the fields to 
plant breadseed and spiceflower 
and blueglobe. 

The custom was to go naked to 
the planting. On the first morning 
I looked out of Stumwil’s cottage 
and beheld the neighbors on all 
sides walking bare toward the 
furrows, children and parents and 
grandparents stripped to the skin 



with sacks of seed slung over their 
shoulders — a procession of knob- 
by knees, sagging bellies, dried-out 
breasts, wrinkled buttocks, illumi- 
nated here and there by the smooth 
firm bodies of the young. Think- 
ing I was in some waking dream, I 
looked around and saw Stumwil 
and his wife and their daughter 
already disrobed and beckoning 
to me to do the same. They took 
their sacks and left the cottage. 
The two young sons scampered 
after them, leaving me with the 
bondsister of Stumwil’s daughter, 
who had overslept and had just 
appeared. She shucked her gar- 
ments too; a supple saucy body 
she had, with small high dark-nip- 
pled breasts and slender well-mus- 
cled thighs. 

I asked her, “Why is the planting 
done naked in such a cold time?” 

“The mud gives cause for 
slipping,’’ she explained, “and it is 
easier to wash raw skin than gar- 
ments.” 

There was truth enough in that, 
for the planting was a comic show, 
with peasants skidding in the 
tricky muck every tenth step they 
took. Down they went, landing on 
hip or haunch and coming up 
smeared with brown; it was a mat- 
ter of skill to grasp the neck of 
one’s seed-sack as one toppled, so 
that no precious seeds would be 
scattered. I fell like the rest, learn- 
ing the knack of it quickly, and in- 
deed there was pleasure in slip- 
ping, for the mud had a voluptuous 



A TIME OF CHANGES 



61 




oozy feel to it. So we marched on, 
staggering and lurching, slapping 
flesh to mud again and again, 
laughing, singing, pressing our 
seeds into the cold soft soil, and not 
one of us but was covered from 
scalp to tail with muck within min- 
utes. I shivered miserably at the 
outset, but soon I was warmed by 
laughter and tripping, and when 
the day's work was done we stood 
around shamelessly naked in front 
of Stumwil’s cottage and doused 
one another with buckets of water 
to clean ourselves. By then it 
seemed reasonable to me that they 
should prefer to expose their skins 
rather than their clothing to such a 
day’s labor, but in fact the girl’s 
explanation was incorrect: 1 

learned from Stumwil later that 
week that the nakedness was a 
religious matter, a sign of humility 
before the gods of the crops and 
nothing else. 

Eight days it took to finish the 
planting. On the ninth, wishing 
Stumwil and his people a hearty 
harvest, I took my leave of the vil- 
lage of Klaek and began my 
journey to the coast. 



NEIGHBOR of Stumwil’s 
took me eastward the first day 
in his cart. 1 walked most of the 
second, begged a ride on the third 
and fourth and walked again on the 
fifth and sixth. The air was cool but 
the crackle of spring was in it, as 
buds unfolded and birds returned. 



I bypassed the city of Glain, which 
might have been dangerous for me, 
and without any events that I can 
clearly recall 1 made my way 
swiftly to Biumar, Glin’s main sea- 
port and second most populous 
city. 

It was a handsomer place than 
Glain, though hardly beautiful: a 
greasy gray sprawl of an oversized 
town, backed up against a gray and 
menacing ocean. On my first day 
there I learned that all passenger 
service between Glin and the 
southern provinces had been 
suspended three moontimes be- 
fore, owing to the dangerous 
activities of pirates operating out 
of Krell, for Glin and Krell were 
now engaged in an undeclared 
war. The only way I could reach 
Manneran, it seemed, was over- 
land via Salla, and I hardly wished 
to do that. I was resourceful, 
though. 1 found myself a room in a 
tavern near the docks and spent a 
few days picking up maritime 
gossip. Passenger service might be 
suspended, but commercial sea- 
faring, I discovered, was not, since 
the prosperity of Glin depended 
upon it; convoys of merchant 
vessels, heavily armed, went forth 
on regular schedules. A limping 
seaman who stayed in the same 
tavern told me, when blue wine of 
Salla had oiled him sufficiently, 
that a merchant convoy of this 
sort would leave in a week's time 
and that he had a berth aboard one 
of the ships. I considered drugging

him on the eve of sailing and 
borrowing his identity, as is done 
in pirate tales for children, but a 
less dramatic method suggested it- 
self to me: I bought his shipping- 
papers. The sum I offered him was 
more than he would have earned by 
shipping out to Manneran and 
back, so he was happy to take my 



money and let me go in his place. 
We spent a long drunken night 
conferring about his duties on the 
ship, for I knew nothing of sea- 
manship. At the coming of dawn 1 
still knew nothing, but I saw ways 
1 could bluff a minimal sort of 
competence. 

1 went unchallenged on board

the vessel, a low-slung air-powered 
craft heavily laden with Glinish 
goods. The checking of papers 
was perfunctory. 1 picked up my 
cabin assignment, installed my- 
self, reported for duty. About half 
the jobs they asked me to do over 
the first few days 1 managed to 
carry out reasonably well by imi- 
tation and experiment; the other 
things I merely muddled with and 
soon my fellow sailors recognized 
me for a bungler, but they kept 
knowledge of that from the 
officers. A kind of loyalty pre- 
vailed in the lower ranks. They did 
for me the jobs I could not do my- 
self; 1 relieved them of dull work 
that was within my narrow skills 
and all went well. I swabbed decks, 
cleaned filters and spent endless 
hours manning the guns against 
pirate attacks. But we got past 
Krell’s dreaded pirate coast with- 
out incident and slipped easily 
down the coast of Salla, which al- 
ready was green with spring. 

Our first port of call was Cofa- 
lon, Salla’s chief seaport, for five 
days of selling and buying. I was 
alarmed at this, for 1 had not 
known we planned to halt any- 
where in my homeland. I thought 
at first to announce myself ill and 
hide belowdecks all our lime in 
Cofalon; but then I rejected the 
scheme as cowardly, telling myself 
that a man must test himself 
"frequently against risk, if he would 
keep his manhood. So I boldly 
went wenching and wining in town 



with my shipmates, trusting that 
time had sufficiently changed my 
face, and that no one would expect 
to find Lord Stirron’s missing 
brother in a sailor’s rough clothes 
in such a town as this. My gamble 
succeeded: 1 went unvexed the full 
five days. From newspapers and 
careful overhearing I learned all 1 
could about events in Salla in the 
year and a half since my leaving. 

Stirron, 1 gathered, was popu- 
larly held to be a good ruler. He 
had brought the province through 
its winter of famine by purchasing 
surplus food from Manneran on 
favorable terms and our farms had 
since then had better fortune. 
Taxes had been cut. The people 
were content. Stirron’s wife had 
been delivered of a son, the Lord 
Dariv, who now was heir to the 
prime septarchy, and another son 
was on the way. As for the Lord 
Kinnall, brother to the septarch, 
nothing was said of him; he was 
forgotten as though he had never 
been. 

We made other stops here and 
there down the coast, several in 
southern Salla, several in northern 
Manneran. And in good time we 
came to that great seaport at the 
southeastern corner of our conti- 
nent, the holy city of Manneran, 
capital of the province that bears 
the same name. It was in Man- 
neran that my life would begin 
anew.

P EGASUS Two. Mercury, Gem- 
ini, Apollo — and Pegasus. Ro- 
bert Goddard, Werner von Braun, 
V-2s over the Channel, Vikings, 
empty capsules, a couple of rhesus 
monkeys, a pair of beguiling 
chimps named Ham and Enos, 
Alan Shepard, John Glenn. Off we 
go into the wild blue yonder. 

And for what? Oust, soil, 
rocks— like that. If the rocks are 
glassy, crystals look out at you say- 
ing, Aren’t we pretty— and more 
than slightly intriguing ? 

Setting up instruments here and 
there. 

Here comes the first nonastro- 
naut to be set loose upon this sun- 
struck mess and I’ve been thinking 
about it too much. 

Pegasus. Hippocrene, I say to 
myself, may have welled forth at 
the touch of your misbegotten 
hoof, but for me, winged steed, you 
are the earth end of a horse headed 
moonward. I’m stumbling around 
Leontievski looking for interesting 
rocks. 

And this, believe me, is where 
the action isn’t. 

Where have all the astros gone? 
Why am I, a mere passenger, rock- 
hounding on the moon — the way I 
used to when I was a pebblepup 
out in the Sierra Madre, except we 
didn’t need space suits there and 
didn’t have to crap into blue bags? 
Well, I’ll tell you: the astronauts, 
most of them, are getting ready for 
Venus and Mars. The moon is a 
backwater, left behind like Dodge 



City when the frontier went that 
away. 

Pegasus, you will understand, is 
a mop-up mission, like cleaning up 
the theater the morning after the 
show folds. No — don’t take me 
wrong — we haven’t solved all the 
moon problems, not by a long 
shot, but there’s not enough money 
(goes without saying), and NASA 
is heading most of what there is 
toward the nearer planets. 

Anyway, who needs those years 
and years of astro training to walk 
around the moon in a space suit, 
latching onto rocks, setting up 
instruments? I am, after all, a cer- 
tified card-carrying geologist^a 
real one, I mean, which is more 
than I can say (with all due respect) 
for the astronauts. Of course we 
have two certified astros on 
Pegasus Two, but I’m here also, 
and that leaves one of them free to 
sit down there on the Florida 
beach, or wherever, and look up at 
the red planet. 

“Hey, Stu,” comes into my 
helmet. Stuart Stong am I, and I’m 
feeling I’m a long way from home 
and I want to go back. I raise my 
enclosed cephalad end and find 
Harry Littlewood outlined on the 
edge of this, our crater. Leon- 
tievski. Wurzelbauer is vaguely to 
the north, and Wilhelm to the 
south. We’re in between. That 
much I do know. 

“Yes?” I say, with stupefying 
originality. 

“You’d better come over here.” 



66 



GALAXY 




Something communicated in the 
voice, something not sounding 
astrocool. I put my rock bag down 
near the LEM and point myself 
toward Harry. 1 approach him and 
lie aims his gloved index finger at 
the gray soil upon which we stand. 

Tracks there, corrugated boot 
prints— almost like ours, but not 
quite. “Tracks,” 1 said. My day for 
coining new phrase. “Must be the 
Russians.” 

“Probably," Harry said. The 
frequency spectrum of our com- 
munications gear wasn’t exactly 
hi-fi, but 1 got the distaste in his 
voice. “None of our missions have 
been anywhere near here." 



T HE tracks approached the edge 
of Leontievski, then went back 
and away, lost in the distance. No 
alien LEM was in sight — but the 
terrain was rough, so that didn't 
mean much one way or the other. 

Consider these: Item one — ap- 
proximately thirty-six hours before 
our lift-off, high-resolution infra- 
red sensors aboard one of our con- 
veniently placed surveillance satel- 
lites had told us the Russians were 
fooling around with something cry- 
ogenic at a known launch site. 
Fuel into booster, right? Right. 
Item two — approximately twenty- 
eight hours before lift-off of Peg- 
asus Two and my own introduc- 
tion to the hazards and boredom 
of space flight, Houston radar had 
picked up a capsule — nothing to 



do with anything of ours — on 
lunar trajectory. This had been 
confirmed, routinely, by Jodrell 
Bank. So — two missions had 
slipped through the same window. 
There had been some talk about 
the possibility of collision in lunar 
orbit, which hadn't cheered me im- 
mensely, though I know — had been 
told, rather — that the probability 
of that occurrence approached 
zero. 

“Well, Robinson,” I said, “let’s 
go see what Friday looks like.” 

The sun was in the right place 
relative to how we stood and I had 
a good look at Harry's eyes. 
Through the two fishbowls some- 
thing that looked like pity came my 
way. Well — Harry was an astro- 
naut, and I was a geologist. 

“Pigeon to Glaucous, how 
copy?” he said. There had been 
some talk of naming our command 
module Edsel, but someone had 
raised questions of taste. 

“Glaucous to Pigeon, loud and 
clear,” said Sid Norris. “I don’t 
know what you boys looking at 
down there, but I’ve cut in 
Houston.” 

“Roger.” Harry was all busi- 
ness, running the store like an 
astronaut should. “Houston?” 
“Roger, Harry.” 

“We’re on the northeastern edge 
of Leontievski,” Harry said while 
I just stood there. “There are foot- 
prints. They come to the crater’s 
edge from the northeast, then go 
back in the same direction they 



PEGASUS TWO 



67 




came from. Could be that Russian 
shot. Anything new on that?" 

“Their hardware is in lunar 
orbit. No danger of collision with 
ours, by the way." Thai's good, I 
thought. “If they did put down a 
LEM- nothing's been heard from 
it. Moscow isn't talking. One set 
of tracks there?” 

“Affirm. One round trip, that 
is." 

“Roger. Stay there," Houston 
said. “We’ll check a bit. Hold there 
for now, acknowledge?” 

“Roger." 

“Houston out." 

“Same size as ours?" Sid asked, 
from lonesome orbit. “Or more 
like an abominable lunar snow 
man?" 

"Little smaller," Harry said. 
“Different tread.” 

“Damn, boy, and howdy. Could 
have been left there a thousand 
years ago, couldn’t they, Harry?" 

“Of course," Harry said. “But 
all probability points at that 
mission that got off the day before 
we did." 

“Well," Sid said, “y 'all be care- 
ful down there, heah? Don't think I 
could hardly fly this thing back 
home all by my lonely lovable old 
self." 

“Never fear while Pigeon's 
here,” I said, but it didn't seem to 
strike the right note. Harry and I 
walked around a little, not messing 
up the prints. 

“Back here, damn it," Harry 
said to me suddenly. I’d wandered 



a few yards along the double row of 
prints. "You heard Houston.” 

"Sorry, Chief. 1 just want to see 
what’s at the end of those tracks. A 
natural-born explorer I. Some- 
body out there might need help," 1 
said. 

“That would be their problem, 
wouldn’t it?" Harry said, and then 
Houston was back on, rattling our 
helmets. “Cool it," Harry said un- 
necessarily. 

“Pigeon from Houston.” 

“Roger, Houston. Loud and 
clear." 

“Roger. Scramble this, Sid." 
The scrambler was new with tired 
old Pegasus. Collins had come up 
with a fancy new bucket of bolts, 
guaranteed to defy unscrambling 
by you know who; ours was the 
first mission to use it. 

"Ready go," Sid said. 

“Acknowledge. Harry and Stu, 
how copy?” 

“Beautiful," Harry said. 1 was 
glad Houston had included me. 

“Well. All right. You boys have 
just put Houston up the wall. 1 
don’t suppose I have to ask if 
you're sure about what you’re 
seeing?" 



W E BOTH looked, involuntar- 
ily, at the tracks again. 
“Please," Harry said. 

“Excuse me. Moscow has been 
talking a little, apparently, but 
saying nothing. Evasive gobble- 
degook. We think their LEM is 



68 



GALAXY 




down, and had a bum trip. Con- 
sensus is as follows: if Stu isn’t too 
tired — you’ve been out a bit, we 
know — Stu follows the tracks and 
you hold down the LEM. How 
does that grab you, Stu?” 

A question of relative expend- 
ability was involved here, 1 
thought, but it suited me fine and 1 
said so. 

“All right. We’ll play it by ear, 
since we have no idea what you'll 
find.” 

“The sooner the better,” says the 
first, and expendable, nonastro 
up here. 1 was looking at home at 
the moment. Color and clouds — 
and I remembered a time I had 
looked for shells on the beaches of 
the Dry Tortugas. 

“Roger. You’re off and running, 
then, Stu. Watch your oxygen - 
turn back soon enough. You’re 
about fifteen minutes from Pi- 
geon, right?” 

“Roger.” 

“Roger. We don’t know how far 
those tracks go. If you’re not at the 
end of the line when oxygen reads 
four five, return to Pigeon. 
Acknowledge?” 

“Charlie Brown. I’m on my 
way.” 

“Roger, Stu. Don't for- 
get — keep talking.” 

And keep listening, I heard in 
the reaches of my mind. We had 
leeway up here and made lots of on 
the spot decisions — that was par 
for the course and expected. But 
when the chips were really down 



Houston called the shots and I 
understood that. 

“Harry?” Houston again. 
“Roger.” 

“Back to Pigeon. Mind the 
store. We don't want any monkey 
business up there.” 

“That’s a roger. On my way.” 
“Roger. Houston out." 

Harry wanted to go, I could tell, 
but there was no way. He was, after 
all, worth more to NASA than I 
was. Besides, he knew how to fly 
the LEM. 

“Stu?” Sid, from orbit. 

“Bet you wish you were down 
here, Sid. But we can’t all grab the 
brass ring, can we?” 

“You watch it, heah?” 

“I gone go catch me a man 
Friday,” I said. 



T HE tracks looked very fresh — 
like mine. But for all 1 knew 
about micrometeoric erosion of 
moon surface those prints could 
have been made twenty thousand 
years ago. I plodded along the trail, 
talking just enough to keep Control 
and Harry and Sid happy. The 
outer slope of the crater rim was 
steeper than it had seemed from 
above. I almost tumbled once and 
the tracks told me that whoever 
had been there before me had done 
the same. I felt a sense of kinship, 
or something, but said nothing 
about it. 

At the base of the rim the soil 
became hard, the tracks difficult 



PEGASUS TWO 



69 




to follow. The terrain was- well, 
frightening. Back in Pigeon I had 
looked home and wished I were 
there. In this wilderness I thought 
of Pigeon, which I could no longer 
see, and just about wished myself 
therein which ends today’s lesson in 
relativity. 

I described the situation as I 
went along. “It's rough," I said. 
“The footing, I mean. Reminds me 
of when I was 

"Where are you, Stu, exactly.’" 
Houston, 

“Just at the bottom of the crater 
rim. There’s a ridge ahead. The 
tracks point thataway. No LEM, 
no astronaut waving a red Hag, no 
monsters. Sound footing. I’ll keep 
following." 

“Roger,” Houston said. “Let us 
know- ” 

“All right," I said. What did 
they take me for? I knew what they 
took me for. 

“Cool it," Harry said. I didn't 
respond for a few minutes, crunch- 
ing along through the gray soil. I 
passed through a stretch where my 
prints were, I judged, about an inch 
and a half deep. The tracks I fol- 
lowed seemed a bit shallower but I 
didn’t stop to measure. 

“I’m at the foot of the ridge," I 
said, continuing the travelogue. 
“The tracks go right on up. And so 
go I. Come with me,” 1 said to my 
unseen auditors, “as we ascend 
Stong’s Ridge." 

“For Christ's sake," someone 
said — voice low, but I heard it. I 



was quiet after that until they 
asked about progress. 

“I'm halfway up the ridge," I 
said. “I’m four-fifths up. Three 
more steps and I'll be--’’ A 
moment of silence and I stretched 
it a little. “I got me a LEM," I 
said. 

They all sputtered at once and it 
was something to listen to. I held 
off long enough for the despera- 
tion quotient to build up to a satis- 
factory level, then relented. 

I requested silence. 

A craft of strange design, I told 
them, had indeed had a bum trip. 
No, I’d never seen anything like it. 
It doesn’t look twenty thousand 
years old from outer space, I said. 
More like contemporary, but dif- 
ferent. It had three legs, or pods, 
same as ours, and one of them had, 
from what I could see at that dis- 
tance, come down smack on a 
boulder. The unit was on its side, 
like a cat sleeping, or a drunk 
thrown into the street. More chat- 
ter came through the scrambler 
than you can imagine. Finally 
Houston said that was fine, now be 
a good boy and go back to Pigeon 
while we evaluate. I see , I said to 
myself. They will evaluate it better 
down there than I will up here, my 
boots standing in moondust. Screw 
it .. 

"Not right now," I said and a 
mighty cool voice came back to me 
from Houston; I recognized it, but 
I’d never talked to it. After he'd 
said his piece, I said mine. “I got 



70 



GALAXY 




me an astronaut, too,” I said and 
Ricked off the incoming audio. 

«yOU can hear me,” I said, 

*“but I can't hear you, so you 
might as well all hush.” I began to 
walk toward the suited figure that 
had emerged from the fallen LEM. 
It stood there waiting and I 
pictured the scene at Houston. As I 
approached 1 made out a hammer 
and sickle on the near side of the 
spacecraft. Shucks, it's not from 
way out there . 

“It’s a Russian LEM,” I said. 
“Doesn't look like it’ll Hy again. 
Astronaut standing there. I’m 
going forward.” 

When 1 was close enough to see 
inside the other fishbowl I was 
glad that LEM wasn’t from way 
out there, because what was inside 
that spacesuit was a girl, by damn, 
and inside the fishbowl was one of 
the loveliest heads I’d ever seen. 
She looked scared, though, lots of 
white showing around irises of 
undetermined, but dark color. 
What the protocol? A tired joke 
about Mrs. Livingstone? 

We stood there looking at each 
other. I thought again of the scene 
at Houston and — not to my 
credit — I smiled. 1 turned off my 
mike, and we both started talking 
at the same time, hearing only our 
own voices, of course. 

Then, wondering if I were being 
presumptuous or too familiar — I 
had no precedent to guide me — I 



touched my bowl against hers and 
said, “Hello?” 

Improbably, then, the smell of 
balsam was inside my helmet; I 
wondered why, until I remembered 
the wounded fawn I'd taken care 
of one fall in New Hampshire. The 
fawn had been left behind, on our 
property, by a careless jacking 
hunter. I hated hunters, then and 
now. 

“Hello,” she said tentatively. So 
far so good. She spoke English, at 
least one word of it, which was 
more than could be said for me and 
Russian. 

“It's all right,” I said, not know- 
ing what I was talking about. “You 
speak English well?” 

She looked at me and consid- 
ered. It was almost cozy, standing 
there in the moondust. The first 
girl I'd seen in a long time, and 
our heads, so to speak, together. 
What the hell, it was the only way 
we could talk. 

“Enough well, I think," she said. 

“We have much to talk about,” I 
said and she nodded. I indicated 
for her to stand by a minute and 
turned on both mike and receiver. 
“Houston?” I waited for the noise 
to taper off. Harry was calling, Sid 
was calling and it was hard to say 
how many mikes were open in 
Houston in violation of all SOP. It 
reminded me of amateur radio pile- 
ups on rare stations when I had 
been a callow youth, working on 
DXCC. It did quiet, though. “Put 
Sam on, please, if he's there.” Sam 



PEGASUS TWO 



71 




was one of the communicators I 
liked. I knew he was there, all 
right; so was everyone else on that 
side of the Mississippi, everyone 
who had anything to do with 
Pegasus Two. 

“This is Sam, Stu. Copy?” 

“Roger, Sam. Glad you’re there. 
May I say — “ 

“May 1 say," Sam interrupted 
me, “that the whole world is listen- 
ing, the whole world that can get 
through this scrambler, that is, 
and there's quite a bunch here. 
Would it be asking too much—” 

“Cool it,” 1 said. I'd been told 
that quite a number of limes lately; 
1 didn’t mind turning it the other 
way round. 1 knew a hundred reels 
of tape were recording every 
intonation for NASA and poster- 
ity. I waited until everything was 
quiet again. “Sam?” 

“Yes.” 

“That’s better. Knowing the 
impatience rampant down there. 
I've called you as soon as it seemed 
meaningful to do so.” I paused. 
Not a word. Like, man, 1 had my 
audience. “This is going to be a 
short transmission and when I've 
finished I'll terminate contact 
again. Temporarily, of course.” 
There wasn’t much flak this 
time- my helmet was quiet in 
about twenty seconds. “I'm 
standing next to a Soviet LEM. 
One pod hit a boulder. This bird 
won’t fly no more, I think. I'm also 
standing next to a Russian astro- 
naut. Make that astronette; she’s a 



girl. She speaks English.” I waited 
for that to register. While it was 
doing so I noted that she had put 
her fishbowl back against mine. 
There was a strange intimacy in 
that. How much of what I was 
saying she was getting I didn't 
know. I smiled at her and she gave 
me something back, a kind of 
smile, scared still but saying some- 
thing I’d have to decode later. 
Suddenly I had to know her name. 
I cut the rig and asked her. 

She sobered. 

“Nora,” she said. 

“That's nice. I'm Stu.” I said, 
we standing there in the wilder- 
ness. Through our masses of 
coverings I touched her elbow, then 
turned the communications back 
on. 

“I just got here,” I said, “and I 
know nothing more than I've told 
you. I have plenty of oxygen.” I 
checked. “Reads now— five one. 
I'll be back to you as soon as I have 
anything further.” Decibels came 
pouring into my helmet like a 
million starlings under a bridge at 
twilight. It was the easiest thing in 
the world to turn them off and that 
was what I did. Power lends to 
corrupt. I’m not maintaining that, 
just quoting. 

“You understood?” I asked 
Nora, my communicative transis- 
tors all dismasted. 

“Some.” 

“We must talk.” 

“Yes. We can go in,” she said, 
nodding toward the open hatch. 



72 



GALAXY 




A ND change into something 
more comfortable, 1 thought 
wildly. Talk through air instead of 
plastic, that would be good. The 
hatch faced us. I found I was gently 
urging her toward it. 

“First this,” she said and this 
time she took my elbow. Trusting 
soul that I’ve always been, I fol- 
lowed her. She led me to the other 
side of the LEM, down into a 
shallow gully. I got me another 
astronaut, I thought, but this one's 
dead. “He died when we opened 
the-— door,” Nora said. “The 
landing was — bad. There was a 
tear in the suit- we didn't know. 
We couldn't close the door fast 
enough." 

I got the picture. 

“All right." 

We went back to the lying-down 
hatch and climbed inside the LEM. 
I helped her close the hatch, which 
was difficult because we had to 
close it upward instead of sideways. 
Nora manipulated switches, some- 
what hesitantly, and watched indi- 
cators. She nodded and began to 
unsuit. Everything was on its side 
because of the bum landing, but it 
didn't seem to make much differ- 
ence. Try this: turn your favorite 
room to any angle, granting the 
furniture is fixed and not free- 
floating. Give it a little bit of 
gravity and imagine you're on that 
old deserted island. By deserted 
island I mean you're snug there, 
without external disturbance or 
distraction. It would work, right? 



I unsuiled, too. 

“This is better," I said. It was 
better by orders of magnitude. 

“Yes," she said and rummaged 
into an upsidedown locker. I had a 
delightful vision of the hushed and 
silent scene (I imagined) at Mission 
Control. Nora's next words did 
nothing to detract from that. 
“Vodka," she said, “yes?" 

The Russians do this better than 
we, I thought. I was tempted to call 
up Harry, whose altitude toward 
the Soviet program had always 
been tinged with a moderate, but 
unappealing, paranoid aura. 

“Yes," I said. 

"This is for emergency only, of 
course," she said haltingly, but not 
missing a word. I was again glad 
she spoke English. I could have 
managed no communication in 
Russian. 

“This is an emergency," I said. 
First she smiled, then she laughed, 
really laughed and so did I, not 
pausing to inquire into the justifi- 
cation or rationale for euphoria 
under these circumstances. She 
handed me a squeeze bottle, took 
one herself and we touched them 
together. My goodness. I wasn't 
about to turn in my stars and 
stripes for the hammer and sickle, 
but that vodka was something else. 
We didn't need squeeze bottles in 
lunar gravity, but that was their 
issue and I wasn’t about to com- 
plain. 

We had to get down to business 
sooner or later and I thought to get

il over. "How fong will it go?" I 
asked, indicating with a sweep of 
my hand the fallen LEM. “The life 
support system, the oxygen?" 

"Three or four days, I think. 
That part I don't think is- hurt." 

No way to get the LEM back 
into proper position. I knew Harry 
and I couldn't right it. Something 
for future missions to think 
about- -hydraulic lifts or some- 
thing. No engineer I. 

“I could not fly it anyway," she 
said. “And the radio is gone in 
the landing.” 

No doubt about it, we were on 
the first rescue mission in space. I 
wondered how Harry would like 
that; he didn't want to be in the 
same world with the Russians, let 
alone the same spacecraft. 

“Even if the craft were all right, 
you couldn't fly it?” 

“No. I came as scientist. 
Geologist.” 

“That makes two of us," I said. 
"I'll have to call Houston. 1 
wonder if I can do it without 
suiting up.” I didn’t want to go out- 
side. I got as close as I could to one 
of the ports, hoping my milliwatt 
signal would radiate. I came on all 
formal. “Houston,” I said. 
“Pigeon here. How copy ?” 



S AM was still on. “You're weak, 
Stu, but I read you. Where — ” 
"Roger. I’m in the capsized 
LEM with Nora. That's her 
name," I said, realizing again this 



was my day for coining deathless 
phrase. "The captain of the mis- 
sion is dead, busted his suit in land- 
ing and didn't know it when they 
cracked the hatch. Life support is 
in go condition, presumably 
undamaged. Radio was knocked 
out in landing. Roger?" 

“Acknowledge. But let me say 
something when you're through." 

A touch of the velvet glove, yes. 
“Affirmative. So we have to get 
the girl down. I suggest you get on 
the hot line to Moscow and 
“Hold it—” 

Now the iron hand within the 
glove, Sam interrupting me with 
such force 1 just sat there and lis- 
tened. “Stu. The decision to open 
the hot line isn’t made in Houston, 
it's made in the White House. 
However, for your information, 
the hot line is open. We’ve told the 
Russians you've found their LEM, 
and that it’s apparently knocked 
out. Now we’ll confirm that and 
let them know one of their astro- 
nauts is dead — the captain. 
Decisions will be made in high 
places before this day is over, Stu. 
Anything else now?" 

"I don't know what decisions 
have to be made. We bring Nora 
back with us, of course 

Harry broke in. “We don’t have 
the thrust for that, Stu, and you 
know it." 

“So we dump the rocks, for 
Pete’s sake. No problem—” 

Sam broke in with authority. 
“All right, gentlemen, knock it 



74 



GALAXY 




off. Decisions will be made in the 
White House and I don't think 
either of you should try to out- 
guess the President. Maintain 
status quo for now. We'll be back 
to you when we have something. 
Houston out.” 

“Just one, Sam." Sid. 

“Make it short." 

“Roger. I say we take her back, 
that's all. Have to.” 

“Okay, Sid, your vote's in — but 
it's academic. None of you has a 
vote and the decision will be made 
by the President. Houston out." 

“Harry?” I called. 

“Roger.” 

“You're out of your cotton-pick- 
ing mind, chum. We’ve got no 
problem. We take Nora instead of 
the rocks “ 

“Do you know how much it costs 
per pound, per ounce, to come up 
here and take those rocks back?" 

I reached out my hand and Nora 
put another squeeze bottle in it. 
Good girl. “I certainly do, Harry. 
But for heaven's sake, man, think 
of the political value of rescuing a 
Russian lost in space. Anyway, 
how could you, or anyone, trade 
the whole damn moon, let alone a 
few rocks, for one pretty girl’s life? 
She is pretty -” 

“Like Sam said, Stu, the deci- 
sion is the President’s." 

“Right. But you know perfectly 
well what that decision will be, has 
to be. You know. Besides — if the 
Prexy had a moment of aberration 
and made the wrong decision, we 



could make the right one lor him 
right here. No way they could stop 
us.” 

“That sounds pretty much like 
treason, Stu." 

“I'm with Stu,” came from lone- 
some Sid. 

“Thanks, pal. I know you, 
though, you just want to see a 
pretty girl again.” 

"Pigeon from Houston." 

“Roger," Harry and I said at the 
same time. 

“Nothing new yet, lots going on. 
Just wanted to remind you, in view 
of your conversation, you're being 
monitored, taped, stored and 
otherwise pul on record. Houston 
out." 

1 llicked off the radio. I wasn't 
going to crouch down there by the 
port waiting for Houston to come 
back; we were in the driver's seat, 
as they must have known. I looked 
at Nora. 

“I’m a problem," she said. 

“To them- perhaps. Not really. 
To Harry yes. He has some weird 
ideas. To me- -no problem." 

The smell of balsam in the LEM 
now. Lunar propinquity, the ab- 
sence of spacesuits, the furor down 
there, we quiet where we were 
this created, we discovered, an 
equation to be dealt with. And — 
without unseemly haste, but not 
wasting time— we dealt with it. 

Spacecraft were not built for it, 
but (may I say) it worked. It did 
do. 

Another lunar first, all right? 



PEGASUS TWO 



75 





W HEN we had made it a lunar 
second I fired up the rig and 
got on with Houston. 

“We've been waiting," Sam 
said. 1 had read about glacial tones, 
but that was the first time I really 
heard one. 

“I had to — rest,” I said. 1 tried, 
possibly without success, to make 
my voice, my self, sound tired. 
"You’re refreshed now?” 

“Yes, sir,” I said, going along. 
"That's good. Now hear this. 
The Russians have no capability of 
putting up a rescue mission, nor 
do we. The President has decided 
to scrap the sample-collecting 
aspect of Pegasus Two. The rescue 
is on.” Of course, I thought. "Sid 
and Harry know about 
this— they've had their radios on." 
I got that. “Sid agrees and Harry 
doesn’t but that's neither here 
nor there. Copy all right, Stu?” 
“Loud and clear." 

"All right, here’s the way it goes. 



77 



You’ve had a little rest but not 
enough." Nora and I smiled at 
each other. “And the President 
says we’re not to leave Nora alone 
on the surface of the moon for a 
moment. Therefore, you and she 
will rest— sleep if you can -in the 
Russian LEM for the next six 
hours, then proceed to Pigeon. 
After that you and Harry will com- 
plete such assignments as possible 
within the following seven and a 
half hours. Then back to Glaucous, 
and home. Acknowledge?" 

“Affirm. Double affirm." 

“Sam?" Harry. 

“Negative. 1 won't do it. Been 
thinking about it. The rocks are all 
aboard. I’m going to bring the 
rocks back." 

“That’s not possible, Harry.” 
There was a tremor in Sam’s voice, 
and stunned disbelief. “You men- 
tioned treason a while back — ” 

“I’ll take the verdict of history 
on that," Harry said, his voice flat, 
cool. 

The shrinks really blew this 
one . 

“Harry," Sam said. “If you do 
this — do you know where you’ll be 
when you get back?" 

“I know. Pigeon out." 

“Wait a minute, Harry — what- 
for Christ’s sake, now? All right. 
I’m going to retire tomorrow. 
Harry, stand by. Stu?” 

“Roger.” 

“Would you believe the Presi- 
dent is on — wants to talk to Nora. 
Get her to the mike, can you?” 



“Roger.” Nora had heard. She 
paled. “The President wants to talk 
to you,” I said unnecessarily. She 
crouched down beside me. “We’re 
ready, Sam.’’ 

“Roger. Just one. Mr. President 
— you’re on, sir.” 

“Thank you,” said the familiar 
voice. “Miss Nora, do you hear 
me?” 

“This is Nora Ivanovna. I hear 
you, sir." 

“Miss Ivanovna. I greet you in 
the name of the people of the 
United States. We profoundly 
regret the failure of your mission 
and the loss of your fellow astro- 
naut and we extend to you and your 
country our heartfelt sym- 
pathies.” Hell. Well, anyway, he 
made the right decision. “We are 
honored, however, Miss Ivanovna, 
to be able to bring you back to 
Earth. This will bring our countries 
together. My wife and I look 
forward to seeing you in the W'hite 
House. God speed home.” 

The President was waiting. 

Nora took her time, thinking. 

“Thank you, Mr. President," 
she finally said. I wished the 
President could have seen us there, 
me holding her hand. “Thank you. 
And, for now, goodbye.” 

“Goodbye, Miss Ivanovna.” 



WANE moment, Mr. President, 
l#sir," we heard Sam say, be- 
fore they cut us out of the circuit. A 
few minutes later: “Pigeon from 



78 



GALAXY 




Houston. Harry, come in.” 
Nothing. Repeat several times, still 
nothing. “Try him, Stu,” Sam said 
and 1 did. Same result. Same with 
Sid. “Hold on,” Sam said. Then: 
“This is the President speaking. 
Mr. Harry Littlewood, do you 
hear me? Mr. Littlewood? I 
repeat, this is the President speak- 
ing. You are hereby ordered to 
participate in the rescue mission 
as planned. Do you acknowledge? 
I repeat, this is a direct order from 
the President. You will participate 
in the rescue as planned. I need not 
point out the consequences of 
refusal to carry out this order.” 

Nothing from Harry. “Thank 
you, Mr. President. We’ll keep 
trying.” 

“Sam?” I called. 

“Yes, Harry.” He did sound 
tired. 

“Stu here. In view of the 
circumstances I think we’d better 
revise the plan. How about Nora 
and I go over now and I try to 
reason with Harry?” 

“Hold one." I could see heads 
nodding all over Mission Control. 
“That’s a roger, Stu. And you’d 
better get going. Keep in contact.” 

“Roger.” We suited up in a 
hurry. “Sid,” I called, when we 
were out and going along the 
tracks. 

“Roger, Stu. For God’s sake, 
talk some sense into Harry, he’s 
flipped.” 

“Yes. Tell me this — if 1 have to 
knock him out or something, and 



bring him up unconscious, could 
you tell me how to fly that thing up 
there?” 

“I doubt it, Stu. No training. It’s 
not all computerized by a long 
shot. But you know that. Possible, 
but not likely. Go.” 

“Roger. Just wondered. We’re 
on our way.” 

Once more unto the rim of 
Leontievski. We put our heads 
together once, resting, and I said to 
Nora this was like walking in a 
spring morning on a street in 
Xenia, Ohio, and she said it was 
like an unnamable place in Lenin- 
grad in mid-May. So much for 
time, space, seasons and geogra- 
phy. 

At the same time, as it 
happened, so much for Harry’s 
LEM. It flamed up as we stood on 
Leontievski’s rim and we watched 
it go. Barring the circumstances it 
would have been beautiful — and 
even, or in spite of, or because of, 
or whatever -it was, indeed, 
beautiful. An awkward stork rising 
from an unknown marsh. 

Well. And up yours, too . 

We watched the ascending 
flame. Left behind. Another lunar 
first. Nora and I put our heads 
together. 

“We have some more days 
together,” Nora said. “Three. 
Maybe four.” 

We smiled through the fish- 
bowls. 

And back, once more, to the 
fallen LEM. ★

I 

O LGAN A -Earth-type, revolv- 
ing around a Sol-type primary 
—is a backwater planet. It is well 
off the main Galactic trade 
routes, although it gets by quite 
comfortably by exporting meat. 



butter, wool and the like to the 
neighboring, highly industrialized 
Mekanika System. Olgana was a 
Lost Colony, one of those worlds 
stumbled upon quite by chance 
during the First Expansion, set- 
tled in a spirit of great thankful- 
ness by the personnel of a hope- 



81 



lessly off course, completely lost 
emigrant lodejammer. It was re- 
discovered — this time with no ele- 
ment of chance involved — by the 
Survey Service's Trail Blazer , be- 
fore the colonists had drifted too 
far from the mainstream of hu- 
man culture. 

Shortly thereafter there were 
legal proceedings against these 
same colonists, occupying a few 
argumentative weeks at the Fed- 
eration’s Court of Galactic Jus- 
tice in Geneva, on Earth; had 
these been successful they would 
have been followed by an eviction 
order. Even in those days it was il- 
legal for humans to establish 
themselves on any planet already 
supporting an intelligent life 
form. But — and the colonists’ 
learned counsel made the most of 
it— that law had not been in ex- 
istence when Lode Jumbuk lifted 
off from Port Woomera on what 
turned out to be her last voyage. It 
was ‘only a legal quibble, but the 
aborigines had no representa- 
tion at Court — and, furthermore, 
the counsel for the defense had 
hinted in the right quarters that if 
he lost this case he would bring suit 
on behalf of his clients against the 
Interstellar Transport Com- 
mission, holding that body fully re- 
sponsible for the plights of Lode 
Jumbuk's castaways and their de- 
scendants. ITC, fearing that a 
dangerous and expensive prece- 
dent might be established, brought 
behind-the-scenes pressure to 



bear and the case was dropped. 
Nobody asked the aborigines 
what they thought about it all. 

There was no denying that the 
Olganan natives — if they were 
natives — were a backward race. 
They were humanoid — to out- 
ward appearances human. They 
did not, however, quite fit into the 
general biological pattern of 
their world, the fauna of which 
mainly comprised very primi- 
tive, egg-laying mammals. The ab- 
origines were mammals as highly 
developed as Man himself, al- 
though along slightly different 
lines. There had been surprisingly 
little research into Olganan biol- 
ogy, however, the colony’s highly 
competent biologists seemed to be 
entirely lacking in the spirit of sci- 
entific curiosity. They were bio- 
logical engineers rather than sci- 
entists, their main concern being 
to improve the strains of their 
meat-producing and wool-bearing 
animals, descended in the main 
from the spermatozoa and ova 
which Lode Jumbuk — as did all 
colonization vessels of her period 
— had carried under refrigeration. 

To Olgana came the Survey 
Service’s Serpent Class Courier 
Adder , Lieutenant John Grimes 
commanding. She carried not- 
very-imporlanl dispatches for 
Commander Lewin, officer in 
charge of the small Federation 
Survey Service Base maintained 
on the planet. 

The dispatches were delivered 



82 



GALAXY 




and then, after the almost manda- 
tory small talk. Grimes asked, 
“And would there be any orders 
for me, Commander?" 

Lewin — a small, dark, usually 
intense man — grinned. “Of a sort. 
Lieutenant. Of a sort. You must 
be in Commodore Damien's good 
books. When I was skipper of a 
Courier it was always a case of 
getting from Point A to Point B as 
soon as possible, if not before, 
with stopovers cut down to the ir- 
reducible minimum . Well, 
since you ask, 1 received a Carlot- 
tigram from Officer Command- 
ing Couriers just before you blew 
in. I am to inform you that there 
will be no employment for your 
vessel for a period of at least six 
weeks, local. You and your officers 
are to put yourselves at my 
disposal." The commander grin- 
ned again. “I find it hard enough to 
find jobs enough to keep my own 
personnel busy. So— enjoy your- 
selves. Go your merry ways re- 
joicing, as long as you carry your 
personal transceivers at all times. 
See the sights, such as they are. 
Wallow in the fleshpots such as 
they are.” He paused. “1 only wish 
that the commodore had loved 
me as much as he seems to love 
you.” 

“Mphm,” grunted Grimes, his 
prominent ears reddening. “I don't 
think that it's quite that way, sir.” 
He was remembering his last 
interview with Damien. 

Get out of my sight, the Com- 



modore had snarled. Get out of 
my sight — and don't come back 
until I'm in a better temper, if 
ever . 

“Indeed?” with a sardonic lift of 
the eyebrows. 

“I don’t think that I’m overly 
popular around Lindisfarne Base 
at the moment.” 

Lewin laughed outright. “I’d 
guessed as much. Your fame, 
Lieutenant, has spread even to 
Olgana. Frankly, I don’t want you 
in my hair, around my base, 
humble though it be. The adminis- 
tration of this planet is none of my 
concern, luckily, so you and your 
officers can carouse to your 
heart’s content as long as you 
don’t do so in my bailiwick.” 

“Have you any suggestions, 
sir?” asked Grimes stiffly. 

“Why, yes. There’s the so-called 
Gold Coast. It got started after 
the trans-galactic clippers started 
calling here on their cruises.” 

“Inflated prices,” grumbled 
Grimes. “A tourist trap.” 

“How right you are. But not 
every TG cruise passenger is a mil- 
lionaire. I could recommend, per- 
haps, the coach tour of Never- 
never. You probably saw it from 
space on your way in — that 
whacking great island continent in 
the Southern Hemisphere." 

“How did it get its name?" 

“The natives cal! it that — or 
something that sounds almost like 
that. It's the only continent upon 
which the aborigines live, by the 



THE MOUNTAIN MOVERS 



83 




way. When Lode Jumbuk made 
her landing there was no intelligent 
life at all in the Northern Hemi- 
sphere.” 

“What's so attractive about this 
tour?” 

"Nevernever is the only un- 
spoiled hunk of real estate on the 
planet. It has been settled along the 
coastal fringe by humans, but the 
Outback- which means the inland 
and most of the country north of 
Capricorn is still the way it was 
when men first came here. Oh, 
there are sheep and cattle stations 
and mining, but there won't be any 
real development, with irrigation 
and all the rest, until population 
pressure forces it. And the abo- 
rigines - well, most of them still 
live in the semidesert, as they did 
before Lode Jumbuk came.” Le- 
win was warming up. “Think of it. 
Lieutenant, an opportunity to ex- 
plore a primitive world while en- 
joying all modern conveniences! 
You might never get such a chance 
again.” 

“I’ll think about it," Grimes told 
him. 

H E THOUGHT about it. He dis- 
cussed it with his officers. Mr. 
Beadle, the first lieutenant, was not 
enthusiastic. In spite of his habitu- 
al lugubrious mien he had a pas- 
sion for the bright' lights and made 
it quite clear that he had enjoyed of 
late so few opportunities to spend 
his pay that he could well afford a 
Gold Coast holiday. Von Tannen- 



baum, navigator, Slovolny, elec- 
tronic communications and Vitel- 
li, engineer, sided with Beadle. 
Grimes did not try to persuade 
them™ after all, he was getting no 
commission from the Olganan 
tourist bureau. Spooky Deane, the 
psionic communications officer, 
asked rather shyly if he could come 
along with the captain. He was not 
the companion Grimes would have 
chosen - but he was a telepath and 
it was just possible that his gift 
would be useful. 

Deane and Grimes took the 
rocket mail from Newer York to 
New Melbourne, and during the 
trip Grimes indulged in one of his 
favorite whinges, about the in- 
ability of the average colonist to 
come up with really original 
names for his cities. At New Mel- 
bourne ^ drab, oversized village 
on the southern coast of Never- 
never -they stayed at a hotel 
which, although recommended by 
trans-galactic clippers, failed 
dismally to come up to galactic 
standards, making no attempt 
whatsoever to cater to guests 
born and brought up on worlds 
with widely differing atmos- 
pheres, gravitational fields and 
dietary customs. Then there was a 
day’s shopping, during which the 
two spacemen purchased such 
items of personal equipment as 
they had been told would be nec- 
essary by the office of Nevernever 
Tours. The following morning, 
early, they took a cab from their 



84 



GALAXY 




hotel to the coach terminal. It 
was still dark. And it was cold. 
And it was raining. 

They sat with the other passen- 
gers —all of whom were, like them- 
selves, roughly dressed — in the 
chilly waiting room, waiting for 
something to happen. To pass the 
time Grimes sized up the others. 
Some were obviously outworlders 
a TG clipper was in at the 
spaceport. Some -their accent 
made it obvious — were Olganans, 
taking the opportunity of seeing 
something of their own planet. 
None of them, on this dismal 
morning, looked very attractive. 
Grimes admitted that the same 
could be said about Deane and 
himself; the telepath conveyed 
the impression of a blob of ecto- 
plasm roughly wrapped in a too- 
gaudy poncho. 

A heavy engine growled outside 
and bright lights stabbed through 
the big windows. Deane rose un- 
steadily to his feet. 

“Look at that, Captain — wheels, 
yet. I expected an inertial drive ve- 
hicle — or at least a hoverbus.” 
“You should have read the bro- 
chure, Spooky. The idea of this 
tour is to see the country the way 
the first explorers did, to get the 
feel of it.” 

“I can get the feel of it as well 
from an aircraft as from that 
archaic contraption.” 

“We aren’t all telepaths.” 

Two porters had come in and 



were picking up suitcases, carry- 
ing them outside. The tourists, 
holding their overnight grips, fol- 
lowed, watched their baggage being 
stowed in a locker at the rear of the 
coach. From the P. A. system a 
voice was ordering, “All passen- 
gers will now embus — all passen- 
gers will now embus — ” 

The passengers obeyed and 
Grimes and Deane found 
themselves seated behind a young 
couple of obviously Terran origin, 
while across the aisle from them 
was a pair of youngish ladies who 
could be nothing other than 
schoolteachers. A fat, middle- 
aged man, dressed in a not very 
neat uniform of gray coveralls, 
eased himself into the driver’s 
seat. 

“All aboard?” he asked. “Any- 
body who’s not, sing out!” The 
coach lurched from the terminus 
on to the rain-wet street, was soon 
bowling north through the dreary 
suburbs of New Melbourne. 



II 

N ORTHEAST they ran at first 
then almost due north, 
following the coast. Here the land 
was rich, green, well-wooded, with 
apple orchards, vineyards, or- 
ange groves. Then came sheep 
country, rolling do wnl and speck- 
led with the white shapes of the 
grazing animals. 



THE MOUNTAIN MOVERS

“It’s wrong,” Deane whispered 
to Grimes. “It's all wrong— " 
“What's wrong, Spooky?" 

“I can feel it even if you can't. 
The — the resentment-^?- ’ 

“The aborigines, you mean?” 
“Yes. But even stronger is that 
of the native animals, driven from 
their own pastures, hunted and de- 
stroyed to make room for the out- 
siders from beyond the stars. And 
the plants — what’s left of the na- 
tive flora in these parts — They’ve 
become weeds to be rooted out 
and burned, so that the grapes and 
grain and the oranges may 
nourish — ” 

“You must have felt the same on 
other colonized worlds. Spooky." 

“Not as strongly as here. I can 
almost put it into words: The First 
Ones let us alone- 

“Mphm,'' grunted Grimes. 
“Makes sense, I suppose. The 
original colonists, with only the 
resources of Lode Jumbuk to draw 
upon, couldn't have made much of 
an impression. But when men had 
all the resources of the Feder- 
ation to draw upon — " 

“I don't think it's quite that 
way,” murmured Deane, 
fully. 

“Then what do you think ?” 

“I — I don’t know, Captain." 
They had little further oppor- 
tunity for private talk. Slowly at 
first, then more rapidly, the coach- 
load of assorted passengers was 
thawing out. The driver initiated 
this process -he was, Grimes 
realized, almost like the captain 



of a ship, responsible for the 
well-being, psychological as well 
as physical, of his charges. Using a 
fixed microphone by his seat he 
delivered commentaries on the 
places of interest that they passed 
and, when he judged that the time 
was ripe, had another micro- 
phone on a wandering lead passed 
among the passengers, the drill 
being that each would introduce 
himself by name, profession and 
place of residence. 

The tourists were a mixed bag. 
About half of them were from 
Earth — they must be, thought 
Grimes, from the TG clipper, 
Cutty Sark , presently berthed at 
the spaceport “public servants, 
lawyers, the inevitable instruc- 
tors from universities, both major 
and minor, improving their 
knowledge of the worlds of the 
Federation in a relatively in- 
expensive way. The Olganans were 
similarly diversified. 

When Grimes' turn came he 
said, “John Grimes, spaceman. 
Last place of permanent resi- 
dence St. Helier, Channel Is- 
lands, Earth." 

Tanya Lancaster, the younger 
and prettier of the two teachers 
across the aisle, turned to him. “I 
thought you were a Terry, John. 
You don't mind my using your 
given name, do you? It's supposed 
to be one of the rules on this tour." 

“I like it, Tanya." 

“That's good. But you can’t be 
from the Cutty Sark. I should 



86 



GALAXY 




know all the officers, at least by 
sight, by this time." 

“And if I were one of Cutty 
Sark's officers," said Grimes gal- 
lantly Tanya was not at all bad 
looking, with her chestnut hair, 
green eyes and thin, intelligent 
face “I should have known you 
by this time." 

"Oh, she said, “you must be 
from the base." 

“Almost right." 

“You are making things 
awkward. Ah, I have it. You're 
from that funny little destroyer 
or whatever it is that's berthed at 
the Survey Service's end of the 
spaceport." 

“She's not a funny little de- 
stroyer," Grimes told her stiffly. 
"She's a Serpent-class courier." 

“And now, folks," boomed the 
driver's amplified voice, “how 
about a little sing-song to liven 
things up? Any volunteers?" 

The microphone was passed 
along to a group of young Olgan- 
an students. After a brief consul- 
tation they burst into song. 

When the jolly Jumbuk lifted 
from Port Woomera 
Out and away for Altair Three 
Glad were we all to kiss the tired 
old Earth goodbye 
Who'll come a-sailing in Jum- 
buk with me? 

Sailing in Jumbuk, sailing in 
Jumbuk, 



Who'll come a-sailing in Jum- 
buk with me? 

Glad were we all to kiss the tired 
old Earth goodbye 
You'll come a-sailing in Jumbuk 
with me! 

Then there was storm, the pile 
and all the engines dead 
Blown out to hell and gone were 
we! 

Lost in the galaxy , falling free in 
sweet damn all 

Who’ll come a-sailing in Jum- 
buck with me? 

Sailing in Jumbuk, sailing in 
Jumbuk, 

Who'll come a-sailing in Jum- 
buk with me? 

Lost in the galaxy, falling free in 
sweet damn all— 

You'll come a-sailing in Jum- 
buk with me? 

Up jumped the captain, shouted 
to his engineer, 

‘Start me the diesels, one, two, 
three! 

Give me the power to feed into 
the Ehrenhafts 

You'll come a-sailing in Jum- 
buk with me!' 

“But that's oursl" declared Tan- 
ya indignantly, her Australian ac- 
cent suddenly very obvious. “It's 
our Waltzing Matilda'.” 

“ Waltzing Matilda never was 
yours," Grimes told her. The 
words — yes, but the tune, no. Like 



THE MOUNTAIN MOVERS 



87 




many other songs it's always hav- 
ing new verses tacked on to it." 

“I suppose you're right. But 
these comic lyrics of theirs - what 
are they all about?" 

“You've heard of the Ehrenhaft 
Drive, haven't you?" 

“The first FTL Drive?" 

“Yes, you could call it that. The 
Ehrenhaft generators converted 
the ship, the lodejammer, into 
what was, in effect, a huge mag- 
netic particle. As long as she was 
on the right tramlines, the right 
line of magnetic force, she got to 
where she was supposed to get to 
in a relatively short time. But a 
magnetic storm- tangling the 
lines of force like a bowl of 
spaghetti - would throw her any- 
where-- or nowhere. And these 
storms also drained the micro-pile 
of all energy. In such circum- 
stances all that could be done was 
to start up the emergency diesel 
generators to supply electric 
power to the Ehrenhaft gen- 
erators. After this the ship would 
stooge along hopefully, trying to 
find a habitable planet before the 
fuel ran out." 

“ETm." She grinned suddenly. 
“I suppose it's more worthy of 
being immortalized in song than 
our sheep-stealing Jolly Swag- 
man. But 1 still prefer the 
original." And then aided by her 
friend, Moira Stevens a fat and 
cheerful young woman she sang 
what she still claimed was the orig- 
inal version. 



Grimes allowed himself to won- 
der what the ghost of the Jolly 
Swagman -still, presumably, 
haunting that faraway billa- 
bong— -would have made of it all. 



T E1AT night they reached the 
first of their camping sites, a 
clearing in the bush on the banks 
of a river that was little more than 
a trickle. The coach crew there 
was a cook as well as the driver 
set up pneumatic puptents in three 
neat rows, swiftly inflated them 
with a hose from the coach's air 
compressor. Wood was collected 
for a fire and folding grills laid 
across it. 

"The inevitable steak and billy 
tea," muttered somebody who 
had been on the tour before. “It's 
always steak and billy tea." 

But the food, although plain, was 
good, the yarning around the fire 
was enjoyable and Grimes found 
that the air mattress in his tent 
was at least as comfortable as his 
bunk aboard Adder. He slept well 
and awoke refreshed to the sound 
of the taped Reveille, lie was 
among the first in the queue lor the 
toilet facilities and, dressed and 
ready for what the day might bring, 
lined up lor his eggs and bacon and 
mug of tea with a good appetite. 
Then came the washing up, the de- 
flation of mattresses and tents, 
the stowing away of these and the 
baggage and, shortly after the 
bright sun had appeared over the 



88 



GALAXY 




low hills to the east, the tour was 
on its way again. 

It moved now through drought- 
stricken land that showed few 
signs of human occupancy. 
Grimes saw sun-parched plains 
where scrawny cattle foraged list- 
lessly for scraps of grass, where 
tumbleweed scurried across the 
roadway, where dust-devils raised 
their whirling columns of sand and 
light debris. But there was life, 
apart from the thirsty cattle, apart 
from the gray scrub that, with the 
first rains of the wet season, would 
put forth its brief, vivid greenery, 
its short-lived gaudy flowers. Once 
the coach stopped to let a herd of 
sausagekine across the track low- 
slung, furry quadrupeds wriggling 
like huge lizards on their almost 
rudimentary legs. 

There was a great clicking of 
cameras. 

“We're lucky, folks," said the 
driver. "These beasts are almost 
extinct. They were classed as pests 
until only a couple of years 
ago now they've been reclassed 
as protected fauna 

Next came an aboriginal en- 
campment where gaunt, black 
figures, looking arachnoid rather 
than humanoid, stood immobile 
about their cooking fires. 

“Bad bastards those," an- 
nounced the driver. "Most of the 
others will put on shows for us, will 
sell us curios- but not that tribe." 

Now and again Grimes saw 
other vehicles- diesel-engined 



tourist coaches like the one he 
rode, large and small hovercraft 
and, in the cloudless sky. occas- 
ional high-flying inertial-drive 
aircraft. But in the main the land 
was empty, the long, straight road 
seeming to stretch to infinity 
ahead and behind. The little set- 
tlements pub, general store and 
a huddle of other buildings were 
welcome every time that one was 
reached. There was a great con- 
sumption of cold beer at each slop, 
conversations with the locals, 
who gathered as though by magic, 
at each halt. Even coach 
parks concentration camps in 
the desert rather than oases were 
appreciated for hot showers and 
facilities lor washing clothing. 

As the tour progressed Grimes 
and Deane teamed up with Tanya 
and Moira. But there was, as yet, 
no sharing of tents. Grimes gained 
the impression that the girl’s 
mother had told her at an early age 
to beware of spacemen. Come to 
that, after the first two nights 
there were no tents. Now that they 
were in regions where it was cer- 
tain that no rain would fall all 
hands slept in sleeping bags only, 
under the stars. 

They came to the Cragge Rock 
reserve. 

"Cragge Rock," said the driver 
into his microphone, “is named 
after Captain Cragge, master of 
the Lode Jumbuk , just as the 
planet itself is named after his 
wife, Olga." He paused. “Per- 



THE MOUNTAIN MOVERS 



89 




haps somewhere in the Galaxy 
there’s a mountain that will be 
called Grimes Rock but with all 
due respect to the distinguished 
spaceman with us, he'll have to try- 
hard to find the equal to Cragge 
Rock. The Rock, folks, is the 
largest monolith in the known uni- 
verse. It is a solid hunk of granite 
five miles long, a mile across, a 
half-mile high." He turned his at- 
tention to Tanya and Moira. “Big- 
ger than your Ayers Rock, ladies!" 
He waited out a small outburst of 
chuckles. “And to the north, sixty 
miles distant, lies Mount Con- 
way, a typical mesa. Twenty- 
miles to the south is Mount Sarah, 
named after Chief Officer Con- 
way’s wife. It's usually called ‘the 
Sallies,’ since it consists of five 
separate domes of red conglom- 
erate. So you see that geolog- 
ically Cragge Rock doesn't fit in. 
There’s quite a few theories about 
its origins, folks. One is that it was 
formed by a submarine volcanic 
eruption when this was all part of 
the ocean bed - that the Rock was 
an extrusion of molten matter 
from the core of the planet. If so, it 
has been further shaped by mil- 
lions of years of erosion since the 
sea floor rose to become this is- 
land continent." 

The Rock squatted on the sky- 
line, glowering red in the almost 
level rays of the westering sun, an 
enormous crimson slug. It pos- 
sessed beauty of a sort. 

“We spend five full days here. 



folks," went on the driver. 
“There's a hotel and an aboo set- 
tlement-most of the boos speak 
English. They'll be happy to tell 
you their legends about the 
Rock Wuluru they call it. It's 
one of their sacred places, but they 
don't mind us coming here as long 
as we pay for the privilege. 
Basics, of course, are all taken care 
of by the tourist bureau, but if you 
want any curios you'll have to fork 
out to the boos for them. See the 
way the Rock's changing color as 
the sun gets lower? And once the 
sun’s down it’ll slowly fade like a 
dying ember- " 

The R ock was close now, 
towering above them, a red wall 
against the darkening blue of the 
cloudless sky. Then they were in 
its shadow and the sheer granite 
wall was purple, shading to cold 
blue . Sunlight again, like a 
sudden blow, a last circuit of the 
time-pocked monolith and a final 
stop on the eastern side of the stone 
mountain. 

The tourists left the coach, shiv- 
ering a little in the still, chilly air. 

"It has something," Tanya 
whispered. “Something," Moira 
agreed. 

“Ancestral memory?" asked 
Deane. 

“You're prying," snapped the 
fat girl. 

“I’m not, Moira. But I couldn't 
help picking up the strong 
emanation from your minds." 

Tanya laughed. "Like most 



90 



GALAXY 




modern Australians we're a mixed 
lot and in our fully integrated 
society most of us have some ab- 
original blood. But why should 
Moira and I feel so at home 
here both at home and hopeless- 
ly lost?" 

"If you let me probe " sug- 
gested Deane gently. 

"No." 

Grimes sympathised with her. 
He knew all too well what it was 
like to have a trained telepath, no 
matter how high his ethical stan- 
dards, around. 

But he said, "Spooky's to be 
trusted. I know." 

"You might trust him, John. 1 
don't know him well enough." 

"He knows us too bloody well!" 
said Moira. 

"I smell steak," said Grimes, 
changing the subject. 

The four of them walked to the 
open fire, where the evening meal 
was already cooking. 

Ill 

D AWN on the Rock was worth 
waking up early for. Grimes 
stood with the others, blanket- 
wrapped against the cold, and 
watched the great hulk Hush grad- 
ually from blue to purple, from 
purple to pink. Over it and beyond 
it the sky was black, the stars very 
bright, almost as bright as in air- 
less space. Then the sun was up and 
the Rock stood there, a red island 



in the sea of tawny sand, a surf of 
green brush breaking about its 
base. The show was over. The par- 
ty went to the showers and toilets 
and then, dressed, assembled for 
breakfast. 

After the meal they walked from 
the encampment to the Rock. 
Tanya and Moira stayed in the 
company of Grimes and Deane, 
but their manner toward the two 
spacemen was distinctly wary; 
they were suddenly more inter- 
ested in their guidebooks than in 
conversation. Their way passed 
the aboriginal village - a hud- 
dle of crude shelters constructed 
of natural materials and bat- 
tered sheets of plastic. Fires were 
burning and gobbets of unidenti- 
fiable meat were cooking over 
them. Women naked, with strag- 
gling hair and pendulous breasts, 
yet human enough looked up 
and around at the well-clothed, 
well-fed tourists with an odd, sly 
mixture of timidity and boldness. 

One of them pointed to a leveled 
camera and screamed, "First gib- 
bit half dollar!" 

"You'd belter," advised the 
driver. “Very commercial 
minded, these people." 

Men were emerging from the 
primitive huts. One of them ap- 
proached Grimes and his compan- 
ions, his teeth startlingly white in 
his coal-black face. He was hold- 
ing what looked like a crucifix. 

"Very good," he said, waving it 
in front of him. "Two dollar." 



THE MOUNTAIN MOVERS

“I’m not religious--^' Grimes 
began, to be cut short by Tanya's 
laugh. 

“Don’t be a fool, John,” she told 
him. “It's a throwing weapon." 

“A throwing weapon?” 

“Yes. Like our boomerangs. Let 
me show you.” She turned to the 
native, held out her hand. “Here. 
Please.” 

“You throw, missie?" 

“Yes. I throw.” 

Watched by the tourists and the 
natives she held the thing by the 
end of its long arm, turned until 
she was facing about forty-five de- 
grees away from the light morning 
breeze, the flat surfaces of the 
cross at right angles to the wind. 
She raised her arm, threw with a 
peculiar flick of her wrist. The 
weapon left her hand, spinning, 
turned so that it was flying hori- 
zontally, like a miniature heli- 
copter. It traveled about fifty 
yards, came around in a lazy arc, 
faltered, then fell in a flurry of 
fine sand. 

“Not very good,” complained 
the girl. “You got better? You got 
proper one?” 

The savage grinned. “You 
know?” 

“Yes. I know.” 

The man went back into his hut, 
returned with another weapon. 
This one was old, beautifully made 
and lacking the crude designs that 
had been burned into the other with 
redhot wire. He handed it to Tan- 
ya, who hefted it approvingly. 



She threw it as she had thrown the 
first one»»-and the difference was 
immediately obvious. There was 
no clumsiness in its flight, no 
hesitation. It flew more like a 
living thing than a machine. Its 
arms turned more and more lazily 
as it came back and Tanya, with a 
clapping motion, deftly caught it 
between her hands. She stood ad- 
miring it — the smooth finish im- 
parted by the most primitive of 
tools, the polish of age and of long 
use. 

“How much?” she asked. 

“No for sale, missie." Again the 
very white grin. “But I give." 

“I shouldn't, but — " 

“Take it, lady,” said the driver. 
“This man is Najatira, the chief of 
these people. Refusing his gift 
would offend him." Then, busi- 
nesslike: “You guide, Najatira?” 

“Yes. I guide.” 

E BARKED a few words in 
his own language to his wom- 
en, one of whom scuttled over the 
sand to retrieve the first, fallen 
throwing weapon. Then, walking 
fast on his big, splayed feet he 
strode toward the rock. Somehow 
the two girls had ranged them- 
selves on either side of him. Grimes 
looked on disapprovingly. Who 
was it who had said that these 
natives were humanoid only? This 
naked savage, to judge by his ex- 
ternal equipment, was all to hu- 
man. 

“Cave,” said Najatira, pointing.

GALAXY 




The orifice, curiously regular, was 
exactly at the tail of the slug- 
shaped monolith. “Called by my 
people the Hole of Winds. Story 
say in Dream Time wind came 
from there, wind move world. Be- 
fore, world no move. No daytime, 
no nighttime." 

“Looks almost like a venturi. 
Captain," Dean remarked to 
Grimes. 

"Certainly looks almost too reg- 
ular to be natural. But erosion 
does odd things. Or it could have 
been made by a blast of gases from 
the thing's inside." 

“Precisely," said Deane. 

“But you don't think so? No. It 
would have been impossible." 

“I don't know what to think, " 
admitted Deane. 

Their native guide was leading 
them around the base of the Rock. 
“This Cave of Birth. Tonight, 
ceremony. We show you. And 
there look up. What we call the 
fishing net. In Dream Time caught 
big fish." 

“A circuit," muttered Grimes. 
"Exposed by millennia of 
weathering." He laughed. “I’m 
getting as bad as you. Spooky. 
Nature comes up with the most re- 
markable imitations of man- 
made things." 

So it went on, the trudge around 
the base of the monolith, under the 
hot sun, while their tireless guide 
pointed out this and that feature. 
As soon as the older members of 
the party began to show signs of 



distress the driver spoke into his 
wrist transceiver and within a few 
minutes the coach came rumbling 
over the rough track and then, with 
its partial load, kept pace with 
those who were still walking. 
Grimes and Deane were among 
these hardy ones, but only because 
Tanya and Moira showed no signs 
of flagging and because Grimes 
felt responsible lor the women. 
After all, the Survey Service had 
been referred to as the police- 
man of the Galaxy. It was un- 
thinkable that two civilized hu- 
man females should fall for this 
unwashed savage but already 
he knew that civilized human fe- 
males are apt to do the weirdest 
things. 

At last the tour came to an end. 
Najatira, after bowing with sur- 
prising courtesy, strode off toward 
his own camp. The tourists clus- 
tered hungrily around the folding 
tables that had been set up, wolfed 
the sandwiches and gulped tea. 

During the afternoon there were 
Bights over the Rock and the coun- 
tryside lor those who wished them, 
a large blimp having come in from 
the nearest airport for that pur- 
pose. This archaic transport was 
the occasion for surprise and in- 
credulity, but it was. explained 
that such aircraft were used by 
Lode Jumbuk's people for their 
initial explorations. 

“The bloody thing's not safe," 
complained Deane as soon as they 
were airborne. 



THE MOUNTAIN MOVERS

Grimes ignored him. He was 
looking out and down through the 
big cabin windows. Yes, the Rock 
did look odd, out of place. It was 
part of the landscape, but it did 
not belong. It had been there for 
millions of years— but still it did 
not belong. Mount Conway and 
Mount Sarah were natural enough 
geological formations — but, he 
thought, Cragge Rock was just as 
natural. He tried to envision what 
it must have looked like when that 
upwelling of molten rock thrust 
through the ocean bed. 

“It wasn’t like that. Captain,” 
said Deane quietly. 

“Damn you. Spooky — get out of 
my mind.” 

“I’m sorry,” the telepath told 
him, although he didn’t sound it. 
“It’s just that this locality is like a 
jigsaw puzzle. I’m trying to find 
the pieces and make them fit.” He 
looked around to make sure that 
no one else in the swaying, creak- 
ing cabin was listening. “Tanya 
and Moira — The kinship they feel 
with Najatira — ” 

“Why don’t you ask them about 
it?” Grimes suggested, jerking his 
head toward the forward end of 
the car, where the two girls were 
sitting. “Is it kinship — or is it just 
the attraction that a woman on 
holiday feels for an exotic male?” 
“It’s more than that.” 

“So you’re prying.” 

“I’m trying not to." He looked 
down without interest at Mount 
Conway, over which the airship 



was slowly flying. "But it’s hard 
not to." 

“You could get into trouble, 
Spooky. And you could get the 
ship into trouble.” 

“And you, Captain." 

“Yes. And me." Then Grimes 
allowed a slight smile to flicker 
over his face. “But I know you. 
You’re on to something. And as 
we’re on holiday from the ship I 
don't suppose that I can give you 
any direct orders — ” 

“I’m not a space lawyer, so I’ll 
take your word for that.” 

“Just be careful. And keep me 
informed.” 

While they talked the pilot of 
the blimp, his voice amplified, 
had been giving out statistics. The 
conversation had been private 
enough. 

T HAT night there was the dance. 

Flaring fires had been built on 
the sand in a semicircle, the in- 
ner arc of which faced the mouth of 
the Cave of Birth. The tourists sat, 
some on the ground and some on 
folding stools, the fires at their 
backs, waiting. The sky was black 
and clear, the stars bitterly bright. 
From inside the cave came music 

of a sort- a rhythmic wheezing of 

primitive trumpets, the staccato 
rapping of knocking sticks. A 
yelping male voice seemed to be 
giving orders rather than singing. 

Grimes turned to say something 
to Tanya, but she was no longer in 
her place. Neither was Moira. The 



94 



GALAXY 




i wo girls must have gone together 
lo the toilet block; they would be 
back shortly. He returned his at- 
tention to the black entrance to 
the cave. 

The first figure emerged from it, 
crouching, a stick in his hands. 
Then the second, the third — some- 
thing was oddly familiar about the 
ritual, something that didn’t make 
sense or made the wrong kind of 
sense. Grimes tried to remem- 
ber — to decide what it was. Dimly 
he realized that Deane was helping 
him, that the telepath was trying 
lo bring his memories to the con- 
scious level. 

Yes, that was it. That was the 
way the Marines disembarked on 
the surface of an unexplored, 
possibly hostile planet, auto- 
matic weapons at the ready. 

Twelve men were outside the 
cave now, advancing in a dance- 
like step. The crude, tree-stem 
trumpets sounded like the plaint 
of tired machinery and the noise of 
the knocking sticks was that of 
cooling metal. The leader paused, 
stood upright. Fingers in mouth, 
he gave a piercing whistle. 

The women emerged, carrying 
bundles, hesitantly, two steps for- 
ward, one step back. Grimes 
gasped in disbelief. Surely that 
was Tanya, as naked as the 
others— and there was no mis- 
taking Moira. He jumped to his 
feet, ignoring the protests of those 
behind him, trying to shake off 
Deane’s restraining hand. 



“Let go 

“Don’t interfere, Captain!” The 
telepath’s voice was urgent. 
“Don't you see? They’ve gone na- 
tive — no, that’s not right. But 
they’ve reverted. And there’s no 
law against it.” 

“1 can still drag them out of this. 
They’ll thank me after.” He 
turned around and shouted, 
“Come on, all of you! We must put 
a stop to this — ” 

“Captain Grimes.” The coach 
driver’s voice was angry. “Sit 
down, sir. This sort of thing has 
happened before and it’s nothing 
to worry about. The young ladies 
are in no danger.” 

“It's happened before,” agreed 
Deane unexpectedly. “With neu- 
rotic exhibitionists, wanting to 
have their photographs taken 
among the savages. But not this 
way.” 

Then, even more unexpectedly, 
Deane was running out across the 
sand. Najatira advanced to meet 
him, not in hostility but in wel- 
come. 

Grimes yelled, “Come back, 
Spooky— come back here — ” 

He didn't know what was 
happening but he didn’t like it. 
First those two silly bitches — and 
now one of his own officers. What 
the hell was getting into every- 
body? Followed by a half dozen of 
the other men, he ran toward the 
cave’s mouth. His way was barred 
by a line of the tribesmen, holding

their sticks now like spears (which 
they were) not like make-believe 
guns. Najatira stood proudly be- 
hind the armed men and on either 
side of him stood the two girls, a 
strange, arrogant pride in every 
line of their naked bodies. And 
there was Deane, a strange smile 
on his lace, too, seemed suddenly 
to have acquired lines of authority. 

“Go back, John," he ordered. 
"There is nothing that you can 
do." He added softly: "But there is 
much that I can do." 

“What the hell are you talking 
about, Spooky?" 

"I'm an Australian, like Moira 
and Tanya here. Like them, 1 have 
the Old Blood in my veins. Unlike 
them. I'm a spaceman. Do you 
think that after all these years in 
the Service I, with my talent, 
haven't learned how to handle and 
navigate a ship, any ship'? I shall 
lake my people back to where they 
belong." 

A ND then Grimes knew. The 
knowledge came Hooding into 
his mind from the mind of Deane, 
from the minds of the others, 
whose ancestral memories had 
been awakened by the telepalh. 
But he was still responsible. He 
must still try to stop madness. 

“Mr. Deane!" He strode for- 
ward firmly. He brushed aside the 
point of a spear that was aimed at 
his chest. He saw Tanya throw 
something and sneered as it missed 
his head by inches. He did not see

ihe cruciform boomerang return- 
ing, was aware of it only as a crash- 
ing blow from behind, as a Hash of 
crimson light, then darkness. 

He recovered slowly. He was 
stretched out on the sand beside 
the coach. Two of the nurses 
among the passengers were with 
him. 

He asked, as he tried to sit up, 
"What happened?" 

"They all went back into the 
cave," the girl said. “The rock 
the rock closed behind them. And 
there were lights. And a voice, it 
was Mr. Deane's voice, but loud, 
loud, saying, 'Clear the field 
clear the field! Get back, every- 
body — get well back. Get well 
away — ’ So we got well back.” 

"And what's happening now?" 
asked Grimes. The nurses helped 
him as he got groggily to his feet. 
He stared toward the distant 
Rock. He could hear the beat of 
mighty engines and the ground 
was trembling under his feet. 
Lights flashed here and there on 
the surface of the monolith. Even 
with the knowledge that Deane 
had fed into his mind he could not 
believe what he was seeing. 

The Rock was lifting, its highest 
part suddenly eclipsing a bright 
constellation. It was lifting and 
the skin of the planet protested as 
the vast ship, that for so long had 
been embedded in it, tore itself 
free. Tremors knocked the tour- 
ists from their feet but somehow 
Grimes remained standing, ob- 



livious to the shouts and screams. 
He heard the crash behind him as 
the coach was overturned but he 
did not look. 

The Rock was lifting, had lifted. 
It was a deeper blackness against 
the blackness of the sky, a scat- 
tering of strange, impossible 
stars against the distant stars, a 
bright cluster at first that dimmed 
and diminished, that dwindled 
faster and faster and then was 
gone, leaving in its wake utter 
darkness and silence. 

The silence was broken by the 
coach driver. 

He said slowly, “I’ve had to cope 
with vandalism in my time— but 
nothing like this. What the Board 
will say when they hear that their 
biggest tourist attraction has 
gone I hate to think about—” He 
seemed to cheer up slightly. “But it 
was one of your officers. Captain 
Grimes, from your ship, who did it. 

I hope you enjoy explaining it!" 

G RIMES explained, as well as he 
was able, to Commander Le- 
win. 

He said, “As we all know, sir, 
there are these odd races, human 
rather than humanoid, all 
through the Galaxy. It all ties in 
with the Common Origin of 
Mankind theories. I never used to 
have much time for them myself, 
but now— ^ 

“Never mind that. Grimes. Get 
on with the washing."

to let loose a Hood of knowledge 
into my mind just before that 
blasted Tanya clonked me with 
her boomerang. It seems that mil- 
lions of years ago these stone 
spaceships, these hollowed out as- 
teroids, were sent to explore this 
Galaxy. I got only a ha/y idea of 
their propulsive machinery bu), 
it was something on the lines of 
our inertial drive and something 
on the lines of our Mannschenn 
Drive, with auxiliary rockets for 
maneuveing in orbit and so 
forth. They w'ere never meant to 
land but they could, if they had 
to. Their power? Derived from the 
conversion of matter, any mat- 
ter, with the generators or con- 
verters ready to start up when the 
right button was pushed but the 
button had to be pushed 
psionically. Get me!" 

“Not very well. But go on.” 
“Something happened to this 
ship, to the crew and passengers 
of this ship. A disease, I think it 
was, wiping out almost all the 
adults, leaving only children and a 
handful of not very intelligent 
ratings. Somebody - it must have 
been one of the officers just be- 
fore he died — got the ship down 
somehow'. He set things so that it 
could not be reentered until 
somebody with the right qualifi- 
cations came along.” 

“The right qualifications?” 

“Yes. Psionic talents, more than 
a smattering of astronautics and 
descended from the Old People.” 



“Like your Mr. Deane. But what 
about the two girls?” 

“They had the Old Blood. And 
they were highly educated. And 
they could have been latent tele- 
paths.” 

“Could be.” Lewin smiled with- 
out much mirth. "Meanwhile, 
Lieutenant, 1 have to try to ex- 
plain to the Olganan government, 
with copies to operators of trans- 
galactic clippers and to our own 
masters, including your Commo- 
dore Damien. All in all, Grimes, it 
was a fine night’s work. Apart 
from the Rock, among those who 
left or were kidnaped were two TG 
passengers and a Survey Service 
officer 

“And the tribe.” 

“The least of the Olganan gov- 
ernment’s worries and nothing at 
all to do with TG or ourselves. 
Even so - ” This time his smile was 
tinged with genuine, but sar- 
donic, humor. 

“Even so?” echoed Grimes. 

“What if those tribesmen and 
women decide to liberate I sup- 
pose that’s the right word those 
other tribespeople, the full- 
blooded ones who’re still living in 
the vicinity of the other stone 
spaceship? What if the Aus- 
tralians realize, one sunny morn- 
ing, that their precious Ayers Rock 
has up and left them?” 

“1 know who'll be blamed," said 
Grimes glumly. 

“How right you are,” concur- 
red Lewin. ★

W HEN, after dinner, Harvey 
Adam sat down before the 
communication alcove and keyed 
Myra’s number the puzzle and 
excitement of his unusual day 
dropped away from him. As the 
alcove glowed with the light of 
Myra's room he experienced that 
part of his life which, now old, was 
yet ever fresh and new. He saw her 
in profile, sealed at her dressing 
table. She wore a soft, thin gown 
which hung in gentle folds about 
her body. She was looking at her- 
self in the mirror, her head tilted 
back a little. The outlines of her 
forehead, nose, mouth and chin 
had the classic regularity which he 
admired so much but could never 
quite recollect except in seeing her. 
The slight and unusual rounding of 
her features saved their perfec- 
tion from severity and made him 
feel ever protective. The dressing 
table was littered with bottles and 
a tissue had fallen to the floor. It 
lay incongruously on the soft, 
deep-pile rug at her right. 

Myra ignored the calling signal 
for a moment, continuing her ex- 
amination : Then she turned slow- 
ly and smiled at him. 

“Harvey,” she said in her soft, 
warm voice. ”1 was expecting 
you.” The tissue on the floor 
caught her eye. With a slightly 
vexed expression she leaned over 
to pick it up. The loose, low-cut 
bodice of the gown fell away from 
her body, revealing a perfect 
breast. With her hand on the tissue 



she looked up and smiled for a mo- 
ment. “I'm messy,” she said. She 
quickly stuffed the tissue in the 
disposal and sat up, touching her 
blond hair lightly with her hands. 
The gesture showed her arms to 
perfection. 

“And did you have a good day, 
dear?” Myra asked. 

“Good but exciting,” he replied. 
“1 don't want to talk shop tonight, 
Myra. Just talk. And just see you. 
What did you do today?” 

“Oh, nothing that would in- 
terest a historian,” she replied. 

“You must have done some- 
thing,” he coaxed. 

“All right, then, I bought this 
gown," she told him, standing and 
walking toward him. The filmy 
material fell sheer and straight, 
outlining her figure wherever it 
touched the points of her breasts, 
the roundness of her belly. He 
could see the rest of her body dim- 
ly through the fabric, more teasing 
and tantalizing than bare flesh. 
She turned around once, then faced 
him and asked anxiously, “Do you 
like it?” 

“Immensely,” he said. “Every 
woman should have one.” 

She looked a little hurt. 

“But it especially suits you.” 

She smiled in mock relief. She 
moved the soft, light, comfort- 
able chair from the dressing table 
to face him and sat down, her legs 
outlined by the translucent gown. 

“Where did you find it?” he 
asked.

The conversation turned to shop- 
ping and to the trivialities of the 
day. which Myra seemed to find of 
consuming interest. Harvey 
found this very touching and 
amusing. But gradually, their in- 
terest returned to the gown. 
Harvey remarked on the texture. 

“Would you like to feel if?" 
Myra asked. Harvey did, putting 
his hand through the filmy barrier 
at the face of the communication 
booth. As the barrier which gave 
him access to Myra's communi- 
cation booth gave way his hand 
obscured his view of Myra where 
it passed through the film. But he 
felt the material of the gown be- 
tween his fingers. Then he felt 
Myra's softness through the gown. 
The slithery softness of the fabric 
added a sensation all its own. 
Myra's hand came toward him, a 
shapely gray ghost emerging 
from the film. His vision clouded 
as the shimmering hand pushed 
him on the chest. 

“Go away,” Myra said. “I 
thought you wanted to talk.'' 

Harvey grabbed the hand and 
pulled their bodies together. “I 
do,” he said in a whisper, pressing 
his face through the film toward 
an unseen ear. 

“Don’t muss the gown," Myra 
said in alarm (simulated, he 
thought). 

“Then take it off," he told her as 
she drew back. He could see her 
again. 

“Really?" she asked, smiling. 



He nodded solemnly. "Really." 

Bending toward hint,, she took 
the hem of the gown lightly in both 
hands and slowly raised it, gath- 
ering folds of cloth into her hands. 
She smiled and raised the gown 
over her head; her face emerged 
and she stood with arms upthrust, 
naked. 

“You and me," he said with a 
chuckle. Quickly he stepped 
through the film of the communi- 
cation cubicle to put his arms 
about Myra. All sight was gone 
now but he could feel whatever his 
hands and body sought. 

L ATER that night, after he and 
Myra had rung off, he lay in bed 
and thought of the goodness of 
life. Satisfaction was dearly 
bought. There had been the years 
of childhood, the peer group, the 
computer tutoring, the minors 
who tended one by assignment, 
not from choice. There had been 
the troubled lime of adolescence: 
intellectual yearning without 
the intellectual discipline necessary 
for fulfillment; and physical yearn- 
ing which dissolved into frankly 
curious explorations and selfish 
conflicts of personality. 

Mating and parenthood were 
touching for those who were 
chosen (he had been). But, each 
knew that he had been chosen. 
Mating was a rite, a duty. It could 
be moving; it could be exasperat- 
ing; it could be frantic. But one 
was chosen; one did not do his own 



CHOICE 



101 




choosing. Only in adulthood did 
one have the competence and abil- 
ity to select the work one was able 
to pursue with confidence of suc- 
cess. Only in adulthood could one 
search the whole world for friends 
like his Harvey's friends, Myra 
and Donald. The computer had 
been an aid in finding them but 
the choice had been his own. 

In his euphoria of self-con- 
gratulation Harvey Adam forgot 
the challenge and excitement of 
a day which had put him off his 
schedule for a whole hour. He sank 
into restful, blissful sleep. 

To have missed schedule by an 
hour was an anomaly in his life. A 
modestly self-acknowledged gen- 
ius, he prided himself on order as 
well as achievement. There was a 
time and a place for everything 
for work, for sport, for friends. 
For calm enjoyment, each had 
its- his, her place. 

Ordinarily he left the library at 
five o'clock, stepping from his 
anachronistic office into the 
transportation cubicle to which his 
merit entitled him. In less than a 
minute he was at the athletic club, 
delivered directly to the locker 
room. There he stripped and zipped 
his spare but handsome body into 
his clinging sports suit. Cords 
gathered up and goggles in hand, 
he went through the door marked 
skiing. He stepped on the plat- 
form, placed his feet in the sockets 
and touched a button. The sock- 
ets gripped his feet and ankles 



firmly. He plugged in the cords. 
After a moment's thought, he 
typed ALTA on the keyboard. He 
put his hands through the dangling 
leather loops. Standing upright, 
knees slightly bent, he pulled the 
goggles over his noble features. 

Simulation was different from 
communication with another hu- 
man being. Sight and touch went 
together. There was no barrier 
between himself and the world in 
which he found himself. To all his 
senses to all at once Harvey 
was standing on sun-drenched 
snow. He looked admiringly 
down familiar slopes, up at the 
sparkling mountains, the clear 
horizon and the deep blue of the 
cloudless sky. The air was almost 
still. The dry, newfallen snow was 
scarcely touched. He could see 
two tiny skiers far below, sweep- 
ing slowly into and out of sight as 
they turned and twisted. Grasping 
the poles that hung from his wrists, 
he pushed himself forward, en- 
chanted by the effortless glide of 
the skis on the snow. The cold air 
blew keenly against his cheeks, 
contrasting pleasantly with the 
warmth of the sun. He made a 
long, swift traverse and, turning 
in a flurry of powder, was away 
down a familiar and favorite 
course. 

, But many courses are familiar. 
He could have chosen the narrow, 
windy, changing trails of Stowe or 
Sugarbush in the east. He could 
have skied Zermatt in the 



102 



GALAXY 




Alps or down the valley under 
the cable railway spanning the 
glacier of Mont Blanc or in the 
mountains of South America or 
New Zealand. Tens of skiing sites 
were stored in the club's com- 
puter, complete in every geo- 
graphical detail, each programed 
lor a variety of weather and for 
every possible choice and motion 
of the skier. Each user had the run 
to himself, save for distant 
phantoms who added interest. All 
depended on skill, on his skill at 
testing himself against the moun- 
tain and the snow. It was not as 
good as the real thing it was 
better. 

Once Harvey had gone all the 
way to Zermatt to make sure, de- 
spite the danger of injury in case 
of a fall. He had had to be fitted 
with ski boots by a grumpy, sub- 
standard human attendant. He 
had had to lace them on, an 
onerous and unfamiliar task. A 
chair lift had taken him uncom- 
fortably to the top of the slope. 
The weather had been dull, the 
snow tracked by loo many others. 
The trip had been instructive but 
the day had been wasted as sport. 

So, at five o’clock of every day, 
Harvey enjoyed betler-lhan-real 
skiing at the athletic club. Or, for 
variety, it might be better-than- 
real surfing on the most magnifi- 
cent rollers in the world. Or out of 
it. It might be superb sailing 
across sparkling seas in an eight- 
een-looter. Then Harvey sailed 



against phantom boats with phan- 
tom yachtsmen, subject to the 
same wind and currents. The 
phantoms sailed as well as a parti- 
tion. of the computer could sail 
them, not knowing what gusts an- 
other partition would subject them 
to. Sailing is chancy. Harvey fre- 
quently beat the phantoms. 

Some men played tennis, 
squash, or even soccer against 
phantom opponents. Harvey re- 
garded this as beneath human 
dignity. One used machines. One 
had dealings with people. 

But today at five-thirty o'clock, 
Harvey had not been zipped into 
his sports suit, experiencing the ski 
slopes of Alta, or the rollers of 
Oahu, or sailing off the coast of 
Maine. He had been at his 
anachronistic wooden desk in his 
anachronistic office at the library, 
holding an anachronistic book in 
his hand and reading it avidly. The 
book was Recognizing Patterns , 
edited by P.A. Kolers and M. 
Eden, MIT Press, 1968. One chap- 
ter of the book had put him on a 
new trail. 



O VER some hundreds of years, 
computers had supplied man's 
goods and implemented man's ser- 
vices with admirable efficiency. 
They flexibly embodied all man’s 
discoveries and inventions and 
wholly automated the routines of 
production and service, includ- 
ing the teaching of such intel- 



CHOICE 



103 




leclual skills as languages and 
mathematics. Computers also ac- 
cumulated cross-indexed, ab- 
stracted and reproduced on de- 
man all of man's recorded knowl- 
edge, wisdom, speculations, art 
and his everything else, with an 
antlike energy and a pack-rat 
thoroughness that were less and 
more than human. 

Agronomists, surgeons, physi- 
cists continually edited their cur- 
rent files. These were used in the 
teaching and practicing of their 
arts. Good or bad, that which was 
eliminated from the current files 
was not lost; it was retained in sec- 
ondary storage, where it was me- 
chanically related to an accumula- 
tion of centuries in an increasingly 
inaccessible jumble of data about 
what the world was and was not 
like, about events that had or had 
not taken place, about men w<ho 
had or had not lived. 

1 n the age of the dowering of the 
computer, men had been so re- 
lieved, surprised and enchanted 
with human progress that they 
took the old for granted while de- 
manding the new. Some success- 
ful part of that new was then added 
to the taken-for-granted old. No 
one asked when or how the world 
of now had come to be. The past 
became buried in a mountain of 
uncritically accumulated detail. 
All this was instantly accessible 
electronically, but it far out- 
weighed human ability to com- 
prehend or verify. It became a 



junk-pile of data, inaccessible to 
the human mind. 

Or was it inaccessible.’ A few 
men were interested in that prob- 
lem. A very few, like Harvey, tried 
to turn the computer on itself in 
ferreting out a track through the 
past. Formidable obstacles lay in 
the way. Harvey had had to learn 
how the computers and the ma- 
chines they controlled really 
worked. He had traveled strange 
byways. 

Many men could feed new loca- 
tions or games into the sports 
simulators. Flarvey was one of 
the very few who really knew- how 
the simulators simulated. He 
could have programed into them 
(as had been done ages ago) the 
complex shifts of point of view 
which accompanied a rapid turn 
or a tumble into the snow. It had 
been gratifying to him to notice 
for the first time the slight graini- 
ness that accompanied processor 
overload during such sequences. 

Harvey's studies took him to 
things less familiar than the sports 
simulators. Behind the electronic 
records, he had found, were early 
microfiche cards. These he lo- 
cated in a library building, where 
he then made his office. After 
sending little servodriven con- 
structs through passages inacces- 
sible to human beings, he had at 
last held a microfiche card tri- 
umphantly in his hand. Behind 
microfiche, he had discovered 
printed books. Those that seemed 



104 



GALAXY 




relevant to the trail he sought now 
lined the shelves above and beside 
his desk. His latest find The 
Kolers-Eden collaboration con- 
tained a chapter by J. Weizen- 
baum, called Contextual Under- 
standing by Computers. 

The chapter described a trivial 
twentieth-century computer pro- 
gram which “conversed" by tele- 
typewriter as unintelligibly as a 
twentieth -century psychiatrist, 
giving trite and ambiguous but 
leading responses to human 
questions or statements. The pro- 
gram worked through key words 
and a superficial analysis of punc- 
tuation and grammatical struc- 
ture. All of this was small and dull. 
But, there were two astonishing 
and exciting points. 

O N EXPECTEDLY, many who 
had participated in the experi- 
ment had persisted in believing 
that there was a human being at 
the other end of the teletypewriter 
link, even when told otherwise. 
The ambiguous responses “Seemed 
pertinent. With the conversation 
went a sense of communion. 
Whence? Harvey wondered. Self- 
communion it must have been, 
born of wish, not fact. But, he re- 
flected, all men were given to self- 
communion, to recollection, fan- 
tasy and imaginary conversations 
with others. In self-communion, 
things always turned out the way 
one wished. Self-communion was 
empty. 



The second, more exciting point, 
was that in that dim and distant 
day some men had believed that 
computers could think even as 
men do. A logician named Turing 
had put it very well in a paper in a 
journal called Mind. If in conver- 
sation you could not distinguish a 
computer from a human being, 
could you say that the computer 
did not think? Harvey had touched 
the keyboard in inquiry and had 
found Mind hopelessly obscured 
in lists of references. Tomorrow, 
he had thought. Tor he had sud- 
denly realized that he had over- 
stayed his usual lime of departure 
by an hour. He had left directly 
for his apartment, his mind churn- 
ing with a new thought, his senses 
on a new track. 

At the beginning of an era, he 
had reflected, man had misjudged 
the most powerful force in his 
hands. Computers as thinking 
beings, indeed? And men who could 
not distinguish a machine from an- 
other human being? These thoughts 
and what part they had or had not 
played in man's past, had dis- 
tracted him through an unsatis- 
factory dinner. Finally his good 
sense, his value of order, had reas- 
serted itself. Everything to its 
place. Work and sport. Inquiry 
and friendship. Too much of one 
spoiled the other. Harvey had dis- 
missed his speculations and, with 
familiar and pleasant anticipa- 
tion, had called Myra and passed 
the pleasant evening already re-

counted. At the end of it. he had 
fallen into blissful sleep. He awoke 
refreshed and ready to meet the 
day’s new challenge. 

Some men work best in the 
morning, sinking into confused 
fatigue as the day passes. Others do 
not really wake up until the eve- 
ning advances. Harvey despised 
both failings. He was always ready 
for the task at hand. He awoke 
clear-eyed, stepped into the fresher, 
and emerged clean-bodied. Dress- 
ing in the clothing his dispenser 
provided, eating his usual spare 
breakfast -these took little time. 
Shortly he stepped into the trans- 
portation cubicle and thence into 
his office, exactly on schedule. 

Harvey faced an untidy desk, but 
that was soon set in order. With 
the book in front of him, his fin- 
gers on the console, he made and 
edited a very brief list. Locate the 
article by Turing. Trace it back- 
ward if possible, forward certainly . 
He pondered a few moments. 
That was all he could think of as a 
start. 

He located the article in a 
quarter of an hour and skimmed 
through it with interest. He ad- 
mired Turing’s examples and 
thought his exact phrasing of the 
problem fitting: 

“The new form of the problem 
can be described in terms of a 
game which we call the ‘imitation 
game.’ It is played with three peo- 
ple, a man (A), a woman (B), and 
an interrogator (C) who may be 



of either sex. The. interrogator 
slays in a room apart from the 
other two. The object of the game 
for the interrogator is to deter- 
mine which of the other two is the 
man and which the woman. 

“We now ask the question, 
‘What will happen when a ma- 
chine takes the part of A in this 
game?’ " 

Backward tracing from Tur- 
ing’s paper proved a sterile task. 
With their mechanical thorough- 
ness of cross-referencing by as- 
sociated words and descriptors the 
computers had provided count- 
less trails into the past, all of them 
false or profitless. 

The tracing into the future was 
bewildering. It led him into a 
strange field called artificial 
intelligence , an agglomeration of 
unproductive work in which it 
was hard to find any unifying or 
identifying principles except 
confusion and enthusiasm. Of 
course computers could prove 
theorems but left to themselves 
they did not create new mathe- 
matics interesting or useful to 
men. Rather, they endlessly 
elaborated, as they had in burying 
man’s past in meaningless detail. 
Computers could play games, 
could pile up blocks like a child, 
could perform some recognition 
tasks. 

Harvey already knew this. Those 
who worked on artificial intelli- 
gence must have known it. What 
they, like their machines, had 



106 



GALAXY 




lacked was human purpose. The 
sports simulators which he en- 
joyed, the computers he was using 
in finding a track through the past, 
were admirable because man had 
adapted them to human need, not 
because they aped nature or 
human function. Who would ad- 
mire an airplane which aped a 
bird, landing in a tree and cling- 
ing to a limb? Who would admire 
a second-rate copy of a human 
being? Especially when com- 
puters could do so many things that 
unaided man could not do? 

In this morass Harvey found lit- 
tle that informed him, but a few 
things that amused him. One was 
an actual record of an engineer 
maliciously badgering Weizen- 
baum's “doctor" program. The 
computer wrote in capitals, the 
man in lower case letters. Part of 
the printout ran:

I T WAS a strange document. 

Such behavior toward a human 
being might have indicated griev- 
ance or cruelty. Perhaps there 
was grievance or cruelty, Harvey 
thought — but directed toward 
whom? At Weizenbaum rather

than at the insensate machine? 
Or, self-directed? 

The other thing that amused 
Harvey he found in a letter on 
speech recognition, in the Journal 
of the Acoustical Society oj Ameri- 
ca, October 1969. He read: 

“It is reasonable to believe that 
Turing's game may best be ap- 
proached with the sort of artful 
deceit that men use in conversa- 
tion when they want to hide their 
ignorance and make the most of 
their knowledge. It would per- 
haps be easier for a speaking com- 
puter to convince the listener that 
it was so deep as to be unintelli- 
gible, and had a cold or spoke with 
a Merovingian accent, than it 
would be lor a speaking computer 
to understand what was said and 
replay sensibly in good, lifelike 
general American." 

Harvey sat back and thought. 
What strange goings-on at the be- 
ginning of the computer age. 
■Kepler, he had read, was fas- 
cinated by astrology and a sort of 
numerology; he had believed in 
an arithmetical order of the solar 
system and in the music of the 
spheres. With the future in their 
hands, these early computer men 
had turned their gaze whither? 

And yet, he thought, there was 
an insidious plausibility about 
this. He himself had been taught 
many things by computer pro- 
grams. He still used some oc- 
casionally. He had never thought 
of them as humanlike, but rather. 



as fascinating mechanical games, 
with a reward of understanding 
lor success. How easily it might 
have been otherwise. 

When a query went outside of 
the content of a program the ma- 
chine would respond, for ex- 
ample: “The answer lies in the 
fields of rings and lattices. If you 
want instruction, please key 547- 
3750." But what if the machine 
had responded: “That was a clever 
question, Harvey, one that I can't 
answer. But I have a very good 
friend who knows, and he would be 
glad to tell you. Would you like me 
to introduce you to him?" 

That, and some of the features 
of the sports simulator, might 
have fooled even me, Harvey 
thought, when I was a child at 
least . 

The day before Harvey had been 
so absorbed that he had not no- 
ticed the passage of time. This af- 
ternoon he kept his eye on the 
clock during musings which had, 
for some reason, become dis- 
turbing to him. He left promptly 
at five. At the athletic club he 
skied down the twisting trails at 
Stowe. The day's speculations re- 
curred to him at inopportune mo- 
ments and he fell twice, without in- 
jury, of course. He would have 
been infuriated if he allowed him- 
self such an indulgence, but he 
had to admit Lo disquiet. 

A T HOME, he ate his dinner 
■ without the usual enjoyment.

When he called his friend Donald 
he felt that he really needed hu- 
man companionship. Was he per- 
haps dependent, he wondered. 
Did he need more than human 
companionship? Did he need 
someone's help? 

The very sight of Donald in- 
spired trust. Solid, gray, with a 
lined but strong face, he was sealed 
in a shapeless but comfortable 
chair before a wood fire, smoking 
his briar pipe. Harvey had often 
wondered whether the fire were 
real or simulated. Donald had 
only smiled when he had asked. 

The silky black cocker spaniel at 
Donald's feet stirred uneasily, its 
right hind leg twitching, then set- 
tled again into quiet contentment. 
Donald turned slowly toward 
Harvey, took the pipe from his 
mouth and smiled slightly. 

"Smoky has dreams, too, Har- 
vey,” he said. "What are your 
dreams tonight?” 

Harvey fell the wonderful calm 
that Donald’s presence always 
brought. But he still experienced 
a trace of the undiagnosable un- 
ease that his discoveries and re- 
flections had brought him. 

"It isn't dreams tonight, Don- 
ald," he replied. “It's my work 
and what I think about it." 

Donald nodded seriously and at- 
tentively. “Do you want to tell me 
about your work and your 
thoughts?” he asked. 

Harvey launched into his ex- 
planation: Turing's assertion 



that a machine which could not be 
distinguished from a human be- 
ing could not be said not to think. 
The artificiaUintelligence cultists 
who had wanted to use the com- 
puter, not for what it was, but to 
imitate human functions. Weizen- 
baum’s simple-minded computer 
program which fooled some sim- 
ple-minded people into believing 
that they were communicating with 
a human being. The assertion that 
Turing’s test could be met by clev- 
er deceit and fraud rather than by 
objective performance. How suc- 
cessful a fraud might be if one 
used today's computers and to- 
day’s simulation. 

Donald listened, attentive and 
sympathetic, puffing on his pipe, 
nodding at Harvey's assertions, 
looking expectant during pauses 
and urging, “Go on, man,” or, “1 
see," when the pause was long. 

Finally Harvey ran down. Like 
most men who have something to 
say, he was forced to stop when he 
had said it. Donald stared at the 
fire, pulling occasionally at his 
pipe. 

"What do you make of it, 
Donald?" Harvey demanded im- 
patiently. 

Donald looked up. 

"Does it bother you, Harvey?” 
he asked seriously. 

“It bothers me very much," 
Harvey answered almost rudely. 

"I can see that it does,” Donald 
said sadly and gravely. “I can see 
that it does."

Harvey fell contrite. Donald had 
been his friend, his confessor, his 
comforter for so long. And now he 
had troubled Donald. 

"What should 1 do?" he asked. 

Donald knocked the dottle from 
his pipe on the fender. 

“You should play a game of 
chess with me," he said kindly but 
decisively. 

That was always Donald's 
remedy, Harvey thought. And a 
good one, too. It always worked. 
It a-l-w-a-y-s w-o-r-k-e-d — A hor- 
rid thought struck Harvey. 
Sounds came from his mouth with- 
out willing or thinking. 

“Bumpfun sun billig Tenter 
bright today." 

“It was a fine day, Harvey," 
Donald said without surprise, 
pulling his chair around and tak- 
ing the chessboard and pieces 
from a drawer in the table beside 
him. 

“Blemp spelkins, morter hark," 
Harvey announced. 

Donald looked up as if he hadn't 
caught the sense of the words. Har- 
vey remained grimly silent. 
Donald looked as if he w-ere think- 
ing. 

“1 wouldn't say that, Harvey,” 
Donald finally asserted, looking 
troubled. 

“Why shouldn't I say it?" 
Harvey demanded. 

“It isn't like you, Harvey,” 
Donald told him. 

“Why isn’t it like me?" Harvey 
asked. 



“Come on, man, let’s start the 
game," it urged. 

The program that is Donald has 
come to the end of one subroutine, 
Harvey thought icily, and the best 
it can do is to try another. Calmly 
he turned the communicator off 
while Donald was putting the 
pieces on the board. Or while 
what was happening? Presum- 
ably a simple simulator program 
was generating a new visual 
aspect of objects whose descrip- 
tions were stored in memory. 

H ARVEY'S icy, analytical calm 
persisted for a few minutes 
more. Was the entire world a toy 
for his amusement or instruc- 
tion? No, his childhood peer group 
had been real enough. He had seen 
and touched its members without 
simulator or computer. Ultimate- 
ly he had lain with some of them. 
He could almost feel the reality 
now, the awkward conflict of will 
and interest, the imperfections in 
the body of Mary, mother of his 
last child. Mary of the slightly 
fallen breasts, hips too broad and 
knobby knees. 

But then, was the communicator 
a communicator at all or only a 
simulator which presented what a 
deluded Harvey really wanted: 
faint echoes of his thoughts and de- 
sires in Donald, the companion in 
chess. And in Myra— what? 

He remembered Mary’s number. 
He keyed it into the com- 
municator. From off-screen he

hoard a faint: “Damn the thing I 
thought I'd turned it off.” 

The voice sounded like Mary's. 
Mary was the early-awake, early- 
tired, early-do/ing-off kind. 

A bleary-eyed woman stumbled 
naked into sight, squinting with 
sleepy eyes into the screen. The 
body was heavier than he remem- 
bered Mary's to be, the breasts 
droopier, the hips wider and the 
knees the same. 

"Harvey," she said. “What on 
earth are you calling for, damn 
you?" 

Harvey turned off the com- 
municator. He had seen all he 
needed to see and heard all he 
needed to hear. That was Mary. 
How well he knew her. Unreal as 
Donald might be, the communi- 
cator was a communicator. With 
a growing hope, he keyed Myra's 
number, Myra whom he had cho- 
sen, Myra whom he had grown 



to love. On w'hom he depended - 
even more than on Donald. 

And he saw Myra sitting on the 
deep-pile rug. her legs folded over 
one another. A scissors and 
nail file lay beside her. She held her 
left fool in her right hand and was 
examining it intently. The 
graceful curve of her back and neck 
were perfection. She looked up 
and smiled. 

“Hello, Harvey," she said and 
started to rise. As she leaned over 
slightly, he could see perfect 
breasts through the low-cut neck of 
her gown. He spoke in cold de- 
spair. 

“Uggle waggle love you," he as- 
serted. 

Myra's eyes grew misty and she 
smiled tremulously. 

“And I love you, loo, Harvey,” 
she said. "We love together." 

Harvey turned off the com- 
municator. it

SCIENCE FICTION REVIEW 

P 0. Box 3116. Santa Monica, Cal. 90403 



in 







L ARRY NIVEN, in the unlikely 
event that you didn’t already 
know, is a shining example of what 
can be done by the technologically 
oriented writer of science fiction. 
When he describes a machine, not 
only do you believe that it would 
actually work, but he can go on to 
build layer after layer of detail in- 
to his stories, based on the events 
which must logically have led to the 
invention of the machine, the im- 
mediate social implications of the 
machine, and the eventual histori- 
cal turning points implicit in the 
machine's existence. What I'm 
saying is he’s a kind of combina- 
tion of George O. Smith and E.E. 
Smith, but 1 also want to point out 
that Niven has a sharply defined 
and engaging literary personality 
all his own. 



He's been going along for some 
years now, turning out superior 
short fiction and a pair of rather 
good novels called A Gift from 
Earth and World of Ptavvs , both 
published by Ballantine along with 
his short story collection, Neutron 
Star. 

Now Ballantine has brought out 
Ringworld (Ballantine Book 
02046.4.095, 95c). Ballantine bills 
it as “The first major novel from a 
hard-core science-fiction writ- 
er," which is by way of begging 
the question on World of Ptavvs 
and A Gift From Earth. 

(In as much as Ballantine origin- 
ally popularized the term “hard- 
core pornography" we don’t even 
have to ask what the term “hard- 
core science fiction" may be in- 
tended to mean). 



112 




Anyway, Niven has here written 
an excellent and entertaining 
science-fiction story in book 
length. Its social background is 
consistent with the universe 
depicted in his previous two 
Ballantine novels, and with the lead 
story in Neutron Star. 

It does range farther and wider 
in scope than his previous works. It 
contains one genuinely mind-bog- 
gling concept a ring-shaped arti- 
ficial world, large enough to circle 
its sun; as if someone had drawn a 
circle in space at, say, the Earth's 
mean orbital distance. 

This fantastic construction, sev- 
eral hundred thousand miles in 
width and millions of miles long, is 
the eventual site of all sorts of ad- 
ventures shared by Niven's four 
principal characters, who are 
Louis Wu, a human; Nessus, a 
Pierson’s puppeteer; Speaker to 
Animals, a kzin; and Teela 
Brown, not only human, nubile 
and uninhibited, but the fortunate 
recipient of a brand of luck rep- 
resenting a social concept by 
Niven on a par with the techno- 
logical imagination he displays. 

The whole story, which is 
basically a Grail-hunting adven- 
ture, is woven together very skill- 
fully and proceeds at a pretty 
smooth pace. I have minor quib- 
bles about the length of time it 
takes Niven to get his characters 
to the Ringworld, and then there 
are a few meaningless traveloguey 
episodes on the Ringworld. (In gen- 



eral, Niven has not done much bet- 
ter at solving some of the problems 
inherent in this kind of story than 
Jack Vance did in Big Planet. 
When you write an action story 
laid on such a hugh geographical 
canvas, you're handicapped by hav- 
ing to describe what happened dur- 
ing the tens of thousands of miles 
your characters had to cross to get 
from one scene of action to the 
next.) Niven doesn’t always use 
these interstices in his action plot 
to do the most efficient job possi- 
ble of advancing his protagon- 
ist’s gradual deduction of the 
true nature of their mission. But 
all I really mean to say by that is 
that although all the episodes are 
enjoyable, not all advance the plot, 
and this may possibly annoy 
you. On the othe.r hand, it may 
charm you (I've only recently 
discovered that there are people 
who are not charmed by Niven's 
storytelling style). 

I also think that Niven’s premise 
depends on evolution’s operating 
very quickly in one instance and far 
too slowly in another. That’s a 
far more serious quibble, because 
this contradictory assertion is 
fundamental to the story. On that 
basis I'd give this book three stars 
out of a possible four. That ain’t 
bad. 

K eith Roberts, author of 

Pavanne , is now back with us 
with The Inner Wheel (Doubleday, 
$4.95), a novel about people with 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



113 




various psionic powers who group 
together to form gestalt personali- 
ties in various little out-of-the-way 
places in England. 

Pavanne , as you should 
remember, was an excellent book 
composed of short episodes in the 
history of an alternate-world Eng- 
land dominated by steam tech- 
nology, the Roman Catholic 
church and the weighty, pallid 
hand of medievalism. What 
emerged was an impressive 
literary achievement for this field; 
a book whose very structure and 
style were in exact harmony with 
its theme. Episodic, moody and 
picked out in elaborate detail, 
Pavanne sustained itself master- 
fully through all but its final epi- 
sode (in which a gratuitous intru- 
sion of the “real” world tended to 
strike a false note, as if someone 
had come along with an STP 
sticker for one of the boats on the 
Bayeaux tapestry. 

The Inner Wheel is written in 
three episodes, one of them first- 
person for no particular reason. 
The book is also quite full of 
elaborate detail and is therefore 
in trouble, because its structure is 
neither homogeneous enough to 
tell a coherent story well, nor 
broken up enough to be a perhaps 
effective mosaic. Along this line 
one might argue that the book is 
structured to represent the less 
than perfect facade one would get 
from contact with a gestalt mind. 
However, if that was Keith Rob- 
erts’ intention, unfortunately the 



effect failed. 

Now that doesn't mean The 
Inner Wheel is a bad book. It 
simply means that on a number of 
levels it’s not as good a book in its 
own terms as Pavanne was. 

It does reveal some interesting 
things about Keith Roberts, a 
w riter whose talent justifies and 
arouses in us a high degree of 
curiosity as readers of potential 
future books by this man. 

For one charming thing, it’s ob- 
vious from part of the content of 
this book that some of the most 
attractive images and turns of 
style in Pavanne were perhaps ini- 
tially stirred in Roberts' mind by a 
familiarity with Turner's later 
paintings, and a major charac- 
terization is by synthesis from 
Turner's life. 

For another thing, it’s possible 
to see from this book and Pavanne 
that he has a fixed fondness for 
writing typographical counter- 
point the kind of thing in which a 
central event unfolds before our 
eyes in Roman while a chorus com- 
ments on it in Italic. 

And as an offhand comment. 
I'd assume that Roberts is having 
the problem that many writers 
meet when faced with their first few 
novels; a resort to episodic tech- 
nique usually reflects a mistaken 
conviction that there is something 
about writing a novel that takes 
some sort of major regearing of 
the creative mechanism. Not feel- 
ing such a major change within 
himself, the writer who neverthe- 



114 



GALAXY 




less wants to bring out a book pro- 
duces it as a collection of short 
stories or as an imitation of a 
collection of short stories. 

Pavanne , which did originally 
appear as a series, couldn’t help be- 
ing that way. This one, I suspect, 
can be called Roberts' first 
“deliberate" novel, and for a first 
novel, it's pretty impressive. 

However, he’s going to be in 
trouble if his first all-of-a-piece 
book, which may be his next one, 
partakes of the thickly detailed 
prose technique which does so 
much to slow down the opening 
third of The Inner Wheel, and of 
the fever-dream chiaroscuro 
montages of the final third. These 
are techniques which are much 
easier to apply to short stories and 
novelettes than they are to cohesive 
novels, unless you are that inter- 
ested in careful prose workings 
that you don't care how few people 
can maintain their patience long 
enough to finish your book. 



F INALLY we run into a little 
problem with logic in this 
particular story. The gestalt 
minds, it seems, find it necessary to 
preserve world sanity by physi- 
cally dismantling the British 
defense establishment. They are 
depicted as doing this out of the 
highest idealistic motives. There's 
a half-convincing substory about 
a normal human being who acts as 
their go-between with the “nor- 



mal” world. Although at no time 
does Roberts convince me that this 
character is actually necessary to 
the workings of the gestalt minds' 
plans, he does provide some scenes 
which are effective to the exact de- 
gree that they resemble similar se- 
quences in 1984. (He also provides 
one-half of a really effective love 
story in connection with a female 
character, many of whose actions 
are inconsistent with that same 
character as portrayed in the mid- 
dle third of the book). 

The thing that boggles the mind 
is that it’s not until after the 
idealistic gestalt minds have dis- 
mantled the British defense 
establishment that they have any 
contact at all with similar (and 
presumably- similarly idealistic) 
minds in Europe. At no point in 
this book are they shown making 
contact with similar minds in the 
Western hemisphere or in Asia. In 
other words, the noble deeds 
portrayed here consist of a 
unilateral stripping away of all 
physical protection from the 
“normal” population of the 
British Isles by a group which is 
not capable of substituting any 
more effective protection, in the 
event all the other power groups in 
the world are not ready to lay down 
their arms just as soon as the Eng- 
lish do. 

This strikes me as a pretty 
dubious way of assuming one’s 
responsibilities as a superbeing. 
Given the logical frailties of the 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



115 




“normal’" human, il implies that 
the supermind is perfectly ready 
to put up with the undetermined 
possibility of World War 111 , since 
it can presumably protect itself, 
and has the equipment necessary 
to reclaim whatever rubble re- 
mains from the result of removing 
one key block from an elaborate 
system of checks and balances. 
Frankly, I'm not crazy about that 
idea, and 1 would think it's a 
proper demand on a writer to ask 
him to put something in there to 
allay my fears for my own skin, me 
being one of several people totally 
lacking in psionic abilities. 

So, as I was saying, this is not as 
good a book as Pavanne , and I was 
implying, its faults are large 
versions of the small traits of 
Pavanne. From a didactic point of 
view, what this means is that in my 
opinion Roberts has certain firmly 
accustomed habits of thought and 
certain set approaches to story 
problems, which he ought to spend 
a littre more lime analyzing for 
their various strengths and weak- 
nesses. 

On the other hand, and I think 
the stronger hand, a writer with 
definite approaches and a definite 
armamentarium of techniques at 
this stage in his career is a writer 
with fortunate characteristics. 
Furthermore, a writer as funda- 
mentally talented as Roberts is 
probably in a position to teach the 
rules-makers more than they could 
teach him. 



But in terms of the writer on one 
hand and the rules-makers on the 
other, this particular book is a 
book for both sides to learn from. 
To read for pure pleasure, it's not 
so useful. 



J AMES WHITE'S All Judgment 
Fled (Ballantine #02016.2.095, 
95c) is a book that sounds much 
better in the describing of it than 
in the reading. 

The story concerns itself with 
the crews of two space capsules 
sent to investigate a huge alien 
starship which has suddenly shown 
up on the fringes of the Solar 
System and gone into orbit 
around the Sun without either 
communicating or attempting to 
reply to any Terreslial communica- 
tions. The ship just hangs there, 
twelve million miles out beyond 
the orbit of Mars, impressing the 
daylights out of everybody and 
preserving an enigmatic aspect. 
The six men sent to investigate it 
at a fantastic expenditure of ef- 
fort actually represent the utmost 
the human race has ever been able 
to achieve in the way of space 
travel. Feeling very much like 
loin-clothed natives in a pair of 
dugout canoes, they come 
paddling up to the alien visitor and 
begin trying to solve the series of 
problems which confront them. 

Successively, they work their 
way into the ship, encounter 
voracious alien creatures which

may or may nol be intelligent, 
and, ultimately, nol only solve this 
problem in a satisfactory and 
heartening manner, but come very 
near to justifying the effort the 
reader has had to pul into wading 
through While's storytelling tech- 
nique. 

That technique is not only even 
more verbose than mine here, it has 
the serious failing of having 
crucial events occur either offstage 
or in curiously crippled form. 

What I mean by that last is that 
although White repeatedly demon- 
strates an ability to describe a 
scene in a fully rounded manner, 
so that you can see the people 
moving in full color, hear their 
voices, grip them with your fingers, 
smell them, and I guess even taste 
them, quite often when the chips 
are down, and the storyteller 
should be at the top of his form. 
White will suddenly shut off the 
sound, or the sight, or, as 1 said 
above, will actually dodge writing 
the scene entirely and simply refer 
to it as having occurred. 

Diagnosing writers at a distance 
is a mugs’ game, but I’ll take a stab 
at it for the sake of While's many- 
attractive gifts: I suspect that he 
generates so much tension within 
himself while writing a book that 
he literally cannot bear to come to 
grips with crucial scenes. If so if 
so -there are a couple of ways of 
getting around this, particularly 
once you recognize the problem, 
and I sincerely hope he does. 



O KAY. We all know I’m a Poul 
Anderson fan. 

Therefore, we can imagine the 
pleasure with which I greeted the 
appearance of Satan’s World 
(Lancer Books 74698-075. 75c) a 
Nicholas van Rijn-David Falkayn 
story which, as it happens. I had 
nol read before. 

Down the pike I merrily went, 
following the adventures of David 
and Nicholas, Chee Lan, Adzel, 
and Muddlehead, ripping down 
and building up the history of man 
for the greater glory and profit, 
naturally, of Solar Spice and Li- 
quors, Inc. 

Unfortunately, the farther along 
you get into the book, the more 
tired either you or Anderson be- 
come; from what started out as a 
nice, crisp story about interstellar 
skullduggery, a kidnaping, and 
an assault on a moon fortress by 
Adzel the six-limbed Saurian, with 
a cannon strapped to his back, and 
all kinds of goodies like that, this 
gradually becomes a series of 
scenes more or less individually 
attractive, but only more or less 
connected to the front half of the 
book. Anderson’s claim to me is 
not that of a man who delivers one 
hundred percent of the goods 
every time, but of a man who in a 
vast body of work delivers a hefty 
percentage of the goods gratify- 
ingly often. 

This time, he didn’t do it. 

That’s a shame because he 
started out quite nicely. ★

I 

GREG BEN FORD H1HE day started well enough, 

1 anyway. 

“So we ean see that if we use this 
term 

A light went on above the door 
and blinked insistently . 

The room was filled with the 
clicking of recorders going into 
rapid rewind and the scraping of 
desks being maneuvered in pre- 
paration lor the dash. Should 1 try 
to finish the sentence? 

1 turned to look at the class. 
They gave me an open-eyed, ex- 




pectanl look like a bunch of Class 
Two Norms. 

"Dismissed.” I switched off the 
AutoWrite and the equations dis- 
appeared from the Viewall. a 
signal for the wholesale desertion 
of things academic. If anything, 
Dr. Fredrick Black is a realist. 

1 picked up my lecture notes and 
followed my nine-o'clock class out 
the corridor. It didn't make any 
difference whether 1 finished the 
sentence, anyway; they didn't 
learn from lectures. Far easier to 
plug into a Wink-Cram treatment 
every night and sop up the real 
juice of your courses directly into 
the subconscious. If it weren't for 
the limit on the number of cuts 
they could take nobody would be 
here at all. 

Down at the end of the corridor, 
deep in the throng, I could see Win- 
ters coming my way. I was stuck 
behind an obese student who was 
chuckling over a mistake he'd 
found in a physics textbook. He 
had a laugh that sounded like 
someone beating an inflated bag- 
pipe with a stick. 

Fat Boy moved away, though, 
accompanied by a girl who made 
a practice of coming in at con- 
sultation periods and badgering 
me with ill-formed questions. Both 
frowned at me, thinking Fd been 
eavesdropping. They assumed 
the air of discovered insurgents, 
potential conspirators in the 
Sexual Revolution in Our Col- 
leges that one reads about in wom- 



en's magazines but never finds on 
campus, and snipped away. 

Out of the maelstrom of loiter- 
ing undergraduates struggled 
George Winters, graduate stu- 
dent extraordinary. He had 
brown eyes and a quiet, competent 
look about him. 

"We've got it," he said. 

“What?" And then 1 remem- 
bered: the phonon modulator. 

"I fooled around with it last 
night and got the efficiency up two 
orders of magnitude. It wasn't a 
fundamental problem at all we 
just weren't working at the right 
part of the plasma spectrum." 

"Quiet,” I said, but 1 didn't 
think anyone streaming past had 
heard. 1 noticed a passing coed 
with a singularly improbable 
construction. “Come on.” 

The crowds are getting worse 
every year. I dug an elbow into an 
obstructing undergraduate and 
made for the downramp. The coed 
wiggled out of sight, trailed by a 
worried crowd of engineering 
students specializing in suspen- 
sion bridges. 

We were caught in a class change 
and the ramps were clogged. 
Someone pressed against my 
shoulder and whispered, “Got the 
computer cross matrix lor the Bio 
Four-nineteen exam this after- 
noon. Straight goods, guaranteed.” 
I gave him a shocked look and he 
recognized my faculty badge and 
got lost fast. I could have collared 
him but I figured anybody who

GALAXY 




was stupid enough to buy a bogus 
program deserved it. 

The noise receded and the air 
chilled slightly as we worked our 
way into the bowels of the build- 
ing. At these depths only graduate 
students and occasionally the 
bigger fish, postdoctoral fellows, 
were to be seen. 

The laboratory, in the fourth 
sub-basement, was a fluorescent 
jungle, a riot of invention in a cell 
of tiled, Spartan logic. I tripped 
over a cable near the door and 
danced out of the way of a rig with 
its entrails scattered. Not that the 
mess mattered. A clean lab is the 
one with nothing happening in it. 

S OME other students were sup- 
posed to share the lab but the re- 
mains of their equipment were 
cowering in the corners. They 
didn't understand Winters; he'd 
switched fields, worked his way up 
from a Norm status and wasn't a 
sixteen-year-old scientific maniac, 
so of course they didn't like him. 

I motioned Winters to lock the 
door. 

“Check for bugs?" 1 asked. 

“All clear this morning. 1 found 
one early this week made up like 
a light switch, even had a ten-shot 
photoflash focused on the equip- 
ment in case they wanted a visual 
check- but I think it was just an 
ordinary monitor from the Inter- 
disciplinary Council for Allied Sci- 
ences." 

I nodded. The council used hid- 



den mikes to keep up on what was 
going on in the department, but 
they couldn't use it as scoop mate- 
rial. They were mostly Life 
Sciences people, anyway. And a 
biologist wouldn't understand 
what a physicist was doing even if 
he got hold of the council's tapes. 

“So it finally worked?" 1 said 
happily, security matters out of 
the way. 

"Watch the sample." 

Winters walked over to the 
control panel sealed among the 
mountains of electronics and 
Hipped on the power. 1 looked at 
the cube of ceramic mounted on 
braces. 

There was a vicious blue Hash 
and a circuit breaker popped 
front overload. I blinked and 
looked again. 

The sample was gone. No 
smoke, no noise, no Hollywood ef- 
fects. Just gone. There was a small 
pile of dust under the braces. 

"1 don't believe it," I said, 
believing it. “We thought we'd get 
a little synchronous vibration, 
far up in the band spectrum, but 
this 

A feeling, like Maxwell-writing- 
down-his-equations, Einstein-and- 
the-perihelion-of-Mercury, ran 
through me. 

"I don't believe it either." 
Winters grinned. “But it works." 

"It's set up the way I outlined?" 
I said, fingers tripping lightly 
from amplifier to microwave tun- 
nel to modulator and onward, 

121 



BUTTHE SECRETSITS 




checking, memorizing. It wouldn't 
do to leave the circuitry intact in 
the lab, where a random light tube 
dropped down the ventilators could 
get a snap. 

“Perfectly. " Winters replied. 
"I'd been sweeping through the 
optical and microwave spectrum, 
trying to pick up the right plasmon 
resonance. About an hour ago the 
crystal started to show longitud- 
inal phonon emission in the lower 
portion of the energy band, tut 
you were in class so I tried to tune 
it in better on my own. The third 
harmonic of one of those helicon 
instabilities showed up on our 
equipment and then” 

“And then the phonons went 
into the far nonlinear.” 1 was try- 
ing not to dance around the ap- 
paratus. 

The idea was simple, but we'd 
been trying for over a year to 
make it work. Every solid has 
specific patterns of vibration — nor- 
mal modes- that in usual circum- 
stances are ordinary, linear, well- 
behaved oscillations. But if energy 
is introduced into a sample in just 
the right way the normal modes 
can be driven, and the solid will 
absorb the energy into its lattice. 
Add enough — and there’s the 
trick— and the lattice can’t take it 
any longer. It gets driven com- 
pletely off the range of plasmon 
energies that permit the stable 
formation of a metallic solid. The 
sample disintegrates. 

"Fine, fine,” I said and made a 



few notes on the settings of the 
monitors. I looked into the glass 
cover of a meter and saw my own 
face staring back at me. This was 
going to complicate my status in 
the physics department. I knew . 

I noticed my hands were sweat- 
ing. "Let me have a look at the re- 
cording traces," 1 mumbled, 
moving over to the other side of 
the lab. 

“For a shot in the dark, then, 
we're pretty accurate," 1 said, 
talking to cover my uneasiness, 
"We could have tried for years and 
never hit a thing. The theory be- 
hind nonlinear resonances in 
solids is just starling to hit the 
journals now and there hasn't been 
anything done experimentally 
yet. We've got a whole new field.” 

Half self-mocking and half not. 
Winters and 1 shook hands. The 
more 1 talked the better 1 felt. 
Statistically, things like this just 
don't fall into your lap every day. 
Or every lifetime. 

W F TORE down part of the cir- 
cuitry and rewired it in what 
seemed like equivalent ways, try- 
ing to find out the easiest tech- 
nique for attaching current inputs. 
Sometimes the effect would 
weaken and eventually damp out. 
But its operating range was broad 
and convenient for most of the 
equipment we had; given the time, 
we could gel a gold mine of data. 
We went to work.

I kept extensive notes in my own 
shorthand to throw off easy de- 
coding; you can have all the crypto- 
graphic computers of the NATO- 
SAO-ANRAD complex behind 
you. but if you can't read the notes 
you've stolen, they're worthless. 

And of course 1 didn't use one of 
the standard codes they teach you 
in the lab courses. It's good scien- 
tific procedure to code, but the 
memory-mesh system the in- 
structors hand out is too simple. 
Any six-year-old could split it open 
like a ripe watermelon, with a 
computer link to help him through 
the algebra. 

But now 1 had a chance to do 
some pure physics in a debugged 
lab and I lost track of lime. Lunch 
came. I climbed up out of the pit 
of professional isolation we'd dug 
ourselves into and told Winters to 
go home he deserved a rest. The 
preliminary work was finished 
and 1 wanted to do some thinking. 

1 picked up the papers with crude 
schematics sketched on them, put 
a double seal on the lab and caught 
the next ramp up. thinking of 
erudite titles with I . Black and G. 
Winters printed firmly under- 
neath. 

I stopped at the tenth lloor and 
found the nearest InSlal station. 
There was a line outside, mostly 
advanced graduate students and 
technicans sending in extra copies 
of their weekly reports on the off 
chance the Sil'tsystem would find 
some worthwhile measurements 



in their data and make a short 
article out of them. 

Stupid. If they hit it lucky not 
many did it meant a quick PhD 
and a good job. But it was blind. 
No method. In a lew years on the 
outside they'd fall behind in pro- 
motions and stop getting equip- 
ment grants, begin to gel rattled 
and blow a research deadline on a 
big contract. They'd go back down 
like a grand piano in a ten-gee 
field, then tail off just above Norm 
rank. As 1 said, stupid. 

It came my turn and 1 already 
had my abstract written out in my 
head. I punched in PROGRAM 
PRIORCLA1M and thumbed in 
the necessary credits for Top 
Journal status. If the censor cir- 
cuits thought it was good enough 
I'd make Phys Rev it had been 
Physical Review when I was an 
undergraduate but beyond that 
I didn't know who'd be inter- 
ested. Defense, certainly, and 
maybe NASA. 1 filed a request 
for anonymous sponsorship of 
publication costs in case any- 
body wanted to pick up the tab. 

C OMING out of the booth, I met 
Randy Davis. 

“Socking in another one, Fred.’" 
he said, angling to get a look at the 
notes I had in my hand. I stuffed 
them hastily into my pocket. 

“No, just monitoring a re- 
ference to be sure he doesn't turn in 
anything without its getting into 
the journals," I said. 



BUT THE SECRETSITS

“Know what you mean. Some of 
these guys pile up a dozen papers 
in your field without putting a 
word into print. It's all copy- 
righted and on tape, so nobody 
can howl when he dumps all of 
them into the literature and wipes 
out six months of your work." 
Randy's raisin face looked more 
serious, his weak mouth attempt- 
ing a scowl, but the effect didn't 
quite come off. "We ought to have 
an Ethic passed about it." 

1 grinned; I was so happy I 
wasn't even bothered by his try- 
ing to drop a microbug shaped like 
a coat button into my pocket. 
“Now Randy, you know the 
Academic Freedom and License 
Committee has taken it up be- 
fore. If you're not willing to spend 
the money on searching the 
PRIORCLAIM tapes, you don't 
have the right spirit for research. 
Gelling thejournals isn't enough.” 

He fidgeted with the button a 
moment longer as we walked back 
toward the ramp and finally 
palmed it out of sight. “Well, I 
needn’t worry. I haven't got any- 
thing big going on right now. I 
look a long vacation four days 
and helped my parents move stuff 
by suborbital down to Australia." 

“Oh?" 1 tried to look inter- 
ested. “They're retiring?" 

“Sure. Dad's forty-seven, two 
years over maximum already. 
Had two of his big projects turned 
down in a row and bang he was 
out on the street." 



"Too bad." 

“He doesn't mind. He knew he 
was giving out and the arthritis was 
coming back on him. I don't think 
either of them will last loo long, 
even down there in the desert 
where it's peaceful. They've both 
been in technical development. 
The nerves will only take so much 
of that." 

I nodded without saying 
anything, thinking about my re- 
search. We were coming to my 
floor so I waved goodbye and got 
off. My finger watch said five 
minutes had elapsed since my pro- 
gram went in, so 1 went over to the 
printer at the end of the hall and 
dialed in for my Phys Rev. 

I caught my name in a quick 
scan of the contents and thumbed 
in for ten more reprints. The 
writeup was standard, just the 
9000- word- vocabulary Semanlar- 
ile job, but you could tell even the 
computer's discretionary sub- 
program thought it was important. 

It was a quick, clean job. If we 
played it right there was a lot more 
meal to be carved out before the 
pack caught up with us. And catch- 
ing up would take time; the Ethics 
only required a general des- 
cription lor establishment of a 
Priorclaim, and the Phys Rev 
article didn't really have enough 
specifics to be useful. It would 
take some searching to find out 
just what the hell we had done, and 
by then we'd be doing something 
else.

Some students were waiting 
outside my office in case the 
green consultation light went out. 

I ducked in before they could give 
me the full mournful look and 
punched the Autosec over to re- 
jection for any visitors less than 
Einstein status. 

1 could let the physics go for a 
few hours; the politics were going 
to give me more trouble. Winters 
was my ace in the hole, and he'd 
come through. Until I got full 
tenure status, the department 
could take him away and cripple 
my research. 1 got out the staff 
roster and went through the names. 
Normally they were good, hard- 
working types, but . 

Professor Ruggles, say. Big lab, 
lots of students, fat A EC con- 
tract. He'd been pouring a few 
megabucks into the same area that 
1 was in and all he'd gotten was a 
couple of simple articles clogged 
with irrelevant data. 

Pretty smart, they would say, 
steal the idea from Ruggles and 
give it to one of his graduate stu- 
dents to cover up. 

Too glib, / always thought. And 
doesn't the committee to con- 
sider his tenure meet about this 
time ? 

The postdoc in the next office 
put on a leisure tape and the sound 
filtered through the ventilation 
grille. 1 could tell there were no 
instilled patterns, nothing on the 
subliminal tracks to learn; a waste 
of lime. It sounded like Bach. 



sharp and brisk, and made me feel 
as though 1 were being repeatedly 
hit on the head with a teaspoon. 

The best thing to do now was 
try to work through the theory I'd 
already developed on the effect, 
looking for other facets we could 
explore. The plasmon-phonon 
coupling was tricky; there might 
be aspects I had not considered. 

I sal down at my desk, dialed my 
chair to medium rigid, and started 
to work. 

II 

T HE rest of the afternoon slid by, 
mingled with the raw crunch of 
wadded papers as 1 threw them 
away. There were a few things we 
could look for that werejusl on the 
verge of observability. I'd have to 
tell Winters about them and set up 
a program to search them out. 

I watched the sun creep up the 
wall, discovering new facets of 
the Cheer-O-Tile. Leaves rustled 
outside my window, but I 
couldn't hear them over the air 
conditioning. 

1 was interrupted by the Auto- 
Sec inquiring if 1 wished to admit 
visitors now that the normal con- 
sultation period was past. I must 
have nodded because Randy's 
voice came over the departmental 
intercom. 

"Hey. don't you ever quit?" 
"Didn't know what time it was." 

I glanced at my desk clock. Seven 
o'clock, already. 



BUTTHE SECRETSITS

“I’m going home. Want to 
come'?'' 

“Okay." 

I cut off and locked my notes 
into the desk. 

Randy met me on the ramp and 
we checked out through the auto- 
matic guard at the front door. 
Then down the steps into the quad, 
a chill fall breeze whipping 
through the close-packed build- 
ings. 

We cut across on a faculty ramp 
to save time, through one of the 
arched entranceways to the cam- 
pus, with just a nominal visual 
check of our cards. The purple 
neon Multiversity sign Hashed out. 

ONLY THOSE WHO TAKE LEI- 
SURELY WHAT THE PEOPLE 
OF THE WORLD ARE BUSY 
ABOUT CAN BE BUSY ABOUT 
WHAT THE PEOPLE OF THE 
WORLD TAKE LEISURELY. 

There was a little jingle to go 
with it, but the audio part was shut 
off after class hours. 

No stars penetrated the muddy 
smog dome over us. From the 
other side of the campus I could 
hear soft rumbles of a young 
Beethoven rolling into his second 
symphony -the open air concerts. 
How long had it been since 1 at- 
tended one? 

When I'd come here as an un- 
dergraduate, there was lime. I 
read novels, went to art galleries. 
All that had gradually slipped 



away until I found myself reading 
biographies of prominent scientists 
instead, -or doing background 
studies in areas related to my own. 

And yet, I didn't have the feel- 
ing that I was a drudge. Such a 
level of work was normal here and 
I had come to accept it. 

Maybe I could change all that, 
once 1 got current business out of 
the way. 

We caught the tube. Randy and I 
lived just a few stops down, safely 
inside the Multiversity com- 
munity. .It wasn't like Berkeley, 
Norms and university personnel 
scrambled up together. How they 
ever got any work done there. I 
don't know. 

As the lube car pulled away 
Randy turned the conversation 
back to my research. 

“I noticed you didn't give any of 
the important specs on your ap- 
paratus in Rhys Rev today," he 
said. 

I made what I hoped was a wry 
grin. “Until the Review Board de- 
mands it for authentication, I'm 
keeping everything under my hat." 

"It sounds like a good solid 
advance to me. A little pushing 
and wrangling and you might even 
get the board to declare it a Break- 
through." Randy looked at me out 
of the sides of his eyes. I continued 
to study the scenery zipping by. 

“And who might be doing the 
wrangling?" 

“Oh, anybody with the pro- 
fessional status could do it," he 



126 



GALAXY 




said too casually. "He'd have to be 
of higher rank than you, though." 

"Somebody like Ruggles?" I 
said. 

"That might not be a bad choice, 
yes." 



I WONDERED how Ruggles 
had been able to pull the strings 
on this one so fast. Hell, it hadn't 
been more than a few hours. 

“What if 1 have some other 
choice? Or don’t choose at all?" 

Randy frowned. “It’s your 
professional obligation." 

I didn't reply. 

"Come on," he chided. “You 
aren’t going to hog this all lor 
yourself, are you?" 

“You forgot Winters." 

"Okay, and Winters. Rut if a 
younger staff member stumbles 
on something this big he shares 
it with the older members of the 
faculty. They have the experience 
to lead him down the right paths in 
the work that follows. He doesn’t 
keep it for himself." 

“Could it be that they want to 
keep a hand in anything new that 
comes up, because if they didn't it 
would* be pretty clear that they 
didn’t have any more ideas them- 
selves?" 

"We all pull together. Anything 
else would be like what goes on in 
the Normzones. It’s the same 
principle that produced the divided 
society in the first place. Read C.P. 
Snow." 



"Wrong. Snow didn’t say any- 
thing like that." 

Randy shook his head. "He was 
the first to show that society had 
begun to split into segments that 
didn't communicate with each 
other and that the process was 
accelerating." 

.1 thought back over my 
memories of Snow, the courses in 
Pragmatic Philosophy I’d had, and 
the rest of it. “What you don’t gel 
over the three-D. Randy, is that 
old C.P. thought division was 
bad." 

"Bad? How can separation be 
bad’’ The future progress of the 
race depends on the scientific and 
managerial community's being 
able to function in freedom and 
isolation, without having to play 
footsie with the rabble. Without 
us they'd all starve to death in a 
week." 

“Probably so. But Snow came 
from a solid background in what 
they called the Humanities, and he 
thought things would go wrong if 
either group had control and 
didn't communicate with the 
other. The books he wrote were fic- 
tion, you know, not good honest 
fact. He wasn't just a scientist, he 
knew other things." 

"Whatever else he worked on 
didn’t last,” he said, thinking he’d 
made a point. But the bit about the 
books was almost new to me, too; 

1 hadn't remembered them for 
years. Now that 1 thought about it, 
all the talk about Snow's being a

127 




social scientist on a level above 
Marx and all the rest was just ri- 
diculous. 

"Still,” Randy went on, "I 
won’t deny that isolation has 
brought out the worst aspects of 
the Norms. You can see them 
loitering around the edges of the 
Multiversity, not doing any- 
thing, wearing sloppy clothes and 
sneering at people who do an 
honest day's work. And everybody 
knows about their women.” 

1 nodded and let him go on: “A 
few students last quarter goT in- 
volved with some Norm girls. Ad- 
ministration found out about it, 
of course, but by the time the cam- 
pus police got there the boys were 
beaten up and stripped naked. 
Hoodlums had painted "Stuff 
Your Slide Rule” all over them in 
indelible ink. The police had to 
call for a cruising armored car to 
get them all out safely.” 

I laughed but I could see from 
Randy's tight lips that I was sup- 
posed to lake a lesson from a hor- 
rible example. 

"If you heed my advice then. 
Frank, you’ll do the right thing by 
the department. We owe it to the 
Multiversity, you and I. We’ve got 
to support the Multiversity and 
the Government or the Norms will 
get into power and we’ll all go 
down the drain.” 

1 looked out at the darkened 
buildings. We were almost at my 
stop. 

“It's your duty,” he said. “Any- 



thing less than what's right will get 
you into trouble. And after all, 
when you're a senior staff mem- 
ber you'll get the benefits of other 
people’s work, too.” 

“But that's just the smacker,” I 
pointed out. “That wouldn't be my 
work.” 

“Just 

“Y 'know, sometimes I can 
believe those Norms who say the 
Great Twentieth Century Scien- 
tific Revolution is running out of 
steam,” I said. “There’s got to be 
some reason for all this backbit- 
ing.” 

He was getting irritated. 
“You're acting like a coward,” he 
said. 

“I'm not acting," 1 said and got 
off at my stop. 

I N THE morning 1 rose earlier 
than usual. I had stayed up late 
studying and planning and I 
couldn't seem to get the grit out of 
my eyes. I reached across the small 
kitchenette table and switched on 
the morning 3D. A news brief. 

“New rioting and violence in the 
Norm zones." The announcer 
shot out the words machine-gun 
style. “Motorcycle gangs killed 
three, injured forty today in fight- 
ing that followed the monthly 
announcement of Multiversity 
scholarship winners." The screen 
showed a tall, athletic young man 
in a leather jacket beating an 
anemic youth with glasses. “Dis- 
gruntled applicants for the posi- 



128 



GALAXY 




tions were sel upon by hoodlums 
shouting Too good for us, four- 
eyes?' and violence flared." 

The announcer looked directly at 
the camera with his serious, all- 
knowing smile. He was a young 
man, suavely confident, prob- 
ably a public control specialist 
with 99-plus rank in all his exams. 
In a plain gray suit he looked not 
as much an adult as an overgrown 
child. 

He opened his mouth and I cut 
him off. His image collapsed and 1 
leered maliciously back at him as 
he died. I had an extra cup of 
Perk-O-Caf (“Extra caffein to 
keep your nerves in that peak con- 
dition!”) and started for the phys- 
ics department. On the way over, 
ignoring the crowds, 1 reviewed 
the' internal structure of the de- 
partment, searching for weak- 
nesses, probing, trying to guess 
what would come next. 

My lower-division lecture 
started off at an even pace, but 
after ten minutes I began stum- 
bling through my notes and losing 
track of what I wanted to say. I 
realized it wasn't going over. 
Ruggles kept popping into my 
stream of consciousness. Excus- 
ing class halfway through the lec- 
ture isn't good practice it gives 
you a reputation for being erratic 
and overemotional but it's bet- 
ter than starting to talk to your- 
self with thirty people watching. 1 
let them go. 

The students were milling 



around in the hall, confused by the 
sudden windfall of a whole hour, 
free of any harangue by a 
bourgeois lackey of the reaction- 
ary university. They quickly made 
a path for me, probably afraid 
that if frustrated in my attempt to 
get away I would leap upon them 
with mad ravings and run amok 
down the hall. I'd forgotten to 
shave that morning and was a lit- 
tle red-eyed from reading too 
much. The department chairman 
would hear of this, I was sure. 

“Black." 

I turned around to see Ruggles, a 
big man with unruly hair and a sad 
face, gliding down the ramp from 
his A EC-financed sanctuary like a 
fat angel from on high. 

Chalk dust lapped tenderly in 
the valleys formed by his pleated 
trousers. He gave me a look of 
equal parts injured trust and as- 
sured maliciousness, clamping his 
hands firmly behind him as if he 
somehow thought his back was go- 
ing to fall off. 

“Hear you've been doing some 
work related to what I'm study- 
ing,” he puffed at me. 

I smiled. 

“Winters ran across an effect 
we can't explain at the moment, 
but it's probably an anomaly." 

He raised bushy eyebrows. 

“You reported an accident to 
Phys Rev'V 

Trapped. "Uh 

“You know. I've put in a lot of 
time on these studies and a lot of

people are behind me. 1 think for 
the good of the department — " 
“You'll get all the information 
as soon as it’s ready. We're just at 
the beginning stages now.” 

B EFORE he could think of any- 
thing more to say I nodded and 
was gone, 200-meter dash high 
school champion three times in a 
row -out, past guard and down the 
stairs. 

Hell . I could snuggle up to Rug- 
gles, of course, let him in at the be- 
ginning and have his horde of grad- 
uate siudents tramp through the 
problem. 

And that's what they'd do. Stay 
in the lab twenty hours a day, take 
every facet of the effect and run it 
remorselessly to earth. 

Give it a name. The X Effect. 
Pile up a mountain of papers. 
Push the A EC into renewing the 
contract. Get the department a 
larger appropriation, draw in 
more graduate students, maybe 
hold a regional conference here to 
advertise a little. Cut in everyone 
qualified for a little of the pie (Bio- 
chemical Studies Using The X Ef- 
fect), spread it around, gel kick- 
backs in return. 

Wouldn't want to antagonize 
anyone, Dr. Black . 

Professor Black . 

Chairman Black . 

You could wind up very com- 
fortably, if the X Effect held out 
that long. If it didn’t, Ruggles 
would gel something to weigh the 



scales a little more in his favor 
with the AEC. You might get a 
paper or two, not enough to do that 
much good. Maybe not enough to 
get tenure. 

Maybe not, Mr. Black . 

I slipped my Identcard hurried- 
ly into the slot outside the library 
and went into the periodical sec- 
tion. The brown metal racks that 
held the technical journals covered 
three floors, stiffly worded titles 
that encased thick shelves of com- 
puterese. And those were only the 
most important printouts; the 
lesser ones were on tape. 

An impressive view, if only one 
couldn't read. 

I made a show of looking up 
some back references on non- 
linear resonances, Jacobean 
matrices and other random sub- 
jects, and then punched for the 
latest printout on references to 
my work. The public computer 
software was slower, since it had a 
lower priority rating for shared- 
lime readout from the computer's 
library, but it was also untrace- 
able. No one could find out if I'd 
checked. 

I got the tapes on standby check- 
out and found a booth. The one I 
wanted was a half-inch in radius. I 
found a few routine queries for 
any future work from backwater 
colleges, some crossreference 
notes written by the computer 
and one request for more data 
from a Federal agency I didn't 
know. They were identified only by 



130 



GALAXY 




a long string ol' letters and num- 
bers. 

Good. No major competitors, as 
yet. 

When my lime was up I gave the 
tapes back to a cruising librarian 
cart so no one would notice who 
returned them and went back to 
the physics department. 

There was a line outside my 
door again, but this time not all 
students. 

Ill 

WfTAHN Institute," a tall, beak- 
nosed man said abruptly 
when I let him in. "Want to talk 
about your work." 

He sat down without being in- 
vited and pulled a lot of forms out 
of a thick briefcase. 

"Your article was processed and 
projected by our computer, the 
best on this continent. It tells us 
the process of disintegration you 
mention or imply in your 
article could have important mili- 
tary applications." 

“I hadn’t reali/cd that. And the 
article didn't imply anything 
about military uses." 

"The machine caught it. You 
can see it for yourself with a little 
careful reading." 

"Don’t believe everything your 
machine tells you.” 

“That's an anlisemantic re- 
mark. Computers can work out 
the implications of the written 
word better than any single hu- 



man." His fingers were plucking 
at the cuffs of the severe black suit 
he wore. “It may become possible 
to, say, attach leads lor micro- 
wave pulsers to large objects and 
destroy them completely with 
your techniques." 

I nodded. His beak nose weaved 
back and forth with hypnotic ef- 
fect. 

I was still nodding an hour later 
when I got rid of him. Yes, the In- 
stitute would gel regular reports 
and yes, of course I'd let their tech- 
nicians into the lab to set up their 
rigs and certainly I realized the 
national defense was at stake and 
I wouldn't want to impede . 

The next man was short and fat 
and llicked cigarette ashes around 
him like a nervous acolyte scatter- 
ing incense. 

“Dr. Black, sir, I'm a tech- 
helper over in biomed and I heard 
about your Breakthrough over 
here. The contract that hired me 
isn't very big and a few of us were 
thinking the other day about the 
fact that it probably won't be re- 
newed 

His voice strangled off and the 
little man looked uncomfortable. 

“You'd like to work on my pro- 
ject?" 

"I could work nights," he 
blurted out. "Keep my old job, 
learn your techniques on my own 
time, without costing your con- 
tract a thing." 

"No," I started to say, "I don't 
th " 



BUTTHE SECRETSITS

"But m go on NoSleep! I'll 
spend all my time off the job on 
your project." 

It took me fifteen minutes to get 
rid of that one. If I took on one 
the others would be after me, all 
the second-rate people caught in 
dead projects in the backwaters 
of research. 

The rest of the line got the axe; 
I'd had enough for one day. 

Winters had been working hard; 
I found him in the lab. rear- 
ranging equipment. 

"I saw the article.” He grinned. 
"Fast work." 

He turned away and started ex- 
plaining a new experimental con- 
figuration he'd thought out and I 
breathed an inaudible sigh of re- 
lief. He didn't question my omis- 
sion of his name from the article; 
sometimes it takes graduates a 
while to get used to that. But a 
faculty member needs every pub- 
lication point he can get, right 
down to the fractions alloted for 
every time your name appears in a 
footnote. 

But then I thought, why? Why 
did I run it with only my name? 
Winters did as much as I, even if 
he was a graduate student. With 
the rest of the department trying 
to steal everything I had, what was 
I doing pulling the same scheme 
on Winters? 

The thought bothered me. I 
shelved it and tried to pay atten- 
tion to what Winters was telling 
me. 



His new rig was an improve- 
ment on the one I'd designed, but I 
would've made the same changes if 
I'd had the lime. Damned polities 
was getting between me and my 
work again. It always did just 
after you got results. 

I spent a lew pleasant hours run- 
ning tests and trying to narrow 
down the areas in which the reson- 
ance occured, thumbing dials and 
squinting into crowded equip- 
ment chassis, happy to get away 
from the world. Winters was a 
good researcher and getting bet- 
ter. He worked with the care and 
attention to detail I remembered 
from my days as a grad student, 
unlike the frantic scramble of the 
scientific monks most students 
were becoming. 

A N URGENT signal from my 
AutoSec searched me out over 
the lab intercom and 1 broke off 
work. I could depend on Winters 
to carry on with reasonable 
ability, so the interruption wasn't 
so bad. 

Randy caught me on the 
up ramp. 

"Say, you know anything about 
Kowalski at Mid western. 1 he in- 
quired. 

I shook my head, wondering 
what this was about. A new and an 
elaborate play to get me into the 
clutches of Ruggles? 

"Got a recommendation from 
him on a student who’s applied to 
us. Kowalski gives him a pretty 



132 



GALAXY 




good writeup, but alter that cross 
we pulled on him last year I don't 
know. " 

"Cross?” 

"We had a had student and 
Kowalski was looking lor some- 
body to fill an open slot in his 
team. The department worked it 
so everyone in Kowalski's field 
wrote good letters backing up the 
student's application and the peo- 
ple at Midwestern went lor it. 
They're a little slow back there. 
Our boy got the slot and by the 
lime Kowalski caught on he'd 
wasted months trying to train a 
useless deadhead.” 

"Oh.” I said. It was a new one 
on me. 

"So I guess we'll have to turn 
down anybody applying from 
Midwestern for a while until this 
blows over. Tough, but it s a nec- 
fessary move. Life is full of these 
unpleasant decisions, boy.” 

Departmental politics always 
seemed to move people to phil- 
osophy. 1 ignored the hint and 
made for my office. 

The first call was from the Kahn 
Institute. "Dr. Black'.’" asked a 
pretty secretary. "We wanted to 
know your preference in ghosl- 
scripters for your project pro- 
posal.” 

"What'.’ I'll write my own.” 

The pretty face frowned. "I'm 
afraid that's quite impossible, sir. 
With a major undertaking like 
this we want a first rank job done 
on any budget proposals, outlines 



of future expectations and so 
forth. We couldn’t leave it up to an 
amateur.” 

She smiled uncertainly at me. 
Alter a moment 1 nodded. "Okay. 
Just let me see it before it goes 
out.” I thumbed off and didn't 
have time to think before another 
image formed. 

"Dr. Black.” Ruggles beamed 
out at me. being as formal as poss- 
ible. "1 must in f o r m y o u o f a 
decision made by the department 
chairman and myself regarding 
y our recent discoveries.” 

"By you and the chairman? 
What about the rest of the depart- 
ment?" 

lie gave me a manic grin. "We 
want to keep this a private mat- 
ter. We're sure the senior mem- 
bers would support us. so there's 
no reason to bring it into a lull 
session of the department. " 

fie was probably right, but they 
were still railroading me. 

"frankly, we are all somewhat 
surprised at your attitude. Your 
knowledge of professional stan- 
dards of behavior certainly 
should tell you that we 

"The hell with that. What do you 
want'.’” 

Ruggles paled visibly. Every- 
body seemed to think I should 
treat the full professors as elder 
gods, but I was getting fed up. 
Ruggles looked inquiringly off 
camera, then back at me. 

"If you won't give us the back- 
ground on your work - Tin afraid

it will be necessary for the depart- 
ment to take it from you. I've put 
up with this long enough." 

" You've pul up 

"Yes, and don't think others 
don't agree with me." 

"Ah, you have accomplices, 
then?" 

"You are behaving like an in- 
grate. This department has given 
you every opportunity 

"Stuff it, Ruggles. You're a 
stupid son of a bitch or you 
wouldn't be in this situation." 

"You cheat. I'm going

dently whoever was off cam-

didn't want Ruggles to waste

tirades. 

Was everybody crazy.’ All I 
wanted to do was lake credit for 
my own work. I even had a guilty 
feeling about dropping Winters" 
name from the article, though that 
was standard practice. 

The phone rang again. I ignored 
it. 

A note on my desk reminded me 
of some paperwork connected 
with the Kahn Institute and gave a 
hierarchy of numbers I could call. 
A letter welcomed me to some- 
thing called the "Kahn family." I 
stuffed it into my pocket and 
locked up. 

I was surprised at the dusky 
symphony of closing doors and 
fading voices in the halls; I hadn't 



realized it was so late. Shadows in 
dark overcoats were slipping 
down the corridors and out, away, 
home. I strolled over to the Stu- 
dent Union. 

I ordered the Italian Special and 
the machine spat it out at me. 
"Warmed to stomach-pleasing de- 
light," the plastic pullolf seal re- 
assured me. 

It was a good choice. Nobody 
can eat spaghetti and have lime to 
be lonely it requires loo much 
attention. 

The bastards were going to get 
me; I could feel it with a dead, cold 
certainty. They could crush me 
without thinking about it, like a 
dreaming elephant rolling over in 
its sleep. And the hell of it was that 
1 had grown up in the poker game 
of the System, played by its rules, 
studied my cards diligent!), 
pocketed my winnings when they 
came and waited for the deal to 
come to me. Now it looked as 
though I wasn't going to get the 
deal or have a chance to change the 
rules. I was being cut out. The only 
thing I had on my side was that no- 
body could fight the System bel- 
ter than a man who saw it clearly. 
Ruggles didn't; he thought the 
rules of his bureaucracy were the 
laws of the universe. Still, I would 
need every point 1 could muster in 
my favor. 

Maybe 1 should have stayed in 
the lab and worked with Winters 
to get more background data on 
the effect. The work would have to 



134 



GALAXY 




be done sometime. But by the time 
it was finished the politics could 
finish me off. 

The only place where I felt com- 
fortable now was back in the lab. 

Back 

Something clicked. 

I stood up and left. 

I took the note from the Kahn 
Institute out of my pocket as I 
pushed through the steel-gray caf- 
eteria doors. Visiphone booths 
gleamed outside. 1 ducked into 
one. 

Even inside the booth I caught 
that faint odor of disinfectant and 
stale food that institutions always 
have. 1 grimaced, anticipating what 
was to come, and picked out the 
number of someone high up in the 
Institute. The code digits rattled 
and beeped happily in my ear. 

1 AM BLED slowly back to the 
lab, barely able to contain my 
anticipation. A crisp, cool evening 
welcomed me. A wind sang in my 
ears and cleared my mind. 

Winters was working late in the 
lab. He started to describe what he 
was doing but I told him to save it. 

I looked over the experiment for 
the last lime, savoring a touch of 
nostalgia for the years Ed worked 
on it. No matter what it came to, 
the work had been good. 

Then the mood was broken and 1 
started checking all the likely 
places: automatic eyes in the light 
fixtures, bugs taped under 
drawers, the rest. They hadrn’t 



missed a thing. Every one of the 
stock devices were there and prob- 
ably a lot more besides. When the 
physics department moves in with 
its special equipment, it can avoid 
detection if it wants to bother. 
Evidently Ruggles didn't think it 
necessary. 

He must have figured from the 
first that I would cross him. This 
gear couldn't have been planted 
without planning. 

The door buzzed. 

"Dr. Black.’" came over the 
audio. 

I opened the door and there they 
were. 

A Kahn Institute security squad 
was formed up outside. Their cap- 
lain stepped forward smartly and 
requested permission to search 
the lab. 1 gave it, stepped aside and 
watched his men at work. The 
beak-nosed guy was with them, but 
he didn't say much. They found 
more in two minutes that I had in 
ten. Winters stared as they pulled 
sensors out of unlikely places and 
piled them in the center of the 
floor. 

"How did they--" 

"You were concentrating on 
your work. Somebody probably 
slipped them in when you went out 
to lunch. You can’t be expected to 
keep up with this stuff all the 
time." 

"We've traced it, sir," one of the 
Institute guards called out. 

He was standing over a portable 
detector that operated on a

135 




resonant effect: send out signals at 
the right frequency and the auto- 
matic equimenl that ran the focus- 
ing for the electric eyes would 
interpret it as ordinary data. 
When the stuff at the other end 
decided the eye needed refocusing 
it would send instructions and our 
boys would gel a fix from that. 

The captain checked beak nose, 
rushed over to me, rattled off his 
official report and was gone. He 
took most of the squad with him up 
the ramp and left the rest to guard 
the lab. 

1 followed at a leisurely pace. 
Winters behind me. After all, 1 
knew where they were going. 

The captain had Ruggles in 
custody and was herding him out 
with two graduate students when 
we got there. The squad was 'con- 
fiscating the equipment that had 
been hastily set up in Ruggles' of- 
fice and everything was a colossal 
mess. 

"What does this mean, Black?" 
Ruggles shouted. The guards were 
treating him a little roughly and he 
was out of breath. 

"The Kahn people have got me 
on contract. Your snooping is 
illegal unless cleared with them." 

“They'll okay it. It’s the normal 
function of a department. If 
you'd just told us--" 

I looked at him blankly. “But 
you didn't tell me you were going 
to bug my lab. I agree the depart- 
ment can do it -but unless we're 
warned we'll have to treat your be- 



havior as a security violation." 

"Exactly." said beaknose. "I am 
afraid I will have to declare you 
under arrest. Professor Ruggles, 
and your students, until this mat- 
ter - " 

"Slop." We all stared down the 
hall, where blue-uniformed Multi- 
versity police were jumping off the 
ramp. 

"Ah," Ruggles said. "I thought 
you'd never get here." He turned to 
beaknose and smiled. "I called the 
police as soon as I heard some of 
the conversation my sensors 
picked up." 

A police sergeant trotted up, 
puffing. Everyone started to talk 
at once, with much gesturing of 
hands. The scene looked like a 
Parisian traffic accident. I dropped 
out of the conversation and just 
watched. 

"Wail a minute!" the police 
sergeant shouted. He turned to 
Ruggles, who was trying to make 
the guards let go. "If you've been 
arrested for breach of security by 
the Institute, there's nothing I 
can do about it." 

“That's right," I said, looking 
helpful. "Standing Multiversity 
orders don't permit interference 
with members of other security 
forces. If they arrest you, the 
Multiversity will have to go 
through regular channels to get you 
back." 

R UGGLES opened his mouth to 
say something stupid and I 



136 



GALAXY 




looked al the police sergeant. “But 
you, sir, are not completely with- 
out power." 

Beak nose was try ing to get 
everyone's attention, but we 
ignored him. 

“How do you mean?” the 
sergeant said. 

“You're on Multiversity prop- 
erty. A matter pertaining to secu- 
rity of staff members has come up 
and there are persons here who can 
supply some needed details. Under 
standard regs you can place them 
under protective custody until the 
matter is cleared up." 

The sergeant looked serious. 
“Ah, 1 see." 

Beak nose was plucking at my 
shoulder. The sergeant gestured to 
his men and they moved in' and 
grabbed beaknose by the arms. 

“You can't arrest a represent- 
ative of the Institute," he said. He 
looked aL the captain of the squad 
he had brought with him. “Gel 
these men away from me." 

The captain shrugged. "I can't. 
My orders don't permit 

“I don’t give a damn about your 
orders. Call off these lugs." 

“Now,” I said soothingly, “we 
can't go around violating rules just 
because you want to. We all have 
to pull together." 

“But an incident like this can 
place the whole project in 
jeopardy. If 1 have to explain this 
to the Institute before they've 
even seen the proposal " 

“Black!” Ruggles was shouting. 



“If you don't get me out of this the 
whole department will suffer. A 
security inquiry could hurt us when 
our contract comes up lor re- 
newal. This isn't time to let petty 
differences 

Both sides glared al each other 
and started taking away their 
respective prisoners, both of them 
struggling. I noticed that I was the 
only one laughing. 

“You're going to get it for this, 
Ruggles!" beaknose was yelling. 

Ruggles shouted something in- 
coherent. I could pick out "Black" 
and "damned Institute" before 
they vanished down the ramp. 

It would take them at least a day 
to straighten it all out. During that 
lime I could collect my data and 
pack up a few things. 

I didn't need to take much. 
From now on I was traveling light. 

In a day I could probably pres- 
sure a tenured position out of a 
small college somewhere. Maybe 
I would ask Winters which one he 
had attended. They seemed to 
produce pretty good people. 

But whatever happened, I was 
going to be clear of all this. 

Winters was standing next to 
me, excited by a lot of events he 
didn't understand. He had never 
seen anyone use jujitsu on a 
bureaucracy before. 

“This is terrible,” he said. “Dr. 
Black, you’ve got to do some- 
thing-" 

“I am,” I said. “In fact. I've just 
started." ★

ttQIGNAL coming in now, 

O 'Spector." The Coronis oper- 
ator showed the pink of her tongue 
to the ugly man waiting in the 
Belt patrolboat, half a mega- 
mile downstream. All that feky 
old hair, too, she thought. Yick. 
She pulled in her tongue and said 
sweetly, “It's from oh Fran- 
chise T welve." 

The man in the patrolboat 
looked uglier. His name was 
Space Safety Inspector Gollem 
and his stomach hurt. 

The news that a company inspec- 






139 





tor was in pain would have suited 
every molly squatter in the Bells. 
In fact, it wouldn't displease any- 
one from Deimos to the Rings. The 
only surprise would he the notion 
that Inspector Gollem had a 
stomach instead of a company 
contract tape. Gollem' All the 
friends Gollem had could col- 
onize a meson and he knew it. 

His stomach was used to that, 
though. His stomach was even gel- 
ling used to working for Coronis 
Mutual, and he still hoped it 
would grow immune to his boss, 
Quine. 

What was murdering him by 
inches was the thing he had hidden 
out beyond Franchise Fourteen 
on the edge of Coronis sector. 

He scowled at the screen where 
Quine's girl was logging in the 
grief for his next patrol. Having a 
live girl-girl for conimo was sup- 
posed to be good lor morale. It 
wasn't doing one thing for 
Gollem. He knew what he looked 
like and his stomach knew what 
the flash from Twelve could be. 

When she threw it on the screen 
he saw it was a bogy complaint, 
all right. Ghost signals on their 
lines. 

Oh, no. Not again. 

Not when he had them all fixed. 

Franchise Twelve was West 
Hem Chemicals, an itchy outfit 
with a jillabuck of cyborgs. They 
would send out a tracker if he 
didn't get over there soon. But 
how? He had just come that way. 



he was due upstream at Franchise 
One. 

"Reverse patrol," he grunted. 
"Starting Franchise Fourteen. 
Purpose uh unscheduled re- 
check of aggregation shots in 
Lleven plus expedited service to 
West Hem. Allocate two units 
additional power." 

She logged it in; it was all right 
with her if Gollem started with 
spacerot. 

He cut channel and coded in the 
new course, trying not to think 
about the extra power he would 
have to justify to Quine. If any- 
one ever got into his console and 
found the bugger bypass on his 
log he would be loading ore with 
electrodes in his ears. 

He keyed his stomach a shot of 
Vageez and caught an error in his 
code which he corrected with no 
joy. Most Belters took naturally 
to the new cheap gee-cumulator 
drive. Gollem loathed it. Sliding 
around arsy-versy instead of 
driving the can where you wanted 
to go. The old way, the real way. 

I'm the last machine-freak, he 
thought. A godlost dinosaur in 
space . 

But a dinosaur would have had 
more sense than to gel messed up 
with a dead dream. 

Ragnarok. 

His gee-sum index was wobbling 
up the scale, squeezing him retro- 
grade in a field stress-node he 
hoped. He slapped away a pod of 
the new biomonilor they had put

in his boal and took a scan outside 
before his screens mushed. Al- 
ways something to see in the Belts. 
This time it was a storm of little 
crescents trailing him, winking 
as the gravel tumbled. 

In the sky with diamonds . 

From Ragnarok's big ports you 
could see into naked space. That 
was the way they liked it once. His 
iron butterfly. He rubbed his 
beard, figuring Ragnarok in five 
hours, after he checked the squat- 
lernest in Fourteen. 

The weathersignal showed new 
data since he'd coded in the cur- 
rent field vortices and fronts. He 
tuned up, wondering what it must 
be like to live under weather made 
of gales of gas and liquid water. 
He had been raised on Luna. 

T HE flash turned out to be a 
couple of rogue males coming 
in from Big J's orbit. Jup stirred 
up a roek now and then. This pair 
read like escaped Trojans, esti- 
mated to node downstream in Sec- 
tor Themis. Nothing in that vol- 
ume except some new medbase. 
His opposite number there was a 
gigglehead named Hara who was 
probably too busy peddling mu- 
tant phage to notice them go by. A 
pity, Trojans were gas-rich. 

Feeding time. He opened a pack 
of Ovipuff and tuned up his music. 
His music. Human power music 
from the frontier time. Not for 
Gollem, the new subliminal bio- 
moans. He dug it hard, the right- 



eous electronic decibels. Chomp- 
ing the paste with big useless teeth, 
the cabin pounding. 

I can't get no sat is FA CTION! 

The biomonitor was shrinking in 
its pods. Good. Nobody asked you 
into Gollem's ship, you sucking 
symbiote. 

The beat helped. He started 
through his exercises. Not to let 
himself go null-gee like Hara. 
Like them all now. Spacegrace. 
His unfashionable body bucked, 
strained. A gorilla, no wonder his 
own mother had taken one look 
and split. Two thousand light- 
years from home. What home for 
Gollem? Ask Quine, ask the eont- 
pany. The companies owned space 
now. 

It was time to brake into 
Fourteen, 

Fourteen was its usual disorder- 
ly self, a giant spaw n of molly-bub- 
bles hiding an aggregate of rock 
that had been warped into synch 
long before his time. The first 
colonists had done it with re- 
action engines. Tough. A kid with 
a gee-cumulator could true an 
orbit. 

Fourteen had more bubbles 
every time he passed -and more- 
kids. The tissue tanks that paid the 
franchise were still clear but else- 
where the bubbles were layers 
deep, the last ones tethered loose. 
Running out of rock for their me- 
tabolite to work on. Gollem has- 
sled them about that every time 
he passed.

"Where are your rock nudg- 
ers?" he asked now when ihe squal- 
ler-chief came on his screen. 

"Soon. soon. ‘Spector Gollem." 
The squatterchief was a slender 
skinhead with a biotuner glued to 
one ear. 

"The company will cancel, Juki. 
Coronis Mutual won't carry you 
on policyholder status if you don't 
maintain insurable life support.’’ 

Juki smiled, manipulated the 
green blob. They were abandoning 
the rocks all right, drifting off into 
symbiotic space life. Behind Juki 
he saw a couple of the older chiefs. 

"You can’t afford to cut the 
services the company provides," 
he told them angrily. Nobody 
knew better than Gollem how min- 
imal those services were, but with- 
out them what? “Get some 
rock.” 

He couldn't use any more time 
here. 

As he pulled away he noticed one 
of the loose bubbles was a sick 
purple. Not his concern, even if he 
had the time. 

Cursing, he eased alongside and 
cautiously slid his lock probes 
into the monomolecular bubble- 
skin. When the lock opened a stink 
came in. He grabbed his breather 
and kicked into the foul bubble. Six 
or seven bodies were floating to- 
gether in the middle like a tangle of 
yellow wires. 

He jerked one out. squirted oxy 
at its face. It was a gut-bag kid, a 
born null-gee. When his eyes 



fanned open Gollem pushed him 
at the rotting metabolite core. 

"You were feeding it phage." He 
slapped the boy. “Thought it would 
replicate, didn't you? You 
poisoned it." 

The boy's eyes crossed, then 
straightened. Probably didn't get a 
word, the dialect of Fourteen was 
drifting last. Maybe some of them 
truly were starting to communi- 
cate symbiolically . Vegetable 
ESP. 

He pushed the boy back into the 
raft and knocked the dead meta- 
bolite through the waster. The 
starved mollybubble wall was 
pitted with necrosis, barely hold- 
ing. He Hushed his C0 2 lank over 
it and crawled back to his boat for 
a spare metabolite core. When he 
got back the quasi-living cyto- 
plasm of the bubbleskin was al- 
ready starting to clear. It would 
regenerate itself if they didn't poi- 
son it again with a C0 2 -binding 
mutant. That was the way men 
built their spacehomes now, soft 
hcterocatalytic films that ran on 
starlight, breathed human wastes. 

Gollem rummaged through the 
stirring bodies until he found a bag 
of phage between a woman and 
her baby. She whimpered when he 
jerked it loose, lie carried it back 
to his boat and pulled carefully 
away, releasing a flow of nutri- 
ent gel to seal his probe-hole. The 
mollybubble would heal itself. 

At last he was clear for Ragna- 
rok.

E PUNCHED course for 
Twelve and then deftly patched 
in the log bypass and set in his true 
trajectory. The log would feed 
from his cache of duplicates, an- 
other item nobody had better find. 
Then he logged in the expenda- 
bles he'd just used, padding it a 
piece as always. Embezzlement. 
His stomach groaned. 

He tuned up a rock storm to 
soothe it. There was an old poem 
about a man with a dead bird tied 
around his neck. Truly he had his 
dead bird. All the good things were 
dead, the free wild human things. 
He felt like a specter, believe it. A 
dead one hanging in from the days 
when men rode machines to the 
stars and the algae stayed in pans. 
Before they cooked up all the 
metabolizing Martian mac- 
romolecules that "tamed" space. 
And those tame men. women 
and kids breathing through 'em, 
feeding off 'em, navigating and 
computing and , making music 
with 'em mating with them, may- 
be! 

Steppe n wolf growled, worried 
the biomonilor. His metal-finder 
squealed. 

Ragnarok! 

Time shivered and the past 
blazed on his screens. He let him- 
self have one quick look. 

The great gold-skinned hull 
floated in the starlight, edged 
with diamonds against the tiny 
sun. The last Argo, the lonesomest 
Conestoga of them all. Rag- 



narok. Huge, proud, ungainly 
star machine, blazoned with the 
symbols of the crude technology 
that had carried man to space. 
Ragnarok who opened the way to 
Saturn and beyond. A human fist 
to the gods. Drifting now, a dead 
hulk, lost in the sea she'd con- 
quered. Lost and forgotten to all 
but Gollem the specter. 

No time now to suit up and 
prowl over and around her, to pry 
and tinker with her archaic fit- 
ments. The pile inside her was 
long and cold. He dared not even 
try to start it, a thing like that 
would set off every field-sounder 
in the zone. Quine’s stolen power in 
her batteries was all that warmed 
her now. 

I nside her also was his dead bird. 

He coasted into the main lock, 
which he had adapted to his probe. 
Just as he hit he thought he 
glimpsed a new bubble firming up 
in the storage cluster he had hung 
on Ragnarok s freightlock. What 
had Topanga been into? 

The locks meshed with a soul- 
satisfying clang of metal and he 
cycled through, eye to eye with the 
two old monster suits that hung in 
Ragnarok' s lock. Unbeliev- 

able, so cumbersome. How ever 
had they done it? He kicked up 
through dimness to the bridge. 

For one moment his girl was 
there. 

The wide ports were a wheeling 
maze of starlight and fire-studded 
shadows. She sat in the command

couch, gazing out. He could see 
her pure, fierce profile, the hint of 
girl-body in the shadows. Star- 
hungry eyes. 

Then the eyes slid around and 
the lights came up. His star girl 
vanished into the thing that had 
killed her. 

Time. 

Topanga was an old, sick, silly 
woman in a derelict driveship. 

She smiled at him from the 
wreckage of her face. 

“Golly? 1 was remembering " 
What an instrument it was still, 
that husky voice in the star haze. 
The tales it had spun for him over 
the years. She had not always been 
like this. When he had first found 
her, adrift and ill she had still 
been Topanga then. The last one 
left. 

“You were using the caller. 
Topanga, I warned you they were 
too close. Now they've picked you 
up." 

“I wasn't sending, Golly." Eerie 
blue, the wide old eyes reminded 
him of a place he had never seen. 



H E BEGAN to check the tell- 
tales he had hung on her con- 
sole leads. Hard to believe those 
antiques were still operational. 
Completely inorganic, a ton of 
solid-state circuitry. Topanga 
claimed she couldn’t activate it, 
but when she had had her first 
crazy fit he had found out other- 
wise. He had had her parked in 



Four then, in a clutch of space- 
junk. She had started blasting the 
band s with docking signals to 
men twenty years dead. Company 
salvage had nearly blown her out 
of space before he had gotten 
there he had had to fake a collis- 
ion to satisfy Quine. 

A telltale was hot. 

“Topanga. Listen to me. West 
Hem Chemicals are sending a 
hunter out to find you. You were 
jamming their miners. Don't you 
know what they’ll do to you'? The 
best the very best you'll get is a 
geriatric ward. Needles. Tubes. 
Doctors ordering you around, 
treating you like a thing. They'll 
grab Ragnarok for a space 
trophy. Unless they blast you 
first.” 

Her face crumpled crazily. 

“We can take care of ourselves. 
I’ll turn the lasers on 'em." 

“You’d never see them.” He 
glared at the defiant ghost. He 
could do anything, he wanted 
here, what was stopping him. 
“Topanga, I’m going to kill that 
caller. It’s for your own good." 

She stuck up her ruined chin, the 
wattles waving. 

“I’m not afraid of them." 

"You have to be afraid of a jerry 
ward. You want to end as a mess of 
tubing, under the gees'? I’m going 
to dismantle it." 

“No, golly, no!" Her stick arms 
drummed in panic, trailing skin. 
“I won’t touch it, I’ll remember. 
Please don’t leave me helpless." 



144 



GALAXY 




Her voice broke and so did his 
stomach. He couldn't look at it, 
this creature that had eaten his 
girl. Topanga inside there some- 
where, begging for freedom, for 
danger. Safe, helpless, gagged? 
No. 

“If 1 nudge you out of West 
Hem's range you'll be in three 
others. Topanga, baby, 1 can’t save 
you one more time." 

She had gone limp now, 
shrouded in the Martian oxy- 
blanket he had brought her. He 
caught a blue gleam under the 
shadows and his stomach squirted 
bile. 

Let go, witch. Die before you kill 
me, too. 

He began to code in the gee-cum 
unit he had set up here. It was 
totally inadequate for Ragna- 
rok's mass but he could overload 
it for a nudge. He would stabilize 
her on his next pass-by, if only he 
could find her without wasting 
too much power. 

From behind him came a husky 
whisper. “Strange to be old--" 
Ghost of a rich girl's laugh. “Did I 
ever tell you about the time the 
field shifted, on Telhys?” 

“You told me." 

Ragnarok was stirring. 

“Stars,” she said dreamily. 
“Hart Crane was the first space 
poet. Listen. Stars scribble on our 
eyes the frosty sagas, the gleaming 
cantos of unvanquished space. O 
silver sinewy:” 

Gollem heard the hull clang. 



Someone was trying to sneak out 
of Ragnarok. 

E LAUNCHED himself down- 
shaft to the freight lock, found 
it cycling and jacknifed back to 
get out through his boat at the 
main lock. He was too late. As he 
sprang into his cabin the screens 
showed a strange pod taking off 
from behind that new bubble. 

Dummy, dummy . 

He suited up and scrambled out 
across Ragnarok s hull? The new 
bubble was still soft, mostly nutri- 
gel. Pushing his face into it he 
cracked his breather. 

He came back to Topanga in a 
blue rage. 

“You are letting a phage-runner 
park on Ragnarok. " 

“Oh, was that Leo?" She 
laughed vaguely. “He’s a courier 
from the next zone— Themis, isn't 
it? He calls by sometimes. He’s 
been beautiful to me. Golly." 

"He is a stinking pagerunner and 
you know it. You were covering 
for him." Gollem was sick. The 
old Topanga would have put “Leo" 
out the trash hole. “Not phage. 
Not phage on top of everything, 
Topanga.” 

Her ancient eyelids fell. “Let it 
be. Golly. I'm alone so long," she 
whispered. “You leave me for so 
long." 

Her withered paw groped out, 
seeking him. Brown-spotted, criss- 
crossed with reedy pulses. Knobs, 
strings. Where were the hands of 




MOTHER IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS

the girl who had held the camp on 
Tethys! He looked at the line of 
holographs over the port and saw 
her. The camera had caught her 
grinning up at black immensity, 
the wild light of Saturn's rings re- 
flected in her red-gold hair. 

"Topanga, old mother," he said 
painfully. 

“Don't call me mother, you plas- 
tic spacepig," she blazed. Her car- 
cass jerked out of the pilot couch 
and he had to web her back, hating 
to touch her. A quarter gee would 
break these sticks. “I should be 
dead,” she mumbled. “It won't be 
long — you'll be rid of me." 

Ragnarok was set now, he could 

go- 

“Maintain, spacer, maintain," 
he told her heartily. His stomach 
knew what lay ahead. None of it 
was any good. 

As he left he heard her saying 
brightly, “Gimbal, check," to her 
dead computer. 



II 

H E TOOK off highgain for Fran- 
chise Twelve and West Hem. 
Just as he had the log tied back into 
real lime his caller bleeped. The 
screen stayed blank. 

"Identify." 

“Been waitin' on you, Gollem." 
A slurred tenor. Gollem's beard 
twitched. 

“One freakin' fine ship." The 
voice chuckled. “Mainmouth by 



Co'onis truly flash that ship." 

“Stay off Ragnarok if you want 
to keep your air," Gollem told the 
phagerunner. 

The voice chuckled again. "My 
pa'tners truly grieve on that, "Spec- 
tor." There was a click and he 
heard his own voice saying, 
“Topanga, baby, I can't save you 
one more time." 

“Deal, 'Spector, deal. Why we 
flash on war?" 

“Blow your clobbing tapes," 
Gollem said tiredly. “You can't 
run me like you run Hara." - 

“ 'Panga," the invisible Leo said 
reflectively. “Freakin’ fine old 
fox. She tell 1 fix her w ire fire?" 

Gollem cut channel. 

The phager must have set a short 
smoking to win her trust. Vulner- 
able. 

A n old sick eagle dead in space 
and the rats have found her . 

They wouldn't quit, either. Rag- 
narok had air, water, power. 
Transmitters. Maybe they were 
using her caller, maybe she was 
telling the truth. They could take 
over. Shove her out through the 
lock. 

Gollem's hand hovered over his 
console. 

If he turned back now his log 
would blow it all. And for what? 
No, he decided. They’ll wait, 
they'll sniff around. They want to 
take me, too. They’ll wait to see 
how much squeeze they have. Pray 
they don’t find out. If only they 
don’t start trashing .

He had to get some more power 
somewhere and jump Ragnarok 
out of there. How, how? Like try- 
ing to hide Big Jup. 

He noticed that he had punched 
the biomonitor into a sick yellow 
blob and hurled it across the cabin. 
And how much longer could he 
cool Coronis? 

Right on cue, his company 
hotline blatled. 

“Why aren't you at Franchise 
T wo, Gollem?" 

It was mainmouth Quine 
himself. Gollem took a deep 
breath and repeated his course re- 
versal plan, watching Quine's lit- 
tle mouth purse up. 

“After this clear with me. Now 
hear this, Gollem, " Quine leaned 
back in his bioflex, pink and 
plump. Coronis was no hardship. 
“I don't know what you think 
you're into with Franchise Three 
but 1 want it stopped. The miners 
are yelling and our company 
won't tolerate it." 

Gollem shook his shaggy head 
like a da/ed bull. Franchise Three 
was a heavy metal mining outfit. 

“They're overloading their trac- 
tor beams for hot extraction," he 
told Quine. “It's in my report. If 
they keep it up they'll have one 
bloody hashup. And they won't be 
covered because their contract 
annex specifies the load limits." 

Quine's jowls twitched ominous- 
ly. “Gollem. Again I warn you. It 
is not your role to interpret the 
contract to the policyholder. If the 



miners choose to get their ore out 
faster by abrogating their contract 
that's their decision. Your job is 
to report the violation, not to an- 
noy them with technicalities. Right 
now they are very angry with you. 
And I trust you don't imagine that 
our company "reverent pause 
“appreciates your initiative?" 

Gollem made an inarticulate 
noise in his throat. He should be 
used to this. Coronis wanted - its 
piece quickly and it wanted to 
avoid paying compensation 
when the thing blew. The miners 
got paid by the shuttle load and 
most of them couldn't tell a con- 
tract annex from a Hush valve. By 
the time they found out they'd be 
dead. 

“Another item." Quine was 
watching him. “You may be get- 
ting some noise from Themis sec- 
tor. They seemed to be all sweated 
up about a bit of rock.” 

“You mean those Trojans?” 
Gollem asked slowly. “What's 
there?" 

“Have you been talking to 
Themis?" 

“No." 

“Very well. You will not, repeal 
not, deviate from your patrol. You 
are on a very thin line with us, Gol- 
lem. If your tapes show anything 
whatever in connection with 
Themis you're out of the company 
and there will be a lien against you 
for your overdrawn pension. And 
there will be no transport rights. 
Do I make myself clear?"

G OLLEM cut channel. When he 
could control his hands he 
punched Weather for the updated 
rogue orbits. Both rocks were now 
computed to node in sector 
Themis, but well clear of Themis 
main. He frowned. Who was hurt- 
ing? His ephemeris showed only the 
new medbase in the general vol- 
ume, listed as Nonaffiliated, no 
details. It seemed to be clear, too. 
If that polluted Hara . 

Gollem grunted. He understood 
now. Quine was hoping for some 
hassle in Themis which might 
persuade Ceres Control to reas- 
sign part of that sector to him. 
And the medbase wasn't com- 
pany, it was expendable for publi- 
city purposes. Truly fine, he 
thought. Much gees for Quine if it 
works. 

He was coming into West Hem 
Chemicals. Before he could sig- 
nal, his audio cut loose with curses 
from the cyborg chief. Gollem 
swerved to minimize his intrusion 
on their body lines and the chief 
cooled down enough to let him re- 
port that he had killed their bogy. 

“It was an old field-sounder," 
Had they identified Ragnarok? 

"Slope out. Go." The old cy- 
borg op couldn't care less. He had 
electrode jacks all over his skull 
and his knuckles sprouting wires. 
Much as Gollem loved metal, this 
was too much. He backed out as 
gingerly as he could. The 
men — or maybe the creatures- -in 
there were wired into the controls 



of robot refining plants on all the 
nearby rocks, and he was hashing 
across their neural circuit. 
Wouldn't be surprising if they 
fired on him one day. 

His next stop was the new ag- 
gregation franchise in Eleven. It 
was a slow-orbit complex on the 
rim of the Kirkwood Gap, a 
touchy location to work. If they 
started losing rocks they could 
spread chaos in the zone. 

Aggregation meant power units, 
lots of them. Gollem began 
figuring Ragnarok's para- 
meters. His stomach also began 
to gripe him; the outfit that had 
leased Eleven had big plans for a 
self-sustaining colony on a slim 
budget. They needed those units 
to bring in gas-rich rocks. 

When he got inside Gollem saw 
they had other problems loo. 

"We've computed for two-sigma 
contingency," the Eleven chief re- 
pealed liredly. They were stand- 
ing beside a display tank show- 
ing the projected paths of the 
rocks they intended to blast. 

"Not enough," Gollem told him. 
“Your convergence-point is 
smeared the hell all over. You lose 
a big one and it'll plow right into 
Ten." 

"But Franchise Ten isn't occu- 
pied," the chief protested. 

"Makes no difference. Why do 
you think you got this franchise 
cheap? The company's delighted 
to have you aggregating this 
lode, they're just waiting for you 



148

to lose one rock so they can cancel 
and resell your franchise. 1 can't 
certify your operation unless you 
recompute." 

"But that means buying com- 
puter imput from Ceres Main!" he 
yelped. "We can’t afford it.” 

"You should have looked at the 
instability factors before you 
signed." Gollem said woodenly. 
He was wishing the chief didn't 
have all his hair; it would be easier 
to do this to a skinhead. 

"At least let me bring in the 
rocks we have armed," the chief 
was pleading. 

"How many one-gee units have 
you got out there'.’” (iollem point- 
ed. 

"Twenty-one.” 

"I’ll take six of them and certify 
you. Thai's cheaper than recom- 
puting." 

The chiefs jaw sagged, lightened 
to a snarl. 

"You polluted bastard!" 

Suddenly there was a yelp 
behind them and the commo op 
lore off his earphones. The chief 
reached over and flicked on the 
voder, filling the bubble with an 
all-band blare. Kor a minute Gol- 
lem thought it was a Hare front, 
and then he caught the human 
scream. 

"MAYDAY! MA-AY-DA- 
AA Y ! GO-OLLLL ” 

He slammed down the voder, the 
sweat starling out all over him. 

"What in space ” the chief be- 
lt a n. 



"Old beacon in the Gap.” Gol- 
lem was pushing past them. “I 
have to go kill it." 

H t PILED into his boat and 
threw in the booster. No lime 
for power units now; that yell 
meant Topanga was in real trouble. 
She wasn't calling dead men. 

If he tied in the spare booster he 
could override the field-forms for 
a slraighler course. Strictly ver- 
boten. He did so and then opened 
his commo channels. Topanga 
wasn't there. 

fire.’ Collision? More like, Leo 
and friends had made their move. 

He hurtled downstream in a 
warp of wasted power, his hands 
mechanically tuning the board 
in hopes of pulling in some phag- 
ers' signals, something. He 
picked up only far-off mining 
chatter and a couple of depot ops 
asking each other what the May- 
day was. Someone in Sector 
Themis was monotonously call- 
ing Inspector Hara. Hara wasn't 
answering, as usual, only the 
automatic standby from Themis 
main. Gollem cursed them all im- 
partially, trying to make his 
brain yield a plan. 

Why would the phagers move in 
on Ragnarok so fast? Not their 
style, confrontation. If he blew 
they'd lose the ship, they'd have to 
cope with a new inspector. Why 
risk it when they had him by the 
handle already? 

Maybe they figured it was no

risk. Gollem’s fist clenched and 
unclenched on the tuner in a heavy 
rhythm. Paint it black , he thought. 
They have to keep her alive till 1 
get there. They want me. 

What, then, to do'.’ Would they 
believe a threat to scream it all the 
way up to Ceres Control? Don't 
bother to answer. They knew as 
well as he did that a company bust 
would end with Topanga in a gerry 
ward, Ragnarok in Quine's 
trophy park and Gollem in a skull- 
cage. But how to break Topanga 
loose from them? If he tried to jive 
along with them the first thing 
they’d do would be to shoot her up 
on phage. Addiction dose. Him 
too why had he left her there 
alone? 

He was going around this misery 
orbit for the nth time when he no- 
ticed the Themis voice had boost- 
ed gain and was now trying to 
reach Coronis, his home base. 
Quine's home base. No answer. 

Against his stomach's advice he 
tuned it up. 

“Medbase Themis to Coronis 
main, emergency. Please answer, 
Coronis. Medbase Themis call- 
ing Coronis, emergency, please 

The woman was clearly no 
commo op. 

Finally Quine's girl chirped: 
"Medbase Themis, you are dis- 
turbing our traffic. Please damp 
your signal." 

"Coronis, this is an emergency. 
We need help we're going to get 
hit!” 



"Medbase Themis, contact your 
sector safety patrol officer, we 
have no out-of-sector authoriza- 
tion. You are disturbing our traf- 
fic." 

"Our base won't answer! We 
have to have help, we have casual- 
ties 

A male voice cut in. “Coronis, 
put me through to your chief at 
once. This is a medical priority." 

“Medbase Themis, Sector Chiet 
Quine is outstation at present. We 
are in freight shuttle assembly for 
the trans-Mars window, please 
stand by until after launch." 

"But " 

“Coronis out." 

Gollem grimaced, trying to pic- 
ture Quine going outstation. 

He went back to pounding on 
his brain. The Themis woman 
went on calling. “We are in an im- 
pact path, we need power to move. 
If anyone can help us please come 
in. Medbase Themis 

He cut her off. One Ragnarok 
was enough and his was just ahead 
now. 

T il FRF was a faint chance they 
weren't expecting him so soon. 
He powered down and drifted. As 
his screens cleared he saw a light 
move in the bubbles behind the 
freight lock. 

His one possible break, if they 
hadn't yet moved that phage in- 
board. 

He grabbed the wrecking laser 
controls and kicked the patrol- 



150 



GALAXY 




boat straight at Ragnarok’s main 
lock. The laser beam fanned over 
the bubbles, two good slices before 
he had to brake. The crash sent 
him into his boards. The docking 
probes meshed and he went head- 
first into Ragriarok’s lock. As it 
started to cycle he burned the over- 
ride, setting off alarms all over the 
ship Then he was through and 
caroming up the shaft. Among the 
hoots he could hear more clang- 
ing. Phagers were piling out 
through freight lock to save their 
bubbles. If he could get to the 
bridge first he could lock them out. 

He twisted, kicked piping and 
shot into the bridge, his arm aimed 
at the emergency hatch-lock lever. 
It had been not used for dec- 
ades — he nearly broke his wrist, 
yanking the lever against his own 
inertia and was rewarded by the 
sweet grind of lock toggles far 
below. 

Then he turned to the command 
couch where Topanga should be 
and saw he was too late. 

She was there all right, both 
hands to her neck and her eyes roll- 
ing. Behind her a lank hairless 
figure was holding a relaxed pose, 
in his first a wirenoose leading 
around Topanga’s throat. 

“Truly fine. Inspector." The 
phager grinned. 

For a second Gollem wondered 
if Leo hadn't noticed the hand- 
laser Gollem pointed. Then he 
saw that the phagehead was hold- 
ing a welder against Topanga's 



side. Its safety sleeve was off. 

“Deal, Gollyboy. Deal the fire 
down.” 

No way. After a minute Gollem 
sent his weapon drifting by Leo’s 
arm. He didn't take the bait. 

“Open up.” The phager jerked 
his chin at the hatch lever and 
Topanga gave a bubbling whine. 

When Gollem opened that the 
game was over all the way. He 
hung frozen, his coiled body sens- 
ing for solidity behind him, mea- 
suring the spring. 

The phager jerked the wire. 
Topanga's arms flailed. One hor- 
rible eye rolled at Gollem. A spark 
in there, trying to say no. 

"You're killing her. Then I tear 
your head off and throw you out 
the waster.” 

The phager giggled. “Why you 
flash on killin’?” Suddenly he 
twisted Topanga upside down, 
feel trailing out toward Gollem. 
She kicked feebly. Weird, her bare 
feet were like a girl’s. 

“Open up.” 

When Gollem didn’t move the 
phager’s arm came out in a grace- 
ful swing, his fingers flaring. The 
welding arc sliced, retraced, 
sliced again as Topanga con- 
vulsed. Topanga was quiet now. 

“Way to go.’’ The phager 
grinned. “Truly tough old bird. 
Open up.” 

“Turn her loose. Turn her loose. 
I’ll open.” 

“Open now.” The arm came out 
again. 



MOTHER INTHESKYWITH DIAMONDS 



151 




Suddenly Topanga made a weak 
twist, scrabbling at Leo's groin. 
The phager's head dipped. Gol- 
lem drove inside his arm, twisted it 
against momentum. The welder 
rocketed out around the cabin 
while he and the phager thrashed 
around each other, blinded by 
Topanga's robe. The phager had a 
knife now but he couldn't get 
braced. Gollem felt legs lock his 
waist and took advantage of it to 
push Topanga away. When the 
scene cleared h.e clamped the 
phager to him and began savage- 
ly to collect on his investment in 
muscle building. 

Just as he was groping for the 
wire to tie up the body something 
walloped him back of the ear and 
the lights went out. 

He came to with Topanga yell- 
ing, “Val, Val! I’ve got 'em!" 

She was hanging on the console 
in her hair using both hands to 
point an ancient Thunderbolt 
straight at him. The muzzle 
yawned smoke a foot from his 
beard. 

"Topanga, it's me — Golly. 
Wake up, spacer, let me tie him 
up." 

"Val?'' A girl laughing, scream- 
ing. “I’m going to finish the mur- 
dering mothers, Val!” 

Valentine Orloff, her husband, 
had been in the snows of Gany- 
mede for twenty years. 

“Val is busy, Topanga," Gollem 
said gently. He was hearing hull 
noises he didn’t like. “Val sent me 



to help you. Pul down the jolter 
and help me lie up this creep, 
spacegirl. They're trying to steal 
my boat." 

He hadn't had lime to lock it, he 
remembered now. 

Topanga stared at him. 

"And why do I often meet your 
visage here?" she croaked. "Your 
eyes like unwashed platters 

Then she fainted and he flung 
himself downshaft to the lock. 

His patrolboat was swinging 
away. Tethered to it was the phage- 
runners' pod. 

He was stranded on Ragnarok. 

R AGE exploded him back to the 
bridge consoles. He managed to 
send one weak spit from Ragna- 
rok's lasers' after them as they 
picked up gees. Futile. Then he 
pulled the phager's head over his 
knee and clouted it and turned to 
setting up Topanga with an i.v. in 
her old cobweb veins. How in hell 
had those weak claws held a jol- 
ler? He wrapped a gel sheath over 
her burns, grinding his jaw to still 
the uproar in his stomach. 

With one hand on the cycle but- 
ton he checked frowning. He could 
use some information from 
Leo — what were they into in his 
patrol sector? 

Then his head came together and 
his fist crunched the eject. His 
patrol sector? 

If the companies ever got their 
hands on him he'd spend the rest of 
his life with his brains wired up. 



152 



GALAXY 




paying for that patrolboat. If he 
was lucky. No way, no where to go. 
The companies owned space. 
Truly he was two thousand light- 
years from home now —on a dead 
driveship. 

Dead? 

Gollem threw back his lank hair 
and grinned. Ragnarok had a rich 
ecosystem, he'd seen to that. No- 
body but the phagers knew she was 
here and he could probably hold 
them out for a while. Long enough, 
maybe, to see if he could coax 
some power out of that monster- 
house without waking up the 
sector. Suddenly he laughed out 
loud. A thing like a rusty shutter 
was sliding in his mind, letting in 
glory. 

“Man, man!" he muttered and 
stuck his head into the regenera- 
tion chamber to check the long 
trays of culture stretching away 
under the lights. 

It look him a minute to under- 
stand what was wrong. 

No wonder the phagers came 
back so fast, no wonder he was 
laughing like a dummy. They'd 
seeded the whole works with 
phage culture. A factory. The 
first trays were near sporing, the 
air was ropy. He hauled them out, 
inhaled a clean lungful and jettis- 
oned the ripe trays. 

Then he crawled back in to 
search. On every staging the 
photosynthetic algae were start- 
ing to clump, coagulating to the 
lichen-like symbiote that was 



phage. Not one clean tray. 

In a lew days Ragnarok would 
have no more air. 

But he and Topanga wouldn't 
care. They'd be through the walls 
in phagefreak long before. 

He was well and truly shafted 
now. 

He Hushed some oxy into the 
ventilators and kicked back to the 
bridge. Get some clean meta- 
bolite. Or die. 

Who would give him air? Even if 
he could move Ragnarok , the 
company depots and franchises 
would be alerted. He might just as 
well signal Coronis and give him- 
self up. Maybe Quine wouldn't 
bother to reach him and Topanga 
in time. Maybe better so. Wards. 
Wires. 

Topanga groaned. Gollem felt 
her temples. Hot as plasma, old 
ladies shouldn't play war. He rum- 
maged out biogens, marveling at 
the vials, ampoules, tabs, hypo- 
sprays. Popping who knew what to 
keep alive. Contraband she and 
Val had picked up in the old free 
days, her hoard would stock a 

Wait a minute. 

Medbase Themis. 



Ill 

E TUNED up Ragnarok' s 
board. The Themis woman was 
still calling, low and hoarse. He 
cranked the antennae for the 
narrowest beam he could get. 




MOTHER IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS 



153 




“Medbase Themis, do you 
read?” 

“Who are you? Who's there?" 
She was startled out of her code 
book. 

“This a spacesweep mission. I 
have a casualty." 

“Where — " The man took it. 
“This is Chief Medic Krans, 
spacer. Y ou can bring in your casu- 
alty but we have a rogue headed 
through our space with a gravel 
cloud. If we can't get power to 
move the station in about thirty 
hours we'll be holed out. Can you 
help us?" 

"You can have what I've got. 
Check coordinates." 

The woman choked up on the 
decimals. No use telling them he 
couldn't do them any good. The 
gee-cum unit he had in Ragnarok 
wouldn’t nudge that base in time 
for Halley's comet. And Ragna- 
rok's drive — if it worked ft would 
be like trying to wipe your eye 
with blowtorch. 

But their air could help him. 

The drive. He bounced down the 
engineway, knowing the spring in 
his muscles was partly phage. Only 
partly. A thousand times he had 
come this way, a thousand times 
lorn himself away from tempta- 
tion. Gleefully now he began to 
check out the circuits he had 
traced, restored the long-pulled 
fuses. There was a sealed hyper- 
golic reserve for ignition. A 
stupefying conversion process, a 
plumber’s nightmare of heat-ex- 



changers and back-cycling. Crazy, 
wasteful, dangerous. Enough cir- 
cuitry to wire the Belt. Unbe- 
lievable it has carried man to Sa- 
turn, more unbelievable it would 
work today. 

He clanked the rod controls. No 
telling what had crystallized. The 
converter fuel chutes jarred out 
thirty years' accumulated dust. 
The ignition reserve was prob- 
ably only designed for one emer- 
gency firing. Would he be able to 
ignite again to brake? Learn as you 
go. One thing sure, when that ven- 
erable metal volcano burst to life 
every board from here to Coronis 
would be lit. 

When he got back to the bridge 
Topanga was whispering. 

"We left the haven hanging in 
the night O thou steel cogni- 
zance whose leap commits 

“Pray it leaps," he told her and 
began setting course, double- 
checking everything because of the 
phagemice running in the shadows. 
He wrapped Topanga's webs. 

He started the ignition train. 

The subsonic rumble that grew 
through Ragnarok filled him with 
terror and delight. He threw him- 
self into the webs, wishing he had 
said something, counted down 
maybe. Blastoff. Go. The rumble 
bloomed into an oremill roar. 
Gees smashed down on him. Every- 
thing in the cabin started raining 
on the deck. The web gave side- 
wise and the roar wound up in a 
scream that parted his brain and

then eerily dwindled into silence. 

When he struggled back to the 
board he found the burn had cut 
right. Ragnarok was barreling 
toward Themis. He saw Topan- 
ga's eyes open. 

“Where are we headed?” She 
sounded sane as soap. 

“I'm taking you over to the next 
sector, Themis. We need metabo- 
lite, oxygen. The phagers ruined 
your regenerators." 

“Themis?" 

“There's a medbase there. 
They'll give us some." 

Mistake. 

"Oh, no no!" She struggled up. 
"No, Golly! I won't go to a hospi- 
tal don't let them take me!" 

“You're not going to a hospital, 
Topanga. You're going to slay 
right here in the ship while I go in 
lor the cores. They'll never know 
about you. We'll be out of there in 
minutes." 

No use. “God hate you, 
Gollem." She made an effort to 
spit. “You're trying to trap me, 1 
know you. Never let me free. You 
won't bury me here, Gollem. Rot 
in Moondome with your ugly 
cub^l'm going to Val!" 

“Cool, spacer, you're yawing." 
He got some tranks into her final- 
ly and went back to learning Rag- 
narok. The phage was getting 
strong now. When he looked up the 
holographs were watching him 
drive their ship. The star heroes. 
Val Orlov, Fitz. Hannes, Mura, all 
the great ones. Sometimes only a 



grin behind a gold-washed head- 
plate, a name on a monster suit 
beside some mad hunk of ma- 
chine. Behind them, spacelost 
wildernesses lit by unknown 
moons. All alive, all so young. 
There was Topanga with her 
arm around that other spacegirl, 
the dark Russian one who was still 
orbiting lo. They grinned past him, 
bright and living. 

When they start talking we've 
had it . 

H F SCT the gyros to crank Rag- 
narok into what he hoped was 
attitude lor the retro burn. If he 
could trust the dials, there was 
enough ignition for braking and 
for one last burn lo get out of there. 
But where would he go from Med- 
base? Into the sky with diamonds. 

He heard himself humming and 
decided to lock the whole thing 
into autopilot. No matter what 
shape that computer was in it 
would be saner than he. 

Have you seen your mother, 
baby standing in the shadows . 

When he began hearing Iron 
Butterfly he went down and threw 
out half the trays. The th»ee re- 
maining oxy tanks struck him as 
hilarious. He cracked one. 

The oxy sobered him enough to 
check the weather signal. The 
Medbase woman was still trying 
to raise Themis Main. He resist- 
ed the impulse lo enlighten her 
about the companies and concen- 
trated on the updated orbits of 



MOTHER IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS 



155 




the Trojan rogues. He saw now 
what had Medbase sweating. The 
lead rogue would miss them by 
megamiles but it was massive 
enough to have stirred up a lot of 
gravel. The small rogue behind 
was sweeping up a tail. The rock 
itself would go by far off but that 
gravel cloud would rip their bub- 
bles to shreds. 

He had to get there and out 
again fast. 

He sniffed some more oxy and 
computed the rogue orbits on a 
worst-contingency basis. It looked 
okay for him. His stomach 
flinched; even under phage it had 
an idea what it was going to be 
like when those medics found out 
they were wasted. 

He saw Topanga grinning. The 
phage was doing her more good 
than the tranks. 

“Not to worry, stargirl. Golly 
won't let 'em gel you." 

“Air" She was trying to point to 
life-support, which had long since 
gone red. 

“I know, spacer. We're getting 
air at Medbase." 

She gave him a strange un-To- 
panga#mile. "Whatever you say, 
little Golly." Whispering hoarsely. 
“I know you’ve been beauti- 
ful 

Her hand reached, burning. This 
he positively could not take. Pity 
his music was gone. 

"Give us verses as we go, star 
girl." 

But she was too weak. 



“Read me 

Her scanner was full of it. 

"In oil-rinsed circles of blind 
ecstasy." Hard to dig. until the 
strobing letters suddenly turned 
to music in his throat. "Man hears 
himself an engine in a cloud!" he 
chanted, convoyed by ghosts. 

what marathons new-set 
among the stars!" 

"The soul, by naphtha fledged 
into new reaches, already knows 
the closer clasp of Mars 

It was indeed fortunate, he 
discovered, that he had set the 
autopilot and stayed suited up. 

H IS first clear impression of 
Medbase was a chimpanzee's 
big brown eyes staring into his 
under a flashprobe. He jerked 
away, found himself peeled and 
tied on a table. The funny feeling 
was the luxury of simulated grav- 
ity. The chimpanzee turned out to 
be a squat little type in medwhites, 
who presently freed him. 

“I told you he wasn't a phager ' 
It was the woman's voice. 

C raning. Gollem saw she was no 
girl-girl and had a remarkable ab- 
sence of chin. The chimpanzee 
eventually introduced himself as 
Chief Medic Krans. 

“What kind of ship is that?" the 
woman asked as he struggled into 
his suit. 

“A derelict. " he told them. 
"Phagerunners were using it. My 
teammate's stoned. All he needs is 
air." 



156 



GALAXY 




“The power units,” said Kranz. 
“I'll help you bring them over." 

"No need for you to go in -I've 
got them ready to go. Just give me 
a couple of metabolite cores to 
take back to start the air clear- 
ing." 

Unsuspicious. Kranz motioned 
the woman to show the way to their 
stores. Gollem saw that their base 
was one big cheap bubble. The 
molly hadn't even seamed to- 
gether under the film; a couple of 
pebbles would finish them. The 
ward had twenty-odd burn cases in 
cocoons. Themis didn’t bother 
much with burns. 

An old spacerat minus a lot of 
his original equipment came 
wambling over to open up. Gol- 
lem loaded as much metabolite as 
he could carry and headed for the 
lock. At the port the woman 
grabbed his arm. 

“You will help us?" Her eyes 
were deep green. Gollem concen- 
trated on her chin. 

“Be right back." He cycled out. 

Ragnarok was on a tether he 
didn't recall securing. He 
scrambled over, found the end 
fouled in the lock toggles. If there 
had been tumble - bye-bye. 

When he got inside he heard To- 
panga’s voice. He hustled up the 
shaft. 

Once again he was too late. 

While he had been in the stores 
unsuspicious Chief Medic Kranz 
had suited up and beat him into 
Ragnarok. 



“This is a very sick woman, 
spacer," he informed Gollem. 

"The legal owner of this dere- 
lict, Doctor. I'm taking her to 
Coronis Base." 

“I’m taking her into my ward 
right now. We have the facilities. 
Get those power units." 

He could see Topanga's eyes 
close. 

“She doesn't wish to be 
hospitalized. " 

“She's in no condition to decide 
that," Kranz snapped. 

T HE metabolite was on board. 

Doctor Chimpanzee Kranz ap- 
peared to have elected himself a 
driveship ride to nowhere. Gol- 
lem began drifting toward the 
ignition panel, beside Topanga's 
web. 

"I guess you're right, sir. I'll 
help you prepare her and we'll 
lake her in." 

But Kranz' little hand had a little 
stungun in it. 

“The power units, spacer." He^ 
waved Gollem toward the shaft. 
There weren't any power units. 
Gollem backed into the metabo- 
lite, watching for the stunner to 
waver. It didn't. There was only 
one chance left, if you could call it 
a chance. 

"Topanga, this good doctor is 
going to take you into his hospi- 
tal," he said loudly. “He wants 
you where he can take good care of 
you.” 

One of Topanga's eyelids 



MOTHER IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS 



157 




wrinkled, sagged down again. An 
old, battered woman. No chance. 

“Can you handle her, doctor?" 

“Get that power out now." He 
had the safety off. 

Gollem nodded sourly and 
started downshaft as slowly as he 
could. Kranz came over to watch 
him, efficiently out of reach. 
What now? Gollem couldn't reach 
the ignition circuits from here 
even if he knew how to short them. 
Just as he turned around to look 
for something to fake a power cell 
it happened. 

A whomp like an imploding 
mollybubble smacked into the 
shaft. Chief Medic Kranz went into 
a slow cartwheel. 

“Good girl!" Gollerfi yelled. 
“You got him " He batted the 
stunner out of Kranz’ limp glove 
and kicked upward. When he 
raised his head he found he was 
looking into the snout of To- 
panga's jolter. 

“Gel out of my ship," she 
yelped. “You lying suitlouse. And 
take your four-eyed, needle-suck- 
ing friend with you!" 

“Topanga, it's me it's Golly.” 

“1 know who you are," she said 
coldly. “You’ll never trap me." 

“Topanga!" he cried. A bolt 
went by his ear, rocking him. 

“Out!" She was leaning down 
the shaft, squeezing on the jolter. 

Gollem backed slowly down, col- 
lecting Kranz. The witch figure 
above him streamed biotape and 
bandages, the hair that once shone 



red standing up like white fire. She 
must be breathing pure phage, he 
thought. 

Can’t last long ... All I have to 
do is go slow . 

“Out!" She screamed. Then he 
saw she had Kranz’ oxy tube 
clamped under one arm. This 
seemed to be his day for under- 
estimating people. 

"Topanga," he began to plead 
and had to dodge another jolt- 
bolt. She couldn’t go on missing 
forever. He decided to haul 
Kranz out and cut back into the 
ship through the emergency port. 

There was a welder in the Med- 
base port rack. He boosted Kranz 
along the tether and into the lock. 
The Medbase woman was waiting 
on the other side. As the port 
opened he pushed Kranz at her and 
grabbed the welder. The chinless 
wonder learned fast; she flung her- 
self on the welder and started to 
wrestle. There was solid woman- 
muscle under her whites, but he 
got a fist where her jaw should have 
been and threw himself back into 
the lock. 

As it started to cycle he realized 
she had probably saved his life. 

The outer lock had a viewport 
through which he could sec Ragna- 
rok's vents. The star field behind 
them was dissolving. 

He let out an inarticulate groan 
and slammed the reverse cycle to 
let himself back into Medbase. 
As soon as it cracked he bolted 
through, carrying the medics to 



158 



GALAXY 




the deck. The port behind him lit 
up like a solar flare. 

T HEY all stared at the silent tor- 
rent of flame pouring out of 
Ragnarok. Then she was moving, 
faster, faster yet. The jetstream 
swung and the port went black. 

Luckily the port area was hard- 
walled, with the command nucleus 
behind it. Gollem and the woman 
followed Kranz to the main port. 
Rannarok was a dwindling fire- 
tail among the stars. 

“Topanga doesn’t like hospi- 
tals,” Gollem told them. 

“The power units,” Kranz said 
urgently. “Call her back.” 

The woman was pushing Gollem 
toward the commo board. 

“No way. She just blew the last 
ignition charge. Where she's 
headed now she goes.” 

“What do you mean? To 
Coronis?" 

“Never." He rubbed his shaggy 
head. "I I don't recall exactly. 
Mars, maybe. The sun" 

“With the power units that 
would have saved these people.” 
Kranz’ face hardened into the ex- 
pression he probably used on gan- 
grene. "Thanks to you. 1 suggest 
that you remove yourself from 
my sight for the remainder of our 
joint existence.” 

“There never were any power 
units,” Gollem said, starting to 
go out. “The phagers got my boat 
and you saw for yourself what that 
drive was like. It would have 



broken you apart— believe me.” 

The woman followed him out. 

“Who was she, spacer?” 

“Topanga Orloff,” Gollem said 
painfully. “Val Orloff's wife. 
They were the first Saturn mis- 
sion. That was their ship, Ragna- 
rok. She was holed up in my 
sector.” 

“You just wanted air.” 

Gollem nodded. They were by 
the base display tank. The com- 
puter was running a real-time dis- 
play of the oncoming Trojans. The 
green blip was Medbase and the 
red blip with the smear was the 
smaller Trojan and attendant 
gravel tail. He studied the vectors. 
No doubt. 

Now it was dark, period. Sleep 
time coming up. The people here 
might eat breakfast, but for tTue 
they wouldn't eat lunch. By noon 
or thereabouts Medbase would be 
organic enrichment on a swarm 
of space ice. 

So would ex-inspector Gollem. 

The two medics went out on the 
wards and Kranz unbent enough 
to accept Gollem’s offer to man 
the commo board. The spacer wob- 
bled in to watch him. The sight of 
Ragnarok's blast-out had lit his 
fires. • 

Gollem taped a routine red-call 
and began to hunt across the 
bands. The old man mumbled 
about ships. Nobody was answer- 
ing, nobody would. Once he 
thought he heard an echo from To- 
panga, but it was nothing. Her oxy 



MOTHER IN THE SKY WITH DIAMONDS

must be long gone by now, he 
thought. A mad old phage-ghost on 
her last trip. Where had he com- 
puted her to? He seemed to recall 
something about Mars. At least 
they wouldn’t end in some trophy- 
hunter's plastic park. 

"You know what they got in 
them cocoons? Squatters!" The 
old man squinted out of his good 
side to see how Gollem took this. 
“Skinheads. Freaks 'n' crotties. 
Phagers, even. Medics, they don't 
care.” He sighed, scratched his 
burned skin with his stump. 
“Grounders. They won't last out 
here." 

“Too right," Gollem agreed. 
“Like maybe be gone tomorrow." 
That tickled the old man. 

T OWARD midnight Kranz took 
over. The woman brought in 
some hot redeye. Gollem started 
to refuse and then realized his 
stomach wasn’t hurting any 
more. Nothing to worry about 
now. He sipped the stimulant. The 
woman was looking at a scanner. 

“She was beautiful," she 
murmured. 

“Knock it off, Anna," Kranz 
snapped. 

She went on scanning and 
suddenly caught her breath. 

"Your name. It's Gollem, isn't 
it?" 

Gollem nodded and got up to go 
look at the tank. 

Presently the woman Anna came 
out after him and looked at the 



tank, too. The old spacer was 
asleep in the corner. 

“Topanga was married to a 
George Gollem once," Anna said 
quietly. “They had a son. On 
Luna." 

Gollem took the scanner 
cartridge out of her hand and 
flipped it into the wastechute. She 
said nothing more. They both 
watched the tank for a while. Gol- 
lem noticed that her eyes were al- 
most good enough to make up for 
her chin, but she didn't look at him. 
The tank didn't change. 

Around four she went in and 
took over from Kranz and the men 
settled down to wait. 

“Medbase Themis calling 
Medbase Themis calling anyone," 
•he woman whispered. 

Kranz went out. It seemed a lot 
of work to breathe. 

Suddenly Kranz snapped his 
fingers from the next room. Gol- 
lem went to him. 

“Look." 

They hung over the tank. The 
red smear was closer to the green 
blip. Between them was a yellow 
spark. 

“What is that?" 

Gollem shrugged. “A rock.” 

“Impossible, we scan-swept that 
area a dozen times." 

“No mass,” Gollem frowned. 
“It's a tank ghost.” 

Kranz began systematically 
flushing the computer input 
checks. The woman left the board 
and came to hang over the tank.

Gollem watched absently, his 
brain picking at phage-warped 
memories. Something about the 
computer.. On impulse he went to 
the com mo board and ran the re- 
ceiver through its limits. All he got 
was a blast of squeals and whis- 
tles, the stress-front of the incom- 
ing rocks. 

“What is it?" Anna’s eyes were 
like oscilloscopes. 

“Nothing." 

Kranz finished his checks. The 
yellow ghost stayed in, sidling to- 
ward the red smear. If that were a 
rock, and it had about a hundred 
times more mass than it could 
have, it just might deflect the Tro- 
jan. But it didn’t. And there was 
the gravel cloud. 

Gollem played monotonously 
with the board. The old spacer 
snored. The minutes congealed. 
Kranz shook himself, took Anna 
out to tour the wards. When they 
came back they stopped at the 
tank. 

The whatever-it-was stayed in, 
closing on the Trojan. 

Sometime in the unreal dimlight 
hours he heard it, wavering on a 
gale of space noise: "I hav,e 
contact! Val! I’m coming 

They crowded around him as he 
coaxed the tuners. There was noth- 
ing there. Presently a ripple of re- 
lays tripped off in the next room 
and they'all ran to the tank. It was 
dead; the computer had protect- 
ed itself against an induction 
overload. 



T HEY never knew exactly what 
happened. 

“It’s possible," Gollem admit- 
ted to them. It was long after noon 
when they decided to eat. 

“While we were on the way here 
I know I computed that Trojan all 
the way to Medbase. It was after 
that I got really bombed. Maybe 
1 threw a bridge into the course 
computer, maybe it was already 
in. Say she took off with no course 
setting. Those old mechs are set to 
hunt. It’s possible it inverted and 
boosted straight back out that tra- 
jectory to the rock." 

“But your ship had no mass," 
Kranz objected. 

“That thing was a space-scoop 
feeding a monster drive. The pile 
dampers were cheese. Ragnarok 
could have scooped herself solid 
right through the gravel cloud and 
blown as she hit the Trojan. You 
could gel a pocket sun." 

They went over it again at dark- 
period. And again later while he 
and Anna looked at nothing in 
particular out the ports. Some 
time later yet he showed her a 
script he’d fixed for the wall of 
Medbase Free Enclave: 

Launched in abyssal cupolas 
of space 

Toward endless terminas, Eas- 
ters of speeding light 
Vast engines outward veering

On clarion cylinders pass out

N O MATTER what Mr. Thomp- 
son said, it was a good day for 
frogging and fishing. The morning 
sun had that bright double halo 
that meant the whole day would be 
elear. I got up before Mom, took 
some old pie from where she hid it 
last night, grabbed my wading 
shoes and net and lit out for the 
ereek. I had to leave real quiet. 
I'm not supposed to be going down 
to the ereek any more. They say 
its dangerous down there. 

But the creek ain't dangerous if 
you know what you're doing. You 
just have to stay away from the 
pink water spots and you're sale all 
the way. 

I took the long way around the 
Baxter place. 1 think Pop was right 
about them; something's wrong 
there. Dr. Baxter ain't been at 
Town Meeting for a long time 
Pop thinks that maybe some sick 
people moved in on the Baxters. 

So I walked through the bram- 
bles on the edge of the woods where 
the new trees are growing. It was 
sunny and fine and the breeze came 
in nice and sweet from the north. 
No cities up that way. not for 
hundreds of miles. 

Caught some crickets along the 
way, the big kind with the long 
wings. They make good bait for the 
slickery fish in the shallows. All I 
got to do is tangle them up in the 
net and put it down in the water. 
The stickery fish go right for em. 
Mr. Thompson, he says that it ain't 
safe to eat 'em, which just shows 



you how much he knows. I eat 'em 
all the time. 

1 headed right for Rotten Log 
Hollow. There's a nice big hole in 
there and a gravel bar and yob can 
catch lots of frogs there if you're 
careful. They like to hide under 
that old broken pipe, under the 
foam. I got maybe a dozen there, 
last time out. 

First I walked along the bank, 
looking down into the water to see 
what was there, you know. It was 
still and there wasn't a lot of foam 
piling up. There wasn't any fish 
either, so I sat down in the warm 
gravel, ate my pie and pulled on my 
wading shoes They've got high 
tops that Pop always tells me to 
pull all the way up, but I ain't 
bothered with that for years. Heck, 
a little water can't kill me. 

After a little while I went into 
the water real cautious careful 
not to scare the frogs. 1 worked my 
way out into mid-stream and 
started peering around for frogs. I 
had my net in my belt but I don't 
use it much not for frogs. 

So there I was in the creek, care- 
ful as could be, when all of a sud- 
den this bunch of rocks and grass 
comes rolling down the bank and 
this city fellow comes down after it, 
trying to grab hold of bushes on the 
way. He hit the pipe and it slopped 
him, but he sure messed up the 
water. 

A couple of minutes went by and 
he started to get up. He had a heck 
of a time doing it. He kept Railing 



FROG POND

his arms around and pulling 
himself back onto the pipe. 

I was mad because he'd scared 
the frogs, so I yelled out, "Hey, 
mister, don't do that!" 

Boy, did he look up fast. You'd 
of thought I was a C.D. man or 
something the way he snapped 
around. His eyes got wild and he 
shook all over. Before he could fall 
again 1 called out. “It's just me, 
mister, down in the creek." 

He turned around, grabbing the 
pipe for balance. I waited till he'd 
steadied himself and then 1 said, 
“You're scaring the frogs." 

“Scaring the frogs?" he yelled 
back, sounding like frogs were 
monsters. 

"Yeah. I'm trying to catch some. 
Can you just sit there a minute?" 

I could see he was thinking this 
over. Finally he sat back on the 
pipe like he was worn out and said 
real quiet, “Why not?" And he 
leaned his head back and closed his 
eyes. 

I GOT three frogs while he was 
sleeping there. They were big 
and fat. I put a stick through their 
throats and let 'em dangle in the 
creek to keep fresh. I almost had 
the fourth one when the city guy 
woke up. 

“Listen," he called to me. 
“Where am I?” 

"Rotten Log Hollow." 

"Where is that?" 

I sure couldn't see the point in 
yelling all the time, so I told him to 



come closer and we could talk. 
"Talk makes less noise. Maybe I 
can still catch some frogs if we're 
just talking." 

He hustled off the pipe and 
scrambled along the shore, splash- 
ing dirt and stones into the water. 

"Hi," I said when he got closer. 

"Hello." He was still awful ner- 
vous and had that funny white look 
around his eyes, sort of like turtle 
skin. “What's your name?" 

He was really trying to be friend- 
ly and even if Mr. Thompson says 
in that spooly voice of his that 
there ain't any friendly strangers, 
well, this guy wasn't anything 1 
couldn't handle. 

“My name is Althea," 1 told 
him, polite like Mom tells me to 
be. “But mostly my friends call me 
Thorny. Who are you?" 

“Uh " He looked around then 
back. “Slanl Stan just call me 
Sian." 

You could see that he was lying. 
He wasn't even good at it. So I 
said, sure, his name was Stan. Then 
I waited for him to say something. 

"You like this place?" he asked. 

"Yeah. I come here lots of 
limes." 

"You live around here, then'?' 1 ' 

A dumb question. He was really 
all city. Maybe he thought we had 
subways out here in the country. 
He kept looking around like he 
expected a whole herd of people to 
come running out of the pipe. 

“Yeah. I live at the Baxter 
place." It was a lie but he'd told me 



164 



GALAXY 




one - and besides, Pop said I 
wasn't to tell people where we live, 
just in case. 

“Where's that?” He said it like 
he wasn’t really interested, like he 
didn't give a damn where the Bax- 
ter place was. He just wanted to 
talk to someone. I pointed back to- 
ward the Baxter place and told him 
it was about a mile along the road. 

“Do a lot of people live there, at 
the Baxter place?" 

"Not too many. About six or 
seven. You planning on moving in, 
mister?" 

He laughed at that. It was one of 
those high laughs that sounds like 
crying. My brother Davey cries 
like that a lot. It ain't right a six- 
year-old kid should cry like that. 
About this Stan or whoever I 
didn't know. 

“What's funny, mister?" I would 
have gone and left him there, but I 
saw that he was standing almost in 
some green gunk that comes out of 
the pipe and washes on shore so I 
said to him a little louder, “And 
you belter get away from there." 

He slopped laughing. “From 
where? Why?" 

Wow, he was nervous. 

"From that." I .pointed so he 
would get panicked again. “That 
stuff is bad for you. It can give you 
burns if your not used to it." That 
isn't quite right. Some people 
can't get used to it, but it never 
burned me, not even the first time. 
Mr. Thompson says that means 
selective mutations are adapting to 



the new demands of the environ- 
ment. Mr. Thompson thinks that 
just because he's a geneticist he 
knows everything. 

Stan leaped away from the green 
stuff like it was about to bite him. 

"What is it?" 

"1 don't know. Just stuff that 
comes out of the pipe. When the 
Santa Rosa pumping station got 
blown up a couple of years back 
this broke and started dripping that 
green stuff." I shrugged. “It won't 
hurt you if you don't touch it." 
Stan looked like he was going to 
start laughing again, so I said, real 
quick, "I bet you’re from Santa 
Rosa, huh?" 

"Santa Rosa? What makes you 
think that?" He sure got jumpy if 
you asked him anything. 

"Nothing. Santa Rosa's the first 
big city south of here. I just fig- 
ured you probably had to come 
from there. Or maybe Sonoma or 
Napa, but those ain't too likely." 

"Why do you say that?" He was 
real close ntfw and his hands were 
balling into fists. 

"Simple," I said, trying to keep 
my eyes off his fists. He must have 
been sick or something, the way he 
kept lightening and loosening his 
fingers. “The big highway north is 
still open, but not the one between 
Sonoma and Santa Rosa." 

He wobbled his head up and 
down at that. “Yes, yes of course. 
That would be why." He looked at 
me, letting his hands open up 
again!" I was glad to see that. “Sor- 



FROG POND 



165 




ry, Thorny. I guess I'm jumpier 
than I thought." 

“That's okay," I told him. 1 
didn't want to set him off again. 

S O STAN stood back and 
watched me while I looked for 
frogs. 

After a while he asked me, “Is 
there anyone needing some help on 
their farms around here? Anyone 
you know of?" 

I said no. 

“Maybe there's a school some- 
where that needs a teacher. Unless 
I miss my guess 1 could teach a few 
things. You kids probably don't 
have too many good teachers.” 
What a spooly thing to say. “My 
Pop teaches at the high school. 
Maybe he could help you find 
work." We didn't need teachers, 
but if Stan knew about leaching 
maybe one of the other towns could 
use him. 

“Were you born around here?" 
Stan was looking around the hol- 
low like anyone's having been born 
here was real special and unlikely. 

“Nope. Over at Davis." That 
was where Pop had been doing the 
research into plant viruses, before 
he and the Baxters and the Thomp- 
sons and the Wainwrights and the 
Aumendsens and the Leventhals 
bought this place here. 

“On a farm?" 

“Sort of." 

His voice sounded like being 
born on a farm was something 
great like saving the seaweed or 



maybe going back to the moon 
some day. 

“I’ve always wanted to live in the 
country. Maybe now I can." He 
stumbled along the bank to the 
sandy spot opposite the gravel bar 
and sat down. Boy, he was really 
dumb. 

“There's snakes there," I said, 
real gentle. Sure enough, up he 
shot, squealing like Mrs. Wain- 
wright's pig. 

“They won't hurt you. Just 
watch out for them. They only bite 
if you hurt 'em or scare 'em." 

And with him jumping up and 
down I wasn't going to get any 
more frogs, that was for sure. So I 
decided to settle just for con- 
versation. 

"Is any place safe in this bank?" 
he asked. 

“Sure," I said with a smile. 
"Right where you were sitting. Just 
keep an eye out for the snakes. 
They're about two feel long and 
sort of red. About the color of 
those pine needles." I pointed up 
the bank. “Like that." 

“Dear God. How long have the 
pine needles been that way?" 

I slogged over into the deep 
water. “About the last live, six 
years. The smog does it." 

“Smog?" He gave me a real 
blank look. “There isn't any smog 
here." 

“Can't see it or even smell it. 
Mr. Thompson says there's too 
much of it everywhere so we can’t 
tell its there any more. But the 



166 



GALAXY 




trees know it. That's why they turn 
that color." 

“But they'll die," he said. He 
sounded real upset. 

“Maybe. Maybe they'll change." 

"How can they? This is terrible." 

“Well, the pines are holding up. 
Most of the redwoods south of the 
Navarro River died years ago. Lots 
of them are still standing," I 
explained, seeing him go blank 
again. "But they aren't alive any 
more. But the pines here, they 
haven't died yet and maybe they 
aren't going to." A real sharp 
shine was coming into his eyes and 
1 knew 1 had said more than I 
should have. 1 tried to cover up as 
best as I could. “We learn about 
this in school. They say we'll have 
to find ways to handle all the 
trouble when we grow up. Mr. 
Thompson tells us about biology." 
That last part was true, at least. 

“Biology. At your age." 

That kind of talk can still make 
me mad. “Look, mister, I'm fif- 
teen years old, and that's plenty old 
to know about biology. And 
chemistry, loo. Just because this 
is a long way from Santa Rosa, 
don’t think we can’t read or like 
that.” 

I was really angry. I know I’m 
little, but, heck, lots of people are 
small now. 

“I didn’t mean anything. I was 
just suprised that you have such 
good schools here." Boy, that Stan 
really couldn’t lie at all. 

“What do they teach where you 



come from?" I knew that might 
make him jumpy again, but I 
wanted to gel back at him for that. 

“Nothing important. They teach 
history and language and art with 
no emphasis on survival. Why, 
when some of the students last se- 
mester requested that the ad- 
ministration include courses in 
things like forestry, basket mak- 
ing and plant grafting, they called 
out the C.D. and there was a riot. 
One of the C.D. " Stan licked his 
lips in an odd way "was am- 
bushed and left hanging from a 
I am post by his heels." 

“That's bad," I said. It was, too. 
That was the first time I found out 
how bad it had got in the cities. 
Stan was still smiling when he told 
me what had been done to the C.D. 
It wasn't nice to hear. He kept try- 
ing to make it better by calling it 
gelding. He said that the last time 
they did it was during the black- 
white trouble. 

And that guy wanted to teach in 
our schools. He said that he knew 
what it was really like with people 
all over and could contribute to 
our system. I could see Pop's face 
getting real set and hard at what 
Stan was saying. But Stan insist- 
ed he thought that it was very im- 
portant for people to understand 
“The System" -like it was a re- 
ligious thing. You know? I was be- 
ginning to get scared. 

“Fifteen is too old," he went on. 
“Do you have any brothers or sis- 
ters younger than yourself?" 



FROG POND 



167 




I WAS pretty cautious about an- 
swering him. “Yes. I got two 
brothers. And one sister." I 
didn't tell him that Jamie was al- 
ready doing research work or that 
Davey didn't do anything. Or that 
Lisa was getting ready to board in 
the next town so that we could keep 
the families from interbreeding 
too much. 

“Older or younger." 

“Mostly older.” So I lied again. 
At least I was good at it. He didn't 
think to ask anything more about 
them. 

"Too bad. We are going to have 
to change what’s been happening. 
Martial law, searches without 
warrants, confiscations. It's ter- 
rible, Thorny , terrible." 

He must have thought that liv- 
ing out here we didn’t hear any- 
thing or see anything. He kept tell- 
ing me how bad it was to have 
soldiers everywhere and how they 
were doing awful things. 1 knew 
about that and a lot of other things, 
too. And 1 knew about how there 
were gangs that killed people and 
robbed them and murder clubs 
that just killed people for fun. 
Heck, Jules Leventhal used to be a 
clinical psychologist and he 
taught us a lot about the way mobs 
act and how too many people 
make problems for everybody. 

“How are things north of here?" 
Stan was asking. 

“Not too bad. Humboldt 
County is doing pretty good and 
there are more people around the 



Klamath River now.” I sure didn't 
want a guy like him staying with 
us. 1 figured that maybe telling 
him about conditions in north 
might encourage him to move on. 
But he just looked tense and nod- 
ded, like that crazy preacher who 
wanted us all to die for god, a 
couple of years back. “Of course, 
that’s redwood country so they 
might have trouble there in a few 
years.” 

He looked at me real hard. 
“Thorny, do you think you could 
tell me how to get to Humboldt 
county?" 

Dumb, dumb, I told you. All he 
had to do is keep going up old 101 
and there it would be. That crazy 
guy hadn't even looked at a map. 
Or else he had and was trying to 
trap me, but 1 ain’t easy to trap. 

“You can keep going up the 
main highway,” I said, talking 
real sincere-like. “But there might 
be ( .1). men up ahead, you know, 
near IJkiah. Or Willits. The best 
way is to cut over to the coast and 
just follow it up." 

There, I thought. That ought to 
gel him; he was jumpy enough be- 
fore. 

“Yes, yes, that would work. And 
Eureka is a port there would be 
the ocean for access 

He went on like that lor about 
five minutes. He wanted to 
launch some kind of attack 
against The System, to protect 
the People, but for another Sys- 
tem. He kept talking about rights 



168 



GALAXY 




and saying how he knew what the 
People really wanted and he 
would change things so that they 
could have it. He said he knew 
what was best for them. Wow, 1 
wish Mr. Leventhal could have 
heard him. 

"And what about you? You 
should be in school, right?” 

“Nope," 1 said. “We have 
school just two days in the week. 
The rest of the time is free." 

I wondered if that much had 
been all right to tell. We weren't 
supposed to let out much about 
our school. 

“But it's a waste, don't you 
see'.’" Stan crouched down on the 
bank, looking like a huge skinny 



rabbit squatting there. “This is the 
time when you must learn political 
philosophy. You should be learn- 
ing about how society works. It’s 
terribly important." 

“1 know how society works," I 
said. 

Heck, all the kids who learned 
from Mr. Wainwright know about 
that. After all, one of the reasons 
the Wainwrights came along with 
the rest of us was that the politi- 
cians in Sacramento didn't like 
what he was teaching about the 
way they worked. And they were 
society. 

“Not this society," he said in a 
real haughty way. like Mr. Thomp- 
son when he's crossed. "Society in

the cities, in the population cen- 
ters." 

He was going on that way when I 
saw a couple of frogs moving on 
the bottom. I watched where they 
were going and then I reached 
down for them, holding my breath 
as my face hit the water. I dragged 
one of them out but the other got 
away. 

"Spending your time catching 
frogs,” Stan spat. 

"Sure. They taste real good. 
Mom fixes ’em up with batter and 
fries 'em.” 

"You mean you eat them?" he 
squeaked, looking gray. 

“Of course. They're meal ain't 
they?" I waded over to the other 
frogs on the stick and stuck the new 
one on, too. He wiggled and 
jerked for a bit and then stopped. 

"But frogs? How can you eat 
frogs?" 

“Easy." 1 didn’t think he was go- 
ing to get over it: that we eat frogs. 
Just to be sure, I reached over and 
grabbed the stick with the frogs on 
it. “See? This one," I put my 
thumb on one's belly, “is the fat- 
test. It’ll taste real good.” 

“And do you really chase after 
them without seeing them?" 

I turned around and looked at 
him. He was standing up on the 
other bank and the frightened look 
was back in his eye. “No. You got 
to see what you're after.” 

“But in that water --” 

“Oh, I don't open my eyes like 
you do,” I said, real casual-like. “I 



go after them with these." And I 
slid up the membranes. 

Stan looked like he'd swallowed 
a salamander. “What was that,’" 
he demanded, looking more 
scared than ever. 

“Nictating membranes -I was 
engineered for it," I said. 

“Mutants," he gibbered. “Al- 
ready!" 

He started trying to back up the 
bank watching me like he thought 
I was a werewolf or something. 
He slipped and stumbled until he 
got to the top and then he ran 
away — I would hear him crashing 
through the brush making more 
noise than a herd of deer. 

By the time he left the whole hole 
was filled with leaves and sticks 
and rocks and I knew that there 
wouldn’t be any more frogs or fish 
that day, so I took the frogs on the 
stick, got off my wading shoes and 
started back for the house. I knew 
Mom would be mad but I was hop- 
ing that the frogs would help her 
get over it. I guessed I had to tell 
them about Stan. They didn't like 
people coming here. 

They were real mad about it. 
The funny thing is that they were 
maddest about my having shown 
my eyes. But cripes, that was just 
one little flap of skin that Mr. 
Thompson got us to breed. Just 
one louzy bit of extra skin near the 
eye. 

But to hear him tell it, you’d 
think he’d changed the whole 
world. if

great net of interstellar matter 
transmitters in which Earth now 
shared. Whoever had originated 
the technology, it had passed into 
the hands of the Fallaran, a 
humanoid race from a high- 
gravity planet. They had taken the 
spread of the Interface as a racial 
ideal and mounted a great survey 
force, the Furtherance, to carry 
the relays across interstellar space; 
and in due course they met the 
Sasarenn, a reptilian species 
whose only ideal was competi- 
tion. About the middle of Earth’s 
nineteenth century, the Sasarenn 
War Fleet set forth to hold back 
the Furtherance, occupying star 
systems ahead of them, then 
spreading from star to star as the 
Fallaran threw them out. As un- 
compromising as the Sasarenn in 



their own way, the Fallaran could 
not bring themselves to leave any 
inhabited planetary system out of 
the Interface; but shifting the Sas- 
arenn grievously damaged the vic- 
timized planets. Through Victo- 
ria’s reign and two World Wars, 
the battle front had spread out 
and about the time of men's first 
moon landing the two fleets began 
their interstellar race to Earth. 

The Sasarenn, from a position 
of strength, rather than occupa- 
tion, held the Solar System for 
three months of 1981. McKay, 
hauled from an orbiting Apollo 
and appointed Earth planetary 
agent, had worked the trick which 
finally shook them from Earth and 
the Interface. As mementoes, he 
retained the Sasarenn Recovery 
and Liaison Vehicle, his badge of 
office, and a communications 
relay embedded in the back of his 
skull. The ship's computer-auto- 
pilot, though no longer fanatically 
anti-lnlerlace, could still kill him 
if he went too far with it. 

When the relay gave him a head- 
swimming jolt, just then, he 
thought for a moment that he had. 
But this was only the standard 
communications alert, set far too 
high by the Sasarenn to make sure 
he never missed it. McKay shook 
his head and plugged in to the 
ship’s perception circuits. 

“Acknowledge," he told the 
computer. 

The RLV cockpit had no instru- 
mentation: plugged in, the pilot 



172 



GALAXY 




had a complete heads-up display, 
including all-around vision. The 
signal was coming from a liny 
message sphere that had burst 
out of Interface into orbit near the 
RLV's fuel store. At the end-of- 
message pulse McKay acknowl- 
edged again and it destroyed itself. 

"Where is my crew right now?" 
McKay asked the spacefield con- 
trol tower. 

"Due here from Houston on a 
jet transport in three hours. We 
were notified of their takeoff ten 
minutes ago." 

"Have the plane turned back." 
McKay said crisply. Control knew 
better than to argue. He flicked on 
the ship’s external speakers. “May 
1 have the hangar doors open.’" 

As the ground crew obeyed, he 
started up the RLV’s air-cushion 
pads and moved it slowly out into 
the sunlight. The computerized 
systems check cascaded over the 
field of view, all perfect. He began 
stepping up the fusion power level, 
moving out to the main runway. 

"Transport is on its way back to 
Houston," the lower reported. 

“Tell Houston I'm on my way 
down, please, and give me a clear 
climb to Interface." 

"You can have one now, if you 
go due east.” 

"I’ll take it." McKay had the 
intakes open and the jets adjusted 
for STOL. The ship took off with a 
roar, wings sweeping forward, 
then back again as airspeed picked 
up. 



A MILL above Montana McKay 
contacted the orbiting Inter- 
lace relay, setting up a straight 
aerial transfer to the Houston vi- 
cinity. A half-mile hole in the sky 
blinked open, joining north to 
south without visual spectacle 
just the sudden appearance of half 
a bank of cumulus, which grew 
swiftly to completeness as the 
RLV flew through the invisible 
disc into the Texas morning. As 
yet there were no procedures set 
lor this — he had shot out uncom- 
fortably close to another aircraft. 

"Where the hell did you come 
from?” Air Traffic demanded as 
he banked clear. 

"Recovery and Liaison Vehicle 
to Houston field," McKay 
snapped back. "Is that the trans- 
port I'm here to intercept?" 

“They were about to start their 
approach when you sprang out of 
nowhere," the angry voice replied. 

“Never mind. I’ll follow them 
down and pick up my crew. We 
have a rescue assignment.” How 
to win friends and influence 
people, McKay thought as he 
trailed the jet down the sky. The 
rest hadn’t done him much good. 

He held off, changing to VTOL 
thrust as the transport landed, and 
came down on the grass alongside 
the runway as the jet turned at the 
end of it. Slazeck and Devlin 
tumbled out of a hatch and ran 
across to him. 

As they approached, McKay re- 
quested and received from the tow- 



HERE COMESTHE SUN 



173 




er a prompt clearance lor immedi- 
ate takeoff. 

The mission solved one prob- 
lem, McKay reflected as Slazek 
and Devlin came aboard, ex- 
changed easy greetings. Alter a 
highly frustrating month in space, 
personal relations had been pretty 
strained when the RLV team had 
last separated. Now they had a 
new purpose. 

“Okay, Mac, we're strapped 
in,” Slazeck reported. McKay had 
found a runway. A surge of 
acceleration lifted the RLV sky- 
ward. “This must be a pretty hot 
deck you were throwing weight." 

“We're going interstellar again. 
Officially, this time. A personal 
message came through from 
Kiliath he wants us to haul some 
friends of his off a planet some- 
where in the Interface.” 

Slazeck asked, “Some Further- 
ance boys in trouble?" 

“You could say that. They're 
researchers, studying a sun ap- 
proaching nova. It seems they 
miscalculated the date: the star's 
ahead of schedule.” 

Nothing shook Slazeck. “How 
long do we have? And where's 
"somewhere?" " 

“We have a few hours. The sun's 
on its last pulse now. We'll tune in 
a fix presently." The RLV was 
still climbing. “We'll get out of 
your hair," McKay told Air Traf- 
fic after acquiring the satellite 
again. “Up Interface." 

Not to impose the world's end on 
the Texas sky, he was going up to 



the satellite first. A two-dimen- 
sional circle of blackness opened 
before them and as they moved out 
of the sunlight, the bright dust of 
distant stars came out across it. 
The ship emerged silently into 
space far above Earth's night and 
the blue sky behind was scrubbed 
away. 

"All right, you guys, let's go." 



T HE Interface system was quite 
something, McKay reflected as 
the RLV paused in parking orbit 
to permit its crew to get into pres- 
sure suits. Any spot in the Galaxy 
could be reached as easily, given an 
Interface relay within reasonable 
reach. The hard bit was Further- 
ance, the task of physically haul- 
ing the relays from star to star. To 
dale the Interface encompassed 
only a small part of one Milky 
Way arm but that meant thou- 
sands of stars and hundreds of 
races, man newest of all. For all 
their often embarrassing dedi- 
cation to Furtherance, McKay 
had a great respect for the 
Fall a ran and their achieve- 
ments always provided Earth es- 
caped being overrun by the mem- 
ber races of the Interface. 

“One thing I don't get, Mac," 
said Slazeck. “1 thought from my 
dealings with Kiliath that the Fur- 
therance space research was all in 
the nature of survey work. Why 
have they been fooling around 
with a star that's going nova?" 



174 



GALAXY 




McKay couldn't answer that. 
“We still have very little idea what 
goes on in the Interface itself. 
'Furtherance' is fine but Further- 
ance of what?" 

“Why, for instance, doesn’t 
Kiliath make the rescue himself 
with one of the big starships?'' 
asked Devlin. 

“That's what the U.N. would 
like to know, I expect," said 
McKay as they returned to the 
cockpit. “After we came so near 
to losing our ship on the last mis- 
sion, they think we should refuse 
any more rescue assignments." 

“I can't see any point to that," 
Slazeck observed. “Since the ship 
still thinks of itself as part of an 
active fighting unit, it won't let it- 
self be pulled apart for study. All 
we can do with it is gain opera- 
tional experience. We need to use 
every chance." 

“Right," said McKay, plugging 
in again to the featureless panels. 
“Use it, risk it and learn from it, I 
say. Hut they want me to restrict 
its use to liaison assignments.” 

“If we refuse rescue missions we 
won’t get any liaison assign- 
ments," said Slazeck. “The Fur- 
therance commanders are pilots, 
not politicians.” 

The ship was a headache, 
McKay thought again as he set up 
Interface for the nova system. 
With anti-personnel systems 
inside and out, the computer-auto- 
pilot — a law unto itself in these 
matters could quite literally carve 



up any spies who tried to probe the 
ship's design. Most ways in which 
it surpassed human tech- 
nology the fusion pile, the high- 
energy fuel (processed somehow 
from liquid hydrogen) and the 
computer-autopilot itself were 
consequently beyond examina- 
tion. Even in flight the RLV 
exercised its own judgment: quite 
possibly it would decide the com- 
ing rescue was too risky or contra- 
dicted the Sasarenn programing. 
Under such circumstances it could 
refuse to obey him. 

McKay activated the relays with 
some caution. But the vision of 
disaster he half expected did not 
materialize: save for the elec- 
tronic display, he wouldn't have 
known there was an Interface 
there. He fired the vernier motors 
and the ring traced by the com- 
puter moved up and over them. 
The daylit face of the planet 
loomed out from behind it and 
seconds later the ship was in sun- 
light. 

J UST ordinary sunlight, white- 
sunlight- the RLV's sensors 
were unable to detect the merciless 
contraction supposed to be going 
on there. But the sun was already 
a good deal hotter than Earth's 
and its output, according to the 
sensors, was going up even as 
they watched. McKay felt an old 
tension, left over from test pilot 
days, clamp down on him. 

The computer began to translate 



HERE COMES THE SUN 



175 




details of the Fallarans' predica- 
ment. 

The Fallaran had an outpost 
here, an orbital research instal- 
lation that could escape at a 
moment's notice. But a party of 
scientists had landed on the 
planet to study the effects of the 
recent peak in the sun’s output. 
They had mistimed their subject. 
Instead of swelling slowly to a 
dull, distended red, the star had 
flared violently and was already 
caving in for the final detonation. 

McKay cut off the computer 
translation, which was struggling 
incoherently with advanced 
Fallaran astrophysics. The impor- 
tant point was, the weather had 
boiled up down there and the 
team’s own ship had been wrecked 
trying to pick up the Fallaran 
scientists. The RLV, designed 
specifically for rescue missions, 
might just be able to get them out 
in time. 

He switched on the translator 
again. 

“There are six of us down 
there," the Fallaran voice came on. 
The neutral translation was still 
tripping, seeking verbal correla- 
tives for strong emotion. “Not all 
have protective clothing- ” 

This man — McKay found 
himself unable to think of the 
fallaran as an alien was blaming 
himself for the miscalculation. 
The computer couldn’t cope with 
what he wanted to say. 

“We'll go down at once,” said 



McKay. “I suggest you retreat to 
safety. Are they on this side of the 
planet?” 

“We will be over the city in ten 
minutes.” 

“City? Is the planet inhabited?” 

“The last emigrants left Tessar 
many centuries ago.” 

With Interface, McKay realized, 
interstellar evacuation would 
indeed be possible. 

“That partly explains the 
Furtherance presence, perhaps," 
said Slazeck. “This isn’t a new sur- 
vey, it’s the last act of an epic." 

“What were we doing on Earth 
at the time?” McKay murmured. 
“Crossing the Atlantic?" Where, 
he wondered, could the evacuees 
of an entire planet go? Kiliath 
hadn't told McKay that he, 
Slazeck and Devlin would share the 
death of someone else's home- 
world. Tessar until now McKay 
had not even known its name. 

The city was coming up now, 
though it was hidden by storm- 
clouds moving inland from the 
angry-looking sea. With luck, they 
might have a break in the weather 
for the actual pickup. 

“Let’s go- up Interface.” 

Moving from space to atmo- 
sphere was always tricky. McKay 
had put the disc at twenty thou- 
sand feet, but still turbulence 
threw the ship about before he got 
the jets going and the wings prop- 
erly swept. Conditions were getting 
pretty rough down here. Before 
entering the clouds, McKay took 



176 



GALAXY 




another sight of the sun: allowing 
for the atmosphere, it was already 
five percent hotter than when the 
RLV had arrived. 

“The sun's contraction should 
slow up when helium burning 
starts," Slazeck suggested. 

“If it's going nova, it's been 
burning helium for thousands of 
years," said McKay, straining his 
memory. “Even if the burning's 
intermittent, I should say it's 
going again now." He had never 
imagined in his Project Apollo 
days that stellar physics could 
mean life and death to him. “It's 
been pulsating with increasing 
force and frequency — until now 
it’s unstable. On this contraction 
temperatures and pressures in 
the core will go high enough to 
start synthesizing heavier ele- 
ments, and that energy release will 
trigger higher synthesis, up the 
packing fraction curve till the 
explosion stabilizes -if you see 
what 1 mean by a stable explosion. 
But I’m not sure whether that 
means a sequence of explosions, 
each more violent than the 
last — or if the sun's output will go 
on rising asymptotically — " 

"It won’t make any difference, 
skipper, unless one alternative 
gives the ship more time,” said 
Slazeck. “And the only people who 
could brief us on what has gone 
before have had the good sense to 
gel out of here." 

“We'll do likewise,” said 
McKay. “RLV to ground party. 



we are approaching the city now. 
Stand by for immediate pickup.” 

G REAT bolts of lightning were 
splitting the sky but the com- 
puter translation freed the reply of 
interference. “We are not in 
immediate danger. Please first 
rescue our colleagues in the heart 
of the city.” 

Now what? “Explain, please.” 
The RLV was coming down 
through reddish storm-clouds, 
with only glimpses of the dark- 
ened city ahead. 

“There are only two of us at this 
point — we had come down from 
the satellite to retrieve the others 
and were maneuvering to land on 
a rooftop when the storm came. 
The shuttle was not built for such 
conditions and we crashed in the 
seaward part of the city. We have 
protective suits, but our friends in 
the city have been forced to shelter 
from the growing heat 

"I thought we were having it too 
easy,” McKay commented. “How 
can we locate them?" 

“There is a marker on the roof 
of the building. When we heard 
last, they were retreating below 
street level.” 

“As long as the marker hasn't 
blown away — ” said McKay as 
they began their run across the city. 
“Our sensors are good but they 
won’t penetrate solid stone.” 

Close up, the age of the city was 
obvious. The buildings were 
shells, many of them in advanced 



HERE COMES THE SUN 



177 




ruin. Some ground disturb- 
ance — it didn't look recent — had 
split off the city’s seaward sec- 
tion, lowering it below sea level, 
leaving only a welter of white water 
within the old sea wall. Toward the 
land, where a few towers were still 
standing in the spray, the sensors 
pinpointed the partly submerged 
wreck of the Furtherance shuttle. 
Beyond the foaming water in the 
fissure, the rest of the city was 
coming down in the storm: the 
streets were filled with flying dust. 

To McKay's relief, the RLV 
found the rescue marker on the 
first pass. 

“Now all we have to do is get 
down there. 

Fie pulled the ship up into 
slightly calmer air. 

“We can’t set down in that, for 
sure,’’ Devlin agreed. “We’d be 
blown into something before even 
this autopilot could correct.” 

“We'll have to get down fast and 
we'll probably need the rockets to 
get back up again.” 

He hovered at a safe height until 
the wind’s fury began to abate. The 
tension remained with him, not 
growing, but bigger in his aware- 
ness than the outside situation it- 
self. Little by little the clouds lifted, 
the scene lightened; the air over 
the city began to clear as the dust 
fell into eddying swathes. The 
street he had picked out for the 
touchdown was practically clear 
when he brought the ship in. The 
wind was still high, but the VTOL 



jets could cope with it now. He 
slowed the descent, almost hover- 
ing as the landing blocks went 
down. 

“That roadway’s liquid ," Devlin 
said. “We can’t get across that 
without an air-cushion." 

One of the RLV's strongest de- 
sign points, McKay had often 
thought, was that it could float or 
taxi on its pads without utilizing 
its main engines. He was never 
more glad of this feature than 
right now, as he cut the jets and left 
the ship floating above the molten 
road. 

“Outside temperature’s one- 
eighty Fahrenheit and still ris- 
ing,” he said. “We’re going to need 
armor." 

“We’re going out?" 

"How do you expect them to 
know we're here? They'll be under- 
ground. And how would they make 
it to the ship? We have to ta.ke suits 
to them. You and I, Devlin. Sla- 
zeck slays here to mind the store." 

The protective suits that went 
with the RLV were not wholly suit- 
able for this situation. They 
reflected heal, certainly, but that 
was because they were built to re- 
flect laser beams and bul- 
lets another reminder of the kind 
of rescue mission the Sasarenn 
had had in mind. For the present 
situation they were over-protec- 
tive, a good deal too heavy. 

“Problem, Mac," said Devlin as 
he finished suiting up. 

“Which one?" 



178 



GALAXY 




“Two of us, four of them, only 
four suits.” 

“We'll have to take in two 
stretcher units. They can carry the 
suits we do have and float us across 
that road." 

M CKAY had absolutely no 
quarrel with the design of the 
stretcher unit, which he thought 
was a masterpiece. For rocket 
maneuvers acceleration shields 
could be closed around the RLV’s 
G-couches. The same unit, sepa- 
rated from the ship's power and 
life-support systems, could be 
launched as an escape capsule. 
Released at ground level, it be- 
came an air-cushion stretcher or 
sled, maneuvered by air jets and 
you passed it straight back into the 
RLV cabin through the escape 
hatch, without having to gel your 
casualty through airlock decon- 
tamination. If you wanted to take 
a miniature cannon along the unit 
became a highly effective gun car- 
riage. 

Slazeck guided two such units to 
where McKay and Devlin were 
waiting in the open airlock. 
Standing on the ramp/door, the 
two men loaded the empty suits, 
stepped carefully down after 
them and floated across the road- 
way toward the building. 

Ash and dust swirled under the 
stretchers as they crossed the last 
strip of ground before the en- 
trance, passing statues of the old 
inhabitants presumably. The 



sculptures might have been of 
animals —they might have been of 
gods- the last hot peak in the 
star’s output had thawed them 
down into twisted, unrecognizable 
blobs. 

Something had awakened here, 
McKay thought. His tensions 
were seeking personification. 
Some old deity, Wordsworth's 
something far more deeply inter- 
fused Whose dwelling is the light 
of setting suns . had come to 
walk the deserted streets and the 
touch of the dying sun had driven 
the statues mad. As if to add ter- 
ror to the thought, the sun itself 
came out from the trailing edge of 
the cloud and glared at him. 

He could feel the heat of it even 
through his armor. He called the 
RLV: “What’s the output now?” 

“Up fifty percent since we 
arrived, Mac." 

Devlin muttered, “Let’s get out 
of here." 

They steered the air-sleds into 
the relative darkness of the build- 
ing, looking for the refugees’ route 
in the thick dust. On top of weather 
damage, the whole place wore a 
scorched, glazed look, the halls 
hollowed out by fire and heat in 
successive pulses of the sun out- 
side. 

It's all going next time, McKay 
thought. There'll be a hot time in 
the old town tonight. Will we still 
be here when it all burns down? 

McKay spoke into his suit mike: 
“Hello, hello can you hear us?” 



HERE COMESTHE SUN 



179 




They found footprints leading 
down one of the ramps and fol- 
lowed them down till one slope was 
too much for the stretchers. The 
increasing heat had forced the 
Furtherance team deeper and 
deeper, farther from radio contact 
and rescue. McKay and Devlin 
came upon stranded ETs three 
floors below street level, ex- 
hausted and semi-conscious. 

The Fallaran were from a high- 
gravity planet; short and power- 
fully muscled, they were still rela- 
tively lightweight. Once into the 
suits, two of- them partly 
revived with their thick skins, the 
ETs had found the increasing heat 
a real problem. Getting the other 
two to the stretchers and safely 
shielded took longer; the aliens 
would ordinarily have found the 
suits no burden, but now they were 
too weak to be much help. 

“Just as well we didn't bring 
stretchers for everyone," Devlin 
commented when at last they were 
ready to head back. 

As they moved toward the sur- 
face, there was a crash of falling 
stone in the dark behind them. 
Dust lifted from the floor and 
danced before their torches. “This 
whole place is ready to come 
down," said McKay. “We must be 
out of here before the storm hits 
again." 

White sunlight was still striking 
into the entrance hall as they came 
back — and under it, the floor was 
smoking. Beyond the doorway 



was a landscape of hell: the road- 
way itself was burning, great 
sheets of yellow (lame rolling on it 
and the RLV was immersed in 
thick black smoke. Peering down 
the street, McKay could see the 
new storm front coming up from 
the sea. 

“Bring the ship to us, Walt, 
before that weather gets here - “ 

H E DID use the takeoff rockets 
to get back above rooftop 
height, since the storm was only 
minutes away. The sun's radia- 
tion output was now three limes 
what it had been when they 
arrived — McKay imagined the 
Earth falling vertically toward 
the sun, passing the orbit of Venus 
and still accelerating. Whether the 
heat would climb ever more steeply 
or go up explosively, McKay 
thought, it would outpace the 
Rl.V's refrigeration before long. 

lie had seven people in a ship 
built to carry only six as he turned 
back toward the sea. All the 
couches were filled and Devlin was 
in the airlock, standing by to pick 
up the pilots. One of them could 
squeeze into the back of the cabin, 
the other two would have to ride in 
the lock. 

“We aren’t going to make this, 
Mac," said Slazeck. Already the 
storm front was towering over the 
city. 

“Get back into the cabin, Dev, " 
McKay ordered as he approached 
the seaward blocks, converting 



180 



GALAXY 




again to VTOL thrust. “I'll puf 
down the lines from here. We must 
get you aboard," he radioed to the 
pilots, “before that storm hits." 

He saw them start across the 
roof, small figures clumsy in their 
metallic armor. Sighting with the 
ship’s perception, he fired the air- 
lock lines to them. One caught his 
and was raised to the airlock in 
seconds by the high-speed winch; 
the other line was blown across the 
roof. The pilot almost had it when 
the storm struck. 

The RLV lifted bodily, jets 
screaming for control -the line 
was whipped away and the 
Furtherance pilot stumbled and 
was blown over the edge. McKay 
glimpsed him, a tiny bright figure, 
tumbling into the tumult of water 
surrounding the building then 
rain and spray blotted out every- 
thing. 

The RLV was being carried 
blindly into the crumbling towers 
of the city. The computer had the 
command decision; McKay con- 
centrated on tidying up dropping 
the lines, closing the lock, flood- 
ing lock and rear cabin with accel- 
eration foam as the autopilot 
hauled the nose of the ship around 
to the vertical and fired the fusion 
sustainer motor. The blue star of 
the flame cut through the storm, 
reflecting back from the disinte- 
grating faces of the buildings, as 
the ship leaped upward and out of 
danger. 

Back in the fierce eye of the sun, 



McKay cut the rocket and switched 
to ramjet thrust, leveling out. “1 
am deeply sorry for the death of 
your friend," he told the Further- 
ance team. “The Interface relay 
will be back above the horizon in a 
lew minutes and we shall escape 
from this place." 

“All but one are safe," said the 
computer translation. “It is more 
than we could have hoped for.” 

They continued to gain height, 
waiting for the satellite. Storm 
clouds and flying dust obscured 
all the land below. “I have set 
Interface for a direct transfer to 
the Earth satellite," McKay went 
on, to make conversation. “From 
there we can take you to our base 
to recover." 

“We thank you. However the 
hospitality of your satellite will 
suffice." 

McKay understood. For all their 
pride, in their self-appointed task, 
the Furtherance people were 
extremely sensitive and would 
lake this accident very much to 
heart. 

Minutes passed. 

“Where,” McKay exclaimed al 
last, “is that damned satellite?" 

H E HAD been trusting too much 
to the RLV’s refined systems. 
He had selected perception cir- 
cuits to report acquisition of the 
satellite, as ordered; so they had 
not fed him the roar of solar inter- 
ference he now discovered filled 
the Interface waveband. 



HERE COMESTHE SUN 



181 




Everyone in the ship, plugged in, 
shared his finding, except for the 
two still immersed in acceleration 
foam. McKay didn’t wait to ex- 
plain to them. He said, as the com- 
puter beat out a rendezvous tra- 
jectory, “I’m sorry, those of you 
without couches, but we are going 
back on rocket acceleration. 
Three-second warning, primary 
boost.” The nose of the ship lifted, 
the air intakes closed and flame to 
rival the sun’s split the sky behind 
them. 

“Will the satellite still be there, 
Mac?” Devlin asked as they raced 
upward. 

“It had better be,” said McKay. 



“I’m going for a rendezvous on 
the dark side, in hopes we can 
make contact before we reach it. 
Damn thing has a normal range of 
ten thousand miles, after all." 

Entering the stratosphere, 
McKay switched up to secondary 
boost as soon as he dared. It was 
dangerous to run the fusion motor 
at full power to the ground, though 
in this case damage to the ground 
scarcely mattered; but with the 
ship one-third overloaded, a fast 
transfer would eat fuel. The ship 
curved up into space, away from 
the brilliant sun which seemed, 
with its increasing heat, to be 
following them.

With the motors off, they 
coasted silently along the transfer 
orbit toward nightfall. McKay 
had the RLV's search parabola 
extended, beaming a contact 
signal toward the satellite —he still 
caught only interference. There 
was time now to wonder about the 
former inhabitants of Tessar and 
time to ask questions***but his 
curiosity was gone. McKay was 
watching the sun as the RLV 
dimmed its vision circuits con- 
stantly to keep it in view. If it was 
not going to explode, how hot did 
it have to get before the photo- 
sphere began to stream off? 

The RIV rounded Tessar and the 
sun set like blood streaming in the 
firmament. The horses of the night 
were out all right, great streamers 
of aurora shifting over the dark 
face of the planet, their move- 
ments matching the shrieks and 
howls of interference. Spirits of 
the dead, as in Earth’s legends? All 
the ghosts of Tessar’s history, 
come out for the final burn-up? 
They were slow and beautiful, if 
you could watch them with detach- 
ment. 

“That interference is getting 
worse,” Slazeck pointed out quiet- 
ly- 

“I’m hoping for a lull in a few 
minutes,” said McKay. “We’re 
skirting a shock wave of charged 
particles trapped by Tessar’s 
magnetic field. There should be a 
pronounced ‘tail’ on the dark side 
from so strong a solar wind, and 



I’ve aimed for us to close with the 
satellite where the radiation belt 
is attenuated." We should make 
it, he thought, given a few more 
minutes. Only one thing could pre- 
vent it now, the sun's premature 
reappearance around the planet 
all round it. 

The computer display con- 
firmed his forecast, Incident 
radiation on the hull began to drop 
as they cut across the distorted 
radiation belts. The interference 
was decreasing in the magnetic 
lee of the planet — and suddenly 
they had contact with the satellite. 

“Up Interface — ” 

Again, no visual spectacle: only 
the confirmation of the instru- 
ments that there was an Interface 
there. But as they moved towards it 
the black starry disc bit into the 
Milky Way, then into the pale, 
streaked face of Tessar. Earth’s 
heavens look over and the invisible 
disc behind them, still not filled 
with the fires of the exploding star, 
snapped shut. 

They were, as arranged, riding 
in orbit high above the Earth with 
the space station, just going into 
shadow. The sun was slowly 
vanishing behind the planet a 
peaceful setting for the recuperat- 
ing scientists. The sun dwindled, 
to be reborn in due course on the 
opposite horizon. But, watching 
the reddened disc tearing at the 
edge of the world, McKay won- 
dered how long it would be before 
he was at ease in sunlight again. ★

Something went wrong with the 
subway that night. Of course, in 
New York City not even those di- 
rectly affected noticed, the capaci- 
ty for urban disaster having reach- 
ed its fullest extremes in that well- 
known tourist attraction. 

A 

E DWARD got on the IRT down- 
town local at 42nd Street for 
Greenwich Village. The train 
stopped at 33rd Street, 27th Street, 
17th Street and Christopher Circle. 
As it turned out he met his wife at 
this party. 

It was a standard, Greenwich 
Village all-of-us-are damned gath- 
ering. She was sitting in a corner 
of the room, her feet hare, listening 
to a man with sad mustaches play 
a mandolin. Edward went over to 
say hello to her. She looked at him 
with vague disinterest and huddled 
closer to the mandolin player, who 
turned out -on further inspection 
to be her date for the night. But 
Edward was persistent his par- 
ents had always told him that his 
fearfulness was his chief detracting 
characteristic and later that night 
he got her address. 

Two days later he showed up 
with a shopping cart filled with 
gourmet food and asked her if she 
would help him eat it. She shrugged 
and introduced him to her cats. 
Three weeks later they slept with 
one another for the first time and 
the week after that the mandolin 



player and he had a fight, at the 
end of which the mandolin player 
wished them well and left her flat 
forever. Edward and Julie were en- 
gaged only a few days after that 
and during the month he married 
her in Elktown. 

They went back to New York 
and started life together. He gave 
up mathematics, of course, and be- 
came an accountant. She gave up 
painting and took to going to an- 
tique shops once a week, bringing 
back objects every now and then. 
It was not a bad life, even if it had 
started out, perhaps, a bit on the 
contrived side. 

Three years later Edward opened 
the door and found Julie playing 
with their year-old daughter, shak- 
ing a rattle and putting it deep into 
the baby's mouth. The scene was a 
pleasing one and he felt quite con- 
tented until she looked up at him 
and he saw that she was crying. 

He put down his briefcase and 
asked her what was wrong. She 
told him that their life had been an 
utter waste. Everything she wanted 
she had not gotten — everything 
that she had gotten she did not 
want. She was surrounded by 
things, she told him, she had pre- 
pared herself as a child to despise. 
And the worst of it was that all of 
it was her own fault. She talked of 
divorce but only by inference. 

Realizing that the fault was all 
his, Edward said that he would 
check up on some suburbs, get 
them a nice-sized house and some 



GEHENNA

activities for her during the day. 
And so he did — all of it and they 
were very happy for a while if 
gravely in debt -until he came 
home from the circus one night 
with his daughter and found that 
Julie, feet bare, had drowned her- 
self in the bathtub. 

B 

J ULIE got on the 1RT down- 
town local at 42nd Street for 
Greenwich Village. The train 
stopped at 32nd Street, 24th Street, 
13th Street and the Statue of 
Christ. As it turned out, she met 
her husband at this party. It was a 
standard Greenwich Village we- 
are-finding-ourselves party and he 
came in late, dressed all wrong, his 
hands stretching his pockets out of 
shape. He was already very drunk. 

She was there with a boy named 
Vincent who meant little to her 
but who played the mandolin beau- 
tifully and sang her love songs. If 
the songs were derivative and the 
motions a trifle forced — well, it 
was a bad period for both <bf them 
and she took what comfort she 
could. But when her husband-to-be 
came over and spoke to her-^his 
name was Edward as it turned out 
she could see beyond his embar- 
rassment and her misery that a cer- 
tain period of her life and of the 
mandolin-player’s was over. He 
wanted her telephone number but 
because she didn’t believe in tele- 
phones she gave him her address 



instead while Vincent was off 
changing his clothes. She told him 
that she was very unsure of herself. 

Three days later, while she was 
still in bed, he came with flowers 
and candy and told her that he 
could not forget her. With a smile 
she invited hm in and the first time 
was very good belter than it had 
been with Vincent, anyway. Ed- 
ward was gone when Vincent came 
later that evening and she told him 
that she had been lusting after the 
sea all her life- now she at least, 
had found a pond. Then she told 
him what she and Edward had 
done. He wept and cursed her. He 
told her that she had betrayed ev- 
erything of importance, the small 
reality they had built together but 
she was firm. She said that lines 
must be drawn for once and for all 
between the present and the pos- 
sible. 

Alter that she saw nothing of 
either Vincent or Edward for a 
week. Then Edward came with a 
suitcase. He said he had moved out 
of his parents’ home and had come 
to marry her. She did not marry 
him right away but they lived to- 
gether for some weeks- one eve- 
ning she found a note in her mail- 
box, just like that, saying that Vin- 
cent had committed suicide. 

She never found out who had 
sent the note and she never told 
Edward anything. But a week lat- 
er they were married in Yonkers 
and went to a resort upstate, where 
they were happy for a few days.

They came back and bought fur- 
niture for her flat. He dropped out 
of astronomy and became an in- 
dustrial research assistant -or 
something like that. 

For a long time her days were 
simple they were, as a matter of 
fact, exactly like the days she had 
known just before she met Ed- 
ward- and the nights were good, 
pretty good anyway. Then she be- 
came pregnant in a difficult sort 
of way and eventually the child, 
Ann, was born - a perfect child 
with small hands and a musical 
capability. Edward said that they 
would have to find a real home 
now— he was very proud -but she 
said that the old life could keep up, 
at least until Ann was ready for 
school. But one night he came 
home early, very excited and just 
like that told her that he had 
found them a home in the suburbs. 
She told him that this was fine. He 
said that he was very happy, and 
she said the same. 

They moved to the suburbs and 
were content for a while, what with 
car pools and bridge and whatnot, 
as well as good playmates and a 
healthy environment for Ann. But 
Edward, for no reason, began to 
gel more and more depressed and 
one morning when she awoke to 
find his bed empty, she went into 
the bathroom to find him slumped 
over the bathtub, his wrists open, 
blood all over the floor, a faint, 
fishlike look of appeal in his 
stunned and disbelieving eyes. 



c 

V INCENT got on the IRT 
downtown local at 42nd Street 
for Greenwich Village. The train 
slopped at 37th street, 3 1st Street, 
19th Street and Christ Towers. As 
it turned out, he lost his girl at this 
party. It was a standard Green- 
wich Village look-how-liberaled- 
we-are kind of party and it was a 
strange thing that the two of them 
went separately since the 42nd 
Street stop was the nearest to both 
of their apartments. But she be- 
lieved in maintaining her privacy in 
small, damning ways. 

She was sad that night, sad with 
a misery he could not touch, much 
less comprehend. It had been a 
good time for both of them -they 
had been going together for the 
four months since she broke off 
with his closest friend and he 
played her songs on his mandolin 
promises of lost and terrible 
loves, promises of a belter future, 
songs of freedom and loneliness; 
and she loved his mandolin. She 
told him that she found her whole 
soul in his music. 

So he was playing songs for her 
at the party this night, not even 
wanting to be there, hoping that 
they could go back to her Hat and 
put the mandolin beside the bed 
and make their kind of love, when 
he saw that she was looking at an- 
other man in the corner of the 
room — a man of a different sort 
from the rest of them, since he was 



GEHENNA 



187 




the only one who was not already 
drunk. The man was looking back 
at her and in that moment Vincent 
knew that he was quite doomed, 
that he and Julie were quite fin- 
ished. 

To prove it to himself he left his 
instrument on her knee and went 
to the bathroom. When he came 
back they sprang apart like assas- 
sins and he knew that the man had 
her address. There was nothing to 
do, of course, but to leave the par- 
ty and he helped her with her coat, 
put his mandolin over his shoul- 
der and led her down the stairs. 
Halfway to the street he told her 
that she had betrayed them. She 
did not answer, later murmured 
that she could not help herself, 
much less another person but she 
would make this night the best of 
all the nights that she had ever giv- 
en him. 

And so she did, all night and in- 
to the dawn while her. cat stroked 
the mandolin, making wooden 
sounds, rolling the instrument 
around and around on the floor. 
In the morning he left her — and 
took his clothing-^-and then he did 
not see her at all for a few days. 
When he came back there was a 
different look on her face and the 
man was in her bed, lying next to 
her. 

I le did not care — he had lost any 
capacity for surprise when she had 
come from his closest friend, brok- 
en enough to need him. He only 
wanted to meet the man named 



Edward (who might become his 
closest friend loo) but the man did 
not want any part of him at all and 
there was a very bad scene a. scene 
that ended only when Vincent 
knocked the man to the door and 
smashed him there to the floor. 

But he never saw her again, vic- 
tory or not. He had no need to 
everything that needed proof had 
been proven. But he thought of her 
often and many years later, when 
he killed himself by leaping from a 
stranger's penthouse, his last 
thought as he felt the dry wind and 
saw the street coming at him was 
of his old mandolin, her solemn 
cat and the night she had given him 
her best because she had already 
partaken of his worst. 

D 

Hi: CHll.I) ANN who had 
very sensitive and gentle hands 
became a young woman who was 
drawn at odd moments to the win- 
dows of pawn shops in which she 
saw old mandolins - and once, lor 
a week, she took flute lessons. But 
she had no money and less pa- 
tience- that last was her biggest 
fault, along with a lack of assert- 
iveness and she dropped them. 

Now she is going to a parly in 
Greenwich Village. She does not 
know what will happen to her. The 
night is still a mystery. She is still 
young enough to scent possibilities

stance. You can get just as dead 
drinking too much spring water as 
you can by taking too much 
strychnine. The operative phrase is 
“too much.") Explicitness to any 
degree is perfectly okay as long as 
it functions in the larger structure 
of the story, but when it's done for 
its own sake it becomes analogous 
to the story of a banquet during 
which the diner obsessively, repeat- 
edly, endlessly returns to the lima 
beans. Now that the wall is broken, 
it says nothing for a writer's cour- 
age or intelligence to spend his 
lime kicking the broken bricks 
around. 

For there are other battles to 
fight. 

Alter sex what? 

F IRST of all. let us realize that 
in a strange and wonderful way 
we are all now at the frontiers of a 
new after-sex Afterward, in the 
largest sense. We can begin to 
accept one another's sexuality as a 
facet of the whole person -and 
learn more about the whole person. 
When we do this we might begin 
on some of the other problems we 
have. Ecology, for example, needs 



( Continued from page 4) 

to be made functional rather than 
fashionable. You have to qualify 
to be able to vote, don't you? Then 
set yourself a rigid set of qualifi- 
cations and abide by them before 
you open your mouth to say one 
word about oil spills or smog. Quit 
littering, even by so much as a 
match. Learn such details as that 
many tints used on paper towels 
are not biodegradable, though the 
paper itself may be. Find out how 
to recycle your bottles and cans 
rather than discarding them, and 
then really do it, all the lime. Then 
holler about the raw sewage 
upstream; it will make you feel 
really good. Actually, Julian Flux- 
ley wrote forty years ago that all 
education — mathematics, history, 
everything— should be taught 
from an ecological basis from 
kindergarten on up. Now that's 
something to shoot for. Sexually 
repressed, our species, though 
sick, might survive for thousands 
of years, but unless we clean up 
our spaceship we’ve got only a few 
dozens. 

And here's another- something 
I’ve been trying for a long time to 
reduce to bumper-sticker size. 



189 




There is an inexplicable blindness 
in the Establishment and I mean 
every establishment for the last 
seventeen thousand years mini- 
mum which makes it believe that 
if you can instill enough fear you 
will eliminate anger. Despite 
repeated proof empires over- 
thrown, Caesar stabbed, indepen- 
dence declared, juntas formed 
the powers-thal-be still seem to 
feel that more laws, more police, 
more repression, more restriction 
will in some way slop the people 
from becoming angry. It is my 
firm conviction that the flame that 
burned that body in the bunker in 
Berlin was kindled in Coventry by 
Hiller himself. Early in the war, 
riding high, the Germans bombed 
Coventry (not even a military tar- 
get) Oat into the ground. The idea 
was to scare the British so badly 
that they wouldn't light. It scared 
them, all right. It terrified them. It 
also made them so coldly and un- 
remittingly angry that' the fire 
burned the body and on the way 
created firestorms in Dresden and 
Hamburg that killed more people 
than the atom bombs 

The sense of my bumper-slicker, 
if 1 ever get it titrated down to few- 
enough words, is this: “You who 
rule, listen. Forget all the 
humanitarian glop; you don't be- 
lieve in it anyway. But in your own 
self-interest, make yourself 
understand the simple fact that 
scared people get angry, and when 
enough of them get angry enough 



they'll have your head. What 
you're doing isn't the enforcement 
you think it is - it’s suicide." 

A government sans fear might 
have some weird and colorful ups 
and downs, but it stands a chance 
to last. Enough force, enough re- 
pression, and you have yourself 
another thousand-year (hah!) 
Reich. It seems so simple, doesn't 
it'.’ Yet they haven't learned, and 
the teaching presents at least as 
much of a challenge to writers and 
readers and thinkers as the right to 
scribble some gossip about a juicy 
incest. 

I 'LL give you just one more chal- 
lenge, to suggest an answer to 
"After sex what.’'' And this one 
is, I think, really comprehensible 
only to the si audience; you're 
geared to this kind of thinking. 

Some years ago someone (and 
if you'll tell me who. I'll be grate- 
ful) wrote a story about an alien 
who was captured by Terrans, who 
wanted to discover if he was intel- 
ligent and if so, in what ways and 
how much. So they constructed a 
whi//er of a maze, with physical 
and psychological twists and turns, 
go-no-go problems, decision-mak- 
ing doorways, the vastly evolved 
equivalent of the long stick in 
short pieces that psychologists put 
in chimp cages, to see if they can 
screw it together to get the 
bananas the works. So they shove 
this ET into the maze and sit back 
to watch, and he goes zip, twist, 



190 



GALAXY 




jump, skid, zang, whump through 
the whole thing in about one-third 
the time it would take the guy who 
designed it. Whereupon he just 
sat. And everybody says wow, let's 
call up more people; they’ve got to 
get a load of this over at Opera- 
tions. So with a new larger 
audience they put the alien in the 
starting gate again and say Go. 
Only he doesn’t go. He just sits 
there. They prod him a lot but 
nothing works; he just sits there. 
Well, the twist is that he’s so 
damned intelligent that he recog- 
nizes the maze for what it is, and 
demonstrates that he can solve it, 
but it just isn’t in him to under- 
stand why, having made the 
demonstration, it would be 
necessary to do it again. 

All right: human beings are 
capable of learning simple 
concepts. Some concepts, how- 
ever, are (for humans) so obscure 
that the only way to get them to 
understand is to elaborate, to 
candy-coat, to create suspense and 
continuity around them and 
gradually, while bringing in a huge 
emotional quantum, reveal the 
underlying truth otherwise we 
just won’t buy it. Shakespeare's 
Hamlet, Heller’s Catch-22, Mil- 
ler's Death of a Salesman are 
towering masterpieces, but each 
one of them has a point to make 
(and it’s a beauty) which could be 
stated in a single declarative 
sentence. However, that single sen- 
tence won’t do for human beings; 



they have to have the whole megil- 
lah. Only a small fraction of the 
population gets to see towering 
masterpieces, and of those, only a 
few grasp the simple insight. This 
is so true of so many of us that we 
have never recognized it as a prob- 
lem, as a racial defect; but it is, and 
one of the first magnitude. As far 
as 1 know, no one has ever recog- 
nized this obtuseness for what it is, 
nor given it a name, nor regarded 
it as the opaque cataract it is over 
the human vision. But the prob- 
lem-solving ET, landed on this 
planet, would walk around in abso- 
lute astonishment as truth after 
truth, fact after fact, simple solu- 
tion after simple solution appeared 
to us everywhere, only to be ig- 
nored unless wrapped up in some 
huge dramatic experience -and 
even then, ignored by all but a very 
few. The intelligent ET would have 
a right to ask why is it that we 
can’t pul up a billboard saying: 

DO UNTO OTHERS AS YE 

WOULD HAVE THEM DO 
UNTO YOU 

and immediately change the face of 
the earth. 

Why can’t we? Is the billboard 
hard to understand? If we lived by 
it, is it difficult to comprehend 
how the world would change, and 
in what ways? 

Ask yourself that some lime af- 
ter sex. 1 beg you - keep on asking 
until you find an answer. ★
