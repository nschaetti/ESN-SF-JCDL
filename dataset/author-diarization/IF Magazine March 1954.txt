A CHAT WITH 
THE EDITOR 

ALGAE, as you probably know, 
are the lowest form of plant life. 
Often single-celled, they some- 
times have leaflike and stemlike 
parts, but no true leaves and stems. 
Seaweed, kelp and similar aquatic 
gunk are actually the cities, towns 
and county fairs of algae. 

The time may come, and in the 
fairly near future at that, when 
you’ll walk into a restaurant and 
ask the waiter for an order of roast 
algae, with a side of French fried 
yeast. 

The reasons for this are many. 
People don’t multiply as fast as rab- 
bits, but they’re beginning to get 
the idea. The population of the 
United States hit 160,000,000 
around the middle of last year, and 
you can expect to be rubbing elbows 
with 190,000,000 in a couple of 
decades. Arable land, on the other 
hand, is definitely going down the 
drain. Much of it has been ruined 



by sheer carelessness in the past and 
won’t be useful again for a long 
time. Other sections are being en- 
croached upon by industry, hous- 
ing, damsites, bombsites, race 
tracks, and plain old erosion. 

It’s improbable that man, stub- 
born beast that he is, will just give 
up and fade away. And we can’t 
look to colonization of or imports 
from other planets just yet, al- 
though the possibility of a Iend- 
lease arrangement with the rest of 
the solar system remains an even- 
tual possibility to anyone with scien- 
tific imagination. We’ll have to turn 
to other sources of food right here 
at home if we’re going to survive. 

HYDROPONIC farming is one pos- 
sibility that has been described fair- 
ly frequently and will undoubtedly 
be helpful. Wider use of fish and 
other denizens of the deep, which 
remains relatively unspoiled by hu- 
man hands and gratifyingly large, 
is also on the list. Both of these, of 
course, are modifications or exten- 
sions of familiar processes; the blue- 
plate specials we get from them will 
be easily recognizable. Large econ- 
omy-sized fruits, vegetables and 
fish may become the rule, so that 
one brussels sprout, a piece hacked 
off a huge tomato, and a steak from 
a giant octopus will comprise a full 
meal — but the taste and appear- 
ance won’t be otherwise alien. 

Algae are something else again, 
and exactly what form they’ll take 
by the time they reach your dinner 
table is unpredictable. But they’re 
definitely on the way there. 

In the vanguard of this impor- 
tant work is the Department of 
Plant Biology (located in Califor- 




nia) of the Carnegie Institute of 
Washington. This group has 
studied the mechanism of photo- 
synthesis, by which plants use sun- 
light for growth, with single-celled 
algae as guinea pigs. They’ve been 
considering the mass culture of al- 
gae as a potential food source since 
before Word War II. 

Now the program has advanced 
to the level of actual engineering 
studies. Under Carnegie’s direction, 
Arthur D. Little, Inc., a firm fa- 
mous in many branches of research, 
engineering and technical econo- 
mics, has built and is operating a 
pilot plant on a larger scale than 
was previously possible. Little’s re- 
searchers have concentrated on 
Chlorella pyrenoidosa, a well- 
known and easily available green 
algae, and the results have been 
very hopeful indeed. 

In this pilot plant operation, 
Chlorella and water were pumped 
through a transparent plastice tube, 
which exposed 600 square feet of 
the stuff to sunlight at one time. 
Inorganic salts were fed in as nu- 
trients, and air enriched with car- 
bon dioxide was also passed con- 
tinuously through the tube. After 
this had gone on for three months, 
the scientists found themselves with 
a pile of 80 pounds of fresh, dry 
Chlorella on their hands and a 
good deal of new and useful in- 
formation in their notebooks. 

One of the most important dis- 
coveries was the nutritional value 
of dry Chlorella: it contains about 
50 per cent protein, up to 20 per 
cent fats, and most of the natural 
vitamins necessary to human 
health! All of which makes it just 
about equal to yeast as a food. 



This is highly significant, casting 
as it does a ray of hope that human- 
ity won’t have to tighten its collec- 
tive belt quite so far after all. As 
usual, of course, there’s a joker in 
the deck — the high cost of algae. 
Original investment in the equip- 
ment necessary to grow Chlorella 
runs to over $30,000 per acre. And 
even though one acre of culture 
should produce 25 to 35 tons of dry 
product annually — which ought to 
provide for a fair-sized family even 
assuming that the in-laws drop in 
for Sunday dinner- — the production 
cost would be about two and one- 
half times that of comparable vege- 
table products today. If we reach 
the stage where there just aren’t 
any comparable vegetable products 
to be had any more, this isn’t likely 
to deter us much, but that’s taking 
the dim view all around. Actually, 
there is good reason to hope that a 
substantial reduction in both ori- 
ginal cost and upkeep can be 
brought about by use of a simpler 
system. 

RIGHT NOW, an interesting pro- 
ject is going on in Japan, at the 
Tokugawa Institute for Biological 
Research in Tokyo. Several food 
products fortified with Chlorella 
have been made, cooked, salted and 
peppered, and — yes! — eaten there 
on a small scale. The Institute’s 
news releases haven’t mentioned 
how Chlorella sandwiches taste 
(and they add the reservation that 
the average Japanese diet contains 
similar materials to begin with), 
but they do take a generally opti- 
mistic attitude. At the very least, 
Chlorella may be used within the 
( Continued on page 100)

All Earth needed was a good stiff dose of common sense, but its 
rulers preferred to depend on the highly fallible computers in- 
stead. As a consequence, interplanetary diplomatic relations 
were somewhat strained — until a nimble-witted young man 
from Mars came up with the answer to the “sixty-four dollar ” 
question. 



THE 

AMBASSADOR 



By Sam Merwin, Jr. 

Illustrated by Kelly Freas 



Z ALEN LINDSAY stood on the 
rostrum in the huge new United 
Worlds auditorium on the shore of 
Lake Pontchartrain and looked out 
at an ocean of eyeglasses. Individu- 
ally they ranged in hue from the 
rose-tinted spectacles of the Ameri- 
cans to the dark brown of the Soviet 
bloc. Their shapes and adornments 
were legion: round, harlequin, dia- 
mond, rhomboid, octagonal, square, 
oval; rimless, gem-studded, horn- 
rimmed, floral-rimmed, rimmed in 
the cases of some of the lady repre- 
sentatives with immense artificial 
eyelashes. 

The total effect, to Lindsay, was 
of looking at an immense page of 
printed matter composed entirely 



of punctuation marks. Unspec- 
tacled, he felt like a man from 
Mars. He was a man from Mars — 
first Martian Ambassador Plenipo- 
tentiary to the Second United 
Worlds Congress. 

He wished he could see some of 
the eyes behind the protective gog- 
gles, for he knew he was making 
them blink. 

He glanced down at the tele- 
prompter in front of him — purely 
to add effect to a pause, for he had 
memorized his speech and was de- 
livering it without notes. On it was 
printed: HEY, BOSS— DON’T 

FORGET YOU GOT A DINNER 
DATE WITH THE SEC-GEN 
TONIGHT.

SAM MERWIN, JR. 



Lindsay suppressed. a smile and 
said, “In conclusion, I am qualified 
by the governors of Mars to prom- 
ise that if we receive another ship- 
ment of British hunting boots we 
shall destroy them immediately 
upon unloading — and refuse cate- 
gorically to ship further beryllium 
to Earth. 

“On Mars we raise animals for 
food, not for sport — we consider 
human beings as the only fit ath- 
letic competition for other humans 
— and we see small purpose in ex- 
pending our resources mining 
beryllium or other metals for pay- 
ment that is worse than worthless. 
In short, we will not be a dumping 
ground for Earth’s surplus goods. I 
thank you.” 

The faint echo of his words came 
back to him as he stepped down 
from the rostrum and walked slow- 
ly to his solitary seat in the other- 
wise empty section allotted to rep- 
resentatives of alien planets. Other- 
wise there was no sound in the huge 
assemblage. 

He felt a tremendous lift of ten- 
sion, the joyousness of a man who 
has satisfied a lifelong yearning to 
toss a brick through a plate-glass 
window and knows he will be ar- 
rested for it and doesn’t care. 

There was going to be hell to 
pay — and Lindsay was honestly 
looking forward to it. While Sec- 
retary General Carlo Bergozza, his 
dark-green spectacles resembling 
parenthesis marks on either side of 
his thin eagle beak, went through 
the motions of adjourning the Con- 
gress for forty-eight hours, Lindsay 
considered his mission and its pur- 
pose. 

Earth — a planet whose age-old 



feuds had been largely vitiated by 
the increasing rule of computer- 
judgment — and Mars, the one set- 
tled alien planet on which no com- 
puter had ever been built, were 
drifting dangerously apart. 

It was, Lindsay thought with a 
trace of grimness, the same ancient 
story of the mother country and 
her overseas colonies, the same 
basic and seemingly inevitable 
trend, social and economic, that 
had led to the revolt of North 
America against England, three 
hundred years earlier. 

On a far vaster and costlier scale, 
of course. 

Lindsay had been sent to Earth, 
as his planet’s first representative 
at the new United Worlds Con- 
gress, to see that this trend was 
halted before it led to irrevocable 
division. And not by allowing Mars 
to become a mere feeder and 
dumping ground for the parent 
planet. 

Well, he had tossed a monkey 
wrench into the machinery of inter- 
planetary sweetness and light, he 
thought. Making his way slowly 
out with the rest of the Congress, 
he felt like the proverbial bull in 
the china shop. The others, eyeing 
him inscrutably through their eye- 
glasses and over their harness 
humps, drew aside to let him walk 
through. 

But all around him, in countless 
national tongues, he heard the 
whispers, the mutterings — “sending 
a gladiator” . “looks like a vidar 
star” . “too young for such grave 
responsibility” . “no understand- 
ing of the basic sensitivities” . 

Obviously, he had not won a 
crushing vote of confidence. 




THE AMBASSADOR 



7 



T O HELL with them, all of 
them, he thought as someone 
tapped him on a shoulder. He 
turned to find du Fresne, the North 
American Minister of Computa- 
tion, peering up at him through 
spectacles that resembled twin 
scoops of strawberry ice-cream 
mounted in heavy white-metal 
rims. 

“I’d like a word with you,” he 
said, speaking English rather than 
Esperanto. Lindsay nodded polite- 
ly, thinking that du Fresne looked 
rather like a Daumier judge with 
his fashionable humped back and 
long official robe of office. 

Over a table in the twilight bar 
du Fresne leaned toward him, 
nearly upsetting his colafizz with a 
sleeve of his robe. 

“M-mind you,” he said, “this is 
strictly unofficial, Lindsay, but I 
have your interests at heart. You’re 
following trend X.” 

“Got me all nicely plotted out 
on your machine?” said Lindsay. 

Du Fresne’s sallow face went 
white at this pleasantry. As Min- 
ister of Computation his entire be- 
ing was wrapped up in the im- 
mensely intricate calculators that 
forecast all decisions for the huge 
North American republic. Ob- 
viously battling anger, he said, 
“Don’t laugh at Elsac, Lindsay. It 
has never been wrong — it can’t be 
wrong.” 

“I’m not laughing,” said Lindsay 
quietly. “But no one has ever fed 
me to a computer. So how can you 
know . ?” 

“We have fed it every possible 
combination of circumstances based 
upon all the facts of Terro-Mar- 
tian interhistory,” the Minister of 



Computation stated firmly. His 
nose wrinkled and seemed to turn 
visibly pink at the nostril-edges. He 
said, “Damn! I’m allergic to com- 
puter-ridicule.” He reached for an 
evapochief, blew his nose. 

“Sorry,” said Lindsay, feeling the 
mild amazement that seemed to ac- 
company all his dealings with 
Earthfolk. “I wasn’t — ” 

“I doe you weren’d,” du Fresne 
said thickly. “Bud de vurry zug- 
gedgeshun of ridicule dudz id.” He 
removed his strawberry spectacles, 
produced an eye-cup, removed and 
dried the contact lenses beneath. 
After he had replaced them his con- 
dition seemed improved. 

Lindsay offered him a cigarette, 
which was refused, and selected 
one for himself. He said, “What 
happens if I pursue trend X?” 
“You’ll be assassinated,” du 
Fresne told him nervously. “And 
the results of such assassination 
will be disastrous for both planets. 
Earth will have to go to war.” 
“Then why not ship us goods we 
can use?” Lindsay asked quietly. 

Du Fresne looked at him as de- 
spairingly as his glasses would per- 
mit. He said, “You just don’t un- 
derstand. Why didn’t your people 
send someone better attuned to our 
problems?” 

“Perhaps because they felt Mars 
would be better represented by 
someone attuned to its own prob- 
lems,” Lindsay told him. “Don’t tell 
me your precious computers rec- 
ommend murder and war.” 

“They don’t recommend any- 
thing,” said du Fresne. “They 
merely advise what will happen un- 
der given sets of conditions.” 
“Perhaps if you used sensible

judgment instead of machines to 
make your decisions you could pre- 
vent my assassination,” said Lind- 
say, finishing his scotch on the 
rocks. “Who knows?” he added. 
“You might even be able to pre- 
vent an interplanetary war!” 

When he left, du Fresne’s nose 
was again growing red and the 
Minister of Computation was fum- 
bling for another evapochief. 

n IDING the escaramp to his of- 
fice on the one-twentieth floor 
of the UW building, Lindsay pon- 
dered the strange people of the 
mother planet among whom his as- 
signment was causing him to live. 
One inch over six feet, he was not 
outstandingly tall — but he felt tall 
among them, with their slump har- 
nesses and disfiguring spectacles 
and the women so hidden beneath 
their shapeless coveralls and har- 
mopan makeup. 

He was not unprepared for the 
appearance of Earthfolk, of course, 
but he had not yet adjusted to see- 
ing them constantly around him 
in such large numbers. To him 
their deliberate distortion was as 
shocking as, he supposed wryly, his 
own unaltered naturalness was to 
them. 

There was still something illogi- 
cal about the cult of everyday ugli- 
ness that had overtaken the moth- 
er planet in the last two genera- 
tions, under the guise of social 
harmony. It dated back, of course, 
to the great Dr. Ludmilla Hartwig, 
psychiatric synthesizer of the final 
decades of the twentieth century. 

It was she who had correctly in- 
terpreted the growing distrust of 



the handsome and the beautiful 
among the great bulk of the less 
favored, the intense feelings of 
inferiority such comely persons 
aroused. It was from her computer- 
psychiatry that the answer em- 
ployed had come: since everyone 
cannot be beautiful, let all be ugly. 

This slogan had sparked the mass 
use of unneeded spectacles, the dis- 
tortion harnesses, the harmopan 
makeup. Now, outside of emergen- 
cies, it was as socially unacceptable 
for a man or woman to reveal a 
face uncovered in public as it had 
been, centuries earlier, for a Mos- 
lem odalisque to appear unveiled 
in the bazaar. 

There were exceptions, of course 
— aside from those who were nat- 
urally ugly to begin with. Vidar- 
screen actors and actresses were 
permitted to reveal beauty when 
their parts demanded it — which 
was usually only in villains’ roles. 
And among men, professional ath- 
letes were expected to show their 
faces and bodies au naturel as a 
mark of their profession. Among 
women the professional courtesans 
— -the “models”, not the two-credit 
whores — displayed their charms on 
all occasions. Beauty was bad busi- 
ness for lower-caste prostitutes — it 
made such clients they could pro- 
mote feel too inferior. 

These specialists, the models and 
gladiators, were something of a race 
apart, computer-picked in infancy 
and raised for their professions like 
Japanese sumo wrestlers. They 
were scarcely expected to enter the 
more sensitive realms of the arts, 
business affairs or government. 

It was, Lindsay decided, a hell 
of a state of affairs. 




THE AMBASSADOR 



9 



INA BECKWITH, Lindsay’s 
Earth-assigned personal secre- 
tary, was leaning far back in her 
tilt-chair with her feet on the desk. 
Her eyes were squinted behind 
chartreuse-tinted flat-oval lenses to 
avoid fumes from a cigarette stuck 
in a corner of her wide mouth. She 
had shut off the air-conditioner, 
opened the picture window and 
pulled the pants of her coverall far 
up above her knees to let the warm 
New Orleans September air wash 
over her skin. 

Lindsay looked at her legs with 
surprise— it had not occurred to 
him that Nina owned such a long 
and shapely pair. He whistled softly 
through his teeth. 

Nina removed her smoke, sighed 
and made a move to stand up and 
let her coverall fall back over the 
exposed limbs. Lindsay said, “Not 
on my account — please! Those are 
the first good looking legs I’ve seen 
since leaving Mars.” 

“Watch yourself, boss,” said Nina 
and indulged in a slow half-smile. 
Then, putting her feet back on the 
floor, “You certainly lost a lot of 
friends and disinfluenced a lot of 
people down there today. If you’d 
prepared your speech on the ma- 
chine I’d have fixed it up for you.” 
“Which is exactly why I pre- 
pared it in my hot little head,” 
Lindsay told her. “I wanted to 
knock some sense into them.” 

Nina got out of her chair and 
snuffed out her cigarette in the dis- 
posal tray, then sat on the edge of 
the desk and poked at the untidy 
dark-blonde hair she wore in a knot 
on top of her head. She said, 
“Night soil! You’ll never knock any 
sense into that mob.” 



Lindsay, who had been thinking 
wistfully that if Nina would only 
do something about that hair, the 
thickness of her middle, and her 
bilious complexion, she might be 
fairly good looking, blinked. He 
said, “Why in hell do you work for 
them then?” 

She shrugged disinterested shoul- 
ders, told him, “It’s a job.” She 
yawned, unabashed, added irrele- 
vantly, “You know, boss, the trou- 
ble with you is you look like a 
gladiator. They won’t take you 
seriously unless you wear specs and 
a harness.” 

“Over my dead body,” he told 
her. “What’s wrong with athletes 
anyway? I play damned good ten- 
nis when I get time to practice.” 

“Athletes are lousy lovers,” she 
said. “Your correspondence is on 
your desk.” She nodded toward it. 
“Get it signed, will you? I’ve got a 
dinner date.” 

Lindsay restrained an impulse to 
ask her with what and signed the 
letters dutifully. 

Nina was a spy, of course, or she 
wouldn’t have the job. In view of 
his own assignment and the deli- 
cacy of Terro-Martian relations at 
the moment, she must be a good 
one. 

He handed her the letters, noted 
the slight sway of her thick body 
as she walked toward the dispatch- 
chute. A pity, he thought, that the 
rest of her failed to match the long 
perfect legs she had so unex- 
pectedly put on display. 

“Oh, Miss Beckwith,” he called 
after her. “You don’t have to list 
my appointments on the tele- 
prompter when I’m making a 
speech after this.”

SAM MERWIN, JR. 



She stopped, cast him an oblique 
glance over one shoulder and said 
without much interest, “I didn’t 
know whether you’d get back here 
or not — and it wouldn’t do to for- 
get the Secretary General.” 

“All right,” he said in resignation. 
When she had gone he wondered 
if he should have told her what 
du Fresne had said about his pos- 
sible assassination, decided it was 
just as well he had kept mum. He 
wenl, up on the roof for a copter. 

HE DINNER was informal. 
Lindsay and Fernando Ander- 
son, the flamboyant junior senator 
from New Mexico, were the only 
guests. They were four at the 
charming ante bellum mahogany 
table of the Secretary General’s 
Natchez mansion. Carlo Bergozza, 
the Secretary General himself — 
courteous, with natural as well as 
harness-stooped shoulders, a trifle 
vague — and his daughter and offi- 
cial hostess, Maria — vividly bru- 
nette and dynamic despite the 
twist given her body by her harness 
and the mask of huge triangular 
spectacles — made up the rest of the 
party. 

The meal was simple, automati- 
cally served, well prepared. It con- 
sisted of plankton soup with chives 
in chilled bowls, noisettes of lamb 
with yeast-truffles and bamboo- 
grass and, in deference to Lindsay, 
a dessert of Martian lichenberries. 
Conversation consisted of routine 
gambits and responses until the 
dessert. 

Then Senator Anderson removed 
his diamond-shaped raspberry 
glasses and said, “You’ll pardon 



me, but I want to see what our dis- 
tinguished visitor really looks like. 
After all, he can see us as we are.” 
Secretary General Bergozza 
looked briefly shocked. Then his 
overpowering courtesy came to his 
rescue and he laid aside his own 
dark green spectacles. He said, 
“You know, Lindsay, you remind 
me a little of an American am- 
bassador to the Court of Saint 
James a hundred and fifty years 
ago — I believe his name was Har- 
vey. He refused to wear knee- 
britches to his own reception. 
Other times, other customs.” 

“I’m sorry if my appearance is 
bothering people,” said Lindsay, 
noting that Maria, without her 
glasses, came close to being a truly 
pretty young woman. “I’m not try- 
ing to disturb them — I merely want 
them to see me as a true represen- 
tative of my own world.” 

Maria said impulsively, “It isn’t 
that you bother us — not really. It’s 
just that you’re a little too good 
looking. Almost like a gladiator. 
People aren’t used to it in a states- 
man.” 

“Too good looking— with this 
busted beak of mine?” Lindsay 
pressed a finger against his nose, 
which had been broken in youth 
by a wild pitch. 

Senator Anderson said, “The 
slight irregularity of your nose is 
just enough to keep you from be- 
ing too pretty, Lindsay.” He smiled 
and added, “You certainly stirred 
up a cyclotron with your speech 
this afternoon. The British are 
planning a white paper.” 

“I merely stated facts as I know 
them,” said Lindsay. 

“They aren’t used to facts — not

unless they have been computer- 
processed,” said the senator. He 
seemed pleased for some reason, 
added, “You may have broken 
some real ice, Lindsay. I’ve been 
trying for years to work out a way 
to tell people computers are rob- 
bing them of all powers of deci- 
sion.” 

“All they have to do is confine 
them to mathematical problems 
and let people decide human ones,” 
said Lindsay. 

The Secretary General cleared 
his throat. He said, “Without the 
computers there would be no 
United Worlds. There would be no 
world at all, probably.” 

It was a rebuke. Carlo Bergozza 
redonned his spectacles and rose 
from the table. He said, “If you’ll 
excuse me I have some business to 
attend to. I’m sure my daughter 
will see that you are properly en- 
tertained.” He left the room with 
slow, old-man steps. 

Maria said fondly, “Poor darling, 
he gets so upset. He’ll take a pill 
and go to sleep. Let’s go to the 
bathroom, shall we?” 

T HOUGH outwardly the Secre- 
tary General’s mansion was hy- 
per-gingerbread steamboat Gothic, 
inwardly it was entirely modern in 
plan. There was a living room, of 
course, for formal receptions, but 
as in all normal Earth-dwellings of 
the period the bathroom was the 
lived-in chamber. 

There and there only did people 
of the 2070’s permit themselves to 
relax. This was a logical develop- 
ment of latter-day plumbing and 
air conditioning and the crowding 



of apartment and small-house life. 
Actual lavatory plumbing was con- 
cealed, in this instance, by an 
etched glass screen. Otherwise the 
room featured comfortable plastic 
lounge chairs and sofas around a 
fifteen-foot sunken tub and a small 
semicircular bar, fully equipped. 

On entering Maria unfastened 
her harness and coverall and stood 
before them, a sweet-bodied dark- 
eyed girl in her early twenties, clad 
in shorts and halter. “Lord!” she 
exclaimed, pushing dark hair back 
from her broad low forehead, “It 
feels good to relax. Zalen, I want 
to talk to you.” 

“Delighted,” said Lindsay, mild- 
ly surprised at the use of his Mar- 
tian first name. 

“I’ve got something to tell him 
first,” said Anderson, unhitching 
his own harness and emerging as a 
lean medium-sized man in good 
condition for his forty years. “I got 
word just before I flew up here to- 
night that your life may be in dan- 
ger, Zalen.” 



L INDSAY accepted the arrack- 
fizz Maria handed him, said 
“That makes warning number two, 
Senator. Du Fresne talked to me 
about it this afternoon.” 

Maria paled visibly. She said, 
“It sounds impossible!” 

“It backs up the judgment of my 
own group,” said Senator Ander- 
son. “Du Fresne is just about the 
smartest computerman we have.” 
He eyed Lindsay speculatively, 
added, “You don’t seem much im- 
pressed by your danger, Zalen.” 
“How can I be?” Lindsay coun- 




12 



SAM MERWIN, JR. 



tered. “After all, Earth is supposed 
to be much further advanced than 
Mars in civilization. And we have 
had no political murder on Mars in 
more than fifty years.” 

Maria made a despairing gesture. 
“Oh, dear!” she exclaimed. “You 
don’t understand, Zalen. On Mars 
you have both room and time to 
settle your political conflicts. And 
you don’t have computers.” 

“We have some pretty sharp 
rows,” Lindsay told her. “But we 
don’t have anyone assassinated.” 
He paused, looked at them both, 
added, “Do you have many of them 
here?” 

“Not many,” said Anderson. 
“But there is a growing tendency 
to go along with computer verdicts, 
no matter how extreme.” 

“And you believe the British 
computers are giving accurate an- 
swers when they recommend the 
dumping of millions of pairs of 
utterly useless hunting boots on 
Mars? Or those rubber shower cur- 
tains they unloaded on us two years 
ago?” 

The Senator said, “There is, un- 
fortunately, no question as to the 
accuracy of computer answers. The 
trouble seems to lie in some special 
condition, local to Britain, that 
effects computers.” 

“But if the British computers are 
wrong, why doesn’t somebody do 
something about it?” Lindsay 
asked. 

Anderson said, “If it were that 
simple, Zalen . His smile was 
rueful. “Unfortunately our English 
friends — or their rulers at any rate 
—are determined that socialism is 
the only government suitable to 
their country. Actually it is noth- 



ing of the sort — they can thrive 
only with a mercantile capitalism 
under a nominal constitutional 
monarchy.” 

“In that case I still don’t see — ” 
Lindsay began. 

“Contrary to what you’re think- 
ing, their leaders are not villains,” 
Anderson told him. “They are men 
and women obsessed with an ideal 
that has hampered them for almost 
two centuries. And they are incap- 
able of accepting any conclusion 
counter to their ideals.” 

“Even to impoverishing an entire 
planet?” Lindsay asked. 

Anderson shrugged. “A penalty 
of their insularity,” he replied. 
“The reason for this little meeting, 
Zalen, is to explain that not all of 
us are in favor of supporting Brit- 
ain and its absurd production bun- 
gling at the expense of Mars. A 
few of us are becoming singularly 
fed up with the computer neurosis 
that seems to have this planet in 
its grip.” 

Maria leaned forward, her dark 
eyes brilliant in their intensity. She 
said, “Can’t you see, Zalen, that is 
why we are so concerned with your 
possible assassination? We fear the 
whole of Earth is on the lip of a 
nervous breakdown. Unless the grip 
of the computers is broken any- 
thing might happen. And we’re 
counting on you, with your fresh 
viewpoint and prestige, to help us.” 

“I was hoping you might be con- 
cerned about me” said Lindsay 
softly. “After all, I’m the one who 
is supposed to be killed.” He 
watched a sudden flush of embar- 
rassment add charming brilliance 
to the vividness of the Secretary 
General’s daughter.

“Of course we’re concerned,” 
she said defensively. “We’re not 
really monsters, Zalen.” 

“What Maria means,” said An- 
derson swiftly, “is that if the worst 
should happen it will go a long way 
toward making Earth entirely com- 
puter-dependent, if du Fresne’s 
prophecy is fulfilled a lot of people 
who might go on fighting will sim- 
ply give up.” 

“Just what is your stake in this, 
Senator?” Lindsay asked. 

NDERSON said, “I could give 
give you a score of ‘good’ rea- 
sons, Zalen. But my real reason is 
this — I’m damned if I want to see 
professional politicians become rub- 
ber-stamps to a computer. When 
Sylac was first used officially three 
decades ago, it looked as if it might 
be a help. All we had to do was 
palm off all unpopular decisions on 
the machine. 

“Elsac, however, has proved to 
be something else,” he went on. “It 
is making too damned many of our 
decisions for us — and thanks to our 
having set Sylac up as a master- 
brain god we can’t controvert its 
judgment. When President Giovan- 
nini gets his new Giac computer 
working we might as well shut up 
shop. And the announcement that 
Giac is in operation may come at 
any time now.” 

Lindsay studied him, then said, 
“Your real complaint then, Fer- 
nando, is that the computers de- 
prive you of patronage and power.” 

“That’s about it,” said the sena- 
tor from New Mexico. We’ll be re- 
duced to the level of the political 
commissars of the Soviet nations. 



The scientists and symbolic logi- 
cians who feed and tend the com- 
puters will actually be running the 
country. And the world.” 

“And just where do I come into 
this?” Lindsay asked. 

“You, Zalen, are the last repre- 
sentative of the last sizeable and 
important human organism that is 
not dependent upon computer 
judgment,” said Anderson. “That’s 
our side of it. From your own side 
— if you already distrust computer 
decisions, as in the case of the Brit- 
ish hunting boots — you surely don’t 
want to see them in full control.” 
“Hardly,” said Lindsay. “But at 
the same time I have no desire to 
be assassinated or to be the cause 
of an Earth-Mars war.” 

“Think it over, Zalen,” said An- 
derson. “I need hardly tell you 
that I am not speaking for myself 
alone.” He got up, put down his 
glass, bade Maria farewell and left 
the Martian alone with her. 

When he had gone Lindsay 
looked at the girl, who returned his 
gaze quite openly for a long mo- 
ment before her eyes fell away. He 
said, “Somehow the senator and 
you seem an odd combination.” 
She made no pretense of misun- 
derstanding but said candidly, 
“Perhaps I am neurotic in my dis- 
trust of computers but I cannot 
help that. Those of us who have 
any true sensitivity unblunted by 
the psycho-mechanistics of the era 
all share this distrust. It is natural, 
since we are few and weak, that we 
should seek what allies we can find 
among the strong.” 

“I’ve always heard that politics 
makes strange bedfellows,” said 
Lindsay casually.

SAM MERWIN, JR. 



It was obvious that he had com- 
mitted a faux pas. Maria’s blush 
returned and her expression froze. 
Lindsay cursed himself for a fool. 
With the development of all sorts 
of pneumatic resting devices the 
word bed had become not only ob- 
solete but definitely distasteful in 
well-bred Tellurian circles. Its use 
was as decried as was that of the 
word bloody in Victorian England. 

She said angrily, “I assure you, 
Mr. Lindsay, that Senator Ander- 
son and I have never. .” Voice and 
anger faded alike as she apparently 
realized that Lindsay had not in- 
tended insult. 

He let her mix a second drink for 
both of them. Then, standing close 
to her and noting the smooth per- 
fection of her creamy white skin, 
“I wonder if your father knows that 
he is nourishing a subversive in his 
family.” 

She said with a trace of impa- 
tience, “Oh, poor papa never sees 
the trees for the forest.” 

“You’re a damned unhappy girl, 
aren’t you?” he asked her. He 
didn’t need an answer, but real- 
ized she wanted to talk about it. 

She said, her eyes shining suspi- 
ciously, “You’re right, of course, 
I’m very unhappy — constricted in 
behavior by my father’s position, 
unable to say aloud what I really 
think, how I really feel. Somtimes 
I think I must be living in some 
Gothic poet’s dream of loneliness.” 
“Contrary to the beliefs of most 
psychiatrists,” said Lindsay, half- 
touched, half-appalled by Maria’s 
intensity, “we are all of us alone.” 
“Somehow I knew you’d under- 
stand!” she exclaimed, without tak- 
ing her dark eyes from his. “I’m not 



allowed to date gladiators, of 
course. You’re the only man I’ve 
ever been with who was not afraid 
to look as he is.” 

“You’d better come to Mars,” he 
suggested, shying away a little from 
the high voltage the Secretary Gen- 
eral’s daughter seemed to be gen- 
erating. “I can assure you you’d 
have a chance to reveal the charms 
nature gave you without shame.” 

She laughed with a sudden 
change of spirits. “It’s at least a 
half hour since dinner. Let’s take 
a dip.” She tossed back her lustrous 
dark hair with a shake of her head 
and her hands went to the clasp 
of her halter, a moment later to 
that of her shorts. “Come on,” she 
called, extending her arms to ex- 
pose her exciting young body be- 
fore him. “The water will cool us 
off.” 

It didn’t work out that way, of 
course. Lindsay was barely in the 
tub-pool before Maria’s arms were 
about his neck, her body close 
against his, her lips thrusting up- 
ward toward his own. For a mo- 
ment he felt panic, said, “Hey! 
What if somebody comes? Your fa- 
ther — ” 

“Silly! Nobody will,” she re- 
plied, laughing softly. 

His last rational thought for 
quite awhile was, Oh well — I’m 
hardly in a position to get the Sec- 
retary General’s daughter angry. 

F ALSE DAWN was spreading 
its dim fanlight over the east- 
ern horizon as he coptered back to 
his official quarters in the city. Try- 
ing to restore some order to 
thoughts and emotions thoroughly 




THE AMBASSADOR

disrupted by the unexpected events 
of the evening, he wondered a lit- 
tle just what he had got himself 
into. 

Mars, of course, was scarcely a 
Puritan planet, populated as it was 
by the hardiest and most adventur- 
ous members of the human race, of 
all races. But there had been some- 
thing almost psychopathic about 
Maria’s passion. It had been far too 
intense to have been generated 
solely through regard for him. 

The girl had made love to him 
simply to relieve her own inner ten- 
sions, he thought wryly. Lacking a 
man she could love, walled in by 
the high officialdom of her father’s 
lofty position, she had turned to 
him in the same way she turned to 
the anti-computer movement — as a 
way of feeling less lonely for a 
while. Still, it had been sweet — if 
a little frightening in retrospect. 

And it had been a little decadent 
too. 

With the copter on autopilot he 
lit a cigarette and forced his 
thoughts away from the girl. Pie 
wondered if the Governors of Mars 
were sufficiently in key with the 
current feelings of Earthfolk to un- 
derstand fully how deep the reper- 
cussions from his speech might go. 
He wondered if they had consid- 
ered fully the possibility of inter- 
planetary war. 

True, Mars was undoubtedly 
better equipped to defend itself 
against such attack than was 
Earth. Like the mother planet it 
had its share of robot rockets capa- 
ble of launching a counterattack. 
And thanks to the comparative 
sparseness and decentralization of 
its population it was far less vul- 



nerable to attack. 

But war between the planets 
would be destructive of far more 
than cities and the people that lived 
in them. It would mean inevitably 
a breakdown of the entire fabric of 
civilized humanity— a tenuous fab- 
ric, true, but all that existed to 
maintain man. 

And an isolated Mars, even if 
self-sufficient, would be a sorry sub- 
stitute for a red planet that was 
part of the United Worlds. It 
would mean a setback of genera- 
tions, perhaps centuries. 

He began to feel a new under- 
standing of the importance of his 
mission. With understanding came 
something akin to fear lest he 
should not be able to accomplish it 
without disaster. It was going to 
be his job to inaugurate some sort 
of therapy for Earth’s illness. It 
was, in effect, one man against a 
planet. 

Considering the men and wom- 
en with whom he had talked that 
day he was unable to take the assas- 
sination threat too seriously. Some- 
how these neurotics and warped 
zealots, with their allergies and dis- 
tortion kits, seemed unlikely to un- 
dertake or carry through any such 
drastic action. Their very inhibi- 
tions would forbid it. 

Not that Maria had been exactly 
inhibited. Damn! The girl refused 
to stay out of his thoughts. He re- 
called what she had told him of 
her conspiracy against the comput- 
ers, of its aims and methods. And 
again he smiled wryly to himself. 

They were like spoiled children, 
he thought. A little group of over- 
intense young men and women, 
neurotic, excitable, unstable, meet- 




16 



ing in one another’s houses or in 
expensive cafes, plotting little coups 
that never quite came off. 

From certain unguarded phrases 
Maria had dropped during the less 
frenetic periods of their evening to- 
gether, he gathered that their cur- 
rent aim was actual physical sabo- 
tage of Giac, the mightiest of all 
computers about to be unveiled, 
before it went into work. 

They didn’t even realize, he 
thought, that sabotage would avail 
them nothing in the long run — or 
the short either. Destruction of the 
computers would not cure Earth. 
It might easily increase the reliance 
of Earthfolk upon their cybernetic 
monsters. What was needed to ef- 
fect a cure was destruction of hu- 
man confidence in and reliance 
upon these machines. 

And how in hell, he wondered, 
was he going to manage that? 

T O A MAN from level, water- 
starved Mars the sight of New 
Orleans still ablaze with lights at 
five o’clock in the morning was 
something of a miracle. Mars had 
its share of atomic power-plants, of 
course, but such sources had proved 
almost prohibitively costly as pro- 
viders of cheap power. 

That was true on Earth too, of 
course, but Earth had its rivers, its 
waterfalls, its ocean tides to help 
out. More important, it averaged 
some fifty million miles closer to 
the Sun, thus giving it immense 
storage supplies of solar heat for 
power. Without these resources the 
thousand-square-mile expanse of 
intricately criss-crossed artificial 
lighting that was the United

Worlds capital would have been 
impossible. 

Lindsay wondered how any peo- 
ple possessed of a planet so rich 
could be afflicted with such poverty 
of soul. Or was this very opulence 
the cause? His own planet was 
comparatively poor— yet nervous 
breakdowns were few and far 
between. There the ugly strove for 
beauty, instead of the reverse. 

He parked the copter on the ga- 
rage-plat, pressed the button, and 
watched it sink slowly out of sight 
to its concealed hangar. Like all 
Martian natives to leave for Earth, 
he had been warned about the in- 
tense heat and humidity that as- 
sailed most of the mother planet, 
especially in the UW capital. Yet 
the night breeze felt pleasantly cool 
against his face and its thickness 
was like the brush of invisible vel- 
vet against his skin. Perhaps, he 
thought, he was more of an Earth- 
ling than three generations of Mar- 
tian heredity made likely. 

He did miss the incredible bril- 
liance of the Martian night skies. 
Here on Earth the stars shone as 
puny things through the heavy at- 
mosphere. 

But, he thought guiltily, he did 
not have as severe a pang of home- 
sickness as he ought. 

In a state of self-bemusement he 
rode the elevator down to his suite 
on the ninety-first story. And was 
utterly unprepared for the assault 
which all but bore him to the floor 
as he stepped out into his own 
foyer. 

Since the attack came from be- 
hind and his assailant’s first move 
was to toss a bag over his head, 
Lindsay had no idea of what the 




THE AMBASSADOR 



17 



would-be assassin looked like. For a 
moment he could only struggle 
blindly to retain his balance, ex- 
pecting every instant to feel the 
quick searing heat of a blaster burn 
through his back. 

But no heat came, nor did the 
chill of a dagger. Instead he felt 
his attacker’s strong hands encircle 
his neck in a judo grip. 

This was something Lindsay un- 
derstood. He thrust both his own 
hands up and backward, getting 
inside the assassin’s grip and break- 
ing it. His thumbnails dug into 
nerve centers and he bent an arm 
sharply. There was a gasp of agony 
and he felt a large body crumple 
under the pressure. 



L INDSAY’S first impulse was 
to summon the constabulary. 
His second, after examining the 
face of his would-be slayer, was to 
drag the man into the shelter of 
his apartment, revive him and 
seek to learn what he could about 
the attempt. 

To his astonishment he discov- 
ered that he knew the man. His 
assigned murderer was long, red- 
headed Pat O’Ryan rated as a top 
gladiator, a tennis and squash 
champion whose reputation was al- 
most as widespread among sporting 
fans on Mars as on Earth. Lindsay 
had remodeled his own backhand, 
just the year before, upon that of 
the man sent to kill him. 

He got some whiskey from the 
serving bar beside the vidar screen, 
poured a little of it between the un- 
conscious killer’s lips. O’Ryan sput- 
tered and sat up slowly, blinking. 



He said, “Get me some gin, will 
you?” 

Lindsay returned the whiskey to 
its place, got the requested liquor, 
offered some neat to the tennis 
player in a glass. O’Ryan downed 
it, shuddered, looked at Lindsay 
curiously. He said, “What went 
wrong? You’re supposed to be 
dead.” 

Lindsay shrugged and said, “I 
know some judo too. You weren’t 
quite fast enough, Pat.” 

O’Ryan moaned again, reached 
for the bottle. Then he said, “I 
remember now. Thank God you got 
my right arm — I’m left-handed.” 

“I know,” Lindsay told him 
laconically. 

The would-be assassin looked 
frightened. He said, “How do you 
know?” 



“I play a little tennis myself,” 
Lindsay told him. “How come they 
sent a man like you on such a mis- 
sion?” 

“Top gladiator — top assign- 

ment,” said the athlete. “We’re sup- 
posed to do something besides play 
games for our keep.” 

“That’s a wrinkle in the social 
setup I didn’t know about,” said 
Lindsay. “Mind telling me who sent 
you?” 

“Not at all. It was my sponsors, 
the New Hibernian A.C.” He 
frowned. “According to the com- 
puters I was in. There’s going to be 
hell to pay over my muffing it.” 

“How do you feel about that?” 
the Martian asked him. 

O’Ryan shrugged. “It’s okay by 
me,” he said. “They can hardly de- 
grade me for fouling up this kind of 
a job. I’ll simply tell them their in- 
formation was incomplete. No one

SAM MERWIN, JR. 



knew you knew judo.” He eyed the 
gin, added, “A good thing you 
didn’t feed me whiskey. I’m allergic 
to all grain products — even in al- 
cohol. Gomes from being fed too 
much McCann’s Irish oatmeal 
when I was a kid.” 

“Interesting,” said Lindsay, won- 
dering how the conversation had 
taken this turn. “What does 
whiskey do to you?” 

The gladiator shuddered. “It 
usually hits me about twenty-four 
hours afterward. Makes my eyes 
water so I can’t see much. I’ve got a 
match at the Colosseum tomorrow 
night. I hope you’ll be there.” 

“So do I,” said Lindsay dryly. 
“You wouldn’t know who gave you 
this little chore on me, would you?” 
“Not likely,” said the gladiator. 
“When we report at the club every 
evening we find our assignments 
stuck in our boxes. Usually we get 
orders to meet a dame. This was 
something different.” 

“I see what you mean,” Lindsay 
told him. 

O’Ryan got up, said, “Well, I 
might as well be running along. I’ll 
give them hell for fouling up the 
computer-prophecy. Look me up 
after the match tomorrow. And 
thanks for not having me pinched. 
I might have had to spend the night 
in a cell. That’s bad for condition- 
ing.” 

“You’re quite welcome,” said 
Lindsay, feeling like a character in 
a semi-nightmare. “Will I be seeing 
you again — this way?” 

“Unlikely,” the gladiator told 
him. “They’ll have to run a lot of 
checks on you after this before they 
try again. See you tomorrow.” 
Lindsay looked after his visitor 



with amazement. Then it occurred 
to him that computers were sub- 
stituting not only for human judg- 
ment but for human conscience as 
well. And this, he felt certain, was 
important. 

Turning in on his contour couch, 
Lindsay recalled that he had given 
whiskey to the allergic athlete. He 
decided then and there that he 
would be in attendance at the 
match in the Colosseum that eve- 
ning. 

H E GOT to his office about 
eleven o’clock. His desk was 
stacked high with messages, written 
and taped, and all sorts of folk 
wished to talk with him on the 
vidarphone. Nina, looking more 
slovenly than ever, had arranged 
them neatly, according to their na- 
ture and importance in separate lit- 
tle piles. 

“Next time you tear up the pea- 
patch,” she informed him resent- 
fully, “I’m going to get in some 
help.” She eyed him with somber 
speculation, added, “I hear the Sec- 
Gen turned in early last night.” 
“You’ve got big ears,” said Lind- 
say. 

“I get around,” she said. “I’m 
supposed to keep tabs on you, boss.” 
“Then you must know someone 
tried to kill me early this morning 
when I came back from Natchez.” 
Nina’s eyes narrowed alarmingly 
under the glasses that covered them. 
She said, “Why didn’t you report 
it?” She sounded like a com- 
mander-in-chief questioning a jun- 
ior aide for faulty judgment. 

“I won,” Lindsay said simply. 
“There was no danger.” 




THE AMBASSADOR 



19 



“Who was it?” she asked. And, 
when he hesitated, “I’m not going 
to shout it from the housetops, 
boss.” 

“It was Pat O’Ryan.” 

“You handled Pat?” she asked, 
apparently astonished. Something 
in her tone told him Nina knew his 
would-be assassin. 

“Why not?” he countered. “It 
wasn’t much of a brawl.” 

“But Pat . she began, and 
hesitated. Then, all business again, 
“We’d better get at some of this. 
You have a date to be psyched by 
Dr. Craven at two o’clock.” 

“What for?” he asked, startled. 
“Routine,” she told him. “Every- 
one connected with UW has to go 
through it. But cheer up, boss, it 
doesn’t hurt — much.” 

“Okay,” he said resignedly. 
“Let’s get to work.” 

While he dictated Lindsay found 
himself wondering just who was 
paying Nina’s real salary. If she 
were a spy for the same group that 
had sent O’Ryan to kill him, his 
position was delicate, to put it mild- 
ly. But for some reason he doubted 
it. There were too many groups 
working at once to make any such 
simple solution probable. 

When she departed briefly to 
superintend a minor matter out of 
the office, he found himself staring 
at the wastebasket by his tilt-chair. 
A heart-shaped jewel-box of trans- 
parent crystoplastic lay within it. 
Curious, Lindsay plucked it out. It 
had evidently held some sort of 
necklace and bore the mark of 
Zoffany’s, the Capital’s costliest 
jeweler. Within it was a note that 
read : For Nina, who lost last night 
— as ever . The signature was an 



indecipherable scrawl. 

Lindsay stuck the card in his wal- 
let, returned the box to the waste- 
basket. Who in hell, he wondered, 
would be sending this sort of gift 
to his slatternly thick-bodied secre- 
tary. The answer seemed obvious. 
The sender was her real boss, pay- 
ing her off in a personal way that 
would obviate suspicion. Lindsay 
wondered exactly what Nina had 
lost. 

He was not surprised when she 
said she would come along to the 
psychiatrist’s with him after an of- 
fice lunch of veal pralines, soya 
buns and coffee. He suggested she 
might be tired, might want the day 
off. 

She said, “Night soil, boss! Be- 
tween the Sec-Gen’s daughter and 
things like Pat O’Ryan I’m going 
to keep an eye on you.” 

As if on signal the vidar-screen 
lit up and Maria’s face appeared on 
it. She had not donned harmopan 
or glasses and looked quite as lovely 
as she had the night before. She 
said, “Zalen, I’ve got to see you to- 
night. Something has come up.” 
Lindsay nodded. He figured out 
his schedule, suggested, “I’m going 
to the match in the Colosseum. 
Why not take it in with me?” 

She shook her head, told him, 
“I’m tangled up at a banquet for 
the Egypto-Ethiopian delegation. I 
can meet you afterward though. 
How about the Pelican?” 

“That’s not very private,” he 
protested. 

“All the more reason,” she an- 
nounced. “This is important!” 
“And seeing me in private isn’t?” 
Despite himself a trace of wounded 
male entered his tone.

SAM MERWIN, JR. 



Maria laughed softly, her dark 
eyes dancing. “Perhaps later,” she 
said softly. “You’ll understand 
when I talk to you.” She clicked 
off and the screen was empty. 

“Damned cat!” said Nina 
through a haze of cigarette-smoke. 
“Watch out for her, boss — she’s a 
cannibal.” 

“And I’m a bit tough and 
stringy,” he told her. 

Nina said, “Night soil!” again 
under her breath and led the way 
out of the office. Lindsay wondered 
if she were jealous. 

D R. CRAVEN received them in 
a comfortable chamber, the 
north wall of which was all glass 
brick, the south wall a solid bank of 
screens and dials. He was a soft- 
faced man who wore lozenge- 
shaped light blue spectacles and 
seemed afflicted with a slight chin 
rash. He caught Lindsay’s regard, 
rubbed his chin in mild embarrass- 
ment, said, “I’ve a mild allergy to 
paranoids.” 

Lindsay looked at Nina distrust- 
fully but she nodded and said, “Go 
ahead — he won’t break your arm. 
I’ll wait outside.” 

The psychiatrist closed his office 
door. After settling him in a com- 
fortable contour couch, Dr. Craven 
opened up with, “I don’t want you 
to have any worries about this test, 
Ambassador. If anybody’s crazy 
here it’s me. According to very 
sound current theory all psychia- 
trists are insane. If we weren’t we 
wouldn’t be so concerned with 
sanity in others.” 

Lindsay asked, “Why in hell am 
I being tested anyway?” 



Craven replied, “President Gio- 
vannini himself came in for a 
voluntary checkup just last week.” 
As if that were an answer. 

Lindsay suppressed a desire to 
ask if the North American presi- 
dent had all his marbles. He had an 
idea any levity he displayed would 
register against him. Dr. Craven 
asked him a number of apparently 
routine questions which Lindsay 
answered via a recorder. How old 
he was, whether he liked flowers, 
how often he had fought with his 
schoolmates as a boy, what sort of 
food he preferred. 

“Good,” the doctor said, pushing 
aside the microphone on his desk 
and motioning Lindsay to do like- 
wise. He rose, wheeled a device like 
an old-fashioned beautician’s hair- 
drier close to the couch, adjusted 
the helmet to Lindsay’s head. 
“Now,” he added, “I want you to 
think as clearly as you can of your 
mother. Keep your eyes on the 
screen and give me as clear a pic- 
ture as you can.” 

He pressed a button and the whir 
or a camera, also focussed on the 
screen, sounded from the wall be- 
hind Lindsay. When Dr. Craven 
nodded, he concentrated and, to his 
amazement, watched a fuzzy like- 
ness of his maternal parent take 
form on the screen. 

This was something new, he de- 
cided, and said so. Dr. Craven re- 
plied, “Yes — the psychopic is brand 
new. But concentrate on the pic- 
ture, please. You’re losing it.” 

It had faded to almost nothing. 
Lindsay concentrated again, this 
time brought his maternal parent 
into clear focus. He felt a little like 
a man who has never wielded a 




THE AMBASSADOR 



21 



brush in his life and has suddenly 
discovered he could paint a perfect 
portrait. 

Dr. Craven said nothing for a 
moment. Then, “Will you try to 
visualize your mother without the 
blemish at her temple?” 

Lindsay tried, and all but lost the 
picture entirely. He brought it back 
again, blemish and all, felt a sudden 
tug of nostalgia for the firm kindly 
features of the woman who had 
brought him into the world. A min- 
ute or so later Dr. Craven pressed 
another button and the screen went 
blank. “That will do very nicely,” 
he said. “You may wait for the 
psycho-computer verdict outside if 
you wish.” 

He found Nina sprawled in an 
anteroom chair with her long legs 
stuck out before her, contemplating 
a flashing diamond-and-emerald 
necklace. He said, before she looked 
up and saw him, “Business good, 
Miss Beckwith?” 

To his amazement Nina began to 
snivel. And when he asked her what 
he had done to cause it she snapped 
angrily, “You big pig, you haven’t 
the sensitivity to understand. Don’t 
ever speak of it as business again. 
Now I’ll have to bathe my eyes 
when I get home or they will be all 
swollen and horrible.” 

She removed her glasses and they 
were swollen. Lindsay had seen too 
much of allergic reactions since 
reaching Earth not to know he was 
looking at another. He was relieved 
when she put her glasses back on. 

“Sorry,” he said. “I didn’t mean 
to disturb you.” 

“I know it,” she replied, “but you 
did.” 

“Perhaps, if you told me — ” he 



began. Dr. Craven chose that mo- 
ment to emerge from his office. 

“If you’ll come back inside,” he 
said. “There are just a few more 
questions I’d like to ask, Ambassa- 
dor.” 

“Ask them here,” said Lindsay. 
He had no desire to go back under 
the drier. 

Dr. Craven hesitated and rubbed 
his chin, which was bright red 
again. He said finally, “Mr. Lind- 
say, you didn’t kill your mother be- 
fore you were seventeen, did you?” 
“My mother died last year,” said 
Lindsay, unbelieving. 

“Incredible!” muttered the psy- 
chiatrist, shaking his head. “Ac- 
cording to the computer you must 
have . .” He paused again, then 
said, “I hope this won’t embarrass 
you but you evidently are a man 
who prefers men to women. The 
stigmata is definite and shows — ” 
“Night soil!” Nina exploded her 
favorite expression before Lindsay 
could collect his wits for an answer. 
“I’m sorry to disappoint you, Dr. 
Craven, but this man’s a veritable 
satyr. I caught him looking at my 
legs yesterday. Ask Maria Bergozza 
if you want any further proof.” 
“But this is impossible!” the psy- 
chiatrist exploded. “According to 
the computer — ” 

“Your computer’s out of whack,” 
Nina said calmly, and led a stunned 
Lindsay out of the place. She 
added, “You didn’t deserve that, 
boss. Not after puffing my eyes up.” 
“Why not just keep your glasss 
on then?” he countered. They re- 
turned to their office in unfriendly 
silence. Lindsay sent Nina home 
early and took a copter across the 
Lake to his own place, there to nap

until time for the match at the 
Colosseum. 



H E FELT more at home in the 
UW box at the vast arena than 
at any time since reaching Earth. 
Since it was a sporting event, the 
eye-glasses were serried, at least in 
the lower, higher-priced tiers, by 
good looking faces, male and fe- 
male, unadorned. 

Someone slid into the comfor- 
table contour chair beside him and 
said, “Evening, Zalen. Enjoying 
yourself?” 

Lindsay looked into Senator Fer- 
nando Anderson’s diamond-shaped 
raspberry glasses. He said, “So far 
— how about you?” 

Anderson made a face. “I had a 
date with a gorgeous item but she 
put me off until later. So I thought 
I’d look in. Maria arranged a seat 
in the UW box. Otherwise I’d be 
watching it on vidar.” 

Lindsay looked up and around 
and discovered that the vast sta- 
dium was packed to the rafters, 
judging by the glowing cigarette 
tips that resembled an uncountable 
horde of frozen fireflies. 

The court itself was pitch-dark, 
save for the lines and the net. He 
had trouble recognizing O’Ryan as 
his would-be assassin and opponent 
walked out. Neither player was 
clearly visible of feature, though 
shoes, shorts and racquets were 
luminous, as were the balls they be- 
gan to hit back and forth across the 
net. 

The only other luminous objects, 
save for the dim exit lights, were 
the betting boards. Lindsay, who 
had never seen one save on a vidar- 



screen before, asked Anderson how 
they worked. The senator from 
New Mexico was glad to explain. 

“Naturally,” he said, “since the 
results of all athletic contests are 
predicted on the computers, there 
is no betting on who will win.” 

“No upsets?” Lindsay asked.” 
Anderson laughed, said, “The 
last time there was an upset — in the 
British Australian test cricket 
matches three years ago — a com- 
puter investigation proved bribery 
and there was a hell of a stink.” 
“Then how do you manage to 
bet?” Lindsay asked. 

“Simple,” said the Senator. “Na- 
turally, in case of accidental injury, 
all bets are void. But otherwise the 
betting is on the percentage of vari- 
ation between the computer predic- 
tion and the actual play of the 
contest. There — you can see the 
computer line on the big board over 
there. The line of actual play will 
be red when it comes on. That way 
there is plenty of chance for betting 
on points, games, sets or match.” 
The man from Mars studied the 
predictor line for the match. It re- 
vealed that Pat O’Ryan, after a fast 
start, was due to slump in the sec- 
ond set, recover in the third and 
polish off his opponent, Yamato- 
Rau from Indonesia, in the fourth 
set with the loss of but one game. 

“Looks like a shoo-in for 
O’Ryan,” he said. “Right?” 

“It ought to be,” the Senator re- 
plied. “He’s taken Yamato-Rau in 
six of their seven previous matches. 
“The second time they played he 
had a sprained wrist that affected 
his volleying.” 

“Care to make a bet?” Lindsay 
asked his companion. 




THE AMBASSADOR 



23 



“Sure — why not?” Anderson 
countered, “Percentage of variation 
for game, set or match?” 

“I'd like to bet on the Indonesian 
to win,” said Lindsay quietly. 

IV 

ENATOR ANDERSON looked 
at Lindsay sharply. He said, 
“You know something.” 

“Against the computer-proph- 
ecy?” Lindsay countered. 

Anderson backed down and gave 
him a hundred to one on a fifty- 
credit bet. “You can’t win, of 
course,” he murmured, “but if you 
do it will be worth it.” 

The match began and the hum 
of the great crowd’s conversation 
slowly quieted. At first it went ac- 
cording to the computer prophecy. 
Serving brilliantly, hitting crisply 
from either hand and smashing and 
volleying with deadly accuracy 
from all parts of the court, Pat 
O’Ryan held complete command of 
the match. 

There was something hypnotic 
about the play — the clean ping of 
racquet strings on luminous ball, 
the swift flight of the ball, a streak 
of light in the darkness, the flash of 
another racquet, the long and intri- 
cate tactics of each exchange, brok- 
en only occasionally by the flash of 
a light that betokened an error or 
an ace and the resulting alteration 
of the scoreboard. 

The red line crept in zigzag 
fashion along the computer board 
as the match progressed, veering 
above or below the white line of the 
prophecy but always returning to 
cross or even to cover it briefly. Big 
O’Ryan tqok the first set six games 



to three on a single service break 
against the Indonesian champion. 

“Money in the bank,” said An- 
derson in Lindsay’s ear as the play- 
ers changed courts following the 
first game of the second set, which 
Yamato-Rau had taken at fifteen. 
“Candy from a baby.”- 

“It’s barely begun,” said Lindsay 
with a confidence he was far from 
feeling. He glanced at the clock 
above the scoreboard, saw that it 
was scarcely ten o’clock. Sickly he 
recalled that O’Ryan had told him 
it took twenty-four hours for his 
grain allergy to take effect. Lindsay 
had given him the drink barely 
seventeen hours before. He began 
to wish he had not bet so thought- 
lessly. 

The second set went to deuce 
twice before Yamato-Rau broke 
O’Ryan’s service to run it out at 
eight-six. This was two games more 
than the computer had calculated 
and caused considerable uproar in 
the crowd. 

“I hear you had some trouble last 
night,” Anderson told him. 

“Nothing serious,” said Lindsay, 
wondering how much the senator 
knew. Dammit, he thought, he 
wished he didn’t like the power- 
hungry politician. 

He wondered if Anderson were 
behind the attempt of the morning 
— and if he were behind it, why? 
There could, he decided, be all 
sorts of Machiavellian motives hid- 
den beneath that smiling face. 
Then the match got under way 
once more, and Lindsay concen- 
trated on the play. 

Once again O’Ryan seemed to be 
in command — just as the computer 
had foretold. Games went to five- 




24 



SAM MERWIN, JR. 



two in his favor. Then, as the play- 
ers changed courts once more, the 
tall Irishman paused to towel off — 
and paid special attention to rub- 
bing his eyes. 

At that his string ran out. Four 
straight times his swiftest drives hit 
the top of the net and bounced back 
into his own court. He blew his 
service thanks to a pair of double- 
faults and three minutes later 
Yamato-Rau had taken the set 
while the crowd sat in stunned si- 
lence. 

The fourth set was pitiful. 
O’Ryan played like a blind man 
and the Indonesian ran it out with 
the loss of exactly one point per 
game. The red line on the com- 
puter-board yawed wildly toward 
the bottom instead of following the 
white line as it should have. 

“Keep your credits,” Lindsay 
told Senator Anderson. “You were 
right. As it turned out I did know 
something after all.” 

“It’s impossible!” cried the sena- 
tor. “But it’s cheap at the price — 
here!” He withdrew his wallet and 
began pulling out crisp hundred- 
credit notes. 

“Look out!” cried Lindsay. 
Around them the stands had 
erupted into violence. While the 
players were shaking hands at the 
net, angry — and, Lindsay suspected, 
frightened — bettors and spectators 
leaped the low barriers and 
swarmed out onto the dark court. 
They hemmed the players in, driv- 
ing them toward the wall directly 
under the UW box in which Lind- 
say and Anderson were sitting. 

Someone threw something and 
Yamato-Rau stumbled and fell to 
his hands and knees. Swinging his 



racquet like one of his ancestors’ 
shillalehs, O’Ryan charged- to his 
rescue, pulled him to his feet, cov- 
ered his retreat to the wall. There 
Lindsay was able to pull first the 
Indonesian, then the Irishman, up 
into the box. 

“Damned fool!” said Anderson. 
“Getting us into a riot.” But a mo- 
ment later Lindsay saw the senator 
swinging hard at an angry customer 
with a fist in which his wallet was 
still clenched. The man made a 
grab for it as someone else hit An- 
derson over the head with a plastic 
bottle. He dropped across a con- 
tour-chair, letting his wallet fall 
from unconscious fingers. 

UW police formed a protective 
wall around them and Pat O’Ryan, 
recognizing Lindsay, said, “Thanks, 
Ambassador. I guess I owe you a 
couple. If my eyes hadn’t gone bad 
on me . .” 

Lindsay was tempted to admit 
his guilt in that matter but decided 
against it. He had no desire to be 
caught in another riot. He picked 
up Anderson’s wallet, put it back in 
the still unconscious senator’s breast 
pocket. A white-clad interne was 
brought through the police cordon, 
knelt beside Anderson and began to 
make repairs. 

“You’d better leave now, Am- 
bassador,” said one of the boss 
policeman respectfully to Lindsay 
when the senator had been carted 
away on a stretcher. Lindsay 
nodded. Then he noticed a slip of 
paper lying beneath the chair across 
which Anderson had fallen. It 
read: rec. 10,000 cdt. 1 em. & di. 
neck. It was from Zoffany, the 
jeweler. 

“What the hell!” Lindsay dis- 




THE AMBASSADOR 



25 



covered he was speaking aloud. He 
stuffed the paper in his pocket and 
followed the officer through a maze 
of underground passages out of the 
Colosseum. He still thought, What 
the hell! What could Nina have re- 
ported about him that was worth 
that sort of money to the senator? 

CPY, SLATTERN or not, Nina 
was efficient, as he realised 
when a bowing motley-clad waiter 
captain smilingly ushered him to a 
secluded table for two in a banquet 
niche of the Pelican. It was Lind- 
say’s first visit to an Earthly after- 
dark cafe and he instinctively com- 
pared it with certain of its imita- 
tions in the comparatively small 
cities of his native planet. 

It was sleeker, better run, far 
more beautiful. Its general color 
scheme was darkly opalescent, sub- 
tly glowing, flattering to its clients. 
And, of course, most of them 
needed flattering, at least to Lind- 
say’s alien eyes. He noted here a 
pair of scimitar-shaped spectacles 
whose turquoise-studded rims 
caught the light like a pair of small 
lemon pies, there a harmopan-cov- 
ered female face that glowed pale 
green in the darkness. 

But even more numerous and 
decorative than at the stadium, the 
gladiators and courtesans were 
present, reinforced by a larding of 
vidar stars visiting or entertaining 
in the capital. And these, Lindsay 
admitted to himself with awed re- 
luctance, outshone in sheer beauty 
and handsomeness any group of 
Martian humans. 

They ought to, he thought. Di- 
rect descendants, figuratively if not 



actually, of the advertising-Holly- 
wood beauty fetish of the previous 
century, they were selected almost 
from birth for their callings and 
trained rigorously from childhood 
on, the males to become athletes or 
actors, the females courtesans or 
actresses. 

There was no race among them, 
for their only standards were beauty 
and physical fitness, no creed but 
achievement in their lines of in- 
dividual entertainment. He caught 
sight of a lissome Euro- African, the 
classic exoticism of her flower-petal 
face illumined by joyous laughter 
beneath a glossy neo-Watusi hairdo, 
as she glided gracefully over the 
dance-floor in the arms of a hunch- 
harnessed and bespectacled part- 
ner. 

The gladiators and courtesans 
alone seemed to find joy in living. 
Lindsay, who had seldom been un- 
happy in his active existence, felt 
his sympathies and heart go out to 
them. He followed the progress of 
a tiny Oriental model whose face 
was alive with good-humor as she 
swept past his table, her exquisite 
figure stressed by a glittering 
jeweled sheathe. 

“You really should wear glasses 
— or else learn not to stare,” said 
Maria, appearing from nowhere 
and sitting down at the table. She 
made amends by extending a warm 
soft hand to grip one of his. Though 
she wore her glasses and her hair 
was severely pulled back, he had no 
difficulty in recalling the fact that, 
unclothed, she was lovely. 

“Why don’t you get in on the 
act?” he suggested, nodding toward 
a pair of models emerging from the 
harmopan room. “All you’d have 




26 

to do would be to remove your specs 
and harness and let your hair 
down.” 

“You’re sweet, Zale,” she said, 
pleased. Then, with a sigh, “But 
there’s a lot more to it than that.” 

“You do all right that way too,” 
he told her boldly. 

She slapped the back of his hand 
and then, growing quickly serious, 
said, “Zale, I didn’t ask you to meet 
me for that. I’ve got so much to ask 
you — so much to tell. Did you really 
find an assassin waiting for you 
when you got home last night? And 
did you kill him?” 

“Yes and no,” said Lindsay. “I 
did find one and I didn’t kill him. 
In fact we parted good friends.” 

“You Martians . .” She sighed, 
then said, “And I understand you 
have already broken two computers 
— this afternoon at the psychiatrist’s 
and this evening at the Colosseum. 
It’s the most marvelous news, dar- 
ling. I’ve got to know how you did 
it.” 

“I’m damned if I know how I 
fouled up Dr. Craven’s computer,” 
he told her. “I’m still trying to fig- 
ure it out.” 

Her face fell. She said, “I was 
hoping you had something . But 
never mind.” Then, brightening, 
“But you’re driving them crazy. 
They ran Dr. Craven’s results 
through Elsac late this afternoon 
and got the same answer. The 
records checked that you didn’t kill 
your mother and 1 know you’re not 
an invert.” She laughed softly. 

Spurred by the erotic atmos- 
phere, plus the dizzying speed of 
recent events and Maria’s nearness, 
he said, “Let’s get out of here and 
go to my place.” 



SAM MERWIN, 1R. 

Her hand covered his again atop 
the table. “I wish we could,” she 
said wistfully. “I like you very 
much, Zale darling. But this is too 
important. We haven’t time. But 
what about the tennis tonight? 
There’s going to be an investiga- 
tion, of course. Won’t you tell me 
how you did it?” 

“Not until I’ve figured out both,” 
he said. “I may be on the track of 
something or it may be sheer 
chance. Until I understand what 
happened at Dr. Craven’s I’m sim- 
ply not sure of my facts.” 

“But there simply isn’t time, 
darling,” Maria told him. “This is 
really what I must talk to you 
about. We got word today that Pre- 
sident Giovannini is going to unveil 
Giac any day now.” 

“Decided against your sabotage 
plan?” he asked her. 

She wrinkled her pert little nose. 
“What’s the use? They’d simply re- 
pair it. Besides, it’s much too well 
guarded. Zale, you’re our only hope 
now.” 

He said “If I’m right, and I’m 
beginning to hope I am, it won’t 
matter whether Giac is unveiled or 
not. In fact, it might be more effec- 
tive if it were.” 

Maria drummed on the table 
with nervous knuckles. “But you 
don’t understand, Zale. You don’t 
think for a minute that the Ministry 
of Computation is taking this lying 
down. I got word less than half an 
hour ago that they are preparing to 
force your recall as an unsuitable 
plenipotentiary.” 

“They can try.” Lindsay spoke 
grimly. This was a move he had 
failed to forsee, though he supposed 
he should have. Inadvertently he 




THE AMBASSADOR 



27 




was becoming a major threat to the 
crockery in the china shop that was 
Earth. 

“They can do it,” Maria said 
simply. “Zale, these people have 
become absolutely dependent upon 
their computers. They aren’t going 
to let their entire creed be wrecked 
by one Martian.” 

“What do you want me to do?” 
he dsked simply. 



“Come with me — now,” she said, 
once more gripping his hand. “A 
group of us want to talk to you, to 
find out how you have done it.” 

He looked at her, found her 
adorable in her earnestness. He 
said, “And if I play guinea pig with 
your friends, then you and I . ?” 
“Of course — as soon as there’s 
time," she told him. 

“You are a little bundle of fana- 



28 



SAM MERWIN, JR, 



ticism, as well as of sex,” he told 
her. “I should think at least, since 
you seem to have such an inside 
track, you could manage to get my 
recall deferred.” 

“That’s just it!” she exclaimed 
bitterly. “I see everything, I hear 
everything — yet I can do nothing. 
Papa thinks I’m merely a foolish 
female creature and his attitude 
blocks me at every turn.” Lindsay 
realized again how fundamentally 
frustrated she was, wondered if she 
would ever find a completely satis- 
factory release. 

Lindsay decided to play along. 
“All right,” he said. “Shall we go?” 

“Thanks, darling,” she promised. 
“We’d better go separately. There 
will be a blue copter-cab waiting 
outside when you leave.” She leaned 
across the table to brush his lips 
briefly with hers, squeezed his hand 
and glided off. 

H E WONDERED, while he 
waited for the check, just how 
foolhardly he was being, allowing 
himself to be summoned to a meet- 
ing of palace conspirators. It could 
very easily be a trap, whether Maria 
knew it or not. It could be a ruse 
to add fuel to the fire being lit 
under him for his recall as a legate 
persona non grata on Earth. 

“You haven’t forgotten our date, 
have you darling?” The voice was 
throatily reproachful above him 
and he looked up in surprise at 
a glittering female figure, who 
seemed to be clad entirely in blaz- 
ing brilliants. 

She was tall and blonde, her hair 
an ocean helmet of gold, sprinkled 
with gems. Her face was beautifully 



boned, with broad cheeks and fore- 
head pierced by a decided widow’s 
peak. Light green eyes slanted up- 
ward beneath brows like the wings 
of some tiny graceful bird. Nose, 
lips and chin gained fascination 
from the perfection they skirted but 
just escaped. Face, arms, upper 
bosom and shoulders wore the even 
tawny golden tan that only some 
blondes can achieve. 

Her figure, ashimmer with gems, 
was lithe of waist, firmly full of 
breast and pelvis, moved with the 
enticing grace of an Indonesian 
temple dancer as she slipped into 
the seat Maria had so recently 
vacated. 

“Sorry, your highness,” he said 
with a look of honest admiration. 
“I didn’t know we had a date.” 

“We have now,” she stated. She 
laid a handbag solidly encrusted 
with diamonds, emeralds and rubies 
on the table, said to the dwarf 
waiter, “Bring me the usual, Joe — 
and give Ambassador Lindsay an- 
other of whatever he’s drinking.” 

At any other time, Lindsay 
thought. He said, “I regret this 
more than you’ll ever know, my 
dear, but I’ve got a copter-cab wait- 
ing for me outside.” 

“It will keep.” The girl pouted 
prettily, then leaned toward him 
and said huskily, “We’ll have just 
one here. Then we can go to my 
place. It’s just outside of Biloxi, 
almost on the Gulf. We can watch 
the dawn come up over the water. 
We can—” 

“Stop twisting my arm,” said 
Lindsay, trying to keep his thoughts 
in focus. Who had sent this girl and 
why? And what, he wondered, 
awaited him in Biloxi. 




THE AMBASSADOR 



29 



He got up, tossed a twenty-credit 
note on the table. “This will pay the 
check,” he informed her. 

“Not so fast,” said the houri, ris- 
ing with him. Trying to ignore her, 
he headed toward the door as fast 
as he could. 

She kept after him and his ears 
burned as he plunged out into the 
night, saw the blue copter-cab wait- 
ing with its door open at the curb. 
But when he tried to plunge toward 
it he was halted by an arm whose 
sharp-faceted jeweled adornments 
cut his adam’s apple. He gasped but 
the girl got in front of him, waving 
her bag. 

There was a faint popping noise 
as the door closed and the copter- 
cab swiftly and silently darted away. 
Stunned by the swiftness of events, 
Lindsay was utterly incapable of 
resistance when his decorative tor- 
mentor thrust him into another 
vehicle. As they took off he said, “I 
suppose this is the prelude to an- 
other assassination try.” 

“Night soil!” said a familiar 
voice. “What the hell do you think 
I just saved you from, boss?” 

L INDSAY uttered one word — a 
word which, he thought later, 
was singularly revealing as to his 
native flair for diplomacy. He said, 
briefly and succinctly, "Huh?” 
“Listen, my fine unfeathered 
Martian friend.” She sounded like 
a primary school teacher addressing 
an overgrown and somewhat back- 
ward pupil. “Somebody fired a glass 
bullet at you from that cab.” 

. “How do you . .?” he began 
helplessly. 

For answer she turned on the 



copter-cab light, revealing the back 
of a uniformed chauffeur, and 
showed him her handbag. There 
was a slight tear in one side of its 
begemmed surface and, when she 
shook it, bits of glass fell to the floor. 
“Careful,” she warned when he 
reached for the bag. “It was prob- 
ably packed with poison.” Then, 
“Can you think of a better shield 
than diamonds?” 

He said, “Ulp!” Unquestionably, 
now that she had revealed herself, 
this glittering creature was his 
slovenly office Nina. Seeking des- 
perately to recover what had at best 
been a shaky boss-secretary rela- 
tionship, he said, “Where are you 
taking me?” 

“Out of the city, boss,” she in- 
formed him. “We really are going 
to my place in Biloxi. You’re much 
too hot a property to be allowed to 
wander around loose. Two tries in 
less than twenty-four hours.” 

“Then Maria . .” he said, won- 
deringly. 

Nina picked his thought up crisp- 
ly. “We don’t know whether your 
little playmate put the finger on 
you consciously or not. But she did 
it. Some of that sweet little crew she 
pals around with are desperate. 
They don’t believe they can lick the 
computers and their only hope is to 
foment incidents that will lead to 
an interplanetary war. Nice kids!” 

“But why pick on me?” he asked. 
“From what Maria said tonight I’m 
their one hope of beating the ma- 
chines.” 

Nina shook her head at him sad- 
ly. “And you’re the best brain our 
Martian cousins could send us. 
Here it is in words of one syllable. 
Maria’s mob wants war. They be-

lieve they can light the powder 
train by arranging the assassination 
of a Martian Plenipotentiary. 

“Meanwhile your speech yes- 
terday and your fouling up Doc 
Craven’s computer this afternoon, 
and whatever you did at the tennis 
tonight, have the Computer crowd 
screaming for your recall before you 
upset their little red wagon.” She 
paused, added, “Naturally Maria’s 
crowd wants to have you killed be- 
fore you become a mere private 
citizen of Mars. Once you’re re- 
moved from office you aren’t im- 
portant enough to cause a war.” 

“Good God!” said Lindsay as the 
double pattern became apparent. 
Then, curiously, “And just whom 
do you represent, Nina?” 

She eyed him steadily, mockingly 
for a moment. Then she said, “Let’s 
just say for now that I represent the 
Model’s Union. We don’t want any 
wartime austerity wrecking our 
pitch. Will that do?” 

“I guess it will have to,” he said. 
Then, plucking a diamond-and- 
emerald necklace from among the 
half-dozen about her throat, “You 
certainly didn’t give poor Anderson 
much for his money.” 

“Stop it!” she snapped. “Do you 
want my eyes to swell up again? In 
a way what happened tonight was 
all your fault. Fernando and I were 
going to keep close tabs on you but 
you fouled me up with your beastly 
remark about my business at Doc 
Craven’s and then put poor Fer- 
nando out of commission by getting 
mixed up in that riot at the Colos- 
seum. I barely made the Pelican in 
time.” 

He thought of giving Nina the 
receipt from Zoffany’s in his pocket. 



decided not to take the chance. So. 
he said, “Is Fernando working for 
the Model’s Union too?” 

“Stop trying to be funny,” she 
told him. “Night soil! You make me 
so damned mad. Letting that little 
tramp Maria nail you.” 

“At the time there wasn’t much 
alternative,” he said. Then, eyeing 
her closely, “How come you’re 
mixed up in UW politics? I thought 
models were strictly for fun and 
games.” 

Nina said matter-of-factly, “I 
won top model rating when I was 
seventeen. I still hold it and I’m 
twenty-six now. A girl can get tired 
of being and doing the same thing 
— even in my profession. Besides, 
I’ve got brains. So I try to use 
them.” 

“How come you decided to be 
my secretary?” 

“We drew lots and I lost,” she 
informed him. 



T HE COPTER dropped by 
searchlight to a flagged terrace 
in front of a dark cottage just off 
the beach. “Thanks, Bob,” said 
Nina. “Tell the boys to stand by 
with their guard beams up.” Then, 
to Lindsay, “Come on, boss, let’s get 
out of this heap.” 

She walked swiftly toward the 
cottage, pressed something. Soft 
lights came on, revealing a charm- 
ing simulated wood dwelling in the 
fine antique Frank Lloyd Wright 
tradition. She ushered him into a 
delightfully gay bathroom looking 
out on the water, said, “Wait here 
while I get this armor off.” 

Lindsay felt a slight qualm as he 
considered what being a top model 




THE AMBASSADOR

at seventeen must mean. And then 
he thought, Why not? Certainly he 
had no claim on Nina’s morals. He 
doubted if anyone had a claim of 
any kind on her. 

She emerged, looking unex- 
pectedly like a young girl in simple 
clout and cup-bra, which exposed 
most of her gorgeously tanned body. 
Her hair, innocent of jewels like the 
rest of her, was clubbed back simply 
with some sort of clip. She lit a ciga- 
rette and said, “Now — how the hell 
are you fouling up the computers?” 
“I’m not,” he told her promptly. 
“At least not in the case of the ten- 
nis match. I just happened to know 
something about Pat O’Ryan the 
people who fed facts to the com- 
puter didn’t.” 

“That goon Pat!” she said. “He’s 
so damned dumb.” 

“You know him well?” he asked 
with a trace of jealousy. 

“I know him.” She dismissed it 
with a flick of her cigarette. “It’s a 
good thing you knew judo too, boss. 
But what did you do to him that 
fouled up the match?” 

“While he was out cold I gave 
him a shot of whiskey to bring him 
’round,” Lindsay told her. “He 
didn’t know about it and I didn’t 
tell him when he informed me 
about his grain-alcohol allergy. So 
for once the computer didn’t get 
full facts. And I had them.” 

For the first time Lindsay basked 
in a smile of approval from Nina. 
She said. “And then you had to 
mess me up at Doc Craven’s so I 
couldn’t sit in on the match.” 

“I’m sorry about that,” he said 
sincerely. “You might brief me so 
I don’t do it again.” 

“Well . .” She hesitated. “I 



don’t want to set myself off. It’s 
not uncommon among us — models. 
You see, we’re proud of our careers,, 
not like the two-credit whores who 
wear glasses and harnesses. And it 
hurts us when someone refers to our 
work as business. You see, there’s 
nothing really commercial about it. 
So when you — ” 

“But how the devil was I to know 
you were a model?” he asked her. 

“I know,” she said illogically. 
“But it still made me mad.” Then, 
frowning, “But if the computer was 
wrong because of incomplete 
knowledge at the Colosseum, what 
was wrong at Doc Craven’s?” 

Lindsay said, “I’m damned if I 
know.” 

“We’ve got to know, with the 
president ready to put Giac to 
work.” 

“I meant to tell you about that,” 
said Lindsay. 

“Don’t worry,” Nina informed 
him. “Your table at the Pelican was 
wired.” 

“Why are you against com- 
puters?” Lindsay asked her. 

She dropped her smoke in a dis- 
posal-tray, said, “Never mind why 
— let’s just accept the fact that I 
am. And not for Fernando Ander- 
son’s reason either. He just wants 
power.” 

“And what do you want?” 

“Me?” Her eyebrows rose in sur- 
prise. “Why, I just want to have 
jun!” She extended her arms and 
flapped her hands like birds. Then, 
again reverting to seriousness, “I 
wish you’d tell me everything that 
went on at Doc Craven’s yesterday. 
Dammit, his office wasn’t wired.” 

Lindsay went through it, as near- 
ly word for word as he could, then 




32 



SAM MERWIN, JR. 



did it again when no answer was 
quickly forthcoming. Nina listened, 
her perfect forehead marred by a 
frown. Finally she said, “Let’s take 
a dip. It’s almost dawn.” 

She removed what clothing she 
wore and Lindsay did likewise. 
They felt the refreshing caress of 
the cool Gulf water on their skins 
—but that was all the caressing 
there was. Nina, unlike Maria, was 
all business despite the near-blatant 
perfection of her charms. Back in 
the bathroom she said, “The only 
thing I can think of is that stigmata 
business. Why should you imagine a 
mark on your mother’s forehead?” 
“Because she had one,” he told 
her bluntly. “It was not unattrac- 
tive — my father used to call it her 
beauty mark.” 

Nina ran long slim fingers 
through her water-dark hair and 
said incredulously, “You mean 
blemishes are not removed auto- 
matically at birth on Mars?” 

“Why, no,” said Lindsay, sur- 
prised. “It’s entirely up to the in- 
dividual — or the parents.” 

“And Doc Craven asked no ques- 
tions that would lead to the truth?” 
the girl asked, blinking. When Lind- 
say shook his head she suddenly 
grabbed him and kissed him and 
did a little dance of sheer joy. “It’s 
simply too good to be true! Two 
computers fouled in one day 
through missing information!” 
“You’re right, of course,” he ad- 
mitted. “But I’m damned if I see 
how it docs us any good.” 

“You idiot!” she shook him. “It 
clears the whole situation. It means 
that the computers cannot give ac- 
curate answers according to the 
symbolic logic tables unless they get 



full information. And you have 
proved two breakdowns in the in- 
escapable human element — the in- 
formation feeding— just like that!” 
She snapped her fingers. “It means 
we’ve got the whole computer-cult 
on the hip. I could kiss you again, 
you big goon.” She did so. 

“Cut it out,” he said. “I’m not 
made of brass.” 

She said, “Night soil,” amiably. 
What he might have done he was 
never to know, for a buzzer sounded 
and Nina moved quickly to a wall- 
talkie. She said. “All right, Bob, you 
say he’s clean?” Then, a moment 
later, “Better let him in and 
say his piece.” And, to Lindsay, 
“We’ve got company. Dmitri Alen- 
kov — met him?” 

Lindsay frowned. “You mean the 
Soviet charge d’affaires? I met him 
at the reception last week. Dreadful 
little lizard.” 

“Dmitri might surprise you,” she 
said enigmatically. 

Lindsay almost said night soil 
himself in exasperation. Instead 
and peevishly he asked, “Is there 
anybody you don’t know — inti- 
mately?” 

She laughed. “Of course,” she 
said, “I don’t know many women.” 

T HE SOVIET diplomat entered 
the bathroom. He was a languid 
mincing creature whose decadence 
glowed around him like phos- 
phorescence around a piece of 
rotted swampwood. He said, “I 
hope I am not intruding.” 

“That depends,” Nina told him. 
“I’d like to know how you traced 
us here so quickly.” 

“My sweet,” said the Russian in 




THE AMBASSADOR

intensely Oxford Esperanto, “you 
and your friend’s” — with another 
bow toward Lindsay — “little affair 
at the Pelican was witnessed this 
evening. When the two of you de- 
parted together, heading eastward, 
and Ambassador Lindsay could not 
be reached in his apartment . 

He paused delicately. 

So this, thought Lindsay, was a 
descendant of one of the Red Com- 
missars whose fanatic and chill 
austerity had terrorized the free 
world of a century ago. Lindsay 
knew something of modern Soviet 
history, of course. There had been 
no real counter-revolution. Instead 
the gradual emergence of the scien- 
tists over their Marxist political 
rulers had been a slow process of 
erosion. 

Once computer rule was inau- 
gurated in the North American Re- 
public and swept the Western 
World, the scientists had simply 
taken over real power. The once- 
powerful Politburo and its sub-com- 
mittees became obsolete. 

Alenkov was stressing this very 
point. He said, “So you see, we, the 
best blood of Russia, are forced by 
these machines to live the lives of 
outcast children. Naturally we re- 
sent it. And when, after so many 
long years of waiting, we learn that 
one man has succeeded in foiling 
the computers where no man has 
succeeded before, we want to know 
his secret. We must have it.” 

Nina spoke first. She said, 
“Dmitri, the secret, as you call it, 
has been right there all along for 
any of us to see. It just happens 
that Ambassador Lindsay fell into 
it head first.” 

“Thanks for the ‘Ambassador’ 



anyway,” Lindsay said drily. 

Nina quelled him with a frown. 
“The computer weakness,” she 
said, “lies in the human element. 
Now figure that out for yourself.” 
Alenkov’s brows all but met in 
the middle of his forehead and his 
mouth became a little round O un- 
der the twin commas of his mus- 
tache. He said, “I see.” 

He left shortly afterward on a 
note of sadness, rousing himself only 
to say to Lindsay, “Ambassador, 
you are a very lucky man.” His eyes 
caressed Nina’s near-nude figure. 

“That,” Lindsay told him, “is 
what you think.” 

When he had departed Lindsay 
suddenly realized he was exhausted. 
He sank back in a contour chair 
and let fatigue sweep over him. 
But Nina paced the bathroom floor 
like a caged cat. Finally she went 
to the wall-talkie, gave a number in 
a low voice. 

She pushed some sort of signal 
button several times, then swore 
and said, “Better not sleep now, 
boss. We’re cut off.” 

It brought him to with a start. 
“What do you mean?” he asked. 

“Somebody or something is jam- 
ming our communicator.” 

She opened a concealed cabinet, 
apparently part of the bathroom 
wall, drew from it a couple of light 
but deadly looking blasters, and 
tossed one onto the contour chain 
in front of him. “You know how to 
work one of these things?” she 
asked. 

“Better drop the weapons,” a 
quiet voice said from the doorway 
behind them. “You haven’t got a 
chance.” 

The speaker wore the light blue

tunicall that was the summer uni- 
form of the Army of the Republic 
of North America. His cap and 
shoulder-boards were bright with 
silver lace and he held a singularly 
ugly little automatic weapon 
cradled across one forearm. 

Nina and Lindsay dropped their 
weapons. But the girl’s back was 
up. Her slanting eyes crackled green 
fire as she said, “What right have 
you bastards got to come busting 
in here without a warrant?” 

“Sorry,” said the officer with 
chilling courtesy. “As it happens we 
do have a warrant. Remember, 
Miss Beckwith, this cottage is not 
United World’s soil.” He tossed an 
official looking document which 
Nina caught, motioned a couple of 
his men to pick up her weapons. 

“All right,” she said after scan- 
ning the warrant. “What do you 
want?” 

“Ambassador Lindsay,” was the 
reply. “We have been ordered to 
ensure that no harm comes to him 
while he is on American soil.” 

“I can read!” snapped the girl. 
“There’s going to be hell to pay 
over this.” Then, to Lindsay, “We 
can’t stop them now but they can’t 
hold you. I can see to that. Just try 
to keep your big dumb blundering 
self out of any extra trouble till we 
can take steps — will you promise 
me that, boss?” 

“I’ll try,” said Lindsay. 

HEY TOOK HIM to Washing- 
ton — or rather to Sherwood 
Forest, in Annapolis, where the 
summer White House sprawled 
over and beneath its landscaped 
acres. To a man from Mars it was

very green, very lush, very beauti- 
ful. 

Lindsay’s first impression of 
famed President Giovannini was 
that the famous elected leader of 
the North American Republic was 
composed mostly of secretaries. But 
at last one of them — the seventh or 
eighth — said gravely, “If you’ll just 
step this way, please,” to Lindsay 
and motioned for the Army officer 
to remain where he was. He was ad- 
mitted to the bathroom of the man 
who had sent for him so summarily. 

The president proved to be un- 
expectedly like some of the gover- 
nors of Lindsay’s home planet — in- 
cisive, unaffected, easily articulate. 
Physically he was stocky, of middle 
height, with a round, firmly fleshed 
sensitive face. He wore huaraches 
and bright blue shorts, no glasses or 
distortion harness. 

He waved Lindsay to a contour 
chair beside his own, said, “Sorry 
I had to have you hauled here this 
way. I was afraid you’d get killed 
if I didn’t. Do you have any idea 
of the uproar you’ve caused in the 
past two days, young man?” 
Lindsay, somewhat taken aback 
by the president’s abruptness, said, 
“Well, I knew some small groups 
were upset but . .” 

“Take a look,” the president told 
him, waving toward a quartet of 
vidar screens on the wall. Over one 
of them was the legend, New Or- 
leans, over another, New York, over 
a third, Los Angeles, over the 
fourth, Chicago. “Those are live 
shots,” Giovannini added. 

Lindsay was appalled. Each of 
them showed rioting crowds and 
defensive police action; the com- 
mentaries cried their confusion. 





THE AMBASSADOR

However, the Martian got the drift 
quickly enough. Apparently his re- 
cent activities had driven the neu- 
rotic Earthlings to violence. 

There appeared to be two chief 
factions. One of them, smashing 
and swarming and screaming its 
outrage, was demanding the abol- 
ishment of computer government. 
The other, equally violent and even 
more numerous, was after a villain 
named Zalen Lindsay. 

Seeing that Lindsay was begin- 
ning to understand what was hap- 
pening, the president pressed a but- 
ton that turned off all the vidar 
screens and voices. He said, “I 
could switch to any of our other 
cities — to cities in South America, 
India, Western Europe, England. 
They’re especially bitter toward you 
in England.” 

“I’m beginning to accept the fact 
— if not to understand,” said Lind- 
say. 

The president said, “Lindsay, 
from the point of view of your 
planet you have done nothing im- 
proper. But from the point of view 
of this planet . .” He let silence 
and a shrug of thick shoulders fin- 
ish the sentence. 

“I had no idea,” Lindsay began, 
“that conditions on Earth . He 
let his own voice trail off. 

Giovannini finished it for him. 
“You had no idea people on Earth 
were so damned neurotic,” he said, 
and sighed. Then, “Lindsay — call 
me Johnny, will you? All my 
friends do — Lindsay, for genera- 
tions now people by and large have 
been forfeiting confidence in them- 
selves to confidence in computers. 

“They have had good reason. 
Computer judgment has been re- 



sponsible for the first true age of 
world peace in history. It may not 
be healthy but it’s a damn sight 
healthier than war. And it has 
transformed this republic from an 
unwieldy group of states into a con- 
trolled anarchy that can be run by 
pushbuttons under ordinary condi- 
tions.” 

He paused while the Martian lit 
a cigarette, then went on with, 
“Thanks first to Sylac, then to 
Elsac, we learned that Vermont 
was happiest under its Town Meet- 
ing method, North Carolina needed 
its oligarchy, while my native state, 
California, is much better off di- 
vided in two. Texas became happy 
with its triple legislature — they 
never are happy unless they have 
a little more of everything down 
there. It was the same in other 
countries- — Canada, South Amer- 
ica, Spain. .” 

“And England?” Lindsay said 
softly. 

The president sighed again. 
“England,” he admitted, “is a bit 
of a problem — out of all proportion 
to its size and current importance. 
But the British are stubborn about 
their institutions. They’ve hung 
onto a Royal Family a hundred 
years longer than anyone else. We 
can hardly expect them to give up 
their beloved socialism so soon.” 

“Just as long as Mars is not ex- 
pected to pay for this indulgence, 
it’s quite all right with my peo- 
ple,” Lindsay told him. 

“What’s your first name — Za- 
len?” the president asked. “Well, 
Zalen, I know it’s a problem but 
we all have to give a little or crowd 
somebody out. Zalen, people are 
getting killed on account of you 




36 



SAM MERWIN, JR. 



right now.” 

“I’ve nearly been killed a couple 
of times myself.” 

“I know. Regrettable,” said Gio- 
vannini. “The UW crowd never 
has understood security. That’s 
why I had to kidnap you, Zalen. 
Couldn’t have you killed, you know. 
Not now anyway.” 

“Glad you feel that way, 
Johnny,” Lindsay told him drily. 
“But hasn’t it occurred to you that 
if people here are so easily set off 
it might be a good idea to knock 
out this computer business once 
and for all?” 

The president puffed on his ciga- 
rette. Then he said, “Zale, twenty 
years ago, maybe even ten, it could 
have been done. Now it’s too late. 
Which is why the ninety-billion- 
dollar investment in Giac. We’ve 
got to give them an absolute com- 
puter, one that will remove forever 
the basic distrust of computer judg- 
ment that underlies the neuroses 
you just mentioned.” 

“Quite possibly,” said Lindsay. 
“But I haven’t actually done a 
damned thing myself to undermine 
computer judgment. The mistakes 
have been made by the so-called 
experts who have fed their ma- 
chines inadequate information. 
Those mistakes were infantile. 
They suggest some sort of neurosis 
on the part of the feeders. They 
could be mistake-prone, you know.” 
President Giovannini chuckled 
again. “Of course they’re mistake- 
prone, Zalen,” he said. “Some of 
them, anyway. And it’s getting 
worse. That’s the real reason for 
Giac. Wait’ll you see it!” 

“You think I’m going to be 
around that long, Johnny?” Lind- 



say asked. “I understand I’m to be 
sent back to Mars — if I live that 
long.” 

“No, Lindsay, we need you — I’ll 
explain in a moment. And we 
aren’t going to let you die and be- 
come a martyr for generations of 
anti-computerites. We can’t have 
that now, can we?” 

“I’ll go along with you on it,” 
said Lindsay, wondering what the 
president was leading up to. 

“Good!” The president beamed 
at him. “Zalen — I want 3 vu to be 
the first person to put Giac through 
a public test. That’s how much I 
trust that machine. I want you, the 
man who has fouled up two com- 
puters, including Elsac, to try her 
out.” 



A ND LINDSAY could only nod. 

The governors of Mars might 
not approve but after the uproar 
he had caused on this mission they 
could hardly object. President Gio- 
vannini’s scheme was fully up to 
that renowned statesman’s reputa- 
tion for political astuteness. The 
more Lindsay thought it over the 
more beautiful was its simplicity. 

Mere word that he was to con- 
duct the first public test would 
quell the rioting. And unless Lind- 
say could show this mightiest of all 
symbolic logic computers to be falli- 
ble, computer rule would be en- 
trenched on Earth as never before. 

But what if, in some way, he 
succeeded in confounding the com- 
puter? Lindsay shuddered as he 
thought of the rioting he had so 
recently witnessed on the vidar- 
screens. 

His face must have revealed his

distress for the president said, 
“You’re worn out, Zalen. Can’t 
have that, you know. Not with the 
big test corning tomorrow.” 

Lindsay barely remembered leav- 
ing the president and being led to 
a sleeping chamber somewhere in 
the vast mansion. When he woke 
up it was dark and Nina was 
perched on the edge of his con- 
tour couch, looking unexpectedly 
demure in a grey bolo with white 
collar and cuffs. 

He said, as articulate as usual 
when she surprised him, “Hi.” 
“About time you woke up,” she 
said. “Do you know you snore?” 

“I can’t help it,” he told her. 
Then, coming fully awake, “How 
the devil did you get here?” 

“I walked,” she informed him 
succinctly. She stood up, her mag- 
nificent figure silhouetted against 
the light. “Better get dressed — 
your duds are over there.” She 
nodded toward a walldrobe. “I’ll 
wait in the bathroom.” She breezed 
out. 

When he looked at the clothing 
he was to wear he sensed that Nina 
had selected it for him. It was a lit- 
tle brighter in color, a little more 
daring in cut, than what he would 
have picked for himself. 

Nina was placing jewels care- 
fully in her hair, which she had re- 
leased to form a sleek halo around 
her magnificent head, when he en- 
tered the bathroom. A small pali- 
sade of glittering jeweled hairpins 
protruded from her mouth. She 
had shed her demure bolo and 
stood revealed in glittering black 
bodice-bra and evening skirt-clout. 

After placing the last jewel in 
her hair she swung about and said, 



“There — how do I look?” 

“Gorgeous,” he told her. 

“You look a bit dull,” she said. 
She dug a box out of a travel-bag 
placed in a corner of the room. 
“Here,” she said. “Put this on — left 
side.” 

“This” proved to be a magnifi- 
cent sunburst decoration, a glitter- 
ing diamond-encrusted star. He 
said, “What is it?” 

“Grand Order of the United 
Worlds — a fine diplomat you are! 
I picked it up for you this after- 
noon before flying here. Just stick 
it on. .” She came over, took it 
from him, pressed it firmly against 
his bolo till the suction grips caught 
hold. 

He put his arms around her. She 
let him hold her a moment, then 
pushed clear in the immemorial 
gesture of women dressed for a 
party who do not want to have 
their grooming mussed. “Not now,” 
she said. “We’ll have plenty of 
time.” 

“Not for what’s worrying me,” 
he said. “Nina, I’ve got to put Giac 
through its paces in front of the 
whole world tomorrow. And I don’t 
know what to ask it. I’ve got a 
blind spot where symbolic logic is 
concerned.” 

“Don’t fret yourself,” said the 
girl calmly. “I’m not worried about 
you. Not after what you’ve man- 
aged to do to all the other comput- 
ers you’ve faced. Come on — we’re 
having dinner with the president.” 

“Who the hell are you anyway?” 
he asked her bluntly. “You don’t 
even look the same.” 

She laughed. “I should hope 
not,” she told him. “After all, I 
could hardly grace the president’s 




38

table as a mere UW secretary — or 
as a New Orleans top model. Come 
on!” 

He went— and got his second 
shock when President Giovannini 
greeted Nina with a manner as 
close to obsequiousness as that pro- 
fessionally free-and-easy politician 
could muster. He said, “My dear 
Miss Norstadt-Ramirez. I do hope 
you’ll forgive me for ordering such 
summary action this morning. If 
I’d had the slightest idea. .” 

“I was boiling,” Nina told him. 
“I was just about ready to order 
Actnapolitan to pull the props out 
from under you when the riots 
started. Then I blessed your shiny 
little head and came up here.” 

“I am honored,” said the presi- 
dent. 



L INDSAY, walking through the 
proceedings in a fog, was even 
more laconic than a clipped British 
envoy who, along with a recovered 
Senator Anderson, was a member 
of the party. 

“Don’t take it so hard,” Ander- 
son whispered. “Nina is just about 
the best-kept secret in this hemi- 
sphere. If I weren’t one of the few 
who’s been in on it all along. .” 
He shrugged eloquently. 

Lindsay said nothing. He 
couldn’t. So Nina — his fresh slat- 
ternly secretary, the courtesan of 
the world capital — was also Cora- 
nina Norstadt-Ramirez, the heiress 
who owned almost half of Earth ! 

He felt like a quadruply-plated 
idiot. He knew about Norstadt- 
Ramirez — who didn’t, whether on 
Earth or Mars or the space-stations 
circling Venus while that planet’s 



atmosphere was being artificially 
altered to make it fit for human 
habitation? 

She was a fantastic glamorous 
lady of mystery, the ultimate heir- 
ess, the young woman to whom 
inexorably, thanks to North Amer- 
ica’s matriarchal era during the 
twentieth century, the control of 
most of its mightiest corporations 
and trust funds had descended. 

And she was Lindsay’s secretary. 
No wonder, he thought miserably, 
she had never sounded quite sin- 
cere about calling him boss. Why, 
she virtually owned his home planet 
as well. He watched her covertly 
across the table, poised, amused, 
alert, occasionally witty — and so 
damnably attractive. He wished he 
were dead. 

She caught his regard, scowled 
and stuck her tongue out at him. 
He thought, Why, you little. .! 

Somehow she got them out of the 
chatter after dinner, got him back 
to his suite. There, regarding him 
sternly, she said, “Zale, you aren’t 
going to be stuffy about this, are 
you?” 

“I can’t help it,” he replied. “If 
you’d only told me. .” 

He read sympathy in her green 
eyes. But she merely shrugged and 
said, “Result of a lifetime of keep- 
ing myself under wraps.” She sat 
on a contour chair, patted a place 
for him alongside. 

She said, “I’m the richest single 
person there has ever been — you 
know that. It isn’t my fault. It just 
happened. I didn’t deserve or want 
or need it. But it is a hell of a re- 
sponsibility. Since I’m responsible 
for so much it seemed important to 




THE AMBASSADOR

me to know how people felt. After 
all we act because we feel. And 
thanks to a few good friends like 
Fernando Anderson I’ve been able 
to get away with it.” 

“Why me?” he asked her. “Why 
pick on me?” 

Her expression softened. One of 
her hands crept into his. “One of 
the nicest things about you, Zale, is 
the fact that you don’t realise just 
how special you are.” 

“I’m not so special on Mars,” he 
told her. 

“No?” Her eyebrows rose de- 
lightfully. “A quarter of a billion 
Martians select you as their first 
Plenipotentiary to the UW and 
you’re not special? Zale, you’re an 
absolute woolly lamb. 

“There’s more to it than that. 
I’ve never been to Mars. I should 
have, but I simply haven’t had the 
time. So I decided the best way to 
find out about Mars at second hand 
was to work with you in some ca- 
pacity that would let you be your- 
self.” 

“A filthy, underhanded, thor- 
oughly feminine trick,” he said 
gently and kissed her. Then, frown- 
ing into her green eyes, “But why 
are you so dead set against comput- 
er judgment?” 

“Isn’t it obvious?” she asked. 
“I’ve got a tremendous stake in this 
world. Kicking around it as I have 
I’ve been able to see what is hap- 
pening. I’m damned if I’m going 
to have my property managed and 
run by a bunch of people who make 
mistakes because they’re too neu- 
rotic to make decisions. Look at 
them!” Her voice became edged 
with disgust. 

Lindsay said, “I see. Listen, 



honey, I’d like to sleep with you 
tonight.” 

She looked surprised but not dis- 
pleased by his bluntncss. “Of 
course, darling,” she told him. 

“How much will it cost me?” he 
asked her. 

She froze — then her eyes began 
to fill and she sniffled. He said, 
“You know I didn’t mean that. 
Dammit, I just wanted to show 
you you’re a neurotic yourself.” 

She slapped him hard enough to 
tilt him off the contour chair. She 
rose haughtily, still sniffing. Lind- 
say stretched out a hand and 
caught one of her ankles and 
tripped her up. She tottered, gave 
vent to a startled, “Awk,!”, fell 
backward into the pool-tub. 

He dived in after her, caught her 
when she came up, spluttering, 
gripped her shoulders hard. Her 
eyes blazed green fire at him. She 
said, “How dare you do that to me, 
you moron!” 

He said, “If I hadn’t I’d prob- 
ably never have seen you again.” 

She collapsed into his arms. 

Later — much later — as Nina was 
about to leave him for her own 
suite, he asked, “Honeycomb, what 
did you lose that caused Fernando 
to give you that necklace?” 

“I nearly lost you,” she replied 
from the doorway. “I bet him Ma- 
ria wouldn’t get you that night. 
And lost. So Fernando sent the 
necklace as compensation.” 

“Quite a large compensation,” 
said Lindsay drily. 

Nina shrugged. “Not for Fernan- 
do,” she told him. “After all, I pay 
him enough. He’s my number one 
political boy. ’Night, darling.”

SAM MERWIN, JR. 



L INDSAY was on the verge of a 
breakdown himself by noon 
the next day, after Computation 
Minister du Fresne, looking uglier 
than ever, had finished conducting 
President Giovannini’s official party 
through the rooms and passages of 
Giac. If Nina hadn’t been by his 
side during and after the swift 
rocket trip to Death Valley, he 
might have collapsed. 

It was she who had removed the 
glittering star from his breast be- 
fore breakfast in the Sherwood For- 
est mansion that morning. “You 
needed something to wear for show 
last night,” she had told him. 

“Then it’s not mine?” he had 
countered absently. 

“Of course it is,” she had assured 
him. “But Secretary General Ber- 
gozza is going to make the official 
investiture after the test.” 

Lindsay had meekly surrendered 
the bauble, barely noticing. His 
brain was straining to recall what 
he could of symbolic logic — a sub- 
ject that had never particularly in- 
terested him. For some reason it 
kept working back to Lewis Carroll, 
who, under his real name of 
Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, had 
been the founder of symbolic logic 
back in the nineteenth century, 
along with the renowned Dr. Poole. 

About all he could remember 
was the following problem: 

( 1 ) Every one who is sane can 
do Logic; 

(2) No lunatics are fit to serve 
on a jury; 

(3) None of your sons can do 
Logic. 

The Universal was “persons”. 
The symbols were: a — able to do 
Logic; b — fit to serve on a jury; c — 



sane; d — your sons. 

And the answer, of course, was: 
None of your sons is fit to serve on 
a jury. 

For some reason this, in turn, 
made him think of the ancient 
conundrum that employed con- 
fusion to trip its victims: What’s 
the difference between an iron dog 
in the side yard of a man who 
wants to give his little daughter 
music lessons but is afraid he can’t 
afford them next year, and a man 
who has a whale in a tank and 
wants to send him for a wedding 
present and is trying to pin a tag 
on him, saying how long he is, how 
much he weighs and where he 
comes from, but can’t because the 
whale keeps sloshing around in the 
tank and knocking the tag off? 

This time, the answer was: One 
can’t wag his tail, the other can’t 
tag his whale. 

“None of your sons is fit to tag a 
whale — or wag a tail,” he said ab- 
sently. 

“What was that?” Nina asked. 

“Nothing, nothing at all,” he re- 
plied. “Merely a man going out of 
his mind.” 

“It will never miss you,” she re- 
plied brightly. But her brightness 
became a bit strained as the day 
wore on. The trip, for Lindsay, was 
sheer nightmare. No sane man can 
wag his tail, he kept thinking. 

Even such fugitive grasping at 
Logical straws vanished when he 
saw the immense squat mass of 
Giac, rising like a steel-and-con- 
crete toad from the wastes of the 
California desert. It seemed absurd 
even to think that such an impos- 
ing and complex structure should 
have been reared on the mathe-

41 



matics of the immortal author of 
Alice in Wonderland , Through the 
Looking Glass and The Hunting of 
the Snark. 

For Giac was imposing, even to 
a man biased against computers 
from birth. Nor did du Fresne’s 
smugness help Lindsay’s assurance 
a bit. He explained how each of 
the block-large preliminary feed- 
ers worked — one for mathematical 
symbols, one for oral recording, a 
third for written exposition. Each 
worked simultaneously and in three 
different ways — via drum-memory 
banks, via punched tapes, via the 
new “ear-tubes” that responded to 
sound. 

Then there were the preliminary 
synthesizers, each of which unified 
in vapor-plutonium tubes the find- 
ings of its three separate feeders. 
Next, a towering black-metal giant 
filling three walls of a cubical room 
twenty metres in each dimension, 
came the final synthesizer, which 
coordinated the findings of the pre- 
liminary synthesizers and fed them 
into Giac itself. 

The master machine was the 
least imposing of all. It stood like 
an alabaster stele in the center of 
an immense chamber arranged like 
a theater-in-the-round. But du 
Fresne, peering through his straw- 
berry spectacles, said gloatingly, 
“Don’t be deceived by the size, 
ladies and gentlemen. All but what 
you see of Giac is underground. It 
is contained in an all-metal cell 
one million cubic metres in volume. 
And it is infallible.” 

Fortunately Lindsay was given a 
half hour of final preparation in 
one of the small offices with which 
the above-ground building was 



honeycombed. Nina came with 
him — by request. 

“I can’t do it,” he told her ab- 
ruptly. 

“Don’t worry, darling, you’ll 
think of something,” she said. She 
tried to embrace him but he was 
too worried to respond. After a- 
while she said, “Why not put a 
direct question. Ask it if it’s in- 
fallible.” 

“It could hardly tell a lie on it- 
self,” he replied. 

“What if such a question in- 
volved destruction of part of itself 
in the answer?” she asked. 

“It might — though I presume du 
Fresne and his boys have prepared 
it for such jokers. And anyway, 
what sort of question would do 
that? Got any ideas?” 

“That’s your department,” she 
said helpfully. “You’re the com- 
puter smasher of this team.” 

“But that was pure luck,” he 
said half-angrily. “One can’t wag 
his tail. The other can’t serve 
on a jury.” 

She looked alarmed. “Darling,” 
she said, “you aren’t — ” 

“Not yet, Honeycomb,” he said, 
“but give me time. 

“It’s got to be something about 
this Mars-Earth problem,” he went 
on after a long silence. “Listen: 
how can Mars develop if it’s in the 
spot of the Red Queen — has to run 
like hell just to stay where it is 
thanks to Earth’s dumping poli- 
cies?” 



T HE DOOR opened and closed 
and Maria Bergozza was with 
them. She said, “Apparently this is 
necessary.” She was holding a glass- 




42 



SAM MERWIN, JR. 



pellet gun in her hand, pointing it 
at Lindsay. 

He said, “Why, you — !” and 
moved toward her. Promptly the 
Secretary General’s daughter 
pointed the gun at Nina’s tanned 
midriff. He stopped. 

Maria said evenly, “It’s you that 
have done this to me, Nina. You’ve 
had all the fun while I’ve had to 
pour tea for papa at his damned 
functions. You’ve fouled up our 
plans with your meddling down in 
New Orleans. And now you’ve 
taken Zale, as you take everything 
else you take a fancy to.” 

“But you tried to kill him,” said 
Nina. “Why should you care?” 

“He would have been a martyr 
— and you wouldn’t have had 
him,” said Maria, her gun hand 
steady. “I know it’s going to ruin 
me to kill you-— but my whole life 
is ruined anyway. And this way at 
least I can sacrifice it for the 
cause.” 

“The cause of interplanetary 
war?” said Lindsay, in his turn in- 
credulous. Hot rage rose within 
him, “You third-rate tramp!” He 
stepped squarely into the line of 
fire, thrust his left breast in front 
of the muzzle of her gun. Behind 
him Nina screamed. 

But Maria didn’t fire. Instead 
she sneezed — sneezed and sneezed 
again. Her gun hand gyrated wildly 
as she doubled in a paroxysm and 
Nina moved past Lindsay to pluck 
the weapon from her. 

“Don’t call me — kmrashew ! — 
third-rate,” she managed to gasp 
before the blonde sent her sprawl- 
ing with a very efficient right cross 
to the chin. 

Nina turned on Lindsay angrily. 



“You damned fool!” she almost 
shouted. “You might have been 
killed.” 

He looked down, felt his knees 
turn to water. He said, “Omigod — 
I thought I was still wearing the 
star. I remembered how you saved 
my life in New Orleans with your 
diamond evening bag!” 

He sat down — hard. From the 

t 

floor Maria whimpered, “What are 
you going to do to me?” 

Nina said, “I ought to kill you, 
you know, but it would cause too 
much of a stink. So beat it and let 
us think. You’ll be hearing from 
me later. What you hear will de- 
pend on how you handle yourself 
from now on. Understand?” 

When she had slunk out Lindsay 
said, “What broke her up?” 

Nina dropped the gun into her 
bag casually, said, “Now I know 
you’re lucky, you thin slob. You 
happened to stumble right onto her 
allergy. She can’t stand being 
thought of as a third-rate lover. 
That’s why she’s always been jeal- 
ous of me— because I have top- 
model rating and she could never 
make it. She’s too damned con- 
cerned with pleasing herself to 
please anyone else. She flunked 
out at fourteen.” 

“Then why didn’t you pull it?” 
Lindsay asked her, astonished. 

“Because,” Nina said thought- 
fully, “I’m not conditioned to think 
that way. It’s horribly rude here on 
Earth to stir up other people’s aller- 
gies. As you reminded me last night, 
you rat, we’re all people in glass 
houses.” 

“But I didn’t even know. .” 
muttered Lindsay. 




THE AMBASSADOR

“You hit it though,” she re- 
minded him. “And you’re going to 
hit it again out there in exactly 
five minutes.” 



L INDSAY was extremely con- 
scious of the eyes of the vidar 
cameras upon him as President 
Giovannini, having finished his in- 
troductory speech, led him to the 
alabaster stele in the center of 
Giac’s great central chamber and 
turned him over to du Fresne, 
whose official robe hung unevenly 
from the hump of his harness. 

Lindsay handed the Minister of 
Computation the question he had 
prepared on paper, was brusquely 
told, “Read it please. Ambassador.” 
He cleared his throat and began. 
“I am asking a question highly 
pertinent to the welfare and future 
amity of the United Worlds,” he 
said slowly. More specifically to the 
future amity of Earth and Mars. 
It is a simple question without in- 
volved mathematical qualifications 
— but one that no computer and no 
man has thus far been able to an- 
swer correctly. 

“It is this continued failure of 
computers to come up with a logi- 
cal answer in the full frame of in- 
terplanetary conditions that has 
done much to make the people of 
my planet feel that no computer is 
trustworthy to make decisions in- 
volving human beings.” 

He paused, looked covertly at du 
Fresne, repressed a smile. The Min- 
ister of Computation was already 
showing signs of distress. He was 
shaking his head, making little 
pawing motions toward his glasses. 
“Here it is,” Lindsay said quick- 



ly. “Should the governors of Mars, 
whose responsibilities lie at least 
as much in the economic improve- 
ment of their own world as in inter- 
world harmony, permit their planet 
to receive goods which retard that 
economic development so that it 
becomes a race to maintain current 
unsatisfactory standards, merely 
because certain computers on 
Earth are fed false facts to permit 
continuation of some illogical form 
of government or social system — or 
should the governors of Mars per- 
mit their planet to suffer because 
of computer illogic in the name of 
a highly doubtful status quo on the 
parent planet?” 

He walked slowly back to his 
place and sat down, almost feeling 
the silence around him. Nina whis- 
pered. “What in hell does it 
mean?” 

Lindsay whispered back, “It’s a 
bit of the iron dog and the whale, 
a bit of the Red Queen, a bit of the 
suicide idea — and something else. 
Let’s see if it works.” 

Lindsay watched du Fresne, 
whose moment of triumph was 
marred by his obvious discomfort. 
The twisted little man was very 
busy running the question into its 
various forms for submission to the 
feeder units, whose mouths gaped 
like hungry nestlings along part of 
one side wall. 

If du Fresne failed him. 

It was a long nervous wait. 
Lights flickered in meaningless 
succession on subsidiary instrument 
boards and du Fresne darted 
about like a bespectacled buzzard, 
studying first this set of symbols, 
then that one. 

Lindsay glanced at Maria, who 




44 



SAM MERWIN, JR. 



sat huddled beside her father be- 
yond the president. To break the 
suspense he whispered to Nina, 
“What about her?” 

Nina whispered back, “I’ve got 
it taped. I’m going to give her a 
nice empty job on the moon — one 
with a big title attached. It will 
get her out of the way — she can’t 
do any harm there — and make her 
feel she’s doing something. Be- 
sides” — a faint malicious pause — 
“there are still four men to every 
woman on Luna. And they aren’t 
choosy.” 

“You’re a witch,” said Lindsay. 
He snickered and someone shushed 
him. Looking up he saw that 
things were happening. 

“In exactly” — du Fresne glanced 
up at a wall chronometer — “six 
seconds Giac will give its answer.” 

They seemed more like six years 
to Lindsay. Then the alabaster 
stele in the center of the floor came 
abruptly to life. A slow spiral of 
red, composed of a seemingly end- 
less stream of high mathematical 
symbols, started up from its base, 
worked rapidly around and around 
it like an old-fashioned barber- 
pole’s markings, moving ever up- 
ward toward its top. 

“Effective — very effective,” mur- 
mured President Giovannini. 

Suddenly a voice sounded, a 
pleasant voice specially geared to 
resemble the voice of the greatest 
of twentieth-century troubadors, 
Bing Crosby. It said, “Interplane- 
tary unity depends upon computer 
illogic.” 

There was a gasp — a gasp that 
seemed to emerge not only from the 
company present but, in reverse, 
through the vidarcasters from the 



entire listening world. President 
Giovannini, suddenly white, said 
inelegantly, “Son of a bitch!” 

Nina laughed out loud and 
gripped Lindsay’s arm tightly. 
“You’ve done it, darling — you’ve 
done it!” she cried. 

“On the contrary,” he said quiet- 
ly, “I haven’t done it; du Fresne 
did it.” And as he looked toward 
the Minister of Computation that 
little man fainted. 



B UT GIAC kept right on. It 
blanked out briefly, then once 
more the spiral of red figures be- 
gan to work its way around and 
up the stele. And once again the 
pleasant voice announced, “Inter- 
planetary unity depends upon 
computer illogic.” 

It blanked out, began again. 
And this time, from somewhere in 
the building, came the thud of a 
muffled explosion. A spiral of green 
symbols began to circle the stele, 
then a spiral of yellow. The red 
reached the top first and the Bing 
Crosby voice began again, “Inter- 
planetary unity de — ” 

The green and yellow spirals 
reached the top. A few seconds of 
sheer Jabberwocky emerged from 
the loudspeaker, ending in a chorus 
of, “Illogic, illogic, illogic. .” with 
the words overlapping. 

Panic began to show itself. The 
president gasped and Maria sud- 
denly shrieked. Frightened on- 
lookers crowded toward the door. 
The president looked from the ma- 
chine to Lindsay, bewildered. 

Lindsay got up and strode to- 
ward the microphone by the stele. 
He shouted into it, “Turn off the 




THE AMBASSADOR 



45 



computer — turn it off.” 

And, moments later, while the 
angry hot glow of the stele faded 
slowly, he said, “People of Earth, 
this is Lindsay of Mars. Please be 
calm while I explain. There is 
nothing wrong with Giac or any 
of your computers.” He paused, 
added ruefully, “At least nothing 
that cannot be repaired in short 
order where Giac is concerned. 

“I am going to ask to look once 
more at the question I submitted 
to this machine — and to the lan- 
guage tape fed into it by the Hon- 
orable Mr. du Fresne.” He waited 
while they were brought to him, 
scanned them, smiled, said, “No the 
fault was not with Giac. Nor was 
it consciously with Mr. du Fresne. 
The question was loaded. 

“You see, I happen to know that 
your Minister’s belief in computers 
is such that he suffers an involun- 
tary reaction when he hears them 
defamed. I defamed computers 
both in my preliminary address and 
in my question. And when he had 
to transfer to tape the phrase ‘ — or, 
should the Governors of Mars per- 
mit their planet to suffer because 
of computer illogic in the name of 
a highly doubtful status quo on the 
parent planet?’ — when he trans- 
ferred that sentence to tape he was 
physically unable to write the 
phrase ‘computer illogic’. 

“Involuntarily he changed it to 
‘computer logic’ with the result 
that the question was utterly mean- 
ingless and caused Giac’s tubes to 
short circuit. None of the recent 
computer failures was the fault of 
the machines — it was the fault of 
the men who fed them material 
to digest. 



“So I believe it is safe to say that 
you may rely upon your computers 
— as long as they do not deal with 
problems affecting yourselves and 
ourselves. For those you need hu- 
man speculation, human debate, 
above all human judgment!” 
President Giovannini, able poli- 
tician that he was, had joined Lind- 
say at the microphone, put an arm 
across his shoulders, said, “I feel 
humble — yes, humble — in the great 
lesson this great envoy from our 
sister planet had taught us. What 
they can do on Mars we can do 
on Earth.” 

When at last they were clear of 
the vidar cameras Lindsay grinned 
and said, “Nice going, Johnny — 
you’ll have more voters than ever 
come next election.” 

Giovannini simply stared at him. 
His eyes began to water, his nose 
to run and he turned away, grop- 
ing for an evapochief. 

Lindsay looked after him and 
shook his head. He said to Nina, 
who had rejoined him, “How about 
that? Johnny’s in tears.” 

“Of course he is,” snapped 
Nina. “He’s allergic to the word 
‘voters’. Night soil, but you’re sim- 
ple!” 

Lindsay felt his own eyes water. 
He sneezed, violently, for the first 
time since coming to Earth. Con- 
cerned, Nina said, “What’s wrong, 
darling? Have I done something?” 
“If you ever say ‘night soil’ 
again . .” he began. Then, “Krra- 
chooooo!” He felt as if the top of 
his head were missing. 

Nina hugged him, grinning like 
a gamine. “I’ll save it for very spe- 
cial occasions,” she promised.

Dark was the Ryzga mountain and forbidding; steep 
were its cliffs and sheer its crevasses. But its outward 
perils could not compare with the Ryzgas themselves, 
who slept within, ready to wake and conquer . 



WHEN 

THE MOUNTAIN 
SHOOK 



By Robert Abernathy 

Illustrated by Kelly Freas 



A T SUNSET they were in sight 
. of the Ryzga mountain. 
Strangely it towered among the 
cliffs and snow-slopes of the sur- 
rounding ranges: an immense and 
repellently geometric cone, black, 
its sides blood-tinted by the dying 
sun. 

Neena shivered, even though the 
surrounding cold could not reach 
her. The ice-wind blew from the 
glacier, but Var’s love was round 
her as a warming cloak, a cloak that 
glowed softly golden in the deepen- 
ing twilight, even as her love was 
about him. 

Var said, “The Watcher’s cave 



should be three miles beyond this 
pass.” He stood rigid, trying to 
catch an echo of the Watcher’s 
thoughts, but there was nothing. 
Perhaps the old man was resting. 
From the other direction, the long 
way that they two had come, it was 
not difficult to sense the thought of 
Groz. That thought was powerful, 
and heavy with vengeance. 

“Hurry,” said Neena. “They’re 
closer than they were an hour ago.” 

She was beautiful and defiant, 
facing the red sunset and the black 
mountain. Var sensed her fear, and 
the love that had conquered it. 
He felt a wave of tenderness and

bitterness. For him she had come to 
this. For the flame that had sprung 
between them at the Truce of New 
Grass, she had challenged the feud 
of their peoples and had left her 
home, to follow him. Now, if her 
father and his kinsmen overtook 
them, it would be death for Var, 
and for Neena living shame. Which 
of the two was worse was no longer 
a simple problem to Var, who had 
grown much older in the last days. 

“Wait,” he commanded. While 
she waited he spun a dream, attach- 
ing it to the crags that loomed over 
the pass, and to the frozen ground 
underfoot. It was black night, as 
it would really be when Groz and 
his henchmen reached this place; 
lurid fire spewed from the Ryzga 
mountain, and strange lights 
dipped above it; and for good 
measure there was an avalanche in 
the dream, and hideous beasts 
rushed snapping and ravening from 
the crevices of the rock. 

“Oh!” cried Neena in involun- 
tary alarm. 

Var sighed, shaking his head. “It 
won’t hold them for long, but it’s 
the best I can do now. Come on.” 

There was no path. Now they 
were descending the steeper face of 
the sierra, and the way led over bot- 
tomless crevasses, sheer drops and 
sheer ascents, sheets of traitorous 
glare ice. Place after place had to 
be crossed on the air, and both grew 
weary with the effort such crossings 
cost. They hoarded their strength, 
helping one another; one alone 
might never have won through. 

It was starry night already when 
they saw the light from the 
Watcher’s cave. The light shone 
watery and dim from beneath the 



hoary back of the glacier, and as 
they came nearer they saw why: 
the cave entrance was sealed by a 
sheet of ice, a frozen waterfall that 
fell motionless from the rocks 
above. They heard no sound. 

The two young people stared for 
a long minute, intrigued and fear- 
ful. Both had heard of this place, 
and the ancient who lived there to 
keep watch on the Ryzga mountain, 
as a part of the oldest legends of 
their childhood; but neither had 
been here before. 

But this was no time for shyness. 
Var eyed the ice-curtain closely to 
make sure that it was real, not 
dream-stuff : then he struck it bold- 
ly with his fist. It shattered and fell 
in a rain of splinters, sparkling in 
the light that poured from within. 



T HEY FELT the Watcher rouse, 
heard his footsteps, and finally 
saw him — a shrunken old man, 
white-haired, with a lined beardless 
face. The sight of him, more 
marred by age than anyone they 
had ever seen before, was disap- 
pointing. They had expected some- 
thing more — an ancient giant, a 
tower of wisdom and strength. The 
Watcher was four hundred years 
old ; beside him even Groz, who had 
always seemed so ancient, was like 
a boy. 

The Watcher peered at them in 
turn. “Welcome,” he said in a 
cracked voice. He did not speak 
again; the rest of his conversation 
was in thought only. “Welcome in- 
deed. I am too much alone here.” 
“You were asleep!” said Var. 
Shock made his thought accusing, 
though he had not meant to be. 




WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SHOOK 



49 



The old man grinned toothlessly. 
“Never fear. Asleep or awake, I 
watch. Come in! You’re letting in 
the wind.” 

Inside the cave it was warm as 
summer. Var saw with some sur- 
prise that all the walls were 
sheathed in ice — warm to the touch, 
bound fast against melting by the 
Watcher’s will. Light blazed in re- 
flections from the ice walls, till 
there was no shadow in the place. 
Behind them began a tinkling of 
falling water, thawed from the gla- 
cial ridges above to descend sheet- 
wise over the cave mouth, freezing 
as it fell into lengthening icicles. 
The old man gazed at his work for 
a moment, then turned question- 
ingly to the young pair. 

“We need a little rest out of the 
cold,” said Var. “And food, if you 
can spare it. We’re pursued.” 

“Yes, yes. You shall have what I 
can give you. Make yourselves com- 
fortable, and in one minute . 
Pursued, eh? A pity. I see the world 
is as bad as it was when I was last 
in it.” 

Hot food and drink were before 
them almost at once. The Watcher 
regarded them with compassion as 
their eyes brightened and some of 
the shadow of weariness lifted from 
them. “You have stolen your 
enemy’s daughter, no doubt, young 
man? Such things happened when 
I was young.” 

Warming to the old man now, 
Var sketched his and Neena’s his- 
tory briefly. “We should have been 
safe among my people by now. And 
before very long, I’m sure, I would 
have performed some deed which 
Groz would recognize as a worthy 
exploit, and would thus have healed 



the feud between our families. But 
our flight was found out too soon. 
They cut us off and forced us into 
the mountains, and now they are 
only a few hours behind us.” 

“A pity, indeed. I would like to 
help you — but, you understand, I 
am the Mountain Watcher. I must 
be above feuds and families.” 

Var nodded somberly, thinking 
that an old recluse would in any 
case be able to do little for them 
against Groz and his violent kins- 
folk. 

“And what will you do now?” 
Var grinned mirthlessly. “We 
haven’t much choice, since they’re 
overtaking us. I have only one idea 
left: we can go where Groz may 
‘fear to follow us.” 

“To the mountain, you mean.” 
“And into it, if need be.” 

The Watcher was broodingly si- 
lent; his eyes shifted to Neena, 
where she nestled by Var’s side. He 
asked, “And you — are you willing 
to follow your lover in this?” 

Neena returned his gaze without 
flinching; then she looked sidelong 
at Var, and her lips curled with a 
proud and tender mockery. “Fol- 
low? Why , I will lead, if his cour- 
age should fail him.” 

T HE OLD MAN said, “It is no 
part of my duty to dissuade you 
from this thing. You are free per- 
sons. But I must be sure that you 
know what you are doing. That is 
the second part of the law the First 
Watcher made: to guard lest the 
unwary and the ignorant should 
bring harm on themselves and on 
all men.” 

“We know the stories,” Var said 




50 



ROBERT ABERNATHY 



brusquely. “In the hollow heart of 
their mountain the Ryzgas sleep, as 
they chose to do when their world 
crumbled. But if they are wakened, 
the mountain will tremble, and the 
Ryzgas will come forth.” 

“Do you believe that?” 

“As one believes stories.” 

“It is true,” said the Watcher 
heavily. “In my youth I penetrated 
farther into the mountain than any- 
one before, farther even than did 
the First Watcher. I did not see the 
sleepers, nor will any man until they 
come again, but I met their sentries, 
the sentinel machines that guard 
them now as they have for two 
thousand years. When I had gone 
that far, the mountain began to 
shake, the force that is in the Earth 
rumbled below, and I returned in 
time.” Now for the first time Var 
sensed the power in the old man’s 
look, the power of four hundred 
years’ wisdom, Var stared down at 
his hands. 

“The Ryzgas also were men,” 
said the Watcher. “But they were 
such a race as the world has not 
seen before or since. There were ty- 
rannies before the Ryzgas, there 
was lust for power, and atrocious 
cruelty; but such tyranny, power, 
and cruelty as theirs, had never 
been known. They ruled the Earth 
for four generations, and the Earth 
was too little for them. They laid 
the world waste, stripped it of 
metals and feuls and bored to its 
heart for energy, poisoned its seas 
and its air with the fume of their 
works, wrung its peoples dry for 
their labor . and in each of those 
four generations they launched a 
ship of space. They were great and 
evil as no other people has been, be- 



cause they wanted the stars. 

“Because of them we must build 
with dreams instead of iron, and 
our only fire is that of the Sun, and 
even now, two thousand years later, 
the Earth is still slowly recovering 
from the pangs and poison of that 
age. If you turn up the sod in the 
plain where the wild herds graze, 
you will find numberless fragments 
of rusted or corroded metal, bits of 
glass and strange plastic substances, 
debris of artifacts still showing the 
marks of their shaping — the scat- 
tered wreckage of the things they 
made. And we — we too are a rem- 
nant, the descendants of the few 
out of all humanity that survived 
when the Ryzgas’ world went down 
in flame and thunder. 

“In the last generation of their 
power the Ryzgas knew by their 
science that the race of man would 
endure them no longer. They made 
ready their weapons, they mined 
the cities and the factories for 
destruction, making sure that their 
works and their knowledge would 
perish with them. Meanwhile they 
redoubled the yoke and the punish- 
ments, hastening the completion of 
the last of the starships. 

“From the memories that the old 
Watchers have left here, and from 
the memories of dead men that still 
echo in the air, I have gathered a 
picture of that world’s end. I will 
show it to you . 



V AR AND NEENA stared, un- 
stirring, with wide vacant eyes, 
while the old man wove a dream 
around them, and the bright ice- 
cave faded from their vision, and 
they saw— 




WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SHOOK 



51 



Black starless night, a sky of 
rolling smoke above the greatest 
city that was ever built. Only the 
angry light of fires relieved the 
city’s darkness — that, and the blue- 
white lightning flashes that silhou- 
etted the naked skeletons of build- 
ings and were followed by thunder 
and a shaking of the earth. 

Along lightless streets, half 
choked with rubble and with the 
dead, poured a mad, hating horde. 
The recurrent flashes lit scarred 
faces, naked bodies blackened and 
maimed fom the hell of the work- 
shops where the Ryzgas’ might had 
been forged, eyes that stared white 
and half sightless from the glare of 
the furnaces, gnarled hands that 
now at long last clutched the weap- 
ons of the last rebellion — a rebellion 
without hope of new life on a world 
gutted and smoldering from the ful- 
filment of the Ryzgas’ dream, with- 
out slogans other than a cry for 
blood. 

Before them death waited 
around the citadel where the mas- 
ters still fought. All round, from the 
lowest and most poisonous levels of 
the shattered city, the slaves 
swarmed up in their millions. And 
the lightning blazed, and the city 
howled and screamed and burned. 

Then, unbelievably, the thunder 
fell silent, and the silence swept out- 
ward like a wave, from ruined street 
to street. The mouths that had 
shouted their wrath were speech- 
less, and the rage-blinded eyes were 
lifted in sudden awe. From the cen- 
ter, over the citadel, an immense 
white globe soared upward, rising 
swiftly without sound. 

They had never seen its like, but 
they knew. It was the last starship. 



and it was leaving. 

It poised motionless. For an in- 
stant the burning city lay mute; 
then the millions found voice. Some 
roared ferocious threats and curses; 
others cried desolately- — ivait! 

Then the whole city, the dark 
tumuli of its buildings and its leap- 
ing fires and tormented faces, and 
the black sky over it, seemed to 
twist and swim, like a scene under 
water when a great fish sweeps past, 
and the ship was gone. 

The stunned paralysis fell apart 
in fury. Flame towered over the 
citadel. The hordes ran and 
shrieked again toward the central 
inferno, and the city burned and 
burned . 



V AR BLINKED dazedly in the 
shadowless glow of the ice-cave. 
His arm tightened about Neena till 
she gasped. He was momentarily 
uncertain that he and she were real 
and here, such had been the force 
of the dream, a vision of such scope 
and reality as Var had never seen — 
no, lived through — before. With 
deep respect now he gazed upon the 
bent old man who was the Moun- 
tain Watcher. 

“Some of the Ryzgas took flight 
to the stars, and some perished on 
Earth. But there was a group of 
them who believed that their time 
to rule would come again. These 
raised a black mountain from the 
Earth’s heart, and in hollows within 
it cast themselves into deathless 
sleep, their deathless and lifeless 
sentinels round them, to wait till 
someone dare arouse them, or until 
their chosen time — no one knows 
surely.

“I have told you the story you 
know, and have shown you a 
glimpse of the old time, because I 
must make sure that you do not 
approach the mountain in igno- 
rance. Our world is unwise and 
sometimes evil, full of arrogance, 
folly, and passion that are in the 
nature of man. Yet it is a happy 
world, compared to that the Ryzgas 
made and will make again.” 

The Watcher eyed them specula- 
tively. “Before all,” he said finally, 
“this is a world where you are free 
to risk wakening the old tyrants, if 
in your own judgment your great 
need renders the chance worth tak- 

• „ J J 

mg. 

Neena pressed her face against 
Var’s shoulder, hiding her eyes. In 
her mind as it groped for his there 
was a confusion of horror and pity. 
Var looked grimly at the Watcher, 
and would have spoken; but the 
Watcher seemed suddenly a very 
long way off, and Var could no 
longer feel his own limbs, his face 
was a numb mask. Dully he heard 
the old man say, “You are tired. 
Best sleep until morning.” 

Var strove to cry out that there 
was no time, that Groz was near 
and that sleep was for infants and 
the aged, but his intention sank and 
drowned under wave upon wave of 
unconquerable languor. The bright 
cave swam and dissolved; his eye- 
lids closed. 



AR WOKE. Daylight glim- 
mered through the ice of the 
cave mouth. He had been uncon- 
scious, helpless, for hours! At the 
thought of that, panic gripped him. 
He had not slept since childhood, 



and he had forgotten how it was. 

He came to his feet in one quick 
movement, realizing in that action 
that sleep had refreshed his mind 
and body — realizing also that a 
footstep had wakened him. Across 
the cave he faced a young man who 
watched him coolly with dark 
piercing eyes that were familiar 
though he did not know the face. 

Neena sat up and stifled a cry of 
fright. Var growled, “Who are you? 
Where’s the Watcher?” 

The other flashed white teeth in 
a smile. “I’m the Watcher,” he an- 
swered. “Often I become a youth 
at morning, and relax into age as 
the day passes. A foolish amuse- 
ment, no doubt, but amusements 
are few here.” 

“You made us fall asleep. Groz 
will be on us — ” 

“Groz and his people could not 
detect your thoughts as you slept. 
They were all night chasing elusive 
dreams on the high ridges, miles 
away.” 

Var passed a hand across be- 
wildered eyes. Neena said softly, 
“Thank you, Watcher.” 

“Don’t thank me. I take no sides 
in your valley feuds. But now you 
are rested, your minds are clear. Do 
you still mean to go on to the Ryzga 
mountain?” 

Not looking at the Watcher, Var 
muttered unsteadily, “We have no 
alternative.” 

There was a liquid tinkling as the 
ice-curtain collapsed; the fresh 
breeze of morning swept into the 
cave. The youth beckoned to them, 
and they followed him outside. 

The glacial slope on which the 
cavern opened faced toward the 
mountain. It rose black and forbid- 





WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SHOOK

ding in the dawn as it had by sun- 
set. To right and left of it, the grand 
cliffs, ocher and red, were lit splen- 
didly by the morning sun, but the 
mountain of the Ryzgas drank in 
the light and gave nothing back. 

Below their feet the slope fell 
away into an opaque sea of fog, fill- 
ing a mile-wide gorge. There was a 
sound of turbulent water, of a river 
dashed from rock to rock in its 
struggle toward the plain, but the 
curling fog hid everything. 

“You have an alternative,” said 
the Watcher crisply. The two took 
their eyes from the black mountain 
and gazed at him in sudden hope, 
but his face was unsmiling. “It is 
this. You, Var, can flee up the can- 
yon to the north, by a way I will 
show you, disguising your thoughts 
and masking your presence as well 
as you are able, while the girl goes 
in the other direction, southward, 
without seeking to conceal herself. 
Your pursuers will be deceived and 
follow her, and by the time they 
catch her it will be too late for them 
to overtake Var.” 

That possibility had not occurred 
to them at all. Var and Neena 
looked at one another. Then by 
common consent they blended their 
minds into one. 

They thought, in the warm in- 
timacy of unreserved understand- 
ing: “It would work: I-you would 
make the sacrifice of shame and 
mockery — yet these can be borne — 
that I-you might be saved from 
death — which is alone irreparable 
, . But to become I and you again 
— that cannot be borne.” 

They said in unison, “No. Not 
that.” 

The Watcher’s face did not 



change. He said gravely, “Very 
well. I will give you what knowl- 
edge I have that may help you 
when you enter the Ryzga moun- 
tain.” 

Quickly, he impressed on them 
what he had learned of the struc- 
ture of the mountain and of its 
guardian machines. Var closed his 
eyes, a little dizzied by the rapid 
flood of detail. 

“You are ready to go,” said the 
Watcher. He spoke aloud, and his 
voice was cracked and harsh. Var 
opened his eyes in surprise, and saw 
that the Watcher had become again 
the hoary ancient of last night. 

Var felt a twinge of unfamiliar 
emotion; only by its echo in Neena’s 
mind did he recognize it as a sense 
of guilt. He said stiffly, “You don’t 
blame us?” 

“You have taken life in your own 
hands,” rasped the Watcher. “Who 
does that needs no blessing and feels 
no curse. Go!” 



T HEY GROPED through the 
fog above blank abysses that 
hid the snarling river, crept hand 
in hand, sharing their strength, 
across unstable dream bridges from 
crag to crag. Groz and his pack, in 
their numbers, would cross the 
gorge more surely and swiftly. 
When Var and Neena set foot at 
last on the cindery slope of the 
great volcanic cone, they sensed 
that the pursuit already halved 
their lead. 

They stood high on the side of 
the Ryzga mountain, and gazed 
at the doorway. It was an opaque 
yet penetrable well of darkness, 
opening into the face of a lava cliff, 




54 



ROBERT ABERNATHY 



closed only by an intangible curtain 
— so little had the Ryzgas feared 
those who might assail them in their 
sleep. 

Var sent his thoughts probing be- 
yond the curtain, listened intently, 
head thrown back, to their echoes 
that returned. The tunnel beyond 
slanted steeply downward. Var’s 
hands moved, molding a radiant 
globe from the feeble sunshine that 
straggled through the fog-bank. 
With an abrupt motion he hurled 
it. The sun-globe vanished, as if the 
darkness had drunk it up, but 
though sight did not serve they both 
sensed that it had passed through to 
light up the depths beyond. For 
within the mountain something 
snapped suddenly alert — some- 
thing alive yet not living, seeing yet 
blind. They felt light-sensitive cells 
tingle in response, felt electric cur- 
rents sting along buried, long-idle 
circuits . 

The two stood shivering together. 

The morning wind stirred, fresh- 
ening, the fog lifted a little, and 
they heard a great voice crying, 
“There they are!” 

Var and Neena turned. Far out 
in the sea of fog, on a dream bridge 
that they could not see, stood Groz. 
He shook the staff he carried. It 
was too far to discern the rage that 
must contort his features, but the 
thought he hurled at them was a 
soundless bellow: “Young fools! 

I’ve caught you now!” 

Behind Groz the figures of his 
followers loomed up as striding 
shadows. Neena’s hand tightened 
on Var’s. Var sent a thought of 
defiance: “Go back! Or you’ll drive 
us to enter the mountain !” 

Groz seemed to hesitate. Then 



he swung his staff up like a weapon, 
and for the two on the mountain- 
side the world turned upside down, 
the mountain’s black shoulder hung 
inverted above them and the dizzy 
gulf of sky was beneath. Var fought 
for footing with his balance gone, 
feeling Neena reel against him until, 
summoning all his strength, he 
broke the grip of the illusion and 
the world seemed to right itself. 
The mist billowed again and Groz 
was out of sight, but they could 
hear him exhorting his men to 
haste. 

Neena’s face was deadly pale and 
her lips trembled, but her urgent 
whisper said, “Come on!” 

Together they plunged into the 
curtain of darkness. 



A T VAR’S thought command 
Neena froze instantly. “Feel 
that!” he muttered, and she, lis- 
tening, sensed it too: the infinites- 
imal trickle of currents behind 
what appeared to be a blank tunnel 
wall, a rising potential that seemed 
to whisper Ready . ready . 

The sun-globe floated behind 
them, casting light before them 
down the featureless tunnel that 
sloped always toward the moun- 
tain’s heart. Var summoned it, and 
it drifted ahead, a dozen feet, a 
little more — 

Between wall and wall a blinding 
spindle of flame sprang into being, 
pulsed briefly with radiant energy 
that pained the eyes, and went out. 
The immaterial globe of light 
danced on before them. 

“Forward, before the charge 
builds up again!” said Var. A few 
feet further on, they stumbled over 




WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SHOOK 



55 



a pile of charred bones. Someone 
else had made it only this far. It 
was farther than the Watcher had 
gone into these uncharted regions, 
and only the utmost alertness of 
mind and sense had saved them 
from death in traps like this. But as 
yet the way was not blocked . 

Then they felt the mountain be- 
gin to tremble. A very faint and re- 
mote vibration at first, then an in- 
creasingly potent shuddering of the 
floor under their feet and the walls 
around them. Somewhere far be- 
low immense energies were stirring 
for the first time in centuries. The 
power that was in the Earth was 
rising; great wheels commenced to 
turn, the mechanical servitors of 
the Ryzgas woke one by one and be- 
gan to make ready, while their mas- 
ters yet slept, for the moment of re- 
birth that might be near at hand. 

From behind, up the tunnel, 
came a clear involuntary thought 
of dismay, then a directed thought, 
echoing and ghostly in the confine- 
ment of the dark burrow: 

“Stop ! — before you go too far!” 
Var faced that way and thought 
coldly: “Only if you return and let 
us go free.” 

In the black reaches of the shaft 
his will groped for and locked with 
that of Groz, like the grip of two 
strong wrestlers. In that grip each 
knew with finality that the other’s 
stubbornness matched his own — • 
that neither would yield, though 
the mountain above them and the 
world outside should crumble to 
ruin around them. 

“Follow us, then!” 

They plunged deeper into the 
mountain. And the shaking of the 
mountain increased with every step, 



its vibrations became sound, and its 
sound was like that of the terrible 
city which they had seen in the 
dream. Through the slow-rolling 
thunder of the hidden machines 
seemed to echo the death-cries of a 
billion slaves, the despair of all flesh 
and blood before their monstrous 
and inhuman power. 

Without warning, lights went on. 
Blinking in their glare, Var and 
Neena saw that fifty paces before 
them the way opened out into a 
great rounded room that was like- 
wise ablaze with light. Cautiously 
they crept forward to the threshold 
of that chamber at the mountain’s 
heart. 

Its roof was vaulted; its circular 
walls were lined with panels 
studded with gleaming control but- 
tons, levers, colored lights. As they 
watched light flicked on and off in 
changing patterns, registering the 
progressive changes in the vast 
complex of mechanisms for which 
this must be the central control 
station. Behind those boards cir- 
cuits opened and closed in bewilder- 
ing confusion ; the two invaders felt 
the rapid shifting of magnetic 
fields, the fury of electrons boiling 
in vacuum . 

For long moments they forgot 
the pursuit, forgot everything in 
wonder at this place whose remotest 
like they had never seen in the sim- 
plicity of their machineless culture. 
In all the brilliant space there was 
no life. They looked at one another, 
the same thought coming to both 
at once: perhaps, after two thou- 
sand years, the masters were dead 
after all, and only the machines 
remained? As if irresistibly drawn, 
they stepped over the threshold.

ROBERT ABERNATHY 



There was a clang of metal like 
a signal. Halfway up the wall oppo- 
site, above a narrow ramp that de- 
scended between the instrument 
panels, a massive doorway swung 
wide, and in its opening a figure 
stood. 

Var and Neena huddled frozen- 
ly, half expecting each instant to 
be their last. And the Ryzga too 
stood motionless, looking down at 
them. 



H E WAS a man of middle 
height and stocky build, clad 
in a garment of changing colors, of 
fabric delicate as dream-stuff. In 
his right hand, with the care one 
uses with a weapon, he grasped a 
gleaming metal tube; his other 
hand rested as for support against 
the frame of the doorway. That, 
and his movements when he came 
slowly down the ramp toward them, 
conveyed a queer suggestion of 
weariness or weakness, as if he were 
yet not wholly roused from his two 
millenia of slumber. But the Ryzga’s 
manner and his mind radiated a 
consciousness of power, a pride and 
assurance of self that smote them 
like a numbing blow. 

With a new shock, Var realized 
that the Ryzga’s thoughts were 
quite open. They had a terse, dis- 
connected quality that was strange 
and unsettling, and in part they 
were couched in alien and unin- 
telligible symbols. But there was no 
block. Apparently the Ryzga felt no 
need to close his mind in the pres- 
ence of inferior creatures . 

He paused with his back to the 
central control panel, and studied 
the interlopers with the dispassion- 



ate gaze of a scientist examining a 
new, but not novel, species of in- 
sect. His thoughts seemed to click, 
like metal parts of a mechanism 
falling into places prepared for 
them. The image occurred oddly to 
Var, to whom such a comparison 
would ordinarily have been totally 
strange. 

“Culture: late barbarism. Hand- 
work of high quality — good. Phys- 
ically excellent stock . .” There 
was a complicated and incompre- 
hensible schemata of numbers and 
abstract forms. “The time: two 
thousand years — more progress 

might have been expected, if any 
survivors at all initially postulated; 
but this will do. The pessimists were 
mistaken. We can begin again.” 
Then, startlingly super-imposed on 
the cool progression of logical 
thought, came a wave of raw emo- 
tion, devastating in its force. It was 
a lustful image of a world once 
more obedient, crawling, laboring 
to do the Ryzgas’ will — toward the 
stars, the stars! The icy calculation 
resumed: “Immobilize these and 
the ones indicated in the passage 
above. Then wake the rest . .” 

Var was staring in fascination at 
the Ryzga’s face. It was a face 
formed hy the custom of unques- 
tioned command; yet it was lined 
by a deeply ingrained weariness, 
the signs of premature age — denied, 
overridden by the driving will they 
had sensed a moment earlier. It 
was a sick man’s face. 

The Ryzga’s final thought clicked 
into place : Decision! He turned to- 
ward the switchboard behind him, 
reaching with practised certainty 
for one spot upon it. 

Neena screamed. 




WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SHOOK 



57 



Between the Ryzga and the con- 
trol panel a nightmare shape reared 
up seven feet tall, flapping black 
amorphous limbs and flashing red 
eyes and white fangs. The Ryzga 
recoiled, and the weapon in his 
hand came up. There was an in- 
stantaneous glare like heat light- 
ning, and the monster crumpled in 
on itself, twitched briefly and van- 
ished. 

But in that moment a light of 
inspiration had flashed upon Var, 
and it remained. As the Ryzga 
stretched out his hand again, Var 
acted. The Ryzga froze, teetering 
off balance and almost falling, as a 
numbing grip closed down on all 
his motor nerves. 

Holding that grip, Var strode 
across the floor and looked straight 
into the Ryzga’s frantic eyes. They 
glared back at him with such hatred 
and such evil that for an instant he 
almost faltered. But the Ryzga’s 
efforts, as he strove to free himself 
from the neural hold, were as mis- 
directed and unavailing as those of 
a child who has not learned to 
wrestle with the mind. 

Var had guessed right. When 
Neena in her terror had flung a 
dream monster into the Ryzga’s 
way — a mere child’s bogey out of a 
fairy tale — the Ryzga had not re- 
cognized it as such, but had taken 
it for a real being. Var laughed 
aloud, and with great care, as one 
communicates with an infant, he 
projected his thoughts into the 
other’s mind. “There will be no 
new beginning for you in our world, 
Ryzga! In two thousand years, 
we’ve learned some new things. 
Now at last I understand why you 
built so many machines, such com- 



plicated arrangements of matter 
and energy to do simple tasks — it 
was because you knew no other 
way.” 

Behind the hate-filled eyes the 
cold brain tried to reason still. 
“Barbarians . ? Our party was 
wrong after all. After us the ma- 
chine civilization could never rise 
again, because it was a fire that 
consumed its fuel. After us man 
could not survive on the Earth, be- 
cause the conditions that made him 
great were gone. The survivors 
must be something else— capacities 
undeveloped by our science- — after 
us the end of man, the beginning 
. But those of us who chose to die 
were right.” 

The tide of hate and sick desire 
rose up to drown all coherence. The 
Ryzga made a savage, wholly futile 
effort to lift the weapon in his para- 
lyzed hand. Then his eyes rolled up- 
ward, and abruptly he went limp 
and fell in a heap, like a mechanical 
doll whose motive power has failed. 

Var felt Neena beside him, and 
drew her close. As she sobbed her 
relief, he continued to look down 
absently at the dead man. When at 
last he raised his head, he saw that 
the drama’s end had had a further 
audience. In the outer doorway, 
backed by his clansmen, stood Groz, 
gazing first in stupefaction at the 
fallen Ryzga, then with something 
like awe at Var. 

Var eyed him for a long moment; 
then he smiled, and asked, “Well, 
Groz? Is our feud finished, or does 
your ambition for a worthy son-in- 
law go beyond the conqueror of the 
Ryzgas?” 



• • • THE END 




The social engineer was only doing his duty when he tried to 
force Lansing out of his rut of habit and routine. He forgot 
that ruts themselves have a habit of turning in surprising 
directions! 



ACT of PASSION 

By Raymond E. Banks 

Illustrated by Paul Orban 



R. LANSING rose at 6:10 as 
usual that morning, dressed, 
ate a poached egg for breakfast 
and paused for a moment before a 
mirror before he put on his old- 
fashioned hat. 

Ought to do something about 
those gray hairs, he thought. Plenty 
of men his age used Dyall ; it would 
make him look ten years younger. 
But some naturalistic, unhypocriti- 
cal streak inside him made him put 
on his hat with a sigh and give up 
the thought as he had almost every 
morning for a year. 

He selected three luxurious 
South American cigars from his 
humidor and made a mental note 
to stop at the tobacconist’s at noon 
to replenish the supply, according 
to his habit. 

He lit one, put the other two in 
his pocket, and caught the 7:10 to 



the city. Aboard the commuter’s 
aircar he shoved a nickel in the slot, 
pulled out a facsimile paper and 
fell to studying the stock-market, 
especially his small Martian hold- 
ings and those new Venusian 
stocks that he had an eye on. 

“Your attention please! No smok- 
ing on the aircar!” The robot voice 
brushed uselessly against his ear as 
it did every morning. He continued 
to smoke, conscious of the envy of 
the other commuters who smoked 
less expensive brands. But they 
were married men who couldn’t 
afford such extravagance. 

At the office he smiled good 
morning to his friends and sank 
into his place at the head of the 
Accounting Department. The new- 
est computing machines in the of- 
fice glowed on his desk; his swivel 
chair bore the largest, thickest seat

pad even though his flanks were 
thin. It had taken him twenty years 
to achieve this comfortable status, 
and he sighed in delight at the de- 
licious, knotty problems of the day 
lying before him. 

Then came the interruption. 

It came in the form of a small 
note that shot out of a communica- 
tions cylinder on the side of his 
desk. 

“Under the provisions of Par 3b 
of the Social Nonconformity Act, 
you, Franklin G. Lansing, will re- 
port to your social engineer with- 
out a second’s delay. Urgent. 
Signed Watkins, Social Engineer, 
Ward Seven.” 

Lansing made a sound in his 
throat which might have been a 
growl or might have been a snort. 



W ATKINS, his social engi- 
neer, had offices on the third 
floor of the Haymarket Building. 
Lansing stepped into the anti-grav- 
ity device and out again to find 
himself in a sumptious, institutional 
office. The furnishings struck him 
as decadent and the other patients 
sat around gloomily, creating an 
air of tension similar to that of a 
doctor’s office. 

As a man with a secure job, 
money in the bank and a way of 
life that he liked, he did not act 
deferential when he faced Watkins 
across the broad, shiny desk. 

“What’s wrong with my adjust- 
ment?” he asked without preamble. 
“I never have to come in except for 
the yearly check-ups.” 

Watkins was a rotund man with 
piercing blue eyes. He regarded 
Lansing’s thin, neatly-dressed fig- 



ure with suspicion. 

“I’m afraid that’s just the trou- 
ble,” he said. “My social engineer- 
ing reporters have been watching 
you, Lansing. Since the death of 
your sister, you’ve lived alone and 
liked it. You rise at a certain hour, 
eat your meals at the same places 
and turn in at a certain hour. Like 
an automaton. It’s dangerous.” 

Lansing let out a strangled 
squawk. “With all the people in 
New York that are getting into 
trouble because of poor adjustment 
I’d think you’d let a well-adjusted 
person alone. I’d think — ” 

Watkins held out a firm, fat 
hand. 

“Give me the key to your apart- 
ment.” 

_ Lansing felt the blood drain from 
his face. 

“Non-compulsion!” he gasped. 

“Exactly. It’s our job to see that 
people like you don’t crack up. 
Your kind is the most dangerous. 
A few days ago a man who’d never 
been in a speck of trouble all his 
life stole twenty thousand dollars 
and eloped with his secretary, a 
married woman. Thus he ruined 
three lives — his own, the woman’s 
and her husband’s. Last week a 
man who had lived in the same 
place for twenty-five years and 
never caused any one trouble went 
out on the street and killed three 
people with a gun. People who 
were strangers — that he’d never 
seen before. His excuse was that he 
didn’t like redheaded people. Ob- 
viously a case of long, slow de- 
terioration. 

“The whole purpose and mean- 
ing of the Social Nonconformity 
Act is to prevent these horrors. 




ACT OF PASSION 



61 



You, now, you have a compulsion 
to orderliness that is near insanity. 
You revel in routine. But the hu- 
man mind and body cannot stand 
this supernatural order. Sooner or 
later you’re going to crack as a re- 
sult of your compulsion to drab 
order. We prevent that by forcing 
you into non-compulsion and 
breaking the routine of your life 
which you would be bound to 
break in a more dangerous way 
later. 

“Commit your act of passion 
now, Lansing, before it grows into 
one that is uncontrollable and dis- 
astrous!” 

The social engineer flung the 
non-compulsion license on his desk 
in front of Lansing. 

“But — but,” cried Lansing. “I 
don’t want to commit any act of 
passion. I’m happy. I — ” 

The social engineer shook his 
head. “After all, Lansing, we’re all 
human. And how long has it been 
since you’ve — ah — been in the com- 
pany of a woman? How long since 
you’ve gotten drunk or had a real 
argument? No — you’ll have to give 
me the key to your apartment.” 

Watkins’ expression was tri- 
umphant and firm. Lansing, feeling 
like the Earth had been shot out 
from under him, handed over the 
key to his apartment and picked 
up the non-compulsion license. 

I N A BAR, near the Haymarket 
Building he ordered an unaccus- 
tomed early morning drink. When 
the bartender saw the non-compul- 
sion certificate projecting from his 
pocket he slid another drink along 
the bar. 



“Better have another, Buster. On 
the house. I been in that mess my- 
self. In my case they made me at- 
tend lectures and concerts and 
join the Chamber of Commerce.” 

“I wish mine were that easy,” 
said Lansing. Then he had another 
thought and called Mr. Hedges. 
Hedges was the district social en- 
gineer over Watkins. He was not a 
close friend, because Lansing dis- 
liked social engineers, but he had 
done Hedges’ income tax for a 
number of years. Lansing worded 
his appeal carefully, hinting that 
Watkins was probably more than 
stupid. 

“ ’Fraid there’s nothing I can 
do,” said Hedges. “It’s true that 
people like you who run along 
quietly in a rut are likely to break 
down. There are exceptions, of 
course, but Watkins is within the 
law. Best thing to do is get it over 
with in a hurry.” The man’s hands 
sawed the air. “Do something big,” 
he suggested and rang off. 

I ANSING slipped into the bank 
■“ aware that a couple of shadows 
that must be social engineering 
reporters followed wherever he 
went. An unaccustomed revolver 
weighted down his coat on one 
side. The gun was hot and he felt 
miserable. He hated scenes any- 
way, but — 

Lansing took his place in a wait- 
ing line, still bound by his sense of 
propriety and order. The bank 
buzzed with activity, the lines mov- 
ing with peristaltic life; a baby 
squalled, somebody coughed and 
the sunlight yellowed on the black 
marble desks. 




62 



RAYMOND E. BANKS 



As usual, there was a man who 
had to purchase traveler’s checks, 
so that the line Lansing chose 
moved slowest of all. People who 
had come in after him were serv- 
iced and left again. After an in- 
terminable wait he reached the 
window, his legs a little numbed 
from standing. He felt that the 
whole thing was already going 
badly. 

“I’m afraid this is a robbery,” he 
told the teller, pointing the gun at 
her. He felt miserable, standing 
there with the gun in his hand, ex- 
pecting the guards to move in and 
shoot without asking questions. 

The girl’s eyes widened and then 
she saw the bit of green in his 
pocket. 

“Non-compulsion?” 

“Uh, yes. Please put up your 
hands.” 

“How can I give you money if I 
put up my hands?” 

“Do as I say,” frowned Lansing, 
his knuckles white on the gun. 

The girl lifted her hands. Lan- 
sing turned around to the people 
behind him. 

“This is a robbery,” he said. “Er 
— non-compulsion. Please put up 
your hands.” 

Instead of complying, the people 
stared at him dully and then, with 
resignation, moved over to the 
other lines. A buzzer, sharp, in- 
sistent, rang out twice. The em- 
ployees froze. 

“Everybody hands up!” shouted 
someone. “Non-compulsion.” All 
employees’ hands went up. The 
people waiting shot dirty looks at 
Lansing, knowing this meant de- 
lay. They did not raise their hands. 
The bank guard frowned and 



stepped outside the bank as re- 
quired by custom, but remained 
glowering through the window to 
make sure it was a real non-com- 
pulsion. Somewhere a police car’s 
siren began to wail, coming closer. 

The girl at the desk counted out 
two twenties and a ten. “Fifty is 
usual,” she said. Then she quickly 
thrust up her hands again as he 
shoved the gun at her. He pock- 
eted the money with one hand, 
feeling like a small boy standing 
before a class and reciting. 

“Thanks,” he said, starting to 
move away. He wanted to get out 
in a hurry. 

“Wait a minute, mister,” she said 
harshly. “I got to have the number 
of your non-compulsion license so 
we can get the money back.” 

For the first time, Lansing began 
to feel somewhat unadjusted. “Ask 
the social engineers,” he snapped. 
“They got me into this. They can 
pay.” He strode out of the bank. 

A police riot squad was pulled up 
outside. The police stood around 
in hard-eyed silence, watching him 
sullenly. They didn’t like non- 
compulsion either. Lansing, feeling 
sillier than he could ever remem- 
ber, tossed his empty gun at a de- 
tective. 

“Here, go shoot up a social engi- 
neer,” he said miserably and 
walked off down the sunlit street, 
his face burning with shame and 
sensitivity. If non-compulsion was 
supposed to stir up emotions, he 
was off to a good start. 

S HE WAS SMALL and graceful 
and blonde. Almost pretty, ex- 
cept that there were crow’s feet

around her eyes and mouth. But she 
would do. 

She showed surprise as he sat 
down at her lonely table. In the 
Terrace Room at the Kensington 
Hotel, lunch costs six dollars a plate, 
and you didn’t sit at a stranger’s 
table uninvited. A frowning waiter 
was coming towards him across the 
room and sunlight gleamed on the 
rug and sparkled from the heavy 
linen and silver. 

“What is the meaning of this?” 
said the woman, with hostility. 

Lansing was forced to drop his 
eyes from the clear gaze. “Non- 
compulsion,” he muttered, his eyes 
darting to the unaccustomed lux- 
ury of the millionaire’s hotel. He 
usually had lunch at Eddie’s 
where all was noise and clatter, and 
you were served by robot waiters. 
It made him feel uneasy to have a 
real, human waiter standing there, 
one of a vanishing race. 

“Is this man giving you trouble, 
Ma’m?” asked the waiter. 

The woman laughed a silvery 
laugh. “Don’t be ridiculous,” she 
told the waiter. She regarded Lan- 
sing with amusement. “I had fun 
on my non-compulsion,” she said, 
“and I wouldn’t spoil yours.” 

Lansing held the menu with the 
same white knuckles that had 
gripped the unaccustomed gun. He 
had hoped she would drive him 
away. Even the menu bothered 
him. He was used to ordering from 
an electronic menu where you 
punched keys, not something writ- 
ten in French. 

“Give me — the works,” he told 
the waiter self-consciously. Then he 
sat there brooding while the waiter 
and the woman, whose name, he 



learned, was Doris Woodring, 
argued about his luncheon. He was 
sullenly aware of the two human 
bloodhounds that were the social 
engineering reporters just slipping 
into the far corner of the room. 

The food was very rich, and 
tasty, and Mrs. Woodring chatted 
with the easy social grace of the 
leisured. When Lansing mentioned 
his Martian holdings, they found 
a subject of common interest, for 
her husband was in finance. Sud- 
denly the luncheon was quite en- 
joyable. 

“But then,” laughed Mrs. Wood- 
ring, “that belongs to the part of 
your life you’re trying to break 
away from. We should be talking 
about love instead.” 

“Love?” he asked blushing, the 
flow of his enjoyment brought to a 
sudden halt. 

Her teeth sparkled in a smile as 
she blew pale blue cigarette smoke 
against the dense fog from his 
South American cigar. 

“Well, after all, from what you 
say, your social engineer will expect 
you to have a fling with women, 
you being a bachelor.” 

“Er-fling — yes,” he said running 
a finger inside his collar. “What do 
you think we ought to do?” 

“Go somewhere where we can be 
alone, I suppose,” she said, drop- 
ping her eyes to her plate. “I was 
going to a meeting of Concen- 
trated Charities this afternoon, but 
it isn’t important. We can go to 
my town apartment. .” 

Lansing felt fear coursing 
through his body. His experiences 
with women had been few and not 
exciting. And when Mrs. Woodring 
stood up so that he got a good 




64 



RAYMOND E. BANKS 



look at her and the way she han- 
dled her trim body, he became 
more frightened. It was obvious 
that her sleekness meant experi- 
ence. 

A walk in the fresh sunshine of 
the park and a couple of drinks 
at a bar and they were admitted 
by a real, human servant to her 
uptown apartment. Mrs. Wood- 
ring went off to get some drinks 
and Lansing paced impatiently up 
and down. 

No! They asked too much. It was 
really too embarrassing. He flung 
himself to the television phone. Be- 
side it was an address book. He 
fumbled with the pages, his heart 
beating in determination. 

He found the number he wanted 
and dialed. 

“Get me Mr. Woodring,” said 
Lansing imperatively to the girl on 
the telephone. “It’s urgent.” 

Presently he was looking at a 
pleasant-faced man with dancing 
blue eyes, much like his wife’s. 

“There’s a man in your uptown 
apartment with your wife,” he 
gasped. “There’s a — uh — man in 
your — uptown apartment.” 

Woodring looked puzzled. “What 
man?” 

“Me,” said Lansing in deter- 
mined, self-defensive anger. 

Woodring studied him in suspi- 
cion and dislike for a second. Then 
the clouds broke and he smiled. 
“Oh,” he said. “Well, thanks for 
the call. Would appreciate it if 
you’d lay off my brandy, old boy. 
It’s a little low.” 

Woodring had seen the corner 
of the non-compulsion license 
sticking from Lansing’s pocket. 

“But — but — ” said Lansing. 



“Don’t worry,” said Woodring. 
“Everything will be all right. 
You’ll be all right. Excuse me, old 
boy, got lots of work to do—” 
And Woodring rang off. Lansing 
sat there, feeling his inner palms 
sweat. 



CHE CAME BACK to the room 
without the servant but with the 
drinks. She was wearing a silver 
thing that could have been a 
house costume and could have been 
pajamas. It was silken and seduc- 
tive. When she bent to pour, it was 
obvious that there wasn’t much 
else. 

Lansing saw a button and 
punched in desperation. 

“What did you do that for?” she 
asked, sitting beside him on the 
sofa. 

“I want — uh — brandy,” he 
gulped. 

The closed-mouthed servant ap- 
peared. “Brandy,” Lansing or- 
dered, trying to control his voice. 
“Er — brandy.” He tried desper- 
ately to think of some other reasons 
to keep the servant in the room. 
He could think of none. The serv- 
ant poured the brandy and left 
while Doris studied him with a 
half-smile. 

“Perhaps you don’t find me at- 
tractive,” she said. 

“Very attractive,” he exploded. 
“You couldn’t be attractiver, er — ” 

She scooted up beside him. 
“Now look, Frank.” she said seri- 
ously. “This is non-compulsion and 
you’ve got to get through with it or 
those damn social engineers will 
drive you crazy.” 

Lansing nodded miserably, closed

his eyes and trembled. The rose- 
petal lips touched his. Then she 
moved her supple body tight to 
him and she trembled excitingly in 
a burning kiss. It seemed — er— 
burning. 

However, that was all. After the 
embarrassment of a couple of 
kisses she pulled away and they fell 
to talking about his investments on 
Venus. Enough was enough, and 
obviously society couldn’t cure one 
person’s habit pattern by destroy- 
ing the marriage-habit pattern of 
others. He realized this when he 
heard his shadows, the reporters, 
thumping around in the outer hall, 
still on guard, ready to prevent any 
real seduction. 

No wonder that other, quiet man 
had suddenly up and shot three 
redheads. His social engineer 
must’ve been a redhead, decided 
Lansing. 

He shook hands with Mrs. 
Woodring and left, feeling relieved 
and happy. At least he’d done 
enough to satisfy Watkins. It had 
been a strain but now they’d leave 
him alone. He arrived at his apart- 
ment with a sigh. 

The social engineering reporters 
were ahead of him, denying him 
entrance to his place. 

“Now wait a minute,” said Lan- 
sing. “I’ve gotten more or less 
drunk, robbed a bank and kissed a 
blonde. If that doesn’t take care 
of my hidden desires, nothing ever 
will, because each of these acts is a 
monumental disturbance for me, 
totally against the grain.” 

“No,” said one, “you haven’t 
really committed an act of passion 
yet. True, you’ve done all these 
things, but you haven’t felt them. 



Keep going — it may take several 
days.” 

“But where will I sleep tonight?” 

The reporter grinned. “Why not 
try a park bench?” 

Argument was futile. Lansing 
grimly plodded away. 

Sometime in the middle of the 
night he awoke with a sneeze. The 
park bench was hard. Besides, po- 
licemen kept waking him up to 
make him show his non-compul- 
sion license. He turned over and 
sneezed again. He was going to 
have a cold. And when he had a 
cold — 

Lansing contemplated the hor- 
ror of his situation staring at the 
solemn moon. A great resolve and 
purpose took shape inside of him, 
firmed up and became a burning 
certainty. 

D ED-EYED, disheveled and 
sneezing, he faced Watkins 
across the social engineer’s gleam- 
ing desk. His unshaven beard 
itched and he felt dirty and com- 
pletely miserable. 

“I want the key to my apartment 
back,” he said. 

Watkins shuffled some papers. 
“I’m afraid these reports show that 
you haven’t really cut loose yet, 
Lansing. You’re the same timid, 
apologetic, routinized person you’ve 
always been.” 

“I’m about to cut loose,” said 
Lansing. 

His temples were throbbing, his 
mouth was dry. He sneezed once, 
and then he climbed up and walked 
over the top of Watkins’ desk. He 
put his foot on Watkins’ chest and 
shoved, and the fat man went over 




66 



RAYMOND E. BANKS 



backwards in his swivel chair with a 
crash. A wild thrill of delight 
coursed through Lansing. 

“Help! He’s gone mad — ” cried 
Watkins. 

“Mad! Mad!” yelled Lansing in 
delight, jumping down and punch- 
ing the chubby figure. He hadn’t 
laid an angry hand on a fellow-man 
since his second year in high school. 
The first punches were uncertain 
but he got the knack with astound- 
ing quickness and let Watkins have 
it in the face and body. 

“Here’s your passion!” he roared 
slamming Watkins against the floor 
so the whole office shook. Watkins 
slumped on the soft rug in a bloody 
blubbering and suddenly Lansing 
felt the hate and excitement fade 
into a wonderful sense of content- 
ment. 

He stood over Watkins, feeling 
his bruised hands with satisfaction. 
The familiar reporters rushed into 
the room. One of them covered him 
with a gun while the other jumped 
to the phone and called, first a doc- 
tor, then the police, and then 
Hedges, the district social engineer. 

Hedges listened, frowning, to the 
story; and then Lansing laid his 
non-compulsion license on Watkins’ 
rumpled desk and said quietly: 

“Now can I have my apartment 
key back?” 

“You won’t need your apart- 
ment!” yelled Watkins, sitting up 
on the floor. “You’re going to jail 
for twenty years for this!” 



“Give him his key,” said Hedges. 
“Watkins, I’m afraid you can’t pre- 
fer charges. We social engineers 
have a higher duty — to help our pa- 
tients achieve adjustment. In this 
one case, the only passion Lansing 
could feel was against you. Since no 
permanent harm was done, he has 
acted within range of his non-com- 
pulsion license. Therefore, I pro- 
nounce him free.”

Fuze

C OMMANDER BENEDICT kept 
his eyes on the rear plate as he 
activated the intercom. “All right, 
cut the power. We ought to be safe 
enough here.” 

As he released the intercbm, Dr. 
Leicher, of the astronomical staff, 
stepped up to his side. “Perfectly 
safe,” he nodded, “although even 
at this distance a star going nova 
ought to be quite a display.” 
Benedict didn’t shift his gaze 
from the plate. “Do you have your 
instruments set up?” 

“Not quite. But we have plenty 
of time. The light won’t reach us 
for several hours yet. Remember, 
we were outracing it at ten lights.” 
The commander finally turned, 
slowly letting his breath out in a 
soft sigh. “Dr. Leicher, I would say 

67 



"oifSt SAf—

that this is just about the foulest 
coincidence that could happen to 
the first interstellar vessel ever to 
leave the Solar System.” 

Leicher shrugged. “In one way 
of thinking, yes. It is certainly true 
that we will never know, now, 
whether Alpha Centauri A ever had 
any planets. But, in another way, 
it is extremely fortunate that we 
should be so near a stellar explo- 
sion because of the wealth of scien- 
tific information we can obtain. As 
you say, it is a coincidence, and 
probably one that happens only 
once in a billion years. The chances 
of any particular star going nova 
are small. That we should be so 
close when it happens is of a van- 
ishingly small order of probability.” 
Commander Benedict took off his 
cap and looked at the damp stain 
in the sweatband. “Nevertheless, 
Doctor, it is damned unnerving to 
come out of ultradrive a couple of 
hundred million miles from the 
first star ever visited by man and 
have to turn tail and run because 
the damned thing practically blows 
up in your face.” 

Leicher could see that Benedict 
was upset; he rarely used the same 
profanity twice in one sentence. 

They had been downright lucky, 
at that. If Leicher hadn’t seen the 
star begin to swell and brighten, if 
he hadn’t known what it meant, or 
if Commander Benedict hadn’t 
been quick enough in shifting the 
ship back into ultradrive — Leicher 
had a vision of an incandescent 
cloud of gaseous metal that had 
once been a spaceship. 

The intercom buzzed. The com- 
mander answered, “Yes?” 

“Sir, would you tell Dr. Leicher 



RANDALL GARRETT 

that we have everything set up 
now?” 

Leicher nodded and turned to 
leave. “I guess we have nothing to 
do now but wait.” 

When the light from the nova 
did come. Commander Benedict 
was back at the plate again — the 
forward one, this time, since the 
ship had been turned around in or- 
der to align the astronomy lab in 
the nose with the star. 

Alpha Centauri A began to 
brighten and spread. It made Bene- 
dict think of a light bulb connected 
through a rheostat, with someone 
turning that rheostat, turning it un- 
til the circuit was well overloaded. 

The light began to hurt Bene- 
dict’s eyes even at that distance and 
he had to cut down the receptivity 
in order to watch. After a while, 
he turned away from the plate. Not 
because the show was over, but sim- 
ply because it had slowed to a point 
beyond which no change seemed to 
take place to the human eye. 

Five weeks later, much to Leirh- 
er’s chagrin, Commander Benedict 
announced that they had to leave 
the vicinity. The ship had only 
been provisioned to go to Alpha 
Centauri, scout the system without 
landing on any of the planets, and 
return. At ten lights, top speed for 
the ultradrive, it would take better 
than three months to get back. 

“I know you’d like to watch it 
go through the complete cycle,” 
Benedict said, “but we can’t go back 
home as a bunch of starved skele- 
tons.” 

Leicher resigned himself to the 
necessity of leaving much of his 
work unfinished, and, although he 
knew it was a case of sour grapes.

consoled himself with the thought 
that he could as least get most of 
the remaining information from the 
five-hundred-inch telescope on Lu- 
na, four years from then. 

As the ship slipped into the not- 
quite-space through which the ul- 
tradrive propelled it, Lcicher began 
to consolidate the material he had 
already gathered. 

C OMMANDER BENEDICT 
wrote in the log: 

Fifty-four days out from Sol. Al- 
pha Centauri has long since faded 
back into its pre-blowup state, since 
we have far outdistanced the light 
from its explosion. It now looks as 
it did two years ago. It — 

“Pardon me, Commander,” 
Leieher interrupted, “But I have 
something interesting to show you.” 
Benedict took his fingers off the 
keys and turned around in his chair. 
“What is it, Doctor?” 

Leieher frowned at the papers in 
his hands. “I’ve been doing some 
work on the probability of that ex- 
plosion happening just as it did, and 
I’ve come up with some rather 
frightening figures. As I said be- 
fore, the probability was small. A 
little calculation has given us some 
information which makes it even 
smaller. For instance: with a pos- 
sible error of plus or minus two 
seconds Alpha Centauri A began to 
explode the instant we came out of 
ultradrive! 

“Now, the probability of that oc- 
curring comes out so small that it 
should happen only once in ten to 
the four hundred sixty-seventh 
seconds.” 

It was Commander Benedict’s 



turn to frown. “So?” 

“Commander, the entire universe 
is only about ten to the seventeenth 
seconds old. But to give you an 
idea, let’s say that the chances of 
its happening are once in millions 
of trillions of years!” 

Benedict blinked. The number, 
he realized, was totally beyond his 
comprehension — or anyone else’s. 

“Well, so what? Now it has hap- 
pened that one time. That simply 
means that it will almost certainly 
never happen again!” 

“True. But, Commander, when 
you buck odds like that and win, 
the thing to do is look for some fac- 
tor that is cheating in your favor. 
If you took a pair of dice and start- 
ed throwing sevens, one right after 
another — for the next couple of 
thousand years — you’d begin to 
suspect they were loaded.” 

Benedict said nothing; he just 
waited expectantly. 

“There is only one thing that 
could have done it. Our ship.” 
Leieher said it quietly, without em- 
phasis. 

“What we know about the hyper- 
space, or superspace, or whatever 
it is we move through in ultradrive 
is almost nothing. Coming out of 
it so near to a star might set up 
some sort of shock wave in normal 
space which would completely dis- 
rupt that star’s internal balance, re- 
sulting in the liberation of unimag- 
inably vast amounts of energy, caus- 
ing that star to go nova. We can 
only assume that we ourselves were 
the fuze that set off that nova.” 
Benedict stood up slowly. When 
he spoke, his voice was a choking 
whisper. “You mean the sun — Sol 
— might. .”

RANDALL GARRETT 



L EICHER NODDED. “I don’t 
say that it definitely would. But 
the probability is that we were the 
cause of the destruction of Alpha 
Gentauri A, and therefore might 
cause the destruction of Sol in the 
same way.” 

Benedict’s voice was steady again. 
“That means that we can’t go back 
again, doesn’t it? Even if we’re not 
positive, we can’t take the chance.” 
“Not necessarily. We can get 
fairly close before we cut out the 
drive, and come in the rest of the 
way at sub-light speed. It’ll take 
longer, and we’ll have to go on half 
or one-third rations, but we can do 
it!” 

“How far away?” 

“I don’t know what the mini- 
mum distance is, but I do know how 
we can gage a distance. Remember, 
neither Alpha Centauri B or C 
were detonated. We’ll have to cut 
our drive at least as far away from 
Sol as they are from A.” 

“I see.” The commander was si- 
lent for a moment, then: “Very 
well, Dr. Leicher. If that’s the saf- 
est way, that’s the only way.” 
Benedict issued the orders, while 
Leicher figured the exact point at 
which they must cut out the drive, 
and how long the trip would take. 
The rations would have to be cut 
down accordingly. 

Commander Benedict’s mind 
whirled around the monstrousness 



of the whole thing like some dizzy 
bee around a flower. What if there 
had been planets around Gentauri 
A? What if they had been inhabit- 
ed? Had he, all unwittingly, killed 
entire races of living, intelligent be- 
ings? 

But, how could he have known? 
The drive had never been tested 
before. It couldn’t be tested inside 
the Solar System — it was too fast. 
He and his crew had been volun- 
teers, knowing that they might die 
when the drive went on. 

Suddenly, Benedict gasped and 
slammed his fist down on the desk 
before him. 

Leicher looked up. “What’s the 
matter, Commander?” 

“Suppose,” came the answer, 
“Just suppose, that we have the 
same effect on a star when we go 
into ultradrive as we do when we 
come out of it?” 

Leicher was silent for a moment, 
stunned by the possibility. There 
was nothing to say, anyway. They 
could only wait. 

A little more than half a light 
year from Sol, when the ship reach- 
ed the point where its occupants 
could sec the light that had left 
their home sun more than seven 
months before, they watched it be- 
come suddenly, horribly brighter. 
A hundred thousand times brighter!

It was, Kirk thought, like standing in a gully, watch-

fall at any minute, crushing your life out instantly be- 
neath its weight. Your only possible defenses are your 
brain and voice — but how do you argue with a boul-

’mid pleasures and palaces 

By James McKimmey, Jr. 

Illustrated by Philip Parsons 



HIS PLANET was remote and 
set apart, and nothing about 
it had made William Kirk think he 
might find human life. Yet just be- 
yond, through a thorny bush shaped 
like an exploding rose, Kirk had 
seen eyes and nose and a flash of 
yellow hair that were definitely hu- 
man. 

Kirk poised motionless. He was 
three miles from the rocket and 
Leo, who was waiting inside of it. 
He thought for a moment of how 
Leo had told him, as they made 
their landing, that this is the kind of 
planet where you could go no fur- 
ther. This is the kind of planet that 
could be the end of twelve years, 
and you’d better be careful, Wil- 
liam, old sport. 



Kirk noticed a faint breeze; his 
palms were wet, and they cooled 
when the breeze touched them. He 
placed his palms against his jacket. 
Damn you, Leo, he thought. Damn 
your rotten fortune-telling. Kirk 
was superstitious when he was in 
space, and the memory of Leo Ma- 
son’s cool, quiet voice saying 
“Watch it now, sport. Be careful, be 
careful . .” seemed now like some 
certain kiss of fate. 

The bush trembled and Kirk’s 
right hand flicked to his holster. His 
pistol was cold against his fingers 
and he let it fit loosely in his hand, 
the barrel half-raised. 

The bush shivered again, and 
then all at once the figure was rising 
from behind it, a tall wide figure 

71 





MID PLEASURES AND PALACES 



73 



with a very tan face, lined and 
toughened by the sun. The shoul- 
ders, bare like the chest, were mas- 
sive, yet somehow stretched-looking, 
as though endless exposure to wind 
and rain and sun had turned the 
skin to brown leather. 

Kirk had his pistol pointing at 
the figure’s stomach now, and the 
figure blinked, while the breeze 
touched and ruffled the long 
bleached hair. 

The figure raised a large hand, 
palm up, and curled the fingers. 
“Hello?” he said softly. Kirk was 
surprised by the word and the polite 
sound of it. 

Kirk remained motionless, pistol 
pointing. “Who are you?” he said 
through his teeth. 

“Harry,” said the figure, as 
though Kirk surely should know 
who he was. “I’m Harry, of course.” 

“Yes?” said Kirk carefully. 
“Harry?” 

The figure nodded. “Harry Lo- 
ren, don’t you know?” 

“Oh, yes,” Kirk said, his eyes 
watchful. “Harry Loren.” There 
was something about the man’s 
eyes, Kirk decided. They were deep 
set and very bright within their 
sockets. They didn’t match the soft- 
ness of the speech. Harry Loren 
smiled and showed his yellow teeth. 
“Who are you?” he asked politely. 

“I’m William,” Kirk said. It was 
as though he might be speaking to 
a frightened child, he thought, who 
help a sharp knife in his hands. 
“William Kirk, of course.” 

Harry Loren nodded apologetic- 
ally. “Oh, yes. I can’t remember 
everyone. It’s been so long. How are 
you, William?” 

Kirk’s eyes flickered. “I’m fine.” 



“That’s nice,” Harry Loren 
nodded. His wild hair brushed over 
his shoulders and reflected its yel- 
lowness against the sun. The knife 
then, the one that Kirk had thought 
about a moment ago, appeared in 
the figure’s hand. “Bastard,” Harry 
Loren hissed, and he was leaping at 
Kirk, the knife making a sweep to- 
ward Kirk’s stomach. 

Something kept Kirk from 
squeezing the trigger, and instead 
he swung his pistol so that it struck 
the brown, weathered knuckles. 
The knife flew into a thicket and 
Loren, screaming, was upon Kirk, 
reaching for Kirk’s neck. Kirk 
wrenched backward and at the 
same time swung the barrel of the 
pistol toward the yellow flying hair. 
There was a cracking sound, and 
Harry Loren, brown and wild-look- 
ing, crumpled silently before Kirk’s 
feet. 

Kirk examined the man, then he 
reached down and picked up the 
knife from the thicket. It was crude- 
ly hammered out from some kind of 
alloy, but sharp nevertheless, and 
it could have been deadly in a hand 
like Harry Loren’s. 

Kirk looked again at the yellow- 
haired man on the ground. He was 
wearing some kind of ragged cloth 
about his waist and nothing else. 
Across his back, Kirk could see, was 
a curving scar, an inch wide and 
ten or twelve inches long. It was 
white and very noticeable against 
the brown of the man’s skin. 

Kirk bent down, looking at the 
scar carefully. It could have been 
made during a crash of a rocket, 
but there were, he noticed, fine 
whiter ridges running along the 
length of the scar as though they 




74 

had been made by fine comb-Kke 
teeth. A talon, perhaps. Some kind 
of strange claw. Kirk straightened 
quickly. 

It went through his head that 
Harry Loren might not be the only 
animal life on this planet. He tight- 
ened his hand on his pistol, stepping 
backward, his eyes darting. 

But he could only pivot slowly, 
trying to see, to discover, and he 
was much too slow when he finally 
saw it. It was only a flash of yellow 
and brown, making a hissing kind 
of sound. He felt the ripping along 
his right arm. The pistol was going 
out of his hand. And a swirling 
blackness got in front of his eyes. 

HEN HE AWOKE he saw 
Harry Loren first, who was 
sitting up now, silent, motionless, 
with Kirk’s pistol resting in his 
hands. 

To the side of Loren and just a 
little behind rested a peculiar-look- 
ing thing. It was alive because its 
head, shaped like a cone that had 
been attached to its neck, kept 
swaying gently back and forth. Tbe 
dark blue eyes, spaced back from 
the smallest end of the cone, were 
rather small with no lids. The crea- 
ture’s neck was long and thin, a 
multitude of shades of yellow and 
brown like the head, and the rest 
of the body widened out like a fun- 
nel and this area was covered with 
yellow feathers. It had what ap- 
peared to be arms and legs, long 
thin extensions of dark brown with 
large bony joints. At the end of each 
of these, Kirk could see a flat claw 
with rows of tiny comb-like teeth. 

Loren reached out and ran a 



JAMES McKIMMEY, JR. 

hand softly along the creature’s long 
neck. 

Kirk tried to think, testing his 
muscles without moving, and he re- 
membered then the ripping along 
his right arm. He looked at the arm 
and at the way his jacket had been 
torn away along with the shirt be- 
neath it. He could see the comb-like 
marking of his skin. The cut was 
not deep but it bled a little and 
stung. He tried to move his arm and 
found that he could. 

Kirk looked back to Loren. Loren 
stroked his hand along the thin 
neck of the creature. Kirk decided 
to try: 

“That’s a nice looking animal, 
Harry.” 

Loren’s expression did not 
change. 

Kirk paused. From the looks of 
the man, Loren had been here a 
long time, a very long time. It had 
been a crash, probably. And all the 
years afterward of loneliness, all the 
time for the quiet but sure warping 
of the brain. 

He raised a hand quickly, watch- 
ing Loren’s eyes. Loren did not 
change expressions or move the pis- 
tol, but Kirk felt a comb-like claw 
touching his hand, freezing it to 
motionless with its razor tips. Kirk 
looked at the creature. The dark 
blue eyes were steady. Kirk lowered 
his hand slowly and the claw was 
drawn away. The creature’s head 
resumed it’s gentle swaying, and 
Loren’s hand resumed its stroking. 

Kirk licked his lips. 

“Where have you been?” Loren 
said, his voice sudden and hoarse 
now. 

“Where have I been?” Kirk said, 
tight and motionless. 





'MID PLEASURES AND PALACES 



75 



“Why didn’t you come before?” 
Kirk considered it. The dancing 
lights in the man’s eyes, the high- 
strung sound of his voice were 
things to make you wary and care- 
ful. Kirk closed his fingers the 
slightest bit. “I didn’t know you 
were here.” 

Loren’s lips thinned. “Liar.” 

Kirk thought he might try a 
smile, to reassure Loren that he 
was telling the truth. He decided 
against it. “How long have you been 
here, Harry?” 

“How would I know?” 

Kirk thought of the endless nights 
and days when time ran together 
and there was no more separation 
of one time from another. Today 
would be tomorrow and tomorrow 
would be today. No changes. End- 
less. “Did you crash, Harry?” 

“Did you crash, Harry?” Loren 
mimicked, and for a moment Kirk 
felt a chill dancing through him as 
he watched the sarcastic leer of 
Loren’s mouth. 

Kirk kept his tone polite, pa- 
tronizing. “Was there anyone else?” 
Loren laughed, a laugh that 
bounced over the rocks and through 
the scrubs and bushes. 

“Was there, Harry?” 

“Oh, yes,” Loren said, grinning 
and showing his yellow teeth. “Six. 
One, two, three, four, five, six. 
Would you like to see their graves? 
I’ve kept the graves pretty. I know 
where they are because I dug 
them.” 

Loren remained in a half crouch, 
the fingers of one hand holding the 
pistol loosely, the other keeping up 
its monotonous stroking of the ani- 
mal. His eyes seemed to become va- 
cant for a moment, as though lost 



in the memory of the digging of six 
graves. Then they narrowed. 
“Where have you been?” 

Kirk tried to match his answer 
to the wants of the man. “I came 
as soon as I could.” 

“You did?” 

“Yes,” Kirk said. “I did.” 

Loren’s right hand stopped its 
stroking and his fingers tightened 
about the thin long neck of the ani- 
mal. “Eddie?” he said. 

Kirk saw the animal’s left claw 
whipping out. He ducked suddenly, 
but the claw ripped along his left 
arm. He tried to roll sideways, and 
then he lay, half sprawled, looking 
at the blood welling up from this 
new set of ripped ridges in his arm. 
He shifted his eyes to look at the 
animal, and he was quite certain 
that he could detect a small mouth 
fitting around the under side of the 
funnel-shaped head. It was only a 
line, but Kirk thought that there 
was a grinning look to it. 

“You didn’t come as soon as you 
could,” Loren said, his voice an 
angry trembling sound. 

“I did, Harry,” Kirk said, still re- 
maining in his half sprawl. “I really 
did.” 

Loren replaced his hand on the 
neck of the animal, squeezing. 

“No, no,” Kirk said, and he tried 
to keep the panic out of his voice. 
“Harry, I’m telling you the truth!” 

L OREN’S MOUTH showed a 
faint surface of his yellow teeth. 
He shook his head, slowly, back and 
forth, his fingers tightening about 
the animal’s neck. 

“Harry, listen,” Kirk said, watch- 
ing Loren’s squeezing fingers, “it’s 




76 

over now. You don’t have to wait 
any longer. I’ll take you back now. 
I’ll take you home!” 

Loren froze, staring. “Home?” he 
said. 

“That’s right,” Kirk said. “That’s 
right, Harry.” 

"Home” Loren breathed, and 
his eyes were suddenly like a child’s, 
wide and unbelieving. 

“The waiting’s all over,” Kirk 
said. “You don’t have to wait any 
longer.” 

“I don’t have to wait any longer,” 
Loren repeated softly, and his hand 
dropped from the neck of the ani- 
mal. 

Kirk watched Loren and the 
swaying animal. “The rocket’s 
ready,” he said. 

Loren’s eyes were lost in some 
distant memory. Gradually Kirk 
could see the eyes turn shiny with 
tears. “Is Annette waiting?” he 
asked. 

Kirk thought quickly. He knew 
Ithat what he was going to say 
shouldn’t be said, because he had 
no right. But he was thinking of 
his own skin. “Why, yes, Harry,” he 
said slowly. “I imagine Annette is 
waiting.” 

Loren let a quick breath come 
through his teeth. “Annette,” he 
whispered. “And Dickie?” 

“Dickie?” Kirk said. 

“Little Dickie?” Loren said and 
he held his breath. 

“Oh, yes,” Kirk lied. “Of 
course.” 

“I can’t ask about Eddie, because 
we never had the chance,” Loren 
said, his eyes still lost. “I always 
told Annette that no kid should 
ever grow up without a brother, 
only we never had the chance for 



JAMES McKiMMEY, JR. 

Eddie.” Loren reached out absently 
and touched the brown and yellow 
neck of the creature. “I called this 
fellow Eddie, though. Do you sup- 
pose that was all right? He’s not 
very pretty.” 

Kirk nodded, looking at the wav- 
ing, funnel-shaped head of the ani- 
mal. “That was all right, Harry.” 

“Does she still braid her hair?” 
Loren asked, his eyes shiny. 

“What?” Kirk said. 

“Annette. Does she still braid her 
hair?” 

“Why,” Kirk said slowly, feeling 
his palms going moist. “Why 
wouldn’t she, Harry?” 

A faint smile flickered across 
Loren’s lips as he remembered. 

Kirk watched one of the crea- 
ture’s claws, out of the corners of 
his eyes. He opened and closed the 
fingers of one hand, testing. The 
claw jerked slightly. 

The blood of Kirk’s new wound 
was drying, he knew, because it had 
been only a surface cut. He. won- 
dered how it would be if the thing 
used its claws with serious intent. 
Like it must have to make the cut 
that had been raked into Loren’s 
back. Loren was bending forward 
now, and Kirk could see the tip end 
of that scar. Somehow Loren had 
managed to stay alive and befriend 
the creature. Eddie. The lidless eyes 
stared. 

Kirk knew that he had to make 
use of the moment. It could break 
apart any time, the wildness could 
return, the unreasoning . 

“Listen, Harry,” he said, “we 
ought to get started, you know. 
There’s no use waiting longer.” 

“Started?” Loren said. 

“Of course,” Kirk said, trying to 




"MID PLEASURES AND PALACES 



77 



keep his voice matter-of-fact. 
“You’re going home.” 

Loren looked at Kirk and his eyes 
turned suddenly hard and his 
mouth lost the faint smile. “I am,” 
he stated flatly. 

“Yes,” Kirk said. “Of course.” 
“You’re a liar.” 

“Now, Harry,” Kirk said, his eyes 
flickering to the waiting animal. “I 
surely wouldn’t lie to you.” 

“You haven’t come for me until 
after all this time, and now you say 
you surely wouldn’t lie to me.” 

It was like standing in a gully, 
Kirk thought, watching a boulder 
teetering above you. It tipped this 
way and that, and you didn’t know 
when or if it was going to come 
hurtling down. You waited. But 
Kirk couldn’t wait, he knew. He 
had to do something. 

“Harry, listen. It wasn’t easy to 
find you, don’t you see?” He hoped 
he was making it sound as though 
all he had done for the last dozen 
years of exploring was look for 
Harry Loren. He wished that the 
damned thing would stop swaying 
its ugly head back and forth. Lo- 
ren’s hand was inching out toward 
the yellow and brown neck. 

“Look, Harry, these things aren’t 
done in a day. We — ” 

“A day!” Loren hissed. “A day! 
All this time and you say a day!” 
“No, I’m sorry,” Kirk said quick- 
ly. He wished he could shift out 
of the cramped half-lying position 
he was in. “I didn’t mean a day, 
Harry. I meant it wasn’t easy. We 
didn’t know where you were — ” He 
was talking quickly, whining al- 
most, and he’d never whined before. 

Loren’s fingers were touching the 
waving neck. 



“We’d better hurry,” Kirk said 
desperately. “Annette’s waiting. 
And Dickie, of course.” 

Loren blinked. 

“You wouldn’t want to keep 
them waiting any longer, not after 
all this time, Harry.” 

Loren stroked his fingers slowly 
down the long neck of the animal. 

“I think,” Kirk said, almost 
hoarsely, “now that I really remem- 
ber it, Annette was still wearing her 
hair braided. I remember that now, 
Harry. Positively.” 

Loren froze the motion of his 
hand and stared at Kirk. His lips 
trembled, and then suddenly he put 
his hands in front of his face. He 
bent forward, and Kirk felt his 
nerves jumping, watching the man 
start to cry. 

The animal turned its stare away 
from Kirk for the first time. It 
looked at Loren and then slowly 
raised a claw, touching Loren’s 
shoulder carefully. It made a sound 
then, a peculiar hissing sound, soft, 
barely audible. There was no dan- 
ger in it, or menace, only a pitiful 
sound. 

Loren raised his head a little and 
brought his hands away from his 
face. Tears had cut through dust 
and grime and his face was 
streaked. 

“Shall we go, Harry?” Kirk said. 

Loren wiped at his eyes, stupidly, 
without knowing what he was do- 
ing. Then he brought his hands 
down and wiped them across his 
chest. 

“All right,” he said. “Let’s go.” 
He picked up Kirk’s pistol from 
where he had dropped it on the 
ground and held it out. 

Kirk looked at the gun and at the

animal. The claw had been drawn 
away from Loren’s shoulder and 
again it was poised, ready. “You 
keep it, Harry,” he said.” 

“Oh, yes. Of course,” Loren said. 
There was a moment of silence as 
Loren stuck the pistol absently into 
the waist of his ragged cloth cover- 
ing, beside the knife. The three of 
them waited then, Kirk, Loren, and 
the animal. 

“Eddie?” Loren said finally. “Are 
you ready?” 

IRK FELT himself smiling in 
the direction of the animal. He 
remembered when he was a small 
boy, going by a house where there 
had been a mongrel with a flat head 
and large teeth. He had smiled at 
that animal as he was doing now. 
The dog had sensed his fear in spite 
of the smile. 

Loren was standing up slowly, 
and the animal’s head swayed in 
slow circling motions. 

“All right?” Loren said. 

Kirk glanced at the man, saw the 
wild, nearly vacant look of the face, 
the polite tilt of the head. Kirk’s 
palms were wet. Goddamn it, he 
thought, and he stood up suddenly. 

The animal extended a claw, 
slowly, turning it so that it seemed 
to wind and circle as it came toward 
Kirk. 

“Eddie,” Loren said. 

The claw came away. Kirk 
caught his breath. 

“Shall we go?” Loren said, his 
eyes shining. 

“Yes,” Kirk said. “We’ll go, 
Harry.” He turned slowly, so that 
his back was to Loren and the ani- 
mal. He thought about the comb- 



like claws and the scar on Loren’s 
back. He thought about Loren’s 
knife and about the pistol. 

He wanted to look back as he 
walked. He wanted to talk, to hear 
Loren’s answer and so know just 
where he was. More than anything 
he wanted to break into a run and 
get into that rocket and get out of 
here. 

He could see the gleam of the 
rocket finally, but he didn’t look 
back yet. He kept moving. As he 
got closer he could see Leo, stand- 
ing near the base of the ship, tall, 
leaning carelessly against the silver 
surface, smoking. He wanted to 
shout to Leo, to tell him for God’s 
sake to wake up and protect him. 

They reached the edge of the 
clearing and Leo, whose careless 
body had stiffened, waited motion- 
less, one hand on his pistol. Kirk 
stopped. “There it is, Harry,” he 
said, not turning around. “There’s 
the ship.” He waited, half-closing 
his eyes, breathing slowly. 

There was no sound. 

“That’s Leo, my friend, Harr)’,” 
Kirk said, putting his palms flat 
against his thighs. “Your friend, 
Harry.” 

Leo, Kirk could see, was still 
frozen, his eyes slitted to narrow 
brightness. Kirk began to step into 
the clearing. “Hello, there, Leo,” he 
said, his voice a tense, grating 
sound. “I’ve brought some friends.” 

Leo was lifting his pistol out of 
its holster, inchingly. 

“Friends,” Kirk rasped. 

Leo’s thin eyes flickered and the 
pistol slid back into the holster. 

Kirk turned around slowly, and 
he saw that Loren had stopped just 
inside the clearing. The animal re- 





MID PLEASURES AND PALACES

mained beside him, its head making 
its slow circles. Loren was staring 
up at the rocket and the sun reflect- 
ing from the bright surface, came 
down and shown on Loren’s face, 
deepening the lines there. 

“Leo,” Kirk said slowly, “this is 
Harry Loren and his friend, Eddie. 
Harry’s been here quite a while, 
waiting for us.” 

“Oh, yes?” said Leo, still not 
moving. 

“That’s right, Leo,” Kirk said. 
“Quite awhile. What year was it, 
Harry?” he said across the clearing. 
“What year did you crash?” 

Loren blinked and there were 
tears again in his eyes. He reached 
out slowly, and the animal shifted 
so that its head touched Loren’s 
hand. “Twenty-four-nineteen.” 

Kirk put his teeth together. 
“Twenty-four-nineteen,” he said. 

Loren nodded slowly, his eyes 
still upon the rocket. 

“Eighteen years,” Leo said softly. 

“A long time, Leo,” Kirk said. 
He thought of a girl with her hair 
braided about her head, looking up, 
while Loren had shot into the 
depths of sky and space. He thought 
of a little boy called Dickie, stand- 
ing there, too, watching a fast dis- 
appearing blackness in the sky. He 
thought about eighteen years, and 
the fading of youth. A boy becom- 
ing a man. Braided hair becoming 
gray. Memories fading and minds 
adjusting. New love, new dedica- 
tion. A world shifting, a universe 
shifting. 

Kirk looked at Eddie, the animal, 
real and alive, waiting patiently at 
the tips of Loren’s fingers. “Eddie’s 



been with Harry for a long time,” 
he said. 

“Oh?” said Leo quietly. 

Loren’s hand stroked the brown 
and yellow head. 

“Harry,” Kirk said. “We’re going 
to leave now. Are you ready?” 

Loren was silent. 

“You go up first, will you, Leo?” 
Kirk said. 

Leo looked at him, a faint frown 
touching his brow, then he began 
moving up the ladder to the air 
lock. Kirk waited until Leo had dis- 
appeared into the rocket, then he 
repeated, “We’re going to leave 
now, Harry. Are you ready?” 

Loren remained motionless, his 
hand touching the animal’s head. 
Suddenly he turned then and began 
moving slowly away through the 
brush, the brown and yellow crea- 
ture bobbing beside him with queer 
rocker-like jumps. 

“Goodby, Harry,” Kirk said. 
Finally he turned and climbed up 
the ladder. When he had gotten 
into his seat, he said, “Let’s go, 
Leo,” and he moved his hands to 
the controls. 



The rocket settled into the quiet 
motion of its course through space. 

“But I don’t get it,” Leo said. “I 
really don’t. All that time, and then 
all he has to do is walk a dozen 
yards and get into the rocket and 
he’s going home. That’s all he 
would have to do.” 

“Why?” Kirk said. 

“Why?” said Leo, frowning. 

Kirk nodded, looking at the man. 
“Why?” 



• • • THE END 




Tabby was peculiar, of course, but seemed harmless: just a 
little green fly that couldn’t even protect itself from ordinary 
spiders. So the spiders fed, and grew, and fed, and grew . 



TABBY

April 18, 1956 

D EAR BEN: It breaks my 
heart you didn’t sign on for 
this trip. Your replacement, who 
calls himself an ichthyologist, has 
only one talent that pertains to fish 
— he drinks like one. There are 
nine of us in the expedition, and 
every one of us is fed up with this 
joker, Cleveland, already. We’ve 
only been on the island a week, and 
he’s gone native, complete with 
beard, bare feet and bone laziness. 
He slops around the lagoon like a 
beachcomber and hasn’t brought in 
a decent specimen yet. 

The island is a bit of paradise, 
though. Wouldn’t be hard to let 
yourself relax under the palms all 
day instead of collecting blisters 
and coral gashes out in the bright 
sun of the atoll. No complaints, 
however. We aren’t killing our- 
selves, and our little camp is very 
comfortable. The portable lab is 



working out fine, and the screened 
sleeping tenthouses have solved the 
one big nuisance we’ve suffered be- 
fore: Insects. I think an entomolo- 
gist would find more to keep him 
busy here than we will. 

Your ankle should be useable by 
the time our next supply plane 
from Hawaii takes off. If you apply 
again at the Foundation right now 
I’m sure Sellers and the others will 
help me get rid of Cleveland, and 
there’ll be an open berth here. 

Got to close now. Our amphib 
jets off in an hour for the return 
trip. Hope this note is properly se- 
ductive. Come to the isles, boy, and 
live! — Cordially, Fred 



May 26, 1956 

D EAR BEN: Now, aren’t you 
sorry you didn’t take my 
advice?!!!! I’m assuming you read 
the papers, and also, that too tight

a censorship hasn’t clamped down 
on this thing yet. Maybe I’m assum- 
ing too much on the latter. Any- 
how, here’s a detailed version from 
an actual eyewitness. 

That’s right! I was right there on 
the beach when the “saucer” 
landed. Only it looked more like a 
king-size pokerchip. About six feet 
across and eight inches thick with 
a little hemispherical dome dead 
center on top. It hit offshore about 
seventy-five yards with a splash 
that sounded like a whale’s tail. 
Jenner and I dropped our seine, 
waded to shore and started running 
along the beach to get opposite it. 
Cleveland came out of the shade 
and helped us launch a small boat. 

We got within twenty feet of the 
thing when it started moving out, 
slowly, just fast enough to keep 
ahead of us. I was in the bow look- 
ing right at it when the lid popped 
open with a sound like a cork com- 
ing out of a wine bottle. The little 
dome had split. Sellers quit rowing 
and we all hit the bottom of the 
boat. I peeked over the gunwale 
right away, and it’s a good thing. 
All that came out of the dome was 
a little cloud of flies, maybe a hun- 
dred or so, and the breeze picked 
them up and blew them over us in- 
shore so fast that Cleveland and 
Sellers never did see them. 

I yelled at them to look, but by 
then the flies were in mingling with 
the local varieties of sudden itch, 
and they figured I was seeing 
things. Cleveland, though, listened 
with the most interest. It develops 
that his specialty is entomology. He 
took this job because he was out of 
work. Don’t know how he bluffed 
his way past the Foundation, but 



here he is, and it looks like he might 
be useful after all. 

He was all for going ashore, but 
Sellers and I rowed after the white 
disk for awhile until it became ap- 
parent we couldn’t catch it. It’s a 
good thing we didn’t. A half hour 
later, Olafsen caught up to it in 
the power launch. We were watch- 
ing from shore. It was about a 
half mile out when Ole cut his 
speed. Luckily he was alone. We 
had yelled at him to pick us up 
and take us along, but he was too 
excited to stop. He passed us up, 
went out there and boom! 

It wasn’t exactly an A-bomb, but 
the spray hit us a half mile away, 
and the surface wave swamped us. 

Sellers radioed the whole inci- 
dent to Honolulu right away, and 
they are sending out a plane with 
a diver, but we don’t think he’ll find 
anything. Things really blew! So 
far we haven’t even found any 
identifiable driftwood from the 
launch, let alone Ole’s body or 
traces of the disk. 

Meanwhile, Cleveland has come 
to believe my story, and he’s out 
prowling around with art insect 
net. Most energy he’s shown in 
weeks. 



M AY 28 — Looks like this let- 
ter will be delayed a bit. We 
are under quarantine. The govern- 
ment plane came this morning. 
They sent along a diver, two re- 
porters and a navy officer. The 
diver went down right away, but 
it’s several hundred feet deep out 
there and slants off fast. This is- 
land is the tip of a sunken moun- 
tain, and the diver gave up after 




TABBY

less than an hour. Personally I 
think a couple of sharks scared him 
off, but he claims there’s so much 
vegetable ruck down there he 
couldn’t expect to find anything 
smaller than the launch’s motor. 

Cleveland hasn’t found anything 
unusual in his bug net, but every- 
one is excited here, and you can 
guess why. 

When the “saucer” reports 
stopped cold about a year ago, 
you’ll remember, it made almost as 
much news for a while as when 
they were first spotted. Now the 
people out here are speculating 
that maybe this disc thing came 
from the same source as the 
saucers, after they had a chance to 
look us over, study our ecology and 
return to their base. Cleveland is 
the one who started this trend of 
thought with his obsession that the 
flies I reported seeing are an attack 
on our planet from someone out in 
space. 

Commander Clawson, the navy 
officer, doesn’t know what to think. 
He won’t believe Cleveland until 
he produces a specimen of the “fly- 
from-Mars”, but then he turns 
around and contradicts himself by 
declaring a temporary quarantine 
until he gets further orders from 
Honolulu. 

The reporters are damned nuis- 
ances. They’re turning out reams 
of Sunday supplement type stuff 
and pestering the devil out of 
Sparks to let them wire it back, but 
our radio is now under navy con- 
trol, too. 

Sure is crowded in the bunk- 
house with the six additional peo- 
ple, but no one will sleep outside 
the screen. 



AY 29 — Cleveland thinks he 
has his specimen. He went 
out at dawn this morning and 
came in before breakfast. He’s quit 
drinking but he hasn’t slept in three 
days now and looks like hell. I 
thought he was getting his fancy 
imagination out of the bottle, but 
the soberer he got the more wor- 
ried he looked over this “invasion” 
idea of his. 

Now he claims that his catch is 
definitely a sample of something 
new under our particular sun. He 
hustled it under a glass and started 
classifying it. It filled the bill for 
the arthopods, class Insecta. It 
looked to me, in fact, just like a 
small, ordinary blowfly, except that 
it has green wings. And I mean 
green , not just a little iridescent 
color. 

Cleve very gently pulled one 
wing off and we looked at it under 
low power. There is more similarity 
to a leaf than to a wing. In the 
bug’s back is a tiny pocket, a sort 
of reservoir of the green stuff, and 
Cleve’s dissection shows tiny veins 
running up into the wings. It seems 
to be a closed system with no con- 
nection with the rest of the body 
except the restraining membrane. 

Cleveland now rests his extra- 
terrestrial origin theory on an idea 
that the green stuff is chlorophyll. 
If it is chlorophyll, either Cleve is 
right or else he’s discovered a new 
class of arthropods. In other re- 
spects the critter is an ordinary bit- 
ing and sucking bug with the po- 
tentials of about a deerfly for mak- 
ing life miserable. The high-power 
lens showed no sign of unusual or 
malignant microscopic life inside 
or out of the thing. Cleve can’t say 





84 



WINSTON MARKS 



how bad a bite would be, because 
he doesn’t have his entomologist 
kit with him, and he can’t analyze 
the secretion from the poison gland. 

The commander has let him 
radio for a botanist and some 
micro-analysis equipment. 

Everyone was so pitched up that 
Cleve’s findings have been rather 
anti-climactic. I guess we were giv- 
ing more credence to the space-in- 
vader theory than we thought. But 
even if Cleve has proved it, this fly 
doesn’t look like much to be fright- 
ened over. The reporters are clam- 
oring to be let loose, but the quar- 
antine still holds. 



J UNE 1 — By the time the plane 
with the botanist arrived we 
were able to gather all the speci- 
mens of Tabanidae viridis (Cleve- 
land’s designation) that he wanted. 
Seems like every tenth flying crea- 
ture you meet is a green “Tabby” 
now. 

The botanist helped Cleve and 
me set up the bio kit, and he con- 
firmed Cleve’s guess. The green 
stuff is chlorophyll. Which makes 
Tabby quite a bug. 

Kyser, the youngest reporter, vol- 
unteered to let a Tabby bite him. It 
did without too much coaxing. 
Now he has a little, itchy bump on 
his wrist, and he’s happily banging 
away at his typewriter on a story 
titled, “I Was Bitten by the Bug 
from Space!” That was hours ago, 
and we haven’t learned anything 
sinister about the green fly except 
that it does have a remarkable 
breeding ability. 

One thing the reporter accom- 
plished : we can go outside the 



screened quarters now without 
wondering about catching space-'' 
typhus. 

J UNE 2 — The quarantine was 
probably a pretty good idea. 
Cleve has turned up some dope on 
Tabby’s life cycle that makes us 
glad all over that we are sur- 
rounded by a thousand miles of 
salt water. Tabby’s adult life is only 
a couple of days, but she is vivipa- 
rous, prolific (some thousand 
young at a sitting), and her green 
little microscopic babies combine 
the best survival features of spores 
and plankton, minus one : they 
don’t live in salt water. But they 
do very well almost anyplace else. 
We have watched them grow on 
hot rocks, leaves, in the sand and 
best of all, filtered down a little 
into the moist earth. 

They grow incredibly fast with a 
little sun, so the chlorophyll is bio- 
logically justified in the life-cycle. 
This puzzled us at first, because 
the adult Tabby turns into a blood- 
sucking little brute. Deprived of 
any organic matter, our bottled 
specimens die in a short time, in or 
out of the sunlight, indicating the 
green stuff doesn’t provide them 
with much if any nourishment after 
they are full-grown. 

Now we are waiting for a supply 
of assorted insecticides to find the 
best controls over the pests. The 
few things we had on hand worked 
quite well, but I guess they aren’t 
forgetting our sad experience with 
DDT a few years back. 

The Tabbies now outnumber all 
the other insects here, and most 
outside work has been halted. The 




TABBY 



85 



little green devils make life miser- 
able outside the tent-houses. We 
have built another screened shelter 
to accommodate the latest arrivals. 
We are getting quite a fleet of am- 
phibian aircraft floating around our 
lagoon. No one will be allowed to 
return until we come up with all 
the answers to the question of con- 
trolling our insect invasion. 

Cleveland is trying to convince 
Sellers and the commander that 
we should get out and send in 
atomic fire to blow the whole is- 
land into the sea. They forwarded 
his suggestion to the U. N. com- 
mittee which now has jurisdiction, 
but they wired back that if the in- 
sect is from space, we couldn’t stop 
other discs from landing on the 
mainlands. Our orders are to study 
the bug and learn all we can. 

Opinion is mixed here. I can’t 
explain the flying disc unless it’s ex- 
traterrestrial, but why would an 
invader choose an isolated spot like 
this to attack? Cleve says this is 
just a “test patch” and probably 
under surveillance. But why such 
an innocuous little fly if they mean 
business? 

The newsmen are really bored 
now. They see no doom in the 
bugs, and since they can’t file their 
stories they take a dim view of the 
quarantine. They have gotten up 
an evening fishing derby with the 
crew members of the planes. Have 
to fish after dusk. The Tabbies bite 
too often as long as the sun is up. 

Cleve has turned into a different 
man. He is soft-spoken and intense. 
His hands tremble so much that he 
is conducting most of his work by 
verbal directions with the botanist 
and me to carry them out. When 



his suggestion about blowing up the 
atoll was turned down he quit talk-' 
ing except to conduct his work. If 
things were half as ominous as he 
makes out we’d be pretty worried. 

J UNE 4 — The spray planes got 
here and none too soon. We 
were running out of drinking water. 
The Tabbies got so thick that even 
at night a man would get stung in- 
sane if he went outside the screen. 

The various sprays all worked 
well. This evening the air is rela- 
tively clear. Incidentally, the birds 
have been having a feast. Now the 
gulls are congregating to help us 
out like they did the Mormons in 
the cricket plague. The spiders are 
doing all right for themselves, too. 
In fact, now that we have sprayed] 
the place the spiders and their con- 
founded webs are the biggest nui- 
sance we have to contend with. 
They are getting fat and sassy. Spin 
their webs between your legs if you 
stand still a minute too long. Re- 
mind me of real estate speculators 
in a land boom, the little bastardly 
opportunists. As you might gather, 

I don’t care for brothers Arachni- 
dae. They make everyone else nerv- 
ous, too. Strangely, Cleveland, the 
entomologist, gets the worst jolt out 
of them. He’ll stand for minutes at 
the screen watching them spin their 
nasty webs and skipping out to de- 
juice a stray Tabby that the spray 
missed. And he’ll mutter to him- 
self and scowl and curse them. It 
is hard to include them as God’s 
creatures. 

Cleve still isn’t giving out with" 
the opinions. He works incessantly 
and has filled two notebooks full of 




86 



WINSTON MARKS 



data. Looks to me like our work is 
almost done. 



UGUST 7, Year of our Lord 
1956 — To whom it will never 
concern: I can no longer make 
believe this is addressed to my 
friend, Ben Tobin. Cleveland has 
convinced me of the implications of 
our tragedy here. But somehow it 
gives me some crazy, necessary ray 
of hope to keep this journal until 
the end. 

I think the real horror of this 
thing started to penetrate to me 
about June 6. Our big spray job 
lasted less than 24 hours, and on 
that morning I was watching for 
the planes to come in for a second 
try at it when I noticed the heavy 
spider webbing in the upper tree 
foliage. As I looked a gull dove 
through the trees, mouth open, eat- 
ing Tabbies. Damned if the webs 
didn’t foul his wings. At first he 
tore at them bravely and it looked 
like he was trying to swim in thin 
mud — sort of slow motion. Then 
he headed into a thick patch, 
slewed around at right angles and 
did a complete flip. Instantly three 
mammoth spiders the size of my fist 
pounced out on him and trussed 
him up before he could tear loose 
with his feet. 

His pitiful squawking was what 
made me feel that horror for the 
first time. And the scene was re- 
peated more and more often. The 
planes dusted us with everything 
they had, and it cut down the Tab- 
bies pretty well again, but it didn’t 
touch the spiders, of course. 

And then our return radio mes- 
sages started getting very vague. 



We were transmitting Cleve’s data 
hourly as he compiled it, and we 
had been getting ordinary chatter 
and speculation from the Honolulu 
operator at the end of our mes- 
sage. That stopped on the sixth of 
June. Since then, we’ve had only 
curt acknowledgements of our data 
and sign-offs. 

At the same time, we noticed 
that complete censorship on news 
of our situation and progress ap- 
parently hit all the long-wave radio 
broadcasts. Up to that time the 
newscasts had been feeding out a 
dilute and very cautious pablum 
about our fight against Tabby. Im- 
mediately when we noticed this 
news blind spot Cleve went all to 
pieces and started drinking again. 

Cleve, Sellers and I had the lab 
tent to ourselves, having moved our 
bunks in there, so we got a little out 
of touch with the others. It wasn’t 
the way Sellers and I liked it, but 
none of us liked the trip from lab 
to living quarters any more, al- 
though it was only fifty feet or so. 

Then Sparks moved in, too. For 
the same reason. He said it was get- 
ting on his nerves running back 
and forth to the lab to pick up our 
outgoing bulletins. So he shifted the 
generator, radio gear and all over 
to a corner of the lab and brought 
in his bunk. 

By the tenth of June we could see 
that the spraying was a losing bat- 
tle. And it finally took the big trag- 
edy to drive home the truth that 
was all about us already. When 
the crew got ready to go out to 
their planes on the eleventh, every- 
one except the four of us in the 
lab tent was drafted to help clear 
webs between the tents and the 





TABBY 



87 



beach. We could hear them shout- 
ing from tent to tent as they made 
up their work party. We could no 
longer see across the distance. 
Everywhere outside, vision was ob- 
scured by the grayish film of webs 
on which little droplets caught the 
tropical sun like a million tiny mir- 
rors. In the shade it was like trying 
to peer through thin milk, with the 
vicious, leggy little shadows skit- 
tering about restlessly. 

As usual in the morning, the 
hum of the Tabbies had risen above 
the normal jungle buzzing, and this 
morning it was the loudest we’d 
heard it. 

Well, we heard the first screen 
door squeak open, and someone 
let out a whoop as the group 
moved out with brooms, palm 
fronds and sticks to snatch a path 
through the nightmare of spider 
webs. The other two doors opened 
and slammed, and we could hear 
many sounds of deep disgust voiced 
amid the grunts and thrashings. 

They must have been almost to 
the beach when the first scream 
reached us. Cleve had been listen- 
ing in fascination, and the awful 
sound tore him loose of his senses. 
He screamed back. The rest of us 
had to sit on him to quiet him. 
Then the others outside all began 
screaming — not words, just shat- 
tering screams of pure terror, 
mixed with roars of pain and anger. 
Soon there was no more anger. 
Just horror. And in a few minutes 
they died away. 

S ELLERS and Sparks and I 
looked at each other. Cleve had 
vomited and passed out. Sparks 



got out Cleve’ s whiskey, and we 
spilled half of it trying to get drinks 
into us. 

Sparks snapped out of it first. He 
didn’t try to talk to us. He just 
went to his gear, turned on the gen- 
erator and warmed up the radio. 
He told Honolulu what had hap- 
pened as we had heard it. 

When he finished, he keyed over 
for an acknowledgment. The oper- 
ator said to hold on for a minute. 
Then he said they would try to dis- 
patch an air task force to get us 
off, but they couldn’t be sure just 
when. 

While this was coming in Cleve 
came to his senses and listened. He 
was deadly calm now, and when 
Honolulu finished he grabbed the 
mike from Sparks, cut in the TX 
and asked, “Are they landing discs 
on the mainlands?” 

The operator answered, “Sorry, 
that’s classified.” 

“For God’s sake,” Cleve de- 
manded, “if you are ready to write 
us off you can at least answer our 
questions. Are there any of the 
green sonsofbitches on the main- 
land?” 

There was another little pause, 
and then, “Yes.” 

That was all. Sparks ran down 
the batteries trying to raise them 
again for more answers, but no re- 
sponse. When the batteries went 
dead he checked the generator that 
had kicked off. It was out of gaso- 
line. The drums were on the 
beach. Now we were without lights, 
power and juice for our other 
radios. 

We kept alive the first few days 
by staying half drunk. Then Cleve’s 
case of whiskey gave out and we be-

gan to get hungry. Sparks and 
Sellers set fire to one of our straw- 
ticking mattresses and used it as a 
torch to burn their way over to 
the supply tent about thirty feet 
away. It worked fairly well. The 
silky webs flashed into nothing as 
the flames hit them, but they 
wouldn’t support the fire, and other 
webs streamed down behind the 
two. They had to burn another 
mattress to get back with a few 
cases of food. 

Then we dug a well under the 
floor of our tent. Hit water within 
a few feet. But when we cut 
through the screen floor it cost us 
sentry duty. We had to have one 
person awake all night long to 
stamp on the spiders that slipped in 
around the edge of the well. 

Through all of this Cleveland 
has been out on his feet. He has 
just stood and stared out through 
the screen all day. We had to force 
him to eat. He didn’t snap out of 
it until this morning. 

Sparks couldn’t stand our radio 
silence any longer, so he talked 
Sellers into helping him make a 
dash for the gas drums on the 
beach. They set fire to two mat- 
tresses and disappeared into the 
tunnel of burned webs that tangled 
and caved in behind them. 

When they were gone, Cleve- 
land suddenly came out of his 
trance and put a hand on my 
shoulder. I thought for a moment 
he was going to jump me, but his 
eyes were calm. He said, “Well, 
Fred, are you convinced now that 
we’ve been attacked?” 

I said, “It makes no sense to me 
at all. Why these little flies?” 

Cleve said, “They couldn’t have 



done better so easily. They studied 
our ecology well. They saw that our 
greatest potential enemy was the 
insect population, and the most 
vicious part of it was the spider. 
Tabanidae viridis was not sent just 
to plague us with horsefly bites. 
Tabby was sent to multiply and 
feed the arachnids. There are dur- 
able species in all climates. And if 
our botanist were still alive he 
could explain in detail how long 
our plant life can last under this 
spider infestation. 

“Look for yourself,” he said 
pointing outside. “Not only are the 
regular pollenizing insects doomed, 
but the density of those webs will 
choke out even wind pollinated 
grains.” 

He stared down our shallow well 
hole and stamped on a small, black, 
flat spider that had slithered under 
the screening. “I suppose you real- 
ize the spiders got the others. 
Down here in the tropics the big 
varieties could do it by working to- 
gether. Sellers and Sparks won’t re- 
turn. Sounds like they got through 
all right, but they’ll be bitten so 
badly they won’t try to get back.” 

And even as he spoke we heard 
one of the aircraft engines start up. 
The sound was muffled as under a 
bed quilt. 

Cleve said, “I don’t blame them. 
I’d rather die in the sun, too. The 
beach should be fairly clear of 
webs. We’ve got one mattress left. 
What do you say?” 

He’s standing there now holding 
the mattress with the ticking stick- 
ing out. I don’t think one torch will 
get us through. But it will be worth 
a try for one more look at the sun.

I ’LL TAKE BEER, son, and 
thanks again for the offer. As you 
can see, I’m kinda down on my 
luck. I know what you’re thinking, 
but I’m not really on the bum. I 
usually make out all right — nothing 
fancy, mind you, but it’s a living. 
Odd jobs in the winter and spring, 
follow the harvests in the summer 
and fall. Things are slack right now. 

You? Electronics, huh? Used to 
know a fellow in electronics . 

His name was Joe Shannon, used 
to work for Stellar Electric up in 
Fremont. Young fellow, not more’n 
twenty-five or so. Rail thin, wispy 
hair, serious look — you know, the 
one suit, absent-minded type. Joe 
was a brain. A triple-A, gold-plated, 
genuine genius. Had a wife named 



Marge. Not beautiful but pretty 
and a nice figure and a cook you 
never saw the likes of. Like I say, 
she was married to Joe but Joe was 
married to his work and after you’d 
been around a while, you could tell 
there was friction. 

But that ain’t the beginning. 

I suppose I’m partly responsible 
because it started when I was over 
for dinner one night. I had been 
working in the garden and doing 
odd jobs around the house that 
afternoon and I finagled it so I was 
invited for supper. Marge Shannon 
made chili that I just couldn’t stay 
away from. Thick with beans and 
meat and easy on the spices so it 
wouldn’t burn an old man’s stom- 
ach.

Joe and I had just gone into the 
living room — Marge stayed in the 
kitchen to do the dishes — and I was 
feeling stuffed and kinda sleepy. All 
of a sudden Joe says out of a clear 
blue sky: “Harry, this is a hell of a 
world we live in, isn’t it?” 

Now Joe had never struck me as 
being the unhappy type. He loved 
his work, he loved his wife (and 
just about in that order), and so far 
as I knew he didn’t owe any money. 
So I tried to feel him out, to find 
out where the rub was. 

“There’s nothing wrong with the 
world, Joe,” I says. “It’s just the 
people in it.” 

He started methodically filling 
his pipe and tamping down the to- 
bacco and not saying a word and I 
get the feeling that he’s deadly 
serious about something. 

“You’re right,” he says quietly. 
“It isn’t the world, it’s the people.” 
I sit there feeling puzzled but a 
lot less sleepy and finally I ask: 
“Anything wrong, Joe?” 

He lights his pipe and settles back 
in the big, overstuffed easy chair 
with the flowered slip-cover that 
Marge made, still frowning. “It’s 
an unhappy world,” he repeats. 

“It all depends on what side of 
the picture you want to look at,” I 
says, trying to cheer him up. “May- 
be you been reading too many news- 
paper headlines.” 

Joe wasn’t listening. “What 
makes people unhappy, Harry?” 
Now, son, there’s a million things 
that make people unhappy. Given 
half the night, I could maybe list a 
couple of hundred. But to narrow 
it down to one or two, I couldn’t do 
it. So I just shook my head and let 
Joe carry the ball. 



“It’s a complex world, Harry. A 
lot of people never adjust to it. 
Some of them turn the tables and 
try to adjust the world to them, 
which makes a lot of other people 
unhappy. No, I’d say there’s a cer- 
tain number of people who just 
don’t fit in this world of ours. May- 
be at a different time and on an- 
other world, they might fit. But 
they don’t fit on this one, not right 
here and now.” 



T HAT WAS a way of looking at 
it that I had never thought of 
before. And Joe had a point. Now 
you take old Barney Muhlenberg, 
the town drunk. I knew Barney 
when he was a boy, and a more 
sober, adventure-seeking young ras- 
cal you never saw. But by then all 
the frontiers had dried up, it was 
between wars, and the only adven- 
ture Barney could find was in the 
bottom of a bottle. Barney was one 
of those poor folks born fifty years 
too late. 

Or you take Miss Alice Markey, 
the history teacher at Fremont 
High. She’s an old spinster — frail, 
white-haired, and a little bit crabby 
now. You’d never believe it but she 
used to be the romantic type. Some- 
how, the right man just never came 
along, but she’s never given up hop- 
ing either. 

Sure, you wouldn’t believe it to 
look at them. But that’s how people 
are, down underneath. All dreams 
and wishful thinking. 

“It’s tough, Joe,” I says, “but 
what can you do about it?” 

It always seemed to me that 
you weren’t going to help people by 
letting them fall asleep on a couch

at fifty dollars a nap and trying to 
convince them they should give up 
their dreams. 

“You’ve got to give people some- 
thing positive !” Joe says, hitting an 
end table with his fist so an ash- 
tray jumps off. 

I sat up and began to take notice. 
Once Joe had an idea, he usually 
did something about it. 

“You got something in mind,” I 
accused. 

He stopped pacing and pointed 
his pipe at me like it was the work- 
ing end of a twenty-two rifle. “I got 
an idea, Harry,” he says, the genius 
showing in his eyes like the dollar 
signs in a cash register. “I’m going 
to make a machine during my vaca- 
tion and . .” 

And then Marge is in the door- 
way, dishtowel in her hand and 
little anger spots in her cheeks. 
“Joseph Shannon!” she says, stamp- 
ing her foot. “You know perfectly 
well what we’re going to do and 
where we’re going to go on your 
vacation!” 

Joe’s mouth got set and I could 
see a storm blowing up so I strug- 
gled to my feet and got my hat. 
“That was awful nice chili, Missus 
Shannon,” I says, and it isn’t much 
more than two seconds later when 
I’m out the front door and walking 
up the sidewalk. 



W ELL, Joe — stubborn Irish- 
man that he was — stayed 
right in town during his vacation. 
He had a laboratory in the base- 
ment and every day when I went by 
I could hear him and Wally Claus, 
his assistant, working down there, 
hammering and nailing and run- 



ning electric motors that spat sparks 
and whined worse’n two alley cats 
fightin’ in a fish market. 

On the day that it’s finished, Joe 
invites me over for dinner again. 
After the meal’s over — and Joe’s so 
anxious that he don’t even tell 
Marge how nice the tuna fish cas- 
serole was — we go down into the 
basement. Marge doesn’t come 
along. 

“What’s the matter with 
Marge?” I ask. “Ain’t she in- 
terested?” 

Joe jams his hands in his pockets, 
scowls, and says: “We’ve been hav- 
ing a little trouble, Harry. She 
doesn’t see things my way.” 

It isn’t any of my business so I 
clam up and walk over to where 
the whole front half of the base- 
ment is curtained off with a couple 
of old sheets and a drawstring. 

“This is it,” Joe says proudly, 
pulling on the drawstring. “The 
greatest invention since the wheel !” 

Well, to tell you the truth, son, I 
was kinda disappointed. I had ex- 
pected something big and shiny but 
what there was looked a little like a 
cross between a phone booth and 
one of those things in train stations 
where you take your own photo- 
graph. I looked inside and all I 
could see was a big screen in front, 
like on a television set, a coin slot, 
and a funny looking hat with a 
cable leading out of it. 

“It’s real nice,” I says, not actual- 
ly knowing whether it was or not. 
“What is it?” 

“I call it a Paradise booth,” Joe 
says. 

I took another look at the ma- 
chine, and then looked at Joe. It 
occurs to me that maybe he’s been 




THE WORLDS OF JOE SHANNON

working too hard or that arguments 
with Marge have sorta unsettled 
him. 

“Look, Harry,” Joe says, “re- 
member when we were talking 
about all the people who didn’t fit 
in this world?” 

“Sure I remember,” I says. 
“What’s this got to do with it?” 

“What if people could choose 
the type of world they wanted to 
live in?” 

I looks at him blankly. “I don’t 
get it.” 

He fishes around for his pipe and 
lights up. “How big’s the universe, 
Harry?” 

“Now, son, I got no idea how big 
the universe is and I says so. All I 
know is that it’s big. 

“Most scientists say the universe 
is infinite,” Joe explains. “And if it’s 
infinite, then it must have an in- 
finite number of worlds in it. An 
actual world to match whatever 
kind of world you can dream up, 
let’s say. All you have to do is step 
into the Paradise booth, put on the 
cap, visualize the kind of world you 
want to live in so it shows on the 
screen, and off you go!” 

“You’re kidding,” I says feebly. 
“You don’t really mean it.” 

He taps me on the chest with his 
finger and says: “Yes, I do really 
mean it, Harry. I’ve tried it and it 
works!” 

And there I thought I had him. 
“If you went off to another world,” 
I says slyly, “just how did you get 
back?” 

“Built myself another machine,” 
he says promptly. 

I snapped the trap shut. “Just 
picked this world out of all the mil- 
lions there are? Just like that.” 



Joe grinned. “I just thought of 
the damndest world that I could, 
and here I was!” 

Well, he had me. There wasn’t 
much more I could say. Joe’s idea, 
of course, was to build machines 
and put them on the street corners 
like you would newspaper stands. 
He figured that all the misfits and 
the unhappy people would sneak 
out and use them and whisht, off 
they’d fly to their own favorite 
world, leaving all us well-adjusted 
people behind. He even had a slo- 
gan figured out. “Paradise — for 
only a quarter!’ 1 

You see, he figured he’d have to 
charge a quarter not only to pay 
for the machines but because peo- 
ple are just naturally suspicious of 
anything they get for free . 

J OE AND Wally Claus rigged 
up three of the machines and 
installed them on some of the better 
known street corners around Fre- 
mont. Joe had trouble getting a li- 
cense to do it, but when he told the 
city fathers what the machines did, 
they figured the best way to dis- 
courage a crackpot was to let him 
go ahead and flop on his own. 

And he came close to doing it. 
Those booths just sat on the street 
corners all summer and gathered 
dust. People called them Shannon’s 
folly, which didn’t help things with 
Marge any. 

And then one day, Barney Muhl- 
enberg disappeared. We thought 
he might have gotten drunk and 
fallen in the river and we spent a 
good two days dragging it. And 
then we looked in at his rooming 
house but we didn’t find a thing ex-

cept thirty-nine empty bottles and a 
rusty opener. 

It was Joe who first discovered 
what had happened. He got hold of 
me and we went down to the Para- 
dise booth on the corner just oppo- 
site from Schultz’s Bar and Grill. 
There was a quarter in the coin till 
and when I looked at the screen, 
I knew Barney had taken off. 

Well, everybody’s happy. Joe’s 
glad that his machine has finally 
caught on, Barney is probably hap- 
py playing Cowboys and Indians 
even though he’s way too old for it, 
and the town is happy because its 
worst sanitary problem has just 
eliminated itself. 

The news gets spread around and 
everybody starts laying odds on 
who’s gonna be the next to go. No- 
body goes near the booths for about 
a week, and then the kids start pass- 
ing around a rumor Saturday morn- 
ing that Miss Alice Markey has sub- 
mitted her resignation to the school 
board and is packing to leave town. 

The town splits. Half the people 
figure she’ll be sensible and leave by 
bus. The other half, myself in- 
cluded, station ourselves at the 
Paradise booth that’s nearest to her 
apartment. Along about noon, Miss 
Alice shows up. She’s pale and de- 
termined looking, all dressed up to 
travel. Her suitcase is leaking little 
bits and ends of clothing and over 
her shoulder she’s got a knapsack 
with her lunch in it. Always prac- 
tical, Miss Alice was. 

“You aren’t really thinking of 
leaving are you, Ma’m?” I ask, 
thinking it would be a shame for a 
good-hearted, hard-working school 
teacher like Miss Alice to leave Fre- 
mont. 



“I’ll thank you to mind your own 
business, young man!” she says 
coldly, and marches into the booth 
and pulls the curtain shut. A mo- 
ment later I hear a coin drop, 
there’s a flash of bright blue light, 
and then dead silence. 

I was the nearest one so I lifts the 
curtain and peeks in. Miss Alice 
and her suitcase and knapsack have 
disappeared. I look at the screen 
even though nobody needs to tell 
me that Miss Alice Markey has 
whisked ofF to a world where all 
the men look like Rudolph Valen- 
tino and have a fondness for old- 
maid school teachers. Sure enough, 
I was right . 

About mid-August, Joe comes 
around and he’s looking mighty 
worried. “Harry,” he says, “Wally 
Claus has disappeared.” 

I mull it over for a minute. “It 
can’t be what you’re thinking,” I 
says. “Wally’s one of the most nor- 
mal men in town.” 

We go down to see Wally’s wife 
and I begin to get the picture. 
Wally was one of those hard work- 
ing, hard drinking Dutchmen with 
a family about three times as big as 
his salary. He worked at Stellar 
Electric with Joe and, like I say. 
sometimes he used to help Joe in his 
lab. 

“When was the last time you saw 
Wally?” Joe asks gently. 

Mrs. Wally is blubbering in her 
handkerchief and trying to hold a 
kid on her lap at the same time. 
Two more are hanging onto her 
chair, and about six others are 
standing around the room sucking 
their thumbs and looking wide-eyed 
at Joe and me. 

“It was p-payday,” she blurts, the 




THE WORLDS OF JOE SHANNON 



95 



tears streaming down her fat cheeks. 
“Wally c-comes home drunk and 
all I do was quietly ask him for his 
paycheck. And that’s the last I see 
of him. I d-don’t know w-what got 
into him!” 

Anybody with half an eye, I 
thought, could piece together what 
had happened. Wally probably had 
one or two at Schultz’s bar and got 
to feeling sorry for himself and then 
when he got home, he walked into 
a hornet’s nest. Nine kids bawling 
or running around and Mrs. Wally 
nagging the life out of him. He 
must have wondered if it was worth 
it, then found a quarter in his 
pocket and walked around the cor- 
ner to the nearest Paradise booth. 
Whisht — and Wally’s worries are a 
thing of the past. 

Joe and I get the idea at the 
same time and we chase down to 
the nearest booth. I took one look 
at the screen and blushed. Wally 
had some pretty wild ideas. 

On the way home, I tried to talk 
Joe into tearing the machines down. 
“How do you know where it’s going 
to end, Joe?” I argues. “You can’t 
tell who’s well-adjusted and who 
isn’t any more. And besides, some 
of those who ain’t have contributed 
just as much to life as those who 
are. Maybe even more.” 

“I’m going to leave them up,” 
Joe says grimly. “The world will be 
better off without a lot of neurotics 
running around.” 

“You won’t think it over, Joe?” 
“No,” he says, “and to prove it, 
I’m going to spend the next two 
weeks in New York looking for 
backing to put up Paradise booths 
all across the country.” 

“What does Marge think?” I ask. 



“Hang Marge!” he says. 

Well, I just stood there in the 
middle of the block and watched 
him get smaller and smaller in the 
distance. I couldn’t think of any- 
thing more to say and he wouldn’t 
have listened to me anyways. 

I packed and left town that same 
night. The strawberry season was 
just coming on and I ain’t never 
missed a harvest yet. 

A bout two weeks passed 

and I couldn’t stay away any 
longer. I got back to town, took a 
look around, and then went down 
to the station to wait for Joe to 
come in on the flyer. I figured some- 
body ought to be there to break it to 
him gently. 

He gets off the train looking hap- 
py and successful and I figure he’s 
made arrangements to put a Para- 
dise booth in every city, town, and 
crossroads in the nation. 

“Why, hello, Harry,” he says 
when he sees me, and gives me the 
old professional smile and hand- 
shake that really ain’t the old Joe 
at all. “Any cabs around?” 

“No, there ain’t no cabs around.” 
Something in the way I says it 
makes him give me a sharp look. 
“How come? There’s always a cou- 
ple to meet the flyer.” 

“There ain’t none this time,” I 
says. “No cab drivers.” 

“No cab drivers?” 

“Ain’t no need for ’em any 
more,” I says. “Ain’t no people in 
town to use cabs. Town’s empty. 
Everybody’s gone.” 

He looks kinda green and says: 
“What do you mean, everybody’s 
gone?” 




96 



FRANK M. ROBINSON 



I shrugs and starts walking back 
to town. “Everybody took off,” I 
says. “Your Paradise booths were 
real popular.” 

He still looks blank so I give it 
to him straight. I had first thought 
about it when Wally Claus disap- 
peared. It occurs to me then that 
everybody has times when they wish 
they could crawl out from under 
and quietly disappear. You see, Joe 
had assumed that some people were 
adjusted to society and some 
weren’t. Well, actually nobody is, 
it’s just a difference of degree. 

Once Wally took off, it sorta 
burst the dam. More and more peo- 
ple sneaked into the booths, 
dropped in a quarter, and whisht — 
they were a billion miles away. 

It was lonely and dark in town. 
No street lamps, of course. There 
was nobody down at the power 
plant to work the switches. And 
there weren’t any lights in the 
houses ’cause there wasn’t anybody 
around. 

“I can’t imagine everybody go- 
ing,” Joe says, biting his lip. “What 
about all the kids?” 

“I kinda think they were among 
the first,” I says. I waves at the 
starry sky. “There’s probably a 
planet up there some place where 
there’s nothing but hot rods and 
football stadiums. And I suppose 
there’s one section of the universe 
fenced off for all the Junior Space- 
men that’ll be roaming around it.” 

Anybody you could think of 
mighta had a reason for leaving, I 
told him. The boys at Schultz’s 
probably took off for a world where 
Marilyn Monroe has a thousand 
twin sisters; and Johnny Douglas, 
the ace at Kelly’s Bowling Alley, is 



probably located on a world where 
it’s impossible to bowl anything but 
a three hundred game. 

By then, we were in front of Joe’s 
house. It was as dark and curtained 
as the others. 



T HE HOUSE was empty. The 
blinds had been drawn, the 
dishes neatly stacked and put away, 
and a note left on the doorstoop 
telling the milkman not to bring 
any more milk. 

The note to Joe was on the kitch- 
en table. It was hard for Joe to read 
on accounta it was blurred in spots 
where Marge had been crying and 
the tears had fallen on the paper. 
It told Joe — among a whole mess of 
other things— that she thought she 
had married a man, not a radio set, 
and since everybody was using them 
she was going to visit a Paradise 
booth that night. 

“What am I going to do?” Joe 
asks remorsefully. 

“That’s your problem,” I says 
heartlessly, thinking of all the chili 
dinners that went with Marge. 
“You made the booths in the first 
place.” 

“Yeah, I know.” He pulls out a 
wad of papers from his pocket and 
thumbs through them. “I got con- 
tracts here for a Paradise booth in 
every town over five thousand pop- 
ulation. I could be a millionaire in 
a month.” 

“Joe,” I says, suddenly fright- 
ened, “don’t do it. Look what hap- 
pened here in Fremont. Why man, 
if you put those things all over the 
country there wouldn’t be a soul 
left in the United States after a 
month had gone by.”

“-You’re right, Harry,” he says. 
“Absolutely right.” And he takes a 
cigarette lighter out of his pocket 
and sets fire to the papers and lets 
them burn ’til they’re nothing but 
ashes. 

“What are you gonna do with the 
booths in town?” I ask. 

He goes down to the basement 
and comes up with a hatchet. 
“Gome on,” he says grimly. “I’ll 
show you what I’m going to do with 
them!” 

The first two we chop in small 
pieces until the walk is covered with 
cogs and wheels and smashed tubes 
and dials. We stop at the third one. 
That was the fanciest one of all, 
with the leather upholstery inside 
and the big red neon sign on top 
that you could read halfway across 
town. 

Joe stares at it for a long minute, 
then makes up his mind. He fishes 
around in his pocket for a coin. 

“What do you think you’re going 
to do?” I asks, alarmed. 

“I’m going to look for Marge,” 
he says. “I need a vacation any- 
ways.” 

“How you gonna find her, Joe?” 
I asks. “You don’t even know what 
kind of a world to look for!” 

“Yes, I do,” Joe says wistfully. 
“It’ll be the kind of world where 
Marge always wanted to spend a 
vacation. Some place like up in 
Massachusetts during the summer. 
White beaches, little wooden 
houses, fishing boats and lobster 
pots . She’s described it to me so 



often I could picture it down to the 
last pebble on the beach.” 

He gets into the booth. 

“Think you’ll ever be back, Joe?” 
I asks. 

He drops a quarter in the coin 
slot and a picture builds up on the 
screen of a beach with a little town 
in the distance. 

“Sure,” Joe says confidentially. 
“We’ll be back.” And then there’s a 
flash of blue light and Joe’s gone, 
too. 

I hung around for a couple of 
days afterward but Joe and Marge 
never came back. I think he found 
her all right but Marge didn’t want 
anything to do with the old world 
so they just stayed there. 

And that’s about all there is, son. 
Except I’ve often wondered what 
happened when strangers drove 
through and found Fremont a ghost 
town . 



Now, lookahere, son, it’s no cause 
for you to go calling me a liar just 
because you never heard of Stellar 
Electric and Fremont ain’t listed on 
any map you’ve got. You didn’t ex- 
pect me to stay behind when 
everybody else had left, did you? I 
always had a hankerin’' for a dif- 
ferent type of world, too. 

A world where a body didn’t 
have to work so blamed hard and 
total strangers would be willin’ to 
listen to my stories and buy me a 
beer .

A Science Romance Began 
When Boy Met Flight 

OCKETS have existed for cen- 
turies as a primitive weapon, 
and many men have speculated on 
their possible use in carrying hu- 
man beings to the stars. In prac- 
tically all cases, such men have been 
laughed at as impractical dreamers. 
Today, however, rockets carrying 
instruments and animals can reach 
the heights of the stratosphere, 
guided missiles can come within 
inches of their pinpointed targets, 
jet planes can race through the air 
at twice the speed of sound and 
more, and the entire concept of in- 
terplanetary travel has become a 
seriously considered possibility 
rather than a vague dream. One of 
the men who deserves a great deal 
of credit for this change in the 
state of affairs is comparatively lit- 
tle known; his name is Theodore 
Von Karman. 

It was not Von Karman’s own 
idea to visit the small, laboriously 
cleared field which was serving as 
Paris’ first airport in 1906. He’d 
heard about the successful powered 
flight made three years before by 
the Wright brothers in America, 
but he hadn’t devoted too much 
thought to the subject. It was a 
young French newspaper woman, 




thrilled by the unusual assignment, 
who talked Von Karman into going 
with her to witness the first really 
long flight of an airplane. Whether 
she had any more personal motives 
for the invitation will never be 
known. It is certain, however, that 
the keen-eyed young man with the 
aquiline nose succumbed to her 
blandishments, saw his first plane in 
flight, and found his only true love. 
The romance of the air had caught 
him in its grip, and there is scarcely 
an aspect of the sciences of aero- 
nautics and astronautics that hasn’t 
profited from the love affair that 
ensued. 

The nature of the air and the un- 
known rules governing its behavior

have been the main field of inquiry 
for Professor Von Karman ever 
since that day in 1906. The turbu- 
lence, eddies and invisible whirl- 
pools of the air have tremendous 
effects on any object moving 
through this medium — a greater 
effect, even, than oceanic currents 
and tides have on the ships that sail 
the seas. Theodore Von Karman 
probed the turbulences, studied the 
vortex formations and developed 
the Theory of Vortex Streets, the 
actual mathematical formula for 
the effect of drag that these forma- 
tions produce on objects present in 
the air. He studied not only the air 
and its behavior, but also the be- 
havior of objects under the stresses 
and strains of high speed flight, and 
produced successful theories for the 
manufacture and design of planes 
that have revolutionized that indus- 
try with incredible speed in the 
short span of 50 years. Because of 
him mankind is flying higher, fast- 
er, farther, and more safely than 
even the most rabidly air-minded 
thought possible a short time ago. 

He developed, almost single- 
handed the theory of the behavior 
of the boundary layers of air, the 
theory of buckling beyond the elas- 
tic limit, the theory of the deforma- 
tion of curved pipes, and the non- 
linear theory of the stability of thin- 
walled shells. All of these govern 
the design of present-day aircraft. 

B ORN in Budapest in 1881, the 
son of a famed philosopher, he 
had received his mechanical en- 
gineering degree, taught in the 
schools, spent his compulsory year 
in the Austro-Hungarian army, and 



then taken a job as research en- 
gineer with a machine manufac- 
turer in Budapest. After that fateful 
morning at the Issy-les-Moulineaux 
Airport, designing machinery held 
no charm for Theodore Von Kar- 
man. With scarcely decent haste he 
quit his job and enrolled at the 
University of Gottingen in Ger- 
many as a graduate student, and 
won his Ph.D. and a place on the 
teaching staff after two years of 
studying mathematics, physics, and 
mechanics. Max Born, the great 
physicist, was on the faculty at Got- 
tingen and his interest in Von Kar- 
man’s ability in theoretical physics 
was so great that the two men 
worked together for some time. The 
first modern theories of the specific 
heats of solids were the results of 
this collaboration. 

With the exception of time spent 
as head of research in the Austro- 
Hungarian Aviation Corps during 
World War I, he spent the years 
from 1912 to 1926 as director of the 
newly erected Aeronautic Institute 
at Aachen, and as consultant to 
such famed aeronautical pioneers 
as Junkers, Zeppelin, and other 
German aircraft manufacturers. In 
1926 the Guggenhein Foundation 
invited him to the United States for 
a visit and lecture tour. Between 
lectures he helped to construct the 
wind tunnel facilities at the Gug- 
genheim Laboratories. Continuing 
on around the world after his stay 
in America, he introduced the first 
all-metal propeller and the first 
wind tunnel to Japan before return- 
ing to Aachen. 

Since he established his perma- 
nent residence in California in 
1930, the Guggenheim Aeronau-

deal Laboratory at Cal Tech under 
his direction has become tops in the 
field. The ground work for super- 
sonic flight, a supersonic wind tun- 
nel, and several far-sighted rocket 
projects were notable firsts in the 
field under his leadership. He was 
pioneering in the fields of rockets 
and jet propulsion long before they 
were thought feasible by military 
men. 

During World War II, Von Kar- 
man headed the Scientific Advisory 
Group and was special consultant 
to General “Hap” Arnold of the 
Army Air Forces. He also worked 
with the Ordnance Corps on the 
initial development of long range 
rockets. 

Despite his pioneering, and the 
proof his genius in his field, he was 
coldly turned down by numerous 
American manufacturing corpora- 
tions when he tried to interest them 
in building and manufacturing 
rockets for the Army. To disprove 
the general notion that scientists are 
dreamers with no financial sense, 
and because he knew the Axis na- 
tions were far ahead of us in re- 
search on the use of rockets as 
weapons, he persuaded four of his 



associates from the California In- 
stitute of Technology to join him 
in a venture that the manufactur- 
ing brains of the nation had 
thought a “wild scheme.” The five 
raised $8,700 among themselves 
and started the Aerojet Engineer- 
ing Company at Azusa, Cal., with 
just five employees. In ten years the 
manufacture of the ten-inch thick 
by three-foot long rockets that help 
to get big, heavily laden planes off 
the ground had grown to a $25,- 
000,000 business. 

Theodore Von Karman, who in 
addition to his theoretical work is 
an ardent teacher, philosopher and 
historian, has retired from the presi- 
dency of Aerojet and remains on as 
chief research consultant. That way 
he is able to spend what leisure time 
he has after teaching pursuing his 
favorite hobbies — collecting antique 
furniture and adding to a collection 
of 16-mm films which spans thirty 
years. The only devotion that 
Theodore Von Karman has al- 
lowed himself beside the work he 
loves has been given to his sister, 
Dr. Josephine Von Karman, who 
was his inseparable companion un- 
til her death.

TAPE JOCKEY 

By Tom Leahy 



HE LITTLE MAN said, “Why, 
Mr. Bartle, come in. This is in- 
deed a pleasure.” His pinched face 
was lighted with an enthusiastic 
smile. 

“You know my name, so I sup- 
pose you know the Bulletin sent me 
for a personality interview,” the 
tall man who stood in the doorway 
said in a monotone as if it were a 
statement he had made a thousand 
times — which he had. 

“Oh, certainly, Mr. Bartle. I was 
informed by Section Secretary An- 
drews this morning. I must say, I 
am greatly honored by this visit, 
too. Oh heavens, here I am letting 
you stand in the doorway. Excuse 
my discourtesy, sir — come in, come 
in,” the little man said, and bustled 
the bored Bartle into a great room. 

The walls of the room were lined 
by gray metal boxes that had spools 
of reproduction tape mounted on 
their vertical fronts — tape record- 
ers, hundreds of them. 

“I have a rather lonely occupa- 



tion, Mr. Bartle, and sometimes the 
common courtesies slip my mind. It 
is a rather grievous fault and I beg 
you to overlook it. It would be 
rather distressing to me if Section 
Secretary Andrews were to hear of 
it; he has a rather intolerant atti- 
tude toward such faux pas. Do you 
understand what I mean? Not that 
I’m dissatisfied with my superior — 
perish the 'thought, it’s just that — ” 
“Don’t worry, I won’t breathe a 
word,” the tall man interrupted 
without looking at the babbling fel- 
low shuffling along at his side. “Mr. 
Pettigill, I don’t want to keep you 
from your work for too long, so I’ll 
just get a few notes and make up 
the bulk of the story back at the 
paper.” Bartle searched the room 
with his eyes. “Don’t you have a 
chair in this place?” 

“Oh, my gracious, yes. There 
goes that old discourtesy again, 
eh?” the little man, Pettigill, said 
with a dry laugh. He scurried about 
the room like a confused squirrel

until he spotted a chair behind his 
desk, “My chair. My chair for you, 
Mr. Bartle!” Again the dry laugh. 
“Thanks, Mr. Pettigill.” 

“Arthur. Call me Arthur. For- 
mality really isn’t necessary among 
Mid Echelon, do you think? Sec- 
tion Secretary Andrews has often 
requested I call him Morton, but I 
just can’t seem to bring myself to 
such informality. After all, he is 
Sub-Prime Echelon. It makes one 
uncomfortable, shall we say, to step 
out of one’s class?” He stopped talk- 
ing and the corners of his mouth 
dropped quickly as if he had just 
been given one minute to live. “You 
—you are only Mid Echelon, aren’t 
you? I mean, if you are Sub-Prime, 
I shouldn’t be — ” 

“Relax, Mr. Pettigill— ‘Arthur’ 
— I am Mid Echelon. And I’m only 
that because my father was a man 
of far more industry than I; I in- 
herited my classification.” 

“So? Well, now. Interesting — 
very. He must have been a great 
man, a great man, Mr. Bartle.” 

“So I am told, Arthur. But let’s 
get on with it,” Bartle said, taking 
some scrap paper and a pencil stub 
from his tunic pocket. “Now, tell 
me about yourself and the 
Melopsych Center.” 

“Well,” the little man began with 
a sigh and blinked his eyes peculiar- 
ly as though he were mentally shuf- 
fling events and facts like a deck of 
cards. “Well, I — my life would be 
of little interest, but the Center is 
of the utmost importance. That’s 
it — I am no more than a physical 
extremity that functions in accord 
with the vital life that courses 
through the great physique of the 
Center! No more — I ask no more 



than to serve the Center and in 
turn, my fellow citizens, whether 
they be Prime, Sub-Prime, Mid, or 
even Sub-Lower!” 

He stopped speaking, affecting 
a martyr-like pose. Bartle covered a 
smile with his hand. 

“Well, Bartle, as you know, the 
Center— the Melopsych Center, a 
thoroughly inadequate name for 
the installation I might say — is the 
point of broadcast for these many 
taped musical selections contrived 
by Mass Psych as a therapeutic 
treatment for the various Echelon 
levels. It is the Great Psychiatrist — 
the Father Confessor. For where 
can one bare one’s soul, or soothe 
one’s nerves and disposition frayed 
by a day’s endeavor, better than in 
the tender yet firm embrace of 
music?” 



B ARTLE was straining to follow 
the train of thought that was lost 
in the camouflage of Pettigill’s flow- 
ery phraseology. 

“You see all about you these 
many recorders, Mr. Bartle?” 
Bartle nodded. 

“On those machines, sir, are 
spools of tape. Music tapes, all mu- 
sic. My heavens, every kind: classi- 
cal music, jazz, western, all kinds of 
music. Some tapes are no more 
than a single melodious note, sus- 
tained for whatever length of time 
necessary to relax and please the 
Echelon level home it is being 
beamed to. Oh, I tell you, Mr. Bar- 
tie, when the last tape has expended 
itself for the day, as our service code 
suggests, I leave this great edifice 
with a feeling of profound pride in 
the fact that I have so served my 




TAPE JOCKEY 



103 



fellow man. You share that feeling 
too, don’t you Mr. Bartle?” 

Bartle shrugged. Pettigill paused 
and looked at the watch he carried 
on a long chain attached to a clasp 
on his tunic. 

“A Benz chronometer, given to 
me by Section Secretary Andrews 
on the completion of my twenty- 
five years of service. It’s radio-syn- 
chronized with the master time- 
piece in Greenland. It gives me a 
feeling of close communion with my 
superiors, if you understand what I 
mean.” 

Bartle did not. He said, “Am I 
keeping you from your work? If I 
am, I believe I can fill in on most of 
this back at the paper ; we have files 
on the Center’s operation.” 

The little man hurriedly put out 
a hand to restrain Bartle who was 
easing out of the chair. 

“Not yet, Mr. Bartle,” he said, 
suddenly much more sober. Then 
his incongruous pomposity ap- 
peared again. “My gracious, no, 
you aren’t keeping me from my 
work. I just must start the Mid- 
Lower Echelon tape. It won’t take 
a moment. Tonight, they receive 
‘Concerto For Ass’s Jawbone.’ 
Sounds rather ridiculous, doesn’t 
it? Be that as it may, there is a cer- 
tain stimulation in its rhythmic 
cacophony. Aboriginality — yes, I 
would say it arouses a primitive 
exaltation.” 

He flicked a switch above the 
recorder, turned a knob, and 
pressed the starter button on the 
machine. The tape began winding 
slowly from one spool to another. 

“Is it ‘casting’?” Bartle asked. “I 
don’t hear a thing.” 

Pettigill laughed. “My stars, no; 



you can’t hear it. See- — ” He 
pointed at a needle doing a staccato 
dance on the meter face of the ma- 
chine. “That tells me everything is 
operating properly. Mass Psych ad- 
vises us never to listen to ’casts. The 
selections were designed by them 
for specific social and intellectual 
levels. It could cause us to experi- 
ence a rather severe emotional dis- 
turbance.” 

A peculiar look came over Bar- 
tie’s face. “Is there ever a time 
when all the machines run at once? 
That is, when every Echelon home 
is tuned to the melopsych tape- 
casts?” 

Pettigill registered surprise. 
“Why, certainly, Mr. Bartle. Don’t 
you know Amendment 34206-B 
specifically states that all Echelon 
homes must receive music therapy 
at 2300 hours every night? Of 
course, different tapes to different 
homes.” 

“That’s what I mean.” 

‘Haven’t you been abiding by the 
directive, Mr. Bartle?” 

“I told you I owed my classifica- 
tion to my father’s industry. I am 
definitely lax in my duties.” 

Pettigill laughed — almost 
wickedly, Bartle thought. 

“What I’m getting at, is,” Bartle 
continued, “what if the wrong ’casts 
were channeled into the various 
homes?” 

“I remind you, sir, I am in 
charge of the Center and have been 
for thirty years. Not even the slight- 
est mistake of that nature has ever 
occurred during that time!” 

“That, I can believe, Pettigill,” 
Bartle said, his voice edged with 
sarcasm. “But, hypothetically, if it 
were to happen, what would the re- 




104 



TOM LEAHY 



action be?” 

The little man fidgeted with his 
watch chain. Then he leaned close 
to Bartle and said in a barely audi- 
ble whisper, “This isn’t for publica- 
tion in your article, is it?” 

“You don’t think the Govern- 
ment would allow that, do you? No, 
this is to satisfy my own curiosity.” 
“Well, since we’re both Mid 
Echelon — brothers, so to speak — I 
suppose we can share a secret. It 
will be disastrous ! 1 firmly believe it 
will be disastrous, Mr. Bartle!” He 
moved closer to the tall man. “I re- 
call a secret administrative directive 
we received here twenty years ago 
concerning just that. In essence, it 
stated that, though music therapy 
has its great advantages, if the pat- 
tern of performance were broken 
or altered, a definite erratic emo- 
tional reaction would develop on 
the part of the citizens! That was 
twenty years ago, and I shudder to 
think what might be the response 
now; especially if the ’cast were 
completely foreign to the recipient.” 
He gave a little shudder to em- 
phasize the horror of the occurence. 
“It would make psychotics of the 
entire citizenry! That’s what would 
happen — a nation of psychotics!” 
“The fellow who didn’t hear the 
‘miscast’ would be top dog, eh, Pet- 
tigill? He could call his shots.” 

P ETTIGILL twirled the watch 
chain faster between a forefinger 
and thumb. “No, he’d gain noth- 
ing,” he said, staring as though 
hypnotized by the whirling, gold 
chain. “It would take more than 
one sane person to control the 
derelict population. Perhaps — per- 



haps two,” he mumbled. “Yes, I 
think perhaps two could.” 

“You and who else, Pettigill?” 
Pettigill stepped back and drew 
himself erect. “What? You actually 
entertain the idea th — ” He 
laughed dryly. “Oh, you’re pulling 
my leg, eh, Mr. Bartle.” 

“I suppose I am.” 

“Well, such a remark gives one a 
jolt, if you know what I mean. 
Even though we are speaking of 
a hypothetical occurence, we must 
be cautious about such talk, Mr. 
Bartle. Although our government is 
a benevolent organization, it is ill- 
disposed toward such ideas.” He 
cleared his throat. “Now, is there 
anything else I can tell you about 
the Center?” 

Bartle arose from the chair, stuff- 
ing the scrap paper and unused 
pencil back in his pocket. “Thanks, 
no,” he said, “I think this’ll cover it. 
Oh yes, the article will appear in 
this Sunday’s edition. Thanks, Pet- 
tigill, for giving me your time.” 
“Oh, I wish to thank you, Mr. 
Bartle. Being featured in a Bulletin 
article is the ultimate to a man such 
as I — a man whose only wishes are 
to serve his country and his 
brothers.” 

“I’m sure you’re doing both with 
great efficiency,” Bartle said as he 
apathetically shook Pettigill’s hand 
and started toward the door. 

“A moment, Mr. Bartle — ” the 
little man called. 

Bartle stopped and turned. 
“I perceive, Mr. Bartle, you are a 
man of exceptional ability,” Petti- 
gill said and cleared his throat. “It 
seems a shame to waste such talent ; 
it should be directed toward some 
definite goal. Do you understand 




TAPE JOCKEY 



105 



what I mean? After all, we’re all 
brothers, you know. It would be for 
my benefit as well as yours.” 

“Sure, sure, ‘brother’,” Bartle 
snorted and left. 

He started for the paper office 
but decided to let the story go until 
morning. What the hell, he had a 
stock format for all such articles. 
The people were the same: selfless, 
heroic type, citizens working for the 
mutual good of all. Only the names 
were different. And yet, this Petti- 
gill had disturbed him. Perhaps it 
was something he had said that 
Bartle could not remember. 



H E WALKED into his warm flat 
and extracted the pre-cooked 
meal from the electroven. He ate 
with little relish, abstractly thinking 
of the foolish little cog in the gov- 
ernmental machine he had talked 
with that afternoon. Or was Petti- 
gill that foolish little cog? Bartle 
could not help but feel there was 
something deep inside him that did 
not show in that wizened and seem- 
ingly open little face. He thought 
about it the rest of the evening. 

He looked at the clock on the 
night table — 2300 hours. “Pettigill’s 
Lullaby Hour,” he thought. Bartle 
chuckled and switched off the bed 
light. He was asleep before the 
puffs or air had escaped from under 
the covers he pulled over himself. 

When the phone rang at 0300, 
Bartle was strangely not surprised, 
although, consciously, he was ex- 
pecting no call. 

“Hello,” he said sleepily. 

“Bartle? This is Pettigill.” The 
voice was Pettigill’s but the nervous, 
timid, quality was gone. “ I assume 



you did not hear the 2300 ’cast?” 
“You assume correctly, Pettigill. 
What d’you want?” 

“Come on over to the Center; 
we’ll split a fifth of former Section 
Secretary Andrews’ Scotch.” 

“What the hell do you mean?” 
“Were you serious about that 
‘therapy revolution’ we were talking 
about this afternoon?” 

“I’m always serious. So what?” 
“Excellent, excellent,” Pettigill 
laughed. “I’ve spent thirty years 
just waiting for such a man as you! 
No, I’m serious, my cynical friend 
— what position would you like in 
the new government?” 

“Let’s see — why don’t you make 
my descendants real peachy happy 
and make me, say. Administrator of 
Civilian Relations. That sounds big 
and important.” 

“Fine, fine! Tell me, Bartle — 
how are your relations with psy- 
chotics?” 

Bartle leaped to the floor. In- 
stantly he recalled what Pettigill 
had said that had disturbed him. 
When they had been discussing the 
repercussions of a miscast, Pettigill 
had said, “it will be disastrous” and 
not “it would be disastrous.” The 
devil had been planning just such a 
thing for God knows how long! 

“How many of ’em, Pettigill?” 
Bartle asked. 

“A lot, Bartle, a lot,” the little 
man answered. “I would say 170 
million! I might even say, a nation 
of psychotics!” He giggled again. 

A smile sliced through Bartle’s 
sallow cheeks. “My relations with 
them would be the best! Keep that 
Scotch handy, Pettigill. I’ll be right 
over.”

After rescue, revenge was uppermost in Chet Bar- 
field’s mind ; the hideous, bestial Agvars had to be 
taught a lesson they’d never forget. His rescuers 
seemed to disagree, however — until Chet learned his 
lesson too! 



xnt of a ‘Tftatt 

By Dave Dryfoos 

Illustrated by Rudolph Palais 



IN THE VILLAGE clearing, un- 
I der the diffuse red sun of Hedlot, 
Chet Barfield listened intently. 
Mostly he heard the villagers, the 
Agvars, noisy with the disregard for 
sound that comes of defective hear- 
ing. 

But above their clamor was an- 
other note. No . Yes! There it 
was again — the swish-roar-scream 
of a spaceship! 

Chet’s heart lifted to the altitude 
of that ship. Rescue! Rescue was at 
hand for him, after three years as 
a prisoner. 

Thought of it momentarily over- 
came the passivity that years of 
starvation had made his habit. He 
even forgot himself enough to walk 
erect a few steps, staring skyward 
— heavenward! — within cupped 

hands. 



But the dense hardwood chain 
on his ankle brought him up short. 
When it tightened, he remembered, 
and slouched to all fours again, 
moving with the gorilla-like gait of 
the Agvars toward the unshaded 
post he was chained to. 

He’d been observed. Pawfulls of 
dirt stung his bent and whip-scarred 
back, and a treble chorus stung his 
ears and nerves. The village boys 
were chanting derisively. Chet had 
never been able to learn the lan- 
guage, but the tone of voice was un- 
mistakable. 

He huddled against the post, 
knees to chin, hands clasped around 
his matted hair, awaiting the in- 
evitable sticks and slops. He heard 
the children’s voices fade as they 
scattered throughout the village of 
haphazard lean-tos in search of

especially sickening things to throw. 
For a few minutes, then, he’d have 
a breather. But not for long — they 
wouldn’t forget . 

No. But the fellows hadn’t for- 
gotten him, either. He could stand 
this for a day or two more. A week 
or a month, even. It didn’t matter. 
This would end — soon. 

His turn would come! He’d make 
these devils suffer as he had suf- 
fered. He swore it! 

He was glad he’d stayed alive for 
this. It had been a fight to live, a 
struggle he’d often thought futile 
while he made it. Learning to eat 
whatever he could get, training 
himself to breathe the local atmos- 
phere in the special rhythm its com- 
position required, accepting de- 
gradations too cruel for a captive 
animal, avoiding the resistance that 
would have brought merciful mur- 
der . All that, yet it felt strange, 
now, to be so glad he was alive. 

He heard the children returning, 
and crouched lower. A few clots of 
garbage spattered against the post 
— teasers, to make him angry, so 
he’d turn to howl his rage, and offer 
his face as a target. 

Good memories, these little beasts 
had. It was almost a year since he’d 
last done that . 

Well, he had a memory, too. And 
while they pelted him — from fairly 
close range, now, with sharp rocks 
among the wads of filth — he could 
take refuge in the memory of those 
last glorious days on Earth. 



R emembrance was itself a 

change brought by the roaring 
ship; usually he moped in a vegeta- 
tive daze. But now he recalled how 



he’d looked in the tight white uni- 
form : six feet of well-fed muscle ac- 
centuated by the garment’s lines, 
the blue stars on each lapel just 
matching his eyes, the peak of his 
cap harmonizing with the straight 
line of his jaw. 

He ■ remembered how he’d 
sounded, speaking words of non- 
chalant and unfelt modesty in the 
soft Southern voice the girls had 
liked so well. He could have had his 
pick of girls. He’d been a picked 
man himself. 

Highly selected — that was the 
phrase. He was highly selected, 
Chet reminded himself, shrinking 
as the children came closer and 
their missiles began to really hurt. 

He’d been highly selected since 
his eighteenth year. At 25 he’d had 
seven years of pre-flight training — 
seven years of indoctrination speci- 
fically designed to give him self- 
confidence enough to face the void 
itself without flinching. 

Now he flinched from children 
. Still, the schooling had worked, 
he acknowledged — so well that 
when their ship crashed into this 
planet Hedlot’s salty sea, his first 
reaction had been indignation at 
the elements. 

His second thought had been for 
his comrades. But they went down 
with the ship; he alone had been 
hurled clear. Learning that, he’d 
swum resolutely in the direction he 
knew the shore to be, and made it. 

Exhausted, all right— shocked, 
naked, half-dead really. But quite 
ready to point out his rank and 
identity to the first passer-by. 

Lucky for him, Chet mused, that 
he’d had no chance to express his 
callow arrogance. Shock saved his

Kfe — sank him into a stupor, so 
when the Agvars found him, he 
was helpless. He knew it was only 
because it had seemed perfectly 
safe that they’d tied him up and 
brought him to the village, instead 
of killing him then and there. 

By the time he’d recovered some- 
what from the initial shock and ex- 
haustion, they were used to him, 
convinced he was harmless if well 
chained-up. And they played it safe 
by giving him nothing but a little 
water — no clothing, no shelter, no 
food . 

They let him live, amused by the 
thirst that drove him to lap up each 
morning’s drenching dew, fas- 
cinated by his ravenous appetite for 
the garbage they flung at him. 

The Agvars — furry, savage half- 
men, with something of the dog and 
something of the ape and little of 
the man about them — the Agvars 
let him live, Chet realized, for ex- 
actly one reason: he made them 
feel superior. 

They’d learn now! Even though 
the children had stopped shrieking 
and gone away, disgusted at his 
passivity, no villager’s insensitive 
ears could yet hear the ship. 

In their boastfulness, the Agvars 
had invited other tribes to come 
and look at him and poke at him 
and laugh at him. His presence was 
known over the whole planet. He’d 
be found, no matter where on Hed- 
lot the spaceship landed. 

And then would come the show- 
down! 



B UT THE showdown came ear- 
lier than he expected, speeded 
because the ship landed close by. 



Chet told himself he should have 
counted on that kind of accuracy, 
but he’d underestimated his fellow 
pilots. 

He had himself signalled Earth- 
side, just before the crash, that his 
ship was about to land. He’d given 
his position — described sea and 
shoreline. They’d find him, if he 
stayed chained to the post. 

But he didn’t. Taken unaware by 
the Agvars who loosed him, Chet 
was docile, happy even — certain 
they wouldn’t hurt him now, but 
would try to minimize their former 
cruelty as they turned him over to 
the spacemen. 

When they put new chains on 
him, around neck and waist, he 
thought it was only to make sure 
he didn’t run away before they 
could deliver him ostentatiously to 
the ship. 

A dozen adult males had 
gathered in the clearing, but that 
was hardly an unusual event. Even 
when they all started out, on a 
winding trail that didn’t head in 
the direction of the ship’s recent 
landing-sounds, Chet was con- 
vinced they were just circling some 
geographic obstacle. 

He was interested in the forest of 
20-foot mosses and 50-foot ever- 
green hardwoods pressing densely 
on each side of the trail. Uncon- 
scious when they’d carried him 
from the beach, he’d never been 
out of the village since, had never 
inspected these woods. And he 
thought his mates from Earth 
would want to know about them. 

Chet could easily have outdis- 
tanced the clumsy Agvars if not 
forced to imitate their crouching 
walk. But he knew from experience 




110 



DAVE DRYFOOS 



that to show off his erect stance and 
18-inch height-advantage would 
make them find some unpleasant 
way to put him in his place. 

They’d shown him that quite 
often. He’d show them — but later, 
not just yet. And after showing 
them, he’d put these Agvars be- 
hind him — them, their filthy planet, 
and their scorching sun. 

It had often tortured him, that 
gauzy, amorphous solar blaze, but 
never more than now. For the sun 
of Hedlot, when he glanced at it 
vengefully, proved from its position 
that he was not being taken to the 
ship, but away from it. 

D isappointment didn’t 

rouse Chet to a fighting pitch 
— it caused him to become crafty. 
Slyness and deceit, the indirect 
weapons of the powerless, were not 
attributes schooled into a student 
space-pilot. But he’d learned them 
tied naked to a sunbaked post. 
That, too, is an effective school. 

He hung back, faking fatigue. 
Malingering brought him pokes 
and jerks, made the Agvars choke 
him and beat him and harangue 
him in their sullen mutter of clicks 
and growls and glottal catches. But 
some sense of urgency drove them 
to give up their fruitless sadism 
after a while, and drag him through 
the trail’s blue mud by brute 
strength, two on the neck-chain, 
two hauling at his waist. 

He let them. Not that he was 
inured to pain — he just was stub- 
born. 

He wondered, once when they all 
stopped at a spring for a drink and 
some rest, whether their harangu- 



ing showed the Agvars were sorry 
they hadn’t taught him their lan- 
guage. Probably not, he decided; 
probably they didn’t want to think 
he could have learned it. 

He’d tried, in the absence of les- 
sons, by repeating what he heard 
around him. He’d learned a few 
words, of course. And for a while, a 
couple of villagers had seemed to 
enjoy and encourage his parrot- 
like attempts to recite whole sen- 
tences they voiced for him. But 
after a few beatings, Chet gathered 
that he’d only been mouthing 
obscenities. And that experience, 
plus inertia, had made him give up 
the attempt. 

Just as well, he now decided. If 
they’d known of his technical 
skills, if they’d let him raise their 
standards, the Agvars might be 
carrying bows and arrows, instead 
of mere slings and sticks. 

Their hard luck! What they 
didn’t know, they’d never learn 
from him! The mere presence of 
a spaceship on the same planet gave 
him a buoyant feeling of contempt. 

But though contempt helped 
him endure that journey through 
the tall mosses and taller trees, it 
couldn’t ward off exhaustion. 
When the party stopped at the foot 
of a sheer rock spire that rose four 
or five hundred feet above the tall- 
est growth, he collapsed and slept. 

T HEY WOKE him in the pre- 
dawn twilight and another 
group of Agvars took over. These 
— there were only three — looked 
older than the familiar villagers. 
And they’d smeared their faces 
with bands of red and yellow mud. 




UNIFORM OF A MAN 



111 



He wondered. 

He stopped wondering when 
they passed a pile of bones at the 
base of the spire. Among the grisly 
relics were skulls — brow-ridged, 
pointed, unmistakably Agvar. Sac- 
rifices! 

He was to be killed, then, to 
propitate his own rescuers. His 
three guides — or guards — must be 
witch-doctors! He let them drag 
him along while he thought about 
it. 

They’d give him no breakfast, 
not even water. If they’d eaten 
themselves, it was while he still 
slept. The scraps, if any, hadn’t 
been flung in his face, and there’d 
been no smooth post to lick the 
dew from. 

Hunger and thirst were nothing 
new, but neither was the resulting 
lethargy. Realizing his danger, Chet 
could only hang back. 

Today though that was an old 
stall; the witch-doctors seemed to 
expect it. They broke branches 
from the trees and beat him till he 
bled. And when the climb up the 
rocks began, they put one of their 
number behind him to push, set the 
other two in front to pull, and tried 
by main strength to haul him up 
the five hundred foot rock-face. 

Hazily, not hastily, Chet tried to 
think of a way out. His starved 
brain could come up with nothing. 
That, he finally decided, was only 
natural; it was not thinking that 
was needed, but action. 

Still, he wasn’t precipitate. Cau- 
tion reinforced his habitual lassi- 
tude while trying to dispell it. Half 
a dozen times he tensed for com- 
bat, only to relax hopelessly. But 
finally he found a place — and the 



will— -to make a stand. 

He passed up a wide shelf, and 
let them tug him along a narrow 
ledge without much objection. He 
chose a near-vertical pitch about a 
hundred feet from the bottom — a 
mere crack that slanted upward to 
the right, offering the shallowest 
of hand-and foot-holds. 

He could only hope that he 
wasn’t in sight from the trail — or 
else that the villagers had left. He 
couldn’t see through the treetops 
to make sure. But he hadn’t the 
strength to worry. 

He froze to the rock, pulling as 
if in fright. The two witch-doctors 
in single file above him jerked on 
the chains they held. But they 
needed a hand apiece to hold on 
with, and couldn’t lift him. 

The one below, standing on a 
six-inch ledge, tried to push. When 
that didn’t work, he broke off a 
chunk of rock and beat Chet’s left 
foot with it. 

Spurred by the sudden pain, 
Chet kicked the witch-doctor in the 
face. The Agvar fell, screaming — 
until he crashed through the tree- 
tops and was still. 



T O CHET, forgetful of his hear- 
ing superiority, it seemed as if 
that outcry would be heard on 
Earth itself. Certainly he expected 
it to alarm the countryside. Still, 
unless the swift foot- thrust had 
been seen, no one would be sure 
the witch-doctor’s fall was not an 
accident. 

Chet had tasted victory for the 
first time in three years! He’d had 
a little revenge, and he wanted 
more. He could take the other two 




112

witch-doctors with him to death! 

He put all his weight on the 
chains they held. But they chose 
not to die — let go, instead, to save 
themselves. The chain-ends rat- 
tled past, dislodging a small ava- 
lanche of dust and gravel and 
bruising stones — dislodging him 
when the full weights jerked at 
neck and waist. 

Prepared, he didn’t let himself 
be pulled away from the cliffs face. 
He slid down it to the ledge from 
which the Agvar below him had 
fallen. There he teetered a mo- 
ment, balancing precariously on 
toes scraped raw in his slide. Claw- 
ing fingers found a crack to the 
right, a knob to the left — safety! 
He clung there breathless. 

No time for resting! Rattling 
stones warned of pursuit. He looked 
quickly around, found a route, and 
after a short traverse let himself 
slide to a long talus-slope. Down 
it he ran barefoot through sharp 
debris into concealing mosses. 

The silence alarmed him. But it 
freed him from the need for craft; 
he didn’t know what to avoid nor 
where it might be lurking, so he set 
out for the spaceship by what he 
hoped was the shortest way. 

In the village, he’d located the 
landing-place by sound, fixed it by 
sun. The sun would guide him now. 
Not accurately, but well enough. 

The ship would have landed in a 
clearing. Standing on its tail, it 
should loom high over the woods. 
And its men would scatter — he 
ought to run into one. 

Run he did, trotting under 
thirty pounds of hardwood chain 
on reserves of strength dredged 
from a deep pit of desperation, 



through a forest overgrown with 
menace, full of life he could always 
sense but seldom see — of noises 
whose origin he couldn’t guess. 

The Agvars, for all their inferior 
hearing, could at least interpret 
what they heard. Chet couldn’t. 
Every whispered cry, wild grunt 
and muttered growl was completely 
unfamiliar. He didn’t know which 
sound signalled danger. He feared 
them all. 

But more than sounds he feared 
the silence that chinked the logs of 
time between each nerve-wracking 
noise. Often he had to stop and 
rest, and silence threatened him 
then like the ominous quiet of bated 
breath. When he’d force himself 
to go on, each tree seemed like a 
porchful of malicious old women, 
pretending to disregard him as he 
passed, certain to make trouble 
when he’d gone. The buzz of small 
life-forms was a deprecatory mur- 
mur, ready at any second to burst 
into condemnation and terror. 

What was that sound? And that? 
Noises that seemed out of place in 
their familiarity pinned him to the 
forest floor. 

It was only the village. Satisfied, 
he worked up courage to skirt the 
place and walk on toward the ship. 

But he was near collapse. When 
he heard human voices he could 
only yell incoherently once or twice, 
sob, and pass out. 

D IMLY through succeeding days 
Chet was aware of the ship’s 
sickbay, of the enlisted attendants, 
the hovering doctor, the silent com- 
mander. Later he realized he’d 
been kept under opiates so his body 




UNIFORM OF A MAN

could recover while his mind rested. 
At the time, he felt only the dim- 
ness. 

It wore off abruptly. He was in 
a civilized cot, stretching luxurious- 
ly, aware of warmth and comfort 
and a cheerful voice that seemed 
familiar. 

He opened his eyes. A fat young 
corpsman had been watching. 

“How do you feel, sir?” the boy 
said. “Ready for coffee?” 

“Sure,” Chet answered. And 
grinned lazily as he sat up to sip 
the proffered cup. “You’ve taken 
good care of me.” 

“Used to be a barber in civilian 
life,” the boy said smugly. And 
Chet found with an exploratory 
hand that he’d been shaven and 
shorn, bathed, bandaged where 
necessary — even, he saw, clad in a 
pair of fancy red broadcloth pa- 
jamas. 

“You’ve got me cleaned up, all 
right,” he said. “Whose p.j.’s have 
I got on?” 

“Dr. Pine’s, sir. You’ll see him 
in a couple of minutes- — he and the 
Old Man been waiting to question 
you. There’s a robe and slippers, if 
you want me to help you get 
up. .” 

“I’m not helpless,” Chet said, 
boasting in his turn. He proved it 
by climbing — gingerly — out of the 
cot. The boy helped him into the 
robe, found the slippers, pushed the 
small room’s one chair an inch 
closer to the open porthole, and 
left, closing the door behind him. 



V AGUELY Chet found he knew 
the two men who soon entered 
the room — they’d been there be- 



fore. But this was his first fully 
conscious look at them. Command- 
er Seymour, the C.O., looked sur- 
prisingly young for his job. He was 
young, Chet decided — not over 
thirty-five — and his short slight 
figure made him seem younger 
still. 

He had few words. “You’re look- 
ing fine, Barfield,” he said, and sat 
on the edge of the cot, thin face im- 
passive, gray eyes alert. 

Dr. Pine — tall, balding, affable — 
was associated in Chet’s mind with 
hypodermic needles, bitter medi- 
cines, restrictions. Today, the doc- 
tor gave him a firm and friendly- 
handshake, but yesterday, Chet 
felt, that same hand had inflicted 
pain. 

“Glad to see you looking so 
well,” the doctor said, taking a 
stance against the wall by the port- 
hole. He sounded sincere enough, 
but Chet, resuming his chair, won- 
dered how much of the gladness 
was based on the doctor’s pride in 
professional handiwork. 

There was an awkward pause. 
Chet remembered to murmur po- 
lite replies to the men who were 
so obviously sizing him up. Then 
he asked, “When do you think I’ll 
be ready for duty?” 

His visitors exchanged a glance. 
“Later,” Commander Seymour 
said. “Take it easy while you can, 
Barfield.” He smiled unconvincing- 
ly at what must have been meant as 
a joke. 

Talk again lapsed, and Chet be- 
came uncomfortable. “The corps- 
man said you wanted to ask me 
some things,” he said. And added, 
“You’ve already questioned me, 
haven’t you?” 




114 



DAVE DRYFOOS 



“Only a little,” Dr. Pine said, 
flexing his long fingers and looking 
down at them. “We — ah — we had 
to find out about your shipmates. 
Commander Seymour wanted to 
look for them, naturally. .” 

Naturally. “Are we going to 
leave here now, sir?” Chet asked 
the commander. 

“Not yet,” he said. “Dr. Pine has 
a job to do.” 

“What’s that, Doctor?” 

"I'm going to study your Agvar 
friends, Mr. Barfield. Want to 
help?” 

“Sure,” Chet said. “There’s 
nothing I’d rather do than bring 
you a few corpses to dissect.” 

“That — ah — that isn’t the idea,” 
Dr. Pine said, bending his fingers 
and rocking from toes to heels. “I 
— ah — I want to do a little anthro- 
pology-study them in the life. 

“Why?” Chet demanded. “I can 
tell you all about them. I can tell 
you what they did to me, too! They 
don’t deserve to live! And this 
planet won’t be safe for spacemen 
till they’re dead. Why waste time 
studying them? It isn’t as if you 
were a professional anthropologist, 
sir — didn’t you give me medical 
care?” 

“Yes. But I do anthopology, 
too. Medical help — ah — gains the 
confidence of the people. .” 

“You mean — ?” Chet was at 
first incredulous, then outraged. 
“You mean you’re not going to 
punish them?” 

“That’s right,” Dr. Pine said, 
smiling. 

“That’s wrong!” Chet contra- 
dicted. 

Cheeks burning, he turned to 
Commander Seymour. “How about 



you, sir? Do you want your men 
chained to a post if they get cap- 
tured? Do you want me to dismiss 
three years of torture as a mistake, 
or something? Do you want — ” 

“Here, here!” Commander Sey- 
mour said. He didn’t raise his 
voice. But as he rose from the cot, 
Chet rose with him, and found 
himself at attention. They eyed 
each other. 

“Relax,” Dr. Pine suggested. 
“Please sit down— both of you.” 

Commander Seymour obeyed his 
subordinate. But Chet, still stand- 
ing, still angry, turned hotly on the 
doctor. 

“I can’t just sit and let you talk 
about rewarding the Agvars for tor- 
turing me!” he cried. “We don’t 
have to appease them — they can’t 
fight. You don’t have to be 
afraid — ” 

“That’ll do, Barfield!” Com- 
mander Seymour was on his feet 
again, and his tone was sharp. It 
quieted Chet instantly. 

In silence he watched Com- 
mander Seymour motion Dr. Pine 
to follow him out the door. Some- 
one locked it after them. 



A lternately tossing on the 

cot and pacing the floor, Chet 
seethed for hours. His first inter- 
view with the new C.O., and two 
bawlings-out in five minutes! Be- 
cause of Pine — Pine, who kept him 
confined in this room, seeing no 
one but the attendants, having his 
meals alone. 

When a day passed, and then 
two, and he felt his strength return- 
ing, Chet was sure that Dr. Pine 
kept him out of the wardroom and 




UNIFORM OF A MAN 



115 



away from the other officers only 
as punishment. Three years a pris- 
oner — and a prisoner still! By the 
time Commander Seymour came to 
see him again, Chet had spent 
hours plotting revenge. 

“Barfield,” the commander said, 
“Dr. Pine is going — alone — to the 
village you escaped from. He’ll pre- 
tend he’s you, or someone like you 
— whichever he can get away with. 
So here’s your chance for a little 
fresh air — you can guide us to the 
village.” 

“Does that mean I go on active 
duty, sir?” 

“Not quite. Dr. Pine hasn’t re- 
leased you from sickbay.” 

Pine again! Pine found him 
good enough to imitate, it seemed, 
but not good enough to put on 
duty. 

Suddenly Chet saw the possibili- 
ties. So Pine was going to imper- 
sonate him? Then Pine would be 
taken for an escaped sacrifice, a 
prisoner who’d killed a witch- 
doctor! 

Tell him? Huh. Let him find out 
the hard way! Then even he, yel- 
low as he was, would want revenge 
on the Agvars. If he survived their 
welcome. 

“I’ll be glad to go, sir,” Chet said. 



T HEY BROUGHT him fatigues, 
not a dress uniform. But fa- 
tigues and shoes — even tight ones 
— were clothing, at least. And 
clothing would change his appear- 
ance. The Agvars had never seen 
him dressed, nor, since his first days, 
with a haircut and shave. Whether 
Pine’s impersonation worked or 
not, Chet saw no danger for him- 



self in approaching the village. But 
he wondered how it was to be man- 
aged. 

He was told the plan when Com- 
mander Seymour and Dr. Pine met 
him outside by the ship’s tail. The 
commander, who was armed, and 
the doctor, already naked except 
for a pair of slippers and a sun- 
lamp tan, would go with him by 
the shortest route direct to the vil- 
lage. But only Dr. Pine would en- 
ter it. 

Commander Seymour explained 
Chet’s part — and his own. “Bar- 
field,” he said, “I want you to find 
and point out some kind of game 
animal they use for food. I count 
on killing something after we come 
under the Agvars’ observation. 
That should show off our weapon- 
superiority — and pave the way for 
a feast.” 

“No medical stuff?” Chet asked 
sarcastically. “I thought Dr. Pine 
was supposed to cure all their ills, 
not give them indigestion.” 

“He has to get their confidence 
before he can treat them,” Com- 
mander Seymour explained seri- 
ously. “And on a strange planet 
like this, he’s taking quite a chance 
to try treatment at any time: if it 
fails, they’re apt to accuse him of 
murder!” 

Chet said nothing. But he felt as 
if he’d drawn a wild card in a poker 
game. 

T HEY’D ENTERED the woods. 

Even before that, Dr. Pine had 
lagged because his slippers kept 
falling off, and now he brought up 
the rear. Chet, in the lead, took 
a last long look at the ship before 




116 



DAVE DRYFOOS 



the trees and mosses cut off his 
view. 

He went on slowed by vague re- 
luctance. He didn’t like this forest. 
The trees dwarfed and oppressed 
him. Old fears began to stir and 
gnaw, but at new places. 

Perhaps the two men he guided 
would stand together against him. 
If so, revenge on one would cut 
him off from both as sharply as the 
forest cut him off from the ship. 

Well, it was worth it! They 
hadn’t put him on duty, hadn’t 
accepted him as one of them- 
selves. He couldn’t be cut off 
much more than he was already! 

And Seymour might listen to rea- 
son. After all, he was a practical 
man, a leader. And Pine was 
yellow! 

“What’s Pine after, sir?” Chet 
asked over his shoulder. “Why 
take these risks you’ve mentioned?” 

“Well, partly for safety: if we 
kill any Agvars, we’re likely to have 
to kill them all, or have the sur- 
vivors to contend with indefinitely. 
That might cost us some casual- 
ties. And of course there’s the 
research angle, but that’s out of my 
line.” 

“What’s the matter with punish- 
ment, sir — discipline? You use dis- 
cipline on your crew — why not on 
their enemies?” 

“Because the men understand 
the rules and the penalties. The 
Agvars don’t.” 

“Kill them, sir! That they’ll un- 
derstand!” 

“No!” Commander Seymour 
spoke sharply. “If they don’t fight 
back, that’s cold-blooded slaughter. 
If they do, it’s war. I don’t hold 
with butchery, Barfield, and I cer- 



tainly won’t risk casualties just to 
give you a cheap feeling of satis- 
faction!” 

He couldn’t escape. Commander 
Seymour, looking from over Chet’s 
shoulder like a walking sneer, stuck 
close. But he gave the impression of 
following a man who smelled bad. 

Was he? Chet wondered. 

Wondering, he unconsciously 
hung his head, slowed — stopped. 
Dr. Pine caught up. He and Com- 
mander Seymour, faintly breathless 
from the trying need to regulate 
their respiration consciously, looked 
at Chet questioningly. 

Again they were sizing him up. 
Suddenly Chet wished he could go 
back to that first interview in the 
sickbay, and change all the things 
he’d said. 

“We can’t go on!” he blurted. 
“You don’t know what you’re get- 
ting into, Doctor!” 

“Oh?” said Dr. Pine agreeably. 
“I know more than you think, 
young feller.” He smiled encourag- 
ingly. 

“That— that I’ve killed a witch- 
doctor? That you may be taken for 
a murderer?” 

“Sure! You — ah — you talked 

about it under drugs. We . 
weren’t spying, Chet. We just 
wanted you to tell your story with- 
out reliving all the agony. It 
wasn’t intended as — ah — a trap. .” 
He massaged his fingers apologeti- 
cally. 

“No. Chet agreed. “But-I- 
was-trying-to-lead-yoa-into-one!” 

H AD HE SAID that aloud? Chet 
couldn’t be sure. 

He listened for his own voice. 




UNIFORM OF A MAN 



117 



The woods were quiet. His breath- 
ing seemed strangely loud. He held 
it — and heard the Agvars moving 
in the woods. Rustling, scraping, 
crackling — grunting their guttural 
dialog. Crashing! Threatening 
them! 

“Let’s go back!” he urged, try- 
ing to sound casual. But his trail 
was blocked. 

“Stick around,” Dr. Pine sug- 
gested easily. “You — ah — you 
haven’t said anything we didn’t 
know. We’re going right ahead.” 
“But why? Once more Chet was 
hotly incredulous. “To risk your 
life for a few stray facts? Become 
a casualty while trying to avoid 
casualties? It doesn’t make sense!” 
Dr. Pine stared at his own hands 
as if to hide his shyness in them. 
“As to the fact-seeking,” he said 
slowly, “well . it’s a matter of 
opinion. I’ve lost a few class- 
mates. Risks in research are com- 
monplace — and accepted as worth- 
while by most people. 

“And — ah — peace. You once 
called it appeasement, but it isn’t, 
always. Well, look. If we fought 
those Agvars, somebody’d have to 
take a patrol into their village and 
capture prisoners for our Intelli- 
gence, right?” 

Chet nodded dumbly. 

“Well, in a way, I — ah — am the 
peaceful equivalent of that patrol. 
The — ah — risk I run is less than if 
we had a war and a patrol skirmish 
as part of it, though. And why in 



the world not take for peace a risk 
we’d routinely accept in war?” 
Why not? But why not minimize 
it, just the same. The Agvars, in- 
visible but noisy, were all around 
them, now. At any moment the 
woods might rain spears. 

“It would be safer with two of 
us,” Chet said musingly. “Your 
knowledge of anthropology and 
medicine— mine of the people — ” 
“Barfield, you’re still on the sick- 
list,” Commander Seymour pointed 
out. He watched Chet’s face for a 
long moment before adding, “Still 
— if you’re over your sick-minced 
need for revenge — it’s possible Dr. 
Pine may find you fit. It’s up to 
him.” 

Chet was afraid to ask directly. 
He pleaded with his eyes. 

Dr. Pine grinned broadly at the 
both. “He’s ready for duty,” sir,” 
he said. 

Commander Seymour stepped 
back and scowled. “All right, Mr. 
Barfield,” he barked, “I’ll give you 
just three minutes to change to the 
uniform of the day!” 

Chet’s jaw dropped. His vision, 
also downcast, noted the fatigues 
he wore, the muddy shoes. Then he 
looked up, saw the twinkle in his 
C.O.’s eyes, and understood. 

In exactly three minutes he 
made the required change. He 
would enter the village as he’d left 
it — in the undress uniform of a 
Man.

The Electron Interferometer 

U NTIL 25 years ago, there was 
still controversy about whether 
electrons consisted of particles or 
waves. Then two scientists named 
G. J. Davisson and L. H. Germer 
demonstrated that they have the 
nature of waves. They accom- 
plished this by making electrons 
produce a diffraction pattern, one 
of the two methods by which light 
had been shown to consist of waves 
in earlier experiments. 

In the case of light, this is done 
by passing a beam through a very 
narrowly spaced grating so that its 
waves alternately reinforce and 
cancel one another, forming a dif- 
fraction pattern of light and dark 
bands. Davisson and Germer used 
a crystal for their grating in the 
electron experiment, with similar 
results. 

The second test originally de- 
vised for light used an interfero- 
meter, an instrument which splits a 
beam of light in two and forces one 
half to travel a longer route than 
the other. When the parts are re- 
united their waves are out of phase 
and the result is a pattern of inter- 
ference fringes. It was difficult to 
apply this test to electrons, however, 
since their wavelength is only about 

1 



one 100,000th that of light. Never- 
theless, the task has now been ac- 
complished, with a highly refined 
version of the interferometer, by a 
group of physicists at the National 
Bureau of Standards. 

The heart of the electron inter- 
ferometer is a series of three copper 
crystals only about four 10-mil- 
lionths of an inch thick. A beam 
of electrons passed through these 
is split and then recombined. On 
emerging from the third crystal, 
it is made up of a pair of rays which 
have been differently diffracted. 
The difference in the length of the 
paths the rays must travel can be 
varied by moving the first crystal 
back and forth or by exposing the 
electrons, to electric or magnetic 
fields within the instrument. 

The electron interferometer is 
more than just a testing device for 
an already established theory, how- 
ever. Its designers hope to improve 
on it so that it can be used as a 
measuring rod for various electric, 
magnetic and electronic purposes. 

Sugar and Spice 

V OU ARE more sensitive to bit- 
■*- ter tastes than any others. Next 
strongest taste is sour, followed by 
salt, with sweet bringing up the 
rear. This has been discovered by 
food technologists at the University 
of California. They found that hu- 
mans can detect sugar in the 
amount of one tablespoonful in two 
gallons of water and one tablespoon 
of salt in ten gallons of water. Hy- 
drochloric acid (the sour taste) can 
be spotted even when one table- 
spoonful is mixed with 40 gallons of 
water, while the presence of a table-

spoon of quinine in 1,000 gallons of 
water is still noticeable. The scien- 
tists plan to continue these tests 
with various types of food. 

No More Teeth? 

T’S VERY possible that there 

won’t be a sound human tooth in 
the world by 3,000 A. D. The only 
hope that we’ll keep our choppers 
lies in finding out what causes tooth 
decay and discovering means of 
preventing it. So says Prof. Reidar 
F. Sognnaes of the Harvard School 
of Dental Science, who urges the 
speeding up of research along these 
lines. 

Many of our old theories about 
teeth have had to be changed re- 
cently as new evidence has come to 
light. Tooth enamel was long 
thought to be dead tissue, for in- 
stance. Now it is known that this 
substance contains several different 
kinds of living matter. 

Dr. Sognnaes also recommends 
frequent brushing of the teeth, even 
though it is impossible to keep them 
perfectly clean — a person always 
has some micro-organisms and food 
debris in his mouth. “The most that 
can be said,” he adds unhappily, 
“is that if we did not clean our 
teeth they would be worse than they 
are.” 

How long has it been since you’ve 
seen your dentist? 

A-Bomb Precaution 

Y THE TIME the next war 
strikes — if it does — military per- 
sonnel and perhaps civilians may be 
equipped with small, easily worn 
devices that will accurately record 
the amount of radiation to which 



an atomic bomb casualty has been 
subjected. This potential life-saver 
is known as the dosimeter; it was 
designed by naval scientists and is 
being produced by the Coming 
Glass Works. 

The dosimeter contains a piece 
of supersensitive silver-activated 
phosphate glass. Worn as a locket, 
the device permanently records the 
radiation received; the amount can 
be measured immediately or weeks 
after the exposure by use of a spe- 
cial reading instrument. When il- 
luminated by ultra-violet light in 
this instrument, the phosphate glass 
emits fluorescent orange light in 
amounts proportional to the expo- 
sure the glass has taken in. Thus 
the proper medical treatment can 
be prescribed. 

The dosimeter is noteworthy for 
the range of radiation it can meas- 
ure: from doses as small as 10 
Roentgens, which is well, below the 
danger limit, up to several thou- 
sand Roentgens. 

How Old Are Your Arteries? 

A N INTERESTING application 
of the radioactive tracer prin- 
ciple of medicine is now in use to 
warn patients of possible arterio- 
sclerosis, heart attacks and apoplec- 
tic strokes. The test involves the use 
of a small amount of radioactive 
sodium injected into a vein in the 
arm. A Geiger counter is then 
placed over the subject’s chest to 
measure the radioactivity as the 
substance passes through the blood- 
stream in that area. The time is 
checked when the level of radio- 
activity drops to a specific point, 
and this shows the rate of blood

flow through strategic blood vessels. 

The critical level is reached in 
healthy 20-year old men in 20 sec- 
onds. The time is doubled at 40 
years and tripled at 60. Patients suf- 
fering from arteriosclerosis will 
show the results normally expected 
of an older person. 

The test, which takes only about 
35 minutes in all, was devised by 
Dr. Enrique Strajman, a Brazilian 
scientist working at the Donner 
Laboratory of the University of 
California. 

Up-To-Date Prospecting 

CINTILLATION detectors— 
supersensitive successors to Gei- 
ger counters — are being used by 
government and private industry 
to prospect for uranium by air. Al- 
though the method can’t pinpoint 
the locations of uranium deposits 
exactly, both the Atomic Energy 
Commission and the Interior De- 
partment are having considerable 
success in finding clues to potential 
deposits this way. 

The Interior Department uses 
instrument-equipped DC-3’s, while 
the AEC flies in Piper Cubs at lower 
altitudes. Reactions of the detec- 
tors in each case are marked on pa- 
per tape, synchronized with 35-mm 
cameras that simultaneously map 
the areas being explored. 

The aerial maps are posted as 
they are completed, with the sites of 
potential deposits clearly marked. 
Ground prospectors must take over 
from there, since the signs of radio- 
active deposits on the maps don’t 
distinguish between those that are 
workable and those that are thin 



and valueless. Hundreds of inde- 
pendent prospectors are using the 
maps, which have been concen- 
trated so far on the Colorado pla- 
teau and parts of South Dakota, 
New Mexico and Western Pennsyl- 
vania, in the hope of striking it rich 
through the high prices and bonuses 
the AEC pays for uranium ore. 

Number, Please? 

'TTIE DAY when you can pick up 
your telephone and dial a num- 
ber anywhere on the continent is 
being hastened by the Bell Tele- 
phone System. A big step in the 
plan was taken recently in Pitts- 
burgh where devices known as card 
translators were placed in regular 
service. 

Card translators determine 
where dialed calls should go and 
route them there as directly and 
speedily as possible. If one path is 
busy, the machines will select the 
next best, making decisions in split 
seconds. 

The card translator uses boxes 
containing 1,000 metal routing 
cards apiece — each card about five 
by 10/ 2 inches. The cards have 
identifying tabs so that one will 
drop from the stack for any particu- 
lar code that is dialed. Beams of 
light then pass through openings in 
or tabs on the card, falling on 
phototransistors which transmit the 
necessary signals to the rest of the 
equipment. 

So you’ll soon be able to call 
Aunt Minnie, who lives all the way 
across the country, as easily as the 
neighbors across the street!
