A DOG’S JOB 



T he other day we attended a con- 
ference in Boston on space, 
spacecraft and the Grand Desiign — 
that is, the overall purpose that 
should be, and probably is, behind all 
space efforts, namdy to spread the 
human race out beyond our own at- 
mosphere into other worlds circling 
our own sun — or other suns. You 
know. The kind of thing we’ve been 
writing about in magazines like this 
for nearly half a century. 

One of these months we’ll tell you 
more about some of the things that 
we heard about there in regard to 
the space program, but one of the 
most interesting lectures in the 
three-day conference, for our money, 
turned out to be that by our old 
friend R. C. W. Ettinger, who long- 
time readers will recall as the author 
of The Prospect of Immortality^ the 
best-selling book (first publish^ in 
extract form in our late companion 
magazine, Worlds of Tomorrow) 
whioh proposed immortality through 
freezing. Ettinger’s talk was not 
primarily about space travel. In fact, 
it was not even primarily about 
freezing — although, of course, he 
touched on both subjects, pointing 
out that one way around the limit- 
ing velocity of light was to freeze 
the crews of interstellar spaceships, 
thus making it possible for them to 
travel a few centuries if necessary 
and still be in reasonably good oper- 
ating condition on landing. What it 
was about, in essence, was nothing 
less than what life is all about, and 
why we ought to be doing things 
that we’re probably doing anyway. 



S uppose there was a dog (said Et- 
tiniger, as close as we can para- 
phrase an extemporaneous talk from 
memory) and someone gave him the 
job of building a bridge across the 
Mississippi River. He might have 
all the help he could summon U]j^ in 
the form of a thousand packs bf a 
million dogs each, all obedient to his 
will; but there would still be no hope 
that he could ever get the bridge 
built. Lacking hands, he could not 
build simple tools. Lacking sufficient 
intelligence, he could not invent more 
complicated ones. He could not pro- 
duce strong enough materials, and 
he could not hoist them into place 
if he had them; because building a 
bridge across the Mississippi River 
is simply not a job for a dog. 

I take it as laxiomatic (Ettinger 
went on) that we can define the 
purpose of life as discovering what 
the purpose of life is. It may be that 
we human beings, shaped as we are, 
mortal as we are, limited in our ca- 
pacities as we are, are simply not 
up to the job of discovering that 
purpose. But we have at least the 
hope that we can make ourselves 
wiser, increase our capacities, 
lengthen our lifespan. Perhaps dis- 
covering the imrpose of life is not 
a job for a man . but a job that 
men can do is to reshape themselves 
into something that can achieve it. 

N ow, this is not the sort of argu- 
ment (that one expects to hear 
in the middle of three days other- 
wise mostly devoted to stellar sig- 
natures and optimization of multiple

missions by use of permissive pro- 
gress-sequences, but it seemed to us 
then and still seemed to us that 
Robert Ettinger has opened a rather 
large can of worms. 

One of the troubles with writing 
science fiction about the reasonably 
far future is that, if we are fair to 
our subject, we find ourselves writ- 
ingi about characters who are no 
loniger entirely human. Their social 
customs differ from those of 1967. 
Their motives are not the same as 
ours; if they have hang-ups, they 
are not our hang-ups, if they 
are despondent or alienated, it is 
not for the reasons that impair 
our lives today. 

But maybe, thinking along Et- 
tinger’s lines, we can find a little 
more in common with those next- 
evolution descendants of ours than 
has heretofore been possible. They 
may be taller than we are, or balder, 
or healthier; and surely -they will 
be wiser, perhaps in ways that we 
cannot understand. But if Ettinger 
is right and they are some part of 
some Grand Design, perhaps we can 
recognize in them that it is our 
Grand Design they are working on. 

And perhaps what Ettinger said 
is only another way of saying what 
H. G. Weills said more than half a 
century ago: "We have suffered like 
animals long enough; it is time we 
began to suffer like men.” 

♦ 41 * 



T o change the subject, our con- 
science requires us to admit 
something. Now that you are (we 
hope) well hooked on James BILL’S 
brilliant Faust Alepk - NuU, we 
should confess to you that when we 
first read it, and enjoyed it enorm- 
ously, we were much perplexed about 
whether you would like it as well 
— because it is not, we admit, really 
a science-fiction story at all. It 
should by all rights appear in a mag- 
azine like Unknown or Beyond — 
if they still existed. Unfortunately, 
they don't; and so stories like this 
don't have a proper home in any 
magazine being published today. 

We would like to give them such 
a home from time to time. What do 
you think? Is an occasional fantasy 
a pleasant change now and then? Or 
should we stick to more orthodox 
science fiction? Hue and Cry will be 
waiting to hear your answers . 

And if, while we think of it, your 
interest in sorcery has been spurred 
by BMsh's novel and you want to 
read more about it, you can hardly 
do better than a book we just fin- 
ii^ed reading: Spirits, Stars and 
Spells, by L. Sprague and Catherine 
C. de Gamp. It's not an exi>ose, but 
it does have some hard-^headed things 
to say about the fallacies of most 
necromantic accounts — and may be 
a very necessary countermeasure 
after you've read Faust Aleph-Null!

THE FOKTUNES 
OF PEACE 

by C. C. MacAPP 

Illustrated by FINLAY 



Something strange was in orbit, 
too small to see, too powerful to 
escape — and it had caught them! 



T hat sector of the galaxy was 
Treaty territory — that is, open 
and unpoliced — so the Terran 
freighter bad every right to be there. 
Nevertheless, she was a long way 
from home; and, mankind being just 
fledged in space, with a relatively 
weak iSfpace Force, it was no wonder 
freighter had run into trouble. 



“Taintless” Wend, who was 
Earthborn but could no longer 
claim citizenship, sat watching the 
freighter’s image swell on the main 
viewscreen of the Kyshan ship 
aboard which he was either guest 
or prisoner. He saw no signs of 
damage, so the freighter must have 
been taken by subterfuge rather 
than assault. Junnabl — his present 
host — was a versatile pirate. 



7 





Wend turned to the Kyshan. ‘"Is 
this all you wanted me for? You 
could navigate her yourself. 1 know 
you read English as well as you 
speak it.” 

Junnabl grinned. That consisted 
of curling his upper lip (pasty- 
green like the rest of his skin) and 
drooping the comers of his mouth, 
showing several dozen close^acked 
sharp teeth, while his amber eyes 
changed not one whit. “Iss true 
spend effort to learn. Now looks 
not waste. Have splendid job for 
you. See, soon.” 

Wend shrugged. They had him 
over a barrel. He shouldn’t have 
holed up so close to Kyshan terri- 
tory. 

He heard a shuttleboat coupling 
to the aft lock, to take them over 
to the freighter. 

TT^ an hour later, he turned 
JoLfrom the captured ship’s con- 
trol console and faced Junnabl. “I 
woi^ play stupid. There’s nothing 
abo^ tibds i&e^ter that wouldn’t 
pass lor ordinary commercial 
ship» buti she’s too ship^ape, too 
perfedtly tuned up. A TSF crew, 
and 3 good one, manned her, 1 
would guess. Where are they now?” 
fast. Iss jpleasure hire smart man. 

Junnabl showed his teeth again. 
“Are in safe keeping. You guess 
fast. Iss pleasure hire smart man. 
You not love TSF. Correct?” 

Wend said, “I didn’t leave it un- 
der the most cordial circumstances. 
Still, Earth was my birthplace.” 

The Kyshan laced his longer- 
than-. human fingers before his thick 
chest. “Am not fool enough to ask 



big treason. Are sizes of treason, 
yes? This ship little sneak-play by 
TSF. Cargo of value somewhere, 
hidden. I want. When get, crew go 
free.” 

Like hell. Wend thought. They’re 
undoubtedly dead. He kept his face 
impassive and waited. 

Junnabl flicked a long palid- 
green finger at a collar-radio and 
said for the latter’s benefit, in Ky- 
shan, “Bring the Terran skipper’s 
uniform and other things.” Then he 
told Wend, in Engl^, ^Were well 
hidden aboard. Uniform iss now 
made to fit you. You get idea?” 
Wend tried not to scowl. “Sure, 
I get it. An impersonation. Haven’t 
you ever head of fingerprints and 
descriptions?” 

Junnabl said placidly, “I hire 
smart man, expect him fix details. 
Oh Norp — you know Norp? — 
are sealed orders this ship suppose 
pick up. You get, 1 get hidden cache, 
give you back little yacht I find 
you in, give you bundle money, 
shake hands, good-bye. Okay?” 
Wend couldn’t help grinning. He 
wondered if Junnabl actually ex- 
pected him to believe that. He said, 
“I’d have to land on Norp without 
uniform, first, to look at the setup.” 
Junnabl laced his long fingers 
again. “Of course. We go there 
next.” 

n 

D ressed like some space rousta- 
^ bout. Wend strolled by the 
TSF office, not too close. It wasn’t 
much — a small concrete building 
in the local style, on the east side of 

IP 



8 




the spaceport, away ifirom town. He 
could hear the clack of a typewrit- 
er inside. Outside the door a human 
corporal, wearing a bolstered nipter, 
loitered in the shade of a low, wide- 
spreading tree. Four small aircars 
were parked to one side of the 
building. Obviously TSF did little 
buiness on Norp, which wasn’t sur- 
prising. A Terran ship was a rarity 
here. 

What he had to get from the 
backwater office was a padlocked 
dispatch case. There was, it seemed, 
a list of five TSF officers who 
might call for it. Though the orders 
Junnabl had found didn’t specifical- 
ly say so. Wend was sure the local 
C.O. would have photos and finger- 
prints of all five. The one who’d 
fallen into Junnabl’s hands was a 
Commander Waldron, which meant 
nothing to Wend. He didn’t think he 
could risk a direct impersonation, 
an)Tway. 

Casually, he strolled toward the 
busy side of the field; turned be- 
tween two buildings and stopped, 
pretending to fiddle with the zip- 
per of his jacket. He was careful not 
to look at the Norpan who went 
by a little too hastily. So Junnabl 
had hired people to watch him. 

He stepped into the open again 
and looked for a visiphone booth, 
choosing one that was exposed on 
all sides. He didn’t want anyone 
sneaking up and using some listen- 
ing device. He entered and pulled 
the door shut. 

There was a directory-scanner. 
He deposited a coin and pimched 
for “Importers”; let the names scroll 
down across the viewer; stopped 



the device at “Vassun Garka, Inc., 
iExotic Foods.” It this were the 
same family .... He contributed 
another coin and waited. 

A polite Norpan face appeared 
on the screen. The slit-eyes blinked 
once. “Apologies, sir. I speak no 
Terran languages.” 

Wend answered in Kyshan, 
which he spoke better than Noipan. 
“Not needful.” He held up a plastic 
card with one of his aliases on it 
and an orange triangle in the cor- 
ner. He waited for the clerk’s eyes 
to widen at the implied credit rating, 
then said, “Secrecy desired. Is there 
someone familiar with the star called 
Hane?” 

The face — similar to a Kyshan’s 
but swarthier, the two races having 
diverged a little — twitched and 
became impassive. “I have not 
heard of such a star.” 

Wend nodded politely. “Per- 
haps a coincidence of names. I had 
dealings there once with a Loob 
Garka, also in the import business.” 
The clerk said tonelessly, “If you 
will wait, I will make inquiries, sir.” 
The face vanished. 

Minutes passed, then a more ma- 
ture face appeared on the screen. 
The eyes glanced at the credit- 
voucher. “I do not know you, sir, 
nor do I know Loob Garka. But 
how may I serve you?” 

“Perhaps you know me as' ‘Taint- 
less’ Wend.” 

The face changed just slightly. 
“Ah.” 

Wend said, “I am followed. I 
would discuss mutual profit, but 1 
must evade watchers in a way that 
would not arouse suspicions.”

The teetli showed in a smile. 
**You flatter me in seeking my ar- 
rangements in such a matter. But 
go, in ten minutes, to the Chief Dis- 
patcher of airtaxis and ask him, 
loudly enough to he overheard to 
send you to the Vale of Amethyst 
Joys. He will, instead, place you 
with a trustworthy driver who will 
bring you to the Cradle of Mercies, 
Where I will meet you. It will be 
arranged that you are not followed.” 

T he Cradle of Mercies, though it 
undoubtedly catered to the 
cruder desires as well as the more 
delicate ones, was relatively quiet 
and meticulously clean. The lobby 
was dimly lit, and scented with 
something like lavender plus sandal- 
wood. Various curtained portals led 
off it. From one came a buzz of 
Norpan voices and a fan of light as 
a provocatively clad female held 
the curtain aside for a moment to 
gaze around the lobby. 

The attendant who’d instantly ap- 
proached Wend led him through a: 
different door, along a dim corridor, 
and into a small, plain, well lighted 
room. The Norpan to whom Wend 
had talked via visiphone sat cross- 
legged on a thick cushion, across a 
low table from a similar cushion. 
The attendant left, closing the door. 
Wend’s host glanced at the bolt on 
the inside of the door. 

Wen — now understanding the 
courtesy of letting him bolt the 
door — did so. He appreciated the 
cushion, too, which meant his host 
knew enough about him to know 
he’d be comfortable on it. A strange 
Terran would be given a chair. 



On the low table were two self- 
warmed bowls holding, respectively, 
roasted nuts and what looked like 
an equivalent of barbecued prawns. 
A generous decanter was neck-full 
of an amber liquor. Two tumblers 
of opalescent crystal waited. Wend 
seated himself and answered his 
host’s slight bow. The Norpan 
glanced at the decanter, then, as 
Wend made the palm-up gesture of 
assent, poured liquor. Not until each 
had sipped did he speak. “You hon- 
or me. I am Vassun Garka, and 
Loob Garka is my cousin. How 
may I serve you?” 

Wend speared one of the prawns 
with a small silver skewer. “Mine 
is the honor. You know, doubtless, 
that I arrived on a Kyshan corsair.” 
Vassun turned a palm up. “Yes. 
Junnabl’s.” 

Wend continued, “Junnabl has 
conscripted me for a bit of theft. 
If the booty is what I suspect, I 
am not adverse to taking some of it. 
However, I do not want to share it 
with Junnabl, nor do I care to rely 
upon his promises.” 

Vassun looked amused. “You 
find my own race more reliable?” 
Wend grinned. “There are Nor- 
pan pirates as deadly as Junnabl. But 
I feel your own family is more likely 
to let me live. How is Loob, by the 
way?” 

The . Norpan chose a roast nut. 
“Active, and still unhanged. You 
mentioned his home base. 1 hope 
this project of Junnabl’s does not 
lie in that direction?” 

Wend turned a palm down. “Jun- 
nabl has mentioned no direction, and 
does not yet have , one. Perhaps I

11 




should not have mentioned Hane." 

“It does not matter/’ Vassun said. 
•The clerk is discreet.” 

W end sipped more of the liquor, 
which was like fortified 
^e. “Well, here’s the project.” He 
told about the secret orders. •‘What 
I hope to do is switch dispatch 
cases. 1 have a tentative plan that 
will require certain gadgets I can’t 
buy openly. And I want a small pad- 
lock specially made. But mainly, 1 
want help getting free of Junnabl. 
He has my yacht, but if the booty’s 
what I suspect, I can buy a new 
yacht.” 

Vassun looked interested. “And 
you suspect what?” 

“Well, I happen to know that be- 
fore the Treaty was signed, TSF 
feared it mi^t be drawn into the 
fighting somewhere out here. There 
was a secret cache somewhere, in 
case supplies were cut off. This 
freighter Junnabl has captured could 
not haul much in the way of missiles 
or other heavy weapons. Nor would 
food and such be worth recovering. 
So 1 think it’s fuel. TSF uses a 
synthetic fissionable similar to the 
one you use. You know how much 
that*s worth per poimd. I judge 
this freighter could stow and lift 
five hundred tons. I think there’ll be 
that much, or more.” 

“Ah,” Vassun said, reaching for 
his glass a little quickly. “Yes. And 
what terms have you in mind?” 

“I get onenfourth,” Wend said. 
“You get onenfourth. We load the 
other half aboard the freighter and 
send her back to Earth.’ 

Vassun blinked. “I did not know 



you were such a loyal patriot.” 
Wend held a palm down. “Barth 
wouldn’t miss the whole cargo too 
much. But if we took all of it, TSF 
might feel stung enough to do some- 
thing. Pass rumors around, if noth- 
ing else. If they get half of it back, 
they’ll keep quiet. After all, they 
won’t be anxious to admit trying to 
recover it.” 

Vassun considered slowly, turn- 
ing his tumbler in his long fingers. 
Finally, “You may be right. But if 
there are other things at the cache? 
Munitions?” 

Wend told him, “I’m not interest- 
ed in them, nor is TSF, probably. 
You can help yourself. Now, here’s 
how I hope to get the secret orders.” 
Wend outlined his plan briefly and 
described certain gadgets he needed. 
“If you’ll have those ready, I can 
pick them up when I land again, in 
uniform, to pull off the switch. 
Then, as soon as I know what the or- 
ders are. I’ll get word to you where 
you can find us — Junnabl and 
me, I mean. I’ll devise some way to 
make myself expendable for that 
long. I can’t plan in detail until I 
see the orders, which I’ll do before 
I take them to him. Do you follow 
me?” 

Vassun considered briefly. “Yes.” 
“Fine, then.” Wend got up. “I 
don’t want to be a hasty guest, but 
Junnabl will be furious that I’ve 
dropped out of sight this long. Will 
you excuse me?” 

“Of course.” Vassun stood up and 
held out his hand, in the Terran ges- 
ture. “One question that has inter- 
ested me, if you will permit?” 

“Of course.”

IF 




“Why do you have the nickname 

you do?” 

“‘Taintless?’ Oh, it goes back to 
my court-martial. My defense at- 
torney got carried away and used 
the word. It was so inapplicable to 
me, everybody laughed. And it 
stuck.” 

Vassun smiled. “Ah. Forgive my 
curiosity.” He waited for Wend to 
unbolt the door. 

J unnabl did a poor job of hiding 
his rage. “Wass a very long 
look, Terranl” 

Wend tried to look injured. “Well, 
naturally I did more than stroll by! 
I made inquiries around to^. 
There’s no Night Duty Officer just 
one enlisted guard. I can handle 
him, and I’ve got a plan. I’ll need 
Waldron’s dispatch case and his 
luggage. You’ll have to land me in 
a shuttleboat and stay in orbit, 
giving a false ship’s name so I can 
say I’m traveling on verbal orders, 
via available transportation. What I 
intend to do is switch dispatch 
cases.” 

A slight muddiness suffused Jun- 
nabl’s face. “Iss not likely they 
will be that easy to fool!” 

Wend told him, “There’s a way 
to manage it. But you’ll have to be 
ready to pick me up fast when I 
walk out of the place.” 

Ill 

T he Senior Lieutenant on Norp 
was eager to talk. “Is something 
up. Commander? We’ve got . 
we’ve heard rumors, but they’re 
vague. Will the Treaty blow up?” 

THE FORTUNES OF PEACE 



Wend (who was calling himself 
Shea) grinned at him. “No. You’d 
have to go out of the Lenj sector 
to find any real fighting, and we’re 
not involv^ in any way. All I know 
is I’m supposed to wait here for 
a ship and further orders.” He set 
Waldron’s dispatch case on the 
corner of the Lieutenant’s desk. 
“Can you lock this up somewhere 
while I go look for a hotel?” 

“Of course. Commander. I’ll put 
it in the safe. If you like, sir, we 
can phone for hotel reservations.” 
Wend grinned again. “Thanks, 
but I’d just as soon look around a 
little. I’ve built up quite a thirst. 
I’ll send for my luggage.” He moved 
the two bags closer to the wall, 
started for the front door, then 
paused. “Will the Night Duty Offi- 
cer be able to get me that dispatch 
case? There’s a lot of stuff in it 
I^m supposed to be studying.” 

The Lieutenant looked 'guilty. “We 
don’t have a Duty Officer at night, 
sir.” He glanced at the safe in the 
rear of the office. “I’ll leave the 
combination with the guard. He’s 
reliable.” 

Wend nodded. “Thanks. Maybe 
I’ll see you around town tonight.” 

N orp’s orange sun had set when 
Wend returned to the office, 
nervous about what lay ahead but 
glad to have the long afternoon 
over. The office lights were already 
on. He wiped his palms on a hand- 
kerchief and entered. 

The guard was sergeant. Cate- 
gory M. P. That wasn’t too good. 
He stood up. “Yes, sir. Commander 
Shea?”

Wend nodded. “They didn’t tell 
me it was so hot here. I hope it 
cools off at night.” 

“It does, sir, if the breeze is 
right. Did you find an air-condi- 
tioned hotelf ’ 

“Yes, finally.” Wend glanced to- 
ward the safe. “I left a dispatch 
case.” 

“Yes, sir. I’ll get it.” 

Wend followed the man as casu- 
ally as he could. He had to be close 
enough to use the small gas-gun 
Vassun Garka had gotten him. He 
put a hand in his pocket, ready to 
draw the weapon. The M.P. knelt 
and worked at the safe dial. It 
seemed a long time before he pulled 
the door open. Wend took one step 
nearer. He drew the weapon, aimed 
it and pressed the stud, clearing his 
throat to camouflage the faint ihiss. 
He must hold his own breath now. 
He saw the faint mist billow out, dis- 
persing quickly. The M.P. had 

Waldron’s dispatch case out now, 
was about to swing the safe shut. 
Wend said abruptly, “Sergeant, my 
luggage ...” 

The kneeling man turned his 

head. He started to say something, 
then looked puzzled. “Your. .” 
Wend stepped closer. “What’s the 
matter? You look sick!” 

The man swayed; put a hand on 
the floor to steady himself. Belated- 
ly, suspicion flooded his face. He 
made an awkward move toward his 
holster; changed his mind and 

reached to shove at the safe-door. 
Wend thrust a foot in the way. He 
had his fist doubled, but the gas 
was swift. The M.P. toppled, pawed 
at the floor and lay still. He’d sleep 
T4 



for hours, Vassun had promised, 
and awake with a temporary am- 
nesia. Wend readied into the safe, 
seized the dispatch dase, tossed 
Waldron’s in, slammed the door 
and gave the dial a spin, then hur- 
ried with the other dispatch case to 
the desk that held the typewriter. 

There was a regulation small pad- 
lock on the case. He drew from his 
hip pocket a pair of cutters — an- 
other of Vassun’s contributions — 
and cut the link. He glanced at the 
door, then opened the case. 

H e re-read the meat of the or- 
ders: “Proceed to given co-or- 
dpates and make sure there is no 
pursuit before approaching the plan- 
et. At specified latitude and longi- 
tude, fly a search pattern, using 
ship’s metal^etector to locate the 
cache. Approximately ten -feet of 
soil and loose rock must be re- 
moved.” 

He studied the description of the 
planet. A lifeless, uninviting one, 
and not handy to anywhere. He 
memorized all figures, then found 
the office’s disposal-slot and thrust 
into it the orders, the gas-gun, the 
cut padlock and the cutters. 

He looked for TSF stationery 
without a local address, found it, 
added carbon paper and a second 
sheet, rolled the whole into the type- 
writer and sat frowning anxiously. 
He had to make decisions fast. Did 
he want to tell Garka the true loca- 
tion of the cache? He thought not. 
The Garkas weren’t cutthroats — 
not ordinary — but they were ca- 
pable of seizing the loot and ponder- 
ing the agreement later. 



IP 




Inspiration came. He glanced at 
the door and at the inert man near 
the safe, then, laboriously, with 
muttered curses, began to type. 

When he’d finished, the fake or- 
ders read, in part, “You will identify 
yourself before landing, then pre- 
sent these orders to the garrison 
Commander.” 

The co-ordinates he gave were 
not those of the cache planet. He 
hoped — this was one of his risks 
— that they wouldn’t be familiar 
to Junnabl. They were the co-or- 
dinates of the uncatalogued, little 
known star called Hane. 

He addressed the envelope to 
Garka Imports, put a copy of the 
faked orders in it and went to 
drop it in the mail-slot. Then he 
looked hastily around the office to 
make sure he’d left no evidence. 
He hurried to the unconscious guard, 
dragged him to the Duty Desk and 
arranged him on the floor as if he’d 
fainted and fallen from his chair. 
Finally he put the faked orders in 
the dispatch case and locked that 
with the special two-key padlock 
Vassun had gotten made for him. 

As he stepped from the office 
with the case under his arm, an air- 
taxi swooped down for him. 

J unnabl, a flat key gripped be- 
tween long thumb and forefin- 
ger, looked up from the dispatch 
case with a scowl. “What iss this?” 
Wend glanced at the two-key 
padlock. It’s a common security 
device in TSF,” he lied. “I suppose 
the C.O. on Norp has the second 
key. I had no chance to find out for 
sure.” 



Junnabl stared at him coldly for 
a moment, then, in an angry mo- 
tion, drew a rupter and blasted the 
padlock. Wend ducked to avoid 
splattering metal. The Kyshan 
jerked the case open and reached 
greedily for the thin envelope in- 
side. He tore that open, unfolded 
the orders and began to read, si- 
lently but with lip-movement, hold- 
ing the document so Wend couldn’t 
see it. His face muddied. He darted 
a look at Wend, then went back to 
the orders. 

Wend could tell when the alien 
reached the end and started through. 
He could tell when Junnabl began 
to repeat the space co-ordinates to 
himself. 

Suddenly the pirate stiffened. 
His eyes went wide, then narrowed. 
The loanee he threw at Wend was 
half-absent. 

God, Wend thought, with a sud- 
den knot in his middle. He recog- 
nizes those co-ordinates! 

After a minute Junnabl looked at 
him again. “I can not pay you off 
yet.” 

Wend tried to act surprised and 
angry. “What do you mean? I’ve 
done my part of the jobi” 

The pirate’s teeth showed. ‘Tss 
other part of job. And iss something 
strange. You will come with me. 
But you will not enter control room 
during trip.” He gestured for a 
guard. 

Wend protested a little, but went 
with the hard-^faced crewman. As 
he left the patrol room, he heard 
Junnabl placing a ship-to-planet ra- 
dio call. 

The call was to Garka Imports. 



THE FORTUNES OF PEACE 



15 




IV 



T he trip would take a little more 
tlian a hundred hours, assuming 
Junnabl went direct to Hane. All 
W^d knew was that the frei^ter 
was in acceleration and would be 
ready to Translocate in a few hours. 

He could only guess what Jun- 
nabl had said to Garka, or what 
Garka’s reaction was to the call. 
Garka might have let something slip. 

Not that Junnabl needed any 
more alerting. Wend’s impulsive use 
of Hane as an ambush point had 
been a bad misstep. At the best, 
Junnabl iknew the Garkas were in- 
volved somehow. Very few people 
knew where Hane was — the star 
was rather isolated, with only one 
livable planet — but obviously Jun- 
nabl knew. And he’d be wondering 
hard how it was that a TSF garri- 
son should exist there. He’d assume 
there was some deal between TSF 
and the Garkas. 

What made it especially galling 
was that Vassun wouldn’t get the 
envelope Wend had mailed him un- 
til hours after Junnabl’s call. 

Then, too, there was the chance 
that someone at the TSF office just 
might sort through the outgoing 
mail and wonder what business they 
had with Garka Imports. 

And just in case Wend ran out of 
things to worry £dK>ut, there was 
something peculiar about Hane it- 
self, or the area around it. The time 
he’d been there, he’d been piloted 
in by a Loob Garka henchman. 
Ships, he knew, had on occasion 
blundered into something fatal near 
Hane; and the Garkas might just 
be angry enou^ to let Junnabl do 
likewise. 



W end spent most of the trip in 
his cubicle — the one that 
had belonged to Commander Wal- 
dron. When he did wander about 
the ship, there was always at least 
one Kyshan guard with him and 
others within call. They let him visit 
most parts of the ship, but made it 
plain he was to touch nothing. He 
stayed alert for any chance to over- 
power a guard or seize a weapon, 
but these weren’t amateurs. The 
deep-phested, stocky Kysh moved 
like cats and were as re^y as cats, 
and they knew how much distance 
to keep between him and them- 
selves. Unless he got an unexpect- 
ed break, he’d have to play out the 
hand he’d dealt himself. 

The freighter was in Transloca- 
tion now, flashing througih some 
limbo that only abtruse mathematics 
could describe. Wend had no way 
of knowing for sure they were 
headed for Hane. When he asked 
Junnabl their destination, it was on- 
ly to maintain his pose of co-opera- 
tion. Junnabl told him nothing. 

He wondered about Junnabl’s flo- 
tilla. No doubt it would be some- 
where handy if needed. 

The hours crawled by, and he be- 
gan to watch his (tonometer. 
Hane, if that is where they were 
headed, shouldn’t be far now. 

Then — at about the right time — 
he heard the sounds and felt the vi- 
brations that meant they’d popped 
into normal space again. The ship’s 
artificial gravity shifted and wav- 
ered, trying to fit itself to decelera- 
tion, and finally succeeded. And 

IF 



16 




now Wend was herded to his cubicle 
and told to stay there. 

He sat on the bunk listening to 
the sounds of the ship. Work was 
going on somewhere — repairs or 
alterations to the machinery. 

Presently he felt a jar. Something 
— a shuttleboat, maybe — had 
coupled on. Shortly after that, there 
were complex maneuvers. He could 
not tell what was going on, but 
they might be matching orbits with 
something. Were they in orbit 
around Hane? If so, where was 
Loob Garka? 

There was another mild jar — 
the shuttleboat was pushing off, 
perhaps. Then silence. The gravity, 
at about one-third G, was steady. 
He listened. The air-conditioners 
hummed. And what was that other 
sound? A generator, to keep the 
ship’s minor machinery running. 
But the drive was silent. 

So they were in oibit somewhere, 
or drifting free. 

They? He hadn’t heard a sound 
since the shuttleboat’s departure to 
indicate anyone but himself aboard. 

He was on his feet swiftly, senses 
taut. He tried the door and found 
it unlocked, saw no guard in the 
corridor. He ran toward the cen- 
tral well; found only dim standby 
lights on. He turned on full light- 
ing, hauled himself up the ladder to 
the control room, flipped switches 
and studied instruments. 

The main computer was dead. 
So were the drive and, of course, 
the radio. He wasn’t going any- 
where, and he wasn’t going to c^ 
help. But the artificial gravity re- 
mained at a third-G, and the view- 

THE FORTUNES OF PEACE 



screens were working. He turned on 
the main one. 

T he brilliaht star that crawled 
across the screen could be 
Hane, twenty or thirty million miles 
away. That it crawled as it did 
meant the ship had a slow end-over- 
end tumble. He began increasing 
magnification, and cranking the 
view to follow the star. 

A dimly lit oblong blob caught 
his eye. That was another ship 
within a few miles of him, faintly 
illuminated by Hane’s distant light. 
He could see she was a derelict, 
holed in more than one place. 
Watching her, he suddenly realized 
that she, and his own ship, were in 
orbit about something. 

He started to look for that, but 
before he found it he saw other 
ships — dozens of them — all ap- 
parently unmanned, many of them 
damag^, swinging in parking or- 
bits. The orbits were fantastically 
quick. His own wasn’t much over 
five minutes. They averaged, he’d 
guess, four or five hundred miles in 
radius. “God,” he muttered, “what 
kind of gravity-monster. ...” 

It took him half an hour to spot 
it, and then he saw no disk — just 
an odd localized distortion of the 
light from distant stars. Something 
too small to see had a gravity suf- 
ficient to hold these ships in their 
tight orbits. 

Had they gotten caught by acci- 
dent? Hardly. The orbits were pre- 
cisely circular, obvioudy planned. 
This must be Loob Garka’s junk- 
pile, where he hid captured ships — 
too far from Hane to reflect mucli 



17 




light, close enough to be reached in 
a burry. 

And Junnabl knew about it. 
Wend saw the Ky^ian’s audacity 
now. He’d bidden Wend bere 
where Loob would least suspect, 
while Junnabl went to negotiate 
with Loob. At least, that meant 
Junnabl hadn’t mentioned Wend to 
either Vassun or Loob. Message- 
drones would have undoubtedly 
flashed between Vassun and Loob 
long before now. 

[But what was this monstrous 
gravity-well? It could only be a 
chunk of nuclear matter — a “>bone” 
of some dead star, perhaips — of 
fantastic density. No wonder it didn’t 
reflect Hane’s light. Its sinface 
gravity was too high! 

So Hane had a companion — a 
dark, secret, dwarf-monster. Think- 
ing back over bits of gossip he’d 
beard, stories of what had befallen 
wandering ships, he could under- 
stand. He wondered if, in fact, 
there weren’t a number of tiny black 
dwarfs aroimd Hane. It would take 
a multiple system to explain some of 
the stories. 

God help a ship that, approaching 
normally in the plane of the visible 
star’s planets, blundered too close 
to one of these things! Tidal forces 
alone could destroy her. 

Well, he was safe here for the mo- 
ment. He got up to make a quick 
tour of the ship, to see what they’d 
left him. 



T ds freighter 
her name — 



Wargentin was 
was, overall, a 



squat cylinder about as long as 
she was wide. Amidships, halfway 



between the flat ends and parallel 
with them, was the circular Main 
Deck, nearly ten feet thick, which 
contained among other t hing s the 
artificial gravity machinery. Within 
the ship it didn’t behave entirely 
like natural, mass-induced gravity. 
It focused in (or, more precisely, 
“drew from”) opposite directions 
toward the main deck, so that it 
was reversed in the two halves of 
the ship. The focusing made the pull 
in the control room^ sixty feet for- 
ward, virtually as strong as at the 
deck itself. Farther away — outside 
the ship — the force reverted, by 
degrees, to the natural laws, includ- 
ing the inverse-square one, and pull- 
ed centripetally toward the ship from 
all directions. 

Forward of the main deck were 
the living quarters and various oth- 
er things, arranged radially around 
the centrd well. Gravity forward was 
usually kept atjone-third G. Aft, the 
reverse-direction gravity might be 
low, just enough to hold loose cargo 
“down,” or magjht be turned off en- 
tirely. Machinery and nonliquid 
storage were mostly aft. 

Wend went down the central well, 
looking in various compartments. 
He reached the central hatch and 
went on through the deck — care- 
fully, because the abrupt change in 
gravity could mess up reflexes. He 
found only standby li^ts beyond, 
and about a twentieth-G. 

Half an hour later he started 
back to the control room. There 
was no better weapon aboard than 
a kitchen knife. Small but neces- 
sary parts of the drive were gone. 
The ship would stay livable for a 

IB 



IB 




long time. But she was parked, un- 
til the drive components were put 
back. 

He checked and found that 
they’d left all of it. So, then, they 
had transferred to Junnabl’s ships. 

It wasn’t quite true that he was 
confirmed here. The two standard 
s^cesuits were in place and in 
working condition. If he preferred, 
he could put one on and go out to 
die in space. 

H e paced the control room. 

“Damn iti With all this ma- 
chinery ...” He forced himself 
to sit down and think. 

One thing Junnabl didn’t know 
was the deal he, Wend, had made 
with the Garkas. Therefore, Jun- 
nabl wouldn’t expect him to recog- 
nize Hane. All of that would change, 
though, as soon as the Kyshan was 
convinced the Garkas knew 
nothing of any TSF base. That 
would prove that Wend had tam- 
pered with the orders, and the whole 
thing would come clear, and Jun- 
nabl would hurry back for him. 
Probably the Kyshan would Trans- 
locate away to throw off pursuit, 
then sneak back. But that wouldn’t 
take long. 

Wend got out a handkerchief 
and wiped his palms. Risking death 
for a big prize was one thing, but 
being tortured for information, by 
experts, was something else. Jun- 
nabl would break him completely, 
until he was utterly incapable of 
lies. 

He had to communicate with 
Loob Garka, quickly. 

Could he rig a radio of some sort? 

THE FORTUNES OF PEACE 



Sure — to communicate within a 
million miles or so. But it woidd 
take more than a crude q>aik-^p 
transmitter to readi Hane. Anymy, 
transmission that far would take 
many hours. 

Well, he needed a message drone, 
then. He’d already looked to see if 
there were any aboard, but now he 
made another trip, looking every- 
where he might be stowed. Junnabl 
had made sure there weren’t any. 

He went back to the control 
room and stood scowling at the 
viewscreen. What were his chances 
of reaching one of the other ships 
in a spacesuit? About as good as his 
chances of throwing a pebble left- 
handed and hitting a bee in flight 
a hundred feet away. Nevertheless, 
he tracked the closer ones and 
calculated as well as he could with- 
out the computer. The next ship 
out passed within two miles, regu- 
larly. But with relative speeds like 
this, a free jump of two hundred 
yards would be considered risky. 

Still, he didn’t have much to lose. 
At worst, he’d die in the suit and 
frustrate Junnabl. He studied the 
ship. She was Lenjan; a freighter, 
but no longer and slimnier than 
Wargentin. She was holed amid- 
ships, but looked sound otherwise. 
Like all the others, including War- 
gentin, she had just enough end- 
over-end tumble to keep her aligned 
along her orbit. 

The chances of reaching her at 
all were so infinitesimal that odds 
against finding message drones 
aboard her didn’t make much dif- 
ference. 

He swiveled the viewer, waited 

19 




for the next ship down to pass im- 
deir bun and studied her. A Norpan 
freighter. The pass wa^ farther away, 
and the rdative motion igreater, so 
he rqected that alternative. 

If he did make a try for the Lenj 
ship, he’d have to take along some 
bars of fuel. That was one thing 
that wouldn’t be left in a long-park- 
ed ship, and he’d need power for 
lights and to warm up the tiny 
drone and project it, assuming he 
found a drone. So said aloud, ‘'Hell! 
I’m thinking as if I really expected 
to make it out there.” 

Now that he’d decided to try, 
thou^, he couldn’t bear ponder- 
ing any more. He huiried to get one 
of the suits. By the time he lugged it 
to an airlock and went aft for three 
fuel bars in their oannisters and at- 
tached them to the suit, Wargentin 
had made five or six orbits and 
was overtaking the Lenj ship again. 
“Damn! I won’t make it this pass.” 

He’d have to hurry even to get 
ready for the next one. He sat 
down and forced himself to t hink 
everything through. He must, he re- 
alized, turn off Wargentin*s gravity 
so it wouldn’t fight the suit’s feeble 
drive. And he’d better leave early, 
so he wouldn’t overshoot the outer 
orbit and not have time to correct. 

He started toward the suit — then 
stiffened with a sudden thought. 

Gravity. 

These parked ships didn’t drift 
together, over any ordinary period 
ei time, because their masses were 
insignificant. But Wargentin had 
gravity — and he could turn it up, 
fore and aft! Why couldn’t he use it 
to pull two ^ps together? 

20 



Excited, he looked at his chro- 
nometer. Nine hours since Junnabl 
h^ left. How soon would he be 
back? It would take many passes 
to bring the orbits together. At the 
present distance, the pull would be 
only a fraction of a G. Did he have 
time? Would it work at all? He 
didn’t see why not. 

He reached for the contrds, 
cranked the viewer around. A quar- 
ter-Jhour to the next pass. “Relax,” 
he growled. “You’ve got a long joib 
ahead of you.” 

He made sandwiches and coffee, 
gulped them down, then paced the 
compartment. Wargentin gradually 
gained on the other ship. Finally he 
sat down, turned up the gravity to 
a full two G’s and let the pressure 
shove him into the chair. He stared 
at the screen, though he knew 
there’d be no visible response in 
the first pass. He’d been in ti^t 
spots, situations where he more than 
half expected to die within minutes. 
None of those times, he thought, 
were worse than this enforced 
waiting. 

But by the fourth pass, the Lenj 
ship’s image was bigger on the 
screen. And somehow the time came 
when he turned off all gravity, 
suited up and went outside. 

V 

T he Lenj ship seemed to creep 
slowly toward him. Instinct 
said, “Now!” 

He turned on the suit’s drive, 
felt the bootsoles press against his 
braced feet, saw Wargentin drop 
from beneath him. Straight out, he 

IF 





THE FORTUNES OF PEACE 



21 




drove — that was the first thing; 
get out there in plenty of time. 
Hane was behind hlin now, and all 
he saw was the Lenj ship, against a 
starfield, seeming to grow and to tilt 
slowly so the stem pointed at him 
like a cannon coming to bear. His 
breath was harsh and rapid in his 
earphones. Was he going to over- 
shoot? He turned off the drive; 
stabbed a finger at an auxiliary 
control to turn him head-on; saw 
that he wasn’t badly out of line. 
Strange, he thought, how that mon- 
strous gravity he couldn’t even feel 
checked his outward drift like a 
chain. He was in the ship’s orbit, 
now, following her at equal veloci- 
ty. Hane swung into view ahead. 
He aligned hteelf just ibelow the 
ship and toward the side where she 
was holed and (touched his drive 
lightly. A minor correction took 
him within yards of the jagged 
wound. He maneuvered to face it 
and used a back-thrast very ginger- 
ly. He didn’t want to gash the 
suit’s plastic on some metal thorn. 

He got in safely, his suit li^ts 
making weird shadows in the wreck- 
ed compartment. A hatch, leading 
inward, gaped open, too bent to be 
closed. But beyond the next com- 
partment was a sound hatch. Once 
through that, he was in the ship’s 
core, hauling himself along very 
slowly because the heavy fuel-can- 
sisters attached to his suit must be 
coaxed, not jerked. 

He knew where the converter- 
room would be and found it. Some 
of the markings he couldn’t de- 
cipher, but the two charging ports 
were unmistakable. He moved to 



them, got into the right position 
and turned on his suit’s footing- 
drive to push his bootsoles against 
the deck. Anchored, he worked 
clumsily at the port covers until 
he got them hinged open. Now he 
detached a cannister from his suit, 
muttering profane thanks to Earth 
for adopting standard-size fuel bars, 
wrestled the cannister into position 
so it hung top-down before him. 
He unscrewed the top, then gave 
the cannister a sharp upward tug. 
It slid free, leaving the heavy bar 
suspended. He maneuvered that in- 
to the port and, holding himself 
down with one hand, shoved hard 
at the bar. It moved sluggishly (but 
with mass I) into the tube. Though 
his gloves, he felt the jolts as it 
tripped the mechanical starters, 
bringing standby batteries to life. 
He stood anxiously by watching a 
panel until a tiny light came on. He 
let out his breath in relief. The ship 
had power now, whatever else she 
might lack. He put the second bar 
in its port, leaving the third in a 
rack. “Didn’t need a spare after 
all.” He started for the control 
room. 

H e flipped master switches and 
studied telltale lights. The drive 
wasn’t in working order, of course 
— they’d have seen to that, after 
parking the ship here. There was no 
stored air, so he’d have to stay in 
his suit. And the main computer 
wasn’t working. That latter was bad; 
he couldn’t compute the distance to 
Hane. He’d have to guess and send 
several drones (if there were any!) 
set for various distances and hope 

IF 



22 




one would space-in fairly close. 

He studied the console lights, 
frowning over the alien symbols. 
That small bank of lights just might 
be. He looked around, saw sev- 
eral closed doors, clumped over to 
one and opened it. Empty — a suit- 
storage locker. He tri^ another. 
This was the communications cub- 
byhole. He turned on lights. Yes! 
Iliose five small ports would be 
tubes leading to the drone-launching 
turret! Shakily, he opened one of 
the ports — and saw the blunt end 
of a message drone. He released a 
catch and drew it out. It was about 
a foot long and three inches thick, 
with a bulge at the middle. The 
drive would be there, at the center 
of gravity. He peered at setscrews 
mentally translating the Lenj cali- 
brations into miles. Well .... He 
checked the other four ports; found 
drones in them. He’d send dl five, 
set for distances ranging from twen- 
ty to thirty billion miles. If the 
planet didn’t happen to be on the 
far side of Hane. 

He made the settings, locked all 
the port-covers and studied the 
controls again before doing any- 
thing. He ought to let the drones 
warm a while longer, anyway. Now 
— how did he feed his message in? 
That phone-jack might be where a 
microphone plugged in — but where 
was the mike? Hastily, clumsily, he 
began to search. None here. He fum- 
bled at his suit; unreeled its exten- 
sion cord; tried the plug. It didn’t 
fit the alien jack. He clumped out 
to the main console, foxmd no 
mikes. He went back and hauled a 
drone out of its nest. Was there a 

THE FORTUNES OF PEACE 



panel that he could hold against the 
voice-vibrator of his suit helmet? 
No. These drones had to be fed 
their messages electronically. He 
swore and slammed the thing back 
into its port. Well, they’d space- 
in and send out their carrier-waves, 
and just possibly Loob Garka 
might hear one of them and make 
the right guesses. He stood in the 
doorway of the cubbyhole, waiting 
for Hane to swing into view on the 
main screen, then pressed the stud 
that sent the drones to the turret. 

A needle flickered on a dial. He 
stared at it in dismay — he didn’t 
have to read the alien symbols to 
know what it meant. A ship had 
spaced-in somewhat close. 

Junnabl. 

He waited tensely for the Hane to 
come into position, dead ahead, 
then stabbed at the firing-stud. He 
couldn’t feel any jar, of course, as 
the tiny drones leaped away, but 
five lights blinked on a panel. Bar- 
ring malfunction, they were locked 
on Hane now. They’d keep them- 
selves aligned and Translocate as 
soon as they had velocity. He hoped 
their drives were strong enough to 
overcome the monstrous gravity be- 
hind them. 

He’d done all he could. He went 
to the viewer, cranked it to find 
Wargentin, saw Junnabl’s flagship 
nestled alongside her. So the pirate 
knew by now that Wend was gone, 
or would, after a hasty search of 
the ship. And as soon as the next 
pass near this Lenj ship, the whole 
thing would be obvious. 

Wend could, of course, slip out 
and, try to hide in space, but Jun- 

23 




n^bl’s radar would spot him at once. 
He might as well wait here. He be- 
gan thinMng what he’d do when 
they came. 

A nother two hours had fretted by. 

His suit air reeked of perspira- 
tion. A shuttleboat, with t^o suited 
figures riding piggyback, was com- 
ing cautiously toward the Lenj ship. 

Wend waited, peering out one 
edge of the jagged hole. Gripped in 
his right hand was the third fuel-bar 
— as good a club as he’d been able 
to find, if unwieldly. The two suits 
detached themselves from the boat 
and dosed in, separating, cautiously. 
Wend drew back to one side to 
avoid a flashlight that searched in- 
to the hole. Gripping a handhold 
with his left hand, he got ready to 
swing the fuel bar with his right. 

Time passed, and the temptation 
was tremendous to peek out; but 
he resisted it. Finally the flashlight 
beam stabbed in at a sharp angle 
and wobbled around the wrecked 
compartment. He got the fuel-bar 
moving very slowly. The flashlight 
itself poked into the hole, and a mo- 
ment later a suit blocked out the 
stars. He strained hard at the bar. 
With painful slowness, it swung 
around; threatened to tear itself 
from his gloved hand, so that he had 
to pull at it very hard. The flash- 
light beam caught it. The suited pi- 
rate went motionless, then, realiz- 
ing the significance of the slow-mo- 
tion swing, tried frantically to 
dodge. But the heavy bar moved on 
ponderously, sweeping him back out 
of the hole, sending him in a head- 
over-heels tumble. Wend was al- 



ready moving. He launched himself 
out after the tumbling figure. The 
flashlight was ginning away use- 
lessly; so was whatever weapon the 
pirate had held. Wend reached him, 
got behind him, waited until the bal- 
ance was right and gave him a 
shove that sent the pirate spinning 
anew and Wend shooting feet-first 
to one side. A rupter beam slashed 
across the ship’s hxill, spilling in- 
candescence in a shower. Wend was 
already curving up and around the 
hull, working frantically at his drive- 
controls to keep aligned. Another 
rupter beam missed him narrowly, 
then he was beyond the hull. He 
took quick evasive action, straining 
the suit’s drive to ,push him out- 
ward, careful not to move retro- 
grade to the ship because that would 
mean being pulled down toward the 
small dark gravity-monster. He got 
turned so he could see back. The 
shuttleboat was in sight, waiting for 
the two suited men to reach it. Jun- 
nabl’s ship was headed this way. 
The suit radio was a clamor of 
harsh Kyshan oaths. Soon the radar 
would find him. Well, he thought 
savagely, 1 gave it a try. And Vm 
not going to let them take me alive. 
Junnabl will never know where that 
cache is! 

But Junnabl — Wend saw pres- 
ently — had other problems. 

Missiles, ghostly in Hane’s dis- 
tant light, were streaking toward 
the pirate ship. It fou^t them off 
desperately with counter-missiles 
while it leaped into acceleration, out 
of orbit and away. More missiles 
pursued. But Junnabl, Wend could 
see, would get velocity enough to 

IF 



24 




Translocate before ever being hit. 

Smaller missiles came after the 
shuttleboat. It veered ifrantically, 
away from them. Wend gasped, 
“God! Not retrograde!” But already 
the boat, orbital speed lost, was 
spiralling down, its drive vastly 
overworked trying to fight that 
gravity. It wouldn’t go all the way 
in, of course. But the tidal forces — 

H e turned on his suit transmitter, 
then waited to get his voice 
under control. “Loob Garka? This 
is Taintless Wend. Do you hear me.” 
It took them minutes to make a 
transmission on his wavelength. 
“Wend? This is Loob Garka. I have 
a fix on you. Whai in hell are you 
doing? Trying to hijack one of my 
ships?” 

Wend’s chuckle was shaky. “I 
was just guarding her for you. Evi- 
dently one of those message drones 
was close enough.” 

Loob said amusedly, “You need 
not have wasted so many. Don’t 
you think I have listening devices 
out around Hane? But you’re 
lucky they were Lenj drones. That 
was the only thing that told me 
where they’d come from!” 

VI 

T he cache hadn’t been hard to 
find, and no harder to dig up. 
Wend sat with Loob and with Vas- 
sun Garka, who was newly arrived 
from Norp. Wend asked the latter, 
“What did Junnabl say when he 
called you?” 

Vassun showed his teeth. “He 
said he had a contract with TSF to 



pick up cargo for them. He didn’t 
mention you. I was startled, at first. 
But when I got your letter, I under- 
stood. Now, about this division — ” 

Loob interrupted, “It was a thing 
I don’t like, your giving him Hane 
co-ordinates. I do not see that we 
are obligated to keep the agree- 
ment.” 

Vassun said, “We’ll give you 
your fourth, but considering events 
I’m inclined to agree with Loob 
about the rest. Can you tell me any 
reason, other than you already have, 
why we should send half back to 
Terra?” 

Wend tried to lie casually. “Well, 
no. Except that the letter I sent you 
wasn’t the only one I sent.” 

Vassun considered, looking almost 
pleased. “Ah. And if you are not 
free to intercept it within a certain 
time, someone will open it, yes? 
But you could be bluffing.” 

Loob took a healthy swig of the 
refreshments and grinned. “I like a 
good bluff. And this Earthman is a 
valuable acquaintance. Let us keep 
the agreement.” 

Wend said, “Fine. And you’ll 
make an additional profit buying 
my fourth from me at your usual 
scandalous rates. I won’t find it con- 
venient stuff to peddle around my- 
self. I’ll have to ran, and fix up a 
new alias, since Junnabl’s still alive 
to talk.” 

Loob veered at Vassun. “You 
see?” Then he peered at Wend. “I 
understand you have lost your 
yacht. Now I happen to have on 
hand a fine small ship, a rebuilt mili- 
tary scout. I will sell it to you at a 
very reasonable price.” END

IF * Short Story 



BRIDE NINETY- ONE 

by ROBERT SILVERBERG 



She was a typical blushing 
bride — though she blushed 
into the far ultravioletl 



I t 'Was a standard six-month mar- 
riage contract. 1 signed it, and 
Landy signed it, and we were man 
and wife, for the time being. The 
registrar clicked and ohnttered and 
disgorged our license. My friends 
grinned and slapped me on the back 
and bellowed congratulations. Five 
of Tandy’s sisters giggled and 
hummed and went through complete 
spectral changes. We were all very 
happy. 

“Kiss the bride!” cried my friends 
and her sisters. 

Landy slipped into my arms. It 
was a good fit; she was pliable and 
slender, and I engulfed her, and the 
petals of her ingestion-slot fluttered 
prettily as I pressed my lips against 
them. We held *the pose for maybe 
half a minute. Give her credit; she 
didn’t flinch. On Tandy’s world they 
don’t kiss, not with their mouths. 



at least; and I doubt that she enjoyed 
the experience much. But by the 
terms of our marriage conitraot we 
were following Terran mores. That 
has to be decided in advance, in 
these interworld marriages. And 
here we kiss the bride; so 1 kissed 
the bride. My pal Jim Owens got 
carried away and scooped up one of 
Tandy’s sisters and Idked her. She 
gave him a shove in the chest that 
knocked him across the chapel. It 
wasn’t her wedding, after all. 

The ceremony was over, and we 
had our cake and hallucinogens; 
and about midnight someone said, 
“We ought to give the honeymoon- 
ers some privacy.” 

So they all cleared out, and Landy 
and I started our wedding nigjht. 

W e waited until they were gone. 
Then we took the back exit 



26 



from the chapel and got into a trans- 
port capsule for two, very snug, 
Landy’s sweet molasses fragrance 
pungent in my nostrils, her flexible 
limbs coiled against mine. 

I nudged a stud, and we went 
floating down Harriman Channel at 
three hundred kilometers an hour. 
The eddy currents weren’t bad, and 
we loved the ride. She kissed me 
again; she was learning our ways 
fast. In fifteen minutes we reach^ 
our programmed destination, and 
the capsule took a quick left turn, 
squirted through an access sphincter 
and fastened itself to the puckered 
skin of our hotel. The nose of the 
capsule produced the desirid de- 
gree of irritation; the skin opened, 
and we shot into the building. I 
opened the capsule and helped Lan- 
dy out, inside our room. Her soft 
golden eyes were shimmering with 
merriment and joy. I slapped a pri- 
vacy seal on the wiall-filters. 

“I love you,” she said in more^r-^ 
less Engli^. 

“I love you,” I told her in her 
own language. 

She pouted at me. “This is a Ter- 
ran marriage, remember?” 

“So it is. So it is. Champagne 
and caviar?” 

“Of course.” 

I programmed for it, and the 
snack came rolling out of the storage 
unit, ice-cold and inviting. I popped 
the cork and sprinkled lemon juice 
on the caviar, and we dined. Fish 
eggs and overripe grape juice, noth- 
ing more, I reminded myself. 

After that we activate the peri- 
scope stack and stared up through 
a hundred storeys of hotel at the 



stars. There was a lover’s moon in 
the sky that iiigjht» and also one of 
the cartels had strung a row of beady 
jewels across about twenty degrees 
of arc, as thou^ purely for our 
pleasure. We held hands and watch- 
ed. 

A fter that we dissolved our wed- 
ding clothes. 

And after that we consummated 
our marriage. 

You don’t think I’m going to tell 
you about that, do you? Some things 
are still sacred, even now. If you 
want to find out how to make love 
to a Suvomese, do as 1 did and 
marry one. But I’ll ^ve you a few 
hints about what it’s like. Anatomi- 
cally, it’s homologous to the process 
customary on Terra, so far as the 
relative roles of male and female 
go. That is, man gives, woman re- 
ceives, in essence. But there are dif- 
ferences, of course. Why marry an 
alien, otherwise? 

I confess I was nervous, although 
this was my ninety-first wedding 
night. I had never married a Su- 
vomese before. I hadn’t been to 
bed with one, either, and if you stop 
to reflect a little on Suvomese ethi- 
cal practices you’ll see what a damn- 
fool suggestion that was. I had stud- 
ied a Suvomese marriage manuel, 
but as any adolescent on any world 
quickly realizes, translating words 
and tridim prints into action is trick- 
ier than it seems, the first time. 

Landy was very helpful, though. 
She knew no more about Terran 
males than I did about Suvomese 
females, of course; but she was eager 
to learn and eager to see that I id 



BRIDE NINETY-ONE

all die dghl dungs. So we managed 
esoeOenitly well. There’s a kn^k 
to lit Some men have it, some don’t 
1 do. 

The next morning we breakfasted 
on a sun-washed terrace overlooking 
a turquoise pool of dancing amoe- 
boids, and later in the day we check- 
ed out and capsuled down to the 
spaceport to begin our wedding 
journey. 

“Happy?” I asked my bride. 
“Very,” she said. “You’re my fa- 
vorite husband already.” 

“Were any of the others Ter- 
rans?” 

“No, of course not.” 

I smiled. A husband likes to know 
he’s been the first. 

At the spaceport, Landy signed 
the manifest as Mrs. Paul Clay, 
which gave me great pleasure, and 
I signed beside her, and they scanned 
us and let us go aboard. The ship 
personnel beamed at us in delight. 
A handsome indigo-skinned girl 
showed us to our cabin and wished 
us a good trip so amiably that I 
tried to tip her. I caught her credit- 
counter as she passed me and pushed 
the dial up a notch. She looked 
aghast and set it right back again. 
“Tipping’s forbidden, sirl” 

“Sorry. I got carried away.” 
“Your wife’s so lovely. Is she 
Honirangi?” 

“Suvornese.” 

“I hope you’re very haippy to- 
gether.” 

were alone again. I cuddled 
Landy up against me. Inter- 
world marriages are all the rage 
nowadays, of course; but I hadn’t 



married Landy merely because it 
was a fad. I was genuinely attracted 
to her, and she to me. All over the 
galaxy people are contracting the 
weird^t marriages just to say that 
they’ve done it — marrying Sthenics, 
Gruulers, even Hhinamor. Really 
grotesque couplings. I don’t say that 
the prime purpose of a marriage is 
sex, or that you necessarily have to 
marry a member of a species with 
which a physical relationship is easy 
to maintain. But there ought to be 
some kind of warmth in a marriage. 
How can you feel real love for a 
Hhinamor wife who is actually seven 
pale blue reptiles permanently en- 
closedrrin an argon atmosphere? At 
least Landy was mammalian and 
humanoid. A Suvomese-Terran mat- 
ing would of course be inf^le, but 
I am a conventional sort of person 
at heaiFt and try to avoid committing 
abominaitions; I am quite willing to 
leave the task of continuing the 
species to those whose job is repro- 
duction, and you can be sure that 
even if our chromosomes were 
mutually congruent I would never 
have brought the disgusting subject 
up with Landy. Marriage is marriage, 
reproduction is reproduction, and 
what does one have to do with the 
other, anyway? 

During the six subjective weeks of 
our journey, we amused ourselves 
in various ways aboard the ship. 
We made love a good deal, of course. 
We went gravity-swiniming and play- 
ed paddle-polo in the star lounge. 
We introduced ourselves to other 
newlywed couples and to a newly 
wed super-couple consisting of three 
Banamons and a pair of Ghinoi.

IP 




And also Landy had her teeth 
transplanted, as a special surprise 
for me, 

Suvomese have teeth, but they 
are not like Terran teeth, as why 
should they be? They are elegant 
little spiny needles mounted on ro- 
tating bases, which a Suvornese uses 
to impale his food while he rasps 
at it from the rear with his tongue. 
In terms of Suvomese needs they 
are quite functional, and in the con- 
text of her species Landy’s teeth 
were remarkably attractive, I 
thought. I didn’t want her to change 
them. But she must have picked up 
some subtle hint that I found her 
teeth anti-erotic, or something. Per- 
haps I was rachating an underlying 
dislike for that alien dental arrange- 
ment of hers even while I was telling 
.myself on the conscious level that 
they were lovely. So she went to 
the ship’s surgeon and got herself 
a mouthful of Terran teeth. 

I didn’t know where she went. She 
vanished after breakfast, telling me 
she had something important to at- 
tend to. All in ignorance, I donned 
gills and went for a swim while 
Landy surrendered her pretty teeth 
to the surgeon. He cleaned out the 
sockets and implanted a rooting 
layer of analogous gum^issue. He 
chiseled new receptor sockets in this 
synthetic implant. He drill-tailored 
a set of donor teeth to fit and 
slipped them into the periodontal 
membranes and bonded them with a 
quick jab of homografting cement. 
The entire process took less than 
two hours. When Landy returned to 
me, the band of color-variable skin 
across her forehead was way up 



toward the violet, indicating con- 
siderable emotional disturbmce; and 
I felt a little edgy about it. 

She smiled. She drew back the 
petals of her ingestion-slot. She 
showed me her new teeth. 

4 4 T andy! What the hell — I” 

J— / Before I could check my- 
self, I was registering shock and 
dismay from every pore. And Landy 
registered dismay at my dismay. 
Her forehead shot clear past the 
visible spectrum, bathing me in a lot 
of ultraviolet that distressed me even 
though I couldn’t see it, and her 
petals drooped and her eyes glisten- 
ed and her nostrils clamped togeth- 
er. 

“You don’t like them?” she asked. 

“I didn’t expect — you took me 
my surprise — ” 

“I did it for you!” 

“But I liked your old teeth,” I 
protested, 

“No. Not really. You were afraid 
of them. I know how a Terran kiss- 
es. You never kissed me like that. 
Now I have beautiful teeth. Kiss me, 
Paul.” 

She trembled in my arms. I kissed 
her. 

We were having our first emo- 
tional crisis. She had done this crazy 
thing with her teeth purely to please 
me, and I wasn’t pleased, and now 
she was upset. I did all the things 
I could to soothe her, short of telling 
her to go back and get her old teeth 
again. Somehow that would have 
made matters worse. 

I had a hard time getting used 
to Landy with Terran choppers in 
her dainty little mouth. She had re- 



BRlbE NINETY-ONE 



29 




oeived a flawless set, of course, two 
.^eamnjg ivory rows; but /tihey look- 
ed incongruous in her ingestion slot, 
land I liad to fight to keep from re- 
acting negatively every time she 
opened her mouth. When a man buys 
an old Gothic cathedral, he doesn’t 
want an architect to trick it up with 
wiggling bioplast inserts around the 
spire. And when a man marries a 
Suvomese, he doesn’t want her to 
turn herself piecemeal into a Ter- 
ran. Where would it end? Would 
Landy now decorate herself with a 
synthetic navel and have her breasts 
shifted about and — 

Well, she didn’t. She wore her 
Terran teeth for about ten ship- 
board days, and neither of us took 
any overt notice of them, and then 
very quietly she went back to the 
surgeon and had him give her a 
set of Suvomese dentals again. It 
was only money, I t<dd myself. 1 
didn’t make any reference to the 
switch, hoping to treat die episode 
as a temporary aberration that now 
was ended. Somehow 1 got the feel- 
ing that Landy still thou^ she ought 
to have Terran teeth. But we never 
discussed it, and I was happy to 
see her looking Suvomese again. 

Y ou see how it is, with marriage? 

Two people try to please one 
another, and they don’t always suc- 
ceed, and sometimes they even hurt 
one another in the very attempt to 
please. That’s how it was with Lan- 
dy and me. But we were mature 
enough to survive the great tooth 
crisis. If this had been, say, my 
tenth or eleventh marriage, it might 
have been a disaster. One learns 



how to avoid the pitfalls as one 
gains experience. 

We n^gled a good deal with our 
fellow passengers. If we needed les- 
sons in how not to conduct a mar- 
riage, they were easily available. Ihe 
cabin next to ours was occupied by 
another mixed couple, which was 
excuse enough for us to spend some 
time with them; but very quickly 
we realized that we dito’t relish 
their company. They were both 
playing for a bond forfeiture — a 
very ugly scene, let me tell you. 

The woman was Terran — a big, 
voluptuous sort with orange hair and 
speckled eyeballs. Her name was 
Marje. Her new husband was a 
Lanamorian, a hulking ox of a 
humanoid with cormgated blue skin, 
four telescopic arms and a tripod 
deal for legs. At first they seemed 
likeable enough, both on the flighty 
side, interstellar tourists who had 
been everywhere and done every- 
thing and now were settling down 
for six months of bliss. But very 
shortly I noticed that they spoke 
sharply, even cruelly, to one another 
in front of strangers. They were out 
to wound. 

You know how it is with the six- 
month marriage contract, don’t 
you? Bach party posts a desertion 
bond. If the oier fails to go the 
route and walks out before the 
legal dissolution date, the bond is 
forfeited. Now, it’s not all that hard 
to stay married for six months, and 
the bondsmen rarely have to pay 
off; we are a mature dvilization. 
Such early abuses of the system as 
conspiring to have one party desert, 
and then splitting the forfeiture latw. 




have long ^ce become extinct 

But Marje and her l^namorian 
mate were both hard up ior cash* 
Each was hot for the foiieitore^ and 
each was working like a demon to 
outdo the other in obnoxiousness, 
hoping tto break up the marriage 
fast I saw what Wias going on, 
I suggested to Landy that we look 
for friends elsewhere on the ship. 

Which led to our second emotional 
crisis. 

As part of their campaign of mu- 
tual repulsion, Marje and hubby 
decided to enliven their marriage 
wi'th a spot of infidelity. I take a 
very old-fashioned view of the mar- 
riage vow, you understand. I regard 
myself as bound to love, honor and 
obey for six months, with no fooling 
around on the side; if a man can’t 
stay monogamous t^ugh an entire 
marriage, he ought to get a spine im- 
plant 1 assumed that Landy felt 
the same way. I was wrong. 

W e were in the ship’s lounge, 
the four of us, getting high 
on direct jolts of teel oils and 
stray esters, when Marje made a 
pass at me. She was not subtle. She 
deopaqued her clothes, waved yards 
of bosom in my face and sMd, 
*‘There’s a nice wide bed in our 
cabin, sweetheart.” 

‘^It isn’t bedtime,” I told her. 

“It could be.” 

“No.” 

*1Be a friend in need, Paulsie. 
This monster’s been crawling all over 
me for weeks. I want a Terran to 
love me.” 

**The ship is full of available Ter- 
rans, Marje.” 



“I want you.” 

“I’m not available.” 

“Out it outi You mean to say 
you won’t do a fellow Terran a little 
favor?” She stood up, quivering, bare 
flesh erupting all over the place. In 
scabrously explicit terms she des- 
cribed her intimacies with the 
Lanamorian and begged me to give 
her an hour of more oonventional 
pleasure. I was steadfast. Perhaps, 
she suggested, I would tape a 
simulacrum and send that to her bed? 
No, not even that, I said. 

At length Marje got angry with 
me for turning her down. I suppose 
she could be legitimately annoyed 
at my lack of chivalry, and if I 
hadn’t happened to be married at 
the moment I would ^adly have 
obliged her; but as it was I couldn’t 
do a thing for her, and she was boil- 
ing. She dumped a drink in my face 
and stalked out of the lounge, and 
in a few moments the Lanamorian 
followed her. 

1 looked at Landy, whom I had 
carefully avoided during the whole 
embaiTiassing colloquy. Her fore- 
head was sagging close to infrared, 
which is to say, in effect, that 
was almost in tears. 

“You don’t love me,” she said. 

"Whatr 

“If you loved me you’d have gone 
with her.” 

“Is that some kind of Suvomese 
marriage custom?” 

“Of course not,” she snuffled. 
“We’re married under Terran mores. 
It’s a Terran marriage custom.” 
“What gives you the idea that — ” 
“Terran men are unfaithful to 
their wives. I know. I’ve read about

it. Any husband who cares about his 
wife at all cheats her now and then. 
But you — ” 

“You’ve got things mixed up,” I 
said. 

“I don*t! 1 don*tr And she neared 
tantrum stage. Gently I tried to tell 
her that she had been reading too 
many historical novels, that adul- 
tery was very much out of fashion, 
that by turning Marje down I was 
demonstrating the solidity of my 
love for my wife. Landy wouldn’t 
buy it. She got more and more con- 
fused and angry, huddling into her- 
self and quivering in misery. I con- 
soled her in all the ways I could 
imagine. Gradually she became tran- 
quil again, but she stayed moody. I 
began to see that marrying an alien 
had its complexities. 

T wo days later, Marje’s husband 
made a pass at her. 

I missed the preliminary phases. 
A swarm of energy globes had en- 
ooimtered the ship, and I was up 
lat the view-wall with most of the 
other passengers, watching the grace- 
ful gyrations of these denizens of 
hyperspace. Landy was with me at 
fiist; but she had seen energy globes 
so often that they bored her, and so 
she told me she was going down to 
the scintillation tank for a while, 
as long as everyone was up here. I 
said I’d meet her there later. Even- 
tually I did. There were about a 
dozen beings in the tank, making 
sparkling blue tracks through the 
radiant greenish-gold fluid. I stood 
by the edge, looking for Landy, but 
there was no one of her general 
physique below me. 



And then I saw her. She was nude 
and dripping polychrome fluid, so 
she must have come from the tank 
only a few moments before. The 
hulking Lanamorian was beside her 
and clearly trying to molest her. He 
was pawing her in various ways, and 
Tandy’s spectrum was showing ob- 
vious distress. 

Hubby to the rescue, naturally. 
But I wasn’t needed. 

Do you get from this tale an 
image of Landy as being frail, doll- 
like, something of porcelain? She 
was, you know. Scarcely forty kilo- 
grams of woman there, and not a 
bone in her body as we understand 
bone — merely cartilage. And shy, 
sensitive, easily set aflutter by an un- 
kind word or a misconstrued nuance. 
Altogether in need of husbandly 
protection at all times. Yes? No. 
Sharks, like Suvomese, have only 
gristle in place of bone, but forty 
kilograms of shark do not normally 
require aid in looking after them- 
selves, and neither did Landy. 

Suvomese are agile, well coordin- 
ated, fast-moving and stronger than 
they look, as Jim Owens found out 
at my wedding when he kissed 
Tandy’s sister. The Lanamorian 
found it out, too. Between the time 
I spied him bothering Landy and 
the time I reached her side, she had 
dislocated three of his arms and 
flipped him on his massive back, 
where he lay flexing his tripod sup- 
ports and groaning. Landy, looking 
sleek and pleased with herself, 
kissed me. 

“What happened?” I asked. 

“He made an obscene proposi- 
tion.” .

“You really mined him, Landy.” 

“He made me terribly angry” 
she said, although ^e no longer 
looked or sound^ very angry. 

1 said, “Wiasn’t it just the other 
day that you were telling me 1 didn’t 
love you because I turned down 
Marje’s obscene proposition? You 
aren’t consistent, Landy. If you 
think that infidelity is essential to a 
Terran-mores marriage, you should 
have given in to him, yes?” 

‘Terran husbands are unfaithful. 
Terran wives must be chaste. It is 
known as the double standard.” 

“The what?” 

“The double standard,” she re- 
peated, and she began to explain it 
to me. I listened for a while, then 
started to laugh at her sweetly inno- 
cent words. 

“You’re cute,” I told her. 

“You’re terrible. What kind of a 
woman do you think I am? How 
dare you encourage me to be unfaith- 
ful?” 

“Landy, I — ” 

She didn’t listen. She stomped 
away, and we were having our third 
emotional crisis. Poor Landy was 
determined to run a Terran-mores 
marriage in what she considered the 
proper fashion, and she took bright 
cerise umbrage when I demurred. 
For the rest of the week she was 
cool to me, and even after we had 
made up, t^ngs never seemed quite 
the same as before. A gulf was 
widening between us — or rather, 
the gulf had been there all along, 
and it was becoming harder for us 
to pretend it didn^ exist. 

After six weeks of these annoying 
misunderstandings, we landed. 



O UT destiDaition was Thalia, the 
, honeymoon planet I had spent 
hidf a dozen earlier honeymoons 
there; but Landy had never seen it, 
so 1 had signed up for another visit. 
Thalia, you know, is a good-®zed 
planet, about one and a h^ Earths 
in mass, density and gravitation, 
with a couple of colorful moons that 
might almost have been designed for 
lovers, since they’re visible day and 
night The sky is li^t green, the 
vegetation runs heavily to a high- 
tannin orange-yellow, tod the air 
is as bracing as nutmeg. 

The place is owned by a cartel 
that mines prealloyed me^ on the 
dry northern continent, extracts 
power cores in the eastern lobe of 
what once was a tropical forest land 
is now a giant slab of laterite and, 
on a half-sized continent in the west- 
ern ocean, operates a giant resort for 
newlyweds. It’s more or less of a 
galactic dude ranch; the staff 
is iaregly Terran, and the clientele 
comes &om all over the cosmos. 
You can do wonders with an unin- 
habited habitable planet, if you grab 
it with the right kind of lease. 

Landy and I were still on the 
chilly side when we left the starship 
and were catapulted in a grease- 
flask to our honeymoon cabin. But 
she warmed immediately to the 
charm of the environment. We had 
been placed in a floalting mono- 
molecular balloon, anchored a hun- 
dred meters above the main house. 
It was total isolation, as most honey- 
mooners crave. (I know there are 
exceptions.) 

We worked hard at enjoying our 
stay on Thalia. 



BRIDE NINETY-ONE

We let ourselves be plugged into 
a ptierodactyl kite that itook us on 
a tour of ^e entire continent. We 
sipped rad(>n cocktails at a get-to- 
g^er party. We munched algae 
steaks over a crackling fire. We 
swam. We hunted. We fished. We 
made love. We lolled under the 
friendly sun until my skin grew 
copper-colored and Lady’s turned 
the color of fine oxblood porcelain, 
strictly from Kang-hsi. We had a 
splendid time, despite the spreading 
network of tensions that were com- 
ing to underlie our relationship like 
an interweave of metallic filaments. 

U ntil the bronco got loose, every- 
thing went well. 

It wasn’t exactly a bronco. It was 
a Vesilian quadruped of vast size, 
blue with orange stripes, a thick 
murderous tail, a fierce set of teeth 
— two tons, more or less, of vicious 
wild animal. They kept it in a corral 
back of one of the proton wells, 
and from time to time members of 
the staff dressed up as cowpokes 
and staged impromptu rodeos for the 
guests. It was impossible to break 
the beast, and no one had stayed 
aboard it for more than about ten 
seconds. There had been fatalities, 
and at least one hand had been 
mashed so badly that he couldn’t be 
returned to life; they simply didn’t 
have enough tissue to put into the 
centrifuge. 

Landy was fascinated by the ani- 
mal. Don’t ask me why. She hauled 
me (to the corral whenever an ex- 
hiibiition was announced and stood in 
rapture while the cowpokes were 
whirled around. She was right be- 

34 



side the fence the day the beast 
threw a rider, kicked over the traces, 
ripped free of its handlers and head- 
ed for the wide open spaces. 

“Kill it!” people began to scream. 

But no one was armed except the 
cowpokes, and they were in varying 
stages of disarray and destruction 
that left them incapable of doing 
anything useful. The quadruped 
cleared the corral in a nicely timed 
leap, paused to kick over a sapling, 
bounded a couple of dozen meters 
and halted, pawing the ground and 
wondering what to do next. It looked 
hungry. It looked mean. 

Confronting it were some fifty 
young husbands who, if they wanted 
a chance to show their brides what 
great heroes they were, had the op- 
portunity of a lifetime. They merely 
had to grab a sizzler from one of the 
fallen hands and drill the creature 
before it chewed up the whole hotel. 

There were no candidates for 
heroism. All the husbands ran. Some 
of them grabbed their wives; most 
did not. I was planning to run, too, 
but I’ll say this in my favor: I 
intended to take care of Landy. I 
looked around for her, failed for a 
moment to find her and then ob- 
served her in the vicinity of the 
snorting beast. She seized a rope 
dangling from its haunches and pull- 
ed herself up, planting herself be- 
hind its mane. The beast reared and 
stamped. Landy clung, looking like 
a child on that massive back. She 
slid forward. She touched her in- 
gestion slot to the animal’s skin. I 
visualized dozens of tiny needles 
brushing across that impervious hide. 

The animal neighed more or less. 



IF 




relaxed and meekly trotted back to 
the corral. Landy persuaded it to 
jump over the fence. A moment 
later the startled cowhands, those 
who were able to function, tethered 
the thing securely. Landy descended. 

“When I was a child I rode such 
an animal every day,” she explained 
gravely to me. “I know how to han- 
dle them. They were less fierce than 
they look. And, oh, it was so good 
to be on one again!” 

“Landy,” I said. 

“You look angry.” 

“Landy, that was a crazy thing to 
do. You could have been killed!” 
“Oh, no, not a chance.” Her spec- 
trum began to flicker toward the ex- 
tremes, though. “There was no risk. 
It’s lucky I had my real teeth, 
though, or — ” 

I was close to collapse, a delayed 
reaction. *'Don*t ever do a thing like 
that again, Landy 
Softly she said, “Why are you so 
angry? Oh, yes, I know. Among Ter- 
rans, the wife does not do such 
things. It was the man’s role I played, 
yes? Forgive me? Forgive me?” 

I forgave her. But it took three 
hours of steady talking to work out 
all the complex moral problems of 
the situation. We ended up by agree- ^ 
ing that if the same thing ever hap- 
pened again, Landy would let me 
soothe the beast. 

I t didn’t kill me. I lived through 
the honeymoon and happily ever 
after. The six months elapsed; our 
posted bonds were redeemed, and 
our marriage was automatically 
terminated. Then, the instant we 
were single again, Landy turned to 



me and sweetly uttered the most 
shocking proposal I have ever heard. 

“Marry me again,” she said. 

We do not do such things. Six- 
month liaisons are of their very na- 
ture transient, and when they end, 
they end. I loved Landy dearly, but 
I was shaken by what she had sug- 
gested. However, she explained what 
she had in mind, and I listened with 
growing sympathy, and in the end 
we went before the registrar and exe- 
cuted a new six-month contract. 

But this time we agreed to abide 
by Suvornese and not Terran mores. 
So the two marriages aren’t really 
consecutive in spirit, though they are 
in elapsed time. And Suvornese mar- 
riage is very different from mar- 
riage Terran style. 

How? 

I’ll know more about that a few 
months from now. Landy and I leave 
for Suvoma tomorrow. I have had 
my teeth fixed to please her, and 
it’s quite strange walking around 
with a mouthful of tiny needles, 
but I imagine I’ll adapt. One has to 
put up with little inconveniences in 
'the give-^and-take of marriage. Lan- 
dy’s five sisters are returning to their 
native world with us. Eleven more 
sisters are there already. Under 
Suvornese custom I’m married to all 
seventeen of them at once, regard- 
less of any other affiliations they may 
have contracted. 

So Bride Ninety-one is also Bride 
Ninety-two for me, and there’ll be 
seventeen of her all at once, dainty, 
molasses-flavored, golden-eyed and 
sleek. I’m in no position right now 
to predict what this marriage is go- 
ing to be like. END

The Masters owned us oil, body 
and soul — and what infelligenf 
person would want if otherwise? 



I could not have written this record 
six months ago. Our posterity 
will need it to explain 'both the new 
and evolving species of this planet, 
Ed, as well as the tremendous dis- 
persion of human and alien life 
forms to be found throughout such 
a wide volume of the cosmos. 

I am not a Grammer, yet I am 
telling this story. I am not History, 



yet I will make and form meaning 
as the Histories do. I am a Gene- 
tic. And this means that I was bred 
to be genius in the specialized field 
of basic life components. Where the 
Grammers are genius at communi- 
cations and the Histories are genius 
at putting together the important 
parts of the past, I can put together 
the molecules required to build near- 
ly any life variant which might be 
desired by our Masters. Except for 



events unforeseen by tbe Masters, I 
would be genetically incapable of 
telling this history! 

In the dim past, beyond the norm- 
al scrutiny of the Histories, the 
Master race somehow became a par- 
ty to the engineering of space travel. 
The Histories say that the Masters 
could not have developed space en- 
gineering themselves. Perhaps some 
other form, either common or alien 
to their world of origin, unavoidably 
gave the Master race this tool for 
deep space travel. Subsequently, for 
countless thousands of years the 
Masters spread throughout the stars, 
absorbing all usable life forms into 
their system of vassalage. Now — 
and perhaps always — the Masters 
feel Aat all of space and all of life 
is their proper domain and servant, 
respectively. 

To a Genetic like myself there is 
no mystery as to how and why the 
Master could dominate any life 
form. Each Master has a thin but 
tough integument covered by minute 
specialized organelles spaced in a 
latticelike network. These molecular 
groupings are spaced in a linked re- 
ceiving and sending sensory-system 
network capable of one peculiar 
property of activity. The network 
can perceive (or sense) the basic 
purpose of any living entity con- 
structed of matter. I don’t mean that 
the Masters are mind readers, or 
that they can “tune in” on an in- 
dividual life form and know what 
that individual is going to do the 
next instant Their sensing apparatus 
is far cruder than that. But, in a 
way, the end results are just as spec- 
tacular. Masters know beyond any 



reasonable doubt exactly what each 
individual life is potentially capable 
of doing. Any life group, or individ- 
ual life form, which the Master 
“reads” to have the potential of kill- 
ing a Master is simply killed by the 
Master. Histories tell that even yet, 
at the borders of the Masters’ do- 
main, entities are discovered and 
killed by the trillions. 

In rare instances, the Masters will 
select a relatively undifferentiated 
race such as our human race and 
pass all members before a board of 
selectors. Each individual is screened 
for potential harm to the Master 
race. If the potential is low, that 
individual is retained under strict 
security guard to be used as a breed- 
er. In turn, his or her offspring are 
reviewed by a board. This process 
continues for many generations un- 
til a perfectly satisfactory human has 
been genetically produced. 

Since direct sensory knowledge of 
the genetic purpose of each individ- 
ual is always known to the Master, 
individuals are bred to be loyal and 
to be highly specialized in a useful 
area of service. 

If I were to include a list of the 
chief characteristics to be found in 
the Master race I would not include 
intelligence. Highest on the list 
would be a characteristic of survival. 
Domesticated races of many kinds 
accomplish all of the Master’s work 
— his thinkin g, his exploration, his 
fighting, his invention, his every 
mode of living. The Master’s only 
work consists of screening races or 
individual members of races. Their 
loyal servants do all else. 

We domesticates are incapable of 



38 



IF 




even the thought of disloyalty. 
Would a meat animal, hred for 100 
generations for the traits of docility 
and tender meat, connive and 
scheme toward the day of freedom? 
Perhaps one of its early ancestors 
might have sought freedom. But his 
“freedom” genes have long been 
eliminated from his progeny. So it 
was with each of us, no matter the 
star of our origin. We are incapable 
of disloyal thoughts or actions to- 
ward our Masters. We are capable, 
sometimes unusually so, in the field 
of work for which we were bred. I 
am bred for and trained to be genius 
Genetic! 

II 

M y first memory occurred at the 
age of two. I looked around 
the bright orange cubicle containing 
the usual assortment of human train- 
ing toys when my sight caught and 
clung to the three-dimensional 
chromosomal model. I remember 
thinking that the energy form con- 
taining fifteen energy levels was 
placed in the wrong m^el. I scream- 
ed because I wanted to change its 
position. 

It wasn’t a question of symmetry. 
It was a question of “rightness” and 
my subjective need to restore some- 
thing which was clearly not of na- 
ture. The Mothers, who are usually 
very good about changing wet pants 
and other normal biological needs, 
were just not capable of satisfying 
my difficulty on that day. Ihe 
Mothers had their own speci^ty and 
could not have dreamed that mov- 
ing a phosphorus atom on a three- 



dimensional model would stop a two- 
year-old from screaming. I shall 
never forget that day. It was my un- 
happiest! 

Soon thereafter the Teachers en- 
tered my life. Among the many 
things I learned were certain facts 
of my own life. I was 205th screened 
generation. I was the penultimate of 
many important human lines bred 
to be key research and development 
scientists in the field of genetics. 

Since research in genetics required 
knowledge of all of the sciences, I 
was rigidly instructed in every area. 
But the penalty of being bred with 
such exceptional tdents as mine was 
similar to penalties instrinsic to all 
of the Masters’ vassals. Since I was 
not bred to be Grammer, 1 became 
confused, illogical and poor of mem- 
ory whenever I tried to discuss any 
subject other than my own. Con- 
versely, any subject bordering or 
merely symbolized within my field 
of competence provided a tapestry 
against which my brilliance could 
weave endless diagrams of beauty. 
For that is what I was bred to be 
— genetic genius for the research 
and development of other domesti- 
cates for the Masters. 

My teachers were the experts they 
had been bred to be. They started 
my learning process too early for 
me to say that at such and such a 
date I began my education. Learn- 
ing was a full time awake activity 
for me. I had no way at all of know- 
ing whether my regime was harder 
or easier than any other training 
program — for mine was designed 
solely for me, and I was the only 
pupil within the program. 



TO SERVE THE MASTERS 



39 




I ’ll not forget the day when Teach- 
er of Biologies had progrimmed 
the multisensory learning computer 
for genetics of an advanced nature. 
The course consisted of placing all 
known facts about genetics into the 
computer, along with all of the logi- 
cal relations and functional relations 
which would tie the facts together. 
The student is then asked to simu- 
late experiments by symbolic pro- 
cesses which the computer assesses 
against its tautological structure. If 
the student is wrong, the computer 
is supposed to signal this fact to the 
student as well as to explain the 
error. If the student is right, the 
computer determines all of the im- 
portant ramifications of the simu- 
lated experiment and rewards the 
student by presenting a realistic but 
simulated model of his successful 
experiment in three-dimensional col- 
or vision. 

Now, I had always been curious 
about the structure of organelles 
which could provide an apparatus 
capable of sensing th^ structure and 
function of other organelles. I set 
up my symbolic experiment and 
pushed the appropriate computer 
keys. The logical extrapolation 
which was presented to me in full 
color as my reward for selecting the 
correct postulates and ingredients 
was that of one of the Master race. 

At the same time, the experiment 
“halt” light came on, and the com- 
puter carefully explained to me that 
the experiment was incapable of be- 
ing performed due to my logical in- 
consistencies. From this day I knew 
that the current logical construct of 
heredity was faulty admitting to con- 



flicting conclusions. I knew also 
that 1 had accidentally placed my 
finger on the key difference ibetween 
the Master race and other life forms! 

My education progressed rather 
well, without significant difference 
'between mine and that received by 
other “professional” categories. 
Factual knowledge was easy to ab- 
sorb both by reason of my birth- 
right and because of the chemical 
and mechanical aids to learning. I 
explored the byways and pathways 
of allied fields of knowledge but, 
whenever my life required any form 
of communication outside of genetic 
or genetic related problems, I gen- 
erally depended upon the Gram- 
me. They couldn’t understand, but 
th^ could communicate very well. 

Not until my period of advanced 
training was begun did further im- 
portant knowledge regarding Mas- 
ters come to me. 

m 

T he day I was discharged from 
the Teacher cubicle my ad- 
vanced training began. 

My world had consisted chiefly 
of sleeping, eating and learning. 
Learning consisted of guidance by 
teachers and manipulation of the 
large multisensory learning compu- 
ter. Facts about the outside world 
were known only at second-hand. 
Exposure to the outside world under 
Advanced Training was optional for 
all specialist scientists or engineers. 
If, for example, one were trained 
to study crystal-forming phenome- 
non, there might be no theoretical 
reason for the person to travel out- 



40 



IF 




side of his cubicle. If, however, 
problems of cosmology, no hind- 
rance existed for the scientist to visit 
other planets, solar systems or what- 
ever he pleased. 

I elected, therefore, to continue 
my advanced study through travel. I 
desired to experience at first hand 
the result of changing ecology, to 
deduce at first hand the effect of 
star, gravity, chemical and radiation 
on composite and simple gene struc- 
tures. I desired, too, to satisfy the 
increasingly driving curiosity of my 
maturing intellect. I was now ten 
years old. 

Under the guidance of Teachers, 
with the aid of Grammers, Travel 
Planner specialists laid out my five- 
year itinerary. I was to visit at least 
fourteen stars of class G, M, O and 
A, with twenty-seven different plan- 
ets to sample. 

I closed the door of the Growth 
cubicle with a sense of relief. The 
robotic track car was waiting. I 
jumped inside and pressed the win- 
dow button to anti-polarization so 
that I could view the scenery which 
had so long been denied me in per- 
son. Soon I had to admit that the 
sight of miles of cubelike structures 
without windows or decorations and 
an occasional robotic track car were 
not impressive sensory stimuli. But 
these, nonetheless, together with a 
real sky and sun, inspired me great- 
ly at the time. Subjectively I knew 
that I was maturing and I was glad 
to be alive in the world. 

Perhaps five hours were consumed 
in traveling to the spaceport. Other 
ports were closer, I was told, but 
the ship of my destination was there. 



I grabbed my very small bag of per- 
sonal belongings — a three-dimen- 
sional yellow star representing my 
badge of genetic servitude to the 
Masters and which was given to me 
by the head Teacher when I success- 
fully predicted the proper genetic 
structure of 2000 biological organ- 
isms from a standard list of char- 
acteristics; a portable multisensory, 
multipurpose computer presented me 
on my entrance to Advanced Train- 
ing and a micro-micro<ompater 
tape containing the basic physical 
characteristics of every life form 
above level six that I would expect 
to meet anywhere on a broad locus 
surrounding my trip. I jumped from 
the track car and ran to the space- 
port door. Inside I found the same 
serene environment that I had come 
to expect everywhere in my short 
life. Several humans were standing 
around holding blue or green tags 
which identified their purpose in 
life. The blue was a Personal At- 
tendant to a Master. The green was 
a Master Carrier. I knew when I 
saw these two colors that a Master 
must be near by. I strained my 
neck to peer in every comer, hop- 
ing to see one, but no such luck 
was mine that day. 

D isappointed, I began the long 
walk around the paneled walk- 
way searching for a Grammer. I 
held my yellow star proudly before 
me so that all would know that I 
was Genetic. 

I passed many sliding doors be- 
fore I came to the rainbow color of 
the Grammer. I walked in without 
hesitation and found the Grammer 



TO SERVE THE MASTERS

right where he belonged. He must 
have been nearly seventy-five years 
old, yet his keen eyes followed his 
nose directly to my yellow star and 
down again to his desk where, with 
an affirmative nod, he checked a 
printed travel list. 

“I don’t have a Guider available 
to show you the remaining way to 
your ship,” he said, “but I can tow 
you a map in genetic code which 
will be easy for you to follow. Is 
that all right?” 

I felt the tightening in my throat 
muscles that always preceded at- 
tempts to convey ideas beyond my 
specialty. My mind raced through 
at least 3000 permutations of the 
DNA molecule, but I still could not 
find a key which could be used to 
communicate the idea of “yes.” My 
tongue became dry; my hands began 
to sweat. The harder I tried, the 
tighter my teeth were held together. 
I strained and tortured my thinking 
to no avail. 

Finally, noting my difficulty — 
and possibly expecting it — the 
Grammer spoke again. “If you ap- 
prove, give me the number of regu- 
lar solids which can be used to fill 
all of space without overlap and 
without leaving a hole of any size. 
If you do not approve, tell me the 
number of heavy-atom isotopes re- 
quired to build the sprassey acid 
molecule.” 

My mind clarified instantly and 
flung itself to the five Platonian 
solids. 1 was in control of me again! 
“Five,” I said. In spite of the fact 
that l knew riiat the Grammer had 
memorized key statements of this 
sort so that he could communicate 



with specialists like me and that he 
didn’t have the vaguest idea what 
he was talking about, I felt relieved 
for the presence of a person with 
such obvious empathy. Yet I felt 
superior to him on this one point. 
For nearly 8000 years, since the 
time of Pythagoras around 500 B.C., 
man has known of the five regular 
polyhedrons. 

Ihe Grammer nodded his head 
again and proceeded to sketch out 
symbols on a piece of plastic board. 
I watched and saw a swift-forming 
diagram of an unknown — at least 
unknown to me — molecule of very 
little complexity. The hydrogen atom 
occured only once. Interlocking en- 
ergy bonds were used to depict hall- 
ways and branches. The normal en- 
ergy nucleus was depicted in three 
dimensions. It had been so long 
since I had used only three dimen- 
sions in depicting molecules that I 
felt somewhat lost. Suddenly, how- 
ever, I recognized that the hydrogen 
atom was my goal and the nitrogen 
atom which was depicted as being 
in a single state of excitement was 
our present location. This was a 
map which I could follow! 

O nce I was settled in the rocket 
cubicle assigned to me I reach- 
ed almost instinctively for my com- 
puter. I knew this was a foolish idea 
but I just had to satisfy my curiosity 
as to whether or not the old Gram- 
mer’s genetic roadmap was a per- 
missible molecule within the energy 
ranges permitted for life. I inserted 
his specifications in the computer 
and found, not too surprisingly, that 
the probability of such a molecule

existing lat all was about equal to the 
(probability of ordinary drinking 
water being generated in the interior 
of a G type star, by the glass full — 
In (the '^ass oontainerl StiU, 1 had 
had to (know. 

Since my cubicle was bare of any 
forms of intellectually satisfying im- 
plements, I was soon faced with the 
prospect of staring at my walls, con- 
centrating on a problem of my own 
invention, or reviewing details of 
life as recorded in my micro-micro- 
computer tape. I suspect that the 
number of life forms recorded in 
considerable detail on this tape 
amounted to nearly 5x1 0®. Its cross- 
indexing feature was likely to fill 
up about the same length of tape as 
the primary data. 

This time, I randomly requested 
any form of life to be found in the 
constellation of Canes Venatici. The 
planet to which I was assigned in 
this region of space was known as 
Stian of a star called Btry. The ran- 
domly selected planet from the same 
constellation was known as Vanatta 
of the star Uni. The tape didn’t con- 
tain the source 'history of the names. 
But no matter; the life form was in- 
teresting in itself. 

Vanatta life seemed to be pre- 
dictated upon the replicative princi- 
ple that ‘^life comes in threes.” For 
some reason yet to be discovered, 
each genetic pattern replicated itself 
three times. The consequences were 
not entirely predictable. In certain 
cases, where the life level was equiv- 
alent to one-celled life on Barth — 
life level twenty — a kind of amor- 
phous “soup” was described. Where- 
as, for level six and our equivalent 



of mammals, life replicated in 
“threes” in a very odd way. There 
were six life forms superficially simi- 
lar and which seemed to produce a 
set of mammal-like forms number- 
ing twenty-seven different shapes, 
sizes and varieties. Yet, and here 
was the real oddity, any combination 
of three mammals — the “original” 
six or the total twenty-seven super- 
ficially distinct — could interbreed 
and produce, at random it would 
seem, any one of the other twenty- 
seven or “original” similar six. No 
one had yet untangled the reason for 
this phenomenon. 

Whenever the life form was re- 
moved from influence of its sun, it 
died. Bvidently the relationship with 
their sun was sensitive; yet nothing 
about the sun’s output could be de- 
termined to be peculiar. 

I was about to request informa- 
tion on the composition of the sun, 
the planet’s atmosphere, density, ra- 
diation distribution and chemical 
distribution when a spiderylike An- 
tarean poked its leathery head in my 
doorway. 

B red for space, the Antareans were 
the Masters’ space servant. The 
Anlarean generally knew everjrthing 
there was to know about space tra- 
vel and problems. Some Histories 
seemed to think that they were the 
original discoverers of contiguous 
space — such discovery having led 
to their absorption into the symbiote 
pool for the benefit of Masters. 

Like ell Masters^ ships, we were 
outfitted with several forms of pro- 
pidsion systems. Some forms took 
advantage of the “equal and opposite

43 




reaction.” Others were concerned 
with travel in special spaces. Polari- 
ty problems, gravity problems and 
mass problems each had their spec- 
ial tool of propulsion. For star tra- 
vel, however, the Antarean estab- 
lished one-to-one correspondence 
with a contained energy system 
which mirrored the stress and strains 
of space. By some sort of multi- 
leveled logic, beyond my genetic 
background to comprehend, they 
created themselves — that is, the 
ship — in several places at the same 
time. Symbolically it was something 
like, “If I am not therei, there 2 , 
therc 4 , . , there„.” By making n 
large enough and tying each 
“therei” to the mirrored energy sys- 
tem, the ship was certain to be at 
the location desired as well as many 
other places. Then, by applying a 
limited oontrapositive to the ani- 
mated hypothesis, one arrived where 
one wished to be. That is, “If I am 
not therei, therc 2 , there 4 , .... 
there^, then I am therea.” 

The Antarean backoned for me to 
come. I left my articles, except for 
my gold star, and followed. 

The Antarean proceeded me into 
the lounge. Here I was very surprised 
to see, first thing, a large number of 
humans. I also recognized the Mas- 
ter Carrier and the Personal Attend- 
ant first met at the spaceport en- 
trance. But as I walked behind the 
crowd, I received the greatest shock 
of my ten^ear-old lifel 
There, with all orifices dangling 
toward the feed pan, was a live Mas^ 
ter! Immediately upon entering the 
Master’s presence “scanning” began. 
I felt, with every cell of my being, 



an aliveness beyond description. It 
was as thou^ each cell of me was 
resonating on the same frequency 
and as though 1 had become more 
than just me. I knew my basic pur- 
pose in life. I knew I was Genetic. 
And without the study of life and 
its endless permutations, I knew 
that life would become meaningless. 
I also knew without equivocation 
that Master was Master and I but 
a small, meek, propitiatory servant 
to the desires — any desires — of 
the Master. I knew that life could 
not be tolerated in any other way! 

For all practical purposes the 
Master’s scanning was continuous on 
each person in the room. Yet I was 
soon able to separate, in my mind, 
me from the Master. 

The Master beckoned to me. With 
extreme feelings of joy, I complied 
by walking toward the Master. He 
bid me halt! With extreme joy, I 
halted. I am sure that if the Master 
had beckoned me to jump into op^ 
space I would have complied with 
equal joy. 

No hypnotism was involved, nor 
any form of mind control. I, as well 
as every other being in the known 
volume of space occupied by the 
Master race, was a product of prior 
genetic screening. In my case, the 
product of 205 screenings. Life just 
could not be thought of any other 
way! 

IV 

A lthough Grammers were present, 
Masters had no need for their 
services, since they were the only 
untrained life form which could con- 



44 



IF 




verse equally well with all other life 
forms. 1 sensed or felt desires and 
impulses which at first 1 tended to 
indentify with my own personality. 
Very soon, however, I was able to 
separate out the “me” from the 
Master’s messages. 

“You are young for an advanced 
Genetic,” he said. 

His eye band, a solid circular band 
of light-sensitive tissue capping off 
the periphery of his ventral side, 
changed to deep green. 

I made no reply, since the Master 
had not requested me to speak. I 
could not have produced any social 
amenities anyway. 

“I selected your ancestors of the 
97th screening. The male and fe- 
male whose protoplasm I caused to 
be joined were each responsible for 
great services to your Masters. The 
female discovered biological means 
for increasing the diversion of genes 
in those egg and sperm combinations 
which were to be subject to later 
screening, which increased the prob- 
ability of selecting a desirable set of 
traits earlier in the screening process. 
The male had extremely good mem- 
ory. But he also had one recessive 
gene which was contraindicated for 
our purpose.” 

I followed the Master’s discussion 
with great interest, for it not only 
blended in with my world of gene- 
tics, but it was the first bit of knowl- 
edge I had regarding my forebears. 

“That male,” the Master contin- 
ued, “was responsible for codifying 
the rules of genetics in such a way 
that a computer could be program- 
med to contain the intrinsic struc- 
ture of all of this science.” 



The Master paused to instruct the 
Carrier to lower him slightly, so 
that his sucking orifice could better 
reach the nutrients in the food pam. 

He continued, “You used the end 
product of his research during most 
of your training cycle whenever you 
placed the pertinent characteristics 
into your computer and the compu- 
ter extrapolated, by purely logical 
means, the result of your factors, 
producing therefrom a simulated 
life model.” 

My mind immediately sped back 
to when I discovered, by means of 
this very process, the basic construc- 
tion common to all Masters which 
enabled them to dominate all other 
life. 1 began to shake with fear that 
my precious and somewhat accident- 
al success would be misconstrued by 
the Master. Apparently, however, 
the Master ignored my thinking or 
did not “receive” it. 

The Master finished sucking at 
the food pan and weaved to be raised 
to a sli^dy higher level. Nearly 
facing me now, the Master contin- 
ued. 

“The male had to be killed, of 
course. The recessive gene contained 
elements of independence which 
could not be trustworthy at. all times. 
I am sure that successive generations 
have eliminated undesirable traits.” 

As the Carrier moved forward 
with the Master, I was urged to fol- 
low behind. He (beckoned me to a 
chair by a simple table and, for the 
first time, addressed his Personal 
Attgidant. 

“Get this male food of his kind. 
Also see that he has access to all 
parts of this ship. His mission is 



TO SERVE THE AAASTERS 



45 




valuable to the Masters. He must 
learn and grow so that he can better 
serve us. His type needs freedom to 
grow.” 

The Master turned to all with his 
final statement. 

“Let no one hinder his learning!” 

M y eyes must have glowed much 
like the Master’s own eye 
band. Althou^ 1 was a genius Gene- 
tic, I had not really expected any 
kind of special treatment in life. 
And here, at age ten, 1 was addressed 
by a live Master and told that my 
“mission is valuable to the Masters.” 
It is true that all life which survives 
does so only because of value -to 
Masters, but my mission was especU 
ally valuable^ the message implied. 

For the first time in my life I 
wished that 1 could communicate 
to others outside of my specialty. 
Failing this, I mentally crosslink^ 
about 15,000 variants of the DNA 
molecule. I took their naturally oc- 
curring ^iral form and stretched it 
by means of imaginary polarity at 
several intermediate points along 
each longitudinal axis, involuted the 
“strings” of contact and extrapolated 
to 27,000 places the mutative ejects 
1 had induced upon the life forms 
resulting from each energy change! 

The Master watched me with, I 
suppose, a contentment that only a 
Master can have for the culmination 
of a long, successful screening. 

The Master was riding only as far 
as one of the planets of the star 
Etry. I bent to my study of life 
forms found in my computer "tape. 
I felt that I was r^y beginning to 
fulfill my basic purpose in life. 



Several contiguous space objec- 
tives were reached, and perhaps a 
day or so was spent at each place. 
I enjoyed meeting different life 
forms, but none were of particular 
complexity. I soon realized that 
those forms which I had met were 
logical outcomes of all I had learned 
from my early genetic training. I 
began to feel that perhaps my learn- 
ing rate would not be as rapid as 
originally anticipated. 

Meanwhile, the Antareans had 
prepared for our contiguous move 
to Stian. Since the key to application 
of contiguous space travel resided 
in how well the energy ball carried 
by the ship duplicated the dominant 
sources of energy points in space, 
occasionally imp^ection of the mir- 
rored universe, or unpredictable 
changes in the universe itself, caused 
the ship to arrive at some place to- 
tally imselected by anyone. The in- 
cidence of occurrence for this kind 
of thing is very, very low. But it 
happens. And for us, on this day, it 
happened. The Master’s eye band 
turned bright pink. The Antareans 
scurried in profound study. 1 felt 
above all the hustle and bustle be- 
cause any space which contained a 
Master was home for me. 

By use of several of the propul- 
sive devices we arrived at a planet 
which seemed to be adequately sit- 
uated for the support of life. The 
difference was soon apparent, how- 
ever. This planet was mostly smelly 
swamp. We landed on a small rising 
where the Master, surrounded al- 
most entirely by Protectors, had 
himself carried to the edges of the 
swampy water. Protectors I had seen 

K 



46 




in tihe ship hut never with their full 
panoply of weapons. 

I believe the Protectors are the 
chief race used by the Masters to 
fi^t new, unscreened life forms 
when needed. The Histories tell that 
this race had the most formidable 
and progressively long history of 
battle for survival of any race 
known. One look at their nearly ro- 
bot-like behavior, coupled with their 
nearly mechanistic weapons of of- 
fense or defense, would underline 
this. 

I wondered why the Master was 
studying the swamp so intently. It 
soon became obvious that the Master 
was screening every possible life 
form to determine if genes potential- 
ly dangerous to Masters were evi- 
dent. Presumably, if such genes were 
available in level four or hi^er, this 
area was not yet under the sway of 
Masters. The first task, then, was to 
find level four or higher life. 

The Master returned to my side 
and resonated, 

“Go to the chief Antarean and 
request all pertinent data now known 
of this planet and its environment. 
If other data is needed, have it made 
available to you by one of the An- 
traeans. Deduce, then, the probabil- 
ity of level four life and its most 
probable whereabouts.” 

T he Antareans were thorough. All 
the information was available 
and neatly catalogued. I already 
surmised the broad features of the 
probable path of life on this planet, 
but I was glad to get the detailed 
data packaged with such predsion 
by the Antareans. 



I set up the proper codes on my 
computer and, through a haif-sjm- 
biosis bom of years of training, com- 
municated with this nearly intelligent 
entity. Between us, the computer and 
I, we resolved all of the most likely 
patterns. 

For the first time I spoke to the 
Master. 

“There are two and only two most 
probable sequences of life patterns 
dominate in our data. They are 
equally obvious from gross data 
which surrounds us. Level four life 
must exist in air or in the water. 
Since the Antareans have successful- 
ly surveyed the whole planet prior 
to landing, only the later possibility 
can be probable.” 

I was confident that this had been 
evident to the Master from the start 
and so I continued. 

“In the past 250,000 years, home- 
ostatic balances have been tending 
toward more land and less water sur- 
face exposure. However, the rate at 
which the change has occurred has 
caused the waters to absorb a great- 
er than usual amount of organic ma- 
terials. These, in turn, have caused 
most all of the water to be unclear 
or muddy throughout the planet. If 
level four beings are to exist, they 
would not yet have been able to 
adapt to an environment with little 
or no light. They would, therefore, 
exist wherever the water is the clear- 
est. Presumably along the edges of 
underwater currents, no matter how 
sluggish, level four life might be 
found. 

“Furthermore,” I continued, 
“they will unquestionably have some 
means of making light — probably 



TO SERVE THE MASTERS 



47 




through utilization and domestica- 
tion of underseas luminescent crea- 
tures. If the Antareans csS. make 
the proper chemical or infrared 
survey of large areas, distinguishing 
between the heat of planets as dis- 
tinct from unusual statistical anomo- 
lies — inhomogeneities of light 
sources — I think you will find the 
life at one of these clusters.” 

The Antareans not only could, 
but did. We soon located several 
hundred sources of unusual light ac- 
tivity along the edges of underwater 
currents. 

For the first time in my life I had 
been useful to a Masterl My eyes 
danced, my steps were lighter, and 
I now knew what “pleasure of liv- 
ing” implied. 

Ours was not a “contact” vessel 
so our mechanical probes were rath- 
er ineffective. After many trials, the 
Master sent several Protectors down 
in jury-rigged pressure suits. The 
Protectors, too, were eluded. Evi- 
dently only the Master, with his 
special sensory apparatus, could do 
the job. 

So the Master descended with all 
of his Protectors. I don’t know what 
happened down below, and neither 
does any one else who remained on 
the surface. The surviving Protector 
knows, but he cannot tell us any- 
thing. After about three hours of 
waiting at the surface of the murky 
water, enormous geysers shot high 
in the air. They could only have 
been caused by weapons carried by 
the Protector. The geysers continued 
for a very long time and then, sud- 
denly, the whole surface of the water 
turned inky black. All of the plant 



life at or near the surface of the 
water turned black and shriveled up 
on contact with whatever was com- 
ing to the top. It was like dropping 
acid on the leaf of a plant. 

The burned, black area became 
larger and, near the center of the 
black, a Protector, holding onto the 
small underseas vehicle of the Mas- 
ter, pushed to the surface in great 
haste. I could see the outer suit of 
the Protector becoming charred and 
black while, with great anxiety, I 
watched until I saw a small feeding 
orifice drop through a pitted hole 
in the Master’s craft. 

W e were all thankful that the 
Master’s life had been spared. 
The Master stayed in a state of ex- 
treme terror for nearly forty-^tive 
days before ship life returned to 
normal. We orbited around the 
swampy planet for the wihole period, 
waiting for rational directions. 
Whenever the Master left his cubicle 
he always had his remaining Protec- 
tor near him. He also very carefully 
avoided any reference to his experi- 
ence. 

The Master called in the chief 
Antarean and asked him, directly, 
the best way to return to our portion 
of the universe. The Antarean’s an- 
swer was immediate. It seems that 
any space-exploring vehicle faces the 
same problem in greater or lesser 
detail. An application of the inverse 
to the contra-positive gave, “If I 
am theres, then I am not therei, 
there2, there4, . , there„.” This 
seemed to work all right if one had 
only one correct energy image from 
the known universe in the energy

bowl. In practice, however, it seem- 
ed to operate more like the positive 
feedback of a butterfly trying to fly 
to a brilliant flame. We certainly 
‘‘butterflied” all over the universe 
before we successfully located our 
known segment of the universe and 
subsequently landed at Stiah. 

This flight had given me experi- 
ence in ways which I had not anti- 
cipated. I couldn’t help but wonder 
why the Master hadn’t asked the 
Antarean how to get home from the 
first. Why, also, was it so important 
for the Master to contact the life on 
the other planet when he was plan- 
ning to go on to Stian anyway? With 
my analytical approach to life 1 
couldn’t help but summarize what I 
had learned: (1) Masters are not 
prime causes in the universe. (2) 
Only a relatively small pordoh of 
the universe is controlled by the 
Master Race. (3) Masters can be 
immobilized by terror, are cowardly 
and can be injured or even killed. 
(4) Masters are not very intelligent. 
And (5) 1 love Masters! 

Quite an education for a ten-year- 
old cowlike domesticated member of 
the human race! 

V 

B efore departing the ship on Stian 
I was again ushered into the 
Master’s presence. This time the 
Carrier held him in such a way that 
his charred and blackened orifice 
tube dangled into a small cup of 
medicated fluids. Again 1 felt the 
cxhiliarating effects of the Master’s 
scanning. 

‘*Your race,” he began, “has a 



penchant for creative work in the 
biologrcal sciences. Thousands of 
years ago we Masters determined to 
seek out a race such as yours. By 
careful selection and breeding you 
have become the first of the line 
who we believe to be capable of 
serving us in a very special way.” 

The Personal Attendant removed 
some sort of decoration or instru- 
ment from the round ball which 
composed the ventral portion of the 
Master. My mouth bwame dry and 
my hands moist as 1 struggled, again, 
to formulate questions regarding his 
implication that I was one of many. 

The Master continued, “We Mas- 
ters have a very special problem. 
As you have seen, while the volume 
of our living space increases as the 
cube of the radius of our expansion, 
our birth rate is now constant, since 
we utilize the whole planet surface 
for reproduction. But the rate of 
increase virtually halts any reason- 
able expansion of our space control. 
Since it is the Masters’ place to rule 
all life, the problems must be solv- 
ed!” 

I thought of Vanatta’s peculiar 
life which came in threes and won- 
dered if there might not be some 
relationship between Vanatta’s in- 
ability to propagate away from her 
sun and similar difficulties for the 
Master Race. 

“A Master will discuss this prob- 
lem with you in detail upon your 
completion of advanced training,” 
he finished. 

I was pleased to note that where- 
ever I traveled, the Master’s admoni- 
tion for complete cooperation pre- 
ceded me. Stian’s life forms were 



TO SERVE THE MASTERS 



49 








simple variants of caiibon, nitrogen, 
hydrogen and phosphorus. I checked 
gross form prediction from primary 
molecular structures for levels twen- 
ty, seven, four and two. No signifi- 
cant deviation from fact could be 
observed. The highest life level on 
Stian was two — a life form gener- 
ally weak in science but growing a 
sound technological base. The Stian 
himself was a highly chitinous form 
of life with clusters of clawlike fin- 
gers located in such a way that op- 
position of fingers was guaranteed 
for nearly every desired direction. 

I further found the Stians to be 
neither friendly nor unfriendly but 
simply behaving in ways that were 
directed by Masters. 

My hotel suite was all that could 
be desired for comfort. More com- 
fortable than my training cubicle, yet 
supplied with all of the scientific 
aids which might be successfuMy util- 
ized; it made me feel important. Stall 
I felt uneasy about my present quest 
for advanced knowledge. Somehow 
I knew that I should alter my plans 
by going directly to Vanatta. Yet, 
without the proper reason to justify 
my feelings, I could only bro^. 

I brooded a good bit. Lacking a 
Master’s way of scanning immediate- 
ly to the core of the matter, I began 
to sense an incompleteness in my 
own ability to face up to simple 
problems. Yet wasn’t I genius Gene- 
tic? 

Eventually I was able to phrase 
the problem in terms of my special- 
ty. Teachers probably view^ my 
trip as “advanced” only in the sense 
of helping me to verify that the basic 
structures of genetic knowledge are 



50 



IF 



sound. With their end m view, I had 
been guided through an itinerary 
which would sample various hypo- 
theses. Whereas, / viewed “advanc- 
ed” from the point of view of f^ing 
and solving more and more prob- 
lems composed of challenges to the 
structure of genetic science. Briefly 
stated, my continued growth as a 
Genetic was in the facing of un- 
knowns like Vanatta. Certainly I 
could not grow by following my 
present itinerary! 

Although exhausted both emotion- 
ally and physically from my earlier 
attempts to view this question from 
the point of view of a Master, I 
still rushed to change my direction 
of travel. A ship with full Antarean 
crew was made available to me as 
soon as my desires were communi- 
cated through a Grammer. 

VI 

I knew from Vanatta’s 2.4 density 
as well as its gaseous envelope, 
opaque to all but ultraviolet, that 
life molecules here would tend to be 
both lighter and heavier in weight. 
Lighter because initial chance meet- 
ings of chemical elements would be 
favored for the lighter elements. 
Heavier, because each life molecule 
would need an opaque protective 
shield to prevent the ultraviolet radi- 
ation from disrupting the bonds 
which hold together the larger, com- 
plex molecules. I also knew that 
neither of these two effects was suf- 
ficient to cause the atypical behav- 
ior of Vanatta’s life. I was eager to 
land, and sure that my choice for 
growth was correct. 



PRPOjECTOJt,

51 



At Vanatta’s spaceport, I >grabbed 
my small ensemble of personal pos- 
sesmons and quickly walked to l£c 
cubicle with the colors of the rain- 
bow. The QranMner proved to be 
another human like myself. He ac- 
cepted my nod with one swift glance 
at my proffered yellow star — the 
sign of the Genetic — and then be- 
gan to speak. 

“Your arrival has been prepared. 
Make yourself comfortable and look 
at the enclosed list of sp^ifications. 
I have (been instructed by the Mas- 
ters to see that you have every pos- 
sible form of cooperation. I must 
admit that their overriding command 
is peculiar within my experience. 
Naturally 1, as well as all others here 
on Vanatta, will do every^dng re- 
quired of us.” 

Once again 1 was impressed with 
the sense of order and purpose 
brought to all plane^ ruled by Mas- 
ters. All of us, human and alien, 
were certainly fortunate to be 'guided 
by such beings, brin^g us all to 
a full sense of direction, purpose 
and accomplishment for the Master! 

The Grammer continued, “When 
you have reviewed the preliminary 
specifications for your scientific 
needs here, and possibly made fur- 
ther selections, I would like to give 
you a brief summary of the services 
which are available to you.” 

1 looked at the list and, much to 
my surprise, saw nearly a complete 
laboratory as well as sundry support- 
ing elements. In my own eyes, my 
stature as well as the importance of 
my mission increased. Only the lo- 
cation of the laboratory — in the 
heart of a large city — was possibly 



oontraindioated for my studies. Since 
the matter was connected to my 
work I found it easy to vocalize my 
feeling. 

The Grammer, tall and gnarled of 
appear^ce, accepted my request 
with characteristic patience. I was 
fitted with an Antarean spacesuit 
so that I -might move between hu- 
man environment buildings and, 
much to my surprise again, the 
Grammer indicated that he was as- 
signing himself to me for the dura- 
tion of my stay. 

T he Grammer, whom I learned 
to call Grammer, directed our 
track vehicle to a hotel suitable for 
our temporary needs. Tingling with 
great excitement, I fell asleep with 
difficulty. My last thought was mix- 
ed in nature. 1 thought of the special 
problems of Vanatta which could 
be so exciting to a Genetic. I 
thought, too, of the continuous close 
worl^g relationship between my- 
self and the Grammer. Humans I 
had known, but never continuously 
for any length of time. Would this 
•relatively young, perhaps 25 years 
old, Grammer exhibit traits of hu- 
man behavior hitherto unobserved 
by me? Would the concept of “af- 
fection” be reborn by our close re- 
lationship? Neither the Histories nor 
my Teachers had prepared me for 
the experience! 

The next morning the Grammer 
and I rode a second track vehicle 
to a cubicle in the City of Uni which 
contained the equivalent of Vanatta 
government. Here, encumbered by 
our suits, we were escorted to a 
large wall map showing the contours 




vn 



of the planet as well as traffic trib- 
utary systems. Interpreted by Gram- 
mer, I learned that the network did 
not depict any pattern of “threes” 
os might he expected from the na- 
ture of Vanatta life. Grammer mem- 
orized the main features of the 
board and, between the two of us, 
we were able to locate several geo- 
graphical positions which seemed to 
fit my requirements. 

I knew that Vanatta had no large 
ocean or lake systems but that pools 
of condensed vapors formed at the 
foot of most hills. Since Vanatta 
consisted mostly of rolling hills, 
most of its terrain was sprinkled 
with these condensations. I wanted 
to locate near one of these. I also 
wanted to be away from civilization 
as known in the cities of Vanatta, 
yet close enough to be able to ob- 
serve and compare life in its differ- 
ent levels of complexity. Via hover- 
craft, Grammer and I searched until 
a satisfactory location was discover- 
ed. 

I expected to go back to our hotel 
cubicle and await word that some 
sort of primitive structure had been 
erected. Again this Grammer sur- 
prised me. He reached for the radio 
broadcasting equipment and, in sev- 
eral swift syllables, ordered work to 
begin. 

Within 15 minutes, large hov- 
ercraft were carrying pre-assembled 
structures, while other hovercraft 
directed their assembly. I can’t be- 
lieve that more than three hours 
passed between their arrival and the 
signal to Grammer that my modern 
laboratory was ready for immediate 
occupancy. 



I was, at first, quite optimistic 
about solving the genetic prob- 
lem posed by Vanatta life. Wasn’t I, 
by the admission of the Masters, the 
end product of a long line of humans 
bred for the sole purpose of being 
genius Genetic? 

Nearly five years passed before 
real progress was gained! My 10- 
year-old optimism (and egotism) 
soon evolved to a pattern of careful 
scientific thinking. As time passed, 
I learned to challenge more and 
more basic tenets taught to me by 
Teachers and my unshakeable teach- 
ing machine. Answers proved to be 
basic — and simple! 

Grammer and I became quite 
close. I learned what “affection” 
meant and vowed, in my own sub- 
conscious way, to retain Grammer 
as my assistant throu^out my ser- 
vice to Masters. On Grammer’s part, 
his expression remained as nearly 
unreadable as ever. I knew, thou^, 
that this was his genetic heritage just 
as my peculiarities were mine. I 
knew, too, that he shared my feel- 
ings of affection. 

The equivalent of one-celled life 
(or one-celled colony life) could 
only be found in an amorphous form 
on Vanatta. Between this life level 
twenty and the next level of nine- 
teen, there was a jump which could 
not be accounted for by theory. Ex- 
planations of this gap was, 1 felt, 
the key to explaining, or at least 
leading to an explanation of the rea- 
son why Vanatta’s life could not be 
reproduced away from their sun. 
Unlike our earth colonies, level

twenty life ihere was not true cellular 
life. It seemed to ifail to produce the 
^uivalent of our colony specializa- 
tion. 

One-celled life, like the Chlamy- 
domonas, begin the process on 
Earth. Pandorina was composed of 
eight cells embedded in a spherical 
matrix of jellylike material, yet none 
of these eight were much different 
from Chlyamydomonas. The com- 
bined beating of their flagella cause 
the entire colony to act in unison 
for locomotion. 

Another form, the Pleodorina, is 
composed of many more cells clus- 
tered in the shape of a hollow 
sphere; aside from the increased 
number of cells there is little differ- 
ence between this one and Pan- 
dorina. 

One difference is striking, how- 
ever; it is that the smaller cells, the 
soma, are sterile for reproduction 
purposes while the larger are not. 
So at this level some specialization 
has begun. 

A much larger aggregate is the 
Volvbx, a beautiful hollow spherical 
colony consisting of several thousand 
cells. Again, these resemble the 
Chlamydomonas in most respects, 
although there are tiny bridges be^ 
tween individuals which tend to lock 
them together more securely than 
the loose jelly or other forms. Al- 
most all of the cells are alike, al- 
though there are some that are larger 
and have a different appearance. 
These are reproductive cells. Some 
are bundles of small bodies, the 
sperm or male cells, while others 
are large ovoid egg cells. These spec- 
ial sex cells reproduce the colony 



by a sexual process where the sperm 
are released into water, where they 
swim to and unite with the egg. 
This subsequently becomes a zygote 
which overwinters in a heavy-walled 
case. Other reproductive cells mere- 
ly divide and move into the hollow 
of the sphere where they become 
small colonies, known as daughter 
colonies. These eventually burst out, 
destroying the mother and becom- 
ing adult colonies themselves. 

Two important events occur in 
this gradual association of cells. 
First, similar cells aggregate into a 
mass which apparently succeeds bet- 
ter. That is, there is strength in un- 
ion. Second, division of labor is ini- 
tiated among the cells, some becom- 
ing sterile and functioning only in 
locomotion, whereas others retain 
the primitive condition of colony- 
reproduction. From here, differentia- 
tion of the soma cells continues in 
various directions toward greater 
and greater complexity, and thus up 
the long trail to such hi'^y intricate 
forms as Masters and their servants. 

V anatta life, contrariwise, had 
jumped from lifelike chemicals 
at level twenty to relatively high 
forms of life. Vanatta had these key 
peculiarities to untangle: 

1. Life would not reproduce be- 
yond its own sim. 

2. Level twenty life consisted of 
a homogeneous, soupy, lifelike 
chemical. 

3. From level twenty, life jumped 
to level six with no apparent inter- 
mediate steps. 

4. Level six life consisted of six 
basic similar patterns, any three of 



54 



IF 




iwlhidh could reproduce its own kind 
as well as twenty-seven other appar- 
ently unrelated patterns. 

5. All thirty-three forms could re- 
produce, by reproduction in 
“ithrees,” to produce any of the 
others in an unknown or unpredict- 
able manner. 

6. A basic reproduction unit is 
any three life-level six entities. 

I decided, after nearly two years 
of fruitless effort, that it was not 
only the Masters who were ignorant. 
One Master had told me that Van- 
atta life was incapable of being re- 
produced beyond its sun. I had ac- 
o^ted this in the way it was tender- 
ed — that is, the direct influence 
of some mysterious energy of Van- 
atta’s sun determined and remained 
as a vital agent of Vanatta life. The 
question which seemed to me to dis- 
play my own ignorance was this: 
Did life of Vanatta really find it 
impossible to reproduce away from 
the sun? Or was it merely a case of 
absence of supporting symibiotes re- 
quired for the breeding process? 
When the answer was reached I 
compared my intelligence unfavora- 
bly with the intelligence of a Master! 

We, Grammer and I, established 
the basic ecology of a small Van- 
atta mammal c^ed a Bra. After 
several months of close observation 
in a closed environment we shipped 
three Bra to another solar system. 
In due time we received the news 
that the Bras had brought forth 
three apparently unrelated mammals 
— yet to be found in our list of 
thirty-three. 

Hindsight is easier than foresight. 
Still, I, genius Genetic, deserved all 



criticism for this, my first research 
error. Never again would 1 be so 
willing to accept any statement, as 
truth, whether made by book or 
Master. Everyone knew that Van- 
atta life could not reproduce beyond 
its own star. Yet the truth lay some- 
where in the ecology of the life 
form, not in peculiarities of its star! 

vm 

M y success in reproducing the 
Bras away from Vanatta’s sun 
caused reverberation throughout the 
space of the Masters. This time, ten 
Masters scanned Grammer and me 
simultaneously. I shivered both with 
fear and with anticipation. 1 couldn’t 
help but feel buoyed up by the per- 
sonal attention of so many Masters. 
Yet my analytical talents continued 
their ever-searching classification of 
fact, and I noted, for the first time, 
their similarity of appearance. 

Each Master was a small ball-like 
object with trailing feeding orifices, 
slender, tapered simple of con- 
struction. The light-sensitive tissue 
forming a sniall circle around the 
crest of their orblike body faded 
through pink, red, j^een and blue, 
reflecting, I believ^, the state of the 
‘^emotions.” Eiach had the same col- 
or of neutral gray, laced delicately 
with a twin diamo^-shaped pattern 
where was found the primary sens- 
ing organ for their scanning func- 
tions. 

1 counted the personal retinues 
and found each Master with Carrier, 
Personal Attendant and six or seven 
other specialities. Nearly 100 life- 
forms of one type or another trailed

behind or held the Masters or fed 
them. Certainly this was an impres- 
sive example of cooperation of life 
foimsi This in itself was justification 
for dominance of the Masters! 

One Master spoke: “You have 
been bred for your job. Therefore, 
what you do is pleasure. But we 
Masters have waited for many gen- 
erations for the promise of solution 
to our breeding and consequent 
space dominance problem. We have 
come to commend you for your ef- 
forts on our behalf.” 

I knew that once again the Mas- 
ters were jumping to the wrong con- 
clusion. I broke in hastily. 

‘T have not solved Vanatta’s prob- 
lems, Master.” 

The speaking Master’s eyb band 
turned bright pink as he replied 
equally hastily, “But you have bred 
Bras outside of this system, haven’t 
you?” 

“Yes,” I replied. “But all I’ve 
shown is that the life of higher 
forms depends in some manner on 
its own lower forms. And that these 
forms are not equivalent to others 
found elsewhere.” 

I tried a new approach. 

“Masters,” I said, “I cannot ex- 
plain what I must. But before I can 
accomplish my basic purpose in life, 
1 must finish my training here on 
Vanatta. I am only now beginning 
to mature in this respect.” 

Reluctantly, it seemed, the Mas- 
ters acceded to my request to post- 
pone work on their problem. Once 
again Grammer and I were left to 
our own devices. 

Life continued, and I made slow 
but steady progress. Grammer en- 

56 



joyed music, books and reading his 
professional Grammer literature. I 
le^ed, slowly, to enjoy a slightly 
alcoholic dri^ each night with 
Grammer. We would sit beside the 
music computer, drink in hand, and 
listen with pleasure to the various 
permutations and combinations form- 
ed. At least Grammer enjoyed the 
sounds. I enjoyed sitting next to 
Grammer and the feel of compan- 
ionship which was denied so many 
of my race. 

I Imew I wasn’t disloyal to the 
Masters since I was doing exactly 
what they wanted me to do. Any- 
way, it would have been impossible 
to be disloyal! 

DC 

T he second breakthrough oc- 
curred when I compared the 
nucleus of any of Vanatta’s life at 
each level against that of Earth cells. 
Of course this kind of comparison 
had been made before, but the con- 
clusions reached were not correct. I 
noticed that all of Vanatta life forms, 
except the lowest “soupy” level twen- 
ty, contained more than one set of 
genes. The “breeding in three” phen- 
omenon turned out to be directly 
related to the fact that exactly three 
different sets of genes were contained 
in each cell. This puzzled me for 
some time, until I remembered that 
back in the twentieth century, two 
British scientists. Dr. Henry Harris 
and Dr. John F. Watkins, had dem- 
onstrated that cells from different 
animals, including man, can be fused 
and that the new hybrid cells are able 
to live and multiply. 

IF 




At that time, on my native Earth, 
living comibinations of hybrid cells 
were formed from specks as diverse 
as hens and rabbits, and men and 
mice. I remembered this information 
well not only because it marked a 
significant milestone in genetic re- 
search, but because I would normally 
be exposed to all available informa- 
tion, whether important or trivial, in 
the course of my training. I could 
even remember that Dr. Harris re- 
ported his work in a publication 
known as Discovery in April, 1966. 
I was never taught what a “maga- 
zine” was, however. 

A close study of the “soupy” level 
twenty life revealed the interesting 
information that there were perhaps 
several million different types of 
complete genes scattered throughout 
as many different cells. The DNA, 
which contains the coded heritable 
information which is passed on from 
generation to generation, and RNA, 
which is the “messenger” carrying 
these codes, each contributed their 
own unique effect upon the cell 
body. A given cell foimd in this 
“soupy” mixture would often con- 
tain as many as ten different gene 
structures. Since each structure could 
“tell” the cell body what to do with- 
out “interference” from other un- 
like structures, life necessarily re- 
tained its primitive flavor. Under 
such unintegrated conditions, life 
could not develop beyond this stage! 
Since there are no incompatible 
mechanisms, like those which re- 
sult in the destruction of tissue or 
organ grafts exchanged between dif- 
ferent individuals, the composite 
cells carry out life functions in an 



apparently integrated manner. The 
instructions which the genes of one 
“species” in the hybrid cell trans- 
mit are understood and acted upon 
by the cytoplasm of other “species.” 

The vehicle for this activity on 
Vanatta was twofold: A peculiar 
form of virus which appeared to 
be pervasive, endlessly, throu^out 
the texture of Vanatta’s atmospheric 
blanket was weakened or killed by 
the strong ultraviolet radiation ex- 
tant throughout Vanatta daylight 
hours. The dead or weakened viral 
material generally found itself mixed 
or diffused throughout the ecologi- 
cal system — particularly whenever 
condensation of Vanatta’s gaseous 
blanket occurred. The viral material, 
although dead, in turn performed in 
almost exactly the same manner as 
in Dr. Harris’s original work. He 
exposed dead virus to cells of dif- 
ferent species. The cells clumped 
together. The membranes dissolved 
at the points of contact and their 
cytoplasms merged. When the nuc- 
lei of different cells merged, the new 
cell contained several nuclei of dif- 
ferent species which was called a 
heterokaryon. The cell remained 
alive and continued to function, 
synthesizing DNA and RNA. Some- 
times the nuclei fused to form a 
larger nucleus, and sometimes they 
divided to form several daughter 
cells. Here on Vanatta, primitive 
cells evolving from their own chance 
encounters, when in contact with 
this peculiar virus, dissolved at their 
points of contact, and the result was 
a primitive hybrid life form. 

The problem of “threes” was evi- 
dently solved. Yet the mystery of

57 




the great jump from level twenty 
to level six remained. 

D uring the next year I greatly 
increased my challenges of the 
pimciples which maike up “genetic 
science.” At the same time, 1 great- 
ly increased my disdain for the ab- 
soluteness of any theory. In the 
meantime I learned several new 
things from Grammer. 

It seems that Grammer had once 
talked with a female of our species. 
1 had not really thou^t about this 
a^ect of life before. It was true 
that our life form required two for 
reprodnotioh. But the Masters had 
long ago instituted a bank of ova 
and plasma from which they sup- 
plied their technicians and which 
sufficed for their needs. Since 
growth of the fertilized ovum was 
carefully controlled by the techni- 
cians until “birth,” no need for such 
ancient concepts as “mother,” “fath- 
er” and so forth existed. I was such 
a baby. And from birth on, I was 
subject to either nurses who were 
trained to provide for only the 
ordinary processes necessary to bio- 
logical growth; or I was subject to 
the Teachers. The concept of “fe- 
male” had not ever entered my en- 
vironment or my thoughts until 
placed there by Grammer. 

The closer I approached to fifteen 
years of age the more interest I 
seemed to feel in the concept. It 
was clear that Grammer had long 
had such an interest. I saw him 
look with feeling of melancholy 
whenever he discussed the experi- 
ence of communicating with and for 
a female. 



When Grammer was taking his 
final education -trip throughout Mas- 
ter’s ^ace he was ordered to accom- 
pany a group of Protectors. They 
were on their way to a planet which 
was located deep within the space 
controlled by the Masters but which 
had not been communicated with for 
several generations. As a matter of 
fact, the existence of the planet 
had been lost for all this time. Nor- 
mally the Master who controls each 
planet is responsible for whatever 
governmental activities are required 
between systems. In this instance, the 
Master had neglected to communi- 
cate for some time. Meanwhile, 
someone whose normal day-to-day 
work was coordinating activities be- 
tween thousands of planets had over- 
looked this one. 

Ent, by name, was Earthlike in 
flora and fauna. It had been colon- 
ized by Masters with human metal 
miners to serve as the raw material 
source for cc^per. A Protector ship, 
tretuiming from duties having to do 
with expanding the boundaries of 
Master’s space, accidentally redis- 
covered the planet. According to the 
Antarean space catalogue, Ent was a 
rediscovery. 

The first ship to land on Ent was 
attacked without warning by level 
one humans. Except for the Pro- 
tector’s nucleonic shield, all would 
have been pulverized when the first 
bomb exploded. Subsequent police 
action by the Protectors soon deci- 
mated most of the population, leav- 
ing only a small, hard-core group 
hiding in bombproof shelters under 
the main cities. 

Eventually the Protectors succed- 

re 



58 




ed in introducing a non-lethal gas 
into these caverns, thus capturing all 
of the remaining humans intact. 
These consisted predominantly of 
unscreened women and children. The 
children, of course, were put to 
death instantly, since the Masters 
did not need any more raw stock 
of this type. The women were saved 
for questioning. 

Grammer was given the job of 
questioning the women and of trans- 
lating for the Protectors. The story 
which he learned was this: Genera- 
tions ago, a Master had entered a 
deep copper mine which also con- 
tained strata of radioactivity. Al- 
though much of the minin g work 
was automate^, this Master had the 
unusual desire to experience life un- 
der tons of earth crust. He, his Car- 
rier and his Personal Attendant fol- 
lowed the automated tracks without 
being aware of the radiation hazard. 
The Master had his “picnic” be- 
low surface, returned to his regxilar 
home cubicle and lived life normal 
to all outward appearances. 

As the years went by, however, 
the scanning mechanism of the Mas- 
ter deteriorated swiftly. When the 
Master thought he was “reading” 
one thing, the facts were that he 
was reading another. Under this un- 
familiar condition of faulty screen- 
ing, a group of human deviants, 
antipathic to the order of Masters, 
was accidentally born and survived. 
These, in turn, took advantage of 
the Master’s condition and rapidly 
turned all technology toward their 
own ends. 

Eventually the Master was killed 
and the planetwide government tak- 



en over by the deviants. Only , by 
equally unlikdy accident — the loss 
of space coordinates — the 
existence of Ent forgotten by the 
rest of civilization. 

Grammer retold this story to me 
many times. Each time he would fin- 
ish with a descriptioh of a “cute 
little blue-eyed brown^head” who 
seemed to affect him in some very 
unusual way. He didn’t actually cry 
when he thought of her, but he came 
close to it. I still didn’t understand 
why he felt this way about such 
purely hereditary traits as “blue 
eyes,” “brown hair,” “red lips,” 
“nice figure,” and so on; but I did 
understand his feelings over loss of 
companionship! 

After many months of interroga- 
tions, Grammer was present when all 
remaining human life on Ent was 
destroyed. I believe that his enigma- 
tic disposition must stem from that 
day! 

X 

F or the one billionth time, it 
seemed, I fed varying axioms 
about life to my computer. These 
axioms opposed, in either a major 
or minor way, the fundamentals 
about life which I had learned as a 
student in the training cubicle. This 
day, nearly five years from my ini- 
tial arrival on Vanatta, I challenged 
the derivable consequences of the 
first goal of life — to survive! 

Life usually can be thought of 
as requiring an accretion of life to 
life. That is“ life begets life, and if 
the quantity of life it begets is not 
greater, by some small fraction at 



TO SERVE THE MASTERS 



59 




least, life does not survive in that 
form. 1 challenged this assumption 
in a very slight way. When life 
increases, space is consumed. But 
this attribute is considered a secon- 
dary manifestation of the fact that 
life begets life — and increases in 
number. The fact that a 1.1% rate 
of compounded increase in numbers 
of life units results in, say, 1.1% 
compounded increase in space utili- 
zation is definitely not considered 
a basic postulate upon which to 
build a science called genetics. That 
is, one doesn’t postulate the major 
goal of life as to “consume” space! 

Yet the consequences of “to sur- 
vive,” when taken in context of the 
Vanatta problem, led directly to 
consideration of this new axiom. In 
turn, consequences of the acceptance 
of this as a fundamental axiom led 
directly to my final solution of the 
Vanatta problem. 

Many years ago, according to the 
Histories, a human cargo called the 
Pythagoreans tried to reduce the 
whole universe to number and geom- 
etry. One of the problems which 
they developed was to imagine a 
plane figure which could be used 
repetitively in the plane to fill all 
of the plane and leave no points 
unfilled and without overlap. One 
such figure turned out to be an 
equilateral triangle. 

Another problem was to find a 
three-dimensional figure which could 
be used repetitively to fill all of 
space. One such figure is the tetra- 
hedron; another is the cube. Only 
five regular solid figures have this 
property. 

In the unrecorded past of Van- 



atta, chance combinations of chrom- 
osomal materials finally 'provided a 
three-way structure which was truly 
integrated at more than the primi- 
tive level necessary to sustain life 
for an individual cell. Even my ad- 
vanced science of genetics, aid^ by 
my computer, would be hard pressed 
to predict the many potential life 
forms which each nuclei, of the re- 
sulting hybrid cells, might have pro- 
pagated if directed by the course of 
normal evolution. 

Chance combinations had pro- 
duced a particular family of gene 
structures which not only sustained 
level six life, but whose configura- 
tion provided an internal protective 
sheath which prevented additional 
nuclei from entering their successful 
form of hybridization. The sheath 
followed an elementary rule of 
“filling all of space” thus enabling 
the cell to protect itself under siege 
of the viral material so peculiar to 
Vanatta. 

The consequences of this protec- 
tion was that three nuclei were free 
to pursue their own joint evolution- 
ary path throughout the ages. This 
combination, and only this combin- 
ation, could have been responsible 
for higher levels consisting of thirty- 
three “varieties.” 

Naturally, too, “breeding” was re- 
quired in “three,” for, unless all 
three components were present to 
share chromosomal materials, no 
life was possible except in rudimen- 
tary form. Vanatta life was truly hy- 
bridized yet could only breed true 
as a hybrid! 

Orammer and I had solved the 
problem of Vanatta. I was fifteen

}rears of age. I was now much more 
confident of my problem-solving 
abilityl 

XI 

I believe that any of the servants 
of the Masters are raised in a 
sheltered environment. Mine was 
particularly so. But even if this were 
not true, there would be no need 
for guards or special personnel 
trained to protect other beings. Ex- 
cept for the Protectors, of course. 
Crime was unknown, consequently 
prisons unneeded. Each being had 
his place in the well organized struc- 
ture of the Master Race, and if the 
being did not fulfill his allotted func- 
tion a new personality was reared as 
a replacement. This, naturally, was 
one of the great benefits which the 
Master Race had given to other be- 
ings including humanity — peace 
and orderl 

Grammer and I finished packing 
our vital records and other needs 
in preparation for departure to the 
planet of the Masters. Simultan- 
eously, it seemed, we realized that 
never before had we heard discussed, 
or mentioned ourselves, the location 
of the planet of Masters. 

In the normal course of this kind 
of travel preparation we would have 
relayed our request to the proper 
travel specialist, who in turn would 
prepare our schedule in some de- 
tail. This time, oddly, none of the 
travel sjpecialists could give us any 
idea where the Master home star 
was. Nor could they prepare a 
schedule. 

Grammer carried on the bulk of 



communication as was his duty. But 
even he began to despair when by 
evening we were still no closer^to 
our objective. Although more time 
might be involved in locating a 
Master, gaining his attention and 
presenting our little problem, it be- 
gan to appear that this was the 
only possible way. 

With no thought to the unusual- 
ness of receiving an unexpected visi- 
tor, Grammer answered our door 
summons, deep in thought. Both of 
us were shocked by the rapidity 
with which several dozen Protectors 
surrounded us. With obvious pro- 
fessional detachment they forced us 
into our environmental suit without 
allowing us the courtesy of an ex- 
planation. Our final destination 
turned out to be an antiseptically 
clean cell — one for each of usi 
Although we were fed, watered 
and ibedded prqperly each day, 
Grammer could raise no single word 
from any guard. I, of course, could 
not have formulated anything un- 
derstandable to such people. I 
learned what it meant to be lone- 
some — to miss associations with 
Grammer. I was exceedingly pained 
to ibe denied the privilege of serving 
the Masters. I lost track of time. 1 
became despondent.' I lost weight 
and my appetite. Soon my waking 
periods blended into each other and 
into my sleeping periods. I vege- 
tated! 

A rousal and consciousness return- 
ed to me almost immediately 
upon sensing the Master’s usual 
scanning process. Strangely enough, 
my analytical functions fixed upon

the Master’s Carrier • — measuring 
the height from the floor to the 
position in which the Master was 
carried — and then upon the usual 
retinue which trailed behind the 
Master. The particular Master who 
entered my cell looked exactly like 
all of the other Masters which I 
had seen. 

Then the Master spoke. “I have 
already talked with the Grammer. I 
understand that you have completed 
your studies on Vanatta and are now 
ready to help us with our problem.” 

“Yes,” I said with great surprise. 

“We Masters are so important to 
the continuity of an orderly rule in 
all the universe, and we are so few, 
that we feel it vitally necessary to 
protect the sole source of our breed- 
ing. We did not distrust you, since 
it is obvious from our scanning that 
you and Grammer are loyal and al- 
ways shall be. But we long ago learn- 
ed from the Protectors several ways 
by which our beneficial rule can be 
placed in jeopardy.” 

I realized that I was getting an 
explanation for our treatment. 
Needless to say, I listened very 
carefully, hoping to hear a rational 
explanation. 

“On rare occasions. Masters be- 
come sick through accident or radia- 
tion in which case our scanning 
sense becomes unreliable. The pro- 
duct of such an unfortunate ex- 
perience might be the birth and 
growth of life inimical to our kind. 
If any such knew the source of our 
birth, they might easily destroy us. 
Also, as you know, there are areas 
of the universe at the boundaries 
of the Master rule where races live 



which have not had the benefit of 
our kind. Should these races learn 
of our source by those such as your- 
self, who are of good intention, 
they too might destroy our race.” 

This explanation seemed to ex- 
plain all except the reason for plac- 
ing us incommunicado. I waited to 
hear the rest. 

“A visit to our home planet is a 
one-way trip,” the Master stated. 
“Also there are certain operations 
which must be performed on your 
brain.” 

When I heard the Master speak 
of this, my first impulse was fear — 
fear that any operation to my brain 
might endanger the very faculties 
which the Master needed to solve his 
problem. I was soon relieved, how- 
ever. 

“We insert a small cartridge of 
explosive at the base of your occipi- 
tal bone. If, by some unusual chance, 
you are fifty miles or further away 
from the surface of our planet, cer- 
tain secret carrier waves will auto- 
matically explode the cartridge.” 

Upon signal from the Master, the 
Personal Attendant brought a rose- 
colored, scented water near to one of 
his orifices. A small amount of the 
water was taken in and discharged. 
Only a slight change in color to the 
eye band could be observed during 
this activity. 

“Oh, yes!” the Master continued. 
“We congratulate you on your suc- 
cessful solution to Vanatta’s prob- 
lem. We are eagerly awaiting similar 
solutions on our planet.” 

I never did receive a completely 
rational reason for our treatment. 
Lacking evidence to the contrary, I

had to add one more to the list of 
characteristics of the Master Race. 
They were frightened, paranoiac 
foims of life! 

XII 

awakening from the operating 
table my compulsion to analyze 
awoke first. But, strangely, I did not 
think of my duty to the Masters. I 
first thought, “How pretty are those 
gray eyes!” 

The surgeon who installed the 
capsule in my brain had pure black 
hair, gray eyes and a beautiful curv- 
ing smile. Her laugh made me laugh, 
and her frowns made me frown. I 
tingled whenever she touched me 
while performing her chores. I be- 
gan to understand about Grammer’s 
feeling toward such “purely heredi- 
tary traits” as eyes, lips and cheeks! 

She was a Surgeon and knew some 
genetics. Within limits, we could 
communicate. With great surprise 
I (found other ways of communicat- 
ing then through manmade symbols. 
She responded to my feelings. And, 
blessed with both Grammer and Surg 
(as I called her), I returned to my 
alloted work with renewed energy. 

My initial view of Ed, the Mas- 
ter’s planet, was by standard track 
car. At Grammer’s suggestion, I 
requested, and got, Surg assigned as 
a member of my research team. 
Surg, Grammer and I arranged for 
a complete planetary review of the 
surface of Ed. 

Always a large assortment of 
extra-Ed life waited upon us. Every- 
where there were life forms per- 
forming personal, technical or ad- 



ministrative duties for the Masters. 
A weird sort of femlike form pla- 
ned our Ed trip. It took the combin- 
ed services of two other communica- 
tor specialists to relay between the 
language of Earth and the language 
of the “fern.” I couldn’t help but 
wonder, why, in this instance, a Mas- 
ter couldn’t perform this chore for 
which they were so well suited? 

Ed turned out to be nothing but 
cubicle after cubicle from pole to 
pole. I had never given it thought 
before, but it was easy to surmise 
where the basic pattern of cubicles 
and track cars had originated. They 
had been exported from Ed to all 
other Master-controlled planets. Yet 
I would still bet that they were not 
original with the Masters. 

There was no obvious advantage 
to be gained from any particular 
location. So we merely selected at 
random and began building the or- 
ganization of supplies and helpers 
that we would need. 

Several weeks after our arrival 
Protectors met us with the request 
to accompany them. Again no ques- 
tions were answered, and we were 
summoned into the Directing Hall 
of Masters. 

The Hall of Masters was not real- 
ly a hall but rather another standard- 
sized cubicle, arranged internally in 
such manner that nearly any sort of 
life form could move in or out 
while waiting on the pleasure of 
the Master. Flexibility seemed to be 
the keynote. Where before I had 
seen os many as ten Masters with 
perhaps ten or fifteen personal at- 
tendants each, here I saw each Mas- 
ter with as many as fifty attendants. 



TO SERVE THE MASTERS 



63 




Since eight governing Masters com- 
prised the ruling body, there were 
perhaps 400 personal attendants 
weaving in and, out or standing about 
waiting for the significant wave of 
an orifice or screened message. 

T he hall became silent as the 
Protectors guided Grammer, 
Surg and myself in. The leading 
spokesman for the Masters was one 
of the most wrinkled balls of gray 
flesh I had yet seen. I supposed that 
this meant that he was a very old 
specimen of his life form. 

I noted the slow motion of his 
dangling orifices as he motioned for 
his Carrier to lower him closer to 
my speaking level. Also, his eye 
band was predominantly ridged in- 
stead of smooth as found in the 
younger Masters, 

Once again I relaxed with pleasure 
under the careful scanning of this 
oldster. He spoke. “Congratulations 
on your success on Vanatta. We ex- 
pect equally successful research from 
you here on Ed. We are the gov- 
erning body of all life, everywhere! 
Our problem has concerned us for 
many ages, and we look forward to 
its solution from you. Can you give 
us an expected date of solution?” 

It was not only The suddenness of 
his question which caused me to 
appear in shock. Here before me 
were the true beneficial rulers of all 
“civilized” space. Here was the rul- 
ing body which made literally thou- 
sands of races live in peace and har- 
mony. By birth and training — in- 
stinctively — I knew I was in the 
presence of the greatest life form 
next to God! 



But, more than that, I was being 
asked to present “near-God” with 
a “date of solution” to His prob- 
lem! I was tongue-tied. Without the 
special scanning ability of the aged 
Master, I never would have recov- 
ered sensibly from the meeting. He 
recognized and immediately re- 
sponded to my communications dif- 
ficulty. 

“You are a specially prepared ser- 
vant of the Masters,” he said. “Your 
job will be done expeditiously, I am 
sure. I am decreeing that, except for 
the direct will of a Master, your 
every wish shall have first priority. 
As you already know, it is impossi- 
ble to continue our planned control 
of space when the volume of space 
increases as the cube of the, radius 
of our expansion, yet Master breed- 
ing increases only as the square of 
the surface of our breeding area — 
now a constant. When you have 
solved our problem for us, we will 
then be able to continue our bene- 
ficial expansion into all of space.” 

He paused long enough to dip the 
tips of each of his eight orifices 
into eight different colored bowls of 
scented water. I was fascinated to 
watch eight different attendants scur- 
ry in and out with the bowls. 

The Master continued. “Even 
though you are a perfectly loyal 
researcher, we feel it necessary to 
charge you with an official state- 
ment as to your duties on our be- 
half. In short, you are hereby in- 
structed — indeed commanded — 
to improve our racer 

I was made completely speech- 
less by such an overriding command, 
especially when it was reinforced by 



64 



IP 




the Master’s ipeculiar scannmg talent. 
I nearly begged to some m^own 
higher being that I ^ould not fail 
this enlarged and personally assign- 
ed, nearly sacred objective! 

XIII 

A pplication of modem technology 
to optimization of the produc- 
tion of Masters here on Ed was 
amazingly efficient. With the ex- 
ception of a small percentage of 
cubicles, all other Ed cubicles con- 
sisted of nearly automated breed- 
ing vats for the Masters. Their 
breeding limitation was approximate- 
ly that of the area of the surface 
of their planet — a square factor 
— since nearly all of the planet 
was covered by breeding vats. 

'Each breeding cubicle consisted 
essentially of a large “swimimiig 
pool” about 12 feet deep. In tne 
pool was a balanced biotic com- 
munity. All n^ssary ingredients for 
supporting Ed’s equivalent of dia- 
toms, algae, amoeba, protozoa and 
other essentia] life forms were pres- 
ent up to, and including, the worm 
fish. Acutally, each form of life was 
there to contribute in its own way a 
necess^ ecological balance, thus 
providing an environment proper for 
the growth of the wormfish. The 
wormfish was the necessary host for 
the Master! 

Each fertile cell of the Master 
contained a single flagellum which 
lay in a fold of the outer mem- 
brane throu^out its length. It form- 
ed an undulating membrane which 
was effective in propelling the tiny 
cell through blood or other body 



fluids. Millions of these fertile cells 
were introduced to the closed ecolo- 
gy supporting the worm fish, and in- 
evitable encounters by the with 
the fish resulted in the supplying of 
a proper host for the Master cdls. 
Each fertile cell found its way to 
the internal organs of the womifish. 
Perhaps two hundred cells could be 
nourished in all. The blood of the 
fish acted as both source of food 
and convenient sewage disposal sys- 
tem. 

Once in the presence of a suitable 
spot, the flagellum changed to a 
rasp^ hook which, once driven into 
several of the wormfish cells, could 
not be easily withdrawn. Hangmg 
by this hook, each fertile Master 
cell 'began its growth and transfor- 
mation. 

First a tight membrane was con- 
structed around itself, impervious to 
all except food of the proper chem- 
ical and physical properties. Second, 
within this membrane, the cell nuc- 
leus began to grow in size. A light 
fiber strand of nerve material ex- 
tended from each chromosomal 
protruberance to form eight rudi- 
mentary pro-tentacles. Other than 
modification of other chromosomal 
materials to form brain tissue and 
a circular, light-sensitive band, the 
only other two major 'growths were 
the development of extremely primi- 
tive muscular tissue and a very prim- 
itive pro-stomach. 

With fourteen days of growth, 
the first fertile cell reaches a kind 
of maturity. The membrane cracks 
open, and the living but miniature 
Master swims out. Through the use 
of its unique scanning sense it im- 



TO SERVE THE MASTERS 



65 




mediately locates and kills every 
Other Master cell hanging from the 
wormfish. The one remaming min- 
iature Master then swims to the ma- 
jor control locations of the worm- 
fish’s brain. Here the Master es- 
tablishes both home and control 
over the activities of the fish, pend- 
ing its further growth. WTien a 
point is finally reached where the 
“tumor” aggravates the host beyond 
its normal biological limits, the Mas- 
ter, with profoimd foresight, ar- 
ranges to be evacuated just prior to 
the death of the host. 

In the new environment consist- 
ing chiefly of water and dissolved 
minerals, the Master finds no com- 
petition for survival. He absorbs 
his nourishment in the same manner 
as before, using water instead of 
blood, and dissolved minerals in- 
stead of more complex food struc- 
tures which were found in the blood. 

No real intelligence is discerned 
in the little Master until it reaches 
sufficient size to store energy mole- 
cules. At this time it instinctively 
leaves its watery environment where 
the servants of the Masters begin 
its formal training — a training pro- 
gram dedicated solely to how to be 
master of the universe! 

I f my assignment were still that 
of increasing the rate of breed- 
ing rather than that of “improving 
the Master race,” I am sure the 
technical difficulties would have 
been elementary. As a matter of fact 
I speculated as to why others had 
not attempted to transplant the 
requisite bio-system on other plan- 
ets in other solar systems. Was it 



their characteristic paranoia which 
prevented them from seeking ob- 
vious solutions? Was it their com- 
plete lack of trust in others, coupled 
with their extremely tight security 
precautions? Or was it simply their 
characteristic self-inflated ego which 
prevented them from viewing them- 
selves from any other viewpoint 
than “special” or “difficult?” 

Whatever the reason, I was thank- 
ful that my Masters had determined 
to expand my role to “improve” 
their race; for, with this more diffi- 
cult assignment, I was sure that 
Grammer, Surg and myself would 
have far more occasion to stay to- 
gether! 

What constitutes “improvement” 
of a race? Certainly, from the 
human point of view, the need for 
companionship, the eternal struggle 
to solve problems and the extreme 
adaptability of our genetic plasma 
to historical change are all plusses. 

But, what about the tremendous 
computing ability of the Antareans 
which contributes to their domin- 
ance in space? Or their stress-free 
exo-skeleton, so cleverly designed to 
compensate for rapid and varied 
changes in gravity? What about the 
long-lived, nearly classic example of 
the adaptability of Earth insects? Or 
the tremendous weapons-forming 
and fighting ability of the Protect- 
ors? Which of the nearly endless 
characteristics possible to life should 
be acquired by our Masters? Which, 
too, of the characteristics now dom- 
inant in the Masters should be re- 
tained and which masked? 

I redoubled our efforts. Even 
though the highest technical skill 



66 



IP 




was ours for the asking, the greatest 
of computer technology was ours 
(for projecting possible characteris- 
tics from change of nucleus to final 
adult life form), the highest of loy- 
alty was ours to our duty, I was 
soon convinced that a Genetic 
genius is not so very bright! It is 
one thing to merely solve a techni- 
cal problem but another thing en- 
tirely to define “best” characteristics 
for the life of a whole race. Espe- 
cially difficult was such choice be- 
cause I knew the Masters were vir- 
tually perfect in themselves. 

It was at this point in my work 
that both Surg and Grammer be- 
came deathly sick. For the first time 
in my young life I realized what it 
was to be alone. At first, however, 
I wasn’t too disturbed. When all 
efforts to find a human Medic on 
Ed proved fruitless, I tried other 
forms of life which might be com- 
petent in this field. When this effort, 
too, failed, I appealed to the Masters. 
Every possible door was opened on 
my behalf. A Medic was found in 
another solar system and brought to 
Ed within forty-eight hours. My re- 
lief proved premature, however! 

O n the third day of the Medic’s 
arrival, he approached me with 
an alien Grammer. “I am terribly 
sorry,” was his message, “but there 
is no knowledge which I have which 
can effect a cure. As a matter of 
fact, I am not the least bit familiar 
with their form of sickness nor its 
cure. I have checked with my col- 
leagues on Earth, and they concur. 
Other than intravenous feeding, 
there is nothing more I can do.” 



My world spun! Never since the 
days of my imprisonment on Vanatta 
for desiring information on the home 
world of the Masters had I ever ex- 
perienced such despondency. I be- 
came alternately despondent and ex- 
uberant. I was not rational. Yet the 
struggle to survive which must lie 
dormant in all human seed awoke 
to push me to greater and greater 
heights of rationalization. I ration- 
alized that since I was only compe- 
tent in the field of genetics, I would 
help in the only way I knew how, 
by applying my knowledge to their 
sickness. This was much like saying 
that since I was an expert bricklayer, 
I would lay bricks, expertly, until 
their sickness was cured! 

I selected samples of both Surg’s 
and Crammer’s cells. Each was in 
a deep coma. I studied the chromo- 
somal materials. The first look made 
me doubt my senses completely. 
“Perhaps,” I thought, “it is only a 
clumsy laboratory error.” Their 
genes were nearly identical. Fur- 
thermore, there were twice too many. 
I selected sample after sample un- 
der the utmost control techniques; 
yet still the analysis was the same. 
About the time that I began to 
doubt the validity of the whole of 
biologic genetics, I too passed into 
unconsciousness ! 

Three weeks later I was told that 
I had fallen over the sick bodies of 
Surg and Grammer, that Surg and 
Grammer had awakened nearly one 
week earlier than I, and that noth- 
ing the Medic had done for any of 
us was of any real help. 

Again an waking my first thought 
was on the beauty of the female of 



68 



IF 




my species. Surg was feeding me 
intravenously. Her first words sur- 
prised me. She said: 

“Good morning, my love! Can 
you discuss the nature of true hypo- 
thalamic replacement or the parsing 
of a verb?” 

My answer surprised me even 
more. I said, “Why, yes, I can!” 
Why was I not tongue-tied? Why 
was I not restricted to thoughts of 
my specialty? For the first time in 
my life I was able to contemplate, 
with ease and imderstanding, subject 
matter not necessarily related to my 
own. It seemed natural to think in 
the areas of medicine or communica- 
tions. Prior to my sickness I could 
discuss subjects only if they be- 
came my own — through disguise, 
deception or actuality. 

Needless to say I was appalled 
at the subjective changes in me. 

I was even more appalled when I 
discovered similar changes in 
Grammer and Surg. We were like 
three school children who have just 
learned that holidays are forthcom- 
ing. Or, better yet, we were like 
three deaf43lindnmutes who have 
suddenly been given the gift of 
hearing, sight and speech. Three 
worlds to explore, each of com- 
fortable fit like homeworld — yet 
each was new, novel and infinite in 
nature! For each of us could un- 
derstand and communicate within 
the framework of one another’s com- 
petence. 

We foresaw the day in the future 
when each of us would become 
Grammer, Surgeon and Genetic 
combined. For now, we were high- 



ly specialized and highly trained^ 
humans with large appetites and new- 
ly bom capacities for learning in 
these allied fields of knowledge. 

Somehow, somewhere, we had 
been improved as individuals. 

Here lay the germ of a clue 
which was sorely needed to perform 
our duties toward our Master. Once 
again we set to work. This time I 
was hot too surprised to find that 
the chromosomal material from 
cells of each of us were very similar 
and represented three times as many 
as normal. Here was an obvious 
source of our change. Through 
screening by Masters each of us was 
the product of extremely fine selec- 
tion for attributes desired by the 
Masters. The very process of this 
fine screening caused each of us to 
be ‘^se idiots,” since genetic 
characteristics necessary for cross- 
communication amongst ourselves 
were lost Yet, obviously, any race 
like the human would consider such 
a characteristic as the ability to 
understand one another as basic. 
Now, through some yet to be de- 
ciphered fluke related to our joint 
illness, we had (become hybridized 
so that gene material of each was 
found in the cfeUs of each. Our cyto- 
plasmic tissue was capable of re- 
sponding to the joint, yet integrated, 
directions from each new nucleus. 
We had become, through accident, 
a hybridized polyploid! 

Sometimes gametes possess a dip- 
loid instead of the usual haploid 
number in some cases even three, 
four or five extra sets. Organisms 
possessing more than the diploid 
number are called polyploids. They 



TO SERVE THE MASTERS 




may be larger and more vigorous 
tiban the usual diploid, hence poly- 
ploids are often deliberately gener- 
ated — especially in the plant world. 
Polyploid flowers are usually larger 
than normal ones. Very little was 
known about polyploidy in animals, 
probably because it occurred so in- 
frequently. We were a living ex- 
ample of the possibility of induced 
heterokaiyonization within the same 
species! 

The three of us, now working to- 
gether as a nearly perfect function- 
ing research team, soon traced the 
source of our strange infection to 
viral matter which had followed us 
from Vanatta. The very same viral 
material which caused the dissolv- 
ing membrane of Vanatta cells, thus 
opening »a cellular door for other 
nuclei and consequent heterokary- 
onization, had followed us to Ed. 
Here, we three had unconsciously 
exposed ourselves to it, each pro- 
viding the cellular material neces- 
sary for its first performance on 
Ed. 

Once the agent of our illness was 
identified, we easily cultured the 
virus in a protect^ environment 
while taking the precaution to ster- 
ilize everything elsa Once again 
we set to work on the problem posed 
us by the head of the Master Race 
— to improve the Masters! 

XIV 

I soon realized that my former 
“wise idiot” capability, no mat- 
ter how technologically perfect, nor 
how logically accurate, was the 
wrong, avenue of approach for “im- 



proving” the Master Race. Only on 
a philosophical plane would their 
ends be met. Certainly life which 
was so successful that it was the 
“master” of aH within its bio^)here 
was already “improved.” For if the 
basic “to survive” were the (Mily 
criterion for life, the Master Race 
had met this god on its first trial. 
Its second trial of life had yet to 
be offered! 

However, it took no genetic gen- 
ius to realize that capacity to adapt 
was almost nil in the Master Race. 
Further improvement was needed 
in that direction. Secondly, Masters 
needed hundreds of thousands of 
supporting life forms merely to al- 
low them to be comfortable. Addi- 
tional billions — perhaps more — 
were destroyed just to insure their 
dominance. Was this economical for 
either Masters or nature? Perhaps 
this could be a second direction for 
improvement. Finally, in spite of 
the tremendous gift which nature 
had bestowed to the Masters — the 
gift to know one’s “neighbor” as 
well as oneself — the Master re- 
mained an unsocial form of life. 
Whatever improvements were made 
must take this into account. 

Both the means and the coded 
improvement goals were scientifical- 
ly prepared for completion of our 
assignment. I prepared large quanti- 
ties of Vanatta’s special hybridizing 
virus while Surg and Grammer 
sought for, and received, some rare 
human protoplasm which had been 
laboratory-grown prior to Earth’s 
first visit by the Master Race. No 
screening had pre-selected genetic 
materials from this tissue culture. 



70 



IF 




Probably it was the only human 
protoplasm in existence for which 
this could be sauL 

Now the wotk became one of 
straight genetic engineering. Jmt 
prior to the introduction of fertile 
Master cells to their breeding tanks, 
I mixed the Vanatta viral material 
as wdl as growths of human proto- 
pilasm. As was to be expected, each 
fertile cell wall dissolved at its point 
of contact with the attenuated viral 
material, and, as a consequence, each 
human cell introduced its nucleus 
in the fertile cell. 1 didn’t expect a 
human cell to exist under the pend- 
ing environment, therefore those 
cells which received the nucleus of 
the Master cell were unimportant. 

The newly hybridized cells were 
then dumped into each breeding vat 
where, hopefully, a new kind of be- 
havior would ensue. Fortunately 
most of the equipment was auto- 
mated planetwide, and we could ac- 
complish the whole job in a reason- 
ably short time. 

Our second phase began with the 
identification and treatment of all 
nutrients used by the Masters. Since 
this consisted of only eight colors 
of water saturated with different 
mixtures of anions and cations re- 
quired for sustaining Master meta- 
bolism, we found no obstacle in 
adding our hybridizing mixture. 

Our third phase consisted of pre- 
paring and shipping small packages 
of this same mixture along with 
proper instructions for its intro- 
duction to Master nutrients every- 
where. The Protectors and their 
ships began a continuous work shift 
so that each Master got his share. 



Our work was done. There re- 
mained only the clerical task of 
following up on the predicted pro- 
gress of ^e great racial improvement 
program. ^ 

Perhaps our lifetime would not 
see its end. But I was sure that 
someone among my distant de- 
scendants would know its end — 
and remember its beginning. For I 
was determined to leave sufficient 
notes so that posterity would know 
what to look for as well as to ex- 
plain why so many different life 
forms are scattered throughout such 
a large volume of space. 

XV 

1 am sure that the complete obedi- 
ence of all live forms within the 
biosphere of the Masters, as well 
as the tremendous efficiency with 
which each form served the Master, 
combined to enable us to rapidly 
service everyone of the Master Race. 
I wasn’t too sure of the end results 
in the case of adult hybridizing of 
human characteristics with Master 
characteristics. Here early training 
as well as pre-conditioning of intel- 
lect served to mask biological pre- 
dictions. 

We first observed the actual re- 
sults on Ed; 

A coma occurred for each Mas- 
ter just as with Grammer, Surg and 
myself. 1 had selected human charac- 
teristics long known to be domin- 
ant in hiding psi phenomena. These 
organelles served effectively to hide 
the ability of each Master to screen. 
1 reasoned that the very characteris- 
tic which most contributed to the 



TO SERVE THE AUSTERS 



71 




successful domination of otlier life 
forms was also the same chamacter- 
istic which prevented Masters from 
improving their race. For, without 
ability to screen, need arose to seek 
out other solutions to survival prob- 
lems. With need for other solutions 
to survival came opportunity for 
adaptation of successful mutations. 
With adaptation of successful mu- 
tations came “improvement.” And 
I was sure that “improvement” 
could only be measured in terms 
of successful capacity to adapt to 
current needs. 

This, then, in simple form was 
my chief reason for hybredizing un- 
differentiated, unscreened, human 
protoplasm with Master protoplasm. 

In the case of the adult Master, 
each responded in a similar manner 
once their screening mechanism was 
gone and consciousness returned. 
Each would roll into a small ball 
and shiver endlessly. Often its ten- 
tacles would combine together and 
form a hook which was repeatedly 
stabbed into the air. It appeared 
to be a complete regression back 
to its parasitic existence within the 
wormfish. 

I wasn’t too concerned with this 
part of the experiment, however. No 
Master would die and all would con- 
tinue to be taken care of as long 
as they lived. Surely disorganization 
would take place in the Master’s 
biosphere due to lack of a com- 
manding head, but mostly the Mas- 
ters would be cared for after chang- 
es as well as they were before the 
change. 

There was always the chance that 
the Master would overcome his early 



conditioning and training and find 
some accommodation with his hu- 
man counterpart — thus giving each 
Master the pleasure of empathy for 
one’s own Mnd as well as all of life. 

Since our orders were to be 
obeyed by all Ed’s life, and since 
Ed was the headquarters for Mas- 
ter civilization, we were, to all in- 
tents and purposes, the sole rulers 
of a galaxy which would soon be 
in serious trouble for lack of its 
main force of cohesion. This lack of 
“integrated kingdom” seemed like 
a hi^ price to pay for improvement 
of the Master. In the long run — 
many generations hence — we 
would know. 

The first major departure from 
normal behavior by the tiny Master 
cell, clinging within the blood sys- 
tem of the wormfish, was soon ob- 
served. Instead of killing all other 
Master cells not yet hatched from 
the protective cocoon, it directed 
itself immediately to tihe nerve con- 
trol structure of the fisih. Each 
Master unit, in turn, behaved the 
same. Such confused multiple con- 
trol of operations within the worm- 
fish caused the Master to leave the 
fish at an earlier age. All scanning 
abilities were gone. But the pro- 
portion of surviving Master cells 
was now many where there had been 
but one. So many living in the same 
closed bio-system caused greater con- 
flict for nourishment. This greater 
conflict, actually the first conflict 
to which the Master Race had ever 
been exposed, resulted in the first 
opportunity-step on the evolutionary 
ladder. Whether its problems would 
be solved by organized family units

IF 




versus the environment, by strongs 
Duan nile, by development of keener 
brains — or whether the problems 
would be ^‘solved” by succumbing 
to them — would be evident only in 
some far distant future. 

This, I was sure, was the only 
reasonable answer to my Masters 
command to improve their race! I 
had succeeded in giving them a 
problem to solve at the microscopic 
level of existence. 1 had also suc- 
ceeded in temporizing their feel- 
ings toward other life by introduc- 
ing genes of the one race having 
the greatest affinity for other life 
— my human race! 

A s rulers behind the rulers, Gram- 
mer, Surg and I were able to 
complete the cleanup work without 
happenstance. Although all forms of 
life were quite concerned about the 
Master “sickness,” as it became mis- 
named, none would voluntarily inter- 
fere with their Master’s prior com- 
mand which placed our desires 
ahead of all else unless directly 
countermanded by a Master. Pro- 
tectors continued to protect the 
“sick” Masters. Grammers contin- 
ued to aid in interpreting meanings. 
Medics and researchers continued 
their functions. Bred and trained 
for duties under complete loyalty 
to the will of the Master, none were 
other than docile imder the emerg- 
ing emergency. We knew, though, 
that it would not be long before the 
lack of specific guidance from the 
Master Race would soon lead to 
complete chaos. It was not our In- 
tent to wait out this chaos on the 
planet Ed. 



My Job was done. I could no 
longer serve my Masters until and if, 
in the far distant, unpredictable 
future, the Master should overcome 
his evolutionary obstacles. As I well 
knew, the likelihood of this hap- 
pening was very remote. For every 
successful race which reaches the 
stars there are perhaps a billion or 
so which succumb along the way. 
Yet, in the final analysis, there 
could be no other way! Regardless 
of the postulates which are known 
to be true for bio^molecular engin- 
eering, the universe of reality proves 
always and ever larger. No ultimate 
intelligence would ever reach such 
wisdom or size that it could create 
my mental construct and symboUsm 
— the tools of science — complete 
and accurate pictures of any part of 
reality. This right belongs to a 
Supreme Being only! 

So I did, in my compassion and 
love for the Master Race, only what 
could be done to satisfy their com- 
mand. I started them again on the 
long evolutionary road of trial and 
error — but with a difference. 

This time they had a “human” 
helper along the way. One who had 
already been over the path and 
found it successfully. Who knows? 
Perhaps their chances are far bet- 
ter than my feeble science can pre- 
dict! 

With these thoughts in mind, I 
prepared for our departure. We re- 
moved the buried explosives from 
our bodies and turned off the sig- 
nal which could trigger the device 
at fifty miles up. No longer bound 
by need to twist and torture our 
thoughts through other persons for

minor gains in communications, we 
sougiht out and selected a planet 
which was ^arthlike in many ways. 
It was already seeded with a small 
human colony at technological level 
one. We planned to ride out the 
forthcoming chaos there. 

Privately Surg and I were hope- 
ful that Grammer could and would 
find another human female as a 
“soulmaite.” We all three determined 
to continue our research activities 
as a team. With all of the future 
ahead of us, and nothing left to 
serve hut our own whims — with 
only a twinge of regret for our 
Masters — how truly glorious that 
future appeared! Should we tackle 



the problems of longevity, thus mak- 
ing the future ours too? Or perhaps 
the problems of psi functions, re- 
moving the masking elements from 
the genetic structures of all intelli- 
gent species, thus opening a door to 
multispecies unity? 

With our increased capacity for 
successful ibehavior in allied fields 
as well as our new knowledge of 
heterokaryonization we felt equal to 
the tasks. 

Surg and I, however, had our own 
private set of goals. And within it, 
I hoped our first child would have 
Surges eyes and hair color — pure- 
ly hereditary as they may be!

The statue sang. What's 
worse, it wouldn't stop! 



I 

ow notes on a high aCtemoon. 
As we drove aiway after the un- 
veiling my secretary said: “Mr. 
Hamilton, I suppose you realize what 
a fool you’ve made of yourself?” 
“Don’t sound so piim,” I told her. 
“How was I to know Lorraine 
Drexel would produce something 
Vke that?” 

*Tive thousand dollars,** she said 
reflectively. “It’s nothing but a piece 
of old scrap iron. And the noise! 
Didn’t you look at her sketches? 
What’s the Fine Arts Committee 
for?” 



My secretaries have always talked 
to me like this, and just then I could 
imderstand why. I stopped the car 
imder the trees at the end of the 
square and looked back. The chairs 
had been cleared away and already 
a small crowd had gathered around 
the statue, staring up at it curiously. 
A couple of tourists were banging 
one of the struts, and the thin metal 
skeleton shuddered weakly. Despite 
this, a monotonous and highpitched 
wailing sounded out from the statue 
across the pleasant morning air, 
grating the teeth of passers-^by. 

“Raymond Mayo is having it dis- 
mantled this afternoon,’’ I said. “If

it hasn’t already been done for us. 
I wondier where Miss Drexel is?” 
“Don’t worry, you won’t see her 
in Vennilion Sands again. I bet she’s 
halfway to Red Beach by now.” 

I patted Carol on the shoulder. 
“Relax. You looked beautiful in your 
new skirt. The Medicis probably 
felt like this about Michelangelo. 
Who are we to judge?” 

“Tom are,” she said. “You were 
on the committee, weren’t you?” 
“Darling,” I explained patiently. 
“Sonic sculpture is the thing. You’re 
trying to fight a battle the public 
lost -thirty years ago.” 

W e drove back to my office in a 
thin silence. Carol was annoy- 
ed because she had been forced to 
sit beside me on the platform when 
the audience began to heckle my 
speech at the unveiling, but even so 
the morning had been disastrous on 
every count. What might be perfectly 
acceptable at Expo 67 or the Venice 
Biennale was all too obviously passe 
at Vermilion Sands. 

When we had decided to commis- 
sion a sonic sculpture for the square 
in the center of Vermilion Sands, 
Raymond Mayo and I had agreed 
that we should patronize a local 
artist. There were dozens of pro- 
fessional sculptors in Vermilion 
Sands, but only three had deigned 
to present themselves before the 
committee. 

The first two whom we saw 
were large, bearded men with enor- 
mous fists and impossible schemes 
— one for a 100-foothigh vibrating 
aluminum pylon, and the other for 
a vast boonaing family group that 



involved over fifteen tons of basalt 
mounted on a megalithic step^yra- 
mid. Each had taken an hour to be 
argued out of the committee room. 

The third was a woman: Lorraine 
Drexel. This elegant and autocratic 
creature in a cartwheel hat, with 
her eyes like black orchids, was a 
sometime model and intimate of 
Giacometti and John Cage. Wearing 
a blue crepe de Chine dress orna- 
mented with lace serpents and other 
art nouveau emblems, she sat before 
us like some fugitive Salome from 
the world of Aubrey Beardsley. Her 
immense eyes regarded us with an 
almost hypnotic calm, as if she had 
discovered that very moment some 
unique quality in these two amiable 
dilettantes of the Fine Arts Com- 
mittee. 

She had lived in Vermilion Sands 
for only three months, arriving via 
Berlin, Calcutta and the Chicago 
New Arts Center. Most of her sculp- 
ture to date had been scored for 
various Tantric and Hindu hymns, 
and I remembered her brief affair 
with a world-famous pop-singer, 
later killed in a car crash, who had 
been an enthusiastic devotee of the 
sitar. 

At the time, however, we had 
given no thought to the whining 
quarter-tones of this infernal instru- 
ment, so grating on the Western ear. 
She had shown us an album of her 
sculptures, interesting chromium con- 
structions that compared favorably 
with the run of illustrations in the 
latest art magazines; but I was look- 
ing only at her huge hieratic eyes. 
Within half an hour we had drawn 
up a contract.

IF 




I saiw the statue for the first time 
that afternoon, thirty seconds be- 
fore 1 started my speech to the spe- 
cially selected assembly of Vermilion 
Sands notables. Why none of us had 
bothered to look at it beforehand 1 
fail to understand. The. title printed 
on the invitation cards — Sound and 
Quantum: Generative Synthesis 3 — 
had seemed a little odd, and the 
general shape of the shrouded statue 
even more suspicious. I was expect- 
ing a stylized human figure, but the 
structure under the acoustic drapes 
had the proportions of a medium- 
sized radar aerial. However, Lor- 
raine Drexel sat beside me on the 
stand, her bland eyes surveying the 
crowd below. A dreamlike smile 
gave her the look of a tamed Mona 
Lisa. 

What we saw after Raymond 
Mayo pulled the tape I tried not to 
think about. 

With its pedestal the statue was 
twelve feet high. Three spindly 
metal legs, ornamented with spikes 
and crosspieces, reached up from 
the plinth to a triangular apex. 
Clamped onto this was a jagged 
structure that at first sight seemed 
to be an old Buick radiator grille. 
It had been bent into a rough U 
five feet across, and the two arms 
jutted out horizontally, a single row 
of sonic cores, each about a foot 
long, poking up like the teeth of an 
enormous comb. Welded on ap- 
parently at random all over the 
statue were twenty or thirty filigree 
vanes. 

That was all. The whole structure 
of scratched chromium had a blight- 
ed look, like a derelict TV antenna. 



Startled a little by the first shrill 
whoops emitted by the statue, I be- 
gan my speech and was about half- 
way through when I noticed that 
Lorraine Drexel had left her seat 
beside me. People in the audience 
were beginning to stand up and 
cover ttheir ears, shouting to Ray- 
mond to replace the acoustic drape. 
A bat sailed through the air over my 
head and landed neatly on one of 
the sonic cores. The statue was now 
giving out an intermittent high-pitch- 
ed whine, a sitarlike caterwauling 
that seemed to pull apart the sutures 
of my skull. Responding to the boos 
and protests, it suddenly began to 
whoop erratically, the hornlike 
sounds confusing the traffic on the 
far side of the square. 

As the audience began to leave 
their seats en masse, I stuttered in- 
audibly to the end of my speech, 
the wiOing of the statue interrupted 
by shouts and jeers. Then Carol 
tugged me sharply by the arm, her 
eyes flashing. Raymond Mayo point- 
ed with a nervous hand. 

The three of us were now alone 
on the platfonn, the rows of over- 
turned chairs reaching across the 
square. Standing twenty yards from 
the statue, which had now begun 
to whimper plaintively, was Lorraine 
Drexel. I expected to see a look of 
fury and outrage on her face, but 
instead her unmoving eyes showed 
the calm and implacable contempt 
of a grieving widow insulted at her 
husband’s funeral. As we waited 
awkwardly, watching the wind carry 
away the last program cards, she 
turned on a diamond heel and walk- 
ed across the square.

n 

N o one else wanitied anylMng to 
do with the stattue, so 1 was fi- 
nally presented with il Lorraine 
Drexel left Vermilion Sands the day 
it was dismantled. Raymond spoke 
briefly to iher on the telephone be- 
fore she went. I presumed she would 
be rather unpleasant (and didn’t 
bother to Msten in on the extension. 

‘Well?” I asked. “Does she want 
it back?” 

“No.” Raymond seemed slightly 
preoccupied. “She said it belonged 
to us.” 

“You and me?” 

“Everybody.” Raymond helped 
himself to the decanter of Scotch 
on the veranda table. “Then she 
started laughing.” 

“Good. What at?” 

“I don’t know. She just said that 
we’d grow to like it.” 

There was nowhere else to put the 
statue so I planted it out in the gar- 
den. Without the stone pedestal it 
was only six feet high. Shielded by 
the shrubbery, it bad quieted down 
and now emitted a pleasant melodic 
harmony, its soft rondos warbling 
across the afternoon heat. The sitar- 
like twangs, which the statue had 
broadcast in the square like some 
pathetic love call from Lorraine 
Drexel to her dead lover, had van- 
ished completely, almost as if the 
statue had be^ rescored. 1 had 
been so stampeded by the disastrous 
unveiling that I bad had little chance 
to see it, and I thought it looked a 
lot better in the garden than it had 
done in Vermilion Sands, the chrom- 
ium struts and abstract shapes stand- 



ing out against the desert like some- 
thing in a vodka advertisement. 
After a few days I could almost 
ignore it. 

A week or so later we were out on 
the terrace after lunch, loung- 
ing back in the deck chairs. I was 
nearly asleep when Carol said: 

“Mr. Hamilton, I think it’s mov- 
ing.” 

“What’s moving?” 

Carol was sitting up, head cocked 
to one side. “The statue. It looks dif- 
ferent.” 

I focused my eyes on the statue 
twenty feet away. The radiator grille 
at the top had canted round slightly, 
but the three stems still seemed more 
or less upright. 

“The rain last night must have 
softened the ground,” I said. I listen- 
ed to the quiet melodies carried on 
the warm eddies of air and then lay 
back drowsily. I heard Carol light 
a cigarette with four matches and 
walk across the veranda. 

When I woke in an hour’s time 
she was sitting straight up in the 
deck chair, a frown creasing her 
forehead. 

“Swallowed a bee?” I asked. “You 
look worried.” 

Then something caught my eye. 
I watched the statue for a moment. 
“You’re right. It is moving.” 

Carol nodded. The statue’s shape 
had altered perceptibly. The grille 
had spread into an open gondola 
whose sonic cores seemed to feel at 
the sky, and the three stem-pieces 
were wider apart. AH the angles 
seemed different. 

‘T thought you’d notice it even-

tually,” Carol said as we walked 
over to it “What’s it made of?” 

“Wrought iron — I think, Hiere 
must be a lot of copper or lead in 
it The heat is making it sag.” 

“Then why is it sagging upward 
instead of down?” 

1 touched one of the shoulder 
struts. It was springing elastically as 
the air moved across the vanes and 
went on vibrating against my palm. 
1 gripx>ed it in both hands and tried 
to keep it rigid. A low but discern- 
ible pulse pumped steadily against 
me. 

I backed away from it wiping 
(the flaking chrome off my hands. 
The Mozartian harmonies had gone, 
and the statue was now producing a 
series of low Mahler-like chords. As 
Carol stood there in her bare feet I 
remembered that the height specifi- 
cation we had given to Lorraine 
Drexel had been exactly two meters. 
But the statue was a good three feet 
higher than Carol, the gondola at 
least six or seven across. The spars 
and struts looked thicker and strong- 
er. 

“Carol,” I said. “Get me a file, 
would you? There are some in the 
garage.” 

She came back with two files and 
a hacksaw. 

“Are you going to cut it down?” 
she asked hopefully. 

“Darling, this is on original 
Drexel.” I took one of the files. “I 
just want to convince myself that 
I’m not going insane.” 

I started cutting a series of small 
notches all over the statue, making 
sure they were exactly the width of 
the file apart. The metal was soft 



and worked easily; on the surface 
there was a lot of rust but under- 
neath it had a bright sappy glint. 

“All right,” I said when I tiad 
finished. “Let’s go and have a drink.” 

We sat on the veranda and waited. 
I fixed my eyes on the statue and 
could have sworn that it didn’t move. 
But when we went back an hour 
later the gondola had swung rigjit 
roimd again, hanging down over us 
like an immense metal mouth. 

There was no need to check the 
notch intervals against the file. They 
were all at least double the original 
distance apart. 

“Mr. Hamilton,” Carol said. 
“Look at this.” 

She pointed to one of the spikes. 
Poking through the outer scale of 
chrome were a series of sharp little 
nipples. One or two were already 
beginning to hollow themselves. Un- 
mistakably they were incipient sonic 
cores. 

Carefully 1 examined the rest of 
the statue. All over it new sftioots 
of metal were coming through: 
arches, barbs, sharp double helixes, 
twisting the original statue into a 
thicker and more elaborate constnic- 
tion. A medley of half-familiar 
sounds, fragments of a dozen over- 
tures and symphonies, murmured 
all over it. The statue was well over 
twelve feet high. I fek one of the 
heavy struts, and the pulse was 
stronger, beating steadily ithrough 
the metal, as if it were thrusting it- 
self on to the sound of its own 
music. 

Carol was, watching me with a 
pinched and worried Hook. 

“Relax,” I said. “It’s growing.”

We went back to tlhe veranda and 
watdhed. 

By six o’clock that evening it was 
the size of a small tree. A spirited 
simultaneous rendering of Brahms’s 
Academic Festival Overture and 
Rachmaninoff’s First Piano Concer- 
to trumpeted across the garden. 

Ill 

44rj-ihe strangest thing about it,” 

' A Raymond said the next 
morning, raising his voice above the 
din, “is that it’s still a Drexel.” 

“Still a piece of sculpture, you 
mean?” 

“More than that. Take any sec- 
tion of it and you’ll find the original 
motifs being repeated. Each vane, 
each heMx has all the authentic 
Drexd mannerisms, almost as if ^e 
herself were shaping it Admittedly, 
this penchant for the late Romantic 
composers is a little out of keeping 
with ah that sitar twanging, but that’s 
rather a good thing, if you ask me. 
You can probably expect to hear 
some Beethoven any moment now 
— the Pastoral Symphony, I would 
guess.” 

“Not to mention all five piano 
concertos — played at once,” I 
said sourly. Raymond’s loquacious 
delight in this musical monster out 
in the garden annoyed me. I closed 
the veranda windows, wishing that 
he himself had installed the statue in 
the living room of his downtown 
apartment. “I take it that it won’t 
go on growing forever?” 

Carol handed Ra^ond another 
Scotch. “What do you think we 
ought to do?” 



Raymond shrugged. “Why worry?” 
he said airily. “When it starts tear- 
ing the house down cut it back. 
Thank God we had it dismantled. If 
this had happened in Vermilion 
Sands . ” 

Carol touched my arm. “Mr. 
Hamilton, perhaps that’s what Lor- 
raine Drexel expected. She wanted 
it to start spreading all over the 
town, the music driving everyone 
crazy — ” 

“Careful,” I warned her. “You’re 
running away with yourself. As 
Raymond says, we can chop it up 
any time we want to and melt the 
whole thing down.” 

“Why don’t you, then?” 

“I want to see how far it’ll go,” I 
said. In fact my motives were more 
mixed. Clearly, before she left, Lor- 
raine Drexel had set some perverse 
jinx at work within the statue, a 
bizarre revenge on us all for de- 
riding her handiwork. As Raymond 
had said, the present babel of sym- 
phonic music had no connection with 
the melancholy cries the statue had 
first emitted. Had those forlorn 
chords been intended to be a re- 
quiem for her dead lover — or 
even, conceivably, the beckoning 
calls of a stdl unsurrendered heart? 
Whatever her motives, they had now 
vanished into this strange travesty 
lying across my garden. 

I watched the statue reaching slow- 
ly across the lawn. It had col- 
lapsed under its own weight and lay 
on its side in a huge angular spiral, 
twenty feet long and about fifteen 
feet high, like the skeleton of a fu- 
turistic whale. Fragments of the Nut-

IF 




cracker Suite and Mendelssohn’s 
Italian Symphony sounded from it, 
overlaid by sudden blaring excerpts 
from the closing movement of 
Grieg’s Piano Concerto. The selec- 
tion of these hack classics seemed 
deli'berately designed to get on my 
nerves. 

I had been up with the statue 
most of the night. After Carol went 
to bed, I drove my car, with Ray- 
mond, onto the strip of lawn next to 
the house and turned on the head- 
lamps. The statue stood out almost 
lummousiy in the darkness, booming 
away to itself, more and more of 
the sonic cores budding out in the 
yellow glare of the lights. Gradually 
it lost its original shape; the toothed 
grills enveloped itself and then put 
out new struts and barbs that spiraled 
upward, each throwing off secon- 
dary and tertiary shoots in its turn. 
Shortly after midnight it began to 
lean and then suddenly toppled over. 

By now its movement was cock- 
screw. The plinth had been carried 
into the air and hung somewhere 
in the middle of the tangle, revolv- 
ing slowly, and the main foci of ac- 
tivity were at either end. The growth 
rate was accelerating. We watched 
a new shoot emerge. As one of the 
struts curved round a small knob 
poked through the flaking chrome. 
Within a minute it grew into a spur 
an inch long, thickened, began to 
curve and five minutes later had de- 
veloped into a full-throated sonic 
core twelve inches long. 

Raymond pointed to two of my 
neighbors standing on -the roof of 
their houses a hundred yards away, 
alerted by the music carried across 



to them. “You’ll soon have everyone 
in Vermilion Sands out here. If I 
were you, I’d throw an acoustic drape 
over it.” 

“If I could find one of the size 
of a tennis court. It’s time we did 
something, anyway. See if you can 
trace Lorraine Drexel. I’m going 
to find out what makes this statue 
go.” 

U sing the hacksaw, I cut off a 
two-foot limb and handed it 
to Dr. Blackett, an eccentric but 
amiable neighbor who sometimes 
dabbled in sculpture himself. We 
walked back to the comparative 
quiet of the veranda. The single 
sonic cord emitted a few random 
notes, fragments from a quartet by 
Webern. 

“What do you make of it?” 
“Remarkable,” Blackett said. He 
bent the bar between his hands. “Al- 
most plastic.” He looked back at 
the statue. “Definite drcumuta- 
tion there. Probably phototropic as 
well. Mhm, almost like a plant.” 
“Is it aUve?” 

Beckett laughed. “My dear Hamil- 
ton, of course not. How can it be?” 
“Well, where is it getting its new 
material? From the groimd?” 
“From the air. I don’t know yet, 
but I imagine it’s rapidly synthesiz- 
ing an allotropic form of ferrous 
oxide. In other words, a purely 
physical rearrangement of the con- 
stituents of rust.” Blackett stroked 
his heavy brush moustache and 
stared at the statue with a dream- 
like eye. “Musically, it’s rather 
curious — an appalling congjomera- 
tion of almost every bad note ever

composed* Somewiieire the staitue 
must have suffered some severe 
sonic trauma. It’s behaving as if it 
had been left for a week in a railroad 
shunting yard. Any idea what hap- 
pened?” 

“Not really.” I avoided his gjance 
as we walked back to the statue. It 
seemed to sense us coming and be- 
gan to trumpet out the opening bars 
of Elgar’s Pomp and Circumstance 
march. Deliberately breaking step, I 
said to Blackett: “So in fact all I 
have to do to silence the thing is 
chop it up into two-foot lengths?” 

“If it worries you. However, it 
would be interesting to leave it, as- 
suming you can stand the noise. 
There’s absolutely no danger of it 
going on indefinitely.” He reached 
up and felt one of the spars. “Still 
firm, but I’d say it was almost there. 
It will soon start getting pulpy like 
an over-iipe fruit and begin to shred 
off and disintegrate, playing itself 
out, one hopes, with Mozart’s 
Requiem and the finale of the Goet’- 
terdammerungJ* He smiled at me, 
showing his strange teeth. “Die, if 
you pref^ it.” 

However, he had reckoned com- 
pletely without Lorraine Drexel.

A t six o’clock the next morning I 
was woken by the noise. The 
statue was now fifty feet long and 
crossing the flower beds on efther 
side of the garden. It sounded as if 
a complete orchestra were perform- 
ing some Mad Hatter’s symphony 
out. in the center of the lawn. At 
the far end, by the rockery, the 



sonic cores were still working their 
way through the Romantic catalogue, 
a babel of Mendelssohn, Schubert 
and Grieg, but near the veranda the 
cores were beginning to emit the 
jarring and syncopated rhythms of 
Stravinsky and Stockhausen. 

I woke Carol, and we ate a ner- 
vous breakfast. 

“Mr. HamiltonI” she shouted. 
“You’ve got to stop it!” The nearest 
tendiils were only five feet from 
the glass doors of the veranda. The 
largest limbs were over three inches 
in diameter, and the pulse thudded 
through them like water under pres- 
sure in a fire hose. 

When the first police oars cruised 
past down the road, I went into the 
garage and found the hacksaw. 

The metal was soft, and the blade 
sank through it quickly. I left the 
pieces I cut off in a heap to one 
side, random notes sounding out 
into the air. Separated from the 
main body of the statue, the frag- 
ments were almost inactive, as Dr. 
Blackett had stated. By two o’clock 
that afternoon I had cut back about 
half the statue and got it down to 
manageable proportions. 

“That should hold it,” I said to 
Carol. I walked round and lopped 
off a few of the noisier spars. ‘To- 
morrow I’ll finish it off altogether.” 

I wasn’t in the least surprised 
when Raymond called and said that 
there was no trace anywhere of Lor- 
raine Drexel. 

A t two o’clock that night I woke 
as a window burst across the 
floor oif my bedroom. A huge metal 
helix hovered like a claw through 



82 



IP 




the fractured pane, its sonic core 
screaming down at me. 

A ihalf-moon was up, throwing a 
thin gray light over the garden. Tlie 
statue had sprung hack and was 
twice as large as it had been at its 
peak the previous morning. It lay 
all over the garden in a tangled 
mesh, like the skeleton of a crushed 
building. Already the advance ten- 
drils had reached the bedroom win- 
dows, while others had climbed over 
the garage and were sprouting down- 
ward through the roof, tearing away 
the galvanized metal ^eets. 

All over the statue thousands of 
sonic cores gleamed in the light 
thrown down from the window. At 
last in unison, they hymned out the 
finale of Bruckner’s Apocalyptic 
Symphony. 

I went into Carol’s bedroom, 
fortunately on the other side of the 
house, a^ made her promise to 
stay in bed. Then I telephoned Ray- 
moiKl Mayo. He came round within 
an hour, an oxy-^cetylene torch and 
cylmders he had begged from a local 
contractor in the back seat of his 
car. 

The statue was growing almost as 
fast as we could cut it back, but by 
the time the first light came up at 
a quarter to six we had beaten it 

D r. Blackett watched us slice 
through the last fragments of 
the statue. “There’s a section down 
in the rockery that might just be 
audible. I think it would be worth 
saving.” 

I wiped the rust-«tained sweat 
from my face and shook my head. 
“No. I’m sorry, but once is enough.” 



Blackett nodded in sympathy, and 
stared gloomily across the heaps^ of 
scrap iron wldch were all th^ re- 
mained of the statue. 

Carol, looking a little stunned by 
everyithing, was pouring coffee and 
brandy. As we slumped back in two 
of the deck chairs, arms and faces 
black with rust and metal filings, I 
reflected wryly that no one could 
accuse the Fine Arts Committee of 
not devoting itself wholeheartedly 
to its projects. 

I went off on a final tour of the 
garden, collecting the section Black- 
ett had mentioned, then guided in 
the local contractor who had arrived 
with his truck. It took him and his 
two men an hour to load the scrap 
— an estimated ton and a half — 
into the vehicle. 

“What do I do with it?” he asked 
as he climbed into the cab. “Take 
it to the museum?” 

“No!” I almost screamed. “Get 
rid of it. Bury it somewhere, or b^- 
ter still, have it melted down. As 
soon as possible.” 

When they had gone Blackett and 
I walked round the garden together. 
It looked as if a shrapnel shell had 
exploded over it. Huge divots were 
strewn all over the place, and what 
grass that had not been ripped up 
by the statue had been tramped away 
by us. Iron filings lay on the lawn 
like dust, a faint ripple of lost notes 
oarried away on the steepening sun- 
light. 

Blackett bent down and scooped 
up a handful of grains. “Dragon’s 
teeth. You’ll look out of the window 
tomorrow and see the B Minor Mass 
coming up.” He let it run out be- 



VENUS SMILES

tween his fingers. “However, I sup- 
pose tihat’s tlhe end of it.” 

He couldn’t have been more 
wrong. 

L onmne Drexel sued us. She 
must have come across the 
newspaper reports and realized her 
opportunity. I don’t know where she 
had been hiding, but her lawyers 
materialized quickly enough, waving 
the original contract and pointing 
to the clause in which we guaran- 
teed to protect the statue from any 
damage that might be done to it by 
vandals, livestock or other public 
nuisance. Her main accusation con- 
cerned the damage we had done to 
her reputation — if we had decided 
not to exhibit the statue we should 
have supervised its removal to some 
place of safekeeping, not openly dis- 
menlbered it and then sold off the 
fragments to a scrap dealer. This 
deliberate affront had, her lawyers 
insisted, cost her commissions to a 
total of at least fifty thousand dol- 
lars. 

At the preliminary hearings we 
soon realized that, absurdly, our one 
big difficulty was going to be proving 
to anyone who had not been there 
that the statue had actually started 
growing. With luck we managed to 
get several postponements, and Ray- 
mond and I tried to trace what we 
could of the statue. All we found 
were three small struts, now com- 
pletely inert, rusting in the sand on 
the edge of one of the junkyards in 
Red Beach. Apparently taldng me 
at my word, the contractor had 
shipp^ the rest of the statue to a 
steel mill to be melted down. 



Our only case now rested on what 
amounted to a plea of self-defense. 
Raymond and myself testified that 
the statue had started to grow, and 
then Blackett delivered a long 
homily to the judge on what he be- 
lieved to be the musical shortcom- 
ings of the statue. The judge, a 
crusty and short-tempered old man 
of the hanging school, immediately 
decided that we were trying to pull 
his leg. We were finished from the 
start. 

The final judgment was not de- 
livered until ten months after we had 
first unveiled the statue in the center 
of Vermilion Sands, and the verdict 
when it came was no surprise. 

Lorraine Drexel was awarded thir- 
ty thousand dollars. 

44Tt looks as if we should have 
X taken the pylon after all,” I 
said to Carol as we left the court- 
room. “Even the step-pyramid would 
have been less trouble.” 

Raymond joined us and we went 
out onto the balcony at the end 
of the corridor for some air. 

“Never mind,” Carol said brave- 
ly. “At least it’s all over with.” 

The court building was a new 
one, and by an unpleasant irony ours 
had been the first case to be heard 
there. Much of the floor and plaster- 
work had still to be completed, and 
the balcony was untiled. I was stand- 
ing on an exposed steel cross-beam; 
one or two floors down someone 
must have been driving a rivet into 
one of the girders, and the beam 
under my feet vibrated soothingly. 

Then I noticed that there were no 
sounds of riveting going on any- 



84 



IF 




where, and that the movement un- 
der my feet was not so much a 
vibration as a low rhythmic pulse. 

I bent down and pressed my 
hands against the beam. Raymond 
and Carol watched me curiously. 
“Mr. Hamilton, what is it?” Carol 
asked when I stood up. 

“Raymond,” I said. “How long 
ago did they first start on this build- 
ing? The steel framework, anyway.” 
“Four months, I think. Why?” 
“Four.” I nodded slowly. ‘Tell 
me, how long would you say it took 
any random piece of scrap iron to be 
reprocessed through a steel mill and 
get back into circulation?” 

“Years, if it lay around in the 
wrong junkyards.” 

“But if it had actually arrived 
at the steel null?” 

“A month or so. Less.” 

I started to laugh, pointing to the 
girder. “Feel that! Go on, feel it!” 
Frowning at me, they knelt down 
and pressed their hands to the girder. 
Then Raymond looked up at me. 

I stopp^ laughing. “Did you feel 
it?” 

“Feel it?” Raymond repeated. “I 
can hear it. Lorraine Drexel — the 
statue. It’s here!” 

Carol was patting the girder and 
listening to it. “I think it’s hum- 
ming,” she said, puzzled. “It sounds 
like <the statue.” 

When I started to laugh again 
Raymond held my arm. “Snap out of 
it, the whole building will be singing 
soon!” 

“I know%” I said weaMly. “And it 
won’t be just this building either.” 
I took Carol by the arm. “Come 
on, let’s see if it’s started.” 



V 

W e went up to the top floor. 

The plasterers were about to 
move in, and there were trestles and 
laths all over the place. The walls 
were still bare brick. 

We didn’t have to look very far. 
Jutting out from one of the steel 
joists below the roof was a long 
metal helix, hollowing itself slowly 
into a delicate sonic core. Without 
moving, we counted a dozen others. 
A faint twanging sound come from 
them, like early arrivals at a rehear- 
sal of some vast orchestra of sitar 
players, seated on every plain and 
hilltop of the Earth. 

“An authentic Drexel,” I said. 
“All the mannerisms. Nothing much 
to look at yet, but wait till it really 
gets going.” 

Raymond wandered round, bis 
mouth open. “It’U tear the building 
apart. Just think of the noise.” 
Carol was staring up at one of the 
shoots. “Mr. Hamilton, you said 
they’d melted it all down.” 

“They did, angel. So it got back 
into circulation, touching off all the 
other metal it came into contact with. 
Lorraine Drexel’s statue is here, in 
this building, in a dozen other build- 
ings, in ships and planes . .” 
“They’ll stop it,” Carol said. 
“They might,” I admitted. “But 
it’ll probably get back again some- 
how. A few pieces always will.” I 
put my arm round her waist and be- 
gan to dance to the strange abstract- 
ed music, for some reason as beauti- 
ful now as Lorraine Drexel’s wistful 
eyes. “Did you say it was all over? 
Carol, it’s only just beginning. The 
whole world will be singing!” END

FBIDAY AT THE FANOCLASTS 

by LIN CARTER 



Our Mon m Fandom fakes 
us fo a typically non- 
fypical fan club meeting 



E ver wonder wliat actually hap- 
pens at a fan club meeting — 
what the fans do — whait they talk 
about? Those of you who aren’t 
lucky enough, to live within “visit- 
ing distance” of a fanclub may be 
curious as to the exact goings-on. 
I thought (that this month I’d sort 
of take you on a guided tour of a 
fanclub. So come along with Your 
Man In Fandom, and we’ll spend 
Friday night with the Fanoclasts, 
biggest and most active of the fan- 
clubs here in New York City and 
one of the vital centers of Fandom 
today, as sponsor club to the 1967 
World Science Fiction Convention, 
Nycon III. 

The Fanoclasts are an informal 
crew, scorning club officers and con- 
stitutions and like that. Whoever 
throws open his apartment to the 
bunch is host to the club and as 
near to an officer »as the Fano- 
clasts ever get. Rising science-fic- 
tion writer Ted White, an editor of 



The Magazine of Fantasy and Sci- 
ence Fiction, is the current host 
Every other Friday the group meets 
at his apartment in Brooklyn, s^talt- 
ing (about nine o’clock. 

My wife, Noel, and I were among 
the first (to get (there. We put our 
coats in a comer and looked around. 
Ted has a ground-fioor apartment, 
three rooms or ao, and the living 
room was mostly given over to 
shelves. Ted has an admirable collec- 
tion of pulp ntagaziDes, literally 
thousands of them, mostly science 
fiction; but there were also long 
ranks of several of the old super- 
hero magazines: Doc Savage, The 
Shadow, The Avenger and that sort 
of thing. Another room held a wall 
packed soMd with paperbacks, and 1 
noticed a stack of Big Little Books 
piled in a comer. Ted’s equally im- 
pressive collection of comic books 
must have been packed away some- 
where, for I didn’t see any around. 

The living room also held Ted’s 



86 



stereo and several paintings, modem, 
impressionistic tihings, as well as a 
cover sketch by Frank Frazetta and 
Jack Gaughan’s Pop Ait portrait of 
Ted. There were also some oats; 
on inquiring, I learned the Whites 
currently keep four kittens named 
Pooh Bear, Tigger, Kanga and Roo, 
as well as their parents, Aphrodite 
and Sinbad. I speculated aloud as 
to how this brood would get along 
with my own family of four dogs 
and eight puppies! 

A mong the first arrivals were Dick 
and Pat Lupoff and Dave and 
Cindy Van Amam. The Lupoffs 
used to be hosts to the Fanoclasts 
when they had an apartment in New 
York. Since Dick’s job with Xerox 
took them upstate to Poughkeepsie 
they get down rarely. Dick is the 
editor of Canaveral Press, the pub- 
lishing affiliate of Bible & Tannen, 
the booksellers; and he edited those 
recent hardcover editions of Edgar 
Rice Burroughs. Dick has also just 
become a science-fiction writer, sell- 
ing his first novel to Lancer Books. 

Dave Van Amam has been colla- 
borating with Ted on some science 
fiction and just sold a novel of his 
own to Belmont. We got to talking 
about the curious fact that whoever 
hosts the Fanoclasts for any length 
of time seems to turn pro, as Dick 
did and Dave too, for he briefly 
hosted the club. I was host myself 
for several months and have sold 
ten science-fiction novels myself to 
the paperbacks, so I agre^ with 
the fact that this eerie phenomenon 
seems to actually work. 

Ted put some light jazz on the 



stereo, and Dave Van Amam went 
out to bring back some soda, and 
beer, ‘and pretty soon people started 
to trickle in. The first I spoke to 
was a fan named Alex Panshin. Alex 
has sold a few stories to Analog and 
Worlds of Tomorrow, and he’s writ- 
ten a booklength critical study of the 
fiction of Robert Heinlein. He 
hasn’t yet been able to find a pub- 
lisher, but he’s still looking around. 

Since Heinlein has been one of my 
favorite science-fiction writers for a 
good twenty years, we got to com- 
paring notes on the books. I asked 
Alex whait his top favorites were, 
and he named Beyond This Horizon, 
Have Space Ship Will Travel and 
one of the juveniles, perhaps Red 
Planet, His choice of these as Hein- 
ledn’s best baffled me, for I would 
name Methuselah*s Children and 
Citizen of the Galaxy and Glory 
Road, myself. MY choices seemed to 
baffle HIM too, so we failed to 
agreed. 

I do hope his book gets publish- 
ed, though, I’d very much like to 
read it. The title is Heinlein in Di-^ 
mension. 

Meanwhile, Dave Van Amam was 
passing out neatly mimeographed 
copies of his weekly one-page fan- 
mag, First Draft it was, in fact, the 
154th weekly issue! I looked it over 
while my wife talked to Cindy and 
Pat Lup^f. Casual, chatty stuff, fill- 
ed with Van Amam’s personal ob- 
servations on various topics, such as 
Jackie Kennedy’s announcement that 
she would write her own memoirs 
(seeing as how the Manchester pro- 
ject bombed out, in her estimation) 
and similar matters of the moment. 



FRIDAY AT FANOCLASTS

S everal more Faiioclasts had ar- 

ivved by this poimit 1 said hello to 

Terry aiKl Carol Carr, and to Lee 
Hoffman. Terry is one of the editors 
of Ace Books and has just done a 
hardcover anithology for Doubleday 
with the intriguing title. Science 
Fiction For People Who Hate ScU 
ence Fiction, He sports one of the 
blackest, lushest beards in Fandom. 
Lee Hoffman has written a couple 
of Western novels and was telling 
us that she has just sold three sd- 
ence-fiotion novels to Belmont. 

“How did it happen?” I asked. She 
shrugged. 

“I don’t know. One morning at a 
completely ridiculous hour — like 
noon — I got this plot-idea and 
hopped out of bed to start writing 
it down • • 

Across the room, Ted was talking 
to some young guys. Ted and Dave 
Van Amam are co-chairmen of the 
1967 Worldcon; and Ted was re- 
lating on his dry, precise way how 
they got a letter recently from the 
New York City Convention Bureau. 
The Bureau wanted information on 
Nycon in, saying some flying-saucer 
groups had asked for det^ on the 
science-fiction convention and might 
wish to attend. 

“I wrote them that we did not 
wish any flying-saucer groups to at- 
tend, and that was that,” he fin- 
ished laconically. 

Several young fans who read this 
column got me off in a comer and 
fired questions at me. 

“Do you know where I can get a 
oc^ of The Poetic EddaV one of 
them asked me unexpectedly. While 
I was telling him that this ancient 



loelandic mythologioal “bible” of the 
Norse religion is in print from the 
American-Scandinavian Foundation 
in English. 1 noticed sciencenfiction 
artist Jack Gaughan arriving. He 
came all the way from the hidden 
Plateau of Leng in the forbidden 
depths of trackless New Jersey, bear- 
ing the artwork for Nycon Com- 
ics #3. This fannish comicbook is 
one of the things you get when you 
join the Nycon, and it’s one of the 
funniest things I’ve seen in years. 1 
tried to disengage myself from the 
gaggle of question-askers so as to 
get a look at tihe latest Nycon Com- 
ics, but it wasn’t easy. 

Another fellow was asking me 
questions about Robert E. Howard. 
He had heard I was busy complet- 
ing some fragmenitary “I^g KuU” 
and “Conan” stories for Lancer 
Books, stories Robert E. Howard 
probably would have sent on to the 
old Weird Tales if he’d lived to 
finisth them, but which were dis- 
covered after his death by his liter- 
ary aigent, Glenn Lord of Pasadena, 
Texas. 

Ted changed records on the stereo, 
and I got free and began chuckling 
over Jack Gaugh^’s comic art. 1 
noticed Ted was passing out, to a 
select few, copies of his new chil- 
dren’s book The Secret of the Ma- 
rauder Satellite, just published by 
Westminster Press. 1 saw him slip 
a copy to Terry Carr and to Jack 
Gauglmi, who designed the book 
jacket 

The room was beginning to fill up 
by tfhis time, and people were spill- 
mg over into the kitchen. The soft 
undercurrent of jazz made a sort of 



68 



IP 




couniterpoint to the erratic currents 
of conversiation. Ted was showing 
pasteups of pages from the Nycon’s 
second Progress Report. 

On the living room couch, Dick 
Lupoff was describing his Lancer 
novel, still untitled. It’s a sort of 
sword & sorcery thing, but with 
overtones of time travel. As I came 
by, he was* telling Lee Hoffman and 
others about a peculiar airship he 
had invented for the novel. It sound- 
ed to me rather like a mechanical 
grasshopper, operating on the pogo- 
stick principle: you start off taking 
wee Mttle tiny hops in it, and every 
time it hits the ground it bounces 
higher and higher until after a while 
you are taking stupendous mile-jhigh 
leaps over the landscape. 

“Fantastic!” Lee laughed. Dick 
goggled with an expression of mock- 
indignation. 

“Fantastic? That’s the hard science 
in my story. I’ll have you know,” 
he protested. 

I t was nearly time for “The Aven- 
gers.” The Fanoclasts have re- 
cently formed the habit of watch- 
ing itMs tv show during club evenings. 
It seems to be a deeply ingrained 
habit, for although “The Avengers’ ” 
time was pre-empted this evening to 
make room for some awful feature 
on popular music called “The Song- 
makers,” they went right on watch- 
ing Channel 7 as if by force of habit. 

Nothing bores me more than tele- 
vision, unless it’s popular music; 
and the combination of the two 
drove me into the kitchen where I 
got into a conversation with Andy 
Porter. Andy has been “first reader” 



for F&SF for some time now; and 
he told me, beaming with pride, that 
he has just been made some sort of 
associate editor of the magazine. We 
talked about various writers — I 
think I held forth on Keith Lau- 
mer, a writer I am particularly fond 
of — while Andy worked around 
to a pointed critique of the recent 
“Our Man In Fandom” columns he 
had seen. 

In the front room Terry Carr and 
Jack Gaughan and Ted were talking 
about various matters, including how 
much they all liked Harlan Ellison; 
and Ted showed me around his 
study where he does most of his 
writing. I got into a conversation 
with Dave and Andy over Keith Lau- 
mer again; it happened that I had 
with me the Simon & Schuster hard- 
cover edition of Laumer’s The Great 
Time Machine Hoax, which I had 
picked up that afternoon, and I 
was praising it to the skies. 

Someone came up and asked me 
about the weird sonnet-sequence I 
wrote in imitation of H.P. Love- 
craft’s “Fungi from Yuggoth” and 
which was being intermittently seri- 
alized in the fanzine Amra. I told 
him another installment was in the 
works and passed along the news 
that August Derleth was interested in 
publishing these sonnets and the rest 
of my macabre verse in book form; 
Arkham House will do them under 
the title of Dreams From R*lyeh, 
We discussed Amra, George Scithers’ 
admirable, entertaining, Hugo-win- 
ning fanzine for awhile, and then it 
was time for my wife and I to catch 
our train back to Long Island.

A BOWl 

BIGGER THAN EARTH 

PHILIP JOSE FARMER 

Illustrated by GAUGHAN 



He didn't remember how he had 
come to this planet. He only 
remembered that he was dead! 



I awakening from his deathbed, of be- 

ing shot outwards over the edge of 

N o squeeze. No pain. a bowl bigger than Earth seen from 

Death has a wide pelvis, he a space capsule. Sprawling outwards, 
thought — much later, when he had he landed on his hands and knees on 
time to reflect. a gentle slope. So gentle it was. He 

Now he was screaming. did not tear his hands and knees but 

He had had an impression of slid smoothly onward and downward 



90 




on the great curve. The material on 
which he accelerated looked much 
like . brass and felt frictionless. 
Though he did not think of it then — 
he was too panic-stricken to do any- 
thing but react — he knew later 
that the brassy stuff had even less 
resistance than oil become a solid. 
And the brass, or whatever it was, 
formed a solid seamless ^eet. 

The only break was in the center, 
where the sheet ended. There, far 
ahead and far below, the bowl curv- 
ed briefly upward. 

Gathering speed, he slipped along 
the gigantic chute. He tried to stay 
on his hands and knees; but, when 
he twisted his body to see behind 
him, he shifted his weight. Over he 
went onto his side. Squawling, he 
thrashed around, and he tried to dig 
his nails into the brass. No use. He 
met no resistance, and he began 
spinning aroimd, around. He did see, 
during his whirlings, the rim from 
which he had been shoved. But he 
could see only the rim itself and, 
beyond, the blue cloudless sky. 

Overhead was the sun, looking 
just like the Terrestrial sim. 

He rolled over on his back and 
succeeded during the maneuver in 
stopping the rotations. He also man- 
aged to see ihis own body. He began 
screaming again, the first terror 
driven out and replaced by — or 
added to as a higher harmonic — 
the terror of finding himself in a 
sexless body. 

Smooth. Projectionless. Hairless. 
His legs hairless, too. No navel. His 
skin a dark brown — like an 
Apache’s. 

Morfiks screamed and screamed, 



and he gripped his face and the top 
of his head. Then he screamed high- 
er and higher. The face was not the 
one he knew (the lidge of bone 
above the e^es and the broken nose 
were not there), and his head was 
smooth as an egg. 

He fainted. 

L ater, although it could not have 
been much later, he came to 
his senses. Overhead was the bright 
sun and beneath him was the cool 
nonfriction. 

He turned his face to one side, 
saw the same brass and had no sen- 
sation of sliding because he had 
no reference point. For a moment 
he thought he might be at the end 
of his descent. But on lifting his 
head he saw that the bottom of the 
bowl was closer, that it was rushing 
at him. 

His heart was leaping in his chest 
as if trying to batter itself to a 
second death. But it did not fail. 
It just drove the blood through his 
ears imtil he could hear its roar even 
above the air rushing by. 

He lowered his head until ks back 
was supported by the brass, and he 
closed his eyes against the sun. Never 
in all his life (lives?) had he felt 
so helpless. More helpless than a 
newborn babe, who does not know 
he is helpless and who cannot think 
and who will be taken care of if he 
cries. 

He had screamed, but no one was 
running to take care of him. 

Downward he slipped, brass-yel- 
low curving away on both sides of 
him, no sensation of heat against 
his back where the skin should have 



A BOWL BIGGER THAN EARTH 



91 




burned off a long time ago and his 
muscles should now be burning. 

The incline began to be less down- 
ward, to straighten out. He shot 
across a flat space which he had no 
means of estimating because he was 
going too fast. 

The flatness gave away to a curv- 
ing upwards. He felt that he was 
slowing down; he hoped so. If he 
continued at the same rate of speed, 
he would shoot far out and over the 
center of the bowl. 

Here it camel The rim! 

He went up with just enough 
velocity to rise perhaps seven feet 
above the edge. Then, falling, he 
glimpsed a city of brass beyond the 
people gathered on the shore of a 
river but lost sight of these in the 
green waters rushing up towards him 
directly below. 

He bellowed in anguish, tried to 
straighten out, and flailed his arms 
and legs. In vain. The water struck 
him on his left side. Half-stunned, 
he plunged into the cool and dark 
waters. 

By the time he had broken the 
surf^ again, he had regained his 
senses. There was only one thing to 
do. Behind him, the brassy wall 
reared at least thirty feet straight 
up. He had to swim to the shore, 
which was about four hundred yards 
away. 

vhiBi if he had not been able to 
swim? What if he chose to drown 
now rather than face the unknown 
on the beach? 

A boat was his answer. A flat- 
bottomed boat of brass rowed with 
brass oars by a brown-skinned man 
(man?). In the bow stood a similar 



creature (similar? exactly alike) ex- 
tending a long pole of brass. 

The manlike thing in the bow call- 
ed out, “Grab hold, and I’ll pull 
you in.” 

Morfiks replied with an obsenity 
and began swimming toward the 
beach. The fellow with the pole 
howled, “A trouble-maker, heh? 
We’ll have no antisocial actions here, 
citizen!” 

He brought the butt of the pole 
down with all his strength. 

It was then that Morfiks found 
that he was relatively invulnerable. 
The pole, even if made of material 
as light as aluminum and hollow, 
should have stunned him and cut his 
scalp open. But it had bounced off 
with much less effect than the fall 
into the river. 

‘^ome into the boat,” said the 
poleman. "Or nobody here will like 
you.*' 

U 

Tft was this threat that cowed Mor- 
X fiks. After climbing into the boat, 
he sat down on the bench in front 
of the rower and examined the two. 
No doubt of it. They were twins. 
Same height (both were sitting now) 
as himself. Hairless, except for long 
curling black eyelashes. Same fea- 
tures. High foreheads. Smooth hair- 
less brows. Straight noses. Full lips. 
Well developed chins. Regular, al- 
most classical features, delicate, 
looking both feminine and mascu- 
line. Their eyes were the same shade 
of dark brown. Their skins were 
heavily tanned. Their bodies were 
slimly built and quite human except

IF 




for the disooncertmg lack of sex, 
navel and nipples on the masculine 
chests, 

“Where am I?” said Morfiks. “In 
the fourth dimension?” 

He had read about that in the 
vSunday supplements and some of the 
more easily digesteds. 

“Or in Hell?” he added, which 
would have been his first question 
if he had been in his Terrestrial 
body. Nothing that had happened so 
far made him thing he was in Heav- 
en. 

The pole rapped him in the mouth, 
and he thought that either the pole- 
man was pulling his punches or else 
his new fle^ was less sensitive than 
his Terrestrial. The last must be it. 
His lips felt almost as numb as 
when the dentist gave him novo- 
caine before pulling a tooth. And 
his meager buttocks did not hurt 
from sitting on the hard brass. 

Moreover, he had all his teeth. 
There were no fillings or bridges in 
his mouth. 

“You will not use that word,” said 
the poleman. “It’s not nice, and it’s 
not true. The protectors do not 
like that word and will take one 
hundred per cent effective measures 
to punish anybody responsible for 
offending the public taste with it.” 
“You mean the word beginning 
with H?” said Morfiks cautiously. 
“You’re catching on fast, citizen.” 
“What do you call this . place?” 
“Home. Just plain home. Allow 
me to introduce myself. I’m one of 
the official gieeters. I have no name; 
nobody here does. Citizen is good 
enough for me and for you. How- 
ever, being a greater doesn’t make 



me one whit better than you, citi- 
zen. It’s just my job, that’s alL We 
all have jobs here, all equally im- 
portant. We’re all on the same level, 
citizen. No cause for envy or strife.” 
“No name?” Morfiks said. 
“Forget that nonsense. A name 
means you’re trying to set yourself 
apart Now, you wouldn’t think it 
was nice if somebody thought he 
wias better than you bwause he had 
a name that was big in We-know- 
where, would you? Of course not.” 
“I’m here for . how long?” 
Morfiks said. 

“Who knows?” 

“Forever?” Morfiks said dismally. 

T he end of the pole butted into 
his lips. His head rocked back, 
but he did not hurt much. 

“Just think of the present citizen. 
Because that is all that exists. The 
past doesn’t exist; the future can’t 
Only the present exists.” 

“There’s no future?” 

Again, the butt of the pole. 
“Forget that word. We use it on 
the river when we’re breaking in 
immigrants. But once on the shore, 
we’re through with it. Here, we’re 
practical. We don’t indulge in fan- 
tasy.” 

“I get your message,” Morfiks 
said. He damped the impulse to leap 
at the poleman’s throat. Better to 
wait until he found out what the 
setup was, what a man could or 
could not get away with. 

The rower said, “Coming ashore, 
citizens.” 

Morfiks noticed that the two had 
voices exactly alike, and he sup- 
posed his own was the same as theirs. 



A BOWL BIGGER THAN EARTH 



93 




But he had a secret trkiinph. His 
voice would sound different to him- 
self; he had that much edge on the 
bastards. 

The boat nudged onto the beach, 
and Morfiks followed the other two 
onto the sand. He looked quickly 
behmd him and now saw that there 
were many boats up and down the 
river. Here and there a body shot 
up over the rim of. the brassy cliff 
and tumbled down into the waters 
as he had a few minu tes ago. 

Beyond the lip of the cliff rose 
the swell of the brass slide down 
which he had hurtled. The slide ex- 
tended so far that he could not see 
the human figures that undoubtedly 
must be standing on the edge where 
he had stood and must just now be 
in the act of being pushed from 
behind. Five miles away, at least, 
five miles he had slid. 

A colossal building project, he 
thought. 

Beyond the dty of brass rose an- 
other incline. He understood now 
that he had been mistaken in believ- 
ing the city was in the middle of a 
bowl. As far as he could see, there 
was the river and the city and the 
cliffs and slides on both sides. And 
he supposed that there was another 
river on the other side of the dty. 

The dty reminded him of the 
suburban tract in which he had lived 
on Earth. Rows on rows of square 
brass houses, exactly alike, fadng 
each other across twenty-foot wide 
streets. Earth house was about 
twelve feet wide. Each had a flat 
roof and a door in front and back, 
a strip of windows which drcled 
the house like a transpaieot belt 



There were no yards. A space of two 
feet separated each house from its 
neighbor. 

A person stepped out of the crowd 
standing on the beach. This one dif- 
fered from the others only in having 
a band of some black metal around 
the biceps of its right arm. 

“Officer of the Day,” it said in 
a voice exactly like the two in the 
boat “Your turn will come to act 
in this capadty. No favorites here.” 

I t was then that Morfits recognized 
the possibilities of individualism 
in voice, of recognizing others. Even 
if everybody had identical dimen- 
sions in larynxes and the resonating 
chambers of palate and nasal pas- 
sages, they must retain their habits 
of intonation and choice of pitch 
and words. Also, despite identical 
bodies and legs, they must keep some 
of their peculiar g^tures and m^- 
ods of walking. 

“Any complaints about treatment 
so far?” said the O.D. 

“Yes,” said Morfiks. “This jerk 
hit me three times witii its pole.” 
“Only because we love it,” said 
the poleman. “We struck it — oh, 
very lightly! — to correct its ways. 
As a father — pardon the word — 
punishes a child he loves. Or an 
older brother his little brother. We 
are all brothers . • . 

“We are guilty of antisocial be- 
havior,” said the O.D. sternly. 
“We’re very very sorry, but we 
must report this incident to the Pro- 
tectors. Believe us, it hurt us . .” 
“Worse than it hurts us,” said 
the poleman wearily. “We know.” 
“We’ll have to add cynicism to the 

IF

A BOWL BIGGER THAN EARTH 



charge,” said the O.D. “K.P. for 
several months if we know the Pro- 
tectors. Should anybody be guilty 
again — ” 

llie O.D. told Morfiks to walk 
with it, and it briefed Morfiks as 
they went through the streets. These 
were made of a pale violet rubbery 
substance only slightly warm to the 
feet despite the sun beating down 
upon it. Morfiks would be given his 
own home. He was lord and master 
there and could do whatever he 
wished in it as long as he did not 
break any rules of public morality. 

“You mean I can invite anybody 
I want to and can keep out anybody 
I want to?” 

“Well, you can invite anybody 
you want. But don’t throw anybody 
out who comes in uninvited. Tliis is, 
unless the uninvited behaves antiso- 
cially. In which case, notify the 
O.D., and we’ll notify a Protector.” 

^‘How can I be master of my 
house if I can’t choose my guests?” 
Morfiks said. 

“The citizen doesn’t understand,” 
said the O.D. “A citizen should not 
want to keep another citizen out of 
his house. Doing so is saying that a 
citizen doesn’t love all citizens as 
brothers and sisters. It’s not nice. 
We want ^ be nice, don’t we?” 

Morfiks replied that had always 
been kriown as a nice guy, and he 
continued to listen to the O.D. But, 
on passing an area where a large 
field coated with the violet rubber 
broke the monotonous rows of 
houses, he said, “Looks like a chil- 
dren’s playground with oil those 
swings, seesaws, games, trampolines. 
Where are the kids? And how — 



“Only the Protectors know what 
happens to the children who come 
from We-Know-Where,” said the 
O.D. “It’s better, much, much bet- 
ter, not to ask them about it. In 
fact, it’s very good not to see or 
talk to a Protector. 

“No, the playgrounds are for the 
amusement of us citizens. However, 
the Protectors have been thinking 
about taking them down. Too many 
citizens quarrel about who gets to 
use them, instead of amicably ar- 
ranging predecedence and turns. 
They actually dare to fight each 
other even if fighting’s forbidden. 
And they manage, somehow, to hurt 
each other. We don’t want anybody 
to get hurt, do we?” 

“I guess not. What do you do for 
entertainment, otherwise?” 

“First things first, citizen. We 
don’t like to use any of the personal 
pronouns except we, of course, and 
us and our and ours, I, me, they, 
you all differentiate. Better to forget 
personal differences here, heh? 
After all, we’re just one big happy 
family, heh?” 

“Sure,” Morfiks said. “But there 
must be times when a citizen has to 
point out somebody. How do I — 
we — identify someone guilty of, say, 
antisocial behavior?” 

“It doesn’t matter,” said the O.D. 
“Point out anyone. Yourself — if 
you’ll pardon the word — for in- 
stance. We all share in the punish- 
ment, so it makes no difference.” 
“You mean 1 have to be punished 
for someone else’s crime? That isn’t 
fairV* 

“It may not seem so to us at first,” 
said the O.D. “But consider. We’re 



96 



IF 




brothers, not only under the skin 
but on skin. If a crime is com- 
mitted, the guilt is shared by all be- 
cause, actually, all are responsible. 
And if punishment is given to all, 
then all will try to prevent crime. 
Simple, isn’t it? And fair, too.” 
“But you — we — said that the 
poleman would be given K.P. Does 
that mean we all go on K.P.?” 
“We did not commit a feflony, only 
a misdemeanor. If we do it again, 
we are a felon. And we suffer. It’s 
the only nice thing to do, to share, 
right?” 

M orfiks did not like it. He was 
the one hit in the teeth, so 
why should he, the victim, have to 
take the punishment of the aggres- 
sor? 

But he said nothing. He had got- 
ten far on We-Know-Where by 
keeping his mouth shut. It paid off; 
everybody had thought he was a 
nice guy. And he was a nice guy. 

There did seem to be one fallacy 
in the setup. If being a stool pigeon 
meant you, too, suffered, why turn 
anybody in? Wouldn’t it be smarter 
to keep quiet and inflict the punish- 
ment yourself on the aggressor? 

“Don’t do it, citizen,” said the 
O.D. 

Morfiks gasped. 

The O.D. smiled and said, “No, 
we can’t read minds. But every im- 
migrant thinks the same thing when 
told about the system. Keeping quiet 
only results in double punishment. 
The Protectors — whom this citizen 
has never seen face to face and 
doesn’t want to — have some means 
of monitoring our behavior. They 



know when we’ve been antisocial. 
The offender is, of course, given a 
certain amount of time in which to 
confess the injury. After that . .” 

To keep himself from bursting in- 
to outraged denunciation of the sys- 
tem, Morfiks asked more questions. 

Yes, he would be confined to this 
neighborhood. If he traveled outside 
it, he might find himself in an area 
where his language was not spoken. 
That would result in his feeling in- 
ferior and different because he was 
a foreigner. Or, worse, superior. Any- 
way, why travel? Any place look^ 
like every place. 

Yes, he was free to discuss any 
subject as long as it did not concern 
We-Know-Where. Talking of that 
place led to discussions of — for- 
give the term — one^s former iden- 
tity and prestige. Besides, contro- 
versial subjects might arise and so 
lead to antisocial behavior. 

Yes, .this place was not construct- 
ed, physically, like We-Know-Where. 
The sun mi^t be a small body; 
some eggheads had estimated it to 
be only a mile wide. The run orbited 
around the strip, which was compos- 
ed of the slides, two rivers and the 
city between the rivers, all of whidi 
hung in space. There was some 
speculation that his place was in a 
pocket universe the dimensions of 
which were probably not more than 
fifty miles wide and twenty high. It 
was shaped like an intestine, closed 
at one end and open at the other to 
infinity — maybe. 

At this point, the O.D. cautioned 
Morfiks alwut the perils of intellec- 
tual speculation. This could be a 
misdemeanor or felony. In any event. 



A BOWL BIGGER THAN EARTH 



97 




eggheadedness was to be avoided. 
Pretending to be brainier your 
neighbor, to question the unquestion- 
able, was unegalitarian. 

“There’s no worry about that,** 
Morfiks said. “If there’s anything 
hateful and despicable, it’s egghead- 
edness,” 

“Oongratulaitions on skill in avoid- 
ing the personal,” said the O.D. 
“We’ll get along fine here.” 

m 

T iey entered an immense building 
in which citizens were sitting 
on brass benches and eating off 
brass tables running the length of the 
building. The O.D. told Morfiks to 
sit down and eat. Afterwards, Mor- 
fiks could get to his new home. No. 
12634, by asking directions. The 
O.D. left, and a citizen on K.P. 
served Morfiks soup in a big brass 
bowl, a small steak, bread and but- 
ter, salad vdth garlic dressing and a 
pitciher of water. The utensils and 
cup were of brass. 

He wondered where the food came 
from, but before he could ask, he 
was informed by a citizen on his 
right that he was not holding the 
spoon properly. After a few minutes 
of instruction and observation, Mor- 
fiks found himself able to master eti- 
quette as practiced here. 

“Having the same table manners 
as everybody else makes a citizen a 
part of the group,” said the instruc- 
tor. “If a citizen eats differently, 
then a citizen is impolite. Impolite- 
ness is antisocial. Get it?” 

“Got it,” said Morfiks. 

After eating, he asked the citizen 



where he could locate No. 12634. 

“We’ll show us,” said the citiz^ 
“We live near that number.” 

Together, they walked out of the 
hall and down the street. The sun 
was near the horizon now. Time 
must go faster, he thought, for it did 
not seem to him that he had been 
here for more than a few hours. 
Maybe the Protectors sent the sun 
around faster so the days would be 
shorter. 

They came to No. 12634, and 
Morfik’s guide preceded him through 
swinging batwing doors into a large 
room with luminescent walls. There 
was a wide couchbed of the violet 
rubbery substance, several chairs cut 
out of solid blocks of the same stuff 
and a brass table in the center of 
the room. In one comer was a cubi- 
cle with a door. He investigated and 
found it to be the toilet. Besides the 
usual sanitary arrangements, the 
cubicle contained a shower, soap 
and four cups. There were no towels. 

“After a shower, step outside,^ 
dry off in the sun,” the guide said. 

It looked at Morfiks for such a 
long time that Morfiks began to get 
nervous. Finally, the guide said, “I’ll 
take a chance you’re a pretty good 
Joe. What was your name on 
Eartii?” 

“John Smith,” said Morfiks. 

“Play it cool, then,” the guide 
said. “But you were a man? A 
male?” 

Morfiks nodded, and the guide 
said, “I was a girl. A woman, I 
mean. My name was Billie.” 

44T^hy tell me this?” he de- 
VV manded susiHdously. 



98 



IP 




Billie came close to Morfiks and 
put her hands on his shoulders. 

“Listen, Johnny boy,” she whis- 
pered. “Those bastards think they 
got us behind the eight ball by put- 
ting us into these neuter bodies. But 
don’t you believe it. There’s more 
than one way of skinning a cat, if 
you know what I mean.” 

“I don’t,” Morfiks said. 

Billie came even closer; her nose 
almost touched his. A face in a mir- 
ror. 

“Inside, you’re just the same,” said 
Billie. “That’s one thing They can’t 
change without changing you so 
much you’re no longer the same 
person. If They do that. They aren’t 
punishing the same person, are They? 
So, you wouldn’t exist any more, 
would you? And being here wouldn’t 
be fair, would it?” 

“I don’t get it,” Morfiks said. He 
took a step backwards; Billie took a 
step forwards. 

“What I mean is, you and me, 
we’re still male and female inside. 
When They, whoever They are, 
stripped off our old bodies. They 
had to leave us our brains and ner- 
vous systems, didn’t They? Other- 
wise, we’d not be ourselves, right? 
They fitted our nervous systems into 
these bodies, made a few adjustments 
here and there, like shortening or in- 
creasing nerve paths to take care 
of a stature different than the one 
you had on Earth. Or pumping some- 
thing inside our skulls to take care 
of brains being too small for the 
skulls They gave us.” 

“Yeah, yeah,” Morfiks said. He 
knew what Billie was going to pro- 
pose, or he thought he did. He was 



breathing hard; a tingle was running 
over his skin; a warmth was spread- 
ing out from the pit of his stomach. 

“Well,” said Billie, “I always 
heard that it was all in your head. 
And that’s true. Of course, there’s 
only so much you can do, and may- 
be it isn’t as good as it was on You- 
Know-Where. But it’s better than 
nothing. Besides, like they say, none 
of it’s bad. It’s all good, some is jusi 
better than others.” 

“You mean?” 

“Just close your eyes,” Billie 
crooned, “and imagine I’m a woman. 
I’ll tell you how I looked, how I was 
stacked. And you think about it 
Then you tell me how you looked, 
don’t hold anything back, no need 
to be bashful here, describe every- 
thing down to the last detail. And 
I’ll imagine how you were.” 

“Think it’ll work?” Morfiks said. 
Billie, her eyes closed, softly sang, 
“I know it will, baby. I’ve been 
around some since I came here.” 
“Yeah, but what about the punish- 
ment?” 

Billie half-opened her eyes and 
said, scornfully, “Don’t believe all 
that jazz, Johnny boy. Besides, even 
if They do catch you, it’s worth it. 
Believe me, it’s worth it.” 

“If only I thought I could put 
one over on Them,” Morfiks said. 
“It’d be worth taking any risk.” 
Billie’s answer was to kiss him. 
Morfiks, though he had to repress 
revulsion, responded. After all, it 
was only the bald head that made 
Billie look like a half-man. 

They struggled fiercely and des- 
perately; their kisses were as deep 
as possible. 



A BOWL BIGGER THAN EARTH

Suddenly Moifiks pushed Billie 
O away fram him. 

“It’s worse than nothing,” he 
panted. “1 think something’s going 
to happen, but it never quite does. 
It’s no use. Now I feel awful.” 

Billie came towards him again, 
saying, “Don’t give up so easy, 
honey. Rome wasn’t erected in a day. 
Believe me, you can do it. But you 
got to have faith.” 

“No, I’m licked,” Morfiks said. 
“Maybe if you did look like a 
woman, instead of just a carbon 
copy of me. Then ... no, that 
wouldn’t be any good. I’m just not 
designed for the job; neither are you. 
They got us wh^e it hurts.” 

Billie lost her half-smile; her face 
twisted. 

“Where it hurts!” she shrilled. 
“Let me tell you, Buster, if you can’t 
get your kicks being a man here, 
you can by hurting somebody! 
That’s about all that’s left!” 

“What do you mean?” Morfiks 
said. 

Billie laughed loudly and long. 
When she mastered herself, she said, 
“I’ll tell you one good thing about 
looking like everybody else. Nobody 
knows what you really are inside. Or 
what you were on Earth. Well, I’ll 
tell you about myself. 

“I was a man!” 

Morfiks sputtered. His fists clench- 
ed. He walked towards Billy. 

But he did not strike her . 
him ... it. 

Instead, he smiled, and he said, 
“Well, let me tell you something. 
My real name was Juanita.” 

Billy became pale, then red. 

“You . you!” 



T he next few days, Morfiks spent 
four hours each morning on 
the building of new houses. It was 
easy work. The walls and sections 
of the roof were brought in on 
wagons of brass pulled by citizens. 
Supervised by foremen, the laborers 
raised die w^dls, secured the bottoms 
to the brass foundation of the city 
with a quick-drying glue and then 
fastened the walls together by gluing 
down strips of the violet stuff at the 
comers of the walls. 

Morfiks took his turn being a 
foreman for one day after he had 
gotten enou^ experience. He asked 
a citizen where the material for the 
houses and die rubber and the glue 
came from. 

“And where’s the food grown?” 
The citizen looked around to 
make sure no one could hear them. 

“The original brass sheets and 
rubber are supposed to have origi- 
nated from the blind end of this uni- 
verse,” he said. “It’s spontaneously 
created, flows like lava from a vol- 
cano.” 

“How can that be?” Morfiks said. 
The citizen shrugged. “How 
should I know? But if you remem- 
ber one of the theories of creation 
back on You-Know-Where, matter 
was supposed to be continuously 
created out of nothing. So if hydro- 
gen atoms can be formed from noth- 
ing, why not brass and rubber lava?” 
“But brass and rubber are or- 
ganized configurations of elements 
and compounds!” 

“So what? The structure of this 
universe orders it.” 

“And the food?” 

“It’s brought up on dumbwaiters 

IB!

through shafts which lead down to 
the underside. The peasants live 
there, citizen, and grow food and 
raise some kind of cattle and poul- 
try.” 

“Gee, I’d like that,” Morfiks said. 
“Couldn’t I get a transfer down 
there? I’d like to work with the soil. 
It’d be much more interesting than 
this.” 

“If you were supposed to be a 
peasant, you’d have been transform- 
ed down there to begin with,” the 
citizen said. “No, you’re a city- 
dweller, brother, and you’U stay one. 
You predetermined that, you know, 
in You-Know-Where.” 

“I had obligations,” Morfiks said. 
“What’d you expect me to do, shirk 
them?” 

“I don’t expect nothing except to 
get out of here some day.” 

“You mean we can get out? How? 
How?” 

“Not so loud with that yoM,” the 
citizen growled. “Yeah, or so we 
heard, anyway. We never saw, a 
corpse but we heard about some of 
us dying. It isn’t easy, though.” 

‘Tell me how I can do it,” Mor- 
fiks said. He grabbed the citizen’s 
arm but the citizen tore himself loose 
and walked away swiftly. 

Morfiks started to follow him, 
then could not identify him because 
he had mingled with a dozen others. 



I n the afternoons, Morfiks spent 
his time playing shuffleboard, 
badminton, swimming or sometimes 
playing bridge. The brass plastic 
cards consisted of two thicknesses 
glued together. The backs were 



blank, and the fronts were punched 
with codes indicating the suits and 
values. Then, after the evening 
meals in the communal halls, there 
were always neighborhood commit- 
tee meetings. These were to settle 
any disputes among the local citi- 
zens. Morfiks could see no sense in 
them other than devices to keep the 
attendants busy and tire them out 
so that they would be ready to go 
to bed. After hours of wrangling 
and speech-making, the disputants 
were always told that the fault lay 
equally on both sides. They were to 
forgive each other, shake hands and 
make up. Nothing was really settled, 
and Morfiks was sure that the dis- 
putants still burned with resentments 
despite their protestations that all 
was now well with them. 

What Morfiks found particularly 
interesting was the public prayer — 
if it could be called that — said by 
an O.D. before each meeting. It 
contained hints about the origins and 
reasons for this place and this life 
but was not specific enough to satis- 
fy his curiosity. 

“Glory be to the Protectors, who 
give us this life. Blessed -be Mberty, 
equality and fraternity. Praise be to 
security, conformity and certainty. 
None of these did we have on We- 
Know-Where, O Protectors, though 
we desired them mightily and strove 
always without success to attain 
them. Now we have them because 
we strove; inevitably we came here, 
glory be! For this cosmos was pre- 
pared for us and when we left that 
vale of slippery, slidery diaos, we 
squeezed through the walls and were 
formed in the template of passage,

given these bodies, sexless, sinless, 
suitable. O Mighty Protectors, in- 
visible but everywhere, we know 
that We-Know-Where is the pristine 
cosmos, the basic world, dirty, many- 
aspected, chaos under the form of 
seeming order, evil but necessary. 
The egg of creation, rotten but gen- 
erative. Now, O Protectors, we are 
shaped forever in that which we cried 
for on that other unhappy uni- 
verse . .” 

There was more but most of it 
was a repetition in different words. 
Morfiks, sitting in the brass pews, 
his head bowed, looked up at the 
smooth hemisphere of the ceiling 
and walls and the platform on which 
the O.D. stood. If he understood the 
O.D., he was bound here forever, 
immortal, each day like the next, 
each month an almost unvarying 
image of the preceding, year after 
year, century after century, millenia 
after millenia. 

“Stability, Unseen but Everfelt 
Protectors. Stability! A place for 
everyone and everyone in a place!” 

The O.D. was saying that there 
were such things as souls, a con- 
figuration of energy which exactly 
duplicated the body of the person 
when he had exist^ on We-Know- 
Where. It was indetectible by instru- 
ments there and so had been denied 
by many. But when one died there, 
the configuration was released from 
the attraction of the body, was some- 
how pushed from one universe into 
the next. 

There were billions of these, aU 
existing within the same space as 
the original universe but polarized 
and at angles to it. A “soul” went 



to that imiveirse for which it had 
the most attraction. 

Indeed, the universe to which it 
traveled had actually been created 
by men and women. The total cumu- 
lative effect of desire for just such a 
place had generated this place. 

I f Morfiks interpreted the vague 
statements of the O.D. correctly, 
the structure of this universe was 
such that when a “soul” or cohesive 
energy configuration came through 
the “walls,” it naturally took the 
shape in which all citizens found 
themselves. It was like hot plastic 
being |>oured into a mold. 

Morfiks dared question a citizen 
who claimed to have been here for 
a hundred years. “The O.D. said all 
questions have been settled, every- 
thing is explained. What’s explained? 
I don’t understand any more about 
the origins or reasons for things here 
than I did on We-Know-Where.” 
“So what’s new?” the citizen said. 
“How can you understand the un- 
understandable? The main differ- 
ence here is that you don’t ask 
questions. There are many answers, 
^1 true, to one question, and this 
place is one answer. So quit bug- 
ging me. You trying to get me — 
uh, us — into trouble? Hey, O.D.!” 
Morfiks hurried off and lost him- 
self in a crowd before he could be 
identified. He burned with resent- 
ment at the implications of this 
world. Why should he be here? Sure, 
on We-Know-Where he had stayed 
with one company for 20 years, he 
had been a good family man, a pal 
to his kids, a faithful husband, a 
pillar of the best church in the neigh-

borhood, ihad paid off ibis mortgages, 
joined tiie lions» Elk, and Moose 
and tihe Masonic Lodge, the PTA, 
the Kiwanis, the Junior Oiamber of 
Commerce and ‘been a hard worker 
for the Democrats. His father before 
him had been a Democrat, and 
though he had had many misgivings 
about some of the policies, he had 
always followed the party line. Any- 
way, he was a right-wing Democrat, 
which made him practically the same 
thing as a left-wing Republican. He 
read the Readers Digest, Look, 
Life, Time, Wall Street Journal, 
Saturday Evening Post, and had al- 
ways tried to keep up with the best- 
sellers as recommended by the local 
newspaper reviewer. All this, not be- 
cause he ^-eally wanted it but be- 
cause he felt that he owed it to his 
wife and kids and for the good of 
society. He had hoped that when he 
went “over yonder” he would be re- 
warded with a life with more free- 
dom, with a number of unlimited 
avenues for -the things he really want- 
ed to do. 

What were those things? He didn’t 
remember now, but he was sure that 
they were not what was available 
here. 

“There’s been a mistake,” he 
thought. “I don’t belong here. Every- 
thing’s all screwed up. I shouldn’t 
be here. This is an error on some- 
body’s part. I got to get out. But 
how can I get out of here any more 
than I could get out of We-Know- 
Where? There the only way out was 
suicide and 1 couldn’t take that, my 
family would have been disgraced. 
Besides, I didn’t feel like it 

“And here I can’t kill myself. My 



body’s too tough and there’s nothing, 
no way for me to commit suicide. 
Drowning? That won’t work. The 
river’s too well guarded, and if you 
did slip by the guards long enough 
to drown, you’d be dragged out in no 
time at and resuscitated. And 
then punished.” 

IV 

O n the fourth night, what he had 
been dreading happened. His 
punishment He woke up in the mid- 
dle of the night with a dull tooth- 
ache. As the night went on, the 
ache became sha^r. By dawn, he 
wanted to scream. 

Suddenly, the batwings on his 
doorway flew open, and one of his 
neighbors (he presumed) stood in 
the room. He/she was breathing 
hard and holding his/her hand to 
his/her jaw. 

“Did you do it?” said the neigh- 
bor in a shrill voice. 

“Do what?” Morfiks said, rising 
from the couch-bed. 

“Antisocial act,” the intruder 
said. “If the culprit confesses, the 
pain will cease. After a while, that 
is.” 

“Did you do it?” Morfiks said. 
For all he knew, he might be talking 
to Billy again. 

“Not me. listen, newcomers 
often — always — commit crimes 
because of a mistaken notion a crime 
can’t be detected. But the crime is 
always found out.” 

“There are newcomers who 
aren’t bom criminals,” Morfiks said. 
Despite his pain, he intended to 
keep control to. 



104 







“Then you, and I mean you, won’t 
confess?” 

“The pain must be breaJdng some 
people apart,” said Morfiks. “Other- 
wise, some wouldn’t be using the 
second person singular.” 

“Singular, heUI” the citizen said, 
breaking two tabus with two words. 
“Okay, so it doesn’t make much dif- 
ference if you or me or the poor 
devil down the street did it. But I 
got a way of beating the game.” 
“And so bringing down more 
punishment on us?” 

“No! Listen, I was a dental assis- 
tant on We-Know-Where. I know 
for a fact that you can forget one 
pain if you have a greater.” 

Morfiks laughed as much as his 
tooth would permit him, and he 
said, “So, what’s the advantage 
there?” 

The citizen smiled as much as his 
toothache would permit. “What I’m 
going to propose will hurt you. But 
it’ll end up in a real kick. You’ll 
enjoy your pain, get a big thrill out 
of it.” 

“How’s that?” Morfiks said, think- 
ing that the citizen talked too much 
like Billy. 

“Our flesh is tough so we can’t 
hurt each other too easily. But we 
can be hurt if we try hard enough. 
It takes perseverence, but then what 
doesn’t that’s worthwhile?” 

The citizen shoved Morfiks onto 
the couch, and, before Morfiks could 
protest, he was chewing on his leg. 

“You do the same to me,” the 
citizen mumbled between bites. 
“I’m telling you, it’s great! You’ve 
never had anything like it before.” 
Morfiks stared down at the bald 



head and the vigorously working 
isms. He ooiuld feel a little pain, and 
ins itoothadie did seem to have eased. 

He said, “Never had anything like 
what?” 

“Like blood,” the citizen said. 
“After you’ve been doing this long 
enough, you’ll get drunk on it,” 

“I don’t know. There, uh, seems 
something wrong about this.” 

he citizen stopped gnawing. 
“You’re a greenhorn! Look at it 
this way. The protectors tell us to 
love one another. So you should 
love me. And you can show your 
love by helping me get rid of this 
toothache. And I can do the same 
for you. After a while, you’ll be like 
all of us. You won’t give a damn; 
you’ll do anything to stop the pain.” 
Morfiks got into position and bit 
down hard. The flesh felt rubbery. 
Then he stopped and said, “Won’t we 
get another toothache tomorrow be- 
cause of what we’re doing now?” 
“We’U get an ache somewhere. 
But forget about tomorrow.” 

“Yeah,” Morfiks said. He was 
beginning to feel more pain in his 
leg. “Yeah. Anyway, we can always 
plead we were just being social.” 
The citizen laughed and said, 
“How social can you get, huh?” 
Morfiks moaned as his crushed 
nerves and muscles began to bleed. 
After a while, he was screaming be- 
tween his teeth, but he kept biting. 
If he was being hurt, he was going 
to hurt the citizen even worse. 

And what the heU, he was begin- 
ning to feel a reasonable facsimile 
to that which he had known up 
there on We-Know-Where. END

FACST 



The world of science does not 
admit the existence of demons 
— but the demons don't carel 



B aines, president of Console 
dated Warfare Service, the 
nitions subsidiary of an internation'- 
al chemical and dye cartel, has ap- 
plied to THERON WARE, a black 
magician of the highest repute, for 
a demonstration of his abilities. Ac- 
companied by his executive assistant, 
JACK GINSBERG, a thorough-go- 
ing skeptic, he visits Ware's rented 
palazzo in the Italian resort town 
of Positano, where Ware provides 
a minor exhibition of alchemy, 
changing two tears successively into 
blood, gold and lead under controll- 
ed circumstances. 

This does not satisfy Baines, who 
has something much bigger in mind. 
Ware warns him that all magic, re- 
gardless of degree, is based upon the 
invocation of angels or demons — 
mostly the latter — and that it is

expensive, dangerous and difficult. 
Baines already knows this from an 
earlier visit to Monte Albano, a 
sanctuary of white magicians. Strict- 
ly as a further test, Baines commis- 
sions Ware to procure by magic the 
death of the current Governor of 
California. Ware agrees. Ginsberg, a 
man of slightly odd tastes, is intri- 
gued by Ware*s obvious confidence 
and in a private interview attempts 
to ask a favor of the magician, but 
doesn*t succeed in specifying what 
it is. Ware offers him the use of a 
succubus, but is refused. 

At Monte Albano, the white 
magicians have divined something 
of the nature of Bainesfs forthcom- 
ing major commission and have rea- 
son to believe it may be a major dis^ 
aster for the whole world. Under 
the terms of the Grand Covenant 



Illustrated by Morrow 

under which dll magic operates, they 
are entitled to impose upon Ware 
a white magician as an observer, 
providing that the white magician 
does not interfere in any way with 
Ware's operations. They choose 
FATHER DOMENICO, a suitably 
skilled and blameless man, who 
does not relish the assignment. 

In the meantime, Baines, who has 
returned to Rome, receives news of 
the death of the Governor of Cali- 
fornia, as specified. He decides to 
return to Posifano, taking with him 
this time not only Jack Ginsberg, 
but also a scientist of his firm, DR. 
ADOLPH HESS, also an observer. 

Thanks to various delays en route, 
Baines, Ginsberg, Hess and Fr. Do- 
menico all arrive for the next invo- 
cation of Hell at the same time — 
during the Christmas season.

*|pieitiheir Domenioo’s iiiiterview <with 
P, Theron Ware was tineif» formal 
and edgy. The HK>nk» despite his ap- 
prehensLQDs, had b^n cniious to 
see what the magician looked like 
and had been irrationally disappoint- 
ed ito ^d him not much out of the 
ordiinary run of intellectuals. Except 
for the tonsure, of course; like 
Baines, Fr. Domenico found that 
startling. Also, unlike Baines, he 
found it upsetting, because he knew 
the reason for it — not that Ware 
intended any mockery of his pious 
counterparts, but bemuse demons, 
given a moment of inattention, were 
prone to semng one by the hair. 

“Under the Covenant,” Ware told 
him in excellent Latin, “I have no 
choice but to receive you, of course. 
Father. And under other circum- 
stances I might even have enjoyed 
discussing the Art with you, even 
though we are of opposite schools. 
But this is an inconvenient time for 
me. I’ve got a very important cHent 
here, os you’ve seen, and I’ve al- 
ready been notified that what he 
wants of me is likely to be extra- 
ordinarily lambitious.” 

“I shan’t interfere in any way,” 
Fr. Domenico said. “Even ^ould I 
wish to, which obviously I shall, I 
know very well that any such inter- 
ference would cost me all my pro- 
tections.” 

“I was sure you understood that, 
but nonetheless I’m glad to hear you 
say so,” Ware said. “However, your 
very presence here is an embi^ass- 
ment — not only because I’ll have to 
explain it to my client, but also be- 

108 



cause it changes the atmosphere un- 
favorably and will make my opera- 
tions more difficult I can ohly hope, 
in defiance of all hospitality, that 
your mission will be speedily satis- 
fied.” 

“I can’t bring myself to regret 
the difficulty, since I only wish I 
could make your operations outright 
impossible. The b^ I can proffer 
3 TOU is strict adherance to the truce. 
As for the length of my stay, that 
depends wholly on what it is your 
client turns out to want and how 
long that takes. I am charged with 
seeing the matter through to its con- 
clusion.” 

“A prime nuisance,” Ware said. 
“I suppose I should be grateful that 
I haven’t been blessed with this kind 
of attention from Monte Albono be- 
fore; evidently what Mr. Baines in- 
tends is even bigger than he thinks 
it is. I conclude without much cere- 
bration that you know something 
about it I don’t know.” 

“It will be an immense disaster, I 
can tell you that.” 

44 T Tmm. From your point of 

Xl view, but not necessarily 
from mine, possibly. I don’t suppose 
you’re prepared to offer any fu^er 
information — on the chance, say, of 
dissuading me?” 

“Certainly not,” Fr. Domenico 
said indignantly. “If eternal damna- 
tion hasn’t dissuaded you long be- 
fore this. I’d be a fool to hope I’d 
be able to.” 

“Well,” Ware said, ‘hut you are, 
after all, charged with the cure of 
souls; and unless the Church has 
done another flipflop since the last 

IP 




VII 



Congress, it is still also a mortal sin 
to assume that any man is certainly 
damned — even me.” 

That argument was potent, it had 
to be granted; but Fr. Domenico had 
not been trained in casuistry, and 
that by Jesuits, for nothing. 

“I’m a monk, not a priest,” he 
said. “And any information I give 
you would, on the contrary, almost 
certainly be used to abet <^e evil, 
not turn it aside. I don’t find the 
choice a hard one under the circum- 
stances.” 

“Then let me suggest a more prac- 
tical consideration,” Ware said. “I 
don’t know yet what Baines intends, 
but I do know well enough that I 
am not a Power myself — only an 
Agent. I have no desire to bite off 
more than I can chew.” 

“Now you’re jusit wheedling,” Fr. 
Domenico said, with energy. “Know- 
ing your own limitations is not an 
exercise at which I or anyone else 
can help you. You’ll just have to 
weigh (tibem in the light of Mr. 
Baines’s commission, whatever that 
proves to be. In the meantime, I 
shall tell you nothing.” 

“Very weU,” Ware said, rising. “I 
will be a little more generous with 
my information. Father, than you 
have been with yours. I will tell you 
that you will be well advised to ad- 
here to every letter of the Covenant. 
One step over the line, one toe, and 
/ shall have you — and hardly any 
outcome in this world would give 
me greater pleasure. I’m sure I make 
myself clear.” 

Fr. Domenico could think of no 
reply; but none seemed to be neces- 
sary. 



A s Ware had sensed, Baines was 
indeed disturbed by the presence 
of Fr. Domenico and made a point 
of bringing it up as the first order 
of business. After Ware had ex- 
plained the monk’s mission and the 
Covenant under which it was being 
conducted, however, Baines felt 
somewhat relieved. 

“Just a nuisance, os you say, since 
he can’t actually intervene,” he de- 
cided. “In a way, I suppose my 
bringing Dr. Hess here with me is 
comparable — he’s only an observer, 
too, and fundamentally he’s probably 
just as hostile to your world-view 
as this holier-than-us fellow is.” 
“He’s not significantly holier 
than us,” Ware said with a slight 
smile. “I know something he doesn’t 
know, too; he’s in for a surprise in 
the next world. However, for the 
time being we’re stuck with 'him — 
for how long depends upon you. 
Just what is it you want this time, 
Mr. Baines?” 

“Two things, one depending on 
die other. The first is the death of 
Albert Stockhausen.” 

“The anti-matter theorist? That 
would be too bad; I rather like him, 
and besides, some of the work he 
does is of direct interest to me.” 
“You refuse?” 

“No, not immediately anyhow, but 
I’m now going to ask you what I 
promised I would ask on this occa- 
sion. What are you aiming at, any- 
how?” 

“Something very long-term. For 
the present, my lethal intentions for 
Dr. Stockhausen are strictly business- 



FAUST ALEPH-NULL

based. He’s nibbling at tibe edges of a 
soholiiim tihat my oompamy preseiDitily 
controls completely. It’s a manopoly 
of knowledge we don’t want to see 
broken.” 

“Do you think you can keep any- 
thing secret that’s based in natur^ 
law? After the McCarthy fiasco 1 
should have supposed that any in- 
telligent American would know bet- 
ter. Surely Dr. Stockhausen can’t be 
just verging on some mere tech- 
nicality — something your firm 
might eventually bracket with a salvo 
of process patents.” 

“No, it’s in the realm of natural 
law and hence not patentable at all,” 
Baines admitted. “And we already 
know that it can’t be concealed for- 
ever. But we need about five years’ 
grace to make the best use of it, 
and we know that nobody else but 
Stockhausen is even close to it. Bar- 
ring accidents, of course. We our- 
selves have nobody of Stockhausen’s 
caliber; we just fell over it, and 
somebody else inigbt do that. How- 
ever, that’s highly unlikely.” 

“I see. Well . the project does 
have an attractive side. I think it’s 
quite possible that I can persuade 
Father Domenico that this is the 
project he came to observe. Obvious- 
ly it can’t be — I’ve run many like 
it and never attracted Monte Alba- 
no’s interest to this extent before — 
but given sufficient show of great 
preparations, and difficulty of exe- 
cution, he might be deluded, and go 
home.” 

“That would be useful,” Baines 
agreed. “The question is could he 
be deceived?” 

“It’s worth trying. The task would 



in fact be difficult — and qtiite ex- 
pensive.” 

“Why?” Jack Ginsberg said, sit- 
ting bolt upright in his carved Flor- 
entine chair so suddenly as to make 
bis suit squeak against the silk up- 
holstery. “Don’t tell us he affects 
thousa^s of other people. Nobody 
ever oast any votes for him that I 
know of.” 

“Shut up. Jack.” 

wait, it’s a reasonable 
question,” Ware said. “Dr. 
Stockhausen does have a large fam- 
Dy, which I have to take into ac- 
count. And, as I’ve told you, I’ve 
taken some pleasure in his company 
on a few occasions — not enough 
to balk at having him sent for, but 
enough to help run up the price. 

“But that’s not the major impedi- 
ment. The fact is that Dr. Stockhau- 
sen, like a good many theoretical 
physicists these days, is a devout 
Qxan — and furthermore, he has 
only a few venial sins to account 
for, nothing in the least meriting the 
attention of Hell. I’ll check that 
again with Someone who knows, but 
it was accurate as of six months ago, 
and I’d be astonished if there’s been 
any change. He’s not a member of 
any formal congregation, but even 
so he’s nobody a demon could rea- 
sonably have come for him — and 
there’s a chance that he might be 
defended against any direct assault.” 

“Successfully?” 

“It depends on the forces involved. 
Do you w!ant to risk a pitched battle 
that would tear up half of Duessel- 
dorf? It might be cheaper just to mail 
him a bomb.”

“No, no. And I don’t want any- 
thing that might look like some 
kind of laboratory accident — thaifd 
be just the kind of clue that would 
set everybody else in his field haring 
after what we want to keep hiddecu 
The whole secret lies in the fact 
that once Stockhausen knows what 
we know, he could create a major ex- 
plosion with — well, with the equi- 
valent of a blackboard and two 
pieces of chalk. Isn’t there any other 
way?” 

“Men being men, there’s always 
another way. In this instance, thou^. 
I’d have to have him tempted. I 
know at least one promising avenue. 
But he might not fall; and even if 
he did, as I think he would, it would 
take several months and a lot of 
close monitoring. Which wouldn’t 
be altogether intolerable either, since 
it would greatly help to mislead 
Father Domenico.” 

“What would it cost?” Jack Gins- 
berg said. 

“Oh — say about eight million. 
Entirely a contingent fee this time, 
since I can’t see that there’d be any 
important out-of-pocket money need- 
ed. If there is. I’ll absorb it.” 

“That’s nice,” Jack said. Ware 
took no notice of the feeble sar- 
casm. 

Baines put on his adjudicatory 
face, but inwardly he was well satis- 
fied. As a further test, the death of 
Dr. Stockhausen was not as critical 
as that of Gov. Rogan, but it did 
have the merit of being in an en- 
tirely different social sphere; the 
benefits to Consolidated Warfare 
Service would be real enough, so 
that Baines had not had to counter- 



feit a motive, which might have 
been detected by Ware a^ led to 
premature further questions; and fi- 
nally, the objections Ware had 
rais^, while in part unexpected, had 
been entirely consistent with every- 
thing the magician had said befdr^ 
eveiything that he appeared to be, 
everything that his style proclaimed, 
despite the fact that he was obviously 
a complex man. 

Good. Baines liked consistent in- 
tellectuals and wished that he had 
more of them in his organization. 
They were always fanatics of some 
sort when the chips were down, and 
hence presented him with some large 
and easily grasped handle predsely 
when he had most need of it. Ware 
hadn’t exhibited his handle yet, but 
he would; he would. 

“It’s worth it,” Baines said, with- 
out more than a decorous two sec- 
onds of apparent hesitation. ‘T do 
want to remind you, though. Dr. 
Ware, that Dr. Hess here is one of 
my conditions. I want you to allow 
him to watch 'vriiile you operate.” 

“Oh, very gladly,” Ware said, with 
(another smile that, this time, Baines 
found disquieting. It seemed false, 
even unctuous, and Ware was too 
much in command of himself to have 
meant the falsity not to be noticed. 
“I’m sure he’ll enjoy it. You can 
all watch, if you like. I may even 
invite Fa^er Domenico.” 

vm 

D r. Hess arrived punctually the 
next morning for his appoint- 
ment to be shown Ware’s workroom 
and equipment. Greeting him with a

professional nod — “Coals to New- 
castle, biingiiig iMitford and me up 
here for a tertitary,” Hess found him- 
self quoting in silent inanity — 
Ware led the way to a pair of heavy 
brocaded hangings behind his desk, 
which parted to reveal a heavy 
brass-bound door of what was ap- 
parently cypress wood. Among its 
fittings was a huge knocker with a 
face a little like the mask of tragedy, 
except that the eyes had cat-like 
pupils in them. 

Hess had thought himself prepar- 
ed to notice everything and be sur- 
prised by nothing, but he was taken 
aback when the expression on the 
knocker changed, slightly but in- 
arguably, when Ware touched it. Ap- 
parently expwting bis startlement. 
Ware said without looking at him: 
“There’s nothing in here really 
worth stealing, but if anything were 
taken it would cost me a tremendous 
amount of trouble to replace it, no 
matter how worthless it would prove 
to the thief. Also, there’s the prob- 
lem of contamination. Just one 
ignoiant touch could destroy the 
work of months. It’s rather like a 
bacteriology laboratory in tha;t re- 
spect Hence the guardian.” 

“Obviously there can’t be a stan- 
dard supply house for your tools,” 
Hess agreed, recovering his compo- 
sure. 

“No, that’s not even theoretioailly 
possible. The operator must make 
everything himself — not as easy 
now as it was in the Middle Ages, 
when most educated men had the re- 
quisite skills as a matter of course. 
Here we go.” 

The door swung back as if being 



opened from the inside, slowly and 
soundlessly. At first it opened on a 
deep scarlet gloom; but Ware touch- 
ed a switch, and with a brief rushing 
sound, like waiter, sunlight flooded 
the room. 

Immediately Hess could see why 
Ware had rented this particular 
palazzo and no other. The room 
was an immense refectory of Sienese 
design, which in its heyday must 
often have banqueted as many as 
thirty nobles; there could not be 
another one half as big in Positano, 
though the palazzo as a whole was 
smaller than some. There were mul- 
lioned windows overhead, under the 
ceiling, running around all four 
walls, and the sunlight was pouring 
through two ranks of them. They 
were flanked by pairs of red velvet 
drapes, unpaittemed, hung from tra- 
verse rods; it had been these that 
Hess had heard pulling back when 
Ware had flipped the wall-switch. 

At the rear of the room was an- 
other door, a broad one also covered 
by hangings, which Hess supposed 
must lead to a parLtry or kitchen. To 
the left of this was a medium-sized 
modem electric furnace and beside 
it an anvil bearing a hammer which 
looked almost too heavy for Ware 
to lift. On the other side of the 
furnace from the anvil were several 
graduated tubs which obviously 
served as quenching baths. 

To the right of the door was a 
black-topped chemisifs bench, com- 
plete with sinks, running water and 
the usual noz2des for illumiiiaiting 
gas, vacuum and compressed air; 
Ware must have had to install his 
own pumps for all of these. Over

the bench on the back wall were 
shelves of reagents; to the right, on 
the side wall, ranks of drying pegs, 
some of whidh bore contorted pieces 
of glassware, others, coils of rubber 
tubing. 

Farther along that wall toward 
the front was a lectern bearing a 
book as big as an unabridged dic- 
tionary, bound in red leather and 
closed and locked with a strap. 
There was a circular design chased 
in gold on the front of the book, 
but at this distance Hess could not 
make out what it was. The lectern 
was flanked by two standing candle- 
sticks with fat candles in them. The 
candles had been extensively used, 
although there were shaded electric 
light fixtures around the walls, too, 
and the small writing table next to 
the lectern born a Tensor lamp. On 
the table was another book, smaller 
but almost as thick, which Hess 
recognized at once: the Handbook of 
Chemistry and Physics, 47th Edition, 
as stand^d a laWatory fixture as 
a test tube, and a rank of quill pens 
and inkhoms. 

CC'VJow you can see something of 
what I meant by requisite 
skSUs,” Ware said. “Of course I blow 
modh of my own glassware, but any 
oriSmry chemist does that But 
should 1 need a new sword, for in- 
stance — ” he pointed toward the 
electric furnace — “I have to forge 
it myself; I couldn’t just pick one 
up at a costume shop. Fd have to do 
a good job of it, too. As a modem 
writer says somewhere, the only 
really serviceable symbol for a 
sharp sword is a sharp sword.” 



“Uhm,” Hess said, continuing to 
look around. Against the left wall, 
opposite the lectern, was a long, 
heavy table, bearing a neat ranking 
of objects ranging in length from 
six inches to about three feet, all 
closely wrapped in red silk. The 
wrappers had writing on them, but 
again Hess could not decipher it. 
Beside the table, affixed to the wall, 
was a flat sword-cabinet. A few 
stools completed the furnishings; 
evidently Ware seldom worked sit- 
ting down. The floor was parqueted 
and, toward the center of the room, 
still bore traces of marks in colored 
chalks, considerably scuffed, which 
brought from Ware a grunt. 

“The wrapped instruments are all 
prepared and Fd rather not expose 
them,” the magioian said, walking 
toward 'the sword-rack, “but of 
course 1 keep a set of spares and I 
can show you those.” 

He opened the cabinet door, re- 
vealing la set of blades hung in order 
of size. There were thirteen of them. 
Some were obviously swards; others 
looked more like shoemaker’s tools. 

“The order in which you make 
these is important, too,” Ware said, 
“because as you can see, most of 
them have writing on them, and it 
makes a difference what instrument 
does the writing. Hence I began 
with the uninscribed instrument, this 
one, the bolline or sickle, which is 
also one of the most often used. 
Rituals differ, but the one I used re- 
quires starting with la piece of un- 
used steel. It’s fired three times and 
then quenched in a mixture of mag- 
pie’s blood and the juice of a herb 
called fbirole.” 



114 



IF 




“The Grimorium Verum says 
mole’s blood and pimpernel juice,” 
Hess observed. 

“Ah, good, you’ve been doing 
some reading. I’ve tried that, and it 
just doesn’t seem to give quite as 
good an edge.’’ 

“I should think you could get a 
still better edge by finding out what 
specific compounds were essential 
and using those,” Hess said. “You’ll 
remember that Damascus steel used 
to be tempered by plunging the 
sword into the body of a slave. It 
worked, but modem quenching 
baths are a lot better — and in your 
case you wouldn’t have to be con- 
stantly having to trap elusive ani- 
mals in large numbers.” 

“The analogy is incomplete,” 
Ware said. “It would hold if temper- 
ing were the only end in view, or if 
the operation were only another ob- 
servance of Paracelsus’ rule, Alterius 
non sit qui suns esse potest — do- 
ing for yourself what you can’t trust 
others to do. Both are practical ends 
that I might satisfy in some quite 
different way. But in magic the 
blood sacrifice has lan additional 
function; what we might call the 
tempering of, not just the steel, but 
also the operator.” 

“I see. And I suppose it has some 
symbolic functions, too.” 

“In Goeitic art, everything does. 
In the same way, as you probably 
also know from your reading, the 
forging and quenching is to be done 
on a Wednes^y in either the first or 
the eighth of the day hours, or the 
third or the tenth of the nigjht hours, 
under a full Moon. There is again 
an immediate practical interest be- 



ing served here — for I assure you 
that the planetary hours do indeed 
effect affairs on Earth — but also a 
psychological one, the obedience of 
the operator in every step. The 
Grimoires and other texts are at best 
so confused and contradictory that 
it’s never possible to know complete- 
ly what steps are essential and what 
aren’t, and research into the subject 
seldom makes for a long life.” 

“All right,” Hess said. “Go on.” 

44TXTelI, the horn handle has 
VV next to be shaped and fitted, 
again in a particular way at a par- 
ticular hour and then perfected at 
still another day and hour. By the 
way, you mentioned a different 
steeping bath; if you use that ritual, 
the days and the hours are also dif- 
ferent, and again the question is, 
what’s essential and what isn’t? 
Thereafter, there’s a conjuration to 
be recited, plus three salutations and 
a warding spell; then the instrument 
is sprinkled, wrapped and fumigated 
— not in the modem sense, I mean 
it’s perfumed — and is ready to 
use. After it’s used, it has to be 
exorcised and rededicated, and that’s 
the difference between the wrapped 
tools on the table and those han^ng 
here in the rack. 

“I won’t go into detail about the 
preparation of the other instruments. 
The next one I make is the pen of 
the Art, followed by toe inkpots 
and toe inks, for obvious reasons; 
and, for toe same reasons, toe buiin 
or graver. The pen is on my desk;

mamif aoture, are the rwhite-handled 
knife, which like the boUine is near- 
ly an all-purpose tool; the black- 
handled knife, used almost solely for 
inscribing the circle; the stylet, <^ef- 
ly for preparing the wooden knives 
used in tanning; the wand or blasting 
rod, which describes itself; the lancet, 
again self-descriptive; the staff, a 
restraining instrument analogous to 
a shepherd’s; and lastly the four 
swords, one for the master, the other 
three for his assistants, if any.” 

Hess leaned forward, with a side 
glance at Ware for permission, to in- 
spect the writing on the graven in- 
struments. Some of them were easy 
enough to make out: on the sword 
of the master, for instance, the word 
Michael appeared on the pommel, 
and on the blade, running from 
point to hilt, Elohim Gibor. On the 
other hand, on the handle of the 
white-^handled knife was engraved 
the following: 

Hess pointed to this and to a dif- 
ferent but equally baffling inscrip- 
tion which was duplicated on the 
handles of the stylet and ithe lancet. 
“What do those mean?” 

“Mean? They can hardly be said 
to mean anything any more. They’re 
greatly degenerate Hebrew charac- 
ters, originally comprising various 
Divine Names. I could tell you what 
the Names were once, but the char- 
acters have no content any more — 
they just have to be there.” 

“Superstition,” Hess said, recalling 
his earlier conversation with Baines, 



interpreiting Ware’s remark about 
ChrositiDas. 

‘Tiredsely, in the pure sense. The 
process is as fundamental to the Art 
as evolution is to biology. Now if 
you’ll step this way I’ll show you 
some other aspects that may interest 
you.” 

He led the way diagonally across 
the room to the ohemisfs bench, 
pausing to rub irritatedly at the 
chalk marks with the sole of his 
slipper. “1 suppose a modem trans- 
lation of that ap>horism of Paracel- 
sus,” he said, “would be, ‘You just 
can’t get good servants any more.’ 
Not to ply mops, anyhow .... Now: 
most of these reagents will be fa- 
milar to you, but some of them are 
special to the Art. This, for instance, 
is exorcised waiter, which as you see 
1 need in great quantities; it has to 
be river-water to start with. The 
quicklime is for tanning; some lay- 
men, de Camp for instance, will tell 
you that ‘virgin parchment’ simply 
means parchment that’s never been 
written on befbre, but that’s not so 
— all the Grimoires insist that it 
must be the skin of a male animal 
which has never engendered, and the 
Clavicula Salomonis sometimes in- 
sists upon imbom parchment, or 
the caul of a newborn child. For 
tanning I also have to grind my 
own salt, after the usual rites are 
said over it. The candles I use have 
to be made of the first wax taken 
from a new hive, and so do my al- 
madels. If I need images, I have to 
make them of earth dug up with my 
bare 'bands and reduced to a paste 
without any tool. And so on. 

“I’ve mentioned aspersion and

fumigation, in other words sprink- 
ling and perfuming. Sprinkling has 
to be done with an laspergillus, a 
bundle of herbs like a faggot or 
bouquet garni; the herbs differ from 
rite to rite, and you can see I’ve got 
a fair selection here — mint, mar- 
jory, rosemary, vervain, periwinkle, 
sage, valerian, ash, bash, hyssop. In 
fumigation the most commonly used 
scents are these: aloes, incense, mace, 
benzoin, storax; also, it’s sometimes 
necessary to make a stench — for in- 
stance in the fumigation of a caul — 
and I’ve got quite a repertoire of 
those.” 

Ware turned away abruptly, nearly 
treading on Hess’ toes, and strode 
toward the exit. Hess had no choice 
but to follow him. 

“Everything involves special prep- 
aration,” he said over his shoulder, 
“even including the firewood if I 
want to make ink for pacts. But 
there’s no point in my cataloguing 
things further, since I’m sure you 
thoroughly understand the princi- 
ples.” 

H ess scurried after, but he was 
still several paces behind the 
magician when the window-drapes 
swished closed and the red gloom 
was reinstated. Ware stopped and 
waited for him, and the moment he 
was through the door, closed it and 
went back to his seat behind the 
big desk. Hess, puzzled, walked 
around the desk and took one of 
the Florentine chairs reserved for 
guests or clients. 

“Most illuminating,” he said po- 
litely. “Thank you.” 

“You’re welcome.” Ware rested 



his elbows on the desk and put his 
fingertips over his mouth, looking 
down thougthitfully. There was a 
sprinkle of perspiration over his 
brow and shaven head, and he seem- 
ed more than usually pale; also, Hess 
noticed after a moment, he seemed 
to be trying, without major effort^ 
to control his breathing. Hess watch- 
ed curiously, wondering what' could 
have upset him. After only a mo- 
ment, however. Ware looked up at 
him and volunteered the explana- 
tion, with an easy half-smile. 

“Excuse me,” he said. “From ap- 
prenticeship on, we’re trained to 
secrecy. I’m perfectly convinced that 
it’s unnecessary these days, and has 
been since the Inquisition died, but 
old oaths are the hardest to reason 
away. No discourtesy intended.” 

“No offense taken,” Hess assur- 
ed him. “However, if you’d radier 
rest — ” 

“No, I’ll have ample rest in the 
next three days and be incom- 
municado too, preparing for Mr. 
Baines’s commission. So if you’ve 
further questions, now’s the time for 
them.” 

“Well ... I have no further tech- 
nical questions, for the moment. But 
I am curious about a question Baines 
asked you during your first meeting 
— I needn’t pretend, I’m sure, that 
I haven’t heard the tape. I wonder 
just as he did what your motivation 
is. I can see from what you’ve shown 
me, and from everything you’ve 
said, that you’ve t^en colossal 
amounts of trouble to perfect your- 
self in your Art and that you believe 
in it; so it doesn’t matter for the 
present whether or not I believe in

he thinks important. 1 confess 1 
came to scoff — and to expose you, 
if I could — and I still can’t credit 
that lany of what you do works, or 
ever did work. But I accept that you 
so believe.” 

Ware gave him a half-nod. 
“Thank you; go on.” 

‘Tve no farther to go but the 
fundamental question. You don’t 
really need money; you don’t seem 
to collect art or women; you’re not 
out to 'be President of i^e World 
or the power behind some such per- 
son — and yet by your lights you 
have damned yourself eternally to 
make yourself expert in this highly 
peculiar subject. What on earth for?” 

“I could easily duck that ques- 
tion,” Ware said slowly. “I could 
point out, for instance, that under 
certain circumstances I could pro- 
long my life to seven hundred years, 
and so might not be worrying just 
yet about what might happen to me 
in the next world. 

“Or else I could easily point 
out what you already know from 
the texts, that every magician hopes 
to cheat Hell in the end — as sever- 
al did who are now nicely ensconced 
on the calendar las authentic saints. 

“But the real fact of the matter. 
Dr. Hess, is that I think what I’m 
after is worth the risk, and what 
I’m after is something you under- 
stand perfectly, and for which you’ve 
sold your own soul, or if you prefer 
an only slightly less loaded word. 



your integrity, to Mr. Baines: Knowl- 
edge.** 

“Uhmn. Surely there must be 
easier ways — ” 

“You don’t believe that. You 
think there may be more reliable 
ways, such as scientific method, but 
you don’t think they’re any easier. I 
myself have the utmost respect for 
scientific method, but I know that 
it doesn’t offer me the kind of knowl- 
edge I’m looking for — which is 
also knowledge about the make-up 
of the universe and how it is run, 
but not a kind that any exact sci- 
ence can provide me with, because 
the sciences don’t accept that some 
of the forces of nature are Per- 
sons. Well, but some of them are; 
and without dealing with those Per- 
sons I shall never know any of the 
things I wiant to know. 

“This kind of research is just as 
expensive as underwriting a gigantic 
particle-accelerator. Dr. Hess, and 
obviously I’ll never get any govern- 
ment to underwrite it. But people 
like Mr. Bjaines can, if I can find 
enough of them. Just as they un- 
denvrite you. 

“Eventually, I may have to pay 
for what I’ve learned with a jewel 
no amount of money could buy. Un- 
like Macbeth, I know one can*t ‘skip 
the life to come.’ But even if it does 
come to that. Dr. Hess — and prob- 
ably it will — I’ll take my knowl- 
edge with me, and it will have been 
worth the price. 

“In other words — just as you 
suspected — I’m a fanatic.” 

To his own dawning astonishment, 
Hess said slowly: 

“Yes. Yes, of course. So am I.”

F ather Domenico lay in ibis 
strange bed on his stalling 
sleeplessly up ait the pink stucco 
ceiling. Tonight was the nighit he 
had come for. Ware’s three days of 
fasting, lustration and prayer — 
surely a blasphemous burlesque of 
such observances as the ^urch 
knew them, in intent if not in con- 
tent — were over, and he had pro- 
nounced himself ready to act 
Apparently, he still intended to 
allow Baines and his two repulsive 
henchmen to observe the conjuration, 
but if he had ever had any iintention 
of including Fr. Domenico in the 
ceremony, he had thought better of 
it. That was fnistrating, as well as 
a great relief; but in his place, Fr. 
Domenico would have done the same 
thing. 

Yet even here, excluded from the 
scene and surrounded by every pro- 
tection he had been able to muster, 
Fr. Domenico could feel the prelimi- 
nary oppression, Mke the dead weath- 
er ^fore an earthquake. There was 
always a similar hush and tension 
in the air just before the invocatian 
of one of the celestial powers, but 
with none of these overtones of 
maleficence and disaster . • or 
would someone ignorant of what was 
actually proposed be able to tell the 
difference? That was a disquieting 
thought in itself, but one that could 
practically be left to Bishop Berkeley 
and the logical positivists. Fr. Do- 
menico knew what was going on: a 
ritual of supernatural murder; and 
he could not help but tremble. 
Somewhere in the palazzo there 



was the silvetry sound of a small 
dock strikinig, distant and sweet. The 
tune was inow 10:00 pjn., the fourth 
hour of Saitum on the day of Saturn, 
the hour most suitable — as even the 
blameless and pitiable Peter de 
Abano had written — for experi- 
ments of hatred, enmity and dis- 
cord; and Fr. Domenico, under the 
Covenant, was forbidden even to 
pray for failure. 

e clock, that two-handed engine 
that stands behind the Door, 
struck, and struck no more, and 
Ware drew the brocade han^gs 
aside. 

Up to now, Baines despite himself 
had felt a little foolish in the girdled 
white linen garment Ware in- 
sisted upon, but he cheered up upon 
seeing Jack Ginsberg and Dr. Hess 
in the same vestments. As for Ware, 
he was either oomioal or terrible, 
depending upon what view one took 
of the proceedings, in his white 
leather shoes letter^ in dnnaibar 
and his paper crown bearing the 
word EL. He was girdled with a belt 
about three inches wide which seem- 
ed to have been made from the skin 
of some hairy, lion-colored animal. 
Into the gir^e was thrust a red- 
wrapped, sceptorlike object which 
Baines identified tentativdy from a 
prior description of Hess’s as the 
wand of power. 

“And now we must vest our- 
selves,” Ware said, almost in a whis- 
per. “Dr. Baines, on the desk you 
will find three garments. Take one, 
and then another, and 'mother; give 
two to Dr. Hess and Mr. Ginsberg; 
don the other yourself.”

Baines picked up the huddle of 
cloth. It turned out to be an alb. 

‘*Take up your vestmenits lift 
them in your hands above your 
heads. At the Amen, let them fall. 
Now: 

“Anton, Amator, Emites, The- 

ODONIEL, PONCOR, PaGOR, AmTOR;

their term, all things which I desire 
to effect (through Thee, Ideodaniach, 
Pamor, Plaior, Lord of Lords, 
Whose kingdom and rule endureth 
forever and ever. Amen** 

The garments rustled down, and 
Ware opened the door. 

The room beyond was only vague- 
ly lit with yeUow candle-li^t and 
at first bore almost no resemblance 
to the chamber Dr. Hess had des- 
cribed to Baines. As his eyes accom- 
modated, however, Baines was grad- 
ually able to see that it wias the 
same room, its margins now >in- 
disitinct and its furniture slightly dif- 
ferently ordered; only the lectern 
and the candlesticks — there were 
now four of them, not two — were 
moved out from the walls and hence 
more or less visible. 

But it was still confusing, a welter 
of flickering shadows and slightly 
sickening perfume, most unlike the 
blueprint of the room that Baines 
had erected in his mind from Hess’s 
drawing. The thing that dominated 
the real room itself was also a draw- 
ing, not any piece of furniture or de- 
tail of architecture: a vast double 
circle on the floor in what appeared 
to be whitewash. Between the con- 



centric circles were written innumer- 
able words, or what might have been 
words, in characters which might 
have been Hebrew, Greek, Etruscan 
or even Elvish for all Baines could 
tell; some few were also in Roman 
lettering, but they too were names 
he could not recognize; and around 
the outside of the outer circle were 
written astrological signs in their 
zodiacal order, but with Saturn to 
the north. 

At the very center of this figure 
was a rule square about two feet on 
a side, from each comer of which 
proceeded chalk, conventionalized 
crosses which did not look in the 
least Christian. Proceeding from each 
of these, but not connected to them, 
were four six-pointed stars, verging 
on the innermost circle. The stars at 
the east, west and south each had a 
Tau scrawled at its center; presum- 
ably the Satummost did too, but if 
so it could not be seen, for the heart 
of that emplacement was hidden by 
what seem^ to be a fat puddle of 
stippled fur. 

Outside the circles, at the oth^ 
compass-points, were drawn four 
pentagrams, in the chords of which 
were written TE TRA GRAM MA 
TON, and at the centers of which 
stood the candles. Farthest away 
from all this — about two feet out- 
side the circle and three feet over 
it to the north — was a circle en- 
closed by a triangle, also much let- 
tered inside and out; Baines could 
just see that the characters in the 
angles read, NI CH EL. 

“Tanists,” Ware whispered, point- 
ing into the circle, “take your 
places.”

He weDit toward the long table 
Hess had described and vaoished in 
the gloom. As instructed^ Baines 
walked into the circle and stood in 
the western star; Hess followed, 
taking the eastern; and Ginsberg, 
very slowly, crept into the southern. 
To the north, the puddle of fur re- 
volved once widdershins and re- 
settled itself with an unsettling sigh, 
making Jack Ginsberg jump. Baines 
inspected it belatedly. Probably it 
was only a cat, as was supposed to 
be traditional, but in this light it 
looked more like a badger. What- 
ever it was, it was obscenely fat. 

W are reappeared, carrying a 
sword. He entered the circle, 
closed it with the point of the sword, 
and proceeded to the central square, 
where he lay the sword across the 
toes of his white shoes; then he drew 
the wand from his belt and 
unwrapped' it, laying the red silk 
cloth across his shoulders. 

“From now on,” he said, in a 
normal, even voice, “no one is to 
move.” 

From somewhere inside his vest- 
ments, he produced a small crucible, 
which he set at his feet before the 
recumbent sword. Small blue flames 
promptly began to rise from the 
bowl, and Ware cast incense into it. 
He said: 

“Holocaust. Holocaust. Holo- 
caust.” 

The flames in the brazier rose 
slighitly. 

“We are to call upon Marchosias, 
a great marquis of the Descending 
Hierarchy,” Ware said in the same 
conversational voice. “Before he 



fell, he belonged to the Onto of 
Dominations among the angels and 
thinks to return to the Seven Thrones 
after twelve hundred yeiars. His vir- 
tue is that he gives true answers. 
Stand fast, all.” 

With a sudden motion. Ware 
thrust the end of his rod into the 
surging flames of the brazier. At 
once, the air of the hall rang with 
a long, frightful chain of woeful 
howls. Above the bestial clamor. 
Ware shouted: 

“I abjure thee, great Marchosias, 
as the agent of the Emperor Luci-

intelligences who shall constrain

The noise rose higher, and a 
green steam began to come off the 
brazier. It smelt like someone was 
burning hart’s horn and fishgah. But 
there was no other answer. His face 
white and cruel, Ware rasped over 
the tumult: 

“I adjure thee, Marchosias, by 
the pact, and by the Names, appear 
instanter!” He plunged the rod a 
second time into the flames. The 
room screamed; but still there was 
no apparition. 

“Now I adjure thee, Lucifuge 
Rofocale whom I command, as the 
agent of the Lord and Emperor of 
Lords, send me thy messenger

Marchosias, forcing tiam to forsake 
his hiding-place, wheresoever it may 
be; land warning ithee — ” 

The rod went back into the fire. 
Instantly, the palazzo rocked as 
though earth had moved under 
it. 

“Stand fasti” Ware said hoarsely. 

Something Else said: 

Hush, I am here. What dost 
Thou Seek of me? Why dost 
THOU Disturb my repose? Let my 
Father rest, and hold thy rod. 

Never had Baines heard a voice 
like that before. It seemed to speak 
in syllables of burning ashes. 

“Hadst thou appeared when first 
I invoked thee, 1 had by no means 
smitten thee, nor called thy father,” 
Ware said. “Remember, if the re- 
quest 1 make of thee be refused, 1 
^all thrust again my rod into the 
fire.” 

Think and seeI 

The palazzo shuddered again. 
Then, from the middle of the triangle 
to the north-west, a slow cloud of 
yellow fumes went up toward the 
ceiling, making them all cough, even 
Ware. As it spread and thinned, 
Baines could see a shape forming 
under it; but he found it impossible 
to believe. It was — it was some- 
thing like a she wolf, gray and im- 
mense, with green and glistering eyes. 
A wave of coldness was coming from 
it. 

The cloud continued to dissipate. 
The fihe^wolf glared at them, slowly 
spreading her griffin’s wings. Her 
serpent*s tall lashed gently, scalily. 

In the northmi pentacle, the great 
cat sat up and stared back. The 
demon-wolf showed her teeth and 



emitted a disgusting belch of fire. 
The cat settled its front feet in- 
differently. 

“Stand, by the Seal,” Ware said. 
“Stand and transform, else 1 shall 
plunge thee back whence thou 
earnest. I command diee.” 

T he she-wolf vanished, leaving 
behind in the triangle a modest- 
looking young man wearing a deco- 
rous nedotie, a dildo almost as long, 
and nothing else. “Sorry, boss,” ho 
said in a sugary voice. “1 hM to 
try, you know. What’s up?” 

“Don’t try .to wheedle me, vision 
of stupidity,” Ware said harshly, 
‘Transform, 1 demand of thee, 
thou’rt wasting they father’s time, 
and mine! TransformI” 

The young man stuck out his 
tongue, which was copper-green. A 
moment later, the triangle was oc- 
cupied by a black-bearded man ap- 
parently twice his age, wearing a 
green robe trimmed in ermine and 
a Ottering crown it hurt Baines’s 
eyes to look at. An odor of sandal- 
wood began slowly to diffuse throu^ 
the room. 

“That’s better,” Ware said. “Now 
I charge thee, by those Names I 
have named and on pain of those 
torments thou hast known, regard 
the likeness and demesne of that 
mortal whose eidolon I hold in my 
mind; and that when 1 release thee, 
thou shalt straightaway go unto him, 
not making thyself known unto him, 
but revealing os it were to come 
from bis own intellectual soul a 
vision and understanding of that 
great and ultimate Nothingness 
which lurks behind those signs he

calls matter and energy^ as thou 
wMt see iit in his privaite forebodings; 
land that thou remiainest wiith him 
and deepen his despair without re- 
mittal, until such time as he shall 
despise his soul for its endeavors, 
and destroy the life of his body.” 
“I cannot give thee,” the crowned 
figure said, in a voice deep but 
somehow lacking all resonance, 
“what thou requirest.” 

“Refusal will not avail thee,” 
Ware said, “for either shalt thou go 
incontinently and perform what 1 
command, or 1 shall m no wise dis- 
miss thee, but shall keep thee here 
unto my life’s end and torment thee 
daily, as thy father permitteth.” 

“^y life itself, though it last 
seven hundred years, is but a day 
to me,” said the crowned figure. 
Sparks issued from its nostrils as it 
spoke. “And thy torments but a 
farthing of those I have endured 
since ere the cosmic egg was hatch- 
ed and Eve invented.” 

For answer, Ware again stabbed 
the rod into the fire, which, Baines 
noted numbly, failed even to scorch 
it. But the crowned figure threw 
back its bearded head and howled 
desolately. Ware withdrew the rod, 
but only by a hand’s breadth. 

“I shall do as thou oommandest,” 
the creature said sullenly. Hatred 
oozed from it like lava. 

“Be it not performed exactly, I 
shall call thee up again,” Ware said. 
“But be it executed, for thy pay 
thou shalt carry off the immortal 
part of the subject thou shalt tempt, 
which is as yet spotless in the sight 
of Heaven, and a great prize.” 

“Biit not yet enough,” said the 



demon. “For thou must give me also 
somewhat of thin e hoard, as it is 
written in the pact” 

“Thou art slow to remember the 
pact,” Ware said. “But I would deal 
fairly with thee, knowing marquis. 
Here.” 

H e reached into his robe and 
drew out something minute and 
colorless which flashed in the can- 
dlelight. At first, Baines took it to 
be a diamond, but as Ware held it 
out, he recognized it as an opales- 
cent crystal tear-vase, the snaallest 
he had ever seen, stopper, contents 
and all. This Ware tossed, under- 
hand, out of the circle to the fuming 
figure, which to Baines’s new as- 
tonishment — for he had forgotten 
that what he was really looking at 
had first exhibited as a beast — 
caught it skillfully in its mouth and 
swallowed it. 

“Thou dost only tantalize March- 
osiAS,” the presence said “When I 
have thee in Hell, miagician, then 
shall I drink thee dry, though thy 
tears flow never so copiously.” 
“Thy threats are empty; I am not 
marked -for thee, shouldst thou see 
me in Hell forthever,” Ware said. 
“Enough, ungrateful monster; cease 
they witless plaudering and discharge 
thine errand; I dismiss thee.” 

The crowned figure snarled and 
then, suddenly, reverted to the form 
in which it had first showed itself. 
It vomited a great gout of fire, but 
the surge failed to pass the wall of 
the triangle; instead, it collected in 
a ball around the demon itself. 
Nevertheless, Baines could feel the 
heat against his face.

He raised his wand methodically. 

The floor inside the small cirde 
vanished. The apparition clashed its 
brazen wings and dropped like a 
stone. With a rending thunderclap, 
the floor healed seamlessly. 

Then there was silence. As the 
ringing in Baines’s ears died away, 
he became aware of a distant thrum- 
ming sound, as though someone had 
left a car idling in the street in front 
of the palazzo. Then he realized 
what it was: the great cat was pur- 
ring. It had watched the entire pro- 
ceedings with nothing more than 
grave interest. So, apparently, had 
Hess. Ginsberg seemed to be jitter- 
ing, but he was standing his ground. 
Although he had never seen Jack 
rattled before, Baines could hardly 
blame him; he hiniself felt sick and 
giddy, as though just the effort of 
looking at Marchosias had been 
equivalent to having scrambled for 
days up some Himalayan glacier. 

“It is over,” Ware said in a gray 
whisper. He looked very old. Taking 
up his sword, he cut the diagram 
circle with it. “Now we must wait. 
I will be in seclusion for two weeks; 
then we will consult again. The cir- 
cle is open; you may leave.” 

F ather Domenico heard the thun- 
derclap, distant and muffled, 
and knew that the sending had been 
made — and that he was forbidden, 
now as before, even to pray for the 
soul of the victim (or the patient, 
in Ware’s antiseptic Aristotelian 
terminology). Sitting up and swing- 
ing his feet over the edge of the bed, 
breathing with diMcidity in the 
musky, detumescent air, he walked 



unsteadily to his satchel and opened 
it. 

Why — that was the question — 
did God so tie his hands, why did He 
allow such a compromise as the 
Covenant at all? It suggested, at 
least, some limitation in His power 
unallowable by the firm dogma of 
Omnipotence, which it was a sin even 
to question; or at worst, some am- 
biguity in His relationship with Hell, 
one quite outside the revealed 
answers to the Problem of Evil. 

That last was a concept too terri- 
ble to bear thinking about. Probably 
it was attributable purely to the at- 
mosphere here; in any event, Fr. 
Domenico knew that he was in no 
spiritual or emotional condition to 
examine it now. 

He could, however, examine with 
possible profit a minor but related 
question: Was the evil just done the 
evil Fr. Domenico had been sent to 
oversee? There was every immediate 
reason to suppose that it was — and 
if it were, then Fr. Domenico could 
go home tomorrow, ravaged but con- 
valescent. 

On the other hand, it was possible 
— dreadful, but in a way also hope- 
ful — that Fr. Domenico had been 
commanded to HeUnmouith to await 
the emission of something worse. 
That would resolve the puzzling 
anomaly that Ware’s latest under- 
taking, abomniable though they all 
were, was for Ware not unusual. 
Much more important, it would ex- 
plain, at least in part, why the 
Covenant existed at all: in Tolstoi’s 
words, “God sees the truth, but 
waits.” 

And this question, at least, Fr.

Domenico need not simiply ponder, 
buit could actively submit to tihe Di- 
vine guidance, even here, even now, 
provided that he call upon no Pre- 
sences. That restriction was not pro- 
hibitive; what was he a magician 
for, if not to be as subtle in his 
works as in his praise? 

Ink-^hom, quill, straight-edge, three 
diEferent disl^ of different sizes cut 
from virgin cardboard — not an easy 
thing to come by — and the wrapped 
burin came out of the satchel and 
were arranged on top of his dres^ 
ser, which would serve well enough 
for a desk. On the cardboard disks 
he carefully inscribed three differ- 
ent scales: The A camerae of six- 
teen divine attributes, from bonitas 
to patientia; the T camerae of thirty 
attributes of things, from temporis 
to negatio; and the E camerae of the 
nine questions, from whether to how 
great. He centerpunched all three 
disiks with the burin, pinned them to- 
gether with a cufflink, and finally 
asperged the assembled Lull Engine 
with holy water from the satchel. 
Over it he said: 

“I conjure thee, O form of this 
instrument, by the authority of God 
the Father Almighty, by the virtue 
of Heaven and the stars, by that of 
the elements, by that of stones and 
herbs, and in like manner by the 
virtue of snowstorms, thunder and 
winds, and belike also by the virtue 
of the Ars magna in whose figure 
thou art drawn, that thou receive 
all power unto the performance of 
those things in the perfection of 
which we are concerned, the whole 
without trickery, falsehood or de- 
ception, by the command of God, 



Creator of the Angels and Emperor 
of the Ages. Damahii, Lumech, 
Gadal, Pancia, Veloas, Meorod, 
Lamidoch, Baldach, Anerethon, 
Mitraton, most holy angels, be ye 
wardens of this instrument. Domine, 
Deus mens, in te speravi . Con- 
fitebor tibi, Domine, in tow corde 
meo .... Quemadmodum desiderat 
cervus ad fontes aquarum . • 
Amen.” 

This said, Fr. Domenico took up 
the engine and turned the circles 
against each other. Lull’s great art 
was not easy to use; most of the 
possible combinations of any group 
of wheels were trivial, and it took 
reason to see which were important, 
and faith to see which were inspired. 
Nevertheless, it had one advantage 
over all other forms of scrying: it 
was not, in any strict sense, a form 
of magic. 

He turned the wheels at random 
the required number of times, and 
then, taking the outermost by its 
edge, shook It to the four quarters 
of the sky. He was almost afraid to 
look at the result. 

But on that very first essay, the 
engine had generated: 

PATIENCE / BECOMING / 
REALITY 

It was the answer he had both 
feared and hoped for. And it was, he 
realized with a subdued shock, the 
only answer he could have expected 
on Christmas Eve. 

He put the engine and the tools 
back in his satchel and crept away 
into the bed. In his state of over-ex- 
haustion and alarm, he did not ex- 
pert to sleep . but within two 
turns of the glass he was no longer

W are’s period of recovery did 
not last quite as long as he 
had prophesied. He was visibly up 
and about by Twelfth Night. By that 
time, Baines — though only Jack 
Ginsberg could see and read the 
signs — was chafing at the inaction. 
Jack had to remind him that in any 
event at least two months were sup- 
posed to pass before the suicide of 
Dr. Stockhausen could even be ex- 
pected and suggested that they all 
go back to Rome and to work in 
the interim. 

Baines shrugged the suggestion 
off. Whatever else was on his mind, 
it did not seem to involve Consoli- 
dated Warfare Service’s interests 
more than marginally ... or at least, 
the thought of business could not 
distract him beyond the making of 
a small number of daily telephone 
calls. 

The priest or monk or whatever 
he was, Fr. Domenico, was still in 
attendance too. Evidently he had not 
been taken in by the show. Well, that 
was Ware’s problem, presumably. 
All the same. Jack stayed out of 
sight of the cleric as much as pos- 
sible; having him around. Jack re- 
called in a rare burst of association 
with his Bronx childhood, was a 
little like being visited by a lunatical- 
ly Orthodox relative during a crucial 
marriage brokerage. 



Not so lunatic at that, though; 
for if magic really worked — as 
Jack had had to see^that iit did — 
then the whole tissue of metaphysi- 
cal assumptions Fr. Domenico stood 
for, from Moses through the Kab- 
balah to the New Testament, had to 
follow, as a matter of logic. After 
this occurred to Jack, he not only 
hated to see Fr. Domenico, but had 
nightmares in which he felt that Fr. 
Domenico was looking back at him. 

Ware himself, however, did not 
emerge officially, to be talked to, 
until his predicted fourteenth day. 
Then, to Jack’s several-sided dis- 
quietude, the first person he called 
into his office was Jack Ginsberg. 

Jack wanted to talk to Ware only 
slightly more than he wanted to talk 
to the bare-footed, silently cour- 
teous Fr. Domenico; and the effect 
upon Baines of Ware’s singling Jack 
out for the first post-conjuration in- 
terview, though under ordinary cir- 
cumstances it could have been dis- 
counted as minor, could not even be 
conjectured in Baines’s present odd 
state of mind. After a troubled hour, 
Jack took the problem to Baines, not 
even sure any more of his own deli- 
cacy in juggling such an egg. 

“Go '^ead,” was all Baines said. 
He continued to give Jack the im- 
pression of a man whose mind was 
not to be turned more than momen- 
tarily from some all-important 
thought. That was alarming, too, 
but there seemed to be nothing to be 
done about it. Setting his face into 
its business mold of pleasant atten- 
tiveness, over slightly clenched 
teeth. Jack marched up to Ware’s 
office.

The sunlight there was just as 
htiiighit and lumocent as ever» poudng 
direotly in fron^ the sea-siky on top 
o£ the oM. Jack felt slig^y more 
in contact with what he (had used 
ito think of as real life. In some hope 
of taking the initiative away from 
Ware and keeping it, he asked the 
magician even before sitting down: 
“Is there some news already?” 

“None at all,” Ware said. “Sit 
down, please. Dr. Stockhausen is a 
tough patient, as I warned you all 
at the beginning. It’s possible that 
he won’t fall at all, in which case a 
far more strenuous endeavor will be 
required. But in the meantime I’m 
assuming that he will, and that I 
therefore ought to start preparing 
for Dr. Baines’s next commission. 
That’s why I wanted to see you 
first.” 

“I haven’t any idea what Dr. 
Baines’s next commission is,” Jack 
said, “and if I did I wouldn’t tell 
you before he did.” 

“You have a remorselessly literal 
mind, Mr. Ginsberg. I’m not trying 
to pump you. I already know, and 
it’s enough for the time being, that 
Mr. Baines’s next commission will be 
something major; perhaps even a 
unique experiment in the history of 
the Art. Father Domenico’s con- 
tinued presence here suggests the 
same sort of thing. Very well, if I’m 
to tackle such a project. I’ll need 
assistants — and I have no remaining 
apprentices; they become ambitious 
very early and either make stupid 
technical mistakes or have to be ^s- 
missed for disobedience. Laymen, 
even sympathetic laymen, are equal- 
ly mischancy, simply because of their 



eagerness and ignorance; but if 
they’re highly intelligent, it’s some- 
times safe to use them. Sometimes. 
Given those disclaimers, that ex- 
plains why I allowed you and Dr. 
Hess to watch the Christmas Eve af- 
fair, not just Dr. Hess whom Dr. 
Baines had asked for; and why I 
want to talk to you now.” 

44 T see,” Jack said. “I suppose I 

JL should be flattered.” 

Ware sat back in his chair and 
raised his hands as if exasperated. 
“Not at all. I see that I’d better be 
blunt. I was quite satisfied with Dr. 
Hess’s potentialities and so don’t 
need to talk to him any more, ex- 
cept to instruct him. But I am none 
too happy with yours. You strike 
me as a weak reed.” 

“I’m no magician,” Jack said, 
holding onto his temper. “If there’s 
some hostility between us, it’s only 
fair to recognize that I’m not its 
sole cause. You went out of your 
way to insult me at our very first 
interview, only because I was nor- 
mally suspicious of your pretensions, 
as I was supposed to be, on behalf 
of my job. I’m not easily offended. 
Dr. Ware, but I’m more cooperative 
if people are reasonably polite to 
me,” 

**Siercor/* Ware said. The word 
meant nothing to Jack. “You keep 
thi nkin g I’m talking about public 
relations, and getting along with 
people, and all that goose-grease. 
Far from it. A little hatred never 
hurts the Art, and studied insult is 
valuable in dealing with demons — 
there are only a few who can be 
flattered to any profit, and the man 



128 



IF 




who can be flattered isn’t a man at 
all, he’s a dog. Do try to understand 
me, Mr. Ginsberg, \^^hat I’m talking 
about is neither your footling hos- 
tility nor your unexpectedly slow 
brains, but your rabbit’s courage. 
There was a moment during the last 
ceremony when I could see that you 
were going to step out of your ipost. 
You didn’t know it, but I had to par- 
alyze you, and I saved your life. If 
you had moved you would have en- 
dangered all of us, and had that 
happened I would have thrown you 
to Marchosias like an old bone. It 
wouldn’t have saved the purpose of 
the ceremony, but it would have kept 
the demon from gobbling up every- 
body else but Ahktoi.” 

“Ach — ?” 

“My familiar. The cat.” 

“Oh. Why not the cat?” 

“He’s on loan. He belongs to an- 
other demon — my patron. Do stop 
changing the subject, Mr. Ginsberg. 
If I’m going to trust you as a Tan- 
ist in a great work, I’m going to have 
to be reasonably sure that you’ll 
stand fast when I tell you to stand 
fast, no matter what you see or hear, 
and that when I ask you to take 
some small part in the ritual, you’ll 
do it accurately and punctually. Can 
you assure me of this?” 

“Well,” Jack said earnestly, “I’ll 
do my best.” 

“But what for? Why do you want 
to sell me? I don’t know what you 
mean by your ‘best* until I know 
what’s in it for you, besides just 
keeping you your job — or makin g 
a good impression on me because 
it’s a reflex with you to make a 
good impression on pec^le. Explain 



this to me, please! I know that there’s 
something in this situation that hits 
you where you live; I could see that 
from the outset, but my first guess 
as to what it was evidently was 
wrong, or anyhow not central. Well, 
what is centri to you? The situation 
has now ripened to the point when 
you’re going to have to tdl me 
what it is. Otherwise I shall shut 
you out, and that will be that.” 

Wobbling between unconventional 
hope and standard caution. Jack 
pushed himseilf out of the Florraitine 
chair and toe-heel-toed to the win- 
dow, adjusting his tie automatically. 
From this hei ght ^ the cliff- cling ing 
apartments of Positano fell away to 
the narrow beach like so many 
Roman tenements crowded with de- 
posed kings — and with beach-boys 
hoping to pick up an American 
heiress for the season. Except for the 
curling waves and a few distant birds, 
the scene was motionless, yet some- 
how to Jack it seemed to be slowly, 
inexorably sliding into the sea. 

Sure, I like women,” he said in a 
low voice. “And I’ve got special 
preferences I don’t find it easy to 
satisfy, even with all the money I 
make. For one thing, in my job I’m 
constantly working with classified 
material — secrets — either some 
government’s or the company’s. That 
means I don’t dare put myself into 
a position where I could be black- 
m^ed.” 

“Which is why you refused my 
offer when we first talked,” Ware 
said. “That was discreet, but un- 
necessary. As you’ve probably re- 
alized by now, neither spying nor 
extortion has any attraction for me

— the potential income from either 
or both would be a pittance to me.” 
“Yes, but I won’t always have you 
around,” Jack said, turning back 
toward the desk. “And I’d be stupid 
to form new tastes that only you 
could keep supplied.” 

“‘Pander to’ is the expression; 
let’s be precise. Nevertheless, you 
have some remedy in mind. Other- 
wise you wouldn’t be being even 
this frank.” 

“Yes ... I do. It occurred to me 
when 3 ^u agreed to allow Hess to 
tour your laboratory.” He was halted 
by lanolheir stab of jealousy, no less 
acute for being half reminiscent. 
Drawing a deep breath, he went on: 
“I want to learn the Art.” 

“Oho. That is a reversal.” 

Ci^T^ou said it was possible,” 
1 Jack said in a rusih, embold- 
ened by a desperate sense of having 
now nothing to lose, “I know you 
said you don’t take apprentices, but 
I wouldn’t be tr}^g to stab you in 
the back or take over your clients, 
I’d only be using the Art for my 
specialized purposes. I couldn’t pay 
you any fortune, but I do have 
money. I could do the reading in my 
spare time and come back after a 
year or so for the actual instruction. 
I think Baines would give me a 
stabbatical for that. He wants some- 
body on his staff to know the Art, 
at least the theory, only he thinks 
it’s going to be Hess. But Hess will 
be too busy with his own sciences 
to do a thorou^ job of it.” 

“You really hate Dr. Hess, don’t 
you?” 

“We don’t impinge,” Jack said 



stiffly. “Anyhow what I say is true; 
I could be a lot better expert from 
Baines’s" point of view than Hess ever 
could.” 

“Do you have a sense of humor, 
Mr. Ginsberg?” 

“Certainly. Everybody does.” 

“Untrue,” Ware said. “Everybody 
claims to have, that’s all. I ask only 
because the first thing to be sacri- 
ficed to the Art is the gift of laughter, 
and some people would miss it more 
than others. Yours seems to be resi- 
dual at best; in you it would prob- 
ably be a minor operation, like an 
appendectomy.” 

“You don’t seem to have lost 
yours.” 

“You confuse humor with wit, like 
most people. The two are as different 
as creativity and * scholarship. How- 
ever, as I say, in your case it’s not 
a great consideration, obviously. 
But there may be greater ones: for 
example, what tradition I would be 
training you in. For instance, I 
could make a Kabbalistic magician 
of you, which would give you a sub- 
stantial grounding in white magic; 
and for the black, I could teach you 
most of what’s in the Clavicle and 
the Legemeton, cutting out the spe- 
cifically Christian accretions. Would 
that content you, do you think?” 

“Maybe, if it met my primary 
requirements,” Jack said. “But if I 
had to go on from there, I wouldn’t 
care. These days I’m a Jew only by 
birth, not by culture — and up im- 
til Christmas Eve I was an atheist 
Now I don’t know what I am; all 
I know is I’ve got to believe what 
I see.” 

“Not in this Art,” Ware said. “But

we’ll think of you as a tabula rasa 
for the time being. Well, Mr. Gins- 
berg, I’ll consider it. But beifore I 
decide, 1 think you ou^t to explore 
further your insight about special 
tastes becoming satisfiable dnly 
through magic, whether mine or 
yours. You like to think how delight- 
ful it would be to enjoy them fredy 
and without fear of consequences, 
but it often happens — you’ll re- 
member Oscar Wilde’s epigram on 
the subject — ithat fulfilled desire 
isn’t a delight, but a cross.” 

“I’ll take the chance.” 

“Don’t be so hasty. You have no 
real idea of the risks. Suppose you 
should find, for example, that no 
human woman could please you any 
more, and you’d become dependent 
on succubi? I don’t know how much 
you know of the theory of such a 
relationship. In general, the revolt 
in Heaven involved angels from 
every order in the hierarchy; and of 
the Fallen, only those who fell from 
the lowest rani^ are assigned to this 
sort of duty. By comparison, 
Marchosias is a paragon of nobility. 
These creatures have even lost their 
names, and there’s nothing in the 
least grand about their malignancy 
— they are pure essences of narrow 
meanness and petty spite, the kind 
of spirit a Sicilian xmlkmaid calls on 
to make her rival’s toenails split or 
give an unfaithful lover a pimple 
on the end of his nose.” 

“That doesn’t make them sound 
different from ordinary women,” 
Jack said, shrugging. “So long as 
they deliver, what does it matter? 
Presumably, as a magician I’d have 
some control over their behavior.” 



“Yes, Nevertheless, why be per- 
suaded out of desire and ignorance, 
when an experiment is available to 
you? In fact, Mr. Ginsberg, I would 
not trust any resolution you made 
from the state of simple fantasy 
you’re in now. If you won’t try the 
experiment, I must refuse your peti- 
tion.” 

“Now wait a minute,” Jack said. 
“Why are you so urgent about this, 
anyhow? What kind of advantage do 
you get out of it?” 

“I’ve already told you that,” Ware 
said patiently. “I will probably neeci 
you as a Tanist in Dr. Baines’s ma- 
jor enterprise. I want to be able tc 
trust you to stand fast, and I won’t 
be able to do that without being 
sure of your degree and kind of 
commitment.” 

Everything that Ware said seemed 
to have behind it the sound of doors 
softly closing in Jack’s face. And on 
the other hand, the possibilities — 
the opportunities — 

“What,” he said. “Must I do?”

T he palazzo was asleep. In the 
distance, that same oblivious 
clock struck eleven; the proper hour 
of this day. Ware had said, for ex- 
periments in venery. Jack waited 
nervously for it to stop, or for some- 
thing to betgin. 

His preparations were all made, 
but he was uncertain whether any 
of them had been necessary. After 
all, if the ... girl .. who was to 
come to him was to be totally amen- 
able to his wishes, why should he 
have to impress her?

Nevertlieless, he had gone ithrough 
all the special ntuails, bathing for an 
hour, shaving twice, trimming his 
finger and toenails and boffing ^em, 
brushing his hair back for thirty 
strokes and combing it with the 
West German tonic which was said 
to have allatoin in it, dressing in bis 
best silk pajamas, smoking jacket 
(though he neither smoked nor 
drank), ascot and Venetian leather 
snippers, adding a dash of cologne, 
and scattering a light film of talcum 
powder inside the bed. Maybe, he 
thought, part of the pleasure would 
be in taking all the trouble and 
having everything work. 

The dock stepped striking. Al- 
most at once, fiiere was a slow triple 
knodr at the door, so slow that e^ 
soft blow seemed like an indepen- 
dent act. Jack's heart bounded like 
a boy's. Putting t^e sash of his jack- 
et tighiter, he said as instructed: 

“Come in . Come in . • • Come 
in.” 

He opened the door. As Ware had 
told him to expect, there was no one 
m the dark corridor outside; but 
whein he dosed in the door and turn- 
ed around, there she was. 

“Good evening,” she said in a 
light vdee with the barest trace of 
an accent — or was it a lisp? “I am 
here, as you invited me. Do you 
like me?” 

It was not the same girl who had 
brought the letter to Ware, so many 
weeks ago, though she somehow re- 
minded him of someone he had once 
known, he could not think who. This 
one was positively beautiful. She was 
small — half a head shorter than 
Jack, slender and apparently only 



about eighteen — and very fair, 
with blue eyes and a fresh, innocent 
expression which was doubly piqu- 
ant because the lines of her features 
were patridan, her skin so delicate 
that it was almost like fine parch- 
ment. 

She was fully clothed, in spike 
heels, patterned but otherwise sheer 
stod^gs, and a short-sleeved, ex- 
pensively tailored black dress of 
some material like rayon which 
clung to her breasts, waist and upper 
hips as though electrified, and then 
burst into a Ml skirt like an inverted 
tulip which broke just above her 
knees. Wire-thin silv^ bracelets slid 
and tinMed almost inaudibly on her 
left wrist as die ruffled her chrys- 
anthemum-petal coiffure, and sniall 
silver earrings echoed them; be- 
tween her breasts was a dicular onyx 
brooch inlaid in silver with the word 
Cazotte, set off by a ruby about the 
size of a fly’s eye, the only touch 
of color in entire costume; even 
her make-up was the Itailian “white 
look,” long out of style but so exag- 
gerating her paleness as to look al- 
most theatrical on her — almost, but 
not quite. 

“Yes,” he said, remembering to 
breathe. 

“Ah, you make up your mind so 
soon. Perhaps you are wrong.” She 
pirou^ed away from him toward 
^e bed, making the black tulip flare 
and lace foam under its corolla 
around her legs with a dry rustling. 
She stopped the spin f adng him, so 
suddenly that the skirts snapped 
above her knees like banners in a 
stiff gust. She seemed wholly hu- 
man.

“Impossible,” Jack said, muster- 
ing all his gallantry. “I think you’re 
exquisite. Uh, what shall I call you?” 
“Oh, I do not come when called. 
You will have to exert yourself more 
than that. But my name could be 
Rita, if you need one.” 

She lifted the front of the skirts 
up over the welts of her stockings, 
which cut her white thighs only a 
few inches beneath the vase of her 
pelvis, and sat down daintily on the 
side of the bed. “You are very dis- 
tant,” she said, pouting. “Perhaps 
you suspect I am only pretty on the 
outside. That would be unfair.” 
“Oh no. I’m sure — ” 

“But how can you be sure yet?” 
She drew up her heels. “You must 
come and see.” 

T he clock was striking four when 
she arose, somehow looking las 
though she were still on high heels, 
and began to dip up her clothes from 
the floor. Jack watched this little 
ballet in a dizziness half exhaustion 
and half triumph. He had hardly 
enough strength left to wiggle a toe, 
but he had already surprised himself 
so often that he still had hopes. 
Nothing had ever been like this be- 
fore, nothing. 

“Must you go?” he said sluggishly. 
“Oh, yes, I have other business 
yet.” 

“Other business? But — didn’t you 
have a good time?” 

“A — good time?” The girl turned 
to\^d him, stopping in the act of 
fastening a garter strap. “I am thy 
servant and thy lamia, Eve-fruit, but 
thou must not mock me.” 

“I don’t understand,” Jack said. 



struggling to lift his head from the 
bunched, sweaty pillow. 

“Then keep silent.” She resumed 
assembling herself. 

“But — you seemed — ” 

She turned to him again. “I gave 
thee pleasure. Congratulate thyself; 
that is enough. Thou knowest well 
what I am. I take no pleasure in any- 
thing; it is not permitted. Be grat^ 
ful, and I shall come to thee again; 
but mock me, and I shall send thee 
instead a hag with an ass’s tail.” 

“I meant no offense,” he said, half 
sullenly. 

“See thou dost not. Thou hadst 
pleasure with me, that sufficeth; thou 
must prove thy virililty with naortal 
flesh. Thy potency, that I go to try 
even now; it comes on to night i’ 
the other side of the world, and I 
must plant thy seed before it dies 
in my fires — if ever it lived at aH.” 
“VVTiat do you mean?” he said, in 
a hoarse whisper. 

“Have no fear, I shall be back to- 
morrow. But in the next span of the 
dark I must change suit” The dress 
fell down over the impossibly pliant 
body. “I become an incubus now, 
and a woman waits for that, diverted 
from her husband by the two-fold 
way. Reach I her in time, thou shalt 
father a child on a woman thou 
shalt never even see. Is that not a 
wonder? And a fearful child it shall 
be, I promise thee!” 

She smiled at him. Behind her lids 
now, he saw with nausea and shame, 
there were no longer any eyes — 
only blankly flickering lights, Hke 
rising sparks in a flue. She was now 
as fully dressed as she had been at 
the be^nndnig, courtseying gravely.

“Wait for me . • . unless, of 
course, thou dost not want me back 
tomorrow night . .?” 

He tried not to answer, but the 
woids came out like clots of poison- 
ous gas. 

“Yes .... Oh, God . .” 
Cupping both hands over her hid- 
den groin in a gesture of obscene 
conservatism, she popped into 
nothingness like a bursting balloon, 
and the whole wei^ of the dawn 
fell upon Jack like the moimtains of 
St. John the Divine.

D r. Stockhausen died on St. 

Valentine’s day, after three 
days’ fruitless attemi^ by surgeons 
from all over the world, even the 
USSR, to save him from the ef- 
fects of a drau^ of a hundred mi- 
nims of tincture of iodine. The 
surgery and ho^ntal care were all 
free; but he di^ intestate, and it 
appeared that his small estate — a 
few royalties from his books and the 
remains of a ten-year-old Nobel 
Prize — would be tied up indefinite- 
ly. Especially in view of the note he 
lefi behind, out of which no tribunal, 
whether scientific or judicial, could 
hope to separate the mathematics 
from the ravings for generations to 
come. 

Funds were gathered for his grand- 
children and divorced daughter to 
tide them over; but the last book 
that he had been writing turned out 
to be so much like the note that his 
publishers’ referees could think of no 
colleague to whom it could reason- 
ably be offered for posthumous col- 



laboration. It was said that his brain 
would be donated to the museum of 
the Deutsches Akademie in MunLcfa 
— again only if his affairs could 
ever be probated. Within three days 
after the funeral, however. Ware was 
able to report, both brain and manu- 
script had vanished. 

“Marchosias may have taken one 
or both of them,” Ware said. “I 
didn’t tell him to, since I didn’t want 
to cause any more suffering to Al- 
bert’s relatives than was inevitable 
under the terms of the con^ssion. 
On (the other hand, I didn’t tell him 
not to, either. But the commission 
itself has been executed.” 

“Very good,” Baines said. He was, 
in fact, elated Of the other three 
people in the office with Ware — 
for Wiare had said there was no way 
to prevent Fr. Domenico from at- 
tending — none looked as pleased 
as Baines felt, but after all he was 
the only man who coimted here, the 
only one to whose emotions Ware 
need pay any more than marginal 
attention. “And much faster than 
you had anticipated, too. I’m very 
well satisfied. And also I’m now 
quite ready to discuss my major 
commission with you. Dr. Ware, if 
the planets and so on don’t make 
this a poor time to talk about it.” 

“The planetary influences exert 
almost no effect upon simple dis- 
cussion,” Ware said, “only on spe- 
cific preparations — and of course 
on the experiment itself. And I’m 
quite rested and ready to listen. In 
fact, I’m in an acute state of curiosi- 
ty. Please charge right in and teil 
me about it.” 

“I would like to let all the major

demons out of Hell for one 
turn them loose in the world with 
no orders and no restrictions — ex- 
cept of course that they go back by 
dawn or some other sensible time — 
and see just what it is they would 
do if they were left on their own 
hooks like that.” 

44Tnsanity!” Fr. Domenico cried 

X out, crossing himself. “Now 
surely the man is possessed alreadyl” 

“For once, I’m inclined to agree 
with you. Father,” Ware said, 
‘%ough with some reservations 
about the possession question. For all 
we can know now, it’s entirely in 
character. Tell me this, Dr. Baines: 
what do you hope to accomplish 
through an experiment on so colossal 
a scale?” 

“Experiment!” Fr. Domenico said, 
his face as white as the dead. 

“If you can do no more than 
echo. Father, I think we’d all prefer 
that you kept silent — at least until 
we find out what it is we’re talking 
about.” 

“I will say what I need to say, 
when I think it is needful,” Fr. 
Domenico said angrily. “This thing 
that you’re minimizing by calling it 
an ‘experiment’ might well end in 
the dawn of Armageddon!” 

“Then you should welcome it, not 
fear it, since you’re convinced your 
side must win,” Ware said. “But ac- 
tually there’s no such risk. The re- 
sults may well be rather apocalyp- 
tic, but Armageddon requires the 
prior appearance of the Antichrist, 
and I assure you I am not he . 
nor do I see anybody else in the 
world who might qualify. Now, 



again, Dr. Baines, what do you hope 
to acoom^lish through this?” 

“Notibii^ through It,” Baines, now 
totally caught up in the vision, said 
dreamily. “Only the thing its^ — 
for its esthetic interest alone. A work 
of art, if you like. A giganitic action 
painting, with the world for a can- 
vas — ” 

“ — and human blood for pig- 
ments,” Fr. Domenico ground out. 

Ware held up his hand, palm 
toward the monk. “1 had thought,” 
he said to Baines, “that this was the 
art you practiced already, and in 
effect sold the resulting canvasses, 
too.” 

“The sales kept me able to con- 
tinue practicing it,” Baines said, but 
he was beginning to find the meta- 
phor awkward, his though it had 
originally been. “Look at it this way 
for a moment. Dr. Ware. Very 
roughly, there are only two gener^ 
kinds of men who go into the muni- 
tions business: those without con- 
sciences, who see the business as an 
avenue to a great fortune, eventual- 
ly to be used for something else, 
like Jack here — and of course 
there’s a sub-class of those, people 
who do have consciences but can’t 
resist the money anyhow, or the 
knowledge, rather like Dr. Hess.” 

Both men stirred, but apparently 
both decided not to dispute their 
portraits. 

“The second kind is made up of 
people like me: people who actually 
take pleasure in the controlled pro- 
duction of chaos and destruction. 
Not sadists primarily, except in the 
sense that every dedicated artist is 
something of a sadist, willing to

countenaince a little or a lot of suf- 
fering — not only bis own, bot other 
people’s — for the sake of the end- 
prodnct.” 

familiar type, to be sure,*’ 
Ware said with a lop-sided grin. *1 
think it was the saintly Robert Frost, 
who said that a painting by Whistler 
wias worth any number of old 
ladies.” 

“Engineers are like this too,” 
Baines said, warming rapidly to ii^ 
demonstration; he had b^ thinking 
aiboult almost nothing else since the 
conjuration he had attended. ’There’s 
a breed I know mudi better than 1 
do artists, and 1 can tell you that 
most of them wouldn’t build a thing 
if it weren’t for the kidc they get 
out of the preiliminiaiy demolitions 
involved. A common thief with a 
gun in his hand isn’t half as dan- 
gerous as an engineer with a stick 
of dynamite. 

“BiKt in my case, just as in the 
case of the engineer, the key word 
is ‘controlled’ — and in the muni- 
tions business, it’s rapidly becoming 
an obsolete word, thanks to nuclear 
weapons.” 

He went on quickly to sketdi his 
dissatisfactions, very much as they 
had first come to a head in Rome 
while Gov. Rogan had been being 
sent for. “So now you can see what 
appeals to me about the commission 
I propose. It won’t be a series of 
mass obliterations under nobody’s 
control, but a whole set of indivi- 
duals actions, each in itself on a com- 
paratively small scale — and each 
one, I’m sure, interesting in itself 
because of all the different varieties 
of ingenuity and surprise to be in- 



volved. And it won’t be total because 
it will also be self-liaiiting to some 
small period of time, presumably 
twelve horns or less.” 

Fr. Domenico leaned forward 
earnestly. “Surely,” he said to Ware, 
“even you can see that no human 
being, no matter how sinful and 
self-fulgent, could have elalboraited 
anything so monstrous without the 
dii^ intervention of Helll” 

44/^n the contrary,” Wore said, 
V-^“Dr. Baines is quite right, 
most dedicated secularists think ex- 
actly as he does — only on a some- 
what smaller scale. For your further 
comfort. Father, 1 am somewhat 
privy to the affairs of HeU, and I 
investigate all my major clients 
thoroughly. 1 can tell you that Dr. 
Baines h not possessed. But all the 
same there ere still a few mysteries 
here. Dr. Baines, I still think you 
may be resorting to too big a brush 
for the intended canvas end might 
get the effects you want entirely 
without my help. For example, why 
won’t the forthcoming Sino-Russian 
War be enou^ for you?” 

“So that’s really going to happen?” 
“It’s written down to happen; it 
still might not, but I wouldn’t bet 
against it. Very likely it won’t be a 
major nuclear war; three fusion 
bombs, one Chinese, two Soviet, plus 
about twenty fission explosions, and 
then about a year of conventional 
land war. No other powers are at 
ail likely to become involved. You 
know this. Dr. Baines, and I should 
think it would please you; after all, 
it’s almost exactly the way your firm 
has been trying to pre-set it.” 



136 



IF 




“You’re full of coinsolaitions to- 
day,” Fr. Ekmenico muttered. 

“Well, in fact, 1 am damn pleased 
to (hear it,” Baines said. asn*t 
often itihat you plan sometihin^ that 
big and have it come off almost as 
planned. But no. Dr. Ware, it won’t 
be enough for me, because it’s still 
too general and difficult to follow 

— or will be; I’m having a little 
trouble with my tenses. For one 
thing, it won’t be sufficiently attri- 
butable to me. Many people have 
been working to bring that war 
about. This experiment will be on 
my initiaitive alone.” 

“Not an insuperable objection,” 
Ware said. “A good many Renais- 
sance artists didn’t object to collabo- 
rators — even journeymen.” 

“Well, the spirit of the times has 
changed, if you want an abstract 
answer. The real answer is that I do 
object. Furthermore, Dr. Ware, 1 
want to choose my own medium. 
War doesn’t satisfy me any more. 
It’s too sloppy, too subject to acci- 
dent. It excuses too much.” 

“?” Ware said with an eyebrow. 

“I mean that in time of war, es- 
pecially in Asia, people expect the 
worst and try to ride with the punch- 
es, no matter how terrible they are. 
In peacetime, on the other hand, 
even a small misfortune comes as a 
total surprise. People complain, 
‘Why did ^is have to happen to me?^ 

— as though they’d never heard of 
Job.” 

“Re-writing Job is the humanist’s 
favorite pastime,” Ware agreed. 
“And his favorite poMcal platform, 
(too. So in fact, Dr. Baines, you do 
want to afflict people, just where 



theyVe most sensitive to beong a£- 
£lioted> and just when they lea^ ex- 
pect fi right or wrong. Do 1 under- 
stand you correctly?” 

Baines had the shddnig feeling 
that he had explained too much, but 
there was no help for that now; and 
in any event. Ware was hardly him- 
self a saint. 

“You do,” he said diortly. 
“Thank you. That clears the air 
enormously. One more question: 
How do you propose to pay for all 
this?” 

Fr. Domenico surged to his feet 
with a strangled gasp of horror, like 
the death-throes of an asthmatic. 
“You — you mean to do this!” 
“Hush. I haven’t said so. Dr. 
Baines, the question?” 

“I know I couldn’t pay for it in 
cash,” Baines said. “But I’ve got 
other assets. This experiment — 
if k works — is going to satisfy 
something for me thalt Consohdaited 
Warfare Service hasn’t siatisified in 
years and probably never will again 
except marguially. I’m willing to 
make over most of my CWS stock 
to you. Not all of it, but — well — 
just short of being a controlling in- 
terest. You ought to be able to do a 
lot with that.” 

“It’s hardly enough, considering 
the risks involved,” Ware said slow- 
ly. “On the other hand, I’ve no par- 
ticular desire to bankrupt you — ” 
“Doctor Wiare,” Fr. Domendca 
said in an iron voice. “Am I to con- 
clude that you are going to under- 
take this fearful insanity?” 

“I haven’t said so,” Ware replied 
mildly. “If I do, I shall certaiiily 
need your hdp — ”

learn from a trial like this.” 

4CT think that’s right,” Hess’ voice 
X said. Baines looked toward 
him in surprise, but Hess seemed 
quite serious. ‘Td be greatly inter- 
ested in it myself.” 

“You’ll learn nothing,” Fr. Do- 
menico said, “but ^ the shortest of 
all short-cuts to Hell, probably in 
the bodyl” 

“A negative Assumption?” Ware 
said, raising both eydbrom this time. 
“But now you’re tempting my pride, 
Father. There’ve been only two pre- 
vious ones in Western history: 
Johannes Faustus and Don Juan 
Tenorio. And neither one was 
properly safeguarded or otherwise 
prepar^. Well, now certainly I must 
underltake so great a work — pro- 
vided that Dr. Baines is satisfied that 
he’ll get what he’ll be paying for.” 
“Of course I’m satisfied,” Baines 
said, quivering with joy. 

“Not so fast. You’ve asked me to 
let all the major demons out of Hell. 
I can’t even begin to do that; I can 
call up only those with whom I have 
pacts and their subordinates. No 
matter what you have read in Ro- 
mantic novels and plays, the three 
superior spirits cannot be invoked at 
all. and never sign pacts: those be- 



ing Sathanas, Beelzebuth and 
Satanachia. Under eadi of these are 
two ministers, with one of the six 
of which it is possible to make pacts 
— one per magician, that is. I con- 
trol Lucifuge Rofocale, and he me. 
Under him in turn, I have pacts 
widi some edgihty-nine other spirits, 
not all of wMch would be of any 
use to us here — Vassago, for in- 
stance, who has a mild nature and 
no powers except in oiystallomaiicy, 
of Phoenix, a poet and teacher. 
With the utmost in careful prepara- 
tions, we might involve as many as 
fifty of the rest, certainly no more. 
FranMy, I think that will prove to be 
more than enou^” 

“I’ll cheerfully take your word for 
it,” Baines said promptly. “You’re 
the expert. Will you take it on?” 

“Yes.” 

Fr. Domenico, who was still stand- 
ing, swung away toward the door, 
but Ware’s hand riiot out toward him 
above the desk as if to grasp the 
monk by the nape of the neck. 
“Hold!” the mag^cian said. “Your 
commission is not discharged. 
Father Domenico, as you know very 
well in your heart You must observe 
this sending. Even more important, 
you have already said yourself that 
it is going to be difficult to keep un- 
der control. To that end I demand

tion; your presence in the conjura- 
tions, and, should they be ne^ed, 
your utmost offices in helping me 
and my other Tanists to abort it. This 
you cannot refuse — it is all in your 
mission by stipulation, and in the 
Covenant by implication. I do not 
force you to it. I do but remind

you of your positive duty to your 
Lord.” 

“That . is « . trae ...” Fr. 
Domenico said in a side whisper. 
His ifiaoe as gray as an unltinited new 
blotter, he gro]^ for the chair and 
sat down again. 

“Nobly faced. I’ll have to instruct 
everyone here, but I’ll start with you, 
in deference to your distress — ” 

“One question,*’ Fr. Domenico 
said. “Once you’ve instructed us all, 
you’ll be out of toudi with us for 
perhaps as much as a month to come. 
I demand the time to visit my col- 
leagues, and perhaps call together 
a convocation of all white magid- 
ians — ” 

‘To prevent me?’’ Ware said be- 
tween his teeth. “You can demand 
no sudi thing. The Covenant forbids 
the slightest interference.” 

“I’m tall too horribly aware of 
that No, not to interfere, but to 
stand by, in case of disaster. It 
would be too late to call for them 
once you knew you were losing con-

“Hmm .... Probably a wise pre- 
caution, and one I couldn’t justly 
prevent. Very well; just be sure 
you’re back when the time comes. 
About the day, what wuld you sug-

and we may well need that much 
time in preparation. 

“It’s too good a (time for any sort 
of control,” Fr. Domenico said 
grimly. “I definitely do not recom- 
mend piling a real Walpuigisnight on 
top of the formal one. It would be 
wiser to choose an unfavorable 
ni^t, the more unfavorable the bet- 
ter.” 



“Excellent good sense,” Ware saidi 
“Very well, then. Inform your 
friends. The experiment is hereby 
scheduled for Easter.” 

With a scream, Fr. Domenico 
bolted from the room. Had Baines 
not been taught all his life long that 
such a thing was impossible in a 
man of God, Baines would have 
identified it without a second thought 
as a scream of hatred.

T heron Ware had been dreaming 
a joum^ to the Antarctic con- 
tinent in the midst of its Jurassic 
splendor, Efty million years ago, but 
the dream had been becoming a little 
muddled with personal fantasies — 
mostly involving a minor enemy he 
had in reality had sent for, with 
flourishes, a good decade ago — 
and he was not sorry when it van- 
ished unfinished at dawn. 

He awoke sweating, thou^ the 
dream had not been espedaly stress- 
ful. The reason was not far to seek 
Ahktoi was sleeping, a puddle of lard 
and fur,' on i^e pillow and bad 
nearly crowded Ware’s head off it. 
Ware sat up, mopping his pate with 
the top she^ and stared at the cat 
with nearly neutral annoyance. Even 
for an Abyssinian, a big-bound breed, 
the familiar was grossly over-weiight; 
clearly an exclusive diet of human 
fle^ was not a heialthy regimen for 
a cat. Furthermore, Ware was not 
even sure it was necessary. It was 
prescribed only in Eliphas Levi, who 
often made up such details as he 
went along. Certainly Phoenix, 
whose creature Ahktoi was, had 



FAUST ALEPH-NULL 



139 




made no such stipulatioin. On tihe 
other hand, it Wias aOiwiays best to 
play safe in such matters; and be- 
sod^, financially the diet was not 
much more than a nuisance. The 
worst that could be said for it was 
that iit spoiled the cat’s lines. 

Ware arose, naked, and crossed 
the cold room to the lectern which 
bore up his Great Book — not the 
book of pacts, which was of course 
sitill safely m the workroom, but his 
book of new knowledge. It was open 
to the section headed 

QUASARS 

but except for the brief paragraph 
summarizing the reliable scientific 
information on the subject — a veiry 
brief paragraph indeed — the pages 
were still blank. 

Well, that, like so much else, could 
wait imtil Baines’s project was exe- 
cuted. Truly colossal advances might 
be made in the Great Book, once 
all that CWS money was in the bank. 

Ware’s retirement had left the 
members of Baines’s party again at 
loose ends, and all of them, even 
Baines, were probably a little shaken 
at the magnitude of what they had 
contracted for. In Baines and Dr. 
Hess, perhaps, there still remained 
some faint traces of doubt about its 
possibility, or at least some inability 
to imagine what it would be like, 
despite the previous apparition of 
Marchosias. No such impediment 
could protect Jack Ginsberg, how- 
ever — not now, when he awakened 
each morning with the very taste 
of Hell in his mouth. Ginsberg was 
committed, but he was not wearing 



well; he would have to be watched. 
The waiitiQig peiiiod would be espe- 
cially haird on him. WeU, that 
couldn’t be helped; it was prescribed. 

The cat uncurled yawned, stretch- 
ed, lurched daintily to its feet and 
paused at the edge of the bed, peer- 
ing down the sideboard as though 
contemplating the inward slope of 
Fujiyama. At last it hit the floor 
with a double splat! like the impacts 
of two loaded sponges. There it 
arched its spine again, stretched out 
its back legs individually in an 
ecstasy of quivering and walked 
slowly toward Ware, its furry ab- 
domen swinging from side to side. 
Hein? it said in a breathy feminine 
voice. 

“In a minute,” Ware said, preoc- 
cupied. “You’ll get fed when I do.” 
He had forgotten for the moment 
that he had just begun a nine days’ 
fast, which when completed he would 
enforce also upon Baines and his 
henchmen. “Father Eternal, O thou 
who are seated upon cherubim and 
seraphim, who beholdest the earth 
and the sea, unto thee do I Hf t up 
my hands, and beseech thine aid 
alone, thou who art the fulflUment 
of works, who givest booty imto 
those who toil, who exaltest the 
proud, who art destroyer of all life 
and author of death; rest art thou, 
protector of those who call upon 
thee; do thou guard and defend 
me in this undertaking, thou who 
livest and reignest forever and ever. 
Amen! Shut up, Ahktoi.” 

Anyhow it had been years isince 
he had believed for an instant that 
Ahktoi was really hungry. Maybe 
lean meat was What the cat needed. 



140 



IF 




instead of all that baby-fait — 
though stillbirths were certainly the 
easiest kind of rations to get for him. 

R inging for Gretchen, Ware went 
into the bathroom, where he 
ran a bath, into which he dashed 
an ounce of exorcised water left over 
from the dressing of a parchment. 
Ahktoi, who like most Abyssinians 
loved running water, leapt up on the 
rim of the tub and tried to fish for 
bubbles. Pushing the cat off, Ware 
sat down in the warm pool and spoke 
the Thirteenth Psalm, Dominus iU 
luminatio meat of death and resur- 
rection, his voice resounding hollow- 
ly from the tiles; adding, “Lord who 
hast formed man out of nothing to 
thine own image and likeness, and 
me also, imworthy sinner as I am, 
deign, I pray thee, to bless and

mi^ty and ineffable, who didst lead 
forth thy people front the land of 
Egypt, and didst cause them to pass

me an thou wilt, father of sins.

He slid under the water, crown to 
toes — but not for long, for the 
ounce of exorcised water he had \ 
added still had a trace of quicklime 
in it from the tanning of the lamb- 
skin, which made his eyes sting. He 
surfaced, blowing like a whale, and 
added quickly to the steamy air,

INVADER 

by HARL VINCENT 

Illustrated by BODS 



Someone was sharing my 
body — and doing better 
with if than I ever did! 



I 

E ver wake up in the middle of 
the night with the eerie convic- 
tion that someone was there in the 
darkness of your room? I guess al- 
most everybody has. 

But this night it was different with 
me. Not someone, but something 
was there; and it was in my bed — 
real, a thing that glided up from the 
sheet and skimmed across my chest 
— not touching the skin ^ough, 
seemingly — up, up toward my face. 



I grabbed for it, but found nothing. 
Then, as I rolled over to snap on 
the light, it settled on the back of 
my neck; and there 1 did get the feel 
of the t^g for an instant Or did 
1? It seemed like a half clam shell 
with the flat open side against me, 
and as I tried to explore it with my 
fingers it literally melted or dis- 
solved. Better to say that it absorbed 
swiftly into my body at that point 
without my feeling anything what- 
ever of its entrance. 

There was somehow the impres- 



143 





sion that, if this bad been a clam 
shell, a small one like a Oherry- 
stone, the creature itsdf in the 
half and was alive. Thou^ there was 
no feeling of wetness, in fact no sen- 
sation at all. Only an impression. 
The light flicked on at my finger’s 
touch, and 1 sat up jerkily, blinking 
to assure myself that 1 wasn’t dream- 
ing. A voice within told me sooth- 
ingly and convincingly to go back to 
sleep. Which I must have done at 
once. 

T welve light-years distant in the 
city of Xenor on Tau Ceti II, 
planet of the roso4inted mists, a 
huge crowd was assembled in the 
palace square. The hush of fearful 
anticipation held them as their faces 
all raised up toward a balcony of 
the palace. No humanoids, these; 
they were magnificently built hu- 
mans, differing from us mainly in 
the golden hue of their irises and 
their simple, glistening, skintight 
garb. 

Among those near the walls 
were twenty or more of the Small 
Folk, likewise human in appearance 
on a miniature scale, but with heads 
slightly oversized for thedr 24-inch, 
nearly naked, chubby bodies. They 
had no wings, but levitated and 
flitted about almost continuously. 
Their mission seemed to be to ahay 
the obvious fears of the multitude 
since, even though they spoke or 
sang no words, their cheering 
thoughts were spread throughout the 
square without discrimination. The 
burden of these was: “Our princess 
will, recover. We know. We know. 
Believe us!” 



Beyond the wall could be seen 
the multicolored, pyramidal build- 
ings of a great city: windowless 
structures with aircars darting busily 
hither and yon amongst them, often 
landing on a stage atop one of the 
tall edifices. Far beyond the city, of 
course, towered mighty Mount Leo 
with its upper halo of rose-hued 
mist on which the late sun gleamed 
redly and hotly. 

Inside the palace, in a large room 
from which the balcony opened, an 
agitated young man in princely garb 
faced the Mindmaster, who was 
robed like a monk. On a couch be- 
fore them lay the draped form of a 
girl of charming proportions, her 
face nearly hidden in a tumbled 
mass of glorious golden hair. She 
was obviously in deep coma. 

“What’s the verdict, Nelot?” the 
young man demanded. 

“Prince Bor, our tests show that 
in the hysteria of her original seizure 
the cortex fled her brain and has 
since taken up residence in a maid 
of Erd.” 

“Eard, third planet of the white 
sun Saltan? So far?” 

“Just so,” the Mindmaster said 
gravely. 

“What’s being done? Aria must 
be saved; think of our subjects out 
there. Think even of me!” The young 
man sounded panicky. 

“We’ll do everything possible — 
with your cooperation. I’ve means 
for teleporting your cortex to Erd, 
there to reside in ,a selected male 
whom we can assist and direct, hope- 
fully unknown to him, to provide 
protection for her — mainly against 
herself.” 





“Meaning her suiddal impulses girl’s. It was Bor, head uncovered

golf ball. The Mindmaster, his brow 
corrugated, gestured; and the ball 
sped off into infuiite distance, 
shrinking as it raced until it was a 
minute but brilliant speck of iight, 
then vanisihing like the light spot 
from a TV tube. 

As the mist cleared to reveal the 
two recumbent figures again, it was 
evident that they were in similar 
comas. Bor’s fine features had con- 
gealed into a solid mask, and there 
was no indication whatever that he 
even breathed. 

Nelot composed the draping of 
both figures, then stepped to the bal- 
cony and reassured the crowd in the 
plaza as best he could. His talk was 
continuing as all faded from sight 
and sound. 

II 

I n the office next morning, my 
partner Grant Cory looked at me 
searchingly as he came in. Our sec- 
retary hadn’t arrived yet, and I was 
opening the morning maiL It was 
early. 

“What’s been happening to you?” 
Grant asked. “You look like a new 
guy.” 

“Hah! I sure don’t feel like it,” I 
told him. “I had a perfectly rotten 
night.” 

“Couldn’t sleep?” 

“Worse. Crazy dreams.” 

A slip of paper slid from the en- 
velope I’d just sli'tted, a check. 

“Hey! Look at this!” I waved it 
before my partnM-. “It was for 
$17,000.00. “And listen to this . .” 
I read from the accompanying 
letter, which was from a client we’d 



worked extremely hard to please. 

“It ends up,” I said and quoted: 
*An extra two thousand over and 
above your fee is included as a bo- 
nus for the excellent report your 
partnership rendered. You will hear 
from us the first of next month with 
regard to , another report we want you 
to make.’ ” 

“How about that?” Grant was on 
his feet doing a sort of little tap 
dance. “This seems to be our lucl^ 
day.” 

Miss Bailey came in then and took 
over the rest of the mail, her eyes 
widening behind the thick glasses 
when she saw the check. Later a 
second check for CORY AND 
RADFORD turned up, and this was 
in the thousands too, though less 
than half the previous one. At any 
rate, we were flushed with success 
— it isn’t every day that a youthful 
partnership of consulting engineers 
sees so much in the way of fees. 

“Time for vacation,” Grant de- 
clared. “What say. Chuck? I’ve 
been wanting to take the family to 
Acapulco for a long time — wife 
has a cousin there. So what say 
we split the bonus and go places?” 

“Okay,” said I, “and I think I’U 
go to Vegas, not having a family. 
You may take two weeks with pay 
when we return. Miss Bailey.” 

The girl grinned her thanks. 

“Vegas!” exclaimed Cory. “You 
don’t gamble.” 

I’d been asking myself already 
what prompted me to decide on Las 
Vegas, for the reason he mentioned. 
Though to drive the route was an 
appealing prospect. 

“Oh, it can be exciting or restful 




there, as you choose. I like to see a 
girlie show now and then; and, be- 
sides, Jack Carter’s at the Flamingo, 
and I get a big bang out of him.” 
A sinall accusing voice within told 
me these weren’t the real reasons, 
but I couldn’t think of any other 
at the moment. 

“Everyone to his own taste,” 
Grant said. “So let’s go.” 

“I’ll give you a ring every second 
day. Miss Bailey,” I told her, “to 
see what’s going on. Watch things, 
huh?” 

We were gone then, leaving our 
desks perfectly clear. 

I hadn’t even known there was a 
Star Vega Hotel in Vegas, but I 
flew up there from LA on one of 
their planes instead of driving. A 
thing I never would have done or- 
dinarily. So I guessed Cory had been 
right; I did seem to be a new guy. 

And the Star Vega was quite a 
splash, a 35-story, aluminum-and- 
glass deal that dwaiied all the others 
on the strip. With a regular park 
all around it and a lagoon witih 
swans. Posh! Luxury itself. 

The lobby was like most of the 
others only more so, opening into 
the casino on the right side and with 
elevators and the registration desk 
on the left. I filled out the card, 
and a snooty bellhop took my grips 
and led me to room 2929, where he 
held out his hand for the fiver I was 
sap enough to slip him. Didn’t even 
thank me, so I guess I wasn’t so 
bi^earted at that. After all, he had 
opened the transom. 

I looked out the window down 
the strip, where tthe neons were al- 



ready starting to flare. Quite a sightl 
1 was sudd^y and unaccountably 
seized with a desire to try my luck 
in the casino. Imaginel 
Next thing 1 was in line at one 
of the cashier’s booths and buying 
five bucks worth of quarters. Ihen 
I strolled along a row of two-bit, one- 
arm bandits and played one of the 
quarters in each, hitting the jackpot 
in one after another of them. Both 
my jacket pockets were filled, and 
quarters were splashing all over the 
floor, jangling and rolling every 
which way. I bad quite a following 
all of a sudden and this included a 
page boy (they hate being called 
bellhops in this place) with a canvas 
sack two feet deep and some sage 
advice that he whispered while ool- 
lectkug the next jackpot in his bag. 

“If I was you, mister,” he mutter- 
ed, “I’d lay off the slot machines a 
while. Else they’ll think you’re just 
too damn lucky.” 

“Who’re ‘they?’ ” I whispered 
back as he gathered in another 
jackpot. 

“Just ‘they.’” 

I played the last four machines 
in the row — jackpots all — end 
his sack was loaded to the point 
where he could barely carry it 
“I’ll change these into tens and 
twenties for you,” he panted. 

“Okay and keep twenty for your- 
self,” knowing he’d steal more than 
that and caring not at all. 

I moved over to one of the crap 
games as he staggered off. 

Here I made side bets and won 
them all, whether 1 bet for or 
against the player. My pockets were 



IKVADER 



147 




fiUiimg with bills now. Some lOU’s 
too, which I itucked into a separate 
po<^et. 

Then the dice were in my hand, 
and I was rattling them for a roll. 
Never shot crap in my life, but I’d 
been watching and listening. Made 
what are called “passes” — twelve 
in a row. Not without a fuss though; 
at every diird pass as I let all or 
most of the money ride I got a dirty 
look and a fresh pair of dice. But I 
kept right on winning, mostly with 
naturals; but if I did roll a point — 
and there were only two of these, 
a ten and a four — I made it on 
the next toss. Bettors on the side were 
making a cleanup on me too when 
a small voice inside told me to draw 
way down, bet only ten bucks, that 
I was about to crap out. Which I did 
on the next roll. “Snake-eyes!” 
someone groaned. 

Counting my winnings, I had over 
sLsteen thousand dollars before I 
took the sheaf of bills the pageboy 
brought me. “Twenty-seven C’s 
here,” he whispered and was gone. 

I sauntered over to one of the 
blackjack tables and watched that 
game for a while; then when a play- 
er across from the dealer rost to 
leave the game, I started to edge 
into his seat. 

“Huh-uh,” husked the dealer, 
“you’re to hot. Try the Sands.” 

So the word had been passed: 
here’s a possible big winner. 

L ucky as I’d been — or whatever 
you want to call it — I’d de- 
veloped no gambling fever whatso- 
ever. There was only that small voice 
thiat egged me on, telling me I hadn’t 



won enough yet. Enough for what? 

At the Sands I started differently, 
picking out the few slot machines 
that took in silver dollars when there 
were plenty of those to be had and 
paid off in kind, but now used those 
cashable doUar-sized tokens with the 
casino’s name showing prominently 
among the imprints. 

1 still hit the jackpots, but changed 
my procedure by feeding back a 
couple of tokens from the loot, then 
cashing in immediately after eadi 
successive haul. This proved to be a 
smart move on account of the lesser 
attention it attracted, besides being 
easier on my pockets. I’d added quite 
a bundle of tens, twenties and even 
C-notes to my take by the time I 
found and cleaned up on the last 
dollar machine. 

Then to the wheel, and here I 
played a cautious game, although I 
won every bet I placed. But they 
weren’t spectacularly large bets; I 
spaced them and after each win I 
walked around for a while and came 
back later — four or five times, I 
guess. By the time the croupier was 
wising up to me I was ready to quit 
anyway and had what I thought to 
be a lot of loot froin this source. 
Though I learned later that I w^ 
little more than a piker compared 
with some of the legendary big win- 
ners. Which was good, I suppose. 

My next play was at the Riviera. 
I’d aimed at the Sahara, but the 
cabbie touted me off that and onto 
the Riviera — said it was going bad 
for the house there that night As 
if I hadn’t done well enough al- 
ready, by my standards. Of course 
I didn’t know just how much I’d

IP 




deposited with the managers when 
1 made that brief stop back at the 
Star Vega after the Sands play but 
guessed it might be twenty grand 
or more. 

Never used the word “grand” in 
that sense before either — so it 
must be some of the jargon of the 
strip was rubbing off on me. 

In the Riviera casino I made di- 
rectly for the first crap game in 
sight and there I made a few side 
bets, winni ng them all. I was tired 
of it by now and very glad to hear 
that small voice say, “It’s enough.” 
So that was that; I quit and was 
paid off to the tune of only eighteen 
C’s. But if that was enough, so be 
it. I was really weary. 

Ill 

B ack at the Star Vega, I sat down 
at one of those little tables that 
"dot the edges of the casino here and 
there, a table not too far from the 
desk and the elevators. A perky 
cocktail waitress, wearing much 
much less than the law allows, asked 
for my order. 

“A double Scotch,” I said, “on 
the rocks, with iced coffee on the 
side. 

The girl looked at me like I must 
be crazy or something. Maybe I was 
just then, but this was what I wanted 
and I didn’t bat an eye — if you 
can bat an eye either with or with- 
out a bat. 

“Yes sure,” she gurgled and flitted 
off with a display of about all the 
skin she had. 

The drink was a good one and 
only set me back five bucks plus a 



dollar tip. So what! The gal was 
cute, and I was in the swankiest 
place on the strip, besides having 
played — and beat — the casinos 
for most of an evening. I should feel 
good about it, I suppose, but some- 
how I didn’t. In fact, I felt a little 
depressed by it all. 

A t this point I suddenly seemed 
to be two people. Things be- 
came confused, and it sure wasn’t 
the Scotch. Not just one double. 

The casino, to me, faded into 
obscurity. Mists enclosed it all and 
then cleared, revealing the Mind- 
master and the two draped forms 
on Tau Ceti II. 

Nelot suddenly looked directly 
at me and plac^ a finger on his 
lips to enjoin silence. Then he drew 
back the covering from the face of 
the recumbent man. 

So help me, it was me! Same 
shock of brown hair, same high 
cheekbones and square jaw, same 
straight (I’d always thought almost, 
but not quite aristocratic) nose. On 
him it was aristrocratic. This was 
Bor, and Nelot redraped his face 
gravely as the body remained motion- 
less. 

Then the Mindmaster proceeded 
to Aria and uncovered her head, 
swept back the unbelievably golden 
hair, (not blonde, not yellow, but 
really golden) and revealed a calm, 
almost perfectly chiseled profile. 
Skin ivory, satiny smooth, fordhead 
higji» chin firm and cherry lips 
purs^ in the hint of a pout. There 
was a slight intimation of pertness in 
the almost imperceptibly retrousse’ 
nose.

“Just so you’ll know ...” Nelot 
was wSuspeimg. 

The nods^ swirled again, 
vanisiMd, and a local voice readied 
me from the registration desk. An 
unpleasant one. 1 saw that an ex- 
pensively dressed young girl was 
taking some guff from the clerk, and 
I burned. So help me again, hers was 
Aria’s profile! And the sHgtht pout 
of the lips was atrerdble — she was 
about to cry. 

I got there fast. “What goes on?” 
I demanded of the clerk. 

“It’s none of your business,” he 
said hau^itily. 

I leaned over and yanked his col- 
lar awry. “I’m making it my business, 
you lug!” I turned to the girl, who 
was white and shaky. 

“They locked me out of my 
room,” she quavered. 

“Why?” I yeUed at the clerk. 
“Non-payment of her bill,” quoth 
he, trying to straighten his collar and 
glaring at me, “besides the lOU’s.” 
“What lOU’s?” 

No answer. “I’m going to the 
manager!” I bawled, grabbing the 
now frightened girl and propelling 
her toward his door, which was 
marked in big letters, “PRIVATE.” 
“You can’t go in there,” the clerk 
squeaked. 

But I could and did, pushing the 
girl ahead of me. “Can’t you ask 
her to sit down?” I yammered at 
the portly manager. 

He looked daggers at me, then 
seeing I sure meant busine^: “You 
may sit down. Miss Jones,” he said 
grudgingly. 

Sht sat, twisting her handkerchief.

“What the hell is this about?” 1 
demanded of the fat one. 

“She owes us sixty doUais for 
three days room rent, and there are 
the lOU’s.” 

He consulted a ledger. “$22,090.- 

00 on the button. Plus our 60, of 
course.” 

“What?” I yelped. “What’re diey 
for — the lOU’s?” 

Gambling chits. At several casinos. 
They brought them here for collec- 
tion, and Miss Jones says she can’t 
pay. Besides, there’s no such p^- 
son; we checked the address she 
registered under. They — ” 

“Who’re ‘they?’” I asked him. 

Again — evasively: “Just ‘they.’” 

“Yeah? How much do I have on 
deposit with you?” I asked, shoving 
the last $1800.00 at him. “Including 
this?” 

He counted it and added the figure 
to a page of the ledger. He seemed 
surprised as he replied, “$22,900.00.” 

That’s how I felt — surprised. 
How come it so nearly balanced? 

“Pay her lOU’s — and yourself,” 

1 told him. 

The girl was frankly crying now, 
shaking her head vigorously at me 
to indicate a “no.” 

“Cut it out!” I told her. Then 
to the manager: “You get her room 
unlocked — pronto! — meaning, 
take out the plugs you put in the 
lock.” 

“Yes, sir” He reached for one of 
his phones. 

“Miss Jones — ” I began. 

“Call me Jan,” she said through 
the tears. 

“And I’m Chuck, Chuck Rad- 
ford. Let’s go!” 

W 




A t the desk I asked for my key — 
and hers. They were 2929 and 
2930 — adjoinmg roomsi Coinci- 
dence? Not by a damn sight. 

This gave me pause, and a s m a l l 
voice confirmed thait it had been 
planned that way. I was two people 
again — or something. 

The clerk grinned as he passed 
over the keys. 

“And wipe that idiotic smirk off 
your pussl” I gritted, “or I’ll bash 
your teeth down your throat.” 

He looked and acted like a 
wooden puppet after that. 

The elevators here were automa- 
tic, of course; and as the girl stepped 
through the open door it almost shut 
in my face before I was able to get 
in after her. I forced it back and 
was in. The little 29 square was al- 
ready lighted as the door closed and 
the car started up. 

It was then I saw the hoodlum 
in the comer, with a wicked looking 
snub-nosed automatic weaving to 
cover first the girl and then me. 

“This is a snatch!” he declared, 
“and you, dude, keep the hell out of 
it or you’ll get it first.” 

I’d get it anyway, I decided — 
if he could manage. He wasn’t going 
to leave any witness alive. So, glad 
that I’d kept up with my judo and 
karate practice, I chopped down on 
his wrist before he could move or 
pull the trigger. He screamed as the 
wrist snapped and the gun boomed, 
making a neat round hole in the 
floor. I chopped again, first intend- 
ing to get him directly beneath that 
crooked nose, a chop that might well 
have proved fatal. So I dropped my 
swing and hit his throat with the 



edge of my stiffened hand instead. 
His eyes popped, his face puirpled 
and he fell to the floor In lagony. 

For good measure, 1 kicked his 
temple. Hard. And he was out 
This was when Jan fainted. We 
were still rising: 18, 19, 20. I 
grabbed the emergency phone with 
the girl draped over my other arm 
and told the operator: “Send your 
house dick up to floor 29. He’ll find 
a gunsel — a would-be killer — in 
elevator six. Out cold. I’ll block the 
elevator at 29.” 

I carried Jan to 2930 and de- 
posited her limp form on one of 
the full-sized beds. The room was 
a duplicate of mine next door, and I 
unbolted the connecting door on her 
side, then went over and did the 
same on mine. No wrong inten- 
tion, you understand, only good. Jan 
needed help now — and protection. 
Like Nelot had said of Aria. 

Turning out the bright overhead 
lights, leaving only her bedlamp 
burning, I returned to my own room. 
But not for long. 

“Chuck,” she called, her voice 
sounding fuzzy and uncertain. 

When I returned to her room, 
she was sitting on the edge of the 
bed, swaying slightly. “Where am 
I?” she asked dazedly. 

“In your own room,” I told her, 
“and I’m right next door. So don’t 
be afraid of anything — especially 
of me. And I want you to go to 
bed now and get the rest you need. 
I’m leaving the connecting door ajar, 
and you call me if you need me. 
Any time of the night.” 

Suddenly I was very tired myself.

“All right, Chuck,” she agreed 
submissively. *Than]^ again and 
good night.” 

“I*m going to tub now and turn 
in myself,” I told her, almost losing 
my trance as 1 went through into 
my own room. “Good night.” 

It was then 1 remember that Jan’s 
eyes, though blue, seemed to have 
golden glints in them when tears 
were in their comers. That her hair, 
chestnut brown, had glinted golden 
at certain angles under the bedlamp. 
What it all meant 1 couldn’t imagine. 

I shook my head to clear it. 

X ater, as I lay between the cool 
sheets and was about to doze 
off, I thought I heard movement in 
Jan’s room. But there wasn’t any 
light, in either room. Only a stray 
moonbeam streaked across my floor. 
I was imagining things again. Or was 
I? 

But the patter of soft feet on thick 
carpeting couldn’t be mistaken, and 
then my covers moved and someone 
slid in beside me. 

“Jan?” I husked, unbelievingly. 

“Yes,” a small voice replied. 

I still couldn’t believe it. My hand 
strayed hesitantly toward her and 
touched smooth, warm, naked flesh. 
I yanked the hand back as if I had 
burned it. 

Now look, I’m no Don Juan nor 
even an avid girl-watcher. At the 
same time I haven’t reached the age 
of thirty entirely celibate. My physi- 
cal reaction was swift and urgent, as 
would be that of any normal healthy 
male. There wiasn’t any small voice 
to say no, and I didn’t need one. I 
said it to myself — sternly. 



“What’re you doing here?” I asked 
her. 

“Why I . I . • thought . after 
all you saved my life in elevator. 
You — you paid my — ” 

“And now you think you owe me 
. this — ” 

“Ye-yes.” A barely audible whis- 
per. 

“Sure you know what you’re do- 
ing?” 

“Y-yes. I know.” 

“How old are you?” 

“Al-almost twenty-one.” 

“Married?” 

“No.” — 

“Then you’re a virgin.” It was a 
statement, not a question. 

“Y-yes.” 

I burned. “Get out of here,” I 
snapped. “Out of my bed, Jan. Be- 
fore I change my mind.” 

She got. Swiftly. The soft patter 
of her running feet left me sweating. 
Then I heard her sobbing softly 
over there in her own room. I fek 
like a heel, and I’ll never tell you 
why. 

I lay there quaking as the sobs 
died down in the stillness. Utter 
stillness. It spooked me, and I listen- 
ed. Hard. In a little wMe I thought 
I heard movement lagain over there. 
I padded softly to the connecting 
door, following a moonbeam from 
floor to open window, through 
which it shone. And there on the 
sill was a girl-figure, clearly outlined 
through a sheer nightie against the 
light of the moon. Her hair was 
golden. 

Almost flinging myself across the 
intervening distance, trying to make

no noise diat migihit startle her into 
making the fatal leap, 1 threw my 
aims around — nothing — which 
is what was theire. Nobody. No 
gown. No girl. 1 was imaginmg 
things again. 

Turning to the wall switch, I 
flooded the room widi light* ^<1 
there, in her own bed, curled up 
with the covers pulled tightly about 
her, was Jan. Lxx>king plenty scared. 
'And her eyes were as blue as the 
midday sky, her hair russet brown. 
With no sign of golden glints. 

1 began to breathe again. 

“Oh, it’s you. Chuck,” she said, 
blinking. “What is it? Did I cry out 
in my sleep?” 

“No. Just thought I heard a noise 
in here. Go back to sleep, my dear.” 
1 turned out the li^ts. 

“Thanks some more. Chuck. And 
good night — again.” 

“Thank me not,” was all I man- 
aged to say. “Good night.” 

Guess I’d meant to say something 
funny. Funny ha-ha, you know, not 
funny strange, but nothing occurred 
to me that’d fit. 

Perhaps I was just too damned 
gjad the swell kid didn’t remember. 
Or had it been Jan in my bed at 
all? I’d never know for sure. 

IV 

I must have passed out as soon 
as I hit the hay . 

Prince Bor and Princess Aria of 
Xenor were in each other’s arms, 
and the Mindmaster was smiling with 
satisfaction as he watched them. 

“She’s completely cured,” he as- 
sured Bor. 



“Thanks to my host. Chuck,” Boc 
said. 

“And to my dear litde hostess,” 
Aria put in. “Really, my dear Bor, 
I think it was she who was most 
reqKxnsible for my cure. She was 
marvelous, and I hope the things I 
made her do won’t get her into any 
trouble.” 

‘Trouble? No — no trouble,” 
said the Mindmaster. 

“What can we do for them. Ne- 
lot?” asked Bor. 

“Let me think, let me think.” 
Nelot looked like a kindly old gen- 
tleman in a clerical robe. “We must 
and we can do real favors for them 
both. I shall tbinic of something and 
arrange for it. Meanwhile, you two 
get out idiere on the bialoony and 
show yourselves to your subjects. 
They’re awaiting the good news — 
eag^y.” 

The mists closed in . • • 

A t 6:30 A.M. I woke up, feeling 
strangely alone. For a mo- 
ment I couldn’t remember wh«:e I 
was or why. Had I dreamed all this? 
I stumbled to the connecting door 
and found it locked on the other dde. 
Knocking on it brought no response, 
so I tried die telephone. 

“Room 2930 does not answer,” 
the operator told me aJter long ring- 
ing. “Just a moment. Sir.” Then, 
after a half minute: “Miss Jones 
checked out at six. Mister Radford.” 
The time it took me to shave, 
shower and dress was negli^ble. 

There was no message in my box 
when I inquired downstairs — not 
a thing. She might at least have left 
a note, I thought on the spur of the 




moment. But then 1 guessed it was 
just as well and I decided to ohialk 
it off against experience — forget it. 

The money, you ask? Never would 
have felt right about the winnings 
anyway. I^ad to earn mine. Besides 
which, I knew that the Mindmaster 
out there — and Bor — really 
managed the phenomenal luck. 

In another hour 1 was on a plane 
for LA. The weather was beautiful, 
and the passengers either grumpy or 
mirdiful, depending on what i^eir 
luck had been. WTtich meant that 
most of them were quiet, staring out 
the windows. Only about three be- 
sides the hostesses wore smiles. 

Then everything changed. I was 
in one of those little aircars of 
Xenor, heading over the dty toward 
the pdace. The streets below were 
in uproarious celebration, long 
streamers draped the buildings and 
fluttered over the milling crowds. 
The Small Folk, flitted everywhere, 
caroling. Even the sun seemed to 
be more brilliant, and Mount Leo’s 
halo spun and tilted crazily. 

Bor and Aria stood on the bal- 
cony, and the multitude in the plaza 
was jubilant. Shouting, dancing, hug- 
ging one lanother indiscriminately. If 
this was in LA, the police would be 
wondering when to step in. 

Unexpectedly and mysteriously, 
then, I was in the Mindmaster’s 
mind, and he was in mine. He stood 
behind the prince and princess, and 
for a short time I was seeing through 
his eyes and hearing through his ears 
how the joyous celebrants in the 
plaza down there were making 
known their love for their princess 
and her consort.

The two objects of their subjects’ 
acclaim remained enclasped and 
were obviously the happiest couple 
in Xenor. Perhaps in all of Tau Ce- 
ti II. That they were very much in 
love with each other and with their 
people was patent. 

T he aircar I occupied took a sud- 
den leap and zoomed upward 
at iuoredible speed as Nelot’s think- 
ing told me we would visit selected 
spots on the daylight side of his 
planet. Which is what happened. As 
in one of our travelogues, I saw and 
sensed and heard the land of this 
world at various points and from 
many angles. Now we were over an 
inky sea that I knew separated us 
from the only other continent. Over 
hundreds of kilometers of well kept 
blue and orange farm lands with 
prim living and service buildings. 
The rose-misted mountains provided 
a background for it all, and then we 
swooped down into another colorful 
city with tall pyramidal buildings 
and parades and celebrations much 
the same as in Xenor. I learned that 
their language was different here. 
The people, too, were proportioned 
differently, being shorter and with 
broader features. But the Small Folk 
were everywhere, the same here and 
just as happy. 

Now we were in a purple jungle, 
sweeping over waving fronds of tall 
feathery growths. Down into a clear- 
ing where nearly naked, deeply 
tanned, natives performed a joyous 
dance about what looked to be a 
three-meter-taJl layer cake with 
imaiges of their ^ers, the prince 
and princess, topping it all. 



The tour continued, end I pirac- 
dcally felt my eyes bugging ifrom 
my head. But the Mindmasiter’s 
thoughts held me in complete en- 
thrallment. 

“We’ve seen enough,” he at length 
conveyed, “enough so you know 
how truly grateful are our people. 
To you and to the one you call Jan 
we have caused to 1^ engraved 
medals which convey our humble 
thanks — in your own tongue — 
for your invaluable help.” 

He pressed a heavy packet into 
my hands be:&>re 1 could object or 
reply and concluded: “For your part 
and hers in the cure of our prin- 
cess. For oiu: own sent . 

A soft hand was tapping my shoul- 
der, a soft voice telling me, “We 
are over Los Angeles and will land 
in Ontario Airport in ten minutes. 
Sir. Please fasten your seat belt.” A 
sniiMng hostess. 

The little aircar had multiplied in 
size and completely changed charac- 
ter. I saw up front the lighted sign: 
PLEASE FASTEN SEAT BELTS. 
NO SMOKING. It was one of our 
own airliners. But the heavy packet, 
with its outworidly wrappings, was 
on my knees. 

H aving parked my Thunderbird 
out back, I came into my of- 
fice through the rear door and didn’t 
notice for a moment that I had a 
visitor — a big character who 
sprawled all over my best leather- 
upholstered client’s chair. 

“Who’re you and bow’d you get 
in?” I asked all in one breath. 

“Pushed past your gal out front. 
She said you was away, and she 




didn’t seem to know or care when 
you’d be back. So I told her Fd 
wait right here if it was for a week.” 
Then 1 got a good look at him. 
Fiftyish. A character all right, but 
he did have a disarming grin. Ten 
gallon hat, which he never bothered 
to take off, cowboy rig that fitted 
him badly over his generous pouch, 
and — so help me! — high heeled 
boots with spurs! 

He tossed a card expertly to my 
desk top and stood up. The card 
read: JEFFERS AND PELL, 

ENGINEERS AND CONSTRUC- 
TORS, BAKERSFIELD, CAL. 

“I’m Jeffers,” he declared, rising 
and sticking out a big homy paw. 
“Senior partner.” They were a well 
known, well thought of outfit. 

I evaded the grip, which I could 
see was meant to be crushing, and 
a quick thumb-bend brought him to 
one knee, red-faced. 

“Sorry,” I said. But I wasn’t. 
“Must have slipped,” he mum- 
bled as he got up. 

I could have sworn I heard a 
muffled feminine giggle. I’d have 
Miss Bailey on the carpet if I found 
she’d been eavesdropping. 

“Now what might be your busi- 
ness, Mister Jeffers?” I was again 
back of my desk, and he in the chair. 

He guffawed and I simply had to 
laugh with him, this buffon. 

Then he sobered. “I’m offering 
you a contract, a job. You know 
we have the rdnfordng steel mostly 
welded up and are almost ready to 
start pouring concrete on the Kern 
County Dam, I suppose?” 

“Yes, I know that.” 

Jeffers lowered his voice. “I want 



you to make a complete inspection 
now and after the dam is compleled. 
The fee is fifty grand, and 111 add 
25 more if you — weU — oveUodk 
a few things.” 

“You mean you’re cutting down 
on materials, on quaiity, event on 
workmanship — and want me for a 
cover-up.” 

The man hemmed a little, reddeor 
ed anew. “Y-you might say thaL” 
This time I didn’t merely bum; I 
blazed: “Go plumb to hell, will you? 
And get out of here fast!” 

The reaction was amazing. Jeffers 
fell out of the chair, yelling with 
laughter, holding his sides as he 
rolled over and over on my best 
rug. “You’ll do, you’ll do, young 
fellow!” he roared. 

Then, from the washroom stepped 
a vision, if ever there was one. 

66 Tan!” I shouted, then halted my 
al rush toward her. 

She was bending over Jeffers, 
helping him back po his chair. “See, 
daddy,” she exulted. “Didn’t I tell 
you?” 

As she stood up to face me, 1 
guess I stared like a stupe. She was 
the living image of Bor’s princess 
Aria in far-off Xenor. Excepting for 
color of eyes and hair — the image. 
Same faultless ivory skin, same 
traffic-stopping figure. But what was 
this daddy business? 

“I’m Joyce Jeffers,” she explained 
before I could ask. “And I had to 
prove two things to daddy. First you. 
He didn’t believe there was a young 
engineer from LA with in-integrity 
like I described. And then I had to 
prove I’d had amnesia.”

157 




“Aimiesia?” 1 felt still more 
stupid. 

*'Yes, and 1 suppose this seems 
strange to you too, but from the 
time 1 left home until that — that 
night I wasn’t Joyce Jeffers but 
Janice Jones. And yet now I remem- 
ber — well most all — what hap- 
pened during the Vegas days. Only 
sometimes 1 was Jan and sometimes 
— Aria.” 

“Aria? You know then?” I moved 
closer to the vision. 

The long lashes dropped, then 
raised again so she could regard 
me as 1 thirstily took her in from 
the top of her faultless coiffure to 
her silken knees, calves, ankles. “Yes 
Bor,” she whispered. 

“Geel” I exclaimed like a school- 
boy. Her dad was looking on with 
a broad grin on his puss. 

“Beat it, Pop,” I told him, and 
he tippy-toed toward the outer 
door. 

She arched those pouty, kissable 
red lips, revealing glistening white 
teeth in a dazzling but really human 
and understanding smile. Her face 
was turned up to mine, and she was 
so close now that the scent she used 
was strong in my nostrils. 

What was a guy supposed to do? 

Just what I did, and thoroughly. 
Hungrily. For this is what I had 



spent all my previous life to earn 
— without knowing it 

Time stood still, but at length we 
were in this world and had opened 
the packet from Tau Ceti U and 
were examining its contents hand in 
hand and with our heads very close 
together. 

There were two beautifully exe- 
cuted medallions, made of an ex- 
tremely heavy metal that looked 
like platinum but was iridescent. 
Most beautifully engraved on these 
were the words the Mindmaster had 
hinted at. Joyce’s name was correct 
and correctly spelled. So was mine, 
even to the “Charles,” which I de- 
tested but put up with. This Nelot 
knew much more about us than we 
did ourselves. 

The left edge of my medallion 
was notched to slip into and form 
a supplement to Joyce’s. In fact when 
the two slid toge^er it was like a 
single larger plaque. 

“Why don’t we?” breathed Joyce. 

“First preacher I can get,” said I. 

And we agreed afterward that we 
bad then heard a trio of delighted 
musical chuckles, one bass, one 
tenor, and the other a rich contralto. 
Besides a cheery chorus of flutterings 
and the exultant chant: knew. 

We knew.”

HUE 

AND 

CRY 



Dear Editor: 

IF is one of my favorite SP maga- 
zines — and it's also one of the 
worst magazines on the market. 
story done well — based on a poor 
subject is more salable than a good 
story done around a good idea — 
wihen the latter is written without 
any skill.” Now I'm not saying that 
IF has no time or effort put into it 

— evidently quite a lot of work 
goes into the mag — work is need- 
ed to produce anything approaching 
a magazine. However, it's apparent 
that not enough work goes toto IP. 

You, Mr. Pohl, should not be con- 
tent to let a writer develop all 
by himself. If it looks like you’re 
getting a new author that has some 
potential, work with him a little bit 

— Dannie Plachta came up with his 
first decent story in the July, 1966, 
issue. And it’s pretty visible that 
the*development of this new writer 
has been through the work of the 
author alone. 

Looking back at Robert A. Hein- 
lein’s The Moon ia a Harsh Mistress, 
you can see a story that could have 
been vastly improved with a little 
editorial help. Heinlein looked like 
he was coming back into the swing- 
of-things with this one. And then 
what does he do for a conclusion? 
He gives a lecture. 

Boy, what a let down. 



You, Mr. Pohl, could have shown 
Heinlein what the public wanted. 
Through a discussion between my- 
self and several other fans it has 
been * decided that Heinlein’s big 
problem has been his conclusions. 
Look at the racially biased Sixth 
Column (in paperback: The Dau 
After Tomorrow") at least the end- 
ing continues and concluded the plot. 

I’m not saying that our hard- 
working editor, (alias Frederik 
Pohl) should have forced Heinlein 
to peddle his piece to another mag 
— but what I do say is this : 

Work with your magazines. Im- 
press your personality upon your 
magazines. If you have an author 
that looks like a prospective Giant 
in the Earth, work with the man. 
And work with the authors so that 
we can have more stories that fit 
into IP and give the audience more 
to appreciate. 

IF is an extremely weird position; 
this is the only magazine that can 
bridge the gap between “Quality” 
science fiction and science fiction 
for “Entertainment”. That bridge is 
your best' bet. And the bridge can 
only be built through a lot of hard 
work on the part of the editor. 

Cross “entertaining” stories with 
quality materials, and what have 
you got? You’ve got the most popur 
lar type of story in a growing genre. 



159 



This cross is the thing that’s go- 
ing to bring an increase in dinni- 
lation — not the advertisements for 
the ‘‘Rosicmcians.” 

Oh yeah — in ‘‘Hue and Cry”, let 
the heading of each letter be what 
the writer originally intended it to 
be. This letter is not headed with 
“Dear Editor”, and that heading 
just looks a little too much like 
something out of a comic book. In 
other words, don’t change the head- 
ings for uniformity’s sake. There's

Dear Editor: 

I noticed Mr. Arthur C. Clarke’s 
letter in the June If. There is in- 
deed a story entitled The Anticipa- 
tor which ends with the line, “And 
the anticipator, horribly afraid, ran 
down a by-street.” It is not by H. G. 
Wells, however. It is by Morley 
Robeiis and appeared in his The 
Grinder^s Wheel (Nelson, 1907) and 
was reprinted in Dorothy L. Say- 
ers’ The Omnibus of Crime (Har- 
court. Brace and Co., 1929), which 
is where I found it. This is all the 
information I have about the story. 

I suggest that you refuse to pass 
this information on to Arthur C. 
Clarke, at least until he ajgrees to 
write a new novel which will be 
serialized in If. 

I thought that the style of Mr. 
Leslie A. Beece’s letter in the same 
issue seemed unpleasantly familiar. 
When I checked the address I dis- 
covered, lo and behold, that Mr. 
Reece has the same address as 
Stephen E. Pickering, who writes 
in the same pointlessly polysyllabic 



fashion as Mr. Reece. Is this the 
reason, perhaps^ that Mr. Reese be- 
moans the fact that fans “have com- 
pletely ignored . writings of the 
fan-sociologist Stephen Pickering 
. ”? Has the secret identity of 
Stephen Pickering been unveiled? 

Now that you have Andre Norton 
and Samuel Delany in If, don’t let 
them get away. I must, however, say 
that Driftglass was far below De- 
lany’s usual high standards. 

When the heck are we going to 
get the next HEINLEIN novel? — 
Hank Davis, 361 Linden Walk, Lex- 
ington, Kentucky 40508. 

# You’ll get the next Heinlein the 
minute we can bring it to you — but 
when that will be is anyone’s guess. 
The counfounded man is building 
himself a new house, and until that’s 
done, no novels! 

Incidentally, the identity of the 
“Wells” story was tracked down 
also by Robert A. Gould, Frank 
McSherry, Jr., Robert Coulson, Dean 
McLaughlin, Donald Franson and 
— oh, yes, Arthur Clarke himself, 
shortly after we printed his letter. 
— Editor.

Dear Editor: 

I started reading If about five 
years ago when it was in the dol- 
drums and have watched it grow 
and grow imtil now it is the finest 
science-fiction mag around. In fact, 
I have been reading If for so long 
that I feel like one of the oldtimers. 
I have just finished The Iron Thom 
and, although I have reservations, 
consider it one of the finest sci-fi 
novels I have ever read. 

Budrys’s work has always been 
good, and his only fault was that he 
did not write often enough, a fault 
which you seem to be correcting. 
Let me add that he is also my fav- 
orite book critic. It is a pleasure 






160 




to read someone who does not in- 
discriminately recommend every sci- 
fi book on the miarket. If I bought 
every book the other reviewers rec- 
ommended, I would soon be poverty- 
stricken. So Budrys's column comes 
as a breath of fresh air. However, 
I intended to write about Budrys the 
author, not Budrys the critic, and I 
do have one criticism of The Iron 
Thom, After all the care with which 
Budrys built tip the complex so- 
ciety of Amsirs and (humans, and 
the fascinating odyssey of Honor 
Jackson to Ea^, the final chapters 
come as a disappointment. I do not 
know what I expected, but cer- 
tainly not the same sterile society 
seen before in countless inferior 
novels, and presented in sudi a 
dull fashion. Up to this point The 
Iron Thom had been fresh npd in- 
ventive, but suddenly the author’s 
imagination deserts him. I feel that 
Budrys, who has always taken the 
trouble to create real people for his 
stories, spent so much time in cha- 
racterization and striving to avoid 
the usual space-opera cliches, that 
he forgot about his plot. By the time 
the novel ends, nothing is resolved, 
either on Earth or Mars. I would 
like to know what happened be- 
tween the Amsirs and the humans 
after Jackson left Mars, and I would 
like to see more of Jackson’s ad- 
ventures on Earth. It seems to me 
that the author ended The Iron 
Thom before he finished his story. 
Of course, there is always the pos- 
sibility that I am criticising Budrys 
for writing a differ^t story from 
that which he wanted to write, in 
which case I apologize, but I still 
think that the last quarter of The 
Iron Thom does not measure up 
to the first three quarters. 

Tuminjg to another topic, a recent 
article in Variety reports that Star 



Trek has been renewed for next 
season which surely comes as good 
news to all // readers. It is a 
pleasure to see good science fiction 
on TV after ibeing inundated with 
tripe like Lost In Space and The 
Time TunneL The latter is not even 
science fiction, but an adventure 
series with a “you are there” gim- 
mick. Your letter column has been 
full of comments on Star Trek and 
TV sci-fi, but no one ever writes 
about those recent movies: The Fan- 
tastic Voyage and the great Fah- 
renheit J^51, Don’t fans go to the 
movies any more? — Patrick Swift, 
2870 Marion Avenue, Bronx, New 
York 10458.

Dear Editor: 

This thing about your artwork for 
If has been going on for quite some 
time now, and I don’t see where 
anything has dianged; at least not 
for the better. I remember back 
when Galaxy was just starting out, 
in an editorial, the editor (H. L. 
Gold) said something like, “In this 
issue, you can see the changes that 
you, the readers, have voted for.” 

Now I feel that even though that 
was way back in the fourth issue of 
Galaxy, I think that you still wish 
to live up to your old policy. After 
all, it is us readers that keep your 
magazine going I So why not take 
a poll, and see what changes the 
readers would like? I know that you 
can’t please all the readers all the 
time, but I’m sure that most of the 
readers would like to see a change 
in the artwork in If. Why not ask 
them and see? I Do us both a favor, 
publish this letter in Hue & Cry, 
and see what the rest of your read- 
ers think. 

While your art isn’t the best, 
your stories are, and they won you 
your Hugo. Keep up the good stor- 



HUE & CRY 



161 




ies, and you will get another Hugo. 
Just another reason to improve your 
art; why can^t a first-class maga- 
zine (which is what the Hugo repre- 
sents) have first-class art? 

Glad to see that you have Philip 
Jose Farmer coming up in If. He 
has to be one of the most original 
authors living! And his ‘"River- 
world” series is great. Another good 
writer that, seems to do quite a lot 
for you is Larry Niven. 

One last thing, do you see the 
publishing of your and Mr. William- 
sony novel, Rogue Star, anytime 
soon? — Randall Richmond, 10502 
Shadow Wood Drive, Houston, Tex- 
as 77043. 

# Some time in the next few months 
— we hope. It would have been run- 
ning by now but we keep getting 
stories by others that politeness 
directs us to run first! — Editor.

Dear Editor: 

Wherever youVe keeping Ifs 
Hugo, make room for more. On the 
basis of the first five issues of 
1967, especially the March issue, 
youVe got it made. 

Your habit of overlapping serials 
is a superb one, especially when 
you have serials by Budrys, Chand- 
ler and Laumer. Terry Carr and 
Larry Niven are the finds of the 
year . any year. And then there 
is the Berserker series by Fred 
Saberhagen. YouVe performed an 
invaluable service by encouraging 
new authors, 

^ Oh, yes. You hinted at the possi- 
bility of an addition to your line-up 
of magazines — then silence. What's 
cooking? — David Charles Paskow, 
817 West 66th Avenue, Philadelphia, 
Pennsylvania 19126. 

# Coming off the back burner soon : 
International Science Fiction, the 
same being a new magazine devoted 

162 



to publishing stories from other 
parts of the planet Earth, as for 
instance Russia, Germany, France, 
Australia, etc. — Editor,

Dear Editor: 

7/'s policy of giving new writers 
their start is paying off: The Soft 
Weapon, by Larry Niven, is one of 
the best sf stories, by a new or old 
writer, that I have ever read. If 
I may be sacrilegious, I think it's 
as exciting as anything Asimov or 
Clarke or Heinlein has ever done. 

One question: since the February 
issue came out in 1966, is The Soft 
Weapon eligible for awards for '66 
or '67? — Jeff Rensch, Webb School, 
Claremont, California 91711. 

• For 1967, according to our read- 
ing of the rules . and we agree 
that it's a worthy nomination! 

That does us for another month. 
This month's “first” is To Serve The 
Masters, by Perry A. Chapdelaine, 
a mathematics professor from Ten- 
nessee. We don't often run a writer's 
maiden effort as long as this one 
. but we don't often get one like 
To Serve the Masters, either! 

In case you missed the earlier 
discussions, what these ‘firsts"" are 
all about is simply that every issue 
we bring you at least one writer 
who has never been in print with a 
science-fiction story before. Where 
do they come from? In the mail — 
submitted to If at its regular edi- 
torial office, neatly typed, double- 
spaced, white paper, with stamped 
self-addressed return envelope en- 
closed. Are they required to follow 
special rules? No; they are con- 
sidered along, with stories by our 
regulars and have to compete with 
them for interest. Who do they 
come from? Why, often enough, 
someone very much like you. • •
