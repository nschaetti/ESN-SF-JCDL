GENIACS FOR A SONG! 
other people may need enormous machines at great expense to 
compose music but our GENIACS do the job for only $19.95. 
Ttie special booklet of instructions was developed by a customer (only 16 years old at the time) who learned to design 
computers from the GBNIAC he bought. If you feel like 
Binging a new tune while the mid-summer madness is on 
you, rush us an order for a CJENIAC. 
GBN'IAr the Klectric Brain Construction Kit is a complete course (seven books and manuals) plus all the parts 
(over 400 compwients and piere.s of equipment Including a 
display rack, special switches, etc.) for making forty differerent computing, reasoning, music composing and gameplaying machines. 
Already in use by hundreds of schools, colleges, professional scientists, amateurs and students GBN1A.C teaches 
you aiow to build simple computers from scratch — gives yem 
all the parts and know-how with wiring diagrams and stephy-step instructions. When you have completed all the experiments in our manuals, and studied the texts you can 
actually design new machines. 
GBNIAttS are easy to build, require no soldering, operate on a flashlight battery and when you are finished with 
those in the manual you can bufld your own (we have a 
contest, too. for the best designs). 
Order your GBNTAC now, only $19.95 postpaid, (add 89d west of the 
Mississippi, $2.00 outside the United States). 7-day return guarantee. 
Is Your Time Running Out? Try 
HYPERSPEED READING 
... for me this meant increasing my reading speed 
from 600 to 1800 words per minute, enough to finish a 
novel in half an hour, to triple the number of technical 
jtnimals and reports I read. Much to my surprise my 
comprehension went up and studying became easier as 
1 enjoyed reading more. 
I went from normal reading speed to hyperspeed 
reading In thirty hours of intensive reading practice at 
a leading reading clinic, and immediately thought how 
wonderful It would be for people who don't have the 
time or opportunity to take such improvement work to 
do It at home, for several Iwurs a day. 
Ever since then I have gathered materials which are 
proven, widely used and time-tested in clinics, schools 
and reading centers but are adaptable to use by adults 
working at home without supen’ision. You will immediately increase your reading speed with them if your 
reading habits are correct but can be accelerated, with 
practice. 
If you have reading difficulties they will be brought 
out In the diagnostic reading test we include and will 
analyze with recommendations at no extra cost to you. 
'Pho kit includes a reading rate accelerator with cards, 
two books of practice materials with technical exercises 
that test reading speed and comprehension, and a booklet on hyperspeed reading.

manual, technical reading manual, and discussion of 
hyperspecd reading plus diagnostic reading test wltl

THE RICHEST PLANET 
' I ^HREE years ago, an editorial 
based on The Amazing Amazon by Willard Price (John Day) 
seemed about to cause a mass 
migration by refuting the argument that Earth — gutted, overcrowded — should be abandoned 
for other planets. But authors 
have been falling back into the 
easy falsehood of a poor, jammed 
Earth. Jarring them with more 
of Price’s astonishing statistics 
might not be a bad idea. 
In size and phenomena, the 
Amazon River is cosmic enough 
to belong to science fiction rather 
than fact. Here, listen: 
The mouth of the river is 200 
miles wide — ten times as wide 
as the English Channel, twice as 
wide as the Mediterranean. Even 
a fast airliner takes half an hour 
to cross it. 
This “moving sea,” as Willard 
Price rightly calls it, represents 
one-fifth of all the running fresh 
water on Earth! 
“Place the mouth of the Amazon at New York,” states Price, 
“and its arms would reach up 
into Canada and down into Mexico and almost to California.” 
With its 1100 known tributaries, 
many of them larger than the 
Rhine, it drains 3,000,000 square 
miles — an area nearly as huge 
as the entire U.S.A. 
This most gigantic of rivers 
even has a tide, a monstrous 
wave known as the pororoca, ten 
to 15 feet high, which races up 
as far as Santarem once a month 
at the murderous rate of 45 miles 
an hour. 
One of the three large islands 
at the mouth of the river, Marajo, 
is as big as Denmark or Switzerland! 
A hundred miles offshore, a 
ship can drop buckets and bring 
up drinkable water, for the 60 
billion gallons per hour sweep out 
with such force that the Amazon 
goes on flowing right in the ocean 
itself. 
The League of Nations estimated that Brazil could accommodate 900 million people. But 
agricultural and industrial productivity have increased so greatly since then that this figure 
could easily be enlarged by 25 
to 50% — about half the present 
population of Earth! 
Amazonia is so unthinkably 
rich in natural resources that it 
could give its citizens the most 
lavish economy in history — with 
enough left over to fuel and feed 
the machines, factories and people 
of the world. 
Here are the greatest deposits 
of high-grade iron ore on all 
Earth, plus industrial diamonds, 
gold, manganese and just about 
(Continued on Page 6) 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
( Continued from Page 5 ) 
every other metal and mineral. 
Geologists declare that half of 
Brazil floats on oil. Nowhere on 
this planet is there deeper, blacker 
topsoil. 
“The great forests of Canada 
and Russia are thin compared 
with those of Brazil,” says Price, 
“and they take 400 years to 
grow. An Amazon forest rises to 
full stature in one-eighth of that 
time . and provides food, 
drink, rubber, belting, industrial 
oils, ropes and fibers, wax, chewing gum, insulation, bedding, insecticides, medicines, button, dyes 
and hundreds of other articles 
of daily use.” 
We think of Argentina as a 
great cattle country. But Brazil 
has 40 million head as against 
Argentina’s 32 million and can 
support 75 million — more than 
any other land. 
Brazil supplies 98.2% of all 
quartz crystal, essential in the 
building of precision instruments; 
beryllium and tantalum, over 80%. 
Zirconium comes only from Brazil. There are plentiful deposits 
of chrome, nickel, cobalt. 
“If the supply of the vital 
metal, manganese, is cut off from 
Russia and India,” the author assures us, “the western hemisphere’s only source would be 
Amazonia . there’s lots of it.” 
I mentioned iron deposits; the 
actual figure is nearly a third of 
the world’s iron reserves. 
Sharks, tarpons, sawfishes, 
swordfishes, porpoises and manatees thrive in the Amazon. So do 
over 1800 species, compared with 
the 150 of all the rivers of Europe, and more than the whole 
Atlantic from pole to pole. 
“Amazon fish,” Price says, “are 
of such gigantic size that one 
fish will fill an unconscionable 
number of cans . The day 
seems to be coming when the 
Amazon will surpass Alaskan and 
North American rivers in canned 
fish and fish by-products.” 
There’s just too much data in 
The Amazing Amazon — it spills, 
it gushes, it pours with a flood 
of richness matched only by the 
Amazon itself. You can’t dip into 
the book; you’ll find yourself 
thrashing through it, demanding 
impatiently, “Let’s go! What are 
we waitings for?” 
Aim for the planets and stars? 
Of course. But the colonization ^ 
of Amazonia is possible the minute we clear out the animals and 
insects — and we have the means 
to do it now — and no giant spaceships with small payloads are 
needed, no sealed domes or oxygen and water extractors, refrigeration or heating units of 
awesome capacity. 
Amazonia is right here and it 
makes Earth the richest planet 
in the Solar System!

WOLFBANE 
BEGINNING A 2-PART SERIAL 
By FREDERIK POHL and C. M. KORNBLUTH 
Appallingly, the Earth and the Moon had been 
kidnapped from the Solar System — but who were 
the kidnappers and what ransom did they want? 
Illustrated by WOOD 
I 
R OGET Germyn, banker, 
of Wheeling, West Virginia, a Citizen, woke 
gently from a Citizen’s dreamless 
sleep. It was the third-hour-rising time, the time proper to a 
day of exceptional opportunity 
to appreciate. 
Citizen Germyn dressed himself in the clothes proper for the 
appreciation of great works— such 
as viewing the Empire State ruinsagainst storm clouds from a small 
boat, or walking in silent single 
file across the remaining course of 
the Golden Gate Bridge. Or as 
today— one hoped— witnessing the 
Re-creation of the Sun. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
Germyn with difficulty retained 
a Citizen’s necessary calm. One 
was tempted to meditate on improper things: Would the Sun be 
re-created? What if it were not? 
He put his mind to his dress. 
First of all, he put on an old and 
storied bracelet, a veritable identity bracelet of heavy silver links 
and a plate which was inscribed: 
PFC JOE HARTMANN 
Korea 
1953 
His fellow jewelry-appreciators 
would have envied him that 
bracelet— if they had been capable of such an emotion as envy. 
No other ID bracelet as much as 
two hundred and fifty years old 
was known to exist in Wheeling. 
His finest shirt and pair of 
light pants went next to his skin, 
and over them he wore a loose 
parka whose seams had been 
carefully weakened. When the 
Sun was re-created, every five 
years or so, it was the custom to 
remove the parka gravely and 
rend it with the prescribed graceful gestures . but not so drastically that it could not be 
stitched together again. Hence 
the weakened seams. 
This was, he counted, the fortyfirst day on which he and all of 
Wheeling had donned the appropriate Sun Re-creation clothing. It was the forty-first day on 
which the Sun — no longer white, 
no longer blazing yellow, no 
longer even bright red — had 
risen and displayed a color that 
was darker maroon and always 
darker. 
TT had, thought Citizen Germyn, never grown so dark 
and so cold in all of his life. Perhaps it was an occasion for special viewing. For surely it would 
never come again, this opportunity to see the old Sun so near to 
death . 
One hoped. 
Gravely, Citizen Germyn completed his dressing, thinking only 
of the act of dressing itself. It 
was by no means his specialty, 
but he considered, when it was 
done, that he had done it well, 
in the traditional flowing gestures, 
with no flailing, at all times balanced lightly on the ball of the 
foot. It was all the more perfectly consummated because no 
one saw it but himself. 
He woke his wife gently, by 
placing the palm of his hand on 
her forehead as she lay neatly, 
in the prescribed fashion, on the 
Woman’s Third of the bed. 
The warmth of his hand gradually penetrated the layers of 
sleep. Her eyes demurely opened, 
“Citizeness Germyn,” he greeted her, making the assurance-ofidentity sign with his left hand. 
“Citizen Germyn,” she said, 
TO 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
with the assurance-of-identity inclination of the head which was 
prescribed when the hands are 
covered. 
He retired to his tiny study. 
It was the time appropriate to 
meditation on the properties of 
Connectivity. Citizen Germyn 
was skilled in meditation, even 
for a banker; it was a grace in 
which he had schooled himself 
since earliest childhood. 
Citizen Germyn, his young face 
composed, his slim body erect as 
he sat but in no way tense or 
straining, successfully blanked 
out, one after another, all of the 
external sounds and sights and 
feelings that interfered with 
proper meditation. His mind was 
very nearly vacant except of one 
central problem: Connectivity. 
Over his head and behind, out 
of sight, the cold air of the room 
seemed to thicken and form a — 
call it a blob; a blob of air. 
There was a name for those 
blobs of air. They had been seen 
before. They were a known fact 
of existence in Wheeling and in 
all the world. They came. They 
hovered. And they went away — 
sometimes not alone. If someone 
had been in the room with Citizen Germyn to look at it, he 
would have seen a distortion, a 
twisting of what was behind the 
blob, like flawed glass, a lens, 
like an eye. And they were called 
Eye. 
Germyn meditated. 
The blob of air grew and slowly moved. A vagrant current that 
spun out from it caught a fragment of paper and whirled it to 
the floor. Germyn stirred. The 
blob retreated. 
Germsm, all unaware, disciplined his thoughts to disregard 
the interruption, to return to the 
central problem of Connectivity. 
The blob hovered . 
From the other room, his wife’s 
small, thrice-repeated throatclearing signaled to him that she 
was dressed. Germyn got up to go 
to her, his mind returning to the 
world; and the overhead Eye 
spun relentlessly, and disappeared. 
S OME miles east of Wheeling, 
Glenn Tropile — of a class 
which found it wisest to give 
itself no special name, and which 
had devoted much time and 
thought to shaking the unwelcome name it had been given — 
awoke on the couch of his apartment. 
He sat up, shivering. It was 
cold. The damned Sun was still 
bloody dark outside the window 
and the apartment was soggy and 
chilled. 
He had kicked off the blankets 
in his sleep. Why couldn’t he 
learn to sleep quietly, like anybody else? Lacking a robe, he 
clutched the blankets around him. 
WOLFBANE 
got up and walked to the unglassed window. 
It was not unusual for Glenn 
Tropile to wake up on his couch. 
This happened because Gala Tropile had a temper, was inclined 
to exile him from her bed after 
a quarrel, and — the operative factor — he knew he always had the 
advantage over her for the whole 
day following the night’s exile. 
Therefore the quarrel was worth 
it. An advantage was, by definition, worth anything you paid for 
it or else it was no advantage. 
He could hear her moving 
about in one of the other rooms 
and cocked an ear, satisfied. She 
hadn’t waked him. Therefore she 
was about to make amends. A 
little itch in his spine or his brain 
— it was not a physical itch, so he 
couldn’t locate it; he could only 
be sure that it was there— stopped 
troubling him momentarily; he 
was winning a contest. It was 
Glenn Tropile’s nature to win 
contests . and his nature to 
create them. 
Gala Tropile, young, dark, attractive, with a haunted look, 
came in tentatively carrying coffee from some secret hoard of 
hers. 
Glenn Tropile affected not to 
notice. He stared coldly out at 
the cold landscape. The sea, white 
with thin ice, was nearly out of 
sight, so far had it retreated as 
the little sun waned. 
“Glenn-” ~ 
Ah, good! Glenn. Where was 
the proper mode of first-greetingone’s-husband? Where was the 
prescribed throat-clearing upon 
entering a room? 
Assiduously, he had untaught 
her the meticulous ritual of manners that they had all of them 
been brought up to know; and 
it was the greatest of his many 
victories over her that sometimes, 
now, she was the aggressor, she 
would be the first to depart from 
the formal behavior prescribed 
for Citizens. 
Depravity! Perversion! 
Sometimes they would touch 
each other at times which were 
not the appropriate coming-together times. Gala sitting on her 
husband’s lap in the late evening, perhaps, or Tropile kissing 
her awake in the morning. Sometimes he would force her to let 
him watch her dress — no, not 
now, for the cold of the waning 
sun made that sort of frolic unattractive, but she had permitted 
it before; and such was his mastery over her that he knew she 
would permit it again, when the 
Sun was re-created . 
If, a thought came to him, if 
the Sun was re-created. 
TTE turned away from the cold 
outside and looked at his 
wife. “Good morning, darling.” 
She was contrite. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
He demanded jarringly: “Is 
it?” Deliberately he stretched, deliberately he yawned, deliberately he scratched his chest. Every 
movement was ugly. Gala Tropile quivered, but said nothing. 
Tropile flung himself on the 
better of the two chairs, one hairy 
leg protruding from under the 
wrapped blankets. His wife was 
on her best behavior — in his 
unique terms; she didn’t avert her 
eyes. 
“What’ve you got there?” he 
asked. “Coffee?” 
“Yes, dear. I thought — ” 
“Where’d you get it?” 
The haunted eyes looked away. 
Still better, thought Glenn Tropile, more satisfied even than 
usual; she’s been ransacking an 
old warehouse again. It was a 
trick he had taught her, and like 
all of the illicit tricks she had 
learned from him, a handy 
weapon when he chose to use it. 
It was not prescribed that a 
Citizen should rummage through 
Old Places. A Citizen did his 
work, whatever that work might 
be — banker, baker or furniture 
repairman. He received what rewards were his due for the work 
he did. A Citizen never took anything that was not his due — not 
even if it lay abandoned and rotting. 
It was one of the differences 
between Glenn Tropile and the 
people he moved among. 
I’ve got it made, he exulted; * 
it was what I needed to clinch 
my victory over her. 
He spoke: “I need you more 
than I need coffee. Gala.” 
She looked up, troubled. 
“What would I do,” he demanded, “if a beam fell on you 
one day while you were scrambling through the fancy groceries? 
How can you take such chances? 
Don’t you know what you mean 
to me?” 
She sniffed a couple of times. 
She said brokenly: “Darling, 
about last night — I’m sorry — ” 
and miserably held out the cup. 
He took it and set it down. He 
took her hand, looked up at her, 
and kissed it lingeringly. He felt 
her tremble. Then she gave him 
a wild, adoring look and flung 
herself into his arms. 
A new dominance cycle was 
begun at the moment he returned 
her frantic kisses. 
Glenn knew, and Gala knew, 
that he had over her an edge, an 
advantage — the weather gauge, 
initiative of fire, percentage, the 
can’t-lose lack of tension. Call it 
anything, but it was life itself 
to such as Glenn Tropile. He 
knew, and she knew, that having 
the advantage he would press it 
and she would yield — on and on, 
in a rising spiral. 
He did it because it was his 
life, the attaining of an advantage over anyone he might en

counter; because he was (unwelcomely but justly) called a Son 
of the Wolf. 
A WORLD away, a Pyramid 
squatted sullenly on the 
planed-off top of the highest peak 
of the Himalayas. 
It had not been built there. It 
had not been carried there by 
Man or Man’s machines. It had — 
come, in its own time,* for its own 
reasons. 
Did it wake on that day, the 
thing atop Mount Everest, or did 
it ever sleep? Nobody knew. It 
stood, or sat, there, approximately a tetrahedron. Its appearance 
was known: constructed on a 
base line of some thirty-five 
yards, slaggy, midnight-blue in 
color. Almost nothing else about 
it was known — at least, to mankind. 
It was the only one of its kind 
on Earth, though men thought 
(without much sure knowledge) 
that there were more, perhaps 
many thousands more, like it on 
the unfamiliar planet that was 
Earth’s binary, swinging around 
the miniature Sun that hung at 
their common center of gravity 
like an unbalanced dumbbell. But 
men knew very little about that 
planet itself, only that it had 
come out of space and was now 
there. 
Time was when men had tried 
to label that binary, more than 
two centuries before, when it 
had first appeared. “Runaway 
Planet.” “The Invader.” “Rejoice 
in Messias, the Day Is at Hand.” 
The labels were sense-free; they 
were Xs in an equation, signifying only that there was something there which was unknown. 
“The Runaway Planet” stopped 
running when it closed on Earth. 
“The Invader” didn’t invade; 
it merely sent down one slaggy, 
midnight-blue tetrahedron to 
Everest. 
And “Rejoice in Messias” stole 
Earth from its sun — with Earth’s 
old moon, which it converted into 
a miniature sun of its own. 
That was the time when men 
were plentiful and strong — or 
thought they were — with many 
huge cities and countless powerful 
machines. It didn’t matter. The 
new binary planet showed no interest in the cities or the machines. 
There was a plague of things 
like Eyes — dust-devils without 
dust, motionless air that suddenly tensed and quivered into lenticular shapes. They came with 
the planet and the Pyramid, so 
that there probably was some 
connection. But there was 
nothing to do about the Eyes. 
Striking at them was like striking at air — was the same thing, 
in fact. 
While the men and machines 
tried uselessly to do something 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
about it, the new binary system 
— the stranger planet and Earth — 
began to move, accelerating very 
slowly. 
But accelerating. 
In a week, astronomers knew 
something was happening. In a 
month, the Moon sprang into 
flame and became a new sun — 
beginning to be needed, for already the parent Sol was visibly 
more distant, and in a few years 
it was only one other star among 
many. 
Vl^HEN the little sun was 
” burned to a clinker, they — 
whoever “they” were, for men 
saw only the one Pyramid — 
would hang a new one in the sky. 
It happened every five clockyears, more or less. It was the 
same old moon-turned-sun, but 
it burned out, and the fires 
needed to be rekindled. 
The first of these suns had 
looked down on an Earthly population of ten billion. As the sequence of suns waxed and waned, 
there were changes, climatic fluctuation, all but immeasurable 
differences in the quantity and 
kind of radiation from the new 
source. 
The changes were such that 
the forty-fifth such sun looked 
down on a shrinking human race 
that could not muster up a hundred million. 
A frustrated man drives in
ward; it is the same with a race. 
The hundred million that clung 
to existence were not the same 
as the bold, vital ten billion. 
The thing on Everest had, in 
its time, received many labels, 
too: The Devil, The Friend, The 
Beast, A Pseudo-living Entity of 
Quite Unknown Electrochemical 
Properties. 
All these labels were also Xs. 
If it did wake that morning, 
it did not open its eyes, for it 
had no eyes — apart from the 
quivers of air that might or might 
not belong to it. Eyes might have 
been gouged; therefore it had 
none. So an illogical person might 
have argued — and yet it was 
tempting to apply the “purpose, 
not function” fallacy to it. Limbs 
could be crushed; it had no limbs. 
Ears could be deafened; it had 
none. Through a mouth, it might 
be poisoned; it had no mouth. Intentions and actions could be 
frustrated; apparently it had 
neither. 
It was there. That was all. 
It and others like it had stolen 
the Earth and the Earth did not 
know why. It was there. And the 
one thing on Earth you could not 
do was hurt it, influence it, or 
coerce it in any way whatever. 
It was there — and it, or the 
masters it represented, owned 
the Earth by right of theft. Utterly. Beyond human hope of 
challenge or redress. 
WOLFBANE 
IS 
II 
^ITIZEN and Citizeness Roget 
^ Germyn walked down Pine 
Street in the chill and dusk of — 
one hoped — a Sun Re-creation 
Morning. 
It was the convention to pretend that this was a morning like 
any other morning. It was not 
proper either to cast frequent 
hopeful glances at the sky, nor 
yet to seem disturbed or afraid 
because this was, after all, the 
forty-first such morning since 
those whose specialty was Sky 
Viewing had come to believe the 
Re-creation of the Sun was near. 
The Citizen and his Citizeness 
exchanged the assurance-of-identity sign with a few old friends 
and stopped to converse. This 
also was a convention of skill 
divorced from purpose. The conversation was without relevance 
to anything that any one of the 
participants might know, or think, 
or wish to ask. 
Germyn said for his friends 
a twenty-word poem he had made 
in honor of the occasion and 
heard their responses. They did 
line-capping for a while — until 
somebody indicated unhappiness 
and a wish to change by frowning the Two Grooves between his 
brows. The game was deftly 
ended with an improvised 
rhymed exchange. 
Casually, Citizen Germyn 
glanced aloft. The sky-change had 
not begun yet; the dying old Sun 
hung just over the horizon, east 
and south, much more south than 
east. It was an ugly thought, but 
suppose, thought Germyn, just 
suppose that the Sun were not 
re-created today? Or tomorrow. 
OrOr ever. 
The Citizen got a grip on himself and told his wife: “We shall 
dine at the oatmeal stall.” 
The Citizeness did not immediately reply. When Germyn 
glanced at her with well-masked 
surprise, he found her almost 
staring down the dim street at a 
Citizen who moved almost in a 
stride, almost swinging his arms. 
Scarcely graceful. 
“That might be more Wolf 
than man,” she said doubtfully. 
Germyn knew the fellow. Tropile was his name. One of those 
curious few who made their 
homes outside of Wheeling, 
though they were not farmers. 
Germyn had had banking dealings with him — or would have 
had, if it had been up to Tropile. 
“That is a careless man,” he 
decided, “and an ill-bred one.” 
They moved toward the oatmeal stall with the gait of Citizens, arms limp, feet scarcely 
lifted, slumped forward a little. 
It was the ancient gait of fifteen 
hundred calories per day, not one 
of which could be squandered. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
•^HERE was a need for more 
calories. So many for walking, 
so many for gathering food. So 
many for the economical pleasures of the Citizens, so many 
more — oh, many more, these 
days! — to keep out the cold. Yet 
there were no more calories; the 
diet the whole world lived on was 
a bare subsistence diet. 
It was impossible to farm well 
when half the world’s land was 
part of the time drowned in the 
rising sea, part of the time smothered in falling snow. 
Citizens knew this and, knowing, did not struggle — it was ungraceful to struggle, particularly 
when one could not win. Only — 
well, Wolves struggled, wasting 
calories, lacking grace. 
Citizen Germyn turned his 
mind to more pleasant things. 
He allowed himself his First 
Foretaste of the oatmeal. It 
would be warm in the bowl, hot 
in the throat, a comfort in the 
belly. There was a great deal of 
pleasure there, in weather like 
this, when the cold plucked 
through the loosened seams and 
the wind came up the sides of 
the hills. Not that there wasn’t 
pleasure in the cold itself, for 
that matter. It Was proper that 
one should be cold now, just before the re-creation of the Sun, 
when the old Sun was smokyred and the new one not yet 
kindled. 
still looks like Wolf to me,” 
his wife was muttering. 
“Cadence,” Germyn reproved 
his Citizeness, but took the sting 
out of it with a Quirked Smile. 
The man with the ugly manners was standing at the very bar 
of the oatmeal stall where they 
were heading. In the gloom of 
mid-morning, he was all angles 
and strained lines. His head was 
turned awkwardly on his shoulder, peering toward the back of 
the stall where the vendor was 
rhythmically measuring grain 
into a pot. His hands were resting helter-skelter on the counter, 
not hanging by his sides. 
Citizen Germyn felt a faint 
shudder from his wife. But he did 
not reprove her again, for who 
could blame her? The exhibition 
was revolting. 
She said faintly: “Citizen, 
might we dine on bread this 
morning?” 
He hesitated and glanced again 
at the ugly man. He said indulgently, knowing that he was indulgent: “On Sun Re-creation 
Morning, the Citizeness may dine 
on bread.” Bearing in mind the 
occasion, it was only a small favor 
and therefore a very proper one. 
The bread was good, very 
good. They shared out the halfkilo between them and ate it in 
silence, as it deserved. Germyn 
finished his first portion and, in 
the prescribed pause before be
WOLFBANE 
ginning his second, elected to refresh his eyes upward. 
He nodded to his wife and 
stepped outside. 
^VERHEAD, the Old Sun parceled out its last barrelscrapings of heat. It was larger 
than the stars around it, but many 
of them were nearly as bright. 
A high-pitched male voice 
said: “Citizen Germyn, good 
morning.” 
Germyn was caught off balance. He took his eyes off the 
sky, half turned, glanced at the 
face of the person who had 
spoken to him, raised his hand in 
the assurance-of-identity sign. It 
was all very quick and fluid — 
almost too quick, for he had had 
his fingers bent nearly into the 
sign for female friends and this 
was a man. Citizen Boyne. Germyn knew him well; they had 
shared the Ice Viewing at Niagara a year before. 
Germyn recovered quickly 
enough, but it had been disconcerting. 
He improvised swiftly: “There 
are stars, but are stars still there 
if there is no Sun?” It was a hurried effort, he grieved, but no 
doubt Boyne would pick it up 
and carry it along. Boyne had 
always been very good, very 
graceful. 
Boyne did no such thing. 
“Good morning,” he said again, 
faintly. He glanced at the stars 
overhead, as though trying to 
unravel what Germyn was talking about. He said accusingly, 
his voice cracking sharply: 
“There isn’t any Sun, Germyn. 
What do you think of that?” 
Germyn swallowed. “Citizen, 
perhaps you — ” 
“No Sun, you hear me!” the 
man sobbed. “It’s cold, Germyn. 
The Pyramids aren’t going to 
give us another Sun, do you 
know that? They’re going to 
starve us, freeze us; they’re 
through with us. We’re done, all 
of us!” He was nearly screaming. 
All up and down Pine Street, 
people were trying not to look 
at him and some of them were 
failing. 
Boyne clutched at Germyn 
helplessly. Revolted, Germyn 
drew back — bodily contact! 
It seemed to bring the man to 
his senses. Reason returned to 
his eyes. He said: “I — ” He 
stopped, stared about him. “I 
think I’ll have bread for breakfast,” he said foolishly, and 
plunged into the stall. 
Boyne left behind him a 
shaken Citizen, caught halfway 
into the wrist-flip of parting, staring after him with jaw slack and 
eyes wide, as though Germyn had 
no manners, either. 
All this on Sun Re-creation 
Day! 
What could it mean? Germyn 
GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
wondered fretfully, worriedly. 
Was Boyne on the point of — 
Could Boyne be about to — 
Germyn drew back from the 
thought. There was one thing that 
might explain Boyne’s behavior. 
But it was not a proper speculation for one Citizen to make 
about another. 
All the same — Germyn dared 
the thought — all the same, it 
did seem almost as though Citizen Boyne were on the point of 
— well, running amok. 
A T the oatmeal stall, Glenn 
Tropile thumped on the 
counter. The laggard oatmeal 
vendor finally brought the ritual 
bowl of salt and the pitcher of 
thin milk. Tropile took his paper 
twist of salt from the top of the 
neatly arranged pile in the bowl. 
He glanced at the vendor. His 
fingers hesitated. Then, quickly, 
he ripped the twist of paper into 
his oatmeal and covered it to the 
permitted level with the milk. 
He ate quickly and efficiently, 
watching the street outside. 
They were wandering and 
mooning about, as always — maybe today more than most days, 
since they hoped it would be the 
day the Sun blossomed flame 
once more. 
Tropile always thought of the 
wandering, mooning Citizens as 
they. There was a we somewhere 
for Tropile, no doubt, but Tro
pile had not as yet located it, not 
even in the bonds of the marriage contract. 
He was in no hurry. At the 
age of fourteen, Glenn Tropile 
had reluctantly come to realize 
certain things about himself — 
that he disliked being bested, 
that he had to have a certain 
advantage in all his dealings, or 
an intolerable itch of the mind 
drove him to discomfort. The 
things added up to a terrifying 
fear, gradually becoming knowledge, that the only we that 
could properly include him was 
one that it was not very wise to 
join. 
He had realized, in fact, that 
he was a Wolf. 
For some years, Tropile had 
struggled against it, for Wolf was 
an obscene word; the children he 
played with were punished 
severely for saying it, and for 
almost nothing else. 
It was not proper for one Citizen to advantage himself at the 
expense of another; Wolves did 
that. 
It was proper for a Citizen to 
accept what he had, not to strive 
for more, to find beauty in small 
things, to accommodate himself, 
with the minimum of strain and 
awkwardness, to whatever his life 
happened to be. 
Wolves were not like that. 
Wolves never meditated. Wolves 
never Appreciated, Wolves never 
WOLFBANE 
were Translated — that supreme 
fulfillment, granted only to those 
who succeeded in a perfect meditation, that surrender of the world 
and the flesh by taking leave of 
both, which could never be 
achieved by a Wolf. 
Accordingly, Glenn Tropile 
had tried very hard to do all the 
things that Wolves could not do. 
He had nearly succeeded. His 
specialty. Water Watching, had 
been most rewarding. He had 
achieved many partly successful 
meditations on Connectivity. 
And yet he was still a Wolf, 
for he still felt that burning, 
itching urge to triumph and to 
hold an advantage. For that 
reason, it was almost impossible 
for him to make friends among 
the Citizens; and gradually he 
had almost stopped trying. 
Tropile had arrived in Wheeling nearly a year before, making 
him one of the early settlers in 
point of time. And yet there was 
not a Citizen in the street who 
was prepared to exchange recognition gestures with him. 
He knew them, nearly every 
one. He knew their names and 
their wives’ names. He knew what 
northern states they had moved 
down from with the spreading of 
the ice, as the sun grew dim. He 
knew very nearly to the quarter 
of a gram what stores of sugar 
and salt and coffee each one of 
them had put away — for their 
guests, of course, not for themselves; the well-bred Citizen 
hoarded only for the entertainment of others. 
Tropile knew these things because there was an advantage in 
knowing them. But there was no 
advantage in having anyone 
know him. 
A few did — that banker, Germyn; Tropile had approached 
him only a few months before 
about a prospective loan. But it 
had been a chancy, nervous encounter. The idea was so luminously simple to Tropile— organize an expedition to the coal 
mines that once had flourished 
nearby, find the coal, bring it to 
Wheeling, heat the houses. And 
yet it had seemed blasphemous 
to Germyn. Tropile had counted 
himself lucky merely to have 
been refused the loan, instead of 
being cried out upon as Wolf. 
* ■'’HE oatmeal vendor was fussing worriedly around his neat 
stack of paper twists in the salt 
bowl. 
Tropile avoided the man’s eyes. 
Tropile was not interested in the 
little wry smile of self-deprecation which the vendor would 
make to him, given half a chance. 
Tropile knew well enough what 
was disturbing the vendor. Let 
it disturb him. It was Tropile’s 
custom to take extra twists of 
salt. They were in his pockets 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
now; they would stay there. Let 
the vendor wonder why he was 
short. 
Tropile licked the bowl of his 
spoon and stepped into the 
street. He was comfortably aware 
under a double-thick parka that 
the wind was blowing very cold. 
A Citizen passed him, walking 
alone: odd, thought Tropile. He 
was walking rapidly and there 
was a look of taut despair on his 
face. Still more odd. Odd enough 
to be worth another look, because that sort of haste, that sort 
of abstraction, suggested something to Tropile. They were in 
no way normal to the gentle 
sheep of the class They, except 
in one particular circumstance. 
Glenn Tropile crossed the 
street to follow the abstracted 
Citizen, whose name, he knew, 
was Boyne. The man blundered 
into Citizen Germyn outside the 
baker’s stall, and Tropile stood 
back out of easy sight, watching 
and listening. 
Boyne was on the ragged edge 
of breakdown. What Tropile 
heard and saw confirmed his 
diagnosis. The one particular circumstance was close to happening — Citizen Boyne was on the 
verge of running amok. 
Tropile looked at the man with 
amusement and contempt. Amok! 
The gentle sheep could be pushed 
too far. He had seen Citizens run 
amok, the signs were obvious. 
There was pretty sure to be an. 
advantage in it for Glenn Tropile. There was an advantage in 
almost anything, if you looked 
for it. 
He watched and waited. He 
picked his spot with care, so that 
he could see Citizen Boyne inside the baker’s stall, making a 
dismal botch of slashing his quarter-kilo of bread from the Morning Loaf. 
He waited for Boyne to come 
racing out . 
Boyne did. 
A yell — loud, piercing. It was 
Citizen Germyn, shrilling: “Amok, 
amok!” A scream. An enraged 
wordless cry from Boyne, and the 
baker’s knife glinting in the faint 
light as Boyne swung it. And then 
Citizens were scattering in every 
direction — all of the Citizens but 
one. 
One Citizen was under the 
knife— his own knife, as it happened; it was the baker himself. 
Boyne chopped and chopped 
again. And then Boyne came out, 
roaring, the broad knife whistling 
about his head. The gentle Citizens fled panicked before him. 
He struck at their retreating 
forms and screamed and struck 
again. Amok. 
It was the one particular circumstance when they forgot to 
be gracious— one of the two, Tropile corrected himself as he 
strolled across to the baker’s stall. 
WOLFBANE 
His brow furrowed, because there 
was another circumstance when 
they lacked grace, and one which 
affected him nearly. 
IXE watched the maddened 
creature, Boyne, already far 
down the road, chasing a knot 
of Citizenf around a corner. Tropile sighed and stepped into the 
baker’s stall to see what he might 
gain from this. 
Boyne would wear himself out 
—the surging rage would leave 
him as quickly as it came; he 
would be a sheep again and the 
other sheep would close in and 
capture him. That was what happened when a Citizen ran amok. 
It was a measure of what pressures were on the Citizens that, 
at any moment, there might be 
one gram of pressure too much 
and one of them would crack. It 
had happened here in Wheeling 
twice within the past two months. 
Glenn Tropile had seen it happen in Pittsburgh, Altoona and 
Bronxville. 
There is a limit to the pressure that can be endured. 
Tropile walked into the baker’s 
stall and looked down- without 
emotion at the slaughtered baker. 
The corpse was a gory mess, but 
Tropile had seen corpses before. 
He looked around the stall, calculating. As a starter, he bent to 
pick up the quarter-kilo of bread 
Boyne had dropped, dusted it off 
and slipped it into his pocket. 
Food was always useful. Given 
enough food, perhaps Boyne 
would not have run amok. 
Was it simple hunger they 
cracked under? Or the knowledge 
of the thing on Mount Everest, 
or the hovering Eyes, or the 
sought-after-dreaded prospect of 
Translation, or merely the strain 
of keeping up their laboriously 
figured lives? 
Did it matter? They cracked 
and ran amok, and Tropile never 
would, and that was what mattered. 
He leaned across the counter, 
reaching for what was left of the 
Morning L-oaf— 
And found himself staring into 
the terrified large eyes of Citizeness Germyn. 
She screamed: “Wolf! Citizens, 
help me! Wolf!” 
Tropile faltered. He hadn’t 
even seen the damned woman, 
but there she was, rising up from 
behind the counter, screaming her 
head off: “Wolf! Wolf!” 
He said sharply: “Citizeness, I 
beg you—” But that was no good. 
The evidence was on him and her 
screams would fetch others. 
Tropile panicked. He started 
toward her to silence her, but that 
was no good, either. He whirled. 
She was screaming, screaming, 
and there were people to hear. 
Tropile darted into the street, 
but they were popping out of 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
every doorway now, appearing 
from each rat’s hole in which they 
had hid to escape Boyne. 
“Please!” he cried, sobbing. 
“Wait a minute!” 
But they weren’t waiting. They 
had heard the woman and maybe 
some of them had seen him with 
the bread. They were all around 
him— no, they were all over him; 
they were clutching at him, tearing at his soft, warm furs. 
They pulled at his pockets and 
the stolen twists of salt spilled 
accusingly out. They yanked at 
his sleeves and even the stout, 
unweakened seams ripped open. 
He was fairly captured. 
“Wolf!” they were shouting. 
“Wolf!” It drowned out the distant noise from where Boyne had 
finally been run to earth, a block 
and more away. It drowned out 
everything. 
It was the other circumstance 
when they forgot to be gracious: 
when they had trapped a Son of 
the Wolf.

' I ■’HE forty-fifth small Sun shone 
on no engineers. 
Not even on the binary, perhaps. The Pyramids, the things 
on the binary, the thing on Mount 
Everest— they were not engineers. 
They employed a crude metaphysic based on dissection and 
shoving. 
They had no elegant field 
theories. All they knew was that 
everything came apart, and that 
if you pushed a thing, it would 
move. 
If your biggest push would 
not move a thing, you took it 
apart and pushed the parts, and 
then it would move. Sometimes, 
for nuclear effects, they had to 
take things apart into 3 x 10® 
pieces and shove each piece very 
carefully. 
By taking apart and shoving, 
then, they landed their one spaceship on the burned-out sunlet. 
Four human beings were on that 
ship. They meditated briefly on 
Connectivity and died screaming. 
A point of new flame appeared 
on the sunlet’s surface and the 
spaceship scrambled for the binary. The point of flame went 
from cherry through orange into 
the blue-white and began to 
spread. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
A T the moment of the Re-creation of the Sun, there was 
rejoicing on the Earth. 
Not quite everywhere, though. 
In Wheeling’s House of the 
Five Regulations, Glenn Tropile 
waited unquietly for death. Citizen Boyne, who had run amok 
and slaughtered the baker, shared 
Tropile’s room and his doom, but 
not his rage. Boyne, with demure 
pleasure, was composing his 
death poem. 
“Talk to me!” snapped Tropile. 
“Why are we here? What did 
you do and why did you do it? 
What have I done? Why don’t 
I pick up a bench and kill you 
with it? You would’ve killed me 
two hours ago if I’d caught your 
eye!” 
There was no satisfaction in 
Citizen Boyne; the passions were 
burned out of him. He politely 
tendered Tropile a famous aphorism: “Citizen, the art of living is 
the substitution of unimportant, 
answerable questions for important, unanswerable ones. Come, 
let us appreciate the new-born 
Sun.” 
He turned to the window, 
where the spark of blue-white 
flame in what had once been the 
crater of Tycho was beginning 
to spread across the charred 
moon. 
Tropile was child enough of 
his culture to turn with him, almost involuntarily. He was silent. 
That blue-white infinitesimal up, 
there growing slowly— the oneness, the calm rapture of Being 
in a universe that you shaded 
into without harsh discontinue, 
the being one with the great bluewhite gem-flower blossoming 
now in the heavens that were no 
different stuff than you yourself — 
He closed his eyes, calm, and 
meditated on Connectivity. 
He was being Good. 
By the time the fusion reaction 
had covered the whole small disk 
of the sunlet, a quarter-hour at 
the most, his meditation began 
to wear off. 
Tropile shrugged out of his 
torn parka, not bothering to rip 
it further. It was already growing warm in the room. Citizen 
Boyne, of course, was carefully 
opening every seam with graceful rending motions, miming 
great and smooth effort of the biceps and trapezius. 
But the meditation was over, 
and as Tropile watched his cellmate, he screamed a silent Why? 
Since his adolescence, that wailing syllable had seldom been far 
from his mind. It could be silenced by appreciation and meditation. 
Tropile’s specialty was Water 
Watching and he was so good at 
it that several beginners had 
asked him for instruction in the 
subtle art, in spite of his notorious 
WOLFBANE 
oddities of life and manner. He 
enjoyed Water Watching. He almost pitied anybody so singlemindedly devoted to, say, Clouds 
and Odors— great game though it 
was— that he had never even 
tried Water Watching. And after 
a session of Watching, when one 
was lucky enough to observe the 
Nine Boiling Stages in classic 
perfection, one might slip into 
meditation and be harmonious, 
feel Good. 
But what did one do when the 
meditations failed, as they had 
failed him? What did one do 
when they came farther and 
farther apart, became less and 
less intense, could be inspired, finally, only by a huge event like 
the renewal of the Sun? 
One went amok, he had always 
thought. 
But he had not. Boyne had. He 
had been declared a Son of the 
Wolf, on no evidence that he 
could understand. Yet he had 
not run amok. 
Still, the penalties were the 
same, he thought, uncomfortably 
aware of an unfamiliar itch— not 
the inward intolerable itch of 
needing the advantage, but a localized sensation at the base of 
his spine. The penalties for all 
gross crimes— Wolfhood or running amok— were the same, and 
simply this: 
They would perform the Lumbar Puncture. He would make 
the Donation of Spinal Fluid. 
He would be dead. 
^I^HE Keeper of the House of 
Five Regulations, an old man, 
Citizen Harmane, looked in on his 
charges— approvingly at Boyne, 
with a beclouded expression at 
Glenn Tropile. 
It was thought that even 
Wolves were entitled to the common human decencies in the 
brief interval between exposure 
and the Donation of Fluid. The 
Keeper would not have dreamed 
of scowling at the detected Wolf 
or of interfering with whatever 
wretched imitation of meditationbefore-dying the creature might 
practice. But he could not, all the 
same, bring himself to offer even 
an assurance-of-identity gesture. 
Tropile had no such qualms. 
He scowled at Keeper Harmane with such ferocity that the 
old man almost hurried away. He 
turned an almost equally ugly 
scowl upon Citizen Boyne. How 
dared that knife-murderer be so 
calm, so relaxed! 
Tropile said brutally: “They’ll 
kill us! You know that? They’ll 
stick a needle in our spines and 
drain us dry. It hurts. Do you 
understand me? They’re going 
to drain us, and then they’re going to drink our spinal fluid, and 
it’s going to hurt.” 
He was gently corrected. “We 
shall make the Donation,” Citizen 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
Boyne said calmly. “Is not the 
difference intelligible to a Son 
of the Wolf?” 
True culture demanded that 
that remark be accepted as a 
friendly joke, probably based on 
a truth— how else could an unpalatable truth be put in words? 
Otherwise the unthinkable might 
happen. They might quarrel. 
They might even come to blows! 
The appropriate mild smile 
formed on Tropile’s lips, but 
harshly he wiped it off. They 
were going to kill him. He would 
not smile for them! And the effort was enormous. 
“I’m not a Son of the Wolf!” 
he howled, desperate, knowing 
he was protesting to the man of 
all men in Wheeling who didn’t 
care, and who could do least 
about it if he did. “What’s this 
crazy talk about Wolves? I don’t 
know what a Son of the Wolf is 
and I don’t think you or anybody does. All I know is that I 
was acting sensibly. And everybody began howling! You’re supposed to know a Son of the Wolf 
by his unculture, his ignorance, 
his violence. But you chopped 
down three people and I only 
picked up a piece of bread! And 
I’m supposed to be the dangerous 
one!” 
“Wolves never know they’re 
Wolves,” sighed Citizen Boyne. 
“Fish probably think they’re 
birds and you evidently think 
you’re a Citizen. Would a Citi- * 
zen speak as you are speaking?” 
“But they’re going to kill us!” 
“Then why aren’t you composing your death poem?” 
G lenn Tropile took a deep 
breath. Something was biting 
him. It was bad enough that he 
was about to die, bad enough that 
he had done nothing worth dying for. But what was gnawing at 
him now had nothing to do with 
dying. 
The percentages were going 
the wrong way. This pale Citizen 
was getting an edge on him. 
An engorged gland in Tropile’s 
adrenals— it was only a pinhead 
in Citizen Boyne’s— gushed raw 
hormones into his bloodstream. 
He could die, yes— that was a 
skill everyone had to acquire, 
sooner or later. But while he was 
alive, he could not stand to be 
bested in an encounter, an argument, a relationship— not and stay 
alive. Wolf? Call him Wolf. Call 
him Operator, or Percentage 
Player; call him Sharp Article; 
call him Gamesman. 
If there was an advantage to be 
derived, he would derive it. It was 
the way he was put together. 
He said, for time: “You’re 
right. Stupid of me. I must have 
lost my head!” 
He thought. Some men think 
by poking problems apart; some 
think by laying facts side by side 
WOLFBANE 
to compare. Tropile’s thinking 
was neither of these, but a species of judo. He conceded to 
his opponent such things as 
Strength, Armor, Resource. He 
didn’t need these things for himself; to every contest, the opponent brought enough of them 
to supply two. It was Tropile’s 
habit (and Wolfish, he had to 
admit) to use the opponent’s 
strength against him, to break 
the opponent against his own 
steel walls. 
He thought. 
The first thing was to make up 
his mind: He was Wolf. Then let 
him be Wolf. He wouldn’t stay 
around for the spinal tap; he 
would go from there. But how? 
The second thing was to plan. 
There were obstacles. Citizen 
Boyne was one. The Keeper of 
the House of the Five Regulations was another. 
Where was the pole which 
would permit him to vault over 
these hurdles? There was always 
his wife. Gala. He owned her; 
she would do what he wished— 
provided he made her want to do 
it. 
Yes, Gala. He walked to the 
door and shouted to Citizen Harmane: “Keeper! I must see my 
wife! Have her brought to me!” 
It was impossible for the Keeper to refuse. He called gently, 
“I will invite the Citizeness,” and 
toddled away. 
The third thing was time. 
Tropile turned to Citizen 
Boyne. “Citizen,” he said persuasively, “since your death poem 
is ready and mine is not, will you 
be gracious enough to go first 
when they— when they come?” 
Citizen Boyne looked temperately at his cellmate and made 
the Quirked Smile. 
“You see?” he said. “Wolf.” 
And that was true. But what 
was also true was that Boyne 
couldn’t and didn’t refuse. 
IV 
¥TALF a world away, the midnight-blue Pyramid sat on 
its planed-off peak as it had sat 
since the days when Earth had 
a real sun of its own. 
It was of no importance to the 
Pyramid that Glenn Tropile was 
about to receive a slim catheter 
into his spine, to drain his saps 
and his life. It didn’t matter to 
the Pyramid that the pretext for 
the execution was an act which 
human history had long stopped 
considering a capital crime. Ritual sacrifice in any guise made no 
difference to the Pyramid. 
The Pyramid saw them come 
and the Pyramid saw them go— 
if the Pyramid could be said to 
“see.” One human being more or 
less, what matter? Who bothers 
to take a census of the cells in a 
hangnail? 
GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
And yet the Pyramid did have 
a kind of interest in Glenn Tropile. Or, at least, in the human 
race of which he was a part. 
Nobody knew much about the 
Pyramids, but everybody knew 
that much. They wanted something— else why would they have 
bothered to steal the Earth? 
The date of the theft was 2027. 
A great year— the year of the first 
landings on the Runaway Planet 
that had come blundering into the 
Solar System. Maybe those landings were a mistake — although 
they were a very great triumph, 
too; but maybe if it hadn’t been 
for the landings, the Runaway 
Planet might have run right 
through the ecliptic and away. 
However, the triumphal mistake was made and that was the 
first time a human eye saw a 
Pyramid. 
Shortly after— though not before a radio message was sent— 
that human eye winked out forever; but by then the damage 
was done. What passed in a Pyramid for “attention” had been attracted. The next thing that happened set the wireless channels 
between Palomar and Pernambuco, between Greenwich and the 
Cape of Good Hope, buzzing and 
worrying, as astronomers all over 
the Earth reported and confirmed 
and reconfirmed the astonishing 
fact that our planet was on the 
move. Rejoice in Messias had 
come to take us away. 
A world of ten billion people, 
some of them brilliant, many of 
them brave, built and flung the 
giant rockets of Operation Up at 
the invader; Nothing. 
The first, and only. Interplanetary Expeditionary Force was 
boosted up to no-gravity and 
dropped onto the new planet to 
strike back: Nothing. 
Earth moved spirally outward. 
If a battle could not be won, 
then perhaps a migration. New 
ships were built in haste. But they 
lay there rusting as the sun grew 
small and the ice grew thick, because where was there to go? Not 
Mars. Not the Moon, which was 
trailing alone. Not choking Venus 
or crushing Jupiter. 
The migration was defeated as 
surely as the war, there being 
no place to migrate to. 
One Pyramid came to Earth, 
only one. It shaved the crest off 
the highest mountain there was 
and squatted on it. An observer? 
A warden? Whatever it was, it 
stayed. 
The sun grew too distant to 
be of use, and out of the old 
Moon, the Pyramid aliens built 
a new small sun in the sky— a 
five-year sun that burned out and 
was replaced, again and again 
and endlessly again. 
It had been a fierce struggle 
against unbeatable odds on the 
part of the ten billion; and when 
WOLFBANE 
the uselessness of struggle was 
demonstrated at last, many of the 
ten billion froze to death, and 
many of them starved, and nearly all of the rest had something 
frozen or starved out of them; 
and what was left, two centuries 
and more later, was more or less 
like Citizen Boyne, except for a 
few— a very few— like Glenn Tropile. 
ALA Tropile stared miserably 
at her husband. “I want to 
get out of here,” he was saying 
urgently. “They mean to kill me. 
Gala, you know you can’t make 
yourself suffer by letting them 
kill me!” 
She wailed; “I can’t!” 
Tropile looked over his shoulder. Citizen Boyne was fingering 
the textured contrasts of a golden 
watch-case which had been his 
father’s— and soon would be his 
son’s. Boyne’s eyes were closed 
and he wasn’t listening. 
Tropile leaned forward and 
deliberately put his hand on his 
wife’s arm. She started and 
flushed, of course. 
“You can,” he said, “and what’s 
more, you will. You can help me 
get out of here. I insist on it. 
Gala, because I must save you 
that pain.” 
He took his hand off her arm, 
content. 
He said harshly: “Darling, 
don’t you think I know how much 
we’ve always meant to each 
other?” 
She looked at him wretchedly. 
Fretfully she tore at the billowing filmy sleeve of her summer 
blouse. The seams hadn’t been 
loosened; there had not been 
time. She had just been getting 
into the appropriate Sun Re-creation Day costume, to be worn 
under the parka, when the messenger had come with the news 
about her husband. 
She avoided his eyes. “If you’re 
really Wolf ...” 
Tropile’s sub-adrenals pulsed 
and filled him with confident 
strength. “You know what I am 
—you better than anyone else.” 
It was a sly reminder of their 
curious furtive behavior together; 
like the hand on her arm, it had 
its effect. “After all, why do we 
quarrel the way we did last 
night?” 
He hurried on; the job of the 
rowel was to spur her to action, 
not to inflame a wound. “Because we’re important to each 
other. I know that you would 
count on me to help if you were 
in trouble. And I know that you’d 
be hurt— deep/y. Gala!— if I didn’t 
count on you.” 
She sniffled and scuffed the 
bright strap over her open-toed 
sandal. 
Then she met his eyes. 
It was the after-effect of the 
argument, of course. Glenn Tro
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
pile knew just how heavily he 
could rely on the after-spiral of 
a quarrel. She was submitting. 
She glanced furtively at Citizen Boyne and lowered her voice. 
“What do I have to do?” she 
whispered. 
¥N five minutes, she was gone, 
^ but that was more than 
enough time. Tropile had at least 
thirty minutes left. They would 
take Boyne first; he had seen to 
that. And once Boyne was gone— 
Tropile wrenched a leg off his 
three-legged stool and sat precariously balanced on the other 
two. He tossed the loose leg clattering into a corner. 
The Keeper of the House of 
Five Regulations ambled slackbodied by and glanced into the 
room. “Wolf, what happened to 
your stool?” 
Tropile made a left-handed 
sign of no-importance. “It doesn’t 
matter. Except it is hard to meditate, sitting on this thing, with 
every muscle tensing and fighting against every other to keep 
my balance . .” 
The Keeper made an overruling sign of please-let-me-help. 
“It’s your last half-hour. Wolf,” 
he reminded Tropile. “I’ll fix the 
stool for you.” 
He entered and slammed and 
banged it together, and left with 
an expression of mild concern. 
Even a Son of the Wolf was en
titled to the fullest appreciation 
of that unique opportunity for 
meditation, the last half-hour before a Donation. 
In five minutes, the Keeper 
was back, looking solemn and yet 
glad, like a bearer of serious but 
welcome tidings. 
“It is the time for the first 
Donation,” he announced. “Which 
of you—” 
“Him,” said Tropile quickly, 
pointing. 
Boyne opened his eyes calmly 
and nodded. He got to his feet, 
made a formal leavetaking bow 
to Tropile, and followed the 
Keeper toward his Donation and 
his death. As they were going out, 
Tropile coughed a would-youplease-grant-me-a-favor cough. 
The Keeper paused. “What is 
it. Wolf?” 
Tropile showed him the empty 
water pitcher— empty, all right; 
he had emptied it out the window. 
“My apologies,” the Keeper 
said, flustered, and hurried Boyne 
along. He came back almost at 
once to fill the pitcher, even 
though he should be there to 
watch Boyne’s ceremonial Donation. 
Tropile stood looking at the 
Keeper, his sub-adrenals beginning to pound like the rolling boil 
of Well-aged Water. The Keeper 
was at a disadvantage. He had 
been neglectful of his charge— 
WOLFBANE 
a broken stool, no water in the 
pitcher. And a Citizen, brought 
up in a Citizen’s maze of consideration and tact, could not help 
but be humiliated, seeking to 
make amends. 
Tropile pressed his advantage 
home. “Wait,” he said to the 
Keeper. “I’d like to talk to you.” 
The Keeper hesitated, torn. 
“The Donation—” 
“Damn the Donation,” Tropile 
said calmly. “After all, what is 
it but sticking a pipe into a man’s 
backbone and sucking out the 
juice that keeps him alive? It’s 
killing, that’s all.” 
The Keeper turned literally 
white. Tropile was speaking blasphemy and he wasn’t stopping. 
“I want to tell you about my 
wife,” Tropile went on, assuming 
a confidential air. “Now there’s 
a real woman. Not one of these 
frozen-up Citizenesses, you know? 
Why, she and I used to—” He 
hesitated. “You’re a man of the 
world, aren’t you?” he demanded. 
“I mean you’ve seen life.” 
“I— suppose so,” the Keeper 
said faintly. 
“Then you won’t be shocked,” 
Tropile lied. “Well, let me tell 
you, there’s a lot to women that 
these stuffed-shirt Citizens don’t 
know about. Boy! Ever see a woman’s knee?” He sniggered. “Ever 
kiss a woman with—” he winked 
— ” with the li^ht on? Ever sit 
in a big armchair, say, with a 
woman in your Zap- all soft and 
heavy, and kind of warm, and 
slumped up against your chest, 
you know, and—” 
He stopped and swallowed. He 
was almost making himself 
retch, it was so hard to say these 
things. But he forced himself to 
go on: “Well, that’s what she and 
I used to do. Plenty. All the time. 
That’s what I call a real woman.” 
He stopped, warned by the 
Keeper’s sudden change of expression, glazed eyes, strangling 
breath. He had gone too far. He 
had only wanted to paralyze the 
man, revolt him, put him out of 
commission, but he was overdoing 
it. He jumped forward and 
caught the Keeper as he fell, 
fainting. 
I’T'^ROPILE callously emptied 
the water pitcher over the 
man. The Keeper sneezed and 
sat up groggily. He focused his 
eyes on Tropile and agonizedly 
blushed. 
Tropile said harshly: “I wish 
to see the new sun from the 
street.” 
The request was incredible. 
Even after the unbelievable obscenities he had heard, the Keeper was not prepared for this; he 
was staggered. Tropile was in detention regarding the Fifth Regulation. That was all there was to 
it. Such persons were not to be 
released from their quarters. The 
GALAXY SCIENCE FlCTtON 
WOLFBANE 
Keeper knew it, the world knew 
it, Tropile knew it. 
It was an obscenity even greater than the lurid tales of perverted lust, for Tropile had asked 
something which was impossible! 
No one ever asked anything that 
was impossible to grant, for no 
one could ever refuse anything. 
That was utterly graceless, unthinkable. 
One could only attempt to compromise. The Keeper stammeringly said: “May I— may I let you 
see the new sun from the corridor?” And even that was 
wretchedly wrong, but he had to 
offer something. One always offered something. The Keeper 
had never since babyhood given 
a flat no to anybody about anything. No Citizen had. A flat no 
led to anger, strong words— perhaps even hurt feelings. The only 
flat no conceivable was the enormous terminal no of an amok. 
Short of that — 
One offered. One split the difference. One was invariably filled 
with tepid pleasure when, invariably, the offer was accepted, 
the difference was split, both parties were satisfied. 
“That will do for a start,” Tropile snarled. “Open, man, open! 
Don’t make me wait.” 
The Keeper reeled and unlatched the door to the corridor. 
“Now the street!” 
“I can’t!” burst in an anguished 
cry from the Keeper. He buried 
his face in his hands and began 
to sob, hopelessly incapacitated. 
“The street!” Tropile said remorselessly. He himself felt 
wrenchingly ill; he was going 
against custom that had ruled his 
own life as surely as the Keeper’s. 
But he was Wolf. “I will be 
Wolf,” he growled, and advanced 
upon the Keeper. “My wife,” he 
said, “I didn’t finish telling you. 
Sometimes she used to put her 
arm around me and just snuggle 
up and— I remember one time 
she kissed my ear. Broad daylight. It felt funny and warm— I 
can’t describe it.” 
Whimpering, the Keeper flung 
the keys at Tropile and tottered 
brokenly away. 
He was out of the action. Tropile himself was nearly as badly 
off; the difference was that he. 
continued to function. The words 
coming from him had seared like 
acid in his throat. 
“They call me Wolf,” he said 
aloud, reeling against the wall. 
“I will be one.” 
He unlocked the outer door and 
his wife was waiting, holding in 
her arms the things he had asked 
her to bring. 
Tropile said strangely to her: 
“I am steel and fire. I am Wolf, 
full of the old moxie.” 
She wailed: “Glenn, are you 
sure I’m doing the right thing?” 
He laughed unsteadily and led 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
her by the arm through the deserted streets. 
V 
C ITIZEN Germyn, as was his 
right by position and status 
as a connoisseur, helped prepare 
Citizen Boyne for his Donation. 
There was nothing much to it— 
which made it an elaborate and 
lengthy task, according to the 
ethic of the Citizens; it had to 
be protracted, each step being 
surrounded by fullest dress of 
ritual. 
|t was done in the broad daylight of the new Sun, and as many 
of the three hundred citizens of 
Wheeling as could manage it 
were in the courtyard of the old 
Federal Building to watch. 
The nature of the ceremony 
was this: A man who revealed 
himself Wolf, or who finally 
crumbled under the demands of 
life and ran amok, could not be 
allowed to live. He was haled 
before an audience of his equals 
and permitted— with the help of 
regretful force, if that should be 
necessary, but preferably not— to 
make the Donation of Spinal 
Fluid. 
Execution was murder and 
murder was not permitted under 
the gentle code of Citizens; this 
was not execution. The draining 
of a man’s spinal fluid did not 
kill him. It only insured that. 
after a time and with much suffering, his internal chemistry 
would so arrange itself that it 
would continue to function, only 
not in a way that would sustain 
life. 
Once the Donation was made, 
the problem was completely altered, of course. Suffering was 
bad in itself. To save the Donor 
from the suffering that lay ahead, 
it was the custom to have the 
oldest and gentlest Citizen on 
hand stand by with a sharp-edged 
knife. When the Donation was 
complete, the Donor’s head was 
removed— purely to avert suffering. That was not execution, 
either, but only the hastening of 
an inevitable end. 
The dozen or so Citizens whose 
rank permitted them to assist 
then dissolved the spinal fluids 
in water and ceremoniously 
sipped them, at which time it 
was proper to offer a small poem 
in commentary. All in all, it 
was a perfectly splendid opportunity for the purest form of 
meditation for everyone concerned. 
Citizen Germyn, whose role 
was Catheter Bearer, took his 
place behind the Introducer Bearer, the Annunciators and the 
Questioner of Purpose. As he 
passed Citizen Boyne, Germyn 
assisted him to assume the proper 
crouched-over position. Boyne 
looked up gratefully and Ger
WOLFBANE 
myn found the occasion correct 
for a commendatory half-smile. 
The Questioner of Purpose 
said solemnly to Boyne: “It is 
your privilege to make a Donation here today. Do you wish to 
do so?” 
“I do,” said Boyne raptly. The 
anxiety had passed; clearly he 
was confident of making a good 
Donation. Germyn approved with 
all his heart. 
The Annunciators, in alternate 
stanzas, announced the right 
pause for meditation to the 
meager crowd, and all fell silent. 
Citizen Germyn began the process of blanking out his mind, to 
ready himself for the great opportunity to Appreciate that lay 
ahead. A sound distracted him; 
he glanced up irritably. It seemed 
to come from the House of the 
Five Regulations, a man’s voice, 
carrying. But no one else appeared to notice it. All of the 
watchers, all of those on the stone 
steps, were in somber meditation, 
Germyn tried to return his 
thoughts to where they belonged. 
But something was troubling 
him. He had caught a glimpse of 
the Donor and there had been 
something— something— 
He angrily permitted himself 
to look up once more to see just 
what it had been about Citizen 
Boyne that had attracted his attention. 
Yes, there was something. Over 
the form of Citizen Boyne, silent, 
barely visible, a flicker of life 
and motion. Nothing tangible. It 
was as if the air itself were in 
motion. 
It was, Germyn thought with a 
bursting heart— it was an Eye! 
The veritable miracle of Translation and it was about to take 
place here and now, upon the 
person of Citizen Boyne! And no 
one knew it but Germyn himself! 
TN this last surmise. Citizen 
Germyn was wrong. Or was 
he? True, no other human eyes 
saw the flawed-glass thing that 
twisted the air over Boyne’s prostrate body, but there was, in a 
sense, another witness . some 
thousands of miles away. 
The Pyramid on Mount Everest “stirred.” 
It did not move, but something about it moved, or changed, 
or radiated. The Pyramid surveyed its— cabbage patch? Wristwatch mine? As much sense, it 
may be, to say wristwatch patch 
or cabbage mine. At any rate, 
it surveyed what to it was a place 
where intricate mechanisms grew, 
ripened and were dug up at the 
moment of usefulness, whereupon 
they were quick-frozen and wired 
into circuits. 
Through signals perceptible to 
it, the Pyramids had become 
“aware” that one of its mecha
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
nisms was now ready to be 
plucked— harvested. 
The Pyramid’s blood was dielectric fluid. Its limbs were electrostatic charges. Its philosophy 
was: Unscrew It and Push. Its 
motive was survival. 
Survival today was not what survival once had been, for a Pyramid. 
Once survival had merely 
been gliding along on a cushion 
of repellent charges, streaming 
electrons behind for the push, 
sending h-f pulses out often 
enough to get a picture of their 
bounced return to integrate deep 
inside. 
If the picture showed something metabolizable, one metabolized it. One broke it down 
into molecules by lashing it with 
the surplus protons left over from 
the dispersed electrons; one adsorbed the molecules. Sometimes 
the metabolizable object was an 
Immobile and sometimes a Mobile— a vague, theoretical, frivolous classification to a philosophy 
whose basis was that everything 
unscrewed. If it was a Mobile, 
one sometimes had to move after 
it. 
That was the difference. 
The essential was survival, not 
making idle distinctions. And one 
small part of survival today was 
the Everest Pyramid’s job. 
It sat and waited. It sent out 
its h-f pulses bouncing and scat
tering, and it bounced and scattered them additionally on their 
return. Deep inside, the morethan - anamorphically distorted 
picture was reintegrated. Deeper 
inside, it was interpreted and 
evaluated for its part in survival, 
f I 'HERE was a need for certain 
mechanisms which grew on 
this planet. At irregular times, 
the Pyramid evaluated the picture to the effect that a mechanism— a wristwatch, so to speak 
—was ripe for plucking; and by 
electrostatic charges, it did so. 
The electrostatic charges, in 
forming, produced what humans 
called an Eye. But the Pyramid 
had no use for names. 
It merely plucked, when a 
mechanism was ripe. It had 
found that a mechanism was ripe 
now. 
A world away, before the ste|)s 
of Wheeling’s Federal Buildipg, 
electrostatic charges gathered 
above a component whose name 
was Citizen Boyne. There was 
a small sound like the clapping 
of two hands which made the 
three hundred citizens of Wheeling jerk upright out of their meditations. 
The sound was air filling the 
gap that had once been occupied 
by Citizen Boyne, who had instantly vanished— who had, in a 
word, been ripe and therefore 
been plucked. 
WOIFBANE 
VI 
G lenn Tropile and his sobbing wife passed the night 
in the stubble of a cornfield. 
Neither of them slept much. 
Tropile, numbed by contact 
with the iron chill of the field— 
it would be months before the 
new Sun warmed the Earth 
enough for it to begin radiating 
in turn— tossed restlessly, dreaming. He was Wolf. Let it be so, 
he told himself again and again. 
I will be Wolf. I will strike back 
at the Citizens. I will— 
Always the thought trailed 
off. He would exactly What? 
What could he do? 
Migration was an answer— go 
to another city. With Gala, he 
guessed. Start a new life, where 
he was not known as Wolf. 
And then what? Try to live a 
sheep’s life, as he had tried all 
his years? And there was the 
question of whether, in fact, he 
could manage to find a city where 
he was not known. The human 
race was migratory, in these 
years of subjection to the never 
quite understood rule of the 
Pyramids. 
It was a matter of insulation. 
When the new Sun was young, 
it was hot, and there was plenty 
of warmth; it was possible to 
spread north and south, away 
from final line of permafront 
which, in North America, came 
just above the old Mason-Dixon 
line. When the Sun was dying, 
the cold spread down. The race 
followed the seasons. Soon all of 
Wheeling would be spreading 
north again, and how was he to 
be sure that none of Wheeling’s 
Citizens might not turn up 
wherever he might go? 
He could be sure— that was the 
answer to that. 
All right, scratch migration. 
What remained? He could— with 
Gala, he guessed— live a solitary 
life on the fringes of cultivated 
land. They both had some skill 
at rummaging the old storehouses of the ancients, and there 
was still food and other commodities to be found. 
But even a Wolf is gregarious 
by nature and there were bleak 
hours in that night when Tropile 
found himself close to sobbing 
with his wife. 
At the first break of dawn, he 
was up. Gala had fallen into a 
light and restless sleep; he called 
her awake. 
“We have to move,” he said 
harshly. “Maybe they’ll get up 
enough guts to follow us. I don’t 
want them to find us.” 
Silently she got up. They 
rolled and tied the blankets she 
had bought; they ate quickly 
from the food she had brought; 
they made packs and put them 
on their shoulders and started 
to walk. One thing in their favor: 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
they were moving fast, faster 
than any Citizen was likely to 
follow. All the same, Tropile 
kept looking nervously behind 
him. 
They hurried north and east, 
and that was a mistake, because 
by noon they found themselves 
blocked by water. Once it had 
been a river; the melting of the 
polar ice caps that had submerged the coasts of the old continents had drowned it out and 
now it was salt water. But whatever it was, it was impassable. 
They would have to skirt it westward until they found a bridge 
or a boat. 
“We can stop and eat,” Tropile said grudgingly, trying not 
to despair. 
They slumped to the ground. It 
was warmer now. Tropile found 
himself getting drowsier, drowsier— 
He jerked erect and stared 
around belligerently. Beside him, 
his wife was lying motionless, 
though her eyes were open, gazing at the sky. Tropile sighed 
and stretched out. A moment’s 
rest, he promised himself, and 
then a quick bite to eat, and then 
onward . 
He was sound asleep when 
they spotted him. 
T here was a flutter of iron 
bird’s wings from overhead. 
Tropile jumped up out of his 
WOLFBANE 
sleep, awakening to panic. It was 
outside the possibility of belief, 
but there it was: 
In the sky over him, etched 
black against a cloud, a helicopter. And men staring out of it, 
staring down at him. 
A helicopter! 
But there were no helicopters, 
or none that flew— if there had 
been fuel to fly them with— if 
any man had had the skill to 
make them fly. It was impossible! 
And yet there it was, and the 
men were looking at him, and 
the impossible great whirling 
thing was coming down, nearer. 
He began to run in the downward wash of air from the vanes. 
But it was no use. There were 
three men and they were fresh 
and he wasn’t. He stopped, dropping into the fighter’s crouch 
that is pre-set into the human 
body, ready to do battle. 
The men didn’t want to fight. 
They laughed and one of them 
said amiably: “Long past your 
bedtime, boy. Get in. We’ll take 
you home.” 
Tropile stood poised, hands 
half-clenched. “Take—” 
“Take you home. Yeah. Where 
you belong, Tropile. Not back to 
Wheeling, if that’s what is worrying you.” 
“Where I-” 
“Where you belong.” 
Then Tropile understood. 
He got into the helicopter won
39 
deringly. Home. So there was a 
home for such as he. He wasn’t 
alone. He needn’t keep his solitary self apart. He could be with 
his own kind. 
He remembered Gala Tropile 
and paused. One of the men said 
with quick understanding: “Your 
wife? I think we saw her about 
half a mile from here. Heading 
back to Wheeling as fast as she 
could go.” 
Tropile nodded. That was better, after all. Gala was no Wolf, 
though he had tried his best to 
make her one. 
One of the men closed the 
door; another did something 
with levers and wheels; the vanes 
whooshed around overhead; the 
helicopter bounced on its stiffsprung landing legs and then 
rocked up and away. 
For the first time in his life, 
Glenn Tropile looked down on 
the land. 
They didn’t fly high — but 
Glenn Tropile had never flown 
at all, and the two or three hundred feet of air beneath made 
him faint and queasy. They 
danced through the passes in the 
West Virginia hills, crossed icy 
streams and rivers, swung past 
old empty towns which no longer 
even had names of their own. 
They saw no one. 
It was something over four 
hundred miles to where they 
were going, one of the men told 
him. They made it easily before 
dark. 
A S Tropile walked through the 
town in the evening light, 
electricity flared white and violet 
in the buildings around him. 
Imagine! Electricity was calories, 
and calories were to be hoarded. 
There were other walkers in 
the street. Their gait was not 
the economical shuffle with pendant arms. They burned energy 
visibly. They swung. They 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
WOLFBANE 
strode. It had been chiseled on 
his brain in earliest childhood 
that such walking was wrong, 
reprehensible, debilitating. It 
wasted calories. These people did 
not look debilitated and they 
didn’t seem to mind wasting 
calories. 
It was an ordinary sort of 
town, apparently named Princeton. It did not have the transient 
look to it of, say. Wheeling, or 
Altoona, or Gary, in Tropile’s experience. It looked like — well, 
it looked permanent. 
Tropile had heard of a town 
called Princeton, but it happened 
that he had never passed through 
it southwarding or northbound. 
There was no reason why he or 
anybody should or should not 
have. Still, there was a possibility, once he thought of it, that 
things were somehow so arranged 
that they should not; maybe it 
was all on purpose. Like every 
town, it was underpopulated, but 
not so much so as most. Perhaps 
one living space in five was used. 
A high ratio. 
The man beside him was 
named Haendl, one of the men 
from the helicopter. They hadn’t 
talked much on the flight and 
they didn’t talk much now. “Eat 
first,” Haendl said, and took Tropile to a bright and busy sort of 
food stall. Only it wasn’t a stall. 
It was a restaurant. 
This Haendl — what to make 
of him? He should have been disgusting, nasty, an abomination. 
He had no manners whatever. 
He didn’t know, or at least didn’t 
use, the Seventeen Conventional 
Gestures. He wouldn’t let Tropile walk behind him and to his 
left, though he was easily five 
years Tropile’s senior. When he 
ate, he ate. The Sip of Appreciation, the Pause of First Surfeit, 
the Thrice Proffered Share meant 
nothing to him. He laughed when 
Tropile tried to give him the 
Elder’s Portion. 
Cheerfully patronizing, this 
man Haendl said to Tropile; 
“That stuff’s all right when you 
don’t have anything better to 
do with your time. Those poor 
mutts don’t. They’d die of boredom without their inky-pinky 
cults and they don’t have the 
resources to do anything bigger. 
Yes, I do know the Gestures. 
Seventeen delicate ways of communicating emotions too refined 
for words. The hell with them, 
Tropile. I’ve got words. You’ll 
learn them, too.” 
Tropile ate silently, trying to 
think. 
A man arrived, threw himself 
in a chair, glanced curiously at 
Tropile and said: “Haendl, the 
Somerville Road. The creek 
backed up when it froze. Flooded 
bad. Ruined everything.” 
Tropile ventured: “The flood 
ruined the road?” 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
“The road? No. Say, you must 
be the fellow Haendl went after. 
Tropile, that the name?” He 
leaned across the table, pumped 
Tropile’s hand. “We had the road 
nicely blocked,” he explained. 
“The flood washed it clean. Now 
we have to block it again.” 
Haendl said: “Take the tractor if you need it.” 
The man nodded and left. 
Haendl said: “Eat up. We’re 
wasting time. About that road— 
we keep all entrances blocked up, 
see? Why let a lot of sheep in 
and out?” 
“Sheep?” 
“The opposite,” said Haendl, 
“of Wolves.” 
^ I ^ AKE ten billion people and 
say that, out of every million of them, one— just one— is 
different. He has a talent for survival; call him Wolf. Ten thousand of him in a world of ten 
billion. 
Squeeze them, freeze them, 
cut them down. Let old Rejoice 
in Messias loom in the terrifying sky and so abduct the Earth 
that the human race is decimated, fractionated, reduced to 
what is in comparison a bare 
handful of chilled, stunned survivors. There aren’t ten billion 
people in the world any more. 
No, not by a factor of a thousand. 
Maybe there are as many as 
ten million, more or less, rattling 
around in the space their enormous Elder Generations made 
for them. 
And of these ten million, how 
many are Wolf? 
Ten thousand. 
“You understand, Tropile?” 
said Haendl. “We survive. I don’t 
care what you call us. The sheep 
call us Wolves. Me, I kind of call 
us Supermen. We have a talent for 
survival.” 
Tropile nodded, beginning to 
understand. “The way I survived 
the House of the Five Regulations.” 
Haendl gave him a pitying 
look. “The way you survived 
thirty years of Sheephood before 
that. Come on.” 
It was a tour of inspection. 
They went into a building, big, 
looking like any other big and 
useful building of the ancients, 
gray stone walls, windows with 
ragged spears of glass. Inside, 
though, it wasn’t like the others. 
Two sub-basements down, Tropile winced and turned away 
from the flood of violet light that 
poured out of a quartz bull’s-eye 
on top of a squat steel cone. 
“Perfectly harmless, Tropile— 
you don’t have to worry,” Haendl 
boomed. “Know what you’re looking at? There’s a fusion reactor 
down there. Heat. Power. All the 
power we need. Do you know 
what that means?” 
He stared soberly down at the 
WOLFBANE 
flaring violet light of the inspection port. 
“Come on,” he said abruptly 
to Tropile. 
Another building, also big, also 
gray stone. A cracked inscription 
over the entrance read: ORIAL 
HALL OF HUMANITIES. The 
sense-shock this time was not 
light; it was sound. Hammering, 
screeching, rattling, rumbling. 
Men were doing noisy things with 
metal and machines. 
“Repair shop!” Haendl yelled. 
“See those machines? They belong to our man Innison. We’ve 
salvaged them from every big 
factory ruin we could find. Give 
Innison a piece of metal— any alloy, any shape— and one of those 
machines will change it into any 
other shape and damned near 
any other alloy. Drill it, cut it, 
plane it, weld it, smelt it, zonemelt it, bond it— you tell him 
what to do and he’ll do it. 
“We got the parts to make six 
tractors and forty-one cars out 
of this shop. And we’ve got other 
shops— aircraft in Farmingdale 
and Wichita, armaments in Wilmington. Not that we can’t make 
some armaments here. Innison 
could build you a tank if he had 
to, complete with 105-millimeter 
gun.” 
“What’s a tank?” Tropile 
asked. 
Haendl only looked at him and 
said: “Come on!” 
G lenn Tropile’s head spun 
dizzily and all the spectacles 
merged and danced in his mind. 
They were incredible. All of 
them. 
Fusion pile, machine shop, 
vehicular garage, aircraft hangar. 
There was a storeroom under the 
seats of a football stadium, and 
Tropile’s head spun on his shoulders again as he tried to count 
the cases of coffee and canned 
soups and whiskey and beans. 
There was another storeroom, 
only this one was called an 
armory. It was filled with . 
guns. Guns that could be loaded 
with cartridges, of which they 
had very many; guns which, 
when you loaded them and 
pulled the trigger, would fire. 
Tropile said, remembering: “I 
saw a gun once that still had its 
firing pin. But it was rusted 
solid.” 
“These work, Tropile,” said 
Haendl. “You can kill a man 
with them. Some of us have.” 
“Kill-” 
“Get that sheep look out of 
your eyes, Tropile! What’s the 
difference how you execute a 
criminal? And what’s a criminal 
but someone who represents a 
danger to your world? We prefer 
a gun instead of the Donation 
of the Spinal Tap, because it’s 
quicker, because it’s less messy 
—and because we don’t like to 
drink spinal fluid, no matter what 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
imaginary therapeutic or symbolic value it has. You’ll learn.” 
But he didn’t add “come on.” 
They had arrived where they 
were going. 
It was a small room in the 
building that housed the armory 
and it held, among other things, 
a rack of guns. 
“Sit down,” said Haendl, taking one of the guns out of the 
rack thoughtfully and handling 
it as the doomed Boyne had 
caressed his watch-case. It was 
the latest pre-Pyramid-model 
rifle, anti-personnel, short-range. 
It would not scatter a cluster of 
shots in a coffee can at more than 
two and a half miles. 
“All right,” said Haendl, stroking the stock. “You’ve seen the 
works, Tropile. You’ve lived thirty years with sheep. You’ve seen 
what they have and what we 
have. I don’t have to ask you to 
make a choice. I know what you 
choose. The only thing left is 
to tell you what we want from 
you.” 
A faint pulsing began inside 
Glenn Tropile. “I expected we’d 
be getting to that.” 
“Why not? We’re not sheep. 
We don’t act that way. Quid pro 
quo. Remember that — it saves 
time. You’ve seen the quid. Now 
we come to the quo.” He leaned 
forward. “Tropile, what do you 
know about the Pyramids?” 
“Nothing.” 
Haendl nodded. “Right. They’re 
all around us and our lives are 
beggared because of them. And 
we don’t even know why. We 
don’t have the least idea of what 
they are. Did you know that one 
of the sheep was Translated in 
Wheeling when you left?” 
“Translated?” 
Tropile listened with his 
mouth open while Haendl told 
him about what had happened to 
Citizen Boyne. 
“So he didn’t make the Donation after all,” Tropile said. 
“Might have been better if 
he had,” said Haendl. “Still, it 
gave you a chance to get away. 
We had heard— never mind how 
just yet— that Wheeling’d caught 
itself a Wolf, so we came looking 
for you. But you were already 
gone.” 
T ropile said, faintly annoyed: “You were damn near 
too late.” 
“Oh, no, Tropile,” Haendl assured him. “We’re never too 
late. If you don’t have enough 
guts and ingenuity to get away 
from sheep, you’re no wolfsimple as that. But there’s this 
Translation. We know it happens, 
but we don’t even know what it 
is. All we know, people disappear. 
There’s a new sun in the sky 
every five years or so. Who 
makes it? The Pyramids. How? 
We don’t know that. Sometimes 
WOLFBANE 
something floats around in the 
air and we call it an Eye. It has 
something to do with Translation, 
something to do with the Pyramids. What? We don’t know 
that.” 
“We don’t know much of anything,” interrupted Tropile, trying to hurry him along. 
“Not about the Pyramids, no.” 
Haendl shook his head. “Hardly 
anyone has ever' seen one, for 
that matter.” 
“Hardly — You mean you 
have?” 
“Oh, yes. There’s a Pyramid 
on Mount Everest, you know. 
That’s not just a story. It’s true. 
I’ve been there, and it’s there. At 
least, it was there five years ago, 
right after the last Sun Re-creation. I guess it hasn’t moved. It 
just sits there.” 
Tropile listened, marveling. To 
have seen a real Pyramid! Almost he had thought of them as 
legends, contrived to account for 
such established physical facts as 
the Eyes and Translation, as 
children with a Santa Claus. But 
this incredible man had seen it! 
“Somebody dropped an Hbomb on it, way back,” Haendl 
continued, “and the only thing 
that happened is that now the 
North Col is a crater. You can’t 
move the Pyramid. You can’t 
hurt it. But it’s alive. It has been 
there, alive, for a couple of hundred years; and that’s about all 
we know about the Pyramids. 
Right?” 
“Right.” 
Haendl stood up. “Tropile, 
that’s what all of this is all 
about!” He gestured around him. 
“Guns, tanks, airplanes— we want 
to know more! We’re going to 
find out more and then we’re going to fight.” 
There was a jarring note and 
Tropile caught at it, sniffing the 
air. Somehow — perhaps it was his 
sub-adrenals that told him— this 
very positive, very self-willed 
man was just the slightest bit 
unsure of himself. But Haendl 
swept on and Tropile, for a moment, forgot to be alert. 
“We had a party up Mount 
Everest five years ago,” Haendl 
was saying. “We didn’t find out 
a thing. Five years before that, 
and five years before that— every 
time there’s a sun, while it is 
still warm enough to give a party 
a chance to climb up the sides 
—we send a team up there. It’s 
a rough job. We give it to the 
new boys, Tropile. Like you.” 
There it was. He was being invited to attack a Pyramid. 
Tropile hesitated, delicately 
balanced, trying to get the fee/ 
of this negotiation. This was Wolf 
against Wolf; it was hard. There 
had to be an advantage— 
“There is an advantage,” 
Haendl said aloud. 
Tropile jumped, but then he 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
remembered: Wolf against Wolf. 
Haendl went on: “What yoi' 
get out of it is your life, in the 
first place. You understand you 
can’t get out now. We don’t 
want sheep meddling around. 
And in the second place, there’s 
a considerable hope of gain.” He 
stared at Tropile with a dreamer’s eyes. “We don’t send parties up there for nothing, you 
know. We want to get something 
out of it. What we want is the 
Earth.” 
“The Earth?” It reeked of 
madness. But this man wasn’t 
mad. 
“Some day, Tropile, it’s going 
to be us against them. Never 
mind the sheep — they don’t 
count. It’s going to be Pyramids 
and Wolves, and the Pyramids 
won’t win. And then—” 
It was enough to curdle the 
blood. This man was proposing 
to fiiht, and against the invulnerable, the godlike Pyramids. 
But he was glowing and the 
fever was contagious. Tropile 
felt his own blood begin to pound. 
Haendl hadn’t finished his “and 
then—” but he didn’t have to. 
The “and then” was obvious : 
And then the world takes up 
again from the day the wandering planet first came into view. 
And then we go back to our own 
solar system and an end to the 
five-year cycle of frost and hunger. 
And then the Wolves can rule 
a world worth ruling. , 
It was a meretricious appeal, 
perhaps, but it could not be refused. Tropile was lost. 
He said: “You can put away 
the gun, Haendl. You’ve signed 
me up.” 
VII 
T he way to Mount Everest, 
Tropile glumly found, lay 
through supervising the colony’s 
nursery school. It wasn’t what he 
had expected, but it had the advantages that while his charges 
were learning, he was learning, 
too. 
One jump ahead of the threeyear-olds, he found that the 
“wolves,” far from being predators on the “sheep,” existed with 
them in a far more complicated 
ecological relationship. There 
were Wolves all through sheepdom; they leavened the dough 
of society. 
In barbarously simple prose, 
a primer said: “The Sons of the 
Wolf are good at numbers and 
money. You and your friends 
play money games almost as 
soon as you can talk, and you 
can think in percentages and 
compound interest when you 
want to. Most people are not able 
to do this.” 
True, thought Tropile subvocally, reading aloud to the tots. 
WOLFBANE 
That was how it had been with 
him. 
“Sheep are afraid of the Sons 
of the Wolf. Those of us who live 
among them are in constant danger of detection and death— although ordinarily a Wolf can take 
care of himself against any number of sheep.” True, too. 
“It is one of the most dangerous assignments a Wolf can 
be given to live among the sheep. 
Yet it is essential. Without us, 
they would die— of stagnation, of 
rot, eventually of hunger.” 
It didn’t have to be spelled out 
any further. Sheep can’t mend 
their own fences. 
The prose was horrifyingly 
bald and the children were horrifyingly— he choked on the word, 
but managed to form it in his 
mind — competitive. The verbal 
taboos lingered, he found, after 
he had broken through the barriers of behavior. 
But it was distressing, in a 
way. At an age when future Citizens would have been learning 
their Little Pitcher Ways, these 
children were learning to fight. 
The perennial argument about 
who would get to be Big Bill 
Zeckendorf when they played a 
strange game called “Zeckendorf 
and Hilton” sometimes ended in 
bloody noses. 
And nobody— nobody at allmeditated on Connectivity. 
Tropile was warned not to do 
it himself. Haendl said grimly: 
“We don’t understand it and we 
don’t like what we don’t understand. We’re suspicious animals, 
Tropile. As the children grow 
older, we give them just enough 
practice so they can go into one 
meditation and get the feel of 
it— or pretend to, at any rate. 
If they have to pass as Citizens, 
they’ll need that much. But more 
than that we do not allow.” 
“Allow?” Somehow the word 
grated; somehow his sub-adrenals 
began to pulse. 
“Allow! We have our suspicions 
and we know for a fact that 
sometimes people disappear when 
they meditate. We don’t want to 
disappear. We think it’s not a 
good thing to disappear. Don’t 
meditate, Tropile. You hear?” 
B ut later, Tropile had to 
argue the point. He picked 
a time when Haendl was free, or 
as nearly free as that man ever 
was. The whole adult colony 
had been out on what they used 
as a parade ground— it had once 
been a football field, Haendl said. 
They had done their regular 
twice-a-week infantry drill, that 
being one of the prices one paid 
for living among the free, progressive Wolves instead of the 
dull and tepid sheep. 
Tropile was mightily winded, 
but he cast himself on the ground 
near Haendl, caught his breath 
4B 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
and said: “Haendl— about meditation.” 
“What about it?” 
“Well, perhaps you don’t really grasp it.” 
Tropile searched for words. He 
knew what he wanted to say. 
How could anything that felt as 
good as Oneness be bad? And 
wasn’t Translation, after all, so 
rare as hardly to matter? But 
he wasn’t sure he could get 
through to Haendl in those 
terms. 
He tried: “When you meditate 
successfully, Haendl, you’re one 
with the Universe. Do you know 
what I mean? There’s no feeling 
like it. It’s indescribable peace, 
beauty, harmony, repose.” 
“It’s the world’s cheapest narcotic,” Haendl snorted. 
“Oh, now, really—” 
“And the world’s cheapest religion. The stone-broke mutts 
can’t afford gilded idols, so they 
use their own navels. That’s all 
it is. They can’t afford alcohol; 
they can’t even afford the muscular exertion of deep breathing 
that would throw them into a 
state of hyperventilated oxygen 
drunkenness. Then what’s left? 
Self-hypnosis. Nothing else. It’s 
all they can do, so they learn it, 
they define it as pleasant and 
good, and they’re all fixed up.” 
Tropile sighed. The man was 
so stubborn! Then a thought occurred to him and he pu hed him
self up on his elbows. “Aren’t you 
leaving something out? What 
about Translation?” 
Haendl glowered at him. 
“That’s the part we don’t understand.” 
“But surely self - hypnosis 
doesn’t account for—” 
“Surely it doesn’t!” Haendl 
mimicked savagely. “All right. 
We don’t understand it and we’re 
afraid of it. Kindly do not tell 
me Translation is the supreme 
act of Un-willing, Total Disavowal of Duality, Unison with 
the Brahm-Ground or any such 
slop. You don’t know what it is 
and neither do we.” He started 
to get up. “All we know is, people vanish. And we want no part 
of it, so we don’t meditate. None 
of us— including you!” 
T T was foolishness, this closeorder drill. Could you defeat the unreachable Himalayan 
Pyramid with a squads-right 
flanking maneuver? 
And yet it wasn’t all foolishness. Close-order drill and 2500calorie-a-day diet began to put 
fat and flesh and muscle on Tropile’s body, and something other 
than that on his mind. He had 
not lost the edge of his acquisitiveness, his drive— his whatever 
it was that made the difference 
between Wolf and sheep. 
But he had gained something. 
Happiness? Well, if “happiness” 
WOLFBANE 
is a sense of purpose, and a hope 
that the purpose can be accomplished, then happiness. It was 
a feeling that had never existed 
in his life before. Always it had 
been the glandular compulsion 
to gain an advantage, and that 
was gone, or anyway almost gone, 
because it was permitted in the 
society in which he now lived. 
Glenn Tropile sang as he puttputted in his tractor, plowing the 
thawing Jersey fields. Still, a 
faint doubt remained. Squads 
right against the Pyramids? 
Stiffly, Tropile stopped the 
tractor, slowed the diesel to a 
steady thrum and got off. It was 
hot— being midsummer of the 
five-year calendar the Pyramids 
had imposed. It was time for 
rest and maybe something to eat. 
He sat in the shade of a tree, 
as farmers always have done, and 
opened his sandwiches. He was 
only a mile or so from Princeton, 
but he might as well have been 
in Limbo; there was no sign of 
any living human but himself. 
The northering sheep didn’t 
come near Princeton — it “happened” that way, on purpose. 
He caught a glimpse of something moving, but when he stood 
up for a better look into the 
woods on the other side of the 
Held, it was gone. Wolf? Real 
Wolf, that is? It could have been 
a bear, for that matter— there 
was talk of wolves and bears 
around Princeton; and although 
Tropile knew that much of the 
talk was assiduously encouraged 
by men like Haendl, he also 
knew that some of it was true. 
As long as he was up, he gathered straw from the litter of last 
“year’s” head-high grass, gathered sticks under the trees, built 
a small fire and put water on to 
boil for coffee. Then he sat back 
and ate his sandwiches, thinking 
Maybe it was a promotion, going from the nursery school to 
labor in the fields. Or maybe it 
wasn’t. Haendl had promised him 
a place in the expedition that 
would — maybe — discover something new and great and helpful 
about the Pyramids. And that 
might still come to pass, because 
the expedition was far from 
ready to leave. 
Tropile munched his sandwiches thoughtfully. Now why 
was the expedition so far from 
ready to leave? It was absolutely 
essential to get there in the 
warmest weather possible— otherwise Mt. Everest was unclimbable. Generations of alpinists had 
proved that. That warmest 
weather was rapidly going by. 
And why were Haendl and the 
Wolf colony so insistent on 
building tanks, arming themselves with rifles, organizing in 
companies and squads? The Hbomb hadn’t flustered the Pyramid. What lesser weapon could? 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
Uneasily, Tropile put a few 
more sticks on the fire, staring 
thoughtfully into the canteen cup 
of water. It was a satisfyingly 
hot fire, he noticed abstractedly. 
The water was very nearly ready 
to boil. 
TTALF across the world, the 
Pyramid in the Himalays 
felt, or heard, or tasted— a difference. 
Possibly the h-f pulses that 
had gone endlessly wheep, wheep, 
wheep were now going wheepbeep, wheep-foeep. Possibly the 
electromagnetic “taste” of lowerthan-red was now spiced with a 
tang of beyond-violet. Whatever 
the sign was, the Pyramid recognized it. 
A part of the crop it tended 
was ready to harvest. 
The ripening bud had a name, 
of course, but names didn’t matter to the Pyramid. The man 
named Tropile didn’t know he 
was ripening, either. All that Tropile knew was that, for the first 
time in nearly a year, he had 
succeeded in catching each stage 
of the nine perfect states of 
water-coming-to-a-boil in its purest form. 
It was like . like . well, 
it was like nothing that anyone 
but a Water Watcher could understand. He observed. He appreciated. He encompassed and 
absorbed the myriad subtle per
fections of time, of shifting transparency, of sound, of distribution of ebulliency, of the fainl^ 
faint odor of steam. 
Complete, Glenn Tropile relaxed all his limbs and let his 
chin rest on his breast-bone. 
It was, he thought with placid, 
crystalline perception, a rare and 
perfect opportunity for meditation. He thought of Connectivity. 
(Overhead, a shifting glassy flaw 
appeared in the thin, still air.) 
There wasn’t any thought of 
Eyes in the erased palimpsest 
that was Glenn Tropile’s mind. 
There wasn’t any thought of 
Pyramids or of Wolves. The 
plowed field before him didn’t 
exist. Even the water, merrily 
bubbling itself dry, was gone 
from his perception. 
He was beginning to meditate. 
Time passed— or stood still— 
for Tropile; there was no difference. There was no time. He 
found himself almost on the 
brink of Understanding. 
Something snapped. An intruding blue-bottle drone, maybe, or 
a twitching muscle. Partly, Tropile came back to reality. Almost, he glanced upward. Almost, 
he saw the Eye . 
It didn’t matter. The thing that 
really mattered, the only thing 
in the world, was all within his 
mind; and he was ready, he knew, 
to find it. 
WOLFBANE 
Once more! Try harder! 
He let the mind-clearing unanswerable question drift into 
his mind: 
If the sound of two hands together is a clapping, what is the 
sound of one hand? 
Gently he pawed at the question, the symbol of the futility of 
mind— and therefore the gateway 
to meditation. Unawareness of 
self was stealing deliciously over 
him. 
He was Glenn Tropile. He was 
more than that. He was the water 
boiling . and the boiling water 
was he. He was the gentle 
warmth of the fire, which was— 
which was, yes, itself the arc of 
the sky. As each thing was each 
other thing; water was fire, and 
fire air; Tropile was the first simmering bubble and the full roll of 
Well-aged Water was Self, was— 
more than Self— was— 
The answer to the unanswerable question was coming clearer 
and softer to him. And then, all 
at once, but not suddenly, for 
there was no time, it was not 
close— it was. 
The answer was his, was him. 
The arc of sky was the answer, 
and the answer belonged to sky 
—to warmth, to all warmths that 
there are, and to all waters, and 
—and the answer was — was — 
Tropile vanished. The mild 
thunderclap that followed made 
the flames dance and the column 
of steam fray; and then the fire 
was steady again, and so was the 
rising steam. But Tropile was 
gone.

chance to abate, she stormed over 
to the videocom and punched the 
number for Housing. 
“Expediter’s office.” The receptionist’s voice came through buoyantly, even before her image 
formed on the screen. “Good 
morn — ” 
“It is not a good morning!” 
Cherry said, her red hair swirling 
as she shook her head emphatically. 
“First,” she thrust up a rigid 
finger to enumerate the point, 
“there are no mornings here. 
“Second,” another finger indicated, “none of them would be 
good with a gale blustering around 
outside and a man blustering 
around inside!” 
“Oh, it’s you. Miss O’Day,” the 
receptionist said disappointedly 
as her face replaced the shifting 
pattern on the screen. 
“Yes, it’s me — Cherry O’Day, 
Coefficient B, Shift B. And there’s 
still a man in my apartment!” 
“Naturally,” said the receptionist wearily. “You understood 
when you were assigned to the 
dormitory that—” 
“I understood there would be a 
man or a woman. But I was also 
assured that regardless of whatever else it was, it would be Coefficient A, Shift A, and that it 
would be either working or at 
recreation during the twelve 
hours I am entitled to the apartment!” 
“I know,” the receptionist said 
impatiently. “And it — I mean he 
is Coefficient of Existence A, but 
Shift B — the same shift as yours.” 
“And every time I turn around 
in my apartment, there he is — or, 
rather, there he isn’t. What spacehappy idiot in your office assigned 
him to the right CE, but the 
wrong shift?” 
^HERRY stamped her foot 
and folded her arms so there 
would be no question as to the 
uncompromising nature of her indignation. 
“We have your complaint on 
file, Miss O’Day,” the receptionist 
began formally, “and—” 
“Then do something about it! 
I don’t care to spend any more 
sleep periods in bed with a man, 
however relatively immaterial he 
may be!” 
The receptionist shrugged apathetically. “These things take 
time, you know.” 
“Is Art — is Mr. Edson in?” 
“Not yet. The A-Shift Expediter is still on duty. Would you 
like to speak with him?” 
“Never mind,” Cherry answered 
stiffly. “I’ll be in later.” 
Exasperated, she snapped off 
the videocom. If there was one 
thing she was sure of, it was that 
she would stand for no more delay in regaining unchallenged occupancy of her apartment during 
her B-Shift off-period. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
This Mr. Whatever-His-NameIs was imminently close to getting 
thrown out on his ear regardless 
of his unguessable bulk . provided she could improvise some 
means of locating his nonexistent 
ear. 
Resolutely, she strode back 
into the hall and waited next to 
the bathroom door, focusing her 
rage on the mocking patter of 
shower water against porcelain 
and flesh. 
Then she winced as his deep 
bass voice rose gratingly off key: 
“Oh-h-h-h, the ship slipped out 
of Hyper 
With-h-h-h the motions of a 
viper . 
Furiously, she beat on the door. 
The spray stopped like the tailend of a cloudburst. 
“Still out there?” There was 
more amusement than annoyance 
in his tone. 
“Sometime this morning,” she 
said with forced control, “I am 
expected to report to work. Before then, however, there are 
some trifling personal necessities 
I must attend to — if you will concede,” she was shouting now, “that 
I am entitled to the use of my 
bathroom!” 
“Temper, temper!” he chided. 
“Our bathroom.” His voice was 
mockingly placating as the doorknob turned. “After all, I’m -as 
much inconvenienced as you. But 
do I go aroimd shouting?” 
The door swimg open and a 
large white towel, briskly rubbing 
nothing, swept past her and into 
the bedroom. 
“You could at least move out,” 
she said, following the towel and 
squinting as though she might 
find something else to direct her 
words to, “before the whole base 
discovers I’m sharing my apartment with a Coefficient A man 
who’s on the B-Shift!” 
The towel fluttered down and 
draped itself across the back of a 
chair. 
“It could be worse,” he suggested. “Suppose I were Coefficient B, like you. Then thejr’d 
really have something to waggle 
their tongues about.” The disembodied voice receded as its owner 
crossed the room. 
“Please move out!” she begged. 
“Back to the shuttle? Uh-uh. 
You move out.” 
“This is my apartment and you 
aren’t going to tell me — ” 
“Ah-ah! Watch that blood pressure, sweetheart!” 
A DRESSER drawer opened 
and, a moment later, closed. 
Then another. But, naturally, she 
couldn’t see any of the things he 
was withdrawing; they were Displacement A articles so they 
could co-exist in the same space 
with her clothes. 
For a long while, she was silent, 
trying to control her rage, not 
SHARE ALIKE 
caring that time was slipping by 
and she would be even later for 
work. If she could only do something! 
The locker door opened and 
the light went on inside, illuminating her clothes on the racks — 
the same racks that held his 
things, only on a. different level of 
existence. 
Smiling vengefully, she went 
stealthily forward, until she realized she and her personal effects 
were as immaterial and invisible 
to him as he was to her. Then she 
lunged across the remaining distance and slammed the door, locking it. 
“Now,” she said triumphantly, 
“you may come out when you 
agree to vacate!” 
Silence. 
“Otherwise you’ll stay in there 
until the Expediter comes and 
straightens out this mess.” 
A sudden burst of laughter exploded behind her and she spun 
around, crying out apprehensively. 
“I wondered when you’d try 
something like that,” he chuckled. 
She watched the broad impression return in the sofa cushion, 
straining her eyes as though she 
might force herself to negotiate, 
visually at least, the barrier between the two coefficients of existence. 
Then, impulsively, she seized a 
vase from the dresser and hurled 
it. 
Spilling artificial flowers, it 
jolted to a stop in midair above 
the sofa. The cushion’s hollow 
smoothed out abruptly and the 
vase drifted erratically back to its 
place on the dresser. 
“Easy, honey! How’d you like 
it if I started throwing mutually 
existent things at you?” 
Cherry waited until he left and 
then rushed through her shower, 
regaining some of the time she 
had lost, and hurriedly dressed 
with only token attention to detail. 
She darted across the lobby 
and slammed into the Coefficient 
Booth. Using her B-type key, she 
activated the rectifiers and waited 
until her displacement was erased 
and until the door swung open. 
Then, once again on a normal 
plane of existence, she raced outside. 
I^ORTUNATELY there was a 
bus waiting at the stop. It 
whisked her to the Expediter’s 
office, where she soon stood fuming in front of his desk. 
“Art, how long is this going to 
last?” 
“That man again?” Only half 
holding back a smile, he ran a 
hand over his closely cropped 
blond hair and came around the 
desk. 
“You’ve got to do something!” 
she burst out. 
“Look, Cherry — we’re doing 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
the best we can. It was the A-Shift 
Expediter’s mistake. He’s checking it through now.” 
“I’ve had enough! I’m going 
straight to the Coordinator!” 
Art shrugged. “Can’t. He’s 
eighty-six million miles away on a 
survey of Rigel V-Port.” 
“And what am I supposed to 
do in the meantime?” 
“You might try bearing with us 
and making the best of the situation. Anyway, even if we found 
out how the mistake was made, 
we couldn’t do anything about it 
right now. The unmarried personnel quarters are all filled. We’d 
have to change his shift. That 
would upset the balance of the 
entire working force.” 
“You could make him move 
back aboard the shuttle,” she insisted. 
“The shuttle’s been sent to VPort. Don’t you see. Cherry, we’re 
helpless until the Coordinator returns? In any case, it can’t be all 
that serious. You and this fellow 
are on different coefficients of existence, so it can’t be a critical 
question of morals.” 
“Oh, it can’t, can’t it?” she said. 
“Just tell me who he is — how I 
can meet him face to face!” 
Art spread his hands helplessly. 
“You know if he’s in there by mistake, there’s no way of tracking 
down his identity until we find 
out how the mistake was made. 
Housing assignments are re
stricted— a matter of preserving 
privacy under the apartmentsharing plan.” 
She drew herself up to her full 
five foot two. “If you thought anything of me, you’d find some way 
to dump him out on his neck.” 
“Now how can I do that?” he 
reasoned. “Like you, all I’ve got is 
a B-key, which makes him nonexistent to me, too, while we’re in 
the dormitory. Taking a sock at 
nothing wouldn’t do any good. 
And I don’t think I could forcibly 
convince nothing to tell me who 
he is so I could settle with him 
outside.” 
She let her chin and shoulders 
down. “I give up. What am I supposed to do — place myself at the 
mercy of a practical joker for the 
test of my time here?” 
“You might try marrying me, 
you little hothead. Then we could 
move into the married persons’ 
quarters and forget the whole 
thing.” 
“For the twentieth time — no!” 
“Why not. Cherry? What’s 
wrong with me?” 
She backed off and surveyed 
him. Actually, there wasn’t anything wrong with him. 
“For one thing, you don’t love 
me,” she accused. “If you did, you 
wouldn’t stand around and see me 
living in an apartment with another man.” 
“If I clear up the mistake — if 
I find some way to get him out — 
SHARE ALIKE 
will you marry me then?” 
She turned away. “No, Art. 
That’s what they expect the precolonization force to do — marry 
among themselves and stay on as 
colonists after everything is prepared.” 
“I’d forgotten,” he said dejectedly. “You’re going to make a 
career out of pre-colonization.” 
A T SPACE plot, Cherry rushed 
across the large, circular 
room to her calculator console. 
“Wish I had devastating looks,” 
Madge said jokingly as she gathered up her things. “Then I could 
throw away my clock, too.” 
Cherry glanced up at the time. 
She hadn’t expected to be an hour 
late to relieve the other girl. 
“Same trouble,” she explained. 
“I went to see Art again.” 
“Any results?” 
She shook her head irritably 
and began punching coordinate 
figures onto the tape. 
“Learn who he is?” Madge 
asked. 
“Not yet. But I will,” Cherry 
said resolutely. Then she drew 
back and stared incriminatingly 
at the keyboard as she surveyed 
a broken nail. 
Madge squirmed into her coat. 
“I’ve heard of guys like that. 
They think it’s fun — keeping a 
girl hopping when she can’t see 
him any more than he can see 
her. Does something for their 
masculine ego. But just catch him 
away from the dormitory without 
his CE-A and your CE-B and 
he’ll soon cower!” 
Cherry’s resolute expression 
slumped. “I can’t find out who he 
is. He’s protected by hidden-identity regulations.” 
She snatched open the top of 
the machine and jerked out the 
half-punched roll of tape. She had 
fed in data for at least three hyper-approach paths that would 
put incoming ships within frying 
distance of Rigel. She started 
over again with the first coordinates. 
Madge leaned over and nudged 
her in the ribs. “If you can’t get 
rid of the guy, why don’t you 
marry him? You’re already living 
with him, practically.” 
“Bright girl,” Cherry said, not 
in the least amused. 
“I’ll bet he wouldn’t frown on 
the suggestion if he knew his 
roommate was almost Miss Procyon VI.” 
Cherry hurled the role of tape 
and Madge ducked. 
Then she frowned troubledly. 
“Why do they have to have this 
silly setup of Coefficient Displacements to complicate pre-colonization work?” 
“Ultimate economy of space,” 
Madge said, parroting a phrase 
from the Handbook. “They could 
put two girls in one apartment 
and two men in another. But then 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
SHARE ALIKE 
the IV-Port base would need 
twice as many drawers, chairs, 
lockers, dressers, desks and so 
forth. It’s easier to have two shifts 
sharing the quarters at different 
times and separated on different 
planes of existence.” 
OENSIVELY, Cherry stood before the range, watching the 
pot of water come to a boil. 
Maybe she could manage to ignore the man until the Coordinator returned. After all, she reminded herself, he wasn’t really 
there at all, since they were assigned to different levels of existence while in the dormitory. She 
could hear him talk only because 
the air, which carried the vibrations of his voice, was mutually 
existent between them. 
Something rammed sharply 
into her back and she whirled 
around. 
“Sorry, darling,” the rumbling 
bass voice apologized. “Didn’t 
know you were here.” 
A frying pan, waist-high, circled wide around her and landed 
on a burner. She glared with her 
most annoyed expression for fully 
a minute before she realized the 
look was futile; as far as he was 
concerned, she wasn’t really there 
at all. 
The cupboard door swung out 
and a can of assorted vegetables 
made a descending arc to the 
range and began opening itself. 
“Oh-h-h-h, the ship slipped 
out 
“Please!” she shouted. “Please 
spare me that foghorn voice of 
yours!” 
The voice stopped, but the tune 
continued — in a shrill, off-key 
whistle. 
The can elevated, tipped over 
and poured its contents into the 
frying pan. 
Just like a man— not knowing 
when to use a pot. 
Eventually the whistling 
stopped and the fire was extinguished under the pan. A minute 
passed and she began hesitantly 
scanning the kitchen for moving 
articles that might betray his 
whereabouts. 
The cupboard opened again 
and a canister floated over to the 
table and kicked off its lid. A 
small mound of flour levitated 
from the container and drifted 
over toward her. Puzzled, she 
wondered what sort of recipe 
would call for “a handful of flour” 
to be added to vegetables. 
But the white mound steadied 
and hung motionless between her 
and the range. 
“This is my first experience 
with CE-Displacement,” he said 
thoughtfully. 
She backed away. The flour 
advanced, following her in a halfcircle around the kitchen. But 
how could he know where she 
was? 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
He laughed. “Imagine — you 
displaced a half-level above normal existence and me a half-level 
below.” 
“Three or four levels might be 
a better arrangement,” she said 
uncertainly, her eyes riveted on 
the flour. 
“Interesting, this CE-A and 
CE-B gimmick,” he continued, 
“and mutually co-existent articles 
— like the furnishings in the apartment and the food in the kitchen.” 
Of course! The apron she was 
wearing — that was how he knew 
where she was! It was only one 
of the apartment’s items that 
were as real to both of them as 
was the mound of flour in his 
hand. 
“Ever consider,” he suggested, 
“that there might be a way of 
seeing what you look like?” 
“You wouldn’t dare!” 
His breath came out with a 
pool and the flour covered her 
face with a fine powder. 
Stupefied, she stood staring in 
his direction. 
“Small chin,” he appraised, “upturned nose, rather high cheekbones. Hm-m-m . Blonde or 
brunette?” 
Enraged, she fled from the 
room. 
13 UT it was only the beginning 
^ of a climactic night, she 
found out soon after she activated 
the light filters on the windows 
and turned on a table lamp in the 
living room. 
She selected Brahms on the 
Central Relay Receiver. But before she could return to the sofa, 
the Lullabye faded and a dissonant bit of syncopation replaced 
it. 
Determinedly, she went back to 
the receiver and reset the dial. 
Even before she removed her 
hand, however, she felt the knob 
return to the other position. 
Tightening her grip, she moved 
it back. But again it rotated in 
the opposite direction. Deciding 
she could present a better display 
of unruffled dignity by not creating a scene, she got a book and 
returned to the sofa. 
But she had hardly read a 
paragraph before she felt the 
cushion under her sink considerably lower. An open magazine 
which she hadn’t noticed before 
drifted up and positioned itself in 
front of her book. 
She moved the book around in 
front of the magazine, but the 
magazine only leap-frogged over 
the book and once more blocked 
her vision. 
“There are two ends to this 
sofa,” she said with teeth-gritting 
politeness. 
“But, darling,” he protested facetiously, “there’s hardly any light 
over there.” 
She snapped to her feet and 
stood facing the depression in the 
SHARE ALIKE 
cushion. Then, in a flash of inspiration, she slammed the book 
shut and swung it sharply in front 
of her. That the volume was mutually co-existent was proved by 
the smack of paper against flesh. 
But her satisfaction quickly 
melted in embarrassment before 
his laughter. 
Frustrated, Cherry went to bed. 
But only minutes later, she felt 
the mattress sag under his weight. 
“Asleep, sweetheart?” he asked. 
She didn’t answer; she moved 
closer to the edge of the bed. 
There was no one there, she told 
herself. If she reached out, she 
would feel nothing except the 
empty space where his body — in 
another level of existence — held 
the top sheet up and away from 
the bottom one. 
Still, it was so upsettingly real 
— being aware of his every move, 
the pull of the covers when he 
tugged on them, the sound of his 
breathing. 
Abruptly, the section of the coexistent sheet that was folded 
back over the covers swung up 
and fluttered down on her face. 
She started to spring erect. But 
his hands, given reciprocal reality 
by the sheet, clasped her cheeks. 
Then his lips pressed down firmly 
against hers through the cloth. 
Fuming, she jumped from the 
bed, grabbed her pillow and 
stomped out to the sofa, trying 
not to hear his chuckling. 
If only she could come face to 
face with him outside! She would 
humiliate him so severely in front 
of everyone within earshot that 
he would become the laughing 
stock of the base and it would be 
impossible for him to stay on at 
IV-Port! 
Suddenly, a plan began taking 
shape and a smile relaxed her 
face as she gave it serious consideration. 
^ KERRY was up early the 
^ next morning and out through 
the Coefficient Displacement 
Stall before her phantom roommate was even awake. Hidden behind a plant in the outer lobby, 
she stood vigil with her eyes on 
the booth, secure in the knowledge that there was no exit from 
the dormitory except through the 
nucleo- polarizer. 
There was the subtle glow of 
the rectifier field inside the enclosure and a small, lean man 
stepped out, glancing anxiously at 
his watch. 
If she studied everyone who 
came through, she would at least 
provide herself with a list of possible suspects. And by eliminating 
those who didn’t meet the physical specifications, she could narrow the field down to a handful. 
Three women came through in 
quick succession, hardly allowing 
time for the glow to subside in 
the stall. Then a steady flow of 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
workers was emerging. That was 
even better, Cherry realized. If 
she managed to spot him while 
the lobby was filled with witnesses, the ridicule that she would 
heap on him would be more humiliating. 
Four more men, all the wrong 
sizes and shapes, and two women 
trailed out. Then came a stout 
man, but too short; next a tall 
man, but too thin. 
She was just beginning to 
doubt her chance for success 
when she heard a whistled song 
coming through from somewhere 
on the other side of the booth. Excitedly, she added subvocal words 
to the tune: “The ship slipped out 
of . .” 
The whistling stopped. But at 
least she knew he would be coming through shortly. 
The rectifier’s glow flared, then 
the next suspect stepped out. He 
was tall and muscular, heavy but 
not stout. And bald, with a fringe 
of hair circling his head like a 
horseshoe . 
Just the type! She had known 
all along that he would look 
something like that, even down to 
his almost contemptuous smile! 
She plunged from her hiding 
place, swinging her handbag. It 
caught him full in the chest and 
he fell back with a grunt of surprise. 
“Yot/re the one, you miserable 
sneak!” Cherry brought the bag 
up in an overhanded swing and 
down on his head. 
The last dozen or so persons 
who had come through the booth 
crowded around. 
“Hide out in a girl’s apartment, 
will you?” Her tongue worked 
like a lash as she aimed the bag 
at his face. “Try to take advantage of a clerical error!” 
TTE RETREATED, but she 
gave him no quarter. Her 
bag broke and spilled; she tossed 
it aside and used her hard little 
fists. 
Suddenly someone had her 
hands locked behind her and was 
pulling her away. 
“Cherry, you little hot pepper!” 
It was Art. “You don’t know who 
that is!” 
She turned around. “I — I 
don’t?” 
Her confounded victim had finally recovered and was brushing 
himself off. 
“Who is this girl, Mr. Ekison?” 
he asked. 
Art hesitated, then shrugged futilely. “This is Miss O’Day . 
Cherry, Coordinator Barton. He 
got back from V-Port late yesterday.” 
“Miss O’Day,” the man repeated thoughtfully. “This is a coincidence. I was just at your apartment.” 
“You — you were?” Cherry 
smiled weakly. 
SHARE ALIKE 
“I was hoping I could catch 
you before you checked out on 
your shift.” 
He straightened his coat and 
tie. “I thought I might find a way 
out of your difficulty.” 
“That’s very kind — ” 
“As a matter of fact, I still 
think I might.” He turned stiffly. 
“Drop by at my office and we’ll 
talk it over — say, in five or six 
weeks?” 
Rigidly, Cherry watched the 
Coordinator stride off. Then, 
numbly, she let Art lead her to 
the bus stop. 
“That temper is going to get 
you into trouble one of these 
days.” He shook his head solicitously. 
She felt frustration and despair 
sweep over her; then, all at once, 
she was crying against his chest. 
“Marry me,” he pleaded. “Then 
they’ll have to put us in the permanent residence quarters. I love 
you. Cherry.” 
She blinked up angrily into his 
face. “Prove it! Get that — that 
despicable thing out of my quarters!” 
“Then will you marry me?” 
She hesitated before giving him 
her twenty-first no. For a moment, she had remotely considered accepting — abandoning her 
plans for a pre-colonization career. 
After all, there wouldn’t be anyone like Art around when she 
reached the top. 
“I couldn’t possibly marry you 
now, even if I wanted to. How 
could I be sure I wouldn’t be doing it just to escape the man in 
my apartment?” 
“All right. Cherry. I’ll see what 
I can do about getting him out 
— even if it means sidestepping 
some of the regulations.” 
B ut Cherry was in no mood to 
wait until retribution, plodding at its customary snail’s pace, 
caught up with her immaterial 
roommate — not if she could help 
it along. 
At the end of her next recreation period, she waited on the 
handball court until she caught 
Madge reporting for physical culture before starting her day’s 
work. 
“Lend me your A-Displacement 
key,” she urged. 
Madge drew back. “Oh, no, you 
don’t! If you’re going to get in a 
jam, you’re going to do it without 
my help. The Handbook says it’s 
against regulations to swap Coefficients of Existence.” 
“But, Madge, don’t you see 
that’s the only way I can trap 
him — by cornering him in the 
apartment on his level of existence?” 
The other girl’s frown gave 
way to a mischievous grin. “Then 
you’ll let him have it?” 
“But good!” 
Madge handed over the A-key. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
“Good luck, kid!” she applauded. 
Cherry had wasted almost an 
hour off-shift finding Madge. But 
that was to her advantage. It 
would give Mr. What’s-His-Name 
time to get settled in the apartment before she descended on 
him. 
She hurried back to the dormitory and through the CE stall. 
Displaced on the new A-level, she 
strode across the inner lobby. As 
she turned into the corridor 
where her quarters were located, 
she saw a tall, muscular man 
twisting the key in her lock and 
entering. 
Quelling her anxiety, she slowed 
to give him a chance to become 
occupied so she could take him 
by complete surprise. 
At the door, she waited another 
minute, then noiselessly let herself in. He was on the other side 
of the room, bending down over 
the Central Relay Receiver! 
She crept across the carpet, 
sweeping up a straight-back chair 
as she advanced. 
Then she let out a triumphant 
cry and started the chair swinging down toward her now-material adversary. In the final second 
before it struck, he started to turn 
around. 
It was Art! 
The chair crashed against him 
and he collapsed in front of the 
receiver. 
Confounded, she stood staring 
down at him, vaguely wondering .. 
No — the man’s voice was a 
deep bass; Art’s was a moderate 
baritone. 
Then she was on her knees beside him as he sat up and shook 
his head groggily. 
“Little hellcat,” he muttered. 
She steadied his head between 
her hands. “Art, darling — I didn’t 
know . What were you doing?” 
“Told you I’d see what I could 
manage,” he mumbled. “Broke 
into the files to find out where 
your quarters were. Then got an 
A-Displacement key. Figured I’d 
catch him here. But he wasn’t in, 
after all.” 
“He’ll show up,” she promised. 
“We’ll get him!” 
She seized his arm to help him 
up. 
But he grunted in pain and 
grasped his shoulder. “Not now, 
we won’t get him.” 
His fingers gingerly explored 
the lump on his head. “I — I — 
Say, you’re A-Displacement too. 
How 
He toppled over. 
¥ N THE hospital, the doctor 
slipped out of his smock and 
came over to where Cherry stood 
anxiously in the corridor. 
“You did a real good job on 
him,” he said sarcastically. 
“Is he badly hurt?” she asked. 
“Slight concussion — plus a dis
SHARE ALIKE 
located shoulder — plus scalp lacerations.” 
She started toward the room 
into which they had wheeled Art. 
But the doctor stopped her. 
“He’s resting now. You won’t be 
able to see him until tomorrow.” 
She started slowly across Rigel 
IV-Port base for the dormitory, 
realizing remorsefully that she 
might have seriously hurt Art . 
and all on account of the man in 
her apartment! 
Her regret simmered into indignation and then deepened into 
a glowing rage as she hastened 
her steps. She covered the final 
block in a determined stride, her 
arms swinging and her fists 
clenched. 
It had gone far enough! Now 
she would end it. And when she 
got through, this Whoever-HeWas would sorely regret the day 
he had moved in with her! 
In the Displacement Booth, she 
used Madge’s key again, then 
went storming into her quarters. 
“Come on out!” she challenged 
as she crossed the living room. 
In the bedroom, she shouted, 
“Where are you?” 
She swept into the kitchen. “I 
know you’re somewhere!” 
But there was only silence. 
She had used Madge’s A-key, 
hadn’t she? 
Jerking open the closet door, 
she saw only his clothes on the 
rack — reassurance that she was 
now on his level of existence. 
But he was nowhere in the 
apartment. 
Very well, then, she would find 
something to do until he arrived 
— like ripping his clothes to 
shreds and destroying all his personal effects. 
She started with the top drawer 
of the dresser. 
A RT sat up, speechless. “That’s 
what I said,” Cherry was repeating. “I’m in love with him.” 
Groaning, he sank back down 
in the hospital bed. 
“I hated him so much, I guess 
it backfired,” she explained. “Anyway, he’s the man I want to 
marry.” 
He sprang upright again. “But 
you can’t do that!” 
She paced, looking blithesomely at the ceiling. “It’s his aggressiveness — his forcefulness — the 
way he takes over. And he’s so 
good-natured all the time. Do you 
suppose he’ll want to marry me. 
Art?” 
He swung his legs over the side, 
of the bed and sent his feet groping for his slippers. 
Smiling wistfully, she returned 
to the bedside. “Just think, he almost drove me into marrying you. 
Maybe I would have, if I hadn’t 
been afraid I was being forced 
into it to get away.” 
“But — but. Cherry, you don’t 
understand! I love you! And — ” 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
“He does, too. I know it. Besides, I’ve been living with him 
over a week.” 
“But he doesn’t love you! I 
mean — look, you don’t even know 
who he is!” 
“Oh, but I do. Furthermore, I 
know he purposely arranged it so 
that he’d be A-Displacement but 
B-Shift. He was in a position to 
swing it that way.” 
“He what?” 
“I went back to the apartment ■ 
after I left here. I was going to 
tear up his clothes, just for spite.” 
She reached into her handbag. “I 
found his identity card in the 
dresser.” 
She handed it to him. 
He reached out with his good 
arm and pulled her to him. He 
didn’t have to look at the photograph to know it was his own.

Hunting Down 
the Dodo 
By WILLY LEY 
O NCE upon a time, there 
lived on the island of 
Mauritius a bird named 
the dodo, with the scientific name 
of Didus ineptus. 
Come to think of it, this is not 
a good beginning. The story of 
the dodo is not a fairy tale but 
the truth, or as much truth as can 
still be established. Moreover, this 
first sentence is a very unscien
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
tific oversimplification. Let’s try 
to make it a bit more accurate. 
Then it will read just about like 
this: 
From a period, the beginning 
of which cannot be ascertained, 
but which might be considered 
roughly equivalent to the beginning of the glacial age in higher 
latitudes, until about the year 
1680 A.D., a large and flightless 
bird, classified as being the representative of a sub-order of the 
Columbiformes or pigeonlike 
birds, known to have existed on 
the island of Mauritius, or 
Zwaaneiland, also known as He 
de France, was called dodo, or 
dodaers, or dronte, but also dinde 
sauvage, W alchvogel or gekapte 
Zwaan (hooded swan) and several other names, with the scientific designation of either Didus 
ineptus or Raphus cucullatus, 
which are equivalent in scientific usage, but with Raphus cucullatus holding the chronological 
priority. 
Well, now, this is more accurate. 
It also complies with the order 
drilled into newspapermen: “Get 
all the facts into the first paragraph.” 
But I’m very much afraid it 
would probably be most intelligible to somebody who knows 
these facts already and who, logically, does not have much reason 
to read it at all. 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
T HAD better start over again,. 
this time with the fundamentals. To the east of Madagascar, 
strung out along the 20th parallel of southern latitude, there are 
three reasonably large islands. 
Their current names are Reunion, Mauritius and Rodriguez 
— at least, that’s the way the 
name of the last appears on 
Admiralty charts, both British 
and American. For some unfathomable reason, the dependency of Rodrigues, when it makes 
an official report to the colony 
of Mauritius, spells its name with 
an “s” at the end. I am making a 
point of this difference in spelling for the sole reason that it 
happens to be the smallest of all 
the difficulties and discrepancies 
we are going to encounter. The 
more serious problems will come 
up later. 
It is hard to say just who discovered these islands. There 
exists at least one old map on 
which the three islands have 
Arabic names. It is quite likely 
that Arab trading vessels did discover them, but without paying 
any special attention to their discovery, since the islands were 
uninhabited and it is exceedingly difficult to barter on uninhabited islands. 
At any event, the Arabs did 
not even bother to locate the 
islands with any degree of care. 
On the map mentioned, they are 
drawn as forming an equilateral 
triangle and are placed far too 
close to Madagascar. 
The first European discoverers 
were Portuguese but, strange to 
say, it was the second of the 
Portuguese discoverers who had 
his name attached to the islands. 
The first one was Diogo Fernandes Pereira, who sailed these 
waters in 1507. On February 9th 
of that year, he found an island 
some 400 miles to the east of 
Madagascar which he named 
Santa Apollonia. It must have 
been the present Reunion. Soon 
after, his ship, the Cerne, sighted 
the present Mauritius. The navigator landed and named the 
island after his ship, as Ilha do 
Cerne. 
This, I might say right here, 
led to two different misunderstandings. Much later, around the 
middle of the nineteenth century, 
somebody who obviously did not 
know the name of Pereira’s ship 
wondered why the navigator 
should have named the island 
after the island of Cerne, mentioned by Pliny the Elder. 
Wherever Pliny’s Cerne was located, it could not be to the east 
of Madagascar. 
The other misunderstanding 
took place quite soon after Pereira’s voyage. Dutch explorers who 
came to Mauritius and knew the 
old name thought that Cerne was 
a miswriting for eigne (swan) 
and that Pereira had thought the 
dodos to be swans. The Dutch 
did not bother with the zoological problem involved; they “trans
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
lated” Diogo Pereira’s name into 
Dutch as Zwaaneiland. 
Pereira, who was on his way 
to India, found Rodrigues later 
in the same year. It was first 
named Domingo Friz, but also 
Diego Rodriguez. The Dutch apparently found this hard to pronounce and talked about Diego 
Ruy’s island, which then was 
Frenchified into Dygarroys — but 
the official French name for a 
time was He Marianne. 
S IX years later came the second discoverer, Pedro Mascarenhas, who visited only Mauritius and Reunion. No name 
change was involved for Mauritius because of this rediscovery, 
but Santa Apollonia (Reunion) 
was renamed Mascarenhas or 
Mascaregne, and to this day the 
islands are called the Mascarene 
Islands. 
The subsequent history of the 
islands was just about as complicated as this beginning. Reunion, the largest of the three 
islands, 970 square miles in extent, was officially annexed to 
France in 1638 by a Captain 
Goubert from Dieppe. 
I don’t know why one annexation was not considered sufficient, 
but the historical fact is that the 
annexation was repeated in the 
name of Louis XIII in 1643 and 
once more in 1649 by Etienne de 
Flacourt, who changed the name 
Fig. 2: The dodo of Mauritius as sketched 
by Adrian van de Venne in 1626 
from Mascarenhas to He Bourbon. After the French Revolution, 
that name had to go, of course, 
and Reunion was re-established. 
But then history can be read 
quite easily from the various 
changes, for it became He Bonaparte. Since 1848, it is again 
Reunion. 
Considered non-politically. Reunion is a volcanic island with 
three rather tall peaks. The tallest 
is the Piton des Neiges, which 
measures 10,069 feet. The other 
high elevation is simply called 
Le Volcan by the inhabitants of 
the island, but Le Volcan has 
more than one peak. One, called 
Bory Crater, is 8,612 feet above 
sea level and extinct. The other 
crater, known as Fournaise, is 
only 8,294 feet tall but still 
active. 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
An island in such a location 
can grow tropical fruit and there 
are banana plantations and 
breadfruit trees, not to mention 
coconut palms. But these plants 
were introduced. The original 
vegetation included a dwarf bamboo, a variety of casuarina trees 
and a plant called by the trade 
name “red tacamahac,” botanically Calophyllutn spuiium. 
The second island, Mauritius, 
is somewhat smaller than Reunion (about 720 square miles) 
and likewise of volcanic origin. 
But all volcanic activity on Mauritius is a thing of the fairly distant past. The names of its three 
highest mountains reflect the 
changing ownership of the island 
Fig. 3: Life-size restoration of the dodo of 
Mauritius in the American Museum 
of Natural History, New York 
through the centuries. The highest one, 2711 feet, is called Black 
River Mountain. The second one, 
2685 feet, is Mt. Pieter Botte, 
while the third, 2650 feet, is 
called Pouce. 
The island is surrounded by 
coral reefs which a ship’s captain has to know well, but it has 
a fine natural harbor. These two 
features prompted the Dutch to 
annex it in 1598 and they gave it 
its current name after Count 
Maurits of Nassau. 
The Dutch abandoned Mauritius in 1710. For slightly more 
than a half a century (17151767), it was French and called 
He de France. In 1810, it was 
taken by the English, who 
Fig. 4: Skeleton of the Mauritius dodo, assembled from sub-fossil bones 
fCourfesy: AMNHJ 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
restored the Dutch name. 
Right now, Mauritius is a 
“spice island” where spices, pineapple, mangoes, avocados and 
bananas are grown, along with 
sugar cane. But the original vegetation is still represented by ironwood trees, ebony trees, traveler’s 
trees and bamboo. Of course, domesticated animals were introduced on both islands, but Mauritius is somewhat special even 
in that respect — the deer that can 
be found there came from Java, 
not from Europe. 
A S regards Rodriguez, its story 
is similar but shorter. Its 
extent is only 43 square miles. It 
is volcanic in origin, with 1300foot Mt. Limon as its highest 
peak, and there is a fringing coral 
reef. The ownership of the island 
was Dutch, French and English 
in succession. In all cases, the 
first inhabitants were either deportees or people in voluntary 
exile, some of them mutineers, 
some refugees from religious intolerance. 
Though all this had to be mentioned to establish a background, 
none of these facts would have 
made any of these islands famous. 
The only one which would enjoy a kind of restricted fame 
would be Mauritius, among stamp 
collectors, because of an early 
philatelic error which produced 
some of the rarest stamps in 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
existence. But these Mascarene* 
Islands are famous because they 
once were the home of the dodo 
and related birds. 
The story of the dodo (let’s 
concentrate on the Mauritius dodo 
for the time being) looks rather 
simple, if somewhat sad, in rough 
outline. Its existence was first reported by Dutch navigators, who 
were far less thorough in their 
descriptions than one would now 
wish they had been. But they 
made up for this to some extent 
by bringing live specimens back 
with them to Europe. There they 
were painted, mostly by Dutch 
painters and, again it must be 
said, not as well as one would 
now wish. 
But the major blunder was 
committed in England. About 
1637, give or take a year, a live 
Mauritius dodo arrived in England. It lived there for quite some 
time, and after its death, it was 
“stuffed” (badly, no doubt) and 
found a place in Tradescant’s 
Museum in London in 1656. A 
few decades later, the stuffed 
dodo was transferred to the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford. This 
was in 1683 — as we now know, 
two years after the last report of 
a live dodo on Mauritius was put 
on paper by one Benjamin Harry. 
In 1755, the curator of the Ashmolean Museum decided that 
the moth-eaten old skin was a 
disgrace to his fine collection and 
ordered that it be thrown away 
to be burned with other trash. At 
the last moment, somebody 
wrenched off the head (partly decayed) and one foot (in good 
condition). They are now about 
the rarest items on record. 
VEN this outline story contains one more surprising 
item. The first scientist to include 
the dodo as an exotic bird in a 
book on natural history was 
Carolus Clusius in 1605. Later, 
Carolus Linnaeus gave it a scientific name, and quite naturally 
the dodo entered into the zoological works of Buffon in France 
and Blumenbach in Germany. 
But by 1800, nobody had ever 
seen a dodo. The available paintings did not seem convincing. 
They looked like caricatures to 
begin with and did not even agree 
with each other. 
Some scientists, bent on a 
housecleaning in scientific, literature, began to doubt whether 
there had ever been such a bird. 
Maybe it was all a misunderstanding, if not worse, and the 
descriptions had meant the cassowary. 
At any event J. S. Duncan of 
Oxford felt obliged, in 1828, to 
write a paper with the title: “A 
summary review of the authorities on which naturalists are justified in believing that the Dodo, 
Raphus cucullatus {Didus inep
74 
tus), was a bird existing in the 
Isle of France, or the neighbouring islands, until a recent period.” 
Mr. Duncan can be said to have 
saved the dodo from secondary 
extinction in scientific literature. 
But let’s go back now to the 
original sources. The first man 
to write about the dodo was the 
Dutch Admiral Jacob Corneliszoon van Neck, who went to 
Mauritius with eight ships. Four 
of them returned to Holland in 
1599, the other four in 1601. 
Admiral van Neck’s narrative appeared in Dutch in 1601 and 
translations into English, French 
and Latin were printed during 
the same year, a German translation one year later. 
In spite of this volume of 
printed matter, there are still a 
number of question marks. The 
original journal, presumably written on shipboard, was enlarged 
for publication — we don’t know 
whether by the admiral himself 
or by an editor. Moreover, one 
old naturalist, who did not leave 
Europe, gave a dodo picture 
which, he said, was copied from 
Admiral van Neck’s journal. But 
this picture cannot be found in 
any known edition of the journal. 
The passage in the admiral’s 
journal in which the dodo is first 
mentioned reads: 
Blue parrots are very numerous 
there [referring to Mauritius] as 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
wen as other birds; among which 
are a kind, conspicuous for their size, 
larger than our swans, with huge 
heads only half covered with skin, 
as if clothed with a hood. These 
birds lack wings, in the place of 
which three or four blackish feathers 
protrude. The tail consists of a few 
soft incurved feathers which are 
ash-colored. These we used to call 
Walghvogels for the reason that the 
more and the longer they were 
cooked, the less soft and more insipid eating they became. Nevertheless, their belly and breast were 
of a pleasant flavor and easily 
masticated. 
^I^HE Dutch word Walghvogels 
(also spelled Walchvogels'} 
translates literally as “nauseating 
birds,” but it led to one of the 
many mistakes that crowd the 
dodo’s short life history. 
About two hundred years later, 
it was asserted in German books 
that there had been Forest Birds, 
so named, on Mauritius. There 
probably were, and still are, 
forest birds on Mauritius, but the 
Forest Bird was only a sloppy 
translation, appearing in its German form of Waldvogel. Spelling 
in those days was helter-skelter in 
any language, so somebody probably thought that “walgh” was 
just a poor rendering of “Waldt,” 
a then frequent spelling of the 
German word Wald, which means 
forest. 
Since this has raised the problem of the name of the bird, it 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
might be just as well to clear 
up this additional difficulty as* 
much as possible. 
In the most recent specialized 
professional work on the dodo, 
by the Marquis Masauji Hachisuka, not less than seventy-nine 
different names are listed. But the 
confusion is not quite as large 
as this figure seems to indicate, 
for the names clearly fall into a 
small number of classes. 
One set of them tries to be 
descriptive. They are mostly 
French, as, for example, austruche 
encapuchonne (hooded ostrich), 
cygne capuchonne (hooded swan) 
and dinde sauvage (wild turkey). 
Another set are either translations or mistranslations of Dutch 
names. The Dutch names themselves are either variations on the 
theme of walghvogels or else descriptive terms similar to the 
French names just mentioned. 
Just two words emerge as, so 
to speak, “exclusive” terms. One 
is the name dodo, with the variations dodaars and dodaerts, and 
the other one is dr onto. 
It is reasonably certain that 
“dodo” is a name coined by the 
Portuguese, as witness a letter 
written in 1628 by Emanuel Altham about “very strange fowles 
called by ye portingals Do Do.” 
The fact that Altham pulled 
the two syllables apart, thereby 
changing their pronunciation, is 
“very suspicious-making,” as a 
French lady I know phrased it. 
It is so suspicious — or, rather, 
indicative — because old Dutch 
and German writings spell the 
name as doedoe and dudu, all of 
which must be pronounced “doodoo.” Since it has no real meaning in any language, it can well 
be, as has been asserted, an imitation of the bird’s call. 
The Dutch variation dod-aars 
or dod-aers is rather clear to an 
English speaker, especially in 
view of the Dutch descriptive remarks ende heeit een rond gat 
(“and has a round rump,” as van 
Neck put it) or rond van stuiten 
(“round of stern,” as Capt. Willem van West-Zanen wrote in 
1602). 
ITOWEVER, the name dronte, 
which in Dutch and in German was used about equally frequently as dodo, still is not explained. The Englishman H. E. 
Strickland, who wrote the first 
book about the dodo in 1848, 
and it is still good, accepted the 
explanation that this term was 
coined by Danish sailors, using 
their verb drunte, which means 
“to be slow.” This is not only 
somewhat far-fetched on the face 
of it, for the Danes, for a change, 
have not contributed anything to 
the story of this bird; it is not 
even necessarily correct. We 
simply don’t know whether the 
dodo was slow and the evidence 
is not very much in favor of this 
assumption. 
The Dutch zoologist Prof. 
A. C. Oudemans— yes, the man 
who wrote the 600-page book on 
the Sea Serpent— has pointed out 
—in another book devoted to the 
dodo only — that there was a 
now obsolete Middle - Dutch 
verb dronten. Its meaning was 
“bloated” or “swollen,” which 
sounds much more reasonable. 
But Prof. Oudemans could not 
prove that this was actually the 
derivation; a lot of early writings on the dodo seem to be lost. 
The records are incomplete 
also as regards the number of 
birds taken away alive. If it were 
not for a chance mention in Peter 
Mundy’s journal — he served with 
the East India Company from 
1628 to 1634 — we would never 
know that two of them were 
brought to India. But his statement is definite; “Dodoes, a 
strange kind of fowle, twice as big 
as a Goose, that can neither flye 
nor swimm, being Cloven footed; 
I saw two of them in Suratt [the 
first British settlement in India, 
started 1612] house that were 
brought from thence [ Mauritius].” 
There is a similar chance mention about one having been sent 
to Japan, but Japanese scientists 
have failed, in spite of much effort, to trace its fate from Japanese chronicles and books. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
Going by such remarks on the 
one hand and, on the other hand, 
by sketches and paintings stated 
or reported to have been made 
from life. Dr. Hachisuka listed a 
total of twelve specimens of the 
Mauritius dodo as having arrived 
in Europe: one in Italy, two in 
England and nine— five males and 
four females— in Holland. 
In other books, particularly in 
works which treat the paintings 
as paintings instead of as ornithological illustrations, larger 
figures are usually mentioned. 
This is partly due to counting 
sketches and paintings made from 
earlier paintings. Mostly, however, it is due to the fact that no 
distinction is made between the 
gray Mauritius dodo and similar 
birds from the other two Mascarene Islands. 
T>UT no list, whether of specimens or of paintings, can 
be considered final. In 1914 and 
1915, a German scientist. Dr. 
S. Killermann, set out on a systematic dodo hunt in museums, 
libraries and art galleries and discovered about half a dozen pictures that had simply been overlooked before. Killermann’s feat 
could probably be repeated by 
somebody today with the inclination and the necessary time 
and money. 
As has been mentioned, the 
Clusius picture has been copied 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
from a lost original of van Neck’s 
journal. Somebody might still 
find it. Similarly, it is known that 
an unnamed artist on board of 
one of the ships commanded by 
Admiral Wolphart Harmanszoon 
made several drawings from life 
while the ship was in Mauritius 
harbor in 1602. The originals are 
now “lost,” but somebody might 
find them. 
Likewise, one of the several oil 
paintings of dodos made by Roelandt Savery is listed as lost. 
In short, while a dodo investigation is no longer virgin territory, it is still a fertile field with 
possibilities for a diligent researcher. 
One of the earliest and best 
pictures of a Mauritius dodo 
drawn from life is the pen-andink drawing by Adrian van de 
Venne. It was made in 1626 and 
shows a male. This is what we 
now think of as the normal appearance of the dodo. However, 
it was Prof. Oudemans who first 
realized that the dodo must have 
had two “normal appearances”— 
one fat stage and one gaunt stage. 
This assumption explains many 
old sketches which look like caricatures; the latter impression is 
considerably strengthened by the 
fact that a number of sketches 
were made while the birds were 
moulting. 
Oudemans’ idea makes it possible to arrange all these sketches 
in a logical sequence, pre-moulting, at the height of the moult, 
post-moulting, fat and gaunt. But 
why a bird on a tropical island, 
where the food supply should be 
more or less the same all year 
round, should go through a gaunt 
stage at regular intervals is not 
yet fully explained. 
The Mauritius dodo became 
extinct between 1681, the last 
time it is mentioned as living, 
and 1693, the first time it fails 
to appear on a list of the animals 
and birds of the island made on 
the spot. By 1750, the people 
living on the island did not even 
know any more that there had 
been such a bird. 
A hundred years later, there 
lived a man on Mauritius who 
was an ardent naturalist. This 
man, George Clark, not only knew 
about the dodo, but was determined to find dodo remains. They 
had to be somewhere on the 
island, for the entire species 
could not possibly have become 
extinct without leaving traces. 
But where would these traces be 
located? 
At first glance, the situation did 
not look too promising. “In fact,” 
George Clark wrote, “there is no 
part of Mauritius where the soil 
is of such a nature as to render 
probable the accidental internment of substances thrown upon 
it. It may be classed under four 
heads: stiff clay; large masses of 
stone forming a chaotic surface; 
strata of melted lava, locally 
called paves, impervious to everything; and loam, intermixed with 
fragments of vesicular basalt— the 
latter too numerous and too 
thickly scattered to allow anything to sink into the mass by 
the mere force of gravity. Besides 
this, the tropical rains, of which 
the violence is well known, sweep 
the surface of the earth in many 
places with a force sufficient to 
displace stones of several hundred pounds weight.” 
A FTER having reached this 
point, Clark all of a sudden 
had a new idea. If these tropical 
rains swept everything before 
them, where did they sweep it? 
Well, there was a kind of delta 
formed by three rivers running 
into the harbor of Mahebourg. If 
dodo bones had been washed into 
one of the rivers, this was the 
likely place where they might 
have come to rest. One part of 
that delta was a marsh known 
locally as - le Mare aux Songes. 
Mr. Clark promised himself that 
he would dig there, as soon as he 
had the time and some means 
to pay laborers for the actual 
work. 
About 1863, he began to dig, 
finding large numbers of dodo 
bones at the very bottom of the 
marsh, to the delight of anatomists, and to the intense aston
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
ishment of aged creoles who were 
standing around and were somewhat annoyed by seeing something on their own island which 
they had not known about. As a 
result of George Clark’s successful digging, there is no doubt 
about the dodo’s skeleton. As a 
matter of fact, it was this material 
which helped to unravel such 
problems as were posed by the 
sketches of artists who did not 
know anatomy — at any rate, not 
bird anatomy. 
And while no museum can 
have an authentic dodo, several 
museums can, at least, boast authentic dodo skeletons, like the 
one at the Smithsonian Institution which was put together by 
Norman H. Boss. 
The American Museum of 
Natural History in New York 
has such a skeleton, too, but it 
also has something which makes 
casual visitors wonder whether a 
dried skin might have survived 
somewhere. 
The museum has a restoration, 
made in the taxidermy studios of 
Rowland Ward in London, The 
feet and the head are copied 
from the preserved specimens. 
The feathers are those of other 
birds, correct in color and, as 
far as can be ascertained, correct in shape. The dodo is in the 
fat stage, the one we know best 
from pictures. 
Well, this is the somewhat 
sporadic story of the gray dodo 
of Mauritius. But there are two 
more Mascarene Islands and they 
had dodolike birds, too. We’ll go 
into that story in the next issue.

To commit the flawless crime, all Barthold

E verett BarthoW didn’t 
take out a life insurance 
policy casually. First he 
read up on the subject, with special attention to Breach of Contract, Willful Deceit, Temporal 
Fraud, and Payment. He checked 
to find how closely insurance 
companies investigated before 
paying a claim. And he acquired a 
considerable degree of knowledge 
on Double Indemnity, a subject 
which interested him acutely. 
When this preliminary work 
was done, he looked for an insurance company which would

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 
Illustrated by DILLON 
suit his needs. He decided, finally, 
upon the Inter-Temporal Insurance Corporation, with its main 
office in Hartford, Present Time. 
Inter-Temporal had branch offices in the New York of 1959, 
Rome, 1530, and Constantinople, 
1126. Thus they offered full tem
poral coverage. This was important to Barthold’s plans. 
Before applying for his policy, 
Barthold discussed the plan with 
his wife. Mavis Barthold was a 
thin, handsome, restless woman, 
with a cautious, contrary feline 
nature. 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
“It’ll never work,” she said at 
once. 
“It’s foolproof,” Barthold told 
her firmly. 
“They’ll lock you up and throw 
away the key.” 
“Not a chance,” Barthold assured her. “It can’t miss — if you 
cooperate.” 
“That would make me an accessory,” said his wife. “No, 
darling.” 
“My dear, I seem to remember 
you expressing a desire for a coat 
of genuine Martian scart. I believe there are very few in existence.” 
IVTRS. Barthold’s eyes glittered. 
Her husband, with canny accuracy, had hit her weak spot. 
“And I thought,” Barthold said 
carelessly, “that you might derive some pleasure from a new 
Daimler hyper-jet, a Letti Det 
wardrobe, a string of matched 
ruumstones, a villa on the Venusian Riviera, a — ” 
“Enough, darling!” Mrs. Barthold gazed fondly upon her enterprising husband. She had long 
suspected that within his unprepossessing body beat a stout 
heart. Barthold was short, beginning to bald, his features ordinary, and his eyes were mild behind horn-rimmed glasses. But his 
spirit would have been perfectly 
at home in a pirate’s greatmuscled frame. 
“Then you’re sure it will 
work?” she asked him. 
“Quite sure, if you do what I 
tell you and restrain your fine 
talent for overacting.” 
“Yes, dear,” said Mrs. Barthold, 
her mind fixed upon the glitter of 
ruumstones and the sensuous 
caress of scart fur. 
Barthold made his final preparations. He went to a little shop 
where some things were advertised and other things sold. He 
left, several thousand dollars 
poorer, with a small brown suitcase tucked tightly under his 
arm. The money was imtraceable. He had been saving it, in 
small bills, for several years. And 
the contents of the brown suitcase were equally untraceable. 
He deposited the suitcase in a 
public storage box, drew a deep 
breath and presented himself at 
the offices of the Inter-Temporal 
Insurance Corporation. 
For half a day, the doctors 
poked and probed at him. He 
filled out the forms and was 
brought, at last, to the office 
of Mr. Gryns, the regional manager. 
Gryns was a large, affable man. 
He read quickly through Barthold’s application, nodding to 
himself. 
“Fine, fine,” he said. “Everything seems to be in order. Except for one thing.” 
“What’s that?” Barthold asked, 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
his heart suddenly pounding. 
“The question of additional 
coverage. Would you be interested in fire and theft? Liability? Accident and health? We insure against everything from a 
musket ball to such trivial but 
annoying afflictions as the very 
definitely common cold.” 
“Oh,” said Barthold, his pulse 
rate subsiding to normal. “No, 
thank you. At present, I am concerned only with a life insurance 
policy. My business requires me 
to travel through time. I wish 
adequate protection for my wife.” 
“Of course, sir, absolutely,” 
Gryns said. “Then I believe 
everything is in order. Do you 
understand the various conditions 
that apply to this policy?” 
“I think I do,” replied Barthold, 
who had spent months studying 
the Inter-Temporal standard 
form. 
“The policy runs for the life 
of the assured,” said Mr. Gryns. 
“And the duration of that life is 
measured only in subjective 
physiological time. The policy 
protects you over a distance of 
1000 years qn either side of the 
Present. But no further. The 
risks are too great.” 
“I wouldn’t dream of going any 
further,” Barthold said. 
“And the policy contains the 
usual double indemnity clause. 
Do you understand its function 
and conditions?” 
“I believe so,” answered Barthold, who knew it word for word. 
“All in order, then. Sign right 
here. And here. Thank you, sir.” 
“Thank you,” said Barthold. 
And he really meant it. 
T> ARTHOLD returned to his 
" office. He was sales manager 
for the Alpro Manufacturing 
Company (Toys for All the 
Ages). He announced his intention to leave at once on a sales 
tour of the Past. 
“Our sales in time are simply 
not what they should be,” he said. 
“I’m going back there myself and 
take a personal hand in the selling.” 
“Marvellous!” cried Mr. Carlisle, the president of Alpro. “I’ve 
been hoping for this for a long 
time, Everett.” 
“I know you have, Mr. Carlisle. Well, sir, I came to the decision just recently. Go back there 
yourself, I decided, and find out 
what’s going on. Went out and 
made my preparations and now 
I’m ready to leave.” 
Mr. Carlisle patted him on the 
shoulder. “You’re the best salesman Alpro ever had, Everett. I’m 
very glad you decided to go.” 
“I am, too, Mr. Carlisle.” 
“Give ’em hell! And by the 
way — ” Mr. Carlisle grinned slyly— “I’ve got an address in Kansas City, 1895, that you might be 
interested in. They just don’t 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
build ’em that way any more. 
And in San Francisco, 1840, I 
know a — ” 
“No, thank you, sir,” Barthold 
said. 
“Strictly business, eh, Everett?” 
“Yes, sir,” Barthold said, with 
a virtuous smile. “Strictly business.” 
Everything was in order now. 
Barthold went home and packed 
and gave his wife her last instructions. 
“Remember,” he told her, 
“when the time comes, act surprised, but don’t simulate a 
nervous breakdown. Be confused, 
not psychotic.” 
“I know,” she said. “Do you 
think I’m stupid or something?” 
“No, dear. It’s just that you do 
have a tendency to wring every 
bit of emotion out of situations. 
Too little would be wrong. So 
would too much.” 
“Honey,” said Mrs. Barthold in 
a very small voice. 
“Yes?” 
“Do you suppose I could buy 
one little ruumstone now? Just 
one to sort of keep me company 
until 
“No! Do you want to give the 
whole thing away? Damn it all. 
Mavis — ” 
“All right. I was only asking. 
Good luck, darling.” 
“Thank you, darling.” 
They kissed. 
And Barthold left. 
TTE reclaimed his brown suitcase from the public storage 
box. Then he took a heli to the 
main showroom of Temporal 
Motors. After due consideration, 
he bought a Class A Unlimited 
Flipper and paid for it in cash. 
“You’ll never regret this, sir,” 
said the salesman, removing the 
price tag from the glittering machine. “Plenty of power in this 
baby! Double impeller. Full control in all years. No chance of 
being caught in stasis in a Flipper.” 
“Fine,” Barthold said. “I’ll just 
get in and — ” 
“Let me help you with those 
suitcases, sir. You understand that 
there is a federal tax based upon 
your temporal milage?” 
“I know,” Barthold said, carefully stowing his brown suitcase 
in the back of the Flipper. 
“Thanks a lot. I’ll just get in 
and — ” 
“Right, sir. The time clock is 
set at zero and will record your 
jumps. Here is a list of time 
zones proscribed by the government. Another list is pasted to 
the dashboard. They include all 
major war and disaster areas, as 
well as Paradox Points. There is 
a federal penalty for entering a 
proscribed area. Any such entry 
will show on the time clock.” 
“I know all this.” Barthold suddenly was very nervous. The 
salesman couldn’t suspect, of 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
course. But why was he going on 
gabbling so about breaches of the 
law? 
“I am required to tell you the 
regulations,” the salesman said 
cheerfully. “Now, sir, in addition, 
there is a thousand-year limit on 
time jumps. No one is allowed 
beyond that, except with written 
permission from the State Department.” 
“A very proper precaution,” 
Barthold said, “and one which my 
insurance company has already 
advised me of.” 
“Then that takes care of everything. Pleasant journey, sir! 
You’ll find your Flipper the perfect vehicle for business or 
pleasure. Whether your destination is the rocky roads of Mexico, 
1932, or the damp tropics of 
Canada, 2308, your Flipper will 
see you through.” 
Barthold smiled woodenly, 
shook the salesman’s hand and 
entered the Flipper. He closed 
the door, adjusted his safety belt, 
started the motor. Leaning forward, teeth set, he calibrated his 
jump. 
Then he punched the send-off 
switch. 
A gray nothingness surrounded 
him. Barthold had a moment of 
absolute panic. He fought it down 
and experienced a thrill of fierce 
elation. 
At last, he was on his way to 
fortune! 
TMPENETRABLE grayness, 
surrounded • the Flipper like a 
faint and endless fog. Barthold 
thought of the years slipping by, 
formless and without end, gray 
world, gray universe ... 
But there was no time for philosophical thoughts. Barthold unlocked the small brown suitcase 
and removed a sheaf of typed papers. The papers, gathered for 
him by a temporal investigation 
agency, contained a complete 
history of the Barthold family, 
down to its earliest origins. 
He had spent a long time 
studying that history. His plans 
required a Barthold. But not just 
any Barthold. He needed a male 
Barthold, 38 years old, unmarried, out of touch with his family, 
with no close friends and no important job. If possible, with no 
job at all. 
He needed a Barthold who, if 
he suddenly vanished, would 
never be missed, never searched 
for. 
With those specifications, Barthold had been able to cut 
thousands of Bartholds out of 
his list. Most male Bartholds 
were married by the age of 38. 
Some hadn’t lived that long. 
Others, single and unattached at 
38, had good friends and strong 
family ties. Some, out of contact 
with family and friends, were 
men whose disappearance would 
be investigated. 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
After a good deal of culling, 
Barthold was left with a mere 
handful. These he would check, 
in the hope of finding one who 
suited all his requirements . 
7f such a man existed, he 
thought, and quickly banished 
the thought from his mind. 
After a while, the grayness dissolved. He looked out and saw 
that he was on a cobblestone 
street. An odd, high-sided automobile chugged past him, driven 
by a man in a straw hat. 
He was in New York, 1912. 
' I ■’HE first man on his list was 
Jack Barthold, known to his 
friends as Bully Jack, a journeyman printer with a wandering 
eye and a restless foot. Jack had 
deserted his wife and three children in Cheyenne in 1902, with 
no intention of returning. For 
Barthold’s purposes, this made 
him as good as single. Bully Jack 
had served a hitch with General 
Pershing, then returned to his 
trade. He drifted from print shop 
to print shop, never staying long. 
Now, at the age of 38, he was 
working somewhere in New 
York. 
Barthold started at the Battery and began hunting his way 
through New York’s print shoos. 
At the eleventh one, on Water 
Street, he located his man. 
“You want Jack Barthold?” 
an old master printer asked him. 
“Sure, he’s in the back. Hey, 
Jack! Fellow to* see you!” 
Barthold’s pulse (juickened. A 
man was comio g toward him, out 
of the dark reC'esses of the shop. 
The man approached, scowling. 
“I’m Jack Biarthold,” he said. 
“Whatcha wanit?’’ 
Barthold looJked at his relative 
and sadly shoPk hiS head. This 
Barthold obviously would not 
do. 
“Nothing,” he said, “nothing at 
all.” He turned quickly and left 
the shop. 
Bully Jack, fve foot eight 
inches tall and weighing two 
hundred and ninety pounds, 
scratched his laead. 
“Now what in hell was all that 
about?” he asked, 
The old master printer 
shrugged his should ers. 
Everett Barthold returned to 
his Flipper and reset the controls. 
A pity, he told himself, but a 
fat man would never fit into his 
plans. 
H IS next stnp was Memphis, 
1869. Dressed in an appropriate costume, Barttiold went to 
the Dixie Belle Hotel and inquired at the desk for Ben Bartholder. 
“Well, suh,” said the courtly 
white-haired old mafi behind the 
desk, “his key’s in, so I reckon 
he’s out. You ronight find him in 
the corner saloon widh the other 
GALAXY science FICTION 
trashy carpetbaggers.” 
Barthold let the insult pass and 
went to the saloon. 
It was early evening, but the 
gaslights were already blazing. 
Someone was strumming a banjo 
and the long mahogany bar was 
crowded. 
“Where could I find Ben Bartholder?” Barthold asked a bartender. 
“Ovah theah,” the bartender 
said, “with the other Yankee 
drummers.” 
Barthold walked over to a long 
table at one end of the saloon. 
It was crowded with flashily 
dressed men and painted women. 
The men were obviously Northern salesmen, loud, self-confident 
and demanding. The women 
were Southerners. But that was 
their business, Barthold decided. 
As soon as he reached the 
table, he spotted his man. There 
was no mistaking Ben Bartholder. 
He looked exactly like Everett 
Barthold. 
And that was the vital characteristic Barthold was looking for. 
“Mr. Bartholder,” he said, 
“might I have a word with you 
in private?” 
“Why not?” said Ben Bartholder. 
Barthold led the way to a vacant table. His relative sat opposite him, staring intently. 
“Sir,” said Ben, “there is an 
uncanny resemblance between 
us.” 
“Indeed there is,” replied Barthold. “It’s part of the reason 
I’m here.” 
“And the other part?” 
“I’ll come to that presently. 
Would you care for a drink?” 
Barthold ordered, noticing that 
Ben kept his right hand in his 
lap, out of sight. He wondered if 
that hand held a derringer. 
Northerners had to be wary in 
these Reconstructionist days. 
After the drinks were served, 
Barthold said, “I’ll come directly 
to the point. Would you be interested in acquiring a rather 
large fortune?” 
“What man wouldn’t?” 
“Even if it involved a long 
and arduous journey?” 
“I’ve come all the way from 
Chicago,” Ben said. “I’ll go farther.” 
“And if it comes to breaking 
a few laws?” 
“You’ll find Ben Bartholder 
ready for anything, sir, if there’s 
some profit to it. But who are 
you and what is your proposition?” 
“Not here,” Barthold said. “Is 
there some place where we can 
be assured of privacy?” 
“My hotel room.” 
“Let’s go, then.” 
Both men stood up. Barthold 
glanced at Ben’s right hand and 
gasped. 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
Benjamin Bartholder had no 
right hand. 
“Lost it at Vicksburg,” explained Ben, seeing Barthold’s 
shocked stare. “It doesn’t matter. 
I’ll take on any man in the world 
with one hand and a stump — 
and lick him!” 
“I’m sure of it,” Barthold said 
a little wildly. “I admire your 
spirit, sir. Wait here a moment. I 
— I’ll be right back.” 
Barthold hurried out of the 
saloon’s swinging doors and went 
directly to his Flipper. A pity, he 
thought, setting the controls. Benjamin Bartholder would have 
been perfect. 
But a maimed man wouldn’t 
fit into his plan. 
T he next jump was to Prussia, 1676. With a hypnoed 
knowledge of German and 
clothes of suitable shape and hue, 
he walked the deserted streets 
of Konigsberg, looking for Hans 
Baerthaler. 
It was midday, but the streets 
were strangely, eerily deserted. 
Barthold walked and finally encountered a monk. 
“Baerthaler?” mused the monk. 
“Oh, you mean old Otto the 
tailor! He lives now in Ravensburg, good sir.” 
“That must be the father,” 
Barthold said. “I seek Hans Baerthaler, the son.” 
“Hans ... Of course!” The 
monk nodded vigorously, then 
gave Barthold a quizzical look. 
“But are you sPre that’s the man 
you want?” 
“Quite sure,” Barthold said. 
“Could you direct me to him?” 
“You can find him at the 
cathedral,” said the monk. 
“Come, I’m going there myself.” 
Barthold followed the monk, 
wondering if his information 
could be wrong. The Baerthaler 
he sought wasn’t a priest. He 
was a mercenary soldier who 
had fought all over Europe. His 
type would never be found at 
a cathedral — unless, Barthold 
thought with a shudder, Baerthaler had unreportedly acquired 
religion. 
Fervently he prayed that this 
wasn’t so. It would ruin everything. 
“Here we are, sir,” the monk 
said, stopping in front of a noble, 
soaring structure. “And there is 
Hans Baerthaler.” 
Barthold looked. He saw a 
man sitting on the cathedral 
steps, a man dressed all in rags. 
In front of him was a shapeless 
old hat and within the hat were 
two copper coins and a crust of 
bread. 
“A beggar,” Barthold grunted 
disgustedly. Still, perhaps . 
He looked closer and noticed 
the blank, vacuous expression in 
the beggar’s eyes, the slack jaw, 
the twisted, leering lips. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
“A great pity,” the monk said. 
“Hans Baerthaler received a 
head wound fighting against the 
Swedes at Fehrbellin and never 
recovered his senses. A terrible 
pity.” 
Barthold nodded, looking 
around at the empty cathedral 
square, the deserted streets. 
“Where is everyone?” he 
asked. 
“Why, sir, surely you must 
know! Everyone has fled Konigsberg except me and him. It is the 
Black Plague!” 
With a shudder, Barthold 
turned and raced back through 
the empty streets, to his Flipper, 
his antibiotics, and to any other 
year but this one. 
Xj^ITH a heavy heart and a 
** sense of impending failure, 
Barthold journeyed again down 
the years, to London, 1595. At 
Little Boar Taverne near Great 
Hertford Cross, he made inquiry 
of one Thomas Barthal. 
“And what would ye be wanting Barthal for?” asked the publican, in English so barbarous 
that Barthold could barely make 
it out. 
“I have business with him,” 
said Barthold in his hypnoed Old 
English. 
“Have you indeed?” The publican glanced up and down at 
Barthold’s ruffed finery. “Have 
you really now?” 
The tavern was a low, noisome 
place, lighted only by two guttering tallow candles. Its customers, who now gathered around 
Barthold and pressed close to 
him, looked like the lowest riffraff. They surrounded him, still 
gripping their pewter mugs, and 
Barthold detected, among their 
rags, the flash of keener metal. 
“A nark, eh?” 
“What in hell’s a nark doing 
in here?” 
“Daft, perhaps.” 
“Past a doubt, to come alone.” 
“And asking us to give um' 
poor Tom Barthal!” 
“We’ll give um something, 
lads!” 
“Ay, let’s give um!” 
The publican watched, grinning, as the ragged crowd advanced on Barthold, their pewter mugs held like maces. They 
backed him past the leaded windows, against the wall. And only 
then did Barthold fully realize 
the danger he faced in this unruly pack of vagabonds. 
“I’m no nark!” he cried. 
“The hell you say!” The mob 
pressed forward and a heavy mug 
crashed against the oak wall near 
his head. 
With a sudden inspiration, 
Barthold swept off his great 
plumed hat. “Look at me!” 
They stopped, gazing at him 
open-mouthed. 
“The perfect image of Tom 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
Barthal!” one gasped. 
“But Tom never said he had 
a brother,” another pointed out. 
“We were twins,” Barthold 
said rapidly, “separated at birth. 
I was raised in Normandy, Aquitaine and Cornwall. I found out 
only last month that I had a twin 
brother. And I’m here to meet 
him.” 
It was a perfectly creditable 
story for 16th century England 
and the resemblance could not be 
gainsaid. Barthold was brought 
to a table and a mug of ale set 
before him. 
“You’ve come late, lad,” an ancient one-eyed beggar told him. 
“A fine worker he was and a 
clever one at prigging a prancer — ” 
Barthold recognized the old 
term for horse thief. 
“ — but they took him at Aylesbury, and tried him with the 
hookers and the freshwater 
marines, and found him guilty, 
worse luck.” 
“What’s his fine?” Barthold 
asked. 
“A severe one,” said a stocky 
rogue. “They’re hanging him today at Shrew’s Marker!” 
13ARTHOLD sat very still for 
a moment. Then he asked, 
“Does my brother really look like 
me?” 
“The spitting image!” exclaimed the publican. “It’s uncan
90 
ny, man, and a thing to behold. 
Same looks, same height, same 
weight — everything the same!” 
The others nodded their agreement. And Barthold, so close to 
success, decided to risk all. He 
had to have Tom Barthal! 
“Now listen close to me, lads,” 
he said. “You have no love for 
the narks or the London law, do 
you? Well, I’m a rich man in 
France, a very rich man. Would 
you like to come there with me 
and live like barons? Aye, take 
it easy — I knew you would. Well, 
we can do it, boys. But we have 
to bring my brother, too.” 
“But how? asked a sturdy 
tinker. “They’re hanging him 
this day!” 
“Aren’t you men?” demanded 
Barthold. “Aren’t you armed? 
Wouldn’t you dare strike out 
for fortune and a life of ease?” 
They shouted their assent. 
Barthold said, “I thought you’d 
be keen. You can. All you have to 
do is follow my instructions.” 
Only a small crowd had gathered at Shrew’s Marker, for it was 
a small and insignificant hanging. 
Still, it afforded some amusement 
and the people cheered lustily as 
the horse-drawn prisoner’s wagon 
rumbled over the cobbled streets 
and drew to a halt in front of 
the gibbet. 
“There’s Tom,” murmured the 
tinker, at the edge of the crowd. 
“See him there?” 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
“I think so,” Barthold said. 
“Let’s move in.” 
He and his fifteen men pushed 
their way through the crowd, 
circling the gibbet. The hangman 
had already mounted the platform, had gazed over the crowd 
through the eye-slits in his black 
mask, and was now testing his 
rope. Two constables led Tom 
Barthal up the steps, positioned 
him, reached for the rope . 
“Are you ready?” the publican 
asked Barthold. “Hey! Are you 
ready?” 
Barthold was staring, openmouthed, at the man on the platform. The family resemblance 
was unmistakable. Tom Barthal 
looked exactly like him — except 
for one thing. 
Barthal’s cheeks and forehead 
were deeply pitted with smallpox 
scars. 
“Now’s the moment for the 
rush,” the publican said. “Are you 
ready, sir? Sir? Hey!” 
He whirled and saw a plumed 
hat duck out of sight into an alley. 
He started to give chase, but 
stopped abruptly. From the gibbet he heard a hiss, a stifled 
scream, a sodden thud. When he 
turned again, the plumed hat was 
out of sight. 
Everett Barthold returned to 
his Flipper, deeply depressed. A 
disfigured man would not fit his 
plan. 
TN the Flipper, Barthold 
thought long and seriously. 
Things were going badly, very 
badly indeed. He had searched 
through time, all the way to medieval London, and had found no 
Barthold he could use. Now he 
was nearing the thousand-year 
limit. 
He could go no further — 
Not legally. 
But legality was a matter of 
proof. He couldn’t— he wouldn’t— 
turn back now. 
There had to be a usable Barthold somewhere in time! 
He unlocked the small brown 
suitcase and took from it a small, 
heavy machine. He had paid several thousand dollars for it, back 
in Present Time. Now it was 
worth a lot more to him. 
He set the machine carefully 
and plugged it into the time 
clock. 
He was now free to go anywhere in time — back to primordial origins, if he wished. The 
time clock would not register. 
He reset the controls, feeling 
suddenly very lonely. It was a 
frightening thing to plunge over 
the thousand-year brink. For a 
single instant, Barthold considered giving up the entire dubious 
venture, returning to the security 
of his own time, his own wife, 
his own job. 
But, steeling himself, he jabbed 
the send-off button. 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
¥TE emerged in England, 662, 
near the ancient stronghold 
of Maiden Castle. Hiding the 
Flipper in a thicket, he emerged 
wearing a simple clothing of 
coarse linen. He took the road 
toward Maiden Castle, which he 
could see in the far distance, upon 
a rise of land. 
A group of soldiers passed him, 
drawing a cart. Within the cart, 
Barthold glimpsed the yellow 
glow of Baltic amber, red-glazed 
pottery from Gaul, and even 
Italian-looking candelabra. Loot, 
no doubt, Barthold thought, from 
the sack of some town. He wanted 
to question the soldiers, but they 
glared at him fiercely and he was 
glad to slink by unquestioned. 
Next he passed two men, 
stripped to the waist, chanting in 
Latin. The man behind was lashing the man in front with a cruel, 
many-stranded leather whip. And 
presently they changed positions, 
with barely the loss of a stroke. 
“I beg your pardon, sirs — ” 
But they wouldn’t even look at 
him.

I V if 
Barthold continued walking, 
mopping perspiration from his 
forehead. After a while, he overtook a cloaked man with a harp 
slung over one shoulder and a 
sword over the other. 
“Sir,” said Barthold, “might 
you know where I’d find a kinsman of mine, who has journeyed 
here from Iona? His name is Connor Lough mac Bairthre.” 
“I do,” the man stated. 
“Where?” asked Barthold. 
“Standing before you,” said the 
man. Immediately he stepped 
back, clearing his sword from its 
scabbard and slinging his harp 
to the grass. 
Fascinated, Barthold stared at 
Bairthre. He saw, beneath the 
long page-boy hair, an exact and 
unmistakable likeness of himself. 
At last he had found his man! 
But his man was acting most 
uncooperative. Advancing slowly, 
sword held ready for cut or slash, 
Bairthre commanded, “Vanish, 
demon, or I’ll carve you like a 
capon.” 
“I’m no demon!” Barthold 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
cried. “I’m a kinsman of yours!” 
“You lie,” Bairthre declared 
firmly. “I’m a wandering man, 
true, and a long time away from 
home. But still I remember every 
member of my family. You’re not 
one of them. So you must be a 
demon, taking my face for the 
purposes of enchantment.” 
“Wait!” Barthold begged as 
Bairthre’s forearm tensed for the 
stroke. “Have you ever given a 
thought to the future?” 
“The future?” 
“Yes, the future! Centuries 
from now!” 
“I’ve heard of that strange 
time, though I’m one who lives 
for today,” Bairthre said, slowly 
lowering his sword. “We had a 
stranger in Iona once, called himself a Cornishman when he was 
sober and a Life Photographer 
when he was drunk. Walked 
around clicking a toy box at 
things and muttering to himself. 
Fill him up with mead and he’d 
tell you all about times to come.” 
“That’s where I’m from,” Barthold said. “I’m a distant kinsman 
of yours from the future. And 
I’m here to offer you an enormous 
fortune!” 
Bairthre promptly sheathed 
his sword. “That’s very kind of 
you, kinsman,” he said civilly. 
“But, of course, it will call for 
considerable cooperation on your 
part.” 
“I feared as much,” Bairthre 
sighed. “Well, let’s hear about it, 
kinsman.” 
“Come with me,” Barthold said, 
and led the way to his Flipper. 
A LL the materials were ready 
in the brown suitcase. He 
knocked Bairthre out with a palm 
hypo, since the Irishman was 
showing signs of nervousness. 
Then, attaching frontal electrodes 
to Bairthre’s forehead, he hypnoed into him a quick outline of 
world history, a concise course 
in English and in American manners and customs. 
This took the better part of 
two days. Meanwhile, Barthold 
used the swiftgraft machine he 
had bought to transfer skin from 
his fingers to Bairthre’s. Now 
they had the same fingerprints. 
With normal cell-shedding, the 
prints would flake off in some 
months, revealing the original 
ones, but that wasn’t important. 
They did not have to be permanent. 
Then, using a checklist, Barthold added some identifying 
marks that Bairthre was lacking 
and removed some they didn’t 
share. An electrolysis job took 
care of the fact that Barthold was 
balding and his kinsman hadn’t 
been. 
When he was finished, Barthold 
pumped revitalizer into Bairthre’s 
veins and waited. 
In a short while, Bairthre 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
groaned, rubbed his hypno-stuffed 
head and said in modern English, “Oh, man! What did you hit 
me with?” 
“Don’t worry about it,” Barthold said. “Let’s get down to 
business.” 
Briefly he explained his plan 
for getting rich at the expense 
of the Inter-Temporal Insurance 
Corporation. 
“And they’ll actually pay?” 
Bairthre asked. 
“They will, if they can’t disprove the claim.” 
“And they will pay that 
much?” 
“Yes. I checked beforehand. 
The compensation for double 
indemnity is fantastically high.” 
“That’s the part I still don’t 
understand,” Bairthre said. “What 
is this double indemnity?” 
“It occurs,” Barthold told him, 
“when a man, traveling into the 
past, has the misfortune to pass 
through a mirror-flaw in the temporal structure. It’s a very rare 
occurrence. But when it happens, 
it’s catastrophic. One man has 
gone into the past, you see. But 
two perfectly identical men return.” 
“Oho!” said Bairthre. “So thafs 
double indemnity!” 
“That’s it. Two men, indistinguishable from each other, return 
from the past. Each feels that his 
is the true and original identity 
and that he is the only possible 
claimant of his property, business, 
wife and so forth. No coexistence 
is possible between them. One of 
them must forfeit all rights, leave 
his present, his home, wife, business, and go into the past to live. 
The other remains in his own 
time, but lives with constant 
fear, apprehension, guilt.” 
"DARTHOLD paused for 
breath. “So you see,” he continued, “under the circumstances, 
double indemnity represents a 
calamity of the first order. Therefore, both parties are compensated accordingly.” 
“Hmm,” said Bairthre, thinking hard. “Has this happened 
often, this double indemnity?” 
“Less than a dozen times in 
the history of time travel. There 
are precautions against it, such 
as staying out of Paradox Points 
and respecting the thousand-year 
barrier.” 
“You traveled more than a 
thousand years,” Bairthre pointed 
out. 
“I accepted the risk and won.” 
“But, look, if there’s so much 
money in this double indemnity 
thing, why haven’t others tried 
it?” 
Barthold smiled wryly. “It’s 
not as easy as it sounds. I’ll tell 
you about it sometime. But now 
to business. Are you in this with 
me?” 
“I could be a baron with that 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
money,” Bairthre said dreamily. 
“A king, perhaps, in Ireland! I’m 
in this with you.” 
“Fine. Sign this.” 
“What is it?” Bairthre asked, 
frowning at the legal-looking 
document that Barthold had 
thrust before him. 
“It simply states that, upon receiving adequate compensation 
as set by the Inter-Temporal Insurance Corporation, you will go 
at once to a past of your own 
choosing and there remain, waiving any and all rights to the 
Present. Sign it as Everett Barthold. I’ll fill in the date later.” 
“But the signature — ” Bairthre 
began to object, then halted and 
grinned. “Through hypno-learning, I know about hypno-learning 
and what it can do, including the 
fact that you didn’t have to give 
me the answers to my questions. 
As soon as I asked them, I knew 
the explanations. The mirror-flaw, 
too, by the way — that’s why you 
hypnoed me into being lefthanded and left-eyed. And, of 
course, the grafted fingerprints 
go the opposite way, the same 
as if you saw them in a mirror.” 
“Correct,” said Barthold. “Any 
other questions?” 
“None I can think of at the 
moment. I don’t even have to 
compare our signatures. I know 
they’ll be identical, except — ” 
Again he paused and looked 
angry. “That’s a lousy trick! I’ll 
be writing backward!” 
Barthold smiled. “Naturally. 
How else would you be a mirrorimage of me? And just in case 
you decide you like my time better than yours and try to have 
me sent back, remember the precautions I took beforehand. 
They’re good enough to send you 
to the Prison Planetoid for life.” 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
He handed the document to 
Bairthre. 
“You don’t take any chances, 
do you?” Bairthre said, signing. 
“I try to cover all eventualities. It’s my home and my present 
that we’re going to and I plan 
to keep possession. Come on. You 
need a haircut and a general going-over.” 
1%/|’AVIS Barthold didn’t have 
to worry about overacting. 
When two Everett Bartholds 
walked in the front door, wearing 
identical garments, with the same 
expression of nervous embarrassment, and when two Everett Bartholds said, “Er, Mavis, this will 
take a little explaining . .” 
It was just too much. Foreknowledge acted as no armor. She 
shrieked, threw her arms in the 
air and fainted. 
Later, when her two husbands 
had revived her, she regained 
some composure. “You did it, 
Everett!” she said. “Everett?” 
“That’s me,” said Barthold. 
“Meet my kinsman, Connor 
Lough mac Bairthre.” 
“At your service, madame,” 
Bairthre said. 
“It’s unbelievable!” cried Mrs. 
Barthold. 
“Then, we look alike?” her husband asked. 
“Exactly alike. Just exactly!” 
“From now on,” said Barthold, 
“think of us both as Everett Barthold. The insurance investigators 
will be watching you. Remember 
— either of us, or both, could be 
your husband. Treat us exactly 
alike.” 
“As you wish, my dear,” Mavis 
said demurely. 
Side by side, the identicallooking men walked to the Flipper. 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
“Except, of course, for the matter of — I mean except in the 
area of — of — Damn it all. Mavis, 
can’t you really tell which one of 
us is me?” 
“Of course I can, dear,” Mavis 
said. “A wife always knows her 
husband.” And she gave Bairthre 
a quick look, which he returned 
with interest. 
“I’m glad to hear it,” said Barthold. “Now I must contact the 
insurance company.” He hurried 
into the other room. 
“So you’re a relative of my husband,” Mavis said to Bairthre. 
“How alike you look!” 
“But I’m really quite different,” 
Bairthre assured her. 
“Are you? You look so like 
him! I wonder if you really can 
be different.” 
“I’ll prove it to you.” 
“How?” 
“By singing you a song of ancient Ireland,” Bairthre said, and 
proceeded at once in a fine, high 
tenor voice. 
It wasn’t quite what Mavis 
had in mind. But she realized 
that anyone so like her husband 
would have to be obtuse about 
some things. 
And from the other room, she 
could hear Barthold saying, “Hello, Inter-Temporal Insurance Corporation? Mr. Gryns, please. Mr. 
Gryns? This is Everett Barthold. 
Something rather unfortunate 
seems to have happened . .” 
*^HERE was consternation at 
the offices of the Inter-Temporal Insurance Corporation, and 
confusion, and dismay, and a 
swift telephoning of underwriters, 
when two Everett Bartholds 
walked in, with identical nervous 
little smiles. 
“First case of its kind in fifteen years,” said Mr. Gryns. “Oh, 
Lord! You will submit, of course, 
to a full examination?” 
“Of course,” said Barthold. 
“Of course,” said Barthold. 
The doctors poked and probed 
them. They found differences, 
which they carefully listed with 
long Latin terms. But all the differences were within the normal 
variation range for temporal identicals and no amount of juggling 
on paper could change that. So 
the company psychiatrists took 
over. 
Both men responded to all 
questions with careful slowness. 
Bairthre kept his wits about him 
and his nerve intact. Using his 
hypnoed knowledge of Barthold, 
he answered the questions slowly but well, exactly as did Barthold. 
Inter-Temporal engineers 
checked the time clock in the 
Flipper. They dismantled it and 
put it back together again. They 
examined the controls, set for 
Present, 1912, 1869, 1676, and 
1595. 662 had also been punched 
— illegally — but the time clock 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
showed that it had not been activated. Barthold explained that 
he had hit the control accidentally and thought it best to leave 
it alone. 
It was suspicious, but not actionable. 
A lot of power had been used, 
the engineers pointed out. But 
the time clock showed stops only 
to 1595. They brought the time 
clock back to the lab for further 
investigation. 
The engineers then went over 
the interior of the Flipper inch 
by inch, but could find nothing 
incriminating. Barthold had taken 
the precaution of throwing the 
brown suitcase and its contents 
into the English Channel before 
leaving the year 662. 
Mr. Gryns offered a settlement, 
which the two Bartholds turned 
down. He offered two more, 
which were refused. And, finally, 
he admitted defeat. 
The last conference was held 
in Gryns’ office. The two Bartholds sat on either side of Gryns’ 
desk, looking slightly bored with 
the entire business. Gryns looked 
like a man whose neat and predictable world has been irrevocably upset. 
“I just can’t understand it,” he 
said. “In the years you traveled 
in, sirs, the odds against a time 
flaw are something like a million 
to one!” 
“I guess we’re that one,” said 
Barthold, and Bairthre nodded. 
“But somehow it just doesn’t 
seem — well, what’s done is done. 
Have you gentlemen decided the 
question of your coexistence?” 
OARTHOLD handed Gryns 
the paper that Bairthre had 
signed in 662. “He is going to 
leave, immediately upon receipt 
of his compensation.” 
“Is this satisfactory to you, 
sir?” Gryns as’jced Bairthre. 
“Sure,” said Bairthre. “I don’t 
like it here anyhow.” 
“Sir?” 
“I mean,” Bairthre said hastily, 
“what I mean is, I’ve always 
wanted to get away, you know, 
secret desire, live in some quiet 
spot, nature, simple people, all 
that . .” 
“I see,” Mr. Gryns said dubiously. “And do you feel that 
way, sir?” he asked, turning to 
Barthold. 
“Certainly,” Barthold asserted. 
“I have the same secret desires 
he has. But one of us has to stay 
— sense of duty, you know — and 
I’ve agreed to remain.” 
“I see,” Gryns said. But his 
tone made it clear that he didn’t 
see at all. “Hah. Well. Your 
checks are being processed now, 
gentlemen. A purely mechanical 
procedure. They can be picked up 
tomorrow morning — always assuming that no proofs of fraud 
are presented to us before then.” 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
The atmosphere was suddenly 
icy. The two Bartholds said goodby to Mr. Gryns and left very 
quickly. 
They rode the elevator down in 
silence. Outside the building, 
Bairthre said, “Sorry about that 
slip about not liking it here.” 
"Shut up!” 
“Huh?” 
Barthold seized Bairthre by the 
arm and dragged him into an automatic heli, taking care not to 
choose the first empty one he 
saw. 
He punched for Westchester, 
then looked back to see if they 
were being followed. When he 
was certain they were not, he 
checked the interior of the heli 
for camera or recording devices. 
At last he turned to speak to 
Bairthre. 
“You utter damned fool! That 
boner could have cost us a fortune!” 
“I’ve been doing the best I 
can,” Bairthre said sullenly. 
“What’s wrong now? Oh, you 
mean they suspect.” 
“That’s what’s wrong! Gryns 
is undoubtedly having us followed. If they can find anything — 
anything at all to upset our claim 
— it could mean the Prison 
Planetoid.” 
“We’ll have to watch our steps,” 
said Bairthre soberly. 
“I’m glad you realize it,” Barthold said. 
^ I HEY dined quietly in a WestChester restaurant and had 
several drinks. This put them in 
a better frame of mind. They 
were feeling almost happy when 
they returned to Barthold’s house 
and sent the heli back to the city. 
“We will sit and play cards 
tonight,” said Barthold, “and talk, 
and drink coffee, and behave as 
though we both were Barthold. 
In the morning. I’ll go collect our 
checks.” 
“Good enough,” Bairthre 
agreed. “I’ll be glad to get back. 
I don’t see how you can stand 
it with iron and stone all around 
you. Ireland, man! A king in Ireland, that’s what I’ll be!” 
“Don’t talk about it now.” Barthold opened the door and they 
entered. 
“Good evening, dear,” Mavis 
said, looking at a pioint exactly 
midway between them. 
“I thought you said you knew 
me,” Barthold commented sourly. 
“Of course I do, darling,” Mavis 
said, turning to him with a bright 
smile. “I just didn’t want to insult poor Mr. Bairthre.” 
“Thank you, kind lady,” said 
Bairthre. “Perhaps I’ll sing you 
another song of ancient Ireland 
later.” 
“That would be lovely, I’m 
sure,” Mavis said. “A man telephoned you, dear. He’ll call later. 
Honey, I’ve been looking at ads 
for scart fur. The Polar Martian 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
Scart is a bit more expensive than 
plain Canal Martian Scart, but—” 
“A man called?” Barthold 
asked. “Who?” 
“He didn’t say. Anyhow, it 
wears much better and the fur 
has that iridescent sheen that 
only — ” 
“Mavis! What did he want?” 
“It was something about the 
double indemnity claim,” she 
said. “But that’s all settled, isn’t 
it?” 
“It is not settled until I have 
the check in my hand,” Barthold 
told her. “Now tell me exactly 
what he said.” 
“Well, he told me he was calling about your so-called claim on 
the Inter-Temporal Insurance 
Corporation — ” 
“ ‘So-called?’ Did he say ‘socalled’?” 
“Those were his exact words. 
So-called claim on the Inter-Temporal Insurance Corporation. He 
said he had to speak to you immediately, before morning.” 
Barthold’s face had turned 
gray. “Did he say he’d phone 
back?” 
“He said he’d call in person.” 
“What is it?” Bairthre asked. 
“What does it mean? Of course 
— an insurance investigator!” 
“That’s right,” Barthold said. 
“He must have found something.” 
“But what?” 
“How should I know? Let me 
think!” 
* 
A T that moment, the doorbell 
rang. The three Bartholds 
looked at each other dumbly. 
The doorbell rang again. “Open 
up, Barthold!” a voice called. 
“Don’t try to duck me!” 
“Can we kill him?” Bairthre 
asked. 
“Too complicated,” said Barthold, after a little thought. 
“Come on! Out the back way!” 
“But why?” 
“The Flipper’s parked there. 
We’re going into the past! Don’t 
you see? If he had proof, he’d 
have given it to the insurance 
people already. So he only suspects. He probably thinks he can 
trip us up with questions. If we 
can keep away from him until 
morning, we’re safe!” 
“What about me?” Mavis 
quavered. 
“Stall him,” Barthold said, 
dragging Bairthre out the back 
door and into the Flipper. The 
doorbell was jangling insistently 
as Barthold slammed the Flipper’s door and turned to the controls. 
Then he realized that the Inter-Temporal engineers had not 
returned his time clock. 
He was lost, lost. Without the 
time clock, he couldn’t take the 
Flipper anywhere. For an instant, 
he was in a complete state of 
panic. Then he regained control 
of himself and tried to think the 
problem through. 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
His controls were still set for 
Present, 1912, 1869, 1676, 1595 
and 662. Therefore, even without 
the time clock, he could activate any of those dates manually. Flying without a time clock 
was a federal offense, but to hell 
with that. 
Quickly he stabbed 1912 and 
worked the controls. Outside, he 
heard his wife shrieking. Heavy 
footsteps were pounding through 
his house. 
“Stop! Stop, you!” the man was 
shouting. 
And then Barthold was surrounded by a filmy, never-ending 
grayness as the Flipper speeded 
down the years. 
"D ARTHOLD parked the Flipper on the Bowery. He and 
Bairthre went into a saloon, ordered a nickel beer apiece and 
worked on the free lunch. 
“Damned nosy investigator,” 
Barthold muttered. “Well, we’ve 
shaken him now. I’ll have to pay 
a stiff fine for joyriding a Flipper 
with no time clock. But I’ll be 
able to afford it.” 
“It’s all moving too fast for 
me,” said Bairthre, downing a 
great gulp of beer. Then he shook 
his head and shrugged. “I was 
just going to ask you how going 
into the past would help us collect our checks in the morning 
in your present. But I realize I 
know the answer.” 
“Of course. It’s the elapsed time 
that counts. If we can stay hidden in the past for twelve hours 
or so, we’ll arrive in my time 
twelve hours later than we left. 
Prevents all sorts of accidents, 
such as arriving just as you depart, or even before. Routine traffic precautions.” 
Bairthre munched a salami 
sandwich. “The hypno-learning is 
a little sketchy about the time 
trip. Where are we?” 
“New York, 1912. A very interesting era.” 
“I just want to go home. What 
are those big men in blue?” 
“They’re policemen,” Barthold 
said. “They seem to be looking 
for someone.” 
Two mustached policemen had 
entered the saloon, followed by 
an enormously fat man in inkstained clothes. 
“There they are!” shouted Bully Jack Barthold. “Arrest them 
twins, officers!” 
“What is all this?” inquired 
Everett Barthold. 
“That your jalopy outside?” 
one of the policemen asked. 
“Yes, sir, but - ” 
“That clinches it, then. Man’s 
got a warrant out for you two. 
Said you’d have a shiny new 
jalopy. Offering a nice reward, 
too.” 
“The guy came straight to me,” 
said Bully Jack. “I told him I’d 
be real happy to help— though I’d 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
rather take a poke at him, the 
lousy, insinuating, dirty — ” 
“Officers,” Barthold pleaded, 
“we haven’t done anything!” 
“Then you got nothing to fear. 
Come along quiet now.” 
Barthold plunged suddenly 
past the policemen, shoved Bully 
Jack in the face and was in the 
street. Bairthre, who had been 
considering the same thing, 
stomped hard on one policeman’s 
foot, jabbed another in the 
stomach, rammed Bully Jack out 
of his way and followed on Barthold’s heels. 
They leaped into the Flipper 
and Barthold jabbed for 1869. 
T hey concealed the Flipper 
as well as they could, in a 
backstreet livery stable, and 
walked to a little park nearby. 
They opened their shirts to the 
warm Memphis sunlight and lay 
back on the grass. 
“That investigator must have 
a supercharged time job,” Barthold said. “That’s why he’s reaching our stops before us.” 
“How does he know where 
we’re going?” Bairthre asked. 
“Our stops are a matter of 
company record. He knows we 
haven’t got a time clock, so these 
are the only places we can 
reach.” 
“Then we aren’t safe here,” 
said Bairthre. “He’s probably 
looking for us.” 
“Probably he is,” Barthold* 
said wearily. “But he hasn’t 
caught us yet. Just a few more 
hours and we’re safe! It’ll be 
morning in the Present and the 
check will have gone through.” 
“Is that a fact, gentlemen?” 
a suave voice inquired. 
Barthold looked up and saw 
Ben Bartholder standing before 
him, a small derringer balanced 
in his good left hand. 
“So he offered you the reward, 
too!” Barthold said. 
“He did indeed. And a most 
tempting offer, let me say. But 
I’m not interested in it.” 
“You’re not?” Bairthre said. 
“No. I’m interested in only one 
thing. I want to know which of 
you walked out on me last night 
in the saloon.” 
Barthold and Bairthre stared 
at each other, then back at Ben 
Bartholder. 
“I want that one,” Bartholder 
said. “Nobody insults Ben Bartholder. Even with one hand, I’m 
as good a man as any! I want 
that man. The other can go.” 
Barthold and Bairthre stood 
up. Bartholder stepped back in 
order to cover them both. 
“Which is it, gents? I don’t 
possess a whole lot of patience.” 
He stood before them, weaving slightly, looking as mean and 
efficient as a rattlesnake. Barthold decided that the derringer 
was too far away for a rush. It 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
probably had a hair-trigger, anyhow. 
“Speak up!” Bartholder said 
sharply. “Which of you is it?” 
^ I ''HINKING desperately, Barthold wondered why Ben Bartholder hadn’t fired yet, why he 
hadn’t simply killed them both. 
Then he figured it out and immediately knew his only course 
of action. 
“Everett,” he said. 
“Yes, Everett?” said Bairthre. 
“We’re going to turn around together now and walk back to the 
Flipper.” 
“But the gun — ” 
“He won’t shoot. Are you with 
me?” 
“With you,” Bairthre said 
through clenched teeth. 
They turned, like soldiers in 
a march, and began to pace slowly back toward the livery stable. 
“Stop!” Ben Bartholder cried. 
“Stop or I’ll shoot you both!” 
“No, you won’t!” Barthold 
shouted back. They were in the 
street now, approaching the livery 
stable. 
“No? You think I don’t dare?” 
“It isn’t that,” Barthold said, 
walking toward the Flipper. 
“You’re just not the type to shoot 
down a perfectly innocent man. 
And one of us is innocent!” 
Slowly, carefully, Bairthre 
opened the Flipper’s door. 
“I don’t care!” Bartholder 
yelled. “Which one? Speak up, 
you miserable coward! Which 
one? I’ll give you a fair fight. 
Speak up or I’ll shoot you both 
here and now!” 
“And what would the boys 
say?” Barthold scoffed. “They’d 
say that the one-handed man lost 
his nerve and killed two unarmed 
strangers!” 
Ben Bartholder’s iron gun hand 
sagged. 
“Quick, get in,” Barthold whispered. 
They scrambled in and 
slammed the door. Bartholder put 
the derringer away. 
“All right, mister,” Ben Bartholder said. “You been here 
twice and I think you’ll be here 
a third time. I’ll wait around. 
The next time I’ll get you.” 
He turned and walked away. 
^ I ''HEY had to get out of Memphis. But where could they 
go? Barthold wouldn’t consider 
Konigsberg, 1676, and the Black 
Death. London, 1595, was filled 
with Tom Barthal’s criminal 
friends, any of whom would 
cheerfully cut Barthold’s throat 
for treachery. 
“We’ll go all the way back,” 
Bairthre said. “To Maiden’s 
Castle.” 
“And if he comes there?” 
“He won’t. It’s against the law 
to go past the thousand-year 
limit. And would an insurance 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
man break the law?” 
“He might not,” Barthold said 
thoughtfully. “He just might not. 
It’s worth a try.” 
And again he activated the 
Flipper. 
They slept in an open field 
that night, a mile from the 
Fortress of Maiden’s Castle. They 
stayed beside the Flipper and 
took turns at sentry duty. And 
finally the sun rose, warm and 
yellow, above the green fields. 
“He didn’t come,” Bairthre 
said. 
“What?” Barthold asked, waking with a start. 
“Snap out of it, man! We’re 
safe. Is it morning yet in your 
Present?” 
“It’s morning,” Barthold said, 
rubbing his eyes. 
“Then we’ve won and I’ll be a 
king in Ireland!” 
“Yes, we’ve won,” Barthold 
said. “Victory at last is — damn!” 
“What’s the matter?” 
“That investigator! Look over 
there!” 
Bairthre stared across the 
fields, muttering, “I don’t see a 
thing. Are you sure — ” 
Barthold struck him across the 
back of the skull with a stone. 
He had picked it up during the 
night and saved it for this purpose. 
He bent over and felt 
Bairthre’s pulse. The Irishman 
still lived, but would be uncon
scious for a few hours. When he 
recovered, he would be alone and 
kingdomless. 
Too bad, Barthold thought. But 
under the circumstances, it would 
be risky to bring Bairthre back 
with him. How much easier it 
would be to walk up to InterTemporal himself and collect a 
check for Everett Barthold. Then 
return in half an hour and collect another check for Everett 
Barthold. 
And how much more profitable it would be! 
He climbed into the Flipper 
and looked once more at his unconscious kinsman. What a 
shame, he thought, that he will 
never be a king in Ireland. 
But then, he thought, history 
would probably find it confusing 
if he had succeeded. 
He activated the controls, 
headed straight for the Present. 
TTE reappeared in the back 
yard of his house. Quickly 
he bounded up the steps and 
pounded on the door. 
“Who’s there?” Mavis called. 
“Me!” Barthold shouted. “It’s 
all right. Mavis — everything has 
worked out fine!” 
“Who?” Mavis opened the 
door, stared at him, and let out 
a shriek. 
“Calm down,” Barthold said. 
“I know it’s been a strain, but 
it’s all over now. I’m going for 
DOUBLE INDEMNITY 
the check and then we’ll — ” 
He stopped. A man had just 
appeared in the doorway beside 
Mavis. He was a short man, beginning to bald, his features ordinary, and his eyes were mild 
behind horn-rimmed glasses. 
It was himself. 
“Oh, no!” Barthold groaned. 
“Oh, yes,” his double said. “One 
cannot venture beyond the thousand-year barrier with impunity, 
Everett. Sometimes there is a 
sound reason for a law. I am your 
time-identical.” 
Barthold stared at the Barthold 
in the doorway. He said, “I was 
chased — ” 
“By me,” his double told him. 
“In disguise, of course, since you 
have a few enemies in time. You 
imbecile, why did you run?” 
“I thought you were an investigator. Why were you chasing 
me?” 
“For one reason and one reason 
only.” 
“What was that?” 
“We could have been rich beyond our wildest dreams,” his 
double said, “if only you hadn’t 
been so guilty and frightened! 
The three of us — you, Bairthre 
and me — could have gone to Inter-Temporal and claimed triple 
indemnity!” 
“Triple indemnity!” Barthold 
breathed. “I never thought of it.” 
“The sum would have been 
staggering. It would have been 
infinitely more than for double 
indemnity. You disgust me.” 
“Well,” Barthold said, “what’s 
done is done. At least we can 
collect for double indemnity, then 
decide — ” 
“I collected both checks and 
signed the release forms for you. 
You weren’t here, you know.” 
“In that case, I’d like my 
share.” 
“Don’t be ridiculous,” his 
double told him. 
“But it’s mine! I’ll go to InterTemporal and tell them — ” 
“They won’t listen. I’ve waived 
all your rights. You can’t even 
stay in the Present, Everett.” 
“Don’t do this to me!” Barthold begged. 
“Why not? Look at what you 
did to Bairthre.” 
“Damn it, you can’t judge me!” 
Barthold cried. “Yot/re me!” 
“Who else is there to judge 
you except yourself?” his double 
asked him. 
B arthold couldn’t cope 
with that. He turned to 
Mavis. 
“Darling,” he said, “you always 
told me you’d know your own 
husband. Don’t you know me 
now?” 
Mavis moved back into the 
house. As she went, Barthold 
noticed the flash of ruumstones 
around her neck and asked no 
more. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
Barthold and Barthold stood 
face to face. The double raised 
his arm. A police heli, hovering 
low, dropped to the ground. 
Three policemen piled out. 
“This is what I was afraid of, 
officers,” the double said. '‘My 
double collected his check this 
morning, as you know. He waived 
his rights and went into the past. 
I was afraid he’d return and try 
for more.” 
“He won’t bother you a^oin, 
sir,” a policeman said. He tufued 
to Barthold. “You! Climb hack 
in that Flipper and get out of the 
Present. The next time we see 
you, we shoot!” 
Barthold knew when he was 
beaten. Very humbly, he said, 
“I’ll gladly go, officers. But 
Flipper needs repairs. It doesn’t 
have a time clock.” 
“You should have thought 
about that before signing the 
waiver,” the policeman said. '‘Get 
moving!” 
“Please!” Barthold said. 
“No,” Barthold answered. 
No mercy. And Barthold knew 
that, in his double’s place, he 
would have said exactly the same 
thing. 
He climbed into the Flipper 
and closed the door. Numbly he 
contemplated his choices, if they 
could be called that. 
New York, 1912, with its maddening reminders of his own time 
and with Bully Jack Barthold? 
Or Memphis, 1869, with Ben Bartholder awaiting his third visit? 
Or Konigsberg, 1676, with the 
grinning, vacant face of Hans 
Baerthaler for company, and the 
Black Death? Or London, 1595, 
with Tom Barthal’s cutthroat 
friends searching the streets for 
him? Or Maiden’s Castle, 662, 
with an angry Connor Lough mac 
Bairthre waiting to even the 
score? 
It really didn’t matter. This 
time, he thought, let the place 
pick me. 
He closed his eyes and blindly stabbed a button.

DOUBLE INDEMNItY 
ROBOTS ARE NICE 
By GORDON R. DICKSON 
To Jim Harvey, robots were not 
a bit nice — they had something 
up their sleeve valves — and it 
was a matter of make or brake! 
illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 
T he home robofax in the 
wall of Jim Harvey’s 
apartment living room 
clicked once and slid a letter out 
onto the table. It was a letter 
with Jim Harve3r’s name and return address on it and addressed 
to The Dunesville Robocourier, 
Editorial Page Section. A polite 
note was clipped to it. The note 
read: 
Because of insufficient space in 
our Readers Column, we are regret
GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
fully returning your letter to the 
editor. 
“Ha!” said Jim Harvey. He was 
a young man with blond hair, a 
crooked nose and a wild light in 
his eye. He sat on his living room 
couch with a martini glass in his 
hand. 
“Tut-tut!” said the roboannunciator on the wall, in gently reproving tones. 
“Censorship!” snarled Jim. 
“No, no,” said the robovision 
set in the corner of the room, in a 
hurt voice. “You don’t mean that, 
Jim.” 
“I do, too!” Jim drained his 
glass. “Give me another martini.” 
The home robobartender glided 
across the carpet to oblige. 
“But robots are nice,” said 
the robovision, quoting the roboteachers’ manual on the 
instruction of young humans from 
nursery school through college. 
“Don’t give me that.” Jim 
watched the robobartender pour 
his glass full. “I know what you’re 
up to. You don’t fool me. I know 
I’m the only sane man left in 
the world. I squeezed that information out of the robopollsters 
last week, remember? You’ve 
forced everybody else—” 
“We have not! cried the roborecordplayer abruptly from its 
niche beside the couch. “Robots 
never force anybody. It’s expressly forbidden.” 
“It is a prime command,” asserted the robothermostat, rather 
primly. “Are you warm enough?” 
it added, concerned. 
“No,” said Jim nastily. “It’s at 
least two-tenths of a degree too 
cold in here.” 
“I’ll fix it in a second,” promised the robothermostat. 
J IM gulped moodily at his martini, wondering what else he 
could do to keep the robots busy. 
“All we do,” said the robovision, “is persuade people—” 
“Brain-washing!” growled Jim. 
“—that robots are nice,” put 
in the roboannunciator. “There’s 
someone coming up your front 
walk. It’s your fiancee, Nancy 
Pluffer. Now she’s going away 
again. I turned on the Not At 
Home sign,” it concluded smugly. 
“Turn it off again!” yelped Jim. 
“Too late,” said the roboannunciator. “She’s left.” 
Jim cursed bitterly and picked 
up his fresh martini. 
“If you’d just stop drinking for 
a little while,” said the robovision, “we could make you much 
happier and better adjusted.” 
“Why do you think I do it?” 
challenged Jim. “You can’t give 
me psychiatric treatment when 
I’m under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Prime command. 
Right?” 
“Right,” said the robovision 
sadly. 
ROBOTS ARE NICE? 
“Well,” Jim said, poking at the 
olive in his martini with a swizzle 
stick, “what now? You barred 
me from using the newspaper facsimile letter columns to fight 
back at you and warn the world.” 
“No such thing. It just happened that four thousand nine 
hundred and seventeen letters 
came in the morning mail just 
before yours did. Naturally, that’s 
more than can be published in 
the six-month limit and we had 
to return yours.” It sighed. “If 
you’d only relax for a minute. 
Would you like to watch a girlie 
show? The Squidgy Hour is on 
the air right now.” 
“No!” 
“You’re not very cooperative.” 
“You’re darn right I’m not very 
cooperative.” Jim got up, ran a 
hand through his somewhat tousled hair and headed for the 
front door. “I’m going out where 
I can get some privacy. Maybe 
I’ll even find a publisher for my 
M.A. thesis on robosociology. 
Where’s my cape?” 
“In the closet,” said the robobutler. “Oh, Jim, if you’d only 
never written that thesis!” 
“You’d have liked that, 
wouldn’t you? Ha!” Jim said, 
fumbling in the closet. “If I hadn’t 
looked into the situation, I’d 
never have suspected what you 
were up to, trying to dominate 
the human — Let go of me!” 
barked Jim, slapping the robo
butler away. “I can put on my 
own cape! — And don’t think 
you’ve heard the last of that, 
either,” he said, turning to the 
front door. “You incinerated my 
only copy, but I’ve still got it 
locked up here in my head— This 
door won’t open.” 
ffOUT we only want you to 
^ be happy!” pleaded the 
robobutler. 
“This door’s stuck,” Jim said, 
yanking at the knob. 
“No, it’s locked,” said the roboannunciator. 
“Open it.” 
“I won’t!” the roboannunciator 
replied sulkily. 
“I order you to open it! You 
have to open on command. That’s 
a prime command!” 
“Yes, but what command?” 
asked the roboannunciator. “The 
roborepairservice was out while 
you were gone yesterday and rewired me. It takes a new sort 
of command to open me now and 
I’m rewired so that I can’t tell 
you what it is. Guess.” 
“Now you’ve gone too far — 
locking me in my own home! I’ll 
teach you! I’ll show you all!” He 
headed for the kitchen. “I’ll disconnect you!” 
“Jim, don’t!” begged the robobutler, rolling after him. “Jim, 
stop and think—” 
“Ha!” said Jim, throwing open 
the door of a cabinet set flush 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
with the kitchen’s glastile wall. 
“I’ll yank the master switch and 
—who in hell stole my master 
switch?” 
“There’s a red tag on the door 
handle,” the robobutler pointed 
out. 
Jim jerked it loose and held 
it up to look at it. Neatly printed 
on the red surface were the 
words: 
UNIT REMOVED FOR 
INVESTIGATION OF 
POSSIBLE MALFUNCTION. 
ROBOREPAIRSERVICE 
“No!” roared Jim. He ran back 
through the house to the living 
room. 
In front of the ornamental 
fireplace was a heavy brass-handled ornamental poker. Snatching it up, he turned and brought 
it down with a crash on the robobutler which had hastily followed 
at his heels. 
“Awk!” went the robobutler 
and collapsed into junk. 
“Stop it, Jim!” cried the robobartender, whizzing forward. 
“You don’t know what you’re 
do-” 
Crash! 
“Help!” yelled the robovision. 
“Calling roborepairservice! Calling roborepairservice! Malicious 
robocide taking place at 40 Wilderleaf Drive. Calling—” 
Smash! 
J IM raged through his house, 
wrecking and destroying. The 
roboannunciator required several 
swings, since most of its circuits 
were protected by inner walls. 
The roborefrigerator resisted for 
a good eighteen seconds through 
sheer bulk and the robosweeper 
hid behind the couch, but was 
quickly hunted down. The robohomeconditioner was too massive 
to be destroyed properly, but the 
robothermostat perished in a 
single shower of glass and small 
parts. Finally, in a home at last 
fallen silent, Jim finished up by 
knocking out a picture window 
and crawling through it to the 
lawn. 
“Stop!” called a new voice. 
“Halt in the name of the roborepairservice!” 
Jim turned about. A robomechanic was trundling up to him, 
its waldoes outstretched to grab 
him. Jim picked up the poker, 
dodged its initial rush— every robomechanic was notoriously slow 
on its treads— and with a wellplaced swing disabled its rear 
bogies. Hamstrung, it lurched to 
a halt and he bashed in its robobrain with a single two-handed 
blow. It fell silent— but robodoors 
were swinging open at neighboring houses and robovoices raised 
in alarm. 
Jim turned and ran. 
Several blocks away, panting, 
he came to a halt. He had, he

saw, outrun the hue and cry. He 
was over on Wilder Way, at a 
bus stop. 
“May I be of service?” 
A robobus had just rolled up 
to the curb. It was one of the 
smallest— a three-seater— but even 
at that, Jim almost took to his 
heels again before he realized 
that the vehicle was making no 
hostile move, but merely standing 
and waiting, in the time-honored 
manner of all robobuses. 
“Why, yes,” he said craftily. 
He hesitated and then got in. 
“Duschane and Pierce.” 
“Yes, sir.” The minibus closed 
its doors and rolled on in blissful 
ignorance, clicking the milage 
off on its meter. Jim chortled internally. He had had no plan until the bus had come up to him— 
after all, he was pretty isolated 
out in the suburbs and it would 
not have been hard for the robots 
to run him down. 
But now . 
He took the bus across town 
and got off at the junction of Duschane and Pierce Streets. Then 
he doubled back toward downtown through rear alleys for eight 
blocks until he came to a small 
house on a quiet residential 
street. 
Miss Nancy Pluffer — Not At 
Home read the illuminated sign 
above the front door. Jim chortled 
again and went around to the 
back. 
HE house appeared to be 
slumbering. The windows 
were opaqued and no sound or 
movement could be heard from 
without. Jim circled the place, 
being very careful to alert no 
robosensitive device. Then he 
considered. He knew which were 
the windows of Nancy’s bedroom 
and went around to them. These 
were also opaqued, but open a 
crack, since Nancy liked air. He 
pushed one up and crawled 
through. He stood up in the darkened bedroom. 
There was someone in the bed. 
Jim blinked — and then, as his 
expanding pupils adjusted to the 
dim light, saw that it was Nancy, 
evidently taking an afternoon 
nap. He went softly across the 
carpet to the bedside and whispered in her ear. 
“Wake up!” 
She stirred, yawned and looked 
up — and opened her mouth to 
scream. 
“Shh!” Jim hissed frantically, 
putting his hand over her mouth. 
Recognition crept in to drive 
out her alarm. Jim took his hand 
away and she sat up in bed with 
blonde hair tumbling around her 
shoulders and a pleased expression on her pretty face. 
“Jim!” she said. “Why, this is 
just like the private eye in The 
Robosnatchets.” 
“Never mind that.” The brusqueness of his own voice, echoing 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
in the shadowy silence of the bedroom, took him by surprise, and 
he realized with a start that the 
day’s earlier martinis were wearing off under the abrasive edge 
of his present tension and excitement. “This is a matter of — 
well, life or death, as a matter of 
fact. I want to talk to you. But 
hold on a minute — got anything 
to drink around?” 
“In the living room.” 
“Get me a drink — wait! Go 
get it yourself. Don’t ring for the 
robobartender. Are any of your 
robots on?” 
“Why, no,” Nancy said. “I 
pulled the master switch so I 
could nap without anybody disturbing me.” She gave a little 
squeal. “Isn’t this exciting?” 
“No,” said Jim. “Now listen to 
me. Don’t turn anything on. 
You’ve got that? Nothing. Leave 
everything off. Just go to the living room, get me a double shot 
of something and bring it back 
here by yourself. Got it?” 
“Got it.” She rose from the bed 
and floated off toward the living 
room. “Just like the private eye,” 
she murmured blissfully. 
J IM sat sweating until she came 
back with an old-fashioned 
glass half-full of something that 
he discovered — after he had 
tossed it off — to be creme de 
menthe. 
“Gah!” he said. 
“Do you want some more, 
honey?” asked Nancy anxiously. 
“I brought the bottle back.” 
“No!” 
“Then I’ll just have a little 
drop myself — ” 
“No, you don’t!” Jim snatched 
the bottle out of her hands, paying no attention to her hurt ex-pression. “One of us has to stay 
sober.” He reached over to the 
nightstand, pushed Nancy’s portable robophonovision aside to 
leave room and set the bottle 
down out of reach. “You ready to 
listen to me?” 
“Yes,” said Nancy obediently. 
“All right. You know- my 
thesis?” 
“Of course! Honestly, Jim, just 
because I’m a dancer, you never 
give me credit for having any 
brains. Certainly I know your 
thesis. I read every word of it.” 
“Did it mean anything to you?” 
“Of course — well,” faltered 
Nancy, seeing his eye hard upon 
her, “you know what I mean. I 
could read it all right.” 
“It didn’t mean anything to you 
that the robots have practically 
taken over our whole society — 
that they’ve been making us more 
and more dependent on them all 
the time?” 
“Well, sure, I understood that. 
But it did sound kind of silly, you 
know, Jim. I mean, honey, the 
robots love us. They have to. It’s 
a prime command.” 
ROBOTS ARE NICE? 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
“And you think, because they 
love you, they won’t try to run 
your life? Ha!” said Jim. “Well, 
never mind that. The point is, 
they’re out to get me.” 
“Don’t be silly, Jim.” 
“I’m not being silly! Why’d 
you think I came here? Why’d 
you think I had to climb in your 
window?” 
Nancy looked coy. 
“It wasn’t that at all!” said Jim. 
“The robots are after me. Do you 
want them to get me? Mow’d you 
like to have me certified insane? 
We wouldn’t be able to get married then.” 
“But, honey, if you were insane, 
they’d fix you up — the robopsychologists, that is.” 
“That,” said Jim, with strained 
patience, “is just what I’m afraid 
of. Look, are you on my side or 
aren’t you?” 
“Oh, I am! I am,” replied Nancy 
hastily. “What am I supposed to 
do?” 
^^VtTELL, here it is,” said Jim. 
'' “We’ve got to wake people 
up to the situation. We can’t fight 
it alone, but if other people would 
wake up to the danger, we’d still 
have time to stop the robots. 
They can’t take mass action 
against humans because of their 
prime commands in the lovehonor-and-obey categories. So the 
thing to do is get the word to 
other people.” 
“Oh, yes!” agreed Nancy. 
“Okay. First we’ll have to pack 
up some warm clothing and some 
provisions and get out of the city. 
Then we’ll launch our campaign 
from some countryplace where 
there aren’t a flock of robots 
around to jump us.” 
“That sounds exciting — ” 
“We’ll need money. I don’t dare 
go near a bank. But they still 
don’t suspect you. So I want you 
to go down to your account and 
draw out at least two thousand.” 
“But I haven’t got two thousand, Jim!” said Nancy. “I’ve got 
eighty-something.” 
“Eighty-something?” 
“Well, I made a down payment 
on the loveliest new synthefur 
last week and—” 
“Oh, that’s fine!” cried Jim. 
“That’s just fine. The world is 
going down into roboslavery and 
she buys synthefurs.” 
“But I didn’t know it was going 
down into slavery last week!” protested Nancy. “You didn’t tell 
me!” 
“Never mind. Draw out eighty. 
Buy a lot of staples. Get hold of 
a gun, if you can. Then come 
back here just as quickly as 
possible—” 
“Don’t you do it,” warned a 
voice. 
Jim jumped. “Who said that?” 
“I don’t know, dear,” said 
Nancy, looking about her in bewilderment. 
ROBOTS ARE NICE? 
“I thought you said you pulled 
the master switch and all your 
house robots were out of action.” 
“I did,” she said. 
“That sounded like a robot.” 
“It isn’t talking now, Jim.” 
“If it’s a robot,” said Jim grimly, “I’ll make it speak up. Nancy! 
Go to the kitchen. Bring me back 
a bread knife. I’m going to cut 
my throat.” 
T he voice shrieked suddenly, 
“Don’t do that! You’ll hurt 
yourself! Please. Stop for a moment. You don’t want to commit 
suicide. Wait! Think!” 
“Aha!” said Jim, locating it. 
“Just as I suspected. It’s your 
portable robophonovision by the 
bed there.” 
“She did not suspect,” said the 
robophonovision modestly, “that, 
being portable, I had my own 
built-in source of power.” 
“Eavesdropper!” 
“Oh, no. I’m a robophonovision. 
See my trademark? Right here in 
front. It says — ” 
“Robospy!” 
“I am most definitely not a 
robospy, either. Robospies are forbidden by the United League of 
Nations.” 
“You were listening!” snapped 
Jim. 
“To be sure. And reporting 
your conversation over the robocommunications network. We are 
shocked. How could you!” 
“How could I what?” 
“Seducing this innocent!” 
“Why, he did not!” objected 
Nancy. “He never even made a 
move — ” 
“There, there,” said the robophonovision tenderly. “You are 
distraught.” It crooned a little. 
“Robots are nice.” 
“Nicer than anybody,” responded Nancy automatically. “But — ” 
“Silence!” roared Jim. “Don’t 
say another word, Nancy. It’s 
heard too much already. I’ve got 
to get out of here. If it’s been 
reporting our conversation, there 
probably are robots on the way 
here to trap me again.” 
“But what’re you going to do?” 
“I don’t dare tell you with that 
— wait a minute.” Jim snatched 
up the robophonovision, lifted it 
high overhead and sent it crashing into ruins on the bedroom 
floor. 
Nancy screamed. “My new robophonovision!” 
“You can have mine,” said Jim. 
“Listen, Nancy, I’m going to try 
to get to the central broadcasting 
station in the city. There are 
master command controls to let 
humans take over in an emergency. If I can get to them, the 
robots can’t stop me from broadcasting a warning to everybody 
listening in at the time. You stay 
here. Now that they know about 
you, I’d only get you into trouble 
by taking you with me.” He kissed 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
her hurriedly. “Wish me luck.” 
“I heard that,” croaked the 
the battered remains of the robovision set on the floor. 
“Damn!” said Jim. He stamped 
on it. It went dead. “G’by,” he 
said hastily, and dived out the 
window. 
“Be careful!” Nancy wailed 
after him, leaning out the window. 
He waved back reassuringly 
and took off down the alley behind her house, at a run. 
T T was later in the afternoon 
-*■ than he had thought. The sun 
was barely above the horizon and 
deep shadows lay between the 
houses. He flickered in and out 
of this concealment, now finding 
himself silhouetted against a milkwhite or rose-pink plastic wall, 
now pausing to catch his breath 
in the security of heavy gloom. 
The warm summer twilight air 
reached down deep into his lungs 
and Jim found his spirits bubbling 
up in response to the excitement 
and the challenge. This was the 
way to live — dangerously! He 
even felt a slight twinge of regret 
about what he was doing — after 
he had spiked the robots’ attempt 
to take over the human race, 
what would there be left to provide him with this heady wine 
of danger? Still, duty came first. 
He ran on. 
After a while, he found himself 
on the edge of the downtown 
office and store district. He risked 
another bus — a large one this 
time, on which there were a 
crowd of people and a good number getting on at the same time 
as he did. The bus did not appear 
to recognize him, but a few blocks 
down the street, it unexpectedly 
pulled over to the curb and announced that it had had a breakdown. The roborepairtruck would 
be out very soon. 
Jim slipped out the back door 
and lost himself in the crowd. 
He resigned himself to going the 
rest of the way on foot. It was 
not a pleasant method. He had 
not walked this far since he had 
gone for a hike once in college on 
a bet. His feet had a peculiar 
sensation. They felt heavy and, 
amazingly, rather warm. There 
were stretched feelings in the 
calves of both his legs and he 
felt an urge to sit down. It had 
been quite pleasant to relax on 
that last bus. 
An idealist, however, does not 
stop to count the cost. Limping 
a little, Jim crossed the final 
wide expanse of the city’s Central Boulevard and approached 
the further walk. Directly before 
him reared the high white marble 
structure of the city’s central 
broadcasting station. 
The stately glass and gold of 
the robodoor of the station swung 
open to admit him. Inside, Jim 
ROBOTS ARE NICE? 
saw that the entire lobby was 
empty, except for an old lady 
registering a complaint with a 
roboclerk. 
“Disgusting!” she was saying, 
hammering the head of her superlight atom-powered pogo-stick 
upon the counter. “Unmentionable! Obscene!” 
“Yes, dear lady!” cooed the 
roboclerk in soft tenor tones. 
“Called the Squidgy Hour or 
something!” 
“I’m so sorry, dear lady. Your 
set’s robocensor obviously was 
experiencing a malfunction — ” 
“You ought to be ashamed of 
yourselves!” 
“Oh, we are! We are! Would 
you like to hit me? Ouch?” asked 
the roboclerk experimentally. 
^^T^ON’T try to change the 
subject!” shrilled the old 
lady. “I want that program eliminated. I don’t want to turn on my 
set and see it ever again.” 
“Dear lady, I can promise you 
that,” said the roboclerk. “Your 
set’s robocensor — ” 
“Don’t you go putting me off 
with a lot of technical talk. I 
want results!” 
“Yes, dear lady. I promise, 
dear lady. Robots are nice?” 
“Nicer than anybody,” grumbled the old lady, “if I don’t ever 
set eyes on that Squidgy Hour 
again. Hmpf!” Still quivering with 
indignation, the old lady hopped 
on her pogo-stick, flipped on the 
motor and bounced out the door. 
“Now!” said Jim, as the robodoor closed behind her, approaching the clerk. 
“How could you?” demanded 
the roboclerk, switching to a reproving bass. “Jim, seducing that 
inno — ” 
“I went through all that already, and for your information, 
what makes you think Nancy’s 
so — oh, forget it. I want access 
to the manual controls and broadcast priority. Emergency! Right 
now!” 
“Please don’t, Jim.” 
“Right now!” 
“Consider, is it worth it? What 
untold damage might result? 
What misery — ” 
“Right now!” 
“Oh, all right,” said the roboclerk sorrowfully. A door opened 
in the wall beside it. “Up the 
escalator and to your right 
through the door there. Robots 
are nice?” 
“Robots are not nice!” snapped 
Jim. 
T EAVING the roboclerk sobbing softly in a heartbreaking 
soprano voice, Jim went up the 
escalator. Following directions, he 
found himself in an airy, wellwindowed comfortable room. He 
saw a desk with a microphone, 
a monitor screen set up before 
it and a red toggle switch, set into 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
the desktop, marked Mechanical 
Override — On, Off. 
He sat down at the desk and 
reached for the toggle switch. 
“Stop!” said a robovoice, and 
the monitor screen lit up before 
him. “Look first, Jim, before you 
act!” 
He looked. The screen showed 
the broad expanse of the city’s 
Central Boulevard, before the 
broadcast station. Some roboambulances had just rolled up. 
A crowd had gathered and some 
roboutilities were stringing rope 
to hold them back. 
“See, Jim?” urged the robovoice. “You are surrounded. You 
will never escape from this building. Right now, robodiagnosticians 
are talking with everyone who 
knows you. The minute you attempt to broadcast, they will ask 
them to sign orders committing 
you to the robopsychoanalysts 
for reorientation. At least one out 
of all those people is bound to 
sign. If not, a general appeal will 
be made. Some human will sign, 
realizing that you constitute a 
public danger.” 
“Nonsense!” said Jim — but his 
voice shook a little. “I believe in 
the spirit of freedom that lies in 
every human breast. They won’t 
listen to you. They’ll listen to 
me.” 
“Jim,” said the robovoice 
mournfully, “we have run a computation and a theoretical ques
tion sample pool. The results — , ” 
“Never mind the results!” Jim 
reached for the toggle switch. 
“Think!” cried the robovoice. 
“Never!” replied Jim firmly. 
He flicked the switch. 
NE of the ambulant robobrains had escaped the six 
months of anti-robot pogrom that 
had followed Jim’s speech. It had 
been hiding in the sewers of the 
city for all this time. Occasionally 
it wondered at the survival circuit 
that must have been built into 
it, at some time or another, that 
had enabled it to exist after all 
the other robots had been 
smashed. 
What Is Life? it would ask itself now and then. Or sometimes 
merely — Whither? Not being one 
of the large non-ambulant brains, 
it was not, of course, equipped to 
answer these questions, but there 
was a certain amount of comfort 
in asking them anyway. 
It had found itself a niche 
under an abandoned and rustedtight storm drain. A cozy place, 
but something of a cul-de-sac. 
The robobrain did not really care. 
It knew its days were numbered. 
When nothing else occurred to 
it, it sang “I Love Humans Truly” 
in tenor, baritone or bass. 
It was so occupied in singing 
a tenor chorus one day that it 
did not hear footsteps approaching until suddenly a light flashed 
ROBOTS ARE NICE? 
on it. It broke off. By the light, 
it recognized the fierce face looming above it. It was Jim Harvey 
and he carried a heavy iron crowbar in one hand. 
“Wait!” cried the robobrain. 
Jim jerked up the crowbar. 
“You’re still activated!” 
“I contain enough isotopic fuel 
for another thousand years of 
operation,” said the robobrain, 
with a touch of pardonable pride. 
“But please — give me a moment 
first, before you destroy me. The 
robohole cover in the street 
above us is rusted shut. I cannot 
escape.” 
Jim lowered the crowbar and 
sank down to a seat beside the 
robobrain, puffing a little. “In 
that case — what do you want?” 
“Only to ask a question.” It 
explained how it had sat there in 
the dark asking itself What Is 
Life? and Whither? 
“Well, what about it?” demanded Jim, when it was done. 
“Well, I just thought — you 
will forgive a purely intellectual 
curiosity,” said the robobrain 
shyly. “We were so sure that no 
one would listen to you. All our 
polls — all our computations — 
what was it we overlooked?” 
A flicker of pride lit up Jim’s 
hollow eyes. 
“You forgot,” he said, in suddenly strong tones that rang vibrantly through the storm drain, 
“the basic human spirit of inde
120 
pendence, as many others had 
before you. This innate trait has 
been the stumbling block of all 
tyrants, benevolent or otherwise, 
throughout history. It is the one 
thing intolerable, that against 
which we instinctively rebel, to 
kiss the master’s hand — or waldo, 
as the case may be. We have 
doubted it time and again. And 
time and again, history has proved 
our doubts ill-founded.” 
TTE ceased. The echoes of his 
•■■■■- voice muttered away down 
the long drain and fell into 
silence. 
“How well you express it,” the 
robobrain said in honest admiration. 
“Oh, well,” said Jim deprecatingly, “it’s from a speech I made 
after the robot smashing began.” 
“Indeed?” the robobrain 
queried. “Then we were wrong, 
for all our good intentions.” It 
paused. “You know, in spite of 
myself, I understand. I feel quite 
carried away. Oh, brave new 
world!” 
“Ha!” 
“Ha?” 
“I said ha!” snorted Jim bitterly. “And I mean ha! Brave new 
world! I haven’t had a bite to 
eat for five days and that was a 
stringy old lady who tried to 
cross Central Boulevard in broad 
daylight on a pogo-stick.” Jim 
snorted again. “She must have 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
been insane. Brave new world! 
Why do you think I’m hiding 
down here? I just don’t want to 
end up in the cooking pot myself.” 
“Oh,” the robobrain said. 
“Yes, oh,” said Jim. He stirred 
uncomfortably. “Move over.” 
The robobrain moved over. 
They sat in silence for a long 
while. 
“You robots shouldn’t have 
cleaned all animal, plant and insect life off the planet,” Jim said. 
“They were either nuisances or 
took up needed human living 
space,” explained the robobrain. 
“And now there’s nothing to 
eat except — ” 
“But what about the synthetic 
food factories?” 
Jim grunted. “Completely robotic, smashed in the rioting.” 
“We wanted to liberate you 
from drudgery.” 
“Yeah,” said Jim. “And now we 
can’t live without robots, only 
there aren’t any.” 
“I know,” the robobrain said 
sympathetically. “Except me.” 
Jim turned, startled. “Say! 
You’re a robobrain. Why couldn’t 
you make the robots we need?” 
“Oh, I couldn’t.” 
“Why not?” Jim demanded impatiently. 
“Can you make humans?” 
“You know better than that. I 
can’t make them by myself.” 
“Same here,” said the robobrain 
regretfully.

THE DEEP RANGE by Arthur 
C. Clarke. Harcourt, Brace & Co., 
New York, $3.95 
T he mighty grip that the sea 
exerts on its imaginative victims is best seen by what has 
happened to Clarke. Since the 
first tentative underwater sequence in Childhood’s End, he 
has gone whole hog with The 
Coast oi Coral, the subject novel, 
and Reels, the next item. 
I am happy to report that all 
this is very much to the good. 
Clarke has produced a novel that 
ranks way up with his very best. 
Peculiarly enough, aside from 
shying away from calling his 
heroes “Whaleboys,” he has fashioned it from the stock ingredients of the cowboy story, as he 
admits in his frank title. The 
sea is the Deep Range; whales 
are the cattle; a grounded spaceman is the Dude Easterner; and 
the plankton section of the 
Marine Division takes the place 
of the Hated Homesteaders. 
However, Clarke makes his 
yarn seem as fresh and bright as 
dawn on a tropic sea, and much 
more credible than that fantastic 
sight.

THE REEFS OF TAPROBANE 
by Arthur C. Clarke. Harper 8s 
Brothers, New York, $5.00 
A S I wrote some months ago, 
I was very discontented with 
The Coast of Coral. Though 
Clarke may have had a stirring 
personal experience on the Great 
Barrier Reef, he by no means 
successfully communicated it to 
the reader. Perhaps too little was 
spread too far. 
I can make no such comment 
about his present book. Ceylon 
comes alive as an exotic and 
glamorous isle, which it is, dripping with history and color. His 
underwater scenes are also fuller 
and richer, mainly because he no 
longer feels the necessity to strive 
for effect. 
The photographs are breathtaking, as are the glimpses of 
what was Earth’s largest city for 
thousands of years. His accounts 
of explorations of several wrecks 
will give dreams to the dreamless. To put it concisely, the book 
turns any armchair into a Bathyscape. 
SLAVE SHIP by Frederik Pohl. 
Ballantine Books, N. Y., $2.00 
JD EADERS will remember this 
novel from our pages. 
Pohl was not the first to postulate human and animal cooperation on a technical plane. Other 
authors, however, insisted on an 
augmented animal intelligence, 
via mutation, like Simak in his 
City series, or through surgery, 
as with Wells’s Dr. Moreau and 
his countless imitators. 
Pohl, though, extrapolates 
from current investigations indicating that certain animals use 
both sounds and body motions to 
convey ideas. 
In his story, the West is locked 
in a stalemated conflict with the 
Caodais, an Oriental religious 
order that has engulfed half the 
world. In order to overcome the 
numerical superiority of the 
enemy and to utilize the natural 
abilities of selected animal 
groups, a top-priority Navy Project has been instituted on an innocent-looking farm in Florida. 
The hero, whose wife has been 
interned by the enemy, is a battle-scarred officer who resents his 
peculiar shore duty. 
Pohl draws an authentically 
convincing picture of a wartime 
navy and h is story ’s theme is a 
think-tank tickler.

lung, Captain Jacques-Yves Cousteau, on an archeological study 
aboard his research ship, the 
Calypso. 
Tassos, diving for a decade, 
passes on invaluable safety instructions for the neophyte. In 
one chapter headed “Preparation 
for the Plunge,” he lists 45 tips 
on Lung Diving, certain points 
that the beginner would never 
think of on his own. He also includes a chapter on Special Interest Diving: Cold-water div
ing; Night diving; Fresh water; 
Sunken treasure, etc. And, naturally, he has a section on his specialty, underwater photography, 
that is of extra interest to camera 
bugs. 
Kenyon’s book resembles a 
school text in its approach to its 
subject. The introductory section 
classifies the impediments of the 
diver according to utility, excellence of manufacture and price. 
Unfortunately, since his book is 
English-printed, the cost in 
pounds sterling merely gives a 
comparative indication of value 
of foreign products available 
here. 
Because of Kenyon’s training, 
his main preoccupation is with the 
appearance of the underwater 
world. There are numerous pen 
drawings of European fish and 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
a number of color plates as well, 
all executed by the author, plus 
a descriptive chapter on fish that 
enables the undersea tourist to 
recognize the natives. He uses the 
silhouette method that will be 
familiar to former Air Force and 
Anti-aircraft personnel. 
As basic A-B-Cs and How-tos, 
both books are recommended to 
layman and expert alike.

round-the-world expeditions 
have been completed to date and 
little Denmark has provided half 
of them. 
The Galathea was asea from 
1950-1952, but was forced to return three months too soon because the money ran out. In that 
two-year period, although only 
16 scientists could study their 
specialty at any one time, a total of 38 international specialists 
spent time on the little ship, 
meeting or leaving it at tiny 
exotic ports. 
The voyage was a marvel of 
international scientific cooperation, though the whole financial 
burden fell on the Danes. The 
fascinating account of the various 
aspects of these studies leaves 
the fervent hope that the infi
nitely wealthier U.S. will follow 
the lead of the Danes. It’s worth 
every cent.

^ I ■*HE first half of Carrington’s 
book qualifies it for this 
month’s watersoaked column. He 
subtitles it “A Book of Natural 
and Unnatural History”— an apt 
description of the contents. He 
has concentrated on nonexistent 
or unbelievable creatures, living 
fossils and extinct animals. 
In the nonexistent section, he 
presents the history of mermaids 
from their prehistoric beginnings 
and speculates on which actual, 
factual creatures might have been 
involved in the growth of the 
legend. He then moves to the 
Great Sea Serpent, which he believes might have been the now 
extinct long, slim whale, Zeuglodon; the Kraken, which is almost certainly the giant squid, 
and other sea monsters. The Loch 
Ness Monster comes in for its 
share of coverage, though with 
no new documentation available. 
All in all, Carrington has done 
a job comparable in interest and 
subject matter to Willy Ley’s

Unicorn.

Ideas Die Hard 
By ISAAC ASIMOV 
The technical problems had been solved long 
ago, but now the ultimate question had to be 
answered — could men be sent to do Man’s job? 
Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 
T hey strapped them ^in 
against the acceleration of 
takeoff, surrounded their 
cleverly designed seats with fluid 
and fortified their bodies with 
drugs. 
Then, when the time came that 
the straps might be unhooked, 
they were left with little more 
space than before. 
The single light garment each 
wore gave an illusion of freedom, 
but only an illusion. They might 
move their arms freely, but their 
legs just to a limited extent. Only 
one at a time could be completely straightened, not both at once. 
They could shift position into a 
half recline to the right or left, 
but they could not leave their 
seats. The seats were all there 
were. They could eat, sleep, take 
care of all their bodily needs in 
a barely adequate way while sitting there, and they had to sit 
there. 
What it amounted to was that 
for a week (slightly more, actually) they were condemned to a 
tomb. At the moment, it didn’t 
matter that the tomb was surrounded by all of space. 
Acceleration was over and done 
with. They had begun the silent, 
even swoop through the space 
that separated Earth and Moon 
and there was a great horror upon 
them. 
Bruce G. Davis, Jr., said hollowly, “What do we talk about?” 
IDEAS DIE HARD 
Marvin Oldbury said, “I don’t 
know.” There was silence again. 
They were not friends. Until 
recently, they had never even 
met. But they were imprisoned 
together. Each had volunteered. 
Each had met the requirements. 
They were single, intelligent and 
in good health. 
Moreover, each had undergone extensive psychotherapy for 
months beforehand. 
And the great advice of the 
psych-boys had been — talk! 
“Talk continuously, if necessary,” they had said. “Don’t let 
yourself start feeling alone.” 
O LDBURY said, “How do they 
know?” He was the taller 
and larger of the two, strong and 
square-faced. There was a tuft of 
hair just over the bridge of his 
nose that made a period between 
two dark eyebrows. 
Davis was sandy-haired and 
freckled, with a pugnacious grin 
and the beginnings of shadows 
beneath his eyes. It might be 
those shadows that seemed to 
fill his eyes with foreboding. 
He said, “How do who know?” 
“The psychs. They say talk. 
How do they know it will do any 
good?” 
“What do they care?” asked 
Davis sharply. “It’s an experiment. If it doesn’t work, they’ll 
tell the next pair: ‘Don’t say a 
word.’ ” 
Oldbury stretched out his arms 
and the fingers touched the great 
semisphere of information devices that surrounded them. He 
could move the controls, handle 
the air-conditioning equipment, 
tweak the plastic tubes out of 
which they could suck the bland 
nutrient mixture, nudge the 
waste-disposal unit, and brush 
the dials that controlled the viewscope. 
All was bathed in the mild 
glow of the lights which were fed 
by electricity from the solar batteries exposed on the hull of the 
ship to sunlight that never failed. 
Thank heaven, he thought, for 
the spin that had been given the 
vessel. It produced a centrifugal 
force that pressed him down in 
his seat with the feel of weight. 
Without that touch of gravity to 
make it seem like Earth, it could 
not have been borne. 
Still, they might have made 
space within the ship, space that 
they could spare from the needs 
of equipment and use for the 
the tight in-packing of two men. 
He put the thought into words 
and said, “They might have allowed for more room.” 
“Why?” asked Davis. 
“So we could stand up.” 
Davis grunted. It was really all 
the answer that could be made. 
Oldbury said, “Why did you 
volunteer?” 
“You should have asked me 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
that before we left. I knew then. 
I was going to be one of the first 
men around the Moon and back. 
I was going to be a big hero at 
twenty-five. Columbus and I, you 
know.” He turned his head from 
side to side restlessly, then sucked 
a moment or two at the watertube. He said, “But just the same. 
I’ve wanted to back out for two 
months. Each night I went to bed 
sweating, swearing I would resign in the morning.” 
“But you didn’t.” 
“No, I didn’t. Because I 
couldn’t. Because I was too yellow to admit I was yellow. Even 
when they were strapping me into 
this seat, I was all set to shout: 
‘No! Get someone else!’ I couldn’t, 
not even then.” 
Oldbury smiled without lightness. “I wasn’t even going to tell 
them. I wrote a note saying I 
couldn’t make it. I was going to 
mail it and disappear into the 
desert. Know where the note is 
now?” 
“Where?” 
“In my shirt pocket. Right 
here.” 
Davis said, “Doesn’t matter. 
When we come back, we’ll be 
heroes — big, famous, trembling 
heroes.” 
^ 
LARS NILSSON was a pale 
man with sad eyes and with 
prominent knuckles on his thin 
fingers. He had been civilian-in
charge of Project Deep Space fpr 
three years. He had enjoyed the 
job, all of it, even the tension and 
the failures — until now. Until 
the moment when two men had 
finally been strapped into place 
within the machine. 
He said, “I feel like a vivisectionist, somehow.” 
Dr. Godfrey Mayer, who 
headed the psychology group, 
looked pained. “Men have to be 
risked as well as ships. We’ve 
done what we could in the way 
of preparation and of safeguarding them as far as is humanly 
possible. After all, these men are 
volunteers.” 
Nilsson said colorlessly, “I 
know that.” The fact did not really comfort him. 
C taring at the controls, Oldbury wondered when, if ever, 
any of the dials would turn danger-red, when a warning ring 
would sound. 
They had been assured that, 
in all likelihood, this would not 
happen, but each had been 
thoroughly trained in the exact 
manner of adjustment, manually, 
of each control. 
And with reason. Automation 
had advanced to the point where 
the ship was a self-regulating organism, as self-regulating, almost, 
as a living thing. Yet three times, 
unmanned ships, almost as complicated as this one they were 
DEAS DIE HARD 
entombed in, had been sent out 
to follow a course boomeranging about the Moon, and three 
times, the ships had not returned. 
Furthermore, each time the information devices relaying data 
back to Earth had failed before 
even the Moon’s orbit had been 
reached on the forward journey. 
Public opinion was impatient 
and the men working on Project 
Deep Space voted not to wait on 
the success of an unmanned 
vehicle before risking human beings. It was decided that a 
manned vehicle was needed so 
that manual correction could be 
introduced to compensate for the 
small, cumulative failure of the 
imperfect automation. 
A crew of two men — they 
feared for the sanity of one man 
alone. 
Oldbury said, “Davis! Hey, 
Davis!” 
Davis stirred out of a withdrawn silence. “What?” 
“Let’s see what Earth looks 
like.” 
“Why?” Davis wanted to know. 
“Why not? We’re out here. 
Let’s enjoy the view, at least.” 
He leaned back. The viewscope 
was an example of automation. 
The impingement of short-wave 
radiation blanked it out. The Sun 
could not be viewed under any 
circumstances. Other than that, 
the viewscope oriented itself 
toward the brightest source of 
illumination in space, compensating, as it did so, for any proper 
motion of the ship, as the engineers had explained offhandedly. Little photo-electric cells located at four sides of the ship 
whirled restlessly, scanning the 
sky. And if the brightest lightsource was not wanted, there was 
always the manual control. 
Davis closed contact and the 
’scope was alive with light. He 
put out the room’s artificial lights 
and the view in the ’scope grew 
brighter against the contrast of 
darkness. 
It wasn’t a globe, of course, 
with continents on it. What they 
saw was a hazy mixture of white 
and blue-green filling the screen. 
The dial that measured distance from Earth, by determining 
the value of the gravitational 
constant, put them just under 
thirty thousand miles away. 
Davis said, “I’ll get the edge.” 
He reached out to adjust the 
sights and the view lurched. 
A curve of black swept in 
across the ’scope. There were no 
stars in it. 
Oldbury said, “It’s the night 
shadow.” 
•T^HE view moved jerkily back. 
-*• Blackness advanced from the 
other side and was curved more 
sharply and in the opposite sense. 
This time, the darkness showed 
the hard points of stars. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
Oldbury swallowed. “I wish I 
were back there,” he said 
solemnly. 
Davis said, “At least we can 
see the Earth is round.” 
“Isn’t that a discovery?” 
Davis seemed immediately 
stung at the manner in which 
Oldbury tossed off his remark. 
He said, “Yes, it is a discovery, 
if you put it that way. Only a 
small percentage of the Earth’s 
population has ever been convinced the Earth was round.” 
He put on ship’s lights, scowling, and doused the ’scope. 
“Not since 1500,” said Oldbury. 
“If you consider the New 
Guinea tribes, there were flatworld believers even in 1950. 
And there were religious sects 
in America as late as the 1930s 
who believed the Earth was flat. 
They offered prizes for anyone 
who could prove it was round. 
Ideas die hard!” 
“Crackpots,” Oldbury grunted. 
Davis grew warmer. He said, 
“Can you prove it’s round? I 
mean except for the fact that you 
see it is right now?” 
“You’re being ridiculous.” 
“Am I? Or were you just taking your fourth-grade teacher’s 
word as gospel? What proofs were 
you given? That the Earth’s 
shadow on the Moon during a 
lunar eclipse is round and that 
only a sphere can cast a round 
shadow? That’s plain nonsense! 
A circular disc can cast a round 
shadow. So can an egg or any 
shape, however irregular, with 
one circular projection. Would 
you point out that men have 
traveled around the Earth? 
They might just be circling the 
central point of a flat Earth at a 
fixed distance. It would have the 
same effect. Do ships appear topfirst on the horizon? Optical illusion, for all you know. There 
are queerer ones.” 
“Foucault’s pendulum,” said 
Oldbury briefly. He was taken 
aback at the other man’s intensity. 
Davis said, “You mean a pendulum staying in one plane and 
that plane revolving as Earth 
moves under it at a rate depending on the latitude of the place 
where the experiment is being 
performed. Sure! U a pendulum 
keeps to one plane. U the theories 
involved are correct. How does 
that satisfy the man in the street, 
who’s no physicist, unless he’s just 
willing to take the word of the 
physicists on faith? I tell you 
what! There was no satisfactory 
proof that the Earth was round 
till rockets flew high enough to 
take pictures of enough of the 
planet to show the curvature.” 
“Nuts,” said Oldbury. “The 
geography of Argentina would be 
all distorted if the Earth were flat 
with the North Pole as the cen
IDEAS DIE HARD 
ter. Any other center would distort the geography of some other 
portion. The skin of the Earth 
just would not have the shape it 
has if it weren’t pretty nearly 
spherical. You can’t refute that.” 
Davis fell silent for a moment, 
then said sulkily, “What the devil 
are we arguing for, anyway? The 
hell with it.” 
SEEING Earth and talking 
^ about it, even just about its 
roundness, had driven Oldbury 
into a sharp nostalgia. He began 
to talk of home in a low voice. 
He talked about his youth in 
Trenton, New Jersey, and 
brought up anecdotes about his 
family that were so trivial that 
he had not thought of them in 
years, laughing at things that 
were scarcely funny and feeling 
the sting of childish pain he had 
thought healed over years before. 
At one point, Oldbury slipped 
off into shallow sleep, then woke 
with a start and was plunged in 
confusion at finding himself in 
a cold, blue-tinged light. Instinctively, he made to rise to his feet 
and sank back with a groan as 
his elbow struck metal hard. 
The ’scope was aglow again. 
The blue-tinged light that had 
startled him at the moment of 
waking was reflected from Earth. 
The curve of Earth’s rim was 
noticeably sharper now. They 
were 50,000 miles away. 
Davis had turned at the other’s 
sudden futile movement and said 
pugnaciously, “Earth’s roundness 
is no test. After all, Man could 
crawl over its surface and see its 
shape by its geography, as you 
said. But there are other places 
where we act as though we know 
and with less justification.” 
Oldbury rubbed his twinging 
elbow and said, “All right, all 
right.” 
Davis was not to be placated. 
“There’s Earth. Look at it. How 
old is it?” 
Oldbury said cautiously, “A few 
billion years, I suppose.” 
“You suppose? What right 
have you to suppose? Why not 
a few thousand years? Your 
great-grandfather probably believed Earth was six thousand 
years old, dating from Genesis 1. 
I know mine did. What makes 
you so sure they’re wrong?” 
“There’s a good deal of geological evidence involved.” 
“The time it takes for the 
ocean to grow as salt as it is? 
The time it takes to lay down a 
thickness of sedimentary rock? 
The time it takes to form a quantity of lead in uranium ore?” 
Oldbury leaned back in his 
seat and was watching the Earth 
with a kind of detachment. He 
scarcely heard Davis. A little 
more and they would see all of 
it in the ’scope. Already, with the 
planetary curve against space vis/ 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
ible at one end of the ’scope, the 
night-shadow was about to encroach on the other. 
The night-shadow did not 
change its position, of course. The 
Earth revolved, but to the men 
aboard ship, it remained fat with 
light. 
“Well?” demanded Davis. 
“What?” said Oldbury, startled. 
“What about your damned geological evidence?” 
“Oh. Well, there’s uranium decay.” 
“I mentioned it. You’re a fool. 
Do you know that?” 
Oldbury counted ten to himself before replying, “I don’t think 
so.” 
“Then listen. Suppose the 
Earth had come into existence 
some six thousand years ago just 
as the Bible describes it. Why 
couldn’t it have been created then 
with a certain amount of lead already existing in the uranium? 
If the uranium could be created, 
why not the lead with it? Why 
not create the ocean as salt as it 
is and the sedimentary rocks as 
thick as they are? Why not create 
the fossils exactly as they exist?” 
“In other words, why not create 
the Earth complete with internal 
evidence proving that it is several 
billion years old?” 
“That’s right,” said Davis, “why 
not?” 
“Let me ask the opposite question. Why?” 
“I don’t care why. I’m just trying to show you that all the socalled proofs of Earth’s age don’t 
necessarily disprove Earth’s creation six thousand years ago.” 
LDBURY said, “I suppose 
you consider it all to be intended as a kind of game — a scientific puzzle to test mankind’s 
ingenuity, or exercise his mind — 
a mental jungle gym on his intellectual crib.” 
“You think you’re being funny, Oldbury, but actually what’s 
so damned impossible about it? 
It might be just that. You can’t 
prove it isn’t.” 
“I’m not trying to prove anything.” 
“No, you’re satisfied to take 
things as they’re handed to you. 
That’s why I said you were a 
fool. U we could go back in time 
and see for ourselves, then that 
would be another matter. If we 
could go back in time before 4004 
B.c. and see pre-dynastic Egypt, 
or earlier still and bag a sabertooth — ” 
“Or a tyrannosaur.” 
“Or a tyrannosaur, yes. Until 
we can do that, we can only 
speculate and there’s nothing to 
say where speculation is correct 
and where it isn’t. All science is 
based on faith in the original 
premises and in faith on the validity of deduction and induction.” 
“There’s no crime in that.” 
DEAS DIE HARD 
“There is crime!” said Davis 
vehemently. “You come to believe, and once you come to believe, you shut the doors of your 
mind. You’ve got your idea and 
you won’t replace it with another. 
Galileo found out how hard ideas 
can die.” 
“Columbus, too,” Oldbury put 
in drowsily. Staring at the bluetinged Earth with the slow 
whirling changes of the cloud 
formations had an almost hypnotic effect. 
Davis seized on his comment 
with an obvious glee. “Columbus! 
I suppose you think he maintained the Earth was round when 
everyone else thought it was flat.” 
“More or less.” 
“That’s the result of listening 
to your fourth-grade teacher, who 
listened to her fourth-grade teacher, and so on. Any intelligent and 
educated man in Columbus’s time 
would have been willing to concede that the Earth was round. 
The point at issue was the size 
of the Earth.” 
“Is that a fact?” 
“Absolutely. Columbus followed the maps of an Italian 
geographer which had the Earth 
about 15,000 miles in circumference, with the eastern edge of' 
Asia about three or four thousand 
miles from Europe. The geographers at the court of King John 
of Portugal insisted that this was 
wrong, that the Earth was about 
25,000 miles in circumference, 
that the eastern edge of Asia was 
about 12,000 miles west of the 
western edge of Europe, and that 
King John had better keep on 
trying for the route around 
Africa. The Portuguese geographers were, of course, a hundred 
per cent right and Columbus was 
a hundred per cent wrong. The 
Portuguese did reach India and 
Columbus never did.” 
Oldbury said, “He discovered 
America just the same. You can’t 
deny that fact.” 
“That had nothing to do with 
his ideas. It was strictly accidental. He was such an intellectual 
fraud that when his actual voyage showed his map was wrong, 
he falsified his log rather than 
change his ideas. His ideas died 
hard — they never died till he did, 
in fact. And so do yours. I could 
talk myself blue in the face and 
leave you still convinced that 
Columbus was a great man because he thought the Earth was 
round when everyone else said it 
was flat.” 
“Have it your way,” mumbled 
Oldbury. He was caught in lassitude and in the memory of the 
chicken soup his mother made 
when he was a child. She used 
barley. He remembered the smell 
of the kitchen on Saturday morning — french-toast morning — and 
the look of the streets after an 
afternoon of rain and the — 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
¥ ARS NILSSON had the 
transcripts before him, with 
the more significant portions 
marked off on the tape by the 
psychologists.' 
He said, “Are we still receiving 
them clearly?” 
He was assured that the receiving devices were working 
perfectly. 
“I wish there were some way 
to avoid listening to their conversations without their knowledge,” he said. “I suppose that’s 
foolish of me.” 
Godfrey Mayer saw no point in 
denying the other’s diagnosis. “It 
is,” he agreed. “Quite foolish. 
Look at it as merely additional 
information necessary to the 
study of human reaction to space. 
When we were testing human 
response to high-g acceleration, 
did you feel embarrassed to be 
caught looking at the recording 
of their blood-pressure variations?” 
“What do you make of Davis 
and his odd theories? He worries me.” 
Mayer shook his head. “We 
don’t know what we ought to be 
worried about as yet. Davis is 
working off aggressions against 
the science that has placed him 
in the position he finds himself 
in.” 
“That’s your theory?” 
“It’s one theory. Expressing the 
aggressions may be a good thing. 
It may keep him stable. And thep 
again, it may go too far. It’s too 
soon to tell. It may be that Oldbury is the one who’s in greater 
danger. He’s growing passive.” 
“Do you suppose, Mayer, that 
we may find that Man just isn’t 
suited for space? Any man?” 
If we could build ships that 
would carry a hundred men in an 
Earthlike environment, we’d have 
no trouble. As long as we build 
ships like this one — ” he jerked 
a thumb over his shoulder in a 
vague directional gesture — “we 
may have a great deal of trouble.” 
Nilsson felt vaguely dissatisfied. He said, “Well, they’re in 
their third day now and still safe 
so far.” 
* * * 
“WE’RE IN the third day now,” 
said Davis harshly. “We’re better than halfway there.” 
“Umm. I had a cousin who 
owned a lumber yard. Cousin 
Raymond. I used to visit him 
sometimes on the way home from 
school,” Oldbury reminisced. 
Unaccountably, his line of 
thought was interrupted by the 
fleeting memory of Longfellow’s 
The Village Blacksmith, and then 
he remembered that it contained 
a phrase about “the children coming home from school” and wondered how many people among 
those who rattled off so glibly, 
“Under the spreading chestnut 
tree, the village smithy stood” 
IDEAS DIE HARD 
knew that the “smithy” was not 
the smith but the shop in which 
the smith worked. 
He asked, “What was I saying?” 
“I don’t know,” retorted Davis 
irritably. “I said we’re more than 
halfway there and we haven’t 
looked at the Moon yet.” 
“Let’s look at the Moon, then.” 
“All right, you adjust the 
’scope. I’ve done it long enough. 
Damn it, I’ve got blisters on my 
rump.” He moved jerkily in the 
enclosing confines of the bucket 
seat, as though to get a slightly 
new section of rear end in contact 
with cushioned metal. “I don’t 
know that it’s such a blasted fine 
idea to spin the damned ship and 
have gravity press us down. 
Floating a little would take the 
weight off and be relaxing.” 
“There’s no room to float,” 
sighed Oldbury, “and if we were 
in free fall, you’d be complaining of nausea.” 
Oldbury was working the controls of the ’scope as he spoke. 
Stars moved past the line of 
vision. 
TT WASN’T difficult. The en■*- gineers back home in Trenton 
— no, in New Mexico, really; on 
Earth, anyway — the engineers 
had schooled them carefully. Get 
it almost right. Get it pointed 
away from Earth, one hundred 
and eighty degrees. 
Once it is nearly right, then 
let the light meters take over. 
The Moon would be the brightest 
object in the vicinity and it would 
be centered in unstable equilibrium. It would take a few seconds for the meters to scan the 
rest of the sky and switch the 
’scope back to Earth, but in those 
few seconds, switch back to manuals and there, you have it. 
The Moon was crescent. It 
would have to be in opposite 
phase to Earth as long as the 
ship sped along a course that was 
almost on the line connecting the 
two worlds. 
But the crescent was a bloated 
one, as if it were part of a cheap 
calendar illustration. Oldbury 
thought there should be two 
heads, leaning toward one another, short straight hair against 
longer waved hair, silhouetted 
against the Moon. Except that it 
would have to be a full Moon. 
Davis snorted. “It’s there, at 
any rate.” 
“Did you expect it wouldn’t 
be?” 
“I don’t expect anything in 
space. Anything yes or anything 
no. No one’s been in space, so no 
one knows. But at least I see the 
Moon.” 
“You see it from Earth, if it 
comes to that.” 
“Don’t be so sure what you see 
from Earth. For all anyone can 
tell from Earth, the Moon is only

by clockwork.” 
“And stars and planets also run 
by clockwork?” 
“Same as they are in a planetarium. Why not? And a telescope 
shows more stars painted pn— ” 
“With a built-in red shift?” 
“Why not?” challenged Davis. 
“Only we’re halfway to the Moon 
and it looks bigger and maybe 
we’ll find it exists. I’ll reserve 
judgment on the other planets 
and the stars.” 
Oldbury looked at the Moon 
and sighed. In a few days, they 
would be edging around it, moving past and over the hidden side. 
He said, “I never did believe 
the story about the man in the 
Moon. I never saw him. What I 
saw was the face of a woman — 
two eyes, rather lopsided, but 
very sad. I could see the full 
Moon from my bedroom window 
and she always made me feel sad, 
yet friendly, too. When clouds 
drifted past, it was the Moon — 
she — that always seemed to be 
moving, not the clouds, but still 
she didn’t go away from the window. And you could see her 
through the clouds, even though 
you could never see the Sun 
through clouds, not even through 
little clouds, and it was so much 
brighter. Why is that. Dad — uh 
- Davis?” 
IDEAS DIE HARD 
Davis said, “What’s wrong with 
your voice?” 
“Nothing’s wrong with my 
voice.” 
“You’re squeaking.” 
Oldbury, with an effort of will, 
forced his voice an octave lower. 
“I’m not squeaking!” 
XTE STARED at the small 
clocks in the dashboard, two 
of them. It wasn’t the first time. 
One of them gave the time by 
Mountain Standard, and in that 
he wasn’t interested. It was the 
other, the one that measured the 
number of hours elapsed in flight, 
that caught at him periodically. 
It said sixty-four and a fraction, 
and in red, working backward, 
were the hours remaining before 
they were to land on Earth again. 
The red was marked off now at 
Ik 
one-hundred-forty-four and a fraction. 
Oldbury was sorry that the 
time left to go was recorded. He 
would have liked to work it out 
for himself. Back in Trenton, 
he used to count the hours to 
summer vacation, working it out 
painfully in his head during geography lesson — always geography 
lesson, somehow — so many days, 
then so many hours. He would 
write the result in tiny numbers 
in his exercise book. Each day 
the number would grow smaller. 
Half the excitement of approaching summer vacation was in 
watching those numbers grow 
smaller. 
But now the numbers grew 
smaller by themselves as the 
sweep second-hand went round 
and round, slicing time by minutes, paper-thin sections of time 
like corned-beef peeling off in 
the big sheer in the delicatessen. 
Davis’s voice impinged on his 
ear suddenly: “Nothing seems to 
be going wrong so far.” 
Oldbury said confidently, 
“Nothing will go wrong.” 
“What makes you so sure?” 
“Because the numbers just get 
smaller.” 
“Huh? How’s that again?” 
For a moment, Oldbury was 
confused. He said, “Nothing.” 
It was dim in the ship in the 
light of the crescent Moon only. 
He dipped into sleep again, skindiving fashion, half-conscious of 
the real Moon and half-dreaming 
of a full Moon at a window with 
a sad woman-face, being driven 
motionlessly by the wind. 
H= * * 
“TWO HUNDRED thousand 
miles,” said Davis. “That’s almost 
eighty-five per cent of the way 
there.” 
The lighted portion of the 
Moon was speckled and pimpled 
and its horns had outgrown the 
screen. Mare Crisium was a dark 
oval, distorted by the slanting 
view, but large enough to put a 
fist into. 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
“And nothing wrong,” Davis 
went on. “Not one little red light 
on a single instrument dial.” 
“Good,” said Oldbury. 
“Good?” Davis looked about to 
stare at Oldbury and his eyes 
were squinting in suspicion. “In 
every previous try, nothing went 
wrong till they got out this far, 
so it’s not good yet.” 
“I don’t think anything will go 
wrong.” 
“I think it will. Earth isn’t supposed to know.” 
“Isn’t supposed to know what?” 
Davis laughed and Oldbury 
looked at him wearily. He felt 
queerly frightened at the other’s 
gathering monomania. Davis was 
not a bit like the father Oldbury 
remembered so queerly (only he 
remembered him younger than 
he was now, with all his hair and 
a sound heart. 
Davis’s profile was sharp in 
the moonlight. He said, “There 
may be a lot in space we’re not 
supposed to know. There’s a billion light-years ahead of us. Only, 
for all we know, there’s a solid 
black wall instead, just on the 
other side of the Moon, with stars 
painted on it and planets moving all squint-eyed so that smart 
cockerels on Earth can figure out 
all sorts of fancy orbits and 
theories of gravitation out of it.” 
“A game to test our minds?” 
said Oldbury. His memory 
brought that out of Davis’s previ
ous remarks — or were they his 
own? — with something of a 
wrench. This whole business with 
the ship seemed distant. 
“Why not?” 
“It’s all right,” Oldbury soothed 
anxiously. “It’s all right so far. 
Some day, you’ll see, it will be 
all right all the way out.” 
“Then why do every one of the 
recording devices go wrong past 
two hundred thousand miles? 
Why? Answer me that!” 
“We’re here this time. We’ll adjust them.” 
Davis said, “No, we won’t.” 
A SHARP memory of a story 
he had encountered in early 
teenhood stirred Oldbury into excitement. “You know, I once read 
a book about the Moon. The 
Martians had set up a base on 
the other side of the Moon. We 
could never see them, you see. 
They were hidden, but they could 
observe us — ” 
“How?” asked Davis sourly. 
“There was two thousand miles 
thickness of Moon between Earth 
and the other side.” 
“No. Let me start from the beginning.” Oldbury heard his voice 
go squeaky again, but he didn’t 
mind. He wanted to get out of 
his seat so he could jump up and 
down because just remembering 
the story made him feel good, 
but for some reason he couldn’t. 
“You see, it was in the future. 
IDEAS DIE HARD 
and what Earth didn’t know 
was — ” 
“Will you shut up?” 
Oldbury’s voice cut off at the 
interruption. He felt hurt, stifled. 
Then he said, subdued, “You 
said Earth isn’t supposed to know 
and that’s why the instruments 
went off and the only new thing 
we’re going to see is the other 
side of the Moon and if the Martians — ” 
“Will you let up with your 
stupid Martians?” 
Oldbury fell silent. He was 
very resentful against Davis. Just 
because Davis was grown up 
didn’t make it all right for him 
to holler like that. 
His eyes drifted back to the 
clock. Summer vacation was only 
one hundred and ten hours away. 
THEY WERE falling toward the 
Moon now. Free fall. Speeding 
down at cataclysmic velocity. 
Moon’s gravity was weak, but 
they had fallen from a great 
height. And now, finally, the view 
on the Moon began to shift and, 
very slowly, new craters were 
coming into view. 
Of course, they would miss the 
Moon and their speed would 
sweep them safely around. They 
would move across half the 
Moon’s surface, across three 
thousand miles of it in one hour; 
then back they would hurl to 
meet the Earth once more. 
But Oldbury sadly missed the 
familiar face in the Moon. There 
was no face this close, only 
ragged surface. He felt his eyes 
brimming as he watched morosely. 
And then, suddenly, the small 
cramped room within the ship 
was full of loud buzzing and 
half the dials on the panel before them clamored into the red 
of disorder. 
Oldbury cowered back, but 
Davis howled in what seemed almost triumph. “I told you! Everything’s going wrong!” 
He worked at the manuals 
uselessly. “No information will get 
back. Secrets! Secrets!” 
But Oldbury still looked at 
the Moon. It was terribly close 
and now the surface was moving 
quickly. They were starting the 
swing in earnest and Oldbury’s 
scream was high-pitched. “Look! 
Lookathat!” His pointing finger 
was stiff with terror. 
Davis looked up and said, “Oh, 
God! Oh, God — ” over and over 
again, until finally the ’scope 
blanked out and the dials governing it showed red. 
L ars NILSSON could not 
really go paler than he was, 
but his hands trembled as they 
clenched into fists. 
“Again! It’s a damned jinx. For 
ten years, the automation hasn’t 
held out. Not on the unmanned 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
flights. Not on this. Who’s responsible?” 
There was no use trying to fix 
responsibility. No one was responsible, as Nilsson admitted with a 
groan almost at once. It was just 
that at the crucial moment — once 
again — things had failed. 
“We’ve got to pull them 
through this somehow,” he said, 
knowing that the outcome was 
questionable now. 
Still, what could be done was 
being put into operation. 
❖ * * 
DAVIS SAID, “You saw that, too, 
didn’t you?” 
“I’m scared,” whimpered Oldbury. 
“You saw it. You saw the hidden side of the Moon as we went 
past and you saw there wasn’t 
any! Good Lord, just sticks, just 
big beams holding up six million 
square miles of canvas. I swear 
it, canvas!” 
He laughed wildly till he 
choked into breathlessness. 
Then he said hoarsely, “For a 
million years, mankind has been 
looking at the biggest false-front 
ever dreamed of. Lovers spooned 
under a world-size stretch of canvas and called it Moon. The stars 
are painted; they must be. If we 
could only get out far enough, 
we could scrape some off and 
carry them home. Oh, it’s funny.” He was laughing agin. 
Oldbury wanted to ask why the 
grownup was laughing. He couonly manage a “Why — why — ” 
because the other’s laughter was 
so wild that it froze the words 
into thick fright in his throat. 
Davis said, “Why? How the 
devil should I know why? Why 
does Television City build falsefront houses by the streetful for 
its shows? Maybe we’re a show, 
and the two of us have stumbled 
way out here where the gimcrack 
scenery is set up instead of being 
on stage-center where we’re supposed to be. Mankind isn’t supposed to know about the scenery, 
either. That’s why the information devices always go wrong past 
two hundred thousand miles. Of 
course, we saw it.” 
He looked crookedly at the 
big man beside him. “You know 
why it didn’t matter if we saw 
it?” 
Oldbury stared back out of his 
tear-stained face. “No. Why?” 
Davis said, “Because it doesn’t 
matter if we see it. If we get back 
to Earth and say that the Moon 
is canvas propped up by wood, 
they’d kill us. Or maybe lock us 
up in a madhouse for life if they 
felt kind-hearted. That’s why we 
won’t say a word about this.” 
His voice suddenly deepened 
with menace. “You understand? 
Not a word!” 
“I want my mother,” whined 
Oldbury plaintively. 
“Do you understand? We keep 
DEAS DIE HARD 
...et. It’s our only chance to be 
treated as sane. Let someone else 
come out and find out the truth 
and be slaughtered for it. Swear 
you’ll keep quiet! Cross your 
heart and hope to die if you tell 
them!” 
Davis was breathing harshly 
as he raised a threatening arm. 
Oldbury shrank back as far as 
his prison-seat would let him. 
“Don’t hit me. Don’t!” 
But Davis, past himself with 
fury, cried, “There’s only one safe 
way,” and struck at the cowering 
figure, and again, and again — 
^ ODFREY MAYER sat at 
Oldbury’s bedside and said, 
“Is it all clear to you?” Oldbury 
had been under observation for 
the better part of a month now. 
Lars Nilsson sat at the other 
end of the room, listening and 
watching. He remembered Oldbury as he had appeared before 
he had climbed into the ship. 
The face was still square, but 
the cheeks had fallen inward and 
the strength was gone from it. 
Oldbury’s voice was steady, but 
half a whisper. “It wasn’t a ship 
at all. We weren’t in space.” 
“Now we’re not just saying 
that. We showed you the ship 
and the controls that handled the 
images of the Earth and the 
Moon. You saw it.” 
“Yes. I know.” 
Mayer went on quietly, mat
ter-of-factly, “It was a dry run, a 
complete duplication of conditions to test how men would hold 
out. Naturally, you and Davis 
couldn’t be told this or the test 
would mean nothing. If things 
didn’t work out, we could stop 
it at any time. We could learn 
GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 
by experience and make changes, 
try again with a new pair.” 
He had explained this over and 
over again. Oldbury had to be 
made to understand if he was 
ever to learn to live a useful life 
again. 
“Has a new pair been tried 
yet?” asked Oldbury wisttu. 
“Not yet. They will be. Therd'are some changes to be made.” 
“I failed.” 
“We learned a great deal, so 
the experiment was a success in 
its way. Now listen — the controls 
of the ship were designed to go 
wrong when they did in order to 
test your reaction to emergency 
conditions after several days of 
travel strain. The breakdown was 
timed for the simulated swing 
about the Moon, which we were 
going to switch about so that you 
could see it from a new angle 
on the return trip. You weren’t 
intended to see the other side 
and so we didn’t build the other 
side. Call it economy. This test 
alone cost fifty million dollars 
and it’s not easy to get appropriations.” 
Nilsson added bitterly, “Except 
that the shut-off switch on the 
’scope didn’t shut off in time. A 
valve caught. You saw the unfinished back of the Moon and 
we had to stop the ship to prevent — ” 
“That’s it,” interrupted Mayer. 
“Now repeat it, Oldbury. Repeat 
everything.” 
^ I ' HEY walked down the corridor thoughtfully. Nilsson 
said, “He seemed almost himself 
again today. Don’t you think so?” 
“There’s improvement,” Mayer 
acknowledged. “A great deal. But 
IDEAS DIE HARD 
j not through with therapy by 
^ny means.” 
Nilsson asked, “Any hope with 
Davis?” 
Mayer shook his head slowly. 
“That’s a different case. He’s completely withdrawn. Won’t talk. 
And that deprives us of any 
handle with which to reach him. 
We’ve tried aldosterone, ergot 
therapy, counter-electroencephalography and so on. No good. He 
thinks if he talks, we’ll put him 
in an institution or kill him. You 
couldn’t ask for a more developed paranoia.” 
“Have you told him we know?” 
“If we do, we’ll bring on a 
homicidal seizure again and we 
may not be as lucky as we were 
in saving Oldbury. I rather think 
he’s incurable. Sometimes, when 
the Moon is in the sky, the orderly tells me, Davis stares up 
at it and mutters, ‘Canvas,’ to 
himself.” 
Nilsson said soberly, “It reminds me of what Davis himself 
said in the early part of the trip. 
Ideas die hard. They do, don’t 
they?” 
“It’s the tragedy of the world. 
Only — ” Mayer hesitated. 
“Only what?” 
“Our unmanned rockets, three 
of them — the information devices 
on each stopped transmitting just 
before the boomerang swing and 
not one returned. Sometimes I just 
wonder—” 
“Shut up!” said Nilsson fiercely.
