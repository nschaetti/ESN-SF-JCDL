'IXThen the New York City sub- 
* ’ way system purchased a 
modified and rather rudimentary 
computer and installed it in the 
cab of one of its subway trains, 
the operating union took an ex- 
tremely dim view of it. They sus- 
pected that if this experiment 
worked it would be only a step to 
automating all transportation and 
thus to throwing the city’s whole 
force of motormen and conduc- 
tors out of work. 

In this suspicion they were un- 
doubtedly right. It’s true that it 
seems likely it would be a rather 
long step, not to be taken in a 
hurry. After a year’s experience 
with what Mike Quill calls “the 



Headless Horseman” and the 
subway officials term “the Auto- 
mated Train” it seems pretty 
clear that there’s a way still to 
go. The automated train was, 
to begin with, given the simplest 
job in the system — it shuttles 
back and forth from Times 
Square to Grand Central, never 
switching, never stopping except 
at the ends of the line. It is a 
job that an idiot could do pretty 
well, and in fact the Headless 
Horseman does it in about the 
style of an idiot . and a neu- 
rotic and heavy-handed idiot, at 
that. It bumps irresolutely to its 
terminal and, as soon as it real- 
izes it is there, flies into a panic

and jams on the brakes . while 
the standby human motorman 
scowls into a dark future with his 
hands in his pockets. 

Why is the standby motorman 
there? To take over in case of 
emergency, says the union. To 
provide a means of testing and 
studying the equipment, says the 
company. But in fact he is there 
for only one reason — because 
if the subway system hadn’t 
agreed to employ him there the 
employees would have gone out 
on strike, feeling, with much 
logic, that the time to deal with 
a threat is before it gets too big 
to handle. 

Q uestion is, how big is the 

threat going to get? And 

more important — when is it go- 
ing to happen? 

It is our opinion — admitted- 
ly backed by nothing much in the 
way of a guarantee, because we 
don’t expect to be around long 
enough to be called on it — that 
the worst fears of the opponents 
of automation will never be real- 
ized because (a) the great dis- 
astrous upsurge in unemploy- 
ment simply won’t happen and 
(b) anyway, most of it has hap- 
pened already! For the tendency 
to develop ways for two men to 
do what used to be ten men’s 
work is not something that was 
invented with automation. It has 
been going on for something 



more than two hundred years. It 
began with the steam textile mills 
in England; it grew with the in- 
troduction of the cotton gin in 
the South. It came to a head a 
third of a century ago in what 
was then called “rationalization” 
— or sometimes, “the assembly 
line” — and indeed it did lead to 
serious stress, playing a part in 
the cause and prolongation of 
the Great Depression. 

Automation is only a part of a 
larger process — the continuing 
growth of techniques to increase 
the productivity of the individual 
worker. Granted that this has 
over the last couple of centuries 
abolished tens of millions of jobs. 
Can you imagine anyone apply- 
ing for any of those jobs today? 

There are simply some jobs 
that are too boring, too arduous, 
too pointless for a human being 
to do. These are the jobs that 
automation is out to get, just as 
its predecessors have got the jobs 
of picking the seeds out of cot- 
ton bolls and running a loom with 
a foot-treadle. 

If it hadn’t been for previous 
similar developments, a lot of us 
would have been doing those 
jobs today. Those jobs are gone — 
so those of us who would have 
had them are, in a sense unem- 
ployed. 

And frankly — we’re doing 
pretty well out of it, aren’t we?

GALAXY 



GRANDMOTHER 

EARTH 

by j. t. mcintosh 

ILLUSTRATED BY FINLAY 

Old Earth was dying, and neither 
courage nor strength could save 
it . but perhaps vanity could! 



I 

/'"'vne after another the girls in 
bikinis and stripsuits on the 
beach at Cannes raised their 
heads and preened themselves as 
the tall, bronzed stranger strode 
past along the waterline. They 
could have saved themselves the 
trouble. He didn’t even glance 
at them. 

That he should be a stranger 



was in itself intriguing. There 
were scarcely any strangers any 
more. There were so few people 
left that everybody knew nearly 
everybody else. 

The Americas, Asia, Australia 
and Africa were all empty, save 
for a few determined hermits. 
The Pyramids, Sydney Bridge, 
the Grand Canyon and Red 
Square no longer drew throngs 
of gaping, camera-clicking tour- 



7 



ists — although they were all 
still there, only Sydney Bridge 
and Red Square showing signs of 
neglect. (The Grand Canyon and 
the Pyramids were neglected too, 
but they didn’t show it.) 

The Riviera being as good a 
place as any for a few score of 
thousands of people to live, win- 
ter and summer, with minimum 
effort and least danger from 
flood, fire, drought, pestilence, 
famine and wild animals, the 
population of Grandmother 
Earth had gradually collected 
there. California, Miami, Syd- 
ney, Biarritz and Algiers had 
held out for a while in the hope 
of winning the battle to be the 
last resort of a race dying of 
lethargy and apathy. One by one, 
however, they had put up the 
shutters. 

Cannes beach, although un- 
deniably part of a reservation 
for the aged, equally undeniably 
didn’t look it. The really old 
couldn’t summon up enough en- 
ergy to go out any more. Only 
teens and twenties, and the few 
children, went to the immense 
trouble of prettying themselves 
and walking to the beach to sun- 
bathe. And most of these were 
women. 

When a race is dying, the aver- 
age woman holds out longer than 
the average man. 

When a man comes to the con- 
clusion that there is no longer 

8 



anything worth doing, he’s dead. 
A woman lasts longer because to 
the end a certain desire for ad- 
miration remains. She keeps her- 
self clean and firm and attrac- 
tive after her male counterpart 
has surrendered to dirt and idle- 
ness and silent solitude. She 
seeks the company of her own 
sex, and at least the acknowledg- 
ment of the other sex, when a 
man can’t be bothered going out. 
So she remains half alive when 
he is three-quarters dead. 

Marcel was unaware of the in- 
terest he was kindling in a hun- 
dred golden-brown, scarcely cov- 
ered breasts. He would not have 
cared had noticed it. He had 
other things on his mind. 

Marcel was one of the last 
rebels. True, if he had lived a 
few centuries earlier, tempera- 
ment unchanged, he would have 
been regarded as the most timid, 
indolent conformist. But in his 
world, in his time, he was a 
rebel. He wanted to live, when 
nearly everyone else was content 
to die. 

IT e was in Cannes for a Coun- 
cil meeting that afternoon. 
He had cycled from San Remo, 
stopping overnight at Nice, for 
the distance was all of fifty miles. 
It was a long journey, but he 
preferred to cycle. Cars were be- 
coming increasingly unreliable 
and there were no spares any

GRANDMOTHER EARTH

more. Marcel had left one car 
in Genoa and another in Frejus, 
the two limits of present-day hu- 
man habitation. Either might 
have been repaired in Nice or 
San Remo, but in Genoa and 
Frejus, the withering outposts of 
a shrinking community, they 
were so far from real civiliza- 
tion that they might as well have 
been in dead, empty Chicago. 

Not many delegates would take 
the trouble to come, he reflected 
as he walked along the golden 
sand, the tideless Mediterranean 
throwing up wavelets at his feet. 
Of the Council of 100 he doubt- 
ed if more than thirty would be 
present. Perhaps only twenty- 
five. 

Well, the fewer there were, the 
fewer he’d have to convince. 
Something had to be done, and 
Marcel thought he knew what. 
Even if only twenty-five dele- 
gates turned up, the Council re- 
tained all its powers. Quorum 
provisions had gone long ago — 
it was seldom that any meeting 
of any committee achieved this 
technical competence. 

In his mind he examined his 
proposal for flaws. He found 
none. It would work. And it was 
perhaps the only thing which 
would work. There was no point 
in thinking about it any more. 

Released at last from his mood 
concentration, Marcel took no- 
tice of one of the girls sleepily 

10 



sunbathing up by the promenade 
wall. She was a pretty blonde of 
perhaps fourteen, her brown 
body lightly censored by a blue 
stripsuit. 

She smiled at him, frankly in- 
viting, promising all there was 
to promise. 

He crossed the ten yards of 
sand that separated them and sat 
beside her. 

“Hi,” she said. “I’m Roya. 
How come I’ve never seen you 
before?” 

“I’m from San Remo. Marcel 
is the natfie.” 

“I’ve been in San Remo often, 
and I never saw you there.” She 
seemed unable to get past the 
astonishment that such a man 
could exist, could have existed 
for all her life and perhaps seven 
or eight years more, quite un- 
known to her. 

“I’m not often on the beach. 
I’m a carpenter. I make chairs, 
tables, cabinets, things like that.” 

“I guess somebody has to make 
them,” she admitted. “But you 
must be on the beach sometimes. 
Where else did you get that tan?” 

“The sun shines,” Marcel re- 
torted, “not only on the beach, 
not only on the seventy by two 
mile strip we live in, but over 
the mountains, across the sea and 
on other continents. I could ac- 
quire a tan eleven thousand 
miles from San Remo beach.” 

She stared. “You talk funny.” 

GALAXY 



“I suppose I do. Perhaps it 
comes of occasionally reading a 
book.” 

“You read books too? Looking 
like you do? You make tables 
and chairs and read books?” 

He looked at her thoughtfully, 
wondering if behind her pretty 
face there was a mind capable 
of understanding important 
things, wondering whether she 
was trivial because she had never 
encountered anything but triv- 
iality. 

“What would you expect me 
to do?” he asked quietly. 

“I thought you were a lover.” 

“You flatter me not.” 

T Tis tone was cold, but it failed 
to repress her. She giggled. 

Even sex was too much trou- 
ble for a race which had lost its 
vitality. In the early stages of 
the decline, a century or two 
back, when it was steep but not 
precipitous, promiscuity such as 
Babylon and the French court 
had never dreamed of became 
the rule. It did not last. Con- 
quests in which there was no 
contest ceased to divert. It be- 
came necessary to search for and 
invent new sensations, and soon 
there were none left. 

Now the jaded survivors lan- 
guorously chased not sex but 
pleasure in sex, some ghost of 
meaning in sex. Sex with issue 
was of course rare. Few women 



wanted children, few who want- 
ed them were capable of bearing 
them, and few men could give 
them all the necessary assistance. 
Marriage was as dead as witch- 
craft. All that was left was a lazy 
longing in both sexes to be 
stirred, however briefly and un- 
productively, into a semblance 
of passion. Nobody expected it 
to happen often, or for long. 

Certain comparatively lusty 
individuals of both sexes were 
much in demand as kindlers of 
passion. They could be amateurs, 
subtle or crude, powerful or frail, 
but they all had this in com- 
mon: they offered life. Never 
had public opinion changed as 
drastically as in the way lovers 
were regarded. Once lovers 
would have been called gigolos, 
courtesans and worse. Now only 
odd people like Marcel were ir- 
ritated to be thought to be no 
more than a lover. 

“/ want to be a lover,” Roya 
said. 

“You would.” 

She started telling him frank- 
ly about her qualifications. Al- 
though she did not claim to have 
had the great complete experi- 
ence yet, she had come close, she 
said. It was the fault of the males 
that she had not done better. 
With Marcel she thought she. 

“How old are you?” he asked* 
abruptly. 

“Fourteen.” 



GRANDMOTHER EARTH 



11 



“You’ve plenty of time.” 

If you could achieve passion 
at twelve or with a partner of 
twelve, good luck to you. By the 
time you were fifteen that com- 
partment of your life might be 
closed for ever. 

Briefly interested in Roya, 
Marcel looked her over. Her 
blue stripsuit was a long ribbon 
which went round behind her 
neck, crossed her breasts and ran 
down in a narrow V to go up 
behind her and curve back round 
the hips to her abdomen again. 
It covered as much flesh as a 
bikini, but not the same flesh. 
Young girls wore stripsuits to 
show that they didn’t sag — if 
they didn’t sag. 

“Want me to go home with 
you now?” he asked ungracious- 
ly- 

“Why not? It’s only half a 
mile.” 

He stood up. “In that case, 
let’s forget it,” he said. “I have 
to come back here anyway.” 

He strode on, unconscious of 
the fact that he, the rebel, the 
fighter, the energetic champion 
of lost causes, had just proved 
that he was very nearly as in- 
dolent as everybody else. 

II 

r T''he Council meeting was held 
•*- in the Majestic, on the prom- 
enade, formerly one of the lead- 

12 



ing hotels of Cannes. Marcel, a 
white coat over his trunks, ar- 
rived precisely as the meeting 
was due to start. 

His eyes widened incredulous- 
ly. There were not twenty-five 
delegates present. Not fifteen. 
Not even ten. 

Apart from himself, one man 
and one woman were present. 

They waited for five minutes, 
but no one else turned up. Then 
Dion, the senior member present, 
declared the Council in session. 

The subject was the moribund 
state of human society on Earth 
(it usually was), and the purpose 
of the meeting was to consider 
ways and means of improving 
the situation. 

Earth was dying, and knew it, 
but didn’t like it. 

Not unnaturally, the three 
delegates who had taken the 
trouble to come (Marcel from 
San Remo, Selba from Nice and 
Dion from half a block away) 
were the three who were not 
only the most concerned about 
the situation, but also the read- 
iest to produce possible counter- 
measures. 

Dion spoke first. An elderly, 
silver-haired man, just on the 
point of turning querulous, he 
addressed the meeting over the 
heads of Marcel and Selba as if 
the hall, formerly a ballroom, 
were packed with eager, atten- 
tive listeners. 



GALAXY 



“The situation is grave,” he 
said, as if they didn’t know it. 
“The present population is 
roughly sixty thousand. But of 
this number, ten thousand are 
over seventy. In twenty years, if 
the present trend continues, the 
population will be fifty thousand. 
In another twenty, less than 
forty. I say again, the situation 
is grave. Extremely grave. .” 

Nobody argued with him. 

He came presently to his main 
point “Yet we peopled the gal- 
axy,” he declared. “We blazed 
the way to the stars. On scores 
of far-off worlds, human settle- 
ments are thriving, growing, 
prospering. It is our sons and 
daughters who gave the galaxy 
life. Now Mother Earth has be- 
come Grandmother Earth. Our 
colonies are spawning new col- 
onies, ever further out, further 
from home.” 

He suddenly looked directly 
at Marcel and Selba. “It is up 
to our children to help us,” he 
said. “We gave of our best. It 
was our strongest, bravest, most 
eager men and women who voy- 
aged on the starships. We have 
heard how they prospered. Now 
we need the help of our strong, 
lusty children. We need. .” 

He went on in this strain for 
some time. What started as an 
impassioned ringing appeal 
slowly dissolved into the hurt 
bitterness of an old man aban- 



doned by his children, of Lear 
betrayed by his daughters. He 
had no positive suggestion. How 
the far-distant Terran colonies 
were to be told of Earth’s need 
of their strength and lust for life 
was not mentioned. What exactly 
they were to do was not men- 
tioned either. (Come back and 
recolonize the planet which had 
given them all birth? Or send 
some mystic talisman which 
would miraculously restore life 
to a dying world?) 

In conclusion he held out his 
hands in pitiful appeal, and then 
sat down. 

S elba, next in seniority, spoke 
next. She referred acidly to 
Naro, the President, who had 
not bothered to come and pre- 
side, although he lived only a 
mile or two away in Golfe Juan. 
Then she demolished Dion’s 
vague complaints in a couple of 
sentences. 

“The nearest colony is twenty- 
two years away,” she said. “If 
Dion wants to go there and bring 
back a restoration team, I sug- 
gest he will have to spend the 
next forty-four years of his life 
doing it.” 

She paused significantly. 
Dion’s age was uncertain; what 
was certain, however, was that 
he didn’t have another forty -four 
years to live. 

Selba was a tall, straight wom- 

13 



GRANDMOTHER EARTH 



an, once beautiful and still re- 
gally handsome. Now nearly 
fifty, she had grown out of the 
hot-headed certainty of youth 
into the cool, inflexible certain- 
ty of age. She had everything 
taped. 

“If we go to the colonies,” she 
said firmly, “it must be to join 
them, not beg from them.” 

Having made this brief open- 
ing statement she stood back, so 
to speak, to admire it. 

“Women hold the key,” she de- 
clared. “In every really impor- 
tant situation, women always 
hold the key. Now, most of us 
are sterile or barren — most of 
us of both sexes. There is no 
real reason for this, except that 
as a race we have lost the will 
to live. Yet if those of us who 
could have children had child- 
dren, the population level would 
stabilize and even increase. 

“Why don’t women who could 
have children bear them? Part- 
ly because they fear childbirth. 
Partly because they shrink from 
the responsibility and sheer hard 
work of bringing up children. 
We must overcome both these 
things. 

“As a closed community, we 
cannot do this. There is no com- 
petition. Women who refuse to 
face the responsibility of being 
women are permitted to persist 
in their refusal. What we need 
is a parallel community — a 



rival community, in which more 
blunt, brutal, vital rules of con- 
duct apply. Where can we find 
such a community? Only in the 
colonies.” 

So her solution was for the 
Earth survivors to uproot them- 
selves, every last one of them, 
and join one of the colonies. 
There was a three-quarters-fin- 
ished ship, she said, somewhere 
in America. She understood it 
was near Philadelphia. It would 
be a small matter to finish it 
and evacuate Earth. 

IV /T arcel’s turn came. Like Sel- 
ba, he began by demolish- 
ing the previous speaker. 

“Do you know what is done 
last on any huge technical proj- 
ect like building a starship?” he 
asked her directly. 

She admitted she did not, con- 
triving to suggest that the knowl- 
edge was not important. 

“I’ll tell you,” Marcel said. 
“All the most difficult and com- 
plicated things. The things which 
demand the greatest skill and 
the greatest scientific knowledge. 
It would be easier by far to 
build a starship to 75 per cent 
completion than to do the rest.” 

Without a pause he demand- 
ed: “Do you know how many 
passengers such a ship could 
carry?” 

“I imagine a great many — ” 

“ Y es. A vast complement. Two 



14 



GALAXY 



hundred and eighty, plus crew. 
Three hundred twenty in all. 
And we have 60,000.” 

He waited. Selba waited too, 
hostilely. 

“We can forget the colonies,” 
Marcel said at last, “as they have 
forgotten us. We’ll see colonists 
only if some settlement decides 
to send a ship here. And why 
should they? Nobody pays social 
calls that take forty-five to sev- 
enty years to complete. That’s 
why we haven’t seen a ship from 
and of the colonies since before 
the last outward-bound starship 
left here a hundred and fifty 
years ago — carrying the last of 
our adventurers. One day, when 
some of the colonies have fin- 
ished building and have time to 
waste on things that don’t matter 
very much, a shipload of arch- 
aeologists and anthropologists 
will arrive — but, the way things 
look now, by the time they do 
there will only be remains for 
them to argue over.” 

“It’s not right,” said Dion, al- 
most to himself. “They should 
come and see us. We gave them 
birth.” 

“Sentimentality,” said Selba 
coldly. “Why should they care? 
It’s us that’s in a desperate situa- 
tion, not them.” 

“That’s just it,” Marcel ob- 
served. “We’re not in a desper- 
ate situation. We couldn’t be in 
an easier situation. We’ve picked 



one of the best all-the-year-round 
climates in the world. Fruit and 
crops grow so easily we scarcely 
have to do more than collect 
them, there’s unlimited pasture 
for our cattle, and we have vast 
stocks of the things we can no 
longer be bothered to make, like 
textiles, ballpoint pens and plas- 
tic toilet-paper dispensers. Far 
from being desperate, we’re in 
such an easy situation that we’re 
all dying of sheer boredom.” 

There was sufficient truth in 
this for the others to let it pass, 
although they would have ex- 
pressed it differently. 

Marcel made his suggestion 
without hedging. “There used to 
be a border at Menton, between 
France and Italy. Let’s close it! 
Let’s create difference, hostility 
and distrust. It’s our only way 
to survive.” 

Selba forgot for a moment to 
be acidly polite. She crowed 
with triumph. 

“Marcel is young,” she said. 
“Too young to remember that 
the plan he suggests was tried 
forty years ago — and was a 
miserable failure. Naturally! 
Because the solution is an arti- 
ficial one. The conflict he wants 
is artificial. When the border 
was closed, people sailed past it 
in boats. They swam round the 
barriers. Seeing no sense in arti- 
ficial, unnecessary prohibitions, 
they ignored them.”

There was silence. Marcel, 
disappointed, had to admit to 
himself that if the Council 
adopted his plan, the general 
public would probably do once 
more exactly what they had done 
forty years ago — ignore the 
closure. They wouldn’t storm the 
barriers. That would be too 
much trouble, and somebody 
might get hurt. They would 
simply sail or swim past the bar- 
rier when they felt like it. That 
was no trouble at all. 

There was still sense in his 
idea, but as Selba bluntly said, 
it was an artificial solution. Al- 
most anything which might be 
tried suffered from the same 
flaw. There was no question of 
boredom when an individual or 
a community had to struggle 
desperately for survival. But it 
was no use pretending that a 
desperate situation existed when 
everyone could plainly see it did 
not. 

In the silence they heard a 
strange but not quite unknown 
sound — the sound of aero en- 
gines. 

Ill 

'T'he black raider swept in from 

across the Mediterranean, tow- 
ing a large anti-gravity barge. 
Linked together by a steel tow- 
wire, the two vessels circled 
Cannes and then dropped rap- 



idly to hover near the harbor. 

Indolent as they were, the lo- 
cal inhabitants flocked to the 
spot. This was an incident com- 
pletely out of the ordinary: al- 
though there were planes at 
Nice airport still allegedly capa- 
ble of flight, only a few old men 
had ever piloted an aircraft and 
no younger people showed any 
particular inclination to learn. 

The black plane must be from 
some other, unknown commu- 
nity. That such a group existed 
was not surprising. Tiny pockets 
of humanity were known to exist, 
or to have existed, in many 
places. That it should be at a 
level of achievement capable of 
operating planes was a surprise, 
and by no means an unpleasant 
one — 

Until the machine-guns open- 
ed up. 

No one was hit. The bursts of 
fire were evidently meant to con- 
tain the crowd which had already 
gathered. Isolated from the rest 
of the town by a fusillade, they 
crowded together fearfully with 
screams of horror, and no one 
who was not already there made 
any attempt to join them. 

Marcel was among the hun- 
dreds who, on their way to join 
the crowd on the promenade, 
saw and heard what was going 
on and crept under cover. 

The plane landed, the barge 
settling slowly behind it. Scores 



16 



GALAXY 



of black-suited men emerged. 
They spoke little. Their long 
black guns did all their talking 
for them. 

Blind panic made some of the 
trapped herd try to run to safe- 
ty. The black raiders shot over 
their heads. The warning was 
enough. 

Silence fell again. The black 
raiders no longer had to shoot. 
The two or three hundred men 
and women huddled together in 
horrified apprehension had 
learned their lesson. 

The raiders all wore black 
pants, black sweaters and gro- 
tesque gas masks. Those among 
the hundreds of prisoners who 
kept their heads saw the impli- 
cations of the masks: The raid- 
ers were prepared to release tear 
or poison gas if they had to. 

The anti-gravity barge reached 
the ground. Another dozen black- 
suited men jumped down. 

And then the purpose of the 
raid emerged. The raiders went 
among their prisoners, threaten- 
ing all of them but otherwise 
ignoring most of them. 

Those they did not ignore were 
the youngest and prettiest wom- 
en. These were sent to the barge. 

There were more screams and 
several people fainted. Oddly 
enough, they saved themselves 
by fainting. The black raiders 
contemptuously ignored anyone 
who lapsed into unconsciousness. 



The crowd consisted of those 
who were quickest on their feet 
and had been on the beach or 
promenade when the plans ap- 
peared. They were therefore the 
youngest inhabitants of the town, 
more than half of them children. 

The raiders ignored girls who 
had not reached maturity. Those 
who had were chosen if they 
were attractive enough, no mat- 
ter how young they were. 

When they had screened the 
whole group, the raiders had 
forty-nine girls between twelve 
and twenty-five. All of them 
were in the barge and the doors 
were shut. But they could still 
be sefen through the glass cover 
which enclosed the vessel, cry- 
ing, beating the glass. 

nr'here was no move to rescue 
them. The people of Cannes, 
whether in the crowd on the 
promenade or watching from 
the surrounding buildings, had 
not forgotten the lesson of the 
machine-guns or the significance 
of the gas masks. 

The raiders went back to the 
grounded plane and the door in 
its shiny black side slammed be- 
hind them. 

None were in the barge with 
the women prisoners. None were 
needed, apparently. When the 
plane rose vertically into the air, 
the barge rose with it, operated 
by remote control. 



GRANDMOTHER EARTH

Those who remained on the 
promenade cowered as if expect- 
ing a blow. Many of them were. 
It seemed not unlikely that the 
black raiders, their booty safe, 
would now open up with mur- 
derous guns or drop lethal gas. 

However, they did not. The 
black plane suddenly darted east- 
wards along the coast and was 
soon out of sight. 

The people of Cannes, on the 
promenade or in the buildings 
overlooking it, blinked and 
frowned in surprise. The barge 
with the forty-nine girls in it 
had been left sixty feet up, mo- 
tionless over the promenade. 

Marcel emerged from ' cover 
and ran to the beach. All around 
him people were shouting, talk- 
ing excitedly, looking up at, the 
barge. He ignored them. The 
raiders would be back. Contemp- 
tuously they had left their booty 
in plain sight, out of reach. 

Obviously the girls must be 
rescued. But how? Marcel 
gauged the distance — sixty feet, 
with black asphalt below. Jump- 
ing was out of the question. 

The girls had a door open and 
were crowded behind it, looking 
down fearfully. There must be 
some way to rescue them. 

The barge would stay at sixty 
feet, resisting any effort to pull 
it down. Could it be towed? 
Many of the buildings only a 
few hundred yards away had 



windows high enough for the 
girls to climb through, if the 
barge could be moved against 
them. But how to get a rope to 
the barge? 

Marcel remembered having 
seen pictures of people jumping 
from burning buildings into 
sheets held by a dozen men. 
Would it work, without prac- 
tice? Could the girls be per- 
suaded to jump? 

Easier still, surely much easier, 
was to get a rope to the barge. 
A rope could haul up a rope lad- 
der. Failing that, surely the girls 
were desperate enough to climb 
down a rope? 

A thin cord could haul up a 
rope. Was it possible to throw 
a weight attached to a cord sixty 
feet in the air? It ought to be — 
and yet, judging the distance 
again, he knew he couldn’t do it 
himself. Sixty feet was only an 
estimate, it might be more. And 
the girls couldn’t lean more than 
a foot or so beyond the door. 
It would be necessary for the 
thrower to stand back and throw 
the weight into the doorway. 
That would entail a throw of 
more like a hundred and twenty 
feet. 

Some of the men standing 
around were already trying ex- 
perimental casts with small ob- 
jects they had in their pockets. 
None of them managed to reach 
the barge. 



18 



GALAXY 



T>ut there had to be a way. 
-■-'Haul a cart with a bale of 
hay below the barge? That 
might work, but the raiders 
would not be gone long. Con- 
temptuous as they might be of 
the courage and resource of the 
people of Cannes, they must be 
aware that in a couple of hours, 
even an hour, some way of re- 
scuing the women must be found. 
Whatever they had to do, what- 
ever sent them racing along the 
coast toward Nice and Monte, 
would not occupy them more 
than half an hour at most. 

Ordinary ladders were useless. 
You couldn’t jump from or to 
the top of a ladder. And from 
the top of a swaying ladder it 
wasn’t easy to throw a rope hard 
and accurately. 

Marcel thought of harpoons 
and spring guns, only to aban- 
don the line of thought. You 
might unearth a harpoon in 
working condition in a couple 
of days. Not in ten minutes. 

Couldn’t the girls make a rope 
out of their clothes? After an- 
other glance up at them he aban- 
doned that idea too. Most of 
them wore bikinis and stripsuits. 
The skirts, shorts and blouses 
which a few of them wore were 
too brief and fragile to supply 
more than a few feet of rope lad- 
der in total. And the raiders 
would not have left anything 
useful in the barge. 



“The fire station!” he sudden- 
ly shouted. “Where’s the fire 
station?” 

Most of the people around 
him stared blankly, but some 
caught on at once. A dozen men 
started to run up into the town. 
Marcel went with them. 

The fire station was closed, 
derelict. Nobody still alive had 
any fire-fighting training. The 
ordinary citizen knew better 
than to start fires and let them 
get out of hand — there would be 
no organized rescue work, and 
everybody knew it. Such fires as 
did occur were left to burn 
themselves out. They were rare, 
for no building had been built 
for centuries of materials which 
would bum easily. 

In the first bay stood two dead 
fire engines, rusting and rotten. 
They had ladders which would 
still reach sixty feet and more, 
and although the motors would 
never run again, the vehicles 
could be pushed. 

But the ladders were power- 
operated and there was no way 
to raise them by hand. 

As Marcel was examining the 
fire engines, a shout came from 
deeper in the station. Someone 
had found an older fire engine, 
even rustier and more rotten, 
but with a ladder which could 
be raised by hand. 

It took twenty of them to push 
it out. The steering wheel was 



GRANDMOTHER EARTH 



19 



jammed, but the front wheels 
could be kicked into position 
when the fire-wagon had to be 
turned. 

They manhandled it under the 
barge and turned the handles. 

The metal ladder was rusted 
into a short, solid mass. One of 
the handles broke under the 
strain six men were putting on it. 

Marcel seized an ancient axe 
and jumped up on the engine. 
He tapped the ladder and the 
rust gave, inch by inch. Others 
were smearing butter on the 
moving parts. The ladder crept 
upwards. 

When it reached the door in 
the side of the barge a cheer 
went up. Then there was sudden 
silence. The onlookers, hundreds 
of them now, were drawing 
breath for the next cheer, the 
one that would greet the sight 
of the first girl climbing down 
the ladder. 

It didn’t come. The girls 
crowded in the doorway sixty 
feet up were looking at the an- 
cient, black, swaying ladder with 
distrust. They were less scared 
to remain where they were than 
to entrust themselves to the lad- 
der. 

“Look — they’re coming back!” 
Marcel shouted. 

The girls didn’t look to check. 
A fifteen-year-old girl in a white 
bikini was first on the ladder. 
That was enough to start the 



rush. The women in the barge 
who ten seconds before had been 
hanging back doubtfully were 
fighting to be next to descend. 

Quick as they were, it took a 
surprisingly long time for forty- 
nine women to climb down a 
sixty-foot ladder. Many anxious 
glances were cast along the coast 
before the last girl reached the 
promenade. 

The last girl was Roya. Mar- 
cel pulled her off the fire escape 
and dragged her away from the 
promenade. Now that the girls 
were safe, no one was anxious to 
remain. They all knew the black 
raiders would be back. 

The ancient fire engine was 
left where it stood. 

When the plane came back ten 
minutes later there wasn’t a liv- 
ing creature to be seen in any 
street in Cannes. 

The plane buzzed angrily 
round the empty barge. Then it 
started machine-gunning the 
streets. Hundreds of windows 
were broken and a few small 
fires were started. Several people 
who had stood too close to a 
window were injured by flying 
glass. 

The raiders did not, however, 
land again. They knew that this 
time they would be met by no 
welcoming crowd. To rout out 
the women they had lost they 
would have to search every 
building in Cannes, risking any 



20 



GALAXY 



counter-measures that might 
have been taken against them. 

At last they turned and flew 
out over the Mediterranean, tak- 
ing the empty barge with them.

(tTt was terrible,” Roya said. 

“I’ve never been so terrified 
in my life.” 

“Of what, precisely?” Marcel 
enquired curiously. 

Apparently Roya didn’t know, 
and that made it worse. 

“You’re not very sympathetic,” 
she protested. 

“Oh, but I am,” said Marcel. 
“If I seem to be smiling, it’s just 
a trick of the sun and the pecu- 
liar shape of my face.” 

“There’s nothing to smile 
about!” Roya said warmly. “The 
raiders machine-gunned half a 
dozen places and dropped tear 
gas in Monte. What’s funny 
about that? It’s a wonder no- 
body was killed.” 

“Nevertheless,” Marcel said 
comfortably, “nobody was.” 
Privately he was convinced 
that the raiders’ object had been 
to frighten the Rivierans, not to 
murder them. They had shown 
themselves ail along the inhabit- 
ed coast, not relying on tele- 
phone communication to spread 
the word of their coming. Yet 
at each place they had fired wide 
first, shooting up the streets only 



when they had given the local 
populace plenty of time to get 
under cover. 

This was no more than the 
first act of a long play, and the 
tension would rise. What the 
climax would be Marcel had no 
idea, but he was sure there was 
much more to come before a 
crisis was reached. 

And he was secretly delighted. 
Although he had helped to frus- 
trate the black raiders, wasn’t 
their sudden appearance exactly 
what he and Selba and even 
Dion wanted? The Council of 
100, differing on details, had 
agreed for a long time that what 
was needed to infuse life into 
the dying community was con- 
flict, different aims and interests 
strongly and stubbornly held. 
The mere existence of the black 
raiders might be exactly what 
was required to galvanize the 
Rivierans into new life. 

“You seem to be taking it very 
calmly,” Roya complained. 

“Inwardly I’m shaking,” Mar- 
cel assured her. 

The black raiders would be 
back. The Riviera community 
must take defense measures. Be- 
fore returning to the Majestic, 
Marcel wanted to have some 
ideas to put before the Council. 

“What’s that shouting?” Roya 
said suddenly. 

They were both instantly alert. 
An hour before, there had been 



GRANDMOTHER EARTH 



21 



nothing to fear. Now everyone 
held himself ready for instant 
flight. 

The crowd gathering near the 
harbor, however, seemed to see 
no reason for flight. Since the 
crowd was forming just outside 
the harbormaster’s office, it was 
more than likely that the stir 
was caused by some fresh item 
of news that had come in by 
telephone. Whatever had hap- 
pened had happened somewhere 
else. 

“I’ll go and find out what it’s 
all about,” said Roya, jumping 
up. Marcel was content to let 
her. The Council, still in session, 
might at that moment be discuss- 
ing the raiders, and Marcel still 
had no contribution to make. 

Guns. They’d have to look for 
guns, ammunition, bombs. When 
the raiders came back there 
would have to be some kind of 
resistance. At least enough to 
make them cautious. 

Suppose there really was fight- 
ing, what would it be like? What 
was war like? Marcel had read 
books and seen old movies. But 
he couldn’t imagine scores, per- 
haps hundreds of people impla- 
cably determined to kill or be 
killed. 

He experienced strange sensa- 
tions in his body. His chest was 
tight, his belly uneasy. There was 
a rushing sound in his ears. He 
recognized excitement anci wel- 



comed it. He even welcomed fear. 
When fear was present there was 
no boredom, no apathy. 

That day marked a turning- 
point in human history. Things 
would never be the same again! 

T> oya came running back. “It 
A was all a game,” she said, 
laughing in breathless relief. 

“A game?” 

“A trick, a stunt. The black 
plane just landed at Alassio. The 
engine failed out at sea and it 
had to limp back to the coast” 
“But. .” Marcel’s thoughts 
were chaotic. A trick? A game? 

“Naro was behind it. Imagine 
it, Naro, the President of the 
Council! It was just a trick to 
make us think we had enemies.” 
“Naro?” said Marcel blankly. 
“Yes, Naro. The real reason 
the raiders wore gas masks was 
so that we wouldn’t recognize 
them. When they left us in the 
barge, you were meant to get us 
out. Imagine that! Of course, 
when the engine failed — ” 
“Where did Naro get the 
plane?” Marcel demanded. 

“In a shed near Genoa. As I 
was saying, when the engine fail- 
ed over the sea they had no 
choice but to land where they 
could. And they had to admit the 
whole thing. They had to surren- 
der and explain who they were.” 
Roya had more to say, much 
more. For her the news was un- 



22 



GALAXY 



alloyed relief. She wasn’t angry 
over what had happened, she 
was merely glad that the black 
raiders didn’t represent a danger 
after all. That nothing represent- 
ed a danger. That the world (or 
at least the narrow strip of coast 
she knew) was as safe a place 
as she had believed for all of 
her fourteen years. 

The general reaction would be 
very like Roya’s. No great harm 
had been done. The whole black 
raider affair had been a stunt, 
no more. It would be too much 
trouble to figure out a just and 
fitting punishment for the raid- 
ers. The easiest thing to do would 
be to laugh the incident off, treat 
it as a joke. 

And the easiest thing to do 
was always the thing that was 
done. 

Marcel heard no more. He for- 
got Roya and wandered blindly 
away, bitterly disappointed. 

Selba was right, damn her. Ar- 
tificial solutions were no use. 
Pretense was no use. A threat 
might save the Rivierans — but 
it had to be a real threat. 

The trouble was, whatever was 
done had to be done from out- 
side the small community that 
was Earth’s last civilization. And 
there was nobody outside to do it. 

It was because of the abortive 
incident of the black raiders that 
when the Mercury arrived over 
Cannes the next day, nobody be- 



lieved her arrival represented 
anything very important, but no- 
body took any chances. Almost 
certainly this was another trick, 
another fake, another stunt. Nev- 
ertheless, real shells had pepper- 
ed Cannes the previous day, and 
somebody might have died. 

From under cover, the popu- 
lation of Cannes waited cautious- 
ly to see what happened. 

V 

T'om Piggott turned the wheel 
of the magnifying screen to its 
fullest extent. The docks of Mar- 
seilles rushed 'up at him. Then, 
as he cut in the power-operated 
fix mechanism, he was able to 
scan parks and sidewalks from 
an apparent height of twenty 
feet, the viewer swiveling to keep 
a succession of fixed points on 
the screen although the ship was 
making five hundred knots at 
fifteen thousand feet. 

The view was good, there be- 
ing little or no haze and no 
cloud. But there was nothing 
much to see, certainly nothing 
that Piggott was looking for. 
Here and there buildings had 
collapsed, blocking streets from 
side to side. Parks and green 
spaces had become jungle. In 
some places the jungle pockets 
were driving salients into the 
dead concrete world that tried 
to contain them.

“Want me to ease up so you 
can take a closer look?” the pilot 
said. “Want me to drop to a few 
hundred feet?” 

“You needn’t bother,” Tom 
said. “There’s nobody there.” 
"But you still think there are 
people left somewhere? Though 
we’ve checked Lisbon, Madrid, 
Barcelona and not seen as much 
as a dead body?” 

“That’s just it,” Tom said. 
“There’s no bodies in the streets 
and no sign of destruction, ex- 
cept through the natural erosion 
of time. So we can take it there’s 
been no pestilence and no war. 
The people of these cities haven’t 
been struck down suddenly. 
They’ve migrated.” 

“Where to?” 

“Well, on this continent they’d 
go to the Riviera or Southern 
Italy or Greece, I’d say. Warm 
but not too hot. It’s not surpris- 
ing there aren’t many of them 
left. A hundred and fifty years 
ago the population was already 
drawing into pockets in the best 
climates — New Zealand, Cali- 
fornia, Miami, the Riviera.” 
“The names mean nothing to 
me,” said the pilot. 

You should read.” He sighed 
and spun the wheel back, switch- 
ing off the fix mechanism. The 
screen now showed a moving 
picture shot from five hundred 
feet up. Tom did not watch it 
continuously; the rapid move- 



ment would give him eyestrain. 

“Hurry on to Cannes and I’ll 
take another look,” he said. 
“Sure, boss,” said the pilot. 

“I guess it would make sense 
to recolonize Earth,” Tom 
mused. “It needs it. It needs it 
so bad I can’t see the Terrans 
raising any objections . assum- 
ing there still are any left to ob- 
ject to the idea.” 

Although he was merely think- 
ing aloud, the pilot elected to 
answer. “You’re forgetting the 
eighth settlement law. Nobody 
can move in once a planet’s on 
the ‘developed’ list.” 

“But that law was intended to 
protect expanding settlements,” 
Tom objected. “It’s taken for 
granted that any colony past the 
initial hardships will be grow- 
ing like a forest fire. It wasn’t 
meant to apply to worlds where 
the population is dwindling.” 
“It’s still the law. And by the 
time it’s changed and colonists 
can come here, another century 
will have passed.” 

There was no need to comment 
on this. If there were Terrans 
left, there couldn’t be many. 
Could they last another century? 
Could they wait a hundred years 
for a blood transfusion? 

Tom spun the wheel and cut 
in the fix mechanism again. Al- 
most at once he let out a yell: 
“This is it! There’s people down 
there!”

GALAXY 



T ess than ten minutes later the 
-®- j/ news ship Mercury landed 
beside Cannes harbor. 

Tom came out alone, looking 
around him in surprise. From the 
air he had seen scores, perhaps 
hundreds of people. Now there 
were none. Cannes looked as 
empty and deserted as Lisbon 
and Madrid and Barcelona. 

But it wasn’t. One or two bi- 
cycles stood around, clean and 
obviously in current use. The 
boats in the harbor were sea- 
worthy, riding high. The litter 
lying around was new litter. 
Most significant of all, a paper 
cup full of ice cream, dropped 
on its side on the hot asphalt, 
was only beginning to disgorge 
its contents in a slow, creamy 
stream. 

Tom faced the blank windows. 
“Come on out!” he shouted, feel- 
foolish. “We’re friends. Anyway, 
there’s only two of us.” 

Nothing happened, though 
now he caught glimpses of faces 
in upstairs windows. When he 
stared at any particular window, 
the faces disappeared. 

Fear of infection — that might 
be it. They were afraid that he 
had brought with him some 
plague harmless to him but dead- 
ly to them. They needn’t worry. 
He told them so, feeling even 
more foolish, shouting explana- 
tions at silent buildings. 

The hell with it, he said to 

GRANDMOTHER EARTH 



himself, spinning on his heels. 
The pilot looked up sardonically 
as he entered the Mercury's con- 
trol room. “White man speak 
with lungs of brass. Indians wait 
in bullrushes, laughing selves 
silly.” 

“Okay, so now you can see 
what you can do,” Tom retorted. 
“They’re timid, that’s all. But 
they’d hardly be scared of you.” 
The pilot stood up. “You don’t 
think so?” 

“No. But if you go the way 
you are, the point may be lost.” 
The pilot looked down at her 
shapeless overalls and evidently 
saw what he meant, for she un- 
zipped them and stripped them 
off. Then she took off her cap 
and shook out her hair. 

The point was no longer in 
any danger of being lost. Her 
sweater and shorts were utilitar- 
ian, not primarily decorative. 
However, there was no doubt 
that she was a girl and unarmed. 

“I go,” she announced, “brave- 
ly and without complaint. Have 
my medal sent to my mother.” 
“There’s no danger. They’re 
scared of us, I tell you.” 

When Stella emerged into the 
sunshine, the Terrans remained 
hidden. However, Tom’s reason- 
ing was sound. A lone girl ob- 
viously unarmed represented no 
great danger. 

After Stella had wandered a 
couple of hundred yards from 

25 




the ship, Marcel, who had been 
watching cautiously from the 
shadows between two buildings, 
stepped out and faced her. 

“Hello,” he said, and then with 
more enthusiasm as he got a 
good look at her, “helloP’ 

r T''his time there were over nine- 
ty members present. There 
hadn’t been such a turnout at a 
Council meeting for over a cen- 
tury. Dion presided; Naro 
thought it prudent to stay quiet- 
ly at home for the time being. 
On Dion’s left was Stella, on his 
right Tom. 

Tom had the floor. He was ex- 
plaining what the Mercury was, 
who he and Stella were and what 



they were doing on Earth. 

And already the Council was 
bitterly disappointed. From the 
very beginning Tom made* it 
clear that his visit was unofficial 
and not the forerunner of a 
larger-scale colonial expedition 
to Earth, that its object was not 
in any sense to render assistance 
to the Terrans, that Earth was 
only one of twenty worlds to be 
visited and that he and Stella 
would remain for only thrae 
days. 

Most of the Council members 
were old. Many of them, like 
Dion, felt that the colonies ought 
to be far more interested in the 
world which had given them 
birth, ought to visit Earth far 



26 



GALAXY 




more frequently, and ought to 
be gravely concerned over 
Earth’s problems. Briefly ex- 
cited when they learned the 
Mercury was from the colonies, 
these members now slumped in- 
to gloom, scarcely listening. 

Others, like Marcel and Sel- 
ba, were still listening intently, 
alert for anything that could be 
turned to account. The Mercury, 
was, after all, from the colonies. 
More than that, it would be back 
there within a few weeks, if what 
Tom Piggott was saying could be 
believed. 

What message was the Mer- 
cury going to take back? What 
message did the Terrans want 
her to take back? 



“Some of you will be wonder- 
ing how we managed to come 
here at all,” Tom was saying. 
“As you can see we’re both in 
our twenties. And we’ve already 
traveled over eighty light- 
years. .” 

Nobody was particularly in- 
terested in his description of the 
principle of the Mercury. Tech- 
nical matters had long ago be- 
come too much trouble to try to 
understand. Keeping the water 
and electricity supplies going 
was about the limit of present- 
day technical achievement. 

Marcel gathered vaguely that 
the ship was a time machine and 
suspended animation tank as 
well as a vehicle. The ship itself 



GRANDMOTHER EARTH 



27 



had to go every inch of the way, 
taking many years to do so. But 
it was possible to play tricks with 
time if not with distance, pro- 
vided the crew did not consist 
of more than two or three 
people. (Another disappoint- 
ment. A twenty-five-year journey 
still took twenty-five years if 
more than three people had to 
travel.) The Mercury and her 
crew, the latter in suspended ani- 
mation, took many years over 
the various hops — but since the 
journey was accomplished in a 
kind of time vacuum, a hundred- 
year round trip could be com- 
pleted in an apparent period of 
weeks. 

“No mission like ours would 
ever be possible without such a 
technique,” Tom said. “Radio’s 
no good in the galaxy. Until now, 
space travel was too slow to be 
used for anything less than set- 
tlement. It’s not worth spending 
fifty years in space, even in sus- 
pended animation, merely to 
find something out. So there’s 
been little or no communication 
between distant settlements. But 
this way, some of our big news 
agencies figured it was worth 
• financing a galactic news round- 
up. Stella and I are visiting Sher- 
bourne, Centauri, Sirius, Medoc 
and Sol, catching up on the news 
of the last century or so.” 

So it was just another stunt. 
Well, what else? The Mercury 



would take back to the colonies 
the interesting information that 
Earth was nearly dead. And that 
was all it would be, interesting 
information. 

Marcel ceased listening to 
Tom, as many of the others had 
done already. He looked instead 
at Stella. 

Stella had hit Marcel like a 
thunderbolt. Tom was energetic, 
efficient, businesslike; Stella 
was all these things and some- 
thing more. Tom’s vitality did 
not startle Marcel. Stella’s did. 

Stella, Marcel had decided in 
that first moment, represented 
his personal future. What he 
wanted of her was more than 
sex, more than marriage, more 
than children. He needed her as 
a man dying of thirst needs wa- 
ter. He needed her and his race 
needed her. 

(In the next few days, Tom 
was saying, he and Stella and 
the Terrans would exchange in- 
formation. Stella would take a 
record of all the events of the 
last century and a half on Earth, 
while he brought the Terrans up 
to date on what had happened 
in the galaxy in that time.) 

Marcel, and through him his 
people, needed Stella so desper- 
ately that she could not be al- 
lowed, could not be given any 
opportunity to refuse. You don’t 
ask for what you need. You take 
it. 



28 



GALAXY 



Quietly, unobtrusively, Marcel 
slipped out of the ballroom. 

VI 

S tella had wanted to sleep on 
the ship, but Tom said that 
was no way to win the confidence 
of the Rivierans. So they had 
two rooms in one of the ex- 
hotels near the harbor. Two 
rooms, and not adjoining at that. 

It wasn’t very late when Stella 
got to her room. The Terrans 
seemed to need, or fancied they 
needed, twelve hours’ sleep at 
nights. And they didn’t get up 
with the dawn. 

“Good night,” Stella said firm- 
ly outside her room. 

Tom grinned. “On several oth- 
er worlds I would have argued,” 
he observed. “On several other 
worlds I have argued. On this 
one, the state of your virtue 
doesn’t interest me.” 

“In other words,” said Stella, 
“the natives are friendly. Got 
one waiting for you now?” 
“Yes. Roya.” 

“Thought she was Marcel’s 
girl friend?” 

“She wanted to be before I 
turned up.” 

“Don’t you find her too in- 
sipid for words?” 

“There aren’t going to be any 
words.” 

“Good night, then,” said Stella 
tolerantly. 



“Don’t worry,” Tom said. “It 
will be.” 

Entering her room, Stella 
switched on the light. She was 
not greatly surprised when noth- 
ing happened. In the few hours 
she had been with the Rivierans 
she had formed a fair idea of 
the situation on Earth, and she 
already knew that though the 
electricity supply was good and 
reasonably reliable, all electri- 
cal fittings were over fifty years 
old and it was common to have 
to test one component after an- 
other before light or heat could 
be obtained. 

Since she was tired and the 
moonlight from the uncurtained 
window was adequate, she didn’t 
propose to bother. She moved to 
the bed, unclasping her belt. 

From behind, an arm went 
round her. A soft pad was held 
over her mouth. 

She struggled violently, but in 
the first moment of shock she 
had drawn a deep breath through 
the cloth. Her movements, de- 
spite herself, became slower and 
feebler and more purposeless. 

When she awoke she was in a 
vehicle of some sort, roaring and 
bumping over a rough road. She 
sat up at once. 

“What the devil is going on?” 
she demanded. 

Marcel stopped the car and 
switched off the engine. “We’d 
better do some talking,” he said. 



GRANDMOTHER EARTH 



29 



He switched off the lights too to 
save the battery. 

“Oh, it’s you.” She recognized 
him easily enough. They were 
on an open road in bright moon- 
light. There was no sign or sound 
of the sea. 

“Yes. We’re about fifty miles 
from Cannes — that’s forty miles 
from the nearest human habita- 
tion.” 

“And what,” she demanded 
hotly, “is the idea?” 

“I just want to make sure that 
when the Mercury leaves, you 
won’t be on it. I think I’ve made 
sure of that already, for the car’s 
practically out of gas and it 
won’t be easy to find any more. 
I’m sorry I had to kidnap you, 
but I had to be certain — ” 

Before he could stop her she 
was out of the car and running 
back the way they had come. 

Marcel, taken aback, did noth- 
ing at all for several seconds. He 
had assumed that there would be 
a great deal more discussion be- 
fore any action was taken — 
possibly acrimonious discussion, 
but still discussion. The way 
Stella made up her mind and 
acted took him by surprise. She 
had heard him say that they were 
forty miles from the nearest hab- 
itation. She didn’t intend to at- 
tempt forty miles on foot, did 
she? 

Presently he turned the car 
and drove back. Within a few 



minutes he caught up with Stella, 
who had stopped running. When 
he drew in beside her, however, 
she took to the wasteland at the 
side of the road, running once 
more. 

“Stop!” Marcel shouted. “Stop 
and we’ll talk it over.” 

Already the girl was almost 
out of sight. 

AT arcel got out of the ca; and 
ran after her. He was angry 
and baffled. She hadn’t even 
tried to discuss the matter with 
him, hadn’t bothered to ask him 
to drive her back to Cannes. It 
was as if she regarded him as 
insane — not dangerous, not im- 
portant, just a harmless, slightly 
irritating lunatic. 

Well, he’d catch her and make 
her discuss the matter. 

Catching her wasn’t so easy. 
Once or twice he came close, and 
then she pulled away from him 
again. Soon he realized that he 
had already lost his chance of 
catching her. In the first few 
minutes he might have done so 
by expending all his energy. But 
Stella’s stamina was greater than 
his. 

She might let him come close, 
seeing no need to waste her en- 
ergy. She had no intention of 
letting him catch her. 

The next time he came close 
enough, Marcel gasped: “All 

right, I’ll take you back.” 



30 



GALAXY 



She stopped and turned, 
watching him warily from fif- 
teen yards’ distance. * 

“If,” Marcel went on, “you 
talk things over first.” 

“There’s nothing to talk over,” 
she retorted. “I’m going back to 
Cannes. Don’t think I can’t find 
it. I’ll find the sea and work my 
way along it. Tom will wait for 
me, even if it takes me a year. 
He has to.” 

“Has to?” 

“What sort of reception do 
you think he’d get if he went 
home without me?” 

Marcel hadn’t considered that. 
Now that she mentioned it, it 
was obviously something he 
should have considered. His plan 
had been based on Tom’s firm 
declaration that 'the Mercury 
would remain only three days on 
Earth. Marcel had thought, rath- 
er ingenuously, that if he kept 
Stella out of the way for three 
days Tom would leave without 
her. 

“All right,” he sighed. “We’ll 
go back.” 

She came a little nearer. “I 
don’t blame you for trying,” she 
said, not unkindly, “even though 
it lets me in for a long walk. 
What is it, do I inflame you with 
passion or something?” 

“That too,” he sighed. “But 
it’s more than that, and I wasn’t 
just thinking of myself. We need 
your spirit.” 



She looked at him with pity. 
“I know jjpu do. But you can’t 
get it by taking it — any more 
than a cannibal can acquire 
bravery by eating his enemy’s 
heart. You can o. y get it by 
having it.” 

“With you, I’d be a different 
man.” 

“Don’t delude yourself. Tom’s 
having a party right now with 
Roya. He’s satisfied. If a man 
really is a man, he doesn’t need 
a woman to give him backbone. 
If he isn’t, she can’t anyway.” 

Marcel tried not to be con- 
vinced, but the fact that Tom 
was satisfied with Roya was hard 
to get around. 

Stella came closer still. “Don’t 
try anything else,” she warned. 
“Anyway, you were wasting your 
time.” 

“What do you mean?” 

“That if it came to a fight, I’d 
win.” 

“I’m stronger than you.” 

She shrugged. “Want a demon- 
stration? We both know what 
you want. Take it.” 

When he touched her, she 
caught his wrist and the next 
moment he found himself on his 
back. 

“Try again,” she invited coolly. 

He said, “No, I’m convinced.” 
He was more than convinced. 
He was hurt. 

They didn’t have to walk after 
all. The car took them to the 



GRANDMOTHER EARTH 



31 



nearest village before running 
out of gas, and there Stella, not 
Marcel, found more. He would 
have been content to sniff 
around a filling-station and give 
up if no fuel was readily ob- 
tainable. She found her way 
down to the underground tanks 
and bored a hole in the bottom 
of one of them. 

A /T arcel didn’t try anything 
-*■ else. The fact that Tom 
spent all his spare time with 
Roya filled Marcel with gloom, 
not because he was jealous but 
because this seemed to prove that 
the fault lay in him, not Roya, 
that Stella was right when she 
said that no woman could give 
a man backbone. 

Just before they left for the 
next world on their list, Tom 
and Stella talked to Dion, Mar- 
cel, Selba and Roya in the ship. 

“You’ve certainly got some 
kind of a fixation, you people,” 
Tom said. “I’ve only seen one 
worse case.” 

“Fixation?” Marcel queried. 

“About being old and finish- 
ed. About being the cradle of 
the galaxy and being abandoned 
by your ungrateful children and 
all that.” 

“That’s not a fixation,” said 
Dion sadly. “It’s true.” 

“Nuts,” said Tom rudely. 
“Didn’t we tell you about Aidan? 
Maybe we didn’t, at that.” 



“What’s Aidan?” Marcel asked. 
“A planet. Not an important 
world. Like Earth, only more so. 
All anybody can say about 
Aidan is ‘Who cares?’ ” 

They didn’t know what he 
meant, and said so. 

“Well, what does it matter 
where people come from, any- 
way? I was born on a world 
called Pradis, and because it’s 
cold I like hot worlds. I like 
this one. At least, I like this bit 
of this one. I don’t owe Pradis 
any debt. Who cares whether I 
ever go back there or not? You 
people have some cockeyed 
ideas. Why should anyone 
come back here, anyway?” 
“Because this is the mother 
world,” said Dion patiently. 

“Didn’t I tell you about 
Aidan?” 

“No, you didn’t,” said Stella, 
taking a hand. “Aidan’s a world 
just like this. The few thousand 
people there think the whole 
galaxy should honor her because 
the human race evolved there.” 
“But they didn’t,” Selba said 
coldly. “Earth is the mother 
world.” 

“Can’t be,” Tom said definite- 
ly. “Your history only goes back 
about twenty thousand years. 
Aidan’s creative period was 
about ninety thousand years ago. 
I don’t know whether Aidan 
colonized this world directly or 
indirectly, but there’s no doubt 



32 



GALAXY 



at all that they’re older than 
you.” 

“And they show it,” Stella re- 
marked. “You’re old, but the 
people of Aidan are senile.” 
“Older than us?” said Dion, 
puzzled. 

“Much older. They keep 
threatening to die out, as if the 
whole galaxy would collapse if 
they did. But they don’t manage 
to die out, because every few cen- 
turies they become too lazy to 
practice birth control any more.” 
“This is a lie,” said Selba icily. 
“For reasons of your own, you’ve 
invented a world called Aidan.” 
“To justify yourselves in re- 
fusing to help us,” said Dion. 
“It’s only to be expected. Young 
worlds have no time for the old.” 
Tom protested laughingly. 
“Give me one good reason why 
we should invent a planet that 
doesn’t exist.” 

“I’ve given you it,” Dion re- 
torted. “To justify yourselves in 
refusing to help us.” 

“What justifies you in refusing 
to help Aidan?” 

They blinked at him. “We 
can’t,” Selba said, “and any- 
way. 

She stopped. 

“And anyway, why should 
you?” Tom said easily. “Of 
course. Who cares about Aidan 
anyway?” 

“It’s a lie,” Selba said. “All a 
lie.” 



“Wait a minute,” Marcel sai«T 
slowly. “Aidan. We’ve never 
heard of it, have we? What 
about Eden? Maybe there’s 
something in this story after all." 

VII 

X^Then the Mercury had left, 
” the Rivierans found some 
further information about Aid- 
an, but not much, among the 
data Tom Piggott had left. 

Apparently there was such a 
world. And it claimed to be the 
cradle of the human race. And 
nobody cared. 

At the next Council meeting 
ar new rule was passed — any 
member who missed three meet- 
ings running without an excuse 
would be suspended. 

A labor force was organized to 
renovate the public service un- 
dertakings like electricity, water 
and sewage. First in Cannes, 
then San Remo, then Monte, 
then Nice. 

The first issue for five years 
of the Riviera Times came out. 
This one was made necessary by 
the quantity and vehemence of 
things which had to be said 
about the visit of the Mercury 
and all that came out of it. 

The sober editorial simply 
pointed out that if the rest of 
the galaxy believed Aidan was 
the birthplace of the human 
race, and didn’t care, Earth 



GRANDMOTHER EARTH 



33 



could not expect much attention 
now or in the future. 

And already there were many 
signs that Earth might not need 
charity after all. Well, it was a 
bit ridiculous, wasn’t it, to be 
complaining of your age when 
your mother was still alive. 
Especially when she spent so 
much time complaining. 

Naro’s son set up a still and 
began making whisky. Some said 
this was a retrograde step. But 
as the alcohol consumption went 
up, so did the number of births. 
The two things might not, of 
course, be connected. 

Crime went up, and this was 
certainly a retrograde step. How- 
ever, it could no longer be said 
that nobody cared about any- 
thing. People cared a great deal 
about a great many things. Mar- 
cel nearly landed in serious 
trouble himself after a fight over 
Roya. The child she was going 
to have was* his, not Tom Pig- 
gott’s. The man who said other-, 
wise very nearly died for saying 
it. 

A scheme was afoot to sail 
across the Atlantic, and colonize 
the New World. While this wa$ 
agreed to be a trifle ambitious 
as yet, the plan found general 
favor. There was an urge in all 
communities to colonize. Earth 



might not be ready yet to rejoin 
the mad rush to colonize the gal- 
axy; but at least she could colo- 
nize Earth. 

Tust after the Mercury was 
clear of Earth’s atmosphere 
and before they took to the sus- 
pended-animation tanks, Stella 
said: “I don’t think it’s going 
to work.” 

“Sure it’s going to work,” said 
Tom confidently. “Leave it to 
your Uncle Tom. I may as well 
be your uncle — there doesn’t 
seem much chance of any other 
relationship.” ' 

“You should worry. After 
practically a honeymoon with 
yojir Terran popsy.” 

“Anyway, it’s certainly going 
to work. You can’t wallow in 
your great age if you know 
there’s someone older than you.” 
“But there isn’t. We invented 
Aidan. It’s another artificial so- 
lution to their self-imposed prob- 
lem. Just another, like the scores 
of others they’ve been trying un- 
successfully for years.” 

“Artificial maybe,” said Tom 
complacently, “but the point is 
it’s an outside solution. You 
can’t raise yourself by your own 
bootstraps — but somebody else 
can!"

A BAD DAY 
FOR VERMIN 

BY KEITH LAUMER 

They came in friendship 
and love. They couldn't 
help the way they looked l 



Judge Carter Gates of the 
" Third Circuit Court finished 
his chicken salad on whole 
wheat, thoughtfully crumpled 
the waxed paper bag and turned 
to drop it in the waste basket 
behind his chair — and sat trans- 
fixed. 

Through his second-floor of- 
fice window, he saw a forty-foot 
flower-petal shape of pale tur- 
quoise settling gently between 
the well -tended petunia beds on 
the court-house lawn. On the up- 
per, or stem end of the vessel, a 
translucent pink panel popped 
up and a slender, graceful form 



not unlike a large violet cater- 
pillar undulated into view. 

Judge Gates whirled to the 
telephone. Half an hour later, 
he put it to the officials gather- 
ed with him in a tight group 
on the lawn. 

“Boys, this thing is intelligent; 
any fool can see that. It’s putting 
together what my boy assures 
me is some kind of talking ma- 
chine, and any minute now it’s 
going to start communicating. 
It’s been twenty minutes since I 
notified Washington on this 
thing. It won’t be long before 
somebody back there decides this

is top secret and slaps a freeze 
on us here that will make the 
Manhattan Project look like a 
publicity campaign. Now, I say 
this is the biggest thing that ever 
happened to Plum County — but 
if we don’t aim to be put right 
out of the picture, we’d better 
move fast.” 

“What you got in mind, Jedge?” 

“I propose we hold an open 
hearing right here in the court- 
house, the minute that thing gets 
its gear to working. We’ll put it 
on the air — Tom Clembers from 
the radio station’s already string- 
ing wires, I see. Too bad we’ve 
got no TV equipment, but Jody 
Hurd has a movie camera. We’ll 
put Willow Grove on the map 
bigger’n Cape Canaveral ever 
was.” 

“We’re with you on that,' Car- 
ter!” 

Ten minutes after the melodi- 
ous voice of the Fianna’s trans- 
lator had requested escort to the 
village headman, the visitor was 
looking over the crowded court- 
room with an expression remini- 
scent of a St Bernard puppy 
hoping for a romp. The rustle 
of feet and throat-clearing sub- 
sided and the speaker began: 

• “People of the Green World, 
happy the cycle — ” 

Heads turned at the clump of 
feet coming down the side aisle; 
a heavy-torsoed man of middle 
age, bald, wearing a khaki shirt 

36 



and trousers and rimless glasses 
and with a dark leather holster 
slapping his hip at each step, 
cleared the end of the front row 
of seats, planted himself, feet 
apart, yanked a heavy nickel- 
plated .44 revolver from the hol- 
ster, took aim and fired five 
shots into the body of the Fianna 
at a range of ten feet. 

The violet form whipped con- 
vulsively, writhed from the 
bench to the floor with a sound 
like a wet fire hose being 
dropped, uttered a gasping twit- 
ter, and lay still. The gunman 
turned, dropped the pistol, threw 
up his hands, and called: 

“Sheriff Hoskins, I’m puttin 
myself in yer perfective custody.” 

'T'here was a moment of stun- 
ned silence; then a rush of 
spectators for the alien. The 
sheriffs three - hundred - and - 
nine-pound bulk bellied through 
the shouting mob to take up a 
stand before the khaki-clad man. 

“I always knew you was a 
mean one, Cecil Stump,” he said, 
unlimbering handcuffs, “ever 
since I seen you makin’ up them 
ground-glass baits for Joe Pot- 
ter’s dog. But I never thought 
I’d see you turn to cold-blooded 
murder.” He waved at the by- 
standers. “Clear a path through 
here; I’m takin’ my prisoner 
over to the jail.” 

“Jest a dad-blamed minute,

Sheriff.” Stump’s face was pale, 
his glasses were gone and one 
khaki shoulder strap dangled — 
but what was almost a grin twist- 
ed one meaty cheek. He hid his 
hands behind his back, leaned 
away from the cuffs. “I don’t 
like that word ‘prisoner’. I ast 
you fer perfection. And better 
look out who you go throwin’ 
that word ‘murder’ off at, too. I 
ain’t murdered nobody.” 

The sheriff blinked, turned to 
roar, “How’s the victim, Doc?” 
A small gray head rose from 
bending over the limp form of 
the Fianna. “Deader’n a mack- 
erel, Sheriff.” 

“I guess that’s it. Let’s go, 
Cecil.” 

“What’s the charge?” 

“First degree murder.” 
“Who’d I murder?” 

“Why, you killed this here . 
this stranger.” 

“That ain’t no stranger. That’s 
a varmint. Murder’s got to do 
with killin’ humems, way I un- 
derstand it. You goin’ to tell me 
that thing’s humem?” 

Ten people shouted at once: 
“ — human as I am!” 

“ — intelligent being!” 

“ — tell me you can simply 
kill—” 

“ — must be some kind of 
law — ” 

The sheriff raised his hands, 
his jowls drawn down in a scowl. 
“What about it, Judge Gates? 



Any law against Cecil Stump 
killing the . uh . ?” 

The judge thrust out his lower 
lip. “Well, let’s see,” he began. 
“Technically — ” 

“Good Lord!” someone blurt- 
ed. “You mean the laws on mur- 
der don’t define what constitutes 
— I mean, what — ” 

“What a humem is?” Stump 
snorted. “Whatever it says, it 
sure-bob don’t include no purple 
worms. That’s a varmint, pure 
and simple. Ain’t no different 
killin’ it than any other critter.” 
“Then, by God, we’ll get him 
for malicious damage,” a man 
called. “Or hunting without a 
license — out of season!” 

“ — carrying concealed weap- 
ons!” 

Stump went for his hip pocket, 
fumbled out a fat, shapeless 
"wallet, extracted a thumbed rec- 
tangle of folded paper, offered 
it. 

“I’m a licensed exterminator. 
Got a permit to carry the gun, 
too. I ain’t broken no law.” He 
grinned openly now. “Jest doin’ 
my job, Sheriff. And at no 
charge to the county.” 

\ smaller man with bristly red 
hair flared his nostrils at 
Stump. “You blood-thirsty 
idiot!” He raised a fist and shook 
it. “We’ll be a national disgrace 
— worse than Little Rock! 
Lynching’s too good for you!” 



A BAD DAY FOR VERMIN

“Hold on there, Weinstein,” 
the sheriff cut in. “Let’s not go 
gettin’ no lynch talk started.” 
“Lynch, is it!” Cecil Stump 
bellowed, his face suddenly red. 
“Why, I done a favor for every 
man here! Now you listen to 
me! What is that thing over 
there?” He jerked a blunt thumb 
toward the judicial bench. “It’s 
some kind of critter from Mars 
or someplace — you know that 
as well as me! And what’s it 
here for? It ain’t for the good 
of the likes of you and me, I can 
tell you that. It’s them or us. 
And this time, by God, we got 
in the first lick!” 

“Why you . you . hate- 
monger!” 

“Now, hold on right there. I’m 
as liberal-minded as the next 
feller. Hell, I like a nigger — 
and I can’t hardly tell a Jew 
from a white man. But when it 
comes to takin’ in a damned pur- 
ple worm and callin’ it humem 
— that’s where I draw the line.” 
Sheriff Hoskins pushed be- 
tween Stump and the surging 
front rank of the crowd. “Stay 
back there! I want you to dis- 
perse, peaceably, and let the law 
handle this.” 

“I reckon I’ll push off now, 
Sheriff,” Stump hitched up his 
belt. “I figgered you might have 
to calm ’em down right at first, 
but now they’ve had a chance 
to think it over and see I ain’t 



broken no law, ain’t none of 
these law-abiding folks going to 
do anything illegal — like tryin’ 
to get rough with a licensed ex- 
terminator just doin’ his job.” 
He stooped, retrieved his gun. 

“Here, I’ll take that,” Sheriff 
Hoskins said. “You can consider 
your gun license canceled — and 
your exterminatin’ license, too.” 
Stump grinned again, handed 
the revolver over. 

“Sure. I’m cooperative, Sher- 
iff. Anything you say. Send it 
around to my place when you’re 
done with it.” He pushed his way 
through the crowd to the corri- 
dor door. 

“The rest of you stay put!” a 
portly man with a head of bushy 
white hair pushed his way 
through to the bench. “I’m call- 
ing an emergency Town Meet- 
ing to order here and now!” 

TTe banged the gavel on the 
-*• scarred bench top, glanced 
down at the body of the dead 
alien, now covered by a flag. 

“Gentlemen, we’ve got to take 
fast action. If the wire services 
get hold of this before we’ve 
gone on record. Willow Grove’ll 
be a blighted area.” 

“Look here, Willard,” Judge 
Gates called, rising. “This — this 
mob isn’t competent to take legal 
action.” 

“Never mind what’s legal, 
Judge. Sure, this calls for Fed- 



38 



GALAXY 



eral legislation — maybe a Con- 
stitutional amendment — but in 
the meantime, we’re going to re- 
define what constitutes a person 
within the incorporated limits of 
Willow Grove!” 

“That’s the least we can do,” 
a thin-faced woman snapped, 
glaring at Judge Gates. “Do you 
think we’re going to set here and 
condone this outrage?” 

“Nonsense!” Gates shouted. “I 
don’t like what happened any 
better than you do — but a per- 
son — well, a person’s got two 
arms and two legs and — ” 
“Shape’s got nothing to do 
with it,” the chairman cut in. 
“Bears walk on two legs! Dave 
Zawocky lost his in the war. 
Monkeys have hands.” 

“Any intelligent creature — ” 
the woman started. 

“Nope, that won’t do, either; 
my unfortunate cousin’s boy 
Melvin was born an imbecile, 
poor lad. Now, folks, there’s no 
time to waste. We’ll find it very 
difficult to formulate a satisfac- 
tory definition based on consid- 
erations such as these. However, 
I think we can resolve the ques- 
tion in terms that will form a 
basis for future legislation on 
the question. It’s going to make 
some big changes in things. Hun- 
ters aren’t going to like it — and 
the meat industry will be affect- 
ed. But if, as it appears, we’re 
entering into an era of contact 



with . ah . creatures from 
other worlds, we’ve got to get 
our house in order.” 

“You tell ’em, Senator!” some- 
one yelled. 

“We better leave this for Con- 
gress to figger out!” another 
voice insisted. 

“We got to do something. 

The senator held up his hands. 
“Quiet, everybody. There’ll be 
reporters here in a matter of 
minutes. Maybe our ordinance 
won’t hold water. But it’ll start 
’em thinking — and it’ll make a 
lots better copy for Willow 
Grove than the killing.” 

“What you got in mind, Sena- 
tor?” 

“Just this:” the Senator said 
solemnly. “A person is . any 
harmless creature . .” 

Feet shuffled. Someone cough- 
ed. 

“What about a man who com- 
mits a violent act, then?” Judge 
Gates demanded. “What’s he, 
eh?” 

“That’s obvious, gentlemen,” 
the senator said flatly. “He’s 
vermin.” 

/"'vn the courthouse steps Cecil 
^ Stump stood, hands in hip 
pockets, talking to a reporter 
from the big-town paper in Mat- 
toon, surrounded by a crowd of 
late-comers who had missed the 
excitement inside. He described 
the accuracy of his five shots. 



A BAD DAY FOR VERMIN

the sound they had made hitting 
the big blue snake, and the ludi- 
crous spectacle the latter had 
presented in its death agony. He 
winked at a foxy man in over- 
alls picking his nose at the edge 
of the crowd. 

“Guess it’ll be a while ’fore 
any more damned reptiles move 
in here like they owned the 
place,” he concluded. 

The courthouse doors banged 
wide; excited citizens poured 
forth, veering aside from Cecil 
Stump. The crowd around him 
thinned, broke up as its mem- 
bers collared those emerging 
with the hot news. The reporter 
picked a target. 

“Perhaps you’d care to give 
me a few details of the action 
taken by the . ah . Special 
Committee, sir?” 

Senator Custis pursed his lips. 
“A session of the Town Council 
was called,” he said. “We’ve de- 
fined what a person is in this 
town—” 

Stump, standing ten feet away, 



snorted. “Can’t touch me with 
no ex post factory law.” 

“ — and also what can be clas- 
sified as vermin,” Custis went on. 

Stump closed his mouth with 
a snap. 

“Here, that s’posed to be some 
kind of slam at me, Custis? By 
God, come election time. .” 

Above, the door opened again. 
A tall man in a leather jacket 
stepped out, stood looking down. 
The crowd pressed back. Senator 
Custis and the reporter moved 
aside. The newcomer came down 
the steps slowly. He carried Cecil 
Stump’s nickel-plated .44 in his 
hand. 

Standing alone now, Stump 
watched him. 

“Here,” he said. His voice car- 
ried a sudden note of strain. 
“Who’re you?” 

The man reached the foot of 
the steps, raised the revolver and 
cocked it with a thumb. 

“I’m the new exterminator,” 
he said.

WAR 

BY KRIS NEVILLE 

KLUSTRATED BY GUINTA 

He was Earth's secret 
weapon, as deadly as a 
sword— and two-edged! 



I 

nphe year was 2346, and Earth, 
at the time, was a political 
democracy. 

The population was ruled by 
the Over-Council and, in order 
of decreasing importance, by 
Councils, and Local Councils. 
Each was composed of repre- 
sentatives duly apportioned by 
popular vote between the two 
contending parties. Executive di- 
rection was provided by a vari- 



ety of Secretaries, selected by 
vote of the appropriate Councils. 
An independent Judiciary up- 
held the laws. 

A unified Earth sent colonists 
to the stars. Back came strange 
tales and improbable animals. 

Back, too, came word of a bur- 
geoning technological civiliza- 
tion on the planet Itra, peopled 
by entirely humanoid aliens. 

Earth felt it would be wise for 
Itra to join in a Galactic Federa- 
tion and accordingly, submitted 



41 



the terms of such a mutually ad- 
vantageous agreement. 

The Itraians declined. 

S pace Captain Merle S. Shaef- 
fer, the youngest and perhaps 
the most naive pilot for Trans- 
Universe Transport, was called 
unexpectedly to the New York 
office of the company. 

When Capt. Shaeffer entered 
the luxurious eightieth story 
suite, Old Tom Twilmaker, the 
President of TUT, greeted him. 
With an arm around his shoul- 
der, Old Tom led Capt. Shaeffer 
to an immense inner office and 
introduced him to a General 
Reuter, identified as the Chair- 
man of the Interscience Com- 
mittee of the Over-Council. 

No one else was present. With 
the door closed, they were iso- 
lated in Olympian splendor 
above and beyond the affairs of 
men. Here judgments were final 
and impartial. Capt. Shaeffer, in 
the presence of two of the men 
highest in the ruling councils of 
Earth, was reduced to incoherent 
awe. 

General Reuter moved about 
restlessly. Old Tom was serene 
and beatific. 

• When they were seated. Old 
Tom swiveled around and gazed 
long in silence across the spires 
of the City. Capt. Shaeffer wait- 
ed respectfully. General Reuter 
fidgetted. 



“Some day,” Old Tom said at 
last, “I’m going to take my leave 
of this. Yes, gentle Jesus! Oh, 
when I think of all the souls 
still refusing to admit our pre- 
cious Savior, what bitterness, oh, 
what sorrow is my wealth to me! 
Look down upon the teeming 
millions below us. How many 
know not the Lord? Yes, some 
morning, I will forsake all this 
and go out into the streets to 
spend my last days bringing the 
words of hope to the weary and 
oppressed. Are you a Christian, 
Merle?” 

General Reuter cracked his 
knuckles nervously while Capt. 
Shaeffer muttered an embar- 
rassed affirmative. 

“I am a deeply religious man,” 
Old Tom continued. “I guess 
you’ve heard that, Merle?” 

“Yes sir,” Capt. Shaeffer said. 

“But did you know that the 
Lord has summoned you here to- 
day?” Old Tom asked. 

“No, sir,” Capt. Shaeffer said. 

“General Reuter, here, is a 
dear friend. We’ve known each 
other, oh, many years. Distantly 
related through our dear wives, 
in fact. And we serve on the 
same Board of Directors and the 
same Charity Committees. A 
few weeks ago, when he asked 
me for a man, I called for your 
file. Merle. I made discreet in- 
quiries. Then I got down on my 
knees and talked it over with 



42 



GALAXY 



God for, oh, it must have been 
all of an hour. I asked, ‘Is this 
the man?’ And I was given a 
sign. Yes! At that moment, a 
shaft of sunlight broke through 
the clouds!” 

G eneral Reuter had continued 
his n e r'v o u s movements 
throughout the speech. For the 
first time, he spoke. “Good God, 
Tom, serve us a drink.” He turn- 
ed to Capt. Shaeffer. “A little 
drink now and then helps a 
man relax. I’ll just have mine 
straight, Tom.” 

Old Tom studied Capt. Shaef- 
fer. “I do not feel the gentle 
Master approves of liquor.” 
“Don’t try to influence him,” 
General Reuter said. “You’re 
embarrassing the boy.” 

“I — ” Capt. Shaeffer began. 
“Give him the drink. If he 
doesn’t want to drink it, he 
won’t have to drink it.” 

Sighing, Old Tom poured two 
bourbons from the bar in back 
of his desk and passed them over. 
Martyrdom sat heavily upon his 
brow. 

After a quick twist of the wrist 
and an expert toss of the head, 
General Reuter returned an emp- 
ty glass. “Don’t mind if I do 
have another,” he said. He was 
already less restless. 

“How’s your ability to pick up 
languages?” General Reuter 
asked. 



"I learned Spanish and Rus- 
sian at TUT PS,” Capt. Shaeffer 
said apologetically. “I’m sup- 
posed to have a real high apti- 
tude in languages, according to 
some tests I took. In case we 
should meet intelligent aliens, 
TUT gives them.” 

“You got no association with 
crackpot organizations, anything 
like that?” General Reuter ask- 
ed. “You’re either a good Liber- 
al-Conservative or Radical-Pro- 
gressive, aren’t you? I don’t care 
which. I don’t believe in prying 
into a man’s politics.” 

“I never belonged to any- 
thing,” Capt. Shaeffer said. 

“Oh, I can assure you, that’s 
been checked out very, very 
thoroughly,” Old Tom said. 

The General signaled for an- 
other drink. With a sigh of ex- 
asperation, Old Tom complied. 

“Bob,” Old Tom said, “I really 
think you’ve had enough. Please, 
now. Our Master counsels mod- 
eration.” 

“Damn it, Tom,” the General 
said and turned back to the space 
pilot. “May have a little job for 
you.” 

Old Tom shook his head at 
the General, cautioning him. 

“Actually,” the General said, 
ignoring the executive, “we’ll be 
sort of renting you from TUT. 
In a way you’ll still be working 
for them. I can get a million 
dollars out of the — ”

“Bob!” 

“ — unmarked appropriation if 
it goes in in TUT’s name. No 
questions asked. National De- 
fense. I couldn’t get anywhere 
near that much for an individual 
for a year. It gives us a pie to 
slice. We were talking about it 
before you came in. How does a 
quarter of a million dollars a 
year sound to you?” 

“When it comes to such mat- 
ters,” Old Tom interjected hast- 
ily, “I think first of the oppor- 
tunities they bring to do good.” 
The General continued, “Now 
you know, Merle. And this is 
serious. I want you to listen to 
me. Because this comes under 
World Security laws, and I'm go- 
ing to bind you to them. You 
know what that means? You’ll 
be held responsible.” 

“Yes, sir,” Merle said, swal- 
lowing stiffly. “I understand.” 
“Good. Let’s have a drink on 
that.” 

(( T)lease be quiet, General,” 
-*■ Old Tom said. “Let me ex- 
plain. You see, Merle, the Inter- 
science Committee was recently 
directed to consider methods for 
creating a climate of opinion on 
Itra — of which I’m sure you’ve 
heard — which would be favor- 
able to the proposed Galactic 
Federation.” 

“Excuse me,” General Reuter 
said. “They don’t have a demo-

cracy. like we do. They don’t 
have any freedom like we do. I 
have no doubt the average what- 
everyoucallem — Itraians, I 
guess — the average gooks — 
would be glad to see us come in 
and just kick the hell out of 
whoever is in charge of them.” 

“Now, General,” Old Tom said 
more sharply. 

“But that’s not the whole 
thing,” the General continued. 
“Even fit were right thing to do, 
an’ I’m not saying isn’t — right 
thing to do — there’s log-lo-lo- 
gistics. I don’t want to convey 
the impresh, impression that our 
Defense Force people have been 
wasting money. Never had as 
much as needed, fact. No, it’s 
like this. 

“We have this broad base to 
buil’ from. Backbone. But we live 
in a democracy. Now, Old Tom’s 
Liberal-Conservative. And me, 
I’m Radical-Progresshive. But 
we agree on one thing: impor- 
tance of strong defense. A lot of 
people don’ understan’ this. Feel 
we’re already spendin’ more 
than we can afford. But I want 
to ask them, what’s more impor- 
tant than the defense of our 
planet?” 

“General, I’m afraid this is 
not entirely germane,” Old Tom 
said stiffly. 

“Never mind that right now. 
Point is, it will take us long 
time to get the serious nature of 



the menace of Itra across to the 
voters. Then, maybe fifteen, 
twenty years. Let’s just take 
one thing. We don’t have any- 
where near enough troop trans- 
ports to carry out the occupa- 
tion of Itra. You know how long 
it takes to build them? My point 
is, we may not have that long. 
Suppose Itra should get secret of 
interstellar drive tomorrow, then 
where would we be?” 

Old Tom slammed his fist on 
the desk. “General, please! The 
boy isn’t interested in all that.” 

The General surged angrily to 
his feet. “By God, that’s what’s 
wrong with this world today!” 
he cried. “Nobody’s interested in 
Defense. Spend only a measly 
twenty per cent of the Gross 
World Product on Defense, and 
expect to keep strong! Good 
God, Tom, give me a drink!” 
Apparently heresy had shocked 
him sober. 

Old Tom explained, “The Gen- 
eral is a patriot. We all respect 
him for it.” 

“I understand,” Capt. Shaef- 
fer said. 

General Reuter hammered his 
knuckles in rhythm on the table. 
“The drink, the drink, the 
drink! You got more in the bot- 
tle. I saw it!” 

Old Tom rolled his eyes Heav- 
enward and passed the bottle 
across. “This is all you get. This 
is all I’ve got.” 



46 



GALAXY 



II 



The General held the bottle 
up to the light. “Should have 
brought my own. Let’s hurry up 
and get this over with.” 

Old Tom smiled the smile of the 
sorely beset and persecuted and 
said, “You see, Merle, there’s 
massive discontent among the 
population of Itra. We feel we 
should send a man to the planet 
to, well, foment change and, uh, 
hasten the already inevitable 
overthrow of the despotic gov- 
ernment. That man will be strict- 
ly on his own. The Government 
will not be able to back him in 
any way whatsoever once he 
lands on Itra.” 

The General had quickly fin- 
ished the bottle. “You she,” he 
interrupted, “there’s one thing 
they can’t fight, an’ that’s an 
idea. Jus’ one man goes to Itra 
with the idea of Freedom, that’s 
all it’ll take. How many men did 
it take to start the ’Merican Rev- 
olution? Jefferson. The Russian 
Revolution? Marx!” 

“Yes,” Old Tom said. “One de- 
dicated man on Itra, preaching 
the ideas of Liberty — liberty 
with responsibility and property 
rights under one God. That man 
can change a world.” Exhausted 
by the purity of his emotions, 
Old Tom sat back gasping to 
await the answer. 

“A quarter of a million dol- 
lars a year?” Capt. Shaeffer ask- 
ed at length. 



nr'he Itraians spoke a common 
language. It was somewhat 
guttural and highly inflected. 
Fortunately, the spelling appear- 
ed to be phonetic, with only for- 
ty-three characters being re- 
quired. As near as anyone could 
tell, centuries of worldwide com- 
munication had eliminated re- 
gional pecularities. The speech 
from one part of Itra was not 
distinguishable from that of an- 
other part. 

Most of the language was re- 
covered from spy tapes of tele- 
vision programs. A dictionary 
was compiled laborously by a 
special scientific task force of 
the Over-Council. The overall 
program was directed and ad- 
ministered by Intercontinental 
Iron, Steel, Gas, Electricity, Au- 
tomobiles and Synthetics, In- 
corporated. 

It took Shaeffer just short of 
three years to speak Itraian suf- 
ficiently well to convince non- 
Itraians that he spoke without 
accent. 

The remainder of his training 
program was administered by a 
variety of other large industrial 
concerns. The training was con- 
ducted at a Defense Facility. 

At the end of his training, 
Shaeffer was taken by special 
bus to the New Mexican space 
port. A ship waited. 



SHAMAR'S WAR 



47 



The car moved smoothly from 
the Defense Force Base, down 
the broad sixteen-lane highway, 
through the surrounding slum 
area and into Grants. 

Sight of the slums gave Shaef- 
fer mixed emotions. 

It was not a feeling of superi- 
ority to the inhabitants; those 
he had always regarded with a 
circumspect indifference. The 
slums were there. He supposed 
they always would be there. But 
now, for the first time in his life, 
he could truly say that he had 
escaped their omnipresent threat 
once and for all. He felt relief 
and guilt. 

During the last three years, he 
had earned $750,000. 

As a civilian stationed on a 
Defense Force Base, he had, of 
course, to pay for his clothing, 
his food and his lodging. But 
the charge was nominal. Since 
he had been given only infre- 
quent and closely supervised 
leaves, he had been able to 
spend, altogether, only $12,000. 

Which meant that now, after 
taxes, he had accumulated in his 
savings account a total of nearly 
$60,000 awaiting his return from 
Itra. 

Qhaeffer’s ship stood off Itra 
while he prepared to disem- 
bark. 

In his cramped quarters, he 
dressed himself in Itraian-style 

48 



clothing. Capt. Merle S. Shaeffer 
became Shamar the Worker. 

In addition to his jump equip- 
ment, an oxygen cylinder, a face 
mask and a shovel, he carried 
with him eighty pounds of coun- 
terfeit Itraian currency ... all 
told, forty thousand individual 
bills of various denominations. 
Earth felt this would be all he 
needed to survive in a techno- 
logically advanced civilization. 

His plan was as follows: 

1. He was to land in a sparse- 
ly inhabited area on the larger 
masses. 

2. He was to procure trans- 
portation to Xxla, a major city, 
equivalent to London or Tokyo. 
It was the headquarters for the 
Party. 

3. He was to establish resi- 
dence in the slum area surround- 
ing the University of Xxla. 

4. Working through student 
contacts, he was to ingratiate 
himself with such rebel intellect- 
uals as could be found. 

5. Once his contacts were se- 
cure, he was to assist in the pre- 
paration of propaganda and es- 
tablish a clandestine press for 
its production. 

6. As quickly as the operation 
was self-sufficient, he was to 
move on to another major city 
— and begin all over. 

The ship descended into the 
atmosphere. The bell rang. Sha- 
mar the Worker seated himself. 



GALAXY 



put on his oxygen mask and sig- 
naled his readiness. He breathed 
oxygen. The ship quivered, the 
door fell away beneath him and 
he was battered unconscious by 
the slipstream. 

Five minutes later, pinwheel- 
ing lazily in free fall, he opened 
his eyes. For an instant’s panic 
he could not read the altimeter. 
Then seeing that he was safe, he 
noted his physical sensations. He 
was extremely cold. Gyrating 
wildly, he beat his chest to re- 
store circulation. 

He stabilized his fall by 
stretching out his hands. He 
floated with no sensation of 
movement. Itra was overhead, 
falling up at him slowly. He 
turned his back to the planet 
and checked the time. Twelve 
minutes yet to go. 

He spent, in all, seventeen 
minutes in free fall. At 2000 feet, 
he opened his parachute. The 
sound was like an explosion. 

He floated quietly, recovering 
from the shock. He removed his 
oxygen mask and tasted the alien 
air. He sniffed several times. It 
was not unpleasant. 

Below was darkness. Then sud- 
denly the ground came floating 
up and hit him. 

The terrain was irregular. He 
fought the chute to collapse it, 
tripped, and twisted his ankle 
painfully. 

The chute lay quiet and he sat 



on the ground and cursed in 
English. 

At length he bundled up the 
chute and removed all of the 
packages of money but the one 
disguised as a field pack. He 
used the shovel to dig a shallow 
grave at the base of a tree. He 
interred the chute, the oxygen 
cylinder, the mask, the shovel 
and scooped dirt over them with 
his hands. 

He sat down and unlaced his 
shoe and found his ankle badly 
swollen. Distant, unfamiliar 
odors filled him with apprehen- 
sion and he started at the slight- 
est sound. 

Dawn was breaking. 

Ill 

X Toting his bearings carefully, 

^ he hobbled painfully west- 
ward, with thirty pounds of 
money on his back. He would 
intersect the major North-South 
Intercontinental highway by at 
least noon. 

Two hours later, he came to 
a small plastic cabin in a clear- 
ing at the edge of a forest. 

Wincing now with each step, 
he made his way to the door. 
He knocked. 

There was a long wait. 

The door opened. A girl stood 
before him in a dressing gown. 
She frowned and asked, “Itsil 
obwatly jei gekompilp?” 



SHAMAR'S WAR 



49 



Hearing Itarian spoken by a 
native in the flesh had a power- 
ful emotional impact on Sha- 
mar the Worker. 

Stumblingly, he introduced 
himself and explained that he 
was camping out. During the 
previous night he had become 
lost and injured his ankle. If 
she could spare him food and di- 
rections, he would gladly pay. 

With a smile of superiority, 
she stepped aside and said in 
Itraian, “Come in, Chom the 
Worker.” 

He felt panic, but he choked 
it back and followed her. Ap- 
parently he had horribly mis- 
pronounced his own name. It 
was as though, in English he had 
said Barchestershire for Barset. 
He cursed whatever Professor 
had picked that name for what- 
ever obscure reason. 

“Sit down,” she invited. “I’m 
about to have breakfast. Eggs 
and bacon — ” the Itraian equi- 
valent — “if that’s all right with 
you. I’m Garfling Germadpoldlt 
by the way, although you can 
call me Ge-Ge.” 

The food was quite unpleas- 
ant, as though overly ripe. He 
was able to choke down the eggs 
with the greatest difficulty. For- 
tunately, the hot drink that was 
the equivalent of Earth coffee 
at the end of the meal, was suf- 
ficently spicy to quiet his stom- 
ach. 



“Good coffee,” he said. 
“Thank you. Care for a ciga- 
rette?” 

“I sure would.” 

He had no matches, so she lit 
it for him, hovering above him 
a moment, leaving with him the 
fresh odor of her hair. 

The taste of the cigarette was 
mild. Rather surprisingly, it sub- 
stituted for nicotine and allayed 
the sharp longing that had come 
with the coffee. 

“Let’s look at your ankle,” she 
said. She knelt at his feet and 
began to unlace the right shoe. 
“My, it’s swollen,” she said sym- 
pathetically. 

He winced as she touched it 
and then he reddened with em- 
barrassment. He had been walk- 
ing across dusty country. He 
drew back the foot and bent to 
restrain her. 

Playfully she slapped his hand 
away. “You sit back! I’ll get it. 
I’ve seen dirty feet before.” 

She pulled off the shoe and 
peeled off the sock. “Oh, God, 
it is swollen,” she said. “You 
think it’s broken, Shamar?” 
“Just sprained.” 

“I’ll get some hot water with 
some MedAid in it, and that’ll 
take the swelling out.” 

When he had his foot in the 
water, she sat across from him 
and arranged her dressing gown 
with a coquettish gesture. She 
caught him staring at the ear-

ring, and one hand went to it 
caressingly. She smiled that uni- 
versal feminine smile of security 
and recklessness, of invitation 
and rejection. 

“You’re engaged,” he noted. 

She opened her eyes wide and 
studied him above a thumbnail 
which she tasted with her teeth. 
“I’m engaged to Von Stutsman 
— ” as the name might be trans- 
lated — “perhaps you’ve heard of 
him? He’s important in the 
Party. You know him?” 

“No.” 

“You in the Party?” she said. 
She was teasing him now. Then, 
suddenly: “Neither am I, but I 
guess I’ll have to join if I be- 
come Mrs. Von Stutsman.” 

They were silent for a moment. 

Then she spoke, and he was 
frozen in terror, all thoughts but 
of self-preservation washed from 
his mind. 

“Your accent is unbelieveably 
bad,” she said. 

“I’m from Zuleb,” he said 
lamely, at last. 

“Meta — Gelwhops — or even 
Karkeqwol, that makes no dif- 
ference. Nobody on Itra speaks 
like you do. So you must be from 
that planet that had the Party in 
a flap several years ago — Earth, 
isn’t it?” 

He said nothing. 

“Do you know what they’ll do 
when they catch you?” she 
asked. 



“No,” he said hollowly. 
“They’ll behead you.” 

S he laughed, not unkindly. “If 
you could see yourself! How 
ridiculous you look, Shamar. I 
wonder what your real name is, 
by the way? Sitting with a foot 
in the water and looking wildly 
about. Here, let me fix more cof- 
fee and we can talk.” 

She called cheerily over her 
shoulder, “You’re safe here. No 
one will be by. I’m not due back 
until Tuesday.” 

She brought him a steaming 
mug. “Drink this while I dress.” 
She disappeared into the bed- 
room. He heard the shower run- 
ning. 

He sat waiting, numb and des- 
perate, and drank the coffee be- 
cause it was there. His thoughts 
scampered in the cage of his 
skull like mice on a treadmill. 

When Ge-Ge came back, he 
had still not resolved the con- 
flict within him. She stood bare- 
foot upon the rug and looked 
down at him, hunched miserably 
over the pan of water, now luke- 
warm. 

“How’s the foot?” 

“All right.” 

“Want to take it out?” 

“I guess.” 

“I’ll get a towel.” 

She waited until he had dried 
the foot and restored the sock 
and shoe. The swelling was gone.

He stood up and put his weight 
on it. He smiled wanly. “It’s 
okay now. It’s not broken, I 
guess.” 

She gestured him to the sofa. 
He complied. 

“What’s in the field pack?” 
she asked. “Money? How 
much?” She moved toward it. 
He half rose to stop her, but by 
then she had it partly open. 
“My,” she said, bringing out a 
thick sheaf of bills. She rippled 
them sensuously. “Pretty. Very, 
very pretty.” She examined them 
for texture and appearance. 
“They look good, Shamar. Ill 
bet it would cost ten million 
dollars in research on paper and 
ink and presses to do this kind 
of a job. Only another govern- 
ment has got that kind of money 
to throw around.” She tossed the 
currency carelessly beside him 
and came to sit at his side. 

She took his hand. Her hand 
was warm and gentle. “Tell me, 
Shamar,” she said. “Tell me all 
about it.” 

So this is how easily spies are 
trapped in real life, Shamar told 
himself with numb disbelief. 

The story came out slowly and 
hesistantly at first. She said 
nothing until he had finished. 

“And that’s all? You really 
believe that, don’t you? And I 
guess your government does, too. 
That all we need is just some 
little idea or something.” She 



turned away from him. “But of 
course, that’s neither here nor 
there, is it? I never imagined 
an adventurer type would look 
like you. You have such a soft, 
honest voice. As a little girl, I 
pictured myself being carried 
off by a tanned desert sheik on 
a camel; and oh, he was lean 
and handsome! With dark flash- 
ing eyes and murderously heavy 
lips and hands like iron! Well, 
that’s life, I guess.” She stood and 
paced the room. “Let me think. 
We’ll pick up a flyer in Zelonip 
when we catch the bus next 
Tuesday. How much does the 
money weigh?” 

“Eighty pounds.” 

“I can carry about 10 pounds 
in my bag. You can take your 
field pack. How much is in it? 
Thirty pounds? That’ll leave 
about forty which we can ship 
through on extra charges. Then, 
when we get to Xxla, I can hide 
you out in an apartment over 
on the East side.” 

“Why would you run a risk 
like that for me?” he asked. 

Qhe brushed the hair from her 
^ face. “Let’s say — what? I 
don’t really think you can make 
it, because it’s so hopeless. But 
maybe, just maybe, you might 
be one of the rare ones who, if 
he plays his cards right, can beat 
the system. I love to see them 
licked!

GALAXY 



“Well, I’m a clerk. That’s all. 
Just a lowly clerk in one of the 
Party offices. I met Von Stuts- 
man a year ago. This is his cabin. 
He lets me use it. 

“He’s older than I am; but 
there’s worse husband material. 
But then again, he’s about to be 
transferred to one of the big 
agricultural combines way out 
in the boondocks where there’s 
no excitement at all. Just little 
old ladies and little old men and 
peasants having children. 

“I’m a city girl. I like Xxla. 
And if I marry him, all that goes 
up the flue. I’ll be marooned 
with him, God knows where, for 
years. Stuck, just stuck. 

“Still — he is Von Stutsman, 
and he’s on his way up. Every- 
one says that. Ten, twenty years, 
he’ll be back to Xxla, and he’ll 
come back on top. 

“Oh ... I don’t know what I 
want to do! If I marry him, I 
can get all the things I’ve always 
wanted. Position, security. He’s 
older than I am, but he’s really 
a nice guy. It’s just that he’s 
dull. He can’t talk about any- 
thing but Party, Party, Party. 

“That’s what I came out to this 
cabin for. To think things over, 
to try to get things straightened 
out. And then you came along. 
Maybe it gives me a chance for 
something exciting before I ship 
off to the boondocks. Does that 
make sense to you? 



“I’ll get married and sit out 
there, and I’ll turn the pages of 
the Party magazine and smile 
sweetly to myself. Because, you 
see, I’ll always be able to lean 
forward and say, ‘Dear? Once 
upon a time, I helped hide an 
Earth spy in Xxla.’ And that’ll 
knock that silly and self-satisfied 
look off his face for once. Oh, 
I don’t know! Let me alone!” 
With that, she fled to the bed- 
room and slammed the door be- 
hind her. 

He could hear her sobbing 
helplessly. 

In the afternoon, she came out. 
He had fallen asleep. She shook 
him gently to waken him. 

“Eh? Oh! Huh?” He smiled 
foolishly. 

“Wash up in there,” she told 
him. “I’m sorry I blew up on 
you this morning. I’ll cook some- 
thing.” 

When he came back, she was 
serving them their dinner on 
steaming platters. 

“Look, Ge-Ge,” he said over 
coffee. “You don’t like your gov- 
ernment. We’ll help you out. 
There’s this Galactic Federation 
idea.” He explained to her the 
crr'-s -fertilization of the two cul- 
tures. 

“Shamar, my friend,” she said, 
“did you see Earth’s proposal? 
There was nothing in it about 
giving us an interstellar drive. 
We were required to give Earth 



SHAMAR'S WAR

all transportation franchises. 
The organization you used to 
work for was to be given, as I 
remember it, an exclusive ninety- 
nine year right to carry all 
Earth-Itra commerce. It was all 
covered in the newspapers, didn’t 
you see it?” * 

Shamar said, “Well, now, I’m 
not familiar with the details. I 
wasn’t keeping up with them. 
But I’m sure these things could 
be, you know, worked out. May- 
be, for Security reasons, we 
didn’t want to give you the in- 
terstellar drive right off. but you 
can appreciate our logic there. 
Once we saw you were, well, like 
us, a peace-loving planet, once 
you’d changed your government 
to a democracy, you would see 
it our way and you’d have no 
complaints on that score.” 

“Let’s not talk politics,” she 
said wearily. “Maybe it’s what 
you say, and I’m just naturally 
suspicious. I don’t want to talk 
about it.” 

“Well, I was just trying to 
help — ” 

The sentence was interrupted 
by a monstrous explosion. 

“Good God!” Shamar cried. 
“What was that?” 

“Oh, that,” Ge-Ge said, shak- 
■ing off the effects. “They were 
probably testing one of their 
damned automated factories to 
see if it was explosion proof 
and it wasn’t.” 



Touring the week alone in the 
cabin, Ge-Ge fell in love with 
Shamar. 

“Oh, my God!” she cried. 
“What will I do when they catch 
you? I’ll die, Shamar! I couldn’t 
bear it. We’ll go to Xxla, we’ll 
hide away as quietly as two 
mice, somewhere. We won’t go 
out. The two of us, alone but 
together, behind closed doors 
and drawn shades. Nobody will 
ever know about us. We’ll be 
the invisible people.” 

Shamar protested. “I don’t see 
how we can ever be secure un- 
til something’s done about your 
government. As long as you 
don’t reach some kind of agree- 
ment with Earth, I’ll be an out- 
law. I’ll be afraid any minute 
they’ll tap my shoulder and 
come and take me away. I don’t 
think we could hold up under 
that. We’d be at each other in 
no time.” 

She wept quietly. 

The last day in the cabin, they 
went out and dug up the rest of 
the money. The trip to Xxla 
took place without incident. Ge- 
Ge rented an apartment for him, 
and he safely checked in. She 
went shopping for food and 
clothing. 

Thereafter she came nearly 
every evening. They would eat 
and she would reveal the incon- 



54 



GALAXY 



sequential details of the office 
regime to which she was daily 
exposed. After dinner, they 
would sit in the living room and 
practice Itraian and neck a little. 
Then she would go home. 

One day, after a month of this 
routine, she threw herself into 
his arms and sobbed, “I gave 
Von Stutsman back his earring 
today. It was the only fair thing 
to do. I’m afraid he knows about 
us. He’s had me watched. I know 
he has. I admitted it was an- 
other man.” 

Shamar held her tensely. 

She broke away. ‘‘You were 
born in Zuleb, you suffered am- 
nesia, you woke up in a ditch 
one morning without papers. 
You’ve been an itinerant work- 
er since. Things like that hap- 
pen all the time. You hit a big 
lottery ticket a few months ago. 
I told him that. How can he 
check it?” 

“You told him I didn’t have 
any papers?” * 

“Millions of people don’t have 
any papers — the drifters, 
people that do casual labor, the 
people that don’t work at all. 
The thing is, without papers he 
doesn’t have any way to check 
on you. Oh, you should have 
seen his face when I gave him 
back his earring. He was abso- 
lutely livid. I didn’t think he 
had it in him. I suppose I’ll 
have to quit my job now. Oh, 



if you only had papers so we 
could be married!” 

Ge-Ge’s mood, that evening, 
alternated between despair and 
optimism. In the end, she was 
moros and restless. She repeat- 
ed several times, “I just don’t 
know what’s going to happen to 
us.” 

“Ge-Ge,” he said, “I can’t 
spend my life in this apartment. 
I’ve got to get out.” 

“You’re mad.” She faced him 
from across the room. She stood 
with her legs apart, firmly set. 
“Well, I don’t care what happens 
any more. I can’t stand things 
to go on like they are. I’ll in- 
troduce you to some people I 
know, since you won’t be happy 
until I do. But God help us!” ' 

\ fter approving his accent, 
which had improved under 
her tutelage, Ge-Ge took him to 
a party the following Saturday. 

The party was held in an ill- 
lighted railroad flat. People con- 
gregated cross-legged on the 
bare floor. 

Shamar listened to a man com- 
plaining that citizens were be- 
ing taxed beyond all endurance 
to support the enforced automa- 
tion program. “They aren’t in- 
terested in building consumer 
goods. They’re interested in 
building factories to build con- 
sumer goods and blow them up 
testing them. Or the factories

55 



are always obsolete just as soon 
as they finish them, and they 
can’t phase into their new pro- 
duction setup and Hundred Year 
Plan.” 

Ge-Ge whispered a warning to 
him to beware of spies. 

“Spies?” 

“The Party,” she said, draw- 
ing him to one side. 

“But — but — you mean the 
Party just lets people talk like 
this?” 

“Whatever harm does it do?” 
she asked. “Everybody benefits 
from talking out their aggres- 
sions. Now, have another drink 
and relax, and Shamar, be care- 
ful! Nobody minds local crack- 
pots, but nobody wants foreign 
crackpots!” 

She led him to another drink 
and left him standing with the 
host. 

“Nice party,” Shamar said. 

“Thank you,” the host said. “I 
find it very invigorating. As 
long as there’s still people that 
think and that criticize on this 
planet, I feel there’s hope, don’t 
you? This is your first time? I 
don’t recall your face. I have a 
study group that meets Wednes- 
day nights. You’re welcome to 
come. We have very stimulating 
discussions about government 
and politics. Please do come, any 
time you can. Just drop in any 
time after eight. What was your 
name again?” 



“Shamar the Worker.” 
“Interesting name,” the host 
said. “Another drink?” 

Later, Shamar found himself 
in an intense conversation with 
a bearded youth of perhaps sev- 
enteeen. 

“A guy’s responsible for his 
own conduct, right? Right! I’m 
responsible for their conduct? 
Each man goes to hell in his 
own way, right? Right! I don’t 
want anything to do with them. 
You can’t do anything about it, 
man, that’s what I’m telling you. 
I don’t seem to be getting 
through. Don’t you see, it’s a 
machine ...” 

“But if everybody joined the 
Party,” Shamar suggested. 

“So everybody joins? So 
what’s new? Okay, you vote in 
the Party elections. What do you 
get? You get these two guys run- 
ning for office: one is slightly 
left of center and one is slightly 
right of center. And both are 
four-square for the Automated 
Factory Program. Just suppose 
you did get a radical — suppose 
they accidentally let one slip 
through? He goes off and they 
argue him into line, and when 
he comes back, you say, ‘Like, 
man, what happened?’ And so 
he tells you, ‘Well, I couldn’t do 
anything about it.’ That’s just 
what I’m telling you.” 

“I can’t see that,” Shamar 
said. “I just don’t believe that.” 



56 



GALAXY 



\ t another time, Shamar tried 
to explain free elections to a 
female. He was informed, “Man, 
just give me a way to cast a vote 
against all those crumbs — and 
then 111 think twice about all 
this guff you’re peddling.” 

A sober, scholarly man told 
him, “Join the Party? Whatever 
for? You join the Party and 
you’re expected to spend all your 
free evenings at rallies and meet- 
ings and speeches and in cere- 
monial parades in honor of the 
ground breaking for a new auto- 
mated factory. No, thank you.” 
Another told him, “You need 
a lesson in economics, son. What 
do you mean by free society? 
The only way you can run an 
industrial society is to limit pro- 
duction. If you produce enough 
for everybody, the government 
would produce itself out of bus- 
iness. Look here. The Party has 
millions of tabulating machines 
of one kind or another clicking 
happily away day and night ar- 
ranging production to fit in- 
come distribution. They’ve never 
been known to goof and produce 
a surplus of anything. Why, 
damn it, if every man, woman 
and child in the world went out 
to buy a pound of nails apiece, 
the shortage of nails would be 
fantastic. But would they pro- 
duce more nails? You know they 
wouldn’t. ‘So you want more 
nails?’ they’d say. ‘Well, damn 



you, work for them!’ And the 
price would go up. See what I 
mean, son? They’d have another 
stick to beat us with.” 

Later, Shamar found himself 
seated on the floor across from 
an aesthetic in his late thirties. 
“You see, my friend, force and 
violence never accomplish their 
stated ends. We must stand firm- 
ly on the principle of non-vio- 
lence.” 

“But that’s taking it laying 
down,” Shamar protested. 

“No! Sometimes I think it 
goes to the very core of human 
existence. Perhaps this is the 
central import of all philoso- 
phy: the way things are done is 
more important than the ends 
that are obtained.” 

At that point, Ge-Ge arrived 
breathlessly. “Shamar, quickly! 
We must go!” 

“Huh? I’m having this inter- 
esting little talk — ” 

She tugged him from the floor. 
Baffled, he followed her. As he 
did so, the fighting broke out 
in the far corner of the room. 

“Quickly!” she said. “Let’s get 
out of here before the police 
come.” 

They fought their way, hand 
in hand, to the door. There they 
paused for a moment to look 
back. 

“It’s a couple of rival socialist 
parties fighting,” she explained 
breathlessly. 



SHAMAR'S WAR 



57 



“What about?” 

“God knows. Hurry.” 

They were in the street. “Don’t 
run, walk,” she cautioned. After 
a block, she said, “I didn’t even 
need to watch you at the end. 
Everybody got so drunk nobody 
noticed you much.” 

“Even the spies?” 

“Oh, they always get the 
drunkest.” 

The siren sounded. 

“Let’s hurry.” 

When they arrived at Shamar’s 
apartment, she asked, “Well, 
what did you think of the 
party?” 

“It was an education,” he said 
after a moment. 

V 

'T'he following week Shamar 
spent many hours walking the 
streets of Xxla. He tried to con- 
vince himself that the people he 
had met at the party were not 
representative. 

They were. 

Friday night Ge-Ge announce 
“Shamar, I can’t stand much 
more of this! What’s going to 
happen? What is Von Stutsman 
going to do? He’s onto some- 
thing. I sometimes wish — oh, 
God ! — I sometimes wish some- 
thing would happen so we’d 
know where we stand, so we’d 
know what to do!” He tried to 
put an arm around her, but she 



brushed it away. “Don’t! Let me 
alone!” 

She retired to the other side 
of the room. For a moment, and 
for no reason, the hostility in 
the air between them was like 
ice and fire. 

“I’m sorry,” Ge-Ge said curtly. 

“That’s all right,” Shamar 
said, his voice cold and distant. 

“Let’s talk about something 
else.” 

They were silent for a minute. 
Then he said, “I wanted to ask 
you. Of all the people I talked 
to, I couldn’t find anyone who 
seemed to give a damn, one way 
or the other, about Earth. Why 
is that? You’d think they’d be 
at least talking about Earth.” 

“Why should they be? We’ve 
got our own problems.” 

At that point, the police ar- 
rived and took Shamar the 
Worker away. 

nphey put him in a cell in which 
there were already three oth- 
er prisoners. 

“What you in for, buddy?” 

Shamar studied the prisoner 
for a moment without answering. 
His companions looked up. 

“No visible means of sup- 
port,” Shamar said. 

“I’m Long John Freed.” 

Shamar nodded. 

“They’re trying to hook you 
for evading the productivity tax, 
huh?” 



58 



GALAXY 



Shamar declined comment 

Freed settled back on his 
bunk. “I say take them for all 
you can. Now, look, you’re a 
little guy. So they bleed us 
white. Take a factory manager 
or an important Black Market 
operator — you think they pay 
taxes? You can bet they don’t 
It’s a racket. The poor pay and 
pay because they can’t hire fan- 
cy lawyers to lie for them; and 
the rich take and take. I don’t 
see why the Party puts up with 
it.” 

Freed shifted his positioa. 
“Say what you will about the 
Party — and I know it’s got it’s 
faults — still, there are dedicated 
men in it. I may be a small-time 
crook, but I’m as patriotic as the 
next man. The Party’s done a 
lot of good. 

“First time for you? How old 
are you, twenty-seven or so? 
First time, they usually try to 
recruit you for the Factory 
Force. 

“It’s not such a bad racket. 
When you start out, they toss 
you in with lots of kids — usual- 
ly the draftees. You get six weeks 
pick-and-shovel, and you’re real- 
ly dragging when you finish 
that. Then comes specialist 
school. 

“Try to get in as an electrician 
or plumber. Plasterers or brick- 
layers have to work too hard. 
Carpentry’s not bad — I’d hold 




59 



SHAMAR'S WAR 




out for cabinet-making, rather 
than rough carpentry, if I had 
to go into that. Then there’s real 
specialties. Tile laying. You have 
to have a personality for that, 
or you’d go nuts. Demolition’s 
not too bad; you blow up ob- 
solete factories. That would have 
been right down my alley.” 
Freed was silent a moment, 
then he resumed: 

“Sometimes I may talk like a 
radical, and maybe I am a little 
of a radical, I don’t know. You 
look at the overall picture, 
things ain’t too bad. I’ve known 
a lot of thieves and petty crooks 
in my time. As a class, for pure 
patriotism, I’ll stack them up 
against anybody you can name; 
and in a way, you know, I’m 
kind of proud of that. Well, 
let’s shut up and get some shut- 
eye.” 

W h en finally he slept, Shamar 
dreamed that the Party was 
a vast, invulnerable pyramid 
resting on the shifting base of 
the population. It was construct- 
ed to dampen out vibrations. 
The bottom quivered, and the 
quiver ran upward a few inches 
and was absorbed. The top of 
the pyramid remained stable, 
fixed and motionless, indiffer- 
rent even to its own foundation. 
The pyramid was built like an 
earthquake-proof tower. It was 
built to last. The Party was built 



to govern. It need only devote 
itself to its own preservation. 
Any other issue was secondary. 

It was an organic machine. 
The gears were flesh and blood. 
The people on top were main- 
tenance engineers. Their job was 
to go around with an oil can 
that they could squirt when nec- 
essary to keep friction to a min- 
imum. 

He awakened the following 
morning ravenously hungry and 
was hugely disappointed by 
breakfast. Even discounting his 
somewhat biased viewpoint, the 
food was inedible. 

Freed accepted Shamar’s share 
eagerly with the comment, “It’ll 
taste better after you miss a few 
meals. It always does.” 

An hour later, the jailer came 
to open the cell. 

“Shamar the Worker? Get 
your stuff. We’re going.” 

Ge-Ge was waiting in the re- 
ception room. Her hair had been 
especially waved for the occa- 
sion. She wore a suit newly 
pressed and gleaming. She had 
tears in her eyes. 

She fled to his arms. “Dar- 
ling!” she cried, caressing his 
face with childlike wonder. “Was 
it awful? Did they beat you?” 

“I’m fine.” 

“Darling, we’re going to get 
you out on bail. I’ve made all 
the arrangements. We just have 
to go to the Judge’s chambers 



60 



GALAXY 



for a minute, and they’ll let you 
go. Thank God you’re going to 
be out of this horrible place, at 
least for a little while.” 

The jailer brought Shamar’s 
belt and his bag of possessions. 
Shamar signed a receipt for 
them and they went to the 
Judge. 

The Judge said, “Please be 
seated.” He had a resonant 
and friendly voice. He went to 
his desk and sat down. 

Ge-Ge and Shamar seated 
themselves before him. 

“Ah, you young people,” he 
said. “Now, you must be Shamar 
the Worker, and you — ” 
“Garfling Germadpoldlt.” 

“Of course.” He turned to 
Shamar. “I hate to see a fine 
young person like you in trouble, 
Shamar. It seems to me such a 
waste. Man and boy, for sixty 
years I’ve been a dedicated work- 
er for the Party. Oh, Shamar, 
when I think of that glorious 
paradise to come — that time of 
wealth and plenty for all — that 
time when the riches and abun- 
dance of Mother Itra will, from 
Automation, overflow alike the 
homes of the rich and poor. 
They waited. 

He continued. “Here I sit, 
year after year, Garfling and 
Shamar, judging my fellow men. 
Judging poor creatures who do 
not live the Dream. I sometimes 
feel that this is not the way. I 



sometimes feel my job is out 
there on the street comers, 
preaching the Dream, awaken- 
ing the souls, telling the story of 
love and beauty and abundance 
in the life to come. 

“Ah, me. But the world is not 
yet perfect, is it? And man’s un- 
derstanding is imperfect. Here 
you are before me today, Sha- 
mar, with no visible means of 
support and no record of hav- 
ing paid productivity taxes. Oh, 
what a grim and fearful picture! 
In all your life have you ever 
once thought of your obligation 
to the future? You have failed 
yourself; you have failed the 
Party; and failed the future. 

“Yet — in a larger sense — al- 
though this in no way militates 
against your own guilt — have 
we not failed you? How have 
we permitted a human soul to 
degrade himself to the point 
where we must punish him?” 

Abruptly, the Judge stood up. 
“Well, I’ve done the best I can. 
I remand you to the custody of 
Miss Germadpoldlt. Your trial 
will be set at a later date. You 
are not to leave Xxla without 
permission of this court. And I 
hope my lecture today has fallen 
on fertile soil. It is not too late 
to correct your ways. And I may 
say, if I am the one who hears 
your case, your conduct between 
now and the trial may have some 
bearing on the outcome.” 



SHAMAR'S WAR

nphey took a taxi back to his 
apartment Ge-Ge trembled 
violently most of the way and 
nestled against him; they mur- 
mured their affection. 

After he had been fed, she 
said nervously, “It was Von 
Stutsman who was responsible 
for your arrest. I should have 
known we couldn’t fight the 
Party. If he digs hard enough, 
nothing on Itra can save us.” 
Finally, she went out to canvas 
lawyers. 

She came back at dusk. 
“Shamar, darling,” she said, 
“I’ve located him. I asked a lot 
of my friends, and he’s the best. 
He’s a big lawyer for left-wing 
people. I talked to him, I told 
him everything.” 

“What! You told him every- 
thing?” 

“Why, yes.” 

“You, you told him I was an 
Earthman?” He grabbed her by 
the shoulders. “Listen, Ge-Ge! I 
was arrested on a charge I could 
beat; now look what you’ve 
done. What makes you think he 
won’t turn me over to the Party? 
This is too big, now! This isn’t 
just a tax avoidance matter, this 
is treason for him.” 

“It’s all right, darling,” she 
said soothingly, breaking free 
from him. “I had to tell him so 
he’d take the case. Why would 
a big man like Ijim want to de- 
fend a common vagrant?” 



Shamar closed his mouth. “But 
— you mean, he won’t tell any- 
one?” 

“Of course not.” 

“Has the man no patriotism?” 
“Look, Shamar,” she said in 
exasperation, “you once asked 
me why the people in the street 
aren’t upset about Earth. I’m be- 
ginning to see the way you think. 
What you mean is, aren’t we 
afraid of Earth? Aren’t we 
afraid Earth would, oh, do some- 
thing like invade us or some- 
thing? That’s what you mean.” 
“Of course it is.” 

“Once upon a time,” she said, 
“when we first got space flight, 
the Party got all shook up about 
the possibility of some hostile 
force out there developing an in- 
terstellar drive and coming along 
and doing their will with us. 
They asked the computers about 
it. Invading and conquering a 
planet is such a vast technologi- 
cal undertaking that the mind 
just boggles at it. Don’t forget, 
we’ve got a warning network out 
there. They’re not very alert, or 
you wouldn’t have gotten 
through, but they wouldn’t miss 
an invasion fleet. There’s com- 
puter-controlled chemical rock- 
ets in orbit, and we’ve got a few 
sited on Itra that can blast down 
anything that slows up to try to 
land. It wouldn’t take one-hun- 
dredth, it wouldn’t take one- 
thousandth of the technological 



62 



GALAXY 



resources required to defend Itra 
that it would to attack her. Earth 
just simply can’t afford to attack 
us. They’d go broke trying. Every 
million dollars you spent to get 
here, we’d spend a thousand to 
keep you from landing. 

“Oh, I suppose if Earth want- 
ed to, they might figure out some 
way to blow up Itra. But where’s 
the profit in that? We’re not 
bothering you. Why spend all 
that money when it’s not going 
to get you one damn thing in 
return?” 

' I 'he following day, Shamar 
called on the lawyer, Counsel- 
or Freemason. 

Counselor Freemason inquired 
politely as to the state of his 
financial reserves. Shamar re- 
plied reassuringly. 

“Good, good. That’s most en- 
couraging. Most encouraging in- 
deed. We need not place any 
limit on our ingenuity, then. 

“I’ve been thinking about your 
case, Mr. Worker. The thing first 
to do, in my opinion, is to stir 
up public sympathy in your fa- 
vor. It’s almost an ideal case. It 
has no real political overtones. 
It’s not as if you’re accused of 
anything serious. Well, I believe 
I can interest some friends of 
mine who are always deeply 
concerned with cases involving 
the infringement of an individ- 
ual’s liberty — provided, of 



course, there are no political 
overtones. I can think of several 
good people who would be will- 
ing to head up a Defense Com- 
mittee. The fact that we have 
and I’m talking now about as 
much as, oh, one hundred thou- 
sand dollars?” He paused inter- 
rogatively. 

“I’m prepared to pay,” Sha- 
mar said. 

“Maybe even more,” Council- 
man Freemason continued quick- 
ly. “We can come to that later. 
The important thing right now 
is to get down to work on your 
case.” 

“Counselor Freemason, now, 
obviously I’m not a lawyer,” 
Shamar said, “and I know it’s 
bad business to tell a profession- 
al how to run his job. But I be- 
lieve Miss Germadpoldlt ex- 
plained the, ah, rather unusual 
delicacy of my own position. It 
would seem to me that the less 
publicity we got, the better.” 

Counselor Freemason shook a 
pen at him. “A very good point, 
Mr. Worker. It shows you’re 
thinking, and I’m glad of the 
opportunity to explain the rea- 
sons for this recommendation. If 
I brazenly parade you before 
them, you see, by implication it 
means we’re not afraid of your 
background being examined. We 
have nothing to hide. Conse- 
quently, they will not look for 
anything. If, on the other hand, 



SHAMAR'S WAR 



<S3 



I’m cautious, fearful, defensive, 
they’ll ask themselves, ‘What’s 
Counselor Freemason trying to 
hide?’ And they’ll start digging 
into your past. 

“Now, I hope that clears that 
matter up to your satisfaction? 
Good. Good. I’ll get right to 
work on your case. Do you have 
anything else? Miss Germad- 
poldt explained rather nicely, 
I think, yesterday. As far as any- 
one knows, you’re a man with- 
out papers. You’ve never paid 
any taxes but they have no proof 
you owe taxes. You won money 
in the lottery. You collected 
anonymously; lots of people do 
for perfectly valid reasons. Let 
them prove you didn’t win. The 
Party can’t be very interested in 
a man like that. 

“So, I’ll raise an issue. Maybe 
we’ll suggest that any lottery 
winner is likely to be persecuted. 
The Party wants things to go 
smoothly. The lottery makes the 
people feel as if, you know, they 
actually own a piece of things. 
And too many people don’t have 
papers. 

“My job is to take the specific 
and convert it to a vague general 
principle that a number of peo- 
ple feel deeply about. The Party 
will take the easy way out: 
they’re not dumb. They’ve learn- 
ed from experience. You’re not 
worth that much trouble to them. 
Otherwise, there’ll be a period 



of aggravation, people without 
papers beating up police and 
things like that.” 

nphree days later, Shamar met 
with the newly formed Com- 
mittee of One Hundred for Jus- 
tice to Shamar the Worker. 

There were five members of 
the Committee and Counselor 
Freemason in attendance. They 
briefed him on their initial ac- 
tivities. 

They had printed letterheads 
and were circulating letters to 
people known to be friendly, 
with a hastily printed booklet 
giving the facts of the case. 

“As you can see,” Counselor 
Freemason said, “we’re off to a 
very fast start. Um, the question 
naturally arises as to finances. I 
have advanced a certain amount 
out of my own pocket. We will 
need more than I can conven- 
iently scrape together at the 
moment, and I’m reluctant to — 
ah — impose on the Committee 
for a loan insofar as — ” 

“I took the liberty of bringing 
along some cash,” Shamar said. 
“For current expenses and, of 
course, your retainer.” 

They looked relieved. “Excel- 
lent, excellent. I might suggest, 
Mr. Worker, that we appoint one 
of the Committee as treasurer — 
perhaps Mrs. Freetle, here — ” 
the lady smiled — ”to take these 
financial worries off your mind. 



64 



GALAXY 



This will leave you free to de- 
vote yourself fully to activities 
defense.” 

“Now that that’s out of the 
way,” one of the male Commit- 
tee members said, “let’s get right 
down to business. As you can see, 
we’re moving fast. Our overall 
strategy is this. We must first 
establish a public image for 
you, Mr. Worker, an image the 
average man can identify with. 
Counselor Freemason has de- 
scribed your case to us. I simply 
don’t know what the Party’s com- 
ing to to permit a man like Von 
Stutsman to persecute you this 
way. Oh, I tell you, it makes my 
blood boil, Mr. Worker!” 

Others of the Committee 
chimed in and the sentiment 
passed heatedly among them. 

“Well,” said Counselor Free- 
mason, “I guess that about winds 
it up for the moment. You all 
know where to reach me. Any 
time, day or night. I guess, Mr. 
Worker, if you’ll just turn the 
money over to Mrs. Freetle. And 
I think, Mr. Hall, if you’d hire 
that speech writer — what’s his 
name? McGoglhy? — to work 
with Mr. Worker on his 
speeches.” 

“Speeches?” Shamar asked. 

“You’re going to be our fea- 
tured speaker at all the rallies, 
of course,” Mrs. Freetle said. “I 
know you will do splendidly, 
just splendidly! Your accent is 



so captivating. I’ve never heard 
anything quite like it.” 

VI 

✓~\n the evening of his first pub- 
lie appearance, Shamar was 
given a neatly typed speech. 
He rehearsed it hurriedly, stam- 
mers and all. 

“Fellow citizens! As I stand 
here, looking over this sea of 
faces, hearing your applause and 
seeing how your hearts go out to 
one poor man in distress, it — I 
— Well, I’m deeply touched. I 
can’t tell you how much it means 
to me. I prepared a speech for 
tonight, but I’m not going to use 
it. I’m just going to stand here, 
instead, and tell you, just as the 
words come out, how I feel.” 
Here he would pause for ap- 
plause and then continue. 
“Thank you so very much. 
Thank you. I know you’re all 
behind me — except for the po- 
lice agents in the audience.” 
Here he would wait for laughter. 
“We all know them, don’t we? 
I see about a dozen. A dozen 
agents have come down here to 
find out what I’m going to say. 
Isn’t that ridiculous?” Here 
there would be mixed laughter, 
applause and cries in the affirm- 
ative. “All right! Thank you. I 
hope they get an earful tonight.” 

Later in the speech he would 
demand, “Why are they doing 



SHAMAR'S WAR 



65 



this to me? I want you to tell me 
why. What have I done? What 
am I accused of doing? Well, 
I’ll tell you this — I’m not the 
kind of a man who is going to 
submit meekly to this persecu- 
tion. I’m going to fight back. I’ve 
got a little money left from my 
lottery winnings, and I’ll spend 
every cent of it to fight these 
people doing this thing to me.” 
Here he would pause dramati- 
cally. “I want to leave you with 
this point. It’s not just Shamar 
the Worker that’s involved. 
What am I? A poor, itinerant 
laborer going from town to town. 
I’m nothing, I have never had 
anything, and I guess I never 
will have anything. I’m no rich 
black marketeer or businessman. 
I’m no fat politician. I’m just 
one little man. But it’s not me 
— and this is the point I want 
to leave you with — it’s not Sha- 
mar the Worker. He’s unimpor- 
tant. What is important is that 
if they can do this to me, they 
can do it to you. If they can do 
it to Shamar the Worker today, 
next year one of you will be up 
here on this platform speaking 
just the way I am. So you see, 
this is your fight. It’s not me 
that’s important — it’s the prin- 
ciple that’s important — ” 

The meeting went brilliantly. 
Every time he paused, the audi- 
ence responded just as the 
speech-writer had indicated. It 



was as if they were as well re- 
hearsed as he. 

The next night, another meet- 
ing. And another. And another. 
He slept no more than four 
hours a night when the cam- 
paign was in full swing. He 
spoke dozens of times into the 
bright glare of TV cameras. He 
paraded down a million streets 
in an open-topped car. Faces 
poured in front of his own; on 
and on they came. People with 
tears in their eyes cried, “God 
bless Shamar the Worker!” Once 
the Committee hired a brass 
band. 

So, for two weeks, it went. 

Then the Party threw hirr 
back in jail, in an apparent e:' 
fort to deprive the movement of 
its momentus. 

\ fter three days, during which 
•**-time Shamar was held in- 
communicado, Counselor Free- 
mason obtained permission to 
interview his client. 

“We’re making marvelous 
progress! Ge-Ge is turning into 
a most effective crusader. You 
should hear her when she cries, 
‘Give me back my man!’ This is 
a wonderful development for us. 
It’s having the opposite of the 
intended effect. Von Stutsman 
has over-reached himself this 
time. The Party is going to have 
to back down, and it will cost 
him dearly.” 



66 



GALAXY 



“How’s the finances?” 

“Ge-Ge has given us some ad- 
vances — ” 

“How much have you spent?” 

“Well, to tell you the truth, I 
haven’t been keeping track close- 
ly. Perhaps we’ve run a little 
more than we anticipated. The 
response, you see — ” 

Shamar returned to his cell 
wishing Earth’s printing presses 
had worked a little longer. 

It took nearly two weeks to 
arrange for Ge-Ge to visit him. 
When she arrived, she was near- 
ly on the point of tears. 

“Oh, my darling, how I’ve 
missed you!” 

She brought him up to date 
on the progress of his case. As 
Counselor Freemason had re- 
ported, his imprisonment mere- 
ly increased the vigor of his sup- 
porters. Now they were at their 
highest pitch : a pitch which 

would be difficult to maintain. 

“I’m just worried sick,” she 
said. “If the Party can hold out 
another week or two. I don’t 
want to worry you, Shamar, but 
I want you to know how you 
stand. Counselor Freemason says 
the worst that could happen 
would be a short prison sentence, 
no more than a year, for not 
filing tax forms. We could keep 
you out on appeal for quite a 
while.” 

“Ge-Ge, how much have we 
spent so far?” 



“About three hundred thou- 
sand dollars.” 

“Good God! They’ll have it all 
when they get through! If I ever 
get back to Earth — ” 

“I don’t care about money, 
Shamar! I just want you free!” 
He took her shoulders. “Ge-Ge, 
suppose the Party can’t afford 
to back down? Maybe they feel 
they have to stand firm to pre- 
vent a lot of future trouble. And 
when Freemason gets ail the 
money . then what chance will 
we stand? They might railroad 
me for years. They’ll make an 
example out of me. Now, are you 
willing to gamble? Everybody 
would jump at the chance to 
vote them out. If we could — ” 
“Please, Shamar,” Ge-Ge said. 
“All this voting thing you’ve al- 
ways been so sold on is all right, 
I guess — but it just won’t work. 
To begin with, there isn’t any 
way to vote.” 

“Maybe there is,” he said. 

Chamar was still in jail the fol- 
^ lowing day when Ge-Ge ap- 
peared on the TV program. 

PAMDEN had been reluctant 
to release time to her. PAMDEN 
was Itra’s largest industrial co- 
operative — Plastics, Agricul- 
tural Machinery, Detergents, 
Electricity and Newsprint — 
and, being the most efficient, 
was responsible for operating 
the TV networks. 



SHAMAR'S WAR

“Good heavens,” said the sta- 
tion executive. “Nobody can say 
we haven’t already given you 
coverage, Miss Germadpoldlt.” 

“They’ve ordered you to stop!” 
she protested. 

“They? The Party? Miss Ger- 
madpoldlt, do you honestly be- 
lieve that? Nobody tells a sta- 
tion manager what to program. 
Believe me. There is no prior 
censorship whatsoever. But, on 
the other hand, we can’t turn 
over the TV stations to minority 
propaganda either.” 

Ge-Ge argued and pleaded, 
and in the end the executive 
sighed wearily. “I think we’ve 
been more than fair. But for you 
— and this is a personal favor, 
Miss Germadpoldlt, because you 
are a young and attractive wom- 
an — for you, I will phone our 
program director and see if he 
can get you on the Noon Inter- 
view Show for tomorrow. It 
gives you the Itra-wide network, 
which is certainly more than 
anyone has the right to ask. 
You’ll have ninety seconds to 
make your case. That’s the best 
I can do.” 

“Oh, thank you, thank you,” 
Ge-Ge sobbed. “You’re so fair 
and generous.” Outside his of- 
fice she took a deep breath, 
crossed her fingers and went 
home to revise her speech. She 
had only expected sixty. 

Ge-Ge arrived at the studio 



well in advance and was handed 
over to the makeup department. 
With deft skill they converted 
her youth to age and contrived 
to instill in her face weariness 
and defeat. Her protests were 
ignored. 

“This is the way you make 
up for TV,” she was told. 

They clucked collective 
tongues in disapproval when 
they were finished and sent her 
on her way to a brief chat with 
the M.C. 

The M.C. assured her that she 
looked divine and hastily 
scanned her prepared remarks, 
which had been heavily edited 
by some anonymous hand in the 
news department. The M.C. in- 
corporated a few pointless revi- 
sions and dispatched the mes- 
sage to the department handling 
idiot-board material. It was ex- 
plained that Ge-Ge was to read, 
word for word, from the elec- 
tronic prompter. 

Ge-Ge watched the program 
from the wings. When she heard 
a commercial message in favor 
of the consumption of a parti- 
cular variety of candy, her heart 
ran away with itself. Her cour- 
age faltered. But Shamar’s face 
brought it back. 

The signal came. She walked 
into the terrible glare which 
held up every imperfection to 
microscopic inspection. She 
shook hands, turned, and the 



68 



GALAXY 



camera closed in, full face. Be- 
yond the camera lay the largest 
daytime TV audience on Itra. 
She felt they were examining 
her pores with minute and cri- 
tical attention. 

She blinked nervously and be- 
gan to read. “I am here to tell 
you about Shamar the Worker.” 
That was as far as she went with 
the prepared text. Before the 
horrified ears of the auditors in 
the studio, she plunged into re- 
marks of another kind entirely. 

“If you want to do something 
to help Shamar the Worker, stop 
buying candy! Don’t buy any 
more candy. If you want to help 
Shamar the Worker, don’t buy 
any candy until he’s free. If you 
want to help Shamar, please, 
please, don’t buy — ” 

At this point the technicians 
cut Ge-Ge out and, with pro- 
found mistiming, faded in an 
oleogenous taped message from 
the candy manufacturer which 
began, “Friends, everybody likes 
Red Block candy, and millions 
buy it every day. Here’s why — ” 
Ge-Ge surveyed the surround- 
ing confusion and walked un- 
molested from the studio. 

When she arrived home, an 
angry Counselor Freemason was 
waiting on her doorstep. Inside, 
she allowed the Counselor to 
present his case. 

This new move, he explained, 
would have terrible conse- 



quences. Shamar’s good faith 
would be prejudiced. One sim- 
ply did not, with impunity, go 
outside the law in such matters. 
There were rules you absolutely 
must play the game by. He 
washed his hands of all respon- 
sibility for her conduct. “I hope 
to God nothing comes of it,” he 
concluded. “I’m having the Com- 
mittee prepare a denial of — ” 
The phone rang at this point, 
and without asking permission, 
Counselor Freemason answered 
it. “Yes? This is Counselor Free- 
mason, go ahead.” He listened a 
moment, said, “They did,” in a 
weary voice and cradled the 
phone. 

He turned to Ge-Ge. “Now 
we’re in for it. That was Pete 
Freedle from the Committee.” 
“Well,” said Ge-Ge, “I think 
we’ll just wait a few days and 
see what happens.” 

A week later, Ge-Ge was still 
waiting. Counselor Freemason, 
deprived of finances, was power- 
less to move. He saw everything 
crashing in shambles at their 
feet. 

“But are they selling candy?” 
Ge-Ge asked. 

“That’s beside the point!” 
Counselor Freemason cried. 
“Look here, every crackpot on 
the planet will get into the act. 
They don’t care about Shamar. 
All you’re going to prove now 
is that the Party is unpopular. 



SHAMAR'S WAR 



69 



Everyone already knows that.” 
He struck his forehead in ex- 
asperation. 

TT'or two weeks, all was quiet. 

There were no more rallies 
for Shamar the Worker. Signs 
were torn down and destroyed. 
No bulletins were printed. No 
word passed over the electronic 
communications network. The 
Committee, bankrupt, dissolved 
in mutual recriminations and 
bickering, convinced that the 
cause of civil liberties had been 
set back one hundred years. 

But candy was not selling. 

It clogged the distribution 
channels. It piled up in ware- 
houses. It lay untouched in 
stores. It grew rancid. Mechanic- 
ally the factories continued to 
turn it out. 

The Party denied the boycott 
was having any effect. This did 
not appease the distributors of 
candy and the sellers of candy 
and the producers of candy. 
Their jobs were at stake. They 
had payrolls to meet. 

The Party stopped production 
of candy. People suddenly found 
themselves with no jobs to go to. 

The economic system was so 
tightly controlled and organized 
that the effect was immediate. 
There was too little money avail- 
able to purchase the supplies 
normally purchased. Suppliers 
cut back on their factory orders. 



This further reduced the need 
for supplies. 

At this point, the Party de- 
cided that the people would, by 
heaven, eat candy. The Party 
Leader himself went on TV to 
appeal to the patriotism of the 
people and to order them to re- 
sume buying candy. This was a 
tactical error. But being the 
idea of the Party Leader him- 
self, who had always crashed 
headlong into obstacles, none 
opposed it. 

The issue was directly joined. 
People resented being told that 
it was their patriotic duty to eat 
something that all medical opin- 
ion held was harmful. Further- 
more, people realized that they 
had somehow stumbled on a fatal 
flaw in the system, which they 
could exploit without immediate 
danger. 

They responded by refusing to 
buy soap. 

The people were now in open 
revolt. At last they had a method 
for disapproving of things in 
general. 

The economy plummeted. The 
computers were in a frenzy. Ef- 
fects of corrective actions were 
no longer predictable. The Party 
frantically tried to buy soap and 
dump it. The people turned to 
other commodities. 

Pressure now mounted from 
within the Party itself. The Su- 
pervisor of PAMDEN saw his 



70 



GALAXY 



carefully nurtured empire begin 
to disintegrate. A massive layoff 
in Consumer Plastics (badly hit 
by a running boycott) took with 
it valuable key personnel. The 
Supervisor of PAMDEN told 
the Party Leader himself that he 
damned well better do some- 
thing about the situation, and 
damned soon, too. 

The Party Leader himself or- 
dered the release of Shamar the 
Worker. 

But by then no one was inter- 
ested in Shamar the Worker. 

'T'he man came and unlocked 
Shamar’s cell door. Shamar 
stood up. The guard tossed in 
Shamar’s clothing. “Get dress- 
ed.” Shamar got dressed. “Come 
along.” Shamar came along. 

Shamar had had no word from 
outside for nearly two months, 
and it was not until he saw Ge- 
Ge’s face, radiant with joy, that 
he realized he had won. 

“You’re free!” she cried ex- 
citedly. 

Shamar was given back his 
belt and possessions. As they 
waited for the Judge to make it 
official, Shamar asked, “I won- 
der what will happen now?” 

“Nobody knows. Everybody 
says the Party’s out for sure. In- 
dividual Party members will try 
to form a new government, but 
it’s going to have to be radically 
different. They’ll try to keep all 



they can, but the people will 
wring them dry for every last 
concession. Maybe now when 
they build the factories, they’ll 
stay built and actually produce 
something.” 

“For a little while,” Shamar 
said. 

“Longer than a little while,” 
Ge-Ge said. “We’ve got a way to 
vote now, when things get too 
bad.” 

The Judge, in his red robe, 
came in. They stood respectfully. 
He looked at them for a long 
time and said nothing. Finally, 
he spoke: 

“Well, Shamar the Worker, I 
guess you’ve got what you want. 
You pulled down a whole civili- 
zation. I hope you’re satisfied. 
What Dream will you give us 
to replace the Dream you have 
taken from us?” 

His face hardened. 

“Shamar the Worker,” he said, 
‘the Party Leader himself has 
asked us to dismiss the pending 
charges against you. This I now 
do. You are free to go.” 

“Thank you, sir,” Shamar said 
respectfully. 

“Shamar the Worker, for your 
own sake, you better hope that I 
never see you in my court. You 
better not get yourself arrested 
for anything. I will show you no 
mercy, but justice will be swift 
and summary. So that you may 
not rest easily at night, I am

71 



having some of my very skillful 
and competent friends check 
through your background thor- 
oughly. You should hope, very 
sincerely, that they find noth- 
ing. You may go.” 

Ge-Ge and Shamar stood. The 
turned in silence. When they 
were at the door, the Judge 
called, “Oh, Shamar the Work- 
er!” 

He turned, “Yes, sir?” 
“Shamar the Worker, I do not 
like your accent.” 

Shamar could feel Ge-Ge trem- 
bling uncontrollably at his side. 

But when they reached the 
street, they were greeted by hea- 
lines announcing that a delega- 
tion from the planet Earth had 
arrived. 

VII 

'TPhe Earth delegation had tak- 
*■ en over a suite in the Party 
Hotel, grandest and most expen- 
sive on Itra. Usually it was re- 
served for high Party members: 
Shamar and Ge-Ge presented 
themselves at the desk. Shamar 
wrote out a note in English. 
“Deliver this to the Earthmen,” 
he instructed. 

Shamar and Ge-Ge retired to 
await results. Less than five 
minutes passed; the bell hop re- 
turned. “Sir and Madam,” he 
said respectfully, “come with 
me.” 



When he entered the suite, he 
felt the personality of Shamar 
the Worker drop from him in- 
to memory. 

“Captain Shaeffer! Captain 
Shaeffer! Oh, what a magnifi- 
cant job! I’m Gene Gibson from 
the new Department of Extra- 
Terrestial Affairs. Who’s this?” 
“This is my fiancee.” 

“Good heavens, man, you in- 
tend to marry a native?” The 
man stepped back, shocked. 

Capt. Shaeffer turned to Ge- 
Ge and performed bilingual in- 
troductions. 

They moved from the hallway 
to the sitting room and arranged 
themselves on the furniture. 

“I must say, Captain Shaeffer, 
that your success on Itra has sur- 
passed our wildest expectations. 
The first inkling we had was 
when, out of the blue, as it were, 
there was your face looking out 
at us from the TV screen! You 
should have been there for our 
celebration that night! You’d 
been on Itra just a little over 
two months! You’re going down 
in history as one of the greatest 
heroes of all time!” 

Capt. Shaeffer said, ‘I think 
it would be best if Ge-Ge and I 
were to board your ship immedi- 
ately. Her life may be in dan- 
ger. Some old-line Party men 
might resent her role in the rev- 
olution. Actually, she had more 
to do with it than I did.” 



72 



GALAXY 



“Oh, now, I’m sure you must 
be exaggerating a bit on that, 
Captain Shaeffer. Her life in 
danger? Surely, now! Speaking 
frankly, Captain — and mind 
you, I have no personal objec- 
tion at all; this is none of my 
business. But she is, after all, an 
Itraian. You know these mixed 
marriages — ” 

“I don’t give a damn what you 
personally think,” Capt. Shaef- 
fer said. “Is that understood 
once and for all? She goes.” 
“Of course. I was just — now 
don’t get huffy. Of course she 
goes. Just as you wish, Captain.” 
The angry exchange over an 
unknown but fearfully expected 
issue caused Ge-Ge to blink back 
tears. 

\ week later, Gene Gibson 
came for the first time to visit 
them. Capt. Shaeffer inquired 
as to progress. 

“Well, Captain, things are pro- 
gressing. We are establishing a 
government which will be more 
responsive to the will of the 
people of Itra. We’ve had sev- 
eral very pleasant, informal 
chats with the Party Leader, 
himself. Really a wonderful 
man. Once he got all the facts — 
which were kept from him the 
first time we landed — he strikes 
me as being quite responsible. I 
think we may have misjudged 
him. I’m not too sure but what 



he isn’t just the exact man to 
head up the new government. 
We’ve discussed a few details on 
trade agreements and, I must say, 
he’s been very reasonable.” 

Capt. Shaeffer said nothing. 

“Yes,” Gene Gibson said, “he’s 
really an exceptional individ- 
ual. A wealth of administrative 
experience. A fine grasp of prac- 
tical politics. I don’t regard him 
as a typical Itraian at all. He 
feels that, with us backing him, 
we can get this whole mess 
straightened out in a few 
months.” 

“Mess?” 

“Well, you must admit, I 
think, Captain Shaeffer, that 
you did — well — make negotia- 
tions extremely difficult, in view 
of the, ah, present temper of the 
populace. 

“You see, Earth would like to 
have a stable and responsible 
government. A government, that 
is, which can see larger issues 
in perspective. Not one which 
must devote its full time to cop- 
ing with a group of unpatriotic 
anarchists running loose in the 
streets.” 

“What’s he saying?” Ge-Ge 
asked. 

“As it is now,” Gene Gibson 
continued, “we do have several 
rather difficult problems. I 
think we’ll probably have to 
quarantine Itra for a few months 
until the Party Leader himself 



SHAMAR'S WAR 



73 



can form a stable organizational 
structure. Somehow news of our 
trade discussions have leaked out 
and for some reason has resulted 
in a general work stoppage. So 
you see? By God, I’ll just come 
right out and say it: Shaeffer, 
you’ve left us one hell of a mess!” 

With that, Gene Gibson de- 
parted. 

“What did he say?” Ge-Ge 
asked meekly. But Shaeffer only 
shook his head. 

The following day, the ship’s 
captain came to pay a courtesy 
call. 

“A very neat piece of work, 
Merle. Your new assignment just 
came in, by the way, on the space 
radio.” 

“New assignment? Ge-Ge and 
I are on our way back to Earth.” 

“No. you’re not. We’re to drop 
you off at Midway for tranship- 
ment to Folger’s Hill. It’s a new 
planet. You’re to be Earth rep- 
resentative to the people of Fol- 
ger's Hill. The first shipload of 
colonists arrived about a month 
ago.” 

“I see,” Capt. Shaeffer said. 

“The salary’s good,” the ship’s 
captain said. 

“Suppose I don’t want to go?" 

“I’ve got orders to leave you 
at Midway. I’d want to go if I 
were you. They want you out of 
the way for a little while. You 
can’t fight it. You’ve been ap- 
pointed a General in the De- 

74 



fense Forces, so you’re now un- 
der military law — and it’s an 
order.” 

At this point, Ge-Ge broke in 
to say, “How are things going in 
Xxla?” 

General Shaeffer choked back 
his anger and presented the ques- 
tion. 

“They don’t tell us anything. 
The crew is confined to the 
ship.” 

Shamar the Worker turned to 
Ge-Ge. “It’s going about the 
same,” he said. 

A year later. General Merle S. 

Shaeffer’s card popped out of 
the computer. 

“General Shaeffer’s up for re- 
assignment.” 

“Who in hell is General Shaef- 
fer?” 

“Never heard of him.” 

The card passed upward. 

“Merle Shaeffer is due for re- 
assignment,” a man who knew 
the name told the Secretary of 
the Over Council at lunch the 
following day. “There’s a new 
planet opened up even further 
away than Folger’s Hill.” 

“He’s the one who butchered 
the Itra assignment? Send him 
there. Anything new from Itra 
recently, by the way?” 

“Same as usual. I understand 
the anarchists have formed some 
kind of government.” 

“Terrible. Terrible. Well, the 

GALAXY 



less said about that the better.” 
A week later, again over lunch, 
the Secretary was told: 

“I guess we needn’t worry 
about Merle Shaeffer any more. 
Disappeared from his post, he 
and that Itraian woman of his, a 
couple of weeks after they ar- 
rived on Folger’s Hill. Probably 
a hunting accident got them 
both. Their bodies were never 
found. These things happen on 
wild new planets.” 

The Secretary was silent for a 
long time. Then he said: “Shaef- 
fer dead, eh? I guess it’s better 
that way. Well, a genius has 
passed, and we’ll not see his like 
again. Perverted, perhaps, but a 
genius none the less.” 

They drank solemnly. 

“To Merle Shaeffer. You could 
call him a hero, so let’s you and 
I drink to that. No one else ever 
will.” ■ 

They drank again. 

Nothing further served to stir 
the Secretary’s memory of Merle 
Shaeffer, and he retired six 
months later at the end of his 
term. The new Secretary was not 
familiar with the Itraian affair. 

He had been in office just a 
few days less than a year when, 
one morning, he arrived at his 
office in a furious rage. “Get me 



the Head of the Defense Forces!” 
“I’m sorry, sir, all the phones 
are tied up,” his secretary said. 

“What in hell do you mean, 
all the phones are tied up?” 

“I don’t know. Maybe all at 
once everybody just left their 
phones off the hook or some- 
thing.” 

“Why would they do that? 
That’s ridiculous! Get a runner 
over after him.” 

Half an hour later, the Head 
of the Defense Forces arrived. 

“Do you know,” the new Secre- 
tary demanded, “that yesterday 
all the pennies went out of cir- 
culation? People apparently 
have been saving them for the 
last couple of months. It finally 
showed up. All at once, there 
aren’t any pennies. You can’t 
make change. Damn it, why 
would those crazy idiots all de- 
cide to save their pennies at the 
same time? It’s not rational. 
Why did they do it?” 

The Head of the Defense 
Forces said nothing. 

The Secretary raved at him 
in anger, but the Head of the 
Defense Forces did not have the 
heart to tell him that a hero had 
returned home.

up with the interesting figure of 
5280 feet to a mile. 

It may be equally traditional 
to say that one shilling contains 
twelve pence and that twenty 
shillings make one pound. At 
least one historian holds that 
this relationship represents an 
original relationship of values, 
namely that one pound of gold 
was worth twenty pounds of sil- 
ver while each pound of silver 
bought twelve pounds of copper. 

While these things may be tra- 
ditional they are also quite im- 
practical. Every individual has 
had to memorize them at one 
time in his or her life. On the 
other hand, it needs no time at 
all to “memorize” that there are 
100 cents in the dollar, or that 
1000 millimeters make one me- 
ter, and 1000 meters make one 
kilometer. Since most of the 
household and workshop arith- 



metic can be carried out in one’s 
head when using the metric sys- 
tem, but needs paper and pen- 
cil when carried out in the inch- 
foot system, the statement that 
the metric system will win out 
eventually does not even deserve 
the label “prediction”. 

But how did it start and why? 

nphe “why” begins with the fact 
that in, say, 1700 there was 
no system at all. 

If this statement makes you 
think that each country had its 
own “pound”, and “foot” and 
“mile” you are only partly right. 
In actual fact, it was not each 
country, but each province; and 
sometimes the northern part of 
a province used one set of meas- 
urements while the southern 
part of the province used anoth- 
er one. And the cities, being 
rich, were much too proud to 
use the rural measurements of 
the surrounding countryside, so 
they had their own. 

The country that was best off 
in this chaos was England. There 
one system was used throughout 
by royal decree. But in France 
there was no such uniformity; 
in the northern part of the coun- 
try alone the pound had twenty- 
one different values, depending 
on where you happened to be. 
As for measures for grain, not 
less than three hundred different 
kinds have been compiled by pa-

tient historians. Their relation- 
ships were sometimes simple, as 
when a city council might de- 
cree that the city unit for grain 
was three of the units of the sur- 
rounding countryside. 

But sometimes the relation- 
ships were anything but simple. 
In fact they were sometimes so 
complicated that a mathemati- 
cian had to be called in, as was 
the case in 1626 when the coun- 
cil of the City of Ulm called on 
the great Johannes Kepler to 
straighten out their measure- 
ments. The merchants could nev- 
er agree on the length of a 
“shoe” and the question of how 
much grain constituted a “buck- 
et” often had the result that the 
suppliers and customers flung 
actual buckets at each other. 
Kepler accepted the job for two 
reasons. One was that the math- 
ematical aspects of the problem 
intrigued him. The other was 
that the city paid him. 

The final outcome was the 
“Kettle of Ulm”, a metal con- 
tainer which combined all the 
customary measurements. They 
were listed on the outside of the 
kettle in raised letters, even 
rhyming. The inside diameter of 
the kettle was one ell. its depth 
was two shoes, its capacity “one 
honest bucket”. The weight of 
the kettle, when empty, was 4 V 2 
units; when full of water it was 
7 units. And now we come to the 



problem of the grain measure: 
if you filled the kettle 64 times 
with grain you had 90 measures! 

If one reads that in those days 
money changers and mer ants 
coped with the endless varieties 
of silver and of gold coins by 
just weighing them it looks at 
first glance as if at least the 
money changers had found a use- 
ful shortcut, based on the fact 
that a pound of silver is a pound 
of silver, and a pound of gold is 
a pound of gold. Well, yes. But 
which pound? The pound of 
London, or that of Strasbourg 
(which was less), or that of 
Hamburg (which the English 
then called Hamborough and 
which was .95 of the London 
pound), or that of Leipzig, 
which was 1.15 of the London 
pound? 

No wonder that, in 1704, the 
Englishman John Harris com- 
piled a book called Lexicon 
T echnicum which contained 
endless tables of how the pound 
of Calcutta, Rotterdam, etc. com- 
pared with that of England; 
other long tables compared the 
foot of the various countries. 
Glancing over these tables now, 
one sees with a good deal of as- 
tonishment that the “Spanish 
foot” was the same as the Eng- 
lish, but the “Toledo foot” was 
shorter (see Table) while, on the 
other hand, the Toledo pound 
was the same as the English. 



78 



GALAXY 



(There seems to have been no 
“Spanish pound.”) 

But the internal confusion was 
greatest in France. Many French- 
men felt that, if the king of Eng- 
land could decree uniform meas- 
urements throughout his realm, 
the king of France should do 
the same. The French, at the 
time, had a system of making 
complaints and suggestions. The 
documents bore the name of 
Cahiers de doleance s (writs of 
grievances) and they seem to 
have contained complaints about 
the lack of uniform measure- 
ments almost every year. The 
earliest known was in a cahier 
of 1576. By about 1785, the gov- 
ernment in Paris decided that a 
reform should be considered. 
Reading about a two-century in- 
terval one is reminded of the 
famous lines — 

the government, 
the truth to tell, 
did nothing in particular, 
but did it very well! 

But it was not just a case of 
indifference and procrastina- 
tion. To say that things are con- 
fused and that a reform is needed 
is one thing. Making useful sug- 
gestions for a reform is some- 
thing else. The French govern- 
ment — ultimately the king — 
seems to have felt that the sug- 
gestions were incomplete in 



themselves. At any event that 
they were not definite enough 
to base decrees and laws on them. 

r I 'he English had taken their 
•*- measurements from the hu- 
man body. The “foot” was an 
actual foot; that is, it was the 
average of the foot lengths of a 
dozen grown men, picked at 
random (or so the story goes). 
Now it so happened that 36 bar- 
leycorns “from the center of an 
ear” made one foot; therefore 
the “barleycorn” became the sub- 
division of an inch, with three 
barleycorn to the inch. Later on 
most artisans decided that halv- 
ing and quartering the inch was 
easier, so only bootmakers con- 
tinued to use the barleycorn as 
the smaller unit — a practice 
still continued by shoe manufac- 
turers in England and in the 
United States. A difference of 
one size means a difference of 
one barleycorn, or one third of 
an inch, in length. It also hap- 
pened that a piece of rope 
stretched from fingertip to fin- 
gertip across the chest of a man 
(a “fathom”) was very closely 
six feet, and one half of that 
became a yard. 

The official English measure- 
ments, then, were based on the 
human body, and the measures 
of other areas and cities prob- 
ably were too. But the French 
scientists did not wish to follow 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



79 



this pattern. The dimensions of 
the human body were too vari- 
able. Basing a set of official 
measures on the size of the plan- 
et Earth was more to their lik- 
ing, since the size of the planet 
would not change. That was, of 
course, true enough ; the prob- 
lem was that the size of the plan- 
et was not accurately known. 

It is not surprising that the 
first man to propose using the 
planet Earth as a standard was 
an astronomer. He was Jacques 
Cassini, and for that reason of- 
ten called Cassini the Second. 
He suggested in 1720 that the 
standard foot should be the hun- 
dredth part of one second of arc 
of a meridian. The French Acad- 
emy thought this a fine and logi- 
cal suggestion, which only had 
the one drawback that the vari- 
ous attempts to measure the 
length of a meridian showed 
rather poor agreement. About 
thirty years later another French 
scientist, the mathematician and 
astronomer Charles-Marie de la 
Condamine, came with another 
suggestion which would be easier 
to carry out in practice. 

Galileo Galilei had been the 
first to notice that the time re- 
quired for a pendulum to com- 
plete one swing depended on the 
length of the pendulum. In real- 
ity the time required depends 
on two factors, namely the length 
of the pendulum and the lati- 



tude, but Galileo did not know 
that. It was suspected by the 
astronomer Jean Picard that lati- 
tude might be a factor involved. 
But Picard made the general 
suggestion that a pendulum of a 
length resulting in a period of 
one second would be a useful 
basis for linear measurements. 

The length of the seconds 
pendulum, it may be mentioned 
at this point, is 39.01 inches, or 
99.09 centimeters; this is the 
standard figure, which requires 
a correction for the latitude. 

To get away from the need for 
corrections, de la Condamine 
suggested the length of the sec- 
onds pendulum at the equator 
as the unit for linear measure- 
ment. 

So these were the two sugges- 
tions, either a fraction of the 
length of the meridian, or else 
the length of the seconds pendu- 
lum. But both still had to be 
determined. 

\ long with the problem of find- 
ing a standard length which 
would not vary — and which 
could be re-established in case 
a catastrophe of some kind de- 
stroyed the first standard — 
there was the problem of sub- 
division of the standard. Think- 
ing in dozens was customary; as 
we have seen the foot was di- 
vided into a dozen inches or in- 
to three dozen barleycorns. But 



80 



GALAXY 



the dozen was not the only sub- 
unit or super-unit in use. In 
some places the foot was divided 
into eighths, and in Germany 
things like eggs or hard rolls 
were sold not by the dozen, but 
by the Mandel which was 15 
units. To make things worse the 
Germans had the “peasant’s man- 
del” in addition; it consisted of 
16 units. (Remember the “bak- 
er’s dozen”.) 

A dozen may be superior to 
ten because it can be divided by 
2, 3, 4 and 6, while ten can only 
be divided by 2 and 5, but it so 
happens that we have ten fin- 
gers. A division into ten sub- 
units is therefore easier to visu- 
alize, at least for the beginner. 
The man who was the first to 
advocate subdivision into tenths 
was the Dutch mathematician 
Simon Stevin, military engineer 
to Count Maurits of Nassau. 
Stevin was not concerned with 
the measurements themselves or 
their origin and accuracy; he 
just advocated subdivision into 
decimal fractions. In order to 
find a larger audience he wrote 
his book twice, once in Latin 
and once in French. Both ver- 
sions were printed in Leyden in 
1585. The title of the French ver- 
sion was La Disme, and the Eng- 
lish translation by Robert Nor- 
ton (published in 1608) was 
called Disme: The Art of Tenths, 
or, Decimall Arithmeticke. 



The word disme means “tenth” 
and is related to “tithe”. At one 
time it was the name of an Amer- 
ican coin, the Half Dismes and 
Dismes between 1792 and 1800, 
later spelled “dimes”. 

Apparently Simon Stevin’s 
book in its various editions con- 
vinced everyone — with the ex- 
ception of the Master of the 
Royal Mint — of the superiority 
of decimal fractions, for the 
French Academy decided from 
the outset that this is what they 
would use in carrying out the 
mandate from the National As- 
sembly to create a new system 
of weights and measures. The 
National Assembly had recom- 
mended the length of the sec- 
onds pendulum as a suitable 
(and repeatable) physical con- 
stant, but it had not said any- 
thing about decimal fractions. 

But while the Academy de- 
cided on decimal fractions it al- 
so decided that the meridian 
would be superior to the seconds 
pendulum as a standard. It rec- 
ommended in 1791 that the ten 
millionth part of the distance 
from the pole to the equator 
should be the new unit of meas- 
urement, the meter. The Nation- 
al Assembly accepted the recom- 
mendation. And then the hard 
work of measuring began. 

In the meantime the savants 
had to fight with words. The unit 
was to be the meter (in French

metre') and a tenth of a meter 
was a decimeter. A tenth of a 
decimeter, or a hundredth of a 
meter, was obviously a centi- 
meter. The tenth part of a centi- 
meter was a millimeter — the 
word means a thousandth of a 
meter. 

Going the other way, a term 
meaning a thousand meters was 
needed. The Greek word chilioi 
suggested itself, in spite of two 
drawbacks. In Greek letters the 
“ch” was the letter chi, which 
looks like an x. But the letter 
c hi, considered as a numeral, 
meant 600. However, the Greeks 
themselves had often used the 
chi to mean 1000, as an abbrevi- 
ation of the word chilioi. 

One thing somewhat disturb- 
ing to Frenchmen was that all 
classical scholars were agreed 
that the chi was a guttural and 
Frenchmen, for no better reason 
that they cannot pronounce 
them easily, are opposed to gut- 
turals. But somebody saved the 
day by discovering that the Ion- 
ian dialect of Greek used a kappa 
instead of the chi — the Ionians 
apparently were opposed to gut- 
turals too — and the name of 
the unit of 1000 meters became 
the kilometer. 

VTow the unit of linear meas- 

^ ure was to be the ten mil- 
lionth part of the distance from 
a pole to the equator. This could 



be determined without much dif- 
ficulty from the figure provided 
by Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille, 
who derived the length of one 
degree of the meridian under 
45 latitude as 57,027 toises, 
each toise being six feet Parisian. 
(Take it from there ... if you 
have absolutely nothing else to 
do.) But the new system also was 
to include weights, and the unit 
of weight was to be the weight 
of a unit volume of distilled wa- 
ter weighed in a vacuum cham- 
ber at the temperature of melt- 
ing ice. The name chosen for this 
unit was gravet. 

Later on the unit volume was 
chosen as one cubic centimeter, 
and the temperature was shifted 
from that of melting ice to 4 de- 
grees centigrade because at that 
temperature water shows its 
greatest density. Finally the 
name of this unit weight became 
gram, with kilogram for a thou- 
sand of these units and ton 
(metric ton) for a thousand kilo- 
grams. 

Everything would have been 
fine if France had not become 
a republic in the meantime. Now 
the work of establishing the new 
system was under a new commis- 
sion. Of course it had the name 
of Commission temporaire des 
Poids & Mesures republicans, 
the Temporary Commission for 
Republican Weights and Meas- 
ures. The system that had been 



82 



GALAXY 



meant foe everybody in all coun- 
tries had now become the “Sys- 
tem of the Republic”, just as 
they concocted a “Calendar of 
the Republic” which was finally 
abandoned by Napoleon to the 
jubilation of everybody. Wheth- 
er the French revolutionaries ac- 
tually intended the new system 
to be for France only is not quite 
clear, but the title page of the 
official book introducing the sys- 
tem sounded as if this were the 
case. 

The title page read (the sign/ 
indicates that a new line began 
on the page) : Instruction/sur 

/Les Mesures/deduites/de la 
Grandeur de la Terrejuni- 
formes/Pour Toute la Repub- 
lique/et/sur les calculs relatifs 
/a leur division decimale. In 
English : Instructions on the 

Measurements derived from the 
size of the earth, uniform for the 
whole republic, with tables in 
decimal fractions. 

With such a title page, he 
King of England, the King of 
Prussia, the Czar of all the Rus- 
sians and every other king or 
prince could not only suspect 
that this might not be suitable 
for his country, he almost had to 
come to the conclusion that it 
should be forbidden in his coun- 
try. As a matter of fact, because 
of these (purely accidental) po- 
litical implications the new sys- 
tem made headway very slowly. 



It made headway slowly in 
France too. The system became 
legal in December 1799 and the 
First Consul of the Republic Na- 
poleon Bonaparte made it com- 
pulsory in 1801. But in 1837, sev- 
eral governments later, a law 
had to be passed imposing fines 
on recalcitrant silk and wine 
merchants (among others) who 
did not use the metric system ex- 
clusively beginning January 1, 
1840. 

By now the metric system is 
all but universal. The Russians 
adopted it in 1918, and in the 
two countries which are still 
holding out, the British Com- 
monwealth and the United States, 
it is at least legal. In the United 
States, as a matter of fact, the 
yard and pound, etc., are defined 
in terms of the metric system, 
so that a housewife buying two 
yards of fabric is actually buy- 
ing according to the metric sys- 
tem, though she is not likely to 
know the fact unless her hus- 
band happens to be a lawyer or 
a scientist. 

What opposition to the metric 
system remains is usually based 
on invested capital. A factory 
will say that it has X million 
dollars invested in non-metric 
machinery, and even though 
these machines could be convert- 
ed it would not do any good, 
because the raw material, bar 
stock, etc., comes in non-metric 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



83 



dimensions from the rolling 
mill. And the rolling mill says, 
of course, that they have X mil- 
lion dollars invested in their 
machinery. 

It is an opposition which will 
slowly dwindle away. But as far 
as argumentation is concerned it 
is certainly superior to that of a 
now forgotten society which ex- 
isted in 1879 (and for a few years 
after) in Boston. 

The background for this socie- 
ty had been the attempt of 
Charles Piazzi Smyth, Astrono- 
mer Royal for Scotland, to find 
all kinds of “cosmic secrets” in 
the Great Pyramid. Assuming 
that the number of the days of 
the year had to be hidden in the 
base line of the Great Pyramid, 
Piazzi Smyth divided the base 
line into 365.2422 parts and 
named the unit thus derived the 
“pyramid meter”. This he then 
divided into 25 parts to obtain 
the “pyramid inch”, which turn- 



ed out to be almost the same as 
the English inch. 

Piazzi Smyth quickly conclud- 
ed that the English inch was just 
a faintly corrupted “pyramid 
inch”. Hence the English system 
of measurement by inches really 
went back to ancient Egypt. By 
1870 most of those who played 
around with the dimensions of 
the Great Pyramid had also con- 
cluded that the pyramid had 
been divinely inspired in the 
most literal meaning of the term. 
Hence the inch was sacred. 
Hence it was necessary to form 
a society with the ultimate pur- 
pose of outlawing the “atheist 
metric system”. James Abram 
Garfield, later president of the 
United States, was an active sup- 
porter of this movement against 
the meter. 

The movement did not last 
long. 

Besides, the metric system had 
been legalized in 1866. 



(&)ueAtionS ? 



What are the “lost Messier ob- 
jects?” 

George P. Wallace 
Boston, Mass. 

In 1771 the French astrono- 
mer Charles Messier published 
the first version of his Catalogue 



of Nebulosities, which was a by- 
product of Messier’s main work 
— namely the hunting for new 
comets. Since a comet, before it 
develops a tail, looks like a fuzzy 
star, and since Messier knew 
that there are some objects in 
the sky which always look that 



84 



GALAXY 



way, it was only natural that he 
compile a catalogue of these ob- 
jects so that he would not waste 
observing time on them. 

The objects listed in Messier’s 
catalogue are now referred to 
with numbers preceded by an M. 
M-l for example, is the crab 
nebula, M-13 the globular clus- 
ter in Hercules, M-31 the “neb- 
ula” (galaxy) in Andromeda. 
Two objects, namely M-40 and 
M-91, could not be found by later 
astronomers and are therefore 
called the “lost Messier objects”. 
It is believed that they were faint 
comets which Messier mistook 
for permanent nebulous objects. 

The announcement of the dis- 
covery of a third extra-solar 
planet by Dr. Peter van de Camp 
prompts me to ask whether there 
is any chance of actually seeing 
or at least photographing such 
planets. I understand that the 
new extra-solar planet is a dark 
companion of Barnard’s Star, 
which is itself quite faint, and 
that its presence was deduced 
from the examination of minute 
changes of position of the visi- 
ble star. While I don’t doubt its 
existence, I think it would be a 
reason for rejoicing if the de- 
duction could be verified photo- 
graphically. 

J. D. Carbonara 

Phoenix, Arizona. 



I agree that it would be “rea- 
son for rejoicing” if any one of 
the three extra-solar planets now 
on record (the earlier two are 
those of 61 Cygni and of Lalande 
2185) could be verified photo- 
graphically. I could even cite 
historical precedent. It was 
Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel who 
was the first to deduce the exis- 
tence of a body in space in this 
manner. He deduced the exis- 
tence of a Companion of Sirius, 
and later of a Companion of 
Procyon, and both were discov- 
ered visually at a later date 
when telescopes had grown larg- 
er. But in both cases the com- 
panions were dwarf stars — 
bodies of stellar mass but of 
planetary dimensions. They are 
self-luminous. 

The three extra-solar planets 
now known are of planetary 
mass and planetary dimensions, 
though quite large. The two 
bodies accompanying 61 Cygni 
and Lalande 2185 must have a 
mass of about one per cent of 
the mass of our sun, while the 
“planet” of Barnard’s Star has 
only about one and a half times 
the mass of the planet Jupiter. 
It would be most surprising 
(though not completely impos- 
sible) if they were self-luminous. 

The question of whether a true 
planet, visible by reflected light 
only, could be observed (or just 
seen) over a distance of several 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



85 



light-years has been investigated 
by several astronomers, e. g., the 
late Dr. Otto Struve and Dr. 
Lyman Spitzer. Dr. Spitzer as- 
sumed a planet of the same al- 
bedo as Jupiter, orbiting its star 
at the same distance as Jupiter 
orbits our sun. If that planetary 
system were 16 light-years dis- 
tant the maximum separation of 
star and planet would be one 
second of arc. 

It is easy to make the case 
seem hopeless by saying that a 
separation of one second of arc 
is equal to the diameter of a 
quarter-dollar coin seen from a 
distance of three miles. This is 
quite true, but it is also true 
that it does not need a very large 
telescope to see two luminous 
points which are separated by 
one second of arc. The crux of 
the matter is that both points 
should be of about the same lu- 
minosity for easy separation, 
and a sun and its planet 
differ enormously in lumin- 
osity. If we imagine astron- 
omers 16 light-years away look- 
ing for Jupiter, they would find 
that the sun is approximately 
900 million times as luminous as 
the planet. It is like somebody 
waving a flashlight next to a 
•battery of searchlights. And if 
the astronomers of that other 
planet have to look through an 
atmosphere the case becomes 
hopeless. 



They could improve their lot 
by placing their telescope on an 
atmosphereless satellite and by 
using an occulting disk which 
cuts off as much of the light of 
the star as possible, but will per- 
mit most of the light of the plan- 
et to pass when it is in a favor- 
able position. Even then they 
would need a 300-inch telescope. 
Our time for rejoicing, there- 
fore, won’t come until we have 
a lunar observatory with more 
powerful instruments than we 
have on earth right now. 

Looking through several Al- 
manacs, I notice that the num- 
ber of isotopes for the various 
elements differs from list to list. 
This, I presume, is the result of 
new discoveries. The almanacs 
are for different years. What I 
would like to know is whether 
there are elements which have 
only one isotope. 

Herman Howard 

Manhattan, Kansas. 

If we disregard radioactive 
isotopes, natural or artificial, 
there are eighteen elements 
which have only one stable iso- 
tope. In alphabetical order they 
are: Aluminum, Arsenic, Beryl- 
lium, Caesium, Cobalt, Fluorine, 
Gold, Holmium, Iodine, Mangan- 
ese, Phosphorus, Praseodymium, 
Rhodium, Scandium, Sodium, 
Terbium, Thulium and Yttrium. 



86 



GALAXY 



The element with the largest 
number of stable isotopes is Tin 
which has ten, followed by Cad- 
mium which has eight. The other 
elements have two or more, but 
less than eight, stable isotopes. 
The total number of stable iso- 
topes now known is around 280 . 

Would you please write a 
piece on the names of the arti- 
ficial satellites. What do their 
names mean? 

Marion McNamara 

Salem, Ohio 

Let me begin with the Russian 
satellites because there are fewer 
of them. The first Russian satel- 
lite was named Sputnik, which 
is a Russian word compounded 
from “s” (meaning “with”), 
“put” (pronounced poot, mean- 
ing “road”) and the suffix “nik” 
which makes the word a noun. 
It therefore means “travel com- 
panion”. Incidentally, the Rus- 
sian plural is sputniki. 

The manned capsules are 
named Vostok, which is the Rus- 
sian word for “East”, but the 
name has historical significance. 
The first Russian sailing ship 
which circumnavigated the 
globe happened to be called 
Vostok. The current series of 
Russian research satellites is 
called Cosmos; no explanation 
necessary. The term “Lunik” is 
an invention of American news- 



papermen, not a Russian word 
or designation. The first Rus- 
sian planetary probe was the 
only one which had a name. It 
was called Metchta, which can 
best be translated as “daydream”. 
Since then the Russians have 
become very matter of fact. 
Their Mars probe which is now 
in space is just called “Mars,l”. 

Our first satellite was named 
Explorer and our first to be fired 
over the poles was named Dis- 
coverer, and it has become cus- 
tomary to name satellites in 
polar orbits Discoverers while 
the ones in orbits more or less 
over the equator are named Ex- 
plorers. 

The moon rockets were named 
Pioneer, and later Ranger while 
the planetary probes are called 
Mariner, all three obvious 
names. But some other names 
are less obvious. The satellite 
ANNA has that name because it 
was a joint project of Army, 
Navy, NASA and Air Force. The 
satellite OSO indicated its pur- 
pose: Orbiting Solar Observa- 
tory. One that is coming up will 
be named POGO, from Polar 
Orbiting Geophysical Observa- 
tory. As for Transit, the name 
is clear once you know that it 
is a navigational satellite. The 
Canadian satellite (fired by a 
U. S. rocket from Cape Canaver- 
al) is named Alouette, which is 
French for “Skylark”.

The satellite Syncom is some- 
what more complicated. It means 
a communications satellite in 
the synchronous orbit, 22,300 
miles above the equator, needing 
24 hours to go around the earth 
once and therefore seemingly 
hanging motionless over one 
point of the equator. Midas 
stands for Missile Defense Alarm 
System and Samos for Satellite 
and Missile Observation System. 
Echo was called that because the 
inflated balloon produced an 
echo of radio waves thrown at it, 
while the weather satellites 
Tiros are Television and Infra- 
red Observation Satellites. The 
little satellite Oscar, for the use 
of radio “hams”, had this name 
from the initials of Orbital Sa- 
tellite Carrying Amateur Radio. 

Clumsiest name ever was that 
of Project SCORE back in De- 
cember, 1958. Its name stood for 
Satellite Communications by Or- 
biting Relay Equipment! 

Our local newspaper recently 
printed a release from NASA in 
which the word “meteoroid” was 
used. What is a meteoroid? And 
since I am at it, why are the 
words “meteorite” and “meteor- 
ology” so similar, since they 
mean such different things? 

Elmer Green 

Trenton, New Jersey 



The best way to answer this 
question is to proceed histori- 
cally. The classical Greek word 
meteoros means lofty, or high, 
while the word logos means 
knowledge. Therefore, when Ar- 
istotle wrote a book on weather 
he called it Meteorologica — the 
knowledge of things which hap- 
pen high up — and the science 
of weather and weather forecast- 
ing is still called “meteorology.” 
But Aristotle thought that cer- 
tain phenomena, say shooting 
stars, were events in the atmos- 
phere — which, of course, is cor- 
rect as far as it goes. A shooting 
star is an event taking place in 
the atmosphere; that it was of 
astronomical origin was not 
known in the ancient world. 
Later stones that had fallen out 
of the sky were called meteors 
or meteorites. The two words 
were used interchangeably at 
first — they are still so used in 
several languages — but then 
English astronomical usage be- 
gan to make a sharp distinction. 
A meteorite was the body that 
could be picked up from the 
ground, while the flash it made 
in the sky was the meteor. The 
term meteoroid is -recent, and is 
meant to designate meteorites 
still in space, before they have 
entered the earth’s atmosphere.

OH, 

TO BE

BY PHILIP K. DICK 

ILLUSTRATED BY MORROW 

The trouble with his wife was, 
she wasn't— usually— a woman. 
But ... he wasn't always a man! 



I 

T Te put a twenty-dollar plati- 
num coin into the slot and 
the analyst, after a pause, lit up. 
Its eyes shone with sociability. 
It swiveled about in its chair, 
picked up a pen and pad of long 
yellow paper from its desk and 
said: 

“Good morning, sir. You may 
begin.” 



“Hello, Doctor Jones. I guess 
you’re not the same Doctor Jones 
who did the definitive biography 
of Freud; that was a century 
ago.” He laughed nervously. Be- 
ing a rather poverty-stricken 
man he was not accustomed to 
dealing with the new fully-ho- 
meostatic psychoanalysts. “Um,” 
he said, “should I free-associate 
or give you background material 
or just what?” 



89 



Dr. Jones said, “Perhaps you 
could begin by telling me who 
you are und warum mich — why 
you have selected me.” 

“I’m George Munster of cat- 
walk 4, building WEF-395, San 
Francisco condominium estab- 
lished 1996.” 

“How do you do, Mr. Mun- 
ster.” Dr. Jones held out its hand, 
and George Munster shook it. 
He found the hand to be of a 
pleasant body-temperature and 
decidedly soft. The grip, how- 
ever, was manly. 

“You see,” Munster said, “I’m 
an ex-GI, a war veteran. That’s 
how I got my condominium 
apartment at WEF-395. Veter- 
ans’ preference.” 

“Ah yes,” Dr. Jones said, tick- 
ing faintly as it measured the 
passage of time. “The war with 
the Blobels.” 

“I fought three years in that 
war,” Munster said, nervously 
smoothing his long, black, thin- 
ning hair. “I hated the Blobels 
and I volunteered. I was only 
nineteen and I had a good job 
— but the crusade to clear the 
Sol System of Blobels came first 
in my mind.” 

“Um,” Dr. Jones said, ticking 
and nodding. 

George Munster continued, “I 
fought well. In fact I got two 
decorations and a battlefield ci- 
tation. Corporal. That’s because 
I single-handed wiped out an ob- 



servation satellite full of Blo- 
bels; we’ll never know exactly 
how many because of course, be- 
ing Blobels, they tend to fuse to- 
gether and unfuse confusingly.” 
He broke off then, feeling emo- 
tional. Even remembering and 
talking about the war was too 
much for him. He lay back on 
the couch, lit a cigarette and 
tried to become calm. 

The Blobels had emigrated 
originally from another star sys- 
tem, probably Proxiina. Several 
thousand years ago they had 
settled on Mars and on Titan, 
doing very well at agrarian pur- 
suits. They were developments 
of the original unicellular amoe- 
ba, quite large and with a highly- 
organized nervous system, but 
still amoebae, with pseudopodia, 
reproducing by binary fission, 
and in the main offensive to Ter- 
ran settlers. 

The war itself had broken out 
over ecological considerations. 
It had been the desire of the 
Foreign Aid Department of the 
UN to change the atmosphere on 
Mars, making it more usable for 
Terran settlers. This change, 
however, had made it unpala- 
table for the Blobel colonies al- 
ready there; hence the squabble. 

And, Munster reflected, it was 
not possible to change half the 
atmosphere of a planet, the 
Brownian movement being what 
it was. Within a period of ten

iSES 




OH, TO BE A BLOBEL! 



91 



years the altered atmosphere 
had diffused throughout the 
planet, bringing suffering — at 
least so they alleged — to the 
Blobels. In retaliation, a Blobel 
armada approached Terra and 
put into orbit a series of tech- 
nically sophisticated satellites 
designed eventually to alter the 
atmosphere of Terra. This alter- 
ation had never come about, be- 
cause of course the War Office 
of the UN had gone into action; 
the satellites had been detonated 
by self-instructing missiles . 
and the war was on. 

Dr. Jones said, “Are you mar- 
ried, Mr. Munster?” 

“No sir,” Munster said. “And 
— ” he shuddered — “you’ll see 
why when I’ve finished telling 
you. See, Doctor, I’ll be frank. 
I was a Terran spy. That was my 
task. They gave the job to me 
because of my bravery in the 
field, I didn’t ask for it.” 

“I see,” Dr. Jones said. 

“Do you?” Munster’s voice 
broke. “Do you know what was 
necessary in those days in order 
to make a Terran into a success- 
ful spy among the Blobels?” 
Nodding, Dr. Jones said, “Yes, 
Mr. Munster. You had to relin- 
quish your human form and as- 
sume the form of a Blobel.” 
Munster said nothing; he 
clenched and unclenched his fist 
bitterly. Across from him Dr. 
Jones ticked. 



T hat evening, back in his small 
apartment at WEF-395, Mun- 
ster opened a fifth of Teacher’s 
scotch and sat sipping from a 
cup, lacking even the energy to 
get a glass down from the cup- 
board over the sink. 

What had he gotten out of the 
session with Dr. Jones today? 
Nothing, as nearly as he could 
tell. And it had eaten deep into 
his meager financial resources 
. meager because — 

Because for almost twelve 
hours out of the day he revert- 
ed, despite all the efforts of him- 
self and the Veterans’ Hospitali- 
zation Agency of the UN, to his 
old wartime Blobel shape. To a 
formless unicellular-like blob, 
right in the middle of his own 
apartment at WEF-395. 

His financial resources con- 
sisted of a small pension from 
the War Office. Finding a job 
was impossible, because as soon 
as he was hired the strain caused 
him to revert there on the spot, 
in plain sight of his new em- 
ployer and fellow workers. 

It did not assist in forming 
successful work-relationships. 

Sure enough, now, at eight in 
the evening, he felt himself once 
more beginning to revert. It was 
an old and familiar experience 
to him, and he loathed it. Hur- 
riedly, he sipped the last of the 
cup of scotch, put the cup down 
on a table . and felt himself 



92 



GALAXY 



slide together into a homoge- 
neous puddle. 

The telephone rang. 

“I can’t answer,” he called to 
it. The phone’s relay picked up 
his anguished message and con- 
veyed it to the calling party. 
Now Munster had become a 
single transparent gelatinous 
mass in the middle of the rug. 
He undulated toward the phone 

— it was still ringing, despite his 
statement to it, and he felt furi- 
ous resentment; didn’t he have 
enough troubles already, with- 
out having to deal with a ring- 
ing phone? 

Reaching it, he extended a 
pseudopodium and snatched the 
receiver from the hook. With 
great effort he formed his plastic 
substance into the semblance of 
a vocal apparatus, resonating 
dully. “I’m busy,” he resonated 
in a low booming fashion into 
the mouthpiece of the phone. 
“Call later.” Call, he thought as 
he hung up, tomorrow morning. 
When I’ve been able to regain 
my human form. 

The apartment was quiet now. 

Sighing, Munster flowed back 
across the carpet to the window, 
where he rose into a high pillar 
in order to see the view beyond. 
There was a light-sensitive spot 
on his outer surface, and al- 
though he did not possess a true 
lens he was able to appreciate 

— nostalgically — the blur of 



San Francisco Bay, the Golden 
Gate Bridge, the playground for 
small children which was Alca- 
traz Island. 

Dammit, he thought bitterly. 
I can’t marry; I can’t live a gen-

Office bigshots forced me into 
back in the war times. 

TTe had not known then, when 
A -*■ he accepted the mission, 
that it would leave this perma- 
nent effect. They had assured 
him it was “only temporary, for 
the duration,” or some such glib 
phrase. Duration! Munster 
thought with furious, impotent 
resentment. It’s been eleven 
years. 

The psychological problems 
created for him, the pressure on 
his psyche, were immense. Hence 
his visit to Dr. Jones. 

Once more the phone rang. 

“Okay,” Munster said aloud, 
and flowed laboriously back 
across the room to it. “You want 
to talk to me?” he said as he 
came closer and closer; the trip, 
for someone in Blobel form, was 
a long one. “I’ll talk to you. 
You can even turn on the vid- 
screen and look at me.” At the 
phone he snapped the switch 
which would permit visual com- 
munication as well as auditory. 
“Have a good look,” he said, and 
displayed his amorphous form 



OH, TO BE A BLOBEL!

before the scanning tube of the 
video. 

Dr. Jones’ voice came, “I’m 
sorry to bother you at your 
home, Mr. Munster, especially 
when you’re in this, um, awk- 
ward condition.” The homeosta- 
tic analyst paused. “But I’ve 
been devoting time to prob- 
lem-solving vis-a-vis your condi- 
tion. I may have at least a par- 
tial solution.” 

“What?” Munster said, taken 
by surprise. “You mean to imply 
that medical science can now — ” 

“No, no,” Dr. Jones said hur- 
riedly. “The physical aspects lie 
out of my domain; you must 
keep that in mind, Munster. 
When you consulted me about 
your problems it was the psy- 
chological adjustment that — ” 

“I’ll come right down to your 
office and talk to you,” Munster 
said. And then he realized that 
he could not; in his Blobel form 
it would take him days to un- 
dulate all the way across town 
to Dr. Jones’ office. “Jones,” he 
said desperately, “you see the 
problems I face. I’m stuck here 
in this apartment every night be- 
ginning about eight o’clock and 
lasting through until almost sev- 
• en in the morning. I can’t even 
visit you and consult you and 
get help — ” 

“Be quiet, Mr. Munster,” Dr. 
Jones interrupted. “I’m trying to 
tell you something. You’re not 



the only one in this condition. 
Did you know that?” 

Heavily, Munster said, “Sure. 
In all, eighty-three Terrans were 
made over into Blobels at one 
time or another during the war. 
Of the eighty-three — ” he knew 
the facts by heart — “sixty-one 
survived and now there’s an or- 
ganization called Veterans of Un- 
natural Wars of which fifty are 
members. I’m a member. We 
meet twice a month, revert in 
unison. .” He started to hang 
up the phone. So this was what 
he had gotten for his money, 
this stale news. “Goodbye, Doc- 
tor,” he murmured. 

Dr. Jones whirred in agita- 
tion. “Mr. Munster, I don’t mean 
other Terrans. I’ve researched 
this in your behalf, and I dis- 
cover that according to captured 
records at the Library of Con- 
gress fifteen Blobels were form- 
ed into pseudo-Terrans to act as 
spies for their side. Do you un- 
derstand?” 

After a moment Munster said, 
“Not exactly.” 

“You have a mental block 
against being helped,” Dr. Jones 
said. “But here’s what I want, 
Munster. You be at my office 
at eleven in the morning tomor- 
row. We’ll take up the solution 
to your problem then. Good 
night.” 

Wearily, Munster said, “When 
I’m in my Blobel form my wits 



94 



GALAXY 



aren’t too keen, Doctor. You’ll 
have to forgive me.” He hung 
up, still puzzled. So there were 
fifteen Blobels walking around 
on Titan this moment, doomed 
to occupy human forms — so 
what? How did that help him? 

Maybe he would find out at 
eleven tomorrow. 

'VST'hen he strode into Dr. 

Jones’ waiting room he saw, 
seated in a deep chair in a cor- 
ner by a lamp, reading a copy 
of Fortune, an exceedingly at- 
tractive young woman. 

Automatically, Munster found 
a place to sit from which he 
could eye her. Stylish dyed-white 
hair braided down the back of 
her neck — he took in the sight 
of her with delight, pretending 
to read his own copy of Fortune. 
Slender legs, small and delicate 
elbows. And her sharp, clearly- 
featured face. The intelligent 
eyes, the thin, tapered nostrils 
— a truly lovely girl, he thought. 
He drank in the sight of her . 
until all at once she raised her 
head and stared coolly back at 
him. 

“Dull, having to wait,” Mun- 
ster mumbled. 

The girl said, “Do you come 
to Dr. Jones often?” 

“No,” he admitted. “This is 
just the second time.” 

“I’ve never been here before,” 
the girl said. “I was going to 



another electronic fully-homeo- 
static psychoanalyst in Los An- 
geles and then late yesterday Dr. 
Bing, my analyst, called me and 
told me to fly up here and see 
Dr. Jones this morning. Is this 
one good?” 

“Um,” Munster said. “I guess 
so.” We’ll see, he thought. That’s 
precisely what we don’t know 
yet. 

The inner office door opened 
and there stood Dr. Jones. “Miss 
Arrasmith,” it said, nodding to 
the girl. “Mr. Munster.” It nod- 
ded to George. “Won’t you both 
come in?” 

Rising to her feet, Miss Arra- 
smith said, “Who pays the twen- 
ty dollars, then?” 

But the analyst was silent; it 
had turned off. 

“I’ll pay,” Miss Arrasmith 
said, reaching into her purse. 

“No, no,” Munster said. “Let 
me.” He got out a twenty-dollar 
piece and dropped it into the 
analyst’s slot. 

At once, Dr. Jones said, 
“You’re a gentleman, Mr. Mun- 
ster.” Smiling, it ushered the 
two of them into its office. “Be 
seated, please. Miss Arrasmith, 
without preamble please allow 
me to explain your — condition 
to Mr. Munster.” To Munster it 
said, “Miss Arrasmith is a Blo- 
bel.” 

Munster could only stare at the 
girl. 



OH, TO BE A BLOBEL1

“Obviously,” Dr. Jones contin- 
ued, “presently in human form. 
This, for her, is the state of in- 
voluntary reversion. During the 
war she operated behind Terran 
lines, acting for the Blobel War 
League. She was captured and 
held, but then the war ended 
and she was not tried.” 

“They released me,” Miss Ar- 
rasmith said in a low, carefully 
controlled voice. “Still in human 
form. I stayed here out of shame. 
I just couldn’t go back to Titan 
and — ” Her voice wavered. 

“There is great shame attach- 
ed to this condition,” Dr. Jones 
said, “for any high-caste Blobel.” 

Nodding, Miss Arrasmith sat 
clutching a tiny Irish linen 
handkerchief and trying to look 
poised. “Correct, Doctor. I did 
visit Titan to discuss my condi- 
tion with medical authorities 
there. After expensive and pro- 
longed therapy with me they 
were able to induce a return to 
my natural form for a period of 
about one-fourth of the time. 
But the other three-fourths ... I 
am as you perceive me now.” She 
ducked her head and touched the 
handkerchief to her right eye. 

“Jeez,” Munster protested, 
“you’re lucky! A human form 
is infinitely superior to a Blobel 
form. I ought to know. As a Blo- 
bel you have to creep along. 
You’re like a big jellyfish, no 
skeleton to keep you erect. And 



binary fission — it’s lousy, I say 
really lousy, compared to the 
Terran form of — you know. Re- 
production.” He colored. 

Dr. Jones ticked and stated, 
“For a period of about six hours 
your human forms overlap. And 
then for about one hour your 
Blobel forms overlap. So all in 
all, the two of you possess seven 
hours out of twenty-four in 
which you both possess identi- 
cal forms. In my opinion — ” it 
toyed with its pen and paper — 
“seven hours is not too bad, if 
you follow my meaning.” 

After a moment Miss Arra- 
smith said, “But Mr. Munster 
and I are natural enemies.” 

“That was years ago,” Mun- 
ster said. 

“Correct,” Dr. Jones agreed. 
“True, Miss Arrasmith is basical- 
ly a Blobel and you, Munster, are 
a Terran. But both of you are 
outcasts in either civilization. 
Both of you are stateless and 
hence gradually suffering a loss 
of ego-identity. I predict for 
both of you a gradual deteriora- 
tion ending finally in severe 
mental illness. Unless you two 
can develop a rapprochement.” 
The analyst was silent then. 

Miss Arrasmith said softly, “I 
think we’re very lucky, Mr. Mun- 
ster. As Dr. Jones said, we do 
overlap for seven hours day . 
we can enjoy that time together, 
no longer in wretched isolation.”

She smiled up hopefully at him, 
rearranging her coat. Certainly, 
she had a nice figure; the some- 
what low-cut dress gave an ideal 
clue to that. 

Studying her, Munster pon- 
dered. 

“Give him time,” Dr. Jones told 
Miss Arrasmith. “My analysis 
of him is that he will see this 
correctly and do the right thing.” 

Still rearranging her coat and 
dabbing at her large, dark eyes, 
Miss Arrasmith waited. 

II 

'T'he phone in Dr. Jones’ office 
rang, a number of years later. 
He answered it in his customary 
way. “Please, sir or madam, de- 
posit twenty dollars if you wish 
to speak to me.” 

A tough male voice on the 
other end of the line said, “Lis- 
ten, this is the UN Legal Office 
and we don’t deposit twenty dol- 
lars to talk to anybody. So trip 
that mechanism inside you, 
Jones.” 

“Yes, sir,” Dr. Jones said, and 
with his right hand tripped the 
lever behind his ear that caused 
him to come on free. 

“Back in 2037,” the UN legal 
expert said, “did you advise a 
couple to marry? A George 
Munster and a Vivian Arra- 
smith, now Mrs. Munster?” 

“Why yes,” Dr. Jones said, af- 



ter consulting his built-in mem- 
ory banks. 

“Had you investigated the 
legal ramifications of their is- 
sue?” 

“Um, well,” Dr. Jones said, 
“that’s not my worry.” 

“You can be arraigned for ad- 
vising any action contrary to 
UN law.” 

“There’s no law prohibiting a 
Blobel and a Terran from mar- 
rying.” 

The UN legal expert said, “All 
right, Doctor, I’ll settle for a look 
at their case histories.” 

“Absolutely no,” Dr. Jones 
said. “That would be a breach 
of ethics.” 

“We’ll get a writ and sequester 
them, then.” 

“Go ahead.” Dr. Jones reached 
behind his ear to shut himself 
off. 

“Wait. It may interest you to 
know that the Munsters now 
have four children. And, follow- 
ing the Revised Mendelian Law, 
the offspring comprise a strict 
one, two, one ratio. One Blobel 
girl, one hybrid boy, one hybrid 
girl, one Terran girl. The legal 
problem arises in that the Blo- 
bel Supreme Council claims the 
pure-blooded Blobel girl as a 
citizen of Titan and also suggests 
that one of the two hybrids be 
donated to the Council’s juris- 
diction.” The UN legal expert 
explained, “You see, the Mun- 



OH, TO BE A BLOBEL! 



97 



sters’ marriage is breaking up. 
They’re getting divorced and it’s 
sticky finding which laws obtain 
regarding them and their issue.” 
“Yes,” Dr. Jones admitted, “I 
would think so. What has caused 
their marriage to break up?” 

“I don’t know and don’t care. 
Possibly the fact that both adults 
rotate daily between being Blo- 
bels and Terrans. Maybe the 
strain got to be too much. If you 
want to give them psychological 
advice, consult them. Goodbye.” 
The UN legal expert rang off. 

Did I make a mistake, advis- 
ing them to marry? Dr. Jones 
asked itself. I wonder if I 
shouldn’t look them up; I owe 
at least that to them. 

Opening the Los Angeles 
Phonebook, it began thumbing 
through the Ms. 

nphese had been six difficult 
years for the Munsters. 
First George had moved from 
San Francisco to Los Angeles. 
He and Vivian had set up their 
household in a condominium 
apartment with three instead of 
two rooms. Vivian, being in Ter- 
ran form three-fourths of the 
time, had been able to obtain a 
job; right out in public she gave 
jet flight information at the 
Fifth Los Angeles Airport. 
George, however — 

His pension comprised an 
amount only one-forth that of 



his wife’s salary and he felt it 
keenly. To augment it, he had 
searched for a way of earning 
money at home. Finally in a 
magazine he had found this valu- 
able ad; 

MAKE SWIFT PROFITS IN YOUR OWN 
CONDO! RAISE GIANT BULLFROGS FROM 
JUPITER, CAPABLE OF EIGHTY-FOOT 
LEAPS CAN BE USED IN FROG-RACING 
(where legal) AND — 

So in 2038 he had bought his 
first pair of frogs imported from 
Jupiter and had begun raising 
them for swift profits, right in 
his own condominium apart- 
ment building, in a corner of 
the basement that Leopold, the 
partially-homeostatic janitor, let 
him use gratis. 

But in the relatively feeble 
Terran gravity the .frogs were 
capable of enormous leaps, and 
the basement proved too small 
for them; they ricocheted from 
wall to wall like green pingpong 
balls and soon died. Obviously 
it took more than a portion of 
the basement at QEK-604 Apart- 
ments to house a crop of the 
damned things, George realized. 

And then, too, their first child 
had been bom. It had turned 
out to be pure-blooded Blobel; 
for twenty-four hours a day it 
consisted of a gelatinous mass 
and George found himself wait- 
ing in vain for it to switch over 



98

V 



to a human form, even for a mo- 
ment. 

He faced Vivian defiantly in 
this matter, during a period 
when both of them were in hu- 
man form. 

“How can I consider it my 
child?” he asked her. “It’s an 
alien life form to me.” He was 
discouraged and even horrified. 
“Dr. Jones should have foreseen 
this. Maybe it’s your child — it 
looks just like you.” 

Tears filled Vivian’s eyes. 
“You mean that insultingly.” 

“Damn right I do. We fought 
you creatures. We used to con- 
sider you no better than Portu- 
guese men-o’-war.” Gloomily, he 
put on his coat. “I’m going 
down to Veterans of Unnatural 
Wars Headquarters,” he inform- 
ed his wife. “Have a beer with 
the boys.” Shortly he was on 
his. way to join with his old war- 
time buddies, glad to get out of 
the apartment house. 

VUW Headquarters was a de- 
crepit cement building in down- 
town Los Angeles, left over from 
the twentieth century and sadly 
in need of paint. The VUW had 
little funds because most of its 
members were, like George Mun- 
ster, living on UN pensions. 
However, there was a pool table 
and an old 3-D television set and 
a few dozen tapes of popular 
music and also a chess set. 
George generally drank his beer 



and played chess with his fellow 
members, either in human form 
or in Blobel form; this was one 
place in which both were ac- 
cepted. 

This particular evening he sat 
with Pete Ruggles, a fellow vet- 
eran who also had married a 
Blobel female, reverting, as Vi- 
vian did, to human form. 

“Pete, I can’t go on. I’ve got 
a gelatinous blob for a child. My 
whole life I’ve wanted a kid, and 
now what have I got? Something 
that looks like it washed up on 
the beach.” 

Sipping his beer — he too was 
in human form at the moment 
— Pete answered, “Criminy, 
George, I admit it’s a mess. But 
you must have known what you 
were getting into when you mar- 
ried her. And my God, accord- 
ing to Mendel’s Revised Law, the 
next kid — ” 

George broke in, “I mean I 
don’t respect my own wife. 
That’s the basis of it. I think of 
her as a thing. And myself, too. 
We’re both things.” He drank 
down his beer in one gulp. 

Pete said meditatively, “But 
from the Blobel standpoint — ” 

“Listen, whose side are you 
on?” George demanded. 

“Don’t yell at me,” Pete said, 
“or I’ll deck you.” 

A moment later they were 
swinging wildly at each other. 
Fortunately Pete reverted to Blo- 



OH, TO BE A BLOBEL! 



99 



bel form in the nick of time; no 
harm was done. Now George sat 
alone, in human shape, while 
Pete oozed off somewhere else, 
probably to join a group of the 
boys who had also assumed Blo- 
bel form. 

Maybe we can found a new 
society somewhere on a remote 
moon, George said to himself. 
Neither Terran nor Blobel. 

I’ve got to go back to Vivian, 
George resolved. What else is 
there for me? I’m lucky to find 
her; I’d be nothing but a war 
veteran guzzling beer here at 
VUW Headquarters every damn 
day and night, with no future, 
no hope, no real life. 

He had a new money-making 
scheme going now. It was a home 
mail-order business; he had 
placed an ad in the Saturday 
Evening Post for MAGIC 
LODESTONES REPUTED TO 
BRING YOU LUCK. FROM 
ANOTHER STAR-SYSTEM 
ENTIRELY! The stones had 
come from Proxima and were ob- 
tainable on Titan; it was Vivian 
who had made the commercial 
contact for him with her people. 
But so far, few people had sent 
in the dollar-fifty. 

I’m a failure, George said to 
himself. 



T^ortunately the next child, 
bom in the winter of 2039, 
showed itself to be a hybrid. It 



100 



took human form fifty per cent 
of the time, and so at last George 
had a child who was — occasion- 
ally, anyhow — a member of his 
own species. 

He was still in the process of 
celebrating the birth of Maurice 
when a delegation of their neigh- 
bors at QEK-604 Apartments 
came and rapped on their door. 

“We’ve got a petition here,” 
the chairman of the delegation 
said, shuffling his feet in embar- 
rassment, “asking that you and 
Mrs. Munster leave QEK-604.” 

“But why?” George asked, be- 
wildered. “You haven’t object- 
ed to us up until now.” 

“The reason is that now you’ve 
got a hybrid youngster who will 
want to play with ours, and we 
feel it’s unhealthy for our kids 
to—” 

George slammed the door in 
their faces. 

But still he felt the pressure 
of the hostility from the people 
on all sides of them. And to 
think, he thought bitterly, that 
I fought in the war to save these 
people! It sure wasn’t worth it! 

An hour later he was down at 
VUW Headquarters once more, 
drinking beer and talking with 
his buddy Sherman Downs, also 
married to a Blobel. 

“Sherman, it’s no good. We’re 
not wanted; we’ve got to emi- 
grate. Maybe we’ll try it on Titan 
in Viv’s world.” 



GALAXY 



“Chrissakes,” Sherman protest- 
ed, “I hate to see you fold up, 
George. Isn’t your electro-mag- 
netic reducing belt beginning to 
sell, finally?” 

For the last few months, 
George had been making and 
selling a complex electronic re- 
ducing gadget which Vivian had 
helped him design; it was based 
in principle on a Blobel device 
popular on Titan but unknown 
on Terra. And this had gone over 
well. George had more orders 
than he could fill. But — 

“I had a terrible experience, 
Sherm,” George confided. “I was 
in a drugstore the other day, and 
they gave me a big order for my 
reducing belt, and I got so ex- 
cited — ” He broke off. “You can 
guess what happened. I revert- 
ed, right in plain sight of a hun- 
dred customers. And when the 
buyer saw that he canceled the 
order for the belts. It was what 
we all fear. You should have 
seen how their attitude toward 
me changed.” 

Sherm said, “Hire someone to 
do your selling for you. A full- 
blooded Terran.” 

Thickly, George said, “I’m a 
full-blooded Terran, and don’t 
you forget it. Ever.” 

“I just mean — ” 

“I know what you meant,” 
George said. And took a swing 
at Sherman. Fortunately he miss- 
ed and in the excitement both 



of them reverted to Blobel form. 
They oozed angrily into each 
other for a time, but at last fel- 
low veterans managed to sepa- 
rate them. 

“I’m as much a Terran as any- 
one,” George thought-radiated in 
the Blobel manner to Sherman. 
“And I’ll flatten anyone who 
says otherwise.” 

In Blobel form he was unable 
to get home; he had to phone 
Vivian to come and get him. It 
was humiliating. 

Suicide, he decided. That’s the 
answer. 

How best to do it? In Blobel 
form he was unable to feel pain; 
best to do it then. Several sub- 
stances would dissolve him ... he 
could, for instance, drop himself 
into a heavily-chlorinated swim- 
ming pool, such as QEK-604 
maintained in its recreation 
room. 

Vivian, in human form, found 
him as he reposed hesitantly at 
the edge of the swimming pool, 
late one night. 

“George, I beg you — go back 
to Dr. Jones.” 

“Naw,” he boomed dully, 
forming a quasi-vocal apparatus 
with a portion of his body. “It’s 
no use, Viv. I don’t want to go 
on.” Even the belts; they had 
been Viv’s idea, rather than his. 
He was second even there . be- 
hind her, falling constantly fur- 
ther behind each passing day. 



OH, TO BE A BLOBEL1 



101 



Viv said, “You have so much 
to offer the children.” 

That was true. “Maybe 111 
drop over to the UN War Of- 
fice,” he decided. “Talk to them, 
see if there’s anything new that 
medical science has come up 
with that might stabilize me.” 
“But if you stabilize as a Ter- 
ran,” Vivian said, “what would 
become of me?” 

“We’d have eighteen entire 
hours together a day. All the 
hours you take human form!” 
“But you wouldn’t want to 
stay married to me. Because, 
George, then you could meet a 
Terran woman.” 

It wasn’t fair to her, he real- 
ized. So he abandoned the idea. 

In the spring of 2041 their 
third child was bom, also a girl, 
and like Maurice a hybrid. It 
was Blobel at night and Terran 
by day. 

Meanwhile, George found a 
solution to some of his problems. 
He got himself a mistress. 

Ill 

A t the Hotel Elysium, a run- 
down wooden building in 
the heart of Los Angeles, he and 
Nina arranged to meet one an- 
other. 

“Nina,” George said, sipping 
Teacher’s scotch and seated be- 
side her on the shabby sofa 
which the hotel provided, 



“you’ve made my life worth liv- 
ing again.” He fooled with the 
buttons of her blouse. 

“I respect you,” Nina Glaub- 
man said, assisting him with the 
buttons. “In spite of the fact — 
well, you are a former enemy 
of the people.” 

George protested, “We must 
not think about the old days. We 
have to close our minds to our 
pasts.” Nothing but our future, 
he thought. 

His reducing belt enterprise 
had developed so well that now 
he employed fifteen full-time 
Terran employees and owned a 
small, modern factory on the 
outskirts of San Fernando. If UN 
taxes had been reasonable he 
would by now be a wealthy man. 
Brooding on that, George won- 
dered what the tax rate was in 
Blobel-run lands, on Io, for in- 
stance. Maybe he ought to look 
into it. 

One night at VUW Headquar- 
ters he discussed the subject 
with Reinholt, Nina’s husband, 
who of course was ignorant of 
the modus Vivendi between 
George and Nina. 

“Reinholt,” George said with 
difficulty, as he drank his beer, 
“I’ve got big plans. This cradle- 
to-grave socialism the UN oper- 
ates . it’s not for me. It’s 
cramping me. The Munster Mag- 
ic Magnetic Belt is — ” he ges- 
tured — “more than Terran civ- 



102 



GALAXY 



ilization can support. You get 
me?” 

Coldly, Reinholt said, “But 
George, you are a Terran. If you 
emigrate to Blobel-run territory 
with your factory you’ll be be- 

aying your — ” 

“Listen,” George told him, 
“I’ve got one authentic Blobel 
child, two half-Blobel children, 
and a fourth on the way. I’ve 
got strong emotional ties with 
those people out there on Titan 
and Io.” 

“ “You’re a traitor,” Reinholt 
said, and punched him in the 
mouth. “And not only that,” he 
continued, punching George in 
the stomach, “you’re running 
around with my wife. I’m going 
to kill you.” 

To escape, George reverted to 
Blobel form; Reinholt’s blows 
passed harmlessly deep into his 
moist, jelly-like substance. Rein- 
holt then reverted, too, and flow- 
ed into him murderously, trying 
to consume and absorb George’s 
nucleus. 

Fortunately fellow veterans 
pried their two bodies apart be- 
fore any permanent harm was 
done. 

Later that night, still trem- 
bling, George sat with Vivian in 
the living room of their eight- 
room suite at the great new con- 
dominium apartment building 
ZGF-900. It had been a close 
call, and now of course Reinholt 



would tell Viv. It was only a 
question of time. The marriage, 
as far as George could see, was 
over. This perhaps was their last 
moment together. 

“Viv,” he said urgently, “you 
have to believe me; I love you. 
You and the children — plus the 
belt business, naturally — are 
my complete life.” A desperate 
idea came to him. “Let’s emi- 
grate now, tonight. Pack up the 
kids and go to Titan, right this 
minute.” 

“I can’t go,” Vivian said. “I 
know how my people would treat 
me, and treat you and the chil- 
dren, too. George, you go. Move 
the factory to Io. I’ll stay here.” 
Tears filled her dark eyes. 

“Hell,” George said, “what 
kind of life is that? With you 
on Terra and me on Io — that’s 
no marriage. And who’ll get the 
kids?” Probably Viv would get 
them. But his firm employed top 
legal talent — perhaps he could 
use it to solve his domestic prob- 
lems. 

The next morning Vivian 
found out about Nina. And hired 
an attorney of her own. 

ICT isten,” George said, on the 
' phone talking to his top 
legal talent, Henry Ramarau. 
“Get me custody of the fourth 
child; it’ll be a Terran. And 
we’ll compromise on the two 
hybrids; I’ll take Maurice and 



OH, TO BE A BLOBEL!

she can have Kathy. And natur- 
ally she gets that blob, that first 
so-called child. As far as I’m 
concerned it’s hers anyhow.” He 
slammed the receiver down and 
then turned to the board of di- 
rectors of his company. “Now 
where were we in our analysis of 
Io tax laws?” 

During the next weeks the idea 
of a move to Io appeared more 
and more feasible from a profit 
and loss standpoint. 

“Go ahead and buy land on 
Io,” George instructed his busi- 
ness agent in the field, Tom 
Hendricks. “And get it cheap. 
We want to start right.” To his 
secretary Miss Nolan he said, 
“Now keep everyone out of my 
office until further notice. I feel 
an attack coming on, from anx- 
iety over this major move off 
Terra to Io.” He added, “And 
personal worries.” 

“Yes, Mr. Munster,” Miss No- 
lan said, ushering Tom Hen- 
dricks out of George’s private of- 
fice. “No one will disturb you.” 
She could be counted on to keep 
everyone out while George re- 
verted to his war-time Blobel 
shape, as he often did these days. 
The pressure on him was im- 
mense. 

When, later in the day, he re- 
sumed human form, George 
learned from Miss Nolan that a 
Doctor Jones had called. 

“I’ll be damned,” George said, 



thinking back to six years ago. 
“I thought it’d be in the junk 
pile by now.” To Miss Nolan he 
said, “Call Doctor Jones and no- 
tify me when you have it. I’ll 
take a minute off to talk to it.” 
It was like old times, back in 
San Francisco. 

Shortly Miss Nolan had Dr. 
Jones on the line. 

“Doctor,” George said, leaning 
from side to side and poking at 
an orchid on his desk. “Good to 
hear from you.” 

The voice of the homeostatic 
analyst came in his ear, “Mr. 
Munster, I note that you now 
have a secretary.” 

“Yes,” George said, “I’m a ty- 
coon. I’m in the reducing belt 
game; it’s somewhat like the 
flea-collar that cats wear. Well, 
what can I do for you?” 

“I understand you have four 
children now — ” 

“Actually three, plus a fourth 
on the way. Listen, that fourth, 
Doctor, is vital to me; accord- 
ing to Mendel’s Revised Law it’s 
a full-blooded Terran and by 
God I’m doing everything in my 
power to get custody of it.” He 
added, “Vivian — you remem- 
ber her — is now back on Titan. 
Among her own people, where 
she belongs. And I’m putting 
some of the finest doctors I can 
get on my payroll to stabilize 
me. I’m tired of this constant re- 
verting, night and day; I’ve got 



104 



GALAXY 



too much to do for such non- 
sense.” 

Dr. Jones said, . “From your 
tone I can see you’re an impor- 
tant, busy man, Mr. Munster. 
You’ve certainly risen in the 
world since I saw you last.” 

“Get to the point, Doctor,” 
George said impatiently. 

“I, um, thought perhaps I 
could bring you and Vivian to- 
gether again.” 

“Bah,” George said contemp- 
tuously. “That woman? Never. 
Listen, Doctor, I have to ring 
off. We’re in the process of final- 
izing on some basic business 
strategy, here at Munster, Incor- 
porated.” 

“Mr. Munster,” Dr. Jones ask- 
ed, “is there another woman?” 

“There’s another Blobel,” 
George said, “if that’s what you 
mean.” And he hung up the 
phone. Two Blobels are better 
than none, he said to himself. 
And now back to business. He 
pressed a button his desk and 
at once Miss Nolan put her head 
into the office. “Miss Nolan,” 
George said, “get me Hank Ra- 
marau; I want to find out — ” 

“Mr. Ramarau is waiting on 
the other line,” Miss Nolan said. 
“He says it’s urgent.” 

Switching to the other line, 
George said, “Hi, Hank. What’s 
up?” 

“I’ve just discovered,” his top 
legal advisor said, “that to oper- 



ate your factory on Io you must 
be a citizen of Titan.” 

“We ought to be able to fix 
that up,” George said. 

“But to be a citizen of Titan 
— ” Ramarau hesitated. “I’ll 
break it to you as easy as I can, 
George. You have to be a 
Blobel!” 

“Dammit, I am a Blobel!” 
George said. “At least part of 
the time. Won’t that do?” 

“No,” Ramarau said, “I check- 
ed into that, knowing of your 
affliction, and it’s got to be one 
hundred per cent of the time. 
Night and day.” 

“Hmmm,” George said. “This 
is bad. But we’ll overcome it 
somehow. Listen, Hank, I’ve got 
an appointment with Eddy Full- 
bright, my medical coordinator. 
I’ll talk to you after, okay?” He 
ran off and then sat scowling 
and rubbing his jaw. Well, he 
decided, if it has to be. Facts 
are facts, and we can’t let them 
stand in our way. 

Picking up the phone he dial- 
ed his doctor, Eddy Fullbright.

'T'he twenty-dollar platinum 
coin rolled down the chute 
and tripped the circuit. Dr. 
Jones came on, glanced up and 
saw a stunning, sharp-breasted 
young woman whom it recog- 
nized by means of a quick scan

of its memory banks as Mrs. 
George Munster, the former Viv- 
ian Arrasmith. 

“Good day, Vivian,” Dr. Jones 
said cordially. “But I under- 
stood you were pn Titan.” It rose 
to its feet, offering her a chair. 

Dabbing at her large, dark 
eyes, Vivian sniffled, “Doctor, 
everything is collapsing around 
me. My husband is having an 
affair with another woman . 
all I know is that her name is 
Nina and all the boys down at 
VUW Headquarters are talking 
about it. Presumably she’s a Ter- 
ran. We’re both filing for di- 
vorce. And we’re having a dread- 
ful legal battle over the chil- 
dren.” She arranged her coat 
modestly. “I’m expecting. Our 
fourth.” 

“This I know,” Dr. Jones said. 
“A full-blooded Terran this time, 
if Mendel’s Law holds ... al- 
though I thought it only applied 
to litters.” 

Mrs. Munster said miserably, 
“I’ve been on Titan talking to 
legal and medical experts, gyne- 
cologists and especially marital 
guidance counselors. I’ve had all 
sorts of advice during the past 
month. Now I’m back on Terra 
but I can’t find George — he’s 
gone.” 

“I wish I could help you, Viv- 
ian,” Dr. Jones said. “I talked to 
your husband briefly the other 
day, but he spoke only in gen- 



eralities. Evidently he’s such a 
big tycoon now that it’s hard to 
approach him.” 

“And to think,” Vivian 
sniffled, “that he achieved it all 
because of an idea I gave him. A 
Blobel idea.” 

“The ironies of fate,” Dr. 
Jones said. “Now, if you want 
to keep your husband, Vivian — ” 
“I’m determined to keep him, 
Doctor Jones. Frankly I’ve un- 
dergone therapy on Titan, the 

latest and most expensive it’s 

because I love George so much, 
even more than I love my own 
people or my planet.” 

“Eh?” Dr. Jones said. 
“Through the most modern 
developments in medical science 
in the Sol System,” Vivian said, 
“I’ve been stabilized, Doctor 
Jones. Now I am in human form 
twenty-four hours a day instead 
of eighteen. I’ve renounced my 
natural form in order to keep 
my marriage with George.” 
“The supreme sacrifice,” Dr. 
Jones said, touched. 

“Now, if I can only find him, 
Doctor — ” 

\ t the ground-breaking cere- 
monies on lo, George Mun- 
ster flowed gradually to the 
shovel, extended a pseudopodi- 
um, seized the shovel, and with 
it managed to dig a symbolic 
amount of soil. “This is a great 
day,” he boomed hollowly, by 



106 



GALAXY 



means of the semblance of a vo- 
cal apparatus into which he had 
fashioned the slimy, plastic sub- 
stance which made up his unicel- 
lular body. 

“Right, George,” Hank Rama- 
rau agreed, standing nearby with 
the legal documents. 

The Ionan official, like George 
a great transparent blob, oozed 
across to Ramarau, took the doc- 
uments and boomed, “These will 
be transmitted to my govern- 
ment. I’m sure they’re in order, 
Mr. Ramarau.” 

“I guarantee you,” Ramarau 
said to the official, “Mr. Mun- 
ster does not revert to human 
form at any time. He’s made use 
of some of the most advanced 
techniques in medical science to 
achieve this stability at the uni- 
cellular phase of his former ro- 
tation. Munster would never 
cheat.” 

“This historic moment,” the 
great blob that was George Mun- 
ster thought- radiated to the 
throng of local Blobels attend- 
ing the ceremonies, “means a 
higher standard of living for 



Ionans who will be employed. 
It will bring prosperity to this 
area, plus a proud sense of na- 
tional achievement in the manu- 
facture of what we recognize to 
be a native invention, the Mun- 
ster Magic Magnetic Belt.” 

The throng of Blobels 
thought-radiated cheers. 

“This is a proud day in my 
life,” George Munster informed 
them, and began to ooze by de- 
grees back to his car, where his 
chauffeur waited to drive him 
to his permanent hotel room at 
Io City. 

Someday he would own the 
hotel. He was putting the pro- 
fits from his business in local 
real estate. It was the patriotic 
— and the profitable — thing to 
do, other Ionans, other Blobels, 
had told him. 

“I’m finally a successful man,” 
George Munster thought-radiat- 
ed to all close enough to pick up 
his emanations. 

Amid frenzied cheers he oozed 
up the ramp and into his Titan- 
made car.

m i: 

AWAKENING 

BY JACK SHARKEY 

They awoke after ages of hiding 
—to emerge into a world richer 
than they had dared to dream of! 



T) ik’s first impressions were an 
uncomfortable chill creeping 
along his bare flesh, and a bright 
milky swirling of light that en- 
compassed his entire vision. He 
shivered and blinked his eyes a 
few times, and then the swirling 
settled down and became the 
vault. The chill, he realized, was 
due to the body warmth being 
methodically sucked away by the 
cold slab on which he lay. An- 
other shiver brought a gasp of 
breath into his lungs, and then 
he was wide awake. 



When he sat up and swung his 
legs over the side, the interior 
of the vault began swirling 
again. He had to grip the edge 
of the slab to keep from falling. 
The air was humid, much too 
humid, and he could taste the 
prickly presence of carbon di- 
oxide when he breathed. “The 
pump,” he mumbled, dropping 
to the floor on feet that he could 
barely control. “Something’s 
happened to the pump.” 

He pushed himself deter- 
minedly erect, then stumbled 



108 



down the long corridor between 
the other slabs, hardly glancing 
at their silent tenants, until he 
got to Zina’s. She lay still as 
death, not flicking so -much as 
an eyelid, and her flesh was like 
frozen wax beneath his explor- 
ing fingers. 

There was nothing he could 
do for her until he got the pump 
working again. 

Rik pushed away from the 
slab on which Zina lay, and went 
through the archway into the 
next chamber. Here another fifty 
of the group lay on their slabs, 
not so much as a muscle twitch 
betraying the fact that they were 
all quite alive. It seemed only 
a few hours since he had lain 
down on his slab in the other 
room and gotten his injection, 
but he could not, for a dizzy mo- 
ment, recall in which direction 
the pump lay. His mind seemed 
to be plumbing dust-covered 
depths to dredge out his mem- 
ories, one by one. 

He suddenly remembered the 
War. The war that had driven 
the group to build this place, to 
try and safeguard a handful from 
the holocaust that would set fire 
to the surface of the world and 
turn the seas to steam. Was it 
possible the war had passed? Or 
had it ever come! 

There was no way to know 
without going outside — Wait! 
There was! Rik thought hard. 



trying to get his sense of direc- 
tion back. The atom-powered 
clock that marked off months in- 
stead of minutes was in the cen- 
tral vault, where the elders slept. 
The other nine vaults ringed 
that one, he recalled, veering at 
right angles to his first direction, 
which would have taken him on 
a circular tour of the nine vaults 
and back to his starting place 
again. 

The archway to the vault of 
the elders was unaccountably 
blocked, and Rik realized sud- 
denly that part of the ceiling 
there had fallen, carried by 
some fault in the granite of the 
mountain itself. But that was 
impossible! The elders had se- 
lected this site on the basis of 
the rigidity of the rocky strata 
that made it up. A fault could 
not have occurred for more 
years than Rik’s own lifetime — 

Or had that many years passed 
already? 

'T'here was no way of knowing; 

not until he had examined the 
clock. Rik moved away from the 
blockade and made his way into 
the next vault, and the next, fin- 
ally finding an archway in the 
sixth vault from his own where 
the rock had not completely 
sealed the way into the elders’ 
vault. 

Here he had expected to find 
the air fresher, already having 



THE AWAKENING 



109 



theorized that the staleness else- 
where was due to the poor circu- 
lation occasioned by the block- 
aded central vault. But in fact 
the air there was even worse, 
and laden with an odor that 
made Rik suddenly afraid to see 
its source. 

Still, he was the first to awake. 
It was up to him to try and save 
himself and the others. Rik made 
an effort of will, and then 
squeezed through the narrow ori- 
fice into the main chamber. He 
looked once toward the slabs 
holding the bodies of the elders, 
then quickly away. It was true. 
All were in advanced stages of 
corruption already. 

Choking, Rik went to the cen- 
ter of the high room and looked 
into the horizontal face of the 
clock. The broad indicator arm 
was at its utmost numeral, and 
was pocked with rust. They’d 
lain here beyond the time-of- 
awakening by at least four times 
the years they’d planned! 

“It can’t be right,” Rik gasped, 
his brain reeling for want of 
clean, cool air. “The mechanism 
has failed somehow.” Afraid to 
think about it, he tilted the clock 
up on its base until the pedestal 
which supported it lay on its 
side upon the floor. The square 
block of metal that based the 
pedestal was now uptilted be- 
yond the vertical, exposing a 
gaping trap in the floor. Rik did 



not like the tarnished look of 
the metal underside of the ped- 
estal-base, forged of an alloy 
supposed to be incorruptible. A 
sick thought took hold of his 
insides then, as he placed one 
foot upon the rocky staircase un- 
der the floor. The clock-indica- 
tor had halted at its utmost num- 
eral. 

But what if they’d lain here 
even longer than that? There 
would be no way of knowing. 
No way at all. 

He descended the staircase 
swiftly then, glad at least that 
the air was better down in the 
pump chamber. “It would be, of 
course,” he reminded himself, 
“if the pump went off, even. This 
air would never be circulated, 
never have its chance to become 
corrupt with our exhalations.” 
And then his musing was halted 
in midthought as he came upon 
the pump. Or upon what had 
been the pump. 

Where rigid cylinders of 
gleaming metal had been, a few 
jagged teeth of brown corrup- 
tion lay in a circle. The pistons 
were no better, though their 
thickness had preserved more of 
their original shape despite the 
inroads of age, so they could be 
recognized for what they were — 
had been. The central shaft was 
a long mqund of flaking dust on 
the floor between the path of 
the pistons, and the wall -sized 



no 



GALAXY 



mass of the filters — woven of 
metal and powerful synthetic 
fibers — crumbled beneath the 
pressure of his finger. 

He sought and found the pon- 
derous casing in which the en- 
gine-empowering radioactive ele- 
ment had lain, and its thick 
walls tore away like wood pulp 
in his hands. The element, when 
he found it, was already become 
cold grey lead. And it had had 
a half-life of centuries. 

Rik crumpled slowly to the 
floor, shutting his eyes, trying 
not to think of the eons which 
must have passed while they all 
lay sleeping the pseudodeath in 
the vaults. What might the world 
have become in the interim! 

\ current of cool air suddenly 
-‘^-touched his face. His head 
came up instantly, his eyes seek- 
ing the source. 

A feathery motion of torn 
edges in the filter showed him 
that it came through the gap he 
had torn there. Rik sprang to 
his feet then, leaped at the filter 
and tore out chunks by the arm- 
ful, letting the pulverized ma- 
terial float in spinning clouds 
of dust motes behind him. The 
air grew stronger, came faster, 
as he ripped away the corrup- 
tion, and then he could see the 
tunnel beyond. 

Gasping at the effort — how 
long since he had eaten? — he 



staggered back from the open- 
ing then back up the stairs into 
the chamber of the elders. Now 
that his nostrils had been stimu- 
lated by the clean air the smell 
of corruption was violently re- 
pelling; but he held his breath 
and ran to the gap in the tum- 
bled rock about the archway, 
and squeezed his way into the 
area of subsidiary vaults. 

Without the pump in opera- 
tion, the air could not circulate 
to this point, but he hoped to 
drag some of his companions 
down to the torn filter and re- 
vive them — then, with their 
help, bring the others. 

It would be all right. They 
would be saved, as planned. He 
regretted the loss of the elders. 
But no matter. They were but 
the rulers. He and the others 
were the chemists, the scientists, 
the engineers. New elderships 
could be created when they had 
become settled again, and could 
rebuild their civilization. 

He went to Zina’s slab first. 
She would not be as much help 
as some of the others, but Zina 
and he were too close for him to 
delay her revival any longer. 
Life was not worth having with- 
out Zina. He carried her out of 
the vault, through the gap and 
thick miasma of corruption, then 
down into the pump chamber. 
Leaving her lying on her back, 
with the breeze ruffling her hair 



THE AWAKENING

about her face, Rik went back 
up for the next person. 

Three exhausting trips later, 
he sat among the bodies of his 
friends, listening with joy to 
their returning quiver of breath 
and life. Zina was the first to 
open her eyes. She seemed star- 
tled to find she was no longer 
on the slab, and then joyous 
when her glance fell upon his 
eager face. 

“We’ve done it!” she sighed. 
‘We came through!” She tried 
to sit up, then lay down heavily. 
“Rik — I’m so weak. .” 

“We need food, all of us,” he 
said. “I’m weak myself.” He 
arose from his crouch at her side 
and stared down the tunnel to 
the outer world. “I don’t know 
what it’s like out there,” he said. 
“There may be no food at all. 
If the War was as devastating 
as predicted, it may be barren 
rock, burning sun and overall 
death.” 

“How long — ?” Zina began, 
and then her eyes fell upon the 
time-rotted hulk of the pump 
and she stopped, her face going 
pale. “As long as that!” she 
whispered. “Oh, Rik! Do you 
think — ?” ^ 

“I’ll know when I’ve looked,” 
he said. Their eyes met for a 
long, silent moment, then he 
turned and started up the tunnel. 

Three hundred strides brought 
him to the barrier, the thinly 



perforated shield of rock that 
had been left intact to hide the 
location of the vaults from their 
enemies. Rik put his shoulder to 
the shell. It cracked and fell 
away as he’d thought it would, 
with weather and erosion having 
weakened it for centuries. Bright 
yellow moonlight lay all about 
the land outside. Incredibly fine 
sand was everywhere, but a smell 
of fresh water and green grow- 
ing things was mingled with the 
night air. The region had not 
been desert when the vaults were 
constructed. The War had left 
its mark of devastation here, Rik 
saw, looking in vain for a trace 
of the magnificent towered city 
that had once been just beyond 
this spot. 

He shook off his dismay and 
set himself to the task for which 
he’d emerged. 

The animals had to be alive, 
yet, or they were doomed. He’d 
always regretted the haste in 
their preparations that had pre- 
cluded preparing survival vaults 
for the food animals. The best 
they’d been able to do, before 
the Day of Devastation, was herd 
the stupid beasts into caves and 
pile the entrances with loose 
rock, hoping the animals would 
dig themselves out only after the 
worst fury of the War had 
passed. Rik threw off the bitter 
memory, abruptly, as his ears de- 
tected a tiny buzz of sound. 



112 



GALAXY 



He dropped to the ground and 
lay still, watching to see what 
sort of beast would appear. It 
sounded larger than the animals 
he remembered. “I must be near 
a waterhole,” he reasoned. 
“There’s a pathway here, made 
by many animals passing this 
way. .” he mused, studying the 
narrow, flattened track that he’d 
spotted in the night-chilled sand. 

Then he saw something com- 
ing slowly up the trail, a thing 
much larger than the animals he 
remembered. 

It was a long moment before 
he realized what it was, and 
smiled. Then he reached out his 
hands and had it. It buzzed loud- 
ly in his grip until he pounded 
it to silence on a rock. By the 
time he’d returned to the pump 
chamber, he’d managed to prise 
it open, but its contents — man- 
gled by the smashing upon the 
rock — were barely fit to eat. 

“It’s better than I could have 



hoped,” he said to Zina, when 
they and the others had picked 
the thing clean. “Life promises 
to be much more exciting, in- 
finitely more sporting in this 
new age outside the vaults. With 
care, we can survive until our 
engineers rig up some whip- 
rays and herding-claws again.” 

“It will be fun,” Zina agreed, 
smiling with grim anticipation. 
“I enjoy a challenge in the hunt. 
Who’d have thought the animals 
would have come so far from the 
caves!” 

Tt was hours later that the bus 
-*■ company grew worried about 
their missing vehicle, and start- 
ed an investigation. But they 
could find no trace of the bus, 
anywhere, and it remained a 
mystery until the day everybody 
suddenly knew what had hap- 
pened. 

But that was far too late.

STAR KING 

Two were human. The third was a 
fearsome alien creature. Gersen 
gambled his life to decide which! 

BY JACK VANCE 



CONCLUSION 



Synopsis 

Gersen was a dedicated man. 

As a child he had seen his family wiped out in the attack of a 
Star King, a human-seeming creature totally without morals or 
compassion. Gersen had been bred and trained ever since for one 
purpose: revenge. After decades of growing and learning he was 
at last on the track of the being who had ravaged his home. The 
trail began on a lonely outpost planet where a desperate space ex- 
plorer, doomed to death, told him of a wonderful virgin world he 
had sighted . and told him that the Star King was intent on 
owning the planet for himself. 

Gersen stole the dying explorer’s coded control filament, which 
would enable him to locate the virgin planet. Tracking down the 



114 




names of the men who had sponsored the explorer, Gersen found 
three persons, Kelle, Detteras and Warweave, all seeming solid 
citizens with a philanthropic interest in space exploration . but 
one of whom was a monster 



Gersen was certain he was on the right track when Sarkoy 
assassins tried to waylay him. Born and bred to kill in a thousand 
ways, they were yet no match tor Gersen, whose whole life had 
been devoted to countermeasures for any such attack. He made 
arrangements to interview the three men, one of whom was his 
enemy, and in the process met a girl, Pallis Atwrode, who touched 
the first human spark Gersen had felt in his whole life. 



There had been no others. 



In training himself to, combat a monster, Gersen discovered 
he had become almost a sort of monster himself.

hereby declare that time shall 
now be reckoned from the year 
2000 A.D. (Old System), which 
becomes the year 0. The revolu-

Tf~ agge Kelle was a small com- 
pact man with a large solid 
well-arranged head. His skin was 
only faintly dyed, to a waxy 
bisque pallor; he wore a severe 
costume of dark brown and pur- 
ple. His eyes were clear and re- 
mote, his nose was short and 
blunt, his mouth prim, held firm- 
ly as if in compensation for its 
over-fullness. 

Kelle seemed to make a virtue 
of inscrutability. He greeted Ger- 
sen with austere courtesy, listen- 
ed to his story without comment, 
saw the photographs without 
perceptible show of interest. 
Choosing his words with care, 
he said, “I am sorry that I can- 
not help you. I did not sponsor 
Mr. Teehalt’s expedition. I know 
nothing about this man.” 

“In that case, will you allow 
me the use of the decoding 
strip?” 

Kelle sat motionless a mo- 
ment. Then he said in an even 
voice, “Unfortunately this is con- 
trary to the rules of the depart- 
ment. I would encounter not a 
little criticism. Still. .” He 
picked up the photographs and 
examined them once more. “This 
is beyond question a world of 
interesting characteristics. What 
is its name?” 

“I don’t have that information, 
Mr. Kelle.” 

“I cannot conceive why you 
seek Teehalt’s sponsor. Are you 



116 



GALAXY 



a representative of the IPCC?” 
“I am a private individual, 
though naturally I can’t demon- 
strate this.” 

Kelle was skeptical. “Every- 
one works to his own interests. 
If I understood what you were 
trying to achieve, I could pos- 
sibly act with more flexibility.” 
“This is more or less what Mr. 
Warweave told me,” said Gersen. 

Kelle turned him a sharp look. 
“Neither Warweave nor myself 
are what might be called inno- 
cent men.” He thought a mo- 
ment, then said grudgingly, “On 
behalf of the department, I can 
go so far as to make you an of- 
fer for the filament — though, 
as you tell the story, it actually 
is the property of the depart- 
ment to begin with.” 

Gersen nodded in full agree- 
ment. “This is exactly the point 
I am trying to establish. Does 
the filament actually belong to 
the university, or can I feel free 
to do as I like with it? If I could 
find Lugo Teehalt’s sponsor — 
or determine whether the spon- 
sor actually exists — then any 
number of new possibilities 
would appear.” 

Kelle was not to be moved by 
Gersen’s ingenuousness. “It is an 
extraordinary situation ... As I 
say, I might be able to make you 
an attractive offer for the fila- 
ment — even as a private party, 
if that would expedite matters. 



Although I would naturally in- 
sist on a prior inspection of the 
planet.” 

“You know my qualms in the 
matter, Mr. Kelle.” 

Kelle’s response was only a 
small incredulous smile. Once 
more he studied the photographs. 
“These — er — dryads, I must 
say they are creatures of con- 
siderable interest. Well, I can 
help you to this extent. I will 
consult university records for in- 
formation regarding Lugo Tee- 
halt. But in exchange, I would 
like you to assure me an oppor- 
tunity to consider the purchase 
of this world, in the event that 
you don’t find the ‘sponsor’.” 
Gersen could not restrain a 
mild gibe. “You gave me to un- 
derstand that you weren’t parti- 
cularly interested.” 

“Your assumptions are of no 
consequence,” said Kelle evenly. 
“This should not injure your 
sensibilities, for you clearly are 
not concerned as to my opinion 
of you. You approach me as if 
I were mentally deficient, with 
a tale which would not impress 
a child.” 

Gersen shrugged. “The tale is 
substantially accurate. Naturally 
I haven’t told you everything.” 

K elle smiled again, rather 
more generously. “Well, let’s 
see what the records have to tell.” 
He spoke into the microphone.

The non-human voice of the 
information bank responded. 
“Confidential Information, 

ready.” 

“The file on Lugo Teehalt.” 
He spelled out the name. 

There was a series of subdued 
mutterings, a quiet eery whis- 
tling. The voice spoke once 
more, reading off the informa- 
tion it had gathered. “Lugo Tee- 
halt: his file. Contents: applica- 
tion for admission, verification 
and appended comment. April 3, 
1480.” 

“Pass,” said Kelle. 

“Application for admission to 
advanced regimen, verification 
and appended comment. July 2, 
1485.” 

“Pass.” 

“Thesis for degree in College 
of Symbology: title: ‘The Mean- 
ingful Elements in the Eye-Mo- 
tion of the Tunkers of Mizar 
Six’. December 20, 1489.” 

“Pass.” 

“Application for post as asso- 
ciate instructor, verification and 
comment. March 15, 1490.” 

“Pass.” 

“Discharge of Lugo Teehalt, 
associate instructor, for conduct 
which appeared predjudicial to 
morale of student corpus. Octob- 
er 19, 1492.” 

“Pass.” 

“Contract between Lugo Tee- 
halt and Department of Galactic 
Morphology, January 6, 1521.” 



Gersen exhaled a small sigh, 
at the reduction of tension of 
whose existence he had barely 
been aware. It was definite: 
Lugo Teehalt had been employ- 
ed as locater by someone within 
the department. 

“Quote in resume,” Kelle or- 
dered. 

“Lugo Teehalt and Depart- 
ment of Galactic Morphology 
agree and covenant to the fol- 
lowing. Department will furnish 
Teehalt a suitable space-vessel, 
provisioned, equipped, found in 
typical and useful manner, in 
order that Teehalt shall conduct, 
as agent of Department, assidu- 
ous exploration of certain areas, 
of galaxy. Department advances 
Teehalt sum of five thousand 
SVU and guarantees a bonus of 
graduated values for degrees of 
successful exploration. Teehalt 
agrees to devote best efforts to 
successful pursuit of explora- 
tion, to preserve results of said 
exploration secure and secret 
from all persons, groups, and 
agencies other than those author- 
ized by Department. Signatures: 
Lugo Teehalt for Lugo Teehalt; 
Ominah Bazerman for Depart- 
ment. 

“No further information.” 

“Mmf,” said Kagge Kelle. He 
spoke to the screen. “Ominah 
Bazerman.” 

A click, a voice spoke. “Omin- 
ah Bazerman, Chief Clerk.”

“Kelle speaking. Two years 
ago a certain Lugo Teehalt was 
despatched as a locater. You 
signed his contract. Do you re- 
member the circumstances?” 

There was a moment’s silence. 
“No, Mr. Kelle, I can’t say that 
I do. The contract probably 
came to me in a set of other 
papers.” 

“You don’t remember who 
would have initiated this con- 
tract, who sponsored this parti- 
cular exploration?” 

“No, sir. It must have been 
either yourself or Mr. Detteras. 
Or perhaps Mr. Warweave. No 
one else would order out such an 
exploration.” 

“I see. Thank you.” Kelle turn- 
ed to Gersen, his eyes mild, al- 
most bovine. “And there you 
have it. If it wasn’t Warweave, 
it must be Detteras. As a matter 
of fact Detteras is former Dean 
of the College of Symbology. 
Perhaps he and Teehalt were ac- 
quaintances. 

ID undle Detteras, Director of 
Exploration, seemed a man 
completely at his ease — at peace 
with himself, his job, the world 
at large. When Gersen entered 
his office he held up his hand 
in easy salute. 

Detteras was a large man, sur- 
prisingly ugly for this age when 
a pointed nose or an over-loose 
mouth could be repaired in a 



matter of hours. He made no at- 
tempt to camouflage his ugliness. 
Indeed, it seemed as if his rather 
harsh blue-green skin-dye, al- 
most the color of verdigris, ac- 
centuated the coarseness of his 
features, the rather gauche 
brusqueness of his motions. His 
head was the shape of a gourd. 
The heavy chin rested on his 
breast with no perceptible inter- 
vention of neck; the hair was a 
bristle dyed the color of wet 
moss. From knee to shoulder he 
seemed of uniform thickness,- 
with a torso like a log. He wore 
the quasi-military uniform of a 
Baron of the Order of Arch- 
angels: black boots, loose scarlet 
breeches, a splendid blouse 
striped green, blue and scarlet, 
with gold epaulettes and fili- 
greed breast plates. 

Rundle Detteras was of suffi- 
cient presence to command both 
the uniform and his odd physio- 
gnomy. A man with the slightest 
dubiety or self-consciousness 
would instantly have seemed ec- 
centric. 

“Well, well, Mr. Gersen,” said 
Detteras, “is it too early for a 
taste of arrack?” 

“I’m out of bed.” 

Detteras stared in brief puzzle- 
ment, then laughed heartily. 
“Excellent! This is when I usu- 
ally hoist the hospitality flag. 
Tint, tang, or white?” 

“White, please.” 



THE STAR KING

Detteras poured from the tall 
slender flask. He raised his glass: 
“Detteras au pouvoir!" He drank 
with gusto. “First of the day, like 
a visit home to mother.” He 
poured himself a second tot, set- 
tled back, turned upon Gersen 
a glance of leisurely appraisal. 

Gersen asked himself, which 
one? Warweave? Kelle? Detter- 
as? One of these exteriors hid 
the ferocious soul of Grendel the 
Monster. Warweave? Kelle? 
Detteras? Gersen had inclined 
toward Warweave; now he was 
once more dubious. Detteras had 
undeniable force, a rude harsh- 
textured energy that was almost 
palpable. 

Detteras apparently felt no 
urgency about coming to grips 
with Gersen’s business, for all 
the reputed press of his affairs. 
It was not unlikely that he and 
Warweave had been in com- 
munication, and possibly Kelle 
likewise. “A never-ending puz- 
zle,” said Detteras, rather pomp- 
ously. “The modes of why and 
how men differ.” 

If Detteras were in no hurry 
thought Gersen, neither was he. 
“No doubt you’re right,” he said, 
“although I don’t understand the 
immediate relevance.” 

Detteras laughed, a heavy 
booming sound. “Quite as it 
Should be. I would be surprised 
if you professed otherwise.” He 
held up his hand to forestall 



Gersen’s response. “Presumption 
on my part? No. Hear me out. 
You are a somber and pragma- 
tic man. You carry a heavy load 
of secrets and dark resolves.” 

Gersen sipped suspiciously at 
the arrack. The verbal pyrotech- 
nics might be intended as a dis- 
traction, a device to diminish 
his wariness. He concentrated on 
the arrack, senses keen for the 
faintest off-flavor. Detteras had 
poured both drinks from the 
same flask, he had offered Ger- 
sen a choice of three distillations, 
he had taken up glasses without 
seeming calculation. There exist- 
ed, nonetheless, enormous scope 
for ruse, which no normal vigi- 
lance could prevent. But the 
drink was innocent, so Gersen’s 
tongue and nasal passages, train- 
ed on Sarkovy, assured him. 

He focused his attention upon 
Detteras and the previous re- 
mark. “Your opinions regarding 
me are exaggerated.” 

T'Vetteras grinned, a great gap- 
lipped grimace. “But never- 
theless essentially accurate?” 

“Possibly.” 

Detteras nodded complacent- 
ly, as if Gersen had given him 
the most emphatic of corrobora- 
tions. “It is a skill, or habit of 
observation, bom of long years 
of study. I formerly specialized 
in Symbology, until I decided 
that I’d cropped the pasture as 



120 



GALAXY 



short as my teeth were long, and 
as far as my tether would reach. 
So here I am in Galactic Mor- 
phology. A less complicated 
field, descriptive rather than an- 
alytic, objective rather than hu- 
manistic. Still, I occasionally 
find application for my previous 
field. Now is a case in point. You 
come into my office, an utter 
stranger. I assess your overt sym- 
bolic presentation: skin color; 
shape, condition, color of your 
hair; features, clothes, your gen- 
eral style. You will say this is 
common practice. I reply, true. 
Everyone eats, but a skilled tast- 
er is rare. I read these symbols 
with minute exactitude, and they 
provide me with information 
about your personality. I, on the 
other hand, deny similar knowl- 
edge to you. How? I bedizen my- 
self with random and contradic- 
tory symbols, I am in constant 
camouflage, behind which the 
real Rundle Detteras watches, as 
calm and cool as an impresario 
at the hundredth performance of 
a glittering carnival extravagan- 
za.” 

Gersen smiled. “My nature 
might be as flamboyant as your 
symbols, and I might dissemble 
it for reasons similar to your 
own — whatever they are. A sec- 
ond point: your presentation, if 
it can be believed, illuminated 
you almost as clearly as the set 
of your natural symbols. Third 



— why bother in the first place?” 
Detteras seemed much amused. 
“Aha! You show me for the 
fraud and charlatan I am! Still, 
I cannot avoid the conviction 
that your symbols tell me more 
about you than mine do about 
me.” 

Gersen leaned back in his seat. 
“To little practical effect.” 

“Not so fast,” exclaimed Det- 
teras. “You occupy yourself ex- 
clusively with positivity! Con- 
sider negativity for a moment. 
Some people fret regarding the 
cryptic mannerisms of their col- 
leagues. You protest that the 
symbols tell you nothing of im- 
portance; you dismiss them. 
These others worry because they 
cannot integrate a proliferation 
of information.” Gersen started 
to demur; Detteras held up his 
hand. “Consider the Tunkers of 
Mizar Six. You are acquainted 
with them? A religious sect.” 

“I heard them mentioned a 
few minutes ago.” 

“As I say,” Detteras continued, 
“they are a religious group. As- 
cetic, austere, devout to an as- 
tonishing extreme. The men and 
women dress identically, shave 
their heads, use a language of 
eight hundred and twelve words, 
eat identical meals at identical 
hours — all this to protect them- 
selves from the perplexity of 
wondering about each other’s 
motivations. True. This is the 



THE STAR KING 



121 



basic purpose of the Tunker 
mode. And not too far from Miz- 
ar is Sirene, where for a similar 
reason men wear highly conven- 
tionalized masks, from birth to 
death. Their face is their dearest 
secret.” He proffered the arrack 
flask. Gersen held out his glass. 

Detteras continued. “The prac- 
tice here on Alphanor is more 
complicated. We gird ourselves 
for offense and defense, or sheer 
playfulness, with a thousand am- 
biguous symbols. The business of 
living is enormously compli- 
cated. Artificial tensions are es- 
tablished. Uncertainty and sus- 
picion become normality.” 

“And in the process,” suggest- 
ed Gersen, “sensitivities are de- 
veloped unknown to either the 
Tunkers or the Sirenese.” 

etteras held up his hand. 
“Again, not so fast. I know 
a great deal about both these 
peoples. Insensitivity is a word 
which cannot be applied to ei- 
ther. The Sirenese will detect the 
most remote nuance of uneasi- 
ness when a man masks himself 
above his status. And the Tunk- 
ers — I know less of them, but 
I believe that their personal dif- 
ferentiations are as refined and 
varied as our own, if not more 
so. I quote an analogous esthetic 
doctrine : the tighter the disci- 
pline of an art-form, the more 
subjective the criteria of taste. 



Consider the Star Kings — non- 
men driven by their psyches to 
literally superhuman excel- 
lences. They must enter the field 
cold, as it were, without even 
the human racial unconscious 
as a matrix for their symbolic 
education. Returning to Alpha- 
nor, it must be remembered that 
the folk thrust an enormous 
amount of perfectly valid infor- 
mation at each other, as well as 
ambiguities.” 

“Confusing,” said Gersen dry- 
ly, “if one allows himself to be 
distracted.” 

Detteras laughed quietly, evi- 
dently well pleased with himself. 
“You’ve led a different life than 
I have, Mr. Gersen. On Alpha- 
nor the issues aren’t life and 
death; everyone is fairly sophis- 
ticated. It’s easier than not to 
accept people at their own valua- 
tion. Indeed it’s often impracti- 
cal not to do so.” He looked side- 
long at Gersen. “Why do you 
smile?” 

“It dawns upon me that the 
dossier on Kirth Gersen, re- 
quested from the IPCC, is slow 
in arriving. In the meantime, 
you find it impractical to accept 
me at my own valuation. Or 
even your own.” 

Detteras laughed in his turn. 
“You do both me and the IPCC 
an injustice. The dossier came 
promptly, several minutes before 
your arrival.” He pointed to a 




122 



GALAXY 



photostat sheet on his desk. “I 
ordered the dossier, incidentally, 
in my role as a responsible of- 
ficer of the institution. I think 
my caution was proper.” 

“What did you learn?” asked 
Gersen. “I haven’t seen the dos- 
sier recently.” 

“It’s marvellously blank.” He 
picked up the paper. “You were 
born in 1490. Where? Not on one 
of the major worlds. At the age 
of 10, you registered into Galileo 
Space Port on Earth, in the 
company of your grandfather, 
whose antecedents perhaps we 
should likewise check. You at- 
tended the usual schools, were 
accepted by the Institute as cate- 
chumen, reached the eleventh 
phase at the age of twenty-four. 
Quite respectable progress. Then 
you withdrew. From now on 
there is no record, suggesting 
that either you remained perma- 
nently on Earth, or departed il- 
legally, without registration. 
Since you now sit before me, 
the latter seems to have been the 
case. Remarkable,” said Detter- 
as, “that a person could live to 
your age in a society as complex 
as the Oikumene with so little 
official record! Long years of 
silence while you were occupied 
where? How? To what purpose 
and to what effect?” He glanced 
questioningly at Gersen. 

“If it’s not there,” said Gersen, 
“I don’t want it there.” 



“Naturally . There is very 
little more.” He tossed down the 
dossier. “Now you are anxious 
to make your inquiries. I will 
anticipate you. I knew Lugo Tee- 
halt, far back indeed, in my un- 
dergraduate days. He involved 
himself in some sort of unsavory 
mess, and dropped from sight. A 
year or so ago he came to me, 
asking for a locater’s contract.” 

G ersen stared at him fasci- 
nated. So here was Grendel! 
“And you sent him out?” 

“I chose not to do so. I did 
not want him dependent upon 
me for the rest of his life. I was 
willing to help him, but not on a 
personal basis. I told him to ap- 
ply either to the Honorary Pro- 
vost Gyle Warweave, or the 
Chairman of the Research Plan- 
ning Committee Kagge Kelle; to 
mention my name, that very like- 
ly they could assist him. This 
was the last I heard of him.” 
Gersen took a deep breath. 
Detteras spoke with the assur- 
ance of truth. But which of them 
had not? Detteras at least had 
confirmed that one of the three 
— either himself, Warweave or 
Kelle — was lying. 

Which? 

Today he had seen Grendel, 
looked into his eyes, listened to 
his voice. 

He was suddenly uneasy. Why 
was Detteras so relaxed? Pre- 



THE STAR KING 



123 



sumably a busy man, how could 
he spare so much time? Gersen 
sat abruptly up in his chair. “I 
will get to the point of my call 
upon you.” He told the story he 
had already related to Warweave 
and Kelle while Detteras listen- 
ed with a faint smile playing 
over his coarse mouth. Gersen 
displayed the photographs and 
Detteras looked at them negli- 
gently. 

“A beautiful world,” said Det- 
teras. “If I were wealthy I would 
ask you to sell it to me for my 
personal estate. However, I am 
not wealthy. To the contrary. In 
any event, you seem not so much 
anxious to sell your rights to this 
wprld as to locate poor old Tee- 
halt’s sponsor.” 

Gersen was somewhat taken 
aback. “I’ll sell to the sponsor 
for a reasonable price.” 

Detteras smiled skeptically. 
“Sorry. I can’t admit to a false- 
hood. Warweave or Kelle is your 
man.” 

“They deny it.” 

“Strange. So then?” 

“The filament is useless to me 
in its present condition. Will 
you furnish me the decoding 
strip?” 

“I’m afraid that’s out of the 
question.” 

“I thought as much. So I must 
sell to one or the other of you, 
or to the university. Or destroy 
the filament.” 



“Hm.” Detteras judiciously 
nodded his head. “This demands 
careful thought. If your demands 
were not excessive, I’d be inter- 
ested. Or perhaps the three of 
us, in concert, could come to 
some agreement with you. Hm. 
Let me speak to Warweave and 
Kelle. And then, if you could, 
come back tomorrow, say at ten. 
I might have a definite proposi- 
tion to put before you.” 

Gersen rose to his feet. “Very 
well. Tomorrow at ten.” 

VIII 

■\7"es, we are a reactionary, se- 
cretive, pessimistic, organiza- 
tion. We have agents every- 
where. We know a thousand 
tricks to discourage research, 
sabotage experiments, distort 
data. Even in the Institute’s own 
laboratories we proceed with 
deliberation and discretion. 

But now let me answer some 
of the questions and accusations 
we often hear. Do the members 
of the Institute enjoy wealth, 
privilege, power, freedom from 
the law? Honesty compels the 
answer: yes, in varying degree, 
depending upon phase, achieve- 
ment. 

Then the Institute is an in- 
bred, restricted, centripetal 
group? By no means. We con- 
sider ourselves an intellectual 
elite, certainly. Why should we 



124 



GALAXY 



not? Membership is open to any- 
one, although few of our cate- 
chumens achieve even so far as 
the fifth phase. 

Our policy? Simple enough. 
Space-drive has given a terrible 
weapon to any megalomaniacs 
who happen to occur in our 
midst. There is other knowledge 
which, if equally free, could en- 
sure them tyrannical power. We 
therefore control the dissemina- 
tion of knowledge. 

We are scathed as “self-anoint- 
ed divinities”; we are accused of 
pedantry, conspiracy, condescen- 
sion; smugness, arrogance, ob- 
stinate self-righteousness. These 
are the mildest of the objurga- 
tions we hear. We are accused 
of intolerable paternalism, and 
in the same breath reproached 
for disengagement from ordi- 
nary human affairs. Why do we 
not use our lore to lighten toil, 
alleviate pain, prolong life? Why 
do we stand aloof? Why do we 
not transform the human estate 
into a Utopia, a task well within 
our power? 

The answer is simple — per- 
haps deceptively so. We feel 
these are false boons; that peace 
and satiety are akin to death. 
For all its rawness and cruel ex- 
cess we envy archaic humanity 
its ardent experience. We hold 
that gain after toil, triumph af- 
ter adversity, achievement to a 
goal long-sought, is a greater 

THE STAR KING 



beneficence than prebendary 
nutrient from the teat of an in- 
dulgent government. 

— From the television ad- 
dress by Madian Carbuke, 
Centennial (Hundredth 
Phase Fellow) of the Insti- 
tute, December 2, 1502. 

Conversation between two 
Centennials of the Institute, 
in connection with a third 
not present: 

“I would gladly come to your 
house for a chat, if I did not sus- 
pect that Ramus were likewise 
invited.” 

“But what is so wrong with 
Ramus? He often amuses me.” 
“He is a fungus, a flatulence, 
a pompous old toad, and he irri- 
tates the hell out of me.” 

Question occasionally put 
to Fellows of the Institute: 
Are Star Kings included 
among the fellowship? 

The customary answer: We 
certainly hope not. 

Motto of the Institute: A little 
knowledge is a dangerous thing; 
a great deal of knowledge is dis- 
aster, which detractors of the In- 
stitute scornfully paraphrase to: 
Somebody else’s ignorance is 
bliss. 

P allis Atwrode lived with two 
other girls in a seaside apart- 

125 



ment tower to the south of Remo. 
Gersen waited in the lobby while 
she ran up to change clothes and 
re-tint her skin. 

He went out on the deck over- 
looking the ocean, leaned against 
the rail. Great blazing Rigel 
hung low over the ocean, laying 
a molten road from shore to hori- 
zon. Near at hand in the harbor, 
enclosed by twin piers, a hun- 
dred boats were moored: power 
yachts, sailing catamarans, glass- 
hulled submarines, a shoal of 
jet-powered aquaplanes, to be 
ridden at maniacal speed over, 
through and across the waves. 

Gersen’s mood was complex. 
It puzzled even himself. There 
was the heart-bumping anticipa- 
tion of an evening with a pretty 
girl, a sensation he had not 
known for years. There was the 
melancholy normally induced by 
sunset — and now the sunset was 
beautiful indeed; the sky glowed 
mauve and green-blue, around a 
great bank of persimmon-orange 
clouds stranded with magenta. 
It was not the beauty which 
brought on melancholy, mused 
Gersen, but rather the quiet 
halcyon light and its fading. 

. And there was another melan- 
choly — different yet somehow 
similar — which came to Gersen 
as he watched the debonair folk 
about him. They were all grace- 
ful and easy, untouched by the 
toil and pain and terror that 



existed on remote worlds. Ger- 
sen envied them their detach- 
ment, their social skills. 

Still, would he change places 
with any of them? He would 
not. 

Pallis Atwrode came to join 
him by the rail. She had tinted 
herself a beautiful soft olive- 
green, with a subtle patina of 
gold; she now wore her hair in a 
loose dark curly cap. She laugh- 
ed at Gersen’s obvious approval. 
“I feel like a wharf-rat,” said 
Gersen. “I should have changed 
into new clothes.” 

“Please don’t worry,” she said. 
“It’s completely unimportant. 
Now. What shall we do?” 

“You’ll have to make sugges- 
tions.” 

“Very well. Let’s go into 
Avente and sit on the esplanade. 
I never tire of watching people 
walk past. Then we can decide 
what’s next.” 

G ersen acceded; they walked 
to the slide-car and drove 
north, Pallis chattering with in- 
genuous candor about herself, 
her job, her opinions, plans and 
hopes. 

She was, so Gersen learned, a 
native of Singhal Island, on the 
planet Ys. Her parents were 
prosperous, owning the only 
cold-storage warehouse of the 
Lantango Peninsula. When they 
retired to the Palmetto Islands, 



126 



GALAXY 



her oldest brother took control 
of the warehouse and likewise 
the family home. The brother 
next older had wished to marry 
her, this form of union being 
countenanced on Ys, which had 
been settled originally by a 
group of Reformed Rationalists. 
But the brother was stout, red- 
faced, arrogant, without a trade 
other than driving the ware- 
house van, and the prospect held 
no charm for Pallis. 

At this point Pallis hesistated 
and her candor seemed to slip 
gears, for she changed the sub- 
ject. Gersen guessed at the dra- 
matic confrontations, fierce re- 
proaches and countering accusa- 
tions which had taken place. 
Pallis had now lived in Avente 
for two years, and though some- 
times homesick for the sights 
and sounds of Ys, she felt her- 
self happy and lucky. Gersen 
was charmed by her talk. He 
had never known anyone so art- 
less. 

They parked the slider, walk- 
ed out along the esplanade, se- 
lected a table in front of one of 
the numerous cafes and sat 
watching the crowds stroll by. 
Beyond spread the dark ocean, 
with the sky now plum and in- 
digo-gray, with only the faintest 
tinge of lemon to mark the 
passage of Rigel. 

The night was warm, folk 
from all the worlds of the Oiku- 



mene sauntered past. The waiter 
brought goblets of punch. Ger- 
sen sipped, his tensions began to 
relax. Neither spoke for a peri- 
od; then Pallis suddenly turned 
to face him. 

“You’re so silent. So guarded. 
It is because you’re in from Be- 
yond?” 

Gersen had no ready reply. 
Finally he gave a rueful laugh. 
“I hoped you’d think me easy 

and suave, like everyone else ” 

“Oh, come now,” said Pallis 
teasingly. “Nobody’s like every- 
one else.” 

“I’m not altogether sure,” said 
Gersen. “I suppose it’s a matter 
of relativity: how near you are. 
Even bacteria have individuality, 
if they’re examined closely 
enough.” 

“So now I’m a bacterium,” 
said Pallis. 

“Well, I’m another, and I’m 
probably boring you.” 

“No, no! Of course noi! I’m 
enjoying myself.” 

"So am I. Too much. It’s — 
enervating.” 

Pallis scented a compliment. 
“How do you mean?” 

“I can’t allow myself the lux- 
ury of emotional commitments 
— even if I should like to.” 

* “You’re much, much, much 
too sober for a young man.” 
“I’m not young any more.” 
She made a gay gesture. “But 
you admit you’re sober!” 



THE STAR KING 



127 



“I suppose so. But be careful, 
don’t push me too far.” 

“A woman likes to think her- 
self a temptress.” 

A gain Gersen had no response. 
■**-He studied Pallis across the 
table. For the moment she seem- 
ed content to watch the passers- 
by. What a warm-hearted gay 
creature, he thought, without a 
trace of malice or acerbity. 

Pallis turned her attention 
back to him. “You’re really such 
a quiet man,” she told him. 
“Everyone else I know refuses 
to stop talking, and I listen to 
continual floods of nonsense. 
I’m sure you know hundreds of 
interesting things, and you re- 
fuse to tell me any of them.” 

' Gersen grinned. “They’re 
pfobably less interesting than 
you think.” 

“Still, I’d like to make sure. 
So tell me about the Beyond. Is 
life really so dangerous?” 

“Sometimes yes, sometimes no. 
It depended on whom you meet, 
arid why.” 

“But — perhaps you’d rather I 
didn’t ask — what do you do? 
You’re not a pirate or a slaver?” 
• “Do I look like a pirate? Or 
a slaver?” 

“You know that I don’t know 
what a pirate or a slaver looks 
like! But I’m curious. Are you 
a — well, criminal? Not that it’s 
necessarily a disgrace,” she add- 

128 



ed hastily. “Affairs which are 
perfectly acceptable on one plan- 
et are absolutely taboo on an- 
other. For instance, I told one of 
my friends that all my life I’d 
expected to marry my oldest 
brother — and her hair uncurl- 
ed!” 

“I’m sorry to disappoint you,” 
said Gersen, “but I’m not a 
criminal. I don’t fit into any 
category.” He considered. There 
could be no indiscretion in tell- 
ing her what he had told War- 
weave, Kelle and Detteras. “I’ve 
come to Avente for a particular 
purpose, naturally — ” 

“Let’s have dinner,” said Pal- 
lis, “and you can tell me while 
we eat.” 

“Where shall we go?” 

“There’s an exciting new res- 
taurant, only just opened. Every- 
one’s talking about it and I’ve 
never been there.” She jumped 
to her feet, took his hand with 
an easy intimacy, pulled him up- 
right. He caught her under the 
arms, bent forward, but his dar- 
ing waned; he laughed and re- 
leased her. She said archly, 
“You’re more impulsive than 
you look.” 

Gersen grinned, half shame- 
facedly. “Well, where is the ex- 
citing new restaurant?” 

“Not far. We can walk. It’s 
rather expensive, but I -plan to 
pay half the account.” 

“That’s not necessary,” said 

GALAXY 



Gersen. “Money is no particular 
problem to a pirate. If I run 
short, I’ll rob someone. You per- 
haps. .” 

“It’s hardly worth the trouble. 
. Come along then.” She took 
his hand, and they walked north 
along the esplanade like any of 
the thousand other couples 
abroad this fine Alphanor eve- 
ning. 

Ohe led him to a kiosk circled 
^ by large luminous green letters 
reading: NAUTILUS. An esca- 
lator dropped them two hundred 
feet into a tall octagonal lobby 
paneled with rattan screens. A 
major domo escorted them along 
a glass-vaulted tunnel, out upon 
the floor of the sea. Dining 
rooms of various sizes opened off 
the passage, into one of which 
they were conducted. They took 
a table close beside the sloping 
glass dome. The sea lay beyond, 
with beacons illuminating the 
sand, rocks, seaweed, coral, the 
passing submarine creatures. 

“Now,” said Pallis, leaning 
forward, “tell me about the Be- 
yond. And don’t worry about 
alarming me, because I love an 
occasional shudder.” 

“Smade’s Tavern on Smade’s 
Planet is a good place to start,” 
said Gersen. “You’ve been 
there?” 

“Of course not. But I’ve heard 
it mentioned.” 



“It’s a small, barely habitable 
planet out in the middle of no- 
where. All mountains. Wind, 
thunderstorms, an ocean black 
as ink. The tavern is the only 
building on the planet. Some- 
times it’s crowded, sometimes 
there’ll be no one but Smade and 
his family for weeks on end. 
When I arrived the only other 
guest was a Star King.” 

“A Star King? I thought they 
were always disguised as men.” 

“It’s not a matter of disguise,” 
said Gersen. “They are men. Al- 
most.” 

“I never have understood 
about the Star Kings. Just what 
are they?” 

Gersen shrugged. “You’ll get a 
different answer every time you 
ask. The general speculation goes 
like this. A million years ago, 
more or less, the planet Lambda 
Grus III, or ‘Ghnarumen’ — you 
have to cough through your nose 
to get it even approximately 
right — was inhabited by a rath- 
er frightening assortment of crea- 
tures. Among them was a small 
amphibious biped without any 
particular tools for survival ex- 
cept awareness and an ability to 
hide in the mud. He probably 
looked a little like a lizard, or 
a hairless seal . The species 
faced extinction half a dozen 
times, but a few always managed 
to hang on, and somehow scav- 
enge an existence among crea- 



THE STAR KING 



129 



tures who were more savage, 
more cunning, more agile, better 
swimmers, better climbers, even 
better scavengers than them- 
selves. The proto-Star Kings had 
only psychical advantages. Self- 
consciousness. Competitiveness. 
A desire to stay alive by any 
means whatever.” 

“They sound rather like the 
proto-humans on ancient Earth,” 
said Pallis. 

“No one knows for sure. At 
least no men. What the Star 
Kings know they’re not telling. 
These bipeds differed from 
proto-man in several respects. 
They were biologically much 
more flexible, able to transmit 
acquired characteristics. Second- 
ly, they are not bisexual. There 
is cross-fertilization by means of 
spores emitted on the breath, but 
each individual is male and fe- 
male at once, and the young de- 
velop as pods in the armpits. Per- 
haps from this lack of sexual dif- 
ferentiation the Star Kings have 
no natural physical vanity. 
Their basic drive is the urge to 
out-do, to out-function, to out- 
survive. The biological flexibil- 
ity coupled to a rudimentary in- 
telligence provided the means to 
implement their ambitions; they 
consciously began to breed them- 
selves into a creature which 
could out-perform as many of 
their less resourceful competitors 
as possible. 



Ophis is all speculation, of 
course, and what follows is 
speculation on an even more 
tenuous basis. But just let’s as- 
sume that some race able to tra- 
verse space visited Earth. It 
might have been the people 
which left ruins on the Fomal- 
haut planets, or the Hexadelts, 
or whoever carved Monument 
Cliff on Xi Puppis X. 

“We assume that such a space- 
traveling people came by Earth 
a hundred thousand years ago. 
Assume that they captured a 
tribe of Mousterian Neander- 
thals, and for some reason con- 
veyed them to Ghnarumen, the 
world of the proto-Star Kings. 
Here is a challenging situation 
for both parties. The men are 
far more dangerous opponents to 
the Star Kings than the now-de- 
feated natural enemies. The men 
are intelligent, patient, crafty, 
ruthless, aggressive. Under pres- 
sure of the environment the men 
themselves evolve into a differ- 
ent type: more agile, faster of 
body and mind than their Nean- 
derthal predecessors. 

“The proto-Star Kings suffer 
setbacks, but they have their he- 
reditary patience as well as im- 
portant weapons : the competi- 
tive urge, the biological flexibil- 
ity. Men have proved superior 
to themselves. To compete with 
men they shape themselves into 
human semblance. 



130 



GALAXY 



“Their war continues . and 
the Star Kings admit, very guard- 
edly, that certain of their myths 
describe these wars. 

“Another assumption now be- 
comes necessary. About fifty 
thousand years ago the space 
travelers return and convey the 
evolved Earthmen back to Earth. 
And perhaps a few Star Kings 
— who knows? And so the Cro- 
Magnons appear in Europe. 

“On their own planet the Star 
Kings are at last more man-like 
than men. They prevail. The 
true men are destroyed. The Star 
Kings are supreme and remain 
so until five hundred years ago, 
when the men of Earth discover 
the intersplit. When they chance 
upon ‘Ghnarumen’ they are as- 
tonished to find creatures ex- 
actly resembling themselves: the 
Star Kings.” 

“It sounds far-fetched,” said 
Pallis dubiously. 

“Not as far-fetched as conver- 
gent evolution. It is a fact that 
Star Kings exist: a race not an- 
tagonistic, but not friendly ei- 
ther. Men are not allowed to visit 
Ghnarumen. They tell us only 
as much about themselves as 
they care to, and they send ob- 
servers — spies, if you like — 
everywhere throughout the 
Oikumene. There are probably a 
dozen Star Kings in Avente.” 

Pallis grimaced. “How can 
you tell them from men?” 



“Sometimes even a doctor 
can’t, after they finish disguising 
and faking themselves. There are 
differences, of course. They have 
no genital organs; their pubic 
region is blank. Their proto- 
plasm, blood, hormones have a 
different composition. Their 
breath has a distinctive odor. 
But the spies, or whatever they 
are, are altered, so that even an 
x-ray shows the same as that of 
a man.” 

“How did you know the — the 
creature at Smade’s Tavern was 
a Star King?” 

“Smade told me.” 

“How did Smade know?” 
Gersen shook his head. “I 
never thought to ask.” 

T T e sat silent, preoccupied with 
a new notion. 

There had been three guests at 
Smade’s Tavern: himself, Tee- 
halt, and the Star King. If Tris- 
tano were to be believed — and 
why not? — he had arrived in 
company only with Dasce and 
Suthiro. If Dasce’s statement to 
Teehalt were to be credited, 
Grendel must be reckoned Tee- 
halt’s murderer. Gersen had cer- 
tainly heard Teehalt’s scream, 
while Suthiro, Dasce and Tris- 
tano stood within his range of 
vision. 

Unless Smade were Grendel, 
unless another ship had surrep- 
titiously arrived — unlikely 



THE STAR KING 



131 



events — then Grendel and the 
Star King must be one. Think- 
ing back, Gersen recalled that 
the Star King had left the din- 
ing hall in ample time to allow 
a conference outside with Dasce. 

Pallis Atwrode lightly touched 
his cheek. “You were telling me 
of Smade’s Tavern.” 

“Yes,” said Gersen. “So I was.” 
He looked at her speculatively. 
She must certainly know a great 
deal about the comings and go- 
ings of Warweave, Kelle and 
Detteras. Pallis, misunderstand- 
ing the nature of his gaze, flush- 
ed prettily under her pale-green 
skin-toning. Gersen laughed un- 
easily. “Back to Smade’s Tav- 
ern.” He described the events of 
the evening. 

Pallis listened with interest, 
almost forgetting to eat. “So 
now you have Lugo Teehalfs 
filament and the university has 
the decoder.” 

“Correct, and neither one val- 
uable without the other.” 

They finished dinner. Gersen, 
with no credit account on Al- 
phanor, paid the bill in cash, 
and they returned to the surface. 
“Now what would you like?” 

“I don’t care,” said Pallis. 
“Let’s go back along the esplan- 
ade to our table, for a while any- 
way.” 

The night was now dark: the 
moonless black-velvet night of 
Alphanor. The facade of every 



building at the back of the espla- 
nade glowed faintly, blue or 
green or pink; the pavement 
gav° off a silver effulgence; the 
balustrade emitted a pleasant, 
almost unseen amber-beige radi- 
ance; everywhere was soft shad- 
owless light, rich with muted 
ghost-color. Up in the dark sky 
stars floated, big, vague, pale. 

A v'-v’—r brought coffee and 
liqueur and they settled back to 
watch the passing crowds. 

Pallis said in a reflective voice, 
“You’re not telling me every- 
thing.” 

“Of course not,” said Gersen. 
“In fact. Gersen paused, grap- 
pling with a disturbing new 
thought. Grendel might mistake 
the nature of his interest in Pal- 
lis — especially if Grendel were 
a Star King, sexless, unable to 
understand the male-female re- 
lationship. “In fact,” said Ger- 
sen in a bleak voice, “I really 
have no right involving you in 
my troubles.” 

“I don’t feel involved,” said 
Pallis, stretching her arms lazily. 
“And if I were, what of it? This 
is Avente on Alphanor, a civi- 
lized planet.” 

Gersen gave a sardonic 
chuckle. “I told you that others 
were interested in this planet. 
Well — these others are pirates 
and slavers as depraved as you 
could want. Have you ever heard 
of Grendel?” 



132 



GALAXY 



“Grendel the Monster? Yes.” 
Gersen resisted the temptation 
of telling her that she took mes- 
sages and ran errands daily for 
Grendel. “It’s almost certain,” he 
said, “that stick-tights are watch- 
ing us. Now. This very minute. 
And the other end of the circuit 
is possibly Grendel himself.” 
Pallis moved uneasily, scanned 
the sky. “Don’t you mean that 
Grendel is watching me? That’s 
a creepy feeling.” 

Gersen looked to right, to left, 
stared. Two tables away sat Su- 
thiro, the Sarkoy venefice. 



A Teeting Gersen’s eye, Suthiro 
nodded politely, smiled. He 
rose to his feet, sauntered to the 
table. 

“Good evening, Mr. Gersen.” 
“Good evening,” said Gersen. 
“May I join you?” 

“I’d prefer not.” 

Suthiro laughed softly, seated 
himself and inclined his fox face 
toward Pallis. “And this young 
lady, do you plan to introduce 
me?” 

“You already know who she 
is.” 



“But she does not know me.” 
Gersen turned to Pallis. “Here 
you see Scop Suthiro, Master 
Venefice of Sarkovy. You ex- 
pressed an interest in evil men? 
Here you have as completely 
evil a man as you’re likely to 
meet.” 



Suthiro laughed in easy glee. 
“Mr. Gersen judiciously uses the 
word ‘likely’. Certain of my 
friends surpass me as grandly as 
I surpass you. I hope indeed that 
you do not meet them. Hildemar 
Dasce, for instance, who boasts 
of his ability to paralyze dogs 
with a glance.” 

Pallis’ voice was troubled. “I’d 
just as soon not meet him.” She 
stared at Suthiro in fascination. 
“You really — admit that you’re 
evil?” 

Suthiro laughed once more, a 
subtle muffled sound. “I am a 
man. I am a Sarkoy.” 

Gersen said, “I’ve just been 
describing our encounter at 
Smade’s Tavern to Miss Atwrode. 
Tell me something. Who killed 
Lugo Teehalt?” 

Suthiro seemed surprised. 
“Who else but Grendel? We 
three sat within. Does it make 
any difference? It might as easi- 
ly have been myself or Beauty 
or Tristano. Tristano, by the 
way, is quite ill. He suffered a 
dreadful accident, but hopes to 
see you on his recovery.” 

“He can consider himself 
lucky,” said Gersen. 

“He is ashamed,” said Suthiro. 
“He thinks himself skillful. I 
have told him he is not so skill- 
ful as I.” 

“Speaking of skill,” said Ger- 
sen, “can you do the paper 
trick?” 



THE STAR KING 



133 



Suthiro cocked his head side- 
wise. “Yes, of course. Where did 
you learn of the paper trick?” 

“At Kalvaing.” 

“And what wrought you at 
Kalvaing?” 

“A visit with Coudirou the 
venefice.” 

Suthiro pursed his heavy red 
lips. He wore a yellow skin-tone; 
his brown pelt was glossy and 
smooth with oil. “Coudirou is as 
wise as any. As for the paper 
trick. .” Gersen handed him a 
napkin. Suthiro suspended it 
from left thumb and forefinger, 
stroked it lightly with his right 
hand. It fell to the table in five 
ribbons. 

CC'V^T’ell done,” said Gersen, 
and to Pallis: “His finger- 
nails are hardened, sharp as ra- 
zors. Naturally he would waste 
no poison on the paper, but each 
of his fingers is like the head of 
a serpent.” 

Suthiro made complacent ac- 
quiescence. 

Gersen turned back to him. 
“Where is Fancy Dasce?” 

“Not too far distant.” 

“Red face and all?” 

•Suthiro shook his head sadly, 
at Dasce’s poor taste in skin- 
toning. “A very able and very 
strange man. Have you ever won- 
dered about his face?” 

“When I could bear to look 
at it.” 



“You are not my friend. You 
tricked me beautifully. Never- 
theless I will warn you : never 
cross Fancy Dasce. Twenty years 
ago he was thwarted in some 
small escapade. It was a matter 
of collecting money from an 
obstinate man. Hildemar by 
chance found himself at a disad- 
vantage. He was knocked down 
and strapped hand and foot. So 
now his creditor had the poor 
taste to cleave poor Hildemar’s 
nose, and cut off his eyelids. 
Hildemar eventually escaped 
and now is known as Beauty 
Dasce, or Fancy Dasce.” 

“How awful,” muttered Pallis. 

“Exactly.” Suthiro’s voice be- 
came contemptuous. “A year lat- 
er Hildemar allowed himself the 
luxury of capturing this man. He 
conveyed him to a private place, 
where he lives to this day. And 
occasionally Hildemar, remem- 
bering the outrage which cost 
him his features, returns to this 
private place to remonstrate with 
the man.” 

Pallis turned glazed eyes at 
Gersen. “These people are your 
friends?” 

“No. We are associated only 
through Lugo Teehalt.” Suthiro 
was looking along the esplanade. 
Gersen asked idly, “You and 
Dasce and Tristano work togeth- 
er and train together as a team?” 

“Often, though I for one pre- 
fer a singular scope.” 



134 



GALAXY 



“And Lugo Teehalt had the 
misfortune to blunder upon you 
at Brinktown?” 

“He died quickly. Godogma 
takes all men. Is this misfor- 
tune?” 

“One never likes to hasten 
Godogma.” 

“True.” Suthiro inspected his 
strong agile hands. “Agreed.” He 
looked toward Pallis. “On Sar- 
kovy we have a thousand popu- 
lar aphorisms to this effect.” 
“Who is Godogma?” 

“The Great God of Destiny, 
who carries a flower and a flail, 
and walks on wheels.” 

Gersen put on an air of studi- 
ous concentration. “I will ask 
you a question. You need not an- 
swer. In fact, perhaps you do not 
know; but I am puzzled. Why 
should Grendel, a Star King, so 
vehemently desire this particu- 
lar world?” 

S uthiro shrugged. “This is a 
matter with which I have 
never concerned myself. Appar- 
ently the world is valuable. I am 
paid. I kill only when I must or 
when it profits me — so you 
see,” he told Pallis parentheti- 
cally, “I am not really so evil a 
man, am I now? Presently I will 
return to Sarkovy and live out 
my days roaming the Gorobun- 
dur Steppe. Ah, now! There is 
the life! When I think of those 
times to come, I wonder why I 



sit here now, beside this odious 
wetness.” He grimaced toward 
the sea and rose to his feet. “It 
is a presumption to advise you, 
but why not be sensible? You 
can never defeat Grendel. There- 
fore relinquish the filament.” 
Gersen thought a moment, 
then said, “I will also presume, 
in the same spirit which prompts 
you. My advice is this: kill Hil- 
demar Dasce the next moment 
you see him, or even before.” 
Suthiro knit his furry brown 
eyebrows in puzzlement, glanced 
for the most fleeting instant up- 
ward. 

Gersen continued. “There is a 
stick-tight watching us, although 
I have not located it. Its micro- 
phone probably registers our 
conversation. Until you told me, 
I had no idea that the Star King 
at Smade’s Tavern was Grendel. 
I am interested. I do not think 
this is common knowledge.” 
“Quiet!” hissed Suthiro, eyes 
blazing with sudden red wrath. 

Gersen lowered his voice. 
“Hildemar Dasce quite possibly 
will be asked to punish you. If 
you wish to forestall Godogma, 
if you wish to take your wagon 
across Gorobundur Steppe — kill 
Dasce and go.” 

Suthiro hissed something be- 
low his breath, jerked up his 
hand as if to throw, then backed 
away, turned, melted into the 
crowd. 



THE STAR KING 



135 



Pallis relaxed, slumped into 
her chair. In an uncertain voice 
she said, “I’m not as adventur- 
ous as I supposed myself.” 

“I’m sorry,” said Gersen genu- 
inely contrite. “I should never 
have asked you out.” 

“No, no. I just can’t accustom 
myself to that kind of talk, here 
on the esplanade, in peaceful 
Avente. But I suppose I’m actual- 
ly enjoying it. If you’re not a 
criminal, who or what are you?” 
“Kirth Gersen.” 

“You must work for the 
IPCC.” 

“No.” 

“Then you must be on the In- 
stitute’s Special Committee.” 
“I’m just Kirth Gersen.” He 
rose to his feet. “Let’s walk for 
a bit.” 

They went north along the es- 
planade. To the left lay dark 
sea; to the right the edifices 
glowing in various soft colors; 
and beyond, the skyline of 
Avente: luminous spires against 
the black Alphanor night. 

Pallis presently took Gersen’s 
arm. “Tell me, what if Grendel 
is a Star King? What does that 
mean?” 

“I’ve been wondering myself.” 
Indeed, Gersen had been trying 
to remember the look of the 
Star King. Had it been War- 
weave? Kelle? Or Detteras? The 
lusterless black skin-tone had 
blurred the features; the striped 



coif had covered the hair. Ger- 
sen had an impression that the 
Star King had been taller than 
Kelle, but not quite so tall as 
Warweave. But would even the 
black skin-tone have camou- 
flaged Detteras’s rude rough fea- 
tures? 

Pallis was speaking: “Will 

they really kill that man?” 
Gersen glanced up to see if 
he could locate the stick-tight, 
without success. “I don’t know. 
He’s useful. Incidentally — ” Ger- 
sen hesitated, wondering anew 
as to the ethics of involving Pal- 
lis in the sordid affair. 
“Incidentally what?” 
“Nothing.” For fear of the 
stick-tight’s microphone Gersen 
dare not inquire as to the move- 
ments of Kelle, Detteras and 
Warweave; Grendel so far had 
no reason to suspect his interest. 
Pallis said in an injured voice, 
“I still don’t understand how 
all of this affects you.” 

/^Ance more Gersen chose to be 
discreet. The stick-t i g h t 
might hear; Pallis Atwrode her- 
self might be an agent of Gren- 
del’s though Gersen considered 
this unlikely. So he said, “Not at 
all — except in the abstract.” 
“But any of these people — ” 
she nodded to the passersby — 
“they might be Star Kings. How 
could we separate them from 
men?” 



136 



GALAXY 



“It’s hard. On their home plan- 
et — I won’t attempt to pro- 
nounce it again — they come in 
many approximations to man. 
Those who travel the known 
worlds as observers — spies, if 
you prefer, although I can’t 
imagine what they hope to leam 
— they’re almost exact facsim- 
iles of true men.” 

Pallis suddenly seemed sub- 
dued. She opened her mouth to 
speak, then closed it again, and 
finally gave a gay fling of her 
hands. “Let’s forget about them. 
Nightmares. You have me seeing 
Star Kings everywhere. Even at 
the university. .” 

Gersen looked down into her 
upturned face. “Do you know 
what I’d like to do?” 

She smiled provocatively. “No. 
What?” 

“First I’d like to shake off the 
stick-tight, which is no great 
problem. And then. .” 

“And then?” 

“I’d like to go somewhere 
quiet, where we could be alone.” 
She looked away. “I don’t 
mind. There’s a place down the 
coast. Les Sirenes, it’s called. 
I’ve never been there.” She 
laughed in embarrassment. “But 
I’ve heard people talking.” 
Gersen took her arm. “First 
to shake off the stick-tight. .” 
Pallis entered into the maneu- 
vers with child-like abandon. 
Looking into the merry face, 



Gersen wondered about his re- 
solve to avoid emotional involve- 
ments. If they went to Les 
Sirenes, if the night brought 
them to closer intimacy, what 
then? Gersen thrust aside his 
qualms. He would cope with 
problems as they arose. 

The stick-tight, if it had ex- 
isted, was confounded and lost; 
they returned to the parking 
area. There was little light; the 
ranked round shapes glimmered 
with silky dull highlights. 

They came to the slide-car; 
Gersen hesitated, then put his 
arms around the swaying girl, 
kissed her upturned face. 

Behind him was the loom of 
movement; ahead a furtive shift- 
ing. Gersen turned, in time to 
look into a horrid blood-red 
face with poisonous blue cheeks. 
Hildemar Dasce’s arm descend- 
ed. 

A great weight curled over 
Gersen’s head; lightning explod- 
ed inside his skull. He tottered 
and fell to his knees. Dasce lean- 
ed over him. Gersen tried to 
dodge. The world reeled and 
toppled; he saw Suthiro grin- 
ning like a sick hyena, with his 
hand to the girl’s neck. Dasce 
struck again, and the world went 
dim. 

Gersen had time for an instant 
of bitter self-reproach, before 
another thunderous buffet ex- 
tinguished his consciousness. 



THE STAR KING 



137 



IX 

Excerpt from When is a 
Man Not a Man, by Podd 
Hachinsky, article in Cos- 
mopolis, June, 1500: 

... As men have traveled from 
star to star they have encounter- 
ed many forms of life, intelligent 
and non-intelligent (to empha- 
size a perfectly arbitrary and 
possibly anthropomorphic para- 
meter). No more than half a 
dozen of these life forms merit 
the adjective “humanoid”. Of 
these half dozen, a single species 
closely resembles man: the Star 
Kings of Ghnarumen. 

Ever since our initial astound- 
ed contact with the race, the 
question has recurred: are they 
of the family of man — the “bi- 
furcate, bibrachiate, monoceph- 
aloid, polygamite”, as Tallier 
Chantron waggishly puts it — or 
are they not? The answer, of 
course, depends on definitions. 

One point can instantly be 
settled. The Star Kings are not 
homo sapiens. But if what is 
meant is a creature which can 
talk a human language, walk in- 
to a haberdashery and dress him- 
self off a rack, play an excel- 
lent game of tennis, or fight a 
bout of chess, attend the. regal 
functions of Stockholm or the 
lawn fetes of Strylvania without 
occasioning a lift of autocratic 
eyebrow — then they are men. 



Man or not man, the typical 
Star King is a courteous, even- 
tempered fellow, even if suspi- 
cious and humorless. Do him a 
favor, he will thank you, but feel 
no obligation ; injure him, he 
will explode in tigerish fury and 
kill you — if he is in a situation 
where human law cannot re- 
strain him. If such action will 
cause legal trouble, he will in- 
stantly dismiss the injury and 
hold no grudge. He is ruthless 
but not cruel, and is puzzled by 
such perverse human manifesta- 
tions as sadism, masochism, re- 
ligious fervor, flagellation, sui- 
cide. On the other hand he will 
demonstrate a whole battery of 
peculiar habits and attitudes no 
less inexplicable from our point 
of view, arising from the twists 
and quirks of his own psyche. 

To say that his origin is in 
dispute is like a remark to the 
effect that Croesus was well-off. 
At least a dozen theories to ex- 
plain the remarkable similarity 
between Star King and Man ex- 
ist. None are completely con- 
vincing. If the Star Kings them- 
selves know, they will admit 
nothing. Since they bar all an- 
thropological and archaeologi- 
cal research teams from their 
planet, we are afforded neither 
verification - nor refutation of 
any of these theories. 

On human planets they punc- 
tiliously model their conduct af- 



138 



GALAXY 



ter the best human examples, but 
their innate behaviour patterns 
are unique to the race. Perhaps 
to oversimplify, one can say that 
their dominant trait is a passion 
to excel, to outdo a competitor 
at his own game. Since man is 
the dominant creature of the 
Oikumene, the Star Kings accept 
him as the champion to be chal- 
lenged and outdone. So they 
strive to outdo man in every as- 
pect of the human capacity. If 
this ambition (at which they are 
often successful) seems unreal 
and artificial to us, no less so 
does our sexual drive seem to 
them; for the Star Kings are 
parthenogenetic, reproducing in 
a manner which is beyond the 
scope of this article to describe. 
Knowing nothing of vanity, set- 
ting no store by either beauty 
or ugliness, they strive for phys- 
ical perfection only to score 
points in their semi-amicable 
contest with true men. 

What of their achievements? 
They are fine builders, daring 
engineers, excellent technicians. 
They are a pragmatic race, and 
not particularly apt at mathe- 
matics or the speculative sci- 
ences. It is hard to conceive of 
their giving birth to a Jarnell, 
who discovered the space-split- 
ter by sheer accident. Their cities 
are impressive sights, rising 
from the flatlands like a growth 
of metallic crystals. Each adult 



Star King builds for himself a 
spire or tower. The more fervent 
his ambition and more exalted 
his rank, the higher and more 
splendid his tower (which he 
seems to enjoy only as a monu- 
ment). Upon his demise the 
tower may be temporarily oc- 
cupied by some junior individ- 
ual during the period in which 
he accumulates sufficient wealth 
to build his own tower. Inspira- 
tional as the cities seem from a 
distance, they lack the most ob- 
vious municipal utilities, and 
the areas between the towers are 
unpaved, dusty, littered. Fac- 
tories, industrial plants and the 
like are housed in low utilitarian 
domes and manned by the least 
aggressive and least evolved of 
the species — for the race is by 
no means homogeneous. It is as 
if every human gathering in- 
cluded Proconsuls, Pithecan- 
thropi, sinanthropus giganticus, 
Neanderthals, Magdalenians, 
Solutreans, Grimaldi, Cro-Mag- 
non, and all the races of Modem 
Man. 

\ t midnight a group of young 
-**-folk came laughing and sing- 
ing into the parking area. They 
had dined with unaccustomed 
amplitude at The Halls. They 
had visited Llanfelfair, Lost 
Star Inn, Haluce, the Casino 
Plageale. They were intoxicated, 
but as much by exuberance as 



140 



GALAXY 



by the wines, smokes, perfusions, 
subliminal whirligigs, chants, 
voltes and other exaltments pur- 
veyed by the houses which they 
had visited. The youth who stum- 
bled over Gersen’s body uttered 
first a jocular malediction, then 
an exclamation of shocked con- 
cern. 

The group gathered. One ran 
to his vehicle and pressed the 
emergency call-button; two min- 
utes later a police craft dropped 
down from the sky, and then an 
ambulance. 

Gersen was conveyed to a hos- 
pital where he was treated for 
concussion and shock with ap- 
propriate irradiation, massage, 
and vitalizing medicines. He 
presently returned to conscious- 
ness, and for a moment lay 
thinking. Then he gave a sudden 
lurch and tried to rise from the 
bed. The attending interns cau- 
tioned him, but Gersen, paying 
no heed, struggled erect and 
stood swaying. “My clothes!” he 
croaked. “Give me my clothes!” 

“They’re safe in the closet, 
sir. Relax, recline, if you please. 
Here is the police officer to take 
your evidence.” 

Gersen lay back fretfully. The 
police investigator approached : 
a keen-faced young man wearing 
the yellow-brown jacket and 
black breeches of the Sea Pro- 
vince Constabulary. He address- 
ed himself to Gersen politely, 



seated himself and opened the 
flap of the recorder lens. 

“Now, sir, what happened?” 
“I was out for the evening 
with a young woman, Miss Pal- 
lis Atwrode of Remo. When we 
came back to the car, I was 
slugged, and I don’t know what 
happened to Miss Atwrode. The 
last thing I remember she was 
struggling to escape from one of 
the men.” 

“There were how many?” 
“Two. I recognized them. 
Their names are Hildemar Dasce 
and a man I know only as Su- 
thiro, a Sarkoy. Both are notori- 
ous men Beyond.” 

“I see. The young lady’s name 
and address?” 

“Pallis Atwrode, Merioneth 
Apartments, Remo.” 

“We’ll check at once to make 
sure she hasn’t arrived home. 
Now, Mr. Gersen, let’s go over 
this again.” 

In a dull voice Gersen gave a 
detailed account of the attack, 
described Hildemar Dasce and 
Suthiro. As he spoke, a report 
came in from Constabulary Con- 
trol. Pallis Atwrode had not re- 
turned to her apartment. Roads, 
airways and space-terminals were 
under observation. The IPCC 
had been called into the case. 
“Now, sir,” said the investiga- 
tor in a neutral voice, “may I 
inquire your business?” 



THE STAR KING 



141 



“I am a locater.” 

“What is the nature of your 
association with these two men?” 
“None. I saw them at work 
once before, on Smade’s Planet. 
Apparently they regard me as 
an enemy. I believe that they are 
part of Grendel the Monster’s or- 
ganization.” 

“Very strange that they should 
commit an actionable offense so 
brazenly. In fact, why did they 
not kill you?” 

“I don’t know.” Gersen once 
more staggered to his feet. The 
investigator watched with profes- 
sional attentiveness. “What are 
your plans, Mr. Gersen?” 

“I want to find Pallis At- 
wrode.” 

“Understandable, sir. But it is 
best that you do not interfere. 
The police are more effective 
than a single man. We should 
have news for you at any time.” 
“I don’t think so,” said Ger- 
sen. “By now they’re in space.” 
The investigator, rising to his 
feet, made tacit admission that 
such was the case. “We will na- 
turally keep you informed.” He 
bowed and departed. 

Gersen immediately dressed, 
with the disapproving help of an 
orderly. His knees were weak. 
His hand floated in a kind of 
generalized all-embracing pain. 
There was a faint singing in his 
ears from the drugs. 

An elevator dropped him di- 



rectly to a subway station. Ger- 
sen stood on an exchange plat- 
form, straining to formulate a 
coherent plan of action. A 
phrase kept repeating itself com- 
pulsively, like an inch-worm 
traversing the inner surface of 
his skull: Poor Pallis, poor Pal- 
lis. 

With no better plan in mind 
he stepped into a capsule and 
sent himself to a station under 
the Esplanade. He emerged, but 
instead of going to the car, took 
a seat in a brasserie and drank 
coffee. “By now she’s in space,” 
he told himself once more. “And 
it’s my fault. My fault.” Because 
he should have foreseen this sort 
of outcome. Pallis Atwrode knew 
Warweave, Kelle and Detteras 
well; she saw them daily, heard 
whatever gossip there was to be 
heard. Grendel the Star King, 
Grendel the Monster, was one of 
three men, and Pallis Atwrode 
evidently had knowledge which, 
coupled to Suthiro’s indiscre- 
tions, made Grendel’s incognito 
insecure. Hence she must be re- 
moved. Killed? Sold into slav- 
ery? Taken by Dasce for his per- 
sonal use? . Poor Pallis, poor 
Pallis. 

G ersen looked out over the 
'ocean. A rim of lavender was 
forming at the horizon, presag- 
ing dawn. The stars were fading. 
“I’ve got to face up to it,” Ger- 



142 



GALAXY 



sen told himself. “It’s my respon- 
sibility. If she is harmed — but 
no. Ill kill Hildemar Dasce in 
any event.” Suthiro, treacherous, 
fox-faced Suthiro, was already as 
good as dead. And there was 
Grendel himself, the architect of 
the entire evil construction. As 
a Star King he somehow seemed 
less hateful: a dire beast, which 
might be expunged without emo- 
tion. 

Surfeited with hate and grief 
and misery, he went to the car 
in the now empty parking area. 
There, the spot where Dasce had 
stood. There, where he had lain 
unconscious — what a wretched, 
careless fool! How the spirit of 
his grandfather must writhe in 
shame! 

He started the car, returned 
to his hotel. There were no mes- 
sages. 

Dawn had come to Avente. 
Rigel threw wide horizontal fans 
of light between the distant Cati- 
line Hills and a darkling bank 
of clouds. Gersen set the alarm 
dial, dosed himself with a two- 
hour soporific, threw himself 
down on the bed. 

He awoke to gloom and de- 
pression even more intense than 
before. Time had passed; what- 
ever had been in store for Pallis 
Atwrode was now fact. Gersen 
ordered coffee; he could not 
bring himself to eat. 

He considered what he must 



do. The IPCC? He would be 
forced to tell everything he 
knew. Could the IPCC act more 
efficiently if he laid his infor- 
mation before them? He could 
tell them that he suspected an 
administrator of the Sea Pro- 
vince University to be one of the 
so-called Demon Princes. What 
then? The IPCC, an elite police 
force, with the vices and virtues 
characteristic of such an organi- 
zation, might or might not be 
trustworthy. Star Kings had pos- 
sibly infiltrated the group; in 
this case Grendel would certain- 
ly be warned. And how could the 
information help rescue Pallis 
Atwrode? Hildemar Dasce was 
the kidnapper. Gersen had re- 
ported this, and no information 
could be more explicit. 

Another possibility: the ex- 
change of Teehalt’s world for 
Pallis Atwrode. 

Gersen would gladly accept 
the trade — but whom to trade 
with? He still could not identify 
Grendel. The IPCC no doubt 
would have means to detect him. 
Then what? The exchange would 
no longer be conceivable. There 
might be a quiet execution — 
though the IPCC generally act- 
ed only upon the formal request 
of some authorized government- 
al agency. And in the meantime, 
what of Pallis Atwrode? She 
would be lost — a small delight- 
ful spark of life, forgotten 



THE STAR KING 



143 



But if Gersen knew Grendel’s 
identity he would have vastly 
more leverage. He could make 
his offer with assurance. The 
logic of the situation seemed to 
be that Gersen proceed as before. 
But how slow! Think of Pallis, 
poor Pallis! . 

Nevertheless, Hildemar Dasce 
had gone Beyond, and no effort 
of Gersen or of the IPCC could 
avail against this hard fact. 
Grendel alone had the power to 
order his return. If Pallis At- 
wrode still lived. 

The situation had not 
changed. As before his first ur- 
gency was to identify Grendel. 
Then bargain — or extort. 

With his course of action once 
more clear, Gersen’s spirits lift- 
ed. More accurately, his resolve 
and dedication burned at a fer- 
vent new heat. Hate gave him a 
heady, almost drunken, sense of 
omnipotence. No one, nothing, 
could withstand emotion so in- 
tense! 

The hour of his appointment 
with Detteras, Warweave and 
Kelle was approaching. Gersen 
dressed, descended to the garage, 
slid his car out upon the avenue 
and headed south. 

A rriving at the university, he 
-Sparked, rode the slide-way to 
the mall, crossed the quadrangle 
to the College of Galactic Mor- 
phology. Hoping against hope, 



with sudden quick jerking of the 
heart, he looked toward the re- 
ception desk. A different girl 
was on duty. He asked politely, 
“Where is Miss Atwrode this 
morning?” 

“I don’t know, sir. She hasn’t 
arrived. Perhaps she’s not feel- 
ing well.” 

Perhaps indeed, thought Ger- 
sen. He mentioned his appoint- 
ment and proceeded to the office 
of Rundel Detteras. 

Warweave and Kelle were 
there before him. The three un- 
doubtedly had reached a deci- 
sion on a common course of ac- 
tion. Gersen looked from face 
to face, Detteras to Warweave to 
Kelle. One of these creatures was 
human only in appearance. At 
Smade’s Tavern he had glimpsed 
him. He tried to think back, to 
visualize, to remember. No im- 
age came. Black-dyed skin and 
exotic costume were a disguise 
beyond his penetration. Furtive- 
ly he assessed each. Which? 
Warweave: aquiline, cold-eyed, 
arrogant? Kelle: precise, humor - 
-less, austere? Or Detteras, whose 
geniality now seemed insincere 
and counterfeit? 

He could not decide. He 
forced himself into a pose of 
studious courtesy, and made his 
primary gambit. “Let’s simplify 
the whole matter,” said Gersen. 
“I’ll buy the decoding-strip. I 
imagine the college could use a 



144 



GALAXY 



thousand SVU. In any event, 
that's the offer I wish to make.” 
His adversaries, each in his 
own style, seemed taken aback. 
Warweave raised his brows, 
Kelle stared fixedly, Detteras 
put on a puzzled half-smile. 

Warweave said, “But we un- 
derstood that you intended to 
sell what you conceived to be 
your interest in this matter.” 

“I don’t mind selling,” said 
Gersen. “if you’ll offer me 
enough.” 

“And how much is enough?” 
“A million SVU, perhaps two, 
or perhaps three, if you’ll go 
that high.” 

Kelle snorted, Detteras shook 
his big ugly head. 

“Fees of that sort are not paid 
to locaters,” said Warweave. 

“Has it been established which 
of you sent out Teehalt?” asked 
Gersen. 

“What does it matter?” asked 
Warweave. “Your interest in the 
affair — money — has become 
clear enough.” He looked from 
Kelle to Detteras. “Whoever it 
is has either forgotten or does 
not care to disclose himself. 
Doubtless that is the way the 
situation will remain.” 

Detteras said, “It’s certainly 
inconsequential. Come now, Mr. 
Gersen, we have decided to make 
you a joint offer — certainly not 
as grandiose as the figure you 
name — ” 



“How much?” 

“Possibly as much as 5000 
SVU.” 

“Ridiculous. This is an excep- 
tional world.” 

“You do not know this,” War- 
weave pointed out. “You have 
not been there, or so you claim.” 
“More to the point,” said Kelle 
dryly, “neither have we.” 

“You have seen the photo- 
graphs,” said Gersen. 

“Exactly,” said Kelle. “We 
have seen no more. Photographs 
can be faked without difficulty. 
I for one do not propose to pay 
out a large sum on the strength 
of three photographs.” 

“Understandable,” said Ger- 
sen. “But for my part I don’t in- 
tend to make a move without a 
guarantee. Don’t forget I have 
suffered a loss. This is my op- 
portunity to make it good.” 
“Be reasonable!” Detteras 
urged bluffly. “Without the de- 
coder, the filament is just an- 
other spool of wire.” 

“Not completely. Fourier an- 
alysis eventually can break the 
code.” 

“In theory. It is a long ex- 
pensive process.” 

“Not as expensive as giving 
the filament away for next to 
nothing.” 

'The discussion continued an 
hour, Gersen gritting his teeth 
in impatience. A price of 100,- 



THE STAR KING 



145 



000 SVU, to be deposited in es- 
crow, was eventually arranged, 
the sale conditional upon a list 
of provisos relating to the phys- 
ical characteristics of the world 
in question. 

Agreement having been reach- 
ed, telescreen contact with the 
Bureau of Deeds and Contracts 
at Avente was made. The four 
men identified themselves form- 
ally and the contract was read 
into the records. 

A second call, to the Bank of 
Alphanor, established the es- 
crow account. 

The three administrators now 
sat back and inspected Gersen, 
who in his turn looked from one 
to the other. “So much is settled. 
Which of you goes with me to 
inspect this world?” 

The three exchanged glances. 
“I’ll gladly go,” said Warweave. 

“I was about to volunteer my 
own services,” said Detteras. 

“In that case,” said Kelle, “I 
might as well come along too. 
I’m overdue for a change.” 

Gersen seethed in frustration. 
He had expected Grendel to vol- 
unteer his services — in fact, to 
assert them — whereupon Ger- 
sen could then take him aside, 
and offer a new deal: the fila- 
ment for Pallis Atwrode. What, 
after all, was the world to him? 
His single goal was Grendel’s 
identity . and after that, his 
life. 



But now this plan had good 
by the boards. If all three went 
out to Teehalt’s planet, the iden- 
tification of Grendel must de- 
pend upon new circumstances. 
Meanwhile the fate of Pallis At- 
wrode bore no thinking about. 

Gersen made a last-ditch pro- 
test. “My boat is small for four. 
Better if only one went out with 
me. 

Detteras threw his hands into 
the air, turned to the screen, 
called his seeretary. “Cancel all 
my appointments. Urgent busi- 
ness is taking me out of town. 
We’ll take the departmental 
ship.” 

"D etuming to Avente, Gersen 
pondered the future. What 
challenges would he face from 
these men, one of whom was 
Grendel? It would be foolhardy 
not to arrange safeguards: this 
was the training imposed upon 
him by his grandfather, a meth- 
odical man, who had labored dil- 
igently to discipline Gersen’s in- 
nate tendency to rely upon im- 
provisation. 

At the hotel Gersen examined 
his belongings, made certain se- 
lections, then packed and check- 
ed out. After painstaking precau- 
tions against stick-tights and hu- 
man trackers, he went to a 
branch office of the Amalga- 
mated Distribution Service, an- 
other of the monster semi-public 



146 



GALAXY 



utility companies with agencies 
throughout the Oikumene. In a 
booth he consulted catalogues 
which offered him a choice of a 
million products produced by 
thousands of fabricators. Mak- 
ing his choice, he punched the 
requisite buttons, went to the 
service counter. 

There was a wait of three min- 
utes, while automatic machinery 
ranged the shelves of the enor- 
mous underground warehouse, 
then the mechanism Gersen had 
ordered appeared on a belt. He 
examined it, paid the clerk, de- 
parted and rode the subway to 
the space-port. He inquired the 
location of the university ship 
from an attendant, who took him 
out on a terrace and pointed 
down the long line of space- 
craft, large and small, each in 
its bay. “Notice, sir, the red and 
yellow yacht with side plat- 
form? Well, count down three. 
First the CD 16, then the old 
Parabola, and then a green and 
blue ship with the big observa- 
tion dome. That’s the job. She’s 
going out today, eh?” 

“Yes. About seven. How did 
you know?” 

“One of the crew is already 
aboard. I had to let him on.” 

“I see.” Gersen went down to 
the field, walked along the way 
which led past the ranked space- 
craft. From the shadow of the 
ship in the next bay, he inspect- 



ed the university ship. The con- 
tours were distinctive, as was the 
rather elaborate emblem at the 
bow. Recollection stirred at the 
back of his mind. Somewhere be- 
fore he had seen this ship. 
Where? At Smade’s Planet on 
the landing field between moun- 
tains and black ocean. It was the 
ship used by the Star King. 

The shape of a man passed in 
front of one of the observation 
windows. When he moved out of 
sight Gersen crossed the space 
between the two ships. 

Cautiously he tried the outer 
entry port. It eased ajar. He 
stepped into the transition 
chamber, peered through the 
panel into the ship’s main saloon. 
Suthiro the Sarkoy worked at 
an object which he apparently 
had attached to the underside of 
a shelf. 

Tnside Gersen something more 
ferocious than gladness — a 
peculiar exaltation of hate — 
swelled and burst, suffusing his 
entire body. He tried the inner 
portal. It was locked from with- 
in. There was, however, an emer- 
gency disengagement which 
would unlock the door if pres- 
sure were equalized between 
cabin and outer atmosphere. 
Gersen touched the emergency 
switch. There was an audible 
click. Within the ship all was 
silent. Not daring to glance

through the panel, Gersen press- 
ed his ear to the port. Useless: 
no sound could pass through the 
laminated structure. He waited 
a minute, then carefully eased 
himself up to look into the cabin 
once more. 

Suthiro had heard nothing. 
He had gone forward, and now 
appeared to be adjusting the 
padding around a stanchion. His 
heavy flat-skulled head was bent 
forward, lips pursed out. 

Gersen slid back the port, 
stepped into the cabin, a projac 
pointed at the big square buckle 
of Suthiro’s steppe-rider harness. 
“Skop Suthiro,” said Gersen. 
“This is a pleasure for which I 
had not dared hope.” 

Suthiro’s dog-brown eyes open- 
ed and shut; he grinned broad- 
ly. “I was waiting for your ar- 
rival.” 

“Indeed. And why?” 

“I wanted to continue our dis- 
cussion of last night.” 

“We were speaking of Godog- 
ma, the Long-Legged Walker, 
with Wheels on his Feet. Plainly 
he has wheeled across the path 
of your life, and you will never 
drive your wagon over the Goro- 
bundur.” 

. Suthiro became very still, his 
eyes measuring Gersen. 

“What happened to the girl?” 
asked Gersen gently. 

Suthiro considered, then re- 
jected the feasibility of feigning 



innocence. “She was taken by 
Fancy Dasce.” 

“With your connivance. 
Where is she now?” 

Suthiro shrugged. “He had or- 
ders to kill her. Why I don’t 
know. I am told very little. Dasce 
will not kill her until he has the 
full use of her. He is a khet.” 
Suthiro sneered the epithet, a 
metaphor linking Dasce to the 
obscenely fecund Sarkovy mink. 
“He has left Alphanor?” 
“Certainly.” Suthiro seemed 
surprised at Gersen’s naivete. 
“Probably for his little planet.” 
He made a fretful uncomfortable 
motion, which brought him an 
imperceptible four inches closer 
to Gersen. 

“Where is this planet?” 

“Ha! Do you think he would 
tell me? Or anyone else?” 

“In that case — but I must ask 
you to stand back.” 

“Pah,” whispered Suthiro in a 
childish display of petulance. “I 
can poison you any time I 
choose.” 

Gersen allowed a faint smile 
to cross his lips. “I have already 
poisoned you.” 

Suthiro raised his eyebrows. 
“When? You have never closed 
with me.” 

“Last night. I touched you 
when I handed you paper. Look 
at the back of your right hand.” 
Suthiro stared in slow hor- 
ror at the red weal. “Cluthe!” 



148 



GALAXY 



Gersen nodded. “Cluthe.” 
“But — why should you do 
this to me?” 

“You merit such an end.” 

Outhiro launched himself like a 
^ leopard ; the projector in Ger- 
sen’s hand discharged a stalk of 
blue-white energy. Suthiro fell 
to the deck, lay staring up at 
Gersen. “Better plasma than 
cluthe,” he whispered huskily. 

“You’ll die by cluthe,” said 
Gersen. 

Suthiro shook his head. “Not 
while I carry my poisons.” 
“Godogma calls you. So now 
speak truth. Do you hate Hilde- 
mar Dasce?” 

“I hate Dasce indeed.” Suthiro 
seemed surprised, as if there 
were anyone who did not hate 
Dasce. 

“I would kill Dasce.” 

“Most people would do no 
less.” 

“Where is his planet?” 
“Beyond. I know no more.” 
“When are you to see him 
next?” 

“Never. I am dying, and Dasce 
is bound for a deeper hell than 
mine.” 

“If you lived?” 

“Never. I was to return to Sar- 
kovy.” 

“Who knows of this planet?” 
“Grendel. Perhaps.” 

“Is there no one else? Tris- 
tano?” 



“No. Dasce tells little. The 
world is airless.” Suthiro care- 
fully hunched himself together. 
“Already the skin begins to 
itch.” 

“Listen, Suthiro. You hate 
Dasce. Yes? And you hate me, 
for I have poisoned you. Think! 
You, a Sarkoy, poisoned by me, 
and so easily.” 

Suthiro muttered, “I hate you 
indeed.” 

“Tell me how to find Dasce, 
then. One of us must kill the 
other. The death will be your 
doing.” 

Suthiro rocked his furry head 
in desolation. “But I cannot tell 
you what I do not know.” 
“What has he said of his 
world? Does he talk?” 

“He boasts. Dasce is a vile 
braggart. His world is harsh; 
only a man like himself could 
master this world. He lives in 
the crater of a dead volcano.” 
“What of the sun?” 

Suthiro hunched himself to- 
gether. “It is dim. Yes. It must 
be red. They asked Dasce about 
his face. Why had he dyed him- 
self red? To match his sun, said 
Dasce, which was the same color, 
and not much larger.” 

“A red dwarf,” mused Gersen. 
“So it might be.” 

“Think! What else? Which 
direction? Which constellation? 
Which sector?” 

“He says nothing. And now — 

149 



THE STAR KING 



I do not care. I think only of 
Godogma. Go away so that I 
may kill myself decently.” 

Gersen surveyed the huddled 
form without emotion. “What are 
you doing here in the ship?” 

Suthiro looked at his hand 
curiously, then rubbed his chest. 
“I feel it moving.” He examined 
Gersen. “Well, then, since you 
would look on my death, watch.” 
He put hands to his neck, con- 
vulsed his knuckles. The brown 
eyes stared. “In thirty seconds 
now.” 

“Who would know of Dasce’s 
planet? Has he friends?” 

“ ‘Friends’?” Suthiro even in 
his last seconds took occasion to 
sneer. 

“Where does he lodge in 
Avente?” 

“North of Sailmaker Beach. 
In an old hut on Melnoy 
Heights.” 

“Who is Grendel? What is his 
name?” 

Suthiro spoke in a whisper. 
“A Star King has no need for a 
name.” 

“What name does he use on 
Alphano?” 

The thick lips opened and 
closed. Words rattled in the pale 
throat. “You killed me. Should 
Dasce fail, let Grendel kill you.” 
The eyelids jerked, quivered. Su- 
thiro lay back, seemed to stiffen, 
made no further movement and 
lay still. 



ersen looked down at the 
body. He walked around be- 
hind it, studied it. The Sarkoy 
were notoriously treacherous 
and revengeful. With his toe, he 
attempted to turn the body over 
on its face. Quick as the strike of 
a serpent the arm flashed around, 
poison-prongs ready. Gersen 
jerked back; the projac ejected a 
second dazzling line of energy; 
this time Suthiro was dead. 

Gersen searched the corpse. 
In the pouch he found a sum of 
money which he tucked into his 
own wallet. There was a kit of 
poisons, which Gersen examined, 
then, unable to comprehend Su- 
thiro’s cryptic nomenclature, 
discarded; also a device no 
larger than his thumb, intended 
to project crystalline needles of 
poison or virus on a jet of com- 
pressed air. A man could be in- 
fected from a distance of fifty 
feet and know nothing save a 
faint tingle. Suthiro carried a 
projac similar to his own, three 
stilettos and a packet of fruit 
lozenges, undoubtedly lethal. 

Gersen dropped the weapons 
back into Suthiro’s pouch, 
dragged the body to a waste ejec- 
tion locker and crammed it away, 
out of sight. Once in space, the 
touch of a button would dispose 
of Sivij Suthiro the Sarkoy. 
Next he looked to discover what 
Suthiro, while alive, had so earn- 
estly been trying to achieve. 



150 



GALAXY 



Under the shelf he found a 
small toggle-switch controlling 
a set of wires which led to a con- 
cealed relay, which in turn ac- 
tivated the valves on four reser- 
voirs of gas at various secret 
spots around the cabin. Death- 
gas or anesthetic? He detached 
one of the reservoirs and found 
a label printed in the crabbed 
Sarkoy syllabary: Tironvirasko’s 
Instantaneous Narcoleptic; an 
odorless sleep-inducent with 
minimal postreducts. 

It seemed that Grendel, no less 
methodical than Gersen, was tak- 
ing his own precautions. 

Gersen took each of the four 
reservoirs to the entry port, re- 
leased their contents and re- 
placed them where he had found 
them. He left Suthiro’s switch 
in place, but changed its func- 
tion. 

This accomplished, Gersen 
brought out his own device: the 
timer he had purchased at Amal- 
gamated, and a grenade from his 
armament. 

After a moment’s reflection he 
secured it inside the reactor 
housing, where it would do maxi- 
mum damage and yet be conve- 
nient in case of need. 

He glanced at his watch. One 
o’clock. Time was growing short. 
Far too short to accomplish all 
which must be done. He depart- 
ed, locking the ship behind him. 
Returning to the terminal, he 



took the subway for Sailmaker 
Beach. 

At a stand beside the station 
Gersen selected a self-service 
cab — a single-seat scooter, gyro- 
scopically balanced, with a 
transparent canopy. Two SVU in 
the slot gave him possession for 
an hour. Stepping aboard, he 
drove north through the noisy 
streets of Sailmaker Beach. 

r T''he district had a unique fla- 
vor. Avente, a suave cosmo- 
politan city, was almost indistin- 
guishable from fifty other pol- 
ities of the Oikumene. Sailmaker 
Beach resembled no other locale 
in the known universe. The 
buildings were low and thick- 
walled, constructed for the most 
part of crushed coquina con- 
crete, white or color-washed. In 
the blazing light of Rigel even 
pastels seemed intense. For some 
reason lavender and pale blue, 
along with white, were the most 
popular tints. The district was 
home to scores of off-world na- 
tionalities, each forming an en- 
clave with its characteristic food 
shops, restaurants, specialty 
houses. Though widely disparate 
of origin, habit and physiogno- 
my, the inhabitants of the dis- 
trict were uniformly voluble, 
half- suspicious, half-naive, con- 
temptuous of outsiders and 
equally contemptuous of each 
other. They earned their living 



THE STAR KING

from tourists, as domestic serv- 
ants or day laborers, as proprie- 
tors of small shops and craft stu- 
dios, as entertainers or musicians 
in the innumerable taverns, bi- 
stros, bordellos, restaurants. 

At the north rose Melnoy 
Heights. Here the architecture 
changed to tall apartment build- 
ings of almost Gothic elongation, 
each seeming to peer over the 
other’s shoulder, across Sailmak- 
er Beach to the more conven- 
tional districts. In Melnoy 
Heights Hildemar Dasce re- 
putedly had lodgings. As meth- 
odically as shortness of time and 
anxiety allowed, Gersen sought 
information regarding Dasce. 

There was no Hildemar Dasce 
listed in the Melnoy Heights Di- 
rectory — nor had Gersen ex- 
pected to find one. Dasce un- 
doubtedly would desire privacy 
and the pose of normality. 

Gersen began to visit the tav- 
erns, describing the tall man 
with the split nose, the red skin, 
the chalk-blue cheeks. He soon 
encountered folk who had no- 
ticed Dasce, but not until the 
fourth tavern did he find anyone 
who had spoken with him. 

“You must mean Beauty,” said 
the bartender, a stubby orange- 
skinned man, with russet hair ar- 
ranged in fine glossy festoons 
and curls. Gersen stared in fas- 
cination at the chain carved 
from turquoise which looped 



from a hole in his left nostril to 
a hole in the lobe of his left 
ear. “Beauty comes in often to 
drink. A space man he claims 
himself, but as to this I can’t be 
certain. I have often declared 
myself a great lover. All of us 
lie, as much or more than neces- 
sary. ‘What is truth?’ asks Pons 
Pilatus, in the fable, and I an- 
swer: ‘A commodity as cheap as 
air, which we hide as if it were 
as precious as yewl-stone.’ ” 
The bartender was disposed 
to further philosophy. Gersen 
hauled him back to the issue at 
hand. “Where does Beauty Dasce 
house himself?” 

“Up the hill, up back.” The 
bartender made a vague gesture. 
“I can tell you no more, be- 
cause I know no more.” 

Gersen rode his scooter up the 
steep lanes and switchbacks of 
Melnoy Heights. Inquiry at an- 
other tavern, a tiresome series 
of questions at various shops, 
lobbies and street-corners, final- 
ly resulted in explicit directions 
to Dasce’s lodgings. Riding a 
little unpaved road which left 
the area of tall apartments, Ger- 
sen circled a steep rocky hill- 
side, where gangs of children 
scrambled like goats. At the end 
of the road stood an isolated rec- 
tangular cottage, rudely, if sub- 
stantially, constructed. It com- 
manded a magnificent view over 
the ocean; over Sailmaker 



152 



GALAXY 



Beach; the Grand Esplanade, 
dwindling far to the south; and, 
only just perceptible through 
the haze, the apartment towers 
of Remo. 

ersen approached the cottage 

with care, though it exuded 
the indefinable but unmistak- 
able feeling of vacancy. He 
walked around peering through 
the windows, seeing nothing of 
interest. After a quick glance to 
right and left, he broke in the 
sash of an inconspicuous win- 
dow and cautiously, in the event 
that Dasce had set man-traps, 
climbed into the cottage. 

The house was strong with the 
feel of Dasce’s habitancy; a faint- 
ly acrid odor, together with an 
aura more subtle than odor, of 
crudeness, dark pompous magni- 
ficent strength. There were four 
rooms, encompassing the usual 
functions. Gersen made a quick 
general investigation, then con- 
centrated his attention upon the 
parlor. 

The ceiling was scrolled plas- 
ter, painted pale yellow. The 
floor was covered by a carpet of 
greenish-yellow fiber, the walls 
were a checkerboard of maroon 
and dark brown hardwood tiles. 
At the far end Dasce had placed 
a desk and heavy chair. The wall 
over the desk was hung with 
dozens of photographs: Dasce in 
all poses, against every variety 



of background. There was Dasce 
in startling close-up, revealing 
every pore of his skin, the split 
cartilage of his nose, the lidless 
blue eyes. There was Dasce in 
the costume of a Bernal flame- 
fighter — varnished black plates 
and horns and cusps and prongs, 
like a titanic stag beetle. There 
was Dasce in a palanquin of yel- 
low rattan, hung with persim- 
mon silk, borne on the shoul- 
ders of six black-haired maidens. 

The angle of the wall display- 
ed a set of photographs of a man 
who was not Dasce. Apparently 
they had been taken over a pe- 
riod of years. The first showed 
the face of a man thirty years 
old: a sturdy, confident, bulldog 
face, serene, even complacent. 
The face had changed alarming- 
ly in the second of the photo- 
graphs. The cheeks were sunken, 
the eyes started from their sock- 
ets, the nerves at the temples 
showed in an intricate mesh. In 
each succeeding photograph the 
face became ever more haggard... 
Gersen glanced along a row of 
books: pornography of a child- 
ishly obscene nature, weapon 
manuals, an index to Sarkoy 
poisons, a late edition of Hand- 
book to the Planets, an index to 
Dasce’s micro-book library, a 
Star Directory. 

The desk itself was extremely 
handsome: side panels of dark 
wood carved to represent griffins 



THE STAR KING 



153 



and winged serpents in a jungle; 
the surface an exquisite inlay of 
opals polished flat. Gersen 
checked the drawers and pigeon- 
holes. They were barren of in- 
formation — completely empty, 
in fact. Gersen stood back, a tide 
of grim despair rising within 
him. He looked at his watch. In 
four hours he must meet Detter- 
as, Warweave and Kelle at the 
space-port. He stood in the cen- 
ter of the room, carefully scru- 
tinized every article. Somewhere 
must be a link with Dasce’s se- 
cret planet; how to recognize it? 

He went to the book-shelf, 
took down the Star Directory, 
examined the lay of the binding. 
If Dasce’s red dwarf were listed 
he certainly must have located 
it in the directory. If he had 
done so several times, there 
might be a crease, a smear, a dis- 
coloration. No such mark was 
visible. Gersen held the book by 
its two covers, let it hang. A 
third through the book the pages 
separated a hair-breadth. Gersen 
carefully opened the book at 
this spot, looked down the list- 
ing. Each star — and on this 
page there were two hundred — 
wqs described under eleven head- 
ings : index number, constellation 
placement as viewed from Earth, 
star type, planetary informa- 
tion, mass, vector of velocity, 
diameter, density, location co- 
ordinates, remarks. 



Twenty-three red dwarfs were 
listed. Eight of these were dou- 
ble. Eleven hung solitary in 
space, forlorn feeble sparks. 
Four were accompanied by plan- 
ets, eight planets in all. These 
four Gersen scrutinized with 
especial care. Reluctantly he was 
forced to conclude that none of 
these planets could conceivably 
be considered habitable. Five of 
the planets were too hot, one 
was completely awash in liquid 
methane, two were too massive 
to allow human toleration of the 
gravity. Gersen’s mouth drooped 
in disappointment. Nothing. 
Still, the page at one time had 
been earnestly consulted: there 
must be information here which 
Dasce needed or valued. Gersen 
tore the page from the book. 

,_ p , he front door opened; Gersen 
whirled. In the opening stood 
a middle-aged man no larger 
than a boy of ten. His head was 
round. His eyes brimmed with 
curiosity, flicking over Gersen 
and around the room. He had 
large features, long pointed ears, 
a heavy protuberant mouth: a 
Highland Imp from the High- 
lands of Krokinole, one of the 
more specialized races of the 
Concourse. He came forward, 
fearlessly swaggering. “Who are 
you that’s in Mr. Spock’s house? 
Looking through Mr. Spock’s 
things? A burglar, I think.” 



154 



GALAXY 



Gersen replaced the book, and 
the Imp said, “That’s one of his 
precious volumes, that bit of 
stuff. Not likely he wants your 
fingers all over it. I’d better go 
for the constable.” 

“Come back here,” said Ger- 
sen. “Who are you?” 

“I’m the by-your-leave care- 
taker, that’s who I am. Also this 
is my land and my house and 
my freehold. Mr. Spock is the 
man I let to, and why should I 
give every burglar north of 
Swansea leave to pillage and 
loot?” 

“Mr. Spock is a criminal,” 
said Gersen. 

“And if he is, it’s proof then 
that there’s no honor among 
thieves.” 

“I’m no thief,” said Gersen 
mildly. “The IPCC is after your 
tenant, Mr. Spock.” 

The Imp bent his big head for- 
ward. “Be you IPCC? Show me 
your blazer.” 

On the assumption that a Kro- 
kinole Imp would not recognize 
an IPCC blazer when he saw 
one, Gersen displayed a trans- 
parent tablet, with his photo- 
graph under a gold seven-point- 
ed star. He touched it to his fore- 
head and it glowed into light, a 
factitious display which impress- 
ed the Imp. He instantly became 
effusive in his cordiality. “Nev- 
er did think that Mr. Spock was 
up to good. He’ll come to a bad 



end, mark my words! What’s he 
done now?” 

“Kidnap. Murder.” 

“Bad deeds, both. I’ll have to 
caution Mr. Spock.” 

“He is a wicked man. How 
long has he lived here?” 
“Donkey’s years.” 

“You know him well, then?” 
‘Well indeed. Who drinks 
with him when everyone else 
turns their heads as if Mr. Spock 
smelt poorly? Me. I drink with 
him, and frequently. I have my 
compassion.” 

“So you’re Spock’s friend?” 

'T'he big features twisted and 
moved in successive displays 
of tolerance, crafty speculation, 
virtuous indignation. “I? Cer- 
tainly not. Do I look the sort 
who consorts with criminals?” 
“But — let us say — you have 
heard Spock talking.” 

“That I have, and oh the tales 
he tells!” The Imp’s eyes rolled 
ludicrously upward. “Do I be- 
lieve him? No.” 

“Has he ever spoken of a se- 
cret world where he has a hide- 
away?” 

“Again and again. He calls it 
Thumbnail Gulch. Why? He al- 
ways shakes his head when he’s 
asked. A tight-mouthed man, 
Mr. Spock, for all his loose brag- 
gadocio.” 

“What more has he said of 
his world?” 



THE STAR KING 



155 



The Imp shrugged. “The sun’s 
blood-red, hardly enough to keep 
him warm.” 

“And where is this world?” 
“Aha! That’s where he’s sly. 
No word of this will he speak. 
Many the time I’ve wondered, 
thinking that suppose poor Mr. 
Spock took sick on this lonesome 
world — who’d know to tell his 
friends?” 

Gersen smiled grimly. “And 
this argument never induced 
him to confide in you?” 

“Never. Why do you wish to 
know?” 

“He’s kidnaped an innocent 
young woman and taken her to 
this world.” 

“The rogue. What a raffish 
creature.” The Imp shook his 
head in distress, from which a 
certain measure of wistful envy 
was not absent. “I’ll never let 
my land and house to him 
again.” 

“Think. What has Spock said 
regarding the world?” 

The Imp screwed up his eyes. 
“Thumbnail Gulch. The world 
is bigger than the sun. Astonish- 
ing, no?” 

“If the sun is a red dwarf, not 
too astonishing.” 

“Volcanos. There are live vol- 
canos on this world.” 

“Volcanos? That’s odd. A red 
dwarf’s planet shouldn’t have 
volcanos. It’s too old.” 

“Old or young, the volcanos 



thrive. Mr. Spock lives in a dead 
crater, and he sees a whole line 
of volcanos smoking up along 
the horizon.” 

“What else?” 

“Nought.” 

“How long does it take to get 
to his planet?” 

“That I can’t say.” 

“You’ve never met any of his 
friends?” 

“Toss-pots at the tavern, no 
more. But yes. One. Less than a 
year ago — an Earthman, a heavy 
cruel man.” 

“Tristano ? 1 

“I know nothing of his name. 
Mr. Spock had just returned 
from a business trip Beyond, to 
a planet called New Hope. Do 
you know it?” 

“I’ve never been there.” 
“Nor I, though I’ve wandered 
far. But the very day of his re- 
turn, while we sit in Gelperino’s 
Saloon, the Earthman comes in. 
‘Where have you been?’ he asks. 
‘Ten days I’ve been here, and we 
left New Hope together.’ Mr. 
Spock gives him his haughty 
look. ‘If you must know, I looked 
in on my little hideaway for half 
a day. I have obligations there, 
you know.’ And the Earthman 
said no more.” 

Gersen thought a moment and 
suddenly was in a hurry to leave. 
“What more do you know about 
Spock?” 

“Nothing more.”

ersen made a last survey of 
the house, under the inquisi- 
tive scrutiny of the Imp, then 
departed, ignoring the Imp’s 
sudden harsh demands for dam- 
ages when he discovered the 
broken window sash. Hastily, 
now, Gersen rode down through 
the winding avenues, across Sail- 
maker Beach, back into central 
Avente. He went to an office of 
the Universal Technical Consul- 
tative Service, and gained the 
attention of an operator. 

“Set up this problem,” said 
Gersen. “Two ships leave the 
planet New Hope. One proceeds 
directly here, to Avente. The 
other goes to a red dwarf star, 
spends half a day, then comes to 
Avente, arriving ten days later. 
I want a list of the red dwarf 
stars which this second ship 
might have visited in the nine 
and a half days.” 

The operator considered. 
“There is obviously an ellipsoid 
shell here, the foci being New 
Hope and Alphanor. We must 
take into account the accelera- 
tions and decelerations, the prob- 
able coast periods and landing 
times. There will necessarily be 
a locus of most probability, and 
areas of diminishing probabil- 
ity.” 

“Set up the problem so that 
the machine lists these stars in 
order of probability.” 

“To what limits?” 



“Oh — one chance in fifty. In- 
clude also the constants of these 
stars as given in the directory 
here.” 

“Very well, sir. The fee will 
be 25 SVU.” 

Gersen brought forth money; 
the operator translated the prob- 
lem into precise language, spoke 
into a microphone. Thirty sec- 
onds later a sheet of paper 
dropped from a slot. The opera- 
tor glanced at it, signed his 
name, handed it without a word 
to Gersen. 

Forty-three stars were listed. 
Gersen compared the list with 
the page he had tom from 
Dasce’s Directory. A single star 
occurred on both lists. Gersen 
frowned in puzzlement. The star 
was a member of a binary, with- 
out planets. The couple was. 
Naturally! thought Gersen, il- 
lumination flooding his mind. 
How else could volcanos exist on 
the companion of a red dwarf? 
Dasce’s world was not a planet, 
but a dark star: a dead surface, 
perhaps still faintly warm. Ger- 
sen had heard of such worlds. 
Usually they were too dense, too 
massive for human occupancy, 
but if a small star in the course 
of two or three billion years hap- 
pened to sweep up enough detri- 
tus to build a thick shell of light 
material the surface gravity 
might well be reduced to a toler- 
able level.

\ t ten minutes to seven Kelle, 
Warweave and Detteras ap- 
peared at the space-port, wearing 
spacemen’s harness, their skins 
washed the blue-brown tone 
which originally, in popular cre- 
dence, was thought to protect the 
human organism from certain 
mysterious Jarnell effluviae, and 
which by usage had become a 
normal adjunct to the space- 
traveler’s accoutrements. They 
halted in the middle of the 
lobby, looked about, spied Ger- 
sen, turned to face him as he ap- 
proached. 

Gersen surveyed them with a 
dour smile. “We seem to be 
ready, all of us. I thank you 
gentlemen for your prompt- 
ness.” 

“Achieved at great inconve- 
nience to all of us,” stated Kelle. 

“In due course the reason for 
haste will become clear,” said 
Gersen. “Your luggage?” 

“On its way to the ship,” said 
Detteras. 

“Then we will leave. We have 
clearance?” 

“Everything has been ar- 
ranged,” said Warweave. 

The group proceeded from the 
lobby, walked around to the 
docking area, toward which a 
crane was already trundling. 

The luggage, four large cases 
and as many smaller packets, was 
stacked beside the ship. War- 
weave unlocked the entry ports; 



Gersen and Kelle passed the 
cases into the cabin. Detteras 
made a bluff attempt to assert 
command. “We have four com- 
partments aboard. I’ll take for- 
ward starboard; Kelle, you’ll 
have starboard aft; Warweave, 
port forward; Gersen, port aft. 
We might as well move our lug- 
gage out of the cabin.” 

“One moment,” said Gersen. 
“There is a situation that we 
must resolve before we proceed 
any further.” 

Detteras’s big face creased in 
a scowl. “What?” 

“We are two parties of interest 
here — at least two parties. Nei- 
ther trusts the other. We are go- 
ing Beyond, past the edge of law. 
All of us, recognizing this fact, 
have brought weapons. I propose 
that we lock all weapons in the 
security cabinet; that we open 
the luggage, and if necessary, 
strip ourselves naked, to assure 
each other that all the weapons 
have been declared. Since you 
are three to my one, if any ad- 
vantage lies to either side, it is 
to yours.” 

“A highly undignified pro- 
cess,” grumbled Detteras. 

Kelle, more equable now than 
Gersen could have believed, said, 
“Come now, Rundle. Gersen is 
merely verbalizing reality. In 
short, I agree with him. The 
more so since I carry no weap- 
ons.” 



158 



GALAXY 



Warweave made a careless ges- 
ture. “Search me, search my lug- 
gage; but let’s get under way.” 
Detteras shook his head, open- 
ed his case, withdrew a projac 
of great power, tossed it upon 
the table. “I have my doubts 
about the wisdom of this. I have 
nothing against Mr. Gersen per- 
sonally — but suppose he takes 
us to a far planet where he has 
accomplices waiting, who cap- 
ture us and hold us for ransom? 
Stranger crimes have occurred.” 
Gersen laughed. “If you con- 
sider this a real danger you need 
only remain here. I don’t care 
whether one goes or all go.” 
“What of your own weapons?” 
asked Warweave dryly. 

Gersen brought forth his pro- 
jac, a pair of stilettos, a dagger, 
four grenades the size of walnuts. 

“My word,” said Detteras. 
“You maintain quite an arma- 
ment.” 

“I occasionally have need for 
it,” said Gersen. “Now, the lug- 
gage. .” The accumulated arms 
were placed in a cabinet which 
was secured with four locks, each 
man retaining a key to one of 
the locks. 

The crane trundled up to the 
ship; the boom swung around. 
Hooks engaged in trammels; the 
ship jerked, hung free, was car- 
ried out on the field. 

Detteras went to the main con- 
sole and touched a button, which 



flashed a row of green lights. 
“Everything ready to go,” he 
said. “Tanks full, machinery in 
order.” 

Kelle cleared his throat, 
brought forth a handsomely 
mounted wooden case, bound in 
red leather. “This is one of the 
departmental rationalizers. You 
have Mr. Teehalt’s filament, I 
assume?” 

“Yes,” said Gersen. “I have the 
filament with me. But there is 
no hurry. Before we engage the 
monitor we must reach zero base- 
point, which is far distant.” 

“Very well,” said Detteras. 
“What are the coordinates?” 

Gersen brought forward a slip 
of paper. “If you will allow me,” 
he said politely, “I will make 
the settings on the auto-pilot.” 

With ill grace Detteras rose to 
his feet. “It seems to me that 
there is no longer reason for dis- 
trust. We have stripped our- 
selves of our weapons, all the 
issues have been settled. So let 
us all relax and behave amica- 
bly.” 

“With pleasure,” said Gersen. 

The ship was lowered to the 
launching pad, the crane disen- 
gaged and rolled away. The 
group settled themselves into 
take-off seats; Detteras started 
the automatic launching se- 
quence. There was a jar, a sense 
of acceleration, and Alphanor 
retreated below.

From the chapter Grendel 
the Monster, in the book 
THE DEMON PRINCES, 
by Caril Carphen, published 
by Elucidarian Press, New 
Wexford, Aloysius, Vega: 
... In our cursory summary we 
have seen how each Demon 
Prince is unique and highly in- 
dividuated, each displaying his 
characteristic style. 

This is all the more remark- 
able, in that the basic variety of 
possible crimes is limited and 
can be numbered on the fingers. 
There is crime for gain: extor- 
tion, robbery (which includes 
piracy and raids on settled com- 
munities), swindling in its in- 
finite guises. There is slavery, 
with its various manifestations: 
procuring, selling, and using 
slaves. Murder, coercion and tor- 
ture are merely adjuncts to these 
activities. The personal depravi- 
ties are are equally limited, and 
can be classified under sexual 
debauchery, sadism, violent acts 
prompted by pique, vindictive- 
ness, revenge, or vandalism. 

Doubtless the catalogue is in- 
complete, perhaps even illogical, 
but this is by the blow. I merely 
wish to display the basic paucity, 
in order to illustrate this point: 
that each of the Demon Princes, 
in inflicting one or another 
atrocity, impresses the act with 



his own style, and seems to create 
a new crime. 

In the previous chapters we 
have examined the maniacal Ko- 
kor Hekkus and his theories of 
absolute frightfulness; the devi- 
ous Viole Falushe, voluptuary, 
sybarite, and amateur of kin- 
aesthetics. 

Completely distinctive is 
Grendel the Monster, in style and 
mannerism. Rather than enlarg- 
ing himself, projecting a macro- 
scopic delineation of his person 
and deeds, to mesmerize his vic- 
tims and intimidate his enemies, 
Grendel prefers the possibly 
equalling chilling device of sil- 
ence, invisibility, dispassionate 
impersonality. There is no reli- 
able description of Grendel. Cer- 
tainly Grendel is a cognomen, 
derived from a folk-epic of an- 
cient Earth. He acts with impla- 
cable viciousness, although his 
cruelties are never wanton, and 
if he maintains a pleasure-palace 
after the style of Viole Falushe 
or Howard Alan Treesong, it is 
a well-guarded secret. 

Grendel’s activities are pri- 
marily extortion and slavery. In 
the Conclave of 1500 at Smade’s 
Planet, where five Demon Prince 
and a score of lesser operators 
met to define and circumscribe 
their activities, Grendel was al- 
lotted that sector of the Beyond 
centered on Ferrier’s Cluster. It 
included over a hundred settle- 



160 



GALAXY 



ments, towns and vicinities, up- 
on all of which Grendel levies 
assessments. He rarely encoun- 
ters protest or complaint, for he 
need merely cite the example of 
Mount Pleasant, a town of 5000 
persons, which declined to meet 
his demands. In the year 1499 
Grendel invited four other 
Princes to join him. The junta 
swept down upon the town, cap- 
tured and enslaved the entire 
population. 

On the planet Grabhorne he 
maintains a plantation of about 
ten thousand square miles, with 
a slave population estimated at 
twenty thousand. Here are care- 
fully tilled farms, factories which 
build exquisite furniture, musi- 
cal instruments and electronic 
mechanisms. The slaves are not 
overtly ill-treated, but working- 
hours are long, the dormitories 
are drab, social opportunities 
are restricted. Punishment is a 
term in the mines, which few 
survive. 

Grendel’s attention is usually 
wide and dispassionate, but he 
often focuses upon some individ- 
ual. The planet Caro lies in an 
area which none of the Demon 
Princes claim. Mayor Janous Pa- 
ragiglia of the city Desde es- 
poused and advocated a militia 
and space-navy sufficient to pro- 
tect Caro, and to seek out and 
destroy Grendel or any other of 
the Demon Princes who dared 



to attack Caro. Grendel kid- 
naped Janous Paragiglia and tor- 
tured him for thirty-nine days, 
telecasting the entire process to 
the cities of Caro, to all the plan- 
ets in his own sector and, in one 
of his rare acts of bravado, to 
the Rigel Concourse. 

As mentioned, his personal ap- 
petites are unknown. A rumor 
frequently encountered runs to 
the effect that Grendel enjoys 
engaging in personal gladiatorial 
duels with able-bodied enemies, 
with swords for weapons. Gren- 
del is said to exhibit superhuman 
strength and dexterity, and 
seems to derive a satisfaction 
from slowly hewing his oppo- 
nent to bits. 

Like certain other Demon 
Princes, Grendel maintains a dis- 
crete and respectable identity 
within the Oikumene, and if 
whispers are correct, occupies a 
prestigious position on one of the 
major worlds. 

\ lphanor became a misty pale 
disk, mingled with the stars. 
Within the ship the four men 
settled into an uneasy accommo- 
dation. Kelle and Warweave 
started a quiet conversation. Det- 
teras stared forward into star- 
spattered emptiness. Gersen 
watched the three men. 

One of them was a simulated 
man, Grendel the Monster. 
Which? 



THE STAR KING 



161 



Gersen thought he knew. 

There was still no certainty in 
his mind; his conjecture was 
based on indications, probabili- 
ties, suppositions. Grendel, for 
his part, must still feel secure in 
his incognito. He had no reason 
to suspect Gersen’s objective. He 
must still consider Gersen no 
more than an acquisitive locater 
out to drive as hard a bargain as 
he could. So much the better, 
thought Gersen, if it would help 
him to a sure identification. He 
wanted only the freedom of Pal- 
lis Atwrode and the death of 
Grendel. And of course, of Hil- 
demar Dasce. If Pallis Atwrode 
were dead — so much the worse 
for Dasce. 

Surreptitiously Gersen watch- 
ed his suspect. Was this man 
Grendel? It was frustrating to 
be so close to his goal. Grendel 
of course had his own plans. Be- 
hind the human skull worked 
thought-patterns incommensur- 
able with his own, moving to- 
ward a goal still obscure. 

Gersen could define at least 
three areas of uncertainty in the 
situation. First, did Grendel still 
carry weapons or have access to 
weapons previously concealed 
aboard the ship? A possibility, 
although Grendel might be re- 
lying entirely on the hidden 
tanks of anesthetic gas. 

Second, were either or both of 
the other men his accomplices? 



Again a possibility, but distinct- 
ly less strong. 

Third, and a less simple set of 
circumstances: what would hap- 
pen when the ship reached 
Dasce’s dead star? Here again 
variables piled on variables. Did 
Grendel know of Dasce’s hide- 
away? If so, would he recognize 
it by sight? The answers here 
were both Probably yes. 

The question then would be 
how to surprise and either cap- 
ture or kill Hildemar Dasce with 
out hindrance from Grendel. 

Gersen reached a decision. 
Detteras had urged the need for 
amicability. One thing was sure: 
amicability would be sternly 
tested before long. 

npime passed. A wary routine 
was established. Gersen chose 
a propitious time and gave the 
body of Suthiro to space. The 
ship slid effortlessly past shin- 
ing stars, at astounding speed, 
by means only vaguely compre- 
hensible to the men who con- 
trolled it. 

The pale of human civilization 
and law came to an end. The 
ship passed Beyond and struck 
up and out toward the dwindling 
fringes of the galaxy. Gersen 
kept steady if discreet surveil- 
lance over his three shipmates, 
wondering who would first show 
concern, anxiety or suspicion as 
to the immediate destination. 



162 



GALAXY 



This person was Kelle, though 
any of the three might have been 
muttering together out of Ger- 
sen’s hearing. “Where the devil 
are we headed?” Kelle inquired 
peevishly. “This is no area to 
attract a locater. We’re practical- 
ly in intergalactic space.” 
Gersen took up a relaxed posi- 
tion. “I have not been altogether 
candid with you three gentle- 
men.” 

Three faces turned swiftly, 
three pairs of eyes bored in at 
him. 

“What do you mean?” grated 
Detteras. 

“It is not a serious matter. I 
have been compelled to make a 
detour. After I perform a cer- 
tain errand, we will proceed 
with our original plans.” He 
raised his hand as Detteras took 
a deep breath. “It serves no pur- 
pose to admonish me. The situa- 
tion is unavoidable.” 

Warweave spoke in an icy 
voice: “What is this ‘situation’?” 
“I’ll be glad to explain, and 
I’m sure all of you will appre- 
ciate my predicament. First of all, 
I seem to have made an enemy 
of a well-known criminal. He is 
known as Grendel the Monster.” 
Gersen glanced from face to face. 
“Doubtless you all have heard 
of him. He is one of the Demon 
Princes. The day before we left 
one of his lieutenants, a creature 
named Hildemar Dasce, kid- 



naped a young woman I happen 
to be interested in, and conveyed 
her to a private world. I feel ob- 
ligated to this young woman. 
She is suffering through no fault 
of her own, but merely from 
Grendel’s desire, to punish or in- 
timidate me. I believe I have lo- 
cated Dasce’s planet. I plan to 
rescue this young woman, and I 
hope for your cooperation.” 
Detteras spoke in a voice thick 
with rage, “Why could you not 
have told us of your plans before 
we left? You insisted on leaving, 
you forced us to break our en- 
gagements at great inconve- 
nience — ” 

Gersen said mildly, “You have 
some cause for resentment but, 
since my own time is limited, I 
thought it best to combine the 
two projects.” He grinned as 
Detteras’s neck swelled in new 
fury. 

Kelle said meditatively, “The 
kidnaper has conveyed the 
young woman to a world in this 
vicinity?” 

“I think so. I hope so.” 

“And you expect our help in 
rescuing this young woman?” 
“Only in a passive sense. Just 
don’t interfere.” 

“Suppose the kidnaper kills 
you.” 

“The possibility exists. But I 
have the advantage of surprise. 
He must feel completely secure, 
and probably I will have no

great trouble overpowering him.” 

“ ‘Overpowering’ him?” in- 
quired Warweave, delicately sar- 
donic. 

“Overpowering or killing him.” 

A t this moment the Jamell 
kicked out, the ship whined 
down into ordinary velocities. 
Ahead glowed a dim red star. If 
it were double, its companion 
was yet invisible. 

Gersen said, “As I say, sur- 
prise is my most important as- 
set, so therefore I must ask that 
none of you through inadver- 
tence or malice use the radio.” 
Gersen already had disabled the 
radio, but he saw no reason to 
put Grendel on his guard. “I’ll 
explain my plans so that there 
can be no misunderstanding. 
First, I’ll bring the ship close 
enough to inspect the surface of 
the planet, but far enough out 
to avoid radar detection. If I lo- 
cate Dasce’s habitation, I’ll go to 
the far side of the world, ap- 
proach the surface and land as 
close to Dasce’s dwelling as feas- 
ible. Then I’ll take the platform 
flyer and do what must be done. 
The three of you need only wait 
till I return. Then we shall be 
once more on our way to Tee- 
halt’s planet. I know I can count 
on your cooperation, because I 
naturally shall take the monitor 
filament with me, and hide it 
somewhere. If I am killed, the 



filament will be lost. Naturally I 
will need the weapons which are 
now in the security locker, but 
I see no reason why you should 
object to that” 

No one spoke. Gersen studied 
their faces and laughed inward- 
ly. Grendel was posed with a 
maddening dilemma. If he 
should interfere and by some 
means warn Dasce, then Gersen 
might well be killed, and Gren- 
del’s hopes of acquiring Tee- 
halt’s planet dashed. Would he 
trade Dasce for the planet? Ger- 
sen was certain of his decision; 
Grendel was notoriously callous. 

Detteras heaved a deep sigh. 
“Gersen, you’re a subtle man. 
You’ve put us in a position 
where for motives of sweet rea- 
son we are forced to do your 
bidding.” 

“I assure you that my motives 
are irreproachable.” 

“Yes, yes, the damsel in dis- 
tress. All very well; we would 
not deny l}er the chance of 
rescue. My exasperation is not 
at your goals — if y.ou have told 
us the truth — but at your lack 
of candor.” 

With nothing to lose, Gersen 
became contrite. “Yes, perhaps 
I should have explained more 
carefully. But I am accustomed 
to working by myself. In any 
event, the situation is now as I 
have described it. Do I have the 
cooperation of you all?” 



164 



GALAXY 



“Humph,” said Warweave. 
“We have little choice, as you 
are perfectly well aware.” 

“Mr. Kelle?” asked Gersen. 
Kelle inclined his head. 

“Mr. Detteras?” 

“As Warweave points out, we 
have no choice.” 

“In that case I will proceed 
with my plans. The world on 
which we are to land is a dead 
star, not a planet.” 

“What about the gravity? 
Won’t it make habitation incon- 
venient?” asked Kelle. 

“We’ll know very shortly.” 

'IIT’arweave turned away, went 
* * to look out at the nearing 
red dwarf. 

The dark companion now- had 
became visible. It was a large 
brown-gray disk, three times the 
diameter of Alphanor, mottled 
and reticulated in black and 
umber. Gersen was pleased to 
find surrounding space rich in 
detritus. The radar screen indi- 
cated dozens of minuscule plane- 
toids and moonlets in orbits 
about each star. Gersen could ap- 
proach the dead star boldly with 
small fear of detection. A mo- 
mentary shift into intersplit 
braked the ship; another brought 
it to a state of lazy drifting a 
quarter-million miles above the 
now looming mass. 

The surface seemed dim and 
featureless, with vast areas cov- 



ered by what seemed oceans of 
chocolate-colored dust. The out- 
line of the world was sharp and 
stark against the black of space, 
indicating a sparse atmosphere. 
Gersen went to the macroscope 
to inspect the surface. The 
world’s relief leapt into perspec- 
tive. Chains of volcanic moun- 
tains netted the surface; there 
was a mesh of rifts and crevasses, 
a number of ancient isolated 
plutonic buttes, hundreds of vol- 
canos, some active, others dead 
or quiescent. 

Gersen set cross-bars on a 
short sharp peak at the demarca- 
tion between day and night. The 
object seemed not to move re- 
lative to the line of darkness : 
apparently the world held a con- 
stant face to its companion. In 
such case, Dasce’s dwelling would 
almost certainly be on the bright 
face, probably near the equator, 
at the longitude directly under 
the sun. He scrutinized the re- 
gion carefully, under high mag- 
nification. The area was large. 
There were dozens of volcanic 
craters, large and small. 

Gersen searched an hour. War- 
weave, Kelle and Detteras stood 
watching him with varying de- 
grees of impatience and sardonic 
dislike. 

Gersen reviewed his logic; it 
seemed to hang together. The red 
dwarf had been listed on a well- 
used page in Dasce’s Directory; 



THE STAR KING 



165 



it was tound within the requisite 
ellipsoidal shell: it had a dark 
star companion. This must be 
the star. And by every likelihood 
Dasce’s crater must be located 
somewhere within the warm sun- 
lit area below. 

An odd formation attracted 
his attention: a square plateau, 
with five mountain ranges radi- 
ating like the fingers of a hand. 
A phrase of the Melnoy Heights 
Imp occurred to him: “Thumb- 
nail Gulch”. At fullest magnifi- 
cation Gersen examined the area 
corresponding to the thumbnail. 
Certainly there was a small 
crater here. Certainly it seemed 
to show a slightly different col- 
or, a slightly different texture 
than the others. And there where 
the sunlight struck glancingly on 
the inside wall, a glint? And be- 
low, the faint shine of white? 

ersen reduced the magnifica- 
tion to study the surround- 
ing terrain. Even though Dasce 
might not detect approaching 
ships at planetary distances, his 
radar might warn him of some- 
one approaching for a landing. 
If he dropped down on the far 
side of the world, slanted in be- 
hind the horizon, to land behind 
' the plateau which formed the 
palm of the hand, he might well 
be able to surprise Dasce. 

He fed the necessary informa- 
tion into the course computer, 



engaged the autopilot. The ship 
veered and began its descent. 

Kelle, unable to contain his 
curiosity, asked, “Well? Have 
you found what you were look- 
ing for?” 

“I think so,” said Gersen. 

“If you are careless enough to 
be killed,” said Kelle, “you will 
put us to enormous inconve- 
nience.” 

Gersen nodded. “This is essen- 
tially what I meant to convey to 
you a short while ago. I am sure 
that you’ll help me, at least pas- 
sively.” 

“We have already agreed to 
this.” 

The dark star loomed below. 
The ship landed on a shelf of 
naked brown stone, a quarter 
mile from a heave of low black 
hills. The stone was the texture 
of brick. The surrounding plain 
displayed a surface resembling 
dried brown mud. 

Overhead the red dwarf bulk- 
ed large. The ship cast a dense 
black shadow. A thin wind blew 
small curls of dust across the 
plain, sifting a greenish blue 
powder into long herringbone 
drifts. 

Detteras said thoughtfully, 
“You know, I think it only fair 
that you leave the filament here. 
Why victimize us?” 

“I don’t plan to be killed, Mr. 
Detteras.” . 

“Your plans might go awry.” 



166 



GALAXY 



“If so, your troubles will seem 
very trivial in comparison to 
mine. May I have my weapons?” 

The locker was opened. The 
three watched warily while Ger- 
sen armed himself. He looked 
from face to face. In the mind of 
one of these men, feverish plots 
were hatching. Would he act as 
Gersen anticipated — which was 
to say, by not acting? 

Here was a chance Gersen 
must take. Suppose he were 
wrong. Suppose this were not 
Dasce’s planet and Grendel knew 
it; suppose Grendel through 
some intuition suspected Ger- 
sen’s goals — he might be ready 
to sacrifice his hopes of acquir- 
ing Teehalt’s world in order to 
maroon Gersen out here on this 
dark star. There was a precaution 
Gersen could take; it would be 
foolish for him not to do so. He 
stepped back into the engine 
room and detached a small but 
vital component from the energy 
reactor. He tucked it into his 
pouch along with the filament. 

Warweave, standing in the 
doorway, observed the act but 
made no comment. 

Gersen dressed himself in an 
air-suit and left the ship. Open- 
ing the forward hatch he winch- 
ed down the little platform fly- 
er, loaded aboard a spare air- 
suit and spare tanks of oxygen, 
and without further ceremony 
set out for Thumbnail Gulch, 



skimming low to the ground, the 
thin atmosphere keening over 
the wind-screen. 

nphe landscape was odd even to 
one accustomed to the terrain 
of strange planets : a dark spongy 
surface in varying shades of ma- 
roon, brown and gray, marred 
here and there by volcanic cones 
and low wallowing black hills. 
This might be true star-stuff — 
clinker remaining after the fires 
had died — or it might be sedi- 
ment swept up from space. More 
likely, both. Gersen wondered, 
did the awareness that he was 
traversing the surface of a dead 
star contribute to the sense of 
weirdness and unreality?' The 
thin atmosphere allowed abso- 
lute clarity of vision. The hori- 
zons were far, the panorama 
seemed endless. And overhead, 
the glowering sphere of the red 
dwarf, filling an eighth of the 
sky. 

The ground shouldered up to 
become the plateau, which com- 
prised the palm of the hand, a 
titanic flow of lava. Gersen 
swerved to the right. Far ahead 
he could see a line of black hills 
lying across the landscape like 
the back of a monstrous petrified 
triceratops. This was the 
“thumb”, at the end of which 
rose Dasce’s volcano. Gersen 
flew low to the ground, taking 
advantage of all possible cover. 



THE STAR KING

swerving in and out, close to the 
wall of the plateau, and so ap- 
proached the line of jagged 
black peaks. 

Slowly, cautiously, Gersen 
eased up the tumbled slopes, jets 
muffled by the thin air to no 
more than a mutter. Dasce might 
have installed detectors along 
these slopes. But it seemed hard- 
ly likely. Dasce would consider 
the effort superfluous. Why at- 
tack by land when a torpedo 
from space would be easier? 

Gersen gained the ridge. There 
two miles ahead, was the vol- 
cano which he hoped to be 
Dasce’s hideaway. Off to the side, 
down on the plain which con- 
tinued on and on indefinitely, 
was the most welcome sight of 
Gersen’s experience: a small 

space-boat. 

His hypothesis had been cor- 
rect. Here was Thumbnail Gulch 
in all certainty; here would be 
found Hildemar Dasce. And Pal- 
lis Atwrode? 

Gersen landed the platform 
and continued on foot, taking ad- 
vantage of all possible cover, 
avoiding approaches where de- 
tectors would be most likely. He 
mounted the slopes of mingled 
basalt, obsidian and tuff. Reach- 
ing the lip of the crater, he 
peered cautiously over — out on 
a webbed dome constructed of 
thin cables, transparent film, 
held distended by air pressure. 



The crater was not large: fifty 
yards in diameter and almost 
perfectly cylindrical, the walls 
being formed of striated volcanic 
glass. 

At the bottom of the crater 
Dasce had made a careless ges- 
ture at landscaping. There was 
a pond of brackish water, a 
clump of palm trees, a tangle of 
rank vines. 

In the center of the crater was 
a cage, and in the cage sat a 
naked man. Tall, haggard, his 
face was a ghastly wreck, his 
body crooked, marked with a 
hundred welts. Gersen remem- 
bered Suthiro’s explanation of 
how Dasce lost his eyelids. Look- 
ing again he remembered the 
photographs in Dasce’s parlor. 
This man was the subject of the 
photographs. 

ersen looked elsewhere. Di- 
rectly below was a pavilion 
of black cloth, a series of con- 
nected tents. There was no sign 
of Hildemar Dasce. Entrance to 
the crater was apparently by 
way of a tunnel leading through 
the wall of the volcano. 

Gersen moved carefully 
around the lip, looked down over 
the slope. The porous brown- 
black plain extended limitlessly 
off in three directions. Nearby 
rested the space-boat, seeming no 
larger than a toy in the clarity 
of the atmosphere.

GALAXY 



Gersen turned his attention 
back to the dome. With a knife 
he cut a small slit in the film, 
then settled himself to watch. 

Ten minutes passed before the 
pressure-drop activated a warn- 
ing signal. Then out from one of 
the tents charged Hildemar 
Dasce. 

He wore only loose white pan- 
taloons. His torso, stained a 
faded purple, was ribbed with 
muscle. He stared up with lid- 
less eyes, the blue cheeks bloom- 
ing from the vermilion face. 

Dasce marched across the 
crater floor. The prisoner with- 
in the cage followed him atten- 
tively with his gaze. 

Dasce vanished from sight. Ger- 
sen hid in a crevice. Dasce pres- 
ently emerged on the plain in 
an air-suit, carrying a case. He 
mounted the crater wall with 
strong easy strides, passing close 
by Gersen. 

Dasce put down the case, 
brought forth a projector, swept 
a beam of radiation over the sur- 
face of the dome. The escaping 
air, evidently dosed with a fluo- 
rescent agent, glowed yellow. 
Dasce went to the cut and bent 
over it, and Gersen felt his in- 
stant suspicion. He straightened 
up, looked all around, and Ger- 
sen crouched back out of sight. 

When he looked once more, 
Dasce was at work mending the 
rip with cement and a new strip 

THE STAR KING 



of film. The entire operation re- 
quired but a minute. Then Dasce 
replaced the unused material 
and the projector into the case 
and straightened up. He made 
another careful scrutiny of rim, 
slope and plain; then, suspicion 
blunted, he started back down 
the slope. 

Gersen rose from his hiding 
place and followed, not fifty feet 
behind. 

Dasce, jumping from rock to 
rock down the slope, failed to 
look back — until Gersen dis- 
lodged a rock which bounded 
ahead and past. Dasce stopped, 
turned sharply. Gersen was out 
of sight behind a jut of rock. 

Dasce proceeded. Gersen fol- 
lowed close behind. At the base 
of the slope a sound, a vibration, 
alarmed Dasce. Once more he 
turned to look up-slope — direct- 
ly at the figure bounding down 
on him. Gersen saw the loose 
pale mouth open in startlement, 
and then he struck. Dasce top- 
pled, rolled, bounded to his feet, 
started to run awkwardly for the 
air-lock ; Gersen fired at the back 
of one of the rangy thighs. Dasce 
fell. 

G ersen seized him by the an- 
kles, dragged him into the 
air-lock, slammed the outer door. 
Dasce struggled and kicked, the 
red and blue face hideously con- 
torted. Gersen pointed the pro- 



169 



' \ 

jac, but Dasce merely tried to 
kick it from his grasp. Gersen 
fired again, numbing Dasce’s 
other leg. Dasce lay still, glaring 
like a boar at bay. With a roll 
of tape brought hopefully for 
the purpose, Gersen lashed 
Dasce’s ankles. Then warily he 
seized the right arm, bent it 
back and around. Dasce was 
forced over on his face. Present- 
ly, after a struggle, his arms were 
taped behind his back. 

The lock mechanism automa- 
tically had filled the space with 
air. Gersen now removed the 
vitrine globe from Dasce’s head. 

“We renew our acquaintance,” 
said Gersen in a pleasant voice. 

Dasce said nothing. 

Gersen dragged him out into 
the floor of the crater. The pris- 
oner jumped to his feet, pressed 
himself to the bars of the cage 
and stared at Gersen as if he 
were an archangel, with wings, 
trumpet and aureole. 

Gersen assured himself as to 
the security of Dasce’s bonds, 
ran over to the tent, pro jac ready 
for an unexpected servitor or 
comrade-in-arms of Dasce’s. The 
prisoner looked after him with 
unbelieving eyes. 

Pallis Atwrode lay huddled 
■under a limp dirty sheet, face to 
the wall. There was no one else. 
Gersen touched her on the shoul- 
der, and fascinatedly watched 
her flesh crawl. “Pallis,” he said. 



“Pallis — it’s Kirth Gersen.” The 
words reached her, muffled by 
the globe which Gersen still 
wore; she only crouched and 
huddled more tightly. Gersen 
rolled her over. She lay with her 
eyes shut. Her face, once so gay 
and impudent and charming, was 
bleak. “Pallis,” called Gersen, 
“open your eyes. It’s Kirth Ger- 
sen! You’re safe!” 

She shook her head slightly, 
her eyes tight shut. 

Gersen turned away. At the 
door to the tent he looked back. 
Her eyes were wide open, staring 
in wonder, but she instantly 
closed them again. 

Gersen left her, investigated 
the entire crater, reassured him- 
self that no one else was present 
and returned to Dasce. 

“Nice place you’ve got here, 
Dasce,” said Gersen in a conver- 
sational tone. “A little hard to 
find when your friends want to 
drop in.” 

“How did you find me?” said 
Dasce in a guttural voice. “No 
one knows of this place.” 
“Except your boss.” 

“He doesn’t know.” 

“How do you think I found 
out?” 

Dasce was silent. Gersen went 
to the cage, unbarred the door 
and motioned to the prisoner, 
wondering whether the man’s 
mind had also failed him. “Come 
out.” 



170 



GALAXY 



The prisoner limped halting- 
ly forward. “Who are you?” 
“No matter. You are free.” 

“ ‘Free’?” The man worked his 
loose jaws over the word, turned 
to look toward Dasce. He spoke 
in a reverent voice. “What of 
him?” 

“I shall kill him presently.” 
The man said softly, “This 
must be a dream.” 

/^ersen returned to Pallis. She 
was sitting on the bed, the 
sheet clutched around her. Her 
eyes were open. She looked at 
Gersen, rose to her feet, and 
fainted. 

Gersen lifted her, carried her 
out to the crater floor. The erst- 
while captive stood looking at 
Dasce from a respectful distance. 
Gersen spoke to him. “What is 
your name?” 

The man looked momentarily 
bewildered. “I am Robin Ram- 
pold,” he said in a soft hushed 
voice. “And you — you are his 
enemy?” 

“I am his executioner.” 

“It is a marvel!” breathed 
Rampold. “After so long that I 
cannot remember the begin- 
ning. .” T ears began to course 
down his cheeks. He looked at 
the cage, walked over to it, stud- 
ied it, then looked back at Ger- 
sen. “I know this place well. 
Each crack, each crevice, each 
fleck and crystal of the metal.” 



His voice faded. Suddenly he 
asked, “What is the year?” 

“ 1524 .” 

Rampold seemed to become 
smaller. “I did not know it was 
so long. I have forgotten so 
much.” He looked up toward the 
dome. “There is no day or night 
here — nothing but the red sun. 
When he is gone, there are no 
events. Seventeen years I have 
stood in that cage. And now I 
am out.” He walked over to 
Dasce, stood looking down at 
him. Gersen followed. Rampold 
said, “Long, long ago we were 
two different people. I taught 
him a lesson. I made him suffer. 
The memory is all that has kept 
me alive.” 

Dasce laughed a harsh cackle. 
“I have sought to repay you.” 
He glanced up toward Gersen. 
“Best kill me while you can, or 
I will do the same.” 

Gersen stood reflecting. Dasce 
must die. There would be no 
compunction when the time 
came. But behind the red fore- 
head was knowledge which Ger- 
sen needed. How to extract this 
knowledge? Torture? Gersen sus- 
pected that Dasce would laugh 
while being torn limb from limb. 
Trickery? Subtlety? He looked 
speculatively down into the 
course red and blue face. Dasce 
did not flinch. Gersen turned to 
Rampold. “Can you navigate 
Dasce’s space-boat?” 



THE STAR KING 



171 



Rampold sadly shook his head. 
“Then I suppose you must 
come with me.” 

Rampold spoke in a tremulous 
voice, “What of him?” 
“Eventually I’ll kill him.” 
Rampold said in a low voice, 
“Give him to me.” 

“No.” Gersen returned to the 
inspection of Dasce. Somehow 
he must be made to reveal the 
identity of Grendel. A direct 
question would be worse than 
useless. “Dasce,” he asked, “why 
did you bring Pallis Atwrode 
out here?” 

“She was too beautiful to kill,” 
said Dasce easily. “Still, I enjoy 
killing beautiful women.” 
Gersen grinned. Dasce possi- 
bly hoped to provoke him. “You 
may or may not live to regret 
your sins.” 

“Who sent you here?” asked 
Dasce. 

“Someone who knew.” 

Dasce slowly shook his head. 
“There is only one, and he nev- 
er sent you.” 

So much for that ploy, thought 
Gersen. Dasce would not easily 
be deceived. Well then. He would 
take Dasce aboard the ship. The 
situation was certain to produce 
some sort of reaction. 

Now a new problem. He did 
not dare leave Robin Rampold 
alone with Dasce, not even for 
long enough to fetch the plat- 
form. Rampold might kill Dasce. 



Or Dasce might command Ram- 
pold to release him. After seven- 
teen years of degradation, Ram- 
pold might be sufficiently under 
Dasce’s influence to obey. And 
Pallis Atwrode, what of her? 

Gersen locked Dasce in the 
cage. He assisted Rampold into 
an air-suit and took him back to 
the platform. 

Jets roaring at full power, the 
over-loaded platform lurched 
sluggishly around the plateau, 
blowing up a fan of dust which 
settled with startling rapidity in 
the thin atmosphere. Ahead stood 
the space-ship, minute against 
the sweep of the vast horizon. 
Gersen landed close beside the 
entrance port. Hand-weapon 
within easy reach, he climbed 
the accommodation ladder. 

Inside, Grendel had watched 
his approach, had seen the cargo. 
Grendel could not know what 
Dasce had told Gersen. He must 
be taut with indecision. Dasce, 
who would recognize the ship, 
might suspect but could not be 
sure that Grendel was aboard. 

The air-lock thudded shut, the 
pumps throbbed, the inner door 
swung open. Gersen stepped for- 
ward. Kelle, Detteras, Warweave 
sat at various quarters of the 
room. They looked at him with- 
out friendliness. No one moved. 

Gersen unfastened the head- 
globe. “I’m back.” 



172 



GALAXY 



“So we see,” said Detteras. 
“I’ve been successful,” said 
Gersen. “I’ve got a captive with 
me: Hildemar Dasce. A word of 
warning to you. This man is a 
brutal murderer. He is desper- 
ate. I intend to hold him under 
rigid conditions. I ask that none 
of you interfere or have anything 
to do with this man. The other 
two persons are a man Dasce has 
kept penned in a cage for seven- 
teen years, and a young woman 
whom Dasce recently kidnaped 
and whose mind has suffered in 
consequence. She shall use my 
cabin. I shall keep Dasce in the 
cargo hold. The other man, 
Robin Rampold, will no doubt 
be happy for the use of a settee.” 
“This voyage becomes stranger 
by the hour,” said Warweave. 

Detteras rose impatiently to 
his feet. “Why do you bring this 
man Dasce aboard? I’m surprised 
you haven’t killed him.” 
“Consider me squeamish.” 
Detteras gave a bark of sour 
laughter. “Let us proceed. We 
are anxious to get this trip over 
as fast as possible.” 

Gersen sent Rampold into the 
ship with Pallis Atwrode; then 
with a winch, he slid the plat- 
form with Dasce aboard, into the 
cargo hold, where he removed 
Dasce’s head-globe. Dasce glared 
at him wordlessly. 

“You may see someone aboard 
you recognize,” said Gersen. 



Dasce said nothing. Gersen se- 
cured him with exceeding care. 
At the center of a long cable he 
made a loop which he knotted 
and clamped tightly around 
Dasce’s neck. The ends of the 
cable he made fast at opposite 
sides of the hold, stretching the 
cable taut. Dasce was now con- 
stricted in the middle of the 
hold, the cable extending past 
him to right and left, the ends 
ten feet out of his reach to ei- 
ther side. Even with hands free 
Dasce would not work himself 
loose. Gersen now cut the tapes 
binding Dasce’s arms and legs. 
Dasce instantly struck out. Ger- 
sen dodged aside and clubbed 
Dasce with the butt of his weap- 
on. Dasce reeled over senseless. 
Gersen slipped off Dasc’s air- 
suit, searched the pockets of the 
white pantaloons, finding noth- 
ing. He made a final check of 
the bonds, then returned to the 
main saloon, bolting the hatch 
behind him. 

Rampold had divested himself 
of his air-suit and sat quietly 
in a corner. Detteras and Kelle 
had done the same for Pallis At- 
wrode, and had dressed her in 
spare clothing. Kelle cast a 
glance of disapprobation toward 
Gersen. “This is Miss Atwrode, 
the receptionist at the depart- 
ment. What in the name of heav- 
en is she doing out here?” 

“The answer is perfectly sim-

THE STAR KING 




pie,” said Gersen. “I met her the 
first day I visited the university 
and asked her out for the eve- 
ning. For sheer malice, Hilde- 
mar Dasce struck me down and 
kidnaped her. I felt it was my 
duty to rescue her.” 

Kelle smiled thinly. “I suppose 
we can’t fault you for this.” 
Warweave spoke in the driest 
of voices: “Presumably we will 
now make for our original des- 
tination.” 

“Yes,” grumbled Detteras. 
“The sooner we put a term to 
this fantastic voyage the better.” 

r T''he dark star and its feeble red 
-*■ companion became one with 
space. In the hold Hildemar 



Dasce, recovering consciousness, 
swore a low vile mutter and test- 
ed his bonds with insensate fero- 
city. He tore and twisted at the 
clamps till the skin peeled from 
his fingers; he plucked at the 
metal strands in the cable till 
his fingernails broke. Then he 
tried a new procedure. Thrust- 
ing against the floor, lunging 
from side to side, he tried to pull 
the cable loose from where it was 
fastened at the walls : first to 
the right, then to the left. He 
succeeded only in bruising his 
neck. 

Assured that he was in fact 
helpless, though hands and feet 
were free, he relaxed, panting. 
His mind seethed with emotion. 



174 



GALAXY 





How had Gersen located the 
dark star? No one alive knew the 
location but himself . and 
Grendel. Dasce reviewed the oc- 
casions on which he had circum- 
vented, cheated or failed Gren- 
del and wondered if one of these 
occasions might not have come 
home to roost. 

In the saloon Gersen sat 
brooding on a settee. The three 
men from the university — one 
of whom was not a man — stood 
together far forward. There was 
Kelle: suave, fastidious, compact 
in physique; Warweave: ecto- 
morphic, saturnine; Detteras: 
large-bodied, restless, moody. 
Gersen eyed his suspect, probing 
his every act, word and gesture 



for corroboration, for some sign 
to provide the absolute assur- 
ance he needed. Pallis Atwrode 
sat quietly nearby, lost in re- 
verie. From time to time her 
face twitched, her fingers clench- 
ed into her palms. 

There would be no qualms to 
the kiting of Hildemar Dasce. 

Robin Rampold stood listless- 
ly at the microfilm library, look- 
ing at the index, stroking his 
long bony chin. He turned, 
glanced toward Gersen, sidled 
across the room wolfishly. In a 
voice so polite as to seem servile 
he asked, “He — is he alive?” 
“For the moment.” 

Rampold hesitated, opened 
his mouth, closed it again. Final- 



THE STAR KING 



175 



ly he asked diffidently, “What 
do you plan for him?” 

“I don’t know,” said Gersen. 
“I want to make use of him.” 

D ampold became very earnest. 

He spoke in a low voice, as 
if afraid that the other occu- 
pants of the saloon would hear. 
“Why not put him into my 
charge? Then you would be re- 
lieved of the effort of guarding 
and tending him.” 

“No,” said Gersen, “I think 
not.” 

Rampold’s face became even 
more haggard and desperate. 
“But — I must.” 

“You must?” 

Rampold nodded. “You can- 
not understand. For seventeen 
years he has been — ” He could 
not find words. Finally he said, 
“He has been the center of my 
existence. He has been like a per- 
sonal god. He has provided food 
and drink and pain. Once he 
brought me a kitten — a beauti- 
ful black kitten. He watched as 
I touched it, smiling as if be- 
nign. That time I thwarted him. 
I killed the little creature at 
once, because I knew his plan. 
He wanted to wait until I came 
to love it, then he would torture 
it where I could watch. Of 
course he made me pay.” 
Gersen drew a deep breath. 
“He has too much power over 
you. I can’t trust you with him.” 



Tears began to form in Ram- 
pold’s eyes. He spoke in a series 
of disjointed sentences. “It is 
strange. I feel grief now. What 
I feel for him I cannot put into 
words. It goes to an extreme and 
beyond and becomes almost ten- 
derness. Substances can be so 
sweet that they taste bitter, so 
sour that they taste salt. Yes, 
I would care for him with great 
pains. I would devote the rest of 
my life to him.” He held out his 
hands. “Give him to me. I have 
nothing, or I would repay you.” 

Gersen could only shake his 
heard. “We will talk of this 
later.” 

Rampold nodded heavily, re- 
turned across the room. Gersen 
looked forward to where Detter- 
as, Kelle and Warweave contin- 
ued a desultory conversation. 
Apparently they were agreed on 
a policy of disinterest toward the 
new passengers. Gersen smiled 
grimly. He who was Grendel 
would not care to confront Hil- 
demar Dasce. Dasce’s tempera- 
ment was not a subtle one; he 
was as likely as not to blurt out 
some damaging disclosure. Gren- 
del would certainly try for a 
few quiet words of warning and 
reassurance, or conceivably an 
opportunity to discreetly mur- 
der Dasce. 

The situation was unstable; 
sooner or later it was bound to 
collapse into more truthful rela- 



176 



GALAXY 



tionships. Gersen toyed with the 
idea of precipitating the col- 
lapse, but decided to bide his 
time. 

He still carried his weapons. 
The three from the university, 
apparently assured of his good 
intentions, had not required that 
he restore them to the locker. 
Amazing, thought Gersen. Even 
now Grendel could have no 
cause to suspect that Gersen 
stalked him. He would be less 
wary than he might be, and using 
the pretext of curiosity, might 
well seek to look in on Dasce. 

Vigilance, thought Gersen. It 
occurred to him that Robin 
Rampold would be a useful ally 
in this situation. No matter 
what distortions and sublima- 
tions seventeen years had pro- 
duced, he would be no less alert 
than Gersen himself ... in any 
matters relating to Hildemar 
Dasce. 

ersen rose to his feet, went 
aft, through the engine room, 
into the cargo hold. Dasce, mak- 
ing no pretense of stoic resigna- 
tion. glared at him. Gersen noted 
Dasce’s bleeding fingers. Putting 
his projac on a shelf to void the 
possibility of Dasce wresting it 
away from him, he stepped close 
to check Dasce’s bonds. Dasce 
kicked savagely. Gersen hacked 
him behind the ear with the side 
of his hand, and Dasce fell back. 



Gersen assured himself as to the 
clamps which constricted the 
cable around Dasce’s neck, then 
moved back, out of Dasce’s reach 
“It seems,” said Gersen, “that 
troubles are catching up with 
you.” 

Dasce spat at him. 

“Fah! What more can you do 
to me? Do you think I fear 
death? I live only out of hate.” 
“Rampold has asked that I 
give you into his care.” 

Dasce sneered. “He fears me 
until he reeks and crawls. He is 
soft as honey. It was no longer 
gratifying to hurt him.” 

“I wonder how long it will 
take to make the same sort of 
man out of you.” 

Dasce spat once more. Then 
he said, “Tell me how you found 
my star.” 

“I had information.” 

“From whom?” 

“What difference does it 
make?” said Gersen. He thought 
to insert an idea into Dasce’s 
mind. “You’ll never have the 
opportunity of paying him off.” 
Dasce pulled back his mouth 
in a hideous grin. “Who is 
aboard this ship?” 

Gersen made no reply. Stand- 
ing back in the shadows, he 
watched Dasce. He must suspect, 
to the point of certainty, that 
Grendel was aboard. Dasce could 
be no less uncertain than Gren- 
del himself. 



THE STAR KING 



177 



Gersen framed and discarded 
a half-dozen questions calcu- 
lated to trick Grendel’s name 
from Dasce. They were either 
too clumsy or too subtle; they 
would apprise Dasce that Ger- 
sen wanted information, and so 
put him on his guard. 

T^vasce tried to wheedle. “Come! 

As you say, I am helpless, at 
your mercy. I am interested in 
learning who betrayed me.” 
“Who do you think it might 
be?” 

Dasce grinned ingenuously. “I 
have a number of enemies. For 
instance, the Sarkoy. Was it he?” 
“The Sarkoy is dead.” 
“Dead!” 

“He helped you kidnap the 
young woman. I poisoned him.” 
“Fah,” spat Dasce. “Women 
are everywhere. Why become ex- 
cited? Release me. I have wealth 
and I will pay you half — if you 
tell me who betrayed me.” 

“It was not Suthiro the Sar- 
koy.” 

“Tristano? Surely not Tris- 
tano. How could he know?” 
“When I met Tristano he had 
little to say.” 

“Who then?” 

Gersen said, “Very well, I’ll 
tell you; why not? An adminis- 
'trator at the Sea Province Uni- 
versity gave me the information.” 
Dasce rubbed his hand over 
his mouth, looked sidewise at 



Gersen in suspicion and doubt. 
“Why should he do so?” he mut- 
tered. “I can’t understand any 
of this.” 

Gersen had hoped to surprise 
an exclamation from Dasce. He 
asked, “Do you know whom I 
refer to?” 

But Dasce only looked at him 
blankly. Gersen picked up his 
projac, left the hold. 

Returning to the saloon he 
found conditions as before. He 
signaled Robin Rampold back 
into the engine room. “You 
asked that Dasce might be put 
into your charge.” 

Rampold eyed him in tremu- 
lous excitement. “Yes!” 

“I cannot do this, but I need 
your help in guarding him.” 

“Of course!” 

“Dasce is tricky. You must 
never enter the cargo hold.” 

Rampold winced in disa- 
pointment. 

“Equally important, you must 
not allow anyone else near the 
cargo hold. These men are 
Dasce’s enemies. They might kill 
him.” 

“No, no!” exclaimed Rampold. 
“Dasce must not die!” 

Gersen had a new thought. 
Grendel had ordained the death 
of Pallis Atwrode for fear that 
unwittingly she might reveal his 
identity. In her present state she 
posed no threat; nevertheless she 
might recover. Grendel might

well wish to destroy her, if he 
could do so without risk. Gersen 
said, “Also, you must guard Pal- 
lis Atwrode, and make sure that 
no one disturbs her.” 

Rampold was less interested. 
“I will do what you ask.” 

XI 

From The Avatar's Appren- 
tice, in Scroll from the 
Ninth Dimension: 

Intelligence? asked Marma- 
duke at one of the permitted in- 
tervals, as he attended the EMI- 
NENCE upon the Parapet. What 
is intelligence? 

Why, responded the EMI- 
NENCE, it is no more than a 
human occupation: an activity 
which men put their brains to, 
as a frog kicks his legs to swim; 
it is a standard which men in 
their egotism use to measure oth- 
er and perhaps nobler races, who 
are thereby dumbfounded. 

Do you mean, REVERED 
GRAY, that no living creature 
other than man can share the 
quality of intelligence? 

But ha! And why should I not 
ask, what is LIFE, what is LIV- 
ING, but a disease of the primor- 
dial slime, a purulence in the 
original candid mud, which cul- 
minates through cycles and de- 
grees, by distillations and sedi- 
ments, in the human manifesta- 
tion? 



But, REVERED, it is known 
that other worlds demonstrate 
this fact of LIFE. I allude to 
the jewels of Olam, as well as the 
folk of the Chthonian Bog. 

Witling, how have you glanced 
off the exact stroke of the ES- 
SENCE. 

REVERED, I crave your in- 
dulgence. 

The way along the Parapet is 
not to the forward-footed. 

REVERED GRAY, pray that 
my direction be defined. 

Eight tones of the gong have 
sounded. Be content for the 
nonce, and fetch the morning 
wine. 

r Tphe filament from Lugo Tee- 
halt’s monitor fed impulses in- 
to the computer, which digested 
the information, combined it 
with the equations describing 
the ship’s previous position and 
dispatched instructions to the 
auto-pilot which swerved the 
ship off and away, on a course 
roughly parallel to the line be- 
tween Alphanor and Smade’s 
Planet. Time passed. Life within 
the ship fell into a routine. Ger- 
sen, assisted by Robin Rampold, 
guarded the cargo hold, though 
Gersen forbade Rampold entry 
into the hold itself. Hildemar 
Dasce for the first few days 
evinced a brassy jocularity, al- 
ternating with earnest threats of 
vengeance at the hands of an 



THE STAR KING 



179 



agent he refused to identify. 
“Ask Rampold what he thinks,” 
said Dasce, leering from his 
bright blue iidless eyes. “Do you 
want this happening to you?” 
“No,” said Gersen. “I don’t 
think it’s going to happen.” 
Occasionally Dasce demanded 
that Gersen answer his ques- 
tions. “Where are you taking 
me?” he would ask. “Back to 
Alphanor?” 

“No.” 

“Where then?” 

“You’ll see.” 

“Answer me, or by — ” here 
Dasce swore obscene oaths — 
“I’ll do you worse than you’ve 
ever imagined!” 

“It’s a chance we have to take,” 
said Gersen. 

“ ‘We’?” asked Dasce softly. 
“Who is ‘we’?” 

“Don’t you know?” 

“Why doesn’t he come in here? 
Tell him I want to talk to him.” 
“Any time he wants he can 
come in.” 

At that Dasce fell silent. Goad, 
prod, pry as he might, Gersen 
never could induce Dasce to ut- 
ter a name. Nor did any of the 
three from the university show 
interest in Dasce. 

As for Pallis Atwrode, her de- 
tachment, if anything, became 
more profound. For hours she 
would sit, looking out at the 
passing stars. At times she ate, 
slowly, hesitantly, without hun- 



ger; she slept hours on end, 
curled into as tight a ball as 
possible. She spoke to no one, 
and submitted without protest 
to the ministrations of Gersen 
and Rampold. 

A /T ore time passed. The ship 
traversed new regions, and 
regions after regions where no 
man had passed but one: Lugo 
Teehalt. To all sides hung stars 
by the thousand and the mil- 
lion: streaming, swarming, flow- 
ing, glaring, glittering; shifting 
silently one across the other, and 
the other across another still — 
worlds of infinite variety, popu- 
lated by who knows whom; each 
drawing the eye, fixing the imag- 
ination, evoking wonder; each 
world an urge, a temptation, a 
mystery; each a promise of un- 
seen sights, unknown knowledge, 
unsensed beauty. 

Eventually a warm golden- 
white star showed dead ahead. 

The monitor panel blinked al- 
ternately green, red, green, red. 
The auto-pilot choked down the 
energy output; the split began 
to collapse; the ship set up a 
weird sub-sound as eddies and 
disturbances and back-drafts of 
a substance which could only be 
called space sucked at its fabric. 

The split collapsed with a 
slight shock; the ship slid serene- 
ly, like a boat drifting on a pond. 

The golden-white sun hung 



180 



GALAXY 



close at hand, controlling three 
planets. One was orange, small 
and near, a fuming cinder. An- 
other swung in a far orbit, a 
gloomy dismal world, the color 
of tears. The third, sparkling 
green and blue and white, re- 
volved close below the ship. 

Gersen, Warweave, Detteras 
and Kelle, antagonisms tempo- 
rarily set aside, bent over the 
macroscope. The world was 
clearly beautiful, with a thick 
moist atmosphere, ample oceans, 
a varied topography. 

Gersen was the first to stand 
away from the screen. The time 
had come to hone his vigilance 
to its sharpest edge. Warweave 
stood back next. “I’m complete- 
ly satisfied. The planet is non- 
pareil. Mr. Gersen has not de- 
ceived us.” 

Kelle looked at him in sur- 
prise. “You think it unnecessary 
to land?” 

“I do think it unnecessary, 
but I am willing to land.” He 
moved across the cabin, stood 
near the shelf to which was af- 
fixed Suthiro’s switch. Gersen 
tensed. Is it to be Warweave? 
But Warweave passed on. Ger- 
sen released his pent breath. Of 
course the time was not yet. To 
profit from the gas, Grendel 
must somehow protect himself 
from its influence. 

Kelle said, “I certainly believe 
that we should land, at least to 



make biometrics. In spite of its 
appearance the world may be 
completely unfriendly.” 

Detteras said doubtfully, “It’s 
rather awkward, with captives 
and invalids and passengers. The 
sooner back to Alphanor the 
better.” 

Kelle snapped in a voice as 
sharp as any Gersen had heard 
him use, “You talk like a jack- 
ass. All this way, merely to turn 
tail and run home? Obviously 
we must land, if only to walk 
out on the planet for five min- 
utes!” 

“Yes,” said Detteras glumly. 
“No doubt you’re right.” 

“Very well,” said Warweave. 
“Down we go.” 

G ersen wordlessly swung the 
auto-pilot toggle over into the 
landing program. The horizons 
extended, the landscape became 
distinct: green parkland, low 

rolling hills, a chain of lakes to 
the north, a range of snow-clad 
crags to the south. The ship set- 
tled to the ground; the roar of 
exhaled energy ceased. There 
was now solidity underfoot, utter 
quiet except for the ticking of 
the automatic environment an- 
alyzer, which presently flashed 
three green lights: the optimum 
verdict. 

There was a short wait for 
pressure equalization. Gersen 
and the three men from the uni- 



THE STAR KING 



181 



versity donned exterior clothing, 
rubbed allergen-inhibitor on 
face, hands and neck, adjusted 
inhalators against bacteria and 
spores. 

Pallis Atwrode looked from 
the observation ports in inno- 
cent wonder. Robin Rampold 
sidled uneasily along the back 
bulkhead like a lean old gray 
rat, making tentative motions, as 
if he wished to alight but did 
not dare leave the sure security 
of the saloon. 

Air from outside flooded the 
boat, smelling fresh, damp, 
clean. Gersen went to the port, 
swung it open, made a polite if 
ironic gesture. “Gentlemen — 
your planet.” 

Warweave was the first to step 
down to the ground, with Detter- 
as close behind, then Kelle. Ger- 
sen followed more slowly. 

The monitor had brought 
them to a spot hardly a hundred 
yards from Lugo Teehalt’s land- 
ing. Gersen thought the land- 
scape even more entrancing than 
the photographs had suggested. 
The air was cool, scented with 
a vaguely herbacious freshness. 
Across the valley, beyond a stand 
of tall dark trees, the hills rose, 
massive yet gentle, marked by 
outcrops of worn gray rock, the 
hollows holding copses of soft 
foliage. Beyond rose a single 
great billowing cloud-castle, 
bright in the noon sunlight. 



Across the meadow, on the far 
side of the river, Gersen saw 
what appeared to be a growth of 
flowering plants and knew them 
to be the dryads. They stood at 
the edge of the forest, swaying on 
supple gray limbs, their move- 
ments easy and graceful. Magni- 
ficent creatures, thought Gersen, 
beyond a doubt — but somehow 
they were a — well, a discordant 
element. A perverse notion, but 
there it was. On tl'eir own plan- 
et they seemed out of place! 
Exotic elements in a scene as 
xiear and beloved as — as what? 
Earth? 

Gersen felt no conscious emo- 
tional attachment for Earth. 
Still, the world most nearly like 
this was Earth i— or, more ac- 
curately, those occasional areas 
of Earth which somehow had 
evaded the artifices and modifi- 
cations wrought by generations 
of man. This world was fresh, 
natural, unmodified. Except for 
the dryads — a jarring note — 
this might 'be Old Earth, Earth 
of the Golden Age, the Earth of 
natural man. 

Gersen felt a small exhilarat- 
ing shock of enlightenment. Here 
resided the basic charm of the 
world: its near-identity to the 
environment in which man had 
evolved. Old Earth must have 
known many such smiling val- 
leys. The feel of such landscapes 
permeated the entire fabric of 



182 



GALAXY 



the human psyche. Other worlds 
of the Oikumene might be pleas- 
ant and comfortable, but none 
were Old Earth; none of them 
were Home. 

For a fact, mused Gersen, here 
is where I would like to build a 
cottage, with an old-fashioned 
garden, an orchard in the mea- 
dow, a rowboat tied to the river- 
bank. Dreams, idle yearning for 
the unattainable. But dreams 
and yearning which necessarily 
must affect every man. 

Gersen blinked at the impact 
of a new thought. Suddenly at- 
tentive, he watched the others. 

'y^T'arweave stood by the river- 
bank frowning down into 
the water. Now he turned and 
shot a suspicious glance toward 
Gersen. 

Kelle, beside a clump of ferns 
as high as his shoulder, looked 
first up to the head of the valley 
with its great white spire of 
cumulus, then down toward the 
far open parkland. The forest at 
either side of the valley formed 
an aisle, continuing till it melted 
and blurred into haze. 

Detteras paced slowly along 
the meadow, hands behind his 
back. Now he bent, scooped up 
a handful of sod, worked it be- 
tween his fingers, let the soil 
sift and fall. He turned to stare 
at the dryads. Kelle did the 
same. 



The dryads, gliding slowly on 
supple legs, moved out of the 
shadows, toward the pool. Their 
fronds shone blue and magenta, 
copper-russet, gold-ocher. Intel- 
ligent beings? 

Gersen turned once more to 
watch the three men. Kelle 
scowled faintly. Warweave in- 
spected the dryads with obvious 
admiration. Detteras suddenly 
put his hands to his mouth and 
shrilled an ear-piercing whistle, 
to which the dryads seemed ob- 
livious. 

There was a sound from the 
ship. Gersen turned to see Pallis 
Atwrode descending the ladder. 
She raised her hands in the sun- 
light, drew a deep breath. 

“What a beautiful valley,” she 
murmured. “Kirth, what a beau- 
tiful valley.” She wandered slow- 
ly away, pausing now and then 
to look around her in delight. 

Gersen, on sudden thought, 
turned and ran back up the lad- 
der into the ship. Rampold — 
where was Rampold? Gersen 
hastened back to the cargo hold. 
Rampold had already entered. 
Gersen advanced cautiously, lis- 
tened. 

Dasce’s voice came gruff, 
hoarse, full of a detestable exul- 
tation. “Rampold, do as I say. 
you hear me?” 

“Yes, Hildemar.” 

“Go to the bulkhead. Unloose 
the cable. Hurry now!” 



THE STAR KING 



183 



Gersen moved to where he 
could look unobserved into the 
hold. Rampold stood not four 
feet from Dasce, staring down 
into the red face. 

“Do you hear me? Hurry, or 
I will cause you to bewail the 
day you were born.” 

Rampold laughed softly, quiet 
ly. “Hildemar, I have asked 
Kirth Gersen for you. I told him 
I would cherish you like a son, I 
would feed you the most nutri- 
tious foods, the most invigorat- 
ing drink. I do not think he 
will give you to me, so I must 
gulp down just a taste of the joy 
I have promised myself for sev- 
enteen years. I am now about to 
beat you to death. This is the 
first opportunity — ” 

Gersen stepped forward. 
“Sorry, Rampold, to interrupt.” 

D ampold uttered an inarticu- 
late cry of utter desolation, 
turned and ran from the hold. 
Gersen followed him. In the en- 
gine room he made a careful ad- 
justment of his projac, thrust it 
into a holster, returned to the 
cargo hold. Dasce bared his teeth 
like a wild animal. 

. “Rampold has no patience.” 
He went to the bulkhead and 
began to unfasten the cable. 

“What are you going to do?” 
Dasce demanded. 

“The orders are that you shall 
be executed.” 

184 



Dasce stared. “What orders?” 

“You fool,” said Gersen. “Can’t 
you guess what’s happened? I’m 
taking your old position.” One 
side of the cable fell free. Ger- 
sen crossed the room. “Don’t 
move unless you want me to 
break your leg.” He unfastened 
the other end of the cable. “Now 
stand up. Walk slowly forward 
and down the ladder. Don’t make 
a single wrong move or I’ll shoot 
you.” 

Dasce rose slowly to his feet. 
Gersen motioned with his projac. 
“Move.” 

Dasce said, “Where are we?” 

“Never mind where we are. 
Move.” 

Dasce slowly turned, and trail- 
ing the two long ends of the 
cable went forward — through 
the engine room, into the saloon, 
to the exit port. Here he hesi- 
tated, looked back over his 
shoulder. “Keep going,” said Ger- 
sen. 

Dasce descended the ladder. 
Gersen, following close, slipped 
on the trailing cable. He jumped 
to the ground and fell heavily, 
flat on his face. Dasce gave a 
wild raucous cry of exultation, 
leapt on him, seized the projac, 
sprang back. 

Gersen slowly rose to his feet, 
backed away. 

“Stop there,” called Dasce, 
“Oho, but I have you now.” He 
glanced around. Fifty feet to one 



GALAXY 



side stood Warweave and Det- 
teras, and slightly behind them 
Kelle. Pressed against the hull 
was Rampold. Dasce flourished 
the projac. “All of you! Stand 
together, while I decide what to 
do. Old Rampold, it’s time he 
was dead. And Gersen, natural- 
ly, in the belly.” He looked to 
where the three from the univer- 
sity stood. “And you — ” he said 
to one of the men — “you play- 
ed me false.” 

Gersen said, “You won’t do 
yourself much good, Dasce.” 

“Oho, I won’t? I hold the 
weapon. There’s three here who 
are going to die. You, old Ram- 
pold, and Grendel.” 

“There’s only a single charge 
in the gun. You may get one of 
us, but the others will get you.” 

Dasce turned a quick look at 
the charge indicator. He laugh- 
ed harshly. “So be it. Who wants 
to die? Or rather, who do I want 
to kill?” He looked from face 
to face. “Old Rampold, I’ve had 
my pleasure from him. Gersen. 
Yes, I’d like to kill you — with 
a red-hot iron in your ear. And 
Grendel. You sly dog, you be- 
trayed me. What your game is 
I don’t know. Why you brought 
me here I don’t know — but 
you’re the one I’m going to kill.” 
He raised the weapon, pointed, 
squeezed the trigger. Energy 
darted from the gun — but not 
the blazing blue bolt. It was only 



a weak pale sizzle. It struck War- 
weave and knocked him to the 
ground. Gersen charged Dasce. 
Instead of fighting, Dasce hurled 
the weapon at Gersen’s head, 
turned and ran up the valley. 
Gersen picked up the projac, 
snapped it open, inserted a fresh 
power-pack. * 

TTe walked slowly forward to 
^ where Warweave was picking 
himself up from the ground. Det- 
teras barked at Gersen, “You 
must be a moron allowing such 
a man to take your gun.” 

Kelle spoke in a puzzled voice, 
“But why shoot Gyle Warweave? 
Is he a maniac?” 

Gersen said, “I suggest we go 
back into the ship, where Mr. 
Warweave can rest. There was 
only a small charge in the gun, 
but no doubt it hurt.” 

Detteras grunted, turned to- 
ward the ship. Kelle took War- 
weave’s arm; but Warweave 
shook him off and lurched up 
the accommodation ladder, fol- 
lowed by Detteras and Kelle, 
and finally Gersen. 

Gersen asked Warweave, “Are 
you feeling better now?” 
“Yes,” said Warweave in a 
cold voice. “But I agree with 
Detteras. You displayed the ut- 
most folly.” 

“I’m not so sure as to that,” 
said Gersen. “I carefully ar- 
ranged the whole affair.” 



THE STAR KING 



185 



Detteras gaped at him stupid- 
ly. “Purposely?” 

“I shorted out the projac, I 
arranged that Dasce could seize 
it, I informed him that there was 
a single charge left — so that he 
could verify my own conviction 
regarding the identity of Gren- 
del.” 

“Grendel?” Kelle and Detter- 
as stared blankly at Gersen. 
Warweave watched him narrow- 
eyed. 

“Grendel the Monster. I’ve 
watched Mr. Warweave a long 
time, suspecting that he should 
more properly be known as 
Grendel.” 

“This is lunacy,” gasped Det- 
teras. “Are you serious?” 
“Certainly I’m serious. It had 
to be either you, Warweave or 
Kelle. I picked Warweave.” 
“Indeed,” said Warweave. 
“May I ask why?” 

“Of course. First of all I dis- 
missed Detteras. He is an ugly 
man. Star Kings are more care- 
ful with their physiognomy.” 
“Star Kings?” blurted Detter- 
as. “Who? Warweave? What 
nonsense!” 

“Detteras likewise is a good 
eater, while Star Kings eat hu- 
man food with disgust. As for 
Mr. Kelle, I also thought him an 
unlikely candidate. He is short 
and round — again not the phys- 
iognomy characteristic of a Star 
King.” 



Warweave’s face twisted in a 
glacial smile. “You imply that 
a good appearance guarantees 
depravity of character?” 

“No. I imply that Star Kings 
seldom leave their planet unless 
they can compete successfully 
against true men. Now, two oth- 
er points. Kelle is married and 
has bred at least one daughter. 
Secondly, Kelle and Detteras 
have legitimate careers at the 
university. You are Honorary 
Provost and I remember some- 
thing to the effect that a large 
endowment brought you the 
job. 

“This is insanity,” declared 
Detteras. “Warweave as Grendel 
the Monster. And a Star King to 
boot!” 

“It’s a fact,” said Gersen. 

“And what do you propose to 
do?” 

“Kill him.” 

T'Vetteras stared, then lunged 
forward, roaring in triumph 
as he grappled Gersen, only to 
grunt as Gersen twisted, swung 
an elbow and struck with the 
butt of the projac. Detteras reel- 
ed back. 

“I want the cooperation of you 
and Mr. Kelle,” said Gersen. 

“Cooperate with a lunatic? 
Never!” 

“Warweave is frequently ab- 
sent from the university for long 
periods. Am I right? And one 



186 



GALAXY 



of these periods was only recent- 
ly. Right?” 

Detteras set his jaw. “I’ll say 
nothing about that.” 

“This is true enough,” said 
Kelle uneasily. He glanced side- 
wise at Warweave, then back to 
Gersen. “I assume you have 
strong reasons for your accusa- 
tion.” 

“Certainly.” 

“I’d like to hear some of these 
reasons.” 

“They make a long story. It’s 
enough to say that I tracked 
Grendel to the Sea Province 
University and narrowed the 
possibilities to you three. I sus- 
pected Warweave almost from 
the first, but I never was certain 
until the three of you stepped 
out on this planet.” 

“This is sheer farce,” sighed 
Warweave wearily. 

“This planet is like Earth — 
an Earth that no man alive has 
ever known; an Earth which 
hasn’t existed for ten thousand 
years. Kelle and Detteras were 
entranced. Kelle drank in the 
view, Detteras reverently felt the 
soil. Warweave went to look in- 
to the water: and Star Kings 
evolved from amphibious lizards 
who lived in wet holes. The 
dryads appeared. Warweave ad- 
mired them, seemed to consider 
them ornamental. To Kelle and 
Detteras — and to myself — they 
are intruders. Detteras whistled 



at them, Kelle scowled, for we 
men don’t want fantastic crea- 
tures on a world so dear to us. 
But all this is theorizing. After 
I managed to capture Hildemar 
Dasce I went to great lengths to 
convince him that Grendel was 
his betrayer. When I gave him 
the chance he identified War- 
weave — with the projac.” 
Warweave shook his head pity- 
ingly. “I deny all your allega- 
tions.” He looked to Kelle. “Do 
you believe me?” . 

Kelle pursed his lips. “Con- 
found it, Gyle, I’ve come to re- 
gard Gersen as a competent man. 
I don’t believe him to be either 
irresponsible or a lunatic.” 
Warweave turned to Detteras. 
“Rundle — what of you?” 
Detteras rolled up his eyes. “I 
am a rational man. I can’t have 
blind faith — in you, in Gersen 
or anyone else. Gersen has made 
a case. Astonishing as it is, facts 
seem to bear him out. Can you 
demonstrate to the contrary?” 
Warweave considered. “I be- 
lieve so.” He strolled to the shelf 
below which Suthiro had install- 
ed the switch. The inhalator he 
had worn outside dangled from 
his hand. “Yes,” said Warweave, 
“I believe I can make a con- 
vincing case for myself.” He 
pressed the inhalator to his face, 
touched the switch. At once the 
air pollution alarm sounded: a 
racuous loud clanging. 



THE STAR KING 



187 



CCTf you turn back the switch,” 
Gersen called out, “the noise 
will stop.” 

Warweave numbly reached be- 
low the shelf and reversed the 
switch. 

Gersen turned to Kelle and 
Detteras. “Warweave is as sur- 
prised as you. He thought that 
the switch controlled the gas 
reservoirs which you will find 
under the settees, hence his use 
of the inhalator. I emptied the 
tanks and changed the leads to 
connect the switch to an alarm.” 

Kelle looked under the settee, 
brought forth the canister. He 
looked at Warweave. “Well, 
Gyle?” 

Warweave tossed aside the in- 
halator, turned his back in dis- 
gust. 

Detteras suddenly roared. 
“Warweave! Let’s have the 
truth!” 

Warweave spoke over his 
shoulder. “You’ve heard the 
truth, from Gersen.” 

“You are Grendel?” said Det- 
teras in a hushed voice. 

“Yes.” Warweave wheeled 
about, drew himself up to his 
full height. His black eyes glared 
back and forth. “And I am a Star 
King, superior to men!” 

“A man has defeated you,” 
said Kelle. 

Warweave’s eyes burnt even 
brighter. He turned to consider 
Gersen. “I am curious. Ever since 



your encounter with Lugo Tee- 
halt you have sought Grendel. 
Why?” 

“Grendel is one of the Demon 
Princes. I plan to kill them.” 

Warweave thought a moment. 
“You are an ambitious man,” he 
said in a neutral voice. “There 
are not many like you.” 

“There were not many survi- 
vors of the raid on Mount Pleas- 
ant. My grandfather was one. I 
was another.” 

“Indeed,” said Warweave. 
“The Mount Pleasant raid. So 
long ago.” 

“This is a peculiar voyage,” 
said Kelle, whose attitude had 
become one of wry detachment. 
“At least we have achieved our 
purpose. The planet exists. It is 
as Mr. Gersen described it, and 
the money in escrow becomes his 
property.” 

“Not until we return to Al- 
phanor,” growled Detteras. 

Gersen spoke to Warweave. 
“You have taken great pains to 
secure this world for yourself. I 
wonder why.” 

Warweave shrugged noncom- 
mittally. 

“A man might want to live 
here, or build himself a palace,” 
suggested. Gersen. “A Star King 
wants none of these things.” 

Warweave said presently, 
“You make a common mistake. 
Men are after all quite parochial. 
You forget that individual dif- 



188 



GALAXY 



erences exist among folk other 
than yourselves. Some perhaps 
are denied the freedom of their 
own worlds. They become ‘rene- 
gade’: neither man nor their own 
kind. The folk of Ghnarumen — ” 
he easily used the name which 
sounded like a cough — are 
quite as orderly as the most law- 
abiding folk of the Oikumene. 
In short, the career of Grendel 
is not one which the folk of 
Ghnarumen would care to emu- 
late. They may be right, they 
may be wrong. It is my~preroga- 
tive to organize my own style of 
life. As you know, the Star Kings 
are strongly competitive. This 
world, to men, is beautiful. I find 
it pleasant enough. I plan to 
bring here folk of my race, to 
nurture them on a world more 
beautiful than Earth, to father a 
world and a people, superior to 
both men and the people of 
Ghnarumen. This was my hope, 
which you will not understand, 
for there can be no such under- 
standing between your race and 
mine.” 

T'Vetteras said between clench- 
ed teeth. “But you took 
advantage of our liberality to 
dishonor us. If Gersen doesn’t 
kill you, I will.” 

“Neither of you will kill Gren- 
del the Star King.” Two steps 
took him to the exit port. Det- 
teras lunged after him, frustrat- 



ing Gersen’s attempt to use his 
projac. Warweave turned, lashed 
out with his foot, kicked Detter- 
as in the stomach, jumped to 
the ground and ran off down 
the slope. 

Gersen stepped to the exit 
port. He sent a bolt of energy 
unsuccessfully after the bound- 
ing figure, descended the ladder 
and gave chase. 

Warweave reached the mea- 
dow. He hesitated at the edge 
of the river, looked back at Ger- 
sen, continued down the valley. 
Gersen kept to the upper slopes 
where the ground was hard, and 
began to gain on Warweave, who 
had come to a marshy area. War- 
weave once more went to the 
river-bank and hesitated. If he 
plunged in, before he gained the 
opposite shore Gersen would be 
upon him. He looked back over 
his shoulder. 

His face was no longer that of 
a man; Gersen wondered how 
he could have been fooled, even 
for an instant. Warweave turned, 
uttered a cry in a slurred gut- 
tural language, went to his knees 
and disappeared. 

Gersen, reaching the spot, 
found a hole in the river-bank 
almost two feet across. He bent 
to peer in, but saw nothing. Det- 
teras and Kelle ran up, panting. 
“Where is he?” 

Gersen pointed to the burrow. 
“According to Lugo Teehalt, 



THE STAR KING 



189 



large white grubs live under the 
marsh.” 

“Hmf,” said Detteras. “His an- 
cestors evolved in the swamps 
in just such holes. He probably 
couldn’t want a better haven.” 
Kelle said dubiously, “He’ll 
have to come out — to eat.” 
“I’m not so sure. The Star 
Kings dislike human food. Men 
find the Star King diet equally 
repellent. We cultivate plants 
and domesticate animals; they 
do similarly for worms and in- 
sects, such things as that. War- 
weave should do quite well on 
what he finds underground.” 
Gersen looked up the valley 
where Hildemar Dasce had fled. 
“I’ve lost them both. I was will- 
ing to sacrifice Dasce to get 
Grendel — but both. .” 

The three stood on the river- 
bank. A breeze rippled the sur- 
face of the water, moved the 
branchs of the great dark trees 
which grew at the base of the 
hills. A tribe of dryads wander- 
ing along the opposite shore 
turned their purple-green eye- 
smudges on the men. 

Gersen said, “Perhaps it’s just 
as bad, leaving them together on 
this planet, as killing them.” 
“Worse,” said Detteras devout- 
ly. “Worse by far.” 

Hphey returned slowly to the 
-*■ ship. Pallis Atwrode, sitting on 
the turf, rose to her feet as Ger- 



sen approached. She came over 
to him, took his arm, smiled up 
into his face. “Kirth, I like it 
here, don’t you?” 

“Yes, Pallis, very much.” 
“Imagine!” said Pallis. “A 
pretty house up there on the hill, 
like old Sir Morton Hodenfroe’s 
house on Blackstone Edge. 
Wouldn’t that be nice, Kirth? I 
wonder. I wonder. .” 

“First we must return to Al- 
phanor, Pallis. Then we’ll talk 
about coming back.” 

“Very well, Kirth. Do you 
know, I’ve had the most horrible 
dream.” She sobbed, clutched at 
him. He put his arms around 
her, patted her head and shoul- 
ders. 

Detteras said gruffly, “Well, 
Gersen, you’ve made use of Kelle 
and myself in a most cavalier 
fashion. I can’t say that I enjoy 
it,' but I can’t bring myself to 
resent it either.” 

Robin Rampold approached 
slowly, keeping to the shadow of 
the ship. “Hildemar ran away,” 
he said mournfully. “Now he 
will make over the mountains to 
town and I will never seen him 
again.” 

“He can make over the moun- 
tains,” said Gersen, “but he won’t 
find any towns.” 

“I have been watching up 
along the hillside, and through 
the forest,” said Rampold. “I 
think he is somewhere nearby.”

GALAXY 



“Very likely,” said Gersen. 

“It is distressing,” said Ram- 
pold. “It is enough to sadden a 
man.” 

Gersen laughed. “You would 
prefer to be back in the cage?” 
“No, of course not. But then I 
had my dreams of what I would 
do when I won free. Seventeen 
years of hopes and dreams! But 
now I am free and Hildemar is 
beyond my reach.” He moved 
disconsolately away. 

After a pause Kelle said, “As 
a scientist I find this planet a 
place of fascination. As a man 
I find it entrancing. As Kagge 
Kelle, erstwhile colleague of 
Gyle Warweave — I find it ex- 
tremely depressing. I am pre- 
pared to leave at any time.” 
“Yes,” said Detteras in a gruff 
voice. “Why not?” 

Gersen looked up the valley to 
where Hildemar Dasce, wearing 
only soiled white pantaloons, 
lurked in the forest like a raging 
desperate beast. He looked down 
the valley, far down over the 
hazy plain, then back to the 
swampy meadow, under which 
crawled Grendel the Monster. He 
looked down into the face of 
Pallis Atwrode. She was watch- 
ing him. “Was it real, Kirth? 
What happened?” 

“Yes. But it’s all over.” 

“I’ve been. .” She hesitated, 
frowned. “I don’t remember too 
much.” 



“Just as well.” 

“Look, Kirth, what are those 
beautiful creatures?” 

“Dryads.” 

“What are they doing?” 

“I don’t know. Looking for 
something to eat, I suppose. Lugo 
Teehalt says they suck up nour- 
ishment from big grubs which 
burrow under the meadow. Or 
perhaps they lay eggs in the 
soil.” 

The dryads, wandering up the 
shore, flourished their gorgeous 
fronds, swaying slowly like 
branches in the wind. On the 
swamp they moved more slowly, 
a step at a time. One of them 
stopped, stood stock-still. Under 
its foot showed a glint of white, 
as the concealed proboscis 
plunged down into the soft 
ground. A few seconds passed. 
The ground heaved, erupted : the 
dryad toppled over backward. 

Up from a crater staggered 
Warweave, the proboscis still 
thrust through his back. His face 
was stained with dirt, his eyes 
started from his head; from his 
mouth issued a series of appall- 
ing cries. He shook himself, fell 
to his knees, rolled over, disen- 
gaged himself from the flutter- 
ing dryad, jumped erect, ran 
crazily up the hillside. His steps 
flagged. 

He fell to his knees, clutched 
at the ground, kicked and lay 
still. 



THE STAR KING

G yle Warweave was buried on 
the hillside. The group re- 
turned to the ship. Robin Ram- 
pold now diffidently approach- 
ed Gersen. “I have made up my 
mind to stay here.” 

In one part of his brain Ger- 
sen was shocked and astonished. 
In another part there was only 
confirmation of a previous ex- 
pectation. “So,” said Gersen 
heavily, “you expect to live on 
this planet with Hildemar 
Dasce.” 

“Yes.” 

“Do you know what will hap- 
pen? He will make you his slave. 
Or he will kill you for the food 
which I shall be bound to leave 
you.” 

Rarnpold’s face was bleak and 
drawn. “It may be as you say. 
But I cannot leave Hildemar 
Dasce.” 

“Think,” said Gersen. “You 
will be here alone. He will be 
more savage than ever before.” 
“I hope that you will leave 
me certain articles. A weapon, a 
shovel, a few tools to build a 
shelter, some food.” 

“And what will you do when 
the food runs out?” 

“I will look for natural food. 
Seeds, fish, nuts, roots. These 
may be poisonous, but I will test 
them carefully. And what else 
is left for me?” 

Gersen shook his head. “Far 
better that you return with us to 



Alphanor. Hildemar Dasce will 
take senseless but terrible ven- 
geance on you.” 

Robin Rampold said, “It is a 
chance I must take.” 

“As you wish.” 

The ship lifted from the mea- 
dow, leaving Rampold standing 
beside his meager stack of sup- 
plies. 

The horizons spread out. The 
planet became a green and blue 
ball and fell astern. Gersen turn- 
ed to Kelle and Detteras. “Well, 
gentlemen, you have visited Tee- 
halt’s planet.” 

“Yes,” said Kelle tonelessly. 
“By a roundabout method you 
have fulfilled the terms of your 
agreement with us, the money 
is yours.” 

Gersen shook his head. “I 
don’t want the money. I suggest 
that we keep the existence of 
this planet secret, to preserve it 
from what could only be dese- 
cration.” 

“Very well,” said Kelle. “I’m 
agreed.” 

“I agree,” said Detteras, “pro- 
vided that I may return another 
time, under more relaxing condi- 
tions.” 

“This is what I wish to do my- 
self,” said Gersen. 

“Can we build a house, 
Kirth?” asked Pallis Atwrode. 
“A pretty little house with steep 
gables?” 

“If you like.”

\ year later Kirth Gersen re- 
turned alone to Teehalt’s 
planet in his old Model 9B space- 
boat. 

Hanging in space he examined 
the valley by macroscope, but 
discovered no signs of life. There 
was now a projac on the planet 
and it might well be in the hands 
of Hildemar Dasce. He waited 
till nightfall and landed the boat 
on a shelf in the mountains 
above the river valley. 

The long quiet night came to 
an end. At dawn Gersen started 
down the valley, keeping always 
to the shelter of the trees. 

From far off he heard the 
sound of an axe. With great care 
he approached the sound. 

On the edge of the forest Robin 
Rampold chopped at a fallen 
tree. Gersen stealthily moved 
closer. Rampold’s face had filled 
out. He looked bronzed and 
strong and fit. Gersen called his 
name. Rampold looked up, star- 
tled, searching the dark shadows. 
“Who is there?” 

“Kirth Gersen.” 

“Come forth, come forth. No 
need to steal up so furtively.” 
Gersen moved to the edge of 
the forest, looked carefully all 
around. “I feared I might find 
Hildemar Dasce.” 

“Ah,” said Rampold. “No need 
to worry about Hildemar.” 

“He is dead?” 

“No. He is quite alive, in a 



little pen I built for him. With 
your permission, I will not take 
you to see him, as the pen is in 
a private spot, well hidden from 
any who might visit the planet.” 
“I see,” said Gersen. “You de- 
feated Dasce then.” 

“Of course. Did you ever doubt 
it? I have much more resource 
than Dasce. I dug a pit during 
the night, built a deadfall. In the 
morning Hildemar Dasce swag- 
gered forth, hoping to confiscate 
my stores. He fell into it, and 
I took him captive. Already he 
has become a changed man.” He 
looked closely into Gersen’s face. 
“You do not approve?” 

Gersen shrugged. “I came to 
take you back to the Oikumene.” 
“No,” said Rampold. “Never 
fear for me. I will live out my 
days here, with Hildemar Dasce. 
It is a beautiful planet. I have 
found sufficient food to main- 
tain us, and daily I demonstrate 
to Hildemar Dasce the tricks and 
conceits he taught me long ago.” 
They wandered down the val- 
ley to the previous landing place. 
“The life-cycle here is strange,” 
said Rampold. “Each form 
changes into another, endlessly. 
Only the trees are permanent.” 
“So I learned from the man 
who first found the planet.” 
“Come, I’ll show you War- 
weave’s grave.” Rampold led the 
way up the slope, to a copse of 
slender white-timbered trees. To 



THE STAR KING

the side grew a seedling, rather 
different from the rest. The 
trunk was veined with purple, 
the leaves were dark-green and 
leathery. Rampold pointed. 
“There rests Gyle Warweave.” 

Gersen looked a moment, then 
turned away. He gazed up and 
down the valley. It was as beau- 
tiful and placid and quiet as be- 
fore. “Well, then,” said Gersen. 
“I will once more depart. I may 
never return. Are you sure you 
wish to stay?” 

“Absolutely.” Rampold looked 
up at the sun. “But I am late. 
Hildemar will be expecting me. 
A pity to disappoint him. I will 



bid you farewell now.” He bow- 
ed and departed, crossing the 
valley and disappearing into the 
forest. 

Gersen once more looked up 
and down the valley. The world 
was no longer innocent; it had 
known evil. A sense of tarnish 
lay across the panorama. Gersen 
sighed, turned and stood looking 
down at what had become Gyle 
Warweave’s grave. 

He bent, seized the seedling, 
pulled it from the soil, broke 
it, cast it aside. Then he turned 
and walked up the valley toward 
his space-boat.

FORECAST 



The first step in writing a science-fiction story is to guess what 
major developments in science may change the shape of tomorrow. How- 
ever, we ask more from our writers than that. We ask them not merely to 
suggest what specific inventions or discoveries the future may hold, but to 
tell us what's going to follow from them. We ask them, in short, to do 
our imagining for us— and to do it in detail. 

Of all science-fiction writers, the one whose vision ranges farthest 
into the totality of the life of the future is a fellow named Cordwainer 
Smith. Cordwainer Smith doesn't write stories about interstellar travel, 
or longevity, or the relationship between future humans and their robot 
or mutated animal creations; what he writes about is people, in a culture 
where all of these things and much more are the stuff of their daily lives. 

Such a story is The Boy Who Bought Old Earth, a short novel com- 
plete in the next issue of Galaxy. The world Smith describes in it is probably 
not the world you would guess as a probable future for us . but it is 
consistent ... it is logical ... it is challenging, fascinating, exciting . 
it is, in short, a typical Cordwainer Smith story, and we recommend it.

other more clearly. Parents find Graphoanalysis 
invaluable in helping them understand and guide 
their children. And many intelligent people, with 
or without problems. G raphoannlyze their own 
handwriting in order to see themselves objectively. 

Maybe you have never beard of Graphoanalysis 
as it is a relatively new psychological technique. So 
it should In? explained that Graphoanalysis is not 
occult graphology and has nothing at all to do 
with fortune-telling. It is a rapidly growing scien- 
tific procedure, already proved and tested. 

Its growth during the past few years has been 
spectacular, even exceeding the growth of other 
forms of psychological testing, which have l>een
