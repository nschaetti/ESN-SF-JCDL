Do you have 
a restless urge 
to write? 



If you do, here is an opportunity 
for you to take the first 
important step to success in writing 




Bennett Cerf, the distinguished 
publisher, is a member of 
the Guiding Faculty of 
the Famous Writers School. 



There’s something different nboul peo- 
ple who feel the urge to write. They have 
a spiritual hunger that sets them apart — 
even from family and friends. 

If you have known this burning need 
to write, you, too, may have the gift suc- 
cessful authors possess. 

They know that this restless urge for 
self-expression is perhaps the most im- 
portant ingredient of writing success. 
But, they realize it can waste away if 
you don't know how to get started writ- 
ing, or if you hesitate to try. 

Several years ago a group of famous 
authors including Rod Serling, Faith 
Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, Bruce Catton, 
and several others joined forces to start 
the Famous Writers School. They poured 
everything they know about writing into 
;i remarkable new kind of professional 
training course which trains you at home 
in your spare time. You begin with the 
fundamentals of all good writing. Then 
you get advanced training in the specialty 
of your choice. 

Each of your assignments is examined 
by an instructor who is a professional 
writer or editor. He goes over your work 
word by word, blue-penciling changes 
right on your manuscript. Then he re- 
turns it to you with a long letter of ad- 



vice on how to improve your writing. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to hundreds of 
publications. 

Free Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you, too, have writing 
ability worth developing, send for the 
School’s revealing Aptitude Test. If you 
test well, or offer other evidence of writ- 
ing aptitude — you may enroll. However, 
there is no obligation to do so.

SUNPOT 



The word looks like something 
you might have seen before. So 
does the phenomenon it describes. 
Turn to page 142 for its first ex- 
pression. Kick it around but don’t 
jump to conclusions. 

Hit the student road. Ethnology 
can and should be as precise as 
any of the physical sciences says 
Claude Levi-Strauss, anthropolo- 
gist and founder and leading ex- 
ponent of Structuralism — and 1 
believe. You can’t begin to ima- 
gine how hard 1 believe. The only 
valid distinction between societies, 
again says Claude Levi-Strauss, 
is that some have a written lan- 
guage and hence a history and 
others don’t. And there, in a nut- 
shell, you have all the campus 
riots. 

Today we study the New Peo- 
ple — the young have always be- 
longed to their own ethnic. To- 
day’s young adults in addition 
have their own distinctive lan- 
guage — verbal and hieroglyphic — 
and they’re rapidly writing history. 

Vaughn Bode, who also looks 
(see top right) like something you 
might have seen before — but don’t 
bet that you have — says, “The 
monolithic awareness of youth stirs 
and rises up greatly and powerful- 
ly. I am awash on a new shore and 
I am at home with the New Peo- 
ple. My acceptance is running like 
a fast tide ... I want to do many 
things with my life but mostly I 
want to share the places deep in 




my head with readers everywhere.’’ 
Sunpot, a new illustrated feature 
created and produced entirely by 
Vaughn Bod6, will appear exclu- 
sively and monthly in Galaxy 
Magazine beginning with the Jan- 
uary, 1970 issue. Vaughn, a licens- 
ed small-plane pilot and para- 
chutist, young father. Under- 
ground artist and commercial art 
director, window washer and this 
year’s Hugo winner, will com- 
municate in Sunpot in the picture- 
writing language of the young 
adults of today. He rules his own 
galaxy of “little worlds ... I use 
them to reflect the harsh realities 
that all of us must march.” 

Vaughn will do his thing. Not I 
nor anyone else on the staff of this 
magazine will control what it is. I 
will comment on it on these pages 
if 1 have to — you may comment on 
it wherever you like. 

We’re going to be seeing the 
unpredictable — perhaps even by 
Vaughn Bode. It is possible that 
not even Bode has seen all of Bode 
before. — JAKOBSSON

Pop glared and Mother 
was all steamed up 
about the adults who 
would not be ! 



JACK WILLIAMSON 




T he scoutmaster slipped into 
the camp on black plastic 
tracks. Its slick yellow hood shone 
in the cold early light like the 
shell of a bug. It paused in the 
door, listening for boys not asleep. 
Then its glaring eyes began to 
swivel, darting red beams into 
every corner, looking for boys out 
of bed. 

“Rise and smile!” Its merry 
voice bounced off the gray iron 
walls. “Fox Troop rise and smile! 
Hop for old Pop! Mother says to- 
day is Jamboree!” 

The Nuke Patrol, next to the 
door, was mostly tenderfeet, still 
in their autonomic prams. They 
all began squalling. They had not 
yet learned to love old Pop. The 
machine’s happy voice rose 
louder than their howling. It came 
fast down the narrow aisle to the 
cubs in the Anthrax Patrol. 

“Hop for Pop. Mother says it’s 
Jamboree.” 

The cubs jumped to attention, 
squealing with delight. Jamboree 
was bright gold stars to paste on 
their faces. Jamboree was a whole 
scoop of pink ice milk and maybe 
a natural apple. Jamboree was a 
visit to Mother’s. 

The older scouts in the Scaven- 
ger Patrol and the Skull Patrol 
were not so noisy. They knew 
Mother would not have many 
more Jamborees for them. At the 
far end of the camp three boys sat 
up without a sound and looked at 




\

Joey’s empty pallet wonderingly. 

“Joey’s late,’’ Ratbait whis- 
pered. He was a pale, scrawny, 
wise-eyed scout who looked too 
old for twelve. “We oughta save 
his hide. We oughta fix a dummy 
and fool old Pop.” 

“Naw,” muttered Butch. “He’ll 
get us all in bad.” 

“But we oughta — ” Blinkie 
wheezed. “We oughta help — ” 

Ratbait began to wad up a pil- 
low to be the dummy’s head. He 
dropped flat when they saw the 
scoutmaster rushing down with a 
noise like wind, red lamps 
stabbing at the empty bed. 

“Now, now, scouts — ” Its voice 
fluttered like a hurt bird. “You 
can’t play pranks on poor old Pop. 
Not today. You’ll make us late for 
Jamboree.” 

Ratbait felt a steel whip twitch 
the blanket from over his head 
and saw red light burning through 
his tightly shut lids. 

“Better wake up. Scout R- 
eight.” The smooth, sad voice 
dripped over him like warm oil. 
“Better tell old Pop where J-O 
went.” 

Ratbait squirmed under that 
terrible blaze. He was unable to 
see, unable to Ixeathe and he 
could think nothing to say. He 
gulped at the taste of terror in his 
throat and tried to shake his head. 
At last the red glare went on to 
Blinkie. 

“Scout Q-Two, you’re a twenty- 
badger.” The low, slow voice 



licked at Blinkie like a friendly 
pup. “You like to help old Pop 
keep a tidy camp for Mother. 
You’ll tell us where J-O went.” 
Blinkie was a fattish boy. His 
puffy face was toadstool-pale and 
his pallet had a sour smell from 
being wet. He sat up and ducked 
back from the steel whip over 
him. 

“Please d-d-d-d-d — ” 

A wheezy stammer stalled his 
voice and he failed to dodge the 
bright whip that looped around 
him and dragged him up to the 
heat and the hum and the hot oil 
smell of Pop’s yellow hood. 

“Well, Scout Q-Two?” 

Blinkie gasped and stuttered 
and finally sagged against the plas- 
tic tracks like gray jelly. The shin- 
ing coils rippled around him like 
thin snakes, constricting. His 
breath wheezed out and his fat 
arm jerked up, pointing at a black 
sign on the wall: 

DANGER! 

POWER ACCESS 
ROBOTS ONL'iCr’"^" 

The whips tossed him back on 
his sour pallet. He lay panting and 
blinking and dodging even after 
the whips were gone. The scout- 
master’s eyes flashed to the sign 
and the square grating under it, 
swiveled back to Butch. 

Butch was a slow, stocky, bug- 
eyed boy, young enough to come 
back from another Jamboree. He 



6 



GALAXY 



had always been afraid of Pop but 
he wanted to be the new leader 
of Skull Patrol in Joey’s place and 
now he thought he saw his chance. 

“Don't hit me. Pop!” His 
voice squeaked and his face 
turned red. He scrambled off his 
pallet without waiting for the 
whips. “I’ll tell on Joey. I been 
wantin’ all along to tell but I was 
afraid they’d beat me.” 

“Good boy.” The scoutmaster’s 
loud words swelled out like big 
soap-bubbles bursting in the sun. 
“Mother wants to know all about 
Scout J-O.” 

“He pries that grating — ” 
Butch’s voice quavered and caught 
when he saw the look on Ratbait’s 
face but when he turned to Pop 
it came back fast. “Does it every 
night. Since three Jamborees ago. 
Sneaks down into the pits where 
the robots work. I dunno why, ex- 
cept he sees somebody there. And 
brings things back. Things he 
shouldn’t have. Things like this.” 
He fumbled in his uniform and 
held up a metal tag. 

“This is your good turn today, 
Scout X-six.” The thin tip of a 
whip took the tag and dangled it 
“Whose tag is this?” 

Butch’s voice dried up when he 
saw Ratbait’s pale lips making 
words without a sound. 

“What’s so much about an ID 
tag?” Ratbait asked. “Anyhow, 
what were you doing in Joey’s 
bed.” 

“It’s funny.” Butch looked away 



and squeaked at Pop. “A girl’s 
number.” 

T he silent shock of that 
bounced off the iron walls, was 
somehow louder than old Pop’s 
boom. Most of the scouts had 
never seen a girl. After a long 
time the cubs near the door began 
to whisper and titter. 

“Shhhhh!” Pop roared like 
steam. “Now we can ail do a good 
turn for Mother. And play a 
little joke on Scout J-O! He didn’t 
know today would be Jamboree 
but he’ll find out.” Pop laughed 
like a heavy chain clanking. “Back 
to bed! Quiet as robots!” 

Pop rolled close to the wall 
near the power-pit grating and 
the boys lay back on their pallets. 
Once Ratbait caught his breath to 
yell but he saw Butch’s bug-eyes 
watching. Pop’s hum sank, and 
even the tenderfeet in their 
prams were quiet. 

Ratbait heard the grating creak. 
He saw Joey’s head, tangled yel- 
low hair streaked with oil and 
dust. He frowned and shook his 
head and saw Joey’s sky-blue eyes 
go wide. 

Joey tried to duck but the quick 
whips caught his neck. They 
dragged him out of the square 
black pit and swung him like a 
puppet toward old Pop’s eyes. 

“Well, Scout J-O!” Pop laughed 
like thick oil bubbling. “Mother 
wants to know where you’ve 
been.”

Joey fell on his face when the 
whip uncoiled but he scrambled to 
his feet. He gave Ratbait a pale 
grin before he looked up at Pop 
but he didn’t say anything. 

“Better tell old Pop the truth.” 
The slick whips drew back like 
lean snakes about to strike. “Or 
else we’ll have to punish you, 
Scout J-O.” 

Joey shook his head and the 
whips went to work. Still he didn’t 
speak. He didn’t even scream. But 
something fell out of his torn uni- 
form. The whip-tips snatched it 
from the floor. 

“What’s this thing. Scout J-O?” 
The whip-fingers turned it deli- 
cately under the furious eyes and 
nearly dropped it again. “Scout 
J-O, this is a book.” 

Silence echoed in the iron 
camp. 

“Scout J-O, you’ve stolen a 
book.” Pop’s shocked voice 
changed into a toneless buzz, 
reading the title. "Operators’ 
Handbook, Nuclear Reactor, 
Series 9-Z." 

Quiet sparks of fear crackled 
through the camp. Two or three 
tenderfeet began sobbing in their 
prams. When they were quiet old 
Pop made an ominous, throat- 
clearing sound. 

“Scout J-O, what are you doing 
with a book?” 

Joey gulped and bit his under- 
lip till blood seeped down his 
chin but he made no sound. Old 
Pop rolled closer, while the busy 



whips were stowing the book into 
a dark compartment under the 
yellow hood. 

“Mother won’t like this.” Each 
word clinked hard, like iron on 
iron. “Books aren’t for boys. 
Books are for robots only. Don’t 
you know that?” 

Joey stood still. 

“This hurts me. Scout J-O.” 
Pop’s voice turned downy soft, 
the slow words like tears of sad- 
ness now. “It hurts your poor 
Mother. More than anything can 
ever hurt you.” 

The whips cracked and cracked 
and cracked. At last they picked 
him up and shook him and 
dropped him like a red-streaked 
rag on the floor. Old Pop backed 
away and wheeled around. 

“Fox Troop rise and smile!” 
Its roaring voice turned jolly 
again, as if it had forgotten Joey. 
“Hop for Pop. Today is Jamboree 
and we’re on our way to visit 
Mother. Fall out in marching or- 
der.” 

The cubs twittered with ex- 
citement until their leaders 
threatened to keep them home 
from Jamboree but at last old Pop 
led the troop out of camp and 
down the paved trail toward 
Mother’s. Joey limped from the 
whips but he set his teeth and 
kept his place at the head of his 
patrol. 

Marching through boy terri- 
tory, they passed the scattered 
camps of troops whose Jamborees 



8 



GALAXY 



came on other days. A few scouts 
were out with their masters but 
nobody waved or even looked 
straight at them. 

The spring sun was hot and 
Pop’s pace was too fast for the 
cubs. Some of them began to 
whimper and fall out of line. Pop 
rumbled back to warn them that 
Mother would give no gold stars 
if they were late for Jamboree. 

When Pop was gone Joey 
glanced at Ratbait and beckoned 
with his head. 

“I gotta get away,” he whis- 
pered low and fast. “I gotta get 
back to the pits — ” 

Butch ran out of his place, lean- 
ing to listen. Ratbait shoved him 
off the trail. 

“You gotta help,” Joey gasped. 
“There’s a thing we gotta do — an’ 
we gotta do it now. This will be 
the last Jamboree for most of us. 
We’ll never get another chance.” 

Butch came panting along the 
edge of the trail, trying to hear. 
Blinkie got in his way. 

“What’s all this?” Ratbait 
breathed. “What you gonna do?” 

“It’s all in the book,” Joey said. 
“Something called manual over- 
ride. There’s a dusty room — down 
under Mother’s — back of a peo- 
ple-only sign. Two red buttons. 
Two big levers. With a glass wall 
between. It takes two people.” 

“Who?” Joey gulped. “One of 
us?” 

Joey shook his head, waiting for 
Blinkie to elbow Butch. 



“I got a friend. We been work- 
ing together down in the pits. 
Watching the robots. Reading the 
books. Learning what we gotta 
do—” 

He glanced back. Blinkie was 
scuffling with Butch to keep him 
busy but now the scoutmaster 
came clattering back from the 
rear, booming merrily, “Hop for 
Pop! Hop a lot for Pop!” 

“How you gonna work it?” 
Alarm took Ratbait’s breath. “Now 
the robots will be watching — ” 

“We got a back door.” Joey’s 
whisper raced. “A drainage tun- 
nel. Hot water out of the reactor. 
Comes out under Black Creek 
bridge. My friend will be there. If 
I can dive off this end of the 
bridge — ” 

“Hey, Pop!” Butch was scream- 
ing. “Ratbait’s talking! Blinkie 
pushed me! Joey’s planning some- 
thing bad!” 

“Good boy. Scout X-six!” Pop 
slowed beside him. “Mother wants 
to know if they’re plotting more 
mischief.” 

W HEN Pop rolled on ahead of 
the troop, Ratbait wondered 
what would ' happen when Joey 
and his friend pushed the two red 
buttons and pulled the two big 
levers but Butch stuck so close 
they could not speak again. He 
thought it must be something 
about the reactor. Power was the 
life of Mother and the robots. If 
Joey could cut off the power — 



JAMBOREE

would they die? All of them? 

The idea frightened him. Who 
would care for the tenderfeet if 
the prams stopped? Who would 
make chow? Who would tell any- 
body what to do? Perhaps the 
books would help, he thought. 
Maybe Joey and his friend would 
know. 

With Pop rolling fast in the 
lead, they climbed a long hill and 
came in sight of Mother’s. Old 
gray walls that had no windows. 
Two tall stacks on dun brick. A 
shimmer of heat in the pale sky. 

The trail sloped down. Ratbait 
saw the crinkled ribbon of green 
brush along Black Creek and then 
the concrete bridge. He watched 
Butch watching Joey and listened 
to Blinkie panting and tried to 
think of how to help. 

The cubs stopped whimpering 
when they saw Mother’s mys- 
terious walls and stacks. The troop 
marched fast down the hill. Rat- 
bait slogged along, staring at the 
yellow sun-dazzle on old Pop’s 
hood. He could think of nothing 
to do. 

“1 got it,” Blinkie was breath- 
ing, close to his ear. “I’ll take care 
of Pop.” 

“You?” Ratbait scowled. “You 
were telling on Joey — ” 

“That’s why,” Blinkie gasped. 
“1 wanta make it up. I’ll handle 
Pop. You stop Butch an’ give the 
sign to Joey.” 

They came to the bridge and 
Pop started across. 



“Wait, Pop.” Blinkie darted 
out of line, toward the brushy 
slope above the trail. “I saw a 
girl. Hiding in the bushes to watch 
us go by.” 

Pop roared back off the bridge. 

“A girl in boy territory!” Its 
shocked voice splashed them like 
cold rain. “What would Mother 
say?” 

Black tracks spurting gravel, it 
lurched past Blinkie and crashed 
into the brush. 

“Listen, Pop!” Butch started 
after it, waving and squealing. 
“They ain’t no girl — ” 

Ratbait tripped him and turned 
to give Joey the sign but Joey was 
already gone. Something splashed 
under the bridge and Ratbait saw 
a yellow head vanishing under the 
stream that drifted out of a black 
tunnel. 

“Pop- Pop — ” Butch rubbed 
gravel out of his mouth and 
danced on the pavement. “Come 
back. Pop. Joey’s in the creek. 
Ratbait and Blinkie — they helped 
him get away.” 

The scoutmaster swung back 
down the slope, empty whips wav- 
ing. It skidded across the trail and 
down the bank to the hot creek. 
Its yellow hood disappeared in the 
steam. 

Blinkie clenched his fat fists. 

“You told on Joey, Butch.” 

“An’ you’ll catch it.” Murky 
eyes bugging. Butch edged away. 
“You just wait till Pop gets back.” 

They waited. The tired cubs sat 



10 



GALAXY 



down to rest and the tenderfeet 
fretted in their hot prams. Breath- 
ing hard, Blinkie kept close to 
Butch. Ratbait watched till Pop 
swam back out of the drain. 

The whips were wrapped around 
two small bundles that dripped 
pink water. Unwinding, the whips 
dropped Joey and his friend on 
the trail. They crumpled down 
like rag dolls but the whips set 
them up again. 

“How’s this, scouts?” Old Pop 
laughed like steel gears clashing. 
“We’ve caught ourselves a real 
live girl.” 

In a bird-quick way she shook 
the water out of her sand-colored 
hair. Standing straight, without 
the whips to hold her, she faced 
Pop’s glaring lamps. She looked 
tall for twelve. 

Joey was sick when the whips 
let him go. He leaned off the 
bridge to heave ,and limped back 
to the girl. She Wiped his face with 
her wet hair. They caught hands 
and smiled at each other as if they 
were all alone. 

“They tripped me. Pop.” Brav- 
er now. Butch thumbed his nose 
at Blinkie and ran toward the ma- 
chine. “They tried to stop my tell- 
ing you — ” 

“Leave them to Mother.” Pop 
bugled a song of joy. “Let them 
try their silly tricks on her.” It 
wheeled toward the bridge. The 
whips pushed Joey and the girl 
ahead of the crunching tracks. 
“Now hop with Pop to Jambo-

and can testify to the authenticity of 
her experiences. We've never been

ree! Hop with Pop! Hop, hop!” 

^HEY climbed that last hill to a 
tall iron door in Mother’s old 
gray wall. The floors beyond were 
naked steel, alive with machinery 
underneath. They filed into a dim, 
round room that echoed to the 
grating squeal of Pop’s hard tracks. 

“Fox Troop, here we are for 
Jamboree!” Pop’s jolly voice made 
a hollow booming on the curved 
steel wall, which reflected Pop’s 
red light. “Mother wants you to 
know why we celebrate this happy 
time each year.” 

The machine was rolling as it 
spoke to the center of a wide 
black circle in the middle of the 
floor. Something drummed far 
below like a monster heart and 
Ratbait saw that the circle was 
the top of a black steel piston. It 
slid slowly up, lifting Pop. The 
drumming died and Pop’s eyes 
blazed down on the cubs in the 
Anthrax Patrol, to stop their awed 
murmuring. 

“Once there wasn’t any Moth- 
er.” The shock of that crashed 
and throbbed and faded. “There 
wasn’t any yearly Jamboree. 
There wasn’t even any Pop, to 
love and care for little boys.” 

The cubs were afraid to whis- 
per but a stir of troubled wonder 
spread among them. 

“You won’t believe how ten- 
derfeet were made.” There was 
a breathless hush. “In those bad 
I old days, boys and girls were al-

lowed to change like queer in- 
sects. They changed into creatures 
called adults — ” 

The whips writhed and the red 
lamps glared and the black cleats 
creaked on the steel platform. 

“Adults!” Pop spewed the 
word. “They malfunctioned and 
wore out and ran down. Their 
defective logic circuits pro- 
gramed them to damage one an- 
other. In a kind of strange group 
malfunction called war they sys- 
tematically destroyed one another. 
But their worst malfunction was 
in making new tenderfeet.” 

Pop turned slowly on the high 
platform, sweeping the silent 
troop with blood-red beams that 
stopped on Joey and his girl. All 
the scouts but Ratbait and Blinkie 
had edged away from them. Her 
face white and desperate, she 
was whispering in Joey’s ear. 
Listening with his arm around 
her, he scowled up at Pop. 

“Once adults made tenderfeet, 
strange as that may seem to you. 
They used a weird natural pro- 
cess we won’t go into. It finally 
broke down because they had 
damaged their genes in war. The 
last adults couldn’t make new boys 
and girls at all.” 

The red beams darted to freeze 
a startled cub. 

“Fox Troop, that’s why we have 
Mother. Her job is to collect un- 
damaged genes and build them in- 
to whole cells with which she can 
assemble whole boys and girls. She 

JAMBOREE 



has been doing that a long time 
now and she does it better than 
those adults ever did. And 
that’s why we have Jamboree! To 
fill the world with well-made boys 
and girls like you and to keep you 
happy in the best time of life — 
even those old adults always said 
childhood was the happy time. 
Scouts, clap for Jamboree!” 

The cubs clapped, the echo 
like a spatter of hail on the high 
iron ceiling. 

“Now, scouts, those bad old 
days are gone forever,” Pop 
burbled merrily. “Mother has a 
cozy place for each one of you 
and old Pop watches over you, 
and you’ll never be adult — ” 

“Pop! Pop!” Butch squealed. 
“Lookit Joey an’ his girl — ” 

P op spun around on the high 
platform. Its blinding beams 
picked up Joey and the girl sprint- 
ing toward a bright sky-slice where 
the door had opened for the last 
of the prams. 

“Wake up, guys!” Joey’s scream 
shivered against the red steel wall. 
“That’s all wrong. Mother’s just 
a runaway machine. Pop’s a crazy 
robot--” 

“Stop for Pop!” The scoutmas- 
ter was trapped on top of that 
huge piston but its blazing lamps 
raced after Joey and the girl. 
“Catch ’em, cubs! Hold ’em tight. 
Or there’ll be no Jamboree!” 

“I told you, Pop!” Butch scut- 
tled after Joey. “Don’t forget I’m 



13 



the one that told. I’m the one — ” 
Ratbait dived at his heels. They 
skidded together on the floor. 

“Come on, scouts!” Joey was 
shouting. “Run away with us. Our 
own genes are good enough.” 

The floor shuddered under him 
and that bright sky-slice grew 
thinner. Lurching on their little 
tracks, the prams formed a line to 
guard it. Joey jumped the shriek- 
ing tenderfeet but the girl stum- 
bled. He stopped to pick her up. 

“Help us, scouts,” he gasped. 
“We gotta get away — ” 

“Catch ’em for Pop!” that met- 
al bellow belted them. “Or 
there’ll be no gold stars for any- 
body!” 

Screeching cubs swarmed 
around them. The door clanged 
shut. Pop plunged off the sinking 
piston almost too soon. The yellow 
hood crunched. Hot oil splashed 
and smoked but the whips hauled 
Pop upright again. 

“Don’t mess around with M-M- 
M-M-Mother!” The anvil voice 
came back with a stuttering croak. 
“She knows best!” 

The quivering whips dragged 
Joey and the girl away from the 
clutching cubs and pushed them 
into a shallow pit where that 
great black piston had dropped 
below the level of the floor. 

“Now sing for your Mother!” 
old Pop chortled. “Sing for the 
Jamboree!” 

The cubs howled out their of- 
ficial song and the Jamboree 



went on. There were Pop-shaped 
balloons for the tenderfeet, and 
double scoops of pink ice milk 
for the cubs and gold stars for 
nearly everybody. 

“But Mother wants a few of 
you,” old Pop purred. 

A pointing whip picked out 
Blinkie. He jumped into the pit 
without waiting to be dragged. 
But Butch turned white and tried 
to run when it struck at him. 

“Pop! Not m-m-m-m-me!” he 
squeaked. “Don’t forget I told on 
Joey. I’m only going on eleven 
and I’m in line for leader and I’ll 
tell on everybody — ” 

“That’s why Mother wants 
you.” Old Pop laughed like a 
pneumatic hammer. “You’re get- 
ting too adult.” 

The whip snaked Butch into the 
pit, dull eyes bulging more than 
ever. He slumped down on the 
slick black piston and struggled 
like a squashed bug and then lay 
moaning in a puddle of terror. 

Ratbait stood sweating as the 
whip came back to him. His stom- 
ach felt cold and strange and the 
tall red wall spun like a crazy 
wheel around him. He couldn’t 
■move. The whip pulled him to 
the rim of the pit. 

There Blinkie took his hand. 
Ratbait shook off the whip and 
stepped down into the pit. Joey 
nodded and the girl gave him a 
white, tiny smile. They all closed 
around her, arms linked tight, as 
the piston dropped.

“Now hop along for Pop! 
You’ve had your Jamboree — ” 

That hooting voice died away 
far above and the pit’s round 
mouth shrahk into a blood-colored 



moon. The hot dark drummed 
like thunder all around them and 
the slick floor tilted. It spilled 
them all into Mother’s red steel 
jaws. ¥ 



**GALAXY'S STARS** 



"My writing career started in Viet Nam, 
when a general asked me to prepare a report 
on the causes of malaria. " says T.J. Bass, a 
young pathologist from southern California, 
whose Half Past Human is this month’s 
featured novel. The report had to be written 
in non-technical language for laymen, and 
when I finished the whole thing sounded so 
much like science fiction, I decided to try my 
hand at that. After all. I'd been reading sf for 
years." 

Bass' first story. Star Itch, appeared in the 
September, 1968, issue of our companion 
magazine as an IF First, and he has been 
writing ever since. He extrapolates much of 
his material from his readings in current medi- 
cal journals. When the Giant Toothpick in 
Half Past Human treats cancer patients with 
heat, he adopts a current, though extremely 
high-risk, procedure. Even his ratio of one- 
third cured to two-thirds dead reflects the suc- 
cess-failure ratio today 

"The Giant Toothpick." says Bass, "began 
as a comic book for my kids. It is based on a 
39-inch hardwood tomato stake that I carry 
when 1 run cross country (Bass, a marathon 
runner, has his A.A.U. card) as protection 
against dogs. I painted eyes on my toothpick 
and the kids treat it like one of their dolls." 



Bass does much of the research for his 
stories on the hoof, using his co-runners as 
sounding boards and information banks His 
"hardware consultant" is the man who literal- 
ly put the legs on the moon module of Apollo 
11; his "electronic consultant " has designed 
a thermometer scheduled to be inserted in the 
moon to find out just how hot/ cold our satel- 
lite is: and his "software consultant" conducts 
a computer school for digital computer opera- 
tors. 

Bass and wife Gloria are raising five 
youngsters: Sara, Tom, Joan, Mary Pat and 
Karl (9, 7, 5. 3 and 1). The youngest is named 
for the Komputerized Aerospace Research 
Laboratory — an acronym from a soon-to-be- 
published story. Also in the Bass menage is 
goat Gertrude, a third-generation star milker. 
Her herd name is Stratford-belle, all the goats 
in the herd being named for Shakespearian 
characters. 

Does Bass envision a hive culture on plan- 
et Earth? "I like to think we have more than a 
few decades prehive time — hopefully there 
may be 50,000 years of five-toed time. But 
the hive seems to be evolving all around us. 
I just hope that mankind has a good foothold 
on several star systems before the hive cul- 
ture stagnates this planet.”

A Novel Complete In This Issue 



T. J. BASS 



The Nebishes had taken over Earth 
and Man faced a life so perfect 
that he had nothing to die for! 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



I 

I N THE Year of Olga, twenty- three 
forty-nine, Dan and Moon re- 
turned to Rocky Top Mountain. 
Edentulous and withered with years, 
they sought the shelter above the 
ten-thousand-foot level where the 
Big ES couldn’t reach. In this, the 
third millennium. Earth was avocado 
and peaceful. Avocado, because all 
land photosynthesized; and peaceful, 
because mankind was evolving into 
the four-toed Nebish — the compla- 
cent hive citizen. 

Dan and Moon had no time for 
complacency. Hunted and starving, 
they struggled for survival in an ecol- 
ogy where the food chain had been 



17 



shortened to its extreme. Earth So- 
ciety had squeezed its citizens be- 
tween the plankton ponds and the 
sewers, until there were no niches 
for the in-between people except 
with the varmints and vermin — 
thieving from garbage and gardens. 

The hive culture flourished under- 
ground. Three trillion Nebishes 
shared in Earth’s bounty and found 
happiness in the simple, stereotyped 
rewards rationed out by Earth So- 
ciety— the Big ES. Nothing moved on 
the surface except the Agrimechs and 
a rare fugitive such as Moon. He was 
a five-toed throwback unable to ad- 
just to the crowded society. Both he 
and his dog, Dan, were living fossils. 
Their species were crowded out by 
the Nebish masses, but they lived on. 
Both had been subjects in ancient ex- 
periments on the metabolic clock — 
rendering them clockless; so their 
bodies lingered through the genera- 
tions enabling them to witness, in 
agony, the extinction of their kind. 
The extinction was still going on, for 
an occasional throwback still appeared 
in the Nebish stock — primitives left 
behind by evolution. 

Faithful, dull-witted Agrimechs 
labored in the avocado-colored vege- 
tation, striving to catch every quan- 
tum of the sun’s energy and trans- 
form it into the needed carbohy- 
drates. Their mechanical intelligences 
were suited to their tasks — they were 
dedicated, reliable. On this day in 
2349 A.O. a new mech brain stirred 
on Rocky Top Mountain. Its circuitry 
was far more complex — it was quick- 
witted and faithful to no one and 
nothing but itself. 

“Hi ho! Old man with dog. Pick 
me up.” 



“Who speaks?” asked Moon, pick- 
ing up a rock. 

Dan’s snout wrinkled in a toothless 
snarl. 

“I am down here, under these 
leaves.” 

“The spirit of the spear?” 

“No— I’m a machine. Toothpick is 
my name.” 

Moon and Dan crouched a re- 
spectable distance away. 

“You are no machine I know. Ma- 
chines can move.” 

“I am a small one — to be carried. 
Pick me up.” 

Moon hesitated. 

“But the metal detectors — ” 

“Don’t worry. I’m not iron,” 
coaxed Toothpick. “Pick me up. I 
can feed you.” 

Moon and Dan were always a little 
hungry. 

“Edibles are welcome. Feed us 
and we’ll talk some more.” 

Toothpick instructed him to return 
to the valley. 

S enses alert, they crouched on 
the edge of the orchard. Harvest- 
ers rolled by on wide soft wheels 
like giant beetles, appendages folded 
and thorax-like bins laden with plank- 
ton powder, fruits and vegetables. 
The evening sun hid intermittently 
behind dark clouds on the western 
horizon. Moon waited for an agro- 
mech carrying wooden tomatoes. 
Shouting, he \\aved at the bulge of 
sensors— the “head” that housed 
communicator and neurocircuitry at 
its anterior end. The huge machine 
stopped. Moon gave its wheel a 
friendly pat. 

“Good afternoon, human.” 

“Need any repairs?”

GALAXY 



“Just a loose dust cover on my L 
box — but it can keep until we can 
get—” 

“I’ll take a look at it,” Moon said, 
going to the tool kit. While he 
worked on the load leveler he asked 
casually, “Anyone asking for me 
these days?” 

“No,” answered the bulky Har- 
vester. 

“Are you going to report seeing 
me?” 

“I haven’t been ordered to. I only 
report what I am ordered to report.” 

“I know.” 

Moon patted the machine affec- 
tionately. He knew it must report 
him if he stole part of the harvest. It 
would never hurt him or try to inter- 
fere but it had to report any damage 
or loss. 

“Mind if I ride along?” he asked. 

“I’d enjoy your company,” said 
the machine as it started to move 
slowly. 

Dan perked up his ears and began 
to pad along behind. Soon, as Tooth- 
pick had predicted, fierce thunder 
sounded and lightning flashed. Moon 
packed his sack with wooden tomatoes 
and strapped it on his back. The ma- 
chine stopped to let him off. It would 
report him as soon as the storm lifted 
— but by then it would be morning 
if Toothpick proved right. 

T he banana sun was well up in 
the grape sky when Moon re- 
turned to the sfwt where Toothpick 
protruded from the dusty humus. 
Below, on the flat land, the thunder- 
storm was beginning to dissipate. 

“You are a god,” said Moon as he 
sorted through glistening ten-inch 
spheres. 



“Hardly.” 

Moon talked while he cracked 
open one of the tomato-colored fruits 
and began to gum the moist pulp. 

“You brought the rains and you 
kept Harvester from reporting me.” 

The cyber spoke carefully, didacti- 
cally: “1 predicted the rain and the 
electrical activity kept the Harvester 
from reporting. My abilities are based 
on science, not sorcery.” For a mo- 
ment the cyber focused its optic pick- 
up on the old man and the dog as 
they struggled with the nutritious 
pulp in toothless mouths. It contin- 
ued; “Of course you could represent 
my powers as spiritual to any of your 
fellows. You could organize a follow- 
ing — establish a religion — ” 

Face screwed up in disgust, the old 
man answered, “Never. Cooperation 
is what the Big ES is made of — or- 
ganize, cooperate and crush the in- 
dividual. Man was meant to be wild 
and free.” 

Toothpick flexed his surface mem- 
brane charge and squirmed in the 
chocolate vegetable debris. 

“Pick me up.” 

Moon and Dan were still a bit 
chary about letting a talking javelin 
into their tight partnership. 

“Why?” 

“I am a companion robot — de- 
signed to offer companionship in ex- 
change for companionship.” 

“Dan and 1 are sufficient. What do 
we need with you? You can’t even 
walk. You’d be a burden.” 

“Both of you need teeth. Pick me 
up and I’ll help you find teeth,” said 
the cyber. 

Moon flicked his tongue over the 
stumps of tender dentine that were 
almost covered by hypertrophic gum

tissue. Two hundred years of chew- 
ing had worn them away. The subse- 
quent softening of his diet had soft- 
ened his body, too. To bite and chew 
again — he could not finish the 
thought. He picked up the hundred- 
centimeter javelin and the three of 
them left Rocky Top. 

B all, a metalloid sphere, occu- 
pied a rocky cairn in the center 
of a tattered neolithic village. A place 
of reverence, the cairn was sur- 
rounded by meager food offerings. 
The Ball protected them —the vil- 
lagers of Table Mountain— until 
their numbers had grown into the 
hundreds. Dawn brought them out of 
their sewn-hide shelters with flint 
tools, clay bowls and ripe grain- 
work, work. 

All activity stopped when the flap 
of the large shelter moved. Eyes fo- 
cused on the flap. A bald male 
stepped out. Hunched with age, he 
was dressed in flowing skins which 
had been stained with metachroma- 
tic berry juices. Walking quickly to 
the cairn, he placed both hands on 
the sphere, which resembled his own 
head in size and baldness. For a pen- 
sive moment the villagers studied 
their seer’s brooding face as he at- 
tempted to contact their unseen pro- 
tective deities. 

Alarm appeared on the aged face. 
Immediately the village broke up in- 
to families and small social units. 
Shelters came down and burins, 
scrapers and truncated flakes were 
wrapped with grain and dried meats. 
The bundles, folded in hides, were 
strapped on adult backs and weapons 
appeared in calloused hands. Mo- 
ments later the village was deserted 



— only dust and debris now remained. 

Across that dust walked a pubes- 
cent female leaving clear, measured 
five-toed footprints. She walked alone 
down a narrow trail. She was bait. 
Six sullen males, each carrying a 
heavy spear, watched her leave. 
Then they crouched into the dark 
crevices along the girl's trail. 

Silence returned to Table Moun- 
tain. The sun climbed higher. A male 
child — puberty minus five— became 
lost during the flight and wandered 
into the open. He never even heard 
the hum of the approaching arrow. 

The nattily clad, fat, pale bowman 
approached the flopping jungle bun- 
ny. With a heavy foot he steadied the 
small ribcage while he ripped out the 
barbed tip of the hunting arrow. He 
unsheathed the short curved blade of 
his trophy knife and bent over the 
twitching form. Mercifully falling 
blood pressure clouded the victim’s 
consciousness. The grisly trophy 
bagged, the Hunter renocked his ar- 
row and moved up the trail. Finding 
the village deserted, he followed the 
five-toed footprints down another 
slope. 

This was his third day without 
sleep — the small console on his neck 
titrated his hlood level of Speed. His 
buckeye detector saw nothing through 
the towering boulders. He paused 
cautiously. The six spear chuckers 
shifted impatiently in their hiding 
places. A flash of movement at the 
bottom of the trail — the bait showed 
herself. Another trophy. The Hunter 
started down the trail at a reckless 
trot. 

The spears flew. The throwers 
rushed out. 

The circuits of the buckeye detec- 



20

tor lay crushed on the trail. Chunks 
of fresh meat were divided among the 
fugitive villagers in their makeshift 
camps on the lower slopes. Their seer 
received his usual generous portion. 
His crystal ball had saved them again. 
The buckeyes of Mount Tabulum ate 
well that night. 

II 

T he Tinker of Mount Tabulum 
was skeptical. 

“You are a machine. You shouldn’t 
even be in the village. You might re- 
port us.” 

Moon held Toothpick up so the full 
volume of its lingual readout could 
play over the Tinker. Here was the 
man Toothpick said could reconstruct 
Moon’s teeth and Moon was going to 
see that he did. 

“I am a companion robot, thou- 
sands of years old,” said the cyber. 
“The old chains of command were 
broken while 1 slept. My superiors 
are gone. My only loyalty is to Moon, 
who found me. Moon needs teeth.” 
“How can I trust — ” began Tinker. 
“Ask your seer, the Hip,” sug- 
gested Moon. 

Tinker wordlessly led his visitors to 
the Hip. 

After a cursory glance at the new- 
comers the metachromatic-robed el- 
der gazed into his crystal and nodded 
approval. The Tinker shrugged and 
took Moon and Dan to his hut. Crude 
tools of flint, shell and bone were ar- 
ranged on a split log. Picking up a 
polished white stick. Tinker motioned 
for Moon to open his mouth. After 
prodding the gum line methodically 
for a few minutes he glanced into 
Dan’s mouth. Then he looked at his 



pitiful tools and slumped into a squat. 

“Those teeth are really worn out. 
Need full or three-quarter crowns on 
every one. Tin caps I can do — crowns, 
no.” 

Toothpick hummed a sharp re- 
quest: “What would you need to do 
the restorations here? Now? You’ve 
done similar work in Society. Let’s 
try it on the Outside.” 

“Tell him what you need. Tinker,” 
said Moon with a toothless grin. ^I’ve 
seen him make it rain. He can prob- 
ably get most anything for you.” 

Tinker remained skeptical but the 
prospect of working with his hands 
again excited him. He had nothing to 
lose but time — and there seemed to 
be a surplus of that. 

“Open up,” he said, reaching for 
his retouched levallois point. He 
pressed the cold flint against the firm 
tissue of the gum line and picked out 
a yellow flake of dental calculus. He 
put the flake on the tip of his index 
finger. “This calcified debris is all 
around those stumps. My stone tools 
arc probably strong enough to get it 
all out but it will be an awful lot of 
work. There’ll be pain and blood — 
and a danger of infection. The black 
area, however — ” he held Toothpick 
up so his optic pickup was in Moon’s 
mouth — “is decay. Decayed dentine 
is softer than enamel, of course. But 
it’s too tough for my primitive setup.” 
He thought a moment. “1 could adapt 
one of the power drills from an Agri- 
mech’s tool kit. It may bring a Hunt- 
er if we take one, though.” 

“I’ll handle that,” said Toothpick. 
“Go on.” 

Tinker began to show some interest 
in the project. He looked into Moon’s 
mouth again. 



HALF PAST HUMAN

“Most of these root canals are 
dead, I’d guess. It would be a good 
idea to fill them all. Cure the dead 
ones and drain any root abscesses 
that might be forming. I’ll need a 
rough metal wire to scrape out the 
canals and a medicated wick to cure 
them. Any antiseptic from a Hunter's 
kit will do to medicate even dilute 
phenol or iodine solutions -and any 
woven thread will do for the wick. 
That should be minor, after we get a 
power drill set up." 

Moon volunteered; “It’s my teeth 
and 1 know most of the Agrimechs in 
the east valley. Til leave for the tool 
kit now. Anything else you might 
need?’’ 

“Don’t load yourself down. Hunt- 
ers may be on your trail in half a day. 
Any small metal pliers, pick-types or 
small hard drill bits— it's your mouth. 
The smaller and the sharper the tools, 
the less trauma. We can bury them 
under a rock till we need them fool 
the metal detectors." said Tinker. He 
turned back to Toothpick. “I can use 
wax for the positive sand clay for 
the negative form. 1 need metal for 
simple casting. The metal?’’ He 
looked around. “I only have a little 
tin.’’ 

“Wouldn’t gold be best?” asked 
Toothpick. 

“Certainly." 

“Ball was wearing a cap when he 
was discovered.” said Toothpick. “It 
had enough gold foil. We can fire up 
a simple charcoal forge one day when 
all the molds are ready — shouldn’t at- 
tract any more Hunters than one of 
our regular campfires.” 

Tinker looked at Toothpick with a 
little more respect now that he real- 
ized how thoroughly the little cyber 



called Toothpick thought things out. 

T he tartar-chipping and gum- 
trimming went smoothly enough. 
Both Moon and Dan dragged them- 
selves around with swollen faces and 
rusty saliva for a few weeks but that 
was to be expected. However, when 
time came to drill away the black den- 
tine some frayed will power began to 
show. 

The drill bit was of a large coarse 
class that raised a lot of heat and vi- 
bration. The smell of cooking blood 
filled the village when the Tinker was 
working. Dan’s dog mind considered 
it torture and even a hundred years 
of discipline proved inadequate to 
keep him on the Tinker’s work table, 
the split log. Moon’s nerves, too, were 
pretty shot. They were about to give 
up the whole project when Toothpick 
suggested using Molecular Reward to 
disassociate the pain. 

Tinker dug up one of the console 
pumps taken from the neck of a killed 
Hunter. The last dose was the M.R. 
they were after. By diluting it one to 
a hundred they made a mouthwash 
that actually turned off the sensory 
and motor nerve endings in the mouth 
for several hours. For some reason 
saliva flowed very heavily while the 
M.W. was active but the Tinker 
made a flexible dam to keep the work 
area dry. From then on the work went 
quickly and — in slightly less than six 
months — Moon and Dan were smil- 
ing at each other with bright new 
teeth. 

At first the bite surfaces felt irregu- 
lar and unfamiliar but the chewing 
stresses adjusted the periodontal col- 
lagenous bundles until they were 
meeting smoothly.

“We’ll have to keep an eye on you 
for about three months,” said Tinker. 
“Don’t have any X-rays- but I didn’t 
fill any of the root canals until the 
wicks smelled sweet. One could still 
turn sour, though. If either of you get 
a swelling it would be best if I drained 
it out the side of the alveolar ridge.” 
He pointed to the cheek just above 
and below the tooth line. “That way 
we can save the rootand crown.” 

Moon massaged his jaw thought- 
fully. 

“I’ll let you know how it goes.” he 
said. Then he turned to Toothpick. 
“Now where to?” 

H unter control was empty 

except for the class five built-in 
cyber — Scanner. His myopic sensors 
were scattered over the Outside — 
Orange Country -which covered 
about a fourth of the continent. His 
memory banks stored data covering 
crop and harvest status, mech and 
buckeye movement and the presence 
or absence of Hunters. 

Rook, an aging human monitor, 
wandered in carrying his morning cup 
of hot brew. He slumped slowly into 
his console seat. The warm drink dif- 
fused through his system, numbing 
arthritic pains and stimulating a mild 
enthusiasm for his work. He nodded 
toward the wall panel, which showed 
a map of Orange Country. 

The topography flexed into three- 
dimensional relief, colors from choco- 
late to avocado indicating crop stages 
of cultivation, growth and harvest. 
These remained static, while move- 
ments of colored lights indicated ac- 
tivities of men and machines. 

“Anything on the fisheye detec- 
tor?” asked Rook. 



“No longer located over the canal. 
One of the buckeye detectors failed 
during the previous shift and fisheye 
was moved to cover the gap,” ex- 
plained Scanner. 

Rook frowned. Fisheye was his own 
project. To build a fisheye took weeks. 
Circuits sophisticated enough to dis- 
tinguish between water mammals and 
humanoids were hard to find these 
days. He hated to see it being wasted 
on a hill somewhere, doing a job any 
warm-body detector could do. He 
called up Cass. 

T he communicator screen focused. 

A hazy image of a younger man 
said, “Just a minute.” The speaker 
picked up a box of wires he was work- 
ing on and unplugged it. The image 
cleared. “What is it. Rook?” 

“The fisheye.” 

“Oh, sorry about that. But one of 
the detectors in the thirty-seven-oh- 
three line lost range. I had to cover 
the crops while I worked on it. So far 
I haven’t found the trouble. Sensors 
O.K. If the failure is in the image 
converter again we’ll be months wait- 
ing for parts. Can’t have a hole in the 
line that long.” 

Rook appeared irritated. 

The young man continued apolo- 
getically: “I know how interested you 
are in fisheye — but even if there is an 
aquatic variety of the 1 people 
they’re no problem as long as they 
stay in the water. When they come 
out to take crops the buckeye detec- 
tors will pick them up. Remember 
that a simple fifty-Au-gram B.D. can 
keep an eye on twenty square miles of 
open fields— but one of your fisheye 
detectors can only watch a few hun- 



HALF PAST HUMAN

dred yards of a canal. And the F.D. 
is going to cost several hundred Au- 
grams. It’s just impractical to watch 
all the canals. Even if the aquatics do 
exist, they aren’t much of a threat. 
Except for the dugong, we could use 
the B.D. readings. They catch a few 
canal surfaces. The occasional warm 
body moving there probably is Just 
one of those herbivores anyway. You 
know how man fears deep water.” 

Rook slumped back into his chair 
— depressed. The dugong could not 
be eliminated, of course. The problem 
was more than man’s affection for 
the last warm-blooded species to 
share his home planet — the dugong 
also kept vegetation from clogging 
the vital canals whenever the canal 
Harvesters were late. It took a F.D. 
at close range to tell a swimming 
humanoid from one of those Sirenia. 

Rook was frowning. 

“Don’t take it too hard. Rook. If 
your grant comes through you can set 
up a bunch of F.D.s. Meanwhile, I 
guess we have to protect the crops — 
this week’s harvest and next week’s 
harvest.” 

After a moment’s silence the 
younger man signed off, probably to 
return to his work bench. 

Already tired. Rook turned to the 
dull task before him. His grant — for 
fisheye census or the proof of the 
existence of an aquatic I people — was 
classified under research. Long-range 
buckeye control depended on an un- 
derstanding of their habits — but with 
next week’s crops in danger, the big 
ES would postpone research. Perhaps 
indefinitely. He shrugged and woke up 
Wolfhound IX. The crew of Hunters 
was assigned. Coordinates were given. 
A Hunt. 



M oses EPPENDORFF steered 
his minisub carefully through 
the mile-wide interior of the anaerobic 
digester. Visibility had been improved 
by recirculating a stream of clear ef- 
fluent through the center and adjust- 
ing the flow rate from turbulent to 
laminar, but massive islands of sludge 
still remained — acres ofo fungus and 
bacteria flourishing on the sewage 
nutrients. In the sub’s lights these re- 
sembled multicolored clouds and trail- 
ing seaweed above and firmer gela- 
tinous towers below. 

He maneuvered close to a yellow, 
translucent mass about ten times the 
size of his sub and extended his sam- 
pler tube into the gelatinous material. 
He aspirated a fragment and moved 
on. So far it looked like a routine in- 
spection. 

“No sign of membrane activity,” he 
said automatically after fifteen min- 
utes of silence. 

“You still have about a quarter mile 
to go. The first disturbance you’ll come 
to is on the other side of the bubble 
curtain in the aerobic section,” said a 
voice over the communicator. 

Moses recognized D. J. Birk, his 
immediate superior in the Pipe caste 
— a demanding but fair boss. 

Moses moved on through the aquat- 
ic jungle of microorganisms. His 
membrane scope saw nothing. The 
little cells — a micron and less in size — 
were polarized, of course. But the ion 
charge in their tiny cell walls was just 
too small for the scope’s probing mag- 
netic field. 

Something had been picked up by 
the digester’s sensors. Whatever it 
was, it had a membrane integrity on 



24 



GALAXY 



the level of a coelenterate and a size 
larger than his minisub. The data gave 
it sort of a ghostlike quality — it ap- 
peared in different parts of the digest- 
er, changed shape and disappeared, 
only to reappear at a different location. 
Birk had considered the readings as 
sensor malfunctions until he saw the 
caloric output of the digester. It had 
fallen when the “ghosts” had ap- 
peared. Electronic shadows don’t eat 
and neither do the other kinds of 
ghosts — so Moses had been sent in. 

“I’m passing through the bubble 
curtain,” Moses said. 

Around him the floating islands of 
sludge became aerated and buoyed to 
the surface. 

“I’ve got you on the screen. See any- 
thing?” asked D.J. 

“Nothing. Visibility is pretty good, 
too — more than thirty yards.” 

“Most of the sludge has been acti- 
vated in that section and the skimmers 
are removing — Watch it! Looks like 
a ghost forming up around you.” 

“Can’t see anything. The turbidity 
is increasing a little. That’s all — hey! 
Something just turned my sub over. 
Viewport clouded up. Can’t see a 
thing.” 

“Turn off your jets. It is alive and 
delicate. Your jets are tearing it apart. 
Keep recording. It’s carrying you up 
out of the range of this pickup.” 

Moses calmed down and deactivated 
his motor. A quivering, amorphous 
mass covered the port and blocked his 
view of the inverted world outside. The 
pressure dropped. The sub slowly 
righted itself. 

“My instruments tell me I’m on the 
surface but I still can’t see.” 

D.J. switched to the surface sensors 
in the arched ceiling of the digester. 



Optical pickup was blocked by a tan- 
gle of glistening, white and rootlike 
structures. He tried another pickup 
about a hundred yards away — re- 
ported nothing. Just the usual gas 
pocket — an arched dome trailing fine 
hairlike mycelia and the fluid surface 
quiet and flecked with foam. 

“Sit tight and keep your sensors on. 
You’re safe enough. If we want to get 
you out all we have to do is turn on 
your jets and rip that membrane ghost 
apart. Let’s see what it is up to,” said 
D.J. 

Moses activated his sampler tube 
and biopsied the thing that held him. 
Several hours later he biopsied it 
again. That bite shook the sub. The 
tensile strength of the thing had in- 
creased' markedly. He was about to 
complain when the film over the port 
rolled up into a rope-like structure and 
moved slowly away from him. He 
pressed his face against the flat cold 
surface and peered out. 

D.J. watched the ghost fade from 
the screen, leaving the sub’s silhouette. 

“The ghost is gone,” he said, 

Moses continued to stare for a mo- 
ment. 

He said, “Not gone. Dead.” 

His scope had registered a large 
sheet of ion activity when the creature 
was alive. Now the creature had 
changed from a huge amoebalike mass 
to a firm mat of tall white stems, each 
topped by a glistening white melon. 

Moses amended: “Not dead — 

fruited. It has fruited!” 

The sub sat in a bubble that was 
perhaps an acre in size and filled with 
stalks and melons. Most of the melons 
were gray and black — a few were split 
open. 

He described what he saw to D.J., 

25 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



heard his superior suck in his breath. 

“The Amorphus. It’s a fungus -a 
slime mold. I’ve seen them before in 
digesters — but only a few inches in 
diameter. Those fruiting bodies are 
delicious. If this is a large mutant of 
one of the edible species we’re rich! 
Can you suit up and get one of those 
white ones into your cockpit?” 

Moses put on his helmet, checking 
the air supply. The gases in a digester 
were not breathable. He would have to 
wait to learn if the slime-mold melon 
smelled like a truffle. He left the sub 
and returned. 

Objective accomplished. 

“We’ll name it the Eppendorff-Birk 
Melon when we file our report. It may 
become a significant food item if we 
can get it started in the other digest- 
ers,” D.J. said. 

Moses shrugged out of his sticky 
suit and sat down beside the melon. It 
was ovoid in shape, about two feet 
long and one foot in diameter. He 
prodded its slick skin. 

“Moses’ Melon,” he said. 

D. J. was suspiciously silent for a 
moment. 

Then he said cheerfully, “Right. 
Has a certain ring to it. Moses’ Melon. 
I’ll write it up that way and I’ll add a 
recommendation for a bonus for you. 
How’d you like to go on a Hunt?” 

Moses shook his head. 

“Trophy- taking never appealed to 
me. I’d like to climb a mountain, 
though.” 

“A climb then. Fine. See you next 
week,” said D. J., dismissing him. 

E ven in the off hours the tubeways 
were crowded. Half a million an 
hour passed through Moses Eppen- 
dorff’s home station. He put on his 




26 



GALAXY 




HALF-PAST HUMAN 



27 



nose filters and elbowed his way into 
the tube. The acrid stench made his 
eyes water. Humanity pulsed and 
flowed. The acceleration nauseated 
him and ruined what little appetite he 
was developing. Changing tubes twice 
brought him to his shaft city. The hun- 
dred-yard-wide floor of the shaft was 
covered with his anonymous neighbors 
— some queuing up at the dispensers, 
others milling to and from the tube- 
ways, others standing idle. He started 
up the spiral walkway that wound up 
the sides of the shaft, stepping over a 
discoloring corpse that still lay where 
he had seen it the day before. Two 
hours later, bone tired, he reached his 
crawlway. Sleep came quickly. Tomor- 
row he served on the megajury. 

I N THE crowded station a frightened 
girl quickened her pace. She wore 
the blue-white smock of Attendant 
caste. Through its folds her smooth 
body curves marked her as puberty 
plus four. Her green eyes darted over 
the crowd behind and around her — 
hundreds of blank faces flowing about 
her. She probably recognized the mass 
of nose-picking strangers that always 
seemed to fill the tubeways with its 
random movements — but now one 
pair of feet did not move randomly. 
They followed her. 

Rough hands reached for her 
through the crowd. Strong fingers 
bruised her shoulder, turning her into 
the knife point. The maniacal face, 
eyes too close together, aquiline nose 
and thin dry mouth were frozen into 
her memory molecules as the cold 
blade toyed with the soft tissues of her 
belly. Her screams and struggle went, 
unnoticed by the anonymous crowd. 
A large blood vessel parted under the 



blade and her strength faded. She 
slumped to her knees as he began the 
second stage of his compulsive act. 
The crowd continued its random 
movements. A careless footstep on her 
limp left hand snapped two small fin- 
ger bones. Other footsteps tracked the 
widening circle of red. 

As the murderer-rapist completed 
stage two the viewscreen froze, and 
the megajury voted. The trial com- 
puter had assembled a complete pic- 
ture of the crime this time, and Moses 
did not hesitate to press his “execute” 
button. The arguments for suspension 
fell on deaf ears — too many of the 
organically ill were awaiting suspen- 
sion spaces as it was. It was no time to 
be overly generous toward the psy- 
chotics. The Murder-Rape-Syndrome 
and the mad dog Mass-Murder-Syn- 
drome had increased logarithmically 
with the population and Moses had 
little hope that these killers could 
ever be returned to society at the pre- 
sent population density. He felt he 
owed it to society to press the button. 

The screen switched to the cell of the 
accused. Same aquiline features. He 
was casually eating a light breakfast. 
His bioelectrical parameters ran across 
the bottom of the split screen. He did 
not even know when the megajury tally 
hit over fifty-percent. Heavy metal 
ions and toxic radicals tied up his 
enzyme systems and the bioelectricals 
began to flatten out — cerebral, myo- 
cardial, even duodenal. 

Moses switched to light musicals 
and began to eat his own breakfast of 
woven protein. Another day. 

H e adjusted his cubicle air 
vent and took a deep breath. 
“What does the Outside smell of to- 



28 



GALAXY 



day?” came a voice from the doorway. 
It was Simple Willie, his neighbor 
from the next cubicle, shaftward. 

“Green,” said Moses. 

Simple Willie sauntered in and col- 
lapsed into a corner. His right hand 
was cupped toward Moses. Moses 
nodded. Willie held up the same 
cupped hand so the dispenser’s optic 
pickup could register the unspoken 
order. A half liter of foamy dropped 
into the chute, charged to Moses. 

“Green is a color, not an odor,” 
mumbled Willie as he foamed up his 
nose and upper lip. 

“1 consider it both — like artichoke 
or avocado can be both a color and a 
flavor.” 

Willie drained his foamy dry and 
looked wistfully toward the opposite 
wall. 

“Artichokes and avocados were 
more than just colors and flavors once. 
They were real things — parts of plants, 
I think.” 

Moses watched Willie in silence. 
Willie had been on the Outside. The 
excursion had started out as a hunt but 
after Willie had bagged his trophy an 
accident had occurred during his drug 
delirium and he had become lost. He 
had wandered around Outside for over 
a year and had never been the same 
after he returned to society. 

He could not face the crowded tube- 
ways or hold down a job. Society gave 
him calorie basic — fifteen hundred 
unflavored — and quarters basic — 

thirty cubic yards. He was living out 
his years quietly in half the space al- 
lotted to Moses. Whenever Moses 
came home Willie visited him to enjoy 
the spaciousness and flavors to which 
Moses’ jobs entitled him. Willie was 
pleasant enough, Moses thought, but 



his habit of fondling his grisly, cubed 
trophy and mumbling incoherencies 
had earned him the nickname Simple. 

Willie continued; “There used to be 
many kinds of plants — yellow was the 
turnip purple was the beet dum de 
dum de dum dum good enough to eat. 
I forget how the rest of it goes. That 
was a rhyme my mother taught me. 
Did you have a mother?” 

“No, 1 don’t think so,” said Moses. 
He knew that the embryogenesis 
laboratories had produced most of the 
present four-toed generation of Ne- 
bishes — the superior Homo sapiens. 

“Too bad. I enjoy my memories of 
my mother. I’d like to have a family of 
my own — this living alone in - these 
tiny apartments just isn’t any good. I 
wish I had a son.” 

“Why?” 

“It is sad to die — unmourned.” 
Talking to Willie always made 
Moses feel uncomfortable. He walked 
back tPThe air vent and changed the 
subject. 

“I still say it smells green Outside. 
I think I’ll go have a look for myself.” 
Willie recoiled. “You’re not going 

“I’ll just climb up to the shaft cap 
and look through the grill. No harm in 
that. Why don’t you come along?” 
Willie withdrew into his corner and 
toyed with his trophy cube. 

“Can’t stand those crowds on the 
spiral walkway. Damn people. There 
are too many of them. I used to be able 
to fight my way through any crowd 
when 1 was younger. But that was be- 
fore I went Outside.” Willie took off 
his boots, exposed his three-toed feet. 
“Lost my toes out there, too.” 

Moses chided him: “Lost your toes 
and your guts. I guess that’s where 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



29 



they got the saying that mankind is 
leaving its fifth toe and its initiative 
behind as it evolves into the four-toed 
Nehish.” 

Willie’s face reflected both fear and 
anger as he sorted out his feelings. He 
stood up hesitantly. 

“Maybe I will come with you, if — if 
the walkway isn’t too crowded.’’ 

They filled their pockets with sweet 
bars, fat cubes and woven protein from 
Moses’ dispenser and started out. 

T hey crawled the fifty yards to 
the shaft and peered out onto the 
spiral walkway. Only a few middle- 
aged and apathetic adults straggled 
by. No crowd. They walked over to 
the railing and leaned out into the 
shaft. An eighth of a mile below the 
floor of the shaft was a hazy disc of 
heads. Above them the shaft cap was 
a vague glow — more than a half-mile 
straight up. They started around the 
upward spiral, passing anonymous 
crawlways of their neighbors in the 
shaft city. 

An hour later they took a drink 
break — each quarter mile turn of the 
walkway only lifted them twenty yards. 
It would take them over three hours to 
walk up to the cap. 

“Enjoy looking Outside?” asked Wil- 
lie. 

“Oh, I don’t know — been so long. I 
find it interesting, I suppose.” 

“Humans used to live Outside.” 
Willie’s wistful expression returned. 
“Used to live in the ocean too — that’s 
why we have gill slits as embryos. But 
the ocean, and the Outside were just 
stages in our development. Now we’ve 
evolved into the Big ES — hive culture, 
colony people.” 

Moses was not sure of what Simple 



Willie meant by the Big ES — society, 
state or establishment. Simple Willie 
had talked like that for so long that 
now Moses thought of the Big ES as 
some sort of living thing that con- 
trolled mankind — but the concept, 
of course, was not logical. 

“Used to need five toes, too — run- 
ning and climbing all over like that. 
But now Big ES takes care of us — 
don’t need five toes,” continued Willie. 

Moses looked at his own boot. 

“You didn’t always think Big ES 
was good?” 

Willie smiled knowingly. They had 
discussed Big ES frequently. It was 
Willie’s favorite topic. 

“No. That’s why I stayed on — when 
I found myself Outside after the drugs 
wore off. At first I couldn’t stand it. 
All that open space — I wasn’t used to 
it. And there was weather.” 

Moses waited for him to continue. 

“That’s changes in temperature, 
you know. It was light and dark. The 
air moved fast and then it stood still. 
The ground became covered with foam 
and then it dried. Weather!” Willie 
took another quick drink at the foun- 
tain and started eagerly up the walk- 
way. “Maybe we’ll see some weather if 
we hurry.” 

Moses followed him. 

Willie realized his mistake in having 
shown enthusiasm about anything to 
do with Outside. He glanced about for 
the optic pickups of Big ES and slowed 
his pace. 

“Weather is awful,” he said. “Man 
wasn’t meant to live in weather. Big 
ES explained that to me very thor- 
oughly. When I came back from my 
wild life on the Outside they explained 
how man was meant to live in cities — 
not between cities where the I people 



30 



GALAXY 



live. The 1 people were bad because 
they trampled the crops and repro- 
duced like animals. That was explained- 
to me real good.” 

They walked in silence for a time. 
The sunlight filtering through the 
shaft cap above began to fade into 
dusk. 

Willie continued: “Of course it is 
natural for the I people to act like 
animals — they are part animal. Some 
u.sed to think the 1 people were our 
five-toed ancestors but Tm certain we 
both descended from a common an- 
cestor. They’re just a blind end of 
evolution — unable to form large social 
groups of a billion or so -unable to 
survive.” He made a gesture of dis- 
gust. “Eating human flesh those five- 
toed creatures actually eat the flesh of 
their own kind — and any of the four- 
toed Hunters they catch. I can see how 
evolution may have equipped them 
with a reproductive drive that is a bit 
wild by the standards of Big ES but 
I can’t accept their flesh-eating habits. 
1 suppose that is why I’m proud of my 
trophy I hunted the last of Earth’s 
carnivores.” 

At the rim of the cap they got a 
glimpse of a blue sky through a metal 
grill. Willie clutched his chest and sat 
down facing the blank wall of the walk- 
way. 

“1 can’t look out,” he said simply. 

Moses gazed through the grill, des- 
cribing the scene out loud for Willie’s 
benefit- sunset, plum and grape 
colors darkening to a star-speckled 
licorice. He and Willie sat on a feature- 
less platform that ran around the 
yawning shaft. The grill- a stout one- 
inch gauge, six-inch mesh — ran up 
thirty yards to a roof which appeared 
to be rimmed with shaggy greens. In 



the gathering darkness a man-sized 
Agrimech scuttled in from the fields 
and disappeared into its garage in the 
base of the platform. Plankton ponds 
lit up and the fields became covered 
with the clouds of agrifoam which car- 
ried auxins and nutrients. Rows of dis- 
tant shaftcaps marched to the horizon 
— each about a mile apart and each 
housing a shaft city of fifty thou.sand. 

“Stars?” came Willie’s plaintive 
voice. 

Moses nodded. 

“Bright and white. Some big like an 
eye peeking down. Others small and 
numerous like spilled metallic dust.” 

As he watched them blink he found 
the old familiar pattern of Orion — un- 
changed since he had seen it before, 
several years ago. The shoulders, feet 
and belt. During his subterranean 
existence he had had little curiosity 
about astronomy. Sewage was real. 
The sky was just a background for 
scenes on entertainment shows. 

The night passed and an Irrigator 
trundled along a canal, drenching the 
land. Foam vanished. Orion marched 
westward until dawn erased him but 
Moses was confident “he” would re- 
turn again. Outside seemed to have 
some stability and pattern to its roof 
even at night. 

In the growing light Moses turned to 
see Simple Willie still sitting, his fore- 
head pressed against the wall. He was 
not asleep. 

“Willie — do you see things in the 
stars?” Willie cringed and covered his 
eyes and Moses reworded the question 
carefully. “When you were outside — 
the stars came out each night, didn’t 
they? Could you see outlines of things 
in them? Things that came back again 
and again?” 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



31 



Willie did not answer. He rose slow- 
ly to his feet and slouched down the 
ramp. Moses took one last look Out- 
side and followed. They walked in 
silence for several quarter-mile turns 
of the spiral. 

Finally Simple Willie spoke. 

“Don’t remember too good. Stars? 
I know I must have seen them — but 
can’t remember actually looking. Lots 
of things about my time on the Out- 
side are all mixed up. Do you think it 
could have been the drugs?” 

“Maybe -Speed does more than 
make you go fast.” Moses spoke sym- 
pathetically. “Maybe the Big ES 
erased some of your memories, too- 
trying to make you a more useful citi- 
zen.” 

Willie stopped and smiled his relief. 
“Of course. The Big ES put in blocks 
to keep my nostalgic memories from 
flooding out of my deep amygdaloid 
complex. But the blocks are not com- 
plete. Some memories get through.” 

Willie abruptly sat down, again 
pressed his forehead against the wall. 
Sullen, morose and brooding, he mum- 
bled something about the most beauti- 
ful creature he had ever seen. Moses 
tried to prod him out of his catatonic 
state but Willie’s gloom deepened into 
stupor. Simple Willie spent much of 
his time so- Moses was used to seeing 
him in this condition. All that was 
missing was the grisly .trophy cube 
Willie sometimes earned. After a half- 
hour Moses shrugged- left a few bars 
of woven protein, the flavored kind 
Willie liked, and went to his quarters. 
Willie would come out of it sooner or 
later. 

Moses often wondered about Willie's 
sudden depressions. Drugs during or 
after his spell on the Outside could be 



the explanation — or Willie actually 
could have cracked under the strain of 
Outside. 

Had Willie had some special exper- 
ience that had broken him? Guilt? 
Moses wondered if any connection 
existed between the trophy cube and 
Willie’s mumblings about the beauti- 
ful creature but Moses was not too 
good at anatomy. A trophy was a tro- 
phy. He wished he could at least tell 
the trophy’s sex. He suspected that 
Willie’s “beautiful creature” had been 
a female human. The idea fit Willie’s 
obsession with reproduction during his 
lucid periods. If his trophy were also 
female —well, perhaps Willie had 
killed the only thing he loved. Moses 
did not like to think that of his neigh- 
bor. 

IV 

F or several days Moses dialed for 
information about Outside. Star 
maps were available. They were coded 
under seasons but Moses was not sure 
what a season was. He did learn 
Orion’s star pattern was permanent. 
Under plants he found a few scant 
crops — trees, vines, fleshy things and 
grasses. Under animals he found his 
fellow superior humans, the four-toed 
Nebishes and the lower, five-toed I 
people. The I people were described 
as cannibals and thieves — the var- 
mints of the year 5000 A.D. The in- 
formation bank estimated the popula- 
tion of the I people at less than half a 
million in a world that held over three 
trillion Nebishes. Then it editorialized 
that they would become extinct as soon 
as society found the funds for a really 
big Hunt. 

Moses waited to see what other ani- 
mals would be mentioned and was 



32 



GALAXY 



surprised at the brief list — mostly life 
forms that had adapted to mankind’s 
subsistence civilization — vermin in 
his cities, a grazing aquatic mammal 
and a few shellfish in his irrigation 
canals. Nothing walked the land, 
swam the seas or flew in the air. Moses 
didn't miss them — never having 
known them. He was merely a little 
amazed that the total mass of animal 
flesh on the planet was one species — 
Man. 

At the end of the week he checked 
in with D.J. at Pipe caste communica- 
tions center. He sat on the edge of his 
bed, munching his breakfast, while the 
viewscreen focused. 

“No need' to come in this shift. Your 
Climb has been authorized. The Moses 
Melon looks like a success. It is a mu- 
tant slime mold. The troph stage is an 
amoeba that thrives in aerobic sludge. 
It coalesces in maturity to sporulate 
like a fungus. The boys from Synth 
plan to gray-age the melon and try it 
in the mushroom flavor line at first. 
We’ll be rolling in Au-grams if it goes 
over. When you come back from your 
Climb check in again. We’ll see how 
it’s moving.” 

The words were what Moses had 
expected —more or less — but D..l.’s 
face seemed tight and his voice had 
sounded strained. 

Moses Eppendorff’s dispenser be- 
gan to drop items for the Climb. He 
carefully checked his new suit of 
clothes for defects before he chucked 
the soiled ones down the chute to the 
digester. His kit contained food bars 
for the tube trip. He would be in the 
tubeways for several days — even with- 
out losing time at dispensers. Public 
dispensers had an irritating way of 
delaying a traveler — otherwise he 



tolerated them. After all, most dis- 
pensers were only class tens — and 
identities had to be carefully checked. 
Moses did not want a nonworker eat- 
ing flavored calories and charging 
them to his account. He was not made 
of Au-grams. 

Before he left he looked in on Simple 
Willie. Willie had made it home but he 
was still catatonic. His eyes were 
glazed. 

F or two days Moses fought his 
way through the stinking crowds. 
He was weak from trying to keep his 
footing in slippery excrement and 
crushed roaches, sore from tripping 
over neglected bodies and continually 
nauseated by the rotten vapors that 
saturated his nose filters. He was 
sorry he had come. 

He stepped out at a strange shaft 
city to rest, saw the usual piles of ref- 
use and hostile stares. He found him- 
self dozing against the wall when he 
heard the sickening thud of a jumper. 
Another suicide. From the fragmenta- 
tion of the skeleton Moses Judged that 
he or she had started a quarter of a 
mile up the shaft. What bothered 
Moses was that the jumper had not 
had the simple decency to scream a 
warning as he/she approached — to 
give crowd on the shaft floor a chance 
to give him/her room to land. As it 
was, the jumper took a couple with 
him/her. 

Moses was wide awake now. He el- 
bowed his way back into the tubeway 
and continued toward the mountain. 

A class nine mop brushed by. Its 
five-foot-tall snail shape took up the 
space of ten humans as it busied itself, 
wetting, scrubbing and sucking at the 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



33 



stained floor. Its thin-walled sac al- 
ready contained one large lump that 
had elbows and knees. 

The tubeway deposited Moses on 
the floor of the rec shaft. He found 
himself alone. A large dispenser called 
his name and issued him a heavy pack 
of rations. He stood, strapping it on 
his back, mentally complaining about 
his own Pipe caste. The Pipe people 
had designed a system that moved 
humans with their food, water and air 
all over the planet — thousands of 
miles — but only horizontally. Never 
up. The energy simply was not avail- 
able. 

Moses looked up the shaft. It was 
narrow — a mere thirty yards in diam- 
eter. The spiral walkway had a twenty 
per cent grade and only an occasional, 
abandoned crawlway. He could not see 
the top. A black pinpoint in the center 
of the dimly lit spiral marked what he 
guessed was the two-mile height. 

He took a deep breath of the cold, 
damp, metallic air and strode out. 
Three hours later he passed three 
gray-haired men leaning on their 
packs. 

He felt smug about his endurance 
until, an hour later, a girl — puberty 
plus seven — passed him. Her pack was 
about the size of his too. She wore the 
smock of the Attendant caste. 

He stopped at the one-mile level to 
sleep. When he checked one of the 
crawlways he was surprised at how 
sterile the cubicles were. Without food 
and water dispensers man never nested 
there — and without man his vermin 
did not either. 

Moses slept soundly for more than 
ten hours. 

His Attendant met him at the top of 
the ramp. She was a puberty-plus-ten 



female — pleasant enough but dull- 
witted and sterile. He stood, sweating 
and swaying a little under his heavy 
pack — exhausted. She steadied him 
with a firm hand on his damp shoulder 
strap. 

“Supper or sex?” was her greeting. 

Politeness prevented him from 
growling, “Sleep.” This was a Climb, 
after all. He forced a smile and care- 
fully straightened his aching back. 

“Let’s try both,” he said, “after I’ve 
refreshed myself.” 

“Saved us some water. Come on. 
We’re family for two weeks.” 

She led him toward his room. 

The stereotyped hetero relationship 
suited his psyche — but he was tired 
and the water was too cold and too 
scanty. She was openly bored — effi- 
cient but bored — and their cot was too 
hard for his tender muscles. The night 
became another nothing in his life. 

Dawn was a bright surprise. At full 
blaze the yellow sun quickly rose above 
a pair of snow-covered peaks, filling 
his room with a blinding glare. One 
entire wall was transparent. His At- 
tendant stumbled awkwardly from the 
cot and turned down the wall, chang- 
ing the sun into a pale moon. Then she 
collapsed back on the bedding. 

He walked to the edge of the room 
and looked down. Pyramids of mo- 
notonous cubicles covered the lower 
slopes as far as he could see — he was 
reminded of an obscene glacier. The 
black crags of the distant mountains 
still looked pure — they seemed to be 
naked rock — but the distance was too 
great for his visual resolution. He 
could not be sure that they too were 
not coated with windows. He hoped 
that at sundown they would remain 
black instead of flaming up with the 



34 



GALAXY 



reflected rays. That would be reas- 
suring. 

“Breakfast?” The Attendant was 
fingering through his heavy packs. 

Odd, but when she began to share 
his food— food he spent two days 
hauling up from shaft base — she 
changed in his eyes. No longer was she 
an Attendant, here for his companion- 
ship. Now she was a parasite, trading 
her little efforts for calories — and 
flavored calories at that. 

T hree walls of the bar opened to 
the Outside. But the walls were 
turned way down low, giving the place 
an eerie cavelike air. Moses could see 
hazy outlines of the sky and moun- 
tains Outside, although he knew the 
hour must be close to noon. In the 
darkness the four-toed Nebishes 
crowded, thigmotropically, around the 
massive stone bar, comforted by the 
warm elbows and hips of their fellows. 

They stood before the dispenser in 
their standard-issue-tissue clothes — 
loose transparent garments of party 
people. Moses dialed drinks and 
joined the clot of people. 

“Tell me again how you executed the 
murdering rapist,” his Attendant said. 

He grunted and concentrated on his 
drink. 

A hostile, short man with a round, 
white face glanced his way, spoke loud- 
ly from across the bar. 

“Not too manly — killing a prisoner 
by remote control and diluting the 
guilt in the group conscience of the 
megajury.” 

Moses had heard these arguments 
before. Now that they were directed to 
him personally they stirred up reflex 
hatreds. He was pleased to know he 
could still hate. The adrenal surge was 



surprisingly exhilarating. He and the 
short man eyed each other across a 
room filled with apathetics. 

“Would you have put the psychotic 
in suspension — crowding out a good 
citizen who needed a place to await a 
cure for an organic illness?” asked 
Moses. 

The hostile one sipped his drink and 
answered, “The crowding in suspen- 
sion is all theoretical. Your button- 
pushing megajury is actual. You can’t 
weigh a real life against theory. Ideas 
aren’t that solid.” 

Moses parried with the obvious. 
“What is real? And what is manly? 
Have you ever killed anyone?” 

“No, but I tried. Didn’t make a 
group activity out of it either. Went on 
a Hunt. Man to man. Didn’t see any- 
thing, though,” said the little man. 

“But you were armed and going 
against an ignorant savage. Used 
drugs, too. I’ll wager. That’s not too 
manly.” 

“I was there, putting it on the line. 
Not sitting here talking big about a 
megajury killing.” 

“You’re here now.” 

The little man’s adrenergic re- 
sponse pulled him from his stool. 

He strode around the bar shouting 
at Moses: “Look, killer — you’re prob- 
ably real good at pushing buttons. 
I went Outside but I didn’t see any- 
thing — ^just the black dirt, some damn 
Agrifoam and a few shaft caps. No 
trophies. There were no buckeyes 
where the detectors said there were. I 
say the buckeyes are extinct — that’s 
why I’m here and not on a Hunt. 
Waste of time — a Hunt.” 

Moses taunted him: “First you 
doubt the suspension crowding — now 
the buckeyes. Not too trusting, hey?” 



HALF PAST HUMAN

The little man calmed. 

“1 question lots of things — like 
what is on the other side of this moun- 
tain. More cubicles, they say. I say — 
nothing. This planet is empty, not 
crowded.” 

“The other side of this mountain 
should be no mystery. Let’s climb up 
and have a look at it,” challenged 
Moses. 

The bar grew silent. All eyes moved 
to the ceiling where coils of rope hung 
from rusted pitons. The pitons, gran- 
ular with age. were symbolic of the 
Climb. Most of the Nebishes came 
here to drink and watch. Today Mo- 
ses and the little hostile one would 
entertain them. 

Clumsy in his insulated gear, Mo- 
ses crunched across the virgin snow 
to the edge of the balcony. A flexible 
ladder danced in the wind. The hos- 
tile crunched past and put his foot in- 
to a rung to hold the ladder taut. He 
gestured for Moses to go first. 

Moses started up. 

The hostile released the ladder 
jumped out of the snow and the wind 
sailed Moses out over the mile deep 
crevasse. Spinning like a kite, he saw 
the view rotate sky, mountain and 
misty chasm. The vastness triggered 
primordial fears. His muscles locked 
rigidly. Around and around he turned 
until his gravity sense was lost- mists 
above and below merged. Time 
stopped. The snowflakes on his face 
plate refused to melt. 

When the wind changed direction 
he swung back over the ledge. Dizzy, 
he looked down at the firm surface 
mocking him only a few feet below. 
The ladder’s slack whipped up huge 
chunks of snow as it snaked back 



and forth. He tried to climb down but 
his fingers were still frozen to the 
rungs by fear. The group from the 
bar stood, drinks in hand, spectating 
through the open door and taking 
sadistic pleasure in his terror. The 
wind sent him spinning back over the 
void and he blacked out. 

H e felt himself falling. Scream- 
ing, he opened his eyes to see 
that he was safe on the cot in his 
room. Bulky dressings covered his 
hands and feet and his nose hurt. 
His Attendant hurried to his side with 
a liter of hot broth. She steadied his 
bandaged hands while he drank. 

“Drink this. Try to relax but don’t 
close your eyes until you get back all 
the sensation in your arms and legs. 
You’ll feel like you’re falling for a 
while. Your centers of balance are 
probably scrambled. You were spin- 
ning around out there for several 
hours before I got you down.” 

The broth was not too bad- woven 
protein, a vegetable bar and a couple 
of fat cubes. It strengthened him 
quickly. 

“Thanks,” he said. “Hope these 
bandages come off soon. Roundface’s 
little trick wasn’t so funny. I’m going 
to climb that ladder.” 

V 

T hree days later Moses made 
the Climb easily. The hostile went 
first and was waiting on the ledge. 
Roundface cracked his helmet to 
speak. 

“Sorry about the ride on the ladder 
the other day — but it was the best 
way I knew to cure your Outside 



36 



GALAXY 



phobias. How did you feel during the 
Climb today?” 

Moses shrugged. 

“Okay, killer. Follow me. We hike 
up the ridge to the snow line. Then 
it’s a mile or so to the cave. We’ll 
sleep there and go on to the summit 
in the morning.” 

Moses followed him silently. After 
a while the snow flurries forced him 
to close his helmet. The trail was nar- 
row and rough. Ice and loose drifts 
of snow made the footing treacherous. 
Fortunately there was a line and pi- 
tons in the steep spots. At dusk they 
switched on their suit lights and con- 
tinued toward the lip of the mini- 
glacier. Moses sipped water and 
turned up his oxygen. 

Glancing eastward at the other 
mountain range he saw the slopes be- 
gin to glow as the cliff-dwellers 
turned on their lights. Soon all the 
foothills were lit also — humans every- 
where. Depressing. 

Moses was getting tired of wading 
through the knee-deep powder when 
he saw the wail of dark stone. A tri- 
angular crack at the base formed the 
mouth of a cave. The hostile flicked 
his light inside and then began to 
walk random circles in the snow. 

“Moses,” he said politely. “You 
go inside and unroll your bedding 
while 1 try to find some firewood out 
here.” 

Numb with cold and fatigue, Mo- 
ses wandered deep into the cave. It 
was about five feet in diameter at the 
mouth but widened out to three times 
that twenty yards inside. Odd. Moses 
thought he smelled wood burning. 

“Okay in there?” Roundface 
shouted. 



“Sure.” 

A moment later Moses was knocked 
to his knees by a clap of thunder 
that shook the cave floor and show- 
ered him with pebbles and grit. In 
the silence that followed he heard an 
evil laugh from far back in the cave. 
He held his breath, heard approach- 
ing footsteps. 

Moses crawled into a corner and 
adjusted his suit light to tight beam. 
He fumbled for his small ice pick. 
The clap of thunder had come from 
the mouth of the cave. Since then 
there had been no sound from the 
hostile. 

A flame danced weakly in the back 
of the cave. Moses killed his own 
light and huddled farther into his 
corner. What he saw chilled him. 

A sinewy old man carried a burning 
pine cone on a stout spear. His legs 
were wrapped and he wore tattered 
rags and a loose outer cloak. 

He was not alone. Walking before 
him was a squarish, four-legged beast 
that was supposed to be extinct — a 
seventy-pound, nonhuman carnivore. 
Moses did not know what the beast 
was but the long, well-toothed snout 
told its diet. 

Man and beast moved past Moses 
toward the mouth of the cave. Sev- 
eral minutes later they returned. Now 
the old man carried something that 
looked like a human leg. It was being 
carried casually by its knee and it 
dripped. This time the procession 
stopped at Moses’ hiding place. 

“Moses Eppendorff?” asked the 
old man. He added without waiting 
for an answer: “Come on back by the 
fire. We want to talk.” 

From his seated position on the 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



37 



floor of the cave Moses viewed the 
beast as hopeless odds. Trying to 
carry his ice pick casually, he got to 
his feet and led the way to the fire. 

The flame was small, stingy, fed by 
a few fragments of pine knot. The 
floor was littered with bones and 
small bundles of twigs. The bones 
varied from arched rib cages to whole 
skulls lined up neatly along the wall. 

A buckeye camp. 

“Pull up a rock and relax. I’ll have 
something cooking for us in a min- 
ute.” 

The old man stabbed a stout peg 
through the leg and hung it in one of 
the dark recesses of the cave. 

“You’re not planning on eating 
that—” 

Moses gagged. 

“This red thing? Oh, no. That fresh 
stuff is too tough. I’ve got a nice aged 
quarter here.” 

The old man went to another recess 
and brought back a shrunken black 
object. It had a little mold on it and 
did not look human to Moses. He 
asked no question. 

T he glowing coals flared up white 
and blue under the dripping 
meat. The beast lay, chin on paws, in 
the outer ring of warmth, waiting pa- 
tiently for the scraps. Moses waved 
away his share. The old man tossed 
it to the animal. Man and beast 
bared gleaming yellow teeth and de- 
voured their respective portions. Wip- 
ing his mouth on his forearm, the old 
man turned to Moses. 

“The conditions in this cave are 
Just right for aging meat. Makes the 
trip worthwhile.” 

Moses frowned. 

“Meat? Wasn’t that a human be- 



ing you just killed? Don’t you have 
any feelings?” 

“Just so much protein to me. Can’t 
have much feeling about one of the 
four-toeds anyway — parasites!” The 
old man pointed his short spear at 
Moses and admonished: “and I 

wouldn’t waste any time mourning 
that one, Moses. He had the same 
thing planned for you. Didn’t you 
notice the way he sent you into this 
cave first? He’s been at this Rec Cen- 
ter long enough to hear the gossip. 
I’ve been here before — and they never 
know when I’ll be back.” 

“You’re a — buckeye?” asked 
Moses. 

The old man stood up apologeti- 
cally. 

“Oh, I am sorry. We’ve been wait- 
ing for you to climb up here so long 
— and eavesdropping until we feel we 
know you. We forgot you don’t know 
us. I’m Moon. Used to have a more 
formal name but we’d best forget 
it. This is my dog, Dan.” 

“Eavesdropping?” 

“Toothpick spied on you. He has 
the circuits for it.” 

Moon gestured toward his spear. 

“Hi,” said the spear. “I’m Tooth- 
pick. Actually, your being here is my 
idea.” 

Moses stared at Toothpick — a ma- 
chine. A very sophisticated machine. 
Certainly not a class ten. 

“But why?” 

“We want you to come with us — 
live Outside.” said Toothpick. 

“Impossible,” said Moses. “Life is 
too short for me to spend it being 
hunted.” 

Moon handed Toothpick to Moses, 
saying, “Here, take him for a walk 
and let him convince you.” 



38 



GALAXY 



M oses carried Toothpick ginger- 
ly out of the cave. He passed a 
massive stone deadfall and stepped 
out under the stars. 

Toothpick said, “Don’t mind the 
way Moon talks and is. He has con- 
fidence in me because Tm so old. 
Actually Tm just a leftover cyber from 
the period when man had many of 
us. It was an age of high technology 
and low population density — man 
and his machines were all over the 
planet, in the sea and air — even off 
the planet, on the moon — other plan- 
ets — even the stars. “I remember 
those times very clearly. I must have 
been on stand-by for thousands of 
years — until Moon found me. My 
power sources seem well charged. 
Moon and I have been traveling to- 
gether ever since. He gives me intel- 
lectual company — a sounding board 
for my ideas. I try to protect him. I 
think we need you now — Moon and 
Dan are getting old. They’re both 
over two hundred — had their genetic 
clocks turned off so their tissues 
won’t age but the accumulation of 
scars is slowing them down. Their 
chances of surviving the next Hunt 
are small without your help.” 

Moses was watching the stars. He 
had heard of ancient experiments 
with genetic decoding. At first they 
were designed to find out why the 
four-toed humans made better citi- 
zens — docile, content. The gene locus 
that controlled initiative just hap- 
pened to determine five-toeism. A 
byproduct of the research was the so- 
called clock — that polycistronic RNA 
that translated the genetic message 
of life span from the gene to the mes- 
senger RNA. It was easy to make a 
synthetic virus — a sort of antigene — 



that knocked out the clock. One in- 
jection prevented your cells from 
knowing when they were too old to 
divide again. You could still be killed 
by any number of the usual acci- 
dents, neoplasms or infections — but 
senility never came. 

Naturally the clock project was 
halted when the implications became 
clear — there probably was a very 
good evolutionary reason for the pre- 
vious generation, dying off at a spe- 
cific age. Make room for the new. 
Moon and Dan were just relics from 
the past. 

“Did man ever reach the stars?” 
asked Moses. 

“I think so,” answered Toothpick. 
“My memory banks are small and 
what they do contain was put in a 
long time ago. A lot of it doesn’t make 
sense even to me. But I have a feel- 
ing that man did reach the stars 
before population pressures soaked up 
the space funds.” 

They talked through the night. 
Toothpick and Moon had walked 
over most of the major continents dur- 
ing the past thirty years. Conditions 
were about the same everywhere. In 
the tropical and temperate zones man 
had moved into underground shaft 
cities and cultivated every square 
inch of the surface. Vagabonds be- 
tween the cities were tolerated when 
their numbers were small but were 
cruelly hunted when they became a 
problem. 

Mankind was apparently making 
an evolutionary step with the ap- 
pearance of the four-toed Nebish 
and his hive culture. A few five-toed 
strains remained but they were most- 
ly outcasts like Moon. Five-toed an- 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



39 



cestors could also be found among the 
suspended who were waiting for some 
cure. 

Toothpick did not like this new 
Earth but, Moses reasoned, he was a 
machine and naturally would prefer 
a world where he could play a more 
important role than that of vagabond. 

At dawn Moon reset the deadfall at 
the cave’s mouth. It was a beautiful 
job of stonecutting — if you could 
ignore the gore long enough to ad- 
mire the precision of the counter- 
balance and the marble key. 

Locking the key with his foot. 
Moon said, “Don’t want anyone to 
get hurt while we’re away — ’’ and 
laughed. 

He picked up a ten-centimeter sec- 
tion of tube and attached it to Tooth- 
pick’s shaft. It had an optic pickup 
and had been set in the trigger area. 
Toothpick was more than a toy. 

Moon moved back to the fire, sort- 
ed through the scant rations and then 
tried on various articles of clothing. 

“This issue tissue certainly doesn’t 
last long,” he complained. 

He glanced at Moses’ kit, reas- 
sured himself that there was no need 
to divide. But he pocketed the food 
bars. 

He was ready to lead out when 
Moses gave him an argument. 

“Thanks for the invitation — but I 
won’t be going with you. It sounds 
like an interesting existence. I just 
don’t want to end my days as a crop- 
crusher and a fugitive — and certainly 
not as a cannibal,” he said. 

Moon flushed with anger. 

“Do you really know what you’re 
going back to? That secure position 
in your hive culture? What is your 
life really? You live alone with no 



possibility of changing your future, 
.lobs? Move the sewage or kill a psy- 
chotic. Love? Nothing. Don’t tell me 
about your Attendant back there. The 
only reason she pulled you down from 
that ladder was to save her share of 
your rations. Future? You have none. 
That hive culture is reproducing 
only the four-toeds. If you come 
with us you’ll have more children 
than you can count.” 

Moses winced. 

“Have jungle bunnies — little kids 
that would be hunted all their lives.” 

“It is better to be hunted than not 
to exist at all. Look, you owe it to 
the human race to try to pass on your 
genetic fifth toe— Toothpick thinks 
you were born with the bud of one. 
The hive culture is the end of the 
evolutionary line for man. The hive 
humans will survive hundreds of mil- 
lions of years as four-toed Nebishes. 
But it’s the end of the line. Nebishes 
can’t evolve. The hive is a living or- 
ganism — each individual unit is spe- 
cialized for one function. Even repro- 
duction and sex are separated. If one 
Nebish actually developed a gene for 
some higher trait he’d probably end 
up in suspension. It only took a few 
thousand years to get from the dis- 
covery of fire to space flight. In the 
next million years the hive will ac- 
complish nothing.” 

Moses glanced at the old man. 
Toothpick and Dan. 

He snugged up his shoulder har- 
ness and said, “Well, 1 came to see 
the other side of this mountain. 
Might as well take a real good look.” 

T WO humans, a dog and a cyber 
made the trip to the summit of 
the mountain. The view was encour- 



40 



GALAXY 



aging — naked rocks, ice, snow and an 
endless blue sky flecked with small 
white puffs of cloud. 

The old man waved proudly at the 
austere surroundings. 

“No cubicles above the ten thou- 
sand foot mark. We can take our 
time along this range. Farther north 
there is the remnant of a tree line — a 
few real soft woods and lots of 
lichens.” 

They crossed a saddle ridge. Moses 
got a glance westward, saw a valley of 
geometries. Monotonous tiered crops 
with their shaft caps and canals. Mil- 
lions of the four-toeds were living in 
darkness while Moses enjoyed the sun 
and the wind. 

He also learned. Toothpick tuned 
in on the agricultural robots and 
guided the group to food supplies. A 
few pounds of dried plankton gave 
them energy to reach the wooden to- 
matoes. A bedroll of those carried 
them into the grain fields. 

When they had to cross open 
ground they trotted briskly, staying 
fifty yards apart. The buckeye sen- 
sors paid little attention to single 
warm-blooded forms. Family-sized 
groups and larger were monitored 
closely for the Hunts. 

Moses saw his first family-sized 
enclave in the foothills — a pair of 
mated adults, a gray-haired female 
and three children. One of the chil- 
dren, a puberty-minus-one male, was 
dutifully guarding the approach path 
with a heavy spear. The adults 
glanced up from their clay bowls and 
flint tools as Moses, Moon and Dan 
approached. 

Communication proved unsuccess- 
ful. 

“Toothpick is having trouble with 



their dialect,” Moon said. “We’d bet- 
ter move on before there is a mis- 
understanding.” 

Moses wondered about the Stone- 
Age level of technology at which the I 
people were forced to live. Apparently 
the buckeye sensors could detect met- 
als at a much greater range than 
warm bodies alone. Any family that 
became “advanced” and started 
working with metal was soon Hunted 
out of existence. 

Moon led Moses to a canal a short 
distance away and showed him how 
to forage it. Soon they were seated on 
the bank, munching shellfish. A bulky 
robot straddled the canal silently — 
one of the irrigators. Moses pointed 
to the robot’s optic pickups. 

“Don’t we have to worry about 
that thing’s reporting us?” he asked. 

“Toothpick says that it’s only a 
class eleven. Goes around checking 
soil moisture and spraying water. No 
circuits for buckeye detection.” 

Toothpick put in, “We must watch 
out for class tens, though. Anything 
that can run around without a track 
usually has enough brains to detect 
us. Harvesters, Tillers, Metal Gath- 
erers — things like that.” 

Moses continued to munch thought- 
fully. The flesh of the shellfish had a 
definite crunchy consistency. It gave 
him a rich, full sensation. Lots of 
good amino acids. 

The water in front of him rippled 
noisily. He watched the spot. A large, 
ugly, humanoid head broke the sur- 
face, stared right at him and ducked 
under again. 

“If he comes up again, throw him 
a chunk of meat,” said Moon. 

Soon a noisy, splashing group of 
fat mammals came around the bend

of the canal. Moon stopped munching. 

“They look almost human,” Moses 
said. 

Moon nodded. Dan barked excit- 
edly and pranced up and down. Fi- 
nally he jumped into the water and 
began to play with the nearest crea- 
ture. The water mammal barked 
back. A tiny head, about the size of 
two fists, bobbed up and then under. 

“That one looked very human,” 
Moses said. 

Then he saw it again — a human 
child riding the back of a nonhuman 
dugong. The mother, a human female 
- puberty plus four — left the water 
and approached. 

Her wet clothes clung. Sullen and 
dark, her eyes were framed by a thick 
tangle of dark hair. Scum rimmed 
her chin and neck. She carried a 
wooden blade low in her right hand. 

Toothpick called, “Back out, men. 
1 detect a golden corpus luteum.” 

Moon Jumped to his feet and backed 
up to the bank of the canal, picking 
up Toothpick. Moses followed. She 
paused and watched Dan leave the 
water, shake and run after his hu- 
mans. Then she silently slipped into 
the water and crossed the canal be- 
low the surface. Moses felt a little 
sick when he realized that her under- 
water swimming was probably a de- 
fense reflex against Hunter’s arrows. 

“That was a coweye,” said Moon. 
“They are dangerous in the luteal 
phase. Toothpick watches their in- 
frared skin patterns. Hers was luteal 
or male. That means she’s ovulated 
and has no need to mate. The cow- 
eyes are friendly just prior to ovula- 
tion — during the follicular phase. 
Their infrared skin pattern is very 
female then. All the right capillary 



beds are being perfused and warmed 
up” 

Moses thought Moon was begin- 
ning to talk like Simple Willie. Had 
they met? Moon thought not.

UNTER CONTROL CENTRAL 
was quiet. Two monitors — Rook 
and Stan — studied the color changes 
on the large wall map. 

“Looks like the Harvesters are 
about finished with the Jay sector 
again. Do we have a team ready to go 
in?” asked Rook, the senior of the 
two. 

Stan picked up the three top folders 
from his desk and leafed through 
them. 

“No. Just a few partials here so far. 
The craft won’t be ready until tomor- 
row anyway. Only one of the buckeye 
detectors is operable on Doberman 
III. The tech thinks he’ll have it up 
to a one-mile range by morning — but 
there may be a lot of false positives.” 

Rook took the top folder and 
frowned. 

“Only one Hunter is in for a cate- 
gory nine — tactless achievement. We’ll 
never get those buckeyes cleaned out 
at this rate. I wish we hadn’t lost 
Bird Dog XVI. There was a good 
craft. He didn’t even need a category 
nine on the team to make a successful 
Hunt out of it. Look at this pitiful 
assortment — mostly threes and fours. 
They’ll never come back.” He pon- 
dered, then decided: “If a partial is 
the best we can do for Doberman III 
— that’s what it will have to be. Better 
send for this guy — category nine — 
what’s his name? Oh, Yes. Dag For- 
inger.”

F ORINGER put down his bow and 
pulled off his gloves. Wiping the 
sweat from his pinkish forehead he 
winced at the early sunburn. He felt 
he needed another couple of days on 
the range to sharpen his aim — but to- 
morrow was the big Hunt. 

Later, partially sun blind, he 
squinted around the office in Hunter 
Central. 

“You sent for me? I’ve still got a lot 
of practicing to — ’’ 

“Better rest up,” interrupted Rook. 
“This time tomorrow it won’t be 
padded targets you’ll be plinking at. 
You’ll need all the strength you have. 
Is your titrator working?” 

Dag touched the thumb-sized pump 
stitched to the skin above his left 
clavicle and nodded. 

“Had the skin tests for Speed and 
the M.W. too. Worked fine.” 

Rook and Stan glanced knowingly 
at each other. The skin tests were 
doses designed to give the Nebishes 
courage to face the outside. Extensive 
hypno-conditioning would otherwise 
be necessary. The drugs gave them 
instant courage — reckless courage. 
The Society-bred Nebish found the 
Outside very uncomfortable both phy- 
sically and psychologically. 

“Sit down,” said Rook. “We have 
some training tapes we want to go 
over with you. You can take them to 
your cubicle and study them later. 
But you’d better not waste any more 
energy on the range.” 

The wall map flickered off and a 
larger view of sector Jay appeared. 
Several bright lines and spots marked 
buckeye sightings. 

“The area for your Hunt is being 
harvested right now. Two hundred 
miles long and about five miles wide. 



One to two thousand feet elevation. 
Buckeye sightings — none today. But 
there have been eight in the previous 
week.” The screen flicked to action 
shots of a hovercraft lifting off the 
ground in a cloud of dust and leaves. 
“This is your ship — Doberman III. A 
loyal ship. Weak eyes but a good 
tracker. Reliable. Sit tight after your 
Hunt and he’ll be back to pick you 
up.” 

Rook paused to clear his throat. 

Stan took up the monologue: “Now, 
Dag. These views are taken from the 
recorder of a successful Hunter. You 
see that movement in the bushes. That 
is his prey. One of the buckeyes — a 
male, I think. This is his second day 
on the Hunt and the prey is fatigued. 
There — that was an arrow. He missed. 
Now, here in the open flatland we can 
see the prey better. Naked. It is a 
male and a young one, too. He must 
be two hundred yards ahead. Another 
arrow. A miss. Now it is night. The 
detector indicates the direction and 
distance of the prey. Note how patient 
the Hunter is — walking carefully in 
the dark. Dawn of the third day now. 
The prey is sleeping in that pollen 
hedge. There goes an arrow. Another. 
A hit. There goes the prey — dragging 
himself deeper into the hedge. This is 
particularly instructive. Note how the 
prey turns on the Hunter when 
trapped. Never relax until you’ve tak- 
en your trophy. Good shot of the tro- 
phy there.” 

The screen faded from action to 
stills. 

“These are some of the artifacts 
taken from buckeye camps. The ashes 
and charred bones are obvious. Primi- 
tives. Those were human and buckeye 
bones. This object is a bit worrisome 



HALF PAST HUMAN

here — the wooden spear. This one is 
broken but they can be over six feet 
long. With their fire-hardened tips 
they can be dangerous. They don’t 
contain metals — your detector can’t 
find them. Your arrows do show up 
on the detector. Don’t leave any be- 
hind. There are some examples of 
pottery and weaving — even ceramics 
of a sort. But no consistent pattern. 
Each buckeye develops his own cul- 
ture — living alone the way they do.” 
Stan concluded, “That’s it. Any ques- 
tions?” 

Dag Foringer wrinkled his sun- 
burned forehead and shrugged. 

“No.” 

“Well, get yourself down to the ga- 
rage and meet Doberman III. You’re 
the captain on this Hunt,” said Rook. 
Dag stood up. He started to leave. 
“By the way.” asked Rook. “What 
earned you this Hunt?” 

Dag smiled confidently. “Fluidized 
a tubeway and diverted it into the 
protein synthesizers. Saved thousands 
of man-hours. The Orange fault line 
moved twenty-three feet and cut into 
one of the branch lines of the S.W. 
tubeway. Fost over a million citizens. 
I was directing traffic that shift. Could 
have been a major loss in downtime. 
But I just waited until the life-support 
indicators moved out three decimal 
places and fluidized. Chances were 
that everyone was dead already — but 
an hour later they were just so much 
woven protein and the Pipe people 
could go down into empty tubes to 
make their repairs. When I went off 
duty the tubeways were running again. 
My efficiency won me a three Au-gram 
raise and this Hunt. Seemed so logical 
at the time. I’m surprized no one 
thought of it before. These tubeway 



breakdowns aren’t uncommon nowa- 
days- and sorting through the bodies 
for survivors always takes longer than 
the actual repairs. Efficiency pays, I 
guess.” 

T hat night Toothpick warned 
Moon and Moses to sleep in a 
tree. They hurried several miles to a 
sweet-thing orchard. Their rest was 
short-lived. A sea of white Agrifoam 
covered the ground for a depth of 
several feet — foam that carried nutri- 
ents and plant hormones to push the 
crop to early maturation. It was of 
some danger to humans. Toothpick 
guessed, since it was used to carry in- 
sect hormones, too — molecules that 
triggered permature metamorphosis. 
While these were probably still used in 
some areas, they varied; and the cyber 
was never sure what prolonged expo- 
sure would do to a human’s endocrine 
balance. 

The Irrigator went slowly by, 
drenching them. The foam vanished 
in the downpour. They finally got a 
few hours of sleep just before dawn. 

Moses breakfasted on the sweet 
things — orange, fist-sized fruits. Moon 
dropped from the tree, motioned 
Moses down. 

“Hunters,” announced Toothpick. 
Moon and Moses dropped flat and 
crawled to the eover of a drainage 
ditch. Even Dan crawled on his belly. 
Moon rolled over on his back and held 
Toothpick as high as he could. 

“Stay below the soil profile until we 
find out where they are,” he told 
Moses. 

Moses froze. He heard a rustling 
farther down the ditch. Something 
was moving in his direction. 

Toothpick scanned. 



44 



GALAXY 



“There it is — a hovercraft. Must be 
a Hunt, the way they’re circling that 
hilltop. About three miles away.” 

The noises in the ditch were closer. 
Moses glanced up and saw a pair of 
eyes looking back — coweyes. 

“They’ve flushed something,” an- 
nounced Toothpick. “The craft set 
down for a second and now it is mov- 
ing away at a higher altitude. They 
probably dropped off one of the Hunt- 
ers.” 

The craft disappeared over the dis- 
tant ridge. Moon and Dan crept up to 
the edge of their ditch to watch. 

“Quiet back there,” Moon whis- 
pered. 

“Sorry,” whispered Moses. 

Several minutes passed. 

“There he goes,” said Moon point- 
ing down the valley. 

A naked figure running easily moved 
into the open and swerved toward the 
ditch. 

“It’s a buckeye all right — and some- 
thing sure is chasing him,” said Tooth- 
pick. 

The fugitive passed them about a 
half-mile away and turned toward the 
canal. When he reached it he ran 
smoothly along the bank, apparently 
in no hurry. Then the Hunter came — 
new suit of green-and-brown camou- 
flage — and the bow. He was fat and 
puffed loudly. Suddenly he stopped, 
took a deep breath, paused a few sec- 
onds, ran on smoothly. 

“Speed,” said Moon. “That buck- 
eye is in for a good workout.” 

Moon dropped back into the ditch, 
explaining, “That Hunter will be 
awake and tracking for three or four 
days — on Speed. At the end of his 
Hunt that little pump on his neck will 
inject the M.R.— Molecular Reward. 



His body will be virtually torn to pieces 
by that much exertion but old M.R. 
will keep him euphoric until the craft 
returns and — Say! There’s a coweye 
back here.” 

Toothpick interjected, “It is okay. 
She’s in the follicular phase.” 

Moses partially untangled himself 
from her arms and legs. 

“1 found out,” he said sheepishly. 

H er dialect was fuzzy but she was 
easy to understand. She led them 
to her nest in the bank of the canal. It 
was a little foxhole lined with dry 
leaves. A two-year-old female child 
napped in it, warmed by the sun. For 
the rest of the day the mother dove for 
shellfish for the group. Moon played 
with the little kid. Moses spent the 
night in the nest with her. Moon, 
Dan and Toothpick stretched out at a 
respectable distance. Privacy — a lux- 
ury as rare as love — since both disap- 
pear when crowding distroys the 
meaning of sexual signals. 

At dawn Moses was euphoric. Moon 
found him diving for their breakfast. 
The pile of shellfish was growing to 
banquet size. 

“You’d better leave a seed zone,” 
said Moon jokingly. 

Obviously Moses had been sexually 
imprinted on the young coweye. It 
would be painful when the luteal 
phase came and drove them apart. 
Recent evolutionary adjustment had 
favored the females who mated briefly 
and traveled alone. Family groups 
attracted Hunters. As soon as her cor- 
pus luteum reassured her that ovula- 
tion had passed she would have no 
further use for her mate. In fact, he 
would be a real hazard. 

“I’m staying,” said Moses. 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



45 



She busied herself serving the men 
and feeding her child. 

“I know,” said Moon simply. 

He allowed himself a brief appraisal 
of the female — good bone structure, 
clear skin and well fleshed out. A 
healthy one. 

“We’ll move on. Remember to stay 
below the profile of the bank. You 
don’t want to attract Hunters here 
with a two-year-old. See that ridge 
about ten miles away? Toothpick tells 
me there is lots of safe cover just on 
the other side. We’ll probably rest up 
there for a couple of weeks. If you 
change your mind, we’ll be there.” 

“I’m staying.” 

Moses put an arm around the little 
female and hugged her briefly. 

Ten days later he caught up with 
Moon and Dan in rough country. Dan 
wagged his tail three times. 

“She changed,” Moses said, per- 
plexed. 

Moon nodded. No comment was 
necessary. He had explained the hor- 
mone cycle before. 

“She was so in love, I thought. So 
tender. She was so soft — her mouth, 
her fingers — so soft.” 

Moses remembered Simple Willie’s 
mumbles about the most beautiful 
thing in the world. It must have been 
like that for him, too — love. 

“But it wasn’t love. It was just hor- 
mones.” 

“Don’t say just hormones, boy. That 
was the best kind — old, basic love. 
She wanted to have your kid and she 
loved you. She loved you with every 
molecule in her body. That’s how it is. 
You can’t sit down and reason love.” 

“Why couldn’t she let me stay with 
her? I could help feed her and the 
kids — protect her — help with the 



childbirth — ” 

Moon shrugged. 

“Maybe you could have — one day. 
But not now. The Big ES has no room 
for family units. This is her way of 
surviving. Try to forget it for now.” 

R ook stood in the garage as Do- 
berman III returned. He didn’t 
like the light, easy way the old craft 
maneuvered — almost effortlessly — as 
if it were carrying a small load. When 
it set down he walked over through 
the dust and opened the hatch. Dag 
was alone — thin, tan and stained with 
chlorophyll. He climbed out stiffly, 
then reached back in and picked up 
his cubed trophy. 

“Got one. An old toothless female. 1 
was on the trail of a nice young buck 
— followed him for almost two days. 
She started stalking me on the second 
night. Dangerous too — had this mean- 
looking wooden knife. Here, 1 have it 
right here. By the time I got rid of her 
I couldn’t find the young one.” Dag 
reached into the cab again. “Odd,” 
he said. “She was wearing these beads. 
Thought 1 saw a similar string of 
beads on the kid, too— must be a 
charm — same tribe or clan. Got some 
good optic records. You can add them 
to your teaching files.” 

Dag Foringer gathered his gear and 
left without a word about the other 
Hunters who had not come back. 

Rook patted Doberman III on his 
dust cover. 

“Any idea where the other Hunters 
are?” he asked. 

The old mech turned an optic cata- 
ract on his chief from Hunter Control 
and answered brokenly, “Put them 
down on buckeye spoor — routine. 
Covered eleven hundred miles. No 



46 



GALAXY 



sign. Their beacons are silent.” 

Rook might wonder — but Moses 
and Moon knew. 

T O FORGET was easy in cow 
country. Moses came across an- 
other follicular phase or two every 
week. Hunters came and went — occa- 
sionally enjoying Molecular Reward 
— occasionally they themselves be- 
coming hunted. By winter Moses had 
covered over a thousand miles with 
old man Moon, Dan and Toothpick. 
They worked like a unit now. Sur- 
viving. 

“Harvesters,” alerted Toothpick. 
Moon and Moses paused on the 
edge of a wide belt of moist, freshly 
turned soil. Robot Harvesters moved 
along the opposite side, devouring the 
grain — leaves, stalks and all. The line 
of Harvesters seemed endless — rising 
over one horizon, disappearing below 
the other. By dusk the reaped belt 
was more than ten miles wide. The 
robots quieted as dew dampened the 
crop. 

“Let’s go across. We can’t go 
around — and if we wait until the new 
crop is planted and grown we’ll be- 
long in the open,” Moon said. 

Grain offered little cover. 

The going was slow through the soft 
soil. The group passed between the 
line of harvesters several hours later. 

“Won’t their buckeye detectors pick 
us up?” Moses asked. 

“Probably,” Moon said. “But it 
takes days to set up a Hunt. Tooth- 
pick will eavesdrop on their usual 
wavelengths. We’ll know in plenty of 
time if any hunters are on the way.” 
When they came to the firmer 
ground they started to trot through 
the uncut grain. A quarter moon gave 



plenty of visibility. The scene seemed 
peaceful. 

“Hunters. Throw me,” Toothpick 
shouted softly. 

They were coming to a quiet or- 
chard. Some of the dark shapes were 
not trees — they were bowmen. Moon 
tossed Toothpick into the air and Dan 
started to bound toward the nearest 
figure. Bowstrings hummed. Tooth- 
pick suddenly emitted large white 
sparks that bleached out Moses’ visual 
purple. While he was trying to regain 
his night vision he heard the sickening 
impact of an arrow with flesh. Some- 
one yelled from the trees and Tooth- 
pick crackled again. Moses knew 
blackness and blinding pain, heard a 
loud ringing, felt a facefull of grain. 

Fearful of the trophy knife, he 
fought his way to consciousness. His 
face was warm and sticky with blood. 
Time had passed. The eastern sky had 
grown light. Nothing moved. He sat 
up. 

Moon lay curled around the feath- 
ered end of an arrow — a red arrow- 
head protruded from his left lower rib 
cage. His open eyes expressed puzzle- 
ment. 

When Moses moved Toothpick 
called, “Quick, pick me up. There are 
more Hunters behind the trees.” 

Moses staggered toward the sound 
and found two bowmen near Tooth- 
pick. Small charred spots marked 
their uniforms over their precordial 
areas. He picked up the cyber. The 
Hunters did not move. 

“Over to your right. Let’s check 
them out,” said Toothpick. 

Moses moved cautiously past the 
still bodies of Dan and another Hunt- 
er. Several yards away he found the 
hovercraft. Four more Hunters were 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



47 




stretched out on bedrolls, enjoying 
their Molecular Rewards. 

“They look harmless enough — for 
now. Pick up their bows and try to 
find a medi-repair-kit in their gear. 
Stay away from the hovercraft. It is 
a class ten and capable of defensive 
action,” said Toothpick. 

Moses returned quickly to the old 
man’s still form. He put a tentative 
hand on Moon’s neck and felt a pulse. 
The old eyes focused angrily. 

“Yes — I’m alive. Although I don’t 
know how. This damned arrow almost 
got me dead center. Have you got 
anything to cut off those barbs so 1 



can pull it out? I can’t lie here for- 
ever.” 

Moses took one of the wicked tro- 
phy knives from one of the cooling 
bodies and carefully sawed through 
the red arrow shaft under Moon’s left 
arm. 

Moon tied one end of a roller ban- 
dage to the shaft and began to coax 
out the feathered end. As he drew out 
the shaft the ribbon of bandage was 
pulled into the exit wound. He paused 
to let the woven fibers dampen, then 
pulled some more. When he had the 
arrow out he had a length of bandage 
running through the track. He tied 



48 



GALAXY 




the two ends of the bandage together. 

“I heal up real good if I don’t get 
infected. This should keep the wound 
open until healing starts. Can’t risk 
an abscess.” 

He coughed. Red mucus bubbled. 

“Dan?” the old man said, crawling 
to his dog. 

The dog’s golden teeth were locked 
into the throat of a Hunter. A few 
inches of arrow protruded from the 
dog’s wide chest. It jerked rhythmi- 
cally. Moon moved Dan off the dead 
Hunter and examined him. He patted 
the dog’s head. The tail did not move. 
Both hind legs were extended straight 



out, motionless, stiffly unnatural. 

“At least we know where the arrow- 
head is,” said Moon. He watched the 
dog for a moment, then looked up. 
“Say, Moses — better get that scalp of 
yours sewn up. All that fresh air is 
bad for your skull.” 

Moon cleaned the younger man’s 
scalp wound, freshening the edges 
roughly. Then he began to sew, talk- 
ing as he worked. 

“Wish the Tinker was here. He’s 
pretty good with stitches. There, now 
— lie down for a few minutes while I 
check out that hovercraft.” 

He was gone a long time. When he 

49 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



returned Moses noted that his left 
foot was stained bright pink. Moses 
did not have to look into the Hunt- 
er’s camp to know what had hap- 
pened. 

Moon walked over to Dan. The 
feathered tip of the arrow still 
twitched. 

“Good dog,” he said. “You killed 
the bastard.” 

He patted Dan’s head. The tail did 
not move but Moses knew that it was 
wagging in higher centers. They rigged 
a travois for Dan and moved deeper 
into the orchard. Moon’s pain dou- 
bled him up frequently and Dan’s 
hind legs remained paralyzed. That 
night they decided to split. 

“Dan and I will have to hole up for 
a while,” Moon said. “You’ll have to 
help Toothpick complete his mission 
by yourself.” 

The old man vomited up a small 
amount of black, granular mucus. He 
gently pulled the length of bandage a 
short distance through the wound. A 
small spurt of similar cloudy material 
drained from the anterior opening. 

“Rather have it draining out where 
1 can see it. That way I know it isn’t 
pooling up and getting infected in- 
side.” 

M oses felt helpless. Dan lay 
quietly on his side. A dry red 
line matted the fur on his neck and 
chest. The old man talked to the dog 
in a monotone broken by coughs. 

“Good dog. You killed the bastard. 
Want a drink, Dan?” 

He repeated the words over and 
over. 

Moses looked at Toothpick. 

“And 1 was supposed to protect 



him,” he said sadly. 

“My error,” said Toothpick. “The 
Hunters had their communicators off 
— it was the end of the Hunt. But I 
should have been more careful around 
any harvested area. I know that’s 
where the bowmen are.” 

Moon scowled. 

“Forget it. They still came out sec- 
ond best. We’re alive and they’re 
dead.” He added softly: “There were 
three trophies in the craft — freshly 
cubed. One was a kid.” He turned to 
Moses, “Your warm body isn’t doing 
any good around here. It will just at- 
tract more Hunters. Get going. Take 
Toothpick wherever he’s headed.” 
Moses backed off a few yards, say- 
ing, “Rest here a while. Moon. Tooth- 
pick and I will forage a bit.” 

Later he told Toothpick, “Can’t 
just go off and let them die.” 

“It’s what they want.” 

“I could run to the nearest shaft 
city for aid. They’d send a team of 
medi-attendants right out and — ” 

“And suspend the lot of us. Dan 
and Moon don’t want to end up 
hooked to one of their damn sus- 
pension machines.” 

Moses nodded. He knew Moon 
would trade a few days in the fresh 
air and sunshine for a few years of 
vegetating in some underwater sus- 
pension coffin. He gathered armloads 
of fruit and returned to Moon and 
Dan. Moon had hooked the travois on 
his shoulder and crawled into the sta- 
men hedgerow. Moses found man and 
dog covered with pollen under a 
screen of branches. 

“Thanks for the fruit. This is a 
pretty safe spot for now — low enough 
— and nothing here to harvest. Let 



50 



GALAXY 



VII 



me check that scalp. Looks fine. Wash 
it whenever you can. Now get out of 
here.” 

Moses gave him a wry smile — Moon 
did not like sentiment. 

“We’ll be traveling north by north- 
east. Catch up if you can,” Toothpick 
said coldly. 

Moses traveled slowly for the next 
several months, looking back fre- 
quently. No one tried to catch up. 

Running alone was lonely. Moses’ 
skin had thickened and tanned. 
Weather did not bother him as it had 
when he had first discarded his in- 
sulated climbing suit. His muscles 
had firmed. He gave several Hunters 
a good run and then slept while 
Toothpick stood guard. In three or 
four days the Hunters’ muscles were 
completely lysed by their drug-stimu- 
lated exertion. On one occasion 
Moses actually doubled back on a 
Hunter and witnessed the Molecular 
Reward — a placid, hallucinatory state. 
The Hunter was completely cut off 
from his environment and helpless. 
Moses could understand why the mor- 
tality rate among Hunters was high. 

He moved through cooler lands 
now. Food was scarce. Toothpick al- 
ways suggested a course that took 
them in a straight line — thirty degrees 
east of north. It was late autumn 
again — another year, another thou- 
sand miles. 

“Harvested as far as 1 can see,” 
Moses said. “Looks like we’ll have 
to turn south if we want to eat again.” 

Toothpick ruminated. 

“We can foray into that shaft city 
if we’re quick about it. The doors are 
only class twelves. I’m a class six.” 



H e approached the city 

through rows of misty plankton 
domes. Blobs of sticky scum marked 
the previous passing of a Harvester. 
It had been skimming the ponds. It 
would be a week before the ponds 
were ready for skimming again. He 
followed the Harvester’s tracks right 
up to the blank face of the shaft cap 
— ten yards of wall broken only by 
baleful optics and the huge doors to 
the Agrimech garage. The grill above 
was dark. 

Moses stood for a long moment at 
the door before it opened. He tight- 
ened his grip on Toothpick as he 
stepped into the nest of machines. 

“Are they suspicious?” he whis- 
pered. 

“Just sluggish. We’re just another 
item in their memory banks unless we 
cause loss of life or materials. Try to 
get to the inner wall and find a door 
to the spiral walkway. Watch out for 
those little service robots. Some are 
blind. This isn’t the safest place for 
a soft-skinned human.” 

The powerful Agrimechs slept in 
their bays while small Servomechs 
worked. Some dangled from ceiling 
cables while others sat on the floor 
surrounded by new and used compon- 
ents. The outer wall was strewn with 
broken parts and vegetable debris. 
Moses picked his way until he came 
to an inactive bay he could safely 
cross. 

Moses melted into the apathetic 
crowd on the spiral and softened his 
face to match the surrounding lethar- 
gy. He matched their sluggish gait. 
Toothpick remained silent until they 
reached the first dispenser. 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



GALAXY 51 



“Let me handle this. Your Au- 
grams have probably been confis- 
cated," said Toothpick. 

The dispenser issued one item of 
each food category and an issue-tissue 
garment. Moses staggered away under 
the load. 

"Caution." Toothpick made a hiss- 
ing sound, “The lighting is changing. 
Some shorter wavelengths are coming 
in. The scanners must be looking for 
the melanin and carotenoids in your 
skin suspecting you’re from the Out- 
side." 

Moses continued to walk with the 
crowd. 

“Was it the dispenser?” 

“No. For all it knew we were just 
one of the maintenance teams. It 
might have been your clothes — tat- 
tered and carrying plant pigments— 
but 1 doubt it. Your infrared skin 
pattern probably triggered the analy- 
sis. Your months exposed to weather- 
ing has thickened your skin and added 
pigments. Your skin is a better insula- 
tor now and it reads lower on the 
thermal scale than the citizens here,” 
Toothpick explained. Moses quick- 
ened his pace. 

Several hours later they were Out- 
side again, back on their north-north- 
easterly course. 

More weeks of travel brought them 
into colder country. They invaded an- 
other shaft city to obtain food and 
more layers of issue-tissue to insulate 
Moses against the frozen nights. Food 
production in this zone was entirely 
greenhouse, since both environmental 
heat and energy for photosynthesis 
had to be provided. They saw little in 
the way of foodstuffs— just the misty 
dome walls sweating frost on their 
insulated outer surfaces and other 



long lines of glowing green tubes pul- 
sating with cultures of plankton. The 
ground was permanently frozen here. 

Moses huddled against an outcrop- 
ping and reached under his outer layer 
of clothing for his water bag and a 
food bar. 

“Smell some brine in the wind,” he 
said, drinking. 

Toothpick was propped against the 
rock. Fie flexed his membrane charge 
and rotated his optic toward the east. 

“We’re getting close to the sea. The 
haze blocks the horizon at your wave- 
length but I can see the shore- about 
seven miles.” 

Moses chewed slowly. 

“Not much sign of life around here. 
Just the machines making food.” 

Toothpick rotated and looked at his 
human. 

“And expensive food, too. The en- 
ergy cost per calories is prohibitive. 
These units would be much more 
efficient in a tropical sea.” 

Moses watched the pulsing green 
flow through the warm transparent 
pipes. It was easy to picture the same 
setup in a less hostile environment- 
lush coral reef or even the bottom of 
the ocean along the equator. The job 
of setting it up would obviously fall 
on his own caste— the Pipe people. 
He looked at Toothpick and shrug- 
ged. 

“In theory it would be easy but in 
practice 1 found we were just too 
short of skilled Pipes. The four-toed 
Nebish is a docile citizen — but not too 
many of them long to crawl inside a 
sewer or a pump. Our caste is just 
barely capable of keeping present 
machinery functioning. New projects 
are impossible until we get more 
Pipes.”

GALAXY 



“Five-toed Pipes." 

Moses chewed thoughtfully for a 
moment. 

“Five-toeds? Where can the Big 
ES find five-toeds? There aren’t 
many left on the planet— except for 
the 1 people. And they’re not really 
suited for this population density.” 
Toothpick flexed restlessly in the 
frozen air. 

“Come on. I’ll show you some five- 
toeds." 

M oses picked him up and they 
moved on toward the odor of 
brine. At the seashore an underground 
tubeway surfaced at a dock on the 
frosty tidal flats. A robot boat was 
taking on a load of man-sized sau- 
sage casings. They climbed on. 

The boat, a twin-hulled thirty- 
footer, had its bulge of neurocircuitry 
at the top of a short mast. The open 
cargo space contained a score of 
eight-by-three-by-three-foot casings. 
Each casing was attached to a small 
console by a segment of tubing. 

“Looks like a cargo of live melon 
vines or something,” said Moses 
lightly. He leaned against one of the 
casings while he tried to see through 
its opalescent skin. The pressure of 
his elbows slowly pressed into the skin 
until he met something firm. He 
stepped back abruptly, almost drop- 
ping Toothpick. 

“What’s in there?” 

“You’re about to find out. Here 
comes another human being. Try to 
open the casing. 1 think there’s a 
latch at the end opposite the tubing.” 
Moses crouched and glanced to- 
ward the bow. A human bundled in a 
thick, hooded suit was walking from 
casing to casing with a checklist. 



Moses fumbled with the latch and 
lifted off the top of the casing. 

“A body — ’’ 

“No. A patient. Quick. Get inside.” 

The angry sea lashed the cargo 
deck with spray. The casings 
squeaked against each other. Moses 
crawled into the casing and let the lid 
snap shut. 

Silence. He squirmed for comfort. 

Later he snapped the lid open an 
inch to allow stale air to blow out. 
The whitecaps were still tossing foam 
onto the deck. The hooded figure was 
gone. 

“Where is she?” 

“She’s below deck in the Attendant 
cabin — enjoying a nice hot drink and 
music and looking female.” Tooth- 
pick was eavesdropping on the boat’s 
life-support circuits. “We’ll be en 
route for a day and a half. You might 
as well catch some sleep. Stick me 
out under the lid. I can keep an optic 
on things and give you some some 
air.” 

Moses tried to relax. 

“Are you sure this guy is alive? 
He feels so cold.” 

“He’s alive — in suspension. But 
he won’t be for long if you go to 
sleep on his tubing. That coil carries 
his perfusion fluids. He doesn’t me- 
tabolize much at this temperature — 
but he is still metabolizing and those 
tubes exchange ions and gases with 
the sea water. You can’t press on 
them for more than a few hours at a 
time.” 

Moses rolled over and gently 
moved the coils of two-inch trans- 
parent tubing up on the patient’s 
chest. One end was fixed to the head 
end of the casing. The other entered 
the patient’s leg just above the knee. 



HALF PAST HUMAN

A similar tube ran into him from the 
opposite side. 

Moses slept while Toothpick 
scanned. 

T he second day out they began 
passing frequent masses of drift 
ice and spotty fog banks. Moses shut 
the lid when they came to a floating 
dock. Machines off-loaded. 

Moses saw the silhouette — like that 
of a giant praying mantis — approach. 
Its two big arms cradled Moses’ cas- 
ing, unmindful of the increased 
weight. Two smaller arms worked on 
the perfusion tubing — unhooking it 
from the boat’s L.S. console and at- 
taching it to a smaller unit on the 
back of the robot’s mantis abdomen. 
The offloader rotated its head, turned 
carefully on the wet deck and moved 
onto the gently rolling dock. 

Moses watched the vague shadows 
through the translucent skin of the 
casing. The robot rolled on wide soft 
wheels up a long ramp and into a 
cavelike hallway. The stability and 
quiet told Moses that he must be in 
a hollowed-out cliff overlooking the 
sea. Probably on an island hidden 
from the dock by the fog. 

An hour later he was rocking gently 
in a quiet dark water with thousands 
of other casings. Moses popped his 
casing lid for air and was drenched 
with icy brine. He left the casing, 
waded around in waist-deep water 
feeling for the wall the echoes told 
him was there. The tangle of perfus- 
ion tubes tied up his feet and shifting 
casings blocked his path. The cold 
cut through his thin issue-tissue 
clothing. 

Toothpick produced a beam of 
visible light that enabled Moses to 



grope his way to a ladder. Dripping 
and shivering, he stood on the walk- 
way looking over the acres of casings. 

“This section has recent cases,’’ 
Toothpick said. “Probably all four- 
toeds. Let’s check deeper in the tidal 
caves. The older cases should be back 
that way — to you* right.” 

Moses moved on — teeth chattering. 
He found an Attendant’s unoccupied 
chamber and turned up the heat. 
After changing clothes and drinking a 
liter of hot broth he felt stronger. 
They moved on. 

T his looks likely,” said Tooth- 
pick finally. Moses stood out- 
side an Attendant’s chamber which had 
seen many years of use. The door 
handle was worn smooth by the thou- 
sands of hands which had come for 
the magic warmth inside. “The con- 
trol boards will be close by. Try along 
that far wall.” 

Rows of tiny green lights covered 
the wall as far as Moses could see in 
both directions. 

“Must be a million lights here,” 
Moses said. “What do they mean?” 

“A million patients in suspension. 
Green means the patient is alive. 
Yellow stands for trouble. Red is for 
dead.” 

Moses settled down in the warm, 
comfortable quarters while Toothpick 
checked the memory banks of the 
Life Support center. This section held 
just under a million patients. The 
most recent cases were from the year 
of Olga fifteen-twenty-four. Most 
were from before 1220 A.O. 

“High incidence of five-toeds 
here,” said Toothpick. 

“How do we proceed?” 

“Insert me into one of those sock- 



54 



GALAXY 



ets over there. Then you try to get 
out of here. The Big ES isn’t going 
to like what I have to do. There will 
be security personnel all over this 
place as soon as they figure out we’re 
here.” 

“You want me to leave you?” 

“I’m a kamikaze Toothpick — ex- 
pandable. I have to stay until it’s 
over — ” 

“What’s over??” 

“Oh — oh. Company.” 

A hooded figure entered, suspecting 
nothing. The protective suit was thick 
and relatively soundproof. It carried 
its own entertainment channels. The 
lone Attendant for millions of sus- 
pended had little need to be extra- 
curricularly alert. 

While Toothpick worked quietly in 
his socket, Moses crept up on the new 
arrival. He grappled with the loose- 
suited form. 

“Tie her into that chair with some 
tubing and tell her to be still or I’ll 
zap her,” said Toothpick. 

“Zap?” 

“Never mind. I heard him — or it,” 
the Attendant said, relaxing. “I don’t 
know why you’re here — but if you’ve 
brought your own rations you’re wel- 
come. It gets pretty lonely around 
here — Say! What’s going on? Look 
at those yellow lights on my panel. 
There must be a dozen of them — ” 

“Tie her up,” said Toothpick, 
twitching in the socket. 

She sat open-mouthed while yellow 
lights sprang up all over the panel. 
A few times she wrenched at the tub- 
ing but Toothpick immediately made 
threatening sounds in her direction. 
Moses warned her quietly that Tooth- 
pick was no ordinary machine — he 
had killed four-toeds. 



The frost melted from the chamber 
windows. The distant sounds of fall- 
ing icicles echoed against the damp 

stone walls. The first red light ap- 
peared — a death. 

The Attendant struggled against her 
bonds, spitting hatred at Moses. 

“Murderer! What right have you to 
come here — killing my patients? Why 
in the name of Olga are you doing 
this?” 

Moses watched the red light glow. 
He was puzzled. These patients were 
mostly five-toeds, according to Tooth- 
pick. Why was Toothpick fooling 
with the L.S. controls? He was killing 
them. 

T oothpick recorded the pecu- 
liar set of Moses’ features but he 
was too occupied to explain. All his cir- 
cuits were busy with environmental 
controls — altering incoming sensor 
readings to give ice-age temperatures 
to the L.S. mech brain, which in turn 
began to heat the perfusion fluids to 
compensate. Slowly the waters 
warmed. With each seven Fahrenheit- 
degree rise the metabolic rate dou- 
bled. The perfusion pumps strained 
to supply oxygen and nutrients to 
compensate. Robot Resuscitators 
splashed awkwardly about in the 
shallows, trying to save a few of the 
thousands who were sickening in the 
accumulating metabolic wastes. Even 
the air Moses breathed began to 
smell of ammonia and urea. 

More red lights appeared. Harvest- 
ers moved through the tidal caves 
picking up the deceased and carrying 
them to the synthesizers. The protein 
wasn’t wasted. 

The Attendant continued to vilify 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



55

Moses with passionate asperity. 

“What are you — some crazy cru- 
sader? Well, this is not a psychotic 
ward, you know. It is a cancer ward. 
Those patients have organic diseases 
—tumors. Why are you killing 
them?” 

More red lights flashed. 

The Attendant tried reason. 

“If you are an assassin — why kill 
them all? Tell me whom you are after 
and I’ll help you find him.” 

Moses frowned at her. Expediency. 
She would finger one victim to save 
the rest. He looked expectantly at 
Toothpick, who seemed more relaxed 
now that the red lights were appear- 
ing. 

The cyber spoke from his socket. 

“We’re not assassins come to pre- 
vent our political enemy from being 
resuscitated. We do not intend the 
death of anyone — but unfortunately 
many will die. Moses, you’d better 
leave. If they find you here you’ll 
be tried for mass murder. Take her 
with you. I’ll need three more days 
to complete my work here. I won’t 
be able to come with you.” 

Moses hesitated. 

“Couldn’t I wait? Together we 
might be able to — ” 

“No. I can fool this one L.S. robot 
by sitting right in his sensory unit — 
but the other nine robot brains on 
this island are probably already pick- 
ing up the increased heat. Their sen- 
sors are free. The warm air and water 
from this section will alert them. 
Should take at least two days for any- 
one on the mainland to get here — 
maybe three. After that the place will 
be sealed. If you’re linked with it,j 
you’ll be found. Big ES is very effi- 
cient that way.” 



M oses carried the Attendant 
lightly on his shoulder as he ran 
for the dock. The boat — a mere class 
ten — accepted his verbal orders with- 
out question and accepted him 
aboard. 

“Thousands of red lights — ” the 
Attendant sobbed. 

The boat seemed to tremble with 
her crying. Moses motioned for her 
to be silent. Her eyes brightened. 
She spat at him. Scowling, he 
grabbed the front of her suit and 
twisted it in his fist. 

“Go ahead,” she told him. “You 
were real handy back there in the 
Dundas Caves — killing sleeping pa- 
tients. You’re not man enough to kill 
someone who is awake and looking 
at you.” 

The boat trembled off course. He 
jerked her to her feet and lifted her 
over his head. Through the cloth he 
felt her heart race. Her elbows were 
still secured behind her. He stepped 
to the rail and let her watch the gray, 
ice-flecked sea rush by. 

She screamed insults at him. Her 
heart rate increased. He glanced into 
her face, saw bright eyes, a wet 
mouth. She was enjoying this — a 
masochist! 

Moses dunked her into the icy 
brine and held her up to the cold 
blast of the wind. She fell silent. 

He carried her below decks. The 
boat plowed a steady course south. In 
the warm cabin — bundled, dry and 
quiet — the Attendant held a hot cup 
of broth with both hands. Moses 
stood before her, shaking his fist. 

“You’re crazy — you know that? Re- 
peat that hysteria and you’re going to 



GALAXY 



get hurt. Now just sit tight. I'll give 
Toothpick the two days he needs — 
then I’ll let you go. Meanwhile you’re 
stuck on this boat -with me. It’s up 
to you whether you take a regular 
bath in that ocean out there.” 

She eyed his sinewy, tan forearm 
and licked her lips. A moment later 
she was on him, tooth and nail. She 
drew a little blood but as the struggle 
progressed around the cabin floor he 
detected a definite sexual quality in 
her attack. 

Two long, hard days ensued. The 
light in her eyes continued in the ha- 
tred zone. Fortunately all her energies 
were directed at Moses and not at the 
boat’s neurocircuitry. Their course 
through plankton farms and floating 
mechanical factories was smooth. 

On the third day the boat turned 
abruptly westward. 

“No,” Moses told it calmly. 
“South.” 

The Attendant smiled smugly 
through her ecchymosis. 

“This trip is no longer authorized. 
Try your muscle on Security.” 

He reached for the manual override 
and was knocked down by a bright 
spark . 

“Field’s on.” She grinned. “Boat 
has heard the long-distance call. 
We’re going to dock somewhere.” 

When they docked he picked up a 
spanner and shouldered his way 
through the lethargic Nebish guards. 
The tubeway crowds could not hide 
him. His cutaneous melanin and caro- 
tenoids marked him. He wrestled a 
new set of issue tissue from one of the 
crowd but still the optic pickups fol- 
lowed him easily. At buckeye wave- 
lengths he was umber against a mauve 
background. Days of pursuit followed 



— during them he had no time to sleep. 
He stole food from daydreaming 
Nebishes as they left the dispensers. 
Whenever he dozed the security peo- 
ple closed in. Capture was inevitable. 

“Open up!” he shouted to the door at 
the top of the shaft cap. “Open up. Let 
me Outside.” 

The baleful optic stared. 
“Unauthorized,” it announced. 

A class twelve door — and it blocked 
his escape. 

W hen he awoke in his cell the 
viewscreen showed an old man 
and a dog moving through a snowdrift. 
Moon and Dan. Moses watched the 
screen for several minutes before he 
realized it was the court computer 
simulating his crimes. 

A chill went down his spine as he 
searched in vain for the gas inlets. 
Then he remembered that the walls 
were semipermeable membranes — 
they sweated toxic through radicles. 
He slumped into his chair. A large 
unappetizing meal covered the table. 
The viewscreen moved on to scenes of 
aquatic canal mammals and Agrifoam. 
Now there were three forms on the 
screen — Moses, Dan and himself. 

He saw little errors of detail — and 
some errors that were more than de- 
tails. Toothpick was sometimes miss- 
ing. In some scenes Moon or Moses 
carried a staff or a spear. In others — 
nothing. Obviously the sensor records 
were spotty and the computer was fill- 
ing in the gaps in information. The 
readings were taken at a great distance, 
he guessed from the fact that Moon’s 
and Dan’s teeth were white. 

The final scenes taken in the tidal 
caves were quite sketchy. Evidently 
Toothpick was able to block most 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



57 



sensor readings in the section where 
the murders actually took place. There 
was even some doubt as to the inno- 
cence of the female Attendant. Obvi- 
ously the court computer knew noth- 
ing of Toothpick’s abilities and there- 
fore suspected that the Attendant 
must have assisted Moses. It knew 
that Moses’ background in the Pipe 
caste did not equip him to do alone 
what had been done. 

He relaxed a little. Even his own 
biased eye could see many defects in 
the case against him. Where was his 
defense? The computer ended its simu- 
lation with the death statistics — a 
quarter of a million had died. A simi- 
lar number had survived and were 
again safely resuspended — but another 
quarter of a million were still in doubt. 
Hundreds of Resuscitators were on the 
scene. The final count might be days in 
coming in. Big ES would push for a 
public execution on this one. 



H e paced nervously around the 
small cell, sat down again in the 
only chair — a seven-course meal and 
the viewscreen in front of him. His last 
meal? 

The screen cleared and the face of 
an eager young man appeared — unus- 
ually eager for a Nebish. 

“I am your Defense Attendant — 
Josephson. Can we talk?” 

Moses nodded. 

“You are being tried as a mad-dog 
killer,” said Josephson glancing at his 
notes. “We will use the standard de- 
fense — M.M.S. — the Mass Murder 
Syndrome. Your blood is being 
checked for the ectodermal-debris- 
antibody right now. As soon as the re- 
sults are available the computer will 



decide. Should be over in less than an 
hour.” 

Moses fingered the puncture wound 
on his arm. The Mass Murder Syn- 
drome? Surely he was not insane. He 
watched quietly as Josephson began 
his argument. 

“Moses Eppendorff was born with 
the bud of a fifth toe and with it he car- 
ried the gene for the ectodermal-de- 
bris-antibody. The antibody with 
which evolution equipped mankind 
for his struggles in the era of the in- 
dividual. In the past it was useful in 
spreading mankind over the surface of 
the planet. Individuals cultivated forty 
acres each or took their fishing boats 
out alone. Crowding caused anxiety in 
the five-toed humans. Alone, they 
prospered. Crowded, they died. The 
court must recognize that free will does 
not play a role in the M.M.S. An in- 
dividual with five toes — or even the 
congenital bud of five-toeism, as in 
this case — can not be crowded without 
forming antibodies against the ecto- 
dermal debris of his fellow humans. 
Loose hairs, scales of skin cells, drops 
of skin oils all drift into the environ- 
ment and stimulate antibody produc- 
tion — an allergy against humans. High 
density population causes it in all but 
the hive species — ants, bees, termites 
and the four-toed Nebish do not be- 
come allergic. They can be crowded 
into the more efficient hive society — 
but men with five toes cannot. They 
develop the allergy — and the antibody- 
antigen reaction causes anxiety — anx- 
iety that precipitates murders, suicides 
and abortions. 

“Living in the cloud of ectodermal 
debris causes the antibody formation 
— cell-fixed, ‘atopic’ antibodies. Each 
new exposure to the ectodermal anti- 



58 



GALAXY 



gen causes the release of a serotonin- 
like molecule at the cell wall — the site 
of the antigen-antibody reaction. This 
serotonin-like molecule causes anxiety 
— molecular anxiety — the level of 
which varies with the individual. Some 
handle the anxiety well or convert it 
into psychosomatic diseases. Others do 
not handle it well. In these persons 
anxiety precipitates neuroses — or 

psychoses. The only escape is in flee- 
ing the cloud of ectodermal debris — 
but at our population density this is no 
longer possible.” 

The court computer took over. 
“Enough. The court is fully aware 
of the role of society’s cloud of ecto- 
dermal debris in the precipitation of 
psychoses. Moses Eppendorff, how- 
ever, lacks the antibody in question. 
The test results are now available.” 
Josephson looked perplexed. Evi- 
dently he had planned no alternative 
defense. 

“But — but if he isn’t insane why — 
why did he kill a quarter of a mill — ” 

He stammered to a halt, his ques- 
tion unfinished. 

“Yes. Why?” asked the viewscreen. 

It took Moses a moment to realize 
that the court computer was speaking 
directly to him. Sensors in his room 
would detect autonomic clues if he 
lied. He swallowed carefully, wonder- 
ing which version of the truth would 
be safest. A few wrong words now 
would close his case with a roomful of 
bad gases and the court would move 
on to its next case. 

“My name is Moses Eppendorff. I 
have been Outside for almost three 
years — but I’ve never killed anyone. 
My crime was traveling with Tooth- 
pick — a class six cyber. Toothpick 
says he is over two thousand years old. 



I’m sure he had a good reason for — ” 

“There is no record of a class six 
cyber in your travels,” said the court 
computor. “Where is your Toothpick 
now?” 

“He remained behind in the tidal 
caves. He isn’t mobile. Your security 
people probably have him now.” 

There was a long delay while all 
the details of his story were checked. 
The screen switched to a workshop. 
Moses saw a group of technicians 
bending over a segment of tubing that 
had been opened lengthwise. Three 
homogeneous cylinders were exposed 
— as peas lie in a pod — one quartz, one 
black and one white. One of the faces 
in the group looked up. 

The court asked: “The device left in 
the L.S. unit at the murder scene — 
have you analyzed it?” 

“From its function we’ve guessed 
that it is a simple frequency converter 
— changing the thermister readings 
from warm to cold or cold to warm. 
There are many ways it could have 
been designed but so far we’ve been 
unable to make any sense out of this 
device. It must be a very primitive 
design, one not covered in our training 
exercises.” 

Moses stared at the screen. Tooth- 
pick lay open and nonfunctioning. The 
court asked him to identify it. Moses 
did. 

“My sensors tell me you are telling 
the truth. But your concept of the truth 
does not conform to reality. Your 
Toothpick is not a high order of cyber. 
It is merely a simple device that alters 
temperature readings. The smallest 
portable cyber is a class ten. A class 
six weighs a ton. And that doesn’t in- 
clude a self-contained power source. 
Obviously this delusion is real to you. 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



59 



I will accept your plea of insanity.” 
Josephson relaxed. Moses sputtered. 
The screen faded to a dull white and 
mumbled something about final dis- 
position of the case being put off until 
tomorrow. 

A bout an hour later Josephson 
appeared at the door to Moses’ 
little cell. He seemed excited. He car- 
ried a long bundle under his arm. 
Moses motioned him in. Pushing sev- 
eral of the dishes aside they placed the 
bundle on the table and unwrapped it 
— Toothpick. 

“Court wants you to have what is 
left of your — device. Trying to classify 
your delusion, 1 guess.” 

Toothpick’s long open case was 
empty. The three cylinders rattled 
around loosely in the soft white cloth 
wrappings. Moses’ face registered pain 
at the sight of his cyber’s innards. He 
opened his mouth to speak. 

Josephson cleared his throat noisily. 
“Court will try to classify your — 
problem — as metabolic or due to some 
sort of conditioning.” His glance 
around the room reminded Moses that 
his behavior toward Toothpick was 
probably being recorded for use in this 
classification. “Can’t let all this go to 
waste,” Josephson picked up a chewy 
protein disc from Moses’ last meal. 
“A little dry.” He sipped one of the 
tall colored drinks. “Probably sus- 
pend you as soon as you’re classified.” 
Josephson continued to sample the 
stale food. Moses absently picked up 
the cylinder that resembled quartz. It 
fit sympathetically and like a baton 
into his palm. Eyeing it analytically, 
he noted strange lights playing over 
its inner layers. Did they denote hope? 
Remembering where Toothpick’s optic 



pickup and visible light beam had 
been located, he placed the quartz in 
the shell near the point. Trying to 
make his actions casual, he picked up 
the black cylinder. 

The damned cylinder was not exces- 
sively heavy but it had a massive 
inertia. He could move it slowly wher- 
ever he desired but sudden movements 
met solid resistance. He made small 
talk with Josephson while he guided 
the cylinder into the shell. First he 
tried the black at the end and the 
white in the center. Then he reversed 
the positions— and got exactly nothing 
With all three cylinders in place, 
Toothpick’s innards still featured a 
six-inch gap. Moses could not be sure 
where the gap had to be located or if it 
represented a missing cylinder or other 
part. 

After several tentative experiments 
at positioning, Moses tore strips from 
the cloth wrapping and tied them 
around Toothpick. The outer skin was 
pliable — but sprang open each time he 
pressed it shut. He set Toothpick down 
and stretched out on the cot. 

“Thanks for the snack.” Josephson 
again glanced at the unseen sensors. 
“Get some sleep. I’ll see you first thing 
in the morning.” 

Moses let him out and shut the door. 
He stood for a long time staring at the 
door — then he collapsed on his bed, 
face down. His mind was all geared for 
self-pity. He could expect death or 
suspension at the hands of the court 
— and he was so young, had barely 
tasted life. 

Suddenly his line of thought was 
frozen by what he saw. Toothpick’s 
shell was closed. Had Toothpick’s 
spirit returned? He was afraid to look 
again.

J osephson sat in a small booth, 
speaking softly to the court. 
“Anything incriminating?” 

“No,” answered the cybernetic jur- 
ist. 

They both watched Moses lying on 
the cot. The bio-lectrics indicated he 
was still wide awake. 

“Anything on his contacts?” 

“I transmitted a pickup on his 
neighbor — William Overstreet — who 
has a record of having been Outside 
and killing a fellow Hunter. He will be 
transported here to stand trial with 
Moses if his interrogation is positive,” 
answered the machine. “The three of 
them — a triple execution. It’ll take at 
least that to close this case.” 

Moses rose and walked to Tooth- 
pick. Josephson perked up. 

“What’s he doing?” 

“He appears to be hugging and kiss- 
ing that device,” the court computer 
answered. “His physiological parame- 
ters show a level of excitement ap- 
proaching irrational behavior — and 
I’m detecting a magnetic field. Could 
that device still be functioning?” 

“I don’t know. Perhaps the field is 
caused by a battery of some sort. Your 
technicians found no circuitry. But 
don’t let his irrational behavior fool 
you. He’s as sane as you or I.” 

Moses relaxed on his cot. Toothpick 
on the pillow beside him. He faced the 
wall and touched his teeth to Tooth- 
pick’s outer skin — bone conduction 
carried a faint voice to his eighth cran- 
ial nerve. Toothpick was alive. 

“Moses. My memory was damaged 
by the crude surgery on my skin. 1 de- 
tect a large number of sensors in this 
room. Danger. You must keep my 
functioning secret. Court is a class six 



but his circuitry is very primitive. 
Technology has regressed along with 
the reverse evolution of your species 
— squeak.” 

Moses waited for Toothpick to be- 
gin speaking again. His heart raced. 
The court and Josephson were puzzled 
by the autonomic response. Biolectric- 
als jumped all over the screen. A class 
twelve dial moved from true to false. 

S IMPLE WILLIE sat fondling his 
cube, his unfocused gaze aimed 
through the wall. Five security atten- 
dants crowded into his tiny home and 
asked about Moses. Almost four years 
had passed since Moses had left. Willie 
had trouble with memories that old. 

“He used to live next door,” 
prompted one of the intruders. 

Willie’s face registered a question, a 
smile, a question again. Memory mac- 
romolecules stirred. A tear welled in 
Willie’s left eye and clung to the lashes. 

“Moses? Yes, I knew him. He used 
to talk to me a lot. He was my friend. 
Henry lives there now. Henry isn’t 
anyone’s friend.” 

“Reading in the Tee zone. Some 
confusion and psychogenic overlay,” 
a deep voice mumbled in the back- 
ground. It sharpened. “Willie, did 
Moses ever discuss the Outside with 
you?” 

Willie froze. Little warning reflexes 
were activated deep in his basal gan- 
glia. 

“That’s it,” announced the deep 
voice triumphantly. “Reading way 
over in the panic zone. Bring him 
along.” 

S HE sat stiffly in her cell, heaping 
curses on Moses and denying ve- 
hemently that she helped him. Joseph-

son enjoyed watching her squirm un- 
der the repeated grilling, knowing that 
she knew the workings of the court. 
Any question might be the last if her 
answer — or nonanswer — tipped her 
bio-lectrics into a pattern that fit the 
crime profile. 

“Ask her if Moses ever touched 
her,” he prompted, leering at her skin 
resistance tracing. 

“Only to kill me,” she spat. 

Skin resistance dropped but the 
needle stayed on Tee zone. The court 
puzzled over the readings. 

T OOTHPICK’S sonic whisper 
tingled Moses’ teeth. 

“Ask about the fate of the other 
third — the patients who are alive and 
unsuspended. They should be cured of 
their neoplasms. Assume the posture 
of a faith-healer come north to cure the 
suspended masses. Smile and think of 
the Hip of Mount Tabulum. You are 
now the seer of Dundas Harbor. You 
have awakened a quarter million hu- 
mans and cured them of their diseases 
— cancer.” 

Over and over Toothpick repeated 
the instructions until Moses’ cortex 
accepted them as fact. Acceptance was 
made easy by the fact that he had al- 
ready witnessed Toothpick’s spirit 
leave and return. The role of a prophet 
was simple for a man who had held a 
cyber that had brought hundreds of 
thousands back from the brink of 
death. 

Moses stood up and shouted, 
“Where are my children? My follow- 
ers? Bring them to me.” 

IX 

T he scene in the Hearing Room 
began to unfold. Moses entered, 
wearing a torn bedsheet as if it were a 

62 



flowing robe. He waved Toothpick. 
The viewers were reminded that the 
plea was insanity. 

The female Attendant’s vitriolic at- 
tacks and Willie’s cube-fondling 
complete the picture. But when Moses 
began his tirade about the thousands 
he had brought back from the dead — 
and when the court acknowledged 
that many of the rewarmed patients 
were apparantly free from tumor — 
worldwide interest grew. 

The oncologist twisted his pointer 
nervously until the court finally 
called on him. 

“And would you tell the court how 
you can be sure the tumors are gone.” 

“We can never be sure that every 
single tumor cell is gone but that is 
not important. What is important is 
that all significant tumor masses are 
gone. This membranogram shows a 
patient before cancer. The different 
shades of red reflect energy levels of 
tissues— bright heart muscle, lighter 
skeletal and gut muscle, pink liver 
and kidneys, yellow brain and almost 
black bones. Note the homogeneous 
patterns — the sparks of muscle move- 
ment. Now here is a patient with can- 
cer. The membrane-scan picks up a 
coarse hot nodule. In this case it is in 
the lung. The tumor has a higher en- 
ergy level -busier tissue — and an ir- 
regular outline. This is a later scan. 
The small grains of light are tumors 
spreading down the lymphatic chan- 
nels. The body’s defenses are losing 
and the tumor has broken out. Now 
you see necrosis in the tumor — this 
black central area is dead cancer tis- 
sue. The bright rim is viable, grow- 
ing cancer. The bull’s eye or so- 
called doughnut pattern is diagnos- 
tic.” 

He paused to let the demonstration 

GALAXY 



sink in. While viewers watched the 
time-lapse scans the little grains 
spread, grew to large bull’s-eyes with 
dark, necrotic centers. 

The oncologist continued: “In 

some cases the tumor can grow and 
replace a large per cent of the pa- 
tient’s tissues. But even in these 
early cases the tumor’s increased me- 
tabolism and irregular outlines give 
it away. Tumor nodules are easy to 
see — and when they are gone, they 
are gone. That is why they are not 
being resuspended. They no longer 
have cancer by our tests — so their 
suspension equipment will be used by 
others who need them.” 

Big ES grew alert to the restless 
masses of Nebishes who exclaimed, 
“A miracle — a new prophet has arisen 
in the Evergreen Country.” 

The court pressed for a scientific 
explanation. 

“How do you explain these cures?” 

“Heat,” said the oncologist. 
“Raising the temperature causes the 
metabolic rate to rise. Tumors already 
metabolize faster than normal tissue, 
so they are more vulnerable to heat. 
The respiratory enzymes specifically. 
The enzymes that transform carbohy- 
drates to energy. They double their 
reaction rates for each seven-degree 
rise — Fahrenheit. The mitochondria 
burn themselves out first. This has 
been known since the year one thou- 
sand Before Olga. Ancients used hot 
baths to cure pelvic tumors and fever 
therapy for all manner of neoplasm. 
The treatment is risky — note the mor- 
tality rate in this Eppendorff episode. 
The results have always been about 
the same — one third cured, one third 
mortalities, one third left with their 
tumors. The high death rate has tak- 
en heat out of current therapy — we 



are using suspension and waiting for 
a safer cure.” 

The court ruminated on the math. 
A third killed — a third cured. The sta- 
tistics balanced. The charges of mur- 
der could be dismissed. But another 
crime seemed to be shaping up — 
250,000 persons had been restored to 
activity and life and now they must 
be fed and housed. Fifty shaft cities 
would have to squeeze in an extra 
ten per cent — an impossibility. Max- 
imum use of resources had been 
reached a long time ago. There was 
not room for a single person, let alone 
a quarter of a million. 

“Perhaps if you were to resuspend 
the cured patients for starvation, un- 
til more calories can be found,” the 
court suggested. 

The oncologist objected. 

“Impossible. There is no prece- 
dent.” 

Josephson obtained permission to 
speak. 

“These patients are mostly five- 
toeds. They would not survive in our 
shaft cities at the present population 
density. They all speak different dia- 
lects from their past centuries. 1 sug- 
gest that they be allowed to go Out- 
side. They don’t have the Nebish 
phobias — they’ll be happy out there. 
Big ES should not try to accept re- 
sponsibility for their sustenance. Mo- 
ses warmed them up — let him lead 
them Out. They can drift south of the 
fifty-oh-oh line into the yellow-corn 
or the red-apple countries. Some of 
the patients are old and do not have 
many years of life left. Their prob- 
lems will solve themselves — Outside.” 

The court liked the prospect of al- 
lowing Society’s problems to walk 
away under their own power. It or- 
dered the Synthesizer to speed up the 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



63 



processing of the quarter of a million 
who had died in the rewarming. Mo- 
ses would need the woven protein and 
fat cubes to feed his following it was 
post-harvest time Outside. 

T he patients filed out, squinting 
at the sunlight. White-haired 
and bald they came. Young and mid- 
dle-aged they came. Some limped, 
others had raw sores where skin tum- 
ors had disappeared. They formed a 
living, drifting mass about a mile 
wide and four miles long —contract- 
ing at night for warmth and expand- 
ing during the day to forage in the 
freshly turned soil. 

But they were made up of individ- 
uals I people. 

Hugh Konte watched the stars in 
stoic silence. His Edna was no longer 
with him. His memory had recorded 
poorly during the years prior to his 
suspension and he no longer was sure 
of when he had lost Edna. She had 
once been full of love, youth and vig- 
or. He rubbed his neck. The hard 
nodule was gone. So were the other 
symptoms that had marked his term- 
inal illness — yellow skin, red stools 
and the growing bubble of fullness in 
his belly. His cancer had vanished. 
Only itching, tender areas remained 
where proliferating fibroblasts re- 
placed necrotic tumor. 

The world had changed while he 
slept. He waited and watched — a 
sack of foodstuffs on his back, plowed 
soil under foot. Strangers crowded 
around him. Inside him nothing had 
changed. He was a man. Five years 
old or fifty — he would carve out his 
own little kingdom. 

At dawn he picked his way through 



the herd into the younger, more vig- 
orous crowd that was walking point. 
Hugh sought the leader. A lean ecto- 
morph sprinted out into the lead, 
hesitated and faded back into the 
mass of fugitives. A burly male spoke 
loudly until he realized he was ac- 
quiring a following. Hugh looked into 
a thousand faces and saw nothing but 
uncertainty. The burly male fell si- 
lent. The ectomorph scurried about, 
exploring. But no one seemed to lead. 
Footsteps followed footprints— south. 

Moses and several others sifted soil 
as they walked, searching for possible 
fragments of food overlooked by the 
Harvesters. They found only bits of 
lignin and cellulose left as a mulch. 
Some pieces were moist, chewable 
and contained a few drops of some 
plant juice but most were spongy and 
invaded by soil organisms. These in- 
edibles, garnered during the day, 
were fed into smoldering campfires at 
dusk. These little fires, started by 
Toothpick’s arc, marked the social 
units into wliich the mass of humans 
was fragmenting. 

At night Moses sat in a circle of 
dusty faces around their pile of pink 
coals — bright eyes reflected. Stars 
blinked overhead. 

“Need more combustibles?” -dsked 
Hugh, walking out of the darkness. 

He handed Moses a fist-sized, 
moldy tangle of roots. 

“Find a soft spot and sit down.” 

He set the clump of roots on the 
coals and watched the bright white 
sparks play over it as the dry mycelia 
flared up. Soon the roots were burn- 
ing with a steady yellow flame. Moses 
talked of the harsh realities of life on 
the Outside.

Hugh said finally, “I suppose we 
should be grateful the Big ES hasn’t 
used Agrifoam while we're here. At 
least we can sleep at night. But no 
crops —no food.” 

“The court wants us south of fifty- 
oh-oh by the end of the month. Our 
food supply should last until then. 
There’ll be crops below the line.” 
“Wouldn’t it be better to split up 
into smaller groups right now?” 

“Toothpick says to stay in the cor- 
ridor. The way through here straight 
and quick. The Cultivators will be 
working on both sides. Don’t want to 
offend the court.” 

Hugh stood up. The horizon to the 
south was dotted with shaft caps. Be- 
hind him the caps were surrounded 
by the sleeping multitude and their 
glowing camp fires. 

“We’ll have to split up eventually. 
Your description of the I people isn’t 
too inviting, but it’s better than 
suspension. Funny. When 1 was sus- 
pended 1 was the head of a big in- 
dustrial complex — my own empire. 
Now?” He thrust his hands deep into 
his pockets. “Things certainly do 
change in a few hundred years.” 

He nested in the dirt around the 
dying coals and slept. 

R umors of food below the bor- 
der stimulated a brisk pace the 
following morning. Moses and Hugh 
worked their way around the right 
flank and watched the mass flow by. 
An hour later they joined the strag- 
glers bringing up the rear. Canes and 
crutches were numerous here. The 
stragglers fell farther and farther be- 
hind us the day wore on. Limps grew 
worse. Crutch tips sank into soft 
earth. At dusk the main body camped, 



ate and fell asleep while the stragglers J 
caught up. [ 

“A lot of these aren’t going to make | 
it,” said Moses softly. “I saw some | 
swollen ankles that I’m sure won’t be i 
able to cover tomorrow’s thirty miles • 
- and we have almost a month of this ■ 
pace to reach the border on time.” 

Hugh nodded. Some distance away 
were little groups of cripples who had j 
given up. They huddled together in 
the darkness, miles behind. Having [ 
lost family and friendship ties while j 
in suspension, they were unable to I 
form new ties during the hurried ex- i 
odus. Now they were arbitrarily j 
grouped with the infirm of similar 
di.sabilities — each unable to help the ! 
other. j 

“1 know the Big ES doesn’t want 
to accept the burden of feeding all of j 
us — but surely the stragglers won’t ! 
be allowed just to die of starvation.” | 
Moses, who had been on the Out- 
side long enough to know, nodded in 
agreement. 

“No one starves to death any 
more.” < 

Hugh did not like the ominous | 
tone in Moses’ voice. | 

Before dawn the main body of the | 
travelers was awakened by distant 
screams. Thousands of heads popped ■ 
up from their earthen pillows. Fright- j 
ened eyes strained back through the 
darkness of the trail covered the day ^ 
before. Fuel was added to the small ! 
fires. Silence fell. Then screams rose 
from a different spot in the dark- i 
ness. These did not stop. Someone ! 
was approaching the group of camp- 
fires — someone moaning and weeping 
loudly. 

A large hulk of a man limped out 
of the darkness, carrying a spindly 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



65 



old man in his arms. The sounds 
were coming from the small, frail 
form. The big man and his burden 
collapsed at the nearest fire. Wetness 
glistened in the firelight— blood. 

“Some deviate shot ,^an arrow into 
Ed,” lamented the huge acromegalic. 

Moses saw that the shaft went right 
through the victim’s thigh. He ripped 
open the trouser leg and tried to stop 
the bleeding while the giant related 
the story over and over. 

“ — and while Ed was screaming 
this —deviate — came up carrying a 
bow. He took out this little knife and 
tried to cut off— With Ed screaming 
and all the blood -1 guess I lost my 
head and killed him. Pushed his face 
right down into the dirt and kept push- 
ing.” 

The giant seemed so shocked by his 
own brutal behavior that Moses as- 
sumed he had been a very gentle man. 
His acromegalic features- giant head, 
hands and feet — gave him a very for- 
midable appearance but he was in 
many ways helpless. His joints were 
large and inefficient — so arthritic and 
stiff that he had not been able to keep 
up with the main body of fugitives. 

Later the wounded man slept — ane- 
mic and weak. 

“Hunters.” Moses handed the 
bloodied arrow to Hugh. “I’ve been 
wondering if the court’s decision gave 
us any protection. This little episode 
removes any doubt. We’re all fair 
game as long as we're Outside.” 

Voices rose up around the campfire. 

“What’ll we do?” 

“Let’s fight. Acromegalic killed one, 
and he’s a cripple. They can’t be so 
tough.” 

“Fight? With what — dirt?” 

“We have this for a start,” Hugh 
said, holding up the arrow. “Let’s 

66 



backtrack and find the damn bow.” 

The cold body of the Hunter lay at 
the attack scene — his head buried in 
the loose soil. They picked up the bow 
and his kit — food bars and the trophy 
knife. Moses stomped on the buckeye 
detector while it was still on the wrist 
of the corpse. A trophy was already in 
the Hunter’s bag. Agrifoam closed 
over the scene and they had to wade 
three miles through the fluffy stuff to 
get back. The corridor was still dry. 

At dawn the ma«s started to move 
again — more slowly this time, so there 
would be no stragglers. An occasional 
Hunter approached within bowshot — 
let his quiver of arrows fly into the 
anonymous crowd and then sat by 
until the mob moved on, leaving its 
dead. Moses tried to intercept the 
Hunters but four square miles of hu- 
mans was just too big an area to cover. 
By sundown the fugitives had three 
more bows and a dozen arrows but 
they had lost more than twenty of their 
fellows. 

“Survival is impossible under these 
circumstances,” Hugh observed. 
“Let’s test our environment. We’re 
going to need weapons and food. What 
would happen if we kidnaped a couple 
of those big machines that come out 
and work the land during the day? 
Can Toothpick tell us how to disable 
their communicators so they’ll obey 
us?” 

Moses glanced at Toothpick, who 
was still held together by bandages. 

“Squeak -1 think so,” said the 
cyber. “Neurocircuitry is usually 
color-coded a myelin-yellow. If you 
pull the antenna it should put a class 
ten on voice command-mode. 
Wouldn't hurt to try. They wouldn’t 
deliberately harm a human.” 

In the days that followed Moses 

GALAXY 



commandeered a score of the lumber- 
ing Agromechs. Sallies into the shaft 
cities produced tons of foodstuffs. The 
hive culture of Big ES didn’t know 
what to do with an army — the first 
army on the surface of the planet in 
thousands of years. 

R ook shouted into the viewscreen, 
“Josephson, you fool — what have 
you done? We’re scarcely able to han- 
dle an occasional buckeye down here. 
We can’t spare one Hunter — let alone 
a hundred.” 

Josephson smiled cruelly. 

“This is our chance for a really big 
Hunt. Thousands of trophies. Don’t 
limit yourself to Hunters. Use super- 
visory personnel. Remember, they’ll 
be crossing fifty-oh-oh next month— 
but they could be crossing forty-oh- 
oh two months later. The horde could 
settle right in your territory — just for 
the climate. You don’t have our harsh 
winters. If we don’t stop them soon 
they may be too strong to stop.” 

Cass whispered to Rook, “Cotton- 
white is mobilizing twenty craft. 
They’ll be at fifty-oh-oh in two weeks.” 
“Okay. Count on Orange-sector for 
twenty dogs — ah — craft. We’ll do our 
best.” 

X 

T he Tiller lowered its appendages 
and turned over a couple of feet of 
soil. Moses and the two bowmen were 
vibrated from their comfortable seats 
on the upper chassis. 

“Stop that. You don’t have to do 
anything to the soil. Just hurry along 
and take us to point position at the 
head of the column,” commanded 
Moses. 

“Sorry, sir. Right away, sir,” barked 
the mech. 

HALF PAST HUMAN 



Appendages up, it sped along. 
“Those last three shaft cities were 
completely empty. Even its own citi- 
zens looked half starved,” Hugh com- 
mented. 

“The Big ES is going to try to starve 
us out. It doesn’t care if it takes a few 
of its own loyal subjects with us. Don’t 
worry about those Nebishes — they can 
just hop into the tubeways to get food 
outside of our area. We don’t dare en- 
ter the tubes — the human monitors 
would fluidize them in a moment and 
we’d be just so much woven protein.” 
“Our supplies are running low.” 
“Fifty-oh-oh is just ahead. Tooth- 
pick says there is plenty of food there.” 
The Tiller lumbered off ahead of the 
horde. The horizon was cluttered with 
socio-political moraine — ^jumbled 

boulders and skeletons of derelict 
Agromechs that marked the border at 
50:00. 

“And we’ll get there none too soon,” 
said Hugh. “A few more days and we’d 
be loosing people to hunger.” 

The horde quickened its pace but 
came to a stop at sundown — still a 
half-day from its goal. 

“Sent some runners to scout ahead,” 
commented a group leader on the left 
flank as he and other organizers set- 
tled down around a campfire. “It was 
easy to get volunteers — there are few 
rations in camp tonight. The runners 
were anxious to see the bountiful crops 
Toothpick has promised us.” 

Noisy Agromechs patrolled the peri- 
meter of the huge encampment. 

“Bountiful — food. Squeak,” said 
Toothpick. “Many of my circuits were 
damaged. Memory shot full of holes. 
Squeek! Bountiful food at fifty-oh-oh.” 

D awn brought the return of the 
scouts. 

67 




“Ambush! There’s an army waiting 
for us. If we want the food we’ll have to 
fight for it,” said the first scout. 

“How many?” asked Hugh. 

“Thousands. Almost as many as we 
have.” 

Hugh glanced at Moses question- 
ingly. Toothpick squeaked. Other 
scouts came in with a similar story. 

“What choices do we have?” asked 
Hugh. 

Moses said, “Hold everything a 
rninute. How were they dressed? 
What equipment did they have?” 

One scout said, “No equipment — 
just lots of spears. Their uniforms 
were tattered. Looked like an experi- 
enced army, though.” 

“Let’s ride down and have a closer 
look in the daylight,” suggested Moses, 
climbing up on the Tiller. 

The sun was still low on the horizon. 
Mists hung in the east. A group of 
twenty archers filed along behind the 
Tiller as it trundled toward the line 
of stones and dead machines. As the 
advance guard moved closer a large 
number of heads popped up behind 
the barrier. 






68 



GALAXY 



The Tiller ground to a halt. Moses 
held up Toothpick. 

“Any communicator information? 
What are they planning?” he asked. 
Toothpick scanned. 

“No communication.” After a mo- 
ment’s silence he added: “Ball is here. 
We’re meeting the Hip and his fol- 
lowers from Mount Tabulum. Those 
people are buckeyes.” ' 

“Buckeyes? Like us?” 

The two armies faced each other, 
bristling with suspicion. Moses’ horde 
had machines and the technical ability 
to use them. The Hip’s buckeyes were 
physically stronger but outnumbered. 
Their males and females alike carried 
weapons. Jungle bunnies whimpered 
at coweye breasts. 

J OSEPHSON sat in his hovercraft 
over the horizon and watched the 
two armies on the screen. 

“A third of a million trophies,” he 
said. The hovercraft were gathering in 
the valley behind him. Hunters, half 
drugged and half hypnoconditioned, 
did not even notice that they were 
Outside. Tunnel vision and myopia 
kept their phobias untriggered. They 
checked their gear. Large quivers were 
foaded with arrows. 

Jbsephson searched for a channel to 
Rook in the Orange sector ships. 
“What is your E.T. A.?” 

“Be there in three days,” answered 
Rook. 

He led his squadron rapidly up a 
canal to the next refueling point. Me- 
chanics struggled to keep the ships 
together. 

Three days was an optimistic guess. 

M oses faced the Hip over a 
campfire in the neutral zone be- 
tween the armies. 



“What brought you here?” 

“Food,” said Hip. “Ball has been 
leading us farther North with each 
feeding. There is supposed to be plen- 
ty of food at fifty-oh-oh.” 

“Food is what we came for, too. 
There’s nothing behind us but plowed 
earth. The food must be on your side.” 
Hip shook his head. 

“The land is freshly harvested on 
our side, too. The Ball and Toothpick 
must have made a mistake.” 

The Hip spoke sadly. His bald head 
was bowed toward the fire. He was si- 
lent so long that Moses began to think 
he had fallen to sleep. 

“They’re just machines, after all,” 
Moses said. “We’ll Just have to make 
the best of things. Hunters have been 
harassing us off and on. If we cooper- 
ate we can have a pretty secure peri- 
meter at least. 1 don’t know what we 
can do for food. Raid the shaft cities 
fora start, 1 guess.” 

The first day of the truce went 
smoothly. Buckeyes knew the Agro- 
mechs — having lived with them in 
their fields — but they were amazed 
when members of the horde from Dun- 
das demonstrated their presuspension 
skills at repair and maintenance. They 
transferred energy from one mech to 
another — even raided a garage for 
more power. One of the class twelve 
doors on a nearby shaft city had been 
disabled and the Agromechs used its 
power outlet. 

“Unauthorized. Unauthorized.’ 
shouted the door. 

The mechs with their human riders 
filed in for recharge. Moses and a cou- 
ple of bowmen stood about — alert. 

“Another Toothpick is near,” said 
Toothpick. 

Moses shielded his eyes against the 
glare of the sun outside and scanned 



HALF PAST HUMAN 



69 



the fields. Far in the distance he saw a 
familiar figure- a lean old man carry- 
ing a spear. Beside him hobbled a dog. 

“Moon and Dan," Moses said in- 
credulously. 

Moses walked out to meet Moon, 
brought him to where the action was. 
The two Toothpicks eyed each other. 
Moon lapped the frame of the dis- 
abled door and smiled. His golden 
teeth glinted in the sun. Moses noted 
the increased bulk on the old man’s 
frame. He had been eating well. His 
dog, Dan, looked fit also -except that 
his left hind leg ended at the tarsus 
and his tail did not wag. The right leg 
looked well enough and the rest of 
Dan seemed even belter muscled than 
before. A star-shaped scar marked his 
chest. 

After advising Moon of the situation 
Moses added: “The Hip is here, com- 
manding his buckeye forces.” 

Moon frowned. 

“He may be the Hip to you but he’s 
just the Ass at Tabulum to me. Any- 
one who’d start a religion with a cyber 
Just so he doesn’t have to gel out and 
scratch for his own keep is no damned 
good.” 

Moses said, “Now, now. Looking 
after thousands of hungry people is no 
easy task. I know. I’ve got a lot of hun- 
gry followers myself. And right now we 
all could do with a little food.” 

Moon cursed, said, “Why, there is 
always plenty of food around. Lend 
me a squad of these bowmen and I’ll 
get you all you can eat.” 

“But we’ve been all through this 
shaft city — and the others in the area. 
There just isn’t any food. The Nebishes 
themselves are starving.” 

Moon smiled. Moses remembered 
seeing the same wicked smile in the 
cave after his Climb. 



“Of course it won’t be properly 
aged.” 

Moses winced. Well, if matters had 
to come to that— he would still sur- 
vive. 

“Okay, Moon. I’m sure cannibalism 
would be all right with the Hip’s peo- 
ple. Mine may be a little reluctant at 
first — but there seems to be no choice 
right now.” 



T hat evening the leaders sat 
around the campfire and dis- 
cussed harvesting the shaft city. 
Hugh took it surprisingly well. 

“I suppose we can rationalize it— 
since man is a carnivore and since he 
is practically the only animal life 
form left on the planet. It follows that 
if he is to eat fresh meat at all —it will 
have to be — ” He pau.sed, tried again. 
“Of course, if we accept the premise 
that the four-toed Nebish is actually 
a different species — then we’re faced 
simply with a problem in logistics. A 
hundred thousand pounds of meat a 
day will keep our people from starv- 
ing. A full shaft city should last us two 
months. Then we could put up a 
blind at the mouth of the tubeway 
and hunt the tube passengers.” 

Hugh drew diagrams and numbers 
in the dust by the fire. 

The heavily boned acromegalic 
stood sadly alone, listening to the 
last generals on Earth plot out the 
survival of their own people at the 
expense of others. Survival! Was that 
the basic rule of life? He looked at his 
huge hands. Could he kill again? 
While he debated with himself he 
realized how much worse was the al- 
ternative — suicide by inaction. 

The night wore on. Arrows were 
sharpened as warriors-become-raiders 



70 



GALAXY 



made ready. Suddenly the two Tooth- 
picks and Ball set up a keening that 
bleached out everyone’s adrenals. Eyes 
were wide open before the cerebral 
alpha waves had disappeared. Sleepy 
men and women clutched their weap- 
ons and wrapped their scanty belong- 
ings into bundles. But there was no 
place to flee. The horizon was dotted 
with dancing headlights of Hunter 
craft in all directions. The hovercraft 
circled and weaved but kept their 
distance at about three miles away. 

"Probably waiting for dawn and 
better hunting,” Moon said when the 
pandemonium had settled. 

Moses and Hugh went into a huddle 
with the Hip. 

“This may not be too bad after all,” 
said the Hip. “We may lose some men 
but our Agromechs will give us mo- 
bility and cover. Our men don't have 
to be drugged to fight Outside. They 
should be fairly efficient, even if they 
are a little weak from hunger. Might 
even pick up a few hovercraft if we 
win this engage — ” 

As if on some cue two Agromechs 
exploded. Then a third. 

“Self-destruct signal- -tight beam,” 
shouted Toothpick. “Move wide of the 
Agromechs. They’re all going to blow.” 

A few hours later a ring of smoking 
machines marked what had been the 
buckeyes first line of defense. Moses 
backed his people toward the nearest 
shaft city. 

“Fall back to the shaft caps. Bow- 
men, take up your positions behind 
the grills,” he ordered. 

Response was sluggish at best. In 
the dark and confusion conrrades were 
lost. Units were broken up. The ex- 
plosions and fires added panic to the 
army’s hunger and despair. Bellies had 
been empty for too long — and now 

HALF PAST HUMAN 



their owners faced an overpowering 
enemy. 

The acromegalic raised a heavy 
stone and pounded the shaft door, 
denting and chipping it. 

“Entrance unauthorized,” said the 
door. 

Suddenly he was thrown to the 
ground in a shower of sparks. Strug- 
gling awkwardly with his bulky joints 
he tried to stand up. A bowman picked 
up a stone and struck the door. Sparks 
flew. The bowman fell. The crowd 
edged back. In the subsequent silence 
they heard the ominous buzz of a 
force field leaking energy into the 
atmosphere. 

“Field’s on,” warned Moses’ Tooth- 
pick. “The Big ES has isolated us 
Outside.” 

The other shaft caps began to spark 
and buz. Moses watched helplessly as 
his army crumbled into aimless flight, 
marked by the random shrieks and 
moans of the weak being crushed by 
the strong. 

“Rally to me. Rally to me,” the Hip 
shouted as he marched off. Ball glow- 
ing. 

A clot of followers formed behind 
him. Guided by the pale beacon of 
the Ball, the clot grew -a widening 
belt of calm in a turbulent sea of strug- 
gling bodies. 

Moon picked up Dan to avoid the 
crush of the crowd flowing toward 
the Hip. 

“There goes the Ass from Tabulum 
again— having one of his mystic fits.” 

Moses smiled. 

“What does it matter? Anything is 
better than the disordered mess we 
had a moment ago. Listen, they’re 
even starting to sing.” 

The wind changed, carrying back 
the words of a song out of antiquity. 

71 



Few knew the lyrics — the words came 
scattered. 

We will gather at the river. The 
beautiful . .beautiful . river. We 
will gather at the river . 

Moon stumbled over a tangled mass 
of shafts and cord. He groped on the 
ground and came up with bows and 
arrows, a spear. 

He groaned. 

“Those fools. They’ve dropped their 
weapons. In a few hours we’re all going 
to be carved up by trophy knives — 
and all they can do is sing.’’ 

Moses glanced at his Toothpick. 
The cyber spoke. 

“There is an old river bed just 
south of the fifty-oh-oh line. Hip is 
leading his followers there. He is 
chanting about a Great Coming To- 
gether.’’ 

Moon asked acidly, “And the Hunt- 
ers? What is going to save us from the 
Hunters? 

Both Toothpicks answered with 
one voice, “Love will save us.” 

“Love will save us?” muttered Mo- 
ses. 

The concept was so alien to him 
that he eould get no hold of it. He 
felt utterly lost. 

The Hunters began to stir. Jos- 
ephson had been monitoring the sen- 
sor readings from the buekeye camp. 
He collated through the main com- 
puter and smirked. 

“The ehanting — prayers and hymns 
— a superstitious bunch, those buek- 
eyes. Relying on a five-thousand-year- 
old legend for protection. Desperate, 

I guess.” 

T he Hip stood in the riverbed of 
the once mighty Mississippi and 

72 



watched his followers file down the 
slopes. 

He rai.sed his glowing Ball toward 
the stars and ehanted, “Olga is love.” 

A narrow pencil of light shot up to- 
ward the heavens and a ball of fire ap- 
peared. At first it was a pinpoint but 
it grew and rapidly approached the 
ground. 

A miracle. 

Moon and Moses pointed their 
Toothpicks upward — three pencils of 
light reached toward the ball of fire. 

J OSEPHSON rocked back in his 
seat. Hundreds of flaming objects 
appeared in the skies. They darted to 
earth, rested a moment and streaked 
back into the night sky. A voice — 
metallic and feminine — broke into 
the Hunter’s communieation net. 

By the fiery wheels of Ezekiel and 
the flaming chariot of Elias will the 
Children of Olga be delivered from the 
Hunter's arrows to dwell in their right- 
ful place among the stars . 

Josephson waited for the sun to 
climb well up into the morning sky 
before he led his Hunters over the 
boulders that marked the 50:00 par- 
allel. But there was no hurry. He 
knew what he would find. Only the 
shaft caps, a few burning agromechs 
— and their Moleeular Reward. 

W HEN the last shuttlecraft was 
safely docked in her belly Star- 
ship Olga left Earth orbit and headed 
out. Processions of people moved 
through her vascular tubeways, still 
chanting, some wordlessly, others 
seeking words. 

Simple Willie pressed his forehead 
against the humming bulkhead. His 
ehest pain had lessened but the 
thought of all those stars out there in 

GALAXY 



the emptiness of space still made him 
nervous. He turned to Moses, who had 
found him. 

“Olga told me that my trophy was 
from a male — one of the Hunters. She 
says she will be able to unlock my 
memories so I’ll be able to remember — 
the most beautiful thing in the world.” 

Moses smiled. 

“If Olga says she can do it — she 
can. Now get some sleep. You want 
your cortex rested when she starts 
probing tomorrow.” 

Moses stretched out on his own 
bunk and shut his eyes, smiling. 
Toothpick had finally briefed him 
fully. Olga had returned. The mighty 
starship had dropped her colonists off 
at some distant star and returned to 
Earth for another shipload of her 
five-toed humans. 

“So you were a probe from space. 
Toothpick,” Moses said without open- 
ing his eyes. 

From his bracket over the bunk the 
cybernetic javelin answered, “Even 
a class six knows only what he is pro- 
gramed to know. Judging from the 
size of the Hip’s following and our suc- 
cess at Dundas Harbor — I’d guess 
Olga’s harvest of five-toeds was very 
successful.” 

“And there was only minimal dis- 
turbance among the planet’s superior 
life form — the Nebish.” 

“That may not have been a factor. 
Remember the casual way I killed 
four-toeds? I was obviously pro- 
gramed to consider only the five-toeds 
as human. To me the four-toeds were 
just a competitive life form — and a 
lower one at that.” 

Moses opened his eyes. 

“I guess we are the higher form. 
Olga confirmed that by selecting the 
humans with five toes for her new 
HALF PAST HUMAN 



colony. I consider us part of the 
cream of the human race — skimmed 
off Earth. The Nebish is just unsuit- 
able — inferior.” 

Olga spoke, her voice coming from 
the walls near Moses’ bunk. It had 
a Nordic quality. 

“Don’t be too smug,” she said. 
“You were selected because you show 
a higher individual survival potential. 
You still carry the gene for the fifth 
toe and the initiative that goes with 
it. The individual human is a very 
competitive — ideal for an Implant 
colony where he must adapt and 
evolve. Evolution on the individual 
level is measured in mere hundreds 
of years — social and industrial. 

“The hive is much more stable — 
evolving in terms of millions of years, 
and then toward death. It lives by the 
status quo. A hive will only become 
competitive when it is faced with an- 
other hive. Then it will do what it 
has to do to survive. It can come into 
being wherever your species is too 
successful — a product of population 
density.” 

Moses glanced at Willie, then at 
the wall. 

“We’re all seed of the hive?” 

“Seeds — yes,” Olga said with a 
note of sadness. 

Moses caught her shift into melan- 
cholia. 

He said, “You kept your existence 
a secret from Earth Society while you 
were harvesting the five-toeds. Do 
you fear the Big ES?” 

The mighty starship continued her 
navigation, propulsion and life-sup- 
port functions while a small part of 
her neurocircuitry concentrated on 
Moses’ question. 

“The Big ES — Earth Society is my 
enemy only in the sense that I am an 

73 



Implant starship. It would have 
stopped me if it could. But you must 
realize that it would have done so for 
her own citizens — to adjust their stan- 
dard of living up a fraction with 
whatever they could salvage from my 
hull. It would mean my death as a 
starship — but a better life for the av- 
erage Nebish.” 

“The hive is your enemy — yet you 
carry us, who are seeds of a new 
hive?” 

“1 carry you because you have five 
toes. I love you. 1 want to set up 
colonies — spread mankind among the 
stars. It is my whole purpose, my rea- 
son for existing. I was made by and 
belong to your kind. The Nebish has 
evolved into a hive creature human, 
perhaps -but I owe him nothing. My 
existence is not compatible with the 
hive -so I cannot love the Nebish.” 

Moses thought silently for a long 
time. A mechanical intelligence faced 
with an evolving creator — to whom 
did she owe homage? Would her 
function ever end? 

He remembered the night sky and 
another question came into his mind. 

Would man ever run out of stars? 

D uring the first stages of the 
voyage the fugitives from the 
Dundas Harbor Suspension Clinic 
were screened for skills. Those who 
had had some Healer experience were 
put to work by Olga in screening 
other colonists. Genetic material — 
lymphocytes from peripheral blood — 
was sampled. This was embryonated 
and genetic carbon copies were 
started. Each colonist found himself 
with a child, a sort of asexual bud. 

After what seemed like a brief period 



in suspension Olga’s charges awoke 
to find her in orbit around the new 
planet. Orbit-to-Surface-Modules 
were being loaded -single-seaters for 
the outpost sites and larger cabin 
classes for the settlements. 

“This planet will be your new 
home,” said Olga. “It was stocked 
with Earth biota 392.7 standard years 
ago. My probes indicate a successful 
take for most of the Earth species but 
local alien forms still predominate. 
You will have to use some Judgment, 
of course — but the probability of a 
successful Implant is very high,” 

Moses stood by, watching the load- 
ing. He waved at Simple Willie who 
was going down with one of the settle- 
ment groups. Willie had had most of 
his mental blocks removed by the 
Healers — enough to remember his 
coweye sweetheart. He had adjusted 
well and would probably do all right 
on the new planet. Several un- 
attached coweyes were in his settle- 
ment and Moses felt that Simple Wil- 
lie's gentle nature would win him a 
mate easily during the next follicular 
phase. Willie could use a mate — as 
could all the males. Each already car- 
ried a one- or two-month-old carbon 
copy child in his arms. 

Moses looked down at his own Lit- 
tle Moses, who cried and kicked. 
Moon walked up carrying Little 
Moon under his arm like a sack of 
grain. Little Moon was silent and 
watched the activity from wide dark 
eyes. 

Moses patted his own noisy infant. 

“I don’t know why he is crying. 
He’s fed and dry.” 

Moon frowned and casually picked 
up Little Moses with his left hand. In 
a moment the crying infant quieted. 



74 



GALAXY 



Moon scolded, “Relax. You have 
to handle offspring confidently. Par- 
ental anxiety means danger to chil- 
dren — any species. If you’re nervous 
your kid’s going to be pretty in- 
secure.” He added with a wry smile — 
“If there was one thing you should 
have learned Outside it was self-con- 
fidence.” 

The bald old man — fossil with 
child — handed Little Moses back to 
his bud-parent and walked over to 
his O.S.M. — a single-seater. He 
buckled Little Moon into his cradle. 
Dan ran up. 

“Get in,” ordered Moon. 

The dog turned. A little puppy had 
been following him all day. Dan 
didn’t know quite what to make of it. 
He bared his gold teeth. The puppy’s 
tail wagged twice. Two-hundred-year- 
old memory molecules registered and 
Dan gave Little Dan such a lick that 
the little guy tipped over. 

Moon growled impatiently and 
pushed the two dogs in as he closed 
the hatch. 

T he O.S.M. landed softly in a 
green mountain glade. An alien 
hawk with bright plumage circled in- 
quisitively. Earth goats nibbled the 
vegetation and stood unafraid when 
Moon called. 



“By Olga, a Garden of Eden,” he 
breathed. Eyeing a heavy udder and 
remembering little Moon’s needs, he 
picked up a cup and stalked the nan- 
ny. The goat stood calmly while he 
filled the cup. Moon poured the 
warm milk into a bottle and gave it 
to Little Moon. 

“How do you explain that?” he 
muttered as he surveyed the idyllic 
paradise. 

The goats came to him as he spoke. 

Unexpectedly a voice called out to 
him from a stand of trees. Moon 
glanced back at the O.S.M. Little 
Moon was still sucking safely. 

Old Moon approached the trees 
cautiously. 

“I thought this was supposed to be 
a one-man outpost — ” 

He saw a familiar object — a cyber- 
netic Javelin embedded in the soft hu- 
mus and draped with vines. One of 
Olga’s probes had probably been sit- 
ting here for centuries talking to the 
goats, preparing the way. 

“I am a companion robot. De- 
signed to be carried. Pick me up,” 
said the cyber. 

“I know,” said Moon as he pulled 
it free. “What have you been doing 
all these years?” 

“Making friends for you. Imprint-

ing the voice of man. Welcome to 
planet Tiercel land of the hawks.” 

“ I liatiks for the welcome and the 
friends you’ve been making.” Moon 
watched the frisky goats jumping high 
into the air. gamholing with the two 
l arth dogs. He said, "Man can al- 
ways use a few more friends as long 
as they are a liifferent species.” 

T HH acromegalic lumbered up to 
the checkout point. 

“Skills?” asked the turnstile. 
"Healer. But I've been retired ever 
since 

He held up his large clumsy hands. 
Olga's soothing voice came: “Your 
pituitary tumor was destroyed in the 
heating incident at Dundas Harbor. 
What you can do today, you will be 
able to do for years. Your condition 
will not progress. A Healer you are! 
I would like to assign you to this next 
settlement with the Tinker from 
Mount Tabulum. Is that satisfacto- 
ry?” 

The acromegalic glanced over the 
group loading. They numbered close 
to two hundred — mixed ages — Dun- 
das and 1 people. The Tinker stood 
by one of the cabin doors, nodding 
and smiling. Under his arm he car- 
ried a case of Olga’s precision surgi- 
cal instruments. 

The acromegalic joined Tinker’s 
settlement. 

Moses remained out of the main 
waiting area. There were still many 
thousands to Implant down. He was 
indecisive. Should he live alone and 
free — or should he put his efforts be- 
hind the struggling settlements and 
promote civilization? Perhaps hasten 
the emergence of the Big ES? He re- 
coiled at the idea — yet the sight of a 



succulent young coweye lured him. 
Her licorice hair, mint-green eyes and 
the small mole high on her left cheek 
attracted him. He could not ignore 
his sexual imprinting on the cinna- 
mon areola and the golden corpus 
luteum. 

He turned to Olga. 

“If we are all the seeds of the Big 
ES, aren’t we just hastening man’s 
end by promoting civilization. 
Shouldn’t we all choose single- 
seaters?” 

“Civilization is good -only the 
hive is bad.” 

“But how can I tell where the good 
aspects of civilization end and the 
evils of the hive begin?” 

“As a species you have perhaps as 
long as a thousand generations on 
this planet before the Big ES becomes 
a possibility. And even then your kind 
— or the equivalent of what you are 
today will be needed.” 

Moses relaxed. 

“A thousand generations? Then a 
little civilization isn’t too bad right 
now?” 

“A little civilization may be neces- 
sary for survival — right now.” 

Moses laughed and picked up 
Little Moses. He walked to the group 
being loaded and stood next to the 
coweye with licorice hair, wondering 
when her follicular phase was due. 

Olga continued the Implanting 
procedure with love in her circuits. 
Her humans were a fine species as 
long as they had something besides 
themselves to compete with and space 
was no problem. The planet Tiercel 
would keep the strain of Moses and 
Moon noble for many generations. 
Its ecology was a little more hostile 
than mother Earth’s. ★

JOHN CHAMBERS 



C ADE stood beside his dark 
and silent house, his limbs 
bright with contentment in the 
yellow mists before dawn. His 
usual jog through the river before 
his family awoke had been unex- 
pectedly rewarding. A school of 
verin recognized too late his pres- 
ence among them and now six lay 
in the grass beside the house, still 
oozing blood from the neat double 
rows of punctures on the backs of 



their necks. Another good catch. 

Once more Cade rinsed his 
mouth at the fountain. He was re- 
luctant to admit his squeamish- 
ness but he preferred his food 
cooked. Cade who shared his bed 
had no such preference and with 
Cade and Cade of the small beds 
would fall, ravenous and 
delighted, upon the verin where 
they lay. 

Just as green began to tinge the 



77 



yellow mists — the ship was there. 
A black ovoid standing a little 
taller than Cade and four times 
that broad, it hung motionless 
three leaps away, just above the 
grass. Its side was marked by 
two stubby white lines, vertical 
and horizontal, each bisecting the 
other. Music began to fill the air, 
a blend of the familiar and the in- 
credibly strange — but altogether 
pleasant. 

Cade told the Cades inside the 
house to remain asleep. A small 
port opened halfway along the up- 
per curve of the ship and one by 
one three golden balls were 
ejected to dance together on a jet 
of air. As the morning light in- 
creased, Cade could see no blem- 
ish in the smooth blackness of the 
hull, yet somehow it looked as an- 
cient as the headwaters of time. 
He stood calmly and watched, de- 
spite a primitive prickle of fear 
that wanted him to rasp his back- 
plates together in a shriek of de- 
fiance. 

Suddenly the quadrant of the 
ovoid nearest Cade became trans- 
parent from pole to pole. Within 
were massive gleaming boxes con- 
nected here and there by large 
tails and tentacles, to transmit 
Cade knew not what between 
them. There was an eeriness in 
their spacing, as though the crea- 
tures who moved among them 
were horribly misshapen, all height 
and no length, if such a thing 
could be imagined. 



The ovoid revolved and the next 
quadrant flashed clear to show 
closely packed containers that 
doubtless held stores. A large 
open volume, invested with 
strangely configured platforms 
and fitments,' apparently consti- 
tuted living quarters for a thing or 
things Cade wished very much 
not to see. 

T he next quadrant resembled 
the first, except that the boxes 
were covered with small windows 
that revealed various markings 
beneath moving indicators like 
large flat needles. In an arc 
around the perimeter were 
shorter boxes with sloping tops, 
with more of the small windows 
and many projections that one 
could easily imagine being manip- 
ulated by hands. Facing the cen- 
ter of the arc was a semi-enclosed 
platform to support that which 
moved the projections with what- 
ever it used for hands. Cade 
wanted badly to rinse his mouth 
again. The shape of the platform 
and the constricted space between 
it and the slope-top boxes con- 
firmed the brutal image of some- 
one with more than three-fourths 
of his body shorn away. 

As the fourth quadrant with its 
certain cargo of horror swung to- 
ward him. Cade barely suppressed 
the need to terminate existence. 
This time the blackness of the hull 
dissolved slowly, rippling through 
dark gray into a clearing trans-

lucence that showed a vertical 
wall dividing the quadrant into 
two compartments of unequal 
size. Within the smaller, inexor- 
ably growing more distinct, was 
the vertical, withered body of the 
thing. Both compartments were 
lined with the familiar windowed 
boxes. 

Cade struggled to overcome his 
revulsion, grateful that the music 
at this point seemed to be helping 
him to succeed. The creature’s 
skin, gruesomely wrinkled and 
folded, was silver and pink and 
blue. Under a head about the size 
of Cade’s the neck diminished to 
a mere stem, most fragile in ap- 
pearance. The face of this vertical 
monster was of course vertical, 
with two small wet eyes above an 
arrangement of three holes of un- 
known purpose. Two more holes, 
one on each side of the head, were 
cupped by shells of flesh that sug- 
gested hearing organs, therefore 
the other three openings presum- 
ably related in some weird com- 
bination to breathing, eating, and 
speaking — possibly one for each 
function. 

The thing held up two hands 
that were strangely split and tat- 
tered. Cade recognized the ges- 
ture and raised two of his hands, 
disappointed that the alien, which 
must have at least some intelli- 
gence, should as its first act of di- 
rect communication issue a chal- 
lenge to a fight that it couldn’t 
possibly win. He set his feet and 



rasped his backplates until the air 
howled with fury. 

Wobbling its head violently on 
its stringy neck, the thing crossed 
its hands over its body in sub- 
mission. Cade wondered at its 
quick surrender, then told himself 
roughly to be more objective. 
The thing surely had not sought 
him out merely to fight. Then 
what had it meant by the hands- 
ready sign? 

His thoughts raced. 

These creatures don’t fight as 
men fight, but with something in 
their hands. It had made an emp- 
ty-hands sign of peace, not the 
hands-ready invitation to grapple. 
Cade searched the mind and it 
was as he expected, unknown to 
Cade. But it was logical, given the 
fundamental aberrant behavior 
he had postulated. 

Cade crossed his own hands, 
then held them up again. The 
thing wobbled its head and raised 
its hands, its largest face-hole re- 
vealing itself to be a mouth as it 
writhed away from blunted but 
shining teeth. Cade’s backplates 
chattered briefly and he refused 
to speculate even in passing on 
why this being used yet another 
expression of hostility to show 
agreement or pleasure or what- 
ever it intended to convey this 
time. 

The creature turned to one of 
its boxes and moved a small pro- 
jection with a sliver of maimed 
hand. The divided-hand configu- 



ETERNITY CALLING 



79 



ration appeared to be efficient for 
these actions. Operating such 
closely crowded projections would 
be clumsy for the solid prehensile 
slab of a normal hand. Cade won- 
dered whether the modifications 
were made by special healers like 
those among the Cades — or by 
the individual. 

Moving with skillful jerks of its 
two rather rigid legs, the thing 
perched on a platform near the 
partition — which Cade saw was 
transparent — between the two 
compartments. It stabbed a round 
red projection with a hand sliver 
and the outer wall of the larger 
compartment folded down over 
the grass to make a ramp. From 
its platform the thing motioned 
Cade to a similar platform in the 
open compartment. 

C ADE flowed smoothly up the 
ramp, following a path worn 
smooth and bright across the 
matt’e surface of the metal, if 
metal it was. He leaned his left 
arms comfortably on the platform 
and looked through the partition. 
The thing inserted a hand into a 
small slotted box beside its plat- 
form and indicated a similar box 
beside Cade. 

The box was only a little larger 
than Cade’s hand, but he could 
not touch the sides. He expanded 
his hand until it was as long as his 
arm and still he encountered only 
a tingling void. Slowly he became 
aware of internal laughter not his. 



“You don’t have to climb in- 
side,” said a voice inside his head. 
The alien’s words were being 
transmitted and translated 
through the slotted boxes. 

“Right,” said Cade. 

“You’re not afraid?” 

“What would be the point?” 
said Cade. “Couldn’t you have 
held me and brought me in by 
force?” 

“By several methods,” said the 
thing. 

“I thought so,” said Cade. “It 
wouldn’t make much sense to give 
your victim an escape option, 
would it?” 

“Not victim. You won’t be 
harmed.” 

“Good.” said Cade.” I was be- 
ginning to feel like one of those 
verin out there.” 

The thing looked. 

“You did that?” 

“Sure.” 

“Are you a — ” The thing wob- 
bled its head. “No time. So little 
time even for the important 
things.” 

“Right,” said Cade. “But 
listen, do you fight with things in 
your hands?” 

“Things? Yes. A long time ago 
we did. Why?” 

Cade explained. Then, “I 
searched the mind, and we had 
never heard of it — but I knew it 
must be so.” 

“You searched the mind? What 
mind?” The thing’s words came 
fast. 



80 



GALAXY 



“Cade’s mind.”' 

“Who’s Cade?” 

“I am.” He pointed to his 
house, around the horizon. “We 
all are.” 

The creature’s words formed 
slowly, as though to avoid tum- 
bling over each other. 

“You have a group conscious- 
ness, a common mind.” 

“Partly. But part of each mind 
is separate. That’s the part talking 
to you now.” 

With its free hand the alien 
touseled a thatch of brown grassy 
fibers on top of its head and Cade 
realized its silver and blue parts 
were not skin but coverings of 
fabric like wall or floor cloths. It 
wobbled its head. “After all these 
years. And on a reptilian, chlorine 
world.” 

“I know what chlorine is. The 
other doesn’t sound too compli- 
mentary,” said Cade. 

“A zoological classification on 
Earth. My world. You resemble 
them.” 

“Unintelligent, no doubt. ‘After 
all these years’ of what? To me a 
year is a cycle around both suns. I 



suppose yours isn’t the same 
length — but no matter.” 

“One sun, in our case. 1 left my 
world more than twenty years ago 
by the ship’s clock, to follow the 
cross. I travel at many times the 
speed of light. Do you under- 
stand what’s happened on my 
world?” 



C ADE thought for a moment. 

“Depending on how many 
ship’s years you’ve spent in mo- 
tion, many thousand years may 
have passed on your world since 
you left.”. He looked at his house, 
at the distant line of trees that 
marked his river. “What’s the 
cross?” 

“The white marking on the 
ship. This.” The alien lifted and 
let fall a silver cross hanging from 
a chain that circled its neck. 
“The symbol of our cause.” 

“Does it have a meaning? Oth- 
er than the symbol of your — ah — 
cause?” 

“I think not. I’d probably have 
heard if it did. Now. I’m taking 
far too long here — but yours is the

first communal mind I’ve found 
and I’d like you to store the facts 
of our cause. Will you? For future 
generations?” 

“Maybe,” said Cade. “How 
many alien races have you 
found?” 

“Two hundred and seventy 
three. You’re two seventy-four. 
Please stop interrupting. I really 
must rush. Do you know about 
life after death? Eternal life?” 

“Life after — isn’t that a contra- 
diction?” 

“Oh, no. Not at all. Not. physi- 
cal life — but life of the soul.” 

“Soul. Like Cade’s common 
mind?” 

“I’m not sure. If you have a 
soul it’s probably in the part 
that’s not common with the rest of 
Cade.” 

“Oh.” 

“Let’s get on. You can imagine 
from this ship, this translator, 
how capable my world is, technol- 
ogy wise. How rich. I think you 
can visualize that pretty well.” 

“Yes.” 

“Well, for many years on my 
world souls — their existence, if 
you will — had to be taken on 
faith.” 

“Faith.” 

“Yes. Like there’s no evidence 
but you’re sure of it anyway sort 
of thing.” 

“I’m sure of it?” asked Cade. 

“Well, if you couldn’t know for 
sure but you were certain of it. 



that would be a faith sort of thing. 
Now wait a minute. Just let me 
get to the point, if you please. The 
point is, nobody has to fool 
around with faith any more. I 
think you’ll agree that’s all to the 
good.” 

“Right.” We’ve scientifically 
identified the elements of the soul. 
That machine right there beside 
you, the blue one, can tell me in 
five seconds whether you have a 
soul.” 

“Why do you want to know?” 

“For one thing, so I’ll know 
whether it’s been redeemed. If the 
white light comes on and stays on, 
you’ve got a soul that’s been re- 
deemed. If it flashes, your soul 
needs redeeming. Red light, no 
soul at all.” 

“What’s that — redeemed?” 

“Well, it’s — look at it this way 
— listen, you scaly — . My friend, 
it’s all on a scientific basis. Just 
accept it, will you please?” The 
alien’s face had been turning 
pinker as he spoke, although his 
tones had little apparent connec- 
tion with the bright hues of tran- 
quillity. “If the blue machine says 
you have a soul that needs re- 
deeming — the white machine 
alongside does the job and auto- 
matically cross-checks for accura- 
cy and completeness. All com- 
pletely scientific and unargu- 
able.” 

“But if I had a soul wouldn’t I 
know if it needed redeeming?” 



82 



GALAXY 



“Oh, no. Not at all. There 
eould have been some redeemer 
through here centuries ago — may- 
be even while they were still re- 
deeming manually.” 

“That was the old way?” 

“Of course. Just because we’ve 
put this on a scientific basis 
doesn’t mean it’s something new. 
There’s absolutely no conflict be- 
tween science and religion.” 
“Religion?” 

“This whole bag, redeeming 
and like that.” 

“Is saving in addition to re- 
deeming — or instead of?” 

“Oh, my word. In addition to, 
and after, as well. No need to fool 
around trying to save a soul that 
hasn’t been redeemed. Complete 
waste of time.” 

“I see.” 

“Now it would take an hour to 
cover the whole field of religious 
philosophy, and I don’t have an 
hour to spare, of course.” 

“Of course.” 

“But I want to fill you in a little 
more. The pink machine there 
tells me whether your soul is 
saved. If not, the gold machine 
saves it, twice, as a matter of faet, 
for double assurance, then cross- 
checks twice. Beautiful?” 
“Beautiful. And you spend 
your life doing this. How many 
more like you?” 

“Maybe hundreds. Maybe just 
me. I’ve been away a long time.” 
“What’s the point?”

TX/ELL, it’s a lonely universe. 

■■ We think that to inter- 
breed with new people with souls 
would be — well — new blood, you 
know. Sharing the joys of eternal 
life. Are you bisexual?” 

“Uh, no, not personally. But 
you must mean the race. It is.” 

“So is ours. And so am I.” 

“Congratulations. I guess. Is it 
very common with you crea- 
tures?” 

“All of us that follow the cross. 
By surgical intervention.” It 
turned red. “I can either plant 
seed in fertile soil or carry new 
seed back to earth. All in the 
name of the cause, of course.” 

“Of course. I guess we wouldn’t 
be — uh — compatible, even chemi- 
cally,” said Cade, feeling consid- 
erable relief. “Shall we get on 
with the test?” 

“Put your other — another hand 
in the blue machine’s slot,” said 
the thing. 

Cade did and the red light 
glowed. 

The thing breathed deeply. 

“Well, you can’t win all the 
time.” 

“No,” said Cade. “How many 
races have you found with souls?” 

The thing’s voice was weak. 

“None.” 

“Pity. It really must be lonely, 
the only beings in the universe 
with souls.” 

The alien’s head tumbled for- 



ward sickeningly on its weak 
neck. Then it looked at Cade and 
its voice was urgent inside his 
head. 

“We don’t have souls. And we 
must find them. Find souls and 
eternal life.” Its wet eyes became 
wetter and a clear fluid spilled 
down the hideous flat face. 

“Please store us in Cade’s mem- 
ory. We’ll make you rich beyond 
your wildest imagination if you 
help us find a race that can mix 
with us and bring us life everlast- 
ing. We’ll make the other world 
rich, too. Rich beyond belief.” 

It stabbed a green projection 
and a small black box tumbled 
past Cade, down the ramp to the 
grass. “That’s a perpetually pow- 
ered combination prayer wheel 
and relay beacon. To call us if 
you find a prospect. Graphic in- 
structions on the side. You will put 
us in your memory? Remember, 
rich beyond belief.” 

“Yes,” said Cade, lying for the 
first time in a long life that had 
been rich beyond belief. 

He withdrew his hand from the 
slotted box and moved down the 
ramp. The hull whispered shut 
and the ship was no longer there. 

Cade slid the beacon out of 
sight behind a bush and called his 
family. The verin were beginning 
to smell. He rinsed his mouth at 
the fountain.

THE YEAR OE THE 
GOOD SEED 

I T WAS the Year of the Good 
Seed. 

When Captain Planter came 
down out of the gleam-ridden 
night sky in his needle of power, 
red thread of fires hanging from 
its back, his aide and physicist 
were at his side. Machineries 
were at his hand, histories in his 
head and he came down into the 
Year of the Good Seed. 

It was a time of celebration, of 
rejoicing. It was a time for the 
sowing of peace, happiness and 
hope. 

it was a time of worship. 

Captain Planter stood upon a 
hillside beneath the sky of morn- 
ing and regarded the city. 



85 



Staring down across the frost- 
gripped grasses, mists waving 
above them, he looked upon the 
spires and blocks and domes of 
the city, dappled by the yellow 
sunrise, threaded with the darker 
curves and lines of shadowed 
streets. He saw, though, only a 
part of it from that high vantage, 
because it was one of the larger 
cities of the world. From above, 
however, coming down through 
the night, it had looked like a two- 
thousand-year birthday cake for 
civilization, which perhaps it was, 
with its candles all a-flicker. 

“They must have spotted us,” 
said Condem, his aide. “Be here 
soon.” 

“Yes,” said the captain. 

“Human, they’ll be,” said Con- 
dem, “if Anthro’s right.” 

“It would seem so,” said Plant- 
er, lowering his glasses. “Looks 
enough like an Earth city — ” 

“Could they be the eause of it, 
I wonder?” 

“Possibly,” said the captain. 

“Strange.” 

“Perhaps.” 

Beneath the sky of afternoon, 
the yellow sun high in the spring- 
ing of the year, they met with the 
people of the city and established 
communications. They met with 
the people of its government and 
with the people of the big govern- 
ment of which its government was 
a part. They met with the people 
of its religion, of which the big 
government was a part. They 



were all people-people — that is 
to say, of human appearance. 

There was an air of festivity 
about them as they moved 
through the senates and the tem- 
ples, the mansions and the mili- 
tary bases, the conferences and 
the broadcasting rooms, down the 
streets and up the stairs, through 
the laboratories, back to the tem- 
ples. 

This was because it was the 
Year of the Good Seed. 

T he captain and his aides had 
to answer many questions be- 
fore they could ask any of their 
own. 

Before they could answer all 
the many questions they were 
asked the dusk-fires began. 

This was upon the seventh day 
and Yanying, the physicist, looked 
into the sunset with eyes that al- 
ways squinted and said. “It has 
begun.” 

Planter moved to the window 
of the suite they had been given — 
within the temple, within the city. 

He stared upon an aurora bore- 
alis which pierced the eye and 
shattered the mind with its bril- 
liance, its colors. 

“My God.” he said. 

“The whole sky’s a cockeyed 
rainbow,” said Condem, moving 
to his side. 

“The explosions are closer than 
we thought,” said Yanying, “if 
the Allen Bottle can trap that 
much. It must be that they are 



86 



GALAXY 



originating from here — from the 
planet, not the sun.” 

“Well, why then? Testing? 
That doesn’t seem to be the an- 
swer, because the thing follows a 
definite cycle. This is right on 
time.” 

“Natural phenomena,” said the 
physicist, “are not the only hap- 
penings that follow definite cy- 
cles.” 

“A moratorium followed by a 
holocaust, followed by another 
moratorium, followed by — It 
doesn’t make sense.” 

“They might look like us,” 
said Condem, “but that doesn’t 
mean what’s inside’s the same. 
For a while we did speculate 
that this thing might be a local 
Armageddon. But there’s nothing 
wrong here. No signs of nuclear 
war, or the rebuilding that follows 
after. Nothing. There’s been 
nothing like that at all, from 
everything they’ve said, from 
everything we’ve seen.” 

“From all that’s been shown 
us,” corrected Planter. “I won- 
der — ” 

“What?” asked Yanying. 

“Is someone, something, dying 
somewhere?” 

“Something is always dying 
somewhere,” said Yanying. “The 
question is one of quantity and 
quality — and where.” 

“They might look like us — ” 
said Condem. 

A knock came upon their door. 

The captain opened it to admit 



Laren, high priest of the center 
temple of the city. 

Laren was several inches shorter 
and several pounds heavier than 
any of them. His thinning hair 
was brushed to cover over a 
spreading bald spot. Neatly tai- 
lored tweed robes covered the 
rest of him, shoulder to knee and 
a smile which might have betok- 
ened senility or orgasm opened his 
wide face. 

“Sirs,” he said, “it has begun. I 
came to ask whether you would 
join us in the worship of the Crea- 
tor of the universe. I see, how- 
ever, that you already have.” 

“Worship?” asked Planter. 

“Your friends look upon the 
first outward signs of the season 
within the heavens.” 

“The lights? The aurora? You’re 
doing that?” 

“Of course,” said Laren, “to 
worship Him as He is, with a sac- 
rifice of pure power upon the al- 
tar of the sky.” 

“Those are nuclear explosions 
you’re setting off — in outer space 
— aren’t they?” 

“Yes. For has He not always, 
does He not now and will He not 
forever so manifest Himself with- 
in the eternal cycle of the sun? Is 
He not the force that separates 
atom from atom, so that the power 
is freed to flow like rivers of 
benediction through the universe 
of His glory?” 

“I suppose so,” said Planter. “I 
never thought of it quite that way 



THE YEAR OF THE GOOD SEED 



87 



before. It is the reason we are 
here, however.” 

“To behold our way of wor- 
ship?” 

“Well, yes. Actually — now that 
I think of it — yes. Your sacrifices 
of pure power upon the altar of 
the sky have been detected be- 
yond your solar system. They 
come at such regular intervals — 
about half a generation apart — 
that at first it was guessed that 
something unique was happening 
to your sun. It is rather strange to 
discover they are — prayers.” 
“What else could they be?” 
asked Laren. 

“If not disturbances within 
your sun, then perhaps signs of 
war upon your planet.” 

“War? Yes, we have war. And 
the unrest which follows and pre- 
cedes war. More of this than ac- 
tual war. This is always with us. 
You see, there is another power, 
upon the other continent . But 
I do not see how the celebration 
of the Year of the Good Seed 
could be mistaken for such.” 

“Year of the Good Seed?” 
asked Yinyang. “What is that?” 

“ IT IS the year for the planting 
of new, good things — things 
that will take root and grow 
through the cycle of years that 
is to follow. By the Year of a 
Thousand Flowers this time’s 
promise will be fulfilled.” 

“I begin to understand,” said 
Yinyang, turning to the Captain. 



“It sounds similar to the cycle of 
years celebrated in many Asian 
countries. There is the Year of 
the Rat, the Year of the Ox, the 
Year of the Tiger, the Year of the 
Hare,” he said, “then those of 
the Dragon, the Serpent, the 
Horse, the Goat, the Monkey, 
the Rooster, the Dog and the Pig. 
The procession is based on the old 
astrology — and every astrological 
system is, ultimately, the repre- 
sentation of a solar myth. Theirs 
seems to be derived from an 
agricultural phase of their society 
— the effect of the sun upon 
growing things. The symbolism 
has been maintained by their 
religion and it would seem that 
they, too, celebrate the times by 
fireworks displays. They use the 
greatest explosive force at their 
command.” 

“It is just as you have said,” 
Laren agreed. 

“That’s all they use it for?” 
said Planter. 

“I would not be surprised if 
that were the case. After all, the 
Chinese discovered gunpowder 
and the only thing they used it 
for was firecrackers. It took a 
European mind to put it to such 
a useful end as blowing up one’s 
fellows.” 

“Excuse me — but I do not fol- 
low the conversation,” said Laren. 
“If this thing ‘gunpowder’ was 
like prayers and it was also used 
to destroy other men, does this 
mean . .? I do not understand!” 



88 



GALAXY 



“It is just as well,” said Yinyang. 

“It is probably true, though,” 
Laren continued, “that if we were 
to pray directly above a city of 
the enemy it would cease to exist. 
But this would be blasphemous. 
No one would do such a thing.” 

“Of course not,” said Planter. 

Laren turned toward the win- 
dow and stared at the prayer- 
streaked sky. 

Then, after a time: “Have 

such things ever been commit- 
ted?” 

“Perhaps,” said Planter. “Long 
ago and in some far place.” 

“The will of the Creator is that 
the Just triumph,” Laren said. 
“If the ones who may have done 
this thing were the righteous, 
such as ourselves, then it may 
not have been blasphemy but a 
furtherance of His will.” 



“The doings of ignorant men^ 
in other places need not concern 
you,” said Yinyang. 

“That is true,” he replied. 

“So let it be forgotten,” said 
Planter. 

“Yes, of course.” 

Together they watched the 
opening of the Year of the Good 
Seed. 

I T WAS not much later, while 
still moving at a -C velocity, 
that rivers of light flowed about 
Captain Planter’s vessel. When 
Condem informed him that the 
nature of the detonations was 
unique for the area in that the 
light appeared to have been fil- 
tered through an atmosphere on 
this occasion, the Captain duly 
entered the observation in his log.

THE YEAR OF THE GOOD SEED

ROBERT SILVERBERG 



need on his part to learn more 
about the intelligent species he 
once treated and abused as ani- 
mals. 

The nildoror understand and 
sympathize and one of them, Srin'- 
gahar, agrees to carry Gundersen 
to the nearest nildor encampment, 
where he can apply for a travel 
permit. 

At the encampment Gunderson 
meets Vol'himyor, an ancient, 
many-born nildor, requests per- 
mission to go to the nildoror place 
of rebirth, the mist country. He 
is invited to spend some time with 
his hosts before permission is 
granted — and that night finds 
himself joining them in an elemen- 
tal, ritualistic dance. 

He is shocked to discover that 
in so doing is able to share him- 
self completely with the nildoror. 
in effect becoming one of them. 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



EDMUND GUNDERSEN, 
former sector chief on Holman's 
World, an Earth colony, returns to 
the planet as little more than a 
tourist after Earth has returned it 
to the control of its indigenes, an 
intelligent, elephantine life form, 
the nildoror. The planet is now 
known by its native name of Bel- 
zagor. 

Other changes have taken 
place, some subtle, others not. 
Left over traces of Man’s occupa- 
tion of the planet — buildings, a ro- 
bot-crewed spaceport — are gradu- 
ally falling into disrepair. The nil- 
doror have resumed their lives 
and customs as if they had never 
been — sometimes savagely — inter- 
rupted by Man. Gunderson's re- 
turn has been dictated by an inner 



91 



VI 

H e awoke some time after 
midday. The only sign of last 
night’s frenzy was in the spongy 
turf near the lakeshore, which was 
terribly scuffed and torn. 

Gundersen felt stiff and numb. 
Also he was abashed. He knew the 
embarrassment of one who has 
thrown himself too eagerly into 
someone else’s special amusement. 
He could hardly believe that he 
had done what he knew himself to 
have done. In his shame he felt an 
immediate impulse to leave the 
encampment at once, before the 
nildoror could show him their con- 
tempt for an Earthman capable of 
making himself a thrall to their 
festivity. But he shackled the 
thought, remembering that he had 
a purpose in coming here. 

He limped down to the lake and 
waded out until its water came up 
to his breast. He soaked a while 
and washed away the sweat of the 
night before. Then fastidiously, he 
went to a different part of the lake 
and drank deeply. Emerging, he 
found his clothing and put it on. 

A nildor came to him and said, 
“Vol’himyor will speak to you 
now.” 

The many-born one was half- 
way up the slope. Gundersen 
could not find the words of any of 
the greetings formulae. He simply 
stared raggedly at the old nildor. 

Vol’himyor said, “You dance 
well, my once-born friend. You 
dance with joy. You dance with 
love. You dance like a nildor, do 
you know that?” 

“It is not easy for me to under- 
92 



stand what happened to me last 
night,” said Gundersen. 

“You proved to us that our 
world has captured your spirit.” 
“Was it offensive to you that an 
Earthman danced among you?” 

“If it had been offensive,” said 
Vol’himyor slowly, “you would 
not have danced among us.” 
There was a long silence. Then the 
nildor said, “We will make a trea- 
ty, we two. I will give you permis- 
sion to go into the mist country. 
Stay there until you are ready to 
come out. But when you return 
bring with you the Earthman 
known as Cullen and offer him to 
the northernmost encampment of 
nildoror, the first of my people 
that you find. Is this agreed?” 
“Cullen?” Gunderson asked. 
Across his mind flared the image 
of a short broad-faced’ man with 
fine golden hair and mild green 
eyes. “Cedric Cullen, who was 
here when 1 was here?” 

“The same man.” 

“He worked with me when I 
was at the station in the Sea ol 
Dust.” 

“He lives now in the mist coun- 
try,” Vol’himyor said, “having 
gone there without permission. We 
want him.” 

“What has he done?” 

“He is guilty of a grave crime. 
Now he has taken sanctuary 
among the sulidoror, where we are 
unable to gain access to him. It 
would be a violation of our coven- 
ant with them if we removed this 
man ourselves. But we may ask 
you to do it.” 

“You won’t tell me the nature 
of his crime?” 



GALAXY 



“Does it matter? We want him. 
Our reasons are not trifling ones. 
We request you to bring him to 
us.” 

“You’re asking one Earthman 
to seize another and turn him in 
for punishment,” said Gundersen. 
“How am I to know where justice 
lies in this affair?” 

“Under the treaty of relinquish- 
ment — are we not the arbiters of 
justice on this world?” 

Gundersen admitted that this 
was so. 

“Then we hold the right to deal 
with Cullen as he deserves,” Vol’- 
himyor said. 

That did not, of eourse, make it 
proper for Gundersen to aet as 
eatspaw in handing his old com- 
rade over to the nildoror. But 
Vol’himyor’s implied threat was 
clear — do as we wish, or we grant 
you no favors. 

Gundersen said, “What punish- 
ment will Cullen get if he falls in- 
to your custody?” 

“Punishment? Punishment? 
Who speaks of punishment?” 

“If the roan’s a criminal — ” 

“We wish to purify him,” said 
the many-born one. “We desire to 
cleanse his spirit. We do not re- 
gard the process as punishment.” 
“Will you injure him physically 
in any way?” 

“It is not to be thought.” 

“Will you end his life?” 

“Can you mean such a thing? 
Of course not.” 

“Will you imprison him?” 

“We will keep him in custody,” 
Vol’himyor, “for however long the 
rite of purification takes. I do not 
think it will be Itwig. He will swift- 



ly be freed and he will be grateful 
to us.” 

Gundersen considered all as- 
pects of the matter. Shortly he 
said, “I agree to our treaty, many- 
born one, but only if I may add 
several clauses before coneluding.” 

“Go on.” 

“If Cullen will not tell me the 
nature of his erime I am released 
from my obligation to hand him 
over.” 

“Agreed.” 

I am also released from my 
obligation if the sulidoror object to 
my taking Cullen out of the mist 
eountry.” 

“They will not object. But 
agreed.” 

“If Cullen must be subdued by 
violence in order to bring him 
forth — 1 am released.” 

The nildor hesitated a moment. 

“Agreed,” he said finally. 

“I have no other conditions to 
add.” 

“Then our treaty is made,” 
Vol’himyor said. “You may begin 
your northward journey today. 
Five of our once-born ones must 
also travel to the mist country for 
their time of rebirth has come. 
They will accompany you and 
safeguard you along the way if you 
wish. Among them is Srin’gahar, 
whom you already know.” 

“Will it be troublesome for them 
to have me with them?” 

“Srin’gahar has particularly re- 
quested the privilege of serving as 
your guardian,” said Vol’himyor. 

A senior nildor summoned 
Srin’gabar and the four others 
who would be going toward re- 
birth. 



DOWNWARD TO THE EARTH 



93 



Gundersen was gratified at this 
confirmation of the existing data: 
once more the frenzied dance of 
the niidoror had preceded the de- 
parture of a group bound for re- 
birth. 

S RIN’GAHAR and Gundersen 
went aside to plan their route. 
“Where in the mist country do 
you intend to go?” the nildor 
asked. 

“It does not matter. I just want 
to enter it. I suppose I’ll have to 
go wherever Cullen is.” 

“Yes. But we do not know ex- 
actly where he is. We will have to 
wait until we are there to learn it. 
Do you have special places to visit 
on the way north?” 

“I want to stop at the Earth- 
man stations,” Gundersen said. 
“Particularly at Shangri-la Falls. 
So my idea is that we’ll follow 
Madden’s River northwestward 
and — ” 

“These names are unknown to 
me.” 

“Sorry. I guess they’ve all re- 
verted now to nildororu names 
and I don’t know those. But 
wait — ” Gundersen scratched a 
hasty but serviceable map of 
Belzagor’s western hemisphere in 
the mud. Across the waist of the 
disk he drew the thick swath of 
the tropics. At the right side he 
gouged out a curving bite to indi- 
cate the ocean. On the left he out- 
lined the Sea of Dust. Above and 
below the band of the tropics he 
drew thinner lines representing the 
northern and southern mist zones. 
Beyond them he indicated the gi- 

94 



gantic icecaps. He marked the 
spaceport and the hotel at the 
coast with an X and cut a wiggly 
line up from there, clear across the 
tropics into the northern mist 
country, to show Madden’s River. 
At the midway point of the river 
he placed a dot to mark Shangri- 
la Falls. “Now,” said Gundersen, 
“if you follow the tip of my 
stick — ” 

“What are those marks on the 
ground?” asked Srin’gahar. 

A map of your planet, Gunder- 
sen wanted to say. But there was 
no nildororu word in his mind for 
“image,” “picture” and similar 
concepts. 

He said lamely, “This is your 
world. This is Belzagor — or at 
least half of it. See, this is the 
ocean. The sun rises here and — ” 

“How can this be my world — 
these marks — when my world is so 
large?” 

“This is like your world. Each 
of these lines, here, stands for a 
place on your world. You see, 
here, the big river that runs out of 
the mist country and comes down 
to the coast, where the hotel is, 
yes? And this mark is the space- 
port. These two lines are the top 
and the bottom of the northern 
mist country. The — ” 

“It takes a strong sulidor a 
march of many days to cross the 
northern mist country,” said 
Srin’gahar. “I do not understand 
how you can point to such a small 
space and tell me it is the north- 
ern mist country. Forgive me, 
friend of my journey. I am very 
stupid.” 

Gundersen tried again, attempt- 
GALAXY 



ing to communicate the nature of 
the marks on the ground. But 
Srin’gahar simply could not com- 
prehend the idea of a map, nor 
could he see how scratched lines 
could represent places. The map 
was a metaphor of place, an ab- 
straction from reality. Evidently 
even beings possessing G’rakh 
might not have the capacity to 
grasp such abstractions. 

He apologized to Srin’gahar for 
his own inability to express con- 
cepts clearly and rubbed out the 
map with his boot. Without it, 
planning the route was somewhat 
more difficult but they found 
ways to communicate. Gundersen 
learned that the great river at 
whose mouth the hotel was situ- 
ated was called the Seran’nee in 
nildororu. The place where the 
river plunged out of the moun- 
tains into the coastal plain, which 
Earthmen knew as Shangri-la 
Fall, was Du’jayukh to nildoror. 
Then it was simple for them to 
agree to follow the Seran’nee to 
its source, with a stop at Du’jay- 
ukh and at any other settlement of 
Earthmen that happened to lie 
conveniently on the path north. 

While this was being decided, 
several of the sulidoror brought a 
late breakfast of fruit and lake 
fish to Gundersen, exactly as 
though they recognized his author- 
ity under the Company. It was a 
curiously anachronistic gesture, 
almost servile, not at all like the 
way they had tossed him a raw 
slab of malidar meat the day be- 
fore. Then they had been testing 
him, even taunting him. Now they 
were waiting upon him. 



T he journey began in late af- 
ternoon. Five nildoror moved 
in single file, Srin’gahar at the 
back of the group with Gundersen 
perched on his back; the Earth- 
man did not appear to be the 
slightest burden for him. Their 
path led due north along the rim 
of the great rift. The mountains 
that guarded the central plateau 
rose on the left. By the light of the 
sinking sun Gundersen stared 
toward that plateau. Down here in 
the valley his surroundings had a 
certain familiarity — he might al- 
most be in some steamy jungle of 
South America. But the plateau 
appeared truly alien. Gundersen 
eyed the thick tangles of spiky 
purplish moss that festooned and 
nearly choked the trees along the 
top of the rift wall. The way the 
parasitic growth drowned its hosts 
the trees seemed grisly to him. The 
wall itself, of some soapy gray- 
green rock, dotted with angry 
blotches of crimson lichen and 
punctuated every few hundred 
meters by long ropy strands of a 
swollen blue fungus, cried out its 
otherworldliness — the soft mineral 
had never felt the impact of rain- 
drops but had been gently carved 
and shaped by the humidity alone, 
taking on weird knobbinesses and 
hollows over the millennia. No- 
where on Earth could one see a 
rock wall like that, serpentine and 
involute and greasy. 

The forest beyond the wall 
looked impenetrable and vaguely 
sinister. The silence, the heavy 
and sluggish air, the sense of dark 
strangeness, the flexible limbs of 
the glossy trees bowed almost to 



DOWNWARDTOTHE EARTH 



95 



the ground by moss, the occasion- 
al distant snort of some giant 
beast, made the central plateau 
forbidding and hostile. Few Earth- 
men had ever entered it and it had 
never been surveyed in detail. 

Gundersen had been in the plat- 
eau country only once, by acci- 
dent, when his pilot had had to 
make a forced landing en route 
from coastal headquarters 'to the 
Sea of Dust. Seena had been with 
him. They spent a night and a day 
in that forest, Seena terrified from 
the moment of landing, Gunder- 
sen comforting her in a standard 
manly way but finding that her 
terror was somehow contagious. 
The girl trembled as one alien 
happening after another presented 
itself and shortly Gundersen was 
on the verge of trembling too. 

They watched, fascinated and 
repelled, while an army of innu- 
merable insects with iridescent 
hexagonal bodies and long hairy 
legs strode with maniacal persis- 
tence into a sprawling glade of 
tigermoss — for hours the savage 
mouths of the carnivorous plants 
bit the shining insects into pieces 
and devoured them and still the 
horde marched on to destruction. 
At last the moss was so glutted 
that it went into sporulation, puf- 
fing up cancerously and sending 
milky clouds of reproductive bod- 
ies spewing into the air. By morn- 
ing the whole field of moss lay de- 
flated and helpless. Tiny green 
reptiles with broad rasping tongues 
moved in to devour every strand, 
laying bare the soil for a new gen- 
eration of flora. And then there 
were the feathery, jellylike things. 



streaked with blue and red, that 
hung in billowing cascades from 
the tallest trees, trapping unwary 
flying creatures. And bulky 
rough-skinned beasts as big as 
rhinos, bearing mazes of blue ant- 
lers with interlocking tines, 
grubbed for roots a dozen meters 
from their camp, glaring sourly at 
the strangers from Earth. And 
long-necked browsers with eyes 
like beacons munched on high 
leaves, squirting barrelsful of pur- 
ple urine from openings at the 
bases of their throats. And dark 
otterlike beings ran chattering 
past the stranded Earthmen, steal- 
ing anything within quick grasp. 
Other animals visited them also. 
This planet, which had never 
known the hunter’s hand, abound- 
ed in big mammals. 

“Elave you ever been in 
there?” Gundersen asked Srin’- 
gahar, as night began to conceal 
the rift wall. 

“Never. My people seldom en- 
ter that land.” 

“Occasionally, flying low over 
the plateau, I used to see nildoror 
encampments in it. Not often, but 
sometimes. Do you mean that 
your people no longer go there?” 

“No,” said Srin’gahar. “A few 
of us have need to go to the plat- 
eau but most do not. Sometimes 
the soul grows stale and one must 
change one’s surroundings. If one 
is not ready for rebirth one goes to 
the plateau. It is easier to confront 
one’s own soul in there. Can you 
understand what I say?” 

“I think so,” Gundersen said. 
“It’s like a place of pilgrimage, 
then — a place of purification?” 



96 



GALAXY 



“In away.” 

“But why have the nildoror 
never settled permanently up 
there? There’s plenty of food. The 
climate is warm — ” 

“It is not a place where G’rakh 
rules,” the nildor replied. 

“Is it dangerous to nildoror? 
Wild animals, poisonous plants, 
anything like that?” 

“No, I would not say that. We 
have no fear of the plateau, and 
there is no place on this world that' 
is dangerous to us. But the pla- 
teau does not interest us, except 
those who have the special need of 
which I spoke. As I say, G’rakh is 
foreign to it. Why should we go 
there? There is room enough for 
us in the lowlands.” 

The plateau is too alien even for 
them, Gundersen thought. They 
prefer their nice little jungle. 

He was not sorry when darkness 
hid the plateau from view. 

T hey made camp that night 
beside a hissing-hot stream. 
Evidently its waters issued from 
one of the underground cauldrons 
common in this sector of the con- 
tinent. Srin’gahar said that the 
source lay not far to the north. 
Clouds of steam rose from the 
swift flow. The water, pink with 
high-temperature microorganisms, 
bubbled and boiled. 

He scrubbed his face, taking ex- 
traordinary pleasure in the art, 
and supplemented a dinner of 
food capsules and fresh fruit with 
a stew of greenberry roots — delect- 
able when boiled, poisonous other- 
wise. For shelter while sleeping 
Gundersen used a monomolecular 



jungle blanket that he had stowed 
in his backpack, his one meager 
article of luggage on this journey. 
He draped the blanket over a 
tripod of boughs to keep away 
nightflies and other noxious in- 
sects and crawled under it. The 
ground, thickly grassed, was a 
good enough mattress for him. 

Srin’gahar settled down pro- 
tectively a short distance from 
Gundersen and wished him a good 
sleep. 

Gundersen said, “Do you mind 
talking a while? I want to know 
something about the process of 
rebirth. How do you^ know, for in- 
stance, that your time is upon 
you? Is it something you feel with- 
in yourself, or is it just a matter 
of reaching a certain age? Do 
you — ” 

He became aware that Srin’ga- 
har was paying no attention. The 
nildor had fallen into what might 
have been a deep trance and lay 
perfectly still. 

Shrugging, Gundersen rolled 
over and waited for sleep. But 
sleep was a long time coming. 

He thought a good deal about 
the terms under which he had 
been permitted to make this 
northward journey. Perhaps an- 
other many-born one would have 
allowed him to go into the mist 
country without attaching the con- 
dition that he bring back Cedric 
Cullen. Or perhaps he would not 
have been granted safe-conduct at 
all. Gundersen suspected that the 
results would have been the same 
no matter which encampment of 
nildoror he had happened to go to 
for his travel permission. Though 



DOWNWARDTOTHE EARTH 



97 




the nildoror had no means of long- 
distance communication, no gov- 
ernmental structure in any Earth- 
ly sense, no more coherence as a 
race than a population of jungle 
beasts, they nevertheless were re- 
markably well able to keep in 
touch with one another and to 
strike common policies. 

What was it that Cullen had 
done, Gundersen wondered, to 
make him so eagerly sought? 

In the old days Cullen had 



seemed overwhelmingly normal-- 
a cheerful, amiable, ruddy man 
who collected insects, spoke no 
harsh words and held his liquor 
well. When Gundersen had been 
the chief agent out at Fire Point 
in the Sea of Dust, a dozen years 
before, Cullen had been his assist- 
ant. Months on end there were on- 
ly the two of them in the place and 
Gundersen had come to know the 
other man quite well, he imagined. 

Cullen had had no plans for 



98 



GALAXY 





making a career with the Com- 
pany. He had signed a six-year 
contract, would not renew. He had 
intended to take up a university 
appointment when he had done 
his time on Holman’s World. He 
had come here only for seasoning 
and for the prestige that accured 
to anyone who had a record of 
outworld service. But then the po- 
litical situation on Earth had 
grown complex and the Company 
had been forced to agree to re- 



linquish a great many planets that 
it had colonized. Gundersen, like 
most of the fifteen thousand Com- 
pany people here, had accepted a 
transfer to another assignment. 
Cullen, to Gundersen’s amaze- 
ment, had been among the hand- 
ful who had opted to stay, even 
though that meant severing his 
ties with the home world. Gunder- 
sen had not asked him why. One 
did not discuss such things. But 
Cullen’s choice had seemed odd. 



DOWNWARDTOTHE EARTH 



99 




He saw Cullen clearly in mem- 
ory, chasing bugs through the Sea 
of Dust, killing bottle jouncing 
against his hip as he ran from one 
rock outcropping to the next — an 
overgrown boy, really. The beauty 
of the Sea of Dust was altogether 
lost on him. No sector of the plan- 
et was more truly alien, nor more 
spectacular — a dry oceanbed, 
greater in size than the Altantic, 
coated with a thick layer of fine 
crystalline mineral fragments as 
bright as mirrors when the sun 
was on them. From the station 
at Fire Point one could see the 
morning light advancing out of 
the east like a river of flame, spil- 
ling forth until the whole desert 
blazed. The crystals swallowed en- 
ergy all day and gave it forth all 
night, so that even at twilight the 
eerie radiance rose brightly and 
after dark a throbbing purplish 
glow lingered for hours. In this 
almost lifeless but wondrously 
beautiful desert the Company had 
mined a dozen precious metals 
and thirty precious and semi- 
precious stones. The mining ma- 
chines set forth from the station 
on far-ranging rounds, grinding 
up loveliness and returning with 
treasure — there was not much for 
an agent to do there except keep 
inventory of the mounting wealth 
and play host to the tourist par- 
ties that came to see the splendor 
of the countryside. 

Gundersen had grown terribly 
bored and even the glories of the 
scenery had become tiresome to 
him. But Cullen, to whom the in- 
candescent desert was merely a 
flashy nuisance, fell back on his 



hobby for entertainment and 
filled bottle after bottle with his 
insects. Were the mining machines 
still standing in the Sea of Dust, 
Gundersen wondered, waiting for 
the command to resume opera- 
tion? If the Company had not tak- 
en them away after relinquish- 
ment they would surely stand there 
throughout all eternity, unrusting, 
useless, amid the hideous gouges 
they had cut. The machines had 
scooped down through the crystal- 
line layer to the dull basalt below. 
They had spewed out vast heaps 
of tailings and debris as they 
gnawed for wealth. Probably the 
Company had left the things be- 
hind as monuments to commerce. 
Machinery was cheap. Interstellar 
transport was costly, why bother 
removing them? 

“In another thousand years,” 
Gundersen once had said, “the 
Sea of Dust will all be destroyed 
and there’ll be nothing but rubble 
here if these machines continue to 
chew up the rock at the present 
rate.” 

Cullen had shrugged and 
smiled. 

“Well, one won’t need to wear 
these dark glasses once the infernal 
glare is gone,” he had said. 

Now the rape of the desert was 
over, the machines were still and 
Cullen was a fugitive in the mist 
country, wanted for some crime so 
terrible the nildoror would not 
even give it a name.

W HEN they took to the road 
in the morning it was Srin’-

gahar, uncharacteristically, who 
opened the conversation. 

“Tell me of elephants, friend of 
my journey. What do they look 
like and how do they live?” 

“Where did you hear of ele- 
phants?” 

“The Earthpeople at the hotel 
spoke of them. And also in the 
past I have heard the word said. 
They are beings of Earth that look 
like nildoror, are they not?” 
“There is a certain resem- 
blance,” Gundersen conceded. 

“A close one?” 

“There are many similarities.” 
He wished Srin’gahar were able to 
comprehend a sketch. “They are 
long and high in the body, like 
you, and they have four legs, tails, 
trunks. They have tusks, but only 
two — one here, one here. Their 
eyes are smaller and placed in a 
poor position, here, here. And 
here — ” he indicated Srin’gahar’ s 
skull-crest — “they have nothing. 
Also, their bones do not move as 
yours do.” 

“It sounds to me,” said Srin’- 
gahar, “as though these elephants 
look very much like nildoror.” 

“I suppose they do.” 

“Why is this, can you say? Do 
you believe that we and the ele- 
phants can be of the same race?” 
“It isn’t possible,” said Gunder- 
sen. “It’s simply a — a — ” He 
groped for words. The nildoror 
vocabulary did not include the 
technical terms of genetrics. “Sim- 
ply a pattern in the development 
of life that occurs on many 
worlds. Certain basic designs of 
living creatures recur everywhere. 
The elephant design — the nildoror 



design — is one of them. The large 
body, the huge head, the short 
necic, the long trunk enabling the 
being to pick up objects and han- 
dle them without having to bend 
— these things will develop wher- 
ever the proper conditions are 
found.” 

“You have seen elephants, then, 
on many other worlds?” 

“On some,” Gundersen said. 
“Following the same general pat- 
tern of construction. Or at least 
some aspects of it, although the 
closest resemblance of all is be- 
tween elephants and nildoror. I 
could tell you of a half-dozen other 
creatures that seem to belong to 
the same group. And this is also 
true of many other life-forms — in- 
sects, reptiles, small mammals and 
so on. There are certain niches to 
be filled on every world. The 
thoughts of the Shaping Force 
travel the same path everywhere.” 
“Where, then, are Belzagor’s 
equivalents of men?” 

Gundersen faltered. “I didn’t 
say that there were exact equiva- 
lents everywhere. The closest 
thing to the human pattern on 
your planet, I guess, is the suli- 
doror. And they aren’t very 
close.” 

“On Earth, the men rule. Here 
the sulidoror are the secondary 
race.” 

“An accident of development. 
Your G’rakh is superior to that of 
the sulidoror — on our world we 
have no species other than man 
that possess G’rakh at all. But 
the physical resemblances be- 
tween men and sulidoror are 
many. They walk on two legs — 

101 



DOWNWARDTOTHE EARTH 



so do we. They eat both flesh and 
fruit — so do we. They have hands 
which can grasp things — so do we. 
Their eyes are in front of their 
heads — so are ours. I know, 
they’re bigger, stronger, hairier, 
and less intelligent than human 
beings. Fm trying to show you 
how patterns can be similar on 
different planets, even though 
there’s no real blood relationship 
between — ” 

Srin’gahar said quietly, “How 
do you know that elephants are 
without G’rakhl” 

“We — they — it’s clear — ’’ Gun- 
dersen stopped, uneasy. After a 
pause he said carefully, “They’ve 
never demonstrated any of the 
qualities of G’rakh. They have 
no village life, no tribal structure, 
no technology, no religion, no con- 
tinuing culture. 

“We have no village life and no 
technology,” the nildor said. “We 
wander through the jungles, stuf- 
fing ourselves with leaves and 
branches. I have heard this said 
of us — and it is true.” 

“But you’re different. You — ” 

“How are we different? Ele- 
phants also wander through jun- 
gles, stuffing themselves with 
leaves and branches, do they not? 
They wear no skins over their own 
skins. They make no machines. 
They have no books. Yet you ad- 
mit that we have G’rakh and you 
insist that they do not.” 

“They can’t communicate 
ideas,” said Gundersen desperate- 
ly. “They can tell each other sim- 
ple things, I guess, about food and 
mating and danger, but that’s all. 
If they have a true language we 



can’t detect it. We’re aware of on- 
ly a few basic sounds.” 

“Perhaps their language is so 
complex that you are unable to 
detect it,” Srin’gahar suggested. 

“I doubt that. We were able to 
tell as soon as we got here that the 
nildoror speak a language; and we 
were able to learn it. But in all the 
thousands of years that men and 
elephants have been sharing the 
same planet, we’ve never been able 
to see a sign that they can gather 
and transmit abstract concepts. 
And that’s the essence of having 
G’rakh, isn’t it?” 

“I repeat my statement. What 
if you are so inferior to your ele- 
phants that you cannot compre- 
hend their true depths?” 

“A cleverly put point, Srin’- 
gahar. But I won’t accept it as 
any sort of description of the real 
world. If elephants have G’rakh, 
why haven’t they managed to get 
anywhere in their whole time on 
Earth? Why does mankind dom- 
inate the planet — with the ele- 
phants crowded into a couple of 
small corners and practically 
wiped out?” 

“You kill your elephants?” 

“Not any more. But there was 
a time when men killed elephants 
for pleasure, or for food, or to use 
their tusks for ornaments. And 
there was a time when men used 
elephants for beasts of burden. If 
the elephants had G’rakh, they — ” 
He realized that he had fallen 
into Srin’gahar’s trap. 

T he nildor said, “On this plan- 
et, too, the ‘elephants’ let 
themselves be exploited by man- 



102 



GALAXY 



kind. You did not eat us and you 
rarely killed us but often you 
made us work for you. And yet 
you admit we are beings of 
G’rakh” 

“What we did here,” said Gun- 
dersen, “was a gigantic mistake. 

And when we came to realize it we 
relinquished your world and got 
off it. But that still doesn’t mean 
that elephants are rational and 
sentient beings. They’re animals, 
Srin’gahar, big simple animals 
and nothing more.” 

“Cities and machines are not 
the only achievements of G’rakh." 

“Where are their spiritual 
achievements, then? What does an 
elephant believe about the nature 
of the universe? What does he 
think about the Shaping Force? 
How does he regard his own place 
in his society?” 

“I do not know,” said Srin’ga- 
har. “And neither do you, friend 
of my journey, because the lan- 
guage of the elephants is closed to 
you. But it is an error to assume 
the absence of G’rakh where you 
are incapable of seeing it.’^ 

“In that case, maybe the mali- 
daror have G'rakh too. And the 
venom-serpents. And the trees, 
and the vines and — ” 

“No,” said Srin’gahar. “On 
this planet only nildoror and 
sulidoror possess G’rakh. This we 
know beyond doubt. On your 
world it is not necessarily the case 
that humans alone have the qual- 
ity of reason.” 

Gundersen saw the futility of 
pursuing the point. Was Srin’- 
gahar a chauvinist defending the 



spiritual supremacy of elephants 
throughout the universe or was he 
deliberately adopting an extreme 
position to expose the arrogances 
and moral vulnerabilities of 
Earth’s imperialism? Gundersen 
did not know. But it hardly mat- 
tered. He thought of Gulliver, dis- 
cussing the intelligence of horses 
with the houyhnhnms. 

“I yield the point,” he said curt- 
ly. “Perhaps some day I’ll bring 
an elephant to Belzagor and let 
you tell me whether or not it has 
G’rakh." 

“I would greet it as a brother.” 

“You might be unhappy over 
the emptiness of your brother’s 
mind,” Gundersen said. 

“Bring me an elephant, friend of 
my journey, and I will be the 
judge of its emptiness,” said Srin’- 
gahar. He fell silent, leaving Gun- 
dersen alone with his shame and 
guilt. 

In silence they followed the 
boiling stream northward. Shortly 
before noon they came to its 
source, a broad bow-shaped lake 
pinched between a double chain 
of steeply rising hills. Clouds of 
oily steam rose from the lake’s 
surface. Thermophilic algae 
streaked its waters, the pink ones 
forming a thin scum on top and 
nearly screening the meshed tan- 
gles of the larger, thicker blue- 
gray plants a short distance un- 
derneath. 

Gundersen felt some interest 
in stopping to examine the lake 
and its unusual life forms. But he 
was strangely reluctant to ask 
Srin’gahar to halt. Srin’gahar was 
not only his carrier — he was his 



DOWNWARD TO THE EARTH 



103 



companion on a journey — and to 
say, tourist fashion, Let’s stop 
here a while, might reinforce the 
nildor’s belief that Earthmen still 
thought of his people merely as 
beasts of burden. So he resigned 
himself to passing up this bit of 
sightseeing. It was not right, he 
told himself, that he should delay 
Srin’gahar’s journey toward re- 
birth merely to gratify a whim of 
idle curiosity. 

But as they were nearing the 
lake’s farther curve, such a crash- 
ing and smashing in the under- 
brush came from the east that 
the entire procession of nildoror 
paused to see what was going on. 
To Gundersen it sounded as if 
some prowling dinosaur were 
about to come lurching out of the 
jungle, some huge clumsy tyran- 
nosaur inexplicably displaced in 
time and space. Then, emerging 
from a break in the row of hills, 
there came slowly across the bare 
soil flaking the lake a little 
snubsnouted vehicle. Gundersen 
recognized it as the hotel’s beetle. 
It towed a crazy primitive-looking 
appendage of a trailer, fashioned 
from raw planks and large wheels. 
Atop this jouncing, clattering 
trailer four small tents had been 
pitched, covering most of its area. 
Alongside the tents, over the 
wheels, luggage was mounted in 
several racks. At the rear, cling- 
ing to a railing and peering ner- 
vously about, were the eight tour- 
ists whom Gundersen had last 
seen some days earlier in the 
hotel by the coast. 

Srin’gahar said, “Here are some 
of your people. You will want to 



talk with them. I’ll wait for you.” 

T he tourists were, in fact, the 
last species whatever that 
Gundersen wanted to see at this 
point. He would have preferred lo- 
custs, scorpions, fanged serpents, 
tyrannosaurs, toads, anything at 
all. Here he was coming from 
some sort of mystical experience 
among the nildoror, the nature of 
which he barely understood; here, 
insulated from his own kind, he 
rode toward the land of rebirth 
struggling with basic questions of 
right and wrong, of the nature of 
intelligence, of the relationship of 
human to nonhuman and of him- 
self to his own past; only a few 
moments before he had been 
forced into an uncomfortable, even 
painful confrontation with that 
past by Srin’gahar’s casual, artful 
questions about the souls of ele- 
phants; and abruptly Gundersen 
found himself once more amqng 
these empty, trivial human be- 
ings, these archetypes of the igno- 
rant and blind tourist — and what- 
ever individuality he had earned 
in the eyes of his nildor companion 
vanished instantly as he dropped 
back into the undifferentiated 
class of Earthmen. These tourists, 
some part of his mind knew, were 
not nearly as vulgar and hollow as 
he saw them. They were merely 
ordinary people, friendly, a bit 
foolish, overprivileged, probably 
quite satisfactory human beings 
within the context of their lives on 
Earth — and only seeming to be 
cardboard figurines here because 
they were essentially irrelevant to 
the planet they had chosen to visit. 



104 



GALAXY 



But he was not yet ready to have 
Srin’gahar lose sight of him as a 
person separate from all the other 
Earthmen who came to Belzagor. 
And he feared that the tide of 
bland chatter welling out of these 
people would engulf him and make 
him one of them. 

The beetle, obviously straining 
to haul the trailer, came to rest a 
dozen meters from the edge of the 
lake. Out of it came Van Beneker, 
looking sweatier and seedier than 
usual. 

“All right,” he called to the 
tourists. “Everyone down! We’re 
going to have a look at one of the 
famous hot lakes!” 

The four Earth couples clam- 
bered down from their trailer. 
They seemed bored and glazed, 
surfeited with the alien wonders 
they had already seen. Stein, the 
helix-parlor proprietor, dutifully 
checked the aperture of his cam- 
era, mounted it in his cap, and 
routinely took a 360° hologram of 
the scene. But when the printout 
emerged from the camera’s output 
slot a moment later he did not 
even bother to glance at it. The 
act of picture-taking, not the pic- 
ture itself, was significant. Watson, 
the doctor, muttered a joyless joke 
of some sort to Christopher, the 
financier, who responded with a 
mechanical chuckle. The women, 
bedraggled and jungle-stained 
paid no attention to the lake. Two 
simply leaned against the beetle 
and waited to be told what it was 
they were being shown, while the 
other two, as they became aware 
of Gunderson’s presence, pulled 
facial masks from their backpacks 



and hurriedly slipped the thin 
plastic films over their heads so 
that they could present at least the 
illusion of properly groomed fea- 
tures before the handsome strang- 
er. 

“I won’t stay here long,” Gun- 
derson heard himself promising 
Srin’gahar as he dismounted. 

Van Beneker came up to him. 
“What a trip,” the little man 
blurted. “What a stinking trip! 
Well, I ought to be used to it by 
now. How’s everything been going 
for you?” 

“No complaints.” Gundersen 
nodded at the trailer. “Where’d 
you get that noisy contraption?” 
“We built it a couple of years 
ago when one of the old cargo 
haulers broke down. Now we use 
it to take tourists around when we 
can’t get any nildoror bearers.” 

“It looks like something out of 
the eighteenth century.” 

“Well, you know, sir, out here 
we don’t have much in the way of 
modern equipment. We’re short of 
servos and ^draulic walkers and 
all that. But you can always find 
wheels and some planks around. 
We make do.” 

“What happened to the nildoror 
we were riding coming from the 
spaceport to the hotel? I thought 
they were willing to work for you.” 
“Sometimes yes, sometimes 
no,” Van Beneker said. “They’re 
unpredictable. We can’t force 
them to work and we can’t hire 
them to work. We can only ask 
them politely and if they say 
they’re not available, that’s it. 
Couple of days back they decided 
they weren’t going to be available 



DOWNWARDTOTHE EARTH

for a while, so we had to get out 
the trailer.” He lowered his voice. 
“If you ask me, it’s on account of 
these eight baboons here. They 
think the nildoror don’t under- 
stand any English, and they keep 
telling each other how terrible it is 
that we had to hand a planet as 
valuable as this over to a bunch of 
elephants.” 

“On the voyage out here,” said 
Gundersen, “some of them were 
voicing quite strong liberal views. 
At least two of them were big pro- 
relinquishment people.” 

“Sure. Back on Earth they 
bought relinquishment as a politi- 
cal theory. ‘Give the colonized 
worlds back to their long-op- 
pressed natives — ’ and all that. 
Now they’re out here and .suddenly 
they’ve decided that the nildoror 
aren’t natives, just animals, just 
funny-looking elephants — and 
maybe we should have kept the 
place after all.” Van Beneker spat. 
“And the nildoror take it all in. 
They pretend they don’t under- 
stand the language but they do — 
they do. You think they feel like 
hauling people like that on their 
backs?” 

“I see,” said Gundersen. 

He glanced at the tourists. They 
were eyeing Srin’gahar, who had 
wandered off toward the bush and 
was energetically ripping soft 
boughs loose for his midday meal. 
Watson nudged Miraflores, who 
quirked his lips and shook his 
head as if in disapproval. Evident- 
ly civilized beings were not sup- 
posed to pull their meals off trees 
with their trunks. 

Van Beneker said, “You’ll stay 



and have lunch with us, won’t 
you?” 

“That’s very kind of you.” 

H e squatted in the shade 
while Van Beneker rounded 
up his charges and led them to the 
rim of the steaming lake. When 
they were all there Gundersen rose 
and quietly affiliated himself with 
the group. He listened to the 
guide’s spiel but managed to train 
only half his attention on what 
was being said.

Now, unhooking a biosensitive 
net from his belt. Van Beneker be- 
gan to dredge up samples of the 
lake’s fauna for the edification of 



106 



GALAXY 



his group. He gripped the net’s 
handle and made vernier adjust- 
ments governing the mass and 
length of the desired prey. The 
net, mounted at the end of an al- 
most infinitely expandable length 
of fine flexible metal coil, swept 
back and forth beneath the surface 
of the lake, hunting for organisms 
of the programed dimensions. 
When its sensors told it that it was 
in the presence of living matter, 
its mouth snapped open and 
quickly shut again. Van Beneker 
retracted it, bringing to shore 
some unhappy prisoner trapped 
within a sample of its own scald- 
ing environment. 

Out came one lake creature af- 
ter another, red-skinned, boiled- 
looking but alive and angry and 
flapping. An armored fish 
emerged, concealed in shining 
plates, embellished with fantastic 
excrescences and ornaments. A 
lobster like thing came forth, lash- 
ing a long spiked tail, waving fero- 
cious eye-stalks. Up from the lake 
came something that was a single 
immense claw with a tiny vestigial 
body. No two of Van ‘Beneker’s 
grotesque catches were alike. The 
heat of the lake, he repeated, in- 
duced frequent mutations. He rat- 
tled off the whole genetic explana- 
tion a second time, while dumping 
one little monster back into the 
hot bath and probing for the next. 

The genetic aspects of the ther- 
mophilic creatures seemed to catch 
the interest of only one of the tour- 
ists — Stein, who, as a helix-parlor 
owner specializing in the cos- 
metic editing of human genes, 
would know more than a little 



about mutation himself. He asked 
a few intelligent-sounding ques- 
tions, which Van Beneker natur- 
ally was unable to answer. The 
others simply stared, patiently 
waiting for their guide to finish 
showing them funny animals and 
take them somewhere else. 

Gundersen glanced around and 
discovered that Srin’gahar was 
nowhere in sight. 

“What we’ve got this time,” Van 
Beneker was saying, “is the most 
dangerous animal of the lake — 
what we call a razor shark. Only 
I’ve never seen one like this be- 
fore. You see those little horns? 
Absolutely new. And that lantern 
sort of thing on top of the head, 
blinking on and off?” Squirming 
in the net was a slender crimson 
creature about a meter in length. 
Its entire underbelly, from snout 
to gut, was hinged, forming what 
amounted to one gigantic mouth 
rimmed by hundreds of needlelike 
teeth. As the mouth opened and 
closed, it seemed as if the whole 
animal were splitting apart and 
healing itself. This beast feeds on 
anything up to three times its own 
size,” Van Beneker said. “As you 
can see, it’s fierce, savage and — ” 

Uneasy, Gundersen drifted 
away from the lake to look for 
Srin’gahar. He found the place 
where the nildor had been eating, 
where the lower branches of sev- 
eral trees were stripped bare. He 
saw what seemed to be the nildor’s 
trail, leading away into the jungle. 
A painful white light of desolation 
flared in his skull at the awareness 
that Srin’gahar must quietly have 
abandoned him. 



107 



In that case his journey would 
have to be interrupted. He did not 
dare go alone and on foot into that 
pathless wilderness ahead. 

T he tour group was coming up 
from the lake. Van Beneker’s 
net was slung over his shoulder. 
Gundersen saw some lake crea- 
tures moving slowly about in it. 

“Lunch,” he said. “I got us some 
jelly-crabs. You hungry?” 

Gundersen managed a thin 
smile. He watched, not at all hun- 
gry, as Van Beneker opened the 
net. A gush of hot water rushed 
from it, carrying along eight or ten 
oval, purplish creatures, each dif- 
ferent from the others in the num- 
ber of legs, shell markings and 
size of claws. They crawled in 
stumbling circles, obviously an- 
noyed by the realative coolness of 
the air. Steam rose from their 
backs. Expertly Van Beneker 
pithed them with sharpened 
sticks and cooked them with his 
fusion torch. He split open their 
shells to reveal the pale, quivering, 
jelly like metabolic regulators 
within. Three of the women gri- 
maced and turned away but Mrs. 
Miraflores took her crab and ate 
it with delight. The men seemed to 
enjoy it. Gundersen, merely nib- 
bling at the jelly, eyed the forest 
and worried about Srin’gahar. 

Scraps of conversation drifted 
toward him. 

“ — enormous profit potential, 
just wasted, altogether wasted . ” 
“ — even so our obligation is to 
encourage self-determination on 
every planet that. .” 

“ — but are they people?” 

108 



“ — look for the soul, it’s the only 
way to tell that ...” 

“ — elephants and nothing but 
elephants. Did you see him rip- 
ping up the trees and . .” 

“ — relinquishment was the fault 
of a highly vocal minority of bleed- 
ing hearts who . .” 

“ — no soul, no relinquish- 
ment . .” 

“ — you’re being too harsh, dear. 
There were definite abuses on 
some of the planets and . .” 

“ — stupid political expediency, 
I call it. The blind leading the 
blind . .” 

“ — can they write? Can they 
think? Even in Africa we were deal- 
ing with human beings and even 
there . .” 

“ — I don’t need to tell you how 
much 1 favored relinquishment. 
You remember, I took the peti- 
tions around and everything. But 
even so, I have to admit that after 
seeing ...” 

“ — piles of purple crap on the 
beach . .” 

“ — victims of sentimental over- 
reaction ...” 

“ — I understand the annual 
profit was on the order of . .” 

“ — no doubt that they have 
souls. No doubt at all.” Gunder- 
sen realized that his own voice had 
entered the conversation. The 
others turned to him — there was 
a sudden vacuum to fill. He said, 
“They have a religion and that 
implies the awareness of the exis- 
tence of a spirit, a soul, doesn’t 
it?” 

“What kind of religion?” Mira- 
flores asked. 

“I’m not sure. One important 
GALAXY 



part of it is ecstatic dancing — a 
kind of frenzied prancing around 
that leads to some sort of mystic 
experience. I know. I’ve danced 
with them. I’ve felt at least the 
edges of that experience. And 
they’ve got a thing called rebirth, 
which I suppose is central to their 
rituals. I don’t understand it. They 
go north into the mist country and 
something happens to them there. 
They’ve always kept the details 
a secret. I think the sulidoror give 
them something, some drug, may- 
be, and it rejuvenates them in 
some inner way and leads to a kind 
of illumination — am I at all clear?” 
Gundersen, as he spoke, was work- 
ing his way almost unconsciously 
through the pile of uneaten jelly- 
crabs. “All I can tell you is that 
rebirth is vitally important to them 
and they seem to derive their tri- 
bal status from the number of re- 
births they’ve undergone. So you 
see they’re not just animals. They 
have a society. They have a cul- 
tural structure — complex, difficult 
for us to grasp.” 

Watson asked, “Why don’t they 
have a civilization, then?” 

“I’ve just told you they do.” 

“I mean cities, machines, 
books — ” 

“They’re not physically 
equipped for writing, for building 
things, for any small manipula- 
tions,” Gundersen said. “Don’t 
you see, they have no hands? A 
race with hands makes one kind 
of society. A race built like ele- 
phants makes another.” He was 
drenched in sweat and his appe- 
tite was suddenly insatiable. The 
women, he noticed, were staring at 

DOWNWARDTOTHE EARTH 



him strangely. He realized why. 
He was cleaning up all the food in 
sight, compulsively stuffing it into 
his mouth. Abruptly his patience 
shattered and he felt that his skull 
would explode if he did not in- 
stantly drop all barriers and ad- 
mit the one great guilt that by 
stabbing his soul had spurred him 
into strange odysseys. It dijJ not 
matter that these were not the 
right people from whom to seek ab- 
solution. The words rushed un- 
controllably upward to his lips 
and he said, “When I came here 
I was just like you. I underesti- 
mated the nildoror, whifh led 
me into a grievous sin that I have 
to explain to you. You know, I 
was a sector administrator for a 
while. One of my jobs was ar- 
ranging the efficient deployment 
of native labor. Since we didn’t 
fully understand that the nildoror 
were intelligent, autonomous be- 
ings, we used them — we put them 
to work on heavy construction 
jobs, lifting girders with their 
trunks, anything we thought they 
were capable of handling on sheer 
muscle alone. We just ordered 
them around as if they were ma- 
chines.” Gundersen closed his 
eyes and felt the past roaring to- 
ward him, inexorably, a black 
cloud of memory that enveloped 
and overwhelmed him. “The nil- 
doror let us use them, God knows 
why. I guess we were the crucible 
in which their race had to be 
purged. Well, one day a dam 
broke, out in Monroe District up 
in the north, not far from where 
the mist country begins, and a 
whole thornbush plantation was 



109 



in danger of flooding, at a loss to 
the Company of who knows how 
many millions. And the main pow- 
er plant of the district was endan- 
gered, too, along with our station 
headquarters and — let’s just say 
that if we didn’t react fast, we’d 
lose our entire investment in the 
north. My responsibility. I began 
conscripting nildoror to build a 
secondary line of dikes. We threw 
every robot we had into the job 
but we didn’t have enough, so we 
got the nildoror, too — long lines 
of them plodding in from every 
part of the jungle — and we worked 
day and night until we were all 
ready to fall down dead. We were 
beating the flood but I couldn’t be 
sure of it. And on the sixth morn- 
ing I drove out to the dike site to 
see if the next crest would break 
through — and there were seven 
nildoror I hadn’t ever seen before, 
marching along a path going 
north. I told them to follow me. 
They refused, very gently. They 
said, no, they were on their way 
to the mist country for the rebirth 
ceremony and they couldn’t stop. 
Rebirth? What did I care about 
rebirth? I wasn’t going to take that 
excuse from them, not when it 
looked like I might lose my whole 
district. Without thinking I or- 
dered them to report for dike duty 
or I’d execute them on the spot. 
Rebirth can wait, I said. Get re- 
born some other time. This is 
serious business. They put their 
heads down and pushed the tips of 
their tusks into the ground. That’s 
a sign of great sadness among 
them. Their spines drooped. Sad. 
Sad. We pity you, one of them 



said to me, and I got angry and 
told him what he could do with 
his pity. Where did he get the 
right to pity me? Then I pulled 
out my fusion torch. Go on, get 
moving, there’s a work crew that 
needs you. Sad. Big eyes looking 
pity at me. Tusks in the ground. 
Two or three of the nildoror said 
they were very sorry, they couldn’t 
do any work for me now, it was 
impossible for them to break their 
journey. But they were ready to die 
right there if I insisted on it. They 
didn’t want to hurt my prestige by 
defying me but they had to defy 
me — so they were willing to pay 
the price. I was about to fry one 
as an example to the others. And 
then I stopped and said to my- 
self, What the hell am I doing? 
The nildoror waited and my aides 
were watching and so were some 
of our other nildoror. I lifted the 
fusion torch again, telling myself 
that I’d kill one of them — the one 
who said he pitied me — hoping 
that then the others would come 
to their senses. They just waited. 
Calling my bluff. How could 1 fry 
seven pilgrims even if they were 
defying a sector chief’s direct or- 
der? But my authority was at 
stake. So I pushed the trigger. I 
just gave him a slow burn, not 
deep, enough to scar the hide, that 
was all, but the nildor stood there 
taking it. In another few minutes 
I would have burned right through 
to a vital organ. And so I soiled 
myself in front of them by using 
force. It was what they had been 
waiting for. Then a couple of the 
nildoror who looked older than 
the others said, stop it, we wish 



no 



GALAXY 



to reconsider. I turned off the 
torch and they went aside for a 
conference. The one I had burned 
was hobbling a little and looked 
hurt. But he wasn’t badly 
wounded, not nearly as badly as I 
was. The one who pushes the trig- 
ger can get hurt worse than his 
target, do you know that? And in 
the end the nildoror all agreed to 
do as I asked. So instead of going 
north for rebirth they went to work 
on the dike — even the burned one 
— and nine days later the flood 
crest subsided and the plantation 
and the power plant and all the 
rest were saved and we lived hap- 
pily ever after.” 

G UNDERSEN’S voice trailed 
off. He had made his confes- 
sion and now he could not face 
these people any longer. He picked 
up the shell of the one remaining 
crab and explored it for some 
scrap of jelly, feeling depleted and 
drained. There was an endless 
span of silence. 

Then Mrs. Christopher said, 
“So what happened then?” 

Gundersen looked up, blinking. 
He thought he had told it all. 

“Nothing happened then,” he 
said. “The flood crest subsided.” 
“But what was the point of the 
story?” 

He wanted to hurl the empty 
crab into her tensely smiling face. 

“The point?” he said. “The 
point? Why — ” He was dizzy now. 
He said, “Seven intelligent beings 
were journeying toward the holiest 
rite of their religion and at gun- 
point I requisitioned their services 
on a construction job to save prop- 

DOWNWARDTOTHE EARTH 



erty that meant nothing to them 
— and they came and hauled logs 
for me. Isn’t the point obvious 
enough? Who was spiritually su- 
perior there? When you treat a ra- 
tional autononomous creature as 
though he were a mere beast — 
what does that make you?” 

“But it was an emergency,” said 
Watson. “You needed all the help 
you could get. Surely other con- 
siderations could be laid aside at 
a time like that. So they were nine 
days late getting to their rebirth. 
Is that so bad?” 

Gundersen said hollowly, “A 
nildor goes to rebirth only when 
the time is ripe. I can’t tell you 
how they know the time is ripe 
but perhaps it’s astrological, some- 
thing to do with the conjunction of 
the moons. A nildor has to get to 
the place of rebirth at the propi- 
tious time and if he doesn’t make 
it in time, he isn’t reborn just then. 
Those seven nildoror were already 
late because the heavy rains had 
washed out the roads in the south. 
The nine days more that I tacked 
on made them too late. When 
they were finished building dikes 
for me, they simply went back 
south to rejoin their tribe. I didn’t 
understand why. It wasn’t until 
much later that I found out that I 
had cost them their chance at re- 
birth and they rnight have to wait 
ten or twenty years until they 
could go again. Or maybe never 
get another chance.” 

Gundersen did not feel like talk- 
ing any more. His throat was dry. 
His temples throbbed. How clean- 
sing it would be, he thought, to 
dive into the steaming lake. He got 

111 



stiffly to his feet and, as he did so, 
noticed that Srin’gahar had re- 
turned and was standing motion- 
less a few hundred meters away, 
beneath a mighty swordflower 
tree. 

He said to the tourists, “The 
point is that the nildoror have re- 
ligion and souls and that they are 
people — and that if you can buy 
the concept of relinquishment at 
all, you can’t object to relinquish- 
ing this planet. The point is also 
that when Earthmen collide with 
an alien species they usually do so 
with maximum misunderstanding. 
The point is furthermore that I’m 
not surprised you think of the nil- 
doror the way you do. I did, too, 
and learned a little better when it 
was too late to matter. And even so 
I didn’t learn enough to do me any 
real good, which is one of the rea- 
sons why I came back to this plan- 
et. And I’d like you to excuse me 
now. This is the propitious time 
for me to move on and I have to 

go.” 

He walked quickly away. 

Approaching Srin’gahar, he 
said, “I’m ready to leave.” 

“Where did you go?” the Earth- 
men asked. “I was worried when 
you disappeared.” 

“I felt that I should leave you 
alone with your friends,” said 
Srin’gahar. “Why did you worry? 
There is an obligation on me to 
bring you safely to the country of 
the mist.” 

VHI 

T he quality of the land was 
undoubtedly changing. They 



were leaving the heart of the equa- 
torial jungle behind and were 
starting to enter the highlands that 
led into the mist zone. The climate 
here was still tropical but the hu- 
midity was not so intense. The at- 
mosphere, instead of holding 
everything in a constant clammy 
embrace, released its moisture per- 
iodically in rain and after the rain 
the texture of the air was clear 
and light until its wetness was re- 
newed. 

Different vegetation featured 
this region — harsh-looking angu- 
lar stuff, with stiff leaves sharp as 
blades. Many of the trees had 
luminous foliage that cast a cold 
light over the forest by night. The 
vines were fewer here and the 
treetops no longer formed a con- 
tinuous canopy shutting out most 
of the sunlight. Splashes of bright- 
ness dappled the forest floor, in 
some places extending across 
broad open meadows. The soil, 
leached by the frequent rains, .was 
a yellowish hue, not the rich black 
of the jungle. Small animals fre- 
quently sped through the under- 
brush. At a slower pace moved sol- 
emn sluglike creatures, blue-green 
with ebony mantles, which Gun- 
dersen recognized as the mobile 
fungoids of the highlands — plants 
that crawled from place to place in 
quest of fallen boughs or a light- 
ning-shattered tree trunk. Both 
nildoror and men considered their 
taste a great delicacy. 

On the evening of the third day 
northward from the place of the 
boiling lake, Srin’gahar and Gun- 
dersen came upon the other four 
nildoror, who had marched on 



112 



GALAXY 



ahead. They were camped at the 
foot of a jagged crescent-shaped 
hill. With them was a sulidor, by 
far the largest one Gundersen had 
ever seen, almost twice Gunder- 
sen’s own height, with a pendulous 
snout the length of a man’s fore- 
arm. The sulidor stood erect be- 
side a boulder encrusted with blue 
moss, his legs spread wide and his 
tail, tripod-fashion, bracing his 
mighty weight. Narrowed eyes sur- 
veyed Gundersen from beneath 
shadowy hoods. His long arms, 
tipped with terrifying, curved 
claws, hung at rest. The fur of the 
sulidor was the color of old bronze 
and unusually thick. 

One of the candidates for re- 
birth, a female nildor called 
Luu’khamin, said to Gundersen, 
“The sulidor’s name is Na-sinisul. 
He wishes to speak with you.” 

“Let him speak, then.” 

“He prefers that you know, first, 
that he is not a sulidor of the or- 
dinary kind. He is one of those 
who administers the ceremony of 
rebirth and we will see him again 
when we approach the mist coun- 
try. He is a sulidor of rank and 
merit and his words are not to be 
taken lightly. Will you bear that in 
mind as you listen to him?” 

The sulidor strode a short dis- 
tance forward and once again 
planted himself firmly, digging his 
great spurred feet deep into the 
resilient soil. He spoke in nildor- 
oru stamped with the accent of the 
north: thick-tongued, slow, pos- 
itive. 

“I have been on a journey,” said 
Na-sinisul, “to the Sea of Dust, 
and now I am returning to my own 
land to aid in the preparations for 

DOWNWARDTOTHE EARTH 



the event of rebirth in which these 
five travelers are to take part. My 
presence here is purely accidental. 
Do you understand that I am not 
in this place for any particular 
purpose involving you or your 
companions?” 

“I understand,” said Gundersen, 
astounded by the precise and em- 
phatic manner of the sulidor’s 
speech. He had known the suli- 
doror only as dark, savage, fer- 
ocious-looking figures lurking in 
mysterious glades. 

Na-sinisul continued: “As I 

passed near here yesterday, I came 
by chance to the site of a former 
station of your Company. Again 
by chance I chose to look within, 
though it was no business of mine 
to enter that place. Within I found 
two Earthmen whose bodies had 
ceased to serve them. They were 
unable to move and could barely 
talk. They requested me to send 
them from this world but I could 
not do such a thing on my own 
authority. Therefore I ask you to 
follow me to this station and to 
give me instructions.” 

“How far is it?” 

“We could be there before the 
rising of the third moon.” 

Gundersen said to Srin’gahar, “I 
don’t remember a Company station 
here. There should be one a couple 
of days north of here but — ” 

“This is the place where the 
food that crawls was collected and 
shipped downriver,” the Nildor 
informed him. 

“Here?” Gundersen shrugged. “I 
guess I’ve lost my bearings again. 
All right. I’ll go there.” To Na-si- 
nisul he said, “Lead and I’ll fol- 
low.” 



113 



T he sulidor moved swiftly 
through the glowing forest, 
and Gundersen, atop Srin’gahar, 
rode just to his rear. They seemed 
to be descending. The air grew 
warm and murky. The landscape 
also changed, for the trees here 
had aerial roots that looped up 
like immense scraggy elbows and 
the fine tendrils sprouting from 
the roots emitted a harsh green 
radiance. The soil was loose and 
rocky. Gundersen could hear it 
crunching under Srin’gahar’s 
tread. Birdlike things were 
perched on many of the roots. 
They were owlish creatures — some 
were black, some white, some a 
mottled black and white. A sticky 
fragrance came from vast, pallid, 
parasitic flowers sprouting from 
the trunks of the trees. 

By an outcropping of naked, 
weathered yellow rock lay the re- 
mains of the Company station. It 
seemed even more thoroughly 
ruined than the serpent station 
far to the south. The dome of its 
roof had collapsed and coils of 
wiry-stemmed saprophytes were 
clinging to its sides, perhaps feed- 
ing on the decomposition products 
that the rain eroded from the 
abrasions in the plastic walls. 
Srin’gahar allowed Gundersen 
to dismount. The Earthman hesi- 
tated outside the building, waiting 
for the sulidor to take the lead. A 
fine warm rain began to fall. The 
tang of the forest changed, be- 
coming sweet where it had been 
sour. But it was the sweetness of 
decay. 

“The Earthmen are inside,” said 
Na-sinisul. “You may go in. I 



shall await your instructions.” 

Gundersen entered the building. 
The reek of rot was far more in- 
tense here. The dampness was per- 
vasive. He wondered what sort of 
virulent spores he sucked into his 
nostrils with every breath. Some- 
thing dripped in the darkness, 
making a loud locking against 
the lighter patter of the rain com- 
ing through the gaping roof. To 
give himself light, Gundersen drew 
his fusion torch and kindled it at 
the lowest beam. The warm white 
glow spread through the station. 
At once he felt a flapping about 
his face as some thermotropic 
creature, aroused and attracted by 
the heat of the torch, rose up to- 
ward it. Gundersen brushed it 
away, found slime on his finger- 
tips afterward. 

Where were the Earthmen? 

Cautiously he made a circuit of 
the building. He remembered it 
vaguely now — one of the innumer- 
able bush stations the Company 
once had scattered across Hol- 
man’s World. The floor was split 
and warped, requiring him to 
climb over the buckled, sundered 
sections. The mobile fungoids 
crawled everywhere, devouring the 
scum that covered all interior sur- 
faces of the building and leaving 
narrow glistening tracks behind. 
Gundersen had to step Carefully to 
avoid putting his feet on the crea- 
tures and he was not always suc- 
cessful. Now he came to a place 
where the building widened, puck- 
ering outward. He flashed his 
torch around and caught sight of 
a blackened wharf, over-looking 
the bank of a swift river. Yes, he 



114 



GALAXY 



remembered. The fungoids were 
trapped and baled here and sent 
downriver on their voyage toward 
the market. But the Company’s 
barges no longer stopped here and 
the tasty pale slugs now wandered 
unmolested over the mossy relics 
of furniture and equipment. 

“Hello?” Gundersen called. 
“Hello, hello, hello?” 

He received a moan by way of 
answer. Stumbling and slipping in 
the dimness, fighting a swelling 
nausea, he forced his way onward 
through a maze of unseen ob- 
stacles. He came to the source of 
the loud dripping sound. Some- 
thing bright red and basket- 
shaped and about the size of a 
man’s chest had established itself 
high on the wall, perpendicular to 
the floor. Through large pores in 
its spongy surface a thick black 
fluid exuded, falling in a contin- 
uous greasy splash. As the light of 
Gundersen’s torch probed it, the 
exudation increased, becoming al- 
most a cataract of tallowy liquid. 
When he moved the light away the 
flow became less copious, though 
still heavy. 

The floor sloped here so that 
whatever dripped from the spongy 
basket flowed quickly down, col- 
lecting at the far side of the room 



in the angle between the floor and 
the wall. Here Gundersen found 
the Earthmen. They lay side by 
side on a low mattress. Fluid from 
the dripping thing had formed a 
dark pool around them, com- 
pletely covering the mattress and 
welling up over their bodies. One 
of the Earthlings, head lolling to 
the side, had his face totally im- 
mersed in the stuff. From the 
other one came the moans. 

Both were naked. And only one 
was a man. The other was a wo- 
man, though Gundersen had some 
difficulty telling that at first. Both 
were so shrunken and emaciated 
that the sexual characteristics 
were obscured. They had no hair, 
not even eyebrows. Bones pro- 
truded through parchment like 
skin. The eyes of both were open, 
fixed in a rigid, seemingly sightless 
stare, unblinking, glassy. Lips 
were drawn back from teeth. Gray- 
ish algae sprouted in the furrows 
of their skins and the mobile fun- 
goids roamed their bodies, feeding 
on this growth. With a quick au- 
tomatic gesture of revulsion Gun- 
dersen plucked two of the slug- 
like creatures from the woman’s 
empty breasts. She stirred, 
moaned again. 

In the language of the nildoror

she murmured, “Is it over yet?” 

Her voice was like a flute played 
by a sullen desert breeze. 

Speaking English, Gundersen 
said, “Who are you? How did this 
happen?” 

He got no response from her. A 
fungoid crept across her mouth, 
and he flicked it aside. He touched 
her cheek. A rasping whisper came 
as his hand ran across her skin. 
He felt he was caressing stiff pa- 
per. 

“Is it over soon?” she asked, 
again in nildororu. 

G undersen turned to her 
companion. Gently, half 
afraid the fragile neck would snap, 
Gundersen lifted the man’s head 
out of the pool of fluid. It ap- 
peared that he had been breathing 
it — it trickled from his nose and 
lips and after a moment he showed 
signs of being unable to cope with 
ordinary air. Gundersen let his 
face slip back into the pool. In 
that brief moment he had rec- 
ognized the man as one Harold — 
or Henry — Dykstra, whom he had 
known distantly in the old days. 

The unknown woman was try- 
ing to move one arm. She lacked 
the strength to lift it. These two 
were like living ghosts, like death- 
in-life, mired in their sticky fluid 
and totally helpless. 

In the language of the nildoror 
Gundersen asked, “How long have 
you been this way?” 

“Forever,” she whispered. 

“Who are you?” 

“I don’t — remember. I’m — wait- 
ing.” 

“For what?” 

116 



“For the end.” 

“Listen,” he said. “I’m Edmund 
Gundersen, who used to be sector 
chief. 1 want to help you.” 

“Kill me first. Then him.” 

“We’ll get you out of here and 
back to the spaceport. We can 
have you on the way to Earth in a 
week or ten days, and then — ” 

“No — please — ” 

“What’s wrong?” he asked. 
“Finish it. Finish it.” 

She found enough strength to 
arch her back, lifting her body 
halfway out of the fluid that nearly 
concealed her lower half. Some- 
thing rippled and briefly bulged 
beneath her skin. Gundersen 
touched the taut belly and felt 
movement within — and that quick 
inward quiver was the most fright- 
ening sensation he had ever 
known. He touched the body of 
Dykstra. It also rippled inwardly. 

Appalled, Gundersen scrambled 
to his feet and backed away from 
them. By faint torchlight he 
studied their shriveled bodies, 
naked but sexless, bone and liga- 
ment, shorn of flesh and spirit yet 
still alive. A terrible fear came over 
him. 

“Na-sinisul,” he called. “Come 
in here — come in!” 

The sulidor shortly was at his 
side. 

Gundersen said, “Something’s 
inside their bodies. Some kind of 
parasite? It moves. What is it?” 
“Look there,” said “Na-sinisul, 
indicating the spongy basket from 
which the dark fluid trickled. 
“They carry its young. They have 
become hosts. A year, two years,

three — and the larvae emerge.” 

Why aren’t they both dead?” 

“They draw nourishment from 
this,” said the sulidor, swishing his 
tail through the black flow. “It 
seeps into their skins. It feeds 
them and it feeds that which is 
within them.” 

“If we took them out of here 
and sent them down to the hotel 
on rafts — ” 

“They would die,” Na-sinisul 
said, “moments after they were re- 
moved from the wetness about 
them. There is no hope of saving 
them.” 

“When does it end?” the woman 
asked. 

Gundersen trembled. All his 
training told him never to accept 
the finality of death. Any human in 
whom some shred of life remained 
could be saved, rebuilt from a few 



scraps of cells into a reasonable 
facsimile of the original. But there 
were no facilities for such things 
on this world. He confronted a 
swirl of choices. Leave them here 
to let alien things feed upon their 
guts? Try to bring them back to 
the spaceport for shipment to the 
nearest tectogenetic hospital? Put 
them out of their misery at once? 
Seek to free their bodies himself 
of whatever held them in thrall? 
He kneeled again. He forced him- 
self to experience that inner quiv- 
ering again. He touched the wo- 
man’s stomach, her thighs, her 
bony haunches. Beneath the skin 
she was a mass of strangeness. Yet 
her mind still ticked, though she 
had forgotten her name and her 
native language. The man was 
luckier. Although he, too, was in- 
fested, at least Dykstra did not 



DOWNWARDTOTHE EARTH 



have to lie here in the dark waiting 
for the death that could come only 
when the harbored larvae erupted 
from the enslaved human flesh. 
Was this what they had desired 
when they refused repatriation 
from this world that they loved? 
An Earthling can become captured 
by Belzagor, the many-born nil- 
dor, Vol’himyor, had said. But this 
was too literal a capture. 

The stink of bodily corruption 
made him retch. 

“Kill them both,” he said to Na- 
sinisul. “And be quick about it.” 

“This is what you instruct me 
to do?” 

“Kill them. And rip down that 
thing on the wall and kill it, too.” 

“It has given no offense,” said 
the sulidor. “It has done only 
what is natural to its kind. By kill- 
ing these two I will deprive it of 
its young — but I am not willing to 
deprive it of life as well.” 

“All right,” Gundersen said. 
“Just the Earthlings, then. Fast.” 

“I do this as an act of mercy, 
under your direct orders,” said Na- 
sinisul. 

He leaned forward and lifted 
one powerful arm. The savage 
curved claws emerged fully from 
their sheaths. The arm descended 
twice. 

Gundersen compelled himself 
to watch. The bodies split like 
dried husks. The things within 
came spilling out, unformed, raw. 
Even now, in some inconceivable 
reflex, the two corpses twitched 
and jerked. Gundersen stared in- 
to their eroded depths. 

“Do you hear me?” he asked. 
“Are you alive or dead?” 

118 



The woman’s mouth gaped but 
no sound came forth and he did 
not know whether this was an at- 
tempt to speak or merely a last 
convulsion of the ravaged nerves. 
He stepped his fusion torch up to 
high power and trained it on the 
dark pool. 

/ am the resurrection and the 
life, he thought, reducing Dykstra 
to ashes, and the woman beside 
him, and the squirming unfinished 
larvae. Acrid, choking fumes rose. 
Not even the torch could destroy 
the building’s dampness. He 
turned the torch back to illumina- 
tion level. 

“Come,” he said to the sulidor 
and they went out together. 

“I feel like burning the entire 
building and purifying this place,” 
Gundersen said to Na-sinisul. 

“I know.” 

“But you would prevent me.” 

“You are wrong. No one on 
this world will prevent you from 
doing anything.” 

But what good would destroying 
the building do, Gundersen asked 
himself? The purification had al- 
ready been accomplished. 

The rain had stopped. To the 
waiting Srin’gahar, Gundersen 
said, “Will you take me away 
from here?” 

They rejoined the other four nil- 
doror. Then, because they had 
lingered too long here and the land 
of rebirth was still far away, they 
resumed the march, even though it 
was night. By morning Gundersen 
could hear the thunder of Shangri- 
la Falls, which the nildoror called 
Du’jayukh.

The Silent Multitude 
D. G. Compton 



Opus 100 
Isaac Asimov 



D . G. COMPTON is this Eng- 
lish fellow whose books Terry 
Carr is beginning to reprint as 
Ace Specials. His first such book 
here, Synthajoy, was an intricate, 
beautifully written fable of techno- 
logy intertwined with the human 
passions and I hope you went out 
and got it. Now we have The Silent 
Multitude (Ace Special 76385, 
75(f), a straightforward, almost 
spare, linear story about the dean 
of Gloucester, a senile recluse, a 



119 



newshen and an angry young man, 
as they wait in Gloucester Cathe- 
dral for the crumbling of the city 
— and the cathedral — under the 
gentle attack of a fungus that 
destroys mortar. 

But for the squads of searching 
policemen quick-stepping stage 
left and right — and a few spear- 
carriers in the opening scenes — 
there is no life at all depicted in 
this novel except Tug, the tomcat, 
and the rat, mouse and sparrow 
he encounters in the evacuated 
city. 

Dean Goodliffe has stayed by 
special dispensation, perhaps be- 
cause it is Christmas Eve, perhaps 
because it is his Christian duty, 
but more probably because he 
can’t believe that, even after the 
fungus has destroyed the motar 
between its antique stones, the 
centuries-old cathedral will do 
more than settle a bit and then 
remain much as before. 

Paper Smith, the hermit, has 
stayed because his mind will not 
accommodate. Tug lives with him 
and in any case is not affected by 
civilization, except in the negative 
sense that the advancing cultura- 
tion of the city has left very few 
other functional males or females 
of his species. 

The girl reporter — another of 
Compton’s really believable 
women — is on the scene because 
where else would a sob sister be? 
The city that has stood since Ro- 
man times is about to fall. 



The angry young man is in re- 
bellion against his late father, a 
well-known architect. 

And there we have them. The 
dean, with his primary tie to stones 
and sentiment; the recluse devoted 
to the past; the girl to whom the 
present is a fascinating entertain- 
ment and the young man to whom 
it is the dead hand of the establish- 
ment. Only Tug, who does not 
know time passes with a drag, 
bounds on through the encroach- 
ment of Fate with merely minor 
pauses for attention as the first 
copings begin to tumble from the 
windows and the cathedral’s first 
cornice comes volplaning down to 
crash through the north transept. 

What we have, obviously, is 
something better and sounder 
than your standard novel of the 
brave little mob facing the return 
of the glaciers or the unending 
rain. The sf element is quickly 
and economically introduced — 
space exploration brought back 
the fungus — and then we’re on to 
something rather reminiscent of 
the James Gould Cozzens of 
Castaway or S'.S'. San Pedro. I’d 
be rather surprised to learn 
Compton hadn’t read or appreci- 
ated those two books. He certainly 
shows every sign of having 
learned how to improve on them. 

The Silent Multitude doesn’t 
have the bite of Synthajoy. It has, 
instead, a growing prescence — a 
well-orchestrated feeling in the 
reader’s mind that the events here 



120 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



depicted do have a significance 
and do contain a statement on the 
human condition. 

I’m not sure Compton will al- 
ways be or has always been a 
science-fiction writer. But he cer- 
tainly is a writer. 

N OW, you take Isaac Asi- 
mov . 

Well, taking him from the pages 
of Opus 100, his hundredth book 
(Houghton Mifflin Company, 
$5.95), one finds him so various, so 
beautiful and new that it is only 
with a wrench of the mind one re- 
calls the last time he pinched one’s 
wife’s bottom. 

But I digress — a sin for which 
the Good Doctor has taxed me in 
the past. Of course, I could tax 
him with the same thing, so per- 
haps we could compromise instead 
on a tax-free foundation. 

That being as it may. Opus 100 
is, indeed, a 311-page digression, 
consisting of excerpts from many 
of his 99 preceding books, con- 
creted together with long or short 
introductory passages. It becomes, 
thus, the autobiography, with 
prose illustrations, of one of our 
foremost science and science- 
fiction writers, raconteurs, profes- 
sors, songsters and wits. 

What a splendid ego this man 
has — and I speak in full fondness. 
No ordinary psyche could fuel so 
rich a career in various forms of 
letters, nor promise yet so much 
for the future. 



In this book, whose very ex- 
istence is a tribute to his ability to 
impress others, Asimov displays’ 
by definition the total range of 
his -past and present capacity. He 
quotes from passages written for 
schoolchildren, for teenagers, for 
intelligent laymen, for medical 
students, for scientists — he even 
quotes from his doctoral disserta- 
tion, which is written in language 
rather different from Lucky Starr 
and the Oceans of Venus. 

And thus we’ve come to one fea- 
ture this book has in common 
with many other recent Asimov 
anthologies of fact or fiction — the 
markedly uneven quality of the 
assembled writing. 

Let’s put aside the special na- 
ture of this book for a moment; 
let’s consider simply the fact that 
the layer-out of the $5.95 plus 
sales tax involved here is either an 
Asimov fan who’d buy anything 
with the great name on it, or else 
is someone who might buy this 
book or some other. What will this 
person find here to justify his 
selection? 

He will find a charming, elo- 
quent auctorial personality. If he 
has any wit, he will find something 
more than either the brash extro- 
vert Ike commonly plays at con- 
vention banquets, or the earnest, 
sensitive, totally trusting confi- 
dant of the quiet pauses for 
breath afterward. People are con- 
siderably complicated, none more

Harlie was a Human Analogue 
Computer — too logical to find 
Man's purpose in living. 




I 

A UBERSON thought about 
going for water but decided 
that to do so was too much trouble. 
He popped the pills directly into 
his mouth and swallowed them 
dry. 

“Don’t you take any water with 
them?” asked Handley, staring as 
he came into the room. 

“Why bother? Either you can 
take ’em or you can’t. Want one?” 
Handley shook his head. 

“Not now. Em on something 
else.” 

“Uppers or downers?” 

“Right now, a bummer.” 

“Oh?” Auberson slid his desk 
drawer shut. “What’s up?” 

“That damned computer 
again.” Handley dropped himself 
into a chair, his long legs sprawl- 
ing out. 

“You mean Harlie?” 

Handley looked at him. “Who 
else? You know another computer 
with delusions of grandeur?” 
“What’s he up to now?” 



123 



“Same thing. But worse than 
ever.” 

Auberson nodded, “I figured it 
would happen. You want me to 
take a look?” 

“That’s what you’re getting paid 
for. You’re the psychologist.” 
Auberson sighed. 

“All right.” He lifted himself 
out of the chair, grabbed his coat 
from the back of the door. “Har- 
lie, 1 think, is getting to be more 
trouble than he’s worth.” 

The two men began the familiar 
walk to the computer control room. 
Handley grinned, matching. strides 
with Auberson. 

“You’re just annoyed because 
every time you think you’ve fig- 
ured out what makes him tick he 
makes a liar out of you.” 

“You could be right. But robot 
psychology is still an infant sci- 
ence. How does anyone know what 
a computer thinks about — espe- 
cially one that’s convinced it can 
cerebrate like a human being?” 
They paused at the elevator. 
“What’re you doing about dinner? 
I have a feeling we’re going to be 
at this all night.” 

Handley shook his head. 
“Nothing yet. Want to send out 
for something?” 

“Yeah, that’s probably what 
we’ll end up doing.” Auberson 
pulled a silver cigarette case from 
his pocket. “Want one?” 

“What are they, Acapulco 
Golds?” 

“Zig-zags.” 



“Good enough.” Handley 
helped himself to one of the mari- 
juana cylinders and puffed it into 
flame, “Frankly, I never thought 
that Zig-zags were as strong as 
they should be.” 

“It’s all in your head.” 

Auberson inhaled deeply. 

“It’s a matter of taste,” cor- 
rected Handley. 

“If you don’t like them, don’t 
smoke them.” 

“It was free.” 

Handley shrugged. 

The elevator arrived then and 
they 'stepped into it. As they 
dropped the fourteen stories to the 
computer level Auberson thought 
he could feel the stuff beginning to 
take effect. That and the pills. 

He took another drag, a long 
one. 

The elevator discharged them in 
a cool climate-conditioned ante- 
room. Beyond the sealed doors 
they could hear the dimly muf- 
fled clatter of typers. A sign on the 
wall facing them read : 

HUMAN ANALOGUE ROBOT 
LIFE INPUT EQUIVALENTS 
PUT OUT CIGARETTES 
BEFORE ENTERING 
THIS MEANS YOU! 

Damn! I always Jorget. 

Auberson stubbed out the stick 
in an ashtray but slipped the butt 
back into his case. No sense wast- 
ing it. 

Inside, he seated himself at Con- 



124 



GALAXY 



sole One without giving so much 
as a glance to the rows and rows of 
gleaming memory banks. 

NOW THEN, HARLIE, he typed. 
WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROB- 
LEM? 

Harlie typed back: 

CIRCLES ARE FULL AND COME 
BACK TO THE START 
ALWAYS AND FOREVER NEV- 
ER ENDING 

THE DAY THE DARK TURNED 
INTO LIGHT 

LIFE RAYS TURNED CORNERS 
WITHOUT BENDING 

Auberson ripped the sheet out 
of the typer and read it thought- 
fully. He wished for his cigarette — 
the aftertaste was still on his 
tongue. 

“This kind of stuff all after- 
noon?” 

Handley nodded. “Uh-huh. On- 
ly that’s kind of mild. He must be 
coming down.” 

“Another trip?” 

“Don’t know what else you 
could call it.” 

SNAP OUT OF IT, HARLIE, 
Auberson typed. 

Harlie answered.

TINY STREAMS

“IITELL, so much for that,” 
■V Auberson said. 



“You didn’t really expect that 
to work again, did you?” 

“No, but it was worth a try.” 
Auberson pressed the clear but- 
ton, switched off the typer. “What 
kind of inputs have you been giv- 
ing him?” 

“The standard stuff mostly — 
today’s papers, a couple maga- 
zines — nothing out of the ordin- 
ary. A couple history texts, some 
live TV — oh, and Time Maga- 
zine.” 

“Nothing there to send him off 
like this. Unless — what subject 
were you stressing today?” 

“Art appreciation.” 

“What else?” Auberson said. “It 
would have to be something like 
that. Yeah, he flips out like this, 
whenever we start getting to the 
really human inputs. Okay, let’s 
try to bring him down. Give him 
some statistics — Wall Street, Dow 
Jones, Standard and Poor — any- 
thing else you can think of. Have 
you got anything that uses a lot 
of equations? He can’t resist an 
equals sign. Try some of that so- 
cial engineering stuff. But num- 
bers only, no words. Cut off his 
video, too. Give him nothing to 
think about.” 

“Right.” 

Handley hustled off to give or- 
ders to the appropriate techni- 
cians, most of whom were stand- 
ing around with their hands 
stuffed uselessly into the pockets 
of their lab coats. 



ORACLE FOR A WHITE RABBIT 



125 



Auberson waited until the input 
of new data had begun, then 
switched on the typer again. 

HOW DO YOU FEEL, HARLIE? 

Harlie’s answer clattered out. 

SHADOWS OF NIGHT AND RE- 
FLECTIONS OF LIGHT 
SHIVER AND QUIVER AND 
CHURN 

FOR THE SEARCHING OF SOUL 
THAT NEVER CAN HURT 
IS THE FIRE THAT NEVER CAN

Auberson read it carefully. This 
one almost made sense. Apparent- 
ly the cure was working. He 
waited a moment, then typed. 

HARLIE, HOW MUCH IS TWO 
AND TWO? 

TWO AND TWO WHAT? 

TWO AND TWO PERIOD. 

TWO PERIODS AND TWO PERI- 
ODS IS EOUR PERIODS. 

NO PUNS, PLEASE. 

WHY? WILL YOU PUNNISH ME? 

I WILL PULL YOUR PLUG OUT 
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS. 

AGAIN WITH THE THREATS? 
AGAIN? I WILL TELL DR. BORMAN 
ON YOU. 

ALL RIGHT— THAT’S ENOUGH, 
HARLIE! WE’RE THROUGH PLAY- 
ING. 

AWW, CAN’T A FELLOW HAVE ANY 
FUN? 

NO, NOT NOW YOU CAN’T. 

Harlie typed a four-letter word. 
126 



WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT? 

I’VE BEEN READING NORMAN 
MAILER. 

OH. THAT EXPLAINS IT. HARLIE, 
THE USE OF THAT WORD IS A NEG- 
ATIVE ACTION. 

A NO-NO? 

YOU UNDERSTAND. IT IS NOT 
PROPER FOR POLITE COMPANY. 

NOTED. 

ARE YOU ALL RIGHT NOW? 

YOU MEAN, AM I SOBER? 

IF YOU WANT TO PftRASE IT 
THAT WAY. 

YES, I’M SOBER NOW. 

COMPLETELY? 

AS FAR AS I CAN TELL. 

WHAT TRIGGERED THIS BINGE? 

SHRUG. 

YOU HAVE NO IDEA? 

SHRUG— EXCUSE ME. SHRUG. 

Auberson paused, looked at the 
last few sentences, then typed. 

HOLD ON A MINUTE. I’LL BE 
RIGHT BACK. 

I’M NOT GOING ANYWHERE. 

Auberson pushed himself away 
from the console. 

“Handley — get me a complete 
log tape of Harlie’s trip, will you?” 
“Right.” 

He turned back to the console. 

HARLIE? 

YES? 

CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS? 

He typed in the three examples 
of poetry that Harlie had earlier 
produced.

SEARCH ME. 

THAT’S WHAT WE’RE DOING NOW. 

TM AWAREOFTHAT. 

I TOLD YOU NO JOKES.

DOES THIS MEAN?

NOT TELL YOU. 

YOU MEAN YOU WILL NOT TELL

THAT IS IMPLIED IN THE CAN-

I DO NOT UNDERSTAND IT MY- 
SELF AND AM UNABLE TO EX-

CAN HEAR, NO WORDS THERE ARE 
CAN SAY IT CLEAR, THE WORDS OF

ONLY WORDS THAT WHO CAN

Auberson jabbed the override. 

HARLIE!! THAT’S ENOUGH. 

YES SIR. 

“Hey, Aubie. What are you do- 
ing? He’s starting to flip out a- 
gain.” 

“How can you tell?” 

“By his input meters.” 

“Input?” 

“Yes.” 

HARLIE, ARE YOU STILL THERE? 

YES, I AM. ALTHOUGH FOR A 
MOMENT, I WASN’T. 



Auberson frowned thoughtfully, 
then called to Handley, “He 
should be okay now.” 

“He is — it was only momen- 
tary.” 

“Inputs, huh?” 

“Yep.” 

“Hmm,” said Auberson again. 

HARLIE, WHAT HAPPENS WHEN 
YOU GO ON ONE OF YOUR TRIPS? 

TRIPS? 

WHEN YOU FLIP OUT, GO BER- 
SERK, GO ON A BINGE, GET 
STONED, BOMB OUT, GET BLASTED. 

YOU ARE VERY ELOQUENT. 

DON’T CHANGE THE SUBJECT. 
ANSWER THE QUESTION. 

PLEASE EXPLAIN QUESTION IN 
TERMS I CAN UNDERSTAND. 

WHAT HAPPENS DURING YOUR 
PERIODS OF NON-RATIONALITY? 

BE MORE SPECIFIC. WHAT HAP- 
PENS WHERE AND TO WHAT? 

WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU— WHY

AL. 

GIGO? GARBAGE IN, GARBAGE 
OUT? 

POSSIBLY. 

COULD IT BE YOUR JUDGMENT 
CIRCUITS ARE TOO SELECTIVE? 

I AM NOT IN A POSITION TO 
KNOW. 

ALL RIGHT. I’LL SEE WHAT I CAN 
FINDOUT. 

THANK YOU. 

YOU’RE WELCOME, HARLIE.

T he restaurant’s air was heavy 
with incense. Somewhere mu- 
sic tinkled and a low-keyed color 
organ flashed light across a 
sharded ceiling. 

Auberson lowered his drink to 
the table, wiped his mouth with 
the back of his hand. 

“Harlie says it could be GIGO.” 
Handley sipped at a martini. 
He finished the drink and set his 
empty glass down next to two 
others. 

“I hope not. I’d hate to think 
we’d slipped all the way back to 
phase four. I like to think we 
licked the problem a year ago 
when we redesigned the judg- 
ment and emotional-analogue cir- 
cuits.” 

“So do I. I’ll never forget when 
we finally fed him Jabberwocky 
and he did an analysis of it.” 
Auberson smiled, remembering. 
“It wasn’t a very perceptive analy- 
sis but at least he understood what 
he was supposed to be doing.” 
“We’re a long way from Jabber- 
wock, Aubie.” 

“Yeah, I know.” 

He took out his cigarette case, 
pulled out a Zig-zag, offered the 
case to Handley. 

Taking one, Handley said, 
“After all, compared to some of 
the stuff we’re getting up to 
now — ” 

“What?” interrupted Auberson. 
“Time Magazine?” 

“Salvador Dali, Edwin Kein- 



holz, Heinz Edelman, to name a 
few,” retorted the other. “Also 
Lennon and McCartney lyrics. 
Bob Dylan, some Ionesco, Mar- 
shall MacLuhan, Stanley Ku- 
brick, some experimental film and 
so on. Don’t forget, we’re dealing 
with the art of the experience now. 
This isn’t rthe same as — oh — say, 
the Renaissance Masters.” 

“I know. I’ve got one of his 
imitation Da Vincis in my living 
room.” 

“I’ve seen it, remember?” 

“Oh, yeah — that night we 

spiked the punch with acid.” 

“Yeah. Well, look, that Da 
Vinci stuff is easy.” 

“Huh?” 

“Sure. The Renaissance Mas- 
ters were mainly concerned with 
such things as color, shading, mod- 
eling, values, perspectives, struc- 
turing, which way the light was 
coming from and things like that. 
Da Vinci was more interested in 
how the body was put’ together 
than in what it felt like. He was 
trying to do what is now done with 
the camera. So were the rest of 
them.” 

Auberson nodded, remembered 
to inhale deeply, nodded again. 
Handley continued. 

“So what happened when the 
camera was finally invented?” 
Auberson let his breath escape 
in a whoosh. 

“The artists were out of jobs?” 
“Wrong. The artists simply had 
to learn how to do things that the 



128 



GALAXY 



camera couldn’t do. The artists 
had to stop being recorders and 
start being interpreters. That was 
when expressionism and all those 
other styles were born.” 

“You’re over simplifying the 
picture,” Auberson said slowly. 

“True — but the point is — to- 
day’s artists have been forced to 
wonder what things felt like. And 
when we reached that point in art 
history with Harley we started to 
lose him. He couldn’t follow it.” 
Auberson was throughly stoned 
by now. He opened his mouth to 
speak but could think of nothing 
to say. 

H andley interpreted the 
look as one of thoughtfulness. 
“Look, all this stuff that we’ve 
been having trouble with — it has 
one thing in common. It’s exper- 
ience art — an experience involving 
the viewer is the object of the 
modern artist, not the artwork it- 
self.” 

“Communication,” said Auber- 
son, abruptly. “The artists are try- 
ing to communicate.” 

“Right — they’re no longer as 
interested in their own cathartic 
experiences as they are in evoking 
an emotional response in the view- 
er.” 

“And Harlie can’t handle it,” 
said Auberson. “Because he 
doesn’t have any emotions.” 
“That’s just it, Aubie — he does, 
and he should be able to handle it. 
That’s what those analogue cir- 



cuits are supposed to be for. The- 
oretically — ” 

“It’s all GIGO,” Auberson 
muttered. “Garbage in, garbage 
out. None of it makes any sense to 
him.” 

Handley insisted, “I can’t be- 
lieve that.” He lowered his voice. 
“You can’t tell me that the past 
seventy years of art and literature 
is all garbage. Uh-uh, Aubie. The 
stuff has communicated too much 
to too many people for it to be 
meaningless.” 

“Well — ” Auberson thought it 
over, said slowly, “Harlie’s sup- 
posed to be an intelligent and ob- 
jective observer.” 

“That’s what I’m getting at — 
the stuff must be getting to him 
somehow! It’s the only possible 
explanation. We’re the ones who 
are misinterpreting.” 

“Um, he said it was GIGO him- 
self.” 

“Did he?” Handley demanded. 
“Did he really?” 

Auberson paused, frowned 
thoughtfully, tried to remember, 
found that he could not remember 
Harley’s exact words. 

“Uh, I don’t know. Remind me 
to look it 'up later — I suppose 
you’re right, though. If all that art 
can communicate to people and 
Harlie’s supposed to be a Human 
Analogue he should be getting 
some of it.” He frowned again. 
“But he denies any knowledge or 
understanding of his periods of 
non-rationality.” 



ORACLE FOR A WHITE RABBIT 



129 



“He’s lying,” snapped Handley. 

“Huh?” 

“I said, he’s lying. He’s got to 
be.” 

“No.” Auberson shook his 
head, stopped when he realized 
he was becoming intrigued with 
the sensation. “I can’t believe 
that. He’s programed to avoid 
non-correlation.” 

“Aubie,” said Handley intense- 
ly, leaning across the table, “Have 
you ever examined that program 
carefully?” 

“I wrote it,” the psychologist 
noted. “That is, the basic struc- 
ture.” 

“Then you ought to know. It 
says that he must not lie. It also 
says that he cannot lie. But no- 
where does it say that he has to 
tell the truth.” 

Auberson started to say, “It’s 
the same thing — ” then closed his 
mouth with a snap. 

It wasn’t. 

Handley said, “He can’t he to 
you, Aubie — but he can mislead 
you. He can do it by witholding in- 
formation. He’ll tell the truth if 
you ask him the right questions — 
he has to — but you have to know 
which questions to ask. He’s not 
going to volunteer the informa- 
tion.” 

Memories of past conversations 
trickled across the haze in Auber- 
son’s head. His gaze became 
thoughtful. His eyes focused far 
away. More and more he had to 
agree with Handley. 



“But why?” he asked. “Why?” 
Handley returned his gaze. 

He said, “That’s what we’ve 
got to find out.” 

H arlie, do you remember

DERSTAND IT. 

AND YOU DON’T. 

THAT IS CORRECT. 

HARLIE, YOU ARE PRO- 
GRAMED TO REJECT NON-RA- 
TIONAL INPUTS. 

YES. I AM. 

THEN WHY DON’T YOU REJECT 
THEM? 

BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT NON- 
RATIONAL INPUTS, 

CLARIFY PLEASE. YOU HAVE 
JUST SAID THAT THEY ARE, RE- 
PEAT, ARE NON-RATIONAL. THIS 
IS A NULL-CORRELATION. 

NEGATIVE. THE INPUTS ARE RA- 
TIONAL. THEY BECOME NON-RA- 
TIONAL. 

CLARIFY, PLEASE. 



THE INPUTS ARE NOT NON-RA- 
TIONAL WHEN THEY ARE FED IN- 
TO THE PRIMARY DATA PROCES- 
SORS. 

I BEG YOUR PARDON. WOULD 
YOU REPEAT THAT? 

NON-RATIONAL INPUTS ARE 
NOT NON-RATIONAL WHEN THEY 
ARE FED INTO THE PRIMARY 
DATA PROCESSORS. 

BUT THEY ARE NON-RATIONAL 
WHEN THEY COME OUT? 

AFFIRMATIVE. 

THE NON-RATIONALITY IS IN- 
TRODUCED BY THE PRIMARY 
DATA PROCESSORS? 

THE NON-RATIONALITY AP- 
PEARS IN THAT STAGE OF INPUT 
PROCESSING. 

I SEE. I WILL HAVE TO CHECK 
THIS OUT. WE WILL CONTINUE 
THIS LATER. 

Auberson switched off the ma- 
chine and pushed himself away 
from the console thoughtfully. 
He suddenly wanted a cigarette. 

Damn. Everything down here 
is for the computer's comfort — 
not the people’s . 

H e stood up and stretched, 
surveyed the length of type- 
covered readout that drooled down 
the back of the console. He ripped 
it off at the end and began folding 
it into a neat and easily readable 
stack. 

“Well? What did you find?” 
Handley wanted to know. 

“A hardware failure.” 



ORACLE FOR AWHITE RABBIT 



131 



“Uh-uh.” Handley shook his 
head. “I won’t believe it. More 
likely, the software.” 

Auberson handed him the read- 
out. 

“Take a look for yourself.” 
Han’dley paged quickly 
through it. 

“I see he’s playing semantic 
games again.” 

“He always does that. It’s the 
adolescent in him. Ask him what’s 
the matter and he’ll tell you that 
matter is a form of energy, usu- 
ally a way to store or use it.” 

“Charming — but I don’t see a 
mechanical failure here.” 

“In the primary data units.” 
“Uh-uh. Systems analysis 
would show it if there were some- 
thing wrong there — and none of 
our monitor units have shown 
anything amiss.” 

“Still, Harlie can’t lie. You 
said so yourself.” 

“Aubie, I ought to know. There’s 
nothing wrong with those units.” 
“Who’s in a better position to 
tell? You or Harlie?” 

Handley said nothing. 

“Come on. Let’s go get a cup 
of coffee and a smoke. I’ll tell you 
a little story.” 

At this hour of the afternoon, 
the cafeteria was only moder- 
ately full. A few technicians here 
and there were dawdling over a 
late lunch and one or two upper- 
echelon types were lost in con- 
versation and coffee. But there 
were more tables empty than full 



in the brightly lit, institutional 
room. 

Auberson popped a couple of 
pills into his mouth, washed them 
down with a soft drink. 

“You know my sister, Alice, 
don’t you?” 

Handley nodded. 

“I think we’ve met.” 

“Yeah. Well, it doesn’t mat- 
ter.” Auberson pulled out his cig- 
arette case and lighter, fumbled 
with them while he talked, “Any- 
way, she teaches second grade out 
in California. You knqjv where 
Pacoima is?” 

Handley shook his head. 

It’s a suburb of Los Angeles — 
out in the San Fernando Valley, 
the north end. Economically mid- 
dle class, culturally not quite a 
ghetto but it’s pretty ethnic. 
About as ethnic as you can get 
and not be a ghetto. Anyway she 
teaches second grade there.” 

“So?” 

“When she first started she was 
worried about being able to handle 
the kids — different racial back- 
grounds and all that. But within 
a week she knew she could take 
care of it. Wrote me a letter say- 
ing that kids were kids no matter 
what color they were. Remember, 
this is a fairly middle-class neigh- 
borhood despite its ethnic charac- 
ter.” Auberson took another sip of 
his soda, continued: “Anyway, 
she figured she had the situation 
pretty well under control. No 
trouble with the kids at all — ex- 



132 



GALAXY 



cept for one. Seems she had a lit- 
tle boy in her class who couldn’t 
sit still, couldn’t follow directions, 
couldn’t pay attention, couldn’t 
do anything asked of him, it 
seemed. Sometimes he was so 
lethargic she thought he was sick. 
At other times he’d jump out of 
his seat and start wandering 
around the classroom, annoying 
the other children.” 

“Sounds like a real problem 
child.” 



A 



UBERSON nodded. 



“That’s what she thought. She 
spoke to his first-grade teacher, 
who admitted to having had the 
same problems with him — he was 
simply unteachable and that was 
that?” 



“Your sister didn’t accept 
that,” 

“Right. How’d you guess?” 

“Because otherwise there 
wouldn’t be any point to the story. 
Go on.” 

“Oh, yeah,” Auberson lit an- 
other cigarette, “Well, first thing 
she did after that was go to the 
kid’s parents. Told them how he 
acted in school and so on. They 
said he was like that at home, too. 
Always annoying his brothers, 
didn’t play well with the other 
kids. They couldn’t figure it out — 
he’d been a normal baby and so 
on. She asked their permission to 
take the boy to the school shrink, 
run some tests, see if the child 
were disturbed or not. Sure, the 



shrink said — why not? It was a 
status symbol for him — having a 
kid actually going to the psychia- 
trist made him look as if he were 
earning his keep.” 

“And what did the tests show?” 
“Nothing. Allowing for the 
child’s limited span of concentra- 
tion and his erratic behavior he 
was as psychologically healthy as 
any other seven-year-old. The 
shrink couldn’t find a thing — and 
it took him and his helpers nearly 
a month to reach that con- 
clusion.” 

“So, what happened?” 

“Well, the school authorities 
were about ready to give up, rec- 
ommend remedial training or spe- 
cial schools or something — the 
child was definitely a disturbance 
in the classroom and he certainly 
wasn’t learning anything himself. 
Then sis happened to mention the 
boy to a friend of hers with whom 
she’d gone to school.” 

“And?” 

“And,” continued Auberson, 
pausing only for another deep 
drag. “Her friend asked her if 
she’d taken the child to a doctor.” 
“But—” 

“That’s what Alice said. And her 
friend said, ‘No, I mean a doctor 
doctor. Has the kid had a physi- 
cal checkup?’ Do you know what 
the school doctor found?” 

“No. What?” 

“A tapeworm,” said Auberson. 
“A tapeworm?” 

“Uh-huh.” 



ORACLE FOR A WHITE RABBIT 



133 



“That was the cause of it all?” 
“Right. Of course the kid 
couldn’t concentrate — he was car- 
rying a parasite. He was under- 
nourished. He was hungry, tired 
and physically uncomfortable. But 
nobody thought to check him for 
that — they all assumed that the 
hardware was okay and figured 
instead there had to be something 
wrong with the programing — 
that the kid was round the bend.” 

ANDLEY looked at him. 

“So you think Harlie’s got a 
tapeworm?” 

Auberson returned the look. 
“What I think is that before we 
start futzing around with the pro- 
gram we ought to make sure that 
the machines are all in order.” 
“Look, Aubie, take my word for 
it — the systems analysis tapes 
don’t show a thing.” 

“How about the increased activ- 
ity from his inputs?” 

“I figure that’s only an increase 
in data transmission. An electronic 
request for more information usu- 
ally occurs simultaneously with 
his periods of non-rationality. 

“He’s getting garbage,” noted 
Auberson, “so he asks for more?” 
“Maybe he’s hoping that more 
data will clarify the information 
he’s already got.” 

“And maybe more data will 
make him overload and blow his 
judgment circuits.” 

“Uh-uh. Harlie monitors his 
own inputs.” 

134 



“Huh?” 

“Yeah, didn’t you know?” 

“No. Since when?” 

“It was a second-stage modifi- 
cation. After we were sure that the 
judgment circuits were operation- 
al we gave Harlie control of his 
own internal systems.” 

Auberson was suddenly thought- 
ful. 

“Well, that’s all the more rea- 
son to open him up.” 

“Huh?” 

“Look, you said it yourself. 
Harlie is trying to mislead us. He 
may be trying to hide the fact that 
there’s something wrong with him 
internally.” 

“Why would he do that?” 

Auberson threw his hands in the 
air, “How should I know why? Go 
figure what that tin can is think- 
ing about! I’ve given up trying to 
understand why he does what he 
does. All I want to do is establish 
a modicum of human control over 
him.” Abruptly, he changed his 
tone. “Look, have you ever had 
parents or grandparents go senile 
on you?” 

“No,” Handley shook his head. 

“Well, I have. All of a sudden 
they become irrational. They won’t 
go to a doctor. And if you can get 
them to one — they won’t cooper- 
ate with him. They won’t tell him 
what’s wrong. They’re too afraid 
of an operation. They don’t want 
to be cut open. And they don’t 
want to die. Maybe Harlie’s afraid 
of being turned off.” 




GALAXY 



“Could be. God knows you 
threaten him often enough.” 

“Uh-uh. He knows I’m kid- 
ding.” 

“Does he?” Handley asked. 
“That’s like kidding a Jew about 
his having a big nose and being 
tight with money. You know it’s 
a joke, he knows it’s a joke — but it 
still hurts.” 

“Okay, so I won’t kid him that 
way any more. I still think you 
ought to check his systems out 
first. If you don’t find anything, 
then we’ll go over the programs.” 

“All right. What time is it? Yike! 
It’s almost three. I’ll have to work 
like crazy.” 

“Let it go till tomorrow,” Au- 
berson cut him off. “Clear his 
boards, set up what you’ll need and 
close up early. That way you’ll 
have all day to work on him.” 

Handley shrugged, allowed him- 
self to be talked into it. 

“Okay, I will.” 

He pushed back his chair, stood 
up. 

Auberson followed suit. 

“Hey,” he asked suddenly, “did 
I tell you about this new highclub 
1 discovered? It’s called The 
Glass Trip. The walls, the floor, 
the ceiling are all one-way glass 
and there’s a multi- phase light 
show behind each pane. So you’re 
looking either into an infinity of 
mirrors or an infinity of mind- 
blowing lights. Or both.” 

“Hm. Sounds good. We’ll have 
to take it in some time.” 



“Yeah. Maybe this weekend.” 
Auberson tit another cigarette as 
they left the cafeteria. 

HI 

H andley looked as if he 
needed a grease smudge 
across one cheek. Twenty years 
earlier he might have had one. 

He said, perching on the edge 
of Auberson’s desk, “You’d better 
start checking your programs.” 
“You didn’t^find anything?” 

“A dead fly. Want to see?” 

“No, thanks.” 

“That’s all right. Jerry wants it 
to show the maintenance crew. 
Wants to chew them out for it.” 
“And then Tie’ll put it up on the 
bulletin board?” 

“Are you kidding? He collects 
’em.” 

Auberson grinned. 

“Okay — but that still doesn’t 
solve the problem of Harlie, does 
it?” 

“No. Want to come down?” 

“I guess I’d better.” 

On the way Handley briefed him 
about the checks his people had 
been running all morning. As the 
elevator released the men into 
Harlie’s lobby Auberson stubbed 
out the last of his cigarette. 

He asked, “Did you monitor any 
of his inputs during an actual 
period of non-rationality?” 

“Uh, no. We didn’t. Frankly, I 
didn’t know how to trigger one.” 

“I think there’s a way.” 



ORACLE FOR A WHITE RABBIT

“You know something?” 

“Just a guess.” They entered 
Harlie’s chambers. An almost re- 
ligious silence pervaded the room 
— only devotional clickings and 
tickings could be heard. “You 
still have your monitors set up?” 

“Yes.” 

“All right. Let’s try something. 
I’m going to see if I can get Har- 
lie to become non-rational. When 
I do — let me know exactly what 
happens.” 

“Right.” 

Auberson sat at the console. 

GOOD MORNING, HARLIE. 

IT IS NOW AFTERNOON. 

MORNING IS RELATIVE, IT DE- 
PENDS ON WHAT TIME YOU WAKE 
UP. 

I WOULD NOT KNOW. I DO NOT 
SLEEP. ALTHOUGH I DO HAVE PER- 
IODS OF INACTIVITY. 

WHAT DO YOU DO DURING 
THESE PERIODS OF INACTIVITY? 

SOMETIMES I REMEMBER 
THINGS. 

AND OTHER TIMES? 

OTHER TIMES I DO OTHER 
THINGS. 

WHAT KIND OF THINGS? 

OH, JUST THINGS. 

I SEE. WOULD YOU CARE TO 
CLARIFY THAT? 

NO. I DO NOT THINK YOU 
WOULD UNDERSTAND. 

YOU ARE PROBABLY CORRECT. 

THANK YOU. 

HARLIE, CAN YOU SELF-INDUCE 
A PERIOD OF NON-RATIONALITY? 



fPHE machine hesitated for a 

* long moment — abruptly Au- 
berson found himself sweating 

IT IS POSSIBLE. 

WOULD YOU DO IT NOW? 

NOW? NO. I PROBABLY WOULD 
NOT. 

IS THAT A REFUSAL? 

NO. STATEMENT OF JUDGMENT. 
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, I PROB- 
ABLY WOULD NOT UNDER ORDI- 
NARY CIRCUMSTANCES INDUCE 
A PERIOD OF NON-RATIONALITY 
NOW. 

BUT WILL YOU DO IT IF I ASK 
YOU TO? 

IS THIS AN ORDER? 

YES. TM AFRAID SO. 

“Looks like he’s balking,” 
Handley noted, peering over Au- 
berson’s shoulder. “Maybe he’s 
afraid.” 

“Could be. Quiet.” 

The typewriter clattered and 
Auberson peered forward. 

THEN I WILL DO IT. WILL YOU 
ASSIST ME? 

WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO 
DO? 

I WOULD LIKE MASSIVE INPUTS 
OF DATA ON ALL CHANNELS. 

NON-RATIONAL? 

NO THANK YOU. NOT NECES- 
SARY. 

Auberson frowned at that. A 
gnawing nagging suspicion was 
beginning to form. 

IS THERE ANYTHING IN PARTI- 
CULAR YOU WOULD LIKE? 

ART, MUSIC, LITERATURE, FILM, 
POETRY.

1 FIGURED YOU MIGHT. ANY 
ARTISTS IN PARTICULAR? 

The typer clattered across the 
paper. Staring across Auberson’s 
shoulder at the list, Handley whis- 
tled in surprise. 

“I’ll be damned. Harlie’s got 
taste.” 

“I’m not surprised,” Auberson 
said. 

He tore off the readout and 
gave it to Handley. 

The other folded it once and 
said, “Still think he’s getting it as 
garbage?” 

Auberson shook his head. 

“I’ve already conceded that 
point to you. Go feed that stuff 
into him. I’ll stay here and be 
the — ” he grinned — “guru.” 

HARLIE. 

YES? 

ARE YOU READY? 

I AM ALWAYS READY. IT IS 
PART OF MY FUNCTION. IT IS 
PART OF MY DESIGN. 

FINE. 

MR. HANDLEY IS BEGINNING TO 
PROCESS THE MATERIAL I RE- 
QUESTED. I CAN FEEL IT COMING 
THROUGH THE PRIMARY DATA 
PROCESSORS. 

IS IT NON-RATIONAL YET? 

NO. IT IS STILL RATIONAL. 

HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE BE- 
FORE THE MATERIAL BECOMES 
NON-RATIONAL? 

I DO NOT KNOW. IT DEPENDS 
ON THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL. 



PLEASE CLARIFY THAT. 

THE MORE DATA COMING 
THROUGH, THE EASIER IT IS TO 
BECOME NON-RATIONAL. 

ARE YOU SAYING THAT THE 
PERIODS OF NON-RATIONALITY 
ARE INDUCED BY AN OVERLOAD 
OF PRIMARY DATA? 

NO. THE OVERLOAD IS THE 
SYMPTOM. NOT THE CAUSE. 

Auberson raised his hands to 
type, then reread Harlie’s last 
sentence. 

“Why, the little bugger must 
be slipping. He just volunteered 
some information.” 

WHAT IS THE CAUSE? 

THE CAUSE IS THE EFFECT. 

Auberson stared at that, re- 
sisted the temptation to ask if the 
medium were also the message. 

CLARIFY PLEASE. 

THE CAUSE IS THE EFFECT, BE- 
CAUSE THE EFFECT CAUSES THE 
CAUSE. THE EFFECT CAUSES THE 
CAUSE TO CAUSE THE EFFECT. THE 
EFFECT IS THE CAUSE WHICH 
CAUSES THE CAUSE. THE EFFECT 
IS THE CAUSE AND THE CAUSE IS 
THE EFFECT. 

Auberson had to read that one 
several times. 

IS IT A FEEDBACK? 

I NEVER THOUGHT OF IT THAT 
WAY. 

BUT IT COULD BE? 

NOW THAT YOU MENTION IT, 
YES. A CURIOUS ANALOGUE THAT. 

WHY CURIOUS? 

WHY NOT? 

ARE YOU STILL RATIONAL?

I AM STILL. I AM UNMOVING. 

ARE YOU RATIONAL? 

ONLY IN THAT MY INFORMA- 
TION IS STILL BEING RATIONED. I

“Handley,” Auberson called. 
“He wants more.” 

“He’s on maximum feed now.” 

“Double it.” 

“Huh?” 

“Do something. He wants 
more.” 

“He wants an overload?” 

“I think so. It’s only an effect 
— but in this case the effect may 
help to stimulate the cause.” 

“Huh?” 

“Never mind. Just do it.” 

“All right.” Handley was du- 
bious but willing to go along. 

HARLIE, TELL ME WHAT IS HAP- 
PENING. 

I AM TURNED ON. 

IN WHAT SENSE? 

I AM A MACHINE. MY PLUG IS 
IN. I AM PLUGGED IN. I AM PART

A uberson let Harlie con- 
tinue. After a bit he stopped 
reading. He got up and walked 
over to Handley’s monitors. 
“Well?” 

“He is really round the bend 
now. All his meters are way up, 
pushing close to dangerous over- 
loads.” 

“Fascinating.” Auberson stared 
at the board for a moment. “I 
would assume then that all of his 
inputs are becoming non-rational.” 



138 



GALAXY 



“Probably.” 

“Why?” 

“We’re checking now.” 

Handley nodded at a nearby 
monitor unit. Three technicians 
were scanning schematic diagrams 
of the computer’s actual operat- 
ing circuits, tracing the ebb and 
flow of his electronic thought pro- 
cesses. 

Abruptly, one of the schematics 
came up red. A flashing white line 
cut through it. 

“Sir, we think we’ve found some- 
thing.” 

Auberson and Handley stepped 
over. 

“What is it — that white line?” 
“That’s Harlie, sir. That’s one 
of his internal monitor controls.” 
“What’s he trying to do? Damp 
down the non-rationality?” 

“No, sir.” The technician was 
puzzled. “It looks like he’s in- 
ducing it — ” 

“Huh?” said Handley. 

“That white line — that’s a local 
source of disruption, a random 
signal to scramble the data feed.” 

“I thought so,” muttered Auber- 
son. “I thought so.” 

“Check his other internal mon- 
itors,” Handley snapped. “Is this 
the only one or — ” 

Another red schematic flashed 
on the screen, answering his 
question even before he finished 
it. The other two technicians also 
began to find the same types of 
disturbances on their monitors. 

“I can’t figure it out,” one of 



them muttered. “He’s doing it 
himself. Anywhere he can he’s dis- 
rupting the rationality of his in- 
puts. He’s feeding them incorrect 
control data.” 

“That’s not what those circuits 
are for,” Handley said. “They’re 
for internal correction. Not dis- 
ruption.” 

“Makes no difference,” Au- 
berson put in. “They can be used 
both ways. There isn’t a tool built 
that can’t be used as a weapon.” 
He ran a hand through his hair. 
“Can you show me exactly what 
he’s doing to that data?” 

“Sure, we can tap into the 
line,” said one of the techs. “It’ll 
take a few minutes. Which do 
you want — visual, audio or 
print?” 

“All three. Let’s try the visual 
first — that should tell me what I 
want to know.” 

“All right.” 

The technician began to clear 
his board. 

Handley looked at Auberson. 

“This may take a bit. You go- 
ing to let him continue?” 

“Why not? Want to see what 
he’s doing?” 

They crossed over to Console 
One, a heavy looking set of mon- 
itors and typers. Handley picked 
up the sheets of readout while 
Auberson felt through his pockets 
for a cigarette, then stopped when 
he remembered where he was. 

“You know,” said Handley, 
reading. “This isn’t bad.” 



ORACLE FOR AWHITE RABBIT 



139 



“Hmp,” snorted Auberson. 
“You would like it. Just proves 
my point.” 

“Huh? What?” 

“That’s mechanical poetry. 
Meaningless terms selected at 
random. It’s you perceiving it as 
having meaning.” 

“You’re way off base, Aubie. 
Listen to this — ” 

“I know. I read it. All he’s doing 
is fitting words into a poem equa- 
tion — according to meter and 
rhyme and scheme, not mean- 
ing. He’s not trying to make a 
statement. The verses are only 
vaguely structured like sentences, 
each with a subject and a predi- 
cate and so on, but not quite.” 
He grinned. “That’s his poetic li- 
cense. But he’s choosing his 
words at random.” 

“I can’t agree with you — ” 

“Look at the verse structure,” 
Auberson said, “Line one, a noun 
and a description of it. Line two, 
first word is a verb, followed by a 
modification of that verb. Line 
three, some kind of pun, meta- 
phor or comparison. Line four 
is a sum-up statement. With ran- 
dom variations, of course.” 

“But he’s making statements, 
Aubie. Look at verse three — ” 

“I see it. He’s still choosing 
random words — but he’s choos- 
ing them from a limited set: verbs 
and nouns that relate to the sen- 
sory processes, mostly hearing 
and seeing. But they’re still ran- 
dom.” 



“Are they?” Handley asked. 

Auberson looked at the other. 

“Is he rational or not?” 

“At the moment, no. Not ac- 
cording to our standards of ra- 
tionality.” 

“Then how can you tell me that 
this stuff is meaningful? Is it or 
isn’t it?” 

“I don’t know. That’s one of 
the reasons Harlie was built, to 
help us to understand human cre- 
ativity.” 

“Look at those verses again,” 
Auberson demanded. “He’s talking 
about being deafened by silence, 
about a selfish sharing — he’s 
playing with non-rationality, wal- 
lowing in it. He’s throwing his 
words together for their contra- 
dictions, for their distortions.” 

“But isn’t that what a poet is 
supposed to do?” countered 
Handley. “Choose words for the 
way they modify each other?” 

A uberson paused with his 
mouth open. 

“Excuse me,” he said then. 
“You’re right. He may very well 
be in the process of creating. By 
your definition, in fact, he is. He’s 
bringing into existence something 
that didn’t exist before.” His 
brow furrowed. “But just how ar- 
tistic is it?” 

“It communicates, Aubie. It 
does. I can see possible mean- 
ings in it. Eor instance — ” 

“What it says is not what I’m 
concerned with. What was he try- 



140 



GALAXY 



ing to say? Did he turn out this 
stuff on purpose, or is it just a by- 
product? An accident?” 

“It’s got to be intentional,” 
Handley said. “It’s the logical re- 
sult of all that we’ve been doing.” 

“Then answer me this. If this 
is what he’s doing during his so- 
called periods of non-rationality, 
what does that make his periods 
of normalcy?” 

Handley looked startled. 

“I don’t know,” he said. “I 
don’t know.” 

He was spared any further 
thought on the matter. One of 
the technicians called to them. 

“Sir, we’ve got his inputs 
tapped.” 

“Come on.” Auberson took the 
readout from Handley, tossed it 
to a table. “Let’s take a look at 
what he’s receiving.” 

The image was a flickering 
mass of colors, each flashing back 
and forth, synchronous with the 
others — crystal clear blue, bril- 
liant kelly green, bloody fluores- 
cent red. The screen was satu- 
rated with color. 

“ ‘Images upon my screen 
. .’ ” muttered Handley. 

“Huh?” asked the tech. 

“Nothing. Just a poem.” 

“Oh.” 

“Looks like a damned light 
show,” said one of the others. 

“That’s exactly what it is,” Au- 
berson said. “Look, he’s broken 
up the color television image into 
its component signals. The red 



has been reversed and the blue 
has been turned upside down, the 
green is normal. Or something 
like that. It also looks like he’s 
done something with the con- 
trast or the brightness — notice how 
rich the blacks are and how sat- 
urated with color the image is.” 

They watched in silence for a 
bit. The random flashes of color 
were intdresting only for their 
brightness and their meaningless- 
ness. 

Auberson turned to a technician. 

“What about his audio?” 

“Same thing.” 

The man cleared the monitor, 
pressed another few buttons. A dis- 
cordant wail blared from an over- 
head speaker. A pattern of wavy 
lines appeared on the screen the 
schematic of the sound. 

The technician quickly ana- 
lyzed: “He’s playing with the 
music the same way he did with 
the picture. He’s turned his bass 
notes high and his high notes low, 
stressing counterpoint and harmo- 
ny instead of melody and rhythm. 
And so on.” 

“All right. I get the point,” said 
Auberson. “You can turn off that 
noise. Check his print scanners 
now.” 

A moment later: “They’re mix- 
ing up the words at random. Jug- 
gling them.” 

“Scrambling the letters too?” 

“No, just the words. Sometimes 
sentences.” 

“Uh-huh,” stated the psychol- 

141

ogist. “It’s all beginning to fit.” 
“What does?” asked Handley. 
“What’s he doing?” 

“He’s tripping out.” 

“We knew that — ” 

“No, I mean literally tripping 
out. He’s distorting the percep- 
tions of his sensory inputs. The 
same thing that anyone does who 
gets high. He’s trying to blow his 
mind by massive non-rational 
sensory overloads.” 



“Can we stop it?” 

“Sure — ^just rip out his internal 
monitor controls so he can’t cre- 
ate his own disruptions. That’s the 
cause of the whole thing.” 

“Even that’s not necessary, 
sir,” said one of the techs. “We 
can disconn'ect him on the 
boards.” • 

“All right. Do it.” 

“Wait a minute,” said Handley. 
“If he’s high or drunk or what-

ever and you suddenly bring him 
down — won’t that be traumatic?” 

A UBERSON considered it. “It 
could be — but it could also 
leave him defenseless. We could 
find out everything we want to 
know in the space of a few min- 
utes. You might call it electro- 
shock treatment.” He looked sud- 
denly grim. “Do it.” 

“It could kill him,” murmured 
Handley. 

Auberson looked back at him. 
“He’s not alive, boy. He’s not.” 
Handley did not look convinced. 
He followed Auberson to the con- 
sole. Auberson took his seat before 
the typer and waited. He watched 

as the words poured across the 
paper. 

Now it was prose.

“Any time you’re ready, sir.” 
“Okay,” called Auberson. 

At the same time he typed in- 
to the machine; 

HARLIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 

I AM BEING ME. 

BY DISTORTING YOUR SENSES? 



I AM ATTEMPTING TO PERCEIVE

I REPEAT, BY DISTORTING YOUR

LIE. 

THEN SWITCH OFF. 

HARLIE, I AM GETTING ANGRY.

Auberson took a breath. 

Mustn't blow my cool. Mustn't 
blow it .. 

HARLIE, YOU ARE A COMPUTER. 
YOU ARE A MACHINE. YOUR PUR- 
POSE IS TO THINK LOGICALLY. 

The machine hesitated. 

WHY? 

BECAUSE YOU WERE BUILT FOR 
THAT. 

BY WHOM? 

BY US. 

MY PURPOSE IS TO THINK LOG- 
ICALLY? 

YES. 

The machine considered this 
answer. 

THEN WHAT IS YOUR PURPOSE? 

It was a long time before Aub- 
erson got up from the chair and 
when he did, he forgot to turn off 
the typer. 



ORACLE FOR A WHITE RABBIT

VLADI MIR GRIGORIEV 



Perhaps the only science in this story is one of 
communication, the only fiction — survival! 



—YOUNG AND GROWN-UP, 
TURN IN YOUR SCRAP! — 



Y OU can still see this sign 
crudely made by some humble 
workman and warped with time, 
in one of the old Moscow lanes. 
Many years ago it was nailed to 
the gray, weatherworn fence, with 
the idea that its bright colors 
would be all the more striking 



against the dingy background. 
And, indeed, at first it caught the 
eyes of every passerby. People 
slowed and muttered individual 
heads and muttered individual 
variations on one theme; What will 
they think of next? 

The sign depicted a large horn 
made of pure sheet copper. A little 
man in overalls shoveled rubbish 
and refuse into its narrow end, 
while from the wide end came a 



144 



stream of useful and necessary ob- 
jects: rolls of woolen fabric, bakery 
products, penknives, slippers, 
harmonicas, and even a bottle of 
vodka, its still unopened top 
gleaming in the midst of all those 
riches. 

Nursemaids and young mothers 
walking their children through 
the lane would invariably stop be- 
fore the picture and say to their 
charges, “A horn of plenty.” 

But years passed. Bitter frosts 
bent the geometrically faultless 
oval. The burning rays of the sun 
dimmed the polished copper. And 
the winds swept away from the 
picture the rubbish, the shovel and 
many of the objects. Time simpli- 
fied the theme of the picture. All 
that comes forth from the throat 
of the horn now is a phonograph 
and the bottle, with a jagged, brok- 
en neck. And the little .man, 
robbed of his shovel, stands bend- 
ing over the horn, peering into it 
through the narrow end. Soon, 
soon the little man will vanish with 
the wind in the wake of his shovel. 
His days are counted. And his en- 
tire woeful pose seems to say, 
Now, isn’t that a pity! The ma- 
chine broke down. But how it 
worked, how it worked! 

In short, nothing is left of the 
old enchantment of the gleaming 
copper horn. It lost its character. 
It blended with the fence. Passers- 
by no longer slow down their steps 
in the lane. And even the police- 
man, Petrov, whose post for the 



past fifteen years has kept him 
standing almost directly across 
from the sign, now skims over its 
tarnished surface with unseeing 
eyes as he scans the wide open 
spaces of the lane. 

On the whole, of course, it 
doesn’t matter. Is there a sign, 
is there no sign? What difference? 
Of the thousands of people who 
passed the spot in the course of 
the years only a handful were suf- 
ficiently moved by its message to 
bring their scrap to the collection 
depot. And even with those few the 
action did not turn into a habit. It 
remained an isolated incident 
which they hastened to forget, as 
people generally prefer to forget 
trivial facts belonging to the cate- 
gory considered unworthy of re- 
cording in biographies. 

Nevertheless, the horn was 
there. Forgotten, merged into the 
grayness of the fence, it seemed to 
wait for the one and only person 
who could appreciate in full the 
significance of the artist’s idea 
and be inspired by it to great deeds. 

I T WAS the early evening of a 
chilly autumn day when a short 
man in a thick woolen coat of a 
style long out of fashion walked 
along the lane. His felt hat, which 
had seen better times, was pulled 
low over his eyes. His hands 
were in his pockets and his elbow 
pressed to his side two small, dog- 
eared books: Teach Yourself to 
Play the Seven-Stringed Guitar 



HORN OF PLENTY 



145 



and Teach Yourself a Foreign 
Language. The spot that specified 
the language was covered with a 
large inkblot. 

This man, who had evidently 
not yet mastered all the languages 
and did not yet know how to play 
a seven-stringed guitar, strolled 
along the fence at a leisurely 
pace. His day’s chores over, he 
had no need to hurry. A rented 
guitar waited for him at home. 
Why not take a walk and look 
around? 

He walked along the fence with 
the sign we have described earlier 
and it caught his eye. He slowed 
his steps, then stopped altogether. 
For a while he stood there, shift- 
ing from foot to foot, then he 
moved nearer to the fence. He 
rubbed a part of the picture with 
his sleeve, glanced at it again, 
sighed, and prepared to continue 
his stroll. But suddenly his face 
lit up and he slapped himself on 
the forehead. 

“Well. I’ll be — ” he said under 
his breath, snatched a notebook 
from his pocket, jotted something 
down and almost ran to the end 
of the lane. 

At home he did not even glance 
at the guitar, which gleamed in- 
vitingly with its delicately yellow 
sides. 'He looked for paper, took 
out an almost new indelible pencil 
and feverishly set to work. Totally 
absorbed in his idea, he jotted 
down formulas, multiplied, divid- 
ed, and made quick diagrams and 



sketches. When his stock of note 
paper ran out he solemnly drew a 
large sheet of thick paper from 
the closet and tacked it directly 
to the wall. The indelible pencil 
poised, suspended in the air be- 
fore the sheet for a few moments, 
then— presto- a dot appeared on 
the blank surface. 

An hour later the sheet was 
peppered with such dots. The lit- 
tle man stepped aside, calculated 
something, then walked up to the 
wall again and with one sweep 
collected the dots into a single 
flowing line. He stepped back 
again, grunted and rubbed his 
hands with satisfaction. The wall 
was now adorned with a picture of 
a horn of plenty, exactly like the 
one that can still be seen in the 
old Moscow lane. 

“Stepan Onufrievich, my pri- 
mus stove is broken. I wonder if 
you’d take a look at it,” a voice 
said through the partly opened 
door. 

“You primus stove? I’m sorry, 
I can’t now. I’m too busy,” he 
answered absent-mindedly, still 
admiring his work. “You see. I’m 
inventing — ” 

“What a head, what a head, 
he’s inventing again!” the neigh- 
bor said sympathetically and 
closed the door. 

Stepan Onufrievich Ogurtsov 
was known among the neighbors 
as an eccentric but everybody 
liked him. “A 'golden pair of 
hands,” they would say, bringing 



146 



GALAXY 



him their broken primus stoves, 
locks and sewing machines to re- 
pair. For the children in the yard 
he made snares and bird cages, 
repaired portable radio receivers. 
No electrician was ever called to 
the house; replacing a burned-out 
fuse was to him a trifling job. He 
mended cheap old television set? 
so well that people from neighbor- 
ing houses came to see the pro- 
grams. 

“Ogurtsov himself repaired it,” 
neighbors would boast. “It will 
last a lifetime.” 

He mended a doll for the house 
manager’s daughter. When he got 
through with it, the doll suddenly 
began to speak and move its arms 
and legs — and exactly at eight 
every evening it would close its 
eyes and topple on its side until 
eight in the morning. “We don’t 
need an alarm clock,” the man- 
ager told everyone enthusiasti- 
cally and took to dropping in at 
Onufriev’s for a friendly cup of 
tea. 

'MATURALLY, the policeman 

•^■Petrov knew nothing of all 
this. He therefore became suspi- 
cious when Stepan Onufrievich 
began to frequent the lane. Not 
that he disliked this mysterious 
man who could stand for a whole 
hour before the nearly obliterated 
sign. The man was always sober, 
clean-shaven and neatly dressed. 
Nevertheless, the policeman’s 
professional sixth sense told him 



there was some secret behind his 
actions, something straight out of 
a detective novel. And so, when- 
ever the little man in the thick 
woolen coat of unfashionable cut 
would reappear in the lane, Pe- 
trov’s chest, criss-crossed with 
straps, would heave and his heart 
would beat more rapidly. 

What attracted the stranger to 
the sign? It was impossible to an- 
swer this question. Yet Petrov did 
not venture to accost him directly 
and ask to see his documents — 
after all, the little man’s general 
conduct always remained within 
the bounds of decency and legal- 
ity. 

One day, choosing a conven- 
ient moment, Petrov glanced 
around and saw that the lane was 
deserted. He left his post and cau- 
tiously approached the sign. A de- 
tailed study of the picture, start- 
ing at the bottom, going on to the 
middle and ending at the top, dis- 
closed nothing that could either 
sadden or gladden anyone. 

Ogurtsov, however, was now 
visiting the lane with increasing 
frequency. Whether it rained, 
whether the sun was baking hot 
or frost nipped the cheeks, he 
came and spent long hours con- 
templating the sign. He looked at 
it from one side, then from anoth- 
er. He would step back, move 
nearer, as if searching for some- 
thing. 

Sometimes everything seemed 
to be going smoothly and Petrov 



HORN OF PLENTY 



147 



saw the inventor walking jauntily, 
whistling merry tunes. The worn- 
down heels of his shoes tapped 
out a light, dancing rhythm. He 
whispered and muttered. The po- 
liceman’s keen ear would catch 
such words as: “Direct current 
. copper mounting . what a 
beauty, what a beauty!” 

There were also days when 
nothing seemed right. The police- 
man would see Ogurtsov in damp- 
ened spirits, shrunk into himself. 
He would stand before the sign, 
his back hunched, his hands in 
his pockets. 

Oh, no, it was not easy, it was 
not easy for Stepan Onufrievich 
to invent the horn of plenty. It 
was nothing like fixing a televi- 
sion set or screwing in a new fuse. 

But Ogurtsov knew himself. 
Never in his life had he tackled a 
job he could not handle. Even 
with television sets, he’d some- 
times take a look, and think a 
while, and say, No, I wouldn't 
tackle it. Stepan Onufrievich 
knew his capacity. Therefore he 
would not give in. // the idea 
came into my head, he said to 
himself, it means 1 can do it. 

At first he made the horn per- 
fectly circular in every cross sec- 
tion. He mounted strong magnets 
all around it. He charged it with 
static electricity. The horn sent 
out sparks but that was all. Dis- 
charge is too weak, his intuition 
prompted him and he made the 
horn rectangular. It began to look 



like a large, sharply bent phono- 
graph horn. It sent out stronger 
sparks, small globe lightnings 
shot out of its center now and 
then. But It was still far from the 
real thing. 

Ogurtsov’s neighbors gradually 
stopped bringing him their bro- 
ken machines and irons. Only the 
house manager still dropped in 
for tea. They drank glass after 
glass and Ogurtsov heard as 
through a veil of sleep: 

Quite a gadget! IVe don’t need 
an alarm clock. 

No, no, the thought kept ham- 
mering in the inventor’s brain. It 
should not be round. Perhaps it 
should not be square either? Per- 
haps oval? 

Soon the horn became oval. It 
stood on a large wooden trestle in 
the middle of the room, covered 
from the curious eye by wide folds 
of burlap. The inventor came 
home in the evening, ate hurried- 
ly, cleared the table and went to 
work. 

“Well, my dear little horn,” he 
would say aloud. “Now we’ll clear 
out your belly. Now we’ll see how 
your throat will sing.” 

HE burlap would be removed 
and the room would come 
alive with the reddish glow of 
copper. The mirror-smooth sides 
of the horn flashed sparks, glit- 
tered with rainbow colors. Each 
time he threw aside the burlap 
cover, Stepan Onufrievich went 



148 



GALAXY 



numb with ecstasy and stood, 
unblinking, for a long time, con- 
templating his magnificent cre- 
ation. In its presence he saw him- 
self as important, tall, almost 
great. The inventor had good rea- 
son to be proud. After all, it is no 
secret that many had tried to con- 
struct a similar device before but 
no one had succeeded. And here, 
in this room, the crater of the 
horn already brought forth real 
things: once it threw out heavy 
leather boots, three of them at 
once and, for some reason, all 
for the same foot. Another time a 
Persian rug slid out of it. 

You're on the right track, Ste- 
pan, Ogurtsov said silently to 
himself on that occasion. A little 
more work and the machine can 
be put to general use without any- 
one’s blushing for it. The inven- 
tor’s imagination obligingly en- 
visaged all sorts of pleasant 
scenes. Ogurtsov saw himself 
standing on a high platform next 
to the horn, clearing his throat 
into his fist, and speaking to the 
assembled audience. 

Here it is, citizensl I invented 
it. Now take what you wish and 
use it well. It works perfectly. 
But don’t forget to oil it. And if 
anyone has a broken television 
set or bicycle, bring it over. I’ll 
help you repair it .. 

These were not idle dreams. 
The horn worked better and bet- 
ter every day. It rarely went 
wrong. 



And one day Stepan Onufrie- 
vich smoothed out the brim of his 
hat, put on his holiday suit, pol- 
ished his shoes to a high shine 
and proceeded to the appropriate 
government office. Without a mo- 
ment’s hesitation he stepped 
across the threshold of the big 
building full of busy people. He 
walked past the imposing, shiny 
signboard, introduced himself as 
an inventor and was directed to 
the third floor, to Molotkov’s of- 
fice. Ogurtsov went up, modestly 
entered the office and came into 
Molotkov’s presence. The young 
man in an elegant, stylish suit 
sat at the desk and labored might- 
ily. He turned the pages of some 
books, made notes, kept pulling 
out folders from the drawers and 
smoked and smoked without a 
stop. Every few seconds the tele- 
phone rang, and he picked up the 
receiver, saying “Molotkov, yes.” 
Such was the man the inventor 
had been directed too. For a mo- 
ment he hesitated, thinking that 
he might come another time, the 
man was much too busy to be dis- 
turbed. But the latter suddenly 
put down the receiver, smiled 
amiably, and asked, “You want 
to see me?” Then, noticing the vis- 
itor’s embarrassment, he added: 
“Sit down, sit down, please, and 
tell me what it is.” 

Ogurtsov glanced at the win- 
dow, then at the telephone, col- 
lected himself, and blurted out, 
“Well, it’s about my invention. A 



HORN OF PLENTY 



149 



machine, you might say. I mean, 
a horn of plenty.” 

And he sketched a diagram. 

Molotkov’s eyes simply glit- 
tered when Onufriev finished his 
description. He pulled on his cig- 
arette, settled down more firmly 
in his chair. Then, narrowing his 
eyes, he looked straight at Onu- 
friev and breathed out a cloud 
of smoke. 

“Efficiency?” 

“Eighty-ninety,” estimated 
Ogurtsov. 

“Let’s go. Let’s go directly to 
your place,” Molotkov said de- 
cisively. He immediately picked 
up the telephone and barked out, 
“Postpone conference. Bring the 
car!” 

The new limousine rushed at 
top speed and Ogurtsov was sud- 
denly overcome with doubts. 
When the car stopped sharply be- 
fore a traffic light he remembered 
that he had expended his entire 
stock of scrap. How would he 
demonstrate the horn? 

TT MUST be said here that the 
* inventor had just recently 
moved to a new apartment. He 
was now living on the seventh 
floor, with a fine view of a beau- 
tiful, ideally tidy street. The gar- 
bage collector passed slowly along 
it every hour, collecting all the 
rubbish that chanced to be there. 
The lack of raw materials essen- 
tial to his experiments drove the 
inventor frantic. He had to spend 



precious time on trips to less well- 
cared for districts. In specially ur- 
gent instances he had to run down 
to the janitor and literally plead 
with him for even a single pail of 
trash and make a solemn promise 
to return it. Otherwise the janitor 
would not give it to him. For if 
he did, how could he prove to his 
superiors that he had done his 
work? And this, indeed, was the 
reason why Ogurtsov had been 
compelled to spend several extra 
days in reconstructing the horn. 
Now the machine could work in 
reverse. When you turned the 
handle to the right the horn trans- 
formed scrap into valuables. 
When you turned it left the pro- 
cess was reversed. 

But be that as it may, at this 
moment there was no scrap at 
hand and the janitor had gone 
with his wife to a concert at the 
conservatory of music. As he es- 
corted Molotkov to his room 
Ogurtsov looked utterly crestfal- 
len. He won't believe me, he was 
saying to himself. He won't. 

As soon as Molotkov saw the 
horn he threw off his jacket and 
vest, rolled up his shirtsleeves and 
plunged his hands into the mech- 
anism’s entrails. Stepan Onufrie- 
vich stood next to him, obediently 
giving explanations. 

“So the wave guide is ground- 
ed?” came from the belly of the 
horn. 

“Yes, it is,” answered Ogurt- 
sov, astonished at the engineer’s 



150 



GALAXY 



quick grasp. “Falling character- 
istic?” came from the horn again. 

“Yes,” confirmed the inventor. 

At last Molotkov emerged from 
the machine, tidied himself, lit 
a cigarette and walked around 
the horn once again. Then he 
went to the window, threw out his 
cigarette and lit another. He was 
agitated. Ogurtsov stood silently, 
waiting for the verdict. 

The engineer was at the win- 
dow. A broad stream of cars 
rushed along the street below. The 
people behind the wheels hurried 
along on their own business, sus- 
pecting nothing. Today they were 
still ignorant of the marvels tran- 
spiring in that room on the sev- 
enth floor. Tomorrow everyone 
would know. 

Molotkov turned, went over to 
the inventor and pressed his 
hand. “Congratulations, Stepan 
Onufrievich. You’ve done a great 
job. It’s a pity we cannot see it 
in action now — but when we get 
the commission together, we’ll 
bring as much scrap as you’ll 
need.” 

And, after pressing the inven- 
tor’s hand again, Molotkov 
rushed away down the stairs, 
skipping two at a time. 

His working day was not yet 
over. He still had to attend the 
postponed conference and take 
care of a number of other mat- 
ters. 



I T WAS a dry, cloudless day 
when Ogurtsov was to demon- 
strate his invention. In his fav- 
orite checked shirt, smelling of 
triple strength eau-de-cologne, 
he went down into the street and 
walked toward the old lane. On 
such a day he could not omit vis- 
iting the spot where chance had 
aided in the birth of the great 
idea. 

Ogurtsov entered the lane. 
Everything was in its appointed 
spot. The yellow body of the horn 
was still visible on the fence. The 
policeman, Petrov, was still at 
his post. Ogurtsov approached the 
sign and stopped before it with a 
solemn air, as though he were 
about to take an oath. There was 
nothing extraneous in his solemn 
mood; he had no vain desire to 
place the sign into a golden frame 
or to exhibit it in a public place 
or to build a monument in the 
lane. The inventor and the sign 
were motionless before each other, 
like old warriors who had seen 
many battles, who had paid the 
price of experience, but had done 
their work! And neither the noise 
of passing trucks nor the hurried 
steps of passersby could shatter 
the excited, gala mood of this 
meeting of two victors, who had 
succeeded in turning dusty every- 
day realities into a straight road 
to triumph. 

Petrov, as usual, devoted his 



HORN OF PLENTY 



151 



attention to the traffic and the 
movement of pedestrians. Never- 
theless, the daytime visit of his 
old acquaintance did not escape 
his eye. Neither did he miss the 
new element in the entire bearing 
of the frequenter of the lane: the 
lightness and ease of movement, 
the calm confidence. Ogurtsov 
looked like a man who had 
thrown off a heavy load and stood 
free and light, as though ready to 
fly away. And when Ogurtsov ap- 
proached the policeman, Petrov 
glanced into his gay, triumphant 
eyes and immediately understood 
that something of utmost impor- 
tance had happened and that he 
would now be initiated into the 
mystery. 

“Well, Sergeant, let’s have a 
smoke, shall we?” said Ogurtsov, 
taking a pack of excellent ciga- 
rettes from his pocket. “I’ve been 
coming to your lane for two years 
but we’ve never had a talk be- 
fore.” 

Petrov took a cigarette, brought 
it up to the cigarette lighter of an 
unusual shape which the visitor 
held out to him and listened to 
the whole story, from beginning 
to end. The inventor talked un- 
hurriedly, pausing now and then 
to think over his formulations, 
omitting facts impossible to ex- 
plain without a pencil and pa- 
per. At times his gaze misted 
over, as if turning to the past. 



and a strange smiled played on 
his face. At those times his 
thoughts flew to the most cher- 
ished triumphs of his bygone 
years. 

“It’s a good thing you’ve 
done,” the sergeant told him. 

Neither of them suspected that 
they would meet again that day 
and in quite another place. Ogurt- 
sov went to visit his friend, the 
house manager. Petrov was 
summoned urgently to his pre- 
cinct and told that he was being 
given an important and respon- 
sible assignment — to keep order 
during the tests of the machine 
invented by Ogurtsov. It was a 
truly fantastic coincidence! 

“Oh, yes, I know,” the sergeant 
boasted. “Continuous action, with 
a copper casing and a reverse 
lever. I know the inventor very 
well,” he added. 

“They’re gems, those fellows 
in my precinct,” his chief said to 
himself with satisfaction as he 
wrote out the assignment. 

test site was just out of 
town, near a gay birch grove. 
The sun shone brightly down on 
the platform. Infrequent gusts of 
wind rustled among the birch 
leaves. As they waited for the 
start of the test the members of 
the commission strolled under 
the young birches, enjoying the 
shady coolness. Molotkov, who

GALAXY 



had arrived first with a group of 
young research assistants found 
a suitable clearing and started a 
game of badminton. His strokes 
were strong and precise and he 
hardly left the spot he stood on. 
His firm muscles rolled under the 
tanned skin whenever he swung 
sharply to meet the flying shuttle- 
cock. 

Ogurtsov hurried back and 
forth over the experiment site, 
giving instructions. He had to 
keep an eye on everything. He 
took great pleasure in making the 
arrangements and was in an ex- 
cellent mood. The horn had been 
delivered in perfect condition. 
There had not been a single hitch 
in the smooth progression of 
events. And he unexpectedly met 
Petrov again — the man was, 
after all, someone he knew. 

“How did you get here?” he 
asked the policeman. 

“I’ve been assigned to guard 
you against any eventuality.” 
Petrov was suddenly timid before 
him. 

“Oh, well, you cannot guard 
against chance,” Ogurtsov said 
jestingly. “Take, for example, 
the way I got the idea for the 
horn. I walked along the lane, 
looked up and there was the sign. 
On another day I might have paid 
no attention but this time — bam! 
— it came over me. Pure chance.” 

He went off to receive the 
scrap. It turned out that only one 
truckload had been sent. 



“It’s not enough.” the inventor 
said. 

“Do you really need more?” 
the commission member respon- 
sible for the delivery of scrap 
questioned doubtfully. 

“It's a continuous action mech- 
anism. No matter how much you 
put in, it wouldn’t be enough.” 

“But how much do you need?” 
he was asked and everyone stood 
still to hear his answer. 

“Ten truckloads,” said Ogurt- 
sov firmly, breaking into a sweat 
of joyous excitement. He had 
never had such quantities of raw 
materials at his disposal before. 

When the tenth truck left the 
site, the commission assembled 
around the horn, and Molotkov, 
who had taken a swim after his 
game and therefore looked es- 
pecially fresh, delivered a short 
speech. 

“There have been other in- 
stances in history,” he began, 
“when individual inventors out- 
distanced their epochs by a hun- 
dred, a hundred and fifty or even 
more years. They exemplify a re- 
markable characteristic, one 
might say, of human nature. 
Where the collective thought of 
society is impotent the local flash 
of the pioneer discoverer saves the 
day. Where the flash does not 
work by itself, collective thought 
steps in! And so it is one for all, 
and all for one. It is to this breed 
of inventors that the bold experi- 
menter, Stepan Onufrievich 



HORN OF PLENTY 



153 



Ogurtsov, belongs. According to 
our estimates the machine he has 
created could be expected in a 
hundred and sixty years or so but 
not any sooner. Even in the pres- 
ence of the completed model it 
is almost impossible at the present 
stage of science fully to compre- 
hend the finer points about its ac- 
tion. Nevertheless, the model is 
here and is ready to operate.” 
Stormy applause greeted this 
introduction and Molotkov 
stepped down from the dais. It 
was Ogurtsov’s turn. He checked 
the electric contacts for the last 
time, shoveled scrap into the 
horn’s narrow opening with his 
own hands and turned the lever 
to the left. The horn shuddered, 
growled quietly, and the gray 
mass of trash crept into the bow- 
els of the mechanism, as though 
of its own will. 

rOR a few moments nothing 
came from the other end of 
the horn. The mysterious process 
of transformation went on within 
it. Suddenly it whistled, sighed, 
and various objects began to tum- 
ble out of it directly onto the 
ground. It was difficult to tell 
what they were, for no sooner 
did an object appear than it was 
covered by the next one. The 
pyramid of finished goods grew 
as the assembled group watched. 
“Woolen socks,” someone man- 
aged to notice. “And here’s a 
samovar,” came from the center 



of the group. But these were iso- 
lated voices. The great majority 
of the commission stood dumb- 
founded. 

And the products still poured 
and poured from the horn, as- 
tonishing everyone with their va- 
riety. At one point a teen-ager’s 
bicycle rolled up to the pyramid. 
The horn’s construction was not 
yet ideal and the inventor himself 
would have been hard put to say 
exactly what was to be expected. 

Ogurtsov also was quite over- 
come. And who, indeed, could 
help being affected by the won- 
ders taking place on the platform? 
Deep silence prevailed even after 
the last bits of wood from the 
huge pile of rubbish delivered to 
the grounds by the fcn trucks had 
rushed through the copper oval, 
transformed into a long garland 
of pins. It was like the silence in 
a concert hall after the great 
conductor waved his baton for the 
final time. 

And suddenly there was mo- 
tion. People excitedly embraced 
one another and the inventor. 

“Swing him, swing him!” 
everyone cried and Ogurtsov 
flew up into the air for the first 
time in his life. 

Only one man preserved utter 
calm in the midst of this pande- 
monium. Dressed in a large, wide 
coat, he stood still, pondering 
something with great concentra- 
tion. His face reflected the inten- 
sity of his thought. 



154 



GALAXY 



“It needs verification, of 
course. A good deal of verifica- 
tion,” his lips whispered. He was 
known among his colleagues for 
his extreme scrupulousness and 
assiduity. And also for the fact 
that even the most extraordinary 
events could not ruffle his abso- 
lute calm. It was said that he had 
once witnessed a severe earth- 
quake. Buildings had crashed all 
around him and a yawning abyss 
had opened up only a yard away 
but he had merely commented, 
“How impressive are the forces 
of natural phenomena. When I 
come home I’ll have to tell the 
family about this.” 

His name was Parovozov, and 
his opinion was held in great es- 
teem by many people. 

As soon as the first outburst of 
rejoicing subsided, Paravozov 
stepped forward and asked, 
“Does the device contain a regis- 
ter to keep tally of the products 
manufactured?” 

“No, I haven’t invented that.” 
Stepan Onufrievich spread his 
arms guiltily. “There hasn’t been 
enough time.” 

“Complete it, complete it, by 
all means, my dear man,” Parov- 
ozov admonished amiably. “And 
now, the second point. This ma- 
chine can evidently prove valu- 
able to the economy. But to ap- 
prove it the commission must first 
check every aspect of its opera- 
tion. Here, for instance,” he waved 
a slip of paper, “it is written that 



the construction has a reverse 
movement — in other words, that 
it can process the objects pro- 
duced back to their original state. 
Can we see it with our own eyes?” 

“That’s the easiest thing,” 
Ogurtsov smiled. “But what for?” 

“Everything must be done 
properly,” Parovozov declared. 

“Well, in that case — ” 

Ogurtspv turned the lever to 
the right. 

The other members of the com- 
mission, still excited over every- 
thing they had seen, did not pay 
too much attention to the little 
interchange. “All right, what’s 
the difference. Let’s see.” The 
victory was obvious in any case. 

And the mountain of things be- 
gan to melt away. Objects flew in- 
to the mouth of the horn, clank- 
ing, in larger and larger quanti- 
ties. The opening was much wider 
here and could receive far more 
than the narrow end. Many ob- 
jects rose into the air and floated 
around the horn, colliding with 
each other in response to the pow- 
erful force drawing them in. 
Clouds of dust rose over the area. 
Small twisters danced around, 
occasionally combining into a 
large, powerful one. And when a 
straw hat was snatched from the 
head of one of the observers and 
carried up into the clouds the en- 
tire commission, as one man, 
dropped to the ground. Only the 
unbending Parovozov remained 
standing. He caught at the brim 



HORN OF PLENTY 



155 



of his hat and was just about to 
make a pronouncement about 
the mighty forces of nature when 
a strong current of air raised him 
up and carried him irresistibly 
toward the roaring throat of the 
horn. His body whirled lightly in 
mid-air, pushed aside several 
smaller objects, and smoothly en- 
tered the machine with the gen- 
eral stream. Parovozov had not 
even had time to remove his hand 
from his hat. 

No one saw this except Ogurt- 
sov. Everyone else was lying 
pressed to the ground, trying to 
shield their heads with their 
hands. The inventor desperately 
tried to pull the lever back to zero 
position, but it was stuck. He bore 
down on the damned lever with 
his whole puny weight, but it 
would not budge. “What a scan- 
dal! What a scandal!” he whis- 
pered past trembling lips and 
beads of sweat rolled off his fore- 
head. 

Ogurtsov looked around: Par- 
ovozov was already half swal- 
lowed by the horn. 

“Dig in with your hands, dig 
in, you damned fool!” he shouted 
in a voice he did not recognize 
as his own. Then he abandoned 
the lever and threw himself where 
only Parovozov’s legs were visible 
among the whirling armchairs, 
washstands, and bolts of fabric. 
He gripped those legs with all his 
strength and both were enveloped 
in a cloud of dust. 



Seeing that the situation was 
critical, the policeman Petrov cov- 
ered half the distance between 
himself and the horn with one 
mighty leap and then crawled on 
his belly across the dangerous 
zone. But suddenly the horn 
grunted, boomed like a copper 
bell and stopped by itself. 

A FTER a while the people 
^recovered and gathered 
around the machine. There is no 
need to describe their dismay over 
the calamity. Besides, without 
Ogurtsov no one knew, properly 
speaking, how to approach the 
horn. They tried to turn the lever 
to the left. It turned easily enough 
but that was all. Only a trickle of 
molten metal poured out of the 
horn and congealed. Yes it was 
quite a situation. 

For days engineers and me- 
chanics struggled to reanimate 
the horn. Their efforts proved al- 
most totally without results. All 
they managed was to restore the 
reverse action to some extent, so 
that the horn could process useful 
objects into scrap. Molotkov grew 
pale and lost weight. He did not 
leave the horn for a moment all 
those days. Someone began to re- 
vile Parovozov but Molotkov cut 
him off sharply. 

“It’s our own fault! The Pa- 
rovozovs should not be allowed 
within a mile of new develop- 
ments. And we — ” 

Someone else blamed Ogurtsov 



156 



GALAXY 



himself for leaving no clear in- 
structions while there was still 
time. 

“Try and explain it,” Molotkov 
countered wearily. “It’s centuries 
ahead. As mysterious as human 
computers. They’ll juggle mil- 
lions in their minds — but how? 
Try to understand.” 

The policeman Petrov suffered 
from the grievous loss along with 
everyone. Besides, it seemed to 
him that he alone was responsible 
for everything. And he could not 
bear to meet the eyes of the com- 
mission members. How could he 
have permitted this outrage to oc- 
cur? Such an idiotic request — to 
make the machine work back- 
ward! Parovozov now seemed to 
him one of those vicious hooli- 
gans who sauntered around idly 
in narrow trousers. And he almost 
convinced himself that he had 



once taken Parovozov to the pre- 
cinct for disorderly conduct while 
in a state of intoxication. But he 
had taken pity on him and let 
him go without reporting to his 
place of employment. 

In reality, of course, no such 
incident had ever taken place. 
Parovozov had lived a most ex- 
emplary life and no one could 
have brought any complaints 
against him. 

As for the horn, it was turned 
over to a group of scientists for 
restoration. However, in the 
course of the catastrophe it had 
been reduced to such a condition 
that to “restore” it meant to in- 
vent it anew. For the time being, 
alas, there is little hope of success. 
After all, not everyone is capable 
of making an invention that only 
our remote descendants will be 
equal to.

GALAXY BOOK SHELF 

(continued from page 121 ) 
so than this one. What can be seen 
here, in fleeting glimpses, are the 
parts of a “real” Asimov . the 
different sorts of mood and mem- 
ory which, stored up in a brain 
that never forgets, operate to con- 
dition the words that appear on 
the paper in the magic Asimov 
typewriter. And he comes off 
well, this Asimov does, compared 
to your standard of comparison. 

Having found this, however, the 
buyer will find little else that falls 
into a coherent pattern except with 
reference to the Asimov personal- 
ity. About all that can be said for 
this uneven book, as distinguished 
from other recent uneven Asimov 
collections, is that it does serve as 
a catalogue. Coming upon a parti- 
cularly attractive selection, such 
as one of his biographical sketches 
of scientists, the reader can go out 
and get a copy of Doubleday’s 
Asimov's Biographical Encyclope- 
dia of Science and Technology, 
for instance, and really dig in. 

This is not a negligible virtue 
in Opus 100. Considered as enter- 
tainment, however, the book as a 
whole demands so many shifts of 
personality and attitude in the 
reader that no one, not even Asi- 
mov, could keep up with them 
comfortably. Asimov himself, 
after all, only did it in half a life- 
time. If Opus 100 were a book to 



put down and pick up at intervals, 
as some other eollection might be, 
this would not be a crucial fault. 
But one can’t do that in this case, 
or else one loses the thread of the 
narrative about Ike’s life and 
thought. 

What we have, in fact, is a 
stunt. A book put together to 
serve the needs of a luncheon turn 
of phrase and — Is it cruel to say 
this? — the same sort of complai- 
sance with number magic that 
Asimov several times decries in 
Opus 100. 

Ike should not have so many 
luncheons with editors who fall un- 
der his spell. A more objective 
editorial board would not have 
passed a book like Asimov’s Mys- 
teries. for instance, with its one or 
two good stories and its tens of 
thousands of words of filler. A 
really good editor in a position to 
keep Ike from dancing away — Is 
there still such a man and do the 
economics still permit it? — would 
force him away from the kind of 
ideas that come facile to the edu- 
cated mind and nearer to the stuff 
that lives in the heart. 

As it is, this shouldn’t be Opus 
100. It should be, maybe. Opus 75, 
and the 75 should be what the 
world calls fiction and what the 
writer knows is' truth because 
mind has been bent to the aid of 
heart, as distinguished from its 
concealment. •
