I REPORT

iiuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiuiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiu^ 

Maps of the world have been 
changing fast and furiously of late. 
Until 40 or 50 years ago, changes 
were slow and gradual; but, since 
the first world war, the pace has 
been almost too fast for geography 
teachers to keep up with it. Now 
we’re going to have some new 
changes, and these will not be made 
by dictators or armies or politicians, 
but by Project Vanguard, to be 
launched with the forthcoming In- 
ternational Geophysical Year be- 
ginning July 1st. By observing the 
changes in the orbits of the various 
satellites to be sent aloft, scientists 
will very probably learn why maps, 
of the same location but made at 
different times, do not always 
agree. Scientists once argued that 
continents drifted like boats on the 
plastic core of the Earth; that land 
masses, now separated by oceans, 
were contiguous. Now, with totally 
new data about the Earth’s gravity 
and the magnetic north, new meth- 
ods of position determination might 
cause cartographers to re-do a lot 
of their work. You probably won’t 



notice it on your local road map 
and your neighbor won’t claim 
you’re growing your petunias on his 
land. But — there could be some re- 
vised boundaries that might pro- 
voke new arguments to take the 
place of the old. 

Success Story: A couple years ago 
we got a letter from an aspiring 
author who had this to say: “In the 
past I have sent you approximately 
six different tales, with no success. 
Now, curiosity compels me to ask 
you a simple question. Do you think 
I have any possibilities as a writ- 
er?” I read the accompanying 
story and returned it with a note 
that was anything but encouraging. 
“This story has nothing,” I wrote, 
underscoring the nothing. “You 
need a lot of practice . study 
everything, plot, construction, etc.” 
Last month we got another story 
and another letter in which he ex- 
plained that my note (which I had 
long forgotten) had jolted him into 
taking a course in short story writ- 
ing and now, with diploma in hand, 
he was tackling us again. The 
writer is George Revelle^ of New- 
burgh, New York, and his story 
Operation Boomerang appears in 
this issue. 

America will be short 100,000 
scientists and engineers, within 10 
years, according to a recent state- 
ment by John F. Collyer, President 
of the B. F. Goodrich Company of 
Akron, Ohio. The U. S. now has 
950,000 scientists and engineers. 
Ten years from now we will need 
1,379,000; by 1975 we will require 
the services of 2,040,000 scientists

and engineers. That, no doubt, 
is why a young graduate electrical 
engineer recently said, “Me look for 
a job?” he laughed. ‘T can write 
my own ticket with half a dozen 
places.” 

Young man going somewhere in a 
hurry seems to be the best way of 
describing Harlan Ellison, who first 
appeared in IF with Life Hutch 
and The Crackpots, Bom in Cleve- 
land 22 years ago, Harlan attended 
Ohio State U. until his English 
professor told him he would never 
sell a word. The professor was 
right — for a couple of years. A 
couple of years which turned into 
a hodge-podge of jobs which in- 
cluded runner for a bookie, “top- 
man” in a carnival, tmck driver, 
door-to-door brush salesman, logger 
and department store floorwalker. 
When he first reached New York 
he joined up with a gang of juvenile 
delinquents in Brooklyn’s tough 
Redhook section in order to gain 
experience about kid gangs. He 
turned his experiences into 250,- 
000 words of saleable juvenile de- 
linquency fiction. He works 16 
hours a day (ah, youth!) and dur- 
ing the past year he sold 80 stories 
of all sorts to various magazines of 
all sorts. He’s in an army uniform 
now, but we hope he’ll soon be 
making another appearance in IF. 

A couple of months ago I bought 
myself a copy of American Science 
and Invention, by Mitchell Wilson, 
and promptly forgot about it. Last 
week, while looking for some lost 
artwork, I literally stumbled over 



it (it’s a big book!) and realized I 
hadn’t even opened it. Well, I went 
back to my desk and sat down and 
opened it — ^and there went the rest 
of the day. On the jacket was a 
blurb that read: “The fabulous 
story of how American dreaming, 
wizardry and inspired tinkerers con- 
verted a wilderness into the won- 
der of the world.” I used to write 
book blurbs and ad copy and am 
somewhat leery about fatuous ut- 
terances by literary hucksters or 
friends of the author. After a cou- 
ple hours with the book I found I 
might easily have written the same 
glowing terms, and I don’t even 
know the author or the publisher, 
except through the pages of a week- 
ly trade journal. But to continue: 
the book is a lot of fun and I plan 
to spend many more hours with it. 
For here is the story of American 
invention and ingenuity from the 
very first patent issued in Boston 
in 1646 to Joseph Jenkes for the 
“manifactures of engins of mils to 
go by water for speedy dispatch of 
much worke with few hands” to the 
greatest discovery of modern man, 
the controlled release of nuclear 
fission. With their myriad experi- 
ments and inventions you meet 
such giants as Franklin, Priestley, 
Fulton, Henry, Morse, Goodyear, 
Underwood, Bell, Edison, Westing- 
house, Eastman, the Wright broth- 
ers, Michelson, Hale, Compton, 
Fermi and many, many others. 
American Science and Invention 
gets my vote for the most interest- 
ing book on “popular” science and 
invention published during the past 
year — all 130,000 words and 1,200 
pictures of it. — ^jlq

BY JAMES E. GUNN 



If the law of cause and effect is overthrown, 



and if ultimate understanding is impossible, 



and intelligence becomes less than worthless. 



where can a man turn — except to madness? 

green thnmli 



Johnny Sundance was seven parts Cherokee 
Indian and one part tramp printer. He was horn 
in 1972 at the Chilocco Indian School, Oklahoma, 
where his father taught mathematics. 

Johnny's father was all Cherokee, with a 
Cherokee's fierce pride and a Cherokee's stoicism. 
When he discovered what his child was, he poured 
his frustrated ambition and his knowledge into 
Johnny as his ancestors had once poured powder 
into a trade musket. 

Johnny learned to read when he was three. When 
he was five he was reading all the books in his 
father's library, and his father started him on 
algebra.

His parents died in the last of 
the great airplane crashes, before 
automatic avoidance mechanisms 
became compulsory. They had a 
reservation on an earlier plane, but 
their helicab had been trapped in 
a Los Angeles traffic jam, 

Johnny was six years old. 

The government put him into a 
primary grade pool in a modern 
school at the Haskell Indian Insti- 
tute. He graduated to the fourth 
grade at seven, began his scientific 
education at eight, and advanced 
at his own best speed until he grad* 
uated from high school at eleven, 
from college at fourteen, got his 
Ph,D, at sixteen, and passed his 
boards the same year. 

He was a specialist. Those quaU 
ified to judge his work considered 
him the most brilliant quantum 
physicist in the country. 

He won his first contest at nine 
with an original paper on atomic 
models. In the years following he 
published five books on particle 
physics and innumerable articles 
in scholarly journals. 

He liked poetry, beer, and moun* 
tain climbing. 

Just after his nineteenth birth* 
day, he disappeared. 



T he type bars slamming vi- 
ciously through the ribbon and 
paper against the hard rubber 
platen made the old-fashioned type- 
writer jump on the cluttered solid 
walnut desk. Gideon McKenzie 
glared at the paper as his stubby 
fingers jabbed at the keys. Occas* 
ionally a distant clink of metal 
against metal made him twitch, 

6 



miss a key, and swear. 

“The principle of specialization 
became inextricably embedded in 
the social matrix during the late 
1960’s,” he wrote. “It was based 
on a recognition of the green thumb 
phenomenon : everyone has a talent 
which needs only the proper envi- 
ronment of social approval, favor- 
able circumstances, and frequent, 
much admired successes to develop 
genius out of what may be only 
superior original capacity. It was 
at once the savior and the curse of 
Twentieth Century civilization. 

“The arguments for it went like 
this: you can’t have a complex 
civilization without specialists; 
knowledge has become too extensive 
for any one man to encompass it 
all. It’s as much as he can do to 
master one small aspect of a sub- 
ject. When there was much to 
learn, a spade was sufficient, but 
now that all the ground has been 
turned over, a man must dig deep 
to find virgin soil. He needs a 
sharpshooter. 

“What has been called a revolu- 
tion is actually the maturation of 
tendencies evident in the early years 
of the Electronic Age, and this is 
a lot of over-ripe manure!” 

Gideon jerked the paper out of 
the typewriter, crumpling it in his 
hand, and glowered at the machine 
as if it were to blame. A McKenzie 
glare was a terrifying thing, but 
a glower was enough to freeze even 
a typewriter’s bearings. 

Gideon was a lumpy man. He 
looked like he had been molded in 
a bass fiddle case and then a clumsy 
child had stuck on fat blobs for 
legs and arms. But his face was his 

JAMES E. GUNN 




own creation. Once it had been fat 
and jolly, but it had been carved 
by indignation and mottled by 
choler. The nose was a piece of red- 
veined putty; his eyebrows were 
dark bushes under which his pale 
blue eyes lurked in wait for the un- 
wary bungler. His hair was thick, 
black, and unkempt, like a nest he 
had slept in. 

The typewriter waited, unmoved, 
amid the precarious stacks of dusty 
books and tattered manuscripts on 
the desk. Gideon rolled another 
sheet of paper into the machine 
and began to pound the keys again. 
When he finished, he drew the 
sheet carefully out of the typewriter 
and leaning back in the wooden 
desk chair read it with an expres- 
sion of Machiavellian delight. 

Dear Barney: 

I have written many potboil- 
ers in my career, but I cannot 
stomach this tripe. If you want 
to put out a revised edition of 
Green Thumb, you will have to 
do it yourself or have some spe- 
cialist hack it out. Specialization, 
I am unalterably convinced, is a 
plague on all our houses. 

Gideon 

P.S. If you publish that book in 
any form, I will sue you. 

P.P.S. Where are this quarter’s 
royalties? 

The chair in which Gideon sat 
was the only chair in the room. An 
ancient green wool rug covered the 
floor. The walls, except for two 
doors, a real window looking out 
upon the concrete and aluminum 
peaks and cliffs of a city, and the 

GREEN THUMB 



desk, were books from rug to ceil- 
ing, stacked, heaped, stuck in side- 
ways, backwards, and upside down. 

From behind the door on the 
opposite side of the room the clink- 
ing sounds started again. A man 
cursed. Gideon’s eyebrows became 
a single thicket over his eyes. 

Something crashed. In a blur of 
motion, Gideon was out of his chair. 
He flung open the door and re- 
vealed three men in a narrow, tiled 
closet. They were standing over the 
remains of what had been an ex- 
cellent medicine cabinet. 

Gideon thundered, “What in 
the name of Moloch do you think 
you’re doing? Three men sent to 
do a boy’s job, and you’ve been 
here all morning!” 

A surly, dark-haired lavatorbot 
specialist second class said defen- 
sively, “This lavatorbot hasn’t been 
repaired for so long it wouldn’t 
work at all. When he tried to re- 
move it, the thing slipped and fell.” 
Gideon asked dangerously, “Why 
didn’t you remove it?” 

The young man drew himself up 
proudly. “I am an electronic lav- 
atorbot specialist. He” — the young 
man pointed — “is the mechanic^ 
lavatorbot specialist.” 

Muted violence was in his voice 
as Gideon said, “Did it ever occur 
to you that the lavatorbot was not 
a lavatorbot at all? It was a per- 
fectly good medicine chest, and you 
will procure me a new one im- 
mediately — and replacements for 
all the pharmaceuticals within.” He 
pointed at the old-fashioned, white- 
china commode in the comer. 
“That is what I wanted fixed — a 
simple, three-minute job an idiot 

7 




child could perform.” 

“That is completely outside my 
specialty!” 

Gideon pointed a pudgy finger at 
the third man, a tall, thin young 
man with red hair. “Why don’t you 
fix it!” 

The young man said indignantly, 
“I am a plumber, not an antiquar- 
ian. If you had a modem disposer- 
bot, it would be a simple matter. 
That is an atrocity.” 

Gideon roared, “Keep my per- 
sonal preferences out of this. Can 
you fix that thing?” 

The plumber flinched. He said 
meekly, “What seems to be wrong 
with it?” 

«It_won’t— flush.” ^ 

Gingerly the red-haired plumber 
twisted the handle on the water 
closet. Water gurgled into the bowl 
and swirled up dangerously close to 
the edge before it subsided. Slowly 
the level dropped. “Well,” said the 
plumber. “Well. My suggestion is 
that you get rid of the whole affair. 
I can get a crew of men in a few 
days, rip this thing out, and put in 
a modem disposerbot — ” 

“Young man! I like this com- 
mode. I have become accustomed 
to it. I sometimes stand here for 
hours and flush it for recreation, 
just to listen to its long, withdraw- 
ing, melancholy roar.” Gideon’s 
pale eyes lighted on the plumber’s 
open tool box. “What’s that!” 
“This?” The plumber picked 
up a rubber plunger on a stick. 
“This is known as a plumber’s 
friend.” 

“No doubt the only one you 
have,” Gregor said scathingly. “IJse 
it!” 

e 



“This, sir,” the plumber said 
icily, “is my specialist’s badge. It is 
purely ornamental.” 

With a roar of rage, Gideon 
grabbed the plunger and jabbed 
it several times into the commode. 
The water surged down and out. 
“There! Now out! All of you!” 

They fled before him, scrambling 
through the doorway and the room 
beyond, fumbling with the old- 
fashioned door into the hall. Gid- 
eon pursued them, the plumber’s 
friend waving in one hand like a 
mace. Finally the lavatorbot spe- 
cialist, electronic, got the door 
open, and they scattered in all di- 
rections down the hall. 

With a triumphant swing of his 
arm, Gideon threw the plunger 
after them, narrowly missing a tall, 
gray-haired man whose hand was 
raised to knock on the door. 

In a voice that was almost pleas- 
ant, Gideon said, “What in Beelze- 
bub’s name do you want?” 

The man stared down the hall 
toward the spot where the plunger 
clung to the distant wall like a 
native spear and then looked back 
at Gideon with incredulous eyes. 
He blinked, and his expression so- 
bered. 

“I am Carl Vigran, psycho- 
specialist, administrative assistant, 
personnel, to the president of the 
University — ” 

“My time is worth money,” 
Gideon snapped. 

Vigran said simply, “Johnny Sun- 
dance has disappeared.” 

The lean, broad-shouldered 
young man had a face that was 
hard to forget. It was broad, fiat, 

JAMES E. GUNN 




and copper-colored beneath a stiff, 
unruly mass of blue-black hair. The 
nose was prominent and aquiline, 
but the dark eyes were dull. 

He lurched drunkenly as he 
stepped off the Fifth Avenue slide- 
walk. On the stationary pavement 
he caught himself and began walk- 
ing aimlessly into the older part of 
the city. 

People turned to look at him as 
he passed, but he saw none of them. 
He stopped, finally, and turned his 
face toward the building, his eyes 
closed, his forehead leaning against 
a black, plate-glass window as if 
he were trying to cool it. 

In a moment he reeled back and 
opened his eyes. Lavender words 
wriggled across the black glass. He 
squinted at them as if he were try- 
ing to read and couldnH. Then he 
turned and shouldered his way 
through the door. He stood, sway- 
ing, just inside the entrance, star- 
ing blindly into the dim recesses of 
the room. 

Gideon leaned back comfortably 
in his desk chair, studying without 
pretense of manners the middle- 
aged man who stood uncomfort- 
ably near the door. Vigran had 
taken good care of himself ; at sixty 
he was slim and vigorous. His face 
was thin and sharp, stamped by 
the aristocracy of intelligence. He 
looked younger than his prema- 
turely gray hair suggested. Im- 
peccably dressed in a grayj one- 
piece business suit, he was a bril- 
liant man, a capable man, a spe- 
cialist. 

Gideon said calmly, “Johnny has 
disappeared. So?” 

GREEN THUMB 



Vigran’s poise shattered with the 
jerky movements of his hands. “You 
haven’t seen him?” 

“Why should I?” 

“You were his closest friend.” 
Gideon looked surprised. “Was 
I? Poor Johnny. What about wom- 
en?” 

“When he’s working on a prob- 
lem, he hasn’t time for anything 
else. None of them have seen him 
for months.” Vigran said urgent- 
ly, “We’ve got to find him, Mc- 
Kenzie. If you can help us in any 
way, if you can think of any place 
he might have gone — ” 

Gideon’s pale eyes studied 
Vigran’s face. The psychospecial- 
ist’s lip was twitching. “What makes 
Johnny so much more important 
than any of the others?” 

Vigran said quickly, “What 
others?” 

Gideon’s voice was sharp. “Don’t 
fence with me. The other special- 
ists who have disappeared, the other 
particle physicists. You can bury 
them among the personals, but you 
can’t cover them up completely. 
How many have there been in the 
last six months? Six? Seven?” 
Vigran said unhappily, “Nine.” 
“How many have you found?” 
“One. He — he came back.” 
Gideon said shrewdly, “Insane?” 
Slowly Vigran nodded. 
Thoughtfully Gideon placed the 
tips of his stubby fingers together. 
“Quite an epidemic,” he said 
cheerfully. 

Vigran said, “They’re all im- 
portant. If we can solve one we’ll 
have a clue to the others. But we 
need Johnny in particular. His re- 
cent work — ^his associates say it may 

. 9 




be the most important research in 
the last fifty years. They can’t de- 
cipher his notes. They jump over 
whole areas of development and 
proof to indecipherable conclusions. 
Interspersed are philosophical 
ramblings. Most uncharacteristic.” 
Gideon had tired of the conver- 
sation. He swung his chair toward 
the desk in a gesture of dismissal. 
“Sic your bloodhounds on him.” 
Vigran moved quickly to the 
desk, leaned over it to face Gideon. 
“They lost the trail, McKenzie. 
Like they did with the others. 
Their actions have not followed 
any anticipated pattern. Their 
movements have been random. Mc- 
Kenzie — you were Johnny’s friend. 
For Johnny’s sake!” 

Gideon stared malevolently at 
Vigran. “I remember you. A year 
ago you refused me the use of the 
University library. Said a non- 
specialist could not make effective 
use of it.” 

“A misunderstanding!” Vigran 
gasped. “That will be corrected.” 
Gideon looked down at the palms 
of his pudgy hands. They were 
dirty. “How do you know he wants 
to come back?” 

“He had everything he could 
have wanted. A free hand in his 
research, unrestricted grants to fi- 
nance it, prestige, a large salary- 
why should he leave?” Vigran hesi- 
tated. “We’re afraid of amnesia.” 
“Nine times? Amnesia is a myth. 
It was exploded many years ago. 
Why was he unhappy?” 

Vigran said sharply, “He wasn’t! 
He was at the top of his specialty 
in a profession that is universally 
admired. He was doing what he 

10 



was best fitted for; he was using 
his talent to the fullest. He enjoyed 
his work. He had security, admira- 
tion, friends . What did he 
lack?” 

“What indeed? You make it 
sound idyllic.” Gideon said sharply, 
“But he ran away.” 

Vigran’s hands fluttered ineffec- 
tually. “We don’t know that he did. 
He just — disappeared.” 

A slow, pleased smile crept over 
Gideon’s face. “You know what’s 
the matter with you? You’re a spe- 
cialist and you’ve found a problem 
you can’t solve. You’re frustrated — 
just like your bloodhounds. They 
must be thoroughly useless by now.” 
He chuckled happily. “Unless your 
problem is resolved, they’ll be look- 
ing for you one of these days.” 
Vigran drew himself up stiffly. 
“You’re forgetting yourself, Mc- 
Kenzie.” 

“No, Vigran, you’re forgetting 
that you came to me. You’re for- 
getting why you came to me. Not 
because I knew Johnny. Your spe- 
cialists could dig up more about 
Johnny than I could possibly know. 
You came to me because I am the 
last of the universal geniuses.” He 
put his elbow on the desk, propped 
his chin in his palm, and stared up 
complacently at Vigran. He looked 
like a fat man’s version of Rodin’s 
Thinker. 

Vigran gasped, “You’re mad, 
McKenzie. But maybe you’re mad 
enough to find an answer. Every- 
thing else has failed.” 

Gideon was not insulted. “I’m 
interested. Two conditions. First, 
I must have full access to your 
personnel and psychological files, as 

JAMES E. GUNN 




well as Johnny-s papers.” 

Vigran hesitated and then 
nodded. 

“Two: when I find Johnny, he 
doesn’t have to return unless he 
wishes.” 

Vigran said indignantly, “What 
do you think the University is? A 
prison?” 

“Yes,” Gideon snarled. “A prison 
for minds,” 

The servandroid stopped in 
front of the young man with the 
copper-colored face and the dull, 
black eyes and said, ^'You arenH 
well, sir. Shall I call a doctor?*^ 

He brushed the thing aside and 
walked unsteadily into the dim 
room, over the lavender carpet, 
toward a row of booths against the 
far wall. 

The place was almost deserted. 
It was quiet. The young man stag- 
gered when he reached the booths 
and caught himself on a gray, plas- 
tic table. The schooner of beer on 
it sloshed some of its contents onto 
the table. His eyes focused on the 
glass. His dark hand reached out, 
lifted it to his lips. He drained it. 

^^What you think you^re — a 
hoarse voice began. A hand grabbed 
the young man by the shoulder. 
The voice gentled. ^^Say, you^re 
sick.^’ 

Johnny Sundance slumped bone- 
lessly into the booth. 

T he lavender words wrig- 
gling on the black, plate-glass 
window spelled “Sam’s Place.” It 
was an ordinary neighborhood bar. 
Inside, it was gloomy, cool, and 

GREEN THUMB 



old-fashioned. The thick carpet- 
ing was lavender. The tables were 
gray plastic. The booths along the 
walls were upholstered in pink 
imitation leather. Female serv- 
androids, their bodies sculptured 
perfection under their tiny, trans- 
lucent uniforms, carried trays 
among the tables. 

Carl Vigran hesitated blindly at 
the entrance and then stumbled 
down three steps before he saw 
Gideon. He made his way quickly 
to the booth. “Why did you want 
me to meet you here?” 

Gideon raised to his lips an old- 
fashioned schooner of beer and 
sipped the foamy, yellow liquid 
gingerly. He wiped his mouth on 
the back of a hairy hand. “To find 
Johnny. This is where your blood- 
hounds lost the trail.” 

Vigran said impatiently, *‘I 
know that, but he isn’t coming 
back. This place has been watched 
for days.” 

“Maybe,” Gideon suggested slyly, 
“you were watching for the wrong 
person.” 

Vigran looked startled and 
pleased. “You’ve found him!” 
“Sit down.” Gideon waited until 
Vigran had slipped into the seat 
opposite. “No, I haven’t found 
Johnny. Even a universal genius 
must have more than twenty-four 
hours. First I had to learn Johnny 
inside out. I had to be able to think 
like Johnny.” 

“Well?” 

“Now I know Johnny like one of 
my own characters.” Gideon 
drained his glass and summoned 
a servandroid. “Again,” he said. 
“You see,” he said to Vigran, “I 

11 




am drinking beer, a drink I detest, 
because it was Johnny’s favorite. 
Anything more potent was fire- 
water, and the Indian has a no- 
toriously weak stomach for alcohol, 
he used to say. 

“Johnny and I met by accident. 
He had happened on a potboiler 
of mine called Green Thumb, 
written during a brief period of 
insanity when I was under the 
spell of modern education. He 
wrote to me, asking where he 
should continue his work on quan- 
tum physics. He was ten at the 
time. 

“I had come to my senses, I 
tried to discourage him, but he 
persisted. I turned his letter over 
to the University, and you re- 
cruited him, bending the NCAA 
regulations somewhat in the proc- 
ess. 

Vigran leaned toward Gideon. 
He said abruptly, “That’s better 
forgotten.” 

“Later Johnny insisted on com- 
ing around and thanking me for 
my help. Frequently. He had an 
engagingly inquisitive mind, and 
my broad range of interests fasci- 
nated him. I tried to expand his 
scope, but he was a specialist and 
satisfied to be that and nothing 
more.” 

The servandroid brought back 
Gideon’s glass. He patted her 
familiarly as she bent over the 
table. 

Vigran exploded. “That’s an 
android!” 

Gideon winked expressively. 
“You know that, and I know that. 
But does she know that? Ah, well.” 
He shrugged. “At first I suspected 



women, but Johnny has had the 
normal sexual experiences for his 
maturation group, including some 
with older women infatuated by his 
reputation. Lately he became more 
fastidious. He has led, it appears, 
a full, satisfying life.” 

Vigran said, “I told you that 
much. But why did he disappear?” 
His lip jerked. It was getting worse. 

“For the same reason the others 
disappeared.” 

Vigran’s hand began to pound 
on the table. He didn’t notice. 
“Why? Do you have a theory?” 

Gideon leaned back contemp- 
tuously. “Many. Theories are 
cheap. For instance, they may 
have been kidnaped by extrater- 
restrials.” 

Vigran made a disgusted face. 

“All right,” Gideon said mildly, 
“scratch theory number one. Num- 
ber two: when men get too intel- 
ligent they learn something that 
the rest of us are too stupid to 
see, that makes further effort futile. 

“Number three : modern edu- 
cation is forced growth. The tend- 
ency of many child prodigies to 
fail in later life is an infantile 
rebellion against authority. 

“Theory number four: think- 
ing is a disease. Intelligence, like 
size, adaptability, prolificness, 
speed, and so forth, is an evo- 
lutionary experiment. All of them 
are survival characteristics, and all 
of them carry within themselves the 
seeds of their own destruction. 

“The trouble with intelligence 
is that it sees problems and seeks 
answers. The one thing intelligence 
must have which it cannot manip- 
ulate like its environment is under- 



12 



JAMES E. GUNN 




standing. And ultimate under- 
standing is impossible. Result: 
madness' or its equivalent, the re- 
jection of intelligence.” 

Vigran’s expression had pro- 
gressed from incredulity to con- 
tempt. “Which one do you prefer?” 
he asked sarcastically. 

Gideon shrugged his plump 
shoulders. “All of them. None of 
them. I always wait for the proof 
of experimental evidence. Which 
we are about to get. See that 
man?” 

Vigran looked up. Passing them 
was a short, thick young man with 
long, untrimmed blond hair and a 
pale, scowling face. He glanced 
suspiciously at everyone he passed. 
In his hand he had a round, yellow, 
plastic container. He started up the 
steps toward the entrance. 

Vigran whispered. “That isn’t 
Johnny!” 

With great disgust, Gideon said, 
“Who said it was? He will lead 
us to Johnny.” 

It was early morning when they 
came out. The streets were de- 
serted, There was no one to notice 
a tall, black-haired, copper-skinned 
man and the short, thick blond who 
supported him as they walked, 

Johnny reeled and almost fell. 
The blond caught him, held him 
up, ^‘Just a little farther, Johnny, 
Then we^ll be home,^^ 

^^Home?'* Johnny said. He began 
to laugh, ^^Home sweet home. 
Home is where the heart is. Home 
is the sailor, home from the sea, 
and the hunter home from the 
hill,^^ The laughter broke into a 
sob. 



^^Shhhh, Johnny! Here we are,^* 
Carefully the blond young man led 
Johnny down a short flight of steps 
and put out a hand against the 
door plate. The door swung open. 
Warm, humid air came out to 
meet them. It was thick with the 
odor of green, growing things. 

As soon as the yoimg man was 
gone, Gideon moved swiftly to- 
ward the door. A servandroid 
stepped quickly into his path and 
said pleasantly, “Your bill, sir?” 
Gideon jerked a thumb at Vig- 
ran. “He’ll pay.” 

When Vigran had caught up 
with Gideon, the lumpy man was 
gazing intently into a shop window. 
It featured a display of stretch 
shoes. There were all about size 
five. The sign on the window said, 
“This is your size.” 

“You’re mad!” Vigran panted. 
“Shhhh! He’s gone into the seed 
shop across the street.” 

The short, thick man came out 
of the store, glancing both ways. 
He did not notice Gideon or Vig- 
ran, whom Gideon had swung 
around to face the shop window. 

“Now,” Gideon said. He turned 
and walked casually down the 
street. The stocky man was just 
turning the comer ahead. Now he 
had two containers in his hand. 
“Ah!” Gideon said. 

Vigran trotted to keep up with 
Gideon. “That fellow can’t have 
anything to do with Johnny. He’s 
obviously an unspecialized laborer.” 
“Hah!” Gideon said. They 
txurned the corner. Their quarry was 
disappearing into the basement en- 
trance of a decrepit, green-tinted 

13 



GREEN THUMB 




concrete slab apartment building. 
“I see now why you couldn’t pos- 
sibly find Johnny. It’s because of 
the very nature of specialization.” 

Vigran said crisply, “Nonsense! 
I don’t know what you’re doing, 
but I know this much: without 
specialization our society would 
have disintegrated long ago.” 

Gideon breathed noisily through 
his putty nose. “Specialists are tame 
animals. They are trained to do 
one thing well. But what happens 
when they meet totally unforeseen 
conditions? They fail. They cannot 
cope, because that is the function 
of the wild, unspecialized animal. 
You couldn’t find Johnny because 
his disappearance was unpredict- 
able. 

“Every science that deals with 
man ignores everything except what 
it deals with. Medicine deals with 
the physical man, economics with 
that simplification known as Eco- 
nomic Man, psychiatry with a 
fictitious creature in whom it would 
have no interest if he were ‘nor- 
mal,’ and one branch of psychol- 
ogy with I.Q. Man, whose only 
significant aspect is his ability to 
solve puzzles. 

“Literature is the only thing 
that deals with the whole complex 
phenomenon at once. If it were 
to cease to exist, whatever is not 
considered by one or another of the 
sciences would no longer be con- 
sidered at all and would perhaps 
vanish completely.” 

Skepticism battled hope across 
Vigran’s face. “Then he’s in there?” 

“We shall see.” Gideon waddled 
heavily down the concrete steps. 
“Carl Vigran to see Johnny Sun- 

14 



dance,” he said to the red door. 

The door cleared its throat rust- 
ily. “This is the residence of Otto 
Haber. There is no one here named 
Johnny Sundance.” 

“Announce me,” Gideon said 
sharply. “Carl Vigran.” 

Vigran asked sharply, “Why 
don’t you use your own name?” 
“He’s afraid of me.” The door 
stood silent and unmoved. “Come, 
Otto,” Gideon muttered. “We are 
waiting.” 

Vigran said, “What makes you 
think he’s here?” 

Gideon said, “Johnny was flee- 
ing. He was trying to escape. He 
needed something he had not had 
for fourteen years — emotional se- 
curity.” 

Vigran said in a pained voice, 
“You’re talking my specialty. That 
isn’t done — not by a layman.” 

“I’m talking about something 
you’ve forgotten: love. The kind 
that asks nothing but the chance to 
love. The kind that makes no de- 
mands, that incurs no responsibil- 
ities. Johnny stumbled into Sam’s 
Place — and met Otto.” 

Vigran looked startled. “What 
are you trying to imply?” 

Gideon turned his massive head 
so that his pale blue eyes looked 
straight and hard at Vigran. 
“Nothing. I am telling you what 
happened. If you want to make 
inferences, I can assure you that 
they are wrong. No one noticed 
Johnny when he left Sam’s Place 
because he came in alone and left 
with Otto. No one saw him on the 
street because it was very late, and 
your bloodhounds were looking for 
one man, not two. And here Johnny 

JAMES E. GUNN 




has been ever since/* 

Gideon turned back to the door 
and began to bang on it with his 
fist. 

“Please!” said the doorbot in a 
shocked voice. “Sir!” 

Vigran said, “All right, then, 
how did you find him?” 

“I checked the central retail food 
billings. In this neighborhood, only 
one person’s bill has increased in 
the last few days without reason. 
Otto Haber’s.” A furtive note of 
doubt crept into Gideon’s voice. 
“Oddly enough, though, only by 
about one-third.” 

Disgustedly Vigran said, “Guess- 
work! I should have known better 
than to follow a fool on a fool’s 
errand,” He took a step toward the 
street. 

The door opened a crack. The 
stocky young man’s blond, suspi- 
cious face peered out. “What you 
want?” he asked hoarsely. 

“We’ve come to see Johnny,** 
Gideon said quietly. 

“Never heard of him. Ain’t no- 
body here but me.” He tried to 
slam the door, but Gideon was 
leaning against it. “Get out of 
here!” 

“When we see Johnny,” Gideon 
said. 

Vigran tugged at Gideon’s sleeve. 
“Come on, McKenzie. Don’t get 
us both into trouble.” 

Otto paid no attention to Vig- 
ran. His hard eyes were fixed on 
Gideon. “You got a warrant says 
you can break in a man’s home?” 
Gideon shook his head. “No war- 
rant. We can get one if we have to. 
But if we get a warrant you’ll lose 
Johnny for sure. All we want to do 

GREEN THUMB 



is see him, and we’ll leave. If 
Johnny doesn’t want to come, this 
man promises to leave him alone.” 

Otto shifted his glaring eyes to 
Vigran and back again to Gideon. 
“Who’s he?” 

“Administrative assistant to the 
president at the University. Where 
Johnny was. He wants Johnny 
back. Let us in now and that will be 
the end of it.” 

Unexpectedly the door swung 
open. “All right,” Otto snarled. 
“See him and get out!” 

Otto carried the packages into 
the bedroom, for once not stopping 
to look at his flowers or the tank 
farm. His face was eager as he 
handed Johnny the plastic con^ 
tainer. ^^Here, Johnny. Here^s your 
beerf^ 

The copper-faced young man 
lying on the rumpled bed, his black 
eyes staring blindly at the ceiling 
with its intricate network of fine 
cracks, slowly sat up. He took the 
container and tore off the strip that 
sealed the top. He raised it to his 
thin lips and then spat a mouthful 
on the floor beside the bed. ^^Ifs 
warm/^ he said flatly. ^^You stopped 
somewhere/* 

^"Honest, Johnny/* Otto said. 
^^Just long enough to get some bug 
spray. It must have been warm 
when they sold it to me. I*ll take 
it back, Johnny. You want I should 
take it back?** 

^^No. I don*t want it anyway.** 
Johnny laid down again and looked 
at the mottled wall. 

Hopefully Otto said, ^^I*m gonna 
make some stew tonight. I got me 
some real beef bouillon cubes. I*ll 

15 




get me some potatoes and carrots 
and cabbage fresh from the farm — 
Johnny, is there something wrong?** 
Anybody follow you?** 

^^No, Johnny. I was careful like 
you said.** 

^^Then why is somebody at the 
door?** 

Otto raised his head and listened. 
He could hear it now, the cracked 
voice of the doorbot saying, ^^Carl 
Vigran for Johnny Sundance.** 

Otto said, won*t go. They got 
no business here. They*ll think no- 
body* s home. They*ll go away.** 

Contemptuously Johnny said, 
^^They saw you come in. Answer 
the door.** 

Johnny, what are you gonna 
do?** 

^^Don*t let Vigran in. He*ll need 
a warrant. He*s a fool. He*ll go 
away, but he*ll be back. As soon as 
he goes away, 1*11 leave.** 

Slowly Otto said, Where would 
you go, Johnny? What would you 
do?** 

*^Who cares? Now answer the 
door, stupid!** 

Otto said softly, ^^Don*t leave me, 
Johnny.** 



T here was a short entrance 
hall lined on either side with a 
long box filled with flowers. Their 
colors were brilliant under the sun- 
lamps beaming down warmly from 
the ceiling: bright yellow, scarlet, 
gentian blue, purple, violet, emer- 
ald . ♦ . The air was warm and 
steamy and filled with the odor of 
green things growing and the 
mingled scent of many flowers. 
Otto had an aersol spray in one 

16 



hand. He held it as if it were a 
bomb he was prepared to throw 
at any moment. 

Gideon glanced sharply at the 
flowers and then led Vigran down 
the hall over the pitted, green 
plastic tile. The hall opened into 
a small living room. The room was 
dim, but the odor of vegetation 
was even stronger. The room was 
made even smaller by a wide, flat 
tank that covered two-thirds of the 
floor. There were vegetables grow- 
ing in it — potatoes, carrots, beets, 
tomatoes, green beans, corn — their 
roots floating in a nutrient solution. 
Somewhere a pump gurgled 
quietly. It was the only sound in 
the room. 

Gideon’s eyes brightened. ‘‘Ah. 
Fresh food!” 

Otto sneered. “He’s in there!” 
He pointed to a doorway. 

Gideon stopped just inside the 
next room. It was even smaller 
than the living room. There was 
space for a bed, a marred, black 
table, and two rickety chairs. Cur- 
tains closed off an alcove. Gideon 
guessed that it was a cooking area. 
The room was sour and dirty. 

Johnny was propped up in the 
bed, the covers wrinkled and gray 
around him. Beside him was a 
plastic container of beer. His broad, 
flat face was turned toward the 
doorway. He looked at Gideon for 
a moment with obsidian eyes and 
then turned his head toward the 
wall. The room was silent. 

“These men,” Otto said softly. 
“They come to see you, Johnny. 
You know them?” 

Johnny didn’t move. 

Vigran edged into the room and 

JAMES E. GUNN 




took it in with one horrified glance. 
“Johnny! What are you doing here? 
Why did you run away? What — ?” 
Gideon said flatly, “Shut up!” 
He walked over to one of the chairs 
and drew it up to the bed. Gingerly 
he eased his massive body onto it, 
listening to it creak beneath him. 
When he was sure it would not 
collapse beneath him, he leaned 
forward. 

He said gently, “Johnny! We 
aren’t going to stay long. We aren’t 
going to take you away unless you 
want to come. We just want to 
talk for a moment.” 

Johnny stared at the wall. Fi- 
nally, without turning, he said tone- 
lessly, “What are you doing here?” 
“Vigran asked me to help.” 
“Why did you?” 

“It was the only way I could be 
sure he wouldn’t cart you off if he 
did find you. He promised to leave 
you alone if you decide to stay.” 
Indignantly Vigran said, “Mc- 
Kenzie!” 

“Shut up!” Gideon said wearily. 
Johnny said, “How did you find 
me?” 

“Chance,” Gideon said, 

A slow tremor ran over Johnny’s 
lean body. “No. You thought it 
all out. You knew. Why don’t you 
leave me alone?” 

“We will, Johnny,” Gideon said. 
“In just a moment. I know why 
you ran away.” 

Johnny turned his head to look 
at Gideon. His black eyes were 
fierce and hawklike. “Do you? Do 
you really? Do you know what it 
is to realize that you have wasted 
your life, that everything you have 
tried to do is futile, that nothing 

GREEN THUMB 



has any meaning?” 

Gideon said, “Yes.” 

Johnny said violently, “Chance 
rules the universe. Man is only a 
minute flyspeck in the cosmos, 
tossed here and there by the 
Brownian Movement of fate. He’s 
still a mindless blob of protoplasm. 

“I know now what killed my 
parents. Not an airplane. Chance. 
Chance brought me to the Univer- 
sity. Chance drove me away.” 

Vigran whispered to Gideon, 
“I’ll get help.” 

Gideon didn’t look away from 
Johnny. “Stay where you are! He 
isn’t crazy.” 

Coldly Johnny said, “No. I’m 
sane. Too sane. Too sane for my 
own good.” 

“Come back, Johnny,” Vigran 
pleaded. “If there was anything 
wrong with the way we treated 
you, if — ” He looked at Johnny’s 
eyes and stopped. 

Gideon said, “He doesn’t under- 
stand, Johnny. I think maybe you 
owe him an explanation. Other 
men have disappeared. It’s driving 
him insane.” 

“Let him read my notes. It’s all 
there.” 

Otto had been looking at Johnny 
without understanding. Now he 
said, “You want I should throw 
them out, Johnny?” 

Vigran turned on him furiously. 
“You, Haber! You know what 
you’ve got here in this rat’s nest? 
The finest mind of our generation. 
He’s got more than fifty thousand 
dollars in the bank, and he’s lying 
here in rags and filth.” 

Otto’s puzzled eyes turned back 
toward Johnny. “Is that right, 

17 




Johnny? You got all that money?” 

Johnny shrugged. “What good 
is it?” 

“You could go back to that?” 

“Fm never going back.” 

Otto took a step toward the bed. 
“I been keeping you, buying you 
beer. And you got fifty thousand. 
You’re no good, Johnny! I don’t 
like you.” His voice was climbing 
toward a scream. “Get out!” He 
hit Johnny across the face with the 
back of his hand. “Get out!” 

The most important single gift 
of science to civilization was free- 
dom from superstition: the idea 
that order, not caprice, governs the 
world, that man was capable of 
understanding it. Beginning with 
Newton^s discovery of the universal 
sway of the law of gravitation, man 
felt himself to he in a congenial 
universe; all things were subject to 
universal laws. 

But that conviction arose from 
the narrowness of his horizons. 
When he extended his range he 
found that nature was neither un- 
derstandable nor subject to law. 
For this we may thank Planck, 
Einstein, Bohr, and Heisenberg. 

Heisenbergs uncertainty princi- 
ple set an unsuspected limit on the 
accuracy with which we can de- 
scribe physical situations. If we 
measure one quality accurately we 
can^t do the same for another. 
Perfect accuracy in the measure- 
ment of the position of an electron 
denies us any measurement at all 
of its velocity. Therefore an electron 
canh have both position and ve- 
locity. 

A physical concept has meaning 

18 



to the physicist only in terms of 
some sort of measurement. A body 
has position only in so far as its 
position can be measured. If it 
can^t be measured, the concept is 
meaningless — a position of the body 
doesn't exist. By choosing whether 
we shall measure position or ve- 
locity, we determine which of those 
qualities the electron has. The 
physical properties of an electron 
are not inherent; they involve the 
choice of the observer. 

The law of cause and effect is 
invalid; it gives only an approxi- 
mation ( just as quantum mechanics 
gives its answers only in statistical 
probability). Events are not caus- 
ally connected; the concept of cause 
has no meaning. 

Whenever we observe something, 
our sensory equipment reacts on 
the object observed, and that in- 
teraction can't be reduced below 
a minimum. When the minimum 
interaction is taking place, the 
object can't be observed; we can't 
measure with an instrument as 
coarse as the thing we are trying 
to analyze. 

The physicist has come to the 
end of his domain. He has reached 
the point where knowledge must 
stop because of the nature of knowl- 
edge itself. Beyond this point, mean- 
ing ceases. We do not live in a 
world of reason, understandable by 
the intellect of man. As we pene- 
trate deeper, the very law of cause 
and effect which we had thought 
to be a formula to which we could 
force God himself to subscribe, 
ceases to have meaning. 

(Excerpt from the notebooks of 
Johnny Sundance) 

JAMES E. GUNN 




J OHNNY LOOKED at Otto 
with eyes that were suddenly 
warm with knowledge. While his 
cheek slowly grew a darker red, 
he said gently, “Don’t be a fool, 
Otto. You can’t drive me away.” 
He looked at Vigran. “I don’t think 
I can ever forgive you.” 

Gideon said, “He’s desperate. 
He’s lost.” 

“There’s no way of predicting 
photon movements,” Johnny threw 
at Vigran. “No way at all. They’re 
governed by chance.” 

Vigran looked bewildered and 
afraid. “That doesn’t make sense. 
That’s no reason to — ” 

Gideon said ironically, “It isn’t 
your specialty. The function of in- 
telligence is to solve problems. 
What if it finds a problem for 
which there can be no solution? It 
protects itself by going mad or 
denying its own existence. Johnny 
is a specialist, and his specialty has 
led him into a blind alley where 
the only way to go is out the way 
he came in.” 

Johnny repeated, “Chance rules 
the universe.” 

“That’s — that’s nothing but su- 
perstition.” 

Gideon said, “Science giveth and 
science taketh away.” 

“Get this,” Johnny said. “This 
is the last time I’ll say it, the last 
time I’ll think about it. You’re try- 
ing to determine the position and 
velocity of an electron. In order 
for it to be seen, a photon must 
strike it and be reflected into your 
detection instrument, but the very 
act of striking deflects the electron 
so that it isn’t where it was or it 
isn’t going with the velocity it had. 

GREEN THUMB 



“Make two slits. Reflect a photon 
so that it may enter either one. 
Which does it enter? Sometimes 
one, sometimes the other. And you 
can’t ever be sure which!” 

Vigran shook his head desper- 
ately. “But that all takes place at 
the level of the electron. It doesn’t 
affect us.” 

Gideon said, “Compton sug- 
gested an experiment in which a 
ray of light is diffracted through 
two slits so that it may enter either 
of two photoelectric cells. Through 
one it explodes a stick of dynamite; 
through the other it throws a switch 
which prevents the dynamite from 
exploding. What determines wheth- 
er the dynamite explodes? Chance.” 
Johnny said quickly, “In the 
same way the nervous system of a 
living organism acts as an ampli- 
fier, so that its actions depend on 
events on so small a scale that they 
are subject to Heisenberg Uncer- 
tainty. A neuron fires or does not 
fire because at a lower level an 
electron goes one way or another.” 
Vigran looked back and forth 
between them. “But then it’s an 
old idea. You already knew this, 
Johnny. Why should it bother you 
now?” 

Johnny shivered. “I accepted it 
intellectually. Now I know it. It’s 
no use trying to understand the 
universe. Intelligence is worthless. 
The universe is governed by pure 
chance.” With a finality that 
seemed beyond argument Johnny 
turned his head once more to the 
wall. “Now go away.” 

Vigran began, “But — ” 

Otto turned on Vigran savagely 
as if he was hoping for resistance. 

19 




**You heard him. Get out!” 

“Just a moment,” Gideon said 
quietly. “I’d like to talk to you a 
moment, Otto. How would you like 
a job?” 

Johnny turned his head to look 
back at Gideon suspiciously. Otto’s 
eyes narrowed. “What kind of 
job?” 

“Doing what you’re doing here. 
Growing things. Only all the time 
and with more equipment.” 

“Where?” Otto said hoarsely. 

“At the University.” 

“McKenzie — ” Vigran ex- 

claimed. 

“Shut up, Vigran! What do you 
say, Otto?” 

“What do they want food for?” 
Otto asked sullenly. 

“Not food, Otto — knowledp.” 

“See here, McKenzie!” Vigran 
broke in. “We can’t hire him. He’s 
a layman. He doesn’t have a spe- 
cialty or a degree — 

Gideon turned on him fiercely. 
“You’re interested in the green 
thumb phenomenon. Talent isn’t 
all intellectual. How did he do 
that?” He jerked his thumb to- 
ward the tank filled with flourishing 
vegetation.” 

Vigran spluttered, “Why he just 
— He knows — ” 

“A layman? Without a specialty 
or a degree? He doesn’t know any- 
thing. He’s got a green thumb. 
Why?” 

“Maybe,” Vigran muttered. 
“Maybe.” 

Gideon turned back to Otto. 
“What do you say, Otto? It means 
two or three times what you’re mak- 
ing now. It means a chance to do 
what you like to do. Grow things.

you.” 

Johnny said fiercely, “Don’t do 
it, Otto! They’ll tear you apart!” 
Otto frowned. “What about 
Johnny?” 

“He can live with you at the 
University until he decides what he 
wants to do.” 

Johnny said, “It’s just a trick, 
Otto!” 

“I don’t go without Johnny.” 
“Let me talk to him,” Gideon 
said. “For the last time. Go talk to 
Dr. Vigran about the job.” 

Otto hesitated for a moment 
and then with a long look at 
Johnny left the room. The little 
room was silent for a long time 
while Gideon and Johnny looked 
at each other, 

“Why are you doing this to me?” 
Johnny asked. 

Gideon said, “I know what 
you’re going through.” 

Violently Johnny said, “You! 
What do you know?” 

“I went through it myself. These 
others — they can’t understand what 
it is to stake their lives on an idea 
— and feel the idea vanish beneath 
them. You’re floundering, Johnny, 
trying to find solid ground. Don’t 
do yourself irreparable damage in 
the process.” 

“You’re lying to me.” 

Gideon took a deep breath. For 
a moment he looked not like a 
lumpy old man but a hero. “Look 
at me, Johnny! Why do you think 
I’m a fat buffoon wasting my talent 
on potboilers. Why do I punish my- 
self and the world, lashing out at 
everyone who comes within 
tongue’s range? Because I lived too 

JAMES E. GUNN 




long with fear and despair.’' 
Johnny said hopelessly, “There 
isn’t any solid ground.” 

“Think of this. If cause and 
effect is overthrown, so is predes- 
tination. Free will is given back to 
Man. He can choose without the 
inner certainty that the choice was 
made for him by an inexorable 
pattern fixed in the instant of the 
explosion of the primordial giant 
atom. You’re free, Johnny. You can 
be whatever you want to be — ex- 
cept God.” 

Johnny laughed, but his voice 
broke in the middle. “Who wants 
to be God — that must be a lousy 
job. But what else is there to be?” 
“A man. A suffering, erring, lov- 
ing man. A free man. God is in- 
extricably bound by his own omnis- 
cience. Only man is free.” 

“But what is there to do?” 
“Perhaps there are other routes 
besides intelligence, other ways to 
control chance. Ask Otto how he 
does it; ask him in a way he can 
answer, as you would ask a ques- 
tion of nature. Other people have 



similar talents. Find out how they 
work, and perhaps you can make 
another assault on the citadel of 
ultimate knowledge.” 

Johnny stretched his arms out 
wide and sat up on the edge of the 
bed. Suddenly he looked very 
young. “Perhaps,” he said. “I’ll — 
I’ll think about it.” 

Gideon said gently, “Yes, 
Johnny. You think about it.” 

In the next room, Gideon said, 
“Go in with Johnny, Otto. I think 
he would like to talk to you.” 
Vigran whispered, “Well? Will 
he come back?” 

Gideon nodded wearily. “Yes. 
He’ll come back.” His pale eyes 
moved slowly around the room. 
He stared thoughtfully at the hy- 
droponic tank. 

“What about the others?” 
Gideon spun around angrily. 
“That’s your responsibility! I do 
not like to play God.” His voice 
dropped. “I do not like it at all.”

BY ROBERT SILVERBERG 



He had been sent to the psiless 
world to learn to hide his t.k. 



power. That was very clear. 
But how was he to survive? 



hidden 

talent 



T he spaceport on Mon- 

darran IV was a small one, as 
might be expected on the sort of 
fifth-rate backwater world it was. 
Rygor Davison picked up his lone 
suitcase at the baggage depot and 
struck out into the dry, windy heat 
of mid-afternoon. The sun — G- 
type, hot — was high overhead, and 
a dusty brown dirt road ran 
crookedly away from the rudimen- 
tary spaceport toward a small gray 
village about a thousand meters 
away. 

There was no one on hand to 
greet him. Not an impressive wel- 
come, he thought, and began to 
walk down the dirt road toward the 
village which would be his home 



22 




for the next five years — if he sur- 
vived. 

After he had gone half a dozen 
steps, he heard someone behind 
him, turned, and saw a small boy, 
heavily tanned, come trotting down 
the road. He was about eleven, 
and clad in a pair of golden swim 
trunks and nothing else. He 
seemed to be in a hurry. 

“Whoa, youngster!” Davison 
called. 

The boy looked up questioning- 
ly, slowed, and stopped, panting 
slightly. “Just get here? I saw the 
ship come down!” 

Davison grinned. “Just got here. 
What’s the hurry?” 

“Witch,” the boy gasped. 
“They’re giving him the business 
this afternoon. I don’t want to miss 
it. Come on — hurry along.” 
Davison stiffened. “What’s go- 
ing to happen, boy?” 

“They’re roasting a witch,” the 
boy said, speaking very clearly, as 
one would to an idiot or an ex- 
tremely young child. “Hurry along, 
if you want to get there on time — 
but don’t make me miss it.” 
Davison hefted his suitcase and 
began to stride rapidly alongside 
the boy, who urged him impa- 
tiently on. Clouds of dust rose from 
the road and swirled around them. 

A witch-burning, eh? He shud- 
dered despite himself, and won- 
dered if the Esper Guild had sent 
him to his death. 

The Guild of Espers operated 
quietly but efficiently. They had 
found Davison, had trained him, 
had developed his enormous po- 
tential of telekinetic power. And 

24 



they had sent him to the outworlds 
to learn how not to use it. 

It had been Lloyd Kechnie, Da- 
vison’s guide, who explained it to 
him. Kechnie was a wiry, bright- 
eyed man with a hawk’s nose and 
a gorilla’s eyebrows. He had 
worked with Davison for eight 
years. 

“You’re a damned fine tele- 
kinetic,” Kechnie told him. “The 
guild can’t do anything more for 
you. And in just a few years, you’ll 
be ready for a full discharge.” 

“Few years? But I thought — 

“You’re the best tk I’ve seen,” 
said Kechnie. “You’re so good that 
by now it’s second nature for you 
to use your power. You don’t know 
how to hide it. Someday you’ll re- 
gret that. You haven’t learned 
restraint.” Kechnie leaned forward 
over his desk. “Ry, we’ve decided 
to let you sink or swim — and you’re 
not the first we’ve done this to. 
We’re going to send you to a psiless 
world — one where the powers 
haven’t been developed. You’ll be 
forced to hide your psi, or else be 
stoned for witchcraft or some such 
thing.” 

“Can’t I stay on Earth and 
learn?” Davison asked hopefully. 

“Uh-uh. It’s too easy to get by 
here. In the outworlds, you’ll face 
an all-or-nothing situation. That’s 
where you’re going.” 

Davison had gone on the next 
ship. And now, on Mondarran IV, 
he was going to learn — or else. 

“Where you come from?” the 
boy asked, after a few minutes of 
silence. “You goin’ to be a colonist 
here?” 



ROBERT SILVERBERG 




“For a while,” Davison said. 
“I’m from Dariak III.” He didn’t 
want to give any hint of his Earth 
background. Dariak III was a 
known psiless world. It might mean 
his life if they suspected he was 
an esper. 

“Dariak III?” the boy said. 
“Nice world?” 

“Not very,” Davison said. “Rains 
a lot.” 

Suddenly a flash of brilliant 
fire burst out over the village ahead, 
illuminating the afternoon sky like 
a bolt of low-mounting lightning. 

“Oh, damn,” the boy said dis- 
gustedly. “There’s the flare. I 
missed the show after all. I guess 
I should have started out earlier,” 

“Too late, eh?” Davison felt 
more than a little relieved. He 
licked dry lips. “Guess we missed 
all the fun.” 

“It’s real exciting,” the boy said 
enthusiastically. “Especially when 
they’re good witches, and play 
tricks before we can bum ’em. You 
should see some of the things they 
do, once we’ve got ’em pinned to 
the stake.” 

1 can imagine^ Davison thought 
grimly. He said nothing. 

They continued walking, mov- 
ing at a slower pace now, and 
the village grew closer. He could 
pick out the nearer buildings fairly 
clearly, and was able to discern 
people moving around in the 
streets. Overhead, the sun pelted 
down hard. 

A shambling, ragged figure 
appeared and came toward them 
as they headed down the final 
twist in the road. “Hello, Dumb 
Joe,” the boy said cheerily, as the 

HIDDEN TALENT 



figure approached. 

The newcomer grunted a mono- 
syllable and kept moving. He was 
tall and gaunt-looking, with a 
grubby growth of beard, open- 
seamed moccasins, and a battered 
leather shirt. He paused as he 
passed Davison, looked closely into 
his face, and smiled, revealing yel- 
low-stained teeth. 

“Got a spare copper, friend?” 
Dumb Joe asked in a deep, rum- 
bling voice. “Somethin’ for a poor 
man?” 

Davison fumbled in his pocket 
and pulled out a small coin. The 
boy glared at him disapprovingly, 
but he dropped the coin into the 
waiting palm of the panhandler. 

“Best of luck, mister,” the beggar 
said, and shuffled away. After a 
few steps he turned and said, “Too 
bad you missed the roasting, mister. 
It was real good.” 

They proceeded on into the 
town. Davison saw that it con- 
sisted of a sprawling group of two- 
story shacks, prefabs, apparently, 
strung loosely around a central 
plaza — in the heart of which, Da- 
vison noticed, was a sturdy steel 
post with something unpleasant 
smouldering at its base. He shud- 
dered, and looked away. 

“What’s the matter, mister?” 
the boy asked derisively. “Don’t 
they roast witches on Dariak III?” 

“Not very often,” Davison said. 
He found that his fingers were 
trembling, and he struggled to re- 
gain control over them. 

He thought of Kechnie, com- 
fortably back on Earth. While he 
was out here, on a fly-plagued dust 
hole of a world, doomed to spend 

25 




the next five years in a two-bit vil- 
lage twiddling his thumbs. It was 
like a prison sentence. 

No— worse. In prison, you don’t 
have any worries. You just go 
through your daily rock-crumbling, 
and they give you three meals and 
a place, of sorts, to sleep. No 
agonies. 

Here it was different. Davison 
barely repressed a curse. He’d have 
to be on constant lookout, supress- 
ing his psi, hiding his power — or 
he’d wind up shackled to that steel 
gibbet in the central plaza, provid- 
ing a morning’s entertainment for 
the villagers before he went up in 
flames. 

Then he grinned. Kechnie knows 
what he^s doing, he admitted de- 
spite himself. If I survive this, Pll 
be fit for anything they can throw 
at me. 

He squared his shoulders, fixed 
a broad grin on his face, and 
headed forward into the town. 

A tall man with a weather- 
creased face the color of curdled 
turpentine came toward him, lop- 
ing amiably. 

“Hello, stranger. My name’s Do- 
marke — I’m the Mayor. You new 
down here?” 

Davison nodded. “Just put down 
from Dariak III. Thought I’d try 
my luck here.” 

“Glad to have you, friend,” Do- 
marke said pleasantly. “Too bad 
you missed our little show. You 
probably saw the flare from the 
spaceport.” 

“Sorry I missed it too,” Davison 
forced himself to say. “You have 
much trouble with witches down 
here?” 



Domarke’s face darkened. “A 
little,” he said. “Not much. Every 
once in a while, there’s a guy who 
pulls off some kind of fancy stunt. 
We’ve been pretty quick to send 
them to their Master the second we 
spot them. We don’t want none 
of that kind here, brother.” 

“I don’t blame you,” Davison 
said. “Men aren’t supposed to do 
things the way those guys do.” 
“Nossir,” the Mayor said. “But 
we fix ’em when they do. There 
was a fellow down from Lanargon 
Seven last year, took a job here as 
a beekeeper. Nice boy — young, with 
a good head on his shoulders. Saw 
a lot of my daughter. We all liked 
him. We never suspected he was a 
wronger.” 

“Witch, eh?” 

“Sure was,” Domarke said. 
“Swarm of his bees got loose and 
broke up. They come after him, 
and started stinging away. Next 
thing we know, he’s looking at 
them kinda funny and fire starts 
shootin’ from his fingertips.” Do- 
marke shook his head retrospec- 
tively. “Burned all those bees to 
tatters. He didn’t even try to stop 
us when ^ strung him up.” 

“Strung; him up? How come you 
didn’t burn him?” Davison asked, 
morbidly curious. 

Domarke shrugged. “Wasn’t any 
point to it. Those guys in league 
with fire, you don’t get anywhere 
trying to burn ’em. We hang them 
on the spot.” 

One of Kechnie^ s boys, probably, 
Davison thought. A pyrotic sent 
out here to learn how to control 
his power. He didn't learn fast 
enough.

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




He chewed at his lower lip for 
a second and said, “Guess it’s about 
time I got to my point. Who can 
I see about getting a room in this 
town?” 



T hey found him a room 
with a family named Rinehart, 
on a small farm about ten minutes’ 
walk from the heart of the village. 
They had posted a sign advertising 
for a hired hand. 

He moved in that afternoon, un- 
packed his meager belongings, and 
hung up his jacket in the tiny closet 
they provided. Then he went 
downstairs to meet his hosts. 

It was a family of five. Rinehart 
was a balding man of fifty-five or 
so, dark skinned from long hours of 
toil in the blazing sun, heavy- 
jowled and jovial. His wife — Ma — 
was a formidable woman in an 
amazingly archaic-looking apron. 
Her voice was a mellow mascu- 
line boom, and she radiated an at- 
mosphere of simple, traditional 
folksiness. It was, thought Davison, 
a frame of mind long since extinct 
on so sophisticated a planet as 
Earth. 

They had three children — Janey, 
a long-legged, full-bodied girl of 
eighteen or so; Bo, a sullen-faced, 
muscular seventeen-year-old ; and 
Buster, a chubby eleven-year-old. 
It seemed to be a happy familial 
setup, thought Davison. 

He left his room — painstakingly 
opening and closing the door by 
hand — and ambled down the 
stairs. He slipped on the fourth 
from the bottom, started to slide, 
and teeked against the landing to 

HIDDEN TALENT 



hold himself upright. He caught 
his balance, straightened up, and 
then, as he realized what he had 
done, he paused and felt cold drop- 
lets of sweat starting out on his 
forehead. 

No one had seen. No one this 
time. 

But how many more slips would 
there be? 

He let the shock filter out of 
his nervous system, waited a mo- 
ment while the blood returned to 
his cheeks, and then finished de- 
scending the stairs and entered the 
living-room. The Rineharts were 
already gathered. 

“Evening, Ry!” Rinehart said 
pleasantly. 

“Evening, sir,” Davison said. He 
smiled at the rest of them, and took 
a seat. 

“All unpacked?” Ma Rinehart 
asked. “You like your room?” 

“It’s fine, Mrs. Rinehart.” 

"'Ma, if you don’t mind.” 

“All right — Ma. I like the room 
just fine. I’m going to be very hap- 
py here.” 

“Sure you are,” Rinehart said. 
“Maybe it’s not as fancy a place 
as some, but you’ll like it here. 
We’re good people on this world — 
sound, sane, feet-on-the-ground 
people. I can’t think of any planet 
I’d rather live on.” 

“At the moment, neither can I,” 
Davison lied. “After Dariak III, 
anything would be an improve- 
ment.” 

“It’s a damned rainy world 
there,” Rinehart muttered. “You’ll 
get some good sun on your face 
here. Two weeks out in my fields 
and you’ll lose that fishbelly pale- 

27 




ness of yours, Ry.” 

Janey appeared in the doorway 
and glanced indolently at Davison. 
“Supper’s on,” she said. 

Rinehart scooped himself out of 
his big chair and they followed 
him to the kitchen, ranging them- 
selves around the table. “That seat 
down there’s yours,” Rinehart said. 

Davison sat down. Rinehart, at 
the head of the table, uttered a 
brief but devout blessing, finish- 
ing up with a word of prayer for 
the new hired hand who had come 
among them. Then Janey appeared 
from the back with a tray of steam- 
ing soup. 

“Hot stuff,” she said, and Bo and 
Buster moved apart to let her serve 
it. She brought the tray down — 
and then it happened. Davison saw 
it starting, and bit his lip in an- 
guish. 

One of the scalding bowls of soup 
began to slide off the end of the 
tray. He watched, almost in slow 
motion, as it curled over the lip of 
the tray, dipped, and poured its 
steaming contents on his bare 
right arm. 

Tears of pain came to his eyes — 
and he didn’t know which hurt 
more, the pain of the soup on his 
arm or the real shock he had re- 
ceived when he had forced himself 
to keep from teeking the falling 
soup halfway across the room. 

He bit hard into his lip, and sat 
there, shivering from the mental 
effort the restraint had cost him. 

Janey put down the tray and 
fussed embarrassedly over him. 
“Gee, Ry, I didn’t mean that! 
Gosh, did I bum you?” 

“I’ll live,” he said. “Don’t trou- 

28 



ble yourself about it.” 

He mopped the soup away from 
his corner of the table, feeling the 
pain slowly subside. 

Kechnie, Kechnie, you didn^t 
send me on any picnic! 

Rinehart gave him a job, work- 
ing in the fields. 

The staple crop of Mondarran 
IV was something called Long 
Beans, a leguminous vegetable that 
everyone ate in great quantities, 
pounded down into wheat, and 
used for a dozen other purposes. It 
was a tough, almost indestructible 
plant that yielded three crops a 
year in the constant warmth of 
Mondarran IV. 

Rinehart had a small farm, ten 
acres or so, spreading out over a 
rolling hill that overlooked a 
muddy swimming-hole. It was al- 
most time for the year’s second 
crop, and that meant a laborious 
process of stripping the stalks of 
the twisted pods that contained 
beans. 

There were, of course, machines 
that whisked down the rows of 
plants, ripping loose the pods and 
depositing them in a hopper in 
which the beans were extracted, 
the pods baled, and the leaves 
stripped away, all in a moment. 
Davison had seen them in opera- 
tion on Earth one summer, when 
he’d paid a visit to the farmlands 
of miidlewestem America. 

They had such machines on 
Mondarran IV, too. Lord Gabriel- 
son had one — he was the wealthy 
landowner who farmed a thou- 
sand acres on the other side of the 
river. Lord Darnley, back the other 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




way, had one too. But Dirk Rine- 
hart and the other small farmers 
stripped their pods by hand, with- 
out complaining. 

“You bend down like this and 
rip,” Rinehart said, demonstrat- 
ing for Davison. “Then you swivel 
around and drop the pod in the 
basket behind you.” 

“Doesn’t look like fun,” Davison 
said. 

“It isn’t.” Rinehart straightened 
up and extended a thick, powerful, 
corded forearm. “This is what 
happens to you after a while. But 
hard work’s its own reward, son. 
Don’t ever forget it.” 

Davison grinned. “Don’t worry 
about me, sir. I’m here to work.” 
“I wasn’t accusing you, boy. 
Come on — take a furrow through 
with me, just to get the feel of it.” 
Rinehart strapped the harness 
around Davison’s shoulders, then 
donned his own, and together they 
started through the field. Overhead, 
the sun was high. It always seems 
to be noon on this planet, Davison 
thought, as he began to sweat. 

Purple-winged flies buzzed nois- 
ily around the thick stalks of the 
bean-plants. Dragging the basket 
behind him, Davison advanced 
through the field, struggling to keep 
up with Rinehart. The older man 
was already ten feet ahead of him 
in the next furrow, ducking, 
bobbing, yanking, and depositing 
the pod in the basket, all in a 
smooth series of motions. 

It was hard work. Davison felt 
his hands beginning to redden from 
the contact with the rough sand- 
paper surfaces of the plants’ 
leaves, and his back started to 

HIDDEN TALENT 



ache from the constant repetition 
of the unaccustomed pattern of 
motion. Down, up, reach around. 
Down, up, reach around. 

He ground his teeth together 
and forced himself to keep going. 
His arm was throbbing from the 
exertion of using muscles that had 
lain unbothered for years. Sweat 
rolled down his forehead, crept into 
his collar, fell beadily into his 
eyebrows. His clothes seemed to be 
soaked through and through. 

He reached the end of the fur- 
row at last, and looked up. Rine- 
hart was waiting there for him, 
arms akimbo, looking almost as 
cool and fresh as he had when he 
had begun. He was grinning. 

“Tough sled, eh, Ry?” 

Too winded to say anything, 
Davison simply nodded. 

“Don’t let it get you. A couple of 
weeks out here, and it’ll toughen 
you up. I know how you city fel- 
lows are at the start.” 

Davison mopped his forehead. 
“You wouldn’t think just pulling 
pods off a plant could be so rough,” 
he said. 

“It’s tough work, and I’m not 
denying it,” Rinehart said. He 
pounded Davison affectionately on 
the back. “You’ll get used to it. 
Come on back to the house, and 
I’ll get you some beer.” 



AVISON STARTED in as a 
full-time picker the next day. 
It was, like all the other days prom- 
ised to be, hot. 

The whole family was out with 
him — the two elder Rineharts, 
Janey, Bo, and Buster. Each had 

29 





his own harness strapped on, with 
the basket behind for dropping in 
the pods. 

“We’ll start down at the east 
end,” Rinehart said, and without 
furAer discussion the entire crew 
followed him down. Each took a 
furrow. Davison found himself with 
Janey on his left. Bo Rinehart on 
his right. Further down the field, 
he could see Dirk Rinehart already 
fearsomely making his way through 
the close-packed rows of plants, a 
two-legged picking machine and 
nothing more. He watched the 
older man’s effortless motions for 
a moment, and then, conscious that 
Janey and Bo were already a few 
steps ahead of him, he set to work. 

He was wearing an open shirt 
and a pair of ragged trousers that 
he’d had since his college days. It 
was his most comfortable outfit. 
Bo was wearing a pair of jeans, no 
shirt; the upper part of his body, 
sunbronzed and heavy-muscled, 
gleamed brightly. Buster, the 
younger brother, whose body still 
retained some youthful chubbiness, 
was clad in the swim trunks that 
seemed to be the customary boys’ 
garb. Janey wore briefs and a sort 
of wraparound halter; Davison 
eyed her lean brown legs approv- 
ingly. It was an efficient farming 
machine, this family. He plunged 
into his work with a will, happy to 
be part of their unit. 

The morning sun was still climb- 
ing in the sky, and the day had not 
yet reached its peak of heat, but 
Davison began to perspire after 
only a few moments of bending and 
yanking. He stopped to rub his 
sleeve over his forehead and heard 

30 



light, derisive laughter come from 
up ahead. 

Flushing hotly, he glanced up 
and saw Janey pausing in her fur- 
row, hands on her hips, grinning 
back at him. It was much the 
same pose her father had taken 
the day before, and it irritated him. 
Without saying anything, he bent 
his head and returned to the job 
of picking. 

A muscle at the base of his right 
arm began to complain. It was 
the business of reaching back and 
thrusting the picked pod into the 
basket that was doing it, straining 
the arm-socket muscles in a way 
they had never been used before. 

Kechnie’s mocking words drifted 
back to him. ‘'You donH want your 
muscles to atrophy y son/^ They had 
been words spoken lightly, in jest — 
but, Davison now realized, they 
carried with themselves a certain 
measure of truth. 

He had relied on his psi for the 
ordinary tasks of life, had gloried in 
his mastery of the power to relieve 
himself of a portion of everyday 
drudgery. Little things — things like 
opening doors, pulling up hassocks, 
moving furniture. It was simpler 
to teek an object than to drag it, 
Davison had always felt. Why not 
use a power, if you have it to per- 
fection? 

The answer was that he didn’t 
have it to perfection — yet. Perfec- 
tion implied something more than 
utter control of objects; it meant, 
also, learning moderation, knowing 
when to use the psi and when not 
to. 

On Earth, where it didn’t mat- 
ter, he had used his power almost 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




promiscuously. Here he didn’t dare 
to — and his aching muscles were 
paying the price of his earlier in- 
dulgence. Kechnie had known what 
he was doing, all right. 

They reached the end of the 
furrow finally. Davison and Buster 
Rinehart came in in a dead heat 
for last place, and Buster didn’t 
even seem winded. Davison thought 
he caught a shred of disapproval 
on Rinehart’s face, as if he were 
disappointed at his hired hand’s 
performance, but he wasn’t sure. 
There was a definite expression of 
scorn on Janey’s face; her eyes, 
under their heavy lids, sparkled at 
him almost insultingly. 

He glanced away, over to Rine- 
hart, who was emptying his basket 
into the truck that stood in the 
middle of the field. “Let’s dump 
here before we start the next row,” 
he said. 

The field seemed to stretch out 
endlessly. Davison lifted his basket 
with nerveless fingers and watched 
the gray-green pods tumble into 
the back of the truck. He replaced 
it in his harness, feeling oddly light 
now that the dragging weight no 
longer pulled down on him. 

He had a fleeting thought as they 
moved on to the next batch of 
furrows: How simple it would be 
to teek the pods into the baskets! 
No more bending, no swivelling, no 
arms that felt like they were ready 
to fall off. 

Simple. Sure, simple — ^but if 
Janey or Bo or any of the others 
should happen to turn around and 
see the beanpods floating myste- 
riously into Davison’s basket, he’d 
be roasting by nightfall. 

HIDDEN TALENT 



Damn Kechnie, he thought sav- 
agely, and wiped a glistening bead 
of sweat from his face. 

What had seemed like a wry joke 
half an hour before now hung 
temptingly before Davison’s eyes as 
as very real possibility. 

He was almost an entire furrow 
behind the rest of them. He was 
disgracing himself. And his poor, 
unused, unathletic body was aching 
mercilessly. 

He had the power, and he wasn’t 
using it. He was penning it up 
within himself, and it hurt. It was 
the scalding soup all over again ; he 
didn’t know if it hurt more to keep 
bending and dragging his numb 
arm back up again in the blister- 
ing heat, or to pen the psi up with- 
in him until it seemed almost to be 
brimming out over the edges of his 
mind. 

Davison forced himself to con- 
centrate on what he was doing, 
forced himself to forget the power. 
This is the learning process, he told 
himself grimly. This is growing up. 
Kechnie knows what he^s doing. 

They reached the end of the 
furrow, and through a dim haze of 
fatigue he heard Rinehart say, 
“Okay, let’s knock off for a while. 
It’s getting too hot to work, any- 
way.” 

He shucked off his harness and 
dropped it where he was, and be- 
gan to walk back toward the farm- 
house. With an unvoiced sigh of 
relief, Davison wriggled out of 
the leather straps and stood 
up straight. 

He made his way across the field, 
noticing Janey fall in at his side.

“You look pretty bushed, Ry,” she 
said. 

“I am. Takes a while to get used 
to this sort of work, I guess.” 

“Guess so,” the girl said. She 
reached out and kicked a clump 
of dirt. “You’ll toughen up,” she 
said. “Either that or you’ll fall 
apart. Last hired man we had fell 
apart. But you look like better 
stuff.” 

“Hope you’re right,” he said, 
wondering who the last hired man 
was and what power it was that he 
had cooped up within himself. For 
some, it wouldn’t be so bad. A pre- 
cog wouldn’t need a training ses- 
sion like this — but precogs were one 
in a quadrillion. Telepaths might 
not, either, since anyone who had 
tp already had such a high-voltage 
mind that this sort of kindergarten 
toilet-training was unnecessary. 

It was only the garden-variety 
espers who needed trips to the psi- 
less worlds, Davison thought. 
Telekinetics and pyrotics, and 
others whose simple, unspecialized 
powers lulled them into false se- 
curity. 

A new thought was entering 
Davison’s mind as he crossed the 
field, with Janey’s distracting legs 
flashing at his side. A normal man 
needed some sort of sexual release; 
long-enforced continence required 
a special kind of mind, and most 
men simply folded from the sus- 
tained tension. 

How about a normal esper? 
Could he keep his power bottled 
up like this for five years? He was 
feeling the strain already, and it 
was just a couple of days. 

Just a couple of days, Davison 

32 .1 



thought. He’d been hiding his psi 
only that long. Then he stopped to 
think how many days there were in 
five years, and he began to perspire 
afresh. 

Two more days in the field 
toughened him to the point where 
each picking-session was no longer 
a nightmare. His body was a 
healthy one, and his muscles adapt- 
ed without too much protest to 
their new regime. He could hold 
his own in the field now, and he felt 
a gratifying broadening of muscle 
and increase of vigor, a develop- 
ment of mere physical power which 
somehow pleased him mightily. 

“Look at him eat,” Ma Rinehart 
commented one night at supper. 
“He puts it away like it’s the last 
meal he’s ever going to see.” 

Davison grinned and shovelled 
down another mouthful of food. 
It was true; he was eating as he 
had never eaten before. His entire 
life on Earth seemed peculiarly 
pale and cloistered, next to this 
ground-hugging job on Mondarran 
IV. He was rounding into fine 
shape, physically. 

But what was happening to his 
mind was starting to worry him. 

He had the tk well under con- 
trol, he thought, despite the fairly 
constant temptation to use it. It 
hurt, but he went right on living 
without making use of his para- 
normal powers. But there was a 
drawback developing. 

Early on the fifth morning of his 
stay on Mondarran IV, he came 
awake in an instant, sitting up in 
bed and staring around. His brain 
seemed to be on fire; he blinked, 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




driving the spots away, and climbed 
out of bed. 

He stood there uneasily for a 
moment or two, wondering what 
had happened to him, listening to 
the pounding of his heart. Then he 
reached out, found the trousers 
draped over a chair, and slipped 
into them. He walked to the win- 
dow and looked out. 

It was still long before dawn. 
The sun was not yet gleaming on 
the horizon, and, high above, the 
twin moons moved in stately pro- 
cession through the sky. They cast 
a glittering, icy light on the fields. 
Outside, it was terribly quiet. 

Davison knew what had hap- 
pened. It was the reaction of his 
tortured, repressed mind, jolting 
him out of sleep to scream its pro- 
test at the treatment it was re- 
ceiving. You couldn’t just stop 
teeking, just like that. You had to 
taper off. That was it, thought Da- 
vison. Taper off. 

He made his way down the 
stairs, sucking in his breath in fear 
every time they creaked, and left 
the farmhouse by the side door. 
He trotted lightly over the ground 
to the small barn that stood at the 
edge of the field, brimming over 
with picked bean pods. 

Quickly, in the pre-dawn silence, 
he hoisted himself up the ladder 
and into the bam. The warm, 
slightly musty odor of masses of 
pods drifted up at him. He dropped 
from the ladder, landed hip-deep 
in pods. 

Then, cautiously, he brought his 
tk into use. A flood of relief came 
over him as he teeked. He reached 
out, lifted a solitary pod, flipped it 

HIDDEN TALENT 



a few feet in the air, and let it fall 
back. Then another; then, two at 
a time. It continued for almost 
fifteen minutes. He revelled in the 
use of his power, throwing the pods 
merrily about. 

One thing alarmed him, though. 
He didn’t seem to have his old 
facility. There was a definite effort 
involved in the telekinesis now, 
and he sensed a faint fatigue after 
a few moments of activity. This 
had never happened to him before. 

The ominous thought struck 
him: suppose abstinence hurt his 
ability? Suppose five solid years of 
abstinence — assuming he could 

hold out that long — ^were to rob 
him of his power forever? 

It didn’t seem likely. After all, 
others had gone on these five-year 
exiles and returned with their pow- 
ers unimpaired. They had ab- 
stained — or had they? Had they 
been forced into some expedient 
such as this, forced to rise in the 
small hours and go behind some- 
one’s bam to teek or to set fires? 

Davison had no answers. Grimly, 
he teeked a few more pods into the 
air, and then, feeling refreshed, he 
climbed back out the window and 
down the long ladder. 

Buster Rinehart was standing on 
the ground, looking up curiously at 
him. 

He caught his breath sharply and 
continued descending. 

‘‘Hey there,” Buster said. “What 
you doin’ in there, Ry? Why ain’t 
you asleep?” 

“I could ask you the same 
thing,” Davison said, determined 
to Wuff it out. His hands were 
shaking. What if Buster had spied 

33 




on him, watched him using his 
power? Would they take a small 
boy’s word on so serious a charge? 
Probably they would, on a psiless, 
witch-hysterical world like this* 
“What are you doing out of bed, 
Buster? Your mother would whale 
you if she knew you were up and 
around at this hour.” 

“She don’t mind,” the boy said. 
He held out a bucket that slopped 
over with greasy-looking pale 
worms. “I was out gettin’ fishbait. 
It’s the only time you can dig it, in 
the middle of the night with the 
moons shining.” He grinned con- 
fidentially up at Davison. “Now 
what’s your story?” 

“I couldn’t sleep. I just went for 
a walk,” Davison said nervously, 
hating the necessity of defending 
himself in front of this boy. “That’s 
all.” 

“That’s what I thought. Having 
sleepin’ troubles, eh?” Buster asked. 
“I know what’s the matter with 
you, Ry. You’re out mooning after 
my sister. She’s got you so crazy 
for her you can’t sleep. Right?” 

Davison nodded immediately. 
“But don’t tell her, will you?” He 
reached in a pocket and drew out 
a small coin, and slipped it into the 
boy’s palm. Instantly the stubby 
fingers closed around it, and the 
coin vanished. “I don’t want her to 
know anything about the way I feel 
till I’ve been here a while longer,” 
Davison said. 

“I’ll keep shut,” said the boy. 
His eyes sparkled in the light of the 
twin moons. He grasped the can of 
worms more tightly. He was in pos- 
session of a precious secret now, 
and it excited him. 

34 



“What say we go back to bed?” 
Davison suggested. 

“I need couple of more worms. 
You can go, if you want to.” 

“See you in the morning,” Davi- 
son said. He turned and headed 
back to the farmhouse, grinning 
wryly. The net was getting tighter, 
he thought. He was at the point 
where he had to invent imaginary 
romances with long-legged farm- 
girls in order to save his skin. 

It had worked, this once. But he 
couldn’t risk getting out there a 
second time. His private teeking in 
the barn would have to stop. He’d 
need to find an outlet somewhere 
else. 

Puzzled, he climbed back into 
bed and pulled the covers down 
tight. A few minutes later, he 
drifted into a troubled sleep. 



W HEN MORNING finally 
came, Davison went down- 
stairs and confronted old Rinehart. 

“Morning, Ry. What’s on your 
mind, son?” 

“Can you spare me for today, 
sir? I’d like to have some free time, 
if it’s all right with you.” 

The farmer frowned and 
scratched the back of one ear. 
“Free time? At harvest? Is it really 
necessary, boy? We’d like to get 
everything picked before season’s 
out. It’s going to be planting-time 
again soon enough, you know.” 

“I know,” Davison said. “But I’d 
still like to have the morning free. I 
need to think soii^ things out.” 
“Got troubles,^ eh?” Rinehart 
said sympathetically. He shrugged. 
“Okay, Ry. I’m no slave-driver. 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




Take the morning off, if you want. 
You can make up the time on Sun- 
day.” 

“Fair enough,” Davison said. 

The heat was just beginning as 
he trudged away from the Rinehart 
farm and down to the muddy 
swimming-hole at the far end of 
their land. He skirted it and headed 
on into the thick forest that sepa- 
rated their land from that of 
wealthy Lord Gabrielson. 

He struck out into the forest, 
which was delightfully cool. Thick- 
boled, redleaved trees stood arrayed 
in a closely-packed stand of what 
looked like virgin timber; the soil 
was dark and fertile looking, and a 
profusion of wild vegetation spread 
heavily over the ground. Above, 
there was the chittering of colorful 
birds, and occasionally a curious 
bat-winged creature fluttered from 
branch to branch of the giant trees. 

He knew why he was on Mon- 
darran IV: to learn moderation. 
To learn to handle his power. That 
much was clear. But how was he 
going to survive? 

The religious setup here was one 
of jealous orthodoxy, it seemed, 
and the moral code made no allow- 
ance for any deviatory abilities. Psi 
meant witchcraft — a common 

equation, apparently, on these 
backwater psiless worlds. The farm- 
ers here had little contact with the 
more sophisticated planets from 
which they had sprung, ten or 
twenty centuries before, and some- 
how they had reached a point of 
cultural equilibrium that left no 
room for psi. 

That meant Davison would have 
to suppress his power. Only — he 

HIDDEN TALENT 



couldn’t suppress it. Five days of 
watchful self-control and he was 
half out of his mind from the strain. 
And what if he ran into a position 
where he had to use his psi or be 
killed? Suppose that tree over there 
were to fall directly on him; he 
could push it away, but what would 
that avail if someone were watch- 
ing — someone who would cry 
“Witch!” 

Yet men had come to Mondar- 
ran IV and returned, and survived. 
That meant they had found the 
way. Davison threaded further on 
into the forest, trying to arrange his 
thoughts coherently. 

The forest, he thought, was a 
pleasant place, not at all like the 
fly-bitten farmland beyond. The 
curtain of trees effectively screened 
out the searching beams of the sun, 
and down at shrub-level it was a 
cool, sweet-smelling, silent world. 

He glanced up ahead. A winding 
river trickled softly through the 
trees. And, it seemed to him, up 
ahead a blue curl of smoke rose up 
over the bushes. Was someone 
using a fire there? 

Cautiously, he tiptoed forward, 
cursing every time his foot cracked 
a twig. After a few tense moments, 
he rounded a bend in the path and 
discovered where the fire was com-^ 
ing from. 

Squatting at the edge of the 
river, holding a pan in one hand, 
was Dumb Joe — the beggar he had 
encountered on the road from the 
spaceport. The beggar was still clad 
in his tattered leather outfit, and 
he seemed to be roasting a couple 
of fish over a small fire. 

Grinning in relief, Davison came 

35 




closer. And then the grin vanished, 
and he stood in open- jawed aston- 
ishment. 

Dumb Joe was roasting fish, all 
right. But there wasn’t any fire — 
except for the radiation that 
seemed to be streaming from his 
fingertips. 

Dumb Joe was a pyrotic. 

Davison hung in midstride, fro- 
zen in amazement. Dumb Joe, a 
filthy, ignorant half-imbecile of a 
beggar, was casually squatting in 
the seclusion of the forest, psionical- 
ly cooking a couple of fish for 
breakfast. A little further up the 
bank, Davison saw a rudely-con- 
structed shack which was evidently 
Dumb Joe’s home. 

The answer to the whole thing 
flooded through his mind instantly. 
It made perfect sense. 

It was impossible to live in Mon- 
darran society with a psi power and 
survive the full five years. It was 
too hard to keep from unintention- 
al uses of power, and the strains at- 
tendant ‘on the whole enterprise 
were too great for most men to 
stand. 

But one could live alongside so- 
ciety — as a wandering hobo, per- 
haps, frying fish in the forest — and 
no one would notice, no one would 
be on hand to see your occasional 
practice of psi. No one would sus- 
pect a flea-ridden tramp of being a 
witch. Of course not! 

Davison took another step for- 
ward, and started to say something 
to Dumb Joe. But Dumb Joe 
looked up at the sound of the foot- 
step. He spotted Davison standing 
some twenty feet away, glared 
angrily at him, and let the pan of 

36 



fish drop to the ground. Reaching 
down to his hip, he whipped out a 
mirror-surfaced hunting knife, and 
without the slightest hesitation sent 
it whistling straight at Davison. 

In the brief flashing instant after 
the knife left Dumb Joe’s hand, a 
thought tore through Davison’s 
mind. Dumb Joe would have to be 
an Earthman like himself, serving 
his five-year stay out on Mondar- 
ran. And therefore it wasn’t nec- 
essary to hide his own psi power 
from him, wasn’t necessary to lei 
the blade strike — 

Davison whisked the knife aside 
and let it plant itself to the hilt in 
the soft earth near his foot. He 
stooped, picked it up, and glanced 
at Dumb Joe. 

“You — teeked it away,” the beg- 
gar said, almost incredulously. 
“You’re not a spy!” 

Davison smiled. “No, I’m a tk. 
And you’re a pyrotic!” 

A slow grin crept over Dumb 
Joe’s stubblebearded face. He 
crossed the ground to where Davi- 
son was standing, and seized his 
hand. “You’re an Earthman. A 
real Earthman,” he said exultantly, 
in a half whisper. 

Davison nodded. “You too?” 
“Yes,” Dumb Joe said. “I’ve 
been here three years, and you’re 
the first I’ve dared speak to. All the 
others I’ve seen have been burned.” 
^^All of them?” Davison asked. 

“I didn’t mean that,” Dumb Joe 
said. “Actually hardly any get 
burned. The Guild doesn’t lose as 
many men as you might think. But 
the ones I’ve known about got 
roasted. I didn’t dare approach 
those I wasn’t sure about. You’re 



ROBERT SILVERBERG 




the first — and you saw me first. I 
shouldn’t have been so careless, but 
no one ever comes out this way but 
me.” 

“Or another crazy Earthman,” 
Davison said. 

He didn’t dare to spend much 
time with Dumb Joe — whose real 
name, he discovered, was Joseph 
Flanagan, formerly of Earth. 

In their hurried conversation in 
the forest, Flanagan explained the 
whole thing to him. It was a per- 
fectly logical development. Appar- 
ently a great many of the Earth- 
men sent to such planets adopted 
the guise of a tramp, and moved 
with shambling gait and rolling 
eyes from one village to another, 
never staying anywhere too long, 
never tipping their hands as to the 
power they possessed. 

They could always slip off to the 
forest and use their power private- 
ly, to relieve the strain of absti- 
nence. It didn’t matter. No one was 
watching them; no one expected 
them to be witches. It was perfect 
camouflage. 

“We’d better go,” Flanagan said. 
“It isn’t safe, even this way. And I 
want to last out my remaining two 
years. Lord, it’ll be good to take 
baths again regularly!” 

Davison grinned. “You’ve really 
got it figured,” he said. 

“It’s the simplest way,” said 
Flanagan. “You can’t bat your head 
against the wall forever. I tried liv- 
ing in the village, the way you’re 
doing. I almost cracked inside a 
mondi, maybe less. You can’t come 
down to their level and hope to 
survive; you’ve got to get below 

HIDDEN TALENT 



their level, where they don’t expect 
to find witches. Then they’ll leave 
you alone.” 

Davison nodded in agreement. 
“That^makes sense.” 

“I’ll have to go now,” said Flana- 
gan. He allowed his muscles to re- 
lax, adopted the crooked gait and 
the character of Dumb Joe again, 
and without saying goodbye began 
to straggle off further into the for- 
est. Davison stood there for a while, 
watching him go, and then turned 
and started back the way he came. 

He had an answer now, he 
thought. 

But by the time he had emerged 
from the forest and felt the noon- 
day sun beating down, he wasn’t so 
sure. Kechnie had once told him, 
run away^ He hadn’t ex- 
plained — but now Davison knew 
what he meant. 

Dumb Joe Flanagan would last 
out his five years with a minimum 
of effort, and when he returned he 
would get his release and become a 
member of the Guild. But had he 
really accomplished his goal to the 
fullest? Not really, Davison told 
himself. It wouldn’t be possible for 
him to hide as a beggar forever; 
sometime, somewhere, it would be 
necessary for him to function as a 
member of society, and then Flana- 
gan’s five years of shambling would 
do him little good. 

There had to be some other way, 
Davison thought fiercely. Some way 
to stick out the five years without 
burying his head like an ostrich. 
Some way that would leave him fit 
to return to society, or to live in 
some psiless society, and still have 
his psi power under firm control. 

37 




He strode through the hot fields. 
Off in the distance, he could see 
the Rinehart family finishing up a 
furrow. It was noon, and they 
would be knocking off now. As he 
looked, he saw sturdy Dirk Rine- 
hart finish his furrow and empty his 
pods into the waiting truck, and be- 
fore he had come within shouting 
distance the rest of them had done 
so too, and were standing around 
relaxing after a hard morning’s 
work. 

“Well, look who’s back!” Janey 
exclaimed, as Davison drew near. 
“Have a nice morning’s relaxa- 
tion?” 

“I did some heavy thinking, 
Janey,” Davison said mildly. “And 
I’ll be making up my time on Sun- 
day, while you’re resting. It bal- 
ances out.” 

Old Rinehart came over, smil- 
ing. “All thought out, youngster? I 
hope so, because there’s a rough 
afternoon’s work waiting for us.” 

“I’ll be with you,” Davison said. 
He clamped his lips together, not 
listening to what they were saying, 
wondering only where the way out 
might lie. 

“Hey, look at me,” called a pip- 
ing voice from behind him. 

“Put those down!” Dirk Rine- 
hart ordered sternly. “Get down 
from there before you break your 
neck!” 

Davison turned and saw Buster 
Rinehart, standing upon the cab of 
the truck. He had some bean pods 
in his hands, and he was energet- 
ically juggling them through the 
air. “Look at me!” he yelled again, 
evidently proud of his own acro- 
batic skill. “I’m juggling!” 

38 



A moment later he lost control 
of the pods. They fell and scattered 
all over the ground. A moment 
later, the boy was yowling in pain 
as his father’s palm administered 
punishment vigorously. 

Davison chuckled. Then he 
laughed louder, as he realized what 
had happened. 

He had his answer at last 

Davison gave notice at the end 
of the week, after working particu- 
larly hard in the field. He felt a 
litde guilty about quitting just be- 
fore planting time, and he had 
grown to like the Rineharts more 
than a little. But it was necessary 
to pull out and move on. 

He told Dirk Rinehart he would 
go after another week had elapsed, 
and though the farmer had obvi- 
ously not been pleased by the news, 
he made no protest. When his week 
was up, Davison left, gathering his 
goods together in his suitcase and 
departing by foot. 

He needed to cover quite a dis- 
tance — ^far enough from the village 
so that no one would trace him. He 
hired one of the nearby farmers’ 
sons to drive him to the next town, 
giving him one of his remaining 
coins to do so. Folded in his hip 
pocket was the crumpled wad of 
bills that was his salary for his stay 
at Rinehart’s, above room and 
board. He didn’t want to touch 
that money at all. 

The boy drove him through the 
flat, monotonous Mondarran coun- 
tryside to another town only slight- 
ly larger than the first, and other- 
wise almost identical. 

“Thanks,” Davison said simply, 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 




got out, and started to walk. He 
entered the town — it, too, had its 
witch-pole — and started looking 
around for a place to live. He had 
many preparations to tend to be- 
fore he would be ready. 



S IX MONTHS later, the signs 
started to appear all over the 
local countryside. They were gaudy, 
printed in three colors, bright and 
eye-catching. They said, simply, 

THE PRESTIDIGITATOR 
IS COMING! 

It caused a stir. As Davison 
drove his gilded, ornate chariot into 
the first town on his itinerary, the 
rambling village on the far side of 
Lord Gabrielson’s domain, a crowd 
gathered before him and preceded 
him down the main street, shouting 
and whooping. It wasn’t every day 
of the year that a travelling ma- 
gician came to town. 

He drove solemnly behind them 
down the wide street, turned the 
chariot around, and parked it al- 
most in front of the steel witch- 
pole. He set the handbrakes, low- 
ered the little platform on which he 
was going to perform, and stepped 
out, resplendent in his red-and-gold 
costume with billowing cloak, in 
full view of the crowd. He saw a 
little ripple of anticipation run 
through them at his appearance. 

A tall yokel in the front called 
out, “Are you the presti — prestig — 
the whatever you are?” 

“I am Marius the Prestidigitator, 
indeed,” Davison said in a sepul- 
chral voice. He was enjoying it. 

HIDDEN TALENT 



“Well, just what do you do, Mr. 
Marius?” the yokel replied. 

Davison grinned. This was better 
than having a shill or a trained 
stooge in the crowd. “Young man, 
I perform feats that stagger the 
imagination, that astound the mind, 
that topple reality.” He waved his 
arms over his head in a wild, gran- 
diose gesture. “I can call spirits 
from the vasty deep!” he thun- 
dered. “I hold the secrets of life 
and death!” 

“That’s what all you magicians 
say,” someone drawled boredly 
from the back of the crowd. “Let’s 
see you do something, before we 
have to pay!” 

“Very well, unbeliever!” Davi- 
son roared. He reached behind 
himself, drew forth a pair of wax 
candles, struck a match, and lit the 
candles. “Observe the way I han- 
dle these tapers,” he said sonorous- 
ly. “Notice that I handle the fiery 
flames without experiencing the 
slightest harm.” 

He hefted the candles, tossed 
them aloft, and began to rotate 
them telekinetically so that when- 
ever they came down, it was the 
unlit end he grasped. He juggled 
the two candles for a moment or 
two, then reached back, drew forth 
a third, and inserted it into the 
rotation. He remained that way for 
a moment, and the crowd grew si- 
lent as Davison tottered around 
under the candles, pretending to be 
having all sorts of difficulties. Final- 
ly, when the wax became too pli- 
able to handle easily, he teeked 
the candles down and caught them. 
He waved them aloft. The crowd

Ron definitely didn’t like what had happened. But 



who can blame him? How would you like to wake 



and find your body had been switched for a child’s? 



BRAINCHILD 



R on CARVER’S day was beginning strangely. 

For one thing, the legs he swung off the narrow bed 
wouldn’t touch the floor. And his hands, whose ten strong 
fingers could manipulate the controls of any ship ever launched 
into space, were weak and clumsy. 

He looked at the hands first, looked at them for a long 
time. Then he screamed. 

He screamed until footsteps were loud in the corridor out- 
side his room; shrill, piping screams that didn’t stop even 
when the giant woman-face was bending over him, speaking 
gentle, soothing words, stroking his thin shoulders with giant, 
comforting gestures. 

“There, there, now,” the woman was saying. “You’re all 
right, Ronnie. You’re all right. It was only a nightmare . 
a bad old nightmare . .” 

She was right. Only the nightmare hadn’t ended. The night- 
mare was before his face, in her gargantuan features, in her 
motherly touch on his frail body, in the sight of the small, soft 
appendages that were his hands. 

They were the hands of a boy of twelve. And Ron Carver 
was thirty years old. 



41 




Two men giants joined the 
woman at his bedside, and one of 
them forced a small speckled cap- 
sule past his resisting lips. Then 
his viewpoint became detached and 
distant, and a pleasurable drowsi- 
ness overcame him. He stretched 
out and shut his eyes, but he could 
still hear the worried tones of their 
speech. 

“Dr. Minton warned us,” one of 
the men said, lifting Ron’s bony 
wrist and feeling for the pulse. 
“The boy has suffered some severe 
traumatic shock . .” 

Dr. Minton! Ron Carver’s mind 
grasped the familiar name — the 
name of his own physician — grate- 
fully. But his body gave no sign. 

“Maybe we better call him,” the 
woman said nervously. “I think 
he’s still in the sick bay.” 

“Good idea.” 

In another moment, a familiar 
hairy face was floating over Ron’s 
head like a captive balloon, a face 
grown grotesque in size. 

“Doctor . he said with his 
lips. 

“There.” Dr. Minton patted his 
shoulder. “You’re all right now, 
Ronnie. You’re perfectly all right. 
Just relax and try to sleep.” The 
balloon came closer, and the 
scraggly ends of the doctor’s beard 
brushed his cheek. Then the doc- 
tor’s mouth was covering his small 
ear. 

“Play the game,” the doctor 
^whispered. “For your own sake. 
Play the game, Ron . .” 

Then he was asleep. 

He awoke to the sound of run- 
ning feet. He sat up in bed and 

42 



looked towards the door of the 
small white room in which he was 
confined. It was partly open, and 
the sound of clattering soles and 
shrill young voices came through 
clearly. 

The door slammed open, star- 
tling him. A hoydenish youngster 
gaped at him. There was a flat lock 
of reddish hair over his forehead, 
and his face was freckled. 

“Hoy,” he said. “What’s the mat- 
ter with you?^^ 

Ron stared back wordlessly. 

“You sick or something?” the 
boy said, edging into the room. 

“No.” His own voice, strange 
and reedy, frightened him. “No, 
I’m all right.” 

“Andy!” A tall man with a 
frowning face appeared behind the 
boy. “Come on, fella. Let’s not 
waste any time.” He looked at Ron. 
“You the new chap?” 

“Yes.” 

“Feel well enough for some 
breakfast?” 

“I guess so.” 

“Fine. Then get some clothes on 
and come along.” 

“Hoy,” the freckle-faced boy said 
curiously. “You play airball?” 
“That’s enough of that.” The 
man paddled the boy’s rump. “Get 
along, Andy. You’ll have plenty of 
time to get acquainted later.” 

The boy giggled and ran down 
the hall. Ron got out of bed slowly, 
and walked towards the under- 
sized clothing that was draped on 
a nearby chair. He slipped into a 
gray coverall and said: “Listen — 
can I talk to you?” 

The man looked at his watch. 
“Well ... all right, I suppose. But 

HENRY SLESAR 




only for a minute. I promised the 
boys a game this morning; I’m Mr, 
Larkin, the athletic director.” 

Ron hesitated. “Mr. Larkin, I — 
where am I?” 

“Don’t you know?” Even the 
man’s smile was half a frown. 
“You’re at Roverwood Home for 
Boys. Didn’t they tell you that?” 
“No,” Ron said carefully. “I — 
I don’t seem to remember very 
much. How I got here, I mean.” 
“Dr. Minton brought you in last 
evening. He’s one of our directors.” 
“Oh.” Ron laced on the tiny 
scuffed shoes. “And where’s Dr. 
Minton now?” 

“Gone back to the city. He’s a 
busy man. Hear they’ve got him 
working on some big government 
project. Well, come on, Ronnie. 
Breakfast’s waiting.” 

“Yes, sir,” Ron Carver said. 

He followed the tall man down 
the hall, having trouble guiding 
the short stumpy legs that were now 
his own. They entered a communal 
dining room, filled with the clatter 
of dishes and the laughter of boys. 
He was brought to a long table and 
seated beside Larkin. The other 
boys greeted him with only mild 
interest, but the freckle-faced youth 
at the other end dropped him a 
broad wink. 

He ate sparingly, choking on the 
food, his mind working. It was the 
longest nightmare of his life, and 
the moment of awakening seemed 
too far off for comfort. 

Then Larkin was standing up 
and rattling a spoon against a water 
glass. 

“Fellas,” he said, “all those in- 
terested in this morning’s airball 

BRAINCHILD 



game will assemble on the field in 
half an hour after breakfast. Please 
don’t volunteer unless you’re able 
to handle a PF. Everybody else is 
invited to see the game.” 

He sat down, amid cheers. He 
smiled sadly at Ron, and asked: 
“How about you, Ronnie? Can you 
operate a PF?” 

“Of course,” he answered, with- 
out thinking. He’d been using Per- 
sonal Flyers since he was old 
enough to dream about flight. On 
his tenth birthday, his father had 
bought him one of the earliest 
models, a cumbersome machine 
then called a “platform”. Since 
that day, he had become familiar 
with every man-made thing that 
flew, from the double-rotored 
PF’s to the sixty-rocket space liners. 

“Fine,” Larkin said cheerfully. 
“Then maybe you’d like to play the 
game.” 

Ron Carver looked up sharply. 
Play the game . 

“Sure, Mr. Larkin,” he said, 
forcing his eagerness. 

Haff an hour later, they were as- 
sembled on the huge lawn outside 
of the main building of Roverwood 
Home for Boys. The long row of 
PF’s, looking like chrome-plate pot- 
bellied stoves, gleamed in the 
morning sun. The boys began to 
run when they saw their Flyers, 
and Ron found his arm taken by 
the freckled youth who had entered 
his room. 

“Hoy,” he said. “Follow me. I’ll 
pick you out a lively one!” 

The redhead clambered inside a 
machine marked Seven, and Ron- 
nie followed his instructions by 
choosing the vehicle marked Nine. 

43 




They secured themselves inside, 
and tested the jet tube set in front 
of the Flyer. The boys took off from 
the ground in perfect unison, the 
redhead bellowing out an intro- 
duction over the sound of the wind 
roaring past their ears. 

The PF’s descended on a blast 
from Mr. Larkin’s whistle, con- 
gregating in the center of the field. 
Teams were chosen, and Andy was 
picked as Captain of the Odds. 
A coin was tossed to decide the 
playing sequence, and they were 
ready. 

Larkin released the first airball, 
and the two teams streamed up 
after it. Andy gunned the engine 
and reached the ball first. He sent 
it scooting thirty yards ahead of 
him with the blast of the airjet 
pipe, but a member of the Evens 
team was there to veer it off to the 
left. Another Evens man, a burly 
youth of fourteen, took command 
of it, neatly getting the airball in 
the sight of his airjet and cork- 
screwing it towards the goalpost. 
Ron had grown too old before the 
game of airball had become pop- 
ular with the nation’s youngsters, 
but he had seen enough action to 
have learned some tricks. He 
pointed his PF directly for the 
Even machine, and kept coming. 
The burly youth looked up, startled 
at the onslaught, and pulled his 
Flyer away. The fact that the PF’s 
were magnetically collision-proof 
didn’t matter; it was pure instinct. 
Ron captured the ball in his air- 
jet pipe, and shouted for Andy to 
block his path towards the goal. 

The Odds scored, and the two 
teams descended for a rest. Andy, 



the grin wide on his brown-spotted 
face, said: “You’re okay, Ronnie! 
Hoy, I mean it. You’re okay!” 

“Thanks,” Ron said. He found 
himself panting. 

The game resumed. It ended in 
a 3-2 score, favor of the Odds. 
Andy and Ron were cheered as they 
left the Flyers and headed for the 
communal showers of the Rover- 
wood Home for Boys. 

In the stall, Ron Carver looked 
down at the spindly frame that was 
now his body, and began to weep. 
Andy heard him, but said nothing. 
Then they dressed and ambled 
back to the main house, sharing the 
awkward silence of new friends. 

Finally, the older boy said: “I 
don’t mean to butt in, Ronnie. But 
is somethin’ the matter?” 

“I — I don’t know, Andy. I’m all 
mixed up. I don’t even know how 
I got here.” 

“That’s easy. Dr. Minton 
brought you.” 

“But where is he now, Andy? 
Dr. Minton? It’s very important 
that I see him.” 

Andy shrugged. “Not much 
chance of that. Dr. Minton only 
comes around once, twice a year. 

“But I have to see him! Right 
away! Will they call him for me?” 

“Gosh. I don’t think so. He’s 
some kind of big shot in the govern- 
ment now.” 

They flopped on the grass, and 
Andy tore out a ragged clump and 
chewed on it blankly. Ron said: 
“Andy, I’m in trouble. I need some 
help.” 

“No kidding?” 

“Yes!” He brought his voice to 
a whisper. “Andy — what if I told 

HENRY SLESAR 



44 




you that I was really — ” He 
stopped, and examined the open, 
innocent face in front of his eyes. 
He knew that it would be useless 
to tell the truth. “Skip it,” he said. 

“I don’t get you. What’s on your 
mind, Ronnie?” 

“Nothing, Andy. I just have to 
get away from here.” 

“But you can’t. I mean, not until 
they let you. It’s the rules.” 

“Andy — how long have you been 
here?” 

The boy thought a moment. “Al- 
most nine years,” he said blissfully. 
“Since my folks got killed.” 

“How long do you have to stay?” 
“Why, ’til I’m old enough to 
work. Eighteen, I guess.” 

Only six years to go, Ron 
thought sourly. 

He stood up. 

“Andy — ^where do they put the 
PF’s?” 

“In the shed.” 

“Is it possible to get one out?” 

“ ’Course not. Only when we 
play the game.” 

“And when will we play another 
game?” 

“Dunno. Tomorrow maybe. It’s 
Sunday.” 

Play the game, Ron said to him- 
self. 

The Evens team member caught 
the spinning, gas-filled airball in 
the path of his airjet and kept it 
moving in front of his Flyer. Andy 
was after him in a flash, shouting 
for Ron to join him. But Ron’s dar- 
ing tactics of yesterday seemed to 
have deserted him. He steered the 
PF out of the path of the Evens 
man, and the goal was scored. 

BRAINCHILD 



On the ground, Andy said : 
“What’s the trouble, Ronnie? 
Didn’t you hear me?” 

“Yes, I heard you. Andy, listen. 
I’m taking off — ” 

“Sure, in just a minute,” the 
freckled boy said. “But, look, the 
next time you see me cut across 
the—” 

“You don’t understand!” Ron 
said intensely. “I’m running away!” 
“What?” 

Larkin’s whistle sounded the 
signal to resume play. The airball 
shot into the sky, and the two 
teams sped after it. Andy was late 
getting started. He looked at Ron 
and gasped: “You can’t do that — ” 
But Ron Carver was already in 
flight, and his PF was heading away 
from the center of the action, head- 
ing over the jagged pinetree tops 
that surrounded the Roverwood 
Home for Boys, heading for the 
misty green hills beyond. 

Larkin saw what was happening, 
and he blew his whistle shrilly. The 
teams descended, thinking a foul 
had been called. Larkin shouted a 
command towards the burly youth 
who had played so aggressively the 
day before, but then realized it 
was far too late to stop the swift 
passage of the PF now disapp>earing 
behind the trees. 



R on dropped the PF to earth 

as soon as his eyes sf)otted the 
first sign of a settled community. 
He landed the small machine in 
the shadow of a hillside, and 
dragged it into the thick under- 
brush for concealment. Then he 
trekked to the main highway, until 

45 




he reached a road sign that in- 
formed him of his location. He was 
in a town called Spring Harbor, 
just fifteen miles outside of the 
city. 

He looked down at the waxy 
newness of his gray Roverwood 
coverall, and wondered if it was 
a familiar uniform to the residents. 
But he had to take the chance. He 
covered the cloth with dust, and 
rolled up the trouser legs almost to 
his knees. Then he broke off a long 
branch from a sapling and used it 
as a walking stick. Casually, he 
strolled into the town proper. 

The pose worked. Some people 
on the porches looked after him 
with mild curiosity, but no one 
stopped him. Then he paused at 
a gas station, and asked the owner 
of the automatic pump if there was 
transportation available to the city. 

The owner scratched his face 
and looked at the boy curiously. 
Ron told a plausible story about 
being separated from a scouting 
group, and the man seemed satis- 
fied. He had a pick-up copter go- 
ing into the city at ten o’clock; he 
invited Ron to wait inside his 
house, and even served him a sand- 
wich. 

The copter pilot, a genial red- 
faced man, asked him some gentle 
questions. Ron answered them 
guardedly, and told him that his 
destination was Fordham Terrace. 
The copter dropped him on the 
rooftop of the massive office 
building, and the pilot left with a 
friendly wave of his hand. 

When he was gone, Ron rolled 
down his trouser legs, brushed his 
uniform clean, and descended to 

46 



the fourteenth floor of the build- 
ing. He walked rapidly along the 
corridors until he came to the door 
marked : 

WILFRED G. MINTON, M.D. 

He rattled the knob. When he 
found the door locked, he let out 
an adult oath. It was Sunday, of 
course. Dr. Minton wouldn’t be in 
on Sunday. And Ron had never 
known his home address. 

He returned to the elevator and 
went to the ground floor. There 
was an information booth, and 
the woman behind the glass was 
a motherly type. Her eyes softened 
at his approach. 

“Dr. Minton?” she said, lifting 
an eyebrow. “Why, I guess I do 
have his adress. But who sent you, 
young man?” 

“Nobody,” Ron said. “I was sup- 
posed to see him, that’s all.” 

She kept her eyes on his face 
while her hand leafed through the 
directory on her desk. “Of course. 
Dr. Minton doesn’t use his office 
anymore. He gave up his practice 
here almost a year ago. He was put 
on an important government proj- 
ect. Dr. Jurgens, his assistant, 
handles all his patients now. Would 
you like Dr. Jurgens’ number?” 
“No,” Ron said. “Please. I must 
see Dr. Minton.” 

“All right. But I don’t know if 
you can see him without an 
appointment. He’s staying at the 
Government Medical Center in 
Washington.” She smiled. “That’s 
a long way for a little boy . .” 
“Thank you,” Ron said curtly, 
and walked off. 



HENRY SLESAR 




His mind was racing, tripping 
over his thoughts. A year ago! But 
that was impossible! It seemed only 
days since he had returned from 
Andromeda, after a five-year ab- 
sence. One of his first visits had 
been to Dr. Minton’s office — not 
just to renew an old friendship, but 
to allow the physician to examine 
him thoroughly for traces of the 
varied and deadly diseases that 
man was subject to on alien worlds. 
Could it have been a whole year 
ago? Where had he spent the time 
between? And what had happened 
to give him the body of a twelve- 
year-old child? 

He fought off the questions. 

He had no time for the puzzle now; 
there weren’t enough pieces to 

make sense. He had only one 

thought: to find the doctor. 

But that was a major problem 
all by itself. Washington was a 
good hour away by fast copter serv- 
ice. And in this big, suspicious 

city, it wouldn’t be as easy to obtain 
free transport to his destination. 
He could do nothing — ^not with- 
out money. 

When he thought of money, he 
thought of Adrian. 

Adrian . 

Of course! Adrian would know 
what to do next. Adrian always 
seemed to know what to do. Her 
father’s money had opened every 
conceivable door in this city, and 
she herself had often suggested 
that it open doors for him. Doors 
to the executive heights of the 
Space Transport Company. Doors 
to the plush offices in the sky tower, 
doors to the select circle of cigar- 
smoking men who controlled the 

BRAINCHILD 



transportation empire of which 
Ron had been only a spare part. 
But Ron Carver had been young 
(he thought now, sourly) and his 
head had been stuffed with ideals. 
He detested the groundworms who 
stayed home and counted the 
profits of space travel. He wanted 
the stars. 

So he had become a pilot, one 
of the best in her father’s fleet. She 
had sworn at him for his decision, 
and turned away from his embrace. 
But on the night of their parting, 
the night before the dawn ascent 
towards the speck of light that was 
Andromeda, she had softened, and 
cried in his arms. 

He thought now of that moment, 
and his small fingers rolled into 
fists. 

Adrian, he thought. I must go to 
her . 

The doorman was magnificent 
and imposing in his braided uni- 
form, but his eyes were cold when 
he saw Ron. 

“What do you want, son?” 

“I — I have a message for Miss 
Walder. It’s very important.” 

“Okay, son. You just give your 
message to me.” 

“No! I’m supposed to deliver it 
in person!” 

The doorman grunted. “Wait a 
minute.” He put in a call to the 
penthouse apartment. The idea of 
a twelve-year-old visitor must have 
amused the girl. He brought back 
an invitation for Ron to enter her 
home. 

Ron stepped off the elevator, and 
his stomach was churning. What 
would she say when she saw him? 
Would she believe his story? Would 

47 




she help him find an answer? 

Adrian came to the door herself, 
and the amusement was evident on 
her long, smoothly-planed face. 
Her auburn hair was swept back 
in Grecian ringlets, and the gown 
she wore was blindingly white. 
‘‘Come in, dear,” she said, smiling. 

The effect of looking up at the 
girl, now a sort of giantess in his 
eyes, made Ron dizzy. He swayed 
against the doorframe, and her 
cool fingers steadied him. 

“You poor boy,” she crooned. 
“Come inside.” 

She half-carried him to the 
downy sofa. For a full minute, he 
was too choked to speak. She 
offered him a glass of milk, but he 
asked for water. She brought some 
to him, and he coughed. 

“Now,” the girl said, spreading 
the wide skirt over her knees, “just 
what was it you wanted to tell 
me?” 

“Come now.” She smiled endear- 
ingly, and brushed back the hair 
from his forehead. “You must have 
had something on your mind.” 

“Yes,” he said at last, his voice 
strained. “Yes, Adrian. I — I’m 
Ron . .” 

“What?” 

“Fm Ron Carver! No, listen. 
I’m not mad. It’s really me, Ron!” 

She had stood up, shocked. Then 
she laughed. 

“Adrian, listen to me! Something 
happened to me when I returned 
from Andromeda. I don’t know 
what. I found myself at a boy’s 
home near Spring Harbor.” 

“Now, really! This is the crazi- 
est—” 

48 



“I know it’s crazy!” He wiped 
his forehead in an adult gesture. 
“But it’s true, Adrian. I’ve been — 
changed somehow. I don’t know 
why. But it’s something to do with 
Dr. Minton.” 

She sat down again, limply. 
Then she studied his face, and for 
a moment, Ron thought she was 
seriously considering his predica- 
ment. But then the laugh started 
again, the same slightly off-key 
laugh Ron remembered. 

“Adrian, you must believe me! I 
can prove it! Just listen to me for 
a moment!” 

She stopped the laugh and grew 
serious, her eyes caught by the 
intensity of his own. “All right,” 
she whispered. “I’ll listen . .” 

“My name is Ronald Carver. 
I’m thirty years old. I’m a Captain 
of the Walder Space Transport 
Company. I have been in the An- 
dromeda system for the past five 
years. I returned to Earth — ” he 
stopped, and swallowed hard. “I 
don’t know exactly when. I went to 
see Dr. Minton, an old friend and 
a physician. He examined me, and 
then—” 

She stared, fascinated. 

“And then I was a child! A child 
of twelve, in a home for boys. I 
ran away from there this morning, 
and came looking for Dr. Minton. 
I’ve been told that he’s in Washing- 
ton. I must get to him. I must find 
out what’s happened to me — ” 

She was shaking her head, slowly, 
eyes still fixed on his face. He got 
up from the sofa and came towards 
her. His small hand reached out 
and patted the fine bones of hers. 

“You must remember,” he said. 

HENRY SLESAR 




“You must believe me, Adrian. Re- 
member our last night together? 
Right here? We stood by that win- 
dow, and you cried in my arms. 
And then we . , 

She tore her hand away, as if 
burned. Then she stood up, look- 
ing horrified. 

“Get out of here!” she shrieked. 
“You little monster!” 

“Adrian — ” Only now did he 
realize what it must have been like 
to her, to hear those words from 
his childish lips, to feel the touch 
of his tiny hand as he spoke of the 
night they . , 

“Get out!” she cried, covering 
her face. “Get out before I call the 
police!” 

“Adrian!” 

She screamed, piercingly. This 
time, the sound brought heavy foot- 
side clumping outside her front 
door. It was thrown open, and a 
uniformed man with bouncing 
epaulets was striding towards him. 

“No,” Ron said. “You must 
listen — 

“Get him out of here!” 

“Sure, Miss Walder!” 

He struggled in the big man’s 
grip, while the girl turned her head 
aside. He managed to squirm from 
his hold, and broke for the door. 
The houseman started after him, 
cursing. Ron’s hand went out and 
grasped a solid metal ash tray. He 
threw it without thought or aim, 
but it crashed squarely into the 
man’s face and sent him thudding 
to the carpet. 

Adrian screamed again. He 
looked at her once more, implor- 
ingly. Then he ran for the door, 
just before she reached for the 

BRAINCHILD 



house telephone. 

In the elevator cage, he punched 
the button marked roof, and fell 
against the wall, panting. 

On the rooftop, he galloped 
across the metallic surface towards 
the ledge. He peered over it, and 
his heart sank when he saw that 
his stratagem had deceived no one. 
Police were entering the building, 
and some were pointing fingers in 
his direction. With a sigh, he 
dropped to his knees and rested his 
head against the cool aluminum 
surface. 

“It’s no use,” he said aloud. 

Then he heard the copter over- 
head. 

He looked up, thinking it was 
a police vehicle. But then he saw 
the outmoded design of its fuse- 
lage, and the young face at the 
controls. 

It hovered over his head, and a 
rope ladder unfolded. The youthful 
pilot said: “Quick! Climb in!” 

He blinked at the voice, unbe- 
lievingly. Then he scrambled to 
his feet, and grabbed the dangling 
ladder. He barely made it into the 
copter; the pilot had to help. 

“Who are you?” he said, gasp- 
ing. 

The boy laughed. “I hate cops, 
too.” 

Then they were in the air, and 
speeding towards the west. 



R on CARVER watched the 
back of the young boy’s neck 
for twenty minutes, while he steered 
the ancient copter expertly across 
the skies. He figured that the boy 
might have been fourteen or fifteen, 

49 




but there was a competence in the 
way his hands moved over the con- 
trols, and a steeliness in the way his 
head sat on his thin neck. 

They didn’t make much conver- 
sation, but Ron gathered that the 
boy was a member of something 
called the Red Rockets, an organ- 
ization with some inexplicable pur- 
pose. 

It was only after the copter had 
landed on the roof of a half-de- 
cayed slum in the worst part of 
town, that Ron realized who the 
Red Rockets were. They were kids, 
all of them, banded together for 
mutual defense and in common 
antagonism toward the world. 
When he clambered out of the 
copter, his rescuer grinned and 
said: 

“This is it, pal. This is where 
the gang meets.” 

“The Red Rockets?” 

“Yeah. This is Shock’s house. 
He’s the leader.” 

They had to descend by stairs; 
there was no building elevator. 
When they reached die second 
floor, the boy put a finger to his 
lips, and rapped one-two, two-two 
on the apartment door. 

A boy no older than Ron’s new 
body opened it. His dark pinched 
face grew smaller and darker when 
he saw the stranger. He looked 
back into the room before letting 
them in. 

The room was a study in decay. 
Someone had once wallpapered it 
in an optimistic pink pattern that 
was now sardonic in the surround- 
ings. The furniture was rudimen- 
tary, and there were no working 
light fixtures. A battery lamp was 

50 



sitting in the middle of a wooden 
table, and three youngsters were 
playing with a ragged deck of 
cards. 

The tallest of them arose when 
the newcomers entered. He was 
the only one wearing a jacket; the 
others were in shirtsleeves. His hair 
was black, and unruly to the point 
of being ludicrous. His wide mouth 
twisted when he spoke. 

“Who’s this?” he said. “What’s 
the idea?” 

“He’s okay,” Ron’s protector 
said. “He’s an okay kid. I spotted 
him on a rooftop down on Park. A 
million cops after him. I dropped 
down in the copter and picked him 
up.” 

The tall boy studied Ron’s face. 
“What’s your name?” 

“Ron.” 

“What were the cops chasin’ you 
for?” 

Ron hesitated. “Any of your 
business?” 

The tall boy smiled. “Maybe 
not.” He looked towards the others, 
and winked as if pleased. “Guess 
he’s okay.” He held his right hand 
out to Ron, while his left ducked 
into his jacket pocket. “My name’s 
Shock, pal. And I’m the leader 
here. And just so’s you don’t for- 
get it—” 

Pain lanced through Ron’s arm 
and struck the base of his skull. He 
tried to free himself from the tall 
boy’s grip, but his fingers wouldn’t 
part from the other’s flesh. He 
dropped to his knees in agony, until 
the grip was broken. 

He looked up, his face damp. 

“That’s your ’nitiation,” the tall 
boy grinned. “Now you know what’s 

HENRY SLESAR 




whatj Ronnie boy. So if you want 
to join the Rockets, you’ll know 
where your orders come from.” 
Shock helped him to his feet. 
“Right, Ronnie boy?” 

Ron shook his head, still bewild- 
ered. 

“Good deal,” Shock said. “Now 
let’s finish that game. You play, 
kid?” 

“No,” Ron said. He staggered to- 
wards a wooden chair on the side 
of the room and dropped on it 
heavily. “No,” he repeated, still 
trying to regain his breath. 

Play the game . 

His rescuer sat beside him. 
“Don’t mind that guy,” he whis- 
pered. “He does that to everybody. 
He got some kind of a power in his 
hands. But he’s not a bad guy, 
Honest.” 

“Sure,” Ron said weakly. 

“We get a lot of kicks,” the boy 
said eagerly. “You’ll see. We have 
dogfights with the other gangs. 
With copters. We only got one, that 
ain’t so much. But we’re figurin’ 
on gettin’ some PF’s next year, if 
we can collect enough dough in 
the treasury . .” 

“That’ll be great,” Ron said. 
Then he dropped his hand on the 
other’s arm. “Listen — is there any 
chance of takin’ a trip? In the 
copter?” 

“Yeah, sure,” the boy said 
warily. “Only you gotta ask for it 
in advance. I mean, it’s Rocket 
property, and you gotta sign for it. 
And even then, if Shock wants to 
use it — ^well . .” 

“Why?” Ron said. “Why’s that? 
Because he’s the leader?” 

“Sure,” the boy said simply. 

BRAINCHILD 



“That’s the reason.” 

Ron looked across the room at 
the card players. 

“How do you get to be the lead- 
er?” 

“I dunno. Shock’s the leader 
’cause he can lick anybody in the 
Rockets. That makes sense, don’t 
it?” 

“Yes. I suppose so.” He chewed 
his lip. “Listen. Let’s say I was 
leader. Could I use the copter 
then? Any time I wanted?” 

“Sure. I mean, if you’re the lead- 
er, who’s gonna stop you?” 

“Yes,” Ron said. He stood up 
and walked to the table, watching 
the cards as they were slapped on 
the wood. 

“Hey, Shock,” he said. 

The tall boy didn’t look up. 
“What is it?” 

“You cheat.” A thrill ran 
through Ron’s new body as he said 
it, and he muttered a small prayer 
that his guess about Shock’s power 
was correct. 

“I what?^^ 

“I’ve been watching you play, 
and you cheat. You don’t even 
cheat good. You cheat sloppy.” 

The tall boy stood up slowly, 
and the other chairs were scraped 
back in anticipation. 

“Now that’s something,” he 
said. “That’s really something! 
The kid’s here ten minutes, and 
right away he wants to be buried.” 
His face became grim. “Boy, we’ve 
had ’em wise before, pal. But never 
like this.” 

Ron planted himself in front of 
him, 

“So?” he said. 

Shock’s face clouded. “Say, are 

51 




you kidding? You really like 
trouble that bad?” 

His right hand lashed out, while 
the left headed for his jacket 
pocket. But it wasn’t the right that 
Ron avoided. Both of his short 
arms shot out towards the tall boy’s 
left, and stopped the descent of the 
arm. Shock’s right hand thudded 
against Ron’s shoulder, the blow 
only stinging him. 

“Hey!” Shock cried, “Hey, 
you — ” 

It was a triumph for Ron, He 
had been right about the electrical 
circuit woven through Shock’s 
clothing, the circuit he couldn’t 
complete without his left hand 
tripping the mechanism in his 
pocket. With the power off, Shock’s 
weapon was useless. He was caught 
by surprise, and Ron’s quick-mov- 
ing hands tumbled him to the floor. 

Before he had a chance to do 
anything else, Ron was upon him 
with an upraised chair. He closed 
his eyes before he swung. The 
sound of the crash might have 
sickened him in other circum- 
stances; now it sounded good and 
satisfying. 

Ron looked around the room, 
panting. 

“I’m the leader now,” he said. 
“Understand? I’m the leader!” 

The looked at each other uncer- 
tainly. 

“I’m taking the copter for a 
while,” Ron said, backing towards 
the door. “Any arguments?” 

Nobody answered. 

“Swell. So long, pals.” 

Outside the door, he ran all the 
way back to the roof and was off 
before the gang could follow. 



The trip took almost two hours. 
Even Ron’s experienced guidance 
of the controls couldn’t push the 
old copter past its limits, and he 
was keeping a worried eye on the 
fuel gauge. It was with a sigh of 
relief that he dropped the vehicle 
atop a public parking station in 
the downtown district, within walk- 
ing distance of the Government 
Medical Center. 

The sun was dropping fast, and 
the Washington streets were still 
filled with Sunday sightseers who 
found nothing odd in the sight of 
a solitary twelve-year-old. When 
he entered the enormous U-shaped 
edifice that housed a hundred and 
one government medical projects, 
he was thinking fast about a plaus- 
ible story for the receptionist. The 
best he could do was: 

“I’m looking for Dr. Wilfred 
Minton. He — he’s my uncle.” 

“Dr. Minton?” She was young, 
and the efficient type. “I’m sorry, 
but Dr. Minton’s been on special 
assignment for some time. It’s not 
easy to locate him.” 

“Oh, I know about that,” Ron 
said airily. “But I was supposed to 
see him today. You see, my mom 
— ^his sister that is — she was in a 
very bad accident . .” He swal- 
lowed hard, wondering if he was 
being believed. 

The woman frowned. “Well, if 
it’s an emergency, I suppose I 
could check with central control. If 
it’s really important.” 

“Oh, it’s important, all right!” 
He said this with great conviction. 

‘^ery well, then.” She picked 
up her telephone, and there was 
much transferring from party to 

HENRY SLESAR 



52 




party. Finally, she lowered the re- 
ceiver, saying: “He’s in the east 
wing. It’s Security territory, so I’ll 
have to see about a pass.” 

It took another ten minutes for 
her to locate the authority she was 
seeking. A young man with crinkly 
hair and a grim expression came 
briskly to the desk, asked him a 
few questions, and then signed his 
name on a document. Ron put the 
paper into the pocket of his cover- 
alls, and followed the man to a 
bank of private elevators. 

The man waved him inside one, 
and he couldn’t resist a wide-eyed 
question. 

“Gosh, mister. Are you from the 
FBI?” 

The man couldn’t conceal a 
small pleased grin. “That’s right, 
son. Only you keep it a secret.” 

“Sure,” Ron said. When the 
door closed and the elevator as- 
cended, he grinned too. Being 
twelve had its advantages some- 
times. 

He got off the elevator, and a 
uniformed guard checked his 
paper and led him into an ante- 
room. 

“You wait here, son,” he said, 
and left. 

Ron waited five minutes. When 
nothing happened, he tried an ad- 
joining door. It was open. He 
stepped inside the next room, and 
saw that it was a bare room with 
nothing but a row of filing cabinets 
and an abandoned swivel chair 
with a definite list to port. 

He went to the files and peered 
at the designation cards. 

They read: 

PROJECT SCHOLAR. 
BRAINCHILD 



He shrugged, and tried to open 
the top file. It was locked. He tried 
the o^ers, with no better luck. 

Then he heard the voices in the 
anteroom. 

For some reason, he sensed dan- 
ger. He knew he shouldn’t be in 
the file room, that if he were found 
his visit to Dr. Minton might come 
to a sudden end. He couldn’t take 
the chance. He tiptoed to the front 
door of the file room and turned 
the knob. He slipped out, and ran 
on his toes down the empty corri- 
dor. 

Quickly, without thought of the 
consequence, Ron opened still an- 
other door and closed it behind 
him. 

He looked at the shining brass 
fixtures and ultra modern appli- 
ances, and wondered what a 
kitchen was doing in a government 
medical building. Then, when he 
heard a sound in the adjoining 
room, he reasoned that he had 
stumbled into someone’s living 
quarters. 

He went to a brown mahogany 
door and pushed against it gently, 
until he widened the crack suffi- 
ciently to make out the figure walk- 
ing up and down in the other room. 

When the man crossed his line 
of vision, Ron’s breath tumbled out 
in a gasp. 

It was his own body. His thirty- 
year-old body, with its six-foot-two 
frame of big bones and long mus- 
cles, its sandy, close-cropped hair, 
its brooding eyes and full mouth. 
It was Ron Carver. It was himself 
as he had been before. 

“Here’s the little rascal,” a voice 
said behind him. 

53 





T he CRINKLY-haired 
took his arm roughly. 

“Okay, kid. Let’s hear it.” 

“Hear what?” Ron said plain- 
tively. “I wasn’t doing anything!” 
“Sure,” the guard sneered. “He 
wasn’t doin’ a thing. Just snoopin’ 
around, that’s all.” 

The swinging door opened. 
“What’s going on here?” 

Ron Carver looked at himself ; at 
his own face, now strange and 
stony; at his own eyes, now bright 
and disinterested ; at his own 
mouth, now a thin line of discon- 
tent. He heard his own voice, in a 
dangerous inflection he had never 
known before. 

“Sorry, sir,” the guard said, red- 



man dening. “Didn’t know you were in- 
side. Wouldn’t have disturbed 
you — ” 

“How did he get here?” 

“Gosh, sir, I really don’t know. 
He says he was lookin’ for Dr. Min- 
ton—” 

“Minton,” Ron Carver’s voice 
said. “Yes, of course. He would be 
looking for Minton, wouldn’t he?” 
“Sir?” 

“Never mind. Bring the boy into 
my quarters. Then get Dr. Minton 
up here at once.” 

“Yes, sir!” 

They pushed the swinging door 
open and shoved Ron ahead of 
them. The room was an anomaly 
in this pristine government build- 






ing, a warm room of deep-colored 
woods and thick carpeting. He was 
placed in a leather chair, his feet 
not touching the floor. The two 
men exited, and Ron Carver’s body 
walked to an oaken desk and sat in 
the padded swivel chair behind the 
blotter. 

“Well,” he said. “This is some- 
thing of a surprise for me.” 

“And how about me?” Ron said 
hoarsely. 

The man laughed. “Yes, we are 
both surprised. Was it Robert 
Burns? Yes, of course. ‘To see our- 
selves as others see us . ” He 

chuckled, and reached for a cigar- 
ette. “Filthy habit, this. Don’t know 
how I picked it up. Possibly a deep- 



seated trait of yours, Mr. Carver. 
Odd how these things can be trans- 
ferred.” 

The door opened again. 

“Dr. Minton!” Ron leaped to his 
feet. 

The doctor’s face went white be- 
hind the gray beard and moustache. 

“Then you’ve found him,” he 
said softly, to neither of them in 
particular. 

“No,” Ron Carver’s body an- 
swered. “I didn’t find him, doctor. 
Rather, he found us. Isn’t that 
right, Mr. Carver?” 

“Yes!” Ron said. “And now I 
want to know the truth!” 

“I, too, need answers,” the Ron- 
body said stiffly. “I need answers

at once, Dr. Minton. I would think 
this requires an explanation.” 

“I couldn’t do it,” the doctor 
whispered. “I couldn’t do what you 
wanted. Scholar.” 

“Do what?” Ron said. 

“All right, then,” the Ron-body 
said coldly. “You failed once. But 
you’re far too intelligent to make 
the same mistake twice. So you 
have your assignment. Dr. Minton. 
I will get you the help you need. 
But kill this — this remnant — ” 

He turned away in disgust, and 
picked up the telephone. He spoke 
under his breath for a few mo- 
ments, and then hung up. “Dr. 
Luther will be here in just a mo- 
ment. He’ll arrange things with the 
laboratory. It will all be very pain- 
less and quick.” 

Ron said: “What are you talk- 
ing about?” He looked wildly to- 
wards the old man, who had aged 
even further since entering the 
room. “Dr. Minton — ” 

The door opened. A brisk young 
man, carrying a small valise, ap- 
peared. 

“All set downstairs,” he said. 
“Good,” the Ron-body answered. 
“Then get it over with.” 

Ron struggled for a moment in 
the young man’s grip, but he found 
it iron. 

“Please, Ron.” Doctor Minton’s 
eyes were moist. “Don’t make any 
trouble. Please . * 

The laboratory was in the base- 
ment of the building, an antiseptic 
room with the acrid odor of chem- 
icals. Dr. Luther prepared some- 
thing in a hypodermic syringe, 
while Dr. Minton strapped his 

56 



former patient onto a padded ex- 
amining table. 

“Doctor . .” Ron whispered. 
“Hush, Ron. It’s all right . •” 
“But what is all this? Who am 
I?” 

The doctor frowned. “You’re 
Ronald Carver. You’re the same 
Ronald Carver you always were. 
But you have made an exchange 
of bodies. That is all.” 

“But why? How?” 

“I don’t really know. God help 
us. It was his project from start to 
finish — that thing upstairs.” 

“Who is he?” 

“A phenomenon. A mutation. A 
freak. A genius. A god. I can’t ex- 
plain him. He was born twelve 
years ago, to normal parents in the 
middle west. He was a recognized 
prodigy at the age of six months, a 
mathematical wizard at one, a 
scientific genius at three . You’ve 
heard of this kind of thing, Ron. 
Once a generation, something like 
this. And once a millenium — a hor- 
ror like this one.” 

“I don’t understand! What is 
Project Scholar?” 

“He is. All by himself. The gov- 
ernment has taken charge of his 
abilities, at least for the time be- 
ing.” He snorted. “He’s already 
done things I wouldn’t have be- 
lieved possible in five thousand 
years of evolution. And yet he is 
still only twelve years old . .” 
“Only twelve?” Ron squirmed in 
the straps. “Doctor! This body — 
“Yes, Ron. It’s his, of course. He 
grew angry with it; wanted to dis- 
card it, like everything else which 
doesn’t fit his conception of the 
fitness of things. It was awkward — 

HENRY SLESAR 




a giant’s brain in a child’s body. 
So he developed a solution — an 
operation, involving the total trans- 
ference of electrical energy . 

The doctor’s shaggy head bowed. 
“He needed human help for that. 
That’s when I was brought in as 
assistant. And it was my function 
to select the perfect body as a tem- 
porary house for his ego . 

“Temporary?” 

“When this body ages and grows 
feeble, there will be another. Our 
friend has outwitted Death itself.” 

The doctor looked up, his jaw 
firm. 

“I was instructed to destroy his 
body when the transference was 
completed. I couldn’t do it, Ron. 
I managed to spirit you away 
where you would be cared for. It 
was almost a year before you came 
to your senses after the operation. 
By that time, I didn’t know what 
to do with you. My first thought 
was the Roverwood Home, where 
I am a director, where you would 
be lost among many, many boys’ 
faces . .” 

“But why me, doctor? Why me?” 

“I had to choose someone, Ron. 
It was merely a question of 
who ...” 

Dr. Luther entered, priming the 
needle. 

“Ready?” he said. 

“One moment.” The doctor’s 
hand covered Ron’s mouth, and he 
felt the contours of a small round 
pill against his lips. He realized 
he was meant to swallow it, and he 
did. 

“Ready now,” Dr. Minton said. 

Dr. Luther performed the in- 
jection. 

BRAINCHILD 



“Good night, sweet prince,” he 
said gently. 

When Ron awoke, it was under a 
blanket of darkness and ice. 

He blinked until his eyes became 
accustomed to the impoverished 
light that was glowing behind a 
glass-paned door. 

He was on a block of some cold 
composition, in what must have 
been the Medical Center’s morgue. 
He reacted with revulsion at the 
thought, and leaped off. Then he 
saw that his left hand was holding 
a sheet of paper. He carried it to 
the meager light source and read it 
quickly: 

Ron — 

Don’t wait another moment. 
You’ll find a suit of clothes in 
the closet left. Leave through 
back stairway marked N. There 
is money in suit. Use it to leave 
the city. Do not return if you 
value your safety and the life of 

M. 

He found the clothes as directed, 
a neatly-cut suit of boy’s clothing, 
with a small wallet stuffed with 
bills amounting to three hundred 
dollars. He dressed rapidly, opened 
the door, and peered down the hall. 
It was empty as he ran silently 
towards the exit marked N. 

Now he was doubly in debt to 
Dr. Minton. But he couldn’t spare 
the doctor even now, for his life 
had been given a new direction 
and purpose. 

He was going to kill the Scholar. 
He walked rapidly through the 
dark streets towards the public 

57 




parking lot where the helicopter 
had been stored. He took the lift 
to the roof, and walked up to it 
quickly. 

“It’s about time, pal.” 

It was Shock, his hair tousled 
over his hard, bright eyes. There 
was a gun in his hand. 

“I’ve been waitin’ an hour, you 
punk. Think you were gettin’ off 
so easy?” 

“Look, Shock—” 

“You thought you were a clever 
boy, didn’t you? Well, I got news 
for you — ” 

“Look, I don’t want to be leader. 
I just needed a copter for a few 
hours.” 

“Yeah, sure. Only you forgot 
something. We put Finder equip- 
ment on this baby a long time ago, 
so we could keep tabs on it.” 

“You can have the copter — 

“I don’t want just the copter, 
Ronnie boy. I want to square a few 
things with you.” 

“Look, Shock. I’ll make a deal 
with you. I’ll give you two hundred 
bucks for that gun.” 

The tall boy’s face changed. 
“What?” 

“You heard me. You hand over 
that gun, I’ll give you two hundred 
dollars.” 

His eyes narrowed. “Then what? 
I suppose you’d shoot me and take 
off. Uh-uh, pal.” 

“You can check the gun down- 
stairs, and sell me the key.” 

“Okay,” Shock said slowly. “But 
if you’re pullin’ something — ” He 
balled his hands menacingly. 

They went down to the lower 
level together. Shock bought him- 
self a public locker, and shoved the 

58 



gun inside. Then he held up the 
key. 

“Here it is, pal. Two hundred 
bucks worth.” 

Ron handed him the money. 
Shock whistled at the sight of the 
bills. 

“Now,” Ron said. “Would you 
like to make a hundred more?” 
He looked at Ron with respect. 
“Okay. What’s the pitch?” 

“I want you to make a phone 
call for me.” 

“Yeah, sure.” Shock looked be- 
wildered. Then Ron explained. 

They reached the guard in the 
East Wing of the Medical Center 
without much difficulty. Shock 
crouched over the receiver and 
said: 

“This is Dr. Luther. Something’s 
happened; you better connect me 
with him” 

“Okay, hold on.” 

There was a wait. Then Ron 
Carver’s own voice, in its eerie new 
inflection, was on the other end. 
“What is it?” 

“This is Luther. Something’s 
happened down here. I think the 
boy got away.” 

“What? Where are you?” 

“In the morgue, downstairs. I 
think you better come down your- 
self.” 

“How could it happen?” The 
Ron-voice was raging. “How?” 

“I don’t know. But you better 
meet me here in ten minutes — ” 
Ron jabbed Shock in the side, 
and the tall boy slammed the re- 
ceiver back into place with a re- 
lieved sigh. 

“I don’t get it,” he said. “Who 
was that guy?” 



HENRY SLESAR 




“Me,” Ron said, with a grim 
smile. He handed Shock the money, 
and watched him depart, still look- 
ing baffled. Then he went to the 
locker and removed the gun, stuff- 
ing it inside his jacket. It bulked 
large against his narrow chest. 

He raced through the streets 
back to the medical center, heading 
for Exit N and the morgue. 



R on was waiting, gun 

poised, behind the empty slab. 
A shadow covered the dim light 
behind the glass-plated door, and 
the Ron-body entered the silent 
room. 

He saw his own hand reaching 
out to flick on the light switch. He 
saw his own face register dismay 
and annoyance at the quiet scene. 

Then the Ron-body turned and 
was about to leave. 

“Stay awhile,” Ron said. 

He stood up, revealing the weap- 
on, holding it in both of his small 
hands for firm control of the trig- 
ger. 

“Well,” his voice said. 

“Yes, well,” Ron answered. 
“Very well, thanks. Only I won’t 
speak for you. Scholar. Because I 
don’t think you’re well at all. I 
think you’re out of your mind . .” 
The Ron-lips curled. 

“Naturally. Genius is akin to 
madness. It’s one of the deep- 
rooted convictions of the human 
e^o. It reflects their suspicion, their 
distrust of the superintelligent . 
I understand you, Mr. Carver.” 
“And I don’t understand you! 
You’re something new to me. May- 
be you’re better than us, maybe 

BRAINCHILD 



you’re worse. I don’t know, Schol- 
ar. But that’s not why I’m going 
to kill you — ” 

“Oh?” 

“No! You think I want to kill 
you for the sake of the world? Be- 
cause you’re a menace to homo 
sapiens? Because of your contempt 
for us ordinary mortals? Hell, no. 
Scholar! I’m too ordinary myself. 
I’m killing you for for Ron 
Carver! Because I’m sore! Just 
plain sore!” 

He raised the gun. 

For a moment, Ron didn’t know 
what had happened. Something 
else blurred his vision, a fast-mov- 
ing figure bulking up in front of his 
target. It was only when he heard 
the voice that he recognized the in- 
truder as Dr. Minton, and he saw 
then that the doctor had rescued 
the Scholar from certain death. 
“Stop, Ron—” 

“Doctor! Get out of the way!” 
“No, Ron. You don’t know what 
you’re doing — ” 

The old man was shielding the 
Ron-body with his own. Ron put 
the weapon down. 

“But why?” he said 
“Because this is no answer! This 
is the assassin’s way — ” He turned 
to the Ron-body, and his voice was 
shaking. “Listen, Scholar. I want to 
arbitrate. Will you listen?” 

“Do I have a choice?” 

“Yes!” the doctor said fiercely. 
“Life or death! Will you listen to 
my terms?” 

The Ron-body shrugged. “All 
right.” 

“Very well. Then I want you to 
spare Ron Carver. I want you to

In the past year the Martian rebels had been 



pushed back to the wall. All that was left to 
them was Plan Blue. And what was Plan Blue . ? 



J ONNER’S HAND dropped to his pistol and he edged 
cautiously behind a big rock as another groundcar ap- 
peared among the dunes to the south and approached the 
little group of men. He was sure Sir Stanrich had told him 
there were to be four others in his little task force: and 
there were four with him now. 

But the new groundcar did not approach like a hostile 
patrol car. There was an air of confidence about the way its 
driver swung it up to the others. Jonner held his hand, 
thinking furiously, as the airtight door swung open and 
the newcomer leaped lightly to the ground. 

The sun was settling over the iron-red wastes of the 
Isidis Desert. The groundcars clustered like giant beetles 
at the top of the cliff that dropped straight down to the 
shadowed lowland of Syrtis Major. The six men in mar- 
suits, huddled at rendezvous, kept their helmet radios low, 
for Mars City was less than fifty miles east of them. 

With the twilight, the blue mist of Mars was beginning to 
settle toward the ground.

Jonner debated with himself. 
Could he have misunderstood Sir 
Stanrich? Or could the plans have 
been changed after he left the Isidis 
spaceport? No. Then who was the 
sixth man? And which man was he? 

“Regina fell right after I left/’ 
said the burly, gray-haired man. 
That would be Tyruss, the former 
space captain, who had come here 
from Regina. “Our troops were 
falling back along the Hadriacum 
Lowland. I suppose they plan to 
make a stand before Charax.” 

“No, Charax is to be evacuated 
tonight,” said Jonner, and savored 
the shock of that announcement 
on his hearers. 

He studied the credentials each 
man had handed him on arrival. 
There was Tyruss^ from Regina. 
There was Farlan, an astrogator 
from the Rebel defenses in the 
Strymon Canals, and there was 
Aron, who had just arrived, a 
space engineer from the Hadriacum 
front. There were Stein, an astro- 
gator, and Wessfeld, an engineer, 
who had come together in one 
groundcar from Charax. 

The credentials were all alike, 
except the names. But one of them 
was — ^must be — a Marscorp spy. 

Jonner could not check with Sir 
Stanrich by radio— Mars City was 
too close, and they would be over- 
heard. He had no time to spend 
investigating his personnel— Sir 
Stanrich had impressed on him that 
their mission must be carried out on 
schedule. 

He decided he would not tell 
them just yet that one of them 
could not be trusted. He might be 

62 



able to trip the spy. But he said: 

“One or more of us may be 
killed or captured, so Fm going to 
brief everyone. No matter how 
many of us are lost, those who are 
left must carry out the mission. 
What were you told about this?” 

“I was told to meet you here and 
follow your instructions. I was told 
it’s a dangerous and important as- 
signment. That’s all,” said Tyruss. 
The others murmured agreement. 

“The instructions I give you 
won’t be mine, but those of Sir 
Stanrich O’Kellin, supreme com- 
mander of the Rebel forces,” said 
Jonner. He squatted on the sand 
and the others crowded around in 
the blue twilight as he sketched 
diagrams with his gloved hand 
while he talked : 

“As some of you may have 
learned, the Charax Rebellion is 
in danger of collapsing, because 
our supplies have been running out 
since Marscorp intercepted and 
destroyed our last space fleet from 
Earth. Plan Red, which was our 
master plan for defeating Marscorp 
in the field by capturing the dome- 
cities one by one, has failed. Regina 
and Charax are being evacuated 
because we couldn’t hold them 
much longer anyway, and all our 
people are being transported 
around the Marscorp territory to 
the secret underground spaceport 
we established in the Isidis Desert 
two years ago. 

“This is a temporary measure, 
to prepare for Plan Blue, our last- 
gasp emergency plan. Marscorp 
will no doubt find the location of 
the underground base by observa- 
tion of the refugees, but we hope 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




to have Plan Blue in operation be- 
fore they can shift their forces from 
Hadriacum to the desert and break 
through our defenses.*’ 

“I’ve heard rumors of this Plan 
Blue,” said Parian, a slight man 
with blond hair. “What is it?” 

“I don’t know,” conceded Jon- 
ner candidly. “I don’t think any- 
one does but Sir Stanrich and a 
few of our top strategists. But our 
part of it is this: 

“You may not know it, but we 
lost our last G-boat when we pulled 
that unsuccessful attack on Phobos 
early this year. We do have an old 
spaceship, riding in a polar orbit, 
that Marscorp doesn’t know about, 
but no way to get up to it. Our 
job is to capture a Marscorp G- 
boat, get to that spaceship, capture 
The Egg and tow it into an Earth- 
ward orbit.” 

“The Egg?” repeated Stein, a 
dark, chubby fellow. “You mean 
tliat ovoid space station of Mars- 
corp’s with the antennae sticking 
out all over it? I’ve seen that thing 
floating up there. I always won- 
dered why we didn’t blast it.” 

“Not important enough,” said 
Jonner. “It’s an experimental lab- 
oratory that amplifies the magnetic 
field of Mars, and they’ve been 
experimenting with it as an auxil- 
iary power station. But neither side 
is bothered by any lack of power 
from the atomic energy sources on 
Mars.” 

Tyruss appeared annoyed at 
this. 

“Tell me something, Jonner,” he 
demanded. “If it wasn’t important 
enough to blast when we had the 
ships to do it, why is it important 

A CASE OF SUNBURN 



enough for us to capture now?” 

“I don’t know,” said Jonner. 
“Those are our orders. Now, we 
leave the groundcars here and go 
on foot to Marsport. Check equip- 
ment, everyone.” 

“Say,” commented Parian after 
a moment, “I don’t seem to have 
any sunburn lotion.” 

“You can have mine,” said Aron, 
laughing. “This far from the sun, 
I haven’t been sunburned yet, and 
don’t expect to be.” 

“Haven’t been on Mars a year 
yet, have you?” suggested Tyruss. 

“No,” admitted Aron. “I came 
from Earth with the last space 
fleet and escaped in a lifeboat. 
Why?” 

“There’s an Earth-sun conjunc- 
tion coming up. Every time the 
Earth swings between Mars and 
the sun, everybody on Mars gets 
a bad sunburn. When it comes, 
you better cover yourself with 
lotion, because clothes don’t pro- 
tect you and even if you’re in a 
city, the domes and house roofs are 
transparent to pick up the sun’s 
heat.” 

“We have enough among us,” 
said Jonner. “Besides, if our mission 
goes off on schedule, we’ll be back 
at base by the time the Earth-sun 
conjunction starts. Let’s head for 
Marsport,” 

The six men crouched in the 
concealing canal sage near the edge 
of Marsport, the spaceport outside 
Mars City. The blue mist was a 
heavy fog that swirled around 
them. 

In the lighted circle of the space- 
port area three stubby, two-stage 

63 




gravity-boats sat upright, about a 
hundred yards apart. These were 
the heavy duty rockets that plied 
back and forth to Phobos, Mars’ 
inner moon and Marscorp’s natural 
space station, entering the plane- 
tary atmosphere of Mars where 
spaceships could not go. Workmen 
stirred busily around one of the 
G-boats; a guard stood at the en- 
trance port of each of the other 
two. 

Jonner tried to assess the evi- 
dence, to decide which of his five 
companions was the Marscorp spy. 
How Marscorp had found out 
about the expedition, how the cre- 
dentials had been forged, how the 
rendezvous had been learned, did 
not matter now. Marscorp could 
not know their plans beyond the 
rendezvous in the desert, because 
only he and Sir Stanrich had 
known the orders Sir Stanrich had 
given him for this mission. 

The fact that Stein and Wessfeld 
had arrived together from Charax 
eliminated them as suspects, for the 
Charax command would have 
known whether one or two men 
were to be sent from there. 

Jonner did not believe Tyruss 
was the spy. Jonner had won his 
space papers just before the Rebel- 
lion began, but it was logical that 
Sir Stanrich would send a more ex- 
perienced space captain to handle 
their ship. 

That left Parian and Aron, from 
different sections of the Hadriacum 
front. Which one? In their special- 
ties, Parian was an alternate to 
Stein as an astrogator, Aron an al- 
ternate to Wessfeld as an engineer. 
But every spaceman could handle 

64 



every other spaceman’s duties in an 
emergency, and it was hard to say 
which task they had decided to 
double up on. 

Jonner expected the spy to make 
some move here, tonight, and he 
had prepared for it on the way 
from the desert. One earphone of 
his helmet receiver was tuned with 
his speaker to the Rebel band they 
used, the other was tuned to the 
local frequency used by Marscorp. 
Jonner listened with one ear to the 
occasional reports and orders that 
were passed around the spaceport. 

Jonner punched Tyruss, next to 
him, twice on the shoulder. It was 
the signal. The six men rose and 
moved forward together. 

The sentry who loomed before 
them had no chance. A heat-gun 
beam is invisible. They cut him 
down and scurried to the edge of 
the spaceport, into the circle of 
light, running in long leaps toward 
the nearest G-boat. 

It was as they broke from the 
canal sage that the thing happened 
which Jonner had expected. The 
words were shouted into the ear- 
phone attuned to the Marscorp 
band: “Attention, Marscorp! 

Att . 

Jonner pressed a button on his 
belt, and his other defense went 
into action. A scrambler beam cut 
in on the attempted warning, and 
everything on that channel dis- 
solved into a buzzing roar. 

Jonner cast a glance down the 
line of his companions, but they 
were too far separated for him to 
see whether any of them was talk- 
ing into his helmet microphone. 

Some of the workmen at the far 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




G-boat saw them running across 
the field, and scattered in alarm, 
but the scrambling prevented them 
from warning others through hel- 
met communicators. The guard at 
the G-boat that was their goal saw 
them when they were fifty feet 
away. He was cut down as he tried 
to duck around the G-boat. 

They ran up the ramp. Jonner, 
first to reach the port, stopped and 
tried to watch his companions as 
they hurried past him. Tyruss was 
fumbling at some control on the 
belt of his marsuit. His radio chan- 
nel control? 

Armed men were converging on 
the G-boat from all over the field 
as Jonner slammed and fastened 
the port. They scrambled up to the 
nose of the G-boat, and he and 
Tyruss sank into the pilots’ seats. 

“Strap down for blast-off!” 
shouted Jonner, and wished vicious- 
ly that the spy would still be tuned 
on the Marscorp band and fail to 
hear him. But everyone strapped 
down, hurriedly. 

A score of Marscorp soldiers 
were standing around the G-boat, 
firing up at its ports with heat- 
guns. The beams were futile, for G- 
boats were built to stand frictional 
temperatures it would take a heat- 
gun minutes to build to. Halfway 
across the field, a squad of men 
wheeled an anti-tank gun into posi- 
tion. 

The gentle gravity of Mars quad- 
rupled as the G-boat strained up- 
ward on roaring jets, gathering 
speed. Through the port, Jonner 
saw the anti-tank gun’s muzzle ele- 
vate and blossom flame. There was 
no impact; and there was no op- 

A CASE OF SUNBURN 



portunity for another shot. 

The G-boat curved eastward in a 
long ascending arc. The first stage 
dropped off over the Aerian Desert, 
and in a few moments they were in 
free fall. 



J ONNER UNSTRAPPED and 
floated to each man in turn, ex- 
amining his control belt. Farlan’s 
channel dial was a fraction off the 
band they used. 

“Parian, your radio control’s off 
center,” said Jonner quietly. 

“What?” said Farlan’s voice, 
blurred a little. He fumbled at the 
dial, and his words came in clearly. 
“Must have hit it against some- 
thing.” 

Or he could have missed a little 
when he returned the dial to chan- 
nel after trying to warn Marscorp. 
But Tyruss had been fumbling with 
something on his belt as they ran 
onto the G-boat. No, it wouldn’t do 
to make an accusation against the 
wrong man. 

An automatic calendar on the 
G-boat’s control board showed the 
date: upright, the Martian date, 
Aster 32, 24; reversed, the Earth 
date, June 1, 2020. 

Jonner looked down through the 
port at the inhabited hemisphere 
of Mars unfolding below them. 
Those green lowlands, those red 
deserts, now were all in Marscorp 
hands — even the cradle of the 
Charax Rebellion, the dome-city of 
Charax, at the edge of the edge of 
the Tiphys Fretum Lowland in the 
south polar area. 

There, six Martian years ago, the 
rebellion had flared bravely against 

65 




the Mars Corporation. Marscorp 
had held a monopoly on space 
travel between Earth and Mars 
since the first Martian colony was 
established at Mars City in the 
Earth year 1985. For the supplies 
Marscorp brought from Earth, the 
price was kept high. Marscorp also 
was the OGM — the Official Gov- 
ernment of Mars, or, as the col- 
onists read the initials, “Old 
Greedy Marscorp” — and Marscorp 
made and enforced the laws. 

It had been a fairly even match 
at first. Marscorp’s initial monopoly 
of the supply lines had been over- 
come when many of the people on 
Earth were roused to sympathy for 
the Rebel cause. Gradually, the 
Rebels had invested much of the 
Hadriacum Lowland with its dome- 
farms and had captured Regina, 
another of the planet’s six dome- 
cities. 

That had been before the dis- 
astrous space battle of the year 23. 
Now, in the past year, the Rebels 
had been pushed back to the wall. 
All that was left to them was Plan 
Blue. And what was Plan Blue? 

Jonner looked over his five com- 
panions. All helmets were off now, 
and Jonner couldn’t detect a guilty 
look in any face. He had never seen 
such pure unanimity of apparent 
innocence and loyalty. 

“Now that we’re aspace, we’ll go 
on the customary shifts,” he said: 
“eight hours duty, eight hours sleep, 
eight hours free time. We’ll pair 
off: Stein with Parian, Wessfeld 
with Aron, Tyruss with me. 

“And these are special orders: 
no one is to let the man with whom 
he is paired out of his sight” 



He would not tell them more 
than that now; he hoped to trap 
the spy when they approached The 

Egg. 

The spaceship slid up orbit, over- 
taking the shining ovoid from 
which antenhae sprouted like pins 
from a pin-cushion. The captured 
G-boat was lashed to the space- 
ship’s side. 

“You’d think they’d have some 
defenses, anyhow,” grumbled Ty- 
russ, watching the ovoid on the 
screen. 

“Why?” countered Jonner. 
“They knew we didn’t have any 
G-boats left, and they didn’t know 
we had any spaceships left, either. 
Of course, they don’t know this is 
our target, but I’ll bet they have 
some ships from Phobos on the way 
here now, anyhow.” 

Their timing was just right. 
Thirty minutes later The Egg 
would swing around the limb of 
Mars, in line of sight with Mars- 
port. But so far there had been no 
chance for The Egg to receive a 
radio warning of the stolen G-boat. 

The spaceship pulled abreast of 
The Egg and Jonner and Tyruss 
went across to it in spacesuits. They 
passed through the airlock to find 
The Egg’s crew of three waiting 
with welcoming smiles. The smiles 
faded at the sight of their levelled 
heat-guns. 

“Sorry you weren’t expecting 
us,” said Jonner, opening the face- 
plate of his spacesuit with his left 
hand. “You’ll have to get into 
spacesuits.” 

They sent their captives through 
the airlock and across the interven- 



66 



CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




ing space to the spaceship, where 
the others would be awaiting them. 
Then Jonner and Tyruss searched 
The Egg for other Marscorp per- 
sonnel. They found none. 

“We’d better get a line on her 
and get under way before those 
ships from Phobos can get here,” 
said Tyruss. 

“Right,” agreed Jonner, and 
they got busy. 

A towline secured between the 
two vessels, Jonner and Tyruss re- 
turned to the spaceship. The three 
Marscorp captives had been se- 
cured by chains to stanchions on 
the storage deck, just above the en- 
gine deck. Stein and Parian, the 
engineers, were standing by. 

“We’re getting under way,” Ty- 
russ told them. 

Stein and Parian descended to 
the engine deck, and Tyruss and 
Jonner climbed to the control deck. 
On the centerdeck, Aron and Wess- 
feld, the astrogators, were asleep. 

Tyruss climbed into the control 
chair and switched the radio to 
the Marscorp band. A voice blared 
from the communicator: 

‘‘Marscorp calling The Egg. 
Marscorp calling The Egg. Come 
in. Egg. Can you hear us, Egg? 
Rebels captured G-boat here. Dou- 
ble alert. Marscorp calling . • .” 

Tyruss switched it off, laughing. 

“A little late,” he commented. 

“Yes,” said Jonner. “Keep the 
receiver on that band, Tyruss, be- 
cause we won’t be hearing from 
our side. But, until we finish our 
mission, I’m going to disconnect 
the sending equipment.” 

Jonner floated to the other side 
of the control deck and moved 



around behind the control board. 
He was busy disconnecting wires, a 
few minutes later, when he heard 
an exclamation from Tyruss. 

He peeked around Ae edge of 
the control board. The three Mars- 
corp captives were floating up the 
companionway from below, heat- 
guns in their hands! 

“Keep your hands off those con- 
trols, Reb,” warned one of them. 
“This ship’s staying right here.” 

“Wasn’t there another one in 
this gang, Robbo?” asked another. 

Tyruss twisted in his chair and 
reached for his heat-gun. One of 
the Marscorp men rayed him 
through the throat. 

Cautiously, Jonner poked the 
muzzle of his heat-gun around the 
edge of the control board. Method- 
ically, he shot the three Marscorp 
men, one by one. They died with- 
out discovering the source of the 
invisible heat-beam that cut them 
down. 

Tyruss was dead. Cursing, Jon- 
ner went below, heat-gun in hand. 
On the centerdeck, Wessfeld’s body 
floated. Wessfeld was dead, burned 
through the chest. Aron was not 
there. 

He found all three of the others, 
locked in the airlock, without 
spacesuits. Jonner watched Aron 
suspiciously as they emerged. 

“What happened?” he de- 
manded of Aron. 

“I don’t know,” disclaimed Aron. 
“They woke us up. They had heat- 
guns then. Wessfeld tried to reach 
his, and they shot him, Stein and 
Parian were already in the airlock 
when they brought me down.” 

“Stein, were you and Parian con- 

67 



A CASE OF SUNBURN 




stantly in sight of each other, as 
ordered?” asked Jonner, watching 
Aron. Did Aron’s eyes widen appre- 
hensively? 

Stein started. 

‘‘Why, no,” he admitted. “Farlan 
was on the engine deck, and I was 
down in the airlock checking the 
spacesuits before blast-off. That’s 
routine, you know. They herded 
Farlan down and caught me by sur- 
prise.” 

“That’s right,” said Farlan. “I 
was checking the engines when they 
came through the hatch from 
above with heat-guns.” 

“Damn!” exploded Jonner. “I 
gave everyone strict orders — all 
right, it’s too late now. It just cost 
us two men, and one of the four of 
us left is a Marscorp spy. Everyone 
get above and strap down for ac- 
celeration.” 

The spy was Aron or Farlan, but 
he still didn’t know which. Aron 
could have feigned sleep, and 
slipped down to the storage deck 
to release and arm the Marscorp 
men. Or Farlan could have climbed 
from the engine deck and done it 
while Stein was in the airlock. 
Whoever it was, he had chosen to 
be locked in with the others — prob- 
ably in case the sortie failed. 

Now they were two men short, 
and still he would have to pair off 
with Aron and pair Stein with Far- 
lan. They would have to go on 
twelve-hour duty shifts, with only 
four hours free time. 

And to what purpose? As Tyruss 
had suggested several times, why 
couldn’t they have just blasted The 
Egg out of space, if the purpose 
was to get rid of it? Why go to all 

68 



the trouble of shifting it to an 
Earthward orbit? The Earth would 
be nowhere near the intersection 
point when The Egg reached 
Earth’s orbit, if that made any dif- 
ference. 

Jonner had at last let the others 
know, as he should have before, 
that one of them was a spy. But he 
would not tell them, as he had told 
Tyruss, that he had disconnected 
the radio transmitter. Let the spy 
try to get in touch with Marscorp 
now! 

“Jonner,” said Aron, “there are 
a couple of blips on the radar 
screen that shouldn’t be there.” 

Jonner swung the control chair 
to look at the screen. There were 
two dots there, almost directly to 
the rear of the spaceship. Jonner 
watched them. They held their po- 
sition on the screen. 

“I don’t know,” he said. “Pretty 
large for meteors, and there doesn’t 
seem to be any lateral movement.” 

Their ship had just begun ac- 
celeration, following a hyperbola 
that would break them free of 
Mars’ gravity. It was a hyperbola 
that swung the ship against the di- 
rection of the planet’s orbital travel, 
and, while speeding the ship away 
from the planet, slowed it in rela- 
tion to the sun. 

Jonner and Aron were on duty 
on the control deck. Stein and Far- 
lan slept on the centerdeck below. 
Two 24-hour periods had passed 
since they captured The Egg and 
maneuvered it into the right orbit 
for their departure from the Mar- 
tian area. 

The blips grew on the screen, 
CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




and still they did not move lateral- 
ly. 

“Spaceships,” Jonner decided. 
“They’re following our course, and 
overtaking us.” 

“Marscorp ships!” exclaimed 
Aron. “But Jonner, we never were 
in radar range of any Marscorp 
ship or installation. How could they 
know our position and course?” 
Without replying, Jonner arose 
from the control chair and went 
around behind the control board. 
The wires to the radio transmitter, 
which he had disconnected so care- 
fully, had been reconnected. 

“Aron,” said Jonner, coming 
back to the control chair, “go down 
and chain Parian to his bunk. He’s 
our Marscorp spy.” 

“He is?” Aron’s eyes widened. 
“How do you know?” 

“Because you haven’t been out 
of my sight since we took The Egg 
in tow, and you haven’t been near 
that control board while we were 
on duty. Stein must have let Parian 
get away from him again.” 

“Why not Stein?” 

“You forget. Stein and Wessfeld 
arrived together from Charax, at 
the rendezvous. They had to be 
clean.” 

Aron unstrapped and arose. 
“Shouldn’t we boost acceleration 
and try to evade them?” he asked, 
gesturing at the radar screen. 

“We can’t now,” said Jonner. 
“We’re on an escape hyperbola and 
we’ve got to hold this acceleration 
until she runs out, or we’d throw it 
completely off.” 

Aron went below. Jonner 
watched the screen anxiously. The 
Marscorp ships must have set an 

A CASE OF SUNBURN 



interception course, for their ac- 
celeration was much too high to be 
following their own escape orbit. 
They were getting closer rapidly. 

Jonner looked at the chronom- 
eter and at the tape still ticking 
through the ship’s control mecha- 
nism. Eleven minutes was a brief 
time, but it seemed long when ene- 
my ships were overtaking them at 
twice their acceleration. 

Towing The Egg, this old ship 
could not match the Marscorp at- 
tackers’ acceleration. It could ac- 
celerate much faster than it was, 
but if he was to hit the Earthward 
orbit he had been ordered to take 
he would have to hold his present 
acceleration until the eleven min- 
utes was up. 

And the Marscorp ships got 
closer by the minute. 

Aron climbed back to the control 
deck from below. 

“Parian’s tied up, and he’s mad- 
der than hell,” Aron reported. 
“Stein said Parian did go behind 
the control board on their last duty 
stretch, to ‘adjust’ the radio. What’s 
the situation now?” 

“They’ve started decelerating to 
match our pace when they get 
abreast of us,” said Jonner, indi- 
cating the rocket flares that now 
appeared on the aft visual screen. 

The tape suddenly ran out, and 
the rockets’ roar faded. They were 
in free fall again. 

“Get into a spacesuit and cut 
that towline,” commanded Jonner. 
“We’re going to make a run for it.” 

“We’re not going to stay and 
guard The Egg?” asked Aron, get- 
ting a suit off one of the hooks. 



69 




“No outside guns. This hulk was 
a supply ship. As soon as you get 
back in and secure the outer air- 
lock, holler and we’ll start partial 
acceleration. When you’ve strapped 
down somewhere below, holler 
again and we’ll blow the tubes.” 

While Aron went below to carry 
out his assignment, Jonner swung 
the ship end-to with the gyroscopes. 
He prayed silently that the towline 
to The Egg wouldn’t foul. They’d 
have to head back toward Mars, 
for further acceleration in this di- 
rection would throw them, helpless, 
in a path toward outer space. 

The radio loudspeaker boomed: 

“OGM ship Phobos-29 to Rebel 
spaceship. Stand by for boarding or 
get blasted.” 

The Marscorp ships were within 
a few miles now, slowing to match 
the pace of the Rebel ship. 

The outer airlock warning light 
flashed red, then green again. 

“Ready!” said Aron’s voice on 
the ship’s communicator. 

Jonner flicked his radio trans- 
mitter to the Marscorp beam. 

“Go to hell!” he announced, and 
depressed the firing buttons. 

It was uncomfortable for Aron, 
climbing out of the airlock, but 
Jonner threw the ship into a full 
G acceleration. The Marscorp 
ships loomed suddenly to each side, 
then faded behind them. A few 
futile flashes of gunfire blossomed 
from their noses. Then rings of fire 
appeared behind them as they gave 
chase. 

“Strapped down!” called Aron, 
and Jonner gave the rockets full 
blast. 

The ship leaped like a frantic 
70 



old war-horse. Jonner was pressed 
down heavily in his control chair. 
Its beams and plates groaned as 
G was piled on G. 

The Egg was gone from the rear- 
ward screens, released and floating 
free in an Earthward orbit. The 
Marscorp ships fell farther behind. 
Then they stopped receding and 
began to grow on the screens again. 
Newer and more powerful, they 
were overtaking the Rebel ship. 
Suddenly the ship’s rockets 
ceased firing again, and they were 
in free fall. A moment later, Aron 
popped up from below. 

“Are we hit?” he asked. 

“No, they aren’t back in range 
yet,” answered Jonner. “We’re out 
of fuel. Maybe it’s just as well they 
came along, because I don’t believe 
this clunk had enough fuel to over- 
take Mars again, even if we hadn’t 
blown it in that escape try.” 

The Marscorp attackers appar- 
ently interpreted the Rebel ship’s 
dead rocket tubes as a surrender. 
Within half an hour they had 
drawn alongside, and armed men 
in spacesuits came through the air- 
lock. Parian was freed of his chains, 
and Jonner, Stein and Aron were 
herded onto the centerdeck of one 
of the Marscorp ships and secured 
to stanchions. 

The Marscorp captain floated 
before them, looking them over 
quizzically, 

“I don’t know what you fellows 
were trying to prove, but you’re 
lucky,” he said. “If you hadn’t cut 
your rockets when you did, we’d 
have blasted you out of space.” 
Jonner answered out of the 
knowledge that no ships which had 

CHARLES L, FONTENAY 




accelerated as these two had in 
the past hour would have more 
than enough fuel left to get them 
back to Phobos. The Egg, trailing 
far behind Mars now, would over- 
take the planet gradually as the 
pull of the sun sped it up, but it 
would pass Mars well to sunward 
in its plunge toward the orbit of 
Earth. Any ship that tried to inter- 
cept it from Mars now would fight 
increasing solar gravity and would 
run the risk of not getting back to 
Mars. 

“Well, we accomplished our mis- 
sion, anyhow,” Jonner said resign- 
edly, “for whatever it’s worth.” 

“A fool’s mission,” said the Mars- 
corp captain, and Jonner was in- 
clined to agree with him. “The Egg 
was an experimental laboratory and 
an auxiliary power station, and we 
can build another cheaper than we 
could recover it. As for you fel- 
lows, you’re better off than you 
realize ” 

“How’s that?” asked Stein. 

“Why, if you aren’t tried as war 
criminals, you ought to be freed 
pretty quickly. According to the 
latest news reports from Mars City, 
our armies are driving your people 
back into your underground base 
in the Isidis Desert. The war will 
be over as soon as we’ve cracked 
that.” 



J ONNER, STEIN and Aron lay 
around in the Marscorp brig on 
Phobos for more than a month. To 
be precise, they floated around, for 
Phobos had little more surface 
gravity than a spaceship in orbit. 
When there was no indication they 

A CASE OF SUNBURN 



were going to be transferred from 
Phobos, Jonner set up a howl that 
at last was heard in the little moon’s 
officialdom. 

Jonner was taken before the 
adjutant of the Phobos base to air 
his complaint. 

“Look,” said Jonner, placing 
both hands belligerently on the 
official’s desk, “the terms of the 
terrestrial Space Compact apply to 
Mars, too. No prisoners of war shall 
be confined beyond a planetary 
atmosphere, except for so long as 
it is impracticable for them to be 
transferred to a surface prison.” 
“That provision was written in- 
to the compact to permit inspection 
by neutral powers and because, 
ordinarily, a prisoner has some 
hope that a surface prison will be 
overrun by troops of his own side 
and he will be released,” answered 
the adjutant mildly, peering at 
Jonner over old-fashioned rimless 
spectacles. “In your case, that’s not 
likely to happen and I can’t see 
why you’re raising such a fuss. The 
last we heard up here, our troops 
were about to overrun your last 
base.” 

“What do you mean, the last 
you heard?” demanded Jonner. “I 
heard that two days before we were 
brought to Phobos.” 

“Radio communication with 
Mars has been out completely,” ex- 
plained the adjutant good-natured- 
ly. “Static’s always bad during 
die Earth-sun conjunctions, as you 
ought to know, being a spaceman. 
This time we haven’t been able to 
get anything through at all.” 
“Well, maybe it’s true that we’ve 
lost and the war’s about over,” said 

71 




Jonner. “But the three of us still 
want to be transferred to the sur- 
face. Free fall can drive you nuts 
when you’re in an eight-by-eight 
cell.” 

“As a matter of fact,” said the 
adjutant, “there hasn’t been any 
G-boat traffic to and from the sur- 
face since the radio went out. It’s 
a dangerous business, trying to land 
at a spaceport without any radio 
guide. But we have to send a G- 
boat down for supplies in a couple 
of days, and if you fellows are in- 
sistent about it, we’ll send you down 
to Marsport on it.” 

It was not two days, but more 
than a week later than the three of 
them were allowed to get into 
spacesuits and were escorted out to 
a G-boat anchored to the surface of 
Phobos. 

Above them, the orange disc of 
Mars filled the sky, Phobos was 
swinging across the inhabited hem- 
isphere now, and the dark green 
areas of Syrtis and Hadriacum were 
plainly visible. 

Jonner strained his eyes upward 
at the red spot that was the Isidis 
Desert. Somewhere in the heart 
of that red spot. Sir Stanrich 
O’Kellin was directing the last- 
gasp stand of the Charax Rebels. 
They would be manning the under- 
ground chambers of the base, per- 
haps fighting in the corridors as 
the Marscorp troops battled to 
effect an entry. 

It might even be that the base 
had fallen by now, overrun by the 
government forces, and he and his 
companions would be, technically, 
free men by the time they landed 
at Marsport. Jonner sighed unhap- 

72 



pily. He didn’t want that kind of 
freedom. 

Following Stein and Aron, he 
climbed into the G-boat. It had a 
crew of two, plus an armed guard 
for the prisoners. 

“There’ll be no unstrapping dur- 
ing free fall,” announced the G- 
boat pilot. “Everybody will remain 
strapped down until we land. With 
the Earth-sun conjunction over, 
we’ve re-established radio com- 
munication partially, but it’s spotty, 
and we may crash.” 

“Is the war over?” asked Jonner. 

“How the hell should I know?” 
grunted the pilot. “We haven’t 
had a single news broadcast that 
makes sense since the radio came 
back in. They’re all chopped up 
with static.” 

The G-boat lifted gently from 
the surface of Phobos and began its 
spiral downward toward Mars. 
The six men, crowded together in 
its single passenger compartment, 
listened to the radio that spat and 
growled over their heads. 

What they heard was unintel- 
Hgible. 

“Sector Four . squawk . 
spsst!” snarled the loudspeaker. 
“Colonel . squawk . troops in 
. squawk . move tank squad 
to . spsst-crack-crack! . more 
ambulances . squawk . ninety 
per cent disabled . .” 

Periodically the pilot tried to 
establish contact: 

“G-boat MG-20 to Marsport. G- 
boat MG-20 to Marsport. Come in, 
Marsport.” 

The attempts were futile until 
the G-boat had entered the atmos- 
phere and was gliding high above 

CHARLES L. FONTENAY 




the desert on its broad wings. Then, 
miraculously, the airwaves were 
clear for a moment. 

“Marsport to G-boat MC-20,” 
said the loudspeaker. “Go ahead.” 

“G-boat MC-20 to Marsport,” 
said the pilot hurriedly. “Give us a 
beam. We’re coming in for a land- 
ing.” 

“Don’t land! We’re . .1” ex- 
claimed the loudspeaker, and ex- 
ploded into static in midsentence. 

“What the hell do they mean, 
don’t land?” snorted the pilot, fid- 
dling frantically and uselessly with 
dials. “They think I’ve got enough 
fuel to get back to Phobos?” 

The G-boat held its glide and 
swooped down on Marsport, a tiny 
landing field and a miniature group 
of buildings set apart from the 
dome of Mars City. Groups of men 
were scurrying about at the port 
like ants. A column of smoke rose 
ominously from one of the build- 
ings. 

The G-boat touched ground and 
skidded to a stop in mid-field. Its 
passengers unstrapped and the pilot 
opened the port. 

Men crowded into the G-boat, 
men with drawn heat-guns, men in 
the blue-and-gold marsuits of the 
Charax Rebels! 



J ONNER, A FREE man again, 
rode into Mars City in a ground- 
car with Sir Stanrich O’Kellin. 
Stein and Aron had remained at 
Marsport for the time being. Mars- 
port was completely in the hands 
of the Rebels, and efforts were be- 
ing made to get through by radio to 
Phobos to give the Marscorp forces 

A CASE OF SUNBURN 



there a surrender ultimatum. 

“What’s happened to the Mars 
City dome?” asked Jonner in as- 
tonishment as they approached the 
city. The once-transparent dome 
was cracked and badly discolored. 

“Plan Blue,” answered Sir Stan- 
rich with a smile. 

“Look, sir, how about telling me 
what happened?” said Jonner. 
“When we got captured in the mid- 
dle of our wild goose chase with 
Marscorp’s Egg, our troops had 
been driven into the ground at the 
Isidis base and we got the impres- 
sion it was only a matter of time 
before that fell. Then the radio 
goes out for a few days and we 
land here to find Mars City overrun 
with our troops.” 

“Why,” said Sir Stanrich, his 
mustache quirking mischievously, 
“we counter-attacked. We came out 
of the base, defeated the Marscorp 
army there, drove across the desert 
to Mars City and took it. Task 
forces are out now, taking over 
the other cities. That’s all there is 
to it.” 

“Simple!” snorted Jonner. “Ex- 
cept that they outnumbered us four 
or five to one, and probably out- 
gunned us more than that.” 
“Science wins wars nowj my 
boy, not numbers and guns.” 

They had entered the Mars City 
airlock and were driving down the 
broad Avenue of the Canals. Rebel 
soldiers swarmed through the city. 
The few men and women they saw 
in Marscorp uniforms staggered 
around, groping blindly, their faces 
and arms fiery red and peeling 
from sunburn.

FRED SHEINBAUM 



T he THURSDAY morning executive meeting of the Gen- 
eral Products Corporation was adjourned, as usual, with 
the Consumer’s Pledge. The same pledge recited each morning 
by children in schools across the nation. 

J. L. Spender, Assistant Vice-President of Cotter Pin Pro- 
duction for Plant Five was proud to put in these extra Thurs- 
day mornings. Let the common herd work their three day, 
twenty-one hour week. He was part of the management team, 
working behind the scenes, constantly raising the standard of 
living of the American Consumer. 

A silent elevator whisked J.L. to the roof of the Administra- 
tion Building where the heliport attendant rolled out his new 
helicopter, a June, 1998 Buick Skymaster. It was a sculpture 
in chrome and plexiglass; a suitable vehicle for the assistant 
vice-president as prescribed by Consumer's Guide. A loyal con- 

74

sumer, he bought the new model every six months. 

Once in the air and on course, J.L. set the Ultramatic auto- 
pilot — a new feature on the ’98 model — and pushed the 
chrome seat control lever to semi-reclining. Scarcely a cloud 
marred the pristine blue, and below nestled the neat, colorful 
homes of happy American consumers, but his problem was 
not to be soothed by sinking back to enjoy the crisp spring air. 

Life, J.L. felt, would be all sweetness and light were it not 
for the unaccountable affection his pretty young daughter. 
Glory, bore for an ascetic looking young man of doubtful in- 
tegrity as a consumer. 

There had been a parade of acceptable young men through 
his front door, none of whom had excited more in him than 
apathy. 

But this dne. He wore spectacles with heavy black frames 




when almost everyone used disposa- 
ble contact lenses. His suits were at 
least a month behind the current 
style. And with all those young men 
to choose from. Glory picked him 
to ask to dinner that evening. 

Glory had been taught to respect 
the might of the dollar and the dis- 
aster that comes of not spending it. 
She was a credit to her family; a 
sound, patriotic consumer. She 
could spend money faster, more 
sensibly than any of her frivolous 
friends. One fortunate young man 
would find her an excellent wife. 
No dollar-hoarder would fill her 
mind with subversive notions if he 
could prevent it. 

Much as J.L. disliked having 
that particular young man to din- 
ner, it did afford the opportunity 
to spend some of the extra money 
that always collected if you didn’t 
watch very carefully. Being forced 
to pay a savings tax wouldn’t do 
his career or social position any 
good, and he certainly wouldn’t 
think of putting it into a secret 
bank account. 

The Hudson river was beneath 
him. He would soon be home. The 
thought reminded him that though 
the family had already passed the 
five year mark in this house, he had 
still not made an appointment with 
his architect. 

Just before landing J.L. took the 
controls. The autopilot was sup- 
posed to land itself, but somehow 
he felt better doing it himself. A 
control on the dash opened the ga- 
rage, another retracted the over- 
head rotors. He drove in, closed 
the garage door, and got out. 

He paused in the hall only long 



enough to throw his hat and top- 
coat into the waste receptacle. 
From the kitchen he heard the fa- 
miliar crackling of packages being 
unwrapped. 

“Home at last,” he sighed, peck- 
ing Marge, his wife, on the cheek. 
“What did you buy today. Honey?” 
It was a treat to watch the pleas- 
ure with which Marge unwrapped 
packages. J.L. bought most things 
out of a sense of duty, but Marge 
and Glory really enjoyed spending 
money, God bless them. 

“Oh, lots of things.” Marge an- 
swered. She held a cut crystal gob- 
let to the light watching it sparkle. 
“A new set of china, thus exquisite 
stemware, and the loveliest linen 
tablecloth, and . oh, and they’re 
sending a genuine oak table for the 
dining room. The shop I bought it 
in has the cleverest service. The 
man who delivers the table cuts up 
the old one so it can be used in the 
fireplace. Isn’t that practical?” 
“That is clever.” J.L. said. “It’s 
a pity to waste it aU on that good- 
for-nothing, whatever his name is.” 
“Stringer.” 

“What?” 

“That’s his name, Ernest 
Stringer. Why is he a good-for- 
nothing? He does dress oddly, I ad- 
mit, but Glory seems to like him.” 
“That’s exactly why I’m worried. 
If she asked him for dinner there’s 
no telling what’s going on. A per- 
son like that is a bad influence.” 
J.L. said, punctuating by jabbing 
the air with his index finger. 

“Now really. Dear. You hardly 
know him.” 

“I know him well enough. You 
are the one who claims to be such 



76 



FRED SHEINBAUM 




a good judge of character. Look at 
those glasses he wears. Why doesn’t 
he wear disposable contact lenses 
like everyone else. It’s positively 
unsanitary. And did you see that 
suit? ni say he dresses oddly. That 
thing hasn’t been in style for a 
month. I bet he doesn’t spend half 
his salary.” 

“Oh, I don’t know.” Marge said, 
abstractedly. She was admiring the 
floral pattern on her new china. 
“But do be nice to him. Don’t say 
anything to embarrass Glory.” 
“Oh, I’ll be nice all right. I guess 
I know how to act. You and your 
daughter have trained me. And 
there are worse things than being 
embarrassed.” He would have gone 
on, but at that moment Glory saun- 
tered into the room. 

“Hi, Dad. Back from the grind, I 
see.” Her hair was the color of 
lemon and in her blue eyes was re- 
flected a youthful zest for life. 

“Do you like the new dress? It 
comes in seventeen colors. I bought 
them all. And hats and shoes and 
gloves and bags to match.” She 
said, walking as she had seen pro- 
fessional models walk, with arms 
akimbo and swinging hips. 

“Very pretty,” he said, “but 
shouldn’t there be a little more to 
it? Style is style, but leave some- 
thing to the imagination. They 
can’t be using up much fabric with 
a number like that.” 

“See, Mom. Didn’t I tell you ex- 
actly what he’d say? Daddy is so 
mid-century. Aren’t you. Darling?” 
“Glory, at the risk of seeming 
. ah . mid-century, I think 
you owe your mother and myself 
some information about this person 

FILTHY RICH 



you’ve asked to dinner.” 

“What kind of information? 
You’ve met him,” she said. Her 
eyes narrowed slightly. 

“Yes, I’ve met him. What is his 
background? What does he work 
at? What kind of a consumer is 
he?” 

“Dad, you are not being fair.” 
“Not fair? Why not? Are you 
ashamed of him?” 

“No, I’m not ashamed of him. 
Ernie is a dear sweet boy. He lost 
both of his parents when he was 
very young. Bringing himself up 
has made him different from most 
people, I guess. But he has done 
very well. And all by himself, too. 
He’s an OE, you know.” 

This only added heat to J.L.’s 
burning suspicion. “I don’t want to 
sound narrow minded. Glory, but 
I’ve met a good many Opinion En- 
gineers in business and darned few 
of them are fit company for a 
young girl. They picture themselves 
as independent thinkers. They 
don’t spend their money as they 
should.” 

Glory’s lips whitened as she 
pressed them together. J.L. saw the 
gathering storm in her eyes. “That’s 
not fair,” she said. “Ernie is per- 
fectly all right. He just needs look- 
ing after. Mother, help me.” 

Marge smiled calmly, and said, 
“Your father is just acting like a 
father, that’s all. He is trying to 
protect you.” 

“Well, I’m twenty years old, al- 
most. And it’s practically the twen- 
ty-first century, but it looks like the 
middle ages around here. I’m sorry 
I asked him to come. I’ll never ask 
anyone again.” She threw her head 



77 




back and pressed the back of her 
hand to her forehead. 

“Now don’t start getting dra- 
matic. I only want what’s best for 
you.” J.L. said. But it was only 
bluff. He knew when he was licked. 

“All right, all right,” he said, 
ing to prevent her tears from brim- 
ming over. “I promise to be good 
tonight.” It was time for him to re- 
treat, as gracefully as possible, to 
his study and the latest issue of 
Consumer's Guide. 

Which he did. 



A t a quarter of seven J.L. 

tottered into his living room. 
He was fully dressed except for a 
bright red sash hanging slack, like 
a sail in the doldrums, just brush- 
ing the tops of his patent leather 
shoes. 

Dressing was a nerve-jarring, 
thirst-making business. He was in 
full sympathy with the need for 
changing men’s styles so frequently, 
but Aose overpaid designers could 
surely dream up easier outfits to 
get into. 

He separated a decanter of bour- 
bon from its fellows on the mirror- 
backed shelves and from it poured 
a lavish helping. Using the tip of 
his index finger, he twirled the ice 
cubes and, with a sigh, lifted the 
golden fluid to his lips. 

Over the rim of the glass he saw 
Glory come floating into view. She 
was dressed, mostly below the waist, 
in yards of a light gauzy fabric that 
seemed to have life of its own. 

She stopped at the door while 
her eyes slowly swept the room. J.L. 
was reminded of a spider making 

78 



sure the web would be cosy. Her 
glance came to rest on the portly 
figure of her father. 

She exhaled a sigh of controlled 
exasperation. “Daddy, your sash is 
hanging. It looks like a flag at half 
mast” 

“I am perfectly aware that my 
sash is hanging.” He wasn’t sure he 
approved of the tone of her voice. 

“Well tuck it up then. Ernie will 
be here any minute.” 

“It refuses to stay up. How do 
you know? Maybe it is supposed to 
hang. Those designers should be 
forced to dress themselves in these 
things before they loose them on an 
unsuspecting public.” 

She glided towards him and, with 
a few deft touches, the sash was 
neatly in place. “Dad, promise 
you’ll be nice to him.” 

J.L. smiled. Much as he pro- 
tested, he liked being fussed over. 
“Of course. I’ll be nice. When am I 
not nice? I just said those things 
about him because . well, I 
wanted you to be wary.” 

“Don’t worry about Ernie. He’s a 
dear. And, please, no economics 
lectures. That business about thrift 
being a menace to prosperity may 
have been a new idea when you 
were young, but now every kid in 
school is taught it. So spare us. It 
makes you sound like an old fuddy 
duddy.” 

Fuddy duddy? J.L. was about to 
make a stunning rejoinder when he 
heard the whirring of helicopter 
rotors overhead. 

“There he is.” Glory said, excit- 
edly, “Let him in.” 

“Where are you running?” he 
asked, surprised. She was as fully 

FRED SHEINBAUM 




dressed as she was likely to be. 

‘‘You know I can’t be here 
when he comes in,” she said. 

“Can’t be here? Where else 
should you be?” J.L. asked. The 
situation was getting out of hand. 

“Strategy, my dear parent. I 
can’t just be sitting here waiting 
when he walks in. He is supposed 
to be waiting for me . with bated 
breath. It makes my entrance more 
effective. Ta ta for now.” She was 
gone. 

The prospect of dining at the 
same table with the young man 
was repellent enough. Now he 
would have to provide entertain- 
ing conversation until Glory chose 
to appear. 

The door chimes sounded. 

J.L. drained his glass, stiffened 
his spine, and strode to the door 
pulling it open with a jerk, like a 
doctor removing adhesive tape. 

Any hope J.L. might have had 
was dashed when the door opened 
to reveal Ernest Stringer, his pierc- 
ing brown eyes, a tight lipped 
smile, and the traditional gift of 
candy under his arm. 

“Good evening, Mr. Spender,” 
he said. “You are, I believe, expect- 
ing me.” He was so thin that the 
current, tight fitting style made him 
look very like a figure constructed 
with pipe cleaners. 

J.L. did his best to appear gra- 
cious. “Gome in, come in,” he said, 
taking his hat and coat. “Glory will 
be in soon.” 

The suit was up to date, but J.L. 
spotted other telling details. His 
heels were slightly lighter in color 
than the rest of the shoes, indicat- 
ing they had been reheeled. It was 

FILTHY RICH 



also evident, to a trained eye, that 
the collar and cuffs of his shirt had 
been resized, proof that the shirt 
had been laundered; perhaps, even 
more than once. 

“What can I get you to drink?” 
J.L. asked, leading the way into the 
living room. 

“Nothing, thank you. I seldom 
take alcohol,” the young man said. 

“Is that right? A young fellow 
like you. It certainly is fortunate 
that the rest of your generation 
doesn’t share your prejudice. Alco- 
holic beverages account for more 
than five percent of total consumer 
purchases.” 

“Five percent. As much as that? 
Well, in that case I should have 
something. Ah ... a glass of sherry, 
I think,” he said, smiling with lips 
unparted. 

“Sherry? Sure you don’t want 
something more . , . more sub- 
stantial?” 

“Sherry will do nicely, thank 
you.” 

A sherry drinker is capable of 
anything, J.L. thought. He poured 
the wine into a high stemmed glass 
and mixed another bourbon for 
himself; this time going a little 
easier on the ice. 

The young man held the stem 
between spidery fingers, turning it 
slowly, delicately sniffing the bou- 
quet. 

J.L. wished Glory or Marge 
would rescue him. He couldn’t 
think of a thing to say. What could 
one say to a male sherry drinker? 

“What do you think of the inter- 
national situation?” J.L. asked, just 
to break the uncomfortable silence. 

“What international situation?” 



79 




“I mean do you think we are 
headed for war?” J.L, was sorry he 
had asked the harmless question. 

The young man laughed derisive- 
ly. “What an idea. Of course there 
won’t be a war,” he said. 

“Why do you say that?” He 
wanted to see how far Stringer 
would go. 

“It’s quite evident isn’t it? War 
has been threatening for more than 
fifty years. It will probably continue 
to threaten for fifty more. It gives 
our government and that of our 
enemies the excuse to build enough 
munitions to take up the slack in 
the economy between production 
and the ability to consume what we 
produce.” 

“That’s ridiculous. I’ve never 
heard such nonsense.” The young 
idiot, he thought, anyone with sense 
knew that to be true, but no one 
made a fuss about it for fear of up- 
setting a system that worked so 
well. 

It was an accepted ii^ct of life, 
certainly preferable to actual war, 
and never mentioned in polite so- 
ciety. 

Stringer continued, speaking 
slowly, as if explaining to a very 
small child. He clasped his long 
fingers over his left knee hugging it 
almost to his chest, and rocked 
himself slightly. “Don’t you see? If 
there was a real war millions of 
consumers would be taken out of 
the market for the duration, and 
many permanently. But this way 
governments can spend as much as 
they need to on war goods, to bal- 
ance the economy, without disturb- 
ing the consumers at all. 

“The politicians love it, too. It 

80 



supplies them with political issues, 
not easily come by these days.” 
Stringer concluded. He seemed 
pleased with himself. 

J.L.’s glass was again empty. He 
rose to fill it saying, “That is a 
very interesting theory. Have you 
told it to many people?” 

Stringer did not answer. 

J.L. turned to see what had 
caused this sudden reticence. The 
young man sat with wide-eyed stare 
and loosely hanging jaw; obviously 
incapable of speech. 

Glory had made her strategic en- 
trance. 

“Ah, there you are. Dear,” J.L. 
said. “Mr. Stringer, here, has just 
been explaining international poli- 
tics to me.” 

“Doesn’t he have a fine mind. 
Daddy?” she said, catching the 
young man’s hand and favoring 
him with a smile that set his adam’s 
apple to dancing. 

Fine? J.L. thought, narrow 
would be more accurate. He was 
about to make an audible comment 
along those lines when Marge 
called them in to dinner. 

All through the meal Marge 
fawned upon the young man, in- 
dulging the predatory instinct of a 
mother with a marriageable daugh- 
ter. 

With the clam bisque she told of 
Glory’s childhood ; the prettiest 
child in the neighborhood. With 
the pressed duckling she told of an 
army of suitors, each more desirable 
than the last, that Glory had dis- 
carded like week-old overcoats. 
And with the fresh tropical fruit 
supreme she praised the condition 
of matrimony with such fervor that 

FRED SHEINBAUM 




J.L. could feel the warmth of a 
blush on his cheek. 

When the young people left for 
the evening Marge sighed and said, 
“Don’t they make a nice couple?” 

“Have you lost your mind?” J.L. 
replied, with almost saintly re- 
straint. ^ 

“Is something the matter. 
Dear?” 

J.L. threw up his hands in des- 
pair. “Is something the matter, she 
asks. Why did you butter him up 
like that? Did you see his face? He 
looked like a dog being scratched 
behind the ear. If he proposes to 
Glory tonight it’s your fault.” 

“Well, I think he’d make a fine 
son-in-law.” 

“That non-consumer? I’d sooner 
drop him from the helicopter,” he 
said. He noticed she was smiling. 
“Don’t laugh. Marge. This is seri- 
ous. I’m going to have a good long 
talk with Glory when she gets 
home. I’ll put a stop to this.” 

“Be careful what you say. Dear,” 
she said. 

“Don’t worry. I guess I know 
how to talk to my own daughter. 
I’m as modem as the next parent, 
you know that. But there comes a 
time when every child needs guid- 
ance, and I . .” 

“Don’t stay up too late. Dear,” 
Marge interrupted, squelching a 
yawn. She kissed his cheek and left 
the room. 

J.L. poured another drink and 
settled in a comfortable chair to 
wait and to plan. 

Perhaps he should be imperious. 
On the screen of his imagination he 
saw himself. He was taller. His 
arms were folded high on his chest; 

FILTHY RICH 



his legs were spread wide like two 
sturdy trees. He had grown a full 
handle bar mustache. “Glory,” he 
could hear himself say, “I forbid 
you ever to see that man again.” 

Unfortunately the screen showed 
the probable result She salaamed 
before him, touching her forehead 
to the carpet, “I hear and obey O 
Magnificent One.” Sarcasm was 
more than he could bear. If only he 
had some proof. If only Marge 
hadn’t been so approving. 

The slam of the front door 
dragged him from a nightmare in 
which Glory, having married Ernest 
Stringer, was drowning in a room- 
ful of coin and currency. The level 
of money had just reached her 
frightened eyes. 

In the dim light of the hall he 
saw her leaning against the door 
she had slammed. Her shoulders 
were hunched with sobbing. 

“Glory, what’s the matter?” 

She looked up, saw her father, 
and ran to her room. 

J.L. heaved out of the chair and 
followed, slowly. Her door was 
open a crack. He hesitated, then 
knocked lightly. No answer. He 
pushed the door wide enough to 
see in. She was perched on the 
edge of the bed, elbows on her 
knees, crying silently in the dark- 
ened room. 

“Mind if I come in?” 

Still no answer. 

He stepped in and sat gingerly 
on the bed beside her. Several min- 
utes passed. “Want to tell me?” he 
said gently. 

She shook her head violently 
without looking up.

The puzzle left by the Mar- 
tians had to be solved. Could 
the four Terrans do it? Or 
was death to be the only 
answer that lay within . 



THE 

maze 



M y name is George Balmain. 

I am forty years of age — or 
should it be a minus quantity? I am 
well known (Was? Will be?) as a 
compiler of the more esoteric type 
of puzzle published by the high- 
brow literary weeklies. My main 
claim to fame was, I like to think, 
the invention of the Three Dimen- 
sional Cryptic Crossword. A steady 
trickle of royalties from this source 
maintained me in a state of com- 
fort if not of luxury. My Inc was 
pleasant enough for the times in 
which I lived — the Cold War, with 
occasional flareups of “police ac- 
tivity”, had been in progress for 
over a century, and most of us were 
able to keep the fear of the Hot 
War — which would, of course, spell 
the end of civilization if not of the 
planet itself — well below the sur- 
face of our minds. 

I was, of course, interested in 
Space Travel — but it was largely a 
professional interest. After all, new 



82 





BY BERTRAM CHANDLER 



words, new expressions, new tech- 
nicalities were the tools of my trade. 
And I was interested in the Maze. 
This remarkable artifact had been 
uncovered by one of the frequent 
Martian dust storms. It was, so far 
as could be seen from the outside, 



a low building, devoid of all orna- 
mentation, circular, about two 
Earth miles in diameter. It was 
built of closely fitting blocks of 
stone. Inside was a veritable war- 
ren, a labyrinth, of passages. People 
had gone in — armed, with lights. 



with an ample supply of food and 
water and oxygen, with spools of 
strong thread to pay out behind 
them — and had never come out. 

It must be, I always thought, no 
more than a huge puzzle — and the 
penalty for failure to solve it must 
be death. Now and again I allowed 
myself to hope that I might, some 
day, be the man to solve the puzzle 
— after all, the Martians were, ac- 
cording to the archaeologists, be- 
ings similar to ourselves. It was rea- 
sonable to suppose that their minds 
worked in a similar way. 

But I knew that my hopes were 
wild. I should never be able to 
afford a one way passage even to 
the Moon — and, in any case. Mars 
was out of bounds to all but those 
on Governmental business. Even so, 
the Maze was a subject for conjec- 
ture. Using what scanty data I 
could lay my hands upon I wrote a 
series of articles on it. The third of 
this series was returned by the edi- 
tor to whom it was submitted, ac- 
companied by no more than a re- 
jection slip. At the same time I no- 
ticed that no news or speculation 
concerning the Maze was being 
published in any newspaper or pe- 
riodical, and that it was never men- 
tioned by the TV news services. All 
of this, naturally, intrigued me the 
more. 

Even so, I never expected, some 
nine months after the rejection of 
my article, to find myself on Mars. 
I’ll not go into details about the 
voyage — ^I’m a poor spaceman and 
my belly takes kindly to neither ac- 
celeration nor free fall. Suffice it to 
say that I was interviewed in my 
home by two Senior Civil Servants, 

84 



offered the opportunity of solving 
the Martian puzzle and then, be- 
fore I had a chance to consider all 
the implications of my acceptance, 
sworn into the Space Navy Reserve 
with the rank of Lieutenant. It was 
not until I arrived on Mars that I 
was told what it was all about. 

It was the Admiral himself who 
told me. Not at once — when I was 
shown into his office I found him 
working with one of my Three Di- 
mensional puzzles. He was stuck on 
43 North — ‘T leave the com and 
become mystified on Mars ...” I 
told him that he, of all persons, 
should know that one. Take “I” 
from “maize” — and what have you 
got? He cursed his stupidity, then 
asked me if I’d ever thought of 
having diagonals, and why not 
“Up” as well as “Down”, and 
“South” and “West” as well as 
“North” and “East”? We chatted 
for a while about the mechanics of 
Crossword compiling, then he said, 
“You know, Balmain, it’s my idea 
bringing you out here. I’ve always 
been a fan of yours. A mind like 
yours should be able to solve the 
puzzle — and without wasting too 
much time about it.” 

“And what is the urgency, sir?’^ 
I asked him. 

“War,” he said. “Not tomorrow 
(we hope) — ^but, perhaps, the day 
after. Our friends on the other side 
of the Curtain may soon be strong 
enough to launch a swift, decisive 
blow . .” 

“But what’s the Maze got to do 
with it?” 

“That’s for you to find out. But 
I’ll put you into the picture — as 
much of a picture as we have at 

BERTRAM CHANDLER 




present. We’ve been pushing ships 
out as far as the Asteroids for quite 
some time now — although the news 
hasn’t been made public. We’ve 
learned a lot. We’ve learned that 
the war that devastated Mars, that 
all but sterilized her, wasn’t a war 
between the Martian nations but a 
war with — Outsiders. Outsiders 
from Planet Five.” 

“Jupiter?” I asked. 

“iVo. Jupiter is Planet Five now. 
The old Planet Five was hit by 
something that blew it into the 
debris that is now the Asteroid Belt 
— some super fission-fusion-fission 
bomb, perhaps. At about the same 
time the Maze was built — and used. 
And after the Maze was completed 
intelligent life vanished from 
Mars.” 

“How?” 

“That’s for you to find out, Bal- 
main. There are two theories: one 
is that the Martians were stricken 
by conscience and committed mass 
suicide; the Maze being or contain- 
ing some sort of super weapon. 
( It’d be nice to have . .) The other 
is that the Maze offered some sort 
of escape from the vengeance of the 
warships that were in Space, and 
well clear, when Planet Five blew 
up. (That’d be nice, too . .) 

“Anyhow, I’m sending you into 
the Maze tomorrow. I’m sorry that 
I can’t give you time to get proper- 
ly acclimatized — ^but, as I’ve told 
you, time is the one thing that 
we’re liable to be short of. I’ll be 
sending three other Lieutenants in 
with you — all volunteers. Hall is 
regular Navy. Welsh is a physicist. 
And Pontefract’s one of our archae- 
ologist^’^’ 

THE MAZE 



“Pontefract Castle . .” I mut- 
tered to myself. “Broken bridge . 
A castle that puts one in mipd of 
broken bridges . .” 

The Admiral laughed. 

“She won’t put you in mind of 
any castles or broken bridges.” 

“Our Lieutenant Pontefract. 
You don’t mind working with 
women, I hope?” 

“I don’t know,” I said. “I’ve 
never tried it before.” 

I was favorably impressed by 
my three fellow explorers at first 
sight. Hall looked like what he was 
— a professional spaceman, trained 
to react instantaneously in any 
emergency. Welsh, like myself, was 
an obvious civilian in uniform, in 
about the same age group. And Sue 
. (She’s reading this over my 
shoulder as I write, but I’d have 
said what I’m saying now in any 
case.) She was in uniform, too. No 
doubt it was of the correct cut — 
but she made it look, with her slim, 
dark elegance, like something 
straight from Paris ornamented 
with gold braid and buttons. She 
looked as much like a naval officer 
as she did like an archaeologist — 
which was not at all. 

We’d barely time to get ac- 
quainted before we were hustled 
into the big turret-drive Spurling. 
The Admiral — ^bulky in his outdoor 
clothing, his face all but hidden by 
his respirator, came out to see us 
off and wish us good luck. His pale 
blue eyes behind the thick glass of 
his goggles looked worried. Oh, I 
know that the eyes are supposed to 
be incapable of showing expression, 

85 




and that ascribing expression to 
them is a literary fiction — ^but his 
eyes looked worried. 

That flight, from the Spaceport 
to the Maze, was all I ever saw of 
Mars. (There had been a hemi- 
sphere-wide sandstorm the day I ar- 
rived and we had dropped down 
through a thick, yellow dust haze.) 
I saw the canals and the oases — 
wide, weedy ditches in the desert, 
straggling clumps of scrawny, tat- 
tered shrubs and trees — and the oc- 
casional ruined city with an odd, 
broken tower or two, survivors of 
atomic blast, of sandstorm, of ero- 
sion, still standing. I saw the sky 
that was too dark a blue, the sun 
that was too small and not bright 
enough. I saw the desert and the 
low, smoothly rounded hills, and 
the marching dust devils swirling 
across the arid waste. 

And then I saw the Maze. 

There was, at first glance, noth- 
ing spectacular about it. It was only 
when we were coming in for a land- 
ing that we could appreciate its 
size. Imagine a penny dropped on 
an orange tablecloth — a slightly 
rumpled tablecloth. That’s what it 
was like. When we had landed on 
the leeward side of it I saw that 
this penny had a thick rim — a very 
thick rim, towering all of three hun- 
dred feet above our heads. The 
sight of all that dark brown stone, 
worn shiny-smooth by the wind and 
the sand, towering against the dark 
blue sky was, somehow, frightening. 
I had a moment of near panic, a 
feeling that I had bitten off rather 
more than I could chew, that this 
was one puzzle I’d never solve. 

Sue and Sam Hall were the effi- 

86 



dent ones. Whilst Bill Welsh and I 
were gawping through the ports at 
the Maze they were hustling round 
inside the cabin, getting equipment 
together, checking off various items 
and, eventually, practically forcing 
the respirators on to the heads of 
the physicist and myself. 

We said goodbye to the two 
pilots, clambered out through the 
little airlock on to the powdery 
sand. We slung equipment about 
ourselves until we looked like walk- 
ing Christmas trees — the light grav- 
ity had its advantages — picked up 
other gear that we had stowed in 
carrier bags. 

“Now, puzzle expert,” said Sue, 
her high, clear voice muffled by her 
respirator, “what do we do?” 

“Where’s the door, archaeolo- 
gist?” I asked her. 

“There are thirty doors,” she 
said, “evenly spaced. A door every 
point two one — give or take a cou- 
ple of hundredths — of a mile. Do 
you think that has any signifi- 
cance?” 

“I don’t think so,” I said. “The 
fact that this building is circular 
indicates that the actual point of 
entry is of no importance. ( I am as- 
suming, of course, that the Mar- 
tians thought as we do.) On the 
other hand, it might be as well not 
to use a door used by past expedi- 
tions. We know that they did not 
come out again.” 

“Sound reasoning,” said Sam 
Hall. “Number thirteen is the near- 
est — ^we numbered the doors with 
paint. It hasn’t been used yet — 
some people are superstitious . .” 
“I take it that it was an absolute- 
ly arbitary numbering system,” I 

BERTRAM CHANDLER 




? 



said. “Whoever did the marking 
just called the door that he started 
with ‘One’ and carried on from 
there . 

“That’s the way it was,” said Sue. 

“All right, then. We’ll make it 
thirteen.” 

Welsh and I followed Sue and 
Hall, who took the lead. The door 
— the white numerals standing out 
boldly on the wall above it — ^was 
lower than I had anticipated. I 
watched the others go down on to 
their hands and knees — ^having first 
removed most of their equipment 
— and crawl through. I stayed out- 
side to pass the gear in to them. A 
screaming roar startled me. I saw 
that it was the Spurling. It had 
lifted on its jets, was slowly follow- 
ing us. It would land outside the 
door and wait there until we 
emerged, or until relieved. I won- 
dered what would happen if we 
came out another way. 

There was no more gear to pass 
in. I backed into the Maze, making 
the end of the reel of stout line I 
carried fast to the pole we had 
placed athwart the entrance. I was 
surprised at the spaciousness of the 
chamber in which I found myself. 
Hall and Welsh were sitting on the 
floor, tinkering with the radio. 
“There’s nothing wrong with it, 
Sam,” Welsh was saying. “It’s hap- 
pened with every expedition. Once 
inside the Maze, the radio dies. We 
might as well leave it here.” 

“No,” said Hall. “We shall need 
it when we get out — after all, we 
might come out through a different 
door.” 

I joined Sue as she walked along 
THE MAZE 



the wall of the chamber. We shone 
the beams of our torches on the 
bas-reliefs. 

“Human,” she said. “According 
to the biologists it couldn’t have 
been so, shouldn’t have been so. 
But every picture, every sculpture 
we’ve found tells the same story. 
Men and women . .” 

“What about bones?” 

“There aren’t any. They must 
have cremated their dead. We’re 
hoping that we may find something 
eventually — somebody who died by 
accident miles from a city and 
whose body was never found — ^but 
we haven’t done so yet. Well — ^what 
do you make of all this?” 

“It seems fairly obvious,” I said. 
“Those men and women, and, as 
you say, they could be a crowd 
from any city street on Earth in 
fancy dress, are all depicted walk- 
ing the same way. It’s an indica- 
tion that we should do likewise.” 
“We haven’t much choice,” she 
said. “The only other way out of 
this chamber is back outside.” 

The others agreed. Before we 
passed through die door into the 
passage beyond I examined the 
carvings carefully, trying to find 
some clue. There was none, at least 
not so far as I could see. They de- 
picted a procession of men, women 
and children, all in long robes and 
with strange headgear, all march- 
ing in the direction that we were 
taking. 

The passage we entered was nar- 
row and we had to walk in single 
file. After some discussion Welsh 
took the lead — ^he had some theory 
that I never quite understood about 
radio-activity in the Maze, and 

87 




was carrying a counter of his own 
invention and manufacture. Sam 
Hall followed him, and then Sue. I 
brought up the rear, paying out the 
thin, strong cord behind me. 

The walls of the passage were 
smooth and dark, as was the floor. 
The only ornamentation — if orna- 
mentation it was — was in the ceil- 
ing — a stippling of light yellow 
dots, grouped, apparently, at ran- 
dom. The same pattern was evident 
on the ceiling of the circular cham- 
ber we entered. Besides the doorway 
we had come through there were 
three others. 

By common consent the choice 
was mine. I decided that the clue 
lay in the ceiling decoration. There 
were thirty ways into the Maze. We 
had to choose between three door- 
ways. Over the one through which 
we had come was a group with ex- 
actly thirty dots. One of the other 
doors was marked with twenty nine, 
one with twenty eight and the other 
with twenty seven. Twenty eight 
and twenty seven might be, I de- 
cided, short cuts to the center of 
the Maze. Might be. After all — I 
hadn’t yet got into the mind of the 
long dead compiler of this puzzle. 
I threw the beam of my torch into 
the entrance over which were the 
twenty nine dots. 

I said, ''This one.” 

Once again Welsh, nursing his 
precious counter, took the lead. 
This tunnel was not straight, as the 
first one had been. The physicist 
rounded a bend with more enthusi- 
asm than caution. We heard him 
cry out. We heard a thud like a 
heavy door, a heavy stone door, 
slamming back into place, 

88 



We found the trap — knowing 
that it was there. It was a flagstone, 
the entire breadth of the passage- 
way, cunningly pivoted. We forced 
it down and open without any dif- 
ficulty, revealing a polished chute 
that slid down, at a steep angle, 
into absolute blackness. Hall took 
a deep breath and then removed 
the facepiece of his respirator. He 
shouted. He shouted again. Apart 
from the booming echoes there was 
no answer. He unslung the radio 
transceiver from his shoulder, say- 
ing, “This is one piece of equip- 
ment that isn’t much use.” He held 
it over the chute, then dropped it. 

We never heard the sound it 
made when it hit bottom. 

“One of us,” I said, “had better 
go back for help.” 

I hurried back into the circular 
chamber. Of the doorway through 
which we had entered it there was 
no sign — no sign, that is, save for 
the thin, white cord that seemingly 
vanished into a solid wall. The 
door, obviously, had been actuated 
by the pivoting flagstone. 

We did all the obvious things 
and a few that weren’t so obvious. 
We might just as well have tried to 
open that door with our fingernails. 

It was then that we had the 
argument with Hall. It wasn’t a 
question of courage — he would 
never have held his rank in the 
Service of his choice had he not 
been brave beyond the average. But 
he didn’t see things the way we — 
Sue and I — did. 

“I’m afraid we’ll have to write 
Bill off,” he said. “There must be 
some indication of a pitfall that he 
missed . 



BERTRAM CHANDLER 




“There is,” I told him. “That 
tiny yellow star set into the floor.” 
“Then that’s a sign we’ll have to 
watch for in future. Meanwhile, we 
can jump across the pivoted slab 
quite easily. It’s hardly more than 
a long step . .” 

“And leave Bill?” flared Sue. 
“Yes. He made a mistake, and 
paid for it. The way I see the lay- 
out of this Maze we’re supposed to 
profit by his mistake. Furthermore, 
I need hardly remind you and 
George that you’re both commis- 
sioned officers of the U.N.S.N. You 
have a definite mission to perform 
— and it would be incorrect to 
jeopardize the success of this mis- 
sion by risking all our lives to at- 
tempt the rescue of one man, who 
is probably dead.” 

“If that’s military logic,” I told 
him, “I’m glad that I’m a civilian. 
But there’re other kinds of logic, 
Sam. And I’m beginning to get 
faint glimmerings of the purpose of 
this puzzle. Only the fittest will 
survive to solve it.” 

“Fitness for what?^^ asked Hall. 
“I don’t know, Sam. But I’m 
trying to put myself into the com- 
piler’s mind. He was humanoid — or 
human. He had lived at a time 
when, no doubt, the military vir- 
tues were very much in fashion. He 
had seen one world wrecked by the 
exercise of these virtues, another 
one ruined. Therefore — he would 
be inclined to think that some — 
some, mark you, not all — of the 
military virtues were not worth 
perpetuating.” 

“Such as?” queried Sue. 

“Such as ‘Orders is orders’. I 
think — again, I may be wrong — 

THE MAZE 



that loyalty to one’s own kind is a 
virtue of far greater importance.” 

“AU right,” said Hall. “I still 
think that you’re wrong — ^but I’m 
going down.” 

“I’m not wrong,” I said. “If this 
had been a death trap there’d have 
been a vertical drop. All the same, 
I hope that our ropes reach to the 
bottom.” 



W E BENT them all together, 
but they didn’t reach. 

Then, when we had Hall dan- 
gling at the extreme end of our 
tether, I slipped. I make no excuses 
for what followed. I let go of rope, 
put out my hands to steady myself. 
The rope was fast around my waist. 
I had made it fast myself. I don’t 
think that I should ever be able to 
duplicate that hitch — it had seemed 
secure enough. It didn’t hold. 

After a long, horrid pause we 
heard Hall shouting. We could hear 
and recognize his voice but could 
not distinguish his words. There 
was only one thing for us to do. We 
rearranged the equipment with 
which we were hung, slung the car- 
rier bags to our sides. Carefully we 
lowered ourselves into the chute in 
such a way that we were face to 
face and with our backs pressing 
against the polished sides. We let 
go. 

We did not have as much control 
over our movements as we had 
hoped — even so, our descent was 
not suicidally rapid. We were able 
to slow down — although it was a 
painful process — ^when we heard 
confused shouting below us. Then, 
to our intense relief, the angle at 

89 




which we were falling became far 
less steep. When, at last, we slid 
out to a horizontal, polished floor 
we had almost lost our momentum. 

My torch had been on the whole 
time. I swung the beam; it fell on 
Hall. He was bending over the body 
of Welsh. 

“Thank God for a light,” he 
said. “Tm afraid that Bill’s dead.” 

He was right. The cause of death 
was obvious. The physicist must 
have struck the back of his head 
when he fell into the chute. I am 
sure that the designer of the Maze 
had not intended this, that it was 
just an unlucky accident. But it was 
irrevocable. 

We left him there. We didn’t like 
doing it, but we had no choice in 
the matter. We left him in that 
hemispherical chamber with its pol- 
ished floor and walls — a tomb of 
which a Pharaoh would have been 
proud. But we did not leave him — 
as the Pharaohs were left — with the 
possessions that he would need in 
the next world. We took his water 
and his compressed food tablets. 
We took the oxygen cylinder from 
his respirator, and the spare one. 
We took his knife and his pistol. 
Hall, whose own torch had been 
smashed, succeeded in repairing it 
from the unbroken parts of the 
dead man’s. 

Then we had to decide, once 
again, which way to go. To return 
up the chute was out of the ques- 
tion. As before, we had a choice of 
three doors. As before, we had the 
same random pattern of stippling 
as a guide. It was obvious to me 
that we had taken some sort of 
short cut. One doorway was marked 

90 



with a group of fourteen dots, one 
with a group of thirteen, and the 
other with a group of twelve. 

I said that fourteen was a logical 
choice. 

“We took the logical choice be- 
fore,” said Hall. “And Bill’s dead 
because of it.” 

“It was accidental, his death,” I 
said. “And if the numbers are any 
guide we have made more progress 
than we would have done had we 
taken the other doorways.” 

Sue laughed shakily. “You’re the 
crossword puzzle expert, George. 
Has it occurred to you that 29 was 
29 down?” 

“It has,” I said. “And it may be 
that this will be 14 down. I’ll take 
the lead — and I’ll keep my eyes 
skinned for a little star in the floor.” 

I saw the star in the floor. It was, 
as the other had been, just at a 
bend in the tunnel. We found the 
pivoted flag — it opened over a 
chute similar to the other one. I 
thought at first that we should 
slide down it, then decided against 
it. The first chute had been both a 
warning and a test. The little yel- 
low star was a warning. I switched 
my torch off, told the others to do 
the same. When our eyes became 
accustomed to the darkness we saw 
a dim, ruddy glow at the bottom of 
the chute. I pulled the glove off my 
hand, held it over the opening. I 
could detect the waves of heat 
striking my bare skin. 

“Whoever they were, they played 
for keeps,” said Hall. 

“It’s like one of those mazes they 
use to test the intelligence of rats,” 
said Sue shakily. 

BERTRAM CHANDLER 




We threw one of our heavy packs 
over the pivoting flagstone. The 
floor on the other side seemed solid 
enough. Then Hall jumped over; 
he made the other end of his rope 
fast around my waist with his own 
hands. Sue went next. I brought up 
the rear, but resumed the lead 
when I was safely over. 

So we carried on. We wandered 
through a monotony of tunnels 
interspersed with hemispherical 
chambers. After the usual narrow, 
warning escapes we learned to be 
alert for booby traps, to distinguish 
the warning signs in floor or walls 
or ceiling. They weren’t all visual. 

Then — ^it was shortly after we 
had rested in one of the chambers 
to nibble our tasteless tablets and 
sip from our water bottles, we 
struck a new kind of booby trap; 
or, rather, it struck us. There was 
no warning — or, if there was, it 
was one not apparent to our senses. 
There was a sudden flash — not 
bright, although I thought at first 
that it had blinded me. I realized 
then that the torch in my hand was 
gone, that I was holding some 
queer object of irregular shape (it 
was the battery — or part of the 
battery). The pack on my back 
was suddenly light. The facepiece 
of my respirator fell to pieces. 

But I could breathe comfortably. 
The air was quite dense, sufficiently 
rich in oxygen. That was all that I 
could do. I was completely baffled. 

Hall, however, was trained to 
work, if need be, in complete dark- 
ness. His hands must have been 
busy touching, feeling. When he 
spoke there was wonderment and 
admiration in his voice. 



“What a weapon!” he said. 
“What a weapon it would make!” 

“What was it?” I heard Sue ask. 

“Some sort of radiation that, 
somehow, destroys all metals. The 
casing of my torch — all that’s left 
in my hand is a sprinkling of very 
fine dust. My oxygen cylinders. 
My knife. My gun. The zipper of 
my coveralls . Well, George, 
you’re the expert. What do we do 
now?” 

I waited until my own hands had 
verified the truth of Hall’s state- 
ment. 

I said, “That was intentional.” 

“You’re telling me,” replied Hall. 

“I mean that it wasn’t a booby 
trap. We’ve been tested in various 
ways, and come through the tests. 
Now we’ve been reduced to the 
status of primitive man . .” 

“All right. I believe you. What 
do we do now?” 

“The only thing we can do. 
Carry on.” 

So we carried on in the pitch 
darkness. I stayed in the lead. Sue 
put her two hands on my waist, 
just above the hips. Hall, bringing 
up the rear, kept in touch with the 
girl in the same way. I shuffled 
ahead through the blackness. I was 
scared — and had every right to be. 

I screamed when I felt the floor 
tilt beneath me. I heard Sue 
scream, and heard the spaceman 
curse. I tried to check my descent 
down the chute with knees and 
elbows, but could get no purchase 
on the polished sides. I was aware 
of light, and remembered the trap 
into which we had almost fallen. 
But this light was blue, and not red, 
and there was no fire waiting to re- 

91 



THE MAZE 




ceive us in the vast cavern into 
which we tumbled— no fire but bit- 
ter cold that seared our exposed 
flesh almost as a flame would have 
done. 

The light seemed to have no 
source. It seemed to come from the 
air itself — the dry, still, bitterly 
cold air. Our breath condensed into 
little clouds of sparkling frost crys- 
tals. 

“Keep moving!” shouted Hall. 
“Keep moving!” 

“Where to?” asked Sue reason- 
ably enough. 

“Wait a minute,” I said. 
“There’s a clue here — or another 
test. Or both.” 

“What do you mean?” asked the 
others. 

“This cave is cold. It’s meant to 
be cold. But here are the means of 
survival.” 

I walked across to the untidy lit- 
ter of dry sticks and twigs, kicked 
it. Judging by the sound it made, 
the wood was as dry as it looked. 

“So we’re supposed to make a 
fire,” said Sue slowly. Her voice was 
shaky — but that was caused by cold 
rather than by fear. 

“Yes,” I said. 

“How?” she asked. 

“You’re an archaeologist, you 
should know. Or don’t you study 
primitive man?” I squatted down, 
began rummaging in the debris. I 
found a flat piece of fairly soft 
wood, a straight stick with a fairly 
sharp point to it. “Primitive man 
knew how to make fire without 
pocket lighters.” 

“Can you do it, George?” asked 
Hall. 

92 



“I don’t know, Sam. I’ve never 
tried before.” 

I found another length of wood 
that would do for a bow, strung it 
with what remained of my reel of 
cord. (That cord was eventually of 
use to us.) I took a couple of turns 
with the bowstring round the 
pointed stick, stood on the flat piece 
of wood and held the pointed stick 
upright between my boots. I began 
to saw the bow back and forth. 

“I don’t think that anybody will 
mind if we cheat a little,” said Hall 
at last. “This is fascinating to 
watch — but it seems to be a long 
time in getting results. Whatever 
the radiation was that destroyed our 
metals it didn’t affect organic com- 
pounds. My pistol holster is full of 
dust — and some of that will be the 
powder from cartridges . .” 

He poured some of the dust from 
his holster into the hollow I had 
worn in the flat piece of wood. He 
tore pages from his notebook and 
placed them around the firestick. I 
resumed my sawing — and did not 
have long to wait for results. I es- 
caped with an only slightly 
scorched foot — and in a very short 
time we had a cheerful blaze going. 

We sat down around it, grateful 
for the heat. We thawed our water 
bottles and drank. We nibbled the 
food concentrates with their deli- 
cate flavour of old sawdust. We be- 
gan to feel a little better. 

We discussed the advisability of 
sleep, then decided against it. The 
problem of which way to continue 
our exploration next exercised our 
minds. It was Sue who pointed out 
that the smoke from our fire did 
not stream straight up but drifted 

BERTRAM CHANDLER 




? 



lazily towards the far end of the 
cave. It was Sue — she was catching 
on — ^who suggested that we take 
with us torches and a good supply 
of spares. I agreed with her. The 
nature of this clue argued that we 
should have need of fire again. 

We trudged what seemed like 
miles over the dry, sandy floor. 
Now and again we came upon 
more deposits of the dry sticks and, 
but more rarely, evidence of long 
dead (how long dead we didn’t 
care to think) fires. At last we 
reached the sheer, smooth cliff that 
was the far wall of the cavern. 

There was a strong draught into 
a gloomy tunnel mouth. We fol- 
lowed the smoke of our torches, 
making fair progress over the sandy 
floor. Other tunnels opened to left 
and to right of us, but we ignored 
them, following the smoke. 

We heard rustlings — ahead of us, 
behind us — in the side tunnels. We 
heard something croaking. I looked 
back — and saw eyes glowing crim- 
son in the torchlight. I heard Hall 
cry out — and saw more eyes ahead 
of us. 

“Don’t stop!” ordered Hall. 
“They, whatever they are, will be 
afraid of fire!” 

“They might be attracted by it,” 
I said. “But, in any case, we’re sur- 
rounded.” 

Slowly we advanced. The glow- 
ing eyes ahead of us held their 
ground. There must have been at 
least six animals there, assuming 
that they had one pair of eyes 
apiece. 

Hall shouted. He lit another 
torch from the half consumed one 
in his hand. Waving both torches 

THE MAZE 



he ran forward. There was a scuf- 
fle and a high pitched squealing. 
The eyes vanished. The spaceman 
hurled one of his blazing brands 
after them. Something screamed. 

“Another of your tests, or lessons, 
or clues,” panted Hall. “The lower 
animals are afraid of fire — and 
they’re more scared of us than we 
are of them. Lord! What a stink! 
It smells like a fire in a featherbed 
factory!” 

And then we saw light ahead — 
not cold blue, not ruddy, but yel- 
low, like sunlight 



W E COULD NOT even make 
a guess as to the extent of the 
next cavern. Its lofty roof was hid- 
den by grey mists, as were the fur- 
ther walls. Furthermore, it was a 
huge hothouse teeming with luxuri- 
ant, brilliantly green vegetation. 
What the trees and the shrubs were 
I cannot say. They were similar, 
perhaps, to rain forest growths on 
Earth. They bore no resemblance 
to the leathery, ragged trees on the 
surface of Mars. 

The air was hot, humid, and full 
of strange, strong scents that made 
us drowsy. We shed our outer cloth- 
ing, but we didn’t dare to leave 
either it or our equipment behind; 
neither did we dare to dump our 
torches and our supply of dried 
sticks. 

There was a path for us to fol- 
low. I didn’t like it — ^it was all too 
obviously made by the regular pas- 
sage of some huge, heavy beast. 
But we had now no means of hack- 
ing our own way through the 
jungle. 



93 




There were things in the under- 
growth, aii^ong the trees. We heard 
them rustling and calling to each 
other, but we never saw them. We 
hoped that they weren’t hostile — 
we had no weapons but our torches. 
Even so, we soon abandoned all 
attempts to walk silently. We 
weren’t bushmen, and the only end 
achieved by our caution was to slow 
our progress. 

The thing that came after us 
wasn’t cautious either. It didn’t 
need to be. It was at least as large 
as an Earthly elephant and had a 
mouth that could have swallowed 
a cow. I can’t describe it. I didn’t 
stop to look at it. 

“Run!” I yelled to Sue, gave her 
a push that sent her reeling down 
the track. I wasted no time in fol- 
lowing her. I assumed that Hall 
would follow suit. 

As I have said before, he was a 
brave man. But bravery, carried 
to extremes, is foolhardiness, I 
heard him yell, and paused in my 
flight. I turned round and saw him. 

He wasn’t running, he was walk- 
ing. He was walking towards the 
monster, waving a flaming torch 
in each hand. Perhaps it had never 
seen fire before — in any case fire 
is not nearly so impressive when 
seen in broad daylight or its equiv- 
alent. 

The beast never even paused in 
its ponderous advance. One mas- 
sive, armored foot smashed Hall 
into the ground. He started a 
scream, but never finished it. There 
was nothing that I could do. 

When I resumed my flight I saw 
that Sue had vanished. 

94 



It was another of those pitfalls of 
which the maker of the Maze was 
so fond. I found it when the ground 
opened suddenly beneath me — and 
not a moment too soon either. 
Once again I was in darkness, once 
again I was falling. But this time 
it was different. On past occasions 
it had been a straight drop; there 
had been no gut wrenching twists, 
no sensation of being turned in- 
side out, no consciousness of the 
passage of aeons of time. 

I was sprawled on soft grass — 
by the feel of it — and somebody 
was holding me very tight. I opened 
my eyes, and saw Sue’s face. I saw 
the sky — the night sky and the 
stars, and the yellow, full moon, 
with its familiar markings, almost 
at the zenith. My body, when I 
tried to raise myself to a sitting 
posture, was oddly heavy. 

“I thought you were never com- 
ing through,” she said. 

I asked, absurdly enough, 
“Where am I?” 

I saw her smile. 

“There’s your clue,” she said, 
pointing to the moon. “We’re on 
Earth. But just where I can’t say. 
Somewhere in the Tropics is my 
guess . 

“There must be a town or village 
close by,” I said. “We must get to 
a radio transmitter at once.” 

“Must we?” she asked. “Con 
we?” 

“What do you mean?” 

“While I was waiting for you I 
saw a tiger — ^but far bigger than 
any tiger I’ve ever seen in a zoo. 
And it had teeth too long for its 
mouth . .” 

“Sue! What are you suggesting?” 
BERTRAM CHANDLER 




“Oh, I know it’s fantastic. But 
we’ve quite calmly accepted the 
idea of teleportation through 
Space. It’s been through Time as 
well. Don’t ask me how, or 
why . .” 

“You can ask me why,” I said. 
“It’s all beginning to make sense. 
The Maze isn’t a puzzle so much as 
a school — a school designed to 
teach lessons in primitive living. 
Our last lesson — but I wish we 
hadn’t learned it at Sam’s expense 
— ^is that it is sometimes wiser to 
run than to stand and fight . 

“But what for?” she asked. 

“This is only a guess,” I said, 
“but will have to do. There was — 
or will be — this war between the 
Martians and the beings of the 
Fifth Planet. Mars was ruined — 
the Fifth Planet utterly destroyed. 
But the Fifth Planet must have had 
a large and dreadfully armed fleet 
that survived the catastrophe. The 
surviving Martians escaped both in 
Time and Space. 

“They decided to start from 
scratch, literally, on Earth, They 
knew that if they built up a tech- 
nological civilization too fast they 
might either attract the attention of 
their enemies or, possibly, develop 
space travel and interfere with 
their own history as Martians. I 
don’t know if you’ve read any time 
travel stories — ^but they’re full of 
paradoxes. The makers of the Maze 
were determined to avoid them.” 

“You may have something,” she 
said slowly. “It may account for 
the true men co-existing with the 
Neanderthaler. Neanderthal Man 
must have been the aborigine — ^his 
supplanter an invader . 

THE MAZE 



Something roared not too far 
away. Something else screamed. 
We remembered the last lesson of 
the Maze and spent what should 
have been — but somehow wasn’t 
— a miserable night in a tree. 

We survived. We found ourselves 
a cave when the daylight came and 
moved in. We used the powder re- 
maining in my holster to start a 
fire. We learned — sometimes by 
painful experience — what berries 
were edible and what weren’t. We 
managed to snare the occasional 
not-quite-rabbit. I even — and of 
this I still feel proud — ^managed to 
make a quite deadly bow and a set 
of arrows. It brought down a small 
deer. 

In a way I am sorry that our 
lonely life is now finished — ^but we 
have decided to join the band of 
nomads who have camped in oiu: 
valley. They’re friendly enough 
people, and I don’t think that we 
shall have much trouble in learn- 
ing their language. They have 
spears, but not the bow — Sue tells 
me no depiction of a bow has ever 
been found in Martian records or 
statuary — so it looks as though I 
shall be able to make quite a good 
living by manufacturing that wea- 
pon. Sue tells me, too, that they 
are, at the most, but two gener- 
ations removed from the original 
Martian colonists. 

There is very little pencil left, 
and I am on the last sheet of paper. 
I will bury this record, and then we 
will go to join — ^but not in the 
Biblical sense — our ancestors. 

“But we’re ancestors ourselves,” 
Sue has just reminded me. END

BY GEORGE REVELLE 




W ADE BOEMAN let his eyes 
wander up the hull of the 
huge silver ship. He thought; if 
only Tomer were here now! He 
caught himself and quickly erased 
the thought before he remembered 
more . things that were better left 
alone, hidden behind the thin veil 
he had created in his mind. 

The quick blink of a signal light 
from the tower caught the comer 
of his eye. H-hour minus fifteen 
minutes. The ground crews had 
cleared the area. He hadn’t noticed. 
He turned to the huge, blond man 
standing beside him. 

“Well, Allen. This is it. I’ve 
checked everything myself. You 
should have no trouble. Be sure 
and strap yourself in tightly and 
don’t forget to check the gyro. Its 
the only thing we can’t double 
check from the tower.” 

“You’re all through instructing 



There are all kinds of heroes. And the irony of it all lies in the 



fact that the bravest are those who are unknown and unsung.

now, teacher"^ the blond man said. 
“I can take it from here. And I 
can’t say I’m sorry.” 

Wade wanted to say then all the 
little things that had been building 
up within him during the past long 
months. He bit back the words. It 
took much effort. 

He said: “Good luck, Captain. 
I really mean it.” 

Allen gave him a tight smile. 
“Drop dead. Colonel.” 

Wade dropped his outstretched 
hand as the big man ignored him. 
Ackerson turned his back and be- 
gan to climb the metal rungs lead- 
ing up the hull of the ship. 

Tomer, Wade thought. If only 
it could be Tomer instead of Acker- 
son. 

He waited until the blond man 
entered the hatch before he climbed 
into the jeep. He glanced once 
more at the silver hull of the Star- 
frosty then he jammed down on the 
accelerator. Hate was a word Wade 
seldom used. There was too much 
of it in the world already. But he 
was beginning to hate Ackerson. 

He parked the jeep beside the 
concrete and steel structure housing 
Operations. The instant his hand 
touched the door handle he tried 
to cease being Wade Boeman the 
man. He tried to become Colonel 
Wadon G. Boeman, senior officer 
in charge of ‘Operation Boomer- 
ang,’ with no personal feelings. It 
didn’t come off fully. 

The four walls were lined with 
banks of instruments. Small lights 
flickered and died, only to come 
alive again the next instant. A 
man coughed. 

He nodded at a communications 



man, a civilian, as he hurried to the 
small table where the television set 
was resting. The closed circuit 
showed the Star frost resting alone 
on the sand with her nose pointed 
toward the sky. 

He took off his cap, then lighted 
a cigarette. He checked his wrist 
watch with the large clock on the 
wall. He set the sweep second hand 
to coincide with the larger one. 

“Twelve minutes. Colonel,” 
someone behind Wade said. 

He wiped his dry lips as he 
flicked his eyes in the direction of 
the Major in charge of the control 
panel. The Major gave him a tight 
smile. Wade nodded. Major 
Gormely was a good man . they 
were all good men. Wade felt 
proud to be part of the team. 

He took in the radar man check- 
ing the never-ending sweep of the 
beam. Frank Piluis, a tall, lanky 
man of twenty-three. He was 
checking the screen, adjusting, as 
if his own life depended on its 
operation instead of a man he 
hardly knew. 

Wade checked his own screen 
again. 

The Starfrost was so silent . 
so latent ... so important. Wade 
found Tomer creeping into his 
thoughts again. He shut the thought 
out quickly. Wade was a military 
man. He had orders to forget 
Tomer. He gave orders. He also 
had to take them. 

Wade became mindful of some- 
one standing behind him. He 
turned. The man was tall, wearing 
the cloak of authority in the very 
way he smiled. Distinguished look- 
ing streaks of gray ran over his once

brown hair. Tiny wrinkles at the 
eyes told that he was a man with a 
sense of humor even though pressed 
with responsibility. 

“A penny for your thoughts, 
Wade,” The Secretary of Defense 
said as Boeman got up. Wade won- 
dered if the man had been in the 
control room all the time. He 
hadn’t seen him. 

‘‘They aren’t worth it, Harry,” 
he answered, offering his hand. 

“As bad as that,” the Secretary 
laughed. “Here we are on the edge 
of a History making moment and 
you’re wasting your time with 
worthless thoughts.” 

Worthless thoughts. Wade won- 
dered if they were, really. 

Wade first met Harry Lowe a 
long time ago when the project was 
just a dream on the drawing 
boards. Since that time he had 
come to know the Secretary in- 
timately. Now, suddenly, he felt 
awkward before the man. Perhaps 
it was because Lowe seemed to 
have a special talent for reading 
peoples’ expressions, converting 
them into sentences. Like now, 
Wade felt the man was reading 
his face like a book. 

“That’s right, Harry. History is 
being made isn’t it?” 

The Secretary’s face became very 
serious. “More than that, Wade, 
Perhaps salvation depends on it.” 
“Ten minutes,” a voice said. 
Wade nodded at the technician. 
Tiny lights came into play on the 
control panel as Major Gormely 
began closing circuits. The com- 
munications man made a final type 
check on the huge P.C.R. set. 
^^Starfrdst. This is Mother. How

do you read me? Over.” 

“Mother. This is Starfrost. Loud 
and clear. Five by five.” Ackerson’s 
strong voice came from the loud- 
speaker located in the center of the 
equipment. “Oxygen checks. I’ve 
bedded down. Give the Colonel my 
love.” 

The radio man looked at Wade, 
There had been no mistaking the 
sarcasm in Ackerson’s voice. Wade 
felt his face grow red. 

“He hasn’t changed,” he heard 
the Secretary say. 

“No. He hasn’t changed.” Wade 
said softly. 

“Don’t let it throw you, Wade. 
“You’ve done a good job. We both 
know that nothing counts but the 
Project.” 

Nothing counts but the project. 
Personal feelings, ideals, not even 
human lives. Nothing counts but 
the project. How many times had 
he said that to himself, trying to be 
convincing. 

“It’s Tomer. Isn’t it?” the Sec- 
retary said. 

Wade’s eyes locked with those of 
the older man. There was no sense 
going over that now. They had had 
it out a dozen times already. 

“That and other things,” he said. 

“Like Ackerson’s attitude, I sup- 
pose.” 

“Like Ackerson’s attitude.” 

The Secretary gave a tight smile. 
“We all have reasons for doing 
things, Wade. To you this is a mili- 
tary feat that could spell security 
for years to come. To me it does 
that and more. It could be the 
opening of a new frontier, some- 
thing that will provide a new out- 
let for humanity instead of war.” 

99 




Wade said: “And to Ackerson it 
will mean fame and fortune. Noth- 
ing more. His name will go in the 
history books. There will be per- 
sonal appearances, contracts, mon- 
ey. He has no feelings at all about 
what this will mean to his country.” 

The Secretary nodded. “You’re 
a professional military man, Wade, 
You’re making it your life. I under- 
stand how you feel.” 

Wade laughed bitterly, inside. 
Did Harry know how he felt? Did 
he think that military men were 
just brass and polish with no feel- 
ings, no friends to worry about, no 
cares outside of regulations and or- 
ders! 

“Eight minutes.” The voice came 
again. 

Wade left the Secretary, went to 
the mike resting on the communi- 
cations desk. 

''Starfrost, This is Mother,” he 
said. 

“Go ahead. Mother.” Ackerson 
recognized his voice. 

“Double check everything. Re- 
peat. Double check everything, 
oxygen, hammock straps, loose ob- 
jects, everything.” 

“Relax, Mother! You sound like 
you’re going to have another baby.” 
Ackerson laughed over the loud- 
speaker. 

Wade gave the mike back to the 
radio man carefully. He walked 
back to the small television screen 
and sat down. The Star frost 
looked like a silver monument 
standing alone out there on the 
sand. Soon there would be nothing 
there but sand. Wade felt like a 
mother hen waiting for her first 
egg. 

100 



He adjusted the contrast, bright- 
ened the picture. Perhaps the Sec- 
retary was right. Everyone had 
their reasons for doing things. He 
wondered what Tomer’s were? 

“Do you think he will make it, 
Wade?” 

The Secretary sat down on the 
edge of the desk. He looked out of 
place. He should have been behind 
one, a large mahogany one. 

“I think he will,” Wade said 
softly. “The test ship we sent made 
it. There is no reason to believe 
a ship with a man in it should fail.” 
“Do you want him to make it?” 
The words jarred Boeman. He 
searched the l^cretary’s face. “Of 
course I do. What makes you say 
a thing like that?” 

The Secretary toyed with his tie. 
He said nothing. 

Wade got up. He could feel the 
anger begin to seep through his 
body. “You know what this trip 
means to me — to the country.” He 
faced the gray-haired man square- 
ly. “If you’re insinuating that I 
want him to fail because I disagree 
with his reasons for volunteering, 
you’re wrong. Dead wrong.” 

Wade found himself lighting a 
cigarette. “Sure. I dislike Ackerson. 
Dislike him violently. I’ve taken 
more lip from him in the past 
months then I’ve taken during my 
entire life. And when he returns 
that will be finished or I’ll finish 
him. One way or another.” Wade 
inhaled deeply. “It’s the project 
that counts. Only the project. It’s 
bigger than one man . it’s bigger 
than all of us put together.” 

Lowe smiled. His face seemed 
younger. “I knew you felt that way, 

GEORGE REVELLE 




Wade. I just wanted you to say it 
for your own benefit. Perhaps it 
will make this entire thing easier 
for you.” 

The Secretary moved then, over 
to the communication panel. 

“Three minutes,” someone said. 

Wade looked at the narrow back 
of Harry Lowe. And he knew how 
the man became Secretary of De- 
fense. It was shrewd getting him to 
open up like that. They both knew 
how lucky they were to have Allen 
Ackerson. Finding men capable of 
making such a flight hadn’t been 
easy. Of the dozen volunteers only 
Ackerson remained. Mental and 
physical tests had eliminated all but 
a few. Those remaining were unfit 
for space travel, weeded out by the 
psychological teams, unable to cope 
with the morbid phobia of being 
alone so long wrapped in a metal 
cocoon. Only Ackerson and 
Tomer had succeeded. Now there 
was only Ackerson. 

“Colonel!” Wade turned and 
faced the rawboned sergeant stand- 
ing beside him. Meyers was a big 
man with a deep tan browning his 
face. 

“What is it, sergeant?” 

Meyers handed him a large 
white envelope. “Captain Acker- 
son said to give this to you just be- 
fore take-off.” 

“Thanks, sergeant.” 

“Two minutes,” someone said. 
Wade stuffed the envelope inside 
his jacket. Then he hurried over to 
the radar man. The envelope had 
to wait, there was no time now. 

“Are we set?” he asked. The 
man nodded as he adjusted the 
dials. Wade smiled. These men 



were experts in their fields. To dou- 
ble check them would be to insult 
them. Besides, this wasn’t the first 
time for them. The same crew had 
been operating when they fired the 
test rocket. He knew they wouldn’t 
fail. 

“One minute ... 59 ... 58 .. 
57 . Wade found himself count- 
ing under his breath while he stared 
at the small screen on the table. 
Would the reactors work? They 
would go on at 30. And the Star- 
frosti Would it lift — or would it, 
like some others before it, slowly 
hesitate, then begin a weird, fright- 
ening slide to the side to become a 
flaming blowtorch of death. 

“30!” Major Gormely closed the 
switch. Wade became conscious of 
the Secretary watching the screen 
with him. 

“... 5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 
. .” The counter continued. 
“FIRE!” 

The Starfrost shivered. 

Wade felt his heart skip a beat. 
Slowly, ever so slowly, the huge 
ship began to move. Dust, sand and 
smoke mingled with the sheets of 
flame pouring from her stern. The 
platform disappeared in a puff of 
smoke. 

The Starfrost lifted. 

“Thank God!” the Secretary 
sighed. 

“Amen.” Wade muttered. He 
took out another cigarette. He was 
glad it had begun; the project. 
Now there was only the long wait. 

“Ackerson’s a brave man.” The 
Secretary said. 

“Of course he is.” Wade never 
had any doubts about Allen’s in- 
testinal fortitude. The man had a 



OPERATION BOOMERANG 



101 




good war record. Confidence 
seemed to ooze out of the man. It 
was his attitude, damn it. 

Wade drew deeply on the ciga- 
rette. Tomer had been the same 
type in many ways. Eager, filled 
with the enthusiasm, unafraid. A 
small man compared to the blond 
Ackerson, he seemed to carry him- 
self tall. And his attitude. He felt 
the same intensity about National 
defense as Boeman did himself. 
Perhaps that was another reason 
he had felt close to the boy. Tomer 
would have made this trip with no 
thought whatsoever about the fi- 
nancial rewards or what the his- 
tory books would have to say about 
him. 

. Sixty thousand . some- 
one said. 

“Start communication,” Wade 
commanded automatically. 

“Romeo.” The commo picked 
up the small hand mike. All eyes 
in the room centered on the silent 
speaker on the wall. 

""Starfrost. This is Mother. How 
do you read me, over?” 

The speaker remained silent. 
frost. Can you read me. 

Over!” 

The Secretary looked at Wade. 
His face was tight and drawn. 
“What do you think, Wade. Are 
we getting through?” 

“It’s hard to say. He’s moving 
pretty fast. He could outrun the 
signal. We’ve never had a practical 
voice test.” 

Lowe’s face had a worried ex- 
pression covering it. “Didn’t you 
have communications with the test 
rocket?” 



“That was unmanned ... re- 
member?” 

“This silence doesn’t worry you?” 
the Secretary asked with amaze- 
ment. 

“Ackerson was trained for this. 
He knows there is nothing we can 
do for him. He^s on his own. Com- 
munications would be to our ad- 
vantage, to be sure. But Ackerson 
knows that ship like you know the 
back of your hand. Besides . , per- 
haps he is too busy to answer right 
now. He has to be sure there is no 
wobble.” 

“Wobble!” 

“Sure. The ship could begin to 
oscillate. If it does that he is done. 
He has to keep his eye on the gyro.” 

The Secretary’s eyes penetrated. 
“I can’t help but feel that you 
would be more concerned if Tomer 
were in the Star frost instead of 
Ackerson. Wade . don’t let the 
fact that you hate Ackerson cloud 
the issue. He is doing us a great 
service.” 

“Stop it, Harry!” 

“After all. The first man to circle 
the Moon is entitled to a place in 
the history books. I can share his 
feelings, in a way. It’s a great thing 
he’s doing.” 

“Others have done more,” Wade 
said sharply. 

“Of course they have. But re- 
member one thing. If Ackerson 
succeeds we will get the appropria- 
tions we need to build up there on 
that cold chunk of rock. We need 
that . need it badly.” 

“I tell you we have nothing to 
worry about yet,” Wade said quick- 

“Have it your way, Wade. But 
GEORGE REVELLE 



102 




remember, we can’t land on the 
Moon until we have appropriations 
for installations. It all takes money; 
landing sites, protection against the 
elements, and most important, take- 
off facilities. It’s a big order. Acker- 
son can give us all of that if he is 
successful. The public will back us 
to the limit if we prove we have 
mastered space travel.” The Secre- 
tary watched Wade carefully. 
“Ackerson is important!” 

“I never said he wasn’t.” 

“I know, Wade.” The Secretary 
toyed with his tie. “But did you let 
your feelings toward Tomer inter- 
fere with your attitude toward 
Ackerson! He came to me you 
know, about halfway through the 
course. He said you were babying 
Tomer to the point where it was 
interfering with his instruction.” 
“He lied,” Wade cut in. He 
threw down the cigarette he was 
holding and ground his heel into it. 
“You know me better than that!” 
“Of course. But perhaps Acker- 
son did have something. Perhaps 
you spent mpre time with Tomer 
than you intended. Unconsciously 
you may have favored him to the 
point where Ackerson did suffer.” 
Wade let his eyes wander over to 
the small television screen. It was 
still operating. Flat, empty sand 
and a burned out area was all that 
remained of the Star frost He won- 
dered: Did I do that? Did I forget 
to teach Ackerson something while 
I was working with Tomer? 

The loud-speaker crackled. 
“Mother. This is Starfrost 
Over.” 

The operations room came alive. 
Wade and Lowe hurried over to 



stand beneath the speaker, as if 
that would put them closer to the 
Starfrost, 

“Go ahead, Starfrost This is 
Mother.” The communications man 
held the mike in a hand that wasn’t 
quite as steady as it should be. 

“This is Starfrost, Everything in 
the green. Repeat, ever^^hing in 
the green. Over.” 

Wade took the mike. “How is the 
gyro, StarfrostV 

The loud-speaker laughed. “Tsk, 
tsk. Colonel. Where is your radio 
procedure? You forgot to say over.” 
There was a pause and Boeman 
knew why. “Don’t tell me you’re 
worrying about ole Ack. I’ve got 
this thing sewed up. Why don’t you 
take a walk around the park and 
see if you can find that little guy? 
What was his name? You know the 
one I mean. The one who got cold 
feet and dropped out before you 
finished feeding him. Over.” 

Wade handed the mike back to 
the commo man without a word. 
He looked at the Secretary. Lowe’s 
eyes cautioned him. Wade swal- 
lowed the things he was going to 
say. Orders. Damn them. He 
wanted to stick a pin in Ackerson’s 
ego. And it would be so easy. So 
damn easy. Orders. He gave them 
and he had taken them. 

Wade turned and got the mike 
again. “This is Mother. Keep an 
eye on the hull temperature. Watch 
that gyro. If you feel the slightest 
vibration be sure to start the aux- 
iliary immediately. Over.” 

“Romeo, Mother. Take care of 
my letter. I — ” the speaker became 
silent. 

Major Gormely moved like a 



OPERATION BOOMERANG 



103 




blur of light. Wade knew what was 
wrong the instant he looked at the 
pip on the radar scope. Major 
Gormely hurriedly began checking 
instruments. But he had seen too. 
The equipment was in order. It 
was the Starfrost. It had all indica- 
tions of a “wobble”. 

“This is serious, isn’t it, Wade?” 
Boeman didn’t look at the Secre- 
tary when he answered. His eyes 
were glued to the radar scanner. 
“Pretty much. It could be the end 
if he doesn’t catch it in time.” 
“What can we do!” 

“Nothing but wait. He isn’t fin- 
ished yet. He has the extra gyro. 
That should do it. If not he can 
try the fuel as a last resort. It’s only 
theory plus but he might be able to 
blast something with substance 
against the dorsel fin. If he plays it 
carefully he might be able to give 
the gyro a hand. It will be tricky 
but we think it can be done.” 
“What effect will that have on 
the mission? He has only so much 
fuel!” 

“He can waste thirty seconds. 
After that he is cutting himself 
short on the leg home.” 

“The wobble stopped,” Major 
Gormely said quickly. 

It was true. The course was 
slightly erratic but Ackerson had 
the Starfrost back under control, 
Wade wiped the back of his hand 
over his lips. Suddenly he felt tired 
and old. He wanted to sit down. 
“Keep trying on the radio, Mike,” 
he said. 

He walked over to the small ta- 
ble with the television set on it. He 
switched it off. He didn’t want to 
look at that empty sand. He lighted 

104 



another cigarette. Then he reached 
inside his blouse and withdrew the 
letter Ackerson had left for him. He 
didn’t want to read it. For the first 
time he had felt close to the blond 
man . felt sorry for him. The 
letter could say something to 
change that. 

“Why don’t you read it, Wade?” 
the Secretary said. 

Wade looked up quickly. The 
Secretary was smiling with that 
know-all look of his. Wade reached 
in his pocket and brought out the 
pack of cigarettes. Then he caught 
himself. But the older man hadn’t 
missed the one smoldering in the 
ashtray. 

A tight smile creased Wade’s 
face. He felt like a small boy caught 
with his hand in the cookie jar. “I 
know a nice quiet spot in upper 
New York. Phonecia! There’s a 
nice trout stream beside the only 
hotel. The people are simple and 
tolerant. And there is a small, pri- 
vate bar where a man can really re- 
lax. I think I’ll go up there for a 
few years when this is all over.” 
“Now you’re reading my mind.” 
the Secretary said. 

They both laughed. 

“Seriously, Wade. I think you 
should take a long rest when this is 
over. A man with your knowledge 
of the human body should realize 
that you’re fighting fatigue. In fact 
I’ve already spoken to General 
Dominick about it.” 

Wade shook his head. “You 
know I can’t do that. I’ve got an- 
other job I have to take care of 
first.” 

“Tomer?” 

“Of course.” 



GEORGE REVELLE 




“I thought we settled on that. 
Someone else can take over in your 
place and handle that. You can 
supervise if you wish. But not until 
after you’ve had a rest.” 

“You know better, Harry. This 
is my baby and I’ll handle it. It 
isn’t that I haven’t tried to keep 
him out of my mind. I have. Yet he 
always comes back to haunt me. If 
not because of my own feelings, 
then it’s Ackerson reminding me. 
It’s no use. I can’t rest with him on 
my mind.” 

“Not even when you’ve had or- 
ders?” 

Wade snuffed out the cigarette. 
“I’m finding out that feelings can 
sometimes rebel against orders.” 

“That isn’t a good trait for an 
Army Officer to acquire.” 

Wade’s face took on a sardonic 
expression. “No. It isn’t, is it?” he 
said softly. 

The time piece on the wall was 
broken. It had to be. Wade had 
been watching it for hours and it 
hardly seemed to move. The Star- 
frost had disappeared behind the 
dark side of the Moon and a press 
release had been duly passed on to 
the anxious public. The world was 
electrified. Man had ventured into 
space. The public hadn’t been told 
that there was no communication 
with the Starfrost, It was better 
that way. 

Wade fished for another ciga- 
rette as he followed the sweep sec- 
ond hand with his eyes. It was 
ironic, in a way. Man had ventured 
to the Moon and could not land. 
He dared not. To set foot on the 
cold, dead satellite when there was 

OPERATION BOOMERANG 



no possible way of return would be 
inviting suicide. The test rocket 
fired at the silent world, and the 
St at frost had eaten up the last of 
the appropriations and it would 
take a battery of ships to car^ the 
supplies necessary for the building 
of take-off facilities. 

That was what Wade wanted, an 
installation on the Moon before 
another nation could make it. It 
was no secret that the nation that 
controlled the Moon in the next 
war would be in the driver’s seat. 
It would be a fortress in the sky. 
And it was no secret that another 
nation was almost ready to launch 
a ship. Wade wanted to get there 
first. 

Wade could feel the sweat on his 
hands. They felt cold and clammy. 
The Star frost should have reap- 
peared on the radar set an hour 
ago. He dared not think of what 
would happen to Ackerson if the 
big blond man miscalculated while 
in orbit. To shoot off alone into 
black, empty space, hurtling out 
into a void of nothing, where there 
was only a cold, quiet death await- 
ing was no way for a man to die. 

Damn it. Where was that silver 
cocoon? Ackerson had to make it. 
Everything depended on the suc- 
cess of the Starfrost, 

“I think I’ve got something,” 
Major Gormely cried. 

Wade came out of his dream 
world with a rush. His swift steps 
covered the distance to the radar 
set in a matter of seconds. 

Gormely was bending over work- 
ing with Pilius. And it was there 
... a tiny speck that could only be 
one thing. 

105 




Wade heard himself mutter: 
“Thank God!’’ 

The control room became a bee- 
hive of excitement. These men 
were accustomed to success in the 
face of overwhelming pessimism. 
Yet this was almost the ultimate. 
They were part of a team that had 
projected an earthbound object 
into space. Now it was coming 
home. “Operation Boomerang” was 
nearing fulfilment. The long hours 
of sweat and worry were beginning 
to pay off. The cork was ready to 
burst out of their bottled up emo- 
tions. 

Sergeant Meyers’ face was beam- 
ing. He was exuberant with excite- 
ment. “I guess that calls for a 
drink.” He took Wade by the arm. 
“I’ve been saving a quart of home- 
made com for just this occasion.” 
Suddenly Meyers stopped. His 
tan face became a gray mask. 

“. pardon me, Colonel . 
sir!” He came to rigid attention. 

Wade laughed heavily. “I think 
one drink would be in perfect or- 
der, sergeant. Where do you hide 
this liquid cob?” 

Meyers’ face became bright 
again. He almost tripped as he tried 
to salute, about-face, and run at 
the same time. He was going out 
the door when he called back over 
his shoulder. “In the water closet 
on one of the thrones in the latrine 
. Sir.” 



I T WAS Wade Boeman who 
ruined Allen Ackerson’s exit. He 
had the staff car pick up the pilot 
as soon as the hull of the Starfrost 
cooled. The official car had sped 



back over the barren sand, through 
the waiting throng of newsmen, 
straight to the small office located 
in the control building, without a 
stop. To say that it peeved Acker- 
son would be putting it mildly. His 
face was still burning with anger 
after twenty minutes of interroga- 
tion. Wade knew it was only the 
presence of the Defense Secretary 
keeping him in line. For that reason 
he tried to keep each question brief 
and simple. Ackerson was dying to 
get outside that door and receive 
some of the acclaim that he was 
being denied. 

“You say you had a chance to 
look at the test rocket we fired?” 
Wade asked. 

“Yes sir. It was resting in a red 
crater, fairly well beat up. It must 
have come down hard. In fact it 
looked like it may have struck a 
wobble at the last minute. Of 
course the terrain is pretty rough 
up there and it could have toppled 
after it hit. I’m sure the camera 
shots I took will tell us much 
more.” 

Wade felt a sudden twitch in his 
shoulder. “You said the crater was 
red.” 

“Yes, sir. A bright red. I thought 
it was strange. It was as if some- 
thing spilled out of the ship when 
she hit.” 

Wade and the Secretary ex- 
changed glances. 

“It was a marking dye so you 
could pick up the location of the 
ship,” Wade said too quickly. 

Allen twisted his head as the 
sound of many voices pierced the 
quiet room. Someone cheered loud- 
ly, Allen shifted his large frame. 

GEORGE REVELLE 



106 




“How was she lying?” Wade 
asked. 

Allen brought his attention back 
to the two men. It was obvious, he 
was becoming annoyed. “Down 
tail-first. The nose section looked 
intact. That’s what makes me be- 
lieve she took on a wobble at the 
last second. The nose should have 
been buried out of sight.” 

Another cheer forced its way into 
the room. Suddenly Allen burst out. 
“Tell me, Colonel. How’s Tomer 
these days. You remember, that lit- 
tle guy who quit on you just before 
the training ended.” 

The words had the effect the big 
man had hoped for. Boeman came 
out of the chair. His face was a 
vivid white. “You . .” he began. 

The Secretary moved quickly. 
He was between the two men be- 
fore Wade could continue. “That’s 
all for now Captain Ackerson,” he 
said, “or should I say Mister Ack- 
erson. Your papers have been proc- 
essed as you wished. You’re a 
civilian, after sixty days terminal 
leave, of course.” 

Ackerson watched the play of 
emotions on Wade’s face. He was 
enjoying every second of it. Wade 
wanted to smash that smug face all 
over the floor. Yet he was power- 
less. Ackerson was still an officer 
and there was too much left un- 
done to risk everything now. He sat 
back down on the chair. There 
would be time when the blond 
man was a civilian. 

“Thank you, sir.” Allen grinned. 
The Secretary extended his hand. 
“Congratulations again for a job 
well done.” They shook hands. 
“Don’t forget, Ackerson,” Boe- 

OPERATION BOOMERANG 



man said as Allen hurried to the 
door. “The next week is mine. 
Solid interrogation. You’re still in 
the service.” 

“And one more thing, Ackerson. 
I know your communication was 
working. Why didn’t you answer 
our calls?” 

“I thought that would make you 
sweat a little. I can see that it did.” 

The door slammed shut. 

Neither man spoke when the 
door closed behind Ackerson. The 
silence was long. Finally it was 
Boeman who moved. He opened 
the top left drawer of the desk and 
withdrew a small glass and a bottle. 
He poured a drink and offered it to 
the Secretary with a glance of his 
eyes. The Secretary shook his head. 

Boeman lifted the tumbler to his 
lips and poured the liquid down 
with a quick motion. He made a 
face as it burned. He poured an- 
other, toyed with it before he tossed 
it down. 

“Well, he made it.” Boeman said 
finally, placing the empty glass on 
the desk. “To the Moon and back 
— non stop.” 

“You knew he would, didn’t 
you.” 

Boeman nodded, staring at the 
glass. 

There was another awkward si- 
lence as both men were wrapped in 
thought. 

“Disappointed, Wade?” 

“Not disappointed. Disgusted.” 

“He gave us what we wanted. 
The appropriations will be easy 
now.” 

“I know.” 

107 




“Then what’s wrong. Certainly 
you can’t blame Ackerson fully. He 
doesn’t know the entire story.” 
“Perhaps that’s what’s wrong. If 
I could just tell the full story I 
might feel better.” 

“Impossible. Gan you imagine 
the entire nation carrying a load on 
its back the way you are now?” 
Wade laughed bitterly. “It might 
wake them up.” 

“I understand, Wade. My insides 
feel it too. But let him be the hero.” 
“He will be,” Wade said, reach- 
ing for the bottle again. “He will 
be.” 

“Then let him. We have more 
important things to think about 
now.” The Secretary got up. Wade 
grasped the empty tumbler in the 
palm of his hand, squeezing tightly. 
“Ackerson said red.” 

“I know,” replied the Secretary. 
“Red means danger. The crater 
should have been stained yellow.” 
“Perhaps there was a mix-up in 
containers.” 

“You don’t believe that, Frank.” 
“But the radio is still operating! 
A steady C.W. beam is coming in. 
If there was any danger we would 
be getting code.” 

Wade forced a smile. “You 
should have been a minister. There 
is always hope ... is that it?” 

The Secretary placed his hat 
carefully on his head. “I’d better 
get over to the lab and take a look 
at those movies he took.” 

“It must be so lonely . Boe- 
man said loosely. 

“Perhaps not. Tomer was a quiet 
man. Those kind don’t seem to 
mind.” 

A sudden, loud cheer broke the 



near silence in the room. Wade 
glanced toward the window. Then 
he got up slowly with the action of 
an old man. He went to the win- 
dow and looked out. 

Ackerson was being carried 
through a path of humanity aloft 
on dozens of shoulders. He was 
waving to the hundreds of well- 
wishers as he was carried toward 
the battery of microphones waiting 
on the wooden platform erected for 
the occasion. Wade couldn’t help 
but think of a hero of another age. 
Lindbergh. It must have been the 
same then. And who remembered 
those that followed him? Or those 
that paved the way so he could 
make it? Wade shook his head. 

He turned away from the win- 
dow quickly, heading for the desk 
and the bottle. The Secretary fol- 
lowed him with his eyes, undecided. 

Boeman lifted the bottle high 
above his head in a toasting gesture. 
“To the hero,” 

“Don’t, Wade.” 

The bottle paused there while 
the eyes of the two men met. Final- 
ly the bottle returned to the desk 
as Wade surrendered. Then he 
slumped down in the chair. 

The Secretary placed his hand 
on Wade’s shoulder. Boeman shook 
it off, and he was sorry instantly. 
“O.K. Frank. You win. Ackerson 
wins.” 

“Good,” the Secretary said soft- 
ly. “That’s the way we want it. We 
have to prevent everyone from feel- 
ing the way you do now. It isn’t 
that you’re jealous of Ackerson get- 
ting the glory. And you know that 
Tomer doesn’t mind. It’s your 
worrying about him that’s cloud- 

GEORGE REVELLE 



108 




ing your mind. Everyone would be 
feeling the same way.” 

The Secretary looked out the 
window. “We couldn’t have that. 
It would have set space travel back 
years. Ackerson is powerful evi- 
dence that space flight is safe. 
Tomer is our insurance. We need 
that just as badly. We had no 
choice. We had to stake a claim on 
the Moon.” 

Wade poured another drink. 
“And that conceited ass is getting 
all the credit while Tomer is sweat- 
ing it out up there on that cold 
chunk of rock — while everyone 
thinks he quit the project because 
he got cold feet.” 

“True.” The Secretary shook his 
head. “But Tomer is our ace-in- 
the-hole if the iron curtain an- 
nounces their intentions to land up 
there. 

“Tomer can be contacted. He 
can set off the signal for the world 
to see. In the meantime we will be 
working to make the next flight a 
complete one. It won’t take long. 
Tomer will manage.” 

“But Ackerson said the crater 
was red!” 

“I know. And I’m wasting time 
talking with you. I should be look- 
ing at those movies he took.” 

Wade didn’t watch the Secretary 
leave. He picked up the bottle and 
glass and went to the window. 



Down on the ramp the P.A. be- 
gan to crackle. Ackerson was be- 
ginning his speech. 

Wade took out the letter that 
Ackerson had sent to him. He took 
out a match and touched the flame 
to it. It was better that way. He 
was finished with Ackerson. He had 
a job to do now, one that would 
consume him. He had to get the 
Star frost II underway. He had to 
get there to get Tomer. 

Suddenly he understood. There 
were all kinds of heroes. Men like 
Ackerson were driven by the lure 
of fame and money. Tomer became 
one because the job had to be done 
and there was no one else to do it. 
Lowe was one, in a way, fighting 
for peace against a world that was 
always in unrest. In a way Wade 
himself might fall in one category. 
The thought made him smile. 

The Secretary was right, of 
course. The public would crucify 
them if they knew Tomer had been 
in the supposedly unmanned test 
rocket fir^ at the Moon with no 
way home. 

Wade lifted his drink high in the 
air as Ackerson’s deep voice carried 
into the room from the ramp be- 
low. “To a hero,” he said. “A lone- 
ly hero.” Wade’s eyes were on the 
sky when he said it, on a spot where 
the Moon would be some hours 
later, END

allow me to deliver him into the 
hands of friends, deliver him alive 
and safe. In return, I promise that 
your twelve-year-old body will 
leave this Earth virtually at once. 
I will send it to the colony on Mars, 
where it will stay until adulthood. 
Will you allow this?” 

The Scholar’s smile was thin. 
“And that is your only condition?” 

“My only one!” 

“Doctor — ” Ron stepped towards 
him. “You can’t leave things as 
they are — ” 

“Are you willing. Scholar? Will 
you let Ron Carver live his life in 
peace?” 

The Ron-body stiffened. 

“Yes,” he snapped. 

“Ron — ” the doctor waved to- 
wards him. “Hand him your gun.” 

“What?” 

“Give it to him! We’ve made a 
pact.” 

Ron hesitated, and then ex- 
tended the butt towards the Schol- 
ar. He took it with a slight bow, 
weighed it in his palm, and then 
slipped the weapon into his pocket. 

“You did wisely,” the doctor 
said, with noticeable relief. “If you 
had turned that gun on us. Schol- 
ar, I would have killed you on the 
spot.” He patted the metallic bulk 
beneath his own coat. “I came pre- 
pared, too . .” 

The copter rose serenely towards 
the heavenly vault. Ron’s small 
body was feeling the effects of the 
day’s strain. It collapsed against 
the leathery cushions, the short 



arms and legs limp and dangling. 

The doctor patted his knee. “An- 
other few moments,” he said. 
“Where are we going?” 

“To the spaceport in Winnipeg. 
I have a friend there. He has two 
children of his own, both born in 
the Mars Colony. He’ll be return- 
ing there within the week.” 

“And you want me to go with 
him?” 

“Yes, Ron. I want you to grow 
up all over again, and then return 
to Earth. It won’t be easy for you, 
but there will be advantages. Your 
life span has been lengthened. And 
right now, you know, you’re some- 
thing of a prodigy yourself.” He 
chuckled dryly. 

“And what happens here?” Ron 
said bitterly. “What kind of Earth 
will I find on my return?” 

“An older Earth. Perhaps a wiser 
Earth . .” 

“No, doctor.” Ron forced him- 
self to a sitting position. “Not with 
the Scholar alive and thriving, 
growing stronger and more intel- 
ligent with every passing year. It’ll 
be his Earth when I return . .” 
The doctor stared at the night 
sky before answering. 

“No, Ron. He’ll never live to see 
it. I knew that when I selected 
your body to house his mind . 
“What do you mean?” 

“I chose you for a reason, Ron. 
A vital reason. When you came to 
my office on your return from 
Andromeda, I discovered some- 
thing about you which made up 
my mind. An ailment without a 
name or a symptom, found only 
rarely in the bodies of a few space 
travelers. You had it, Ron, and in 

111 




a year or two, it would have struck 
you down with the savagery and 
surprise of lightning. 

“It was then that I agreed to the 
Scholar’s plan to exchange bodies. 
Agreed to it on my own terms, with 
the body of Ron Carver . .” 

“Then FU die!” Ron said. 

“No, Ron. You will live. It’s the 
Scholar who has made the bad 
bargain . .” 

In the distance, the lights of the 
Winnipeg spaceport blinked a wel- 
come. END 

HIDDEN TALENT 

(Continued from page 39) 

responded with a tinkle of coins. 

“Thank you, thank you,” he said. 
He pulled out a box full of colored 
globes, and began to juggle them 
without prologue. Within a few sec- 
onds he had five of them going at 
once — actually manipulated by tk, 
while he waved his hands impres- 
Mvely but meaninglessly beneath 
them. He sent up a sixth, then a 
seventh. 

He smiled pleasantly to himself 
as he juggled. Quite possibly these 
people had encountered telelunetics 
before, and had burned them for 
witches. But those were real tele- 
kinetics; he was only a sleight-of- 
hand artist, a man of exceptional 
coordination, a wandering charla- 
tan — a fake. Everyone knew ma- 
gicians were phonies, and that it 
was by tricky fingerwork that he 
kept all those globes aloft. 

When the shower of coins had 
stopped, he caught the balls and 
restored them to their box. He be- 
gan a new trick — one which in- 

1 



volved a rapid line of patter while 
he set up an elaborate balancing 
stunt. Piling chairs on top of thin 
planks and adding odd pieces of 
furniture from the back of his 
chariot to make the edifice even 
more precarious, he assembled a 
balanced heap some twelve feet 
high. He ran round it rapidly, os- 
tensibly guiding it with his hands, 
actually keeping the woodpile un- 
der a firm tk control. 

Finally he was satisfied with the 
balance. He began to climb slowly. 
When he reached the uppermost 
chair — ^balanced crazily on one of 
its legs alone — he climbed up, 
braced himself, and, by teeking 
against the ground, lifted himself 
and balanced for a long moment 
by one hand. Then he swung down, 
leaped lightly to the ground, and 
waved one hand in triumph. A clat- 
ter of coins resulted. 

This was the way, he thought, as 
the crowd roared its approval. 
They’d never suspect he was using 
a sort of real magic. He could prac- 
tice control of his psi in ordinary 
life, and this charlatanry would 
give him the needed outlet as well. 
When he returned to Earth, he’d be 
adjusted, more so than the ones 
like Dumb Joe. Davison was re- 
maining in society. He wasn’t run- 
ning away. 

A small boy in the first row stood 
up. “Aw, I know how you did 
that,” he shouted derisively. “It was 
just a trick. You had it all — ” 

“Don’t give the show away, son- 
ny,” Davison interrupted in a loud 
stage whisper. “Let’s just keep 
these things secret — between us ma- 
gicians, huh?” END

One of the dangers of future space 
travel may well be that of body 
waste. To throw out wastes would 
put the ship off its carefully plotted 
flight path, upset the conservation 
of total mass, and be impractical 
because of the tremendous speeds. 
Scientists working on the problem 
of sewage disposal in space are con- 
sidering incinerating or chemically 
changing wastes by solar energy, 
and reusing the treated wastes to 
grow algae. An alternative would 
be burning them with the heat gen- 
erated by supersonic flight; or pos- 
sibly using such wastes as fuel in 
the space ship’s propulsion system. 

Today^s housewife will probably 
need a diagram or map to find her 
way around in the pushbutton 
kitchen her daughter or grand- 
daughter will have twenty years 
from now. Today’s electric ranges 
and ovens in the wall will be re- 
placed by a marble counter top 
that heats to roast meat or bake 
a pie and then, in a moment or two, 
is cold enough to touch and use as 
a counter top or table. Ultrasonics, 
silent sound waves, will wash dishes 
in three minutes. Other gadets will 
include a serving cart, with self- 
contained motor, that runs itself 

113 



into the dining room with food and 
returns with the empty dishes, and 
an electrically-driven, partly-refrig^ 
erated turntable at the kitchen en- 
trance which will receive milk and 
groceries to save the housewife 
from having to leave the telephone 
or other activity to answer the door 
and put groceries away. A kind of 
electronic “brain” 'will produce the 
day’s menus, the housewife merely 
pushing button “two” or “five” or 
whatever she feels like. And a sim- 
ple touch to the sliding paneled 
walls will produce the cake that’s 
been baking, clean dishes or washed 
and ironed clothes. 

To protect the ears of an aircraft 
carrier’s personnel from the noise 
of future jet planes, an island struc- 
ture with a sound-proofed double 
wall has been suggested. Even now 
it is difficult or impossible for im- 
portant ship’s officers to communi- 
cate. With both turbojet engines at 
full power, the present military jet 
plane develops about 169 decibels, 
well above the limit of the largest 
power amplifier system and the 
threshold of painful noise. Jet 
planes of the next few years are ex- 
pected to rise to about 190 decibels. 
Since the noisiest time is when a 
jet plane is running up to full pow- 
er for a take-off, and since take-offs 
are spaced thirty seconds apart, the 
results to island personnel could be 
disastrous unless steps are taken to 
reduce the noise. 

A crash-proof car, whose safety in- 
novations could cut the death rate 
on the nation’s highways in half, is 
now in production. Passengers in 




the rolling safety package could 
emerge uninjured from a head-on 
collision at 50 miles per hour. Ex- 
ternally, the “crash-proof” car 
looks just like any other four-door 
sedan. Inside, however, there are 
some radical changes. The steering 
wheel has been eliminated and re- 
placed by a hydraulic, two-handled, 
lever-type control system set paral- 
lel to the floor. The steering device 
is covered with a chest cushion and 
beneath the chest protector is a 
body restraining U-shaped webbing 
yoke. Passenger and driver sit in 
bucket seats and the seats behind 
the driver face toward the rear. 
Doors are on rollers and move 
rearward, folding outward, like a 
single accordion pleat. Metal stiff- 
eners, similar to the “roll bars” for 
stock car racing, are buik into the 
roof. The passengers have chest 
pads and body yokes similar to 
those of the driver. The car has 
roof padding throughout, shock ab- 
sorber material between the bump- 
ers and the body frame, spring 
mounted wrap-around bumpers 
and an air scoop on the roof to 
minimize exhaust gases. 

Farmers of the future will be able 
to control the sex of their chicks 
before they are hatched. A new egg- 
dipping process, which forces 
hormones under pressure through 
the porous eggshell, is being experi- 
mented with, and results have been 
remarkably effective. Which will 
you have, hens or roosters? 

Creating new skulls for humans 
may soon be standard practice 
among plastic surgeons. Recent re- 

114 



ports have described such an opera- 
tion in which doctors removed 
four ribs from a child in four sep- 
arate operations and used them to 
cover the skull which had been 
crushed in an auto accident. The 
rib grafts form a scaffolding along 
which new skull bone is built; and 
the defect in the chest wall regener- 
ates with new rib in as little as 34 
days. Because the amount of bone 
available from ribs is almost un- 
limited, doctors of the future may 
look on ribs of the chest cage as a 
“bone bank within the human 
body.” 

Steps toward the direct conversion 
of atomic radiation into chemical 
energy, one of the most important 
objectives in atomic energy devel- 
opment, were revealed recently by 
the Brookhaven National Labora- 
tory. Ionizing radiations were used 
to oxidize an iron salt, ferrous sul- 
fate, in the research aimed at un- 
derstanding the decomposition of 
water by radiation. This gives in- 
formation on the direct effects of 
radiation on chemical change. Most 
atomic energy is used by degrad- 
ing the radiation energy into heat 
and then using the heat to produce 
chemical or other effects. But the 
short-cut to direct conversion is a 
giant step forward in atomic re- 
search. 

Smaller electronic computers with 
larger “memories” than those in 
present use may be expected in the 
near future. Heart of this new de- 
vice is an information storage tube 
which is an inch-square honey- 
comb gadget that will store up 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 




nearly a million bits of information. 
The honeycomb is a thin sheet of 
glass in which small holes have 
been etched and filled with metal. 
Information written on one side of 
the honeycomb by an electron- 
beam scanning method, similar to 
that used in television, is picked up 
from the opposite side. Holes in the 
device are 500 to the inch, so that 
each square inch has 250,000 indi- 
vidual storage cells — and each cell 
will recognize at least ten different 
levels of intensity from the writing 
gun. 

The ramprop, a jet-driven propeller 
turning at supersonic speeds, could 
give planes that land and take-off 
vertically the speed and load-carry- 
ing capacity of modern aircraft, 
scientists predict. The ramprop 
performs better than the turbojet, 
the turbofan or the turboprop. It 
can also attain high speed in level 
flight. The ramprop propulsion 
system, consisting of rotor blades 
driven with supersonic speeds by 
ramjets or ramrockets at the blade 
tips, are most suitable for heavy 
vertical take-off and landing, be- 
cause large diameter propellers 
present fewer structural limitations. 

Some day cities may be “weather 
conditioned” by plastic pillows 
filled with helium and joined to- 
gether to make a mile-high dome. 
Such a set-up would provide year- 
round sub-tropical weather widiout 
rain or bugs. The sun’s light and 
heat would penetrate (with harm- 
ful rays filtered out) , and rain pour- 
ing off the edges would be caught 
to provide a pure water supply for 

SCIENCE BRIEFS 



all purposes. 

Polarized lenses may soon be stand- 
ard equipment for automobile 
headlights and windshields. Blind- 
ing glares to approaching drivers 
will be eliminatea as well as those 
from approaching cars. In daytime 
driving the polarization will be cut 
with the flick of a switch. 

Chemical firms of the future may 
“employ” microbes as helpers. Re- 
cent laboratory research has shown 
that if lakes in the hot desert could 
be contaminated with the right 
kind of sewage or “broth”, and 
stocked with specially cultivated 
sulphur-producing bacteria, the 
process of building up sulphur de- 
posits could be speeded up to six 
times faster than it takes nature to 
do the job. With such a system in 
full swing, sulphur production 
would no longer be a problem. 

Dehydrofreezing may be a word to 
conjure with in the not too distant 
tomorrow. It’s a name given to a 
new process which combines the 
space saving of dehydration with 
the advantages of freezing. Ordi- 
nary freezing tends to rupture the 
cellular structure of foods. Partial 
dehydration does much to over- 
come the objection, and dehydro- 
frozen foods ret 2 iin the right 
amount of moisture. They can be 
reconstituted by simply soaking 
them in water. Scientists report 
that the process costs somewhat 
more, but lower packaging, freez- 
ing, storage and distribution costs 
should result in an overall saving 
for the consumer.

Dear Sir: 

I read Dr. Riedel’s article in your

lengthy compositive reflection have 
added a few more decimal intervals

— ^Howard Beom 
Chicago, 111. 

Anyone draw any other conclu- 
sions? 

Dear Sir: 

Dr. Riedel makes out a depress- 
ingly good case for Man’s enforced 
isolation due to his inability to ex- 
plore, at this stage of his develop- 
ment, the world outside the solar 
system. I am only a sometime read- 
er of science fiction (although a 
very enthusiastic one) and score 
very low on your I.Q. tests; but if 
we are limited in our eflforts at ex- 
ploration, isn’t it possible that some 

11 



of the intelligent life which Dr. 
Riedel hypothesizes must exist in 
millions of communities throughout 
the universe, has already solved the 
problem of interstellar space flight? 
If this point is conceded, I have 
this suggestion: Why not build an 
automatic broadcasting machine to 
send throughout the galaxy, as far 
as we can make it go, a repetitious 
set of easily understood signals 
which could be immediately rec- 
ognized as originating from living 
intelligence? For example, constant 
repetition of the numbers one, two 
and three. Then leave it up to them 
to locate us. 

If it is argued that this is danger- 
ous, I will answer that it is doubtful 
that any large attack fleet could 
make an interstellar flight, but if 
they could, would they be able to 
survive terrestrial conditions and re- 
main strong enough to fight? And 
why would they necessarily be hos- 
tile? And, dammit, since we only 
have one life to live, wouldn’t it be 
worth it to discover once and for 
all that life does exist in immensi- 
ty? I say, let’s take that chance! 

— Robert Greengard 
New York, New York 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

The argument that Man isn’t 
ready for space because he hasn’t 
perfected a social system on earth 
is idiotic. The two points have no 
correlation, excepting one: a prob- 
lem most easily solved with a max- 
imum of factors known, and if 
space travel brings us a greater 
knowledge of the physical universe 
we’ll be that much closer to com- 
plete knowledge of ourselves. Man 

7 




will reach his full potential when 
he understands best his relation- 
ship to the universe, because some- 
time he’ll meet a race that hasn’t 
the same relationship to the uni- 
verse that we have and we shall 
find ourselves with a problem. 

— ^Donald Dixon 
New Britain, Conn. 

Dear Sirs: 

I didn’t get in at the beginning 
of the argument, but I heartily 
agree with whoever said that the 
human race isn’t ready for space 
travel when as yet it can’t hold 
others as equals and live in peace. 

As far as aliens from space being 
friendly or inmical is concerned, 
both opinions are wrong. What 
makes anyone think that a superior 
race capable of space travel would 
have anything to do with us? Do 
we try to show the baboon his 
shortcomings? He’s a very intelli- 
gent anim^ too, but he hasn’t got 
a thing we want. I believe we’ve 
already been visited by space ships, 
not manned — but recording de- 
vices. I’m going to grab the same 
bobcat by the tail; my name isn’t 
Bellows and I’m not a fatalist. Now, 
anyone want to argue? 

— Robert RafFey 
Minneapolis, Minn. 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

Unlike practically all of your 
correspondents, I am not a scien- 
tist of any sort, nor do I have more 
than a tenth grader’s view of 
science in general. But may I say 
that I do enjoy every story in IF 
as does my father who started me 
on an infamous career of avid 



science-fictionism. I’m not writ- 
ing just to congratulate you all. I 
would also appreciate a little ad- 
vice. What can you suggest as an 
appropriate answer when accused 
of reading science-fiction as an 
escape mechanism? I’m sure more 
than a few readers have the same 
problem, especially those who, too, 
happen to be under someone else’s 
jurisdiction. (Since I don’t know 
anything about science, that can’t 
be used as a proper explanation 
for me.)

North Hollywood, Calif. 

We have memories of having the 
same trouble with our own '^science- 
fictionism*^ way back when. How 
about some help for the gal from 
our readers? 

Dear Mr. Quinn: 

The concept of a “fixed” future, 
just because Mr. Einstein’s theory 
views time as the fourth dimension, 
seems to me to be a very foolish 
one. We fill space (height, width, 
depth) with “things” and until a

FILTHY RICH 

( Continued from page B1 ) 

Suddenly, she turned and pressed 
her face to his chest. The sobbing 
subsided a little and her words 
came haltingly. 



‘Tt was awful. He’s a subversive 
— a criminal — and I didn’t even 
guess.” She caught her breath. “We 
flew over to Staten Island. He 
parked near the water. Then he 
said, T want you to marry me.’ Just 
like that. I liked him a lot — but I 
didn’t know what to say. Then he 
said— Oh Daddy, it was horrible 
— ” Her sobs increased again and 
she fumbled for his pocket kerchief. 
“He — he said, ‘Look at this’. And 
Daddy it was one of those secret

A CASE OF SUNBURN 

( Continued from page 73 ) 

“You’ll get a medal out of it, 
too,” commented Sir Stanrich. 

“Why? Why me?” 

“Because you followed orders, 
even though your mission appeared 
useless. It was your ‘wild goose 
chase’ that made our victory pos- 
sible. 

“You see, only the blue mist of 
Mars protects its surface from the 
hard rays of the sun. Without it, 
we’d have no more protection than 
a naked man in space. The reason 
we’re in for a bad sunburn every 
year is that the blue mist dissipates 
partially at every Earth-sun con- 
junction.” 

“But what would The Egg have 
to do with that?” asked Jonner. 

“The Egg amplifies the effect of 
magnetic fields, the way a lens con-

centrates light rays,” answered Sir 
Stanrich. “It’s the Earth’s magnetic 
field, not that of Mars, that inter- 
feres with the blue mist every time 
the Earth passes between Mars and 
the sun. And to amplify Earth’s 
magnetic field, we had to place 
The Egg directly between Mars 
and Earth during the Earth-sun 
conjunction — and you put it there 
when you got the Egg into an 
Earthward orbit on schedule.” 

“But, Sir Stanrich, I’ve been sun- 
burned a dozen times at these con- 
junctions . .” 

“Not like this. When the blue 
mist was stripped away completely 
this time, everyone on the surface 
was affected. Marscorp’s troops 
were put out of action as an effec- 
tive fighting force when they re- 
ceived severe burns over most of 
their bodies and were afflicted with 
acute conjunctivitis so badly they 
were half blinded. That’s why we 
abandoned Charax and Regina and 
pulled all our people to the Isidis 
jbase — while the conjunction was 
under way, we were all protected 
from the sun . underground!” 

They had reached the center of 
the city. Above the old Syrtis Major 
Hotel, which had served as Mars- 
corp’s supreme headquarters, the 
flag of the Charax Rebels was flut- 
tering in the breeze from the city’s 
air circulators. 

Marscorp was beaten. Mars was 
free. END
