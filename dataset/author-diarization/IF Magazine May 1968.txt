He wasn't human any more. But 
he had been — and he still knew 
how to suffer like a human being! 


by C. C. MacAPP 


Illustrated by JEFF JONES 


I 

A BIT OF rasTORY: To observers in 
the solar system, the Beam ap- 
peared to originate — or terminate 
— in the neighborhood of Sirius. 
Fledgling Earth, already intoxicated 
with her unexpected invention of a 
Faster-Than-Light Drive, greeted the 
Beam’s sudden blossoming across the 
heavens with mixed reactions. To 


many, it was God’s bright beckoning 
sign. What else could it be? It was a 
rainbow, wasn’t it? Even if it wasn’t 
a bow, but a straight slender ribbon 
stretching away to visual infinity. 

The unreligious had their turn 
eleven days later, when the Eje con- 
voy landed on Pluto and broadcasted 
a short greeting in excellent Eng- 
lish and other human languages. 

Mankind, fairly well ensconced

throughout most of the solar system, 
milled, spewed words, mobilized and 
waited. Gradually, t^ee things be- 
came clear: the Eje were making no 
moves to expand, on or off Pluto; 
they weren’t going to communicate 
much, and they weren’t going to dis- 
play themselves at all. A fourth thing 
took longer to realize: the Eje weren’t, 
for the time, offering Mankind any- 
thing except the use of the Beam and 
certain peculiar limited services on 
Pluto — and, later, at the far end of 
the Beam. 

In time, people got used to that 
situation. People went out and used 
the Beam, which was a sort of rapid- 
transit highway (many times as fast 
as FTL) running fifteen thousand 
light-years out tor the next galactic 
spiral arm. They colonized around 
the far end and, to soihe extent, in 
the Sparse Regions along the way. 
They accepted the services of the 
Pluto establishment, which was a sort 
of hospital offering a sort of survival 
to mentally ill or mortally injured 
people who could be gotten to it, or 
near it, in time. 

After ei^ty-odd years, people in 
and out of the solar system took 
the enigmatic aliens more or less for 
granted. Most assumed, by then, that 
the Eje had no wicked designs upon 
mankind. 

Of course, some had doubts. There 
was one man in particular. Or a sort 
of a man .... 

Vohnny SubbI Johnny Subb! 

Get out of here and crawl back 
in your tubr 

— ChMren*s taunt, Earth, 
circa 2060 A. D. 


B eam Tramp was a small, unpre- 
tentious, moderately decrepit 
ship, of a type commonly found 
along the Beam, hauling oddments of 
freight and sometimes a few paying 
passengers. She was basically a squat 
cylinder, forty feet tall and half again 
as much in diameter. The ring around 
her middle that housed the drives and 
field-shapers wasn’t faired off or 
otherwise prettified, so that from a 
distance she looked like a stub of 
iron bar with a single turn of heavy 
square wirq soldered around her — 
plus, here and there, pocks and knobs 
that were external organs. Nothing 
identified her, or hinted that she be- 
longed to the most potent single cor- 
poration between Sol and Far End. 

The hour chron in her Main Con- 
trol Room (aft as she flew, at ground 
level as she sat) read, 1806: 2919. 

Seeing her crew as she settled on 
gravs through the uncontaminated at- 
mosphere of Lenare (an unimpor- 
tant world about a third of the way 
out along the Beam) you wouldn’t 
have known Raise Bukanan or his 
second in command, Leander White, 
from the rest. They were all male 
subbs. Their bodies were as alike as 
if they’d been grown in identical vats 
— which probably they had been, 
though the Eje didn’t say. The blunt, 
immobile faces might have been 
masks. The hairless mediiun-brown 
skins didn’t hold scars long enough 
to serve as identification — nor did 
the toneless labored voices help. Only 
when you’d lived with them a while, 
learned the individual gestures and 
idioms and the slight differences of 
posture, plumpness and such, could 
you have told them apart.

Raise heard the ground-level lock 
rumble open. He left the control room 
and went out to stand in the open- 
ings looking down at the clearing be- 
low and taking deep breaths of the 
clean cool air. It still had the tree- 
smell, a little ^icier than pine. The 
town half-circ^g the packed-dirt 
field hadn’t grown much, and a train 
of pack animals plodding along the 
road inland moved at the same un- 
hurried pace. 

He leaned out to look at the rows 
of one-story, rough-lumber ware- 
houses at the other side of the field. 
The largest bore on its slanting 
shing roof the sign, “Port City. Lea- 
are,” and, in small letters, ‘"Bukanan 
Enterprises Regional Hdqtrs.” The 
sign was freshly painted. Nat Glover 
kept things up. 

Beam Tramp was hovering now, 
shifting a little to pick a spot among 
the twenty-odd parked spacecraft. She 
settled and touched down. Raise 
leaned toward the communicator 
grill. “Lee?” 

“Yes, Raise.” 

“I’m going aground. Fuel and pro- 
vision, will you?” He stepped down 
and walked to the building that bore 
the sign. 

T here were several female subbs 
— dressed as unalike as possible 
— at wort ill tbe office, plus one 
male who sat at a desk adding up 
columns of figures. As he glanced 
up, Raise said, “I’m off Beam 
Tramp, Verbal message for Nat 
Glover.” 

The other glanced at Raise’s boots 
with their swaged tops for sealing to 
spacesuits, at the thin snug-fitting 


white zipperall garment, at the belt 
and empty holster. Satisfied, he bent 
toward a crude-looking intercom box 
and spoke quietly. There was a pause, 
then a barely audible reply. The subb 
at the desk looked up and nodded 
toward a door at the rear. Raise 
walked to it and entered, closing it 
behind him. 

Nat Glover looked up from his 
desk, smiled and wav^ a hand 
toward a chair. “Do I know you?” 

Raise remained standing, eyeing 
his regional manager — and chief 
link to Earth — with what he knew 
would be an annoying stare if he let 
it last too long. Nat hadn’t changed 
much. The lanky frame might be a 
trifle gaunter; the hair a little grayer; 
the tanned face — yes, the face 
was deeper-lined. But the gray eyes 
were as alert and clear as ever. Raise 
waited until the lean face showed a 
touch of impatience. After two years 
with other subbs, he had a kind of 
hunger for human expressions. 

He used one of their private jokes. 
“Nat; don’t you recognize my dis- 
tinctive face?” 

Nat blinked, opened his mouth, 
grinned suddenly, reached out to 
make sure the intercom was off, un- 
tangled his legs from beneath the 
desk, hauled himself to his feet, and 
rushed forward, gnarled hand thrust 
out. “Raise! I wasn’t expecting you 
for a thousand hours at least!” He 
grabbed Raise’s hand, not glancing 
at it as most Normals would. “Raise, 
it’s sure — ” His face went sud- 
denly serious. “Oh, hell. I forgot for 
a moment. I don’t suppose you got 
my message yet.” 

Raise, a sudden tenseness in his

middle, studied Glover’s face. “The 
last I heard from you, my son had 
quit college and insisted on coming 
into space. Out with it, Nat. What’s 
happened?” 

Nat looked down; looked at the 
closed door; met Raise’s eyes again. 
“He came. Raise. Sooner than I ex- 
pected. Paid his own way out some- 
how. And 1 didn’t handle him right.” 

Raise’s pulse quickened with the 
feeling his face and voice couldn’t 
show. “I asked you not to pamper 
him. What happened, Nat? He’s 
not — ?” 

Nat turned, walked to his desk, 
plumped a hand down on it aimless- 
ly and looked at Raise again. “I don’t 
know whether he’s dead or alive. He 
didn’t like it here. 1 let him ride up 
to Itontown with a pack train so he 
could look for work he liked. He 
had his degree in metallurgy; 1 hadn’t 
known that .... He got involved with 
a woman, an indentured girl just out 
from Ea^. He bought her. To get 
money to pay for everything and to 
get married and set up housekeeping, 
he signed on with some space jackal 
who pretended to have a get-rich- 
quick gem-mining opportunity on 
some unnamed planet. And a few 
hours after they’d lifted, I got a ran- 
som demand — addressed to you.” 
Glover sat down slowly. “Damn it. 
Raise, it was all my fault. 1 should 
have made it plainer to Kime that he 
could draw on me for whatever he 
wanted. But he’s an independent 
young scamp. And besides . .” 

Raise watched him a moment. 
“What, besides?” 

“Well — he doesn’t like subbs. One 
of the first things he asked me when 


he got here was why we hired so 
many. And maybe I was a little abrupt 
with him about that.” 

R aise walked to a chair and sat 
down. So, Kime was that way — 
like his dead mother. Not that she 
could have taught it to him — he’d 
have been too young when she died. 
And he couldn’t know that his own 
father had become one. She*d never 
known; nor did anyone else, on, or 
near. Earth, outside confidential 
Government files. Raise had been 
careful about that. Right or wrong, 
he’d been careful. “None of it’s your 
fault, Nat. You handled the trust 
fund, and everything, as thoroughly 
as anybody could. Who’s this space 
rat he signed on with?” 

‘T don’t know him. He’s called 
Pank Sunner.” 

Raise’s inner turmoil grew. “I 
know about Sunner. He works far- 
ther out along the Beam, mostly, 
picking up whatever dishonest dollar 
he can. But he’s no one-ship scaven- 
ger. He’s got ten ships, at least And 
crews of cutthroats to go with them. 
He’s got a good hideout somewhere 
— I haven’t any idea where. You 
can bet he had ransom in mind from 
the start; gem-mining’s too honest for 
him. What leads do you have? Are 
there ships out looking for more?” 
“All 1 can divert. Raise. The only 
lead I had was the girl. She remem- 
bered Sunner’s name.” 

“Who is she? Some slut?” 

“I wouldn’t say so. She was 
stranded when Kime didn’t come 
back, and 1 got her a job here in 
town as a waitress, so she’d be 
around. She seems decent. Maybe

you ought to talk to her. She . 
doesn’t know about you, of course. 
Or about the ransom demand.” Nar 
bent and scribbled on a notepad. 

Raise took the paper and read, 
“Annelle Travis. Earthside Cafe,” 
th^h stuffed it in a pocket. ‘These 
ships aground here. How many are 
ours?” 

“Only two, and they’re loading 
consignments 1 haven’t been able to 
cancel. The rest are independents.” 

•Raise said, “Lease or buy them. 
Of hire them to carry our own com- 
mitments. Pay what you have to. 
rii want you to set up a network 
. but I’d better wait and see what 
r can find out from the girl. Will 
you get busy on those independents?” 
He got to his feet, started toward 
the door, turned. “Nat, what’s he 
like?’'^- 

' Glover, reaching for the telephone, 
paused and half smiled. “Green, of 
cOtirse. Stubborn. A couple inches 
shorter than I am, dark hair, light 
cy^. Not too muscular yet, but a 
gdOd frame and fairly athletic. He 
looks like that old picture of you be- 
fore your — your accident, that you 
shbwed me once.” 

Raise nodded and left.

fit ’ 

S he was slight, brown-haired and 
brown-eyed, with a graceful rather 
thin cutely pretty face that showed 
hief fieielings, but not too much. She 
(hdn^t offer a hand, but she was po- 
Hte.' T don’t think there’s anything 
bdyond what I’ve told Mr. Glover.^’ 

‘ Raise, hating his flat voice, said, 
“If you’ll indulge me. Miss Travis, 


any small detail might help. I’ve 
traveled the Beam a lot more than 
Nat Glover has.” 

She made a resigned gesture. “All 
right. 1 came out from Earth in- 
dentured. My parents . there was 
a traffic accident, and all of a sud- 
den 1 was alone', and there was no 
money, and — well, I had to do 
something. And the advertisements — 
you have no idea how they lie, Mr. — 
I’m sorry. I don’t know your name, 
do I?” 

“Anything addressed to Leander 
White will reach me. Miss Travis.” 

“Mr. White. Well, it wasn’t until 
I was standing on that auction block 
that I realized what ‘indentured’ 
means out here. I was about to cry. 
Then Kime pushed his way out of 
the crowd. His face was like murder. 
I saw that he was sorry for me, and 
he looked — looked civilized, so 
I . really, I guess, I tried to make 
an appeal to him without saying any- 
thing. Anyway, there was an argu- 
ment, and he didn’t have enough 
money to — to buy me. But when 
he told them his name, they ac- 
cepted his credit. 

“He had to rent a room for me on 
credit too. He made me take a little 
cash, all he had, I guess, then he 
went out to find work. And after a 
few days he found the gem-mining 
proposition, and he was all excited. 
He was supposed to be back in less 
than thirty days, and . well, we’d 
be married and have plenty of 
money for a start. The — the thirty 
days went by. I tried to find work, 
but there was nothing that — well, I 
guess you know Irontown. And the 
landlady got nasty. I didn’t even have 

IF

money for food. If Mr. Glover 
hadn’t found me, I’d have — ” Her 
eyes were wild now. 

Raise said, “You thought about 
suicide? You should have come to 
Bukanan Enterprises, Miss Travis.” 
She colored a little. “By then, I 
wasn’t sure about things.” 

He studied her face. “Please tell 
me what you mean.” 

She got redder. “I guess it would 
be cowardly to lie about it. He 
wouldn’t have — have taken advan- 
tage of me, I guess, or at least 1 
didn’t think so then, but 1 was so 
grateful and . alone. And I really 
liked him. I, well, I guess I threw 
myself at him.” 

He was careful not to look at h^ 
too directly. “People aren’t puritanical 
out here, Miss Travis. But what do 
you mean, later you weren’t sure? 
Did he say anything that made you 
think he might be doubtful about 
getting back?” 

“No.” She faced him squarely. “It 
was ju^ day after day went by, and 
I was getting desperate. 1 began to 
wonder if Fd been a fod. Maybe you 
can’t understand that. You’ve never 
been a — ” She caught hraelf. 

After a moment he s»d, “No, I’ve 
never been a woman, but I was a man 
once, Miss Travis, and I can under- 
stand how you felt.” He wondered 
how she’d react if he kfentified him- 
self, told her about hiniself and 
Kime’s mother on Earth — how he’d 
had to hide, or thought he had to 
hide, what happened to him, know- 
ing that his wife would wait, day 
after day, for the message that said 
he was coming home rather than 
that there’d been another delay. 


There must have come a time when 
she, too, wondered if she weren’t a 
castoff. But he’d sent money. Tbere’d 
always been money, whatever that 
meant. 

He tried to think of something re- 
assuring to say to Annelle Travis that 
wouldn’t sound stupid. He could not. 
“Miss Travis, tell me everything he 
said about Pank Sunner.” 

“Actually,” she said, “it was al- 
most nothing, except that they were 
going to a secret gem mine. He 
didn’t even mention Mr. Sunner’s 
name. I came to see him leave, and 
I knew the ship because it was the 
one that had just brou^t me to Len- 
are.” 

Raise went tense. “Did you teU 
Nat Glover that?” 

“Why ... I don’t know. I was 
almost out of my mind when I first 
talked to Mr. Glover.” She looked 
suddeidy startled* “1 didn’t ihink 
Captain Sunner had anything to do 
with my circumstances. The ship 
that brought me, and several othecs, 
out from Earth left the Beam pist 
long enough to transfier us and some 
caigo to Captain Sunner’s ship. I 
thou^ it was just a normal local 
transfer. Wasn’t it? Captain Sunner 
was so courteous.” 

Raise decided not to disillusion her 
about Sunner. “Wasn’t there anything 
else Kime said that made you won- 
der?” 

“No. He was so happy. He seemed 
to think it was a big adventure.” She 
was silent a moment. ’The landlady 
was always talking to me. She said 
she’d seen lots of young men go out 
like that and that very few of them 
would ever come back to a planet

like Lenare. She said he was — ” 
!%e looked embarrassed again. 

Raise said, “ ‘Gone where the 
subbs go?’ Is that what she said?” 

S he met his eyes. ‘‘Yes. I’d heard 
the expression on Earth, of 
course. But I’d never truly resized 
how big space is. To think we can’t 
even see Sol from herel” She hesi- 
tated. “You’re the first — ‘Substi- 
tue Body’ is the origin of the word, 
isn’t it? — I’ve ever really talked 
with. On Earth — ” 

He should have let that pass, 
but he was hungry for Normal faces 
and voices. ‘T know^ Miss Travis. 
Not many subbs stay on Earth. We’re 
more comfortable out here. We can 
stand exposure better than Normals, 
yoii know, and digest things a Nor- 
mal coulc^’t. I hope you don’t be- 
lieve the stories that go around. We 
aren’t slaves of the Eje, Miss Travis, 
an<^ we don’t plot war against the 
rest of mankind. We were all Nor- 
mals once. Our brains weren’t chang- 
ed ^ by the surgical transfer.” He 
stopped, ashamed of his outburst, 
happy for once that his voice and 
face didn’t reveal the feelings inside. 

^he smiled throu^ her embarrass- 
ment. “I never believed the stories. 
\Veire you in the solar system when 
yoii had your . accident?” 

‘ “!No, Miss Travis, I was out near 
l^ar tnd. The Eje have another hos- 
pital there, like the one on Pluto.” 
He w^ anxious to leave the subject 
now. 

But she wasn’t. “You can’t imagine 
how mysterious it dHH seems to people 
whpVe never been off Earth. For- 
^ve me, but there’s one question I 


have to ask. Are you really immor- 
tal?” 

He sighed. “No, Miss Travis, I’m 
sure we’re not. That’s the thing that 
seems to worry Normals the most. 
Our bodies do regenerate themselves 
very well.” He held out his left 
hand, palm down. ‘That thumb was 
manned badly not long ago. You 
can’t even find a scar now. But the 
oldest subbs say they feel they’re 
aging. The oldest I’ve ever met — he 
was a surgeon in the hospital, out at 
Far End — is a little over eighty, I 
mean since his brain transplant. He 
definitely looks older. My own guess 
is we might live two hundred years. 
But not forever. And a bad accident 
kills us, like anyone else.” He hur- 
ried to change the subject. “Miss 
Travis, what was the name of the 
ship that brought you out from 
Earth?” 

“Why, it was called Cetus'" 

He felt eager to get back to Nat 
Glover now. “Is there anything else 
you can tell me?” 

“I . don’t remember anything. 
Bpt do you mind if I ask you one 
more thing? Not about — ” 

“Go ahead, Miss Travis.” 

“What’s Kime’s father like? I’d 
heard of him, even on Earth. He’s 
supposed to be very rich and power- 
ful and very mysterious. Kime’s 
never seen him, you know, and he 
doesn’t . .” 

After a moment he prompted 
slowly, “He doesn’t approve of his 
father, you mean.” 

“Well — Kime’s mother was de- 
serted, it seems, and the letters weren’t 
very — very personal. Cold and 
disinterested, Kime said. And there 


14 


IF 



' was the matter of allowing people 
to be bought and sold, here on Len- 
are.” 

R aise said, “Miss Travis, Bukanan 
Enterprises only owns a fraction 
of Lenare, not including Irontown. 
As on many Freehold worlds, there’s 
no planet-wide law. Most of the 
owners here have reasons to keep 
Lenare backward. Kime’s father 
spends most of his time farther out 
on the Beam; that’s probably why he 
seems mysterious. As you said, space 
is big. Miss Travis, can you tell me 
where you transferred from Cetus to 
Pank Sunner’s ship? Opposite here?” 
“Why, no. We had to go back into 
the Beam again, to get opposite 
here.” 

He stared at her. “How far — 
how long was it, from the transfer 
Until you left the Beam opposite Len- 
are? Did you keep track?” 

“Yes, I did. About sixty hours.” 
“And was the transfer between 
here and Sol? Or farther out?” 

“Why ... I don’t know. I assumed 
it was nearer Sol.” 

He asked, his slow voice a little 
shaky, “Do you know how long the 
trip was, from the time you entered 
the Beam near Sol, to the transfer? 
Did Cetus leave the Beam anywhere 
else?” 

She glanced at his hands, which, 
he realized, were clenched. “No. We 
were in the .Beam for over four 
hundred hours, then left it, and Cap- 
tain Sunner’s ship was waiting. Is it 
important?” 

“It might be,” he said. “I appreci- 
ate your talking to me. Miss Travis. 
Vd better let you go now** 


She put . out a hand to restrain 
him, drew it back a little too fast 
“Mr. White — ah these questUnis* 
Have they something to do with 
Kime? Do you think he’s in trouble?’* 
Glad again of his face and voice, 
he lied, ^Tm just trying to get a hint 
of where Pank Sunner’s gem mine 
mig^t be. There are any number of 
things that may have delayed thm. 

I wouldn’t be surpri^. Miss Tra- 
vis, if he showed up tomorrow, with 
a trunk full of rubies.” 

Ill 

N at Glover put down the telephone 
and looked up as Raise came 
in. “Learn anything?” 

“Yes. I learned that Kime knows 
a good woman when he sees one. 1 
also learned that Sunner has been 
dealing with a ^p called Cetus!* 
Glover frowned over that. **Cetus? 

I thought she was legitimate. We*ve 
had freight for her, and from her, 
but Fve never seen her.” 

Raise said, ‘1 knew she wasn’t 
strictly legit. She makes the run dear 
to Far End, dropping out of the 
Beam along the way to meet local 
shipping, but seldom makes planet- 
fall. She’s an old ship, originaBy huBt 
just for the passenger run, wh^ that 
was expected to be a paying propo- 
sition. Later, she was rebuilt to carry 
mostly freight, with only a hundred 
or so passengers. She’s cautious. But 
she hauls ‘Indentures,’ among other , 
things.” 

Glover blinked and sat up straight- 
en “And ^e brought the girl out hrom > 
Earth? Raise, I’m slipping! I should 
have learned that!” 


WHERE THE SUBBS GO

Raise said, “You didn’t know 
Sunner or his habits. What we*ve got 
to do now is find Cetus. If we can 
find out where she meets Sunner — 
then’ll be more fhw one place — 
we might get a hint of where his 
hideout is. We’ll hardly be lucky 
enough to stumble ri^t onto it, but 
if we can build up a picture of Sun- 
nefs movements and make a statisti- 
cal analysis — 

He walked to a large wall-chart, 
showing, one above another, sections 
of the Beam; tapped a brown fore- 
finger on one line. **Cetus met Sunner 
sixty hours out from us. Then he 
made the run back here to peddle 
thei Indentures he’d bought It must 
have been pure luck, his running in- 
to Kime.” He stood thinking. “He’s 
stayed clear of us, up until now, 
and he’s no fool. He must want cash 
badly.” 

Glover said, “He’s after a lot. Ten 
thousand millicreds.” 

Raise grunted. “Plenty! Still, he 
must know careful he’ll have to be, 
with us. How does he propose collect- 
ing?” 

‘♦He’ll specify that later. I’m to get 
Ae word to you and gather negoti- 
able metal here.” 

Raise turned to the chart. “Sixty 
hours . seven or eight hundred 
Kght^years . .” 

Glover squinted at the chart. 
*^Cttus will be halfway to Far End 
by how.” 

“No,” Raise said. “She usually has 
cargo and passengers for Antietam 
Station.” 

Glover frowned. “Wouldn’t she 
stop there first? Oh! I see! She’d un- 
load anything illicit — like Inden- 


tures — then turn around and go 
back to the Station. Sixty hours . 
plus a hundred twenty from here 
back in ... we might not be too far 
behind, if she did that. I’ve chartered 
fourteen of these ships that are here, 
and two more are coming from Iron- 
town. Shall I start them out along 
the Beam, making inquiries?” 

“No. Cetus is only one lead. I want 
you to concentrate on the stretch 
from here back to Antietam Station, 
and for only a hundred hours out 
toward Far End. I’ll be going out to 
the Drowned Cluster, and I’ll put a 
whole fleet out along the rest of the 
Beam. Keep picket ships at our own 
stops along the Beam, so I can get 
word without running clear back 
here.” 

Glover said unhappily, “With you 
clear out there — ” 

Raise turned to face him. ‘This 
search will cost more Aan you can 
muster at this end. Then there’s the 
ransom. We’ll have to be ready to 
pay that. Right? So you’ll need coin 
metal.” 

“Well, yes. A lot.” 

“And,” Raise said, “there’s no 
place I can get it in a hurry except 
at the Cluster. I’ll run out there — 
with one stop — get a fleet started 
searching, and bring back metal. Prob- 
ably rhodium.” 

Glover sighed and nodded. 
“You’re right. What’s the one stop 
you’ll make? Or is it any of my 
business?” 

“New Eden. It’s not far from 
where Sunner must have met Cetus** 
Glover said slowly, “Ernesto Vas- 
quez is no slave trader.” 

“No. But he’s not entirely legit, 

IF

either, and I happen to know that 
he’s dealt with Sunner. He and 1 
have done business more than once, 
and he’s obligated to me. Also, he 
knows 1 could upset his applecart.” 
Raise paused. ‘We’ve got a certain 
amount of time, while Sunner thinks 
you’re still trying to get messages to 
me. Don’t let anyone know I’ve been 
here. Sunner doesn’t know much 
about me, and 1 want to keep it that 
way. He doesn’t know I’m a subb, of 
course.” Raise turned to^gard the 
door. “I’ll see you, Nat.” 

earn Tramp's hour chron showed 
:2924. 

The intercom chimed, announcing 
that they were out of Lenare’s atmos- 
phere and accelerating to the high 
velocity that would let them shift 
into FTL. Raise, alone in Main 
Control, glanced at the figures scroll- 
ing across a computer screen. Lean- 
der White was handling the program- 
ming with his usual precision, from 
Aux Control in the other end of the 
ship, where he had banks of special 
instruments he’d tinkered up. 

Raise reached out and activated a 
forward telescreen. An image of the 
Beam leaped to life. He sat staring 
at the rainbow slash. From Lenare’s 
distance — eight light-years, nearly 
a hundred hours’ travel by FTL — 
it was an easily seen ribbon, even 
without magnification. Men knew, 
now, that the “rainbow” was only a 
side-effect, c^ed by a comparative- 
ly tiny spill of energy. (What kind of 
energy, they didn't know) . Somehow 
charged particles were whirled helical- 
ly around the Beam, spiralling bil- 
lions of miles out, while something 


like a Doppler effect made one side 
look red and the other blue. 

He glanced at a radar screen where 
a blip had been showing for a few 
minutes. That would be one of Nafs 
newly acquired ships starting out. Al- 
ready the blip was fuzzy, as Tramp's 
velocity climbed. 

He stood up and began to pace 
the control room. The long hours 
from any planet to the Beam were 
always tedious, but he hadn’t fell 
this angry, rebellious discontent for 
a long time — not since that h^- 
sane period when he’d first been a 
subb. Was it just a father’s concern 
for a son he’d never seen? He hadn’t 
thought much about Kime, though 
the years. There’d been so many 
things out here — building the Cor- 
poration, directing the blind probes 
into the forbidding dust cloud that 
hid the Drowned Cluster, setting up 
the furtive research projects that even 
Nat Glover didn’t know about, the 
clandestine task — as wary of the 
Eje as of a baselessly suspicious 
Earth — of recruiting the right kind 
of subbs. “Where the subbs go.” 
Bukanan Enterprises, especially in the 
Cluster, was where a lot of them 
went. 

e half heard the intercom chime, 
warning of the leap into FTL. 
He braced himself by habit against 
the brief lurch as a different kind of 
artificial gravity took over and 
stepped to the console to turn off all 
external viewers. You saw nothing in 
FTL. 

No, there was more bothering hkn 
now than worry about Kime. This 
new thing had been with him ever 




WHERE THE SUBBS GO 


17 



since he talked to Aonelle Travis. 
Partly, he supposed, it was a re- 
stirring of his guilt about his own 
dead wife. But there was more. Meet- 
ing her, hearing her talk about his 
son, brought it really home to him 
for the first time that Kime was a 
grown man now. And that made a 
father feel old, 

A short harsh sound — the subb 
travesty of a laugh — came unex- 
pectedly from him. Hell, he thought, 
subbs don't worry about aging. Any 
Normal will tell you that. 

Only it wasn’t true. Many subbs 
thought intensely, desperately, about 
eventual death. 

He remembered reading somewhere 
once, when he was too young to un- 
derstand it, that having a son was the 
only way a man could achieve a 
kind of immortality. That, he’d re- 
alized now for a long time, was why 
so many subbs threw themselves 
fiercely into his Bio projects that 
were trying to give subbs fertility. 
Subbs weren’t fertile. So, unless a 
subb already had children he’d never 
have any. And so, if they weren’t 
scientists or technicians, ^ey’d do 
an3Tthing to help — work in mines, 
grow food, carry hods to build new 
laboratories. 

It came to Raise now, in a sort of 
unastonished surprise, ^t his own 
lack of fanaticism toward the Bio 
projects (even though he’d built them 
was quite simply explained by his 
already having a son. 

And now that son was in serious 
danger, if not alreMy dead. 

JWell, there was no way to hurry 
Tramp along. He snapped and ate and 
paced and toured the ship, as he al- 


ways did, and repeated the dreary 
cle. 

► 

D ead reckoning said ^ they were 
nearing the Beam. Raise sat at 
the console and punched two studs. 
The figures vanished from Main- 
comp’s screen and were replaced by 
a mock-up representation of Tramp's 
position. A small green arrow crawl- 
ed, at a forty-five degree angle, 
toward the nearer of two parallel 
lines. Fgfty-five degrees wasn’t quite 
the optimum for entering the Beam 
with maximum speed along it, but 
it was a lot easier to compute exact- 
ly. And when travelling in the Beam, 
you didn’t want to overshoot or un- 
dershoot your emergence point. 

Another chime sounded. He wait- 
ed, braced in his seat. The arrow sud- 
denly stopped and turned blue. Tramp 
was now out of FTL — which you 
had to be to enter the Beam. Radar 
screens and televiewers came to life. 
There were no radar blips. The view- 
ers showed the Beam itself. 

They were far inside the rainbow 
now, of course. The images on the 
viewers were of spiralling, luminous 
lines of force. Because of Tramp's 
motion, they seemed to turn like a 
barber-pole, even while expanding. 
The shifting perspective was confus- 
ing, as always; Raise didn’t try to 
follow it. A secondary computer was 
recording it and analyzing it, anyway. 

That was Raise’s real bent — try- 
ing to study the Eje technology. It 
was a frustrating pursuit. 

The gaps between the bright bands 
of force seemed very wide now. There 
was a dizzying shift as the unknown 
forces seiz^ Tramp. They gulped her 


18 


IF 



in and realign^ her; and then they 
were inside. 

There were no spiral bands now. 
If they existed from the viewpoint, 
they were telescoped together so 
tightly they became one solid lumi- 
nous tube. He left the external view- 
ers on. Sometimes there were things 
to see — the Mostly after-image of 
a Terran ship recently passed this 
way, or, very rarely, of an oval Eje 
ship. Several times, in his years of 
travelling the Beam, Raise had seen 
aberrations in the Wall — gaping 
holes or irregular flickers, with tan- 
gled threads of force whipping about. 
You couldn’t see, or photograph, any- 
thing through those holes. The stars 
outside the Beam might as well be in 
another universe. 

They probably were, 

Still, Tramp was packed with in- 
struments, some of which would have 
puzzled Earth scientists. He’d never 
given up hoping the Eje would slip 
some time, and he’d learn something 
about them. 

He got up to pace again. He’d en- 
dured the hundred hours from Lenare 
to the Beam. Now he’d have to en- 
dure the sixty hours along the Beam 
and the more-than-one-hundred hours 
from the Beam to New Eden. 

IV 

N ew Eden must have been named 
by someone fresh out from Luna 
of Mars. Rusty sand drifted across 
three-fourths the surface. Mountain 
ranges were old and worn down, the 
seas shrunken and resigned. Most of 
the rivers were dry except during 
rains, and even then all but a few

hastily lost themselves in deserts, as 
if burrowing to escape the swollen 
red sun. Neverthdess there were polar 
ice caps, and, around them, temperate 
zones with a few live rivers and 
lakes. The only spaceport and the 
only town of any size were beside 
one of the lakes. As Tramp descend- 
ed, Raise saw only two rusty hulls 
parked on the field. Both of those 
belonged to the planet’s proprietor. 

Vasquez, blocky, with a broad face 
almost as brown as Raise’s, and with 
short-cropped erect white hair above 
still-black eyebrows, leaned in the 
doorway of a low spreading adobe 
building and watched Raise approach. 
He spoke softly. “That is a Bukanan 
ship, no?” 

“You know she is, Ernesto.” 

The tanned face split in a grin, 
showing perfect white teeth. “Ralsel 
Often I envy you your disguise.” 
Raise glanc^ around. “I’d rather 
have it unpenetrated, this trip. I can 
use a few provisions, and informa- 
tion. I’ll pay well for both.” 

Vasquez turned and called into the 
building, “LuisI” A slender dark boy 
of perhaps twelve, barefooted and 
nearly nude, appeared from the dark 
interior. He glanced at Raise, then 
at Beam Tramp, His father told him, 
‘Tell your mother we are not to be 
disturbed. Then go to the ship and see 
what they require.” 

Vasquez led the way into the 
building and to a shady central patio 
lined with flowers, into which win- 
dows looked from three sides. Vas- 
quez placed chairs against the win- 
dowless side, “How may I help you, 
friend Raise?” 

Raise said, “You sometimes do 


19 



busmess with a man named Pank 
Sunner.” 

Vasquez blinked once. “Since you 
know it, I will not bother to deny. 
Do you have a grudge with him?” 
“A possibly deadly one.” 

Vasquez sighed and stared at a bed 
of yellow flowers. “He has brought 
me profit, at times. But you have 
brought me more. And I do not un- 
derestimate the power of Bukanan 
Enterprises. So . • Sunner was here 
twenty days ago. Our days. They are 
long, you know.” 

Raise calculated. Plenty of time for 
Sunner to have reached the Beam, 
made a short run to rendezvous with 
Ceti4S, and gotten to Lenare with his 
Indentures. 

Vasquez was watching him. “Per- 
haps, Raise, you will trade me in- 
formation. You travel much and have 
many eyes and ears. Someone else 
was here, asking about Sunner.” 
Raise waited a moment, then ask- 
ed, “The Patrol?” 

“No, Raise. I have not seen the 
Solcon Patrol in a long time. These 
were others. Peculiar-looking men — 
two brothers, I think. I did not see 
the rest of the crew. But what has 
me worried is that I knew the ship. 
It was not unlike this one of yours 
— and it used to belong to Pank 
Sunner.” He watched Raise for a mo- 
ment. “Can you tell me what is go- 
ing on?” 

Raise asked, “What did the men 
look like?” 

“Light of skin, with pale gray eyes. 
They had very little hair, and it was 
white as paper. Broad of shoulder, 
but thin from front to back. Shorter 
than you or I. English very good, but 


not quite as you or I would speak h.” 
R^se went taut. After a moment 
he realized he was holding his breath, 
let it out. “Ernesto — did they make 
you think of subbs?” 

Vasquez’s eyes widened for an in- 
stant. ‘They did not at the time. But 
now — forgive me — there was a 
certain lack of expression — ” 
Raise was on his feet. “Ernesto! 
I’ve never seen such subbs — but 
I’ve talked to someone who has. 
Those were subbs. But the brains in 
their skulls were not human. They 
are Eje, Ernesto. Or something that 
serves the Eje!” 

V asquez stared for a moment. 

Then, slowly, he got to his feet, 
pulled a large bandana from a pock- 
et and wiped his hands on it. Thought 
raced behind his brown eyes. 

Raise said, even more hoarsely 
than usual, “What did you tell them? 
When were they here?” 

“I told them I had not seen Sun- 
ner for a long time. It was four days 
after he was here. Now I wish .... 
Raise, I have more than profit to 
think about now. If I am frank with 
you, will you be frank with me? I 
am beyond my depth.” 

Raise said, T will.” 

Vasquez led the way indoors and 
around a comer into the windowless 
wing of the building. Padlocked doors 
lined a corridor. Vasquez stopped at 
one, pulled a ring of keys from 
beneath his loose white blouse and 
unlocked the padlock. 

The storeroom looked common- 
place. Vasquez took an electric lamp 
from a hook on the wall, turned it 
on and rehung it. Then he locked the 


20 


IF 



tloor behind them. He began shifting 
bales of what seemed to be some 
local fiber bundled in burlap. Raise 
helped him. 

When the stack of bales was 
moved. Vasquez pulled aside a reed 
floormat, exposing a dirt floor. He 
took a l^ge jackknife from his pock- 
et and began digging at one spot. He 
uncovered a puU-ring» then began 
feeling with the knifeblade for the 
outline of a trapdoor. 

Raise helped pull the trapdoor 
open. The lamp, when Vasquez 
brought it to the opening, showed a 
steep flight of stairs into a subcellar. 
Raise followed him down. 

There was an assortment of goods; 
cased electronic gear doubtless looted 
from some cargo ship, small bombs 
and missiles of Solcon Patrol models, 
packets of what seemed to be blank 
official documents ready for forgery, 
smaller packages that were probably 
illicit drugs and various other things 
Raise couldn’t identify. 

Stacked in one comer were six long 
cases that might hold trombones or 
rifles. The trader got the top one, 
laid it on a crate, and began working 
with thick fingers at buckles and 
clasps. 

l^e thing inside looked like a bulky 
rifle. Raise accepted it from Vasquez, 
looked it over and hefted it. Too 
heavy to use on a planet. He turned 
it over in his hands, examining it. 
The bore was quite small, with no 
rifling. The sight, was a simple teles- 
copic one, attached with two machine 
screws atop the massive chamber- 
block. There was a place under the 
latter to insert a magazine or clip. 
Raise pushed at the cover, which 


gave but did not open. A wooden 
grip for the left hand extended under 
the barrel, half its length. 

He lifted the stock to his shoulder. 
The balance — assuming low or no 
gravity — was tolerable. But there 
was something that felt a little odd; 
some indefinable difficulty in aiming 
the thing. 

V asquez said, “Sunner told me 
they were a new secret model 
the Patrol will have soon. Very 
powerful. He needed cash for pro- 
visions and fuel, but would not sell 
these weapons. I lent him more 
money on them than I really 
thought they might be worth. But 
now . .” 

Raise began looking the thing over 
more closely. He found screw-heads 
in strange places — under the tip of 
the barrel; along the edges of th6 
block; wherever parts were joined. 
The tenseness in his middle grew. 
“Do you have a screwdriver?” 
Vasquez got out the jackknife 
again. “This will do?” He unfolded 
a screwdriver blade. 

“I think so.” Raise began removing 
screws. 

A thin lining came out of the bar- 
rel. The outer barrel simply screwed 
out of the block. The stock came 
off; the block separated into halves. 
Raise let the false covering drop to 
the dirt floor, piece by piece. In min- 
utes he stood holding an alien weapon 
in shaky hands. He was aware of his 
host’s heavy breathing. 

The thing was so flimsy-looking 
it wouldn’t even make a convincing 
toy — not with Terran construction 
materials. The “barrel” was a pencil- 


V/HERE THE SUBBS GO 


21 



thin cagework of spiraling threads, 
about fifteen inches long. Metal? 
Plastic? No. This wouldn’t bend to 
the touch! He pressed harder. The 
hairlike strands were as rigid as 
girders! 

At the tip, under the “muzzle,” 
was a small tab — just big enough to 
grasp with left thumb and forefinger, 
with guards to prevent touching the 
barrel itself. The grip at the butt end 
was set at a slight angle, like that of 
an automatic pistol. It was no more 
than two and half inches wide, flat 
'and thin except for a half-round ridge 
that ran from its base partway up the 
left side of it. Gingerly, Raise closed 
his hand around it. His thumb rested 
naturally on a stud at the angled top 
of the ridge. He turned the bottom 
up. Something like a large machine 
screw, with a single slot in its head, 
screwed up into the grip. That would 
be the energy-unit. Considering the 
power the Eje must put into the 
Beam, this weapon might equal a 
nuclear bomb. 

He saw no trigger except the stud, 
until he discovered that a welt along 
the tipper half of the forward edge 
of the grip was hinged and could 
be swung down and held against the 
lower part by his second, third and 
fourth fingers. That left the trigger 
— a ne^ly flush bar — easily under 
his forefinger. 

e looked up at Vasquez. “This 
stud under my thumb, 1 think, 
will be a safety or a selector of some 
kind.” He let go carefully of the 
grip and held the thing out to Vas- 
quez. “Notice the inertia, though the 
weight’s almost nothing. You can’t 


jerk this weapon easily. That would 
make for a steady aim. It’s not metal* 
Nor any kind of matter 1 know.” 
Looking distressed, Vasquez han- 
dled the thing gingerly. “What does it 
do, Raise Bukanan?” 

“I have no idea. But my guess is, 
it would make a laser beam look 
like a flashlight by comparison.” 
Raise was shaky with eagerness. He 
wanted this weapon. So many long 
frustrated years, without learning one 
smidgin of Eje technology .... 
“I’m not inclined to try it here, or 
anywhere else I can’t run fast. They 
may have some way of detecting it, 
if it’s fired. Maybe that’s how they 
captured one of Sunneris ships!” 
Vasquez grinned nervously. “So. 
To possess these things is a great 
danger, eh? Already the Eje know 
Sunner had them, and they look for 
him. If they find him, they’ll learn 
where he left them. They may be 
very angry that I lied. Yet there 
is great fortune here. Earth would 
pay much, no?” 

Raise said hoarsely, “/ will pay 
much. If the Eje come back, you 
can tell them Sunner pawned six 
Patrol rifles with you and didn’t 
come back, and you sold them to 
some tramp freighter.” 

Vasquez laid the weapon down 
carefully and wiped his hands a^dn 
with the bandana. He stooped to pick 
up a piece of the disguise. “Sunner 
did this to hide them, eh? I wonder 
how he got them. And what if he 
returns? Perhaps neither you nor the 
Eje will catch him.” 

Raise said, “Give him extra money 
and tell him some story — that the 
Eje came and demanded the things.” 

IF 



22 



Vasquez grinned. “You are eager to 
possess them. It becomes, then, a 
matter of bargaining, eh? There is 
danger for me in any case. Danger 
for you also, but you are better able 
to hide.” 

Raise demanded, “How much?” 
“A hundred millicreds.” 

Raise hardly hesitated. “I can give 
you a fourth that right now, in Sol- 
con currency. 1*11 have to give you a 
note for the rest. All right?” 

“A note,” Vasquez asked softly, 
“which, by the time I try to collect 
it, may bear the signature of a dead 
man?” 

Raise picked up the weapon, im- 
patiently began putting its disguise 
back on. “Every subb with business 
interests has a secret coding, register- 
ed with Solcon. Whether I’m alive 
or not, my note, with the coding 
electronically implanted, can be cash- 
ed on Earth. Or, for that matter, at 
Antietam Station. I keep an emer- 
gency fund there.” 

Vasquez smiled. “I would be a fool 
not to accept. I mi^t sell for ten 
times as much on Earth, eh? But I 
am not on Earth. And 1 would not 
dare, now, to go there suddenly.” 

V 

T Wampy safely in FTL^ flashed 
toward the Beam. Lee White and 
Raise sat in the control room with 
one of the weapons on the console 
bench before them. The parts of the 
disguise lay around it. 

Lee said, “1 guess he made it so 
bulky to cover up the inertia. But it 
wouldn’t fool anybody who really 
knew rifles and looked at it close.” 


“Well,” Raise said, “you’re the 
tinkerer of this crew. Can you shave 
it down and make it more convincing? 
All I want it to do is look right, on 
a rack in the ship’s arsenal. I don’t 
expect anyone to be waving it 
around.” 

“I can sure do that. Raise. I’ll 
have it all convincing, with nicks and 
a little corrosion and everything, by 
the time we get to the Cluster. AU 
six of them.” He began gathering 
up the parts. “I don’t guess we might 
drop out of the Beam somewhere 
along the line and test-fire one?” 
‘^Don’t think,” Raise said, “that I’m 
not as itchy as you are. But before 
we risk getting caught by the Eje, I 
want three or four of these things 
safe in the Cloud. Or however safe 
they’ll be, even there. We’ll test-fire 
one on the way back.” 

Lee left, carrying the weapon care- 
fully. Raise got up and began pacing 
the control room. This was going 
to be a long trip — over a hundred 
hours to the Beam, three hundred 
hours out it to a point over nine 
thousand light-years from Sol, then 
the ticklish hop to Bodega, in the 
Cloud. He wondered if he could stand 
it. 

Somehow, he did. 

T he Beam lay far enough behind 
so the spiral bands weren’t visible 
at zero magnification. Tramp drifted 
as nearly motionless as her sensors 
and computers could arrange, while 
Maincomp chittered away at the job 
of determining her exact position 
Raise followed the figures dancing 
across the screen. A few billion 
miles error would mean death. 


WHERE THE SUBBS GO 


23 




He glanced at the chron, calcu* 
lated idly in his head. On Earthy it 
would be late in November of 2061. 
Lenare’s northern hemisphere would 
still be in early spring; New Eden’s 
long autumn (which ^pped both 
hemispheres at the same time) would 
be wearing on. He wondered if Kime 
were alive on some planet and what 
the season might be. 

He pulled his mind away from 
that and stared at the view-screen 
showing the Cloud. He knew those 
convolutions, those luminosities and 
umbras, as well as he knew Main- 
comp’s keyboard. He picked out the 
particular blackness that hid Bodega’s 
modest sun. More than once, he’d 
regretted choosing that particular star 
for his headquarters — it was too 
hard to reach directly from the Beam.. 
But that, of course, was part of its 
security. No one without very exact 
co-ordinates could FTL to a star in 
a dense dust cloud like this. Unless 
you hit the rarefaction around the 
star, you’d vaporize from friction be- 
fore you could decelerate from drop- 
out speed. With more time, he’d have 
hopped closer first, now, to one of 
the other hidden worlds, where pre- 
cise triangulation was maintained al- 
most to the minute. But he didn’t 
have more time. He activated Comp 
Two and began feeding in data from 
various external sensors and from his 
‘ memory. Figures piled up. 

Presently he reached for an inter- 
com switch. “Lee. I check Maincomp 
within a billion and a half miles. 
I’m taking us in.” 

“Sure, Raise.” 

Raise punched studs. A vernier 
needle on a velocimeter dial began 


• . • 


IF 



to crawl around. He watched it idly 
for a few minutes. Some day» he 
thought, he’d push his luck too far. 
Meanwhile, a man did what he felt 
he must. 

He got to his feet and paced. 
How had Sunner gotten the Eje weap- 
ons? There was no way of guessing. 
But the shrewd pirate must have 
jumped on a moment’s opportunity, 
as he had with Kime. How did those 
two things fit together? 

If Raise had it figured right, the 
weapons must have fallen into Sun- 
ner’s hands many hundreds of hours 
ago. He’d tested one, of course. Care- 
fully. But not carefully enough to 
avoid losing at least one ship to the 
Eje, who must have appeared on 
the spot very quickly. Sunner him- 
self had gotten away, but he’d been 
scared. The Eje simply crewed the 
captured ship and used it in a search, 
hoping a common-type freighter 
wouldd’t scare people off. They must 
have squeezed the tip about New 
Eden out of a captured crewman 
who; obviously, didn’t know any more 
than that Sunner sometimes landed 
there. 

And Sunner, being scared with the 
weapons in his possession — and 
needing funds badly — had gam- 
bled on Vasquez’s honor and gullibili- 
ty. Raise had been lucky enough to 
upset that gamble. 

He turned and stared at screens. 
Ti-atnp hadn’t moved far enough yet 
to make the Cloud look any differ- 
ent. 

It would be worth a lot to know 
what Sunner had learned about the 
weapons and about the Eje. Enough 
to scare him, obviously, and he didn’t 

WHERE THE SUBBS GO 


scare easily. Well, Raise would prob- 
ably have to learn it first-hand. 

Sunner, with whatever scant funds 
he’d gotten from Vasquez, must have 
hurried to keep his rendezvous with 
Cetus, paid for the Indentures (in- 
cluding Annelle Travis) and taken 
them to Lenare. He’d have turned a 
little profit there, but not much. So 
Kime had been a real windfall for 
him. 

And now he wanted a thousand 
millicreds. A lot of money. With it 
he could replace his lost ^p or ships 
many times over pay his crews of 
cutthroats for a long time, buy a new 
hideout planet if he had to. Or lose 
himself on Earth or on one of the 
settled worlds out at Far End. 

What did Sunner fiope to do with 
the weapons? Given time and money 
to work with, he could undoubtedly 
contact the right buyers on Earth. 
Officially, the Solar Confederation 
had no project trying to study Eje 
technology. But Raise was sure the 
nucleus of such a project existed 
somewhere. In any case, there were 
corporations that would pay fabu- 
lously just for one of those Eje power 
units, even without the weapons. 

Or — Sunner might plan to keep 
the things and study-- them himself. 
He had guts enough, and imagina- 
tion enough, for that. A thousand 
millicreds would build labs and pay 
scientists. 

Raise stared moodily at the hour 
chron. Time enough had passed, since 
he’d left New Eden, for a lot of 
things to happen. Sunner might al- 
ready have returned there and learn 
ed that the weapons were gone. The 
Eje might have caught Sunner. In 

25 



that case — or if they’d returned to 
New Eden and sweated Vasquez — 
they’d be on the right track. Even- 
tually, they’d probably know Raise 
had the weapons. 

He began to pace again, fists 
shoved deep in his pod^ets. Never 
had Beam Tramp felt so like a prison. 

D ropout was very near. A chime 
began repeating on the intercom. 
Raise, eyes on di^ felt for seat- 
straps and pulled them around him. 
A crewman came to buckle into an- 
other seat (no one was supposed to 
be alone during Emergency Quarters). 
Outside in the corridor. Raise could 
hear others hurrying to their posts. A 
dial showed the countdown. Seven 
minutes ... six ... 

He wondered how swift death 
would be, if they missed the globe of 
relatively clear space around Bodega’s 
sun. Certainly, not too swift to recog- 
nize. Alarms would scream; the ship 
would lurch. There’d be time to fight 
free of the seat and run aimlessly or 
crouch in terror, waiting for the 
blaze of heat as the hull forward 
vaporized. 

The needle came straight up. Raise 
was aware that the crewman was 
staring at it as fixedly as he was. A 
chime sounded. The instant of disori- 
entation came. His heart thumped; 
his hands gripped the seat until they 
hurt. 

On a viewscreen, a bright diffuse 
glow appeared. He went limp, let 
out his breath, turned to meet the 
crewman’s blank subb stare and made 
a thumbs-up gesture. Then he reach- 
ed for the intercom to tell the whole 
crew, ‘We’re okay; the star’s in sight. 


We’re a little short and to one side, 
so we^ get some heating, but the 
coolers can handle it. Lee. Will you 
program us in?” 

“Sure, Raise. And real glad to be 
doing it.” 

Now there was the wait as the 
glow bri^tened and became more 
compact and, finally, as Tramp 
emerged from the thinning dust, b^ 
came the intense tiny disk of a star. 
It wasn’t a large star, nor a particular- 
ly bright one — but it had enough 
gravity and radiation to clear a space 
around itself. 

In half an hour the planets were 
visible. By that time, Tramp*s veloci- 
ty was down to a small fraction of C. 

Raise got on the radio. “Bodega. 
This is Beam Tramp. We’ll be down 
in a few hours. Is Ted Merk on 
duty?” 

He sat waiting for the reply. Min- 
utes passed — too many minutes. He 
raised his eyes to a bank of dials 
and reached for the intercom. “Lee? 
I’m not getting anything in here. Are 
you?” 

“No, Raise. No radio, no radar 
scan on us. In fact — ” Lee White 
paused, and Raise could hear him 
speaking aside to someone else in Aux 
Control. Then, “Raise, there’s not 
one blip on a screen! And nothing 
on any wavelength! Something’s 
wrong, sure as Satan. Shall I hold 
up?” 

Raise hesitated, skin prickly. “No. 
Go on in. Are you sure our gear is 
working? No heat damage?” 

“It’s all working. Raise. I get 
bounces from the planets.” 

Bodega swelled in the viewers. 
Raise reached for a switch. “Emer- 


26 


IF 



gency Quarters again! We can’t raise 
anyone, and there are no ships aloft!” 
He leaned forward to open a panel 
under the console-bench, drew out 
a pistol and slipped it in his holster. 

Now Tramp was slowing, swerving 
to match orbits with the planet. Seas 
and continents looked normal beneath 
the blue sky-scatter. Still nothing on 
the radio. Lee took them down, 
switched to gravs and let them settle 
into atmosphere. On the night side of 
the planet, cities glowed normally. 
Tramp slid sideways, away from the 
morning line toward midday, dropped 
toward a large spaceport in a modem- 
looking city. 

And now the radio came to life — 
tersely, in a tight low-powered beam 
aimed at the ship. *^Beam Tramp. 
This is Ted Merk. Sorry I coiddn’t 
reply. We’ve had a scare, and we’re 
under radio silence. Did you see any- 
thing near the Beam? Do you have 
any word where Raise Bukanan is?” 
‘Ted, this is Raise. We didn’t see 
anything before we went into FTL, 
but keep the radio silence. Are you 
at the field?” 

“Yes.” 

R aise stepped to the ground and 
stood for a moment staring 
about the empty field. There should 
have been dozens of ships and a 
lot of ground and air traffic. 

He recognized the subb approach- 
ing him by the ^ght stiffness of the 
feait — a mentally induced quirk, 
not a physical one. ‘Ted! What hap- 
pened?” 

Ted Merk stopped and ran a hasty 
eye over Tramp, as if half expecting 
to see battle damage. “The Eje have 


turned hostile! They grabbed two 
ships just out of the Beam, without 
warning. Another got away and made 
it here to report. Five or six others 
are overdue from various places.” 
Merk gestured at the empty field. “I 
scrambled what ships were around, 
with orders to hide in the cloud for 
a thousand hours or more, skipper’s 
opti<m of courses. I’ve sent word 
throughout the Cluster, but I don’t 
know how many messages got 
through. So far, no Eje have found 
us here, but things are at a standstill.” 
Merk shifted his feet nervously. “I 
didn’t know whether I’d gotten word 
to you or not I sent ships along the 
Beam looking, but . .” 

Dalse realized his own fists were 
clenched. He forced them to relax. 
‘Tei — you mean you sent every- 
thing into the Cloud at low velo- 
citksT 

“Why, yes. We’ve often discussed 
— what’s wrong. Raise? Have I goof- 
ed something?” 

Raise stood rigid until he could 
get his voice working. “You did just 
what you were supposed to do — get 
the ships to safety. But I need a lot 
of diips, fasti There’s something — 
oh, hell. Come aboard, and I’ll show 
you why the Eje are actiffg up!” 

VI 

O ne of the weapons, stripped of its 
trimmed-down disguise, lay on 
the console bench. Ted Merk stared 
at it for a while. “Then they’re really 
after 

“I don’t know,” Raise told him. 
‘They were looking for a man named 
Pank Sunner, who got six of these

somehow. I happened to stumble 
across them. The £je may know by 
now that 1 have them, or they may 
still be looking for Sunner. I’m look- 
ing for Sunner too.” Raise hesitated. 
'Ted, this is the situation. 1 have a 
son who came out from Earth not 
lon^ ago. Sunner happened to meet 
him on Lenare and got him aboard 
ship and off-planet, and now Sunner’s 
demanding ransom. 1 may have to pay 
it.- But even if I do, 1 expect Sunner 
to hold my son as a hostage. I’ve got 
to hunt Sunner down.” 

Ted looked at him for a moment. 
“I never knew you had a son.” 

“Well, I do. I’ve never seen him, 
but he’s grown now, and he’s come 
into space and gotten into a jam. 
This other thing — ” He stopped, 
alerted by something in Ted Mark’s 
manner. “What is it?” 

“Raise . you mentioned ran- 
som. I hope you’re not expecting 
coin metal here.” 

Raise felt a hollowness in his mid- 
dle; He forced himself to relax into 
his seat. “I suppose you’re going to 
tell* me you sent it all into the 
Cloud.” 

Ted nodded slowly. “Most of it. I 
didn’t want to know where it was. 
Ralse^ I -±- ” 

Raise cut him off with a savage 
gesture. “Damn it, let’s not com- 
miserate! You did what you were 
supposed to do! Will any of those 
ships be in radio range?” 

Ted made a resigned gesture. “I 
told each skipper to use his own 
judgment. It’s been several hundred 
hours. Even if they only moved at 
five per cent of light-speed . .” 
Raise stood up and jammed his 


fists into his pockets. “Of course. 
They’d have to come back just as 
slow. And we don’t know what the 
Eje are doing. They could have 
probes of some kind all through the 
Cloud. How much metal do you 
have?” 

“A couple hundred millicreds, in 
rhodium.” 

“How long will it take you to get 
it here? And whatever ships you can 
spare? You must have kept a few, 
for messenger service.” 

“Less than two dozen. I can get 
them and the metal here in four or 
five hours.” 

“Will you get on it right away?” 

Ted Merk left. Raise paced the 
control room for a while, then, be- 
cause he had to occupy his hands, 
went to the bench and put the dis- 
guise back on the weapon. He stood 
holding the thing and trying to get 
his brain working. What could he do 
with the six of them now? The 
Cloud, it seemed, might no longer be 
safe. 

Well, neither was any other place. 

By the time Ted Merk got back. 
Raise at least had a decision, if not 
a plan. “Do you have any of the 
physicists on-planet? A good man?” 

Ted thou^t a moment. “Well, 
there’s Oshima. He’s been working 
with the Bio project, and he’s pretty 
much disillusioned with it. No prog- 
ress.” y 

“Oshima’s fine. Give him a good 
ship and a crew and a staff, and 
whatever apparatus he wants. I’ll give 
you four of these weapons. Tell him 
to take them somewhere — lose 
himself — and begin studying them. 
Tell him to be careful. Just firing

IP 



one will probably bring the Eje down 
on him before he can move, if he’s 
in the Cloud.” 

Ted digested that. “You mean that 
neither of us is to know where 
they are. Suppose something happens 
to him?” 

“Then the word will just have to 
get to us however it can. In^a few 
thousand hours, or less, things may 
be settled one way or another.” 

“M right,” Merk said. “What are 
you going to do with the other two?” 
“That,” Raise reminded him, “is 
something else you don’t want to 
know.” 

L ee White’s programmmg had 
brought Tramp out of FTL close 
to the Beam. There wasn’t much 
problem hopping out of the Cloud, 
of course. You just accelerated and 
went into FTL within whatever rare- 
faction you occupied, and aimed for 
clear space. If you were in a rare- 
faction. Otherwise you crawled out, 
or died of old age trying. 

Raise forced his attention to the 
viewers. He’d half expected a fleet 
of Eje ships to be waiting, but evi- 
dently they weren’t watching this 
stretch of the Beam just now. Maybe 
they were satisfied with whatever in- 
formation they milked out of the cap- 
tured crews. That, Raise thought 
glumly, was one blessing — the subbs 
they’d seized knew nothing about 
the missing weapons, nor about Sun- 
ner. 

The intercom crackled. “Raise, as 
long as there’s nothing on the screens, 
are we going to test that weapon 
before we go into the Beam? Or do 
you want to go along it a ways?” 


Raise pondered morosely. It real- 
ly didn’t matter how far diey went, 
so long as it wasn’t near any traffic 
or any populated worlds. “Take us 
about fifty hours toward Sol. You 
know the kind of place I want.” 
“Sure, Raise.” 

Raise sat watching the image of 
the Cloud. In there — crawling 
wormlike away from Bodega, or pos- 
sibly about to turn back — were the 
ships he needed and the coin metaL 
He could mentally draw a circle upon 
the screen, representing the sphere 
which would include them all. It 
looked like such a small region on 
the screen — yet they were as un- 
reachable, and as stranded for the 
moment, as if they’d been at the 
opposite side of the galaxy. As they 
began to trickle back to Bodega, ltd 
would send them along the Beam 
toward Lenare. Meanwhile, there 
were just fifteen ships available to 
make a few wild stabs along the way. 
He could have used fifteen hundred. 

The chime sounded. They were in 
the Beam. He wished, now, that he’d 
asked Lee for a shorter trip than 
fifty hours. 

R aise, suited, walked into an air- 
lock. The inner door scraped 
shut behind him. He stood holding 
the Eje weapon carefully, hoping his 
gloved hands wouldn’t be too awk- 
ward. A pump began to throb, gulp- 
ing air from the lock. Gradually his 
suit filled out and stiffened. Now 
he could no longer hear via the thin- 
ning air. The outer door slid open, 
and the last of the air went out in a 
rush he could feel. He stepped for- 
ward, braced himself.

The radtibow slash of the Beauty 
off astern, was faiiiy broad. One 
light-year, he’d asked for. The stars 
he could see were few and distant. 
Somewhere, far beyond the last fidnt 
thread hb could see of the fore^ort- 
ened Beahi, was the small cluster 
called Far End. At six thousand 
light-yeais, he couldn’t expect to see 
it. 

Earphones came to life. “Noth- 
ing oh the screens or scopes. Raise. 
We’re coming up on the target. It’ll 
pass you level, about two hundred 
yards out. I can make it farther, if 
you want.” 

“No,” Raise said. “A weapon like 
this, without even a sight, can’t be 
intended for long ranges.” He leaned 
out to look forward. 

The target — a standard Mark 
One cargo pod — was a tiny dot 
ahead, well enough illuminated by 
light from the Beam. He waited while 
it grew to a small disk, then showed 
itself ais a cylinder about as long as 
wide, with a drive-housing flange 
around its middle. A Mark One — 
about eight feet across — wouldn’t 
make a very fat target at two hun- 
dred yards. “Slow us a little, will you, 
Lee?” 

The relative drift of the pod all 
but vanished. He could see the circle 
noW, filling almost all the end, that 
Wsis the hatch. The dot in the middle 
was a tiny glass porthole. He tried 
hi^ thhmb and forefinger against stud 
ahid friggd: and brought the weapon 
up t6 sii^t along the spiderwork bar- 
rel 'A hell of a poor weapon, unless 
it fa^hped out. Carefully, he pressed 
the 'stud under his thumb. 

A glow appeared atop the barrel. 

3b 


He flinched. Then he saw that, some- 
how, the glow formed a ringsight! 
He relaxed his thumb, and the glow 
vanished; he pressed, and it reap- 
peared. A ghost-image in empty 
space! He shifted his head, peered 
through the apparition. He saw the 
cargo pod, magnified about four 
times. He hesitated. It still didn’t 
seem to him the weapon would be 
dangerous to use at two hundred 
yards. “Well, okay,” he muttered, 
and centered the crosshairs on the 
pod. The weapon’s odd ineritea 
helped hold the aim. 

Slowly, he squeezed the trigger. 
Instandy the pod ^owed faintly 
rosy all over and vanished. 

He jerked up his he^ thinking 
he’d simply lost his aun. But the 
pod was gone! “Lee! Did you — ” 

“I saw it, Raise! It just ^appeared! 
We’ve got movies, but — ” There 
was confused talk in Aux Control. 
“Raise, are you completely clear of 
the door?” 

“Huh? Oh — yes!” Raise moved 
back as the outer door slammed shut. 
The inner door opened a crack, and 
air shot in. 

Crewmen waited to help him un- 
suit. When he was free, he thrust the 
weapon at a crewman. “Get the dis- 
guise back on that, will you?” He ran 
for Aux Control. “Did the pod leave 
any track? Is it on radar now?” 

Lee looked at him with a subb’s 
lifeless face. “It just went off every- 
thing, Raise. No squiggle on any of 
the instruments, like there was an ex- 
plosion. It’s just — gone.” 

Raise said, “Pipe it all into Main 
Control, will you?” And he turned 
abruptly. 

IP 



I n Main Control, a crewman came 
once more to join him. They 
strapped in. He felt odd about the 
t^g — not surprised and not real- 
ly exhilarated. Just a little prickly, 
wondering how soon the Eje would 
appear. He was sure they would. He 
glanced at a dial. They’d have to 
hurry to catch him. Lee was pushing 
Tramp toward shift-speed, at a good 
angle relative to the Beam. 

Suddenly Raise reached for the 
intercom switch. “Lee, I’m altering 
program. A hunch.” He jabbed at 
Maincomp’s keyboard. The image of 
the Beam slid sideways across the 
screen. Stars wheeled. The intercom 
chimed warning to the crew. There 
were lurchings, as the artificial gravi- 
ty strove to match Tramp* s lateral 
surge. 

Now she was headed away 
from the Beam at a sharp angle. “I’m 
going to stutter in and out of FTL 
a few times and change direction 
each time and hit the Beam some^ 
where else.” He sat for a while, 
watching screens. 

When a little group of blips ap- 
peared on a televiewer, he called out, 
“Lee, get a telescope and camera 
on that!” 

“Got it, Raise. Let me turn up 
mag .... They’re oval, all right! 
Eje ships! God, they came out al- 
most exactly where you fired that 
thing! Took them about two min- 
utes!” 

Raise said, “Are we getting any 
radar scan?” 

“Not yet. They won’t need it, 
though — we’re still lit enough by 
the Beam. They’ve seen us too, by 
now.” 


Raise said, “Run an analysis and 
see what velocity they came out 
with.” 

Lee muttered. A moment later he 
reported slowly, “They casae out 
with no velocity. Out of what, €jod 
knows. But th^ve got it all over us 
for maneuvering, that’s sure. Hi±t 
And now four of them are gone. Tm 
betting they intercept us!” 

Raise’s spine crawled. But he said, 
“I’m not so sure. I expect, mstead, 
that those four hopped to the Beam 
about where we’d try to enter, two 
in either direction. A wild effort to 
head us off. I think we’ve seen one 
of their limitations. Why did they 
all materialize at the exact spot? 
Why didn’t some of them come imt 
between there and the Beam? That 
would be the optimum chance to 
make an interception.” 

After a minute Lee said, “I see 
what you mean. What way d© you 
figure it?” 

“I think,” Raise said, “that they 
could see just where the weapon was 
fired — but they <fidn’t know where 
that was relative to the Beam. In 
other words, they’re forced to emerge 
at the spot, then look around and 
orient themselves.” 

Lee said, “All right. I’ll beHeve 
that if they don’t intercept us. If 
they do, you’d better come up with 
some real good theories. And you 
better do it fast!” 

But the speed needle was nearing 
its mark — light-speed ^vided by 
the square root of two. The minutes 
crawled by, and the chime soundied. 
Lee’s voice came over the inter- 
com suddenly. “I guess your hunch 
was right.”

fT^he Beam, which had been tedious 
A ’ as usual, was falling away slow- 
ly behind. Lenare’s sun glittered dis- 
tantly. Raise, on the edge of his 
watched a tight trio of radar 
^blips. He’d had them for half a 
minute — which meant there’d been 
more than enough time for his iden- 
tifying radio call to be heard and 
answered. 

Suddenly the receiver crackled. 
**Beam Tramp, this is Kestrel. Nat 
Glover speal^g. I want to board 
yon/^ 

Raise stared at the speaker-grill. 
What had brought Nat Glover out 
here, almost to the Beam? ^"Kestrel, 
we*re accelerating to meet you.” He 
said for the intercom, “Got that, 
Lee?” 

”^e. Raise. We’re moving.” 

It took long minutes for the ships 
to draw together and decelerate. 
Raise *— still guarding his identity — 
did no more talking until he felt the 
locks couple. Then he went to meet 
Nat Glover. 

The lanky man ducked his head 
through the inner door and stood for 
a moment looking from subb to 
subb, until he could pick out Raise. 
His face was unsmiling, and he didn’t 
offer a hand. 

What now, Raise thought. “Thanks 
for being out here, Nat. Let’s go to 
the Control Room.” 

He got Glover seated, made sure 
the intercom was off and studied 
Glover’s face for a minute. “What is 
it, Nat?” 

Nat blurted out, “Did you kill 
Ernesto Vasquez?” 


Raise stiffened. He stared silently 
while his thoughts floundered and 
finally organized themselves, then he 
reached for the intercom switch. 
“Lee. Will you bring in one of those 
gadgets? And a screwdriver?” 

Glover, face grim, sat motionless 
until Lee White arrived. Raise told 
Lee, “I’m leaving the intercom to 
Aux Control open so you can listen 
while you watch your instruments. 
But chase everybody else out, okay?” 

Lee looked at him, at Glover, 
then nodded and left Raise picked 
up the screwdriver and began remov- 
ing the weapon’s disguise once again. 
When it was exposi^ he held the 
thing in front of Glover. “What does 
this look like to you?” 

Glover, face pale, looked from the 
weapon to Ral^ and back. He said 
quietly, “Eje.” 

Raise told him, “Ernesto had six 
of these — disguised — that Sunner 
pawned with him. He already had 
reason to be worried, and when 1 
found how to take the disguises off 
and he saw what they were, he was 
ready to sell them to me. So maybe 
I’m responsible if he’s dead. It’s the 
first I know about it. Sunner may 
have done it. Or the Eje may have. 
If they did, they’re probably after 
me now.” He held up a restraining 
hand as Nat started to say something. 
“Let me finish.” He described the 
visit to New Eden of the peculiar 
strangers. “I’m guessing the same 
bunch may have gone back. But I 
swear to jrou, Nat, that I didn’t kill 
Vasquez. Now give me what details 
you have.” 

Glover sighed. “I’m glad as hell 
you didn’t. 1 don’t know many de-

tails. Some small freigjbter landed, 
killed him and looted his place. The 
buildings were dynamited. There 
weren’t any nearby witnesses left 
alive, but from the description the 
ship could have been this one. I owe 
you an apology, Raise — but I could 
imagine all sorts of things. Ernesto 
apparently died shooting.” 

Raise demanded, “Do you believe 
me now?” 

G lover moistened his lips. “I have 
to. Because the same peculiar 
people came to Lenare, asking about 
Sunner. I thought they were just two 
brothers with poker-faces, but now 
I see ... .” Glover stared at the 
floor for a moment. “They weren’t 
hostile toward me. Do you think they 
killed Vasquez?” 

Raise said, “We have to consider 
it, don’t we?” 

Glover nodded slowly. “Yes. Es- 
pecially since I’ve had another mes- 
sage &om Sunner, and he doesn’t 
seem to have anything new on his 
mind.” Glover probed in a pocket and 
brought out four slender message- 
bars. “They’re not scrambled, but 
they have to be used together. They 
came in four insured packets, 
separately, at different times. Play 
this one ifet.” 

Raise slipped the bar into a slot in 
the consde. There was an alerting 
click from the speaker-grill, then a 
pause during the time when, ordi- 
narily, the date and orig^i of the 
message would be given. Then a me- 
dium-pitched, cultured voice said, “I 
assume that by the time Nat Glover

equipped with a radio beacon of spec- 
ified wavelength and wattage, trans- 
mitting a one-second pulse once per 
minute. The ship releasing the pod 
must leave via the Beam immedidfely. 

“Obviously any boobytraps or 
nonsense such as spies or attempts at 
ambush along the route will end the 
transaction. 

“If these terms are sincerely naet, 
delivery of the goods we hold wiD be 
made within a reasonable time. I 
guarantee goods to be in prime con- 
dition. 

“Three other message-pods are 
being sent separately. When played in 
exact synchronization, theyH ^e 
the specifications here mentioned.” 

There was a brief high-pilcbed 
sound as G^omp Two scanned the 
rest of the bar to make sure fheie 
was no more message, then the bar 
popped halfway out of the dot. 
Glover handed Raise the other three 
bars. Raise pushed each into a dot, 
then turned to the keyboard and 
punched studs to put Comp Two m 
the task of synchronizing the mes- 
sages. He paused, punched another 
stud. “Lee, I’m piping this all to you 
for recording and analysis. See if you 
can figure put what apparatus Sun- 
ner used, will you? And anything 
else you can.” 

“Sure, Raise.” 


WHERE THE SUBBS GO 


33 



The combined message started. 
*"Go precisely twenty light-years out 
the Beam from Lenare, and move 
one-half light-year from the edge of 
the Beam, on the same vector as 
Lenare. For closer position, here are 
star triangulations.” There followed 
a mass of data. Then, ‘‘Near that 
position will be a radio-buoy of the 
given wavelength. That is to be the 
starting-point” 

The conditions went on, in Sun- 
ner’s smooth voice. At the end. Raise 
pushed studs to re-run the whole 
thing, trying to get it in his mind. At 
the end he said to the intercom, 
“Does it sound practical to you, 
Lee?” 

“It sure does, and foolproof too. 
They can drop out of FTL anywhere 
along the pod’s course, grab it and 
run.” 

Glover said, “All the same, an 
ambush could be set up. We could 
have ships popping out all along the 
^way too.” 

“For what?” Raise said irritably. 
‘To throw a missile or an energy- 
beam at some flunky? Sunner won’t 
be there. He’ll let us worry about 
whether the payment gets to him 
safely.” He looked at the chron. “We 
still have four hundred hours. Not 
much, but if we can get some breaks 
for a change .... What have you 
heard about Cetus? 

Nat said, “Thafs a funny thing. 
She did put into Antietam Station. 
But it was later than we figured.” 

“When?” 

Glover named a time. Raise cal- 
culated. ‘‘It’s about right if she made 
another stop or two somewhere. Is 
there any word since then?” 


“No^ but one^ of oiy^ahips^^^^^^^ 
have found some, and not be back 
yet.” 

R aise stood up and jammed his 
fists into his pockets. ‘T doubt 
it. Cetus would almost certainly be 
headed straight out from Antietam 
Station, if she’d already made her 
other stops near there. She’d be be- 
yond your stretch by now. And that 
brings us to some bad news. There’s 
been an Eje scare out near the 
Cloud, and I could only get a few 
ships. And only a fraction of the 
coin metal I expected. I guess that 
leaves you in a jam.” 

Glover made a face. “Bankrupt, if 
we don’t do something fast. But that’s 
not the thing — how about Kime? 
Do you have the ransom?” 

“No. And if I did I wouldn’t ex- 
pect Sunner to let Kime go, once he 
got the money.” 

Glover stared at him. “What are 
we going to do, then?” 

“That’s the prize question, Nat. 
I’ve been wondering whether I could 
trade these weapons back to Sunner 
for Kime. Under our terms. Or 
whether I have the right to do that.” 
Glover’s face slowly turned red, “If 
I understand you, you mean you 
might sacrifice your own son. Be- 
fore I’d do that, I’d call the Eje and 
make a deal with them. Tell them 
all we know about Sunner and offer 
to return their weapons if they help 
us find him.” 

Raise’s feelings boiled over. He 
grabbed up the Eje weapon, thrust 
it into Glover’s hands. Words piled 
up like a log-jam behind his labored 
voice. “Here. I hid four in the Cloud, 


34 


IF 



because 1 thought they’d be safest 
there. I was going to give you one 
to smuggle to Earth, however you 
could — for Mankind’s scientists. 
Now, you decidel You’ve admitted 
the Eje may have killed Vasquez. 
They’ve just recently grabbed ships 
along the Beam, and we don’t know 
what happened to the crews. Here’s 
an Eje artifact — one of the first any 
h uman has ever touched, unless you 
count these damned brown bodies 
like I’m wearing. Go on. Suit up, go 
outside and fire the weapon; that’ll 
bring the Eje fast. Then you can tell 
them how you trust them, and will 
they please be kind to your own 
race and will they help you get 
Raise Bukanan’s son back? Go onl” 
Glover stared at Raise, then down 
at the weapon. Slowly, he laid the 
weapon down. “I’m sorry. Raise. I 
was wrong. We don’t have the rigiht 
to gamble Mankind, do we?” He was 
silent a while. “What are we going 
to do about Kime? What are we go- 
ing to do?” 

Raise turned to stare at the chron. 
“I don’t know. I want you to extend 
your search out along the Beam. 
Cetus may still be whatever faint 
chance we’ve got. As for money — 
rU make a try at Antietam Station. 
1 gave Vasquez a note against my 
fund there. If he didn’t cash it, 
there’ll be enough to keep you operat- 
ing for a little while. Ernesto won’t 
miss it now.” 

T ^ramp^ already outside the Beam, 
sped parallel to it toward Antie- 
tam Station at one-tenth light speed. 
The voice on the beacon said, “Hours 
4698, minutes twelve, seconds zero. 


Mark!” Raise glanced at the chron. 
Just more than a minute fast, allow- 
ing twenty-eight seconds for the bea- 
con’s transmission to reach them. He 
He made no correction. His feelings 
toward Antietam Station were a little 
rebellious. 

A chime announced deceleration. 
Lee White’s voice said, ‘T’m sorry I 
brought us out short. Raise.” 

Raise, annoyed, said, “You did 
fine.” This was no time for irony. 
Emergence only an hour’s run from 
an exact point was more than good 
— it was almost reckless. He turned 
on a forward viewer. A telescope 
easily picked up the cluster of ships 
and larger structures that was the 
Solcon advanced base just short of 
the Sparse Regimis. Some of those 
ships, though he couldn’t pick them 
out yet, would be heavily armed 
scouts or cruisers of the Patrol. 
Others would be freighters from 
various Earth-controlled worlds closer 
in toward Sol, or from Freehold 
worlds scattered among them. Buka- 
nan Enterprises had tp deal there, no 
matter how Raise felt. The vast col- 
lection of space warehouses, business 
offices, banks and such was the only 
place you could pop out'of the Beam 
and do any significant amount of busi- 
ness without making the long run to 
some planet. Antietam itself — the 
planet — was over three hundred 
hours FTL from the Beam, and not 
important except to support the Sta- 
tion and serve as transfer point to a 
number of other worlds. 

A challenge came in: “Ship ap- 
proaching from Outward. Identify 
yourself.” 

Raise sighed and reached for a

transmitting-switch. “This is Beam 
Tramp, a Bukanan Enterprises ship. 
We have financial transactions to 
handle. No cargo. No fixed arma- 
ment We don’t intend to run out to 
Antietam.” 

The voice» when it came again» 
was colder. That, of course, was be- 
cause the Traffic Controller knew he 
was talking to a subb. **Beam Tramp, 
continue present course, then follow 
blinker to parking spot Stay there 
and don’t initiate your business until 
you’re boarded for inspection.” 

R aise controlled the anger that 
stirred in him. “Can you ask 
them to make it quick? We’re press- 
ed for time.” 

The voice said impersonally, “FU 
pass that fact along. Ends.” 

Raise looked at the chron. There 
wasn’t much time to spare, if he 
were to meet Sunner’s schedule. He 
leaned forward in his seat, peering 
at the images of ships. He could pick 
out types now, but nothing that look- 
ed like long, wide-flanged Cetus, It 
would probably be useless an5nvay to 
find Cetus now — so far as the im- 
mediate situation was concerned. 
He’d have to make whaf payment 
he could to Sunner, hoping to tem- 
porize. Sunner’s demand was pre-emp- 
tory, but a good fraction of the ran- 
som and a promise of the rest might 
keep Kime alive. Certainly, Sunner 
would be suspicious — but he’d be 
that in any case, and he was too 
intelligent to do anything drastic and 
irreversible without thinking about it. 

A point of intense light began 
blinking. Raise thumbed the intercom. 
“Got that, Lee?” 


“Sure. Shall I head strai^it for h?” 
“Yes. It’ll be a small Patrol craft. 
Pull close in case it wants to couple 
on right away.” 

Tramp slowed and stopped near a 
small cruiser. Raise waited, the ten- 
seness in his middle getting worse by 
the minute. Hd had no reason to fear 
inspection, except for the two dis- 
guised Eje weapons, but why an in- 
spection at all? Inspections weren’t 
u^eard-of , when some contraband 
was being hunted, but they were rare. 
Had the Eje — conceivably — de- 
manded that the Patrol help them 
in their search? Not likely. But why 
in the hell didn’t they hurry? 

vm 


I t seemed forever, yet it was less 
than half an hour before a shuttle- 
boat approached. The radio said, “Re- 
quest permissiop to couple on.” 
Raise reached jerkily for the trans- 
mitter switch. “Number Three Lock. 
We’ll flash a green light.” 

He listened to the sounds of the 
coupling, started to meet them, 
stopped. Let them come to him. In 
a, few minutes he heard an impatient 
Normal’s voice. The Control Room 
door opened. One of Raise’s crew 
said, “Skipper, this is Lieutenant 
Fromm.” 

The lieutenant was about thirty; 
medium height, husky, a little over- 
fed. He wore a pistol, and so did 
each of the two guardsmen with him. 
The white uniforms were mussed, 
as if their wearers were having a 
busy day. Fromm’s face was a little 
less than friendly. “May I have your 
name. Captain?” 


36 


IF 



Raise hesitated. He certainly didn’t 
want to antagonize the Patrol if he 
could help it; still .... ‘Tm soi^. 
Lieutenant. I’ll give you an identifi- 
cation coding. I’m a Freeholder, with 
a confidential listing.” 

The officer didn’t like it, but he 
said, “That’s your right. Let’s have 
the code.” He turned slightly so the 
recorder-pickup in his left lapel aimed 
straight at Raise. 

When Raise had recited the code- 
number, Formm glanced at Main- 
comp’s screen. “I’d like a replay of 
your log for the last two thousand 
hours, Captain Confidential.” One of 
the guardsmen chuckled and mutter- 
ed, “Captain Johnny Subb.” 

Wordlessly,^ Raise bent over the 
keyboard and punched studs. Times 
and places began rolling across the 
screen. Fromm read them off quiet- 
ly, mouth near his recorder button. 
He stumbled a little over New -Eden, 
glancing at Raise in a startled way. 
When the log was up to the present, 
he said, “Let’s see that New Eden 
visit again.” 

Raise, glad of his subb face, played 
it over. Fromm asked, “Can you sub- 
stantiate those other planet-falls?” 
“Certainly,” Raise said. The fingers 
of anxiety jabbed at his midriff. 
Ordinarily, when he went to Bodega, 
there’d be a falsified record on some 
open planet, showing a visit. This 
tim^ it hadn’t been possible to ar- 
range that. If they checked .... 

But Lieutenant Fromm was inter- 
ested in New Eden. “Do you know 
Ernesto Vasquez, Captain?” 

Raise tried to act calm. “I knew 
him through trade, and freighting 
translations.” 

WHERE THE SUBBS GO 


Fromm raised his eyebrows. 
^*Knewr 

“Lieutenant, I learned less than a 
hundred hours ago that Jl^quez had 
been murdered. I can’t tell you any- 
thing helpful about that. He was alive 
and well when I saw him.” , 
“What was your business there?” 
Raise thou^t frantically. “He’d 
had Bukanan Enterprises handling 
goods on consignment — some kind 
of natural fiber, I think, with special 
properties — and we sold a bunch 
of it. I went to pay him.” 

“We’re an all-subb crew. Lieuten- 
ant. The extra time doesn’t mean 
much to us.” 

The officer grunted. “All right. 
Do you know where your boss is?” 
“My boss? Mostly I work for a 
Mr. Glover on Lenare.” 

“I mean Raise Bukanan.” 

“Oh. No, sir. I don’t think Mr. 
Bukanan’s near this end of the 
Beam.” 

Fromm looked satisfied with that. 
“The C. O. here would like to find 
him. I suppose they’re questioning 
everyone who did business with Vas- 
quez. Now, I’ll have to search your 
ship.” 

“Certainly.” Raise let the lieutenant 
precede him^ from the room. The two 
guardsmen followed behind Raise. 

Tense as a cat, he led the trio 
through the, ship. He had to fight the 
urge to t^ .to bypass the arsenal. 
When he showed it to them, Fromm 
remarked, “You carry quite a few 
weapons.” 

Raise said, “Sometimes we make 
planetfall in pretty rough places. 
And sometimes we hunt our own 
meat.” 


37 



The lieutenant turned away with- 
out touching any of the racked guns. 
Raise let out his ^eath and un- 
clenched his fists. 

Later» he didn’t dare protest when 
the officer said» ‘Tou’re clear. But 
I’m afraid we’ll have to ask you to 
wait a while longer and maintain 
radio silence. You’re the first ^pper 
we’ve found who saw Vasquez re- 
cently. The C. O. may want to ask 
a few more questions.” 

R aise furiously paced Aux Control. 

Lee White dumped in a seat, 
watching him. “Raise, we’ve got al- 
most two hours to spare.” 

‘Two hours!” Raise whirled toward 
Lee. “If I know the Patrol, it’ll be 
more like ten! Anyway, that’s not 
the worst of it. We’re stalled on 
everything else. I can’t make inquir- 
ies about Cetus — what she lo^ed 
or dropped, and so on — and I can’t 
radio the bank and get money.” He 
turned to stare glumly at a view- 
screen. “What would you say our 
chances are of making a run for it? 
We could use some of these parked 
ships for cover.” 

White peered at him, then gestured 
at the screen. “With that cruiser 
standing off there? We’d have to 
move clear of the other ships to head 
toward the Beam. We’d get a hole 
melted in us before we could move 
a mile! Anyway, Raise, what’s the 
use of keeping that appointment 
without the money?” 

. “I don’t know. But I’ve got to 
keep it! I’m going to Main Control 
and radio the C. O. If he wants to 
talk to me, he can talk now!” 

It took half an hour to get as high 


as the C. O.’s adjutant, a Colond 
Paige. He wasn’t happy with Raise’s 
demand. “General Nalty isn’t on 
duty. You can’t expect him to sit at 
his desk around the clock, to answer 
every complaint that comes in.” 
Raise said, “Are you on duty?” 
“Yes.” 

“Well, then you can talk to me. 
I’ve been inspected and found clear, 
but told to wait for more questioning. 
I’ve got urgent business to handle. 
What are the questions? Ask them, 
and get it over with!” 

An exasperated grunt came over 
the radio. “I haven’t the damnedest 
idea what’s involved. Who did you 
say you are, again?” 

‘I’m skipper of Beam Tramp. 
We’re a Bukanan Enterprises ship. 
We landed on New Eden some time 
before the planet’s Freeholder, Ernes- 
to Vasquez, was murdered, and I 
talked with him. That’s what the 
questions are about.” 

There was an “Oh,” of surprise, 
and a pause. Then, “Let me get the 
file. It’s on the general’s desk.” A 
wait. “Hello. I see there’s a very new 
entry here, marked ‘ConEdential’ I 
can’t discuss that via radio without 
your permission. Do I have it?” 
Raise hesitated. Anyone listening 
might be curious enough to probe. 
“On two conditions: that we scram- 
ble and that you accept the respon- 
sibility personally of the confidential 
knowledge.” 

Raise could hear the other gear- 
ing under his breath. Finally, “I’ll 
call the general. He’ll radio you with- 
in twenty minutes.” 

Raise, feeling savage, sat staring 
at the chron. 


38 


IF 



B ut General Nalty was prompt. 

His voice was quiet, older than 
the adjutant’s. **Beam Trampl Gen- 
eral Nalty calling.” 

“General, Fm sorry to make such 
a fuss. By now, I guess you’ve talked 
to your adjutant. In the file on your 
desk, there’s a confidential identity 
coding. I suggest we use it as a key 
to set up a radio scramble.” 

“All right,” the general said easily, 
“but if it’s agreeable, let’s make it 
video as well.” 

“Surely,” Raise said. Looking at 
him wasn’t going to help the general 
any. 

There was a short wait, while the 
Patrol’s computers were linked in, 
then the scrambled circuit came 
through. General Nalty was a rather 
slight man; sixty at least, his scalp 
and face clean-shaven. He wore casual 
off-duty zipperalls. His sharp dark 
eyes peered from the screen at Raise. 
“I’ve just looked up that confidential 
identity. I’m very much surprised, 
Mr. Bukanan. You’ve kept your 
secret well.” 

Raise sighed. There were some 
people who had to know. “It’s been 
necessary. General, there are things 
I have to do in a hurry. I’m sorry 
to be demanding about it, but if you 
want to talk about Ernesto Vasquez 
can we get on with it?” 

Nalty smiled. “I’d have been on 
the air the minute you arrived, if 
I’d known. Mr. Bukanan, when you 
talked to him did he give you any 
hint that he feared for his life?” 
Something in the general’s sharp 
scrutiny warned Raise he’d better 
stay as near the truth as he dared. 
“Well ... I’d have to say he was 


nervous about something. I’d known 
him quite a while.” 

“And he knew who you were?” 
Raise hesitated. “Yes.” 

“Fm forced to be curious, Mr. 
Bukanan, as to why you paid him 
such an amount of money.” 

Raise stared at the screen. All he 
could think of was, “What amount of 
money?”. 

Nalty smiled again. “The personal 
note you gave him. His wife cashed 
it here. She and their son arrived 
so promptly that Fm sure he must 
have sent them off-planet almost im- 
mediately after you left.” 

R aise slumped back into his chair. 

Finally — with sincerity — he 
managed, “Fm glad they’re safe. I 
hadn’t heard.” 

Nalty said, “If you’re reluctant to 
talk because you fear you’re a sus- 
pect, let me put you at ease. In the 
first place, we naturally know a great 
deal about your corporation and its 
dealings. Murder, and the re-taking 
of a personal note, don’t fit the 
pattern. Secondly, Mrs. Vasquez and 
the boy are able to tell us a little. 
We can pinpoint Beam Tramp's visit, 
at a time when they were practical- 
ly alone. You could have used force 
on him then, if you’d wanted to. 
You left peacefully. Thirdly, they’ve 
told us Vasquez had shady dealings 
with other people.” The general 
paused to watch Raise, then resumed. 
“It’s obvious from the use of dyna- 
mite that whoever killed him was 
looking for something. Sit in my chair 
for a minute, Mr. Bukanan. It will 
save me the trouble of asking a lot 
of questions.” 




WHERE THE SUBBS GO 



Raise sat silent for a while, mind 
churning. If the general only knew — 
if Raise were to say bluntly, “I have 
strong reasons for suspecting the Eje 
may have killed Vasquez, and if 
you’ll come aboard I’ll show you,” 

— what a volcano of activity would 
erupt at Antietam Station! But he 
couldn’t do anything like that. He 
couldn’t even name Sunner, if he 
wanted Kime to live. He pulled him- 
self erect in his seat. 

“General, a man — an outlaw — 
has something that’s extremely im- 
portant to me. I’ve been trying to 
find him. That’s why I went to New 
Eden, and that’s connected with the 
payment to Vasquez, and that’s why 
I ^ve to leave here now. If I could 
tell you anything, 1 would, but right 
now it would sink me. What’s the 
Patrol’s interest in this, anyway?” 

Nalty said quietly, “Why, if Vas- 
quez was handhng contraband, most 
of it was undoubtedly from Solcon 
worlds. For that matter, we’ve had 
stuff pirated from the Patrol itself. 
And Mrs. Vasquez has asked us for 
protection.” 

Raise darted a frantic look at the 
chron. “General, my crisis comes up 
in a few hours. You know who I am 

— you can hold that over me. I givQ 
you my word that as soon as things 
break, if I’m still alive. I’ll name 
at least one man Vasquez was dealing 
with.” 

Nalty smiled. “And of course that’s 
the man you’re after now. Why don’t 
you let me help you? I’ve handled 
things discreetly before.” 

“And some indiscreetly,” Raise 
said. “I’ve got to go now. Are you 
going to try to stop me?” 


Nalty said, “I could, you know.” 
Raise reached for the switch. 
“You’d have to shoot. All you would 
get would be a hull full of dead 
Johnny Subbs. Good-by, GeneraL” 
“Good-by, Johnny Subb, and good 
luck. I hope you make it back to 
keep that promise.” 

IX 

T Wamp was almost ready to emerge 
from the Beam again. Raise 
paced Aux Control, trying desperate- 
ly to think of some gimmick that 
would force Sunner to give him more 
time. “The hell of it is,” he told Lee 
White, “we don’t know what Sunner 
knows by now. If he killed Vasquez, 
he may or may not think the weapons 
are still on die planet. He may know 
/ have them. If he has spies in the 
right places, he could know about 
that personal note of mine.” 

Lee said, “Why would he want to 
pawn the things there, then go back 
after them before he got the ransom 
from us?” 

Raise stopped and stood, fists 
jammed into his pockets. “Maybe he 
got money some place else. Or maybe 
he’s found a hiding place he thinks 
is secure enough.” 

“Well,” Lee said, “what if he 
didn't kill Vasquez? Somebody did. 
If he knows about it, he’ll be wonder- 
ing hard.” 

“Of course,” Raise said. “Unless 
he knows about that note. Or he may 
know the Eje are around, and assume 
they got their property back. I can’t 
begin to guess what he’d do in that 
case. Go on trying to collect from 
us, I guess. Hell, he may not even 


40 


IF 



kndW Vasquez is dead! How can I 
work out any kind of a story that 
will convince him» when 1 don’t know 
what he knows?” 

Lee asked» “What kind of story 
did you have in mind?” 

“I thought I might say the Patrol 
has all my funds tied up temporarily. 
Or that the Eje have been following 
me around. That last, thou^ might 
scare him away completely.” Raise 
threw a glance at the chron. “Damn 
it!” 

Lee said, “It’ll take us a while 
outside, maybe, to find that radio 
buoy.” 

Raise shook his head. “We’ll come 
out close, you know that. He picked 
a stretch we could compute down to 
the second.” 

“One thing,” Lee said, “as soon 
as we launch the pod, we can get to 
Nat Glover fast. He may have heard 
something by now. Anyway, with two, 
three more ships we mi^t make a 
stab at something.” 

Raise stared at him irritably. “The 
time for all that’s gone. What I need 
right now is some story to convince 
Sunner I’m not just stalling. If I 
could have gotten money at Antie- 
tam — ” 

“We’ve got a little aboard,” Lee 
said. 

“Sure.” Raise went to a seat and 
threw himself into it, “Little enough 
to look like an insult. It might make 
him mad enough to chop a finger 
off Kime and send it to me. I don’t 
want my son back a piece at a time.” 

“I can see that,” Lee said. “What 
about your other idea? Telling him 
you’ve got the weapons and offering 
to trade them for Kime?” 


Raise said bitterly, “I’ve got my- 
self crossed up there too. How can 
I send a message saying I don’t have 
the money he wants, but I do have 
the weapons he’s missing, but I can’t 
get at them for a couple of thousand 
hours? If you were Sunner how 
would you react?” 

Lee White sighed. “The onlyjhing 
left, then, is just to offer the trade 
and pretend you’ve got all six right 
in your hands. At least, that’ll gain 
a little time.” 

Raise shot a look at the chron, 
and got compulsively to his feet. “Be- 
fore I’ll do that I’ll go to Sunner my- 
self and talk. I can take the weapon 
we’ve got, to convince him. And de- 
pending on where he is and various 
other things, I can play it by ear.” 

White stared at him. “I don’t get 
you. Raise. You mean you’ll just put 
a note in the pod, offering to meet 
him?” 

“I mean,” Raise said hoarsely, “I’ll 
put myself in the pod. We can put in 
a full atmosphere, and some extra 
cannisters and a warmer, and some 
rations. I can wear a suit and only 
seal up when they come to get the 
pod. Whoever comes will be expen- 
dable, obviously, and therefore not 
able to make decisions. When I tell 
them Sunner will waftt to see me and 
he’ll be damned mad if they don’t 
take me to him, they’ll have to do 
it!” 

Lee White sat up rigidly. “Raise, 
you can’t think of that! Why, hell — 
whoever else is, you’re not expenda- 
ble!” 

“I’m not? Look at the shape the 
Corporation’s in right now. If I can 
get Kime back, we’ll have to go out 


WHERE THE SUBBS GO

to the Cloud and try to salvage what 
we can. If I don’t make it — well, 
the piec^ will have to shift for them- 
selves, And if the Eje bust things wide 
open^ none of us will matter anyway,” 
“But Raise — you couldn’t just 
go and put yourself in his hands!” 
Raise stared at him in specula- 
tion, *Tve been thinking that 1 can 
do just that, Lee, He doesn’t know 
Raise Bukanan’s a subb, remember? 
And he won’t expect any messenger 
who’s important He’ll think 1 <im 
expendable. Just another Johnny 
Subb with, a message to deliver, and 
no other information worth* the 
squeezing,” He turned to the door. 
“Let’s get to work on that pod!” 

R aise sat slumped in the pod, A 
dim glow-bulb was the only il- 
lumination. There was artificial gravi- 
ty — a twentieth G; a cargo pod 
needed a little to keep its loads in 
place. Raise had it directed so the 
aft end, as the pod now moved, was 
“down.” His sleeping pad was rolled 
up so it didn’t cover the tiny port- 
hole in that end, but there wasn’t 
much diversion in staring back at the 
Beam. It might as well have been a 
painting. At the pod’s velocity — a 
twentieth li^t-s^eed — it would be 
a long time before the Beam receded 
noticeably. 

He reached for a squeezer and took 
a sip of broth, more out of boredom 
than because he wanted it After the 
first few hours he’d stopped looking 
out the forwiurd porthole because the 
few remote stars only reminded him 
how alone he was. Nevertheless, of 
course, those two hand-sized port- 
holes were indispensable. ^Aout 


them his imprisonment would have 
been unbearable. The other objects 
in the pod helped a little. Every few 
hours he unrolled the sleeping pad 
and lay down on it, just for the 
change. Now, and again he picked 
up the disguised Eje weapon and 
fondled it, or re-piled his provisions. 
Another thing that helped surprising- 
ly was the radio beacon. As it sent 
out its periodic call, it buzzed faintly. 
He talked to it sometimes and wait- 
ed for it to buzz in answer. All in all, 
he was calm except when he got to 
wondering if Sunner’s men would ever 
come at all. If not — well, in a 
thousand hours Lee and Beam 
Tramp were supposed to try to find 
him. If the course and speed were 
accurate enough, and if nothing hap- 
pened to Lee in the meantime, he 
might be found. 

He’d have thought Sunner’s move 
would have been made before now. 
He’d been in the pod almost fifty 
hours. There was really no need for 
the outlaws to wait so long — closer 
in, the pod would have deviated less, 
and been easier to find; and their 
danger was nil anyway. Maybe the 
Eje had caught Sunner. 

He shifted his position. “Damn it. 
I’ve been all over that!” He got to 
his feet, brought his face close to 
the forward port to peer out. Stars. 
Brilliant, cold, remote. He sat down 
on the roUed-up pad and listened to 
the beacon’s buzz. 

What was he going to say when 
they picked him up? That would be 
the easiest part What would he say 
to Sunner, if he ever reached him? 
The fact was, he hadn’t been able 
to think that through. “Damn it! 


42 


IE 




I’ve had plenty of time to thinkl” 

He twisted to pick up a cannister, 
turned the valve and let oxygen hiss 
out. The sound seemed very loud. 
Before long, he’d have to do more 
than valve oxygen. Already his breath- 
ing was a littie forced because of the 
excess carbon dioxide. In the pile of 
provisions was a small reconditioning 
pump that would cycle the air throujgh 
a solution of lime-water. He’d been 
almost sure, though, he wouldn’t have 
to drift long enou^ to need that. 

What was he going' to say to Sun- 
ner? Hell; he was never going to get 
to Sunner. 

His lungs ached a little from 
breathing unnecessarily hard. “Got 
to do something about this air.” He 
bent forward, began to look for the 
reconditioning pump — and went 
rigid. 

A ' dim shifting light gleamed off 
the edge of- the forward port- 
hole. He stared at it for a moment, 
then reached frantically for the plas- 
tic suit’s detachable helmet. He 
fumbled at the sealing-grooves hastily; 
realized he was being stupid. “Plenty 
of time!” More calmly, he got the 
helmet over his head and sealed on. 
Then he pressed his fingertips on a 
spot at the waistband. Oxygen hissed 
from the cannister at the small of his 
back. He let the pressure build up 
enough to round out the helmet, 
then let the valve close. A few 
breaths of the rich mixture cleared 
his wits. He stood tensely, looking up 
while the light grew stronger and 
shone into the pod so that he had 
to blink. He could picture a ship, 
already at nearly matched velocity, 

I

maneuvering to couple end-on. The 
)ar came. He had to take two quick 
$teps to catch his balance. Then he 
^vaited> gloved hands clasped atop his 
telmet in the gesture of surrender, 
lie heard air slam into the ship’s lock, 
t^eq there were clumping sounds, and 
sonaeone began to work at the fasten- 
of the hatch on that end of the 

pod. 

They left the hinge-catch on one 
side attached, and swung the hatch 
^ide. flight spilled into the pod. He 
stared up at two men — standing at 
right-angles to him, since their gravi- 
ty^ was set that way. They stared 
back. 

One was big and burly, with 
blond hair, beard and mustache all 
cropped half an inch long. The other 
was, smaller, and wiry, clean-shaven, 
including his scalp. Both wore zipper- 
alls, gray and not too clean, and 
carried old-fashioned revolvers on 
their hips. It was the wiry one who 
uttered a sudden oath and grabbed 
for his gun. 

' ,i!he big one moved fast and knock- 
ed the gun aside. “Hold on!” To 
liialse he said in a flat voice, “What 
the hell are you doing here?” 

Raise spoke loudly so his voice 
would carry through the helmet. “I 
have messages for Pank Sunner.” 
i^e wiry one snarled, “We don’t 
know any Pank Sunner!” 

^Ralse didn’t have to put on any 
acte. He simply said, “All I know 
is* Raise Bukanan said whoever pick- 
ed up this pod would take me to 
Pank Sunner.” 

The wiry one swore again. “Any 
nioney in that pile of stuff?” 

“No,” Raise said. 


The big one said, “Let’s have the 
message. I’m Pank Sunner.” 

Raise said woodenly, “I’ve seen 
Pank Sunner. That was why Mr. 
Bukanan picked me.” 

The blond man grinned. “All right, 
Johnny Subb, maybe you’re telling 
the truth. Climb out of there.*’ He 
stood back. 

Raise climbed out carefully and 
got to his feet in the lock. “There’s 
a rifle in there that’s supposed to 
prove something to Mr. Sunner. I 
don’t know what.” 

The burly spaceman looked at 
Raise, then into the pod. “Get it,” 
he said to "the other. 

Raise watched tensely while they 
examined the ‘rifle.’ It didn’t seem 
to mean anything to them. The big 
one asked, “Anything else in there 
you need?” 

“No.” 

The blond man told the other, 
“Close it up and cut loose and let 
it drift. It may be bugged some way. 
I’ll take Johnny Subb inside.” 

A fter that the time on the pick-up 
ship was uneventful. She was a 
type not too different from Beam 
Tramp, manned by fifteen very pro- 
fessional thugs — more than were 
needed to handle the ship. She had 
an arsenal in which were locked 
whatever weapons she carried other 
than the pistols the crew wore. They 
treated Raise in various ways, rang- 
ing from tolerant contempt (that 
from the big blond man, who was 
skipper and who was called Briney) 
to surly resentment. He slept alone, 
locked in a small compartment, and 
ate alone in the galley, washing 


44 


IF 



his own dishes. They took his wrist- 
watch» of course^ and didn’t let him 
see any chrons. Most of the ship was 
off limits to him. 

Still, he could tell when they 
shifted in and out of FTL and when 
they entered and left the Beam. He 
judged the trip was enough to take 
them halfway to New Eden, if they 
were headed outward from Sol. That 
wasn’t much information. He could 
be off by two hundred light-years, 
and of course they might be headed 
any direction away from the Beam 
once they emerged. 

The time came when big Briney 
told him, ‘*Suit up. We’re taking a 
shuttleboat.” 

Briney and the wiry man, with 
one other crewman, escorted him. 
There were four odier ^ps adrift 
in lonely space. He didn’t get a good 
look at ^em until the boat ap- 
proached one, then he sat staring 
through the forward porthole. 

The ship was the huge Cetus. 

Of course! Given o&er ships to 
run errands, Cetus would be a com- 
fortable, ideal hideout! She needn’t 
make planetfall nor even go near 
the Beam, and she could move about 
as Sunner thought prudent. And — 
with some equipment — she’d be a 
perfectly good lab for studying the 
Eje weapons! 

All Sunner was waiting for, prob- 
ably, was the ransom money. (And 
— of course — the weapons). Raise 
grinned inwardly. If Sunner didn’t 
know yet that he’d lost them, this 
visit would be a shock. And if he 
did know, having one suddenly placed 
in his hands should jolt him. 

The amusement didn’t last long. 


Raise suddenly realized that Beam 
Tramp, Glover’s ships, the few from 
Bodega — all were on a wild goose 
chase, looking for Cetus and for 
hints of a planet where Sunner mighf 
be hiding out. They weren’t gohig 
to get any recent word of Cetus. 
Almost certainly, Sunner had pirated 
her shortly after she left Antietam 
Station. No doubt he’d had a ren* 
dezvous set up with her. 

Where did this leave Raise? A 
little more on his own. It would be 
fitting, he thou^it, if Cetus were 
named instead Moby Dick. He’d 
pawned everything to find her. And 
now that — unexpectedly — htfd 
found her himself, he might not sur- 
vive the encounter. 

Suddenly, thou^, he had the first 
glimmering of how he might bargain 
with Sunner. 

X 

S unner, Raise saw, had a clean, or- 
derly, almost luxurious office &ed 
up for himself aboard Cetus. The 
big desk, with a few books neatly 
piled atop it, might have belonged 
to some executive on Earth. 

Sunner was neat, too. The even 
shade of his Latin skin suggested 
regular use of tan-lotion. He was 
clean-shaven except for two fore-and- 
aft strips of short black hair on his 
head, in what Raise guessed mi^t 
be a current Earth fashion. His 
white zipperalls were immaculate 
and fit his slight body well. He wore 
a scarf of soft white material around 
his throat (hiding, Raise knew, an 
ugly knife-scar) secured with a small 
plain clasp of what might be plati- 


WHERE THE SUBBS GO 


45 



num. On the breast pocket of the 
zipper^, over his heart, were em- 
broidered the initials P. A. S. 

Just now, the manicured hands 
held the disguised Eje weapon. They 
handled it deftly, but with a certain 
greed. Raise could see in Sunner’s 
face the urge to look inside the 
disguise, but the pirate controlled it. 
Slowly he laid the thing on his desk. 
His dark eyes, fixed on Raise, were 
intense. His right hand dipped below 
the desk, and Raise presumed it 
now held a handgun. A needle-pistol 
— that was supposed to be Sunner’s 
preference. The black eyes flicked 
toward the guard standing behind 
Raise; the neat head inclined just 
slightly. The guard left and closed 
the door behind him. 

Sunner eyed Raise thoughtfully. 
“Where did your boss get this?” 

“I don’t know.” Raise knew Sun- 
ner had recognized the falsework 
on the weapon, slimmed down as it 
was. The instant’s spasm of the dark 
face had revealed that. 

The dark eyes narrowed with 
anger. “Don’t play coy with me, 
Johnny Subb. What did Bukanan tell 
,you? What are you supposed to say 
to me?’’ 

■ Raise forced his body to stay re- 
laxed. “There’s some gadget inside 
that , rifle that you’re supposed to 
know about. I’ve seen it but I don’t 
know what it is. Mr. Bukanan’s 
message is this: he has five more, 
in a place where he can’t get at 
them for two thousand hours. He’s 
willing to give you this one as down 
payment. When he gets the others 
»back^ he’ll give you two more. You 
are :.to hold his son in the mean- 


time. When you have the three, 
you’re to let his son go. Then Mr. 
Bukanan will give you a complete 
partnership in the investigation of the 
things.” 

Sunner looked startled, then laugh- 
ed tightly. “You must have left out 
something. That sounds as if he 
thought I were a complete fool.” 
Raise said, “He offers a lot. He’ll 
equip you with whatever apparatus 
you want, so that you won’t have to 
run the risks of acquiring it yourself. 
He’ll give you money to operate on. 
Then, at regular intervals or when- 
ever you like, one of your ships can 
meet one of his and exchange in- 
formation. He doesn’t care that you’ll 
be getting the best of the exchange. 
You can use the weapons or what- 
ever you develop from them in any 
way you wish so long as you don’t 
bother Bukanan ships or proper- 
ty, and he won’t bother you. He says 
Space is big enough for both of you.” 

S unner sat staring at him. Suspicion 
and greed flickered across the well 
kept face. “Why,” the pirate asked 
finally, “should 1 let him have three 
of the weapons? I have his son. And 
why does he offer this proposition in 
the first place? Why didn’t, he simply 
pay the ransom and say nothing 
about the weapons?” 

“Because his cash position’s tight 
just now.” Raise hesitated. Maybe he 
could fish a little. “A man named 
Vasquez demanded a lot of money 
that Bukanan Enterprises owed him. 
The talk is that it took everything 
we had in the way of coin met^ just 
now.” 

Sunner’s face twitched, then rippled 



with thought. “So,” he said present- 
ly, his voice a little shaky. “That’s 
how it happened.” He seemed to be 
talking to himself, for he looked 
quickly at Raise and shut up. 

Raise’s pulse leaped. He was al- 
most sure Sunner was thinking about 
the weapons. And there was a trace 
of guilt in Sunner’s manner. Did that 
mean he*d killed Vasquez? Maybe. 

Sunner’s face was guarded now. 
“What if I refuse? I’ve got money 
and ways of getting scientific equip- 
ment. And I have one of the wea- 
pons, now.” 

Raise took a breath. Sooner or 
later he’d have to make the bluff. 
“Mr. Bukanan has five, and much 
better facilities. I’m to tell you he 
wants his son back, but not badly 
enough to risk bankruptcy. They 
weren’t close, and Mr. Bukanan’s 
angry with him for getting himself 
into this jam. If you don’t agree 
to the partnership, everything’s off. 
He’ll hunt you down and kill you, 
as a matter pf principle. But he won’t 
bargain.” 

Sunner’s eyes were deadly. “Did 
he think I’d bargain with youT 

“I have no authority to bargain, 
Mr. Sunner. I’m to deliver the mes- 
sage and do one other chore and re- 
port back. That’s all.” 

“Oh?” Sunner looked at him for 
a moment. “What was the other 
chore?” 

“You’re to show me Kime Bukan- 
an. I sa\^ him on Lenare, so I’ll 
recognize him. If I don’t return and 
report that Kime’s all riglht, Mr. 
Bi^anan will assume he’s dead.” 

Sunner snarled; half raised the 
hand holding the gun. Then he asked. 


voice full of fury, “How are you 
supposed to get back?” 

Raise tried to sound humble and 
unimportant. “He assumed you’d de- 
liver me back to Lenare or some 
Bukanan holding near it.” 

There was a minute when Raise 
thought Sunner’s rage would get the 
upper hand. Then, abruptly, the pi- 
rate had control of it. He smiled. 
“Was Bukanan on Lenare?” 

“No, sir. He talked to me out at 
the Beam.” 

Slowly, Sunner got to his feet. 
Without t akin g his eyes off Raise 
for more than a moment at a time, 
he picked up the weapon, walked to 
what looked like a spacesuit cabinet, 
thrust the weapon in, took a tey 
from inside the cabinet, locked that 
and slipped the key in his pecket. 
Then he came to sit down at his desk 
again, and leaned toward an intercom 
grill. “Briney.” 

“Yes, sir,” came from the inter- 
com. 

“Bring in that special guest.”- 


B riney and his wiry companion 
herded Kime in, then locked 
the door and stood just inside it. 

Raise stood looking at his son, glad 
his face showed none of the turmoil 
inside him. Kime had the same kind 
of bridged nose Raise had had, <»ce. 
He couldn’t remember whether his 
own cheekbones had been that promi- 
nent, or whether his chin had thrust 
out so — but of course Kime was 
sullen now, and gaunt. As Nat Glover 
had said, his frame was good, but 
he needed hard work and solid food 
to bulk it out. Not that his hands— 
clenched now at his sides — looked

4J 



as if they were total strangers to 

‘Wbrk. 

- '^Raise’s middle felt hollow. Now 
tiiat he’d seen Kime, it was going to 
bo very hard to leave, acting calm. 
.He watched Kime’s eyes. So far, 
they’d only glanced at him. They 
were the only features, really, that 
reminded him of Kime’s mother. 
There was a dignity in them, as well 
as the smoldering anger. He was glad 
:to see both. 

Sunner was watching Kime blandly. 
.“Johnny Subb here is from your 
father. He’s supposed to report back 
that you’re all in one piece.” 

Kime looked at Ral^ again, and 
Raise saw, behind the cool loo^ the 
desperate question. Sunner must have 
^en it too. He smiled. “We’re not re- 
leasing you yet. Your father seems 
to be more anxious to get Johnny 
Subb back, to report on some busi- 
ness we’re discussing.” 

Kime flushed. “You can go to 
heU!” 

Sunner laughed. “Lock him up 
again.” 

Briney turned to unlock the door^ 
stepped out and beckoned to Kime. 
Kime made a move to obey, then 
stopped. He looked back at Sunner, 
then at Raise. There was a hopeless- 
, ness in his eyes now. But the anger 
^yas still there, and it was growing. 
Raise saw the explosion starting. He 
took a step forward, said hoarsely, 
“Np!” 

B ut Kime was beyond listening. 

With an inarticulate sound, he 
hurled himself toward Sunner. 

Raise leaped to stop him, was too 
vfar away, saw Sunner’s pistol come 

4B 


up, heard the sharp, “Spat! Spat!” 
as the slim high-velocity missiles left 
it. Kime, hit in bo(h thighs, stumbled, 
caught the edge of the desk, lunged 
across it Raise was already around 
it, diving toward Sunner. A coarser 
gun — the wiry guard’s — roared. 
Kime jerked violently. Briney roared, 
“You fool!” and flattened the other 
guard with a blow of a gun-butt. 
Sunner was confused for just an in- 
stant — maybe he thought Raise was 
still trying to stop Kime — and that 
gave Raise the tioie he needed. He 
was upon the pirate, jabbing hard 
at the throat with the knuckles of 
his left hand. The man reeled back, 
and Raise grabbed at the needle-gun. 
Before he could wrest it away he had 
to swing a fist hard at the temple. 
Sunner went limp and fell. A slug 
from Briney’s gun slammed into 
Raise’s left shoulder. That didn’t mat- 
ter — a subb body could take a lot. 
He spun, getting his finger on the pis- 
tol’s trigger, brought it up above the 
level of the desk. A slug tore into 
his chest, knocking him backward. 
But he aimed and pulled the trigger, 
and the needles laced into Briney. 
The big blond man grunted, clutch^ 
at himself and went down. Raise 
stumbled around the desk. Kime lay 
face up, chest jerking. There were 
shouts. Raise staggered to the door, 
pulled it shut and locked it. 

The intercom was calling, “Mr. 
Sunner? Mr. Sunner?” Raise reeled 
back and leaned on the desk while a 
spasm of coughing racked him, then 
went to his knees beside Kime. Kime’s 
blood was spilling out fast, and he too 
was coughing some up. Raise thought 
dazedly. We're both dying — but Vm 


IP 



a subb; Vll last long enough to see 
him go. He stared around desperately. 
There must be a first-aid room 
aboard. If Sunner could be forced to 
.... He raised himself to stare at 
Sunner. 

Sunner looked dead. 

Someone was pounding at the door. 
Raise lifted his head — it felt very 
heavy now — to peer that way. 
Briney and the other guard lay mo- 
tionless, and the door was holding. 

Kime’s eyes were open now, but 
dull. ‘Tell my father I . idn’t 

want to ... be a ” He shuddered, 

and his eyes closed. His breathing was 
very ragged now. 

Raise snarled in desperation. If he 
could shoot his way to ... 

Shoot, Something gnawled at his 
mind. 

The Eje weapon! 

Frantically he struggled to his feet, 
lurched to Sunner’s body and fum- 
bled in pockets for the key, then 
forced his feet to carry him to the 
cabinet. He had trouble getting the 
key in the slot. He finally got the 
cabinet open, grasped at the weapon. 
Would the Eje come in time to save 
Kime’s life? He got the weapon out, 
staggered to the desk with it, laid it 
down and felt clumsily in his pockets 
for the screwdriver he had. 

There was a loud clang. Some- 
one was using a sledgehammer on the 
door. He ignored that, found the 
screwdriver, began working with ter- 
rible awkwardness at the weapon’s 
disguise. 

Suddenly he stopped. What if the 
Eje came in time . but made 
Kime a subb? 

He crouched there in agony of 
WHERE THE SUBES GO r 


indecision. Did he have the right to 
bring the Eje anyway — even if be 
could? If the weapon worked inside 
Cents, and they got here, they’d know 
too much. They’d ^e able to identify 
Kime, at least. 

He thought of Annelle Travis, 
waiting, not knowing. 

Desperately, he resumed work. 
The disguise came apart. The sled^ 
hammer slammed at the door, which 
shuddered. The top hinge was off 
now. He got his hand around the 
grip, of the alien weapon; concen- 
trated hard to get the trigger guard 
swtmg clear. He was nearly gone 
now, he knew. He lifted the weapon 
as nearly upward as his feeble arms 
would allow and squeezed the trig- 
ger. 

He knew that the room filled with 
a rosy glow; then there was some- 
thing like death. 

Yet not quite death. Somewhere, 
within his brain or out, there was a 
kind of awareness — a dim primor- 
dial awareness that he was, and that 
was passing. 

XI 

S mells were the first real thing he 
recognized as consciousness slow- 
ly returned — isopropanol, ether, 
some phenol-like odor, and subtler, 
more exotic medicine-smells. He pon- 
dered fuzzily. Where had he smelled 
those combined smells before? 

In the Eje hospital at Far End, 
of course. 

He squirmed and tried to fight his 
way out of the lassitude. His own 
voice mumbled disjointedly. A throb 
began in his chest. A voice — not his 

4 ^ 





own — said something, and a sharps 
ness tingled in his nostrils, making 
him swirl dizzily for a moment When 
the dizziness left, he was calmer and 
the pains in hh chest were mere 
twinges. He willed himself awake. Fi- 
nally, miraculously, the leaden ^bs 
that were his eyelid loosened, lighten- 
ed, rose. 

“How do you feel, Raise Bukan- 
an?” 

The voice was not as toneless as a 
subb’s, nor as inflected as a Nor- 
mal’s. The English was only faintly 
odd — a touch too precise, as if the 
speaker had to concentrate on it The 
face was as Raise had heard them des- 
cribed — smooth, light-skinned, with 
very pale gray eyes and traces of pa- 
per-white eyebrows. The Eje was seat- 
ed beside the hospital bed, so Raise 
couldn’t judge his height, but the 
shoulders were wide and thin from 
front to back. The mouth was tWn- 
lipped and broad, the ears small and 
round. The teeth were as even as 
Raise’s. All in all, the face suggested 
a subtly deformed man who was al- 
most an albino and who suffered from 
a slight facial paralysis. 

Something elusive was bothering 
Raise. He grasped it, suddenly tried 
to sit up. “Kimel My son!” 

“Your son is convalescing rapid- 
ly.” 

Raise lay back with a tired ex- 
halation and let the new pains in his 
chest subside. He hesitated, fearful 
of the answer to his next question. 
“Is he ... a . .?” 

The Eje — or Eje servant — 
smiled a minimal smile. “He is still a 
Normal. He needed bone surgery and 
tissue grafts in both thighs and deli- 


cate work on his spine and internal 
organs. He may limp for a year or 
so.” 

“Oh.” Raise closed his eyes and 
waited for the emotion to let go of 
his throat. No need to ask about his 
own body. It was the same one — 
the pains where he’d been shot told 
him that. After a while he asked, 
“Far End?” 

“Yes. In these circumstances we 
thought it necessary to bring you far 
from Sol. Do not worry about your 
organization. We have told Nat 
Glover that you and Kime are safe. 
And we lent him enough of the metal 
you use for coin so that he is not 
bankrupt. He has surrendered one of 
the tools. What remains now is for 
you to help us recover the other 
four.” 

Raise stared at the alien. “Tools?** 

The small smile returned. ‘Tools, 
or weapons, according to the use. 
They are the devices .with which we 
keep injured people alive until they 
can be brought here or to Pluto. We 
were so using them when Pank Sun- 
ner ambushed one of our ships and 
stole them.” 

R aise lay pondering glumly. He 
and Kime were captives, appar- 
ently, How could he defy them now? 
Must he try? 

The same old question. 

The being beside him must have 
guessed his thoughts. “Maybe you 
will trust us when you know more 
about us. Raise Bukanan. We have 
decided we must rely upon your dis- 
cretion. We would have to reveal 
the truth to a few subbs eventually, 
in any case. You think of us, you

humans, as a race with vast power, 
who may enslave you or who may 
continue to be mysterious and be- 
nevolent. It is not so." The being 
watched Raise for a minute. **We are 
not a race. Those of us who built the 
Beam and the hospitals, and who 
maintain them, are only a . what 
is an English word? An echo? A re- 
mainder? There are only a few of 
us — and that is why you see so 
little of us. There is another reason, 
of course. We are not yet ready to 
let Mankind know how few we are. 
We have machines, yes, and control 
great forces. But those are mere 
tools.” The being touched his own 
chest. “You understand, this is a subb 
body too.” 

“I supposed it was.” 

“It is. When I first wore it, the 
color was as yours, and the face and 
voice were as awkward. I have worn 
it for more than thirty thousand of 
your Terran years. For nearly all that 
time, I was in stasis. Recendy, when 
our probes disoovered an advanced 
biped race — yours I was brought 
out of stasis, along with the rest, to 
construct the Beam and the hospitali^. 
Now do you know. Raise Bukanan, 
how the tool you used operates?” 
Raise tried to make his thoughts 
stop whirling. “Stasis . 

The Eje smiled again. “I will try 
to put it in simple terms. 1 have re- 
hearsed so often, in my mind . 
there is a condition or realm which 
I will call Non-Time. That which 
is in it, has no motion, not even of 
atomic particles nor of energies. 
Therefore, it does not exist in the 
Space we call normal. Perhaps it is 
better to say it does not exist in 


normal Time. Does that make sense? 

“The tools are made for trans^ 
ferring an object into that condition 
of Non-Time. They will woric upon 
any coherent mass, within certain lim- 
its of size and consistency. 

“An object transferr^ to Non- 
Time is as suddenly prominent there 
as a nova in your sky. We have only 
to be near enough to see it and 
reach it. Yes, there are ways we can 
move about in Non-Time. That does 
not constitute time-travel in normal 
space; you comprehend? And since 
Time and Space do move, we can 
not tell instantly where we are when 
we go to a new object in Non- 
Time.” The Eje frowned delicately. 
“I am too involved. In essence, when 
something appears in Non-Time — 
an injured spaceman, for instance, 
put there by one of our tools — we 
may see it and reach it in time. 
Emergency treatment can be given 
while we travel in Non-Time to one 
of the hospitals. That is how you 
have survived twice now.” 

Raise struggled with the concepts. 
“I . tested one of the things on a 
cargo pod. It seemed to disappear. 
Then . .” 

“Of course. It went into Non-Time. 
We were not far away, but by the 
time we spaced out, you were escap- 
ing. Later, when you used the tool 
aboard Cetus, you put the whole 
ship into Non-Time, so that nothing 
moved before we arrived. Distances, 
by the way, are much shrunken in 
Non-Time. Do you understand?” 

“I begin to.” Raise lay thinking 
for a while. “I suppose I may as well 
just ask bluntly what your intentions 
are toward my race.” 


52 


IF 



44Tntentions?” The Eje sighed. “I 
JLdo not think the word is right. 
Consider, Raise Bukanan. If you were 
the last of your race, and you found 
another very much like it — but 
younger — what would your ‘inten- 
tions* be?” 

Raise floundered mentally. “Why, 
I’d teach them, I guess. Guide them, 
help them, if I could. Or maybe I’d 
just watch for a while. I guess I 
wouldn’t really have ‘intentions.’ Is 
that what you mean?” 

“That is what I mean. We have 
hopes. But you are, after all, not 
our race. Our race is dead. Raise 
Bukanan. We do not want to go to 
our own individual deaths feeling 
that our history, our accomplishments 
— even our crimes — will be for- 
gotten by the universe, will vanish as 
if we had never existed. You are 
much like ourselves: your arts, your 
laughter, your tragedies. We make it 
possible for you to reach the part 
of the galaxy where we once lived. 
You will find our ruins, when you 
spread farther from Far End.” The 
being sat brooding for a while. “We 
do not try to offer you wisdom. 
That, perhaps, you may learn from 
our history, as you dig it out. We 
offer only the opportunity. Especial- 
ly to you subbs we offer that.” 

Raise said, “But you have such 
science! How could your race — ” 
“How did it die? A question. Some 
say we let too many of our weaklings 
survive, through our medicine. Some 
say we did not weed out our savages. 
Perhaps it was neither — there may 
be a natural senescence of races. In 
any. case, we bred ourselves back to 
the jungle. Not a physical jungle — 


a jungle of the soul. It is as well 
that we became sterile. We had be- 
come a blight upon Nature. Perhaps 
Nature is sentient and acted.” 

A thought stirred in Raise. “Then 
you few who remain — you are not 
sterile because — and you say that 
you’ve changed.” 

The Eje smiled. “When I was 
brought out of stasis, I began to 
change. This is the lifeline of a subb. 
Raise Bukanan. At first you are 
brown and identical, without facial 
expression and with poor voices. 
Gradually, each individual regenerates 
to his original self. The original body 
is gone, but the brain remembers. 
You see me part way along the pro- 
cess which you yourself will undergo. 
I will be my original self again in 
fifty years or a hundred. Then I will 
age and die normally, as if I had 
never been a subb. I will never be 
fertile, but not because I have been a 
subb. There is no fertility in any of 
us. But you . • 

Raise sighed. “How long? How 
long?” 

“We do not know the time-sched- 
ule of a human subK Raise Bukanan. 
It may be two centuries, your time, 
before you are once again ready to 
age and die. In the meantime, you 
and the others will be the nearest 
thing to Caretakers the human race 
has. We will be gone. There are no 
more of us in stasis — we’ve gambled 
on you. We are tired of the search, 
of the memories that slept in our 
brains thirty thousand years and now 
seem fresh though we know they are 
not. The few of us who were awake 
in relays, through the long milleniums, 
were always gjad to be relieved, and

to die. They did not enjoy watching 
the mins of our ra9e crumble and 
disappear into the soil. And now / 
am happy that, soon, human subbs 
will be handed the responsibility.” The 
being got to his feet. “You need 
sleep. But first I would like your de- 
cision. Will you help us recover the 
other four tools? We are not ready 
yet to let Mankind have them; we 
must watch a little longer. We can 
find them without your help. But 
that would involve trouble for your 
organization, and bloodshed.” 

Raise held out a moment longer. 
“Did you kill Ernesto Vasquez?” 

“Of course not. Pank Sunner did.” 
Raise sighed. “I’ll help. And co- 
operate with you in every other way 
I can.” 

B eam Tramps leaving Lenare’s at- 

mosphere, accelerated toward 

FTL. Raise sat with Lee White in 
Aux Control, watching the blue-green 
planet recede. 

Lee said, “They seemed like a 
real happy bride and groom. Raise. 
Too bad you had to attend incogni- 
to.” 

Raise said, “It’ll be a while before 
he’s ready to hear that his father’s a 
subb. I’m trying to think how to 
keep it from him a while. He doesn’t 
know exacdy what happened aboard 
Cetus, but he’s thinking hard. Nat 
told him the subb who came to see 
Sunner wasn’t badly hurt and is out 
somewhere near Far End.” 

Lee asked, “Has it come to you. 
Raise, that you’ll live to see the two 
of them get old and die? And their 
kids, and their kids?” 


“It’s come to me.” Raise thought 
back to the wedding. With what un- 
thinking raptness young people said, 
“Forever,” 

Lee was sUent a while, with his 
own thoughts. Then he asked, “Where 
we going now?” 

“First, I have to go see General 
Nalty and explain enough to con- 
vince him Pank Sunner killed Ernes- 
to Vasquez. I’m not going to mention 
the Eje, or any of that, of course. 
I’ll just talk about the kidnapping and 
contraband. I think I can give him a 
good story. Then we’re going out to 
the Cloud. We’ll be reorganizing the 
Cluster.” 

“We going to kill the fertility pro- 
ject?” 

“Not for a while. It would be too 
hard to explain to the younger subbs. 
We can shift the emphasis gradually 
toward speeding up our regeneration. 
The Eje will help, I think.” 

Lee said, “Whether we can speed 
it up or not, it’s going to be a long 
wait. If you don’t object. I’m going 
to bring a mirror aboard and look 
in it every few hours. And as soon 
as I’m able. I’ll stand in front of it 
and laugh like a fool. I’ll laugh my- 
self sick. Raise. Think of it! We’ll 
be able to laugh again!” 

Raise said, “You’d better bring a 
dozen mirrors aboard. We’ll all be 
looking in them from now on.” 

He wondered, though, whether, by 
the time they could lau^ again, 
there’d be much laughter left in them.

NEW CURRENTS IN FANDOM 

by LIN CARTER 


Our Man in Fandom shows us 
some New Fandoms — and a 
fribufe fo a /afe, grdaf man! 


W HILE walking around during 
Nycon 3, meeting and talking 
with old friend and making new 
ones» 1 heard of some interesting new 
developments, ideas and projects now 
stirring in the ferment of science-fic- 
tion fa^om, which I thought 1 would 
pass along to you. 

The first of these is the fan 
achievement awards. Now, as you 
know, every year the annual conven- 
tion hands out a number of science 
fiction achievement awards in vary- 
ing categories, called **Hugoes.’* 
These awards, while they differ from 
one convention to another, because 
each Worldcon is organized by a dif- 
ferent fanclub made up of a differ- 
ent group of people, who often have 
some new ideas on convention-host- 
ing, generally follow a basic sys- 
tem of awarc^g the best science-fic- 
tion novel, novelette, short story, pro- 


zine, fanzine and professional artist 
of the past year. (But sometimes 
somebody comes up with an exciting 
new idea, like — 

The Pongs 

This year, the Nycon was sponsor- 
ed by New York City’s liveliest fan- 
club, the Fanoclasts, and the co- 
chaimen were Ted White and Dave 
Van Amam. Ted came up with some 
new ideas on the achievement awards: 
why just give one award to a fan 
(that is, for the best fanzine for the 
year)? If you’re going to include an 
award to Best Fanzine to stand be- 
side the award to Best Prozine, 
then why not have a Best Fan Writer 
and Best Fan Artist to set beside 
comparable professional classifica- 
tions? 

Now the professional science-fic- 


55 


tion achievement awards are called 
the Hugo Awards — named in honor 
of Hugo Gemsback, the great pio- 
neer of science fiction and founder 
of the first sf magazine. Why not 
name the fan achievement awards 
after some famous fan celebrity? He 
proposed to call these fan awards 
Pongs, after the well-known fannish 
pseudonym used by old-time fan 
Bob Tucker, who used to write hi- 
larious lampoons of fandom, pre- 
tending to be a Chinese fan named 
Hoy Ping Pong. 

Well, this idea didn’t sit too well 
with a lot of people in fandom, and 
the Pongs came in for so much di- 
verse criticism that the convention 
committee decided to drop the con- 
troversial nickname of Pong, and to 
award the Best Fan Artist and Writ- 
er with the traditional Hugoes. 

Still ... it sounded like a good 
idea to a lot of people, including this 
writer, and maybe a later convention 
will revive the notion. Ted’s sugges- 
tion was influential at least in estab- 
lishing the idea of giving annual 
achievement awards for fan writer 
and artist, and also set the innova- 
tion by having a Fan Guest of Honor 
at this year’s Nycon 3, namely Bob 
Tucker himself. So maybe the idea 
of parallel achievement awards for 
members of the fan ranks will catch 
on after all. 

Pulp Magozine Fandom 

As always happens at the World- 
con, the most interesting things that 
happen are the people you meet and 
talk with. For example, 1 ran into 
a fascinating chap named Fred S. 

56 


Cook from Sylvania, Ohio, who came 
up and introduced himself to me be- 
cause he knows 1 am a great fan and 
booster of the wonderful old Doc 
Savage novels originally issued by 
Street & Smith in the old pulps, now 
coming back in print from Bantam 
Books. 

Fred is a great Doc Savage fan 
and has begun publishing a new 
fanzine called Bronze Shadows for 
enthusiasts of pulp magazine super- 
heroes. (I say he’s just “begun” pub- 
lishing Bronze Shadows, . actu- 
ally the magazine is going strong, 
and he gave me a copy of the latest 
issue, which is the eleventh!) This 
excellent fanzine is loaded with in- 
teresting articles on the golden age 
of the pulps. For example, in No. 
11 is a complete checklist of the 
titles of novels which ran in The 
Phantom Detective magazine from 
1933 to 1953, when it went under. 

Also in the same issue is Part 10 
of an exhaustive critical analysis of 
the Doc Savage novels by Herman 
S. MacS^gar and a rare reprint 
of a fascinating article on the pulp 
fiction “master-plot” written by Les- 
ter Dent, who created Doc Savage 
under the pen name of Kenneth Rob- 
son. This article was originally writ- 
ten for a writers’ magazine back in 
1939, and few Doc Savage fans even 
knew of its existence until Fred Cook 
dug it up and reprinted it. 

Fred hopes the magazine will serve 
to enlist a sufficient number of old- 
time pulp fans, so that he can start a 
club going. This would make another 
of those “Little Fandoms Inside Fan- 
dom” I talked about in this column 
back in 1966 and 1967. 

IP 



Weird Horror Fans Unitel 

Another interesting new movement 
in fan circles today is the revival of 
interest in horror fiction which has 
stimulated all sorts of fanzines and 
brochures and new clubs into exist- 
ence. Take for example the excellent 
and very professional-looking fan 
publication, Anubis, edited by Paul 
J. Willis. Anubis is devoted to the 
literature of the macabre and the 
terrifying, and the magazine is loaded 
with interesting bits of verse and fic- 
tion plus handsome art and items of 
Lovecraftian scholarship. The latest 
issue I have seen. No. 2, for exam- 
ple, features some sample pages from 
The Necronomicon, ^at imaginary 
book H. P. Lovecraft was always 
quoting from in his famous horror 
tales. 

If the loathsome and the horrific 
is your meat, you may be interested 
to learn there is now a club-full of 
fans interested in the same fare. It’s 
recently been launched under the 
name of the National Horror and Fan- 
tasy Association (or “the NHFFA,” 
for short). I met a chap at the 
Worldcon named Fred Phillips, who 
tells me the club is now going strong, 
meets irregularly and has over 50 
members. If the NHFFA gets go- 
ing with enough members so they 
reach the point they can put on a 
horror-fans’ convention of their own 
like the Nycon, they could call it 
“the Necronomi-Con.” 

The Honnes Bok Memorial 

I 

One of the most interesting new 
friends 1 made at the Worldcon is 


EmU Petaja of San Francisco, the 
popular author of a number of ex- 
citing science-fantasy adventure nov- 
els and one of the closest friends 
of the late fantasy artist, Hannes 
Bok. Bok was one of the greatest 
geniuses of illustration ever to enter 
the fantasy or science-fiction field, 
and his death in 1964 was a tremen- 
dous loss. Emil and others among 
Bok’s friends have created an or- 
ganization called The Bokanalia 
Foundation as a sort of memorial 
to his magnificent talent; they are 
striving to keep his memory (and 
his work) alive through the Foundai- 
tion’s efforts in publishing and dis^ 
tributing his gorgeous drawings and 
paintings in excellent portfolios of 
well-printed reproductions. 

I have a copy of the first folio, 
and it contains 15 black and white 
drawings, size 9”xl2”, superbly and 
beautifully produced on heavy 
stock, just right for framing to hang 
in your library or den. Folio No. 2 
also offers 15 full-page drawings, in- 
cluding six which have never been 
published anywhere, plus a brilliant 
Remembrance of Hannes Bok by 
Ray Bradbury. The third folio has 
12 more prints of Bok’s work, in- 
cluding five new ones never in print 
in any form. 

. The Bokanalia Foundation also 
"has (called “Special A”) an origi- 
nal color painting of Hannes Bok’s, 
unpublished and previously unknown, 
reproduced on heavy stock in an 
edition limited to 100 copies, and 
“Special B” which is a magical Man- 
dala, or occult talisman representing 
“good swirling into evil, evil swirling 
into good.’’ Bok was something of a

mystic and a lifelong adherent to as- 
trology. And coming up soon is a 
fifty-page Biography of Hannes Bok 
written by his many friends and illus- 
trated with unpublished d^etches tak- 
en from his letters and notebooks. 
The Biography will include photo- 
graphs of Bok» pungent excerpts 
from his letters, and the first bibli- 
ography of bis published work ever 
compiled. This Biography is only 
one of several exciting new projects 
the Foundation is currently working 
on. 

This is a worthy cause, and a 
beautiful memorial: to one of the 
wisest and finest men ever. Contact

Anyone for a Tournament? 

But the wackiest and most curious 
of all these new fannish currents, is 
the rising craze for (of all things!) 
medieval tournaments. That’s right, 
gang, real tournaments, with jon- 
gleurs, costumes, medieval music 
played on ancient instruments of 
reasonable facsimiles thereof, fea- 
turing samples of food and drink 
from the Middle Ages and knightly 
contests of arms and all like that 
there. 

I suspect this new Thing sweeping 
through fandom is a sort of echo 
or by-blow of the enormous interest 
in J. R. R. Tolkien’s Lord of the 
Rings, which seems to have sparked 
a revival of enthusiasm for medie- 
val art, literature, customs and Me- 
dievalism in general. An 5 rway, fans 
on the West Coast are going whole 
hog for Tournaments now, and 

58 


remember, you read it here first. 

At this year’s Westercon, a re- 
gional conference held every July 
Fourth weekend at a different town 
in the West (usu^y in California), 
they had a fi^-fledged Tournament, 
by golly, where if you wanted to play 
music, you had to leave your guitar 
at home and drum up a lute or some- 
thing. People went so far as to avoid 
modem dress, wherever possible, al- 
though 1 believe you could wear 
glasses if needs thou must. 

The guiding hand in all this is a 
group called The Society for Con- 
temporary Anachronisms. They go 
to vast lengths to serve snacks from 
the Dark Ages and to make cer- 
tain nobody is (shudder!) wearing 
zippers, or other such 'Inventions of 
the Devil. Actually, the whole thing 
is for fun and not so deadly serious 
as 1 am describing it, and it sounds 
kind of cute. 

It might seem to elaborate and 
contrived and difficult and expensive 
to catch on all across the fannish 
world, and perhaps it is, but anyway 
those of you who plan to attend the 
1968 Baycon — the 26th World 
Science Fiction Convention, to be 
held over the Labor Day weekend at 
the Hotel Claremont in the Oakland/ 
Berkeley area in California, will have 
a chance to see just what a real fan- 
nish Tournament is all about. 

The Baycon will convene on Fri- 
day, August 30th, and will go on its 
merry way until at least Monday, 
September 2nd, and on Monday 
afternoon, at 3:30 P.M., right after 
the usual, traditional Auction, the 
Medieval Tournament will be held 
under the stem hand of Dave Thew- 

IF 



lis. Tournament Master, with live 
music furnished by the Concertium 
del Arte. 

All participants are asked to wear 
medieval garments. There will be 
broadsword duels, fencing matches, 
and the gore of combat will stain 
the hotel’s greensward with reeking 
crimson (well, not really, but it 
sounds better that way • . actually. 


these are mock duels in slow-motion.) 
The Baycon invites you to come arm- 
ed to defend your honor and to fight 
for your lady’s favor. Doubtless there 
will be prizes given to various cate- 
gories such as most convincing and 
authentic costume, etc. 

So, remember, if you’re coming 
to the Baycon in 1968, don’t leave 
your broadsword at home. END

R ight there on his right shoulder, job approximately 270 light-years re- 
like a general, Orion wears a moved from Earth, with a surface 
star. (He wears another in his left temperature of around 5,500 degrees 
armpit; but, for the sake of whole- Fahrenheit; and if you’d looked close- 
some similies, forget it.) ly, through one of those little glass 

Magnitude 0.7 as seen from the tents, you’d have seen that there was 
Earth,- with an absolute magnitude some titanium oxide present.

supergiant of an insignia; a class M pride that General Orion wore the

thing, because it had left the main 
sequence so long ago and because it 
was such a very, very big star, and 
because the nodlitary mind is like 
that. 

Betelguese, that’s the name of the 
star. 

Now, once upon a time, circling 
at a great distance about that mon- 
strous red pride of Orion, moving 
through a year much longer than a 
human lifetime, there was a dirty, 
dead hunk of rock that hardly any- 
one cared to dignify to the extent of 
calling it a world. Hardly anyone, I 
say. Governments move and think in 
strange ways, though. Take Earth 
for an example . 

It was decided whenever they 
don’t want to blame a particular per- 
son big organizations tend to get all 
objective and throw “it” around like 
mad — it was decided that because 
of the shortage of useful worlds, may- 
be that hunk of rock could be made 
to pay off somehow. 

So they got in touch with Francis 
Sandow and asked him if it could be 
done, and he told them, “Yes.” 

Then they asked him how much it 
would cost, and he told them that 
too, and they threw up their hands, 
then reached to close their briefcases. 

But, aside from being the only hu- 
man worldscraper in the business, 
Sandow did not become one of the 
wealthiest men around because of in- 
heritance or luck. He made them a 
proposal, and they bought it, and 
that’s how Dismal was born. 

N ow let me tell you about Dismal, 
the only habitable world in the 
Betelgeuse system. 


A scant improvement over the baie 
hunk of rock, that’s Dismal. Sandow 
forced an atmosphere upon it, 
against its dead will, an atmosphere 
full of ammonia and methane. Then 
he did brightening things to it, in- 
volving hydrogen and carbon; and the 
storms began. He had a way of ac- 
celerating things, and Earth’s physir 
cists warned him that if he di^’t 
watch it, he’d have an asteroid belt 
on his hands. He told them, I under- 
stand, that if that happened, he*d put 
them back together again and start 
over — but that it wouldn’t happen. 

He was right of course. 

When the storms subsided, he had 
seas. Then he stoked the world’s in- 
terior, and amidst cataclysms he 
shaped the land masses. He did var- 
ious things to the land and the 
seas, purged the atmosphere, turned 
off the Krakatoas, calmed the earth- 
quakes. Then he imported and nn>- 
tated plants and animals that grew and 
bred like mad, gave them a few years, 
tampered again with the atmosphere, 
gave them a few more, tampered 
again, and so on — maybe a dozen 
times. Then he set about screwing up 
the weather. 

Then one day, he took some offi- 
cials down to the surface of the 
world, whipped off his oxygen hel- 
met, raised an umbrella above him, 
took a deep breath and said, “This 
is good. Pay me,” before he started 
coughing. 

And they agreed that it was good, 
and this diing was done, and the 
government was happy for a time. 
So was Sandow. 

Why was everybody happy, for a 
time? Because Sandow had made

whicb Was what they’d both wanted, 
for v^ous reasons, that’s why. 

Why only for a time? There’s the 
rub, as you’ll see by and by. 

On most habitable worlds, there 
are some places that are somewhat 
pleasant. There are some small islands 
of relief from bitter winters, stifling 
summers, hurricanes, hail, tidal waves, 
terrific electrical storms, mosquitos, 
mud, ice, and all the rest of those 
little things that have prompted phil- 
osophers to concede that life is not 
without a certain measure of misery. 

Not so Dismal. 

You’d hardly ever see Betelgeuse, 
beckuse of the cloud cover; and when 
you did see it you’d wish you didn’t, 
because of the heat. Deserts, ice- 
fields knd jungles, perpetual storms, 
temperature extremes and bad winds 
— you faced various combinations 
of these wherever you went on Dis- 
mal, 'Which is the reason for its 
name. There was no island of relief, 
no that was pleasant. 

had Earth hired Sandow to 
create this hell? 

Well, criminals must be rehabili- 
tated; panted. But there has always 
been a certain punitive tenor to the 
thing, also. A convicted felon is pres- 
ently granted a certain measure of 
distas^ul experience along with his 
therapy, to make it stick — I guess — 
to the hide as well as the psyche. 

D ismal was a prison world. 

Five years was the maximum 
sentence on Dismal. Mine was three. 
De^Mte everything I’ve just said, you 
could get used to the place. I mean, 
the housing was good — air-condi- 


tioned or well insulated and heated, 
as necessary — and you were free to 
come and go as you would; you were 
welcome to bring your family along, 
or acquire one; and you could even 
make money. There were plenty jobs 
available, and there were stores, thea- 
ters, churches and just about any- 
thing else you could find on any oth- 
er world, though a lot sturdier in 
structure and often even underground. 
Or you could just sit around and 
brood if you wanted. You’d still be 
fed. The only difference between Dis- 
mal and any other world was that 
you couldn’t leave until your sentence 
was up. There were approximately 
three hundred thousand persons on 
the entire planet, of which probably 
ninety-seven percent were prisoners 
and their families. I didn’t have a 
family, but that’s beside the point. Or 
maybe it isn’t. I don’t know. I was 
part of one once. 

There was a garden where I work- 
ed, all alone except for the robots. 
It was half underwater all the time 
and all underwater half the time. It 
was down in a valley, high trees on 
the crests of the hills above, and I 
lived there in a shiny watertight quon- 
set with a small lab and a computer, 
and I’d go out barefoot and in shorts 
or in underwater gear, depending on 
the time, and I’d random harvest my 
crops or reseed the garden, and I 
hated it at first. 

In the morning it would some- 
times look as if the world had gone 
away and I was adrift in Limbo. Then 
the emptiness would resolve itself in- 
to simple fog, then into reptiles of 
mist which would slither away and 
leave me with another day. Like I

said, I hated it at first; but like I 
also said, you could get used to the 
place. I did, maybe because 1 got 
interested in my project. 

That’s why I diii’t give a damn 
about the cry, “Iron!” when I heard 
it, partly. 

I had a project. 

Earth couldn’t — strike that — 
wouldn’t pay Sandow’s rates when it 
came to building them a world miser- 
able enough to serve either as a pris- 
on or a basic training site for the 
military. So Sandow made his pro- 
posal, and that was what decided 
the destiny of Dismal. He gave them 
a cut rate and guaranteed plenty of 
therapeutic employment. He controll- 
ed so many of the industries, you 
see. 

Laboratories are all right, I guess, 
for just simply testing equipment. 
You get all sorts of interesting figures 
concerning stress limits, temperature 
resistance, things like that. Then you 
turn a product loose in the field, and 
something you hadn’t thought to test 
for goes wrong. I guess Sandow had 
had this happen to him lots of times, 
which is why he’d decided to pick 
up a piece of the field and add it to 
his lab facilities. 

Dismal, all full of vicissitudes, was 
the testing ground for countless 
things. Some guys just drove vehicles 
back and forth through different 
climate belts, listing everything that 
went wrong. All the fancy, sturdy 
dwellings I mentioned were test- 
items also, and their counterparts will 
doubtless one day spring up on other 
worlds. You name it, and somebody 
was living with it on Dismal. Mine 
was food. 


A nd one day there came the ery, 
“Iron!” I ignored it, of coufse. 
I’d heard the rumors, back before 
I’d asked to serve out my sentence 
on Dismal, even. 

My sentence had been up almest a 
year before, but I’d stayed on. I couM 
leave any time I wanted, but I ^dn’t 
There h^ been something I’d wanted 
to prove, I guess, and then Td got- 
ten wrapped up in the project. 

Francis Sandow had been testing 
lots of things on Dismal, but sc far 
as I was concerned the most interest- 
ing was a by-product of the local 
ecology. There was something pe- 
culiar to my valley, something that 
made rice grow so fast you. could 
see it growing. In the hi^er, dikr 
places, it did the same with other 
grains. Just in my valley, thouf^ 
Sandow himself didn’t know what it 
was, and the project for which Td 
volunteered was one designed to find 
out. If there was anything odBile 
that could be ready for harvest two 
weeks after it was planted, it repre- 
sented such a boon to the growfa^i 
population of the galaxy that its se- 
cret was worth almost any price. Sel 
went armed against the serpents and 
the water-tigers; I harvested, analyzed, 
fed the computer. The facts aceuwo- 
lated dowly, over the years, as I 
tested first one thing, then another; 
and I was within a couple harvests 
of having an answer, I feh, when 
someone yelled, “Iron!” Nuts! 

I’d half-dismissed what it was that 
I’d wanted to prove as unprovahte, 
and all I wanted to do at that mo- 
ment of time was to come up with 
the final answer, turn it over to the 
universe and say, “Here I’ve done

something to pay back for what I’ve 
tatken. Let’s it square, huh?” 

On one of the infrequent occa- 
sions when I went into the town, 
that was all they were talking about» 
thb iron. 1 didn’t like them too much 
— people, I mean — which was why 
I’d initially requested a project 
where I could work alone. They were 
speculating as to whether there’d be 
an exodus, and a couple comments 
wefe made about people like me be- 
ing able to leave whenever they want- 
ed. I didn’t answer them, of course. 
My therapist, who hadn’t wanted 
me to take a job off by myself, all 
alone, also didn’t want me being bel- 
ligerant and argumentative, and I’d 
followed her advice. Once my sen- 
tence was up. I stopped seeing her. 

I Was surprised therefore, when the 
visitor-bell rang and I opened the 
door and she almost fell in, a forty- 
mile wind at her back and^wet ma- 
chine-gun fire from the heavens straf- 
ing her, to boot. 

4 4Qusan! . Come in,” I said. 

^ “I guess I already am,” she 
said, and I closed the door behind her. 
“Let me hang your stuff up.” 
“Thanks,” and I helped her out of 
a thing that felt like a dead eel and 
hung it on a peg in the hallway. 

“Would you care for a cup of 
coffee?” 

“Yes.” 

She followed me into the lab, 
which also doubles as a kitchen. 

“Do you listen to your radio?” she 
asked, as I presented her with a cup. 

“No. It went out on me around a 
month ago, and I never bothered fix- 
ing it.” ” 


“Well, it’s official,” she said. 
“We’re piilling out.” 

I studied her wet red bangs and 
gray eyes beneath matching brows 
and remembered what she’d told me 
about transference back when I was 
her patient. 

“I’m still transferring,” I said, to 
see her blush behind the freckles; 
and then, “when?” 

“Beginning the day after tomor- 
row,” she said, losing the blush rap- 
idly. “They’re rushing ships from all 
over.” 

“I see.” 

“ ... So I thought you’d better 
know. The sooner you register at the 
port, the earlier the passage you’ll 
probably be assigned.” 

I sipped my coffee. 

“Thanks, Any idea how long?” 
“Two to six weeks is the estimate.” 
“ ‘Rough guess’ is what you mean.” 
“Yes.” 

“Where’re they taking everybody?” 
“Local pokeys on thirty-two differ- 
ent worlds, for the time being. Of 
course, this wouldn’t apply to you.” 
I chuckled. 

“What’s funny?” 

“Life,” I said. “I’U bet Earth is 
mad at Sandow.” 

“They’re suing him for breach of 
contract. He’d warrantied the world, 
you know.” 

“I doubt this would be covered 
by the warranty. How could it?” 

She shrugged, then sipped her 
coffee. 

“I don’t know. All I know is what 
I hear. You’d better close up shop 
and go register, if you want to get 
out early.” 

“I don’t,” I said. “I’m getting near

to an answer. I’m going to finish the 
project^ I hope. Six weeks might do 
it” 

Her eyes widened, and she lowered 
the cup. 

‘That’s ridiculous!” she said. 
“What good will it be if you’re dead 
and nobody knows the answer you 
find?” 

“I’ll make it” I said, returning in 
my mind to the point I had one time 
wanted to prove. “I think I’ll make 
it?” 

She stood. 

“You get down there and register!” 

“That’s very direct therapy, isn’t 
it?” 

“I wished you’d stayed in therapy.” 

“I’m sane and stable now,” I said. 

“Maybe so. But if I have to say 
you’re not to get you probated and 
shipped off-world, I will!” 

I hit a button on the box on the 
table, waited perhaps three seconds, 
hit another. 

“ ... to say you’re not, to get you 
probated and shipped off-world, I 
will!” said the shrill, recorded voice 
behind the speaker. 

“Thanks,” I said. ‘Try it.” 

She sat down again. 

“Okay, you win. But what are you 
trying to prove?” 

I shrugged and drank coffee. 

“That everybody’s wrong but me,” 
I said, after a time. 

“It shouldn’t matter,” she said, 
“and if you were a mature adult it 
wouldn’t matter, either way. Alsoj I 
think youYe wrong.” 

“Get o^” I said softly. 

“I’ve listed to your addescent 
fantasies, over and over,” she said. 
“I know you. I’m beginning to think 


you’ve got an unnatural death-wish as 
well as that unresolved family proln 
lem we — ” 

1 laughed, because it was the only 
alternative to saying, “Get out” 
again, in a louder voice. 

“Okay,” I said. “I’ll agree with 
anything you say about me, but 1 
won’t do anything you tell me to do. 
So consider it a moral victory or 
something.” 

“When the time comes, yen’! 
run.” 

“Sure.” 

She returned to her coffee. 
“You’re really getting near to an 
answer?” she finally said. 

“Yes, I really am.” 

“I’m sorry that it had to happen, 
at just this time.” 

“I’m not,” I said. 

She looked about the lab, then out 
through the quartz windows at the 
slushy field beyond. 

“Hew can you be happy out here, 
all alone?” 

“I’m not,” I said, “But it’s better 
than being in town.” 

She shook her head, and I watched 
her hair. 

“You’re wrong. They don’t care 
as much as you think Aey do.” 

I filled my pipe and lit it 
“Marry me,” I said softly, “and 
I’ll build you a palace, and I’ll buy 
you a dress for every day of the year 
— no matter how long the years are 
in whatever system we pick.” 

She smiled then. 

“You mean that.” 

“Yes.” 

“Yet you stole, you . ” 

“Will you?”

*‘No, Thanks. You knew Fd say 
that.” 

“Yes.” 

Wc finished our coffee, and 1 saw 
her to the door and didn’t try to 
kiss her. Hell, I had a pipe in my 
mouthy and that’s what it was there 
for. 

I killed a forty-three foot water 
snake that afternoon, who had 
thought the shiny instrument 1 was 
carrying in my left hand looked aw- 
fully appetizing, as well as my left 
hand and the arm attached to it and 
the rest of me. I put three splints into 
him from my dart gun, and he died, 
thrashing around too much, so that 
he ruined some important things 1 
had growing. The robots kept right 
on about their business, and so did I, 
after that. I measured him later, 
which is how I know he was a forty- 
three-footer. Robots are nice to work 
with. They mind their own business, 
and they never have anything to say. 

I fixed the radio that night, but 
they were worried about iron on all 
frequencies, so 1 turned it off and 
smoked my pipe. If she had said ye^ 
you know, I would have done it. 

In the week that followed, I learn- 
ed that Sandow was diverting all of 
his commercial vessels in the area to 
aid in the evacuation, and he’d sent for 
others from further away. I could 
have guessed that without hearing it. 1 
could guess what they were saying 
about Sandow, the same things they 
always say about Sandow: here is a 
man who has lived so long that he’s 
afraid of his own shadow. Here is 
one of the wealthiest men in the 
galaxy, a paranoid, an hypochon- 


driac, holed-up on a fortress world 
all his own, going out only after tak- 
ing the most elaborate precautions 
— rich and powerful and a coward. 
He is talented beyond his own kind. 
God-like, he can build worlds and 
feature them and populate them as 
he would. But there is really only one 
thing that he loves: the life of Fran- 
cis Sandow. Statistics tell him that he 
should have died long ago, and he 
burns incense before the shrine of sta- 
tistics. I guess all legends have un- 
shined shoes. Too bad, they say that 
once he was quite a man. 

And that’s what they say when- 
ever his name comes up. 

T he evacuation was methodical and 
impressive. At the end of two 
weeks there were a quarter million 
people on Dismal. Then the big ships 
began to arrive, and at the end of 
the third week there were a hundred- 
fifty thousand remaining. The rest of 
the big vessels showed up then, and 
some of the first ones made it back 
for a second load. By the middle of 
the fourth week, there were seventy- 
five thousand, and by the end of it, 
there was hardly anybody left. Ve- 
hicles stood empty in the streets, tools 
lay where they had been dropped. 
Abandoned projects hummed and 
rumbled in the ^demess. The doors 
of all the shops were unlocked and 
merchandise still lay upon the coun- 
ters, filled the shelves. The local fauna 
grew restless, and I found myself 
shooting at something every day. Ve- 
hicle after vehicle tore at the air and 
sunk within the cloud-cover, trans- 
porting the waiting people to the big 
unseen vessels that circled the world.

Homes stood abandoned^ the remains 
of meals still upon their tables. All 
the churches had been hastily decon- 
secrated and their relics shipped o£f- 
woiid. We sampled day and night, 
the robots and I, and I analyzed and 
drank coffee and fed the data to the 
Computer and waited for it to give 
me the answer, but it didn’t. It al- 
ways seemed to need just another 
scintilla of information. 

Maybe I was crazy. My time was, 
technically, borrowed. But to be so 
close and then to see the whole 
thing go up in flames — it was 
worth the gamble. After all, it would 
take years to duplicate the setup I 
had there, assuming it could be du- 
plicated. The valley was, somehow, 
a freak, an accidental place that had 
occurred during millions of years of 
evedution compressed into a decade 
or so by a science I couldn’t even 
begin to understand. 1 worked and 
i waited. 

The visitor-bell rang. 

It wasn’t raining this time, in fact 
the cloud-cover showed signs of 
breaking up for the first time in 
months. But she blew in as though 
there was a storm at her back again, 
anyway. 

44Xrou’ve got to get out,” she 
Jl said. “It’s imminent! Any 
second now it could — ” 

1 slapped her. 

She covered her face and stood 
there and shook for a minute. 

“Okay, I was hysterical,” she said, 
“but it’s true.” 

“I realized that the first time you 
told me. Why are you still around?” 

“Don’t you know, damn you?” 


“Say it,” I said, listening attentively. 
“Because of you, of course! Come 
away!’ Now!” 

“I’ve almost got it,” I said. ‘To- 
night or tomorrow, possibly. I’m too 
close now to give up.” 

“You asked me to marry you,” 
she said. “All right, I will — if 
you’ll grab your toothbrush right now 
and get out of here.” 

“Maybe a week ago I would have 
said yes. No, now, though.” 

“The last ships are leaving. There 
are less than a hundred people on 
Dismal li^t now, and they’ll be gone 
before sundown. How will you get 
away after that, even if you decide to 
go?” 

“I won’t be forgotten,” I said. 

“No, that’s true.” She smiled, 
slightly, crookedly. “The last vessel 
will run a last-minute check. Their 
computer will match the list of the 
evacuees with the Dismal Directory. 
Your name will show up, and they’ll 
send a special search vessel down, 
just for yon. That’ll make you feel 
important, won’t it? Really wanted. 
Then the^ haul you away, whether 
you’re ready or not, and thafU be it.” 
“By then I might have the an- 
swer.” 

“And if not?” 

“We’U see.” 

I handed her my handerchief then 
and kissed her when she least ex- 
pected it — while she was blowing 
her nose — which made her stamp 
her foot and say an unladylike word. 

Then, “Okay. Til stay with you un- 
til they come for you,” she said. 
“Somebody’s got to look after you 
until a guardian can be appointed.” 
“I’ve got to check some seedlings

I shot two snakes and a water-tiger Iron. Well, it’s something you can’t

while I was out there, and pieces of away after its own fashion, 
bloody Betelgeuse began to show 
among them. The robots bore the 
carcasses away, and I didn’t stop to 
measure them this time. 

Susan watched me in the lab, 
keeping silent for almost an entire 
hour, until I told her, “Perhaps to- 
morrow’s sample ...” 

She looked .out through the win- 


F or ages upon ages, Orion’s insig- 
nia had burned hydrogen in its 
interior, converting -it to helium, ac- 
cumulating that helium. After a time 
the helium core began to contract, 
and the helium nuclei fused, formed 
carbon, produced the extra energy 
Orion had wanted to keep his uni- 
form looking snappy. Then, to keep 
up a good front when that trick be- 
gan to slip, he built up oxygen and 
neon from the carbon, increasing the 
temperature of the core. Afraid that 
would fail him, he moved on to mag- 
nesium and silicon. Then iron. Cer- 
tain spectroscopy techniques had let 
us see what was going on at the cen- 
ter. General Orion had used up aU 
his tricks but one. Now he h^d no 
recourse but to convert the iron back 
into helium by drawing upon the 
gravitational field of his star. This 
would require a rather drastic and 
rapid shrinking process. It would 
give him a blaze of glory all right, 
and then a white dwarf of an insig- 
nia to wear forevermore. Two hun- 
dred seventy years later the nova 
would become visible on Earth, and 
he’d still look pretty good for a little 
while, which I guess meant some- 
thing. The military mind is funny 
that .way. 

“Iron,” I repeated. 

They came for me the following 


68 



morning, two of them, but I wasn’t 
ready to go yet. They set their ship 
down on the hill to the north of me 
and disembarked. They wore deep- 
space gear, and the first one bore a 
rifle. The man behind him carried a 
“sniffer,” a machine that can track 
a man down on the basis of his per- 



sonal body-chemistry. It was effective 
for a range of about a mile. It in- 
dicated the direction of the quonset, 
because I was between them and it. 

I lowered my binoculars and wait- 
ed. I drew my splinter gun. Susan 
thought I was in the garden. Well, I 
had been. But the minute that thing 
came down and settled between the 
blaze and the mists, I headed toward 
it. I took cover at the end of the 
field and waited. 

I had my gear with me, in expec- 


tation of just such a visit. See, the 
B.O. machine can’t sniff you out un- 
der the water. 

They must have slowed when they 
lost the scent, but eventually I saw 
their shadows pass above me. 

I surfaced, there in the canal, push- 
ed back my mask, drew a be^ and 
said, “Stop! Drop the gun or I’ll 
shoot!” 

The man with the rifle turned 
quickly, raising it, and I shot him in 
the arm.

rifle fell to the trail and he 
clutched at his arm. “Now kick it

“Mister, you’ve got tb get out of

blow any minute I We came to get

“I know it. I’m not ready to go.” 

“You won’t be safe till you’re in 
hyperspace.” 

“I know that, too. Thanks for the 
advice, but I’m not taking it. Kick 
that damn rifle into the water! Now!” 

He did. 

“Okay, that’s better. If you’re so 
hot on takiifg someone back with you, 
there’s a girl named Susan Lennert 
down in the quonset. Her you can 
push around. Go get her and take her 
away with you. Forget about me.” 

The man holding his arm looked 
to the other who nodded. 

“She’s on the list,” he said. 

“What’s wrong with you, mister?” 
the first one asked. “We’re trying to 
save your life.” 

“I know it, I appreciate it. Don’t 
bother.” 

“Why?” 

“That’s my business. You’d better 
get moving.” I gestured toward Be- 
telguese with the barrel of my pistoL 

The second man licked his Ups, and 
the first one nodded. Then they turn- 
ed and headed toward the quonset. 
I followed all the way, since they 
were now unarmed and the garden 
pests weren’t 

She must have put up a fuss, be- 
cause they had to drag her off, be- 
tween them. I stayed out of sight, 
but I covered them all the way back 
to the ship and watched until it lift- 
ed off and vanished in the bright 
sky. 

Then I went inside, gathered up 
.the records, changed my clothes, 
went back outside and waited. 


Were my eyes playing tricks on 
me, or did Betelgeuse flicker for just 
a second Perhaps it was an atmos- 
pheric disturbance . 

A water-tiger broke the surface 
and cut a furrow straight toward me, 
where I stood upon the trail. I shot it, 
and a snake appeared from some- 
where and began eating it. Then two 
more snakes showed up, and there 
was a fight. I had to shoot one of 
them. 

Betelguese seemed to brighten 
above me, but apprehension could ac- 
count for that seeming. I stood right 
there and waited. Now my point 
would either be proved or disproved, 
once and for all time, so far as I 
was concerned; and, either way. I’d 
rest afterwards. 

It wasn’t until, much later that 
afternoon, as I drew bead upon a 
rearing water snake and heard his 
voice say, “Hold your fire,” and I 
did, that I realized just how petty I 
might have been. 

The snake slowly lowered its great 
bulk and slithered past me. 1 didn’t 
turn. I couldn’t It was so long and 
kept slithering by, and I kept won- 
dering, but I couldn’t turn around. 

Then a hand fell upon my shoul- 
der, and 1 had to; and there he was, 
and I felt about three inches tall as 
I stood there before him. 

The snake kept rubbing up against 
his boots and turning to do it again. 

CC T Tetio,” I said, and, ‘Tm sorry.” 

Xx He was smoking a dgar and 
was maybe five feet eight inches 
tall, with nondescript hair and dark 
eyes, when I finally brou^t myself 
to look into them. I’d almost forgot-

ten. It had been so long. 1 could 
never forget his voice, though. 

“Don’t be sorry. There’s no need. 
You had to prove something.” 

“Yes. She was ri^t, thou^ — : ” 
“Have you proven it?” 

“Yes. You’re not what they say 
you are, and you came here for one 
reason — me.” 

“That’s ri^t’’ 

*T shouldn’t have done it. 1 shouldn’t 
have expected it of you. 1 had to 
know, though, I just had to — but 
I shouldn’t have.” 

“Of course you should. Maybe I 
needed it, too, to prove it to my- 
self, as much as you needed to see 
it. There are some things that should 
mean more than life to a man. Did 
you find what you were looking for

“Days ago, sir.” 

“‘Sir’ isn’t what you used to call

And the snake followed after, and 
he wouldn’t turn it away. He brought 
it aboard, its bulk coiled about the 
cabin, and he took it along, out of 
that lopsided Eden. I’ll never forget 
that he did that, either. END

by BARRY ALAN WEISSAAAN 


Vve driven this road a hundred 
times — but why did you put 
this whole new country around if? 


44Tmagine if you will, or if you 
•I* can, a world in which Marco 
Polo did not discover the New World. 

**Oh, myl You still don’t under- 
stand; well, let me explain further. 

‘‘First, my Christian name is Som-, 
merfield, John (the Chinese call me 
by a different name, but to you, ap- 
parently, that is just a number of 
meanin^ess syllables). Pm a mer- 
chant in trinkets. You know, beads, 
diamonds, things of that sort Any- 
way, about one month ago, 1 decid^ 
to go on a trip down the new Straight- 


as-an-Arrow Roadway to Standish 
just across the British border.(Why, 
yes, that’s it On that big river where 
it meets the smaller one from the 
east. 1 see you have them labeled 
“Ohio” and “Miss Sippi”). I was go- 
ing to combine business with pleasure, 
as my sales representative there is a 
dunce, especially to handle the Royal 
contract upon which we are bidding. 
The pleasure was for my wives, as 
Numbers Four and Twelve had been 
pestering me about a vacation since a 
month after Twelve’s honeymoon. I 


72 





wouldn’t have given in to Four but 
Twelve — yes, that’s her, over there 
by that fellow in the blue uniform 
and big eyes — is still fairly new, and 
I was in a good humor. Yesterday we 
all bundled into the Chang Wagon 
and off we went. 

“Oh, yes, I’m terribly sorry. My 
home office is, of course, in Bay-of- 
Fires. Where? Oh, on the 
map. Now let me see. • • « Ah, 
yes, here it is. You have it labeled 
Son Deego. Now where was I? Yes, 
well, once we were past the Touch- 
the-Sky Mountains, everything went 
smoothly. I am, as you can see, un- 
fortunately of British stock, as you 
are yourselves, although I am now 
proudly a full citizen of the Empire 
(why, Chinese, of course!). These 
features naturally lead to occasional 
stops and inspections by army units. 
But they soon let us continue, after 
seeing my papers . including some 
of the folded red ones not in the offi- 
cial packet. After all, one must occa- 
sionally grease the wheels, and I am a 
businessman. 

“Now here, about where this 
map is marked Son Anthano, the 
first problems arose. I was driving, 
naturally, but it couldn’t have been 
more than an hour since the girls 
had folded our night pavillion back 
onto the roof, so I couldn’t have been 
very tired. Anyway, I suddenly no- 
ticed my vision blur for a moment, 
and then it cleared. But everything 
had changed. 

“The Emperor’s packed earth and 
granite road was no more. Instead 
we were traveling at an outrageous 
speed down a hard cement strip with 
painted lines on it. All the toiling

coolies, and their green fields, had 
surprisingly been suddenly replaced 
by brown dirt and brush. Both I and 
the girls were astonished. It was at 
this point that that fellow over there, 
the one in blue — ” 

(Let the record indicate that the

— came by on his little biwheel 
and literally forced us over to the 
side of the road. 

44T^espite his rudeness, I was go- 
jlJ ing to ask him to join us for 
tea, for I was anxious for information 
to explain my strange surroundings. 
But he didn’t give me a chance. 

‘“Where do you think you’re go- 
ing, Buddy?’ he rudely inquired, ‘to 
a fire?’ I immediately replied that I 
had not been informed of the calam- 
ity. Thinking that it must have been 
this fire which had destroyed the 
surrounding countryside, and that it 
must still be raging up ahead, I in- 
quired of him if I should make a 
detour, or if the assistance of myself

and my wives might be required or 
helpful at the front. 

“‘Wives?’ he asked, and then I 
think he noticed them for the first 
time. His eyes opened wide and his 
jaw dropped in quite a pronounced 
manner. Then he began to write in 
this little notebook which he had re- 
moved from his shirt pocket. He 
spoke to himself as he did this. 
‘Speeding — a hundred an’ fifty,’ and 
then scribbled something; and then 
he mumbled ‘Driving without regis- 
tration and — ’ he turned to me with 
— ‘you got a license?’ 

“I replied by displaying the green 
Pass-through-All issued personally to 
me by the Emperor’s Hand itself. 
But the fellow merely smiled and 
turned back to his notebook. ‘No 
License.’ And then, ‘driving an ex- 
perimental vehicle on a public high- 
way, and . bigamy?’ I nodded, 
thin^g that he realiz^ my station, 
and I added, smiling, ‘No, polygamy.’ 
Then coming closer, he looked in the 
window once more, smiling and nod- 
ding, ‘indecent exposure,’ as he con- 
tinued writing. This last comment 
rather riled me because 1 have al- 
ways prided my wives as the best- 
dressed in Bay-of-Fires — business- 
wise, you know. But 1 maintained my 
temper. 

“He finished his writing with a 
flourish and then said, ‘I should put 
down “Coming out without a keep- 
er,” but then they’d think that I 
was crazy.* He then turned and walk- 
ed back to his biwheel, removed a 
plastic doohicky attached by a wire 
cord to the vehicle, and talked to it 
for a time. After moving the biwheel 
off the road, he returned to me say- 


ing, ‘Move over, Pop. I’ll drive you 
in.’ I thanked trim for the courtesy, 
and slid over. He sat down, turned 
the magnetokey and started off — 
backwards. By the time he recovered 
sufficiently to stop my car, we were 
ten feet off the road and hub deep 
in dirt. The Changs, you know, make 
up for their speed and roominess by 
their added weight, and mine was 
well loaded. Number Seven ended up 
on my lap, and Number Ten was 
holding onto my neck in a most un- 
comfortable manner. I’m afraid 1 
lost my ^temper then. An Oriental 
wouldn’t have. I’m sure, but 1 am 
still a Caucasian and 1 have their 
weaknesses — and at this point my 
White patience reached its limit. 

“I’m afraid that I threw him phys- 
ically from my car. He landed near 
his own vehicle, shook his head and 
then smiled again. He again renaoved 
the notebook from his pocket and 
said as he scribbled, ‘assaulting an 
officer.* 

44 T meanwhile, got back into my 

A vehicle and had Number Five, 
who always acted as my secretary on 
these trips, take a letter which I dic- 
tated to the local Hand. 1 was too 
involved in this to notice what that 
rude fellow did for the next few 
minutes. 

“Eventually, others in uniform 
like his arrived and offered us trans- 
portation, which I gratefully accept- 
ed. Obviously to make up for their 
companion’s rudeness, they pr<Mnised 
to have my car repaired and returned 
to me. They then kindly gave us food 
and lodging, but refused us communi- 
cation with the local Hand. Although

they did promise to post my letter. 

“Yes, sir. They promised that you 
would take me to the Hand if I 
told you my story. Why, I assure you, 
sir, it is the absolute truth to the best 
of my knowledge. 

‘Tm afraid that I must now insist 
that you immediately take me to the 
Emperor’s Hand! This unwarranted 
delay weakens iny Occidental pa- 
tience, sir. I warn you! I know Lords 
in high places, some at the Emperor’s 
Court at Shangtu!”

formed and reminded that his fate is 
totally dependent on the mercy of

I 

W hen we fell away from the 
orbiting liner, I wondered if 
after all these years they had aban- 
doned the flyboy. But the shuttle- 
boat canted, and the pilot swung 
into a wide curve. Beside me, a ci- 
vilian blurted, “What the hell!” 

My reflex was to glare him down, 
but I stifled it. After all, how could 
this jerk know? I said, “Relax! Lo- 
cal custom. The timing is right for a 
swing past the Cenotaph.” He look- 
ed confused so I added, “It started 
when ' they ferried down the first 
colonists. You don’t have to sa- 
lute.” 

But I was going to — with a lit- 


tle extra snap for Henry Mercer, 
who had fought it as best he could, 
screaming with his eyes at what he 
was doing and what was being done 
to him. And who said, “Thanks, 
~ Steve!” when I shot him. 

^ The civilian frowned at the E 
on my collar and the initials on my 
bag. I looked out the port, feeling 
his eyes on the back of my neck. 
And presently I thought, there, you 
mega jerk! You could read it if you*d 
bother to look! Jasan MacKenzie, 
Henry Mercer, Walter Kirby. Three 
guys who died, buying that ship- 
load of colonists! 

He was blurting again. “Of 
course! The Cenotaph Satellite! 
There was an engineer, too, who 
nearly died. Lindsay! Frank Lindsay! 
And a Doctor, June Logan! And a 
pilot .... Holt .... now in your, 
in E-Service. And the C P . .” 

I felt a temper storm start to 
flicker. So! You've seen tapes! You

know the whole story! But the flick- 
er died when I felt my hand reach 
up and brush my shoulder. Yes, 
there was a Doctor Logan. She 
spotted that brush-off gesture before 
I did. She says I’m reminding my- 
self not to carry a chip on that 
shoulder. But in spite of the brush- 
off there was temper enough left to 
make me out off 'his question when 
he glanced again at the bag. 1 
growled, “Yes. There was the Com- 
mand Pilot, name of Mendes. Steve 
Mendes.” And don't judge me, jerk! 
You weren't there! 

1 don’t believe 1 said that out loud. 

I don’t much, any more. Little 
Doc Logan tells me I’m the only one 
who ever did do any judging and 
to cut it out! And the civilian blurt- 
ed on, friendly, well meaning, in- 
terested — not curious, there’s a dif- 
ference. Presently I brushed the 
shoulder again and leaned back, nod- 
ding. Okay, Mister. So maybe you 
aren’t a jerk. Not a mpgajerk any- 
wiaiy. But you’ll have to owe me 
that drink imtil tomorrow. I’ve a 
date tonight, and we don’t talk much 
even among ourselves, at first, on 
those rare times when we can get 
together. No need. We’re close, and 
for twenty-four niglhtmare hours we 
were closer than it’s safe for humans 
to be. 

But your mind covers up hor- 
ror, or else how could you live? 
I’m the only one with a residual 
touch of guilt. I took them blunder- 
ing into it. 

No help for that. Everybody, from 
the Coordinator of Colonization on 
down, shares the blame. Which 
CENOTAPH 


means, in effect, nobody. But once 
in, I might have gotten them out — 
all of them — if I hadn’t been 
wearing that chip. By the time I 
lost it, we had all started scream- 
ing. And I was standing over Henry 
Mercer, with a gun in my hand, and 
he was saying, “Thanks, Stevel” You 
know what it’s like, having a man 
thank you for that? 

So Okay you — proibably not a 

— jerk! & I growl because 1 see 
Henry Mercer’s eyes every time I 
skip down here. But wait until those 
wing retros stop flaring, so you can 
see, and look down! Would you 
pick Mora II as a setting for sun- 
lit nightmares? Well, neither did 
we. Our first view was the one you 
have now, that same frothy coast- 
line with the greenrbordered bays. 
That day the sun was low and gleam- 
ing and to the west the wind was 
sweeping with a mile-wide brush of 
feather nimbus, painting the sea 
a shimmering orange and spattering 
great splashes of gold bac^ over 
the green where the forest walks into 
the sand. Beautiful? As beautiful as 
it is now. Dangerous? What isn’t, 
if you’re careless. 

But I wasn’t careless. 1 had been 
in space five years, and I was still 
alive. Ergo, I wasn’t careless. But 
one of my shoulders was heavy, 
with brighit, new command bars and 
that chip. I was being watched. Ex- 
ploration Department — the fab- 
ulous, infallible, sacrosanct BIG-E 

— was looking over my shoulder. A 
crag-faced, cold-eyed captain, with 
the Big E on his collar, kept re- 
peating in one carefully tactful way 
after another, “Easy, Captain Men- 

77 



des. W© don’t yet iknow what hap- 
peined to MacKenzie!” 

Nuts! Jason MacKenzie was a 
ghosts a scratchy voice on a spool 
of wh©I 

So I took them in! And 1 didn’t 
get them out! 

Stih, for the [first hour, to eome 
out of that Eden was the last tiling 
we wanted. We touched down in 
a meadow that Jason MacKenzie*s 
ghost-vodce had described, and it 
matched his description, lush with 
low grass that smelled lilte new hay. 
We were laut^hing, all except crag- 
faced GOaptain Kiihy, and it was 
my belief he had never lauded. 
Ellen Hok and I were pacing off an 
area for a prefab and breathing in 
that strange, heady new-hay aroma, 
acting like kids on a picnic, whed 
the first of those sunlit naghtmares 
hit me. 

'T^heie was no warning, that time. 

X One minute 1 was pacing and 
counting and watching die swing of 
Ellen’s dancer’s walk beside me. The 
next, 1 was stretched out on the 
grass, aware Fd been in a bad 
dream and relieved it was only a 
dream. 1 was squitming, too, for 
big Frank Lindsay was putting his 
weight into an arm lock. 

I hadn’t been out long; the 6un| 
was still gleaming, and our meadow 
still locked liked Eden before the 
snake. But something facdess was 
lurking just under threshold of 
memory, scuttling back when I look- 
ed at it. Ever tense up at, well, **the 
quiet contemplation of beauty,” 
when something unwanted leer^ 
at you? You ask how the hell did 
78 


that get out and you push it back. 
1 pushed this faceless thing, what- 
ever it was, back and covered by 
growling, “Okay, Frank! Okay! I’ll 
need the arm!” 

Ellen Holt took the other arm 
and helped me up. That much, at 
least, 1 liked. But her indigo eyes 
were big, land she asked, “Steve, 
what happened?” 

I frowned at her and they ex- 
changed glances and she said, “You 
.... stopped counting and your 
face went blank and you started 
off toward that swamp area we saw 
coming down, north of us.” 

1 remembeied, then, and 1 asked, 
“How did you know where I was 
going?” 

Crag-faced Captain Kirby, rub- 
bing his jaw, grinned at me. ‘You 
were sure headed somewhere. Cap- 
tain. It took Frank and me both to 
stop you.” 

1 glanced down at a freshly 
skinned pair of knuckles. It was the 
first time I’d seen ja igrin on his 
craggy face and in spite of myself 
I grinned back. “You know, I’ve 
always wanted to punch an E-Man. 
But when I do, I can’t remember 
it!” 

He came back with a right, light 
answer. “We like the Navy, too. Our 
best people are the ones we steal 
from them.” 

Sometimes trivial things tilt the 
scale. That exdiange might have 
eased the tension, saved some lives, 
except that when he spoke his left 
eyebrow arched. For tihat was when 
1 should have hit the panic but- 
ton. We could have made it then, 
probably. I felt in my bones that 

IF 



something was wrong. But I just 
didn’t like Walt Kiihy» and 1 knew 
that’s what he would want to do. 

1 wouldn’t have liked him, of 
course, under any circumstances, 
not at first. We’re all competitive. 
Why is it you look a guy in the 
eye and put muscle into your grip 
wh^ you first meet him? You’re 
being friendly? Nuts! The ape in 
you ds wondering if you can take 
him. And Walter Khby was a lot of 
things I wasn’t. He was E-Service, 
to begin with. And he was six-one to 
my five-eleven. He had acquired that 
lean look you get living in one of 
those half-alive E-Ships out on the 
periphery while I had been ‘‘Moon- 
face” at the Academy. 1 lost the 
name, and my knuckles heialed be- 
fore 1 ran out of demerits; but it 
was touch and go. But Kirby had 
been out — away out and back — 
and this was my first deep jump in 
the Command Chair. 

And the Co-Pilot’s chair was on 
my mind, too. It had been assigned, 
with my conniving, to Ellen Holt. 
She was another of those slim, 
rangy types, with a face anything 
but craggy but a type much like — 
I often thought sourly — Walt Kir- 
by. Even in flat heels, which she 
was always thoughtful enough to 
wear when she went to dinner with 
me, she walked like a dancer. She 
could zip herself into one of those 
floppy EVA suits without an un- 
graceful movement, which takes 
some doing. Ever have to turn your 
back on a Vice-Admiral who was 
hopping around trying to get the 
other foot started? 

CENOTAPH 


But I’d seen her watching Kirby 
in the mirror over the Command 
Boards, her indigo eyes waim in a 
way they had never waitmed for 
me. Oh, he was the competition, all 
right! 

And I’d been aware of him every 
second of the month he bad been 
with us, except for a couple of 
minutes a week back, at plan^all. 
I had done an astrogation job I 
was pleased with, and when we 
winked out I bad the warm feel- 
ing it was right. Ellen took a fast 
fix on the key stars and smBed, nod- 
ding. I checked the board to her, 
feeling smug, and called, “Well, 
there she is. Pioneers. MacKenzie’s 
World. And right where be said to 
look.” 

n 

A ll four of them crowded for- 
ward, but nobody ^ke over a 
murmur until we were down to 
where Mora II hung in the screen 
like a fire and opal on black velvet. 
Th^ gathered around a survey 
scanner, zooming in segments ot 
the image for detaO. Big Frank 
Lindsay, a six-two, shaggy-bear of an 
engineer, was checking wateop^eds 
and rivers. Standing as close as pos- 
sible to him, as usual, was tiny, pert, 
straw-haired June Logan, MD, 
who was among other things dou- 
bling with us as a naturalist. 

She touched Henry Mercer on the 
arm and pointed to a plateau area. 
Henry smiled like a shy gnome. He 
called himself a dirt farmer in search 
of dirt to farm, since there’s sure 
none left on Terra. The little agron- 

79 



omist grinned. “You’ll have to lift 
me some water into the high flat- 
land, Frank.*’ 

I was grinning with them. This 
looked good. But I felt my face 
freeze again as my eyes caught the 
speculative look on E-Captain Kir- 
by’s face. He was frowning at our 
purple jewel as if he expected the 
colors to flow and take the shape 
of a hooded cobra. I felt my face 
flush. 

“Weil, Captain? Matches Mac- 
Kenzie’s log so far, doesn’t it?” 

The chip on my shoulder weighed 
heavy, for needling never reached 
him. He had the kind of confident 
air some inen are bom with, and it 
had been firmied to an aura by years 
of giving more orders than he took. 
He nodded courteously. 

“That’s not the point. Captain. 
The log is incomplete. It’s what 
MacKenzie did not record that wor- 
ries us.” 

I felt Ellen’s slim fingers on my 
arm, but I was resentful enough that 
when big Frank turned to him I 
didn’t stop it. Frank growled, “Come 
off it. Captain. Colonization is do- 
ing its own preliminary work this 
time, rememiber? That’s why we’re 
here, three months ahead of the big 
ship. And look at that planet. What 
could he wrong with it? 

Kirby’s left eyebrow arched. “Per- 
haps nothing. We just don’t know. 
We didn’t get a chance to check 
it out.” 

“Exactly! And that’s what’s grip- 
ing your bosses. You know what? 
I think they’re just being touchy 
about precious prerogatives, piqued 
purple because Mora II was snatch- 

80 


ed out of their hot little hands. When 
word got out. Colonization grabbed 
Mora.” 

That had ibeen about the way of 
it. A ship, a scarred and pitted mu- 
seum piece of a ship, had drifted 
into Sol’s system, pulsing faint 
identification signals which took a 
shook-up sentry network thirty 
frantic minutes to identify. Even 
then, they didn’t believe it For the 
ship was a ghost, a flying Dutch- 
man, an E-Ship long since re- 
corded as lost without trace. It 
was checking in, with a survey re- 
port on an unnamed planet, a jewel 
of a planet as we now could see. 

But , the survey was incomplete, 
the ship had crept home on atomics 
only, and to the wrong port. E-Ser- 
vice had long since moved out to- 
w^d the fringe, and the pilot, Ja- 
son MacKenzie, had never heard 
of it. He had been sprawled on the 
deck, a recorder mike in one hand 
and an empty machine pistol in the 
other,, for a little over a hundred 
years. 

E verybody knew that story. And 
Kirby nodded agreeably to 
Frank. “You may be right. Every 
Department has its quota of stuffed 
sihirts. I rate as one of the stuffiest, 
in some circles. But the fact re- 
mains we didn’t get to check this 
one out. We didn’t get his ship or his 
tapes until they had been handled.” 
“But what could the Terran In- 
spectors have missed?” 

Kirby’s eyebrow arched again. “We 
just don’t know. There was dust, of 
a cell structure nobody had even 
seen, in the air filters. The cleanup 

IF 



units must 'have functioned for a 
half century. And the ship was never 
phased into high drive. MacKenzie 
died on the deck, shooting at some- 
thing. There were lead scars on 
the lock.” 

I had been intrigued by those 
marks. I had an old gun, newer by 
a century but similar to the one 
that made them. Mine was a good- 
luck piece, but I was diffident about 
it; I didn’t show it around. It was 
clipped under my chair, and I was 
thinking about it when Frank voiced 
the old argument, the clincher. 

“But the lead smears showed he 
was shooting after the lock had 
closed And there was nothing there. 
He was ship-happy. The last of his 
tape was garbled!” 

1 |)ut a stop to it then. It had all 
been hashed over on far higher 
levels than this. It had been de- 
cided to divert Voyager II, send 
an advance party — us — and if 
Mora II checked, bring in the colon- 
ists. The best the by-passed Ex- 
ploration Department had been able 
to get was permission to ferry out 
an observer — Kirby — to go with 
the point barge. 

So I cut it off. “Okay! Okay! 
We’re going in!” 

And Kirby helped. He wasn’t 
above record monitoring and lab 
work. We did it right, by the book. 
For forty hours we orbited the tro- 
posphere, mapping and sending 
down homing scoop missiles which 
brought back air, water, soil and 
shreds of vegetation. And Mora II 
invited us in. We couldn’t even find 
micro-organisms we couldn’t cope 
with. Little Doctor Logan scoffed at 
CENOTAPH 


US as babies and for every bug that 
looked doubtful punched a hole in 
an arm. “You’re eager to get down, 
aren’t you? Want to wait for a 
hypospray mix?” We grounded in 
that flaring orange sunset, and I put 
them to work. 

And within an hour the first of 
those sunlit nightmares started me 
off on a zombie walk towiaid the 
swamp and left me feeling brain- 
washed. 

We lauded that one off, put it 
down to strain, tension, the adjust- 
ment you have to make, to any new 
landfall mega-years from home. You 
can get to feeling insecure when you 
realize how far from home you can 
get just within our own little dust- 
mote galaxy. By dinner we were a 
little on the ribald side with Henry 
Mercer’s slhy-gnome grin beaming 
as he boast^ how he had slipped 
the bottle of Cabernet past me and 
my loading check list. I was gjad 
he had. It was good wine. And 
when the glass fell out of my hand 
my last clear, if idiotic, thought was 
“>^at a waste!” 

T his time I didn’t black out. I 
found I could fight it, pulling 
myself back by sheer will power, 
the way you can sometimes come 
out of a normal bad dream when 
you know you are dreaming and 
have to force your eyes open, con- 
centrating every bit of will you have 
on the flexing of just one little 
muscle. The room gradually came 
back into focus, and suddenly I 
broke free. I surged to my feet when 
I saw it had also hit, and was hold- 
ing, Ellen Holt and Henry Mercer. 

81 



They sat staring, but little Hen- 
ry’s eyes were screaming. Ellen 
fought it off and her eyes went to 
me and then to Walt Kirby. Her 
hanxls gripped the tialble^ knuckles 
white; and she shook her head sav- 
agely, her cloud of black hair swirl- 
ing aaid settling. When her eyes met 
mine again, they were sane and held 
recognition, touched with wonder 
and stark disbelief. But Henry 
couldn^t handle it. 

As 1 lunged around the table I 
heard Ellen’s voice, speaking to 
Kirby, “I’m all right. Help Henry!” 
Th^ June Logan brushed past me, 
no longer a straw-haired bit of fluff 
looking up at her big engineer, but 
a doctor going about her work and 
get the hell out of my way, Captain 
Sir! She slammed the bell of a hypo- 
spray over on artery in Henry’s neck; 
and the little man jerked, trying to 
pull away. Frank Lindsay tilted the 
table and spilled the trays to the 
floor as 1 lifted the little man and 
hdd him down. In a moment he 
quieted, his eyes stopped screaming 
and then closed as the drug hit. 

I looked a question at June, and 
she said, “Deepsleep, Captain. HeTl 
be comatose until dawn or later. I 
hit him pretty hard.” 

I had no chip on my shoulder 
for this little trooper, or for any- 
one dse, now. And there was a 
look on her face. I said, “Don’t go 
formal on me, June. We all know 
this isn’t what we thought it might 
be when it hit me — a green com- 
mander’s retreat from responsibility. 
That stuff you used is dangerous, 
so you had a reason” Do you know 
what this is?” 

82 


Her eyes grew dark. “No. But I’ve 
seen lab animals, harmless, friendly 
little fellows, and big, intelligent 
chimps, with that kind of look in 
their eyes. It happend during limbic 
system experiments, cortex imprint 
attempts. They went comatose, or 
they died.” 

I turned to Ellen Holt. Her eyes 
were wide and sober, too, but nor- 
mal. She was another tough one. 
Survive to adulthood on Titan and 
then claw your way through the 
competition getting into and through 
the Academy on Terra, and you 
come out steady. I asked, “Can you 
remember anything?” 

She turned to Kirby, and again I 
felt a iflaire from the newly lowered 
boiling point I had acquired. But 
she had a question for him, not a 
report. She asked, “Captain Kirby, 
did Jason MacKe^e have a wifef ’ 
His eyes lit with interest, and his 
tongue touched his upper lip. I 
found my own lips were dry, too. 
He wasn’t such a damn superman! I 
gritted my teeth in annoyance at my- 
self as he answered, “Yes. Why?” 
“I. ... I must have read some- 
thing about her or have seen a 
tape.” There was a question in her 
tone, as if she were hoping he would 
agree. But he shook his head. “No 
photographs We know of. And noth- 
ing from his personal file has ever 
been published.” 

She turned to me then. “I. 

I was afraid of that. In fact, St^ve, 
I’m a little afraid, period. Hallucin- 
ation is one thing, but I. ,re~ 
membered her, his wife. And I . 
saw-felt-remembered .... myself 
on the deck of a ship, his ship. I’ve 

IF 



seen it, but I’ve never seen one of 
tihose old imiaciliine pistols. But I was 
using one. I was shooting at some- 
thing that was flowing and shape- 
less, but changing shape. The gun 
jammed, and I slapped it and clear- 
ed it. I knew how to clear itP* 

“You would in a dream or hallu- 
cination.” 

“I suppose so. But I was shooN 
ing at . myself. I could feel 
the slugs hitting me\ It hurt, and I 
was fearful and enraged. And then 
there were flashes which I simply 
couldn’t understand. Then you, 
Steve, seemed to be with me, too; 
and I found I could pull away, and 
I sould see the room again.” 

T he five of us stood silently, 
staring at each other, glancing 
now and then at the deeply un- 
conscious Henry Mercer. Did I say 
it’s pointless to second-guess? It is. 
But that was when I should have 
pidked up the ninetenths dead Henry 
Mercer, yelled for the rest to fol- 
low and then yelled at the autopilot 
for three G’s sitrai^t up and ig- 
nored countermands! We might still 
have made it. 

But I waited. I turned to Kirby 
and a^ed, “Do you people in Ex- 
ploration know anything about this 
planet we don’t know?” 

He shook his head firmly. “No, 
Captain. Except for Jason Mac- 
Kienzie, a hundred years ago, no 
Exploration people have/ been here 
to our knowledge. Anld since this 
.... hallucination, or whatever it is 
. has not hit me as yet, you 
know more about it than I do. But 
I bdieve we should pull out.” 
CEKOTAPH 


“I thought so, too. But I was 
proud. I walked, I did not run, to 
the nearest exk. I said, “So do I. 
Daylight, we’ll load the essentials 
back into the barge and get back 
to Voyager and the hx)spital. Henry 
needs help, and this place needs 
a going over by some of your ex- 
perts.” 

Understatement of the century. 
Long before daylight we bad all 
gone into that nightmare state — 
some helpless, unable to move, some 
of us walking, silently screaming 
zombies. 

For very soon we were past 
screaming aloud. Did you ever 
dream of falling? Knowing, in that 
half-awake state, that if you don’t 
wake yourself up before you hit you 
will die? You can live widi that. You 
know you will wake up. All those 
people who die in their sleep die 
from other causes. Your own night- 
mares, the kind that psychia- 
try scrubs dean and hangs out in 
the sun for you to contemplate at 
leisure, you can live with. They’re 
made up of your own fears and 
memories, distorted, twisted into 
horror, but horror that is expressed 
in symbols which are also yours, 
of your own imagining. 

These symbols were not ours and 
were not imaginable. They weren’t 
the vaporinigs of the hydrogen cy- 
anide scum of our own seething, 
lightning slashed little mud-ball. 
These symbols had their genesis in 
some unspeakably alien kind of 
primordial slime. 

I came out of it, partially, at day- 
light and foimd I was dumbly 
watching another nightmare being 

83 



acted out, found myself watching a 
shaky, shambling Henry Mercer and 
then following him. He shuffled 
blindly, to and into the barge, and 
1 stood in a sweating, trembling state 
of lambivalence, knowing I should 
stop him 'but stomething in my 
mind approving esvery move he 
made, urging him on. 

He was slow, still burdened I 
suppose by the drug left in his 
bloodstream and certainly burdened 
by the horrors in his mind. And he 
was disarming us. Methodically, he 
gathered up every weapon we had, 
one by one, even to Time Lx>gan’s 
anesthetic dart gun she used to col- 
lect lalb animals. One by one he 
made a pile of them, on top of the 
barge autopilot. Then he came to 
me and lifted the ruby jewel light- 
beam chopper from its holster. 

I did scream, then, and nearly 
blacked out trying to move first 
an arm and then a Anger to stop 
him. Kirby wias beside me by then, 
his own eyes haunted, no longer the 
cold-eyed, calm-faced, deep-jump 
pilot. I found 1 knew a great deal 
about Kilby, what he had seen and 
done, what he was capable of doing, 
what kind of a man he wias — quite 
a man, I thou'^t. It was being. 
reflected. back to me from. 
somewhere. Ellen Holt was there, 
somewhere in the boat, approach- 
ing. I seemed to know a great many 
things about her, too. June Logan 
was somewhere. , not near. 
with Frank Lindsay. Lindsay was a 
.... blank. gray. and 
Logan was part woman, part doc- 
tor, trying to help him. 

84 


But I also found I could move. 
I couldn’t move toward the still 
shambling Henry Mercer. I had to 
watch him, with even an occasional 
sickening flash of something like 
approval, as he carefully set the 
chopper he had taken from me and 
turned it against the pile of weapons, 
methodically cutting them and the 
autopilot and the subspace radio 
beside it, to smoking slag. 

But I could move back, away 
from him. I found I could make 
my hands do as I told them, al- 
though the effort made cold sweat 
break out over my body. I concen- 
trated on one hand and made it 
slide under the pilot chair and grip 
the old weapon, my museum piece, 
good-luck charm and bring it up. 

I called, “Henry! Drop it!” He 
looked around, a flicker of recog- 
nition in his eyes. My own mind 
reeled suddenly, but I found I could 
grind my teeth and keep my vision 
clear. I saw recognition fade from 
the little man’s eyes and saw his 
eyes slide past me and focus on 
Ellen, who was standing beside me. 
Then he looked at me, and his 
voice was hoarse, barely over a 
whisper. 

“Useless. ... all but one. The 
others are. weak. mad. 
hold back. ...” 

He brought up the chopper, its 
glittering jewel centering on Ellen 
at my side," while I kept shouting, 
“Henry! Stop it! Drop it!” His eyes 
were screaming again, and his thin 
hand was tightening on the grip 
when I shot him. 

My mind reeled again, and I 
thought I felt the lead slug slam 

IF 






into my own chest. Then I was 
standing clear headed and breath- 
ing hard, watching the little man, 
slumped ^agaiinsit the wall where the 
slug had driven him. His thin body 
tensed, and 1 called to him again 
when he used whait must have been 
the last of his strength to lift one 
arm and drop the chopper into the 
heap of smoking slag. Then his face 
crumpled, and he looked like a child 
who has been slapped for something 
it doesn’t understand. That look 
passed as i^en choked a sob and 
dropped to her knees beside him. He 
looked up as she took his hand, and 
then he looked at me. 

H e was Henry Mercer again, the 
little farmer with the shy-gnome 
face who had grinned because he 
had slipped an over-weight bottle of 
wine past me. He said, “You held 
out a gun, Steve. Good boy.” He 
coughed li^tly and raised a hand 
to wipe his lips. Then he smiled 
again. “Thanks, Steve.” 

Ellen looked up, her face broken, 
and whi^ered, **He*s dead.” I look- 
ed down at the gun, and she must 
have seen on my face what was in 
my mind for she cried, “Steve! You 
didn’t kill Henry Mercer. You killed 
a. fragment. ... of some- 
thing else.” 

Her eyes held mine for an in- 
stant. Then they slid past me and 
widened with fear. But this time 
it was sane, normal human fright 
and disbelief. Her scream, when it 
came, was not from a nightmare but 
was a full-throated cry of protest 
and warning. ‘Walt! No! Steve, 
look out!” 


I was slow. Kirby, his craggy 
face all cold purpose and com- 
pletely void of the nightmare look, 
chopped my wrist with one hand 
and with the other grasped the old 
pistol. I wheeled and aimed stiffened 
fingers at his solar plexis, missed 
and went for his eyes. I brought up 
an aim to ward off a chop at my 
neck, caught his throat with the 
edge of my hand and saw him 
grimace and choke. But it was a 
wrong move. It left me open, and 
he threw me off balance with a 
swing of his hip. Something, the 
barrels of the old gun, the edge 
of his hand, took me across the tem- 
ple; and li^ts flared and then went 
out. 

I came out of it with a throbbing 
headache which faded and a 
crimson rage which pulsed and 
flared. The scuttling hdf-memories 
were no longer leering at me. I 
started to surge up from the table 
and found June Logan, all doctor 
and no damn nonsense, had a hand 
on my shoulder. She ordered, “Stay 
put, patient. Tm in cotumiand in this 
little area. Captain 'Kirby seems 
to be , in command elsewhere. He’s 
been in touch with the source of our 
trouble, too. But he has learned its 
language — or it has learned his!” 
There was contempt in her tone. 
Kilby was sitting alone at the other 
end of the room, his face more cold 
and craggy than ever, with my gun 
on his knee. He said, “She’s r^t, 
Captain. How much can you re- 
memiber?” 

“Enou^ to know you weren’t 
in any zombie state when you took 

IF

me. rU see you in court for that, 
if I don’t kill you first myself I” 
iElis eyebrows arched again. 
“Good! I hope you’re intelligent 
enough to see that that last is what 
you may have to do. Not that I 
have any intention of permitting it. 
But k would show you are bright 
enough to be useful.” 

The rage simmered down, leav- 
ing me cold and wary. “Useful to 
us, you imply. You’ve thrown in 
with that. that. .” 

“That what, Captain?” 

I felt Logan’s hand grip my 
shoulder, and I heard Ellen say, 
“Don’t Steve!” My eyes must have 
screamed like Henry’s for an in- 
stant But it was from finally 
acknowledged awareness. I heard 
myself whisper, “I don’t believe 
it!” 

“You’d better believe it. Captain. 
It’s as real as a iPrycon Plague virus, 
blown up a thousand times. It’s a 
bug-eyed monster without eyes. It 
doesn’t need them. It is all eye, all 
braii^ all body, as needed. Effective 
fomoL” 

I heard him, but it didn’t regis- 
ter. I said stupidly, .“There’s some- 
thing out. ... in that swtamp.” 

I could see-sense-feel-remember — 
there was no one word. I had been 
a part of something. ... alien. 
Something that had been here for 
— there was no way of measuring 
the time. There were fragments of 
some kind of — ship? — something 
that had .... encysted .... it, at 
the bottom of thait swamp. 

Kiriby smiled coldly. “Shakes you, 
doesn’t it? But we bad to meet 
alien life somewhere, sometime, 
CENOTAPH 


Captain. It happened to be here. 
Doctor Logan agrees with me that 
any kind of life than can evolve 
sooner or later will evolve, some- 
where. This form came into being 
in another galaxy, before our own 
galaxy was form^.” 

I forced myself so calm down, 
and I looked around at June. She 
nodded. “You’ll remember it, Steve, 
if you let yourself. It ‘sees’ — that’s 
not strictly accurate — whenever 
it needs to with its whole body. In 
its natural state its mind is part 
of a communal mind, aware of 
everything any one individual comes 
in contact with, sharing everything 
with all other individuals.” 

“What is it doing to us?” 

She removed her restraining hand. 
“Experimenting, I think. There were 
two, originally, and this one learned 
something when MacKenzie found 
them. Learned that ants cap bite. 
Our Captain there points out, and 
I agree, that nobody except a mad- 
man deliberately steps on ants. But 
this thing wants to get home. And 
the Captain also points out that if 
we had to climib up an anthill to 
an escape capsule, we wouldn’t con- 
cern ourselves much about how 
many ants we crushed.” 

I was thinking again, and this 
time I did surge up off the table. 
Kirby’s fingers tightened on the 
pistol, and he grated coldly, “I 
know! I’ll have to kill you first! 
I can, you know. But not first. I 
need you, and to keep you under 
control I’ll start with Doctor Logan. 
Anyway, you last!” 

I didn’t want to believe it. I said, 

87 



“Kirby, it has you under some kind 
of control. Like Henry.” 

June said, “No, Steve. It doesn’t 
control us. But when it shares its 
thinking, its motivation, with us, 
some — Henry for one — - aren’t 
strong enough to override it.” 

“The effect is the same.” 

“In a way, to some degree. It 
is a multiple body with a communal 
mind. But with us the result is a 
sort of confused paralogia. We turn 
— autistic — confuse fantasy with 
reality. Henry wasn’t able to keep 
from following its motivaftions. And 
Frank. • fought it so hard he. • • 
well, Frank is insane, I hope not per- 
manently. Apparently the rest of us 
are in some way stronger.” 

I turned to Kirby, who was still 
smiling coldly. I grated, “And you. 
Captain, seem strongest of us aU. 
You made some kind of deal with 
it, in the hope of saving your skin.** 
“Let’s say I appear to have more 
resistance than any of us. And Fm 
certainly not confusing fantasy with 
reality. I have a trait it bdieves 
will ^ useful. It has no feeling at 
all, naturally, aibout the loss of an 
individual. It has noted that I, 
too, am willing to sacrifice an in- 
dividual.” 

I felt myself frowning ait him, no 
longer clouded by anger. He was 
being wary of his - words, and it 
followed the thoughts behind ihem. 
This just wasn’t right. I found I 
was myself being careful, too. 
“Whait are you going to do, Kirby?” 
“I’m going to try to help it get 
home.” 

“How? That barge out there 
wouldn’t even get back to Terra, 

88 


much the less to another galaxy.” 
“True. But the barge could be 
rigged to move under manual con- 
trols, out far enough to intercept 
the colony ship. That drive might 
do it.” 

T he Colony Ship! Five thousand 
people, some of them children! 
A surge of adrenalin turned the 
room crimson, and I came up out 
of the chair. 

Kirby callled sharply, “Watch it. 
Captain!” I lunged toward him, and 
he fHcked a hand and loosed an 
echoing shot. Horrified, I whirled 
around to see Ellen Holt standing 
pale but unhurt against the wall, 
the mark of the slug making a 
gray smear by her head. Kirby re- 
peated, “Watch it, Captain. The 
bolts from this old crossbow of yours 
ricochet.” 

1 was still peering through a red 
mist. ‘^Kirby, you can’t do that! The 
^thill’ you’re going to help that 
thing climb has five thousand people 
in it. Half of them will go insane 
at first contact. They’ll all die, 
eventuallyl No! Somehow, some of 
us will wreck the barge!” 

“Precisely. They all die, eventual- 
ly. What’s alternative? You force 
me to kill all of you, and I wait 
until the big ship sends someone 
down to investigate. I use that barge. 
It might even be simpler. In any 
event, that thing will get aboard.” 

The crimson mist dissipated, and 
I fdt wary again. “Maybe not, Kir- 
by. Somehow I’ll wreck the drive 
on this barge.” 

He laughed then, the first time 
I had ever heard him. “Watching 

IF 



you and Holt on the way out here, 
I thought you might possibly be po- 
tential irecniiits. Now 1 wonder; Use 
your head. Captain. You can’t dis- 
able that drive unit and you know 
it. You haven’t the tools for it. The 
worst you could do would be to 
booby trap it, disconnect and by- 
pass the dampers, so the drive 
would surge. I’ll be on guard against 
that. Any rewiring you could do I 
could undo.” 

Then he gave us a cold, mirth- 
less smile and backed out of the 
room. We watched as he walked 
puiposefuiUy north, toward the 
swamp. There was a moan from the 
drugged Frank Lindsay, and June 
hurried to him. I sat down weak- 
ly, feeling wrung out, and turned to 
Ellen Holt. She, too, looked done 
in, with sick disappointment show- 
ing on her face. I said dumbly, “He 
just walked away. As if. ... as if 
. hell’s chiming bells, Ellen, I 
learned a lot about that guy while 
we were aU drowning in that cere- 
bral slime. This isn’t like him!” 

Ellen smiled sadly, shaking her 
head. “No, it isn’t. Or like any 
of us.” I guess we were both on the 
edge of hysteria and trying to es- 
cape from this dead-end trap, for 
when she smiled faintly and said, “1 
learned quite a lot about you, too, 
Steve.” I blushed. She went on, “I 
take it as a compliment, Steve. 
What woman wouldn’t? You’re 
something of a man yourself. You 
wouldn’t do what he says he in- 
tends to do, and neither — a para- 
dox, Steve — neither could he!” 

I looked around at her. “Let’s 
go over it, Ellen. There’s a piece 
CENOTAPH 


missing. He was needling me — 
something he never did even when 
I was trying my best to pimoture 
him. He kept telling me to smarten 
up, use my head.” 

She caught her breath, and I be- 
lieve she thought of it at that in- 
stant, as I did. My voice dropped. 
“Why did he point out that we 
couldn’t wreck the barge — that 
the worst we could do was booby 
trap it?” 

She met my eyes. “Why did he 
point out that he was of one mind 
with that thing in ait least one way 
— a willingness to sacrifice an in- 
dividual. Is that what you mean, 
Steve?” 

I came to my feet, feeling cold. 
“Yes. He couldn’t do it himself and 
he didn’t dare tell us directly. He 
wants us to booby trap that drive! 
Come on!” 

W e went at it, with dragging 
feet and reluctant minds. 
June stayed with the drugged and 
incoherent wreck that had been big 
Frank Lindsay, and Ellen went with 
me to the barge. We cleared away 
the now cold fragments of slag 
which had been the autopilot, and 
the communicator and our weapons. 
The drive would lift, on manual. 
And we rigged a manual, one that 
would allow low level manuevering 
and would even let the barge lift to 
perhaps a fiftieth of a diameter. But 
when the main drive cut it it would 
surge — spend itself in one gigantic 
shove — more G’s than had ever 
been tested. 

We worked carefully, our fingers 
and palms damp, watching each 

89 



other for telltale signs that the. • 
thing. • might be moving in on 
one of us again. Once Ellen whis- 
pered, “He. must ibe keeping it 
.... busy.” She kept under con- 
trol, her fingers reluctant but sure, ' 
until the last plate had been brazed 
back in place. Then she dropped 
the torch and buried her face in 
her hands. She said tautly, “Steve 
do you realize exactly what we’re 
doing?” 

I yelled at her, for I- had to 
convince myself, too. “We’re saving 
five thousand people. We’re keeping 
that thing from 'any possible chance 
of getting home with knowledge of 
where and what we are. We’re mak- 
ing it possible for him to do .his 
job!” 

She stood up and carefully put 
away the torch. She looked around 


the control room until her hands 
steadied. Then she took my arm 
with, both her hands and started 
toward the port. Outside, she said, 
faltering, low voiced, “Steve, I’m 
not as strong as I thought. I’m go- 
ing to have to blame somebody 
else for my part in this or lose 
my mind. I’m going to have to hate 
^you, Steve, for a while. Hate you 
like fury.” 

But she held on tightly while we 
walked back to the prefab. And she 
took my arm again when we saw 
him stride out of the woods and 
across the meadow toward the 
barge. 

She then whispered, “Look! He’s 
thrown away the gun. He would, 
have to. It wouldn’t have let him 
near. It. remembers MacKen- 
zie.” 



T he barge lifted, hovered and 
then swung away over the 
woods. Presently it returned, still 
low. It tilted, as if in salute, and 
then lifted, straight up, gaithering 
speed. We waited, tense, the tension 
growing. And there was one more 
nightmare. 

It wtas merely reflection at 'first, 
as if the alien had casually flicked 
us a “glance” in passing. I could 
feel a query, a speculation, and 
could sense the reassurance of Kir- 
by’s thought that there was danger 
in the barge, but that he knew of it 
and could cope with it. But soon 
there was a stronger probing as the 
thing, suspicious, flared at us. Ellen 
gripped my arm and cried out, 
“No!” But it had touched us, enough 
to learn, even though we tried to 
hide it, that what he had done to 


the barge was done because we be- 
lieved Kirby had wanted it. 

There was rage then, in the alien’s 
mind, and there was the real, almost 
tangible, awareness of Kiihy fitt- 
ing back, trying to make Ms hands 
move to the drive switch. It went on 
.... endlessly. with Kirby’s 
struggle raging and faltering and 
the alien’s mind a maelstrom of 
rage. We tried, our futile best, to 
help, and I found my nails cutting 
into my palms as my hands clench- 
ed. 

Then, incredibly, there was a 
weakening in the storm of alien 
rage, a faltering, a dilution. Awe- 
struck, physically sick and tremb- 
bling, we sensed that some of the 
alien patterns were blurring, tak- 
ing a different form, shaping into 
new paths. There was something 



91 



from another will, another entity, 
two others, interferinig. But they 
were not ours! 

We asked ourselves, later on, 
iif we imagined it, I don’t know. But 
there came an instant when we 
seemed linked together, and we 
could sense triumph and when we 
sensed or felt or imagined the same 
words, sulbtly archaic, a “voice** 
with a ring in it: **You were a long 
time on the way. Captain! You 
guys going soft? Let's you and I 
and this gutsy little farmer here 
take this thing! On the count! 

Nowr 

And on the pulse of that exult- 
ant, “NOW!** we felt Kirby’s fingers 
move — that (final fractional inch 
— and there was a iflare in the 
darkening sky. A flare — and then 
nothing. 

I found I was alone, more alone 
than 1 had even been, anywhere, 
with a sobbing girl at my side who 
released my amn and crumpled like 
a doll. 1 sat down beside her and 
pulled her head over against my 
shoulder, and we waited there in 
the growing starlight and listened, 
after a while, to the night sounds 
in the empty meadow. After a long 
time she diw in a great, shudder- 
ing breath and whispered, “I’m all 
right now, Steve. I don’t need to 
hate you any longer.” 


W e waited a month for the 
Colony ship barge, and an- 
other for the big ship itself to go 
into orbit. Then an E-Ship settled 
in the meadow and a grim-faced 
Commodore took our reports and 
questioned us, at our insistence, 
under dru^ whidi gave us total 
recall.^ It left the Commodore pale 
and the technicians shuddering. 
They found and raised the — ship 
— that had dncysted the — thing. 
And it was an unprecedented second 
satellite, tossed out by the colony 
ship, which carried communications. 

The first was the small one we 
just passed, a golden sphere with 
three names engraved on it. It rates 
a salute, from any who pass this 
way. 

What? Sure. Sure. But not to- 
night. Tomorrow. You’ll know us, 
a big engineer with snow white hair 
and a haunted look in his eyes. 
There’ll 'be a straw-haired woman 
who doesn’t look in the least like 
a doctor clinging to his arm. You’ll 
know the other woman, too, black 
hair, blacker eyes. She’s thinned out 
now — as I have — from living in 
one of those half-alive E-Ships out 
on the fringe. She walks like a 
dancer, and she’ll be about my 
height because she’ll be wearing 
low heels. We’ll have that drink with 
you. END

I Patience was often desirable in 

, mingling with the lesser creatures of 

T he butterfly- with .a wounded Man, and the butterfly was, after 

wing glided clumsily down to all, in no hurry,

The spider knew he was there, but with her principal eyes. Her dark 

she was drowsy and ignored him for mind spoke: “Was that your cater-

spider tends to be bad tempered. “Yes, I was its sire,” he replied. 


93 





“Delicious,” she commented lazily. 

“Fin glad you enjoyed it,” he 
said. 

She moved across her web to 
study him more closely. “Your left 
hind wing has a fracture in it,” he 
said. “How did that happen?” 

“I was watdiing the metal-secre- 
ters being attacked by the bees. One 
of them ejected at me and hit the 
wing.” 

“Hold it out,” ^e directed. He 
lower^ his wings, and she examined 
the brok^ area with her feet and 
mandibles. “I can taste the metal,” 
she remari^d. ^This won’t be hard 
to fix 80 it will mend straight. Who 
won the fight?” 

**1110 metal-secreters retreated into 
their flying hive, but then they des- 
troyed many flowers, along with some 
of the be^ and other insects, by 
ejectihg flaming poison from their 
hive.” He could and observe the 
spider’s repair work on his injured 
wing while he conversed with her. 
The pain was a minor annoyance. 

“Are the metal-secreters creatures 
of Man?” she asked. 

He hesitated — unusually ^ be- 
fore answering: “That is beyond my 
knowing. Whatever they are, they are 
outside my knowing of the now-mo- 
ment Fm trying to learn more about 
them.” 

“So am 1,” she replied snappishly, 
“but hardly anybody bothers to tell 
me anything. They seem to think I 
ban sit hm all day and have as big a 
knowing as any creature that flies. 
All 1 get is bits and snatches when 
somebody thinks past me. Man him- 
self could return, and I wouldn’t 
know it unless he lit in my webi” 


“111 tell you about the metal- 
secieters, then, while you fix my 
wing,” said the butterfly. In a way 
he felt sorry for the spider, because 
her complaints were largely justified. 
Man had favored her with some in- 
telligence, but far too little for her 
to achieve a real knowing of the now- 
moment. In fact, she had only a vague 
notion of what the phrase really 
meant. 

B utterflies, the most favored of the 
creatures of Man, had the full- 
est knowing, thanks in part to their 
varied and highly developed sensing 
abilities and to ±e routine thought* 
sharing which took place between all 
members of the order of Lepidop- 
tera. Too, the central nervous sys- 
tem of butterflies was organized for 
extreme efficiency in the use of 
stored knowledge — not for remem- 
bering, which any of the favored 
creatures, including the spider, could 
do very well, but for defining the 
now-moment. The butterfly had a 
clear conception of what was taking 
place, from instant to instant, at all 
points in the populated portion of the 
world. It knew the now-moment 
Perhaps the prime contributor to 
the butterfly’s Imowing was its long 
period of development as a caterpil- 
lar. 

This period lasted most of the 
seventy-four days — each day five 
hundred hours in length — of the 
warm season of the world’s year. 
During that period the caterpillar was 
a passive receiver of ah the traffic 
of thought taking place around it 
It read and stored the knowing not 
only of butterflies and moths but of 

IP 


94 



bees and even ants. The caterpillar 
could not act upon any of this knowl- 
edge. Indeed the central nervous sys- 
tem contained within the larva was 
actually two separate systems — one 
listening detachedly wMe waiting to 
serve the adult butterfly, and the 
other a primitive system guiding the 
caterpillar through its mindless life 
of eating and growing. This latter 
system vanished completely later, 
during the world’s long winter of ut- 
ter cold, to serve as one more morsel 
of warming fuel while the encap- 
sulated insect was in the pupa stage. 
When warmth returned and the world 
sprang alive with soaring flowers, the 
adult butterfly emerged from its wrap- 
pings, fully grown and educated. 

O^y the moth shared so favorable 
a life cycle, and the moth’s need for 
special sensory perception for nigiht 
flying apparently left less room for 
intellectual development. In any 
event, the moth’s knowing was less 
full than the butterfly’s. Third in 
knowing were the bees, and fourth 
the ants. The spiders ran a poor 
fifth, but were certainly far superior 
to the many unfavored creatures 
needed to complete the world’s 
ecology — the aphids, beetles, ter- 
mites and various others. And since 
knowing the now-moment was be- 
yond the spiders’ abilities, they used 
their knowledge for the lesser func- 
tion of remembering. They took con- 
siderable pride in their memories, 
which they claimed were superior to 
those of more favored creatures, but 
the truth was that the hi^er insects 
seldom bothered with remembering. 
The now-moment, to a butterfly, was 
sufficient 


B ut to please the curiosity of the 
spider, who was repairing his 
wing, the wounded butterfly exer- 
cised his memory of the day’s now- 
moments sufficiently to recount the 
story of the metal-secreters. 

“Their hive flies, you know,” he 
told her, “and is made of a hard 
metal. I have no knowing of how 
it is organized inside, or of how it 
flies without wings. It came down 
shortly after sunrise today and settled 
on top of the Rock Hill.” 

“How far from here is that?” she 
asked. 

“About half a mile west,’^ he said. 
“It’s a small mountain of solid rock 
in my hunting ground.” He was try- 
ing to keep the story simple for her, 
not going into detail about the kind 
of metal used in the flying hive or 
the geological nature of the Rock 
HilL “The ants saw it land. When 
the creatures in it unplugged its door, 
the ants tried to go in and know 
what was there. But the creatures 
ejected metal at the ants and killed 
several, so the ants retreated. When 
they did, some of the creatures came 
out of the hive, still ejecting metal 
at the particular ants who were carry- 
ing the bodies of those already killed. 
Well, you know how ants are when 
somebody tries to take food away 
from them . .” 

“I’m the same way,” she inter- 
rupted. 

“They swarmed back, and the 
creatures retreated into their hive and 
plugged the door. The . ants were then 
able to carry away their meat” 
“What are those creatures like? 
Would they be good meat?” the spi- 
der asked with considerable interest. 


THE CREATURES OF MAN 


95 




“They are hard to describe to you, 
since I can’t make you see pictures. 
They are big. Their bodies are al- 
most six times as long as an ant’s — 
twice as long as mine. They move 
about in a very peculiar manner. 
They have no wings, so of course 
they crawl on their legs, which they 
have too few of . .” 

“So do you, for that matter,” 
sniffed the spider. 

“They crawl somewhat like a man- 
tis, or at least more like a mantis 
than like us. Their bodies are thicker 
than the mantis, though. And I sup- 
pose they would be good meat, un- 
less they contain poison metal salts.” 
“I’d like to try one,” she mur- 
mured half to herself. “If I wasn’t 
in such a good location right here, I 
would go hang a new web close to 
their hive and try my luck.” 

“They may be intelligent,” the 
butterfly reminded her. 

“If they are they wouldn’t get 
caught in the web,” she answered; 
and added rather gloatingly, “And for 
all your knowing you don’t know 
if they are even creatures of Man.” 
“That’s true,” he conceded. 

“What happened after the ants 
left?” 

CC^T^he bees came. They are more 
JL disturbed than the ants 
were, because it is a hive as well as 
an emptiness in their knowing. It 
could mean competition for the bees. 
They swarmed around the hive for a 
while, until it began ejecting metal at 
them. They flew some distance away 
and concealed themselves among the 
flowers. Nothing njore happened for 
perhaps twenty hours, and the sun 



was well above the horizon when 
some ants who were keeping watch 
saw the hole in the hive unplugged 
again* 

''This time the ants and the bees 
stayed off the Rock Hill and kept 
their bodies hidden when five of the 
creatures came out” 

"What good did they think hiding 
their bodies could do?” asked the 
spider. "Didn’t they think the crea- 
tures have good senses?” 

"That’s what they did think,” the 
butterfly answered, "and seemingly 
they are right The metal-secreters 
never seem to eject at anything that 
cannot be sensed by Vision. The bees 
and ants stayed hidden among the 
flowers while the creatures crawled 
down from the hill and began explor- 
ing the edge of ther foliage. That 
was when I decided to fly over there 
and observe the creatures directly. 

"When I arrived, the creatures had 
moved a short distance away from 
the hill, using some sharp metal ex- 
trusion from their upper legs to cut 
a path through the flowers. If they 
are knowing creatures, then our world 
is as concealed from them as the in- 
side of their hive is from me, be- 
cause they obviously did not know 
the bees were concealed all along one 
side of the trail, waiting for the crea- 
tures to get deep enough in the flow- 
ers for their retreat to be cut off. 
Some ants were waiting, too, hoping 
to get some meat for themselves. 

"I approached from the side of the 
trail opposite from where the bees 
were hiding and arrived just as the 
bees moved in to attack. The creatures 
saw me first and kept looking up 
at me until the bees almost had diem. 


Then they turned and started ejecting 
at the bees. I saw several bees go 
down, but only one of the creatures 
got stung. Evidently the creatures 
have very tough exoskeletons, made 
mostly of metal, and the bees could 
not find weak spots into which the 
sting could be inserted. Nevertheless, 
the creatures started back to their 
hive, dragging the stung one with 
them, and they finally made it — 
with bees and ants snapping and 
punching at them all the way back 
to the Rock Hill. I was still flying 
about observing, and as soon as the 
creatures were out of the flowers one 
of them ejected at me and hit my 
wing. I came here, and the creatures 
are all in their Mve now. As soon 
as they were in, the hive ejected a 
flaming mass of poisonous substance 
onto the area where they had cut 
the trail. -Luckily, the bees had scat- 
tered by then, and the ants were 
most of the way back to their nests 
loaded with ant and bee meat, so 
the fire did not kill very many.” 

T he spider was almost through re- 
pairing his wing as the butterfly 
ended his account. With a delicate 
touch, she smoothed the surface of 
the hard-setting modification of web- 
stuff with which she had encased 
the major vein-fracture. 

"What are you going to do now?” 
she asked. 

"Now?” he asked. "In the next 
now-moments? As soon as you say 
my wing is ready to be used, I’ll take 
nourishment.” 

"That’s not what I mean,” she 
snapped impatiently. "I mean what 
about the metal-secreters.” 


THE CREATURES OF MAN

A strange question^ thought the 
butterfly. He queried the other butter- 
£Ues» they too agreed it was a 
strange thing to a^ So did the 
moths who» living on the night half 
of the worlds were awake at the mo- 
ment One moth remarked that it was 
just die kind of question one might 
expect from a spider» whose life was 
one long introspection with insuffi- 
cient introspecting equipment . 

'^Nothing/* he answer^ at last **Of 
course^ I will continue trying to fit 
them into my knowing of the now- 
moment.” 

“If you could ever fit them in ” 
she askedt “don’t you think you 
could have done so by now?” 

That “ever” was a meaningiless^ 
spideridi term. What personal sig- 
nificance could “ever” have to the 
butterfly^ who had awakened and 
climbed frcnn his pupa enclosure 
seventeen days befme and who knew 
he would die fifty-five days from 
this particular now-moment, when 
the winter cold returned? “Ev^ to a 
butterfly is one summer season; it is 
the same to a spider, but perhaps en- 
grossed in her legends of memory 
she would not agree with that. 

He answered her question: “Per- 
haps.” 

‘Ttt case of emergency,” she re- 
cited, “a butterfly may Man.” 

“That is true,” he said. 

“Then why don’t you?” she urged. 
“This is an emergency, and you’re a 
butterfly.” 

“Why is this an emergency?” he 
countered. “A few bees and ants have 
died before their normal time, and 
a few flowers have been destroyed 
in one tiny area. For the world as a 


whole, life continues as always for 
the creatures of Man.” 

The truth was that the butterfly 
— all butterflies — regarded Man 
as a rather mythic being. Man had 
doubtless once existed, but an accu- 
rate definition of his attributes was 
no longer available to his creatures. 
The clear picture of Man had been 
lost with the passage of thousands of 
years and thousands of generations. 
The act of calling Man, the butterfly 
felt, could not be integrated into his 
knowing of the now-moment 

“This is an emergency,” the spider 
told him, “because you admit those 
metal-secreters are a blank spot in 
your knowing. When a butterfly ad- 
mits something like that it’s an emer- 
gency!” 

*Tf 1 called Man and he came,” 
said the butterfly, ‘lie would be an- 
other such blank spot How do you 
know these two blanks would be 
mutually eliminating?” 

“All I know is that we are crea- 
tures of Man,” ^e huffed rather 
piously, “and we are supposed to call 
him in need. He brought us to this 
world and remade us and the flowers 
so that we could live here alone from 
him, because this world is not suited 
for Man’s needs, and Man does not 
remake himself. The gravity of this 
world was too sli^t, and the air 
much too thick, for Man to dwell 
here in comfort, nor were the seasons 
suited to beings such as he, who may 
endure for a hundred years.” (She 
was reciting again, the butterfly 
noted.) “He fitted us for this world, 
and gave it to us, but kept us for 
himself, as his creatures, to live for 
Man as well as for ourselves. We 

IP 


98 



haye^ a respoii3ibility to Man. You 
should call him.” 

“The old knowledge says we ‘may* 
call him,” retorted the butterfly. 

“Yes,’ and we ‘may’ disappoint 
him, if he returns some day to find 
his creatures gone and the world 
filled with metal-secreting monsters!” 

“The creatures in that hive won’t 
find much metal to secrete if they try 
to live here,” the butterfly respond- 
ed. “Our stones contain mere traces 
of the heavy elements.” 

Though he was arguing with the 
spider, the butterfly was not at all 
sure he was right. The calling of Man 
was an event that had never occurred; 
thus it was difficult to fit into his 
knowing of the now-moment. But per- 
haps it was the appropriate action to 
take under the present circumstances. 
As the spider had reminded him, it 
was a recourse suggested by Man 
himself. 

“I will go feed while I think about 
it,” the butterfly agreed at last. 

“Will you let me know what you 
decide?” she asked. 

“Yes.” 

II 

H e took to the air and found his 
mended wing was as sturdy as 
ever — as he had known it would 
be. Flying to a group of flowers he 
had not yet visited, he lit on a tall, 
deep-cupped blossom and unrolled 
his proboscis. As he sipped the sweet 
nectar from the bottom of the cup 
he realized that he had made his de- 
cision. 

There was no question about it 
being his decision to make. Butter- 

THE CREATURES OF MAN 


flies do not vote. The others wer^ 
certainly, interest in ^diat his de- 
cision would be, but he was the in- 
dividual directly involved in the mat- 
ter of the metal-secreters. 

The strange hive was on his hunt- 
ing ground. He had seen it himself 
and had been attacked by one of the 
creatures. He had discussed the situ- 
atiou with the spider. In short, this 
was his affair, and his ability to de- 
cide how to conduct it was as good 
as any other butterfly’s. 

He would call Man. The other fa- 
vored creatures would assist him if 
he requested their help. 

Having decided, he continued to 
feed for two hours. Man could not 
be called from his hunting ground — 
that had to be done at a special 
place hundreds of miles away. It was 
best to be well nourished before be- 
gmning such a journey. When his 
feeding took him close to the spider’s 
web, he kept his promise to tell her 
what he was going to do. She haught- 
ily approved. 

The day was still younger than 
mid-morning when he took a last sip, 
climbed higher in the air than usual 
and began the long flight westward. 
He had never come this way before 
— in fact, he had never traveled 
far from his hunting ground in any 
direction. But he found nothing 
strange in the countryside below him, 
no wonderful new sights to see. He 
knew the now-moment, and what he 
saw was what he had known was 
there to see. 

When he grew hungry after sev- 
eral hours of flight, another butter- 
fly, a Swallowtail like himself, called 
invitin^y: “Come down and feast 


99 



and rest. My flowers are sujitable, 
sweet and^entiful.” ;tle accep^d the 
offer and lighted in the other’s hunt- 
mg ground whero he fed, napped and 
^d again until mid-morning. Then 
he resumed his journey. 

H e made five more such stops be- 
fore the terrain began to change 
from the lush, slightly undulating 
plain into a more rugged and ele- 
vated landscape where the flowers 
grew in less abundance. He was ap- 
proaching a towering range of moim- 
tains. As he climbed with the land, 
the atmosphere grew noticably thin- 
ner; breathing and flying required 
increased vigor, and his periods of 
rest became longer and more frequ- 
ent. But he was nearing his goal. 

He reached a spot near the upper 
end of a higih valley, with only one 
more tremendous barren ridge to fly 
over. He had left the area in which 
butterflies lived and hunted far be- 
hind; at this elevation the flowers 
were too small and sparse to support 
the likes of himself in comfort. 

. He fluttered down to light on a 
rock near a beehive. Several bees 
came out and examined him with 
wonder. To their limited knowing he 
was a sight at which to marvel, gigan- 
tic in size and with wings the colors 
of many flowers. And he was a but- 
terfly, which meant he was wise. 

“You are welcome here, butterfly- 
who-is-going-to-call-Man,” they told 
him, *^ough you will eat so much, 
doubtless, that you will set our popu- 
lation expansion program back at 
least a year. Never has a butterfly 
visited our hive before. It will please 
us to serve you well.” 

TOO 


“I am grateful,” he responded, 
“especially since you do not have 
plenty.” 

“What we have you will find 
good,” they replied. 

And he did. The bees fed him 
honey, and his knowing was shocked 
most pleasantly by its heavy richness 
and* almost overwhelming sweetness. 
Never before, he realized, had a but- 
terfly been so hungry and fed so de- 
liciously. It was a wonderful and 
novel now-moment to know. 

After he had been fed and had 
drunk from a shaded, icy spring, he 
napped by the water for several hours. 
Then the bees fed him more honey 
and, thoroughly invigorated, he be- 
gan the last segment of his journey. 

He needed all the strength the 
honey gave him. As he made his way 
up the steep final slope, the thinning 
air became hardly sufficient to sus- 
tain him, no matter how hard he 
worked his wings, ^d it seemed all 
but impossible to pump his abdomen 
fast enough to bring as much 
oxygen as he needed into his body. 
Long before he reached the summit 
he was reduced to making short, 
hopping flights of only a few yards 
at a time, from one ledge to the next, 
interspersed with rests for breathing. 

The last fifty yards of the ascent 
he did not fly at all, but crawled. 
When he came in sight of the Nest 
That Man Left he was tempted to 
stop where he stood and sleep, but 
the chill in the air told his knowing 
that this would be unwise. He made 
his way clumsily over the leveled 
ground of the mountaintop toward 
the entrance of the rambling metal 
structure. 

IF 




As he did so he realized that the 
Nest That Man Left was another 
emptiness in his knowing. That was 
not surprising,' though, since it was 
at an unpopulated, imvisited location. 
His knowing told him only what the 
outer appearance of the Nest would 
be, and where it was to be entered. 
The inside was as blank as that of 
the metal-secreters’ hive. With a sense 
of uneasiness in the face of the im-i 
known, intensified by the strained 
condition of his body, the butterfly 
crawled to the entrance. 

The Nest sensed his presence and 
opened the door as he approached. 
He went inside without a pause, and 
the door slid closed behind him. 


T he interior was dark at first but 
brightened immediately as over- 
head panels shifted to let in sun- 
light through a wide expanse of glass. ^ 
The walls hissed as an oxygen-rich ^ 
flood of air pressed in to bring the 
thickness up to a level the butterfly 
found comfortable. A trough in the^ 
floor gurgled and filled with water, ^ 
and he drank gratefully. These ^ 
events were all unexpected, of course, 
but there was a definite rightness 
about them. This was the way a but- 
terfly should be received in Ae Nest 
That Man Left, and it was not diffi- 
cult to place in his knowing. 

The Nest addressed him: “You t 
are a butterfly, and you are here 
to call Man.” The mind of the Nest 
was shrouded, somewhat like that of @ 
the spider except for an absence of M 
^rsonality. n 

“Yes,” the butterfly responded. 

THE CREATURES.OF AAAN . ■IK 




“I am the voice of the Nest, a 
contrivance that does not live but 
that can converse with you to a lim- 
ited extent. Do you have injuries or 
umuet needs that are an immediate 
danger to you?” 

“No.” The butterfly’s senses 
searched his surroundings while the 
voice addressed him, and he gained a 
partial knowing of the nature of the 
voice contrivance. Man had to be 
wise, indeed, to construct such a 
complex dead device and to shelter 
it so perfectly that, after untold thou- 
sands of years, it could still awaken 
and engage in a conversation of 
minds. 

“Do butterflies continue to know 
the now-moment?” the Nest asked. 

“Yes.” 

‘That is an ability Man did not 
give me, and one that he lacks him- 
self,” the Nest told him. “Thus I do 
not know the nature of the emergency 
that brings you here. Nor do I know 
where Man is, nor what he may have 
become during the centuries since he 
made me, mutated your ancestors and 
departed.” 

“Man does not change himself, ac- 
cording to my knowing,” commented 
tile butterfly. 

“Not intentionally, perhaps, but he 
changes nevertheless. He is a discon- 
tented being who, not knowing the 
now-moment, wanders and searches 
for new things to know. What he 
finds changes him, not in the order- 
ly manner in which he fitted you for 
conditions on this world, but in ways 
that are unplanned and sometimes un- 
desirable. Occasionally he finds some- 
thing very damaging to him, some- 
thing that darkens his intelligence 


and Ciiiuses him to fdrget itiuch of 
his learning from previous findings.” 

T he butterfly struggled with this 
information. His difficulty was 
not that what the Nest told him 
was new. On the contrary, it was 
ancient; so ancient that it hhd been 
all but forgotten -a dismissed as hav- 
ing no meaning to current knowing. 
It occurred to the butterfly that per- 
haps the creatures of Man had 
wanted to forget that Man could not 
know the now-moment, which im- 
plied that Man was inferior to them- 
selves. But then, he quickly reassured 
himself, Man must have completely 
different abilities that made him su- 
perior — abilities so far beyond a 
butterfly’s comprehension that the 
Nest would not attempt to describe 
them. 

At last he addressed the Nest: 
“Then if I call Man, the being who 
responds may be unlike the beings 
who established the creatures of Man 
on this world. He may even have 
forgotten that he has such creatures 
as us.” 

“That is correct,” the Nest re- 
sponded. “Man instructed me to be 
sure you understood that before he 
was called. If he comes, the results 
will be unpredictable. You are to 
reconsider the nature of your emer- 
gency with this in mind and decide 
if your need for Man is sufficient 
for you to accept the uncertainties 
of his present nature.” 

This was a difficult decision in- 
deed. The butterfly thought about 
it for several minutes before saying, 
“In essence, the emergency is an in- 
tellectural one. An area of blankness 


102 


IF 



has entered our knowing. Since Man 
does not know the now-moment, it 
is possible that we could not ex- 
plain to him the nature of the emer- 
gency.” 

“That is possible,” agreed the Nest. 
“In any event, unless Man has 
changed greatly, you will be unable 
to communicate with him directly. 
Man does not speak mind-to-mind, 
the way you and I are conversing, 
but through the use of special sounds 
he can emit, each sound being a sym- 
bol of a fragment of thought.” 

“Then how could we have ever 
communicated?” asked the astonished 
butterfly. 

“Through intermediary devices 
such as myself,” said the Nest. “You 
can talk to me and I can put your 
thoughts into the words of Man, like 
this.” The Nest emitted, from a wall 
cavity, a complex series of noises. 

T he butterfly listened in stunned 
recognition. He had never heard 
such sounds before today, but as he 
had hovered over the metal-secreters 
earlier that morning just such noises, 
though dim and muffled, had struck 
his sensors. But Man was supposed 
to be ten-fingered — more manipula- 
tory members than even the spider! 
And the metal-secreters had clearly 
been deficient in this respect, having 
only two pairs of legs. 

The Nest was continuing: “Com- 
munication is rendered more com- 
plex by the use of differing sets of 
sound-symbols, called lan^ages and 
by the fact that a given set of sym- 
bols tends to change with the passage 
of years to become an entirely new 
language. I probably would not know 


the sounds man uses today, but would 
have to communicate your thoughts, 
with some explanation, to a device 
similar to myself that Man brought 
with him, and that device iu turn 
would speak to Man.” 

“Man uses metal extensively, does 
he not?” asked the butterfly. 

“Yes. Metals were abundant, on 
his, and your, original planet. He 
built his nests of them and other 
-dead materials, and also his flying 
shelters in which he journeyed here 
and to many other worlds.” 

“What are fingers?” 

“They are relatively small, slender 
extensions of Man’s arms, his upper 
legs. They are useful for gripping 
and manipulating. He has ten of 
them, normally.” 

“I wish to call him,” said the but- 
terfly. 

“Very well . The call is now 
being emitted. I do not know when 
he will arrive. He may have to come 
far, a journey of more than a day 
for his fastest shelter. Certainly, he 
cannot be expected to arrive within 
a hundred hours at best. As there is 
no food stored for you here, I sug- 
gest you return to your hunting 
ground to await him.” 

“My knowing is unsure,” replied 
the butterfly, “but I believe Man to 
be quite close. I will wait outside, at 
least for a while. It is certain he 
will respond to the call?” 

“If he does not,” the Nest said, 
“he will have changed too greatly to 
be of any assistance to you. , I am 
preparing to open the door.” 

The air thinned; the door opened, 
and the butterfly went out ontp the 
mountaintop. TUs was the kind of 


THE CREATURES OF AAAN 


.103 



air Man could breathe without the 
protection of an artificial exoskele- 
tOD» tlie butterfly reasoned. Thus this 
mountaintop was the place where 
Man should be met by his creatures. 

IV 

H e was hardly outside when the 
knowing came that the flying 
hive of the “metal-secreters” had lift- 
ed from the Rock Hill back in his 
hunting ground. It was hurtling to- 
ward him almost with the speed of 
a meteorite, but when it arrived it 
landed as gently as the butterfly could 
have descended onto a flower. 

The Nest commented: “So your 
emergency was Man himself . They 
have a device with them to permit 
communication.’* Nearly an hour 
passed before the butterfly was ad- 
dressed again: “A Man is coming out 
now. I have told him about this 
world.” 

The butterfly watched with a touch 
of awe as the Man came out of the 
unplugged hole in the flying hive. 
Without his artificial exoskeleton, but 
with most of his body covered with 
brightly colored woven material, he 
still looked very odd — but not like 
some freakish creature who could se- 
crete metal. The butterfly’s senses in- 
formed him that, without his woven 
coverings, Man would appear rather 
drab: pink all over except for a scat- 
tering of dark hair and for the eyes 
which were small and one-faceted. 

Still, there was an austere attrac- 
tiveness in the Man’s appearance and 
a startling grace in the way he crawl- 
ed, precariously balanced On his rear 
legs. The Mien had looked less grace- 


ful earlier in the morning, using all 
four legs to push their way through 
the flowers and the attacking bees, or 
to climb the steep side of Rock Hill. 
Apparently Man was designed to 
crawl best over level, unobstructed 
ground. 

The Man advanced to stand before 
the butterfly, his small eyes studying 
the insect as the insect studied the 
Man. The wings seemed to fascinate 
the Man. When held in a resting, 
vertical position their tips were ap- 
proximately a third as high off the 
groimd as the top of the Man’s head. 

A series of sounds came from the 
Man’s mouth. 

“He is asking your name,” explain- 
ed the Nest. “That is an abstract 
symbol you would use to identify 
yourself, as an individual, from the 
other butterflies. I have explained 
that, while butterflies have individual- 
ity, you have no use for names be- 
cause of the way you communicate.” 
“You (Man) may give me a name 
if you wish,” said the butterfly. 

“No,” said the Man. “If you need 
no name, you should not have one. 
How can I serve you in a manner 
that suits your need?” 

“I do not know. I came to the Nest 
to call you because the flying hive 
was a blank in my knowing of the 
now-moment. Perhaps I expected you 
to destroy the hive, or cause it to go 
elsewhere. But the hive is your con- 
trivance, and this is your world. Thus 
I have nothing to ask.” 

“This is your world, butterfly,” 
contradicted the Man. “Long ago, 
men gave it to you and left. I’m be- 
ginning to realize why they went 
away, even though there must be 


104 


IF 




many mountains such as this on which 
men could live in comfort. We too 
must depart soon, for the same rea- 
son. And we will take our flying hive 
with us,” 

*The seasons of this world are not 
suited,” the butterfly quoted, ‘‘for be- 
ings who live a hundred years.” 

“That is a minor problem,” the 
man said. “Men are not as long-lived 
as you believe. Our hundred years, or 
season cycles, are very brief years 
compared to your own. This planet 
turns much more slowly on its axis 
and takes much longer to circle its 
sun than the planet that gave birth 
to both our species. Also, this planet’s 
orbit is far more eccentric than that 
of our birth-planet, giving you brief, 
warm summers and very long; cold 
winters. Men restructured you gen- 
etically to fit in this environment as 
intelligent life. The ancient geneticists 
must have chosen you for this world 
because you metemorphose. You can 
survive the winter as a pupa or, in 
the case of spiders and some of the 
other insects, as an egg. That was long 
ago, according to the way man expe- 
riences time. We have lost all rec- 
ords of having populated this planet. 
Before our flying hive leaves, there 
is much about your life cycles we 
would like to re-leam.” 

“It will please us to tell you,” said 
the butterfly. “There is a spider at 
my hunting ground who, I am cer- 
tain, will delight in tall^g to you 
for a whole day.” The butterfly was 
somewhat puzzled by the workings of 
the Man’s mind. Evidently the Man 
had started to tell him the reason why 
the Men who had shaped the crea- 
tures had not stayed, and why now 


these Men would have to d^art 
quickly. However, the Man had stray- 
ed from the subject. But perhaps tte 
butterfly knew the reason without be- 
ing told. 

“Now that we know what the fly- 
ing hive is,“ he said, “its blankness is 
far less disturbing. It is quite toler- 
able, in fact. You need not go quickly 
on that account.” 

“That is not why we must leave,” 
said the Man. “If it were, we could 
solve our problem quite easily by al- 
lowing you to enter the flying hive 
and investigate its contents until it 
ceased to be a blank. You may do 
that, anyway, for that matter.” 

“Then why must you go?” the 
butterfly asked. 

The Man replied hesitantly. “Be- 
cause it may not be good for men 
to associate too much with you. Not 
bad for you, but bad for men. Tell 
me, butterfly, do you know that on 
the birth-planet men regarded you as 
the most beautiful creature in exis- 
tence?” 

“No.” 

“Neither did I — since I had nev- 
er seen a butterfly until today. Nor 
even a picture of one. That is the 
reason for the incidents earlier this 
morning. I wish to apologize for not 
recognizing you and the ants and 
bees.” 

“That’s all right,” replied the but- 
terfly. “We didn’t recognize you 
either.” 

“Anyway, you are the most beauti- 
ful creature that I’ve ever seen on 
any world, excepting of course cer- 
tain females of my own kind,” the 
Man went on. “And in your mu- 
tated form, which has increased your 

IP 


106 



size and given you a unique intelli- 
gence^ you impress us as being — 
totally admirable. Man sees no other 
creature that way. And ^at men ad- 
mire, they try to imitate in them- 
selves.” 

He hesitated then finished hurried- 
ly and almost angrily: *'lf men stay- 
ed here, they would wind up being 
fake butterflies, trying to look and 
think like you when they can do 
neither. It’s best for us to stay away 
from your world and continue being 
men, whatever that may be.” 


T he butterfly found this speech 
astonishing to the point of in- 
comprehensibility, the final words no 
less than what came before. “But you 
made us as we are,” he protested. 
“Surely you know your superiority to 
us.” 

“No.” 

“You do not know the now-mo- 
ment,” the butterfly persisted, “but 
isn’t that for a reason s imily to my 
not remembering in the manner of the - 
spider? 'The thought comes to nw 
that perhaps you combine remem- 
bering and knowing in a way I can- 
not comprehend, to know all mo- 


I ' ■ ' * ( I ' ' ' f ‘ ■ ' * ■ ■ ' 

ments that have been dr will be.” 


The man made a sound signifying 
aniusement. “That is a flattering 
thought. It attributes to us the su- 
preme knowledge we sometimes im- 
agine in our own gods — the hypo- 
thetical beings who created all life. 
No, we don’t have that kind of know- 
ing. And the fact that you have part 
of it is a reason why men must avoid 
you. They would tend to consider 
you half-gods.” 

This, to the butterfly, was mon- 
strous. “But surely you must have 
some form of knowing ...” he be- 
gan. 

The Man was shaking his head. 
“Men have seen much and learned 
much. And we know much. But not 
as you know.” 

Suddenly the butterfly understood 
and gazed at the Man with awe. To 
know the now-moment, he realized 
dimly, was a complete thing, and what 
was complete w^ limited to its total- 
ity. Man’s knowing had no complete- 
ness — no limits — because Man 
did not even know himself. 

, Breathing hard in the thin moun- 
tain air, the butterfly marveled at the 
boundless wonder of Man. END

THE CREATURES OF MAN 


107 








CONCLUSION 


IF * Serial 



No one could winkle Muller 
out of his maze — buf worlds 
would crumble if they failedi 


WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 


On the planet Lemnos is the 
abandoned city, millions of years old, 
of a long-vanished alien race. The 
city is in the form of an eight-zoned 
maze, and the outer zones of the 
maze are studded with boobytraps 
so ingenious that only one human 


being has ever penetrated them. He 
is Richard Muller, formerly a trou- 
bleshooter for Earth’s government, 
now a bitter self-exiled man huddling 
alone in the heart of the maze. More 
than a decade earlier, Muller went 
as man’s first ambassador to the in- 


109 



habitants of Beta Hydri IV — the 
only other intelligent aliens known to 
exist in the galaxy. Muller went 
and came home mysteriously altered 
by the Hydrans so that no member 
of his own kind could bear to be 
close to him. Those who came with- 
in range got an agonizing dose of 
Muller’s involuntary telepathic radi- 
ation. When he realized what he 
had become, Muller took refuge in 
the maze of Lenmos. 

Now Earth has need of him again. 
A ship landed on Lenmos, break- 
ing nine years of solitude for Mul- 
ler. It carries Charles Boardman, an 
elderly, crafty diplomat, and young 
Ned Rawlins, naive and ambitious. 
Rawlins, who knows very little of 
what Boardman wants Muller for, 
has been picked as the older man’s 
catspaw. His job is to get inside 
the maze, make contact with the mis- 
anthropic Muller and persuade him 
to come out. Entering the maze 
proves difficult and hazardous; but 
with the aid of a computer and a 
supply of expendable robots, they 
get inside. Boardman settles down in 
one of the middle zones; Rawlins 
goes forward, hunting for Muller; he’s 
vaguely aware that the fate of man- 
kind may depend on how well he 
carries out his assignment. 

vn 


M uller had often been alone for 
long periods. He had enough 
cubes to keep him diverted here and 
enou^ challenges surviving in this 
maze. And memories. 

He could summon remembered 
scenes from a hundred worlds. Men 


sprawled everywhere. Delta Pavonis 
VI, for example: twenty light-years 
out and rapidly going strange. They 
called the planet Loki, which struck 
Muller as a whopping misnomer, for 
Loki was agile, shrewd, slight of 
build, and the settlers on Loki, fifty 
years isolated from Earth, went in 
for a cult of artificial obesity through 
glucostatic regulation. Muller had vis- 
ited them a decade before his ill- 
starred Beta Hydri journey. He re- 
membered a warm planet, habitable 
only in a narrow temperate belt. 
Sweaty Buddhas weighing a few hun- 
dred kilograms apiece sat in stately 
meditation before thatched huts; he 
had never seen so much flesh per 
cubic meter before. The Lokites med- 
dled with their peripheral glucore- 
ceptors to induce accumulation of 
body fat. It was useless adaptation, 
unrelated to any problem of their 
environment; they simply liked to be 
huge. Muller recced arms that look- 
ed like thighs, thighs that looked like 
pillars, bellier that curved and re- 
curved in triumphant excess. 

They had hospitably offered the 
spy from Earth a woman. For Mul- 
ler it was a lesson in cultural rela- 
tivity; for there were in the village 
two or three women who, although 
bulky enough, were scrawny by local 
standards and so approximated the 
norm of Muller’s own background. 
The Lokites did not give him any of 
these women, these pitiful underde- 
veloped hundred-kilogram wrecks, 
for it would have been a breach of 
manners to let a guest have a sub- 
par companion. So they treated him 
instead to a blonde colossus with 
breasts like cannonballs and buttocks 


110 


IF 



that were continents of quivering 
meat. 

It was, at any rate, unforgettable. 

There were so many other worlds. 
He had been a tireless voyager. He 
had shivered in methane lakes, had 
fried in post-Saharan deserts, had fol- 
lowed nomadic settlers across a pur- 
ple plain in quest of their strayed 
arthropodic cattle. He had been ship- 
wrecked by computer failure on air- 
less worlds. He had seen the coppery 
cliffs of Damballa, ninety kilome- 
ters high. He had taken a swim in 
the gravity lake of Mordred. He had 
slept beside a multicolored brook un- 
der a sky blazing with a trio of suns. 
He had walked the crystal bridges of 
Procyon XIV. He had few regrets. 

Now, huddled at the heart of his 
maze, he watched the screens and 
waited for the stranger to find him. 
A weapon, small and cool, nestled in 
his hand. 

T he afternoon unrolled swiftly. 

Rawlins began to think he would 
have done better to listen to Board- 
man and spend a night in camp be- 
fore going to seek Muller. At least 
three hours of deepsleep to comb his 
mind of tension — a quick dip un- 
der the sleep wire, always useful. 
Well, he hadn’t bothered. Now there 
was no opportunity. His sensors told 
him that Muller was jiist ahead. 

He had never done anything sig- 
nificant before. He had studied, he 
had performed routine tasks in 
Boardman’s office, he had now and 
then handled a slightly sensitive mat- 
ter. But he had always believed that 
his real career still was yet to open, 
that all this was preliminary. But this 


was no training simulation. Here he 
stood, tall and blond and young and 
stubborn and ambitious, at the 
verge of an action which — and 
Charles Boardman had not been al- 
together hypocritical about that — 
might well influence the course of 
coming history. 

Ping. 

He looked about. The sensors had 
spoken. Out of the shadows ahead 
emerged the figure of a man. Muller. 
They faced each other across a gap 
of twenty meters. Rawlins had re- 
membered Muller as a giant and was 
surprised to see now that they were 
about the same height, both of them 
just over two meters high. Muller 
was dressed in a dark glossy wrap, 
and in this light at this hour his 
face w^ a study in conflicting planes 
and jutting prominences, all peaks 
and valleys. In Muller’s hand lay 
the apple-sized device with which 
he had destroyed the probe. 

Boardman’s voice buzzed in Raw- 
lin’s ear. **Get closer to him. Smile. 
Look shy and uncertain and friendly, 
and very concerned. And keep your 
hands where he can see them at all 
times.” 

Rawlins obeyed. He wondered 
when he would begin to feel the ef- 
fects of being this close to Muller. 
He found it hard to take his eyes 
from the shiny globe that rested like 
a grenade in Muller’s hand. When 
he was ten meters away he started to 
pick up the emanation from Muller. 

Muller said, **What do you — ” 
-The words came out as a raucous 
shriek. Muller stopped, cheeks flam- 
ing, and seemed to be adjusting the 
gears of his larynx. He began again. 


THE MAN IN THE MAZE 


111 



“What do you want from me?” he 
said, this time in his true voice, deep» 
crackling with suppressed rage. 

“Just to talk. Honestly. I don’t 
want to cause any trouble for you, 
Mr. Muller.” 

“You know me!” 

“Of course I do. Everyone knows 
Richard Muller. I mean, you were 
the galactic hero when 1 was going 
to school. We did reports on you. Es- 
says about you. We — ” 

“Get out of here!” The shriek 
again. 

“ — and Stephen Rawlins was 
my father. I knew you, Mr. Muller.” 

T he dark apple was rising. The 
small square window was facing 
him. Rawlins remembered how the 
relay from the drone probe had sud- 
denly ceased. 

“Stephen Rawlins?” The apple de- 
scended. - 

“My father.” Rawlins’s left leg 
seemed to be turning to water. He 
was getting the outpouring from 
Muller more strongly now, as though 
it took a few minutes to tune to his 
wavelength. Now Rawlins felt the 
torrent of anguish, the sadness. “I 
met you long ago,” he said. “You 
had just come back from — let’s see, 
it was 82 Eridani, I think. You were 
all tanned and windbumed. I think 
I was eight years old, and you picked 
me up and threw me, only you were 
not used to Earthnorm gravity and 
you threw me too hard, and I hit 
the ceiling and began to cry, and you 
gave me something to make me 
stop, a little bead that changed col- 
ors.” 

Muller’s hands were limp at his 


sides. The apple had disappeared into 
his garment 

He said tautly, “What was your 
name? Fred, Ed — that’s it 
Yes. Ed. Edward ELawlins.” 

“They started calling me Ned a 
little later on.” 

Muller turned away and coughed. 
His hand slipped into his pocket 
He raised his head, and the descend- 
ing sun glittered weirdly against his 
face, staining it deep orange. He made 
a quick edgy gesture with one finger. 
“Go away, Ned. Tell your friends 
that I don’t want to be bothered. 
I’m a very sick man and I want to 
be alone.” 

“Sick?” 

“Sick with a mysterious inward rot 
of the soul. Look, Ned, you’re a fine 
handsome boy, and I love your fa- 
ther dearly, if any of this is true, 
and 1 don’t want you hanging 
around me. You’ll regret it. I don’t 
mean that as a threat, just as a state- 
ment of fact. Go away.” 

“Stand your ground,” Boardman 
told him. “Get closer. Right in where 
it hurts.” 

Rawlins took a wary step. He di- 
minished the distance between them 
by ten per cent The impact of the 
emanation seemed to double. 

He said, “Please don’t chase me 
away. Mr. Muller. I just want to be 
friendly. My father would never have 
forgiven me if he could have found 
out that I met you here, like this, and 
didn’t tiy to help you at all.” 

** Would have? Could have? What 
happened to your father?” 

“Dead. Four years ago, Rigel 
XXU. He was helping to set up a 
tightbeam network connecting the R> 

IP

i 



gel worlds. There was an amplifier 
accident. The focus was inverted; he 
got the whole beam.” 

“Jesus. He was still youngl” 

“He would have been fifty in a 
month.” 

Muller’s face softened. Some of the 
torment ebbed from the eyes. His 
lips became more mobile. It was as 
though someone else’s grief had tak- 
en him momentarily from his own. 

“Get closer to him,” Boardman 
ordered. 

A nother step, and then since Mul- 
ler did not seem to notice, 
another. Rawlins sensed heat: not 
real but psychical, a furnace-blast of 
directionless emotion. He shivered in 
awe. 

Muller said, “What are you doing 
on Lemnos, boy?” 

“I’m an archeologist.” The lie 
came awkwardly. “This is my first 
field trip. We’re trying to carry out a 
thorough examination of the maze.” 
“The maze happens to be some- 
one’s home. You’re intruding.” 
Rawlins faltered. 

‘Tell him you didn’t know he was 
here,” Boardman prompted. 

“We didn’t realize that anyone was 
here,” said Rawlins. “We had no way 
of knowing that — ” 

“You sent your damned robots in, 
didn’t you? Once you found someone 
here — someone you knew damned 
well wouldn’t want any company — ** 
“I don’t understand,” Rawlins 
said. “We had the impression you 
were wrecked here. We wanted to of- 
fer our help.” 

How easily I do this, he told him- 
selfl 

THE MAN IN THE MAZE 


Muller scowled. “You don’t know 
why I’m here?” 

“I’m afraid not.” 

“You wouldn’t, I guess. You were 
too young. But the others — once 
they saw my face, they should have 
known. Why didn’t they tell you?” 

“I really don’t understand — ” 
“Come close!” Muller bellowed. 
Rawlins felt himself gliding for- 
ward. Abruptly he was face to face 
with Muller, conscious of the man’s 
massive frame, his furrowed brow, 
his fixed, staring, angry eyes. Mul- 
ler’s immense hand poimced on Raw- 
lins’s wrist. Rawlins rocked, stunned 
by the impact, drenched with a de- 
spair so vast that it seemed to engulf 
whole universes. He tried not to stag- 
ger. 

“Now get away from me!” Mul- 
led cried harshly. “Go on! Out of 
here! Out!” 

Rawlins did not move. 

Muller howled a curse and ran 
ponderously into a low glassy-walled 
building. The door closed, sealing 
without a perceptible opening. Raw- 
lins sucked in breath and fougbt for 
his balance. 

“Stay where you are,” said Board- 
man. “Let him get over his tantrum. 
Everything’s going well.” 

vm 

M uller crouched behind the door. 

Sweat rolled down his sides. A 
dhill swept him. He wrapped his arms 
about himself so tightly that his ribs 
complained. 

He had not meant to handle the 
intruder that way at all. 

A few words of conversation, a

blunt request for privacy; then, if 
the man would not go away, the de- 
structor globe. So Muller had plan- 
ned. But he had hesitated. He had 
spoken too much and learned too 
much. Stephen Rawlim’s son? A 
party of archeologists out there? The 
boy had hardly seemed affected by 
the radiation, except at very close 
range. Was it losing its power with 
the years? 

Muller fought to collect himself 
and to analyze his hostility. Why so 
fearful? Why so eager to cling to sol- 
itude? He had nothing to fear from 
Earthmen; they and not he were 
the sufferers in any contact he had 
with them. His original pretense was 
that he had come here out of consid- 
eration for his fellow man, that he 
was unwilling to inflict the painful 
ugliness that was himself upon them. 
But the boy had wanted to be friend- 
ly and helpful. Why flee? 

Slowly Muller rose and undid the 
door. He stepped outside. Night had 
fallen with winter’s swiftness; the sky 
was black, and the moons seared 
across it The boy still stood in the 
plaza, looking a little dazed. The big- 
gest moon, Clotho, bathed him in 
golden light, so that his curling hair 
seemed to sparkle with inner flame. 
His face was very pale, with sharply 
accentuated cheekbones. His blue eyes 
gleamed in shock. 

Muller felt like some great half- 
rusted machine called into action af- 
ter too many years of neglect. “Ned?” 
he said. “Look, Ned, 1 want to tell 
you that Fm sorry. You*ve got to un- 
derstand, I’m not used to people. Not 
— used — to — people'* 

“It’s all right, Mr. Muller. I real- 


ize it’s been rough for you.” 
“Call me Dick.” Muller raised both 
hands and spread them as if trying 
to cup moonbeams. On the wall be- 
yond the plaza small animal shapes 
leaped and danced. Muller said, “I’ve 
come to love my privacy. You can 
even cherish cancer if you get into 
the right frame of mind. Look, you 
ought to realize something. I came 
here deliberately. It wasn’t any ship- 
wreck. I picked out the one place 
in the universe where I was least 
likely to be disturbed and hid myself 
inside it. But of course you had to 
come with your tricky robots and 
find the way in.” 

“If you don’t want me here. I’ll 
go,” Rawlins said. 

“Maybe that’s best for both of us. 
No. Wait. Stay. Is it very bad, being 
this close to me?” 

“It isn’t exactly comfortable,” said 
Rawlins. “But it isn’t as bad as — 
as — well, I don’t know. From this 
distance I just feel a little depressed.” 
“You know why?” Muller asked. 
“From the way you talk, I think you 
do, Ned. You’re only pretending not 
to know what happened to me on 
Beta Hydri IV.” 

R awlins colored. “Well, I remem- 
ber a little bit, I guess. They op- 
erated on your mind?” 

“Yes, that’s right. What you’re 
feeling, Ned, that’s me, my goddamn 
soul leaking into the air. You’re pick- 
ing up the flow of neural current, 
straight from the top of my skull. 
Isn’t it lovely? Try coming a little 
closer. That’s it.” Rawlins halted. 
^ “There,” Muller said. “Now it’s 
' stronger. You’re getting a better dose. 


114 


IF 



Now recall what it was like when you 
were standing right here. That wasn’t 
so pleasant, was it? From ten meters 
away you can take it. From one me- 
ter away it’s intolerable. Can you im- 
agine holding a woman in your arms 
while you give off a mental stink like 
that? You can’t make love from ten 
meters away.” Muller said, “Let’s sit 
down, Ned. It’s safe here. I’ve got de- 
tectors rigged in case any of the 
nastier animals come in, and there 
aren’t any traps in this zone. Sit.” He 
lowered himself to the smooth milky- 
white stone floor, the alien marble 
that made this plaza so sleek. Raw- 
lins, after an instant of deliberation, 
slipped lithely into the lotus position 
a dozen meters away. 

Muller said, “How old are you, 
Ned?” 

‘Twenty-three.” 

“Married?” 

A shy grin. “Afraid not.” 

“Got a girl?” 

“There was one, a liaison contract. 
We voided it when I took on this 
job.” ” 

“How many men have you lost 
here so far?” Muller asked. 

“Five, I think. Fd like to know 
the sort of people who’d build a 
thing like this.” 

Muller said, “This was the grand 
creative triumph of their race, I be- 
lieve. Their masterpiece, their monu- 
ment. They must have been proud of 
this murderous place. It summed up 
the whole essence of their philosophy: 
kill the stranger.” 

“Are you just speculating, or have 
you found some clues to their cultur- 
al outlook?” 

“The only clue I have to their cul- 


tural outlook is all around us. But 
I’m an expert on alien psychology, 
Ned. I know more about it than any 
other human being, because I’m the 
only one who ever said hello to an 
alien race. Kill the stranger: it’s the 
law of the universe. And if you don’t 
kill him, at least screw him up a 
little.” 

“We aren’t like that,” Rawlins 
said. “We don’t show instinctiye hos- 
tility to — ” 

“Crap.” 

“But — ” 

M uller said, “If an alien starship 
ever landed on one of our plan- 
ets, we’d quarantine it and imprison 
the crew and interrogate them to de- 
struction. We pretend that we’re too 
noble to hate strangers, but we have 
the politeness of weakness. Take the 
Hydrans. A substantial faction within 
our government was in favor of gen- 
erating fusion in their cloud layer 
and giving them an extra sun. Before 
sending an emissary to scout them.” 
“No.” 

“They were overruled, and an em- 
issary was sent, and the Hydrans 
wasted him. Me.” An idea struck 
Muller suddenly. Appalled, he said, 
“What’s happened between us and 
the Hydrans in the last nine years? 
Any contact? War?” 

“Nothing,” said Rawlins. “We’ve 
kept away.” 

“Are you telling me the truth? Or 
did we wipe the bastards out? God 
knows I wouldn’t mind that, but yet 
it wasn’t their fault they did this to 
me. They were reacting in a stan- 
dard xenophobic way. Ned, has there 
been a war with them?” 


THE MAN IN THE MAZE 


115 



“No, there really hasn’t. I swear.” 
Muller relayed. After a moment 
he said, “All right. I won’t aric you 
to fill me in on all the other news de- 
velopments. 1 dWt really give a damn. 
How long are you people staying on 
Lemnos?” 

“We don’t know yet. A few weeks, 
I suppose. We haven’t even really 
begun to explore the maze. And then 
there’s the area outside. We want to 
run correlations on the work of earli- 
er archeologists, and — ” 

“Are the others going to come into 
the center of the maze?” 

Rawlins moistened his lips. “We 
don’t have any plan yet. It ah de- 
pends on you. We don’t want to im- 
pose on you. So if you don’t want us 
to work here — ” 

“I don’t,” Muiier said crisply. “Tell 
that to your friends. In fifty or sixty 
years I’ll be dead, and they can sniff 
around here then. But while Fm here 
I don’t want them bothering me. Let 
them work in the outer four or five 
zones. If any of them sets foot in A, 
B or C, I’ll kill him.” 

“What about me? Am I welcome?” 
“Occasionally. I can’t predict my 
moods. If you want to talk to me, 
come around and see. And if I tell 
you to get the hell out, Ned, then get 
the hell out. Clear?” 

Rawlins grinned sunnily. “Clear.” 
He got to his feet. Muller, unwilling 
to have the boy standing over him, 
rose also. Rawlins took a few steps 
toward him. 

Muller said, “Where are you 
going?” 

“I hate having to talk at this dis- 
tance. To shout like this. I can get a 
little closer to you, can’t I?” 


Instantly suspicious, Muller re- 
plied, “Are you some kind of maso- 
chist?” 

“Sorry, no.” 

“Well, I’m no sadist, either. I dotfl 
want you near me.” 

“It’s really not that unpleasant — 
Dick.” 

“You’re lying. You hate it like all 
the others. I’m like a leper, boy, and 
if you’re queer for leprosy I feel 
sorry for you, but don’t come any 
closer. It embarrasses me to see other 
people suffer on my account.” 
Rawlins stopped. “Whatever you 
say. Look, Dick, I don’t want to 
cause troubles for you. I’m just try- 
ing to be friendly and helpful. If do- 
ing that in some way makes you un- 
comfortable, well, just say so and I’ll 
do something else.” 

“That came out pretty muddled, 
boy. What is it you want from me, 
anyhow?” 

“Nothing.” 

“Why not leave me alone?” 

“You’re a human being and you’ve 
been alone here for a long time. It’s 
my natural impulse to offer compan- 
ionship.” 

Muller shrugged. “I’m not much of 
a companion. Maybe you ought to 
take all your sweet Christian impulses 
and go away. There’s no way you can 
help me, Ned. You can only hurt me 
by reminding me of all I can no long- 
er have or know.” Stiffening, Muller 
looked past the tall young man to- 
ward the shadowy figures cavorting 
along the walls. He was hungry, and 
this was the hour to begin hunting 
for his dinner. He said brusquely, 
“Son, I think my patience is running 
out. Leave.” 


116 


IF 



“All right. Can I come back to- 
morrow?” 

“Maybe.” 

The boy smiled ingenuously. 
“Thanks for letting me talk to you, 
Dick. I’ll be back.” 

B y troublesome moonlight Rawlins 
made his way out of Zone A. 
He edged over a spring-loaded stone 
block that was capable of hurling 
him from a precipice if he applied 
his weight the wrong way. A small 
toothy animal snickered at him as he 
crossed. On the far side Rawlins 
prodded the wall in a yielding place 
and won admission to Zone B. 

Rawlins still throbbed with the 
impact of that brief moment of direct 
contact with Muller. For an instant 
he had received a formless incoherent 
emanation of raw emotion, the inner 
self spilling out involuntarily and 
wordlessly. The flow of uncontrol- 
lable innerness was painful and de- 
pressing to receive. 

It was not true telepathy that the 
Hydrans had given him . Muller 
could not “read” minds, nor could 
he communicate his thoughts to oth- 
ers. What came forth was this gush 
of self. A torrent of raw despair, a 
river of regrets and sorrows, all the 
sewage of a soul. He could not hold 
it back. For that eternal moment 
Rawlins had been bathed in it; the 
rest of the time he had merely picked 
up a vague and general sense of 
distress. Rawlins had felt that he was 
tuned to every discord in creation: 
the missed chances, the failed loves, 
the hasty words, the unfair griefs, the 
hungers, the greeds, the lusts, the 
knife of envy, the acid of frustration. 


the fang of time, the death of small 
insects in winter, the tears of things. 
He had known aging, loss, mortality, 
impotence, fury, helplessness, lone- 
liness, desolation, self-contempt, and 
madness. It was a silent shriek of 
cosmic anger. 

Are we all like that, he wondered? 
Is the same broadcast coming from 
me, and from Boardman, and from 
my mother, and from the girl I used 
to love? Do we walk about like bea- 
cons fixed to a frequency we can’t re- 
ceive? Thank God, then. That’s a 
song too painful to hear. 

Boardman said, “Wake up, Ned. 
Stop brooding and watch out for trou- 
ble. You’re almost in Zone C now.” 
“Charles, how did you feel the 
first time you came close to Muller?” 
“We’ll discuss that later.” 

“Did you feel as if you knew what 
human beings were all about for the 
first time?” 

“I said we’d discuss — ” 

“Let me say what I want to say, 
Charles. I’m not in any danger here. 
I just looked into a man’s soul, and 
I’m shaken by it. But — listen, 
Charles — he isn’t really like that 
He’s a good man. That stuff he ra- 
diates, it’s just noise, it’s a kind of 
sludge that doesn’t tell you a real 
thing about Dick Muller.” 

**Ned. Get back to camp. We all 
agree that Dick Muller’s a fine human 
being. That’s why we need him.” 

IX 

W hen they met again the next 
morning it was easier for both 
of them. Rawlins, having slept well 
under the sleep wire, went to the

heart of the maze and found Muller 
standing beside a tall flat-sided spike 
of dark metal at the edge of the great 
plaza. 

“What do you make of this?” Mul- 
ler asked conversationally as Raw- 
lins approached. “There are eight of 
them» one at each comer. I’ve been 
watching them for years. They turn. 
Look here.” Muller pointed to one 
face of the pylon. Rawlins came close, 
and when he was ten meters away 
he picked up Muller’s emanation. 
Nevertheless he forced himself closer. 

“You see this?” Muller asked, tap- 
ping the spike. 

“A mark.” 

“It took ^e close to six months to 
cut it. I used a sliver from the crys- 
tahine outcropping set in that wall 
yonder. Every day for an hour or two 
I’d scrape away, until there was a visi- 
ble mark in the metal. I’ve been 
watching that mark. In the course of 
one local year it turns all the way 
round. So the spikes are moving. 
You can’t see it, but they move. They 
are some kind of calendars.” 

“Do — they — can — have you 
ever — 

“You aren’t making sense, boy.” 

‘Tm sorry.” Rawlins backed away, 
trying hard to hide the impact of 
Mtdler’s nearness. He was flushed and 
shaken. At five meters the effect was 
not so agonizing, and he stayed 
there making an effort, telling him- 
self that he was developing a toler- 
ance for it. 

“You were saying?” 

“Is this the only one you’ve been 
watching?” 

‘Tve scratched a few of the others. 
I’m convinced that they all turn. I 


haven’t found the mechanism. Un- 
derneath this city, you know, there’s 
some kind of fantastic brain. It’s mil- 
lions of years old, but it still works, 
so it’s probably some sort of liquid 
metal with cognition elements float- 
ing in it. It turns these pylons and 
runs the water supply and cleans the 
streets.” 

“And operates the traps.” 

“And operates the traps,” Muller 
said. “But I haven’t been able to find 
a sign of it. I’ve done some digging 
here and there, but I find only dirt 
below. Maybe you archeologist bas- 
tards will locate the city’s brain. Eh? 
Any clues?” 

“I don’t think so,” said Rawlins. 
“Most of the time I go outside the 
city, directing the entry operations. 
And then when I got in, I came right 
in here. So I don’t know what the 
others may have discovered so far. 
If anything.” 

“Are they going to rip up the 
streets?” M^er asked. 

“I don’t think so. We don’t dig so 
much, any more. We use scanners 
and sensors and probe beams.” Glib- 
ly, impressed with his own improvisa- 
tions, he went on headlong. “Arche- 
ology used to be destructive, of 
course. To find out what was under a 
pyramid we had to take the pyramid 
apart. But now we can do a lot with 
probes. That’s the new school, you 
understand, looking into the ground 
without digging, and thus preserving 
the monuments of the past for — ” 

“On one of the planets of Epsilon 
Indi,” said Muller, “a team of arche- 
ologists completely dismantled an an- 
cient alien burial pavilion about fif- 
teen years ago, and then found it im-

possible to put the thing back together 
because they couldn’t comprehend 
the structural integrity of the building. 
When they tried> it fell apart and was 
a total loss. 1 happened to see the 
ruins a few months later. You know 
the case, of course.” 

Rawlins didn’t. He said, reddening, 
“Well there are always bunglers in 
any discipline — ” 

hope there are none here. 1 don’t 
want the maze damaged. Not that 
there’s much chance of that. The 
maze defends itself quite well.” Mul- 
led strolled casually away from the 
pylon. He said, half to himself, 
“The cages are closed again.” 
“Cages?” 

“Look down there. Into that street 
branching out of the plaza.” 

R awlins saw an alcove against a 
building wall. Rising from the 
ground were a dozen or more curving 
bars of white stone that disappeared 
into the wall at a height of about four 
meters, forming a kind of cage. He 
could see a second such cage farther 
down the street. 

Muller said, *There are about 
twenty of them arranged symmetrical- 
ly in the streets off &e plaza. Three 
times since I’ve been here the cages 
have opened. Those bars slide into the 
street, somehow, and disappear. The 
third time was two ni^ts ago. I’ve 
never seen the cages either open or 
close, and I’ve missed it again.” 
“\^at do you think the cages were 
used for?” Rawlins asked. 

’To hold dangerous beasts. Or cap- 
tured enemies.” 

“And when they open now — ” 
“The city’s still trying to serve its 


people. There are enemies in the 
outer zones. The cages are ready in 
case any of the enemies are cap- 
tured.” 

“You mean us?” 

“Yes. Enemies.” Muller’s eyes glit- 
tered with sudden paranoid fury; it 
was alarming how easily he slipped 
from rational discourse to that cold 
blaze. ‘*Homo sapiens. The most 
dangerous, the most ruthless, the most 
despicable beast in the universet” 
“You say it as if you believe it.” 

“I do.” 

“Come on,” Rawlins said. “You 
devoted your life to serving mankind. 
You can’t possibly believe — ” 

“I devoted my life,” said Muller 
slowly, “to serving Richard Muller.” 
He swung around so that he faced 
Rawlins squarely. They were only six 
or seven meters apart. The emanation 
seemed almost as strong as though 
they were nose to nose. Muller said, 
“I gave less of a damn for humanity 
than you might think, boy. 1 saw the 
stars and 1 wanted them. 1 aspired 
after the condition of a deity. One 
world wasn’t enough for me; I was 
hungry to have them all. So 1 built 
a career that would take me to the 
stars. I risked my life a thousand 
times. 1 endured fantastic extremes of 
temperature. I rotted my lungs with 
crazy gases and had to be rebuilt 
from the inside out. 1 ate foods that 
would sicken you to hear about. Kids 
like you worshiped me and wrote es- 
says about my selfless dedication to 
man, my tireless quest for knowl- 
edge. Let me get you straight on that. 
I’m about as selfless as Columbus and 
Magellan and Marco Polo. They were 
great explorers, yes, but they also 

119 


THE AUN IN THE MAZE 



looked for a fat profit. The profit I 
wanted was in here. I wanted to 
stand a hundred kilometers high. 1 
wanted golden statues of me on a 
thousand worlds. You know poetry? 
Fame is the spur. That last infirmity 
of noble mind. Milton. Do you know 
your Greeks, too? When a man over- 
reaches himself, the gods cast him 
down. It’s called hybris, 1 had a bad 
case of it. When I dropped through 
the clouds to vissit the Hydrans, 1 felt 
like a god. Christ, 1 was a god. And 
when I left, up through the clouds 
again. To the Hydrans I’m a god, all 
right. 1 thought it then: I’m in their 
myths, they’ll always tell my story.” 

“The cage — ” 

“Let me finish,” Muller rapped. 
“You see, the truth is, I wasn’t a 
god, only a rotten mortal human be- 
ing who had delusions of godhood, 
and the real gods saw to it that 1 
learned my lesson. They decided to 
remind me of the hairy beast inside 
the plastic clothing. So they arranged 
it for the Hydrans to perform a clev- 
er little surgical trick on my brain, 
one of their specialties, 1 guess. 1 
don’t know if the Hydrans were being 
malicious for the hell of it or whether 
they were genuinely trying to cure 
me of a defect, my inability to let 
my emotions get out to them. But 
they did their little job. And then I 
came back to Earth. Hero and leper 
all at once. Stand near me and you 
get sick. Why? It reminds you that 
you*re an animal, too, because you 
get a full dose of me. So we go round 
and round in our endless feedback. 
You hate me because you leam 
things about your own soul by get- 
ting near me. And I hate you because 


you must draw back from me. What 
1 am, you see, is a plague carrier, 
and the plaque I carry is the truth. 
My message is that it’s a lucky thing 
for humanity that we’re shut up each 
in our own skulls, because if we had 
even a little drop of telepathy, even 
the blurry non-verbal thing I’ve got, 
we’d be unable to stand each other. 
The Hydrans can reach right into 
each other’s minds, and they seem to 
like it, but we can’t. And that’s why 
I say that man must be the most de- 
spicable beast in the whole universe. 
He can’t even take the reek of his 
own kind, soul to soull” 

Rawlins said, "The cage seems to 
be opening.” 

44TT^hat? Let me look!” Muller 
Vy came jostling forward. Un- 
able to step aside rapidly enough, 
Rawlins received the brunt of the em- 
anation. It was not as painful this 
time. Images of autumn came to him: 
withered leaves, dying flowers, a 
dusty wind, early twilight More re- 
gret than anguish over the shortness 
of life, the necessity of the condition. 

“It’s withdrawn by several centime- 
ters already. Why didn’t you tell 
me?” 

“I tried to. But you weren’t lis- 
tening.” 

“No. No. My damned soliloquiz- 
ing.” Muller chuckled. “Ned, I’ve 
been waiting years to see this. The 
cage actually in motion. Look how 
smoothly it moves, gliding into the 
ground. This is strange, Ned. It’s nev- 
er opened twice the same year be- 
fore, and here’s it’s opening for the sec- 
ond time this week.” 

The cage was fully open now. 

IP 


120 



There was no sign of the bars except 
the row of small openings in the 
pavement. 

Rawlins said, “Have you ever tried 
to put anything in the cages? Ani- 
mals?” 

“Yes. I dragged a big dead beast 
inside one. Nothing happened. Then I 
caught some live little ones. Nothing 
happened.” He frowned. I once 
thought of stepping into the cage 
myself to see if it would close auto- 
matically when it sensed a live human 
being. But I didn’t. When you’re 
alone you don’t try experiments like 
that.” He paused a moment. “How 
would you like to help me in a little 
experiment right now, eh, Ned? Just 
step across into the alcove and wait 
a minute or so. See if the cage closes 
on you,” 

“And if it does,” Rawlins said, 
not taking him seriously, “do you 
have a key to let me out?” 

“I have a few weapons. We can 
always blast you out by lasing the 
bars.” 

“That’s destructive. You warned 
me not to destroy anything here.” 

“Sometimes you destroy in order 
to learn. Go on, Ned. Step in.” 

Muller’s voice grew flat and 
strange. He was standing in an odd 
expectant half-crouch, hands at his 
sides, fingertips bent inward toward 
his thighs. As though he’s going to 
throw me into the cage himself, 
Rawlins thought. 

Boardman said quietly in Raw- 
lin’s ear, “Do as he says, Ned. Get 
into the cage. Show him that you 
trust him.” 

I trust him, Rawlins told himself. 
But I don’t trust that cage. 


He had uncomfortable visions of 
the floor of the cage dropping out 
as soon as the bars were in placed Of 
himself dumped into some under- 
ground vat of acid or lake of fife. 
The disposal pit for trapped enemies. 

“Do it, Ned,” Boardman mur- 
mured. 

I t was a grand crazy gesture. Raw- 
lins stepped over the row of 
small openings and stood with his 
back to the wall. Almost at once the 
curving bars rose from the groimd 
and locked themselves seamlessly in- 
to place above his head. The floor 
seemed stable. No death-rays lashed 
out at him. 

“Fascinating,” Muller said. “It 
must scan for intelligence. When I 
tried with animals, nothing happened. 
Dead or alive. What do you make of 
that, Ned?” 

‘Tm very glad to have your re- 
search. I’d be happier if you’d let me 
out now.” 

“I can’t control the movements of 
the bars.” 

“You said you’d laser them open.” 
“But why be destructive so fast? 
Let’s wait, shall we? Perhaps the b^s 
will open again of their own accord. 
You’re perfectly safe in there, til 
bring you food, if you have to eat/’ 
“Stay cool,” Boardman advised. 
‘Tf necessary, we can get you out of 
that ourselves. It’s important to hu- 
mor Muller in everything you can 
until you’ve got real rapport widi 
him.” 

Muller said, “That was pretty 
brave of you, Ned. Or stupid. I’m 
sometimes not sure if there’s a di^ 
tinction. But I’m grateful, anyway. I 

121 


THE AAAN IN THE MAZE 



had to know about those cages.” 

“Glad to have been of assistance. 
You see^ human beings aren’t all 
that monstrous.” 

“Not consciously. It’s the sludge 
inside that’s ugly, Rawlins.” He sat 
down crosslegged. 

“Did you make any attempt at 
all to get yourself fixed when you 
returned to Earth?” 

“1 talked to the shapeup boys. 
They couldn’t begin to figure out 
what changes had been made in my 
neural flow, and so they couldn’t be- 
gin to figure out how to fix things.” 

“How long did you stay?” 

“A few months. Long enough to 
discover that there wasn’t one human 
being 1 knew who didn’t turn green 
after a few minutes of close expo- 
sure to me. 1 tried some fancy drugs, 
and then 1 tried drink, and then 1 
tried living dangerously. And at the 
end of it 1 was still alive. 1 was in 
and out of four neuropsychiatric 
wards in a single month. 1 tried 
wearing a padded lead helmet to 
shield the thought radiations. It was 
like trying to catch neutrinos in a 
bucket,” Muller spat. “You know, I 
could always take society or leave iU 
When I was among people I was 
happy. I was cordial; 1 had the social 
graces. I wasn’t a slick, sunny ar- 
ticle like you, all overflowing with 
kindness and nobility, but 1 inter- 
acted with others, 1 related, 1 got 
along. Then 1 could go on a trip for 
a year and a half and not see or 
speak to anyone, and that was all 
right too. But once 1 found out that 
1 was shut off from society for good, 
1 discovered that 1 had needed it af- 
ter all. But that’s over. I outgrew the 


ne^, boy. 1 can spend a hundred 
years alone and never miss one souL 
1 trained myself to see humanity as 
humanity sees me: something sid^en- 
ing, a damp hunkering crippled thing 
avoid^ To heU with you aU. I 
don’t owe any of you anything, love 
included. 1 have no obligations. 1 
could leave you to rot in that cage» 
Ned, and never feel upset about it. 
1 could pass that cage twice a day 
and smile at your skull.” 

“You speak as if you belong to an 
alien race,” Rawlins said in wonder. 

“No. 1 belong to the human race. 
I’m the most human being there is, 
because Tm the only one who can’t 
hide his humanity. What’s inside me 
is also inside you. I speak for man I 
tell the truth. I’m the skull beneath 
the face, boy. I’m the hidden intes- 
tines. I’m ail the garbage we pre- 
tend isn’t there, all the filthy animal 
stuff, the lusts, the little hates, the 
sicknesses, the envies.” 

Rawlins said quietly, “Why did you 
decide to come to Lemnos?” 

“A man named Charles Boardman 
put the idea into my head.” 

X 

R ’awlins recoiled in surprise at the 
mention of the name. 

Muller said, “You know him?” 
‘Well, yes. Of course. He — he’s 
a , very important man in the govern- 
ment” 

“It was Boardman who sent me to 
Beta Hydri IV. Oh, he didn’t trick 
me into it, he didn’t have ^ to per- 
suade me in any of his slippery ways. 
He simply played on my ambitions. 
There’s a world there with aliens on 


122 


IF 



iU he said, and we want a man to 
visit it Probably a suicide mission, 
but it would be man^s first contact 
with another intelligent species, and 
are you interested? So of Course 1 
went. And afterward, when 1 came 
back this way, he tried to duck me a 
while, either because he couldnH 
abide being near me or because he 
couldn’t abide his own guilt, and fi^ 
nally 1 caught up with him and 1 
said, look at me, Charles, this is how 
1 am now, where can 1 go, what shall 
1 do? 1 got close to him. His face 
changed color. 1 could see the nausea 
in his eyes. And he reminded me 
about the maze on Lemnos.*’ 

“Why?” 

“He offered it as a place to hide. 
I suppose he thought I’d be killed on 
my way into the maze. But I told 
Boardman I wouldn’t think of it 1 
wanted to cover my trail. 1 blew up 
and insisted that the last thing in the 
world I’d do was come here. Then 
I spent the month on skids in Under 
New Orleans, and when 1 surfaced 
again I rented a ship and came here, 
using maximum diversionary tac- 
tics to insure that nobody found out 
my true destination.” 

Rawlins said, “How did you get 
inside the maze?” 

“Through sheer bad luck.” 

“Bad luckr 

“I was trying to die in a blaze of 
glory,” said Muller. ”I didn’t give a 
damn if 1 survived the maze or not. 
I just plunged right in and headed 
for the middle. The trouble was, Ned, 
I’m a survival type. It’s an innate 
gift, maybe even something paranor^ 
mat. 1 have unusual reflexes. Also 
my urge to stay alive is well de- 


veloped. Besides that, I had mass 
detectors and some other useful 
equipment. So I came into the maze, 
and whenever I saw a corpse lying 
about I looked a little sharper than 
usual, and I stopped and rested when 
I felt my visualization of the place 
beginning to waver. I fully expected 
to be killed in Zone H. I Wanted it. 
But it was my luck to make it where 
everybody failed.” He said, “Are you 
getting hungry, boy?” 

“A little.” 

“Don’t go away. I’ll bring you 
some lunch.” 

M uller strode toward the nearby 
buildings and disappeared. 
Rawlins said quietly, “This .is awful, 
Charles. He’s obviously out of his 
mind.” 

“Don’t be sure of it,” Boardman 
replied. “He may be playing a game 
with you, pretending to be crazy to 
test your good faith.” 

Muller returned, carrying a plat- 
ter of meat and a handsome crystal 
beaker of water. “Best I can offer,” 
he said. 

The water had an agreeable flavor, 
or lack of flavor. Muller sat quietly 
before the cage, eating. Rawlins no- 
ticed that the effect of his emanation 
no longer seemed so disturbing, even 
at a range of less than five meters. 
Obviously one builds a tolerance to 
it, he thought. , • 

Rawlins said after a while, “Would 
you come out and meet my com- 
panions in a few days?” . 

“Absolutely not.” 

“They’d be eager to talk to you.” 
“I have no interest in talking to 
them. I’d sooner talk to wild beasts.” 


THE MAN IN THE MAZE 


123 



“You talk to me,” Rawlins pointed 
out. 

“For the novelty of it. And be- 
cause your father was a good friend. 
Aud because as human beings go, 
boy, you’re reasonably acceptable. 
But I don’t want to be thrust into 
any miscellaneous mass of bug-eyed 
archeologists.” 

Possibly meet two or three of 
them,” Rawlins suggested. “Get used 
to the idea of being among people 
again.” 

"Why should I get used to the 
idea of being among people again?” 

Rawlins said uneasily, “Well, be- 
cause there are people here, be- 
cause it’s not a good idea to get too 

isolated from — ” 

• 

“Are you planning some sort of 
trick? Are you going to catch me 
and pull me out of this maze? Come 
on, come on, boy, what’s in back of 
that little mind of yours? What mo- 
tive do you have for softening me 
up for human contact?” 

Rawlins faltered. In the awkward 
silence Boardman spoke quickly, sup- 
plying the guile he lacked, prompt- 
ing him. RawUns listened and did his 
best. 

H e said, “You’re making me out 
to be a real schemer, Dick. But 
I swear to you I’ve got nothing sin- 
ister in mind. I admit I’ve been 
softening you up a little, jollying you, 
trying to make friends with you, and 
I guess I’d better tell you why.” 

“I guess you’d better.” 

It’s for the archeological survey’s 
sake. We can spend only a few weeks 
here. You’ve been here — what is it, 
nine years? You know so much about 


this place, Dick, and I t hink it’s un- 
fair of you to keep it to yourself. 
So what I was hoping, I guess, was 
that I could get you to ease up, then 
maybe come to Zone E, talk to the 
others, answer their questions, explain 
what you know about the maze — ” 
“Unfair to keep it to myself?” 
“Well, yes. To hide knowledge is a 
sin.” 

“Is it fair to mankind to call me 
unclean and run away from me?” 
“That’s a different matter,” Raw- 
lins said. “It’s beyond all fairness. It’s 
a condition you have, an unfortun- 
ate condition that you didn’t deserve, 
and everyone is quite sorry that it 
came upon you, but on the other 
hand you surely must realize that 
from the viewpoint of other human 
beings it’s rather difficult to take a 
detached attitude toward your — ■ 
your — ” 

“Toward my stink,” Muller sup- 
plied. “All right. It’s rather difficult 
to stand my presence. Therefore I 
willingly refrain from inflicting it up- 
on your friends. Get it out of your 
head that I’m going to speak to them 
or sip tea with them or have any- 
thing at all to do with them. I have 
separated myself from the human 
race and I stay separated, and it’s 
irrelevant that I’ve granted you the 
privilege of bothering me.” 

Boardman continued to instruct 
him. Rawlins, with the sour taste of 
lies on his tongue, went on, “I can’t 
blame you for being bitter, Dick. But 
I still think it isn’t right for you to 
withhold information from us. I 
mean, look back on your exploring 
days. If you landed on a planet, and 
someone had vital information you 

IF 


124 



had come to find, wouldn’t you make 
every effort to get that information, 
even though the other f)erson had 
certain private problems which — 
“Fm sorry,” said Muller frostily. 
“I’m beyond caring.” 

He walked away, leaving Rawlins 
alone in the cage with two chunks of 
meat and the beaker of water, nearly 
empty. 

When Muller was out of sight 
Boardman said, “He’s a touchy one, 
all right. But I didn’t expect sweet- 
ness from him. You’re getting to him, 
Ned. You’re just the right mixture of 
guHe and naivete.” 

“And I’m in a cage.” 

“That’s no problem. We can send 
a drone to release you if the cage 
doesn’t open by itself soon.” 

, “Muller isn’t going to work out,” 
Rawlins murmured. “He’s full of 
hate. It trickles out of him every- 
where. We’ll never get him to cooper- 
ate. I’ve never seen such hate in one 
man.” 

“You don’t know what hate is,” 
said Boardman. “And neither does 
he. I tell you everything is moving 
well. There are bound to be some 
setbacks, but the fact that he’s talking 
to you at all is the important thing. 
He doesn’t want to be full of hate. 
Give him half a chance to get off his 
frozen position, and he will.” 

M uller did not return. The after- 
noon grew darker and the air 
became chilly. Rawlins huddled un- 
comfortably in the cage. He tried to 
imagine this city when it had been 
alive, when this cage had been used 
to display prisoners captured in the 
maze. In the eye of his mind he saw 


a throng of the city-builders, short 
and thick, with dense coppery fur 
and greenish skin, swinging their 
long arms and pointing toward the 
cage. And in the cage huddled a 
thing like a giant scorpion, with waxy 
claws that scratched at the stone 
paving blocks, and fiery eyes, and a 
savage tail that awaited anyone who 
came to close. Harsh music sounded 
through the city. Alien laughter. The 
warm musky reek of the city-build- 
ers. Children spitting at the thing in 
the cage. A trapped creature, hideous 
and malevolent, lonely for its own 
kind, its hive on a world of Alphec- 
ca or Markab, where waxy tailed 
things moved in shining tunnels. For 
days the city-builders came, mocked 
reproached. He grew sick of their 
massive bodies and their intertwin- 
ing spidery fingers, of their flat faces 
and ugly tusks. And a day came 
when the floor of the maze gave way, 
for they were tired of the outworlder 
captive, and down he went, tail lash- 
ing furiously, down into a pit of 
knives. 

It was night. Rawlins had not heard 
from Boardman for several hours. 
He had not seen Muller since early 
afternoon. Animals were prowling 
the plaza, mostly small ones, all teeth 
and claws. Rawlins had come unarm- 
ed today. 

Hunger and cold assailed him. He 
searched the darkness for Muller. 
This had ceased to be a joke. 

“Can you hear me?” he said to 
Boardman. 

“We’re going to get you out soon.” 

“Yes, but when?** 

“We sent a probe in, Ned.” 

“It shouldn’t take more than fif- 


THE MAN IN THE MAZE 


125 



teen minutes for a probe to reach 
me. These zones aren’t really haz- 
ardous.” 

Boardman paused. “Muller inter- 
cepted the probe and destroyed it an 
hour ago.” 

“Why didn’t you tell me that?” 

‘*We’re sending several drones at 


Boardman said. “Muller’s 


bound to overlook at least one of 
them. Everything’s perfectly all right, 
Ned. You’re in no danger.” 

“Until something happens,” Raw- 
lins said gloomily. 

Cold, hungry, he slouched against 
the wall and waited. He saw a small 
lithe beast stalk and kill a much big- 
ger animal a hundred meters away in 
the plaza. He watched scavengers 
scurrying in to rip away slabs of 
bloody meat. He craned Ws neck to 
search for the drone probe that

would set him free. No probe ap- 
peared. 

He felt like a sacrificial victim, 
staked out for the kilk 
, The scavengers had finished their 
work. They came padding across the 
plaza toward him — little weasel- 
shaped beasts with big tapering heads 
and paddle-shaped paws from which 
yellow recurving claws protruded. 
Their eyes were red in yellow fields. 
They studied him with interest, sol- 
emnly, thoughtfully. Blood, thick 
and purplish, was smeared over their 
muzzles. 

A long narrow snout intruded be- 
tween two bars of his cage. Raw- 
lins kicked at it. The snout withdrew. 
To his left, another jutted through. 
Then there were three snouts. 

And then the scavengers began 
slipping into the cage on all sides. 


B oardman had established a com- 
fortable little nest for himself 
in the Zone F camp. Under the 
mUky-white curve of the extrusion 
dome he had carved a private sec- 
tor with radiant heating, glow-drapes, 
a gravity suppressor, and even a 
liquor console. Brandy and other de- 
lights were never far away. He slept 
on a soft inflatable mattress covered 
with a thick red quilt inlaid with 
heater strands. 

Greenfield entered. “We’ve lost an- 
other drone, sir,” he said crisply. 
“That leaves three in the inner 
zones.” 

( 

Boardman flipped the ignition cap 
on a cigar. “Is Muller going to get 
those too?” 

“I’m afraid so. He knows the ac- 
cess routes better than we do. He’s 
covering them all.” 

“And you haven’t sent any drones 
in through routes we haven’t chart- 
ed?” 

‘Two, sir. Lost them both.” 
“Umm. We’d better send out a 
great many probes' at once, then, 
and hope we can slip at least one of 
them past Muller. That boy is getting 
annoyed at being caged. Change the 
program, will you? The brain can 
manage diversionary tactics if it’s 
told. Say, twenty probes entering 
simultaneously.” 

“We have only three left,” Green- 
field said. 

“Who allowed this to happen? Call 
Hosteen! Get those templates work- 
ing! I want fifty drones built by 
morning! No, make it eighty! Of all 
the stupi^ty, Greenfield!” 


THE Ai\AN IN THE MAZE 


127 



Boardman puffed furiously. He 
dialed for brandy, the thick, rich, 
viscous stuff made by Prolepticalist 
fathers on DeUeb XIII. The situation 
was growing infuriating. He knew 
that he was in danger of losing his 
perspective — the worst of sins. The 
delicacy of this assignment was get- 
ting to him. All these mincing steps, 
the tiny complications, the painstak- 
ing edgings tdward and away from 
the goal. Rawlins in the cage. Raw- 
lins and his moral qualms. Muller and 
his neurotic world-outlook. The little 
beasts that nipped at your heels here 
and thoughtfully eyed your throat. 
The traps these demons had built. 
And the waiting extragalactics, sau- 
cer-eyed, radio-sensed, to whom even 
a Charles Boardman was no more 
than an insensate vegetable. Doom 
overhanging all. 

With a petulant gesture of his hand 
Boardman reactivated his communi- 
cation link with Ned Rawlins. The 
screen showed him moonlight, curv- 
ing bars and small furry snouts 
bristling with teeth. 

“Ned?” he said. “Charles here. 
We’re getting you those drones, boy. 
We’ll have you out of that stupid 
cage in five minutes, do you hear, 
five minutes.” 

awlins was very busy. 

It seemed almost funny. There 
was no end to the supply of the little 
beasts. They came nosing through 
the bars two and three at a time, 
weasels, ferrets, minks, stoats, what- 
ever they were, all teeth and eyes. 
But they were scavengers, not killers. 
They clustered about him, brushing 
his ankles with their coarse fur, paw- 


ing him, slicing through his skin with 
their claws, biting his shins. 

He trampled them. He learned 
very quickly that a booted foot placed 
just behind the head could snap a 
spinal column quickly and effectively. 
Then, with a swift kick, he could 
sweep his victim into a corner of the 
cage, where others would pounce up- 
on it at once. Cannibals, too. Rawlins 
developed a rhythm of it. Turn, 
stomp, kick. Turn, stomp, kick. 
Crunch. Crunch. Crunch. 

They were cutting him up badly. 

For the first five minutes he 
scarcely had time to pause for breath. 
He took care of at least twenty of 
them in that time. Against the far 
side of the cage a heap of ragged lit- 
tle corpses had risen, with their com- 
rades nosing around hunting for the 
tender morsels. At last a moment 
came when all the scavengers cm:- 
rently inside the cage were busy with 
their fallen cohorts, and no more 
lurked outside. Rawlins had a mo- 
mentary respite. He seized a bar with 
one hand and lifted his left leg to 
examine the miscellany of cuts, 
scratches and bites. Do they ^ve a 
posthumous Stellar Cross if you die 
of galactic rabies, he wondered? His 
leg was bloody from the knee down, 
and the wounds, though not deep, 
were hot and painful. Suddenly he 
discovered why the scavengers had 
come to him. While he paused he had 
time to inhale, and he smelled the 
ripe fragrance of rotting meat. He 
could almost visualize it: a great be- 
stial corpse, split open at the belly 
to. expose red sticky organs, perhaps 
a maggot or two circumnavigating the 
mound of flesh — 



128 


IF 



Nothing was rotting here. Rawlins 
realized that it must be some sensory 
delusion: an olfactory trap touched 
off by the cage, evidently. The cage 
was broadcasting the stink of decay. 
Why? Obviously to lure that pack of 
little weasels inside. A refined form 
of torture. He wondered if Muller 
had somehow seen behind it, going 
off to a nearby control center to set 
up the scent. 

A fresh battalion of beasts was 
scurrying across the plaza toward the 
cage. These looked slightly larger, al- 
though not so large that they would 
not fit between the bars, and their 
fangs had ‘an ugly gleam in the moon- 
light. Rawlins hastily stomped three 
of the snuffling, gorging . cannibals 
still alive in his cage and stuffed 
them through the bars, giving them 
a wrist-flip that tossed them ei^t or 
ten meters outside the cage. Good. 
The newcomers halted skiddingly and 
began at once to pounce on the 
twitching, not quite dead bodies that 
landed before &em. Only a few of 
the scavengers bothered to enter the 
cage, and these came spaced widely 
enough so that Rawlins had a chance 
to trample each in turn and toss it 
meters. The last few survivors, stuff- 
out to feed the onrushing horde. At 
that rate, he thought, he could get rid 
of them all, if only new ones would 
stop coming. 

New ones finally did stop coming. 
He had killed seventy or eighty by this 
time; the stink of raw blood overlaid 
the synthetic stench of rot; his legs 
ached from all the carnage and his 
brain was orbiting dizzyingly. But at 
length the night grew peaceful once 
more. Bodies, some clad in fur, some 


just frameworks of bone, lay strewn 
in a wide arc before the cage. A 
thick deep-hued puddle of mingled 
bloods spread over a dozen square 
meters. The last few survivors, stuff- 
ed on their gluttony, had gone slink- 
ing away without even trying to ha- 
rass the occupant of the cage. Weary, 
drained, close to laughter and close 
to tears, Rawlins clung to the bars 
and did not look down at his throb- 
bing, blood-soaked legs. He felt the 
fire rising in him. He imagined alien 
microorganisms launching their ar- 
gosies in his bloodstream. 

T hree bulky brutes paraded to- 
ward him from different direc- 
tions. They had the stride of lions, 
but the swinishness of boars: low- 
slung, sharp-backed creatures, 100 
kilograms or so, with long pyrami- 
dal heads, slavering thin-lipped 
mouths, and tiny squinting eyes ar- 
ranged, two sets of two on either 
side, just before their ragged droopy 
ears. Curving tusks jutted down and 
intersected smaller and sharper ca- 
nine teeth that rose from powerful 
jaws. They rooted about a bit in the 
heap of scavenger corpses. But clearly 
they were no scavengers themselves; 
they were looking for living meat, 
and their disdain for the broken can- 
nibalized little bodies was evident. 
When they had completed their in- 
spection, they swung about to stare 
at Rawlins. Rawlins felt grateful for 
the security of his cage. He would 
not care to be outside, unprotected 
and exhausted, with these three cruis- 
ing the city for their dinner. 

At that moment, of course, the 
bars of the cage began to retract. 


THE MAN IN THE MAZE 


129 



xn 

M uller, arriving just then, took in 
the whole scene. “Get down!” 
he yelled. ^ 

Rawlins got down by taking four 
running steps to the left, slipping on 
the blood-slicked pavement, and 
skidding into a heap of small ca- 
davers at the edge of the street. In 
the same moment Muller fired. Three 
quick bolts brought the pigs down. 
Muller started to go to Rawlins, but 
then one of the robots from the 
camp in Zone F appeared, gliding 
cheerfulUy toward them. Muller 
cursed softly. He pulled the destruc- 
tor globe from his pocket and aimed 
the window at the robot. 

The robot disintegrated. Rawlins 
had managed to get up. “You should 
not have blasted it,” he said woozily. 
“It was just coming to help.” 

“No help was needed,” said Mul- 
ler. “Can you walk?” 

“I think so.” 

“How badly are you hurt?” 

“I’ve been chewed on, that’s all. 
It isn’t as bad as it looks.” 

“Come with me,” Muller said. Al- 
ready more scavengers were filing 
through the plaza, drawn by the mys- 
terious telegraphy of blood. Small 
toothy things were getting down to 
serious work on the trio of fallen 
boars. Forgetting his own emanation, 
Muller seized him by the arm. Raw- 
lins winced and twitched away, and 
then, as if repenting the appearance 
of rudeness, gave Muller his arm 
again. They crossed the plaza to- 
gether. 

“In here,” Muller said roughly. 
They stepped into the hexagonal 


cell where he kept his diagnostat. 
Muller sealed the door, and Raw- 
lins sank down limply on the bare 
floor. 

Muller said, “How long were you 
under attack?” 

“Fifteen, twenty minutes. I don’t 
know. There must have been fifty or 
a hundred of them. I kept breaking 
their backs. And then the cage went 
away.” Rawlins laughed wildly. “That 
was the best part. I had just finished 
smashing up all those little bastards, 
and I was catching my breath, and 
then the three big monsters came 
along, and so naturally the cage van- 
ished and — ” 

“Easy,” Muller said. “You’re talk- 
ing so fast I can’t follow everything. 
Get those boots off, and we’ll patch 
those legs of yours.” 

Rawlins picked at the catches. 
“Can you help me? I’m afraid that 
I can’t — ” 

“You won’t like it if I come any 
closer,” Muller warned. 

“To hell with that!” 

Muller shrugged. He approached 
Rawlins and manipulated the broken 
and bent snaps of his boots. The met- 
al chasing was scarred by tiny teeth; 
so were the boots themselves, and so 
were the legs. In a few moments Raw- 
lins was out of his boots and leg- 
gings. His legs were in bad shape, 
though none of the wounds seemed 
really serious; it was just that there 
were so many of them. MuUer got 
the diagnostat going. The lamps 
glowed, and the receptor slot beck- 
oned. A blue light played on his 
wounds. In the bowels of the diag- 
nostat things chuttered and clicked. 
A swab came forth on a jointed arm 

IF 


130 



and raa deftly and lightly up his left 
leg to a point just above the knee. 
The machine engulfed the bloody 
swab and began to digest it back to 
its component molecules while a sec- 
ond swab emerged to clean up his 
other leg. Rawlins bit his lip. He was 
getting a coagulant as well as a 
cleanser, so that when the swabs had 
done their work all blood was gone 
and the shallow gouges and rips were 
revealed. It still looked pretty bad, 
Muller thought, though not as grim 
as before. 

T he diagnostat produced an ultra- 
sonic node and injected a golden 
fluid into Rawlin’s rump. Pain-damp- 
er. A second injection, deep amber, 
was probably some kind of all-pur- 
pose antibiotic to ward off infection. 
Rawlins grew visibly less tense. Now 
arms sprang forward from various 
sectors of the device, inspecting Raw- 
lins’s lesions in detail scanning them 
for necessary repairs. There was a 
humming sound and three sharp 
clicks. Then the diagnostat began to 
seal the wounds, clamping them firm- 
ly- 

“You shouldn’t be doing this,” said 
Rawlins. “We have our own medical 
supplies back in camp. You must be 
nming short on necessities. All you 
had to do was let the drone probe 
take me back to my camp, and — ” 
“I don’t want those robots crawl- 
ing around in here. And the diag- 
nostat has at least a fifty-year supply 
of usefuls. I don’t get sick often.” 
The machine released Rawlins, 
who swimg away from it and looked 
up at Muller. The wildness was gone 
from the boy’s face now. Muller said. 


“I didn’t think that you’d be attacked 
by beasts or I wouldn’t have left you 
alone so long. You aren’t armed?” 
“No.” 

“Scavengers don’t bother living 
things. What made them go after 
you?” 

“The cage did,” Rawlins said. “It 
began to broadcast the smell of rot- 
ting flesh. A lure. Suddenly they were 
crawling all over me. I thought they’d 
eat me alive.” 

Muller grinned. “Interesting. So 
the cage is programmed as a trap too. 
We got some useful information out 
of your little predicament, then.” 
Rawlins laughed. “I’m glad to have 
helped you learn something. Am I ex- 
cused from the next round?” 

4CT suppose,” Muller said. An odd 
Ji feeling of good will had come 
over him, somehow. He almost for- 
gotten how pleasant it was to be able 
to help anodier person. He said, “Do 
you drink, Ned?” 

“In moderation.” 

“This is our local liquer,” said 
Muller. “It’s produced by gnomes 
somewhere in the bowels of the plan- 
et.” He produced a delicate flask and 
two wide-mouthed goblets. Carefully 
he tipped about twenty centiliters 
into each goblet. “I get this in 2k>ne 
C,” he explained, handing Rawlins 
his drink. 

Gingerly Rawlins tasted it. 
“Strongl” 

“About 60% alcohol, yes. Lord 
knows what the rest of it is, or how 
it’s synthesized, or why. I simply ac- 
cept it. I like the way it manages to 
be both sweet and ^gery at the same 
time. It’s terribly intoxicating, of

course. It’s intended as another trap, 
i suppose. You get happily drunk, 
and then the maze gets you.” He 
raised his goblet amiably. “Cheers.” 

“Cheers.” 

They laughed at the archaic toast 
and dnmk. 

Careful, Dickie, he told himself. 
You’re getting downright sociable, 
with this boy. Remember where you 
are. And why. 

“May 1 take some of this back to 
camp with me?” Rawlins asked. 
•Tliere’s a man there who’d appreci- 
ate it. He’s a gourmet of sorts. He’s 
traveling with a liquor console that 
dispenses a hundred different drinks, 
1 imagine, from about forty differ- 
ent worlds.” 

“Anything from Marduk?” Mul- 
ler asked. “The Deneb worlds? Ri- 
gel?” 

“I really can’t be sure. I’m no 
connoisseur.” 

“Perhaps this friend of yours 
would be willing to exchange — ” 
Muller stopped. “No. No. Forget 
I said that. I’m not getting into any 
deals.” 

“You could come back to camp 
with me,” said Rawlins. “He’d give 
you the run of the console, I’m sure.” 

“Very subtie of you. No.” Muller 
glowered at his liqueur. “I won’t be 
eased into it, Ned. I don’t want any- 
thing to do with them.” 

“I’m sorry you feel that way.” 

“Another drink?” 

“No. I’ll have to start getting back 
to camp now. It’s late.” Rawli^ fin- 
ished his drink and got to his feet, 
grunting a little. He looked down at 
his bare legs. The diagnbstat had cov- 
ered the wounds with a nutrient 


spray, flesh-colored; it was almost im- 
possible to tell that his skin had been 
broken anywhere. Stiffly he puUed his 
tattered leggings on. “You’ll give me 
some of that liqueur for my friend?” 
Silently Muller extended the flask, 
half full. 

Rawlins clipped it to his belt. “It 
was an interesting day. I hope 1 can 
come again.” 

B oardman said, as Rawlins limped 
back toward Zone E, “How are 
your legs?” 

‘Tired. They’re healing fast. I’ll be 
all right.” 

“Ned, listen to me, we did try to 
get the drones to you. I was watch- 
ing every terrible minute of it, when 
those animals were attacking you. But 
there was nothing we could do. Mul- 
ler was intercepting our probes and 
knocking them out.” 

“All right,” Rawlins said. 

“He’s clearly unstable. He wasn’t 
going to let one of those drones in- 
to the inner zones.” 

“All right, Charles. I survived.” 
Boardman said after a long while, 
“It seems you and Muller are quite 
good friends now. I’m pleased. It’s 
c^Qining to-be time for you to tempt 
him out.” 

“How do I do that?” 

“Promise him a cure,” Boardman 

said. 

XIII 

I 

T hey met again on the third day 
afterward, at midday in Zone B. 
Rawlins came diagonally across the 
oval ball court, or whatever it was, 
that lay between two snub-nosed dark 


132 


IF 



blue towers» and Muller nodded. 
“How are your legs?” 

“Doing fine.” 

“And your friend? He liked the 
liqueur?” 

“He loved it,” Rawlins said, think- 
ing of the glow in Boardman’s foxy 
eyes. “He sends back your flask with 
some special brandy in it and hopes 
you’ll treat him to a second round.” 

Muller eyed the flask as Rawlins 
held it forA. “He can go to hell,” 
Muller said coolly. “I won’t get into 
any trades. If you give me that flask 
I’ll smash it.” 

“Why?” 

“Give it here, and I’ll show you. 
No. Wait. Wait. I won’t. Here, let 
me have it.” 

Rawlins surrendered it. Muller 
cradled the lovely flask tenderly in 
both hands, activated the cap, and 
put it to his lips. “You devils,” he 
said in a soft voice. “What is this, 
from the monastery on Deneb XIII?” 

“He didn’t say. He just said you’d 
like it.” 

“Devils. Temptations. It’s a trade, 
damn you! But only this once. Where 
have you been all week, anyway?” 

“Working.” 

“Where are they excavating?” 

“They aren’t excavating at aU. 
They’re using sonic -probes at the 
border between Zone E and F. Try- 
ing to determine the chronology, 
whether the whole maze was built 
at once, or in accretive layers out 
from the middle. What’s your 
opinion, Dick?” 

“Go to hell. No free archeology 
out of me!” Muller sipped the bran- 
dy again. ‘*You’re standing pretty 
close to me, aren’t you?” 


“Four or five meters, I’d guess.” 
“You were closer when you gave 
me the brandy. Why didn’t you look 
sick? Didn’t you feel the effect?” 

“I felt i^ yes.” 

“And hid your feelings like the 
good stoic you are?” 

Shrugging, Rawlins said genially, 
“1 guess the effect loses impact on 
repeated exposure. Have you ever no- 
ticed that happening with someone 
else?” 

“There were no repeated exposures 
with anyone else,” said Muller. 
“Come over here, boy. See the sights. 
This is my water supply. Quite ele- 
gant. This black pipe runs right 
around Zone B.” Muller knelt and 
stroked the aqueduct. “There’s a 
pumping system. Brings water up 
from some underground aquifer^ 
maybe a thousand kilometers down. 
Over here, you see, here’s one of the 
spigots. Every fifty meters. As far 
as 1 can tdl, it’s the water supply for 
the entire city, right here, and so 
perhaps the builders didn’t need 
much water. No conduits that I’ve 
found. No real plumbing.” 

Muller cupped his hand under the 
ornately engraved spigot, a thing of 
concentric ridges. Water gushed. Mul- 
ler took a few quick gulps; the flow 
ceased the moment the hand was 
t^en from the area below the spigot. 
A scanning system of some kind, 
Rawlins thou^t. Clever. How had it 
lasted all these millions of years? 

T hey went into Zone A, an easy 
stroll. Muller was in a talkative 
mood. The conversation was fitful, 
dissolving every now and then into 
an acid spray of anger or self-pity. 


THE AAAN IN THE AAAZE 


133 



but most of the time Muller remain- 
ed calm and even charming, an older 
man clearly enjoying the company of 
a younger one, the two of them ex- 
changing opinions, experiences, scraps 
of philosophy. Muller spoke a good 
deal about his early career, the 
planets he bad seen, the delicate ne- 
gotatk>ns on behalf of Earth with 
the frequently prickly colony worlds. 
He mentioned Boardman’s name 
quite often; Rawlins kept his face 
studiously blank. 

“And what about you?” Muller 
said finally. “You’re brighter than 
you pretend to be. Hampered a little 
by your shyness, but plenty of brains, 
carefully hidden behind college-boy 
virtues. What do you want for your- 
self, Ned? What does archeology give 
you?” 

Rawlins looked him straight in the 
eyes. “A chance to recapture a mil- 
lion pasts. I’m as greedy as you are. 
I want to know how things happened, 
how they got this way. Not just on 
Earth or in the System. Everywhere.” 

“Well spokenP’ 

Rawlins said, “1 suppose I could 
have gone in for diplomatic service, 
the way you did. Instead I chose 
this. 1 think it’ll work out. There’s 
so much to discover, here and every- 
where else. We’ve only begun to 
look.” 

‘The ring of dedication is in your 
voice. 1 like to hear that sound. It 
reminds me of the way 1 used to 
talk.” 

Rawlins said, “Just so you don’t 
think I’m hopdessly pure, 1 ought 
to say that it’s personal curiosity that 
moves me on, more than abstract 
love of knowledge.” 


' “Understandable. Forgiveable. We 
are not too different, really. Allowing 
for forty-odd years between us. Don’t 
worry so much about your motives, 
Ned. Go to the stars, see, do. Enjoy. 
Eventually life will sma^ you, the 
way it’s smashed me, but that’s far 
off.” 

Rawlins felt the warmth of the 
man now, the reaching out of genuine 
sympathies. There was still th^ car- 
rier wave of nightmare, though, the 
unending broadcast out of the mucky 
depths of the soul, attenuated at this 
distance but unmistakeable. Impris- 
oned by his pity, Rawlins hesitated 
to say what it now was time to say. 
Boardman prodded him irritably. 
“Go on, boyl Slip it ini” 

“You look very far away,” Muller 
said. 

“Just thinking how — how sad it 
is that you won’t trust us at all. That 
you have such a negative attitude to- 
ward humanity/’ 

“I come by it honestly.” 

“You don’t need to spend the rest 
of your life in this maze, though. 
There’s a way out.” 

“Garbage.” 

“Listen to me,” Rawlins said. He 
took a deep breath and flashed his 
quick, transparent grin. “1 talked 
about your case to our expedition 
medic. He’s studied neurosurgery. He 
says there’s a way to fix what you 
have, now. Recently developed, the 
last couple of years. It — shuts off 
the broadcast, Dick. We’ll take you 
back to Earth. For the operation, 
Dick. The cure.” 


T 


he sharp glittering barbed word 
came swimming along on the 


134 


IF 



breast of a torrent of bland sounds 
and speared him in the gut. Cure. 
He stared. There was reverberation 
from the looming dark buildings. 
Cure. Cure. Cure. Muller felt the 
poisonous temptation gnawing at his 
liver. “No,” he said. “That’s gar- 
bage. A cure’s impossible.” 

“How can you be so sure?” 

“I know.” 

“Science progresses in nine years. 
They understand how the brain 
works, now. Its electrical nature. 
What they did, they built a tremen- 
dous simulation intone of the lunar 
labs, and they ran it all through 
from start to finish.” 

“You look so angelic,” . Muller 
said. “Those sweet blue eyes and 
that golden hair. What’s your game, 
Ned? Why are you reeling off all 
this nonsense.” 

Rawlins reddened. “It isn’t non- 
sensel” 

“I don’t believe you. And I don’t 
believe in your cure.” 

There was a long sticky silence. 
Muller revolved a maze of 
thoughts. To leave Lemnos? To have 
the curse lifted? To hold a woman in 
his arms again? Breasts like fire 
against his skin? Lips? Thigbs? To 
rebuild his career? To reach across 
the heavens once more? To shuck 
nine years of anguish? To believe? 
To go? To submit? 

“7j there a cure?” 

“The medic says there is.” 

“I think you’re lying to me, boy;” 
Rawlins danced away. “What do 
I have to gain by lying?” 

‘T can’t guess.” 

“All right, I’m lying,” Rawlins 
said brusquely. “There’s no way to 


help you. Let’s talk about something 
else.” 

“Why did you tell me that story 
if it wasn’t true?” 

“I said we’d change the subject.” 

‘^Let’s assume for the moment that 
it is true,” Muller persisted. “That if 
I go back to Earth I can be cured. I 
want to let you know that I’m just 
not interested not even with a guar- 
antee. I’ve seen Earthmen in their 
true natures. They kicked me when I 
was down. Not sporting, Ned. They 
stink. They reel^ They gloried in 
what had happened to me.” 

“That isn’t sol” 

“What do you know? You were a 
child. Even more then than now. 
They treated me as filth because I 
showed them what was inside them- 
selves. A mirror for their dirty souls. 
Why should I go back to them now? 
I saw them as they really are, those 
few months I was on Earth after 
Beta Hydri IV. The look in the eyes, 
the nervous smile as they back away 
from me. Yes, Mr. Muller. ,Of 
course, Mr. Muller. Just don’t come 
too close, Mr. Muller. Boy, come 
by here some time at night and let 
me show you the constellations as 
seen from Lenmos. I’ve ^ven them 
my own names. There’s the Dagger, 
a long keen one. It’s about to be 
thrust into the Back. Then there’s 
the Sh^. And you can see the Ape^ 
too, and the Toad. They interlock. 
The same star is in the forehead of 
the Ape and the left eye of the Toad. 
That star is Sol, my Mend. An ugly 
little yellow star, ^e color of thin 
vomit Whose plwets are populated 
by ugly little people who have spread 
throng the universe.”

44/^aa 1 say something that might 
offend you?” Rawlins asked. 
“You can’t offend me. But you can 
try.” 

“f think your outlook is distorted. 
You’ve lost your perspectm> all 
those years. You’re blaming humanity 
for being humanu It’s not easy to 
accept someone like you. If you were 
sitting here in my place» and 1 in 
yours, you’d understand tliat. It hurts 
to be near you. It hurts. Right now 1 
feel pain in every nerve. If 1 came 
closer I’d tod like crying. You can’t 
expect people to adjust quickly to 
somebody like that. Not even your 
loved ones could — ” 

“1 had no loved ones.” 

“You were married.” 
“Tenmnated.” 

“Friends?” 

**Thoy ran,” Muller said. “On all 
six legs they scuttled away from me.” 
“You didn’t give them time.” 
‘Time enough.” 

“No,” Rawlins said. He shifted 
about uneasily on the chair. “Now 
Fm going to say something that will 
really hurt you, Dick. I’m sorry, but 
I have to. What you’re telling me is 
the kind of stuff I beard in college. 
Sophomore cynicism. The wodd is 
de^cable, you say. Evil evil evil. 
You’ve seen the true nature of man^ 
kind and you don’t want anything to 
do mth mankind ever again. Ei^ry- 
body talks that way at eighteen. But 
k’s a phase tiiat passes. We get over 
the confurioos of being eighten, and 
we see that the world is a pretty de- 
cent place, that people tiy to do 
theif best, that we’re imper^t but 
not loathsome — ” 

“An eighteen-year-old has no right 


to those opinions. I do. I come by my 
hatreds the hard way.” 

“But why cling to them? You seem 
to be glorying in your own misery. 
Break loose] Shake it off I Come back 
to Earth with us and forget the past. 
Or at least forgive.” 

“No forgetting. No forgiving.” 
Muller scowled. A tremor of feat 
shook him, and he shivered. What if 
this were true? A genuine cure? Leave 
Lemnos? He felt a trifle embarrassed. 
The boy had semed a palpable hit 
with that line about sophomore cyn- 
ictsm. It was. Am 1 really such a 
misanthrope? A pose. He ^rced me 
to adopt it. Now 1 choke on my own 
stubbomness. But there’s 210 cure. 
The boy’s transparent; he’s lying, 
though 1 don’t k^w why, wants to 
trap me, to get me aboaM that ship 
of theirs. What if it’s true? Why not 
go back? Muller could supply his 
own answers. It was the fe^ that 
held him. To see Earth’s billions. To 
enter the stream of life. Nine years on 
a desert island and he dread^ to re- 
turn. 

Rawlins said, “1 can feel the flavor 
of your thoughts changing.” , 

“You can?'* 

“Nothing specific. But you were 
angry and bitter before. Now I’m 
getting something — wistful.” 

“No one ever told me he could de- 
tect meanings,” Muller said in won- 
der. 

“Why did you go wistful just then, 
though? If you did. Thinking of 
Earth?” 

“Maybe I was.” Muller hastily 
patched the sudden gap in his annor. 
His face darkened. He denebed his 
jaws. He stood up and deliberately

t36 



approached Rawlins^ watching the 
young man struggling to hide his real 
fedin^ of discomfort. Muller said, 
“I think you’d better get about your 
archeologizing now, Ned.” 

*1 still have some time.” 

“No you don’t. Go.” 

XVI 

A gainst Charles Boardman’s ex- 
press orders, Rawlins insisted 
on returning all the way to the Zone 
F camp that evening. He found 
Boardman at dinner. A polished din- 
ing-board of dark wood mortised with 
light woods set before him. Out of 
elegant stoneware he ate candied 
fruits, brandied vegetables, meat ex- 
tracts, pungent juices. A carafe of 
wine of a deep oUve hue was near his 
fleshy hand. Mysterious pills of sev- 
eral types rested in the shallow pits 
of an oblong block of black glass; 
from time to time Boardman popped 
one into his mouth. Rawlins stood 
at the sector opening for a long while 
before Boardman appeared to notice 
him. 

“I told you not to come here, 
Ned,” the old man said finally. 

“Muller sends you this.” Rawlins 
put the flask down beside the carafe 
of wine. 

“We could have talked without 
this visit.” 

‘Tm tired of that. I needed to see 
you.” Boardman left him standing 
and did not interrupt his meal. 
“Charles, I don’t think I can keep up 
the pretense with him.” 

“You did an excellent job today,” 
said Boardman, sipping his wine. 
“Quite convincing.” 


“Yes, I’m learning how to tell lies. 
But what’s the use? You heard him. 
Mankind disgusts him. He’s not going 
to cooperate once we get him out of 
the maze.” 

“He isn’t sincei:c. You said it your- 
self, Ned. Cheap sophomore cyni- 
cism. The man loves mankind. That’s 
why he’s so bitter: because his love 
has turned sour in his mouth. But it 
hasn’t turned to hate.” 

Rawlins bent into a crouch to get 
on Boardman’s level. Boardman 
nudged a candied pear onto his fork, 
equalized gravity, and flipped it idly 
toward his mouth. He’s intentionally 
ignoring me, Rawlins thought. He 
said, “Charles be serious. I’ve gone in 
there and told Muller some monstrous 
lies. I’ve offered him a completely 
fraudulent cure, and he threw it back 
in my face.” 

“Saying he didn’t believe it existed. 
But he does believe, Ned. He’s sim- 
ply afraid to come out of hiding.” 
“Please. Listen. Assume he does 
come to believe me. Assume he 
leaves the maze and puts himself in 
our hands. Then what? Who gets the 
job of telling him that there isn’t 
any cure, that weVe tricked him 
shamelessly, that we merely want 
him to be our ambassador again, to 
visit a bunch of aliens twenty times 
as strange and fifty times as deadly 
as the ones that ruined his life? Vm 
not going to break that news to him!” 
“You won’t have to, Ned. I will.” 
“And how will he react? Are you 
simply expecting him to smile and 
bow and say, very clever, Charles, 
you’ve done it again? To yield and 
do whatever you want? No. He 
couldn’t possibly.” 


THE MAN IN THE MAZE 


137 



“That isn’t necessarily true,” said 
Boardman calmly, 

^^WIU you e^q^iain the tactics you 
pr<^)ose to use» theiv once you’ve in- 
formed him that the cure is a lie 
and that there’s a dangerous new job 
he has to undertake?” 

“1 prefer not to discuss future 
strategy now.” 

“I resign,” Rawlins sakL 

B oardman had been expecting 
something like that. A noUe 
gesture; a moment of headstrong de- 
fiance; a rush of virtue to the l^ain. 
Abandoning now his studied detach- 
ment, he looked up, his eyes locking 
firmly on Rawlins’s. 

Quietly Boardman said, “You re- 
sign? After all your talk of service 
to mankind? We need you, Ned.” 
“My dedication to mankind in- 
cludes a dedication to Dick Muller,” 
Rawlins said stiffly. “I’ve already 
committed a considerable crime 
against him. If you won’t let me in 
on the rest of this scheme, I’m 
damned if I’ll have any part in it.” 
adnure your convictions.” 

“My resignation sdll stands.” 

“I even agree with your position,” 
said Boardman. “I’m not proud of 
what we must do here.” 

“How are you gmng to get Muller 
to cooperate? Drug him? Torture 
him? Brainblast him?” 

“None of those.” 

“What, then? I’m serious, Charles. 
My role in this job ends right here, ^ 
unless 1 know w^t’s ahead.” 
Bosudman coughed, drained his 
wine, ate a peach, took three pSls • 
in quick successicm. Rawlinses rebd- 
lion had been inevitable, and he was 


prepared for it, and yet he was an- 
noyed that it had come. Now was the 
time for calculated risks. He said, 
‘1 see that it’s time to drop the 
pretenses, then, Ned. I’ll tell you 
what’s in store f < m: Dick Muller — 
but I want you to consider it within 
the framework of the larger position. 
Don’t forget that the little game we’ve 
been playing on this planet isn’t sim- 
ply a matter of private moral pos- 
tures.” 

“I’m listening, Charles.” 

“Very well. Dick Muller must go 
to our extragalactic friends and con- 
vince them that human beings ^e in- 
deed an intelligent species. Agreed? 
He alone is capable of doing this, be- 
cause of his unique inability to cloak 
his thoughts.” 

“Agreed.” 

“Now, it isn’t necessary to convince 
the alii^ that we’re good people, or 
that we’re honorable people, or. that 
we’re lovable people. Sim^y that we 
have minds and can think. That we 
feel, that we sense, that we are some- 
thing other than clever machines. For 
our purposes it doesn’t matter what 
emotions Dick Muller is radiating, so 
long as he’s radiating something.” 

“I begin to see.” 

“Therefore, once he’s out of the 
maze, we can tell him what his as- 
signment is to be. No doubt he’ll get 
angry at our trickery. But beyond 
his anger he may see where his duty 
lies. I hope so. You seem to think he 
won’t. But it makes no difference, 
Ned. He won’t be giv^ an option 
once he leaves his sanctuary. He’ll be 
tak^ to the aliens and handed over 
to them to make contact.” 

“His cooperation is irrelevant.

Rawlii^’s face was pate a mom^t 
Then color flooded into it He dan^ 
ed his lips. Boardman smiled bmgn- 
ly. Rawlins clenched his fists, squuU- 
turned, went hastily out. 

A calculated risk. 

Boardman lock another pill. Then 
he reached for ttxe flask Muller had 
sent him. He poured a littte. Sweet, 
gihgery, strong. An excellent liqueur.

M uller had almost come to like 
the Hydrans. What he remem- 
bered most clearly and most favorably 
about them was their grace of mo- 
tion. 

He had landed in a damp, dreary 
part of the i^anet, a little to the 
north of its equator, on an amoe- 
boid continent occupied by a dozen 
large quasi-cities, each spread ovA 
over several thous^md square kilom- 
eters. His life-support system, spe- 
cially designed for this mission, was 
littte more than a thin f iltzation sheet 
dinging to him like a second titin. It 
fed air to him through a thousand 


dialysis plaques. He oioved easily if 
not comfortably within it 

He walked for an hour through a 
forest of the giant toadstool-like trees 
before he came upon any of the na- 
tives. The trees ran to heights of sev- 
eral hundred meters; perhaps the 
gravity, five-eighth Earthnorm, had 
something to do with that Their 
curving trunks did not look sturdy. 
He suspected that an external woody 
layer no thicker than a fing^p 
surrounded a broad core of soggy 
pulp. The cap-like crowns of the 
trees met in a neatiy continuous can- 
opy overhead, cutting almost all light 
from the forest floor. Since the pl^- 
et*s doud layer permitted only a hazy 
pearl-cdored to come through> 
and even that was intercepted by the 
trees, a maroon darkness prevafled 
below. 

When he encountered the aliens 
he was surprised to find that they 
were about three meters talk He 
stood ringed by them, straining up- 
ward to meet their many eyes. In a 
quiet voice he said, “My name is 
Richard Muller. 1 come in friendship 
from the peo^es of the Terran Cul- 
tural Sphere.” 

Dropping to his knees, Muller 
traced the Pytiiagorean Theorem in 
the soft mcH&t soil 

He looked up. He smiled. “A batic 
concept of geometry. A universal 
pattern of thought.” 

Their vertical slitlike nostrils 
fiid^ered dightiy. They inclined their 
heads. He imagined that they were 
exchan^g thoug^itful glsmces. With 
eyes in a circlet entirely around their 
heads, they did not need to diange 
posture to do that. 


THE MAN IN THE MAZE

He sketched a line on the ground. 
A short distance from it he sketched 
a pair of lines. At a greater distance 
he drew three lines. He filled in the 
signs^ h plus 11 equals 111. 

“Yes?” he said. “We call it addi- 
tion.” 

The jointed limbs swayed. Two of 
his listeners touched arms. Muller re- 
membered how they had obliterated 
the spying eye as soon as they had 
discovered it, not hesitating even to 
examine it. He had been prepared 
for the same reaction. Instead they 
were listening. A promising sign. He 
stood up and pointed to his marks on 
the ground. 

I “Your turn,” he said. He spoke 
V quite loudly. He smiled quite broad- 
^ ly. “Show me that you understand. 
Speak to me in the universal lan- 
guage of mathematics.” 

After a long pause one of the Hy- 
drans moved fluidly forward and let 
one of its globe-like foot-pedestals 
hover over the lines in the soil. The 
leg moved lightly, and the lines van- 
ished as the alien smoothed the soil. 

“All right,” said Muller. “Now you 
draw something.” 

The Hydran returned to its place 
in the circle. 

“Very well,” Muller said. “There’s 
another universal language. I hope 
this doesn’t offend your ears.” He 
drew a soprano recorder from his 
pocket and put it between his lips. 
Playing through the filtration sheet 
was cumbersome. He caught breath 
and played a diatonic scale. Their 
limbs fluttered a bit. They could hear, 
then, or at any rate could sense vi- 
brations. 

“Does that get to you?” he asked. 


They appeared to be conferring. 

They walked away from him. 

He tried to follow. He was unable 
to keep up, and soon he lost sight 
of them in the dark, misty forest; but 
he persevered and found them clus- 
tered as if waiting for him, farther 
on. When he neared them they began 
to move again. In this way they led 
him, by fits and starts, into their city. 

He subsisted on synthetics. Chemical 
analysis showed that it would be un- 
wise to try local foods. 

He drew the Pythagorean Theo- 
rem many times. He sketched a va- 
riety of arithmetical processes. He 
played Schonberg and Bach. He con- 
structed equilateral triangles. He ven- 
tured into solid geometry. He sang. 
He spoke French, Russian and Man- 
darin, as well as English, to show 
them the diversity of human tongues. 
He displayed a chart of the periodic 
table. After six months he still knew 
nothing more about the workings of 
their minds than he had an hour be- 
fore landing. They tolerated his pres- 
ence, but they said nothing to him. 

Eventually they wearied of him 
and came for him. 

He slept. 

He did not discover until much 
later what had been done to him 
while he slept. 

H e had had nine years to sharpen 
his memories. He had filled a 
few cubes with reminiscences, but 
that had mainly been in the early 
years of his exile, when he worried 
about having his past drift away to 
be lost in fog. He discovered that 
the memories grew keener with age. 
Perhaps it was training. He could

He coukl reconstruct whole conver- 
sations convincingly. He was able to 
quote the liull texts of aeweral treaties 
he had negotiated. 

He admitted to bijiiself lliat, given 
(he chance, he would go hack. Every- 
Ihiflg else had been foetense and 
hhmer. He had fooied iidther Ned 
&aiii4iiis nor himself, he loiew. The 
contempt he fdt soanldnd was 
real, but not the wish to remain iso- 
lated. He waited eageijy ior Rawlins 
to letum. While he waited, he drank 
several goUets of the dtgr’s liqueur; 
he went on a killing spoee, nervously 
gunning down ammate he could not 
pesfl^y eoasunae in a year’s time; he 
oaadiipted intricate dialogues with 
himself; he dreamed of Earth. 

R awlins was ruttuihig. Muller, 
standing a hundind mefers deep 
in Zone C, saw hkn oome striding 
through the entcaoee, breathless, 
flushed. 

“Ycni shouldn’t rm in here,” Mul- 
ler said. ‘‘Even in the safer zones. 
There’s ahsohitely no leBing — ” 
Rawhns sprawled dom beside a 
rianged ttoi^one tub, griping its 
aides and sucking air. **Gtt me a 
drink, will you?” he gasped. ‘That 
hqueur of yours — »» 

Mniicr went to the fountain near- 
by and filled a handy flask with the 
sharp hqueur. Rawlins did not wince 
at ail as Muller dnew near to give it 
to him. He seemed altogether un- 
aware of Muller’s emanation. Greed- 
ily, sloppily, he emptied the flask, 
letting dr^^s of the gleaming fl^ 
roll down his dun and onto W 
clothes. Then he closed his eyes. 


“Wait. Let me get my breath. I 
ran ail the way from Zooe F.” 

' You’re lud^ to he alive, then.** 
Muller studied hifli, perplei^ The 
change was striktng and unsettUng, 
and mere fatigue could not accomt 
for it all. Randias was bloodshot, 
flushed, puffy-faoed; Ms facial mns- 
ckn were tightly jgait; Ms eyes moved 
randomly, seeking iml not finding. 
Dtouok? Sick? Awgged? 

After a long OMment Muller said,

that I was acting like a damned f col.

turn to Earth ior treatment. Even if

“There’s no treatment,” said Raw- 
lins dully. 

“No Treatment.” 

“No treatment. None. It was all a

'You said so 3 «iitt»elf,” Rawlins 
necninded him. ^ou didn’t briieve

“Lying.” 

“Yes.” 

“But I changed my mind,” said 
Midler sofitly. 'T was ready to go

“There’s no hope of a cure,” Raw- 
lins said. 

He got slowly to his feet and ran 
his hand through his long golden 
hair. He arranged his disarrayed 
clothing. He picked up the flask, 
went to the liqueur fountain and 
filled it. Returning, he handed the 
flask to Muller, who drank from it. 

Muller said finally, “Do you want 
to explain some of this?” 

“We aren’t archeologists. We came 
here looking especially for you. It 
wasn’t any accident. We knew where 
you were all along. You were track- 
ed from the time you left Earth nine 
years ago.” 

took precautions.” 

“They weren’t any use. Boardman 
knew where you were going, and he 
had you tracked. He left you in peace 
because he had no use for you. But 
when a use developed, he had to 
come after you.” 

4(^harles Boardman sent you to 
^ fetch me?” Muller asked. 
“That’s why we’re here, yes. That’s 
the whole purpose of this expedition,” 
said Rawlins tonelessly. “1 was picked 
to make contact with you because 
you knew my father and might trust 
me. All the time Boardman was di- 
recting me, telling me what to say, 
coacfa^g me, even telling me what 
mistakes to make, how to blunder 
successfully. He told me to get into 
that cage, for instance. He thought 
it would help win your sympathy.” 
“Boardman is here? Here on Lem- 
nos?” 

“In Zone F. He’s got a camp 
there.” 

Muller’s face was stony. Within, 


all was turmoil. “Why did he do all 
this? What does he want with me?” 
Rawlins said, “You know that 
there’s a third intelligent race in the 
universe, beside us and the Hydrans.” 
“Yes. They had just been discov- 
ered when I left. That was why 1 
went to visit the Hydrans. I was sup- 
posed to arrange a defensive alliance 
with them, before these other people, 
these extragalactics, came in contact 
with us. It didn’t work. But — ” 
“How much do you know about 
these extragalactics?” 

“Very little,” Muller admitted. 
“Essentially, nothing but what I’ve 
just told you. The day I agreed to 
go to Beta Hydri IV was the first 
time I heard about them. Boardman 
told us. All he said was that they 
were extremely intelligent — a su- 
perior species, he said — and that 
they lived in a neighboring cluster. 
And that they had a galactic drive 
and might visit us some day.” 

“We know more about them now,” 
Rawlins said. 

“First tell me what Boardman 
wants with me.” 

“Everything in order and it’ll be 
easier.” Rawlins grinned, perhaps a 
bit tipsily. He said, “We don’t actu- 
ally know a great deal about the 
extragalactics. What we did was send 
a ramjet out, throw it into warp, 
and bring it out a few thousand 
light-years away. Or a few million 
light-years. Anyway, it was a drone 
ship with all sorts of eyes. The place 
it went to was one of the X-ray 
galaxies, classified information, but 
I’ve heard it was either in Cygnus A 
or Scorpius II. We found that one 
planet of the galactic system was in- 

IF 


142 



habited by an advanced race of very 
alien aliens.” 

“How alien?” 

‘They see all up and down the 
spectrum,” Rawlins said. “Their ba- 
sic visual range is in the high fre- 
quencies. They see by the light of 
X rays. They also seem to be able 
to m^e use of the radio frequ^icies 
to see, or at least to get some kind of 
sensory information. And they pick 
up most wavelengths in between, ex- 
cept that they don’t have a great deal 
of interest in the stuff between infra- 
red and ultraviolet What we like to 
call the visible spectrum.** 

“Wait a minute. Radio senses? 
Do you have any idea how long ra- 
dio waves are? If they’re gmng to 
get any information out of a single 
wave, they’ll need eyes, or receptors 
or whatever of gigantic uze. How 
*big are these being supposed to be?” 
“They could eat elejdiants for 
breakfast,” said Rawlins. 

“Intelligent life doesn’t come that 
big.” 

“What’s the limitation? This is a 
gas giant jdanet, all ocean, no grav- 
ity to sp^ oL piey float. They 
have no squai6-cul]« proUems.” 
“And a bunch of superwhales has 
developed a technc^gical culture?” 
Muller asked. “You won’t get me to 
believe — ” 

“They have,” said Rawlins. “1 told 
you, these were very alien aliens. 
They can’t build machinery them- 
selves. But they have slaves,” 

44 ^^h,” said Muller quietly. 

♦‘We’re only beginning to un- 
derstand this, and of course 1 don’t 
have much of the inside information 


myself, but it seems that these beings 
m^e use of lower life-forms, turning 
them essentially into radio-controlled 
robots. They’ll use anything with 
limbs and mobility. They started with 
certain animals of their own planet, 
a small dolphin-like form perhaps on 
the threshold of intdligence, and 
worked through them to achieve a 
space-drive. Then they got to neigh- 
boring {Janets, land planets, and took 
control of pseudo-primates, proto- 
chimps of some kind. They look for 
fing^. Manual dexterity counts a 
great deal to them. At present their 
sphere of influence covers some 
dghty light-years, and it i^ears to 
be spreading at an exponential rate.” 
Muller shook his head. “This is 
worse nonsense than the stuff you 
were handing me about a cure. Look, 
there’s a Hinting velocity for radio 
transmission, ri^? If they’re con- 
trdling flunkeys from eig^ light- 
years away, it’ll take ei^ty years for 
any command to reach its destina- 
tion. Every twitch of a muscle, every 
trifling movement — ” 

“They can leave their home 
world,” said Rawlins. 

“But if they’re so big — ” 
“They’ve used their ^ve beings to 
build gravity tanks. They also have 
a star drive. All colonies are run by 
overseers in orbit a few thousand 
kilom^ers up, floating in a simulated 
home-world environmimt It takes 
one overseer to run one planet” 
MuUn: closed his eyes a moment. 
The image came to him of these co- 
lossal, unimaginable beasts spreading 
through their distant galaxy, impress- 
ing ftTiimak of all sorts into service, 
for^g a captive society, vicariously

technological^ and drifting in orbit 
like spacebome whales to direct and 
coordinate the grandiose improbable 
enterprise, while masses of glossy pink 
protoplasm, fresh from the sea, 
bristling with perceptors functioning 
at both ends of the spectrum* Whis- 
pering to one another in pulses of 
X rays. Sending out orders via ra- 
dio. No, he thought. No. 

“Well,” he said at length, “what 
of it? They’re in another galaxy.” 

N ot any longer. They’ve impinged 
on a few of our outlying colo- 
nies. Do you know what they do 
when they find a human world? 
They station an orbiting overseer 
above it and take control of the col- 
onists. They find that humans make 
outstanding slaves. At the moment 
they have six of our worlds. They 
had a seventh, but we shot up their 
overseer. Now they make it much 
harder to do that. They just take 
control of our missiles as they home 
in, and throw them back.” 

“If you’re inventing this,” said 
Muller, “I’ll kill you!” 

“It’s true. I swear.” 

“When did this begin?” 

“Within the past year.” 

“And what happens? Do they just 
march right through our galaxy and 
turn us all into zombies?” 

“Boardman thinks we have one 
chance to prevent that.” 

“Which is?” 

Rawlins said, “The aliens don’t ap- 
pear to realize that we’re intelligent 
beings. We can’t communicate with 
them, you see. They function on a 
completely non-verbal level, some 
kind of telepathic system, and we’ve 


tried all sorts of ways to reach them, 
bombarding them with messages at 
every wavelength, without any flick- 
er of a sign that they’re receiving us. 
Boardman believes that if we could 
persuade them that we have — well, 
souls — they might leave us alone. 
God knows why he thinks so. It’s 
some kind of computer prediction. 
He feels that these aliens work on a 
consistent moral scheme, that they’re 
willing to grab any animals that look 
useful, but that they wouldn’t touch 
a species that’s on the same side of 
the intelligence boundary as they are. 
And if we could show them some- 
how — ” 

“They see that we have cities. That 
we have a star drive. Doesn’t that 
prove intelligence?” 

‘ 'Beavers make dams,” said Raw- 
lins. “But we don’t make treaties 
with beavers. We don’t pay repara- 
tions when we drain their marshes. 
We know that in some way a beaver’s 
feelings don’t count.” 

“Do we?” 

“I don’t want to argue philosophy 
with you,” Rawlins said hoarsely. 
“I’m trying to tell you what the situ- 
ation is. Boardman thinks that we 
really can get the radio beasts to 
leave our galaxy alone, if we show 
them that we’re closer to them in in- 
telligence th^ we are to their other 
slaves. If we get across to them that 
we have emotions, needs, ambitions, 
dreams.” 

Muller spat. “Hath not a Jew eyes? 
Hath not a Jew hands, organs, di- 
mensions, senses, affections, passions? 
If you prick us, do we not bleed?” 

“Like that, yes.” 

“How do we get this across to

them if they don’t speak a verbal 
language?” 

^Don’t you see?” Rawlins asked. 
“No, I — yes. Yes. God, yesl” 
“We have one man, out of all our 
billions, who doesn’t need words to 
communicate. He broadcasts his in« 
ner feelings. His souk We don’t know 
what frequency he uses, but they 
might” 

“Yes. Yes.” 

“And so Boardman wanted to ask 
you to do one more thing for man- 
kind. To go to these aliens.” 

“What makes you think 1 would 
lift a finger to keep all of man’s 
worlds from being swallowed up?” 
“Your help wouldn’t have to be 
voluntary,” Rawlins said. 

N ow it came flooding forth, the 
hatred, the anguish, the fear, 
the jealousy, the torment, the bitter- 
ness, the mockery, the loathing, the 
contempt, the despair, the vicious- 
ness, the fury, the desperation, the 
vehemence, the agitation, the grief, 
the pangs, the agony, the furor, the 
fire. Rawlins pulled bade as though 
depths of desolation. A trick, a trick, 
all a trick! Used again. Boardman’s 
tool. Muller blazed. He spoke only 
a few words aloud; the rest came 
from within, pouring out, the gates 
wide, nothing penned back, a torrent 
of anger. 

Wl;^ tiie wild spasm passed Mul- 
ler said, “Boardman would dump me 
onto the aliens whether 1 was willing 
to go or not?” 

“Yes. He said this was too impor- 
tant to allow you free dioice. Your 
wishes were irrdevant. The many 
against the one.” 


With deadly calm Muller said, 
“You’re part of this conspiracy. Why 
have you been telHng me this?” 

“I resigned.” 

“Of course.” 

“No, I mean it. Oh, 1 was part of 
it; 1 was going along with Boardman; 
yes, I was lying in everything I said 
to you. But 1 didn’t know the last 
part: that you wouldn’t be given 
any chmee. 1 had to pull out feere. 
1 couldn’t let them do this to you.” 
“V^ thoughtful. I now have two 
c^ems, di, N^?*l can let myself 
be dragged out of here to play cats- 
paw for Boardman again — or I 
can kill myself a minute from now 
and let mankind go to hell. Yes?” 
“Don’t talk like that,” Rawlins 
said edgily. 

“Why not? Those are my options. 
You were kind enough to tell me 
the real situation, and now 1 can re- 
act as 1 choose. You’ve handed me a 
death sentence, Ned.” 

“No.” 

“What else is there? To let myself 
be used again?” 

“You could — cooperate with 
Boardman,” Rawlins said. He licked 
his lips. 

“No!” 

“You aren’t being rational.” 

“No, I’m not And I don’t intend 
to start now. Assuming that it could 
affect humanity’s destiny in the 
dightest if I bcxxime ambassador to 
these radio people — and I don’t 
buy the idea at all — it would give 
me great pleasure to shirk my duty.

B oardman found all this distasteful, 
But it was also necessary, and 
he was not surprised that events had 
taken this turn. In his original an- 
alysis he had forecast two events of 
equal probability: that Rawlins would 
succeed in winning Muller out of 
the maze and that Rawlins would ul- 
timately rebel and blurt the truth. 
He was prepared for either. 

Now Boardman had advanced into 
the center of the maze, coming from 


thousand places here where death 
is quick and probably not painful. 
Then let Charles Boardman talk to 
the aliens himself. I — ” 

“Please don’t move, Dick,” said 
Boardman from a point about thirty 
meters behind him. 

V 




Zone F to follow Rawlins before the 
damage became irreparable. He could 
predict one of Muller’s likely re- 
sponses; suicide. Muller would never 
commit suicide out of despair, but 
he might do it by way of a vengeance. 
With fioardman were Ottavio, Davis, 
Reynolds, and Greenfield. Hosteen 
and the others were monitoring from 
outer zones. 

Muller turned. The look on his 
face was not easy to behold. 

‘Tm sorry, Dick,” Boardman said. 
“We had to do this.” 

“You have no shame at all, do 
you?” Muller asked. 

“Not where Earth is concerned.” 

“I realized that a long time ago. 
But I thought you were human, 
Charles. I didn’t comprehend your 
depths.” 

“I wish we didn’t have to do any 


of this, Dick. But we do. Come with 
us.” 

“No.” 

“You can’t refuse. The boy’s told 
you what’s at stake. We owe you 
more already than we can repay, 
Dick, but run the debt a little higher. 
Please.” 

“I’m not leaving Lemnos. I feel 
no sense of obligation to humanity. 
I won’t do your work.” 

“Dick — ” 

Muller said, “Fifty meters to the 
northwest of where I stand is a 
flame pit. I’m going to walk over and 
step into it. Within ten seconds there 
will be no more Richard Muller. One 
unfortunate calamity will cancel out 
another, and Earth will be no worse 
off than it was before I acquired my 
special ability.” 

“That’s childish. The last sin I’d 
ever imagine you committing.” 

“It was childish of me to dream 
of stars,” Muller said. “I’m simply 
being consistent. The galactics can eat 
you alive, Charles. I don’t care if 
they do. Won’t ^ou fancy being a 
slave? Somewhere under your skull 
you’ll still be there, screaming to be 
released, and the radio messages will 
tell you which arm to life, which leg 
to move. I wish I could last long 
enough to see that. But I’m going to 
walk into that flame pit.” 

Boardman said, “At least come 
out to Zone F with me. Let’s sit 
down quietly and discuss this over 
brandy.” 

“Side by side?” Muller laughed. 
“You’d vomit. You couldn’t bear it.” 
He took a shaky step toward the 
northwest. His big powerful body 
seemed shrunken and withered, noth-

ing but sinew stretching tighter 
over a yielding armature. He todr an- 
other step. Boardman watdied. 

Casually^ Boardman gestured with 
two flickiDg fingers. Greenfield and 
Reynolds pounced. 

C atlike they darted forth, ready for 
this, and cau^ Muller by the 
inner forearms. Boardman saw the 
grayness sweep over their faces as the 
impact of Muller’s Held got to them. 
Muller struggled, heaved, tried to 
break loose. Davis and 0^vk> were 
upon him now too. A stungun would 
have been easier, Boardman reflect- 
ed. But stunguns w^e ri^, smne- 
times, on humans. They hstd been 
known to send hearts into wild run- 
always. They had no defibrillator 
here. 

A moment more and Muller was 
forced to his knees. 

"'Pisarm him,” Boardman said. 
Ottavio and Davis held him. Rey- 
nolds and Greenfield seardied him. 
From a pocket Greenfield pulled 
forth the deadly little windowed 
globe. “That’s all he seems to be 
carrying,” Greenfield said. 

“Che^ carefully.” 

They checked. Meanwhile Muller 
remained motionless, his face frozen, 
his eyes stony. It was the posture 
and the exfvession of a man at the 
headsman’s block. At length Green- 
field looked up again. “Nothing.” 
Muller said, “One of my left up- 
per molars contains a secret com- 
partment full of carriphage. I’U count 
to ten and bite hard, and I’ll melt 
away before your eyes.” 

Greenfield swung around and 
grabbed Muller’s jaws. 


Boardman said, “Leave him alone. 
He’s jddng.” 

“But how do we knew — ” Green- 
field began. 

“Let him be. Step back.” Board- 
man gestured. “Sti^ five meters 
away from him. Don’t go near him 
unless he move^.” 

They stepped away, obviously 
grateful to get back from the full 
thrust of Muller’s field. Boardman, 
fifteen meters frmn him, could feel 
faint strands of pain. He went no 
closer. 

“You can stand up now,” Board- 
man said. “But please don’t try to 
move. 1 regret this, Dick.” 

Muller got to his feet. His face 
was black with hatred, but he said 
nothing, nor did he move. 

“If we have to,” Boardman said, 
we’ll ta^ you in a webfoam cradle 
and carry you out of the maze to 
the ship. We’ll keep you in foam 
from then cm. You’ll be in foam when 
you meet the aliens. You’ll be abso- 
lutely heh’less. 1 would hate to do 
that to you, Dick. The other choice 
is willing cooperation. Go with us 
of your own free will to the ship. 
Do what we ask of you. Help us 
this last time.” 

“May your intestines rust,” said 
Muller almost casually. “May you 
live a thousand years with wcmxds eat- 
ing you. May you choke on your own 
smugness and never die.” 

“Help us. Willingly.” 

Muller’s reply was dose to a snarl. 

Boardman sighed. This was an em- 
barrassment. He looked toward Ot- 
tavio. 

“The webfoam,” he said. 

Rawlins, who had been standing as 

IF

though in a trance, burst into sud- 
den activity. He darted forward, 
seized Reynold’s gun from its hol- 
ster,, ran toward Muller and pressed 
the weapon into his hand. “There,” 
he said thickly. “Now you’re in 
charge.” 

M uller studied the gun as though 
he had never seen one before, 
but his surprise lasted only a frac- 
tion of a second. He slipped his 
hand around its comfortable butt and 
fingered the firing stud. It was a fa- 
miliar models only sUgfhtly changed 
from the ones he had known. In a 
quick flaring burst he could kill them 
Or himself. 

He stepped back so they could not 
come upon him from the rear. Then 
he moved the gun in an arc of some 
270 degrees, taking them all in. 

“Stand close together,” he said. 
*The six of you. Stand one meter 
apart in a straight row and keep 
your hands out where 1 can see them 
at all times.” 

He enjoyed the black glowering 
look that Boardman threw at Ned 
Rawlins. The boy seemed dazed, 
flushed, confused, a figure in a 
dream. Muller waited patiently as the 
six men arranged themselves accord- 
ing to his orders. He was surprised at 
his own calmness. 

“You look unhappy, Charles,” he 
said. “How old are you now, eighty 
years? You’d like to live that other 
seventy, eighty, ninety, I guess. You 
have your career planned, and the 
plan doesn’t include dying on Lem- 
nos. Stand still, Charles. And stand 
straight. You won’t win any pity 
from me by trying to look old and 


sagging. I kngw that dodge. You’re 
as healthy as 1 am, beneath the phony 
flab.” 

Boardman said raggedly, ”lf it’ll 
make you feel better, Dick, kill me. 
And then go aboard the ship and do 
what we want you to do. I’m ex- 
pendable.” 

“1 almost think you mean that,” 
Muller said wonderingly. “You crafty 
old bastard, you’re offering a trade. 
Your life for my cooperationi But 
where’s the quid pro quo? I don’t ein- 
joy killing. It won’t soothe me at all 
to bum you down. I’ll still have my 
curse.” 

“The offer stands.” 

“Rejected,” Muller said. “If I 
kill you, it won’t be as part of any 
deal. But I’m much more likely to 
kill myself. You know, Fm a de- 
cent man at heart Somewhat unsta:- 
ble, yes, and who’s to blame me for 
that? But decent I’d rather use this 
gim on me than on you. I’m the 
one who’s suffering. I can end it” 
“You could have ended it at any 
time in the past nine years,” Board- 
man pointed out “But you survived. 
You devoted all your ingenuity to 
staying alive in this murderous place.” 
“Ah. Yes. But that was different! 
An abstract challenge: man agtdnsi 
the maze. But if 1 kill myself now, 
thwart you. 1 put the thumb to the 
nose with all of mankind watching. 
I’m the indispensable man, you sa^ 
What better way, then, to pay, man- 
kind back for my pain?” 

“We regretted your suffering,” 
said Boardman. 

“I’m sure you wept bitterly for me. 
But that was all you did. You let me 
go creeping away, diseased, corrupt. 


THE MAN IN THE MAZE

unclean. Now comes the release. Not 
really suicide: revenge.” Muller 

smiled. He turned the gun to finest 
beam and let its muzzle rest against 
his chest. A touch of the finger, now. 
His eyes raked their faces. Rawlins 
looked deep in shock. Only Board- 
man was animated with concern and 
fright. “1 could kill you first, I sup- 
pose, Charles. As a lesson to our 
young friend: the wages of deceit is 
death. But no. That would spoil ev- 
erything. You have to live, Charles. 
To go back to Earth admit 
that you let the indispensable man 
dip throu^ your grasp. What a 
blotch on your careerl” 

His finger tightened on the stud. 
“Now,” he «ud. “Quickly.” 

“iVo/” Boardman screamed. “For 

the love of — ” 

“Man,” said Muller, and laughed, 
and did not fire. His arm relaxed. He 
tossed the weapon contemptuoudy to- 
ward Boardman. It landed almost at 
his feet. 

“Foam!” Boardman cried. “Quick!** 
“Don’t bother,” said Muller. “I’m 
yours.” 

xvn 

F eeling that he was in disgrace, 
Rawlins k^t away from the 
others on the nearly silent outward 
march. He conddered his career in 
mins. He had Jeopardized the lives of 
his companions and the success of 
die missioa. Yet it had been worth 
it, he felt. A time comes when a man 
his stand against what he be- 
lieves to be wrong. 

The simple moral pleasure that he 
took in that was balanced and over- 


balanced by the knowledge that he 
had acted naively, romantically, fool- 
ishly. He could not bear to face 
Boardman now. He thought more 
than once of letting one of the dead- 
ly traps of these outer zones have 
him. But that too, he decided, would 
be naive, romantic, and fooli^. 

He watched Muller striding ahead, 
tall, proud, all tensions resolved, all 
doubts crystallized. And he wondered 
a thousand times why Muller had 
given back the gun. 

Boardman finally explained it to 
him as they camped for the ni^t in 
a precarious plaza near the outward 
side of Zone G. 

*lx>ok at me,” Boardman said. 
“What’s the matter? Why can’t you 
look at me?” 

“Don’t toy with me, Charies. Get 
it over with. The tonguelashing. The 
sentence.” 

“It’s all right, Ned. You helped us 
get what we wanted. Why should I 
be angry?” 

“But the gun — I gave him the 
gun — 

“Confusion of ends and means 
again. He’s coming with us. He’s do- 
ing what we wanted him to do. 
Thaf s counts.” 

Floundering, Rawlins said, “And if 
he had killed himself? Or us?” 

“He wouldn’t have done either.” 

“You can say that, now. But for 
the first moment, when he held the 
gun — ” 

“No,” Boardman said. “I told you 
earlier: we’d work on his sense of 
honor. Which we had to reawaken. 
You did that. Look, here I am, the 
brutal agent of a brutal and amoral 
society, right? And I confirm aU of 

IF 


150 



Muller’s worst thoughts about man- 
kind. Why should he help a tribe of 
wolves? And here you are: young 
and innocent, full of hope and 
dreams. You remind him of the man- 
kind he once served, before the cyn- 
icism corroded him. You demonstrate 
sympathy, love for a fellow man, the 
willingness to make a dramatic ges- 
ture for the sake of rigihteousness. 
You show Muller that there’s small 
hope in humanity. See? You defy me 
and give him a gun and make him 
master of the situation. He could do 
the obvious and bum us down. He 
could do the slightly less obvious, 
and bum himself. Or he could match 
your gesture with one of his own, 
top it, commit a deliberate act of 
renunciation, express his revived 
sense of moral superiority. He does 
it. He tosses away the gun. You were 
vital, Ned. You were the instrument 
through which we won him.” 

Rawlins said, “You make it sound 
so ugly when you speU it out that 
way. As if you had planned even 
this.” 

Boardman smiled. 

“Did you?” Rawlins demanded 
suddenly. “No. You couldn’t have 
calculated all those twists and turns. 
Now, after the fact, you’re trying to 
claim credit for ha^g en^eered it 
all But I saw you in the moment I 
handed him the gun. There was fear 
on your face, and anger. You weren’t 
at ^ sure what he was going to do. 
Only when everything worked out 
could you claim it went according to 
plan. I can see right through you, 
Charles!” 

“How delightful to be transparent,” 
Boardman said gaily. 


C arefully they traced their outward 
path, but they met few challenges 
and no serious dangers. Quickly they 
went toward the ship. 

They gave Muller a forward cabin, 
well apart from the quarters of the 
crew. He was withdrawn, subdued, 
self-contained; an ironic smile often 
played on his lips, and his eyes dis- 
played a glint of contempt much of 
the time. But he was willing to do as 
they directed. He had had his mo- 
ment of supremacy; now he was 
theirs. 

Hosteen and his men bustled 
through the liftoff preparations. Mul- 
ler remained in his cabin. Boardman 
went to him, alone, unarmed. He 
could make noble gestures too. 

They faced each other across a 
low table. Muller waited, silent, his 
face cleansed of emotion. Boar^an 
said after a long moment, “I’m grate- 
ful to you, Dick.” 

“Save it.” 

“I don’t mind if you despise me. 
I did what 1 had to do. So did the 
boy. And now so will you.” 

He sat quite close to Muller. The 
emanation hit him broadside, but he 
deliberately remained in place. That 
wave of despair welling out to him 
made him feel a thousand years old. 
The decay of the body, the crum- 
bling of ih& soul, the heat-death of 
the galaxy . the coming of win- 
ter... emptiness . ashes. ... 

“When we reach Earth,” said 
Boardman crisply, . “I’ll put ypu 
through a detah^ briefing. Yop^ 
come out of it knowing as much 
about the radio people as we do, 
which isn’t saying a great deal. After 
that you’ll be on your own. “Is there 

151 


THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



aayone you’d like me to have waiting 
for you when we dock Earthside?” 

“No.” 

“1 can send woid ahead. There 
are people ^o’ve never stopped lov- 
ing you» Dick. They’ll be Aere if 1 
ask them.” 

Muller said slowly, “1 see the 
strain in your eyes, Charles. You feel 
the nearness of me, and it’s ripping 
you apart. You feel it in your gut In 
your forehead. Back of your breast- 
bone. Your face is going gray. Your 
cheeks are sagging. You’ll sit here if 
it kills you, yes, because that’s your 
st)1e, but it’s hek for you. If there’s 
anyone on Earth who never stopped 
loving me, Charles, the least 1 can do 
is spare her from bell. I don’t want 
to meet anyone. 1 don’t want to see 
anyone. 1 don’t want to talk to any- 
one.” 

“As you wish,” said Boardman. 
Beads of sweat hung from his bushy 
brows and dn^>ped to his cheeks, 
“^eihaps youll change your mind 
when you’re close to Ear&.” 

“I’ll never be close to Earth again,” 
Muller said. 

XVUI 

H e spent three weeks absorbing all 
that was known of the giant 
CKtragalactic beings. They gave him 
quarters in a bunker on Luna and he 
lived quietly beneath Copernicus, 
moving like a robot through steely 
gray corridors lit by warm gbwing 
torches. They showed him all the 
cubes. They ran off a variety of re- 
coostructs in every sensory mode. 
Muller listened. He absorbed. He said 
very little. 


They kept well away from him, as 
they had on the voyage from Lem- 
nos. Whole days passed in which he 
saw no human being. When they 
came to him, they remained at dis- 
tances of ten meters and more. 

The exertion was Boardman, who 
visited him three times a week, and 
made a point always of coming well 
within the pain range. Muller found 
that contemptible. Boardman seemed 
to be patroniziqg him with this vol- 
untary and wholly unnecessary sub- 
missbn io discomfort. “1 wish you’d 
keep away,” Muller said to him on 
the fifth visit. “We can talk by 
screen. Or you could stay by the 
door.” 

“1 don’t mind the close contact.” 

“1 do,” said Muller. “Has it ever 
occurred to you that I’ve begun to , 
find manViivI SiS odioUS as fpa qkind ' 

finds me? The redr of your meaty 
body, Charles — it goes into my 
nostrils like a spike. Not just you, 
all the others. Sickening. Hideous. 
Even the look of your faces. The 
pores. The stupid gaping mouths. The 
ears. Look at a human ear closely 
some time, Charles. Have you ever 
seen anything more repulsive than 
that pink wrinkled cup? You all dis- 
gust me!” 

“I’m sorry you feel that way,” 
Boardman said. 

The bii^ng went on and on. Mul- 
ler was ready after the first week to 
undertake his assignment, but no, 
they had to feed him all the data in 
the bank, first. He absorbed the in- 
formation with twitchy impatience. 
A shadow of his old sdf remained 
to find it fascinating, a challenge 
worth accepting. He would go. He 


152 


IF 



would serve as before. He would hon- 
or his obligation. 

At last they said he could depart. 

From Luna they took him by ion- 
drive to a point outside the orbit of 
Mars, where they transferred him to 
a warp-drive ship already pro- 
grammed to kick him to the edge of 
the galaxy. Alone. 

From the cabin of his small sleek 
ship he watched the technicians drift- 
ing in space, getting ready to sever 
the transfer line. Then they were re- 
turning to their own ship. Now he 
heard from Boardman, a final mes- 
sage, a Boardman special, inspira- 
tional, go forth and do your duty for 
mankind, et cetera, et cetera. Muller 
thanked him graciously for his words. 

The communications channel was 
cut. 

Moments later Muller entered 
warp. 

T he aliens had taken possession 
of three solar systems on the 
fringes of the galactic lens, each star 
having two Earth-settled planets. 
Muller’s ship was aimed at a green- 
ish-gold star whose worlds had been 
colonized only forty years before. 
The fifth planet, dry as iron, be- 
longed to a Central Asian coloniza- 
tion society that was trying to es- 
tablish a series of pastoral cultures 
where nomad virtues could be prac- 
ticed. The sixth, with a more typical- 
ly Earthlike mixture of climates and 
environments, was occupied by rep- 
resentatives of half a dozen coloniza- 
tion societies, each on its own con- 
tinent. The relations between these 
groups, often intricate and touchy, 
had ceased to matter within the past 

THE MAN IN THE MAZE 


twelve months, for both planets now 
were under control of extragalactic 
overseers. 

Muller emerged from warp twenty 
light-seconds from the sixth planet 
His ship automatically went into an 
observation orbit, and the scanners 
began to report. Screens showed him 
the surface picture; via template ovtt- 
lay he was able to compare the con- 
figurations of the outposts below 
with the pattern as it had been prior 
to the alien conquest. The amplified 
images were quite interesting. The 
original settlements appeared on his 
screen in violet, and the recent ex- 
tensions in red; Muller observed that 
about each of the colonies, regardless 
of its original ground plan, there had 
sprouted a network of angular streets 
and jagged avenues. Instinctively he 
recognized the geometries as ^en. 

In orbit, seven thousand kilometers 
above the sixth planet, was a glisten- 
ing capsule, slightly longer on one 
axis than on the other, which had 
about the mass of a large interstellar 
transport ship. Muller found a similar 
capsule in orbit about the fifth world. 
The overseers. 

It was impossible for him to open 
communications with either of these 
capsules, or with the planets beyond. 
All channels were blocked. He twist- 
ed dials fitfully for more than an 
hour, ignoring the irritable responses 
of the ship’s brain, which kept telHng 
him to give up the idea. At last he 
conceded. 

He brought his ship close to the 
nearer orbiting capsule. To his sur- 
prise the ship remained under his 
control. Destructive missiles that had 
come this close to alien overseers had 

153 



deen commandeered; but he was able 
to navigate. A hopeful sign? Was he 
under scan, and was the alien id>le 
to distingifLsh him from a hostile 
weapon? Or was he being ignored? 

At a distance of one million kilom- 
^ers he matdied velocities with the 
alien satellite and put his ship in a 
poking orbit around it He mitered 
his drop-capsule. He ejected himself 
and slid from his ship into darkness. 

N ow the alien seized him. There 
was no doubt The drop-cap- 
sule was pro gramme d for a minimum- 
expenditure orbit that woidd bring it 
skimming past the alien in due time, 
but Muller swifdy discovered that he 
was debating from that orbit Devia- 
tions are never accidental. His cap- 
sule was acoebcadJag beyond the pro- 
gram, whidi meant diat it had teen 
grasped and was being drawn for- 
ward. He accepted that. He was Idly 
calm, expecting nodiing and pre- 
pared for everything. The drop-cap- 
sule eased down. He saw the gleam- 
ing bulk of the alien satelUte show. 

Skin to metal skin, the vehicles 
met and toudied and joined. 

A hatch slid open. 

He drifted within. 

His capsule came to rest on a 
broad platform in an immense cav- 
ernous room hundreds of meters long, 
high, and broad. Fully suited, Mul- 
ler stepped from it. He activated his 
gravity pads; for, as he antidpated, 
gravity in here was so dose to null 
that the pull was imperceptible. In the 
blackness he saw only a faint pur- 
plish glow. Against a backdrop of ut- 
ter silence he heard a resonant boom- 
ing sound, like an enormously am- 


plified sigh, shuddering through the 
struts and trusses of the satellite. De- 
spite his gravity pads he felt dizzy; 
beneath him the flo(^ rolled. Through 
his mind went a sensation like the 
throbbing of the sea; great waves 
slammed ragged beaches; a mass of 
water stirred and groaned in its glob- 
al cavity; the world shivered beneath 
the burden. Muller felt a chih that 
his suit could not counteract. An ir- 
resistible force drew him. Hesitantly 
he moved, relieved and surprised to 
see that his limbs still obeyed his 
commands, though he was not entire- 
ly their master. The awareness of 
something vast nearby, something 
heaving and pulsating and sighing, re- 
mained with him. 

He walked down a night-drowned 
boulevard. He came to a low railing, 
a dull red line against the deep dark- 
ness, and pressed his leg against it, 
ke^ang contact with it as he moved 
forward. At one point he slipped and 
hit the railing widi his dbow and 
heard the dang of metal traveling 
through the entire structure. Blurred 
edioes drifted back to him. As though 
walking the maze he passed through 
corridors and hatches, across inter- 
loddng compartments, over bridges 
that spanned dark abysses, down slop- 
ing ramplike debouchments into lofty 
chambers whose ceilings were dimly 
visible. Here he moved in blind con- 
fidence, fearing nothing. He could 
barely see. He had no vision of the 
total structure of this satellite. He 
could scarcely imagine the purpose of 
these inner partitions. 

From that hidden giant presence 
c^e silent waves', an ever-intenrify- 
ing pressure. He trembled in its grip.

Still he moved on, until now he was 
in some central gallery, and by a 
thin blue glow he was able to dis- 
cern levels dwindling below him, and 
far beneath his balcony a broad tank, 
and within the tank something spar- 
kling, something huge. 

“Here I am,” he said. “Richard 
Muller. Earthman.” 

He gripped the railing and peered 
downward. Did the great beast stir 
and shift? Did it grunt? Did it call 
to him in a language he understood? 
He heard nothing. But he felt a great 
deal. 

He felt bis soul escaping through 
his pores. 

The drain was unrelenting. Down 
in the pit the monster tapped his 
spirit, opened petcocks of neural en- 
ergy, drew forth, demanded more, 
drew that too. 

“Go on,” Muller said, and the 
echoes of his voice danced around 
him. “Drink! What’s it like? A bit- 
ter brew? Drink!” 

His knees buckled. He sagged for- 
ward. He pressed his forehead to the 
cold railing. He yidded himself in 
glittering droplets. He gave up first 
love and first disa^^intment, April 
rain, fever and ache, pride and hope, 
the scent of sweat and the touch of 
flesh, warmth and ccdd, sweet and 
sour, the thunder of music, the music 
of thunder, silken hair knotted be- 
tween his fingers, lines scratched in 
spongy soil, snorting stallions, glitter- 
ing schools of tiny fish, the towers of 
Newer Chicago, the brothels of Un- 
der New Orleans, know, milk, wine, 
hunger, fire, pain, sleep, sorrow, ap- 
ples, dawn, tears, Bach, sizzling 
grease, the laughter of old men, the 


sun on the horizon, the moon on the 
sea, ecstasy, grief, salt, artichokes, 
green fields, the light of other stars, 
soft thighs, whirling dancers, vision 
cubes, traaq>ortation pods, cold gin, 
crumbling l^ks, Sunday mornings, 
the fumes of rodcet fuel, summer 
flowm on a glacier’s flank, and much 
more. He gave it all. He waited for 
an answer, and none came to him, 
and when be was wholly empty he 
lay face downward, drained, hollow, 
staring blindly into the abyss. 

XDC 

W hen he was able to leave, he 
left The hatch opened to pass 
his drop-capsule, and it rose toward 
his ship. Shortly he was in warp. He 
slept most of the way. In the vicinity 
of Antares he cut in the override, 
took command of the ship^ and filed 
for a change of ccuise. There was 
no need to return to Earfli. The mon- 
itor staflon recorded bis request, 
checked ;rbu1inely to see thai the 
channel was clear, ahH allowed him to 
proceed at pnce' to L^nnos. Muller 
entered waip again instantly. 

When he emerged, not far from 
Lemnos, he found another ^p al- 
ready in orbit and waiting for him. 
He started to go about his business 
anyway, but the other ddp insisted 
on mal^g contact. Muller accepted 
the communication. 

“This is Ned Rawlins,” a strangely 
quiet voice said. “Why have you 
changed your flight plans?” 

“Does it matter? I’ve done my 
job.” 

“You haven't filed a report” 

*Tm reporting now, then. I visited

the alien. We had a pleasant^ friend- 
ly chat. Then it let me go home. 
Now Fm almost home. End of re- 
port.” 

“What are you going to do now?” 
“Go home,” I said. “This is home.” 
‘Xemnos?” 

“Lemnos.” 

“Dick, let me come aboard. Give 
me ten minutes with you — in per- 
son. Please don’t say no.” 

“I don’t say no,” Muller replied. 
Soon a small craft detached itself 
from the other ship and matched ve- 
locities with his. Patiently Muller al- 
lowed the rendezvous to take place. 
Rawlins stepped into his ship and 
shed his helmet. He looked pale, 
drawn, older. They faced one an- 
other for a long silent moment. Raw- 
lins advanced and took Muller’s wrist 
in greeting. 

“I never thought I’d see you again, 
Dick,” he began. “And I wanted to 
tell you — ” 

He stopped. 

“Yes?” Muller asked. 

“I don’t feel it,” said Rawlins. 
“/ don*t feel Ur 
“What?” 

“You. Your field. Look, I’m right 
next to you. I don’t feel a thing. 
All that nastiness, the pain, the de- 
spair — it isn’t coming throughi” 
“The alien drank it all,” said Mul- 
ler calmly. “I’m not surprised. My 
soul left my body. Not all of it was 
put back.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

“I could feel it soaking up every- 
thing that was within me. 1 knew it 
was changing me. Net deliberately. It 
was just an incidental alteration. A 
byproduct.” 


Rawlins said slowly, “You knew it, 
then. Even before I came on board. 
And yet you want to return to the 
maze. Why?” 

‘It’s home.” 

“Earth’s your home, Dick. There’s 
no reason why you shouldn’t go back. 
You’ve been cured.” 

“Yes,** said Muller. “A happy end- 
ing to my doleful story. I’m fit to con- 
sort with humanity again. My re- 
ward for nobly risking my life a sec- 
ond time among, aliens. How neatly 
done! But is humanity fit to consort 
with me?” 

“Don’t go down there, Dick. 
You’re being irrational now. Charles 
sent me to get you. He’s terribly 
proud of you. We all are. It would 
be a big mistake to lock yourself 
away in the maze now.” 

“Go back to your own ship, Ned,” 
Muller said. 

“If you go into the maze, so will 
I.” 

“I’ll kill you if you do. I want to 
be left alone, Ned, do you under- 
stand that? I’ve done my job. My 
last job. Now I retire. Purged of my 
nightmares.” Muller forced a thin 
smile. “Don’t come after me, Ned. I 
trusted you, and you would have be- 
trayed me. Everything else is inci- 
dental. Leave my ship now. We’ve 
said all that we need to say to each 
other, I think, except good-bye. Re- 
member me to Charles.” 

“Don’t do thisl” 

“There’s something down there I 
don’t want to lose,” Muller said. “I’m 
going to claim it now. Stay away. 
All of you. Stay away. I’ve learned 
the truth about Earthmen. Will you 
go now?”

Silently Rawlins suited up. As he 
stuped tluoiigh the hatch. Mallei 
said, 'Tm ^iad you wei» the last 
one 1 saw. Somehow it was easier 
that way.” 

Rawlins vanished through the 
hatch. 

A short while laler Muller pro- 
grammed his ship for a hypertolic 
orbit on a twenty-minute di^y, got 
into his drop<i4>itde, and re^ed 
himself for the descent to Lemnos. 
It was a quick drop and a good 
landing. He came down right in the 
impact ^ea, two kitomctere from the 
gateway to the maze. The sun was 
high and bright. MoUer walked brisk- 
ly toward the maze. 

He had done what they wanted. 

Now he was going home. 

44 T Te*s still making gestures,” 

-TX Boardman said. “He'll come 
out of there.” 

“I don’t think so,*’ relied Rawlins. 
“He meant that.” 

“You stood nest to him, and you 
felt nothing?” 

“Nothing. He doesn’t have it any 
more.” 

“He’ll come out, then,” Boardman 
said. ^'We’U watch him, and when 
he asks to be taken off Lemnos, well 
take him off. Sooner or later hell 
need other pec^le again. He’s been 
throii^ so mudi that he needs to 
think everything throng and 1 guess 
he sees tte maze as the best place 
for that He isn't ready to fdunge 
back into normal life again. Give 
him two years, three, fom. Hell come 
out. The two sets of aliens have can- 
cried each other’s work on him, and 
he’s fit to rejoin society.” 

THE MAN IN THE MAZE 


“1 don’t think so,” Rawlins said 
quietly. “I don't think it cancried out 
so evenly. Chades, 1 don’t think he’s 
human at all, any more.” 

Boardman lau^ied. ^hall we bet? 
ni o^er five to one that Muller 
comes out of the maze voluntarily 
widun five years.*’ 

"Wefl — *• 

“It’s a bet, then.” 

Rawlins the older man’s of- 
fice. Night had fiiUen. He crossed the 
bridge outside the building. In an 
hour he'd be dining with someone 
warm and soft and willing, who was 
awed beyond measure by her liaison 
frith the famous Ned Rafriins. She 
was a good listener, who coaxed him 
for tales of daring deeds and nodded 
gravriy as he ^ke cA the challenges 
ahead. S^e was ribo good in bed. 

He paused on the bridge to look 
upward at the stars. 

A million million blazing points of 
Ught shimmered in the sky. Out there 
lay Lemnos, and Beta Hydri IV, and 
the wodds occupied by the radio be- 
ings, and all man’s dominion, and 
even, invisible but real, the home 
galaxy of the o/Aers. Out there lay a 
iabyrinth in a broad plain, and a for- 
est of spongy trees hundreds of me- 
ters high, a thousand planets 
{Wanted with the young cities of 
Eardunen, and a tank of strangeness 
orbiting a conquaed world. In the 
tank lay somethiog unbearably alien. 
On the thousand Janets lived wor- 
ried men fearing the future. Under 
the spongy trees walked graceful si- 
ksrt creatures with many arms. In 
the maze dweUed a . man. 

Perhaps, Rawlins thou^t, I’ll visit 
Muller in a year or two. 

157 



It was too early to tell how the 
patterns would form. No one yet 
knew how the radio people were re- 
acting, if at all^ to the things they 
had learned from Richard Muller. 
The role of the Hydrans, the efforts 
of men in their own ^fense, the 
coming forth of Muller from the 
maze, these were mysteries, shifting, 
variable. It was exciting and a little 
frightening to think that he would 
live through the time of testing that 
lay ahead. 

He crossed the bridge. He watched 
starships shattering the darkness over- 
head. He stood motionless, feeling the 
pull of the stars. All the universe 
tugged at him, each star exerting its 
finite power. The glow of the heav- 
ens dazzled him. Beckoning pathways 
lay open. He thought of the man in 
the maze. He thought too of the girl 
awaiting him. 

S uddenly he was Dick Muller, once 
also twenty-four years old, with 
the galaxy his for the asking. Was it 
any different for you, he wondered? 
What did you feel when you looked 
up at the stars? Where did it hit you? 
Here. Here. Just where it hits me. 
And you went out there. And found. 
And lost And found something else. 
Do you remember, Dick, the way 
you once felt? Tonight in your windy 
maze, what will you think about? 
Will you remember? 

Why did you turn away from us, 
Dick? 

What have you become? 

He hurried to the girl who waited 
for him. They sipped young wine, 
tart, electric. They smiled through a 
candle’s flickering glow. Later her 


softness yielded to him, and still later 
they stood close together on a bal- 
cony looking out over the greatest 
of all men’s cities. Lights stretched 
toward infinity, rising to meet those 
other lights above. He slipped his 
arm around her, put his hand on her 
bare flank, held her against him. 

She said, ‘‘How long do you stay 
this time?” 

“Four more days.” 

“And when wii you come back?” 
“When the job’s done.” 

“Ned, will you ever rest? Will 
you ever say you’ve had enough, that 
you won’t go out any longer, that 
you’ll take one planet and stick to 
it?” 

“Yes,” he said vaguely. *T suppose. 
After a while.” 

“You don’t mean it. You’re just 
saying it. None of you ever settle 
down.” 

“We can’t,” he murmured. “We 
keep going. There are always more 
worlds . new suns. ...” 

“You want too much. You want 
the whole universe. It’s a sin, Ned. 
You have to accept limits.” 

“Yes,” he said. “You’re right. I 
know you’re right.” His fingers trav- 
eled over satin-smooth flesh. She 
trembled. He said, “We do what we 
have to do. We try to learn from 
the mistakes of others. We serve our 
cause. We attempt to be honest with 
ourselves. How else can it be?” 

“The man who went back into 
the maze — ” 

“ — is happy,” Rawlins said. “He’s 
following his chosen course.” 

““He must hate us terribly to turn 
his back on the whole universe like 
that.” 


158 


IF 



“He’s beyond hate,” Rawlins said. 
“Somehow. He’s at peace. Whatever 
he is.” 

^^Whateverr 

“Yes,” he said gently. When I see 
you again, Dick, I have much to tell 
you, he thought. 

She said, “Why did he lock himself 
into the maze again, Ned?” 


“For the same reason that he went 
among aliens in the first place. For 
the reason that it all happened.” 
“And that reason was?” 

“He loved mankind,” Rawlins 
said. It was as good an epitaph as 
any. He held the girl tightly. But he 
left before dawn. END

Dear Editor: 

In reply to your query concerning 
the reaction to occasionally printing 
a hit of fantasy, 1 would like to cast 
an affirmatiye vote. The reason, I 
think, that pure fantasy magazines 
such as Beyond and Unknown failed 
was that there were too few of us 
who enjoyed or could appreciate fine 
fantasy writing. Now I believe there 
is a new type of readership, brought 
about by the Eing trilogy and the 
Conan tales published in pocketbook 
form, that would certainly welcome 
more fantasy writing. After all, 
weVe had fine science-fiction writers 
turn out great fantasy; people like 
Robert Bloch (That Hell-Bound 
Train) y Jack Sharkey (It* 8 Magic, 
You Dopel), and Fritz Leiber (the 
Grey Mouser series). Really, weVe 
had fantasy with us in the guise of 
science fiction, in the form of Stur- 
geon, R. A. Lafferty and the recent 
Harlan Ellison. Perhaps you could 
print Michael Moorcock’s Elric 
stories in the up-coming Internation- 
al Science Fiction (and Fantasy?) 
Magazine. I’ve enjoyed reading If 
for many years and the addition of 
fantasy will make If a better maga- 
zine by expanding the subjects that 
your writers can write about. More 
fantasy and more James Blish. — 
George Kelley, 24D 69th Street, Ni- 
agara Falls, New York, 14304. 


Dear Editor: 

I am not a constant reader of 
science-fiction magazines, but some- 
times while in a bookshop I occasion- 
ally buy one or two from the paper- 
back counter. Likewise, I sometimes 
get them from abroad from England. 
The other day I picked up the De- 
cember 1967 issue of If and liked 
some of the stories. One thing I did 
not like was the first paragraph of 
the article by your man Lin Garter, 
presumably in Europe. Writing 
about the popularity of science-fic- 
tion in various countries he men- 
tions Russia . • which word for 
some obscure reason (or is it) is 
printed in italics, though the names 
of the other countries are printed 
in other type. It should of course be 
the Soviet Union. He uses the term 
Iron Curtain and by doing, so is ob- 
viously very prejudiced against that 
country. If Garter has a bias either 
from religious or political reason, 
then that is his own affair and I 
don’t think that it should intrude 
into your magazine. New Zealand 
is many thousands of miles away 
from the Soviet Union but even so. 
I’ll give him a few facts to bring 
him up-to-date. Please forward them 
on to him in Europe. 

The Soviet Union has Intourist 
offices in many of the big cities in 


160 



Euroi>e and these specifically cater 
for foreigners wanting to enter that 
country. If he had been in London 
say, he could have gone ekmg to the 
Intourist office there and booked a 
passage, either a Baltic line ship 
which operates between London and 
Leningrad or flown in one of the 
big Soviet jets from London airport 
to LeninigTad or Moscow. He would 
have had very little tronble with his 
viaa, always providing of coarse, 
<fthat his nose was clean’’. Many 
hundreds of thousands of foreigners 
(induding some thousands of Amer- 
icans) visit the Soviet Union 
throughout the year; and the trend 
is growing. The main problem is 
hotel accommodation. Some thou- 
sands of Soviet citizens visit other 
countries as well. Some few weeks 
ago 1 saw on television a British 
documentary made in conjunction 
with the ^viet television people, 
a hour long prog^ram on Siberia 
and particularly about ^'science 
city,” Novoeiibirsk. And very in- 
formative it was; no “Iron Curtain” 
there, brother. 

Even in little New Zealand we 
have seen the Bolshoi ballet and the 
Georgian dancers and others. And 
we, are so far away from the main 
spring of world culture . except 
of course, the American effort in 
Vietnam . that surdy you must 
have seen far noore <rf Soviet art 
and culture in the United States 
than we have seen in New Zealand. 
One point comes to mind as regards 
an iron curtain; some years ago ar- 
rangements had ibeen made between 
an American entrepreneur and a 
Soviet cultural organizatkm to visit 
the .United States and perform in 
the major cities, of the Red Army 
choir. Everything, had been settled 
and then Washington intervened and 


although the concert tickets had been 
sold out in the plao^ where the 
choir were to sing, dt all had to be 
canceled. The reason? The American 
government didn’t wiant the choir to 
sing in their Red Army uniforms as 
they had done in every other country 
they had sung in, and that the Red 
Army could say ihat they’d been on 
American soil. Tut, tut, how childish 
can they he? 

As (hnpMed in my opening para- 
graph, I am not an addict of scdence- 
fictioQ but very interested in space 
research and its discipimes and 1 am 
a senior member of the British In- 
terplanetary Society, London and 
also a member of two local (NZ) 
societies who publish technical re- 
ports. 

As a tail end. Just remember one 
thing; Scdence of any discipline is 
universal and for all mankind, and 
knows no boundaries, XH>litic3 or re- 
ligion. So cut out the “Iron CuTtain” 
prejudice and propaganda. — Wil- 
liam Hope Fenn, P.O. Box 127, 

Auckland, C. I., New Zealand. 

• Prejudice does exist all over. 

It exists in many countries, includ- 
ing some wihich ^ not i>ermit mem- 
bers of “colored” races or non- 

Christian religions to immigrate, 
rather closer to your home than the 
U. S. A., Mr. Fenn. But it is quite 
rare among science-ficion writers, 
readers — and editors! — in any 

country, — The Editor,

Dear Editor: 

I started reading Galaxy and If 
about the same time 1 began trailing 
girls home at a timorous two blocks’ 
distance. All this occurred during 
the inquistorial gloom of the early 
nineteen-fifties, when Howard Fast 
disappeared overnight from school

library shelves and you wondered if 
you’d be courtHmartialed from ROTC 
when they found your Aunt Elsa 
had chairwomaned the Spanish Re- 
publican War Relief Committee in 
Dubuque. (Even the Finnish War 
Relief Committee was suspect. One 
thing about the book- and heretic- 
buming set, their fear of the future 
is exceeded only by their ignorance 
of the past.) 

For those of us who suffered 
through the obstacle course of ado- 
lescence during that era of chrome- 
plated Stalinism, science-fiction was 
our new left, our underground, our 
movement. Perhaps we were merely 
being pragmatic. Where else but in 
a sf magazine could be we obtain 
practical information on how to, sur- 
vive in Year One after Armageddon? 
(Round up all the nubile wenches 
you could lay hands on and put 
them to studying agronomy texts 
and Alfred Eorzyhski.) Or how to 
carry on a one-man war of patriotic 
banditry against some Orwellian 
nightmare of a super-state that was 
sure to come if the Bomb didn’t. 

So thanks to Oalaxy and If, and 
best of luck in the coming yearl —

Dear Editor: 

Apparently there aren’t any ‘‘good 
newsstands” in Parkersburg — I’ve 
been looking for months now and 
still haven^t found a copy of Inters 
national Science Fiction. Are you 
sure it’s newsstand only? I’d be 
more than happy to have an Issue of 
If or Galaxy taken off my subscrip- 
tion and be sent a copy of Intemor 
tional instead. It may be the only 
way I’ll ever get a copy. 

“He That Moves” was a fine story. 


but not nearly long enough to satis- 
fy my hunger for Zelazny stories. 
More, please. ^Another istory like 
<<This Mortal Mountain” and “I’ll 
subscribe for 'life. I’d like to see 
Harlan Ellison in your pages more 
often. And how about coaxing Theo- 
dore Sturgeon back into Iff 

When are we going to get Rogue 
Star? You’ve been promising it to 
us ever since the November, 1965, 
issue. The other serials have been 
fine, but I’m igetting tired of wait- 
ing. 

So you want a more active letter 
column, eh? And the readers should 
do their , share, eh? All right, but 
we can’t do it all, you know. You’ll 
have to help us out, >and there are 
two ways you can do it. 

First, speed things up. I’ve had 
two letters printed in If so far, and 
neither has seen print less than five 
or isix months after 1 wrote it. I 
realize yon work several issues 
ahead, but surely you can do some- 
thing to get letters into print faster. 

Second, comment on the letters. 
Agree or disagree, praise our intelli- 
gence or teU us we don’t know what 
we’re talking about, it doesn’t really 
matter as long as you say something. 

1 mean, a lot of thought went into 
my proposal in my January letter, 
and the least you could have done 
was to print a small editorial guf- 
faw to show you thought it was 
funny. Discussions have to have 
two sides. 

But don’t let any of the above 
make you think 1 don’t like If. Quite 
the contrary. I’d just like to see a 
livelier “Hue and Cry.” — John P. 
Borger, Route #4, Box 66, Parkers- 
burg, West Virginia 26101.

Forgotten road to success m writing 


By J. D. Ratcliff 

I can’t imagine why more heginners don’t 
take the short road to publication — by 
writing magazine and newspaper articles. 

I’ve made a good living for 25 years 
writing articles, and I’ve enjoyed every 
minute of it. I’ve interviewed Nobel Prize 
winners and heads of state. I’ve covered 
stories from Basel to Bangkok to Buffalo. 

It’s a great life. No commuter trains to 
catch, no office routine. Whether I’m at 
home or abroad on assignment, I write 
from eight to noon every day — no more, 
no less. My afternoons are my own. 

The market for articles is vast and hun- 
gry. Over 350,000 were sold last year to 
magazines alone. Editors want pieces on 
almost any subject that comes natural to 
you -- but they demand that your writing 
be sound and professional. 

To teach professional writing techniques 
to serious beginners, I joined with Rod 
Serling, Faith Baldwin, Bennett Cerf, and 
eight other leading authors to start the 
Famous Writers School. 

We poured everything we know about 
successful writing into a new kind of 
course which trains you at home, in spare 
time. You begin with the fundamentals of 
all good writing. Then, you specialize in 
articles and other non-fiction. (Or in Fic- 
tion, Advertising or Business Writing.) 

You learn to write hy writing. Our in- 
structors, themselves all published au- 
thors, work with you by mail much as 
editors do with established writers. 

Our School is young. Yet students, many 
still in training, have broken into print in 
more than 100 publications. Several sold 
pieces they wrote as School assignments. 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you too can be a published 
writer, send for the School’s revealing Apti- 
tude Test. If you test well — or offer other 
evidence of writing ability — you may enroll. 
However, there is no obligation to do so,- 



“Jack” Ratcliff is one of America’s highest paid 
free-lance writers. Although he works only 
four hours a day, he has had hundreds of articles 
published in top magazines, including over 
100 in Reader’s Digest alone.
