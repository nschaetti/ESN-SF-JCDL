THAT 

NOTEBOOK AGAIN 



C onstant readers — the majority, 
of course — will recall the ar- 
ticle I wrote last year (the Great 
Man got thumped for some of it 
from those who thought he wrote it, 
though there was no intent to de- 
ceive) about my notebook. Just ran- 
dom jottings which I thought might 
be of interest to you. 

There’s one category of notes in 
the book which I didn’t mention, be- 
cause of a childish idea that some 
day I’m going to fabricate some of 
these things and make a fortune and 
never write editorials any more. But 
the heck with it. One, you might en- 
joy them. Two, there’s a crying need 



for some of ’em. Three, I am sur- 
rounded by unfinished projects and 
it’s past time I cleared the thicket. 

• The world is full of dark cor- 
ners which could stand a spot of 
light, yet you can’t — I can’t, any- 
way — buy a pinup lamp designed to 
fit into a corner. Not only does ev- 
ery house, bar darn few, need a 
couple of these, it’s the only way you 
can place a pinup lamp without the 
wire hanging out like a ruptured gut. 

• Compared with TV, home mov- 
ies never got off the ground. Yet 
there are obvious advantages: you 



5 





can see what you want to see when 
you want to see it; you can make 
your own films and show them. Why 
is no one making a serious effort 
to combine these devices, now that 
two-thirds of the population spends 
more time staring at the box than 
it does at school or making a living? 
Going at it whole hog, a hand-held 
TV tape camera would make a reel 
which could be dropped directly into 
the TV set without developing. Or 
— I should say and/or — a hybrid de- 
vice could scan rented or owned 
movie film, perhaps with a bank of 
photocells, and activate the picture 
tube. I refuse to believe this is a 
particularly large technical problem. 

• Area measuring device. Put a 
map under known illumination and 
get a reading from a light meter 
at a fixed distance. Ink in the area 
to be measured with black ink and 
take another reading. If the original 
area is known, the second reading 
will give you an exact ratio. 

• Mars canal photos. The “twin- 
kle” effect is supposed to obscure 
them to some viewers, reveal them 
to others. So take your photos with 
high-sensitivity movie film, by the 
thousand-foot shot (granting good 
’scope of course.) Then sit and 
watch the film. If the “twinkle” the- 
ory is correct, surely you’ll get one 
or two frames with canals showing. 

• Household wiring, especially 
surface wiring, ready primed so it 



will take oil-based or alkyd paints. 

• A mechanical self-starter. Now 
that lawn-mowers and outboards 
come with the so-called “impulse” 
starter, which is nothing more than 
king-sized clockwork, why hasn’t 
someone thought of the same thing 
for cars? The spring could be wound 
by the engine when it was running; 
it could be a heck of a big one, and 
it need not necessarily be wound 
too fast. Once wound, a'ratchet would 
hold it that way until it was called 
on. (Only for Pete’s sakes keep your 
plugs clean!) 

• Why — why has no enterprising 
firm or person put the simple fact 
of rising joblessness against the sim- 
ple fact of the shortage in good 
household servants, and come up 
with the simple answer of a train- 
ing/hiring agency for competent 
household help? There are still, be- 
lieve it or not, lots of people who 
can afford servants and claim they 
can’t find them. Not good ones, any- 
way. There have been times and 
places when household service was 
a dignified, honorable and — heaven 
knows — skilled occupation. It could 
be again, and if it caught on as a 
keep-up-with-the-Jones thing, some- 
body would stand to make a classic 
buck. 

The thicket’s still thick. Let’s see 
if my ideas can make money. Then 
the next step is to see if they can 
make money for me!

IF 




SPACE 



Every man, every living thing In the 
world was joined In the great Plan of 
Man — the Plan that had redoubled Its 
efforts because it had lost its goal! 




I 

nphe major snapped: “Check in, 
A you Risks! What’s the matter 
with you?” His radar horns made 
him look like Satan — a sleepy 
young Satan with an underslung 
jaw, but dangerous. 

“Yes, sir,” said Steve Ryeland, 
peering around. This was Reykjavik 
— a new world to Ryeland, who 
had just come from a maximum- 
security labor camp inside the rim 
of the Arctic Circle. Ryeland blinked 
at the buildings, a thousand feet 
high, and at the jets and rockets 
scattered across the air field. The 
little man next to Ryeland sneezed 
and nudged him. “All right,” Rye- 
land said, and went into the bare 
little Security lounge. On the tele- 
type that stood in the corner of the 
room — in the corner of every 
room — he tapped out: 

Information. Steven Ryeland, 
Risk, AWC-38440, and 0. B. 
Oporto, Risk, XYZ-99942, ar- 
rived at — 

He took the code letters from 



THE REEFS OF SPACE

the identification plate on the ma- 
chine. 

— Station 3-Radius 4-261, 
Reykjavik, Iceland. Query. What 
are personal ordeis? 

In a moment the answer came 
from the Planning Machine, a single 
typed letter “R”. The Machine had 
received and understood the mes- 
sage and adjusted its records. The 
orders would follow. 

A Togetherness girl glanced into 
the lounge, saw the collars on Rye- 
land and the little man. Her lips 
had started to curve in the smile of 
her trade, but they clamped into a 
thin line. Risks. She nodded to the 
major and turned away. 

The teletype bell rang, and the 
Machine tapped out: 

Action. Proceed to Train 667, 
Track 6, Compartment 93. 

Ryeland acknowledged the mes- 
sage. The major, leaning over his 
shoulder, grinned. “A one-way ticket 
to the Body Bank if you want my 
guess.” 

“Yes, sir.” Ryeland was not going 
to get into a discussion. He couldn’t 
win. No Risk could win an argu- 
ment with a man who wore the 
major’s radar horns. 

“Well,* get going,” the major grum- 
bled. “Oh, and Ryeland — ” 

“Yes, sir?” 

The major winked. “Thanks for 
the chess games. I’ll be seeing you, 
I guess. Parts of you!” He laughed 
raucously as he strode away. “No 
side trips, remember,” he warned. 



“I’ll remember,” said Steve Rye- 
land softly, touching the collar he 
wore. 

Oporto sneezed again. “Come on,” 
he grumbled. 

“All right. What was that num- 
ber?” 

The little dark man grinned. 
“Train 667, Track 6, Compartment 
93. That’s an easy one — ah choo! 
Dabbit,” he complained, “I’m catch- 
ing cold. Let’s get out of this draft.” 

Ryeland led off. They walked un- 
escorted across the pavement to a 
cab rank and got in. All around 
them, travelers, air field workers 
and others glanced at them, saw the 
iron collars — and at once, on each 
face a curtain descended. No one 
spoke to them. Ryeland punched 
the code numbers for their destina- 
tion, and the car raced through 
broad boulevards to a huge marble 
structure on the other side of the 
city. 

Over its wide entrance were the 
carved letters: 

THE PLAN OF MAN 
SUBTRAIN STATION 

T hey made their way through 
a wide concourse, noisy and 
crowded; but everyone gave them 
plenty of room. Ryeland grinned 
sourly to himself. No side trips! Of 
course not — and for the same rea- 
son. It wasn’t healthy for a man who 
wore the collar to step out of line. 
And it wasn’t healthy for anyone 
else to be in his immediate neigh- 
borhood if he did. 

“Track Six, was it?” 

“Train 667, Compartment 93. 

IF 



10 




Can’t you remember anything?” 
Oporto demanded. 

“There’s Track Six.” Ryeland led 
the way. Track Six was a freight 
platform. They went down a flight 
of motionless moving stairs and 
emerged beside the cradle track of 
the subtrains. 

Since the subtrains spanned the 
world, there was no clue as to where 
they were going. From Iceland they 
could be going to Canada, to Brazil, 
even to South Africa; the monstrous 
atomic drills of the Plan had bur- 
rowed perfectly straight shafts from 
everywhere to everywhere. The sub- 
trains rocketed through air-exhaust- 
ed tunnels, swung between hoops of 
electrostatic force. Without friction, 
their speed compared with the ve- 
locity of interplanetary travel. 

“Where is it?” Oporto grumbled, 
looking around. A harsh light flood- 
ed the grimy platforms, glittering 
on the huge aluminum balloons that 
lay in their cradles outside the vac- 
uum locks. Men with trucks and 
cranes were loading a long row of 
freightspheres in the platform next 
to theirs; a little cluster of passen- 
gers began to appear down the mov- 
ing stairs of a platform a hundred 
yards away. Oporto said abruptly: 
“I’ll give you six to five the next 
train in is ours.” 

“No bet.” Ryeland knew better 
than to take him up. But he hoped 
the little man was right. It was cold 
on the platform. Chill air roared 
around them from the ventilators; 
Oporto, already chilled, sneezed and 
began to sniffle. Ryeland himself 
was shivering in his thin maximum- 
security denims. 

THE REEFS OF SPACE 



At the camp, when their travel 
orders came through, regulations de- 
manded a thorough medical exami- 
nation before they left. That was the 
rule under the Plan, and the exami- 
nation included a steaming shower. 
“They want nice clean meat at the 
Body Bank,” the guard .guffawed; 
but Ryeland paid no attention. He 
couldn’t afford to. 

A man who wore the iron collar 
around his neck could only afford 
a limited look into the future. He 
could think about the day when the 
collar came off, and nothing else. 

A warning horn shrieked into the 
pit. Ryeland jumped; Oporto turned 
more slowly, as though he had been 
expecting it. Which he had. 

Red signals flickered from the 
enormous gates of the vacuum lock 
on Track Six. Air valves gasped. 
The gates swung slowly open and a 
tractor emerged towing a cradle 
with the special car they were wait- 
ing for. “You would have lost,” 
Oporto commented and Ryeland 
nodded; of course he would have. 

The car stopped. Equalizer valves 
snorted again, and then its tall door 
flopped out from the top, forming 
a ramp to the platform. Escalators 
began to crawl along it. 

Oporto said anxiously: “Steve, I 
don’t like the looks of this!” Out of 
the opening door of the car two 
men in uniform came running. They 
ran up the escalators, raced onto 
the platform and up the stairs. They 
didn't look at Ryeland or Oporto; 
they were in a hurry. They were 
bearing thick leather dispatch cases 
the same color as their uniforms. 

Bright blue uniforms! 



11 




Why, that was the uniform of the 
special guard of — 

Ryeland lifted his eyes to look, 
unbelieving. At the roof of the shed, 
amid the ugly web of ducts and 
pipes and cables, a brilliant light 
burst forth, shining down on the 
sphere. And across its top, forty 
feet above the platform, there was 
a gleaming blue star and under it, 
etched in crystalline white, the 
legend: 

THE PLAN OF MAN 
OFFICE OF THE PLANNER 

The special car they had been 
waiting for was the private car of 
the Planner himselfl 

T he first thought that crossed 
Steve Ryeland's mind was: 
Now I can present my case to the 
Planner! But the second thought 
canceled it. The Planner, like every 
other human on Earth or the plan- 
ets, was only an instrument of the 
Planning Machine. If clearance ever 
came to Ryeland — if the collar 
came off his neck — it would be be- 
cause the Machine had considered 
all the evidence and reached a prop- 
er decision. Human argument would 
not affect it. 

With an effort, Ryeland put the 
thought out of his mind; but all the 
same, he couldn’t help feeling a 
touch better, a degree stronger. At 
least it was almost certain that their 
destination would not be the Body 
Bank! 

“What was that compartment 
number?” 

Oporto sighed. “93. Can’t you re- 



member anything? Train 667 — the 
product of the two primes, 23 and 
29. Track 6, their difference. Com- 
partment 93, their last digits in re- 
verse order. That’s an easy one — ” 
But Ryeland was hardly listening. 
The intimate acquaintance that Op- 
orto seemed to have with all num- 
bers was no longer news to him, 
and he had more urgent things on 
his mind. He led the way up the 
ramp and into the Planner’s sub- 
train car. A woman in the blue uni- 
form of the guard passed them, 
glanced at their collars and frown- 
ed. Before Ryeland could speak to 
her she had brushed past them bus- 
ily and was gone. It said a lot for 
the efficiency of the collars, he 
thought wryly, that she didn’t both- 
er to find out what two Risks were 
doing wandering freely around the 
Planner’s private car. There was no 
cause for worry; if they took a 
wrong turning, the collars would 
make it their last. 

But by the same token, it was 
highly dangerous for them to wan- 
der around. Ryeland stopped short 
and waited until someone else came 
by. “Sir!” he called. “Excuse me!” 
It was a straight, gray-haired 
man in the blue of the Planner’s 
guard, wearing the silver mushrooms 
of a Technicorps colonel. “What is 
it?” he demanded impatiently. 

“We’re ordered to compartment 
93,” Ryeland explained. 

The colonel looked at him 
thoughtfully. “Name,” he snapped. 
“Ryeland, Steven. And Oporto.” 
“Umm.” Presently the colonel 
sighed. “All right,” he said grouchily. 
“Can’t have you messing up the 

IF 



12 




Planner’s car with your blood. Better 
get secured. This way.” He led them 
to a tiny room, ushered them in. 
“Look,” he said, flexing the knob of 
the door. “No lock. But I should 
warn you that most of the corridors 
are radar-trapped. Do you under- 
stand?” They understood. “All 
right.” 

He hesitated. “By the way. My 
name’s Lescure, Colonel Pascal Les- 
cure. We’ll meet again.” And he 
closed the door behind him. 

R yeland looked quickly around 
the room, but it wasn’t the 
splendor of its furnishings or the 
comfort of its appointments that in- 
terested him. It was the teletype. 
Quickly he reported in for himself 
and Oporto. 

The answer came: 

R. Action. Await further or- 
ders. 

Oporto was beginning to look 
flushed and to tremble. “Always it’s 
lige this,” he said thickly. “I ged a 
cold and if I don’t tage care I’m 
sick for weegs. I’m feeling lighd- 
headed already!” He stood up, tot- 
tering. , 

Ryeland shook his head. “No, 
you’re not lightheaded. We’re mov- 
ing.” The hand at the controls of 
the subtrain knew whose private 
car he was driving down the elec- 
trostatic tubes. The giant sphere was 
being given a featherbed ride. They 
had felt no jar at all on starting, but 
now they began to feel curiously 
light. 

That was intrinsic to the way of 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



travel. The subtrain waj arrowing 
along a chord from point to point; 
on long hauls the tunnels dipped 
nearly a thousand miles below the 
earth’s surface at the halfway mark. 
Once the initial acceleration was 
over, the first half of a trip by sub- 
train was like dropping in a super- 
speed express elevator. 

Absently Ryeland reached out an 
arm to brace Oporto as the little 
man weaved and shuddered. He 
frowned. The helical fields which 
walled the tunnels of the subtrains 
owed part of their stability to him- 
self. On that Friday night, three 
years before, when the Plan Police 
burst in upon him, he had just fin- 
ished dictating the specifications for 
a new helical unit that halved hys- 
teresis losses, had a service life at 
least double the old ones. 

And yet he could only remember 
that much and no more. 

Had something been done to his 
mind? For the thousandth time Rye- 
land asked himself that question. He 
could remember the equations of his 
helical field theory that transformed 
the crude “magnetic bottles” that 
had first walled out the fluid rock, 
as early nucleonicists had walled in 
the plasma of fusing hydrogen. Yet 
he could not remember the work 
that had led him to its design. He 
could remember his design for ion 
accelerators to wall the atomic rock- 
ets of spaceships, and yet the author 
of that design — himself — was a 
stranger. What sort of man had he 
been? What had he done? 

“Sdeve,” Oporto moaned. “You 
wouldn’t have a drink on you?” 

Ryeland turned, brought back to 

13 




reality. A drink! Oporto was fever- 
ish. “I’d better call the machine,” he 
said. 

Oporto nodded weakly. “Yes, call 
in. I’m sick, Sdeve.” 

Ryeland hesitated. The little man 
did look sick. While he was standing 
there, Oporto blundered past him. 
“I’ll do id myself,” he grumbled. 
“Ged out of my way.” 

He reached with fumbling fingers 
for the keyboard, his face turned 
angrily toward Ryeland. That was a 
mistake; he should have been watch- 
ing. In the unsteady footing he 
lurched, reached for the keyboard, 
missed, stumbled and fell heavily 
against the teletype. 

It toppled with a crash. There was 
a quick white flash from inside it 
and a sudden pungent smell of burn- 
ing. 

Oporto got slowly to his feet. 

Ryeland opened his mouth and 
then closed it without saying any- 
thing. What was the use? Obviously 
the teletype was out of commission; 
obviously Oporto hadn’t done it on 
purpose. 

Oporto groaned: “Oh, dabbit. 

Steve, where’d thad colonel go? 
Maybe he could ged me some- 
thing ...” 

“Take it easy,” Ryeland said ab- 
sently. The little man’s condition 
was clearly* not good but, in truth, 
it was not Oporto that was on Rye- 
land's mind just then. It was the 
teletype. 

Always, since the first days after 
school, there had been no move 
Steve Ryeland made, no action he 
performed, without checking in with 
the Machine. Even at the maximum- 



security camp there had been a tele- 
type on direct linkage with the Ma- 
chine, standing in one desolate cor- 
ner of the bare barracks. 

He felt curiously naked, and 
somehow forlorn. 

“Steve,” said Oporto faintly, 
“could you ged me a glass of water?” 

That at least was possible; there 
was a silver carafe and crystal tum- 
blers, fired with gold designs. Rye- 
land poured the little man a glass 
and handed it to him. Oporto took 
it and sank back against a huge, 
richly upholstered chair, his eyes 
closed. 

Ryeland roamed around the 
little cubicle. There wasn’t much 
else for him to do. The colonel had 
warned them against radar-traps in 
the corridors; it was not to be 
thought of that they would go out 
and take the chance of being de- 
stroyed by a single wrong move. 

For they were Risks; and the iron 
collars they wore contained eighty 
grams of a high explosive. A step 
into an area proscribed for Risks 
(and such areas were common all 
over the world) meant that a trig- 
gering radar beam would touch off 
the explosive. Ryeland had seen that 
happen once. He didn’t want it to 
happen to him. 

B rig or no brig, this room was 
part of the Planner’s private 
car and it was furnished in a way 
that Ryeland had not seen in three 
years. He fingered the drapes around 
a mock-window and reached out to 
touch the polished mirror of a hard- 
wood table top. 

Three years ago Ryeland had 

IF 



14 




lived in a room something like this. 
No, he admitted, not quite as lavish. 
But a room that belonged to him, 
with furniture that no one else used 
and a place for his clothes, his books, 
the things he kept around him. But 
in that life he had been a cleared 
man, with a place in the Plan of 
Man and a quota to be met. That 
life had ended three years ago, on 
that fatal Friday afternoon. 

Even now, after endless sessions 
of what was called reconstructive 
therapy, Ryeland couldn’t under- 
stand what had happened to him. 
The vaguely worded charge was “un- 
planned thinking,” but all his merci- 
less therapists had failed to help 
him recall any thoughts disloyal to 
the machine. The only material evi- 
dence of unplanned activities was 
his collection of space literature — 
the yellowed old copies of books by 
Ley and Gamow and Hoyle and 
Einstein that he had saved from his 
father’s library. 

Of course he knew that the books 
were not on the list approved by 
the Plan, but he had intended no 
disloyalty with his hobby. In fact, as 
he had many times told the thera- 
pists, the special equations of the 
helical field were related to the 
mathematics of the whole universe. 
Without knowing the equations for 
the expansion of the universe and 
the continuous creation of matter 
in the space between the galaxies, 
he could not have improved the heli- 
cal units for the subtrain tunnels. 

But the therapists had always re- 
fused to specify exact charges. Men 
under the Plan no longer had rights, 
but merely functions. The purpose 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



of the therapists was not to supply 
him with information. But to extract 
information from him. The sessions 
had failed, because he couldn’t re- 
member whatever it was that the 
therapists had been attempting to 
extract. 

There was so much hat he could 
not remember. 

Oporto said weakly: “Sdeve, ged 
me a doctor.” 

“I can’t!” Ryeland said bitterly: 
“If the Plan wants you sick you’ll 
have to be sick.” 

Oporto’s face % turned a shade 
paler. “Shut up! Somebody may be 
listening.” 

“I’m not criticizing the Plan. But 
we have to stay here, you know 
that.” 

“Ryeland,” Oporto begged, and 
went into a coughing fit. 

Ryeland looked down at the lit- 
tle man. He seemed to be in serious 
trouble now. Evidently his system 
was an ultra-allergic type. Swept 
clean of disease organisms in the 
sterile air that blew down on the 
isolation camp from the Pole, he 
had been ripe for infection. He was 
breathing heavily and raggedly, and 
heat wafted off his forehead as Rye- 
land brought his hand near it. 

“Hold on, Oporto,” he said. “It’ll 
only be a little while. Maybe a 
couple of hours.” At a thousand 
miles an hour, there was no place 
on Earth much farther away than 
that. 

“I can be dead in a couble of 
hours,” said Oporto. “Can’t you ged 
me a doctor?” 

Ryeland hesitated. There was 
truth to what the little man said. 

15 




The Plan provided constant immun- 
ization for those who lived in areas 
exposed to disease; but the hypo- 
allergic, like Oporto, might well 
lose that immunity in a few months. 
And Oporto had been breathing 
sterile air for three years. 

“All right,” said Ryeland wear- 
ily, “I’ll do what I can. You come 
with me, Oporto.” Booby-trapped 
the halls might be, dangerous the 
trip certainly was; but it was life 
and death to Oporto. 

he door opened easily. 

Ryeland, half supporting Opor- 
to, looked out into the corridor. No 
one was in sight. He sighed; he had 
hoped that they might find a pass- 
erby. Oporto babbled: “Steve, what 
are you doing? Led me alone. We 
can’t go oud here — the colonel 
warned us!” 

“We have to get you to a doctor, 
remember?” Ryeland scanned the 
corridor. At the intersections were 
curious canopied devices like the 
sun-shelter over a mogul’s howdah. 
Perhaps they were the radar traps; 
at least, Ryeland couldn’t imagine 
what else they might be. But there 
was one back the way they had 
come, and surely there had been no 
trap there 

No. Ryeland thought it out care- 
fully. The fact that they had been 
allowed to get to Compartment 93 
didn’t prove anything at all; quite 
possibly the traps had been turned 
off to allow them to pass. In fact, 
thinking it over, it seemed certain 
that the one route that would be 
prohibited would be the corridor go- 
ing back to the entrance port. 

16 



“Oporto,” he said, “do you see 
those doors? I think we can go into 
one of them.” 

“You do, Steve? What mages you 
think so?” the little man asked sar- 
donically. 

“Because there’s nothing better to 
try,” Ryeland snapped, and dragged 
the little man with him. 

Around his neck the iron collar 
weighed heavier than ever. If only 
he were a superman, like that Don- 
derevo whose name stuck half-for- 
gotten in his mind . whose fate, 
somehow, was linked with Ryeland’s 
own. 

Who was Donderevo, exactly? 
The therapists had questioned him 
so persistently about the man that 
there had to be some strong reason. 
Did Ryeland know him? When had 
he last seen him? When had he re- 
ceived a message from him? What 
was the message about? 

Donderevo was the son of an ex- 
plorer and trader who had gathered 
a fortune from the asteroids and 
the moons of the outer planets, and 
had built a commercial empire out- 
side the Plan of Man. Ron Don- 
derevo had come to Earth as a stu- 
dent of space medicine at the great 
technological institute where Rye- 
land’s father was a mathematics 
professor. While he was there, the 
Plan had annexed the last reluctant 
asteroids and moons which had re- 
mained outside. Donderevo’s father 
had been defeated in a space fight, 
resisting the annexation. Donderevo 
himself had been placed in an iron 
collar, as a result of a student dem- 
onstration. Then one day he had 
disappeared. The legends said that 

IP 





he had somehow removed the col- 
lar, and escaped into space beyond 
the power of the Plan. 

Ryeland remembered meeting 
him only once, in his own father’s 
study. Ryeland was an eight-year- 
old Technicub. Donderevo was a 
grown man, a graduate student, 
romantic and mysterious with his 
knowledge of far planets and un- 
known space. But was that enough 
to account for the questions? 

Ryeland had denied receiving any 
message from him, but the thera- 
pists were unconvinced. 

In any event, whatever Dondere- 
vo might have been, Ryeland wasn’t; 
his collar was on for good, or until 
the Machine relented. 

Ryeland wondered crazily if he 
would hear the tiny click of the re- 
lay before the decapitation charge 
went off. Would there be any warn- 
ing? Would he know? 

Or would it all be over, literally, 
before he knew what was happen- 
ing? 

The only way to find out was to 
open a door and walk through it. 

He pushed a door open, selecting 
it at random from the half-dozen in 
the corridor. Oporto broke away 
from hifn and, surprisingly spry, ran 
a few paces down the corridor, 
whirled and watched him with a 
face of tense anticipation. 

Ryeland didn’t stop to think it 
over, he walked in the door; and 
nothing happened. 

Grinning, embarrassed, Oporto 
trailed after. “That one was all 
right, huh, Steve?” 

Ryeland nodded; but there was 
no point in recrimination, although 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 




there were a lot of things he had in 
mind to say to the man who had 
urged him to take a chance — and 
then ducked out of the way of the 
possible consequences. But of more 
immediate interest was the room 
they were in. 

It was about the size of Compart- 
ment 93 and empty. It was quietly 
furnished: A narrow bed, a table 
with a few flowers, a large mirror, 
an array of cabinets. A girl’s room, 
Ryeland guessed, but from the rel- 
ative modesty of its furnishings, 
not the room of a girl who was part 
of the higher brass on this de luxe 
subtrain. Possibly a secretary’s 
room; perhaps a maid’s. Whoever 
she was, she wasn't in. 

But there was another door, lead- 
ing to a flight of steps. 

This time Ryeland didn’t wait for 
Oporto. He caught his breath and 
held it, and when he had passed 

17 



through and established once again 
that that particular door was not 
radar-trapped, he tasted salt and 
acid on his lip. He had bitten hard 
enough to draw blood. 

But he was through. 

The stairs were steep, but it was 
easy enough to help Oporto up them, 
with the plunging of the car taking 
pounds off their weight. They came 
out into another room, also empty 
and small. 

But this one was sumptuously 
furnished. It seemed to be a wom- 
an’s dressing room. It was white 
and gold, with ivory-backed brushes 
and combs on a little vanity table, 
before a gold-rimmed oval mirror. 
The stairs, Ryeland guessed, were 
for the use of the personal maid to 
whoever used this room. 

And he heard someone singing. 

R yeland took a deep breath 
and called out: “Hello there! 
Do you hear me? I’m looking for 
a doctor!” 

There wasn’t any answer. The 
singing went on, a girl’s voice, clear 
and attractive; she was singing for 
her own amusement. Every once in 
a while she would go back and re- 
peat a phrase, pause, then start 
again aimlessly. And under the sing- 
ing was' a sort of musical cooing 
accompaniment. 

Ryeland looked at Oporto, 
shrugged and pushed the door open. 

They looked into a room that was 
green and silver. Its walls swam 
with fading, shifting green light. In 
the center was a round silver tub, 
six feet across, partly recessed into 
the floor. From the mouths of 
18 



carved crystal dolphins tiny jets of 
perfumed warm water leaped and 
splashed, in a foam of bubbles, in- 
to the tub. 

And above the thick blanket of 
foam protruded one knee, the head 
and the arms of the most beautiful 
girl Ryeland had ever seen. 

“I — I beg your pardon,” he 
said, awkward and disturbed. 

She turned her head and looked 
at him calmly. On her wet, white 
shoulders were perched a pair of — 
birds? No. They were shaped like 
birds, like doves, but they were 
made of metal; their feathers were 
fine silver scales; their eyes were 
red-lit jewels. The metal things 
moved restlessly, as the little eyes 
poked hotly at Ryeland and Oporto. 
They cooed soft threats, and the 
rustle of their wings was like thin 
whispering bells. 

Oporto opened his eyes, stared 
and emitted a strangling sound. 
“She — She — ” He swallowed and 
clutched at Ryeland. “Steve, it’s the 
Planner’s daughter!” he gasped, and 
flung himself to the floor. “Please!” 
he begged, writhing toward her. 
“Please, we didn’t mean to bother 
you!” 

But the approach must have 
alarmed her. Not very much; for 
she didn’t raise her voice; but she 
stopped singing in the middle of a 
note and said, quite softly: “Guards.” 

There must have been a micro- 
phone to pick up her words, for 
there was a sudden commotion out- 
side. But more than that, she had 
defenders nearer still. The doves on 
her shoulders leaped into the air 
and flung themselves at the prostrate 

IF 




little man. Sharp beaks tore, wing- 
tips like knives beat at him. The 
door opened and four tall women 
in the blue of the Planner’s guard 
raced in. 

n 

D eath had not been far from 
Steve Ryeland for these three 
years. It had worn the neat white 
smock of Dr. Thrale, the fat, bald, 
oily man who had been his chief 
therapist. It had whispered in the 
soft, asthmatic voice of Dr. Thrale, 
warning him a thousand times that 
he stood in danger of the Body 
Bank, unless he could recall a mes- 
sage from Ron Donderevo, unless 
he could find the right answers to 
nonsense questions about a string 
of words and names that meant 
nothing to him — spaceling, reefs 
of space , Donderevo, jetless drive. 

Death had taken other forms. 
The concealed trigger of a radar 
trap, the menacing horns of a radar- 
headset, the more subtle and more 
worrisome peril of orders to the 
Body Bank; these were the deaths 
he had known and learned to live 
with. These women, though, carried 
projectile weapons, not radar. 
Queer, thought Ryeland, even in 
that moment, for if carried through 
the thought indicated that there 
were some dangers to the person of 
the Planner’s daughter that did not 
come from classified Risks like him- 
self. Could ordinary citizens — 
cleared citizens — be dangerous to 
the Plan? 

But there was no answer to that 
question just then. Oporto was 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



screaming under the attack of the 
silvery doves, the woman guards 
were bearing down on them. 

The girl stopped them all with a 
single word. “Wait.” She swept a 
mound of bubbles away from her 
face to see better, exposing a throat 
of alabaster. Her eyes were green- 
gray and serene. She looked very 
lovely and very young. 

She caught Ryeland completely 
undefended. 

In the isolation camp there had 
been no women — not even a pin- 
up picture; and here he was in the 
presence of a most beautiful wom- 
an, in what should have been the 
privacy of her bath. Apart from 
everything else, she could hardly 
have been unaware of the shatter- 
ing effect she had on him. But she 
seemed completely at ease. She 
said, in a voice more polite than 
curious: “What do you want?” 
Ryeland coughed. “This man 
needs a doctor,” he said hoarsely, 
looking away. 

The first of the female guards 
laughed sharply. She was tall, bru- 
nette; a heroic figure of what might 
have been a lovely girl, if reduced 
ten per cent in all dimensions. She 
said in a voice that just missed being 
baritone: “Come on, Risk! We’ll take 
care of you and your friend too!” 
But the girl in the tub shifted 
position lazily. She waved an arm 
through the foam, watched the bub- 
bles billow in slow concentric waves 
and said: “Never mind, Sergeant. 
Take the sick man to a doctor, if 
that’s what he wants. Leave the 
other one here.” 

“But, Madam! The Planner — ” 

19 




“Sergeant,” said the gentle voice, 
not raised at all; the sergeant turned 
almost white. She gestured at the 
others; they half carried Oporto out. 
The door closed behind them, cut- 
ting in twain a look of pure hatred 
and contempt that passed from the 
sergeant to Ryeland. 

The doves, which had been de- 
scribing precise circles in the air, 
shook themselves and returned to 
the girl’s shoulders. Their hot small 
eyes never left Ryeland, but after 
a moment they began to coo again. 

“You’re an iron-collar man, aren’t 
you?” the girl asked suddenly. 
Ryeland nodded. “A risk. Yes.” 
“I’ve never spoken to an iron- 
collar man ” she said thoughtfully. 
“Do you mind if we talk? I’m Donna 
Creery. My father is the Planner.” 
“I know.” Suddenly Ryeland was 
aware of his rumpled denims, of the 
fact that he was an intruder on this 
girl’s bath. He coughed. “Don’t you 
think your father — T mean, I 
don’t mind if we talk, but — ” 
“Good,” said the girl, nodding 
gravely. She shifted position to get 
a better look at him. The bubbles 
rippled wildly. “I was afraid you 
might be sensitive about it,” she told 
him. “I’m glad you’re not. What’s 
your name?” 

Ryeland raised his chin and 
spread the dollar of his denim shirt 
to display the iron band. 

“Sfeven Ryeland,” she read, squint- 
ing to make out the glowing scarlet 
letters with his name and number. 
“Why, I think I know that name. A 
doctor? No. A rocket pilot?” 

“I am a mathematician, Miss 
Creery.” 

20 



She cried: “Oh, of course! Your 
folder is on my father’s desk. I saw 
it this morning, when we were leav- 
ing Copenhagen.” 

A n anxious eagerness took his 
breath. For three years he had 
been trying to learn the charges 
against him. The therapists had re- 
fused to give him information. Their 
questions had been carefully phrased 
to tell him nothing — they had 
asked him a thousand times what 
the word spaceling meant, and pun- 
ished him more then once for guess- 
ing that it meant an inhabitant of 
space. 

“Did the folder tell — ” He gulped. 
“Did it specify any charges against 
me?” 

Her greenish eyes surveyed him, 
unalarmed. 

“You displayed unplanned inter- 
ests.” 

“Huh? What does that mean?” 
“You possessed a secret collection 
of books and manuscripts, which 
had not been approved by the ma- 
chine.” 

“No, I didn’t!” A cold breath 
touched the back of his neck. “There 
has been some terrible mistake — ” 
“The Planning Machine permits 
no mistakes,” she reminded him 
gravely. “The titles of the forbidden 
books were listed in the folder. The 
authors were scientists of the wicked 
times before the Plan. Einstein. 
Gamow. Hoyle — ” 

“Oh!” He gasped. “Then those 
were just my father’s books — a 
few that I saved. You see, when I 
was a kid I used to dream of going 
to space. I’ve met Ron Donderevo. I 

IF 




wanted to pilot a spaceship, and 
discover new planets. The Machine 
killed that dream.” 

He sighed. 

“It transferred me out of the 
Technicorps and reclassified me as 
a research mathematician. It assign- 
ed me to an installation somewhere 
underground — I don’t know where 
it was; we were not allowed even 
to guess whether we were under dry 
land or the ocean floor or the polar 
ice. I don’t remember, even, if I 
ever guessed. My memory has . 
holes in it. I had two helpers — a 
teletype girl and a little man named 
Oporto, who is a sort of human 
computing machine. The Machine 
sent us problems, like the problem 
of hysterisis loss in the subtrain tun- 
nels. They were problems the Ma- 
chine couldn’t answer, I suppose — 
even it doesn’t know quite every- 
thing. Anyhow, we solved the prob- 
lems. 

“Of course I wasn't supposed to 
need reference books, because I 
could ask the Machine for any fact 
I wanted. But for the sake of effi- 
ciency it had let me keep a few 
handbooks, and I had brought those 
books of my father’s among them.” 

He smiled .at her hopefully. 

“You see, for a man who had set 
his heart on space, life in a tunnel 
isn’t very exciting. For a sort of 
hobby, I read those books about 
space. They were full of old theories 
about the nature of the universe. 
Using modern mathematics, I work- 
ed out a new set of equations to 
describe the expanding universe and 
the continuous creation of matter 
in the space between the galaxies — ” 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



Her frown checked him. This was 
not quite the sort of talk for a 
young girl in her bath! 

“But that was not unplanned,” ha 
finished desperately. “It was just a 
harmless hobby. In fact, it was use- 
ful to the Plan. The equations that 
I used in improving the helical field 
units were derived from the equa- 
tions that describe the oontinuous 
creation of matter and space.” 

“And that’s what made you a 
risk?” She looked at him thought- 
fully and frowned. “You don’t look 
dangerous.” 

He could find no answer to that 
He waited while she waved a hand 
absent-mindedly. One of the doves 
left her shoulder to fly, tinkling, to 
the crystal dolphin. It pecked pre- 
cisely at a fin-shaped lever on the 
dolphin’s back, and obediently the 
spray of perfumed water dwindled 
away. Ryeland watched, more than 
half lulled by the scent of lilac and 
the strangeness of his surroundings. 
The room was warm but not steamy; 
invisible ducts must be sucking the 
moisture out * Are you dangerous?” 
the girl asked suddenly. 

TJ ydand said: “No, Miss Creery.” 
IV He hesitated, wondering how 
to explain it to this child. “The col- 
lar isn’t a punishment. It’s a pre- 
caution.” 

“Precaution?” 

He said steadily: “The Machine 
has reason to believe that under cer- 
tain circumstances I might work 
against the Plan of Man. I have 
never done anything, you must un- 
derstand that. But the Machine can’t 
take chances, and so — the collar.” 



21 




She said wonderingly: “But you 
sound as though you approve of it!” 
“I’m loyal to the Plan!” 

She thought that over. Then: 
“Well, aren’t we all? But the rest of 
us don’t wear iron collars.” 

He shook his head. “I never did 
anything that was against Security.” 
“But perhaps you did something 
that wasn’t — quite?” 

Ryeland grinned. She was amaz- 
ingly easy to get along with, he 
thought; the grin became a smile — 
a real one, and the first he had 
worn in some time. “Yes,” he ad- 
mitted, “I did something that wasn’t. 
There was a girl.” 

“Steven, Steven!” Donna Creery 
shook her head mock-ruefully. “Al- 
ways a girl. I thought that was only 
in stories.” 

“In real life too, Miss Creery.” He 
was almost relaxed. Then, abrupt- 
ly, her mood changed. 

“Your folder contains another 
specification,” she rapped out. “You 
are charged with concealing infor- 
mation about a device which is dan- 
gerous to the security of the Plan 
of Man.” 

“But I’m not!” he protested des- 
perately. “Somebody has made a 
mistake — in spite of the Machine. 
For three years the therapists in the 
maximum security camp have been 
working me over, trying to extract 
information that I don’t have.” 

Her eyes widened, with a calm 
concern. 

“What kind of information?” 

“I’m not sure.” He winced, with 
remembered pain. “They were care- 
ful not to give me hints, and they 
punished me for guessing. 

22 



“They questioned me about a list 
of words,” he said. “They strapped 
me down, with electrodes clamped 
all over me, recording every reaction. 
They repeated the words a million 
times. Spaceling. Reefs of space . 
Fusorian. Pyropod. Jetless drive. 
And two names — Ron Donderevo 
and Daniel Horrock. 

“Putting all those words and names 
and other clues together, I guessed 
that the therapists thought that Hor- 
rock had brought me <a message 
from Donderevo. A message 
from space, about things called reefs 
and spacelings and fusorians. Par- 
ticularly, about something called a 
jetless drive. That was what they 
were trying to dig out of me — 
how to build a jetless drive.” 

She frowned. 

“What is a jetless drive?” 

“There isn’t any,” he said. “Be- 
cause a jetless drive would be a 
system of reactionless propulsion. 
Crackpots for three hundred years 
have been trying to invent such a 
system, but everybody knows it 
would be a violation of the Third 
Law of Motion. It’s as impossible as 
pushing a rowboat forward without 
pushing the water back.” 

“I see.” She was nodding gravely. 
“Impossible as creating new atoms 
and new space between the galaxies.” 

H e looked at her sharply. 

“But I couldn't have had a 
message from Horrock — or any- 
body else,” he insisted desperately. 
“Not when they seem to think I did. 
On the Friday it happened, Oddball 
Oporto and the teletype girl had been 
with me all day. We were work- 

'F 




mg late, finishing the specifications 
for the new helical unit. I let Odd- 
ball go about eighteen hundred 
hours, because he was getting a 
headache. The teletype girl went out 
with him, to bring coffee and sand- 
wiches for us. They hadn’t been 
gone half an hour, when somebody 
knocked on the door. I thought it 
was the girl — but it was the Plan 
Police.” 

“That wasn’t on Friday.” Donna 
Creery’s eyes were veiled, strange. 
“According to the records in your 
folder, you were taken into precau- 
tionary custody at eighteen hundred 
hours on a Monday afternoon. That 
leaves at least three days missing 
from your story.” 

Ryeland gulped. 

“That couldn’t be!” He shook his 
head. “Oddball and the teletype girl 
had just gone out — ” 

“I studied your folder with con- 
siderable care.” She failed to say 
why. “I am certain that you were 
picked up on a Monday.” 

Ryeland felt a tingle of excite- 
ment. This was more than he had 
ever been able to learn about the 
case against him. 

“I suppose it’s possible,” he mut- 
tered. “At first' I was in a place mis- 
called a recreation center, some- 
where underground. We weren’t al- 
lowed to inquire where. The therapy 
sessions went on around the clock. 
I had no way of knowing the time 
or the date. 

“But I still don’t know how to 
build a reactionless propulsion sys- 
tem. And I still believe that the Ma- 
chine has permitted itself to make 
a mistake.” 



Donna Creery shook her head re- 
provingly. 

Ryeland stopped, the collar tight 
around his neck. This was crazy! 
Staying here like this with the Plan- 
ner’s daughter! He said abruptly, 
harshly: “Miss Creery, I’m interrupt- 
ing your bath. I must go!” 

She laughed, like a shimmer of 
pale music. “I don’t want you to,” 
she coaxed. 

“But — your bath — ” 

“I always stay in the tub in these 
subtrain rides, Steven. It’s comfort- 
able, when the up-grav drag begins 
to work. And don’t worry about my 
father. He rules the world — under 
the Plan, of course! But he doesn’t 
rule me.” She was smiling. She could 
hardly be twenty, Ryeland thought 
ruefully, but there was no more 
doubt in his mind that she knew she 
was a woman. She said comfortably: 
“Sit down, Steven. There. On the 
bench.” 

One slim arm, wearing wristlets 
of foam, gestured at an emerald 
bench next to the tub. The doves 
moved nervously as he approached. 
Donna Creery said: “Don’t be afraid 
of my Peace Doves.” He looked 
quizzically at the silver-steel beaks. 
“Oh, I’m sorry they hurt your 
friend,” she apologized, “but they 
thought he was going to hurt me. 
You see, even without the guard I 
am protected.” 

She waved a hand, and faint 
music seeped into the room from 
concealed speakers. “What was the 
girl like?” she demanded. 

“She was beautiful,” he said short- 

iy- 

“And dangerous?”

H e nodded, but under the 
heavy weight of the collar the 
stiff hairs at the back of his neck 
were trying to rise. Dangerous? 
This girl was far more dangerous to 
him. He had no right to be here. 
The Machine would not be blind to 
this. But Donna Creery said sooth- 
ingly: “Tell me about her. Was she 
really lovely?” 

“I believed she was. She had long 
yellow hair and green eyes. Eyes 
like yours. And she was in the secret 
police, but I didn’t know that until 
the day of the raid.” 

Laughter pealed from the girl’s 
lips, and the Peace Doves fluttered 
their wings fretfully for balance. 
“And she betrayed you. Are you 
afraid I might? But I won’t, Steven, 
I promise.” 

He shrugged. “I’ve told you. I 
suppose I was lucky, at that. I was 
sent to a maximum-security camp. 
It could have been the Body Bank.” 
She tilted her head to ponder 
24 



that, and he watched the red glints 
flow through the dark waves of her 
hair. A last she sighed and said, 
“And for that you became a Risk. 
But you should have been more care- 
ful, Steven. You should not have 
defied the Plan. And now you have 
to wear that collar. Can’t you get 
it off?” 

He laughed sharply. 

She said seriously: “No, I suppose 
not. But if I were you, I think I 
might. You said you were a mathe- 
matician. If I were a mathematician, 
and wore the collar, it would be 
only one more problem for me. I 
would find a way to solve it.” 

He said with a touch of anger: 
“The collar was invented by Colonel 
Zamfirescu, the best engineer in the 
Technicorps — before he was sal- 
vaged himself. He thought of every- 
thing.” 

“It’s only a metal band, Steven.” 

“The toughest armor plate in the 
world! And inside it there’s a de- 

IF 




capitation charge, fused with a hy- 
drogen power cell — it won’t last 
forever, no, but it will keep full 
power for a century! And that’s 
longer than I can wait. And the col- 
lar’s booby-trapped. If I try to cut 
it open — if I even try to unlock it, 
and use the wrong key, or turn it 
the wrong way — it will kill me on 
the spot. Have you ever seen a de- 
capitation charge go off, Miss 
Creery? I have.” 

She shuddered, but she said: “If 
I were you, I would run away.” 
“Not very far! Radar runs faster. 
And even if you could get away — 
out to the Cold Planets, say, or to 
one of the orbiting stations around 
Mercury — there’s a timing device 
in the collar. It has to be reset 
periodically, with a key. If not — 
boom. And you never know when; 
just that it will be less than a year.” 
“Oh.” She shook her head sadly. 
“Then you must take it off,” she said 
wisely. 

THE REEFS OF SPACE 



He laughed out loud; he couldn’t 
help it. The idea was preposterous! 

“Don’t laugh, Steven. Ron Don- 
derevo did,” she told him. 

“Donderevo! What do you know 
about Donderevo?” 

She said, “Oh, a little. I knew 
him, you see, when I was very small. 
I remember seeing him with the 
collar — and I saw him again, with- 
out.” 

He stopped, staring. He began: 
“You saw Donderevo — ” 

But there was a sudden, harsh 
knocking at the door. “Miss Creery!” 
a worried male voice clamored. 
“The Planner has sent for that 
Risk!” 

Ryeland sat bolt upright. For a 
moment he had forgotten; the voice 
had brought him back to the realities 
of his life. 

The girl said, “You’ll have to go, 
Steven.” She whispered, and one of 
the Peace Doves restlessly rose frojn 
her shoulders and circled the room, 



23 



its hot red eyes fixed on Ryeland. 
It touched the door, and without 
sound the door opened. “Be care- 
ful,” the girl said gently. “And don’t 
think too much about Angela.” 
“All right,” Ryeland said, numb, 
walking like a mechanical man to 
where the radar-horned officer of 
the Planner’s guard waited for him, 
with an expression like malevolent 
granite. It wasn’t until the door had 
slid silently closed behind him that 
he remembered he had never men- 
tioned the name of the girl who be- 
trayed him, his teletype girl, Angela 
Zwick. 

F or all of Ryeland’s life the 
Planner had been watching 
him. That fearless, genial, giant face 
had looked down on him from 
stereo posters in the home of his 
parents, the barracks of the Techni- 
cubs, the classrooms of his school 
— in every public square, and all 
the laboratories and buildings where 
he had worked. Ryeland knew that 
face as well as his own father’s — 
better — and so did every other 
human alive. 

The Planner sat behind a great 
hardwood desk in a chair that was 
all air cushions and cunning springs. 
He was looking absorbedly through 
a folder of papers on his desk. Un- 
comfortably Ryeland stood waiting. 

There was no resemblance be- 
tween the Planner and his daughter. 
She was brunette and lovely, with 
the face of a child saint; he was 
square and silver, a lion’s face. His 
hair was short, gray-white; it sat 
firmly on his head like a collision 
mat. And over his head, on the back 
26 



of the great chair, a steel-gray fal- 
con sat frozen; but it was not an 
ornament, for slowly metal-sheath- 
ed eyes opened and tiny bright red 
eyes peered out at Ryeland. 

At last the Planner looked up and 
smiled. He said in a velvet bass 
voice: “Son, don’t you check in?” 
Ryeland jumped. “Oh. Sorry, sir.” 
He hurried over to the gold-plated 
teletype and tapped out his name. 
The station plate on the machine 
said simply: “ONE”. 

The old man chuckled. “You’re 
Steven Ryeland. I saw you once be- 
fore, but you wouldn’t remember 
that.” 

Ryeland started. “Sir?” 

“It was a long time ago, boy,” 
the Planner said contemplatively. “I 
visited your home; you were a baby. 
Don’t look shocked. You see, I knew 
your father.” 

Ryeland staggered. He was half 
floating as the hurtling sphere reach- 
ed maximum velocity, hundreds of 
miles under the open air; but it was 
not that which made him dizzy, nor 
even the fact that he had not eaten 
for nearly a full day; it was this man 
on the other side of the desk. He 
said incredulously: “Sir, my parents 
never said anything about knowing 
the Planner. Surely they would have 

been proud ” 

The Planner laughed, a glorious 
huge laugh. “My boy,” he cried, “it’s 
a wise child, eh? And you are not 
that wise. You don’t know much 
about your parents. They were not 
proud of knowing me at all; they 
were ashamed because, you see, 
your father hated me very much.” 
He nodded, the smile drying on his 

IF 




face. His voice became like the rasp 
of a file. “Your father was an enemy 
of the Plan!” he barked. 

“Sir,” Ryeland protested, “I don’t 
know anything about my father. He 
disappeared when I was young. And 
my mother never told me that.” 
“She wouldn’t,” the Planner said 
savagely. “She was a dangerous 
woman, but not a stupid one. Nei- 
ther of your parents were stupid, 
Ryeland; so how is it that you are?” 
Ryeland said baffled: “Sir?” 
“You’re a Risk!” rasped the Plan- 
ner. “You should not have dared 
defy the Plan. That was an act of 
stupidity!” 

Ryeland took a deep breath. Per- 
haps this was his chance to get his 
case on the record. He began: “Sir, 
let me explain. I had no intention 
of defying the Plan. There was a 
girl who reported me, and the Ma- 
chine reclassified me as a Risk. I 
think this was an error, but — ” 

“You question the Machine?” 
“No, sir. Not the Machine, but 
the information that — ” 

“Never mind!” snapped the Plan- 
ner. “I don’t want you to incriminate 
yourself further. You are your fa- 
ther’s son, and you, must remember 
that everything you do is suspect 
for that reason. 

I t took Ryeland’s breath away. 

For a moment he couldn’t 
speak. He stood there, weaving 
slightly in the unsteady footing as 
the sphere rolled restlessly about in 
the beginning of its up-drive back 
to the surface. 

Then he burst out: “Sir, do I un- 
derstand you? You’re saying that 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



the Machine considers me a Risk 
because of what my father may 
have done before I was born! That’s 
not fair. That’s — ” 

“Fair!” bellowed the Planner, 
while the raven opened its tiny eyes 
and whirred restlessly over his head. 
“What sort of word is that, Ryeland? 
‘Fairness.’ ‘Freedom.’ ‘Democracy.’ 
All those words your father used to 
use, they run in the blood. And they 
mean nothing. What does ‘fairness’ 
have to do with seventeen hundred 
and fifty calories a day? 

“Fairness,” he sneered, “is used 
up, gone, spent! Do you know what 
your blessed ancestors did, boy? 
They mined ‘fairness’ and ‘demo- 
cracy’ from the untapped resources 
of the world. They didn’t invent 
them, they mined them — just as 
the old farmers mined minerals 
from their cornfields, twenty crops 
of corn and a foot of soil! Well, the 
topsoil’s gone now. And so is fair- 
ness and freedom. The world is a 
closed system now boy, and there 
isn’t enough to go around!” 

The ferocity of the outburst left 
Ryeland stunned. “But — but sir,” 
he said, “surely the far planets offer 
new frontiers, new resources — ” 

“Be still!” barked the Planner, the 
square silver head thrust forward 
like a hammer. Above him the steel- 
gray falcon whirred threateningly. 

The Planner glowered up at Rye- 
land, shifting his position in the com- 
pensating chair as the subtrain b^- 
gan its up-grav thrust. Weight came 
back to normal, then more than 
normal. Planner Creery said: “Rye- 
land, you’re like your father. He 
never learned that the frontier was 



27 




gone, but you must. The Plan of 
Man is based upon a systematic re- 
duction of the pernicious personal 
liberties that almost destroyed our 
world. War! Dust bowls! Floods! 
Forest fires!” Each word was a foul 
epithet; he spat them at Ryeland. 
“We have to pay the bill for the 
waste that has gone before — waste 
that your father, and those like him, 
would have spread. Never forget it, 
boy!” 

Ryeland stood silent. There was 
no reasoning with this man; there 
was a power and assurance that a 
gun might shatter, but no human 
power ever could. After a moment 
Ryeland said: “I haven’t forgotten.” 
Nor ever would, he thought. Not 
while the collar weighed around his 
neck. 

“The collar bothers you,” said the 
Planner surprisingly, and grinned. It 
was as though he had read Rye- 
land’s thoughts — easy enough, 
Ryeland realized. “But we all wear 
them, boy. Each one of us, from 
the Planner down to the castoffs 
waiting for salvage in the Body 
Bank, must account to the Machine 
for every hour of every day; and 
each of us wears the Machine’s 
shackle. On some of us they’re in- 
tangible,” he explained gravely, “and 
I admit that that does make a dif- 
ference.” 

Unwillingly Ryeland smiled. Not 
only power, he realized; the man 
had personality, charm — even to use 
on a Risk. 

“But if you like,” the Planner add- 
ed, off-handedly, “you can get that 
particular collar off your own par- 
ticular neck.” 



F or a moment Ryeland couldn’t 
believe what he had heard. 
“Get the collar off, sir?” 

The Planner nodded majestically. 
He shifted his position again, touch- 
ing a button. The massive, cushion- 
ed chair inclined slightly backward. 
The raven flapped with a tinkling 
metallic sound into the air, hover- 
ing, as a neck-rest rose out of the 
chair’s back and enveloped the 
Planner’s silver head. The subtrain 
sphere was well into its .upward 
thrust now. A faint squeal filtered 
through the soundproofing of the 
room — testimony of the pressure 
that forced the car against the in- 
visible, unfeelable wall of electro- 
static force. It wasn’t friction that 
made the squeal, but a heterodyne 
of vibrations from the generators 
that drove the car. Ryeland stagger- 
ed as his weight grew. 

The Planner said suddenly: “We 
are all bound to the Plan in one way 
or another. I must try to find un- 
breakable links that can replace 
your iron collar — or you must find 
them yourself; then the collar can 
come off.” 

Ryeland said desperately: “Surely 
my work proves that I am loyal.” 
“Surely it does not!” the Planner 
mocked. He shook his head like a 
great father bear with a naughty 
cub. “It is not what you have done 
already,” he reproved, “but what 
you can do now that will matter. 
You have worked freely, Ryeland; 
perhaps brilliantly, but you must 
work within the Plan. Always. Every 
moment. The Planning Machine 
will assign you a task. If you com- 
plete it — ” 



29 



IF 




He shrugged, with an effort. 

Ryel&nd was gasping now, the 
tag of his flesh a trap as the sub- 
train sphere forced its way up from 
Earth’s molten center. He wanted 
to talk — question the Planner — 
perhaps leave the secret of those 
missing days. But his body refused. 
All around them was white-hot rock 
under pressure; only the electrosta- 
tic hoops kept it out; they were 
down many miles, but now rising. 
It was like an elevator again, but 
going up. The vertical component 
of the sphere’s speed was rapidly 
reaching a hundred and fifty miles 
an hour; and even the Planner’s 
voice, cushioned and protected as 
he was, began to grow hoarse and 
slow. 

“You’d better go now, Ryeland,” 
he grumbled. “But would you like 
to know what your task will be?” 

Ryeland didn’t answer — he 
couldn’t; but his eyes answered for 
him. The Planner chuckled slowly. 
“Yes, of course. The Machine thinks 
you can handle it. It sounds — 
Well,” said the Planner thoughtfully, 
“we each have our part to play, and 
mine is not necessarily to under- 
stand everything the Machine re- 
quires. Your task is to develop a jet- 
less drive.” 

Ryeland rocked, and clutched 
frantically at the edge of the Plan- 
ner’s huge desk. “A — a jetless 
drive?” 

The Planner looked somberly 
amused. “I see,” he said. “Perhaps 
your task does not include under- 
standing it either? But that is what 
the Machine asks of you.” 

“You mean — ” Ryeland tried to 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



recover his breath. “You mean, a 
reactionless propulsion system?” 
“Precisely.” 

“Do you know that your torture 
experts — you* reconstruction ther- 
apists — have been trying for three 
years to make me tell them how to 
build a jetless drive? They seem to 
think I know how.” 

“I know.” The big m£n shrugged. 
“I know their efforts failed. The 
Machine had received information 
that you had designed such a mech- 
anism. Apparently that information 
was mistaken. But the past three 
years have made such a device 
more than ever essential to the se- 
curity of the Plan — more than 
ever dangerous to the Plan, if it 
should fall into unfriendly hands. 

“The Machine requires a jetless 
drive. Its records of your abilities 
and achievements indicate that you 
are qualified to develop such a de- 
vice. I have decided to disregard 
the evidence of your unplanned be- 
havior, the problem of whether 
your amnesia is real or assumed, 
voluntary or not. If you want to 
come out of your collar in one 
piece, you will design a working 
method of reactionless propulsion. 
Now,” he said in an exhausted 
voice, “you must go.” 

Through a haze Ryeland saw him 
make a faint motion with the huge 
gnarled hand that lay on the arm 
of his chair. The raven shifted posi- 
tion ever so little and beat the air 
frantically with its steel wings. 
Across the room a door opened. 

One of the Planner’s guard offi- 
cers came in. He was a giant of a 
man, but he stepped very carefully 

29 




under the thrust of the sphere’s 
climb. 

“Ryeland,” whispered the great 
old man behind the desk. 

Ryeland turned, half leaning on 
the officer in guard blu&. 

“About my daughter,” said the 
Planner softly. The squeal had be- 
come a roar, almost drowning him 
out. “Donna has a soft heart, which 
■he inherited from her mother; but 
her brain she inherited from me. 
Do not attach importance to the 
fact that she allowed you to talk with 
her in her bath.” And the old man’s 
eyes closed, as the Planner allowed 
his head to slump back at last. 

in 

M achine Major Chatterji said 
comfortingly: “You’ll like us 
here, Ryeland. We’re a brisk outfit, 
brisk.” 

“Yes, sir.” Ryeland looked around 
him. He was in a steel-walled cubicle 
with a Security designation. He had 
no idea where on, or under, Earth 
he might be. 

“You don’t have to worry about 
nonsense,” the major chattered. “Get 
the work done, that’s all we care 
about.” 

Ryeland nodded. The little major 
moved with the youthful grace of a 
kitten. He wore the radar-horned 
helmet of a risk-pusher debonairely, 
as though it were part of a fancy- 
dress c6stume. He caught Ryeland’s 
glance. 

“Oh, that,” he said, embarrassed. 
“Confounded nuisance, of course. 
But you are a Risk and the Ma- 
chine’s orders — ” 

30 



“1 m used 10 it.” 

“Not that you're the only Risk 
here,” Major Chatterji added quick- 
ly. “Heavens, no! Some of our best 
men, and all that.” 

Ryeland interrupted, “Excuse me, 
Major.” He bent to the teletype and 
rapidly typed out his identification 
number and the fact that he had ar- 
rived. Without delay the teletype 
rapped out: 

R. Information. Machine Maj- 
or Chatterji is authorized 4 tc re- 
consider your status. Action. Re- 
quisition necessary equipment 
for expansion of equations re 
unified force field and steady- 
state hypothesis. 

Ryeland frowned. Major Chatter- 
ji, peeking over his shoulder at the 
gray teletype, cried: “At once, Steve! 
Oh, we move fast here. I’ll have a 
six-deck calculator and a room to 
put it in before you can change your 
clothes, I’ll bet you a lakh of dollars!” 
Ryeland said: “I don’t understand. 
‘Unified force field and steady-state 
hypothesis’ — what’s that about?” 
But the major was cheerfully igno- 
rant. Administration was his job; 
Ryeland would find out everything 
else in due course, wouldn’t he? Rye- 
land shrugged. “All right. But I 
won’t need the calculator — not if 
Oporto is still around.” 

“The other Risk?” Machine Major 
Chatterji winked. “Always stick to- 
gether,” he nodded. “I’ll have him 
detailed to you.” 

Ryeland looked again at the tele- 
type. The truly important part of 
the message also needed some 
thought. Machine Major Chatterji is 

IF 




authorized to reconsider your status . 
Then this man here, with the liquid 
black eyes and the lean, hooked 
nose, this was the man who could 
turn the key that would unlock 
the iron collar? 

Or was that the wrong assumption 
to make? The Machine was always 
exact. But sometimes the mere hu- 
man who read its message failed to 
understand the meaning. For in- 
stance, did that message mean that 
Machine Major Chatterji could clear 
Ryeland — or did it mean that he 
could downgrade him . say from 
Risk to raw material for the Body 
Bank? 

It was a sobering thought. 

The faded unreality of everything 
in his past except his knowledge of 
science left Ryeland with a nagging 
sense of bewilderment and loss. 

“Why does the Machine need a 
jetless drive?” Uneasily, he put the 
question to Major Chatterji. “The 
ion jet ships are good enough to 
reach the planets — and anyhow 
the Plan of Man seems to be re- 
treating from space and burrowing 
into the Earth.” 

“Stop it!” Chatterji warned him 
sharply. “Such speculation is no part 
of our function.” 

Ryeland insisted, “The Machine 
seems to be afraid that a jetless 
drive in the wrong hands would be 
dangerous to the Plan. Whose hands 
could that be? The Plan has con- 
quered all the planets, taken in the 
whole human race. Except for a few 
fugitives like Ron Donderevo — ” 

“Don’t talk about him!” Chatterji 
looked shocked. “Our own function 
here is enough to keep us busy with- 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



out any such unplanned talk.” 
Ryeland shrugged and gave it up, 
and Chatterji at once reverted to 
his cheerful bustle. 

“We’ve got to get you settled,” he 
beamed, his gold-rimmed glasses 
flashing. “Faith! Come in here, girl.” 
The door opened. A tall blonde 
strutted in. She wore tight scarlet 
pants and a brief scarlet jacket. Two 
centuries before she would have 
been a drum majorette; under the 
Plan she had a more important role 
to play. “This is Faith, Steve. She’s 
one of our Togetherness girls. She’ll 
help you get adjusted here, I prom- 
ise!” 

The Togetherness girl smiled a 
lacquered smile. She piped: “ ‘Per- 
form your own function perfectly 
— and your own function only.’ 
That’s our motto here, Mr. Rye- 
land.” It was like a doll talking. 

“And a splendid motto it is!” 
Major Chatterji endorsed, beaming. 
“Get him started, Faith. And don’t 
forget the Togetherness meeting at 
nineteen hundred hours.” 

R yeland’s mind was teeming with 
jetless drives and the steady- 
state hypothesis and three miss- 
ing days and Major Chatterji is 
authorized to reconsider and the fact 
that the Planner had known about 
his interview with Donna in her 
bath. But this was important too; 
he swept the other things out of his 
mind and tried to pay attention to 
what the Togetherness girl was say- 
ing. 

“You’ll like it here, Steve,” she 
whispered, solemnly squeezing his 
arm. She smiled up at him, and 

31 




steered him down a gray-walled con- 
crete tunnel. There were no win- 
dows. “This is Point Circle Black. 
Sounds confusing, doesn’t it? But 
you’ll learn. I’ll teach you!” Point 
Circle Black was the headquarters 
office, where Major Chatterji, the 
administrative officer, fussed end- 
lessly over his problems of supply 
and personnel. “Point Triangle 
Gray.” Faith sang, waving at an in- 
tersection ahead. “That’s the medical 
section. Tests and diseases, injuries 
and — ” she giggled naughtily — 
“supply depot for the Body Bank.” 
Ryeland grunted. 

“Oh, that’s nothing for you to 
worry about, Steve,” she said reas- 
suringly. “Trust Major Chatterji. 
You do your part and he’ll do his; 
that’s Teamwork.” 

Ryeland mumbled, “I understand. 
It’s just that — well, I’ve had to 
face the chance of the Body Bank 
for three years now. I admit I don’t 
like the idea of being butchered.” 
She stopped, scandalized, her per- 
fect eyebrows arched, her clear eyes 
wide. “Butchered? Steve, what an 
unplanned word!” 

“I only meant — ” 

“The Planned term,” she said 
firmly, “is ‘salvaged’. And you can’t 
deny the logic of the Machine, can 
you?” She didn’t wait for an answer. 
She was well into her set speech. 
“The Body Bank,” she parroted, 
“provides the attack team with the 
necesary stimulus to insure maxi- 
mum effort. If the effort is success- 
ful, the team has nothing to fear. 
If the effort fails — ” 

She shrugged winsomely. “The 
welfare of the Plan of Ijdan,” she 
32 



said, “requires that they must make 
their contribution in another way. 
That is, their physical organs must 
contribute to the repair of more use- 
ful citizens. That’s Teamwork!” 
“Thanks,” said Ryeland grumpily. 
The isolation camp on the rim of 
the Arctic Circle, he thought wist- 
fully — it had been hard and dull 
and uncomfortable; but at least he 
hadn’t been exposed to lectures from 
teen-aged girls! 

P oint Triangle Gray was a Secur- 
ity designation; all the names 
were. The whole area was called 
Team Center. It might have been 
under Lake Erie or the Indian 
Ocean; Ryeland never learned. 

At Point Triangle Gray he was 
given his tests. He caught a glimpse 
of Oporto, looking healthy enough 
but somehow crestfallen; they 
waved, but there was no chance to 
speak as Oporto came out of one 
laboratory room while Ryeland was 
going into another. At least, Rye- 
land thought, the little man hadn’t 
been salvaged. 

Then he forgot about Oporto for 
five rigorous hours. Point Triangle 
Gray measured his functional in- 
dices and his loyalty quotients with 
every test that he had ever under- 
gone before and one or two that 
were brand new to him. The lab 
men stripped him and clamped him 
in their metering devices, while the 
interrogators demanded every detail 
of his life, back to the toys his moth- 
er had given him for his third birth- 
day. 

In these tests he tasted the after- 
bitterness of those sessions in the 

IP 




therapy room at the “recreation 
center” — those long, endless ages 
when he was punished and punished 
again because he could not make 
sense of the crazy questions the ther- 
apists flung at him. He dreaded, 
each moment now, that in the next 
moment it would start again. Some- 
one would fling him a quesion 
about pyropods or Ron Donderevo. 
Someone would ask him about the 
missing three days in his life, or de- 
mand that he draw them the plans 
for a device he’d never heard of. 

But it didn’t happen; the ques- 
tions were all routine. 

In fact, every one of the questions 
had been asked him before — some 
of them a hundred times. Every an- 
swer had long since been recorded 
for the memory drums of the Plan- 
ning Machine. But the interrogation 
went on. His reactions were studied 
in blinding actinic light, and photo- 
graphed by infra-red in what to him 
was utter dark. His body fluids were 
sampled again and again. Whole 
salvos of injections stimulated and 
calmed him, and for a short time 
put him to sleep — while heaven 
knew what pokings by scalpel and 
probe investigated the muscle ten- 
sions of his innermost system. 

But at last it was over. 

He was dressed in new crisp scar- 
let slacks and tunic and propelled 
into the gray concrete corridors 
where Faith was waiting, the lac- 
quered smile on her face and her 
eyes glad. 

“You’ve passed!” she sang. “But I 
knew you would. And now you’re 
a full member of the Team.” 

She led him away carolling: “Next 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 




I’ll show you your quarters. They’re 
nice, Steve! And then, oh, there’s so 
much here! You’ll like the Together- 
ness Canteen. You’ll have wonderful 
work facilities. Everything is fine — 
and, of course, that’s only fair, isn’t 
it? Because so much is expected of 
you people on the Attack Team. 
You’re entitled to a great deal in re- 
turn; that’s Teamwork!” 

She led him about for an hour, 
and she did not stop chattering once. 
She took him to a sort of mess hall 
to be fed — alone; he was late for 
dinner, due to the tests at Point 
Triangle Gray, and the others were 
all through. The food was General 
Workers A-Ration — about the 
same as at the maximum-security 
camp, though somewhat less of it in 
terms of calories. But it was pleas- 
ant to be allowed to sit and smoke 
after the meal. And she showed him 
his quarters. 



a 



They were comfortable. A rather 
surprisingly soft bed, a bookcase (al- 
ready Machine Major Chatterji had 
stocked it with conversion tables and 
reference books), a more than ade- 
quate chest for the personal belong- 
ings he had long since ceased to 
own. “Isn’t it nice?” the Together- 
ness girl enthused. “But we’ll have 
to hurry, Steve. It’s almost nineteen 
hundred hours!” 

T he Togetherness Canteen was 
high over the maze of tunnels 
that comprised Team Center. Its 
gray concrete was liberally splashed 
with bright colors. 

It was full of light and sound and 
people. There were nearly twenty 
Togetherness girls as pretty as Faith; 
they danced with laughing officers 
of the Technicorps, sat with them at 
tables, sang with them around a 
piano. There were hurrying wait- 
resses as pretty as the Togetherness 
girls, or almost, bringing drinks and 
light refreshment. And there were 
the officers — Ryeland’s new col- 
leagues. 

They all wore the crisp scarlet 
uniform; and his heart bounded, for 
three of them at least, he saw, wore 
the same iron collar as himself. But 
they were laughing. One danced 
with a red-headed girl as tall as he, 
two were in a card game. 

The iron collar did not seem to 
weigh heavily on these Risks. 

Ryeland took a deep, wondering 
breath. Maybe this place was the 
place he had hoped for all those 
three years. 

One side of the room was an 
enormous window, twenty feet tall, 
34 



made of armor-glass. Outside weath- 
ered cliffs were splashed with orange 
sun, nearly set. The tops of pines 
swayed in an unheard wind, and a 
far mountain slope was splotched 
with evergreens and golden autumn 
aspen. 

Faith touched his arm. “What’s 
wrong, Steve? Afraid of high 
places?” 

He had hardly noticed the scen- 
ery; his thoughts had been on his 
collar. But he blinked and came 
awake. “I — I didn’t know where 
this place was, until I saw the out- 
side.” 

“You still don’t know,” she 
laughed. “Come along. You’ll want 
to meet the Team leader.” 

General Fleemer had big bulg- 
ing eyes and a tight uniform; it made 
him look like a very important frog. 
“So you’re Steve Ryeland?” The gen- 
eral pumped his hand, the bulging 
eyes glowing with friendly Together- 
ness. “Glad to have you, Steve!” He 
grinned and flicked the iron collar 
with a fingernail. It rang faintly. 
“We’ll have that off you in no time. 
Give us results, we’ll give you your 
clearance! What could be fairer?” 

He caught Steve by the other el- 
bow, the one Faith wasn’t using, 
and carried him off. Faith trailed 
along. “Want you to meet some of 
the others,” he boomed. “Here. Pas- 
cal! Come over here. Steve, I want 
you to meet — ” 

“But I already know Colonel Les- 
cure,” said Ryeland. It was the gray- 
haired Technicorps officer who had 
conducted them to Compartment 93 
on the Planner’s subtrain. 

The colonel nodded, and took 

IF 




him aside for a moment while Gen- 
eral Fleemer rounded up more of 
the Team. “I didn’t want to say any- 
thing before — but I knew you were 
coming here. And I’m glad. Your 
— ah — interview was a success, 
eh?” And he nudged Ryeland’s ribs. 

It occurred to Ryeland that the 
colonel might not have been nearly 
as jolly with him if the interview 
hadn’t been a success, but he let it 
pass. “Yes,” he said, “the Planner 
was quite — ” 

“Planner?” Colonel Lescure wink- 
ed. “I mean the other interview, son! 
She’s quite a girl!” It seemed, 
thought Steve Ryeland, that there 
was hardly a human under the Plan 
of Man who wasn’t aware that he 
had spent three-quarters of an hour 
with Donna Creery in her bath. 

“Over here!” cried the general, 
beckoning. “You too, Otto!” As Rye- 
land reached the general Colonel 
Otto Gottling stumped over, his 
face like a rock. He was a jet com- 
bustion expert, as it turned out; his 
chamber had powered the last 
twelve rockets built for the out- 
planet run. 

Everyone was a specialist and 
Ryeland found it uncommonly dif- 
ficult to figure out where the spe- 
cialties fit together. Colonel Lescure, 
he discovered, was Director of the 
Plan of Space Biology, for example. 
A major named Max Lunggren was 
an astrophysicist. There were two 
other mathematicians — one an ex- 
pert in number theory, the other 
whose name was vaguely familiar 
to Ryeland as the author of a paper 
on normed rings. (Coincidentally — 
or was it coincidence? — both of 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



them wore the collars of Risks.) 
The third Risk was a food chemist, 
a fat, jolly man who owned a fund 
of limericks. 

But some hours later Ryeland re- 
ceived a clue, at least; the evening 
was not entirely devoted to Togeth- 
erness. 

TTIThen everyone was satisfac- 
* Morily mellow General Fleem- 
er climbed atop a table and ham- 
mered it with his heel for attention. 

“A toast!” he bawled. “I give you 
Teamwork — and the Plan!” 

There was a rousing roar. Fleemer 
drained his glass with them and then 
turned serious. “Some of you,” he 
cried, “wonder what our Team At- 
tack is aimed at. Well, you’ll find 
out! But for the benefit of the new 
people, first let me review the over- 
all philosophy of the Team Attack 
itself. It is the essential tool of our 
scientific progress, and too impor- 
tant to be taken for granted!” 
“Hurray for Team Attack!” bawl- 
ed one of the iron-collar mathema- 
ticians, amid a giggle of the To- 
getherness girls around him. 

General Fleemer smiled, quell- 
ing him. He said: “Once upon a 
time — so our Team historians tell 
me — science was done by individ- 
ual men. Some of you may think it 
is still done that way.” He gave a 
frosty grin to Ryeland and the other 
Risks. “But that is all over. The 
turning point came with the Ein- 
stein Team, which met at a town 
called Hiroshima to attack the pri- 
mary problem of atomic fission. 

“Unfortunately,” the general said 
sadly, holding out his glass for a 

35 




refill, “these pioneers were destroyed 
by the unexpected success of their 
first experiment with uranium fis- 
sion. But the principle of team at- 
tack survived! 

“Since then the Plan of Man has 
refined the principles and polished 
the techniques of Team Attack. 
When the Plan of Man requires a 
new scientific discovery, a team is 
created to make it. Such a team is 
needed now — and you are my 
Team, all of you!” 

There was prolonged cheering. 

Then Fleemer paused. He smiled, 
and it was a scorpion’s smile, vastly 
out of character in that wattled 
marshmallow face. 

He said: “I’m sure you all under- 
stand why you can be counted on to 
do your best.” He nodded merrily 
to Ryeland and the other iron-collar 
men. “When you succeed, you will 
learn that Teamwork operates both 
ways. When you succeed. But if you 
fail — if you fail — why, then. 

He trailed off, and looked som- 
berly at the men for a second. 

Then he grinned and drew one 
pudgy finger across his non-existent 
neck. “Zzzzt! The Body Bank! But 
we won't fail !” 

There was a burst of laughter. 
Machine Major Chatterji leaped to 
a table, his glasses gleaming. “Three 
cheers for General Fleemer and the 
Plan of Man! Hip, hip — ” 

“Hooray!” The cheer was loud but 
ragged. 

“Hip, hip — ” 

“Hooray!” Louder now. The 
whole room was together. 

“Hip, hip ” 

“Hooray!” Ryeland found himself 



thundering along with the rest. He 
couldn’t help it. He had been born 
under the Plan of Man. He could 
not doubt it. It would have deprived 
his life of meaning, as the iron col- 
lar that was the Plan’s gift to him 
had, for a time, nearly deprived it 
of hope. 

There was loud applause. And 
General Fleemer, still smiling, raised 
his hand. “What the Machine needs,” 
he said, “is a new physical principle.” 
He shrugged winsomely — as best 
he could with those blubber shoul- 
ders. “I’m not a scientist, and I don’t 
know just how tough this job is go- 
ing to be. Probably some of you 
think it’s going to be very tough. 
Well,” he said, chuckling, “the rest of 
you are just going to have to con- 
vince them otherwise!” And he 
touched his finger jestingly to his 
throat. 

R yeland tried, but got little in- 
formation from the others. It 
wasn’t so much that they refused to 
tell; it was more that he couldn’t 
understand. The Machine would 
give him a detailed directive, they 
assured him, and wouldn’t he have 
another drink? 

And an hour later Faith offered 
to show him a short-cut home to 
his quarters. They linked arms and 
wandered off through the gray- 
walled corridors. “Here’s an area 
you’ve never seen,” she caroled. 
“See that? Point Nexus. That’s the 
Message Center.” 

“Lovely Message Center,” said 
Ryeland comfortably. Funny. Even 
the iron collar didn’t seem as hard 
or as cold. She was a sweet kind of 

IF 



36 




girl, he thought dreamily. Of course, 
the Togetherness girls were coached, 
reared — all but bred for that. But 
she reminded him of the Fair Lost 
One, Angela — about whom the 
Planner’s daughter had known more 
than she should. But of course it 
could have come from his personnel 
folder, and — 

“Point Crescent Green,” sang the 
girl, pointing to another stenciled 
emblem on the wall. 

“Lovely,” said Ryeland automati- 
cally, and then took a closer look. 
“But what’s going on?” 

The girl hesitated. 

She stopped in the middle of a 
word and frowned at Ryeland. “I tell 
you,” she said after a moment, sud- 
denly gay, “maybe this short-cut 
isn’t such a good idea. Back the 
other way there’s — ” 

“No, but look,” Ryeland insisted 
planting his feet as she tugged at 
him. It was quite late now, but there 
were a couple of guards in Team 
scarlet, and one of them was turn- 
ing a key to slide back a massive, 
lead-shielded door. Beyond was the 
floor of an enormous pit, lit by a 
bright single light, high up. 

Ryeland recognized it for what 
it was: A rocket landing pit. There 
were the 'great spreading girder arms 
of the gantry, the enormous ducts 
for the jet-baffles yawned black in 
the floor. A piece of his mind cata- 
logued the information that rocket 
landings commonly took place here; 
dim in the gloom behind the brilliant 
light were the enormous doors that 
would open to the sky. 

But there was no rocket in the 
pit. 

THE REEFS OF SPACE 



There was something else, some- 
thing in a heavy metal cage. 

“What is that thing?” Ryeland de- 
manded. It looked a little like the 
seals that Ryeland had seen sunning 
themselves on the rocks off the mrtax- 
imum-security camp; but it was 
golden — metallic gold, the^gold of 
the setting sun on bright metal, as 
it lay bathed in the wash of harsh 
light from above. 

The thing was alive. It was, how- 
ever, no animal that Ryeland had 
ever seen. 

It lay on the floor of the great 
metal cage as though exhausted by 
efforts to escape. The golden fur 
was bloodied and torn about its 
head. Some of the bars were bent 
and bloodstained. 

Whatever it was, it had fought to 
get free! 

The Togetherness girl said wor- 
riedly: “Come away, Steve. Please! 
Major Chatterji doesn’t want anyone 
to see the spaceling until — ” She 
gasped, confused. She begged: “For- 
get I said that! I shouldn’t have taken 
you this way at all, but — Oh, 
please, Steve, come away.” 

Reluctantly he let her lead him 
away. The guard had hurried inside 
and the enormous metal doors were 
closed; there was nothing more to 
see in any case. 

But what was it that he had seen? 

IV 

A t 0700 hours the next morn- 
ing the teletype rang him out 
of a deep sleep. Hardly stopping to 
open his eyes he leaped to answer. 
It clattered: 



37 




Query. Is Steven Ryeland, 
Risk, AWC-3S440, present? 

Ryeland blanched and instantly 
tapped out his acknowledgement. All 
human instincts ordered him to add 
an apology, but the Machine was not 
interested in apologies, only in com- 
pliance with its rules. It rapped back 
at him without pause: 

Information. Steady-s^ate hy- 
pothesis rests on theory of Fred 
Hoyle English astronomer phy- 
sicist 20th century stating that 
clouds hydrogen gas are contin- 
ually formed between stars thus 
replenishing matter converted 
into energy in stellar power pro- 
cesses. Action. Produce neces- 
sary mathematical statements 
showing when under what condi- 
tions process can occur. Action. 
Make statement as to feasibility 
additional mathematical state- 
ment providing basis for neu- 
tralizing or reversing hydrogen 
formation process. 

Ryeland stared. There was a brief 
tap at the door and the Together- 
ness girl danced in, carrying a tray 
with tea and toast and a glass of 
pinkish fruit juice. “Good morning, 
Steven! Rise and shine. I — oh!” 
He impatiently motioned her to be 
silent; the teletype, as though that 
were not enough for him to worry 
about in a single transmission, emit- 
ted the whir of marking impulses for 
a moment and then clattered out a 
new message: 

Information. Experimental ev- 
idence available indicating ex- 
istence of drive mechanism not 
subject to Newton Third Law Mo- 

38 



tion. Information. Said mechan- 
ism referred to as Jetiess Drive. 
Act ; 'n. Produce necessary math- 
ematical statements providing 
basis for reproducing Jetless 
Drive in Plan space vehicles. 
Action. Review work of Colonel 
Gottling unified force field as 
necessary first step. 

Ryeland pulled the tape out of 
the machine as soon as it was fin- 
ished and sat staring at it. Some- 
body, he reflected, had been trans- 
ferring information from his forbid- 
den books into the Machine! 

Gently Faith removed it from his 
fingers. “Breakfast,” she scolded. “A 
bath. You’ll think better when you’re 
more awake!” Groggily Steve allow- 
ed himself to be propelled toward 
the bath, his mind a whirl of hy- 
drogen clouds and non-Newtonian 
force fields. 

The steaming shower woke him. 
By the time he was dressed and sit- 
ting down to breakfast with the To- 
getherness girl he was alert. “Jetless 
drive!” he said. “But there can’t be 
such a thing. Newton’s law!” 
“Drink your tea, Steven,” she said 
soothingly. “Would the Machine 
ask you to do it if it were impos- 
sible?” 

“But 1 can’t — well, what experi- 
mental evidence? I haven’t seen any.” 
The Togetherness Girl looked in- 
conspicuously at the watch on her 
wrist. “Colonel Lescure will be wait- 
ing, Steve. Drink your tea.” 

T he colonel was very crisp in 
his uniform and white smock. 
He said: “You’re jittery, Ryeland. 
Relax.” 



IF 




Steve touched his iron collar sig- 
nificantly. The colonel smiled. “Oh, 
sure,” he said, “but you want to get 
it off, don’t you? And the best way 
is to relax, because your first job is 
to listen. I have to tell you about the 
reefs of space.” 

The reefs of space! Ryeland gulp- 
ed and tried to relax. A numbing 
fog of bewilderment and pain swirl- 
ed up around him, across the lost 
years at the maximum security 
camp. He was lying stretched on 
the couch in the therapy room, with 
the cold electrodes clamped to his 
wrists, and the blinding light blazing 
into his face. Dr. Thrale was stand- 
ing over him, fat and gentle and 
apologetic, wheezing out the words 
spaceling and pyropod and jetless 
drive and reefs of space, and me- 
thodically charting his reactions. 

“Relax, Ryeland.” The colonel’s 
voice buzzed out of a great gulf of 
distance. “We must take this prob- 
lem one step at a time. The first 
step is the information which I am 
to give you now.” 

“Sure,” Ryeland gasped. “I under- 
stand.” 

He was trying desperately to re- 
lax. Perhaps this information would 
answer the riddle of those three lost 
days. 

“Let’s have a drink;” the Colonel 
was suggesting. “Talking’s thirsty 
work.” 

Ryeland hesitated. Alcohol had 
always been forbidden, at the acad- 
emy and at the isolation camp. 

“Come on,” said the colonel, 
twinkling. “A transfusion won’t hurt 
the story.” 

He opened a cabinet and took out 



glasses and a little box. While he 
poured drinks, Ryeland urged: 
“Reefs of space? Meteor clouds, 
perhaps?” 

Pascal Lescure laughed. “More 
like coral reefs. Here.” He touched 
glasses. “That’s better,” he said com- 
fortably, tasting his drink, and he 
opened the little box. 

A collection of fantastic little ani- 
mals modeled in plastic spilled out. 
Ryeland glanced at them only ab- 
stractedly; his mind was on what 
Lescure had said. “But coral is built 
by living organisms.” 

The colonel nodded. “The reefs 
of space are built by living organ- 
isms, too — working over vastly 
longer stretches of time.” 

Ryeland set down his untouched 
glass violently, slopping it over. 
“What organisms live in space?” 

“Why,” the colonel said seriously, 
poking at his plastic toys with a fin- 
ger, “creatures very much like these. 
They were modeled from life. And 
before that — the creators of the 
reefs themselves, simple little one- 
celled organisms, originating — 
everywhere!” 

Ryeland forced himself to speak 
slowly, methodically: “The Ma- 

chine’s orders came this morning. 
I’m to investigate the steady-state 
hypothesis. And ever since then I’ve 
been thinking — about Hoyle’s 
steady-state theory, and about an- 
other speculation he made. That life 
was born before the planets were, 
created by the chemical action of 
ultraviolet light in the cooling clouds 
of gas and dust around the sun. But 
how could it survive? The clouds 
disappear as the planets form.” 



THE REEFS OF SPACE 



39 




“Life adapts,” the colonel said 
heavily, and poked at his dragons. 

He took a fresh drink. “Leaving 
out the intangibles,” he lectured, 
“life is a phenomenon of matter and 
energy. The Hoyle Effect provides 
the matter, in the clouds of new hy- 
drogen that are always being born 
between the stars. And life makes 
its own energy.” 

“How?” 

“By fusing the hydrogen into 
heavier elements,” the colonel said 
solemnly. 

He flicked a switch. A screen slid 
down out of the ceiling. An image 
appeared on it, the image of little 
darting bodies, flashing with light, 
crossing the field of vision. The pic- 
ture might have been one of pond 
life under a microscope, except for 
the difference in shapes . and for 
the fact that these creatures gave 
off a light of their own. “The fus- 
orians,” said the colonel somberly. 
“Hardy little things. They fuse hy- 
drogen atoms and generate energy, 
and they live in space.” 

Fusorians! Ryeland felt his body 
tense as though an electric shock 
had passed through it. He was con- 
scious of the colonel’s gaze on him, 
and tried to relax, but the colonel 
studied him thoughtfully for a mo- 
ment. 

He said only: “No wonder you’re 
excited.” He blinked at Ryeland 
mildly. “This thing is big. It means 
that the planets are not lonely oases 
in a dead desert of emptiness. It 
means that they are islands in an 
infinite ocean of life — strange life, 
which we had never suspected.” 

“But why haven’t any of them 



ever appeared on Earth?” Ryeland 
demanded. Infuriating how slowly 
Lescure spoke! It was life and death 
to Ryeland — perhaps it was the 
answer to all his questions — but 
the colonel treated it only as another 
lecture, and a rather dull one. 

The colonel shrugged. “Perhaps 
they drown in air. I suppose the 
heavier elements are their own 
waste products, and therefore poi- 
sonous to them.” He took another 
pull at his drink. “Perhaps these 
creatures built the Earth,” he said 
meditatively. “It accounts for the 
proportions of heavy elements bet- 
ter than the theories of the cosmolo- 
gists. But of course it doesn’t really 
matter — not to the Plan, I mean.” 

Ryeland frowned. There had 
been something almost disloyal 
about the colonel’s tone. He changed 
the subject. “These things — ” touch- 
ing the plastic models — “they aren’t 
fusorians?” 

“No. They’re pyropods. They 
live in the reefs.” Irritably the col- 
onel waved a hand. The screen 
glowed with another picture. 

R yeland leaned forward star- 
ing. “Fairyland!” he breathed. 
The colonel laughed harshly. The 
view on the screen was of a delicate 
tracery of glowing vines and plants, 
where birdlike things moved effort- 
lessly among the branches. 

“Call it that,” said the colonel. “I 
called it other things when I was 
there. You see, there is a constant 
ne^v flow of matter into the uni- 
verse. There is a steady rebirth of 
hydrogen between the stars. I know 
— I’ve seen it!” 



40 



IF 




Nervously he took another drink. 
“It was a few years ago. The pyro- 
pods had been seen, but none had 
been captured. The Planner ordered 
me out on a hunting trip to catch 
one.” 

Rveland frowned. “Hunting? But 
the Plan of Man has no energy to 
waste on that sort of thing! Every 
calorie must go to some productive 
use!” 

“You’re an apt pupil,” the colonel 
said wryly, “but it was the Machine’s 
decision, not mine. Or so the Plan- 
ner said. At any rate, we took off for 
the planet beyond Pluto. Was there 
one? It was necessary to assume 
one, to provide a home for the pyro- 
pods — or so we thought. We knew 
they had no home from Pluto sun- 
wards. 

“It was a long trip. You know 
why interstellar flight has never been 
possible. There’s power enough for 
us to reach the stars, but the diffi- 
culty is in finding the reaction mass 
to hurl away. Once you pass Orbit 
Pluto you begin to face those prob- 
lems in practice. We were in the 
old Cristobal Colon, with hydrion 
jets. Our reaction mass was water. 
All we could carry was barely 
enough to land us on the hypotheti- 
cal planet. We were to reload there 
for the flight home, if we found it.” 
The colonel chuckled dryly. “We 
didn’t find it,” he said. 

“Then — how did you get back?” 
Ryeland demanded, startled. 

“We blundered into something. 
What we called the Rim. Don’t con- 
fuse it with the Reefs of Space — 
it wasn’t them, not for billions of 
miles yet. It belongs to the solar 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 




system, a scattered swarm of little 
asteroids, strung in a wide orbit all 
around the sun. A ring of snowballs, 
actually. Cold snow — mostly meth- 
ane and ammonia; but we found 
enough water to refill our tanks. 
And then we went on. The Ma- 
chine’s orders had been definite.” 
The colonel shivered and finished 
his drink. “We went out and out,” 
he said, mixing a fresh one, “beyond 
the Rim, until the sun was just a 
bright star behind — then not even 
particularly bright. We were braking, 
on the point of turning back — 
“And then we saw the first Reef.” 
Colonel Lescure waved at the 
strange scene on the screen. He be- 
gan to look alive again. “It didn’t 
look like much at first. A mottled, 
lopsided mass, not much bigger 
than the snowballs. But it was 
luminous!” 

Ryeland found himself gulping 

41 



his drink. Silently he held out the 
empty glass and the colonel refilled 
it without pausing. 

“An unearthly place. We came 
down in a brittle forest of things 
like coral branches. Thickets of 
shining crystal thorns snagged at our 
spacesuits when we went out ex- 
ploring. We blundered through met- 
al jungles that tripped and snared us 
with living wires and stabbed at us 
with sharp blades. And there were 
stranger things still! 

“There were enormous lovely 
flowers that shone with uncanny 
colors — and gave off deadly gam- 
ma rays. There was a kind of golden 
vine that struck back with a high- 
voltage kick when you touched it. 
There were innocent little pods that 
squirted jets of radioactive isotopes. 

“It was a nightmare! But while we 
were reviving and decontaminating 
our casualties we worked out the 
natural history of the Reef. It was 
a cluster of living fusorian colonies! 

“We counted almost a hundred 
species. They must have grown 
from a few spores, drifting in the 
interstellar hydrogen. The rate of 
growth must be terribly slow — a 
few inches, perhaps, in a million 
years. But the fusorians have time. 

“We looked at each other. We 
knew we had found something more 
than we had been sent for. 

“We had found a new frontier.” 
Ryeland was on his feet, a sudden 
uncontrollable surge of emotion 
driving him there. “Frontier? Could 
— could people survive out there?” 
“Why not? They’re rich with 
everything we need. There’s hydro- 
gen for power, metal for machines, 
42 



raw materials for food. We brought 
treasures back with us! We loaded 
our ship with every sort of specimen 
we could carry. Fantastic diamond 
spikes, and masses of malleable iron 
in perfectly pure crystals. Living 
prisms that shone with their own 
cold glow of fusion. Spongy metal 
mushrooms, in hundred-pound 
chunks, that tested more than ninety 
per cent uranium-235. Much more 
than critical mass! And yet they 
didn’t explode, while tl]ey lived. But 
one chunk did let go after we had 
jettisoned it in space, and after that 
we were careful to divide the 
masses.” 

“So that's why the Machine needs 
a jetless drive?” Ryeland saw a ray 
of understanding, stabbing through 
the gray fog of confusion which had 
followed him from his suite in the 
maximum security camp. “To reach 
the reefs of space — because they’re 
beyond the range of our ion drives!” 
“I suppose so.” Lescure nodded. 
“Though such thinking goes a little 
beyond our function.” 

“But why would the Machine 
want to explore them?” Ryeland 
frowned at him. “Is there something 
in the reefs which could threaten 
the security of the Plan?” 

“Better not exceed our function,” 
Lescure warned him. “I imagine the 
planets are pretty well protected 
from the life of space, by their 
atmospheres and their Van Allen 
belts. But of course there was the 
pyronod that rammed us — ” 
“Pyropod?” 

For a second Ryeland was lying 
on his couch in the therapy room 
again, with the cold electrodes 

IF 




clamped on his body and Thrale’s 
apologetic voice lisping out the 
words that had been senseless to 
him then, jetless drive . fusorian 
. pyropod. 

Lescure’s eyes had narrowed. 

“Ryeland, you appear unduly agi- 
tated. I don’t quite understand your 
reactions — unless you have heard 
this story before.” 

“I have not.” That, at least, was 
true. The therapists had always been 
careful to tell him nothing at all 
about pyropods or fusorians or the 
reefs of space. 

For another uncomfortable mo- 
ment, Lescure stared. 

“Relax, then.” At last he smiled. 
“Forgive my question. I asked it be- 
cause there was an unfortunate 
breach of security. One member of 
my crew jumped ship after our re- 
turn. He had managed to steal un- 
authorized specimens and descrip- 
tions of the life of space. Of course 
he went to the Body Bank.” 

His eyes brushed Ryeland again, 
casually. 

“I forget the fellow’s name. Her- 
rick? Horlick? Horrocks?” 

Ryeland sat still, feeling numb. 

C olonel Lescure waved care- 
lessly, and the screen retracted, 
shutting itself off. “Drink?” he de- 
manded. Ryeland shook his head, 
waiting. 

Lescure sighed and poked through 
his plastic toys. “Here,” he said sud- 
denly. 

Ryeland took the tiny things from 
him, a two-inch figurine in black 
and silver with a wicked, knife- 
edged snout. Lescure’s glazed eyes 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



remained on it in fascination. “That’s 
the one that attacked us,” he said. 

“This little thing?” 

The colonel laughed. “It was nine- 
ty feet long,” he said. He took it 
back from Steve and patted it. 
“Vicious little creature,” he said, half 
fondly. “Evolution has made them 
vicious, Ryeland. They are living 
war rockets. They’ve been hammer- 
ed into a horrible ‘perfection, by 
eternities of evolution.” 

He swept the whole menagerie 
back into its box. “But they are only 
rockets,” he said thoughtfully. “They 
need mass, too. We’ve cut up a doz- 
en of them, and the squid is as 

much a rocket as they Perhaps 

that accounts for their voracity. 
They’ll attack anything, with a hun- 
gry fury you can’t imagine. Mass is 
not plentiful in space, and they need 
what they can find. 

“At any rate, this one rammed 
us, and — well, we had another 
dozen casualties.” The colonel 
shrugged. “It was touch and go, be- 
cause the thing was faster than we. 
But ultimately the survivors manned 
a torpedo station, and then the con- 
test was over. 

“Even the pyropods have not 
achieved a jetless drive.” 

“If there is such a thing,” said 
Ryeland. 

Colonel Lescure chuckled. He 
looked thoughtfully at Ryeland, as 
though choosing which of several 
to make. Finally he said: “You don’t 
think the Team Attack will suc- 
ceed?” 

Ryeland said stiffly: “I will do 
my best, Colonel. But Newton’s 
Third Law — ” 



43 




Colonel Lescure laughed aloud. 
“Ah, well,” he said, “who knows? 
Perhaps it won’t succeed. Perhaps 
there is no jetless drive.” Hilariously 
amused, though Ryeland could not 
tell why, he tossed the box of plastic 
figurines back in a cupboard. 

“Ugly little things, good night,” he 
said affectionately. 

Ryeland commented: “You sound 
as though you like them.” 

“Why not? They don’t bother us. 
If they haven’t attacked the earth 
in the past billion years or so, they 
aren’t likely to start very soon. They 
aren’t adapted for atmosphere, or 
for direct, strong sunlight. Only a 
few of the strongest ventured in be- 
yond Orbit Pluto to be sighted, be- 
fore our expedition. None was ever 
seen in closer than Orbit Saturn — 
and that one, I think, was dying.” 
Ryeland was puzzled. “But — 
you spoke of danger.” 

“The danger that lurks in the 
Reefs of Space, yes!” 

“But, if it isn’t the pyropods, then 
what is it?” 

“Freedom!” snapped Colonel Les- 
cure, and clamped his lips shut. 

V 

F aith carried Ryeland off to 
his next interview. “You liked 
Colonel Lescure, didn’t you?” she 
chattered. “He’s such a nice man. 
If it were up to him, the reefrat 
wouldn’t be suffering — ” She 
stopped, the very picture of em- 
barrassed confusion. 

Ryeland looked at her thought- 
fully “What’s a reefrat?” 

“Here’s Major Chatterji’s office,” 
44 



said Faith nervously, and almost 
pushed him through the door. 

Machine Major Chatterji got up, 
smiling blankly through his gleaming 
glasses, waving a copy of Ryeland’s 
orders from the Machine. “Ready, 
Ryeland,” he called. “We’re all set 
for you now.” 

Ryeland advanced into the room, 
thinking. “I’ll need my computer,” 
he said. “And someone to look up all 
the work that’s been done on the 
Hoyle Effect, boil it down, give me 
the essential information.” 

“Right! You can have three as- 
sistants from Colonel Lescure’s sec- 
tion. And I’ve already requisitioned 
a binary computer.” 

“No,” said Ryeland impatiently, 
“not a binary computer. My com- 
puter. Oddball Oporto.” 

Major Chatterji’s gold-rimmed 
glasses twinkled with alarm. “The 
Risk? But Ryeland, really!” 

“I need him,” said Ryeland ob- 
stinately. The Machine’s orders had 
been perfectly clear. 

Chatterji surrendered. “We’ll have 
to get General Fleemer’s okay,” he 
said. “Come along.” He led Ryeland 
out through a short corridor to an 
elevator; Faith tagged after incon- 
spicuously. The three of them went 
up, out, down another hall. Chatter- 
ji tapped on a door. 

“All right,” grumbled a voice from 
a speaker over the door, and it 
swung open. They walked into a 
silver room, with silver walls and 
furnishings plated in silver. General 
Fleemer, in a silver robe that he 
was knotting about him, stumped 
in from a bedroom. “Well?” 

Machine Major Chatterji cleared 

IF 




his throat. "Sir, Ryeland wants the 
other Risk, Oporto, assigned to him.” 
"For calculation purposes, Gen- 
eral,” Ryeland cut in. "He’s a natural 
calculator. What they used to call 
an idiot-savant , or the next thing to 
it.” 

The general looked at him through 
his deepset eyes. "Will that help you 
solve the jetless drive?” 

“Why,” Ryeland began, "I haven’t 
started on that yet. This is the 
Hoyle Effect. The Machine order- 
ed — ” 

"I know what the Machine or- 
dered,” the general grumbled. He 
scratched his nose reflectively. "All 
right, give him his man. But Rye- 
land. The important part of your 
work is the jetless drive.” 

Ryeland was startled. "General, 
the Machine’s orders didn’t give 
priority to either section.” 

"7 give priority,” said the general 
sharply. “Get along with it, man! 
And get out.” 

In the corridor, Chatterji vanish- 
ed toward his office and the To- 
getherness Girl took over again. "A 
very fine man, the general, don’t 
you agree?” she chatted, leading 
him back to the elevator. 

Ryeland took a deep breath. 
"Faith,” ,he said, "there’s something 
funny here. General Fleemer lives 
awfully well! And he seems to take 
it upon himself to, at least, interpret 
the Machine’s orders. Is that custo- 
mary, in Team Attack?” 

The Togetherness Girl hesitated. 
She glanced at Ryeland, then led 
him down the corridor without 
speaking for a moment. She stopped 
before another door. "General 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



Fleemer,” she said, "is a fine man. 
I knew you’d like him. And you’ll 
like Colonel Gottling too, don’t 
think you won’t!” And without any 
more of an answer than that, she 
opened the door to Gotti ing’s office 
for him and left him there. 

B ut Colonel Gottling proved him- 
self very hard to like. 

He was a huge man with a face 
like a skull, the horned helmet over 
it. He stood fingering the controls 
of his radar-horns angrily as Rye- 
land reported in on the teletype. 
"Hurry up, man,” he muttered, and 
clumped out of his office, motion- 
ing Ryeland ahead of him. "You’re 
next,” he snapped. "Lescure had his 
whacks at the creature and he fail- 
ed. They wouldn’t let me handle it 
the way I wanted! And now it’s up 
to you.” 

Ryeland said, "I don’t under- 
stand. What creature?” 

"The spaceling! The reefrat! The 
creature with the jetless drive.” 
Ryeland said humbly, "Colonel, I 
don’t know what you’re talking 
about.” 

Gottling spread his bony hands 
and stared at the ceiling in exaspera- 
tion. "What under the Plan is this? 
What kind of idiots do they salvage 
for top-priority Teams these days? 
Do you mean you never heard of 
the reefrats?” 

"Only the word,” Ryeland ad- 
mitted. "But didn’t you just say 
‘spaceling’?” 

"Same thing!” Gottling stopped in 
an anteroom, jerking a thumb at a 
file cabinet. He barked: "Here! 
Here’s everything you want to know 




about them. Everything from rest- 
ing weight to the chemistry of what 
passes for blood. The only thing I 
can’t tell you is what makes them 
go, and I could tell you that if they’d 
let me alone with the thing!” 

“But — ” 

“You fool, stop saying ‘but’!” 
howled Colonel Gottling. “Look 
here!” 

He opened a door. Beyond was a 
big room, once a repair shop at- 
tached to one of the rocket pits, 
now hastily improvised into a labo- 
ratory. There were unpainted parti- 
tions, unconcealed electric wiring. 
Chemical lab benches held glass- 
ware and flasks of reagents, reeking 
acidly. There were transformers; an 
X-ray generator; various bulky de- 
vices that might have been centri- 
fuges, biological research equip- 
ment — heaven knew what. 

And the lab was busy. 

There were at least two dozen 
men and women in scarlet Techni- 
corps smocks working at the 
benches and instruments. They 
glanced up only briefly as Colonel 
Gottling and Ryeland entered and 
checked in, then quickly went back 
to their work without speaking. 

Evidently the cheery good will 
among the brass didn't extend to the 
lower echelons. 

Colonel Gottling, in a good hu- 
mor again, lighted a long, green- 
tinted cigarette and waved at the 
room “It’s all yours now,” he 
grunted. “Temporarily.” 

Ryeland looked at him. 

“Or permanently,” grinned the 
colonel, “provided vou can tell us 
what makes the spaceling fly. Me, 
46 



I think you can’t. You look soft, 
Ryeland. The collar has not hard- 
ened you enough. Still — Do you 
want me to tell you something 
about the spaceling?” 

“I certainly do,” Ryeland said 
fervently. 

“All right, why not? It’s fairly in- 
telligent. Lower primate level, at 
least. It is a warm-blooded oxygen- 
breathing mammal which — why 
do you look that way, man?” 
Ryeland closed his mouth. “It’s 
just that I thought it lived in space.” 
Colonel Gottling guffawed. “And 
it does! An oxygen-breather, living 
in open space! Amusing, is it not? 
But it possesses some remarkable 
adaptations.” 

“Such as what?” 

Colonel Gottling looked bored. 
“You should have asked Lescure 
these questions. I am a rocket man! 
But first, of course, there is the jet- 
less drive. Then there is something 
else — a field of force, perhaps, 
which enables it to hold a little 
cloud of air around it, even out in 
interstellar vacuum.” 

Ryeland said thoughtfully: “Could 
the two effects be linked?” 

“Could they? Of course they 
could, idiot! But are they? I do not 
know.” But Gottling was mellow- 
ing; treating Ryeland like an idiot 
had put him in a good humor. He 
said condescendingly: “It is possible, 
of course. I have thought that my- 
self. If the reefrat can accelerate 
its own body without reaction, per- 
haps it can also accelerate gas 
molecules centripetally, also without 
reaction. How can one know? But — 
“But let us look at the spaceling,” 

IF 




he said abruptly. “Then we can talk 
more better.” 

H e led the way through the 
laboratory and out the other 

side. 

They went througn a steel door 
into a sort of airlock. Racks in the 
walls held bulky protective suits and 
red-painted emergency gear. A 
warning sign glowed on the inner 
door of the airlock: 

DANGER! 

LANDING PIT — WAIT 
FOR DECONTAMINATION 

“It is safe,” Gottling assured him. 
“The pit was deconned months ago, 
before the spaceling was brought 
in.” 

He pulled a lever. Motors groan- 
ed; the inner door, an enormous 
lead-lined mass of steel and fire- 
brick, inched slowly aside. 

Like a Viking in his radar horns, 
the colonel stalked into the landing 
pit, Ryeland following. 

The pit was an enormous circular 
cavern. Floodlights blazed on the 
blackened concrete floor. Even the 
decon crews, with all their foamants 
and air-blasting, had failed to re- 
move the black breath of the jets. 

Ryeland recognized it at once. It 
was the pit of which he had caught 
a glimpse the night before, with the 
Togetherness Girl. He lifted his eyes, 
looking for the sky and a settling 
rocket instinctively; but the dark 
armored walls lifted up into shad- 
owy mystery. The cranes and the 
stages above were dark shapes in 
the dimness. No light passed the 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



enormous doors, hundreds of feet 
up, that closed off the sky. 

Gottling touched his arm and 
pointed. 

Out in the black concrete stood 
a room-sized cage. Inside the cage 
was a pale cloud of greenish light; 
and in the center of the cloud lying 
motionless on the bare steel floor — 

“The spaceling,” said Gottling 
proudly. 

It had struggled. 

At close range, Ryeland could 
see how frantically fierce that strug- 
gle had been. The steel bars of the 
cage were thicker than his wrist, 
but some of them were bent. Red 
blood smeared them, and matted the 
spaceling’s golden fur. It lay gasp- 
ing on the stainless steel floor. 

“She’s skulking now, but we’ll put 
her through her paces,” Gottling 
bragged. 

Ryeland said: “Wait, Colonel! 

The thing’s injured. In the name of 
heaven, you can’t — ” 

“Can’t?” blazed the colonel. 
“Can't?” His finger reached up and 
touched the buttons of his radar- 
field suggestively. Under the trig- 
gering radar horns, his skull-like face 
glowered. “Don’t tell me what I 
can’t do, fool! Do you want me to 
expand my field radius? One touch 
of this and there won’t be enough 
of you left to salvage!” 

Ryeland swallowed. Involuntarily 
his hand reached toward the col- 
lar, with its eighty grams of high 
explosive. 

“That’s better,” grunted Gottling. 
He clapped his hands and called: 
“Sergeant, get busy! Goose her!” 

A Technicorps sergeant in red 

47 




came trotting out of the shadows. 
He carried a long pole tipped with 
a sharpened blade. Black wires led 
from it to a battery box on his 
shoulder. 

The spaceling rolled its battered 
head. 

Its eyes opened — large, dark, 
limpid eyes — a seal’s eyes; and 
they were terrible, it seemed to Rye- 
land, with suffering and fear. A 
shudder rippled along the creature’s 
smooth, featureless flanks. 

“Goose her in the belly!” Gottling 
shouted. “Mr. Ryeland wants to see 
her do her tricks!” 

The spaceling screamed. 

Its cry was thinly edged with 
terror, like the voice of a hysterical 
woman. “Stop it,” Ryeland gasped, 
shaken. 

Colonel Gottling blared with 
laughter. Tears rolled out of his 
piglike eyes, down the bony cheeks. 
Finally he got control of himself. 
“Why, certainly,” he gasped. 
“You’re next, as I said, eh? And if 
you believe you can tell us how the 
creature flies without even seeing her 
do it — ” he shrugged. 

Writhing on the floor of the cage 
as though it had already felt the 
prod, the spaceling screamed in 
fright again. 

Ryeland said hoarsely: “Just make 
him take that prod away.” 

“As you wish,” the colonel nodded 
urbanely. “Sergeant! Return to duty. 
And -you, Ryeland, I will leave you 
alone with your friend. Perhaps if 
I am not here to eavesdrop, she 
will whisper her secret in your ear!” 
Bellowing with laughter, Colonel 
Gottling shambled out of the pit. 
48 



A fter an hour, Ryeland began 
to appreciate the difficulties of 
the problem. 

Back in the file room, he found 
a summary of the existing knowl- 
edge of the spaceling; he took it to 
the landing pit and read through it, 
watching the spaceling, trying to al- 
low it to become accustomed to his 
presence. The creature hardly 
moved, except to follow Ryeland 
with its eyes. 

The notes on the spaceling show- 
ed a fruitless and painful history. 
The spaceling had been captured by 
an exploring Plan rocket retracing 
the steps of Lescure’s Cristobal 
Colon. A section of notes, showing 
how the capture had been effected, 
was missing; the account took up 
the story with the creature being 
brought into the hastily converted 
rocket pit. It had been chained at 
first, so that the first investigators 
approached it with impunity. Then 
the chains had been taken off — 
and, in quick order, half a dozen 
investigators had been bashed rather 
severely against the bars. The space- 
ling did not seem to have attacked 
them; they simply were in the way 
of the thing’s terrified attempts at 
escape. However, after that the ob- 
servations had been conducted pri- 
marily from outside the cage. And 
mostly — at least in the last two 
weeks, since Colonel Gottling had 
taken over charge of the specimen 
— with the help of the goad. Or 
worse. 

There were reports of blood tests 
and tissue samples. Ryeland glanced 
at them, frowned and put them 
aside; they meant nothing to him. 

IF 





49 




There were X-ray studies, and 
reams of learned radiologists’ re- 
ports. Also of no value to Ryeland, 
whatever they might have meant to 
Colonel Pascal Lescure. 

Then there were physical tests. 
Dynamometers had measured the 
pull against the chains. Telemeter- 
ing devices had registered the 

change in the recorded curves of its 
vital processes under various condi- 
tions — at rest, as it “flew”, and 
“under extraordinary stimulus,” as 
the report primly put it. Meaning, 
Ryeland supposed, under torture. 

No radiation of any sort had been 
detected. And someone had thought 
to surround the creature with 

plumb-bobs to test for an incident 
side thrust; there was none; the 

plumbs were undisturbed. 

No thrust! 

Then this nonsense that everyone 
had been spouting so glibly was not 
nonsense after all! 

For if there was no measurable 
thrust against its environment to 

balance its measured dynamometer 
pull — then the spaceling had, in- 
deed, a true jetless drive. 

Ryeland looked up from the notes 
to stare at the spaceling, slumped 
in the bottom of its cage, its great 
eyes fixed on him. Jetless drive! 

He suddenly felt very small and, 
for all the Togetherness and the 
Teamwork, . for all the joint effort 
embodied in the Plan of Man, very 
alone. Jetless drive — here in this 
creature lay the seeds of a fact 
which would destroy Newton’s Third 
Law, change the shape of the Solar 
System. For unquestionably, with 
such a drive, the scope of the Plan 
50 



of Man would widen beyond recog- 
nition. Out past the useless, frozen 
methane giants, the Plan would 
drive to the stars! 

Ryeland shook his head, confused 
For suddenly he didn’t want the 
Plan of Man expanded to the stars. 
That word that Pascal Lescure had 
used — “Freedom!” 

It did not seem to live under the 
Plan. 

A bruptly his reveries were ended; 

there was a rumble like thun- 
der in the pit. 

Ryeland leaped to his feet, aston- 
ished, while the spaceling mewed 
worriedly in its cage. A blade of 
light split the dark above. He looked 
up, and a slit of blue sky widened. 

There was a confused clattering 
behind him and someone came run- 
ning into the pit. The Technicorps 
sergeant, shouting: “Mr. Ryeland, 
Mr. Ryeland! Get out of the way. 
Some crazy fool is coming in for 
a landing!” 

The sergeant raced over to the 
cage and began frantically trying to 
unbolt its heavy fastenings, to push 
it on its tiny wheel to the side of 
the pit. There was a wild cataract 
of flame thrusting into the opening 
gates of the pit overhead, radio- 
triggered; and a tiny rocket came 
weaving in, settling on a cushion of 
bright white fire. 

Ryeland thought grimly: “Thank 
God it’s only a little one!” A big one 
would have been the end of the 
spaceling — and of himself and the 
Technicorps sergeant as well. But 
this little speedster had plenty of 
room to land without incinerating 

i* 




them all. It was a one-man craft, 
built for looks and play; it dropped 
to the black concrete on the far side 
of the pit, a hundred yards away, 
and though heat washed over them 
like a benediction, it did them no 
harm. A sudden gale roared through 
the floor ducts, sweeping the rocket 
fumes away. 

A ramp fell. 

A slim figure in white coveralls 
ran lightly down the ramp and 
across the concrete, confusingly 
half-familiar birds fluttering about 
its head. 

Ryeland was galvanized into ac- 
tion. “Stop it!” he shouted. “Keep 
away from that cage!” 

The intruder ignored him. Swear- 
ing, Ryeland raced to intercept the 
stranger. He took a dozen angry 
strides, caught a slim arm, swung 
the intruder around — and gasped. 
Silvery doves tore fiercely at his 
face and head. 

“Get your hands off me, Risk!” 
It was a girl — that girl! He could 
see now that her white coveralls 
did not disguise her sex. Her eyes 
were a greenish blue, and very fa- 
miliar eyes; her voice, though 
charged with indignation, was a fa- 
miliar voice. 

She gestured, and the Peace 
Doves fluttered muttering away. 
“What do you mean?” she demand- 
ed, shaking his fingers off her arm. 

Ryeland gulped. It was the Plan- 
ner’s daughter, Donna Creery. “I — ” 
he began. “I — I didn’t know it 
was you! But what do you want 
here?” 

“Want?” The ocean-water eyes 
flashed. “I want to know what you 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



people are doing — what you think 
you’re doing by torturing my space- 
ling!” 

VI 

T he girl stood staring at Rye- 
land. She was an entirely dif- 
ferent creature from the lovely girl 
in the bubble bath, almost* unrecog- 
nizable. The Donna of the Planner’s 
private subtrain car was a teen-ager 
in the process of becoming woman, 
with the sad shyness of youth and 
its innocence. But this girl was some- 
thing else. This was the Planner’s 
daughter, imperious. And not a 
child. 

Ryeland took a deep breath. Plan- 
ner’s daughter or no, this girl was 
in his way. The only way he had of 
getting the collar off his neck lay 
through the creature in the cage. 
He said sharply: “Get out of here, 
Miss Creery. The spaceling is dying. 
It mustn’t be disturbed.” 

“What?” The Peace Dove, set- 
tling on her shoulders, whirred and 
muttered. 

“You aren’t allowed here,” he said 
stubbornly. “Please leave!” 

She stared at him incredulously; 
then, without a word, turned to the 
cage. “Here, sweet,” she whispered to 
the great seal-like animal. “Don’t 
worry. Donna’s here.” The spaceling 
lifted its head and stared at her with 
great, limpid eyes. 

Ryeland said harshly: “Miss 

Creery, I asked you to leave.” 

She didn’t bother to look at him. 
“There’s a good girl,” she cooed, 
like a child with a puppy. “Where’s 
the damned door?” 



51 




Ryeland was angry now. "You 
can’t go in there!” He caught at her 
arm. It was like catching a tiger by 
the tail; there was a quick move- 
ment, too fast to follow, and she 
caught him a stinging blow across 
the face with her open hand. Sheer 
astonishment drove him back; and 
by the time he recovered his balance 
the Planner’s daughter had found 
the catch and was inside the door 
of the cage. 

The spaceling came heaving seal- 
like toward her, whimpering. 

I t was a bad spot for Ryeland. 

If anything happened to the 
girl, there was no doubt in the 
world that he would be held respon- 
sible. Gottling would see to that. 
And then good-by dreams of free- 
dom. 

In fact, more likely it would be 
goodbye head! 

Ryeland swore angrily. The Peace 
Doves squawked and rose into the 
air, circling around him. He paused, 
searched around, found a length of 
heavy chain just outside the cage 
door. Heaven knew what it had 
been used for — though the stains 
on it suggested one possibility. He 
caught it up and dove into the cage 
after the girl. 

"Stop,” she said calmly. “I don’t 
want to turn the Doves loose on 
you.” 

“Then get out of here!” he de- 
manded. The floor of the cage was 
slippery with a kind of odorous 
slime. Part of it was the spaceling’s 
blood, undoubtedly, but there was 
more — decaying small things that 
Rveland couldn’t recognize; perhaps 
52 



they were animals that had come 
with the spaceling. The stench was 
powerful and sickening, but Rye- 
land didn’t let it stop him. If that 
girl could stand it, that dainty crea- 
ture who lived in an atmosphere of 
lilac blossoms and ease, certainly 
he could! 

She was bending over the crea- 
ture, reaching down to caress its 
golden fur. "Drop that chain.” she 
ordered over her shoulder. "It’s 
afraid of you.” 

It flinched from her touch at 
first. Then it relaxed. It licked at 
her face with a long black tongue. 
A sudden rumble filled the cage, 
like the purr of a giant cat. 

There was an eruption of noise 
from outside. Colonel Gottling, ra- 
dar-horned, deep eyes blazing fury 
out of the face like a skull, came 
racing in with a dozen men in Tech- 
nicorps scarlet. "Get her out of 
there, you fool!” he roared, waving 
the electric prod at Ryeland. 

The spaceling saw him and the 
enormous purr stopped. The crea- 
ture began to whimper and tremble. 
"Hold it!” cried Ryeland. "You’re 
frightening the spaceling. It may at- 
tack Miss Creery!” 

But Donna Creery needed no help 
from him just then. On her knees 
in the bloody slime, she looked up 
from the torn, blood-crusted fur of 
the creature and her eyes were a 
hawk’s eyes. "Colonel Gottling,” she 
said in a thin voice that cut like 
knives. "I’ve been wanting to talk 
to you!” 

The skull faced colonel swallow- 
ed but stood his ground. "You must 
get out of there, Miss Creery! The 

IF 




annual is dangerous. It has already 
wounded half a dozen men!” 

“And what were the men doing 
to the spaceling?” The girl bent to 
pat the golden battered head. Two 
or three fat green flies were buzz- 
ing through the thinning cloud of 
light around the wounds on the 
spaceling’s flanks. “Filthy,” she said 
with scorn. “I want this cleaned up!” 
She stood up and gestured Rye- 
land ahead of her out of the cage. 
“I want a meeting of the whole 
Team,” she said coldly, closing the 
cage door behind her, “and I want 
it now! Meanwhile, Gottling, have 
your men clean that cage out. And 
if I catch any of them using that 
prod again, I’ll see how they like it 
used on themselves!” 

Gottling turned purple. In a 
voice stiff with self-control he said: 
“It is no longer my project, Miss 
Creery. Mr. Ryeland has taken it 
over.” 

“I give it back,” said the girl. “I 
have another use for Mr. Ryeland.” 
Ryeland said, shocked: “But the 
Machine ordered — ” 

“I’ll take care of the Machine,” 
she said calmly. “Get started on this 
cage, you men! The spaceling needs 
her symbiotic partners and they’re 
dying fast.” She turned to the door. 
“Now let’s have that meeting,” she 
said grimly. “I want to get a few 
things straight!” 

T hey were back at Point Cres- 
cent Green. The Team was 
buzzing like flies around the space- 
ling’s wounds. 

Donna Creery dominated the 
meeting. Major Chatterji tittered 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



shyly and General Fleemer made 
half a dozen speeches on Teamwork; 
Colonel Gottling was in an icy rage 
and Colonel Lescure fluttered ob- 
jections. But not one of them could 
stand up against the girl. 

She blazed: “If that animal dies, 
she’s going to take the lot of you 
with her! I’ve got news for you. 
There’s a shortage of salvage ma- 
terial at the Body Bank.” She stared 
around the room appraisingly. 
“Some of you would make pretty 
good spare parts. Do I make myself 
clear?” 

“Quite clear,” Genral Fleemer 
said humbly. “But, Miss Creery, our 
Team objective — ” 

“Shut up,” she said mildly. “Yes? 
What is it?” 

Machine Major Chatterji said 
with great respect: “There’s a mes- 
sage for you on the teletype.” 

“It can wait.” There was an au- 
dible gasp but the girl paid no at- 
tention. “From this date forward, 
Mr. Ryeland is in charge of the 
Team.” 

General Fleemer choked and 
sputtered: “Miss Creery, a Risk 
can’t be put — ” 

“Yes, a Risk can,” Donna Creery 
contradicted. “Oh, all right. Here, 
I’ll get orders for you.” She walked 
through them to the teletype, calm- 
ly pressed the “Interrupt” switch — 
another gasp swept through the 
Team — and began to type. In a 
moment the Machine’s answer rat- 
tled back: 

Action. Fleemer Team will 
comply with directive of Don- 
na Creery 

IS 




"Anything else bothering you?” 
she demanded. 

“Nothing,” croaked General 
Fleemer. His toad eyes bulged more 
than ever. 

“All right. Now the rest of you 
clear out. Ryeland, I want to talk 
to you.” 

Whispering among themselves, 
but not audibly, the Team filed out 
of the conference room. Donna 
Creery stretched and yawned, the 
Peace Doves fluttering and cooing. 
“That’s better,” she said drowsily. 
“What are you doing?” 

Ryeland coughed. “There seems to 
be a message coming in for you, 
Miss Creery,” he said. 

“There always is,” she sighed. She 
stood behind him, one arm casually 
on his shoulder, reading: 

Information. Planner Creery 
en route from Mombasa to Cape- 
town. Information. Donna Cree- 
ry personal rocket refueled and 
serviced Information. London 
Philharmonic acknowledges re- 
ceipt of opening season program 
instructions. Action. Request 
choice of soloist Beethoven pi- 
ano concerto. Information. Moon 
colony Alpha-Six requests pres- 
ence Donna Creery 25th anni- 
versary celebration. Informa- 
tion. 

“The usual run of thing,” the girl 
said absently. “It can wait.” She 
looked around. “This place depresses 
me. Haven’t you got a room of your 
own? Let’s go there.” She didn’t wait 
for an answer; she got up and 
beckoned Ryeland to follow. 

He was not surprised to find that 



she knew the way. There seemed to 
be very little this girl didn’t know! 

B ut the situation was getting 
out of hand. 

This girl was giving orders to an 
entire Research Team. It wasn’t her 
place to do that. Everybody knew 
that! Under the Plan of Man it was 
the Machine that gave orders. Hu- 
man beings — even Planner’s daugh- 
ters — were supposed to do their 
own job (perfectly) , and nobody 
else’s. That was plain logic, the logic 
of the Plan. 

He stood stiffly holding the door 
to his room, meditating what to say 
to her. She walked in, looking curi- 
ously about; he followed, leaving 
the door ajar. 

“Oh, close it,” she said impatient- 
ly. “Don’t you think my Peace 
Doves are chaperones enough?” She 
laughed at the expression on his 
face, threw herself at full length on 
his bed and lit a cigarette. The dis- 
lodged Peace Doves cooed com- 
plainincly and found roosts for 
themselves on the iron headboard. 

Grudgingly * Ryeland closed the 
door. He nodded to the teletype. 
“Don’t you want to check in?” 
“The Machine’ll find me,” Donna 
Creery said cheerfully. “You watch.” 
And, sure enough, the words were 
hardly out of her mouth when the 
keys beean to rattle away:

ning Council asks Donna Creery

IF 




“Someone’s always available to 
tell the Machine where I’ve gone,” 
the girl told Ryeland seriously. “And 
if not — well, the Machine can 
usually make a pretty good guess 
where I’ll bo. It knows me pretty 
well by now.” 

She spoke, Ryeland noticed won- 
deringly, as though the Machine 
were an old friend. But she didn’t 
give him much chance to speculate 
on that; she said abruptly: “You’re 
not much, Steve, but you’re better 
than those others. Can you keep my 
spaceling alive?” 

“Your spaceling?” 

She laughed. “It’s mine because 
I like it. Everything I like belongs 
to me — that’s the way I want it.” 
She added seriously: “But I don’t 
know yet whether or not I like you.” 
He said, the back of his neck 
bristling, “I have my duty, Miss 
Creery. I’m going to do it! I hope 
it won’t mean any further discom- 
fort to the spaceling, but, if it does 
— Do you see this?” He tugged 
angrily at his collar. “I want that 
off! If I have to kill a million space- 
lings to get it off, I’ll do it!” 

She stubbed out her cigarette 
lazily. “That isn’t what you told 
Gottling,” she observed. 

“How do you know what I told 
Gottling?” 

“Oh, I know very many things. 
Why shouldn’t I? The Machine goes 
everywhere, and my father is prac- 
tically part of the Machine. And, 
oh, yes, I like the Machine, and 
everything I like — ” She shrugged 
winsomely. 

Ryeland stared. She was mocking 
him. She had to be. It was a joke in 
THE REEFS OF SPACE 



terribly bad taste, but surely that 
was all it was. He said stiffly: “Miss 
Creery, I don’t appreciate that sort 
of remark about the Machine. I 
believe in the Plan of Man.” 

“That’s terribly good of you,” she 
said admiringly. 

“Blast you,” he yelled, pushed a 
step too far, “don’t make fun of 
me! The Plan of Man needs the jet- 
less drive, you silly little skirt! If the 
spaceling has to die so the Plan can 
discover its secret, what possible dif- 
ference does that make?” 

She swung her feet to the ground 
and got up, walking over close to 
him. Her face was relaxed and 
sympathetic. She looked at him for 
a second. 

Then she said suddenly: “Do you 
still love that girl?” 

It caught him off balance. “What 
— what girl?” 

“Angela Zwick,” she said patient- 
ly. “The daughter of Stefan Zwick. 
The blonde, twenty years old, five 
feet four and a quarter, with green 
eyes, who became your teletype op- 
erator late one afternoon and made 
you kiss her that very night. The one 
who turned you in. Do you still love 
her?” 

Ryeland’s eyes popped. “I — I 
know you’ve got special sources of 
information,” he managed, “but, 
really, I had no idea — ” 

“Answer the question,” she said 
impatiently. 

He took a deep breath and con- 
sidered. 

“Why, I don’t know,” he said at 
last. “Perhaps I do.” 

Donna Creery nodded. “I thought 
so,” she said. “All right, Steve. I 

55 




thought for a moment — But, no, 
It wouldn’t work out, would it? But 
I admire your spirit.” 

Ryeland took a deep breath again. 
This girl, she had a talent for con- 
fusing him. It wasn’t possible for 
him to keep up with her, he decided, 
it was only possible for him to cling 
to the basic facts of his existence. 
He said stiffly: “It doesn’t take spirit 
to defend the Plan of Man. If the 
Plan needs to learn the secret of 
the jetless drive, that's my plain 
duty.” 

She nodded and sat again on his 
bed, the Peace Doves settling gently 
on her shoulders. “Tell me, Steve, 
do you know why the Plan of Man 
requires this information?” 

“Why — no, not exactly. I sup- 
pose — ” 

“Don’t suppose. It’s to explore 
the reefs of space. Do you know 
what the Plan wants in the reefs?” 
“No, I can’t say that — ” 

“It wants Ron Donderevo, Steve.” 



“Ron?” He frowned. 

“The man who got out of his iron 
collar, Steve,” the girl said, nodding. 
“A man you might like to know 
again. That booby-trapped, tamper- 
proof collar, that nobody can pos- 
sibly get off until the Machine au- 
thorizes it — the Machine wants to 
talk to Donderevo about it, very 
badly. Because he took his collar 
off, all by himself.” 

Ryeland stared at her. 

She nodded. “And Donderevo is 
out in the reefs now,” she Said, “and 
the Machine wants to do something 
about it. It might simply destroy the 
reefs. I understand you are working 
on some such project. But if it can't 
do that, it wants to send someone 
out there to find him. 

“Someone with a radar gun, 
Steve! To kill him! And that’s why 
the Machine wants the secret of the 
jetless drive!”

IF • Short Story 



THE 

FACES OUTSIDE 

by bruce McAllister 



They were all that was 
left of humanity — if 
they were still human! 



I wanted to call her Soft Breast, 
because she is soft when I 
hold her to me. But the Voice told 
me to call her Diane. When I call 
her Diane, I have a pleasant feel- 
ing, and she seems closer to me. She 
likes the name “Diane”. The Voice 
knew what was best, of course, as it 
always does. 

I must mate with her every day, 
when the water is brightest. The 
Voice says so. It also says that I am 
in a “tank”, and that the water is 
brightest when the “sun” is over the 
“tank”. I do not understand the 
meaning of “sun”, but the Voice says 

THE FACES OUTSIDE 



that “noon” is when the “Sun” is 
over the “tank”. I must mate with 
Diane every “noon”. 

I do know what the “tank” is. It 
is a very large thing filled with wa- 
ter, and having four “corners”, one 
of which is the Cave where Diane 
and I sleep when the water is black 
like the ink of the squid and cold 
like dead fish. But we stay warm. 
There is the “floor” of the “tank”, 
the “floor” being where all the rock 
and seaweed is, with all the crawl- 
ing fish and crabs, where Diane and 
I walk and sleep. There are four 
“sides”. “Sides” are smooth and blue 



57 



walls, and have “view-ports” — 
round, transparent areas — on them. 
The Voice says that the things in the 
“view-ports” are Faces. I have a 
face, as does Diane. But the crack- 
ed, flat things with small lights cir- 
cling about them are not pretty like 
Diane’s face. The Voice says that 
the Faces have bodies, like myself, 
and Diane. No body could be like 
Diane’s. I think I should be quite 
sick if I saw the bodies of the Faces. 

The Voice then says that the 
Faces are watching us, as we some- 
times watch the porpoises. It took 
a very long time to grow used to 
having the Faces watch us, as Di- 
ane and I came together, but we 
learned to do it as simply as we 
swim and sleep. 

But Diane does not have babies. 
I am very sad when I see the por- 
poises and whales with their young. 
Diane and I sleep together in the 
Cave; Diane is very warm and soft. 
We sleep in happiness, but when we 
are awake, we are lonely. I ques- 
tion the Voice about a baby for Di- 
ane, but the Voice is always silent. 

I grow to hate the Faces in the 
“view-ports”. They are always watch- 
ing, watching. The Voice says that 
they are enemies, and bad. The Faces 
have not tried to hurt me: but 
I must think of them as enemies be- 
cause the Voice says so. I ask bad, 
like the shark? The Voice says, no, 
worse than the sharks and eels. It 
says that the Faces are evil. 

The “tank” must be high, because 
the water is high. I have gone once 
to the surface, and, although I 
could get used to it, the light was 
too much for my eyes. It took me 
58 



two hundred and seventy kicks to 
the surface; it took me three thou- 
sand steps from our Cave to the op- 
posite “side”. The “tank” is very 
large, otherwise the whales would 
not be happy. 

The fish are many, but the dan- 
gers are few. I have seen the sharks 
kill. But the shark does not come 
near me if I see it and am afraid. 
Sometimes I have caught it sneak- 
ing up behind me, but when I turn 
it leaves quickly. I have questioned 
the Voice about why the sharks 
leave. It does not know. It has no 
one to ask. 

T oday the “sun” must be very 
large, or powerful, or bright, 
because the water is brighter than 
most days. 

When I awoke Diane was not be- 
side me. The rock of the Cave is 
jagged, so as I make my way from 
our bed of cool and slick seaweed, 
toward the entrance, I scrape my 
leg on the fifth kick. Not much 
blood comes from the cut. That is 
fortunate, because when there is 
blood the sharks come. 

Diane has grabbed the tail of a 
porpoise, and both are playing. Di- 
ane and I love the porpoises. Some- 
times we can even hear their 
thoughts. They are different from 
the other fish; they are more like 
us. But they have babies and we 
do not. 

Diane sees me and, wanting to 
play, swims behind a rock and looks 
back, beckoning. I make a grab at 
her as I sneak around the rock. But 
she darts upward, toward the sur- 
face, where her body is a shadow of 

IF 




beauty against the lighter water 
above her. I follow her, but she 
ducks and I sail past her. Diane 
pulls up her legs, knees under her 
chin, and puts her arms around 
them. She then drops like a rock 
toward the “floor”. 

I have caught a porpoise by his 
top fin. He knows my wish, so he 
speeds toward Diane, circles her 
and butts her soft thighs with his 
snout. She laughs, but continues to 
stay in a ball, her black hair wav- 
ing. She is very beautiful. 

I try to pry her arms from around 
her legs gently, but she resists. I 
must use force. Diane does not 
mind when I do; because she knows 
I love her. 

I pull her arms away, and slip 
my arms under hers, kissing her on 
the lips for a long time. Struggling to 
free herself, laughing again, she 
pokes me sharply with her elbow 
and escapes my arms. I am sur- 
prised. She quickly puts her arms 
around my neck, pulls herself to my 
back and links her slim legs around 
my middle. She is pretending that 
I am a porpoise. I laugh. She pinch- 
es me to go ahead. I swim upward, 
but her thoughts tell me she wants 
to go to the Cave. 

I understand. I carry her through 
the water very slowly, feeling the 
warmth and nipples of her breasts 
pressed against my back as she rests 
her head on my shoulder and 
smiles. 

The Faces continue to stare. 
Many times I have searched for a 
word to show my hatred for them. 
I shall find it somehow, though. 
Sooner or later. 



C4TX7Tiat count of planets had 
* * the Terrans infested?” The 
furry humanoid leaned over the 
desk and stared, unblinking, at the 
lesser humanoid in the only other 
chair in the room. His gaze was 
dropped as he scratched informal- 
ly at the heavy fur at his wrist. He 
raised his gaze again. 

“Forty-three is the count, beush” 
replied the other. 

“And the count of planets de- 
stroyed?” 

“Forty-three planetoid missiles 
were sent and detonated simultane- 
ously without resistance or losses on 
our part, beush” the assistant beush 
answered indirectly. 

The room was hot, so the beush 
lazily passed his hand over a faintly 
glowing panel. 

The room was cooled, and a 
large-eyed female with silky, och- 
rous fur — very desirable to the ma- 
jority of humanoids — entered with 
two flared glasses of an odorles;* 
transparent liquid — very desirable 
to the majority of humanoids. The 
lesser humanoid was being treated 
exceptionately well. 

The room was momentarily si- 
lent as the two sipped at their drinks 
with black lips. The beush , as cus- 
tomary, spoke first. “Inform me of 
the pre-espionage intelligence ac- 
complishments contra - Energi. I 
have not been previously informed. 
Do not spare the details.” 

“Of certainty, beush” began the 
assistant with all the grace of an 
informer. “The Light and Force Re- 
search of the Energi is executed in 
one center of one planet, the planet 
being Energa, as our intelligence 

59 



THE FACES OUTSIDE 




service has conveniently listed it. 
The Energi have negative necessity 
for secrecy in their Light and Force 
Research, because, first, all centers 
are crusted and protected by Force 
Domes. Second, it is near impossi- 
bility that one could so self-disguise 
that he would negatively be detect- 
able.” He hesitated. 

“And these Energi,” queried the 
beush, “are semi-telepathic or em- 
pathic?” 

“Affirmative,” the assistant mum- 
bled. 

“Then you have there a third rea- 
son,” offered the beush. 

“Graces be given you, beush” 

The beush nodded in approval. 
“Continue, but negatively hesitate 
frequently or it will be necessary to 
discuss this subject post-present.” 

H is assistant trembled slightly. 

“Unequivocally affirmative. 
Beush , your memory relates that five 
periods ante-present, when there ex- 
isted the Truce inter Energi, Ter- 
rans and ourselves, there was a cer- 
tain period during which gifts of the 
three nucleus-planets were exchang- 
ed in friendship. The Terrans were 
self-contented to donate to the En- 
ergi an immense ‘aquarium’ — an 
‘aquarium’ consisting of a partly 
transparent cell in which was placed 
a collection of Terran life-forms 
that breathed their oxygen from the 
dense atmosphere of Terran seas. 
But, as a warp-space message from 
the Terran Council indirectly pro- 
claimed, the degenerate Terrans 
negatively possessed a ship of any 
Space type large or powerful 
enough to transport the ‘aquarium* 



to Energa. Our ships being the lar- 
gest of the Truce, we were petition- 
ed by the Terrans to transport it. 
These events developed before the 
Terrans grew pestiferous to our 
cause. We obliged, but even our 
vastest ship was slow, because the 
physical power necessary to bring 
the weight of the cell through warp- 
space quickly was too great for the 
solitary four generators. It was im- 
perative that the trip be on a longer 
trajectory arranged through norm- 
space. During the duration of the 
trip, feelings of suspicion arose in- 
ter Three Truce Races. As your 
memory also relates, the ‘aquar- 
ium* was still in space when we 
found it necessary to obliterate the 
total race of Terrans. The message 
of the annihilation arrived in retard 
to the Energi, so Time permitted 
us to devise a contra-Energi intelli- 
gence plan, a necessity since it was 
realized that the Energi would be 
disturbed by our action contra-Ter- 
rans and would, without doubt, take 
action contra-ourselves. 

“Unknown to you, beush , or to 
the masses and highers, an insignifi- 
cant pleasure craft was extracted 
from Terran Space and negatively 
consumed with a planet when the 
bombs were detonated. The ship ac- 
commodated two Terrans. Proper 
Terrans by birth, negatively by ref- 
erence. One was male, other female. 
The two had been in their culture 
socially and religiously united in a 
ceremony called ‘matrimony*. Emo- 
tions of sex, protection and an emo- 
tion we have negatively been able 
to analyze linked the two, and made 
them ideal for our purpose.”

IF 




The assistant looked at the beush, 
picked up his partially full glass and, 
before he could sip it, was dashed 
to the floor beside the beush him- 
self. The former helped the higher 
to his unstable legs, and was com- 
mented to by the same, “Assistant, 
proceed to the protecroom.” 

They entered the well-illuminated 
closet and immediately slipped into 
the unwieldy metallic suits. Once 
again they took their seats, the 
beush reflecting and saying, “As your 
memory relates, that explosion was 
a bomb-drop concussion from the 
Rebellers. We must now wear anti- 
radiation protection. For that rea- 
son, and the danger of the Energi, 
you do see why we need the for- 
mulae of the Force Domes, immed- 
iately ” 

There was menace in his voice. 
The assistant trembled violently. 
Using the rare smile of that human- 
oid race, the beush continued, “Do 
negatively self-preoccupy. Resume 
your information, if contented.” 

“Contented,” came the automatic 
reply, and the assistant began, “The 
two humans were perfect for the 
Plan, I repeat. Before the Energi 
received the message of the race 
destruction, it was imperative that 
we establish* an agent on Energa, 
near the Force Domes. We assumed 
that the ‘aquarium’ would be placed 
on Energa, in the greatest center. 
That was correct, but negatively yet 
knowing for certainty, we perpetu- 
ated the Plan, with the ‘aquarium’ 
as the basis. 

“One of our most competent pro- 
toplasmic computers stabilized the 
final steps of the Plan. We were to 

THE FACES OUTSIDE 



subject the two Terrans to radiation 
and have as a result two Terrans 
who could breathe their normal ox- 
ygen form H20 — the atmosphere 
of the ‘aquarium’, I repeat. We were 
then to deprive them of memory, 
except of the inter-attracting emo- 
tions, to allow them to live in har- 
mony. Thirdly, we were to place 
them in the ‘aquarium’ and have 
them forwarded under ‘the refer- 
ence of semi-intelligent aqua-beings 
from Terran seas. A simple, but 
quite effective plan, your opinion, 
beushl” 

“Quite,” was the reply. “And con- 
cerning the method of info-inter- 
ception?” 

The assistant continued without 
hesitation, embarrassed by his in- 
competency, “A hyper-complex sphe- 
roid with radio interceptors, a-mat- 
ter viewers and recorders and the 
general intelligence instruments of 
micro-size was placed in the cran- 
ium of the male mutant. The sphe- 
roid has negative direct control over 
the organism. Size was too scarce 
for use on trivialities. Then an ag- 
ent was placed behind the larger 
controls at our end of the instru- 
ments.” 

“And you are the agent?” 

“Hyper-contentedly affirmative.” 

I have done two things today. I 
have found the word for my ha- 
tred of the Faces. The Voice gave 
it to me. When I asked the Voice, 
it laughed and told me the word to 
use was “damn”. So today I have 
thrice said, “Damn the Faces. Damn 
them.” 

Diane and I have decided that we 

61 




want a baby. Maybe the other fish 
wanted them, so they got them. 
We want a baby. 

“The two Terrans were so biolo- 
gically mutated and are so nearly 
robotic, that it is physically impos- 
sible for reproduction on their part, 
beush." 

The beush ignored the assistant’s 
words and said, “I have received 
copies of the thought-patterns and 
translations. There was something 
strange and very powerful about the 
meaning of the male’s thought, 
‘want*. I query.” 

“Be assured without preoccupa- 
tion that there exists negative dan- 
ger of reproduction.” 

The name I wanted to call Di- 
ane was not good, because her 
breasts are hard and large, as is her 
stomach. I think she is sick. 

I do not think Diane is sick. I 
think she is going to have a baby. 

“Entities, assistant! On your oath- 
body you proclaimed that there is 
negative danger of reproduction.” 

“Rest assured, peace, beush. 

“But his thoughts!” 

“Rest assured, higher beush." 

There is much blood in the water 
today. Diane is having a baby; 
sharks have come. I have never seen 
so many sharks, and as big as they 
are T have never seen. T am afraid, 
but still some sneak among us near 
Diane. 

We love the porpoises, so they 
help us now. They are chasing the 



sharks away, injuring and killing 
some. 

“Entities, Warp-spaced Entities! 
There has been reproduction.” 

“ Yorbeush " cried the assistant in 
defense. “It is physically impossible. 
But they are mutants. It is negatively 
impossible that they possess Mind 
Force to a degree.” 

“To what degree? What degree 
could produce reproduction when it 
is physically impossible?” The beush 
was sarcastic. “How far can they 
go?” 

“There is negatively great amount 
they can do. Negative danger, be- 
cause we have studied their in- 
stincts and emotions and found that 
they will not leave the ‘aquarium,’ 
their ‘home’. Unless someone tells 
them to, but there is no one to do 
so.” 

Today I damned the Faces nine 
times and finally wanted them to go 
away. The “view-ports” went black. 
It was like the sharks leaving when 
I wanted them to. I still do not un- 
derstand. 

There has been much useless noise 
and senseless talk from the Voice 
these days. It is annoying because 
I must concentrate on loving Diane 
and caring for the baby. So T want- 
ed the Voice to leave it. It left. 

“Entities Be Simply Damned! The 
spheroid ceased to exist, assistant. 
How far can they go, assistant?” 
The beush rose, screamed hysteri- 
cally for three seconds and then 
fired the hand weapon point blank 
at the neck of his assistant.

IF 




The sharks come today, because 
Diane is having another baby. Diane 
hurts, and there is more blood than 
last time. Her face is not pretty 
when she hurts, as it is pretty when 
she sleeps. So I want her to sleep. 
Her face is pretty now with the 
smile on her lips. 

“Fourteen thousand E n e r g i 
ceased to exist, spheroid ceased to 
exist, and another reproduc- 
tion. Warpspace! How far will they 
go?” 

I t has been hundreds of days. Faces 
keep appearing, but I con- 
tinue to want them to go away. Di- 
ane has had eighteen babies. The 
oldest are swimming around and 
playing with the porpoises. Diane 
and I spend most of the time teach- 
ing the children by showing them 
things, and by giving them our 
thoughts by touching them. 

T k)day I found that none of the 
children have Voices. I could want 
them to have Voices, but the chil- 
dren’s thoughts tell me that it is not 
right to have a Voice. 

The eldest boy says that we 
should leave the tank, that a great- 
er “tank” is around us, and that it 
is easier to move around in that 
greater tank. He also says that we 
must guard ourselves against Faces 
outside. That is strange, but the boy 
is a good boy. Many times he knows 
that things will happen before they 
do. He is a good boy. 

He is almost as tall as I am. The 
eldest girl is pretty like Diane, her 



body very white and soft but, since 
I wanted it so, her hair is golden, 
instead of dark. The boy likes her 
very much, and I have seen them 
together, touching. 

Tomorrow I will explain to him 
that if he wants something, he will 
get it. So he must want a baby. 

“Query? The Energi’ will bomb- 
drop the ‘aquarium’? War declared 
against us? War declared? Entities be 
wholly damned! Negative! Nega- 
tivvv!” The disintegrator was fired 
once more, this time into the orange 
eye of the beush himself, by him- 
self, and for the good of himself. 

When, if I ever do want the 
Voice to come back, it will be very 
surprised to know that Diane has had 
twenty-four babies; that the three 
eldest boys have mated twice, once 
and twice, and have had four ba- 
bies. The Voice will also be sur- 
prised to know that it took all 
twenty-nine of us to want all the 
Faces around the tank to die, as 
the eldest boy said to do. We could 
not tell, but the boy said that six 
million Faces were dead. That 
seems impossible to me, but the boy 
is always right. 

Tomorrow we are leaving the 
the tank. We will want to leave it; 
it is getting crowded. The boy says 
that beyond the greater tank, 
which we will also leave, there is 
enough space for all the babies Di- 
ane could have if she lived forever. 

Forever, he said. It would be 
nice to live forever. I think I’ll 
want . END

Sly, brave and truculent, 
the Qornt held all humans 
in contempt — except one! 



I 

A mbassador Nitworth glowered 
across his mirror-polished, 
nine-foot platinum desk at his as- 
sembled staff. 

“Gentlemen, are any of you fa- 
miliar with a' race known as the 
Qornt?” 

There was a moment of profound 
silence. Nitworth leaned forward, 
looking solemn. 

“They were a warlike race known 
in this sector back in Concordiat 
times, perhaps two hundred years 



ago. They vanished as suddenly as 
they had appeared. There was no 
record of where they went.” He 
paused for effect. 

“They have now reappeared — 
occupying the inner planet of this 
system!” 

“But, sir,” Second Secretary Mag- 
nan offered. “That’s unhabited 
Terrestrial territory ...” 

“Indeed, Mr. Magnan?” Nitworth 
smiled , icily. “It appears the Qornt 
do not share that opinion.” He 
plucked a heavy parchment from a 



64 



IP 



folder before him, harrumphed and 
read aloud: 

His Supreme Excellency The 
Qorn, Regent of Qomt, Over- 
Lord of the Galactic Destiny, 
Greets the Terrestrials and, with 
reference to the presence in 
mandated territory of Terres- 
trial squatters, has the honor to 
advise that he will require the 
use of his outer world on the 
thirtieth day. Then will the 
Qornt come with steel and fire. 
Receive, Terrestrials, renewed as- 
surances of my awareness of 
your existence, and let Those 
who dare gird for the contest. 

“Frankly, I wouldn’t call it con- 
ciliatory,” Magnan said. 

Nitworth tapped the paper with a 
finger. 

“We have been served, gentle- 
men, with nothing less than an Ul- 
timatum!” 

“Well, we’ll soon straighten these 
fellows out — ” the Military At- 
tache began, 

“There happens to be more to 
this piece of truculence than appears 
on the surface,” the Ambassador cut 
in. He paused, waiting for interest- 
ed frowns to settle into place. 

“Note, gentlemen, that these in- 
vaders have appeared on terrestrial 
controlled soil — and without so 
much as a flicker from the instru- 
ments of the Navigational Monitor 
Service!” 

The Military Attache blinked. 
“That’s absurd,” he said flatly. Nit- 
worth slapped the table. 

“We’re up against something new, 



gentlemen! I’ve considered every 
hypothesis from cloaks of invisibil- 
ity to time travel! The fact is — the 
Qornt fleets are indetectible!” 

T he Military Attache pulled at 
his lower lip. “In that case, we 
can’t try conclusions with these fel- 
lows until we have an indetectible 
drive of our own. I recommend a 
crash project. In the meantime — ” 
“I’ll have my boys start in to 
crack this thing,” the Chief of the 
Confidential Terrestrial* Source Sec- 
tion spoke up. “F’ll fit out a couple 
of volunteers with plastic beaks — ” 
“No cloak and dagger work, gen- 
tlemen! Long range policy will be 
worked out by Deep-Think teams 
back at the Department. Our role 
will be a holding action. Now I 
want suggestions for a comprehen- 
sive, well rounded and decisive 
course for meeting this threat. Any 
recommendation?” 

The Political Officer placed his fin- 
gertips together. “What about a stiff 
Note demanding an erttra week’s 
time?” 

“No! No begging,” the Economic 
Officer objected. I’d say a calm, dig:, 
nified, aggressive withdrawal — as 
soon as possible.” 

“We don’t want to give them the 
idea we spook easily,” the Military 
Attache said. “Let’s delay the 
withdrawal — say, until tomorrow.” 
“Early tomorrow,” Magnan said. 
“Or maybe later today.” 

“Well, I see you’re of a mind 
with me,” Nitworth nodded. “Our 
plan of action is clear, but it re- 
mains to be implemented. We have 
a population of over fifteen million

individuals to relocate.” He eyed the 
Political Officer. “I want five pro- 
posals for resettlement on my desk 
by oh-eight-hundred hours tomor- 
row.” Nitworth rapped out instruc- 
tions. Harried-looking staff members 
arose and hurried from the room. 
Magnan eased toward the door. 

“Where are you going, Magnan?” 
Nitworth snapped. 

“Since you’re so busy, I thought 
I’d just slip back down to Com Inq. 
It was a most interesting orienta- 
tion lecture. Mr. Ambassador. Be 
sure to let us know how it works 
out.” 

“Kindly return to your chair,” Nit- 
worth said coldly. “A number of 
chores remain to be assigned. I 
think you, Magnan, need a little 
field experience. I want you to get 
over to Roolit I and take a look at 
these Qornt personally.” 

Magnan’s mouth opened and 
closed soundlessly. 

“Not afraid of a few Qornt, are 
you, Magnan?” 

“Afraid? Good lord, no, ha ha. 
It’s just that I’m afraid I may lose 
my head and do something rash if 
I go.” 

“Nonsense! A diplomat is immune 
to heroic impulses. Take Retief 
along. No dawdling, now! I want 
you on the way in two hours. Notify 
the transport pool at once. Now get 
going!” 

Magnan nodded unhappily and 
went into the hall. 

“Oh, Retief,” Nitworth said. Re- 
tief turned. 

“Try to restrain Mr. Magnan 
from any impulsive moves — in 
any direction.” 



R etief and Magnan topped a 
ridge and looked down across 
a slope of towering tree-shrubs and 
glossy violet-stemmed palms set 
among flamboyant blossoms of yel- 
low and red, reaching down to^a 
strip of white beach with the bluo 
sea beyond. 

“A delightful vista,” Magnan said, 
mopping at his face. “A pity we 
couldn’t locate the Qornt. We’ll go 
back now and report — ” 

“I’m pretty sure the settlement is 
off to the right,” Retief said. “Why 
don’t you head back for the boat, 
while I ease over and see what I 
can observe.” 

“Retief, we’re engaged in a serious 
mission. This is not a time to think 
of sightseeing.” 

“I’d like to take a good look at 
what we’re giving away.” 

“See here, Retief! One might al- 
most receive the impression that 
you’re questioning Corps policy!” 
“One might, at that. The Qornt 
have made their play, but I think it 
might be valuable to take a look at 
their cards before we fold. If I’m 
not back at the boat in an hour, lift 
without me.” 

“You expect me to make my way 
back alone?” 

“It’s directly down-slope — ” Re- 
tief broke off, listening. Magnan 
clutched at his arm. 

There was a sound of crackling 
foliage. Twenty feet ahead, a leafy 
branch swung aside. An eight-foot 
biped stepped into view, long, thin, 
green-clad legs with back-bending 
knees moving in quick, bird-like 



MIGHTIEST QORN 



67 




steps. A pair of immense black- 
lensed goggles covered staring eyes 
set among bushy green hair above 
a great bone-white beak. The crest 
bobbed as the creature cocked its 
head, listening. 

Magnan gulped audibly. The 
Qornt froze, head tilted, beak aimed 
directly at the spot where the Ter- 
restrials stood in the deep shade of 
a giant trunk. 

“I’ll go for help,” Magnan squeak- 
ed. He whirled and took three leaps 
into the brush. 

A second great green-clad figure 
rose up to block his way. He spun, 
darted to the left. The first Qornt 
pounced, grappled Magnan to its 
narrow chest. Magnan yelled, 
threshing and kicking, broke free, 
turned — and collided with the 
eight-foot alien, coming in fast from 
the right. All three went down in a 
tangle of limbs. 

Retief jumped forward, hauled 
Magnan free, thrust him aside and 
stopped, right fist cocked. The two 
Qornt lay groaning feebly. 

“Nice piece of work, Mr. Mag- 
nan,” Retief said. “You nailed both 
of them.” 

i^nphose undoubtedly are the 
A most bloodthirsty, aggressive, 
merciless countenances it has ever 
been my misfortune to encounter,” 
Magnan said. “It hardly seems fair. 
Eight feet tall and faces like that!” 

The smaller of the two captive 
Qornt ran long, slenders fingers over 
a bony shin, from which he had 
turned back the tight-fitting green 
trousers. 

“It’s not broken,” he whistled 



nasally in passable Terrestrial, eye- 
ing Magnan through the heavy gog- 
gles, now badly cracked. “Small 
thanks to you.” 

Magnan smiled loftily. “I daresay 
you’ll think twice before interfering 
with peaceable diplomats in future.” 
“Diplomats? Surely you jest.” 
“Never mind us,” Retief said. “It’s 
you fellows we’d like to talk about. 
How many of you are there?” 
“Only Zubb and myself.” 

“I mean altogether. How many 
Qornt?” 

The alien whistled shrilly. 

“Here, no signalling!” Magnan 
snapped, looking around. 

“That was merely an expression 
of amusement.” 

“You find the situation amusing? 
I assure you, sir, you are in perilous 
straits at the moment. I may fly into 
another rage, you know.” 

“Please, restrain yourself. I was 
merely somewhat astonished — ” a 
small whistle escaped — “at being 
taken for a Qornt.” 

“Aren’t you a Qornt?” 

“I? Great snail trails, no!” More 
stifled whistles of amusement es- 
caped the beaked face. “Both Zubb 
and I are Verpp. Naturalists, as it 
happens.” 

“You certainly look like Qornt.” 
“Oh, not at all — except perhaps 
to a Terrestrial. The Qornt are 
sturdily built rascals, all over ten 
feet in height. And, of course, they 
do nothing but quarrel. A drone 
caste, actually.” 

“A caste? You mean they’re bio- 
logically the same as you?” 

“Not at all! A Verpp wouldn’t 
think of fertilizing a Qornt.” 



68 



IF 




“I mean to say, you are of the 
same basic stock — descended from 
a common ancestor, perhaps.” 
“We are all Pud’s creatures.” 
“What are the differences between 
you, then?” 

“Why, the Qornt are argumen- 
tive, boastful, lacking in apprecia- 
tion for the finer things of life. One 
dreads to contemplate descending 
to their level.” 

“Do you know anything about a 
Note passed to the Terrestrial Am- 
bassador at Smorbrod?” Retief 
asked. 

T l he beak twitched. “Smorbrod? I 
know of no place called Smor- 
brod.” 

“The outer planet of this system.” 
“Oh, yes. We call it Guzzura. I had 
heard that some sort of creatures 
had established a settlement there, 
but I confess I pay little note to 
such matters.” 

“We’re wasting time, Retief,” 
Magnan said. “We must truss these 
chaps up, hurry back to the boat 
and make our escape. You heard 
what they said.” 

“Are there any Qornt down there 
at the harbor, where the boats are?” 
Retief asked. 

“At Tarroon, you mean? Oh, yes. 
Planning some adventure.” 

“That would be the invasion of 
Smorbrod,” Magnan said. “And un- 
less we hurry, Retief, we’re likely 
to be caught there with the last of 
the evacuees!” 

“How many Qornt would you say 
there are at Tarroon?” 

“Oh, a very large number. Per- 
haps fifteen or twenty.” 

MIGHTIEST QORN 



“Fifteen or twenty what?” Mag- 
nan looked perplexed. 

“Fifteen or twenty Qornt.” 

“You mean that there are only 
fifteen or twenty individual Qornt 
in all?” 

Another whistle. “Not at all. I 
was referring to the local Qornt 
only. There are more at the other 
Centers, of course.” 

“And the Qornt are responsible 
for the ultimatum — unilaterally?” 

“I suppose so; it sounds like them. 
A truculent group, you know. And 
interplanetary relations are rather 
a hobby of theirs.” 

Zubb moaned and stirred. He sat 
up slowly, rubbing his head. He 
spoke to his companion in a shrill 
alien clatter of consonants. 

“What did he say?” 

“Poor Zubb. He blames me for 
his bruises, since it was my idea to 
gather you as specimens.” 

“You should have known better 
than to tackle that fierce-looking 
creature,” Zubb said, pointing his 
beak at Magnan. 

“How does it happen that you 
speak Terrestrial?” Retief asked. 

“Oh, one picks up all sorts of 
dialects.” 

“It’s quite charming, really, ’’Mag- 
nan said. “Such a quaint, archaic 
accent.” 

“Suppose we went down to Tar- 
roon,” Retief asked. “What kind of 
reception would we get?” 

“That depends. I wouldn’t recom- 
mend interfering with the Gwil or 
the Rheuk; it’s their nest-mending 
time, you know. The Boog will be 
busy mating — such a tedious busi- 
ness — and of course the Qornt 

69 




are tied up with their ceremonial 
feasting. I’m afraid no one will take 
any notice of you.” 

“Do you mean to say,” Magnan 
demanded, “that these ferocious 
Qornt, who have issued an ultima- 
tum to the Corps Diplomatique Ter- 
restrienne — who openly avow their 
occupied world — would ignore 
Terrestrials in their midst?” 

“If at all possible.” 

Retief got to his feet. 

“I think our course is clear, Mr. 
Magnan. It’s up to us to go down 
and attract a little attention.” 

Ill 

4CT’m not at all sure we’re 
1 going about this in the right 
way,” Magnan puffed, trotting at 
Retief’s side. “These fellows Zubb 
and Slun — Oh, they seem affable 
enough, but how can we be sure 
we’re not being led into a trap?” 
“We can’t.” 

Maqnan stopped short. “Let’s go 
back.” 

“All right,” Retief said. “Of course 
there may be an ambush — ” 

Magnan moved off. “Let’s keep 
going.” 

The party emerged from the un- 
dergrowth at the edge of a great 
brush-grown mound. Slun took the 
lead, rounded the flank of the hil- 
lock, halted at a rectangular open- 
ing cut into the slope. 

“You can find your way easily 
enough from here,” he said. “You’ll 
excuse us, I hope — ” 

“Nonsense, Slun!” Zubb pushed 
forward. “I’ll escort our guests to 
Qomt Hall.” He twittered briefly to 

70 



his fellow Verpp. Slun twittered 
back. 

“I don’t like it, Retief,” Magnan 
whispered. “Those fellows are plot- 
ting mischief.” 

“Threaten them with violence, Mr 
Magnan. They’re scared of you.” 
“That’s true. And the drubbing 
they received was well-deserved. I’m 
a patient man, but there are occa- 
sions — ” 

“Come along, please,” Zubb call- 
ed. “Another ten minutes’ walk — ” 
“See here, we have no interest in 
investigating this barrow,” Magnan 
announced. “We wish you to take 
us direct to Tarroon to interview 
your military leaders regarding the 
ultimatum!” 

“Yes, yes, of course. Qornt Hall 
lies here inside the village.” 

“This is Tarroon?” 

“A modest civic center, sir, but 
there are those who love it.” 

“No wonder we didn’t observe 
their works from the air,” Magnan 
muttered. “Camouflaged.” He 
moved hesitantly through the open- 
ing. 

The party moved along a wide, 
deserted tunnel which sloped down 
steeply, then leveled off and branch- 
ed. Zubb took the center branch, 
ducking slightly under the nine-foot 
ceiling lit at intervals with what ap- 
peared to be primitive incandescent 
panels. 

“Few signs of an advanced tech- 
nology here,” Magnan whispered. 
“These creatures must devote all 
their talents to warlike enterprise.” 
Ahead, Zubb slowed. A distant 
susurration was audible, a sustained 
high-pitched screeching. “Softly, 

IF 




now. We approach Qornt Hall. They 
can be an irascible lot when dis- 
turbed at their feasting.” 

“When will the feast be over?” 
Magnan called hoarsely. 

“In another few weeks, I should 
imagine, if, as you say, they’ve 
scheduled an invasion for next 
month.” 

“Look here, Zubb.” Magnan shook 
a finger at the tall alien. “How is it 
that these Qornt are allowed to em- 
bark on piratical ventures of this 
sort without reference to the wishes 
of the majority?” 

“Oh, the majority of the Qornt 
favor the move, I imagine.” 

“These few hotheads are per- 
mitted to embroil the planet in war?” 
“Oh, they don’t embroil the planet 
in war. They merely — ” 

“Retief, this is fantastic! I’ve 
heard of iron-fisted military cliques 
before, but this is madness!” 
“Come softly, now.” Zubb beck- 
oned, moving toward a bend in the 
yellow-lit corridor. Retief and Mag- 
nan moved forward. 

T he corridor debouched through 
a high double door into a 
vast oval chamber, high-domed, 
gloomy, ' paneled in dark wood 
and hung with tattered banners, 
scarred halberds, pikes, rusted 
longswords, crossed spears over pa- 
tinaed hauberks, pitted radiation 
armor, corroded power rifles, the 
immense mummified heads of horn- 
ed and fanged animals; Great gut- 
tering torches in wall brackets and 
in stands along the length of the 
long table shed a smoky light that 
reflected from the mirror polish of 

MIGHTIEST QORN 



the red granite floor, gleamed on 
polished silver bowls and paper-thin 
glass, shone jewel-red and gold 
through dark bottles — and cast 
long flickering shadows behind the 
fifteen trolls at the board. 

Lesser trolls — beaked, bush- 
haired, great-eyed — trotted * brisk- 
ly, bird-kneed, bearing steaming 
platters, stood in groups of three 
strumming slender bottle-shaped 
lutes, or pranced an intricate-pat- 
terned dance, unnoticed in the shrill 
uproar as each of the magnificently 
draped, belted, feathered and jewel- 
ed Qornt carried on a shouted con- 
versation with an equally noisy fel- 
low. 

“A most interesting display of 
barbaric splendor,” Magnan breath- 
ed. “Now we’d better be getting 
back.” 

“Ah, a moment,” Zubb said. “Ob- 
serve the Qornt — the tallest of 
the feasters — he with the head- 
dress of crimson, purple, silver and 
pink.” 

“Twelve feet if he’s an inch,” 
Magnan estimated. “And now we 
really must hurry along — ” 

“That one is chief among these 
rowdies. I’m sure you’ll want a word 
with him. He controls not only the 
Tarroonian vessels but those from 
the other Centers as well.” 

“What kind of vessels? Warships?" 

“Certainly. What other kind 
would the Qornt bother with?” 

“I don’t suppose,” Magnan said 
casually, “that you’d know the type, 
tonnage, armament and manning of 
these vessels? And how many units 
comprise the fleet? And where 
they’re based at present?” 

71 




“They’re fully automated twenty- 
thousand-ton all-purpose dread- 
naughts. They mount a variety of 
weapons. The Qornt are fond of 
that sort of thing. Each of the Qornt 
has his own, of course. They’re vir- 
tually identical, except for the per- 
sonal touches each individual has 
given his ship.” 

“Great heavens, Retief!” Magnan 
exclaimed in a whisper. “It sounds 
as though these brutes employ a 
battle armada as simpler souls 

might a set of toy sailboats!” 

Retief stepped past Magnan and 
Zubb to study the feasting hall. “I 
can see that their votes would carry 
all the necessary weight.” 

“And now an interview with the 
Qorn himself,” Zubb shrilled. “If 
you’ll kindly step along, gentle- 

men. .” 

“That won’t be necessary,” Mag- 
nan said hastily, “I’ve decided to 
refer the matter to committee.” 
“After having come so far,” Zubb 
said, “it would be a pity to miss 
having a cosy chat.” 

There was a pause. 

“Ah . Retief,” Magnan said. 

“Zubb has just presented a most 
compelling argument. .” 

R etief turned. Zubb stood gripping 
an ornately decorated power 
pistol in- one bony hand, a slim 

needier in the other. Both were 
pointed at Magnan’s chest. 

“I suspected you had hidden quali- 
ties, Zubb,” Retief commented. 

“See here, Zubb! We’re diplo- 
mats!” Magnan started. 

“Careful, Mr. Magnan; you may 
goad him to a frenzy.” 

72 



“By no means,” Zubb whistled. “I 
much prefer to observe the frenzy 
of the Qornt when presented with 
the news that two peaceful Verpp 
have been assaulted and kidnapped 
by bullying interlopers. If there’s 
anything that annoys the Qornt, it’s 
Qornt-like behavior in others. Now 
step along, please.” 

“Rest assured, this will be re- 
ported!” 

“I doubt it.” 

“You’ll face the wrath of Enlight- 
ened Galactic Opinion!” 

“Oh? How big a navy does En- 
lightened Galactic Opinion have?” 
“Stop scaring him, Mr. Magnan. 
He may get nervous and shoot.” 
Retief stepped into the banquet hall, 
headed for the resplendent figure 
at the head of the table. A trio of 
flute-players broke off in mid-bleat, 
staring. An ' inverted pyramid of 
tumblers blinked as Retief swung 
past, followed by Magnan and the 
tall Verpp. The shrill chatter at the 
table faded. 

Qorn turned as Retief came up, 
blinking three-inch eyes. Zubb 
stepped forward, gibbered, waving 
his arms excitedly. Qorn pushed 
back his chair — a low, heavily 
padded stool — and stared unwink- 
ing at Retief, moving his head to 
bring first one great round eye, then 
the other, to bear. There were small 
blue veins in the immense fleshy 
beak The bushy hair, springing out 
in a giant halo around the grayish, 
porous-skinned face, was wiry, stiff, 
moss-green, with tufts of chartreuse 
fuzz surrounding what appeared to 
be tympanic membranes. The tall 
headdress of scarlet silk and purple 

IP 




feathers was slightly askew, and a 
loop of pink pearls had slipped 
down above one eye. 

Zubb finished his speech and fell 
silent, breathing hard. 

Qom looked Retief over in silence, 
then belched. 

“Not bad,” Retief said admiringly. 
“Maybe we could get up a match 
between you and Ambassador Stem- 
wheeler. You’ve got the volume on 
him, but he’s got timbre.” 

“So,” Qorn hooted in a resonant 
tenor. “You come from Guzzum, 
eh? Or Smorbrod, as I think you 
call it What is it you’re after? More 
time? A compromise? Negotiations? 
Peace?” He slammed a bony hand 
against the table. “The answer is 
no!” 

Zubb twittered. Qorn cocked an 
eye, motioned to a servant. “Chain 
that one.” He indicated Magnan. His 
eyes went to Retief. “This one’s big- 
ger; you’d best chain him, too.” 

“Why, your Excellency — ” Mag- 
nan started, stepping forward. 

“Stay back!” Qom hooted. “Stand 
over there where I can keep an eye 
on you.” 

“Your Excellency, I’m empower- 
ed — ” 

“Not ,here, you’re not!” Qom 
trumpeted. “Want peace, do you? 
Well, I don’t want peace! I’ve had a 
surfeit of peace these last two cen- 
turies! I want action! Loot! Adven- 
ture! Glory!” He turned to look 
down the table. “How about it, fel- 
lows? It’s war to the knife, eh?” 

T here was a momentary silence 
from all sides. 

“I guess so,” grunted a giant 
MIGHTIEST QORN 



Qomt in iridescent blue with flame- 
colored plumes. 

Qorn’s eyes bulged. He half rose. 
“We’ve been all over this,” he bas- 
sooned. He clamped bony fingers 
on the hilt of a light rapier. “I 
thought I’d made my point!” 

“Oh, sure, Qom.” 

“You bet.” 

“I’m convinced.” 

Qom rumbled and resumed his 
seat. “All for one and one for all, 
that’s us.” 

“And you’re the one, eh, Qorn?” 
Retief commented. 

Magnan cleared his throat. “I 
sense that some of you gentlemen 
are not convinced of the wisdom of 
this move,” he piped, looking along 
the table at the silks, jewels, beaks, 
feather-decked crests and staring 
eyes. 

“Silence!” Qom hooted. “No use 
your talking to my loyal lieutenants 
anyway,” he added. “They do what- 
ever I convince them they ought to 
do.” 

“But I’m sure that on more ma- 
ture consideration — ” 

“I can lick any Qornt in the house.” 
Qorn said. “That’s why I’m Qom.” 
He belched again. 

A servant came up staggering un- 
der a weight of chain, dropped it 
with a crash at Magnan’s feet. Zubb 
aimed the guns while the servant 
wrapped three loops around Mag- 
nan’s wrists, snapped a lock in 
place. 

“You next!” The guns pointed at 
Retief s chest. He held out his arms. 
Four loops of silvery-gray chain in 
half-inch links dropped around 
them. The servant cinched them up 

73 




tight, squeezed a lock through the 
ends and closed it. 

“Now,” Qorn said, lolling back in 
his chair, glass in hand. “There’s a 
bit of sport to be had here, lads. 
What shall we do with them?” 

“Let them go,” the blue and flame 
Qornt said glumly. 

“You can do better than that,” 
Qorn hooted. “Now here’s a sugges- 
tion: we carve them up a little — 
lop off the external labiae and pin- 
nae, say — and ship them back.” 
“Good lord! Retief, he’s talking 
about cutting off our ears and send- 
ing us home mutilated! What a bar- 
baric proposal!” 

“It wouldn’t be the first time a 
Terrestrial diplomat got a trim- 
ming,” Retief commented. 

“It should have the effect of stim- 
ulating the Terries to put up a rea- 
sonable scrap,” Qorn said judicious- 
ly. “I have a feeling that they’re 
thinking of giving up without a 
struggle.” 

“Oh, I doubt that,” the blue-and- 
flame Qornt said. “Why should 
they?” 

Qorn rolled an eye at Retief and 
another at Magnan. “Take these 
two,” he hooted. “I’ll wager they 
came here to negotiate a surrender!” 
“Well,” Magnan started. 

“Hold it, Mr. Magnan,” Retief 
said, “I’ll -tell him.” 

“What’s your proposal?” Qorn 
whistled, taking a gulp from his gob- 
let. “A fifty-fifty split? Monetary 
reparations? Alternate territory? I 
can assure you, it’s useless. We 
Qornt like to fight.” 

“I’m afraid you’ve gotten the 
wrong impression, your Excellency,” 

74 



Retief said blandly. “We didn’t come 
to negotiate. We came to deliver 
an Ultimatum.” 

“What?” Qorn trumpeted. Behind 
Retief, Magnan spluttered. 

“We plan to use this planet for 
target practice,” Retief said. “A new 
type hell bomb we’ve worked out. 
Have all your people off of it in 
seventy-two hours, or suffer the con- 
sequences.” 

IV 4 

4C"\7"ou have the gall,” Qorn 
I stormed, “to stand here in 
the center of Qornt Hall — unin- 
vited, at that — and in chains — ” 

“Oh, these,” Retief said. He tensed 
his arms. The soft aluminum links 
stretched and broke. He shook the 
light metal free. “We diplomats like 
to go along with colorful local cus- 
toms, but I wouldn’t want to mis- 
lead you. Now, as to the evacuation 
of Roolit I — ” 

Zubb screeched, waved the guns. 
The Qornt were jabbering. 

“I told you they were brutes,” 
Zubb shrilled. 

Qorn slammed his fist down on 
the table. “I don’t care what they 
are!” he honked. “Evacuate, hell! I 
can field eighty-five combat-ready 
ships!” 

“And we can englobe every one 
of them with a thousand Peace En- 
forcers with a hundred megatons/ 
second firepower each.” 

“Retief.” Magnan tugged at his 
sleeve. “Don’t forget their super- 
drive.” 

“That’s all right. They don’t have 
one.” 



IF 




“But — ” 

“We’ll take you on!” Qorn French- 
horned. “We’re the Qorn! We glory 
in battle! We live in fame or go 
down in — ” 

“Hogwash,” the flame-and-blue 
Qorn cut in. “If it wasn’t for you, 
Qorn, we could sit around and feast 
and brag and enjoy life without hav- 
ing to prove anything.” 

“Qorn, you seem to be the fire- 
brand here,” Retief said. “I think the 
rest of the boys would listen to rea- 
son — ” 

“Over my dead body!” 

“My idea exactly,” Retief said. 
“You claim you can lick any man in 
the house. Unwind yourself from 
your ribbons and step out here on 
the floor, and we’ll see how good 
you are at backing up your con- 
versation.” 

M agnan hovered at Retiefs 
side. “Twelve feet tall,” he 
moaned. “And did you notice the 
size of those hands?” 

Retief watched as Qorn’s aides 
helped him out of his formal trap- 
pings. “I wouldn’t worry too much, 
Mr. Magnan. This is a light-Gee 
world. I doubt if old Qorn would 
weigh up at more than two-fifty 
standard pounds here.” 

“But that phenomenal reach — ” 
“I’ll peck away at him at knee 
level. When he bends over to swat 
me, I’ll get a crack at him.” 

Across the cleared floor, Qorn 
shook off his helpers with a snort. 
“Enough! Let me at the upstart!” 
Retief moved out to meet him, 
watching the upraised backward- 
jointed arms. Qorn stalked forward, 

MIGHTIEST QORN 



long lean legs bent, long horny feet 
clacking against the polished floor. 
The other aliens — both servitors 
and bejeweled Qornt — formed a 
wide circle, all eyes unwaveringly on 
the combatants. 

Qorn struck suddenly, a long arm 
flashing down in a vicious cut at 
Retief, who leaned aside, caught one 
lean shank below the knee. Qorn 
bent to haul Retief from his leg — 
and staggered back as a haymaker 
took him just below the beak. A 
screech went up from the crowd as 
Retief leaped clear. 

Qorn hissed and charged. Retief 
whirled aside, then struck the alien’s 
off-leg in a flying tackle. Qorn lean- 
ed, arms windmilling, crashed to the 
floor. "Retief whirled, dived for the 
left arm, whipped it behind the nar- 
row back, seized Qorn’s neck in a 
stranglehold and threw his weight 
backward. Qorn fell on his back, his 
legs squatted out at an awkward 
angle. He squawked and beat his 
free arm on the floor, reaching in 
vain for Retief. 

Zubb stepped forward, pistols 
ready. Magnan stepped before him. 

“Need I remind you, sir,” he said 
icily, “that this is an official diplo- 
matic function? I can brook no in- 
terference from disinterested par- 
ties.” 

Zubb hesitated. Magnan held out 
a hand. “I must ask you to hand me 
your weapons, Zubb.” 

“Look here,” Zubb began. 

“I may lose my temper,” Magnan 
hinted. Zubb lowered the guns, 
passed them to Magnan. He thrust 
them into his belt with a sour smile, 
turned back to watch the encounter. 

75 




Retief had thrown a turn of violet 
silk around Qorn’s left wrist, bound 
k to the alien’s neck. Another wisp 
of stuff floated from Qorn’s shoul- 
der. Retief, still holding Qorn in an 
awkward sprawl, wrapped it around 
one outflung leg, trussed ankle and 
thigh together. Qorn flopped, hoot- 
ing. At each movement, the con- 
stricting loop around his neck, jerk- 
ed his head back, the green crest 
tossing wildly. 

“If I were you. I’d relax,” Retief 
said, rising and releasing his grip. 
Qorn got a leg under him; Retief 
kicked it. Qorn’s chin hit the floor 
with a hollow clack. He wilted, an 
ungainly tangle of over-long limbs 
and gay silks. 

Retief turned to the watching 
crowd. “Next?” he called. 

The blue and flame Qornt stepped 
forward. “Maybe this would be a 
good time to elect a new leader,” he 
said. “Now, my qualifications — ” 
“Sit down,” Retief said loudly. He 
stepped to the head of the table, 
seated himself in Qorn’s vacated 
chair. “A couple of you finish truss- 
ing Qorn up for me.” 

“But we must select a leader!” 
“That won’t be necessary, boys. 
I’m your new leader.” 

44 As I see it,” Retief said, drib- 
bling cigar ashes into an empty 
wine glass, “you Qornt like to 
be warriors, but you don’t par- 
ticularly like to fight.” 

“We don’t mind a little fighting 
— within reason. And, of course, 
as Qornt, we’re expected to die in 
battle. But what I say is, why rush 
tilings?” 



“I have a suggestion,” Magnan 
said. “Why not turn the reins of gov- 
ernment over to the Verpp? They 
seem a level-headed group.” 

“What good would that do? QornJ 
are Qornt. It seems there’s always 
one among us who’s a slave to in- 
stinct — and, naturally, we have to 
follow him.” 

“Why?” 

“Because that’s the way it’s done.” 
“Why not do it another way?” 
Magnan offered. “Now, I’d like to 
suggest community singing — ” 

“If we gave up fighting, we might 
live too long. Then what would hap- 
pen?” 

“Live too long?” Magnan looked 
puzzled. 

“When estivating time comes 
there’d be no burrows for us. Any- 
way, with the new Qornt stepping 
on our heels — ” 

“I’ve lost the thread,” Magnan 
said. “Who are the new Qornt?” 
“After estivating, the Verpp moult, 
and then they’re Qornt, of course. 
The Gwil become Boog, the Boog 
become Rheuk, the Rheuk meta- 
morphosize into Verpp — ” 

“You mean Slun and Zubb — 
the mild-natured naturalists — will 
become warmongers like Qorn?” 
“Very likely. ‘The milder the 
Verpp, the wilder the Qorn,’ as the 
old saying goes.” 

“What do Qornt turn into?” Re- 
tief asked. 

“Hmmmm. That’s a good ques- 
tion. So far, none have survived 
Qornthood.” 

“Have you thought of forsaking 
your warlike ways?” Magnan asked. 
“What about taking up sheepherd- 

IF 



76 




ing and regular church attendance?” 
“Don’t mistake me. We Qornt like 
a military life. It’s great sport to sit 
around roaring fires and drink and 
tell lies and then go dashing off to 
enjoy a brisk affray and some leis- 
urely looting afterward. But we pre- 
fer a nice numerical advantage. Not 
this business of tackling you Ter- 
restrials over on Guzzum — that was 
a mad notion. We had no idea what 
your strength was.” 

“But now that’s all off, of course,” 
Magnan chirped. “Now that we’ve 
had diplomatic relations and all — ” 
“Oh, by no means. The fleet lifts 
in thirty days. After all, we’re Qornt; 
we have to satisfy our drive to ac- 
tion.” 

“But Mr. Retief is your leader 
now. He won’t let you!” 

“Only a dead Qornt stays home 
when Attack day comes. And even 
if he orders us all to cut our own 
throats, there are still the other 
Centers — all with their own lead- 
ers. No, gentlemen, the Invasion is 
definitely on.” 

“Why don’t you go invade some- 
body else?” Magnan suggested. “I 
could name some very attractive 
prospects — outside my sector, of 
course.” * 

“Hold everything,” Retief said. “I 
think we’ve got the basis of a deal 
here. 

V 

A t the head of a double column 
of gaudily caparisoned Qornt, 
Retief and Magnan strolled across 
the ramp toward the bright tower 
of the CDT Sector HQ. Ahead, 



gates opened, and a black Corps 
limousine emerged, flying an Am- 
bassadorial flag under a plain square 
of white. 

“Curious,” Magnan commented. 
“I wonder what the significance of 
the white ensign might be?” 

Retief raised a hand. The column 
halted with a clash of accoutrements 
and a rasp of Qornt boots. Retief 
looked back along the line. The high 
white sun flashed on bright silks, 
polished buckles, deep-dyed plumes, 
butts of pistols, the soft gleam of 
leather. 

“A brave show indeed,” Magnan 
commented approvingly. “I confess 
the idea has merit.” 

The limousine pulled up with a 
squeal of brakes, stood on two fat- 
tired wheels, gyros humming softly. 
The hatch popped up. A portly 
diplomat stepped out. 

“Why Ambassador Nitworth,” 
Magnan glowed. “This is very kind 
of you.” 

“Keep cool, Magnan,” Nitworth 
said in a strained voice. “We’ll at- 
tempt to get you out of this.” 

He stepped past Magnan’s out- 
stretched hand and looked hesitant- 
ly at the ramrod-straight line of 
Qornt, eighty-five strong — and be- 
yond, at the eighty-five tall Qornt 
dreadnaughts. 

“Good afternoon, sir ... ah, 
Your Excellency,” Nitworth said, 
blinking up at the leading Qornt. 
“You are Commander of the Strike 
Force, I assume?” 

“Nope,” the Qornt said shortly. 

“I . ah . wish to request seven- 
ty-two hours in which to evacuate 
Headquarters,” Nitworth plowed on. 

77 



MIGHTIEST QORN 




“Mr. Ambassador,” Retief said. 
“This — ” 

“Don’t panic, Retief. I’ll attempt 
to secure your release,” Nitworth 
hissed over his shoulder. “Now — ” 

“You will address our leader with 
more respect!” the tall Qornt hoot- 
ed, eyeing Nitworth ominously from 
eleven feet up. 

“Oh, yes indeed, sir . your Ex- 
cellency . Commander. Now, 
about the invasion — ” 

“Mr. Secretary,” Magnan tugged 
at Nitworth’s sleeve. 

“In heaven’s name, permit me to 
negotiate in peace!” Nitworth 
snapped. He rearranged his features. 
“Now your Excellency, we’ve ar- 
ranged to evacuate Smorbrod, of 
course, just as you requested — ” 

“Requested?” the Qornt honked. 

“Ah . demanded, that is. Quite 
rightly of course. Ordered. Instruct- 
ed. And, of course, we’ll be only too 
pleased to follow any other instruc- 
tions you might have.” 

“You don’t quite get the big pic- 
ture, Mr. Secretary,” Retief said. 
“This isn’t — ” 

“Silence, confound you!” Nitworth 
barked. The leading Qornt looked at 
Retief. He nodded. Two bony hands 
shot out, seized Nitworth and 
stuffed a length of bright pink silk 
into his mouth, then spun him 
around and held him facing Retief. 

“If you don’t mind my taking this 
opportunity to brief you, Mr. Am- 
bassador,” Retief said blandly, “I 
think I should mention that this 
isn’t an invasion fleet. These are the 
new recruits for the Peace Enforce- 
ment Corps.” 

Magnan stepped forward, glanced 



at the gag in Ambassador Nitworth’s 
mouth, hesitated, then cleared his 
throat. “We felt,” he said, “that the 
establishment of a Foreign Brigade 
within the P. E. Corps structure 
would provide the element of nov- 
elty the Department has requested 
in our recruiting, and at the same 
time would remove the stigma of 
Terrestrial chauvinism from future 
punitive operations.” 

Nitworth starred, eyes bulging. 
He grunted, reaching for the gag, 
caught the Qornt’s eye on him, 
dropped his hands to his sides. 

“I suggest we get the troops in out 
of the hot sun,” Retief said. Magnan 
edged close. “What about the gag?” 
he whispered. 

“Let’s leave it where it is for a 
while,” Retief murmured. “It may 
save us a few concessions.” 

A n hour later, Nitworth, breathing 
freely again, glowered across 
his desk at Retief and Magnan. 

“This entire affair,” he rum- 
bled, “has made me appear to be a 
fool!” 

“But we who are privileged to 
serve on your staff already know 
just how clever you are,” Magnan 
burbled. 

Nitworth purpled. “You’re skirt- 
ing insolence, Magnan,” he roared. 
“Why was I not informed of the ar- 
rangements? What was I to as- 
sume at the sight of eighty-five war 
vessels over my headquarters, un- 
announced?” 

“We tried to get through, but our 
wavelengths — ” 

“Bah! Sterner souls than I would 
have quailed at the spectacle!” 



78 



IF 




“Oh, you were perfectly justified 
in panicking — ” 

“I did not panic!” Nitworth bel- 
lowed. “I merely adjusted to the ap- 
parent circumstances. Now, I’m of 
two minds as to the advisability of 
this foreign legion idea of yours. 
Still, it may have merit. I believe the 
wisest course would be to dispatch 
them on a long training cruise in an 
uninhabited sector of space — ” 

The office windows rattled. “What 
the devil!” Nitworth turned, stared 
out at the ramp where a Qornt ship 
rose slowly on a column of pale blue 
light. The vibration increased as a 
second ship lifted, then a third. 

Nitworth whirled on Magnan. 
“What’s this! Who ordered these re- 
cruits to embark without my per- 
mission?” 

“I took the liberty of giving them 
an errand to run, Mr. Secretary,” 
Retief said. “There was that little 
matter of the Groaci infiltrating the 
Sirenian System. I sent the boys off 
to handle it.” 

“Call them back at once!” 

“I’m afraid that won’t be possible. 
They’re under orders to maintain to- 
tal communications silence until 
completion of the mission.” 

Nitworth drummed his fingers on 
the desk top. Slowly, a thoughtful 
expression dawned. He nodded. 

“This may work out,” he said. “I 
should call them back, but since the 
fleet is out of contact, I’m unable 
to do so, correct? Thus I can hard- 
ly be held responsible for any over- 
enthusiasm in chastising the Groaci.” 
He closed one eye in a broad wink 
at Magnan. “Very well, gentlemen, 
I’ll overlook the irregularity this 

MIGHTIEST QORN 



time. Magnan, see to It the Smor- 
brodian public are notified they can 
remain where they are. And by the 
way, did you by any chance discov- 
er the technique of the indetectable 
drive the Qornt use?” 

“No, sir. That is, yes, sir.” 

“Well? Well?” 

“There isn’t any. The Qornt were 
there all the while. Underground.” 
“Underground? Doing what?” 
“Hibernating — for two hundred 
years at a stretch.” 

O utside in the corridor, Mag- 
nan came up to Retief, who 
stood talking to a tall man in a pi- 
lot’s coverall. 

“I’ll be tied up, sending through 
full details on my — our — your 
recruiting theme, Retief,” Magnan 
said. “Suppose you run into the city 
to assist the new Verpp Consul in 
settling in.” 

“I’ll do that, Mr. Magnan. Any- 
thing else?” 

Magnan raised his eyebrows. 
“You’re remarkably compliant to- 
day, Retief. I’ll arrange transporta- 
tion.” 

“Don’t bother, Mr. Magnan. Cy 
here will run me over. He was the 
pilot who ferried us over to Roolit 
I, you recall.” 

“I’ll be with you as soon as I 
pack a few phone numbers, Retief,” 
the pilot said. He moved off. Mag- 
nan followed him with a disapprov- 
ing eye. “An uncouth sort, I fan- 
cied. I trust you’re not consorting 
with his kind socially.” 

“I wouldn’t say that, exactly,” 
Retief said. “We just want to go over 
a few figures together.” END

They were the doomed captives 
of alien creatures ... on the 
planet where Mankind was born! 



T he reek and noise at the back 
of the circus were familiar to 
Javlin Bartramm. He felt the hard 
network of nerves in his solar plexus 
tighten. 

There were crowds of the reduls 
here, jostling and staring to see the 
day’s entry arrive. You didn’t have 
to pay to stand and rubberneck in 
the street; this lot probably couldn’t 
afford seats for the arena. Javlin 
looked away from them in scorn. 
All the same, he felt some gratifica- 
tion when they sent up a cheeping 
cheer at the sight of him. They loved 
a human victim. 

His keeper undid the cart door 
and led him out, still chained. They 
went through the entrance, from 
blinding sunshine to dark, into the 
damp unsavory warren below the 



main stadium. Several reduls were 
moving about here, officials mainly. 
One or two called good luck to him; 
one chirped, “The crowd’s in a good 
mood today, vertebrate.” Javlin 
showed no response. 

His trainer, Ik So Baar, came up, 
a flamboyant redul towering above 
Javlin. He wore an array of spare 
gloves strapped across his orange 
belly. The white tiara that fitted 
round his antennae appeared only 
on sports days. 

“Greetings, Javlin. You look in 
the rudest of health. I’m glad you 
are not fighting me.” 

“Greetings, Ik So.” He slipped the 
lip-whistle into his mouth so that he 
could answer in a fair approxima- 
tion of the redul language. “Is my 
opponent ready to be slain? Remem- 
ber I go free if I win this bout — 



80 



IF 



ft will be my twelfth victory in suc- 
cession.” 

“There’s been a change in the pro- 
gram, Javlin. Your Sirian opponent 
escaped in the night and had to be 
killed. You are entered in a double 
double.” 

Javlin wrenched at his chains so 
hard that the keeper was swung off 
balance. 

“Ik So! You betray me! How 
much cajsh have 1 won for you? I 
will not fight a double double.” 

There was no change of expres- 
sion on the insect mask. 

“Then you will die, my pet verte- 
brate. The new arrangement is not 
my idea. You know by now that I 
get more cajsh for having you in a 
solo. Double double it has to be. 
These are my orders. Keeper, Cell 
107 with him!” 

Fighting against his keeper’s pull, 
Javlin cried, “I’ve got some rights, 
Ik So. I demand to see the arena 
promoter.” 

“Pipe down, you stupid verte- 
brate! You have to do what you’re 
ordered. I told you it wasn’t my 
fault.” 

“Well, for God’s sake, who am I 
fighting with?” 

“You will be shackled to a fellow 
from the farms. He’s had one or two 
preliminary bouts; they say he’s 
good.” • 

“From the farms. .” Javlin broke 
into the filthiest redulian oaths he 
knew. Ik So came back towards 
him and slipped one of the metal 
gloves on to his forepincers; it gave 
him a cruel tearing weapon with a 
multitude of barbs. He held it up 
to Javlin’s face. 



“Don’t use that language to me, 
my mammalian friend. Humans 
from the farms or from space, 
what’s the difference? This young 
fellow will fight well enough if you 
muck in with him. And you’d better 
muck in. You’re billed to battle 
against a couple of yillibeeth.” 
Before Javlin could answer, the 
tall figure turned and strode down 
the corridor, moving twice as fast as 
a man could walk. 

Javlin let himself be led to Cell 
107. The warder, a worker-redul 
with a gray belly, unlocked his 
chains and pushed him in, barring 
the door behind him. The cell smelt 
of alien species and apprehensions. 

Javlin went and sat down on the 
bench. He needed to think. 

H e knew himself for a simple 
man — and knew that that 
knowledge meant the simplicity was 
relative. But his five years of cap- 
tivity here under the reduls had not 
been all wasted. Ik So had trained 
him well in the arts of survival; and 
when you came down to brass tacks, 
there was no more proper pleasure in 
the universe than surviving. It was 
uncomplicated. It carried no re- 
sponsibilities to anyone but your- 
self. 

That was what he hated about 
the double double events, which till 
now he had always been lucky 
enough to avoid. They carried a 
responsibility to your fellow fighter. 

From the beginning he had been 
well equipped to survive the gladia- 
torial routine. When his scoutship, 
the Plunderhorse, had been captured 
by redul forces Five years ago, 

IF

Javlin Bartramm was duelling mas- 
ter and judo expert, as well as Top 
Armament Sergeant. The army ships 
had a long tradition, going back 
some six centuries, of sport aboard; 
it provided the ideal mixture of 
time-passer and needed exercise. Of 
all the members of the Plunder- 
horse’s crew who had been taken 
captive, Javlin was — as far as he 
knew — the only survivor after five 
years of the insect race’s rough 
games. 

Luck had played its part in his 
survival. He had liked Ik So Baar. 
Liking was a strange thing to feel 
for a nine-foot armored grasshopper 
with forearms like a lobster and a 
walk like a tyrannosaurus’s run, but 
a sympathy existed between them — 
and would continue to exist until he 
was killed in the ring, Javlin thought. 
With his bottom on the cold bench, 
he knew that Ik So would not betray 
him into a double double. The redul 
had had to obey the promoter’s or- 
ders. Ik So needed his twelfth vic- 
tory, so that he could free Javlin to 
help him train the other species 
down at the gladiatorial farm. Both 
of them knew that would be an 
effective partnership. 

So. Now y / as the time for luck to 
be with Javlin again. 

He sank on to his knees and 
looked down at the stone, brought 
his forehead down on to it, gazed 
down into the earth, into the cold 
ground, the warm rocks, the molten 
core, trying to visualize each, to 
draw from them attributes that 
would help him: cold for his brain, 
warm for his temper, molten for his 
energies. 



Strengthened by prayer, he stood 
up. The redul workers had yet to 
bring him his armor and the part- 
ner he was to fight with. He had 
long since learnt the ability to wait 
without resenting waiting. With pro- 
fessional care, he exercised himself 
slowly, checking the proper function 
of each muscle. As he did so, he 
heard the crowds cheer in the arena. 
He turned to peer out of the cell’s 
further door, an affair of tightly 
set bars that allowed a narrow view 
of the combat area and the stands 
beyond. 

There was a centaur out there in 
the sunlight, fighting an Aldebaran 
bat-leopard. The centaur wore no 
armor but an iron cuirass; he had 
no weapons but his hooves and his 
hands. The bat-leopard, though its 
wings were clipped to prevent it 
flying out of the stadium, had dan- 
gerous claws and a great turn of 
speed. Only because its tongue had 
been cut out, ruining its echo-loca- 
tion system, was the contest any- 
thing like fair. The concept of fair- 
ness was lost upon the reduls, 
though; they preferred blood to 
justice. 

Javlin saw the kill. The centaur, 
a gallant creature with a human- 
like head and an immense gold mane 
that began from his eyebrows, was 
plainly tiring. He eluded the bat- 
leopard as it swooped down on him, 
wheeling quickly round on his hind 
legs and trampling on its wing. But 
the bat-leopard turned and raked 
the other’s legs with a slash of claws. 
The centaur toppled hamstrung to 
the ground. As he fell, he lashed out 
savagely with his forelegs, but the

bat-leopard nipped in and tore his 
throat from side to side above the 
cuirass. It then dragged itself away 
under its mottled wings, like a lame 
prima donna dressed in a leather 
cape. 

The centaur struggled and lay 
still, as if the weight of whistling 
cheers that rose from the audience 
bore him down. Through the nar- 
row bars, Javlin saw the throat bleed 
and the lungs heave as the defeated 
one sprawled in the dust. 

“What do you dream of, dying 
there in the sun?” Javlin asked. 

He turned away from the sight 
and the question. He sat quietly 
down on the bench and folded his 
arms. 

When the din outside told him 
that the next bout had begun, the 
passage door opened and a young 
human was pushed in. Javlin did not 
need telling that this was to be his 
partner in the double double against 
the yillibeeth. 

It was a girl. 

iG^Tou’re Javlin?” she said. “I 
I know of you. My name’s 
Awn.” 

He kept himself under control, 
his brows drawn together as he 
stared at her. 

“You know what you’re here for?” 

“This will be my first public 
fight,” she said. 

Her hair was clipped short as a 
man’s. Her skin was tanned and 
harsh, her left arm bore a gruesome 
scar. She held herself lithely on her 
feet. Though her body looked lean 
and hard, even the thick one-piece 
gown she wore to thigh length did 



not conceal the feminine curves of 
her body. She was not pretty, but 
Javlin had to admire the set of her 
mouth and her cool gray gaze. 

“I’ve had some stinking news this 
morning, but Ik So Baar never 
broke it to me that I was to be 
saddled with a woman,” he said. 

“Ik probably didn’t know — that 
I'm a woman, I mean. The reduls 
are either neuter or hermaphrodite, 
unless they happen to be a rare 
queen. Didn’t you know 'that? They 
can’t tell the difference between hu- 
man male and female.” 

He spat. “You can’t tell me any- 
thing about reduls.” 

She spat. “If you knew, why 
blame me? You don’t think I like 
being here? You don’t think I asked 
to join the great Javlin?” 

Without answering he bent and 
began to massage the muscles of his 
calf. Since he occupied the middle 
of the bench, the girl remained 
standing. She watched him steadily. 
When he looked up again, she asked, 
“What or who are we fighting?” 
No surprise was left in him. “They 
didn’t tell you?” 

“I’ve only just been pushed into 
this double double, as I imagine you 
have. I asked you, what are we 
fighting?” 

“Just a couple of yillibeeths.” 
He injected unconcern into his 
voice to make the shock of what he 
said the greater. He massaged the 
muscles of the other calf. An aphroh- 
ale would have come in very welcome 
now. These crazy insects had no 
equivalent of the terrestrial prisoner- 
ate-a-hearty-breakfast routine. When 
he glanced up under his eyebrows, 



84 



IF 




the girl still stood motionless, but 
her face had gone pale. 

“Know what the yillibeeths are, 
little girl?” 

She didn’t answer, so he went on, 
“The reduls resemble some terrestrial 
insects. They go through several 
stages of development, you know; 
reduls are just the final adult stage. 
Their larval stage is rather like the 
larval stage of the dragon fly. It’s 
a greedy, omnivorous beast. It’s 
aquatic and it’s big. It’s armored. 
It’s called a yillibeeth. That’s what 
we are going to be tied together to 
fight, a couple of big hungry yilli- 
beeth. Are you feeling like dying 
this morning, Awn?” 

Instead of answering, she turned 
her head away and brought a hand 
up to her mouth. 

“Oh, no! No crying in here, for 
Earth’s sake!” he said. He got up, 
yelled through the passage door, “Ik 
So, Ik So, you traitor, get this bloody 
woman out of here!” . recalled 
himself, jammed the lip-whistle into 
his mouth and was about to call 
again when Awn caught him a back- 
handed blow across the face. 

She faced him like a tiger. 

“You creature, you cowardly apol- 
ogy of a man! Do you think I weep 
for fear? I don’t weep. I’ve lived 
nineteen years on this damned plan- 
et in their damned farms. Would I 
still be here if I wept? No — but I 
mourn that you are already defeated, 
you, the great Javlin!” 

He frowned into her blazing face. 

“You don’t seriously think you 
make me a good enough match for 
us to go out there and kill a couple 
of yillibeeth?” 



“Damn your conceit, I’m prepared 
to try.” 

“Fagh!” He thrust the lip-whistle 
into his mouth, and turned back to 
the door. She laughed at him bitterly, 
jeeringly. 

“You’re a lackey to these insects, 
aren’t you, Javlin? If you could see 
what a fool you look with that 
phoney beak of yours stuck on your 
mouth.” 

H e let the instrument drop to 
the end of its chain. Grasping 
the bars, he leaned forward against 
them and looked at her over his 
shoulder. 

“I was trying to get this contest 
called off.” 

“Don’t tell me you haven’t already 
tried. I have.” 

To that he had no answer. He 
went back and sat on the bench. 
She returned to her corner. They 
both folded their arms and stared 
at each other. 

“Why don’t you look out into the 
arena instead of glaring at me? You 
might pick up a few tips.” When she 
did not answer, he said, “I’ll tell 
you what you’ll see. You can see 
the rows of spectators and a box 
where some sort of bigwig sits. I 
don’t know who the bigwig is. It’s 
never a queen — as far as I can 
make out, the queens spend their 
lives underground, turning out eggs 
at the rate of fifty a second. Not 
the sort of life Earth royalty would 
have enjoyed in the old days. Under 
the bigwig’s box there is a red ban- 
ner with their insect hieroglyphs on. 
I asked Ik So once what the hiero- 
glyphs said. He told me they meant

85 




— well, in a rough translation — 
The Greatest Show on Earth . It’s 
funny, isn’t it?” 

“You must admit we do make a 
show.” 

“No, you miss the point. You see, 
that used to be the legend of circuses 
in the old days. But they’ve adopted 
it for their own use since they in- 
vaded Earth. They’re boasting of 
their conquest.” 

“And that’s funny?” 

“In a sort of way. Don’t you feel 
rather ashamed that this planet 
which saw the birth of the human 
race should be overrun by insects?” 

“No. The reduls were here before 
me. I was just born here. Weren’t 
you?” 

“No, I wasn’t. I was born on 
Washington IV. It’s a lovely planet. 
There are hundreds of planets out 
there as fine and varied as Earth 
once was — but it kind of rankles 
to think that this insect brood rules 
Earth.” 

“If you feel so upset about it, why 
don’t you do something?” 

He knotted his fists together. You 
should start explaining history and 
economics just before you ran out 
to be chopped to bits by a big ram- 
pant thing with circular saws for 
hands? 

“It would cost mankind too much 
to reconquer ‘this planet. Too diffi- 
cult. Too many deaths just for senti- 
ment. And think of all those queens 
squirting eggs at a rate of knots; 
humans don’t breed that fast. Hu- 
manity has learnt to face facts.” 

She laughed without humor. 

“That’s good. Why don’t you learn 
to face the fact of me?” 



Javlin had nothing to say to that; 
she would not understand that di- 
rectly he saw her he knew his hope 
of keeping his life had died. She was 
just a liability. Soon he would be 
dying, panting his juices out into the 
dust like that game young centaur 
. only it wouldn’t be dust. 

“We fight in two foot of water,” 
he said. “You know that? The yilli- 
beeth like it. It slows our speed a 
bit. We might drown instead of hav- 
ing our heads bitten off.” 

“I can hear someone coming down 
the corridor. It may be our armor,” 
she said coolly. 

“Did you hear what I said?” 

“You can’t wait to die, Javlin, 
can you?” 

'TT'he bars fell away on the out- 
A side of the door, and it opened. 
The keeper stood there. Ik So Baar 
had not appeared as he usually did. 
The creature flung in their armor 
and weapons and retreated, barring 
the door again behind him. It never 
ceased to astonish Javlin that those 
great dumb brutes of workers had 
intelligence. 

He stooped to pick up his uni- 
form. The girl’s looked so light and 
small. He lifted it, looking from it 
to her. 

“Thank you,” she said. 

“It looks so small and new.” 

“I shouldn’t want anything 
heavier.” 

“You’ve fought in it?” 

“Twice.” There was no need to 
ask whether she had won. 

“We’d better get the stuff strapped 
on, then. We shall know when they 
are getting ready for us; you’ll hear 




the arena being filled with water. 
They’re probably saving us for the 
main events just before noon.” 

“I didn’t know about the two feet 
of water.” 

“Scare you?” 

“No. I’m a good swimmer. Swam 
for fish in the river on the slave 
farm.” 

“You caught fish with your bare 
hands?” 

“No, you dive down and stab them 
with a sharp rock. It takes practice.” 

It was a remembered pleasure. 
She’d actually swum in one of 
Earth’s rivers. He caught himself 
smiling back into her face. 

“Ik So’s place is in the desert,” he 
said, making his voice cold. “Any- 
how, you won’t be able to swim in 
the arena. Two foot of muddy stink- 
ing water helps nobody. And you’ll 
be chained on to me with a four- 
foot length of chain.” 

“Let’s get our armor on, then 
you’d better tell me all you know. 
Perhaps we can work out a plan of 
campaign.” 

As he picked up the combined 
breastplate and shoulder guard, 
Awn untied her belt and lifted her 
dress over her head. Underneath she 
wore only a» ragged pair of white 
briefs. She commenced to take those 
off. 

Javlin stared at her with surprise 
— and pleasure. It had been years 
since he had been within hailing dis- 
tance of a woman. This one — yes, 
this one was a beauty. 

“What are you doing that for?” 
he asked. He hardly recognized his 
own voice. 

“The less we have on the better in 



that water. Aren’t you going to take 
your clothes off?” 

He shook his head. Embarrassed, 
he fumbled on the rest of his kit. At 
least she wouldn’t look so startling 
with her breastplate and skirt armor 
on. He checked his long and -short 
swords, clipping the one into the 
left belt clip, the other into the right. 
They were good swords, made by 
redul armorers to terrestrial specifi- 
cations. When he turned back to 
Awn, she was fully accoutred. 

Nodding in approval, he offered 
her a seat on the bench beside him. 
They clattered against each other 
and smiled. 

Another bout had ended in the 
arena. The cheers and chirrups 
drifted through the bars to them. 

“I’m sorry you’re involved in this,” 
he said with care. 

“I was lucky to be involved in it 
with you.” Her voice was not entire- 
ly steady, but she controlled it in a 
minute. “Can’t I hear water?” 

He had already heard it. An un- 
natural silence radiated from the 
great inhuman crowd in the circus 
as they watched the stuff pour in. It 
would have great emotional signifi- 
cance for them, no doubt, since they 
had all lived in water for some years 
in their previous life stage. 

“They have wide-bore hoses,” he 
said. His own voice had an irritat- 
ing tremor. “The arena fills quite 
rapidly.” 

“Let’s formulate some sort of plan 
of attack then. These things, these 
yillibeeths must have some weak- 
nesses.” 

“And some strengths! That’s what 
you have to watch for.” 



IN THE ARENA 



87 




“I don’t see that. You attack their 
weak points.” 

“We shall be too busy looking out 
for their strong ones. They have 
long, segmented gray bodies — about 
twenty segments, I think. Each seg- 
ment is of chitin or something tough. 
Each segment bears two legs 
equipped with razor combs. At tail 
end and top end they have legs that 
work like sort of buzz saws, cut 
through anything they touch. And 
there are their jaws, of course.” 

T he keeper was back. Its an- 
tennae flopped through the 
grating and then it unbolted the door 
and came in. It bore a length of 
chain as long as the cell was wide. 
Javlin and Awn did not resist as it 
locked them together, fitting the 
bracelets on to Javlin’s right arm 
and Awn’s left. 

“So.” She stared at the chain. “The 
yillibeeths don’t sound to have many 
weak points: They could cut through 
our swords with their buzz saws?” 
“Correct.” 

“Then they could cut through this 
chain. Get it severed near one of 
our wrists, and the other has a better 
long distance weapon than a sword. 
A blow over the head with the end 
of the chain won’t improve their 
speed. How fast are they?” 

“The buzz’ saws take up most of 
their sj>eed. They’re nothing like as 
fast as the reduls. No, you could 
say they were pretty sluggish in 
movement. And the fact that the 
two of them will also be chained 
together should help us.” 

“Where are they chained?” 

“By the middle legs.” 

88 



“That gives them a smaller arc 
of destruction than if they were 
chained by back or front legs. We 
are going to slay these beasts yet, 
Javlin! What a murderous genus it 
must be to put its offspring in the 
arena for the public sport.” 

He laughed. 

“Would you feel sentimental about 
your offspring if you had a million 
babies?” 

“I’ll tell you that when I’ve had 
the first of them. I mean, if I have 
the first of them.” 

He put his hand over hers. 

“No if. We’ll kill the bloody larvae 
okay.” 

“Get the chain severed, the one 
of us with the longest bit of chain 
goes in for the nearest head, the 
other fends off the other brute. 
Right?” 

“Right.” 

There was a worker redul at the 
outer door now, the door that led 
to the arena. He flung it open and 
stood there with a flaming torch, 
ready to drive them out if they did 
not emerge. 

“We’ve — come to it then,” she 
said. Suddenly she clung to him. 

“Let’s take it at a run, love,” he 
said. 

Together, balancing the chain be 
tween them, they ran towards the 
arena. The two yillibeeth were com- 
ing out from the far side, wallowing 
and splashing. The crowd stretched 
up toward the blue sky of earth, 
whistling their heads off. They didn’t 
know what a man and a woman 
could do in combination. Now they 
were going to learn.

The ancient rule was sink or

a planet without spaceflight, 
or sink to utter destruction!

T ie horses and packs were 
loaded before we went aboard 
the scoutship. The scout bay is no 
more than a great oversized airlock 
with a dozen small ships squatting 
over their tubes, but it was the last 
of the Ship that I might ever see, 
so I took a long final look from the 
top of the ramp. 



There were sixteen of us girls and 
thirteen boys. We took our places in 
the seats in the center of the scout. 
Riggy Allen made a joke that no- 
body bothered to laugh at, and then 
we were all silent. I was feeling lost 
and just beginning to enjoy it when 
Jimmy Dentremont came over to 
me. He’s red-headed and has a face 
that makes him look about ten. An 
intelligent runt like me. 



DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN

He said what I expected. “Mia, 
do you want to go partners if we 
can get together when we get down?” 

I guess he thought that because 
we were always matched on study 
I liked him. Well, I did when I 
wasn’t mad at him, but now I had 
that crack he’d made about being a 
snob in mind, so I said, “Not likely. 
I want to come back alive.” It wasn’t 
fair, but it was a good crack and he 
went back to his place without say- 
ing anything. 

My name is Mia Havero. I’m 
fourteen, of course, or I wouldn’t 
be telling this. I’m short, dark and 
scrawny, though I don’t expect that 
scrawniness to last much longer. 
Mother is very good looking. In the 
meantime. I’ve got brains as a con- 
solation. 

After we were all settled, George 
Fuhonin, the pilot, raised the ramps. 
We sat there for five minutes while 
they bled air out of our tube and 
then we just . dropped. My stom- 
ach turned flips. We didn’t have to 
leave that way, but George thinks 
it’s fun to be a hot pilot. 

Thinking it over, I was almost 
sorry I’d been stinking to Jimmy D. 
He’s the only competition I have 
my own age. The trouble is, you 
don’t go partners with the competi- 
tion, do you? Besides, there was still 
that crack about being a snob. 

The planet chosen for our Trial 
was called Tintera. The last contact 
the Ship had had with it — and we 
were the ones who dropped them — 
was almost 150 years ago. No con- 
tact since. That had made the Coun- 
cil debate a little before they 
dropped us there, but they decided 



it was all right in the end. It didn’t 
make any practical difference to us 
kids because they never tell you any- 
thing about the place they’re going 
to drop you. All I knew was the 
name. I wouldn't have known that 
much if Daddy weren't Chairman of 
the Council. 

I felt like crawling in a corner of 
the ship and crying, but nobody else 
was breaking down, so I didn't. I 
did feel miserable. I cried when I 
said good-by to Mother and Daddy 
— a real emotional scene — but 
that wasn’t in public. 

I t wasn’t the chance of not 
coming back that bothered me 
really, because I never believed that 
I wouldn’t. The thought that made 
me unhappy was that I would have 
to be on a planet for a whole month. 
Planets make me feel wretched. 

The gravity is always wrong, for 
one thing. Either your arches and 
calves ache or every time you step 
you think you’re going to trip on a 
piece of fluff and break your neck. 
There are vegetables everywhere 
and little grubby things just looking 
for you to crawl on. If you can 
think of anything creepier than that, 
you’ve got a real nasty imagination. 
Worst of all, planets stink. Every 
single one smells — I’ve been on 
enough to know that. A planet is 
all right for a Mud-eater, but not 
for me. 

We have a place in the Ship like 
that — the Third Level — but it’s 
only a thousand square miles and 
any time it gets on your nerves you 
can go up a level or down a level 
and be back in civilization.

When we reached Tintera, they 
started dropping us. We swung over 
the sea from the morning side and 
then dropped low over gray-green 
forested hills. Finally George spotted 
a clear area and dropped into it. 
They don’t care what order you go 
in, so Jimmy D. jumped up, grabbed 
his gear and then led his horse down 
the ramp. I think he was still smart- 
ing from the slap I’d given him. 

In a minute we were airborne 
again. I wondered if I would ever 
see Jimmy — if he would get back 
alive. 

It’s no game we play. When we 
turn fourteen, they drop us on the 
nearest colonized planet and come 
back one month later. That may 
sound like fun to you, but a lot of 
us never come back alive. 

Don’t think I was helpless. I’m 
hell on wheels. They don’t let us 
grow for fourteen years and then 
kick us out to die. They prepare us. 
They do figure, though, that if you 
can’t keep yourself alive by the time 
you’re fourteen, you’re too stupid, 
foolish or unlucky to be any use to 
the Ship. There’s sense behind it. It 
means that everybody on the Ship 
is a person who can take care of 
himself if he has to. Daddy says that 
something has to be done in a closed 
society to keep the population from 
decaying mentally and physically, 
and this is it. And it helps to keep 
the population steady. 

I began to check my gear out — 
sonic pistol, pickup signal so I 
could be found at the end of the 
month, saddle and cinches, food and 
clothes. Venie Morlock has got a 
crush on Jimmy D., and when she 



saw me start getting ready to go, 
she began to check her gear, too. At 
our next landing, I grabbed Nine’s 
reins and cut Venie out smoothly. 
It didn’t have anything to do with 
Jimmy. I just couldn’t stand to put 
off the bad moment any longer. 

The ship lifted impersonally away 
from Nine and me like a rising 
bird, and in just a moment it was 
gone. Its gray-blue color was almost 
the color of the half-overcast sky, 
so I was never sure when I saw it 
last 

II 

T he first night was hell, I guess 
because I’m not used to having 
the lights out. That’s when you real- 
ly start to feel lonely, being alone in 
the dark. When the sun disappears, 
somehow you wonder in your stom- 
ach if it’s really going to come back. 
But I lived through it — one day in 
thirty gone. 

I rode in a spiral search pattern 
during the next two days. I had 
three things in mind — stay alive, 
find people and find some of the 
others. The first was automatic. The 
second was to find out if there was 
a slot I could fit into for a month. 
If not, I would have to find a place 
to camp out, as nasty as that would 
be. The third was to join forces* 
though not with that meatball Jimmy 
D. 

No, he isn’t really a meatball. The 
trouble is that I don’t take nothing 
from nobody, especially him, and 
he doesn’t take nothing from no- 
body, especially me. So we do a lot 
of fighting.

I had a good month for Trial. My 
birthday is in November — too 
dose to Year End Holiday for my 
taste, but this year it was all right. 
It was spring on Tintera, but it was 
December in the Ship, and after we 
got back we had five days of Holi- 
day to celebrate. It gave me some- 
thing to look forward to. 

In two days of riding, I ran onto 
nothing but a few odd-looking ani- 
mals. I shot one small one and ate 
it. It turned out to taste pretty good, 
though not as good as a slice from 
Hambone No. 4, to my mind the best 
meat vat on the Ship. I’ve eaten 
things so gruey-looking that I won- 
dered that anybody had the guts to 
try them in the first place and 
they’ve turned out to taste good. 
And I’ve seen things that looked 
good that I couldn’t keep on my 
stomach. So I guess I was lucky. 

On the third day, I found the 
road. I brought Nine down off the 
hillside, losing sight of the road in 
the trees, and then reaching it in 
file level below. It was narrow and 
made of sand spread over a hard 
base. Out of the marks in the sand, 
I could pick out the tracks of horses 
and both narrow and wide wheels. 
Other tracks I couldn’t identify. 

One of the smartest moves in his- 
tory was to include horses when they 
dropped the colonies. I say “they” 
because, while we did the actual 
dropping, the idea originated with 
the whole evac plan back on Earth. 
Considering how short a time it was 
in which the colonies were estab- 
lished, there was not time to set up 
industry, so they had to have draft 
animals. 



The first of the Great Ships was 
finished in 2025. One of the eight, 
as well as the two that were being 
built then, went up with everything 
else in the Solar System in 2041. In 
that sixteen years 112 colonies 
were planted. I don’t know how 
many of those planets had animals 
that could have been substituted but, 
even if they had, they would have 
had to be domesticated from 
scratch. That would have been stu- 
pid. I'll bet that half the 'colonies 
would have failed if they hadn’t 
had horses. 

TTETe’d come in from the west 
over the ocean, so I traveled 
east on the road. That much water 
makes me nervous, and roads have 
to go somewhere. 

I came on my first travelers three 
hours later. I rounded a tree-lined 
bend, ducking an overhanging 
branch, and pulled Nine to a stop. 
There were five men on horseback 
herding a bunch of the ugliest crea- 
tures alive. 

They were green and grotesque. 
They had squat bodies, long limbs 
and knobby bulges at their joints. 
They had square, flat animal masks 
for faces. But they walked on their 
hind legs and they had paws that 
were almost hands, and that was 
enough to make them seem almost 
human. They made a wordless, chill- 
ing, lowing sound as they milled and 
plodded along. 

I started Nine up again and moved 
slowly to catch up with them. All 
the men on horseback had guns in 
saddle boots. They looked as nerv- 
ous as cats with kittens. One of them 



92 



IF 




had a string of packhorses on a line 
and he saw me and called to an- 
other who seemed to be the leader. 
That one wheeled his black horse 
and rode back toward me. 

He was a middle-aged man, may- 
be as old as my Daddy. He was large 
and he had a hard face. Normal 
enough, but hard. He pulled to a 
halt when we reached each other, 
but I kept going. He had to come 
around and follow me. I believe in 
judging a person by his face. A man 
can’t help the face he owns, but he 
can help the expression he wears on 
it. If a man looks mean, I generally 
believe that he is. This one looked 
mean. That was why I kept riding. 

He said, “What be you doing out 
here, boy? Be you out of your head? 
There be escaped Losels in these 
woods.” 

I told you I hadn’t finished filling 
out yet, but I hadn’t thought it was 
that bad. I wasn’t ready to make a 
fight over the point, though. Gen- 
erally, I can’t keep my bloody 
mouth shut, but now I didn’t say 
anything. It seemed smart. 

“Where be you from?” he asked. 

I pointed to the road behind us. 

“And where be you going?” 

I pointed ahead. No other way 
to go. 

He seemed exasperated. I have 
that effect sometimes. Even on 
Mother and Daddy, who should 
know better. 

We were coming up on the others 
now, and the man said, “Maybe 
you’d better ride on from here with 
us. For protection.” 

He had an odd way of twisting 
his sounds, almost as though he had 

1>OWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN 



a mouthful of mush. I wondered 
whether he were just an oddball or 
whether everybody here spoke the 
same way. I’d never heard Inter- 
national English spoken any way but 
one, even on the planet Daddy 
made me visit with him. 

One of the other outriders came 
easing by then. I suppose they’d been 
watching us all the while. He called 
to the hard man. 

“He be awfully small, Horst. I 
doubt me a Losel’d even notice him 
at all. We mought as well throw 
him back again.” 

The rider looked at me. When I 
didn’t dissolve in terror as he ex- 
pected, he shrugged and one of the 
other men laughed. 

The hard man said to the others, 
“This boy will be riding along with 
us to Forton for protection.” 

I looked down at the plodding, 
unhappy creatures they were driving 
along and one looked back at me 
with dull, expressionless golden eyes. 
I felt uncomfortable. 

I said, “I don’t think so.” 

What the man did then surprised 
me. He said, “I do think so,” and 
reached for the rifle in his saddle 
boot. 

I whipped my sonic pistol out so 
fast that he was caught leaning over 
with the rifle half out. His jaw 
dropped. He knew what I held and 
he didn’t want to be fried. 

I said, “Ease your rifles out and 
drop them gently to the ground.” 
They did, watching me all the 
while with wary expressions. 

When all the rifles were on the 
ground, I said, “All right, let’s go.” 
They didn’t want to move. They 

93 




didn’t want to leave the rifles. I 
could see that. Horst didn’t say any- 
thing. He just watched me with nar- 
rowed eyes. But one of the others 
held up a hand and in wheedling 
tones said, “Look here, kid. 

“Shut up,” I said, in as mean a 
voice as I could muster, and he did. 
It surprised me. I didn’t think I 
sounded that mean. I decided he 
just didn’t trust the crazy kid not 
to shoot. 

After twenty minutes of easy rid- 
ing for us and hard walking for the 
creatures, I said, “If you want your 
rifles, you can go back and get them 
now.” I dug my heels into Nine’s 
sides and rode on. At the next bend I 
looked back and saw four of them 
holding their packhorses and the 
creatures still while one beat a dust- 
raising retreat down the road. 

I put this episode in the “file and 
hold for analysis” section in my mind 
and rode on, feeling good. I think 
I even giggled once. Sometimes I 
even convince myself that I’m hell 
on wheels. 

Ill 

TTI7hen I was nine, my Daddy 
gave me a painted wooden 
doll that my great-grandmother 
brought from Earth. The thing is 
that inside it, nestled one in another, 
are ejeven more dolls, each one 
smaller than the last. I like to watch 
people when they open it for the 
first time. 

My face must have been like that 
as I rode along the road. 

The country leveled into a great 
rolling valley and the trees gave way 

94 



to great farms and fields. In the 
fields, working, were some of the 
green creatures, which surprised me 
since the ones I’d seen before hadn’t 
seemed smart enough to count to 
one, let alone do any work. 

But it relieved me. I thought they 
might have been eating them or 
something. 

I passed two crossroads and 
started to meet more people, but 
nobody questioned me. I njet people 
on horsback, and twice I met 
trucks moving silently past. And I 
overtook a wagon driven by the 
oldest man I’ve seen in my life. He 
waved to me, and I waved back. 

Near the end of the afternoon I 
came to the town, and there I re- 
ceived a jolt that sickened me. 

By the time I came out on the 
other side, I was sick. My hands 
were cold and sweaty and my head 
was spinning, and I wanted to kick 
Nine to a gallop. 

I rode slowly in, looking all 
around, missing nothing. The town 
was all stone, wood and brick. Out 
of date. Out of time, really. There 
were no machines more complicated 
than the trucks I’d seen earlier. At 
the edge of town, I passed a news- 
paper office with a headline pasted 
in the window — INVASION! I 
remember that. I wondered about it. 

But I looked most closely at the 
people. In all that town, I didn’t 
see one girl over ten years old and 
no grown-up women at all. There 
were little kids, there were boys and 
there were men, but no girls. All 
the boys and men wore pants, and 
so did I, which must have been why 
Horst and his buddies assumed I was 

IE 




a boy. It wasn’t flattering; but I de- 
cided I’d not tell anybody different 
until I found what made the clocks 
tick on this planet. 

But that wasn’t what bothered 
me. It was the kids. My God! They 
swarmed. I saw a family come out 
of a house — a father and four 
children. It was the most foul thing 
I’ve ever seen. It struck me then — 
these people were Free Birthers! I 
felt a wave of nausea and I closed 
my eyes until it passed. 

T he first thing you learn in 
school is that if it weren’t for 
idiot and criminal people like these, 
Earth would never have been de- 
stroyed. The evacuation would never 
have had to take place, and eight 
billion people wouldn’t have died. 
There wouldn’t have been eight bil- 
lion people. But, no. They bred and 
they spread and they devoured 
everything in their path like a can- 
cer. They gobbled up all the re- 
sources that Earth had and crowded 
and shoved one another until the 
final war came. 

I am lucky. My great-great-grand- 
parents were among those who had 
enough foresight to see what was 
coming. If \t hadn’t been for them 
and some others like them, there 
wouldn’t be any humans left any- 
where. And I wouldn’t be here. That 
may not scare you, but it scares me. 

What happened before, when 
people didn’t use their heads and 
wound up blowing the Solar System 
apart, is something nobody should 
forget. The older people don’t let us 
forget. But these people had, and 
that the Council should know. 



For the first time since I landed 
on Tintera, I felt really frightened. 
There was too much going on that 
I didn’t understand. I felt a blind 
urge to get away, and when I reach- 
ed the edge of town, I whomped 
Nine a good one and gave him his 
head. 

I let him run for almost a mile 
before I pulled him down to a walk 
again. I couldn’t help wishing for 
Jimmy D. Whatever else he is, he’s 
smart and brains I needed. 

How do you find out what’s going 
on? Eavesdrop? That’s a lousy pieth- 
od. For one thing, people can’t be 
depended on to talk about the things 
you want to hear. For another, 
you’re likely to get caught. Ask 
somebody? Who? Make the mistake 
of bracing a fellow like Horst and 
you might wind up with a sore head 
and an empty pocket. The best 
thing I could think of was to find a 
library, but that might be a job. 

I’d had two bad shocks on this 
day, but they weren’t the last. In 
the late afternoon, when the sun 
was starting to sink and a cool wind 
was starting to ripple the tree leaves, 
I saw the scoutship high in the sky. 
The dying sun colored it a deep red. 
Back again? I wondered what had 
gone wrong. 

I reached down into my saddle- 
bag and brought out my contact 
signal. The scoutship swung up in 
the sky in a familiar movement cal- 
culated to drop the stomach out of 
everybody aboard. George Fuhon- 
in’s style. I triggered the signal, my 
heart turning flips all the while. I 
didn’t know why he was back, but 
I wasn’t really sorry. 



DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN 



95 




The ship swung around until it 
was coming back on a path almost 
over my head, going in the same di- 
rection. Then it went into a slip and 
started bucking so hard that I knew 
this wasn’t hot piloting at all, just 
plain idiot stutter-fingered stupidity 
at the controls. As it skidded by me 
overhead, I got a good look at it 
and knew that it wasn’t one of ours. 
Not too different, but not ours. 

One more enigma. Where was it 
from? Not here. Even if you know 
how, and we wouldn’t tell these 
Mud-eaters how, a scoutship is some- 
thing that takes an advanced tech- 
nology to build. 

I felt defeated and tired. Not 
much farther along the road, I 
came to a campsite with two wagons 
pulled in for the night, and I couldn’t 
help but pull in myself. The camp- 
site was large and had two perma- 
nent buildings on it. One was a well 
enclosure and the other was little 
more than a high-walled pen. It 
didn’t even have a roof. 

I set up camp and ate my dinner. 
In the wagon closest to me were a 
man, his wife and their three chil- 
dren. The kids were running around 
and playing, and one of them ran 
close to the high-walled pen. His 
father came and pulled him away. 

The kids weren’t to blame for 
their parents, but when one of them 
said hello to me, I didn’t even an- 
swer. I know how lousy I would feel 
if I had two or three brothers and 
sisters, but it didn’t strike me until 
that moment that it wouldn’t even 
seem out of the ordinary to these 
kids. Isn’t that horrible? 



About the time I finished eating, 
and before it grew dark, the old 
man I had seen earlier in the day 
drove his wagon in. He fascinated 
me. He had white hair, something I 
had read about in stories but had 
never seen before. 

When nightfall came, they started 
a large fire. Everybody gathered 
around. There was singing for 
awhile, and then the father of the 
children tried to pack them off to 
bed. But they weren’t ready to go, 
so the old man started telling them 
a story. In the old man’s odd accent, 
and sitting there in the campfire 
light surrounded by darkness, it 
seemed just right. 

It was about an old witch named 
Baba Yaga who lived in the forest 
in a house that stood on chicken 
legs. She was the nasty stepmother 
of a nice little girl, and to get rid of 
the kid, she sent her on a phony 
errand into the deep dark woods at 
nightfall. I could appreciate the 
poor girl’s position. All the little girl 
had to help her were the handker- 
chief, the comb and the pearl that 
she had inherited from her dear dead 
mother. But, as it turned out, they 
were just enough to defeat nasty 
old Baba Yaga and bring the girl 
safely home. 

I wished for the same for myself. 

The old man had just finished and 
they were starting to drag the kids 
off to bed when there was a com- 
motion on the road at the edge of 
the camp. I looked but my eyes were 
adjusted to the light of the fire and 
I couldn’t see far into the dark. 

A voice there said, "I’ll be damned 
if I’ll take another day like this one, 

IF 



96 




Horst. We should have been here 
hours ago. It be your fault we’re 
not.” 

Horst growled a retort. I decided 
that it was time for me to leave the 
campfire. I got up and eased away 
as Horst and his men came up to 
the fire, and cut back to where Nine 
was parked. I grabbed up my blan- 
kets and mattress and started to 
roll them up. I had a pretty good 
idea now what they used the high- 
walled pen for. 

I should have known that they 
would have to pen the animals up 
for the night. I should have used my 
head. I hadn’t and now it was time 
to take leave. 

I never got the chance. 

I was just heaving the saddle 
up on Nine when I felt a hand 
on my shoulder and I was swung 
around. 

“Well, well. Horst, look who we 
have here,” he called. It was the one 
who’d made the joke about me being 
beneath the notice of a Losel. He 
was alone with me now, but with 
that call the others would be up fast. 

I brought the saddle around as 
hard as I could and then up, and 
he went down. He started to get up 
again, so 1 dropped the saddle on 
him and reached inside my jacket for 
my gun. Somebody grabbed me then 
from behind and pinned my arms to 
my side. 

I opened my mouth to scream — 
I have a good scream — but a rough 
smelly hand clamped down over it 
before I had a chance to get more 
than a lungful of air. I bit down hard 
— 5000 lbs. psi, I’m told — but he 
DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN 



didn’t let me go. I started to kick, 
but Horst jerked me off my feet 
and dragged me off. 

When we were behind the pen 
and out of earshot of the fire, he 
stopped dragging me and dropped 
me in a heap. “Make any noise,” he 
said, “and I’ll hurt you.” 

That was a silly way to put it, 
but somehow it said more than if 
he’d threatened to break my arm 
or my head. It left him a latitude of 
things to do if he pleased. He ex- 
amined his hand. There was enough 
moonlight for that. “I ought to club 
you anyway,” he said. 

The one I’d dropped the saddle 
on came up then. The others were 
putting the animals in the pen. He 
started to kick me, but Horst 
stopped him. 

“No,” he said. “Look through the 
kid’s gear, bring the horse and what 
we can use.” 

The other one didn’t move. “Get 
going, Jack,” Horst said in a menac- 
ing tone and they stood toe to toe 
for a long moment before Jack fin- 
ally backed down. It seemed to me 
that Horst wasn’t so much objecting 
to me being kicked, but was rather 
establishing who did the kicking in 
his bunch. 

But I wasn’t done yet. I was 
scared, but I still had the pistol 
under my jacket. 

Horst turned back to me and I 
said, “You can’t do this and get 
away with it.” 

He said, “Look, boy. You may 
not know it, but you be in a lot of 
trouble. So don’t give me a hard 
time.” 

He still thought I was a boy. It 



97 




was not time to correct him, but I 
didn’t like to see the point go un- 
challenged. It was unflattering. 

“The courts won’t let you get 
away with this,” I said. I’d passed a 
courthouse in the town with a 
carved motto over the doors: 
EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER THE 
LAW or TRUTH OUR SHIELD 
AND JUSTICE OUR SWORD or 
something stuffy like that. 

He laughed, not a phony, villian- 
type laugh, but a real laugh, so I 
knew I’d goofed. 

“Boy, boy. Don’t talk about the 
courts. I be doing you a favor. I be 
taking what I can use of your gear, 
but I be letting you go. You go to 
court and they’ll take everything and 
lock you up besides. I be leaving you 
your freedom.” 

“Why would they be doing that?” 
I asked. I slipped my hand under 
my jacket. 

“Every time you open your mouth 
you shout that you be off one of 
the Ships,” Horst said. “That be 
enough. They already have one of 
you brats in jail in Forton.” 

I was about to bring my gun out 
when up came Jack leading Nine, 
with all my stuff loaded on. I men- 
tally thanked him. 

He said, “The kid’s got some good 
equipment. But I can’t make out 
what this, be for.” He held out my 
pickup signal. 

Horst looked at it, then handed 
it back. “Throw it away,” he said. 

I leveled my gun at them — Hell 
on Wheels strikes again! I said, 
“Hand that over to me.” 

Horst made a disgusted sound. 

“Don’t make any noise,” I said, 



“or you’ll fry. Now hand it over.” 
I stowed it away, then paused 
with one hand on the leather horn 
of the saddle. “What’s the name of 
the kid in jail in Forton.” 

“I can’t remember,” he said. “But 
it be coming to me. Hold on.” 

I waited. Then suddenly my arm 
was hit a numbing blow from behind 
and the gun went flying. Jack 
pounced after it and Horst said, 
“Good enough,” to the others who’d 
come up behind me. , 

I felt like a fool. 

Horst stalked over and got the 
signal. He dropped it on the ground 
and said in a voice far colder than 
mine could ever be, because it was 
natural and mine wasn’t, “The piece 
be yours.” Then he tromped on it 
until it cracked and fell apart. 

Then he said, “Pull a gun on me 
twice. Twice.” He slapped me so 
hard that my ears rang. “You dirty 
little punk.” 

I said calmly, “You big louse.” 

It was a time I would have done 
better to keep my mouth shut. All 
I can remember is a flash of pain 
as his fist crunched against the side 
of my face and then nothing. 

Brains are no good if you don’t 
use them. 

IV 

I remember pain and sickness, 
and motion, but my next clear 
memory is waking in a bed in a 
house. I had a feeling that time had 
passed but how much I didn’t know. 
I looked around and found the old 
man who had told the story sitting 
by my bed.

“How be you feeling this: mom- 
teg, young lady?” he asked He had 
white hair and a seamed face and 
tea hands were gnarled and old. His 
face was red, and the red and the 
white of his hair made a sharp con- 
trast with the bright blue of his deep- 
set eyes. It was a good face. 

“Not very healthy,” I said. “How 
long has it been?” 

“Two days,” he said. “You’ll get 
over it soon enough. I be Daniel 
Kutsov. And you?” 

“I’m Mia Havero.” 

“I found you dumped in a ditch 
after Horst Fanger and his boys had 
left you,” he said. “A very unpleas- 
ant man ... as I suppose he be 
bound to be, herding Losels.” 

“Those green things were Losels? 
Why are they afraid of them?” 

“The ones you saw beed drugged. 
They wouldn’t obey otherwise. Once 
in awhile a few be stronger than 
the drug and they escape to the 
woods. The drug cannot be so strong 
that they cannot work. So the 
strongest escape. They be some dan- 
ger to most people, and a great dan- 
ger to men like Horst Fanger who 
buy them from the ships. Every so 
often, hunters go out to thin them 
down.” 

“That seems like slavery,” I said, 
yawning. 

It was *a stupid thing to say, like 
some comment about the idiocy of 
a Free Birth policy. Not the senti- 
ment, but the timing. 

Mr. Kutsov treated the comment 
with more respect than it deserved. 
“Only God can decide a question 
like that,” he said gently. “Be it 
slavery to use my horses to work 



for me? I don’t know anyone who 
would say so. A man be a different 
matter, though. The question be 
whether a Losel be like a horse or 
like a man, and that I can’t answer. 
Now go to sleep again and in a 
while I will bring you some food.” 

He left then, but I didn’t go to 
sleep. I was in trouble. I had no 
way to contact the scoutship. There 
was only one way out, and that was 
to find somebody else who did have 
Ins signal. That wasn’t going to be 
easy. 

Mr. Kutsov brought me some 
food later in the day, and I asked 
him then, “Why are you doing all 
this for me?” 

He said, “I don’t like to see chil- 
dren hurt, by people like Horst Fan- 
ger or by anyone.” 

“But I’m from one of the Ships,” 
I said. “You know that, don’t you?” 

Mr. Kutsov nodded. “Yes, I know 
that.” 

“I understand that is pretty bad 
around here.” 

“With some people, true. But all 
the people who hate the Ships don’t 
realize that if it beedn’t for the 
Ships they wouldn’t be here at all. 
They hold their grudge too close 
to their hearts. There be some of 
us who disagree with the govern- 
ment though it has lost us our fami- 
lies or years from our lives, and we 
would not destroy what we cannot 
agree with. When such an one as 
Horst Fanger uses this as an excuse 
to rob and injure a child, I will not 
agree. He has taken all that you 
have and there is no way to reclaim 
it, but what I can give of my house 
be yours.”

I thanked him as best I could 
and then 1 asked him what the 
grudge was that they held against 
the Ships. 

“It ben’t a simple thing.” he said. 
“You have seen how poor and back- 
ward we be. We realize it. Now and 
again, when you decide to stop, we 
see you people from the Ships. And 
you ben’t poor or backward. You 
could call what we feel jealousy, if 
you wanted, but it be more than 
that and different. When we beed 
dropped here, there beed no scien- 
tists or technicians among us. I can 
understand. Why should they leave 
the last places where they had a 
chance to use and develop their 
knowledge for a backward planet 
where there is no equipment, no op- 
portunity? What be felt here be that 
all the men who survived the end 
of Earth and the Solar System be 
the equal heirs of man’s knowledge 
and accomplishment. But by bad 
luck, things didn’t work out that 
way. So ideas urged by the Ships be 
ignored, and the Ships be despised, 
and people from the Ships be treat- 
ed as shamefully as you have beed 
or worse.” 

I could think of a good example 
of an idea that the Ships emphasized 
that had been ignored. Only it was 
more than an idea or an opinion. 
It was a cold and deadly lesson 
taught by history. It was: Man be- 
comes an organism that ultimately 
destroys itself unless he regulates 
his own size and growth. That was 
what I was taught. 

I said, “I can understand how they 
might feel that way, but it’s not fair. 
We pretty much support ourselves. 
DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN 



As much as we can, we re-use things 
and salvage things, but we still need 
raw materials. The only thing we 
have to trade is knowledge. If we 
didn’t have anything to trade for 
raw materials, that would be the 
end of us. Do we have a choice?” 

“I don’t hold you to blame,” Mr. 
Kutsov said slowly, “but I can’t help 
but to feel that you have made a 
mistake and that it will hurt you in 
the end.” 

I didn’t say it, but I thought — 
when you lay blame, whom do you 
put it on? People who are obviously 
sick like these Mud-eaters, or people 
who are normal like us? 

After I got better, I had the run 
of Mr. Kutsov’s house. It was a 
small place near the edge of Forton, 
surrounded by trees and with a small 
garden. Mr. Kutsov made a regular 
shipping run through the towns to 
the coast and back every second 
week. It was not a profitable busi- 
ness, but he said that at his age, 
profit was no longer very important. 
He was very good to me, but I 
didn’t understand him. 

He gave me lessons before he let 
me go outside into the town. Wom- 
en were second class citizens around 
here, but prejudice of that sort 
wasn’t in Mr. Kutsov. Dressed as I 
was, as scrawny as I am, when 
people saw me here, they saw a 
boy. People see what they expect 
to see. I could get away with my 
sex, but not my accent. I might 
sound right on seven Ships and on 
111 other planets, but here I was 
wrong. And I had two choices — 
sound right or shut up. One of these 
choices was impossible for me, so I 



101 




®et out to learn to sound like a Tin- 
teran, born and bred, with Mr. 
Kutsov’s aid. 

It was a long time before he was 
willing to give me a barely passing 
grade. He said, “All right. You 
should keep listening to people and 
correcting yourself, but I be satis- 
fied. You talk as though you have 
a rag in your mouth, but I think you 
can get by.” 

Before I went out into town, I 
found out one more important 
thing. It was the answer to a ques- 
tion that I didn’t ask Mr. Kutsov. 
I’d been searching for it in old news- 
papers, and at last I found the story 
I was looking for. The last sentence 
read: “After sentencing, Denter- 

mount was sent to the Territorial 
Jail in Forton to serve his three- 
month term.” 

I thought, they misspelled his 
name. And then I thought, trust it 
to be Jimmy D. He gets in almost 
as much trouble as I do. 

T hough you may think it strange, 
my first stop was the library. 
I’ve found that it helps to be 
well-researched. 1 got what I could 
from Mr Kutsov’s books during the 
first days while he was outdoors 
working in his garden. In his library, 
I found a novel that he had written 
himself called The White Way. 

He said, “It took me forty years 
to write it, and I have spent forty- 
two years since living with the politi- 
cal repercussions. It has beed an in- 
teresting forty-two years, but I am 
not sure that 1 would do it again. 
Read the book if you be interested.” 
1 did read it, though I couldn’t 

102 



understand what the fuss was about. 
It seemed reasonable to me. But 
these Myd-eaters were crazy any- 
way. I couldn’t help but think that 
he and Daddy would have found a 
lot in common. They were both fine, 
tough-minded people, and though 
you would never know it to look at 
them, they were the same age. Ex- 
cept that at the age of eighty Mr. 
Kutsov was old, and at the age of 
eighty Daddy was not. 

It cost me an effort to walk 
through the streets of Forton, but 
after my third trip, the pain was 
less, though the number of children 
still made me sick. 

In the library, 1 spent four days 
getting a line on Tintera. I read 
their history. I studied their geog- 
raphy and, as sneakily as I could, 1 
tore out the best local maps I could 
find. 

On my trips through town, I took 
the time to look up Horst Fanger’s 
place of business. It was a house, a 
shed and pea for the Losels, a stable, 
a truck garage (one truck — brok- 
en down) and a sale block, all house 
in one rambling, shanty building. 
Mr. Horst Fanger was apparently 
a big man. Big deal. 

When I was ready, I scouted out 
the jail. It was a raw unpleasant 
day, the sort that makes me hate 
planets, and rain was threatening 
when I reached the jailpen. It was 
a solid three-story building of great 
stone blocks, shaped like a fortress 
and protected by bars, an iron-spike 
fence and two nasty-looking dogs. 
On my second trip around, the rain 
began. I beat it to the front and 
dodged in the entrance. 



IF 




I was standing there, shaking the 
rain off, when a man in a green 
uniform came stalking out of one 
of the offices that lined the first- 
floor hallway. My heart stopped for 
a moment, but he went right by 
without giving me a second look 
and went upstairs. That gave me 
some confidence and so I started 
poking around. 

I had covered ihe bulletin boards 
and the offices on one side of 
the hall when another man in 
green came into the hall and made 
straight for me. I didn’t wait, I 
walked toward him, too. I said, as 
wide-eyed and innocent as I could, 
“Can you help me, sir?” 

“Well, that depends. What sort of 
help do you need?” He was a big, 
rather slow man with one angled 
cloth bar on his shirt front over one 
pocket and a plate that said RO- 
BARDS pinned over the pocket on 
the other side. He seemed good- 
natured. 

I said, “Jerry had to write about 
the capital, and Jimmy got the Gov- 
ernor, and I got you ” 

“Hold on there. First, what be 
your name?” 

“Billy Davidow,” I said. “I don’t 
know what to write, sir, and I 
thought you could show me around 
and tell me things.” 

“I be sorry, son,” he said. “We be 
pretty caught up today. Could you 
make it some other afternoon or 
maybe some evening?” 

I said slowly, “I have to hand the 
paper in this week.” 

After a minute, he said, “All 
right. I’ll take you around. But I 



can’t spare much time. It’ll have to 
be a quick tour.” 

The offices were on the first floor. 
Storage rooms, an arms room and 
a target range were in the basement. 
Most of the cells were on the sec- 
ond floor, with the very rough cases 
celled on the third. 

“If the judge says maximum se- 
curity, they go on. the third, every- 
body else on the second unless wo 
have an overflow. Have a boy up- 
stairs now.” 

My heart sank. 

“A real bad actor. Killed a man." 

Well, that wasn’t Jimmy. Not 
with a three-month sentence. 

Maximum security had three set* 
of barred doors plus an armed 
guard. Sgt. Robards pointed it all 
out to me. “By this time next week, 
it will all be full in here,” he said 
sadly. “The Governor has ordered 
a round-up of all political agitators. 
The Anti-Redemptionists be getting 
out of hand and he be going to cool 
them off. Uh, don’t put that in your 
paper.” 

“Oh, I won’t,” I said, crossing off 
on my notes. 

The ordinary cells on the second 
floor weFe behind no barred doors 
and I got a guided tour. I stared 
Jimmy D. right in the face, but he 
had the brains to keep his mouth 
shut. 

When we had finished, I thanked 
Sgt. Robards enthusiastically. “It 
sure has been swell, sir.” 

“Not at all, son,” he said. “I en- 
joyed it myself. If you have time 
some evening, drop by when T have 
the duty. My schedule bees on the 
bulletin board.”

"Thank you, sir,” I said. "Maybe 
I will.” 

V 

B efore I scouted the jail I 
had only vague notions of what 
I was going to do to spring Jimmy 
D. I had spent an hour or so, for 
instance, toying with the idea of 
forcing the Territorial Governor to 
release Jimmy at the point of a gun. 
I spent that much time with it be- 
cause the idea was fun to think 
about, but I dropped it because it 
was stupid. 

I finally decided on a very simple 
course of action, one that could 
easily go wrong. It was my choice 
because it was the only thing I could 
pull off by myself that had a chance 
of working. 

Before I left the jail building, I 
copied down Sgt. Robards’ duty 
schedule from the bulletin board. 
Then I went home. 

I spent the next few days shop- 
lifting. Mr. Kutsov was laying in 
supplies, too, loading his wagon for 
his regular trip. I helped him load 
up, saving my shopping for my 
spare time. Mr. Kutsov wanted me 
to go along with him, but I couldn’t, 
of course, and I couldn’t tell him 
why. He didn’t want to argue and 
he couldn’t make me do anything 
I didn’t want to do, so I had an un- 
fair advantage. I just dug in my 
heels. 

Finally he agreed it was all right 
for me to stay alone in the house 
while he was gone. It was what I 
wanted, but I didn’t enjoy the pro- 
cess of getting my own way as much 



as I did at home. There it is a more 
even battle. 

The day he picked to leave was 
perfect for my purposes. Mr. Kut- 
sov said, “I’ll be back in six days. 
Be you sure that you will be all 
right?” 

I said, “Yes. I’ll be careful. You 
be careful, too.” 

“I don’t think it matters much any 
more at my age,” he smiled. “Stay 
out of trouble.” 

“I’ll try,” I said, and waved good- 
by. That was what I meant to do, 
stay out of trouble. 

Back in the house, I wrote a note 
of explanation for Mr. Kutsov and 
thanked him for all he had done. 
Then I dug my two small packs out 
of hiding and I was ready. 

I set out just after dark. It was 
sprinkling lightly, but I didn’t mind 
it. It surprised me, but I enjoyed 
the feel of the spray on my face. In 
one pocket I had pencil and paper 
for protective coverage. In another 
pocket I had a single sock and a 
roll of tape. 

Just before I got to the jail, I 
filled the sock with wet sand. 

Inside there were lights on in only 
two first floor offices. Sgt. Robards 
was in one of them. 

“Hello, Sgt. Robards,” I said, go- 
ing in. “How be you tonight?” 

“Well enough,” he said. “It be 
pretty slow down here tonight. They 
be busy up on the Third Floor to- 
night, though.” 

“Oh?” 

“They be picking up those Anti- 
Redemptionists tonight. How did 
your paper go?” 

“I handed it in,” I said. “I should 

IF 



104 




get a good grade with your help.” 
“Oh, you found out everything 
you needed to know.” 

“Oh, yes. I just came by to visit 
tonight. I wondered if you’d show 
me the target range again. That 
was keen.” 

“Sure,” he said. “Would you like 
to see me pop some targets? I be 
the local champion, you know.” 
“Gee, would you?” 

We went downstairs, Sgt. Robards 
leading the way. This was the place 
I’d picked to drop him. He was 
about to slip the key in the door to 
the range when I slugged him across 
the back of the neck with my sock 
full of sand. I grabbed him and 
eased him down. 

I tried the keys on either side 
of the target door key and 
opened the arsenal on the second 
try. I dragged him in there and got 
out my roll of tape I took three quick 
turns about his ankles, then did the 
same with his wrists. I finished by 
putting a bar and two crosspieces 
over the mouth. 

I picked out two weapons then. 
They had no sonics, of course, so I 
picked out two of the smallest and 
lightest pistols in the room. I figured 
out what cartridges fit them, and 
then dropped guns and cartridge 
clips into my pocket. 

I swung the door shut and locked 
it again, leaving Sgt. Robards inside. 
I stood for a moment in the corridor 
with the keys in my hand. There 
were only ten keys, not enough to 
cover each individual cell. Yet Sgt. 
Robards had clinked these keys and 
said that he could unlock the cells. 



Maybe I would have done better 
to stick up the Territorial Governor. 

Well, here goes. 

I eased up to the first floor. No- 
body came out of the second office 
to check on the noise made by my 
pounding heart, which surprised me. 
Then up to the second floor. It was 
dark here, but light from the first 
and third floors leaking up and down 
the stairs made things bright enough 
for me to see what I was doing. 
There were voices on the third floor 
and somebody laughed up there. I 
held my breath and moved quietly 
to Jimmy’s cell. 

I whispered, “Jimmy!” and he 
came alert and moved to the door. 

“Am I glad to see you,” he whis- 
pered back. 

I held up the keys. “Do any of 
these fit?” 

“Yes, the D key. The D key. It 
fits the four cells in this corner.” 

I fumbled through until I had the 
key tagged D. I opened the cell with 
as few clinking noises as possible. 
“Come on,” I said. “We’ve got to 
get out of here in a hurry.” 

He slipped out and pushed the 
door shut behind him. We headed 
for the stairs and were almost there 
when I heard somebody coming up. 
Jimmy must have heard it, too, be- 
cause he grabbed my arm and pulled 
me back. We flattened out as best 
we could. 

Talk about walking right into it! 
The policeman looked over at us 
and said, “What are you doing up 
here, Robards? Hey, you’re not. .” 

I stepped out and brought out one 
of the pistols. I said, “Easy now. If 
things go wrong for us, I have noth- 



DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN 



105 




ing to lose by shooting you. If you 
want to live, play it straight.” 

He apparently believed me, be- 
cause he put his hands where I 
could see them and shut up. 

I herded him into Jimmy’s cell 
and let Jimmy do the honors with 
the loaded sock. We taped him up 
and while Jimmy was locking him 
in, I heard somebody in one of the 
cells behind me say, “Shut up, there,” 
to somebody else. I turned and said, 
“Do you want to get shot?” 

The voice was collected. “No. No 
trouble here.” 

“Do you want to be let out?” 

The voice was amused. “I don’t 
think so. Thank you just the same.” 

Jimmy finished and I asked, 
“Where is your signal? We have to 
have that.” 

“In the basement with the rest of 
my gear.” 

The signal was all we took. When 
we were three blocks away and on 
a dark side street, I handed Jimmy 
his gun and ammunition. As he took 
them, he said, “Tell me something, 
Mia. Would you really have shot 
him?” 

I said. “I couldn't have. I hadn’t 
loaded my gun yet.” 

I led him through town follow- 
ing the back ways I’d worked 
out before. Somebody once said that 
good luck is no more nor less than 
careful preparation, and this time 
I meant to have good luck. I led 
Jimmy toward the Losel-selling dis- 
trict. 

Jimmy is short and red-headed 
with a face that makes him look 
about four years younger than he is. 

106 



That's a handicap any time. When 
you stand out anyway, it's likely to 
make you a little bit tart. But 
Jimmy’s all right most of the time. 
He said, “We’re in trouble.” 
“That’s brilliant.” 

“No,” Jimmy said. “They have a 
scoutship from one of the other 
Ships. This is going to sound wild, 
but they intend to use the scout to 
take over a Ship and then use that 
to destroy the rest of the Ships. 
They’re going to try. The police are 
rounding up everybody who is op- 
posed who has any influence and is 
putting them in jail.” 

“So what?” 

“Mia, are you mad at me for 
something?” 

“What makes you think so?” 
“You’re being bitter about some- 
thing.” 

“If you must know, it's that crack 
you made about me being a snob.” 
“That was a month ago.” 

“I still resent it.” 

“Why?” Jimmy asked. “It’s true. 
You think that because you're from 
a Ship that you’re automatically 
better than any Mud-eater. That 
makes you a snob.” 

“Well, you’re no better,” I said. 
“Maybe not, but I don’t pretend. 
Hey, look, we can't get anywhere if 
we fight and we’ve got to stick to- 
gether. I’ll tell you what. I’ll apolo- 
gize. I’m sorry I said it, even if it is 
true. Make up?” 

“Okay,” I said. But that was a 
typical trick of his. Get the last blow 
in and then call the whole thing off. 

When we got to Horst Fanger’s 
place, I said, “I’ve got our packs all 
set up. This is where ive get our 

IF 




horses.” I’d left this until last, not 
wanting people running around 
looking for stolen horses while I 
was trying to break somebody out 
of the police jail pen. Besides, for 
this I wanted somebody along as 
lookout. 

There was a fetid, unwashed odor 
that hung about the pens that the 
misting rain did nothing to dispel. 
We slipped by the pens, the Losels 
watching us but making no noise, 
and came to the stables, which 
smelled better. Jimmy stood guard 
while I broke the lock and slipped 
inside. 

Nine was there, good old Nincom- 
poop, and a quick search turned up 
his saddle as well. I saddled him up 
and then stood watch while Jimmy 
picked himself out a horse and gear. 
I did one last thing before I left. I 
took out the pencil and paper in my 
pocket and wrote in correct Inter E, 
in great big letters: I'M A GIRL , 
YOU STINKER. I hung it on a 
nail. It may have been childish, but 
it felt good. 

We rode from there to Mr. Kut- 
sov’s house, still following back 
alleys. As we rode, I told Jimmy 
about Mr. Kutsov and what he’d 
done for me. 

When we got there, we rode 
around to the back. 

“Hold the horses,” I said. “I’ll slip 
in and get the packs. They’re just 
inside.” 

We both dismounted and Jimmy 
took Nine’s reins. I bounded up the 
steps. 

Mr. Kutsov was waiting in the 
dark inside. He said, “I read your 
note.” 



“Why did you come back?” I 
asked. 

He smiled. “It didn’t seem right 
to leave you here by yourself. I be 
sorry. I think I underestimated you. 
Be that Jimmy Dentremont outside?” 

“You're not mad?” 

“No. I ben’t angry. I understand 
why you couldn’t tell me.” 

For some reason, I -started crying 
and couldn’t stop. The tears ran 
down my face. “I’m sorry,” I said. 
“I’m sorry.” 

The front door signal sounded 
then and Mr. Kutsov answered the 
door. A green-uniformed policeman 
stood in the doorway. “Daniel Kut- 
sov?” he asked. 

Instinctively, I shrank back out of 
sight of the doorway. I swiped at my 
face with my sleeve. 

Mr. Kutsov said, “Yes. What can 
I do for you.” 

The policeman moved one step 
inside the house where I could see 
him again. He said in a flat voice, 
“I have a warrant for your arrest.” 

T here was only one light on in 
the house, in the front room. 
From the shadows at the rear I 
watched them both. The policeman 
had a hard mask for a face, no 
more human than a Losel. Mr. Kut- 
sov was determined and I had the 
feeling that he had forgotten my 
presence. 

“To jail again? For my book?” 
He shook his head. “No.” 

“It be nothing to do with any 
book I know of, Kutsov. It be known 
that you be an Anti-Redemptionist. 
So come along.” He grasped Mr. 
Kutsov’s arm. 



DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN 



107 




Mr. Kutsov shook loose. “No. I 
won’t go to jail again. It be no 
crime to be against stupidity. I won’t 

*o” 

The policeman said “You be com- 
ing whether you want to or not. 
You be under arrest.” 

Mr. Kutsov’s voice had never 
shown his age before, but it shook 
now. “Get out of my house I” 

A sense of coming destruction 
grew on me as I saw the policeman 
lift his gun from its holster and say, 
“You be coming if I have to shoot.” 
Mr. Kutsov swung his fist at the 
policeman and missed and, as though 
the man could afford to let nothing 
pass without retaliation, he swung 
the barrel of his pistol dully against 
the side of Mr. Kutsov’s head. It 
rocked Mr. Kutsov, but he didn't 
fall. He raised his fist again. The 
policeman struck once more and 
waited but Mr. Kutsov still didn't 
fall. Instead, he swung again, and 
for the first time he landed, a blow 
that bounced weakly off the man’s 
shoulder. Almost inevitably, it seem- 
ed, the policeman raised his pistol 
and fired directly at Mr. Kutsov, 
and then again, and as the second 
report rang Mr. Kutsov slid to the 
floor. 

The silence was loud and gaunt. 
The policeman stood looking down 
at him and said, “Old foott” under 
his breath. Then he came to himself 
ancf looked around. Then he picked 
a candlestick off the table and 
dropped it with a thud by Mr. Kut- 
sov’s empty outstretched hand. 

The noise was a release tor me 
and I moved for the first time. The 
policeman grunted and looked up 

108 



and we stared at each other. Then 
again, slowly, he raised his gun and 
pointed it at me. 

I heard a snickering sound and the 
three reports rang out, one follow- 
ing another. The policeman stood 
for a moment, balanced himself and 
then, like a crumpled sheet of paper, 
he fell to the floor. I didn’t even look 
at Jimmy behind me. I started to 
cry and I went to Mr. Kutsov, pass- 
ing by the policeman without even 
looking at him. As I bent down be- 
side him, his eyes opened and he 
looked at me. 

I couldn’t stop crying. I held his 
head and cried. “I’m sorry,” I said. 
“I’m sorry.” 

He smiled and said faintly, but 
clearly, “It be all right.” After a 
minute he closed his eyes, and then 
he died. 

After another minute, Jimmy 
touched my arm and said, “There’s 
nothing we can do. Let’s leave now, 
Mia, while we still can.” 

Outside, it was still raining. Stand- 
ing in the rain I felt deserted. 

VI 

T he final morning on Tintera 
was a fine day. We and the 
horses were in a rock-enclosed aerie 
where we had dodged the day be- 
fore for shelter. In the aerie were 
grass and a small rock spring, and 
this day, the final day, was bright 
with blue and piled clouds riding 
high. 

From where we sat, looking from 
the top of the rock wall, we could 
see over miles of expanse. Lower 
hills and curving valleys all covered 

IF 




with a rolling carpet of trees, a 
carpet of varying shades of gray and 
green. There were some natural up- 
land meadows, and clearings in the 
valleys, and far away a line drawn 
in the trees that might be the path 
of a river. Down there, under that 
carpet, were all sorts of things — 
wild Losels, men hunting us, and — 
perhaps — some of the others from 
the Ship. We had seen the Losels 
and they had seen us; they had gone 
their way and we had gone ours. 
The men hunting us for blowing up 
their scoutship we hadn’t seen for 
four days, and even then they hadn’t 
seen us. As for the others, we hadn’t 
seen them at all. But they might be 
there, under the anonymous carpet. 

Jimmy got up from the ground 
and brushed himself off. He brought 
the signal over to me and said, 
“Should I. or do you want to?” 

“Go ahead,” I said. 

He triggered it. 

George Fuhonin was piloting and 
we were the sixth and seventh 
aboard. The other five crowded 
around and helped us put our gear 
away. Jimmy went on inside and I 
went upstairs to talk to George. 

I was up there by the time we 
were airborne. “Hello, Halfpint,” 
George said. 

“Hi, Georgie-Worgie,” I said, deal- 
ing blow for blow. “Have you had 
any trouble picking us up?” 

“No trouble yet. You trying to 
wish me problems?” 

“No,” I said. “This is a real nasty 
planet. They had Jimmy D. locked 
up in jail. They hate everybody from 
the Ships.” 

“Oh.” George raised his eyebrows. 



“Well, that might explain the board.” 
He pointed to the board of lights 
above and to his left. Twenty-nine 
were marked for the twenty-nine of 
us. Of the twenty-nine, only twelve 
were lit. “The last light came on 
two hours ago. If there aren't any 
more, this will be the most fatal 
Triafl Group I’ve ever picked up.” 

I stayed' upstairs .through two 
more pickups. Joe Fernandez-Frago- 
so, and then another double of 
which Venie Morlock was one half. 
T went downstairs to say hello to 
her: 

"ITire were just settling down 

* ^ when George set off the 
alarm. He was speaking in the elder 
brother tone that I can’t stand. 

“All right, kids — shut up and 
listen. One of our people is down 
there. I didn’t get close enough to 
see who. Whoever it is is surround- 
ed by some of the local peasantry 
and we’ve got to bust him out. I’m 
going to buzz down and try to land 
on some of them. Then I want all of 
you outside and laying down a cov- 
ering fire. Got that? I’m starting on 
down now.” 

Some of the kids had their weap- 
ons with them, but Jimmy and I 
didn’t. We hopped for the gear 
racks and got out our pistols. There 
were ten of us and four ramps to 
the outside. Jimmy and I had No. 3 
to ourselves. George is a hotrodder, 
as Tve said, and after he gave us a 
long moment to get in place, he 
started down, a stomach-heaving 
swoop. Then he touched down light 
as a feather and dropped the ramps. 

Jimmy and I dived down the 



DOWN TO THE WORLDS OF MEN 



109 




ramp and I went left and he went 
right. We were on a slight slope 
facing down and my momentum and 
the slant put me right where I want- 
ed to be — flat on my face. I rolled 
behind a tree and looked over to 
see Jimmy almost hidden in a bush. 

Here, hundreds of miles from 
where we had been picked up, it 
was misting under a familiar rolled 
gray sky. In my ears was the sound 
of gunfire from the other side of 
the ship and from below us. Our 
boy was pinned fifty yards down 
the slope behind some rocks that 
barely protected him. He was fight- 
ing back. I could see the sighting 
beam of his sonic pistol slapping 
out. About thirty feet away from 
him toward us was the body of his 
horse. I recognized him then — a 
meatball named Riggy Allen. 

I took all this in in seconds, and 
then I raised my pistol and fired, 
aiming at his attackers. They were 
dug in behind trees and rocks, at 
least partly hidden from Riggy as 
he was hidden from them. From 
where we were, though, above and 
looking down, they could be picked 
out. The distance was too great for 
my shot and it plowed up earth ten 
feet short, but the man I aimed at 
ducked back behind cover. 

There was a certain satisfaction 
in one of these guns. Where a sonic 
pistol is silent, these made enough 
noise that you knew you were doing 
something. And when you missed 
with a sonic pistol, all you could ex- 
pect at most was a shriveled branch 
or a sere and yellow leaf, but a miss 
with this gun could send up a gout 
of earth or drive a hole in a tree 



big enough to scare the steadiest 
man you can find. 

I aimed higher and started to loft 
my shots in. Jimmy was doing the 
same thing, and the net effect was 
to keep their heads down. Riggy fin- 
ally got the idea after a long moment. 
He stood up and started racing up the 
hill. Then my gun clicked empty, and 
a second later the firing to my right 
stopped. I started to fumble for an- 
other clip. 

As our fire stopped, those heads 
popped back up again and took in 
the situation. They began to fire 
again and our boy Riggy took a long 
step and then dived over the body of 
his horse and went flat. 

I n a moment I was firing again, 
and then Jimmy was, too, and 
Riggy was up and running again. 
Then I started thinking clearly and 
held my fire while Jimmy emptied 
his clip. The instant he stopped, I 
started again, a regular squeeze, 
squeeze, squeeze. As I finished, 
Jimmy opened with his new clip and 
then Riggy was past us and up the 
ramp. He went flat in the doorway 
there and started firing his sonic 
pistol; its range was greater than 
our peashooters and he hosed the 
whole area down while Jimmy and 
I sprinted for the ramp. 

As we hit the inside of the ship, 
I yelled, “Raise No. 3!” George had 
either been watching or listening, 
because it lifted smoothly up and 
locked in place. 

Shots were still coming from the 
other sides of the ship, so I yelled 
at Jimmy to go left. Riggy just stood 
there for a moment fuzzy-headed, 

IF 



110 




but Jimmy gave him a shove to the 
right and he finally got the idea. I 
cut through the middle. In the door- 
way of No. 1, I skidded flat on my 
face again and looked for targets. I 
dropped all my clips in front of me 
and began to fire. When the clip 
was empty, in two quick motions I 
pulled out the old one and slapped 
in the new and fired again. The 
three I was covering for used their 
heads and slipped in one at a time. 

As the second one came aboard, 
I heard Jimmy’s voice call to raise 
No, 2 from my left. My third was 
Venie Morlock and as she ran 
aboard, I couldn’t resist tripping her 
flat. I yelled to George to raise No. 1. 

Venie glared at me and demand- 
ed, “What was that for?” as the 
ramp swung up. 

“Just making sure you didn’t get 
shot,” I said, lying. 

A second later, Riggy yelled that 
his side was okay and the last ramp 
was raised. My last view of Tintera 
was of a rainsoaked hillside and 
men doing their best to kill us, 
which all seems appropriate some- 
how. As the last ramp locked in 
place, George lifted the ship again 
and headed for the next pickup. 



I went over to say hello to Riggy. 
He’d been completely unhurt by the 
barrage, but he had a great gash on 
his arm that was just starting to heal. 
He said that he was minding hit 
own business in the woods one day 
when a Losel jumped out from bo- 
hind a bush and slashed him. That 
may sound reasonable to you, but 
you don’t know Riggy. I do. My 
opinion is that it was probably the 
other way around — the Losel was 
walking along in the woods one day, 
minding his own business, when 
Riggy jumped out from a bush and 
scared him. That is the sort of thing 
Riggy is inclined to do. 

Riggy had been sneaking a look 
at my gun, and now he said, “Where 
did you get that neat pistol? Let me 
see it.” 

I handed it over. 

After a minute of inspection, 
Riggy asked, “You wouldn’t want to 
trade, would you?” 

“For your sonic pistol?” 

“Yes. You want to?” 

I considered it for a minute, and 
then I said, “All right,” and we 
traded. There is a certain amount 
of satisfaction in shooting an antique 
like that, but I know which is the

more effective weapon. Besides, I 
only had one full clip of ammunition 
left. 

T here is a certain amount of 
prestige in coming back alive 
from Survival. It’s your key to 
adulthood. There were no brass 
bands waiting for us when we got 
back, but our families were there, 
and that was enough. 

The fifteen of us went down the 
lowered ramp, and when I stood 
again on solid rock, I looked around 
that ugly, bare scout bay and just 
drank it in. Home. 

I turned to Jimmy then and I 
said, “Jimmy, it’s a relief to be back, 
isn’t it? And that isn’t snobbery. It 
might have been before, but I don’t 
think I am now.” 

And Jimmy nodded. 

The waiting room wasn’t bare. 
They had the decorations up for 
Year End, colored mobiles with 



lights that ranged through the spec- 
trum, and more decorations on the 
walls. In the crowd of people wait- 
ing for us, I saw Jimmy’s mother 
and her present husband, and Jim- 
my’s father and his wife. When they 
saw Jimmy, they started waving 
and shouting. 

Just as I said, “I’ll see you to- 
night,” I saw Mother and Daddy 
standing off to one side, and I 
waved. It was as though I had left 
the real world entirely* for a month, 
and now at last I was back where 
things were going on and I wasn’t 
missing a thing. I ran to them and 
I kissed Mother and hugged Daddy. 
Mother was crying. 

I leaned back in Daddy’s arms 
and looked up at him. He put a 
measuring hand over my head and 
said, “Mia, I believe you’ve grown 
some.” 

It might be so. I felt taller.

MEN OF SPACE 

BY THEODORE STURGEON 



Men of Space; 

by Shirley Thomas. 5 volumes (so far). 
Chilton Co., Philadelphia; Each 230 to 
300 pp. f king-sized (6 x 9*4-). Indexed and 
illustrated. Each $4.95. 

N ow here’s a set of books it’s easy 
to throw rocks at. It’s big, 
glossy and authored by a lady with 
more than trace amounts of Wide- 
eye and Gush. Tt’s big, and most ir- 
ritatingly peopled by men who, ab- 
solutely and unnaturally without ex- 
ception, are dedicated, fearless, pa- 
triotic, brilliant and visionary — to the 
point where you’d weep for joy at a 
single small mention of a wart or a 
pair of dirty feet or a touch of greed. 
It’s big . and utterly uncricitcal of 
the moral posture, the philosophies 
and the political convictions of its 
subjects. Most of all, it’s an easy 
target . it’s so big. 

Be it known at this point that 
we’ve thrown all the rocks we’re go- 
ing to throw. We further depose and 
say that the above carping has to be 
modified in every particular. If Miss 
Thomas exhibits gush, it is not in 
much more than trace amounts. As 



to the* rest, they are purely destruc- 
tive criticisms. What the alternatives 
would, be to the uncritical approach 
in a work of this kind, we simply 
can’t imagine. And a writer who 
wouldn’t, on occasion fall into hy- 
perbole when handling such a sub- 
ject would have no soul and negli- 
gible glands. For — it’s big. 

Big as space. Big as human dog- 
gedness and human aspiration. And 
if you don’t rise to these for them- 
selves, the books have something 
else that’s very special. 

First, a simple statement of what 
Miss Thomas has set out to do. Back 
of the spacemen are the space-men, 
just as a pilot is only the apex of a 
widening spearhead of crew, ground- 
crew, maintenance, field operations, 
manufacture and design personnel. 
Shepard, Glenn, Gagarin, Crossfield 
are names which readily come to 
mind in the spaceman category, and 
behind them, everyone knows, are 
von Braun, Teller, Doolittle, Pierce. 
Now, how freely can you identify 
Kantrowitz, Flickinger, Ramo and 
Toftoy? 



113 



The Glenns and the von Brauns 
would be the first to say — and have 
said -that without these others, the 
space effort would be nothing at all, 
nor would they themselves be any- 
thing but anonymous (and probably 
angry). 

Overwhelmed at first by the sheer 
size of the volumes and their sub- 
jects, the reader will skim through 
some of the names and events he 
knows — and will suddenly find he 
now knows more than he did. He 
then wets a toe in a Truax or a 
Townes (who he?) and, before he 
knows it, he’s nostril deep in the tor- 
rent. 

Mrs. Thomas does her homework. 
Her usual format is some sort of 
narrative hook, a few paragraphs of 
refresher material (reminding you 
what you vaguely remember about 
this or that device or development — 
satellite tracking or Dyna-Soar), 
then an account of how it was 
brought about and finally a biogra- 
phy of the man himself, with a very 
genuine effort to understand what 
shaped the man to this particular 
end. 

It is in the body of each narrative, 
the part which explains what it is 
the man did, that Miss Thomas gives 
you that something special we men- 
tioned above. If she is going to tell 
you who invented the travelling 
wave tube* (which she does) she will 
tell you what it is, what it’s for, 
how it works and what it means. She 
does it clearly and lucidly and as 
accurately as a non-scientific vocab- 
ulary can manage. And you find 
yourself — perhaps even in spite of 
yourself — gradually oiling your irri- 



tations with the balm of wonder, as 
she uses her really remarkable abil- 
ity to translate technicalities into 
meaningful American. Sometimes 
even she has her hands full, as in her 
determined effort to convey to you 
the essence of Samuel Herrick’s 
paper, Step-by-Step Integration of 
x=f(x,y,z,t ) Without a Corrector or 
A Modification of the te Variation of 
Constants ” Method for Special Per- 
turbations; but by golly, she makes 
it; and you find it’s important and 
germane, for Samuel Herrick is the 
tracker supreme — a man who out 
of his own talent and curiosity made 
a practical discipline out of the prob- 
lem of locating bodies in orbit. As 
a young man, already deeply inter- 
ested, he wrote to the only authority 
he knew of for guidance. “ ... as 
far as I know, no courses (are) giv- 
en anywhere on the subject,” an- 
swered Dr. Robert H. Goddard . 

Let us, for sampling, take Vol. 3 
from the top. It has an impressive 
imprimatur , as have they all; the 
advisory board for the series is Lt. 
Gen. (U.S.A.F.) Donald Putt, Sen- 
ator Styles Bridges Dr. E. M. Em- 
me (N.A.S.A. historian), M. W. 
MacFarlane (Guggenheim Chair of 
Aeronautics, Library of Congress), 
Capt. Grayson Merril, USN, Dr. F. 
Sorenson, U. of Nebraska, Sen. Stu- 
art Symington and Dr. E. C. Walsh, 
(Exec. Sec., N.A.S.A.). The fore- 
word is by General Schreiver, AF 
Systems Command, the preface by 
Captain Merril. The biographies are: 

James H. Doolittle; C. Stark Dra- 
per, M.I.T., instrumentation and 
guidance; Louis G. Dunn, r&d man 
for Atlas, Thor, Titan and Minute- 



IU 



IF 




man; Don D. Flickinger, space med- 
icine; Yuri Gagarin; Arthur Kan- 
trowitz, nose-cones and re-entry; Ad- 
miral Raborn, the Polaris man; Har- 
old W. Ritchey, solid fuel developer 
— X-\l , Nike, Hercules; Alan Shep- 
ard; and H. N. Toftoy, who origin- 
ated “Paperclip”, the effort that 
brought German rocket scientists to 
the U.S. after the war, and then 
sparked Redstone and Jupiter. Then 
the index; and in the middle is a 
photographic section, covering each 
of these men and/or his work. 

Let us stress again that these are 
not Who’s-Who type thumbnail 
sketches. In every case, Miss Thomas 
has researched the man’s work as 
well as the man, and she just won’t 
let go until she understands it and 
then does the same for you. And 
this, in the long run, is the true 
value of these books. But if you’re 
at all interested in space — and it 
would be hard to imagine that you 
weren’t, or you wouldn’t be reading 
this particular page — you’ll see the 
huge advantage in having, in one 
package, an indexed treasure-trove 
of readily understandable space sub- 



jects — practically anything you can 
think of — history, biography, fuels, 
guidance systems, tracking, nuclear- 
and thermo-nuclear energy, astro- 
physics and -dynamics and -mechan- 
ics and just plain -nomy, and any- 
thing else you can think of and a lot 
you won’t until you spin through 
those indexes. 

And don’t let that heavy price 
tag throw you. Go down to your 
public library and ask them to put 
in the set, and keep the new ones 
on order. Not so much to get defin- 
itive and complete information on 
all these sciences and disciplines, but 
to get enough of a grasp of them to 
enable you to go on to more spe- 
cialized reading. And don’t be sur- 
prised if the librarian and the Book 
Committee, or whatever setup your 
library has, eagerly buys the books 
for you. It happens* that we are on 
the Book Committee of our local 
library, and can attest how wonder- 
ful it is when the public requests 
something which doesn’t happen to 
be on the glop-of-the-month folder, 
or the breast-seller list.

THE 

SHADOW OF WINGS 



BY ROBERT SILVERBERG 

ILLUSTRATED BY FINLAY 

The alien came as a friend. 

He could not help looking 
like man’s ultimate Enemy! 



T he children came running to- 
ward him, laughing and shout- 
ing, up from the lakeside to the 
spot on the grassy hill where he lay 
reading; and as Dr. John Donald- 
son saw what was clutched in the 
hand of his youngest son, he felt an 
involuntary tremor of disgust. 

“Look, John! Look what Paul 
caught!” That was his oldest, Jo- 
anne. She was nine, a brunette rap- 
idly growing tan on this vacation 
trip. Behind her came David, eight, 
fair-haired and lobster-skinned, and 
in the rear was Paul, the six-year- 
old, out of breath and gripping in 



his still pudgy hand a small green 
frog. 

Donaldson shoved his book — 
Haley, Studies in Morphological 
Linguistics — to one side and sat 
up. Paul thrust the frog almost into 
his face. “I saw it hop, John — and 
I caught it!” He pantomimed the 
catch with his free hand. 

“I saw him do it,” affirmed David. 

The frog’s head projected be- 
tween thumb and first finger; two 
skinny webbed feet dangled free at 
the other end of Paul’s hand, while 
the middle of the unfortunate ba- 
trachian was no doubt being pain-

IF 



fully compressed by the small clam- 
my hand. Donaldson felt pleased by 
Paul’s display of coordination, un- 
usual for a six-year-old. But at the 
same time he wished the boy would 
take the poor frog back to the lake 
and let it go. 

“Paul,” he started to say, “you 
really ought to — ” 

The direct-wave phone at the far 
end of the blanket bleeped, indicat- 
ing that Martha, back at the bun- 
galow, was calling. 

“It’s Mommy,” Joanne said. Some- 
how they had never cared to call 
her by her first name, as they did 
him. “See what she wants, John.” 

Donaldson sprawled forward and 
activated the phone. 

“Martha?” 

“John, there’s a phone-call for 
you from Washington. I told them 
you were down by the lake, but they 
say it’s important and they’ll hold 

__ M 

on 

Donaldson frowned. “Who from 
Washington?” 

“Caldwell, he said. Bureau of 
Extraterrestrial Affairs. Said it was 
urgent.” 

Sighing, Donaldson said, “Okay. 
I’m coming.” 

He looked at Joanne and said, as 
if she hadn’t heard the conversation 
at all, “There’s a call for me and I 
have to go to the cottage to take it. 
Make sure your brothers don’t go 
into the water while I’m gone. And 
see that Paul lets that confounded 
frog go.” 

Picking up his book, he levered 
himself to his feet and set out for 
the phone in the bungalow at a brisk 
trot. 



C aldwell’s voice was crisp and 
efficient and not at all apolo- 
getic as he said, “I’m sorry to have 
to interrupt you during your vaca- 
tion, Dr. Donaldson. But it’s an ur- 
gent matter and they tell us you’re 
the man who can help us.” 

“Perhaps I am. Just exactly what 
is it r you want?” 

“Check me if I’m wrong on the 
background. You re Professor of 
Linguistics at Columbia, a student 
of the Kethlani languages and au- 
thor of a study of Kethlani linguis- 
tics published in 2087.” 

“Yes, yes, that’s all correct. 
But — ” 

“Dr. Donaldson, we’ve captured 
a live Kethlan. He entered the Sys- 
tem in a small ship and one of our 
patrol vessels grappled him in, ship 
and all. We’ve got him here in 
Washington and we want you to 
come talk to him.” 

For an instant Donaldson was too 
stunned to react. A live Kethlan? 
That was like saying, We’ve found a 
live Sumerian, or. We’ve found a live 
Etruscan. 

The Kethlani languages were pre- 
cise, neat and utterly dead. At one 
time in the immeasurable past the 
Kethlani had visited the Solar Sys- 
tem. They had left records of their 
visit on Mars and Venus, in two 
languages. One of the languages 
was translatable, because the Mar- 
tians had translated it into their 
own, and the Martian language was 
still spoken as it had been a hundred 
thousand years before. 

Donaldson had obtained his doc- 
torate with what was hailed as a 
brilliant Rosetta Stone type analysis 

IF 



118 




of the Kethlani language. But a 
live Kethlan? Why — 

After a moment he realized he 
was staring stupidly at his unevenly- 
tanned face in the mirror above the 
phone cabinet, and that the man on 
the other end of the wire was mak- 
ing impatient noises. 

Slowly he said, “I can be in Wash- 
ington this afternoon, I guess. Give 
me some time to pack up my things. 
You won’t want me for long, will 
you?” 

“Until we’re through talking to 
the Kethlan,” Caldwell said. 

“All right,” Donaldson said. “I 
can take a vacation any time. Keth- 
lani don’t come along that often.” 
He hung up and peered at his 
face in the mirror. He had had 
curly reddish hair once, but fifteen 
years of the academic life had worn 
his forehead bare. His eyes were 
mild, his nose narrow and unem- 
phatic, his lips thin and pale. As he 
studied himself, he did not think he 
looked very impressive. He looked 
professorial. That was to be ex- 
pected. 

“Well?” Martha asked. 

Donaldson shrugged. “They cap- 
tured some kind of alien spaceship 
with a live , one aboard. And it 
seems I’m the only person who can 
speak the language. They want me 
right away.” 

“You’re going?” 

“Of course. It shouldn’t take more 
than a few days. You can manage 
with the children by yourself, can’t 
you? I mean — ” 

She smiled faintly, walked around 
behind him and kneaded the muscle 
of his sun-reddened back in an af- 



fectionate gesture. “I know better 
than to argue,” she said. “We can 
take a vacation next year.” 

He swiveled his left hand behind 
his back, caught her hand and 
squeezed it fondly. He knew she 
would never object. After all, his 
happiness was her happiness — • and 
he was never happier than when 
working in his chosen field. The 
phone-call today would probably 
lead to all sorts of unwanted and 
unneeded publicity for him. But it 
would also bring him academic suc- 
cess, and there was no denying the 
genuine thrill of finding out how ac- 
curate his guesses about Kethlani 
pronunciation were. 

“You’d better go down to the 
lake and get the children,” he said. 
“I’ll want to say good-by before I 
leave.” 

T hey had the ship locked in a 
stasis-field in the basement of 
the Bureau of E-T Affairs Building, 
on Constitution Avenue just across 
from the National Academy of 
Sciences. The great room looked 
like nothing so much as a crypt, 
Donaldson thought as he entered. 
Beam-projectors were mounted 
around the walls, focussing a golden 
glow on the ship. Caught in the 
field, the ship hovered in midair, 
a slim, strange-looking torpedo-like 
object about forty feet long and ten 
feet across the thickest place. A 
tingle rippled up Donaldson’s spine 
as he saw the Kethlani cursives 
painted in blue along the hull. He 
translated them reflexively: Bringer 
of Friendship. 

“That’s how we knew it was a 

119 



THE SHADOW OF WINGS 




Ketblani ship,” Caldwell said, at his 
side. He was a small, intense man 
who hardly reached Donaldson’s 
shoulder; he was Associate Director 
of the Bureau, and in his superior’s 
absence he was running the show. 

Donaldson indicated the projec- 
tors. “How come the gadgetry? 
Couldn’t you just sit the ship on the 
floor instead of floating it that 
way?” 

“That ship’s heavy,” Caldwell said. 
“Might crack the floor. Anyway, it’s 
easier to maneuver this way. We can 
raise or lower the ship, turn it, float 
it in or out of the door.” 

“I see,” Donaldson said. “And you 
say there’s a live Kethlan in there?” 

Caldwell nodded. He jerked a 
thumb toward a miniature broad- 
casting station at the far end of the 
big room. “We’ve been in contact 
with him. He talks to us and we 
talk to him. But we don’t under- 
stand a damned bit of it, of course. 
You want to try?” 

Donaldson shook his head up and 
down in a tense affirmative. Cald- 
well led him down to the radio set, 
where an eager-looking young man 
in military uniform sat making ad- 
justments. 

Caldwell said, “This is Dr. Don- 
aldson of Columbia. He wrote the 
definitive book on Kethlani lang- 
uages. He wants to talk to our friend 
in there.” 

A microphone was thrust into 
Donaldson’s hands. He looked at it 
blankly, then at the pink face of 
the uniformed man, then at the ship. 
The inscription was in Kethlani. A 
language, for which Donaldson was 
grateful. There were two Kethlani 
120 



languages, highly dissimilar, which 
he had labeled A and B. He knew 
his way around in A well enough, 
but his mastery of Kethlani B was 
still exceedingly imperfect. 

“How do I use this thing?” 

“You push the button on the 
handle, and talk. That’s all. The 
Kethlan can hear you. Anything he 
says will be picked up here.” He in- 
dicated a tape-recorder and a speak- 
er on the table. 

D onaldson jabbed down on the 
button, and, feeling a strange 
sense of disorientation, uttered two 
words in greeting in Kethlani A. 

The pronunciation, of course, was 
sheer guesswork. Donaldson had 
worked out what was to him a con- 
vincing Kethlani phonetic system, 
but whether that bore any relation 
to fact remained to be seen. 

He waited a moment. Then the 
speaker emitted a series of harsh, 
unfamiliar sounds — and, buried in 
them like gems in a kitchen-midden, 
Donaldson detected familiar-sound- 
ing words. 

“Speak slowly,” he said in Keth- 
lani A. “I ... have only a few 
words.” 

The reply came about ten sec- 
onds later, in more measured ac- 
cents. “How . do . you . 
speak our language?” 

Donaldson fumbled in his small 
vocabulary for some way of ex- 
plaining that he had studied Keth- 
lani documents left behind on Mars 
centuries earlier, and compared them 
with their understandable Martian 
translations until he had pried some 
sense out of them. 



IF 




He glimpsed the pale, sweat-bead- 
ed faces of the E-T men around him; 
they were mystified, wondering what 
he was saying to the alien but not 
daring to interrupt. Donaldson felt 
a flash of pity for them. Until today 
the Bureau had concerned itself with 
petty things: import of Martian an- 
tiquities, study visas for Venus, and 
the like. Now, suddenly, they found 
themselves staring at an extra-solar 
spaceship, and . all the giant prob- 
lems that entailed. 

“Find out why he came to the 
Solar System,” Caldwell whispered. 

“I’m trying to,” Donaldson mur- 
mured with some irritation. He said 
in Kethlani, “You have made a long 
journey.” 

“Yes. and alone.” 

“Why have you come?” 

There was a long moment of si- 
lence; Donaldson waited, feeling 
tension of crackling intensity start- 
ing to build within him. The unreality 
of the situation obsessed him. He 
had been fondly confident that he 
would never have the opportunity to 
speak actual Kethlani, and that con- 
fidence was being shattered. 

Finally: “I . have come . 
why?” 

The inversion was grammatical- 
ly correct. “Yes,” Donaldson said. 
“Why?” 

Another long pause. Then the 
alien said something which Don- 
aldson did not immediately under- 
stand. He asked for a repeat. 

It made little sense — but, of 
course, his Kethlani vocabulary was 
a shallow one, and he had addition- 
al difficulty in comprehending be- 
cause he had made some mistakes 
THE SHADOW OF WINGS 



in interpreting vowel values when 
constructing his Kethlani phonetics. 

But the repeat came sharp and 
clear, and there was no mistaking it: 

“I do ... do not like to talk this 
way. Come inside my ship and we 
will talk there.” 

i^TX^hat’s he saying?” Caldwell 
* * prodded. 

Shaken, Donaldson let the mike 
dangle from limp fingers. “He 
— he says he wants me to come in- 
side the ship. He doesn’t like long- 
distance conversations.” 

Caldwell turned at a right angle 
and said to a waiting assistant, “All 
right. Have Mathews reverse the 
stasis-field and lower the ship. We’re 
going to give the Kethlan some 
company.” 

Donaldson blinked. “Company? 
You mean you’re sending me in 
there?” 

“I sure as hell do mean that. The 
Kethlan said it’s the only way he’d 
talk, didn’t he? And that’s what 
you’re here for. To talk to him. So 
why shouldn’t you go in there, eh?” 

“Well — look, Caldwell, suppose 
it isn’t safe?” 

“If I thought it was risky, I 
wouldn’t send you in,” Caldwell said 
blandly. 

Donaldson shook his head. “But 
look — I don’t want to seem coward- 
ly, but I’ve got three children to 
think about. I’m not happy about 
facing an alien being inside his own 
ship, if you get me.” 

“I get you,” said Caldwell tiredly. 
“All right. You want to go home? 
You want to call the whole business 
off right here and now?” 



121 




“Of course not. But — ” 

“But then you’ll have to go in.” 
“How will I be able to breathe?” 
“The alien air is close enough 
to our own. He’s used to more car- 
bon dioxide and less oxygen, but he 
can handle our air. There's no prob- 
lem. And no risk. We had a man in 
there yesterday when the Kethlan 
opened the outer lock. You won’t be 
in any physical danger. The alien 
won’t bother you.” 

“1 hope not,” Donaldson said. He 
felt hesitant about it; he hadn’t bar- 
gained on going inside any extra 
solar spaceships. But they were 
clustered impatiently around him, 
waiting to send him inside, and he 
didn’t seem to have much choice. 
He sensed a certain contempt for 
him on their faces already. He didn’t 
want to increase their distaste. 
“Will you go in?” Caldwell asked. 
“All right. All right. Yes. I’ll go 
in.” 

Nervously Donaldson picked up 
the microphone and clamped a cold 
finger over the control-button. 

“Open your lock,” he said to the 
alien being. “I’m coming inside.” 

'"T'here was a moment’s delay while 
the stasis-field projectors were 
reversed, lowering the ship gently to 
floor level. As soon as it touched, a 
panel in the gleaming golden side of 
the ship rolled smoothly open, re- 
vealing -an inner panel. 

Donaldson moistened his lips, 
handed the microphone to Caldwell 
and walked uncertainly forward. He 
reached the lip of the airlock, 
stepped up over it, and into the ship. 
Immediately the door rolled shut be- 
122 



hind him, closing him into a chamber 
about seven feet high and four feet 
wide, bordered in front and back by 
the outer and inner doors of the 
lock. 

He waited. Had he been claustro- 
phobic he would have been hysteri- 
cal by now. But l never would have 
come in here in the first place 
then, he thought. 

He waited. More than a minute 
passed; then, finally, the blank wall 
before him rolled aside, and the ship 
was open to him at last. He entered. 

At first it seemed to him the in- 
terior was totally dark. Gradually, 
his retinal rods conveyed a little in- 
formation. 

A dim light flickered at one end 
of the narrow tubular ship. He could 
make out a few things: rows of re- 
inforcing struts circling the ship at 
regularly spaced distances; a kind of 
control-panel with quite thorough- 
ly alien-looking instruments on it; a 
large chamber at one end which 
might be used for storage of food. 

But where 9 s the alien? Donald- 
son wondered. 

He turned, slowly, through a 
three hundred sixty degree rotation, 
squinting in the dimness. A sort of 
mist hung before his eyes; the alien’s 
exhalation, perhaps. But he saw no 
sign of the Kethlan. There was a 
sweetish, musky odor in the ship, un- 
pleasant though not unbearable. 

“Everything okay?” Caldwell’s 
voice said in his earphones. 

“So far. But I can’t find the alien. 
It’s damnably dark in here.” 

“Look up,” Caldwell advised. 
“You’ll find him. Took our man a 
while too, yesterday,” 



IF 




Puzzled, Donaldson raised his 
head and stared into the gloom- 
shrouded rafters of the ship, won- 
dering what he was supposed to see. 
In Kethlani he said loudly, “Where 
are you? I see you not.” 

“I am here,” came the harsh 
voice, from above. 

Donaldson looked. Then he 
backed away, double-taking, 
and looked again. 

A great shaggy thing hung head 
down against the roof of the ship. 
Staring intently, Donaldson made out 
a blunt, piggish face with flattened 
nostrils and huge flaring ears; the 
eyes, bright yellow but incredibly 
tiny, glittered with the unmistakable 
light of intelligence. He saw a body 
about the size of a man, covered 
with darkish thick fur and termin- 
ating in two short, thick, powerful- 
looking legs. As he watched the 
Kethlan shivered and stretched forth 
its vast leathery wings. In the dark- 
ness, Donaldson could see the cord- 
ed muscular arm in the wing, and 
the very humanlooking fingers 
which sprouted from the uppermost 
part of the wing. 

Violent disgust rose in him, com- 
pounded from his own general dis- 
like for animals' and from the half- 
remembered Transylvanian folk- 
tales that formed part of every 
child’s heritage. He felt sick; he con- 
trolled himself only by remember- 
ing that he was in essence an am- 
bassador, and any sickness would 
have disastrous consequences for 
him and for Earth. He. dared not of- 
fend the Kethlan. 

My God , he thought. An intelli- 
gent bat! 

THE SHADOW OF WINGS 



H e managed to stammer out the 
words for greeting, and the 
alien responded. Donaldson, looking 
away, saw the elongated shadow of 
wings cast across the ship by the 
faint light at the other end. He felt 
weak, wobbly-legged; he wanted des- 
perately to dash through the now- 
closed airlock. But he forced him- 
self to recover balance. He had a 
job to do. 

“I did not expect you to know 
Kethlani,” the alien said. “It makes 
my job much less difficult.” 

“And your job is — ?” 

“To bring friendship from my 
people to yours. To link our worlds 
in brotherhood.” 

The last concept was a little mud- 
dy to Donaldson; the literal transla- 
tion he made mentally was children - 
of -one-cave , but some questioning 
eventually brought over the concept 
of brotherhood. 

His eyes were growing more ac- 
customed to the lighting, now, and 
he could see the Kethlan fairly well. 
An ugly brute, no doubt of it — 
but probably I look just as bad to 
him, he thought. The creature’s 
wingspread was perhaps seven or 
eight feet. Donaldson tried to pic- 
ture a world of the beasts, skies 
thick with leather-winged commut- 
ers on their way to work. 

Evolution had made numerous 
modifications in the bat structure, 
Donaldson saw. The brain, of 
course; and the extra fingers, aside 
from the ones from which the wings 
had sprouted. The eyes looked weak, 
in typical bat-fashion, but probably 
there was compensation by way of 
keen auditory senses. 

123 




Donaldson said, “Where is your 
world?” 

“Far from here. It — ” 

The rest of the answer was unin- 
telligible to Donaldson. He felt 
lavage impatience with his own 
limited vocabulary; he wished he had 
worked just a little harder on trans- 
lating the Syrtis Major documents. 
Well, it was too late for that now, of 
course. 

Caldwell cut in suddenly from 
outside. “Well? We’re picking up all 
the jabber. What’s all the talk 
about?” 

“Can’t you wait till I’m finished?” 
Donaldson snapped. Then, repent- 
ing, he said: “Sorry. Guess I’m 
jumpy. Seems he’s an ambassador 
from his people, trying to establish 
friendly relations with us. At least, 
I think so. I’ll tell you more when 
I know something about it.” 

S lowly, in fits and starts the story 
emerged. Frequently Donald- 
son had to ask the Kethlan to 
stop and double back while he 
puzzled over a word. He had no way 
of recording any of the new words 
he was learning, but he had always 
had a good memory, and he simply 
tucked them away. 

The Kethlani had visited the So- 
lar System many years ago. Donald- 
son was unable to translate the ac- 
tual figure, but it sounded like a lot. 
At that time, the Martians were at 
the peak of their civilization, and 
Earth was just an untamed wilder- 
ness populated by naked primates. 
The Kethlan wryly admitted that 
they had written off Earth as a po- 
tential place of civilization because 
124 



a study of the bat population of 
Earth had proved unpromising. 
They had never expected the pri- 
mates to evolve this way. 

But now they had returned, 
thousands of years later. Mars was 
bleak and its civilization decayed, 
but the third world had unexpected- 
ly attained a high degree of culture 
and was welcome to embrace the 
Kethlani worlds in friendship and 
amity. 

“How many worlds db you inhab- 
it?” 

The Kethlan counted to fifteen, 
by ones. “There are many others we 
do not inhabit, but simply maintain 
friendly relations with. Yours would 
be one, we hope.” 

The conversation seemed to dwin- 
dle to a halt. Donaldson had run 
out of questions to ask, and he was 
exhausted by the hour-long strain of 
conversing in an alien language, un- 
der these conditions, within a 
cramped ship, talking to a creature 
whose physical appearance filled 
him with loathing and fear. 

His head throbbed. His stomach 
was knotted in pain and sweat 
made his clothes cling clammily to 
his body. He started to grope for 
ways to terminate the interview; then 
an idea struck him. 

He quoted a fragment of a docu- 
ment written in pure Kethlani B. 

There was an instant of stunned 
silence; then the alien asked in 
tones of unmistakable suspicion, 
“Where did you learn that 
language?” 

“I haven’t really learned it. I just 
know a few words.” 

He explained that he had found 

IF 




examples of both Kethlani A and 

Kethlani B along with their Mar- 
tian equivalents; he had worked fair- 
ly comprehensively on the A lan- 
guage, but had only begun to ex- 
plore the B recently. 

The Kethlan seemed to accept 
that. Then it said: “That is not a 
Kethlani language.” 

Surprised, Donaldson uttered the 
interrogative expletive. 

The Kethlan said, “It is the lan- 
guage of our greatest enemies, our 
rivals, our bitter foes. It is the Thyg- 
nor tongue.” 

“But — why did we find your 
language and the other side-by-side, 
then?” 

After a long pause the alien said, 
“Once Thygnor and Kethlan were 
friends. Long ago we conducted a 
joint expedition to this sector of 
space. Long ago, before the rivalry 
sprang up. But now — ” the alien took 
on a sorrowful inflection — “now we 
are enemies.” 

That explained a great many 
things, Donaldson realized. The 
differences between Kethlani A and 
Kethlani B had been too great for it 
to seem as if one race spoke both of 
them. But a joint expedition — that 
made it understandable. 

“Some day, perhaps, the Thygnor 
will visit your world. But by then 
you will be on guard against them.” 

“What do they look like?” 

The alien described them, and 
Donaldson listened and was revolt- 
ed. As far as he could understand, 
they were giant intelligent toads, 
standing erect, amphibian but warm- 
blooded, vile-smelling, their bodies 
exuding a nauseous thick secretion. 
THE SHADOW OF WINGS 



Giant toads, bats, the lizards of 
Mars — evidently the primate mo- 
nopoly of intelligence was confined 
solely to Earth, Donaldson realized. 
It was a humbling thought. His face 
wrinkled in displeasure at the mental 
image of the toad-people the Keth- 
lan had created for him, as he re- 
called the harmless little frog Paul 
had captured by the lake. 

H e spoke in English, attracting 
Caldwell’s attention, and ex- 
plained the situation. 

“He wants me to swear brother- 
hood with him. He also says 
there’s another intelligent race with 
interstellar travel — toads, no less 
— and that they’re likely to pay us 
a visit some day too. What should I 
do?” 

“Go ahead and swear broth- 
erhood,” Caldwell said after a brief 
pause. “It can’t hurt. We can al- 
ways unswear it later, if we like. 
Say we had our fingers crossed while 
we were doing it, or something. 
Then when the frogs get here we 
can find out which bunch is better 
for us to be in league with.” 

The cynicism of the reply an- 
noyed Donaldson, but it was not his 
place to raise any objections. He said 
to the alien, “I am prepared to pledge 
brotherhood between Earth and the 
Kethlan worlds.” 

The Kethlan fluttered suddenly 
down from its perch with a rustle of 
great wings, and stood facing Don- 
aldson, tucking its wings around its 
thick shaggy body. Alarmed, Don- 
aldson stepped back. 

The alien said reassuringly, “The 
way we pledge is by direct physi- 

125 




cal embrace, symbolizing harmony 
and friendship across the cosmos.” 
He unfurled his wings. “Come close 
to me.” 

No! Donaldson shrieked inward- 
ly, as the mighty wings rose high 
and wrapped themselves about him. 
Go away! Don't touch me! He could 
smell the sweet, musky smell of the 
alien, feel its furry warmth, hear the 
mighty heart pounding, pounding in 
that massive ribcage . 

Revulsion dizzied him. He forced 
himself to wrap his arms around the 
barrel of a body while the wings 
blanketed him, and they stood that 
way for a moment, locked in a 
tight embrace. 

At length the alien released him. 
“Now we are friends. It is only the 
beginning of a long and fruitful re- 
lationship between our peoples. I 
hope to speak with you again be- 
fore long.” 

It was a dismissal. On watery legs 
Donaldson tottered forward toward 
the opening airlock, pausing only to 
mutter a word of farewell before he 
stumbled through and out into the 
arms of the waiting men outside. 

“W e 1 1?” Caldwell demanded. 



“What happened? Did you swear 
brotherhood?” 

“Yes,” Donaldson said wearily. “I 
swore.” The stench of the alien ciung 
to him, sweet in his nostrils. It was 
as though throbbing wings still en- 
folded him. “I’m leaving now,” he 
said. “I still have a little of my vaca- 
tion left. I want to take it.” 

He gulped a drink that someone 
handed him. He was shaking and 
gray-faced, but the effect of the 
embrace was wearing off. Only an 
irrational phobia , he told himself. 
/ shouldn't be reacting this way. 

But already he was beginning to 
forget the embrace of the Kethlani, 
and the rationalization did him no 
good. A new and more dreadful 
thought was beginning to develop 
within him. 

He was the only Terrestrial ex- 
pert on Kethlani B, too — the Thyg- 
nor tongue. And some day, per- 
haps soon, the Thygnor were going 
to come to Earth, and Caldwell was 
going to impress him into service as 
an interpreter again. 

He wondered how the toad-peo- 
ple pledged eternal brotherhood.

The Place Where Readers 



And Editor Meet... 



Dear Editor: 

If may not be a slick magazine, 
but it is the most fun to read of any 
science-fiction magazine on the mar- 
ket today. It is nice to know that 
there is a magazine where not only 
new authors can try their talents, 
but where the greats like Heinlein 
can use a freer style than the re- 
strictions of the other magazines, 
with their strictly set editorial poli- 
cies, will allow. 

The ending of the Heinlein novel 
was a novelette in itself, with too 
little continuity with the first two 
installments. Presumably this will be 
toned down and abridged and then 
hardbacked as r. juvenile, which is a 
pity, since the way it is now it packs 
an impact in spite of its disjointed 
style. As in most Heinlein novels the 
description was more entertaining 
than the action, and there were a 
number of loose ends in the plot. 
I certainly don't want a detailed ex- 
planation breaking in, mystery story 
style, but there is no reason I can 



see for "Uncle Tom” being set free 
without a more certain hold on him 
than they had, for example. The big 
trouble is that Heinlein let his repu- 
tation get in the way, and avoided 
the melodramatic action sequences 
which would have been less believ- 
able but more appropriate, and more 
fun. 

The letter column was much too 
short. Now that you have room for 
"another full length novelette”, you 
should have room for a five-page 
letter column at least. Admittedly 
you seem to have an unbelievable 
wealth of story material to use, with 
Heinlein and McIntosh .n this issue, 
and Clement and Budrys in the next, 
but it won't hurt to spread all this 
talent over a very slightly longer 
space, and give the reader a chance 
to comment on it.

HUE AND CRY 



Dear Editor: 

For the first time in perhaps half 
a year, I believe I will write you 
one of my interminable letters of 
comment on your sterling publica- 
tions, each of which pretends to 
come from a different publishing 
house. Perhaps your Mr. Guinn is a 
megalomaniac? 

As usual, Galaxy is good for its 
long fiction and disappointing in its 
short. Out of -even short stories in 
the last three issues, only one (On 
the Fourth Planet) was good. This is 
the sort of sf that is really reward- 
ing. 

Worlds of Tomorrow looks quite 
promising, assuming that the first 
issue is indicative of the editorial 
policy. These stories are all good, 
to one degree or another, and I 
can't quite put my finger on what- 
ever it is about the total effect that 
makes it so different from Galaxy 
or If. I think it's because these sto- 
ries are almost entirely straightfor- 
ward. 

If: Who was it who referred to 
it as Worlds of Galaxy Rejects? That 
is not very fair, but If certainly 
does read as a poor man's Galaxy. 
When Whirly birds Call should not 
have been published; This Way to 
the Egress was unintelligible, for 
me. The Shipshape Miracle had a 
very Sheckleyish plot — but Shock- 
ley should have handled it, since he 
knows how to do it right. With Sim- 
ak (who is used to an entirely dif- 
ferent type of story) at the helm, it 
reads rather clumsily. 

Capjbain of the Kali : Wow! You're 
right, there is a find! Gary Wright 
has done a fine job with an interest- 
ing story, and I hope you will en- 
courage him to keep writing. 7 par- 
ticularly appreciate a story which 
is well enough expressed that one 
can pick out one sentence that will 



give the theme of the story; here, 
you have: “There was no alien here 
but himself.” 

To keep on a happy note, The 
Time Tombs was another good story. 
Ballard is a writer who does give a 
good clear picture of the society he 
ha* placed his plot in, and the plot 
was worthwhile one. 

Saline Solution: I for one enjoy 
Retief. I'm fully happy with him as 
long as the readers don't go around 
screaming about what a wonderful 
writer he is. Or else, ho,w terrible 
the series is. Let's get one thing 
straight: Retief is sheer space opera 
. but what on Earth is wrong 
with well-handled space opera? 

The Tem-Point Princess is yet an- 
other good story. Considering the 
usual half-and-half quality of If, 
this seems to be a bumper crop. Mc- 
Intosh just touched on the important 
and debatable point, "... Only we 
don't call it prostitution. What do 
you dislike about the way the Leon- 
tans do it. General?” But he did 
drive in his main point pretty well. 
Rmmmn, I wonder if he purposely 
wrote The Ten-Point Princess as an 
answer to Vercors' Le Silence De La 
Mer. 

And now, Podkayne of Mars. Boy, 
is that Heinlein getting lazy. In the 
first installment nothing happens. 
It could have taken up one chapter, 
or possibly two, in a well-balanced 
novel. The second installment could 
have been cut down a good deal, 
and the third was reasonably full 
the way it stood. Or, in other words, 
this novel was quite incomplete, as 
such. Ah, well you may ask, what 
else might Heinlein have said? 
Where could the plot have gone? 
Not very far, certainly, but certainly 
it is not an unworkable plot. No, 
the problem is simply this: Pod- 
kayne should have been what you 



128 



IF 




call a Novella. But Heinlein was too 
lazy to condense, when he had almost 
guaranteed sales, anyway. And there 
was obviously another reason: a 

novella could not be sold to Scrib- 
ner's or somesuch as a juvenile, 
which is what will clearly happen 
to this: one. To be brief, it appears 
to have been a mistake for Heinlein 
to use this plot, unless he could make 
more of a story of it And if he 
could, why didn't he? 

And that's it. I no longer have 
the strength to comment on anything 
but the fiction. And it is a good thing 
that this letter is not even vaguely 
aimed at “Hue and Cry". By my 
count, it holds more words than the 
last three installments of “Hue and 
Cry" put together!

Dear Editor: 

There are a few things about sci- 
ence fiction that might arouse some 
worthwhile response from your for- 
midable readers. 

First: Science-fiction distribution 
is a problem. Not all towns get all 
science-fiction titles, even when the 
titles which do appear sell out in a 
day or two. Better distribution 
means better sales and better sales 
could mean a better magazine. 

Second : According to hearsay, sci- 
ence-fiction pocketbooks outsell sci- 
ence-fiction magazines about 3 to 
1. Pocketbooks depend largely on sf 
magazines for their material. The 
reader has little friendly newsy dis- 
course with the pocketbook. The 
reader can't know when the pocket- 
book should be on the stands or what 
is coming out. So if the pocketbook 
doesn't strike the wholesaler as prof- 
itable he can warehouse it and swear 
it didn't sell. In places I have seen 



several people read science fiction, 
but most of them read only pocket- 
books. Why? “Magazines have cheap 
comic-book type covers and the sto- 
ries are probably on the same level.” 
Or more often: “Magazine stories 
are too short. I like long novels." Is 
this true everywhere? 

Third: Sf magazines seem better 
than ever and may be selling better 
ktely. Yet they ought alsQ to reach 
the pocketbook audience so they can 
read the “better" stories “earlier” 
when they first appear. How can 
this be done? Large format suggests 
quality to many people. Arty pocket- 
book covers sell to still more people. 
Long novels sell to still more people. 
Slicker paper will sell a few copies. 
Color inside will sell more copies; 
color sells, in this culture of ours. 

Fourth: Does science fiction need 
another “almost hopeless cause" like 
space flight used to be? Now, how 
about promoting interstellar travel, 
something besides rocket drives, re- 
ligion and space, what is human 
and what is food, the general ethics 
of man in the universe ; the sea, ge- 
netic improvement of the human 
race, overpopulation DNA, human 
creativeness vs. the regurgative 
memory, or the human mind. These 
are all science-fiction themes, but 
the general public only recognizes 
cigar-shaped spaceships as the con- 
tent of science fiction. Or does sci- 
ence fiction need only color, wonder 
and conviction? Or does it need to 
catch the eye and flatter the intel- 
lect of more readers? Or are we a 
closed corporation actually afraid of 
new people and new ideas? Is sci- 
ence fiction our own private, secure, 
finished outpost from which we will 
not venture? Are we really more ven- 
turesome than Mrs. Fuddelfade next 
door who is still afraid of science 
fiction? The art work in our maga- 



HUE AND CRY 



129 




sines, which is still mostly rehash 
of 1934 hack pulp art, suggests we 
might need a little intellectual cour- 
age. We might face a tiger, but new 
iaeas make us tremble. Or is the 
great body of science-fiction world 
still raring to go to Hell and back 
for the sheer hell of proving it's 
there? 

Five : could a well established mag- 
azine like Galaxy go 8% by 11 inches, 
250 pages, contain a complete BOOK 
LENGTH NOVEL IN EACH IS- 
SUE plus a substantial body of 
shorter material, and maybe two- 
color art, better paper, and a small 
science section to pick up ads, and 
sell for 75 cents or a dollar per 
copy per month? Don't yell yet, 
readers. Because threj poor or medi- 
ocre sf magazines cost you $1.05 a 
month anyway. Why not get it all 
in one good pcckage? Such a pack- 
age could attract the best writers 
and artists and put science fiction 
or a very substantial footing. It 
would take nerve and money to 
start it. EDITOR, is such a thing 
possible? 

Six : Pm not *n upstart new- 

comer or a senile oldster. I've pur- 
chased about every science-fiction 
magazine published since 1938, the 
exceptions being Planet , Captain Fu- 
ture and a certain Shaver matter. 1 
care a lot about science fiction and 
how beautifully it is printed and 
how well it sells How about you?

* Is it possible? Probably not— or 
not at 75c or .«* dollar, anyway. Or 
ret without a far heavier volume of 
advertising than any sf magazine 
has ever had . or ; s ever likely to 
get Rut it’s an attractive 

thought! Editor 



Dear Editor: 

Congratulations on raising your 
price ; hope it stays that way because 
I've thought out the griir alterna- 
tives: you fold, or you go back to 
your rut. Seems to me as if you'll 
be trying for a Hugo i: 1964, if you 
can keep up this quality for five 
more issues. 

One thing about a long letter: 
You can chop out one paragraph 
and run it as a letter.

and a half I 

But even with such Herculean 
measures, we're out of space again. 
To those who didn't get their mis- 
sives in — sorry, and please don't stop 
sending them! 

This issue's “first” is a young 
fellow named Bruce McAllister who 
hails from California — and Italy, 
Washington, D.C., the Riviera and 
wherever else the orders of his Navy 
captain father took him; we liked 
The Faces Outside , and hope you 
will too. Not quite a “first”, but 
still an unfamiliar name in science- 
fiction magazines, is Alexei Pan- 
shin. Down to the Worlds of Men 
is actually the second story he sold, 
but we don't count the first, because 
it appeared in one of those slick- 
paper things that have nothing to 
offer their contributors but pres- 
tige, pleasure, pride and money. 

By the way, did you notice who 
leads off our next issue? He's prac- 
tically a discovery, at that; he 
hasn't written a new story for a sci- 
ence-fiction magazine in nearly fif- 
teen years, until he finally gave in 
and wrote this one for us. Name's 
Van Vogt. We think he’ll catch on.
