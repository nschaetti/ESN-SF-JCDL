DO YOU struggle for balance? Are you forever trying to 
maintain energy, enthusiasm and the will to do? Do your personality 
and power of accomplishment ebb and flow — like a stream controlled by some unseen valve? Deep within you are minute organisms. From their function spring your emotions. They govern your 
creative ideas and moods — yes, even your enjoyment of life. Once they 
were thought to be the mysterious seat of the soul — and to be left 
unexplored. Now cast aside superstition and learn to direct intelligently these powers of self. 
Let the Rosicrucians, an age-old fraternity of thinking men and women (not 
a religion), point out how you may fashion life as you want it — by making the 
fullest use of these little-understood natural faculties which you possess. This is 
a challenge to make the most of your 
heritage as a human. Write for the Free

Traps € Prut I s 
Come two centuries ago, a cou^ pie of mathematicians were 
corresponding about their favorite subject, the intrinsic properties of numbers. Said GoldbacH 
to Euler: I conjecture, though I 
have not been able to prove, that 
every even number can be written as the sum of two primes. 
Said Euler to Goldbach: Well, 
you may be right. Anyway, every 
even number I’ve tried it on is 
just the way you said it would be. 
But where’s the proof? 
Two hundred years later the 
proof is still missing — though 
a Norwegian named Brun, around 
the time of the first World War, 
did manage to prove that every 
even number could be written as 
the sum of nine primes, and a 
Russian named Vinogradof, in 
1937, proved that every sufficiently large odd number could 
be written as the sum of three 
primes. (The stickler is that Vinogradof could not say just what 
the term “sufficiently large” 
meant.) The question still is not 
closed. And there’s hardly a 
mathematician alive, or for that 
matter dead in the last couple 
centuries, who hasn’t spent at 
least an afternoon, sometimes 
years, trying to prove whether 
Goldbach’s famous conjecture is 
right or wrong. Proving it was 
wrong would be easy — all you’d 
need to do would be to find one 
exception. Proving it right is a 
lot harder, in principle; but as 
a matter of fact no one has. 
You might want to put in a 
little time of your own on it. It’s 
easy to see that the first even 
number 2, can be written as the 
sum of 1 and 1, both primes; 4 
can be written as 2 plus 2; 6 as 5 
plus 1, 8 as 7 plus 1, 10 as 7 plus 
3 . etc. You needn’t bother 
with those small numbers; every 
even number up to 10,000 has already been studied, and all of 
them, true enough, can be written 
as the sum of two primes. But 
what about 10,002? Or 14,137,066. 
nphere is something vaguely 
troubling about that sort of 
problem, and that is that there’s 
a sort of unsettling appearance of 
an injection of language hangups into a non-language problem. 
Take that word “even.” Many 
writers have spent many words 
discussing the unique position of 
the number 2 as “the only even 
prime.” Is there really anything 
unique about it? “Even,” after 
all, means only “divisible by 
two.” Wouldn’t it be just as sensible to say that 3 is unique in 
that it is the only prime divisible 
by three?

We Have a pet conjecture of 
our own, which we’ve been wasting 
a lot of scratch-paper trying to 
test out. It’s a generalization of 
Goldbach’s notion, and at least 
at first glance it seems to us to 
be as difficult to prove or disprove as Goldbach’s own. Goldbach says that any number which 1 
has the prime 2 as a factor (that 
is, any even number) can be written as the sum of 2 primes. The 
generalization says that any number which has any given prime p 
as a factor (p being 3, 5, 7, 11, 
13, 17 — whatever you will) can 
be written as the sum of that 
many primes. The number 6, for 
instance, has the prime 33, as a 
factor, and can be written as 3 
plus 2 plus 1. The number 46 has 
the prime 23 as a factor, and can 
be written as 1 plus 2 plus 2 plus 
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 
2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 plus 3. (As 
well as in several other ways.) 
It would be interesting to know 
whether this particular conjecture is true or false, and anybody 
with a lot of spare time, or anybody with a computer with spare 
time, is cordially invited to try 
to find a number which doesn’t 
have these characteristics and to 
let us know about it. For one 
thing, it might be easier to prove 
the generalization of Goldbach’s 
theorem than its special case; 
8 
and think of all the millions of 
mathematical man-hours we 
could save just by doing that. 
For another, it might cast a 
little heeded light on just how 
many of our famous “insoluble” 
problems are resisting solution 
more because of language difficulties than because of their own 
merits. 
Mathematical problems? Yes, 
but we weren’t thinking of just 
mathematical problems. As Korzybski and Hayakawa have been 
telling us for some decades, and 
as McLuhan may (or may not) 
be telling us now, the language 
in which we attempt to state our 
problems is quite capable of baffling our attempts to solve them. 
We do have a sort of egocentric tendency to assume that the 
fact that we have devised a word 
must necessarily indicate that 
there is something that the word 
means. When the words that get 
in our way are “odd” and “even,” 
perhaps it is merely an annoyance 
that they shape our thinking in 
ways that defeat our purposes. 
But when the words are “freedom” and “democracy” and “national honor” perhaps the consequences are graver than that.

the floating island of the Laputans, one of the far-out philosophers he met refused to speak

JORSLEM 
by ROBERT SILVERBERG 
Illustrated by GAUGHAN 
In the holy city of Jorslem 
lay the one hope of Renewal. 
But there was no end of duty 
for a Watcher who had failed. 
I 
y^vur world was truly tKeirs, now. 
^ All the way across Eyropj 
I could see that, as I made my 
Pilgrimage toward holy Jorslem. 
Thie invaders had taken every
thing, and we belonged to them 
as beasts in a barnyard belong 
to the farmer. 
They were everywhere. Some 
were sightseers, others were administrators; all had the look of 
masters. They walked with cool 
confidence, as if telling us tiiat 
the will had drawn favor from 
us and conferred it upon them. 
They were not cruel to us, and 
yet they drained us of vitality by 
their mere presence among us. 
Our guilds became nothing. Our 
elaborate society was again without structure, as it had been in 
the chaos at the end of the Second 
Cycle. Our sun, our moons, our 
museums of ancient relics, our 
ruins of former cycles, our cities, 
our palaces, our future, our present and our past had all undergone a transfer of title. 
At night the blaze of the stars 
mocked us. All the universe looked down on our shame. 
The cold wind of winter told 
us that for our sins our freedom 
had been lost. The bright heat of 
summer told us that for our pride 
we had been humbled. 
Through a changed world we 
moved, stripped of our past 
selves. I who was once of the 
Watchers who roved the stars 
four times each day now had lost 
that pleasure, for there was no 
more Watching to do. I had passed from that guild to join the 
Rememberers, but only for a 
while; and now, bound for Jorslem, I found cool comfort in the 
Hope that as a Pilgrim I might 
gain redemption and renewal in 
that holy city. My traveling companion — the former Rememberer Olmayne — and I repeated 
12 
each night the rituals of our Pilgrimage: 
“We yield to the Will.” 
“We yield to the Will.” 
“In all things great and small.” 
“In all things great and small.” 
“And ask forgiveness.” 
“And ask forgiveness.” 
“For sins actual and potential.” 
“For sins actual and potential.” 
“And pray for understanding 
and repose.” 
“And pray for understanding 
and repose.” 
“Through all our days until redemption comes.” 
“Through all our days until redemption comes.” 
Thus we spoke the words. Saying them, we clutched the cool 
polished spheres of starstone, icy 
as frostflowers, that all Pilgrims 
carry, and made communion with 
the Will. And so we journeyed 
Jorslemward in this world that 
no longer was owned by man. 
II 
T t was at the Talyan approach to 
Land Bridge that Olmayne 
first used her cruelty on me. 
Olmayne was cruel by first nature; and yet we had been Pilgrims together for many months, 
traveling from Perris eastward 
over the mountains and down the 
length of Talya to the bridge, 
and she had kept her claws 
sheathed. Until this place. 
The occasion was our halting 
for a company of invaders coming north from Afreek. There were 
perhaps twenty of them, tall and 
harsh-faced. They rode in a 
gleaming covered vehicle, long 
and narrow, with thick sandcolored treads and small windows. We could see the vehicle 
from far away, raising a cloud 
of dust as it neared us. 
This was a hot time of year. 
The sky itself was the color of 
sand, and it was streaked with 
folded sheets of heat-radiation, 
glowing and terrible energy 
streams of turquoise and gold. 
Perhap fifty of us stood 1 beside 
the road, with the land of Talya 
at our backs and the continent of 
Afreek before us. We were a varied group: some Pilgrims, like 
Olmayne and myself, making the 
trek toward the holy city of 
Jorslem, but also I counted in 
the band five former Watchers — 
shorn of their profession, as I Had 
been, by the conquest of Earth — 
and also several indexers, a Sentinel, a pair of Communicants, a 
Scribe and even a few Changelings. We gathered in a straggling 
assembly, awarding the road by 
default to the invaders. 
Land Bridge is not wide, and 
the road will not allow many to 
use it at any time. Yet in normal 
times the flow of traffic had always gone in both directions at 
once. Here today, we feared to
gallant ine. 
1 We have long brooded about a 
, real fantasy publishing program, 
nudged along by, among other 
I things, Jim Blish's enthusiasm for 
I Cabell. Now, since our privately 
expanding universe permits two 
' s.f.-cum-fantasy titles each month, 
| plus an honest-to-God, no-holdsbarred adult fantasy, we can in" dulge a long-cherished dream. (In 
| order to avoid a tedious argument 
about definition of terms, let's not 
* have one. An argument’ that is. A 
| modest sample of the creative 
, thinking we do here at Ballantine 
’ — it allows more time for reading.) 
And such delicious reading: Wil| liam Morris, Lord Dunsany, George 
l MacDonald, (you'll love George — 
i if you have not already encoun\ tered him — a sort of Bunyanesque 
" Kafka), Hannes Bok, Clark Ashton 
^ Smith and many more. And of 
course Cabell. We'll be doing 
I them all in the months to come, 
i starting with Fletcher Pratt's THE 
? BLUE STAR. 
f The series is being edited by Lin 
i Carter, who will be doing Introducf tions for each volume. His own 
| book, TOLKIEN: A Look Behind 
r "The Lord of the Rings," comes out 
I in March, at 95c, and is aptly de[ scribed on the cover as "A Joyous 
Exploration of Tolkien's Sources." And indeed, it is obvious 
that nothing delights Lin more than 
puttering about among heroic sagas, epics, Sumerian tablets, Norse 
runes, and the like. Fortunately for 
all, he makes his delight infectious. 
With elves dogging every footstep, and 
faery coming out our ears, it is rather 
difficult to get back to the stern reality 
of science fiction. So let's not, for a bit. 
Among others titles which this nongeneration-gap publisher is doing are Alan 
Watts' PSYCHOTHERAPY EAST AMD WEST 
and Laing's POLITICS OF EXPERIENCE. 
Later we'll be doing an original on the 
meaning of MARCUSE — the German guru, 
(flowerkraut?) . O God. Back to immediacies. 
We would really like you to know 
about a perfectly delightful collecttion of shorts from Miriam Allen 
deFord, titled XENOGENESIS, on 
the general theme of reproduction 
among extraterrestrials, and James 
White's stories, THE ALIENS AMONG US. Jim is the English writer 
(Scot, really) who writes as well 
about aliens as our own Hal Clement. Both books are March, both 
75c each. All these titles, and many 
others, can be most rapidly obtained by ordering direct from our 
stockroom — send money and a list 
of what you want to Ballantine, 
Dept. GCS, 36 West 20th Street, 
New York, N.Y. Or better, send 
for a catalog so that you can make 
up a really long list. Spend money. 
Remember, the population bomb 
keeps ticking — or, as Paul Ehrlich 
says, as long as you've booked 
passage on the Titantic, you might 
as well go first class. BB 
14 
go forward while invaders were 
this close, and so we remained 
clustered timidly, watching our 
conquerors approach. 
One of the Changelings moved 
toward me. He was small of stature for that breed, but wide 
through the shoulders; his skin 
seemed much too tight for his 
frame; his eyes were large and 
green-rimmed, his hair grew in 
thick, widely-spaced pedestallike clumps, and his nose was 
barely perceptible, so that his 
nostrils appeared to sprout from 
his upper lip. Despite this, he was 
less grotesque than most Changelings appear. His expression was 
solemn, but with a hint of bizarre 
playfulness lurking somewhere. 
He said in a voice that was little more than a feathery whisper, ‘‘Do you think we’ll be delayed long, Pilgrim?” 
In former times one did not 
address a Pilgrim unsolicitedly 
— especially if one happened to 
be a Changeling. Such customs 
meant nothing to me, but Olmayne drew back with a hiss of 
distaste. 
I said, “We will wait here until 
our masters allow us to pass. Is 
there any choice?” 
“None friend, none.” 
At that friend, Olmayne hissed 
again and glowered at the little 
Changeling. He turned to her, 
and his anger showed, for suddenly six parallel bands of scarlet 
pigment blazed beneath the glossy skin of his cheeks. But his 
only overt response to her was 
a courteous bow. He said 1 , “I introduce myself. I am Bemalt, 
naturally guildless, a native of 
Nayrub in Deeper Afreek. I do 
not inquire after your names, 
Pilgrims. Are you bound for Jorslem?” 
“Yes,” I said, as Olmayne 
swung about to present her back. 
“And you? Home to Nayrub after travels?” 
“No,” said Bemalt. “I go to 
Jorslem also.” 
T nstantly I felt cold and hostile, 
-*■ my initial response to the 
Changeling’s suave charm fading 
at once. I had had a Changeling, 
false though he turned out to be, 
as a traveling companion before; 
he also had been charming, but I 
wanted no more like him. Edgily, 
distantly, I said, “May I ask 
what business a Changeling might 
have in Jorslem?” 
He detected the chill in my 
tone, and his huge eyes registered 
sorrow. “We too are permitted 
to visit the holy city, I remind 
you. Even our land. Do you fear 
that Changelings will once again 
seize the shrine of renewal, as 
we did a thousand years ago before we were cast down into 
guildlessness?” He laughed harshly. “I threaten no one, Pilgrim. 
I am hideous of face, but not dangerous. May the Will grant you
what you seek. Pilgrim.” He 
made a gesture of respect and 
went back to the other Changelings. 
Olmayne spun around on me, 
furious. 
“Why do you talk to such; 
beastly creatures?” 
“The man approached me. He 
was merely being friendly. We 
are all cast together here, Olmayne, and — ” 
“Man. Man! You call a 
Changeling a man?” 
“They are human, Olmayne.” 
“Just barely. Tomis, I loathe 
such monsters. My flesh creeps 
to have them near me. If I could, 
I’d banish them from this world!” 
“Where is the serene tolerance 
a Rememberer must cultivate?” 
She flamed at the mockery in 
my voice. “We are not required 
to love Changelings, Tomis. They 
are one of the curses laid upon 
our planet — parodies of humanity, enemies of truth and beauty. 
I despise them!” 
It was not a unique attitude. 
But I had no time to reproach 
Olmayne for her intolerance; the 
vehicle of the invaders was drawing near. I hoped we might resume our journey once it went by. 
It slowed and halted, however, 
and several of the invaders came 
out. They walked unhurriedly toward us, their long arms dangling 
like slack ropes. 
“Who is the leader here?” asked one of them. 
No one replied. 
The invader said impatiently, 
after a moment, “No leader? No 
leader? Very well, all of you, 
listen. The road must be cleared. 
A convoy is coming through. Go 
back to Palerm and wait until 
tomorrow.” 
“But I must be in Agupt by — ” 
the Scribe began. 
“Land Bridge is closed today,” 
said the invader. “Go back to 
Palerm.” His voice was calm. 
The Scribe shivered, his jowls 
swinging, and said no more. 
Several of the others by the 
side of the road looked as if they 
wished to protest. The Sentinel 
turned away and spat. A man 
who boldly wore the mask of the 
shattered guild of Defenders in 
his cheek clenched his fists and 
plainly fought back a surge of 
fury. The Changelings whispered 
to one another. Bernalt smiled 
bitterly at me, and shrugged. 
Go back to^ Palerm? Waste a 
day’s march in this heat? For 
what ? 
nphe invader gestured casually, 
telling us to disperse. 
Now it was that Olmayne was 
unkind to me. In a low voice she 
said, “Explain to them, Tomis, 
that you are in the pay of the 
Procurator of Perris, and they 
will let the two of us pass.” 
My shoulders sagged as if she 
had loaded ten years on me. 
“Why did you say such a thing?” 
I asked. 
“It’s hot. I’m tired. It’s idiotic 
of them to send us back to Palerm.” 
“I agree. But I can do nothing. Why try to hurt me?” 
“Does the truth* hurt that 
much?” 
“I am no collaborator, Olmayne.” 
She laughed. “You say that so 
well! But you are, Tomis, you 
are! You sold them documents — “ 
“To save the Prince, your lover,” I reminded her. 
“You dealt with the invaders, 
though.” 
“Stop it, Olmayne.” 
“Now you give me orders?” 
“Olmayne — ” 
Go up to them, Tomis. Tell 
them who you are, make them let 
us go ahead.” 
“The convoys would run us 
down on the road. In any case, 
I have no influence with invaders. 
I am not the Procurator’s man.” 
“I’ll die before I go back to 
Palerm!” 
“Traitor! Treacherous old fool! 
Coward!” 
I .pretended to ignore her, but 
I felt the fire of her words. There 
was no falsehood in them, only 
malice. I had dealt with the conquerors I had betrayed the guild 
that sheltered me, yet it was un
GALAXY 
fair for her to reproach me with 
it. I had been trying only to save 
a man to whom I felt bound, a 
man moreover with whom she 
was in love. It was loathsome of 
Olmayne to tax me with treason 
now, to torment my conscience, 
merely because of a petty rage 
at the heat and dust of the road. 
But this woman had coldly 
slain her own husband. Why 
should she not be malicious in 
trifles as well? 
The invaders had their way; 
we abandoned the road and straggled back to Palerm, a dismal 
sizzling, sleepy town. That evening five Fliers, passing in formation overhead, took a fancy to the 
town and in the moonless night 
they came again and again 
through the sky, three men and 
two women, ghostly and slender 
and beautiful. I stood watching 
them for more than an hour. 
Their great shimmering wings 
scarcely hid the starlight; their 
pale angular bodies moved in 
graceful arcs, arms held pressed 
close to sides, legs together, backs 
gently curved. I had loved a Flier girl once, in a fashion, and the 
sight of those five stirred my 
memories and left me tingling 
with troublesome emotions. 
'Tphe Fliers made their last pass 
and were gone. The false 
moons entered the sky soon afterward. I went into our hostelry
then, and shortly Olmayne asked 
admittance to my room. 
She looked contrite. She carried a squat octagonal flask of 
green wine, not a T alyan brew but 
something from an outworld, no 
doubt purchased at great price. 
Will you forgive me, Tomis?” 
she asked. “Here. I know you like 
these wines.” 
“I would rather not have had 
those words before, and not have 
the wine now,” I told her. 
“My temper grows short in the 
heat. I’m sorry, Tomis. I said a 
stupid and tactless thing.” 
I forgave her, in hope of a 
smoother journey thereafter, and 
we drank most of the wine, and 
then she went to her mom nearby 
to sleep. 
For a long while I lay awake 
beneath a lash of guilt. In her impatience and wrath Olmayne had 
stung me at my vulnerable place; 
I was a betrayer of mankind. I 
wrestled with the issue almost to 
dawn. 
— What had I done? 
I had revealed to our conquerors where a certain document 
might be found. 
— To whom did the document 
belong? 
To the guild of Rememberers. 
— Did’ the invaders have a 
moral right to the document? 
It told of the shameful treatment they had had at the hands 
of o' ancestors. It gave justifica
17 
tion for the conquest oi Earth. 
— What, then, was wrong about 
giving it to them? 
One does not aid one’s conquerors, even when they are morally superior to one. 
— Is a small treason a serious 
thing? 
There are no small treasons. 
In this unprofitable way I 
consumed the night. When the 
day brightened I rose and looked 
skyward and begged the Will to 
help me find redemption in the 
waters of the house of renewal 
in Jorslem. Then I went to awaken Olmayne. 
Ill 
T and Bridge was open on this 
-®— ' 1 day, and we joined the 
throng that was crossing over 
out of Talya into Afreek. 
There are two main routes for 
Pilgrims from Eyrop to Jorslem. 
The northern route involves going through the Dark Lands east 
of Talya, taking the ferry at 
Stanbool, and skirting the western 
coast of the continent of Ais until Jorslem. But Olmayne Had 
been to Stanbool to do research in 
the days when she was a Rememberer, and disliked the place; and 
so we took the southern route, 
across Land Bridge into Afreek, 
and along the shore of the great 
Lake Medit, through Agupt and 
up to Jorslem. 
A true Pilgrim travels only by 
foot. It was not an idea that had 
much appeal to Olmayne, and 
though we walked a great deal, 
we rode whenever we could. She 
was shameless in commandeering 
transportation. Only two-days’ 
walk out of Perris she had got us 
a ride from a rich Merchant 
bound for the coast; the man had 
no intention of sharing His sumptuous vehicle with anyone, but 
he could not resist the sensuality 
of Olmayne’s deep, musical voice, 
even though it issued from the 
sexless grillwork of a pilgrim’s 
mask. 
The Merchant traveled in 
style. His self -primed landcar was 
four times the length of a man, 
wide enough to house five people 
in comfort. There was no direct 
vision, only a series of screens 
revealing upon command what 
lay outside. The temperature never varied. Spigots supplied liqueurs and stronger things; food 
tablets were available; pressure 
couches insulated travelers against 
the irregularities of the road. 
There was slavelight for illumination, keyed to the Merchant’s 
whims. J 
He was a man of pomp and 
bulk, deep olive of skin, with 
well-oiled black hair and somber, 
scrutinizing eyes. He dealt, we 
learned, in foodstuffs of other 
worlds, bartering our poor manufactures for the delicacies of the 
starborn ones. Now he was en 
route to Marsay to examine a 
cargo of hallucinatory insects 
newly come in from one of the 
Belt planets. 
“You like the car?” he asked. 
Olmayne, no stranger to ease 
Herself, was peering at the dense 
inner mantle of diamonded brocade in obvious amazement. “It 
was owned by the Comt of Perris,” He went on. “Yes, I mean it, 
the Comt himself. They turned 
his palace into a museum, you 
know.” 
“I know,” Olmayne said softly. 
nphis was his chariot. It was 
supposed to be part of the 
museum, but I bought it off a 
crooked invader. You didn’t 
know that they Had crooked 
ones too, eS?” The Merchant’s 
robust laughter caused the sensitive mantle on the walls of the 
car to recoil in disdain. “This 
one was the Procurator’s boy 
friend. Yes, they’ve got those, 
too. He was looking for a certain fancy root that grows on a 
planet of the Fishes, something 
to give his virility a little boost, 
you know, and he learned that I 
controlled the whole supply here, 
and so we were able to work out 
a deal. Of course, I had to have 
the car adapted, a little. The 
Comt kept four neuters up front 
and powered the engine right off 
their metabolisms, you understand, running the thing on thermal differentials. Well, that’s a
fine way to power a car, if you 
are a Comt, but it uses up a lot 
of neuters through the year, and 
I felt I’d be overreaching my 
status if I tried anything like 
that. So I had the drive compartment stripped down and replaced with a standard rollerwagon engine, heavy-duty, a really subtle job, and there you are. 
You’re lucky to be in here. It’s 
only that you’re Pilgrims. Ordinarily I don’t let folks come inside, on account that they feel 
envy, and envious folks are dangerous to a man who’s made 
something out of his life. Yet the 
Will brought you two to me. 
Heading for Jorslem, eh?” 
“Yes,” Olmayne said. 
“Me too, but not yet! Not just 
yet, thank you!” He patted his 
middle. “I’d be there, you can 
bet on it, when I feel ready for 
renewal, but that’s a good way 
off, the Will willing! You two 
been Pilgriming long?” 
“No,” Olmayne said. 
“A lot of folks went Pilgrim 
after the conquest, I guess. Well, 
I won’t blame ’em. We each 
adapt in our own ways to changing times. Say, you carrying those 
little stones the Pilgrims carry?” 
“Yes,” Olmayne said. 
“Mind if I see one? Always 
been fascinated by the things. 
There was this trader from one of 
the Darkstar worlds, little skinny 
bastard with skin like oozing tar, 
he offered me ten quintals of the 
things. Said they were genuine, 
gave you the real communion, 
just like the Pilgrims had. I told 
him no, I wasn’t going to fool with! 
the Will. Some things you don’t 
do, even for profit. But afterward 
I wished I’d kept one as a souvenir. I never even touched one.” 
He stretched a hand toward Olmayne. “Can I see?” 
“We may not let others handle 
the starstone,” I said. 
“I wouldn’t tell anybody you 
let me!” 
“It is forbidden.” 
“Look, it’s private in here, the 
most private place on Earth, 
and — ” 
“Please. What you ask is impossible.” 
His face darkened, and I 
thought for a moment he would 
halt the car and order us out. 
My hand slipped into my pouch 
to finger the frigid starstone 
sphere that I had been given at 
the outset of my Pilgrimage. The 
touch of my fingertips brought 
faint resonances of the communion-trance to me, and I shivered 
in pleasure. He must not have it, 
I swore. But the Merchant, having tested us and found resistance, 
did not choose to press the matter. 
We sped onward toward Marsay. 
H e was not a likeable man, but 
he had a certain gross charm. 
Olmayne, who after all was a 
fastidious woman and had lived 
most of her years in the glossy 
seclusion of the Hall of Rememberers, found him harder to take 
than I. But even Olmayne seemed to find him amusing when he 
boasted of his wealth and influence, when he told of the women 
who waited for him on many 
worlds, when he catalogued his 
homes and his trophies and the 
guildmasters who sought his 
counsel, when he bragged of his 
friendships with former Masters 
and Dominators. He talked almost wholly of himself and rarely of us, for which we were 
thankful. 
Our Merchant’s life seemed enviably undisrupted by the fall of 
our planet; he was as rich as 
ever, as comfortable, as free to 
move about. But even he felt 
occasionally irked by the presence of the invaders, as we found 
out by night not far from Marsay, when we were stopped at a 
checkpoint on the road. 
Spy-ey? scanners saw us coming, gave a signal to the spinnerets, and a golden spiderweb 
spurted into being from one 
shoulder of the highway to the 
other. The landcar’s sensors detected it and instantly signalled 
us to a halt. The screens showed 
a dozen pale human figures. 
“Bandits?” Olmayne asked. 
“Worse,” said tfie Merchant. 
“Traitors.” He scowled and turned to his communicator Horn. 
“What is it?” He demanded. 
“Get out for inspection.” 
“By whose writ?” 
“The Procurator of Marsay,” 
came the reply. 
It was an ugly thing to behold: Human beings acting as 
road-agents for the invaders. But 
it was inevitable that we should 
Have begun to drift into their 
civil service, since work was 
scarce, especially for those who 
had been in the defensive guilds. 
The Merchant was stormy-faced 
with rage, but He was stymied, 
unable to pass the checkpoint’s 
web. “I go armed,” he whispered 
to us. “Wait inside and fear 
nothing.” 
He got out and engaged in a 
lengthy discussion, of which we 
could hear nothing, with the highway guards. At length some impasse must have forced recourse 
to higher authority, for three invaders abruptly appeared, waved 
their hired collaborators away 
and surrounded the Merchant. 
His demeanor changed; his face 
grew oily and sly, his hands 
moved rapidly in eloquent gestures, his eyes glistened. He led 
the three interrogators to the car, 
opened it and showed them his 
two passengers. The invaders appeared puzzled by the sight of
Pilgrims amid such opulence, but 
they did not ask us to step out. 
After some further conversation, 
the Merchant rejoined us and 
sealed the car; the web was dissolved, and we sped toward Marsay. 
A s we gained velocity he muttered curses and said, “Do 
you know How I’d handle that 
long-armed filth? All we need is 
a coordinated plan. A night of 
knives. Every ten Earthmen make 
themselves responsible for taking out one invader. We’d get 
them all.” 
“Why Has no one organized 
such a movement?” I asked. 
“It’s the job of the Defenders, 
and half of them are dead and 
the other half in the pay of them. 
It’s not my place to set up a resistance movement. But that’s 
how it should be done. Guerrilla 
action: sneak up behind ’em, give 
’em the knife.” 
“More invaders would come,” 
Olmayne said morosely. 
“Treat ’em the same way!” 
“They would retaliate with fire. 
They would destroy our world,” 
she said. 
“These invaders pretend to be 
civilized, more civilized than ourselves,” the Merchant replied. 
“Such barbarity would give them 
a bad name on a million worlds. 
No, they wouldn’t come with 
fire. They’d just get tired of h'av
21 
mg to conquer us over and over, 
of losing so many men. And they 
would go away, and we’d be free 
again.” 
“Without having won redemption for our ancient sins,” I said. 
“What’s that, old man. What’s 
that?” 
“Mere bloody resistance would 
thwart the scheme the Will has 
devised for us. We must earn our 
freedom in a nobler way. We were 
not given this ordeal simply so 
that we might practice slitting 
throats.” He snorted. “I should 
have remembered. I’m talking to 
Pilgrims. All right. Forget it all. 
I wasn’t serious, anyway. Maybe 
you like the world the way it is, 
for all I know.” 
“I do not,” I said. 
He glanced at Olmayne. So did 
I; for I half expected her to tell 
the Merchant that I had already 
done my bit of collaborating with 
our conquerors. But Olmayne fortunately was silent on that topic, 
then. 
We left oUr benefactor in Marsay, spent the night in a Pilgrim 
hostelry and set out on foot along 
the coast the next morning. So 
we traveled, Olmayne and I, 
through pleasant lands swarming 
with invaders. And so we came 
to Land Bridge and met delay 
and had our frosty moment of 
bickering and then were permitted to go on across that narrow 
tongue of sandy ground that links 
22 
the lake-sundered continents. 
And so we crossed' into Afreek, at 
last. ,, 
IV 
/Okur first night on the other 
side, after our long and 
dusty crossing, we tumbled into 
a grimy inn near the lake’s edge. 
Most of its clientele appeared to 
be Pilgrims, but there were some 
members of other guilds, chiefly 
Vendors and Transporters. At a 
room near the turning of the 
building there stayed a Rememberer whom Olmayne avoided 
even though she did not know 
him; she simply did not wish to 
be reminded of her former guild. 
Among these who took lodging there was the Changeling Bernalt. Under the new laws of the invaders, Changelings might stay at 
any public inn, not merely those 
set aside for their special use; 
yet it seemed a little strange to 
see him here. We passed in the 
corridor. Bernalt gave me a tentative smile, as though about to 
speak again, but the smile died 
and the glow left his eyes. He 
appeared to realize I was not 
ready to accept his friendship. 
Or perhaps he merely recalled 
that Pilgrims, by the laws of their 
guild, were not supposed to have 
much to do with guildless ones. 
That law still stood. 
We had a greasy meal of soups 
GALAXY 
and stews. Afterward I saw her to 
her room and began to wish her 
good night when she said, “Wait. 
We’ll do our communion together.” 
“I’ve been seen coming into 
your room,” I pointed out. “There 
will be whispering if I stay long.” 
“We’ll go to yours, then!” 
Olmayne peered into the Hall. 
All clear. She seized my wrist 
and we rushed toward my chamber, across the way. Closing and 
sealing the warped door, she said, 
“Your starstone, now!” 
I took the stone from its hiding 
place in my robe, and she produced hers, and our hands closed 
upon them. 
During this time of Pilgrimage 
I had found the starstone a great 
comfort. Many seasons now had 
passed since I had last entered a 
Watcher’s trance, but I was not 
yet reconciled entirely to the 
breaking of my old habit; the 
starstone provided a kind of substitute for the swooping ecstasy 
I had known in Watching. 
No Pilgrim is ever without his 
stone. They come from one of the 
outer worlds and may be had 
only by application to the guild. 
We waited for the stones to 
overwhelm us. I gripped mine 
tightly. Dark, shining, more 
smooth than glass, it glowed in 
my grasp like a pellet of ice, and 
I felt myself becoming attuned to 
the power of the Will.
First came a heightened perception of my surroundings.
Every crack in the walls of this 
ancient inn seemed now a valley. 
The soft wail of the wind outside 
rose to a keen pitch. In the dim 
glow of the room’s lamp I saw 
colors beyond the spectrum. 
When I let myself be drawn 
into the stone’s effect, I was engulfed by something far larger 
than myself I was in direct contact with the matrix of the universe. 
Call it communion with the 
Will. 
From a great distance I heard 
Olmayne say, “Do you believe 
what some people say of these 
stones? That there is no communion, that it’s all an electrical 
deception?” 
“I have no theory about that,” 
I said. “I am less interested in 
causes than in effects.” 
Skeptics say that the starstones 
are nothing more than amplifying 
loops which bounce a man’s own 
brain-waves back into his mind; 
the awesome oceanic entity with 
which one comes in contact, these 
scoffers hold, is merely the thunderous recycling oscillation of a 
single shuttling electrical pulse 
beneath the roof of the Pilgrim’s 
own skull. Perhaps. 
Olmayne extended the hand 
that grippd her stone. She said, 
“When you were among the Rememberers, Tomis, did you study 
the history of early religion? All 
through time, man has sought 
union with the infinite. Many religions have held forth the hope 
of such a divine merging.” 
“And there were drugs, too,” 
I murmured. 
“Certain drugs, yes, cherished 
for their ability to bring the taker 
momentarily to a sensation of 
oneness with the universe. These 
starstones, Tomis, are only the 
latest in a long sequence of devices for overcoming the greatest 
of human curses* that is, the confinement of each individual soul 
within a single body. Our terrible 
isolation from one another and 
from the Will itself is more than 
most races of the unverse would 
be able to bear.” 
IT er voice grew vague. She said 
much more, speaking to me 
out of the wisdom she had learned with the Rememberers, but her 
meaning eluded me ; I was always 
quicker to enter communion than 
she, because of my training as a 
Watcher, and often her final 
words did not register. 
That night as on other nights 
I seized my stone and felt the 
gong, the lapping of waves on an 
unknown beach, the whisper of 
the wind in an alien forest. And 
felt a summons. I yielded. And 
entered the state of communion. 
And gave myself up to the Will. 
I slipped down through the layers
of my life, through my youth and 
middle years, my wanderings, my 
old loves, my torments, my joys, 
my troubled later years, my treasons, my insufficiencies, my griefs* 
my imperfections. 
I freed myself of myself. And 
shed my selfness. And mcrgech 
And became one with thousands 
of Pilgrims, not merely Olmayne 
nearby, but others trekking the 
mountains of Hind and the sands 
of Arba, Pilgrims at their devotions in Ais and Palash and Stralya, Pilgrims moving toward Jorslem on the journey that some 
complete in months, some in 
years, and some never at all. I 
shared with all of them the instant of submergence into the 
Will. And saw in the darkness a 
deep purple glow on the horizon, 
which grew in intensity until it 
became an all-encompassing red 
brilliance. And went into it, 
though unworthy, unclean, fleshtrapped. 
I was purified. 
And awakened alone. 
V 
I knew Afreek well. When still a 
young man I had settled in 
the continent’s dark heart. Out 
of restlessness I had left, finally, 
going as far north as Agupt. I 
did my Watching and went about 
from place to place, and chance 
brought me in contact with a lit
GALAXY 
tie Flier girl just as I was ready 
to roam again, and so I left Agupt 
for Roum and then Perris. 
Now I Had come back with Olmayne. We kept close to the 
coast, avoiding the sandy inland 
wastes. As Pilgrims we were immune from most of the Hazards 
of travel ; we would never go hungry or without shelter, even in a 
place where no lodge for our 
guild existed, and all owed us 
respect. Olmayne’s great beauty 
might have been a hazard to her, 
traveling as she was with no escort other than a shriveled old 
man, but behind the mask and 
robe of a Pilgrim she was safe. 
We unmasked only rarely, and 
never where we might be seen. 
Within our lodgings she was 
careless of her virtue. We never 
shared a room — no Pilgrim Hostelry would permit it — but we 
usually had adjoining ones, and 
she summoned me to hers or 
came to mine whenever the mood 
took her. Only once did it seem 
to occur to her that I might ever 
have been young enough to feel 
desire. She looked my scrawny, 
shrunken body over and said, 
“How will you look, I wonder, 
when you’ve been renewed in 
Jorslem? I’m trying to picture 
you young, Tomis. Will you give 
me pleasure then?” 
“I gave pleasure in my time,” 
I said obliquely. 
Olmayne disliked the heat and
dryness of Agupt. We traveled 
meanly by night and clung to our 
Hostelries by day. The roads were 
crowded at all hours. The press 
of Pilgrims towards Jorslem was 
extraordinarily heavy. Olmayne 
and I speculated on how long it 
might take us to gain access to 
the waters of renewal at such a 
time. 
“They say they don’t admit all 
who come,” she mused. 
“Renewal is a privilege, not a 
right,” I said. “Many are turned 
away.” 
“I understand also,” said Olmayne, “that not all who enter 
the waters are successfully renewed.” 
“I know little of this.” 
“Some grow older instead of 
younger. Some grow young too 
fast and perish. There are risks.” 
“Would you not take those 
risks?” 
She laughed. “Only a fool 
would hesitate.” Her face clouded. “If the city is full of Pilgrims, maybe they won’t let me 
into the house of renewal at all! 
They’ll say I’m too young — 
tell me to come back in forty or 
fifty years. Tomis, would they do 
that to me?” 
“It is hard for me to say.” 
The trembled. “They’ll let you 
in. You’re a walking corpse already — they have to renew you! 
But me — Tomis, I won’t let 
them turn me away! If I have to 
pull Jorslem down stone by 
stone, I’ll get in somehow!” 
I wondered privately if her soul 
were in fit condition for one who 
poses as a candidate for renewal. 
Humility is recommended when 
one becomes a Pilgrim. But I had 
no wish to fell Olmayne’s fury, 
and I kept my silence. Perhaps 
they would admit her to renewal 
despite her flaws. I had concerns 
of my own. It was vanity that 
drove Olmayne; my own goals 
were different. I had wandered 
long and done much, not all of 
it virtuous; I needed a cleansing 
of my conscience in the holy city 
more, perhaps, than I did a lessening of my years. 
Or was it only vanity for me 
to think so? 
VI 
Qeveral days eastward of that 
^ place, as Olmayne and I 
walked through a parched countryside, village children rushed 
upon us, chattering in fear and 
excitement. 
“Please, come, come!” they 
cried. “Pilgrims, come!” 
Olmayne looked bewildered 
and irritated. “What are they 
saying, Tomis? I can’t get 
through their damnable Aguptan 
accents!” 
“They want us to help,” I said. 
I listened to their shouts. “In 
their village,” I told Olmayne,
“there is an outbreak of the crystallization disease. They wish to 
seek the mercies of the Will upon the sufferers.” 
Olmayne drew back. She flicked out her hands, trying to keep 
the children from touching her. 
To me she said, “We can’t go 
there!” 
“We must.” 
“We’re in a hurry! Jorslem’s 
crowded; I don’t want to waste 
time in some dreary village.” 
“They need us, Olmayne.” 
“Are we Surgeons?” 
“We are Pilgrims,” I said 
quietly. “The benefits we gain 
from that carry certain obligations. If we are entitled to the 
hospitality of all we meet, we 
must also place our souls at the 
free disposal of the humble. 
Come.” 
“I won’t go!” 
“How will that sound in Jorslem, when you give an accounting 
of yourself, Olmayne?” 
“It’s a hideous disease. What if 
we get it?” 
“Is that what troubles you? 
Trust in the Will! How can you 
expect renewal if your soul is so 
deficient in grace?” 
“May you rot, Tomis,” she 
said in a low voice. “When did 
you become so pious? You’re doing this deliberately, because of 
what I said to you by Land 
Bridge. In a stupid moment I 
taunted you, and now you’re will
ing to expose us both to a ghastly 
affliction for your revenge.” 
“TEe children are growing agitated, Olmayne. Will you wait 
Here for me, or will you go on 
to the next village and wait in 
tEe hostelry there?” 
“Don’t leave me alone in the 
middle of nowhere!” 
“I have to go to the sick ones,” 
I said. 
In the end she accompanied 
me ■ — I think not out of any suddenly conceived desire to be of 
help, but rather out of fear that 
her selfish refusal might somehow 
be held against her in Jorslem. 
We came shortly to the village, 
which was small and decayed. 
Shivering with heat we followed the children to the houses of 
sickness. 
''Tphe crystallization disease is an 
unlovely gift from the stars. 
Not many afflictions of outworlders affect the Earthborn; but 
from the world of the Spear came 
this ailment, carried by alien 
tourists, and the disease has settled among us. If it had come 
during the days of the Second 
Cycle we might have eradicated 
it in a day; but our skills are 
dulled now. Olmayne was plainly 
terrified as we entered the first 
of the clay huts where the victims 
were kept. 
There is no hope for one who 
has contracted this disease. One
merely hopes that the Healthy will 
be spared; and fortunately it is 
not a highly contagious disease. 
It works insidiously, transmitted 
in an unknown way. The first 
symptom is a scaliness of the 
skin: itch, flakes upon the clothing, inflammation. There follows 
a weakness in the bones as the 
calcium is dissolved. One grows 
limp and rubbery, but this is 
still an early phase. Soon the outer tissues harden. Thick opaque 
membranes form on the surface of 
the eyes; the nostrils may close 
and seal; the skin grows coarse 
and pebbled. In this phase prophecy is common. The sufferer partakes of the skills of a Somnambulist and utters oracles. The 
soul may wander, separating from 
the body for hours at a time, although the life-processes continue. Next, within twenty days 
after the onset of the disease, the 
crystallization occurs. While the 
skeletal structure dissolves, the 
skin splits and cracks, forming 
shining crytals in rigid geometrical patterns. The victim is quite 
beautiful at this time, taking on 
the appearance of a replica of 
himself in precious gems. The 
crystals glow with rich inner 
lights, violet and green and red; 
their sharp facets adopt new 
alignments from hour to hour; 
the slightest illumination in the 
room causes the sufferer to give 
off brilliant glittering reflections 
fiat dazzle and delight tfie eye. 
U1 this time tfie internal body 
s changing, as if some strange , 
hrysalis is forming. Miraculousy the organs sustain life through>ut every transformation, alhough in the crystalline phase 
lie victim is no longer able to 
ximmunicate with others and 
>ossibly is unaware of the 
Changes in himself. Ultimately the 
netamorphosis reaches the vital 
irgans, and the process fails. The 
ilien infestation is unable to 
eshape those organs without 
rilling its host. The crisis is swift; 
i brief convulsion, a final dis:harge of energy along the nerv>us system of the crystallzed one, 
md there is a quick arching of 
he body, accompanied by the 
lelicate tinkling sounds of shivering glass, and then all is over. 
Dn the planet to which this is 
lative, crystallization is not a disease but an actual metamorphosis, the result of thousands of 
/ears of evolution toward a symbiotic relationship. 
Since the process is irreversible, 
Dlmayne and I could do nothing 
jf value here except offer consolation to these ignorant and 
frightened people. There were 
i/ictims in all stages, from the 
first rash to the ultimate crystallization. They were arranged 
n the hut accordng to their in:ensity of their infestation. To my 
eft was a somber row of victims, 
28 
fully conscious and morbidly 
scratching their arms as they 
contemplated the horrors that 
awaited them. Along the rear 
wall were five pallets on which 
lay villagers in the coarse-skinned and prophetic phase. To my 
right were those in varying degrees of crystallization, and up 
front, the diadem of the lot, was 
one who clearly was in his last 
hours of life. His body shimmered 
in almost painful beauty, encrusted with false emeralds and rubies 
and opals; he scarcely moved. 
Within that shell of wondrous 
color he was lost in some dream 
of ecstasy, finding at the end of 
his days more passion, more delight, than he could ever have 
known in all his harsh peasant 
years. 
UTfs horrible,” Olmayne whis-®- pered. “I won’t go in!” 
“We must. We are under obligation.” 
“I never wanted to be a Pilgrim!” 
“You wanted atonement,” I 
reminded her. “It must be earned.” 
“We’ll catch the disease!” 
The Will can reach' us anywhere to infect us with this, Olmayne. It strikes at random. The 
danger is no greater for us inside this building than it is in 
Perris.” 
We entered, Olmayne still reGALAXY 
luctant. Now fear assailed me, 
but I concealed it. 
I forced myself to be tranquil. 
THere are redemptions and redemptions, I told myself. If this 
disease is to be the source of 
mine, I will abide by the Will. 
We passed from pallet to pallet, heads bowed, starstones in 
our hands. We said words. We 
smiled when the newly sick begged reassurance. We offered prayers. Olmayne paused before one 
girl in the secondary phase, whose 
eyes already were filming over 
with homy tissue, and knelt, and 
touched her starstone to the girl’s 
scaly cheek. The girl spoke in oracles, but unhappily not in any 
language we understood. 
At last we came to the terminal 
case, he who had grown his own 
superb sarcophagus. Somehow I 
felt purged of fear, and so too 
was Olmayne, for we stood a 
long while ..before the grotesque 
sight, silent, and then she whispered, “How terrible! How wonderful! How beautiful!” 
Three more huts similar to this 
one awaited us. 
The villagers clustered at the 
doorways. As we emerged from 
each building in turn, the healthy 
ones fell down about us, clutching at the hems of our robes, 
stridently demanding that we intercede for them with the Will. 
We spoke such words as seemed 
appropriate and not too insincere. Those within the Sluts received our words blankly, as if
they already realized there was 
no chance for them; those outside, 
still untouched by, the disease, 
clung to every syllable. The headman of the village — only an acting headman; the true chief lay 
crystallized — thanked us again 
and again, as though we had done 
something real. At least we gave 
comfort, which is not to be despised. 
W hen we came forth from the 
last of the sickhouses we 
saw a slight figure watching us 
from a distance — the Changeling Bernalt. Olmayne nudged 
me. 
“That creature has been following us, Tomis. All the way 
from Land Bridge!” 
“He travels to Jorslem also.” 
“Yes, but why should he stop 
here? Why in this awful place?” 
“Hush, Olmayne. Be civil to 
him now.” 
“To a Channeling?” 
I glared at her. Bernalt approached. The mutated one was 
clad in a soft white robe that 
blunted the strangeness of his 
appearance. He nodded sadly 
toward the village and said, “A 
great tragedy. The Will lies heavy 
on this place.” 
He explained that he Had arrived here several days ago and 
had met a friend from his native 
city of Nayrub. I assumed He 
meant a CHangeling; but no 
Bernalt’s friend was a Surgeon, 
He said, wHo Had Halted Here to 
do what He could for tKe afflicted 
villagers. The idea of a friendship between a Changeling and a 
Surgeon seemed a bit odd to me, 
and positively contemptible to 
Olmayne, who did not trouble to 
hide her loathing of Bemalt. 
A partly crystallized figure 
staggered from one of the huts, 
gnarled hands clutching. Bernalt 
went forward and gently guided 
it back within. Returning to us, 
he said, “There are times one is 
actually glad one is a Changeling. That disease does not affect us, you know.” His eyes 
acquired a sudden glitter. “Am 
I forcing myself on you, Pilgrims? 
You seem like stone behind your 
masks. I mean no harm; shall 
I withdraw?” 
“Of course not,” I said, meaning the opposite. His company 
disturbed me; perhaps the ordinary disdain for Changelings 
was a contagion that Had at last 
reached me. “Stay a while. I 
would ask you to travel with us 
to Jorslem, but you know it is 
forbidden for us.” 
“Certainly. I quite understand.” 
He was coolly polite, but the 
seething bitterness in his was close 
to the surface. Most Changelings 
are such degraded bestial things 
that they are incapable of know30 
ing How detested they are by 
normal guided men and women; 
but Bemalt clearly was gifted 
with the torment of comprehension. He smiled, and then He 
pointed. “My friend is Here.” 
Three figures approached. One 
was Bernalt’s Surgeon, a slender 
man, dark-skinned, soft-voiced, 
with 1 weary eyes and sparse yellow hair. With Him were an official of the invaders and another outworlder from a different 
planet. “I had Heard that two Pilgrims were summoned to this 
place,” said the invader. “I am 
grateful for the comfort you Have 
brought these sufferers. I am 
Earth claim Nineteen; this district 
is under my administration. Will 
you be my guests at dinner this 
night?” 
I was doubtful of taking an invader’s hospitality, and Olmayne’s sudden clenching of her 
fist over Her starstone told me 
that she also hesitated. Earthclaim Nineteen seemed eager for 
our acceptance. He was not as 
tall as most of his kind, and His 
malproportioned arms reached 
below his knees. Under the blazing Aguptan sun, his thick waxy 
skin acquired a high gloss, although he did not perspire. 
Into a long, tense and awkward silence the Surgeon insertted: “No need to hold back. In 
this village we all are brothers. 
Join us tonight, will you?” 
W e did. EartKclaim Nineteen 
occupied a villa by the shore 
of Lake Medit; in the clear light 
of late afternoon I thought I 
could detect Land Bridge jutting 
forward to my left, and even Eyrop at the far side of the lake. 
We were waited upon by members of the guild of Servitors who 
brought us cool drinks on the 
patio. The invader had a large 
staff, all Earthborn; to me it was 
another sign that our conquest 
had become institutionalized, and 
was wholly accepted by the bulk 
of the populace. Until long after 
dusk we talked, lingering over 
drinks even as the writhing auroras danced into view to herald 
the night. Bernalt the Changeling 
remained apart, though, perhaps 
ill at east in our presence. Olmayne too was moody and withdrawn ; a mingled depression and 
exaltation had settled over her 
in the stricken village, and the 
presence of Bernalt at the dinner 
party had reinforced her silence, 
for she had no idea how to be 
polite in the presence of a Changeling. The invader, our host, was 
charming and attentive, trying to 
bring her forth from her bleakness. I had seen charming conquerors before. I had traveled 
with one who posed as the Earthborn Changeling Gormon, in the 
days just before the conquest. 
This one, Earthclaim Nineteen, 
had been a poet on his native
world in those days. I said, “It 
seems unlikely that one of your; 
inclinations would care to be part 
of a military occupation.” 
“All experiences strengthen the 
art,” said Earthclaim Nineteen. 
“I seek to expand myself. In any 
case I am not a warrior but an 
administrator. Is it so strange 
that a poet can be an administrator, or an administrator a poet?” 
He laughed. “Among your many 
guilds, there is no guild of Poets. 
Why?” 
“There are Communicants,” 
I said. “They serve the muse.” 
But in a religious way. They 
are interpreters of the Will, not 
of their own souls. This stuff of 
your Communicants is too limited in scope; it deals only with 
acquiescence to the Will. There 
are other themes for poetry besides immersion of the Will, my 
friends. The love of person for 
person, the joy of defending one’s 
home, the wonder of standing 
naked beneath the fiery stars — ” 
The invader laughed. “Can it be 
that Earth fell so swiftly because 
its only poets were poets of acquiescence to destiny?” 
“Earth fell,” said the Surgeon, 
“because the Will required us to 
atone for the sin of our ancestors 
committed when they treated 
your ancestors like beasts. The 
quality of our poetry had nothing to do with it.” 
“The Will decreed that you 
would lose to us by way of punishment, eh? But if the Will is 
omnipotent, it must have decreed the sin of your ancestors 
that made the punishment necessary. Eh? You see the difficulty 
of believing in a divine force that 
determines all events? Where is 
the element of choice that makes 
suffering meaningful? To force 
you into a sin, and then to require you to endure defeat as 
atonement, seems to me an empty 
exercise. Forgive my blasphemy.” 
The Surgeon said, “You misunderstand. All that has happened on this planet is part of a process of moral instruction. The 
Will simply provides the raw material of events and allows us to 
follow such patterns as we desire.” 
“Example?” 
“The Will imbued the Earthborn with skills and knowledge. 
During the First Cycle we rose 
from savagery in little time; in 
the Second Cycle we attained 
greatness. In our moment of 
greatness we grew swollen with 1 
pride, choosing to exceed our 
limitations. We imprisoned intelligent creatures of other worlds 
under the pretense of study, when 
we acted really out of an arrogant 
desire for amusement; and we 
toyed with our world’s climate 
until oceans joined and continents sank and our old! civilization 
was destroyed. Thus the Will 
32 
instructed us in the boundaries 
of human ambition.” 
“I dislike that dark philosophy 
even more,” said Earthclaim 
Nineteen. “I — ” 
“Let me finish,” said the Surgeon. “The collapse of Second 
Cycle Earth was our punishment. 
The defeat of Third Cycle by 
you folk from the stars is a completion of that earlier punishment, but also the beginning of a 
new phase. You are the instruments of our redemption. By inflicting on us the final humiliation of conquest, you bring us to 
the bottom of our trough; now 
we renew our souls, now we begin 
to rise, tested by adversities.” 
1 stared in sudden amazement at 
this Surgeon, who was uttering ideas that had been stirring 
in me all along the road to Jorslem, ideas of redemption both 
personal and planetary. I had 
paid little attention to the Surgeon before Now I wanted to 
draw him aside and hear more 
on these themes; but the conversation swept by too swiftly. 
“Permit me a statement,” 
Bernalt said suddenly, his first 
words in hours. 
We looked at him. Tlie pigmented bands in his face were 
ablaze, marking his emotion. 
He said, nodding to the Surgeon, “My friend, you speak of 
redemption for the Earthborn. 
Do you mean all Earthborn, or 
only the guilded' ones?” 
“All Earthborn, of course,” 
said the Surgeon mildly. “Are we 
not all equally conquered?” 
“We are not equal in other 
things, though. Can there be redemption for a planet that keeps 
millions of its people thrust into 
guildlessness? I speak of my own 
folk, of course. We sinned long 
ago, thinking we were striking out 
against those who had created us 
as monsters. We strove to take 
Jorslem from you; and for this 
we were punished, and our punishment has lasted for a thousand 
years. We are still outcasts, are 
we not? Where has our hope of 
redemption been? Can you guilded ones consider yourself purified 
and made virtuous by your recent 
suffering, when you still step on 
us?” 
The Surgeon looked dismayed. 
“You speak rashly, Bernalt. I 
know the Changelings have a 
grievance. But you know as well 
as I that your time of deliverance 
is at hand. In the days to come 
no Earthborn one will scorn you, 
and you will stand beside us when 
we regain our freedom.” 
Bernalt peered at the floor. 
“Forgive me, my friend. Of 
course, you speak the truth. I 
was carried away. The heat — 
this splendid wine — how foolishly I spoke!” 
Earthclaim Nineteen said,
“Are you telling me that a resistance movement is forming 
that will shortly drive us from 
your planet?” 
“I only speak in abstract 
terms,” said the Surgeon. 
“I think your resistance movement will be purely abstract, 
too,” the invader replied easily. 
“Forgive me, but I see little 
strength in a planet that could 
be conquered in a single night. 
We expect our occupation of Earth 
to be a long one and to meet little opposition. In the months 
that we have been here there has 
been no sign of increasing hostility to us. Quite the contrary: we 
are increasingly accepted among 
you.” 
“It is a part of a process,” said 
the Surgeon. “As a poet, you 
should understand that words 
carry meanings of many kinds. 
We do not need to overthrow our 
alien masters in order to be free 
of them. Is that poetic enough 
for you?” 
“Splendid,” said Earthclaim 
Nineteen, getting to his feet. 
“Shall we go to dinner now?” 
VII 
W hen we left the villa in the 
morning, the Surgeon asked 
permission to join our Pilgrimage. 
“There is nothing further I can 
do here,” he explained. “At the. 
outbreak of the disease I came up 
from my home in Nayrub, and 
I’ve been here many days, more 
to console than to cure, of course. 
Now I am called to Jorslem. 
However, if it violates your vows 
to have company on the road — ” 
“By all means come with us,” 
I said. 
“There will be one other companion,” the Surgeon told us. 
He meant the third person who 
had met us at the village: the 
outworlder, an enigma, still to 
say a first word in our presence. 
This being was a flattened spikeshaped creature somewhat taller 
than a man, mounted on a jointed tripod of angular legs; its place 
of origin was in the Golden Spiral; its skin was rough and bright 
red in hue, and the vertical rows 
of glassy oval eyes descended on 
three sides from the top of its 
tapered head. I Had never seen 
Such 1 a creature before. It had 
come to Earth, according to the 
Surgeon, on a data-gathering 
mission, and had already roamed 
much of Ais and Stralya. Now it 
was touring the lands on the 
margin of Lake Medit; and after 
seeing Jorslem it would depart 
for the great cities of Eyrop. Solemn, unsettling in its perpetual 
watchfulnss, never bl inking its 
many eyes nor offering a comment on what those eyes beheld, 
it seemed more like some odd 
take for a memory tank, than a 
machine, some information-in34 
living creature. But it was harmless enough', so we let it come 
with us to the Holy city. 
The Surgeon bade farewell to 
his Changeling friend, who went 
on alone ahead of us, and paid 
a final call on the crystallized 
village. We stayed back, since 
there was no point in our going. 
When he returned, his face was 
somber. Four new cases, ”he said. 
“This entire village will perish.” 
Olmayne examined herself 
from day to day for symptoms of 
the disease, but none appeared. 
She gave the Surgeon much trouble on that score, bothering him 
for opinions concerning real or 
fancied blemishes of her skin, embarrassing him by removing her 
mask in his presence so that he 
could determine that some speck 
on her cheek was not the first 
trace of crystallization. 
The Surgeon took all this in 
good grace; while the outworld 
being was merely a cipher plodding alongside us, the Surgeon 
was a man of depth, patience and 
sophistication. He was native to 
Afreek and had been dedicated 
to his guild at birth by his father. Traveling widely, he Had 
seen most of our world and had 
forgotten little of what he had 
seen. He spoke to us of Roum and 
Perris, of the frostflower fields 
of Strayla, of my own birthplace 
in the western island group of the 
Lost Continents. He questioned 
us tactfully about our starstones 
and the effects they produced — 
I could see lie hungered to try the 
stone himself, but of course was 
forbidden to one who had not 
declared himself a Pilgrim — and 
when he learned that in former 
life I had been a Watcher, he 
asked me a great deal concerning 
the instruments by which I had 
scanned the heavens for invasions, wishing to know what it 
was I perceived and how I imagined the perception was accomplished. I spoke to him as fully 
as I could on these matters, 
though in truth I knew little. 
T Tsually we kept to the green 
strip of fertile land bordering the lake, but once, at the Surgeon’s insistence, ive detoured into the choking desert to see something that he promised would be 
of interest. He would not tell us 
what it was. We were at this point 
traveling in hired rollerwagons, 
open on top, and sharp winds 
blew gust of sand in our faces. 
Sand adhered briefly to the outworlder’s eyes, I saw; and I saw 
How efficiently it flushed each 
eye with a flood of blue tears every few moments. The rest of us 
huddled in our garments, Heads 
down, whenever the wind arose. 
“We are here,” the Surgeon 
announced finally. “When I traveled with my father I first visited 
this place long ago. We will go
inside — and then you, the former 
Rememberer, will tell us where 
we are.” 
It was a building two stories 
High made of bricks of white 
glass. The doors appeared sealed, 
but they gave at the slightest 
pressure. Lights glowed into life 
the moment we entered. 
In long aisles, lightly strewn 
with sand, were tables on which 
instruments were mounted. Nothing was comprehensible to me. 
There were devices shaped like 
hands, into which one’s own 
Hands could be inserted; conduits 
led from the strange metal gloves 
to shining closed cabinets, and arrangements of mirrors transmitted images from the interiors of 
those cabinets to giant screens 
overhead. The Surgeon placed 
his hands in the gloves and 
moved his fingers; the screens 
brightened, and I saw images of 
tiny needles moving through shallow arcs. He went to other machines that released dribbles of 
unknown fluids; he touched small 
buttons that produced musical 
sounds.; he moved freely through 
a laboratory of wonders, clearly 
ancient, which seemed still in order and awaiting the return of its 
users. 
Olmayne was ecstatic. She followed the Surgeon from aisle to 
aisle, handling everything. 
“Well, Rememberers?” he asked finally. “What is this?” 
“A Surgery/’ she said in lowered voice. A Surgery of the Years 
of Magic!” 
“Exactly! Splendid!” He seemed in an oddly excited state. “We 
could make dazzling monsters 
here! We could work miracles! 
Fliers, Swimmers, Changelings, 
Twiners, Burners, Climbers! Invent your own guilds, shape men 
to your whims! This was the 
place!” 
Olmayne said, “These Surgeries have been described to me. 
There are six of them left, one 
in northern Eyrop, one on Palash, 
one here, one far to the south in 
Deeper Afreek, one in western 
Ais — ” She faltered. 
“And one in Hind, the greatest 
of all,” said the Surgeon. 
“Yes, of course, Hind! The 
home of the Fliers!” 
Their awe was contagious. I 
said, “This was where the shapes 
of men were changed? How was 
it done?” 
The Surgeon shrugged. “The 
art is lost. The Years of Magic 
were long ago, old man.” 
“But surely if the equipment 
survives, we could guess how — ” 
“With these knives,” said the 
Surgeon, “we cut into the fabric 
of the unborn, editing the human 
seed. The Surgeon placed his 
hands here and within that incubator the knives did their work. 
Out of this came Fliers and all 
the rest. The forms bred true. 
36 
Some are extinct today, but out 
Fliers and our Changelings owe 
their heritage to some building as 
this. The Changelings, of course, 
were the Surgeon’s mistakes. 
They should not have been permitted to live.” 
“I thought that these monsters 
were the products of ter ato genetic drugs, given to them when 
they still were within the womb,” 
I said. “You tell me now that 
Changelings were made by Surgeons. Which is so?” 
“Both,” he replied. “All 
Changelings today are descended 
from the flaws and errors committed by the Surgeons of the 
Years of Magic. Yet mothers in 
that unhappy group often enhance the monstrousness of their 
children with drugs, so that they 
will be more marketable. It is an 
ugly tribe not merely in looks. 
Small wonder that their guild 
was dissolved and they were 
thrust outside society. We — ” 
S omething bright flew through 
the air, missing his face by 
less than a hand’s breadth. He 
dropped to the floor, shouting to 
us to take cover. As I fell I .saw 
a second missile fly toward us. 
Then it struck two thirds of the 
way up the outworlder’s body and 
severed it instantly. Other me; 
siles followed, clattering against 
the wall behind us. I saw out at 
tackers: a band of Changelings, 
fierce and hideous. We were unarmed. They moved toward us. 
I readied myself to die. 
From the doorway a voice 
cried out — a familiar voice, 
using the thick and unfamiliar 
words of the language Changelings speak among themselves. 
Instantly the assault ceased. 
Those who menaced us turned 
toward the door. The Changeling 
Bernalt entered. 
“I saw your vehicle,” he said. 
“I thought you might be here, and 
perhaps in trouble. It seems I 
came in time.” 
“Not altogether,” said the Surgeon. He indicated the fallen 
outworlder, which was beyond all 
aid. “But why this attack?” 
Bernalt gestured. “ They will 
tell you.” 
We looked at the five Changelings who had ambushed us. They 
were not of the educated, civilized 
sort such as Bernalt, nor were 
any two of them of the same 
style each was a twisted, hunched mockery of the human form, 
one with ropy tendrils descending 
from his chin, one with a face 
that was a featureless void, another whose ears were giant cups, 
and so forth. From the one closest to us, a creature with’ small 
platforms jutting from his skin 
in a thousand places, we learned 
why we had been assaulted. In a 
brutal Aguptan dialect he told 
us that we had profaned a tem
pie sacred to Changelings. “We
keep out of Jorslem,” he told us. 
“Why must you come here?” 
O f course he was right. We asked his forgiveness, and the 
Surgeon explained that he had 
visited this place long ago and it 
had not been a temple then. That 
seemed to soothe the Changeling, 
who admitted that only in recent years had his kind used it 
as a shrine. He was soothed even 
more when Oimayne opened the 
overpocket fastened between her 
breasts and offered a few glittering gold coins. The bizarre and 
deformed beings were satisfied at 
that, and allowed us to leave the 
building. We would have taken 
the dead outworlder with us, but 
during our parley with the 
Changelings the body Had nearly 
vanished, nothing but a faint 
gray streak remaining on the 
sandy floor to tell us where it had 
fallen. “A mortuary enzyme,” 
the Surgeon explained. “Triggered by interruption of the life processes.” 
Others of this community of 
desert-dwelling Changelings were 
lurking about outside the building as we came forth. They were 
a tribe of nightmares, with skin 
of every texture and color, facial 
features arranged at random, all 
kinds of genetic improvisations 
of organs and bodily accessories. 
Bernalt himself, although their 
brother, seemed appalled by their 
monstrousness. They looked to 
him with awe. At the sight of us, 
some of them fondled the throwing weapons at their hips, but a 
sharp command from Bernalt 
prevented any trouble. 
He said, “I regret the treatment you received and the death! 
of the outworlder. But of course 
it is risky to enter a place that is 
sacred to backward and violent 
people.” 
“We had no idea,” the Surgeon 
said. “We never would have gone 
in if we had realized — ” 
“Of course. Of course.” Was 
there something patronizing about 
Bernalt’s soft, civilized tones? 
“Well, again I bid you farewell.” 
I blurted suddenly, “No. Travel with us to Jorslem! It’s ridiculous for us to go separately to the 
same place.” 
Olmayne gasped. Even the 
Surgeon seemed amazed. Only 
Bernalt remained calm. He said, 
“You forget, friend, that it is 
improper for Pilgrims to journey 
with the guildless. Besides, I am 
here to worship at this shrine, 
and it will take me a while. I 
would not wish to delay you.” 
His hand reached out to mine. 
Then he moved away, entering 
the ancient Surgery. Scores of his 
fellow Changelings rushed in after 
him. I was grateful to Bernalt for 
his tact; my impulsive offer of 
companionship, though sincerely 
38 
meant, had been impossible fof 
him to accept. 
We boarded our rollerwagons. 
In a moment we heard a dreadful sound: a discordant Changeling hymn in praise of I dare not 
think what deity, a scraping* 
grinding, screeching song as misshapen as those who uttered it. 
“The beasts,” Olmayne muttered. “A sacred shrine! A! 
Changeling temple! How loathsome! They might have killed 
us all, Tomis. How can such 
monsters have a religion?” 
I made no reply. The Surged! 
looked at Olmayne sadly, and 
shook his head as though distressed by so little charity on the 
part of one who claimed to be 
a Pilgrim. 
“They also are human,” he 
said. 
At the next town along our 
route we reported the starborn 
being’s death to the occupying 
authorities. Then, saddened and 
silent, we three survivors continued onward, to the place where 
the coastline trends north rather 
than east. We were leaving sleepy 
Agupt behind and entering now 
into the borders of the land in 
which holy Jorslem lies. 
VIII 
>"T''he city of Jorslem sits some 
good distance inland from 
Lake Medit, on a cool plateau 
guarded by a ring of low barren 
rock-strewn mountains. A winding road took us down through 
the encircling hills to the city, 
whose wall was made of squared 
blocks of a fine stone, dark pinkgold in color. The houses and 
shrines, too, were of this stone. 
Groves of trees bordered the road, 
road, nor were they startrees, but 
native products of Earth, as was 
fitting to this, the oldest of man’s 
cities. Older than Roum, older 
than Perris, its roots were deep in 
the First Cycle. 
Within the walls everything 
had the aspect of great antiquity. 
Jorslem alone of the world’s cities still preserves much of its 
First Cycle architecture: not 
merely broken columns and ruined aqueducts, as in Roum, but 
whole streets, covered arcades, 
towers, boulevards, that have 
lasted through every upheaval 
our world has seen. We wandered 
in wonder down’ streets paved 
with cobbled stones, into narrow 
alleys cluttered with children and 
beggars, across markets fragrant 
with spices. After an hour of this 
we felt it was time to seek lodgings, and here it was necessary 
for us to part company with the 
Surgeon, since he was ineligible 
to stay at a Pilgrim hostelry and 
it would have been costly and 
foolish for us to stay anywhere 
else. We saw him to the inn where 
he had previously booked a room.
I thanked him for his good companionship on our journey, and 
he thanked us just as gravely and 
expressed the hope that he would 
see us again in Jorslem in the days 
to come. Then Olmayne and I 
took leave of him and rented 
quarters in one of the numerous 
places catering to the Pilgrim 
trade. 
The city exists solely to serve 
Pilgrims and casual tourists, and 
so it is really one vast hostelry; 
robed Pilgrims are as common in 
Jorslem’s streets as Fliers in 
Hind. We settled and rested a 
while; then we dined, and afterward walking along a broad street 
from which we could see, to the 
east, Jorslem’s inner and most 
sacred district. There is a city 
within a city here. The most ancient part, so small it can be 
traversed in less than an hour 
on foot, is wrapped in a high wall 
of its own. Therein lie shrines 
revered by Earth’s former religions : the Christers, the Hebers, 
the Mislams. The place where the 
god of the Christers died is said 
to be there, but this may be a 
distortion wrought by time, since 
what kind of god is it that dies? 
On a high place in one corner of 
the Old City stands a gilded 
dome sacred to the Mislams, 
which is carefully tended by the 
common folk of Jorslem though 
its significance is lost. And to 
the fore part of that high place 
are the huge gray blocks of a 
stone wall worshipped by the Hebers.These things remain, but the 
ideas behind them are lost; never 
while I was among the Rememberers did I meet any scholar who 
could explain the merit of worshipping a wall or a gilded dome. 
Yet the old records assure us that 
these three First Cycle creeds 
were of great depth and richness. 
Tn the Old City, also, is a Second Cycle place that was of 
much more immediate interest to 
Olmayne and myself. As we 
stared through the darkness at 
the holy precincts, Olmayne said, 
“We should make application tomorrow at the house of renewal.” 
“I agree. I long now to give up 
some of my years.” 
She said something further, 
but I did not hear her words, for 
at that moment three Fliers passed above me, heading east. One 
was male, two female; they flew 
naked, according to the custom 
of their guild; and the Flier 
in the center of the group was a 
slim, fragile girl, mere bone and 
wings, moving with 1 a grace that 
was exceptional even for her airy 
kind. 
“Avluela!” I gasped. 
The trio of Fliers disappeared 
beyond the parapets of the Old 
City. Stunned, shaken, I clung to 
a tree for support and struggled 
for breath. 
“Tomis?” Olmayne said. “Tomis, are you ill?” 
“I know it was Avluela. They 
said she had gone back to Hind* 
but no, that was Avluela! How 
could I mistake her?” 
You’ve said that about every 
Flier you’ve seen since leaving 
Perris,” said Olmayne coldly. 
“But this time I’m certain! 
Where is a thinking cap? I must 
check with the Fliers’ lodge at 
once!” 
Olmayne’s hand rested on my 
arm. “It’s late, Tomis. You act 
feverish. Why this excitment over 
your skinny Flier, anyway? What 
did she mean to you?” 
“She — ” 
I halted, unable to put my 
meaning into words. Olmayne 
knew the story of my journey up 
out of Agupt with the girl, how 
as a celibate old Watcher I had 
conceived a kind of paternal 
fondness for her, how I had perhaps felt something more powers 
ful than that, how I had lost her 
to the false Changeling Gormon 
and how he had lost her in turn 
to the Prince of Roum. But yet 
what was Avluela to me, in 
truth? 
“Come back to the inn and 
rest,” Olmayne said. “Tomorrow 
we must seek renewal.” 
First, though, I donned a cap 
and made contact with the Fliers’ Lodge. My thoughts slipped 
through to the storage brain of 
tEe guild registry; I asked and received tEe answer I had sought. 
Avluela of tEe Fliers was indeed 
now a resident of Jorslem. “Take 
tEis message for her,” I said. “The 
Watcher she knew in Roum now 
is here as a Pilgrim and wishes 
to meet her outside the house of 
renewal at midday tomorrow.” 
With that done, I accompanied 
Olmayne to our lodgings. She 
seemed sullen and aloof, and 
when she unmasked in my room 
Her face appeared rigid with jealousy. To Olmayne all men were 
vassals, even one so shriveled and 
worn as I ; and she loathed it that 
another woman could kindle sucH 
a flame in me. When I drew forth 
my starstone, Olmayne at first 
would not join me in communion. 
Only when I began the rituals 
did she submit. But I was so 
tense that night that I was unable to make the merging with the 
Will, nor could she achieve it; 
and thus we faced one another 
glumly for half an hour, and 
abandoned the attempt and parted for the night. 
IX 
^Vne must go by one’s self to 
the house of renewal. At 
dawn I set out without Olmayne. 
In half an hour I stood before 
the golden wall of the Old City; 
in half an hour more I had finished my crossing of the inner
city’s tangled lanes. Passing before that gray wall so dear to the 
ancient Hebers, I went up onto 
the high place, going near the 
gilded dome of the vanished Mislams and, turning to the left, 
followed the stream of Pilgrims 
which already at this early hour 
was proceeding to the house of 
renewal. 
This house is a Second Cycle 
building; for it was then that 
the renewal process was conceived, and of all that era’s 
science only renewal has come 
down to us approximately as it 
must have been practiced in that 
time. Like those other few Second 
Cycle structures that survive, the 
house of renewal is supple and 
sleek, architecturally understated, 
with deft curves and smooth textures; it is without windows; it 
bears no external ornament whatever. There are many doors. 
Just inside the entrance I was 
greeted by a green-robed member 
of the guild Renewers, who are 
recruited entirely from the rank 
of Pilgrims, those who are willing to make it their life’s work to 
remain in Jorslem and aid others 
toward renewal. 
The Renewer’s voice was light 
and cheerful. “Welcome to this 
house, Pilgrim. Who are you, 
where are you from?” 
“I am the Pilgrim Tomis, formerly Tomis of the Rememberers, 
and prior to that a Watcher, 
born to the name Wuellig. I am 
native to the Lost Continents 
and have traveled widely both 
before and after beginning my 
Pilgrimage.” 
“What do you seek here?” 
“Renewal. Redemption.” 
“May the Will grant your wishes,” said the Renewer. “Come 
with me.” 
I was led through a close, dimly lit passage into a small stone 
cell. The Renewer instructed me 
to remove my mask, enter into 
a state of communion, and wait. 
I freed myself from the bronze 
grillwork and clasped my starstone tightly. The familiar sensations of communion stole over me. 
Something probed my soul. Everything was drawn forth and laid 
out as if for inspection on the 
floor of my cell: my acts of selfishness and of cowardice, my 
flaws and failings, my doubts, 
my despairs, above all the most 
shameful of my acts, the selling 
of the Rememberer document to 
the invader overlord. In this 
house one might extend one’s lifetime two or three times over; but 
why should the Renewers offer 
such benefits to anyone as lacking in merit as I? 
I remained a long while in 
contemplation of my faults. Then 
the contact broke, and a different 
Renewer, a man of remarkable 
stature, entered the cell. 
“The mercy of the Will is up
on you, friend,” he said, reaching 
forth fingers of extraordinary 
length to touch the tips of mine. 
TTThen I heard that deep voice 
’ ' and saw those white fingers 
I knew that I was in the presence 
of a man I had met briefly before, as I stood outside the gates 
of Roum in the season before the 
conquest of Earth. He had been 
a Pilgrim then, and he had invited me to join him on his 
journey to Jorslem, but I had declined, for Roum had beckoned 
to me. 
“Was your Pilgrimage an easy 
one?” I asked. 
“It was a valuable one,” he replied. “And you? You are a 
Watcher no longer, I see.” 
“I am in my third guild this 
year.” 
“With one more yet to come.” 
“Am I to join you in the Renewers, then?” 
“I did not mean that guild, 
friend Tomis. But we can talk 
more of that when your years are 
fewer. You have been approved 
for renewal, I rejoice to tell you.” 
“Despite my sins?” 
“Because of your sins, such as 
they are. At dawn tomorrow you 
enter the first of your renewal 
tanks. I will be your guide 
through your second birth. I am 
the Renewer Talmit. Go, now, 
and ask for me when you return.” 
“One question — ” 
“Yes?” 
“I made my Pilgrimage together with' a woman, Olmayne, 
formerly a Rememberer of Perris. Can you tell me if she has 
been approved for renewal as 
well?” 
I know nothing of this Olmayne.” 
“She is not a good woman,” 
I said. “She is vain, imperious, 
and cruel. But yet I think she 
is not beyond saving. Can you 
do anything to help her?” 
“I have no influence in such 
things,” Talmit said. “She must 
face interrogation like everyone 
else. I can tell you this, though: 
virtue is not the only criterion 
for renewal.” 
He showed me from the building. Cold sunlight illuminated the 
city. I was drained and depleted, 
too empty even to feel cheered 
that I had qualified for renewal. It was midday. I remembered 
my appointment with Avluela; I 
circled the house of renewal in 
rising anxiety. Would she come? 
She waited by the front of the 
building, crimson jacket, furry 
leggings, glassy bubbles on her 
feet, telltale humps on her back; 
from afar I could make her out 
to be a Flier. “Avluela!” I called. 
She whirled. She looked pale, 
thin, even younger than when I 
Had last seen her. Her eyes 
searched my face, once again
masked, and for a moment she 
was bewildered. 
“Watcher? she said. “Watcher, 
is that you?” 
“Call me Tomis now,” I told 
her. “But I am the same man. you 
knew in Agupt and Roum.” 
“Watcher! Oh, Watcher! Tomis.” She clung to me. “How long 
it’s been! So much has happened!” She sparkled now, and the 
paleness fled her cheeks. “Come, 
let’s find an inn, a place to sit 
and talk! How did you discover 
me here?” 
“Through your guild. I saw 
you overhead last night.” 
“I came here in the winter. 
I was in Perris for a while, halfway back to Hind, and then I 
changed my mind. There could 
be no going home. Now I live 
near Jorslem, and I help with — ” 
She cut her sentence sharply off. 
“Have you won renewal, Tomis?” 
T TTe descended from the high 
* ' place into a humbler part of 
the inner city. “Yes,” I said, “I 
am to be made younger. My guide 
is the Renewer Talmit — we met 
him as a Pilgrim outside Roum, 
do you remember?” 
She had forgotten that. We 
seated ourselves at an open-air 
patio adjoining an inn, and’ Servitors brought us food and wine. 
Her gaiety was infectious; I felt 
renewed just to be with Her. She 
spoke of those final cataclysmic 
days in Roum, when she had been 
taken into the place of the Prince 
as a concubine; and she told me 
of that terrible moment when 
Gorman the Changeling defeated 
the Prince of Roum on the evening of conquest, announcing 
Himself as no Changeling but an 
invader in disguise, and taking 
from the Prince at once his throne, 
his concubine, and his vision. 
“Did the Prince die?” she asked. 
“Yes, but not of his blinding.” 
I told her how that proud man 
Had fled from Roum disguised as 
a Pilgrim, and how I Had accompanied him to Perris, and how 
while we were among the Rememberers he Had involved himself 
with Olmayne and Had been slain 
by Olmayne’s husband, whose life 
was thereupon taken by his wife. 
I also saw Gormon in Perris,” I 
said'. “He goes by the name of 
Victorious Thirteen now. He is 
High in the councils of the invaders.” 
Avleula smiled. “Gormon and 
I were together only a short while 
after the conquest. When does 
your renewal begin?” 
“At dawn.” 
“Oh, Tomis, how will it be 
when you are a young man? Did 
you know that I loved you? All 
the time we traveled, all while 
I was sharing Gormon’s bed and 
consorting with the Prince, you 
were the one I wanted! But of 
course you were a Watcher, and 
it was impossible. Besides, you 
were so old. Now you no longer 
Watch’, and soon you will no 
longer be old, and — ” Her hand 
rested in mine. “I should never 
have left your side. We both 
would have been spared much 
suffering.” 
“From suffering we learn,” I 
said. 
“Yes. Yes. I see that. How long 
will your renewal take?” 
The usual time, whatever that 
may be.” 
“After that, what will you do? 
What guild will you choose? You 
can’t be a Watcher, not now.” 
“No, nor a Rememberer either. 
My guide Talmit spoke of some 
other guild, which’ he would not 
name, and assumed that I would 
enroll in it when I was done with 
renewal. I suppose he thought 
I’d stay here and join the Renewers, but he said it was another 
guild than that.” 
“Not the Renewers,” said Avluela. She leaned close. “The Redeemers,” she whispered. 
“Redeemers? That is a guild 
I do not know.” 
“It is newly founded.” 
No new guild Has been established in more than a — ” 
“This is the guild Talmit 
meant. You would be a desirable 
member. The skills you developed 
when you were a Watcher make 
you exceptionally useful.” 
“Redeemers,” I said, probing 
the mystery. “Redeemers. What 
does this guild do?” 
Avluela smiled jauntily. “It 
rescues troubled souls and saves 
unhappy worlds. But this is no 
time to talk of it. Finish your 
business in Jorslem, and everything will become clear. We rose. 
Her lips brushed mine. “This is 
the last time I’ll see you as an 
old man. It will be strange, Tomis, when you’re renewed.” 
She left me then. 
Toward evening I returned to 
my lodging. Olmayne was not in 
her room. A Servitor told me that 
she had been out all day. I waited 
until it was late; then I made my 
communion and slept, and at 
dawn I paused outside her door. 
It was sealed. I hurried to the 
house of renewal. 
X 
'Tplie Renewer Talmit met me 
within the entrance and conducted me down a corridor of 
green tile to the first renewal 
tank. “The Pilgrim Olmayne,” 
he informed me, “has been accepted for renewal and will come 
here later this day.” Talmit showed me into a small low room, close 
and humid, lit by dim blobs 
of slave-light and smelling faintly of crushed deathflower blossoms. My robe and my mask 
were taken from me, and the Renewer covered my head with a
fine golden-green mesh of some 
flimsy metal, through which Ke 
sent a current, and when he removed the mesh my hair was 
gone, my head was as glossy as 
the tiled walls. It makes insertion of the electrodes simpler,” 
Talmit explained. “You may enter the tank, now.” 
A gentle ramp led me down 
into the tank, which was a tub of 
no great size. I felt the warm soft 
slipperiness of mud beneath my 
feet, and Talmit nodded and told 
me it was irradiated regenerative 
mud, which would stimulate the 
increase of cell division that was 
to bring about my renewal, and 
I accepted it. I stretched out on 
the floor of the tank with only 
my head above the shimmering 
dark violet fluid that it contained. Talmit loomed above me, 
holding what seemed to be a mass 
of entangled copper wires, but 
as he pressed the wires to my 
bare scalp they opened as of their 
own accord and their tips sought 
my skull, burrowing down 
through skin and bone into the 
hidden wrinkled grayness. I felt 
nothing more than tiny prickling 
sensations. 
“The electrodes,” Talmit explained, “seek out the centers of 
ageing within your brain; we 
transmit signals that will induce 
a reversal of the normal processes of decay, and your brain 
will lose its perception of the direction of the flow of time. Your
body thus will become more receptive to the stimulation it receives from the environment of 
the renewal tank. Close your 
eyes.” 
Over my face he placed a 
breathing mask. He gave me a 
gentle shove, and the back of 
my head slipped from the edge of 
the tank, so that I floated out 
into the middle. The warmth increased. I dimly heard bubbling 
sounds. I imagined black sulfurous bubbles coming up from the 
mud through the fluid in which 
I floated; I imagined that the 
fluid had turned the color of 
mud. Adrift in a tideless sea I lay, 
distantly aware that a current 
was passing over the electrodes, 
that something was tickling my 
brain, that I was engulfed in mud 
and in what could well have been 
an amniotic fluid. From far away 
came the deep voice of the Renewer Talmit, summoning me to 
youth, drawing me back across 
the decades, unreeling time for 
me. There was a taste of salt in 
my mouth. 
Again I was crossing Earth 
Ocean, beset by pirates, defending my Watching equipment 
against their jeers and thrusts. 
Again I stood beneath the hot 
Aguptan sun meeting Avluela for 
the first time. I lived once more 
on Palash. I returned to the place 
of my birth in the western isles of
the Lost Continents, in what formerly had been Usa-amrik. I 
watched Roum fall a second 
time. Fragments of memories 
swam through my softening brain. 
There was no sequence, no rational unrolling of events. I was a 
child. I was a weary ancient. I 
was among the Rememberers. I 
visited Somnambulists. I saw the 
Prince of Roum attempt to purchase eyes from an Artificer in 
Dijon. I bargained with the Procurator of Perris. I gripped the 
handles of my instruments and 
entered Watchfulness. I ate sweet 
things from a far-off world; I 
drew into my nostrils the perfume of springtime on Palash; I 
shivered in an old man’s private 
winter; I swam in a surging sea, 
buoyant and happy; I sang; I 
wept; I resisted temptations; I 
yielded to temptations; I quarreled with Olmayne; I embraced 
Avluela; I experienced a flickering succession of nights and days 
as my biological clock moved in 
strange rhythms of reversal and 
acceleration. Illusions beset me. 
It rained fire from the sky; time 
rushed in several directions; I 
grew small and then enormous. I 
heard voices speaking in shades 
of scarlet and turquoise. Jagged 
music sparkled on the mountains. 
The sound of my drumming 
heartbeats was rough and fiery. 
I was trapped between strokes of 
my brain-piston, arms pressed to 
my sides so that I would occupy 
as little space as possible as it 
rammed itself home again and 
again and again. The stars throbbed, contracted, melted. Avluela 
said gently, “We earn a second 
youthtime through the indulgent 
benevolent impulses of the Will 
and not through the performance 
of individual good works.” Qlmayne said, “How sleek I get!” 
Talmit said, “These oscillations 
of perception signify only the dissolution of the wish toward selfdestruction that lies at the heart 
of the ageing process.” Gormon 
said, “These perceptions of oscillation signify only the self-destruction of the wish toward dissolution that lies at the ageing 
process of the heart.” The Procurator Man rule Seven said, “We 
have been sent to this world as 
the devices of your purgation. We 
are instruments of the Will.” 
Earfhdaim Nineteen said, “On 
the ether hand, permit me to disagree. The intersection of Earth’s 
destinies and ours is purely accidental.” My eyelids turned to 
stone. The small creatures comprising my lungs began to flower. 
My skin sloughed off, revealing 
strands of muscle clinging to 
bone. Olmayne said, “My pores 
grow smaller. My flesh grows 
tight. My breasts grow small.” 
Avluela said, “Afterwards you 
will fly with us, Tomis.” The 
Prince of Roum covered his eyes
with his hands. The towers of 
Roum swayed in the winds of the 
sun. I snatched a shawl from a 
passing Rememberer. Clowns 
wept in the streets of Perris. 
Talmit said, “Awaken, now, 
Tomis, come up from it, open 
your eyes.” 
“I am young again,” I said. 
“Your renewal has only begun,” he said. 
T could no longer move. Attend -*• ants seized me and swathed 
me in porous wrappings, and 
placed me on a rolling cart, and 
took me to a second bank, much 
larger, in which dozens of people 
floated, each in a dreamy seclusion from the others. Their naked 
skulls were festooned with electrodes their eyes were covered 
with pink tape; their hands were 
peacefully joined on their chests. 
Into this tank I went, and there 
were no illusions here, only a 
long slumber unbroken by 
dreams. 
This time I awakened to the 
sounds of a rushing tide, and 
found myself passing feet-first 
through a constricted conduit, 
into a sealed tank where I breathed only fluid, and where I remained something more than a 
minute and something less than 
a century, while layers of sin 
were peeled from my soul. It was 
slow, taxing work. The Surgeons 
worked in a distance, their hands 
thrust into gloves that controlled 
the tiny flaying-knives, and they 
cleansed me of evil with flick 
after flick after flick of the little 
blades, cutting out guilt and sorrow, jealously and rage, greed, 
lust and impatience. 
When they were done with 
me, they opened the lid of the 
tank and lifted me out. I was 
unable to stand unaided. They attached instruments to my limbs 
that kneaded and massaged my 
muscles, restoring the tone. I 
walked again. I looked down at 
my bare body, strong and tautfleshed and vigorous. Talmit 
came to me and threw a handful 
of mirror- dust into the air so that 
I could see myself, and as the 
tiny particles cohered I peered 
at my gleaming reflection. 
“No,” I said. “You have the 
face wrong. I didn’t look like 
that. My nose was sharper — the 
lips weren’t so full — the hair not 
such a deep black — ” 
We have worked from the records of the guild Watchers, Tomis.. You are more exactly a replica of your early self than your 
own memory realizes.” 
“Can that be?” 
“If you prefer, we can shape 
you to fit your self-conceptions 
and not reality. But it would be a 
frivolous thing to do, and it would 
take much time.” 
“No,” I said. “It hardly matters.” 
He informed me then that I 
would have to remain in the 
house of renewal a while longer, 
until I was fully adapted to my 
new self. I was given the neutral 
clothes of a guildless one to wear, 
for I was without affiliation now; 
and I might now opt for any 
guild that would admit me once 
I left the house. How long will 
my renewal last?” I asked Talmit as I dressed 1 . He replied, “You 
came here in summer. Now it is 
winter. We do not work swiftly.” 
“And how fares my companion 
Olmayne?” 
“We failed with her.” 
“I don’t understand.” 
“Would you like to see her?” 
Talmit asked. 
“Yes,” I said, thinking that he 
would bring me to Olmayne’s 
room. In stead he conveyed me to 
Olmayne’s tank. I stood on a ramp 
looking down into a sealed container; Talmit indicated a fiber 
telescope, and I peered into its 
staring eye and beheld Olmayne. 
Or rather, what I was asked to 
believe was Olmayne. A naked 
girl-child of about eleven, 
smooth-skinned and breastless, 
lay curled up in the tank, knees 
drawn close to the -flat chest, 
thumb thrust in mouth. At first I 
did not understand. Then the 
child stirred, and I recognized the 
embryonic features of the regal 
Olmayne I had known: the wide 
mouth', the strong chin, the sharp 
strong cheekbones. A dull shock 
of Horror rippled tErougfi me, 
and I said to Talmit, “WEat is 
tHis?” 
ti’^TT'Hen tHe soul is too badly stained, Tomis, we 
must dig deep to cleanse it. Your 
Olmayne was a difficult case. We 
sHould not Have attempted Her; 
But sHe was insistent, and tKere 
were some indications tKat we 
migHt succeed witH her. THose 
indications were in error, as you 
can see.” 
“But what Happened to Her?” 
“THe renewal entered the irreversible stage before we could 
achieve a purging of her poisons,” 
Talmit said. 
“You went too far? You made 
her too young?” 
“As you can see. Yes.” 
“What will you do? Why don’t 
you get out of there and let her 
grow up again?” 
“You should listen more carefully, Tomis. I said the renewal 
is irreversible.” 
‘ ‘Irreversible?’ ’ 
“SHe is lost in childhood’s 
dreams. Each day she grows years 
younger. The inner clock whirls 
uncontrollably. Her body shrinks; 
her brain grows smooth. She enters babyhood shortly. She will 
never awaken.” 
“And at the end — ” I looked 
away. “What then? A sperm and 
an egg, separating in the tank?”
“The retrogression will not go 
that far. She will die in infancy. 
Many are lost this way.” 
“She spoke of the risks of renewal,” I said. 
“Yet she insisted on our taking 
Her. Her soul was dark, Tomis. 
She lived only for Herself. She 
came to Jorslem to be cleansed, 
and now she has been cleansed, 
and she is at peace with the Will. 
Did you love Her?” 
“Never. Not for an instant.” 
“Then what Have you lost?” 
“A segment of my past, perhaps.” I put my eye to tHe telescope again and beheld Olmayne, 
innocent now, sexless, cleansed. 
At peace with the Will. I searched her oddly altered yet familiar 
face for insight into Her dreams. 
Had she known wKat was befalling her, as she tumbled Helplessly 
into youthfulness? Had she cried 
out in anguish and frustration 
when she felt her life slipping 
away? Had there been a final 
flare of the old imperious Olmayne, before she sank into this 
unwanted purity? The child in 
the tank was smiling. THe supple 
little body uncoiled, tEen drew 
more tightly into a Huddled ball. 
Olmayne was at peace witH the 
Will. Suddenly, as th'ougH Talmit had spread another mirror in 
the air, I looked into my own 
new self and saw what Had been 
done for me and knew that I 
had been granted another life 
with the proviso that I make 
something more of it than I had 
of my first one, and I felt humbled, and pledged myself to serve 
the Will, and I was engulfed in 
joy that came in mighty waves, 
like the surging tides of Earth 
Ocean, and I said farewell to Olmayne and asked Talmit to take 
me to another place. 
XI 
A vluela came to me in my room 
1 in the house of renewal, and 
we both were frightened when we 
met. The jacket she wore left her 
bunched-up wings bare; they 
seemed hardly under her control at all, but fluttered nervously, starting to open a short way, 
their gossamer tips expanding in 
little ^quivering flickers. Her eyes 
were large and solemn; her faee 
looked more lean and pointed 
than ever. We stared in silence at 
one another a long while. 
“Tomis?” she said finally, and 
I nodded. 
She touched my shoulders, my 
arms, my lips. We were strangers. 
That withered old Watcher she 
had known and perhaps loved 
was gone, banished for the next 
fifty years or more, and in his 
place stood someone mysteriously 
transformed, unknown, unmet. 
The old Watcher had been a sort 
of father to her; what was this 
guildless young Tomis supposed
to be? And what was she to me, 
a daughter no longer? 
“Your eyes are the same,” she 
said. “I would always know you 
by the eyes.” 
“What have you done these 
many months, A vluela?” 
“I have been flying every 
night. I flew to Agupt and deep 
into Afreek. When it gets dark I 
go aloft. Do you know, Tomis, 
I feel truly alive only when I’m 
up there?” 
“You are of the Fliers. It is in 
the nature of your guild to feel 
that way.” 
“One day we’ll fly side by side, 
Tomis.” 
I laughed at that. “The old 
Surgeries are closed, Avluela. 
They work wonders here, but they 
can’t transform me into a Flier. 
One must be born with wings.” 
“One doesn’t need wings to 
fly,” she said. 
“I know. The invaders lift 
themselves without the help of 
wings. I saw you, one day soon 
after Roum had fallen, you and 
Gormon in the sky together — ” 
I shook my head. “But I am no 
invader either.” 
“You will fly with me, Tomis. 
We’ll go aloft, and not only by 
night, even though my wings are 
merely nightwings. In bright sunlight we’ll soar together.” 
Her ' fantasy pleased me. I 
gathered her into my arms, and 
she was cool and fragile against 
ime, and for a while we talked 
no more of flying. Later we walked through the corridors, passing 
others who were newly renewed, 
and we went into the great central room whose ceiling admitted 
the winter sunlight, and studied 
each other by that changing pale 
light, and walked and talked. 
She came to me each day at 
my exercise time, and I went 
through the building with her, 
no longer leaning on her arm. In 
my room we embraced, and she 
was cool and slim against me, 
and in her ecstasy her wings unfolded until I was wrapped in 
their silken softness. 
Hpalmit was with me frequently 
too. He showed me the arts 
of using my renewed body, and 
helped me successfully grow 
young. One day he told me that 
Olmayne’s retrogression had come 
to its end. I felt no sorrow over 
that, just a curious emptiness. 
“You will leave here soon,” the 
Renewer said. “Are you ready?” 
“I think so.” 
“Have you given much thought 
to your destination after this 
house?” 
I must seek a new guild, I 
know.” 
“Many guilds would have you, 
Tomis. But which do you want?” 
“The guild in which I would 
be most useful to mankind,” I 
said. I owe the Will a life.”
Talmit said, “Has the flier girl 
spoken to you of the possibilities 
before you?” 
She mentioned a newly founded guild.” 
“Did she give it a name?” 
“The guild of the Redeemers.” 
“What do you know of it?” 
“Very little,” I said. 
“I am of the guild of the Redeemers,” Talmit said. So is the 
Flier. Avluela.” 
“You both are already guilded! How can you belong to more 
than one guild?” 
“Tomis, the guild of Redeemers accepts members from all 
other guilds. It is the supreme 
guild, as the guild of Dommators 
once was. In its ranks are Rememberers and Scribes, Indexers, Servitors, Fliers, Landholders, Somnambulists, Surgeons, 
Clowns, Merchants, and Vendors. There are Changelings too — ” 
“They are outside all guilds 
by law — ” 
“This is the guild of Redeemers. Even Changelings may win 
redemption, Tomis.” 
Chastened, I said, “Even 
Changelings, yes. But how 
strange it is to think of such a 
guild!” 
“Would you despise a guild 
that embraces Changelings?” 
“I find this guild difficult to 
comprehend.” 
“Understanding will come at 
the proper time,” 
“When is the proper time?” 
“The day you leave this place,” 
said Talmit. 
nphat day shortly arrived. AvA luela came to fetch me. I 
stepped forth uncertainly into 
Jorslem’s springtime to complete 
the ritual of renewal. She took 
me through the city to the holy 
places, so that I could worship 
at each of the shrines. I knelt 
at the wall of the Hebers and at 
the gilded dome of the Mislams; 
then I went down into the lower 
part of the city, through the marketplace, to the gray dark illfashioned building covering the 
place where the god of the Christers is said to have died; then I 
went to the spring of knowledge 
and the fountain of the Will, and 
from there to the guildhouse of 
the guild of Pilgrims to surrender 
my mask and robes and starstone, 
and thence to the wall of the Old 
City. At each of these places I 
offered myself to the Will with 
words I had waited long to 
speak. Pilgrims and ordinary citizens of Jorslem gathered at a respectful distance, knowing that 
I had been lately renewed and 
hoping that some emanation from 
my newly youthful body would 
bring them good fortune. At last 
my obligations were fulfilled. I 
was a free man in full health, able 
now to choose the quality of the 
life I wished to lead. 
Avluela said, “Will you come 
with me to the Redeemers now? 
A meeting will convene in an 
hour’s time.” 
From her tunic she drew something small and gleaming, which 
I recognized in bewilderment as 
a starstone. “What are you doing 
with that?” I asked. “Only Pilgrims — ” 
“Put your hand over mine,” 
she said, extending a fist in which 
the starstone was clenched. 
I obeyed. Her small pinched 
face grew rigid. 
“Avluela, what — ?” 
“A signal to the guild,” she said 
gently. “A notice to them to gather now that you are on your way.” 
“How did you get that stone?” 
“Come with me,” she said. “Oh, 
Tomis, if only we could fly there! 
But it is not far. We meet almost 
in the shadow of the house of renewal. Come, Tomis. Come! 
XII 
Hphere was no light in the room. 
Avluela led me into the subterranean blackness and told me 
that I had reached the guildhall 
of the Redeemers and left me 
standing by myself. “Don’t 
move,” she cautioned. 
» I sensed the presence of others 
in the ' room about me. But I 
heard nothing and saw nothing. 
Something was thrust toward 
me. 
Avluela said, “Put out your 
Hands- WKat do you feel?” 
I toucKed a small square cabinet, resting perhaps on a metal 
framework. Along its face were 
familiar dials and levers. My 
groping Hands found Handles rising from tHe cabinet’s upper surface. At once it was as thougH all 
my renewal Had been undone and 
tHe conquest of EartH cancelled 
as well: I was a WatcHer again, 
for surely this was a Watcher’s 
equipment! 
I said, “Is it not tHe same cabinet I once had. But it is not 
greatly different.” 
“Have you forgotten your 
skills, Tomis?” 
“I think they remain witK me 
even now.” 
“Use tHe machine, then,” said 
Avluela. “Do your WatcEing 
once more, and tell me what you 
see.” 
Easily and Happily I slipped into the old attitudes. I performed 
the preliminary rituals quickly, 
clearing my mind of doubts and 
frictions. It was surprisingly simple to bring myself into a spirit 
of Watchfulness thougH I Had not 
attempted it since the night EartH 
fell. 
Now I grasped the Handles. 
They did not terminate in the 
grips to which I was accustomed: 
rather, something cool and Hard 
was mounted at the tip of eacH 
handle. My Hands closed over
the twin coolnesses. I felt a moment of fear. Then I regained the 
necessary tranquility, and my 
soul flooded into the device before me, and I began to WatcH. 
In my Watchfulness I did not 
soar to tfie stars, as I Had in the 
old days. My perception was limited to the immediate surroundings of my room. Eyes closed, 
body Hunched in trance, I readied 
out and came first to Avluela, 
near me, almost upon me. I saw 
Her plainly. She smiled; she nodded; her eyes were aglow. 
— I love you. 
— Yes, Tomis. And we will 
be together always. 
— I Have never felt so close to 
another person. 
— In this guild we are all 
close, all the time. We are the 
Redeemers, Tomis. We are new. 
Nothing like this Has been on 
EartH before. 
— How am I speaking to you, 
Avluela? 
— Your mind speaks to mine, 
tHrougK tHe machine. And some 
day tlie macHine will not be needed. 
nplie starstones grew warm in 
my Hands. I clearly perceived 
tHe instrument, now: a Watcher’s 
cabinet, but with’ certain modifications, among them the starstones mounted on the Handles. 
And I looked beyond Avluela 
and saw other faces, ones that I 
knew. The austere figure of the 
Renewer Talmit was to my left. 
Beside him stood the Surgeon 
with whom I had journeyed to 
Jorslem, with the Changeling 
Bernalt at his elbow; and now I 
knew what business it was that 
brought these men of Nayrub to 
the holy city. The others I did 
not recognize ; but I saw them all, 
by an inner light for the room was 
as dark as it had been when I entered it. Not only did I see them 
but I touched them, mind to 
mind. 
The mind I touched first was 
Bernalt’s. I met it easily though 
fearfully, drew back, met it again. 
I tried to enter Bernalt’s mind, 
but I was afraid. How could I 
hide those prejudices, those petty 
contempts, those conditioned reflexes with which we unavoidably think of Changelings? 
“Hide nothing,” he counseled. 
“Those things are no secret to 
me. Give them up now and join 
me.” 
I struggled. I cast out demons. 
I summoned up the memory of 
the moment outside the Changeling shrine, after Bernalt had 
saved me, when I had invited him 
to journey with us. How had I 
felt then toward him? 
I amplified that moment of 
gratitude and companionship. I • 
let it swell and blaze, and it obliterated the encrustations of 
scorn and empty disdain, and I 
saw the human soul beneath the 
strange Changeling surface, and 
broke through that surface. He 
drew me toward his mind. I 
joined Bernalt, and he enrolled 
me in his guild. I was of the Redeemers now. 
Through my mind rolled a 
voice, and I did not know whether I heard the resonant boom of 
Talmit, or the dry ironic tone of 
the Surgeon, • or Bernalt’s controlled murmur, or Avluela’s soft 
whisper, for it was all these voices 
at once, and others, and they 
said: 
“When all mankind is enrolled 
in our guild, we will be conquered 
no longer. When each of us is 
part of every other one of us, 
our sufferings will end. There is 
no need for us to struggle against 
our conquerors, for we will absorb them, once we are all Redeemed. Enter us, Tomis who 
was the Watcher Wuellig.” 
And I entered. 
T became the Surgeon and the 
Flier and the Renewer and 
the Changeling and the Servitor 
and the rest. And they became 
me. And so long as my hands 
gripped the starstones we were 
one soul and one mind. It was 
the keen perception one gets from 
Watching coupled with the submergence in a larger entity that 
one gets from communion, and I 
knew this was something wholly 
new on Earth, not merely the 
founding of a new guild but the 
initiation of a new cycle of human 
existence, the birth of the Fourth 
Cycle upon this defeated planet. 
The voice said, “Tomis, we will 
Redeem those in greatest need 
first. We will go into Agupt, into 
the desert where miserable 
Changelings huddle in an ancient 
building that they worship, and 
we will take them into us and 
make them clean again. And we 
will go on beyond Agupt, to all 
the lands of the world, and find 
those who are without guilds, 
and those who are without hope, 
and those who are without tomorrows, and we will give them 
life and purpose again. And a 
time will come when all Earth 
is Redeemed.” 
They put a vision before me 
of a transformed planet, and of 
the harsh-faced invaders yielding 
peacefully to us, begging to be 
incorporated into that new thing 
that had germinated in the midst 
of their conquest. They showed 
me an Earth that had been purged of its ancient sins. 
Then I felt it was time to withdraw my hands-from the machine 
I grasped, and I withdrew my 
hands. 
The vision ebbed. The glow 
faded. But yet I was no longer 
alone in my skull, for some contact lingered, and the room had 
ceased to be dark. 
“How did this happen?” I 
asked. “When did this begin?” 
“In the days after the conquest,” said Talmit, “we asked 
ourselves why we had fallen so 
easily, and how we could lift 
ourselves above what we Had 
been. We saw that our guilds had 
not provided enough of a structure for our lives that some closer union was our way to redemption. We had the starstones; we 
had the instruments of Watching; 
all that remained was to fuse 
them.” 
The Surgeon said, “You will 
be important to us, Tomis, because you understand how to 
throw your mind forth. We seek 
former Watchers. They are the 
nucleus of our guild. Once your 
soul roved the stars to search 
out mankind’s enemies; now it 
will roam the Earth to bring mankind together.” 
Avluela said, “You will help 
me to fly, Tomis, even by day 
And you will fly beside me.” 
“When do you leave?” I asked. 
“Now,” she said. “I go to 
Agupt, to the temple of the 
Changelings, to offer them what 
we have. And all of us will join to 
give me strength, and that 
strength will be focused through 
you, Tomis.” Her hands touched 
mine. Her lips brushed mine. 
“The life of Earth begins again, 
now this year, this new cycle. Oh’, 
Tomis, we are all reborn!”
XIII 
\ 
1 remained alone in the room. 
The others scattered. Avluela 
went above, into the street. I 
put my hands to the mounted 
Starstones and I saw her as clearly as though she stood beside me. 
She was preparing herself for 
flight. First she put off her clothing, and her bare form glistened 
in the afternoon sun. Her body 
seemed impossibly delicate; a 
strong wind would scatter her, I 
thought. Then she knelt, bowed, 
made her ritual. She spoke to 
herself, yet I heard her words, 
the secret words Fliers say as 
they ready themselves to leave 
the ground. 
She rose and let her wings unfold. Some passersby looked oddly at her, not because there was 
anything unusual about the sight 
of a naked Flier in the streets of 
Jorslem, but because the sunlight was so strong and her transparent wings, so lightly stained 
with' pigment, were evidently 
nightwings incapable of withstanding the pressure of the solar 
wind. 
“Now we fly to Agupt,” she 
murmured, “to Redeem the 
Changelings and make them one 
of us. Tomis, will you come with 
me?” 
“I will be with you,” we said, 
and I gripped the starstones 
tightly and crouched over my 
cabinet of instruments in the dark 
room beneath the place where she 
stood. “We will fly together, Avluela.” 
“Up then,” she said, and we 
said, “Up.” 
Her wings beat, curving to take 
the wind, and we felt her struggling in the first moment, and we 
gave her the strength she needed; 
she took it as it poured from ug 
through me to her, and we rose 
high. The spires and parapets of 
Jorslem the golden grew small, 
and the city became a pink dot in 
the green hills. Avluela’s throbbing wings thrust her swiftly 
westward, toward the setting sun, 
toward the land of Agupt. Her ecstasy swept through us all. “See, 
Tomis, how wonderful it is, far 
above everything? The cool wind 
against your bare flesh — the 
breeze in your hair — you drift 
on the currents, you coast, you 
soar — ” 
To Agupt. To the sunset. 
W e looked down at the sparkling Lake Medit. From 
this height one could not tell 
that our world had even been 
conquered. One saw only the 
beauty of the colors of the land 
and the sea, not the checkpoints 
.of the invaders. 
Those checkpoints would not 
long endure. We would conquer 
our conquerors, not with weapons but with love, and as the

Listen , Men! We are deceiving you 
- but don't risk I earning the truth ! 
'T'he office building had been a 
-®~ hotel, once, and a famous 
married architect had shot a society physician in the grand foyer 
at that time. Now there was a 
horse-wire service doing business 
as a Bell substation down one of 
the twisting, door-lined Corridors. 
The men who operated the cage 
elevators wore yellowed white 
shirts, no ties, and the pants from 
pin-striped suits. Everything was 
either wooden and painted olive 
green or clad in linoleum and 
worn down to grit. Lunchtimes, a 
sallow man sold bready hamburgers cooked in salad oil on 
an iron sheet in an alcove beside 
the main entrance. Every five 
minutes, all day, subway trains 
ran under the foundations. 
Walter Keneally sat in an office with a numbered door and 
pine shelves on the walls of the 
one room. There were newspapers, 
books, magazines and many ledgers on the shelves. He spoke all 
day to Karachi, Alexandria, 
Reykjavik, Wellington, Seoul, 
Lhassa, Colombo and other cities, 
through the worn sand-colored 
telephone in his golden oak rolltop desk, or by other means. Every morning, too, there was a drift 
of mail on the floor below the 
slot in the door, and whenever he 
was not talking or listening to 
faraway voices, Walter Keneally, who looked like a smoothskinned bear with a balded white 
crewcut, would be hunched over 
an Oliver side-arm typewriter 
with its black iron frame coated 
in gummy oil and grime. His 
short,' calloused hands, hard as 
blackjacks, would stab their sau
sage fingers at the yellowed ivory 
key-tops, and further information 
and instructions would flow from 
him onto dimestore airmail stationery, into envelopes half-covered with stamps, thence into 
the mailbox on the corner that 
night, and thus to the four corners of the world. 
He was there at eight-thirty 
each morning, and he left at seven 
each night. Once a week he went 
out to the post office at noon and 
bought two hundred dollars in 
stamps. Once a month he stopped at the Bargain Store for stationery. At night, he went to a 
room on Twelfth Street, where for 
thirty dollars a month he had an 
iron bed, a plywood closet one 
foot deep with two black hangers 
hooked over a length of piano 
wire, and a bureau with the bottom missing from its top drawer. 
At home and in his office, he 
would often pause in the middle 
of communicating and sigh. 
He looked up from his typewriter now, at the shut door of 
his office, and pulled his eyelids 
until he was pinching the bridge 
of his nose. He sighed. At the 
same time, his door opened, a 
man stepped in carrying a furled 
umbrella in his left hand, and 
the man said sharply : “Keneally!” 
Keneally had never seen him 
before, but the sudden voice turned him in his swiveling typist’s 
NOW HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD 
chair. The stranger arced a long 
steel skewer like a rapier blade 
out of the umbrella, came in with 
quick steps and, with a practiced 
overhand motion and all his momentum, thrust the skewer 
through Keneally and anchored 
him to the golden oak desk. 
There was a faint chuff! from 
Keneally. “Got you!” the thin, 
sharp-faced man said, his eyes 
glittering and his head cocked 
intently to one side as he watched Keneally’s face. 
Ty'' eneally looked down. The 
handle of the skewer was a 
length of adhesive tape wound 
around the home-ground steel; 
the white tape was grimy and 
frayed at the edges, as if it had 
been carried from place to place 
a long time and often toyed with. 
“Got me,” he admitted in his 
slow, old bear’s voice. 
“I will not waste time. I will 
not give you an opportunity to 
receive any help from your international confederates,” the 
thin man said, pursing his lips. 
“I am Amos Qnsott of the One 
World Language League. My offices are also on this floor. My 
organization has hundreds of 
members throughout the world, 
and I am here to inform you we 
are destroying your conspiracy 
today.” 
Keneally tested the skewer’s 
ability to keep him sprawled un
61 
comfortably in the chair. There 
was a faint grating noise from his 
chest as he moved, and he settled back. “How long have you 
been on to us?” 
“We have done considerable 
research. Beginning from the time 
I first noticed your activities and 
communicated my suspicions to 
certain League members who 
corroborated my deductions. Volunteers from our organization 
have investigated the activities of 
your underlings in many locations. We have verified that neither you nor your correspondents 
eat, sleep, or betray any other 
signs of human behavior.” 
“There is no time,” Keneally 
said. “We have too much to do. 
Even at night, when we change 
shifts and make our reports.” 
He wagged his head, looking from 
one side of the office to the other. “We do not require rest or 
pleasure.” 
Onsott now opened his suit coat 
and pulled a long, serrated-edge 
breadknife out of his trousers. 
“We will not get you all, but we 
will hand your organization a 
defeat that will give your survivors long second thoughts about 
meddling with the human race. 
We are not prepared to temporize, 
or compromise, or waste time attempting to convince official authority. Your bloodless parts will 
be our defense against charges 
of murder. A fair, untroubled 
62 
world will be our evidence for 
your erstwhile plotting!” He came 
forward, lips pursed, eyes glittering. 
“What have we done?” Keneally asked, sighing. “What about 
us has aroused your . humanity?” 
“You are a robot under the 
control of intelligences in outer 
space, with whom you communicate telepathically You confirm 
our deductions? And you are the 
chief of an international organization of robots which has been 
consistently influencing human 
affairs. Disguised as humans, you 
have infiltrated every major scientific establishment our members have been able to inspect 
since my warning. You have influenced legislation and appropriations on a worldwide scale. You 
are in fact the managers of national policy in every noteworthy nation; we do not have your 
resources, my friend, but we are 
willing and, for amateurs, quite 
efficient — as you can see. What 
have you done?” Onsott was furious. “The world is inexorably approaching the ultimate war! How 
many years have you shaped our 
destiny! How many bombs and 
biological poisons have you 
brewed up! What have you 
done/” 
He jumped to Keneally’s side, 
seized his wrist, and pulled his 
arm out straight. The chair slew
GALAXY 
ed wildly on its stiff casters and 
Half-broken wheels, and the 
skewer bent in Keneally’s chest 
but did not pull free. He raised 
Jus other arm and tried to reach 
across to help his imprisoned 
wrist, but could not make it. The 
thin, pale, indignant man had the 
leverage, and now, by trapping 
the arm against his side with one 
hand, was able to begin attacking Keneally’s shoulder with the 
knife. 
Keneally let his other arm fall 
and turned his head to watch 
the white, rumpled broadcloth 
being sawed into a frayed wound, 
and then the tee shirt’s soft cotton 
trying to snag the knife’s teeth. 
As the knife reached Keneally, 
it made a sound like something 
dividing a package of frozen spinach. 
C4 lA7’ 0rld ^ ar began August 12, 1958, and was 
over by mid-September,” Keneally said. “Every major city and 
human installation on Earth was 
destroyed. A few weeks later, the 
last living thing on this planet 
succumbed to the incidental radioactivity. We are not controlled 
from outer space. We do not need 
to communicate with our makers 
at all. That’s fortunate, because 
they can only perceive dimly 
from where they are. We are 
made by the future; by the human beings of the future who 
NOW HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD 
must somehow restore life to this 
world, and continuity to this 
world’s history, or die because 
there is no human race in the 
future. Do you understand?” 
Qnsott’s eyes stared into Keneally’s, but the knife sawed 
back and forth remorselessly. 
“The people of the future can 
manipulate time,” Keneally said. 
“The transit of time is more difficult to understand than motorcar or interplanetary space. But 
if the human race lives long 
enough, then some day time has 
to be understood and devices 
built for acting through it. Not 
time ships, perhaps, but at least 
time grapples or time tools. Is 
that really so difficult to believe?” 
Out beyond the grime-grayed 
window, a pigeon took flight from 
the spattered windowsill and, 
bluish-gray, flailed up into a sky 
of indeterminate color. Qnsott’s 
elbow jerked back and forth. His 
sleeve twitched the skirt of his 
jacket. His mouth was shut tight. 
His eyes hardly blinked. 
Keneally said: “The humans 
who made me with their remote 
devices can’t themselves enter 
their own past. They can’t make 
changes in their own history. If 
they change the past they change 
themselves and can’t be the people of the future world they believe in. We are not making war. 
People make war; we are trying 
to cancel it. It’s not easy. Tile 
war was a complex event.” 
“I won’t listen,” Onsott said, 
the cords of his wrist white and 
taut as he bore down on the knife. 
“Your life isn’t even self-consistent.” 
It was time for another subway 
train to go by underfoot. Keneally watched Onsott tremble slightly until it was time for the building’s sway to have died out. 
Keneally said: “They saw the 
war break out, and they knew 
what it meant. They are at their 
machines now, day and night peering to see if we are carrying out 
their plans. As long as we can 
act and they can see us, their 
time will not wink out; they will 
have succeeded, and their world 
will be green, and living. But if 
we should cease working, if even 
for an instant there were not 
some one of us working to restore this break in humanity’s 
lifeline, then it would be true 
forever that Earth died in midSeptember of 1958 and the human race died with it. Can I 
persuade you to stop? Can I persuade you to get in touch with 
your organization’s members?” 
But at this point, Onsott stepped back and released his hold. 
Keneally’s left arm fell to the 
floor and shattered, still in its 
sleeve. Onsott hurled himself 
around to Keneally’s other shoulder. Keneally turned his head. 
£ i jT\nsott, there is nothing alive 
in this world except a few 
protein molecules being teased into organization and life in our 
laboratories; protein molecules 
that have been created to resist 
the great miasma of radiation 
that bathes this planet; bathes 
me, bathes you.” 
Onsott’s forehead was glistening with' perspiration. He snatched the knife away from Keneally’s shoulder for an instant, bit 
hard at the knuckles, stared at 
the red-dimpled whiteness he 
had inflicted on the flesh he saw 
there, glared scornfully at Keneally, and resumed his work. 
“When I have you in a little 
heap of parts,” he snarled, “will 
you still be talking?” 
“Onsott, if there is going to be 
history, it must be human history. There must be lovers, and 
new model cars, and airline disasters; new syndicated comic 
strips, elections, and births of 
quintuplets. Don’t you see that? 
These things must be part of the 
unbroken human heritage, even 
if there were no humans. There 
must be three billion human histories being played out on this 
world, and played without a hint 
of self-consciousness. Even if 
there are no protoplasmic humans 
to play them, and will not be 
until there has been much more 
success in the laboratories. 
“Onsott, you want to live, don’t 
GALAXY 
you? You want to go on believing in this world? Feel pain, and 
joy, and hope for a day when everyone speaks your language? 
What moves you, Onsott? What 
do you prize above all other 
things? Do you want to keep it? 
Keep the chance of attaining 
it? You must stop this. 
“Onsott, the radiation level will 
not permit life. The surface of 
this world is sterile; the deepest 
canyons and oceans are bare of 
life and are tumbled with heaps 
of calcium. There is no grass, 
there is no cool wind. There is 
sometimes rain and mud, and 
there is always death. Do you understand? The living world exists 
only in the minds of the subautomatons who now inhabit it for 
us in the firm conviction that 
what they see and do has some 
external reality, that the history 
they record and make leads naturally from the past and firmly 
into the future.” Keneally looked 
around the office again. “They 
keep the dream, God bless them. 
God bless you. But others don’t 
require pleasure and beauty. Others must be self-aware when the 
radiation-resistant humans finally emerge from our researches, 
and the reborn human race has 
been worked into the weave of 
history again.” Keneally said, 
watching Onsott working palemouthed and intent: “We others 
mustn’t dream; we must rebuild 
NOW HEAR THE WORD OF THE LORD 
the grass and cities good as old 
again. We can’t permit you to 
stop us.” He looked closely at 
Onsott. “We would like to be con* 
siderate. But we can’t ally ourselves with death.” 
Onsott stopped and listened to 
something, head to one side. A 
bus perhaps, turning the corner 
of Broadway on the street below; 
it was time for one. The familiar 
sound of shifting gears and labor* 
ing acceleration would be quite 
noticeable, even so far down this 
hallway. Onsott returned to his 
work. 
Keneally shook his head and 
sighed. He went on talking, but 
there was now no particular attempt to make Onsott pay attention. “We have the factories and 
labs going again. We have the 
minimal communications. We 
have some of the key cities restored sufficiently to operate as 
centers of civilization. But we 
are far from done. If you leave 
me alone now, Onsott, you will 
enjoy the remainder of a long 
life, and the sense of age, and 
the answer to the question of 
what dying is like. Do you want 
that? Most humanistic individuals do. And I can promise it to 
you, because we are all still a 
long, sorry way away' from the 
time when the human past is 
smoothly restored' and we wink 
out like snuffed candles. You understand? The future can wait on

The War 
With The Fnools 
by PHILIP K. DICK 
Illustrated by JONES 
The Fnools were determined to 
invade Earth no matter how 
idiotic they looked doing it! 
/Captain Edgar Lightfoot of CIA 
^ said, “Dam it, the Fnools 
are back again, Major. They’ve 
taken over Provo, Utah.” 
With a groan, Major Hauk signaled his secretary to bring him 
the Fnool dossier from the locked 
archives. “What form are they 
assuming this time?” he asked 
briskly. 
“Tiny real-estate salesmen,” 
Lightfoot said. 
Last time, Major Hauk reflected, it had been filling station attendants. That was the 
thing about the Fnools. When 
one took a particular shape they 
all took that shape. Of course, 
it made detection for CIA fieldmen much easier. But it did make 
the Fnools look absurd, and 
Hauk did not enjoy fighting an 
absurd enemy; it was a quality 
which tended to diffuse over both 
sides and even up to his own 
office. 
“Do you think they’d come to 
terms?” Hauk said, half-rhetorically. “We could afford to sacrifice Provo, Utah, if they’d be 
willing to circumscribe themselves there. We could even add 
those portions of Salt Lake City 
which are paved with hideous 
old red brick.” 
Lightfoot said, “Fnools never 
compromise, Major. Their goal 
is Sol System domination. For 
all time.” 
Leaning over Major Hauk’s 
shoulder. Miss Smith said “Here 
is the Fnool dossier, sir.” With 
her free hand she pressed the top 
of her blouse against her in a 
gesture indicating either advanced tuberculosis or advanced 
modesty. There were certain indications that it was the latter. 
“Miss Smith,” Major Hauk 
complained, “here are the Fnools 
trying to take over the Sol System and I’m handed their dossier by a woman with a forty-two 
inch bosom. Isn’t that a trifle 
schizophrenic — for me, at 
least?” Fie carefully averted his 
eyes from her, remembering his 
wife and the two children. “Wear 
something else from here on out,” 
he told her; “Or swaddle yourself. 
I mean, my God, let’s be reasonable; let’s be realistic.” 
“Yes, Major,” Miss Smith said. 
“But remember, I was selected 
at random from the CIA employees pool. I didn’t ask to be 
your secretary.” 
With Captain Lightfoot beside 
him, Major Hauk laid out the 
documents that made up the 
Fnool dossier. 
In the Smithsonian there was 
a huge Fnool, standing three feet 
high, stuffed and preserved in a 
natural habitat-type cubicle. 
School children for years had 
marveled at this Fnool, which 
was shown with pistol aimed at 
Terran innocents. By pressing a 
button, the school children caused 
the Terrans (not stuffed but imitation) to flee, whereupon the 
Fnool extinguished them with its 
advanced solar-powered weapon 
. and the exhibit reverted to its 
original stately scene, ready to 
begin all over again. 
Major Hauk had seen the exhibit, and it made him uneasy. 
The Fnools, he had declared time 
and time again, were no joke. But 
there was something about a 
Fnool that — well, a Fnool was 
an idiotic life form. That was 
the basis of it. No matter what 
it imitated it retained its midget 
aspect; a Fnool looked like something given away free at supermarket openings, along with balloons and moist purple orchids. 
No doubt, Major Hauk had ruminated, it was a survival factor. 
It disarmed the Fnool’s opponents. Even the name. It was just 
not possible to take them seriously, even at this very moment 
when they were infesting Provo, 
Utah, in the form of miniature 
real-estate salesmen. 
Hauk instructed, “Capture a 
Fnool in this current guise, Lightfoot, bring it to me and I’ll par
GALAXY 
ley. I feel like capitulating, this 
time. I’ve been fighting them for 
twenty years now. I’m worn out.” 
“If you get one face to face 
with you,” Lightfoot cautioned, 
“it may successfully imitate you 
and that would be the end. We 
would have to incinerate both of 
you, just to be on the safe side.” 
Gloomily, Hauk said, “I’ll set 
up a key password situation with 
you right now, Captain. The word 
is masticate. I’ll use it in a sentence . for instance, ‘I’ve got 
to thoroughly masticate these 
data.’ The Fnool won’t know that 
— correct?” 
“Yes, Major,” Captain Lightfoot sighed and left the CIA office at once, hurrying to the ’copter field across the street to begin 
his trip to Provo, Utah. 
But he had a feeling of foreboding. 
\A7"h en kis ’copter landed at the 
’ ‘ end of Provo Canyon on 
the outskirts of the town, he was 
at once approached by a twofoot-high man in a gray business 
suit carrying a briefcase. 
“Good morning, sir,” the Fnool 
piped. “Care to look at some 
choice lots, all with unobstructed 
views? Can be subdivided into — ” 
“Get in the ’copter,” Lightfoot 
said, aiming his Army-issue .45 
at the Fnool. 
“Listen, my friend,” the Fnool 
said, in a jolly tone of voice. “I
can see you”ve never really given 
any hard-headed thought to the 
meaning of our race having landed on your planet. Why don’t 
we step into the office a moment 
and sit down?” The Fnool indicated a nearby small building in 
which Lightfoot saw a desk and 
chairs. Over the office there was 
a sign: 
EARLY BIRD 
LAND DEVELOPMENT 
INCORPORATED 
“ ‘The early bird catches the 
worn,’ ” the Fnool declared. 
“And the spoils go to the winner, 
Captain Lightfoot. By nature’s 
laws, if we manage to infest your 
planet and pre-empt you, we’ve 
got all the forces of evolution 
and biology on our side.” The 
Fnool beamed cheerily. 
Lightfoot said, “There’s a CIA 
major back in Washington, D.C. 
who’s on to you.” 
“Major Hauk has defeated us 
twice,” the Fnool admitted. “We 
respect him. But lie’s a voice crying in the wilderness, in this country, at least. You know perfectly 
well, Captain, that the average 
American viewing that exhibit at 
the Smithsonian merely smiles 
in a tolerant fashion. There’s just 
no awareness of the menace.” 
By now two other Fnools, also 
in the form of tiny real-estate 
salesmen in gray business suits 
carrying briefcases, had approached. “Look,” one said to the 
other. “Charley’s captured a terran.” 
“No,” its companion disagreed, 
“the Terran captured him.” 
All three of you get in the CIA 
’copter,” Lightfoot ordered, waving his .45 at them. 
“You’re making a mistake,” 
the first Fnool said, shaking its 
head. “But you’re a young man; 
you’ll mature in time.” It walked to the ’copter. Then, all at 
once, it spun and cried, “Death 
to the Terr arts!” 
Its briefcase whipped up, a bolt 
of pure solar energy whined past 
Lightfoot’s right ear. Lightfoot 
dropped to one knee and squeezed 
the trigger of the .45; the Fnool, 
in the doorway of the ’copter, 
pitched head-forward and lay 
with its briefcase beside it. The 
other two Fnools watched as 
Lightfoot cautiously kicked the 
briefcase away. 
“Young,” one of the remaining 
Fnools said, “but with' quick reflexes. Did you see the way he 
dropped on one knee?” 
Terrans are no joke,” the other agreed. “We’ve got an uphill 
battle ahead of us.” 
“As long as you’re here,” the 
first of the remaining Fnools said 
to Lightfoot, “why don’t you put^ 
a small deposit down on some 
valuable unimproved land we’ve 
got a listing for? I’ll be glad to 
70 
run you out to have a look at 
it. Water and electricity available 
at a slight additional cost.” 
“Get in the ’copter,” Lightfoot 
repeated, aiming his gun steadily 
at them. 
I n Berlin, an Oberstleutnant of 
the SHD, the Sicherheitsdien$t — the West German Security Service — approaching his 
commanding officer, saluted in 
what is termed Roman style and 
said, “General, die Fnoolen sind 
wieder zutuck. Was sollen wit 
jetz tun?” 
“The Fnools are hack?” Hochflieger said, horrified. “Already? 
But it was only three years ago 
that we uncovered their network 
and eradicated them.” Jumping 
to his feet General Hochflieger 
paced about his cramped temporary office in the basement of 
the Bundesrat Gebaude, his large 
hands clasped behind his back. 
“And what guise this time? Assistant Ministers of Domestic Finance, as before?” 
“No sir,” the Oberstleutnant 
said. “They have come as gear 
inspectors of the VW works. 
Brown suit, clipboard, thick 
glasses, middle-aged. Fussy. And, 
as before, nut six-tenth of a meter 
high.” 
“What I detest about the 
Fnools,” Hochflieger said, “is 
their ruthless use of science in the 
service of destruction, especially 
their medical techniques. They 
almost defeated us with that virus infection suspended in the ^ 
gum on the backs of multi-color ^ 
commerative stamps.” 
“A desperate weapon,” his subordinate agreed, “but rather too fantastic to be successful, ultimately. This time they’ll probably rely on crushing force combined with an absolutely synchronized timetable.” 
“Selbsverstandlich,” Hochflieger agreed. “But we’ve nonetheless got to react and defeat them. 
Inform Terpol.” That was the 
Terra- wide organization of counter-intelligence with headquarters on Luna. Where, specifically, 
have they been detected?” 
“In Schweinfurt only, so far.” 
“Perhaps we should obliterate 
the Schweinfurt area.” 
• “They’ll only turn up elsewhere.” 
“True.” Hochflieger brooded. 
“What we must do is pursue Operation Hundefutter to successful 
culmination.” Hundefutter had 
developed for the West German 
Government a sub-species of Terrans six-tenths of a meter high and 
capable of assuming a variety of 
forms. They would be used to 
penetrate the network of Fnool 
activity and destroy it from within. Hundefutter, financed by the 
Krupp family, had been held in 
readiness for just this moment. 
“I’ll activate Kommando Ein
satzgmppe II,” his subordinate 
said. “As counter-F nools they can 
begin to drop behind Fnool lines 
near the Schweinfurt area immediately. By nightfall the situation 
should be in our hands.” 
“Gruss Gott,” Hochfleiger 
prayed, nodding. “Well, get the 
kommando started, and we’ll 
keep our ears open to see how it 
proceeds.” 
If it failed, he realized, more 
desperate measures would have 
to be initiated. 
The survival of our race is at 
stake, Hochflieger said to himself. 
The next four thousand years of 
history will be determined by 
the brave act of a member of the 
SHD at this hour. Perhaps myself. 
He paced about, meditatiing on 
that. 
In Warsaw the local chief of the 
People’s Protective Agency 
for Preserving the Democratic 
Process — the NNBNDL — read 
the coded teletype dispatch several times as he sat at his desk 
drinking tea and eating a late 
breakfast of sweet rolls and Polish ham. This time disguised as 
chess players, Serge Nicov said 
to himself. And each Fnool making use of the queen’s pawn 
opening, Qp to Q3 ... a weak 
opening, he reflected, especially 
against Kp to K4, even if they 
draw white. But — 
Still a potentially dangerous 
situation. 
On a piece of official stationery he wrote select out 
class of chess players employing queen’s pawn opening. For 
Invigorating Forest-r e n e w a 1 
Team, he decided. Fnools are 
small, but they can plant saplings 
. we must get some use out of 
them. Seeds; they can plant sunflower seeds for our tundra-removal vegetable-oil venture. 
A year of hard physical work, 
he decided, and they’ll think 
twice before they invade Terra 
again. 
On the other hand, we could 
make a deal with them, offer 
them an alternative to invigorating forest-renewal activity. They 
could enter the Army as a special 
brigade and be used in Chile, in 
the rugged mountains. Being only 
sixty-one centimeters high, many 
of them could be packed into a 
single nuclear sub for transport 
. but can Fnools be trusted? 
The thing he hated most about 
Fnools — and he bad learned to 
know them in their previous invasions of Terra was their de
ceitfulness. Last time they had 
taken the physical form of a 
troupe of ethnic dancers . and 
what dancers they had turned 
out to be. They had massacred an 
audience in Leningrad before 
anyone could intervene, men, 
women and children all dead on 
the spot by weapons of ingenious 
design and sturdy although monotonous construction which had 
masqueraded as folk-instruments 
of a five -stringed' variety. 
It could never happen again; 
all Democratic lands were alert, 
now;' special youth groups had 
been set up to keep vigil. But 
something new — such as this 
gjiess-player deception — - could 
succeed as well, especially in 
small towns in the East republics, 
where chess players were enthusiastically welcomed. 
From a hidden compartment in 
his desk Serge Nicov brought out 
the special non-dial phone, picked up the receiver and said into 
the mouthpiece, “Fnools back, in 
North Caucasus area. Better get 
as many tanks as possible lined 
up to accept their advance as they 
attempt to spread out. Contain 
them and then cut directly 
through their center, bisecting 
them repeatedly until they’re 
splintered and can be dealt with 
in small bands.” 
“Yes, Political Officer Nicov.” 
Serrge Nicov hung up and resumed eating his — now cold — 
late breakfast. 
A s Captain Lightfoot piloted 
the ’copter back to Washington, D.C. one of the two captured Fnools said, 
“How is it that no matter what 
guise we come in, you Terrans
can always detect us? We’ve appeared on your planet as filling 
station attendants, Volkswagen 
gear inspectors, chess champions, 
folk singers complete with native instruments, minor government officials, and now real-estate salesmen — ” 
Lightfoot said, “It’s your size.” 
“That concept conveys nothing to us.” 
“You’re only two feet tall!” 
The two Fnools conferred, and 
then the other Fnool patiently 
explained, “But size is relative. 
We have all the absolute qualities of Terrans embodied in our 
temporary forms, and according 
to obvious logic — ” 
“Look,” Lightfoot said, “stand 
Here next to me.-” The Fnool, in 
its gray business suit, carrying 
its briefcase, came cautiously up 
to stand beside him. “You just 
come up to my knee cap,” Lightfoot pointed out. I’m six feet 
high'. You’re only one- third as 
tall as I. In a group of Terrans 
you Fnools stand out like an egg 
in a barrel of kosher pickles.” 
“Is that a folk saying?” the 
Fnool asked. I’d better write that 
down.” From its coat pocket it 
produced a tiny ball point pen 
no longer than a match. “Egg in 
barrel of pickles. Quaint. I hope, 
when we’ve wiped out your civilization, that some of your ethnic 
customs will be preserved by our 
museums.” 
“I hope so, too,” Lightfoot said, 
lighting a cigarette. 
The other Fnool, pondering, 
said, “I wonder if there’s any way 
we can grow taller. Is it a racial 
secret preserved by your people?” 
Noticing the burning cigarette 
dangling between Lightfoot’s lips, 
the Fnool said, “Is that how you 
achieve unnatural height? By 
burning that stick of compressed 
dried vegetable fibers and inhaling the smoke?” 
“Yes,” Lightfoot said, Handing 
the cigarette to the two-foothigh Fnool. “That’s our secret. 
Cigarette-smoking makes you 
grow. We Have all our offspring, 
especially teen-agers, smoke. Everyone that’s young.” 
“I’m going to try it,” the Fnool 
said to its companion. Placing 
the cigarette between its lips, it 
inhaled deeply. 
Lightfoot blinked. Because the 
Fnool was now four feet high, 
and its companion instantly imitated it; both Fnoois were twice 
as high as before. Smoking the 
cigarette had augmented the 
Fnoois’ height incredibly by two 
whole feet. 
“Thank you,” the now four 
foot-high real-estate salesman 
said to Lightfoot, in a much deeper voice than before. “We are 
certainly making bold strides, 
are we not?” 
Nervously, Lightfoot said, ' 
“Gimme back the cigarette.” 
In his office at the CIA building, 
Major Julius Hauk pressed a 
button on his desk, and Miss 
Smith alertly opened the door 
and entered the room, dictation 
pad in hand. 
“Miss Smith,” Major Hauk 
said, “Captain Lightfoot’s away. 
Now I can tell you. The Fnoois 
are going to win this time. As 
senior officer in charge of defeating them, I’m about to give 
up and go down to the bombproof shelter constructed for 
hopeless situations such as this.” 
“I’m sorry to hear that, sir,” 
Miss Smith said, her long eyelashes fluttering. “I’ve enjoyed 
working for you.” 
“But you, too,” Hauk explained. “All Terrans are wiped out; 
our defeat is planet-wide.” Opening a drawer of his desk he 
brought out an unopened fifth of 
Bullock & Lade Scotch which he 
had been given as a birthday 
present. “I’m going to finish this 
B&L Scotch off first,” he informed Miss Smith. “Will you 
join me?” 
“No thank you, sir,” Miss 
Smith said. “I’m afraid I don’t 
drink, at least during the daylight hours. 
Major Hauk drank for a moment from a dixie cup, then tided 
a little more from the bottle just 
to be sure it was Scotch all the 
way to the bottom. At last he 
put it down and said, “It’s hard 
to believe that our backs could 
be put to the wall by creatures 
no larger than domestic orangestriped tomcats, but such is the 
case.” He nodded courteously to 
Miss Smith. “I’m off for the concrete sub-surface bomb-proof 
shelter, where I hope to hold out 
after the general collapse of life 
as we know it.” 
“Good for you, Major Hauk,” 
Miss Smith' said, a little uneasliy. 
“But are you — just going to 
leave me here to become a captive of the Fnools? I mean — ” 
Her sharply pointed breasts 
quivered in becoming unison beneath her blouse. “It seems sort 
of mean.” 
“You have nothing to fear from 
the Fnools, Miss Smith,” Major 
Hauk said. “After all, two feet 
tall — ” He gestured. “Even a 
neurotic young woman could 
scarcely — ” He laughed. “Really.” 
“But it’s a terrible feeling,” 
Miss Smith said, “to be abandoned in the face of what we know 
to be an unnatural enemy from 
another planet entirely.” 
“I tell you what,” Major Hauk 
said thoughtfully. “Perhaps I’ll 
break a series of strict CIA rulings and allow you to go below to 
the shelter with me.” 
Putting down her pad and pencil and hurrying over to him, 
Miss Smith breathed, “Oh, Major, how can I thank you!”
“Just come along,” Major 
Hauk said, leaving the bottle of 
B&L Scotch behind in his haste, 
the situation being what it was. 
Miss Smith clung to him as he 
made his way a trifle unsteadily 
down the corridor to the elevator. 
“Drat that Scotch,” he murmured. “Miss Smith, Vivian, you 
were wise not to touch it. Given 
the cortico-thalamic reaction we 
are all experiencing in the face 
of the Fnoolian peril, Scotch isn’t 
the beneficial balm it generally 
is.” 
“Here,” his secretary said, sliding under his arm to help prop 
him up as they waited for the 
elevator. “Try to stand firm, Major. It won’t be long now.” 
“You have a point there,” Major Hauk agreed. “Vivian, my 
dear.” 
Hphe elevator came at last. It 
was the self-service type. 
“You’re being really very kind 
to me,” Miss Smith said, as the 
major pressed the proper button 
and the elevator began to descend. 
“Well, it may prolong your 
life,” Major Hauk agreed. “Of 
course, that far underground . 
the average temperature is much 
greater than at the Earth’s surface. Like a deep mine shaft, it 
runs in the near-hundreds.” 
“But at least we’ll be alive,” 
Miss Smith pointed out. 
Major Hauk removed his coat 
and tie. ‘‘Be prepared for the 
humid warmth,” he told her. 
“Here, perhaps you would like 
to remove your coat.” 
“Yes,” Miss Smith said, allowing him in his gentlemanly way 
to remove her coat. 
The elevator arrived at the 
shelter. No one was there ahead 
of them, fortunately; they had 
the shelter all to themselves. 
“It is stuffy down here,” Miss 
Smith said as Major Hauk 
switched on one dim yellow light. 
“Oh dear.” She stumbled over 
something in the gloom. “It’s so 
hard to see.” Again she stumbled 
over some object; this time she 
half-fell.“Shouldn’t we have more 
light, Major?” 
“What, and attract the Fnools?” 
In the dark, Major Hauk felt 
about until he located her; Miss 
Smith had toppled onto one of 
the shelter’s many bunks and was 
groping about for her shoe. 
“I think I broke the heel off,” 
Miss Smith said. 
“Well, at least you got away 
with your life,” Major Hauk 
said. “If nothing else.” In the 
gloom he began., to assist her in 
removing her other shoe, it being 
worthless, now. 
“How long will we be down 
here?” Miss Smith asked. 
“As long as the Fnools are in 
control,” Major Hauk informed 
her. “You’d better change into 
76 
radiation-proof garb in case the 
rotten little non-terrestrials try 
H-bombing the White House. 
Here, I’ll take your blouse and 
skirt — there should be overalls 
somewhere around.” 
“You’re being really kind to 
me,” Miss S'mitifbfeathed, as she 
handed him her blouse and skirt. 
“I can’t get over it.” 
“I think,” Major Hauk said, 
“I’ll change my mind and go 
back up for that Scotch; we’ll be 
down here longer than I anticipated and we’ll need something 
like that as the solitude frays our 
nerves. You stay here.” He felt 
his way back to the elevator. 
“Don’t be gene long, % Miss 
Smith called anxiously after him. 
“I feel terribly exposed and unprotected down here alone, and 
what is more I can’t seem to find 
that radiation-proof garb you 
spoke of.” 
“Be right back,” Major Hauk 
promised. 
A t the field opposite the CIA 
Building, Captain Lightfoot 
landed the ’copter with the two 
captive Fnools aboard. “Get 
moving,” he instructed them, digging the muzzle of his Service .45 
into their small ribs. 
“It’s because he’s bigger than 
us, Len,” one of the Fnools said 
to the other. “If we were the 
same size he wouldn’t dare treat 
us this way. But now we under
GALAXY 
stand — finally — the nature of 
the Terrans’ superiority.” 
Yes,” the other Fnool said. 
“The mystery of twenty years 
has been cleared up.” 
“Four feet tall is still suspicious-looking,” Captain Lightfoot 
said, but he was thinking, If they 
grow from two feet to four feet 
in one instant, just by smoking 
a cigarette, what’s to stop them 
from growing two feet more? 
Then they’ll be six feet and look 
exactly like us. 
And it’s all my fault, he said 
to himself miserably. 
Major Hauk will destroy me, 
career-wise if not body-wise. 
However, he continued on as 
best he could; the famous tradition of the CIA demanded it. 
“I’m taking you directly to Major Hauk,” he told the two 
Fnools. “He’ll know what to do 
with you.” 
When they reached Major 
Hauk’s office, no one was there. 
“This is strange,” Captain 
Lightfoot said. 
“Maybe Major Hauk has beaten a hasty retreat,” one of the 
Fnools said. “Does this tall amber bottle indicate anything?” 
“That’s a tall amber bottle of 
Scotch,” Lightfoot said, scrutinizing it. “And it indicates nothing. However — ” he removed the 
cap — “I’ll try it. Just to be on 
the safe side.” 
After he had tried it, he found
BRUCE ELIOT UONE5 
the two Fnools staring at him intently. 
“This is what Terrans deem 
drink,” Lightfoot explained. “It 
would be bad for you.” 
“Possibly,” one of the two 
Fnools said, “but while you were 
drinking from that bottle I obtained your .45 Service revolver. 
Hands up.” 
Lightfoot, reluctantly, raised 
his hands. 
“Give us that bottle,” the 
Fnool said. “And let us try it 
for ourselves; we will be denied 
nothing. For in point of fact, 
Terran culture lies open before 
us.” 
“Drink will put an end to you,” 
Lightfoot said desperately. 
“As that burning tube of aged 
vegetable matter did?” the nearer of the two Fnools said with 
contempt. 
It and its companion drained 
the bottle as Lightfoot watched. 
Sure enough, they now stood 
six feet high. And, he knew, everywhere in the world, all Fnools 
had assumed equal stature. Because of him, the invasion of the 
Fnools would this time be successful. He had destroyed Terra. 
“Cheers,” the first Fnool said. 
“Down the hatch,” the other 
said. “Ring-a-ding.” They studied 
Lightfoot. “You’ve shrunk to oursize.” 
“No, Len,” the other said. “We 
have expanded to his.” 
“Then at last we’re all equal,” 
Len said. “We’re finally a success. 
The magic defense of the Terrans 
— their unnatural size — has 
been eradicated.” 
A t that point a voice said, 
“Drop that .45 Service revolver.” And Major Hauk stepped into the room behind the two 
thoroughly drunken Fnools. 
“Well I’ll be goddamned,” the 
first Fnool mumbled. “Look, Len, 
it’s the man most responsible for 
previously defeating us.” 
- “And he’s little,” Len said. 
“Little, like us. We’re all little, 
now. I mean, we’re all huge; goddamn it, it’s the same thing. Anyhow we’re equal.” It lurched toward Major Hauk — 
Major Hauk fired. And the 
Fnool named Len dropped. It was 
absolutely undeniably dead. Only 
one of the captured Fnools remained. 
“Edgar, they’ve increased in 
size,” Major Hauk said, pale. 
“Why?” 
“It’s due to me,” Lightfoot admitted. “First because of the cigarette, then second because of 
the Scotch — your Scotch, Major, 
that your wife gave you on your 
last birthday. I admit their now 
being the same size as us makes 
them undistinguishable from us 
. but consider this, sir. What 
ii they grew once more?” 
“I see your idea clearly,” MaGALAXY 
jor Hauk said, after a pause. 
“If eight feet tall, the Fnools 
would be as conspicious as they 
were when — ” 
The captured Fnool made a 
dash for freedom. 
Major Hauk fired, low, but it 
was too late; the Fnool was out 
into the corridor and racing toward the elevator. 
“Get it!” Major Hauk shouted. 
The Fnool reached the elevator 
and without hesitation pressed 
the button; some extra-terrestrial 
Fnoolian knowledge guided its 
hand. 
“It’s getting away,” Lightfoot 
grated. 
Now the elevator had come. 
“It’s going down to the bombproof shelter,” Major Hauk yelled 
in dismay. 
“Good,” Lightfoot said grimly. 
“We’ll be able to capture it with 
no trouble.” 
“Yes, but — ” Major Hauk began, and then broke off. “You’re 
right, Lightfoot; we must capture 
it. Once out on the street — It 
would be like any other man in 
a gray business suit carrying a 
briefcase. 
“How can it be made to grow 
again?” Lightfoot said, as he and 
Major Hauk descended by means 
of the stairs. “A cigarette started 
it, then the Scotch — both new to 
Fnools. What would complete 
their growth, make them a bizarre 
eight feet tall?” He racked his 
brain as they dashed down and 
down, until at last the concrete 
and steel entrance of the shelter 
lay before them. 
The Fnool was already inside. 
“That’s, um, Miss Smith you 
hear,” Major Hauk admitted. 
“She was, or rather actually, we 
were — well, we were taking 
refuge from the invasion down 
here.” 
Putting his weight against the 
door, Lightfoot swung it aside. 
Miss Smith at once hopped up, 
ran toward them and a moment 
later clung to the two men, safe 
now from the Fnool. “Thank 
God,” she gasped. “I didn’t realize what it was until — ” She 
shuddered. 
“Major,” Captain Lightfoot 
said, “I think we’ve stumbled on 
it.” 
Rapidly, Major Hauk said, 
“Captain, you get Miss Smith’s 
clothes. I’ll take care of the Fnool. 
There’s no problem now.” 
The Fnool, eight feet high, 
came slowly toward them, its 
hands raised.

I 
rrelevantly, Commander Yuri 
Hammlin realized that a prestar-traveling breed of Man 
would have been squashed dead 
by such high push, Never mind 
that, now, he chided himself. It 
would take sharp wits and a lot 
of push to get through this mission alive. 
He tensed his big, leathery mus
by J. 
R. 
KLUGH 
cles and just managed to squirm, 
without mechanical assist, to a 
new, more comfortable position in 
his padded combat pod. Fourteen 
kilo-g’s, he thought, breathing 
hard enough to feel the pseudo
fluid stir in his helmet. He was 
adapting well to the push. The 
crew had been, too. Soon they 
could up it a little more. They 
had to stay out of Grakevi disruptor range as long as they 
could. Hmm. He’d better check 
the range again. 
A broad viewset faced Hammlin out of the padding of his coffin-like enclosure. With practiced 
deftness, he held in mind the sequence of thought forms commanding: stern view! Part of the 
total shipboard software complex 
known as Shipmind recognized 
the corresponding pattern of 
brain pulses picked up through 
Hammlin’s helmet sensors as a 
command. The starfield astern, 
out to the standard display range 
of four hundred light-years, appeared in the viewer. A faint, 
wavering glow rimmed the edge 
of the view — the tunnel-like 
veil of the Solsmyga’s ionization 
trail. Hammlin noticed the slight 
motion of stars near the peripheral glow. 
What’s out mean speed of passage? 
.58 KILOLIGHTS, flashed the 
viewer. 
Spectral halos displayed 
around stars further astern dopplered increasingly down -frequency. And in the middle of the view, 
almost directly astern, gleamed 
two magnified blips. 
Hammlin studied the images of 
his pursuers. He was glad the rest 
of that Grakevi task force had 
finally turned back. Those two 
were enough. Shipmind: Range 
of hostile ships? 
8.78, 8.81 LIGHT-MIN. 
They were getting still closer, 
he thought soberly. Quickly he 
made sure his ferret ship was 
maintaining adequate weave amplitude for that proximity. He 
then ordered a highly magnified 
view of the Grakevi ships. 
The two big images in his viewer were roughly circular, but 
blurred. They continually faded 
and shimmered. Hammlin was 
seeing the impact-glow of space 
dust off the armored bows of the 
Grakevi ships. Staring at them, 
he thought-commanded, to duty 
command monitor : “Bob?” 
“Sir?” 
“What do you make of them?” 
Now I’d say raiders, sir, by 
their performance. Their mass 
would put them in the Grakevi 
equivalent of our Rapier class.” 
Shipmind! The hostile ships: 
What mass? 
23 KILOTONS EACH. 
“Yes, Bob, I think you’re 
right. Okay, that’s all.” 
“Yes sir.” 
TTJ aiders. Fast, long-range 
-*■*- craft. Built for hit-and-run attacks on suns and convoys. And 
well suited to running down ferrets, Hammlin realized, grimly, 
Altogether, forty-six kilotons 
against the Solsmyga’s fourteen 
kilotons. Heavier armor. Bigger 
disruptors. Either of those two 
alone , could burn them if it 
catches them. They were taking 
a big chance by just pretending 
this was a reconnaissance mission. 
Hammlin thought of tfieir 
course ahead. He had studied it 
to the point that he could picture it in his mind — all the way 
to Cairnsun. I hope it was well 
laid, he thought, fretfully. Well 
he knew how drifting matter 
could obsolesce astrogational 
files. How dangerous billowing 
dust could be if they hit it hard 
enough. 
He took a deep breath, and 
ordered: bow view! 
The view was Hazier than 
astern. Sensors near the stern 
had to peer forward through the 
ship’s ionization trail. The bulk 
of the ship both protected those 
eyes from dust impact and obstructed the view within a tendegree cone straight ahead. The 
ship’s weaving course shifted the 
blind spot about, however, and 
Shipmind built up a total view 
from successive sensor inputs. 
Stellar spectra shifted increasingly toward the blue. Had the 
stars not been light-years distant, 
hardening radiation and hysteresis drag would have threatened 
the ship. Secondary radiation 
and dust ionization could be severe, but the Solsmyga’s armored hull was built to take it — 
as long as the dust stayed fine. 
Sound me hull impacts! 
Hammlin thought-commanded. 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
Shipmind filtered out the 
squealing spacedrive, the sporadic popping rattle of space dust on 
the massive, plane surfaces of 
their bow. 
Sparse yet. Not much strain on 
the pilots. Nearer midpoint, 
though . Hmm. This was a 
long run to make at high push. 
They’d be going through it fast. 
Okay, cease hull sound! 
In the abrupt quiet, Hammlin 
relaxed for a moment from his 
restless checking on how his command was running. He was glad 
that strident ship sounds didn’t 
carry though to his combat pod. 
Immersed in the pseudo-fluid, his 
pale, muscular body bare but for 
plastic helmet and shorts, it 
would have been torture. The 
spring-dampened pod was restful, like a womb. Umbilical cables and tubes to his helmet and 
shorts enhanced the effect. 
]T\eliberately relaxing, Hammlin 
■L' saw their situation clearly. 
The HLS Solsmyga had been 
sighted by the Grakevi task force 
near a possibly hostile sun. That 
far Hammlin had fulfilled his 
mission. And as it turned out, it 
was a Grakevi sun. The prime 
planet had been scrambled years 
before, but Hammlin had detected two underground settlements 
being started on the next world 
out, even though it was a marginal habitat. That meant, he re

fleeted, that the two raiders 
astern would keep after them, 
trying to burn them before he 
could take back word of these settlements. 
It was tricky, this pretense of 
flight, without being free to really tty to lose them. Arid dangerous. Those raiders were hot. A 
new class of ship, maybe, with 
prime crews. This would take 
plenty of skill and push, or they 
would never reach Cairnsun. 
An itch distracted him. Straining mightily against the fourteen 
kilo-g push, Hammlin slid a hand 
across his hard body to where he 
could reach it. Ahh, that felt better, he thought, scratching. Mow 
he’d better see about getting the 
push up. 
Shipmind! Conference circuit; 
monitors and specialist staff! To 
body specialist: “Tolefante, I 
want the push upped again. Any 
problems?” 
“How much up?” 
“One kilo-g. Gradually, of 
course.” 
Well, from the cardiac traces, 
I’d say we can take it, but — ” 
“Fine! Medicate as necessary.” 
“ — But, uh ... Yes sir.” 
“Skipper,” broke in the hardware specialist, can we hold off 
the up-push a few minutes? I’m 
still getting in the repair-module 
replacement for one of the. stemward eyes. Changing push may 
damage it.” 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
Side circuit to mind specialist ! 
“Burton, those modules are engineered for over twenty kilo-g’s, 
peak. Try to juice up Harley’s 
morale a little more. Subliminal 
tigering, or something.” 
“Yes sir. A work engram of his 
was starting to act up-. I’ll try to 
cover it.” 
“Good!” Back to conference 
circuit! “Harley, we can’t put off 
the push, but it’ll be gradual. I’ve 
got confidence that you can cope 
with it, boy. Show me you can 
take it!” 
“Uh, yes sir. I’ll try.” 
“That’s 'the spirit! 
“Command monitor,” Hammlin went on, “are the Grakevi still 
closing?” 
“Yes sir. And duty jammer just 
reported changes in their code 
patterns. Nothing he could break, 
but maybe they’re getting close 
enough to try something.” 
“Okay, let’s not delay any 
longer, then. That’s all. Get set. 
Up-push coining!” Shipmind : 
End conference circuit. 
Gradual increase to fifteen kilog’s, mean push! 
UP PUSH TO 15 KILO-G’S, 
flashed a comer of the viewer, 
and Hammlin heard the warning 
repeated in Ms helmet speakers. 
In all twenty-two combat pods of 
his crew, he knew, the warning 
was being repeated. 
As the long-range ferret ship 
pushed harder and harder, 
Hammlin felt his breath coming 
tighter. Almost without thinking, 
he flexed one muscle and then 
another against the push. It was 
a hypnotic compulsion meant to 
speed his push adaptation. 
He was glad they were using 
the new pseudofluid. This MAZ80 was more buoyant than the old 
stuff. Good thing he had been 
able to get some. 
A rough mission, this one. 
Hammlin stared at the viewer. 
Those raiders weren’t dropping 
back very fast. He checked with 
Shipmind. So. They were upping push 1 , too. It frustrated him 
that the enemy should so nearly 
match his stamina. Any enemy 
achievement irritated him. 
“Think they’re pretty tough, 
86 
huh?” he husked through clenched teeth’, Their very name was 
in his mouth a curse. “Grakevi! Hrrach!” He glowered at 
the slowly dwindling blips. 
II 
T T ammlin remembered the day 
-*• he had been entrusted with 
this mission. He had been summoned to the office of Shoal-Staff 
Brigadier Odyn Stuart, back at 
5-L Sector Staff Headquarters. 
At the old man’s bidding, Commander Hammlin had eased his 
big, tough body into a comfortable chair by the desk, but he did 
not relax, not in Brigadier Stuart’s office. Stuart was a percep
GALAXY 
tive, calculating, strong-minded 
man, and he set a hard pace. His 
men never dared' call him the affectionately familiar “Ohm” Stuart to his face. Yet now, oddly, 
the Brigadier appeared to be in a 
remarkably mellow mood. He 
praised Hammlin for a recent 
daring reconnaissance, mused 
about a happier time — oh, how 
many years ago — when there 
was no desperate war situation, 
no vicious slaughter and counterslaughter, no scrambling, of planets in a widening no-man’s-space. 
The opposing forces were interpenetrating, he mentioned. Soon 
Sector Staff Headquarters would 
be moved further back. And what 
did Hammlin think of recent Grakevi pursuit tactics? 
But presently the Brigadier 
paused in his probing small talk 
to regard Hammlin thoughtfully. 
“Suppose we came upon a 
world that seemed ideal for settlement,” Stuart murmured, “but 
on which there was some serious 
hazard we couldn’t detect. How 
do you suppose we would deal 
with it?” 
For a moment the question 
didn’t make sense to Hammlin, 
and why had the old man asked 
it? Hammlin shifted uneasily in 
his seat under Stuart’s shrewd 
appraisal. 
“Well, uh, it would depend on 
the hazard, I would think” 
Stuart was silent. 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
“How can the hazard be detectable? I don’t understand.” 
“Hmm. Well,” Stuart suggested, “suppose this was a planet on 
which traces of LSD, or some 
such mind-expending drug, occurred naturally. There would be no 
way to detect it. The traces would 
be too slight.” 
“Yes. but one could infer the 
presence of the drug from the effects. The symptoms ...” 
Stuart shook his head. “The 
symptoms are initially too slight, 
too varied, too erratic. Too many 
other explanations can be given. 
In the beginning nothing is even 
suspected. And yet, over a long 
time — you see?” 
“Uh . yes. Yes.” How ghastly! In their present desperate need 
for strength the Helgad League 
would rush colonists to a promising world as fast as they could 
be settled. Whole settlements — 
thousands of the finest people — 
would be getting smoked. Pathetic! And if the cumulative 
brain poisoning was severe 
enough, they would eventually be 
dying of it without ever realizing that something was killing 
them. Only off-world eyes would 
see something amiss — but not 
in time . 
“Yes,” said Stuart, watching 
the troubled look come over 
Hammlin’s broad, bony face. “It 
can be dangerous. Very dangerous. Especially when you think 
of how long a government can 
take to react to even blatant facts. 
And the planet . well, such a 
planet is no good for settlement. 
But still, it has uses.” 
Q 'mart leaned back in his chair. 
^ Hammlin’s bushy blond eyebrows rose; his deep blue eyes 
showed question. 
“Look,” said Stuart, “suppose 
an enemy power can be lured into grabbling such a prize. Eh? 
With the right handling, it might 
be used to bleed ’em of men and 
supplies for years.” 
“Uh, yes ...” 
“Say there was valuable equipment there, to sweeten the bait,” 
added Stuart, warming to his 
subject. “Some partly built settlements. And a weak garrison fleet 
holding the star.” He leaned forward to emphasize: “In a situation like the present one, with 
both sides hungering for worlds to 
settle and draw strength from, 
the enemy would grab eagerly at 
such a world if we just lured them 
to it.” Leaning back in his chair, 
the old man added, almost as an 
afterthought, “The luring them to 
Cairn — that will be your job.” 
“You mean . you mean this 
world exists? A planet with 
LSD — ” 
“It exists. But . maybe it . 
isn’t LSD. We don’t really know 
what it is, but there’s something 
there, and it’s deadly.” 
Hammlin thoughtfully rubbed 
his chin as he turned this over in 
his mind. The room was quiet, 
but for the background susurration of Sector Staff Headquarters. 
“It’s addictive,” Stuart went 
on, running a hand over his closecropped white hair. “Take a man 
off Cairn who’s been there over 
six months, Ship Time, and he 
becomes so accident-prone that 
he usually gets' himself killed. Or 
he gets sick of something and 
dies. But once he’s been there a 
decade or two, he’s too stupid 
to even dress himself. 
“Yuri, it cost us plenty to find 
that out. Two million prime colonists lost, not to mention their 
installations. Now we’re going to 
try to get back the cost of that 
information. We want the Graks 
to pay for it. They’ve taken dozens of suns from us in recent 
months. Right on this front: 
Krag, Barnasun, Samli — all 
gone. We’re being pressed hard. 
Let’s see if we can’t funnel some 
of that pressure onto Cairn.” 
The two men stood up. 
“We’re counting on you, Yuri 
Hammlin. Here’s your memory 
card on the Cairn System, suggested tactics, all the data you 
might need.” The older man 
paused, then gripped Hammlin’s 
shoulder. Lure them to Cairn, 
Yuri. Hook them on that world. 
Hook them hard!” 
“I’ll do my very best, sir.” 
“That’s what I’ll be counting 
on. Good luck!” 
Hphe ship drove on. Hammlin 
rested, but after a time he 
roused himself again to check the 
crew. Third shift, he found, had 
just gone off duty, to be replaced 
by first shift. For each two-hour 
shift, four times a day, one of 
the • three command monitors 
watched over his two pilots and 
two weaponeers. Meanwhile, each 
of the three operations monitors 
watched through his shift as Shipmind ran maintenance checks on 
crew and ship. At his call for 
any complicated maintenance 
was the specialist staff : body specialist, mind specialist, hardware 
technician and software technician. 
The men seemed to be holding 
up fairly well, Hammlin reflected. 
Hmm. He wondered how piloting was going. Shipmind: Show 
me duty pilot display! 
Alternating views blinked at 
him. One showed ahead, and one 
astern. The views were speckled 
with navigation codes and course 
lines. Schmidt was a good man, 
Hammlin thought. He was showing plenty hunch-power. Good. 
That was just what Shipmind 
needs. Checking, Hammlin saw 
that the co-pilot was up to his 
task, too. 
Seeing then to his ship’s de
90 
fenses, Hammlin next checked on 
his duty weaponeers. The Grakevi were still beyond effective disruptor range, so the zapper was 
mainly helping the other weaponeer, the jammer, as ' he probed 
the enemy electronically. Hammlin saw the weird designs displayed in their viewsets: spectrum analyses, requests from 
Shipmind on how best to try to 
crack codes, dance patterns for 
target ranging past enemy jamming, and strategies for slipping 
craze patterns through enemy filtering. With Shipmind listening 
closely, the two weaponeers chatted conspiratorially, planning 
ways to do in the enemy. 
But, Hammlin reflected, their 
Grakevi counterparts were planning the same — with the Helgad 
in mind. And there were more of 
them. Two raiders worth! 
The ship fled onward. Tlie 
Grakevi fell back again, for a 
time, as the ferret pushed harder. 
Then they began to creep up once 
more. Hammlin meditated battle 
tactics. 
A stern chase, he thought. An 
adaptation contest, as usual. 
They were keeping to the high 
side of optimum push for fastest 
crew adaptation: just short of 
immobility. The Grakevi couldn’t 
push much harder without pilot 
gray-out. And pilot intuition was 
necessary to hold a clear course 
at these kilolight speeds.

Now, when the Grakevi got 
within effective zap range . 
Hmm. Weaving would make hits 
unlikely, at first. And most of 
the energy would be reflected off 
the sharply sloping sternward armor. At most, a few ship eyes 
would periodically be temporarily 
burned. The disruptor batteries 
were well shielded within the 
fluke notch. As the Graks got 
closer, though, the Grak disrupter 
flashes would burn hotter and 
hotter, he reflected. Each coherent flash, a searing pulse pattern 
keyed to hull absorption frequencies, could at closer range boil off 
centimeters of armor, leaving a 
smooth, shiny depression where it 
hit. 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
We had to avoid letting the 
Graks get close enough to be likely to hit with those big disrupters, 
Hammlin thought. Evasive maneuvers, chaff, jamming, flares, 
plasmoids — anything to confound them, to keep them at a 
distance until men reach Cairnsun. If men can make it to Caimsun, if they reached the Helgad 
garrison force there . 
fjphe Solsmyga had reached a 
push of 16.5 gilo-g’s when the 
Grakevi raiders struck. Hammlin had just awakened when — 
DUTY COMMANDER MONITOR, announced Shipmind. 
“Skipper, something odd Here. 
They’re still almost two light
91 
minutes away, but we’re starting 
to get continuous disruptor ranging pulses. Duty jammer’s been 
picking up new intership com. 
Says he thinks they just went on 
stereo zap-control.” 
“Uh, Donovan?” 
“Yeah. First shift’s on. Those 
Graks are tanging us like they 
mean business.” 
“For how long?” 
“Couple minutes.” 
Hammlin finally came all 
awake with 1 a start as he realized 
the situation: Shipmind! Go to 
mid-zap range battle weave! Dutycrew to full alert! Bring next 
shift up to standby alert! The 
viewer blinked acknowledgment. 
To command monitor: (Harry, 
I smell a trick! Get set!) 
“Right!” 
To duty operations monitor: 
“Any limp in the works to allow 
for?” 
“No, skipper. Ship’s tight.” 
“Good.” 
MACHINE STATUS: COMBAT READY. 
Good. Shipmind was on the 
job. Hammlin’s viewer showed 
excess power from the two fusion 
chambers bleeding off the hull 
radiators. 
CREW STATUS: COMBAT 
READY. 
Now to see what those Graks 
were — 
HOSTILE PURSUIT IS ZAPPING. 
Hammlin heard the characteristic scratchy splatter of disruptor 
pulses in his helmet speakers. 
But why? They were till too far 
away. Shipmind : Show me stern 
view! Report uncommon hostile 
action. 
Hammlin studied the two weav-' 
img, twinkling spots in his viewer 
as she thought-commanded: To 
duty command monitor: “Harry, 
what do you make of it?” 
CREW REACTION TEST: 
ONLY ENGAGEMENT 
RANGE UNCOMMON; reported Shipmind in the edge of the 
viewer. 
“Don’t know, sir,” said Harry 
Donovan. “A feint, maybe?” 
“Could be.” Had they just 
meant to spook him? Hammlin 
asked himself. Had he strained 
the crew unnecessarily? Had he 
lost us some tactical advantage? 
“Shall we cut back to range* 
limit weave, sir?” 
“Ah . yes, Harry — but do it 
slowly. Uh . how’s ECM?” 
Shipmind : Give me bow view! T o 
duty co-pilot: “Feel there’s anything ahead that they could be 
trying to herd us toward?” 
“Nothing fancy in ECM yet,” 
answered the command monitor. 
“No, sir. Course feels okay right 
now,” said the co-pilot. 
What should he' check now? 
Hammlin asked himself, closing 
his eyes in silent concentration. 
What could it be? 
“Duty zapper’s ranging, just in 
case,” the command monitor 
went on. “Jammer’s feeling them 
— hey! They’re zapping out of 
focus! Too broad to even burn the 
ship eyes. Wonder what hap — ” 
III 
f | through his closed eyelids 
Hammlin saw a flash of light 
on the viewer. A violent nervous 
jolt painfully twitched his body, 
dazing him. He gasped. His heart 
pounded. 
“Craze pattern,” he groaned, 
with waves of clammy chill running over his skin. Craze pattern! 
Shipmind, CRAZE PATTERN!!! 
Filter it!! Block it! Quick, filter 
it! A craze pattern! Don’t let another one through! 
Panting, Hammlin fought to 
calm his trembling. His eyes remained tightly shut against the 
possibility of another flash. It 
could kill him. Had Shipmind 
managed to set blocks against another one? 
He had to act fast — the 
Graks! What were they doing? 
He needed information! But . 
only ... The viewer! Was it 
craze-blocked? 
That had been a visual pattern, 
Hammlin thought. A powerful 
one. He shuddered at the memo-, 
ry. Even with his eyes closed, he 
Had got it bad! What had it done 
to tfie crew. Was anyone else left? 
94 
Had Shipmind set up craze 
blocks? What was the ship status? How could he find out without getting killed by another 
flash if he looked at the viewer? 
The helmet speakers! That was 
it! He’d get an acoustic report. 
Only, what if part of that craze 
pattern was acoustic? Calling for 
sound might bring Jt through. 
What should he do? 
Hammlin squirmed on the edge 
of a cold sweat. His hands fidgeted abstractly. He tried to visualize the present state of the ship. 
Could they have crazed Shipmind? Might they be about to? 
Shipmind : Beware of similar
method crazing attempt on Shipmind! Hammlin wondered if there 
there was any Shipmind left to 
get his thought command. If they 
would get Shipmind, he couldn’t 
do a thing. He was helpless! 
But wait. The ship was still at 
high push. Yes, and it was weaving, although it felt kind of jerky. 
How come? Pilots knocked out, 
probably. Or maybe something 
the Graks were doing. At least 
part of Shipmind must be up — 
he hoped! Hammlin swallowed 
anxiously. He had to get communication! 
He’d have to take a chance 
on the acoustics. If the Graks 
knew they’d got the Helgad . 
They must know! They must be 
pushing all they could to close 
in and finish things! 
He had to act! But, if there 
was an acoustic craze , . , He Had 
to do it! Almost convulsively, 
Hammlin thought-commanded, 
Shipmind: Report status acoustically! 
“SHIP STATUS IS — IN 
COMBAT,” reported Shipmind 
in its clipped feminine monotone. 
Hammlin let out his breath. He 
was still alive! Good old Shipmind! he thought. It was still up! 
Are filter blocks set up against 
repeat visual crazing? 
“CRAZE BLOCKING ACTION TAKEN.” 
Hoping it was effective, 
Hammlin cautiously opened his 
eyes. Shipmind: What is crew 
status? 
“CREW STATUS IS— FIRST 
SHIFT, ALL CASUALTIES. 
SECOND SHIFT, ALL CASUALTIES. THIRD SHIFT, ONE 
CASUALTY. THIRD SHIFT 
NOW GOING ON DUTY STATUS. SPECIALIST STAFF 
ONE CASUALITY.” 
TT'or a moment Hammlin lay in 
numbed silence. The greater 
part of his crew was out! Are they 
dead? 
“ALL CASUALTIES ARE 
LIVING, BUT ARE UNCONSCIOUS.” 
So. Maybe they still had a 
chance. Maybe enough men would 
recover to crew the ship through. 
But right now, they were in bad 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
trouble. Even third shift was incomplete. Shipmind: Who’s the 
casualty on third shift? 
“THIRD SHIFT CASUALTY 
IS JAMMER SECOND CLASS 
MURPHY.” 
So all his jammers were out. 
Who of the specialist staff is out? 
“SPECIALIST STAFF CASUALTY IS MIND SPECIALIST FIRST CLASS BURTON.” 
Burton! Just when the need for 
him was greatest! Just then 
Hammlin felt the ship’s weaving 
course becoming less jerky. Shipmind : Did the third-shift pilots 
just get on-line? 
“STATUS OF THIRD SHIFT 
PILOTS IS — ON DUTY.” 
Good! To duty co-pilot: “Pomeroy?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“Did the craze hit you? How 
do you feel?” 
“I’m okay, sir. I was asleep 
when Shipmind called me on 
duty.” 
“Fine! You and MacKinzie — 
don’t strain yourselves. You may 
Have a long shift. The pilots on 
the other shifts are hurt.” 
“Yes, sir. We’ll spell each other 
to make it last.” 
“That’s it! Now, take it as easy 
as you can.” 
“Okay, sir.” 
To duty command monitory 
“Bob?” 
“Yes sir. Zeitlin here.” 
“Did Shipmind say your view
95 
er was safe? Have you looked 
astern?” 
Uh, yes, sir. I just came on. 
Shipmind said emergency.” 
“That’s right. The Graks got a 
craze pattern through.” He hoped 
the stern view was craze-blocked 
on his viewer. He had to chance 
it. Shipmind : Give me a stern 
view! 
Hammlin blinked defensively 
as the view popped into his vie ,vset. He. was breathing a little fast, 
and very much aware of what 
could have happened if his viewer 
hadn’t been craze-blocked. But 
all he saw were two weaving blips 
twinkling brightly among the 
stars. 
“Hadn’t we better up push a 
bit, sir?” Zeitlin suggested. 
Range of hostile ships? 
43, 52 LIGHT-SEC., gleamed 
a corner of the viewer. 
So much closer since this had 
happened. A little more and they 
might have gotten everyone. They 
still might. 
“Yes, up it, Bob. You take it. 
Try to keep them back beyond a 
light-minute. But try also to not 
strain- your shift too much. The 
other two shifts were knocked 
out, and I don’t know how long 
you’ll have to be on.” 
“Okay, sir. I’ll do my best.” 
“Good!” To body specialist: 
“How are the casualties?” 
“Sir, all the casualties are unconscious. Some are in serious 
condition. I haven’t had time to 
check them all specifically, yet. 
Sliipmind is running suggestive 
first-aid and breath-input medication already, of course. They 
show Symptoms of a very severe 
recent trauma. In fact — ” 
“Make it snappy, Tolefante. 
How’s Burton?” 
“I hadn’t gotten to him yet, 
sir,” answered Tolefante, sounding hurt. 
“Well, get on it! We need him 
badly.” 
“Yes, sir. If that’s what you 
want, sir.” 
Surly, smart-aleck pup! He was 
straight out of med training, and 
he thought he knew everything! 
npo software technician: “Vledervoe, you running down that 
craze pattern?” 
“Yes, sir. A bad one. I caught 
a little of it myself.” 
“How do you feel?” 
“Okay, sir. Not much of it 
came through this viewer.” 
“That’s a relief. Now look — 
here’s what I want you to do: 
First, make sure Shipmind is filtered so we don’t get another one 
in the same way. Secondly, get 
fixed up any damage the one that 
got through did to Shipmind. And 
finally, find out how the Graks 
did it. Let whoever’s standing in 
for duty jammer know as soon 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
as you find out. Got that?” 
“Uh, yes, sir,” answered Vledervoe, uncertainly. “That’s what 
I’m doing. But you don’t mean 
strictly in that order, do you?” 
“Do it any way it goes fastest, 
but those are the priorities.” 
“Very well, sir.” Yledervoe 
sounded relieved. He was very 
liberal-minded. After years of 
software experience, he thought 
almost like Shipmind. 
To duty operations monitor, 
Hammlin thought-commanded : 
“Otto, are you on?” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“What damage did the Graks 
do while we were out from that 
crazing?” 
“Is that what it was, sir? Uh, 
not much, it seems. A playbackshows that Shipmind was on its 
own for only about a couple of 
minutes. During most of that 
time it shows the Grak disrupters 
were awfully weak, or out of focus or something. They only 
shined through the radar camouflage in a couple of places. Hardly took any armor off. 
“The bow armor is kinda pocked up, though. Down three centimeters in places. Not serious on 
eighty-centimeter armor.” 
“We still have a long way to 
go.” said Hammlin, quietly. 
“Yes, sir. That we do.” 
“Otto, you better leave the 
hardware pretty much to Harley 
for a while. I want you to give 
Tolefante all the help you can 
with the crew. Keep him moving. 
We’re just riding on third shift. 
No reserve.” 
‘‘Okay, sir. I’ll do that.” 
“Good man.” 
Hammlin paused a moment, reviewing the situation. He had to 
conserve himself, too, he realized. 
There was no telling how long 
they would take to deal with the 
emergency. He noticed that he 
was pressing harder into his pod 
padding. Oof — Zeitlin was really 
getting the push up, he thought. 
Must be that the Graks didn’t 
want to lose range. This was plenty strain. But leave the man be. 
He’d better see what Tolefante 
Has found out by now. 
Shipmind: To body specialist: 
“What have you found out, Tolefante?” 
“Burton just regained consciousness, sir, but he’s in bad 
shape. He’s babbling incoherently.” 
Ohipmind! Give me mind specialist pod view and sound! 
DIRECTIVE 478: FOR OPTIMAZATION OF OVERALL 
VESSEL EFFECTIVENESS, 
MORALE OPTIMAZATION 
OF THE COMMANDING OFFICER SHALL HAVE PRIORITY A17. 
PERSONNEL MORE QUALIFIED THAN THE COMMANDING OFFICER ARE 
98 
AVAILABLE TO AID CASUALTY TREATMENT. SHIPMIND COMPUTES AVOIDANCE OF COMMUNICATION 
OF THE COMMANDING OFFICER WITH BATTLE CASUALTIES AT OR ABOVE PRIORITY A17. YOUR LAST GIVEN ORDER IS REJECTED. 
— SHIPMIND. 
Of all the blasted nerve. Some 
nardy bureaucrat made rules, and 
he couldn’t get to his men! 
Hrrach! 
“Okay, Tolefante,” said Hammlin, grimly. “You take care of 
him. You fix him up good, and 
you do it fast! I need that man!” 
“Sir, I’m the body specialist, 
not — ” 
“I don’t care wEat you call 
yourself! You’re supposed to be 
cross-trained in Burton’s specialty as well. If you can’t remember 
your lesson, ask Shipmind!” 
Hammlin snapped off contact 
with a brusque thought-command, and lay silent in his combat pod to let his temper cool. 
After a moment Shipmind announced, FROM DUTY OPERATIONS MONITOR: (Uh, sir? 
I thought — maybe you’d want to 
know about the other casualties?” 
It was Otto Zagorsky, sounding 
very meek. 
Realization came to Hammlin: 
that the operations monitor had 
been monitoring Tolefante, as his 
task required, and had heard it 
all. It annoyed and chagrined 
Hammlin that he had displayed 
his temper thus — to the possible 
detriment of the ship — but it 
was done and past, now. 
“Yes, how are they?” He asked 
in a more even voice. 
“Well, sir, apparently the pattern going through the first shift 
jammer viewset was the worst. 
Beck is in a coma. It’s bad, sir.” 
Zagorsky paused cautiously. 
Hammlin waited. 
“The rest seem to be gradually 
coming out of it, sir,” Zagorsky 
went on. “They look like they 
were having nightmares. Some 
worse than others. Except for 
two: Leinster and Stewart. They 
are conscious, but not making 
much sense. We’re running some 
of the therapy routines in Shipmind to them, and to the others, 
too. It’s helping, but I don’t 
have much idea how long it’ll 
take. Too bad we don’t have Burton available. He could work the 
therapy a lot better.” 
Yes, well . Do your best, 
Otto. Burton especially. And see 
about juicing up Tolefante’s morale, a little if it’ll make him any 
faster. Shipmind just sassed me, 
and I blew up at him.” 
“Yes, sir. I’ll do that, sir.” 
“Good. That’s all.” 
So, thought Hammlin, staring 
thoughtfully at the blanked viewset. Leinster and Stewart: the second shift pilot and zapper. But 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
would they recover in time? 
Would enough of the others? If 
they didn’t, he knew, the exhaustion of third shift would leave 
the ferret a robot, without a crew. 
It would lack the intuitive skill, 
the feel for the situation that was 
needed to avoid most of the dense 
space dust and Grakevi zapping. 
They would never reach Cairnsun. The mission would fail. 
It must not fail. Too much depended upon it. Ohm Stuart was 
counting on him! 
IV 
'T’vays passed. The continual 
sizzling splatter of disrupter 
pulses sounded in Hammlin’s helmet speakers. He’d better leave 
that sound a while, he thought 
exhaustedly. It would keep him 
reminded that those Grak raiders 
were just light-seconds behind. 
Knowing the danger would help 
keep him awake. 
The high-push swerving of the 
ship jarred him. Fourteen days in 
combat, he mused. It was telling 
on all of them. 
If only their luck held. It was 
not long to midpoint, now. If they 
could just make it through midpoint . 
His body ached. He could only 
move without mechanical assist 
during moments of down-push 
for doppler evasion. When the 
ferret up-pushed again, the strain 
hurt him. He felt that he was 
starting to get bedsores. 
Peaking to eighteen kilo-g’s, 
now, he reflected. To the genetic 
limit of their adaptability. Up 
peak push much more, and it 
play summary of crew health, he 
thought-commanded. Studying 
the data which appeared in the 
viewset, he was dully saddened by 
the ultimate state shown for Beck 
and Pomeroy. How many more, 
HIS SOLSMYGA. 
(LRF- 87ZH) 
11 disrupters 
face forward, 
(J\ baktev iesofe) 
8 disrupbovs 
face aft 
Of Batteries cfz) 
would kill them — as it Had killed Pomeroy already. 
He was the second loss so far, 
Hammlin thought, remembering 
the third-shift co-pilot. Beck had 
been the first to go. Beck, the 
jammer on first shift, had never 
come out of coma after the Grakevi craze pattern hit him. He had 
lingered three days, then perished 
as the ship jerked about, dodging 
violently, to avoid being zapped 
as it darted through a narrow gap 
opening across a dust cloud. 
Hammlin’s sense of duty urged 
him to see to his men, again. Dis100 
yet? He wondered. Would any of 
them make it? Who could know. 
They’d try, though. They had to 
try. 
Hammlin absently rubbed an 
itch high on his bald scalp against 
the inside of his helmet. That 
felt better. 
At least the rest of the crew 
had pretty well recovered, he 
thought. It was slow, but a big 
relief all the same. It had been 
hard on them. That opening craze 
pattern had interfered with their 
push' adaptation. 
It was a near thing, for a while, 
GALAXY 
Hammlin remembered. With 
third shift becoming exhausted, 
and the other two shifts still very 
shaky, he had Had to juggle along 
on the last bit of endurance of 
first one man and then another. 
Building back up from that ordeal had been difficult. The 
Grakevi had never let up. 
Qhipmind : Show stern view, 
^ again, Hammlin ordered. He 
studied the motions of the zapping raiders. Abruptly the viewset blanked protectively as a nuclear flare shell went off. Seconds later the view faded back in 
to show the fireball falling faster 
and faster toward the raiders. 
They swept by, dodging easily, 
and it dwindled into the distance. 
Shipmind : How long until midpoint? 
MIDPOINT COMES IN 132 
MINUTES. 
Hmm. It didn’t seem like such 
a short while since he had last 
checked. Maybe he was getting 
tense. Well, there was no time 
just to lie here fretting. He had 
to see how Shipmind was coming 
with midpoint tactics calculation. 
Hammlin tried to help Shipmind, but it was hard to concentrate in the jouncing corSbat pod. 
His back felt sore where it had 
pressed too long into the padding. 
Shipmind announced, FROM 
SOFTWARE TECHNICIAN: 
“Uh, Skipper?” 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
“Yes, Vledervoe?” He sounded 
badly tired, too, thought Hammlin. 
“I found out the rest on what 
that craze pattern did,” reported 
Vledervoe in his dry, studious 
voice. “Or anyway, about as 
much as could still be found out.” 
“What is that?” 
“Well, as I mentioned before, 
when they keyed that craze pattern through their disruptors, the 
pulse hit the outer overhead eyes 
hard enough to crosswalk over 
to the second-level visual reduction lines before it would have 
reached the first set of block 
points.” 
Circuit logic diagrams showed 
on Hammlin’s viewer Hammlin 
quickly contracted them to just 
a corner of his viewset so he could 
also keep watch astern. 
“Uh, it also apparently jumped from the VR lines to the overhead VR disc-waffle leads,” Vledervoe went on. “That’s how it got 
into number three visual buffer 
an F tier. I was mistaken before 
when I said it came straight 
through the VR lines. The second-level VR lines have filtering 
on CJ10 level. In fact — ” 
“Wait, there,” Hammlin interrupted. “Have you told duty jammer?” 
“Uh, the jammer — yes, sir. I 
just did.” 
“Okay. Now then, what remains to be healed up?” 
“Well, it went through Bank 
74, mucking it up. From there it 
spilled into the end of viewset interface storage. At that point a 
machine hypnotic translated and 
took control of three autoprocessors. Uh, yes, I’m pretty sure it 
must have been three of them. 
That is, the read-around dump 
digest showed — ” 
“I’ll take your word for it,” 
said Hammlin impatiently. 
“Uh, okay. Well, the parasitic 
unfolded and spilt craze pattern 
through most of the duty switches in the last eighteen interface 
buffers. The primary association 
channels in those buffers are all 
lost.” 
“Hmm. How bad is that?” 
“Uh, well. I’ll have to splice 
new association linkages for Area 
40C as soon as I can find the subject needs. Most of the thought 
routines that were clobbered are 
on the system back-up library, so 
there’s no problem there, but 
M5578LL is changed, and I’ll 
have to rig up a new one. 
“Overall, I mostly just have to 
take care of interpretation to the 
viewset displays, yet. Two or 
three days more, and I should be 
finished. Most of Shipmind functions that were affected are working now. We just have to look 
out for a little interpretive amnesia at random moments until 
those linkages are going through 
again.” 
“Hmm.” Hammlin considered. 
“We’re reaching midpoint soon. 
To what extent would you say 
this, ah, amnesia will hamper us?” 
V ledervoe thought a moment. 
“It’ll be all right,” he concluded. “The combat report functions are all running. It’s just that 
stellar background codes may not 
update promptly at times, for instance. Or hull thermal displays. 
“Shipmind knows what they 
are, but presentation may be off,” 
Vledervoe added'. 
“Can’t we, uh, sort of tap 
through to the right information?” 
“It’s not as simple as that. The 
build-up functors have to get the 
same data the crew gets, for feedback to cerebral telemetry evaluation. Otherwise crew reactions 
will start running up reaction error in Shipmind.” 
“Oh. Well . you say we’ll 
get essential data through midpoint, though, huh?” 
“Yes, sir. No problem there.” 
“Okay, well, let’s have it fixed 
as soon as we can. But keep yourself ready for any emergency 
damage we may take getting 
through midpoint.” 
“Yes sir.” 
Hammlin broke contact. That 
Vledervoe! he thought. Good 
thing he knew his stuff. Hammlin didn’t know the half of what 
he had been talking about. Like 
Burton, with his mind-oriented 
jargon. 
A good thing Burton Had soon 
recovered enough to help. The 
boys had picked up a lot faster 
after he was able to start directing therapy. 
That had been a hair-raising 
episode, Hammlin remembered: 
Tolefante, Zagorsky and Shipmind hanging on with what advice Burton could give between 
delirium and fainting spells. Shipmind had even got worried 
enough to let him in on how it 
was going on. Hah! 
In the viewer, eerie little lights 
flittered through space astern as 
disrupter zappage cut through 
puffs of dust where chaff spells 
had exploded. Despite long familiarity, the sight fascinated 
Hammlin. 
Presently he closed his eyes to 
rest them. He became aware of 
his tiredness, again, and he felt 
itchy. What a strain he thought. 
Then — 
FROM DUTY OPERATIONS 
MONITOR, announced Shipmind: “Skipper? Adler here.” 
“Yes. Go ahead, Izzy.” He was 
in better shape than most, 
Hammlin noticed from the voice. 
“Sir, we just lost another sternward disrupter. A pulse came 
through the rotary shield just as 
she bore. Messed up the laticing. 
The electron-focused optics are 
all shot.” 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
“You mean it won’t take sharp 
focus?” 
“No, sir. And reflection is so far 
off that it could burn out if we 
overrode and zapped it anyway.” 
“Mmm. Okay, better shut it 
down and close the shield.” 
“Yes, sir.” 
“That’s three out of eight, 
now.” 
“Yes, sir. Just minor occlusiori 
on the other five. They’re still 
bright enough to give a good 
burn.” 
“Okay. See that they bear close 
and hot at midpoint. It won’t be 
long now.” 
“Yes, sir. They’re ready for 
fast tracking.” 
“Good. And how’s midpoint 
checkdown coming?” 
“Okay, sir. Almost finished.” 
“Fine. Run me a damage summary when you’re through.” 
“Yes, sir.” 
Hammlin broke contact. He 
sighed. Five sternward disrupters 
left, he thought. Well, they would 
not be needing the sternward batteries much longer. Not after 
midpoint. 
T n the viewer, distance made 
-®- even the nearer stars seem to 
flow sedately, though their mean 
speed was almost three kilolights. 
He couldn’t remember ever passing at this high a relative speed, 
before. Hammlin felt a bit of a 
thrill as he watched. This was a 
long run they were making this 
mission. 
Compared to tKe ferret ship 
and its pursuers, the stars were 
almost stationary, relative to each 
other. At midpoint the ferret 
would have to reverse the push 
— to begin slowing — if it was 
to come to rest with respect to 
Cairnsun on arrival. But when 
the moment came to slow, what 
of the pursuing raiders? 
Shipmind: How long now to 
midpoint? 
MIDPOINT COMES IN 78 
MINUTES. 
It would be dangerous, Hammlin reflected. He could only hope 
they came through it. 
The view astern flickered in
cessantly, now, as enemy disruptor pulses came close. As the 
range had shortened, the ship’s 
dodge circle relentlessly contracted. The big, bright disruptors the 
raiders mounted weren’t missing 
so often, anymore, npr by so 
much. 
FROM DUTY OPERATIONS 
MONITOR: “Sir, here’s the 
damage summary.” 
“Okay, thank you, Izzy.” 
The report appeared in Hammlin’s viewer. He studied it 
thoughtfully. The drive seemed to 
be holding up well, he noted, 
reassured. All gyroplasms were 
swinging smoothly. 
Primary fusion chamber was 
ticking a little out of tune, 
Cowles 
Co-Pihk 
V 
though. He’d have to watch that. 
He studied the sonic hull trace 
a long moment. It showed most 
of their sternward-sloping radar 
muffling burned away, but that 
didn’t matter. What worried him 
was the thinness in places of their 
sternward armor, especially on 
the fluke. Maybe it would last, 
he brooded. If they burned 
through before midpoint . 
With a taut sigh he went on to 
the rest of the report. 
The damage to Shipmind from 
that first craze pattern penetration had been reported by Vledervoe already. A second craze pattern had got through a day later, 
and for a time it had silenced 
all their disruptors, but that damage to Shipmind was already repaired. At least they had got one 
back at the Graks, Hammlin 
thought, remembering how, for a 
few seconds, one of the raiders 
had lost push, almost dropping 
out of the chase. The Graks on 
that one really must have sweated 
to catch up again, he hoped. 
The weaving of the ferret jostled him about in the viewsetlit gloom of his combat pod. In 
his tiredness, the pseudofluid felt 
chilly, but he dared not order the 
temperature raised. Nor would 
Shipmind probably have obeyed, 
he realized, for in that greater 
bit of comfort he might fall 
asleep, despite the ravening enemy behind them. 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
T T ammlin felt an itch on his 
thigh and wondered if he 
could reach it at this push. It was 
cold as a tomb. “HmpH!” he 
snorted. He was getting down. 
Better have Burton juice him up 
with a little more vim. See to it, 
Shipmind. The view blinked asknowledgment. Oh, that itch! 
Hammlin started working a hand 
toward it. 
In the viewer, he saw glowing 
coveys of erratically darting 
plasmoids fall quickly astern. 
More followed them as they vanished. They weren’t much of a 
threat to the enemy, Hammlin 
thought, but at least they helped 
confuse his zap-control. 
The itch went away before he 
could reach it, leaving him vaguely frustrated. He stirred in his 
mind, wondering what to attend 
to next. 
Shipmind : How long until midpoint? 
MIDPOINT COMES IN 59 
MINUTES. 
Operations monitor finished his 
midpoint checkdown, Hamlin reminded himself, slowly. The ship 
was as ready as it was going to be. 
The crew . uh, first shift was 
on. Shipmind, we better go over 
to second shift a few minutes — 
uh, seven minutes — before midpoint. Keep first shift on active 
back-up through midpoint, so we 
10 5 
sional advice from Burton, he 
tried to prepare them for peak 
performance. 
MIDPOINT COMES IN 16 
MINUTES, flashed the viewer. 
Shipmind, Hammlin knew, was 
weighing the merits of assorted 
midpoint gambits. As the tactical configuration varied, Shipmind was opting for first one, and 
then another. When midpoint 
came, it would execute its choice 
of the moment. 
It was good to have Shipmind 
for such tasks, Hammlin felt. And 
yet . and yet, Shipmind wasn’t 
absolutely infallible. Depending 
on it too much made him uneasy. 
The flickering viewer showed 
him the two flashing blips astern 
weaving to and fro against the 
stellar background. The obstructive ejaculations behind which the 
ferret tried to hide itself dropped 
toward the foe and beyond. 
He wasn’t getting enough feel of 
their weave, Hammlin sensed, as 
he studied them. He needed more 
detail. Shipmind : Insert secondorder weave codes! 
Additional symbols appeared 
by the Grakevi raider images and 
also superimposed on the wavering ionization veil at the margin 
of his view. Reading them, 
Hammlin grasped better the why 
of their current motion. 
All three ships were jerking 
about in random evasion, but the 
ferret was also trying to stay in 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
the blind spot directly ahead of 
first one raider and then the other. The raiders pitched and yawed to bring their forward-facing 
disruptors more nearly to bear 
straight ahead, but they couldn’t 
wag too far over without space 
dust scouring their disruptors, 
quickly ruining them. 
As the raiders swerved, both to 
avoid possible mines in the ferret’s wake and to bring their disruptors to bear, the ferret swerved 
also. Sometimes it swerved away, 
forcing the raiders back toward 
it in pursuit. Sometimes it swerved with them, trying to stay in a 
blind spot. The dance went on 
and on. 
Still watching, Hammlin thought 
forward to midpoint. Surprise was 
the essence in this, he reminded 
himself. If they could reverse 
push unexpectedly enough to get 
past the raiders before they could 
begin slowing much, the men had 
a chance. They would surely go 
by too fast for the Graks to have 
time to burn the ship badly. 
On the other hand, Hammlin 
realized only too well that if the 
raiders began slowing almost as 
soon as the ferret, their pace 
would almost match that of the 
ferret as it passed them. There 
would be a furious exchange of 
disruptor pulses which the smaller, weaker ferret could not hope 
to survive. As they cut through 
it, and the ship sensed dire in
107 
don’t lose continuity. Have third 
shift at emergency standby. 
Hammlin yawned. Then, rousing himself, he wondered, if he 
had given those orders before, 
already? He couldn’t quite remember. Could he have given 
conflicting orders. Hmm he didn’t 
know. Oh, well, Shipmind could 
figure it out. It was a good thing 
Shipmind had enough judgment 
to allow for the state of the ship’s 
complement in obeying orders. He 
felt rotten. 
EAT, ordered Shipmind. 
Dully, Hammlin obeyed. The 
slurry he sucked through his helmet nipple had several peculiar 
tastes in succession, before it finished coming. Hammlin waited 
for a bit, and belched. His beard 
had grown beyond bristliness, and 
he could feel his breath stir it 
in the pseudofluid. Familiarity 
dulled his senses to within bare 
toleration of the cesspool flavor 
of the pseudofluid. Gack, it was 
strong. A man could almost tell 
how long he’d been in combat by 
the reek. They ought to hurry up 
and redesign these pods to stay 
clean no matter what. 
The ship had put drugs in his 
nourishment, and his grogginess 
cleared somewhat. The urgency of 
the situation took hold of him. 
Not much time left! 
Shipmind: Did you take my 
crew disposition? The viewer 
blinked acknowledgment. So. 
106 
Hammlin considered the effects 
of the impending assignments on 
his men. Harry might take it a 
little hard if he pulled first shift 
off just before midpoint, he reflected, picturing Low Commander Harry Donovan’s bluff 
personality in his mind. He might 
get the idea that Hammlin didn’t 
trust him for the big moment. It 
might hamper his effectiveness. 
Hammlin didn’t want that. He 
was their best command monitor. 
It wouldn’t do to go building 
his ego up to the extent that the 
others ultimately felt low, though. 
Hmm. 
Well, he’d see. Shipmind! To 
duty command monitor: “Harry, 
I’m glad first shift has been holding up so well. I know it’s a strain 
on you, by not having Beck to 
handle jamming, but for the sake 
of continuity do you think you 
can stand back-up to second 
shift through midpoint?” 
“Why, uh, sure. We’ll stand 
duty spot if you want.” 
“Thanks Harry, but I’ll want 
a fresh shift carrying most of the 
load. No reflection on your shift, 
mind you.” 
“Okay, sir. As you say.” 
T hat was a relief, Hammlin 
thought. Having done what 
he could to reconcile Donovan to 
a subordinate role, Hammlin then 
went on to have a word with the 
others of his crew. With occa
GALAXY 
jury, capture-safe circuits would 
trigger bothi fusion chambers and 
nuclear munitions, and the ferret 
would be no more. 
H ammlin didn’t like that 
thought. This wouldn’t do! 
Come on. Ship mind : Give me a 
little more subliminal optimism. 
EUPHORIA IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO MIDPOINT SURVIVAL. 
Hammlin stared at that message in the viewer. Cheerful, aren't 
you? he grumbled inwardly at 
Shipmind. Huh! 
ASSISTANCE, PLEASE. 
CONSIDER THIS MIDPOINT 
OPTION. 
Okay, okay. Slave driver! 
But then the thought of his responsibility, of his command, stiffened Hammlin’s self-discipline, 
and he brought his able military 
mind to bear in quest of flaws 
to the gambit shown in his viewer. 
Abruptly he remembered: There 
wasn’t much time left! 
The minutes ticked by, and 
gradually Hammlin helped Shipmind work out an optimum envelope of strategies. When midpoint came, the ferret would try 
to slip back down its own wake, 
darting through' a screen of chaff 
puffs and interference shells laid 
down a moment before. 
If we could slip down the blind 
spot of at least one of them . 
Hammlin advised, engrossed. 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
Hmm. But not so much chaff, I 
think. We don’t want it to tip 
them off. 
And that trigger pattern for the 
echo shells looks a little obvious. 
How about — 
THE TRIGGER PATTERN 
GIVES MAXIMUM PLASMOIDAL OCCULATION FOR A 
STAGGERED REVERSEHORVATH DEFENSE HELIX. 
— Oh, I see. Okay. But do it 
a little more this way. Hammlin 
thought-sketched in the viewer. 
Shipmind made changes. Finally, 
they compromised. 
Another thing, Hammlin added: We could fire a couple torpedoes for extra interference. We 
mustn’t overly risk knocking the 
Graks out, though. We still have 
to lead them to Cairnsun, 
The thought gave him pause. 
It was awfully risky, this business, he reflected, uneasily. Like 
a hare entrapping foxes. 
Well, let’s see . one torpedo 
astern, just before midpoint, to 
hide us as we go off push. Then 
another one right after midpoint 
to blind them momentarily as we 
close — as we thought we were 
diving out of sunlight. Yes, that 
should do it. Got that, Shipmind? 
The viewer blinked. 
The ferret still carried eight of 
its total allotment of seventeen 
torpedoes, all fitted with standard 7000 niegaton warheads. 
They were for slow, unwary prey, 
being low push (twelve kilo-g’s), 
Short range (eight light-min.) 
and stupid (strictly robot control). 
Shipmind, you better launch, 
another one in auto-pursuit, now, 
so the one at midpoint won’t warn 
them, Hammlin thought-commanded. He glimpsed the bulky 
torpedo as it popped out. Like a 
shot it vanished. The viewer 
blanked. 
IX/hen the view faded in again, 
* ’ he saw a bigger, brighter 
glow than that given by the 
flares. Maybe that one dusted 
their disrupters, some, he hoped 
as he watched. The raiders swung 
aside fast as the fireball fell past. 
Every bit helped, but he wished 
they could mess up the Grrak 
sternward batteries. The Graks 
would be zapping the bow planes, 
if the men made it through. 
He’d better take a last quick look 
around, now. Shipmind! Show me 
bow view! The viewset showed 
hard starlight shifted as far to 
the blue as Hammlin could remember ever having seen it. Some 
of that was coming through the 
shielding, he noted. Good thing 
they were about to start slowing. 
In his helmet speakers, the impact of space dust against the 
hull was now a rattling roar. 
Even the ablative paste Oozing 
out of the armor capillaries could 
no 
not keep the hull from eroding at 
this pace, he realized. Trying to 
minimize it had been putting a 
hard strain on the pilots. Well, 
it wouldn’t pit so fast, by and by 
— except for disrupter zappage. 
Shipmind! Now give me jammer view! 
From the viewer a torrent of 
information gushed at him in the 
form of seething three-dimensional color patterns. The ships radiated ECM and ECCM back and 
forth like savage beasts screaming and snarling at one another. 
The enemy was echo-ranging continually, but during the delay 
across light-seconds of space, the 
ferret warbled push, to doppler 
away from the absorption frequencies to which incoming disrupter pulses were keyed. The 
raider zap-control systems calculated probabilities and compensated for spectral shift as best 
they might. 
ECM echo shells further hid 
the ferret by bouncing out a profusion of false returns. Variably 
programmed echo delay and frequency shift made the little echo 
shells hard for the enemy to discount. 
Plasmoids, chaff and flares 
further dirtied the view. Shipmind 
analyzed the spectrum to the extent that could be expected of 
quick but dull robot calculation. 
To this the jammer added his 
skilled human perception. 
Ophe duty jammer ID code 
flickered, and Hammlin 
glanced at it. Sorensen Kad just 
gone on, he noted. Second shift 
was phasing in. Less than seven 
minutes to midpoint! 
To duty command monitor : 
“How’re you feeling, John?” 
“Good enough, sir,” answered 
Line Officer 1C Mortensen, steadily. “Burton ran second shift 
through a tone-up just before we 
came on.” 
“That’s fine.” And he was feeling pretty good, himself, come to 
think of it, Hammlin realized. 
Burton must have done him subliminally, too. 
“Uh, Harry’s backing you up, 
you know, but he put in a hard 
shift. It’ll be mostly up to you.” 
“Yes, sir. We can manage. We 
are in good shape.” 
“That’s what I like to hear, 
John. We’re — ” 
MIDPOINT COMES IN 4 
MINUTES. NOW STARTING 
FINAL COUNTDOWN. 
In Hammlin’s viewset shone a 
representative of the familiar statue, Helgad Man, Embattled. 
From his helmet speakers came 
the opening notes of We Fight. 
That gave way to a stirring strain 
of Heroic Ever Onward. The 
hymn faded away, leaving behind 
a crackling splatter of disruptor 
zappage, and the statue dissolved 
into the view astern. 
“Grakevi — hrrach!” Hammlin 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
spat his hatred in a snarling hiss 
at the pursuing blips. Shipmind! 
To crew: “This is it, men. Let’s 
show those Graks what it’s like 
to close on Helgad fighting men!” 
Thinly, despite the push, the 
crew growled back its common 
challenge. The sound gave 
Hammlin a shivery thrill. 
3 MINUTES TO MIDPOINT. 
Hammlin felt himself growing 
more taut, excited. He strained 
and squirmed, levering himself to 
a new position in his jostling 
combat pod. Beyond the occasional distant thrumming of shipboard machinery, there was now 
silence. A steadying tone-up pattern showed in the viewer. Anything more to suggest to Shipmind? Hammlin wondered. Had 
they overlooked anything? No . 
not that He could think of. 
2 MINUTES TO MIDPOINT. 
Hammlin and his crew cleared 
their minds for fast action. Ship 
and men merged strongly into a 
single fighting entity. Hammlin 
lay passively ready to give his 
quick reaction on whatever Shipmind chose to show in his viewer. 
1 MINUTE TO MIDPOINT. 
The muffled pattern of cannonfire seemed to change as they 
muddied their wake. In the viewer, Hammlin saw a torpedo flick 
away. They were counting on 
that tHing, he thought. He saw an 
inside-out view of the sternward 
hull, all shiny from disruptor 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
zaps. Ho! Not much chance of 
their burning through there any 
more! 
MIDPOINT. 
VI 
Hph'e viewer blanked. The push 
went off. Hammlin gulped. 
The pod swung around on its 
spring-dampened gimbals. Abruptly the push surged on again. 
The viewer glimmered back to 
life. 
Six seconds ticked by and the 
raiders came sweeping around the 
torpedo fireball — still at high 
push. The ferret hurtled toward 
them, like a shell down an endless 
succession of cannon barrels. The 
raiders began to slow. They started to roll, and their disrupters 
flashed like Gatling guns. 
Stay in a blind spot! thoughtbellowed Hammlin, shaken before such a storm of zappage. 
The ship jittered, as though 
hesitating at the order, then 
plunged into full view of both 
raiders. 
Why, why? Hammlin felt 
helpless in the face of doom. It 
was a high-speed nightmare. Why 
had they left the ship’s wake?! 
ATTEMPTING TO SKIRT 
NUCLEAR BARRAGE. 
Oh — yes, I see it, now! We 
won’t make it! 
The ferret jerked in violent' 
evasion of disrupter zappage. 
Hammlin wondered if the crew 
could take this? 
Around the edge of the view 
appeared contorted, bearded 
faces. Then appeared another 
portion of the crew, also staring 
wide-eyed as the enemy swelled 
toward them. A final push-strained group grimaced from the viewset and was gone. 
The ship was fighting with 
computer haste, and everything 
seemed to happen at once. No 
time to think — hardly even to 
give Shipmind one’s snap feelings. 
The ferret hit the fringe of the 
nuclear flare barrage. The barrage lit up, and the ferret streaked through nuclear brilliance. 
The ship hit a near miss with a 
jolting lurch, and Hammlin 
caught his breath in agony. He 
barely saw the raiders flash by in 
a blur, zapping wildly. And then 
they were past. 
It had happened so quickly. 
Hammlin found himself shaking. 
His heart was pounding. He began to flex and strain his big, 
aching muscles, working out the 
tension, and discovered some 
sprains. At least he was still alive, 
he thought, wryly. But what 
shape were they in? How badly 
were they hurt? 
Shipmind: Show me a damage 
report! 
Hammlin made a quick check 
of the ship. 
nphcy had been holed in three 
places on the sternward hull. 
One gouge was too big for the 
healing mechanism to plug entirely, and uncoagulated meteor 
absorption fluid streamed from 
the lead. That would drain that 
panel, Hammlin realized. No 
trouble there, now, but it could 
be a problem as they approached 
dirtier space near Caimsun. 
And there was radiation leakage in seven outer compartments. 
Well, they would just have to 
make do with it. 
Now, how about the crew? 
Shipmind! Report crew status! 
CREW STATUS: FIRST 
SHIFT— 2 CASUALTIES. SECOND SHIFT— 0 CASUALTIES. 
THIRD SHIFT — 3 CASUALTIES. SPECIALIST STAFF —

ARE STILL COMBAT-ABLE. 
Oh oh. They had been hurt all 
right. Shipmind : Identify and

B oth the medspecs! That was 
bad. It would be up to the operations monitors and Shipmind, 
now, unless Tolefante recovered. 
He wondered how badly Tolefante was hurt. Second shift was on. 
Shipmind: To duty operations 
monitor: “Gordy, how badly 
would you say Tolefante is hurt?” 
“Uh, Tolefante . So-so, sir. 
Some torn muscles. Rather painful. And internal hemorrhaging 
— but it’s almost contained now. 
He may be a bit crippled, but 
he should recover.” 
“Okay. Thanks Gordy. Now, 
how about the others?” 
Line Officer 2C Gordon Frazier reported similar, though 
mostly less severe, injuries of the 
rest of the casualties. 
“Okay, Gordy,” said Hammlin as he finished. “You’re doing 
all you can to get them back in 
shape, right?” 
“Yes, sir. The other op monitors are helping too.” 
“Okay, that’s good. Carry on.” 
“Yes, sir.” 
Hammlin thought of Kis 
wounded. He had snapped impatiently at Tolefante on several 
occasions, and now, with Tole
115 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
fante hurt yet needed, Hammlin 
felt uncomfortable. Tolefante 
just didn’t seem to be made for 
this kind of service, Hammlin 
reflected, defensively. If he got 
through this mission, Hammlin 
would see about transferring him 
out. Yeah. That was what he’d 
do. 
Seven more men were out, on 
top of two earlier dead. Hammlin 
hoped he could juggle crew assignments to keep the ship adequately manned 1 until more recovered again. But then, he could 
expect more casualties, at this 
high push. Manning the ship 
would get progressively harder. 
Well, at least they had gained 
a respite. The Graks had gone 
clear beyond effective zap range 
before they matched. 
'T'he ship struggled on. Hammlin’s command patched and 
healed itself as best it might 
before the reapproaching Grakevi raiders engaged again. Grollnek was the last to regain consciousness. He was out thirteen 
hours. The steady recovery of 
his five injured men cheered 
Hammlin, but he also thought of 
the dead. 
Poor Schmidt, Hammlin lamented'. That midpoint jerking 
had been too much for him. They 
had missed him. He had been a 
good pilot. 
And Burton! They had depend
116 
ed on him so. Could they manage 
themselves through the mission 
— could they reach Cairnsun — 
without him? 
Hammlin tried to ignore the 
bleak emptiness he felt at the loss 
of each of his men. Beck — his 
mind blasted by the Graks. And 
now, three more they had pushed 
to death. Grakevi! Hrrach! But 
just wait and see , you — you 
Graks! We’ll pay you back, yet! 
Three days later Cowles died. 
His combat pod malfunctioned. 
One of the pseudofluid filters 
sprang a leak, and he perished 
slowly, gasping, as the pod pressure went down and the push 
squeezed him flat. Hammlin 
shuddered at the memory of how 
he had looked — before Shipmind cut off the view. Cowles 
was the second-shift copilot. 
It was hard to think straight, 
now, and to direct the ship. This 
push was hurting them all, 
Hammlin realized. MacKinzie 
and Grollnek, especially. Those 
two, the third shift pilot and 
zapper, were in anguish from cumulative internal injuries. Nothing more they could do for them, 
Hammlin regretted. Beyond what 
emergency pod medication Tolefante could give, there was no 
help for them. 
This awful push was really 
what was killing them, but he 
had to keep at high push if any 
of them were to survive. The 
Graks were hounding them to the 
limit of endurance. 
Hammlin felt a special bond 
with Helgad men who had fought 
thus at high push. Only the hardiest survived such engagements. 
It was from such survivors, the 
toughest veterans, that new breed
E ver more slowly the three 
ships dropped toward the 
brightening gleam of Caimsun. 
The patter of space dust became 
gentler, sparser. Shipmind could 
steer with less human assistance. 
It had to. 
Of the ferret’s crew only a cou
ing stock was drawn in settling 
new worlds. The best of the best! 
Hammlin liked to express it. And 
two million such comrades had 
perished on Cairn. In vain? No! 
They would never fail their honored fallen, Hammlin promised 
himself. He glowered his hatred 
at the two spots of twinkling disrupted light in the viewer. And 
he ached of the push of eighteen 
kilo-g’s, 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
pie at a time still managed dr lly 
to watch their viewers. The rest 
were sunk in painful stupor. The 
Grak crews must be in about as 
bad a shape as they were, Hammlin guessed, or the raiders would 
have exterminated the Helgad by 
now. 
Could they still make it? That 
oscillation of the primary fusion 
chamber was getting worse. Bit 
by bit it was losing output pow
117 
er. He doubted they could keep 
the drive at push on the secondary alone. 
The ferrett continued to lurch 
evasively, stirring eddies in the 
fouled pseudofluid of Hammlin’s 
combat pod. He felt sick. It was 
an effort to keep his stomach 
steady. 
Trying to maintain a feel for 
the tactical situation, Hammlin 
kept a bow view and hull scanning trace in most of his viewer. 
He listened to the scratchy 
splatter of disruptor zappage. He 
was tired and on edge. 
They were taking hits oftener, 
he fretted. Would the forward armor last? The Graks were so 
close now — just a few light- seconds ahead of them. 
Hammlin watched as Cairnsun continued to approach in the 
distance beyond the craft of his 
enemies. 
Don’t launch torpedoes, yet, he 
cautioned Shipmind. Don’t signal 
the garrison too soon. First give 
the enemy a long, close look at 
the system. Yes, that’s the way. 
Only . only, he wondered 
how much more of this they could 
take? 
He was exhausted. He lost consciousness for a few minutes. 
Slowly, under Shipmind’s stimulation, he recovered. 
T T ammlin studied a crew Health 
-*■ summary in the corner of 
his viewer. Poor Gordy Frazier 
— he was dying, Hammlin 
grieved. He could be the ninth. 
Eight men they had already lost. 
Eight men — rotting in their 
pods. Well, it wouldn’t be much 
longer — 
A small puncture appeared at 
the edge of their forward armor. 
Shipmind! Signal quickly — 
now! Hammlin snapped. Before 
they zap through that hole! 
Their three last torpedoes flipped out and were gone. As seconds went by, the ship roused 
the crew for one last effort. 
Why didn’t the torpedoes go 
off? Hammlin worried, fearing 
that the Graks had zapped them 
all? 
He wondered desperately how 
they might yet gain time. More 
chaff and echo shells? No — they 
were already down to the last of 
them. Dodge harder? A little 
more push? But they couldn’t 
stand any more push! 
Far down, well beyond the 
raiders, a bright burst bloomed. 
Beautiful! Hammlin crooned to 
himself. Just beautiful. Now if 
they could Hold on a little longer .. 
The ferret dodged and zapped 
feebly. Taut minute followed 
minute. Then the bow was holed 
again — a bigger gap, this time. 
. No! thought Hammlin, staring. 
The next hits would gouge right 
through them! 
But then the raiders were shifting away. They had had their 
look, and meant to get clear of 
Cairnsun before Helgad interceptors got out to them. 
And the Grakevi vessels passed beyond effective disruptor 
range, the ferret ceased dodging 
and eased off the push somewhat. 
“Ahhh!” breathed Hammlin, 
relieved. That felt much better! 
Creakily, he began to move and 
rub himself. His body was sore 
and stiff. 
In the viewer He saw five interceptors appear far ahead. Already they were veering fast toward the fleeing raiders that the 
ferret was pointing out. They had 
to make it look real, Hammlin 
reflected with satisfaction. Must 
not let the enemy suspect. And 
then, at last, he could peacefully 
sleep. 
VII 
A year and a half Had passed, 
and Hammlin lay sprawled 
in a transport berth, luxuriating 
in idleness. The transport was 
pushing along at an easy fifty 
g’s. This was the life, he thought 
with a happy sigh. He had earned his reward. 
The Solsmyga had been two 
months at Cairnsun for emergency repairs. Then, with five passengers hitching rides in their 
spare pods, and nine coffins 
GOLDEN QUICKSAND 
frozen in the third afterhold, they 
joined a passing convoy back 
to 5-L Sector Staff Headquarters. 
The ferret ship had won a 
unit citation. The entire crew received the Everlasting Hero Seal. 
Hammlin was awarded the Seal 
with Crossed Comets. And he was 
promoted to Colonist, with the 
rank of Lieutenant-Patroon. That 
rank entitled him to eleven wives, 
and a stake of thirty-eight gold 
kilograms. 
Enough wealth to make a good 
start, Hammlin mused, absently 
patting the hard, smooth ripples 
of his stomach muscles. Enough 
for a large spread of ranch land, 
perhaps. Or maybe part ownership in some business. 
And eleven wives — oh, man! 
He could just see them! Hammlin pictured in his mind’s eye 
the fair, bold-eyed, strapping 
young women he had seen from 
time to time in news reports as 
they started on their way to colony worlds. Smart, hard-working 
and patriotic, they were said to 
be. The pick of planetary forces 
finishing industrial service. 
Mmm, delightful! Hammlin 
nodded to himself, stretching 
what he imagined to be a lusty 
grin across his face. The fatherhood urge was already strong 
upon him. 
Now, on the way to Geyn, His 
future homeworld, Hammlin had 
been taking programmed courses 
on investment and personnel 
management. They seemed welldesigned courses, Hammlin 
judged. He was learning a lot 
from them. Only . well . He 
simply had to face it: He hadn’t 
known a real woman in years. 
Just the simulators, between missions. 
That was hardly adequate 
familiarization, he was sure. He 
needed pertinent preparation. But 
- — what was he to do? The nearest thing he had’ been able to 
find at the PX on dealing with 
wives was this office-oriented personnel course. 
So how could He apply such 
stuff in this case. Hammlin worried it over, perplexed. Were 
wives, uh, like secretaries — but 
with added functions? Or were 
they a kind of ... of subordinate manager, only intimately female? 
Or what? 
And how could a man best 
discipline them? What should he 
do if there was interwifely rivalry? Blast it, this husband thing 
was going to take some doing! 
Hammlin squirmed on his 
berth — almost as though he 
were in combat pod, preparing to 
engage Grakevi. 
Yet, when he had conscientiously tried to find out by asking around, what did he get. He 
snorted. Big laughs, and nothing 
more. A lot of big laughs. Bah! 
120 
T T ammlin scowled at the gray 
bulkhead above him, but 
slowly a wry smile glimmered 
through' his annoyance. The crew 
was pretty funny at that, he realized, remembering the cautious 
kidding, the sham concern, the 
suggestions offered in mock seriousness on how best to cope with 
his future responsibilities. Even 
Brigadier Stuart had smiled a 
trifle broadly as He congratulated 
Hammlin at the formal award 
ceremony. 
It was a lovely medal. And the 
last mission with the Solsmyga 
had been completely successful, 
the Brigadier confided, later. A 
strong enemy fleet rushed to 
Caimsun within months. In fact, 
to the Grakevi the sun was of 
such high strategic value that, 
according to Helgad intelligence, 
the enemy had started building 
up Cairn headquarters planet. 
But they would not guess the 
reason for the difficulties they’d 
soon start having. Helgad raiders 
would see to it that they suspected sabotage, instead. 
Now that was good news! 
Hammlin smiled, with satisfaction. Cairn would really be an experience for the Graks! He was 
glad he was not going to a world 
like that. He propped his massive 
legs up against the railing of hig 
berth' and thought soberly of 
How it would be on Cairn. 
Of course, he mused to himself* 
GALAXY 
the cost would be fantastic, certainly, but if the Graks packed 
enough people onto Cairn, they 
might in the end get a surviving 
population that was immune to 
whatever the hazard was. And 
then what? Would the adapted 
people be even more formidable? 
The possibility alarmed Hammlin. How could men win, he asked 
himself, if disaster, survived, only 
made their enemies stronger? 
Hammlin worried at the question. Presently, out of his pondering crystalized a hint of an 
answer: Men must be stressed, 
too, he concluded. The Helgad 
must up push on their own evolution. They must evolve faster 
than the Grakevi! 
Yes, yes, he grumbled to himself after a moment, but how? 
Deliberately scourge themselves? 
No, that would weaken Helgad 
solidarity. Men would tend to 
turn on the source of torment. 
It would have to be an outside 
affliction imposed upon them. 
“Huh!” Hammlin snorted. How 
could they arrange for that? And 
how could they control this uncontrolled hazard so that it would 
not wipe them out altogether? 
How could they set it so their 
suffering gave them the greatest 
possible evolutional advantage 
over the Grakevi? How could 
they even know what trend would 
turn out to be an evolutional advantage?

THIS SPACE CONTRIBUTED BY THE PUBLISHER g® 
He'd given the Earth every chance, 
and it had failed him. Now he was 
on another Earth, facing a new life ! 
A s usual, there were two of the 
Ranidae standing guard outside the temple, waiting for the 
god to make his appearance. 
Huge, brownskinned, and ninety 
per cent humanoid they were; the 
only visible differences were the 
rather ropy hair and the blank 
eyes — actually, eyes covered 
with a nictitating membrane, for 
the Ranidae had evolved from a 
nocturnal order of creatures and 
found the light of their own sun 
almost too fierce for them. 
Dane found it pretty fierce 
himself; by now he was almost 
as brown as they were. Rana’s 
sun was a dwarf, but on the other hand, Rana was only forty 
million miles away from it. Even 
up here in the northern mountains the temperature hit eighty 
by mid-afternoon. And come to 
think of it, his own red hair had 
gotten pretty ropy by now, too, 
along with his mustache. He had 
not had a real haircut or a proper bath in three years. 
He looked out. The guards 
were fiercely imposing in their 
Vermillion ceremonial harness, 
the chest of which bore a dimly 
glowing sun-disk. That, however, 
was deceptive. The Ranidae were 
actually rather a gentle race, as 
well as an impressionable one. 
They had their share of personal quarrels, but apparently had 
not had a war for nearly a century; nor did they have any real 
nations, only clans. The battleaxes the guards carried were in 
observance of this, for technologically the race was quite up to 
producing ballistic missile weapons ; they simply hadn’t had any 
need to invent them. Otherwise, 
they seemed to be in a state of 
development roughly corresponding to that which had been attained by Europe and the United 
States circa 1895. 
Dane put on his pressure suit, 
except for the helmet — ceremonial trappings, after all, were 
expected of him, too — and 
started the airlock cycling. It 
was time for the daily apparition. 
Nearly a century of progress to 
lead these people through; that 
was a heavy responsibility, even 
for a god. 
That was why thus far, He fiad 
limited each apparition to only 
a few minutes. He meant to take 
it slowly. The mess “progress” 
had made on Earth was not going to be duplicated here — not 
if he could prevent it. 
But he had hardly emerged 
from the temple when the guards 
bracketed him, like a salvo of 
muscle. “What’s this?” he said, 
as steadily as possible, considering that he was outweighed by 
better than four to one. 
“You must come with us, Divine One.” 
“Who says ‘must’ to me? Why? 
I refuse.” 
OUR BINARY BROTHERS 
They paid no attention. “You 
must come with us,” the first 
speaker said patiently, and together they began to herd him — 
not obviously, but firmly — down 
the mountain. 
He gave up protesting. God 
or no god, he abruptly felt peculiarly puny. 
T t is nowhere recorded in the 
sacred books of Rana that 
the god’s full name was (or rather, had been Anglicized to) John 
Hillary Dane, nor that he had 
been born the son of the chief 
of state of a Balkan duchy which 
had once — in the Middle Ages 
been an empire. Nevertheless, 
steps were taken early to prevent his becoming a mere duke. 
When he was nine years old, his 
country was swallowed by the Soviet Union, and he found himself in the United States, on his 
way instead toward deification. 
It did not take him long to 
reject the even lesser role of prospective head of a governmentin-exile, but only in favor of a 
smoldering aloneness which made 
him first a poet, then a Wellsian 
utopian, then a Trotskyite, then 
a pacifist, and finally — the 
only logical outcome of all these 
taster and influences — a mathematician specializing in communications theory, cybernetics and 
related disciplines. These sciences 
were then (toward the end of 
World War II, when he had just 
turned 21) in their infancy, and 
Dane — immune to the draft by 
virtue of a diplomatic passport 
— grew with them. Shortly he had 
talked his way into the presidency of a very small company 
which made light-amplifying devices for astronomers, and turned these devices into a line of 
self-focusing three-dimensional 
cameras for dub photographers 
which made him a multi-millionaire before he was thirty. 
Which' did not assuage his dissatisfactions in the least. He did 
not even convert the passport; 
citizenship did not tempt him. 
Though he had been up on the 
mountain, he was sure he was 
meant to go higher. 
While he deliberated, without 
knowing that that was what he 
was doing, his already large firm 
had become involved with the 
military and had become a giant. 
Thanks to several additional and 
basic inventions of his own and 
of a highly imaginative chief engineer, fully eighty per cent of its 
sales were now to the Department 
of Defense. And of these, about 
half turned out to be remarkably 
adaptable either to spying on other people or to keeping dossiers 
on them. He did not hold himself wholly responsible for the 
concomitant creeping change in 
American life, and by infection 
that of the rest of the world; but 
he could not absolve himself. 
Much more immediately, the 
rewards of the world now included a wife who had changed somehow (the fault was perhaps his) 
from a fairy-tale princess into 
a managerial witch; a daughter 
who had taken to hopping from 
pad to pad in a black sweater 
and sawed-off chinos with her 
only valuables — her toilet articles, chiefly Pills — in a brown 
paper bag; and a son who, after 
a brilliant record at a tough private school, had gotten himself 
thrown out of Kenyon for losing 
interest in everything but Art 
Nouveau and loud guitars. 
Unlike most gods, Dane did 
not know that he had already 
been crucified. He took a mistress; she was a girl of considerable complexity and warmth, she 
loved him totally, and she bored 
him green. In a final attempt at 
compensation (though, again, he 
did not know that that was what 
it was, let alone that it was final), 
he turned to philanthropy on a 
large scale, handing out massive 
endowments and subsidies to 
projects which marginally satisfied his now-buried utopian 
streak (though he was not aware 
of this motive, either) . In selfdefense, the family tried to have 
him committed as incompetent; 
and still — since he defeated the 
move so easily — lie failed to get 
the point. 
And then, abruptly He did. 
One of his philanthropies had 
been the underwriting of a 200inch telescope in Chile; and one 
of the first discoveries of the 
completed, $30-million observatory had been that the Sun is a 
double star. The dwarf companion is about the same size and 
brightness as Proxima Centauri, 
and it is about 12,000 AU — or 
about a sixth of a light-year — 
away; its year is 1,300,000 Earth 
years, so that its proper motion 
is one second of arc per year; 
and there are more than nine hundred other stars in Earth’s sky 
which are brighter, every one of 
them farther away. Until Dane 
Observatory had become functional, it had never even been 
mapped before, let alone suspected to be a companion of the 
Sun. 
And a tell-tale wobble in its 
orbit showed that it had one gasgiant planet at least as big as 
Jupiter — and might have more 
and smaller, worlds. 
John Hillary Dane’s star did 
not rise in the east. It had always been there, standing over 
the South Pole, invisible, even its 
proper motion disguised by the 
precessing of the equinoxes. 
One year and nearly a billion 
dollars later, there was no longer 
any such person on Earth as 
John Hillary Dane. Three years 
after that, John Hillary Dane 
OUR BINARY BROTHERS 
was a god, going down a mountain between two axemen. 
(S| do not believe in the gods,” 
the Panechruse said, perhaps a little defiantly. “I quite 
understand, Isser Dane, that you 
are most powerful in knowledge, 
and perhaps in force. But I have 
also a more than good guess 
where you' come from, and I 
can’t allow you to mislead my 
hill tribes any longer. We are 
not so advanced in the sciences 
as you; but we are no longer superstitious. Should you do us 
the credit of granting us that, 
we’ll be prepared to defer to 
you a considerable distance. We 
need you, certainly. Equally obviously, you need us. You are a 
long way from Home.” 
The Panchruse was undeniably 
impressive. So was his city, 
which would have compared favorably with any carefully planned Earth capital of, say, the late 
19th Century; and his seat of 
government was startlingly reminiscent of a clean Paddington 
Station. That is to say, it looked 
much as the Crystal Palace must 
have looked just after its completion, unsmoked by time, undestroyed by fire. There were 
not so many arc-lights as the 
Crystal Palace must have had — 
the Ranidae’s eyesight could not 
Have tolerated that many — but 
all that, a style of engineering 
quite as muscular as the Ranidae 
themselves. 
Even more impressive was the 
language, as easy to learn as Esperanto, here far closer to being 
universal than Esperanto had 
even hoped to become backhome, 
much more abortive of new words, 
and in the hands of a man like 
the Panechruse, almost frighteningly more forceful. Though 
Dane had never found the six 
other languages he knew nearly 
as satisfactory as English, he did 
not miss English on Rana. 
He picked his response very 
carefully indeed. 
would be interested to hear,” 
-*■ he said, “just where you 
do think I come from.” 
“From a planet of our companion star,” the Panechruse 
said. “We can easily see ...” 
(Had Dane after all brought 
his helmet, which’ would have 
kept him continuously in touch 
with the temple computer, he 
would have been saved a great 
deal of headwork in converting 
Ranan metrics to his own on 
the spot. Briefly, from Rana, 
Earth is 17.4” away from the 
Sun, or perhaps 100 million miles, 
and seems to have an albedo of 
about 0.7 — 20 percentage points 
too high. From this, the Ranidae 
guessed its minimum diameter to 
be 20,000 miles including atmosphere. The Radinae worked 
126 
all this out backwards from 
studying Jupiter, which from 
Rana is 1’29” degrees of arc 
away from the Sun and hence 
easily resolvable.) 
“Very precise,” Dane said. 
“We are a scientific people. 
You will understand that we were 
in some doubt as to whether so 
large a planet could support life, 
but we realized that we might be 
over-estimating its size; it is too 
close to your sun for us to photograph.” 
“You did, by more than a hundred per cent, even counting the 
atmosphere. In fact, of our ten 
planets, only ours supports life.” 
The Panechruse nodded briefly. “But that is not the issue. I 
tell you this only to demonstrate 
that were not as backward a 
race as my hillmen might have 
led you to think. We’ve made 
rapid progress, especially since 
the invention of the steam telephone made fast long-distance 
communications possible.” 
Dane wondered if he somehow 
mis-translated, then dismissed the 
problematical telephone as a 
technicality. “I congratulate 
you,” he said. 
“We require much more. We 
would have progressed even faster had it not been for the hill 
people, who are traditionalists — 
ini fact, reactionaries. It’s very 
fortunate for us that they have 
accepted you as a god. We will 
use that to overcome their resistance.” 
To what?” Dane said. 
“To progress, of course, Isser 
Dane. What else?” 
“I suggest,” Dane said slowly, 
“that you think twice about the 
matter. On my world, we allowed 
technology to overrun the entire 
planet. Except, the last I heard, 
for a few large deserts. It wiped 
out all the small enclaves of disparate cultures, like a plague. Later we realized that just such diversity was invaluable to us — 
but by then it was too late.” 
“Are you a criminal?” the 
Panechruse said abruptly, unveiling his large eyes like an 
alerted cat. 
“I beg your pardon? I think I 
may have misunderstood you.” 
“I think not. You imply that 
your people have achieved a 
world state. You speak against 
it. And you are here, on the nearest planet to your own that will 
support your kind of life. These 
facts suggest that you are at the 
very best an exiled dissident, or 
counter - revolutionary. Which’ 
further suggests that your world 
is a humane state; otherwise you 
would have been executed, or imprisoned.” 
'Tphe mixture of truth, reason-*■ able nonsense and implicit 
threat in this speech left Dane 
floundering for a moment. No 
OUR BINARY BROTHERS 
reply would do, he decided finally, but the absolute truth, 
though he was sure it would 
sound equally nonsensical to his 
antagonist. 
“We do not have a world state,” 
he said slowly. (We have three 
large states, though they have 
grown to be very like each other in all important respects. None 
of the three is in the least humane. They are machines, and 
they treat their people like spare 
parts. I am indeed an exile, as 
you deduced — but by my own 
choice. In my state I was a 
considerable power, and was on 
my way to becoming even more 
powerful. I rejected it. It was not 
what I wanted, and had I stayed 
home, I would have been compelled to accept it.” 
The Panechruse leaned back 
upon his throne and crossed his 
huge arms. 
“Either the psychology of your 
race is utterly different from 
ours,” he said, “or you are lying. 
Since the psychology you imply 
would make the construction of a 
vast technology impossible — 
and since your ship shows that 
the technology in fact exists — I 
conclude that you are lying. That 
is dangerous I advise against it.” 
“We have no uniform ‘psychology,’ ” Dane said. “We differ 
from each other, just as you do.” 
“No such difference could be 
great enough to make a Pane
127 
cKruse think and behave like a 
hill man. Builders do not destroy, 
nor leaders follow. Isser Dane, I 
advise you for the second time 
not to persist in this fabrication. 
Though we need you, we can also make your life very unpleasant. You may either be our guest 
— though we did not invite you 
here — or we will mine you to 
exhaustion like a natural resource. The choice is yours.” 
“What do you want of me?” 
Dane said, rather more sullenly 
than he had intended. 
“That’s better, Isser Dane. 
Well, then, we require technical 
guidance — and, in the hills, 
your services as a god. By the 
way don’t consider leaving us. 
There is no place on Rana where 
you wouldn’t be conspicious 
enough for me to find out; and 
as you doubtless observed as you 
approached our sun, Rana is the 
only local planet on which you 
could survive at all.” 
Abruptly, the idol-like features 
contorted in what might have 
been a smile. “Of course,” the 
Panechruse added, “you might go 
back home. But I think you cannot — no matter how differently 
we might explain that to each 
other. If you can prove me wrong 
on this point, you need no further invitation from me to try it.” 
There was no arguing any of 
these points, that was certain. “I 
will do my best,” Dane said, as 
128 
ambiguously as he dared. “But 
I’m sure you also know that if 
I’m to help you, I’ll need my 
ship. It contains all my tools.” 
“Obviously. However, we are 
running a telephone pipe to the 
ship when it is completed, I expect you to be in daily communication with me, or whatever 
equerry I appoint. And let me add, 
Isser Dane, that should you decide to help us unstintingly, the 
rewards will be considerable.” 
No, doubt, Dane thought. Just 
the kind of rewards I ran away 
from. 
But he let the guards escort 
him out in silence. 
T>ack on the bridge of the tempie ship, he shucked off the 
pressure suit, went hurriedly to 
the toilet — a convenience his 
company technicians, who had 
not been told precisely what they 
were building, had neglected to install in the suit — and, the distraction relieved, resumed thinking at speed. 
Of one thing, and one thing 
alone, he was certain : He was not 
going to help the Panechruse reorganize Rana into another technological hell on the Earth model. If possible, he had to impede 
any such attempt, or even stop it 
in its tracks. 
But how? He could of course 
lift ship, set down next to the 
Crystal Palace, and let the Nemst 
generator blow. That would eliminate the Panechruse, the palace, 
the capital city and John Hillary 
Dane. It might also provide an 
abject lesson in the black side of 
Progress. All he needed to do was 
persuade the hill men — who 
worshipped him, after all — to 
bring him about 25,000 liters of 
water to process for reaction 
mass; the processing would take 
a week, and surely the Panechruse’s steam line wouldn’t reach 
up into these raw and distant 
mountains in anything under that 
time, no matter when it had started. It was a step the Panechruse 
could not possibly frustrate. 
Dane rejected it almost as soon 
as he had begun to think about it. 
There had to be some strategy 
which would not involve the 
murder of several million innocent Ranidae and the fouling of 
the atmosphere the rest of them 
breathed; that first notion had 
been Earth thinking at its typical worst, all empiricism and no 
mercy. The Ranidae had decided 
a century ago that all killing except in direct, person-to-person 
self-defense was murder; was 
Dane to reverse that decision on 
his own arbitrary whim? No. For 
that matter, the god was not 
ready for self-immolation yet, 
either. 
Well, wKat then? There had 
been the germ of another idea in 
there somewhere. Could he simOUR BINARY BROTHERS 
ply drag his feet? Design nonworking engines? Do everything 
the most wasteful and expensive 
way? Wear out their patience? 
No. 'The Ranidae were intelligent; they would catch him at 
it. And besides, they could learn. 
No matter how much he managed to slow up Progress, it would 
gain momentum eventually. At 
the very best, no matter how 
many sabots he might manage to 
throw into the works, he would 
not live forever — and to an intelligent class even teacher’s fakery would provide clues. 
Perhaps a Claudian policy 
might be the answer. The Ranidae understood steam — he was 
now sure he had not misinterpreted the word. They were also 
impressionable, and short-lived 
compared to men despite their 
burliness. It would be relatively 
easy to turn the whole planet 
into a British Midlands — an 
inferno of coal smoke, lung cancer, belt-transmission factories, 
child labor, beehive towns, — the 
works, even the economy, within 
Dane’s remaining lifetime. After 
an object lesson like that — 
After an object lesson like 
that, he realized grimly, they 
would charge right on. Individualistic Earthmen had drawn few 
morals worth noticing from the 
Midlands experience. The psychologically far more uniform 
Ranidae would go right on wor
129 
shipping Progress thereafter, convinced that the theory was sound 
— or the religion — and that 
nothing had gone wrong but the 
practice. And, Dane now remembered, the Claudian policy had 
not worked even for Claudius; instead of provoking revolt and 
thus bringing back the Republic, 
it had culminated in Caligula. 
Scratch that, too then. 
\ nd then he had it. The clue, 
the thread, was of course the 
hill men. They resisted the Panechruse, did they? And they worshipped John Hillary Dane, didn’t 
they? How much better would 
they do against their city brethren 
with a god to lead them — a god 
who could produce an occasional 
battlefield miracle when one was 
most needed? And, on the everyday level . no, no gunpowder, 
but perhaps something like a 
steam cannon with rifled barrels? 
And, some mildly sophisticated 
propaganda to stir disaffection in 
the cities? The Ranidae ought to 
be suckers for atrocity stories 
a la 1914; and contrariwise, 
though there would be deaths, 
propaganda could make sure everyone on both sides knew what 
he was dying for. Injuries? Well, 
he could start with a benevolent 
miracle: He would give both 
sides the secret anesthetics . * . 
What an opportunity not to 
repeat the mistakes of the past! 
130 
The ideas were coming in swarms 
now; but after taking a few more 
notes, Dane pushed the new notions aside. The main problem 
here was not essentially technical; it was the problem of organizing and welding together the 
hill tribes, about which he knew 
very little more than that they 
existed and that the Panechruse 
hadn’t been able to recruit them. 
Taking the pressure suit out 
of its locker again, Dane prepared 
for an unscheduled apparition. 
While he was climbing into the 
suit, another technicality occurred to him, willy-nilly: The hillmen did not entirely share the 
Esperanto of the cities. This 
showed particularly in their 
names, as he had found in his 
earliest conversations with the 
two guards; both tribesmen had 
had identified themselves with 
chains of clicks, gargles and umlauts which Dane could never 
learn to handle convincingly. 
But that was surely only a 
technicality and nothing more. 
All messiahs re-named their converts, as a symbol of their conversion. And while he was at it, 
why not make the new names 
easy for the computer, too? 
In fact, never mind names at 
all. He would give numbers.

BY WILLY LEY 
THE ISLAND 
OF BRAZIL 
Tn July 1498 Ruy Gonzalez de 
Puebla, tKe Spanisli ambassador in London, wrote a routine 
report to Eis king wKicH contained tfie sentence: “tHe EnglisH 
king sent five armed vessels under a Genoese (like Columbus) 
to find tfie island of Brazil and 
tKe seven-city isle; it is said tfiat 
tEey Have been provisioned for 
one year.” 
The sentence refers to the expedition of Giovanni Cabotto — 
later John Cabot — to Labrador. 
It is also an inadvertent masterpiece of careless reporting. In the 
first place Cabotto was not from 
Genoa but was always referred to 
as a Venetian, though probably 
bom in Chioggia, some distance 
from Venice. King Henry VII of 
England had issued a patent to 
Cabotto empowering him to use 
as many ships as he deemed necessary; Cabotto sailed in the 
Mathew. No specific objectives 
were mentioned in the king’s 
edict; it just said that he should 
try “to find and to annex islands 
inhabited by heathens or infidels!” Henry VII had no intention of getting into trouble with 
the other Christian kings. Moreover, Cabotto had already returned when the diligent ambassador wrote his report; the whole 
voyage had lasted for only three 
months. 
Which leaves the question of 
what the ambassador meant by 
the “island of Brazil” and the 
seven-city isle. 
Both were invented islands, 
resting on an uncertain foundation of legend, hearsay and misunderstanding. For some reason 
the cartographers of the period 
from 1300 to 1500 were convinced 
that the Atlantic Ocean must be 
full of small islands. One of them 
asserted that “there are more 
132 
than 150 islands in the sea, each 
larger than Ireland,” while another one arrived at the figure 
of 357 undiscovered islands. 
In reality, as any schoolboy 
now knows, the Atlantic Ocean is 
rather devoid of islands until we 
get to the Caribbean Sea. At the 
eastern end, that is near the west 
coast of northern Africa, there 
are just four islands — or rather 
groups of them. The southernmost, discovered in 1456 by Alvise de Cadamosto, is the group 
of tire Cape Verde islands, to 
the west of the city of Dakar 
which, of course, did not exist 
then. Their location is about 15° 
North and 25° West. Farther to 
the north, and closer to the African mainland, we have the Canary Islands at about 28° North 
and 14 to 18° West. Then there 
is Madeira somewhat farther to 
the north and a little farther 
from the mainland at about 33° 
North and 17° West, roughly 
West, roughly west of Casablanca. Finally we have the Azores, 
about west of Lisbon, under 25° 
West and 37 to 38° North. They 
are the island group farthest out 
and then there is only open ocean 
until you reach Bermuda. 
T he Phoenicians knew about 
Madeira and the Canary Islands as early as about 900 B.C. 
They do not seem to have reached the Cape Verde islands; and 
the Azores, being farthest out 
were not discovered — half a dozen spurious stories to the contrary 
— until Portuguese sailors reached them in 1432. Later it turned 
out, however, that one Phoenician 
ship must have reached them, 
probably much against the will 
of its captain. The proof consists 
of a clay vessel, broken when 
found, containing a number of 
Phoenician coins, a few of them 
gold, most of them copper. However, these were coins that had 
been made later than 400 B.C., 
a time where the news of the existence of these islands should 
have become known in southern 
Europe, it the captain and crew 
of that vessel Had returned. 
Now, having Had a quick rundown of the actual islands in the 
Atlantic, let us return to tKe fabulous islands, especially the two 
mentioned by the Spanish ambassador. 
THe story of the seven-city island is short and uncertain; the 
story of the “island of Brazil” 
is both longer and more complicated and, at any event, more interesting. 
The “seven-city island” made 
its first appearance as an island 
or a peninsula of or near Morocco, and it was called insula ad 
septem tratres, the island of seven brothers. The “seven brotHers” 
were seven actual or invented 
mountains. But in northern EurFOR YOUR INFORMATION 
ope the term septem fratre s was 
read to mean “seven friars,” and 
then a slow transformation began. First the seven friars were 
elevated in rank to be seven bishops. And then every bishop 
founded a city; an island that 
can support seven cities evidently had to be a fairly large island. 
So it acquired seven bays, one 
for each city. Some “geographers” 
then began to speculate whether 
the seven-city island might not 
be the large and fruitful “Island 
Antiilia” that also was supposed 
to be out there in the ocean somewhere; and as time went on the 
two became more or less the 
same. I said more or less because 
some cartographers, who just 
could not Have enough islands in 
the Atlantic, kept insisting that 
the seven-city island and Antilla 
were not the same and that Antiilia was the bigger and richer 
one. x ) 
The island of Brazil, as has already been said, Has a much longer story and it was a very popular island with cartographers for 
a time; a patient historian Has 
found it on no less than 26 different maps drawn during the period 
from 1351 to 1571. On some of 
these maps there are two islands 
named Brazil , and one of them 
1) The Antilles on our maps were so named 
to comemmorate the existing name and it is 
reasonably certain that the suggestion to do 
so came from Christopher Columbus. 
even has three, carefully labeled 
Brazilia superior , Brazilia media 
and Brazilia inferior. 
Qometimes, when one is con^ fronted with such a problem, 
it helps to trace the origin of the 
name. Where does it appear first? 
And what does it mean, just considered as a word? Well, the name 
appears first on a map drawn in 
1330 by Angelino Dalorto; it is 
located in the general vicinity of 
Ireland and bears the the inscription: Insule de montonis sive de 
brazile. This is Latin, of course, 
and anybody who does not know 
Latin is likely to think that this 
should be easy to read. It isn’t. 
The words de montonis have no 
meaning at all; and, brazile is, at 
best, of very uncertain meaning. 
It was Fridtjof Nansen, the Norwegian explorer, who thought of 
a possibility. Nansen had, of 
course, read everything he could 
find about earlier exploration of 
northern waters. Much of what 
looked at first glance like straight 
reporting turned out to be legendary, and in 1911 he wrote a 
book about accounts he knew or 
suspected to be fiction. 2 ) 
He recognized the word brazile 
to be Gaelic, originally Hy Breasail (also appearing as O’Brazil, 
2) The original title is Nord i taakeheimen; the German translation, published in 
the same year, has the title Nebelheim ; 
there is no English translation. 
meaning “happy island”) and 
wondered whether the montonis 
might not be the French mouton, 
meaning sheep. The traditional 
“sheep islands” in the north are 
the Faeroe, so that the derivation 
from mouton was not at all unreasonable. Why Angelino Dalorto who was, of course, an Italian, combined the sheep islands 
with “brazil” he explained himself 
in a roundabout way, namely by 
stating that the wool of these 
sheep can be beautifully dyed. 
Don’t say that this statement 
doesn’t explain anything; we’ll 
get to that point in a little while. 
First we have to become acquainted with Nansen’s story of 
O’Brazil. 
On the western coast of 
Ireland atmospheric reflections 
are fairly common at certain 
times of the year and nobody 
can be blamed for thinking that 
a distant island has become visible temporarily. On the other 
hand the Irish sailors and fishermen knew that there were no important islands even a long distance off shore, so the islands 
had to be ghostly islands; as a 
kind of redeeming feature it was 
said that these islands were inhabited by beautiful women. 
More, if one succeeded in shooting an arrow to the island or in 
throwing a piece of iron across, 
this act would make the island 
“fast,” so that one could reach 
it. But the few young men who 
did succeed never returned. 
At a much later date the Irish 
poet Gerald Griffin (1803-1840) 
condensed the legend into an 
eight-line poem, O’ Brazil, the Island of the Blest, that was published in London in 1843 and 
which reads 
On the ocean that hollows the Rocks 
where ye dwell, 
A shadowy land has appeared, as they 
tell. 
Men thought it a region of sunshine 
and rest. 
And they call it O'Brazil — the isle of 
the blest. 
From year unto year, on the ocean's 
blue rim. 
The beautiful spectre showed lovely and 
dim; 
The golden clouds curtained the deep, 
where it lay. 
And it looked like an Eden, away, far 
away. 
If Angelino Dalorto had known 
the full story of O’Brazil he would 
not have made the mistake he 
did make. But apparently he only heard the name, and to him 
“brazil” was not a name, it was 
a word, meaning “fiery red.” But 
he did not think of some finished 
article of a fiery red color; he 
thought of the dyestuff that went 
by this name and the dyestuff, in 
turn, was connected in his mind 
with islands in the Atlantic 
Ocean. 
A nd that is the other half of the 
** story, beginning in antiquity. 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
The ancients were fond of color in their gowns, but dyes, especially red dyes, were hard to come 
by. A garment dyed “Tyrian purple” was expensive, just because 
it had been dyed that color — 
incidentally the “purple” in that 
term is not the color we call by 
this name, but it means a very 
bright red. One source was a marine snail of the Mediterranean 
region, called Purpura haemostoma by zoologists. The snail 
produced a fine dye, but only one 
small drop per snail, hence the 
high price. 
Only a few decades before 
Christ, the energetic and highly 
learned King Juba II of Mauritania started what can only be called dye-works on the Canary Islands. He reported that his men 
found the islands uninhabited 
but that in places there were ruins 
of old buildings; a statement that 
goes well with the assumption of 
Phoenician settlements on those 
islands several centuries earlier. 
The dye factories of King Juba 
became proverbial that Pling the 
Elder referred to the Canaries 
by the name of Purpurariae, the 
purple islands. 
Pliny did not say, or did not 
know what the dyers of King 
Juba used in their places in 
the Canaries; and a book on 
animals and plants, written 
by Juba himself, has unfortunately not been preserved. 
But thirteen hundred years later 
it was no longer the secret that 
it might have been at the time of 
Pliny. Both on the Canary Islands and on the not-yet-discovered Azores there grows a lichen 
which furnishes a fine red dye. 
Its botanical name is Roccella 
tinctoria; it is generally known 
under its French name of orseille 
and it was called the Herb Orisello by Alvise de Cadamosto. 
To all Europeans who were at 
all interested in things of Nature, 
the presence of large quantities 
of orseille on most of these islands created the impression that 
Atlantic islands and dyes belonged together. In the meantime, 
however, another red dye had 
been found on the European 
mainland itself. It is mentioned 
in a document for the first time 
in 1194 when the two cities of 
Bologna and Ferrara made a 
treaty which regulated, among 
other things, their commerce in 
grana de brasile, a term that, in 
this connection, is best translated 
as “fireberries.” Of course they 
were not berries, they were the 
galls that form on the leaves of 
the oak Quercus coccifera, caused 
by the infection with an insect 
parasite that has received the 
fitting name of Coccus infectorius. 
This was the “brazile,” the red 
dye, that Dalorto had in mind 
when he labeled an island on his 
map with the misleading descrip136 
tion that mixed up sheep and brazil dye. While others did not mix 
sheep and dye, they did mix islands and dye. The mysterious 
Island of Brazil, if anybody succeeded in discovering it, would 
be easy to recognize, for it would 
surely be the home of plentiful 
quantities of Cadamosto’s Herb 
Orisello. 
Hphen the Azores were discover -®- ed, and at the foot of the 
mountain, that was the characteristic of one of the islands, orseille 
was found to grow in quantity. 
The mountain was quickly christened Morro do Brazil, while the 
island received the name of Terceira. Carless historians later 
made the mistake by saying that 
there can be no doubt about the 
identity of the Island of Brazil 
and the actual island Terceira. 
You can find this statement even 
now in a well reputed large encyclopedia. The assertion is nonsense for the very simple reason 
that the Irish O’Brazil was not 
an actual island and therefore 
could not refer to the unknown 
Azores. Moreover, O’Brazil was 
“seen” to the west of Ireland and 
the Azores are to the west of 
Portugal. 
The whole confusion is due to 
the single fact that the Gaelic 
word happened to sound like the 
Old Italian word for a certain 
color. 
But if this is so, how about the 
name Brazil on our maps? 
It actually is named after another red dye. 
The Portuguese who discovered 
it first called the area Terra de 
Vera Cruz; it was around the year 
1510 that the name began to 
change to Terra de Brazil, for 
soon after its discovery it turned 
out that enormous numbers of 
“dye-wood trees” happened to 
grow there. Botanically these 
trees belonged to the genus Caesalpinia, other species of which 
can be found elsewhere on earth 
in a sufficiently warm climate. 
How important this discovery 
was to the Europeans of the early 
sixteenth century can be deduced 
from, a financial transaction that 
took place in 1500. A very enterprising Italian merchant by the 
name of Fernando della Rogna 
who, we don’t know how, had investigated and appraised the situation, made an agreement with 
the king of Portugal. Fernando 
della Rogna acquired a monoply 
on the dyewood trees of Terra 
de Vera Cruz in consideration of 
an annual payment of 4000 
pieces of gold to the Royal Treasury. Apparently the agreement 
worked out well; at any event a 
small island off the coast of 
Brazil, discovered either by della 
Rogna or by one of his captains, 
was named Fernando Noronha, 
the Portuguese version of his 
FOR YOUR INFORMATION 
name. It bears this name to this 
day. 
The fact that Brazil, ‘our’ Brazil, still appeared as a large island on maps of the sixteenth 
century has nothing to do with 
the O’Brazil-red-dye confusion. 
The American double continent 
was discovered piecemeal and 
the fact that there was a continuous coastline from Labrador 
to Brazil was simply not known. 
Hence Labrador, Florida and 
Brazil first appeared as large 
islands on the maps; there was 
no indication yet that they were 
portions of the same continent. 
In fact, since the original goal 
of the explorers had been to reach 
China, most captains and their 
sponsors rather preferred the idea 
that all these newly discovered 
lands were large islands, useful in 
themselves but with passages to 
China between them. 
Martin Sch'ongauer’s 
Dragontree 
D yes, as the story of the island 
of Brazil has shown, were 
something that pre-occupied the 
commercial instincts of both the 
ancients and the people of the 
Middle Ages. 
There was one more source for 
a red dye, one that has not yet 
been mentioned. It was “dragon’s 
blood,” a dramatically named 
substance that was the gum of a 
tree called the dragontree. Dragon’s blood, the nature of which 
was perfectly well known, came 
mainly from the ‘island of Dioscorides’, the island of Sokotra 
near the mouth of the Gulf of 
Aden, situated under 12° -North 
and 54° East. A closely related 
species grows along the Somali 
coast of the African mainland 
and still another species grows in 
places along the African west 
coast. The dragontree, like the 
equally weird-looking Joshua 
tree of our western deserts, belongs to the Lilly family, which, 
of course, was not known then. 
The red gum, from 1500 to 
about 1800, was often prescribed 
as a remedy for toothaches, presumably following the motto: 
when desperate, try anything! It 
also served, and much better, 
as a source for a red' dye, though 
the dye was not as good as that 
from orseille. 
When the Portuguese rediscovered the Canary islands and 
Madeira, they saw that the dragontree grew on these islands, too. 
In about 1455 Alvise de Cadamosto carefully described a dragontree he had found on the small 
island of Porto Santo near Madeira. More than a hundred years 
later the dragontree was described for the first time in a botanical work the “Spanish Herbarium” of Carolus Clusius, published in Antwerp in 1576. Clu
138 
sius had seen a dragontree Himself in 1564, growing near the wall 
of a monastery in Lisbon, but 
said that Cadamosto should be 
considered the discoverer of that 
tree. Carolus Linnaeus later 
named it Dracaena draco. 
There is a somewhat earlier 
reference to dragontrees growing 
near Lisbon — they had evidently been transplanted either from 
the Canaries or from Madeira — 
by Dr. Hieronymus Muenzer. He 
saw three specimens in 1494 and 
said that one of them was large; 
the other two, it might be presumed, were still small. 
There is an intriguing mystery 
about the dragontree: it was carefully and correctly drawn about 
thirty years before Dr. Muenzer saw it by an artist who, according to all existing historical 
sources, could not possibly have 
seen one. The artist’s name was 
Martin Schongauer. His father, 
a goldsmith, had been a native of 
the city of Augsburg in Germany, 
but at one time in his life had decided to move eastward in the 
wake of the Teutonic Knights 
and had settled in the small city 
of Kolmar, in what later came 
to be called West Prussia.(Kolmar is now just inside the Polish 
border.) The artist was bom in 
Kolmar in about 1450 and, as 
the available sources say, lived 
there all his life, except for short 
journeys to nearby towns. 
A round tHe year 1470, when he 
was still a young man, he 
composed his “Flight to Egypt,” 
based on the well known Biblical 
story. It shows Joseph and Mary 
with the infant Jesus in an oasis; 
Joseph is gathering fruit, assisted 
by the angel. The largest tree in 
the picture, placed conspicuously in the foreground, shows a 
dragontree. It is so well drawn 
that botanists could say that the 
tree was about 50 years old. 
How could Schongauer have 
done this? There are no earlier 
pictures of that tree and for a 
long time Schongauer’s was the 
only one, as is proved by two imitations. Albrecht Duerer’s “Flight 
to Egypt” — around 1515 — is 
frankly based on Schongauer’s 
picture, though parts of the tree 
are concealed by clouds. The other imitation is a painting, known 
to have been done in 1518 in 
Augsburg by one H. Burgkmair. 
Burkgmair called his painting 
“St. John on Patmos” and it is a 
rather fantastic picture; but 
Schongauer’s dragontree is there, 
not as good as the original, but 
still recognizable. 
It is unfortunate that Dr. 
Muenzer did not give the size 
of the “large” tree he saw in 1494, 
because, when it comes to dragontrees, the word large is a flexible term. The trees grow to a 
very old age — one that died in 
1868 on Tenerife was believed by 
FOR YOUR INFORAAATION 
the local inhabitants to have been 
5000 years old, though botanists 
would not grant more than 3000 
years — and' it seems to grow 
for as long as it lives. If Dr. 
Muenzer, as can be assumed, 
compared the tree he saw to trees 
in fruit orchards, a 75-year-old 
dragontree would look large. The 
same tree would then have been 
about 50 years old by the time 
Schongauer drew it. 
But Schongauer is supposed to 
have stayed in the area of Kolmar all his life. This assertion 
can be accepted if it refers to 
his adult life. As a young man 
he must have traveled and in his 
travels he must have reached 
Lisbon, the only place on the 
European mainland where one 
could see a living dragontree.

The world was too complicated for 
people to understand. So they had 
the National Emergency and insane 
space maneuvering — and Mr. Smith. 
I 
A t first Kendy guessed tlie Russians were as paranoid as 
Americans. Ttieir armor of systematized delusions as to the nature 
of tlie universe Had been pene
trated by something. So they were 
up tight. 
Their Lotka II had attached 
herself to Phobos as planned, but 
her landing module never did 
spiral down to the fascinating 
surface of Mars. Although E. Va
vilov was a biochemist, all three 
silvery modules of Lotka remained clinging together and to that 
lifeless moonlet. Whenever Phobos whirled from behind Mars, 
coded lasergrams flickered. 
After official secrecy so dense 
it seemed to be shielding ideological confusion, Moscow announced there had been a minor 
technical difficulty. Lotka returned all three men to Earth’. 
But there was no interview with 
E. Vavilov. 
Kendy was young enough to 
be momentarily interested, but at 
sixteen his personal universe was 
small. He couldn’t feel that something so distant would have anything to do with him. He wanted 
to be a basketball coach. Sometimes he wanted to be a biochemist. Occasionally he thought he 
wanted to become a statesman. 
He felt fragmented. His friends 
smoked grass. He felt saddled by 
contradictions. He smiled at his 
teachers because he wanted to 
like them. His thoughts galloped 
awkwardly, shying away from the 
big cliffs of life. He wanted to 
wave his arms but kept his hands 
in his pockets and talked like a 
slob. He and his friends were 
growing up during the anti-intellectualism which grew with the 
National Emergency. 
Kendy had been bom into the 
usual world of paranoids. In the 
delivery room of the hospital, his 
KENDY'S WORLD 
gasping young mother hoped he’d 
become the groovy swinger his father wasn’t. His pale father more 
conveniently had hoped this smiling little ape-face would become 
President of the United States. 
T Tis father didn’t live that long. 
His skull was shattered by 
a stray bullet the day the National Emergency was declared. Kendy had been seven then, but all 
he could remember now was 
smoke spreading from downtown 
Los Angeles. He couldn’t remember crying. Although he had been 
seven when his father was alive, 
he couldn’t remember his father’s 
voice. He knew his father had 
been a case-worker for the Walfare Department, because his 
mother told him so. He couldn’t 
remember the feeling of his father’s hand on his shoulder. 
Clutching the photo album, he 
would stare at his father’s two-dimensional face. Under the magnifying glass, his father’s face within the glossy photographs disintegrated into blotches and 
specks. It was as if hfe father were 
hiding from him. 
Or he was hiding from his father. As if he were too small to 
accept the burden, he didn’t want 
to understand who or what had 
killed his father, whose innocent 
and unobtrusive name had been 
Olson. The Los Angeles Telephone Directories contained the 
names of thousands of living fathers named Olson. His mother 
explained, but he couldn’t understand why his father was the one 
to die. “He was very sentimental 
and idealistic,” she rambled. “I 
guess I was sort of — what they 
called — a hippy. When we 
brought you Home from the hospital, I started calling you Ken 
for short. Your father sort of 
laughed and said: ‘Sounds too 
much like those damn Ken and 
Barbie dolls. His first name is 
Ken-ne-dy. We named him Kennedy. We’ll call him Kennedy. He 
will be proud of it!’ ” 
In kindergarten, other kids 
couldn’t pronounce it. They slurred it. Kendy could remember all 
the way back to kindergarten, 
though he couldn’t remember his 
father. Joyfully he Had led the 
other children up and down on 
the chairs until the teacher argued that it was rest time. 
Sprawled on his rest-mat, he 
should have kept his eyes shut, 
but he tried to read the Los Angeles Times. He was matching 
the letters M.O.L. with its picture when the teacher’s weak 
voice shifted from reprimand to 
sing-song ridicule. To his surprise, all the other children began to sing with Her: “Kendy 
reads a noisy newspaper, Kendy 
reads a noisy newspaper.” 
Hastily He’d folded the terribly 
loud newspaper. He’d closed his 
142 
eyes. At that moment Kendy 
learned fear that no one would 
like Him any more. Soon he learned to get a Gold Star for cooperation in school. 
B y the time Kendy was sixteen, 
the National Emergency had 
been in effect for nine years, and 
He barely noticed it because he’d 
grown up within it. As a gangling 
six-footer with floppy brownish 
Hair, He stood in contrast to his 
plump mother whose Hair was 
raven-black. He did inherit her 
prominent cheekbones, so that he 
seemed to be squinting out at the 
world. He smiled so much, in contrast to the cool expressions of 
his classmates, that they’d always 
been attracted to him. 
The year before he’d been elected sophomore class president. 
Now he was the hard-working 
member of the student council. 
He was the hustler on the junior 
varsity basketball team, bounding downcourt like a grasshopper. 
He couldn’t Help laughing 
whenever he realized his life wag 
a put-on. By letting his grades 
slump and becoming more popular with the kids than with the 
teachers, he managed to become 
one of the nominees for next 
year’s student body presidency. 
He surprised everyone by presenting a political platform as if 
it were a real election concerned 
with real power. His number one 
plank was yearly grading of the 
teachers by their students. This 
hopefully constructive criticism 
would have to be conducted and 
tabulated off-campus. He began 
to worry that he might be elected. 
When He took a moment to 
glance at the television news, Soviet space efforts had been redirected to Earth’s garbage-strewn 
Moon. In a startling retreat from 
their Pliobos-Mars cop-out, they 
were conducting a massive re-exploration of the Moon. Soviet 
crawlers searched its maria and 
craters so intensively they seemed 
insane. They even uprooted the 
old U.S. base. Nothing on the 
Moon could be worth as much 
as the search was costing. 
Concurrently, in West Virginia, 
Tin Woodman was dynamited by 
persons unknown. Kendy had 
read that Tin Woodman, growing 
tall beside Ozma II, was considered a menace by paranoids of various political persuasions. They 
were afraid that Something Out 
There might hear Tin Woodman’s radio shouts to the universe. 
Kendy felt both relieved and 
angered when notified he’d just 
lost the school election — - by 
three stinking votes. Loping down 
the long concrete steps from the 
campus, he wished he could escape from high school. Ahead of 
him for next September, his seKENDY'S WORLD 
nior year now crystal-balled as a 
drag. He doubted he could make 
the varsity basketball team. He 
might try to be elected president 
of the Biochem Club, and he’d 
have to resuscitate his grades before the college recruiters returned. 
Qquinting against the June sun^ light, he smiled, and the 
anomaly of his fair skin and high 
Asian cheekbones might have 
made an ethnologist shrug or 
jokingly classify him as Siberisk, 
a Soviet citizen from the Siberian 
racial melting pot. 
He was in the world pot. His 
future was so immensely appalling, like the future of any boy 
then growing into manhood, that 
its recapitulation involved a series of amputations in order to 
examine the vital sequences of 
his life. 
“How-’d the election come out?” 
Mr. Smith was such a jovial giant standing outside the high 
school’s chain-link fence that he 
resembled a college basketball 
coach on a recruiting expedition. 
“Down the tubes,” Kendy retorted, not afraid to sound a little disrespectful; Mr. Smith had 
been taking him to lunch all 
week until today. 
“I’ll wear a black armband,” 
Mr. Smith laughed unexpectedly, 
and he glanced down at his brown 
shoes, which were peculiarly 
small and short for such a huge 
man. “Seriously, I heard you lost 
by only three votes.” 
“Then why’d you ask me how 
it came out?” Kendy blurted. 
“The count hasn’t even been announced yet except to me and 
Steve.” 
“I was anxious.” Mr. Smith 
grinned, tautening his incipient 
jowls, until he appeared to be a 
well-conditioned forty-five. 
“For me to lose?” Kendy knew 
why that was true. 
“Ken - Kendy, I’ve been trying too hard to impress you.” 
His smile became so uncertain 
he could Have passed for a dissipated thirty-five. Then he became so enthusiastic it seemed as 
if a slimmer man of twenty-five 
were peeking out. “Since you’ve 
lost, since you’re cutting afternoon classes anyway, fly up with 
me past San Luis Obispo right 
now for a grand tour. Why wait 
till next year?” 
Kendy laughed, trying not to 
seem embarrassed. “You guys — 
recruiting kids before they even 
finish eleventh grade — ” 
I t didn’t seem ethical. Kendy 
had taken the Scholastic Aptitude Tests simply as practice 
for next year when he would take 
them again as a senior. To his 
surprise, nineteen Universities 
had contacted him prematurely. 
Academic recruiters slipped him 
144 
glossy promotional booklets and 
advised him to stay clean until 
next year when he was a senior 
and could sign a Letter of Intent. 
The reason good students 
were being more actively recruited than athletes was Senate Bill 
30-06, passed the year the National Emergency began. It offered double tuition subsidies to 
any approved university for each 
student it recruited whose S.A.T. 
scores were at least 500 in English and above 650 in Math'. The 
Senators had added other requirements. Approved recruits must 
be patriotic high school graduates. 
“I won’t Have enough units to 
get my high school diploma until 
next June,” Kendy said. • 
“That makes us a better choice 
than Harvard,” Mr. Smith 
laughed. “We want you now.” 
Kendy had heard that this new 
National University north of San 
Luis Obispo wasn’t dependent on 
the emergency education legislation. It had its own unlimited 
government funding. It could set 
its own entrance criteria. 
“I’ve lost the election,” Kendy 
said. “Why do you — do you 
still want me?” He didn’t know if 
he wanted National University. 
The U.C.L.A. recruiter had 
knocked N.U. even worse than 
U.S.C. His high school counsellor had warned him that enrolling 
at National University was like 
making a deal with the devil but 
then weakened his argument by 
pushing his own alma mater,, 
Fresno State. The National Television Station commentators all 
said National University had 
outstanding educational innovations. 
Mr. Smith rested his graygloved hand on Kendy’s shoulder. “Some fancy universities 
really try to collect nothing but 
high school student-body presidents. But I kid you not, we 
just want guys we like.” 
Corn-ball, Kendy thought, but 
surprised himself by smiling with 
pleasure, liking Mr. Smith better 
and better. 
The gray glove pressing on 
Kendy’s shoulder had seemed 
smooth but its weight began to 
transmit a bumpy feeling, Kendy 
thought, as if Mr. Smith’s fingers were nothing but bones. Yesterday, when Mr. Smith took him 
to lunch, Kendy had felt uncomfortable watching Mr. Smith’ 
munching a cheeseburger while 
wearing gloves. But Mr. Smith 
wore such a groovy next-year’s 
sport coat with a long Edwardian 
tail that Kendy knew he must be 
a smooth operator, in spite of forgetting to remove his gloves when 
he ate. 
6 6 Qay the word, Kendy, and we 
^ will take a taxi to the jet 
pad.” 
KENDY'S WORLD 
“Sir, I’ve got to be honest with 
you.” Kendy blurted. “You’d better recruit some senior. My mother would never sign the waiver 
to let me skip my last year of 
high school. She hates ■ — ” 
“She’ll fly up with us.” 
“You’re kidding.” Kendy knew 
his mother would refuse to visit 
that campus; last night she’d put 
another underground magazine on 
his pillow, and it roasted National University even worse than 
West Point. 
“This noon I took her to lunch 
at the Hilton,” Mr. Smith explained. 
“Are you putting me on?” 
“Say the word, and I’ll hustle 
back to the May Company and 
fix it with her supervisor so she 
can take the rest of the afternoon 
off and we’ll go.” Mr. Smith was 
talking as excitedly as if he were 
twenty-five again. “What department is she in?” 
“Complaint Department.” 
Kendy thought Mr. Smith was 
over-confident. He couldn’t understand Mr. Smith. He could 
understand the surface of his 
words. Mr. Smith talked as bluntly as a fellow slob. Sometimes 
Mr. Smith would switch, mouthing long and well-organized sentences. Probably these were part 
of the recruiting spiel he’d rehearsed. They didn’t necessarily 
indicate intelligence. But at other 
times, while kidding around, Mr. 
Smitfi Ead wised-off so shrewdly 
that Kendy thought this huge 
man might be able to speak from 
a great depth of experience and 
emotion if the surface of his life 
hadn’t confined him to being a 
slob. 
It was as if the man were fragmented within his shell. When he 
smiled, Ee seemed youthful. When 
he looked away in a moment of 
disinterest, Eis face sagged and 
Ee seemed old, as if staring at 
deatH. Suddenly He’d grin at 
Kendy and become young again. 
When he laughed, he gave Kendy 
a feeling of warmth" and reflected 
strength. 
But then Mr. Smith would say 
something slobby, and Kendy 
could feel tlie uncertainty, as if 
he were recruiting in a world he 
couldn’t quite believe. Kendy 
wasn’t repelled by this. He felt 
the same way — fragmented. 
At Home his mother talked like 
a slob but occasionally astonished 
him with her bitter wit. She seemed to be tEe only person who remembered what life was like before the National Emergency. At 
school, Eis friends, were slobs, 
half-heartedly rebelling as if they 
didn’t know which way to go. 
Kendy’s counsellor occasionally 
would pause while berating him 
for not trying harder scholastically and switch to praise. During 
those glowing moments of hope, 
even though Kendy knew the 
146 
counsellor was shoveling child 
psychology on him like manure, 
Kendy could' feel himself growing. His fragments were coalescing. It was possible for him to 
become clear-thinking, subtle, 
strong and purposeful. In those 
moments he knew his father 
couldn’t have been a slob. 
II 
A t 2:32 tEe copter Howled upward through the smog with 
Mr. Smith sitting next to Kendy’s 
mother and shouting: “National 
University’s a whole new concept 
in American education.” 
His mother’s wide face seemed 
flushed with excitement In the 
roaring draft from the ventilator, 
Eer crow-black hair lashed her 
cheekbone. Kendy wondered if 
Mr. Smith Ead researched their 
background so thoroughly that 
Ee knew she was one-quarter 
Mescalero Apache and that after 
only one semester at U.C.L.A. 
she’d married a skinny blondbearded MinneswedisH sociology 
student and given birth to Kendy. 
“Only three of us in this big 
Helicopter?” she shouted. 
Mr. Smith had issued them: 
tight head-sets, but she shouted 
as if she didn’t believe her cordless intercom was working : “Only 
three?” 
“Holds .fourteen,” Mr. Smith 
answered proudly. “This is the 
newest Cheyennette,” he continued innocently “Fourteen seats in 
our passenger capsule. Comfortable?” 
Kendy winced. He knew what 
was coming. She had a caustic 
tongue. 
“I thought this so-called Coalition Congress,” she shouted, 
“was hanging on for nine years or 
ninety-nine — to save money! A 
dollar saved means a policeman’s 
paid. Let the poor pay for the 
war. I thought one of the reasons for continuing the National 
Emergency was economy in government transportation.” 
To this sarcastic shaft, Mr. 
Smith merely explained, “The 
copter had to go back to National 
University anyway.” 
Kendy looked away. If his 
mother kept making subversive 
remarks against the Coalition 
Congress, he thought he might 
not be admitted to any university 
which was receiving a government 
subsidy, as they all were. 
“The diplomats of the future,” 
Mr. Smith said hopefully, “will 
Have got their starts at National University.” 
“Kendy’s had a nice offer from 
Harvard,” she shouted, “for next 
year — when he’s ready.” 
fT'mbarrassed, Kendy peered 
■*— 1 ' out of his greasy window. 
He watched the stub-winged 
shadow of their copter slide across 
KENDY'S WORLD 
Santa Monica Bay and shrink 
as the Cheyennette rose. With its 
rotor blades clattering, the winged copter leveled off and began 
to accelerate like an airplane. 
Kendy supposed its rotor was 
free-wheeling now. Its tail-propellor was pushing them so fast 
that the stubby wings were surfboarding on the air. 
Below, along the long curve of 
Malibu Beach, the surf wrinkled and whitened. On the other 
side, past Mr. Smith’s head, Kendy glimpsed the distant purple 
hulk of Catalina Island. Mr. 
Smith winked at him. Kendy 
Hoped they were still friends. The 
winged copter buffeted northward 
above the Santa Barbara Channel, and the oil drilling platforms 
made Kendy think of spiders 
standing in the greenish summer water. The Cheyennette 
whined like a mosquito with its 
course paralleling the islands of 
the National Park. Those protruded like jagged windbreaks, already summer-brown. The northernmost island glared white with 
engulfing sand, and Kendy noticed the rows of black spots there 
on San Miguel Island, probably 
barracks of the old Emergency 
Dentention Camp. When his 
mother didn’t seem to notice 
them, he relaxed. She was quieter than He’d expected. 
The Cheyennette was swaying 
like a boat. Ahead, the greenish 
water of the Channel was streaked by an arctic blue current. 
Wind from the north stretched 
out the whitecaps. Kendy knew 
the dark outcurve of the mainland must be Point Concepcion 
where the marine ecology became 
North Pacific. Surf bearded the 
cliffs of Point Arguello. Up on 
the brown hills, rows of excavations into the underlying chalk 
reminded Kendy of more whitecaps. In their white arches he 
saw radar dishes and unrecognizable apparatus. They would be 
aimed during M.O.L. launches. 
With manned synchronous satellites hovering over a lot of places 
besides Moscow and Washington, 
he guessed the jokes about what 
girls did when they bathed in 
the nude might be true. 
“We’re almost there,” Mr. 
Smith’s voice announced, and 
Kendy guessed this premature 
statement was supposed to keep 
them from becoming restless ; 
they hadn’t even passed Vandenberg Air Force Base yet. 
/"y ver the dry mouth of the Santa Ynez River, Kendy watched a long freight train flowing 
across the bridge. The train 
wormed north past pencil-sized 
Minute Man VII’s standing at 
attention for testing. Kendy saw 
the shadow of a missile so enormous he wondered if it would 
be another attempt. 
US 
“ — of us,” Mr. Smith was saying in their earphones. “Not because their intelligence operations 
were any better than ours. The 
real reason is that way back before the Emergency our space appropriations were too small.” 
“When I was a girl, we always 
blamed the spies,” her voice replied dryly as the freight train 
crawled past a concrete blockhouse. 
“That was atoms, not rockets,” 
Kendy blurted in embarrassment 
at her stupidity. 
Looking down, He remembered 
viewing an old tape in American 
History about the days when 
trains still carried passengers. 
Along this same track, tjie Southern Pacific Daylight had rushed 
a Premier Krush-off-or-shev-orsomething toward San Francisco. 
While that old passenger train 
hurried through Vandenberg Air 
Force Base, porters had scurried 
to pull down the blinds in his car. 
“For some reason they’re crawling all over the Moon again,” Mr. 
Smith was saying. 
“Why worry about them when 
it’s us we should be worrying 
about?” she protested as if trying to impress some great lesson 
on Kendy. 
But Kendy remembered how 
intensely she’d watched the Telstar broadcast the day the Russians sent those three men almost to Mars. They’d seemed so 
confident. That grinning biochemist named E. Vavilov had recited what he expected to find on 
Mars. On the television screen, 
he Had seemed surprisingly young 
for a Nobel Prize winner. His 
high cheekbones made him appear somewhat Siberian. 
“He looks like someone I 
know,” Kendy’s mother had muttered. 
E. Vavilov had smiled so mischievously while proclaiming dialectical materialism as the scientific doorway to total understanding of life throughout the universe that Kendy wondered if — 
really — Vavilov wanted to wink 
at all his friendly-enemy biochemists out there in worldwide 
television land. Then he had 
winked! Or gotten something in 
his eye. Kendy had leaned forward, blinking. 
After the abortive return from 
Phobos, E. Vavilov didn’t appear 
on television again. The pilot of 
Lotka II recited their excuse 
from the teleprompter — a minor 
technical difficulty. A month later, while maintaining his skills 
or his flight pay, that pilot reportedly crashed his jet trainer. 
Pravda also announced that E. 
Vavilov had returned to his research at the Limonological Institute on Lake Baikal, where he 
was temporarily indisposed. Mars 
wasn’t mentioned. 
The Soviets began their inexKENDY'S WORLD 
plicable search of the rough surface of the Earth’s Moon. This 
seemed an advance to the rear. 
^Tphe Cheyennette skimmed 
above the sand dunes of Pismo Beach. It banked oceanward 
around the dark cliffs which protected Port Avila from the north 
wind. Out over the Pacific, around 
this immense promontory, the 
copter climbed. Kendy knew they 
must be approaching National 
University. He smiled nervously 
as he searched for it. Mr. Smith 
had mentioned that it was located 
in a canyon. This mountainous 
promontory was gashed by dozens of steep canyons down to the 
breakers. But there was no sign 
of it. 
“There’s Diablo Canyon, Pacific Gas and Electric’s nuc-electric generating plant,” Mr. Smith 
said. “National U’s so close our 
light bulbs stay lit by induction.” 
He smiled faintly at the tired 
joke. 
Kendy peered at gray-green 
chapparal slopes and afternoonshadowed canyons on this tenmile-wide bulge into the Pacific. 
“Beyond the University, in the 
next bay,” Mr. Smith 1 said enthusiastically to Kendy’s mother, “there’s Moro Rock. Our boys 
have fun assaulting — I mean, 
climbing the Rock. Of course the 
Park Service has installed safety 
fences all the way to the top, so 
it’s safe enough. Look farther 
north beyond Moro Bay. We 
could see San Simeon if it was a 
clearer day.” 
“Oh, the Hearst Castle,” Kendy’s mother said. “At least the 
people got something back from 
him when he died. Personally 
I — ” 
“Yes, it’s an historic monument,” the recruiter interrupted, 
“with llamas on the lawns. Look 
back the other way, inland. There 
is San Luis Obispo — nice little 
town of fifty thousand — and 
you can see the buildings of Cal 
Poly. Those unimaginative engineers are supposed to become 
our traditional rivals. They win 
the football games, but there’s 
no competition intellectually. In 
educational methods and in architecture, National University 
stands alone as the model for the 
future of American higher education,” he recited. “It is designed 
as an answer to the National 
Emergency, and congress has continued to be generous. We’re enlarging again this year.” 
Visually, Kendy had been 
searching unsuccessfully, for a 
canyon. Instead', he saw a vast 
shallow bowl-shaped pasture at 
the head of what must have been 
a canyon before the earth-moving 
machines began their work: Its 
bulldozed rim shimmered golden brown with wild oats. Its center was lawn-green. Then he spot150 
ted a circle of red tile roofs arranged around a central hub of 
huge roofs. Kendy blinked in surprise. Although it was 3 :30 in the 
afternoon, the buildings cast oddly short shadows. 
The circling Cheyennette jerked as its rotor re-engaged. While 
it descended, Kendy counted 
twenty tile-roofed buildings 
around the rim of the campus 
and nine more dorms under construction. Even the huge lab 
buildings and auditoriums at the 
hub were only one story high, 
which explained their short shadows. 
From each dorm building, a red 
tile path extended inward like a 
spoke to the hub buildings. Kendy couldn’t see any students. He 
kept looking for students on the 
circular path which connected the 
dorms as the copter settled down 
to a landing behind a dorm. 
Beneath the tile roof and 
shaded porches of what was supposed to be a dorm, there was a 
glint of office windows. The lobby and administrative offices 
seemed to occupy the entire 
building. Mystified, Kendy began 
to wonder whether everyone here 
was an -administrator? 
A s they walked in past Spanish 
ironwork and dented armor, 
Kendy’s mother said: “Where 
will he sleep? Not even room for 
a hundred students.” 
Kendy had told her each dorm 
was supposed to house eight hundred, or so the catalogue had said. 
Mr. Smith' laughed as if appreciating a bit of humor from Her. 
“We had the dual problem of 
conforming to historic California architecture and also to our 
country’s needs.” 
He led them to the row of elevator doors, all inscribed: 
DOWN. 
At the minus-one level, they 
walked out of the elevator into 
what resembled a miniature railroad station. An electric car Hummed in from the central Hub. Men 
scrambled off. None had beards 
or long hair, and surprisingly few 
carried books. 
Another car zipped through' on 
a cross track which formed a 
right angle with the first. Kenby 
straightened. The car left a whiff 
of perfume. 
“Well, that’s something!” Kendy’s mother said enigmatically. 
“When I was at U.C.L.A. we had 
to hike miles between classes, always hurrying and always late. 
Is this a coeducational dorm?” 
“Just passing through,” Mr. 
Smith’ answered quickly. “Their 
car is on the rim track. They’re 
just passing through to their own 
dorm. No girls allowed below 
this level.” 
“That seems — ■ stupid,” she remarked. “For a supposedly modern — ” 
KfNDY'S WORLD 
“National University was authorized by Congress to rebuild 
moral standards,” Mr. Smith hastily answered with a straight face. 
“N.U.’s goal is to help renovate 
the traditional way of life which 
made America great.’’ He grinned at Kendy. “There are some 
cute girls here.” 
'Out Kendy knew from the 
catalogue that there were 
only two women’s dorms, though 
he hadn’t given the implications of that scarcity sufficient 
thought. 
“ — - group solidarity within 
each dorm,” Mr. Smith was reciting, “and friendly supervision 
like an enlightened academy so 
that the student unrest, which 
was so prevalent in older universities before the Emergency, can’t 
happen Here.” 
“UH-Huh,” Kendy’s mother 
said, in obvious disbelief. 
“Over here,” Mr. Smith said 
hastily, “is our recreation hall.” 
The clicking ping-pong ball on 
the automatic-return table stopped. At the open end of tfi§ table, concealed nearly to the armpits, a startlingly young boy 
stared across the dark green plywood at Kendy. As if in disbelief 
or pain, the boy’s sharp features 
Screwed up, and he swallowed 
with an audible gulp. 
Kendy squinted in recognition 
and opened his mouth to speak. 
But Oliver abruptly turned his 
back. Kendy didn’t know what to 
say. He heard another gulp, even 
though Oliver’s back was turned 
and he was walking away from 
Kendy. Like a goddamn Gollum, 
Kendy thought, as Oliver hurried 
away with his big white tennis 
shoes flapping on the hardwood 
floor. When Oliver reached the 
dark doorway, his pale face 
looked back, glaring. 
Why? Kendy was sure he was 
the one who should be carrying 
the grudge. 
Sweating, Kendy tried to feel 
angry. It wasn’t rational to be 
afraid of a kid that small. He 
doubted if Oliver was fourteen 
yet. But Oliver evidently was al
ready enrolled here and would 
have the advantage of being in 
a higher grade. Kendy reassured 
himself that National University 
wasn’t like West Point with hazing of the plebes and all that 
guff. Anyway, he was only visiting National University. He was 
not committed to enroll here. 
But if he turned chicken, Kendy thought, and didn’t sign up 
at National U. just because 
Oliver was here, he’d be both 
timid and stupid. Oliver was only 
a little — well, what was he? 
Ill 
jtT r. Smith was steering Kendy’s mother along the hall, 
away from the entrance to a dim 
room barred by a steel grillwork 
which was a sliding door. Kendy 
peered through the locked grill 
into the eye-widening semi-darkness at the dim shapes of rifles 
hanging on the walls. His eyebrows rose as he recognized the 
awkward silhouette of an ancient 
Chicomm AK-47 with its forward 
curving magazine. The other 
guns were new to him. His heart 
thudded with sudden excitement. 
Rows of glass cases glinted in 
there, but he couldn’t see what 
they contained. From one of the 
rifles on the wall hung wires and 
a battery. He had to admit to 
himself he was itching to handle all those guns. He hurried 
away as if he needed to escape 
from something. 
The coffeeteria reeked with the 
odor of cheese burning. A tall 
man wearing a really sharp 
sport coat was trying to scrape a 
smoking cheese sandwich out of 
the infrared dispenser. Kendy 
guessed he must be another recruiter because a mother, father, 
and son were seated at one of 
the round tables with four coffee cups but only two cheese 
sandwiches in front of them, and 
they were looking around uncomfortably. 
To his surprise, Kendy’s mother was smiling. Mr. Smith had 
brought her a lunch of everything 
she liked best. As Kendy moved 
KENDY'S WORLD 
to join them, Mr. Smith removed 
his arm from behind her chair 
and interrupted their conversation to point to the gleaming 
row of snack dispensers. “You 
don’t need coins, just help yourself.” 
Feeling like a fifth wheel, Kendy went and stood in front of the 
infrared dispenser. He pushed 
the buttons, trying to force it to 
grill him a cheese sandwich. It 
hummed. Oliver’s image loomed 
in his memory as if the kid were 
a monster Gollum instead of — 
Two summers ago, Oliver 
would have been only twelve. 
Kendy had been a Junior Counsellor at that damned camp for 
Gifted Children. The second 
morning, Kendy had tried to conduct his first inspection in his 
tribe’s tent. Oliver slouched beside his messy cot, gulping air 
and contemptuously belching. Although Kendy didn’t bother to 
make his own bed at home, he 
had tried to enforce the rules 
here in the camp, and he suggested to Oliver that they reason together. The sheet must be folded 
over and the corners of the 
blanket must be square. Oliver 
blurted a four-letter word. Kendy 
applied a hammerlock. Oliver 
screamed like a girl, startling. 
Kendy so much he let go. 
O liver complained to the Senior Counsellor, and this 
grizzled college student took 
Kendy aside. “The kid’s father 
is some sort of space scientist 
whose wife is a Senator’s daughter, so don’t let him get away 
with anything. Your job is to 
enforce the rules, the same for 
everybody. Just don’t leave any 
marks on his body, so the Director will know you haven’t used 
force.” 
Each morning, Kendy had harrassed Oliver until he made his 
cot. Scowling, Oliver would run 
outside and harrass a fat kid, 
who didn’t know how to defend 
himself. Oliver was master of the 
sly kick and the innocent denial. 
When Kendy tried to mobilize 
opinion in the tent against Oliver’s bullying, the other little kids 
seemed unconcerned. When Oliver deliberately stood up in the 
war canoe, Kendy fined him a 
week’s desserts. In the mess hall, 
Oliver refused to eat anything, 
and a rumor spread that the food 
was poisoned. When they were 
alone together, Kendy offered to 
shake hands and start over. 
Convulsively gulping, Oliver 
spat on Kendy’s outstretched 
hand. Almost bursting with rage, 
Kendy wiped his hand on Oliver’s 
face. Oliver clamped his teeth 
on Kendy’s finger. Kneeing Oliver, Kendy writhed free. Not 
wanting to escalate, Kendy attempted an orderly withdrawal, 
but Oliver followed with sharp 
kicks and ineffectual karate 
chops. “You stinking bully, I’ll 
.veetcong you/’ 
While defending himself, Kendy hurled the kid against a tent 
pole, mashing his nose. Snorting 
blood and crying, Oliver opened 
his Boy Scout Knife. “I’ll drive 
you out of here if it takes a hundred years.” 
With a thrill of fear, Kendy 
grabbed his wrist and took the 
knife away. He didn’t report the 
incident because Oliver would 
have been expelled. He didn’t report anything. 
The next morning Kendy was 
fired for leaving a mark on a 
camper. With his nose swathed in 
tape, Oliver came up behind him 
while he was packing. Oliver’s 
eyes were magnified by tears. 
“You big bastard, I’ll get you if 
it’s the last thing I ever do.” 
T>y the time tire infrared dispenser disgorged Kendy’s 
bubbling cheese sandwich, his 
mother was digging into chocolate 
pie heaped with whipped cream, 
and Mr. Smith was grinning like 
a shrewd farm boy who puts out 
salt for the cow in order to catch 
the calf. 
“Kendy will have an opportunity to travel in foreign countries,” 
he elaborated. “All over the 
world — ” 
Kendy’s mother dropped her 
fork. “I thought you said he’d 
KENDY'S WORLD 
be protected from the draft.” 
“He will. This would be as an 
exchange student.” 
“As a State Department Cadet,” Kendy muttered through 
the molten cheese sandwich, embarrassed as usual by his mother’s 
abysmal ignorance. 
“That’s one possibility,” Mr. 
Smith tried to agree, and his 
gloved hand reached for the 
sugar. “There are other — opportunities — in civilian government 
with more future for a young man 
than the State Department.” He 
was smiling at Kendy’s mother. 
“We know that big organizations 
grow bigger, and the biggest is 
our government. Who can foresee 
all the opportunities for a young 
man to grow?” 
“The pie was very good,” she 
said, looking around and frowning. 
“During his first two years at 
National University, he’ll enjoy 
the broad general education,” Mr. 
Smith said as he rose to bring her 
a dish of chilled melon balls. 
“We’re rebuilding a reawakened 
citizenry with a renewed understanding of our national purpose.” 
Kendy wondered at the words 
as Mr. Smith looked straight at 
him. 
“We’re building opportunities 
for those few young men who 
have the intelligence and courage 
to shape our future.” 
Corn-ball, Kendy thought, but 
someone would have to lead, and 
Oliver’s sharp face loomed in his 
imagination. Kendy chewed the 
gluey cheese sandwich. National 
University might be big enough 
for both of them, but he didn’t 
want to go here. He decided he’d 
be happier back in high school for 
his senior year. 
“How would you straighten 
things out?” Mr. Smith’ said to 
him. 
Shocked by the question and 
the fact that it was directed at 
him, Kendy tried to disengage his 
bicuspids from the cheese sandwich; he swallowed hard. “I guess 
I’d like to — the State Department — the diplomatic service — 
at least trying to maintain some 
communication between us and 
Russia, so nations would understand.” 
“Good for you!” His mother 
took him off the hook. “You can 
get an even broader education at 
Harvard. That’s where nearly 
everyone in the State Department comes from anyway. Remember what a nice letter you 
got from the registrar. Next year 
when you’re a senior they’ll — ” 
“Mother!” Kendy blurted. 
“Yes, I’ve heard that Harvard 
is a fairly good college,” Mr. 
Smith replied calmly. “Because 
you’re only sixteen, you could go 
there for two years until you’re 
called up for your two years of 
Universal National Service to 
156 
plant trees in the mornings and 
study patriotism in the afternoons, assuming your lucky number didn’t come up for the draft.” 
Tf endy looked away, his ears 
burning. Unsaid was how 
National University was a step 
ahead of other universities. To 
hell with that, Kendy thought, 
maybe he’d volunteer and join 
the Green Berets. However, Congress had decreed that two years 
attendance here at N.U. did count 
as the Universal National Service 
requirement. 
“I’m going to level with you,” 
Mr. Smith said. “National University is tougher in its way than 
Harvard, and you’re only sixteen 
years old.” 
“Younger kids than that,” 
Kendy muttered, thinking of Oliver. 
“You think you can hack it 
here? The only kids who do make 
it are brilliant young men with 
great maturity and patriotism and 
espirit de corps.” Mr. Smith stood 
up, and Kendy felt something 
slipping away. 
Mr. Smith’s hand closed on his 
shoulder. “Let me show you our 
squadroom. We call it the barn. 
There are ten guys on our team. 
I’d be your advisor if you want 
me.” He squeezed Kendy’s shoulder and smiled at his mother. 
“Excuse us for about ten minutes,” he apologized. “Down 
where we’re going is man’s country.” 
Corn-ball, Kendy thought, but 
Ke couldn’t help responding to 
Mr. Smith, although he couldn’t 
quite understand why. 
Their elevator plunged all the 
way to the minus-seven level. 
From the elevator, a metal bridge 
led straight across a shouting 
group of boys playing full-court 
basketball on the level below. 
There were whiffs of chlorine 
from a swimming pool somewhere 
as Mr. Smith led him from the 
bridge to a hallway dazzling with 
artificial daylight from the ceiling. The widely spaced doors 
were numbered. 
“Squadroom Nine is ours. 
Nine! Nine!” Mr. Smith repeated, 
and the door finally buzzed and 
opened itself into a reception office which had been converted 
into a television room. 
A burr-headed kid, who had 
been watching galloping mayhem, 
acrobatically yanked both feet 
off the coffee table and landed 
erect. “Hi! Sir, you’re back just 
in time to help me with my calc.” 
“Then start doing it,” Mr. 
Smith suggested, taking a backhanded swipe at him. 
The kid ducked, laughing, and 
Kendy realized the boy liked Mr. 
Smith. While introducing them, 
Mr. Smith said seriously “Kendy 
will put some life in our basketball team.” 
KENDY'S WORLD 
G rinning at the compliment, 
Kendy felt himself being 
pushed by Mr. Smith into the 
squadroom. He squinted at its artificial daylight ceiling. As the 
images of clouds drifted across 
Kendy wondered if strato-cumulus clouds were forming up there 
in the real sky. He guessed this 
ceiling worked the same as the 
commercially suppressed television method his high school chem 
class had been allowed to play 
with; organic liquid crystals were 
sandwiched between panes of 
glasses. The inner surfaces of the 
glass had been coated with a 
transparent conductor. He remembered the maze of wires from 
the thousands of inductors on the 
back of the glass. The wires converged into the electro-optical 
converter box. When it was plugged into their video tape player, 
they watched a dim American 
flag waving inside the glass sandwich as if it were a flat television tube. When they raised the 
Venetian blinds, increasing the 
light in the classroom, the flag 
had brightened. Unlike a television tube, the glass sandwich did 
not radiate light, but reflected it 
selectively. 
And here beneath the artificial 
sky, Kendy saw that the primary 
illumination came from upwardaimed floodlights concealed in 
the walls. He wondered whether 
a T.V. camera on the roof was 
aimed at tlie sky. More likely a 
video tape player in some dark 
closet was connected to tlie electro-optical converter. Reacting to 
the moving tape, the converter 
was transmitting varying positive 
and negative charges to the millions of induction contact points 
on the back of the glass sandwich 1 . 
All the fluctuating electrical currents were causing turbulence 
within the liquid crystals, varying their opacity, and thus varying the light-reflecting qualities 
within this glass ceiling so that 
clouds seemed to be drifting 
across a blue sky. 
“Living together in one big 
room,” Mr. Smith said, “helps all 
ten guys be good friends. There 
is more privacy than you’d have 
in the Army.” 
Kendy was staring at the stalls. 
There were five on each side of 
the grass-green carpet. 
“This would be yours.” 
Tts mahogany plywood walls 
provided head-high’ privacy 
on both sides, and its sawdustcolored carpet seemed springy beneath Kendy’s feet. Along one 
wall, the wardrobe closets and 
built-in drawers could hold everything he owned. Although the 
stall was as big as a so-called 
double room in some college 
dorms, it seemed crowded, dominated by the electrically adjustable bed which hummed when 
158 
Kendy pushed the HEAD-UP, 
button. The pillow support was 
being tilted up within the bed’s 
high redwood frame of adjustable shelves, overhead tensor 
lights, swing-out writing board, 
snack-box, television and cartridge stereo with earphones for 
slumber learning. 
“With’ your long arms, you can 
rearrange all this built-in bedside junk so you can reach everything without moving your butt.” 
Mr. Smith’s gloved hand reached 
into the bed’s adjustable frame 
and twisted a rheostat. 
Kendy’s vision seemed to be 
dimming. Above this stall, one 
rectangle of the squadroom’s high 
artificial sky was darkening. Venus appeared and then the other 
stars in Kendy’s sky. Curtains 
crept across the front of the stall. 
Mr. Smith yawned and opened a 
little door in its rear wall. 
“Here’s your private study 
cell.” It had dark plywood walls 
and a low ceiling. 
Kendy instinctively ducked his 
head. The study room seemed 
small, and yet it contained a 
darkvinyl couch' and a matching 
chair, facing an educational console at least twice as wide as the 
one he’d been shown at U.C.L.A. 
Four graduate students had shared that console. This one gleamed with fascinating gadgets including an attached helmet and 
wristbands. 
“You can be your own best 
teacher. Be ten years before 
Harvard students get anything 
like this,” Mr. Smith said, opening the cabinet above the couch, 
revealing a mini-refrigerator unit 
with a two-burner electric stove 
on top and pull-out counter underneath beside a small sink with 
built-in coffee brewer. 
“Over here is your meditation 
room,” Mr. Smith said, turning to 
the opposite wall and sliding open 
a narrow door. “The throne is 
comfortable, but these bathtubs 
are too short for stretched-out 
creative thinking. I’ll show you 
my suite. I rate a six-foot tub.” 
IV 
TT'rom Kendy’s dim stall, they 
-*■ walked beneath the late afternoon sky in the squadroom to 
a panelled conference room at the 
far end. 
“I referee in here,” Mr. Smith 
said, slapping the back of his mahogany captain’s chair in passing. 
It was the only chair at the 
round table. The other chairs 
were stacked in a corner. Around 
the table lay upholstered seminar 
couches rumpled from use, and 
an aging banana peel sprawled 
like a brown octopus among the 
candy wrappers. Kendy thought 
this mess looked funny in such 
an expensive building. 
There was a click as Mr. Smith 
KENDY'S WORLD 
unlocked the door to his suite. 
Smiling he gestured Kendy ahead 
into a panelled living room complete with fieldstone fireplace 
and birds fluttering around an 
iceberg in the artificial picturewindow. 
“I shot this rug with my little 
old M-16,” M. Smith said happily, poking the polar bear’s open 
jaws with his wide brown shoe, 
which appeared oddly short as if 
he lacked toes.“ Had to feed him 
a whole clip. In here’s the dinettekitchenette.” 
Kendy looked up at a reddish 
fish, resembling a salmon, displayed above the ultrasonic sink. 
“Arctic char. When the rivers 
thaw, they’ll even rise to a fly 
— well, at least to a fast-moving 
Silver Doctor,” Mr. Smith said. 
“When I was starving, I caught a 
bigger char on ermine guts and a 
#4 hook, but that was in Siberia. 
I guess you’ve managed to deduce 
that I’m not the intellectual type. 
Maybe I’m supposed to counterbalance your professors. We advisors are.” He opened a door. 
“I junked the government issue 
furniture in this bedroom and 
built my own. Check this homey 
touch.” 
The circular bed revolved. 
“Made it myself,” Mr. Smith’s 
voice continued proudly, but 
Kendy was staring at the langorous painting on the wall. 
His imagination jumped at her. 
Since kindergarten, Kendy had 
been exposed to pregnant rabbits 
and see-through plastic ladies and 
“Growth” lectures and “Understanding Your Emotions” courses 
and “Marriage and Your Future 
Family" series nearly every semester so that his technical 
knowledge of female anatomy 
was impeccable, yet his imagination was driving him crazy. He 
devoured her with’ his gaze. 
Shamefully, he was still inexperienced, although he was halfway 
to seventeen and burning with desire. “That’s — uh — pretty good 
painting.” 
“Can’t bring girls into the 
squadroom,” Mr. Smith said, as 
if reading his mind and flattering him. “I’m not kidding. We 
have to enforce congressional 
moral standards.” 
“Cars?” 
“Now there’s the magic word. 
Unfortunately not even our biggest athletic jocks are issued cars. 
I admit this puts us at a recruiting disadvantage. National U. is 
so new and our few classes of 
alumni are so scattered all over 
the world that practically nobody 
here can expect to find car keys 
under his pillow. You’re not even 
allowed to keep your own car 
on campus until you’re an Upper 
Division Student with at least a 
3.0 grade-point average.” 
“You’re kidding?” Actually, 
Kendy didn’t own a car yet and 
160 
was sure Mr. Smith knew it. 
“The solution would be to garage your car in San Luis Obispo 
where the weekend action is. During the week I have to make 
bedchecks at midnight.” Mr. 
Smith' sighed. “But groovy guys 
use their ingenuity. Some have 
even built dummies that breathe 
to fool me. Then they go running 
away through the dark.” 
TTe clumped back into the living room, and his voice faltered. “Ken-Kendy, since I recruited you — I hope you’ll sign 
up for my squadroom. I’m not 
trying to con you. You can get 
a good education here, and your 
country does need you. I’m not 
trying to set the hook in you.” 
Mr. Smith’s face appeared almost twentyish', both eager and 
worried, as if he were once again 
a young — whatever he had been. 
“We want you. Listen, you can 
learn here whatever you really 
want to learn.” He grinned, tightening away his jowls. “What the 
hell. Congress tells us to teach 
patriotism. But that’s something 
you’ve got to learn for yourself — 
All right, let’s go back to your 
mother.” 
In the coffeeteria, Kendy’s 
mother stood up, hastily pushing 
aside cantaloupe rind. “You’ve 
seen everything by now, I suppose. Are you sure you want 
“Of course I’m sure,” Kendy 
retorted, although he hadn’t been 
sure at all he’d intended to think 
it over. But he told her firmly: 
“Here’s where I want to go to 
college.” 
Flying through the night on 
the commercial jet from San Luis 
Obispo to Los Angeles Off-Shore 
Airport, she asked him, “You’re 
not making Mr. Smith another 
father-image like your jayvee 
basketball coach couldn’t be — 
or something — are you?” 
Kendy glared at her and barely 
spoke during the interminable 
landing pattern. Then he felt 
choked up and helped her into 
the periscopic stairway as if she 
were a little old lady. She was 
almost forty, he thought, with 
her remaining years dwindling 
away. He felt both protective 
and trapped. Trying to help her 
into the cab, he toppled in behind her. 
“You can let go of my apron 
strings,” she remarked, lighting a 
cigarette. “If this is the big split, 
I’m proud of you.” She put her 
arm around him. “You’ll make 
some girl a good husband.” She 
laughed. “Don’t let her, or anyone, con you any worse than 
these stinkers already are doing.” 
“Who’s conning me,” he said. 
“My God, you don’t know after 
today?” Her broad face quivered 
as if she were going to laugh. 
He didn’t want to know. Men
162 
tally he was packing his bags. 
In their apartment, she looked 
up into his face. “And you don’t 
even remember your father,” she 
cried. 
“I do,” He muttered, wishing to 
God He did. “Nobody’s going to 
con me,” he blurted, unsure whether He meant Mr. Smith or her. 
npo escape, he went into the 
bedroom and tried to read 
the newspaper. 
In West Virginia, the rebuilding of Tin Woodman Had been 
Held up by a wildcat strike, and 
the F.B.I. was investigating. Kendy shined' his shoes on the Los 
Angeles Times editorial page 
which complained that the Soviet 
Union was interfering with our 
right to explore everything on the 
Moon. Their crawlers had blocked an American geological survey 
team outside the crater where the 
Soviet’s vinyl dome was being inflated. After it had been pumped 
full of congealing bubblets, the 
Soviets failed to coat it with the 
usual aluminum reflectant, and 
Kendy wondered if this was because the dome would House some 
sort of broadcasting aerial. He 
switched on the bathroom television to Multi-News, where the 
grayish dome was under surveillance from the U.S. tele satellites. 
With machetes, the Soviets 
seemed to be chopping Headroom within the bubblet dome. 
They pushed out masses of bubblets like snow from the airlock 
and carried in equipment better 
suited for hard-rock drilling than 
broadcasting. Their next landing 
rocket disgorged what appeared 
to be an important personage. 
Clustering about him, the other 
space suits Helped him. 
In the United States, the latest 
unmanned Mars rocket ruptured 
itself during a static test. Reportedly, it had been reprogrammed 
to attach itself to PHobos in the 
manner of the unsuccessful Lotka 
II, Hopefully to shuttle its landing 
module down to Mars. Now the 
Boar dof Inquiry decided it Had 
been sabotaged. 
S aying good-bye at Los Angeles 
Off-SHore Airport, Kendy 
kissed his mother. “Stay cool,” 
her voice choked. “Don’t let them 
con you. Stay free.” In the jet, he 
tried to lose his emotions among 
the pages of the Los Angeles 
Times. Significantly, the convicted dynamiter of Tin Woodman 
was being exchanged for an 
American tourist who’d been convicted of a currency violation in 
Leningrad. Kendy wondered if 
the Soviets, muffled and gagged 
within their own security procedures, were trying to tell us 
something, using dynamite instead of words. Earlier this morning, Tin Woodman had been dynamited again. 
KENDY'S WORLD 
On the bus from San Luis 
Obispo to National University, 
Kendy felt more concerned with 
his own problems. He was afraid 
Oliver would deliberately make 
trouble for him. But He grinned 
with excitement as he stood in the 
immense circle of tile-roofed 
buildings. He Had a feeling of 
freedom. 
Seven levels belows the surface, 
when Kendy lugged his suitcase 
into Squadroom Nine, Mr. Smith 
yelled with pleasure. “I have your 
class registration cards. Come on 
back to the conference room.” 
“I’ve been studying the catalogue,” Kendy said, “and I Have 
a pretty good idea what I want 
to take.” He laid his list on the 
table. 
“Good choices,” said Mr. 
Smith’. “But Russian would be 
an even better choice than Spanish. I don’t want to pressure you, 
but as your advisor — ” Both of 
them reached for the catalogue. 
But Kendy’s hand was quicker. 
“Sir, I need only one more year 
of Spanish to — ” 
“You’ll need more than one 
foreign language,” Mr. Smith interrupted, “if you really want to 
be a diplomat.” He awkwardly 
placed a gloved Hand on Kendy’s 
shoulder. “You’d better start 
studying Russian, from the — inside. For example, the word mit 
means world. Also mit can mean 
the pre-Revolution village and 
its decision-making method. The 
peasants discussed a problem until the village elder announced 
there had been a unanimous decision. All conformed. If you did 
not, you became an outcast. But 
mir means more than a village 
commune or the world. Mir also 
is the Russian word for peace. So 
their word for peace, mir, may 
have different connotations and 
implications in a Russian diplomat’s mind than our conception 
of peace. If you’re trying to understand this world, much less 
whoever’s beeping at us from 
somewhere out there beyond Arcturus, consider that one man’s 
peace may mean another man’s 
poison. Paz, paix?” 
“Peace in Spanish and French, 
I guess,” Kendy muttered, knowing very well that this conversation was becoming an arm-twister 
to make him sign up for Russian. 
C ( Oace,” said Mr. Smith, rais■*- ing his palm as if he were 
the Pope. “Interestingly, the 
word for peace in Roumanian 
also is pace. The Swedes, Norwegians and Danes all say {red. 
Frieden is peace in German. In 
Dutch, it’s vrede. Czech : mir, like 
the Russians but pronounced a 
little differently. You can absorb 
the surface of another language 
every month, while you sleep, using the earphones and cerebral 
contacts in your bed.” 
Kendy opened his mouth. He 
wanted to continue taking Spanish. 
Mr. Smith said: “You’ll need 
to get beneath the surface of languages. Mir may mean peace to 
Russians, but Finns say ruaha. 
Turks say sulh, but Greeks say 
irini. Israelis say shalom, and 
Arabs say salam. Those are 
similar sounds which mean peace 
but not the same kind of peace. 
When you sign up for Russian 
here at National University you 
will be immersed in a Russian living experience for two hours a 
day so that you can get beneath 
the surface of the language. Let’s 
consider the rest of your class 
schedule.” 
Mr. Smith laid down a card 
on which he’d written the titles of 
six courses. Kendy put his own 
list beside it. When his mother 
had looked over his shoulder at 
the catalogue, she’d said National 
U. must be returning to the Dark 
Ages. Instead of offering one or 
two big unified experimental 
courses per semester like other 
universities, National U. apparently expected students to sign 
up for five or six unrelated 
courses as in the 1960’s when 
she was in school. She remarked 
that National U. might be trying 
to revive the Good Old 1950’s 
when the present administrators 
were such silent college boys 
themselves. She said Kendy’s list 
of courses seemed ridiculously 
old-fashioned. If she had seen Mr. 
Smith’s list she would Have 
squawked with rage and dissent. 
Only American Aspirations was 
the same on both lists, and it 
was a required course. For Kendy’s choice of Spanish IV, Mr. 
Smith had substituted Russian 
I ; for Biochemestry, Integral Calculus for Physiology, Physics; for 
Political Science, Military Science and Tactics; and for Basketball, unarmed Combat. 
6 (, T T ow come Unarmed Com-O- bat?” Kendy blurted. 
“You already look good as a 
basketball player — when you 
mature,” Mr. Smith tried to explain. “The only boys — men — 
allowed to enroll in Basketball 
for credit are the varsity players 
we’ve recruited, so we’re looking 
forward to your helping us on 
the intramural dorm team.” 
“I didn’t realize I was trying 
to sign up for the Varsity,” Kendy murmured, embarrassed. “But 
how come Unarmed Combat?” 
“One reason National University students are excused from the 
draft is because it’s understood 
that they will take Military Science and Tactics and a physical 
education course such as Unarmed Combat.” 
“Oh?” Kendy considered standing up and going home, but He’d 
told all his high school friends 
KENDY'S WORLD 
He’d been accepted at National 
University, and he’d have to explain — 
“Integral Calculus is a necessary foundation stone for any 
science today.” Mr. Smith’s 
gloved finger descended on Biochemistry, blotting it out. 
“But I was a member of the 
Biochem club,” Kendy protested. 
“That’s where the future is — in 
the sciences.” 
“Okay, fair enough,” Mr. 
Smith said so smoothly that 
Kendy suspected he was being 
handed a pre-planned little victory in exchange for something 
else. “If you’ll scratch Physiology 
off your list, I’ll scratch Physics 
off of mine.” 
“That’s giving me the double 
shuffle,” Kendy retorted, standing up, deciding to go home and 
to Hell with it! “Where’s the broad 
general education you were talking about?” 
Instinctively, he was trying to 
enrage Mr. Smith so that Mr. 
Smith would be the one to make 
the break and kick him out. Or 
if Mr. Smith had laughed, Kendy would Have been able to get 
angry enough himself to break 
free. But Mr. Smith peered up 
at him with a Hurt expression. 
“Ken — Kendy, you will get a 
broad general education. This 
seminar that I lead — - see its 
title is American Aspirations. The 
eleven of us meet right here in 
this conference room every day 
discussing our futures, and that 
is what I try to do. This is what 
I want to do. This is why I’m 
Here, to be your advisor — for 
your own country. Your country 
needs help. Don’t just ask what 
your country can do for you.” 
V 
A fter Kendy had signed the six 
class registration cards and 
wearily unpacked in his stall, 
He met the other nine boys in 
Squadroom Nine. He decided this 
was the last time Mr. Smith 
would con him. He didn’t ask 
which squadroom Oliver inhabited. 
That night in the cafeteria line, 
he saw Oliver’s pale face. He imagined a gulping sound as Oliver 
looked away. Clutching their 
trays, they drifted in opposite 
directions as cautiously as two 
scorpions in a very large bottle. 
Kendy knew this eight-level underground dorm building contained nearly eigfit hundred students. Unfortunately, Oliver’s 
squadroom also was located on 
this minus-seventK level. Six 
times a day they passed each 
other in the hall without speaking. Sometimes Oliver would be 
trotting to keep up with a huge 
blond boy who sported a military 
crew-cut and' a razor-nicked chin. 
By contrast, Kendy was becom1 66 
ing enamored of the one girl he 
saw regularly from a distance of 
about ten feet, the teaching assistant in charge of their biochem lab section, but he didn’t 
follow her around. She was at 
least nineteen and very serious, 
quietly trying to maintain order. 
But that damned Oliver was in 
the same lab section, noisily 
showing off his superior knowledge of all the positions of adenine-thymine base pairs which 
rat-ify the double helices of a 
rat’s genes. 
Kendy was pleasantly surprised 
to be elected Representative for 
his squadroom, even though five 
of his squadmates were sophomores. For some reason, none of 
them wanted the job. Every 
Thursday night, as Representative, he had to attend the Seventh 
Level meeting. 
The Seventh Level President 
turned out to be the huge blond 
boy with stubble on his head and 
shaving scrapes on his chin. He 
came from Oliver’s squadroom. 
His name was Rog, and he was 
in training for the State Department. When a squadroom representative stood up and mumbled 
about saltpeter, and blurted that 
his constitutients wanted an investigation of the cafeteria food, 
Rog banged his gavel. “A little 
saltpeter won’t hurt what you 
haven’t got. What is important 
is for Seventh Level to get re
GALAXY 
venge for last year. I want each: 
Rep to go back to his squadroom 
and find out which guys got letters in basketball in high school, 
and I want all of them out on the 
court in their shorts in one hour. 
Now let’s hear a motion to adjourn this meeting.” 
TV*' endy made his third mistake 
-^*-by watching that intramural 
basketball practice. In his streetclothes because he lacked a varsity letter, he stood on the bridge 
above the Eighth Level court. 
Rog lumbered out on the floor 
with an orange ball and tin whistle and with Oliver trotting behind. Carrying a clipboard, Oliver was chattering excitedly. 
Kendy looked down at them. The 
view from the bridge distorted 
Rog so that he looked like a 
squatty football player, and this 
same foreshortening effect made 
Oliver look as though he’d been 
stepped on. As seen from above, 
Oliver’s head was slickly black, 
while Rog’s appeared pinkish because his blond hair was cropped so short. 
“Where are all my men?” Rog 
kept shouting. 
Eight men finally straggled onto the court, enough for two practice teams by the new college 
rules. The four-man team rule 
had been intended to reduce congestion under the baskets so that 
basketball would become less of a 
KENDY'S WORLD 
contact sport. Rog ran them 
through a lay-up drill, in which 
some farmers took off on the 
wrong foot. When they started 
practicing three-point set-shots 
from the outside, Kendy thought 
the lighting might be bothering 
them. When Rog tried to referee 
them in a practice game, some 
kept fighting for the rebounds after each missed free shot, as in 
high school rules, while others 
protested that in college the foul 
shooter got to take the ball out 
of bounds after his free shot, 
whether he made it or not. This 
frequently revised college rule 
was supposed to discourage intentional fouling and speed up 
the game. The players ran slower 
and slower because they were so 
out of shape. 
Ignoring Oliver, Kendy wandered down beside the court, fascinated by the ineffectual and 
missed lay-ups. He thought the 
players must have won their letters at extremely small high 
schools. When Rog finally allowed the wheezing sufferers to depart, the sweaty ball rolled toward Kendy. 
H e knew what he wanted to do, 
but he was hesitant to do it, 
so he ignored Oliver and did it! 
Dribbling smoothly and flexibly 
toward the basket, He tried a relaxed right-hand lay-up, softly 
off the backboard and in. Warm
167 
ing up, dribbling faster with his 
long leg muscles loosening until he felt light-footed as a grasshopper again. He tried a left-hand 
layup. Beautiful! Because Rog 
seemed to be leaving, Kendy 
raced around into a dribble-drive 
toward the right side of the backboard. With a fierce gasp, he 
leaped high, stretching higher, 
slamming down the ball through 
the hoop in a right-hand dunk 
shot that banged his little finger 
against the iron rim. Dropping 
from the air triumphantly, he 
barely felt the pain. 
“Where’d you letter?” Rog demanded. “You look better than 
those farmers.” 
And Oliver was staring with 
hatred so obvious Kendy felt as 
if they were back in that camp 
for gifted children for an instant with Oliver gulping and 
his sharp face so contorted he 
seemed ready to spit. 
Kendy had made the team. 
“You’re my forward,” Rog 
said, ignoring Oliver. “Let’s hit the 
showers.” Oliver was left standing. 
When they came out of the 
locker room, Oliver came scrambling down the staircase from the 
Seventh Level, breathing hard as 
if he’d run back to his room. 
“Rog, I have the rest of that good 
pie. It’s in my mini-frig.” 
“We’ll go up to the coffeeteria 
so Kendy can come along.” Rog 
168 
ambled to the elevator, talking 
to Kendy, while Oliver trotted 
behind, chattering desperately. 
In the coffeeteria, the clean-up 
men were turning off the lights, 
but Rog laughed at them and 
handed Kendy a three-flavored 
Sundae from the machine. The 
two of them kidded around. Kendy had learned how to get along 
with football jocks in high school, 
where most of them had supported his unsuccessful election campaign and Rog didn’t seem too 
different. 
O liver shut up, gave up and 
went down. Kendy felt malicious triumph. Finally, Kendy 
was getting Rog another round of 
Cokes, and Rog was laughing and 
slapping the infrared machine 
and chasing away the janitor, 
who kept trying to turn off the 
last light, when Oliver reappeared, his pale face seeming even 
narrower from rage. He gulped 
and smiled at Rog. “This — 
frosh — ” He turned his sharp 
face to Kendy. “He keeps saying 
he’s a better shot than you.” 
“He is. He is,” Rog laughed, 
crushing his own paper cup into 
a ball but missing his one-hand 
set shot at the Coke machine. 
“Not with a gun,” Oliver said. 
“Yeah, I’m also captain of the 
rifle team.” Rog grinned at Kendy and fired his imaginary submachine gun at the janitor. 
Oliver ennunciated with practiced clarity. “You haven’t seen 
the little Czech Model 81 they 
have added to the collection.” 
“UH-uh.” Rog reloaded his invisible sub-macKine gun. “WHat 
you trying to pull this time?” 
“It’s a really cute little firespitter,” Oliver remarked, and 
then his voice rose uncontrollably. 
“Even loaded with the twentyshot magazine, it weighs only 
four pounds because it fires caseless ammo, electrically ignited.” 
“What am I supposed to do, 
dream about it?” 
“I have the key.” 
“The hell you say!” Rog lowered his voice. 
“Kenny, or whatever your 
name is,” Oliver said, smiling as 
if this were the first time they’d 
met, “why don’t you go to bed?” 
“Okay,” Kendy replied, smiling 
back at Oliver and feeling cautious rather than angry because 
he was being challenged he preferred bed to trouble. 
Unexpectedly, Rog draped a 
heavy arm around him. “You 
come with us, Kendy. If this little 
spook can really open the Trophy 
Room, you’ll want to see those 
crazy contraptions we — they — 
someone took away from the 
K.G.B., so come along with us.” 
Kendy grinned defiantly at 
Oliver. 
The dim hallway was empty. 
As always, the sliding grillwork 
KENDY'S WORLD 
door was locked. Now the inner 
steel door also was locked. They 
couldn’t see into the Trophy 
Room. To Kendy’s surprise, Oliver had put on black silk gloves. 
Deftly as a surgeon, he inserted 
the key, turned the lock, spread 
apart the grill doors. He leaned 
inward to unlock the inner door, 
using the same key, and Kendy 
began to worry that there might 
be an alarm system. 
As Oliver opened the inner 
door, no alarm sounded. Oliver 
pocketed the key, and Kendy realized that not only had the same 
key fitted both locks, but it was 
such a simple back-door key that 
any shrewd kid with a file could 
shape one. Kendy blinked at the 
darkness. It didn’t seem reasonable for this Trophy Room to be 
so ineffectively guarded. With all 
these kids living here, this seemed 
as negligent as leaving a bulldozer with its motor running; it was 
an attractive hazard. It was so 
easy to break into, he couldn’t 
understand it. 
R og’s powerful hand yanked 
Kendy inside, and Oliver 
slid the doors together like jaws 
closing. In the darkness, a penlight glowed between Oliver’s 
curled fingers. Kendy put 'his 
hands in his pockets, afraid of 
touching anything and leaving 
fingerprints. Rog slapped down 
one big hand on a glass-topped 
170 
case and reached behind it. “Hey, 
yeah, this Model 81 has an image-intensifier." Rog's dark shape 
turned toward Kendy. “Man I 
can really see you through the 
tube! Your forehead is sweating.” 
“Got something better for you,” 
Oliver’s voice hissed. 
He had laid his glowing penlight on top of a glass case and 
was dragging out a shiny double 
wand entangled in wires. It scissored like an obstretrician’s forceps, but it was longer and its 
tips were different. “You act like 
you’re afraid of guns,” Oliver remarked moving toward Kendy. 
“I don’t take them to bed witli 
me at night,” Kendy retorted, 
nervous because Rog kept aiming 
that Model 81 at him and emitting put-put noises. “I’ll bet you 
love guns so much you’ve got a 
big gatefold colored picture of a 
gun pinned above your bed with 
a staple in her navel.” 
Oliver tittered. “You’re talking 
about Rog. That’s his hang-up.” 
“Beautiful gun,” chuckled Rog, 
stroking the long steel receiver of 
the Model 81. 
“Rog, you subscribe to three 
gun magazines,” Oliver hissed, 
hissed, “so Kendy is saying you 
are some kind 1 of a pervert.” 
“No,” Kendy protested. 
At the same time, Rog grunted: “You’re kidding. I hope you 
are kidding.” He was peering at 
Kendy. 
Kendy took an angry step toward Oliver. 
“Catch,” said Oliver, tossing 
the gleaming crossed wands with 
trailing wires straight at Kendy’s 
face. 
Kendy flinched. He could have 
dodged, but the metal rods would 
have struck the floor with a loud 
noise, so he caught them in midair. 
“Hold the other end, stupid,” 
Oliver said. “You want to get 
electrocuted or something? Hold 
the insulated handles.” He scurried toward Kendy and hooked 
the heavy battery box on Kendy’s 
belt. Spread the handles so the 
forehead contacts open wider, a 
little wider than my head.” Oliver 
flipped a switch on the battery 
box, and it hummed against Kendy’s hip as Oliver backed away. 
“Wait till I put on mine.” 
liver was making nervous 
^ gulping sounds as he scuttled behind the counter and dragged out another battery box 
wired to gleaming forceps with 
insulated handles. 
“You probably don’t even remember, you big bully,” Oliver’s 
voice husked at Kenedy. “You 
sadistically broke my nose, you 
son-of-a-bitch.” He was shuffling toward Kendy in the semidarkness with the spread forceps 
gleaming in front of him like 
crossed sabers. “I told you I’d get 
KENDY'S WORLD 
you someday, you big bastard. 
With these we’re the same size. 
En- garde!” 
Unsure if he were kidding, 
Kendy prudently retreated, holding his forceps in front of him like 
a shield. “I didn’t break your 
nose on purpose.” 
Backing away, Kendy wanted 
to escape, to run, to pull the doors 
open, but he would have to turn 
his back to Oliver. “You must be 
crazy.” 
“He’s always kidding around,” 
Rog said calmly. “Teasing bigger 
guys like this, because he’s so little he thinks he can get away with 
it. If he bugs you too much, kick 
him in the groin. He’ll only run 
and complain to me. That’s yfhat 
he does. He thinks I’m his mother 
hen. Don’t you, Oliver?” 
Oliver emitted a wheezing noise 
as if he were laughing or crying. 
Kendy took another backward 
step, feeling cornered, preparing 
to dodge behind the glass case. 
“What happens if your rods 
touch his,” Hog’s voice laughed. 
“Big sparks?” 
“Stand and fight,” Oliver 
wheezed as if he were serious. 
“Nobody will get hurt. You won’t 
remember a thing.” 
“Ollie’s playing he’s in the 4 
K.G.B.,” Rog said. “Like when a 
Russki creeps up behind a defector and clamps the contacts on 
his head and he even forgets how 
to dress himself. Like a baby, he 
Has to learn to talk again. He 
doesn’t remember anything to 
tell.” 
“Will it really do that?” Kendy asked, embarrassed by the 
shrillness of his own voice and 
more afraid they were playing a 
practical joke on him. 
He didn’t like being laughed at. 
“Depends on the voltage.” Oliver laughed. 
“Hey, Oliver,” Rog asked, “did 
you really put the batteries in 
these lobotomizers?” 
Oliver lunged too quickly for 
Kendy’s feet to move. As Kendy 
deflected the thrust by raising the 
rods of his own lobotomizer, there 
was no spark. Kendy lurched behind the glass case and compounded his panic by suspecting 
Oliver’s lobotomizer was operative and his was not. 
“Coward,” Oliver giggled. 
O etreating, Kendy gripped the 
^ closed handles like the club 
that had been the caveman’s lobotomizer. He felt like screaming 
or climbing the walls. If this were 
a joke and he clubbed Oliver on 
the head, there would be an investigation. He didn’t want to be 
expelled. Maybe Oliver was trying to get him expelled as he had 
done from that kiddy kamp. Retreating, Kendy unhooked the 
humming battery box from his 
belt and tried to think ahead. 
“You see, he’s chicken. He’d 
172 
never make your stinking basketball team,” Oliver cried. “Stand 
and fight you thin-skinned 
bully.” 
Kendy edged toward the door, 
defensively holding the lobotomizer in front of him while its 
heavy battery box dangled by its 
wires from his other hand. As 
Oliver lunged, Kendy side-stepped, swinging the battery box 
past Oliver’s knees and around 
them. As the wires jerked, Kendy let go of the lobotomizer, and 
Oliver clumped to his knees. 
“You bastard!” Oliver squeaked, rolling over, entangled by the 
wires, battery box and lobotomizer. Then he began to giggle 
again as Kendy lurched against 
the door handles. 
Hunching his shoulders, Kendy 
struggled to pull apart the steel 
inner doors. They slid apart, and 
he collided with the outer grill 
as Oliver’s shrill giggles and Rog’s 
hoarse guffaws attacked him from 
the rear. He fought the grill open 
and fell down in the corridor. 
“ — bluffed him,” Rog’s voice 
laughed, “and I liked him better 
than you, you little rat . Ollie, 
the switch on this handle — you 
didn’t show him how to turn it 
on, you little sneak. Sleep with 
it!” There was a loud clunk as 
if Rog had dropped the lobotomizer beside Oliver. 
“Don’t go, Rog,” Oliver’s voice 
rose. “You haven’t seen the Chi
GALAXY 
com AK-90 yet. It shoots rocket-assisted 20 millimeter bullets 
that explode. It takes a big strong 
guy like you to held it.” 
“You’re a dirty little freak,” 
Rog’s voice accused. 
“Close the door, please, Rog.” 
Oliver’s voice sank as Kendy 
stalked away along the corridor. 
“I showed you I have more guts 
than he does,” Oliver’s voice implored. “I’ll show you I can drive 
him out of the University.” 
“Forget it, you poor little spook 
— and stop following me around,” 
Rog’s voice rumbled. “Put those 
lobotomizers back in their cases,” 
his hoarse voice went on as the 
steel doors clunked shut. “What 
are you — ” 
VI 
endy stopped where th'e hall 
turned right. His stomach 
hurt. He felt like crying. He was 
so angry with himself for being 
humiliated that he wanted to kill 
Oliver. He imagined his fist 
smashing Oliver’s nose. “That’s 
what he wants — to get me expelled.” Kendy vividly remembered packing his bags in that camp 
for gifted children. “He’ll goad 
me until I beat hell out of him.” 
But Kendy felt Oliver was smarter than that now. “He hasn’t got 
the guts. He’ll use his brains.” 
Kendy’s own stomach felt so 
disturbed that he went into the 
KENDY'S WORLD 
hall restroom. He sat in a stall 
remembering that his fingerprints 
were in the Trophy Room on the 
door handles and smeared on the 
glass cases and on the lobotomizer. Oliver might leave that lobotomizer lying broken on the 
floor deliberately. The security 
guard would find it when he unlocked the Trophy Room in the 
morning. There would be a quick 
investigation. 
On enrollment day, as at the 
State Universities, the thumb and 
index finger prints of all the new 
students had been taken. But National University was toughest, 
he thought. Not only had they expelled the freshman who had lid 
in his suitcase, they’d turned him 
over to the San Luis Obispo sheriff’s deputies as a minor to be 
charged with possession of marijuana and while he was being 
held in County Jail the federals 
had done a recheck in his home 
town, opened sealed juvenile records and found he’d confessed to 
presenting an adult’s driver’s license during an attempt to buy 
a six-pack of beer. So now they 
were charging him with the federal offense of falsifying his application for enrollment at National 
University, in which he’d signed 
that he was of good moral character. 
Kendy’s guts felt watery. He 
sat there idly reading the graffiti. 
A couple of them were defiantly 
funny. He began to feel better, 
less paranoid, he decided. Maybe 
He should simply do nothing. If 
Oliver did try to frame him, he’d 
simply tell the truth' to Mr. 
Smith 1 . 
His eyes blurred. At least he’d 
find out if Mr. Smith really was 
his friend. He closed his eyes. His 
thoughts were confused. 
The investigation at least might 
discover a few of Oliver’s gloveprints upon his own greasy fingermarks, or Rog would talk too 
much. All three of them might be 
expelled together. Kendy thought 
if Oliver used his brains instead 
of jealousy, he’d realize a frameup was too risky, particularly because he couldn’t depend on Rog. 
Rog had seemed ready for a permanent split. Oliver would have 
to face it. Kendy thought Oliver 
might end up hating Rog more 
than him. The thing to do was to 
wait it out; if nothing happened, 
it was best not to get involved 
between those two any more. 
Kendy walked out of the restroom feeling considerably better. 
He believed Oliver would retain 
enough cool to put all the guns 
back in their proper places, or 
Rog would. But he walked back 
around the bend in the hallway. 
A head of him, the four lines 
where walls met ceiling and 
floor seemed to converge. In the 
distance, beside the wastebasket 
on the floor, a shapeless hulk 
moved. Kendy blinked. His throat 
made a choking sound. He wanted to retreat to the safety of his 
bed. The hulk was trying to crawl 
farther from the Trophy Room, 
dragging its right arm and left 
leg as if partially paralyzed. 
Kendy wanted to be somewhere 
else. He wanted to believe he was 
an innocent bystander who could 
sneak away. He tottered, and the 
hall seemed to be tilting downhill 
toward Rog’s spastically crawling body. 
The huge guy tried to rise, but 
his dragging left leg seemed to 
be pulling him down. His right 
arm flapped feebly at the air 
like an uncoordinated seal’s flipper, and his face sank to the floor. 
“I’ll kill the little bastard,” 
Kendy whimpered, swaying as if 
his own body didn’t know which’ 
way to move. 
He ran to Rog and tried to 
hoist all that bone-heavy weight 
to a sitting position against the 
wall. In the opposite wall, the 
grillwork door of the Trophy 
Room and the steel door behind 
it both were closed as if nothing 
had happened. 
“Where’s Oliver?” Kendy asked harshly. 
Rog emitted a gurgling sound, 
trying to speak. Kendy noticed an 
odor like burnt hair and a dimesized blister on the side of his 
head. The whole right side of 
Rog’s face was twisted down, and 
the words slopped out thickly. “ — 
mm I drunk again?” 
Kendy wished he could believe 
it. He struggled to hoist the uncoordinated weight and put Reg 
©n his own right leg. With his 
shoulder under Rog’s left armpit, 
Kendy tried to maneuver them 
up the hall. He wanted to sneak 
the gurgling body back to its own 
squadroom. In Rog’s own bed 
maybe he could sleep it off and in 
the morning awaken as Rog 
again. Kendy wanted to believe 
that. 
But they weren’t going to make 
it. With shivering legs, he managed to support Rog as far as the 
hall restroom. They toppled in. 
Falling away from Kendy’s grasp, 
Rog barely missed hitting his 
head on the basin. He hit the tile 
floor instead. Kendy winced. 
Rog rolled over and sat up, 
rubbing the side of his head with 
the wrist of his good arm and 
peering up at Kendy. The black 
pupil of Rog’s right eye was much 
larger than his left. “You slugged me — from behind?” 
“No.” Kendy wanted to leave 
him there. Now this mess would 
get all three of them expelled. 
“Don’t get up,” Kendy protested. “You’ll fall down again. X”m 
going to go get Mr. Smith.” 
TT" endy felt a rising sensation, a 
warmth that made him want 
KENDY'S WORLD 
to cry. He couldn’t understand it. 
He wanted to believe that Mr. 
Smith would help him and cover 
for him and to protect him like 
— as if — like a father. But he 
was afraid it was going to be the 
same as the time when the jayvee 
basketball coach had let him 
down. 
His advisor lay on his back on 
top of his round bed, asleep in 
his underwear with the light on. 
His stubby, bare feet pointed at 
the ceiling. One foot had a little 
toe sticking up. From the other 
foot, all the toes had been amputated. Kendy glanced from the 
photograph on the dresser, which 
showed three men grinning in 
furry -rimmed parkas, to the neck 
of the fifth of bourbon protruding 
from the top drawer. 
“Panidyelnik?” Mr. Smith 
muttered, screening his eyes with 
a gray-gloved hand. “What are 
you doing in my room?” 
“Sir, I — sir!” Kendy spilled it 
all, his voice shaking with fright 
and embarrassment and rage. 
“You don’t want to be expelled.” Mr. Smith closed his 
eyes. 
“No, sir. I want to stay here, 
sir. Yesterday, in our American 
Aspirations Seminar, you were 
saying one for all and all for one.” 
“Yeah,” Mr. Smith muttered. 
“I guess you’re the one.” He 
rolled off the bed, stumped across 
the floor to the closet, and shrug
175 
ged into a faded silken black and 
red robe with the white letters 
AIR-SEA RECON 3 embroidered across the shoulders above 
a downward-diving red-whiteand-blue dragon with its wings 
folded beside SCUBA tanks and 
swim fins. 
“What time?” Mr. Smith laced 
on his special shoes and looked 
up at his calendar clock. With 
one gray hand he slipped the 
whiskey bottle from the drawer 
into the deep pocket of his flambuoyant silk robe and grinned at 
himself in the mirror. “You superannuated old spook, we do 
the impossible.” 
As he faced Kendy, he looked 
oddly young again, and his smile 
thinned and died. “I hope they’re 
just putting you on for laughs. I 
hope that’s all.” 
They found Rog crawling in 
the hall. 
“Hold it, you big poker.” Mr. 
Smith frog-marched Rog back 
into the restroom and pushed him 
up against the tile wall. “You’re 
not faking. One pupil’s dilated. 
Who?” 
“Bedcheck,” Rog mumbled. 
“Gotta go to bed.” 
“You slipped and hit your head 
on this basin,” Mr. Smith said. 
“Drink this.” From the pocket of 
his robe, he hefted the sloshing 
brown fifth. He twisted out the 
cork. Like a gray octopus, his 
gloved hand squeezed Rog’s 
176 
throat below his paw so that His 
mouth opened. Mr. Smith poured 
it in while Rog gagged. 
“I thought you were our champion boozer?” Mr. Smith grunted. 
“No wonder you’ve been dizzy, 
Half-paralyzed. Stop drinking all 
this rot-gut. I’ll pour the rest into the basin, down the tubes. You 
can’t Handle Hard liquor any 
more, but I won’t say anything. 
I’ll cover for you if you’ll forget 
what happened. Forget it all. 
Don’t say anything. Don’t answer any questions. You’re so 
drunk you need a medical checkup after falling and hitting your 
head.” 
Between them they supported 
Rog, walking him along the hall 
to the elevator, to the dispensary 
and into the isolation room. “Lie 
down. Dream you have the measles. Kendy, find him a hospital 
gown.” 
\ fter a long time, Mr. Smith 
returned with the doctor. 
By now, Rog was able to control 
his right arm fairly well. During 
the encephalographic examination, his eye-pupils began to 
equalize. The doctor said he 
might have suffered a concussion 
and should be kept under observation for twenty-four hours. “Also, young man, with your encephalogram, stop this drinking 
before it’s too late.” 
Mr. Smith grinned. “Rog, you 
GALAXY 
know you could be expelled for 
boozing in a federal dormitory. 
We’ll keep our moutbs shut. You 
do the same.” 
The clock indicated 2 :42 A.M., 
and Kendy felt dizzy with weariness. He felt fragmented. He 
hoped Rog would be all right. 
Mr. Smith shrugged. “Let’s go 
for a walk. You know where?” 
“You think he’s still in there?” 
Kendy mumbled when they stood 
in front of the grillwork door to 
the Trophy Room. “It’s locked.” 
“You want a key?” Mr. Smith 
laughed. “I’ll tell you where the 
legal key to the Trophy Room is 
hanging in plain sight in the 
building superintendent’s office 
with a concealed camera aimed at 
it from the ceiling. I’m not going 
to try to steal for you. I don’t 
want to lose my pension.” 
“It’s a trap,” Kendy muttered, 
dimly realizing that such a simple 
key deliberately hung in plain 
sight had been an invitation to 
copy it. “Got to find Oliver and 
take his key away from him.” 
“If he’s not inside,” Mr. Smith 
said softly, hooking his gray fingers in the grillwork door to the 
Trophy Room. 
“My fingerprints are inside.” 
Kendy couldn’t understand 
why Mr. Smith kept smiling at 
the ceiling. At any moment, the 
night security guard might happen to look down this hall and 
catch them. Kendy looked back. 
KENDY'S WORLD 
He caught Mr. Smith grinning at 
the ceiling as if there were a surveillance lens up there. But the 
Hall seemed nothing but smooth 
surfaces except for the wastebasket on the floor. Kendy groped 
downward through paper cups 
and candy wrappers until he 
found the key. 
“You just improved your 
grade,” said Mr. Smith. 
Lacking gloves, Kendy used his 
handkerchief when he unlocked 
the doors to the Trophy Room. 
Mr. Smith grinned and clumped 
straight across the dark room to 
the light switch. 
|^vn top of the glass case lay the 
Czech Model 81 sub-mach’inegun, which Rog had been 
playing with. Kendy stared down 
at both lobotomizers lying on the 
floor. The wires of one lay twisted beside its battery where he’d 
entangled Oliver. The other was 
nearer the door. Beside Kendy’s 
foot gleamed droplets of blood as 
if Oliver had ended up with a 
bloody nose. “That crazy little 
idiot. I can’t understand why 
he would attack Rog. I thought 
he Hated me.” 
Frantically, Kendy began wiping off the lobotomizer he had 
handled. “Maybe Oliver’s still in 
the building, and he’s gone to get 
the security guard. Maybe he’s 
set a trap for me.” 
Mr. Smith had closed the steel 
178 
doors, and he had started polishing the glass cases with the sleeve 
of his robe. “If you luck out of 
this without being expelled, you 
will be older, maybe wiser. What 
a guy needs is a girl-friend. Understand?” 
“What?” Puzzled and wearyeyed, Kendy peered at Mr. Smith, 
who had picked up the little submachine gun. 
This late at night or early in 
the morning, Mr. Smith suddenly 
looked at least fifty years old and 
increasingly worried. “God! Five 
more years until my full pension, 
and I could blow it all for helping you. This is federal property. 
Breaking in here is a federal offense.” 
Mr. Smith abruptly returned 
the gun to its glass case. “I must 
be nuts helping you, risking my 
pension after spending my whole 
life from the age of seventeen in 
the service of my country. Two 
undeclared wars, wounded twice. 
That was nothing. Since then I’m 
one man who’s earned his pension. God, it was cold up there! 
Ever heard of Vorkuta? After 
two years I was exchanged for a 
covert Soviet agent who’d been 
framed for rape in Boston because he put his arm into a hollow tree. The micro-film already 
had been removed from that drop. 
Glorious exchange! I came back 
to the United States with no fingers. You don’t understand what 
I’m feeling, so Hurry up and let’s 
get out of here.” 
Mr. SmitK looked like a frightened old man. 
Kendy realized Mr. Smith Had 
been put out to pasture at National University. At that moment, Kendy felt both sorry for 
Mr. Smith and grateful to him. 
Mr. Smith’s gloved Hand closed 
on his shoulder and shoved him 
gently toward the door. Quietly 
they slipped out of the Trophy 
Room. 
“Lock the doors,” Mr. Smith 
whispered. “Start worrying about 
the key.” 
Kendy swayed, dizzy with weariness. He thought he should dispose of the key, not merely hide 
it. 
“ — to do about Oliver ... we 
go . our Squadron.” As if from 
a great distance Mr. Smith’s 
voice was saying : “ — a Serious 
talk about your future.” 
“Excuse me,” Kendy muttered, realizing he’d been clinging 
to Mr. Smith’s arm. “I guess I’ve 
got my share of — - emotional 
problems.” 
VII 
T>learily, he followed Mr. Smith 
-®~* through the sleeping darkness of Squadroom Nine, shuffling across the grass-like carpet 
beneath the glittering stars and 
into the conference room. From 
KENDY'S WORLD 
across the mahogany table, Mr. 
Smith reached to push the coffee 
burbler toward him, but Kendy 
shook his head. 
“I want to thank you.” Kendy felt choked by another surge 
of emotion. 
Mr. Smith’s aging face peered 
through’ the steam rising from a 
coffee cup. “Will you do me a 
favor?” 
“Gee, yes.” In that moment 
of sleepy gratitude, Kendy would 
have done anything for Him as 
if . Father, father! 
“Next year enroll as a freshman at U.S.C.” 
“What? What?” Kendy’s voice 
broke in disbelief and anguish. 
“You don’t want me Here?” 
“Don’t look like that. You can 
come back here after two years. 
We’ll send your scholastic records to the U.S.C. registrar — 
showing you were an honor graduate from an exclusive prep 
school which we subsidize near 
Palo Alto.” His gloved Hand 
reached across the table toward 
Kendy, and he tried to laugh. 
“On your prep school records, 
if you like, you can be shown 
as President of the student body.” 
“Of a high school which does 
not exist? What are you trying 
to do to me? First, you recruited 
me; now, are you flunking me 
out?” 
“We need you.” Mr. Smith’s 
smile shivered between aging 
1 79 
fright and youthful enthusiasm. 
“There are two important things 
we need you to do while you’re 
young enough to do them. The 
first is for practice. Like other colleges, the University of Southern 
California enjoys research contracts funded by the Defense Department. But here at National 
University, we have the most important contract. We test the security precautions at the other 
universities. You’ll enroll at 
U.S.C. and — ” 
“You want me to infiltrate 
U.S.C. ?“ Kendy blurted, his leg 
muscles tightening. “Like a spy.” 
4tQit down. You’ll simply be 
^ assigned one easy security 
problem to be completed during 
your first year. That’s how you 
are earning your tuition right 
now. Don’t get up. You Have a 
bigger problem right now. You 
are one of three students who 
broke into a federal security area, 
the Trophy Room. Rog’s recovering from an — accidental — 
mental overload and probably 
will be expelled for something 
else. Oliver seems to be in hiding, 
but possibly will be retained 
here and protected. You’re sitting 
here because I’m protecting you.” 
“I’m going home.” 
“If you did, there’d be an official investigation as to why you 
left. I couldn’t protect you. I’ll 
be arrested too, unless I cooper180 
ate with my superiors. Because 
you’re a minor, you’d probably 
be remanded to the security building of the California Youth Authority until you’re twenty-one. 
At thSt time, there’d be a federal 
court trial under security conditions. Unless the National 
Emergency has been repealed by 
then, you’d probably serve 10 to 
20 years as an adult.” 
“For what? For what?” 
“Obviously for breaking laws. 
With so many new laws, you 
break them by breathing. Ever 
since Congress declared the National Emergency, for nine years 
they’ve been passing more and 
more stringent laws, trying to 
keep the lid on. At least let me 
cover for you.” 
“You’re conning me,” Kenny 
cried, “not helping me. You waited like a — vulture for me to 
make a mistake, for me to break 
a law. I refuse to be a spy.” 
“That’s the wrong word.” Mr. 
Smith’s face flushed. “You won’t 
be a spy. You’re not qualified to 
be a spy. You’ll simply be a 
freshman who has been assigned 
to photograph a classified centrifuge. Because all this research 
is being sponsored by the government and paid for by the government, surely the government 
has an obligation to test the security procedures. If you complete your assignment, we’ll simply mail the photographs to the 
Chief Security Officer at U.S.C. 
along with an explanation of how 
you penetrated their security, so 
that he can make the necessary 
corrections.” 
“If I’m caught?” 
“We’ll notify the F.B.I. and 
the whole thing will be hushed up. 
Happens every day. This is necessary if we’re to maintain any 
security in this world. What a 
paradox! Fortunately, those brave 
men you mistakenly criticize and 
denigrate and mislabel as spies 
are much more skilled and intelligent and enlightened than you 
could ever be!” Mr. Smith seemed 
genuinely angry. “Intelligencegathering services are doing more 
to prevent war than diplomats 
It’s the intelligence-gathering 
services of all sides who are restraining the so-called statesmen 
from more miscalculations which 
could kill us all. How well I 
know! That’s why you’re alive today — ungratefully sneering at 
— spies.” 
“I wanted to be a diplomat — 
not a stinking spy.” 
'"T''his time Mr. Smith didn’t get 
angrier. He wearily smiled 
and said: “You’ll learn. You’re 
too Honest with yourself to be a 
diplomat in this world. Diplomats 
have to wear their heads twisted 
backward. They can’t negotiate 
realistically because they’re talking backward to impress their 
KENDY'S WORLD 
own people. But the people are 
confused and angry at everyone because the world’s too complicated for them to understand. 
That’s why the so-called democratization of Russia is increasing 
the threat of war. Their acrobatic diplomats are performing 
for their own people, who don’t 
know what they want. Ours are 
talking toward the American voters. So there’s less and less genuine face-to-face communication 
between the diplomats. In effect, 
they’re blindly bumping bottoms, 
while reciting to please their own 
people.” 
Mr. Smith managed to grin, 
tightening his jowls until he appeared thirtyish again. “Believe 
me. It’s the intelligence-gathering 
services who try to listen to what 
the other side really wants, what 
the other side is afraid of, what 
the other side can do. It’s the intelligence-gathering services on 
both sides who have been preventing miscalculations by the 
politicians. To prevent wars and 
riots, the intelligence-gathering 
services are beginning to enter the 
communications media, trying to 
modify public opinion. The intelligence-gathering services Have 
been trying to save us from chaos, 
while you wrinkle your nose at 
spies.” 
“You’ve conned me from the 
day you started recruiting me.” 
“Did I tell you to get mixed 
up with a slob like Rog?” Mr. 
Smith’s grin became infuriating. 
“And a potential little genius 
like — ” 
“No! You simply waited for me 
to fall into any trap.” 
“If you believe that,” Mr. 
Smith said, “consider it part of 
your education.” 
“You’ve screwed up my education. You changed my class 
schedule until biochem is the only 
significant course I have.” 
“You can become a biochemist 
if that’s the life you want. You 
will have the opportunity to learn 
lab techniques more advanced 
than any in the United States, 
because U.S.C. has just recruited 
an old fan from overseas who 
now calls himself Dr. Magadan 
Smyert. He was E. Vavilov’s 
teacher.” 
C t T t’s all got nothing to do with 
-*■ me,” Kendy cried, protesting everything, but reluctantly 
remembering that this Dr. Smyert, or whatever his name was, 
had escaped to the West a few 
weeks after Dr. E. Vavilov’s return from Phobos. This Dr. Smyert claimed to have no knowledge of why Lotka II never 
descended to Mars. He claimed 
he had been in Leningrad, working in a different administrative 
pigeon hole, where he had been 
relegated to planning simpler laboratory procedures which could 
182 
be taught to unskilled studenttechnicians. 
“Everything in the world has 
something to do with you.” Mr. 
Smith sighed and cautiously laid 
his gloved hand on Kendy’s 
shoulder. “I’ve saved you from 
being expelled, jailed or drafted. 
All I’m asking from you is a 
minimum of patriotism.” 
“Damn it,” Kendy cried shrilly, “my mother warned me about 
guys like you. You keep trying to 
con me.” 
“Your mother is a shrewd wo — • 
lady. I don’t understand your 
mother. She’s patriotic, too, in 
her own way. But she’s tangled in 
the past as she remembers it before the National Emergency. All 
the labels have been changed 
since then. She would have been 
called a liberal then. She’s considered a chaos-worshipper now. 
What does she want? A return 
to disorder in the streets?” 
“I’ll be damned if I understand 
what’s going on now,” Kendy 
muttered, swaying toward sleep 
again. 
“You will be damned,” Mr. 
Smith muttered, helping him up. 
“In the meantime, we struggle 
among ourselves. We can’t understand the noises from galactic space. We don’t even know 
why the Russians retreated from 
Phobos or what they’ve found on 
our Moon. They’ve drilled into 
something under that plastic 
dome.” His voice grew more tired. 
“We don’t know why they retreated from PHobos as if they 
were afraid. They’ve managed to 
maintain such superb security. 
We can’t get near E. Vavilov. You 
claim it’s got nothing to do with 
you. Listen, kid, any new knowledge is like the sharp edge of a 
weapon emerging. It will have a 
lot to do with us all.” 
He pushed, and Kendy tottered out of the conference room, into the darkness of the squadroom, 
under the artificial stars, crossing 
the grassy carpet toward his stall, 
with Mr. Smith pushing him. 
“A few hours sleep,” Mr. Smith 
whispered, “and you’ll know I’m 
right.” 
“About what?” Kendy mumbled. “U.S.C.’s only one. You said 
two. What’s the other thing I’m 
supposed to do?” 
“They didn’t tell me.” 
Kendy collapsed within the 
framework of his bed and rolled 
on to his back in an agony of exhaustion beyond sleep. Alone beneath the star-spangled false sky 
he felt empty grief. “Not my father.” He stared at the rising 
Moon in the glass sky. “Nobody.” 
Blinking at a red star, He thought 
it shouldn’t be so close. As his 
eyes opened and shut and opened, it seemed to move like a 
planet ■ — like Mars. 
When he closed his eyes against 
it, he saw a bright speck separating from it and enlarging toward Earth like a rocket, and He 
knew he was dreaming. He opened his eyes, He thought, and saw 
the immensity of the galaxy and 
beyond. 
In the morning, He woke smiling and ready to face the universe. “Nobody’s going to con 
me!” —HAYDEN HOWARD

KENDY'S WORLD 
Qalamf 
by ALGIS BUDRYS 
Tt occurs to me that we’ve be-*■ come overly concerned witH 
what is “best,” or with what is 
“significant.” We’ve become 
trend-spotters, in this field, to 
such an extent that we’ve bowed 
to the consequent pressure to 
make trends out of the flimsiest 
pretexts, or to raise up resistance 
to trends just as if they were ob
J 
jectively real. This cannot be 
good. 
And yet it’s natural. There is 
both the constant human motivation to isolate excellence (as a 
means of striving toward it), and 
there is our heritage from those 
first brave days in the latter 1940’s 
when the earlier serious sf anthologists were searching out and 
reprinting stories that were, indeed, the best of the accumulated 
literature. 
Nothing at all like that situation exists today. In some cases, 
“best” stories are selected, nominated, anthologized and given 
awards before thei average reader 
has ever heard of them, let alone 
read them. In some cases, by 
the time he gets around to reading them, next year’s crop is already undergoing the same swift 
process. The reader’s voice and 
opinion are considered valuable, 
of course — it’s simply a shame 
that they are so often behind the 
trend. Similarly, when an editor 
is slothful enough or prestigious 
enough not to jump into the annual trending contest at the first 
crack of the gun, he or she often 
makes up for this by selecting 
from sources so esoteric that the 
normal reader cannot begin to 
perceive whether even better examples might not lie neglected 
in darker corners of those same 
distant granaries. The acceptance 
of the best becomes a matter of 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 
a somewhat different sort of 
faith, but in either case what the 
reader is asked to do is to believe in a given editor or editorial 
panel; to accept the judgment of 
mere mortals in a situation so 
complex and so swiftly unfolded 
that only angels might confidently dance within its permutations. 
Orbit 3, edited by Damon 
Knight for Putnam, at $4.95, for 
instance, is billed as “The Best 
All New Sf Stories of the Year.” 
It happens to contain some remarkable work. But if it Is to be 
credited for that, then it must 
also be faulted for not saying 
“ ... as selected by one man who 
didn’t see everything, doesn’t 
have time to read everything, 
can’t pay in competition with 1 all 
markets ...” etc., or, more simply, “ ... as selected by one 
man.” 
Don’t get me wrong, as the 
poet says. On any number of 
levels of abstraction, one cannot 
blame a commercial enterprise 
for making a commercial noise. 
But some day we shall be a little bit diminished by this plethora of pottage, and you know 
it, and I know it, and I just! Happen to be weeping a little in advance of the rest. 
Having gone through all that, 
it’s a pleasure to say that Richard 
Wilson’s best story ever, to my 
knowledge, is in this book. “Mother to The World” is simply beau
185 
tiful; a last-couple-in-the-world 
story which makes its points 
with unprecedented majesty because its author had the goodness, 
humanity and wisdom to say simply what many other writer have 
feverishly said in the now great 
number of years since we began 
admtting that Earthmen, as well 
as BEMs, were justifiied in desiring Earthwomen. 
Yet the remaining stories are 
nowhere near as good as other, 
similar stories by these same writers. It may be true, but it seems 
hardly credible, that they themselves failed or will fail to do 
better within these 365 days. It 
is unbelievable that no one did 
better. 
Nothing about this book could 
justify the high per-word price 
tag except the “best” tag. The latter is unjustified in fact, and so 
is the other; in the reprint paperback market, something like this 
relationship will then recur on 
its own scale, for the publisher 
will surely plaster the jacket with’ 
even more outrageous blurbs, 
there being a law about the weight 
of the adjectives being inversely 
proportional to the success of the 
editor’s project. 
There are those who find it 
relevent to say the editor doesn’t 
write the jacket copy. Neither 
does the B-girl own the saloon. 
And there are those who say 
“Wait, next year’s will be better,” 
186 
to which one can fairly reply with 
the comment that the present volume, then, is not only based on 
no reference to either the past 
or present, but is foredamned by 
the future. 
“Once And Future Tales” collected from F&SF by its editor, 
Edward L. Femian, is published by that brave enterprise, Harris-Wolfe 85 Co., at $5.95. And 
with an introduction by Judith 
Merril. (Some day, when I die, 
I will find myself standing on an 
underline between two parentheses. A mighty voice will thunder: 
“Budrys, prepare to meet thy 
Maker!”, but just before I step 
forward onto the lava, seme hovering assistant imp will lisp : 
“first, an introduction 
Be that as it will be, Once and 
Future Tales contains, besides a 
dull chapter from Judy’s memoirs, Thomas Burnett Swann’s 
“The Manor of Roses,” Theodore 
Sturgeon’s “When You Care, 
When You Love,” William Tenn’s 
“The Masculine Revolt,” Rosel 
George Brown’s “Fruiting Body,” 
and “End of The Line” by Chad 
Oliver, along with several other 
stories you. need not concern 
yourself about, they being imitations of bad stories. 
I read this book principally because of “The Manor of Roses,” 
which is accompanied by a stunning jacket painting, promising 
much on the story’s behalf. (The 
rationale goes that if the story 
got this kind of response out of 
its illustrator, it must have something direct and concrete in it). 
And “The Manor of Roses” is 
indeed an interesting story. Wrapped in the style of an historical 
romance set in England of the 
Middle Ages, the adventure it 
unfolds to its young protagonists 
are based on the supposition that 
mandrakes really were a problem 
in those days; that within certain 
limits there were times when you 
couldn’t tell whether a person 
was animal or vegetable. Beyond 
that, the story endows the vegetable people with the terrible ambivalent need to either be adopted as humans, so that they may 
retain human softness and guise, 
or to take horrid revenges after 
they coarsen into creaking fibrous 
denizens of the soil. 
Swann has created a story capable of the full range of human 
concern, from rough-and-tumble 
to deadly peril, from innocent 
chaffering to dewy romance, from 
theft to pathos. It’s a shame he 
went beyond this, by framing it 
with a beautifully written but 
patly plotted, and totally superfluous, incidental story leading 
up to the “shock” ending I suppose he thought he needed to go 
out on. Whoever and wherever 
he is, he should know he was doing just fine until he tried to 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 
do his own editorial thinking. 
“The Masculinist Revolt” is 
William Tenn in one of his discursive moods, simply telling the 
political history of the Masculinist party, from its inception at the 
hands of a codpiece-maker to its 
effective doom when Shepherd 
Mibs fired the shot that pierced 
the cheeks of Elvis Borax. And indeed, every word rings true, true, 
and mostly funny. All the inventions are inventions of detail, 
mind you — the central notion, 
that men might rebel against the 
increasing matriarchy of the 
U.S.A., is not new and was not 
new when people began applying 
it to, say, Nineveh. The inventions sometimes either flag or 
overextend themselves, almost 
certainly because Tenn had already told the story to his friends 
so many times that he was deathly bored with precisely its earliest and most outstanding ideas by 
the time he got to the typewriter. 
There is no particular reason for 
this story, except that Tenn was 
equipped to summarize the dynamics of political action and 
also is fully capable of generating 
absurdities, with great verisimiliture ad infinitum from any standing start he cares to demonstrate. 
“When You Care, When You 
Love” is the Sturgeon of recent 
days, concerned with how the creations of his youth might work 
out in practice. This is a story 
which begins by depicting a love 
of fantastic intensity, with such 
conviction that one might well 
weep for its lack in oneself. Then 
it goes on to explore a means 
whereby sufficient desire and sufficient dedication might bring one 
of the lovers back from death. 
The entire rationale there is not 
only science fictional, it’s brilliantly so. But having reached 
this difficult and often elusive 
point — which is the point a 
writer is interested in — Sturgeon 
lacks the energy to resolve the 
story properly for his reader. He 
has carried all his characterizations and prose structures remarkably well along the platinum thread of his narrative. He 
has for instance first taught us 
some science, then extrapolated 
it, then related it to overwhelming 
human emotion, which he also 
describes beautifully. He sets it 
down, pleased with himself, then 
recalls his audience, looks up, 
waves his hand at the componenents, and says: “There it is, 
folks,” with a winning smile. 
Sturgeon deserves to smile like 
a winner. But the reader deserves 
to be brought to the point of saying to himself, on his own behalf, “Here it is!” and the author should keep mum. Sturgeon 
knows that; he taught it to us. A 
facile structure of words, tacked 
on to counterfeit an objective 
meaning to everything that’s hap188 
pened to his characters heretofore, remains a structure of words, 
not of events, and as Sturgeon 
also knows, it’s events that are 
life. Words are merely the best 
present tool we have to grapple 
life with. 
What I am saying about this 
book and these stories is that 
they’re self-conscious. For one 
reason or another, this book, like 
any of these stories, does not act 
as a catalyst to the imagination. 
Instead, it seeks the approval of 
the intellect. Seeks it well, seeks 
it winningly, but should it? 
Should we all be so damned selfconscious? 
A young writer — Bob Shaw is 
a young writer, whereas, say, Algis Budrys, who is approximately 
the same age, is an old writer — 
should do what Bob Shaw has 
been doing; working his way 
through' stories. He should not 
think much about what he is doing, or why, or if he does he 
should not take up the reader’s 
time with evidences of these 
purely personal concerns. The 
reader has paid his money and 
demonstrated a certain willingness, but it is not a willingness to 
have the writer move in with him. 
Unless he be working for a specified audience of people who are 
interested in various aspects of 
his technique — that is, unless 
he be teaching the craft — to 
people who have in some manner 
paid tuition fees, as distinguished 
from the great number who buy 
tickets to stories, he has to distort 
both himself and those who deal 
with him, or else he has to be distorted by them, each time he does 
anything but present his story as 
distinguished from himself. 
These are not statements of my 
opinion; they are statements of 
fact, and I hate to keep harping 
on them, especially since I then 
find my opinions quoted favorably by people who think you can 
legislate creativity, almost as often as I find them attacked by 
people who believe literary criticism is a branch of press- agentry. 
But I must harp on them in cases 
where they explain, first of all, 
talented but somehow less satisfactory writers. 
The general quality is most often called by the term “storytelling ability,” and it has now 
gotten so scarce, in the minds of 
some people, that even a curmudgeon like Lester del Rey, who 
really knows better, is moved to 
give him overblown praise on the 
covers of a merely adequate 
novel. 
Only Keith Laumer, of all those 
pressed into service as shills by 
Terry Carr, speaks an undeniable 
truth about The Two-Timers, an 
Ace Science Fiction Special. 
“Smoothly written, immensely 
readable,” he says correctly. 
GALAXY BOOKSHELF 
“Painfully good,” says Harlan 
Ellison. “A damned fine book,” 
says Lester. 
No. No. It is a reasonably well 
told narrative about a man who 
wants so much to bring the dead 
back into his arms that he succeeds in crossing time, where he 
does indeed find his beloved — 
in his own arms, he being still 
married to her in that parallel 
world. 
Shaw brings to this intensely 
workable situation all the range 
of his sympathy for the human 
detail — the beloved who is not 
wholly lovable, the hero who is 
just sufficiently flawed, the villain with the fatal seeds of heroism in him. But he makes serious 
mistakes, and one can see them. 
Some of them are mistakes of 
detail, apparently stemming from 
the error of deciding to set this 
book in Montana. Not for one 
minute can anyone seriously believe that Shaw has seen Montana, or a Lincoln sedan, or an 
American policeman, a park in 
a city of the western U.S.A., a 
suburban house, a lakeside cottage in the Rockies, or any of 
those other things he names here 
in this book, while actually describing something that probably 
is in fact Manchester. He has 
never heard an American talk, or 
if he has, he very properly refused 
to believe it. 
The sub-notion of warping of 
the entire universe by the passage 
of one body out of it, and the 
warping of another by the passage of a body into it, is just so 
much barnacle. Not that Jack’s 
passage into John’s world might 
not somehow have such an effect, 
so that the Earth spins farther 
away from the Sun, the Sun flies 
off at a tangent, and the entire 
universe begins to run like a 
cheap stocking. But this seems 
hardly likely, and one doesn’t 
even need to bring in Continuous 
Creation as a hypothesis that 
would permit Jack to thrash 
about in perfect physical freedom; all it means is that somewhere one has to pack a few hydrogen atoms a little bit closer 
together in some interstellar gas 
cloud tens of tens of tens of thousands of cubic light-years in extent. More important, what has 
it to do, really, with’ Jack and 
you and me? 
It’s a rather good story, and I 
recommend it. But Shaw is trembling on the verge of teaching 
himself to edit, to inject the commercial thing, to introduce the 
visible signs of conscious effort. 
Jack and you and me are the 
same in Manchester as Montana; 
love is all, ennobling and destroying; the universes within the soul 
totter sufficiently loud so that we 
may usually leave God’s handiwork undisturbed. I will admit to 
being impressed with Shaw’s tal190 
ent to the extent that I’ll swallow | 
his hypothetical time travel via § 
migraine headache. What the hell. | 
But I’m not impressed with it to 
the extent that I feel it outweighs , 
the importance of the author. By 
plastering this book over with 
praise, the editor has preconditioned the audience response. 
Since the book is not that good 
— and I can’t believe Terry Carr 
thinks it’s that good — he has 
deliberately preconditioned it toward distortion. By lending themselves to the extravagant praise 
Terry wanted to have, del Rey 
and Ellison Have participated in 
a situation based on some consideration other than objective 
appraisal. Ellison loves to write 
critical phrases like “The writing 
is exquisite. It knocked me 
cold ...” because there’s a definite charm to writing like that. 
Del Rey loves a good story and 
nurtures storytellers. But he can’t 
really Have “finished with a feeling of complete satisfaction.” 
Come on. If you praise a mediocre book, because you want to 
sell more copies, or because you 
like writing blurb copy, or because you sincerely believe the 
writer deserves good things, what 
you are doing is helping to perpetuate the book’s errors. You 
stand in danger of encouraging 
a writer you like to inject cosmic 
sf elements t into a human story, 
to that story’s inevitable diminu
GALAXY 
tion of impact. You stand in danger of encouraging a man to think 
of gimmicks, of driving him directly into the arms of a seductive 
way of life in which things are 
made so pleasantly flattering 
that one loses the guts to actually 
put out any unusual work.The 
process is plain to see, and always 
has been. And where it starts, 
and who it starts with, is not in 
the obviously sycophantic and 
ponderous extravagances that every interesting new writer encounters and can recognize; it 
starts with the well-intentioned 
distortions of those he respects 
and who often wish him well.

At the 1968 Boskone (short for "Boston Science Fiction Conference"), 
the guest of honor was Larry Niven, and his speech was a technological 
evaluation of the phenomenon of teleportation — not so much whether it 
exists or not as an examination into the engineering aspects of it, if it exists 
at all. We heard the speech, and liked it well enough to ask Niven to go 
into the subject more deeply in the form of an article for Galaxy. Which 
he did. The result, entitled The Theory and Practice of Teleportation, will 
be in our next issue. 
After all, even a psi phenomenon must somehow or other come into 
contact with the conservative, relativistic universe of known physical law. 
Conservation of momentum, for example: What happens if you teleport 
out of a speeding car? Conservation of energy: If you teleport from the 
top of a mountain to a valley, where does the potential energy of the 
change in height go? Good questions; and Niven has some pretty good 
answers for them as you'll see next month. 
At the same time you'll be seeing the first installment of a new Keith 
Laumer novel (and, in our estimation, his best yet) And Now They Wake. 
A handsome and talented lady named Anne McCaffrey, proud in the 
possession of the first Hugo ever won by a female science-fiction writer, 
is with us with The Weather on Welladay. And if we squeeze if in, we 
hope to have an unusual novelette by a mathematician entitled Godel 
Numbers. What's a Godel Number? Well, for one thing it is a way of 
conveying any message — any message at all — by writing down a single 
(admittedly rather large) number, whether the message is "Dad, send cash" 
or the Encyclopedia Britannica. 
See you then.

A Igis Budrys became a fan of 
science fiction wbile Ke was 
working on a chicken farm and 
going to High school in New Jersey. If that sounds like the story 
of a young American farm boy, 
tKe implication is tHe complete 
opposite of tKe truth. His background is urban and international. He was the son of the late 
Lithuanian Consul GeneraLin exile to the United States, which 
made Him a resident alien. But 
even if Ke had been an American 
citizen, he would have been unable to vote when his first story 
was published in 1952 — because 
he was too young. Nevertheless, 
this story and others by Kim that 
soon began appearing were remarkable for their mature approach to the goals and aspirations of the coming age of space 
in America. Some of Kis background does show in his novels, 
however. THe Falling Torch depicts the complexities and confusion of real diplomacy in exile; 
and Who? is a speculative psychological novel against a coldwar situation that is convincing 
and excellent in detail. 
Except for Kis brief early farm
ing experience, all of Kis work has 
been connected with some aspect 
of writing or publishing. He worked as an editorial assistant on 
Galaxy Magazine under Horace 
L. Gold. After getting more editorial experience at a small book 
publishing firm, he returned to 
free-lance writing. He moved to 
Chicago when he was offered the 
position of chief editor for Regency Books. As editor there, Ke 
was busy encouraging other authors to write science fiction for 
him while he was busy doing a 
difficult political biography — 
his first serious venture into nonfiction. When Regency Books became inactive, he transferred to 
the staff of Playboy. 
At present, lie is engaged in 
public relations work, mixing that 
type of writing with critical work 
for his regular Galaxy Bookshelf 
column. He and his wife, Edna, 
share a house in Evanston, 111., 
with their four handsome and active sons. Most of his free time 
is spent pedalling around on a 
ten-speed bicycle, often accompanied by one or more of the 
boys. When he talks of the wonders of technology, it’s hard to 
192 
tell whether he’s discussing a new 
rocket booster or the virtues of 
some obscure bicycle part. Fortunately, he still finds time to 
turn out an occasional piece of 
fiction. 
J ames Blish is a man who seems 
to be a complete contrast 
to himself in almost every way. 
A few years ago, he rode to work 
on a high-powered motor scooter, 
scowling out from a helmet and 
goggles at the stupidity of motorists around him. Then he 
would doff the helmet, put on his 
conservative Homburg, and appear as any rising young business 
executive. 
As a critic, he can be both the 
least patient and most patient 
of human beings. Some of his 
critical essays (under the name 
of William Atheling, Jr., or his 
own name) were so savagely insistent upon a high level of craftsman ship that several writers were 
afraid to write again. Yet at the 
Milford Workshop sessions each 
year, he is the most patient encouraging of teachers, gentle as he 
pinpoints an error and quick to 
recognize any sign of talent. He 
has a persistent tremor to his 
hands, and his smile seems diffident. But when an argument 
starts, he’s in there with tooth 
and claw, and the smile is suddenly that of a tiger about to 
make a killing. 
As a writer, he has covered the 
field of fiction more thoroughly 
than most — from pure hack 
sport stories to science fiction 
that is acclaimed for its philosophical daring and technical excellence. He has no use for psi 
stories; yet his Jack of Eagles was 
perhaps the wildest and best-explained of all wild talent novels. 
His Okie stories were worked out 
with exemplary realism — yet 
the final story, The Triumph of 
Time, wound up in a blaze of 
universe-destroying and multiuniverse creation; he likes his 
stories to be tied up neatly at the 
end — and yet that novel left a 
dozen questions to tantalize the 
reader. His Case of Conscience 
used space travel as a background 
to examine an ancient problem 
of heresy on Earth — and won 
him a Hugo for the best novel 
of 1959. 
At present, he’s living in an 
apartment in New York City with 
three cats and a wife; the wife 
is the artist, Judith Ann Lawrence, whose work has so well illustrated many of Robert Silverberg’s fact books. They’re 
planing to move to England some 
time in 1969, where Jim will be 
able to devote full time to his 
writing. Hopefully, that should 
increase his already high output 
of excellent fiction, and bring us 
still more James Blish stories. 
( continued from page 8) 
no more than an abstraction of 
a real thing; in the process of abstracting, kinds of meaning were 
inevitably lost; the Laputan would 
converse only by pointing to real 
objects, pretty much limiting his 
conversation to nouns and verbs 
and not too many of them. Dean 
Swift invented this particular 
loonie as a satire against some 
primitive semanticists, and what 
he meant us to understand from it 
is true: we can’t operate without 
some kind of abstractions in communication, and it’s silly to attempt to avoid them. 
But it’s worth" while to try to 
remember now and then what the 
abstractions mean. Especially 
when we play the game of polar 
opposites: Sure, all numbers are 
either odd or even; but does that 
imply there is really anything 
that odd numbers have in common apart from the fact that 
they are not even? Sure, some nations practice what we know as 
democracy and others do not; but 
does that mean that all of those 
which don’t are natural allies of 
each other? Or enemies of those 
which do? 
Perhaps those implications can 
be shown to be so in fact . 
but How seldom we try to test 
them; and How often we find ourselves acting on conclusions that 
result only from words. 
T¥7liich is a long way from 
’ ’ where we started this editorial. Getting back to number 
theory, we would like to acknowledge that our particular thoughts 
on this subject at this time were 
sparked by a first-rate new book 
called An Adventurer’s Guide to 
Number Theory by Richard 
Friedberg (McGraw-Hill). 
Over the years, we’ve discovered some interesting correspondences between number theory and 
science fiction. One is that in 
both cases people respond vigorously; they are turned on, or 
turned off, but in either case 
decisively. 
If you are one of those who 
are repelled by discussions of 
numbers, forget it; this book isn’t 
for you. But if the subject interests you, the book will delight 
you. Friedberg explains and illustrates as He goes along, and the 
result can fill a good many Hours. 
If you chance to find yourself 
as a member of the crew of a 
long-orbit space voyage, this book 
and something to scribble on is 
guaranteed to keep you occupied 
as long as you like; you’ll still 
be trying to prove Fermat’s last 
theorem, or to understand why 
the sum of the first n odd numbers is always n 2 by the time the 
rings of Saturn heave into view.
