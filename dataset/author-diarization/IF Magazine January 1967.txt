“We’re looking for people 
who want to write” 



By Gordon Carroll 

Director, Famous Writers School. Former 
editor. Reader's Digest, Time, Inc., Coronet 

If you want to write, my colleagues and 
I would like to test your writing aptitude. 
We’ll help you find out if you can be 
trained to become a successful writer. 

Several years ago, we started the 
Famous Writers School. Our aim was to 
help qualified people acquire the skills 
they need to break into print. We poured 
everything we knew about writing into 
a new kind of professional training 
course, which you take at home and in 
your free time. After a solid grounding 
in fundamentals, you get advanced train- 
ing in the specialty of your choice— Fic- 
tion, Non-Fiction, Advertising or Busi- 
ness Writing. 

Each of your writing assignments is 
examined by instructors who are them- 
selves professional writers or editors. 
Your instructor spends up to two hours 
analyzing your work. He blue-pencils 
corrections right on it — much as an 
editor does with established writers. 
Then he returns it to you with a long 
personal letter of advice and specific 
recommendations. 

This training works well. Our students 
have sold their writing to more than 100 



publications including Reader s Digest, 
True, Redhook. 

Stephen Novak of Wayne, N. J., says, 
“I just received a check from Ellery 
Queen's Mystery Magazine. That’s 1 1 
stories sold in six months.” Doris Steb- 
bins of S. Coventry, Conn., who has sold 
six stories to Woman's Day for $2,050 
writes, “Taking your Course has made 
it all possible.” 

Writing Aptitude Test offered 

To find out if you can benefit from this 
training, send for the School’s Aptitude 
Test. If you test well, or offer other evi- 
dence of writing ability you may enroll. 
But there is no obligation to do so.

H. G. WELLS PLUS 100 



A hundred years ago this week 
(as this is written) H. G. Wells 
was born. As it happens, this is 
being written in Wells’s own city of 
London, and the newspai)ers and 
the television are full of him. Pil- 
grims have come from all over the 
world to celebrate his centenary; 
we spent part of yesterday with a 
visiting professor from Moscow, 
comparing recollections of Martian 
heat-rays and the Morlocks; speak- 
ers have praised him from France, 
Italy, Germany and, of course, the 
U.S.A. 

The England that Wells was born 
into was Queen Victoria’s England, 
complete with chimney-pots, pea- 
soup fogs and hansom cabs. It was 
the same England in which Karl 
Marx had been impelled to write 
Das Kapital (just a block or so 
from where we sit at this moment, 
in the reading room of the British 
Museum), a country of dreadful in- 
fant mortality and — as Wells him- 
self put it — a chronic, nasty smell 
of drains. Country folk still tugged 
at their forelocks as the gentry 
passed by, and the lot of the indus- 
trial poor was far worse. It was 
also a country of learning and wit, 
where the world’s most imiHwing 
Empire was ruled. 

To Herbert Wells the boy, and to 
young Wells the assistant draper’s 



clerk. England must have seemed 
like the world and the world must 
have seemed a confusing place. Here 
were great railway engines and 
powerful ships. Here were clangor- 
ous factories and mines; an army 
and navy that ruled half the world, 
and a commerce that controlled 
much of the rest. And who were 
the Titans who populated this small, 
mighty island? They were Wells’s 
own people, not quite poor but never 
really secure, living in dark, dingy, 
‘‘respectable” homes, never entire- 
ly clean, never entirely well, never 
without fear. 

From these beginnings Wells 
looked into the future. What could 
he possibly see there? 

First he saw disasters — the 
brutal, destructive war of The War 
in the Air and The Land Ironclads, 
He saw the money-driven life of 
When the Sleeper WakeSy a Vic- 
torian England raised a couple of 
magnitudes, where the poor were 
witless animals and the handful of 
rich were empty-headed, purpose- 
less gods. He saw that final extra- 
polation of Marx’s class struggle, 
the world of The Time Machine, 
where the workers, so long con- 
demned to sweat and ignorance, 
lived in caverns below the earth and 
the butterfly descendants of the 
rich fluttered about the landscaped

surface . and at nigfht the Mor- 
locks emerged from their ventila- 
tion tubes, and hunted the graceful 
little Eloi, and killed them, and ate 
them. 

What Wells saw for the future 
was, in fact, what he saw around 
him in the real world, but more 
so. It was an ugly sight, and he 
did his best to blot it out with his 
Utopias. We needn’t come to this, 
he cried; if we use our hearts and 
brains — and pay close attention 
to the Socialist principles of the 
Fabian Society — we can come 
to a time of peace and freedom and 
love, where we all wear togas, write 
poems and do eurythmy all day 
long. 

W hat is wrong with Wells’s 
Utopias is that they don’t 
really sound like very much fun 
for the long pull. They are the sort 
of place that would be great to 
visit, but you wouldn’t really want 
to live there. 

To tell the truth, this is not a 
problem that is unique to Wells. 
Nearly all science-fiction writers, 
the ones in this magazine included, 
have pretty consistently shown 
themselves to be better at warning 
of pitfalls than at painting rosy 
pictures of goals we can aim to- 
ward. 

Question for the class: Is it possi- 
ble that this is the way things 
ought to be? Is it possible that, 
considering the million possible 
branching pathways toward the 
endless number of futures the 
world might attain, it is mere use- 
ful to have a guide that tells us 
which paths to avoid rather than 
one which encourages us to go that 
way or this*l 

Because the record of human be- 



ings who get what they think they 
want is not very encouraging. For 
example^ <wibat would Wells himself 
have thoujglKt of this particular 
segment of his future that we are 
living in today? By any objective 
standards, he should have liked it 
very much indeed: there’s plenty of 
soap and quite a lot of food; equali- 
ty of opportunity for all is at least 
in sight, if not actually here; the 
world’s governments may not be 
exactly socialist, but they’re a long, 
long way from being Victorian- 
capitalist, too. 

Yet we who are actually living 
through his centennial year can 
testify that it isn’t quite Utopia, 
after all. Antibiotics may have made 
us all healthy, but they haven’t 
made us all good; and if our houses 
don’t smell bad any more, our rivers 
do. 

Perhaps, like children, we just 
haven’t yet made up our minds 
what we want to be when we grew 
up. Perhaps we are in the adol- 
escence of the race — gangling and 
bumptious, full of ferments and 
drives, as strong as an adult but 
not quite as wise . but unable 
to know that that is so, since we 
are wiser now than we ever were 
before, and consequently cannot 
imagine some day becoming wiser 
still. 

Perhaps the lesson that most 
needs learning is that we — the 
collective “we”, meaning all of man- 
kind — can invent for ourselves 
whatever kind of future we want. 
Granted that we can’t describe it 
exactly at the moment; nevertheless, 
we can at least see the icebergs 
looming in our path, and we can 
turn away from them in time to 
avoid being sunk. 

Apart from pleasure — the brain- 

IF 



6 




pleasure of stretching one’s mind 
and the gut-pleasure of high ad- 
venture in space — that’s what 
science fiction is all about. It gives 
we brave few who read it a sort 
of extra eye. We may not see clearly, 
but we do see something; while most 
men trudge along without ever rais- 
ing their eyes from the ground. 

A nd so we do honor H. G. Wells 
for having helped to shape and 
define science fiction. We owe ham 
a great deal. If today’s writers 
sometimes see a little better than he 
it is perhaps because they have 
learned from his mistakes, the mis- 
takes of a man of genius, working 
at his best. For Wells’s science fic- 
tion was Wells at his best. He wrote 
any number of ^‘mainstream” novels, 
and they were well received and 
widely read; but who reads them 
now? Why should anyone read them 
now? And he wrote non-fiction, too 
— but the best of it, his Outline of 



History t is really a sort of science- 
fiction piece in reverse: in it Wells 
played the sf game of extrapolation 
just as in his stories, but he worked 
it from the other end, with real 
causes and real events. 

We wonder what Wells would 
have made of the world if he had 
started a century later; what would 
he have written for us if his child- 
hood had included TV, the IBM 
7094 and the DC-8? 

He would have written fine stor- 
ies, no doubt, and quite different 
from The War of the Worlds and 
Men Like Gods in detail. But we 
think that the overall message 
would have been the same. H. G. 
Wells’s stories all had a single 
moral, after all, and we doubt that 
that would have changed. What he 
would say to us now is what he 
said to us then: “It is time Men 
stopped suffering like animals, and 
began to suffer like Men.”

R ippled like red ocean bottom, 
each ripple inked in violet shad- 
ow from the setting sun, the low 
dunes rolled in their journey to 
the edges of the world. Those ^ges 
stood high and cruel. The eastern 



horizon was blue-black below a 
flaring long arc of eaten rust whose 
ends sank out of sight far to the 
right and left. Occasional nearer 
masses of orange rock glowed their 
sunward faces against the shadow 
beneath the edge. Above it, tiny 
flecks of unwavering light were 



8 



stabbing themselves through the 
black windings of creation. 

Toward that horizon the Amsir 
sped, its clawed, padded feet mak- 
ing thumps and hisses among the 
ripples as they kicked. Topping each 
rise, the Amsir emerged from 
thickening shadow and, like the 
rocks, glowed briefly before; un- 
like the rocks, it had cavorted down 
out of sight to pop up again on 
the next rise. It was half a dozen 
feet tall and gripped a javelin 
across its chest with the little hands 
that grew halfway down its wings. 

Honor White Jackson was chas- 
ing it and had a different opinion, 
but the Amsir was beautiful. Its 
beaked face was all angles and 
slits, and it had great, translucent 
flightless wings extended for balance. 
Graceful as a goblin bride, it cur- 
vetted in a flutter of lacy pennons 
growing from the horn of its puffed- 
up body and its spindled lower 
limbs. These made good insulation 
for Amsirs at rest and were also 
quite useful to the humans of the 
Iron Thorn. Their effect now was 
to make a shy wonder of the beast; 
a pale, tossing creature that soared 
in on skittish, pK)ssibly joyous, quick 
steps. 

The wings, spanning twelve-odd 
feet from nail-hard tip to tip, glowed 
pale coral in the waning sunlight 
and were excellent for infuriatingly 
shrewd changes in direction. Many 
times as he ran after it. White Jack- 
son had changed over to his cast- 
ing stride, the brutal glass-^headed 
dart nocked in the socket of his 
Amsir^bone throwing stick. Just as 
often, the Amsir had tossed up one 



shoulder in a motion fraught with 
disdain, pivotted around the resist- 
ance of the fifteen square feet of 
braking surface, and been off again 
on a slightly altered tack. Behind 
the slitted round turrets of horn 
in which its eyes were veiled, glit- 
tering pupils twinkled back over its 
shoulders. 

A s they traced their paired tracks 
of magenta dust over the great 
desert. White Jackson and the Amsir 
together made a certain beauty 
greater than their individual own. 
Jackson was thinnish, long limbed, 
tall and burned brown. Like the 
Amsir, he had a lean face and glit- 
tering eyes. Like die Amsir, he ran 
daintily, touching the surface just 
long enough to gain traction for his 
next stride, striving not to come 
down flat-foot. He wore a very old, 
bright metal cap with a pointed 
spike and a new chinstrap made of 
Amsir-lace. He bad a h^f pint of 
water in an Amsir-bubble strapped 
to the small of his back, and car- 
ried his spare dart in his left arm- 
pit. As wiry and as taut as the 
Amsir was ethereal to the eye, he 
was very much aware that this 
whole scene depended on a suspi- 
cious sloth in the quarry just as 
much as it did on the Honor’s en- 
ergy. 

White Jackson was also aware that 
the Amsir’s exasperating jigs and 
jags had a common baseline which 
was leading him steadily away from 
the safety of the Iron TTiom. The 
damned bird was trying to lure him. 
White Jackson was new to being 
a Honor, and if this was the sort

of thing he could expect to have 
happening in his chosen way of life, 
he wanted very much to investigate 
it while he was still young enough to 
learn. Accordingly, though he now 
and then came down on his soles in 
the jolting, slower bounds designed 
to transfer momentum to his pois- 
ed throwing stick, he intended noth- 
ing more for his pains than what he 
got — a series of sharp nudges of 
his cap’s rim against his scalp. He 
saw no reason to doubt that he was 
tougher and smarter than any Am- 
sir or man in the world. If he 
wasn’t, now was none too soon to 
learn about it. He was content to 
keep running all day — barring one 
limitation he couldn’t help — and 
he expected the Amsir would spring 
his trap whenever it was dark 
enough for it. He was even willing 
to help him spring it, if it was 
what he suspected it was. 

As they ran on, playing their 
charade on each other, the Amsir 
undoubtedly had its own motives 
for being where it was. Jackson was 
thinking that if he brought in the 
Amsir, his brother Black would 
treat him one way, and another if 
he did not. Though his brother was 
always very good to him. He was 
thintog that it would be pleasant 
to sit down to the community table 
with the demeanor of one who has 
killed what is being eaten. He 
imagined this would have its effect 
on women, and might go some dis- 
tance toward getting elders off his 
back. But all this was colored by 
the simple joy of being tirelessly 
strong and a Honor — his people 
pronounced it with the “H”, as 



“Hahn-er” — in a world bounded 
by sand and Amsirs, populated most- 
ly by dvdl fanmers, and centered on 
the Thom to which the farmers 
clung. 

He looked over his shoulder to 
locate the Thorn. He had gotten 
very far away from it. Only the top 
several dozen feet of its black silhou- 
ette were visible over the horuxm. 
There was no doubt that if he lost 
his cap now, there would be a few 
very bad moments of death for him, 
and danmed little else. 

What puzzled him was that the 
Amsir was not giving him enough 
credit for intelligence. 

H onor White Jackson, even more 
than the wise old farmers who 
knew better than to want anything 
off beyond the fields, had a clear 
understanding that it was bad to 
get out of sigjit of the Thom. It 
was also bad to go beyond the 
perimeter of the fields without a 
cap. The proposition about the cap 
had been proved to him by his 
brother, who took him to the desert 
and took his cap off. The air around 
White Jackson had instantly turned 
into thirsty burning ice. The sun 
had become a pale, cold hammer 
that left his skin itchy for hours 
after the cap was clapped back on 
his head, and would have blackened 
his frozen corpse given the chance. 
The proposition about never get- 
ting out of sight of the Thorn, cap 
or no, Jackson took on faith ir 
Black’s word as an established pro- 
fessional Honor. There were alsc 
the elders, of course, who knew 
so bloody much that only their con- 

IF 



10 




stant open-mouthedoess prevented 
its running out iHieir ears. And 
there were the dders’ women, whose 
job in life seemed to lie in telling 
girls all sorts of useM tips about 
how tricky life was. 

With all this information being 
passed around the humans since 
time began with the creation of the 
•Thorn, it was inconceivable that the 
Amsirs hadn’t deduced how much 
of it was true and how much of 
it the humans believed enough to 
act on. The Amsirs after all had been 
in the desert beyond the fields since 
time began, and had seen many 
a farmer turn his plough, and many 
a Honor popping up from his night- 
laid ambush in a dune. 

The story was that the world 
hadn’t been made for Amsirs; Am- 
sirs had been made for the world. 
Either way, it was surely no world 
for men, and men could be pre- 
sumed to know it. Therefore, thou^t 
White Jackson as he skimmed across 
the sand, with faint swirls in the 
space immediately around him as 
if the air were water about to 
produce its first bubbles before boil- 
ing, what was the Amsir’s plan? Did 
it honestly expect him to follow it 
over the Thom’s horizon and drop 
dead for its benefit? That seemed 
to be the idea. 

It really did. Having seen an 
Amsir get away from an ambush 
and carefully maintain half-speed 
with all the appearance of going 
full out. White Jackson was pre- 
pared to believe there was more to 
honning Amsirs than had ever been 
spelled out for him. A while ago, 
the beast had started working him 



around behind one of the rare rock 
outcroppings, and Jackson had beeii 
ready to expect three or four more 
Amsirs. But nothing like that was 
happening. The shallow arc of their 
course was now far beyond the 
spongy up-thrust of bloody orange 
rock, and just ibeginning to curve 
in behind it. Their distance from 
the rock gave him a clear field to 
see that he and the treacherous bird 
were the only two live things work- 
ing here. 

All right. They were as far from 
the Thom as Honor White Jackson 
cared to go. He was going to have 
to nigiht-walk back to the Thorn, 
solving the navigation by reversing 
his memories of every change in 
direction and every stage of distance 
he had covered since leaving it. He 
was, hopefully, going to have to 
do it with the Amsir’s eighty pounds 
across his shoulders, and he was 
about ready to start. In another 
eight stritte, he was going to 
stumble, lose his stick and dart, 
paw at his face and try to crawl 
back along his track, for all the 
world as if the Amsir had lured 
him over the horizon. If the bird 
didn’t go for it, that was just too 
bad. If he did, he was due for 
Jackson’s spare dart right in the 
throat. 

But it was only three strides be- 
fore the world was cold and his 
throat was full of splinters. He had 
been moving forward at a pace that 
covered twelve feet per second, com- 
fortable and planning ahead, and 
now he was flailing forward, in- 
capable of stopping until he fell, 
or doing anything but trying to 



THE IRON THORN 



11 




squeeze breath out of the breath- 
less air. He thought his eyeballs 
would freeze. He searched indig- 
namtly for the sight of the Thom, 
and he couldn’t believe that you 
actually had to see it; he couldn’t 
understand why, if you were still 
inside the Thom’s horizon, an out- 
cropping of red rock between you 
and it was the same as losing your 
cap. Black Jackson had never said 
a word about that, and neither had 
anyone else. 

And now that damned Amsir 
was turning around. 



T he , Amsir came in like fury. 

Nothing in the world mov^ 
faster than one of its kind when 
it wanted to, and it wanted Honor 
White Jackson very soon. Its wings 
were flung up like a hook for each 
moon. The javelin was caught half- 
way up the haft in the bereft little 
right hand that grew where the wing 
folded in mid-span, thumb and all 
three fingers making a bony fist. It 
was gathering speed as it ran, and 
its strides were growing longer jmd 
more urgent. It was almost as near 
to flying as it could get. The javdin 
was stabbing straight up and down 
— the wings were folding into 
leathery cups for the thin air, and 
beating with a rattling thrum that 
raised wakes of dust beside its 
springing knees. Now White Jackson 
could see its full face — the de- 
lighted grin of its beak, the adrena- 
lin-exalation of its eyes. Its talons 
diuokled through the sand. 

Jackson almost didn’t care. He 



knew what it was — it was the cold 
and the choking that were making 
him all concerned with what went 
on inside. After Black had showed 
him the trick with the cap, he had 
thought for a long time about what 
had happened, and although several 
old women had told him it was a 
kind of sunstroke and perhaps im- 
piety’s simple reward, he had de- 
cided it was cold and lack of air. 
Sudden lack of air, that caught a 
man halfway into drawing a breath 
and having his heart nearly stop 
with fear when an everyday useful 
action suddenly got you nothing but 
savage disappointment. He had no- 
ticed that people who got bad news 
on a beautiful day were more apt 
to go around with ttieir eyes pop- 
ping, grabbing at their hair and 
sobbing, than those who got it on 
a gloomy one. Summertime tragedy 
was always louder and more indig- 
nant. So he could understand why 
his body wanted to double over on 
itself and his hands wanted to 
beat on his throat. 

He had tried it out, getting one 
of the neighbor kids to hit him in 
the stomach, and it had been a 
feeling a lot like that; no cold or 
burning in the eyes and nose, but 
the same helplessness to make his 
body do anything it didn’t want to 
until the spasm had passed and he 
could begin to pant. He guessed if 
he thought about it long enough, 
he could reason it out about the 
cold, too, and the thing that made 
bloody paper of the insides of 
his nostrils. Maybe even test it. 
But the Amsir was coming on. White 
Jackson’s stick and dart were ly-

ing away on the sand just as if he’d 
thrown them deliberately, and he 
was dying. 

In spite of all reasoning and re- 
hearsal, he would have been help- 
less if he hadn’t already been plan- 
ning to fake this same thing. He 
had no air — no air at all, and you 
can’t go long with not trying to 
breathe if your lungs are empty, 
even if you know there’s no air 
around you any more. But he had 
that other dart, and as he folded 
he got a hand up to his armpit 
with a very natural motion. The 
Amsir had reached him. It was up 
in the air, at the height of a great 
leap, bucket-winged, and he couldn’t 
understand why it wasn’t flirting 
those feet like knived clubs, ready 
to shred him up as it came down. 
He would have been. But it was up 
there, falling at him from a height 
of its own length. Now the ends 
of the wings were tucked down and 
back, and the hand with the javelin 
was bent to aim. The gleaming 
metal point was going to hit the 
sand right in front of his eyes, 
and the Amsir shrieked “Yield! 
Yield!” 

W hite Jackson only looked like 
he was all in a heap on his 
knees and chest, with his face in 
the sand and his eyes rolling up 
sideways. He had the dart in the 
hand under his body, point sticking 
out of the bottom of his fist for 
more punch. “Yield, damp thing!” 
the Amsir shrieked as White got his 
open hand on its ankle, which was 
hard like a cockroach. 

There was a lot of noise and 



flurrying, and, Jackson had the Am- 
sir down on the sand at this levei. 
He jerked himself across the body, 
whi^ was hard the same way aiKl 
wrapped in flapping stuff, and he 
was himself wrapped in wings and 
fingernails with his head down be- 
tween his shoulders as far as it 
could go, with the beak carving 
him. It was punch through the side 
of the Amsir’s throat and through 
the spinal cord, and a feeling like 
a stick coming back out through 
a jabbed parchment window, and 
then, for the life of him, punch 
through the Amsir’s chest and into a 
bubble — one of the two big, main 
ones down inside there imder all that 
horn and stuff — and hug the Am- 
sir with all the affection in the 
world, mouth to the chest-hole, and 
breathe in, in of the Amsir’s air. 

The Amsir flopped and flailed, 
wings drumming, legs dancing, back 
arching, but White Jackson stayed 
with it. The stuff coming out of the 
Amsir was hot with life and puffed 
like hollering; he had to lock his 
throat against its pressure when he 
had his lungs full. He couldn’t 
move his head, for his mouth was 
the only stopper he had to save 
it with. 

And he didn’t have to breathe; 
he didn’t have to breathe! He could 
go on doing this forever. It was 
altogether different from being out 
of air. It was being free of having 
to breathe like the Honors he had 
seen dancing around the Thorn with 
the bubbles from their fresh kills, 
dancing all night, hey, and gulp- 
ing the Amsir-wind from the bub- 
bles, but never breathing, just blow- 



THE IRON THORN 



13 




ing out once in every while and 
mouthing the disembodied parts of 
Amsir chest again, laughing and 
moving like the dead were said to 
whoop with joy on Ariwol. 

The Amsir’s body was dying now. 
Its head might be dead, or it might 
live forever, but who could tell when 
nothing but skin connected it to 
the body and it had no wind to 
shriek with. The eyes were shut. 
There was something thick and clear 
seeping out between the closed lids 
and drying immediately to a crust. 
The wingtips were still quivering. 
But Honor White Jackson was a 
hell of a lot more alive than it was, 
and he picked it up. Staggering, and 
grinning as much as he could, he 
stumbled quickly to the javelin, his 
throwing stick and his darts, the one 
far away and the other near to hand 
with fresh gouges up the short Am- 
sir-bone shaft. He got them clustered 
into his hands with his arms around 
the Amsir, and then he wandered 
out from beyond the outcropping’s 
shadow, still cold but not caring, 
riotous as a tickled child, happy on 
pure oxygen, with his first Amsir 
like the world’s most awkward buck- 
et of cool water on a blazing day. 

W hen he had rested for a long 
time in the cool sand, watch- 
ing nebulae and moons wheel by 
beautifully without his knowing what 
they were, he raised himself on one 
elbow and fondly stroked the Am- 
sir’s long thigh as it lay sprawled 
beside him. 

The hunting bird, wings folded, 
was only a dim, coverletted shape. 
But Honor White Jackson could 



have named every curled rim of 
horn, every trailing pennon, every 
nail, every tooth. He unfastened 
the trimmed and harnessed water 
bubble at the small of his back, 
unstoppered it and raised it to the 
corpse before sipping from it him- 
self. As his neck and back muscles 
stretched, sand cracked free from 
his wounds and tickled him as it 
slipped down his spine. He grinned 
at the Amsir and patted its hip. He 
stood up, hooked and tied his gear 
into place and oriented himself to 
the shadow of the outcropping 
against the stars. 

Now that he knew where he 
was, he could go where he had 
been. And now that he was stand- 
ing up, he could no longer hear 
thuds of approaching Amsir feet, 
if there were any such in his vicinity. 
So he must go. Stooping, he hefted 
his first conquest, eased it down 
across his shoulders and began a 
steady, fast and comfortable walk, 
broken with pauses for listening 
closely and looking around as well 
as he could. Amsirs did not seem to 
move much at night — hence the 
Honor tactic of slipping away from 
the Thorn at dusk and picking a 
good ambush in the morning. But 
Honor White Jackson was more 
than ever in an iconoclastic mood, 
and he wondered why, if Amsirs did 
not haunt the darkness, so many 
of those ambushes failed. 

His grip on his slain enemy was 
needlessly rigid. He knew that, 
but he did not slacken it. He could 
carry him more easily if he relaxed, 
but he did not do that, either. 

Nobody had told him Amsirs 

IF 



14 




could talk. Nobody had told him 
they carried metal spears, or any 
other kind of weapon but claws, 
beak, and wingtips. He had been 
told — as all children of the Thom 
were told even before most of 
them drifted into farming and a 
very few tried to be Honors — that 
the Amsirs would get them all if 
the Honors did not watch out. But 
he had not been told how they 
would be gotten. 

He would not let his Amsir go. 
He thought it was because he had 
had to learn so much to get him. 

The gritty, sharp-faced grains of 
sand made noises like gentle screams 
beneath his trudging feet. The Am- 
sir rustled and rattled. It was full 
of ridges and pointed places that 
goaded White Jackson’s flesh. The 
wings were full of joints along the 
main bone. It was conventional to 
speak of the hand as growing out 
of the elbow, but in fact there was 
a joint between shoulder and hand, 
and the remainder of the wing was 
supported by what would have been 
a monstrously long little finger in 
a man. No matter how Jackson 
folded the wings and tried to tuck 
them into each other or pin them 
under the Amsir’s hard chest, the 
nail at the end of that little finger 
on one wingtip or the other would 
flop down and swing teasingly 
across his ankles as he walked. He 
put the Amsir down and trussed 
it with its own lace. Now it was 
a rolling bundle on his back, stiff 
and contrary. 

An edge on it found the deepest 
place Jackson was cut — a beak- 
furrow across the top of his shoul- 



der, its edges stiff and gaping, crusty 
dry with sand, open down to the 
rubbery, twist-surfaced muscle. 
Jackson was fascinated with the cut 
— it was unusual to be able to 
touch his own inside, to dwell on 
the thought that if he were not 
a victorious Honor he would be 
wincing pitifully. He understood 
perfectly well that all men would 
rather not put their flesh in peril. 
He knew from himself that even a 
small hurt could nag a man with 
reminders of why this was wise. But 
he had noticed that it wasn’t the size 
of the wound, it was his feeling for 
himself that made a man cry or 
not, and that was why he had be- 
come a Honor. Now he was a Honor 
who would have a white Amsir-beak 
scar across one broad shoulder; a 
Honor who put his Amsir down 
from time to time and stretched out 
on the sand beside him, ear in the 
grit listening, with the stars and 
small moons giving him little to 
light his night with, and going back 
to the Thorn where he would live 
differently from before. 

Ill 

I t was very nearly dawn when he 
caught the loom of the Thorn 
against the low stars. At the same 
time, he noticed a human step on 
the sand. He thought it might be 
Black Jackson coming toward him 
around the shoulder of a dune. 

The way it was supposed to go, a 
Honor was discovered sitting beside 
his kill on the sun side of the Thom 
when the people got up in the 
morning. Successful Honors had 



THE IRON THORN 



15 




been knawn to stay out on the edge 
of the desert ah night even when 
they didn’t have to. People who 
accidentally came across a Honor 
before dawn pretended the man 
didn’t have a carcass across his 
back. The idea was to have an 
effect that it had all just somehow 
happened, like a meteorite shower. 
The Honor was supposed to play 
it very cool, too, and not notice 
anybody was paying any attention 
to him — at least until there was 
enough of an audience for him to 
suddenly break out in a big happi- 
ness. 

All that guff got more comment 
than it did attention. It seemed to 
be a hangover from some time may- 
be half a dozen generations back 
when some nut had whipped up a 
lot of pious ritual. The trouble with 
any of diis stuff that was supposed 
to make life better and more in- 
teresting was that the life plain 
never did get any better, and a 
man still had to find his own in- 
terests. After a while even a com- 
munity of farmers could notice that. 
So White had half expected, 
especially on his first kill, that a 
live one like Black Jackson would 
be around to give him a personal 
handshake or something before dis- 
covering him all over again in the 
morning. To say nothing of the 
fact that just maybe, even though 
it wasn’t like a Honor was sup- 
posed to be, Black might be wor- 
ried. 

The Amsir was suddenly begin- 
ning to get that characteristic smell 
Jackson had studied from boy- 
hood. He pulled his cap off cau- 



tiously, and sure enough he was 
inside the comfortable radius, even 
if it was still very much like desert 
underfoot and breathing took a 
little work in the chill air. It was 
a lot farther out than the farmers 
cared to come. Farther in, there 
would be a good four dozen feet 
of weedy grass around the peri- 
meter before the fields began. Win- 
ters that strip shrank to something 
that was still wider than two dozen. 
For a part of the year, when the 
days were long and the high sun 
beat down sharply on the glisten- 
ing gridwork atop the Thorn, the 
strip might be close to five. The 
fields never crept out into it. A 
farmer. White Jackson had de- 
cided early, was anybody who would 
scheme nights to ^ge an inch off 
his nei^bor’s boundary but wouldn’t 
reach for a free clear title to all 
Ariwol if he’d ever cut his finger 
on an edge bf parchment. 

I t was Black Jackson, tall and with 
muscle around his stomach and 
waist that White Jackson envied the 
hell out of, his short hair marking 
him as a Honor. His bare face show- 
ed up as a paler patch against the 
dark contrast of his mouth and eye- 
pits. White stopped, but didn’t let 
the Amsir slide to the ground, and 
stood easily. 

“Welcome, Honor,” Black said. 
There was something unusually 
breathy in his big rumble of a voice, 
which for many years White had 
been thinking of as friendly. He 
came forward and touched White on 
the shoulder — the sound one, as 
it happened. Although it was still 



16 



IF 




pretty nearly full dark, at this dis- ' 
tance White could see the sober set 
of Black’s broad mouth. This was 
beginning to relax as Black touch- 
ed the Amsir; White had noticed 
long ago that people believed only 
what they touched — the rest they 
believed conditionally, on the testi- 
mony of people who claimed to 
have touched. “You all right, kid?” 
Black touched him again. 

“Uh-huh.” 

“Well. Well, you got one, didn’t 
you? And you’re okay.” Black was 
walking around him, displaying 
more and more of a species of re- 
lief, studying the Amsir, poking 
the carcass. “Young one,” he said, 
appraising the callous on the pads 
of its feet with a rasp of his thumb. 
He had been carrying his dart and 
stick. He put these down and looked 
at White. “Give you trouble?” 

White shrugged. 

Black had found the javelin 
across White’s shoulders under the 
Amsir’s body. It slid easily into his 
hands. “Ck)me at you with this, did 
he?” 

“Uh-huh.” 

Black’s glance came up fast from 
under his lowered brows. “Say any- 
thing?” 

“Nothing much.” 

“What did he say?” 

“Something about how he had 
me, I guess. I was busy. And he 
called me a damp thing.” 

“Any more?” 

“No. I killed him about then.” 

Black bent to examine the Am- 
sir’s neck. He fingered the edges 
of the dart punch. “Nice work. 
Caught him clean.” 



“Well, that’s how Black Jackson 
taught me.” 

“Kid?” 

“Yeah?” 

“Feels good, doesn’t it?” Black 
Jackson was grinning. Whether he 
knew it or not, he looked more like 
he was remembering than he did 
like he was enjoying now. And it 
looked as if he was working hard 
to remember. “Going out there, get- 
ting your first one . finding out 
just how tough you are?” 

“You mean it felt good for you 
when you did it.” 

“Well, yeah; Yeah, kid. I remem- 
ber how — ” 

“How tough am I, Black?” 

“I don’t follow you.” 

“I mean, you’re the one that’s 
happy about what I found out. Do 
you know what I found out?” 

“Well, sure. I Look, I didn’t 

hoild it against anybody that didn’t 
tell me Amsirs had spears and could 
talk!” 

W hite Jackson had been think- 
about this ever since the first 
screech out of the Amsir’s mouth. 
But he had never seen his brother 
this way before. He studied Black 
as closely as he had studied the 
Amsir who had taken off from the 
blown ambush but hadn’t really tried 
to outrun him. “I figured maybe 
we could pass a few words about it.” 
He was thinking about a dirowing 
spear that had at least as much 
range as a Honor’s dart, and an 
Amsir who hadn’t pulled out to a 
safe distance and then picked him 
off, hadn’t stood and fought until 
he was ready.

“Ppint -is, you didu’t need to be 
told, did you? Got him aayhow, 
right?” Black had the javdin head 
down in the sand beside his foot, 
and was leaning on it. That way, 
it looked like a stick of some kind 
and not much of a weapon. “And I 
told you they were tricky. Remem- 
ber?” he afterthought. 

“Uh-huh.” He held tighter to his 
Amsir. He believed this was be- 
cause he had a stupid feeling Black 
might try to take it away. He be- 
lieved he had the stupid feeling be- 
cause he had suddenly realized 
Black wasn’t going to give the spear 
back. He waited for Black to say 
something. It was Black who ob- 
viously knew what was going to 
happen here next. 

“Well, ain’t it something to go 
out against something that’s that 
tough, and come back carrying it?” 
“It’s something.” 

Black was wrapping and imwrap- 
ping his thick fingers around the 
javelin’s shaft. The sharp metal 
head gritted down, sinking deeper. 
“It gives you the feel of being a 
man, right?” 

“It gives me the feeling of some- 
thing. I was a man before I went 
out jthere,” White said. 

His brother tapped him lightly, 
awkwardly with his clenched fist, 
this time on his. bad shoulder. He 
couldn’t see it was bad. “You al- 
ways were tough. Never gave an 
inch. I always had the feeling you’d 
cut me down just as soon as one 
of those kids you used to bloody 
up. If I v/asn’t your brother, I 
mean. And bigger, I guess.” 
This was not the view White had 



of bimself through his brother’s 
eyes. And this wasn’t the talk he 
had expected. It was teaching him 
a lot more about Black than it was 
about Amsir--hunting, and he didn’t 
want to 'be taught any more about 
his brother. He had been peifeotiy 
satisfied with what he had 
lieved up to now. 

“Black, it’s getting on to first 
light,” White said softly. “I have 
to go sit by the Thorn. Come mid- 
morning, the Eld Honor’s got to 
look over my Amsir, see it’s real, 
call me a Honor, chop my hair, 
name a winning man to shave me; 
that’d be you, I guess. Be a busy 
day for both of us. Why don’t we 
just call me a made Honor for 
now and let me pick up any other 
tricks of the trade as I go along?” 

A foot of the javelin’s length was 
buried in the ground. It oc- 
curred to White that Black only 
had a third of a dozen feet to go 
before he had it out of sight. “No, 
look — Kid, it could of been some- 
body else waiting here to meet you. 
We all get met the first time. It’s 
— hell, you can see it’s necessary. 
But it could have been Red Filson 
or Black Harrison or one of those 
guys. It didn’t have to be me. But 
I trained you. Same way I was 
trained; we all get trained the same 
way. When you get back, you see 
the good in tha — ” 

“If you get back.” 

**You? Hell, I knew you*d come 
back!” 

“Sure.” 

“Well, I figured you had a good 
chance.” Black twisted the javdin; 



THE IRON THORN 



19 




White couldn’t decide whether he 
was really trying to huiy it lig^t 
here or whether he was so wirapp^ 
up in his words that he wasn't even 
thinking about his hands. A trait 
like that could get a Honor killed. 
White had to assume it was rare. 

''Good chance,” Black said. 

“All right,” White said, feeling 
the cracks in his lips where the 
edges of the Amsir’s chest wound 
had cut them. 

“Listen, kid, there’s a lot of things 
to growing up beside;3 getting your 
hair chopped!” White noted that 
Black was getting angry in the same 
way as when somebody refused to 
believe it about the caps. “You 
think we’re gonna let a bunch of 
punk kids — even Honor kids — 
run around tellin’ the farmers all 
about what it takes to be a Honor? 
You think those farmers don’t all 
believe they could be Honors if 
they could spare the time? You 
think it don’t make a difference to 
a Honor, taking a piece of a farm- 
er’s loaf, to know he couldn’t be?” 

“Because he’s a Honor who got 
back from his first time.” 

“That’s right. Now you’re get- 
tin’ it. It ain’t what you’re taught 
— it’s what you are that makes a 
Honor!” Black looked proudly across 
at his brother, at a man whom he 
could consider a man like 'him- 
self. He jerked the spear out of the 
ground and brandished it. “Because 
you went up against thhr 

That, and talk from animals, and 
caps that didn’t work, and brothers 
who spent years getting you ready 
for the night they lurked to check 
you out on the way back in. White 



Jackson looked at this powerful 
simpleton who had raised him. He 
didn’t know whether he was sup- 
posed to swallow this line because he 
was dumb enough to believe it or 
because Black was dumb enough to 
believe it. Either way, Black was 
not the man White had thought him, 
and in that case what brains did 
White have to brag about? 

4 4 A 11 alight. I’ve got it.” 

Black looked at him sidelong 
in the growing grayness. “You sure, 
kid?” He was begging for the right 
answers. He was being very gruff 
and tough about it, but he was 
begging. White guessed that in his 
own simple way. Black loved him, 
was sweating out the culmination of 
years in which he had prepared the 
greatest gift in his estimation. “I 
mean, you’re not going to say any- 
thing different, are you? I want 
you to be sure in your own mind 
you’re not going to pop off to the 
people until you’ve had a chance 
to talk to the Eld Honor about it. 
Lots of times, the Eld Honors can 
explain it all in a minute or two. 
Explain it a hell of a lot better than 
I can, that’s for sure,” he realized. 

White shook his head. “I’m gonna 
play it the way every new Honor 
plays it. I’m going to tell a story 
about ambushing him and having 
a hell of a fight and winning out in 
the end, and that’s all.” 

“You sure?” 

“You’re damned right I’m sure.” 

Black began to sigh with relief, 
but White was mad at him now, 
and wasn’t going to let him off 
the hook.

“Now you can tell the Eld Honor 
something for me. You tdl him 
I want to know about a metal spear 
even an Amsir can throw farther 
than I can flip a dart. Hell, a human 
could throw it eight dozen yards into 
an eye, and just how many of ’em do 
we have cached away? I want to 
know why my hat didn’t work when 
I was behind a rock. I want to know 
about Amsirs that talk. You tell 
him for me I think he’s got rotten 
brains for letting a brother come 
out to talk to me. You’re so shook 
up I could take you — even if I 
wasn’t expecting you to try for me.” 
He finished slowly. “You got that 
last part all sorted out, Black? I 
do. I got it sorted out fine about 
a Honor out here with weapons but 
no hat. There’s only a couple of 
things a Honor could kill out here 
with that rig. One of them’s poor 
slob Honors trying’ to crawl back 
v/ith spearholes in ’em that couldn’t 
be explained, and the other one’s 
young Honors that won’t shut up 
about what kind of people we’re 
sharing creation with. On the short 
end of the share. Now you just go 
take that spear and put it wherever 
all the other spears are; I’m not 
gonna go around upsetting the Hon- 
or racket, especially now I made 
my way into it, but don’t you mess 
me around until I’m over this.” 

He swung away, and his Amsir 
rattled on his shoulders, smelling 
like hell. He realized he was sim- 
ple for giving Black so many ex- 
cuses to just give that spear a little 
toss in the name of whatever Black 
thought was decent. But whenever he 
got mad and didn’t show it, he was 



always, crying sick inside for days. 
He figured if he just kept walking 
away from his brother who loved 
him, he had an even chance for get- 
ting off. 

IV 

I t was warm and pleasant in the 
sun. He sat cross-legged with his 
back against the warm black-and- 
brown flank of the Thom. His eyes 
were slitted into the sunrise, and 
he was only a little bit conscious of 
the people filtering out of die low 
cement buildings around the Thorn, 
on the other side of the clear space 
that ran a couple of dozen yards 
wide around it and was a dozen 
times a dozen dozen yards long from 
start to start. 

Red Filson, long-legged and look- 
ing like he knew everything about 
anything — from the scar that 
lifted his mouth and the corner of 
his left eye — was running a 
group of young Honor-types around 
it. As they went by White Jackson, 
bare feet thudding first in his right 
ear and then in his left, the young 
ones rolled their eyes sideward at the 
Amsir sprawled, spread-winged, be- 
side him. Filson, sunbleached lank 
blond hair all spiky with sweat, just 
grinned his grinless grin and kept 
eating up the ground with 'his feet, 
with that smooth, scissoring mo- 
tion that had run down a lot of 
things. One of the things had been 
Black Olson, White’s father, with 
his throwing arm stabbed through 
at the elbow and his eyes blinded 
from a cut across the brows. 

A thing White was supposed to 



THE IRON THORN 



21 




be mojoed by was the worry that 
between a running father and farm- 
er mother no Jackson could stand 
up with Red Filson. White wasn’t 
ready to swear what went on in 
Black Johnson’s mind, with all its 
sidesteps, but as for \^ite, he had 
noticed long ago he wasn’t either 
his mother or his father. He sat 
smiling faintly into the sun, his arms 
dangling over his thighs, as the class 
went on by in its circuit, the young 
ones sweating and grunting, Red 
sweating and grinning. White was 
thinking that being strung out mad 
about being mojoed would be a 
handy excuse if he ever decided 
there was something he didn’t want 
to share with Honor Red Filson. 

The sun did feel good. Now that 
he was sitting down and didn’t have 
to do anything but, wait for other 
people to do things. White could 
let himself feel sleepy. And he was 
where he had spent a lot of time 
wanting to be. 

Up against the Thorn, feeling its 
pitted warm surface comfortably 
rough against his back, the sweet- 
ish scent of the Amsir rising around 
him, he could turn loose of things 
he had^held tight for a long time. 
Gazing through his lashes at the 
half-focused sight of the green fields 
and orchards beyond the houses, get- 
ting the shadows of gathering people 
moving across the comers of his 
eyes, listening to them talking to 
each other — it sounded like a 
cross between things crackling far 
away and a mumble like the sound 
of whatever it was that went on in- 
side the Thom — a man felt as 
good as a baby in his crib. His back 



was safe, and nobody in front could 
do anything to him right now. A 
lot of them would never dare do 
anything any time from now on, 
just because he had killed some- 
thing and was short-haired. The rest 
of them would think long and hard 
about messing around a Honor’s 
goods or women. The idea was Hon- 
ors looked out for each other. It 
worked out they did look out for 
each other when it was between Hon- 
or and farmer, so from now on 
there wouldn’t be a farmer or even 
a Honor-type who would buck him 
to his face, and damned few who 
would go for his back, even when 
they had a good chance. 

H e had really messed up that 
Amsir, too. Given him one hell 
of a shock, with all the plans notch- 
ing into each other in that horned 
brain, and the damp thing lying 
there helpless, and all of a sud — 
What was it like to die. White 
wondered. Get cut off like that, in 
the middle of being alive, in the 
middle of thinking you had it made. 
Did you have time to know you 
were a chump? And just suppose 
there was an Ariwol, and you were 
human and that had happened to 
you, and you turned up with all 
that being a chump mnning around 
inside you. Yeah, sure, everybody 
running around laughing and sing- 
ing, feast going on all the time, but 
man the ones who hadn’t died 
chumpy would have an extra laugh 
for you, and all the chumps would 
try to buddy up. Thing to do was 
not go to Ariwol being a chump. 
But that was a tricky idea to live 



22 



IF 




up to, because sure as there was 
sand in creation that Ancksir hadn’t 
thought he was being a chump, he 
had thought he was on top right up 
to punch! 

Well, how could the Amsir know 
White Jackson had watched the 

Honors around the Thorn with 

their fresh bubbles? How could he 
know White Jackson would remem- 
ber that, would trust that, wouldn’t 
try to breath what couldn’t be 
breathed, would wait for what his 
enemy had to give him? Was it being 
a chump to be happy when your 
plan worked out? 

It was when you didn’t know all 
about what it was supposed to 

work against, White Jackson decided. 

There were more people gather- 
ing around him. Just standing there, 
with their farmer tools in their 
hands, the women with their water 
buckets, the kids . farmers not 
going out, women not lining up at 
the taps in the side of the Thorn, 
kids playing Honor behind the 

crowd, hanging on to grownup legs 
up front. 

What do they know? White Jack- 
son thought to himself, watching the 
sun, smelling his Amsir, letting him- 
self notice his shoulder and his 
other cuts just enough to remind 
himself. All they see is me and a 
dead one. No. All they see is the 
outsides of the two of us. What 
do they know about what we found 
out? And if they had been there 
and watched us do it, would they 
know any more? Touch me — any 
one of you, touch me or touch him, 
and you’ll find out the last thing 
there is. How’s about it, you muck- 



ers? Anybody want to ride to Ari- 
wol on the end of a dart this morn- 
ing? 

Filson and his candidates came 
round the Thorn again, Filson in 
front now, not running sweat but 
with a nice all-over bead worked 
up, the candidates pale as lace and 
soaking wet, their eyes blind. 

They were one less. Somebody 
had turned farmer after all, lying 
sucking wind somewhere around the 
curve of the Thorn with dirt in 
his mouth and water in his eyes. 
White Jackson thought about that 
scar on there; Filson had come 
back from his first hon with that 
on him; Filson knew. 

White wanted to grin at him as 
he went by. But he wouldn’t have 
known if he was really getting an 
answer. 

P etra Jovans came walking up to 
the edge of the crowd, making 
a little space around herself as 
usual, and stood there with her 
hands folded in front of her hips 
just looking at him with all that 
quiet in her eyes. What do you 
know? White Jackson thought, test- 
ing it on her, and then he wished 
he knew the things she knew. He 
wondered if the things he knew 
were big or little when you thought 
about them her way. 

He wondered whether it would 
be with her that he exercised some 
of his new rights *as Honor Secon 
Black Jackson. 

If not with her then with some- 
body else. Then sooner or later a 
son would be old enough to name 
and the people would Icam his own

name was Jim. Then someday he’d 
leave off honning and he Honor 
Gray Jackson, and mayhe there’d 
be a Honor Jimson or a fanner 
named Petras to scatter his bones 
and maybe not, but somebody’d 
scatter ’em, that was sure, because 
they did it out of grief or any- 
thing else they felt, but the idea 
was to make damn sure that the old 
man was dead. 

Sitting there, looking at it that 
way. White Jackson could see that 
if he was lucky enough to have all 
of this happen without any ugly 
interruptions out in the desert, it 
was still a short damn list of im- 
portant things left to have happen 
in his life. 

It came to him he’d spent a lot 
of years running around the Thorn 
and pitching darts to come to the 
moment he realized it was all down- 
hill from here on. But it was all 
downhill. When he thought of all 
the people he’d seen follow that 
road, and the way they did it be- 
cause they’d all heard the elders 
telling them and telling them how 
to do it. White Jackson realized 
that the track to Ariwol was beaten 
many times as hard as the track 
around the Thorn. 

What do you know? he thought 
to all the people. I could die sitting 
here, all punched out inside like Red 
Thompson was diat time last year. 
When the first anybody knew was 
when the Eld Honor touched him 
and he fell over just as stiff as his 
Amsir. I could be doing that, and 
when you found out you’d say. 
Oh hell, what a shame. But when I 
get up in a minute you’ll make all 



kinds of noises except that. And 
just the same I’m dying. 1 wish 
to hell there was a puddle of blood 
under me. You’d say the right thing 
then. What do you know? 

Petra had drifted into the crowd 
in such a way that she was right 
in his line of vision. Because he 
was thinking that she knew if any- 
body knew that he was as dead this 
minute as the farmers had been 
from birth. He winked at her. He 
realized he was getting a little crazy, 
but it seemed reasonable to get that 
way when you were dying and you’d 
been fighting animals that were 
people inside and had a fine brother 
like Black who was too simple to 
either kiss or kill and get it over. 

White Jackson was wondering 
where the failed Honors’ graveyard 
was, out there beyond the fields, 
when the Eld Honors came through 
the crowd and touched him on the 
shoulder. 

“Wake up. Honor — you are 
home with your kill I” the old man 
said in a loud voice. He was all 
knobs and ibones under his brown 
shrunken skin. His cheeks were in 
deep where his teeth bad 'been, and 
his eyes were pouched. If he had 
had wings, he would have been fair 
game. “You all right, son?’’ he 
asked in a low voice. 

W hite could see Black hanging 
off around the edge of the 
crowd with a lot of other Honors. 
“Black talk to you?’’ he said to 
the old man without moving his 
lips. It wasn’t all that unusual to 
see Honors carrying their weapons 
around the Thorn, but there were 



24 



IF 




quite a few of them doing that. 
White would have been happier if 
on this particular day he didn’t see 
so much sun on so many dartheads. 

“Yes.” For the crowd the Eld 
Honor said, “These people are wait- 
ing to praise you.” His hand on 
White’s shoulder had a lot of 
knuckles in it. His voice changed 
again. “What do you think of 
them?” 

White looked frankly and fully 
into the old man’s eyes. “As near 
to what you think as makes no dif- 
ference.” 

“Was Black right in passing you?” 
the Eld Honor asked, which sur- 
prised the daylights out of White. 
But the rheumy old eyes were tight 
on his. Maybe the old man expected 
he could tell a liar that way. Maybe 
he could. 

“As far as you and me go, he 
was right.” 

That might not have been quite 
what the Eld Honor had been ex- 
pecting either, but it was what 
White had for him. It was more 
than White had intended to give 
him. Some of that stuff they told 
kids might really work — always 
give the Eld a straight answer, nev- 
ed do anybody dirt, that kind of 
thing. Parts of it seemed to stick 
better than others. 

They were blowing time. The Eld 
Honor’s mouth was working at the 
corners, and he was looking at 
White the way a farmer looked at 
his wife’s first loaf. But they couldn’t 
keep testing each other out here 
forever. The pressure on the Eld 
was a lot worse than it was on 
White, as far as White could see. 



Seeidg it suddenly as he did, he 
relaxed inside as happily as ever a 
man did when he unstoppercd a 
bubble on a hot day and felt the 
cool water going all the way in to 
the pit of his stomach. He was ready 
to go on this way forever. Hie old 
man had to move, he didn’t; the 
old man would have to think up 
one hell of a story if he had White 
killed now. And White was saying 
things that didn’t really give an 
excuse. They were just aggravating. 

“So you think we’re equals,” the 
Eld said. “You think you’ve lived 
one day longer and all of a sudden 
even your brother and his friends 
are dumb, and only the Eld is fit 
for a man like you to be frank with. 
Must be a happy day when a young 
man picks his peer from the de- 
crepit.” It was hard to tdl when a 
mouth like that was smiling faint- 
ly. “Well, all right. You’ll get your 
badges and tokens, and then we’ll 
talk afterwards.” Hie old man raised 
his voice. “See herel” he cried. “A 
man sits with his kill!” 

That, of course, was the signal 
for a lot of general roaring and 
shouting and people pushing for- 
ward. There were things to do, 
and the Eld Honor pointed out 
people to do them — Black Jackson 
would do the shaving — and White 
Jackson found that becoming a made 
Honor meant you had to shake hands 
with people like Filson and get 
punched around by a bunch of 
farmers who considered that touch- 
ing you was the price of admission 
for standing around and staring at 
a dead Amsir, which was what they 
all went off and did as soon a> 



THE IRON THORN 



25 




they were through assuring them- 
sdves that White Jackson was real. 
**Kee;p it short,** the Eld Honor 
said, as he led White Jackson for- 
ward to where the shaving bowl 
was waiting. 

“Uh-huh,” White Jackson said, 
looking back over his shoulder. 
Black Harrison and Red Filson were 
guarding the Amsir. You still 
couldn’t tell whether Filson was 
grinning; but you could tell about 
Harrison. He was. 

So his hair was cropped short, 
and he was shaved by his brother’s 
steady hand, and they called him 
Honor Secon Jackson to the crowd, 
and the crowd grinned and laughed. 
Secon Jackson stood there with his 
head chilly and thought: Oh you 
people, you dumb happy people. 
You^re Idlling me. 

V 

T he idea was there’d be a feast 
around the Thorn this evening, 
an Amsir^butoheiing, and Secon 
Jackson was now supposed to pick 
the people who’d eat his bird and 
get what parts. He was supposed 
to pick out people who’d been spe- 
cially nice or good to him in his 
younger life. Leaving the feast be- 
tween noon and dark gave people 
he omitted a chance to curry favor. 

He didn’t know whether that last 
part was on purpose or not, but 
he’d seen a lot of Honors turn up 
a lot of bright new friends and rich- 
es on the afternoon of Shaving Day. 
Well, Secon’s father was a long 
time dead, and his mother had gone 
to live with Red Filson, and his 



brother had done his best to raise 
him, when he had time, but then 
there was that business this morn- 
ing. He didn’t have any kindly uncles 
or aunts, not being a farmer bred, 
and he ^dn’t have any friends. He 
might have had some friends this 
morning, but they were all going 
to have to go out into that desert 
pretty soon themselves, and he didn’t 
want them around to listen to a 
pack of lies this evening. So here 
everybody was, looking at him ex- 
pectantly, and the Eld Honor shuf- 
fling off from the edge of the crowd 
to go inside the Thom where the 
Honors lived, and Secon didn’t have 
a thing to say, outloud. 

“Look,” he said, looking around 
at them, thinking he could try say- 
ing Petra Jovan’s name and see how 
they liked having him pick her out 
in front of everybody, “I gotta go 
do something about this,” he said, 
pointing to the wound in his shoul- 
der. “I’ll be seein’ my friends durin’ 
this day.” He pushed his way past 
bis brother and a disappointed sound 
from the people. He heard some 
talk about how he was auctioning 
off the Amsir to the highest bidders, 
and he didn’t give a damn about 
that because he was expecting it. 
His brother pushed up next to him 
and walked beside him. 

“Hey, that ain’t no way to dol” 
Black Jackson said. 

“If I did what I oughta do, you’d 
have holes in you,” Secon Jackson 
said and kept walking. 

H e went into the Thorn through 
the oval doorway as if he’d 
been doing it all his life.

IF 




They taught you tiiat. You mem- 
orized the whole layout^ drawing 
it in the dirt with a sti^ 80 you’d 
know where the Hd Honor was, 
and you’d know where the armory 
was, and the doctor, and where you 
would sleep when you came back 
from the desert after kiHling your 
animal. It was so the farmers would 
think a species of great enlighten- 
ment had fallen on you, and the 
kids tagging along could crane their 
necks and see how sure you were. 
They stopped short at the door, 
of course, 'because they knew that 
anybody that wasn’t an Honor would 
sicken and die right away if he 
dared to step across the high thres- 
hold. 

White Jackson had gotten through 
the door, and peeked up a couple 
or three inside corridors while he 
was a kid. He hadn’t sickened and 
died. 

But he’d been smart enough not to 
do it on a dare, or when anybody 
was watching, and he’d had the 
idea well in mind that if he was 
caught he might wish he could sick- 
en and die. 

Besides, all he’d learned was that 
the inside of the Thorn was just as 
much metal as the outside, except 
it was painted. 

There was a lot of thumping and 
humming inside the Thorn; the 
metal floor shook under his feet. 
There were great big parts to the 
Thorn’s inside layout that he hadn’t 
been taught. He figured that was 
because those were places where 
the machinery was. Something had 
to be making the water that came 
out of the taps, and that ran into 



the fields to make the crops grow. 
He didn’t believe that dead in Ari- 
wol would 'bother to take time out 
from the feasting to do all that by 
magic. If they could, what was there 
a Thom for in the first place? Now 
he had to figure the Thorn ran the 
hats too, and, that being the way 
it was, he was less ready than ever 
to believe in magic from something 
that could be stopped by a hunk 
of rock. 

Maybe they’d let him get a look 
at some of those mechanical in- 
sides, if he was a good boy and 
played along. He wondered if he 
could ever work things around to 
where they’d let him fool with it, 
though, and what was the good of 
machinery you couldn’t fool with? 
So what was the good of playing 
along? And besides, Petra Jovans 
hadn’t tried to talk to him at all 
while he was on his way from the 
shaving bowl to the door to the 
Thorn, and so he was pretty mad 
about everything as he 'found the 
Eld Honor’s door and stepped in- 
side. 

“You don’t knock?” the Eld Hon- 
or said from behind the table where 
he was sitting. 

“You weren’t expecting me?” 
Honor Secon Jackson said. 

The Eld Honor grinned. There 
wasn’t any doubt about it this time; 
he grinned as big a grin as Secon 
Jackson had ever seen on any- 
one, and in some way that scar^ 
the hell out of him. 

“Sit down. Honor,” the Eld said, 
pushing a chair out to him. “I 
think there’s a way we can get 
along pretty well.” 



THE IRON THORN 



27 




r ie chair was exactly the kind of 
thing that everybody had in 
his house, except that this one 
hadn’t been used for so many years 
by so many people and hs wheels 
still rolled. Secon Jackson took it, 
nudged it around to where the desk 
was clearly between him and the 
Eld Honor, and sat down. “All 
right. I wouldn’t mind.’* 

“I wouldn’t, if I were you,” the 
Bid Honor said. “Let’s not mistake 
the situation, Honor Secon Jack- 
son. I’ve been alive a long time, 
and there was a day for me too 
when I went out in the desert and 
got my little surprise. Every Honor 
you see walking around this place 
— every Honor who’s ever told you 
anything about honning and Am- 
sirs — has gone out and had that 
same surprise. You don’t hear any 
of them complaining. And you don’t 
see me having any trouble running 
things. Think about it. Don’t do 
anything that looks good to you. 
Whatever it is I’ve already thought 
of it.” 

Secon Jackson studied him, the 
way he always studied things. The 
grin was a lot less, now, but it was 
still there. Secon Jackson tried to 
think what he’d be thinking if he 
had that grin; that didn’t often do 
much good, but this time it worked. 
It had the feci of truth all over 
it. The old man was thinking what 
a fool Secon Jackson would make 
of himself, and how easy he’d be 
to handle, if he went ahead and did 
what looked perfectly sensible to him. 

All right, Secon Jackson thought, 
then I won’t do it, and the next 
move is yours. 



“So you’re not going to get any- 
thing special out of me just for 
having done what every other live 
Honor in this place has done.” 

I knew that a minute ago, Secon 
Jackson said to himself, and then 
he realized that the old man could 
have that grin and still be maldng 
a fool of himself. He knew Secon 
Jackson was fast but he didn’t be- 
lieve how fast. There’s more Am- 
sir to you than )ust your looks old 
man, Secon Jackson thought, feel- 
ing better, and how would you like 
to go up to Ariwol light now and 
find out about being dhumpy? 

“Don’t plan to kill me now,” the 
Eld said carelessly. “I’ll die soon 
enough, and then you can have it 
all.” 

VI 

I t was like having extra distance 
put between him and his eyes 
and ears. Secon Jackson leaned 
back in his chair and said, “I can.” 
“Yes, you can. But I have to 
tell you how, and you have to 
learn how, and you have to learn 
how to make it stick.” 

“All right,” Secon Jackson, com- 
ing back to himself. “Start in on 
your part of that.” 

The Eld Honor looked amused. 
“Well, I can’t give it all to you in 
one day.” 

“I didn’t expect you could, but 
start in.” 

“All right. Look — things are 
very simple here. We tell the people 
a lot of garbage to make it look 
tricky, but it’s simple. We live 
around the Thorn here, and out be- 



28 



IF 




yond the Thorn is a desert with 
Amsirs on it. We can grow crop, 
and we can get some meat and some 
tool-stuff from honning the Amsirs. 
Now that’s all there is to the 
world. The sun comes up, the sun 
gc^s down. There’s summer, there’s 
winter. There’s just so much land, 
and there are just so many hats 
to give to the Honors. Now, that’s 
all got to be managed. If we let 
the farmers alone, they’d do what- 
ever was easiest, and they’d sit 
around having babies -and planting 
whatever came into their heads, and 
there might be enough food or there 
might not. And even if there was 
enough food — which I don’t think 
the farmers could see to — every- 
body’d live exactly the same. Would 
you like that, Honor?” The old 
eyes were twinkling. 

You don’t need an a*nswer for 
that. Go on.” 

“All right, I don’t need an an- 
swer. Now all you can see is the 
top of the system. You see the 
way we’ve been kidding the farm- 
ers, and you see the things we 
do to make the farmers think we’re 
special. That way, when we see 
something we need to keep this 
place running, we can have it. 
When we see a woman we want 
we can have her. Now let’s talk 
about women. What’s a woman for 
— besides making jokes?” 

“Cooking, cleaning, keeping 
house,” Secon Jackson said. 

The Eld Honor was shaking his 
head, which didn’t surprise Jack- 
son because you don’t ask ques- 
tions if you don’t already know a 
tricky answer. “No,” the Eld Honor 



smd wisely, “a woman is for being 
better than your mother, so you 
can have sons who are better than 
you. Remember that. It’s the same 
way about everything else. When 
you take a farmer’s loaf of bread, 
and you eat that bread, the reason 
for that bread is to make you bet- 
ter — to keep you strong, and 
to make you a better Honor. And 
if one farmer’s woman’s bread is 
better than another’s, then you go 
back to that place for your bread. 
Even if you never take that woman 

— and she might be old and ugly 

— she might have a daughter. And 
you can take that daughter. And 
even if she doesn’t have a daugh- 
ter, you’re still better and stronger, 
and you can take a better woman 
than you could have otherwise. And 
even if you don’t take her, but 
you just use her, and her kid turns 
out to be a farmer, he’s going to 
be a better farmer than he would 
have been, ’cause we already know 
his mother’s man wasn’t good 
enough to stop you.” 

44Q0 we’re always making it bet- 
^ ter, no matter what we do,” 
Secon Jackson said. It occurred 
to him that it was a pretty nice world 
where a Honor could do any damn 
thing that struck his fancy, and 
it always made things better. “Now 
explain about Amsirs that carry 
spears and talk.” 

“We’ll get to that, I promise 
you,” the Eld Honor said. “The 
reason we don’t ever take a chance 
of anybody’s finding out until he 
becomes a Black Honor is the same 
reason we don’t spell any of this 



THE IRON THORN

out where the fanners can hear it.” 
The Eid Honor leaned forward 
earnestly. “Now this is important, 
boy. If you can understand and 
use this, there will be a reason 
for you to be somebody special, 
even among Honors.” 

The Eld gestured negligently. 
“Hell, I know most of the boys 
who carry weapons around here 
are just farmers with a different 
kind of plow. Instead of know- 
ing how to thresh wheat, they 
know how to jump Amsirs, and as 
long as they know that they fig- 
ure it makes them special enough, 
and that’s all the thinking they’ll 
ever have to do. No, boy — ” 
The Eld pointed a dried old skinny 
finger at him — have to be 
like us. You have to have eyes in 
your head, and ears, and some- 
thing in between them. You know 
that mudi as well as I do. What 
I know a lot better than you is 
how. 

“There’s a whole bunch of people 
around here, and every one of them 
thinks he’s someday going to go 
to Ariwol the same as everybody 
else, and live high without work- 
ing. You let him hold onto that, 
because it makes him work while 
he’s here, all right. You let him 
be a farmer, or a Honor, hut you 
let him keep thinking about Ariwol, 
where his kind of people are on top 
for sure. But you make sure he 
knows he’s a farmer, or a Honor, 
because then he knows viio he is, and 
be knows what’s expected of him 
while he’s here. 

“If he knows what’s expected of 
him, then he’ll do what’s expected. 



He won’t start snooping around in 
the middle of the night, or in a 
bunch in the middle of the day, 
and pull the props right out from 
under everything that’s being done 
for him. How many of us do you 
think there are in any generation? 
It’s a damn small number, boy, 
and what all of the farmers and 
most of the Honors aren’t ever 
going to admit to themselves is that 
if it wasn’t for us they’d all be 
dead. They’d be dead from ruin- 
ing the land, or they’d be dead 
from eating wrong, or they’d be 
dead because they’d be messing 
around inside here, and they’d kill 
the Thom.” 

The Eld studied Secon Jackson’s 
face. “Now have you ever heard 
of anybody wanting to get into the 
Thorn that wasn’t entitled to? But 
do you see any guards around? Have 
you ever heard of a farmer sud- 
denly saying, T’m gonna go out 
and hon Amsirs?’ Have you ever 
heard of a farmer saying, T want 
more water.’? And let me ask you: 
if we had guards out front, won’t 
the farmers say T wonder what 
they’re guarding?’ And if it needs 
guards, maybe all 1 have to do to 
understand it is knock somebody 
out of my way?’ Have you ever 
thought what would happen if we 
said to the farmers: ‘You can’t go 
Amsir-honning.’ Wouldn’t they stop 
to wonder ‘Well, hell, diat’s just a 
rule they’re making up.’ No, boy, 
you don’t do that, or you have 
the whole mess of it milling around 
and figuring that all it has to do is 
break a few rules and it can have 
whatever it wants. You show it an

IF 




oj>en doorway, and you say to it, 
That’s for Honors.’ You send peo- 
ple out into the desert, and a lot 
of them don’t come hack. You don’t 
have to tell the farmers that’s just 
for Honors. Not doing it that way, 
you don’t. They can see for them- 
selves. 

“That’s the way you run things, 
boy. And I’ll tell you something 
else — I’ll bet you there are farm- 
ers who have gone out into the 
desert, and I’ll bet you there are 
people who have come through that 
front doorway. But they didn’t tell 
anybody they were going to do it. 
And they either got all the way into 
the desert, and died, or they came 
back from the edge of the desert, 
and they hadn’t seen an Amsir, and 
they didn’t tell anybody about it. I 
don’t think any of them got very 
far. Not because they died, but be- 
cause they knew from everything 
around them since they were kids 
that they should be ashamed. And 
even if they saw an Amsir, or even 
if somebody came in here and saw 
things, he wouldn’t know what they 
meant because nobody ever told him. 
And after a while he’d just go 
away again. And if he didn’t sicken 
and die, he wouldn’t tell anybody 
about that, either, because any- 
body he told just might kill him 
to correct the oversight. Nobody 
loves a loner, boy — ’cause no- 
body knows who he is.” 

Secon Jackson looked back into 
the old man’s tightly squeezed eyes. 
“Unless he’s on top.” 

The old man smiled and nodded in 
agreement. 

“That’s the idea.” 



44 A 11 right,” Jackson said. “Now, 
besides the fact that you 
want some of your young Honors 
to get (killed, how come 1 didn’t get 
told that Amsirs could talk and 
had spears?” 

“Well, you would have started 
making yourself a shield and a 
long spear before you went out 
there,” the Eld Honor said. “And 
if we had told somebody like your 
brother before he went out, he just 
would have had to tell somebody, 
just to show he knew something 
nobody else did. Either way, it 
would have gotten the farmers pret- 
ty well worked up. Listen, boy. What 
did the Amsir say to you?” 

“He said, ‘Yield.’ ” 

The Eld was already nodding — 
it was another one of those ques- 
tions he knew the answer to. “Exact- 
ly. He didn’t want to kill you. You’d 
have to be a lucky damn fool not 
to have known that almost from riie 
start and still be alive, and you’re 
not a damn fool. I’m not so sure 
you’re lucky, either. Boy, there is 
more to the world than anybody 
knows — ” 

“I know that. Figured it out all 
by myself,” said Honor Secon Jack- 
son, who was tired of being called 
‘boy.’ 

“Did you? And did you figure ou| 
what it means? Have you had time 
since it happened to do the same 
thinking that the farmers would do 
if they knew about it and had time 
enough to mull it over? Listen, boy, 
in this world — in this real world 
that’s got to be a lot bigger than 
just the Thom and the desert — 
there’s something that doesn’t want 



THE IRON THORN

to kill Honors, there’s something 
that wants to take them away. He 
wanted you to be his prisoner. And 
he and every other Amsir that has 
let himself be ambushed out there 
was willing to take the dhance of 
dying because he was playing out 
some plan while all the Honor want- 
ed to do was kill him. 

, ‘"Something out there wants Hon- 
ors. Maybe it just wants to eat 
them alive and in comfort someplace 
out of the desert. I don’t know — 
nobody knows. But whatever it is, 
the way it looks is there’s a world 
big enough so that Honors aren’t 
even farmers to it — they’re a 
crop. And how long do you think 
we could run this place around 
here if the farmers knew that was 
what we were?” 

S econ Jackson sat there waiting 
for more, but the Eld was sit- 
ting back in his chair, and looking 
at him as if he’d expected him 
to be knocked over. 

For a minute there, Jackson 
couldn’t believe it. The Eld had 
told him all this, just to make a 
point that Jackson had figured out 
for himself last night in the long 
walk home. All this aggravation, all 
this listening to an old man talk, 
when he could have been doing 
something useful! And here was the 
big pack the old man had un- 
wrapped for him, and there was 
nothing in it — nothing — that 
wasn’t second-hand. 

You old man, he thought, you’ve 
been wasting our time. He said: 
“So you figure I’m smart enough 
so if I learn how to keep people 



in line without shovin’, one of these 
days I’ll get to be the Eld Honor?” 
“You could. You’ve got the best 
chance of anybody.” The old man 
looked at him steadily, with his lie- 
detecting stare. “But you’re going 
to have to earn it. It’s a hard world, 
boy. You can see it’s harder than 
you ever figured. Nothing comes 
easy, not even for one of us.” 

“One of us smart ones,” Honor 
Secon Jackson said. 

“One of us smart ones,” the old 
man agreed. “No sense kidding your- 
self about that. You look at your- 
self any other way, and you’re licked 
before you start.” 

“You seen many smart ones in 
your time?” 

“Some.” 

“Some walking around out there 
now, figuring they’re gonna be the 
Eld? Each one of them, off by him- 
self inside his own head, figuring 
that way?” 

The old man smiled. “Some. Wor- 
ry you?” 

Jackson shook his head. “No.” 
Now the old man grinned again. It 
was almost as if he were getting 
ready to yell, “Yield! Yield!” 

He said: “Got to be that way, 
boy. Got to have it out — got to 
fight. That’s what makes things bet- 
ter; the hammering and the stabbing. 
It’s what gives everything its shape; 
it’s what gouges out the weak 
places. Boy, this place has got to 
be made better. It has got to stand 
up to some day when the Amsirs 
figure a way to get closer to the 
Thom. It has got to be that way 
so we toughen up enough to live 
here if the Thorn ever goes.” The 



32 



IF 




eld man stood up sharply and 
tightly ildcked the metal wall be- 
hind him. The flat of his bony, old 
palm spatted against it. is 

just another damn tool, boy! It’s 
got to wear out some day. Every- 
thing willing, it wiQ be people 
like us who have made the people 
in this place hard enough to do with- 
out iti” The Eld’s eyes were shin- 
ing. He was shaking. “Boy, you’ve 
got to see!** 

“See ahead. See what’s gonna 
happen,” Jackson said. 

“That’s right! That’s what makes 
us!** 

I see. Honor Secon Jackson 
thought. I see what’s ahead. I 
could be like you. “Funny,” he 
said. 

“What’s funny?” 

“I figured, maybe you’d give me 
something special when you saw I 
wasn’t like the others,” Jackson said. 

“I knew you weren’t like the 
others before you ever went out 
there. Don’t you think I would 
have been disappointed mad if you 
hadn’t come back? And I have 
given you something special. I’ve 
given you knowledge** 

“Yeah, well, that was what I 
had in mind,” Jackson said. He 
stood up, reaching across his chest 
to touch his shoulder again. “I 
better go see about this. Bad time 
to heal up crippled, now.” 

vn 

H e went down to the doctor’s 
room. The doctor grunted and 
looked at him out of deep eyes 
and said: “Always here to patch 



you up the best we can, Honor,** 
they swabbed out the igash with 
a clean rag dipped in boii^ water 
and held in a pair of wooden tongs. 

“ ’Predate it. Doc,** Jackson said, 
and left after the doctor had taken 
a couple of stitches. 

He stopped off outside the Thorn, 
where Harrison and Filson were 
still guarding his Amsir, like they 
were supposed to. The way of it 
was, when a Honor brought in his 
bird the Eld picked the hardest men 
of the Thorn to stand guard over 
it. The way people changed their 
ideas of who was the hardest man 
was when a Honor decided he could 
tell somebody like Harrison or Fil- 
son he would guard his own bird. 

Jackson looked at one, then he 
looked at the other. Filson grinned 
at him. Or maybe he didn’t. “Your 
mother’ll be proud of you today.” 
The thing was, you couldn’t tell 
from his face how he meant it. 

“I guess,” Jackson said. “You 
two be at my feast tonigjht, huh?” 
He nodded down at the Amsir. “Can 
have any part of him you want,” 
he said, “ ’Cept I don’t suppose you 
both better want the same part, 
huh?” 

He walked away, and they be- 
ing guards appointed by the Eld 
couldn’t come after him if they 
wanted to. He didn’t stop to look 
back at his Amsir, either. It was 
starting to smell pretty good, which 
some people considered a delicacy, 
but he figured this particular one 
had given him all it could. A lot 
more than it had been ready to, 
and he figured the credit was his, 
not the Amsir’s. 



THE IRON THORN

mere were all kinds of people 
walking around^ fanner women go- 
ing about chores, and kids, 
and the usual sort of traffic. Any- 
body who looked at him, and looked 
like he might want to talk, Jackson 
just said, “You wanna come to my 
feast? Come ahead.” And kept walk- 
ing toward the cement hut that he 
had been living in most of his life 
alone. 

Inside, it was just one room, with 
a pad in the corner. There were 
bone pegs in the walls with pieces 
of kit hanging on them. Some of 
it was just kid stuff; stuff he’d made 
when he was just learning how to 
make his own tools. Play stuff. 
Some of it was pretty useful, but 
he’d gone out with his best gear, 
and that was still either on him 
or in his hand. He sat down cross- 
legged in the corner where he 
usually worked, with the featureless 
light coming in through the parch- 
ment window he’d stretched on a 
wooden frame, and fitted into the 
space where maybe there’d been 
some other kind of lookout when 
the hut was first created, and 
somebody’d scoffed it. Or maybe 
when the world was made who- 
ever made it forgot to make a win- 
dow. 

He reset his dart heads with fresh 
Amsir-hide glue from the little pot 
he kept bubbling in a corner. He 
looked around. He walked over to 
the big blank wall opposite the 
window. The cement was all sooted 
and streaked up where he’d prac- 
ticed pictures and rubbed them out 
and practiced them again, until 
he was pretty well satisfied. There 



were things there that he’d made, 
oh, half three-quarters of a dozen 
years ago. The wall was pretty wdl 
taken up with this kind of thing. 
There were pictures of kids run- 
ning, and yelling, and jumping up 
and down. There were pictures of 
the houses, and the Thom, and a 
few pictures of farmers walking 
along behind their plows with the 
hard edge of the world on beyond 
them. There was something that 
looked a lot like a black blur of 
soot, and was supposed to be the 
Thorn up against the stars at night, 
and didn’t look it. He’d tried leav- 
ing blank spots on the cement to 
make stars, but he couldn’t make 
stars that way. He hadn’t rubbed 
it out because it would have just 
made it even more of a blur. 

T here was a picture of his 
brother. Black would come 
around and look at it every once 
in a while, and shake his head, 
and say, “Is that me?” Well, no, 
but it was a picture of him. It 
was a picture of him all tensed 
up but smooth, with all his weight 
on one leg and the rest of his body 
flying forward with an arm out, 

and a throwing stick way out in 
front of him, and you could see the 
way his fingers were shaped to hold 
on to the end, and the way the 

muscles of that arm had just fin- 
ished snapping out the dart and 

were changing to keep the fingers 
locked on the stick. You could see 
the look on his face, that White 
Jackson had had so much trouble 
getting right, and off — ’way off 
— in the distance you could see 



34 



IF 




something grabbing itself that was 
as close to an Amsir as you could 
draw if the only ones you had ewer 
seen were dead and you had never 
seen one running. 

Secon Jackson looked around the 
room. Ihere wasn’t a thing here 
that he needed to take with him. 
You didn’t expect a Honor to take 
anything out of his old place on 
Shaving Day. Living in the Thom, 
you had the Thom armory and you 
didn’t have to have some kid come 
in and keep your room fire going. 
All you needed was what you could 
carry in your hand — and in your 
head, too, though nobody could tell 
how much that was or what it was. 
People would come in after a Hon- 
or moved out, if he’d been living 
alone, and they took away what 
they needed. Let’s see you take 
that wall away, Jackson thought, 
but he didn’t really give, a damn 
whether they could or not. 

He went over to where he’d made 
a shelf near the tooLmaking fire, 
and looked at the burnt sticks he 
kept there, and the little pots of 
colored mud. He picked up one 
of the sticks, and he walked around 
with it in his hand for a while. It 
felt like something was going to 
come of it, and he looked over 
at the window that was clean with 
light through the translucent scrap- 
ed hide, and he went over and 
looked at that with his fingertips 
and the flc.i; of his palm mbbing 
over it. He leaned enough of his 
weight against it so he was just 
short of breaking through, and then 
he brought up his right hand with 
the stick held as if it were a han- 



dle to something, and watched the 
line of black grow on the parch- 
ment. 

He moved the line by moving his 
body. When the line had gone from 
its beginning to where it was done, 
he put in another one, and when 
he had enough of those he began 
stroking at the parchment with the 
worn-down angled edge of the stick, 
jabbing his body forward from the 
waist and shifting his feet until 
it felt as if he were walking, as 
if he were walking in half-light 
over ground so rough that his feet 
had to be put down carefully. But 
each step was almost exactly the 
same as the last, as if with this 
walk he could go a long way and 
was measuring out his strength 
against how long it would take 
him to get there. He saw the 
Thom from far away, way out over 
the dunes with sunset turning the 
sky, and he saw the rocks nearby 
with their sides toward him black 
and gray, and with just an edge 
bright where he could see the last 
sunlight hitting the parts that faced 
toward the Thorn. 

Down in the sand he did a 
man with his hat off, just landing, 
with his gear coming loose, and 
his shoulder just rolling under. Now 
he saw from beyond the Amsir, who 
had only the tip of one toe in the 
sand, and one wing up, and was 
turning with his face beginning to 
stream out ahead of him, and his 
weight transferring toward the leg 
he was kicking around. The Amsir 
had his neck stretched forward, and 
his mouth open, and he was going 
to do something wild any minute. 



THE IRON THORN 



35 




Now bM. that was left to do was 
the fingers of the one hand you 
could see from behind the .^nsir. 
And the thing was, Honor Jackson 
thought as he looked at it, was 
that the Amsir was going to miss. 

That leg was going to swing 
around just wrong. When it hit the 
sand the other foot would have to 
slide forward — not much, but 
enough so that when the Amsir 
went to spring back toward the man, 
off that leg he was positioning, he 
would be awkward, and maybe one 
step later he might even stumble. 

If he had that hand empty of 
any weight. So Jackson drew in the 
spear. 

F ine, fine, he thought, looking at 
it for his death warrant. Now 
you’ve really done it. He picked 
up one of his darts and used the 
tip of it to cut the drawing out 
of its frame as quickly as he could. 
He slashed fast enough to be reck- 
less. But he noticed while he was 
doing it that he made straight cuts, 
and he didn’t mess up any of the 
drawing. 

It was funny how different the 
room looked when he could see 
out. He put the dart away in his 
armpit, and stood there with the 
parchment rolled up in his hands, 
holding it as if it might twist away 
from him. Ah, he thought, what’s 
the use? One of these days, they’ll 
gut you whether you give them an 
excuse or not. They’ll make up one 
of their own. You’re all the excuse 
they need. 

Not for a minute did he think 
of throwing the drawing on the 



fire. You don’t throw parchment 
away; it comes too hard. Amsirs 
die to give it up. And ‘besides, the 
only drawings you rub out are the 
ones that aren’t real. 

He wished he had somebody here 
to kill. But he couldn’t kill them 
all and live here by himself. 

He went outside, carrying his two 
darts and his stick, his cap riding 
loose on the back of his head, and 
with the half-full bubble of water 
jogging behind his back. Carrying 
the drawing made it awkward, be- 
cause he was used to having one 
hand free. His shoulder hurt like 
blazes, and he could have used some 
sleep, and some food. The skin 
around ‘his neck, and on his ears, 
was itching with sunburn. He felt 
bad. 

He scowled at Petra Jovans as she 
came stepping up to him from where 
she’d been waiting. All of a sud- 
den he figured maybe he better 
find out for sure just how much 
of her was fanner. “You want to 
come to my feast, too?” he said 
with a lot of kill in ‘his voice. 

She looked up at ‘him with her 
head at an angle. “No, I don’t want 
to be like everybody else.” 

Her voice was simple, ‘her eyes 
were clear. Her mouth wasn’t twist- 
ing. She just said it, the way she 
would have said water runs out of a 
tap, or the sun shines on the Thorn. 
Looking at her, he knew something 
all complete, all one piece, all of 
a sudden. What she was here to 
tell him was that she wanted to be 
his woman. It was the only thing 
she could be here for, and it was 
her way — the way he understood 



36 



IF 





THE IRON THORN 



37 




way. It sure wasn’t the way 
things were supposed to go be- 
tween t>oy and girl. 

Now she was standing there, 
waiting. You could tell by looking 
at her, she figured the words she’d 
just said were just as good as the 
words she’d been going to say. 
Now he was supposed to pick up 
on that. 

She figured he could pick up on 
that. He had the right kind of 
thinking to be a fit man for Petra 
Jovans. 

Yield, yield, he thought to him- 
self, and the feeling came over 
him strong and hot that one of us 
at one time, on one day, for one 
killing, was enough. 

“All right, then have this,” he 
said, jabbing the roUed-up drawing 
at her. “You want to be different. 
That’s different.” 

She unrolled it and looked at it, 
and then looked up at him. “You 
didn’t make this up, did you? This 
is how it is.” 

“Yeah. And now you're stuck 
with it.” He had no idea why he 
went on to say: “By the way, my 
name’s Jim.” He turned away and 
walked off, leaving her there. 

Oh, you people. Honor Secon 
Black Jackson thought. You people. 
You people! 

vm 

I t wasn’t too crowded now. The 
fanners had gone off to the fields, 
and the women were doing their 
household stuff. The smell of fresh 
bread hung around the Thom like 
gjue. The Honors were either off 



sleeping or practicing things. There 
were kids playing around, and some 
of them tried to hang around him. 
But you can always get rid of a kid 
by looking at him as if he was 
nothing, and Jackson did that as 
he walked along. 

Petra wouldn’t have followed him; 
Petra wouldn’t follow anybody. 
She’d wait. Or maybe she’d follow 
when no one was looking, but she’d 
make it look like it was at her own 
good time. 

Jackson walked over to the 
Thorn to look at his Amsir. He 
studied the places where it kept 
its wind and water. Lx)oking at it 
that way, he could see how much 
it looked like a thin, dried-out man 
with big blisters under his skin. In 
his mind, Secon Jackson gave the 
Eld Honor another snort. 

Red Filson grinned at h^, rub- 
bing his chin and jaw, which were 
as tough-looking as the rest of him. 
Secon Jackson knew his own face 
was flaming pink where the beard 
had been, and he didn’t like to have 
Red Filson tell him he was funny- 
looking. But he wasn’t that interest- 
ed in Filson just now, and it prob- 
ably showed, because Filson said: 
“Just about everybody around the 
Thorn’s gonna be at you feast to- 
night, huh? Spreadin’ things a lit- 
tle thin.” 

“Well, tell you — you’re that 
worried. I’ll watch the bird, and 
you go out and get another one 
to throw in the pot.” 

Harrison chuckled softly. Filson 
never much changed expression. 
“Some people figure they could 
maybe pay off everything the same 



38 



IF 




day I guess.” he said speculatively. 

Jackson found himself having to 
look deep into Filson’s eyes. “Now 
and then, 1 guess, one day’s all 
the time a man might need,” he 
said, thinking that one of the trou- 
bles with killing a man out in plain 
sight was you had to hang around 
for the Eld’s judgment on you, 
and there was a lot of fasting, and 
sitting around cogitating and trial- 
ling to be got through- A man 
could sicken and die, waiting for 
the trialling to get over. He turned 
around and walked away, head- 
ing off between the nearest houses. 
And he just kept walking. 

IX 

I t was hot and gritty, lying buried 
in the sand. Secon Jackson felt 
miserable. He lay trying to breathe 
as little as possible, just his nose out 
in sight, finding out about the world 
around him by ear. It had to <be 
about a third of a dozen hotirs since 
he’d walked away from the Thorn. 
And lately he’d begun to hear stir- 
rings in the ground — the chuck- 
a-chuck-a-chucka of quick-running 
feet, sometimes near and sometimes 
far. 

The sounds always moved from 
the direction of the Thorn, so he 
knew they weren’t Amsirs. As a mat- 
ter of fact, he was just far enough 
away from the Thom to give trouble 
to anyone trying to find him, and 
not far enough out yet to really 
be in Amsir country. 

He figured even with thirty or 
forty Honors to send out. The Eld 
would have a hell of a time find- 



ing him around the perimeter of 
as much radius as he put between 
himself and the little concrete 
houses around the big metal spike. 

He wasn’t too worried about be- 
ing found, both because there 
weren’t enough people to really 
search and because whoever found 
him, it figured it would take more 
than one or two of them. Mostly, he 
lay there dreaming. 

There’s a lot of stuff out in the 
desert — spears, dead Honors and 
very likely some dead Amsirs, too, 
with holes from spear mounded Hon- 
ors in them but no way for any- 
body to account for them in the 
village if the Honors couldn’t come 
back. He dreamt about all those 
dead men under the sand with him. 
From the way the Eld had talked, 
things had been going the way they 
went now for a long time back. In 
that time a lot of metal spears and 
a lot of dead Honors must have 
gotten hidden out around here. If 
you could farm this well fertilized 
country, die size of the grain stalks 
you could ralsel 

But you can’t raise grain where 
you can’t breathe. And if you’re 
a farmer you only know one way 
to breathe. 

Well, Secon Jackson thought, 
come to that if you’re a Honor you 
only know one way to breathe. If 
you were an Amsir you probably 
didn’t know any more than that. 
Oh, a man could find out, three 
different ways to get air and water, 
but that wasn’t what he meant by 
that dream. 

He didn’t dare move much. He’d 
done a lot to cover his tracks and 



THE IRON THORN 



39 




there was just enough constant rip- 
pling in the sand so that even wh^ 
he wasn’t hearing chuck~a-chucka 
sounds there was a sort of hissing 
in his ears. A dozen dozen dozen 
dozen grains of sand he thought, dry 
as life, rubbing. He saw himself 
floating on the sand and ih& sand go- 
ing on down deeper and deeper. He 
twitched a little finger and by the 
thickness of one grain of sand his 
finger hid itself farther. By the 
thickness of one grain of sand push- 
ing out of the way underneath, fill- 
ing in above, he was that much 
closer to sinking down to where 
the deepness stopped. I could float, 
he had thought. 1 could float here 
a long time, but I’d sink little by 
little. 

What is this stuff I’m in? he 
thought. Dust. Nothing. Out at the 
edge of the field, beyond the weed 
borders of the village it smoked 
up into the air like hope and twisted 
in around back on itself, drifting up 
so thin, so fine, that you could w^k 
through it almost without knowing 
it was there, and could only see it 
edge-on when you were passing 
throu^ the middle of it. Then it 
had substance; a thin, dirty yellow 
line, curving up in an arc that 
probably reached just below the 
gridwork at the top of the Thom, 
but lost itself and couldn’t be seen 
that high. Thin enough to drink. 

Chuck-a-chuck-a-chucka, Someone 
was coming close, but off at a lit- 
tle bit of an angle, Secon Jackson 
judged from the way the sounds 
didn’t get louder quite as fast as 
they beat on the sand. Somebody 
running; some Honor saying to him- 



self he would find Secon Jackson 
any minute now. 

H e wondered what the Eld was 
saying to the farmers to ex- 
plain what had happened to Secon 
Jackson. He wondered if the Eld 
was bothering to say anything — 
they all knew Secon Jackson was 
crazy, or if they hadn’t known it, 
it would occur to them now. He 
wondered what the Eld thought. It 
must be a good long time since a 
Honor ran out on his feast, a good 
long time since the Eld had seen 
any need to wonder what a man 
might be doing. Secon Jackson 
grinned carefully with the sand 
murmuring on his lips, and went on 
dreaming. 

He dreamed through the rest of 
the short afternoon and into the 
twilight. When it was full dark and 
cold, and it had been three dozen 
parts of a day since 'he’d slept, he 
slipped up out of the sand. Boy, 
he thought looking up at the night, 
I’d sure better know what I’m 
doing. 

He began to walk toward the 
edge of the world. He felt a little 
draggy. 

From time to time he put his 
face down to the ground, and from 
time to time he coidd hear the 
sound of r unnin g Honors chuck-a- 
chucking distantly. Merely because 
they couldn’t imagine what else to 
do, they were quartering back and 
forth across the line his Amsir 
had led him on yesterday. That 
happened to be exactly right, be- 
cause that was where 'he was head- 
ed, thinking that maybe Amsirs al-

ways worked back to that line in 
the end, when they’d gotten Honors 
far enough away from the Thom. 
But he wasn’t being any dumb 
Honor himself. Now he was headed 
off at another angle, covering more 
ground than you’d cover if you 
only had a used bubble of water and 
were planning to ever make it back 
to the Thom. 

He’d done that on purpose. He 
could imagine them comparing notes 
and figuring out he’d never gone 
to one of the Thorn taps. He could 
imagine them figuring out that they 
couldn’t figure out what the hell 
he’d been thinking of, just taking 
off like that. He had imagined them 
not believing it when he walked 
by first one line of huts, and then 
the next one farther out and then 
the next one and then out into 
the nearest field and then the one 
beyond that, and so on. They just 
couldn’t believe it; when he was lost 
from sight of the people around the 
Thorn, covered by the houses be- 
tween him and them, he could ima- 
gine them not believing he hadn’t 
stopped just out of sight. 

But he’d done all that. He’d just 
sloped off and gone out without 
enough supplies, and he’d gone off 
without eating, and now he was 
headed in the wrong direction, and 
those are the only reasons he’d got- 
ten away. 

“Well, no Secon Jackson thought. 
He was going to get away because 
he could imagine them, but they 
couldn’t imagine him. They could 
never imagine what he wanted. 

Red Filson’s dart took him in the 
elbow. 



I t spun him around and knocked 
him down, and it took his left 
arm out of the fight. He sprang 
for his life, throwing himself to 
one side, not even knowing yet who 
he was fighting, knowing only be- 
cause he rolled over its head that 
it was a dart in his elbow and 
not a spear. 

Now the shock was going through 
him. It was so bad even his left leg 
felt wooden for a while. He’d never 
been clobbered so hard in his life. 
Then he saw the shape of the man- 
shadow jumping toward him, knew 
it was Filson and was happy. 

‘Tough luck. Honor,” Filson said, 
getting ready to stab. 

He was very fast — as fast as 
Secon Jackson had ever dreamed 
him — and Jackson could only 
hope to be as fast as he had ever 
dreamed himself. He got out of the 
way of the first lunge. But he 
couldn’t make his feet grip light; 
and when he tried to turn, his dead 
left arm knocked against his knee. 
He went down again, just as if Fil- 
son had struck him. It was like 
fighting in a dream. 

Filson was good. He was like 
something you’d hear about from 
an old woman. Jackson flopped 
forward off his knees, knowing 
exactly how this would put him 
inside Filson’s kick and knowing 
exactly what he would try to do 
to Filson after that. But Filson 
kicked him anyhow. And one more 
time Jackson was down. 

He had his stick, but he didn’t 
have either of his darts. The best 
he could do was grab his left wrist 
and scratch at Filson’s side going 



THE IRON THORN

by, using the head of the dart 
sticking out through his elbow. 
He might even have cut the other 
man some — he thought he felt the 
point dragging momentarily — but 
that was a hell of a defense to put 
up, wasn’t it? He struck out at 
Filson with the stick, missing; 
dropped it, grabbed sand and threw 
it at the other man’s face, and 
didn’t seem to have any effect on 
him. “Boy, you messed it,” Filson 
said. “I would have figured you for 
my best enforcer when I became 
Eld. Your mother would have liked 
that a lot. Now look what you’re 
doing to your family.” 

Will they at least give me any 
peace in Ariwol? Secon Jackson 
thought bitterly as he twisted out of 
Filson’s way again. He tried to think 
of things to do with one arm. 

He could pull off Red’s cap, he 
supposed. But his own was loose 
and jouncing around his skull; he 
was in no shape for any game that 
two could play. He tried for a grip 
on Filson’s dart-arm, but it was like 
trying to hold a piece of the Thom 
come to life. The best he could 
do was drag his nails across Fil- 
son’s biceps as the hold broke. He 
figured it would only take him two 
or three days to scratch the man to 
death. 

H e spun away and tried to drag 
the dart out of his elbow so 
that he would have a weapon too, 
but all that did for him was near- 
ly make him faint. 

They were scuffling and flutter- 
ing like two kids under a blanket 
out here; whirling and groping for 



each other in the dark raising dust, 
making slapping sounds as they tried 
for each other and made each other 
miss. But it couldn’t be much long- 
er before Filson got that other dart 
in. Jackson knew it, and Filson knew 
it. Filson was doing it like a prac- 
tice. He even found time to talk. 
“Where did you think you were go- 
ing?” he panted scornfully. “It’s 
all right being crazy, but I never 
figured you for dumb.” 

Maybe he thought that woidd be 
a finish line. His arm hooked down 
and came up again, and his fore- 
arm snapped over as he punched 
his dart toward Jackson’s face. Jack- 
son dropped under it, but he was 
off his feet again. He made a try 
at knocking Filson’s knees together, 
and then dropped sideward, barely 
getting out of the way of the other 
man’s return stroke. The side of 
Jackson’s face in the sand. 

That made all the difference. He 
could hear the new sounds coming 
up fast . chicka-sipy chicka-sip, 
chicka-sip. 

In his mind — but very quickly 
— Secon Jackson laughed like cra- 
zy. It was working out after all. 
Turned out he’d damned near died 
before he could know for sure. 
Maybe he still would, if he couldn’t 
stall Red off. 

He had to interrupt himself to 
flounder out of the way of the 
next msh. 

But it was nice to know he’d 
been figuring it all correct, from 
the minute that he had been sit- 
ting there in the Eld’s room in 
the Thorn and had been beginning 
to think on it, because where else 



42 



IF 




was there any hope at all for 
him? 

He pushed the laugh out into the 
cold air. “Huhl” He kicked toward 
Red’s ankle and made him hop hack. 
“I know where I’m goin’.” Well, no, 
he didn’t but he knew whom he was 
going with. Chicka-sip, chicka-sip, 
whop! That was the sound of the 
running Amsir coming down solid 
on both fe^ nearby. Up against the 
stars and the horizon there was a 
fast glimpse, for Jackson to get, of a 
javelined wing upfurling. 

“I yield! yield!” Jackson shouted 
to the Amsir making a grab for 
Red, who was distracted. His two 
stiff fingers found Filson’s nostrils. 
His hand came back, and then he 
kicked with all his heart as the 
choking man clapped both hands to 
his tom, shocked face. Filson bent 
double. Jackson plucked Filson’s 
second dart from between the man’s 
limp fingers, and then made one 
move more, with the dart held for 
cutting windows. He drc^)ped the 
dart and stood holding to right 
thumb and forefinger tight around 
his left arm above the elbow. The 
Amsir stood looking at him, its 
spear ready, only the lace stirring 
on its body. 

“I do yield,” Jackson said, look- 
ing down at Filson all huddled up. 
He kicked a little sand toward the 
dead man. “My name is Honor Red 
Jackson.” 

X 

CCX^ou will come with me, damp 
A thing?” the Amsir said in 
its high, puzzled voice. You could 



tell it felt proud — you could tell 
he felt proud — but you could tell 
he couldn’t understa^ what had 
happened. Well, that was all right, 
too, Jackson thought. 

“I better had,” Jackson said. “Or 
there’s been a lot done for noth- 
ing. My mother’s a widow twice 
over for nothing.” 

“You’re wounded, wet one. You’re 
spilling moisture. Come with me 
quickly.” 

“Right behind you.” 

“Before me.” 

They ran over the night desert, 
chuck-a-chuck-a-chucka, chicka-sip^ 
chicka-sip. The Amsir gave Jackson 
his directions with light little touch- 
es of the spearpoint, until finally 
they reached the place the Amsir 
wanted, and the leathery bird said: 
“Stop. Dig here.” 

Crouching down, Jackson did his 
one--handed best. A sixth of a dozen 
feet down, he felt something hard 
and swollen under his fingertips. He 
pulled it out. It was a ladder of 
some kind, twice as thick through 
as a man’s head. It felt as if it 
were made of glue-varnished leath- 
er; he could feel the edges of 
seams, and then a folded-in stopper. 

“That is breathing-stuff,” the Am- 
sir said. “You will need it soon; the 
iron cap is almost useless to you 
now. Dig deeper. There is a mois- 
ture-bottle, and there are wrappings 
for warmth. There are patches for 
your hide.” 

Jackson dug them out. The water 
bottle was a lot like the Amsir- 
bubble at his back in size, but it 
felt like the oxygen bladder. The 
robes were some kind of leather.

IF 




tanned soft. They’d used leather for 
the body-patches, too. 

They thought of everything when 
they cached one of these bringing- 
in-the-prisoner kits. They knew they 
weren’t likely to get many without 
holes in them. 

He still couldn’t get the daft out, 
so he tied off his arm, using his 
good hand and his teeth to make 
the knot. The Amsir still couldn’t 
come anywhere nearer him than the 
length of the spear. 

There were sling-straps for the 
oxygen-bladder and water bottle. He 
unhooked his own bubble, drained 
it dry, and tossed it away in the 
dark before he replaced it with the 
Amsir bottle. Then he said: “Set,” 
and they began moving again toward 
where, once upon a time, his in- 
curving horizon had been. 

A s they traveled, he asked one 
questi6n, once: “You bring 

in any other prisoners ever?” 
“You’re my first.” 

We sure have lost a lot of maidens 
today. Honor Red Jackson thought. 
He was getting very cold. After a 
while he had to pull out the length 
of tied-off gut glued into the oxygen 
bubble, stick the end of it in his 
mouth, and use that for air, pinching 
the gut between two fingers to keep 
himself from swelling into broken- 
lunged sickness and death. 

When the sun came up, they saw 
it sooner than almost anybody Jack- 
son knew, for they were at the top 
of his world’s rim. 

Jackson was bone-pulling cold. He 
had to peek out between his eye- 
lids. He hurt in his nose and his 



ears, and behind his ears. He saw 
his robes were made of stitched- 
together human skins, and for a min- 
ute he was scared and furious, but 
then he remembered the thrown- 
away Amsir bubble, and he told 
himself it didn’t mean much. Or 
maybe it did, but not now. 

“Hurry along! You will die here, 
but it is not much farther to com- 
fort ... if one is not altogether a 
damp thing.” 

Jackson squinted ahead. He saw 
bdow him another great dish-shaped 
world. But this one was blue-green 
from rim to rim; fences, light as 
stretched strings marking out plots, 
divided the land. High houses on 
stUt legs shone pink and ochre and 
glistening blue; bright yellow and 
sharp green flashing in the sunlight. 
Lacy lines, fragile as the fencing, 
trac^ from house to house, swaying 
down in free arcs, webbing the 
whole town together. And at the 
center of this world, far away, he 
could see a Thorn. A tall, massive 
shining Thorn, not the blunt, tilted, 
rust-streaked thing he had been 
born under. A fairy trap of grid- 
work twined in the air around its 
peak. And everywhere, ever 3 Twhere, 
in the air, curving, curvetting, dis- 
porting, the Amsirs trafficked. 

Air. Thick, lustrousily clear, it 
reached out to envelope him as the 
Amsir pushed him forward. 

Ariwol! Red Jackson thought 
grinning and then laughing. Ariwol, 
by everything pious! He arched his 
back and stared up into the sky 
again. Shouting and singing and 
laughing he thought. But I don’t

T he VTOL turned its propellers 
skyward and settled softly on 
its tail in the middle of the fifty- 
foot square of reinforced concrete 
that was the landing field of Friday 
Island. 

Major William Bruce crawled out 
of the rear cockpit and lowered his 



lean body to the concrete. He look- 
ed upward at die vertical sheer of 
the aircraft’s fuselage. He didn’t like 
VTOL’s, but except for a helicopter 
(whose range was too short) and a 
blimp (whose speed was too low) 
nothing else could land on this tiny 
spire of rock jutting out of the South 
Atlantic. 

Bruce waved to the pilot, and the 



46 




pilot nodded. Servos whined, and 
clamshell doors opened in the fuse- 
lage near the tail to reveal stacks of 
cardboard cartons. Bruce carried 
them to the side of the field. He 
lifted a steel plate set flush with 
the ground, touched a button and 
began, one by one to place the boxes 
on a moving conveyor belt. When he 
had finished, he pulled a heavy hose 
out of the recess and dragged it 
over to the plane, where he coupled 
it into a quick-connect near the tail 
and attached a ground wire. Fuel 
began to gush from the plane into 
the hose, as he waved again to the 
pilot and walked the hundred feet 
from the plane to the low concrete 
building capped with a radar mast 
and antennae which rose above the 
topmost level of the island. He 
pressed his right thumb against a 
small glass plate set in the steel door 
at the side of the building and wait- 
ed. Ten seconds passed until the door 
slid sideways with ponderous slow- 
ness and framed a slim redhead in 
Airforce blue with major’s oak- 
leaves on his shoulders. 

“Hi Sucker,” the redhead said, 
“back for another tour?” 

Bruce shook his head, “No, Al, 
I’m at the Beach Club.” 

“Well — I’m glad to see you. It 
gets lonely out here. I’ll think of 
you the next two weeks while you’re 
sweating it out. They’ve got a beauty 
for you; six birds from Kennedy and 
one major tracking mission on a 
polar orbital. You ought to be real 
busy.” 

“Nice,” Bruce said without en- 
thusiasm. Al Vaughan had all the 
luck. He never got the rough ones. 



Six birds were enough for anyone 
without adding an orbital to the 
mess. Bruce sighed inaudibly. It 
would be nice to have a couple of 
the birds about, but that might be 
hard on Scotty Jacobs, and Bruce 
didn’t want that, Scotty — the third 
man on the team — already had 
enough trouble with a pregnant wife. 
If Alice Jacobs knew what her hus- 
band did those two weeks of every 
six when he was away on “business,” 
she’d stop complaining and have a 
miscarriage instead. 

B ruce looked at his dapper coun- 
terpart, “there’s about five hun- 
dred pounds of supplies on the con- 
veyor. You might help me unload.” 
Vaughan shook his head. “Not on 
your life,” he said, “that’s your job. 
I have a blonde in Miami that has 
first priority.” 

“You’re a lazy bum,” Bruce said 
without heat. 

“You’ll thank me later,” Vaughan 
said, “it’ll give you something to do. 
Time hangs heavy here.” 

“I’ve never noticed, but maybe 
you’re right. Anyway have a good 
time stateside — and don’t forget 
to disconnect our fuel hose before 
you take off.” 

“I want to get home alive,” 
Vaughan said, “so don’t worry. I’ll 
check everything. Good-by pal — 
the place is yours.” 

Bruce pushed past Vaughan into 
the building, and as Vaughan went 
outside, the steel portal closed and 
would remain that way until Scotty 
Jacobs took over in two weeks. 

He stripped, placed his clothing 
in the sanitizer, stepped into the de- 



A HAIR PERHAPS 



47 




contamination chamber and looked 
through its glass walls into the con- 
trol room beyond. 

As usual, it was antiseptically 
clean. 

The Big Board was working, and 
as Bruce showered, he watched the 
electfbnic brain of the station check 
out the VTOL as it lifted from the 
pad and sped northwestward to the 
carrier waiting below the horizon. 

A bank of red lights bloomed on 
the board as a beam of electrons 
stabbed the departing plane and was* 
reflected into the tracking dish. The 
board chittered, beeped and squeak- 
ed as computers analyzed the flight 
and fed data to the missile program- 
mers. The Big Board hurl^ a pre- 
emptory challenge at the plane, and 
the VTOL answered with the prop- 
er IFF signal. The lights blinked off, 
the noises died and the Big Board 
returned to stand-by. You don’t shoot 
friends who have the right answers. 

Watching the electronic interplay 
between plane and station, Bruce 
had , an old familiar thought that if 
it weren’t for emergencies, this sta- 
tion could dispense entirely with 
men. He dried himself and slipped 
into the blue, lint-free coveralls and 
slippers that were standard dress for 
anyone in the station. The place was 
spotlessly clean. It had to be. The 
delicate instruments and circuitry, 
although sealed, could still be ad- 
versely affected by particulate mat- 
ter, and so extreme efforts were 
made to keep all foreign matter out. 

Bruce went from decon through 
the interlook to his glassed-in living 
quarters, sealed off in one corner of 
the station. He opened a hatch in 




the wall and began to unload boxes 
from the conveyor bck, open them, 
vacuum their contents and place 
them neady in the appfopraate sec- 
tion of the storage lockers that lined 
one wall. Since there was everything 
from food to spare parts, the uncrat- 
ing and sorting took time. 

He was in the middle of a box of 
electronic parts when a buzzer 
soimded. Bruce looked at his watch. 
Time for the 1600-hour service 
check. He put the carton aside, 
went through the interlock into the 
Board Room and began to check 
the instruments that filled it, look- 
ing with experienced eyes for any 
evidence of malfunction. 

There was none, except for the 
vertical radar, and that had been 
acting peculiarly ever since the sta- 
tion had been re-equipped last year. 
When the radar first began show- 
ing that peculiar shimmering pat- 
tern on its disk a few hours after it 
had been installed*, it had triggered 
a major flap at Kennedy. Literally 
dozens of top brains had come to 
Friday Island. Checks were made, 
instruments were tom down and re- 
built. New circuits were installed. 
Three space missions were fired in- 
to the outer regions above Friday 
Island. The radar picked them up 
perfectly, but it still transmitted that 
peculiar cloudy shimmer. It was 
something that neither Bruce nor 
any of the others could explain, and 
it was bothersome. The official de- 
cision that the phenomenon resulted 
from an interaction with the mineral 
core of the island was unsatisfying, 
but acceptable for lack of a better 
theory. It just went to prove that all 



the quirks of radar had not yet been 
solved He shm^ed and mn 
through the test procedures. Except 
for the shimmer, the set checked out 
A-OK. 

B ruce went from instrument to 
instrument as precisely compe- 
tent as the machines he served. The 
Job was lonely work. For a fortnight^ 
he ran the station checking the in- 
struments and collecting visual data 
on birds fired from Cape Kennedy 
six thousand miles to the northwest. 
For another fortnight at. Kennedy, he 
reviewed reports and data with the 
brains and performance evaluation 
teams. Then for a third two weeks, 
he was free to do as he pleased as 
long as he remained within range of 
the CIA men assigned to guard him. 

He was an important man. The 
Job made him a national resource 
that had to be guarded carefully and 
protected — not from harm — but 
from enemies who could use his 
specialized knowledge. The feeling 
of importance had once been good, 
but lately it had become annoying. 
He was never alone; not even on 
the island. He was watdhed, moni- 
tored and checked twenty-four hours 
a day. In his body were implanted 
ho min g devices by which he could 
be located even if he were uncon- 
scious. There was a hollow tooth in 
his jaw which — if bitten a certain 
way — would pmson him quickly 
and beyond hope of antidote. Except 
at the station, he always went arm- 
ed. He was an excellent shot and 
knew most of the dirty tricks ©f 
hand-to-hand combat His instruc- 
tors were proud of him.

For a young and patriotic man 
^the position and its prerequisites of- 
fered enough satisfaction to ensure 
dedicated performance, but Bruce 
had been on The Job for five years 
and was older and more cynical than 
he had been at twenty-five. The di- 
versions that were his for the ask- 
ing during his free two weeks were 
no longer diverting. He didn’t care to 
drink and had a built-in block against 
getting drunk, which meant that his 
virtually unlimited and unaudited ex- 
pense account was useful only to 
provide a means of living so dan- 
gerously that the attrition rate among 
his CIA shadowers was inordinately 
high. In some quarters it was felt that 
if he broke his damn neck, it would 
be a good thing. Knowing this gave 
him a great deal of amusement, for 
Bruce was not by nature a kindly 
man, and he derived a good deal 
of pleasure out of watching others 
squirm. 

Yet his small meannesses were 
understood and excused by his su- 
periors. After all, for two weeks out 
of every six he was in the center of 
a missile impact area, and for the 
remaining four, he was either being 
brain^icked at the Cape or a poten- 
tial target for ultimate interrogation 
by Ivan and his friends. 

Nevertheless, Bruce still thought 
he was living an easy life. He liked 
the clean results of precision ma- 
chinery and sophisticated devices. 
And he enjoyed the knowledge of 
his real importance that ultimately 
came to those on The Job. For men 
were needed on Friday Island. They 
can do things which machines can- 
not. They can judge, discriminate. 



bypass routine, be intuitive, and 
originate concepts. Machines cannot; 
they can only react. Iherefore he 
and his oo-workers were needed. 
They gave the human touch that 
made the station a vital part of the 
nation’s defense program. But to put 
more than one man on the Island 
at a time was simply borrowing trou- 
ble. 

More than one were not needed 
— not even for security. Friday 
Island was fantastically secure. The 
best minds in the nation had helped 
construct the Island’s defenses. The 
place was as close to impregnability 
as human skill and technology could 
make it, and it was constantly be- 
ing strengthened as new devices be- 
came available. 

I ts electronic senses reached out 
for several hundred miles in all 
directions from sea level to straight 
up, and as one came nearer the 
island, the precision and delicacy 
of the sensors increased. For de- 
fensive armaments the island had a 
weapons complex that ranged from 
conventional mines to highly sophis- 
ticated, self-arming, antipersonnel 
missiles that could tell friend from 
stranger and behave accordingly. 
And backing this were elements of 
the Fourth Fleet. It would take a 
major effort to seize the station, and 
no country on Earth would be fool 
enough to try it. 

But just in case any enemy was 
lucky enough to take the station, the 
walls and instruments were rigged 
with explosives which could be 
detonated as a last resort. In a way, 
living on Friday Island was an- 



50 



IF 




^alogaus to living on a powder keg; 
but if one could ignore this un- 
pleasant fact, it was not a bad life. 
The work was not too demanding, 
and the morale office had outdone 
itself to provide outlets for the in- 
evitable leisure time. 

About the only thing that dis- 
turbed Bruce was the ghostly pat- 
terns on the vertical radar. They 
drew him back time and again. They 
were annoying — more so because 
they were inexplicable. Precision in- 
struments, in Bruce’s book, should 
behave predictably and not like pri- 
ma donnas. 

“It’s just possible that Ivan has a 
satellite out there looking down my 
neck,” he muttered to himself as 
he often did while working on The 
Job. “He’d have to be about 18,000 
miles out, and at that range this 
radar couldn’t unravel anything.” He 
shrugged. “But, what good would 
an observer be out there? This whole 
island wouldn’t be any bigger than 
a pimple on a peach pit, and equip- 
ment to see accurately that far hasn’t 
been built and won’t be for another 
twenty years. Anyway, it’s a crazy 
thought. We’ve sent probes and 
found nothing, but I sure wish I 
could get over the idea that there’s 
something out there watching us.” 
He shrugged and grinned self-con- 
sciously, glad that there was no one 
around to hear him. 

The first few days on The Job 
were always tough, and the nights 
were worse. The abrupt time change, 
the changes from winter to summer, 
from companionship to loneliness 
(incidentally, how about that blonde 
in Miami Beach? Was she really 




lonely or was she a CIA plant? May- 
be she was the same one A I Vaughan 
was chasing. Now thafd be one for 
the books. Still, it might not be so 
farfetched as it seemed. The CIA 
had some pretty slick tricks and 
some pretty slick blondes in its bag.), 
from excitement to routine (that 
weekend in Vegas was a real blast, 
and that drag race out on the flats 
had been a gasser.), from heedless 
ness to duty (there is nothing like 
a four a.m. champagne party to get 
the blood circulating — and that 
lonely blonde — ah mel), all con- 
spired to keep Bruce from sleeping. 
There were too many memories to 
lay upon a quiet pillow. 

As a result he was awake when 
the Big Board bloomed red in the 
IFF sector. There were the usual 
chirpings and chitterings as the an-

cillairy equipment came to life. Bruce 
looked interested. Nothing had come 
this close this late at nigiht Im: as 
long las he could remember. TsebaMy 
a UFO — some poor devil li^pstaitrs 
in a plane that was miles off course. 
If he passed the island within the 
25-mile zone» the defense missiles 
would shoot him down. He ought to 
be warned. 

Bruce reached for the microphone 
and opened the set to commercial 
channel. “Warning!” he said. ‘This 
is Friday Island Station, Prohibited 
area.” He looked at the radar screens 
to get the UFO’s direction. The hori- 
zontal screens were dead, but in the 
center of the vertical and enlarging 
visibly as he watched was a white 
circular patch centered like the bull’s- 
eye of a target. 

And as he watched, the Big Board 
went dead. That thing upstairs had 
sent the proper IFF signal, but signal 
notwithstanding it was no friend. 

His hands leaped toward the con- 
trols. His fingers hit the counter- 
mand key, the emergency control 
key and the action key in one smooth 
flow of motion. A idaxon sounded, 
and the lids of the silos slid back to 
reveal the needle noses of four Sprint 
missiles. “Range two hundred thou- 
sand,” the mechanical voice an- 
noimced. “Firing time 10 seconds.” 
Bruce pressed the firing key and the 
emergency alarm to alea^ Cape Ken- 
nedy, and as he did the lights went 
out, and every mechanism within 
the station stepped. 

T he silence was a shocking thing. 

i He had never realized how 
much noise there was on The Job 



until it was cut o£L The 8id>liminal 
beepings and chirping oi the com- 
puters^ the snapping noises of hot 
metal, the soft hiss of air through 
the ducts, the faint whir pumps 
on the exchangeis, the hum of 
heating elements, the click of re- 
lays, the rush of fluid in the pipes 
and hydraulic lines, the faint whine 
of servo motors and the deeper hum 
of the generators, all were silent. 
The lack of noise grated on his 
nerves. 

The supposedly impregnable sta- 
tion had a soft spot in its defenses. 
Cut off its power supply, and it was 
helpless. He felt his way through 
the darkness into his quarters and 
took his pistol from the top drawer 
of his dresser. His fingers curled 
comfortably around its handgrip, as 
his lips quirked with mild amuse- 
ment. Any outfit sophisticated 
enough to put the island out of ac- 
tion wojild certainly have the answer 
to so elemental a weapon as a gun. 

But would they have the answer 
to the other defenses? Every other 
minute an IFF signal flashed out 
from the station to Kennedy, and 
every alternate minute a signal came 
from Kennedy to the station. In- 
terruption of two successive signals 
would ring an alarm stateside, and 
an operator would try to contact the 
island. No contact and three more 
missed signals would cause a missle 
to be fired, and fifteen minutes later 
Friday Island would vanish from the 
face of the Earth. 

The Station jarred sickeningly on 
its foundations, and Bruce was sud- 
denly plastered immovably against 
the floor, pinned down like an in- 



52 



IF 




sect on a board. Gravity? — Ac- 
celeration? And Bruce knew that 
there was also a solution to the 
thermonuclear explosion — get the 
station out of the way — fast! But 
how far could they go in the eight- 
een-odd minutes that would elapse 
between the time the missile was fired 
and the time it hit the target? Judg- 
ing from the acceleration — real far. 
Maybe even out of this world. 

It was dark, quiet and very cold. 
And with each passing minute it be- 
came colder. Bruce couldn’t move. 
He lay flattened against the floor, 
his heart pumping slowly and 
laboriously, forcing his heavy blood 
through half-collapsed vessels. It was 
almost impossible to breathe and 
nearly impossible to think. A gray 
curtain hung over his vision. He 
gasped and tried to roll over. He 
couldn’t. And the gray curtain be- 
came thicker and enveloped him en- 
tirely. 

He awoke with the nightmare feel- 
ing of floating. But it was no night- 
mare. He was floating. He was naked 
in a decontamination booth, floating 
in a drizzling spray of something 
acrid and astringent. It smelled 
vaguely of sulfur and made him 
want to cough. 

Sulfur? — brimstone? — Hell? 
He ruled out that possibility. He 
didn’t believe in Hell. 

U 

T he spray stopped. A sphincterlike 
door dilated in one wall (ceil- 
ing? — floor?), and something 
came through it. It wasn’t human 
even though it walked on two legs, 



had a reasonably human hairless 
head, binocular vision and hands 
with opposable thumbs. Humans 
don’t have four arms or eyes with 
oval pupils like a goat. But other- 
wise it didn’t differ much. It was 
about four feet tall, and it looked 
intelligent. It was clothed in a tunic 
belted loosely at the waist. The belt 
supported something that looked like 
a pistol. A bright red box hung over 
its midsection from a strap around its 
neck. At it walked toward Bruce, it 
began to make noises. 

“Whistle burble grunt chitter 
whistle CHEEP grunt?” it said. 

And the red box in uninflected, 
accentless English said “Now you 
are clean, we can talk. Are you 
hurt?” 

“No.” Bruce said. It wasn’t hard 
to see what was wrong with this pic- 
ture. He was floating weightless in 
free fall. The alien was standing on 
its feet and walking. It had an unfair 
advantage. 

“That is good. It is our policy not 
to be unkind to inferior races un- 
less it is necessary.” 

“Inferior?” Bruce asked on a ris- 
ing note. 

“Obviously. Your technology is of 
a low order. You have a little civili- 
zation and many cultures. Your plan- 
et is the standard barbarian type we 
find this far out on the galactic 
rim.” 

“All right, have it your way,” 
Bruce said, “so what do you want of 
us?” 

“Information at the moment. You 
have nothing else we want. We 
wish to investigate. Later we shall 
determine how you can be made

useful to our plans in the future.” 
‘^Do you mean what I think yciu 
do?” I 

“It depends on what you think. 
Be patient, and I shall explain,” the 
alien said. It waved one of its left 
hands at the open doorway. “We 
shall study your machines. Tlien we 
shall study you. The data will be 
added to data we have already ac- 
quired from long-range surveys, and 
we shall have a fair guess of your 
maximum capability. Later we shall 
obtain other specimens of your race 
and study them to find out what 
methods can be efficiently used to 
make you cooperate with us. You 
have certain mechanical skills that 
might be useful. You could have 
metals or other things that we might 
use. Time will tell.” 

“If you have some crazy idea of 
conquering us, you won’t get away 
with it,” Bruce said. “If you think 
you can, you just don’t understand 
the human race.” 

“Others have said that,” the alien 
said. “Most of them submitted at 
once when they understood the al- 
ternative. If we must, we will reduce 
your number to a minimum and re- 
place your present savageries with 
a better culture. But it is slow work 
to repopulate an empty world. We 
would prefer to use what the Ulti- 
mate Intelligence has provided.” 
“That is generous of you.” 

“We are a generous race. Ask any 
of our servants.” 

“You are going to be a very dead 
race, if my people have anything to 
say about it.” 

“By now they will have nothing to 
say. We should be well beyond any

IF 



feeble reprisal your fellows might 
take, but even if we were not, your 
race will not find us. We can bend 
and radiation around us and 
r^nain invisible. In fact we are do- 
ing it now. You could come within 
a few feet of the ship and never 
sense us unless you have mass-de- 
tection devices.” The alien shrugged 
its upper shoulders. It was a startling 
effect. ‘‘But enough of that,” it said. 
“I come to take you out of here. 
Until we finish our study of you, 
we would prefer you to be healthy. 
We have moved your living quarters 
from your building to our ship. 
Everything is ready for you.” 

“And if I resist?” 

“Then I will stun you and tow 
you. You will be no problem.” 
“You’re right,” Bruce said, “I 
won’t. Not now.” 

The alien maneuvered him through 
the sjtoKJter and down a transpar- 
ent hallway lined with banks of what 
looked like filter panels. They passed 
through two interlocks — which 
were only roughly similar to those 
on Earth — and down a corridor that 
gave an odd impression of flexibility 
and porosity, through a third inter- 
lock and into an opaque corridor 
lined with contracted sphincter- 
doors. The alien stopped before one 
of them, opened it and pushed Bruce 
inside. “Your personal things have 
already been examined,” it said. “We 
have removed the weapons, but for 
the rest you will find them undam- 
aged. And in the meantime this may 
n>ake you more ownfortable.” It 
took a bright coppery square of metal 
from inside its tunic and laid it on 
the floor. “Carry this on your per- 



son,” it continued. “You will not 
float.” 

“So how do I get to it?” Bruce 
asked. 

“That is your problem,” the alien 
said as it stepped through the 
sphincter and disappeared. 

44T^or every reaction,” Bruce 
mutter^, “there is an equal 
and opposite reaction.” Newton 
proposed the law a century and a 
half ago, but it wasn’t going to do 
him much good. The aliens had 
stripped him to the skin. Had they 
but left him his slippers he would 
be down to that piece of red metal 
in a moment. By throwing them in 
one direction he would travel in the 
other. But he had nothing. He 
thought for a moment and then 
grinned. Maybe he could swim. 
After all, air had some resistance. 

It had. A couple of minutes of 
sculling with cupped hands brought 
him down to the piece of metal. He 
touched it and promptly sprawled on 
the floor. He picked the thing up, 
stood up and went across the cubicle 
to where his dresser was set against 
the wall. He sigjied happily as he 
opened a drawer and took out a pair 
of coveralls. Ihere were slippers in 
another drawer, and in a few minutes 
he was dressed and infinitely more 
at ease. There was something about 
clothes that restored his confidence. 

As a routine preliminary, Bruce 
tested the walls, ceiling, floor and 
door. They were all solid. The door 
was closed tightly and would not 
open. He looked at the walls and 
ceiling. There was nothing of im- 
portance; air intake and exhaust 



A HAIR PERHAPS 



55 




ducts in the ivall opposite the door, 
three lenses and a peculiar luminous 
in the ceiling. The air was faint- 
ly sulfurous, but breathable. Over 
the long run it might be harmful, 
but Bruce didn’t think he’d be around 
that long. 

Bruce tested the installations. 
None of the plumbing worked which 
was to be expected, but the elec- 
trical appliances operated perfectly. 

“Well,” he said. “That’s some- 
thing.” He trailed the wires to neat 
needlelike plugs which penetrated 
the wall. “Hmm — good way to 
wire — gets rid of fixed sockets. 
Walls like these would be some- 
thing building contractors would sell 
their souls for, if they could be built 
economically.” 

Bruce ran his fingers over the 
stubble on his chin. It felt heavy — 
like a full day’s growth. “It’s a hellu- 
va time for shaving, but I’d better 
do it before I begin to look like one 
©f the the Smith Brothers,” he mut- 
tered as he opened the medicine 
closet over the wash bowl and took 
out his electric razor. “Anyway it’ll 
give my four-armed friends some- 
thing to think about.” 

Feeling a little better, Bruce con- 
tinued his search for weapons. It 
was a perfectly natural reaction. In- 
deed, it would have been out of 
character had he not done so. Among 
the first things he examined was 
the station’s portable transceiver 
which he kept in his quarters. The 
radio was dead except for a faint 
crackle of static, which argued plau- 
sibly that if no radio waves came in, 
none would get out. Yet on the 
chance they might, he broadcast an 



appeal for help and planned to re^ 
it every hour. He grimaced a 
little. He had a mental picture oi 
chuckling aliens watching him 
through the lenses in the ceiling. 

He checked the rest of his gear for 
possibilities. The aliens had taken 
his gun, but there was a refrigera- 
tor, a stove, a vacuum cleaner, a 
coffee pot, an electric toothbrush, a 
toaster, a waffle iron and a flash- 
light. This certainly wasn’t the sort 
of stuff with which wars were won 
he thought ruefully. The refrigerator 
would have been a possibility had 
it been one of the old fashioned 
freon or ammonia kind. The gas 
could perhaps be poisonous to aliens. 
But this box was a direct heat ex- 
changer and didn’t use refrigerant, 
a nice ultramodern gadget with zero 
possibilities as a weapon. Something 
conceivably could be done to the 
stove to convert it into an instru- 
ment for electrocuting the unwary, 
but that possibility was remote. He 
looked at the stove and shook his 
head. Scratch that thought. It simply 
couldn’t be done. As for the rest of 
the stuff, it had no use as far as he 
could see. Any weapon he could 
make would have to be elemental, 
something like a club. Ah yes — a 
chair leg. Bruce upended his chair 
and looked at it. The metal legs 
screwed into the seat. They could 
be easily removd to give him four 
tapered pieces of tubing two inches 
in diameter at the base, three quar- 
ters of an inch at the tip and a 
foot and a half long. They would 
be very satisfactory, providing some- 
thing came close enough to be clob- 
bered. He set the chair aside and 



56 



IF 




went to the bed. The sheets could be 
t^rn into strips and made into an 
adequate rope which one could use 
to tie clobbered bodies and keep 
them helpless. The electric cord from 
the blanket controls would make a 
fine garotte. There was enough ma- 
terial for weapons if he kept them 
simple. 

W ith surprise and a little luck 
he should be able to immobi- 
lize and disarm an alien. Then, with 
the alien’s weapon he could do con- 
siderably more damage. He just 
might make it hot enough for them 
to think twice before trying to sub- 
jugate men. He didn’t believe the 
talk about depopulating Earth. That 
was the sort of thing authors wrote 
about in science fiction. 

But what could create a diversion? 
His neck itched. Absently he 
scratched it. A few stray hairs from 
his recent shave were irritating his 
skin. Hmm, that was an idea. Maybe 
if he dumped shaving dust into the 
air ducts he could cause a diversion. 
At any rate it was worth trying. But 
it was a big ship, and although he 
could collect quite a bit of hair from 
shaving, it probably would not be 
enough to cause significant damage. 
However, he would give the idea 
the old college try and use every- 
thing he had. There was no sense in 
doing a half-baked job. By shaving 
his body as well as his face and 
head, he would probably double the 
amount of available hair, and that 
just might be enough to provide a 
good diversion if there was no in- 
ternal filtering system. At best, it 
could give him a certain advantage 



by producing allergic reactions in 
the enemy. At worst it would only 
be a waste of time. 

He set about reducing his hair to 
powder. It was a harder task than 
he thought. An electric razor de- 
signed for beards is a poor clipper 
for other kinds of hair, but after a 
fashion it worked. In some cases he 
had to compromise on short lengths, 
clipped with scissors rather than the 
fine powdery razor residue he would 
have preferred. But at last the task 
was done and the few grams of hair, 
dumped into the room exhaust. All 
that he could do now was wait — 
and unscrew die legs of the chair.

a coughing alien appeared in the half- 
open sfdiincter. He carried a plastic 
bottle full of liquid, and as he set it 
inside the rocnn, a hacking paroxysm 
turned his yellowish face a dark crim- 
son. Bruce looked at him, ^nned 
and f^ked up a chair leg. He was in 
business. 

Three hours later he controlled 
the ^p. Behind him lay a trail of 
dead, dying, bound and gagged aliens 
tucked away in dark corners, and 
his chair leg was bent, dented and 
splashed with the alien equivalent 
of blood. He scowled as he tied an 
alien into one of the control chairs 
in the operations center. This was 
the last he could find. It had been 
hiding in one of the equipment lock- 
ers, but its coughing had given it 
away. 

His hair had worked too well. The 
shorter pieces got on skin and into 
lungs causing allergic reactions and 
severe bronchial irritation. Predic- 
tably, none of the aliens realized 
what was happening until it was too 
late. 

The longer pieces sabotaged the 
ship’s mechanisms, and this Bruce 
didn’t really expect. He knew, of 
course, that dust and debris could 
affect the performance of delicate 
instruments and machinery, but what 
happened to the alien ship seemed 
entirely out of line compared with 
the cause. The confusion was in- 
credible. Nothing worked properly. 
Lights sputtered and faded, circuits 
shorted, servos labored or ran at in- 
sane speeds. Rotors stuck, shafts 
seized, switches and relays failed to 
work. Solenoids didn’t operate, ther- 
mocouples failed to register, tubes 



shorted out, armatures smoked, wir- 
ing arced, niicroniiniaturized circuits 
melted. It was shambles. 

He had thoroughly disabled the 
alien spaceship. 

He poked Hhe alien with his bat- 
tered club. He hadn’t tried to use 
an alien weapon after one of them 
had incinerated its owner as it was 
trying to shoot him. 

The alien grunted and coughed. 
To Bruce that alien was interesting 
only because it wore a translator and 
could talk. Otherwise, he would not 
have wasted time on it. He didn’t 
think much of the aliens anyway. 
They were thoroughly inefficient 
combat types without their gadgets. 
Possibly if he knew them better he 
could find some more positive quali- 
ties. As it was, they were that face- 
less thing called “the enemy,’’ some- 
thing that had to be incapacitated 
without any emotional involvement. 

T he alien coughed and shook its 
hairless head. “Why don’t you 
kill me?” it asked. 

“I have no reason to,” Bruce said, 
“besides you might be useful.” 
“How?” 

“You could explain these con- 
trols.” 

“Do you think I would?” 

Bruce shook his head. “No,” he 
said, “not voluntarily. But there are 
other ways of getting answers.” 
‘Torture will do you no good.” 
“Do you think I am that un- 
civilized?” 

“You attacked us with a biologic 
weapon against which we had no de- 
fense. You may have killed us all. 
That is uncivilized.” 



58 



IF 




“What did you expect me to do? 
Sit still while you killed me?” 

“We would not have killed you,” 
the alien said, “But I don’t suppose 
you could be expected to believe 
that. As a member of a racial com- 
plex with high culture, but low 
civilization, you would expect to be 
tortured or killed. Civilized races 
have other and better ways of get- 
ting at the truth or developing in- 
formation. You would not have been 
hurt.” 

“Then what was all that talk about 
killing us off?” 

“Racial only. We would have seed- 
ed your world with an organism 
which would have prevented the 
great majority of you from repro- 
ducing. In a few generations your 
huge, untidy population would have 
been reduced to manageable size. 
But we would not have destroyed a 
single one of your lives. We merely 
would have prevented new ones.” 

“Which in the end would make lit- 
tle difference,” Bruce said, “it would 
still be genocide.” 

“No — there would be a small 
proportion of your population that 
would be immune. Not all of you 
would be killed, nor would your race 
be extinguished. Your survivors 
would be educated to fit into our 
plans, and in a thousand years you 
probably would be as numerous as 
you are now.” 

“Oddly enough, I believe you,” 
Bruce said. “Not that it makes any 
difference.” 

“You are right. It makes no dif- 
ference. In a few years the absence 
of our ship will be noticed, and a 
task force will be sent to cover the 



same route we have traveled. They 
will encounter you, and this will not 
happen a second time. Things will be 
different.” 

“They will indeed,” Bruce said. 

“Had we suspected that you were 
so different from us,” the alien said, 
“we would have taken greater pre- 
cautions. We assumed correctly that 
you were a bloodthirsty barbarian, 
but we made the error of equating 
your group reactions with your in- 
dividual ability. You see, in our so- 
ciety, the group action is a direct re- 
flection of the individuals composing 
the group. In yours it is not. We 
assumed that you were lazy, hesi- 
tant, cowardly, stupid, dilatory and 
dirty. But somehow you are not.” 
The alien struggled, gasped, coughed 
rackingly and sagged with exhaustion 
when the spasm passed. 

“I do not understand you,” it 
muttered. 

“The feeling is mutual,” Bruce 
said. He looked at the three boards 
in the room. They were obviously 
designed to be operated by three 
aliens — and quite probably the 
three worked as a unit, synchroniz- 
ing their activities. It was also quite 
probable that the central board had 
control of the major activities of 
the ship, while the two other boards 
each controlled a hemisphere. Of 
course, that might not be the case at 
all. Alien logic and positioning prob- 
ably was not similar to human. 

As they were now, the three boards 
were not designed to give anyone 
peace of mind. They smoked, sput- 
tered and occasionally made noises 
and flashed lights. They behaved as 
no control boards should.

I f he were an alien, Bruce reflected, 
be would be worried by the ac- 
tions of the boards. As it was, he 
was terrified. 

. “For your sake,” Bruce said not 
unkindly, “I will allow you to tell 
me how to shut off these boards.” 
“I appreciate your offer,” the alien 
said with equal politeness, “but I 
will not tell you. Figure it out your- 
self. It should be instructive. The 
odds are about twenty-to-one against 
your success.” 

“And — ” 

“If you fail, we are destroyed. And 
just in case you wish to leave things 
as they are, sooner or later we will 
have a key malfunction which will 
destroy us.” 

“And this makes you happy?” 
“No. But it will keep our ship and 
our technology out of your hands. 
Primitive as you are, you could still 
make use of many of our devices. 
You understand the elements of solid- 
state physics, and your electronics 
are adequate.” There was no longer 
a note of contempt in the alien’s 
voice. It was as if, having chosen to 
die, the alien saw no reason for try- 
ing to be chauvinistic. It cough^ 
again and thrashed violently in the 
chair where Bruce had tied it. The 
paroxysm ceased, and the alien sank 
back, breathing heavily. 

“I really have no desire to die 
messily”, it said. “Only in battle 
does a messy death allow me an un- 
marred place with my ancestors. 
And the action on this ship may 
not be a battle in the strict sense of 
the word.” 

“Then tell,” said Bruce, “and live 
to fight another day.” 



“No, I must assume that this is 
war.” 

“Well then,” Bruce said, “I’ll have 
to go it alone.” He reached a hand 
toward the switchboard and watched 
the alien n^owly. The alien gave 
no sign of tension. There was a light 
burning over the switch. He turned 
the switch, and the light went out. 
Four switches later, the alien tensed. 
Bruce left this one alone and went 
on. By the time Bruce had nearly 
finish^ the board, the alien dis- 
covered what the man was doing. It 
thereupon closed its eyes, tensed 
its muscles and waited impassively. 

By now, however, Bruce was ac- 
quainted with the rationale of the 
board. It was similar to what a man 
might construct. The color codes 
were different, and the groupings 
were probably entirely different; but 
there were main switches for each 
section, and these Bruce could recog- 
nize and operate. One after another 
he turned them off until the alien 
ship floated dark and dead in an 
orbit around the Earth. 

“And now what do you plan to 
do?” the alien asked from the dark- 
ness. 

“Wait until we are rescued,” 
Bruce said, “Now that everything 
on this ship is turned off it probably 
looms up on every tracking radar 
system on Earth that is within range. 
In about twenty-four hours we will 
have visitors, and personally I don’t 
give a damn whether they speak Rus- 
sian or English. You and your kind 
hold a threat for my world that is 
bigger than nationalism or ideology. 
We will have to co-operate to keep

people of Earth would co-operate. 
He would see to that. And he would 
live to watch them form one world 
to repel invasion from space, by soul- 
less aliens bent on genocide. 

The alien’s coughing stopped 
abruptly. Bruce fumbled in the pock- 
et of his coveralls and found his 
flashlight. He turned the beam on 
the alien. It was dead; a thin trickle 
of blood ran from the lax mouth, 
and the goat’s eyes stared glassily. 

Bruce shrugged. By the time help 
came, he might be the only one alive. 

Actually, that might not be a bad 
thing. It would leave him as the 
only man who had experience with 
the aliens; and since he probably 
would be an international hero be- 
cause of his incredible success against 
overwhelming odds, he would be ask- 
ed to speak, and he’d be heard. 

He rose slowly to his feet and 
started walking back to the room the 
aliens had prepared for him. He 
would need the portable transceiver, 
and he might have to rig some sort 
of antenna that would let him broad- 
cast. And as he walked he considered 
the stories he’d tell a waiting world. 

They would neither be kindly nor 
absolutely truthful. They would paint 
the aliens blacker than they were 
and make them into figures of ter- 
ror. Considering their bizarre appear- 
ance, this should not be too hard 
to do. And since he was neither kind- 
ly nor absolutely truthful, he would 
be perfectly capable of watching his 
fellow men squirm as long as they 
squirmed in unison. He grinned at a 
thought which flashed across his 
mind. With some justice, he could be 
considered a hairy character. END

— STILL MORE FANDOMS 

by LIN CARTER 



Our A4an in Fondom guides us to more 
fandoms than you — or that fellow 
Horatio, either — ever dreamed of! 



L ast issue, gang, we were 
talking about some of the little 
fandoms that exist within science- 
fiction fandom. The idea was, SF 
fans read other stuff, too, and some 
writers have a charm, a charisma, 
so potent and exciting that cults 
grow up around them and their 
stories. The examples I used were 
the groups devoted to Edgar Rice 
Burroughs, the creator of What’s- 
His-Name of the Apes and John 
(no relation to this writer) Carter 
of Mars, and Robert E. Howard, 
whose glorious barbarian warrior- 
hero, Conan the Cimmerian, is now 
swaggerin’ and swashbuoMn’ all 
over your paperback stands. 

Of course, the great-grandfather 
of all these one-writer fandoms is 
the group that sprang up around 
Conan Doyle — Sir Arthur Conan 
Doyle to you (and no relation to the 
above Cimmerian hero). His Sher- 
lock Holmes stories created what 
must probably be the World’s First 
Fandom, and many sd^Kre^fiction 
people are devoted to ihe Sacred 



Writings, as the Holmes stories are 
known in Irregular circles. 

The Boys From Baker Street 

The Baker Street Irregulars, that 
is. This circle of Doyle-devotees 
grew up in the 1930’s, started by 
a bunch of lit’ry chaps like Christo- 
pher Morley and Vincent Starrett. 
Today, the Irregulars are big-time, 
indeed. There are local groups — 
called “scion societies” — scattered 
all over the country and abroad, 
as well. These local chapters take 
their names from one or another of 
the stories in the Canon: such as 
The Speckled Band of Boston, the 
Copper Beeches of Philadelphia, The 
Diogenes Club, the Hounds of the 
Baskerville. There is more than one 
local chapter here in New York, 
but the one whose meetings I have 
attended most frequently, and to 
which so many local science-^fiction 
fans belong, is called The Priory 
Scholars of New York. 

The boys from Baker Street pub- 



63 



lish a hefty and handsome journal 
of notes, news, critica and opinions 
called The Baker Street Journal, 
which comes out quarterly. The Ir- 
regulars in various local chapters 
dso publish their own newsletters 
and correspond with other mem- 
bers. Once a year, on the supposed 
“birthday” of Sherlock Holmes (it 
is very Irregular to pretend Holmes 
really lived and that Watson wrote 
the stories, using Doyle merely as 
an agent), which they have worked 
out to be Friday, January 6, 1854, 
there is a get-together of members. 
I don’t 'believe it’s large enough to 
call a convention, exactly, but they 
have fun meeting and talking, mak- 
ing new friends, and drinking a 
toast to the Master. 

The Cabellians 

Another charismatic writer who 
has a burgeoning little fandom all 
of his own is the distinguished 
American fantasy novelist, James 
Branch Cabell, the author of several 
of the most brilliant, urbane and 
imaginative fantasies of the 20th 
Century (such as The Silver Stallion 
and Something About Eve and The 
Cream of the Jest and — his mas- 
terpiece — the immortal Jurgen), 
Cabell was very popular and highly 
regarded by the critics (such as 
H. L. Mencken, who wrote a whole 
book about him) back in the 1920’s. 
Today, he seems to be largely ig- 
nored, almost forgotten. But a hard 
core of dedicated Poictesmois are 
about to do something about that. 

Spearhead of this movement 
would seem to be a science-fiction 

64 



fan named James N. Hall, 202 Tay- 
lor Avenue, Crystal City, Missouri, 
63019. Jim and his son, Dave Hall, 
and a few other people put out an 
irregular (no relation to above 
Baker St. boys) fanzine for, by and 
of Cabell fans called Kalki. It seems 
to be free to anyone who wants it. 
The latest issue I have seen dis- 
cusses Cabell’s possible influence 
on H. P. Lovecraft’s little-known 
novel. Dream Quest of Unknown 
Kadath, Jack Vance’s The Dying 
Earth and The Dragon Masters, 
and other ‘books. Hall is using his 
fanzine as a medium for getting in 
touch with other Cabell fans across 
the country, and as he says he 
thinks time is ripe to begin a sort 
of sulnfandom comparable to the 
Hyborian Legion and the Burroughs 
Bibliophiles. I agree. 

The Ozmopolitans 

Another fannish in-group is de- 
voted to L. Frank Baum, the fam- 
ous author of The Wizard of Oz* 
Now almost everybody has read The 
Wizard of Oz — it is the greatest 
American fairy tale ever written — 
but L. Frank Baum also wrote other 
Oz books; and when he died in 1919, 
the series was continued by Ruth 
Plumly Thompson, by Jack Snow, 
by John R. Neill, Rachel Cosgrove, 
and other authors. People who are 
only aware of The Wizard of Oz 
may be surprised to learn there are 
42 Oz books in all! 

There is a very large and live Oz 
fandom operating. A nation-wide 
club has been in existence for some 
years now. It suffers under the 



IF 




raliieir diUdisih (oaiine of **The In- 
ternational ^zaid of Oz Fan 
Ouib,” but we sbanH bold tbait 
atgainst it Burr IUsstront Ibe TV 
personality, creator of Kukla, Fran 
and OUie, the novelist Philip Wylie, 
critic and book reviewer Anthony 
Boucher (co^founder and co-editor 
of The Magazine of Fantasy and 
Science Fiction)^ writer Martin 
Gardner (author of The Annotated 
Alice and other marvelous books) 
and a number of sdence-fiotion peo- 
ple belong to this dub. 

Every June the Oz fans hold a 
national convention at “Ozcot” on 
Bass Lake, Indiana, the home of 
Harry Baum, only surviving son of 
the writer. At this year’s convention 
they had a banquet with an Ozzy 
menu, an auction of rare Oz col- 
lectors’ items and a showing of two 
of the incredibly rare silent-screen 
movies that L. Frank Baum made, 
the Scarecrow and the Patchwork 
Girl of Oz> These films, long be- 
lieved irretrievably lost, have re- 
cently been discovered. Baum wrote 
the scenarios and directed them him- 
self. About 50 people attended the 
convention, and there are around 
500 members in the club now. 

Three times a year the club pub- 
lishes a handsome magazine. The 
Baum Bugle, which is edited by 
Fred Meyer in Escanaba, Michi- 
gan. The most recent issue I have 
seen featured on its coyer a full- 
color painting famous Oz illustrator 
John R. Neill did for one of the 
books; but it was lost in the pub- 
lisher’s files and never published 
until resurrected and print^ in the 
Bugle, 



A New York science-fiction and 
Oz fan, Hal Lynch, tells me there 
has ibeen at leak one local Oz dub 
meeting here in New York (that 
was a couple of years ago, at the 
Long Island home of Donald A. 
Wollheim, editor-dn-^hief of Ace 
Books and a long-time Oz fan)^ 
but that a local group in Los An- 
geles is quite active and holds fre- 
quent meetings. 

Comics Fandom 

And then there are the comic- 
book fans. They sourd to me like 
the largest, most adive of the 
“other” fandoms right now. It seems 
that in the early 1950’s, a New York 
sdence^fiction fan, Bhob Stewart, 
started a fanzine called The E.C, 
Fan Bulletin, dedicated to the 
sdence-fantasy comic books pub- 
lished by E.C. Publications. This 
was the first comic-book fan maga- 
zine, but far — mighty far! — from 
being the last. There are, in fact, 
about 40 or 50 such magazines go- 
ing at this time. Not all of them 
are devoted to the E.C. comics, of 
course. A local comics and science- 
fiction fan tells me that the most 
prominent magazines now publish- 
ing are Alter Ego and Fantasy Illus- 
trated, Alter Ego is edited by Roy 
Thomas, a writer for the Marvel 
Comics line, and it is largely de- 
voted to critical studies and articles 
on the various super-heroes — 
hence the title. (A better title might 
be Phonebooth,) 

Fantasy Illustrated, whose editor 
is Bill Spicer, features comic art 
and letters. Spicer also publishes a 



THE ''OTHERS' FANDOMS 



65 




booklet called The Guide to Comics 
Fandom for 50c. This contains a 
history of this sub-fandom and has 
lots of information on the fans, lists 
their fanzines, etc. If you are in- 
terested in comic books. Bill’s ad- 
dress is 4878 Granada Street, Los 
Angeles, Calif., 90042. 

There are national comics clubs 
going, such as the Academy of 
Comic Book Fans and Collectors. 
There is even an apa (amateur 
press association: a club for fan- 
zine publishers) devoted to comics 
fandom, called KAPA-ALPHA I 
believe. It got started in 1964 and 
now has about 30 contributing mem- 
bers. And there’s a new national 
club opening up called INCAS (In- 
ternational Comic Art Society) 
which publishes a magazine called 
The Cartoonist, selling for 75c, fea- 
turing art, biographies, history, 
origins, articles, movie info and so 
on. If you’re interested, write to 
INCAS, P.O. Box 1281, Hollywood, 
Calif., 90028. 

Comic-book fandom may be new 
on the scene, but it’s certainly tak- 
ing off in all directions under a 
full head of steam. There was a 
national convention here in New 
York City at the Park-Sheraton Ho- 
tel on July 23rd and 24th. This 
“Comics Con” was quite a lively 
and star^tudded show. Present were 
old-time science-fiction writer Otto 
Binder (who used to write Captain 
Marvel and now writes Superman) 
and the famous comic artist Jack 
Kirby (he drew Captain America 
and The Boy Commandos and many 
other favorites of the ’40’s; he now 



does The Fantastic Four), who was 
Guest of Honor, and Gil Kane (he 
draws The Green Lantern), Jerry 
De Fuccio (an editor for Mad), and 
loads of other exciting people . » 
not to mention Bhob Stewart, now 
a staff artist for Castle of Franken- 
stein, the guy who virtually started 
the whole thing. 

Like the ordinary science-fiction 
conventions, there were speeches 
and panel discussions and an auction 
of rare comic books, original comic 
art and all sorts of interesting items 
(including some original Batman TV 
scripts). The Comics Con showed 
movies, too; a chapter each of sev- 
eral old movie serials which were 
made back in the ’40’s from the 
adventures of some of the comics 
characters like Flash Gordon and 
Captain America and Captain Mar- 
vel, plus a very early TV Superman 
episode, showing his origin on the 
planet Krypton. 

I am fascinated by these sub-fan- 
doms. Of course, most people in 
science fiction are interested in other 
things besides just science fiction 
. naturally . but it’s exciting 
to think that if you happen to be 
fond of a particular writer or hob- 
by, and you can find just a handful 
of other people who share your 
enthusiasm, you can start the ball 
rolling and end up with something 
so big it publishes 50 fanzines and 
has national conventions! (How 
about it out there, gang? Anybody 
interested in starting an A. Merritt 
club, or a Sax Rohmer Society, or 
maybe an //.'-Rcaders-of- America?)

The 

Scared Starship 

by D. Me MELTON 

Illustrated by MODEL 

Strange place for a starship, 
at the bottom of a hole. Not 
only strange, but very deadlyl 



I 

A fter the Mariner probes and the 
first touch-and-go landings, we 
thought we knew about what we 
would find on Mars. 

Desert, of course, and minerals, 
some of which make the Geigers 
sing. And Sino-Sov people. At the 
Delhi conference we had agreed to 
confine ourselves to a specific area, 
as had the Sino-Sov Bloc. But we 
expected to find them, too, and 



eventually did. What we did not ex- 
pect was that we would find a star- 
ship. 

I shouldn’t mislead you. We still 
have to build the starship. What we 
actually found was something — 
Margot Harris insists I should say 
some one — that knows how to 
build one and is telling us. 

Dave Ellis and I found it That 
was mostly luck. But Captain Soott 
and Hank Owen used brains and 
guts when they kept Mao Lee and 



67 





his hatchetmen from hijacking it. 
And it was Margot’s brains and in- 
sight, and her temper, which finally 
convinced us of what we really had. 
But Dave and I lucked our way to 
discovery, about four weeks out on a 
mapping and exploration trek. Cap- 
tain Scott had taken four of us. It 
was dull work, but we were getting 
it done. 

Margot, this trip, was the carto- 
grapher. And Hank Owen, geologist, 
mineralogist and sourpuss, was tuck- 
ing away a lot of promising samples. 
Dave ElUs had the gravy-train job. 
He can do almost anything, but this 
trip he was keeping a photographic 
log. 

His pictures of our departure 
weren’t very impressive, even if he 
did manage to shoot an inordinate 
amount of footage of Margot. A 
pressure suit doesn’t do her justice. 
Inside the dome it’s a different view, 
for as engineer-astronauts go she’s a 
shade disconcerting. She’s titian 
haired, amber eyed, wanton shaped 
and five feet tall on tiptoe. But she 
can hold her own in any company. 
In fact if you make her mad, so the 
freckles show and the hair looks like 
flame over a white Ming vase, even 
a hardnosed launch-pad lead man 
has been known to step back to re- 
appraise the situation. 

But Dave’s pictures showed us 
for what we were — improvised, with 
the spot welds showing. Antigrav 
isn’t what it will be in another twenty 
years. It’s about as far along relative- 
ly as a Goddard rocket and will hft a 
payload about as far. So everything 
has to be pushed up to us the hard 
way» a piece at a time, and some 



senators grump it’s too costly. Or 
did. Not any more. But we had 
pieced together a big closed barge 
with antigrav lift. It carried an ade- 
quate reactor-generator, a must, be- 
cause the G-Units drink power hke 
the city of Seattle. We did the leg 
work with a couple of antigrav 
sleds, powered by broadcast power 
from the barge, with soUd fuel push- 
pots for emergencies. 

F our weeks out, Dave and I were 
bored and drowsy and looking 
at another big outcropping of ob- 
sidian which showed above the rim 
of a crater. 

The ridge looked like a hundred 
others, only bigger. Dave asked me 
to take him over for a look at the 
other side. I lifted up and over and 
was floating back along the outside 
rim, when all of a sudden I woke 
up fast, my reflexes taking over be- 
fore my brain knew what had hap- 
pened. I was fresh out . of power! 
The sled tilted, dropping like rock; 
and glancing down I thought it 
would be a close thing, if we made 
it at all. 

Dave didn’t move, except to cradle 
his camera in his lap. He’s the skin- 
ny, thin-haired, hung-over-looking 
newsman type. I think he did news 
work while he was at M.I.T. One 
of his gag hnes is, “I’m no hero. I 
just take pictures of ’em!” — not 
mentioning that the photographer 
has to be there, too, usually with 
his back to the opposition. So he 
just sat, looking bored, and I got 
the pushpots balanced before any 
bones or cameras were broken. Then 
he grinned, “Always grandstanding! 




You could have picked it up meters 
from that ledge instead of centi- 
meters. You play the damnedest 
games, Rainbowl” 

I was about to tell him he was one 
stupid remark up on me, but there 
wasn’t time. For I hadn’t been play- 
ing. And I haven’t fought anybody 
about that nickname since I was 
twelve. In fact I like it better now 
than “John.” “Rainbow” Smith sort 
of sets me apart from the hundreds 
of plain John Smiths. And I’m down- 
right happy about my eyes, even 
though the fact that one of them is 
blue-and-brown and the other is gray- 
and-green accounts for the nickname. 

My rainbow eyes arc unusual in 
another way, too. I nearly got busted 
out of training when my instructors 
learned I was eyeballing my rendez- 
vous manuevers instead of letting 
radar do it. That was supposed to 
come later. But dead-on depth per- 
ception is handy for an astropilot. 
And the fact that I grew up on a 
series of surfboards on the Santa 
Barbara coast, and at Makaha, did 
things for my reflexes, too. So I 
wasn’t even thinking about those 
glass ridges which are jumping up 
at me as I got the pushpots flaring 
and skimmed away from the ledge. 
That was routine. 

What I was wondering about was 
the power failure. The board said 
that for thirty seconds something had 
intercepted my power beam. And 
that just isn’t in the book. The beam 
is tight, keyed to one specific receiv- 
er. The pushpots are for possible fail- 
ure at the barge. And that isn’t in 
the book either. 

I hovered and looked. There was 



nothing down there but that obsidian 
hogback, with «and drifted on the 
craiter side clear to the top. Outside, 
most of the eand had drifted away. 
That’s right The air on Mars is so 
diin you’ll look very unpretty indeed 
if your suit opens and exposes yon 
to it. But in stormy weather the sand 
will drift. But there was nothing 
down there to steal my power. I 
was wondering if there was a Sino- 
Sov sled around, with an advanced 
power thief. We knew Colonel Rost- 
off. He didn’t play much dirtier than 
his orders spelled out. But Captain 
Mao Lee had been known to im- 
provise. He didn’t even like his al- 
lies, much less us. I was about to 
say so when Dave said, “Hold it, 
Rainbow. A fumarole down there.” 

W e had found a few, volcanic 
blow holes formed in the glass 
when it was liquid and Mars was 
venting its little remaining core heat 
to the surface. But this was a big 
one, not quite covered by the sand. 
I edged forward, set this time for a 
possible power loss. It came, right 
on time. The pushpots stirred some 
dust, and the sand started flowing 
downhill, away from the cavern 
mouth. Then Dave yelled, slapped his 
telephoto setting and told me he 
would black both my beautiful multi- 
colored eyes if I let the sled wobble 
as much as a centimeter. He used 
several hundred feet of tape on a 
dark object which was being re- 
vealed by the flowing sand. Then he 
lowered the camera and said, “Holy 
smoke,” in a kind of awed whisper. 

I was just as awed. I said, “That 
looks to me like'. 



THE SCARED STARSHIP 



69 




He nodded. “It looks to me like, 
too. Let’s get back to a projector.” 

Dave checked in by radio as we 
were going bade to barge, and 
they had a projector set up. Captain 
Scott, one of the few guys we knew 
to whom we could say “Sir!” and 
really mean it, was waiting patient- 
ly, his burned, gray-templed face 
looking exactly his forty years. I 
imagine Admiral Scott will still look 
forty, and patient, when he retires. 
Hai^ Owen, a little bored looking be- 
cause this was something out of his 
line, scowled as always at the screen. 
Margot set my head spinning when 
she touched me on the cheek helping 
me out of my helmet, but I got my 
eyes focused again and sat down. 

The captain said, “Let’s see it, 
Dave,” and Dave tapped the switch. 
We saw the black, rocky outcrop- 




ping, with rusty sand drifting down 
away from it. Mars landscape. 
You’ve seen thousands of feet of it. 
But centered in this picture, slowly 
emerging as the sand spilled away 
from it, was the lower half, the legs, 
of a pressure suit, of what appear- 
ed to be metal, with ring joints at 
the knees. The upper half was still 
covered; but one leg was bent slight- 
ly, and we could see one gauntlet 
pressed flat, six fingers spread, as if 
whoever was inside had been trying 
to sit up. The metal gleamed inertly 
in the cold sunlight, and the six- 
fingered figure looked alien as . 
as . hell, nobody had ever seen 
an alien. 

Then I remembered. I moved to 
the control panel and punched for a 
rerun of instrument readings, hop- 
ing. I punched repeat, still hoping. 
But there had been no beam failure 
at the barge. I felt a little cold as 
I told the captain how something, 
possibly the Sino-Sov since it was the 
kind of thing Mao Lee was capable 
of, had cut my power beam, once 
for thirty seconds and again for 
about sixty. He checked the board. 
I guess I was avoiding the other 
possibility, but he didn’t. He said, 
“Mao isn’t above arranging an ac- 
cident for a couple of Imperialists 
if he gets the chance. But it could 
have been something inside that 
fumarole. We’ll have to watch it.” 

Margot asked, “Are we going to 
. .” And the captain grinned at her. 
“We sure are. But we aren’t going 
to broadcast any more power. We’ll 
move the barge over there.” 

The sleds can be towed — an- 
chored, one on a side, to the barge,

IF 



inside the field. We settled well to 
one side of the fumarole, suited up 
and slogged through the sand to 
where we could see. Our alien was 
sitting there. I remarked about it, 
and Dave asked pointedly if I had 
really expected him to move, saying 
that made me one stupid remark up 
on him. Margot shushed us. Captain 
Scott looked up at the half-blocked 
cavern mouth and then down the 
slope. “Hank,” he asked, “can you 
use those shaped charges of yours in 
loose sand?” 

Hank nodded. “Anywhere, Cap- 
tain. Firecracker size and up.” 

“If you can clear away a couple 
of tons of sand at the bottom, I 
think this stuff will flow again.” 
Hank nodded and turned back to 
the barge. 

I’ll say this for old Hank. He’s 
small and wiry and homely, with 
bleached yellow hair and a grumpy 
disposition. But I think his grumpy 
manner is mostly preoccupation. He 
has guts. In some ways its tougher 
to move into a possible danger zone 
than into one you know is loaded. 
All we knew then was that probably 
something inside that cave had 
tapped our power beam. But Hank 
didn’t bat an eye. He came back 
with a mean-looking little blob of 
putty, pushing a little transistorized 
detonator into it. The art, he says, 
is in shaping the goo and judging 
the setting of the detonator. It will 
go “phut” or “bang”. Hank is an 
artist with it And he moved out, 
sensibly keeping his head down, but 
without missing a step. 

He took his time, sizing up the 
drift. When he came hack he pushed 




a button on another gadget he took 
from his belt. This was a “phut” 
setting, and when he raised his thumb 
a cloud of red sand splashed out 
into the desert. Up above, the sand 
started flowing again. 

W e watched, fascinated, as the 
half-hitting, half-reclining fig- 
ure emerged. 

It was a pressure suit, but nothing 
like ours and nothing like those used 
by the Volga Boatmen. And it look- 
ed disturbingly as if whoever was in- 
side had just stopped to rest, too 
beat to make it back inside. It look- 
ed so alien, it gave me a chill, but 
it was not ugly. It was just, by our 
standards, misshapen. It was not tall, 
less than two meters, but the body 
was big. These people, I thought, 
must have come from a thin air

planet and needed plenty of lung 
space. The helmet was outsize, too, 
as if to accommodate a plume or 
crest. When the sand stopped flowing 
the whole thing was revealed, as was 
half the cavern mouth. 

Captain Scott said, “Get pictures 
of him, Dave, before we move him.” 
Dave shot as we approached and 
took close-ups after we got to him. 
We stayed back out of his way. We 
were still below the level of the 
sand piled in the cavern mouth, so 
long as we kept our heads down. 
Dave, kneeling beside the helmet, 
pointed and looked up. “How do you 
suppose he could see, through that?” 

The face plate was smooth and 
shining, but it was not transparent. 
We could see our reflections in the 
curved surface. Margot said, ‘Try 
infrared, Dave. Maybe these people 
see by heat waves or some other low 
band.” 

Dave nodded and shot some more 
footage at a wide spread of settings. 
Hien he turned his infrared setup 
on the cavern mouth. From outside, 
the cave entrance looked black as 
space; but there’s always a little heat, 
for a good photographer. 

When Dave finished the captain 
looked down, and he sounded al- 
most as if he were talking to him- 
self. “Not an anthropologist within 
a hundred and fifty million miles. 
Who would have thought we’d need 
one?” Then he spoke to me. “Rain- 
bow, we’ll have to take him back 
to the barge. We can’t work on him 
out here. See how heavy he is.” 

None of us had been under two 
fifths gravity long enough to go 
soft Besides, we keep the sleds, and 



the barge, at a full one G. 1 knelt be- 
side him, raised the straight leg so 
I could get my arm under it. He 
moved easily. I put the other arm 
under his shoulders and stood up- 
right. Then I glanced around and 
found my head was above the level 
of the sand in the cavern mouth. 
Something told me to duck out of 
there, and just as I did all hell broke 
loose. 

n 

S omething roared. Or gave the im- 
pression of a roar. 

You don’t hear much in that ten- 
uous nitrogen. But I could sure hear, 
or feel, this. And it wasn’t a jet 
blasting. It was force — big force. 
The tons sand which had filled 
the cavern mouth disappeared, flick- 
ed away, leaving the floor bare and 
glistening. And out of the corner of 
my eye I caught a glimpse, out in 
the desert, of a dust cloud forming 
as something brushed the surface, 
sending sand, and rocks as big as the 
barge, tumbling and disintegrating. 

Then the direction of the blast 
changed, turning away from me, 
swinging in a short arc and sending 
more sand flying. There was a faint 
puff of dust, and the cavern mouth 
was half again larger. The blast had 
touched the far side. For once my 
reflexes seemed to have failed me. 
But the whole thing lasted only sec- 
onds. Then it stopped as abruptly 
as it had started, and I found the 
captain tugging my arm, urging me 
away. I was scared, but I seemed all 
right, and I still held the alien. I 
started for the barge, with the others 
trooping along beside me. We took

where we could get some lights on 

kim, 

1 reached for my helmet release, 
but the captain tapped my aim 
“Leave it on,” he ordered. “We’ll 
stay suited up until we’ve looked thie 
fellow over. Hank? You’re the near- 
est we have to a bacteriologist Do 
what you can, and we’ll help.” Hank 
nodded and turned away. The cap- 
tain looked down thoughtfully and 
mused, “There’ll be some kind of or- 
ganic matter inside, if only dust.” 

We projected Dave’s closeups of 
the faceplate. But he had picked up 
only shadows. We couldn’t tell what 
was inside. So there was a tense mo- 
ment when we lifted off the plate. 
We were prepared to find something 
fascinating, or horrible, or both. But 
the captain had been right on both 
counts. There was organic matter, 
but it was little more than dust — 
some fragments of bone and some 
slightly canine-looking teeth. Hank 
carefully tweezered them up and put 
them on a tray. I felt a touch of 
anxious guilt, as if we were violating 
a tomb. Then we got to work. 

We had to improvise. We used 
Hank’s equipment and his micro- 
scope. Our little computer whirred 
and muttered over the data Hank 
and Margot fed into it. But finally 
Hank, still scowling, nodded to the 
captain; and we gratefully got out 
of our helmets and gloves. Hank 
looked down at the pitiful remnants 
of the alien and said, “He can’t hurt 
us. “He’s no more dangerous, now, 
than the Egyptian kings they have 
on display at Cairo.” 



“Do you mean he’s that old, too?” 
Hank made what was for him la 
joke. “Not quite. When he sat dowm 
out there, the big news m Europe 
was Caesar’s assassiDation.” 

We looked at each other, aai 
Margot whistled softly. “You mean 
he was out there on that ledge lor 
two thousand years?” 

“Give or take a half century.” 

We didn’t question Hank. He is 
eompctent, and this had not beea se 
far out of his line at that. We had 
been dealing more with a fossil than 
a biological specimen. We packed 
the alien away, and nobody wd 
anything, just yet, of what I was 
wondering about. What, inside that 
cavern, was still capable of blasting 
what could only have been some 
kind of ship drive at ue? 

T hat it was a ship drive was con- 
firmed immediately. 

Dave’s angled, infrared shots look- 
ed a little eerie, as infrared always 
does. But what we saw on the screen 
was the stern of a boat. It looked as 
alien as the suit. The stern was flat, 
chopped off, with almost no projec- 
tions and certainly with no rocket 
tube such as we use. It appeared 
about four meters high. On the flat, 
stern surface there was a target- 
shaped group of rings, with the cen- 
ter ring higher than the Test. Spaced 
around the outer circle were four 
miniatures of the same design, 
mounted on short, ball-and-socket 
joints. Steering units? 

They were. Dave’s reflexes hadn’t 
failed him. He had caught most of 
the blast, including the turn when 
the drive swept in its short arc away 



THE SCARED STARSHIP 



73 




from us. We could see the steering 
units turn toward us and the whole 
ship turn and edge forward into the 
cavern, coming to a shuddering stop. 
It had been when the ship yawed 
that the drive bad touched the far 
edge of the cavern mouth. The 
frames after cutoff showed the ob- 
sidian gouged out, smooth as a mir- 
ror. 

Dave snapped on the lights. “Good 
thing you kept your head down. 
Rainbow.” 

The captain looked around and 
said thoughtfully, “This is going to 
take some of the smugness out of us. 
By that boat’s size and the* size of 
that suit. I’d guess the boat is a life- 
boat. The fact that they lost a ship 
and had to take to the boats shows 
they weren’t infallible. But they were 
a long way ahead of us, and that was 
two thousand years ago, when this 
fellow died.” 

Hank gestured toward the screen. 
“Seems there’s someone or some- 
thing alive in there now.” 

“Something, not someone. The 
boat is automated, robotic, with sen- 
sors that found our beam and tapped 
it — quite an accomplishment in it- 
self — and also sensed us outside the 
cavern. I believe now it was the 
boat, not our friend Mao, although 
that would have been a joke on Mao. 
It led us to something he would 
trade his ancestors’ bones for. But 
there can’t be anything in there alive, 
in the sense that we are alive.” 

Margot frowned and said, “Some 
computers . .” But the captain 
shook his head. “We’ve got compu- 
ters that seem to think. But we still 
have to tell them what to do. They 



just do it faster. No, I think we’ve 
just found a highly automated life- 
boat, with some Idnd of protective 
reactions programmed into it. And 
we must have it — intact. If we’re 
sharp enough to figure how it works, 
we may take a two-thousand-year 
technological jump in a few years. 
A starship!” 

Then he turned to Hank. “We 
keep dropping the work in your lap. 
Hank. There’s a real valuable miner- 
al deposit under that ridge. Let’s 
find out what it looks like and what 
it’s made of. Maybe we can figure 
a way to get in there, past that drive 
and the steering units.” 

I t was hard work, even in two- 
fifths gravity, getting Hank set 
up. But we did, finally, to his scow- 
ling satisfaction. He started setting 
off a series of his little “phut” 
charges, and his recorders ticked and 
whirred as the echoes bounced back. 
He has some pretty sophisticated 
gadgets, and he kept them busy until 
dark. That night he and Margot drew 
us a diagram. 

“The hull is the same material our 
friend here was wearing. I’m not sure 
it is metal. A diamond drill won’t 
touch the suit, although a laser will. 
But inside the hull there is copper, 
iron, silver, plastics, the whole bit. 
Their gadgetry is made up of much 
the same materials we use. And, oh, 
there are two more aliens in there, 
just as dead as this one. The hull is 
six meters high at center, tapering to 
about four at each end. It’s thirty 
meters long. And it’s wedged, now, 
into a curve in that obsidian blow 
hole.”

Hien Hank cleared his throat, and 
his scowl faded to only a couple of 
fines across his forehead. For him 
that was the equivalent of a beaming 
smile. **How about blasting out this 
side of the cavern mouth? We might 
widen it enough so we can go in 
from an angle, out of range.” 

We looked at the sketch, and the 
captain said, “It might work, Hank. 
We don’t know how far those steer- 
ing units can swivel, but it’s worth 
trying.” 

But wc didn’t get the chance. Next 
morning, as the captain was talking 
to our dome and asking that tools, 
and our computer man, be sledded 
out to us, the unmistakable frying 
static of an approaching antigrav 
unit, a big one, crackled from the 
speaker. We looked out to sec an- 
other barge, a smaller one than ours, 
with Sino-Sov markings, settle be- 
tween us and the cave. In a moment 
we heard Mao Lee’s clipped Oxford 
accent wishing us a pleasant good 
morning. 

Wc had met him, on Earth, and 
also Colonel Rostoff. The colonel 
was a spacer. Make no mistake, he 
would liquidate you without blink- 
ing. But only when and if he were 
ordered to. Mao was a different 
breed of Sinner. He was a hatchet 
man and an ambitious one. Stories 
filtered through to us. There always 
seemed to be vacancies in the ranks 
just above him. 

He came in through the lock, 
and he was wearing a sidearm. The 
captain answered his greeting curtly 
and pointed to the luger. “A formal 
protest. Captain. The preliminary 
surveys indicated arms would not be 



needed here, and it was agreed, wlien 
our expeditions were being readied, 
that none would be brought.” 

Mao’s swarthy face grimaced in a 
wolfish smile, reducing his cyec to 
slits. “So, Captain? I wasn’t aware 
the agreement applied to sidearma.” 
Captain Scott looked steadily at 
him. “What arc you doing w this 
sector?” 

Mao shrugged and grinned bland- 
ly. “Why, this is open area.” 

“It is not. It is fifty kilometera in- 
side the district allotted to us by 
the Delhi agreement. Our surveys, 
made this trip, will confirm it.” 
Mao shrugged. “That remains to 
be seen. Captain. Until it has been 
proven, I shall treat this as open 
ground. And in open ground we 
share any discoveries.” 

Ti Tar got had one of Hank’s lam- 
tVJL pics in her fist. Dave and I 
were trying to edge around behind 
Mao. But the captain shook his head. 
He went on, to Mao, “We don’t yet 
know what we have here. But what- 
ever it is we intend to keep it. If 
it is to be shared with your people 
the decision will be made at Delhi.” 
Then Mao again favored us with 
his wolf grin and slid the luger into 
his palm. “No, Captain. The decision 
will be made here and now.” He 
flicked the gun at us and then moved 
catlike to the worktable. His eyes 
went over the alien suit. “Ah! We 
suspected as much, from what we 
heard of your intercom conversa- 
tion.” Then he bowed slightly to 
Margot and pointed with the gun to 
the sketches. “Ah, Miss Harris. Put 
down that, ah, paperweight, please.

and show me what you have learn- 
ed so far.” 

Margot’s face paled, and her quick 
intake of breath sounded a storm 
warning; but the captain shook his 
head. “Do what he asks, Margot. We 
don’t want anyone killed here just 
yet.” 

Mao hissed, “Sensible, Captain,” 
and his eyes glittered as he went 
over the sketch. He was not inter- 
ested in the alien as such. But his 
conclusion was the same as ours, 
that the alien had come from some- 
where beyond our system. Presently 
his eyes slitted again, and he gestured 
with the luger. “A starship, possibly? 
We will inspect this cavern. Cap- 
tain. Suits, all of you.” 

We took our time. Hank seemed 
to be having a lot of trouble with 
his equipment, and non-hero Dave 
was stopped once two short steps 
from Mao. Mao’s wolfish grin flash- 
ed as his fingers tightened on the 
luger. The captain snapped, “No, 
Dave. If he has a hand gun his men 
will have tommy guns at least.” 
Mao hissed, “Senwble, Captain. 
And correct.” 

m 

W e could see two suited figures 
in Mao’s barge. 

There was no room for any more 
to be hidden in the space not covered 
by the plastic covered control area. 
His was not a work vehicle. But 
there was a man outside our lock. 
He wore an imitation of Mao’s slit- 
eyed grin on his face and had a ma- 
chine pistol in his hands. He covered 
us while we walked to the cavern. 



Mao inspected the entrance, from 
the side, and then motioned his man 
in with a floodlight 

The captain said, “You don’t de- 
serve this, Mao, but a light, or move- 
ment in the cavern mouth, may trig- 
ger a blast from that drive.” 

Mao laughed. “And you would 
not like to see me killed. I can al- 
ways count on this behavior pattern 
from you. Captain. It is one of the 
things that makes life simpler for 
me. But the drive is headed away 
from us. We saw the dust cloud yes- 
terday and the marking on the 
desert this morning.” 

I knew things were getting tense. 
The captain had edged closer to Mao 
while he was talking, and I had 
seen Hank fish something from his 
belt pouch. I looked closely, and 
damned if he didn’t have one of his 
little blobs of putty in his fist. We 
hadn’t had time to make any cam- 
paign plans, but I had the feeling 
the captain would try something if 
the drive blasted and diverted Mao. 
Mao’s man flicked on the light and 
edged forward. I suppressed a yell 
of glee, when I saw he was moving 
into the edge of the cavern opening. 
He was clear of the drive, but our 
last photos had shown the steering 
units still aimed toward us. The 
light picked out the far side of the 
drive, and he leaned forward for a 
better look. Then he stopped, and I 
guessed he had noticed the steering 
units staring him in the face. But 
he was too late. As he started to 
back away the drive cut in with a 
roar, and the blast from the lower 
steering unit caught him at the knees.

gushed out of his suit. It’s a messy 
way to die, but it’s quick. One down! 
I dove for Mao’s gun hand just as 
the captain did. 1 saw Dave and 
Hank lunge in from the side. Hank 
got to him, and Mao went down 
momentarily. But he was lithe as a 
cat and rolled to his feet. 1 saw the 
luger flash twice and I felt a bee 
sting my upper arm. Suit pressure 
dropped and then built up again as 
the punctures sealed. Mao crouched, 
the luger slowly swinging from side 
to side. And the captain was down. 

I got up, breathing hard. Margot 
was on her knees beside the captain, 
and I saw his suit had sealed, too. 
And the puncture in front was high 
in the shoulder. I was hopeful. Mar- 
got crackled something unladylike at 
Mao, who laughed. “Stupid. All of 
you. If your captain is dead it is be- 
cause he asked for it. Don’t anyone 
else ask for the same thing. I’ll have 
no compunction . .” 

Then Hank interrupted him. “I’ll 
have no compunction either, Mao. 
Look! you know what this is. Your 
people use the same thing!” Hank 
was holding his little detonator in 
his fist, his thumb pressed on the 
firing pin. “When my thumb re- 
leases this, whether I’m dead or not, 
that charge stuck to your back be- 
tween your air tanks will blow. Now 
toss that luger into the sand over 
there!” 

Mao’s voice hissed back quickly. 
“If I go, you all go with me! Have 
you thought of that?” 

And for the first time since I had 
known him I heard Hank laugh. “I 
sure have thought of that, Mao. 
There’s just enough force there be- 



tween your shoulders to take the 
back out of your suit. You like to 
gamble — I’ll stand within a meter 
of you and wave my thumb!” 

Mao seemed to shrink. He glanced 
at his barge, glared at us; and a 
mumbled stream of what must have 
been Canton gutter profanity came 
through our phones. But he tossed 
the luger aside and stood frozen. 

Hank said, “Margot, you and 
Dave take the captain back and get 
at that wound. Looks high in the 
shoulder, but he’ll be bleeding. I’ll 
take care of this.” 

I scrambled to help them, and 
while we were getting the captain 
up, so they could carry him, Margot 
was able to ask, “How, Hank? You’re 
not going to just ...” And again 
Hank laughed. It was getting to be a 
habit. “No, not in cold blood. I’ll 
tell you later. Git! And Rainbow, I 
want to strip the weapons out of 
that barge of his.” 

I had been wondering how we were 
going to get loose of this tiger’s 
tail, short of a shooting between the 
eyes, which I would have been very 
happy to do. 

But Hank said no, we already had 
an international, interspace incident 
on our hands. We didn’t want to 
complicate it. Mao’s men had swarm- 
ed out of the barge, but on Mao’s 
snarled command were behaving 
themselves. Soon Hank was standing 
by a pile of weapons, with the crew, 
hating us with their eyes, frozen 
rigid. I went through the barge, tak- 
ing my time and not being too care- 
ful about what I smashed while pok- 
ing into corners. I came out with 

IF 



78 




one more machine pistol which I hap- 
pily kept pointing at Mao’s belly. 

Tlien Hank laughed again, told me 
to cover them and see if I could 
dream up some excuse to shoot all 
three and not to be too fussy. Then 
he climbed one handed to the top 
of the barge. He came back in a 
moment, a wolfish grin worthy of 
of Mao on his thin face. He said, 
“Mao, as soon as you are away you 
will, of course, have the boys re- 
move that charge from your back 
and toss it out the lock. But as soon 
as I raise my thumb, the charge on 
top of your dome will blow the barge 
to bits. Fm going up on top of that 
bluff back there, with glasses, and 
I better not see that barge go to 
ground or see anyone climbing 
around on it. It will be up to you to 
figure out how far I will be able to 
see you. When you’re out of sight 
you will have thirty seconds to 
ground and get away from the barge 
before I blow it. If your timing is 
wrong, you will go with the barge. 
If it is right, you will have the 
privilege of walking from there 
home. I hope you guess wrong. 
Now, git!” 

If the captain hadn’t been hit and 
maybe dying back in our own barge, 
I would have howled with glee. And 
I did manage an “Amen” when I 
heard Margot’s voice in the radio 
call, “Hank! I love you!” Then it 
dawned on me the captain must be 
all right or she wouldn’t have been 
listening. I did yell, then, until I 
heard the captain’s voice, weak but 
steady, tell me to get back home, 
there was work to do. I left Hank 
up on the hogback with my glasses. 



his fist held high in case Mao had 
glasses on him, watching the barge 
cut at speed for the horizon. 

The captain was sitting up when I 
came in. He was pale, but the slug 
had caught him high in the shoulder 
and had not broken any bones. He 
grinned at me. “I’ll compliment all 
of you later. I’m proud of you. But 
we’re working against time now. 
Rostoff will be back.” Then he pick- 
ed up the microphone. “Hank,” he 
called, “keep your range low. You 
didn’t blow that barge did you?” 
Hank’s voice had a faint chuckle 
in it. I guess he just hadn’t been 
getting enough action. Laughing was 
getting to be a habit. “Naw, Captain. 
But Mao knows I’m no gentleman, 
so he’ll be doubtful. I figure the loss 
of face will hurt him more than any- 
thing else, ril come in now.” 

T he captain turned back to us. 

“We’re armed now, something 
Rostoff and Mao can understand. 
We’ll be better armed when our 
people get here from the dome. We’re 
not entirely without sin ourselves. 
But I want to be in full possession 
of that boat before Rostoff gets back 
here. So start thinking. How do we 
get in there quickly?” 

Hank came in, actually grinning. 
The captain waved him an across- 
the-face salute. “You have hidden 
talents. Hank. Thanks. Tell me, how 
long would it take to tunnel into 
that port from the side?” 

“Days, at best. We can still try 
widening the cavern mouth. But if 
the steering units will swivel forty 
five degrees, they can still track us 
and block us.”

The captain nodded. a gam- 
ble. How long would tibat take?” 

Margot interrupted before Hank 
could give an estimate, *Wait a min- 
»te. Captain. I wasn’t as busy as the 
rest of you during that mix-up. I 
noticed something. We’ve been as- 
suming a defensive reaction from 
that boat.” 

“Yes. And pretty successfid. k has 
killed one man.” 

“But I don’t believe it was trying 
to kill him. The steering units didn’t 
move. They didn’t track him. He 
just got in the way. I think that what- 
ever is activating that drive is, well, 
alive — aware — and is simply try- 
ing to crowd that boat farther into 
the cavern. In short, it is alive and 
scared ” 

We all looked kind of blank, and 
Dave grinned. “That puts you one 
stupid remark up on Rainbow and 
me.” 

“That’s your game,” she snapped. 
“Leave me out of it. Listen. There’s 
a computer of some kind in there. 
But the drive is two thousand years 
ahead of ours so the computer is, 
too.” 

The captain looked interested. 
“Reasonable. Go on, Margot.” 

“I believe that computer is aware, 
that it can really think. But it has 
just — well — awakened, after being 
inoperative for two thousand years, 
possibly with part or most of its 
memory inoperative from disintegra- 
tion or lack of power. I think all the 
power it has is what it trapped from 
our beam in ninety seconds. It’s 
“alive,” regressed, and it is just simp- 
ly scared and trying to hide.” 

1 couldn’t quite grasp it It made 

W 



sense, of a sort, and then it didn’t. 
In spite of myself 1 grinned at her 
and the others, even the captain, 
looked puzzled and a little amused. 
Margot waited, watching us, and 
then her face paled a little so the 
freckles sparkled. Oh! Oh! Storm 
signal! Her voice dropped to a whis- 
per, a sure sign she was hopping 
mad. 

“You! Listen to me. I like being 
a woman. I like being a good-looking 
woman, and I know I am because I 
can see it in Rainbow’s eyes and 
Dave’s and Hank’s and everybody’s 
except . .” She was glaring at the 
captain, and she stumbled over the 
word “except.” And for once he had 
lost his calm, patient look and was 
just staring. But her voice tumbled 
on, and she shocked me just a little 
for I had never heard her swear like 
a man before. She even banged 
her fist on the table. 

“But Goddamnit!” she hissed. 
“Like any other woman there are 
times when I want to be treated like 
a man, and this is one of the times!” 

We didn’t say a word. She put her 
elbows on the table and ticked off 
her points. “The boat obviously has 
sensors. But the alien saw by infra- 
red, so the sensors do, too. That 
may be why the boat was put in the 
cavern in the first place — to get in 
out of the glare. The alien came 
from a thin-air planet — that huge 
chest capacity — so he would be 
especially sensitive to sound waves. 
And so are the boat’s sensors. And 
there’s no reason to believe the 
steering units are tracking us. They’ve 
moved only in a turning maneuver. 
/ think the boat can’t even see us, 



outside. It can hear us, is afraid of 
us and is trying only to get away 
from us.” 

The captain nodded. “All right, 
Margot. Go on.” 

Her voice was back to nornial. 
She glanced around at us and said, 
a little anxiously, “I’m sorry I blew 
my top.” The captain waved it away, 
and she went on. “I think there’s a 
way to get inside that cavern inside 
the next two hours, with no danger 
at all. If we do it right and are abso- 
lutely silent about it.” 

W e were all interested now. The 
captain said, “OK. Let’s take 
one point at a time. Why silent?” 
“Because of the boat’s fear reac- 
tion. I insist it is “aware,” but just 
barely. A human baby may laugh 
and wave its fists at the pretty, pretty' 
flames when the far side of the roon 
catches fire. But it will scream ir 
terror when it hears the fire siren 
coming. So far, we’ve been anything 
but quiet. So we’ll be absolutely si- 
lent until we are in past the drive 
and steering units. Once inside, 
where the sensors can really see me, 
I think it won’t fire. It won’t be 
afraid. It may even open the port to 
me.” 

We stirred a little, but the captain 
gestured us to silence. “Go on, Mar- 
got. How and why? How can you get 
in with absolute silence. And why 
will it open to you. Not to us, by 
your statement, but to youV 

She glanced over at me and then 
she dropped her bomb as casually 
as if she were asking for more coffee. 
“Because,” she said carefully, “Rain- 
bow will fly me in, on antigrav, on a 



THE SCARED STARSHIP 



81 




stripped sled. And because I’m the 
only one small enough to get into the 
alien’s pressure suit.” 

I yelled, “Yipe!,” and everyone 
start^ talking at once. The captain 
quelled the babble with a raised 
hand. “Hold it! Let’s work it out! 
You must know, Margot, that we 
can’t broadcast any more power 
toward that boat, even a minimum 
beam to a stripped sled. I won’t feed 
that boat any more power.” 

She nodded. “But we can strip a 
sled, even of instruments and the 
landing runners and pushpots. And 
we can clamp on, and wire into the 
grav unit, every power pack we have 
with us. I know that won’t give 
power enough to lift the sled more 
than a meter, or let Rainbow move it 
more than a few meters at most, on 
the level. But if we take it up above 
the cavern, on that bluff, before we 
remove the pushpots, he will have 
•power enou^ to control a glide 
down. He can swing into the cavern 
mouth, in between those two steer- 
ing-unit paths. You can see their 
marks on this side of the cavern 
mouth. But Captain, they won’t 
fire! And even if they do, they 
won’t attempt to track us. And I 
know Rainbow can take me in!” 
The smile she dimpled at me 
would ordinarily have melted me 
down to head-tobbing incoherence. 
But I was visualizing that bluff and 
the cavern entrance. Why, after the 
first few seconds I wouldn’t have 
any lift at all with that kind of 
power. This wouldn’t be a docking 
maneuver. It would be more like 
riding a square-ended redwood plank 
down a ten-foot wave between the 



pilings of a pier. And with a pas- 
senger! 

I was about to say so when the 
captain* looking around the cabin at 
the various power packs available, 
undercut me. He said, “I know he 
could take you in, Margot. I’ve dock- 
ed with him. I’m not concerned 
about that part. But the suit isn’t tight 
any more. And why should you wear 
it, anyway?” 

“It doesn’t have to be tight. I can 
get into it with my own suit on. I 
won’t want the gauntlets or boots 
anyway. The arms and legs would 
be too long. And I need it so the 
boat’s sensors will see something 
familiar, one of its own people, 
coming to it. And it will let me in. 
I’m sure of it!” 

S he waited, her eyes shining, and 
the captain’s fingers drummed the 
table, a thing I had never seen be- 
fore. He kept looking at her as if 
he had never seen her before. And 
he was thinking the same thing I 
was, for presently he said that the 
steering units would blast the min- 
ute we put anything in sight in the 
cave mouth. She shook her head. 
“The sensors can’t see anything out- 
side in that glare. It’s sound that 
triggers them.” 

I didn’t envy the captain. I’m as 
ambitious as the next rocket jockey 
and given at times to pleasant little 
fantasies in which I appear as Fear- 
less Leader. But I was sure glad that 
decision was up to him, not me. But 
he imposed only one condition; that 
we take along one of Hank’s little 
laser drills, so we could cut our way 
into the boat if we had to. He ended 



82 



IF 




up grinning at her and saying, “Okay, 
Tiger. As of now, you’re just one of 
the boys!” 

And wouldn’t you know it? She 
promptly turned girl again. She 
sparkled, her amber eyes glowing, 
and for a minute I thought she was 
going to kiss him. I felt a little pang, 
for I knew it was only a matter of 
time before she did. And then I did 
envy him. 

IV 

B ut we got to work. Or, rather, 
Dave and Hank did. 

Margot and I put on red goggles 
and kept out of the li^t as much as 
we could. When we suited up we had 
attached hinged, red sunscreens over 
our helmet faces. We had to be able 
to see, a little at least, in that dim 
light inside. Even though the alien 
face plate had been removed, I got 
a slight case of the shudders when I 
saw the suit walking toward me. It 
seemed to me it would be a little 
like getting into a mummy case, even 
though she did have her own suit 
on. 

They stripped a sled and wired in 
the power packs and got it into po- 
sition on the bluff before they re- 
nooved the pushpots and runners. I 
climbed up and strapped down to the 
bare deck and had another case of 
the shudders. I had a stick and a 
voltmeter and my eyes to fly by. 
But we were as ready as we would 
ever be. Margot stepped up beside 
me and slapped me on the helmet. 
“Scared, Rainbow?” 

“Tiger, that puts you one stupid 
remark up on me. Aren’t you?” 



She laughed. “That question 
makes us even. You’re piloting this 
surfboard, remember? It’s a log, but 
this will be no worse than riding a 
big one in to the beach at Makaha. 
You do that every trip home, just 
for kicks. Let’s go, surfer.” 

She grabbed me by the shoulder, 
and I lifted the sled from the jacks 
and used a lot of our power just for 
that first shove. I us^ a lot more 
swinging wide, for I wanted to avoid 
a drop-turn and get a straight shot 
at the slot I had visualized between 
those two steering unit paths. She 
insisted on standing up because, she 
said, she wanted the boat’s sensors 
to recognize her at its first glimpse 
when he came in out of the glare. 
It made sense, but my clearance was 
only centimeters, top and bottom. 
It was a case of do it right the first 
time or take a chance on getting 
Margot’s helmet sliced off. 

But it was something I could do, 
if I didn’t tense up. So I sat loose, 
let my belly muscles sag and flew 
it by eye and by the seat of my 
pants. And it was close. After the 
turn those two grooves looked aw- 
fully close together. But it was right, 
and we rode in through the slot as 
if we were on rails. And she had 
called it right! There wasn’t a flick- 
er from drive or steering units. 

I pushed Up the red sunscreen as 
soon as we left sunlight and sure 
bnough I could see, a little. Ob- 
viously she could, to, for she 
stepped off, walked briskly to the 
port and just stood there. And again 
she had called the turn. Damned 
if there wasn’t a growing whisper 
of static in my radio. It couldn’t 



THE SCARED STARSHIP 



83 




have come from the sled for we had 
touched down on our last pulse of 
power. But there was the crackle of 
relays clicking and solenoids snap- 
ping and servo motors starting. In a 
few more seconds the port dilated, 
and the faintest of red lights came 
on inside the lock. Margot waved 
to me and walked up the steps as if 
she were going home. 

I wanted to yell. I wanted to fol- 
low her in. But I sat still, as agreed, 
trying to look like another piece of 
machinery. But the rest of it was 
almost routine. She and the captain 
quietly talked over the circuitry. I 
heard her gasp when she reported 
two more empty suits. She said she 
wasn’t even going to look in the 
bunks. And as they worked it out 
they didn’t even have to cut any 
leads. The aliens were a long way 



ahead of us, but control circuits — 
well, there’s only one sensible way 
to build some things. She found the 
drive switches and cut them out. 
Then they moved the barge close, 
and Dave and Hank came in with 
floodlights. We got busy tracing 
down the computer, the black box, 
which Margot insisted was ahve, 
aware, but had regressed to the 
point where it was in effect a child 
— and a scared child at that. But 
inside it, we believed, was our star- 
ship. 

And child or not, it is now her 
baby. She and I have already taught 
it to talk. She said she wanted my 
voice graph for the voder. She brib- 
ed, fought and charmed her way 
into lead spot on the team that is 
trying to reconstruct Baby and cut 
in the damaged memory banks, plus

some units of our own. And we 
**Martian8” are making real pro- 
gress now. Rostoff 8 people are yell- 
ing, but the senators are not grump- 
ing now. They’re pushing up any- 
thing we ask for, and damn the cost. 

M ost people are a little edgy 
about what kind of people the 
aliens — Kalsa, Baby calls them — 
may turn out to be. But 1 thhik 
they’ll turn out pretty much as we 
arc. After ail, they built Baby; and 
if you build a thinking machine it 
will think like you do. And just now, 
when I started to leave the lab. 
Baby hissed at me. 

It was a little di: . ^neerting to hear 
my own voice calling me, but I 



walked over lo the voder. Baby whis- 
pered, **Rainbow, Margot and the 
eaptain are — what is it yon eay — 
•Mke that,’ aren’t they?” 

I sighed. “Afraid so.” 

“Well, that assistant they sent wp 
from the heavy planet last week. Not 
the machine. The light-crested fe- 
male human. Dave says he has her 
number, but 1 think that puts him 
one stupid remark up on you. She’s 
been watching yon. What are you, 
anyway, a Kalsa or a Qwertyuiop? 
Get with it!” 

Sec what I mean? We’ll get along 
with them, when we find them. But 
you’ll have to excuse me. I have a 
phone call to make.

IF • Short Story 



BY THE SEAWALL 

by ROBERT SILVERBERG 



tAicah-lV wasn't human and couldn't 
understand why humans did strange 
things — but he could imitate them! 



I t was Michas-IV’s bad luck to be 
on duty by the seawall the day 
the first of the suicides occurred. 
He was not really to blame for 
what happened, but he was repri- 
manded none the less. How could 
he have known? How could he be- 
gin to comprehend human motives? 

His post along the seawall was 
exactly a thousand meters long. It 
was Zone KF-6 on the master 
chart, shown as a neat, elongated 
blue block. Since the total length 
of the seawall was six thousand 
kilometers, Micah-IV knew that he 
was responsible for precisely one 
six-thousandth of the entire length 
of the seawall. It was a somber 
burden, for did not the safety of 
humanity depend on the wall? Yes. 
But Micah-IV was watchful. He 



patrolled his kilometer twelve hours 
a day, ever vigilant. He did his 
best; but he was not omniscient. 

The seawall stood sixty meters 
high throughout most of its length 
and was twenty meters thick at its 
base, tapering to a width of six 
meters at the top. It was constructed 
of blocks of gray-green stone, dress- 
ed and trued to the last millimeter 
and laid one atop another without 
need of mortar. The stone came from 
the Wyoming nuclear kilns, beetle- 
trucked across the continent to its 
place at the shore. Building the 
wall had taken the better part of 
two generations, even with mechan- 
ical help. It had been the great 
communal effort of mankind. Its 
vastness made a mockery of all ear- 
lier accomplishments of its sort. 



86 





The Great Pyramid was a heap 
of pebbles beside it, and China’s 
Great WaH, a rivulet of sand. 

Beyond the seawall lay the gray 
bulk of the ocean, beast infested, 
sinister. 

A s he marched parade from one 
end of Zone KF-6 to the other, 
Micah-IV could sometimes see the 
beasts turning and twisting in the 
water. Now and then one would 
swim curiously up toward the land, 
searching for a chink in the armor 
of humanity. There were no chinks, 
of course. The beasts were deflect- 
ed, a kilometer from shore, by a 
zone of poison, spewed day and 
night by vents sprouting from the 
seawall itself. If the beasts passed 
the yellow-stained poison zone, they 
next encountered a belt of electrifi- 
cation, fifty meters wide, ready to 
unleash thousands of kilowatts upon 
any lifeform large enough to trigger 
it. Within the electrified belt lay 
the seawall. Its outer face gleamed 
like annealed bronze and was as 
smooth as the finest glass. 

No beast could dimb that wall. 
No beast ever had, in the eighty 
years since the wall’s completion. 

Several had tried, though Micah- 
IV had not seen it happen. In 
2^ne CJ-9, some forty years ago, 
a scaly thing with fiery red eyes 
and a ferocious tail had propelled 
its way through the poison zone, 
had endured the electricity, and 
had launched itself against the wall 
in blind fury. Thirty tons of angry 
flesh struck the seawall without 
causing it to quiver. Bracing itself 
on mighty hind flippers, the monster 



rose erect, its snout twenty meters 
above the ground, its rough tongue 
lapping at the glassy stone, and it 
attempted to climb. 

There was no way for it to gain 
purchase. It slipped back again and 
again. At last it dropped to the 
rocky shore just without the sea- 
wall and lay there exhausted. Its 
ponderous gasps could be heard 
far away. Levering itself up once 
more, it butted its head mindlessly 
against the base of the wall for 
days, until in the end the gray- 
green stone was liberally stained 
with red, and the decaying, bloated 
corpse of the monster lay by the 
shore as prey for the scavenger 
birds. 

Twenty years later Zone BX-11 
had had a much closer call. A 
sinuous ebony thing longer than 
any tree was tall had made its 
journey safely past poison and 
electricity and, extending tendrils 
thirty meters long tipped with great 
sucker-pads, had begun to dimb. 
Up, up, up, until the stinking salty 
mass clung to the seawall’s middle, 
and then one of the sucker-pads 
slapped itself to the stone a scant 
five meters from the top. That ac- 
tivated the resonating circuits. 
Booming waves of sound raced 
along the spectrum from the bot- 
tom to a scope of several million 
hz. The sea boiled and churned. 
The sucker-pads relented; the crea- 
ture fell back and was dashed against 
the boulders at the base of the sea- 
wall. 

M icah-IV had known no such 
excitements. For half die 



BY THE SEAWALL

hours of each day he moved from 
southern border of KF-7 to the 
northern border of KF-5, watching 
the sea. Now a lemon-colored tor- 
pedo of an animal, scales bright 
in the sunlight, would flash by, well 
outside the poison zone. Now 
Micah-IV would see by night the 
uplifted luminous trawler-organ of a 
giant sweeper of the seas and by 
its light would glimpse the terrible, 
gaping mouth behind that dangling 

orb. Now he would see tentacles 

lash the water; now, the sudden 
spike of a ghastly fin. 

The beasts kept their distance. 

Once they had raided the shore 
settlements at will, for most of 
them could tolerate an hour or two 
in the air. Since the construction 
of the seawall they had been de- 
nied that pleasure. The dwellers of 
the land were safe from the night- 
mares in the sea. Walled off, 

thwarted, the great things circled 
and wheeled in their own salty ele- 
ment, now and again attacking each 
other in battles that made the con- 
tinents tremble. 

Twelve hours Micah-IV walked 
the battlements. Twelve hours he 
rested in the barracks of the guard- 
ians. Even synthetic flesh must have 
a chance to rid itself of the poisons 
of fatigue. 

His job was ^mple. He patrolled 
the upper walkway, keeping watch 
on the sea against an unwanted 
intruder from below. In the event 
one oi the beasts attempted an at- 
tack, he was required to notify the 
central authorities. His sphere of 
responsibility also embraced main- 
tenance of Ae wall; he was charged 



with discovering potential defects 
or strains before they became ser- 
ious, and with reporting them to 
the proper departments. 

Lastly, Micah-IV’s tasks included 
dealing with the humans who oc- 
casionally mounted the wall to look 
at the sea. 

They came, generally, in family 
groups of five or six. Micah-IV 
greeted them courteously, spoke of 
the techniques by which the sea- 
wall had been constructed, and 
when possible pointed out to them 
the sporting monsters off shore. If 
a child became fearful, Micah-IV 
comforted it. If a woman developed 
nausea, Micah-IV gave her medi- 
cine. If a man in his boldness went 
to close to the low retaining bar- 
rier that topped the wall, Micah-IV 
tactfully suggested that he stand 
back a bit. One never knew when 
a sucker-tipped tentacle would probe 
from below. 

I t was a dreary, mechanical job, 
which was why human beings 
did not care for it. Micah-IV, as 
a synthetic, was better able to cope 
with boredom. He had patrolled the 
seawall for more than a decade 
now, and the uneventful round of 
his days did not have serious effects 
on his mind. Every third year he 
needed a retuning to cancel the 
cumulative impact of the boredom, 
that was all.

Snow, Wind, Rain. Heat Sun. 

Tang of salt air in the cunningly 
crafted nostrils. 

Whitecaps on the surface of the 
sea. Vast tiusgs heayiag in its 
depths. 

Privately Micah-IV yearned for 
an incident. Let a beast try to 
scale the wall, he prayed. Let a 
woman tourist enter childbirth atop 
the wall. Let a stone block be struck 
by lightning and crumble. Some- 
tWng novel, something unexpected, 
something to give 2^>ne KF-6 its 
place in seawall history. 

He was within a year of need- 
ing another tuning. That was why 
he felt the wish for novelty. 

He stared hopefully at the things 
lashing the water, waiting for them 
to attack. But they did not attack. 
It would be futile, and the animals 
out there knew it. The wall was 
impenetrable. The days when ma- 
rauders out of the sea devoured 
hundreds of humans for lunch were 
over forever. 

It was curious, then, that when 
the first unusual incident in Micah- 
IV’s patrol career occurred, he was 
unable to prevent tragedy. 

He was nearly at the southern end 
of his assigned strip of the sea- 
wall when a faint pinging sound in- 
formed him that tourists had en- 
tered the visitor center in the north- 
ern part of the zone. Micah-IV 
continued to the end of the strip. 
The tourists would remain in the 
visitor center until he got to them, 
for the glass-walled enclosure could 
not be opened except by the warden 
on duty. In good time Micah-IV 
would open the visitor center and 

EY THE SEAWALL 



lake the humime on a cemduoted 
lour of the seawall. 

He reached the end of bis strip 
and signalled that all was well. 
Then he swung around and head- 
ed north again, moving at his meas- 
ured pace. 

He was still five hundred meters 
from the visitor center when he 
saw its door open. 

A man stepped out. He was dig- 
nified, even portly, in a gray tunic 
and a dark blue headband. As 
Micah-IV watched in amazement, 
the man walked briskly to the re- 
taining harrier and began to climb 
it. 

“StopI” Micah-rv called. 

He could not understand how 
the door of the visitor center eould 
have been opened without author- 
ization. He did not like the thought 
of an unsupervised human on the 
seawall. And he could not remotely 
sec why the man was taking the 
risk of scrambling up onto the re- 
taining barrier. 

He ran with all his incredible 
speed. 

He was too late. 

M icah-IV was still a hundred me- 
ters away when the man reach- 
ed the top of the barrier. He stood 
there flatfooted a moment, balanc- 
ing himself. Then he launched him- 
self into the air. 

“Nol” Micah-IV cried. “This is 
prohibited!” 

It was suicide — that is, deliberate 
self-destruction. The bewildered syn- 
thetic raced toward the barrier and 
taw the man activate a gravity chute 
and glide easily toward the base of 

8f 




the seawall. What was his motive? 
If he wished to kill himself, why the 
gravity chute? 

“Come back,” Micah-IV called, 
readying himself to go over the wall 
and retrieve the man, monsters of 
no. 

The man was scrambling over the 
boulders at the shoreline, and now 
he was wading hip deep in the sea, 
brushing aside the tangled coils of 
brown weeds, lying face down and 
moving his arms, propelling himself 
rapidly away from the land. Micah- 
IV did not try to follow. It would 
mean double destruction and noth- 
ing gained. 

In blank disbelief he watched the 
man swim rapidly out to sea. The 
belt of electricity did not harm him, 
since the mass of one human being 
was too slight to trigger a discharge. 
The poison zone offered no menace 
to a human metabolism. But then 
he was past the outer rim of the 
poison zone and in the open, un- 
guarded sea. 

A flash of bright scales — the 
glint of swordlike teeth — a rolling 
of the surface — 

Then all was still out there. 

T rembling, flooded with shock 
secretions, Micah-IV turned 
away. Within the visitor center were 
five other human beings, standing by 
the open door. 

“Who was that man?” Micah- 
IV demanded. “How did he get out 
onto the seawall? Why did he kill 
himself?” 

There were no answers. They all 
seemed strangely unmoved. Several 
of them request^ Micah-IV to take 



them on the tour of the seawall. Ir- 
ritably, Micah-IV told them the 
tours were canceled for the day and 
ordered them to leave the visitor 
center. 

He had had his moment of diver- 
sion at last. But he found the novel 
incident less divertin<> than he had 
anticipated. 

He reported it. Shortly his sector 
of the wall swarmed with authori- 
ties. Wearily, Micah-IV endlessly 
repeated the narrative. Experts ex- 
amined the door of the visitor center 
and showed that it had been opened 
in the usual way, with thumb sig- 
nals. Clearly the suicide had been 
privy to inside information. 

Micah-IV was reprimanded for 
having failed to prevent the suicide. 
It was no use to tell them that it 
was not his fault. Someone had to 
be blamed, and who else but the 
sector warden? Humans were not 
to be permitted on the seawall un- 
attend^. Micah-IV therefore must 
have been guilty of negligence. 

To himself, he insisted that he 
was innocent. He could not be 
everywhere on his sector at once. He 
could not run a thousand meters 
insitantaneously. If a human bent 
on self-destruction had unlawfully 
gained access to the signal code 
and was able to let himself out onto 
the seawall at a time when the at- 
tendant was elsewhere, how was the 
attendant to have prevented the act 
of suicide? 

The reprimand meant nothing 
tangible to Micah-IV. It did not 
affect his rank, his retirement status 
or his salary, for he had none of 
these things. He was not an em- 



90 



IF 




ployee but rather a part of the ap- 
paratus. But it did affect his stand- 
ing among his peers. News of the 
episode had spread. The wardens of 
other sectors were aware that Micah- 
IV had been reprimanded. He was 
shamed before his barracks-mates, 
for he had allowed a human being 
to commit suicide in his sector. 

For more than a month Micah-IV 
lived with that stigma. 

It was a great relief to him, then, 
when a second suicide was re- 
ported. 

T he circumstances were virtually 
identical to the first. A young 
woman had slipped out onto the 
wall in DV-7 while its warden was 
occupied at the opposite end of his 
sector. Drifting to the beach below 
by gravity chute, she had gone 
into the water, swimming out to 
the waiting monsters and her death. 

New security measures were put 
in force at the visitor centers. 
Micah-IV felt a sense of excite- 
ment, for now his days were mot- 
tled by unpredictabilities. There was 
little chance (that the seanbeasts 
would scale the seawall or that a 
section of the seawall would col- 
lapse, the two eventualities for 
which he was supposed to watch. 
But it was perfectly likely that at 
any given moment some irrational 
human being would go over the 
wall and invite a certain doom. 

The third suicide, in FC-10, did 
not have a gravity chute. The vic- 
tim — an adolescent boy — plum- 
meted the sixty meters to the beach 
and was shattered cn the shoreline 
rocks. Some monster was deprived 



of a snack, but the scavenger birds 
ate well. 

A fourth death was reported. 

A ftffli. 

A sixth and seventh. 

Perplexed sector wardens st^)ped 
up their pace, moving from end to 
end of their zones in two-thirds of 
the previous time. There was talk 
of closing the visitor centers al- 
together, but nothing came of it; 
it was wrong to deny millions of 
human beings the right to view the 
sea, merely because a handful were 
perverse. 

Instead, new locks were placed 
on the doors of the visitor centers. 
Despite this precaution, there were 
four suicides the following week. 

In the barracks, the sector war- 
dens were briefed on ways to cope 
with the crisis. Micah-IV listened 
attentively, feeling a certain pride 
at the knowledge that all this had 
begun in his own strip of the sea- 
wall. 

An official with oily, grayish skin 
and small green eyes addressed a 
cadre of the synthetics and told 
them, “There is now a cult of gra- 
tuitous suicide among humanity. 
You must do all in your power to 
prevent further deaths from oc- 
curring. There is nothing more pre- 
cious than a human life.” 

The official with oily, grayish skin 
and small green eyes was the twenty- 
third suicide. 

A psychiatrist with stiff, bristly 
hair spoke at a later meeting and 
declared, “The strain of the na- 
tional effort to built the seawall 
is taking a delayed toll. The citi- 
zens are attempting individually to 



BY THE SEAWALL 



91 




undo the jp-eat communal enter- 
prise by seeking death in the sea. 
Since the monsters can no longer 
come k) the land, they go to the 
monsters.” 

It was a plausible theory. The 
psychiatrist tested it hims^ sot 
long afterward. 

M icah-IV, pacing the wall through 
the salt spray and the gust- 
ing winds, did his duty. As each 
group of humans appeared — and 
there were more tourists than ever, 
now — he scanned them impassive- 
ly, wondering if he could detect 
suicidal tendencies. Will you try 
to kill yourself, you plump female? 
What about you, young man with 
too-bright eyes? You, edgy father 
of two? 

Tourists HOW came out on the 
wall in groups of three. The at- 
tendant remained close by. Despite 
this, there were several incidents 
in which humans eluded the grasp 
of the warden and plunged over 
the wall. 

In the barracks, Micah-IV listened 
with interest as Noah-I, one of the 
wisest of the synthetics, offered his 
views. 

“It is a religious phenomenon,” 
declared Noah-I. “I have studied 
religion. These people feel an 
oceanic urge. They must return to 
the great mother.” 

“And the monsters that devour?” 
asked Ezekiel- VII. 

“Irrelevant. There are always 
risks in any relationship. The swim- 
mers hope to elude the monsters 
and reach the depths of the sea. 
It is a spiritual yearning.” 



“Where will it end?” Uzziah-IU 
inquired^ 

“Perhaps the wall will be takea 
down,” suggested Noah-I. “Per- 
haps some new cult will arise. Or 
perhaps all the humans, one by one, 
will throw themselves into the sea.” 

There were further deaths. Sever- 
al hundred humans had perished^ 
HOW, and nearly every ten-sector 
overgroup had recorded its suicide. 
Now precautions were enforced. It 
was hoped that the onset of win- 
ter would create a change im the 
prevailing psychological climate, but 
the pattern of self-destructiom was 
not broken. 

On a day when specks of snow 
dropped from a gray sky, Micak-IV 
prevented a suicide. 

He had detected signs im ad- 
vance: the bulge of a gravity chute 
beneath the clothing of a red-haired 
woman and a certain glossiness 
about her eyes. When he led his 
group of tourists out onto the sea- 
wall, he watched her closely. 

“There,” he said, pointing, “is 
one of the enemies of mankind now. 
See the fluked tail? See the great 
spearlike tusks? See the clawed flip- 
pers?” 

The red-haired woman broke 
from the group and bolted toward 
the retaining barrier. 

M icah-IV, who had been expect- 
ing some such action, moved 
swiftly after her. She was crouch- 
ing beside the barrier, activating 
the gravity chute. Lately, the bar- 
riers had been wired to give a mild 
electric shock, so that it was dis- 
couraging to try to climb one. Yet 



92 



IF 




with a gravity diute it was no hard 
feat the leap comfdetely over the 
barrier. As the woman coiled her 
muscles for the le£^, Micah-IV 
closed his hand around her arm 
and held her in place. 

“The rest of you!” he shouted. 
“Inside! Inside at once!” 

The other two tourists rushed 
into the visitor center. Micah-IV 
grasped the would-be suicide firm- 
ly- 

“Let go of me,” she demanded. 
“Why do you wish to jump?” 
“None of your business! Let go! 
Let go!” 

“You will die in the sea.” 

“What‘s that to you? You filthy 
robot, how can you defy a human 
being’s orders? Let go of me and 
let me jump!” 

“I am a synthetic, not a robot,” 
Micah-IV reminded h^ gently. “I 
am not required to obey human 
orders except as they follow my 
programming. I foibid you to leave 
the seawall.” Efficiently he pulled 
the gravity chute from under her 
clothing and unsnapped its activa- 
tor, without releasing his grip on 
the woman. She glowered at him. 

“Tell me why you want to go 
to the sea,” he ask^ 

“You’d never understand. You’re 
just a machine.” 

“Genetically I am nearly human. 
I can think and reflect and change 
my ideas. This is of great concern 
to me. Why do you want to go 
to the sea?” 

‘To belong to it,” said the 
woman. 

“I do not understand.” 

“I told you you wouldn’t. Don’t 



deprive me of it Let me jump!” 
“I cannot do that,” Micah-IV 
informed her and dragged her 
toward safety. Her words cut him 
deeply. He had had little conversa- 
tion with human beings in his life- 
time, and he had never before been 
so blunty reminded of his non- 
human status. Perhaps he was a 
laboratory product, but he had feel- 
ings. She had wounded them. He 
gave way slightly to the emotion 
of self-pity. 

As they neared the cubicle that 
was the visitor center, Micah-IV’s 
foot slipped in a patch of melt- 
ing snow. Within an instant he re- 
covered his balance, but that was 
just enough time for the red-haired 
woman to pull from his grasp and 
run to the seawall barrier. Mioah 
followed her. She reached the elec- 
trified barrier and vaulted it, her 
hair momentarily standing on end 
like wire, and then she was gone, 
tumbling downward, drafting on the 
wind, smashing against the jagged 
rocks below. Scavengers gathered. 

I will be severely reprimanded for 
this, Micah-IV told himself. 
There were witnesses. Througii 
my negligence I allowed h^ to 
destroy herself. 

He stared at the gray, winter- 
churned sea. He saw dark, huge 
shapes beyond the poison belt. 

Why do they kill themsdves? 
What do they find in the sea? What 
drives them to do such things? 

He did not know. I do not un- 
derstand because I am not human, 
he thought. 

Absently, Micah-IV climbed to

On The 



Shallow Seas 

by ROBERT MASON 

The world was lovely — for a jail — and 
the convicts could buy their freedom, if 
they wanted to. Perhaps with their lives! 



Illustrated by BURNS

(4 A 11 right, you jail birds, on your 
feet. Time to get and go 
look for your freedom.” The guard 
laughed, his face twisted in its usual 
sadistic sneer. 

Lant rubbed the fog from his 
eyes. It seemed he’d hardly slept 
more than seconds, but he realized 
it was only his mental state. 



The guard was getting his mcMii- 
ing kicks. By the time the chow 
bell sounded, one or more of the 
prisoners would be in the hospit^, 
or in solitary for assaulting a guard. 
Every morning it was die same 
way. First he would oome into the 
cell block shouting, running his dub 
up and down the bars imtR k made 
your teeth ratde. Just when you 
felt like killing him yourself, he 



95 




would stop. Then he would fo to 
the nearest window, while the anger 
he*d caused seemed to fill the whole 
edl block. The cons Would watch 
as he stared out the window, wait- 
ing for the ome who would have 
to answer nature’s call after be- 
ing confined to his bed all night 
Lant made a game of guessing 
how far the guard would let them 
get, before he got his kicks. 

This morning the guard waited 
longer than usual. The prisoner had 
just entered the cubicle. Faster than 
anyone would have thought possible, 
the guard was there. If the con 
tried to hold his temper, the guard 
took it as a provocation to go fur- 
ther. 

Everyone in the block knew what 
was coming next. Already shouts of 
anger echoed from the other pris- 
oners. “Lay off, screwl” 

Lant headed toward the wash- 
room, staying out of it. Better to 
take the names and taunts from the 
others than to get his head pow- 
dered by the guard’s vibrator club. 
Several other convicts evidently felt 
the same as he did, but he ignored 
them — as they did him. 

T he turmoil outside reached its 
height. Even through the door 
the zzztl zzztl of the vibrator club 
the screams of those it fell against 
and the thud of falling bodies could 
be clearly heard. 

Lant washed slowly, the face in 
the broken mirror before him 
strange and unreal. Finished, he 
dressed. No sense going back into 
the block until the fight ended. As 
he strapped on his mud boots, he 



noticed his ankles were etched with 
small white lines on the reddened, 
swollen skin. He cursed, “Dammed 
vampire ticks; Why couldn’t they 
eat from something that didn’t need 
all its strength just to stay alive?" 
Btill mumbling to himself he put 
on the rags they gave him for 
clothes. Could be worse, he thought. 
At least he had a good coat. And so 
far hadn’t fell victim to mud fever 
or swamp rot. 

Frelon appeared in the door. 
Lant was relieved to see him. 
noring the why didn't you help? 
look in his eyes. Lant slipped him 
the soap. It had taken them six 
months to acquire it. They concealed 
it from the others, protected it, used 
it sparingly. The day they snitched 
it from the guard house, they had 
spent hours holding it, simply con- 
tent to stare at it. To touch and 
smell it was pure heaven, to men 
who hadn’t had soap for over four 
years. 

Lant remained silent until Frelon 
finished washing. 

“Where are you going to look 
today? Have you decided?” 

“Thought I’d try the mud flat 
around Prisoners Island,” Frelon re- 
plied. 

“I’m heading for the shallows 
around East Island. Anyway we 
won’t waste our time both looking 
in the same spot.” 

The siren atop the mess hall 
sounded. Both men covered their 
ears to drown out the whine. 

On the way to the mess hall 
they passed the latrine. Three cons 
still lay where the guard had felled 
them. Damned fools, Lant thought. 



96 



IF 




There were always a few who never 
realized one guard with a vibrator 
club was the equal of any ten men 
without one. 

Outside, he could see it was go- 
ing to be another typical day on 
Exonan. Lant remembered the day 
he had arrived there. Half dead 
drugged from the long trip, he had 
been kicked and shoved from one 
place to another. 

First there were the shots for 
everything you could think of. Then 
shots for things Lant had never 
heard of. 

Then the physical examination. 
Some examination that was! The 
doctor was a convict also. He look- 
ed upon his job with about as much 
interest as a rich man would show 
if he saw a penny laying on the 
sidewalk. Of each new arrival he 
asked the same questions, man after 
man. He never examined anyone 
personally. 

“Any diseases? Anything wrong 
with your arms or legs? Any reason 
you can’t do a full day’s work?” 

The instant you replied “No“ 
your physical examination was over. 
On the other hand if you complained 
of an ailment, you were given ten 
lashes for trying to get out of 
work. 

Then came the speech by the 
deputy warden. The warden was too 
busy — later Lant found out that 
too drunk was the real reason. 

L ant passed Crazy as he entered 
die mess hall. Crazy belonged 
in a nut house; anywhere else in 
the galaxy he would have been in 
one. Crazy had tried to escape one 



night. Somehow he’d found a way 
to get out of the cell block without 
getting knocked out by the electric 
charge in the floor. Hs’d scaled the 
wall without too much trouble and 
got about a mile from the prison 
when one or more of the creatures 
that roamed the nights had fallen 
upon him. 

The guards had found him the 
next morning, clawing and scream- 
ing, at the gates. The wounds he 
had received, though serious, healed, 
but his mind didn’t. Crazy spent 
his time now crawling around on 
his hands and knees. 

Lant k^t one eye on him, as he 
went by. 

Crazy hurled himself across the 
floor, his knees scraping on the 
rough boards. Lant kicked him — 
hard — square in the face; still 
Crazy came on, his teeth gnashing 
in the air. Lant kicked him in the 
mouth this time. Cra2:y stopped, 
started to come on, drew his lips 
back to reveal splintered and 
bloodied teeth. 

Lant drew his foot back to kick 
again. “Get awayl So help me. I’ll 
kick you to death!” 

Crazy started to come on. Then 
pivoting, he scrambled away down 
the hall and out of sight into the 
yard, his animal screams echoing 
back. 

Lant cursed him — cursed him for 
what he was, and cursed him for 
forcing him to be so cruel. A short 
time after his arrival, Lant had ran 
into Crazy. Unaware of the man’s 
mental condition he had felt only 
pity for him. 

Six days later, they released him 



ON THE SHALLOW SEAS 



9T 




from the hospital. It was six weeks 
before the bite wounds healed com- 
pletely. 

At breakfast, Lant ate in silence. 
It was an unwritten rule there, not 
to speak to anyone except your bud- 
die. Everyone had one or two dose 
friends looking out for and con- 
tributing to the welfare of the 
others. Lant had chosen Frelon out 
of all the rest. To make a care- 
less friendship there was dangerous. 
Lant had been careful. 

As he ate, Lant looked around. 
Some of the faces were new this 
morning. 

That was no surprise to him. He’d 
heard two guards discussing a load 
of fish the week before. Even if he 
hadn’t overheard them, he would 
have known the new men by the 
fresh, scared look on their faces. 
Lant knew from the past that as 
the days her 3 passed the shine would 
disappear from their eyes. The look 
of hope would turn to a look of 
dismay — the look of forever be- 
ing dirty, hungry, tired. Then more 
often then not, it would turn into 
the faraway gaze of a caged animal. 
They would very seldom look up 
from the ground when they walked. 
Eventually their once erect bodies 
would assume the stoop of the old. 

Finished with his breakfast, Lant 
waited to see if anyone left anything 
on his plate. The prisoners were 
only fed breakfast and supper and 
then only if they earned it. It was 
hardly enough to keep a sparrow 
alive. 

Rarely, someone who was sick — 
or, as this morning, new to the food 
— would leave some of his meal. 



Then there would be a terrible 
struggle among the others. On more 
than one day he had seen men die 
over a scrap of food you could put 
in half a spoon. 

This morning no scraps were left 
by anyone. Disappointed, Lant left 
the mess hall. 

The day on Exonan started at 
four in the morning, long before 
the planet’s small sun rose. The day 
ended at seven each night. During 
the day the prisoners were ex- 
pected to earn their keep by hunting 
for . golden oysters I 

II 

T his was the only thing of value 
found on Exonan. When golden 
oysters had first been discovered, 
thousands had flocked to the planet 
from all parts of the galaxy. Gold 
had became the rarest metal known 
to mankind; just an ounce of it was 
worth enough to retire for life on. 
The bonanza soon turned into a 
nightmare. So rare were oysters that 
contained gold pearls that many who 
had come to make their fortune 
soon left broke and disgusted. Those 
that stayed and kept looking either 
fell victim to the elements or simply 
were never heard from again! 

Because of the value of gold the 
prison had been built there: 

To give the prisoners a reason 
to hunt for golden oysters, they were 
offered as a reward for finding one 
with a pearl of gold in it, their 
freedom and their transportation to 
any of the planets. 

Besides the offer of freedom for 
finding a gold pearl, the prisoners 



98 



IF 




were expected to bring in sixty 
pounds of oyster meat eaoh day, to 
pay for their keep. To fail to do 
so would mean no supper that night. 
Failure to bring in the required 
amount three days straight would 
result in a terrible beating by the 
guards, followed by five days in 
solitary confinment. 

More than one con had gone 
into solitary confinment, never to 
be seen again. Word had spread 
among the cons that the head guard 
in solitary was a sadist who derived 
his pleasure from torturing the pris- 
oners while they were there. 

Lant had been there five years, 
almpst six. He was consider^ an 
old-timer by all standards, but had 
never come close to finding an oys- 
ter with a gold pearl in it. He would 
have given up hope of ever find- 
ing one long ago if he hadn’t seen 
the ones others had found. 

The excitement would sweep 
through the prison like wildfire! The 
pearl would be put on display in 
the main yard, heavily guarded to 
protect it from the prisoners that 
would gather to see and touch it. 
That was freedom they were looking 
at, a chance for a new life! 

The fortunate prisoner that had 
found it would be there, all smiles, 
usually enclosed by an unseen glow 
of happiness that filled the air. 

Again and again he was asked 
the same question. “Where did you 
find it?” “How far from what land- 
mark?” And on and on for hours. 

In most cases, the smile and hap- 
piness of the con about to gain his 
freedom was reflected in the tears 
of those he would leave behind. 



W hen the siren sounded to start 
work, Lant took all the time 
he could getting to his crawler. 

The prisoners called it a crawler; 
the proper name was W.M.A.L.C., 
which stood for water, mud and land 
craft. A crawler was about six feet 
long, about four feet wide, stood 
above the water when empty about 
ten inches. It was powered by a 
small outboard motor fitted with a 
set of remote controls, that enabled 
the prison guards to bring it back 
whenever they pleased. Lant checked 
the gas tank first to make sure it 
was full. He’d heard tell of some 
who went out and didn’t return 
because they ran out of gas. Next 
he went to the supply shack and 
checked out an oyster blade, check- 
ing to be sure it was razor sharp 
and wasn’t about to break in two. 
He wasn’t about to die because the 
only weapon he had failed when 
needed the most. 

He started the crawler’s motor, 
then listened carefully for several 
minutes for the faintest sign or 
sound that the motor wasn’t run- 
ning properly. Satisfied he idled 
the craft back into the main canal. 
Lant held the crawler’s speed down 
to a creep until he reached the 
checkout gate. Two crawlers were 
ahead of him; he shifted to neutral 
until he was waved forward. 
“Number?” the guard asked. 
“4672,” Lant answered. 

One guard checked the craft, 
while the other guard bolted the 
returner on, activated it with his 
key and for the thousandth time 
reminded Lant, “Remember, you 
only have twenty minutes to return 



ON THE SHALLOW SEAS 



99 





to your crawler before we bring it 
back at night. Remember you have 
only twenty minutes aft^ the siren 
sounds.” 

‘ Lant nodded. He knew very well 
what would happen if he wasn’t 
aboard whon his crowier returned. 
During the worldng hours you could 
go where ever you pleased, as long 
as it was away from the prison and 
as long as no other prisoner was 
within two hundred yards of you. 
The guards, no one would bother 
you all day. The prison authorities 
knew there was no place for you 
to go. No matter how far away 
you went, come night you would 
have to return to the safety of the 
> prison walls. 

At night creatures too horrible to 
^ describe roamed the watery lands of 
‘ Exonan. Lant had seen half a dozen 
-of their bodies, half-eaten things 
with fanged teeth and long sharp 
feet. Just the thought of meet- 
ing one of diem at night was 
enough to send chills down your 
spine. Some times you could hear 
them outside the prison walls at 
night, howling and fighting among 
'themselves. 

His little speech finished, the 
guard waved Lant out. “Number 
4672 cleared.” 

The guaird’s warning still fresh in 
his ears, he slammed the crawler 
into high gear. Soon the prison’s 
dirty gray walls became just a blur 
in the distance behind him. Lant 
knew that about twenty minutes to 
seven that evening the alarm on the 
crawler would begin to bleep. After 
twenty minutes the returner would 
start the motor and return the craw- 



100 



IF 




ler to the prison — with or with- 
out anyone aboard! He had learned 
to tell the time of day by the angle 
the sim hit the water. He made it 
a point always to work as close as 
possible to his crawler late in the 
day. 

L ant set his course for a small 
island he had marked on his 
map. The map had xxxx’s all over 
it, to indicate the many places he 
had looked. He’d found plenty of 
oysters all right. Trouble was none 
of them had contained even the 
slightest sign of a gold pearl. Where 
others had found them, he had 
searched, for miles around the spot 
without any luck. Lant had never 
wasted a minute. The only time dur- 
ing the day he wasn’t in the water 
was when he was between the prison 
and where he was going or when he 
was going to a different place to 
look. 

The crawler’s motor died; he had 
arrived at his destination. He took 
his mud boots off, tied them secure- 
ly to the bow to make sure they 
weren’t lost overboard. Then, mak- 
ing sure his oyster blade was secure- 
ly tied to his waist, he eased him- 
self over the side into the water. 
The water was just the right temper- 
ature, for a change. Some days the 
water was so hot it made you sweat 
after you had been in for only 
a few minutes. Exonan was almost 
completely covered with water, 
which as far as he could be told was 
constantly heated by underground 
streams that passed through the 
planet’s mantle, where they were 
heated to very high temperatures. 



Lant eased himself into the water 
until his feet touched the bottom. 
The water was just the depth he 
liked for hunting oysters; it came 
to his chest, which meant he 
wouldn’t have to dive to look. He 
slid his feet along in front of him. 
He had done it so often, for so 
long, that he had developed a 
rhythm — right, left — right, left. 
He slid his feet along before him 
as he went around the crawler, al- 
ways going in a wider circle. 

The eighth time around, he found 
his first oyster. Not bad, he thought. 
Usually he circled the crawler un- 
til he was a block away, before 
he found the first one. On some 
occasions, he had gone much farther 
without finding anything. 

Carefully, so carefully, he ran his 
foot across it until he found the 
horns. Then, slowly!, the beat of 
his heart sounding in his ears, he 
counted them! One two, three, four! 
— He waited, relieved it wasn’t a 
cannibal oyster, until his heart set- 
tled down to a more normal beat. 

Then bending down, until his 
chin rested oh top the water, he 
worked his oyster blade under the 
oyster’s shell. Although called gold- 
en oysters they were not like the 
oysters of any other planet. They 
were shaped like oysters, but there 
it ended. On the unhinged side 
of their shell, a growth ran from 
them. Usually it was anchored se- 
curely into the muddy bottom, 
sometimes to an object or a crop 
of rock. Locating the growth where 
it was attached to the bottom, he 
cut it with a quick slashing motion. 
At the same time he grabbed the 



ON THE SHALLOW SEAS 



101 




now wildly thrashing oyster. Carry- 
ing it back to the crawler, he toss^ 
it onboard. The oyster was about 
the average size, sli^tly smaller then 
a wash tub. It clashed its halves to- 
gether and beat against the bottom 
of the crawler, until it died. 

Lant pulled himself aboard. He 
bent down over the oyster, asked 
himself again: Was this the one? 

How many times had he asked 
himself that question? Placing the 
blade in the crack between the two 
halves, he pushed with all his might. 
After several minutes, he rested. 
Even after death, the oyster’s mus- 
cles refused to let the shell apart. 
Rested, he tried once more. Setting 
his feet firmly he pushed as hard 
as he was able. The blade plunged 
deep into the oyster. Lant whipped 
it back and forth until he was sure 
the muscles were cut enou^ to en- 
able him to pry the two halves 
apart. With both hands he opened 
the oyster. The meat had a vicdet 
look outside; inside it was a deep 
green. To the touch, it was like 
handling butter. Tlie smell was the 
worst, like dead fish in a hot sun. 
Quickly he cut the meat out, tossing 
it in the gwiera! direction of the 
cans. The hinge exposed he stopped. 
Poking his finger into the holes along 
the shdl’s hinge, he found noth- 
ing. A dud. A damned dudi Noth- 
ing. This wasn’t his lucky oyster. 

Lant finished cutting the meat 
out of the ^dl, then packed it 
into the cans furnished him for 
that purpose. 

W hen the alarm sounded on the 
crawler, he’d found two more. 



None with the pearl in it he sought 
for so vainly. When the alarm went 
off he was in the process of cut- 
ting the meat out of the last oyster 
he had found. It more than ^ed 
the cans he had. He threw all die 
extra meat back, with the exception 
of a large piece. This he would 
eat himself to supplement the lean 
diet the prisoners were fed. Lant 
would like to have cooked it but 
he had neither the time or the 
means, so he ate it raw. To him it 
was delicious I 

Hardly had he finished, when the 
crawler’s motor started up and with 
a jerk it swung about until it was 
headed on the correct course for the 
prison. 

He was one of the last ones to 
arrive. 

“Number?” the guard asked. 

“4672,” Lant repUed. 

“Let’s have your meat cans.” Ihe 
guard weighed them to make sure 
they contained the required amoimt 
of oyster meat. “Nurn^r 4672 okay 
for supper,” he shouted down to 
another guard. “Pass on,” he or- 
dered. 

Lant let his crawler run onto tiie 
sand enough to keep it from drift- 
ing away. The boat keeper came 
over and began looking it over. 

“•Everything run okay?” he asked. 

“If it hadn’t, you wouldn’t be 
asking me now, would you?” Lant 
replied. 

“Look, buddy, don’t get huffy 
with me. I only wanted to know if 
you thought your crawler needed 
any repairs?” 

“Sorry,” Lant said, “I had a lousy 
day.” 



102 



IF 




“Don’t we all,” Lant heard the 
keeper say as he walked away. 

Lant strolled around the prison 
yard, waiting for the day’s find 
to be posted on the bulletin board. 
Frelon joined him. They 'both 
strolled for several minutes, neither 
speaking. Finally Frelon spoke. 
“Any luck?” 

Lant smiled at the joke. “No.” 
“Lant I want you to hunt with me 
tomorrow.” 

L ant stopped, turned to Frelon. 

“You know twd prisoners 
aren’t allowed to hunt together. 
What’s so special about tomorrow?” 
“I need your help.” 

“What kind of help?” Lant was 
interested now. 

“I found an oyster so large I 
can’t even lift it off the bottom, 
that’s what!” 

Lant studied his face for several 
seconds. Frelon was dead serious. 

“You’re not kidding me, are you, 
old buddy?” 

“Lant, I swear it was as large as 
my crawler.” 

Lant didn’t answer for some time. 
An oyster as large as the one Fre- 
lon described was unheard of. 

“All right,” Lant finally said. 
“Only we’ll leave here in different 
directions. I’ll meet you bdiind Con- 
vict Rock. Okay?” 

“Swell.” 

The conversation ended when a 
guard came into the yard to post 
the day’s find. It told the usual 
story. No pearls had been found. 
They all knew that. If anyone had 
found a pearl the place would be 
torn up in excitement. Three men 



failed to bring in the required 
amount of oyster meat; no supper 
for them. One prisoner failed to 
return with his crawler. A search 
party had been sent out — it said. 
The prisoners knew that was a lie. 

“Christ, what a lousy place,” 
Lant said out loud. 

Supper was the usual mixture of 
swamp worm and mud pig. Tonight 
it was boiled, tomorrow fried. Tasted 
the same either way. The coffee 
was the same too, powdered from 
some place called Japan — no, it 
was from some place called “Made 
in Japan!” 

After supper Lant went straigjht 
to his cell. He took the mattress off 
his bed, searched it carefully. The 
springs he searched just as care- 
fully. The bed frame revealed noth- 
ing, neither did a slow search of 
the walls and the floor around it. 
Jerking the only blanket they were 
allowed from the shelf he went over 
it, then the shelf itself. Nothing! He 
knew that stinking vampire tick was 
close by, somewhere. Once a vam- 
pire tick tasted blood from a vic- 
tim, it seldom went far away — 
until it was killed, or the victim 
died! Night by night, his life’s blood 
was being sucked from him and 
would continue 'being lost until he 
found the tick. 

Before he could search further 
the warning bell rang. The bell was 
to warn the prisoners that they oMy 
had two minutes to get into bed 
'before the floor would be turned on 
for the night. 

At night the floors of the cell 
blocks were charged electrically. 
Anyone foolish enough to step on 



ON THE SHALLOW SEAS 



103 




them was knocked cold instantly. 
At the same time an alarm was 
sounded in the guard house, if it 
was your first dme, they would 
just laugh it off. The next time 
resulted in a beating for disturbing 
their sleep, ^eepwalkers here were 
quickly cured — or Idlled] Crazy 
was the only con Lant had ever 
heard of who had found out how 
to get over the floor safely. 

L ant had a terrible time falling 
asleep. Every time be shut his 
eyes the face of the judge that had 
sentenced him would appear. The 
bald head with the eyes of sentenc- 
ing would shout to many people 
over and over, “Life, life, life, life! 
That’s what you get, life!” And on 
and on until Lant would be wide 
awake, only then to realize it was 
just a dream. 

His right leg felt numbed. He 
moved it a Ikde and fek something 
else : That dammed vampire tick 
was backi In his mind he could 
picture it, snuggjed up tight against 
his leg. The tick’s diamond-shaped 
mouth would be making little cir- 
cular motions, its spongy tongue 
lapping up tiie blood as fast as 
it flowed from him, its belly swelling 
as it ate. He cau^t the tick and 
flung it away, feeling the skin tear 
from his leg as he did it, stiffling the 
cry of pain in his throat. He heard 
the thud as it struck the charged 
floor. Lant lay back down, thank- 
ing his ludcy stars that the tick 
wasn’t large enough to short out 
the floor snd set off the alarm. 

He lay there, tears half filling 
his eyes. He just had to find an 



oyster with a pearl in it — before 
he went out of his head as another 
prisoner had done. He had cheated 
the law out of his anguish by put- 
ting his head down one the 
electric toilets. When they found 
him the suction had tom his head 
off. 

“All right, you mugs! On your 
feet! Time to get up and go look 
for your freedom.” The guard’s 
voice seemed to get louder each 
day. 

Lant cursed under his breath. 
“Some day you’ll get yours screw. 
Wait and sec.” 

As his feet touched the floor 
some thing wet and sticky squashed 
between his toes. It startl^ him 
before he realized it was only the 
tick he’d killed last night. For the 
first time he noticed the dark stain 
on the wall. How, he wondered, 
could such a small thing eat so 
much. He picked it up, nothing now 
but a small mess of blood and fur. 
On the way to wash up he threw 
it away. 

Frelon stopped by, long enough 
to make sure he hadn’t forgot about 
meeting him. 

Lant didn’t waste time {^lecking 
his crawler out today. This was the 
day when the mail clerk would hand 
each prisoner his mail, if any, as 
he passed through the check gate. 
Lant waited patiently as others be- 
fore him were checked out. Fi- 
nally it was his turn. He idled into 
the gate, his eyes fixed on the mail 
clerk. 

“Number?” 

“ 4672 .” 

The usual wait while the re- 



104 



IF 




turner was bolted <m, Tlien the 
broken-record reminder. 

“One prisoner didn’t come back 
yesterday. Remember you have only 
twenty minutes to get back aboard 
your crawler after the alarm sounds.” 

Finished with his speech, the 
guard waved him out. 

The mail clerk always waited un- 
til the last moment to hand you 
your mail, if you had any. Lant 
figured he got some sort of satis- 
faction in making each prisoner 
sweat it out until the last possible 
moment. Just as the guard shouted 
for him to get out of the gate, 
the clerk handed him a letter. 

Lant set the crawler on a course 
to Convict Rock. 

The letter was from the only one 
who wrote him any more, his wife. 
Lant had told her over and over 
again to get a divorce and start a 
new life for herself, but she had 
ignored him. Her letter was the 
usual stuff. Tbe weather back home 
was hot. Uncle Joe was in the hos- 
pital. She had a new job, paid ten 
bucks more than the last one. She 
had appiied again for his par- 
don . 

It was the usual nonsense. None 
of it mattered. Here only one thing 
mattered: to find the golden oyster. 

IV 

C onvict Rock loomed into view — 
so named because of the odd 
way the water had eaten a hole 
through it, leaving bars across the 
opening. 

Lant shut his crawler off and let 
it coast alongside Frelon’s. 



“See anyone else headed this 
way,” Frelon asked. 

“Not a soul.” Lant was nervous. 
For two prisoners to be foimd 
together outside the prison would 
result in serious punishment. “Let’s 
get on with it,” he said. 

Frelon hesitated, his eyes search- 
ing the horizon for sign of an- 
other boat. “Okay, follow me.” 
Lant watched around him all the 
way there. Not the smsdlest speck 
came into view. They had traveled 
about thirty minutes; he was just 
going to pull alongside and ask 
how much further, when Frelon 
signalled him to slow down. Fre- 
lon seemed to be taking bearing 
from some invisible landmark. 

First he swung ri^t, then left, 
circled back to almost the same spot 
they’d started from. Finally he 
straightened out for perhaps a hun- 
dred yards; started to turn around 
again then swung sharply left and 
stopped dead. 

Lant pulled alongside and tied his 
boat to Frelan’s. The object Fre- 
lon had been searching for turned 
out to be a small buoy. When Fre- 
lon pulled it in, he was surprised 
to see it had been made out of the 
float from a toilet bowl. The an- 
chor was an empty oyster sheU. 
“This the place?” 

“Well, not exactly,” Frelon smil- 
ed. “But it’s within twenty feet, 
one way or the other.” 

It was huge! Lant had thought 
at the most that Frelon had exagger- 
ated. At first he thought it was 
nothing but a boulder laying on 
the bottom. But after Frelon show- 
ed him where the horns were, and 



ON THE SHALLOW SEAS 



105 




after he’d counted them, aH Lant 
could do was to look dumbfounded. 

Lant dove down, ran his hands 
along its entire length. It registered 
on his mind that an oyster tiiat 
big, covered with that amount of 
moss, must be the granddaddy of all 
oysters. 

Maybe, he diought, just maybe 
this was the one. 

Back aboard the crawler he asked 
Frelon. “How will we ever get it 
out? We can’t lift it, that’s for sure.” 

“We won’t.” Frdon replied. “We’ll 
kill it right where it lies. Out it 
open, clean the meat out and 
see if it has a pearl, all under 
water.” 

Lant nodded approvd. He laugh- 
ed. “It would be just our luck that 
the pearl would be too big to lift 
out of the water.” 

Frelon joined in the laughter. 
“Hey!” he said, “wouldn’t that get 
them back at the prison?” 

Still laughing, both began to 
remove their boots. Lant strapped 
his oyster blade around his waist. 
Frelon didn’t bother. “We’ll take 
turns with just one. You cut, then 
ril cut. Okay?” 

“Suits me,” Lant replied. “I’ll go 
first.” 

Lant breathed in and out rapid- 
ly, trying to get as much oxygen into 
his system as possible. 

The water was murky. It took 
him too long to locate the growth 
that held the oyster to the bottom. 
Out of air, he surfaced, sucked in 
a huge amount of fresh air and dove 
back down. 

Lant chopped at the growth, but 
his swings lost most of their force. 



from the drag of the water. Up, 
get a breath. Down, chop; up, get 
another breath. He chopped feebly 
at the growth. Up, get another 
breath, down, then chop. Spots of 
intense white appeared before his 
eyes. Exhausted, he swam back to 
the crawler — then found he didn’t 
have enough strength to pull him- 
self aboard. 

Frelon grabbed him by the arms 
and pulled him aboard. “You all 
right?” 

All Lant could do was say, “your 
turn now.” 

Frelon took the blade from him, 
strapped it around his own waist 
and widiout another word plunged 
into the water. He found the growth. 
Like Lant the water slowed his 
swings down. The growth was hard- 
ly notched when Lant went down 
again. 

It was going to be a long day. 

M any dives later, Lant came up, 
puffing, red faced and smiling. 
Frelon reached for the blade at his 
side. 

Gasping for breath, Lant clutched 
his arm. “Never mind, it’s cut in 
two.” 

Frelon realized then how much 
the task had taken out of him. Now 
that he looked, he could see the 
boiling water, the churning, mud- 
died water, as the oyster thra^ed 
about below in its death throes. 

It was some time before either 
of them spoke. 

“Now what?” Lant asked, gazing 
at the muddy water around them. 

“Now we cut it open. We’ll take 
both blades for this.” 



106 



IF 




“I sure hope this is all worth the 
trouble,” muttered Lant. 

The first thing that struck Lant, 
after he entered the water was 
how hard it was going to be. He 
could hardly see a foot through 
the murk. He had no idea where 
the oyster was now, ict alone Fre- 
lon. When he surfaced, he found 
Frelon had the same trouble. 

Frelon sputtered, “Let’s join hands 
until we find the oyster. All the 
thrashing around it did, it’s bound 
to have moved.” 

Taking a deep breath, they dove 
under. At first nothing was visible 
to them. As their eyes became ad- 
justed to the gloom, to their sur- 
prise they found they had dived right 
on top of the oyster. 

It took sever^ trips up for air 
before they managed to get both 
blades inserted in the shell. After 
several tries to pry it open, Lant 
signaled to Frelon to surface. 

“It’s no use, Frelon. We’ll never 
get it open.” 

“We must,” Frdon gasped. 

“I want it open as much as you 
do ” Lant replied. “But let’s face 
it. We just aren’t that str<Kig.” 

Frelon plunged back under the 
water. 

Lant waited for him to come back 
up. And waited. Still he hadn’t sur- 
faced. Lant dove beneath the water, 
clearer now. 

Frelon had planted both feet on 
top of the oyster’s shell and was 
pulling back, almost to the point of 
breaking them, on both blades! 

Lant could tell he was on the 
brink of unconsciousness. He grab- 
bed him, signaUing him to go up. 



ON THE SHALLOW SEAS 




Frelon shook his head — no! 

Unable to get him to rise, Lant 
took hold of one of the blades, 
signalling Frelon to puli. Still, they 
were unable to open the oyster. Lant, 
out of breath, rose to the surface. 
Frelon still didn’t come up. Diving 
back down to him, Lant found him 
stUl firmly gripping his blade. 

One look told Lant all he needed 
to know. Little bubbles of air rose 
from Frelon’s mouth and nose. Lant 
jerked at his arms, trying to break 
his grip on the oyster Wade. Frelon 
had a death grip! Lant slugged him, 
twice, as hard as he was able. Fre- 
lon floated loose. 

When Frelon opened his eyes 
again he was aware of motion be- 
neath him. Ahead the water flowed 
toward him. 

Turning, his gaze fell onto Lant’s 
worried face. 

“Glad to see you’re badk with 
me. I thought for a whSe you were 
a goner.” 

“Where we going?” Frelon asked, 
noticing that his crawler was tied 
on behind Lant’s. 

“After I got you out, my friend 
— you damned fool! — the alarm 
went off on our crawlers. So I re- 
trieved our blades, tied your crawler 
behind mine and here we are.” 

“What about the oyster?” 

“I left it there! Let’s face it, 
we never would have got it open. 
We tried. You know how hard we 
tried.” 

“Yeah, sure,” Frelon said dully. 
Then: “We’d better split. Wouldn’t 
do to return together. On top of 
not bringing in any meat, they’d 
probably shoot us.” 



Lant could see nothing to say 
that would help. 

As soon as Frelon’s crawler was 
free Lant sat down on the front of 
his. Getting a good grip on the 
sides with his hands, he lowered 
both his hands, he lowered both 
feet into the water. The additional 
drag he created soon let Frdon’s 
crawler get ahead of him. He stayed 
that way until Frelon was out of 
sight. 

Lant ignored the gate guard’s 
comment. So he missed a meal. He 
looked everywhere for Frelon. Then 
the warning buzzer sounded to get 
in bed. He gave up. 

L ant woke with a start, the shrill 
howl of the sirens filling his 
head. Some damned fool must have 
touched the floor .... 

Then he became aware of the 
lights flashing across the cell win- 
dows. Someone was trying to es- 
cape. 

Now he could pick out the shouts 
and footsteps of the guards as they 
hurried to their posts. There was 
a rush of feet and guards were sud- 
denly pouring into the cell block 
from both ends. They were armed 
to the teeth. Not the usual vibra- 
tors; this time they carried stun 
rifles. 

“On your feet! Stand at the foot 
of your bunks.” 

TTie prisoners obeyed instantly. 
Stun guns weren’t to be fooled with! 

The warden and his assistant en- 
tered. It was obvious the warden 
was agitated. He shouted orders 
rapidly. “Hurry up! Check them, 
on the double.” 



108 



IF 




The cell captains started up the 
sides. It was their re^KMisiUll^ to 
know each and prisoner by 

sight. 

The one down at the far end op- 
posite Lant stopped. **Sir, number 
2395 is missing.** 

“What’s his name?’* the warden 
shouted hack. 

“Frelon Manton.” 

Lant closed his eyes. How had 
the fool -got over the floor? And 
— why? 

The warden and the guard cap- 
tains conferred for several minutes. 
Then the warden and one of the 
captains walked down to where Lant 
stood. 

“Frelon was your buddy, wasn’t 
he?” 

“Yes.” 

“He must have confided in you. 
He must have told you he was go- 
ing to try to escape. He probably 
asked you to go too.** 

“No! He didn’t even menti — *’ 
The slap was so vicious, so sud- 
den, it took Lant comptetely by 
surprise. The taste of Mood filling 
his mouth angered him even more. 
“You dirty screw!” he shouted at 
the captain who had struck him. 
“Don’t take it out on me because 
you can’t handle your job.” 

The guard’s hand raised to strike 
again. 

“Do that again, and I’ll kill you!” 
Lant said, his eyes boring his an- 
ger into the guard’s. “Some way, 
somehow, I swear!” 

Before the guard could decide, 
shouts rang out from the corridor. 

“We’ve foimd him. Warden! He’s 
on the west wall.” 



L ant rushed to his cell window. 

All he could make out was the 
bright glare of spoflights. Suddenly 
a movement caught his eye. It was 
Frelon! 

Frelon hung -there, about two feet 
short of die top of the wall. Lit by 
the numerous floodlights concen- 
trated on him, he had the appear- 
ance of a drab moth caught in a 
porch -light. How he’d managed to 
climb as high as he had was a 
mirade. The wails of the prison 
were solid concrete, smooth, slick- 
ened by years of moisture and slime 
the only handholds were the small 
cracks where the concrete had 
cracked. His face was twisted in 
agony, his eyes glared out as though 
they refused to see what was hap- 
pening. 

A circle of guards appeared be- 
neath him, rifles aimed in his direc- 
tion. 

“Hold your fire,” the warden 
shouted. “I want him alive, if possi- 
ble! Frelon, I order you to come 
down.” 

“I’ll bring him down,” The guard 
that said that raised his lifle to 
his shoulder. 

The warden rushed furiously at 
the guard. “You’ll follow orders! 
Understand me?” 

The rifle was lowered. 

Again the warden shouted to Fre- 
lon, “Come down now and I prom- 
ise you, no harm will come to you. 
Do you hear me?” 

Frelon’s hand’s clawed at the wall, 
seddng fresh holds. For a minute 
it looked as if he would fall. 

“Listen, Frelon! I’^ll make a deal 
with you. Tell me how you got 



ON THE 'SHALLOW SEAS

over the floor without getting 
knocked unconsdous, and 1 give you 
my word nothii^ will happen to 
you.” 

Frelon’s hands reached for a new 
hold. His feet kicked at the wall 
trying to find some new crack to 
press into. 

“Frelon!” the warden shouted. 

Frelon pulled himself up another 
inch. 

“Bring him downl” the warden 
screamed at last. Almost ibefore the 
command left his mouth, the zzzzsst 
of the stun guns sang out. 

Frelon seemed to float there for- 
ever. Then slowly, slowly, his body 
arched back. 

Lant’s gasp was lost in the thud 
of Frelon’s body striking in die 
yard outside. 

V 

L ant rested for a few minutes. 

All morning he hadn? found a 
single oyster. His cans stood empty 
against the rails on the crawler. 

The spot he’d picked to look was 
called Big Break. Ihe name had 
nothing to do with the prison. When 
the big rush was on to find gold 
on Exonan, the people had re- 
claimed miles of the land from the 
sea. 

Just a few years before the 
prison had been built, Exonan had 
suffered a terrible earthquake. The 
high, thick levees holding back the 
sea held all except in one place. 
But what a place! For two miles, 
the levee crumbled and the sea 
had poured back in, leaving all the 
reclaimed area flooded with from 



five to ten feet of water. Because 
of the break in the levee it had came 
. to be called Big iBreak. 

Rising Lant stretched. The warm 
sun felt good. He would have liked 
to enjoy it forever, but he had to 
get going or he’d go hungry to- 
night. Easing over the side, he 
dropped back into the water. 

The bottom was very muddy 
there with the kind of mud that 
clung to the bottom of his feet like 
glue. His prograss was terribly slow. 
Besides the bottom, he had to con- 
tend with the numerous pieces of 
rook that had once formed the levee 
walls. Each time his foot touched 
one of these chunks he would have 
to check it out before he was sure 
what he had touched — oyster, 
rook or cannibal oyster! 

He continued to circle the crawler, 
sliding one foot along before the 
other. Lant circled until he was forty 
or fifty feet from the crawler. He 
had all but decided to give up and 
move to some other area, when his 
right foot brushed something. 

“Carefully he ran his foot along 
it until he located the hump. Slowly 
Lant counted the horns. One, two, 
three, four, five — six! He froze. 
He now had his foot on what he 
knew was the bait a cannibal oyster 
used to lure its prey over its huge 
mouth with. Lant realized at that 
very moment he was being sensed. 
The instant he made any movement, 
either toward it or away, it would 
strike like fanged lightning! 

A cannibal oyster looked a lot 
like an old-^fashioned bear trap. The 
trap was its huge mouth. Sticking 
out from the mouth was a long

tongue, the end of which formed 
a perfect copy of an oyster, with 
the small exception of having six 
horns instead of five. Once its prey 
was lured over the bait, it would 
rise up from the muddy bottom like 
a freight train. 

Laying buried in the mud, its body 
looked like a huge earthworm. The 
cannibal had no eyes, but its senses 
of vibration were highly developed. 

Lant had seen one convict killed 
by one. Now he was in danger of be- 
coming a meal himselfl 

Without moving a muscle, hardly 
breathing, he stood there until his 
nerves settled down. Don’t panic, 
he told himself. Then slowly, ever 
so slowly, he moved his hand, an 
inch at a time, down until he got 
a firm grip on his oyster blade. A 
little at a time, he carefully pulled 
it from his belt. 

While doing this, he figured out 
where the cannibal oyster’s body 
must be lying. After what seemed 
like hours, expecting those terrible 
jaws to engulf him every second, 
he raised the blade high over his 
bead. 

Lant quickly stomped down on 
the cannibal’s bait; at the same time 
he drove the oyster blade down with 
all his strength in the direction he 
hoped the cannibal would come 
from. 

The jaws rose out of the water 
over him. His blade sank deep into 
the cannibal’s body! 

The jaws gnash^ in air, missing 
him by only inches. Lant kept shov- 
ing his blade in, turning it, and at 
the same time jerking it from right 
to left. The cannibal rose to the 



top of the water and tossed him 
aside. 

Quickly Lant scrambled aboard 
the crawler. The cannibal lay atop 
the water. Wood gushing from the 
rent on its side. Its huge body 
thrashing back and forth, its blood 
foaming the water. 

When it finally lay still, Lant lay 
flat in the boat, content to drift. 
Content to be alive. 

H ours later, he roused himself. 

The length of the shadow his 
crawler cast on the water told him 
his time was running out. 

lliere was no sense just sitting 
around, worrying. Lant strapped his 
oyster blade around his waist and 
entered die water. It seemed warm- 
er than usual; almost immediately, 
he started to sweat. 

He had only circled the crawler 
three or four times when he found 
his first oyster. 

When he had it on the deck of 
the crawler, Lant figured it weighed 
at least ninety poimds. Using an 
oar as a hammer, he worked the 
blade in between the two halves. 

The meat from it filled all his 
cans; at least he could be sure of 
eating tonight. The meat out of 
the way, he poked his finger into 
the holes long the hinge. Nothing. 
He went to the next one. Nothing, 
nothing. He went to the next hole. 
Nothing — wait. 

That didn’t feel quite right. 
Sticking his ^ger back into the last 
hole, he felt slowly around the sides. 
There was sometUmg there aM ri^t. 
It felt like a small maible, more 
like a pea. Lant moved the object 



ON THE SHALLOW SEAS 



111 




around until he was able to get his 
finger crooked behind it. Then, 
keeping constant pr6ss>ure on it, he 
worked it out of the hole. 

Wiping the green scum from it, 
he held it up to the light. When he 
finally stopped laughing, he could 
have cried. Over five years he had 
been looking for an oyster with a 
pearl in it. Now he finally found 
one, and it was the size of a pea! 
A very small pea at that. For an 
instant, he was tempted to throw 
it back. Hold on now, he thought, 
you can still trade it for something, 
it must have some value. Even an 
ounce of gold was worth a for- 
tune. 

The rest of the day yielded one 
more oyster almost as large as the 
first had been, and it too contained 
a pearl, so small it looked like a 
grain of rice. 

Lant was beside himself with pity. 
After five years, to find two pearls 
in one day — and to have them 
tiny! Lant knew that neither of them 
would free him. He cursed his luck. 

W hen Lant arrived at the prison 
that night, he skipped sup- 
per and went to the warden’s of- 
fice. He told the duty guard that 
he had to see the warden but re- 
fused to tell him why. Bored, the 
guard told him to wait. 

The warden was in his sixties. 
His hair had long ago retreated to 
the sides of his head. He was a short 
man, and an ugly one. 

Lant stopped the correct four 
paces from the desk and made the 
proper salute, right hand flung across 
his chest. "'Number 4672 requests 



that the warden will receive him.” 

“Request granted. State your busi- 
ness, my time is important.” 

Lant reached into his pocket to 
get the pearls out. The right hand 
of the warden flew up. From out 
of nowhere a stun pistol appeared 
in his hand. 

“Don’t move a mjuscle, 4672, or 
you’re dead!” 

Lant realized he’d made a serious 
mistake. “I’m only trying to get 
two pearls out to ^ow you.” 

“Don’t take me for a fool, 4672. 
You couldn’t possibly have one pearl 
in your pocket, let alone two.” 

Lant grinned, “What if they were 
both the size of peas?” Lant could 
tell the warden was thinking it 
over, his eyes had a bad habit of 
giving his thoughts away. 

Finally the warden spK>ke. “All 
right, 4672, take your hand out, 
but slowly. This pistol’s set on 
lethal charge.” 

Lant eased the pearls from his 
pocket, stepped forward, laid the 
pearls on the desk and stepped 
back. The warden picked the pearls 
up and studied them closely. Still 
holding them, he said, “You don’t 
expect to get a pardon for these 
small pearls, do you?” 

“No,” Lant replied. 

“Then what do you expect for 
them?” 

“Warden, all I want for them is 
for you to give me permission to 
have a larger gas tank installed on 
my crawler.” 

“What for?” The warden eyed 
distrustfully. 

“I think I know where to find 
oysters with gold pearls in them. 



112 



IF 




VI 



But I liave to go faither from the 
prison.” 

“Where?” the warden demanded. 

Lant smiled — inside, so it 
wouldn’t show on has face. “If I 
told you, you’d go look for your- 
self.” 

“Don’t get smart with me 4672, 
I could make things mi^ty tough 
for you.” 

Lant replied quickly, his temper 
beginning to rise. *"And 1 could 
write the prison commission about 
the two pearls I just gave you. 
Look, Warden. Ail I ask for is a 
larger gas tank on my crawler. 
Nothing more.” 

The warden rolled the pearls 
continually around in his hand, deep 
in thought. 

“I’ll see,” he said at last. “Prison- 
er is dismissed.” 

It wouldn’t do no good to force 
the issue. Lant returned to the cell 
blodc. For the first time since he’d 
arrived there, he had no trouble 
falling asleep. 

And at the gate the next morn- 
ing he was stopped by one of the 
guards. “See that crawler, number 
eight? Orders from the warden. To- 
day you take that one.” 

Lant checked the crawler over 
carefully. He feared the warden 
might try to arrange an accident, 
to get rid of him. His fears vanished, 
when he noticed the crawler had a 
larger gas tank welded on it. 

At the gates, no cme acted like 
they even noticed the change. The 
guards ignored the larger gas tank 
completely. After the usual speech, 
the returner was bolted on and he 
was waved out. 



O nce dear of die prison and as 
soon as he was sure he wasn’t 
being followed, Lant let the crawler 
idle. 

When he had marked x’s on his 
map yesterday for the two pearis 
he’d found, he noticed something 
he’d never noticed hefore. 

The x’s for tiie pearis he’d found 
and the x’s for the pearls othm 
had foimd, formed a perfectiy 
straight line. The line ran straight 
to a small bay, on the tip of a vol- 
canic island. AH the way back to 
the prison Lant had thougM about it. 
It was to unHkdy to be just coinci- 
dence. No one from the prison ever 
looked there. They coddn’t; the 
island was too far from the prison 
for the amount of gas a crawler 
normally carried. By the time he’d 
arrived at the prison, he had made 
up his mind to exchange the little 
pearls for a larger gas tank. 

His map indicated that the vol- 
cano on the island, though active, 
hadn’t erupted since the planet was 
discovered. Lant hoped the oys- 
ters with gold pearls had came from 
there. 

It was almost noon when the 
volcano came into sight. The island 
ft sat on was blackened from one 
end to the other. A dirty column 
of black smoke hung from the top 
of the volcano, the only indication it 
was active at all. As Lant drew 
closer, the unmistakable odor of 
sulphur filled his nose. He hoped 
the volcano wouldn’t choose today 
to become active. 

The water was almost too hot to

enter. Lant eased himself in, grad- 
ually letting his body get accustom- 
ed to it. It wasn’t very deep; his 
feet hit the bottom before he was 
wet to his waist. 

Sliding his feet along, first one, 
then the other, he circled his craw- 
ler. He hadn’t gone ten steps be- 
fore he found the first one. 

Cautiously he ran his foot across 
the oyster until he found the horns. 
One, two, three, four — five, just 
five. Lant dove. 

T wo hours later and as many 
oysters, he still hadn’t found 
one with a pearl in it. The meat 
cans stood full against the rail. With 
meat to spare, Lant took a break, 
ate and enjoyed for just a moment 
the quiet of the day. 

The x’s on the map were not 
sheer chance. He spread the map 
out on the crawler’s deck: They 
ran straight as an arrow, straight 
to a small bay on the tip of the 
island. That was it, the bay, four 
or five miles north of where he was! 

The bay was harder to locate than 
the map showed. The coast on this 
side of the island was nothing but 
sheer cliffs. Lant almost passed the 
entrance. Recent slides had almost 
closed it off from the sea. 

The passage in was narrow; he 
was forced to weave constantly, to 
avoid the jagged ends of rocks jut- 
ting up from beneath the water. 
Sheltered by sheer cliffs on all sides, 
the bay was almost impossible to 
see. A fluffy gray fog hung over 
the water, and it was quiet. Even 
the normal, sounds were missing. 
Lant anchored the boat in the 



center of the bay. The water was 
very hot there. He would only be 
a;ble to stay in it for short periods 
of time. 

He was back onto the crawler in 
a flash! He’d dropped right on top 
of an oyster. Of course, it was pos- 
sible, but it had startled him. It 
wasn’t a cannibal or he’d have been 
a meal by then. 

He entered the water again off 
to one side of the oyster; slipped 
his foot along until he found it, 
counted the horns to be sure. Just 
a plain oyster. 

But it was not just a plain oyster. 
When he pulled it aboard he found 
the pearl. 

He was overjoyed! He danced 
crazily around the deck — shouted 
— laughed — cried. It was the 
most beautiful thing he’d even seen. 
He held it up to the light. Even 
through the green slime he could 
see the shine of gold. What a pearl, 
he thought. By far the largest pearl 
anyone had ever found. Lant was 
willing to bet it weighed three 
pounds. Wiping the scum from it, 
he held it up to the dim light. 
Freedom, that’s what he held. Free- 
dom! 

Lant’s first impulse was to rush 
back to the prison. He could just 
picture himself standing there, beW- 
ing with joy. All the other prisoners 
at his feet. Proudly answering their 
questions. He felt so happy. Finally, 
out of ibreath, he stopped cavorting 
around. 

Lant eased himself back into the 
water. When he stopped it was only 
because the deck of the crawler was 
covered with oysters to the point 



114 



IF 





ON THE SHAUOW SEAS 



115 






it was in dang^ of sinking — and 
all had pearls! Others had found 
the pickings, he’d found the mother 
lode! 

The alarm went off on the re- 
turner. Laughing, Lant took his oys- 
ter blade and chopped through the 
metal case protecting it. He tore 
firing from the returner unta he 
was sure it could no longer con- 
trol the crawler. 

Today, he would go back on his 
own. 

L ant stood looking out the win- 
dow, at the lovely, watery, 
landscape. His wife was busy, show- 



ing friends their beautiful home. He 
could hear parts of their conversa- 
tion. 

Carol was speaking at the mo- 
ment. “You see, since Lant found so 
much gold, the courts decided that 
legally the extra gold was his.** 
Card joined Lant, it was a lovely 
view. 

“So you sec,” she went on, ‘Vhen 
Lant heard they were closing the 
prison down here ^ on Exonan, he 
bought it. Of course, it took a 
lot of remodeling.” 

They ail went out onto the patio. 

“You’re right,” Card said. “It 
does make a lovely home.” END

THE 

IMPERSONATORS 

by C. C. MacAPP 



Kruger had no difficulty locating the 
criminal he had pursued across space. 
Trouble was he found too many of him! 



T he meal had been like most ban- 
quet meals, and the several men 
at the speakers’ table on the plat- 
form looked — one of them ex- 
cepted — ordinary. The exception 
was a tanned, blocky man of perhaps 
thirty-five, dressed in a dark blue 
suit, with a white shirt and a black 
string necktie. His cropped black 
hair stood up like a shoe brush, and 
his eyebrows (beetled now) were 
heavy, almost meeting above his 
nose. He had the kind of jowls that 
always looked as if they needed a 
shave. His wide mouth was clamped 
in a straight line. Not extraordinary? 
No — but there was a patch of ad- 
hesive tape on his forehead, scratch- 



es on both cheeks and a puffiness 
around one glaring eye. Make-up 
failed to hide bruises here and there. 

The master-of-ceremonies was al- 
ready warmed up: 

“ — that the Interstellar Division 
always gets its man. Of course, that 
isn’t invariably true. Space is a fair- 
ly big territory, ha ha, and now and 
then one does get away. But the 
man who is about to receive the 
year’s Surprise Award is an officer 
who, so far, has never failed to get 
his man. Except, of course, when 
he was chasing — excuse me, I 
mean, ha ha, apprehending — wom- 
en.” The me paused to pick up a 
large plaque that lay on the table. 



117 




He took two steps and extended it 
toward tihe scowling, battered man. 
“And now, I take great pleasure in 
awarding — 

The blocky man’s scowl deepened. 
Suddenly he was on his feet. He 
snarled something to the me, turned, 
clumped to the edge of the platform 
and off it, and marched toward an 
exit. The me looked startled, turned 
crimson and glanced involuntarily 
at the plaque as if he’d just been 
told to swallow it whole, or some- 
thing. 

After a few moments the me col- 
lected himself a little and raised the 
mike to his lips. “Uh, friends. I’m, 
uh, sorry to have to report that In- 
spector Kruger has just had a sudden 
attack of, er, indigestion. But . 
well • . anyway, there was this 
mature, respected accountant who 
got away with a million and a half 
credits, and we traced him to a 
pJanet called Phrodd. It’s about 
eighty-two light-years away, and no 
Terran spaceline services it, so it 
has to be readied by transferring 
twice on Alien lines. Well, uh. In- 
spector Kruger went to Phrodd and 
made the arrest. His official report 
has, er, not yet been released, but we 
understand there were grave difficul- 
ties of an unusual nature . 

I t was Inspector Judson Kruger’s 
first day on Phrodd. He turned, 
caught sight of something, hesitated, 
then bellowed in a stern voice tinged 
with hysteria, “Stand, in the name 
of the Government of Earth!” 

Agile despite his large feet, he 
hopped across a twelve-foot-long 
slug (which cried out in fright and 



jerked in its eyes talks) and seized 
the arm of a mature, courtly, very 
tall man with a broad fore- 
head and a splendid crop of silvery 
hair. “Borogrove O’Lardi,” Kruger 
snapped, “I arrest you for the crime 
of embezzlement!” 

The man turned innocent, mildly 
reproachful blue eyes upon him for 
a moment before beginning to melt to 
one of the native slugs — or Whugs, 
as they were called. 

Kruger jerked his hand away 
from the rapidly indrawing arm. 
“Damn it,” he said shakily, “you’re 
the sixth one today!” 

The Whug finished its metamor- 
phosis, in careful stages so it didn’t 
fall hard to the pavement, then ex- 
tended its eyestalks toward Kruger 
and said, in a voice that undoubtedly 
matched O’Larch’s fairly well, “I’m, 
wh, sorry, Earthman. I was paid to 
do this impersonation. Tliank you 
for, wh, terminating it.” The eye- 
stalks swiveled, and the native crawl- 
ed away. 

Kruger strode down the sidewalk, 
muttering to himself, dodging or 
stepping over or ducking under a 
dozen different species of visitors 
to the planet, plus whatever Whugs 
had business here in Phrodd’s In- 
terstellar Settlement. Halfway to his 
hotel, he saw another O’Larch. He 
almost passed it up, but finally 
steeled himself to try again. “Stand, 
Borogrove O’Larch!” 

The routine was the same. The 
Whug gratefully assumed its own 
shape and said, “My, wh, apologies, 
Earthman. I was, wh, paid — ” 

Kruger snarled, “Go to, wh, hell,” 
and walked away. 



118 



IV 




H e hadn’t been able to get his 
standard communicator work- 
ing right, so in his hotel room he 
lay prone on the floor and growled 
in to the Whug-level phone-grill, 
“English!” 

There were various clicks and 
murmurs, then a voice said, “Eng- 
lish, wh, spoken.” 

“Yeah. Get me Earth, please. The 
hookup has to go via Moog. I want 
the Terran Department of Justice, 
Interstellar Division, Commissioner 
Stanzlecz.” 

“Commissioner, who, wh, sir?” 
“Stanzlecz! S, T — oh, hell; just 
put through the call. I’ll talk to who- 
ever answers.” 

The connection only took five 
minutes, there being very little time- 
lag in the subether. A girlish voice 
lisped. “Interj/e/iar Division!” 
“Who’s this?” Kruger demanded. 
“Penny Uddersmith. I’m new 
here.” 

“Oh. Uh, Penny, this is Inspector 
Judson Kruger. \^at are you — I 
mean, put me through to the Chief, 
will you?” 

A moment later Stanzlecz’s voice 
said querulously, “Yes? Is that you, 
Kruger? Whatever are you doing on 
Moog?” 

“I’m not on Moog,” Kruger told 
him, trying to keep his voice level, 
“the call just has to go through 
there. Chief, O’Larch is here on 
Phrodd, all right, but there’s a com- 
plication. You see, the natives here 
— ” Kruger rolled over to relieve a 
kink in his back, and banged his 
ear into a chair leg. “Ow, danm it! 
The Whugs, that’s the dominant 
race, can take any shape they want 



to, and O’Larch has hired a bunch 
to impersonate him. Since 1 arrived 
he’s increased the number, and 
I spend all my time trying to arrest 
them. He’s got quite a bit of loot to 
work with, you know.” 

There was a silence, then, “Kru- 
ger, you promised me faithfully you 
woul^’t drink on the job any 
more!” 

“I’M NOT DRUNK!” Kruger 
roared. He put his hand over the 
phone-grill and spoke to hims elf in 
monosyllables for a moment, then re- 
sumed the subether conversation. 
“You can look it up in the encyclo- 
pedias; they’re the best mimics ever 
found. Not too advanced in other 
ways, though. Although they’re in- 
telligent enough. Anyway — ” 

“Gracious,” Stanzlecz interrupted, 
“whatever in the world good does 
that do him?” 

Kruger clamped his lips for a mo- 
ment. “They keep walking about the 
Settlement, and while I’m busy try- 
ing to arrest them, O’Larch has an 
easy time staying out of my way. 
And of course inquiries do no good. 
Who knows whether he’s seen the 
real O’Larch or not? One thing, 
though. At least he’s confined to the 
Settlement. So are all other aliens — 
except me, of course; I have special 
privileges. The Moogs enforce that 
rule — this is a Moog protectorate, 
you know — and they’ve promised 
not to let O’Larch leave the planet 
until I find him.” 

Stanzlecz said, “Won’t they help 
you apprehend him? Or how about 
the natives? Those, uh, Whugs . .” 

“No, no, no. There are treaties, 
and protocols, and codes of honor. 



THE IMPERSONATORS 



119 




and every damned tiling you ever 
heard of. What I called you about, 
is I need a bigger allowance for this 
}ob. I’ve got the idea of hiring some 
Whugs myself, to impersonate me. 
They can go aroimd arresting 
OT/krches, which will use them up a 
lot faster than I can do it alone. 
You see, the contract they make, as 
near as I can figure it out, is to 
maintain the impersonation imtil 
they’re arrested, or xmtil a day and 
night have passed. They can’t hold 
it indefinitely. They have to resume 
their own shapes to eat or sleep. So 
if I can hire some help . Also, 
O’Larch won’t know which is the 
real me, and it’ll be hard for him to 
keep dodging all of us. I might get 
lucky and comer him. But, as I 
said, I need credits.” 

There was a pause, then a sigh, 
and, “Oh, fiddlesticks. I’d hoped to 
keep the budget down on this one. 
Well, if you must, you must. I’ll al- 
low you a hundred fifty thousand 
credits total. Mind you, your pas- 
sage and sustenance, and any of 
that fooling around you do, will have 
to come out of it.” 

Kruger stared at the phone-grill 
in disbeilief. “O’Larch has ten times 
that to work with!” 

Stanziecz turned petulant. “Well, 
Earth has to show a profit on his 
apprehension, doesn’t we? I mean, 
don’t it? Uh — no, not another 
word of argument! That’s the limit, 
and that’s it. And one other thing. 
Earth has very good relations with 
Moog. Don’t you do anything — 
anything, do you hear? — to get the 
Moogs peeved at you!” 

Kruger lay there, counting the 



pulse that throbbed inside his skulL 
Finally he said, “Yes, Qiief,” and 
broke the connection. 

liiT ummumnoonoogog, the Moo* 
IVA gan Governor of Phrodd, was 
biped and more or less humanoid — 
which body-shape might have some- 
thing to do with the reasonably co- 
operative relations between Earth 
and the Moogan Empire — but he 
looked like a humanoid bred many 
generations for barehanded physical 
combat. He must have weighed twice 
what Kruger did, and he had vicious 
teeth, too. 

However, his eyes were placidly 
sfhrewd and his manners civilized, 
and he wasn’t much hairier than 
Kruger, and he didn’t have any de- 
tectable odor. His neat uniform 
showed the rippling of his huge 
muscles as he closed >die office door 
and walked to his own wide chair 
behind a big desk. “I’m happy to 
have this chance to meet you in 
person, Kruger. I happen to have 
been a cop, as the slang has it, my- 
self, in my younger days. Sorry I 
can’t give you more direct help; I’ve 
little sympathy for criminals. How- 
ever, treaties and such, you know. 
Well. You want to find an entre- 
preneur, eh, who’ll contract for a 
number of impersonators? Damned 
good mimics, these Whugs. Daren’t 
let any of them off the planet — 
you’ll have to be X-rayed yourself 
when you leave, to make sure you’re 
genuine. You think you want about 
fifty, who speak English? I’ll put 
you in touch with a reliable Whug 
businessman who can handle that. 



120 



IF 




But I can tell you — this is off the 
record; I can’t show open partiality 
— that O’Larch has a hundred im- 
personators going, and a hundred 
more English-speaking Whugs, at 
least, on retainers. Pretty well cor- 
nered most of the supply, I’m afraid. 
Of course, if you only want yours to 
speak one or two standard phrases, 
they can learn those in a matter of 
minutes. Damned fine linguists. I’d 
think you’d want as many impersona- 
tions as O’Larch has, if not more, 
to wear him down.” 

Kruger said, “Yeah, but I’m on a 
limited budget. Another thing I 
wanted to ask you about — why 
can’t my impersonators, if I get 
them, make more than one arrest 
apiece? I’ve made a few inquiries, 
and it seems they insist they’ll have 
to revert when they make one ar- 
rest.” 

Mum — as he’d graciously told 
Kruger to call him — spre^ his 
hands and smiled. “Union rules.” 

“Oh,” Kruger said. “Well, ... if 
it isn’t against Moogan policy, could 
I maybe find some non-union Whugs 
who’d make more than one arrest 
apiece?” 

Mum pursed his big lips. “N-no, I 
doubt it. Of course, there are the 
Gnigs . But, no.” 

“Grugs?” Kruger asked hopefully. 

“Forget them!” For a moment. 
Mum’s eyes bored keenly into 
Kruger, then he relaxed. “The 
Grugs are just as good mimics as the 
Whugs, but they’re barred from the 
Settlement. From this whole area, in 
fact. You see, the Whugs evolved 
the ability to imitate as a defensive 
thing. They’re plant-eaters and not 



vicious by nature — though they 
can be tough, when they have to. 
The Grugs were predators, who used 
the imitation to ambush their prey. 
The two races are like — weU, like 
cats and dogs, you might say, though 
the analogy isn’t perfect. But as I 
said, Grugs are out of the question.” 
l6u;ger sighed. “Well, I guess I’ll 
try it with what Whugs I can afford, 
then. By the way, how is it so many 
of them speak English? And you, 
too. Your whole staff speaks it like 
bom Terrans!” 

Mum said, “Actually, I doubt if 
you realize how far English has 
spread through the galaxy. Races 
wbo’ve never been within a hun- 
dred light-years of a human speak 
it. It has certain, shall I say, vir- 
tues? I myself speak over two hun- 
dred fifty languages fluently, and I 
can get along in several thousand. 
But frankly, I’ve never encountered 
a language that lent itself so aptly as 
English to — well, obfuscation, 
where obfuscation’s needed.” 

“Oh,” Kruger said, “yeah. Well, 
may I have the name of that Whug 
businessman?” 

K ruger saw the businessman and 
contracted for twenty-five im- 
personations to be made on a single 
day later in the week. He made no 
commitments about the additional 
twenty-five, except to get an assur- 
ance that they could be supplied if 
needed. He wanted to do a little 
thinking while he still had credits 
left. 

He extracted a promise of secrecy 
(except within the union, of course) 
and made a date to return the next

day, when the impersonators were 
gathered, so they could observe him. 
Then he went back to his hotel room, 
took off his shoes, and arranged 
himself on the bed with his feet ele- 
vated in a sling evidently provided 
for some odd-shaped alien species. 

He’d already canvassed the ho- 
tels of the Settlement and found 
sixty-odd Borogrove O’Larches regis- 
ter^. The others were probably 
staying at rooming houses, or just 
wandering the streets. No doubt 
O’Laroh had other Whugs, or aliens, 
hired to keep watch on Kruger. So 
there wasn’t much chance, single- 
handed, of finding the embezzler 
even by blind luck. But with a 
whole company of Krugers suddenly 
on the scene, the watchers would be 
confused. And so would O’Larch. 

The trouble was, the fake Kru- 
gers wouldn’t report O’Larch even 
if they found him. Union rules, and 
things, again. Which left the odds 
still heavily against Kruger. He’d 
just have to pick the most likely in- 
tersection, and watch as many ar- 
rests as possible. 

What he really needed was im- 
personators who’d actually make ar- 
rests and keep — or at least trail — 
the real O’Larch if they found him. 
Also, he needed hirelings who 
wouldn’t revert after a single at- 
tempt. 

In short, he needed Grugs. 

Did he dare? One thing would be 
on his side. Once in the Settlement, 
the Grugs wouldn’t reveal them- 
selves. The penalties they risked were 
too severe for that. But suppose one 
of them lost his wits, or got knocked 
unconscious, or something? Of 



course, there’d only be twenty-five 
of them, and they could be warned, 
and the O’Larches — even the real 
one — weren’t likely to offer vio- 
lence. 

Still, did he dare? 

Often before, facing difficult de- 
cisions like this, he’d found it help- 
ful to turn the problem around and 
look at it from die other end. He 
did so now. Did he dare not to? 

No. 

W ith that settled, he pondered 
how to make contact secretly 
with the Grugs. He glanced at his 
watdi. There was a certain Whug 
bartender in die hotel’s lounge, whom 
Kruger’s practiced eye had observed 
from time to time in clandestine con- 
versation with various kinds of 
aliens. The Whug wasn’t due on duty 
for a while, but Kruger could kill 
the time over dinner. 

He showered, shaved again, dress- 
ed leisurely, went down to the din- 
ing room, pored over the epicurean 
items on the menu and ordered. 

Dinner finished he sauntered in- 
to the bar, located the bartender he 
wanted, pulled up a stool, got out his 
wallet, and placed two ten-credit 
notes on the bar. "I want,” he said 
quietly, “to be put in touch with the 
most despicable, most unprincipled, 
most traitorious Whug within two 
hundred miles.” 

The bartender’s eyestalks spread 
hastily right and left, making sure 
no one was watching or listening. 
Then they both bent toward one end 
of the bar, where three enlisted 
Moogs were getting drunk and be- 
ginning to be disorderly, swiveled

to scan a pair of giant centipedes 
twisting together and giggling in a 
booth, and finally returned to Kru- 
ger. One twitched briefly in the di- 
rection of Kruger’s still-fat waUet. 
The bartender elongated himself a 
little closer. “Wh, Earthman,” he 
whispered, ‘7 am that Whug.” 

T he country a hundred miles east 
of the Settlement was rougher, 
its rocky valleys choked with gnarled, 
vine-entrangl^ trees. Kruger, stum- 
bling on the path, steadied himself 
against a big boulder. 

There was a smear of motion. 
Within seconds, the boulder had be- 
come a beast like an enormous scaley 
bulldog with a crocodile’s head. 
“Watch it, you, gr, Terran slob,” the 
creature growled. 

“Oh,” Kruger said, taking a hasty 
step backward, “sorry. My name’s 
Kruger. I was looking for — ” 

The Grug snarled an obscenity. 
“You’ve found him. Put your, ^r, 
money where your mouth is.” 

“Yeah,” Kruger said, “right. I’ll 
pay ten per cent over the Whug 
union scale. But your twenty-five 
impersonators have got to keep 
working the full night and day, if 
necessary. And they’ve got to be 
careful.” 

The Grug rumbled with scorn. 
“Only ten per cent over what a Whug 
gets? Know any other new, gr, 
jokes?” 

‘Twenty per cent,” Kruger said 
firmly, “and that’s all I can spend. 
Take it or leave it.” 

“Okay, I’ll take it. What’s the, 
gr, goddam job?” 

Kruger explained. Tbe Grug en- 



trepreneur pondered. “Gr. Yeah, I 
see what you mean. I don’t know; 
big, gr, risk, going into the Settle- 
ment. Those Moogs don’t mess 
aroimd. Still, I can probably find 
volunteers; it sounds like fun. Gr, 
yeahl We can sneak in imitating 
Whugs! Do you want me to draw up 
a contract, or shall we just, gr, shake 
hands on it?” 

“Nuts,” Kruger said. “I’ve located 
a bond broker we can both rely on. 
I’ll put up the money with him. 
And you and I will work out de- 
tails ^at are desirable for both of 
us. Not that I don’t trust you. Just 
a matter of principle, you under- 
stand.” 

The crocodilian mouth gaped in 
an awful grin. “Earthman, I, gr, be- 
gin to like you!” 

I t was unnerving when the first 
Whug impersonators began scat- 
trang about the settlement. One 
strode up to Kruger and snapped, 
almost in Kruger’s own voice, 
“Your, wh, necktie’s not quite right. 
The boss’ll dock you if he sees that!” 
Kruger scowl^. “My tie’s right, 
damn it. Yours is too wide!” 

The fake’s eyes widened. “Oh! 
You’re the real — ” His tie narrowed 
a trifle. (God, Kruger thought, even 
the fabric looks genuine) . “Wh, 
sorry, sir.” The impostor turned 
and clumped on. Halfway down the 
block it bellowed, “Stand, Boro- 
grove O’Larch!” and seized the arm 
of a victim. Both of them began to 
melt into Whugs. When they’d fin- 
ished, they crawled away side by 
side. Kruger winced. 

He moved on back to the corner 



THE IMPERSONATORS 



123 




where he could watch the cross- 
street. An O’Larch was moving 
leisurely toward a modest hotel. 
Krug^ tensed. Was that, possibly, 
the real one going to cover? Should 
he follow? 

A bellow of, “Standi” from be- 
hind him made him turn. He watch- 
ed an arrest and double reversion, 
the two Whugs again crawling off 
side-by-side in -the direction of the 
union hall. From somewhere — in 
the next street, he thought — came 
a shout of, “Stand!” He raced in 
that direction, swerving around 
aliens who whistled or grunted and 
turned to stare after him. He also 
had to hurdle a lot of Whugs — 
there seemed to be an unusual num- 
ber about today. He reached the 
far comer in time to see another ar- 
rest-and-double-reversion. 

Three gone, damn it! He wondered 
if there might have been others, in- 
side hoteh where he couldn’t hear 
them. He doubted it. He thought 
the real O’Lardh — at least, in this 
first shock of confusion — would 
still be out in the streets, where he 
could move around. Scowling, he 
trotted back to the main intersec- 
tion. He needed about a dozen assis- 
tants scattered about the Settlement, 
that’s what he needed. Muttering 
under his breath about the Chiefs 
stinginess, he turned this way and 
that, eyes busy. 

An O’Larch emerged from a cof- 
fee shop and ambled in his direction. 
He started that way, but a Kruger 
burst from a dooiway and got there 
first. “Stand, Borogrove O’Larch, in 
the, gr, name of the Government of 
Earth!” 



Kruger grunted with satisfaction. 
The Grugs were beginnmg to operate. 
He watched the O’Larch turn into 
a Whug, point his eyestalks at the 
steadfast fake Kruger, do a double- 
take, hitch about uncertainly for a 
moment, say something, get no re- 
ply, shrug, and crawl away alone, 
looking thoughtful. The Grug-Kruger 
(whose voice had been a trifle har- 
sher than necessary) caught sight of 
Kruger, took a quick step toward 
him, stopped, crouched for an in- 
stant in indecision, then turned 
away. 

K ruger made sure there were no 
more O’Larches in sight, then 
hurried along the main street to the 
next intersection. There were two or 
three hotels in the side street he 
wanted to watch. 

It was beginning to become clear 
to him that, before the Grugs had 
used up all the fake O’Larches, he, 
Kruger, was going to be a very tired 
^d very distracted man. And there 
was one thing he hadn’t thought 
about. The way he was acting, any- 
one interested could see he was the 
real policeman. He’d have to go 
more slowly, making arrests of his 
own. 

He turned the corner and stopped, 
confronted with a new facet. Six — 
no less — O’Larches were emerging 
from what looked like a vacant store, 
and scattering in different directions. 
Reinforcements, damn it! 

An alien like a squat, very broad 
Terran bull with delicate branched 
antennae in place of horns was 
standing across the street, staring at 
the dispersing O’Larches. Even an 



124 



IF 




alien could hardly help noticing the 
identity, seeing them all together 
like this. 

A Kruger darted around -the far 
corner and hurled himself upon the 
nearest O’Larch, almost knocking 
him down. “Gr, stand!” He fairly 
dragged his victim toward die next 
O’Larch, who stood bewildered. 
“Stand!” The fake Kruger seized 
the second O’Larch with his other 
hand, giving him a little shake in the 
bargain. 

“Hey,” the victim remonstrated, 
“what the — I mean, I beg your par- 
don, officer, I do not — oh, hell!” 
He began to melt to a Whug, as the 
other arrestee was doing. 

The fake Kruger snarled in a not 
very human way, let go of them, and 
galloped toward another victim, 
shoving, as he went by, a vicious 
stiff-arm into the bull-alien’s face. 
“One side, tubby!” He grabbed an 
O’Larch. This time, the Whug, be- 
fore reverting, swung an awkward 
fist and chirped something in Whug. 
The Kruger knocked him down. 
“Don’t get funny with me, you slug! 
Stand!” 

The remaining three O’Larches 
ran toward the spot, - shouting, 
“Scab! Unfair!” and such things. The 
two who had reverted were now 
humping themselves back toward the 
ruckus, making astonishing speed. 
Kruger ran toward the spot, yelling, 
“Hey! You! Copper! You’re not sup- 
posed to — ” 

Four more Krugers came around 
the comer, saw the disturbance, and 
galloped toward it, roaring. A Whug 
onlooker whipped his tail in front of 
them, tripping two, who went down 



bellowing obscenities. One started to 
waver out of shape, remembered 
where he was and hastily re-Kni- 
gered himself. But the Whug who’d 
tripped him had seen. 

“Grugs!” he screamed, battering 
at the fake with his tail. Windows 
were going up in the hotels all along 
the street now, and a fantastic varie- 
ty of heads popped out to look. 
Aliens began pouring from the lob- 
bies, tripping over each other and 
shrieking and bellowing and adding 
to the bedlam. A Whug Kruger 
hadn’t noticed tripped him. 

“Damn it,” Kruger yelled “I’m 
— Then he had to roll hastily to 
avoid the bludgeoning tail. He 
scrambled up, skinned hands and 
knees smarting, and darted out of 
reach. All the Whugs were turning 
into O’Larches, now — they evident- 
ly thought it was a pretty good fight- 
ing shape. And now at least twenty 
more O’Larches burst from the va- 
cant store, fists balled. Several ran 
toward Kruger, their movements 
sadly belying the serene courtly ex- 
pressions of their faces. 

K ruger dodged toward a hotel en- 
trance, colliding with a huge 
ostrichlike alien and getting a ring- 
ing peck on the head before he got 
past. Inside the lobby, aliens were 
hopelessly tangled, fighting to get 
free of one another. 

He pushed his way through, de- 
manded of a screaming Whug 
clerk, “Where’s the back way?” . 
got no attention, and found it him- 
self. It opened into an alley. There 
was shouting to his left. He ran that 
way, reached the street, and found 



THE IMPERSONATORS 



125 




one whole end blocked by a 
struggling, screaming, bellowing mass 
of O’Larches and Krugers. 

He stood there, mouth gaping. 
There must be hundreds of ea<^! 
Then he understood. Those treach- 
erous Grugs! He should never have 
trusted them. A lot of extra ones had 
come along for the funi 

He saw a knot of them burst from 
a jewelry store, bags of loot clutched 
in their hands, looking like Krugers 
but lashing about them viciously like 
Grugs. One stopped to bite at a 
Whug who ran from the store after 
them, did poorly with the manlike 
teeth, took a blow from a tail that 
sent him rolling, dodged, got up yell- 
ing curses at the Whug and ran off 
after his fellows. 

Now Kruger heard a mob-sound 
from the other end of the street. He 
turned. A solid mass of O’Larches 
was coming. Some of the imitations 
were poor — hasty and third-or- 
fourth-hand, no doubt — but all had 
fists, and they served as a sort of uni- 
form. All Whugdom must know by 
now what was up, and they’d evi- 
dently decided to fight it out along 
the initiated lines. The leaders saw 
Kruger and pressed toward him, 
yelling for his blood. 

No use trying to prove he wasn’t 
a Grug. He spun back into the alley. 
Smoke was pouring from a building 
halfway down it now, and he heard 
the wail of sirens. An alien like a 
boa-constrictor on twenty or thirty 
stilt-legs appeared suddenly from a 
closer building, saw him, shrieked, 
“Crazy, murdering Terrans!” and 
spat a big gob of brown liquid at 
him. He dodged that, threw himself 



against the nearest door, broke it in, 
and found himself amidst a huddled 
pack of blue skinned little bipeds 
with long ears that touched together 
above their pointed heads. He fought 
through them, ran down a corridor 
(deserted, fortunately) and came out 
in what must be the foyer of a room- 
ing-house. The street outside looked 
empty, and he could hear the mob of 
O’Larches coming in the back way, 
so he jerked the door open and 
charged out, and — 

Found himself between two con- 
verging mobs, one of Krugers, one of 
O’Larches. He whirled and tried the 
door, but it had locked itself. 

The whole Settlement was one 
deafening chaos now, with the 
scream of sirens almost drowned out 
by alien, Grug, Whug and quasi- 
human voices. A mass of bodies 
plowed into him. Fists pummeled 
him. He struck out blindly, heard 
his own voice — nearly — yell, 
“Ouch, gr, damn you!” and took an 
elbow in the face. He went down 
beneath the trampling feet, and felt 
two or three hard kicks in the 
head. 

The thought shot through his mind 
— what, in all this mess, would 
become of the real O’Larch? And 
that was the last thought he had 
for a while. 

H e realized from the smell that 
he was in a hospital, but it 
took him a while to get his eyes fo- 
cused enough to see that the huge 
white blob beside his bed was a 
Moog in medico’s clothing. The 
muscular alien peered at him for a 
moment, then turned and said into 



126 



IF 




a wall grill, “One’s come around 
enough to talk, I think /* 

There was a short wait while the 
blurry room swam a little, then a 
door opened and Governor Mum- 
mumnoonoogog stepped in. He 
stood glowering from Kruger to 
something in the other bed. “Which 
one of you’s Kruger? You Terrans 
all look alike.” 

Kruger managed to croak, “I am.” 
He struggled to arise, found he 
could sit on the edge of the bed, and 
let it go at that for the moment. 

There was a muffled sound and 
a stir in the other bed. An O’Larch 
— more battered, if possible, than 
Kruger — raised a head painfully. 
“You are Inspector Kruger? The 
real one?” 

“Yeah,” Kruger growled unin- 
terestedly, “so what?” 

The other hauled himself painfully 
off the bed and advanced step by 
unsteady step, until he stood looking 
down gravely at Kruger. Battered as 
he was, his dignity did not ^desert 
him, and he almost succeeded in 



keeping the quaver out of his voice. 
“Sir, I am the embezzler, Borogrove 
O’Larch. I want to go home. I sur- 
render. Arrest me. Please!” 

Mum interrupted harshly, “You’re 
both going back to Earth, the in- 
stant I can load you on a ship. I 
don’t want you around when I get 
to the bottom of this thing. If what 
I suspect is true, I couldn’t trust 
myself to stay civilized.” His glare 
coalesced upon Kruger. “As it is, 
you and your government will prob- 
ably be hearing from us before long. 
And from a dozen other empires.” 
He turned and stalked out. 

Kruger sat there for a minute, 
then, grunting with the effort, got 
slowly to his feet. Might as well get 
the formalities over with. “Stand, 
Borogrove O’Larch,” he said glumly, 
“in the name of the Government of 
Earth.” He placed hesitant fingers 
upon the taller man’s left arm. When, 
after a minute, it had not changed, 
he let go, sighed and lay down again 
on the bed.

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



In the little town of Shuteley, England, on the hottest summer of 
any resident's memory, a party of visitors appeared. They were all 
young, and they were enormous. Moreover, they had a couple of 
traits that startled the quiet people of Shuteley. The girls in the party 
wore dresses that disappeared from time to time; and all of them had 
an unusual knowledge of what was happening in the town . and 
what was about to happen. 

The giants had established a camp on the bank of a river outside 
Shuteley, and there Val Mathers and his friend Jota shared the horrify- 
ing experience of killing and being killed . and then seeing time 
queerly reversed, so that the losers in their battles came back to life. 

Then the village of Shuteley caught fire, and Mathers realized what 
the giants were doing there. They had come back from some distant 
time in the future to observe the fire — and to rescue a few victims 
who for cryptic reasons of their own, they did not want to die. Val's 
instinctive thought was that he was one of those who was to die. But 
in fact his doom was worse. They wanted him to live — and to bear the 
guilt for starting the fire that had taken hundreds of lives! 



(because neither my father nor my 
mother had any interest in gardens, 
and ours was a jungle), but had to 
be very careful in Jota’s because 
Iota’s father was an amateur horti- 
culturist. He called himself that, 
and even at three Jota and I were 
trying to say the word, without 
much sucoess, and with no idea what 
it meant except that because Jota’s 
father was a horticulturist we had 
much more fun in my gairden. 

(All this came out with Miranda 
prodding me, in the middle of the 
stasis, with fire all around. She led 
me through my memory quite fair- 



ly, not explaining although she did 
direct. She reminded me of very lit- 
tle and never forced her some- 
times imore accurate information on 
me. All she did, really, was direct 
my attention to facts which I had 
never considered particularly signi- 
ficant, because if I had. I’d have 
had to believe the unbelievable. The 
unbelievable then. Anyway, some- 
times — quite often, indeed — my 
memory contained important things 
of which she knew nothing what- 
ever) . 

We must have been about four 
and nearly ready to go to school 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



129 





when we had contact for the first 
time with the nastiness of the out- 
side world. What happened in my 
own house I naturally took for 
granted, and anyway it was never 
nasty, merely baffling at times. I 
loved my mother and depended on 
her like any child, and ninetynfive 
per cent of the time she was like 
anybody else’s mother. It was only 
occasionally that the world turned 
upside down. Then there was scream- 
ing and rushing about and slammed 
doors and sobbing, and I knew then 
to keep quiet and pretend not to 
exist. 

The garden behind ours belonged 
to Mr. Sylvester, who was a fat red- 
faced man whom I used to like 
quite well. He used to give us ani- 
seed balls, always throwing them 
and laughing all over his fat body 
when we failed to catch them, as 
we always did. 

Later, however, Mr. Sylvester 
changed. Jota (who was Clarence 
then — the name didn’t seem strange 
to either of us until we went to 
school) and I didn’t understand why 
he had changed. Until Miranda 
made me think about it, I didn’t 
realize that he was simply a gardener 
jealous of Iota’s father’s achieve- 
ments. He didn’t throw aniseed balls 
to us any more. Over the fence, he 
asked at times why we didn’t run 
about in Iota’s garden the way we 
did in mine. 

Then he started complaining about 
our garden, saying the weeds were 
coming through the fence. To Iota 
and me this was manifest nonsense, 
because we had never seen a plant 
walk. 



Anyway, there was constant trou- 
ble 'between Mr. Sylvester and lota’s 
father, and between Mr. Sylvester 
and my father, and even between 
my father and lota’s father, be- 
cause lota’s father said weeds did 
go through fences and it was time 
my father did something about the 
jungle. 

Iota and I never understood the 
situation, but what we did know 
was that we could never play in 
either garden any more without 'be- 
ing shouted at by lota’s father or 
my father or Mr. Sylvester. And we 
both managed to work out, without 
the slightest trouble, that the whole 
thing was Mr. Sylvester’s fault. 

Really, it was quite a crisis in 
the life of a couple of four-year- 
olds. We were not aUowed to wan- 
der about the town, to play in the 
streets, to disappear for hours. In 
the back gardens, until Mr. Sylvester 
spoiled everything, we’d spent whole 
days of childish delight every time 
it didn’t rain. 

One day Mr. Sylvester ceased 
bothering us. He was dead. 

I t was the day we went to school 
that Iota and I fell out for the 
first time. Of course we had argued 
and sulked, but until then we had 
both been too dependent upon each 
other ever to cut off our nose to 
spite our face. My parents and 
lota’s parents both accepted our 
friendship as something that caused 
them less trouble than any other 
acquaintance, and i^ we fought we 
suffered for it, and we knew it. 
Other kids either of us brought 
home were not welcome. Neither 



130 



IF 




iota’s parents nor mine wanted out- 
siders poking their noses in, even 
children. Behind children were 
adults. 

So Jota and I fairly intelligent 
kids, had realized long since that 
fighting with each other didn’t pay. 

At school, a maelstrom of noise, 
high laughter, peculiar smells, un- 
accustomed regimentation, girls 
(neither Jota nor I had ever had 
anything to do with girls and had 
quite made up our minds we never 
would), harsh-voiced adults pre- 
tending to be on our side, huge 
windows, endless corridors, electric 
light in the daytime, stairs, fright- 
ening large boys and girls, even 
more frightening people in black 
coats and square hats, one thing 
stood out in my memory — the 
howl of laughter when Jota said his 
name was Clarence. 

The teacher laughed too, though 
she tried to pretend she hadn’t. 

They laughed again, twice as 
loudly, when he added the second 
half, Mulliner. 

I wanted to jump up and hit 
the whole lot of them. They hadn’t 
laughed when, just before, I had 
said I was Val Mathers. My real 
Christian name was Valentine, but 
I’d always been called Val, so that’s 
what I said. Now everybody was 
laughing at Claren^_ Mulliner, my 
pal. 

I didn’t jump up because. 
well, I didn’t. 

The funny thing was that as we 
were going home, free for the rest 
of the day — the first day was 
a half day — I giggled myself at 
the recollection of the childish 



laughter when Clarence, all unwit- 
tin^y, gave his name. It was child- 
like. When they laughs at Clar- 
ence, my friend, I wanted to fight 
them all (though I didn’t). But 
afterwards . well, I lauded so 
much I could hardly walk. 

Clarence — I call^ him Clarence 
then, and went on doing so until 
he became, for all time, Jota — 
didn’t lose his temper at once. He 
waited for me to return to normal. 
But I couldn’t. The more I laughed 
the funnier it all became. 

And then he hit me once, on 
the chest, and ran away. 

My laughter slowly died, not be- 
cause I’d been hurt, not really 'be- 
cause I was sorry I’d laughed, but 
mainly because I had, after all, been 
laughing at Jota. ^ long as he 
stayed to be laughed at, I went on 
doing it. But there’s no pount in 
laughing at someone who doesn’t 
hang around to be laughed at. 

I went home. I tried to see Jota, 
but nobody answered the door. 

At tea time I wasn’t hungry. Lat^ 
I was sick. My father, even my 
mother, began to get concerned. I 
went to bed with a hot-water bot- 
tle. 

N ext morning I was no better, 
and the doctor was sent for. He 
examined me thoroughly* Bind then 
he and my father talked at the foot 
of the bed in low tones. Later my 
father came and sat on the bed 
and talked quietly to me. 

At the time I didn’t understand, 
didn’t realize there was anything 
to understand except that I was ill. 
But many years later it was easy 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



131 




to guess what the doctor had said 
and what my father thought about 
it, and what must have beea in his 
mind when he talked to me. 

The doctor had been unable to 
find anything wrong with me, yet 
obviously I was quite seriously ill. 
Being a young, up-to-date doctor, he 
immediately thought of psychos<Mna- 
tic illness. It figured. I lived in a 
strange home — he knew that, be- 
ing the doctor for the whole family. 
I had just gone to school. He had 
found a quite int^esting case — 
a child of five, otherwise apparently 
normal, prostrated by psychosomotic 
illness. 

Jota came to see me at lunch- 
time. He was quiet, puzzled and very 
contrite. He seemed to think he was 
responsible for my illness because 
he had diildishly punched me on the 
chest 

I told them that was silly, there 
wasn’t ^ven a mark, and I was 
sorry Fd laughed at him in the first 
place. 

I was ill for three weeks and 
nevtt: fully recovered that first 
schoid term. 

Then there was a very small in- 
cident about two years later .... 

It was the next time Jota and I 
really quarreled. Miranda didn’t 
seem to know anything about this. 
I was quite unable to remember 
what the quarrel was about, or any 
details, except that Jota finally grew 
cold, stared at me, and said: "I’ll 
fix you!” in a tone of menace quite 
stariflmg coming from a seven-year- 
old boy. 

And that was all. Nothing hap- 
pened. 



T he fire that had consumed all 
of S^utdey was a dull red glow 
around us, but inside the stasis we 
felt nothing. 

Miranda was puzzled. She had 
been making me reqiember things, 
not as I might have expected, by 
being in possession of all the facts 
and prompting my flagging memory, 
but by directing my attention to 
o^lain types of incidents in my 
relations with Jota. 

And this incident had her beat. 
She tried to mal^ me remember 
that Jota had not really been in 
a cold fury with me, or that he 
got over it at (mce. 

In fact, Jota and I ceased to be 
friends for fully three months, and 
during that time he made no secret 
of the fact that he hated me. 

I was, after ah, a much more 
normal boy than Jota, and I made 
other frie^. He stayed solitary, 
walking home alone, standing in 
the playground alone. 

And it was because of that that 
we finally became friends again. 

One of my new friends was Gh 
Carswell, who was studious but not 
always quiet. In those days he was 
a sort of juvenile Jekyll and Hyde, 
usually the best boy in the school 
from the point of view of author- 
ity. intelligent, polite, haird-workiiig, 
good at games, a paragon of school- 
boy virtues. But now and then he’d 
kick over the traces. 

However, this incident had very 
IMe to do with Gil, not until it 
was over, anyway. 

It was the morning interval. I 
was with Gil. Across the playground, 
beside the bush which divided the 



132 



IF 




junior boys’ section from the girls’, 
Jota was standing alone as usual, 
stadng into spa^e, his mind far 
away. 

About a dozen boys were kicking 
a bah around near him. Inevitaibly 
the ball went near him, and one <k 
the boys chasing it came close to 
Jota. 

They didn’t come in contact, and 
across the playground I had no idea 
what was said. I was watching only 
idly, until the group began to gather 
rou^ Jota. Then I began to have 
a vague, though fundamentally cor- 
rect, idea of what was happening. 

No wild animals are as cruel 
as children. They don’t know how. 

Jota, standing alone, had set him- 
self apart as a target, as a victim. 
The boys (bigger than us, from a 
higher class) were taunting turn, 
trying to outdo each other in the 
wit and virulenoe of their insists. 

Automaticaily Gil and 1 moved 
across the playground. Nothing 
draws boys more surely and quickly 
than a ifight, and it was obvious 
there was going to be a fight. 

We weren’t the only ones. Every- 
one in <die playground was crowding 
to the same s^. Even some of 
gids 'behind the hedge and fence 
were beginning to take notice, the 
bigger girls looking over, the smaiQ^ 
ones jumping up to take a quick 
look. 

There were three playgrounds at 
the old Grammar School. Everything 
was old, dingy and overcixiwded, 
and the playgrounds were far too 
small. Round at the back, com- 
pletely cut off from us, were the 
senior boys. But all the girls, from 



five to eighteen, were in the same 
section. The idea was, presumably, 
that big boys might bully sm^ 
boys, ^ ^ds didn’t do things 
like that. 

B olstering each other up, the tor- 
mentors were becoming bolder. 
At first they merely touched Jota 
lightly when they leaped at him. 
Then they punch^ him. Then they 
started pulling his tie, grabbing his 
shirt, clawing at his buttons. 

Still a few feet of space was left 
between Jota and the heaving mass 
of boys, tacitly maintained to keep 
Jota ^e quarry and everyone else 
a hunter. 

liis nose was bleeding and blood 
was running down his chin from a 
cut at the comer of his mouth. 
Most of us were howling — I be- 
lieve I was howling with the rest. 
We were huntsmen, and we had 
cornered the fox. We were out for 
the kill. 

Whtti bis shirt came out of his 
pants, we shrieked with laughter. 
He was near the end of his tether. 
His shkt, minus all buttons, was 
now haogiBg open under his jacket, 
and his thin white chest was 
heaving at lightening speed. There 
was no sign of any let-up. 

Flight had never seem^ possible 
for Jota, slsioe from the begmning 
he had been hemmed in against the 
bush and fence. But in his extremity 
he sudd^ily did something that none 
of us expected. 

He leaped back, seized the top 
of the fence and somehow drew 
himself over. The next moment he 
was in the girls’ playground. 



134 



IP 




For a moment llie shouts died as 
if we'd aU (been stmick dumb. Then 
the whole mass of boys charged the 
fence, ignoring the bushes, and al- 
though none of us got over as 
Jota had done, we were all hang- 
ing over the fence, watching, if not 
chasing our quarry, hunting him 
with our eyes and our shouts. 

The little girls all ran away, 
screaming. Boys were not supposed 
to be in the ‘girls’ playground. It 
was a rule, and not one of the hun- 
dreds of rules made to 'be broken. 
Nobody had expected Jota even 
to try to get into the girls’ play- 
ground. 

One massive woman of seventeen 
or eighteen caught Jota by the 
collar and lifted him. There was 
a scream of laughter on both sides 
of the fence. She did it again . 

He fell out of his jacket and she 
was left holding it. He darted for 
the gate. 

We rushed to our gate. He was 
on the other side of the road, 
panting desperately. Habit was so 
strong that he wanted to come 
back (the interval must be nearly 
over). But scores of boys were 
hanging over the gate. 

I didn’t think. I jumped, over 
the gate and ran across the road. 
Jota flinched and turned, evidently 
thinking that even the school boun- 
dary couldn’t stop the chase. 

But I caught his arm. “Come on 
back, Clarence,” I said. 

Once again the shouting and 
howling died. 

Suddenly sanity was restored. 1 
had done quite a bit to restore it, 
but could take little credit for it. 

SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



By Standing with Jota, by allying 
myself with him, 1 h^ reminded 
everybody that be was one of us, 
not an outlaw to be taken dead or 
alive, not a fox to be slaughtered 
as bloodily as possible, not a mouse 
to be tortured and ibroken and per- 
haps left, mercilessly, still alive. 

I could take very little <aedit be- 
cause I should have done this long 
before, because instead of doing it 
when I might have turned the en- 
tire incident I had been howling 
with the rest. 

Anyway, as the shouting died, the 
whistle to end the break shrilled, 
and we all trooped back into school, 
including Jota and me. 

The fun was over. 

xxvm 

G il, Jota and I became friends 
after that. Curiously, Jota’s 
fifteen-minute ordeal was ignored 
and forgotten and canceled as if it 
had never happened. 

The teachers must have known 
something had happened. Signs of 
the damage to bushes and fences 
was still visible six months later. 
Jota could not have looked any- 
thing like his usual self in class, 
although his nose had stopped 
bleeding, his face had been washed, 
and his jacket — thrown over the 
fence by one of the girls — hid 
the ruin of his shirt. 

In any event, nothing was done. 
And the boys at the school, too, 
scarcely remembered the episode. 
One or two of them, I knew, tried 
to taunt Jota later — but they were 
unwise enough to do it individually, 

135 




and in such circumstances Jota was 
perfectly capable of looking after 
himself. 

Looking after himself. 

Two weeks later, there was a 
special assembly. The Head was 
very grave. Two boys, dose friends, 
had died in one day, one of (hitherto 
unusupected heart trouble, and the 
other in a road accident. A special 
service was held. All the good things 
the boys had ever done were de- 
tailed, and everything else quietly 
forgotten. 

I knew of course, that these two 
had been the ringleaders in the 
humiliation of Jota. But no sig- 
nificance in that fact, beyond the 
obvious coincidence, occurred to 
me. Jota could hardly have any con- 
trol over road accidents, especially 
since at the time it happened he 
was with Gil and me and dearly had 
nothing in his mind beyond our 
search for birds’ nests. I might, at 
that age, have believed that God 
had punished them for their wicked- 
ness. It didn’t cross my mind that 
Jota had. 

M iranda didn’t make me remem- 
ber subsequent events in any 
detail, except one — one which 
introduced an entirely new concept. 

There had been the case of Squire 
Badgeley. ... He wasn’t a squire 
at all, but he looked like one and 
he owned an orchard. Probably for 
every apple that he got, the boys 
of Shuteley Grammar School got 
two. In my earliest recollections of 
the squire, he seemed quite philo- 
sophical about this. 

But now it was wartime. We were 



too young to take much note of the 
war; the restrictions and shortages 
we accepted as we accepted the 
rain and the wind, and our mem- 
ories of a time when there was 
no need to pull curtains at night 
and when unlimited good things 
were obtainable merely on produc- 
tion of cash were dim and vague. 

But Squire Badgeley took note 
of the war. He had three sons in 
the RAF, and his one daughter 
worked with him, a Land Girl, as 
we called them then. In addition 
to apples, he *grew raspberries, black- 
currants and a wide range of vege- 
tables. And we 'boys not only stole 
his fruit, but damaged and destroyed 
his carrots, turnii>s, caibbages and 
lettuces. 

He became an ogre (from our 
angle). He guarded his orchard, 
chased us and reported us to the 
Head. The Head, whom we dimly 
remembered being as philosophical 
as the squire had once been about 
our depredations, now became as- 
tonishingly harsh. 

Jota was caught once, and the 
squire beat him. 

Two weeks later the squire died. 
But that wasn’t the end of the Bad- 
geley story. 

It was not until long after the 
war that we broke our vows about 
girls. Jota broke his firpt. One week 
he obviously didn’t know any more 
than we did a'bout the birds and the 
bees, though we were all becoming 
hotly interested; the next, he was 
able to tell us, in remarkable de- 
tail, everything we could possibly 
want to Imow. 

We didn’t really believe his stor- 



136 



IF 




ies at first. But soon it was im- 
possible -not to (believe tbem. Girls 
of a!U ages swaimed aiouiul Jota. 
(He was Jota now, duly having 
been christened by Mr. Samuel, the 
science master). In juv^iBe mascu- 
line arrogance he used to induce 
us to deride his chances with a 
particular girl, often four or five 
years older than he was, and then 
make the conquest and prove it. 

This was before the days of wide- 
spread promiscuity at mixed schools. 
Shuteley was an old-fashioned town, 
too, twill behind the times. Senior 
girls did not then wear yellow golli- 
wogs to claim loss of virginity. If 
Jota had not existed, only one or 
two of the most forward senior 
girls would have had furtive noc- 
turnal adventures, mainly with the 
'boys of the town who had left 
school. Fewer still of the senior 
boys would have had such exp^- 
iences, and they would have been 
with willing farm girls rather than 
the supposedly pure senior girfs. 

Jota, on his own, created an un- 
precedented situation. Every ap- 
ple ripe enough to pluck, he pluck- 
ed. He collected girls like stamps. 
It made not the slightest difference 
what form they were in, from Third 
to Sixth. He knew enough, of course, 
not to leave a trail of illegitimate 
babies behind him. I believe that 
throughout his life, only when he 
was too impatient for a particular 
girl did he ever take chances. 

It was not long after Dina was 
bom that Gil, goaded by Iota’s fan- 
tastic success and the fact that Gil 
and I were still virgins, and likely 
to remain so for some time, hit on 



a chalilenge that was to reduce Jota 
to oze« 

He broui^t up the name of Anne 
Badge3ey. 

A ll three of Squke Badgeley’s sons 
had been killed -in the war. 
Anne, left alone, ran the orchard 
herself, with hired hands to' help 
her. Althou^ she could hardly be 
said to be fortunate, money was 
not one of her problems. She was 
certainly the richest girl in Shute- 
ley. 

At the time when Gil made his 
outrageous suggestion, she was 
probably one of the most desirable 
girls in the town and undoubtedly 
the most desired. There wasn’t much • 
doubt that the reason why she hadn’t 
married was tied up with her wealth. 
Whether the average young man in 
town wanted Anne, her orchard or 
her money was a matter for con- 
jecture. But he certainly wanted all 
three. 

She was still in the first half of 
her twenties, and Jota was not less 
than ten years younger. She didn’t 
exactly seem old to us, 'being 
younger than Betty Grable, Rita 
Hayworth and Lana Turner, whose 
pin-up photographs we were begin- 
ning to stick up in our bachelor 
bedrooms. Indeed, with her habit of 
working in' the summer in her 
orchard dressed like our pin-up girls, 
she was the nearest tiling to the 
gorgeous creatures of our adoles- 
cent dreams. 

She worked in the orchard be- 
hind a fence and a high hedge, but 
peepholes could always be found, 
and the summer working clothes

of Anne Badgdey were a daily 
topic of ioiflamed speculation aimong 
us. When wore slacks we lost 
interest — or some interest. But 
when she wore shorts and parti- 
cularly one day when above her 
tight shorts she made do with a 
flimsy chiffon scarf, cardessly tied, 
she rocked the male half of the 
Grammar School to its foundations. 

But she was as much out of 
reach as Betty, Rita and Lana. The 
very idea of Jota and Anne, Anne 
and Jota, was ridiculous, which was 
why Gil made the suggestkwi. 

Jota took the challenge. And a 
week later, he made us hide in the 
orchard to watch. 

Late on a hot summer evening, 
he and Anne came out. 

Gil and I were part shocked, part 
disgusted, but mainly wildly en- 
vious. Why had Jota been singled 
out to be able to do such things? 
The girl was head over heels in love 
with him; he could do anything he 
liked with her, even we coidd see 
that. 

In the autumn, Anne died. She 
fell off a ladder and broke her 
back. 

XXIX 

D ina was still asleep. She changed 
her position easily, regularly, 
without fuss and without making 
a noise. 

Around us now, beyond the sta- 
sis, was a red glow. It would be 
many hours yet before it would be 
possible for Dina and me, unless 
wearing one of the giants’ suits, 
to leave the spot. But the fire had 



consumed nearly all there was to 
consume. 

The Great Fire of London had 
burned for days. War-time fires 
started by incendiaries had often 
been blazing still when the bombers 
returned the following night. Shute- 
ley, however, was annihilated in a 
relativdy small, exceedin^y fierce, 
shockingly rapid fire. What re- 
mained would gjow for a long time, 
but little or nothing remained to 
blaze. 

And there was one suit in the 
stasis. As I understood it, just be- 
fore dawn the stasis would dis- 
appear, and Miranda would be 
plucked back to her own time. But 
anyone not of her party would 
simply be left, suddenly without the 
protection of the stasis, to die. 

Certainly to die. There would 
be enough heat left to char the 
ground, to bum Dina and me ap- 
parendy as all the other victims 
had b^Q burned — more slowly 
but no less surely, so that when 
people from outside first reached 
the village green (that afternoon? 
next day?) th^e would be no indi- 
cation that the stasis had ever 
existed, or of the identity of the 
two blackened skeletons in it. 

But I was still oddly unconcerned 
about this. There was one suit, and 
there was still plenty of time. Any- 
way, I did not believe I was go- 
ing to die. Dina could have the 
suit. Dina, whom I expected to re- 
cover consciousness soon, could 
make her escape . and I wouldn’t 
die. 

“What are you telling me?” I 
asked Miranda. 



138 



IF 




She shrugged. “I’ve beea careful 
not to tell you anything. You’re idl- 
ing me.” 

“But I’m remembering what you 
tell me to remember. That Mr. 
Sylvester was a nuisaiioe to Iota, and 
he died. That Jota quarreled with 
me, and I nearly died. That the 
two boys who led the mob against 
Jota died. That Squire Badgdey 
beat Jota, and he died. That Anne 
Badgeley — ” 

“You’re leaving out some very 
important things. About ah those 
girls, sdioolgiris mostly, but older 
girls too. Particularly Anne. She 
could have had anyone in Shuteley, 
you said. Why did die pick a kid 
barely into his teens?” 

“You’re sarong Jota did all this? 
Any man he wants cmt of the way 
dies? Any girl he wants says yes?” 
She nodded. “He has the Gift. 
And you’re wrong to say any man. 
What about Anne? When he’d fin- 
ished with her, he made her die.” 
“Why would he want rid of 
her?” 

“The oldest reason, probably. She 
was pregnant. With others 'ho was 
more careful. With her he was too 
impatient, too reddess. And it 
seemed to Jota that it would be 
better for him if Anne died.” 
“You’re saying he condemined all 
these people to death?” 

“No,” die said -thoughtfully, “Not 
that. I imagine that at first, he 
simply thought, perhaps not even 
consciously: Everything wauld be 
fine but for Mr. Sylvester. And soon 
Mr. Sylvester wasn’t there. But after 
this had happened a few times, 
Jota must have begun to realize. 



.... There’s another thing he ob- 
viously has found out by this time 
— with the ability to attack goes 
defense. Nobody can kill Jota. No 
person can kBl Jota. Of course he 
could die by accident, like anyone 
else — his power is over people. 
Originaliy he died in this fire.” 
“Wait,” I said “That doesn’t jell. 
I just killed him. Yesterday Gheg 
kiUed him. You say that before you 
intervened, the fire killed him. Seems 
that for an indestnictihle character 
he gets destroyed a hell of a lot.” 

M iranda was following her own 
own train of thought, not 
mine. “Later, in adolescence, he 
found out something else. After any 
girl refused him — ” 

“No girl ever refused him,” I 
said. 

“(^ yes. Time time. You 
weren’t ^ere. Nei>ther was I, but I 
can tell you what happened. The 
first meeting was always as you’d 
expect. But later — a girl who 
sneared at Jota would come crawling 
to him. She’d beg him, as I — ” 
She flushed. “I think you heard 
what Greg and I were saying at 
the bridge. You’re wrong if you’ve 
any idea that people with the Gift 
are smooth, practiced lovers. They 
don’t have to be. It’s crude, it’s 
bestial. They say: T want you,’ and 
that’s it. Not the first time. The 
Gift needs time to work. When 
Jota or Greg wants a man dead, 
he doesn’t drop dead on the spot. 
It takes time to happen.” 

The paradoxes and inconsistencies 
that had bothered me were grad- 
ually melting away. 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



139 




I could see how Greg could have 
killed Jota. If two people had this 
Gift, presumaibly it was canceled 
out Greg had mo special pow^ over 
Jota, but then Jota had no spe- 
cial defense against Greg. So the 
matter was settled simply with pis- 
tols. There was also the cryptic ex- 
change between them which 1 now 
understood better: 

GREG: Yoi/re a bit Hke me, 
JOTA : In more ways than one, 
GREG: Remember ... 7 killed 
you, 

JOTA: Remember .,, I let you. 
Yes ... I understood and ac- 
cepted that. I also understood and 
accepted this new explanation of 
Iota’s power over women. He ap- 
proached them, they reacted exactly 
as they wished, free to do as they 
willed (I now remember I had 
never been privileged to see any of 
the prriiminaries, only the conse- 
quences). Later, when something 
had worked on them, they became 
possessed, day in Jota’s hands. 

More of the inconsistendes dis- 
solved when I looked at them. Jota 
had been brutish toward both 5Sieila 
and Dina. That was how it started. 
Later, if he persisted, things would 
be very different. But instinctively 
wise in the case of Shelia, I had 
sent Jota away, unconsciously know- 
ing what Sheila hated me for think- 
ing, that what she thought or want- 
ed or said didn’t count, ordy what 
Jota wanted. And as for Dina, 
there had not been an Act Two, 
and there never would be. 

Then, having prepared the way, 
Miranda told me about the Gift 
in her own world. 



I don’t remember her words. She 
spoke for a long time. A lot of 
what she said I didn’t believe at 
first, ibut gradually disbelief was 
borne down. 

Greg and Jota and three per cent 
of the population in 2197 had a 
Gift, which was quite simply that 
ability to make people die or surren-. 
der sexually. It was nothing else. 

It was fundamentally a mascu- 
line phenomenon. So few women 
possessed it that they were freaks, 
usually choosing to conceal, aban- 
don, deny their possession of the 
Gift. 

Those with the Gift, then, were 
men, and if they didn’t rule the 
world, they prevented anyone else 
from ruling it effectively. 

Most of them, fortunately, were 
law-abiding . but what could be 
done about the rogues like Greg? 
Virtually nothing. That was why 
Greg was present bn an expedition 
aimed at the limitation or even 
destruction of his kind, able to 
sabotage it at will, because nobody 
could stop him. 

Miranda couldn’t stop him. If 
Greg cared to decide at any mom- 
ent that she should die, and simply 
decided it instead of crudely, im- 
pulsively and rashly trying to break 
her body with one blow, then she 
would die in less than two weeks. 
And the cause of death could not 
legally ibe connected with Greg. 

I protested at this. Had no mur- 
der charge ever been brought against 
one of these people? When the Gift 
was known to exist, when threats 
had been made, when a death duly 
took place exactly as forecast . .?

IF 




“Think, Val,” said Miranda wear- 
ily. ‘Take the clearest possible case 
. ima^e the clearest possible 
case, and then think abont it. The 
detectives who built the case 
would have to be immune. The 
cops who arrested the accused would 
have to be immune. The jailers, 
judge, jury and lawyers would have 
to be immune. And in common 
justice they’d have to prove that 
the accused had the Oift and had 
used it ddiberately to end another 
person’s life.” 

She shook her head. “It can’t be 
done. Especially since the actual 
cause of death is always natural — 
illness, accident or suicide, with no 
physical intervention by the real 
killer.” 

So Greg was with the Shuteley 
party. Some of those who had tried 
to stop him had died. Threats were 
enough to silence the others. Mir- 
anda’s attitude, a perfectly reason- 
able one after all, was that she 
could at least keep an eye on him 
and try to defeat him. 

In addition to ordinary -people 
and those who had the Gift, there 
were some who were simply im- 
mune. They did not possess the 
Gift; but those who did could ac- 
complish nothing against them. Un- 
fortunately there were fewer of 
these than those who had the Gift. 

The Gift and immunity were 
hereditary. This did not mean that 
die Gift was often passed on. It 
merely meant that it could be passed 
on. 

Miranda’s world, the world of the 
giants (women of five feet four were 
as rare in her world, she told me, 



as women of four feet eleven in 
ours) was a good world on the 
surface and a seething cesspool of 
fear and chaos and self-destruction 
underneath. 

And all because of the Gift. 

The sexual side of it, she pointed 
out, was virtually unimportant. That 
was merely a by-product, a side 
issue. It existed, probably, because 
sex as well as survival was basic. 
Anyone who could control life and 
death could also control the sex 
impulse. 

That was nothing. A small min- 
ority of Casanovas could* be a 
nuisance, but they couldn’t push a 
whole world over a precipice. 

T he threat of death was another 
matter altogether. There was no 
need for any Greg to be educated, 
clever, handsome, careful, obliging, 
efficient or self-respecting. Anyone 
who said or did anything a Greg 
didn’t like could be rubbed out and 
forgotten. It was senseless to be 
brave when faced with a Greg. After 
he had eradicated you, he could 
quite easily, on the merest whim, 
eradicate your wife and family as 
well. 

As far as anyone knew, the Gift 
was a chance mutation. Immunity 
was probably allied to it, tifiough no 
one could be sure. Immunity might 
have existed always, unrecognized, 
purposeless, until the Gift emerged. 

Twisting of time was only one 
of the desperate measures tried in 
an attempt to restore sanity to the 
world of 2197. Miranda hinted at 
others, refused to tell me about any, 
and said that an}^ay they had all

failed miserably, sometimes tragical- 

>y- 

I Started to suggest one angle that 
occurred to me, the arrangement of 
accidents, since Gregs could be kill- 
ed in accidents like anybody else, 
and she cut me off rather impatient- 
ly. Such attempts were the most dis- 
astrous of all. They made all peo- 
ple who possessed the Gift, includ- 
ing those who steadfastly refused 
to use it, band together for their own 
survival. 

So we came to the purpose of the 
Shuteley operation. 

Clearly if everybody possessed the 
Gift, or if everybody was immune, 
or if everybody was one way or the 
other, the problem would cease to 
exist. 

According to the river-of-time 
theory, the people of 2197 would 
continue to exist no matter what 
was done to the past, short of a 
major diversion which would force 
the flow into a completely different 
course. But their capacities might 
be changed. Miranda might, after 
certain changes had been made, find 
herself immune. Or she might have 
the Gift. Or nobody might have the 
Gift. 

It was a desperate scheme, born 
of desperation. It was carried out 
in a manner little short of insanity, 
in a completely useless attempt to 
get the whole thing done under 
cover. 

It was entrusted to an ordinary 
history class in an ordinary school 
under an ordinary teacher. 

A history class would go back 
and see the Great Fire of Shuteley, 
1966 A.D. They would do nothing 



to alter the flow of events except 
remove Garry Carswell. 

That was the cover: a minor 
operation like many others (none 
of them directed against possessors 
of the Gift), of no particular in- 
terest to anyone not directly con- 
cerned. Miranda knew all about it, 
but none of the students did. As 
far as they were concerned, the 
rescue of Garry Carswell, and a 
few others, was all that was involved, 
apart from the opportunity to see 
the Great Fire. 

It might possibly have worked. 

But three per cent possession of 
the Gift meant that one in thirty- 
three adults, teenagers or children 
had it. So no school was free of it. 

Greg was in another class, a 
lower class. He applied to join the 
expedition to 1966. The headmas- 
ter, the far more important people 
behind the headmaster and the less 
important people below, aU knew 
that the inclusion of Greg would 
ruin everything. 

But Greg had made up his mind, 
and nothing else mattered. It wasu’t 
even possible to cancel the scheme. 
Greg, if he felt like it, could easily 
block the cancellation. 

Greg went with the party. 

XXX 

Jota,” I said. ‘Tell me 
why you want Jota.” 

She hesitated. “It’s only a theory 
that if we saved Jota the situation 
might improve. Perhaps it would 
be worse. You’ve been baffled 
in the last twenty-four hours by 
what we know and what we don’t 



142 



IF 




know, Val. We knew that Jota 
would arrive at your office at 3:10 
this afternoon, but I didn’t know 
Dina existed. We had pictures of 
you, so I knew you when I saw 
you in the bar, but we had no 
pictures of Jota. And that’s why I 
came to your office — to see him, 
to be able to recognize him, so that 
there would be no possibility of 
mistaken identity later. We didn’t 
know, of course, that you and he 
would go to the camp, because that 
was a new train of events alto- 
gether.” 

“Why didn’t you do some pre- 
liminary scouting?” 

“For several reasons, but the main 
one was to try to rush this through 
without attracting the attention of 
people like Greg. It wasn’t supposed 
to be a big, important operation, 
just — ” 

“Just a sightseeing tour,” I said. 

“Well, yes. Anyway, one thing 
we do know for certain is that 
around you here in Shutdey in 
1966 there were important elements 
in the Gift-immunity hereditary 
lines. Some were strong, some weak 
. it’s possible that the whole 
situation developed from a single 
latent mutant who lived here thirty 
or fifty or eighty years ago. But 
we haven’t been able to trace any 
such person.” 

“You hoped saving Jota would 
give more people in your time the 
Gift. Or better still, immunity with- 
out the Gift.” 

“That’s it exacdy. Leaving Jota 
to die, as he did originally, obvious- 
ly didn’t stop the spread of the 
mutation. Historians believe that 



saving his strain may do what you 
just said. One thing we are sure 
of is that the immunity strain is 
here too, if we can somehow de- 
velop it. But ail we can do, all we 
know about to try, is to save Jota. 
He was the first, by far the first, 
to possess the Gift complete. Dec- 
ades were to pass before anyone 
appeared with the power so fully 
developed — ” 

“And he really had no chil- 
dren?” 

“We think not. We’re almost sure 
that — ” She stopped suddenly. 

I followed the direction of her 
eyes and saw Greg. 

H e was carrying a spare suit, 
which he dropped when he 
saw Miranda. His expression an- 
swered one question. He had meant 
to kill her, and thought he had. 

Yet he didn’t say, “How did you 
get here?” He demanded: **What 
have you done?** 

J^e stood up. “What could I do?” 
There was a slight emphasis on the 
“I”. 

“I’ve lost it,” he said hoarsely. 
“Something’s taken it away from me. 
I felt it go ... I couldn’t test it 
with death, that takes too long. 
And I wanted to know. I tested it 
with girls. With Harrie, Wendy, 
Mary, Chloe. They couldn’t under- 
stand it either. But they all 
hate me, can you understand that?” 
Miranda seemed to grow as tall 
as Greg. A great joy flooded her. 
“You’ve lost it?” she said. “Maybe 
there is natural justice after all. 
You’re just a kid now, a great over- 
grown kid. And helpless.” 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



143 




“Helpless?” he almost shouted, 
drawing himself up to his enor- 
mous height. Yet he was almost 
blubbering. Curiously enough, I 
could understand him. I’d known 
Jota for a long time. Jota had a 
strange Gift, and, I now believed, 
very Iktle else. His power, his per- 
sonality, his success had all come 
from something he couldn’t help. 
He had Something; he wasn’t Some- 
body. 

It’s not necessarily true, as you’re 
always told when you’re a kid, that 
a bully must be a coward. Yet 
there is a weakness, if not necessar- 
ily in courage. A strong, brave, 
whole man or boy doesn’t have to 
prove himself at the expense of the 
weak. He may trample carelessly 
on the weak, as strong men do. But 
he doesn’t seek out the weak to 
torture and humiliate them. He’d 
rather engage in a real contest with 
someone his own size. 

Jota and Greg had this in com- 
mon, I now saw, that the thing 
that set them apart was important 
to them, vital to them. They weren’t 
like a banker who happened to be 
a talented violinist, enjoying playing 
the violin for his own pleasure and 
that of others, but with no compul- 
sion to tell every new bank client 
at once that he was a brilliant 
violinist. As far as I ^ knew Jota 
hadn’t used his Gift to kill more 
than half a dozen people. But he’d 
had to go on making amatory con- 
quests — he’d been forced to go 
on. Now that I had the key I could 
see his Don Juan activities in a 
different light, and no longer en- 
vied him in the slightest. Every girl 



who didn’t want him had to be 
made to want him. 

Greg, however, was the problem 
of the moment. As he and Miranda 
faced each other, I knew that the 
way this whole thing would go de- 
pended on what happened now be- 
tween Greg and Miranda — and 
me. Because I mattered, too. 

44X7"es, helpless.” I said. “But 
X you knew that quite a while 
ago, Greg, didn’t you? You just 
didn’t want to believe it.” 

He looked at me as if astonished 
to see me there. Then, remember- 
ing, he looked around. His gaze 
passed over the sleeping Dina with- 
out stopping. “Where’s Jota?” he 
said. 

I had become strong and confi- 
dent. I felt it, as Greg had felt 
his reduction to size, but the oppo- 
site way. I didn’t even have to 
stand up. I was still sitting on the 
burnt earth. 

“I killed him, Greg,” I said. “He 
was trying to add Dina to his list. 
I didn’t mean to kill him, but I’m 
not sorry he’s dead. I’m beginning 
to think his death was necessary.” 
“You killed him,” Greg murmur- 
ed. “Yom killed him.” 

“Why pretend to be surprised? 
You wanted to kill me and 
couldn’t. You had to save me in- 
stead. I guess you managed to con- 
vince yourself that you didn’t need 
to kill me in the fire, that it was 
neater and cleverer and just as effi- 
cient to bring me here to die when 
the stasis was removed. But the 
truth was, you couldn’t kill me. The 
most you could do was place me 



144 



IF 




in circumstances where I might die.” 

It was Miranda’s turn not to be 
able to follow what was going on. 
She had a glimmering of under- 
standing, but there was still a lot 
she couldn’t fit into place. 

Greg understood. He stared at 
me with naked hate and clothed 
fear. “Who are you, Val Mathers?” 
he whispered. 

“Nobody in particular,” I said. 
“But once Jota wanted to get rid 
of me. He nearly got rid of me, 
and I came back. And the next time 
he wanted to get rid of me, I didn’t 
feel a thing. And an hour or two 
ago, you tried to kill me. But you 
couldn’t, could you? You had to 
bring me here instead and just hope 
I’d die. And when Jota and I fought, 
he died.” 

Miranda was standing quite still. 
“You’re immune, Val,” she whis- 
pered. “You were the first neutral. 
Only your life had no effect, be- 
cause you never had children. But 
after "what I told you. .” 

> I understood now. I understood 
what had changed, and why. 

Jota was an irrelevance anyway. 
In the first run of these few days, 
he had died; in the second, he still 
died. So he was unimportant. He 
was a red herring. 

“I was different. In the first fire, 
I hadn’t died, evidently (or I’d never 
have become the scapegoat). In the 
fire altered by the intervention of 
the giants, I was certain I wasn’t 
going to die either. But one thing 
differed. But for Miranda, I’d never 
have had children. Now (I trusted 
her — on the whole I trusted her) I 
certainly would. 

SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



And Greg now became impotent. 

Y et not, perhaps, entirely im- 
potent, in all senses. 

His attention was all on me now. 
“You,” he muttered. “It must be 
you. By intervening, we mixed you 
up in this thing in a way you never 
were before. Before we took a 
hand, you and Sheila and l^na 
stayed at home and never knew a 
thing was happening until it was 
over. Your curtains were drawn, 
nobody phoned you, the lights didn’t 
fail, you heard no noise. You went 
to bed and slept, the three of you, 
and it wasn’t until the next day 
that you discovered Shuteley had 
been burned to the ground. But we 
intervened, and — ” 

“And Jota still died,” I said. 
“That was what you, Greg, wanted 
— until a little while ago. When 
you lost your precious Gift you 
realized that somehow what was 
happening here tonight had snuffed 
the Gift out. It never developed. 
It was beaten here ... or else, 
who knows, the elements that en- 
abled it to be ‘beaten between your 
time and mine were brought to- 
gether.” 

“Yes,” Miranda murmured. 

“And you changed your mind 
completely,” I said to Greg. “Mir- 
anda was here to save Jota, you to 
make sure he stayed dead — be- 
cause both of you believed that 
Chat would weaken the Gift in 
your time. A little while ago, when 
you found you’d lost it, you de- 
cided, and perhaps you were ri^it, 
that Jota had to be saved. Save 
him, and maybe you saved the Gift 

145 




most of Greg’s 250 pounds behind 
it. It finished her interest in the 
contest at the moment it began. 

Greg had not taken time to take 
off his suit. The fact on the whole 
favored me. The plastic afforded 
him some protection, and he was 
hard to grasp properly. But the heat 
his efforts generated was trapped 
in the suit. I also guessed that the 
air supply from the tank at the 
back was constant, but not enough 
to sustain continued activity. 

Coming to the same conclusion 
as me, Greg tried to win grace to 
remove his suit. And I kept at him 
so that he couldn’t. Soon he was 
gasping like a grassed fish. 

He hit me once, and although it 
was only a glancing blow on my 
right breast, the pain and numb- 
ness that went through me showed 




me my only chance was either to 
hit Greg without being hit mysdt 
or to fight him as I had fought 
Iota. 

Using his weight, I brought off 
a knee-drop which hurt him badly. 
Nevertheless, it was perhaps a mis- 
take, for he got up so mad that I 
knew I was engaged in not much 
less than a fight to the death, per- 
haps nothing less at all. 

He couldn’t get his suit off. Every 
time he tried, I hit him or butted 
him or threw him. 

My tactics paid off, for when 
suddenly he caught me a stingmg 
blow on the side of the head and 
I reeled, defenseless for a moment, 
he chose to use the moment gained 
to get the suit off rather than to 
follow up his advantage. And that 
was a life for me. 

By the time he had stripped to his 
briefs I was able to go on. 

The trend of the struggle chang- 
ed. While he’d been wearing his 
suit there had been no point in 
trying to throw him through the 
stasis wall. Now there was. 

I was deliberately trying to do 
what I had done quite accidentally 
in Iota’s case — burn Greg to 
death. The blaze outside our bub- 
ble of coolness was dying now, and 
yet the embers were so hot that if 
Greg rolled out into them, he’d 
die as surely as Iota had. 

Unlike Iota, however, Greg knew 
what would happen. And he was 
trying to do the same to me. 

He threw me once, by brute 
strength, and then laun<hed himself 
at me, intending to win me with his 
weight. I rolled partly clear, but

ihc gralbbcd me and held me. He 
was on top» and 1 could do noth- 
ing about bis weiglhit. He started to 
swing at my head a blow which 
would have ended my interest in 
the fight. 

Then he fdl on top of me, limp. 
XXXI 

I extricated myself. Dina was 
standing over us. She had picked 
up a stone and hit Greg with it. 

‘‘Have I killed him?” she asked 
anxiously. 

“I don’t care if you have,” 1 
gasped. 

“I didn’t mean to kill him. But 
If 1 didn’t knock him out, he’d 
have taken the stone from me. So 
I had to hit pretty hard.” 

“You haven’t killed him, Dina,” 
I said, moving from Greg to Mir- 
anda, who was dazedly picking her- 
self up. I offered her a hand, but 
she shook her head and sat down 
again, taking a breather. Greg had 
been pretty rough with her that 
night. 

I turned back to Dina, who was 
a singularly attractive stranger. She 
wore a crisp white blouse which in 
the middle of all this was spotless, 
a short black skirt with a wide 
belt, nylons and stiletto shoes. She 
must have been fully protected from 
the be ginnin g. 

I asked her what had happened. 
“I was watching television with 
Barbara and Gil,” she said. “We 
heard shouting first. Then the tele- 
vision suddenly went off. And there 
was a glow at the window. The 
next thing, there was a glow at the 

‘l48 



other window. Gil shouted: ‘Get 
Garry, and we’ll go to the cellar.’ ” 

So that was how it had hap- 
pened. 

Before the giants intervened, when 
Barbara and Gh were alone in the 
house with Garry, Gil’s first re- 
action had been to seek refuge in 
the cellar. A very reasonable idea, 
really . the trouble was, he 
thought the fire that apparently 
surrounded them was an ordinary 
fire, and it wasn’t. In an ordinary 
fire, the cellar of Gil’s house would 
have been a perfect place. But 
in the fire that was to come, any 
cellar would become an oven, and 
anyone within would be baked slow- 
ly and very painfully to death. 

They had just reached the cellar 
when two. big youths in plastic suits 
appeared and practically dragged 
them back into the h^l of the 
house. Barbara, frightened, did ex- 
actly as she was told; Dina, curious, 
was glad to get out of the dingy 
cellar and have a chance of seeing 
what was happening; Gil, dazed, 
had to be shouted at before any- 
thing registered; and Garry slept 
peacefully through the whole thing. 

There had been a curious wait 
while people screamed outside, while 
crowds ran past the house, while the 
red glow became bright enough to 
replace the lights which had gone 
out. The youths in plastic suits didn’t 
speak, didn’t answer Barbara’s hys- 
terical questions. Yet they had a 
comforting air of knowmg exactly 
what they were doing. 

Unhimiedly they unwrapped a 
bundle and made Gil, Barbara, Dina 
and Garry put on fire-suits — the 

IF 




simpler version I had seen. And 
still they aJl waited. 

Then, quite suddenly, it was time 
to move. The giants gave the baby 
to Barbara, opened the door, and 
they moved out. 

It was indescribable — at any 
rate, Dina entirely failed to describe 
it. 

They walked along a street of 
fire. No one saw them because no- 
body not wearing a suit could be 
there to see them. They felt no 
heat, breathed easily and their eyes 
did not smart. 

They had, after all, only a few 
hundred yards to go. Before they 
realized it, they were in an area of 
comparative silence, complete calm, 
and cool, fresh air. 

'Fhe suits were at once taken 
from them. They would be used 
again and again that night. 

There were others in the stasis, 
many others — frightened, bewilder- 
ed people. More were brought in 
every moment, in plastic suits which 
were removed as they arrived. 

Beyond this point Dina knew 
little or nothing more, because then 
Miranda had appeared and taken 
her aside. 

“She gave me a pill,” said Dina. 
“And I fell asleep.” 

I looked past her at Miranda. 
That the giants had powers that 
were remarkable to us was un- 
deniable: that these powers were, 
after all, limited was equally clear. 

I could understand that Miran- 
da’s powers had been able to make 
of Dina a whole person for the 
first time in her life. But that this 
could be achieved merely by giving 



her a pill I just could not believe. 

Unseen by Dina, Miranda made 
a gesture. Its meaning was plain: 
she was telling me not to pursue 
this. 

Maybe she was right. I knew all 
I had to know. 

Looking at Dina, I marveled. She 
didn’t have any words she hadn’t 
had before; she didn’t have any ex- 
perience she had before. 

But . Dina was normal. She 
couldn’t have explained things as 
she had, understanding in retro- 
spect, unless she’d become some- 
thing much nearer an ordinary 17- 
year-old than she’d ever been. 

Dina had never before told me 
a long and fairly complicated story 
which I could understand. “She 
made me,” referring to Sheila, was 
about the most I could exp^t. 

“I’m grateful,” I said to Miranda, 
and I meant it. 

F eeling better, Miranda stood up. 

There was pain in her face, 
but only physical pain, and that 
was nothing. She glowed with hap- 
piness, relief, satisfaction. 

“Success by mistake,” she said. 
“It often happens. History is like 
that. We made dozens of mistakes 
and got the right answer. You mat- 
ter, Val, not Iota. Greg. ...” 

She shrugged, looking down at 
him. “I can handle him now.” 

“I wouldn’t be too sure,” I said. 
She was completely confident. 
“He knows now. He^ll be a dis- 
gruntled, dazed child when he comes 
round. He won’t give me any trou- 
ble. But now we have two suits — 
three suits. Val, take Dina and get 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS

out now. Greg and I will be all 
right. We’ll be snapped back with 
the stasis.” 

She smiled. “And have many, 
many chaldren. You and Sheila. And 
Dina. She may be involved, too. 
She may even be the one that mat- 
ters . no, it must be you. Yet 
Dina, too, didn’t have children be- 
fore, presumably, and will now — ” 

For Miranda it was over. Mission 
accomplished. She hadn’t failed after 
all, although, as she’d admitted, she 
had succeeded through luck and not 
much else. 

But for me it wasn’t over. I had 
still failed. I’d still get the lion’s 
share of the blame for the Great 
Fire of Shuteley. I’d still deserve 
a lot of it. The word mather would 
still go into the language. 

The kids Miranda wanted Sheila 
and me to have would grow up in 
an atmosphere of scorn. **Your old 
man's a murderer," They’d be chas- 
ed out of their playground at the 
break as Jota had once been chas- 
ed. And not just once. And some 
teachers would turn a blind eye. 

“No,” I said. 

“What do you mean, no?” 

“I’m not going to face a future 
like that. I’m not going to have 
kids to be picked on by the whole 
world.” 

The happiness died out of Mir- 
anda’s face, to be replaced by an 
anxious look. 

“Vay, you must! My world needs 
you and what you can do for it.” 

“Your world,” I said grimly, “is 
less to me than the destruction of 
Shuteley was to you. Far, far less.” 

Dina was looldng from Miranda 



to me, and back again, comprehend* 
ing very little of what was happen- 
ing, and yet comprehending sur- 
prisingly much. 

“I mean a lot to you,” I said. 
“You know it.” 

“More than you know.” 

“I’ve got a price.” 

“A price?” 

“Trinity Hall,” I said. 

he didn’t understand. 

“You told ime yourself,” I 
said. “If it weren’t for the Trinity 
Hall bit of the disaster, I’d have 
a chance. My kids would have a 
chance. Without Trinity Hall, the 
death roll in this terrible fire would 
be astonishingly light. The fire-safe- 
ty arrangements, if not fue pre- 
vention, would come out of it rath- 
er well. It’s facts that count after 
anything like this. Without the Tri- 
nity Hall 'tragedy it would be a 
shocking fire, sure, nobody would 
get any credit, but I wouldn’t be 
thrown to the lions. A few score 
people would have died in a fire 
that might have killed thousands. 
On the whole, I wouldn’t have done 
too badly. I might even keep my 
job.” 

“That’s all you’re thinking of 
— yourself?” Miranda said. “For 
all you’ve said, the fire is no more 
than a setback to yourself?” 

I laughed without humor. “My- 
self, Sheila, Dina, our kids and far 
more. The two hundred who were 
burned to death in Trinity Hall. If 
they’re not saved ... I don’t want 
to be saved either.” 

“You’re bluffing. You won’t stay 
here to die.”

“I will,” I said quietly. “I can’t 
speak for Dina. She can make up 
her own mind.” 

Dina said: “Val’s all I have. I 
think I understand what this is 
about. There are two hundred people 
you could save — ” 

“I can’t,” Miranda insisted. 

“Val thinks you can. ... I 
haven’t had much of a life. My 
memories are hazy — hut I know 
Val’s always done all he should for 
me, and maybe more. I’m grateful, 
too, for what you’ve done for me. 
I could have a wonderful life now. 
But it would be spoiled if I backed 
down here. This wasn’t my idea. 
I’d never have thought of it and 
I wouldn’t have done anything if I 
had. But now — if I saved myself, 
I’d be trading two hundred lives for 
mine.” 

“That’s nonsense,” Miranda said 
sharply. “Val, you know you don’t 
die. The river of time — ” 

“I’m sick to the back teeth of 
the river of time. I wanted explana- 
tions. Now I’ve had enough. Un- 
less you save the kids and old folk 
in Trinity Hall, I'm staying here, 
do you understand?” 

“In a suit,” said Miranda. “There 
are suits here. You’re bluffing. 
You’ll put them on, stay here 
and — ” 

She stopped as I picked up the 
three suits and walked to the wall 
of the stasis. She didn’t protest. 
She still thought I was bluffing. 

But when I threw the first one 
through, she screamed. 

The plastic was fireproof, but 
the breathing apparatus was not. 
And the suit was not sealed. 



M iranda pulled urgently at me. 

“Val, wait,” she begged. “You 
don’t understand. If you destroy the 
suits, you destroy all chance of get- 
ting what you want. Even if I did 
try to get something done about 
Trinity Hall, to do that I’d have 
to get back to the copse and speak 
to ... to the people in charge. I 
couldn’t leave here without a suit. 
So if you — ” 

I threw a second suit at the in- 
visible wall. It passed limply 
through and flared only sligjifcly, be- 
cause the material wouldn’t bum. 
But then the heat got at the oxy- 
gen in the breathing apparatus, and 
there was a minor explosion. 

I moved back from the stasis 
wall with Miranda. “Now we’re 
back where we started,’’ I said. 
“There’s one suit. Dina and I can’t 
both get out. You want to save us. 
If what you say is true, you have 
to save us. And the only way you 
can do that is save the people in 
Trinity Hall.” 

“They’ll never agree,” she said. 
“But you have agreed. You’re 
going to try.” 

“All right,” she said quietly. “I’ll 
try.” 

There was sudden frantic urgency 
after the long hours of inaction. In 
the army, you hurry up and wait. 
Or, sometimes,/ wait and huny up. 

I didn’t know what time dawn 
was, but it must ibe very soon now. 

While there had been nothing 
we could do, time had not mat- 
tered much. But suddenly it was of 
vital importance. Miranda tugged 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



151 




at the remaining fire-suit, fumbling 
in her haste. When she had it on, 
she didnt waste time in talk. S^e 
almost Tan through the stasis w^. 

“I don*t suppose you can ex- 
plain this to me, Val?” said Dina. 

*'l don^t suppose I can." 

"But you meant ah that about 
Trinity Hall? Two hundred people 
are dying there, and she can save 
them?” 

Dina had been sound asleep for 
hours. Her misconception of the 
situation was understandable. She 
didn’t know enough, understand 
enough, to realize that what I was 
demanding of Miranda was a change 
of history, an alteration in what 
had already happened. Dina took 
it for granted that if two hundred 
people could he saved, they must 
stih he ^ve. 

"Yes,” I said. 

Greg had not moved. I took a 
cursory glance at him; he was 
breathing, and the injury on his 
head was merely a bruise, tiiough 
a large one. He would recover all 
right. If he took his time about 
domg it, so much the better. Mir- 
anda 'believed that now she could 
handle him easily. I wasn’t so sure. 

"And ah we can do is wait?” 
Dina said. 

"All we can do is wait.” 

By this lime the town must 
be surrounded by half the firemen 
in England, and no doubt some 
progress in fighting the dying fire 
was ibeing made. Water turned to 
steam would be drawing off a lot 
of heat from the scorched ground. 

Was there a diance, I wondered, 
that we’d he saved anyway? If the 



firemen were able to fight their 
way into the ravaged town, if they 
got anyway near the sta^, we might 
live, independent of Miranda and 
the giiants. 

I found myself hoping desperate- 
ly. I wanted to live. I wanted Dina 
to live, now that she had some- 
thing to live for. 

M y grandstanding had been sin- 
cere enough. For selfish and 
unselfish reasons^ the issue for me 
had to come down to the fate of 
Trinity Hall and the people in it. 
I at least half believed that the 
giants couldn’t afford to avert the 
fire, that they couldn’t openly fight 
it, showing themselves fitting it, 
that perhaps they really had done 
all they could by secretly saving a 
few score o£ people whose bodies 
would not he missed. 

But somebody could easily have 
given the alarm at Trinity Hall. A 
stone through a window — failure 
of lights — smoke through the ven- 
tilation — a tap on a door — and 
all those people could he saved. I 
didn’t think Miranda’s river of time 
would ihe too much disturbed. 

I hadn’t told Miranda, perhaps 
I didn’t know then, all my own 
reasons for digging in my heels on 
this one thing. The really fundamen- 
tal one was my own feeling of 
responsibility. 

No, I h^n’t started the fire. 1 
hadn’t been careless or inefficient 
or venal. I had simply done my job 
the way I was told and expected to 
do my job. Nothing had been falsi- 
fied, nothing hidden. Even on Trini- 
ty Hall itself my conscience was 



152 



IF 




clear. Fire officers want to make 
sure, whaitever ithe cost. That’s th^ 
job. ImuraDce managers don’t want 
fire, don’t want to ihave to pay out, 
but they have to accept a calculated 
risk — that’s theirs. If there’s no 
fire risk, there can be no fire in- 
surance. 

Yet accident conceives and gives 
birth to blame. We know it hap- 
pened: why did it happen? Millions 
of stable doors have been slammed 
after horses have bolted. What real- 
ly happened in the library, any- 
way? In detail, Miranda didn’t know. 
Were the alarms severed or switched 
off? Or were the wires which operat- 
ed them burned or shorted by 
the fire itself? Nobody knew better 
than me that uhimatoly every addi- 
tional safety device meant some- 
thing more that could go wrong. 

Trinity Hall represented my hope 
of mental peace. If that didn’t hap- 
pen, if because of me that didn’t 
happen, I believed I could live with 
the rest. I could be blamed and 
feel in my heart that blame was 
unjust. A car driver who kills a 
child may never be able to get it 
out of his mind — but if he 
knows he was not at fault, he can 
live with it. 

If I’d been able to say to Mir- 
anda “save those people,” and she’d 
said “why of course, Val,” it would 
have been nothing. 

But I had to put up my own life. 
I valued it. I wanted it. I put up 
my stake, and I made sure I 
couldn’t wdch. 

If the Trinity HaH youngsters and 
old folk were saved, I could be 
saved. 



4 4 'That’s funny,” said Dina. 

^ I paid no attention, still 
wrapped in my thoughts. 

“It’s getting lighf,” she said* 

She was right and she was wrong. 
It was getting light, but it wasn’t 
funny. Not when the stasis dis^ 
pear^. 

It was Hell. 

Fierce heat swept across the vil- 
lage green. The fire outside, by 
comparison with what it had been, 
was a mere glow of dying embers. 

And yet. 

My bare flesh withstood the heat 
for a moment, until it dried and 
cracked. I couikl feel, or thought 1 
could fed, my blood beginning to 
boil. My hair crawled, and I felt it 
singeing. 

In those long seconds of burning 
to death we looked around, while 
we could still see, in an instinctive 
search for an avenue of escape. 
Men have found themselves in 
front of oven doors opened by mis- 
take ... for them, even if they die, 
the chance of flight, of saving them- 
selves, at least exists. The fire has 
a course and a direction. If the 
heat is lethal at seven feet it may 
not be at fourteen, fifty, two hun- 
dred. Escape is a possibility. 

But there was nowhere for us 
to go. The heat was all around us. 
The coolest place was and would 
continue to be where we were, 
practically in the center of what 
had recently been a haven in the 
conflagration. 

Dina’s white blouse slowly, stead- 
ily, went brown. 

Greg, without regaining con- 
sciousness, writhed and twisted like 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



153 




a plastic doll dirown into an open 
fire. 

We screamed. 

We couldn’t breatihe. The fire 
was using up all 4iie oxygen. 

Long before we died, we couldn’t 
see. 

We could still feel. 

I’d have been lucky, after all, 
to die on my own way through 
the ifiames with Greg. Iota had been 
lucky. Then, in the blinding heat 
of the fire at its height, death came 
instantly. 

Now it was slow, though no less 
sure. 

Slowly, but inexorably, I died. 

A nd came to life again. Of 
course. It was only to be ex- 
pected. With Miranda and the giants 
around, death wasn’t death and 
you could never be sure of Hfe. 

I still knew all that had hap- 
pened. I knew and would always 
know what it was like to burn to 
death in the mere backwash of a 
great fire. 

Now I was unbumed, as I had 
once before been unkilled. The stasis 
was still in position. Dina’s blouse 
was still white. And Greg was 
quietly snoring. 

Standing over me was Miranda, 
once more taking off her firesuit. 
She had dropped another at her 
feet. 

“Loops,” I said drunkenly, “are 
enough to make a man loop the 
loop.” 

“I was ten minutes too late,” Mi- 
randa said. “But this time I could do 
something about it.” She had a 
small machine in her hand. 



IF 




“Thank you v&y much,” I said. 
“Now we can go through the whole 
thing again. Because I’m still as de- 
termined — •’ 

“It’s done,” said Miranda. 

It took me several seconds to 
realize what she meant. 

“Trinity Hall?” I said at last. 

She nodded. “They agreed. Your 
life is necessary, Val. Perhaps Dina’s 
too, we don’t Imow. You had to be 
saved, far more than Jota had to 
be saved. In his case we guessed. 
In yours we know.” 

“The people in the hall?” I said. 

She shrugged. “We cut the elec- 
tric current. There was panic. One 
girl and one old man have broken 
aims. But they all got out. Now — 
you have fifteen minutes.” 

She could be lying, of course. She 
could be bluffing to get Dina and 
me away safely, quite powerless, 
once the giants removed themselves, 
to take the kind of action which 
could change the world. Once we 
saved ourselves, the chance of bar- 
gaining was gone. 

I didn’t think Miranda herself 
would lie. But she might easily have 
been told to return and do what 
she was doing, say what she was 
saying. 

I started putting on one of the 
suits. Dina, with a slight shrug, did 
the same. Miranda sighed in re- 
lief. 

“We’re going past Trinity Hall,” 
I said. “If the bodies are still there, 
I’m coming right back.” 

This didn’t worry Miranda. “As 
you like.” 

“You’ve got what you want?” I 
said. “You’re satisfied?” 

SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 




155 




“Yes.” 

“You’re sure?” I looked down 
at Gsreg, who lhad not moved. 

“Yes. In my worid there’s al- 
ready a big change. The Gift has 
disappeared. We don't iknow about 
the neutrals; maybe they’re not 
needed any more. Now hurry up 
and — ” 

The suits were on and sealed. 
“We’ll hurry,” I said. “Because I 
need time to get back here and 
take off my suit if necessary.” 

“Good^, Val,” said Miranda. 

Sbe tomed away. She didn’t 
speak to Dina. 

1 think at the last she was afraid, 
more afraid than she had ever been 
before, that something would hap- 
pen to wrest success from her grasp. 
She had never really expected suc- 
cess, not with Grpg a member of 
the party. Now she was a big win- 
ner, dazed, with the ticket in her 
hand, waiting for the result of 
an objectum. 

1 iMked down at Greg thought- 
fully. Though he had never done 
a diing to endear himseilf to me, 
I found myself rather sorry for him. 
I said so. 

“He’ll have psychiatric treat- 
ment,” Miranda said. “iBefore, he’d 
have refused it. Now he can’t.” 

‘Tfou think he’ll adjust?” 

“Why not? He’s only fourteen.” 

I blinked. I had never directly 
asked how old the giants were. 
1 knew Miranda was thirty, but 
she was their teacher. 

“And the others?” I said. “You 
said Greg was in a younger class, 
didn’t you?” 



“No. I said he was in a lower 
class. He’s not very bright, you 
know. The others are . they’re 
twelve.” 

She had not looked at me since 
she said good-by. 

And that was how I left her — 
terrified to speak to me again, to 
meet my eyes, in case I should say 
or do something that would bring 
everything tumbling about her ears. 

She even forgot to tell me to 
bury the suits afterwards. 

Dina and I made our way back 
through the dying fire. Trinity Hall 
was not easy to find: there was no 
pile of charred skeletons there any 
more. But we found it. I was satis- 
fied. 

We went past the castle and the 
dump. It was still pretty dark. Clear 
of the fire we took off our suits 
and bundled them in a piece of 
dirty sacking I found in the dump, 
beyond the fire area. 

Knowing something of the pro- 
gress of the fire, the giants bad 
chosen a quite perfect base for their 
doorway in time, the copse, and an 
equally perfect route to it. Even 
now, when there must be thousands 
of people round the ashpit that was 
Shuteley, we were able to walk out 
of the town and along the river 
to the copse without being seen. 
The only road or tracks were from 
the town, and they petered out at 
the dump and at Castle Hill. We 
did see a small party of men in 
blue suits examining the blockage 
of the river, but we were easily 
able to keep out of their sight. 

So they were all little ^ants of 
twelve, I thought. Well, it wasn’t 



156 



IF 




really astonishing. Already in 1966 
girls were developing at eleven in- 
stead of fourteen or fifteen, and 
at twelve they could be five feet 
six, 150 pounds and 39-24-37. Boys 
were slower, but that was coming 
too. 

Dina didn’t tadk, and I was glad. 
I’d been bludgeoned physically and 
mentally for forty hours or so. I’d 
killed a couple of people and been 
killed once m)^elf. I’d been shaken 
figuratively until my teeth rattled. 

I had felt too much or too little 
in the last forty hours. 1 hadn’t been 
a hero, I hadn*t been a villain. I 
hadn’t been very clever and I hadn’t 
been very stupid. 

But I was, I hoped and believed, 
ending up rather better than I had 
started. I was far more the master 
of my fate. 

We took the route along the bank 
that the giants must have taken. 
But there was no longer a bridge, 
and the boat was on the other side. 

"Well have to swim,” I said. 

Dina started taking off her 
clothes. 

"No,” I said. "We don’t want to 
leave anything here.” 

"il didn’t mean to leave my 
clothes. I’ll carry them.” 

"Just swim across as you are, 
Dina,” I said wearSy. 

5fee paid no attention. She took 
off her blouse, skirt, nylons and 
shoes and folded them into a neat 
bundle which she held dear of 
the water as die slipped into the 
river. 

In my exhausted state I came 
very close to an angry outburst, 
but managed to oheck it. This was 



the new Dina. She used to do 
exactly as I told her. Now I’d have 
to get used to her thinking for 
herself. 

I had a bundle, too, the fire- 
suits. 

I should have buried them that 
night. I should have done a lot 
of other things too. 

I didn’t do any of them. I simply 
took off nay pants, dried myself and 
went to b&d, not even bothering 
to find out what, if anything, Dina 
was doing, not thinking about Sheila 
beyond taking note that she hadn’t 
been back at the house. 

A n arm shook me firmly, in- 
sistently. I opened my eyes re- 
luctantly. It was 10:30 on the 
bedside clock. 

Sfttmg on my bed was a large, 
middle-aged man I didn’t know. Yet 
his face wasn^’t entirely unfamiliar. 

^‘Mr. Mathers,” he said, "I’m 
Chief Constable Wilson. Sorry to 
disturb you, but it’s important.” 
"Sheila?” I exclaimed, sitting up 
quickly. 

"Your wife is quite all right, Mr. 
Mathers. Doing a grand job, in 
fact. And I’ve seen your sister. She 
didn’t want to let me in, but I 
persuaded her.” 

I swung my legs out of bed. 

My nakedness on some other sum- 
mer might have sh^tly suiprised 
Wilson, As it was, it was nothing 
out of the ordinary. 

I put on a dressing gown. "What 
do you want?” I asked bluntly. 

"Forgive the intrusion,” he said. 
"There isn’t time to do tilings die 
usual way.” 



SNOW WHITE AND THE GIANTS 



157 




“Never mind that,” I said. “What 
do you want?” 

“I’m just getting the picture, Mr. 
Mathers. You know about the fire, 
of course?” 

“Yes.” 

He pantomined surprise, and 1 
thought: This man knows some- 
thing. 

“You did?” he said. “You might 
have slept right through it, out 
here. I’ve seen one or two fire ser- 
vice people, the police, of course, 
some of the people who es- 
caped. ...” 

“And now you’re seeing me.” 

“Yes. You haven’t been in touch 
with your company yet, have you?” 

“No.” 

He didn’t say anything about the 
fire being tragic, fantastic, incredi- 
ble. These things were said in the 
first few minutes, and then the sit- 
uation was taken for granted. 

“Well, first ... I gather you were 
out of town at a roadhouse when 
the fire began. You returned and 
found some firemen at the New 
Bridge. You gave them some ad- 
vice — good advice, I believe — 
and then your wife did some very 
useful work with homeless people. 
After that you disappeared for the 
rest of the night. What happened, 
Mr. Mathers?” 

Without warning I was faced with 
a choice I hadn’t foreseen. 

All through I had believed Mir- 
anda, on the whole. 

And now I faced the beginning 
of a situation which might mean 
ruin for Sheila and me and our 
children. Miranda said it did. I 
was going to be blamed for every- 



thing. My kids were going to grow 
up wanting to pretend I wasn’t their 
father. 

I’d saved two hundred people 
at the Trinity Hall, but nobody 
knew I had saved them. 

Chief Constable Wilson was not 
here to cast the first stone. He 
was simply, as he said, getting first 
impression of what had happened. 
He had heard what happened at 
the New Bridge, and perhaps that 
was all he had heard. He might 
easily have called on me merely 
because I had shown some presence 
of mind, had given Sheila a useful 
job to do, and had then gone off 
on my own, possibly with a pur- 
pose. 

But this was the start. 

I did not, however, have to let 
things simply take their course. 
I could take events by the scruff 
of the neck. If I did, it might mean 
ruin for Miranda’s world. Her river 
of time might be blasted into an 
entirely different course. It might 
not be the best thing for me either. 

Nevertheless. 

I opened a cupboard and took 
out the fire-suits. “Ever seen any- 
thing like these before?” I asked, 

T he die was cast. After I showed 
Chief Constable Wilson the fire- 
suits, I couldn’t have retreated if 
I’d wanted to. Certainly they were 
not impressive to look at, though 
the baffling way they adjusted to 
any human body and the still more 
baffling way in which they sealed 
and unsealed themselves without 
buttons or zips or adhesive woidd 
make anyone sit up and take notice. 



158 



IF 




But sooner or later somebody would 
test them in a fire, and then a big- 
ger fire — and would finally dis- 
cover that in such suits people 
could walk through a furnace. 

I didn’t want to draw back. 
Neither did I make any effort to 
advance. 

In the next few hectic hours I 
talked to a lot of people, of in- 
creasing importance — and I start- 
ed with the chief constable of the 
county. I didn’t see Sheila or Dina. 
Too many people wanted to ask 
me questions. 

1 told them about Maggie Hob- 
son and was the first to tell them 
she was dead. (It took days, of 
course, before even a prehminary 
casualty list could be drawn up.) I 
wasn’t really shifting blame from 
me to her; I was teBiiiig ^em what 
they were going to decide for them- 
selves. 

I told them a few more things 
about the fire, things I could not 
possibly have known in any way 
they considered “rational.” I did 
not admit, nor did I deny, that 1 
had been in Shutdey while the 
blaze was at its height They could 
handly make me 4dl them anything 
they refused to bdieve. 

About Miranda and the giants 
I preserved a reticence which en- 
sured that the most improbable 
facts were reluctantly accepted in- 
stead of rejected out of hand. I 
told them nothing; I admitted a 
few things undw pressure. 



But I did claim credit for Trinity 
Hall. I told them how the alarm 
was given, and hinted. • 

And before I saw Sheila, in the 
evening of the day after the Great 
Fire of Shutelcy, I knew that I’d 
made the right choice — for us. 

You can’t make a scapegoat of 
a man who knows more of the facts 
than anyone else. A man who knows 
things and you can’t figure out 
how he could possibly know them. 
A man who knows more than he 
will tell, unless you’ve worked out 
three-quarters of the answer first. 

Yes, for us Fd made the right 
choice. And perhaps for Shuteley, 
for my world. The knowledge, the 
unwilling certainty, that there had 
been something supernatural about 
the fhe made the whole thing easier 
to bear, to accept. For those who 
had lost people they loved, too, 
thane was hope. 

They might still be alive, some- 
where. 

But had I done die right thing 
for Snow White and the giants? 
Had they all ceased to exist — or 
had they found the Gift back among 
them, worse than ever before? Had 
1 dropped a billion hydrogen bombs 
on the woiki of 2197? 

Well, my attitude proved that I’d 
been doing Miranda and the giants 
an injustice afl along in finding 
them inhuman about our worid. 

Because about their world, I 
couldn’t care less.

Dear Editor: 

I tlunk that “Cordwainer Smith” 
is a pseudonym for a woman writer! 

About a year ago I remember 
reading in Galaxy (now, correct me 
if I am wrong) that Ck)rdwainer 
Smith — an anthropologist, I think 
— was on his way to Easter Island 
with some expedition. Later I read 
an article in Life about the same 
expedition, and I remember thinking 
at the time that 1 might get to see 
what Cordwainer Smith looked like. 
But no luck. The only anthropologist 
mentioned was a woman, whose 
name I can’t remember. (She was 
known to the natives as “Mrs. Tell 
Me Three Dreams That Have Had 
Some Meaning to You.”) 

Then in the letter column of the 
May If Irvin Koch asked if Cord- 
wainer Smith was a pseudonym and 
you answered that it was. Suddenly 
all the pieces fell together like a 
jigsaw puzzle. Cordwainer Smith 
and the woman anthropologist are 
one and the same person! 

Would you please let me know if 
I am right or wrong? The suspense 
is killing me! 

(By the way, I got so heated up 
with my Sherlock-Holmesing that 
I forgot to tell you that I really 



like your magazine! If you keep 
up this habit of overlapping all 
those great serials and publishing 
a stack of other great stories be- 
sides, you have got the next Hugo

# No, your reasoning is exemplary, 
but your conclusion didn’t quite 
make it. Cordwainer Smith was a 
pseudonym for Professor Paul Line- 
barger, of Johns Hopkins Univer- 
sity. For years his identity was 
one of the most closely guarded 
secrets in science fiction — partly 
because of the fact that his posi- 
tion as a consultant to the U. S. 
State Department made discretion 
essential, partly because he wrote 
science fiction for relaxation and 
felt that he would not be able to 
do it any more if his identity were 
known. 

Last month (as this is written), 
after a long illness. Paul Linebarger 
died in Washington, D.C. For this 
reason we can now disclose his 
identity — but that is small com- 
pensation for the loss of a valued 
friend and a brilliant and original 
writer. — Editor,

Dear Editor: 

In regard to the relativistic dilem- 
ma you posed in the Juiie, 1966, 
issue, your statements are basically 
correct in that it would require an 
infinite amount of energy to prox>el 
an object with a i>ositive rest mass 
up to the speed of light because 
as it approaches the speed of light 
it acquires infinite mass. The falla- 
cy in the dilemma is that light at 
rest (photons) has no mass. Thus, 
theoretically, it requires no energy 
to raise the massless photons up to 
sub-light speeds and only finite 
energy to propel them to the speed 
of light; this eneigy being con- 
verted into the apparent mass of 
the light. 

In regard to the remarks made 
in the June Hue and Cry con- 
cerning racial differences, 1 would 
like to add my two bits. The white 
man has certain obvious psysical 
characteristics which are superior 
to the Negro, whereas the Negro 
has certain others superior to the 
white man. This is also true in the 
pathological, and probably also true 
in the mental aspects of not only 
these two races but all the races 
of man. As soon as we do obtain 
^'roughly equated” environments for 
the different races and can deter- 
mine each race’s mental superiori- 
ties then sometime in the future it 
may be possible to breed a better 
man Incorporating all the best fea- 
tures of the different races. To 
say this, or anything else, is im- 
possible at ithe rate of our present 
technological and sociological ad- 
vancement is to stand on very un- 
steady ground. 

I have read the World of NulUA 
by Van Vogt and am very much 
interested in reading its aerial. If 
it has been published in paper or 



hard back, where and how much, 
or if not, how can I igo about ob- 
taining a oopy. Oh, as an after- 
thought, I might add that I consider 
If the best science fiction maga- 
zine on the market today. The Moon 
is a Harsh Mistress is Heinlein’s 
grreatest novel to date, and that is 
really saying something, and Earth- 
blood is great. I can hardly wait 
for the upcoming novels in If. — 
Alfred Baker, 1822 Lawson Lane,

Dear Editor: 

Although he and I concur on two 
points, the respective merits of 
Podka/yne of Mars and FarnhanCs 
Freehold, I must take exception to 
Sten D'^lskcg’s treatment of what 
I consider Heinleiia^s best novel to 
date. Mr. Dahlskog says that even 
if it were kept in that most horrible 
of literary forms^ the first-person 
narrative, (which 1 happ^ to like), 
the novel would (have been far bet- 
ter if it were ‘‘writteaL" by Wyoh, 
Prof or Stu, instead of by Mannie. 
What he doesn’t realize is that the 
central character is not one of the 
“B”cell comrades, or Stu. As a mat- 
ter of fact, the c^itral character 
isn’t even human; on the contrary, 
it is MIKE ! Without this autocog- 
nitive computer to make predictions, 
keep security, and formulate strate- 
gy, the revolution eouM never have 
started, much less succeeded. Also, 
if you remember the conclusion of 
the story, only Mannie could have 
written it. 

1 say this because, as Mr. Dohl- 
skog himself notes, ihe other three, 
(really TWO: Temember, Stu never 
met Mike, just **Adam Selene”!), 
were more concerned with people, 
while Mike was a computer. In fact.

Dear Editor: 

First let me congratulate Worlds 
of If on winning the “Hugo” at the 
Tricon in Cleveland. It was most 
deserved ! 

At the Tricon a number of your 
readers, myself included, were dis- 
cussing the formation of a science- 
fiction radio “ham” net. This con- 
sists of readers who are also radio 
amateurs, who would like to dis- 
cuss sf across the country via the 
airwaves. 

I thought perhaps some of your 
readers might like to join us in 
forming the net. If so, they could 
send their names and call letters to 
me and 1*11 take it from there. 
Thanks. — Christine Haycock, M.D.,

Dear Editor: ' 

Re: The editorial for the Aug- 
ust *66 issue of If: 

Yes, it os a shame Mariner IV 
came along! It not only spoiled 
theories dear to some hearts, it also 
upheld one theory — one that had 
been ridiculed, vilified and ostra- 
cized from most public and scienti- 
fic commundoation channels. 

I refer, of course, to the theories 
of Dr. Immanuel Vedikovsky, author 
of Worlds in Collision, etc,, in 
which he detailed — and Mariner 
IV confirms — the description of 
a “dead** planet Mars and the cause 
of its destruction . the collision 



between it and the protoplanet 
(comet) Venus ... 

The present writer thinks that 
the many recent confirmations of 
Dr. Velikovsky*s theories augurs 
well the need for a reassessment of 
his works and their implications for 
the future. — Robert Stephanos,

Dear Editor: 

We would just like to express 
our great enjo 3 mient of Fred Saber- 
hagen*s beserker tales. We can hard- 
ly wait until the next installment 
of his saga. When will some enter- 
prising publisher persuade him to 
gather all the stories under one 
cover? It*s quite a pleasure to watch 
a writer improve and mature as 
Saberhagen has. Stories with strong 
moral themes are all too rare. Your 
efforts to discover and encourage 
new taints are to be commended. 
We are graduate students at the 
University of Illinois and have both 
been reading science fiction since 
high school. — John and Sandra

Dear Editor: 

Neutron Stcur by Larry Niven was 
the first science-fiction story I*ve 
ever really enjoyed. I also would 
like to say that Michael Walker did 
an exceptional job in Your Soldier 
Unto Death. 

I have read parts of several past 
issues which my friend happened 
to enjoy. All around I will say that 
If is one of the best science fiction 
magazines I have ever read and I 
shall continue to buy your If pub- 
lications monthly. — Thomas Green,

SKCUl OFFER TO SCIENQ FICTION FANS 



Foundation Trilogy 



"Dy 12,067 it was clear that the massively cor- 
rupt Galactic Empire was near total col- 
lapse. Its myriad worlds had already begun to 
war among themselves, plunging the universe 
into barbaric chaos. Civilization seemed doomed. 

But master scientists laboring to ensure that 
civilization would be preserved during the dark 
ages to come, established twin “Foundations” at 
opposite ends of the Galaxy, to form the nueleui 
of a new civilization, and in time to unite across 
the Galaxy to form a new ... a stronger ... a 
more enduring Second Empire. 

In Foundation and Foundation and Empire, 
we follow the course of the First Foundation as 
it rekindles the light of civilization in an ever- 
increasing portion of the Galaxy — and as it in 
confronted by its greatest crisis: a dang^erous 
mutant, an evil yet brilliant pnyckopath who$e 
aoul-eon$uming deaire is conquest of the Galaxy! 

Within a decade, he tyrannized the entire 
Galaxy — except for the Second Foundation. 
And this became his mania — to find and conquer 
the Second Foundation. Everything in the 
Galaxy must be his! ... 



^ HIS brilliantly exciting chronicle of th^ world of the future 
combines three great science fiction classics for the first 
time in one huge volume. FOUNDA TIOS . FOUSDATION 
and EMPIRE ... and SECOND FOUNDA TION are among 
the most thought-provoking, compelling epics ever to come 
from- the pen of the distinguished research biochemist and 
leading science fiction writer, Isaac Asimov.
