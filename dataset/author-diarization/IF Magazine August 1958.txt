Escape lay two thousand frightening miles ahead of them — 


a lonely, cowering band of loyalists led by a renegade. En 


route, some must die, while one man must try another road .

two of the moons were in the bleak Half a block to the north a gray- 
twilight sky. clad figure appeared, carrying a

swinging torch to light his way 
through the gathering gloom. Mac- 
intyre recognized the figure as one 
of Lumley’s Truthmen, out on a 
prowl in search of enemies of the 
state. Macintyre stared bitterly at 
the chunky advancing figure; then, 
realizing his danger, he hurried 
down the street he still called Jef- 
ferson Street. 

He moved silently and swiftly. 
He was used to running. It had 
been a hard life, these two years 
since the Decree of Separation. 
Macintyre had surprised himself 
then by remaining loyal to the 
mother world. In the succeeding 
two years he had continued to sur- 
prise himself by surviving Lumley’s 
persecution of the dwindling Loyal- 
ists. 

He reached the alleyway between 
Numbers 322 and 324 Jefferson, 
glanced round once to make sure 
the coast was clear, and ducked 
through. He scaled a low fence, 
trotted over a much-trampled back- 
yard garden, and slipped into a 
beckoning opening in the. ground. 
Instantly the door closed behind 
him, and a familiar voice said, “We 
were worried about you. You’re a 
half hour late.” 

“Couldn’t help it,” Macintyre 
said. He was hoarse; he poured 
himself a glass of water from the 
tap in the comer. Familiar faces 
surrounded him : nine frightened 
men. All the Loyalists left in May- 
nard City. There are so jew of us 
left , Macintyre thought . And is it 
worth it , all the running and hid - 
ing? 

It was a strange group, these 
remnants of the Loyalist Party. Nor- 

4 


man Maynard, great-great-great- 
grandson of the man who had dis- 
covered this world — Norman May- 
nard, a ratty-looking little man with 
ulcers. Vitello, once a dramatist, 
who now looked like a ragpicker. 
Christie, once Professor of Terran 
History at Maynard University, 
enamored of his own textbooks and 
unable to relinquish loyalty to the 
mother world. Bryson. Hallert. 
Fugitives. 

“Well?” Maynard demanded. 
“What did you find out? Did you 
see the proclamation? Is it true?” 

Macintyre nodded. “I saw the 
proclamation. It’s posted in half a 
dozen places downtown. Everything 
we were told is true.” ^ 

He crossed the room and sat 
down on the battered old couch. 
He stared at his too- thin, too- 
sensitive hands. “According to the 
proclamation, every citizen of the 
Free World of Maynard must 
carry with him at all times a card 
declaring he has sworn the Oath of 
Allegiance to the Republic. Without 
taking the oath you can’t hold 
citizenship. And then at the bottom 
of the proclamation it says that for 
the duration of the emergency jury 
trial is suspended and all non-cit- 
izens are under automatic sentence 
of death.” Macintyre looked up. 
“That’s all there is. Either get your- 
selves a card or be ready to run, and 
run fast.” 

The room was very quiet. Finally 
Vitello said, “What do we do now?” 

“What do you think we do?” 
Hallert demanded. He was a thin 
watery-eyed man who had been 
Secretary of Outworld Relations in 
the last Loyalist cabinet. “Either we 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 



go down to the post office and swear 
allegiance to Lumley, or we stay 
here and wait for them to flush us 
out. It can’t take long. Either way 
our course is pretty simple.” 

“We could call Ritterheim and 
accept his offer,” said Christie in 
a mild voice. 

Nine pairs of eyes focussed sud- 
denly on the ex-Professor of Terran 
History. Macintyre felt a muscle in 
his cheek begin to twitch. He had 
been thinking along the same lines 
himself, ever since he had seen the 
proclamations posted in Govern- 
ment Square. Ritterheim was their 
only hope. Ritterheim was their sole 
chance. 

But there were uncomfortable 
truths to be faced if they were to 
accept Ritterheim’s offer. And it 
was not epsy for a man to face those 
truths. 

Macintyre’s mind drifted back to 
the day — was it only three days 
ago? — when the radio set in the 
corner of their hideout had come 
bleeping to life. Bryson, the elec- 
tronics technician who had built the 
set during the days when there still 
was some talk of a Loyalist counter- 
revolution and hence some need of 
communication between the bands 
of fugitives, sprang to the controls. 

The call had come via subradio 
from the neighboring world of Hax- 
ley — a world staunchly Loyalist, one 
which had flatly refused to take part 
in the Separatist uprising. Charles 
Ritterheim, Haxley Minister of 
Foreign Affairs, was calling. He had 
learned that the Separatist govern- 
ment on Maynard was soon to pub- 
lish a declaration prescribing the 
death penalty for any remaining 

THE WAGES OF DEATH 


Loyalists. Would they, Ritterheim 
wanted to know, care to flee to 
Haxley and take sanctuary there? 

“How would we get there?” Bry- 
son asked. 

“There’s a ship of ours ready to 
leave Maynard now,” Ritterheim 
said. “A mercantile ship. We’re 
putting down at Dillard Spaceport 
on the 19th of the month. If there 
happened to be a dozen or so Loyal- 
ists in the area at that time, we 
might look the other way.” 

“But Dillard’s two thousand miles 
from here,” Bryson objected. 
“Couldn’t you arrange a landing 
somewhere closer to us? The 
dangers of a continental crossing — ” 
“I’m sorry. But we’re booked in 
at Dillard. I’m afraid that a landing 
anywhere else would be construed 
as an act of war by the Maynard 
government, and we’re not anxious 
to go to war with your friend Lum- 
ley just yet. Well? Will your group 
be at Dillard on the 19th?” 

“I — don’t know. There are so 
many aspects we have to con- 
sider — ” 

“Very well,” Ritterheim said, a 
trifle coldly. “Consider them. Our 
offer still goes, if you’re interested. 
Call me back within a week or else 
forget about it.” 

B RYSON had discussed the con- 
versation with them. For two 
days and two nights the group had 
considered it; on a purely theoreti- 
cal level, of course, since no official 
word had come down about a death 
penalty for Loyalist beliefs. Finally 
Macintyre had volunteered to leave 
the shelter arid try to discover if 


5 



any such proclamation had been 
made. 

It had. 

The choices were clear-cut now. 

They could abandon the last 
shred of loyalty to Earth, admit that 
Lumley’s government was de jure 
as well as de facto in control of 
Maynard, and swear allegiance. Of 
the thirty million people of May- 
nard, all but a few hundred had 
done so. Lumley promised imme- 
diate amnesty for any recusants who 
swore allegiance. 

Or they could take the opposite 
stand, and remain in hiding, sur- 
reptitiously writing and spreading 
pamphlets opposing the Separatist 
movement, urging a return to affili- 
ation with Earth. But that was the 
way of martyrdom. 

Ritterheim offered a third alter- 
native — flight. They could take 
sanctuary on Haxley and wait there 
for the inevitable moment when the 
forces of Earth would exact venge- 
ance on Lumley for his treason 

j 

against the mother world. 

Round and round and round the 
discussion went, as it had almost 
constantly since the moment Ritter- 
heim’s call had come through. Mac- 
intyre watched silently, feeling curi- 
ously detached from himself. He 
flexed his fingers. He wished he 
could sculpt this group, mold its 
confusions in living plastic, express 
in tangible form the cross-currents 
of bewilderment and cowardice that 
his nine comrades were creating. 
But it was more than a year since 
he had last worked at his art ; these 
troubled times had no use for poets 
or painters or sculptors. 

Naturally, none of the group ad- 


vanced the suggestion that they give 
up and swear the Oath. They were 
too deeply committed for that; this 
was the hard core of the Loyalist 
movement, and for them there was 
no turning back. 

But yet it was hard for them to 
accept Ritterheim’s offer. Macin- 
tyre listened as the stale, insincere 
arguments were advanced one by 
one: that it was cowardly to flee, 
that our work demanded that we 
stay here and continue the fight on 
the home world, that it would be 
betraying our ideals — 

Finally Macintyre grew tired. 
Putting some edge in his voice for 
the first time in weeks, he said, 
“Gentlemen, may I speak ? 15 

Startled by the authority in his 
voice, they grew quiet. Macintyre 
looked around at them. 

“We’ve been discussing this mat- 
ter for three days, friends. At least, 
you have. I’ve just been listening. 
But now I want to talk. 

“The prevailing sentiment among 
you seems to be that we should turn 
down Ritterheim’s offer, stay here, 
and go gloriously to our deaths 
whenever Lumley’s Truthmen hap- 
pen to stumble over our little hide- 
out. You, Hallert, and Maynard 
over there — you’ve been holding out 
for martyrdom, haven’t you? You 
think it’s noble. Do you mind if I 
tell you what’s really on your 
minds?” 

“Hold on, there, Macintyre,” 
Maynard broke in roughly. “If you 
think—” 

“I don’t think anything. Shut up 
and listen.” Macintyre locked his 
hands together. “You’re picking 
martyrdom because it’s the easy way

ROBERT SILVERBERG 



out. We can t go back; we’re too far 
out on the limb to turn around and 
swear allegiance to Lumley. It 
sounds paradoxical, but doing that 
requires real courage, the kind none 
of us has. The courage to admit we 
might have been wrong all along.” 

“Are you suggesting, Tom, that 
Lumley’s right and we’re wrong?” 
Christie asked. 

“Of course not. I’m just as firmly 
pro-Earth as any of you. What I’m 
saying is that none of us, myself in- 
cluded, would ever have the guts to 
admit Lumley was right, if we ever 
began thinking so. Okay. So the 
only paths open for us are staying 
on Maynard, which means inevi- 
table execution, or fleeing to Hax- 
ley, which means we may live to 
fight some other day. And you all 
seem to be holding out for staying 
here and going gloriously to the gas 
chamber. How damned brave!” 

Macintyre stared bitterly at the 
nine puzzled faces and felt a cur- 
rent of excitement welling up inside 
him. He had never spoken this way 
before, never felt the urge to get up 
on his back legs and tell people 
what lay behind their pretences. 

Only now his life was at stake, his 
and all theirs — and he didn’t intend 
to give it up easily. 

“You know why you’re all so keen 
on letting Lumley execute you?” he 
asked. “Not because you feel your 
misSion is here on Maynard. No. 
The gas chamber is an easy way 
out, a noble way out. It’s an end to 
struggle, and it’s a praiseworthy end 
in the eyes of others. It’s a way of 
giving up. 

“So you want to turn down Rit- 
terheim. That’s interesting. Tell me 

THE WAGES OF DEATH 


this: suppose Ritterheim offered to 
put a ship down in our back yard 
and take us all away to Haxley? 
Would you turn him down then? 
Like hell you would! You’d 
scramble aboard that ship so fast — " 

Hallert was white-faced. He 
seemed ready to explode. Macintyre 
stood up and pointed. “I’m almost 
done. I just want to say one more 
thing. The reason you all want to 
turn Ritterheim down — me, too, I 
feel that way — is that you all want 
to stay here in this cozy cellar until 
you’re caught. You know that Dil- 
lard Spaceport is two thousand 
miles from here, and you’re scared 
stiff of making the trek. It takes 
courage to run halfway across a 
continent, even if you’re only run- 
ning away.” 

He sat down and looked at his 
hands again. They were trembling. 
His face was flushed. No one was 
saying anything. After a while he 
looked up at them. One minute 
went by, and another, and still no 
one spoke. 

“I take it from your silence that 
you agree with me. I expected it. 
Hell, I’m enough like you to know 
what’s in your minds — only I threw 
it out in the open to show you.” 

“You know we’d never survive a 
trip across the continent,” Vitello 
said reproachfully. “We’re soft, 
Tom. We can’t kill men. We can’t 
lie very well. We can’t fight back. 
We wouldn’t get more than ten 
miles before they found us out. Isn’t 
it better to stay here and try to 
spread our pamphlets than to go to 
certain death on the trek to Dil- 
lard?” 

“We could make it,” Macintyre

said. “Even a bunch of soft-headed 
arty types like ourselves. All we 
need is a guide. A shepherd, you 
might say. Someone to keep the 
wolves away — a strong man.” 

“Are you suggesting yourself?” 
Bryson asked. 

Macintyre blinked. “Are you kid- 
ding? I’m no tougher than any of 
you, despite my size and the way I 
just spoke. No. I’ve got a man in 
mind, though. His name is Wallace. 
He’ll take us to Dillard for a fee, 
and he’ll see to it we get there 
alive.” 

Vitello’s sensitive features wrin- 
kled in distaste. “A mercenary, you 
mean?” 

Macintyre nodded. “Call him 
that, if you like. He isn’t a pleasant 
sort. But he’ll get us there. Any- 
body interested in the deal?” 

OR THE SECOND time that 
day, Macintyre left the shelter 
of the hideout — this time bearing 
the task of locating Wallace and 
offering him the job. 

They had been unwilling, at first, 
just as Macintyre himself had been 
unwilling to bring the matter up. 
Wallace was known by name and 
by reputation to most of them. He 
was a freebooter, a footloose mem- 
ber of the mercenary class that had 
sprung up on Maynard during its 
three centuries of existence as a 
Terran colony. He had the reputa- 
tion of being willing to do anything 
— for a price. 

But as Macintyre had won his in- 
ward battle, so did he convince his 
friends that hiring Wallace was es- 
sential to their survival. They were 


surely doomed if they remained in 
Maynard City; just as surely, they 
would never reach Dillard Space- 
port alive on their own exertions. 
With Wallace, they stood a chance. 

Macintyre headed northward to 
the bar where Wallace spent much 
of his free time. All three of May- 
nard’s moons had risen, now, and 
the streets were uncomfortably 
bright. Macintyre’s throat felt dry. 
There was a bounty of $100 on his 
head — no fortune, but enough to 
make it worthwhile for someone 
recognizing him to turn him in to 
the Truthmen. 

He paused outside the bar, peer- 
ing in. He made out Wallace’s face; 
the mercenary was sitting alone, 
near the back. Macintyre shattered 
the photonic beam and stepped 
through the opening door. 

It seemed to him that the hum of 
conversation in the bar dropped off 
perceptibly as he came in. For a 
moment he heard no sound but the 
raucous wailing of the musicbox; 
then the interrupted conversations 
were resumed. Macintyre made his 
way toward the back, toward Wal- 
ls ce 

“Mind if I sit down here?” he 
asked. 

The mercenary looked up. He 
was a broad-faced man, heavy- 
bearded, with deepset dark eyes and 
a thick sprawling nose. A pale scar 
lanced diagonally across his left 
cheek, beginning at the tip of the 
jawbone and terminating a fraction 
of an inch from his eyeball. 

“You better have a good reason 
for it,” Wallace growled. 

“I do.” Macintyre slipped into 
the seat. “You know who I am?”

ROBERT SILVERBERG 



“I know your politics, friend. Not 
your name. What are you drink- 
ing?" 

“Ale,” Macintyre said. Wallace 
ordered a mug. Macintyre stared 
closely at the other’s seamed face. 
“My name is Tom Macintyre,” he 
said slowly. “That bit of infor- 
mation is worth a hundred dollars 
to you, cash on the line, if you feel 
like yelling for a Truthman.” 

“I’ve been thinking that very 
thing, Mr. Macintyre. I don’t know 
what you want with me, but it bet- 
ter be worth more than the price on 
your head.” 

“It is.” Macintyre took a deep 
sip. The ale was cold, dark, and 
potent. “I’ve got a job for you. It 
involves acting as a sort of guide for 
ten Loyalists, including myself. We 
have to be at Dillard Spaceport by 
the 19th of the month.” 

Wallace nodded. “Dillard’s a 
couple of thousand miles from here. 
And today’s the 8th.” 

“There’s plenty of time, if we 
leave immediately,” Macintyre said. 
“Interested?” 

“Maybe.” 

“How much would it be worth 
to you?” 

Smiling, the mercenary said, “I 
could sell the lot of you to the 
Truthmen for a thousand dollars. 
You better outbid that by plenty.” 
Macintyre moistened his lips. 
“Two thousand five hundred is 
what we offer. How does that 
sound?” 

“In cash?” 

“In cash. One thousand down 
immediately, fifteen hundred more 
when and if we reach Dillard safely 
and on time. I’m talking in hard 

THE WAGES OF DEATH 


money, Galactic crown pieces, not 
Lumley scrip.” 

Wallace looked thoughtful. He 
intertwined thick, stubby fingers, 
coughed, scowled. “I don’t know 
how much I like doing business with 
Loyalists. How come you need a 
guide, anyway? Can’t you find your 
way to Dillard by yourselves?” 

Macintyre went red; he felt his 
cheeks steaming. With an effort, he 
forced the words out: “We don’t 
think we can make it ourselves. It’s 
a dangerous trip. We’re peaceful 
men. We — ” He stopped. He heard 
voices just behind his back. 

“That’s Macintyre,” someone 
said, in a dull menacing tone. “Go 
get a Truthman. We’ll split.” 

Macintyre half-rose; Wallace’s 
hand shot out, caught his wrist, 
dragged him back down into his 
seat. From somewhere a gleaming 
little needlegun appeared in the 
mercenary’s hand. Quietly Wallace 
said, “You stay right here and let 
the Truthmen alone, chum. You’re 
making a big mistake. This man’s 
name isn’t Macintyre. It’s Smith. 
Theodore H. Smith. And he’s a very 
good friend of mine.” 

Instantly tension subsided in the 
bar; the would-be informer tossed 
a surly look at Wallace and van- 
ished into the crowd. Wallace 
smiled coldly at Macintyre. 

“Don’t let these ruffians upset 
you, Mr. — ah — Smith . I can under- 
stand how someone of your delicate 
sensibilities can get ruffled by talk 
like that.” Wallace grinned sav- 
agely. “Back to business, now. One 
thousand now, one and a half later. 
I think I’ll accept, Mr. Smith. It 
ought to be a very amusing trip.”

T HEY LEFT in the cold gray 
hours just before dawn, after 
Bryson had put through a call to 
Haxley to let Ritterheim know they 
were accepting the offer of sanctu- 
ary. It was at that vague time when 
the moons had set and the sun was 
still below the horizon, when a 
ghostly pale light illuminated the 
rain-washed streets. 

Macintyre felt a dull sense of re- 
gret as the little party of eleven set 
out. Up ahead of them, swaggering 
a little, Wallace led the way; in his 
pocket were ten crown pieces, each 
of them worth ten eagles — one 
thousand dollars of their money. 
Fifteen hundred more awaited him 
at completion of the journey. 

To be reduced to this, Macintyre 
thought — to hiring a man like Wal- 
lace, a paid killer, a man with the 
morals of a snake and the muscles 
of an ape — that hurt more than 
anything. There he was, and on him 
their lives depended. 

It was all part of the pattern, the 
pattern that had begun when 
Claude Lumley first appeared on 
the Maynard political scene. Before 
Lumley, all had been well. Maynard 
was one of the eighty-six Earth-type 
worlds strung through the galaxy. 
It corresponded to Earth-norm 
within two decimal places. It had a 
population of thirty million Terran- 
descended settlers. And until Lum- 
ley, it had been unquestioningly 
loyal to the mother world. 

The ties had been mild ones. 
Earth required that a Resident Ad- 
viser live on a colony world and 
aid in planetary administration ; 
that a token sum be paid in taxes 
to the mother world each year; that 

10 


the colony grant certain trifling 
trade privileges to Earth. At one 
time the relationship had been of 
great significance to Earth, but the 
centuries had passed, and the col- 
onies had evolved into self suffi- 
ciency, while Earth herself no 
longer had need of the sort of socio- 
cultural stimulus colonizing af- 
forded. The relationship became 
one of purely symbolic value, a ges- 
ture of gratitude toward the world 
that had first sent its peoples forth 
to the worlds of the galaxy. 

As a symbol, it was a loved thing. 
No one grudged the pittance paid in 
taxes, and no one objected to the 
presence of a Resident Adviser so 
long as he performed a purely cere- 
monial function. The peoples of the 
colony worlds maintained a warm 
and pleasant mock-subservience to- 
ward the mother world. One took 
for granted the fact that a certain 
amount of respect was due the 
parent planet. 

Until Lumley. The ambitious 
young politician had been swept 
into the Chancellorship of Maynard 
by a landslide vote — and had 
promptly announced that he in- 
tended to discontinue paying the 
tithe to Earth. 

Resident Adviser Humphries had 
objected on grounds of tradition, 
and Lumley had seized his chance. 
Ordering Humphries back to 
Earth on charges of wanton inter- 
ference with local sovereignty of 
Maynard, Lumley declared the 
planet a Free World, owing no 
further allegiance to Earth, setting 
forth in his Decree of Separation 
the doctrine that the tie with Earth 
was a potentially unhealthy one that 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 



should be severed before it became 
diseased. 

There was an immediate uproar 
of protest from the people of May- 
nard — but a surprising volume of 
agreeing voices was audible. Slowly 
the force of opinion swung toward 
Lumley. Earth herself made no 
comment on Lum ley’s rash decree, 
and many on Maynard took Earth’s 
silence for assent. The Separatists 
were a minority one day, a roaring 
majority the next. 

There were those who objected, 
Macintyre among them. The artists, 
the poets, the sculptors, the teach- 
ers — gentle people, most of them, 
who valued the old traditions and 
were not anxious to see them die. 
They proclaimed continuing loyalty 
to Earth, and urged Lumley to re- 
tract his decree. 

It was only natural that Lumley 
should regard these protests as di- 
rect attacks on his regime. He in- 
itiated a campaign to bring about 
100% acceptance of the Decree of 
Separation, and when more than 
three-fifths of the population had 
sworn allegiance to the new govern- 
ment he pushed through the first of 
the anti-Loyalist laws. 

It became punishable by $500 
fine and thirty days’ imprisonment 
to publicly advocate restoration of 
the relationship with Earth. Most of 
the wavering Loyalists yielded and 
took the Oath; others went de- 
fiantly to prison, emerging with 
their opinions unchanged. 

Gradually the anti-Loyalist laws 
became more stringent, and the 
Loyalist numbers dropped away. 
Two years after his accession, Lum- 
ley dared to make Loyalism pun- 

THE WAGES OF DEATH 


i&hable by death — but by that time 
only a few hundred remained on all 
of Maynard, and those few re- 
mained well hidden. 

And it had come to this, now, 
Macintyre thought. The last few 
of us in the capital city of Maynard, 
fleeing desperately to another world, 
being shepherded to safety by a 
ruthless killer who laughs at our 
ideals but who willingly takes our 
money. 

He wiped rain from his face and 
brows and glanced up ahead. Wal- 
lace set a steady pace, down the Old 
River Road that led out of May- 
nard City via the South Bridge. He 
was a big man, this Wallace, broad- 
shouldered and heavy-muscled, but 
Macintyre knew he himself was 
just as big, perhaps even an inch 
taller, five pounds heavier. Bigger 
on the outside, that was. 

Wallace carried less of a load, 
though. He was not weighted down 
with things like scruples or ethics or 
second thoughts. And that was why, 
thought Macintyre with a trace of 
bitterness, Wallace was leading the 
party and he was slinking along in 
the rear. 

It was two thousand miles south- 
east to Dillard, second largest city 
of the planet. Maynard City was lo- 
cated in the heart of the broad 
western plain of Continent One; 
Dillard lay in fertile farmland 
beyond the great mountain-range 
that divided the continent. 

There were regular commercial 
flights to Dillard each day — but for 
the ten of them, such a flight would 
be the prelude to immediate arrest. 
Lumley screened the airports 
closely. 

1 1 



Instead they would have to make 
the trek overland. Wallace had 
planned their trip for them during 
the night, working out a detailed 
schedule that would bring them to 
Dillard in time to meet the Haxley 
spaceship on the 19th. They would 
take one means of transportation 
and another, assume false identities, 
and with Wallace’s help they would 
lie and bribe their way across the 
continent. 

They could never have managed 
the trip alone. Macintyre glared 
resentfully at Wallace’s broad back, 
and stepped up his pace. 

T HE PLAN called for them to 
proceed on foot over the South 
Bridge and out of the city; at this 
hour, it was not likely that the 
bridge would be guarded. They 
moved along silently through the 
steady rain, over the bridge, into 
the brown farmlands that lay just 
to the southeast of the capital. 

“All right,” Wallace said gruffly. 
“Now the legwork begins.” He 
pointed to the swiftly-flowing, tur- 
bulent waters of the Stinnis River. 
“We’ll advance on foot five miles 
along the river, and pick up the 
riverboat at the town at the bend. 
From there it’s up the river to Col- 
lins’ Ford, and then overland due 
south sixteen miles. Just remember 
that you’re soldier-mercenaries on 
your way east to seek a living in 
Dillard Province, and leave the 
rest to me.” 

The idea of posing as a soldier 
amused Macintyre in a dark way. 
Ten years before he had been one 
of the officers of a pacifist move- 

12 


ment in the mountain town of Hol- 
lister; they had drawn up petitions, 
published muzzy pamphlets, and 
made much noise about disbanding 
the standing army maintained by 
the Maynard administration. After 
a while they had all lost interest in 
the campaign. Macintyre, seeking 
a career in the plastic arts, drifted 
off to Maynard City to study sculp- 
ture in the atelier of a famous Ter- 
ran artist newly emigrated. And 
a decade later the ex-pacifist was 
pretending to be a soldier, to save 
his own skin. 

At the village of Lester Falls, they 
boarded a small early-morning 
river- packet bound eastward on the 
Stinnis. They boarded the vessel 
without incident. 

As he stood staring out over the 
rail, Hallert edged up to him. The 
watery-eyed little man looked 
frightened half to death; he had 
said nothing on the march out of 
Maynard City. 

“How’s your stomach?” Macin- 
tyre asked. 

“I can manage. Do you think 
there’ll be any trouble?” 

“What kind of trouble?” 

“Truthmen trouble,” Hallert 
whispered. “I saw Wallace talking 
to someone in an Army uniform.” 

“So what? Probably an old buddy 
of his.” 

“I don’t like it,” Hallert whis- 
pered. “Suppose he’s selling us out? 
He’s already got a thousand of our 
money ; if he turns us in he gets an- 
other thousand — ” 

Annoyed Macintyre snapped, “I 
don’t give two hoots what you think, 
Hallert! If you think Wallace is go- 
ing to turn us in, jump overboard 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 



and finish the rest of the trip by 
yourself.” 

“You know I can’t do that.” 

“Then keep shut,” Macintyre said 
gloomily. “We’re paying Wallace to 
do a job. We might as well assume 
he’s halfway trustworthy.” 

They stayed that night in a cheap 
dreary hotel in the mining town of 
Collins’ Ford, the ten of them 
crammed into two smoky rooms at 
a dollar apiece. It was a mercen- 
aries’ hostelry; for half the night 
Macintyre lay awake, listening to 
the raucous, uninhibited laughter 
from below. 

Wallace woke him with a shove 
in the ribs, just before dawn. The 
mercenary was bleary-eyed and 
dirty. He smelled of beer. 

“We’re pulling out now,” Wal- 
lace said. “There’s an 0700 train 
going south.” 

“Do we have time to wash?” 

Wallace glared at him half in 
amusement and half in scorn. 
“You’re a soldier, Macintyre. Wash- 
ing’s for civilians. And the more 
filth and stubble you have on that 
pretty face of yours, the less chance 
there is somebody’s going to recog- 
nize you. Come on, now.” 

The monorail station was just 
outside town, perhaps half an hour’s 
walk from the hotel. Feeling drab 
and dirty, Macintyre let himself be 
hustled from the hotel and out onto 
the road with his companions. He 
touched his cheeks: a wiry stubble 
was growing there. This was the 
first day of his adult life on which 
he had gone without shaving and 
it annoyed him. 

The sun was nearly up by the 
THE WAGES OF DEATH 


time they arrived at the depot. 
There was a long line waiting for 
tickets at the tube-mouth. Evidently 
trains did not run frequently out 
here in the flatlands. Macintyre no- 
ticed half a dozen gray uniforms in 
the long line, and went pale. 

He nudged Wallace. “Truth- 
men.” 

“I see them. So what?” 

“Aren’t you afraid that — I mean 
— they might — ” He stopped, 
abashed. 

“They won’t do anything unless 
you give the show away,” Wallace 
grunted. “Keep to yourselves, don’t 
look for trouble, and remember who 
you’re supposed to be in case any- 
body asks you.” 

They joined the line. Fare was 
twenty units apiece; Macintyre 
drew one of his remaining dollars 
from his pocket and idly fondled 
the small yellow coin. He had been 
fairly well-to-do before Lumley; 
now, after contributing two hun- 
dred and fifty dollars towards Wal- 
lace’s hire, he was down to sixty 
dollars and a few units in change. 

Suddenly he saw a familiar face 
in the line ahead of him — Roy 
Charters, a short, bouncy man, a 
confirmed Loyalist and in the old 
days a generous patron of the arts. 
Now Charters was shabby, his hair 
uncombed. It was more than a year 
since Macintyre had seen him. He 
lifted his arm, waved, started to 
call out Charters’ name. 

Instantly Wallace seized his wrist 
and dug his nails in hard. “What 
do you think you’re doing?” he 
whispered furiously. “You want to 
get us all killed?” 

“I saw someone I knew,” Macin- 

13 



tyre said shamefacedly. He glanced 
at his companions. “It was Roy 
Charters,” he explained to Vitello. 
“He’s standing near the front of the 
line.” 

“Who’s this Charters?” Wallace 
asked suspiciously. 

Briefly, Macintyre told him. Wal- 
lace frowned. “Loyalist, eh? Point 
him 'nut to me.” 

Macintyre pointed him out. 

Wallace squinted and nodded. 
“Okay. See that you keep away 
from him. It’s too early in the trip 
to get into trouble.” 

Macintyre shrugged angrily and 
turned away. The line crawled for- 
ward; at last it was his turn. He 
gave his destination, scooped up his 
ticket and his eighty units change, 
and shuffled inside the station, to- 
ward the great single rail along 
which the train was due to come 
rocketing in the next ten minutes. 
He noticed an ominous little group 
of Truthmen standing near the edge 
of the track. Lumley’s special police 
corps, grimly fanatical men. 

The Truthmen boarded the same 
car as they did. Wallace seemed un- 
disturbed ; there were eighty or 
ninety people in the car, and there 
was no reason to suspect they were 
being followed. 

Wallace curled up comfortably in 
the comer of their section of the 
car, took out a pocketknife, and 
began whittling and singing. Mac- 
intyre stared moodily out the win- 
dow. Bryson and Vitello broke into 
a salty argument over the girls of 
Collins’ Ford; Hallert and Maynard 
played cards. It looked convincing 
enough : a group of unshaven, over- 
hung mercenaries en route to a new 

14 


job. Macintyre eyed the reflection of 
the Truthmen in his window. They 
showed no overt interest in the do- 
ings of the noisy group opposite 
them. 

The warning light blinked, the 
departure hum sounded, and the 
train shot away from the Collins’ 
Ford station. Their destination was 
Abramville, sixteen miles southward 
on the north bank of the Hastings 
River. The trip would take just 
eight minutes. 

Despite the presence of the 
Truthmen, it looked to be a placid 
hop. But abruptly the door between 
compartments slid open and a small 
round figure advanced uncertainly 
from the next car. Macintyre stif- 
fened. It was Charters. 

He paused at the front of the car, 
looking around as if in search of 
someone. Then his eyes came to rest 
on Macintyre; he smiled, his face 
lit up, he pointed. He began to say 
something. 

Began. But before he got a word 
out, Wallace was on his feet, letting 
shavings and whittling alike go 
tumbling to the floor. The big man 
crossed the car to where Charters 
stood, threw his arms around the 
other, and with a jovial pseudo- 
drunken outburst drowned out any- 
thing Charters might have been 
about to say. 

Macintyre saw Charters draw 
back in Surprise. He heard Wal- 
lace’s booming voice: “Well, if it 
isn’t old Joe Taylor! Haven’t seen 
you since those days in Palmerston, 
Joe! Come on over and meet the 
boys!” 

Charters went very pale. He drew 
away from Wallace, only to be 

ROBERT SILVERBERG 



playfully tugged across the car. 
Macintyre noticed that the Truth- 
men were watching the scene with 
considerable interest. 

Macintyre heard Charters’ thin 
protest: “I’m afraid I don’t under- 
stand. My name isn’t — ” 

It was drowned out by a drunken 
burst of song. Holding Charters 
firmly with one arm wrapped 
around his shoulders, Wallace 
reeled across the car, staggering past 
the suddenly silent group of Loyal- 
ists. Macintyre heard Charters mur- 
mur as they went past, “If you don’t 
let go of me I’m going to notify 
the—” 

And then they were gone, disap- 
pearing into the washroom at the 
far end of the car. A minute passed, 
two; the sound of drunken singing 
was audible from behind the closed 
door. The Truthmen lost interest; 
self-consciously, the Loyalists re- 
turned to their conversation and 
their cardgames. 

Several minutes went by; the car 
roared into the Abramville sta- 
tion. Still neither Wallace nor 
Charters emerged from, the wash- 
room. Macintyre drummed impa- 
tiently on the windowledge, won- 
dering what was going on in there. 

The main door of the car swung 
open ; the Abramville passengers 
filed out. Macintyre noticed that the 
Truthmen were remaining on the 
train. Shrugging, he said, in the 
rough voice he was trying to culti- 
vate, “Those guys must’ve passed 
out in there. You make sure the 
train don’t leave. I’ll take a peek 
inside.” 

But there was no need for that. 
Wallace appeared suddenly and 

THE WAGES OF DEATH 


gestured for them to get off the 
train. They made it just in time; 
Hallert was the last one off, and 
hardly had he come through the 
hatch when the monorail car went 
swooshing off southward. 

Macintyre turned to Wallace. 
“What was that all about? And 
where’s Charters?” 

“Tell you about it sometime,” 
Wallace murmured. “Let’s go hire 
a riverboat.” 

They found a pier and after some 
haggling Wallace made a deal with 
a sleazy old bargeman to take them 
fourteen miles upstream to the 
township of Miller Bridge. When 
the deal was closed, Wallace led 
them up the embankment to a 
cheap eatery where they break- 
fasted. On the way down toward 
the river again, Macintyre said a 
second time, “Would you mind ex- 
plaining what took place aboard 
the train?” 

“It won’t interest you.” 

“It does. I want to know why you 
dragged Charters off to the wash- 
room. I hadn’t seen that man in a 
year, and now I may never see him 
again. I — 

“Stop asking me questions! And 
don’t worry yourself over Charters.” 
Something in the mercenary’s 
tone enraged Macintyre. It was 
Charters who had contributed most 
of the money Macintyre had needed 
to complete his statuary grouping, 
Sons of Earth , that had had the 
place of honor in Maynard Park un- 
til Lumley’s hammermen smashed 
it to sand. 

“But what did — ” 

Wallace’s jaw-muscles flickered a 
moment. “Look, Macintyre, if I’d 


15 



let that fellow talk to you those 
Truthmen would be dragging us 
away to the Abramville hoosegow 
right now. You know what a Judas 
ram is?” 

“What does that have to do with 
it?” 

“Plenty. Those Truthboys knew 
Charters; I could tell by the way 
they tried to look bored when he 
came in. If I had let him wave 
hello to you, we’d all be finished. 
So I made sure he wouldn’t give 
the show away. It was him or us, 
and I said I’d get you to Dillard. 
I’d handle you the same way if 
necessary.” 

Macintyre felt cold. Obstinately 
he persisted: “What did you do to 
him?” 

“I got him in the washroom and 
asked him where he was getting off. 
He said Donovan. I happened to 
have overheard those Truthmen 
when they bought their tickets, and 
they were going to Donovan too. So 
they would have interrogated your 
pal Charters the second they got 
him alone, and ten minutes after 
that there’d be a three-province 
alarm out for us.” Wallace took a 
deep breath. Tm violating my 
Oath by helping you — so I’m sub- 
ject to the same penalties you are. I 
don’t want to get caught, and I 
knew if I left Charters alone I’d get 
caught. So I opened the washroom 
window and pitched him out. He’s 
lying someplace near the track, nine 
miles back.” 

They reached the waterfront. 
“Come on,” Wallace said, before 
Macintyre could manage to speak. 
“There’s our boat. Let’s get mov- 
ing.” 


A S THEY passed upriver, past 
. the shipping towns and into the 
gathering uplands that led to the 
mountains, Wallace’s calm, self- 
assured words echoed over and 
over: 1 opened the washroom win- 
dow and pitched him out . 

Just like that. It made sense, 
Macintyre thought numbly, on an 
abstract, utterly and remorselessly 
logical plane. The death of one 
man had temporarily insured the 
continued survival of eleven others. 
The survival of that one man would 
have meant death for all twelve. So 
poor Charters had to die. 

Maybe it made sense logically. 
But for half a day Macintyre trem- 
bled at the thought that Wallace 
had been able so coldly to weigh 
one life against eleven, and then 
to kill. It was a pure calculus of 
survival. Macintyre realized for the 
first time how utterly alien Wallace 
was, how far from the set of specifi- 
cations Macintyre had always 
thought applied to the class “ human 
being ” 

Macintyre did not tell the others 
what Wallace had done. He felt 
responsible for having brought the 
mercenary to the group; and in an 
obscure way it was almost as if he 
had killed Charters himself. He 
penned the guilt within himself. 

The 10th passed, and the 11th; 
they travelled by rented car over- 
land toward the town of Hollister, 
the last town of any importance be- 
fore they hit the mountain path. 
They reached Hollister on the 12th, 
half a day ahead of schedule. At 
this rate they would certainly reach 
Dillard — and safety — by the dead- 
line of the 19th.

ROBERT SILVERBERG 



The day was warm and bright; 
Maynard’s temperate zone was in 
its early summer season now. The 
seasons slipped by slowly on May- 
nard. It was a pleasant world. He 
would regret leaving Maynard be- 
hind for the less moderate world of 
Haxley. 

His feelings toward Wallace sub- 
sided slowly. He, of all the group, 
was the only one who seemed ever 
willing to speak to the mercenary. 
The others regarded him as an un- 
avoidable evil, a kind of talking 
pack-animal. Macintyre wondered 
how they would feel toward Wal- 
lace if they were to learn of the in- 
cident aboard the monorail. 

The morning they left Hollister 
and rode mountainward, Macintyre 
found himself at Wallace’s side in 
the truck they had rented. 

He said, “You think we’re going 
to make it?” 

“Probably. It’s easier than I 
thought it would be. Like taking 
money for doing nothing. Twenty- 
five hundred for a trip to Dillard! 
Brother, that’s work I like!” 

“You won’t get much more,” 
Macintyre said. “There aren’t many 
of us left.” 

“That’s true enough. I’m sur- 
prised that ten of you lasted as long 
as you did. You Loyalists are stupid 
bastards. Ten grown men afraid of 
their shadows. Like that meeting in 
the monorail. As soon as Charters 
sang out, ‘Well, if it isn’t Tom Mac- 
intyre,’ that would have been the 
end. But — ” 

“I wish you hadn’t brought that 
up,” Macintyre said, as the truck 
went jouncing up into the heavily- 
wooded foothills. The sun was com- 


ing down stronger. 

“Why? Still can’t understand it, 
can you?” 

“I can — almost see it,” Macintyre 
admitted. “Dammit, Wallace, how 
could you coldbloodedly — ” 

Wallace laughed. “Cold blood? 
Hell, Macintyre, I just like to stay 
alive.” 

“And you’d do anything to stay 
alive?” 

“Wouldn’t you?” 

Stumped, Macintyre looked 
away. After a moment he said, “Let 
me set up a hypothetical situation. 
We cross the mountains and we 
come into a town where the people 
are on the lookout for Loyalists. 
Somehow they find out that — say, 
Hallert — has Loyalist leanings. 
They suspect the rest of us, but 
they’re not sure. Okay. Tell me, 
Wallace: how would you get us 
out of that town safely?” 

The mercenary frowned. “As 
long as we’re playing games, Mac- 
intyre, let me suggest a better one. 
You put yourself in my shoes and 
tell me what I’d be likely to do.” 

“Don’t you see, that’s just what 
I can’t do? Suppose I had to take 
charge of the party — what would I 
do? I don’t know. I’d guess we’d 
all be finished.” 

“Not ' aU ” Wallace said. “Just 
Hallert.” 

“How would you save the rest 

of us?” 

“I’d go to the mayor of that 
town. I’d tell him honestly enough 
that we’d picked up a Loyalist in 
our wanderings. I’d ask him if he’d 
be good enough to take him off our 
hands.” 

“You’d sacrifice Hallert?” ■' 


THE WAGES OF DEATH

Wallace smiled grimly. “When 
your leg’s caught in a trap, Macin- 
tyre, and you hear the hounds com- 
ing after you, the only thing you 
can do is cut your leg off and crawl 
away. There isn’t any time to think 
about whether you’re being fair to 
your leg.” 

Macintyre stared quietly at the 
road a long moment, wondering 
what had shaped this man, what 
had stripped all humanity away 
from him. They had been born on 
the same planet, they both came 
from pure Terran-descended stock 
— but yet, thought Macintyre, com- 
paring the mercenary’s short, strong 
hands with his own tapering fingers, 
there was as much difference be- 
tween the two of them as if they 
hailed from opposite ends of the 
galaxy. 

C ROSSING the mountains took 
three full days, and Macintyre 
was so concerned with the sheer 
physical problem of getting across 
that he let his mind move away 
from Wallace. It was tough, hard 
work crossing those mountains. 
There was no time for theoreticiz- 
ing. 

The weather dipped coldly as 
they ascended; the mountains were 
jagged ruffles in the planet’s skin, 
seven thousand feet high at their 
heights. Macintyre was a warm- 
weather man and he felt the cold. 
Wallace did not seem to mind. They 
rode in open trucks, part of a sup- 
plies convoy crossing to the eastern 
provinces. Wallace had bought 
them into the convoy cheap, on a 
food- work exchange. 


Each night they helped to make 
camp, fumbling with the tents and 
struggling with the chores. Wallace 
obviously was keeping tight rein on 
his patience as the well-meaning ex- 
sculptors and ex-professors tried 
manfully to look like tough mer- 
cenaries. One of the truckdrivers 
wandered over once on the first 
night and stood by, grinning, while 
Hallert and Macintyre puzzled out 
the technique of putting up a fold- 
ing tentpole. The truckman snort- 
ed goodhumoredly. 

“No wonder you’re heading east 
for work!” 

Macintyre looked up. “What’s 
that?” 

“I said it’s small wonder you’re 
out of work. If you two are any 
samples, you’re the damndest bunch 
of amateur mercenaries this side of 
Blue Ocean.” 

Sudden rage thundered through 
Macintyre. Before he had time to 
consider he had brought his fist up 
and connected solidly with the 
man’s chin. The impact bent one of 
his knuckles and sent pain shooting 
up his arm. The trucker took an un- 
certain step backward, wobbled, 
tried to muster his strength for a 
counterattack. Trembling from 
strain, Macintyre readied himself 
for a second punch. 

Wallace leapt between them. 
The mercenary grabbed the burly 
trucker firmly and propelled him 
toward the truck; turning to Mac- 
intyre he said, “What was that all 
about?” 

“He didn’t like the way we were 
putting up the tent. He made some 
remarks.” Macintyre looked at his 
hand. The knuckle of his middle 


18 


ROBERT SILVERBERG 



finger was swelling, and the whole 
hand felt numb. “That’s the first 
time I ever hit a man,” he said. 
“And I didn’t stop to think. I just 
swung.” 

He rubbed his aching hand. “I 
had to do it, though. No hire-soldier 
would take that sort of stuff from 
a trucker.” 

Wallace smiled slowly — and it 
seemed to the startled Macintyre 
that there was real friendliness in 
the mercenary’s eyes for the first 
time. “You know,” Wallace said, 
“I think you’re beginning to un- 
derstand.” 

The rest of the mountain trip 
was without incident, and Macin- 
tyre was greatly relieved when, on 
the afternoon of the 14th, they 
came down out of the Webster 
Hills that marked the extreme east- 
ernmost border of the continental 
divide, and said curt goodbyes to 
the trucking caravan. They had 
been on the road five days now. 
Filthy, ragged, unshaven, they 
looked not even remotely like the 
band of mild Loyalists that had 
set out from Maynard City early 
on the morning of the 9th. 

Now they were in the flatlands of 
Webster Province, the mercantile 
center of the continent; six hun- 
dred miles from Dillard Spaceport. 
Wallace’s itinerary was drawn up 
to skirt the provincial capital, Web- 
ster. It was in Webster that Claude 
Lumley had been bom, it was Web- 
ster that had started him on the 
road to power by electing him as 
their Assembly representative, and 
in Webster anti-Loyalist feeling was 
at an almost hysterical peak. Only 

THE WAGES OF DEATH 


a madman would risk a passage 
through the city. 

Instead they doubled back on 
their tracks, detouring north-north- 
west toward the small river town 
of Lorris, where they could pick up 
a boat travelling downriver toward 
the distant southern coast. It was 
forty miles to Lorris, and they 
reached it near nightfall. Wallace 
knew a good cheap hotel. 

It was a rickety relic of the ear- 
liest settlement days, with flickering 
lumipanels casting an ugly gray 
light and dirty non-opaquing win- 
dows. Macintyre didn’t care. He 
was tired and dirty, and any place 
would do. 

The hotel had a bar, and they sat 
up drinking a while. Wallace was 
as boisterous as ever, but Macintyre, 
sitting by his side, noticed that the 
mercenary had had a total of just 
three beers during the evening. It 
was a point worth noting. Wallace 
always seemed to be drinking, and 
made a great show of being drunk ; 
but in actuality he drank very little, 
and was always fully aware, fully 
on guard. 

Shortly past midnight the group 
headed for their rooms. Macintyre 
was the last to leave the bar. As he 
started out into the dingy corridor, 
he felt a hand gently touch his 
shoulder and pull him back. 

He turned. It was the barkeep- 
proprietor, a faded balding man of 
sixty or so. Whispering, the man 
said, “Come back and have one last 
drink with me, friend.” 

Macintyre frowned. The others 
were gone; throughout the trip he 
had followed a policy of staying 
close to the group. “I’m pretty

tanked,” he said. “Think I’ll get 
some sleep, if y’ don’t mind.” 

“No.” The barkeep tugged in- 
sistently. “Gome back. Let me tell 
you some things you might want to 
know.” 

Macintyre went. As soon as he 
had recrossed the threshold, the old 
man spun and shut the bar door 
firmly; then he looked up at Mac- 
intyre, bloodshot old eyes looking 
at gentle young ones, and said, 
“You’re a Loyalist, aren’t you? You 
and the bunch you came with.” 
Macintyre stiffened. “You’re 
drunk, old man! I’m a free soldier. 
And—” 

“Stop pretending,” said the old 
one softly. “It doesn’t come natural 
to you; you don’t fool me. I won’t 
turn you in. I want to warn you.” 
“Warn me of what?” 

“That man Wallace. Get quit of 
him. He’s deadly.” 

Macintyre drew the old man 
down next to him at one of the 
tables and said, “What do you 
know about Wallace?” 

“He came through Lorris about 
two months ago with a party of 
five. Loyalists. They were paying 
him to get them to the coast — I 
guess they figured on taking a boat 
over to Ludlow Island and hide out. 
Only when they got to Dillard he 
collected his fee from them and 
sold ’em all to the Truthmen.” 
Macintyre felt the blood drain 
from his face. “Where’d you hear 
that?” 

“Never you mind. But when I 
saw that same ugly fellow come 
through here again, and ten fellows 
with him, I knew he was pulling 
the same thing all over again. 

20 


Watch for yourselves, friend. You’re 
in rough hands.” 

“How am I supposed to believe 
this?” 

The barkeep smiled indifferently. 
“I don’t give a damn if you believe 
me. I’m trying to help you.” His 
face darkened. “I know what you 
boys are going through. I’d be with 
you myself, except — well, I’m not 
young, and the hotel doesn’t bring 
in much. When they came around 
asking me to sign the Oath I signed. 
But I keep a little globe of Earth 
upstairs.” He rose. “It’s getting late. 
You never know who’s listening.” 
Macintyre nodded. “Thanks,” he 
said shakily. 

He had no chance to discuss this 
new information with the others 
until the morning of the 17 th, when 
they were a hundred and fifty miles 
from Dillard. They stopped in a 
small town called Fleury. Wallace 
left them while he went into town 
to make arrangements for covering 
the remaining distance. 

Macintyre told the group what 
the innkeeper had said, adding, “I 
guess it’s my fault for having got 
us into this.” 

Hallert looked up owlishly. “How 
sure are you that the old man was 
telling the truth?” 

“You can’t be sure of anything. 
But I’m willing to believe that Wal- 
lace came this way once before and 
sold his clients to the Truthmen at 
the end of the trip. Let’s assume 
that it’s so. What do we do?” 

“We could go up to him and ask 
him just what his intentions are 
when we reach Dillard,” Bryson 
said. 


ROBERT SILVERBERG 



The suggestion was so naive that 
Macintyre laughed. “And I guess 
we could get him to promise he 
won’t hand us in, I suppose. Sorry, 
Mark. It won’t go.” 

“Then what do we do?” Hallert 
asked desperately. “Just ride along 
and hand over our money and let 
him sell us to the Truthmen?” 

“We go to Dillard by ourselves, 
now,” suggested Vitello. “We 
haven’t had any trouble so far, and 
we’re practically there. If we hurry, 
before Wallace comes back from 
town — ” 

“Don’t be a fool,” Hallert 
snapped pettishly. “If he finds us 
gone he’ll wire ahead to Dillard 
and notify the authorities. No, that 
won’t work either. But suppose 
we — ” 

Macintyre listened impatiently. 
All they did was talk, he thought, 
and kick feeble suggestions around, 
none of them daring to approach 
the concrete. There was only one 
solution. He knew what it was. 

Fifteen minutes more of discus- 
sion followed. It developed that the 
prevailing sentiment of the group 
was, Wait and See. Wallace’s re- 
turn ended the discussion. He had 
engaged three trucks to see them 
down the road toward Dillard, and 
they left. 

Macintyre was seated near Wal- 
lace. He stared covertly at the mer- 
cenary as they pulled out of Fleury ; 
the man seemed to take on more 
awesomely monstrous characteristics 
each day, as they saw more and 
more of him in action. Yet he had 
the knack of seeming good com- 
pany, cheerful, quick-witted, bawdy 
of tongue, and Macintyre found 

THE WAGES OF DEATH 


himself forgetting that this was the 
man who had killed Charters and 
had sold five earlier Loyalists to the 
Truthmen. Who perhaps was going 
to do the same to them. 

Macintyre stared at the yellow 
and purple splotches of shrubbery 
flanking the road. “You’re almost 
safe,” Wallace said. “Weren’t you 
silly to hire me? You can see how 
easy it was.” 

“Easy for you, maybe. We’d never 
have made it.” 

Wallace nodded. “I guess you’re 
right. You wouldn’t have gotten 
through. You wouldn’t have the 

guts.” 

Macintyre tensed, and forced 
himself to subside. Wallace grinned. 
“Easy, there. Don’t go picking 
fights with me.” 

“Then don’t make yourself any 
more offensive than you have to 
be,” Macintyre snapped. 

“There we go, there we go!” 
Wallace crowed. “Spoken like a 
man — for the first time in your 
spineless life! This trip has almost 
been the making of you, Macin- 
tyre.” 

Macintyre turned. “You enjoy 
taunting us, don’t you? Because 
we’re not coldblooded. You love to 
tell us that we think too much, that 
we stall instead of acting. I guess it 
never occurs to you that there are 
such things as moral codes, and 
ethical choices for a man to make. 
Eh?” 

Wallace looked curiously serious. 
“What gives you that idea?” 

“The way you act. The way you 
think. The way you pushed that 
harmless man off the train.” The 
way you sold those five to the 


21 



T ruthmen , he added, silently. 
“Ruthlessness is a way of life with 
you, isn’t it?” 

“It’s a way of staying alive,” 
Wallace admitted. “It’s a hard 
world. It’s a hard universe, brother. 
And the universe doesn’t give a 
damn about you or me or Claude 
Lumley. You have to take care of 
yourself.” 

“Which means killing anyone 
who gets in your way,” Macintyre 
said. 

“It may look that way to you, 
but that’s because you don’t under- 
stand. Look, Macintyre : when I 
was very young I sat down and 
worked out my idea of the way the 
world worked. I figured out what I 
wanted out of life. I figured out 
what I had to do to get it. And I’ve 
been doing it ever since. I have my 
own code. I know my limits and I 
stick to them. And I guess to you 
I look like an ape, eh?” 

Macintyre was silent. He stared 
at the bouncing road and tried to 
piece his thoughts together. “I — 
had a philosophy too,” he said after 
a while. “I thought it worked. It 
didn’t include killing people or be- 
traying ideals. And — and — ” 

“And it ended up bringing you 
here, a miserable fugitive who has 
to hire a nursemaid to get you off 
the planet.” With elaborate delib- 
erateness Wallace spat; the stream 
landed an inch from Macintyre’s 
boots. “Go ahead,” Wallace urged. 
“Stand up and pitch me off the 
truck. You’re big — just as big as 
I am. But you won’t fight.” 

“No,” Macintyre said, moving his 
feet. “I won’t. I’m a human being.” 
Wallace merely laughed. 


T HE NEXT DAY was the 18th, 
and they approached the out- 
skirts of Dillard now. Macintyre’s 
mind dwelled only on the day to 
come. Tomorrow. They would pay 
Wallace the $1500 they owed him, 
and they would leave for Haxley 
that night. Or would they? Would 
Wallace pocket his cash and phone 
the Truthmen? 

Tomorrow was hazed round with 
doubts. But slowly, out of the haze, 
the answer presented itself, and 
Macintyre found himself unable to 
deny its validity. 

The evidence showed that Wal- 
lace would betray them. Every sign 
of his character showed that, and 
the words of the innkeeper in Lor- 
ris. There was always the chance 
that he had no such intention, of 
course ; but the cloud of doubt 
could not be dispelled. Macintyre 
knew he could take no chance. 

No. Wallace was confident; too 
confident. 

He looked at the whiteness of his 
hands. Yellowish, now, from callus. 
He wondered if he had the strength 
to kill. 

They stopped that night at 
Brownston, twenty miles from the 
spaceport. They would be in plenty 
of time for their rendezvous with 
Ritterheim the next day, if — 

The Loyalists buzzed with nerv- 
ous tension. Like so many little 
bees , Macintyre thought. 

He stood before a mirror, staring 
at the thin high-bridged nose, the 
soft eyes. Was this a killer’s face? 
He took a deep breath. 

Wallace had been necessary to 
the success of their journey. But 
the journey was over. Wallace had 


22 


ROBERT SILVERBERG 



to be discarded, before he wrecked 
the entire crossing at the final mo- 
ment. 

Macintyre’s hand gripped the 
knife. It felt cold and strange. He 
tiptoed from his room, down the 
hall, toward the room where Wal- 
lace and Bryson were booked. 

He pushed open the door. They 
were asleep: the small man on a 
cot, Wallace on the bed. Macintyre 
felt almost calm. He crossed the 
room and stood over the slumber- 
ing Wallace. 

So he’s human after all, Macin- 
tyre thought. He doesn’t have an 
automatic danger-alarm built into 
his skull to wake him up. 

Macintyre unsheathed the knife 
and gently touched Wallace’s shoul- 
der. The mercenary grunted sleep- 
ily, opened one eye, and said, 
“What do you want, Macintyre?' 5 

“I wanted to ask you about those 
five Loyalists you sold to the Truth- 
men last month.” 

“Huh? You having a nightmare, 
Macintyre?” 

“Maybe I am. But tell me the 
truth or I’ll cut you open, Wallace. 
I’m not kidding.” 

Wallace grunted. “Go back to 
sleep, will you?” 

“Answer me!” 

“What if I told you I did sell 
them? What if I told you I was 
going to do the same to you?” Wal- 
lace sat up suddenly in the bed. “If 
I told you that, Mac, what could 
you do about it?” 

“This,” Macintyre said, and 
brought the knife upward from his 
hip. Wallace saw it at the last mo- 
ment; his reflexes asserted them- 
selves, and he tried to block the 

THE WAGES OF DEATH 


blow, to seize Macintyre’s arm. But 
the effort failed. The knife plunged; 
Wallace sank back. In an indis- 
tinct voice he muttered, “I guess I 
underestimated you, Mac.” 

And then the room was quiet. 

Macintyre stood alone, holding 
the bloody knife. He heard the door 
open ; he turned, saw them filing in, 
Hallert and Vitello and the rest. 
He forced himself to grin. 

“He meant to turn us in,” Mac- 
intyre said. 

He saw them looking blankly at 
him, then to the knife, then to the 
body on the bed. Nobody was speak- 
ing. 

“What’s the matter?” he de- 
manded. “He would have turned 
us in. We’re safe, now. We can go 
to Dillard in the morning.” 

But he saw that they did not un- 
derstand. There was blank horror 
in their eyes, and he realized that 
he had never belonged with them 
at all. He was not their kind. He 
had pretended to be their kind, had 
fooled himself into thinking it, but 
he was not. 

He looked toward the bed; his 
eyes, grown accustomed to the 
dark, sought the dead man’s face. 
Wallace was smiling. Wallace had 
understood. The mercenary had 
had a code, and he had lived by it 
and died by it. Wallace had been 
a killer and a cheat and a traitor, 
but he had been a superb killer, a 
splendid cheat. They had hired him 
to do a job, and he had done it 
with magnificent competence. 

You have to respect him for it, 
Macintyre thought leadenly. He let 
the knife drop. 

Wallace had dealt out death; the 


23 



wages of death is death. It was sim- 
ple, neat, valid. But now something 
new was arising. 

Macintyre looked at the nine 
awed statues. “There’s a spaceship 
leaving for Haxley tomorrow,” he 
said quietly. “It’s blasting out of 
Dillard Spaceport. I want you all 
to make sure you’re on it. You 
need to be. This isn’t any world for 
you.” 

“And what are you going to do?” 
Maynard asked, in a hoarse, fright- 
ened voice. 

“I’m going to stay here on your 
grandad’s world,” Macintyre said. 
“I made this trip for nothing. I’m 
not really a Loyalist, you know. I 
decided that last night. You people 
are, because you don’t have the 
courage to step forward and change 
things. You don’t like Lumley, so 
you hide in cellars and wait for 
him to come kill you. 

“I guess I’m not like that. I just 
found that out, tonight. What I 
want to stay here and do is to keep 
an eye on Lumley, to work for the 
sort of planet I want.” 

Macintyre took a deep breath. 
He expected a reaction, the revolt 


of strained nerves, but he was calm. 
“The way to fight Lumley is to 
fight him out in the open. So I’ll 
take the Oath of Allegiance first, 
and be a legal citizen again. And 
then I can try to do something.” 

He walked to the door. It was 
almost morning, and the sun was 
coming over the Eastern Ocean to- 
ward them, brightening the sky. 
“You know what I’m going to do 
now?” he asked. “I’m going to 
walk into town and wait for the 
post office to open. And then I’m 
going to take the Oath. And none 
of you will ever understand why, 
will you?” 

He glanced at the man on the 
bed. “So long, Wallace. It’s too bad 
we couldn’t have known each other 
under different circumstances!” 

He opened the door and looked 
back at Maynard and Hallert and 
the others — white, dumfounded 
men. He smiled at them, but they 
did not smile back. He turned, 
closing the door carefully behind 
him, and started down the road, on 
the long walk toward the post of- 
fice in Dillard. END

The Zades had their sample Earthling. What would eventually 
happen to the whole depended on what happened to v the 
specimen. It was as simple as that! 


AS OFFICIAL reporter on the project I was in Srtes ? 
-£jL office when they brought the alien in. He was as tall 
as an average Zade, of pretty much the same color, and 
would have been able to pass as one of us except that he 
had no vestigial wings. It gave his shoulders an odd, flat, 
appearance, and somehow added to the abrupt awk- 
wardness of every movement of his body. He might have 
had wires rather than muscles beneath his soft dark skin. 


SPECIMEN 


There were other, mi- 
nor differences, of course. 
Hair grew not only on 
his head, but also on his 
body. Coarse, black hair. 
It could be seen on his 


hands and the exposed 
portions of his arms, and 
on his chest where his 


blouse was open at the neck. His eyes were brown and 
set wide apart, with long hairs on the lid edges. His nose 
had no hard upper ridge. The bone was covered only by 
the same flesh as the rest of his face. 


He was accompanied by a Commander Leik, captain 
of the space ship that had brought him from Earth. 
When they entered Srtes rose and set the scroll he had 
been studying to one side. “I welcome you back,” he 


BY CHARLES V. DE VET 



said to Leik, touching his cheek 
with the greeting finger of his left 
hand. 

Leik respectfully returned the 
gesture. “I am once more content,” 
he replied. 

“Has he been instructed in our 
language?” Srtes asked, after the 
brief formalities were over. He in- 
dicated the Earth native. 

“He has become quite adept dur- 
ing the eight great tides since we 
left his world,” the Commander an- 
swered. 

“It is well.” Srtes turned and 
eyed the Earth man searchingly. 

The alien returned the gaze, not 
defiantly, yet not at all subservient- 
ly. I could tell that he was ill at 
ease. A fine sprinkling of perspira- 
tion dotted his forehead, and he 
breathed slowly and deeply, as 
though carefully timing each in- 
halation and exhalation. 

“Do you have a name?” Srtes 
asked him. 

He made a nodding motion with 
his head. “John Wilson,” he said. 
The words were clear enough, but 
spoken with a slurred, soft-palate, 
sound. 

“You have two names?” The 
hairlines above Srtes 5 eyes raised 
slightly. 

“It is the custom on their world,” 
Leik supplied. “The surname has a 
clan connotation.” 

“You understand your purpose 
here?” Srtes asked the outworlder. 

“Yes.” He added nothing to the 
reply. 

“You are aware that there are no 
restrictions on the study we may 
make of you?” 

“Yes.” 


“Even that we may dissect you. 
or kill you, if we so desire?” 

The alien’s complexion changed 
subtly, becoming slightly lighter, 
and his lips pressed firmly together. 
He made the bobbing motion with 
his head again. 

“His nodding signifies an affirma- 
tive reply,” Leik interjected. “He 
volunteered to come with us, so he 
is quite familiar with the condi- 
tions.” 

“Volunteered?” 

“It is strange,” Leik agreed. 
“Yet when I offered to leave one of 
our men in return for a specimen 
of their race — so that mutual study 
might be made — I was firmly re- 
fused. It seems their culture has 
some absurd belief in inherent 
rights of its individual members. I 
was saved the inconvenience of ab- 
ducting the necessary specimen 
when this one volunteered.” 

Srtes had difficulty grasping the 
concept. His forehead creased in 
concentration for a moment before 
he said, “Perhaps it would be better 
if I read the report first. In the 
meantime, please escort him to our 
physiologists on the ground floor. 
They can begin their stu^y immedi- 
ately.” 

F OR seventeen days they ex- 
amined the alien. As expected, 
they learned quickly that his body 
was intrinsically weak. His vital or- 
gans had no protective walls of 
cartilage, and he was extremely 
vulnerable to the thrust of any 
sharp or pointed weapon. 

Our first opinion was that he 
would prove an innocuous foe. 

CHARLES V. DE VET 


34 



However, as the tests continued, 
we began to have some doubts. 
Physically he was quite powerful. 
His reflexes were sharp, and he 
showed an aptness at learning that 
surprised us. And his intelligence 
was above average. 

The twentieth day I was ordered 
to report to Srtes’ office. I found 
the other seven members of the 
council already conferring with 
Srtes when I entered. 

“We have been unable to arrive 
at any definite conclusion thus far,” 
Srtes was saying. “Therefore it be- 
comes necessary to try him in the 
Big Run.” He paused and frowned 
in annoyance as I made some slight 
disturbance. Hurriedly I took my 
place. I moved among these men 
only by sufferance. 

“One of the crewmen on the 
space ship that brought him here,” 
Srtes resumed, “a Zade named 
Gtvar, clashed with the alien sev- 
eral times during the voyage. He 
was restrained from violence by the 
captain. This Ctvar should prove 
an apt instrument for driving our 
hostage to the proper desperation 
for the Big Run.” 

Srtes switched on the large visi- 
screen that blanketed the front wall 
of his office. “The alien has been 
wandering through the streets for 
the past several hours,” he said. “If 
we are fortunate, Gtvar should put 
in his appearance soon.” 

The visi-screen flickered once, 
cleared, and exposed an outside 
street. At the far end the alien — 
John Wilson, as he caMed himself — 
walked slowly, with his head down, 
and his hands in the pockets of the 

SPECIMEN 


outlandish jacket he had brought 
with him. He proceeded aimlessly, 
with a peculiar, jerky, movement 
of his limbs. Perhaps he was lone- 
some for his home world, and un- 
certain of what awaited him . 

A party of Zade men left a 
drinking place just ahead of him. 
They were quarreling — without 
any particular rancor — and one of 
them was loudly keening a verse of 
hunting song. At their forefront 
strode a burly Zade with a bush of 
red-orange hair. 

“The big one is the crewman I 
mentioned,” Srtes pointed out. 

The burly Zade spied the alien 
and a pleased burst of laughter 
rumbled up from his chest. “Our 
unwinged friend from Earth!” he 
shouted. It was a deadly insult. 

As the alien stopped uncertainly, 
Gtvar and his friends crowded 


around him. “Are all Earthlings 
wingless freaks?” one of them asked 
in a loud voice. The others laughed. 

I expected the alien to show some 
fight, but he only stood silently. 

The party of Zades showed their 
contempt by increasing the tempo 
of their insults. Still the Earthling 


did nothing. 

Finally Gtvar became disgusted 
with the other’s spinelessness and 
spat in his face, at the same time 


reaching out to grab him. 

I heard several gasps from those 
around me as the alien moved. His 


actions the next moment were al- 


most too swift for us to follow. He 


spread his legs slightly, as Ctvar 
reached for him, and swung his 


right fist. An instant later Gtvar 
lay on the ground. One leg made a 
continuous kicking motion, but it 


35 



was only a reflex action. Ctvar had 
been knocked unconscious! 

The shouting of the other Zades 
quieted to an ugly murmur, and 
they surged forward. The Earthling 
set his back against the building be- 
hind him and struck out at his at- 
tackers, but they overwhelmed him 
by sheer numbers and dragged him 
to the ground. 

They beat him and stamped sev- 
eral times on his body before a 
squad of sentinels appeared and 
broke them up. 

“A fine start,” Srtes said. 

“Unless he is already dead.” 

“I don’t believe he is,” Srtes an- 
swered. “But if he is no more 
hardy than that, there will be no 
necessity for us to learn more.” 

The Earthling proved to be 
much hardier. And more stubborn. 

The sentinels, of course, gave 
him no further help. They would 
not have stopped the fight, except 
that they had orders from Srtes to 
save our visitor from any disabling 
injury, if at all possible. 

The Earthling lay on the ground 
for only a short while before he 
pulled himself to a sitting position. 
His face was bruised, blood ran 
from his nose, and one eye was 
swollen and closed. With the other 
he followed the progress of Ctvar 
and his party as they went on to the 
next drinking place. 

When he climbed to his feet his 
left leg buckled but he limped about 
on it for a few minutes until he 
could walk. He strode purposefully 
toward the drinking place Ctvar’s 
party had entered, and pushed his 
way inside. 

36 


Someone behind me muttered 
angrily. There was no pick-up in 
the drinking place and we could 
only watch the exterior of the build- 
ing. 

We did not have long to wait. 
The sound of commotion inside 
reached us soon after the alien en- 
tered. A short time later he tum- 
bled out through the doorway. His 
body was limp as it landed in the 
dirt street. He lay motionless. A few 
minutes later we caught another 
view of Ctvar. He and two of his 
friends were carried from the drink- 
ing place. 

The alien did not recover so 
quickly this time. His first move- 
ment was a slow rocking of his 
head. At each motion a low groan 
came from his lips. He made several 
attempts to regain his feet, but his 
legs would not hold him. At last he 
began crawling toward his room a 
few blocks away. He left a small 
trail of blood behind him. 

It took him almost an hour of 
crawling, between rests, to reach 
his room. 

I left Srtes’ office with the coun- 
cil members. There would be little 
to observe for some days, and that 
little I could watch on the screen 
in my own cubicle. 


A LL the next day the alien lay 
. on his sleeping rug. He rose 
only in response to his nature calls, 
and once to fix himself a bowl of 
porridge. However, the following 
afternoon, though he was obviously 
still not at all physically fit, he 
dressed and left $s room. 

It took me a few minutes after 


CHARLES V. DE VET 



he reached the street to realize that 
he was heading for the Building 
Administrates. Undoubtedly to 
complain to Srtes of the treatment 
he had received at the hands of 
Ctvar and his party. And just when 
I was beginning to have some small 
amount of respect for the out- 
worlder. 

I switched hurriedly to Srtes and 
informed him of the imminent visit. 
At the same time I requested per- 
mission to cover the interview. The 
request was granted. 

Srtes’ visitor surprised us by mak- 
ing no complaint against Ctvar, 
and requesting no protection. 

He declined the hassocks Srtes 
offered him, and stood with his 
hands clasped behind his back. “I’ve 
heard nothing from you for some 
time now,” he said. “Does that 
mean your examiners are finished 
with me?” 

“That is correct,” Srtes answered 
courteously. 

“What comes next?” he asked. 

“Next?” Srtes repeated. “Why, 
that is your own decision. My in- 
terest in you ceased the day our 
study was complete. You are free 
now to do as you wish.” 

The alien thought that over for 
a time. “You do not intend to re- 
turn me to Earth?” he asked. 

“Is there any reason why you 
should expect us to?” Srtes replied. 

“To me it seems there is,” he 
said. “I fulfilled my part of the con- 
tract. Shouldn’t I expect you, as a 
fair return, to see that I got back 
to Earth?” 

Srtes’ expression betrayed a mild 
irritation. “We had no contract,” 


he said. “You were given to us to 
do with as we wished. Now that 
our study is completed, we owe you 
nothing.” 

“I expected as much,” the alien 
said, almost without interest. “Will 
you tell me then, what I can do to 
help myself? I presume you do not 
intend to furnish me with food and 
shelter indefinitely.” 

“You will be permitted to keep 
your room until you find new quar- 
ters. The rest is your own responsi- 
bility.” 

He considered that for a long 
moment. “Do you have any sugges- 
tions as to how I might go about 
earning my living?” he asked. 

“If you have any serviceable skill, 
you will probably be able to find 
employment for it. If not — ” Srtes 
shrugged. 

“How would I know what skills 
would be useful here? I know prac- 
tically nothing about you.” 

“I’m afraid that’s your own prob- 
lem,” Srtes said. “If you are un- 
able to adapt, you will not survive. 
It is the natural law.” 

The alien’s eyes narrowed. He 
seemed to be holding in check a 
cold anger. “Tell me,” he said. “Do 
you consider yourselves just?” 

Srtes’ hair bristled until his head 
appeared twice its normal size. He 
half rose from his hassock, then 
slowly resumed his seat. I admired 
his self-restraint. 

“We consider ourselves extreme- 
ly fair,” he said carefully. “Only 
the strong have the right to survive, 
and the fact that they do survive 
proves their strength. What you are 
determines your end. We are de- 
manding nothing more from you 

37

than we expect from our own citi- 
zens. Weaklings and inefficients are 
perishing every day on the ragged 
confines of our civilization. In sim- 
ple justice I can offer you nothing 
more.” 

The Earthling’s shoulders had 
gradually drooped as Srtes spoke. 
“Yours is a harsh philosophy,” he 
mumbled at the end. 

“It is our means of being certain 
that we maintain our race’s fitness,” 
Srtes explained patiently. “On this 
world only the strong and their 
progeny survive. As long as that 
natural struggle continues the 
strength of each generation will be- 
come greater.” 

The alien seemed to recognize 
Srtes’ sincerity. He rose tiredly. 
“Thanks, for the explanation at 
least,” he said, as he left the office. 

T HE NEXT step would be mine. 

During the rest of the after- 
noon, as I watched on the visi- 
screen, the Earthling kept to his 
room. Most of the day he lay on 
his sleeping rug, with his eyes wide 
open, staring at the ceiling. The 
rest of the time he paced aimlessly. 
The next morning he ate the last 
of his porridge, and as the day pro- 
gressed I recognized that much of 
his unrest must be prompted by 
hunger. Yet his battered body 
needed the rest he was giving it. 

He napped shortly after dusk, 
but only for a short time. When he 
awoke he put on his jacket and 
went outside. On the screen I fol- 
lowed his forlorn wanderings about 
the city. 

After several hours he stopped 
38 


and leaned against a wooden build- 
ing. The night breeze had risen to 
its near-gale intensity by this time, 
and he pulled his jacket closer 
about him. It was only a few de- 
grees below freezing, and he should 
have been warm enough, but I 
understood his race was unable to 
withstand any great degree of cold. 
And he was sore and hungry. 

I received my call from Srtes 
then. He and the council had de- 
cided that the alien had reached 
the proper depth of misery and 
hopelessness. I was to contact him 
— and set him for the Big Run. 

I found him still leaning against 
the same wooden building. He 
looked up at me from under his 
heavy brows as I neared him. I kept 
a safe distance between us. I re- 
membered Ctvar. “Will you allow 
me to buy you something to eat?” I 
asked, deciding to use a direct ap- 
proach. 

I liked the way he did not ask 
any questions. He merely regarded 
me for a moment longer, then made 
his nodding motion. 

All through the meal in the pub- 
lic eating place he remained silent. 
He ate hungrily but without haste 
and only when he’d finished did he 
speak again. “Why?” he asked. 

“I do not understand what you 
mean,” I evaded. 

“I haven’t learned much about 
you Zades since I’ve been here,” 
he said, “but I have learned that 
you do nothing out of kindness. 
What do you want from me?” 

I forced myself to smile. “You 
are right, of course,” I said. “I do 
want something from you. Informa- 

CHARLES V. DE VET 



tion about your world. In return 
for your cooperation I will see that 
you continue to be well fed.” 

“I thought Srtes was through 
with me,” he said. 

“My interest is strictly personal,” 
I answered. “I am what you would 
call a reporter. We give out our 
news on disseminators similar to 
your television.” 

I had caught his interest. I sup- 
pose he was eager to learn anything 
that he might use to make his way. 
“I’ve seen no signs of television,” 
he said. 

“This is one of our smaller cities,” 
I improvised quickly. “There are 
only a few receiving sets here. Most 
of them are in the main halls of the 
various clans.” 

The explanation satisfied him. 
“Just what do you want to know?” 
he asked. 

“Anything about your Earth that 
you think might be of interest to 
my listeners.” 

“Couldn’t you get that from Srtes 
and his^taff?” 

“Their supply of information is 
limited. You should be able to give 
me much more.” 

He was actually eager to talk. It 
probably relieved his homesickness. 
We returned to his room, and our 
conversation took up most of the 
rest of the night. Toward morning 
he began questioning me. 

“I’ve given you all the informa- 
tion you asked for,” he said. “Now 
I’d like some in return. Can you 
suggest any way I can make a liv- 
ing on this world of yours?” 

I thought for a moment. “You 
might be able to introduce some 
product of your civilization’s tech- 

SPECIMEN 


nology that would be useful here. 
Not knowing your world, I couldn’t 
suggest just what.” 

“I should be able to come up 
with something,” he said thought- 
fully. “Would I be allowed to man- 
ufacture and sell it if I did?” 

“If you can demonstrate that you 
can do it better than anyone else, 
you will be given an exclusive right 
to control both its construction and 
distribution.” 

“Does that apply to every func- 
tion of your society?” he asked. 

“This world belongs to those who 
can prove their strength,” I an- 
swered. 

“That’s a bit different than on 
Earth,” he said. “We have always 
held that competition makes for the 
best results.” 

I had become quite interested in 
the discussion, and found myself 
giving a rather lengthy explanation 
of that part of our society’s func- 
tioning. “Competition is very real 
here, even though it is less tangible 
than yours. The fact that a pro- 
ducer of a product or service may 
be displaced by anyone demonstrat- 
ing a better or more efficient prod- 
uct or method, acts as a spur to 
best efforts. The price is set by the 
state, with the prices of competing 
bidders in mind. Under our system 
time and energy is not wasted mak- 
ing inferior goods, or those already 
in adequate supply. The purchasers, 
also, are never exposed to an in- 
ferior article.” 

I was becoming quite drowsy by 
this time and left after I’d an- 
swered a few more of his questions. 
I felt affection toward the Earth- 
ling. He was direct and honest. Be- 

39 



neath his placid manner he had a 
pride as fierce as any Zade. Tomor- 
row would be the crucial day for 
him. 


L ATE the next afternoon I 
i bought a packet of food and 
brought it to the ou two rider’s room. 
“Did you have trouble with a Zade 
named Ctvar?” I asked him, im- 
mediately on entering. 

“Yes, I did,” he answered. 
“Why?” 

“His clansmen have been pour- 
ing into the city all day. I just 
learned that they are looking for 

His eyes widened slightly. “Isn’t 
Ctvar able to handle his own trou- 
ble?” 

“Ctvar is dead.” 

He seemed unable at first to find 
the words to speak. At last he said, 
“It happened in a fight that he 
started. Why should they seek re- 
venge?” 

“They would be poor clan broth- 
ers if they did not avenge him,” 
I answered. 

“Won’t your sentinels do any- 
thing to stop them?” he asked. 

“They won’t help you,” I an- 
swered. “You make no contribution 
to the state that would entitle you 
to their protection.” 

“Don’t you have laws against this 
sort of thing?” 

“An undetermined number of 
persons wish you dead. You, and 
perhaps I, want you to live. The 
majority is against us.” 

“But I’m at least entitled to a 
trial.” 

I puzzled over his meaning of 


the word, but could find no sure an- 
swer. “I don’t know what the pur- 
pose of a trial would be,” I said. 
“But it could change nothing. You 
have the ill will of many citizens.” 
He stared at the floor without 
any further questions. 

Against the strong logic of my 
reasoning I felt a strong empathy 
toward him. He had conducted 
himself well on this world that must 
seem very strange to him. I offered 
what consolation I could. “There 
is this possibility,” I said. “A ma- 
jority is not always reckoned by 
numbers. If you can collect supe- 
rior strength to your side — either by 
getting others to help you, or by 
your own ingenuity — and whip 
Ctyar’s clan, the law will do noth- 
ing to punish you. You may even 
kill them with impunity, except for 
the revenge of the other clansmen.” 
“That’s a small hope.” 

“It is,” I agreed, belatedly recall- 
ing to mind my mission. I was prob- 
ably this minute under disapprov- 
ing observation. “You can’t hope to 
fight them all,” I continued. “That 
is why I would earnestly suggest 
that you run.” 

“To where would I run?” 

“I gave that a good deal of 
thought on my way here,” I said. 
“There’s a space ship — on a mead- 
ow outside the walls, on the far side 
of the city — that you might be able 
to reach. You could take it and 
flee to your ,own world, probably 
the only place where you’d be safe.” 
“I wouldn’t know how to oper- 
ate it.” 

“The ship is very nearly auto- 
matic. Look,” I said. I took a sheet 
of velum, and a stylus, and drew 

CHARLES V. DE VET 


40 



three circles with smaller circles be- 
neath them. “These represent the 
dials on the ship’s control panel. 
The bubbles in the first dial must 
be set in this order — you’d better 
memorize them — blue-blue-yellow- 
blue-yellow. That’s the range for 
your Earth. You’ll have to shrink 
the last yellow bubble to about 
three-quarter size. That will give 
you a safety leeway. The ship will 
take itself in on motors from there. 

“This second dial starts the ship. 
You merely squeeze the knob be- 
neath it. The third dial is for stop- 
ping. As you are about to land, the 
tighter you grip the knob, the slow- 
er the ship will settle. You shouldn’t 
have any trouble manipulating it.” 

His spirits seemed to revive some- 
what. “It’s worth a try,” he said. “I 
have nothing to lose.” 

“It’s only a few hours to night- 
fall,” I told him. “That will be the 
best time to try getting through the 
city. I’d suggest you eat a good 
meal, and fix yourself a lunch to 
take along. Then nap if you can.” 

I was back in Srtes’ office, watch- 
ing the big screen, with the eight 
council members, when the alien 
started out. That was shortly after 
dusk. It is never completely dark 
on Zade. 

He was shrewd enough to leave 
his room the back way, I observed. 
There was no rear door, but he 
let himself down from the balcony, 
dropping the last few feet to the 
ground. 

“He is wearing a sword, I see,” 
a white haired councilor remarked. 

“Yes,” Srtes answered. “He was 
given it when they were testing his 


weapons adaptability. But the fool 
filed it down until it is hardly thick- 
er than a reed. It will be a poor 
weapon.” 

The alien hugged the wall of the 
house, and after glancing into the 
opening between it and the next, 
scurried quickly across. Two build- 
ings farther on the rear court end- 
ed, and he had to go around to the 
front. When he reached the yellow 
pedestrian walk he did not turn, 
as we might have expected, but 
went on across a second courtyard. 

“He realizes that the normally 
travelled yellow walks would not be 
very safe,” Srtes said. “I wonder 
how long it will take him to solve 
the enigma of the others.” 

At the next white street he turned 
to his right. When he reached the 
end and learned that he had gone 
up a blind alley he retraced his 
steps and went across to a perpen- 
dicular blue street. He seemed a 
bit nervous now. 

A third of the way down the blue 
walk he ran into the invisible elec- 
tric shock wall, and staggered back- 
ward. The lunch packet that he 
carried fell from his hand, and he 
was obviously too stunned to re- 
member to pick it up as he started 
back. 

He had retreated only a short 
way before he paused and stood 
considering his situation. After a 
minute he returned and examined 
the buildings at each side of the 
electrified area. He must have 
found that the conduction outlets 
did not extend to the ground, for 
soon he began crawling forward on 
his hands and knees. 

“A point for the alien,” I heard 


SPECIMEN 


41 



Srtes murmur. I detected a hint of 
admiration in his voice. 

The alien kept his caution, for 
when the ground cayed beneath his 
hand, at the end of the third street, 
he did not fall into the trap. He 
simply rolled back and lay quietly 
for a moment. Another decision. 

He was equal to it. Rising to his 
feet, he took a short run and leaped 
for the balcony on the nearest 
building. From there it was an easy 
matter to reach the roof. Observing 
carefully below before each ven- 
ture, he leaped from roof to roof 
until he reached the end of the 
street. 

We lost him for a short time 
then. He had gone down into the 
last house. A few minutes later 
when a guard in front of the door 
stumbled abruptly backward and 
disappeared inside. 

Another moment passed and the 
guard reappeared. He walked 
briskly up two streets before we be- 
came aware of what had happened. 
The * alien had changed to the 
guard’s clothes! 

That would not take him far, of 
course. At the beginning of the 
third street he was. stopped by two 
sentries. When they demanded a 
password, he whipped his sword out 
from beneath his cloak and ran the 
nearest through. The second shout- 
ed for help and drew his own 
sword. He offered only a moment 
of resistance. We saw then the 
alien’s reason for grinding down the 
long sword. He handled it almost 
like a whip, and the sentry was un- 
able to parry his swift thrusts. 

As I noted the councilors’ ex- 
change of wondering glances I un- 


derstood that a new weapons con- 
cept had been bom. 

When the second sentry fell, the 
alien sprinted into the house, and 
reappeared a minute later on the 
roof. Soon he was a block away 
from the scene of the fight. 

The sentries at the second inter- 
section had run back in answer to 
the shout for help, and the alien 
was able to cross the street un- 
molested. Once again he took to the 
roof, and when he came down 
again he had reached the Building 
Administrates. He was directly be- 
low us! 

We followed him on the screen 
as he ran down the stairs to the 
basement. A sound from the front 
of the building attracted our atten- 
tion and we switched back. Two 
sentinels had not been caught off 
guard. They had spotted him enter- 
ing Administrates and were follow- 
ing closely. 

We switched back to the fugitive, 
and just in time. He had dragged 
himself almost all the way under 
the bottom ramp of the stairs. Soon 
he had disappeared entirely. Now 
the sentinals were looking about in 
a confused way. 

I heard Srtes beside me sigh 
heavily as he rose to his feet. “Do 
you realize,” he asked no one in 
particular, “that he is already half- 
way through? All our calculations 
pointed to the odds being heavily 
against his reaching this far.” 

“The sentinels will find him in a 
few minutes,” one of the councilors 
said reassuringly. 

“Of course they will!” Srtes re- 
plied angrily. “But he was not sup- 
posed to be able to get this far.” 

CHARLES V. DE VET 


42 



T HE ALIEN stayed beneath the 
ramp only until his pursuers 
ran past. Immediately after, he re- 
appeared and strode without hesita- 
tion toward the nearest air vent. 
The screen stuck when he gripped 
its spokes and tried to turn it, but 
he exerted his strength and it gave 
slowly. He pulled it from its frame 
and let it rest on the floor. 

Pushing his feet through the vent 
opening, still clutching the screen, 
he let himself down. Soon his feet 
came to rest on the inside ledge of 
the air tunnel and he balanced there 
as he screwed the screen back into 
place. He had vanished by the time 
the sentinels came running back. 

“By the great hound of Hagras!” 
a councilor exclaimed. “Is there no 
end to the creature’s ingenuity?” 
None of us paid any attention to 
him ; we were too busy watching the 
scene below. Only Sites spoke. 
“Will the fools have brains enough 
to look for him down there?” he 
muttered. The excitement of the 
chase had obviously gripped him 
also. He clicked on a control button 
that split the screen into two scenes, 
and we were able to watch the ac- 
tivity above, as well as in the tun- 
nels below. 

We had no trouble following the 
flight of the alien. The lining of the 
tunnels had been prepared with a 
luminous coating that gave enough 
light for us to see the inside clearly. 

As we watched, the alien stum- 
bled and fell to the floor. He lay 
for a long moment, too weary to 
rise. By this time he must be ex- 
hausted. His stamina had already 
proven greater than we had antic- 
ipated. 

SPECIMEN 


He rose again and walked dog- 
gedly on, searching absent-minded- 
ly in his pockets as he went. I knew 
he must be hungry and thirsty. He 
was probably only now remember- 
ing the packet he had lost early in 
his flight. But he did not slow his 
steady progress forward. 

On the right half of the screen 
we noted that the captain of the 
sentinels had evidently figured out 
what had happened. Up ahead his 
men were hurrying into the numer- 
ous branches of the air tunnel and 
blocking every passage. As they had 
probably been ordered, they began 
walking slowly back. We kept our 
attention on the one who would 
intercept the fugitive. 

The alien stopped occasionally 
and stood listening. Once he paused 
longer than usual. Was his hearing 
that good, I wondered, or was he 
just being cautious? After a minute 
he moved forward again, until only 
a fairly long bend in the tunnel 
branch separated him from the on- 
coming sentinel. 

This time he did hear his inter- 
ceptor. He ran quickly back, keep- 
ing a close observation on the wall 
to his left as he went. Soon he 
found the hiding place he sought. 
Probably he had noted it in passing 
before, and had kept it in mind for 
an emergency of this kind. 

Where he stopped a connection 
in the sheet metal lining the tunnel 
had come loose and a dark space 
gaped open. He crawled inside. 

The man was stupid, I thought, 
if he expected the sentinel to pass 
without noticing the hiding place. 

The sentinel was not stupid. But 
then, we soon found out, neither 

43 



was the alien. 

When the sentinel came to the 
opening he paused and jabbed ten- 
tatively into the dark cavity with 
the long sword that he carried in his 
hand. An instant later he stumbled 
forward, his knees gave beneath 
him, and he sagged to the floor. 

After a moment the alien 
emerged. A portion of his cloak was 
wrapped around one hand, his 
sword in the other. We understood 
then what had happened. He had 
grasped the sentinel’s sword in his 
padded hand and jerked him for- 
ward, at the same time thrusting 
out with his own weapon. The sen- 
tinel had been wounded critically. 

However, the alien himself had 
not escaped unscathed. As he un- 
buttoned his jacket we could see a 
large spot of blood on the lighter 
surface of his blouse. He took a 
white cloth from a rear pocket of 
his trousers and pressed it between 
his jacket and the wound. When he 
went on this time he was very 
weary, obviously dredging up the 
last dregs of his strength. 

In the short pause from action 
of the screen I looked around me. 
I was the only one in the room still 
sitting. The others had been unable 
to keep their seats during the ex- 
citement of watching the flight of 
the fighting alien. Some stood tense- 
ly or leaned against the walls, others 
paced restlessly, and one knelt on 
his hassock. 

^1 returned my attention to the 
outside half of the screen. The cap- 
tain of the sentinels was letting gas 
into the tunnel! 

I felt a pang of regret. This was 


the beginning of the end. I won- 
dered then if the alien did not have 
some inkling by this time that there 
was more to this than a mere seek- 
ing of revenge by Ctvar’s kinsmen. 

He went on only a few strides 
farther before he detected the gas. 
Even then his ingenuity did not 
desert him. As he stood with his 
nostrils spread a noise above him 
caused him to look up. He spied a 
metal covered opening into the tun- 
nel directly over his head. A dozen 
sentinels, I saw with a side glance, 
were grouped around it. 

After only a brief hesitation the 
alien returned to the Zade he had 
wounded a few minutes before. The 
man had ceased to move. Evidently 
he was dead. 

The alien tossed the dead sen- 
tinel across his shoulders and car- 
ried him to the spot beneath the 
metal cover. Here he reached up 
and tapped sharply. The cover 
moved back cautiously, and the 
alien rammed the corpse upward, 
head foremost. 

The body struck the cover and 
knocked it aside. The alien shoved 
it a bit higher, and it quivered as 
the swords above pierced it. 

He dropped the dead carcass and 
sprinted forward. He had bought 
all the time he could, and there was 
nothing for him to do now except 
try to reach the end of the tunnel 
before the gas overcame him. His 
head was held high as he ran — he 
had deduced that they had to use 
a heavier- than-air gas. He did not 
have far to go. 

He reached the end of the tunnel 
and stumbled onto a conduit lead- 
ing from the main air compressor.

44 



For a short time he lay sprawled 
across the metal duct, too e^diausted 
to move. Finally he raised his head 
and looked wearily about him. He 
spied a vent opening on a level 
with his head, and with a deter- 
mined effort he removed the screen 
and climbed through. Utter fatigue 
showed in line of his body. 

Outside he stood for several min- 
utes, drawing clean air deep into 
his lungs. There were no sentries 
here. They had not expected him 
to get this far. But they would 
come, soon after they failed to flush 
him from the tunnel. 

The alien looked about, then 
headed unerringly toward the sand 
banked against the wall of the 
pumping station. He dug until he 
had made a long hollow then let his 
weary body fall into the shallow 
place and began piling sand over 
his legs. When he had covered all 
of himself except one arm, he bur- 
rowed it down until he was com- 
pletely hidden from sight. 

“How can such a man be 
stopped ?” Srtes asked. His face was 
drawn and gray, as though he had 
suffered some great defeat. 

T HE ALIEN must have dropped 
off to sleep for he stayed in the 
sand for several hours, and did not 
emerge until shortly before day- 
light. Evidently he had first made 
an opening through which to ob- 
serve, for there were no guards 
about when he stood up and shook 
the sand from his body. 

He must also have studied all his 
surroundings. He had reached the 
city’s end. The wall ahead of him 


was without a gate. He had been 
sent on a foredoomed errand. 
Though I had been acting under 
orders, I felt a kind of shame at the 
part I had played in the deception. 

Even then, however, he was not 
defeated. He struck out without 
delay to his right where there were 
few sentries, using his rooftop tech- 
nique when needed, and reached a 
side gate within an hour. He dis- 
patched the final sentry by drop- 
ping on him from a convenient 
balcony — he was probably too ex- 
hausted to risk a fight — and let 
himself out through the gate. 

He walked with jaded steps back 
the way he had come, skirting the 
outside wall closely. At last he 
reached the meadow for which he 
had started seven hours earlier. 

He must have guessed before this 
that the story of the waiting space 
ship was a hoax. But, giving the 
last of his strength, and hoping 
against hope, he had fought his 
way there. When the first rays of 
the morning sun showed him that 
the meadow was bare and empty 
his raw courage deserted him. He 
fell face forward on the red sand. 

“I suggest we conclude our proj- 
ect with a final vote before we 
leave,” Srtes said, a few minutes 
after we watched the alien come to 
the end of his resources. “I am cer- 
tain no one of you can have any 
doubts as to what our decision must 
be.” His passive face betrayed no 
emotion. 

“Our plan, decided on soon after 
we learned of the Humans’ exist-

T HE MAJOR league baseball 
season of 1998 was only two 
weeks old, and Manager Pops Pop- 
pinger wished it was over and done 
with. Since opening day his Pirates 
had managed to lose fourteen 
games while winning none, and 
Pops had only the Baseball Man- 
agers’ Tenure Act of 1993 to thank 
for the fact that he was still gain- 
fully employed. As a matter of fact, 
he had that same Act to thank for 
his regular paychecks during the 
1996 and 1997 seasons. 

“But it can’t last,” he muttered. 
“Congress will repeal the thing, and 
cite me as the reason.” 

He strode through the locker 
room without a glance at his loung- 
ing ballplayers, entered his private 
office, and slammed the door. If a 
Do Not Disturb sign had been 
available, he would have hung it 
out. He did not want to talk to any- 
one, especially to anyone wearing 
the uniform of the Pirates. 

He dropped an armful of news- 
papers on his desk, tilted back in 
his chair until he could get his size 
thirteen feet in a comfortable posi- 
tion, and opened the top paper to 
the sports pages. The headline 
made him wince. “WHEN IS A 
PIRATE?” it demanded. 

“In the venerable days of yore,” 
the article said, “when professional 
baseball organizations found it nec- 
essary to attach themselves to some 
unfortunate city in the mistaken 
belief that civic loyalty would in- 
duce the population to attend 
games in person and pay for the 
privilege, die fair city of Pittsburg 
spawned the baseball Pirates. The 
record book says, if you care to be- 

48 


lieve it, that back in the sixties the 
Pirates won five consecutive world 
championships. 

“Those days of myth and fable 
are far behind us. The Pirates 
wouldn’t know how to take a game 
as a gift. They amply demonstrated 
this yesterday, when their opposi- 
tion was stricken with paralytic 
generosity. The Dodgers committed 
six errors and presented the Pirates 
with nine unearned runs. But the 
Pirates lost, twenty-seven to nine.” 
Pops carefully folded the paper, 
and tossed it over his shoulder. 
“Bah!” he said, striking a match. 
He puffed deeply. “Let ’em rave. I 
ain’t got any ballplayers, but I got 
lots of tenure.” He reached for an- 
other paper. “PIRATES STILL IN 
REVERSE,” a headline said. Pops 
tossed that one aside without read- 
ing it. 

A knock rattled the door, and 
Dipsey Marlow, the Pirates’ third- 
base coach, opened it a crack and 
stuck in his large, grinning face. 
“Scram!” Pops snapped. 

“Some kid here to see you, Pops.” 
“Tell him I got a bat boy.” 
“Oh, he’s older than that — I 
think. He’s got a letter for you.” 
Pops straightened up, and 
grinned. “From Congress?” 

“It’s from Pete Holloway.” 
“Send him in.” 

The kid shuffled in awkwardly. 
He was not taller than five-feet- 
five, and he looked just about five- 
feet-five wide. He was not fat — in 
fact, there was an unhealthy thin- 
ness about his freckled face, and his 
overly large ears gave his features a 
whimsical grotesqueness. His was 
the original square build. He was 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



shaped like a box, and he moved 
like one. He dragged to a stop in 
front of Pops’ desk, fumbled 
through four pockets, and came up 
with a letter. 

“Mr. Poppinger?” 

The high, squeeky voice made 
Pops’ ears ring. “I’m ashamed to 
admit it,” he said. “But I am.” 

“Mr. Holloway told me to give 
this to you.” 

“The last I heard of Pete Hol- 
loway, he was lost in the woods up 
in Maine.” 

“He still is, sir. I mean, he still 
lives in Maine.” 

“You came clear out here to 
California just to give me this?” 

“Yes, sir.” 

Pops took the envelope, and 
ripped it open. 

“Dear Pops,” he read. “This here 
kid Zile is the most gawdawful ball- 
player I ever see on two legs. He is 
also the luckiest man south of the 
north pole. Put him out in center 
with a rocking chair and a bottle of 
beer and every ball hit to the out- 
field will drop right in his lap. He’ll 
even catch some of them. Sign him, 
and you’ll win the pennant. Yours, 
Pete. P.S. He is also lucky with the 
bat.” 

Pops scratched his head, and 
squinted unbelievingly at Zile. 
“What d’ya play?” 

“Outfield,” Zile said, and quick- 
ly corrected himself. “Outfield, sir.” 

“Where in the outfield?” 

“Anywhere, sir. Just so it’s the 
outfield, sir.” 

Pops wasn’t certain whether he 
should throw him out, or go along 
with the gag. “I got three outfield- 
ers that get by. How about second 

WHO'S ON FIRST 


or short? Between first and third I 
got nothing but grass.” 

“Oh, no sir. Mr. Holloway had 
me play short, and I made nine 
errors in one inning. Then he 
moved me to the outfield.” 

“I’m surprised he didn’t kill 
you,” Pops said. “But you played 
for Pete?” 

“Yes, sir. Last summer, sir. I 
went to see him a week ago to find 
out when I could start playing 
again, and he said he thought you 
could use me, because your season 
started before his did.” 

“What’d you bat?” 

“Six forty, sir.” 

Pops winced. “What’d you 
field?” 

“A thousand, sir. In the outfield. 
It was — zero, in the infield.” 

Pops got up slowly. “Son, Pete 
Holloway is an old friend of mine, 
and he never gave me a bad tip 
yet. I’ll give you a tryout.” 

“That’s very kind of you, sir.” 
“The name is Pops. And it ain’t 
kind of me, after what happened 
yesterday.” 

P OPS was standing in the corner 
of the dugout with Ed Schwartz, 
the club secretary, when the new 
Pirate walked out onto the field. 
Pops took one look, clapped his 
hand to his forehead, and gasped, 
“My God!” 

“Okay,” Ed said. “You told me 
you wanted to use him. I told you 
I d find him a uniform. I didn’t 
guarantee to find him one that fit. 
He just isn’t made the way our 
uniforms are made, and if I were 
you I’d make sure I wanted to keep 


49 



him before I called the tailor.” 

Pops walked over to the third- 
base coaching box, where Dipsey 
Marlow was standing watching bat- 
ting practice. The Brooklyn dugout 
had just gotten its first incredulous 
look at Zilo, and Pops waited until 
the uproar faded somewhat before 
he spoke. 

“Think Pete is pulling my leg?” 
he said. 

“It wouldn’t be like Pete, but it’s 
possible.” 

“The way things is going, he 
ought to know better. I’ll look him 
up when the season is over, and 
shoot him.” 

Dipsey grinned happily. He 
seemed rather pleased with him- 
self, in spite of yesterday’s loss. As 
third-base coach he’d been the lone- 
liest man in the western hemisphere 
for seven straight days while the 
Pirates were being shut out without 
a man reaching third. Even if the 
Pirates were losing, he liked to have 
some traffic to direct. 

“You got nothing to lose but ball 
games,” he said. 

Zilo had taken his place in the 
batter’s box. He cut on the first 
pitch, and the ball dribbled weakly 
out towards the pitcher’s mound. 

“Like swatting flies,” Dipsey 
said. 

Zilo poked two more lazy ground 
balls back at the pitcher, and lifted 
a pop fly to the third baseman. Ap- 
parently satisfied, he borrowed a 
glove and wandered out to left field. 
He dropped a couple of balls that 
were hit right at him, and if a ball 
wasn’t hit right at him he couldn’t 
get near it. 

“It’s a joke,” Pops said. “Pete 
50 


must have seen him catch one. 
That’s what he means by him being 
lucky.” 

Dipsey walked out to left field 
to talk with Zilo. He came back 
looking foolish. “The kid says it’s 
all right — he’s just testing the at- 
mosphere, or something like that. 
It’ll be different when the game 
starts.” 

“He says he hit six forty,” Pops 
said dreamily. 

“You going to use him?” 

“Sure I’ll use him. If I’m gonna 
shoot Pete, I gotta have a reason 
that’ll stand up in court. As soon 
as we get ten runs behind, in he 
goes.” 

Pops headed back towards the 
dugout, and the tourists that were 
trickling into the grandstand lifted 
a lusty chorus of boos. Pops 
scowled, and ducked into the dug- 
out out of sight. The dratted tour- 
ists were ruining the game. There 
had been a time when a manager 
could concentrate on what he was 
doing, but how was he supposed to 
concentrate with a mob of howling 
spectators literally hanging over his 
shoulder and shouting advice and 
comments into his ear? It got on 
the players’ nerves, too. There was 
the Giants’ Red Cowan, who’d 
been a good pitcher until they 
opened the games to tourists. The 
noise rattled him so he had to re- 
tire. And now so many tourists were 
showing up that they were talking 
about enlarging the stands. 

“Why can’t they stay home and 
see it on TV, like everybody else?” 
Pops growled. 

“Because they pay money, that’s 
why,” Ed Schwartz said. “There’s 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



a novelty or something in seeing a 
ball game in the flesh, and it’s get- 
ting so some of these tourists are 
planning their vacations just so 
they can do that. Bill Willard — 
you know, the L.A. Times man — 
he was saying about half of these 
tourists come to California just to 
see a few National League games. 
The American League is getting the 
same treatment over in Arizona. 
And it’s getting more profitable 
every year.” 

“I don’t mind their watching,” 
Pops said, “if only they’d keep their 
mouths shut. When I first came up, 
there was never anyone around 
during a game except the TV men, 
and they never shouted. Even the 
newspaper men watched on TV. 
Now they camp here during the 
season, and you can’t go out after 
the morning paper without finding 
one on the steps waiting for an in- 
terview.” 

“You might as well get used to 
it. They’re even talking about put- 
ting up some hotels for the tourists, 
so they won’t have to commute 
from Fresno to sec the games.” 

Pops sat down and borrowed Ed’s 
pen to make out his lineup. Ed 
looked over his shoulder, and said, 
“How come you’re not using that 
new guy?” 

“I’m saving him,” Pops said, 
“until we get far enough behind.” 

“You mean until the second in- 
ning,” Ed said, and ducked as Pops 
fired a catcher’s mask. 

The game started off in a way 
sadly familiar to Pops. The Dodgers 
scored three runs in the first inning, 
and were threatening to blast the 

WHO'S ON FIRST 


Pirates clear out of the league. 
With the bases loaded and one out, 
the Pirate third baseman managed 
to hang onto a sizzling line drive 
and turn it into a double play. Pops 
sank back and breathed easier, but 
not for long. Lefty Effinger, the 
Pirate pitcher, spent the afternoon 
falling out of one hole into an- 
other. In nine innings he gave up a 
total of seventeen hits, but a mirac- 
ulous series of picked-off runners, 
overrun bases and double plays 
kept the Dodgers shut out after 
those first three runs. 

In the meantime, Dodger pitcher 
Rube Ruster was having one of his 
good days. He gave up a scratch 
single in the second and a walk in 
the fourth, and by the ninth in- 
ning he had fanned twelve, to the 
general amusement of the hooting, 
jeering tourists. 

The last of the ninth opened with 
Ruster striking out the first two 
Pirates on six pitches, and the 
Pirates in the dugout started sneak- 
ing off to the dressing room. Then 
first baseman Sam Lyle ducked 
away from an inside pitch. It hit 
his bat, and blooped out over the 
infield lor a single. Pops called for 
the hit-and-run, and the next bat- 
ter bounced a perfect double-play 
ball at the Dodger shortstop. The 
shortstop threw the ball into right 
field, and the runners got to second 
and third. Ruster paced angrily 
about the mound, and then walked 
the next batter on four pitches. 

Pops jumped out of the dugout, 
and called time. He searched the 
bench, and saw Zilo looking at him 
expectantly from the far end. “Hit 
six forty, did he?” Pops muttered, 


51 



and yelled, “Zilo!” 

Zilo bounced up, beaming. “Yes, 

• OJJ 

sirr 

“Get out there and hit!” 

“Yes, sir!” 

He shuffled out towards the plate, 
and the uproar the tourists sent up 
when they saw him rocked the 
grandstand. From the third-base 
coaching box, Dipsey Marlow 
called time again, and hurried over 
to the dugout. 

“You off your rocker? We got a 
chance to win this one.” 

“I know.” 

“Then let’s get that thing out of 
there, and use a left hander.” 

“Look,” Pops said. “You know 
derned well the way Ruster is 
pitching we’re lucky to get a foul 
off of him. That hit was luck, and 
the error was luck, and the base on 
balls happened only because Ruster 
got mad. He’ll cool off, now, and 
the only thing that keeps this going 
is luck. Pete says the kid’s lucky. I 
want some of that luck.” 

Marlow turned on his heel, and 
went back to his coaching box. 

Ruster coiled up and shot a bullet 
at home plate. Zilo swatted at it 
awkwardly — and popped it up. 

The second baseman backed up 
three steps, waved the rest of the 
infield away, and got ready to end 
the game. The Pirate baserunners, 
running furiously with two out, 
came down the stretch from third 
in a mournful procession. Zilo loped 
along the base path, watching the 
Dodger second baseman and the 
ball. 

The ball reached the top of its 
arc, and suddenly seemed to carry. 
The second baseman backed con- 


fidently into position, changed his 
mind, and backed up again. Sud- 
denly he whirled and raced towards 
center field with his eyes on the 
misbehaving ball. The centerfielder 
had already trotted in towards the 
infield, and he picked up speed and 
came on at a rush. The second 
baseman leaped for the ball. The 
centerfielder dove for it. Neither 
man touched it, and they went 
down in a heap as the ball frolicked 
away. 

The lumbering Zilo crossed home 
plate before the startled rightfielder 
could get to the ball. The Pirates 
had won, four to three, and they 
hoisted Zilo to their shoulders and 
bore him off to the dressing room. 

Pops went over to the Dodger 
dugout to claim the ball. When he 
came back, he found Dipsey Mar- 
low still standing in his third-base 
coaching box, staring vacantly to- 
wards the outfield. 

“Luck,” Pops said, and gently 
led him away. 

R ODNEY WILKS, the Pirates’ 
brisk little president, flew over 
from L. A. that evening and threw 
a victory celebration in the ultra- 
modern building that housed the 
National League Offices. All the 
Pirates were there, and those that 
had families brought them. Women 
and children congregated in one 
room and the men in another. 
Champagne and milk shakes flowed 
freely in both rooms. 

National League President Edgar 
Rysdale looked in on the party 
briefly, beaming approval. A team 
in a slump was bad for all the 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 


52 



teams — bad for the league. When 
the race was a good one, fans fre- 
quently paid a double TV fee, 
watching two games at once, or, if 
they had only one set, switching 
back and forth. If one team was 
floundering, National League fans 
would watch only one game — or 
none. They might even patronize 
the American League. So President 
Rysdale was not unhappy, and nei- 
ther were the other owners, who 
stopped by to sample the cham- 
pagne and talk shop with Wilks. 

Even Fred Carter, the Dodger 
Manager, did not seem mournful, 
though Zilo’s freak pop fly had 
ruined a nine-game winning streak 
for him. He backed Pops into a 
corner, and said with a grin, “I 
been watching pop flies for thirty- 
five years, and I never saw one act 
like that. 55 

Pops shrugged. “I been watching 
baseball forty-five years, and I see 
something new seven times a 
week.” 

“Just the same, the next time 
that kid comes up, I pass out the 
butterfly nets. He don’t look like a 
hitter. Where’d you get him?” 

“Pete Holloway sent him out.” 

Carter arched his eyebrows. “He 
must have something, then.” 

“Pete says he ain’t got a thing 
except luck.” 

“Ain’t that enough? Think I’ll 
go over and watch the Reds and 
the Giants. Want to come?” 

“Nope. Now that I finally won 
one, I’m gonna get some sleep to- 
night.” 

Pops saw Ed Schwartz talking 
with Zilo, and he wandered over 
to see what line the club secretary 

WHO'S ON FIRST 


might be handing out. Ed was talk- 
ing about the old days, and Zilo 
was listening intently, his eyes 
sparkling. 

“Each team had its own city,” 
Ed said, “and its own ball park. 
Think of the waste that involved. 
There were always four parks that 
weren’t in use, and more when day 
and night games were mixed up. 
Then there was all that traveling 
expense. Our hotel bill for the sea- 
son used to look like the national 
debt, and the train and plane fares 
weren’t any better. It was rough on 
the players, too, with all that trav- 
eling, and getting traded just as 
they got settled somewhere, or may- 
be trying to keep up one home dur- 
ing baseball season, and another 
one between seasons. Putting the 
entire league in one place solved 
everything. The climate is wonder- 
ful, and we almost never have a 
game postponed because of bad 
weather. We have two fields, and 
they’re used twice a day, for two 
afternoon and two night games. 
Each club has its own little com- 
munity where its personnel lives. 
Baseball, California, is growing, 
boy, and lots of players are settling 
here permanently and buying their 
own homes. You’ll want to, too. It’s 
a wonderful place.” 

“It’s a soft place for club secre- 
taries,” Pops growled. “Ed used to 
have to worry about baggage, train 
schedules, hotel reservations, and a 
million and one other things. Now 
all he has to do is get the equip- 
ment moved a couple of hundred 
yards from one park to the other, 
now and then, and he gripes about 
it. Has he stopped talking long 


53 



enough to get you settled?” 

“Oh, yes, sir,” Zilo said. “I’m 
rooming with Jerry Fargo.” 

“All right. Gome out early to- 
morrow. You gotta learn to catch a 
fly ball without getting hit on the 
head.” 

Dipsey Marlow nudged Pops’ 
arm, and pulled him aside. “Going 
to play him tomorrow?” 

“Might. We could use a little 
luck every day.” 

“I been listening to the big boys. 
Know what they’re going to do? 
Put up a flock of temporary stands 
at World Series time. They think 
they might get fifteen thousand 
people out here for every game.” 
“That’s their business,” Pops 
said. 

“Just tell me why anyone wants 
to take a trip and pay a stiff price 
to see a ball game, when he can 
sit at home in his easy chair and 
see it for fifty cents?” 

“People are funny,” Pops said. 
“Sometimes almost as funny as ball 
players.” 

President Wilks came over and 
placed a full glass in Pops’ hand. 
Pops sipped the champagne, and 
grimaced. “It’s all right, I guess. 
But it’ll never take the place of 
beer.” 

“Finish in first division,” Wilks 
said, “and I’ll buy you enough beer 
to take you through the off season.” 
Pops grinned. “How about put- 
ting that in my contract?” 

“I’ll take care of it first thing in 
the morning.” He grinned and 
prodded Pops in the ribs, but be- 
hind the grin his expression was 
anxious. “Do you think we have a 
chance?” 

54 


“Too early to say. Sure, we only 
won one out of fifteen, but we’re 
only ten games out of first. If we 
snap out of it — well, the season’s 
got a long way to go.” 

“I hope you snap out of it,” 
Wilks said. “Managers have tenure, 
but presidents haven’t.” 

Pops found a bottle of beer to 
kill the taste of the champagne, and 
he made a quiet exit after instruct- 
ing Marlow to get the players 
home to bed at a reasonable hour. 
The National League’s two playing 
fields were a blaze of light, and the 
shouts of the two crowds inter- 
mingled. There seemed to be a lot 
of tourists on hand. Pops walked 
slowly back to Pirateville, grum- 
bling to himself. 

He passed the mansion which 
had been designed for the manager, 
and which he had turned over to 
Dipsey Marlow, who needed space 
for his eight kids. Pops lived in a 
smaller house a short distance down 
the street. His middle-aged daugh- 
ter Marge kept house for him, and 
she was already in bed when he got 
home. She didn’t like baseball.

P OPS OPENED a three-game 
series against the Cubs with 
Zilo in left field. He figured the 
youngster would do the least 
damage there, since he was pitch- 
ing Simp Simpson, his best right 
hander, and the Cubs had seven 
left-handed batters in their lineup. 
His strategy seemed to be sound. In 
the first six innings only two balls 
were hit to left. One was a line 
drive single, which Zilo hobbled for 
an error as the runner reached 
second. The other was a foul fly 
on which Zilo seemed about to 
make a miraculous catch until his 
feet got tangled up and spilled him. 
At the plate he waved his bat futile- 
ly and struck out twice while the 
Cubs were taking a five-run lead. 

In the last of the sixth the Pirates 
got men on first and second, and 
it was Zilo’s turn to bat. Dipsey 
Marlow called time, and as the 
tourists hooted he strode back to 
the dugout. “Take him out,” he 
said. 

“Why?” Pops said. “He’s still 
batting .333. That’s better than 
anyone else on this team.” 

“You gotta understand this luck 


thing. Yesterday it was luck to put 
him in. Today it’s luck to take him 
out. I found a spider in my locker, 
today, and that means ...” 

“Hit and run on the first pitch,” 
Pops said. 

Zilo fanned the air lustily, and 
dribbled a grounder down to the 
first baseman. As he reached for 
the ball, it took an unaccountable 
eight-foot bounce over his head, 
and rolled into the outfield, picking 
up speed. Zilo pulled up at first, 
breathing heavily, and the two run- 
ners scored. 

Sam Lyle followed with a lazy 
fly ball to right. Zilo moved off 
first base, and halted to watch the 
progress of the ball. The right field- 
er seemed to be having difficulties. 
He wandered about shading his 
eyes, backed up, finally lost the ball 
in the sun. The center fielder had 
come over fast, and he shouted the 
right fielder away, backed up slow- 
ly, and finally turned in disgust to 
watch the ball drop over the fence. 
Lyle trailed the floundering Zilo 
around the bases, and the score 
was five to four. 

Three fast outs later, Dipsey 
Marlow returned to the dugout and 
squeezed in beside Pops. “I take it 
back,” he said. “I won’t argue with 
you again the rest of the season. 
But that spider of mine . 

Pops cupped his hands, and 
shouted. “Let’s hold ’em, now! Let’s 
win this one!” 

“. this spider of mine was in 
my sweat shirt, and my old mother 
always used to say spider in your 
clothes means money . .” 

“We got two hundred twenty- 
four games to go,” Pops said. “Get 


WHO'S ON FIRST 


55 



to work, and pick us off a sign or 
two.” 

Zilo came up again in the eighth, 
and got a rally started with a pop 
fly that three infielders chased fu- 
tilely. He got to second on a ground 
ball that took a bad hop, and 
scored on a soft line drive that 
curved sharply and landed between 
the outfielders. Two more runs 
scored on hits that were just about 
as unlikely, and the Pirates took a 
two-run lead into the ninth. 

The Cubs came back with a 
vengence. The first two batters 
lashed out sizzling singles. Pops 
prodded his bullpen into action, and 
went out to talk to Simpson. They 
stood looking down on the next 
Cub batter, the burly catcher Bugs 
Rice. 

“Don’t let him pull one,” Pops 
said. 

“He won’t pull one,” Simp said 
determinedly, through clenched 
teeth. 

Rice did not pull one. He didn’t 
have to. He unloaded on the first 
pitch, and drove it far, far away 
into left field, the opposite field. 
Pops sat down with the crack of 
the bat, and covered his face with 
his hands. 

Suddenly the men on the bench 
broke into excited cheers, and there 
was a scattering of applause from 
the tourists. Pops looked up, saw 
runners on second and third, saw 
the scoreboard registering one out. 

“What happened ?” he yelled. 

“Zilo caught it,” Dipsey Marlow 
said. “Took so much time getting 
the ball back to the infield that the 
runners had time to touch up and 
advance, but he caught it.” 


“He didn’t. I know a homerun 
when I see one, and that ball was 
gone. I can tell by the way it 
sounds, and I can tell by the way it 
leaves the bat. I heard that one,' 
and I saw it go. It should have 
cleared the fence by twenty feet.” 
“Your eyes aren’t as young as 
they used to be. Zilo caught it back 
by the fence.” 

Pops shook his head. He huddled 
down in a corner of the dugout 
while Simpson fanned one batter 
and got another on a tap to the in- 
field, and the Pirates had won two 
in a row. 

T HAT WAS the beginning. The 
Pirates pushed their winning 
streak to twelve, lost one, won eight 
more. They were twenty and fif- 
teen, and in fourth place. Zilo be- 
came something of a national sensa- 
tion, and he kept his batting aver- 
age around the .450 mark. He even 
got another home run, on a ball to 
the outfield that took crazy bounces 
in nineteen directions while Zilo 
lumbered around the bases. The 
rest of the team took courage and 
started playing baseball. 

But not even Zilo could carry the 
Pirates above fourth place. Pops’ 
pitching staff was a haphazard as- 
sortment of aching, overage vet- 
erans and unpredictable, inexperi- 
enced youths. On one day they 
would be unhittable; on the next 
they would be massacred, and Pops 
found to his sorrow that not even 
luck can overcome a nineteen-run 
lead. Still, the season drifted along 
with the Pirates holding desperate- 
ly to fourth, and Pops began to

think they might even stay there, if 
the luck held out. 

Then Zilo sprained his ankle. 
The trainer outfitted him with 
crutches and applied every known 
remedy, and a few unknown ones 
that Zilo suggested, but the ankle 
failed to respond. 

“It beats me/’ the trainer said to 
Pops. “Things that should make it 
better seem to make it worse.” 

“How long will he be out?” Pops 
said gloomily. 

“I won’t even guess. The way 
things are going, it’ll last him a life- 
time.” 

Pops breathed a profane farewell 
to first division. 

Zilo attended the games in his 
street clothes, hobbling on his 
crutches to the far end of the dug- 
out where he watched the games 
with silent concentration. Oddly 
enough, for a time the Pirates’ luck 
continued. Ground balls took freak- 
ish bounces, fly balls responded to 
unlikely air currents, and on some 
days opposition pitchers suffered 
such a loss of control that they 
would occasionally wander in and 
stare at home plate, as though to 
assure themselves that it was still 
there. Ollie Richards, the Reds’ ace, 
and one of the best control pitchers 
in either league, walked ten men in 
one inning, and left the game on 
the short end of a six to three score 
without having given up a hit. 

Zilo’s broad, good-natured face 
took on an unhealthy pallor. Wrin- 
kles furrowed his brow, and his eyes 
held a tense, haunted look. The 
Pirates’ luck began to fade, and he 
grew increasingly irritable and de- 
spondent. On the day they slipped 

WHO'S ON FIRST 


to fifth place, he sought out Pops. 

Pops was feeling despondent 
enough himself, that afternoon. The 
Pirates’ pitching had collapsed, and 
for the first time in a month he was 
back in second division. He hurried 
through the dressing room towards 
his office, and Zilo placed a large 
hand on his arm. 

“Could I speak with you, sir?” 
“Sure,” Pops said. “Come along.” 
Pops held the door as Zilo swung 
through on his crutches. He pulled 
out a chair for him, and got him 
seated, and settled back with his 
own feet propped up on his desk. 
“Ankle any better?” 

“I’m afraid not, sir.” 

“Takes time, sometimes.” 

“Sir,” Zilo said, “I know I’m not 
a good ballplayer. Like they say, I’m 
just lucky. Maybe this will be the 
only season I’ll play.” 

“Wouldn’t say that,” Pops said. 
“You’re young. Luck has took a lot 
of men a long way in baseball.” 
“Anyway, sir, I like to play, even 
if I’m not good. And I’d like to 
have us win the pennant and play 
in the World Series.” 

“Wouldn’t mind having another 
winner myself, before I retire.” 
“What I’d like to do, sir, is go 
home for awhile. I think I could 
get my ankle fixed up there, and 
I’d like to bring back some friends 
who could help us.” 

Pops was amused. “Ballplayers?” 
“I think they’d be better than I 
am, sir. Or luckier, maybe. Do you 
— would you give them a trial?” 
“I’ll give anyone a trial,” Pops 
said seriously. “Mosdy shortstops 
and second basemen and pitchers, 
but I’ll have a look at anybody.” 


57 



Zilo pushed himself erect on his 
crutches. “I’ll get back as soon as I 
can.” 

“All right. But leave a little of 
that luck here, will you?” 

Zilo turned, and looked at Pops 
strangely. “I wish I could, sir. I 
really wish I could.” 

Ed Schwartz took Zilo in to L.A., 
and put him on a plane. For Maine. 
And at Baseball, Gal., the Pirates 
won two more games, and went into 
a cataclysmic slump. They lost ten 
straight, and slipped to sixth place. 
Pops put through a phone call to 
the Maine address Zilo had given 
him, and was informed there wasn’t 
such a place. Then he called Pete 
Holloway. 

“I wondered what was happening 
to you,” Pete said. “I haven’t seen 
the kid. He showed up here last 
summer and played a little sandlot 
ball for me. He never told me where 
he came from, but I don’t think it 
was Maine. If he shows up again, 
I’ll get in touch with you.” 

“Thanks,” Pops said, and hung 
up. 

Ed Schwartz sat eyeing him sol- 
emnly. “I suppose I better get a de- 
tective on it.” 

“Detectives,” Pops said, and 
wearily headed for the field and 
another Pirate beating. 

Two more weeks went by. The 
detectives traced Zilo to Maine, 
where he seemed to have vanished 
completely. The Pirates continued 
to lose, and tottered on the brink of 
last place. 

Then Pops received an airmail 
letter from Zilo — from Brazil. 

“I got lost,” he wrote plaintively. 
“Our plane crashed in the jungle, 

58 


and they won’t let us leave the 
country.” 

Pops called President Wilks into 
conference, and President Wilks got 
on the phone to Washington. He 
knew enough of the right people to 
make the necessary arrangements 
and keep the matter out of the pa- 
pers. Zilo was flown back on a char- 
tered plane, and he brought four 
friends with him. 

Ed Schwartz met them in L.A., 
and rushed them out to Baseball in 
President Wilks’ own plane. They 
arrived during the fourth inning of 
another Pirate massacre. 

“How’s the ankle?” Pops de- 
manded. 

Zilo beamed. “Just fine!” 

“Get in there, then.” 

Zilo got his friends seated on the 
bench, and went out to loft a long 
fly ball over the fence for a home 
run. The Pirates came to life. 
Everyone hit, and a ten to nothing 
drubbing was transformed like 
magic into a twenty-five to twelve 
victory. 

After the game, Zilo introduced 
his friends-— John Smith, Sam 
Jones, Robert White and William 
Anderson. Smith and Jones, Zilo 
said, were infielders. White and An- 
derson were pitchers. 

Ed Schwartz had already taken 
in their proportions with a groan, 
and gone to work on the uniform 
problem. Their builds were similar 
to Zilo’s, but there was much more 
of them. They were all about six 
feet six, and they towered over 
Pops, answered his questions polite- 
ly, and showed a child-like interest 
in all that went on about them. 

Pops called one of his catchers 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



over, and introduced him to White 
and Anderson. “See what they got,” 
he said. 

He took Smith and Jones out for 
a little infield practice, and watched 
goggle-eyed as they covered ground 
like jet-propelled gazelles and made 
breath-taking leaps to pull down 
line drives. 

The catcher returned, drew Pops 
aside, and said awesomely, “They 
got curves that break three feet. 
They got sliders that do a little 
loop-the-loop and cross the plate 
twice. They got fast balls that I’m 
scared to catch. They got pitches 
that change speed four times be- 
tween the mound and the plate. If 
you’re figuring on pitching those 
guys, you can get yourself another 
catcher.” 

Pops turned the ceremony of 
signing them over to Ed Schwartz, 
handed releases to four players who 
weren’t worth the space they were 
taking up on the bench, and went 
home to his first good night’s sleep 
in more than a month.

P OPS STARTED Anderson the 
next day, against the Braves. 
The Pirates bounced forty hits over 
and through and around the infield, 
and scored thirty-five runs. Ander- 
son pitched a no-hit game, and 
struck out twenty-seven. White 
duplicated the performance on the 
following day. Thereafter Pops 
worked them into his regular pitch- 
ing rotation. He wasn’t sure 
whether they hypnotized everyone 
on the field, or just the ball, but as 
Dipsey Marlow put it, they made 
the ball do everything but stop and 
back up. 

Pops’ regular pitchers suddenly 
began to look like champions with 
Smith and Jones playing behind 
them. In spite of their awkward 
builds, they ranged about the infield 
with all of the agility of jack rab- 
bits. No one ever measured exactly 
how high they went up after line 
drives, but one sports writer claimed 
they were a hazard to air traffic, 
and should be licensed as aircraft. 
They sped far into the outfield after 
fly balls. Jones playing second, made 
more catches in right field than the 
right fielder, and it was not an un- 
usual sight to see Jones and Smith 
both out in center field contesting 
the right to a descending ball while 
the center fielder made a hasty re- 
treat. And both swung murderous 
bats. 

The Pirates had won fifty-seven 
games in a row and rewritten the 
record book when Zilo timidly 


59 



knocked on the door of Pops’ office. 
He was carrying a newspaper, and 
he looked disturbed. 

“Sir,” he said anxiously, “it says 
here that we’re ruining baseball.” 

Pops chuckled. “They always say 
that when one team starts to pull 
away.” 

“But — is it true?” 

“Well, now — if we kept on win- 
ning the way we are now, we 
wouldn’t do the game any good. 
People like to see a close race, and 
if one team wins too much, or loses 
too much, a lot of people stop 
watching the games. And that ain’t 
good. But don’t let it worry you. 
We’ll do our best to go on winning, 
and we’re still going to drop a few, 
one of these days, and things will 
be back to normal. Your friends 
been playing over their heads and 
we’ve been luckier than usual. That 
can’t last forever.” 

“I see,” Zilo said thoughtfully. 

That evening Pops ruefully 
wished he’d kept his mouth shut. 
Talking about a slump when you’re 
winning . 

Anderson got knocked out in the 
first inning, and lost his first game. 
White failed the next day, and the 
Pirates dropped five straight. Then 
they got off on another winning 
streak, but the talk about their ruin- 
ing the game had quieted down. 
Pops never bothered to remind Zilo 
how right he’d been. He wasn’t go- 
ing to open his big mouth and jinx 
the team again. 

“Those baseball players of yours,” 
his daughter said to him one eve- 
ning. “You know — the funny-look- 
ing ones.” 

60 


“Sure I know,” Pops said. “What 
about ’em?” 

“They’re supposed to be pretty 
good, aren’t they?” 

Pops grinned wickedly. “Pretty 
fair,” he said. It would have been a 
waste of time referring Marge to 
the record book — or what was left 
of it, now. 

“I was over at the bowling alley 
with Ruth Wavel, and they were 
there bowling. They had everybody 
excited.” 

“How’d they do?” 

“I guess they must be pretty good 
at that, too. They knocked all the 
pins over.” 

Pops grinned again. Marge’s idea 
of a sport was crossword puzzles, 
and she could go through an entire 
season without seeing a single game. 
The thought of Marge as a bowling 
critic — or any other kind of sports 
critic — amused him. “Nothing un- 
usual about that,” he said. “Hap- 
pens all the time.” 

She seemed surprised. “Does it? 
The people there thought it was 
something special.” 

“How many times did they knock 
all the pins down?” 

“I didn’t count them. They 
knocked them all down every time. 
All evening. It was the first time 
they’d ever played, too.” 

“Natural athletic ability,” Pops 
muttered. He was thinking that 
they’d never played baseball before, 
either, except that Zilo told him 
he’d been coaching them. The more 
he thought about it, the odder it 
seemed, but he was not one to argue 
with no-hit games, and home runs, 
and sensational fielding plays. No 
manager would argue with those.

HE SEASON leveled out into 
a five-team race for first place. 
The Pirates stayed in first or sec- 
ond, playing either with unbeliev- 
able brilliance or with incredible in- 
eptness. Pops took the race stoically 
and shrugged off the tourist hysteria 
that enveloped Baseball, Gal. He 
was doing so much better that he 
had imagined in his wildest mo- 
ments of pre-season optimism that 
it really didn’t matter where he fin- 
ished. He was a cinch to be Man- 
ager of the Year. He might add a 
pennant and a World Series, or he 
might not. But a smart manager 
quits when he’s ahead — especially 
when he’s well along in his sixties. 
Pops called a news conference, and 
announced his retirement at the end 
of the season. 

'‘Before or after the World 
Series?” a reporter called. 

“No comment,” Pops said. 

The club owners erected their 
World Series stands early, and the 
tourists jammed them — fifteen or 
twenty thousand for every game. 
Pops wondered where they came 
from. National League President 
Rysdale wandered about smiling 
fondly over the daily television re- 

WHO'S ON FIRST 


ceipts, and President Wilks sent 
Pops a load of beer that half-filled 
his basement. 

Over in Baseball, Arizona, the 
American League officials were 
glum. The Senators had opened up 
a fifteen-game lead, and nobody 
cared any longer what happened in 
the American League. 

“Three weeks to go,” Pops told 
his team. “What d’ya say we wrap 
this thing up?” 

“Right!” Zilo said happily. 

“Right!” Smith, Jones, Anderson 
and White chorused. 

The Pirates started on another 
winning streak.

When the last week of the season 
opened, the Pirates were in first 
place, five games ahead of the 
Dodgers. A provident schedule put 
the Dodgers and the Pirates in a 
three-game series. With twenty-two 
howling tourists in the stands and 
half of Earth’s population watching 
on TV, White and Anderson put 
together no-hit games and the 
Pirate batters demolished the 
Dodger pitching staff. The Pirates 
took all three games. 

President Wilks threw another 

61 




champagne party, and the sports 
writers backed Pops into a comer 
and fired questions. 

‘ How about that retirement, 
Pops. Still going through with it?” 

“I’ve gone through with it.” 

“Is it true that Dipsey Marlow 
will take your place?” 

“That’s up to the front office. 
They ain’t asked my opinion.” 

“What if they did ask your opin- 
ion?” 

“I’d faint.” 

“Who’ll start the series? Ander- 
son or White?” 

“I’ll flip a coin,” Pops said. “It 
don’t matter.” 

“Going to give the Senators a 
sporting chance, eh?” 

“No comment,” Pops said. 

President Wilks and League 
President Rysdale carried him away 
from the reporters and into the 
league offices. 

“We have a proposal from the 
American League,” Rysdale said. 
“We’d like to know what you think 
of it, and what you think the play- 
ers would think of it. They’d like to 
split up the series, and play part of 
the games here, and part in Ari- 
zona. They think it would stir up 
more local interest.” 

“I wouldn’t like it,” Pops said. 
“What’s wrong with the way it is 
now? Here one year, there the next 
year. What do they want to do — 
travel back and forth between each 
game?” 

“We’d start out with four games 
here, and then play five in Arizona, 
if one team hasn’t won seven by 
then. And if we needed to we’d 
come back here for the last four. 
Next year we’d start out with four 

62 


in Arizona. It used to be done that 
way, years ago.” 

“I like it better the way it is. I 
think the players would, too. One 
ball park is just like another, so why 
change around?” 

“They think we would draw more 
tourists that way than we would 
playing in one place. As far as we’re 
concerned, we’re drawing capacity 
crowds now. It might make a dif- 
ference in Arizona, because they 
haven’t got so many population 
centers over there.” 

“They just thought of it because 
it’s in California this year,” Pops 
said. “Next year they’d want to 
change back.” 

“That’s a thought,” Rysdale said. 
“I think I’ll tell them it’s too late 
to change, but we might consider it 
for next year.” 

“Good,” Pops said. “Next year 
you can play it in Brazil, for all I 
care.” 

In the hallway Pops encountered 
half-a-dozen of his players, crowd- 
ing around infielder Jones. “What’s 
up?” he asked Dipsey Marlow. 

“Just some horsing around. They 
were practicing high jumps, and 
Jones just cleared eight feet.” 

“So?” 

“That’s a world record by some 
ten inches. I just looked it up.”

P OPS RETIRED early the night 
before the series opened, hav- 
ing ordered all of his players to do 
the same. Marge was out some- 
where, but Pops left the night light 
on, and went off to bed. He didn’t 
sleep, but he was relaxing comfort- 
ably when she came in an hour 
later. 

She marched straight through 
the house and into his bedroom. 
“Those ballplayers of yours — the 
funny looking ones — they were at 
the bowling alley!” 

Pops took a deep breath. “They 
were eh^” 

“They’d been drinking!” 

Pops sat up and reached for his 
shoes. “You don’t say.” 

“And they were bowling, only — 
they weren’t bowling. They’d pre- 
tend to throw the ball but they 
wouldn’t throw it, and then the pins 
would fall down anyway. The man- 
ager was mad.” 

“No doubt,” Pops said, pulling 
on his trousers. 

“They wouldn’t tell anyone how 
they did it, but everytime they 
waved the ball all the pins would 
fall down. They’d been drinking.” 
“Maybe that’s how they did it/’ 
Pops said, slipping into his shirt. 
“How?” 

“By drinking.” 

He headed for the bowling alley 
on the dead run. The place was 
crowded with players from other 
tegfte. American and National 
lJfc|£Aie, and quite a few sports 
'^fers were around. The writers 

WHO'S ON FIRST 


headed for Pops, and he shoved 
them aside and found the manager. 

“Who was it?” he demanded. 

“Those four squares of yours. 
Jones, Smith, Anderson, White.” 

“Zilo?” 

“No. Zilo wasn’t here.” 

“Did they make trouble?” 

“Not the way you mean. They 
didn’t get rough, though I had a 
hard time getting them away from 
the alleys. They left maybe ten 
minutes ago.” 

“Thanks,” Pops said. 

“When you find them, ask them 
how they pulled that gag with the 
pins. They were too drunk to tell 

>5 

me. 

“I got some other things to ask 
them,” Pops said. 

He fought his way to a phone 
booth, and called Ed Schwartz. 

“I got you,” Ed said. “They may 
be back at their rooms by now, but 
we won’t take any chances. Don’t 
worry about a thing — I’ll handle 
it.” 

“Sure. I won’t worry about a 
thing.” 

He pushed out through the writ- 
ers, and headed for Bachelor’s 
Paradise, the house where the un- 
married Pirates lived with a couple 
of solicitous houseboys to look after 
them. Ed Schwartz was already 
there. All the players were in bed — 
except Smith, Jones, Anderson, 
White and Zilo. The others knew 
nothing except that Zilo had been 
concerned about his friends’ ab- 
sence, and gone looking for them. 

“You go on home,” Ed said. “I’ll 
find them.” 

Pops paced grimly back and 
forth, taking an occasional kick at 


63 



a piece of furniture. “You find 
them,” he said, “and I'll fine 
them.” 

He went home to bed, but he did 
not sleep. Twice during the night 
he called Ed Schwartz, and Ed was 
out. He got ahold of him at break- 
fast time, and learned that no trace 
of the players had been found. The 
reporters had gotten ahold of the 
story, of course, and the headlines 
mocked Pops over his coffee. 

PIRATE STARS MISSING! 

Ed Schwartz had notified both 
President Wilks and President Rys- 
dale, and President Rysdale had 
called in the F.B.I. The local police 
were out in full strength, President 
Wilks hired some private detectives, 
and by ten o’clock police in every 
city in the country were looking for 
the missing Pirates. 

When Pops got over to the field 
for the late-morning workout there 
was still no word. He banned news- 
men from the field and dressing 
room, told Lefty Effinger he might 
have to start, and went around try- 
ing to cheer up his players. The 
players remembered only too well 
their fourteen game losing streak at 
the beginning of the season, and 
the collapse that had followed Zilo’s 
departure. Gloom hung thickly in 
the Pirates’ dugout. 

An hour before game time, Pops 
was called to the telephone. It was 
Ed Schwartz, in L.A. “I found 
them,” he said. “They’re already 
on their way back. They’ll be there 
in plenty of time.” 

“Good,” Pops said. 

“Bad. They’re still pretty high — 
all except Zilo. I don’t know if you 


can use them, but that’s your prob- 
lem.” 

Pops slammed down the phone. 
“Did they find ’em?” Dipsey 
Marlow said. 

“Found ’em dead drunk.” 
Marlow rubbed his hands to- 
gether. “Just let me at ’em. Ten 
minutes, and I’ll have ’em dead 
sober.” 

“I dunno,” Pops said. “Some- 
how, these guys are different.” 

They made it with time to spare, 
and Dipsey Marlow went to work 
enthusiastically. He started by shov- 
ing the recalcitrant players into a 
cold shower, fully dressed. Zilo 
stood anxiously looking on. 

“I’m sorry,” he said to Pops. “I’d 
have stopped them, but they went 
off without me. And they never had 
any of that alcohol before and they 
didn’t know what it would do to 
them.” 

“That’s all right,” Pops said. “It 
wasn’t your fault.” 

Zilo had tears in his eyes. “Do 
you think they can play?” 

“Just leave ’em to me,” Marlow 
said. “I’m just getting started.” 
They left them to him, and he 
came out later, looking frustrated. 
“I just don’t know,” he said. “They 
tell me they’re all right, but I think 
they’re still drunk.” 

“Gan they play?” Pops asked. 
“They can walk a straight line. I 
won’t say how long a straight line. 
I suppose ycfu got nothing to lose 
by playing them.” 

“There ain’t nothing else I can 
do,” Pops said. “I could start Effin- 
ger, but what could I use for in- 
fielders?”

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



T HERE IS something about a 
World Series. Even Pops, who 
had seen every one for forty-five 
years as player, manager or specta- 
tor, felt a momentary thrill and a 
clutching emptiness in his stomach 
as he moved to the top step of the 
dugout and looked out across the 
sunlit field. The stands, permanent 
and temporary, stretched the full 
length of the foul lines, and they 
were jammed with tourists. The 
Standing Room Only signs were up 
in the box offices, but there really 
wasn’t any of that. 

Ed Schwartz stood at Pops’ el- 
bow, looking at the crowd. “There’s 
something about a hot dog that’s 
different when you buy it at a ball 
park,” he said. 

“Ptomaine,” Pops growled. 
Clutching his lineup, he strode 
towards home plate to meet the 
umpires and Senator Manager Bert 
Basom. 

Basom grinned evilly. “Your men 
well rested? I hear they keep late 
hours.” 

“They’re rested well enough.” 

A few minutes later, with the 
National Anthem played and the 
flag raised, Pops watched critically 
as Anderson took his last warm-up 
pitches. He warmed up lazily, as he 
always did, and if he was feeling 
any after-effects, it wasn’t evident 
to Pops. Feeling better, he returned 
to the dugout. 

But Anderson got off to a shaky 
start. The Senator’s leadoff man 

t ted a tremendous drive back 
left field, but Zilo made one of 
sensational, lumbering catches, 
second batter drove one back 
through the box. Jones started after 

WHO'S ON FIRST 


it, got his feet tangled up, and fell 
headlong. Smith Hashed over with 
unbelievable speed, gloved the ball, 
and threw to first — too late. Ander- 
son settled down, then, and struck 
out the next two batters. 

In the Pirates’ half of the first, 
Zilo collected one of his lucky hits, 
and Smith followed him with a lazy 
fly ball that cleared the fence. The 
Pirates led, two to nothing. 

Jones followed, and the first pitch 
was a called strike. Jones whirled 
on the umpire, towering over him, 
his big face livid with rage. His 
voice carried to the dugout over the 
noise of the crowd. 

“You wouldn’t fcnow a strike zone 
if I measured it out for you!” 

Pops started for home plate, and 
Jones saw him coming and meekly 
took his place in the batter’s box. 
Pops called time, and went over to 
talks to Dipsey Marlow. 

“Darned if I don’t think he’s still 
tight. Think I should lift him?” 
“Let him bat,” Marlow said. 
“Maybe he’ll connect.” 

The pitcher wasted one, and fol- 
lowed it with a curve that cut the 
outside comer. “Strike two!” the 
umpire called. 

Jones’ outraged bellow rattled 
the center field fence. “What?” he 
shrieked. He moved back around 
the catcher. 

The umpire gestured patiently to 
show where the ball had crossed 
the plate. Pops started out of the 
dugout again. The umpire said 
brusquely, “Play ball.” 

The pitcher wound up again, 
and as the ball sped platewards 
Jones suddenly leaped into the air 
— and stayed there. He hovered six 

65 



feet off the ground, and the ball 
crossed the plate far below his dan- 
gling feet. It was missed completely 
by the startled catcher and bounded 
back to the screen. 

The umpire did not call the pitch. 
He took two steps forward, and 
stood looking up at Jones. The 
crowd came to its feet, and players 
from both teams edged out of their 
dugouts. A sudden, paralyzed hush 
gripped the field. The voices from 
around home plate carried far. 

“Come down here,” the umpire 
called. 

“What’d you call that pitch? 
Strike, I suppose. Over the plate 
between my knees and armpits, 
wasn’t it?” 

“Come down here.” 

“You can’t make me.” 

“Come down here.” 

“You show me where it says in 
the rules that I have to bat with 
both feet on the ground.” 

The umpire moved down the 
third base line, and summoned his 
colleagues in for a conference. Pops 
walked out to home plate, and Zilo 
followed him. 

“Jones,” Zilo said pleadingly. 
“Go to hell,” Jones said. “I know 
I’m right. I’m still in the batter’s 
box.” 

“Please,” Zilo said. “You’ll spoil 
everything. You’ve already spoiled 
everything.” 

“So what? It’s about time we 
showed them how this game should 
be played.” 

“I’m taking you out, Jones,” 
Pops said. “I’m running in a pinch 
hitter. Get back to the dugout.” 
Jones shot up another four feet. 
“You can’t make me.” 

66 


The umpire returned. “I’m put- 
ting you out of the game,” he said. 
“Leave the field immediately.” 
“I’ve already left the field.” 
Pops, Zilo and the umpire stood 
glaring up as Jones glared down. 
At that critical moment Smith took 
charge. He walked slowly out to 
home plate, soared over the heads 
of those on the ground, and gave 
Jones a healthy clout on the jaw. 
Jones descended heavily, and Smith 
calmly landed nearby, and dried his 
hands on his trousers. 

Effective as his performance was, 
nobody noticed it. All eyes were on 
the sky, where a glistening tower of 
metal was dropping slowly down to- 
wards the outfield. It settled easily 
on the outfield grass, while the out- 
fielders fled in panic. 

The crowd murmured excitedly, 
and just as suddenly lapsed into si- 
lence again. A port opened in the 
side of the towering, needle-like 
object, and a landing ramp came 
down. The solitary figure that 
emerged did not use the ramp. He 
stepped off into mid-air, and drifted 
slowly towards the crowd at home 
plate. There he landed, a tremen- 
dous figure, square like Zilo and his 
friends, but a startling seven plus 
feet tall, trimly uniformed in a lus- 
trous brown, with ribbons and me- 
tallic braid in abundance. 

Zilo, Jones and Smith stood with 
their eyes downcast while the others 
stared. Anderson and White moved 
out of the Pirates’ dugout and 
walked forward haltingly. The 
stranger spoke one crisp sentence, 
which nobody understood — nobody, 
that is, except Zilo, Jones, Smith, 
Anderson and White. 

LLOYD BIGGLE, JR. 



Smith and Jones lifted slowly, 
and floated out to the ship, where 
they disappeared through the port. 
Anderson and White turned, and 
trudged wearily across the infield, 
across the outfield, and mounted 
the ramp. Only Zilo lingered. 

A few policemen moved nervous- 
ly out of the stands, and surrounded 
the ship. The hush continued as the 
tourists stared and half of Earth’s 
population watched on TV. 

Pops looked at the ship, at the 
oversized stranger, at Zilo. Tears 
streaked Zilo’s face. 

“I’m sorry, Pops. I hoped we 
could finish it off for you. I really 
wanted to win this World Series. 
But I 5 m afraid we’ll have to go.” 

Pops responded absently. “Go 
where?” 

“Where I came from. It’s an- 
other world.” 

“I see. Then — that’s how come 
you guys played so well.” 

Zilo wiped his eyes, and blub- 
bered miserably. His big, good- 
natured face was in the throes of 
torment. “The others did,” he 
sobbed. “I’m only a class F tele- 
kinetic myself, and that isn’t much 
where I come from. I guess you’d 
call me a moron. I did the best I 


could, but it was a terrible strain 


keeping the balls I hit away from 
the fielders, and stopping balls from 
going over the fence, and holding 
balls up until I could catch them. 
When I hurt my ankle I tried to 


help out from the bench, and it 
*3yrked for awhile. Sometimes I 
jijjuld even control the ball enough 
8^1 spoil a pitcher’s control, but usu- 
ally when the ball was thrown fast 


or hit fast I couldn’t do anything 


WHO'S ON FIRST 


with it, unless I was in the outfield 
and it had a long way to go. So I 
went back where I could get my 
ankle fixed, and I got the others. 
They’re really good — all of them 
Glass A. Anderson and White — 
those are just names I had them 
use — they could control the ball so 
well they could make it look like 
they were pitching. And no matter 
how hard the ball was hit they could 
control it, even when they were sit- 
ting on the bench.” 

Pops scratched his head, and 
said dazedly, “Make it look like 
they were pitching?” 

“They just pretended to throw, 
and then they controlled the ball — 
well, mentally. Any good telekinetic 
could do it. They could have done 
it just as well sitting on the bench, 
or they could help out when one of 
our other pitchers was pitching. 
And Smith and Jones are levitators. 
They could cover the ground real 
fast, and go up as high as they 
wanted to. I had a terrible time 
keeping them from going too high 
and spoiling everything. When we 
hit the ball Anderson and White 
could make it go anywhere they 
wanted, and they could control balls 
the other team hit, and nothing 
could get past Smith and Jones un- 
less we wanted it to. We won the 
pennant, and I hoped we would 
win this World Series, but they had 
to go and drink some of that alco- 
hol, and I guess Jones would have 
spoiled it even if we hadn’t been 
caught.” 

The stranger spoke another crisp 
sentence, and Zilo wiped the tears 
from his face and took Pops’ hand. 
“Good by, Pops,” he said. “It was 


67 



lots of fun. I really like baseball.’ 5 
He walked slowly out to the ship, 
passed the police without a glance, 
and climbed the ramp. 

Reporters were crowding out onto 
the field, and the stranger waved 
them back and spoke in English in 
a booming voice. “You shall have a 
complete explanation at the proper 
time. It is now my most unpleasant 
duty to call upon the man you call 
your president, to deliver the apolo- 
gies of my government. Muke Zilo 
says he did the best he could. He 
did entirely too much.” 

He floated back to the ship. The 
ramp lifted, and the police scat- 
tered as the ship plummeted 
upwards. The umpire-in-chief 
shrugged his shoulders and gestured 
with his mask. 

“Play ball!” 

Pops beckoned to a pinch hitter, 
got a pitcher warming up to replace 
Anderson, and walked back to the 
dugout. “They been calling me a 
genius,” he muttered to himself. 
“Manager of the year, they been 
calling me. And how could I lose?” 
A sports writer leaned down out 
of the stands. “How about a state- 
ment, Pops?” 

Pops spoke firmly. “You can say 
that the best decision I made this 
year was to retire.” 

An official statement was handed 
out in Washington before the game 
was over. That the Senators won 
the game, twenty-three to two, was 
irrelevant. No one cared, not even 
the ballplayers.

A full report on the activity of 
these escapees has no doubt reached 
your desk. The consequences of 
their offence are so serious they 
have not yet been fully evaluated. 
Not only have they forced us into 
premature contact with a Type 
17 D civilization for which neither 
of us is prepared, but our best 
estimate is that they have destroyed 
a notable cultural institution of that 
civilization. They are juveniles, 
their only motive seems to be that 
they were enjoying themselves. 
Nevertheless they are old enough 
to know better. I favor a maximum 
penalty . 

B ASEBALL, as students of the 
game had frequently remarked 
down through the years, was essen- 
tially a game of records and statis- 
tics. The records were there for all 
to see — incredible records, with 
Jones and Smith tied with a hun- 
dred and forty- two home runs and 
batting in the vicinity of .600, with 
Anderson and White each hurling 
two dozen no-hit games, and with 
the strike outs, and the extra-base 
hits, and the double plays, and the 
games won, and the total bases, and 
the runs batted in, and the runs 
scored, and the multitudinous in- 
dividual and team records that the 
Pirates had marked up during the 
season, the record book was perma- 
nently maimed. 

It was not the beginning of the 
end. It was the end. 


68 



Who had done all this? Four 
kids, four rather naughty kids, who, 
according to the strange man from 
outer space, were not especially 
bright. Four kids from another 
world, who had entered into a game 
requiring the ultimate in skill and 
intelligence and training and prac- 
tice, entered into it without ever 
playing it before, and made the best 
players Earth could offer look like 
a bunch of inept Little Leaguers. 

The records could be thrown out, 
but they could not be forgotten. 
And it could not be forgotten that 
the four kids had made those rec- 
ords when they weren’t half trying 
— because they didn’t want to make 
Earth’s ballplayers look too bad. 

Supposing — just supposing — the 
people from outer space were to 
send a team made up of intelligent 
adults? No one cared to contem- 


plate that possibility. 

So it was the end. The Senators 
took the World Series in seven 
straight games, and nobody cared. 
The stands were empty, and so few 
people paid to see the games on TV 
that the series ended up a financial 
catastrophe. A committee met to 
decide what to do about the aliens’ 
records, and reached no decision. 
Again, nobody cared. The various 
awards for the most valuable play- 
ers and managers of the year and 
the various individual champion- 
ships were never made. The over- 
sight was not protested. People had 
other things on their minds. 

And when a dozen TV comedy 
teams simultaneously resurrected an 
ancient, half-legendary, half-forgot- 
ten comedy sketch, they got no 
laughs whatsoever. The sketch was 
called, “Who’s on First?” END 


SPECIMEN 


( Continued from page 45 ) 

Humans proved a race whose phys- 
ical and mental strength equaled 
or surpassed our own, prudence 
would indicate that we seek peace. 
If we found them weak, we would 
exterminate them, and take over 
their world. The dominant factor 
in our decision was to be our study 
of the specimen we brought back, 
and how he conducted himself in 
t^ Big Run. We have all seen the 
ifegfa of that experiment.” 
j&ttes looked about the room, 
we all agreed that the only 
wise course — in view of our obser- 
vations — is to do everything in our 
power to establish peaceful rela- 


tions with the Earthmen?” 

There was no dissenting vote. 

“When our envoys leave for 
Earth an honored place will be 
made for our visitor,” Srtes added. 

The meeting was over, and the 
fateful decision had been made. 
For the next great tide much of my 
work would consist in reporting the 
tearing down of the Big Run. 

The alien had believed it to be 
one of our cities. It was a great deal 
of work, constructing the Big Run 
to test one alien specimen, but the 
results had proven the effort war- 
ranted. Now it could be disposed of. 

Perhaps this very day we would 
begin demanding the giant testing 
maze. END

C OMMANDER Losure gave orders to his navigator 
to bring the ship in on the satellite out of sight of 
the prying telescopes which no doubt existed on such an 
invitingly green planet. He was a cautious man and 
didn’t intend to lose any more crew members if he could 
help it. He could tell by the unusually poor handling 
of the ship that the crew was still demoralized from the 
brush with the high I.Q. slugs on that last planet which 
they had approached so directly. They’d lost three men 
in that scrap, one of them a highly-valued anthropol- 
ogist. There were only two more of those left in the 
freeze locker. Too bad it couldn’t have been a radio 
operator, there were plenty of those on ice. 


The computer classified it “rabbit” and Montresig was 
not one to argue , long ears or not! 


Rabbits Have LO'NG Ears 

/ 

BY LAWRENCE F. WILLARD 


The Commander’s thoughts were interrupted by his 
second officer who entered without the customary mil- 
itary burp. 

“I’ll forgive you this time, Montresig,” said the Com- 
mander, '‘but we can’t relax regulations now, can we. 
Anything new to report on this planet?” 

“No, Your Loftiness,” said Montresig, after giving a 
belated burp, “there’s nothing to add to what we al- 
ready know, but then we’ve just come to rest on this 
clinker of a moon. I don’t imagine, however, that we’ve 
located our long lost ancestors or our mythical home 
planet. There doesn’t seem to be a race in this galaxy 
that walks upright on two good legs with two arms, two 


70 



eyes, nose, mouth and other stan- 
dard equipment.” 

“Could be we’ll find one this 
time,” said the Commander. “We 
know it’s an oxygen planet, and 
that there are intelligent beings 
there, judging from the cities we 
can see and their use of radio.” 
‘Maybe,” grumbled Montresig, 
“but they won’t be men. If they’re 
not slugs they’ll be talking fish or 
intellectual spiders, or something 
equally repulsive. And I can tell 
you one thing, whatever we find, if 
it has brains it will want to fight.” 
“Now Montresig, don’t be bitter. 
We’ve only examined a couple hun- 
dred planets. There are many more 
and you know we’ll have to take a 
look at as many as we can. I tell 
you, however, we won’t take any 
more chances. Unless we find out 
they’re pretty much like us we 
won’t go near the damn planet.” 
“How do you propose to find that 
out, Your Loftiness? We can’t see 
anything that small by telescope, 
we haven’t learned much so far by 
listening to them, and it’s pretty 
dangerous business using the 
dredge . .” 

“Ah, my dear Montresig, the 
crux of the matter is that we can 
tell about them, I believe, from 
listening to them. Judging from 
the reports I got from Communi- 
crAipns, this is the talkingest planet 
i&Oe galaxy. They are utilizing the 
eira^ e radio spectrum we know and, 
I suspect, some portions of it we 
don’t know. All they do is talk. 
There must be millions of individ- 
uals on that planet jabbering in a 
dozen different languages. Our 
language technicians have decoded 


two of the major tongues already 
and have fed the information to 
the main computer. All radio sig- 
nals in those languages are now be- 
ing fed directly to the computer and 
the information is being classified 
and cross-referenced.” 

Montresig’s furry countenance 
brightened. “Then we won’t have 
to send down the dredge?” 

“I hope not, Montresig, I do not 
like to bring strange life forms 
aboard the ship. Remember planet 
187 in the Dghorzid system?” 
Montresig shuddered. “I’ll never 
forget. When that monster material- 
ized in the hold I snapped on the 
stasis field and it had no effect. I 
tried every last trick in the bag in- 
cluding seven kinds of poison gas. 
Luckily the dredge operator was 
able to catch him and throw him 
back where he came from but the 
hold was a shambles and two men 
had to have extensive repair work.” 
“Well,” said the Commander, “I 
don’t like the dredge at all, but I 
suppose it’s better than landing and 
having to do battle with slugs. I 
swear I was certain there was no 
intelligent life on that planet. By 
the way, I’m having an anthropol- 
ogist thawed out now, that leaves 
only one more in the freeze locker 
and we can’t operate without one. 
Take care nothing happens to him, 
Montresig.” 

Commander Losure made the 
sign of dismissal and Montresig 
burped gracefully and withdrew. 
The Commander signaled com- 
munications. After a considerable 
delay a burp sounded from the 
speaker on the wall and a voice an- 
nounced: “Troniff here. May I 


71 



serve Your Loftiness ?” 

“Troniff,” said the Commander, 
“the delay is inexcusable. Does 
the computer have its belly full 
yet?” 

“Your Loftiness, the reference 
tapes are full, but the machine is 
unable to present a full picture of 
the dominant life form. It appears, 
however, that they are much like 
us in general body shape. Unfor- 
tunately, we can get no reference 
point from which to judge their 
size. They are exceedingly ferocious 
and blood thirsty, and apparently 
war among themselves continu- 
ously.” 

“I’m tempted to leave now,” said 
the Commander. “I’ll have to use 
the dredge, I suppose . Are you 
sure it won’t do some good to listen 
to their communications awhile 
longer?” 

The speaker was silent for a mo- 
ment, then Troniff spoke.' 

“I don’t like to mention this, 
Your Loftiness, but my engineers 
have found several unidentified 
types of emission besides those 
carrying speech frequencies. They 
think that one particular type char- 
acterized by an extremely broad 
frequency range just might be trans- 
mission of visual images . 

“I don’t believe it,” said the 
Commander. “We’ve been trying 
to do that for hundreds of years 
without success and so far as we’ve 
been we’ve never found another 
race in the galaxy as far advanced 
technologically as ours. These 
people don’t even have space 
flight.” 

“They have artificial satellites 
up,” said Troniff, “We’re monitor- 

72 


ing signals from one, and from 
what I gather they’re apt to have 
something up on this moon before 
long.” 

“Any chance of finding out how 
they transmit visual images — if they 
really do?” 

“Not a chance,” said Troniff. 
“My engineers can’t even conceive 
of a device that could convert these 
signals into a picture.” 

“That’s all, Troniff. Notify Mon- 
tresig that he’s to meet me immed- 
iately in the dredge room with the 
anthropologist and a dredge oper- 
ator.” 

The commander sighed. What 
irony that the only truly peaceful 
race in the galaxy should be the only 
one to discover interstellar flight. 
For four thousand years the Kaar 
had had their ships and had colon- 
ized hundreds of planets until they 
had lost track of which one they 
started from. In all that time they 
had avoided planets with intelligent 
life, had never found any other ships 
in space. Now, thought the Com- 
mander, we have to go looking for 
trouble just to satisfy our curiosity 
as to where we started from. 

Montresig introduced the newly- 
thawed anthropologist to him on 
the dredge room balcony and Com- 
mander Losure briefed him on the 
importance of his job. 

“We don’t believe this race has 
any connection with ours,” said the 
Commander. “It’s too savage. And 
yet, we haven’t found another race 
as far advanced in science, nor one 
that appears to be so similar to ours. 
Our problem is to find out a little 
more about them, their physical 
size, whether it’s safe to contact 

LAWRENCE F. WILLARD 



them, which I personally doubt.” 

“Is it your intention to bring 
back one of these intelligent beings 
with the dredge?” asked the anthro- 
pologist. 

“You know better than that, or 
maybe you don’t.” said the Com- 
mander. “Anyway, you should know 
that it is against our code of ethics 
to cause harm to any intelligent be- 
ing. That dredge is set to reject any 
living creature capable of a high 
order of thought and that control is 
sealed against our use. The idea is to 
bring back artifacts that might tell 
us something about the people of 
the planet . maybe they have a 
written language and have some- 
thing that approximates our scrolls, 
maybe they have drawings. I’d 
especially like to snag one of the 
visual image receptors our com- 
munications engineers think they 
have.” 

“The dredge operator is ready,” 
said Montresig. “The computer 
controls have been switched to this 
balcony and the stasis beam has 
been checked.” 

C OMMANDER Losure looked 
up at the dredge operator in his 
glassed-in booth high on the op- 
posite wall of the hold. He gave a 
quick hand signal and transferred 

f ; attention to the floor of the vast 
Id below him. A shimmering 
stiness began to form in the cen- 
• of the floor. Commander Losure 
could feel the tension of his com- 
panions as they waited. It was a 
blind grab ; the dredge operator had 
no way of knowing what would be 
scooped up at the end of his force 

RABBITS HAVE LONG EARS 


beam. Slowly the mistiness grew 
more dense, darkening to an impen- 
etrable cloud, and then vanished 
with an audible snap leaving a 
strange alien mechanism on the 
floor of the hold. It resembled a 
huge cylinder resting on tractor-like 
treads. 

From the balcony the men scurry- 
ing across the floor seemed dwarfed 
by the object. Unheeding of any 
danger they swanned over it, meas- 
uring, testing, amassing information 
to be fed to the computer. 

“Holy Ghosts of My Departed 
Ancestors,” gasped Montresig, 
“what is it?” 

“You know as much about it as 
I do, my dear fellow,” the Com- 
mander said. “As soon as the engi- 
neers get through poking at it we’ll 
find out what the computer thinks 
it is.” 

“I’ll bet it’s a weapon of some 
sort,” said Montresig. “They’re al- 
most always fighting down there ac- 
cording to the data we have and 
there’s frequent mention of a device 
called a hydrogen bomb. If it’s what 
I think it is I have no desire to visit 
them in person.” 

A figure detached itself from the 
group of men surrounding the hugh 
contrivance and came hurrying to 
the elevator entrance beneath the 
balcony. In a moment he appeared 
on the balcony, burped perfunc- 
torily, and handed Commander 
Losure several sheets of script. The 
Commander read them into a mic- 
rophone grill which was part of the 
remote panel feeding into the main 
computer. He waited until a red 
light glowed, indicating that the 
material had been integrated. He 

73 



pressed a stud and spoke into the 
microphone again. “Classify,” he 
said. 

“Information in storage banks re- 
veals object to be a gun,” said the 
loudspeaker. “Gun: an instrument 
variously known as revolver, heater, 
rod, betsy, automatic, typewriter, 
gat, which refer to. Carried by gun- 
men, cowboys, mobsters, killers,

Sample excerpt demonstrating use: 
‘Blinky snapped the gun from his 
holster and fired from the hip. 
(sound of explosion) The big cow- 
poke grabbed at his chest and blood 
spurted between his fingers. With a 
look of surprise on his face he 
slumped to the barroom floor.’ ” 

“What do you make of that?” 
asked the Commander. 

“I’d have been suprised, too,” 
said Montresig. 

“They’re bloodthirsty giants,” 
said the anthropologist. “If that’s a 
pocket weapon they’d be so big you 
couldn’t get one into this hold. 

“I don’t believe it,” said the Com- 
mander. “I think there’s something 
wrong somewhere. Possibly guns 
come in various sizes. This could be 
a stationary weapon, perhaps, to 
blow buildings apart instead of 
people, though I can’t figure out 

74 


why anybody would want to. I’m 
going to send the dredge back once 
more to make sure we aren’t being 
misled.” 

“I think you’re wrong,” said 
Montresig. “All evidence does point 
to a race of giants, evil creatures at 
best, even if maybe they do have 
two eyes, a nose and a mouth like 
us. Not that I don’t think it’s a good 
idea to send the dredge back,” he 
added hastily at the sight of Com- 
mander Losure’s glowering count- 
enance. 

The Commander signaled to the 
dredge operator again and they 
waited while he returned the gun to 
wherever he got it and fished for 
something else from the surface of 
the green planet. 

The anthropologist cleared his 
throat. “You can’t deny that the 
telescope shows us the most gigantic 
cities to be found anywhere in the 
galaxy.” 

“That doesn’t necessarily mean 
that the inhabitants are physically 
large, only that there may be a lot 
of them,” said the Commander. 

“Or both.” 

Their attention turned to the 
floor of the hold as the opaque 
cloud rapidly grew darker and van- 
ished again with a snap. 

Montresig’s reaction was the 
same as before. 

“Great Shades of My Holy An- 
cestors,” he said. “What is it?” 

“It is assuredly an animal,” said 
the Commander, “not unlike some 
we have on our own planet. I’ll 
have the biologists and medics ex- 
amine it.” He turned to the anthro- 
pologist. “You go, too, Alfvis.” 

The animal, which had appeared 

LAWRENCE F. WILLARD 



stunned when it first appeared, now 
began to turn around, making click- 
ing noises on the floor. As the men 
approached it from all directions it 
looked about nervously, opened its 
mouth to show some glistening teeth 
and proceeded to make a long, 
harsh noise. Alfvis made the mistake 
of approaching too closely to the 
beast which wheeled and kicked 
him head over heels some distance 
away. Montresig touched a red 
button on the railing and stasis 
beams converged on the animal 
freezing it instantly. It toppled over 
and lay stiffly on the floor of the 
hold. Alfvis dragged himself to his 
feet and shouted up to the balcony. 

“Ask the computer about animals 
with long ears.” 

The Commander spoke into the 
microphone again. “Four-legged 
animal, long ears. Classify.” 

“Rabbit,” said the computer. “An 
animal variously known as bunny, 
hare, coney, peter, uncle wiggly. 
Strong rear legs. Progresses over 
ground erratically. Consumes vege- 
tation. Multiplies with great rapid- 
ity. Lays egg at Easter Time. It is 
generally considered timid and is 
hunted for food. Sample excerpt 
demonstrating relationship : ‘Lon 

climbed over the stone wall and 
continued across the woodlot to* 
wards his cabin, the carcasses of 
rytfiree rabbits slung over his shoul- 

S r . there would be rabbit stew 
night.’ ” 

“Holy Gods in Their Celestial 
Quarters,” said Montresig. “Did 
you hear that? Is there any ques- 
tion in your mind now about the 
size and ferocity of these people?” 
“Considerable,” said the Com- 

RABBITS HAVE LONG EARS 


mander. “That computer has made 
mistakes before, witness that last 
planet. Those were supposed to be 
garden snails, those slugs that gave 
us such a walloping. I don’t think 
we get the right information 
through to it.” 

“But Your Loftiness,” wailed 
Montresig, “everything adds up, you 
can see for yourself . their giant 
cities, their warring on each other, 
the information the computer gave 
us ... it isn’t safe to land on that 
planet.” 

“No, I suppose not,” sighed the 
Commander. “But do you realize 
the implications? Here we have a 
highly advanced race just ready to 
take off into space . and accord- 
ing to our information they are sav- 
age war-making giants. If I bring 
that news back our Supreme Good- 
ness is apt to issue orders to evacu- 
ate several hundred planets and 
move to some other galaxy — Let’s 
try the dredge once more.” 

Commander signaled the dredge 
operator and waited a reasonable 
length of time before he was in- 
formed that something was wrong 
with it and that it would be some 
time before repairs could be made. 

“I give up,” said Commander 
Losure. “I have orders not to land 
on a questionable planet and I’ve 
learned my lesson. Either that com- 
puter has a few loose connections or 
those people are broadcasting pure 
nonsense. I just don’t believe in 
giants, much less in scientific ones. 
Get ready to leave, Montresig, and 
see that you make an accurate 
written report of this whole situ- 
ation.” 

“What do we do with the animal, 


75 



Your Loftiness?” 

“The dredge is busted, so what 
do you think we can do with it? 
Heave it out the airlock. It can stay 
here on the moon until the first ex- 
plorers come up from the planet, 
which won’t be long, and they can 
have rabbit stew.” 

The great ship lifted from the 
dark moonscape, leaving behind the 
frozen form of the first earth beinsr 
to have crossed space, a surprise for 
the crew of the first manned moon 
rocket, if not the makings of rabbit 
stew. 

Somewhere, a million miles be- 
yond the sun, the ship accelerated 
rapidly. The Commander looked up 
from his desk as Montresig entered 
smartly with a precision burp. 

“Alfvis is back in the freeze locker 
and repairs are going forward on 
the dredge, but it’ll be a long job.” 
“It doesn’t matter,” said the 
Commander. “We’re going home. 
I’m committed to bringing back a 


report on this planet now, but I 
don’t like it and will advise further 
study of it by other expeditions be- 
fore any desperate measures are 
taken such as evacuating the 
galaxy.” 

“It’s funny about that rabbit,” 
said Montresig. “I noticed as we 
shoved it out the lock that it had 
semi-circles of some hard metal, 
probably iron, nailed to its feet.” 
“That is peculiar,” said the Com- 
mander. “Almost like the shoes we 
attach to the feests’ hooves before 
the children ride them. Just for the 
fun of it, Montresig, why don’t you 
give that information to the com- 
puter and see what it says?” 

“Can’t,” said Montresig. “I 
wiped the memory tanks clean. I 
don’t think it means much, anyway; 
a rabbit’s a rabbit, shoes or no 
shoes.” 

The Commander nodded and 
Montresig burped and withdrew.

Illustrated by Ed Emsh 


The Short Snorter 


His saucer was parked in 
woods, and Mr. Steanot 


( from Venus ) was parked in 
the lobby ... 


T HREE paths led through the 
woods away from the resort 
hotel, and of the three two were 
clearly marked: one with a sign 
that said it led to the lake, the other 
pointing toward the golf links. The 
third pathway was unmarked, and 
this was the one that inevitably the 
lovers and the honeymooners took 
— the path that Alice and Fred 


BY CHARLES EINSTEIN 



Daniels followed today. 

The sun was unusually warm for 
this time of year, but only a few 
yards along the pathway Fred and 
Alice were swallowed up by the 
great and near-great trees of the 
forest. The sunlight was, except for 
an occasional patch of light here 
and there, warded away by the 
foliage above. The forest was very 
quiet. The pathway bridged a silent 
brook, and then, perhaps a third of 
a mile into the woods, turned 
abruptly to the left and the woods 
became even more dense, the path- 
way narrow. 

Through the trees to the right at 
this point was a clearing, an un- 
usual grassy circle perhaps sixty 
yards in diameter. It was not the 
clearing itself, however, but, in- 
stead, the glint of color in the sun- 
light that caused Fred and Alice to 
stop and look. 

Alice said, “Fred, what is that?” 

“Don’t know,” he said. “Some- 
thing red. Let’s look.” 

The two of them turned off the 
path and made their way through 
a dismal barrage of thicket to the 
clearing that lay beyond. When 
they got there, they saw the circular 
object — vehicle might be a better 
word. It was possibly fifteen yards 
in diameter. It seemed to be made 
of three rings, smaller ones bottom 
and top and the larger one ribbing 
the center, and to be constructed of 
some kind of plastic. Between the 
central and upper rings were set a 
series of small windows. The entire 
thing was painted a gaudy red. 

“What do you think it is?” Fred 
said. 

“A flying saucer,” Alice said 
78 


promptly. She laughed a little, but 
clutched at her husband’s arm. 
“Isn’t it?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“But what else would it be?” 

“I don’t know,” Fred said again. 
“Let’s look inside.” 

“Fred,” Alice said, “You’d better 
not—” 

“Don’t be silly,” he said, and 
walked resolutely up to the object 
and, standing on tiptoe, peered 
through one of the windows. 

“What is it?” Alice called from 
the edge of the clearing. “What do 
you see?” 

“It’s empty,” he called back. 
“What’s inside?” 

Fred shook his head. “You won’t 
believe it.” 

“What?” 

“It’s got a steering wheel,” he 
called out hollowly. “And some 
dials.” 

“My goodness,” Alice said. “Is it 
a real one?” 

“How do I know?” he said, and 
rejoined her, casting a series of 
glances uncertainly over his shoul- 
der at the bright red saucer behind 
him. “What do you suppose we 
ought to do?” 

“Tell somebody,” Alice said. “I 
suppose.” 

“Who do we tell?” 

“I don’t know. There must be 
somebody — ” 

They looked almost guiltily at 
each other. “Nobody’ll believe us,” 
Fred said. 

“Why not?” Alice said. “It’s 
here , isn’t it?” 

Fred stopped and thought. “Who 
knows how long it’ll stay?” 

They looked at each other again. 

CHARLES EINSTEIN 



Then Alice said slowly, “If we 
went back and got the camera — ” 

Swiftly, they made their way 
back toward the hotel through the 
quiet forest. When they got there, 
they found Mr. Mason, the man- 
ager of the hotel, adjusting the 
badminton net in front of the main 
porch. Mr. Mason loosed a ready 
smile. “How’s everything?” he said. 
“Find enough to do?” 

“Yes, thank you,” Fred said to 
him. “We were just walking 
through the woods. We came back 
for our camera. Then we’re off 
again.” 

Mr. Mason nodded. “Find the 

saucer?” 

Fred looked at him. “You mean 
the flying saucer?” 

The manager nodded again. “I 
see you did find it. Good. Take a 
picture of it, by all means. I’ve al- 
ready taken a whole batch myself.” 
“You have?” Fred said, frown- 
ing. “What’s it all about?” 

“It’s a flying saucer,” Mr. Mason 
said. “From Venus. Mr. Steariot, 
who piloted it, is a guest here. I can 
introduce you to him if you like. He 
speaks excellent English.” 

Daniels said, “Wait a min- 

A — ” 

“ 0 ®, there’s no point in it,” Mr. 
Mason said in a weary tone of voice. 
“No point in it at all. I took pic- 
tures. I tried to get the Army up 
here. I wrote letters.” He shrugged 
expressively. “It’s a cynical age we 
live in, I guess. Everybody’s very 
polite, but they make it clear they 
think it’s just a gimmick I worked 
up to get the hotel publicity.” He 
nodded seriously. “The whole trou- 

THE SHORT SNORTER 


ble’s with Mr. Steariot. If he had a 
light bulb for a head, or seven 
legs, or talked funny, why, it’d be 
a different thing entirely. But he 
looks and acts just like you or I. 
Here I’ve got a legitimate flying 
saucer sitting on my property and 
you might as well try to tell them 
it’s a — well, a flying saucer! For 
all they’ll believe me. Now you two 
have seen it with your own eyes 
and you don’t believe it either.” 
Fred swallowed and looked at 
Alice for a moment. Then he said, 
“What did you say his name was?” 
“Mr. Steariot,” Mr. Mason said. 
“Actually, he’s just as happy no- 
body believes he’s from Venus. If 
they believed it, they’d probably 
lock him up in jail somewhere or 
impound his saucer. As it is, he 
says this is the first vacation he’s 
had in years.” Mr. Mason looked 
unhappily about him. “He’s prob- 
ably in the lounge now. Want to 
meet him?” 

Fred said dazedly, “I — ” 

“Ah, come on,” Mr. Mason said. 
“He won’t bite you.” He led the 
way up the steps of the porch and 
into the lounge and over to where 
a small, mustachioed man, wearing 
eyeglasses and appearing to be in 
his late forties, was working a cross- 
word puzzle in the morning paper. 

“Mr. Steariot,” Mr. Mason said, 
“I should like you to meet Mr. 
and Mrs. Daniels, also guests here. 
They have just seen your saucer.” 
“Charmed,” Mr. Steariot said, 
and got to his feet. He shook hands 
with Fred Daniels. “Are you here 
for a long stay, Mr. Daniels?” 
“I’m not sure,” Fred said, a little 
unhappily. “Mr. Mason told us you 

79 



were from Venus.” 

“I told them about you, Mr. 
Steariot,” Mr. Mason said. “Nat- 
urally, they don’t believe it any 
more than anybody else.” 

“No reason why they should,” 
Mr. Steariot said amiably. “No 
reason in the world, if I may coin 
a phrase. Dr. Phelps at the In- 
stitute didn’t believe it either.” 

Mr. Mason said, “Mr. Steariot 
here had a long interview with Dr. 
Phelps of the Geophysical Institute 
at Princeton when he first arrived 
here on Earth with us.” 

“Oh,” Fred said. He gazed un- 
comfortably at Mr. Steariot. “We 
didn’t mean to interrupt you.” 

“I was only doing the crossword 
puzzle,” Mr. Steariot said. “Do you 
know a two-letter word for sun- 
god?” 

Alice said, “Is this your first trip 
here?” 

“You mean here to the hotel,” 
Mr. Steariot said, “or to Earth?” 
“Earth,” Fred said, dismally. 
“My second,” Mr. Steariot said. 
“First trip I wound up near Lenin- 
grad. Terrible time. I thought 
they’d talk English, but they don’t, 
and they thought I was an Ameri- 
can, and two of their officials got 
into the saucer with me, and the 
only way I could save myself was 
to take off with them. They’re on 
Venus now.” 

“This accounts,” Mr. Mason 
broke in, “for the way those two 
high Russian officials suddenly dis- 
appeared from sight three years 
ago. You remember? Everybody 
thought they’d been liquidated.” 
Fred Daniels looked around 
the room. A hollow, frightening 

80 


feeling had come upon him. There 
were hundreds of questions he 
could have asked, and yet he 
wanted nothing so much as to be 
away from there. 

His wife Alice, though, was con- 
strained to learn more about Mr. 
Steariot. She said, “Mr. Steariot, 
may I ask you something?” 

“By all means,” Mr. Steariot 
said, and blinked owlishly at her. 

“Do you,” Alice said to him, 
“carry any money?” 

It was, Fred Daniels realized, a 
marvelous question. If there were 
sham here, this would be the 
quickest way to — 

“Why, of course,” Mr. Steariot 
said, and reached for his wallet. 
“Let’s see — health insurance — sau- 
cer driver’s license — here, my dear. 
A five-djino bill.” He extracted a 
yellow banknote and handed it to 
Alice. The banknote, slightly larger 
than an American dollar bill, was 
remarkably similar in other t^r- 
ticulars. It had upon it a pictJflfetaf 
a flying saucer, the figure 5, 
spelled out, “FIVE DJINOS”. 

“Let me sign it for you,” Mr. 
Steariot said, taking out a pen. 
“You can have it for a souvenier.” 
“Like the short snorters in the 
war,” Mr. Mason, the hotel mana- 
ger, said. “You remember them, 
Mr. Daniels? Where people got 
famous signatures on five and ten 
and twenty-dollar bills and ex- 
changed them and what not, and 
they called them short snorters?” 
“I remember,” Fred Daniels 
said. “Something like that.” 

“Five djinos on Venus,” Mr. 
Steariot said, signing his name with 
a flourish, “is worth about twenty 

CHARLES EINSTEIN 



dollars here on Earth. No official 
rate of exchange, of course, but 
from what I’ve seen, that’s about 
what I’d judge. Here you go.” He 
handed the bill over. 

“Well, wait, then,” Fred Daniels 
said. “I ought to sign one of our 
bills for you ” 

“Ah, no need for that,” Mr. 
Steariot said. “No doubt you need 
twenty dollars worse than I need 
five djinos.” 

“Don’t be ridiculous,” Fred said, 
a little stiffly; and, by now commit- 
ted, he went into his wallet and 
came out with a twenty dollar bill. 
He signed his name to it, using 
Mr. Steariot’s fountain pen. 

“Wonderful,” Mr. Steariot said. 
“How nice to have met you both.” 

“I feel very badly about this,” 
Mr. Mason, the hotel manager, said 
to Fred and Alice. The three of 
them were on the porch outside. 
“This short snorter business always 
seems to happen whenever I in- 
troduce Mr. Steariot to anyone. 
Dr. Phelps at the Institute gave 
him fifty dollars. Can you imagine 
that?” 

“It’s interesting in its way,” Fred 
said. “It just occurred to me: Mr. 
Steariot can spend Earth money 
here, but we can’t spend Venus 
money.” 

“That’s true,” Mr. Mason said. 
“On the other hand, Mr. Steariot 
has never once, to my knowledge, 
been the one to bring up the sub- 
ject. I think it’s quite painful to 
him, really. But the same thing in- 
evitably occurs to everybody he 
meets. You know, let’s see the color 
of your money. I guess people are 

THE SHORT SNORTER 


pretty much the same everywhere 
— that is, everywhere on Earth. 
They judge everything in terms of 
money, including whether you’ve 
even been bom on Earth! ‘Let’s 
see your money,’ they say to Mr. 
Steariot, and out he comes with one 
of those damn five-djino bills, and 
we’re off.” 

“You know,” Alice Daniels said 
thoughtfully, “in a way it’s a lesson. 
Isn’t it, Fred? I mean, everybody 
is money conscious. Maybe too 
much so. I’m not sorry it cost us 
twenty dollars to meet Mr. Stea- 
riot.” 

‘You may be right,” Fred said 
to her. “You may be right. Who 
knows, some day this five-djino bill 
may be a very valuable — ” 

“There you go again,” Alice cut 
in. “Always putting it in terms of 
money.” 

“But you're the one,” Fred said, 
“who thought to ask him about it 
in the first place.” 

“Don’t quarrel,” Mr. Mason, the 
hotel manager, said to them. “After 
all, for you it’s just a vacation. For 
me, I’ve got this man sitting in my 
lounge day in and day out doing 
crossword puzzles and trading short 
snorters with my guests. Nobody 
really believes he’s from Venus — 
nobody important, anyway. It’s a 
little frightening, when you’re try- 
ing to run a happy hotel. Some- 
times I wish he’d go back to where- 
ever he came from.” 

“Well,” Fred said, “he’s bound 
to leave one of these days.” 

“Maybe,” Mr. Mason said doubt- 
fully. “Offhand, though, I’d say 
the way he’s taking it in, he can’t 
afford to.” END

Pete never heard of that old 
adage about “What’s sauce 
for the goose is sauce for the 
gander” . 

The 

MARRYING 

MAN 


BY 

JOSEPH FARRELL 


I T WASN’T that Pete Cooper 
didn’t love his wives, or that he 
wanted to see them hurry on into 
the next world. He always felt real 
grief when he found himself a 
widower. 

But a man must be practical. 
They were all healthy young 
women, or at least middle aged 
when he married them, good insur- 
ance risks, and no insurance agent 
was turning down the business when 
Pete asked for a policy that big, 
especially when Pete was putting 
the cash on the line to pay up the 
policy when he bought it. 

That was the most sensible way 
for a man in the interstellar service 
to invest hif^^noney, Pete said. 
When he wafiSLft in space traveling 
at near light sfffild, and time slowed 
almost to a stop for him, the few 
months he spent on an expedition 
meant that nine years passed for a 
wife on Earth for a Centauri trip, 
and Sirius meant fifteen, and Altair 
twenty-five. So a man only saw his 
wife two or three times between 
trips, and maybe the last time he 
saw her he had to take her to the 
old ladies’ home, and the next time 
he pulled into Earth the insurance 
company was waiting for him with 
a check. Safer than stocks, and 
there was always the possibility that 
the loving wife might come to an ac- 
cidental end, which would sadden 
him, but it meant a double indem- 
nity payment. That sort of satisfied 
a man’s natural desire to have a 
little speculation attached to his in- 
vestment. 

Sally was the seventh. Pete sat 
fingering the check, feeling genuine 
sadness at his bereavement. 


82 



“Lovely girl , 55 he told the insur- 
ance agent. “It makes a man feel 
empty to come home from the stars 
and find that his wife has gone to 
her reward.” 

The insurance man disguised a 
cynical smirk behind his sympa- 
thetic mask. “Yes ... a wonderful 
woman. But it must happen to all 
of us.” 

He patted Pete’s shoulder gently. 
Pete rose, folded the check care- 
lessly and put it into a pocket. He 
shook the insurance agent’s hand. 

“You’ve been very kind. I’ll take 
your card ... in case I ever need 
another policy . .” 

Pete expected to need another 
policy before he left for his next 
trip. He felt unhappy about Sally’s 
being gone, but a man mustn’t give 
in to morbid self pity. And hadn’t 
he heard somebody say that a man 
without a wife was like a spaceship 
without a motor? 

He strolled about the city, unim- 
pressed by the changes since his last 
visit. An interstellar man with as 
much service as Pete was beyond 
showing surprise at superficial dif- 
ferences. He was a little annoyed to 
find that the moving sidewalks were 
old-fashioned and had been tom 
out. People now wore little repulsor 
units on their belts. 

Walking was tiresome. He 
stopped at a corner and watched 
the pedestrians as they whizzed by 
a few inches off the ground. At least 
they were clothed ; the nudity of the 
previous century had been some- 
what unnerving even to the blase 
eyes of a time man. And he was 
glad to see that the women were 


back to wearing long, well groomed 
hair. That period when fashion had 
called for smoothly shaven heads 
hadn’t suited his taste at all. 

In fact, none of it seemed to 
appeal to him very much any more. 
That was sophistication, the price 
that must be paid by a man in the 
interstellar service, watching the 
centuries go by without belonging 
to any one of them. He watched a 
group of young people flit laughing 
by, felt an unreasoning irritation. 
They’d be gone and forgotten when 
he’d made a few more trips. 

One of the young girls noticed 
him. She broke from the group 
and approached. 

“You’re an interstellar, aren’t 
you? I hope you’ll join me. I’m 
Nancy . .” 

Pete straightened up and looked 
her over. A little young, maybe 
nineteen, but that meant a lower 
premium. Nice blond hair, big 
waves of it that stayed in place even 
when she was moving fast, and even 
when she was standing still she 
seemed to moving. She was really 
alive, smiling and laughing and 
talking easily, and in a pleasant low 
voice. Really healthy — that slender 
but nicely rounded body was good 
for a hundred years. 

But then, money isn’t everything. 

“A lovely name,” he told her. “I 
like girls with old-fashioned names 
• • • 

Nancy, it seemed, wanted to inter- 
view a time man in connection 
with a thesis, and in this particular 
age there was no taboo against a 
young girl introducing herself to a 
strange man. Pete didn’t mind at 
all being interviewed and having 


83 



dinner with her and seeing the town 
with her. And even when he had 
given her enough material for a 
dozen theses, she didn’t seem in any 
hurry to break off their friendship. 

P ETE WAS spending half his 
waking hours with Nancy and 
the other half in the men’s beauty 
parlor. Not that he was old — a little 
prematurely gray and somewhat 
wrinkled from the hard sun of space 
and the unkind atmospheres of alien 
planets. And he had his contact 
lenses changed — paper was scarce in 
this era and they were using finer 
print to stretch the supply. But he 
was still young. He studied the full 
length mirror and decided he’d 
pass for thirty-five. His actual age 
— that would be hard to guess. 
Someday he’d look into the com- 
pany records and figure it out. But 
mentally, he told himself, I’m a 
young man, even though I walked 
through this city five hundred years 
ago. 

A young man in love. 

They knew in this era how to 
make it nice for young people in 
love, if you could afford one of the 
better places. Pete sat across the 
table from Nancy at a tiny table on 
a roof far above the city. The room 
was crowded, but some trick of de- 
sign made it seem that they were 
alone together. There was real 
music played by real people. Some 
of the melodies were old ones that 
brought a mood of nostalgia to the 
time man, with memories of past 
loves. But then he looked across at 
Nancy, with her innocent laughing 
eyes, and the beauty of her brought 

84 


a lump to his throat that drove out 
all the small loves of the past. This 
was it. This time he was really in 
love. 

“Pete,” she said, “don’t you ever 
get tired of it? Of jumping through 
the ages, coming back to find your 
old friends gone, being a stranger 
in a strange world? For instance, 
how about me? You’ll be back from 
Sirius or Altair some day, a year or 
two older, and I’ll be an old 
woman? How does it really feel?” 

Pete took her hands and stared 
earnestly into her eyes. She was 
more serious than he’d ever seen 
her as she gazed back at him. 

“It’s not the right way to live, 
Nancy. A man doesn’t really live, 
in the real meaning of life. A man 
needs a woman, a wife he can come 
home to.” He squeezed her hands 
gently. “Nancy, will you marry 
me?” 

Her hands trembled in his grasp. 

“I will, Pete — oh, Pete, I’ve been 
so hoping — and so afraid. But, Pete, 
your job . .?” 

He smiled reassuringly. 

“I’m signed up for a trip, but it’s 
only a short one — that planet of 
Proxima Centauri they just discov- 
ered is on the list for a complete 
survey. But I’ll be back in — seven, 
eight years. Then we can really 
settle down.” 

She bent over the table and kissed 
him. 

“I’ll wait, Pete.” 

“No, Nancy. Now. We’ll be mar- 
ried first; I’ll still be here a couple 
of months, why waste them? I don’t 
want to take any chances of losing 
you.” 

“I wanted to hear that, Pete.” 


JOSEPH FARRELL 



Her eyes were shining with happi- 
ness. “About getting married now, 
I mean — there’s no chance of your 
losing me.” 

Pete was serious about settling 
down after the short trip to Prox- 
ima. At least he was serious about 
it now. But after that trip was 
over . 

He didn’t think about that sort of 
thing any more. He had tried to 
puzzle it out a few times, how he 
could tell a girl he was making one 
more trip, and mean it, and then 
one more and then one more until 
a happy young girl was suddenly a 
disillusioned embittered old woman. 
There was a paradox of conscience 
here that he had given up trying to 
resolve. When he said he was mak- 
ing one more trip, he meant it. But 
at the same time he knew that when 
he came back he’d sign up for an- 
other. If he meant what he said 
when he said it, even though he 
knew he’d change his mind later — 

His conscience was clear. 

And of course a man must be 
practical. His earnings must be in- 
vested, and the future provided for. 
The honeymoon was still new when 
the insurance agent responded to 
Pete’s call. 

“I’ve always believed in insur- 
ance,” he told Nancy. “Of course, 
no amount of money could console 
me if I came back and found that 
something had happened to you. 
But people must prepare for the un- 
pleasant things in life.” 

“Of course,” said Nancy, who 
never disagreed with her husband. 
“We have to be sensible about 
things. I might have an accident, 
and so might you. We have to face 

THE MARRYING MAN 


things like that.” 

The insurance man was a little 
dazed. He’d never sold a policy 
nearly as big as the amount Pete 
had named. 

“Nobody’s had an accident on an 
interstellar ship in hundreds of 
years,” he assured Nancy. “The rate 
for your husband will be negligible 
— we expect him to be around for 
a real long time. Now, sir,” he told 
Pete, “your best buy is our family 
special — the full value to be paid to 
the survivor. As I said, the cost for 
you is trivial, and for your wife . .” 

He thumbed his rate book nerv- 
ously. Pete wrote a check to pay 
the policy in full, and the insurance 
man walked out in a trance, spend- 
ing his commission. 

And Nancy hadn’t noticed that 
Pete’s signature had gone on a 
guarantee that he wouldn’t resign 
from the interstellar service for at 
least two hundred years, objective 
Earth time. 


ETE FELT a little sad when his 
leave began to run out. They 
sat around evenings adoring each 
other, not too late, because Pete 
was a man who needed plenty of 
sleep or he felt irritable the next 
day. Nancy never took his bad days 
seriously. The laughing happiness of 
youth was still in her eyes, but there 
was a firmness behind it now, the 
maturity of a girl who knows how 
to become a woman. 

He went down to the spaceport 
a few times to look over the ship 
he was signed up for, and took the 
routine physical. Doctors went over 
his mind and his body, probing with 

85 




needles and tubes and questions 
that were pointless. 

“What do you think of the pop- 
ular songs of today, Mr. Cooper?” 
“What do you remember of your 
mother, Mr. Cooper?” 

“Are you interested in girls, Mr. 
Cooper?” 

“Do you have a close friendship 
with any of the other men in the 
crew, Mr. Cooper? . 

The routine this time seemed 
worse than ever. Actually he’d had 
worse ones, when the medical fash- 
ions of the time called for it, but 
somehow it seemed more annoying 
this time. 

“Five hundred years,” he told the 
doctor. “Five hundred years I’ve 
been living this life and I know 
more about it than you ever will. 
Captain Drago told me on the 
trip to Altair — no, Sirius it was, that 
I was the most devoted man in the 
service. Pete, he said, when you’re 
aboard, I never worry about the 
engines, I’d rather have you sitting 
on them than anybody else. That’s 
the way he talked — sitting on the 
engines, he called it . .” 

The doctor watched Pete 
thoughtfully and made notes on 
the paper before him. And the next 
day the mail brought the message 
that Peter Cooper, Master Engine- 
man First Class, was retired from 
the service. There was a personal 
letter of congratulations from an 
undersecretary, and a notice that his 
pension would start the first of the 
following month. 

“It’s a mistake!” Pete told his 
wife angrily. “Something wrong! 
They didn’t talk to Captain Drago 
like I told them, and — ” 

86 


Nancy’s eyes were indignant. She 
sent him steaming back with fire in 
his eyes, but he couldn’t change the 
decision. He did get as far as the 
office of the doctor who had asked 
him all the fool questions, and he 
saw a paper he wasn’t meant to see. 
It stunned him into temporary si- 
lence. 

But it wasn’t true! Positively 
not! 

Definite signs of senility, the 
notes read. Irritable reaction to 
questioning. Mind wanders, fixes on 
irrelevancies. Preoccupation with 
casual remarks of associates . 

And more. He didn’t tell Nancy 
this, nor did he show her the reply 
he received to his protest. 

“While a search of our records in- 
dicates a subjective — chronological 
age of approximately 48.6 years, 
physiological analysis puts the con- 
dition of your body at a much 
higher figure — it would be guess- 
work to try to name a figure. How- 
ever, recent studies indicate that in- 
terstellar personnel with long terms 
of service tend to age at an in- 
creasingly rapid rate, due probably 
to psychological factors stemming 
from the knowledge of separation 
from the natal culture . 

“We are sorry . .” 

He kept his hair dark and the 
wrinkles smoothed out and forced 
the tiredness from his bones. Other 
things were harder to fake, but 
Nancy wasn’t a demanding wife. 
She thought he was about thirty- 
five, and she thought the blow of 
being dropped from the service had 
taken the life from him. She took 
his part firmly. 

“It’s nothing to be ashamed of, 

JOSEPH FARRELL 



Pete. Not one person in a thousand 
could pass the examination for the 
interstellar service — they’re really 
tough. And we’re together.” 

“What will we live on?” Pete 
demanded, knowing he was being 
too irritable, but unable to control 
it. He waved the pension check. 
“Can we live on that? A fine pay- 
ment for my years of service.” 
Nancy looked dubiously at the 
check. “I thought it was a lot . 
but don’t worry, Pete. You have a 
wife to stand by you.” 

HEN PETE found out how 
his wife had gone about 
standing by him, he was almost 
shocked speechless. Almost. 

“You signed up as my replace- 
ment on the Proxima expedition! 
But you can’t! It’s no job for a 
woman! And you’re leaving me 
alone — for seven or eight years! 
They won’t take you!” 

“They already did.” She smiled 
bravely at him. “As the wife of a 
retired serviceman I had prefer- 
ence. We need the extra money, 
Pete. And it won’t be for long. 
When I come back, we’ll still be 
young enough to enjoy life, darling. 
And they pay well — a few years of 
sacrifice now will make so much 
difference in our future . .” 

Pete closed his eyes and thought 
of how many times he had said the 
same words to starry eyed young 
women. It won’t be long . we’ll 
still be young . good pay . 

Her loving lips tenderly brushed 
his dark hair. 

On nice days, Pete sits in a rock- 


ing chair on the porch with the 
other old men. He doesn’t bother 
to dye his hair any more and he 
reads now with a thick glass, com- 
plaining about the small type they 
use nowadays. The attendants laugh 
off his irritability, and some of the 
visitors who come to see the other 
old men don’t mind listening to his 
stories about the interstellar service. 

When it gets toward dusk, he 
looks into the sky sometimes as the 
stars appear. Centaurus isn’t really 
there, not here in the northern hem- 
isphere, but he looks anyway. Out 
there in space, his wife is doing a 
man’s job. Wonderful woman, Elsie. 

Not Elsie — Nancy. How could he 
have made that mistake. Nancy, a 
laughing young girl who had grown 
swiftly into a strong mature woman 
defending her man and her mar- 
riage vows. 

He leans back and rocks faster 
then, a smile on his face. Sometimes 
the visitors see him and shake their 
heads sympathetically, and some- 
times he sees them doing it, but it 
doesn’t matter. They don’t know. 
They don’t know about his nest egg, 
that insurance policy he’s going to 
collect some day now, because he’s 
going to straighten them out down 
at the interstellar bureau. Captain 
Drago will straighten them out, and 
then he’s going back into space and 
support his wife as a man should. 

And sometimes the smile fades 
and a tear rolls down his cheeks 
when he thinks of Nancy growing 
old and passing away and the in- 
surance man giving him a check 
and a few words of sympathy. But 
a man has to be practical about 
such things. END

Here’s why you should ask for

you get a can opener! 


THE 

SUPER OPENER 

BY 

MICHAEL ZUROY 


UTj'EETCH!” grated Ogden Pilt- 

M. don, president of the Piltdon 
Opener Company, slamming the 
drafting board with his hairy fist, “I 
want results !' 5 

Heads lifted over boards. Kalvin 
Feetch shrunk visibly. 

“As chief engineer you're not 
carrying the ball,” Piltdon went on 
savagely. “The Piltdon Can-Open- 
er is trailing the competition. Ad- 
vertising and Sales are breaking 
their necks. It’s Engineering that 5 s

missing the boat!” 

“But Mr. Piltdon,” remonstrated 
Feetch unsteadily under his employ- 
er’s glare, “don’t you remember? I 
tried to . 

“For two years there hasn’t been 
one lousy improvement in the Pilt- 
don Can-Opener!” roared Mr. 
Piltdon. “Look at our competitors. 
The International rips apart cans 
in three and three-tenths seconds. 
Universal does it in four.” 

“But Mr. Piltdon—” 

“The Minerva Mighty Midget 
does it in four point two two and 
plays Home Sweet Home in chimes. 
Our own Piltdon opener barely 
manages to open a can in eight 
point nine without chimes. Is this 
what I’m paying you for?” 

Feetch adjusted his spectacles 
with shaking hands. “But Mr. Pilt- 
don, our opener still has stability, 
solidity. It is built to last. It has 
dignity ...” 

“Dignity,” pronounced Piltdon, 
“is for museums. Four months, 
Feetch! In four months I want a 
new can-opener that will be faster, 
lighter, stronger, flashier and more 
musical than any other on the mar- 
ket. I want it completely developed, 
engineered and tooled-up, ready for 
production. Otherwise, Feetch — ” 
Feetch’s body twitched. “But Mr. 
Piltdon, four months is hardly time 
enough for development, even with 
an adequate staff. I’ve been trying 
to tell you for years that we’re 
bound to fall behind because we 
don’t have enough personnel to con- 
duct research. Our men can barely 
keep up with production and main- 
tenance. If you would let me put 
on a few draftsmen and . 


“Excuses,” sneered Mr. Piltdon. 
“Your staff is more than adequate. 
I will not allow you to throw out 
my money. Four months, Feetch, no 
more!” Piltdon trudged out of the 
room, leaving behind him an op- 
pressive silence. 

How could you set a time limit 
on research and development? A 
designer had to dream at his board, 
investigate, search, build, test, com- 
pare, discard. He had always 
wanted to devote all his time to re- 
search, but Piltdon Opener had not 
given him that opportunity. Twen- 
ty-five years! thought Feetch. 
Twenty- five years of close supervi- 
sion, dead-lines, production head- 
aches, inadequate facilities and as- 
sistance. What had happened, to 
the proud dream he once had, the 
dream of exploring uncharted en- 
gineering regions, of unlimited time 
to investigate and develop? 

Ah, well, thought Feetch straight- 
ening his thin shoulders, he had 
managed somehow to design a few 
good things during his twenty-five 
years with Piltdon. That was some 
satisfaction. 

What now? He had to hang on 
to his job. Technical work was 
scarce. Since the early 1980’s the 
schools had been turning out more 
technicians than industry could ab- 
sorb. He was too old to compete 
in the employment market. He 
couldn’t afford to lose any money. 
Jenny wasn’t well. 

How to meet this four month 
deadline? He would get right on it 
himself, of course; Hanson — good 
man — could work with him. He 
shook his head despairingly. Some- 
thing would be sure to blow up. 


89 



Well, he had to start— 

“Chief,” said Hanson a few 
weeks later as they entered the lab, 
“I’m beginning to wonder if the 
answer is in the hand mechanical 
type at all.” 

“Got to be,” answered Feetch 
tiredly. “We must work along clas- 
sical can-opener lines. Departures, 
such as the thermal or motor-driven 
types, would be too expensive for 
mass production.” 

Three new models and a group 
of cans were waiting for them on 
the bench. They began testing, 
Hanson operating the openers and 
Feetch clocking. “Four point four,” 
announced Feetch after the last test. 
“Good, but not good enough. Too 
bulky. Appearance unsatisfactory. 
Chimes tinny. We’ve made prog- 
ress, but we’ve a long way to go.” 

The problem was tricky. It might 
seem that use of the proper gear 
ratios would give the required ve- 
locity, but there were too many 
other factors that negated this di- 
rect approach. The mechanism had 
to be compact and streamlined. 
Gear sizes had to be kept down. 
Can-top resistance, internal resist- 
ance, cutting tooth performance, 
handle size and moment, the min- 
imum strength of a woman’s hand 
were some of the variables that had 
to be balanced within rigid limits. 
Sector type cutters, traversing sev- 
eral arcs at the same time, had 
seemed to offer the answer for a 
while, but the adjusting mechanism 
necessary to compensate for vari- 
able can sizes had been too complex 
to be practical. There was the ever- 
present limit to production cost. 

90 


Hanson’s eyes were upon him. 
“Chief,” he said, “it’s a rotten 
shame. Twenty- five years of your 
life you put in with Piltdon, and 
he’d fire you just like that if you 
don’t do the impossible. The Pilt- 
don Company is built upon your de- 
signs and you get handed this 
deal!” 

“Well, well,” said Feetch. “I 
drew my pay every week so I sup- 
pose I have no complaints. Al- 
though,” a wistful note crept into 
his voice “I would have liked a lit- 
tle recognition. Piltdon is a house- 
hold word, but who has heard of 
Feetch? Well,” — Feetch blew his 
nose — “how do we stand, Hanson?” 

Hanson’s bull-dog features drew 
into a scowl. “Piltdon ought to be 
rayed,” he growled. “O.K., Chief. 
Eleven experimental models de- 
signed to date. Two more on the 
boards. Nine completed and tested, 
two in work. Best performance, four 
point four, but model otherwise un- 
satisfactory.” 

“Hello,” said Feetch as an 
aproned machinist entered carrying 
a glistening mechanism. “Here’s 
another model. Let’s try it.” The 
machinist departed and Hanson 
locked the opener on a can. “I 

hope ” he turned the handle, 

and stopped abruptly, staring down 
open-mouthed. 

A cylinder of close-packed beans 
rested on the bench under the 
opener. 

The can itself had disappeared. 

“Chief,” said Hanson. “Chief.” 

“Yes,” said Feetch. “I see it too. 
Try another can.” 

“Vegetable soup or spinach?” in- 
quired Hanson dreamily. 

MICHAEL ZUROY 



“Spinach, I think,” said Feetch. 
“Where did the can go, do you sup- 
pose?” 

The spinach can disappeared. 
Likewise several com cans, sweet 
potato cans and corned-beef hash 
cans, leaving their contents intact. 
It was rather disconcerting. 

“Dear, dear,” said Feetch, re- 
garding the piles of food on the 
bench. “There must be some ex- 
planation. I designed this opener 
with sixteen degree, twenty-two 
minute pressure angle modified in- 
volute gear teeth, seven degree, 
nineteen minute front clearance 
cutter angle and thirty-six degree, 
twelve minute back rake angle. I 
expected that such departures from 
the norm might achieve unconven- 
tional performance, but this — 
Dear, dear. Where do the cans go, 
I wonder?” 

“What’s the difference? Don’t 
you see what you’ve got here? It’s 
the answer! It’s more than the an- 
swer! We can put this right into 
work and beat the dead-line.” 
Feetch shook his head. “No, 
Hanson. We’re producing some- 
thing we don’t understand. What 
forces have we uncovered here? 
Where do the cans go? What makes 
them disappear? Are we dealing 
with a kinetic or a kinematic effect? 
What motions can we plot in the 
area of disappearance and what are 
their analytical mathematical for- 
mulae? What masses may be critical 
here? What transformations of en- 
ergy are involved? No Hanson, we 
must learn a lot more.” 

“But Chief, your job.” 

“I’ll risk that. Not a word to Pilt- 
don” 


Several days later, however, Pilt- 
don himself charged into the draw- 
ing room and slapped Feetch heart- 
ily on the back, causing him to 
break a pencil point. “Feetch!” 
roared Piltdon. “Is this talk that’s 
going around the plant true? Why 
didn’t you tell me? Let’s see it.” 

After Piltdon had seen it his eyes 
took on a feverish glint. “This,” he 
exulted, “will make can-opener his- 
tory. Instantaneous opening! Auto- 
matic disposal! Wait until Adver- 
tising and Sales get hold of this! 
We’ll throttle our competitors! The 
Piltdon Super-Opener we’ll call it.” 

“Mr. Piltdon — ” said Feetch 
shakily. 

Piltdon stared at his chief engi- 
neer sharply. “What’s the matter, 
Feetch? The thing can be dupli- 
cated, can’t it?” 

“Yes sir. I’ve just finished check- 
ing that. But I’m in the midst of 
further investigation of the effect. 
There’s more here than just a new 
type can-opener, sir. A whole new 
field of physics. New principles. 
This is big, Mr. Piltdon. I recom- 
mend that we delay production un- 
til further research can be com- 
pleted. Hire a few top scientists and 
engineers. Find out where the cans 
go. Put out a scientific paper on the 
effect.” 

“Feetch,” bit out Piltdon, his face 
growing hard. “Stow this hooey. I 
don’t give a damn where the cans 
go- May I remind you that under 
our standard patent agreement, all 
rights to your invention belong to 
the company? As well as anything 
you may produce in the field within 
a year after leaving our employ? 
We have a good thing here, and I 


THE SUPER OPENER 


91 



don’t want you holding it back. 
We’re going into production im- 
mediately.” 

C LOSE, thought Feetch, wearily. 

It had been a man-killing job, 
and it had been close, but he’d 
made it. Beat the time limit by a 
half-day. The first tentative ship- 
ments of Piltdon Super-Openers 
had gone to distributors along the 
Eastern seaboard. The first adver- 
tisements blazed in selected media. 
The first reorders came back, and 
then: “It’s a sell-out!” crowed Pilt- 
don, waving a sheaf of telegrams. 
“Step up production! Let ’er rip!” 
The Super-Openers rolled over 
the country. In a remarkably short 
time they appeared in millions of 
kitchens from coast-to-coast. Sales 
climbed to hundreds of thousands 
per day. Piltdon Opener went into 
peak production in three shifts, but 
was still unable to keep up with the 
demand. Construction was begun 
on a new plant, and additional 
plants were planned. Long lines 
waited in front of houseware stores. 
Department stores, lucky enough to 
have Super-Openers on hand, lim- 
ited sales to one to a customer. Pilt- 
don cancelled his advertising pro- 
gram. Newspapers, magazines, 
radio, television and word-of-mouth 
spread the fame of the opener so 
that advertising was unnecessary. 

Meanwhile, of course, govern- 
ment scientists, research founda- 
tions, universities and independent 
investigators began to look into this 
new phenomonen. Receiving no sat- 
isfactory explanation from Piltdon, 
they set up their own research. 

92 


Far into the night burned the 
lights of countless laboratories. 
Noted physicists probed, measured, 
weighed, traced, X-rayed, dissolved, 
spun, peered at, photographed, 
magnetized, exploded, shattered 
and analyzed Super-Openers with- 
out achieving the glimmer of a sat- 
isfactory explanation. Competitors 
found the patent impossible to cir- 
cumvent, for any departure from 
its exact specifications nullified the 
effect. 

Piltdon, genial these days with 
success and acclaim, roared at 
Feetch: “I’m putting you in for a 
raise. Yes sir! To reward you for as- 
sisting me with my invention I’m 
raising your pay two hundred dol- 
lars a year. That’s almost four dol- 
lars a week, man.” 

“Thank you, Mr. Piltdon.” And 
still, thought Feetch wryly, he re- 
ceived no recognition. His name did 
not even appear on the patent. 
Well, well, that was the way it 
went. He must find his satisfaction 
in his work. And it had been inter- 
esting lately, the work he had been 
doing nights at home investigating 
what had been named the Piltdon 
Effect. It had been difficult, work- 
ing alone and buying his own 
equipment. The oscillator and ultra 
microwave tracking unit had been 
particularly expensive. He was a 
fool, he supposed, to try independ- 
ent research when so many huge 
scientific organizations were work- 
ing on it. But he could no more 
keep away from it than he could 
stop eating. 

He still didn’t know where the 
cans went, but somehow he felt that 
he was close to the answer. 


MICHAEL ZUROY 



When he finally found the an- 
swer, it was too late. The Boren- 
chuck incident was only hours 
away. 

As soon as he could get hold of 
Piltdon, Feetch said trembling, 
“Sir, I think I know where those 
cans are going. I recommend — ” 

“Are you still worrying about 
that?” Piltdon roared jovially. 
“Leave that to the long-hairs. We’re 
making money, that’s all that 
counts, eh Feetch?” 

That night, at six-ten p.m., the 
Borenchuck family of Selby, South 
Dakota, sat down to their evening 
meal. Just as they started in on the 
soup, a rain of empty tin cans clat- 
tered down, splashed into the soup, 
raised a welt on the forehead of 
Borenchuck senior, settled down to 
a gentle, steady klunk! klunk! 
klunk! and inexorably began to pile 
up on the dining-room floor. They 
seemed to materialize from a plane 
just below the ceiling. The police 
called the fire department and the 
fire department stared helplessly 
and recommended the sanitation 
department. 

The incident made headlines in 
the local papers. 

The next day other local papers 
in widely scattered locations re- 
ported similar incidents. 

The following day, cans began 
falling on Chicago. St. Louis was 
next, and then over the entire na- 
tion the cans began to rain down. 
They fell outdoors and indoors, usu- 
ally materializing at heights that 
were not dangerous. The deluge fol- 
lowed no pattern. Sometimes it 
would slacken, sometimes it would 


stop, sometimes begin heavily again. 
It fell in homes, on the streets, in 
theatres, trains, ships, universities 
and dog-food factories. No place 
was immune. 

People took to wearing hats in- 
doors and out, and the sale of hel- 
mets boomed. 

All activity was seriously cur- 
tailed. 

A state of national emergency 
was declared. 

Government investigators went 
to work and soon confirmed what 
was generally suspected : these were 
the same cans that had been 
opened by the Piltdon Super- 
Opener. 

Statisticians and mathematicians 
calculated the mean rate of can pre- 
cipitation and estimated that if all 
the cans opened by Piltdon openers 
were to come back, the deluge 
should be over in fifteen point twen- 
ty-nine days. 

Super-Opener sales of course im- 
mediately plummeted to zero and 
stayed there. Anti-Piltdon editorials 
appeared in the papers. Commenta- 
tors accused Piltdon of deliberately 
hoaxing the public for his own gain. 
A Congressional investigation was 
demanded. Piltdon received threats 
of bodily injury. Lawsuits were filed 
against him. He barricaded himself 
in the plant, surrounded by body- 
guards. 

Livid with fury and apprehen- 
sion, he screamed at Feetch, “This 
is your doing, you vandal! I’m a 
ruined man!” A falling can caught 
him neatly on the tip of his nose. 

“But sir,” trembled Feetch, dodg- 
ing three spaghetti cans, “I tried 
to warn you.”

“You’re through, Feetch!” raved 
Piltdon. “Fired! Get out! But be- 
fore you go, I want you to know 
that I’ve directed the blame where 
it belongs. I’ve just released to the 
press the truth about who created 
the Super-Opener. Now, get out!” 
“Yes sir,” said Feetch paling. 
“Then you don’t want to hear about 
my discovery of a way to prevent 
the cans from coming back?” 

Klunk ! A barrage of cans hit the 
floor, and both men took refuge un- 
der Piltdon’s huge desk. “No!” 
yelled Piltdon at Feetch’s face 

which was inches away. “No, I 

What did you say?” 

“A small design improvement sir, 
and the cans would disappear for- 
ever.” 

Klunk! 

“Forever, Feetch?” 

“Yes sir.” Klunk! Klunk! 

“You’re positive, Feetch?” Pilt- 
don’s eyes glared into Feetch’s. 

“Sir, I never make careless 
claims.” 

“That’s true,” said Piltdon. His 
eyes grew dreamy. “It can be done,” 
he mused. “The New Type Super- 
Opener. Free exchanges for the old. 
Cash guarantee that empty cans 
will never bother you. Take a lick- 
ing at first, but then monopolize the 
market. All right, Feetch, I’ll give 
you another chance. You’ll turn 
over all the details to me. The pat- 
ent on the improvement will natur- 
ally be mine. I’ll get the credit for 
rectifying your blunder. Fine, fine. 
We’ll work it out. Hop on produc- 
tion, at once, Feetch.” 

Feetch felt himself sag inwardly. 
“Mr. Piltdon,” he said. “I’m asking 
only one favor. Let me work full 

94 


time on research and development, 
especially on the Piltdon effect. 
Hire a couple of extra men to help 
with production. I assure you the 
company will benefit in the end.” 
“Damn it, no!” roared Piltdon. 
“How many times must I tell you? 
You got your job back, didn’t you?” 
The prospect of long years of 
heavy production schedules, re- 
stricted engineering and tight super- 
vision suddenly made Kalvin 
Feetch feel very tired. Research, he 
thought. Development. What he 
had always wanted. Over the years 
he had waited, thinking that there 
would be opportunities later. But 
now he was growing older, and he 
felt that there might not be a later. 
Somehow he would manage to get 
along. Perhaps someone would give 
him a job working in the new field 
he had pioneered. With a sense of 
relief he realized that he had made 
his decision. 

“Mr. Piltdon,” Feetch said. “I—” 
klunk!— “resign.” 

Piltdon started, extreme aston- 
ishment crossing his face. 

“No use,” said Feetch. “Nothing 
you can say — ” klunk! klunk! 
klunk! — “will make any difference 
now.” 

“But see here, the New Type 
Super-Opener . !” 

“Will remain my secret. Good 
day.” 

“Feetch!” howled Piltdon. “I or- 
der you to remain!” 

Feetch almost submitted from 
force of habit. He hesitated for a 
moment, then turned abruptly. 

“Good-day,” said Feetch firmly, 
sprinting through the falling cans 
to the door. 


MICHAEL ZUROY 



M ONEY, Feetch decided after a 
while, was a good thing to 
have. His supply was running pret- 
ty low. He was not having any luck 
finding another job. Although the 
cans had stopped falling on the fif- 
teenth day, as predicted by the 
statisticians, industry would not 
soon forget the inconvenience and 
losses caused by the deluge. It was 
not anxious to hire the man it re- 
garded as responsible for the whole 
thing. “Feetch,” the personnel man 
would read. “Kalvin Feetch.” 
Then, looking up, “Not the Kalvin 
Feetch who — ” 

“Yes,” Feetch would admit mis- 
erably. 

“I am sorry, but — ” 

He did no better with research 
organizations. Typical was a letter 
from the Van Terrel Foundation: 
“ — cannot accept your application 
inasmuch as we feel your premature 
application of your discovery to 
profit-making denotes a lack of 
scientific responsibility and ethics 
not desirable in a member of 
our organization — former employer 
states the decision was yours entire- 
ly. Unfavorable reference — ” 

Piltdon, Feetch thought, feeling 
a strange sensation deep within his 
chest that he had not the experience 
to recognize as the beginning of a 
slow anger, Piltdon was hitting low 
and getting away with it. 

Of course, if he were to agree to 
reveal his latest discoveries to a re- 
search organization, he would un- 
doubtedly get an appointment. But 
how could he? Everything patent- 
able in his work would automatical- 
ly revert to Piltdon under the one 
year clause in the company patent 

THE SUPER OPENER 


agreement. No, Feetch told himself, 
he was revealing nothing that Pilt- 
don might grab. The anger began 
to mount. 

But he was beginning to need 
money desperately. Jenny wasn’t 
getting any better and medical bills 
were running high. 

The phone rang. Feetch seized it 
and said to the image: “Absolutely 
not.” 

“I’ll go up another ten dollars,” 
grated the little Piltdon image. “Do 
you realize, man, this is the four- 
teenth raise I’ve offered you? A 
total increase of one hundred and 
twenty-six dollars? Be sensible, 
Feetch. I know you can’t find work 
anywhere else.” 

“Thanks to you. Mr. Piltdon, I 
wouldn’t work for you if — ” 

A barrage of rocks crashed 
against the heavy steel screening of 
the window. “What’s going on!” 
yelled Piltdon. “Oh, I see. People 
throwing rocks at your house again? 
Oh, I know all about that, Feetch. I 
know that you are probably the 
most unpopular man alive to-day. 
I know about the rocks, the toma- 
toes, the rotten eggs, the sneaking 
out at night, the disguises you’ve 
had to use. Why don’t you come 
back to us and change all that, 
Feetch? We’ll put out the New 
Type Super-Opener and the world 
will soon forget about the old one.” 

“No,” said Feetch. “People will 
forget anyway — I hope.” 

“If you won’t think of yourself, 
at least think of your fellow work- 
men,” begged Piltdon, his voice go- 
ing blurry. “Do you realize that 
Piltdon Opener will soon be forced 
to close down, throwing all your 

95 



former associates out of work? 
Think of Hanson, Sanchez, Forbes. 
They have families too. Think of 
the men in the shop, the girls in the 
office, the salesmen on the road. 
All, all unemployed because of you. 
Think of that, Feetch.” 

Feetch blinked. This had not oc- 
curred to him. 

Piltdon eyed him sharply, then 
smiled with a hint of triumph. 
“Think it over, Feetch.” 

Feetch sat, thinking it over. Was 
it right to let all these people lose 
their jobs? Frowning, he dialed 
Hanson’s number. 

“Chief,” said Hanson, “Forget 
it. The boys are behind you one 
hundred per cent. We’ll make out.” 
“But that’s the trouble. I thought 
you’d feel like this, and I can’t let 
you.” 

“You’re beginning to weaken. 
Don’t. Think, chief, think. The 
brain that figured the Super-Open- 
er can solve this.” 

Feetch hung up. A glow of anger 
that had been building up in his 
chest grew warmer. He began pac- 
ing the floor. How he hated to do 
it. Think, Hanson had said. But he 
had. He’s considered every angle, 
and there was no solution. 

Feetch walked into the kitchen 
and carefully poured himself a 
drink of water. He drank the water 
slowly and placed the glass on the 
washstand with a tiny click. It was 
the tiny click that did it. Some- 
thing about it touched off the grow- 
ing rage. If Piltdon were there he 
would have punched him in the 
nose. The twenty-five years. The 
tricks. The threats. 

Think? He’d figured the solution 

96 


long ago, only he hadn’t allowed 
himself to see it. Not lack of brains, 
lack of guts. Well, he thought grim- 
ly, dialing Piltdon’s number, he was 
going through with it now. “Pilt- 
don!” he barked. “Three p.m. to- 
morrow. My place. Be here. That’s 
all.” He hung up. 

In the same grim mood the fol- 
lowing morning, he placed a few 
more calls. 

I N the same mood that afternoon 
he stood in the middle of his liv- 
ing-room and looked at his visitors: 
Piltdon, Williams, the Government 
man; Billings from the Van Terrel 
Foundation; Steiner of Westchester 
University; the members of the 
press. 

“Gentlemen,” he said. “I’ll make 
it brief.” He waved the papers in 
his hand. “Here is everything I 
know about what I call the Feetch 
Effect, including plans and specifi- 
cations for the New Type Super- 
Opener. All of you have special rea- 
sons for being keenly interested in 
this information. I am now going to 
give a copy to each of you, provid- 
ing one condition is met by Mr. Pilt- 
don.” He stared at Piltdon. “In 
short, I want fifty-one per cent of 
the stock of Piltdon Opener.” 
Piltdon leaped from his chair. 
“Outrageous!” He roared. “Ridicu- 
lous!” 

“Fifty-one percent,” said Feetch 
firmly. “Don’t bother with any 
counterproposals or the interview 
is at an end.” 

“Gentlemen!” squawked Piltdon, 
“I appeal to you — ” 

“Stop bluffing,” said Feetch cold- 

MICHAEL ZUROY 



ly “There’s no other way out for 
you. Otherwise you’re ruined. Here, 
sign this agreement.” 

Piltdon threw the paper to the 
floor and screamed: “Gentlemen, 
will you be a party to this?” 

“Well,” murmured the Govern- 
ment man, “I never did think 
Feetch got a fair shake.” 

“This information is important 
to science,” said the Van Terrel 
man. 

After Piltdon had signed, the 
papers were distributed. 

Published in the newspapers the 
following day, Feetch’s statement 
read, in part: “The motion in space 
and time of the singular curvilinear 
proportions of the original Super- 
Opener combined with the capaci- 
tor effect built up as it increased 
its frictional electro-static charge in 
inverse proportion to the cube root 
of the tolerance between the invo- 
lute teeth caused an instantaneous 
disruption of what I call the Alpha 
multi-dimensional screen. The can, 
being metallic, dropped through, 
leaving its non-metallic contents be- 
hind. The disruption was instantly 
repaired by the stable nature of the 
screen. 

“Beyond the screen is what I call 
Alpha space, a space apparently 
quite as extensive as our own uni- 
verse. Unfortunately, as my investi- 
gations indicated, Alpha space 
seems to be thickly inhabited. These 
inhabitants, the nature of whom I 
have not yet ascertained, obviously 


resented the intrusion of the cans, 
developed a method of disrupting 
the screen from their side, and 
hurled the cans back at us. 

“However, I have established the 
existence of other spaces up to Mu 
space, and suspect that others exist 
beyond that. Beta space, which is 
also adjacent to our own space, is 
devoid of any form of life. The 
New Type Super-Opener is de- 
signed to pass cans through the 
Beta screen. Beta space will safely 
absorb an infinite number of cans. 

“I sincerely and humbly venture 
the opinion that we are on the 
threshold of tremendous and mighty 
discoveries. It is my belief that pos- 
sibly an infinite number of uni- 
verses exist in a type of laminated 
block separated by screens. 

“Therefore, might it not be that 
an infinite number of laminated 
blocks exist — ?” 


66T\yr R FEETCH—” said Pilt- 
1T1 don. 

Feetch looked up from his desk 
in the newly constructed Feetch 
Multi-Dimensional Development 
Division of the Piltdon Opener 
Company. “Piltdon, don’t bother 
me about production. Production is 
your problem.” 

“But Mr. Feetch—” 

“Get out,” said Feetch. 

Piltdon blanched and left. 

“As I was saying, Hanson — ” 
continued Feetch. END

SKIN 


ENNEDY waited until the 
work of discharge was well un- 
der way, then went ashore. He 
could have left the ship earlier; he 
could, had he so wished it, have 
been the first to leave, but the other 
officers, his juniors, were all mar-

lied, and he was not ; not any 
longer. Still, he reflected, he was 
lucky to have a home to go to. He 
was lucky to have a sister. It would 
be utterly grim to come in from 
Deep Space — especially after a voy- 
age to a drab world like Beta Sex- 
tans III, known to spacemen as the 
Slag Heap — to spend one’s leave in 
dreary hotel rooms. She was a good 
kid, Judith, he thought, even 
though she did marry that stuffed 
shirt of a Colonel. 

The taxi was waiting for him at 
the foot of the gangway. Kennedy 
slung his bags into the passenger 
compartment, followed them. He 
sat back comfortably in his seat as 
the whirling vanes lifted him clear 
of the spaceport with its busy 
cranes and gantries and conveyor 
belts, the gleaming ships that looked 
like huge spinning tops scattered by 
some giant child. 

“A good voyage, Mister?” asked 
the driver. 

“No,” said Kennedy. “Lousy. It’s 
good to be back on Earth. I hope 
they send us somewhere better next 
trip.” 

“Where’ re you in from?” asked 
the driver. “It looked like metal 
you were discharging. Slabs and in- 
gots . 

“Beta Sextans III,” replied Ken- 
nedy. “The Slag Heap. Three 
months from Earth even with the 
Ehrenhaft Drive running flat out, 
and when you get there it’s nothing 
but a big ball of rubble where it 
rains for three hundred and ninety 
days out of the four hundred that 
make its year. There’s no surface 
vegetation except for a few things 
like Terran lichens. There’ re fungi 

100 


in the caves and tunnels — that’s 
where the natives live. They come 

out on fine days, I’m told ” 

“What are they like?” asked the 
driver. “I’ve heard tales those extra- 
Terran women — I’ve often wished 
that I’d gone into Astronautics my- 
self—” 

“One trip to the Slag Heap 
would cure you of wishing,” said 
Kennedy. “You’ve seen chimpan- 
zees? Try to imagine albino chim- 
panzees that have a bath every six 
months. Oh, they’re intelligent, up 
to a point. They work in the mines 
and the smelters, and get paid in 
gin and tobacco. The overseeing is 
done by Earthmen. The poor devils 
are out on a three-year contract.” 
“What do they do?” 

“What can they do? They drink, 
they watch the films — ancient ones 
— and they drink. I’ve heard some 
of them have tried giving the na- 
tive women — if you can call them 
that — a good wash and employing 
them as housekeepers, so there’s 
been labor trouble, with floggings 
and shootings — ” 

“Sounds like a jolly place,” said 
the driver. “It wouldn’t do me. 
Come to think of it — when I pick 
you officers up at the spaceport 
you usually have bags and boxes 
full of souvenirs you’ve brought 
home with you. All you have is one 
grip and one suitcase. Looks like 
there aren’t even any curios worth 
picking up on that world of yours.” 
“It’s no world of mine, thank 
God,” said Kennedy. “Oddly 
enough, I did strike something 
worth bringing home, though — ” 

Gently, the taxi dropped down to 
BERTRAM CHANDLER 



the flat roof of the block in which 
Judith lived. Kennedy paid the 
driver, then carried his bags to the 
elevator. Seconds later he was walk- 
ing along the passageway to his sis- 
ter’s suite. She opened the door as 
he approached it. 

“Bill!” she cried, “it’s good to see 
you back! Come in — your room’s 
ready for you.” 

“It’s good to see you again, 
Judith,” he said, dropping his bags 
and hugging her. “It’s good to have 
a home to come back to.” 

“It’s good to have a big brother,” 
she replied, leading him into the 
lounge. 

“How’s the Colonel?” 

“I wish that you wouldn’t keep 
referring to Jim as the Colonel,” 
she objected. 

“But he is so a Colonel,” insisted 
Kennedy. “You could never take 
him for anything else. I shall be 
quite surprised if you don’t snap to 
attention when he comes in to- 
night . .” 

“He’ll not be coming in tonight,” 
said Judith. “He’s got a tour of 
garrison duty on the Moon. As a 
matter of fact I should have gone 
there with him — but I insisted on 
being home to welcome you in.” 

“You shouldn’t have done that,” 
said Kennedy. 

“And why shouldn’t I? You’re 
my best big brother. Anyhow, I had 
to stay to see what you’ve brought 
me this time.” 

“Mercenary cat. I told you, be- 
fore I left, what sort of a world Beta 
Sextans III is. Well — it is just that, 
and worse. A slag heap in a cold 
drizzle, crawling with butterfly 
brained apes . .” 

SISTER UNDER THE SKIN 


“I’m going to sulk,” she said. 

“Will you pour me another 
beer?” 

“No” 

“All right, all right — you’ve 
blackmailed me into it.” 

Kennedy got to his feet, opened 
his suitcase. He lifted out a civilian 
suit and then, carefully, a lustrous 
golden fur. 

“But this is lovely!” cried Judith. 
She almost snatched it from him, 
held it against her cheek. “It’s beau- 
tiful!” 

“And it matches your hair,” said 
Kennedy. “But look at it carefully. 
Look at the cunning way in which 
the animal was skinned . .” 

“Why spoil things?” asked his 
sister. “Women love fur — but they 
don’t like to be reminded of the — 
preliminaries.” 

“Even so,” insisted the spaceman, 
“it’s interesting. You’ve seen tiger 
skins and bear skins, of course, to 
say nothing of that birix pelt I 
brought home from Spica II — Are 
you still using it as a bedside rug, 
by the way?” 

“Yes. Well, as a matter of fact 
Jim got rather huffy when I refused 
to come to the Moon with him and 
said that he was going to have some 
home comforts, and took it with 
him.” 

“Trust the Colonel. Well — you 
can use this until he comes back. 
After that — have it made up. But 
we’re wandering away from the 
point. The average pelt, as I said, 
has to be cut to remove it from the 
animal. This — well, it may have 
been cut, but I don’t think so. It’s 
just as though every morsel of flesh, 
every splinter of bone, was vapor- 

101 



ised and blown out — ” 

“Never mind the details. What 
was the animal, anyhow?” 

“I can’t remember the native 
name — and if I could I couldn’t 
pronounce it. We call it O’Grady’s 
Mole — O’ Grady was one of the of- 
ficers of the survey ship that made 
the first landing; he stumbled on a 
sort of colony of the things in one 
of the caves. As a matter of fact, 
they’re supposed to be protected — ” 
“Won’t you get into trouble for 
having this skin?” 

“I could, I suppose. But I didn’t 
kill the mole myself, and there’s no 
law to stop the natives from doing 
it — after all, it’s their world. All 
that can happen is a new Standing 
Order to the effect that personnel 
will not, repeat not > buy furs, pelts 
or skins from the aborigines of Beta 
Cygni III—” 

“How did you get it, then?” 
“Well, as I’ve already told you, 
the Slag Heap is a grim world. 
You’re far better off staying aboard 
the ship — but, sooner or later, you 
have to go ashore for a breather or 
start climbing up the wall paper. 
You go ashore, and what’s there to 
do?” 

“Knowing you,” she said, “I can 
guess.” 

“How right you are. (My glass 
is empty, by the way . .) Well, 
there’s a sort of village where the 
overseers and the clerical staff live. 
They have a couple of pubs. 
They’re far from jolly places — 
you’d think that the boys in charge 
of the mines and the works would 
be pleased to see a few new faces, 
but they’re not. They’re a sullen 
crowd. 

102 


“Anyhow, this night in question, 
there were four of us from the ship 
at one end of the bar — the Old 
Man, the Second Pilot, the Doctor 
and myself — and a bunch of the 
locals at the other. Each party was 
keeping to itself. Suddenly there 
was a commotion at the door. We 
looked round. One of the natives 
was trying to force his way in, and 
two hairy faced, hairy chested over- 
seers who looked just about as hu- 
man as the natives were trying to 
keep him out. 

“Well, it was none of our busi- 
ness. If we lived in Africa we’d take 
a dim view of baboons forcing their 
presence upon us while we were en- 
joying a quiet beer. We were ignor- 
ing the whole affair when the na- 
tive, who seemed to know some 
English, started shouting out, 
‘Spacemen! Must see spacemen! 
Must see Captain!’ 

“This direct appeal to the Old 
Man had results. 

“He said, in his best Control 
Room voice, ‘Let him in.’ 

“ ‘He’s not coming in here, Mis- 
ter,’ said the barman. 

“The Old Man just loves being 
called Mister. 

“ ‘My man,’ he said, ‘I would re- 
mind you that I, as Master of an 
interstellar ship, rank with, but not 
below, the Governor of a Third 
Grade Colony — ’ 

“He was right, of course — and 
the bartender knew sufficient inter- 
stellar law to recognise it. He said, 
however, that he would send a re- 
port in to the Commission, and the 
Old Man said that there were many 
things that he could mention in his 
report, including miscegenation — 

BERTRAM CHANDLER 



And this threat brought results. 

“So they let the native in. He 
looked pitiful standing there under 
the glaring lights — a huge, sham- 
bling brute with filthy, matted white 
fur, almost human, but not quite; 
here, in this bar, an alien on his 
own world. In one big, gnarled 
hand he carried a limply hanging 
sack. 

“I heard two of the overseers 
whispering together. ‘Yes — That’s 
him. Dangerous bastard — cause of 
all the trouble — ’ And, ‘You can 
hardly blame him — Ken Slater 
shouldn’t have taken both his wom- 
en — ’ Then, ‘Christ! Are you a 
monkey lover the same as these 
bloody spacemen?’ 

“The Old Man overheard this 
last. He said, ‘We’re not monkey 
lovers — but we believe in fair play.’ 
To the native he said, ‘What do 
you want?’ 

“ ‘Captain, sir, 5 — I wish that I 
could put the accent across proper- 
ly; it was like a dog talking in broad 
Glaswegian — ‘do trade.’ 

“ ‘All right. What’s in the bag ? 5 
“ ‘This, Captain sir.’ 

“And so he pulled out, one by 
one, five of the pelts. The locals 
were furious. Nobody offered them 
bargains like that. And they were 
bargains, too. Do you know how 
much I paid for this?” 

“No , 55 said Judith. “But I can tell 
you that this pelt, on Earth, would 
take all of Jim’s monthly pay, and 
yours too.” 

“I paid , 55 Kennedy told her, “just 
one bottle of gin. That’s all that any 
of us paid, except for the Old Man. 
He paid two — but he got two furs 
— I suppose you’re going to have

it made up into a coat?” 

“Not yet, Bill. Not until Jim gets 
back from his tour of duty. I miss 
my bedside rug.” 

“As you please,” he said. “It’s 
your fur. And now, my dear sister, 
what about climbing into something 
glamorous and doing the rounds of 
the night spots with me?” 

“As you please, Bill. But I know 
you, and know that you’d sooner 
spend your first night at home at 
home. I’ve got steak, and I’ll do it 
the way you like, with lots of garlic. 
There’s a bottle of Burgundy. 
There’s a big hunk of that stinking 
English Stilton.” 

“You’re an angel. Remind me to 
get you a pair of wings next trip.” 
She refilled his glass. “It’s a funny 
thing. I’ve often heard you and the 
Colonel grumbling about this apart- 
ment, complaining that it has no 
windows, no natural light — That, 
to a spaceman, is a point in its 
favour. We see enough of the sky 
and the stars. When we get home 
we like to forget about ’em.” 

T HREE DAYS later Kennedy 
was told that all the cargo had 
been discharged from his ship and 
that Lloyd’s Surveyor would be 
making the routine inspection of 
the hull. A Survey was a job for 
the ship’s own Chief Officer, and 
not for the spaceport relieving staff. 
Judith accompanied him up to the 
roof, where the taxi was waiting for 
him. 

“Pity it’s such a dull day,” said 
Kennedy. “Weather Control must 
have slipped up. You won’t be able 
to get in your sunbathing.”

• • • 


“I’ll manage,” she said. “There’s 
plenty to do about the house. Don’t 
work too hard, Bill. Give me a ring 
when you’re ready to come home.” 

He enjoyed the flight from the 
city to the spaceport. He looked 
down with pride at his gleaming 
ship as the helicopter drifted in to 
a landing. He climbed the ramp 
to the main airlock with a certain 
eagerness, whistled softly and hap- 
pily as the elevator whisked him up 
to the Officers’ flat. In his cabin 
he changed into protective clothing, 
then sat down to wait for the Sur- 
veyor and the Astronautical Super- 
intendent. 

The survey did not take long. No 
plates and no structural members 
were in need of renewal. Kennedy 
would have been free, then, but for 
the fact that it had been impossible 
during the forenoon — cabin stores 
were being loaded — to test the 
main airlock doors. 

So Kennedy lunched on board, 
his only companion at table being 
the elderly, grounded ex Chief Of- 
ficer who undertook relieving duties 
aboard the ships in port. The old 
man was not a brilliant conversa- 
tionalist. Kennedy found him rather 
boring. After lunch — the survey of 
the airlock doors would not be for 
another hour or so — Kennedy re- 
tired to his cabin, lit his pipe and 
pulled from his bookcase a well- 
thumbed volume of Kipling. 

He was reading happily when 
there was a knock at his door. 

“Come in!” he said, rather testi- 
ly. He finished reading the verse be- 
fore looking up to see who his caller 
was. 

104 


The Colonel’s lady and Judy 
O 3 Grady, 

Sisters under their skins . .” 

“What did you do with your 
skin?” asked a voice. 

Kennedy looked up, saw that it 
was the ship’s Surgeon. 

“What brings you back, Doc?” 
he asked. “Loading’s not started 
yet.” 

“Never mind the loading. What 
did you do with your skin?” 

“My skin? Oh, you mean those 
pelts we got at Port Debenham — 
I took it home, of course. My sister 
has it now. What’s the flap? Cus- 
toms?” 

“No, Bill, it’s worse. Your sister 
hasn’t had the skin made up into 
a coat, I hope. I tell you — once 
those skins get out into sunlight 
they’re dangerous!” 

“Why?” asked Kennedy. 

“I’ll tell you. It so happens that 
Marilyn — my wife — is allergic to 
fur, even to extra-Terran fur. As 
soon as I unpacked the thing she 
started to sneeze. She said that she 
appreciated such a lovely present, 
but that I, as a medical man, should 
have known that, as far as she was 
concerned, it was quite impossible. 

“Well, I’m well in with the boys 
at the Department of Extra-Terran 
Biology, and I thought that they’d 
be glad of the pelt. The next morn- 
ing I took it round to them. The 
following morning they rang me, 
saying that it was urgent that I 
come round to see them at once. 

“I’ll skip the biology of it all. I’ll 
just tell you in words of one sylla- 
ble what happened at the lab. 
They’re a distrustful lot of beggars. 
They work on the assumptipn that 

BERTRAM CHANDLER 



the average spaceman is an incom- 
petent bungler. They assumed that 
nobody aboard the ship had the 
savvy to sterilize the furs. After tak- 
ing samples to be checked for 
micro-organisms, they proceeded 
with the sterilization. They used all 
sorts of radiation, including ultra 
violet. When they were using the 
ultra violet the skin came to life — 
it tried to eat one of the lab tech- 
nicians . .” 

“Impossible,” said Kennedy. 

“It’s not impossible! Here’s the 
way that they doped it out. 
O’Grady’s Mole is as near as, 
dammit, immortal. When its body 
is worn out, it comes to the surface 
and dies. Flesh and bone are either 
absorbed into the skin or blow away 
as dust. Sooner or later the empty 
skin will be found by one of the 
aborigines, and used as rough cloth- 
ing of a sort. Sooner or later the 
aborigine will be wearing the skin, 
on the surface of the planet, on one 
of the rare fine days. What hap- 
pens then is simple — there’ll be one 
aborigine less and one O’Grady’s 
Mole the more. 

“Anyhow, the flap was on. We 
got all the skins back but yours. 
The Captain’s wife was lucky — she 
laid both her furs out on the flat 
roof to air. When we got there she 
was in hysterics. Two odd looking 
things, like three-quarter deflated 
balloons covered with golden fur, 
were flopping round the roof. They 


had once been Pekingese dogs — ” 
“I gave the skin to my sister,” 
said Kennedy. “She’s using it as a 
bedside rug for the time being. 
Luckily she lives in one of those in- 
side, fully air-conditioned apart- 
ments. There’s no danger.” 

“Even so,” said the Doctor, 
“you’d better go to her straight 
away and get the skin back.” 

“I’ve got a Survey.” 

“Damn your Survey! Can’t you 
see, Bill, that those natives hate the 
guts of all Earthmen? Selling the 
skins to us was a way to get re- 
venge. There’s no time to lose!” 
“You’re right,” said Kennedy. 
“I’ll ring Judith ancj tell her to lock 
the skin in a cupboard.” 

He went out to the wardroom to 
use the telephone. When he came 
back his face was pale. 

He said, “She doesn’t answer. 
But she’s out shopping probably.” 
“We’d better hurry!” 

They hurried. 

There was nobody in the flat — 
nobody human, that is. 

There was a thing that shambled 
to meet them, walking clumsily on 
all fours, skidding on the polished 
floor. 

Kennedy looked over the golden 
furred back of the brute to the 
open bedroom door, saw the articles 
of clothing scattered on the bed, 
saw the overturned sun ray lamp 
still burning. END

BY IRVING FANG 


I T’S HAD it. Finished. Done. My 
wonderful red Thunderflash, I 
thought to myself, isn’t worth the 
electricity to atomize it to Kingdom 
Come. 

Ever since that drunk in his two- 
seat Charioteer plowed into the 
rear end with such force that even 
my radar repellant couldn’t stop it, 
my Thunderflash had been out of 
kilter. The specialists my garage 
recommended worked over it for 



two days, but couldn’t get it to run- 
ning the way it did new. 

And what was I supposed to do 
for an automobile now? I had 
signed the customary 40-year pact 
for half my salary to pay for it. 
That meant I would still be shell- 
ing out by 2117. 

Weeping over it wasn’t going to 
do any good. It was stuck on the 
fifth level expressway and that was 
that. I levered myself out (at least 
the ejector still worked) then got 
behind the car and gave it a good 
old-fashioned push to get it on an 
off-ramp, out of the stream of traf- 
fic. 

After I parked I remembered I 
was heading for a date with Jenny. 
I checked my wallet. No, not 
enough for a taxi there. I would 
just have to phone her to cancel the 
date. 

Reluctantly I pushed the tip of 
my tongue against my tooth tele- 
phone. 

“Operator,” said the operator. 

“Poplar 3104, please.” 

“Thank you. One moment. I’ll 
ache it for you.” 

She dialed the number of the 
tooth telephone in Jenny’s mouth, 
so the two fine wires sent gentle 
electric currents into the nerve. On 
the third ache Jenny clicked the 
receiver open with the tip of her 
tongue. 

“Hello?” 

“Jenny, this is Arnold. I won’t 
be able to come over this evening.” 

“But we had a date,” Jenny said 
in a petulant voice. 

“I know, but my car broke 
down.” 

“Again?” 


“Yes, honey.” 

“Why don’t you do something 
about it?” Jenny complained. 

“But baby, what can I do? I’ve 
been to the garage. I’ve been to the 
specialists. I’m so broke on account 
of these repair bills I’ve been living 
on macaroni concentrate for the 
last couple of weeks.” 

Jenny, my beautiful sweetheart, 
was distinctly unhappy. “Don’t 
come to me with your troubles,” 
she replied. “In fact, you don’t have 
to come to me at all until you can 
come like a gentleman.” 

“Aw, listen just a minute, Jen- 
ny,” I started to plead. But it was 
too late. Jenny had clicked off. 

A fine thermokettle of fish! A 
month ago I had a shiny lifetime 
car and was romancing the best 
looking girl in town. Then one 
drunk comes along and my car is 
next to useless and my girl is mad 
at me. 

Feeling in a distinctly blue mood 
I moved my tongue to the other 
side of my mouth and shoved on 
my tooth radio. I rolled the tongue 
over the bottom of the tooth until 
I got a program with some blues 
music. Just the way I felt. The 
blues. I sat in the front seat of my 
Thunderflash and listened to the 
music echoing against my tonsils. 

After the song came the inevi- 
table commercial. Only this was a 
new one. The announcer said: 
“Here’s some big, big, big news 
from Grinning Gregory, your largest 
volume dealer in lifetime cars. 
Gregory announced today that his 
used people lots are nearly empty. 
Yes, Grinning Gregory’s used peo- 
ple lots are nearly empty. And that 


107 



means good, good, good news for 
you car owners with lifetime con- 
tracts who would like new cars. 

“Grinning Gregory has added to 
his stocks of new Orions, Thunder- 
flashes, Galaxies, Solars, Chariot- 
eers, Protons and Fords. For the 
first time in two years, yes, the first 
time in two years, he has more new 
cars than new people to sell them 
to. 

“So he is offering a limited num- 
ber of them to used people, you 
folks who have had cars, on his con- 
veniently located used people lots. 
Gome on down and let some of 
Grinning Gregory’s new cars look 
you over. Be sure and bring photo- 
stats of your credit ratings and of- 
ficial car histories. Hurry, hurry, 
hurry and avoid the rush to Grin- 
ning Gregory’s used people lots.” 

The commercial ended and was 
replaced by music. 

Gosh, that was exciting news. 
Ever since the accident I had given 
up hope of ever owning a decent 
running car again, automobile 
prices and government restrictions 
being what they were. 

I clicked on my tooth telephone 
and ached my garage mechanic to 
come by and pick up my car. Then 
I took my credit rating and official 
car history from the glove compart- 
ment and caught a helibus to the 
nearest of Grinning Gregory’s used 
people lots. 

A LOT of guys were already 
there before me, most of them 
in the same fix I was. They had 
been in accidents or they were di- 
vorced and their wives got custody 

108 


of the car, although they still had 
to pay for it. 

Some of them had been on the 
lot for some time and looked a little 
shopworn under the lights and flut- 
tering pennants, but they hadn’t 
found a car yet that would take 
them. We were all classified as used 
people, a lot less desirable than peo- 
ple who hadn’t signed for cars yet. 

One of Grinning Gregory’s con- 
tract brokers lined us up in a row 
facing the path the cars would 
come by robot direction. The fellow 
to my right slicked his hair down 
neatly and began shining his shoe- 
tops on the backs of his trouser legs. 

“Sure hope I get selected,” he 
whispered nervously to me. “Boy, 
don’t you sometimes wish you were 
living a couple of hundred years 
ago when cars were cheap enough 
so that people were doing the pick- 
ing?” 

“Not me,” I told him. “Drive 
that junk? I’ll admit you didn’t 
have to swear but a couple of years 
of your life away. But look at all 
you get now in a car.” 

“Mmm, I suppose you’re right,” 
he said. “My Orion was stolen a 
year ago when I accidentally cut 
off the burglar photocell. The po- 
lice never did find it and I’ve been 
trying ever since to get another 
one.” 

“This is the first time I’ve tried,” 
I said. “My car . .” 

“Ssh,” he interrupted. “Here 
they come.” 

A procession of new cars, led by 
a beautiful green Solar convertible, 
inched its way along the row of 
hopeful buyers, all of us with our 
credit ratings and car histories 


IRVING FANG 



pinned to our lapels. 

Each car’s robot mechanism re- 
corded our statistics, took our pic- 
tures, noted our heights, weights 
and appearances, then began to 
correlate the data. 

By government order the robot 
mechanism was directed to select 
its most promising future owner. A 
sobersides bank president, for ex- 
ample, might dearly love to change 
his big black Galaxy sedan for a 
low-slung Charioteer sports car, but 
sports cars were planned with crew- 
cutted college boys in mind, so the 
bank president would be likely to 
end up with another big Galaxy. 
Of course, the payment rate was 
fixed and the contracts were almost 
always for 40 years. A tie salesman 
might want a Galaxy to make an 
impression on his neighbors, but 
he’d probably wind up with a 
Proton or a Thunderflash like I 
had. I was a tie salesman. 

The Solar came abreast of me. I 
stood straight and smiling as it be- 
gan to note my statistics. It flashed 
a 23 when it was done. 

Not so good. That put me in the 
23 percentile rank of its desirability. 
The next car, a rhinestone Ford, 
gave me a 28. I was rated 22, 31, 
14 (by a Galaxy), 27, 35 and 30 by 
the next six cars. That was the way 
it went for the whole procession. I 
received the highest rating, 58, 
from an experimental model Proton 
that was no longer in production, 
but I knew it was rating everybody 
higher and I was pretty gloomy. 

Imagine my surprise when my 
name was called out as one of the 
possible choices. I went into the 
broker’s office and was told the 


Proton would select me if I would 
get rid of all but ten years of my 
Thunderflash contract. That meant 
I had to find someone to take my 
car and 27 years of my contract, 
since I had been paying for three 
years of the 40. The price of the 
Proton, the broker told me, was 
scaled down to a 30-year contract 
because it was an off-model. 

But who would take my heap 
with a 27-year contract attached to 
it? The broker said Grinning Greg- 
ory might go for five years, just out 
of the goodness of his big, big, big 
heart. I wouldn’t get that kind of a 
deal anywhere else, the broker said. 

Maybe I wouldn’t, but that 
didn’t do me much good. I needed 
someone to take 27 years. 

Harry! Why didn’t I think of 
Harry before? He didn’t have a car 
yet. Skinflint Harry didn’t want to 
sign the standard 40-year contract 
for a car and he had been shopping 
around for second-hand cars. Be- 
sides, good old Harry knew how 
crazy I was about Jenny. He had 
even taken her out a couple of 
times. 

I gave Harry an ache on the tele- 
phone and told him I’d be right 
over. Then I ached the garage and 
the mechanic told me he could get 
my Thunderflash in pretty good 
running condition again, even 
though he couldn’t promise any- 
thing permanent. I caught a heli- 
bus to my friend’s apartment. 

“Harry, old pal, I’ve got the 
chance of a lifetime for both of us.” 

Harry eyed me suspiciously. 
“How’s that?” he asked. 

“Well, here’s the deal. You know 
my real fine Thunderflash? You

it was a sharp car. It is. It s 
a first class car. But ever since that 
slight accident, I’ve had just a wee 
bit of trouble with it. Not much, 
you understand, but it’s niggling 
enough to annoy my girl, Jenny. 
You remember Jenny, the girl you 
used to go with before I cut you 
out? Ha! Ha! Anyhow, Jenny 
wants me to get another car. A 
newer one.” 

“But how can you?” Harry 
asked. “You already have one.” 
“That’s just it, old buddy,” I 
replied. “Grinning Gregory has one 
of those experimental model Pro- 
tons. It’s a beauty, shimmering 
orange with purple wheels and 
bearskin upholstery. You’d love it. 
They’ll let me have it on a 30-year 
contract if I can sell 27 years of my 
Thunderflash contract. So here’s 
what I’m going to do for you, pal. 
I’ll keep ten years of the contract 
and let you have the Thunderflash 
for the rest. You’ll be getting a 
three-year- old car with 13 years of 
the contract taken care of. Now is 
that a deal or is that a deal!” 
Harry wasn’t convinced. “What’s 
wrong with your car?” 

“Oh, hardly anything.” 

“What’s hardly anything?” 

“Not even worth mentioning.” 
“What’s not worth mentioning?” 
“To tell the truth, the frame is 
just the least trifle out of line and 
every once in a great while it makes 
the rear wheel twist sideways.” 

“I don’t know,” said Harry. 
“Good old cautious, hard-headed 
Harry,” I told him. “You are get- 
ting the deal of a lifetime and do- 
ing a good, loyal friend a big favor 
besides.” 


“I still don’t know, Arnold,” said 
Harry. 

“All right. When will you 
know?” 

“Let me sleep on it tonight.” 

“OK, Harry.” 

I went home in high spirits. I 
knew Harry would come through 
for me and take that wreck off my 
hands. He always was a man with 
an eye out for a deal. 

I slept late the next morning, 
but by afternoon I was over to the 
used people lot to tell them to hold 
the Proton for me for another day. 
Instead, they tapped me over the 
head with the news that someone 
came in that morning and bought 
it. And they didn’t have another 
one like it that would accept me. 

Another hope gone astray! I 
caught a helibus to the garage and 
picked up my Thunderflash after 
paying a whopping repair bill. I 
drove to Jenny’s house to convince 
her it was just as good as new. 

Jenny’s mother met me at the 
door. 

“Hello, Arnold,” she said with 
the big smile of greeting she always 
gave me. “I’m glad to see you and 
I hope you’ll keep dropping over to 
see me, but Jenny isn’t here any 
more.” 

“Not here?” 

“I’m afraid not.” 

“Where is she?” 

“She eloped less than an hour 
ago. You remember the boy she 
used to go with, Harry? He came 
by in a beautiful new car. It was 
shimmering orange with purple 
wheels and bearskin upholstery 
and ...” END

Health was no longer a problem for the 


aged. All they had to do was ban sex and 


tobacco to those over thirty-five . 


C HUCK DANE patted shaving lotion on his face, en- 
joying the second of vicious sting. He closed the medi- 
cine cabinet and stood for a minute examining himself in 
the fluorescent lighted mirror. He was lean and hard and, 
of course, tanned. A few grey hairs flecked the sideburns, 
but he didn’t think that he looked thirty-five. And, damn 

it all to hell! he didn’t 
feel thirty-five! 

He opened the bath- 
room door, and hesitated. 
He dreaded to walk 
through the photoelectric 
beam and set off that 
odious disc ! Sometimes he 
got down on hands and 
knees and crawled under. 
But he felt so damn silly! 

Well, he couldn’t stand 
there all day. It was Mon- 
day and they would ex- 
pect him at the office. 

He squared his shoul- 
ders and walked into the 
hall. 

“Lung Cancer, Heart Attacks! 

Heart Attacks, Lung Cancer! 

Beware, old man, Be . ware!” 

The tinkly message followed him up the hall. “I could

it at daily Gov-Apts Inspection and 
report me again!” 

He pushed his hands into his 
pants pockets and walked into the 
dining ell. He slouched in his chair, 
and watched Sally swish back and 
forth from the kitchen as she set 
the table. She was in blue nylon 
pajamas and fuzzy blue mules. Her 
red hair was tied up in a provoc- 
ative pony tail. 

She felt him watching her, gave 
him a devilish grin. “Sleep well last 
night, dear? In your own little 
bed?” 

“You know damn well I didn’t!” 
God, he wanted a cigarette. After 
two years he still wanted one! 
When would the hunger for them 
ever stop? 

“You knew where I was sleep- 
ing. The door was unlocked!” 

She came to him, suddenly com- 
passionate, and sat on his lap. She 
pulled his head against her. He felt, 
on his face, the slickness of the 
nylon, and underneath her firm 
body. She whispered, “You know 
honey, no matter what the govern- 
ment says, I’m not made for sleep- 
ing alone!” 

“And I’m thirty-five and not 
’spose to!” 

“Thirty-five and eighty-nine 
days! How well I know! The 
toast!” 

She scooted off his lap and ran 
into the kitchen. How she managed 
to burn toast in an electronic 
toaster beat him. By sending it 
down twice, he suspected. 

He picked up the paper by his 
plate and unfolded it. The first 
page, as usual, was devoted to the 
Propagandists. Headlines pro- 

112 


claimed: “375 died this weekend 
doing you know what ” The second 
line asked: “Will you be next?” 

It made a good story because 
only three hundred deaths had been 
predicted. The bottom half of the 
page was filled with pictures of 
the victims and the spouses who 
“lead them on, knowing at the time 
that over forty percent of the heart 
attacks in men and women over 
thirty-five are brought on by sex- 
ual relations.” 

Sally was leaning over him, serv- 
ing his plate with scrambled eggs 
and ham, but he tried to ignore her 
and turned to the next page. Here 
was an editorial by the Depart- 
ment of Health. He scanned it. 
Same old thing. Sex to be avoided 
like poison by all persons, male 
and female, over thirty-five years. 

Chuck forked a piece of soya 
bread, and swabbed the last of 
ham grease and egg from his plate. 
He sat drinking his soya hot choco- 
late, and wanting a cigarette. 

Sally finished eating, stretched, 
and the nylon threatened to rip. 
She went and got his suit coat and 
hat. At the door he tried to kiss her 
goodbye in his best “big brother” 
manner. But she clinched in close, 
and suddenly he didn’t feel like a 
brother. 

She whispered in his ear, “Come 
on back. I’ll call and tell them you 
caught a virus!” 

He almost took off his hat. Then 
he said, “You know it would show 
up in my weekly S-Count!” He 
shuddered just saying the words. 
God! how he hated that! He con- 
tinued, “And if I slip once or twice 
on that, you know what they do.” 

VIRGIL F. SHOCKLEY 



Feeling sorry for her, he added 
half-heartedly, “But you’re only 
thirty. And I wouldn’t blame you 
. Lot of people do, you know.” 

She leaned back, still in his arms, 
and laughed up at him. “No, I’ll 
wait and break you down!” 

“Even knowing what they’re like- 
ly to do?” 

“But surely! Then at least the 
temptation wouldn’t be so handy!” 

He walked rapidly toward the 
office. Other groups walked along 
talking and laughing. Here and 
there someone called to him. 

He came to U.S. 75, a deserted 
graying eight lane strip. As he 
started across, a bike came over 
the rise and he dived into the ditch. 
But it was only a Catholic priest 
pedalling furiously along on a girl’s 
bicycle. Then there had been 
another clash! He climbed out of 
the ditch, and walked a ways down 
the highway. There it was. The 
priest was just climbing off ^ the 
bike, and there was a motorcycle 
cop. 

Chuck Dane walked up the high- 
way to the scene and stood watch- 
ing. The priest was kneeling, his 
black bag open, administering last 
rites to the two youths. 

The cop, fat and redfaced, came 
over and stood beside Chuck. “Two 
less Teenagers!” he grinned. 

“Dying, eh?” Chuck asked. 

“Dying or dead! These damn 
kids!” He said it with just a tinge 
of envy. 

The Father snapped his bag shut, 
and pedalled away. Chuck went 
over for a closer look. Both of the 
kids were on roller skates, the 
powered kind. Chuck Dane noted 

THE DOWNHILL SIDE OF THIRTY 


with satisfaction that they were 
Airex skates. 

Both of the kids had on the 
regular uniform, black leather 
jackets, and leather belts eight 
inches wide. Mounted on the center 
front of the belts were the regula- 
tion three foot razor sharp spears. 
Only now there was not much of 
the spears to be seen. Because 
neither kid had chickened. The 
shorter boy had caught a spear in 
the lower chest, and the taller one 
caught it in the guts. 

Funny, Chuck Dane thought, 
staring down at them. Even in this 
cotton batting, vacuum world of 
1990 the Teenagers could find ways 
to kill each other off! He envied 
them their spirit! 

He waved at the cop, who was 
calling in a report, and walked 
back up the highway. When he 
got to his usual place, he started 
to cross. 

“Ola!” 

In that frantic second, he saw 
only the black leather jacket bear- 
ing down upon him. And the bike 
with the spear mounted on the 
handlebars, the tip sparkling like 
a diamond in the sun. It swerved, 
and came straight for him. Chuck 
dived into the ditch, even as he 
felt it prick his coat. 

The kid yelled, “Cock-a-doodle- 
do!” and pedalled on. 

Chuck climbed up out of the 
ditch and ran across the highway. 
Then he straightened his clothing, 
dusted himself off. This was damn 
undignified! He hated the kid, 
wanted to kill him with his bare 
hands. 

He walked along, thinking how 

113 



it had all come about. First it had 
been the highway death toll. When 
it had reached over two thousand 
on week days, and ten thousand on 
weekends, the government had 
stepped in. Their solution had been 
simple and foolproof. They simply 
taxed gas out of sight. Now the oil 
companies exported their total out- 
put, and were making more money 
than ever. 

Then some fool in the A.M.A. 
had pointed out that almost as 
many people were dying of lung 
cancer as had previously fallen on 
the ribbons of death. 

At first Congress had passed a 
bill to ban the manufacture of all 
cigarettes. But the black market 
flourished and the psychiatrists 
yelped. They yelped that the ap- 
proach to the problem was all 
wrong, due to the fact that they 
hadn’t been consulted. This was 
warping personalities and making 
martyrs out of cigarette users. The 
way to do it, they said, was to have 
tobacco products available, but to 
shame people into giving them up 
of their own free wills. 

They theorized that a cigarette 
smoker is really a frustrated person 
unable to cope with the adult 
world. When he puts a cig between 
his lips he is really searching for 
his mother’s nipple. Therefore, the 
thing to do is to force him to out- 
grow this, rather than take it for- 
cibly away from him. Same way 
with a cigar smoker or pipe smoker. 

The psychiatric lobby prevailed 
and the government repealed the 
tobacco bill. And replaced it with 
another. Now it was the law for all 
cigarettes, cigars and pipe to- 

114 


bacco to have an hallucination in- 
ducing drug, Xlene 91, in them. 
Also, as was compulsory, all cigars, 
pipes and cigarettes sported rubber 
filters shaped like nipples. 

Then, Chuck Dane reminisced, 
with lung cancer dropping off 
steadily, they had started in to 
curb heart attacks. And taken away 
the only pleasure a guy had left! 

He was in sight of his place 
of work now. A huge half-circle 
of plexiglass that was Airex Roller 
Skating Factory. Chuck thought as 
he entered the building, that four 
hours was a hell of a long working 
day, especially doing material con- 
trol posting all that time. He hoped 
the bill to change working hours 
to three hours would pass soon. 

A T TWO o’clock in the after- 
Lnoon, Chuck lined up with the 
rest of the office force to walk 
single file past the hidden electronic 
camera. Out of habit, he held his 
right hand in salute position, palm 
toward the camera. These deals 
had been interesting when they 
first replaced the old style time 
clocks, now they were routine. 

As the queue neared the door 
where the company’s three psychi- 
atrists stood, Chuck got more and 
more nervous. Suppose they could 
read his mind, or something! 

Sure enough, Doctor Benton 
wiggled a finger for him to step 
out of line. He took him to one 
side, and peered into his face. 
Chuck tried to look into the green 
eyes, so calm and assured, but he 
had to look away. 

“You okay, Dane?” 

VIRGIL F. SHOCKLEY 



“Sure! Tired, that’s all. Helluva 
long day!” 

“Yes. Well, you come in and 
see me tomorrow. We’ll have us a 
little talk.” 

Rapidly, Chuck left the building. 
He muttered, “Like hell we will, 
Headshrinker!” 

Furtively, he left the usual road 
home, and walked into a corner 
drugstore. He stood around with his 
hands in his pockets, until all the 
other customers cleared out. 

“Puffies,” he said. 

The big man behind the counter 
tried to hitch his belt over his 
paunch. “Sure you know what 
you’re doin’, Bud? Have to take 
your number you know.” 

Chuck didn’t answer. He pulled 
his right hand out of his pocket and 
laid it palm up on the glass counter 
top. The man wrote down the id 
number and handed over the 
cigarettes. 

Chuck walked on home, with the 
Puffies a guilty lump in his jacket 
pocket. He felt sure everybody he 
met knew what he was up to. 

At home, Chuck stuck his head 
in the kitchen and said “Hi” to 
Sally. He resisted patting her. He 
went to the den and locked the 
door with trembling fingers, then 
sat at the desk and took out his 
knife. He cut off the realistic red 
nipples from all twenty cigarettes, 
and made a pyre of them in the 
middle of the glass top. Then he 
set fire to them, not minding the 
acrid smoke. 

He put a cigarette to his lips. 
Still he hesitated, fearing the hal- 
lucinations, about which he had 
heard but never experienced. 

THE DOWNHILL SIDE OF THIRTY 


Suddenly he grinned and leaned 
back, lit up and closed his eyes. 
The parade of pictures began in 
front of his eyeballs. First a picture 
of human lungs, and slowly the 
cancer virus invades them and eats 
them away. Then the parade of 
men and women clutching their 
chests, writhing in death throes. 
Chuck Dane smiled, enjoying each 
hallucination. Pretending that the 
unlucky victims were the Propa- 
gandists. 

He lit another cigarette from 
the butt of the first one, and leaned 
back, feeling his lungs pleasantly 
saturated with smoke. 

When ten cigarettes were snubbed 
in a row on the glass top of 
the desk, he stopped and mused. 
Now, he guessed he would die of 
cancer for sure. He wondered how 
long. 

Then another thought hit him. 
With two temptations, he wondered 
why he had given in to the cigarette 
first. 

He lit another PufEe and leaned 
back in the chair and closed his 
eyes. A perfect technicolor picture 
of Sally crossed his mind, swishing 
the pony tail provocatively. He got 
up. Left the den. Went to the 
kitchen and leaned in the door 
watching her. 

Tomorrow was Tuesday. His day 
for S-Count. But he wouldn’t sub- 
mit to that again. Or have that 
little talk with Doctor Benton. To- 
morrow, going to work, when he 
crossed U.S. 75 he would give some 
Teenager a hell of a thrill! But 
tonight . tonight . 

“Come here, baby!” he whispered 
harshly. END

SCIENCE 




A built-in guidance system for to- 
morrows’ highways was recently 
demonstrated at the General Mo- 
tors Technical Center in Warren, 
Michigan, when an automobile was 
automatically guided along a one- 
mile check road. The combined 
electronic computer and servo 
mechanism, which controlled the 
car, followed a magnetic path pro- 
duced by low frequency power in 
an electrical cable under the high- 
way. 

28.600.000 tons of dust of cosmic 
origin is suspended in the earth’s 
atmosphere below the 60 mile level, 
according to a recent report of Dr. 
Hans Pettersson of the University 
of Hawaii. The dust, fine meteoric 
particles, which continuously sift 
earthward, is renewed every two 
years. This means that the earth is 
picking up 14,300,000 tons a year. 
To this tonnage is added another 

620.000 tons of interplanetary dust 
which the earth collects each year 
in its journey around the sun. Dr. 
Pettersson took his samples by filter- 
ing large volumes of air through 
fine-pored filters at Mauna Loa 
Observatory on Hawaii at 11,000 
feet and at Mt. Haleakala, on 
Maui, T. H., at 10,000 feet. The 
filters were analyzed for iron, co- 


balt and nickel content, and weight 
was estimated from the nickel con- 
tent. Dr. Pettersson advises further 
experiments, as this tonnage is four 
times that of estimates previously 
made. 

The Army Prosthetics Research 
Laboratory has announced a “cos- 
metic glove” to fit the mechanical 
hands of amputees. Complete with 
hair and fingernails, they are so 
lifelike they cannot be distinguished 
at a casual glance from a real hand. 
With today’s mechanical hand de- 
veloped to the point where it can 
be operated with a single cable at 
80% efficiency, scientists at the 
APRL are now working on a sense 
of touch and feel — an extension of 
the nerves into the mechanical 
fingers! 

Cleaner streets with nylon is a pre- 
diction of the DuPont Company. 
Scientific research is responsible for 
the use of nylon bristles, the same 
kind you have in your toothbrush, 
in brooms and brushes to clean the 
nation’s streets. Tests prove that 
brooms with ordinary vegetable 
fibre bristles last 150-200 sweeping 
miles, while nylon-bristled street- 
brooms provide 4000 miles of 
sweeping. Bristles used in test 
brooms were 12 inches long, with a 
useful length of seven inches and 
a diameter the size of an ordinary 
lead pencil. Average wear was 600 
miles to the inch. 

A tiny, 3 Yq inch, 150- watt Tru- 
Flector lamp, smaller than any 
comparable projection lamp, has 
been announced by Sylvania Elec- 


116 


trie. In an eight-millimeter movie 
projector, it provides about the 
same screen brightness as the larger 
500-watt type in wide use today. 
Its chief advantage, aside from 
economy, is that it requires less 
cooling and, consequently, is much 
quieter. 

The Kilowatt Heat Barrier has been 
broken by a Detroit inventor, 
Glenn W. Watson, who has found 
a way to extract 9385 BTU’S from 
the Kilowatt. This is two and three 
quarters times the 80 year old fig- 
ure of 3413 BTU’S. A combination 
of two basic electronic principles 
produces the new heat figure. Elec- 
tronic steam radiator heat in one 
room and a bank of “hot wire” 
heat positioned in another room 
fifty feet away, produces the new 
figure results. The inventor declares 
9385 BTU’S of heat were always 
present in the Kilowatt but man 
did not know how to extract it for 
use. He states that more went to 
waste by the ground wire than was 
utilized. 

A "time clock" for atomic fallout 
has been developed at the Atomic 
Energy Project at University of 
California at Los Angeles. The de- 
vice, which punches its own time 
clock, shows the precise time at 
which fallout arrives in areas up 
to 100 jiles from “ground zero”. 
This information is vital to deter- 
mine the amount of radiation-ex- 
posure people in this area may have 
received. The device operates 
when increased radiation intensity 
reaches a pre-set rate, shorting the 
electrical circuit, blowing a fuse 


and stopping the clock instantly, 
thus showing exact time of fallout 
arrival. Such a device will provide 
accurate data for effective treat- 
ment of victims, particularly in 
cases where time is the determining 
factor. 

Polio shots for all children under 
five is strongly urged by the U. S. 
Department of Health, Education 
and Welfare. According to 1957 
figures, the highest attack rate, 5.7 
per 100,000, was among children 
one year old. The next highest was 
5.5 among two-year olds, and for 
children through four years of age 
the rate was 4.4. For children be- 
tween the ages of 5 and 19 the aver- 
age was 1.4.

Your editorial comments on what 
writers write about are interest- 
ing and somewhat accurate. The 
dream-expression aspect of a story 
shows up especially in fantasy, so 
that theoretically a story of that type 
expresses the conflicts that are in 
the writer, when such conflicts are 
strong at the time of writing. How- 
ever, there is another aspect to con- 
flict — getting conflict into a story 
when the writer isn’t at war with 
something. That is. when the writer 
feels he has to have conflict to sell a 
story. A writer can get in a rut in 
that direction. For example, two 
stories of mine, (Captain Peabody , 
Game Preserve ) have similarities on 
the symbolic level — two major ones, 
to be specific : ( 1 ) a group of peo- 
ple that are the helpless victims and 
(2) one act of extreme cruelty per- 
lormed by an individual from noble 
motivations. In both cases the vic- 
tim was helpless at the time, in 


both cases the person administering 
the cruelty was going against his 
nature. And also, in both cases, it 
was not so much a person that was 
attacked with such all-out swiftness 
and reluctance, but something pres- 
ent in the attacked person. In one it 
was mixed genes that could threaten 
the race, in the other it was a sadism 
that threatened everyone aboard 
ship. In fact, abstractly the two 
stories are so similar that they could 
be said to be significantly sympto- 
matic — except for the fact that they 
were not written at the same time 
nor were they the only stories I 
wrote nor were they the only ones I 
sold. In going over the stories writ- 
ten during that year, they are the 
only two having those qualities. In 
fact, they seem to be the only two 
I’ve ever written having just those 
qualities. But in finding that out 
I’ve also found out that I have a 
most definite repugnance to conflict, 
and a general approach to it of stall- 
ing it off and making it swift, all- 
out, and getting it out of the way 
quickly, like taking medicine. In 
real life I’m the same way. 

I still think Game Preserve one 
of the best stories I ever wrote, and 
very gentle in touch rather than 
sadistic. All those who have written 
to me directly seem to agree. 

In answer to that letter (Febru- 
ary IF) taking task with “one fourth 
of the population would be subnor- 
mal”, the problem would be social 
as well as Mendelian, with so many 
social variables involved that not a 
priori argument from Mendel’s laws 
alone could possibly be correct ex- 
cept by accident. One factor would 
be that very few normals would 

1 18 


marry subnormals. Another would 
be that renegade male normals 
might sire a large percentage of the 
offspring of subnormal females. But 
my “educated guess” that one 
fourth of the population would be- 
come subnormal without the pre- 
serves cannot be disproven, any 
more than it can be proven, from 
any knowledge we possess today.

Fascinating language, Interlin- 
gua — sounds like a kind of scram- 
ble of the “Romance” Languages. 
Would certainly like more informa- 
tion. Origin of the language, etc. — 
and, since I live in Mexico, I would 
be grateful for the addresses of 
stateside publishers of textbooks, if 
any, on the subject. 

While we’re about it, let me say 
that, yes, IF is a good magazine. 
Nice that you publish “unknowns” 
like Miguel Hidalgo. Too many 
science fiction magazines rely pure- 
ly on established names, and while 
this is all well and good, even the 
best writers flub sometimes. Isn’t it 
better to print something fresh by 
an “unknown” than a mediocre 
effort by a “name”? Incidentally, 
there seems to be a prevalence of 
science fiction titles down here. 
Maybe because there are so many 


“escapees” in Mexico. 

— Jeanne Malone 
Mexico, D. F. 

You were absolutely right about 
Miguel Hidalgo. His story wasn’t 
the best in the issue, but it was 
certainly a very fine story, and I 
hope the sale will inspire Miguel to 
write more stories. I hope I will be 
able to write that well when I am 
fifteen. 

You weren’t as absolutely right 
about A Question of Identity 
(April ’58). I’m fairly sure that a 
more original story will come along 
during 1958. The idea of establish- 
ing what a man is was used (with 
a different twist — the missing link 
is found and no one knows whether 
to call them men or apes) in You 
Shall Know Them. The idea of re- 
building men has also been often 
used before. The originality of this 
story lies in the combination of 
ideas. The rest of the stories were 
also more or less lacking in orig- 
inality, but they were all good. IF 
seems to be typed; in this issue five 
of seven stories dealt with extra- 
polated societies or extraterrestrial 
societies. If you must buy typed 
stories, why don’t you spread them? 

The new IF logo is much better.

In the February ’58 issue of IF, 
Ike Asimov wrote a good, humor- 
ous story. I thoroughly enjoyed it. 
However, he overlooks some things, 
probably on purpose; mainly that 
computors work many times faster 
than the human mind and with no 
possibility of mistakes (other than 
the human feeding wrong informa- 
tion into it). 

In the story, they talked about 
breaking through on the “square 
root front”, but the farthest a man 
(without a computer) has gone 
with the irrational square root of 
two is in the hundreds, while a 
computor has had it out in the 
thousands, without much human 
strain, and in a much shorter peri- 
od of time! 

Another thing in the story was 
the development of a manned mis- 
sile to fight against a computor- 
controlled missile. It isn’t practical 
because of the slow reaction time of 
humans compared to computors. 
The only way manned missiles 
could destroy one would be through 
overwhelming numbers. But then 
the loss of ships would nullify most 
of the advantage of getting five 
times as many and at one-tenth of 
the cost of the compu tor-manned 
missiles.

t; . 

When is scien' e fiction not sci- 
ence fiction? When it’s an historical 
novel of the future. 

When is a science fiction story 
a bore? When a present-day dilem- 
ma (war, degression, bad television, 
book-burning) is propelled into 
the defenseless future, and then 


solved in a manner suitable to the 
author. 

Is science fiction about science or 
is it just about tomorrowland? And 
if it’s about tomorrowland, why, 
groan, can’t we give tomorrowland 
another batch of troubles? Can’t 
we assume that a lot of our trou- 
bles (inflation, Fuller Brush men, 
California tailpipes) will, like the 
snows of yesteryear, just fade away? 
Does shoving the clock ahead a 
couple of hundred years make a 
story a science fiction story? And 
why, oh, why, does the hero of the 
story always stop to reflect how 
much things have improved/de- 
teriorated since the middle of the 
twentieth century? Why doesn’t he 
think, just once, about the nine- 
teenth century? Or the twenty- 
first? What is so uniquely interest- 
ing about the 1950s that all the 
people of the future hark back on 
it with nostalgia/horror? 

The crux of a science fiction 
story, a real one, will always be a 
valid idea about science. Be it 
gadgets, be it medicine, be it so- 
ciology, be it economics, be it space 
travel, be it teleportation, time trav- 
el, or whatever. An adventure story 
without a new concept of some 
facet of science is not a science fic- 
tion story. So what if the action 
takes place on an unheard-of plan- 
et? Who cares if a man of con- 
science declaims Tom Paine on an 
unheard-of planet? We recognize 
all the old faces.

-...AND WAKING UP 30 YEARS YOUNGCR 
THAN YOUK SWEETHEART! 


J UST put yourself in Daniel Davis’ 
place. It’s the year 1970. You’re a 
young engineer, about to sell a million- 
dollar invention. You’re sitting pretty— 
until your passionate friend. Belle Dar- 
kin, upsets your apple cart. First she 
steals your invention. Then she slips you 
a hypo; puts you in a new kind of deep 
freeze called “The Long Sleep.” 

You wake up 30 YEARS LATER , in 
the year 2000— and you’re still only 29 
years old! But time has passed 
while you were in “cold storage,” 
and Belle, your ccc-sweetheart, is 
now 30 years older than you are ! 

Well, you’ve lost interest in her 
anyway, after the way she two- 
timed and future-timed you. 


The Fascinating World of 2000 4.D. 

But there are other attractions 
in that world of 2000 : its women 
in “sticktite” clothes they just 
throw away after wearing ... its 
honeymoon trips to the moon... 
its remarkable new conveniences 
...its brand new words of love 
and ways to live. No more menial 
labor. Robots take care of all that. 
Soon you’re enjoying life as never 
before! You’re glad to be out of 
that miserably backward world 
of the 20th century. 

But unfortunately you must get 
back to the year 1970, to take 
care of one last urgent mission. 
You only hope that you can come 
back to the 21st century by tak- 
ing “The Long Sleep” again. The 
big question is: Can it be done?
