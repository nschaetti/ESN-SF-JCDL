THE BUSINESS OF SCIENCE 



Hphe New York Academy of 
Sciences, which will be hav- 
ing its sesquicentennial anniver- 
sary next year, hopes to cele- 
brate it in an unusual, but we 
think appropriate way. Its plan 
is to add another skyscraper to 
New York City’s skyline, a 30- 
story World Science Center in 
the Lincoln Center complex 
which will, as the name suggests, 
provide office space, meeting fa- 
cilities and other necessary ser- 
vices for what is rapidly becom- 
ing the world’s number one in- 
dustry : Science. 

To us this seems like a very 
good thing indeed. Time was 
when big office buildings were 
put up by a very few classes of 
enterprises. In the small towns 
of America the buildings that 
stood out across the circling 
farms were the telephone com- 
pany’s, or the local power com- 
pany’s, and just about nothing 
else. The towers that dominated 
the cities were ordinarily put up 
by banks or insurance companies 
— principally as a way of invest- 
ing their funds. More recently it 
became common for big business 
to construct big buildings to 
house their headquarters — pub- 



lications like Time-Life or major 
newspapers, retail chains, indus- 
trial concerns and so on. 

But the World Science Center 
is something else. The only near 
comparison we can thing of is 
Technology Tower, an adjunct of 
M.I.T. that dominates Cam- 
bridge, Massachusetts; yet a 
large proportion of Tech Tower 
is given over to commercial en- 
terprises, while the World 
Science Center, even bigger, is 
going to be simon-pure. It will be 
for science and nothing else. 

It seems to us that we have to 
go back earlier than the build- 
ing boom of this century to find 
an analogy to the World Science 
Center, all the way back to the 
great cathedral builders of the 
Renaissance and the Middle 
Ages. This too is a “sermon in 
stone”; it is an embodiment of 
a change in ways of life, a new 
kind of orientation for human 
thought. 

We wish the New York Aca- 
demy of Sciences well with their 
project and their 150th anniver- 
sary — and we await with ex- 
citement and anticipation what 
they may plan for their 200th!

men had never experienced. 
There were girls who fell in 
love with such men, however 
stark and dreadful their personal 
fates might be. There was the 
Instrumentality, with its unceas- 
ing labor to keep man man. And 
there were the citizens who walk- 
ed in the boulevards before the 
Rediscovery of Man. The citizens 
were happy. They had to be 
happy. If they were found sad, 
they were calmed and drugged 
and changed until they were 
happy again. 

This story concerns three of 
them: the gambler who took the 
name Sun-boy, who dared to go 
down to the Gebiet, who con- 
fronted himself before he died; 
the girl Santuna, who was ful- 
filled in a thousand ways before 
she died; and the Lord Sto Odin, 
a most ancient of days, who 
knew it all and never dreamed 
of preventing any of it. 

Music runs through this story. 
The soft sweet music of the 
Earth Government and the In- 
strumentality, bland as honey 
and sickening in the end. The 
wild illegal pulsations of the 
Gebiet, where most men were 
forbidden to enter. Worst of all, 
the crazy fugues and improper 
melodies of the Bezirk, closed 
to men for fifty-seven centuries 
— opened by accident, found, 
trespassed in! And with it our 
story begins. 

8 



r T~'he Lady Ru had said, a few 
-*■ centuries before: “Scraps 

of knowledge have been found. 
In the ultimate beginning of 
man, even before there were air- 
craft, the wise man Laodz de- 
clared, ‘Water does nothing but 
it penetrates everything. Inac- 
tion finds the road.’ Later an 
ancient lord said this: “There is 
a music which underlies all 
things. We dance to the tunes 
all our lives, though our living 
ears never hear the music which 
guides us and moves us. Happi- 
ness can kill people as softly as 
shadows seen in dreams.’ We 
must be people first and happy 
later, lest we live and die in 
vain.” 

The Lord Sto Odin was more 
direct. He declared the truth to 
a few private friends: “Our 

population is dropping on most 
worlds, including the earth. Peo- 
ple have children, but they don’t 
want them very much. I myself 
have been a three-father to 
twelve children, a two-father to 
four, and a one-father, I suppose, 
to many others. I have had zeal 
for work and I have mistaken 
it for zeal in living. They are 
not the same. 

“Most people want happiness. 
Good: we have given them hap- 
piness. 

“Dreary useless centuries of 

GALAXY 



happiness, in which all the un- 
happy were corrected or adjust- 
ed or killed. Unbearable desolate 
happiness without the sting of 
grief, the wine of rage, the hot 
fumes of fear. How many of us 
have ever tasted the acid, icy 
taste of old resentment? That’s 
what people really lived for in 
the Ancient Days, when they 
pretended to be happy and were 
actually alive with grief, rage, 
fury, hate, malice and hope! 
Those people bred like mad. 
They populated the stars while 
they dreamed of killing each 
other, secretly or openly. Their 
plays concerned murder or be- 
trayal or illegal love. Now we 
have no murder. We cannot 
imagine any kind of love which 
is illegal. Can you imagine the 
Murkins with their highway 
net? Who can fly anywhere to- 
day without seeing that net of 
enormous highways? Those 
roads are rained, but they’re 
still here. You can see the abom- 
inable things quite clearly from 
the moon. Don’t think about the 
roads. Think of the millions of 
vehicles that ran on those roads, 
the people filled with greed and 
rage and hate, rushing past each 
other with their engines on 
fire. They say that fifty thou- 
sand a year were killed on the 
roads alone. We would call that 
a war. What people they must 
have been, to rush day and night 



and to build things which would 
help other people to rush even 
more! They were different from 
us. They must have been wild, 
dirty, free. Lusting for life, per- 
haps, in a way that we do not. 
We can easily go a thousand 
times faster than they ever went, 
but who, nowadays, bothers to 
go? Why go? It’s the same 
there as here, except for a few 
fighters or technicians.” lie 
smiled at his friends and added, 
“. and Lords of the Instru- 
mentality, like ourselves. We 50 
for the reasons of the Instru- 
mentality. Not ordinary people 
reasons. Ordinary people don’t 
have much reason to do any- 
thing. They work at the jobs 
which we think up for them, to 
keep them happy while the ro- 
bots and the underpeople do the 
real work. They walk. They 
make love. But they are never 
unhappy. 

“They can’t bet” 

The Lady Mmooa disagreed, 
“Life can’t be as bad as you say. 
We don’t just think they are 
happy. We know they are hap- 
py. We look right into their 
brains with telepathy. We mon- 
itor their emotional patterns 
with robots and scanners. It’s not 
as though we didn’t have sam- 
ples. People are always turning 
unhappy. We’re correcting them 
all the time. And now and then 
there are bad accidents, which 



UNDER OLD EARTH 



♦ 



even we cannot correct. When 
people are very unhappy, they 
scream and weep. Sometimes they 
even stop talking and just die, 
despite everything we can do for 
them. You can’t say that isn’t 
real!” 

‘‘But I do,” said the Lord Sto 
Odin. 

‘‘You do what?” cried Mmona. 

“I do say this happiness is not 
real,” he insisted. 

“How can you,” she shouted 
at him, “in the face of the evi- 
dence? Out evidence, which we 
of the Instrumentality decided 
on a long time ago. We collect 
it ourselves. Can we. the Instru- 
mentality, be wrong?” 

“Yes,” said the Lord Sto Odin. 

'"T~'his time it was the entire 
circle who went silent. 

Sto Odin pleaded with them. 
“Look at my evidence. People 
don’t care whether they are one- 
fathers or one-mothers or not. 
They don’t know which children 
are theirs, anyhow. Nobody 
dares to commit suicide. We 
keep them too happy. But do 
we spend any time keeping the 
talking animals, the underpeo- 
ple. as happy as men? And do 
underpeople commit suicide?” 

“Certainly,” said Mmona. 
“They are preconditioned to 
commit suicide if they are hurt 
too badly for easy repair or if 
they fail in their appointed work.” 



“I don’t mean that. Do they 
ever commit suicide for their 
reasons, not ours?” 

“No,” said the Lord Nuru-or, 
a wise young Lord of the Instru- 
mentality. “They are too des- 
perately busy doing their jobs 
and staying alive.” 

“How long does an underper- 
son live?” said Sto Odin, with 
deceptive mildness. 

“Who knows?” said Nuru-or. 
“Half a year, a hundred years, 
maybe several hundred years.” 
“What happens if he does not 
work?” said the Lord Sto Odin, 
with a friendly-crafty smile. 

“We kill him,” said Mmona, 
“or our robot-police do.” 

“And does the animal know 
it?” 

“Know he will be killed if he 
does not work?” said Mmona. 
“Of course. We tell all of them 
the same thing. Work or die. 
What’s that got to do with peo- 
ple?” 

The Lord Nuru-or had fallen 
silent and a wise, sad smile had 
begun to show on his face. He 
had begun to suspect the shrewd, 
dreadful conclusion toward 
which the Lord Sto Odin was 
driving. 

But Mmona did not see it and 
she pressed the point. “My 
lord,” said she, “you are insist- 
ing that people are happy. You 
admit they do not like to be 
unhappy. You seem to want to 



10 



GALAXY 



bring up a problem which has 
no solution. Why complain of 
happiness? Isn’t it the best 
which the Instrumentality can 
do for mankind? That’s our 
mission. Are you saying that we 
are failing in it?” 

“Yes. We are failing.” The 
Lord Sto Odin looked blindly 
at the room as though alone. 

He was the oldest and wisest, 
so they waited for him to talk. 

He breathed lightly and 
smiled at them again. “You know 
when I am going to die?” 

“Of course,” said Mmona, 
thinking for half a second. “Sev- 
enty-seven days from now. But 
you posted the time yourself. 
And it is not our custom, my 
Lord, as you well know, to bring 
intimate things into meetings of 
the Instrumentality.” 

“Sorry,” said Sto Odin, “but 
I’m not violating a law. I’m 
making a point. We are sworn 
to uphold the dignity of man. 
Yet we are killing mankind with 
a bland hopeless happiness 
which has prohibited news, 
which has suppressed religion, 
which has made all history an 
official secret. I say that the 
evidence is that we are failing 
and that mankind, whom we’ve 
sworn to cherish, is failing too. 
Failing in vitality, strength, 
numbers, energy. I have a little 
while to live. I am going to try 
to find out.” 



The Lord Nuru-or asked with 
sorrowful wisdom, as though he 
guessed the answer : “And where 
will you go to find out?” 

“I shall go,” said the Lord 
Sto Odin, “down into the Gebi- 
et.” 

Ct'Hphe Gebiet — oh, no!” cried 
several. And one voice 
added, “You’re immune.” 

“I shall waive immunity and 
I shall go,” said the Lord Sto 
Odin. “Who can do anything to 
a man who is already almost a 
thousand years old and who has 
chosen only seventy-seven more 
days to live?” 

“But you can’t!” said Mmona. 
“Some criminal might capture 
you and duplicate you, and then 
we would all of us be in peril.” 
“When did you last hear of 
a criminal among mankind?” 
said Sto Odin. 

“There are plenty of them, 
here and there in the offworlds.” 
“But on Old Earth itself?” 
asked Sto Odin. 

She stammered. “I don’t know. 
There must have been a crimi- 
nal once.” She looked around 
the room. “Don’t any of the rest 
of you know?” 

There was silence. 

The Lord Sto Odin stared at 
them all. In his eyes was the 
brightness and fierceness which 
had made whole generations of 
Lords plead with him to live 



UNDER OLD EARTH 



11 



just a few more years, so that 
he could help them with their 
work. He had agreed, but within 
the last quarter-year he had 
overridden them all and had 
picked his day of death. He had 
lost none of his powers in doing 
this. They shrank from his stare 
while they waited with respect 
for his decision. 

The Lord Sto Odin looked at 
the Lord Nuru-or and said, “I 
think you have guessed what I 
am going to do in the Gebiet 
and why I have to go there.” 

“The Gebiet is a preserve 
where no rules apply and no 
punishments are inflicted. Ordi- 
nary people can do What they 
want down there, not what we 
think they should want. From 
all I hear, it is pretty nasty and 
pointless, the things that they 
find out. But you, perhaps, may 
sense the inwardness of these 
things. You may find a cure for 
the weary happiness of man- 
kind.” 

“That is right,” said Sto Odin. 
“And that is why I am going, 
after I make the appropriate 
official preparations.” 

Ill 

f^o he did. He used one of 
^ ' the most peculiar convey- 
ances ever seen on Earth, since 
his own legs were too weak to 
carry him far. With only two- 



ninths of a year to live, he did 
not want to waste time getting 
his legs re-grafted. 

He rode in an open sedan- 
chair carried by two Roman 
legionaries. 

The legionaries were actually 
robots, without a trace of blood 
or living tissue in them. They 
were the most compact and dif- 
ficult kind to create, since their 
brains had to be located in 
their chests — several million 
sheets of incredibly fine lamina- 
tions, imprinted with the whole 
life experience of an important, 
useful and long-dead person. 
They were clothed as legionar- 
ies, down to cuirasses, swords, 
kilts, greaves, sandals and 
shields, merely because It was 
the whim of the Lord Sto Odin 
to go behind the rim of history 
for his companions. Their bod- 
ies, all-metal, were very strong. 
They could batter walls, jump 
chasms, crush any man or under- 
person with their mere fingers, 
or throw their swords with the 
accuracy of guided projectiles. 

The forward legionary, Flavi- 
us, had been Head of Fourteen- 
B in the Instrumentality — an 
espionage division so secret that 
even among Lords, few knew 
exactly of its location or its 
function. He was (or had been, 
till he was imprinted on a robot- 
mind as he lay dying) the di- 
rector of historical research for 



12 



GALAXY 



the whole human race. Now he 
was a dull, pleasant machine 
carrying two poles until his 
master chose to bring his power- 
ful mind into bright, furious 
alert by speaking the simple 
Latin phrase, understood by no 
other person living, Summa nul- 
la est. 

The rear legionary, Livius. 
had been a psychiatrist who 
turned into a general. He had 
won many battles until he chose 
to die, somewhat before his time, 
because he perceived that battle 
itself was a struggle for the de- 
feat of himself. 

Together, and added to the 
immense brainpower of the Lord 
Sto Odin himself, they repre- 
sented an unsurpassable team. 

“The Gebiet,” commanded the 
Lord Sto Odin. 

“The Gebiet,” said both of 
them heavily, picking up the 
chair with its supporting poles. 

“And then the Bezirk,” he 
added. 

“The Bezirk,” they chimed in 
toneless voices. 

Sto Odin felt his chair tilt 
back as Livius put his two ends 
of the poles carefully on the 
ground, came up beside Sto 
Odin and saluted with open 
palm. 

“May I awaken?” said Livius 
in an even, mechanical voice. 

“Summa nulla est,” said the 
Lord Sto Odin. 



I ivius’ face sprang into full 
animation. “You must not 
go there, my Lord! You would 
have to waive immunity and 
meet all dangers. There is noth- 
ing there yet. Not yet. Some day 
they will come pouring out of 
that underground Hades and 
give you men a real fight. Now, 
no. They are just miserable be- 
ings, cooking away in their 
weird unhappiness, making love 
in manners which you never 
thought of — ” 

“Never mind what you think 
I’ve thought. What’s your objec- 
tion in real terms?” 

“It’s pointless, my lord! You 
have only bits of a year to live. 
Do something noble and great 
for man before you die. They 
may turn us off. We would like 
to share your work before you 
go away.” 

“Is that all?” said Sto Odin. 
“My Lord,” said Flavius, “you 
have awakened me too. I say, 
go forward. History is being re- 
spun down there. Things are 
loose which you great ones of 
the Instrumentality have never 
even suspected. Go now and 
look, before you die. You may 
do nothing, but I disagree with 
my companion. It is as danger- 
ous as space-three might be, if 
we ever were to find it, but it 
is interesting. And in this world, 
where all things have been done, 
where all thoughts have been 



UNDER OtD EARTH 



13 



thought, it is hard to find things 
which still prompt the human 
mind with raw curiosity. I’m 
dead, as you perfectly well know, 
but even I, inside this machine 
brain, feel the tug of adventure, 
the pull of danger, the magne- 
tism of the unknown. For one 
thing, they are committing 
crimes down there. And you 
Lords are over-looking them.” 

“We chose to overlook them. 
We are not stupid. We wanted 
to see what might happen,” said 
the Lord Sto Odin, “and we have 
to give those people time before 
we find out just how far they 
might go if they are cut off 
from controls.” 

“They are having babies!” 
said Flavius excitedly. 

“I know that.” 

“They have hooked in two 
illegal instant - message ma- 
chines,” shouted Falvius. 

Sto Odin was calm. “So that’s 
why the Earth’s credit structure 
has appeared to be leaking in 
it«3 balance of trade.” 

“They have a piece of the 
congohelium!” shouted Flavius. 

“The congohelium!” shouted 
the Lord Sto Odin. “Impossible! 
It’s unstable. They could kill 
themselves. They could hurt 
Earth! What are they doing 
with it?” 

“Making music,” said Flavius, 
more quietly. 

“Making what ?” 



“Music. Songs. Nice noise to 
dance to.” 

The Lord Sto Odin sputtered, 
“Take me there right now. This 
is ridiculous. Having a piece of 
the congohelium down there is 
as bad as wiping out inhabited 
planets to play checkers.” 

“My Lord,” said Livius. 

“Yes?” said Sto Odin. 

“I withdraw my objections,” 
said Livius. 

Sto Odin said, very drily, 
“Thank you.” 

“They have something else 
down there. When I did not want 
you to go, I did not mention it. 
It might have aroused your curi- 
osity. They have a god.” 

Hphe Lord Sto Odin said, “If 
this is going to be a histori- 
cal lecture, save it for another 
time. Go back to sleep and carry 
me down.” 

Livius did not move. “I mean 
what I said.” 

“A god? What do you call a 
god?” 

“A person or an idea capable 
of starting wholly new cultural 
patterns in motion.” 

The Lord Sto Odin leaned for- 
ward, “You know this?” 

“We both do,” said Flavius 
and Livius. 

“We saw him,” said Livius. 
“You told us, a tenth-year ago, 
to walk around freely for thirty 
hours, so we put on ordinary

robot bodies and happened to 
get into the Gebiet. When we 
sensed the congohelium operat- 
ing, we had to go on down to 
find out what it was doing. 
Usually, it is employed to keep 
the stars in their place — ” 
“Don’t tell me that. I know 
it. Was it a man?” 

“A man,” said Flavius, “who 
is re-living the life of 
Akhnaton.” 

“Who’s that?” said the Lord 
Sto Odin, who knew history, 
but wanted to see how much his 
robots knew. 

“A king, tall, long-faced, 
thick lipped, who ruled the hu- 
man world of Egypt long-long 
before atomic power. Akhnaton 
invented the best of the early 
gods. This man is reenacting 
Akhnaton’s life step by step. He 
has already made a religion out 
of the sun. He mocks at happi- 
ness. People listen to him. They 
joke about the Instrumentality.” 
Livius added, “We saw the 
girl who loves him. She herself 
was young, but beautiful. And I 
think she has powers which will 
make the Instrumentality pro- 
mote her or destroy her some 
day in the future.” 

“They both made music,” said 
Flavius, “with that piece of the 
congohelium. And this man or 
god — this new kind of Akhna- 
ton, whatever you may want to 
call him, my Lord — he was 



dancing a strange kind of dance. 
It was like a corpse being tied 
with rope and dancing like a 
marionette. The effect on the 
people around him was as good 
as the best hypnotism you ever 
saw. I’m a robot now, but it 
bothered even me.” 

“Did the dance have a name?” 
said Sto Odin. 

“I don’t know the name,” said 
Flavius, “but I memorized the 
song, since I have total recall. 
Do you wish to hear it?” 

“Certainly,” said the Lord Sto 
Odin. 

Flavius stood on one leg, 
improbable angles and began to 
sing in a high, insulting tenor 
voice which was both fascinat- 
ing and repugnant: 

Jump, dear people, and I'll howl for you. 

Jump and howl and Til weep for you. 

I weep because I'm a weeping man. 
I'm a weeping man because I weep. 

I weep because *he day is done. 

Sun is gone. 

Home is lost. 

Time hilled dad. 

I killed time. 

World is round. 

Day is run. 

Clouds are shot. 

Stars are out. 

Mountain's fire. 

Rain is hot, 

Hot is blue. 

I am done. _ 

So are you. 

Jump, dear people, for the howling man. 

Leap, dear people, for the weeping man. 

I'm a weeping man because I weep 
for you! 



UNDER OLD EARTH

“Enough,” said the Lord Sto 
Odin. 

Flavius saluted. His face went 
back to amiable stolidity. Just 
before he took the front ends of 
the shaft he glanced back and 
brought forth one last comment: 

“The verse is skeltonic.” 

“Tell me nothing more of your 
history. Take me there.” 

‘'nr'he robots obeyed. Soon the 
chair was jogging comfort- 
ably down the ramps of the 
ancient left-over city which 
sprawled beneath Earthport, 
that miraculous tower which 
seemed to touch the stratocumu- 
lus clouds in the blue clear 
nothingness above mankind. Sto 
Odin went to sleep in his strange 
vehicle and did not notice that 
the human passers-by often 
stared at him. 

The Lord Sto Odin woke fit- 
fully in strange places as the 
legionaries carried him further 
and further into the depths be- 
low the city, where sweet pres- 
sures and warm, sick smells 
made the air itself feel dirty to 
his nose. 

“Stop!” whispered the Lord 
Sto Odin, and the robots stopped. 

“Who am I?” he said to them. 

“You have announced your 
will to die, my Lord,” said Flavi- 
us, “seventy-seven days from 
now, but so far your name is 
still the Lord Sto Odin.” 



“I am alive?” the Lord asked. 

“Yes,” said both the robots. 

“You are dead?” 

“We are not dead. We are 
machines, printed with the 
minds of men who once lived. 
Do you wish to turn back, my 
lord?” 

“No. No. Now I remember. 
You are the robots. Livius, the 
psychiatrist and general. Flavius, 
the secret historian. You have 
the minds of men, and are not 
men?” 

“That is right, my Lord,” said 
Flavius. 

“Then how can I be alive — 
I, Sto Odin?” 

“You should feel it yourself, 
sir,” said Livius, “though the 
mind of the old is sometimes 
very strange.” 

“How can I be alive?” asked 
Sto Odin, staring around the 
city. “How can I be alive when 
the people who knew me are 
dead? They have whipped 
through the corridors like 
wraiths of smoke, like traces of 
cloud; they were here, and they 
loved me, and they knew me, 
and now they are dead. Take my 
wife, Eileen. She was a pretty 
thing, a brown-eyed child who 
came out of her learning cham- 
ber all perfect and all young. 
Time touched her and she danced 
to the cadence of time. Her body 
grew full, grew old. We repaired 
it. But at last she cramped in 



16 



GALAXY 



death and she went to that place 
to which I am going. If you are 
dead, you ought to be able to 
tell me what death is like, where 
the bodies and minds and voices 
and music of men and women 
whip past these enormous corri- 
dors, these hardy pavements, and 
are then gone. How can pass- 
ing ghosts like me and my kind, 
each with just a few dozen or a 
few hundred years to go before 
the great blind winds of time 
whip us away — how can phan- 
toms like me have built this 
solid city, these wonderful en- 
gines, these brilliant lights 
which never go dim? How did 
we do it, when we pass so swift- 
ly, each of us, all of us? Do 
you know?” 

'Tphe robots did not answer. 

Pity had not been pro- 
grammed into their systems. The 
Lord Sto Odin harangued them, 
none the less : 

“You are taking me to a wild 
place, a free place, an evil place, 
perhaps. They are dying there 
too, as all men die, as I shall 
die, so soon, so brightly and 
simply. I should have died a 
long time ago. I was the people 
who knew me, I was the brothers 
and comrades who trusted me, 
I was the women who comforted 
me, I was the children whom I 
loved so bitterly and so sweetly 
many ages ago. Now they are 



gone. Time touched them, and 
they were not. I can see every- 
one that I ever knew racing 
through these corridors, see 
them young as toddlers, see them 
proud and wise and full with 
business and maturity, see them 
old and contorted as time reach- 
ed out for them and they passed 
hastily away. Why did they do 
it? How can I live on? When 
I am dead, will I know that I 
once lived? I know that some 
of my friends have cheated and 
lie in the icy sleep, hoping for 
something which they do not 
know. I’ve had life, and I know 
it. What is life? A bit of play, 
a bit of learning, some words 
well-chosen, some love, a trace 
of pain, more work, memories, 
and then dirt rushing up to 
meet sunlight. That’s all we’ve 
made of it — we, who have con- 
quered the stars! Where are my 
friends? Where is my me that 
I once was so sure of, when 
the people who knew me were 
time- swept like storm -driven 
rags toward darkness and ob- 
livion? You tell me. You ought 
to know! You are machines and 
you were given the minds of 
men. You ought to know what 
we amount to, from the outside 
in.” 

“We were built,” said Livius, 
“by men and we have whatever 
men put into us, nothing more. 
How can we answer talk like 



UNDER OtD EARTH 



17 



yours? It is rejected by our 
minds, good though our minds 
may be. We have no grief, no 
fear, no fury. We know the 
names of these feelings but not 
the feelings themselves. We hear 
your words but we do not know 
what you are talking about. Are 
you trying to tell us what life 
feels like? If so, we already 
know. Not much. Nothing spe- 
cial. Birds have life too, and so 
do fishes. It is you people who 
can talk and who can knot life 
into spasms and puzzles. You 
muss things up. Screaming never 
made the truth truthful, at least, 
not to us.” 

“Take me down,” said Sto 
Odin. “Take me down to the 
Gebiet, where no well-mannered 
man has gone in many years. I 
am going to judge that place 
before I die.” 

They lifted the sedan-chair 
and resumed their gentle dog- 
trot down the immense ramps 
down toward the warm steaming 
secrets of the Earth itself. The 
human pedestrians became more 
scarce, but undermen — most 
often of gorilla or ape origin — 
passed them, toiling their way 
upward while dragging shroud- 
ed treasures which they had 
filched the uncatalogued store- 
houses of Man’s most ancient 
past. At other times there was 
a wild whirr of metal wheels on 
stone roadway; the undermen, 

18 



having offloaded their treasures 
at some intermediate point high 
above, sat on their wagons and 
rolled back downhill, like gro- 
tesque enlargements of the an- 
cient human children who were 
once reported to have played 
with wagons in this way. 

A command, scarcely a whis- 
per, stopped the two legionaries 
again. Flavius turned. Sto Odin 
was indeed calling both of them. 
They stepped out of the shafts 
and came around to him, one on 
each side. 

“I may be dying right now,” 
he whispered, “and that would 
be most inconvenient at this 
time. Get out my manikin 
meee!” 

“My Lord,” said Flavius, “it is 
strictly forbidden for us robots 
to touch any human manikin, 
and if we do touch one, we are 
commanded to destroy ourselves 
immediately thereafter? Do you 
wish us to try, nevertheless? If 
so, which one of us? You have 
the command, my Lord.” 

IV 

TTe waited so long that even 
the robots began to wonder 
if he died amid the thick wet 
air and the nearby stench of 
steam and oil. 

The Lord Sto Odin finally 
roused himself and said: 

“I need no help. Just put the 

GALAXY 



bag with my manikin meee on 
my lap.” 

“This one?” asked Flavius, 
lifting a small brown suitcase 
and handling it with a very gin- 
gerly touch indeed. 

The Lord Sto Odin gave a 
barely perceptible nod and whis- 
pered, “Open it carefully for 
me. But do not touch the mani- 
kin, if those are your orders.” 

Flavius twisted at the catch of 
the bag. It was hard to manage. 
Robots did not feel fear, but 
they were intellectually attuned 
to the avoidance of danger; Fla- 
vius found his mind racing with 
wild choices as he tried to get 
the bag open. Sto Odin tried to 
help him, but the ancient hand, 
palsied and weak, could not even 
reach the top of the case. Flavius 
labored on, thinking that the 
Gebiet and Bezirk had their 
dangers, but that this meddling 
with manikins was the riskiest 
thing which he had ever en- 
countered while in robot form, 
though in his human life he had 
handled many of them, includ- 
ing his own. They were “Mani- 
kin, Electro-encephalographic 
and endocrine” in model form, 
and they showed in miniaturized 
replica the entire diagnostic po- 
sition of the patient for whom 
they were fashioned. 

Sto Odin whispered to them. 
“There’s no helping it. Turn me 
up. If I die, take my body back 



and tell the people that I mis- 
judged my time.” 

Just as he spoke, the case 
sprang open. Inside it there lay 
a little naked human man, a 
direct copy of Sto Odin himself. 

“We have it, my Lord,” cried 
Livius, from the other side. “Let 
me guide your hand to it, so 
that you can see what to do.” 
Though it was forbidden for 
robots to touch manikins meee, 
it was legal for them to touch 
a human person with the per- 
son’s consent. Livius’s strong 
cupro-plastic fingers, with a re- 
serve of many tons of gripping 
power in their human-like de- 
sign, pulled the hands of the 
Lord Sto Odin forward until 
they rested on the manikin 
meee. Flavius, quick, smooth, 
agile, held the Lord’s head up- 
right on his weary old neck, so 
that the ancient Lord could see 
what the hands were doing. 

“Is any part dead?” said the 
old Lord to the manikin, his 
voice clearer for the moment. 

The manikin shimmered and 
two spots of solid black showed 
along the outside upper right 
thigh and the right buttock. 

“Organic reserve?” said the 
Lord to his own manikin meee, 
and again the machine respond- 
ed to his command. The whole 
miniature body shimmed to a 
violent purple and then sub- 
sided to an even pink. 



UNDER OLD EARTH

"I still have some all-around 
strength left in this body, pros- 
thetics and all,” said Sto Odin 
to the two robots. “Set me up, 
I tell you! Set me up.” 

U 4 re you sure, my Lord,” 
said Livius, “that we 
should do a thing like that here 
where the three of us are alone 
in a deep tunnel? In less than 
half an hour we could take you 
to a real hospital, where actual 
doctors could examine you.” 

“I said,” repeated the Lord 
Sto Odin, “set me up. I’ll watch 
the manikin while you do it.” 
“Your control is in the usual 
place, my Lord?” asked Livius. 

“How much of a turn?” asked 
Flavius. 

“Nape of my neck, of course. 
The skin over it is artificial and 
self-sealing. One twelfth of a 
turn will be enough. Do you 
have a knife with you?” 
Flavius nodded. He took a 
small sharp knife from his belt, 
probed gently around the old 
Lord’s neck and then brought 
the knife down with a quick, 
sure turn. 

“That did it!” said Sto Odin, 
in a voice so hearty that both 
of them stepped back a little. 
Flavius put the knife back in 
his belt. Sto Odin, who had al- 
most been comatose a moment 
before, now held the manikin 
meee in his unaided hands. “See, 



gentlemen!” he cried. “You may 
be robots, but you can still see 
the truth and report it.” 

They both looked at the mani- 
kin meee, which Sto Odin now 
held in front of himself, his 
thumb and fingertip in the 
armpits of the medical doll. 

“Watch what it reads,” he said 
to them with a clear, ringing 
voice. 

“Prosthetics!” he shouted at 
the manikin. 

The tiny body changed from 
its pink color to a mixture. Both 
legs turned the color of a deep 
bruised blue. The legs, the left 
arm, one eye, one ear and the 
skull-cap stayed blue, showing 
the prostheses in place. 

“Felt pain!” shouted Sto Odin 
at the manikin. The little doll 
returned to its light pink color. 
All the details were there, even 
to genitals, toenails and eyelash- 
es. There was no trace of the 
black color of pain in any part 
of the little body. 

“Potential pain!” shouted Sto 
Odin. The doll shimmered. Most 
of it settled to the color of dark 
walnut wood, with some areas of 
intense brown showing more 
clearly than the rest. 

“Potential breakdown — one 
day!” shouted Sto Odin. The 
little body went back to its nor- 
mal color of pink. Small light- 
nings showed at the base of the 
brain, but nowhere else.

“I’m all right,” said Sto Odin. 
"I can continue as I have done 
for the last several hundred 
years. Leave me set up on this 
high life-output. I can stand it 
for a few hours, and if I can- 
not, there’s little lost.” He put 
the manikin back in its bag, 
hung the bag on the door-handle 
of the sedan-chair and command- 
ed the legionaries, “Proceed!” 

The legionaries stared at him 
as if they could not see him. 

He followed the lines of glance 
and saw that they were gazing 
rigidly at his manikin mee. It had 
turned black. 

“Are you dead?” asked Liv- 
ius, speaking as hoarsely as a 
robot could. 

“Not dead at all!” cried Sto 
Odin. “I have been death in 
fractions of a moment, but for 
the time I am still life. That 
was just the pain -sum of my 
living body which showed on 
the manikin meee. The fire of 
life still burns within me. Watch 
as I put the manikin away. ” 
The doll flared into a swirl of 
pastel orange as the Lord Sto 
Odin pulled the cover down. 

They looked away as though 
they had seen an evil or an ex- 
plosion. 

“Down, men, down,” he cried, 
calling them wrong names as 
they stepped back between their 
carrying shafts to take him deep- 
er under the vitals of the earth. 



Tie dreamed brown dreams 
-*■ while they trotted down 
endless ramps. He woke a little 
to see the yellow walls passing. 
He looked at his dry old hand 
and it seemed to him that in 
this atmosphere, he had himself 
become more reptilian than hu- 
man. 

“I am caught by the dry, drab 
enturtlement of old, old age,” he 
murmured, but the voice was 
weak and the robots did not 
hear him. They were running 
downward on a long meaning- 
less concrete ramp which had 
become filmed by a leak of an- 
cient oil, and they were taking 
care that they did not stumble 
and drop their precious master. 

At a deep, hidden point the 
downward ramp divided, the 
left into a broad arena of steps 
which could have seated thou- 
sands of spectators for some 
never-to-occur event, and right 
into a narrow ramp which bore 
upward and then curved, yellow 
lights and all. 

“Stop!” called Sto Odin. “Do 
you see her? Do you hear it?” 
“Hear what?” said Flavius. 
“The beat and the cadence of 
the congohelium, rising out of 
the Gebiet. The whirl and the 
skirl of impossible music coming 
at us through miles of solid 
rock? That girl whom I can al- 



22

ready see, waiting at a door 
which should never have been 
opened? The sound of the star- 
borne music, not- designed for 
the proper human ear?” He 
shouted, “Can’t you hear it? 
That cadence. The unlawful met- 
al of congohelium so terribly 
far underground? Dah, dah. 
Dah, dah. Dah. Music which no- 
body has ever understood be- 
fore?” 

Said Flavius, “I hear nothing, 
saving the pulse of air in this 
corridor, and your own heart- 
beat, my Lord. And something 
else, a little like machinery, very 
far away.” 

“There, that!” cried Sto Odin, 
“which you call ‘a little like 
machinery,’ does it come in a 
beat of five separate sounds, 
each one distinct?” 

“No. No, sir. Not five.” 

“And you, Livius, when you 
were a man, you were very tele- 
pathic? Is there any of that left 
in the robot which is you?” 

“No, my Lord, nothing. I have 
good senses, and I am also cut 
into the subsurface radio of the 
Instrumentality. Nothing unusu- 
al.” 

“No five beat? Each note sep- 
arate, short of prolonged, given 
meaning and shape by the ter- 
rible music of the congohelium, 
imprisoned with us inside this 
much-too-solid rock? You hear 
nothing?” 



The two robots, shaped like 
Roman legionaries shook their 
heads. 

“But I can see her, through 
this stone. She has breasts like 
ripe pears and dark brown eyes 
that are like the stones of fresh- 
cut peaches. And I can hear 
what they are singing, their 
weird silly words of a pentapaul, 
made into something majestic by 
the awful music of the congohe- 
lium. Listen to the words. When 
I repeat them, they sound just 
silly, because the dread-inspir- 
ing music does not come with 
them. Her name is Santuna and 
she stares at him. No wonder 
she stares. He is much more tall 
than most men, yet he makes 
this foolish song into something 
frightening and strange. 

Slim Jim. 

Dim him. 

Grim. 

And his name is Yebayee, but 
now he is Sun-boy. He has the 
long face and the thick lips of 
the first man to talk about one 
god and one only. Akhnaton.” 

“Akhnaton the pharaoh,” said 
Flavius. “That name was known 
in my office when I was a man. 
It was a secret. One of the first 
and greatest of the more-than- 
ancient kings. You see him, my 
Lord?” 

“Through this rock I see him. 
Through this rock I hear the

delirium engendered by the con- 
gohelium. I go to him.” The 
Lord Sto Odin stepped out of the 
sedan chair and beat softly and 
weakly against the solid stone 
wall of the corridor. The yellow 
lamps gleamed. The legionaries 
were helpless. Here was some- 
thing which their sharp swords 
could not pierce. Their once- 
humah personalities, engraved 
on their micro-miniaturized 
brains, could not make sense out 
of the all-too-human situation of 
an old, old man dreaming wild 
dreams in a remote tunnel. 

Qto Odin leaned against the 
wall, breathing heavily, 
and said to them with a sibilant 

rasp: 

‘‘These are no whispers which 
can be missed. Can’t you hear 
the five-beat of the congohelium, 
making its crazy music again? 
Listen to the words of this one. 
It’s another pentapaul. Silly 
bony words given flesh and 
blood and entrails by the music 
which carries them. Here, listen. 

Try. Vie. 

Cry. Die. 

Bye. 

This one you did not hear 
either?” 

“May I use my radio to ask 
the surface of Earth for advice?” 
said one of the robots. 

“Advice! Advice! What advice 

24 



do we need? This is the Gebiet 
and one more hour of running 
and you will be in the heart 
of the Bezirk.” 

He climbed back into the 
sedan chair and commanded, 
“Run, men, run! It can’t be more 
than three or four kilometers 
somewhere in this warren of 
stone. I will guide you. If I stop 
guiding you, you may take my 
body back to the surface, so that 
I can be given a wonderful 
funeral and be shot with a rock- 
et-coffin into space with an or- 
bit of no return. You have noth- 
ing to worry about. You are 
machines, nothing more, are you 
not? Are you not?” His voice 
shrilled at the end. 

Said Flavius, “Nothing more.” 

Said Livius, “Nothing more. 
And yet — ” 

“And yet what?” demanded 
the Lord Sto Odin. 

“And yet,” said Livius, ‘T 
know I am a machine, and I 
know that I have known feelings 
only when I was once a living 
man. I sometimes wonder if you 
people might go too far. Too far, 
with us robots. Too far, perhaps, 
with the underpeople too. 
Things were once simple, when 
everything that talked was a 
human being and everything 
which did not talk was not. You 
may be coming to an ending of 
the ways.” 

“If you had said that on the 

GALAXY 



surface,” said the Lord Sto Odin 
grimly, “your head might have 
been burned off by its automatic 
magnesium flare. You know that 
there you are monitored against 
having illegal thoughts.” 

“Too well do I know it,” said 
Livius, “and I know that I must 
have died once as a man, if I 
exist here in robot form. Dying 
didn’t seem to hurt me then and 
it probably won’t hurt next time. 
But nothing really matters much 
when we get down this far into 
the earth. When we get this far 
down, everything changes. I nev- 
er really understood that the in- 
side of the world was this big 
and this sick.” 

"It’s not how far down 
we are,” said the Lord crossly, 
“it’s where we are. This is the 
Gebiet, where all laws have been 
lifted, and down below and over 
yonder is the Bezirk, where laws 
have never been. Carry me ra- 
pidly now. I want to look on 
this strange musician with the 
face of Akhnaton and I want 
to talk to the girl who worships 
him, Santuna. Run carefully 
now. Up a little, to the left a 
little. If I sleep, do not worry. 
Keep going. I will waken my- 
self when we come anywhere 
near that music of the congohe- 
lium. If I can hear it now, so 
far away, think of what it will 
be like when you yourselves ap- 
proach it!” 



He leaned back in his seat. 
They picked up the shafts of the 
sedan-chair and ran in the di- 
rection which they had been 
told. 

VI 

^r'hey had run for more than 
-*■ an hour, with occasional 
delays when they had tricky 
footwork over leaking pipes or 
damaged walkways, when the 
light became so bright that they 
had to reach in their pouches 
and put on sun-glasses, which 
looked very odd indeed under- 
neath the Roman helmets of two 
fully-armed legionaries. (It was 
even more odd, of course, that 
the eyes were not eyes at all; 
robot eyes were like white mar- 
bles swimming in little bowls of 
glittering ink, producing a grim- 
ly milky stare.) They looked at 
their master and he had not yet 
stirred, so they took a corner of 
his robe and twisted it firmly 
into a bandage to protect his 
eyes against the bright light. 

The new light made the yel- 
low bulbs of the corridor fade 
out of notice. The light was like 
a whole aurora borealis com- 
pressed and projected through 
the basement corridor of a hotel 
left over from long ago. Neither 
of the robots knew the nature 
of the light, but it pulsed in 
beats of five. 



UNDER OLD EARTH 



25 



The music and the lights be- 
came obtrusive even to the two 
robots as they walked or trotted 
downward toward the center of 
the world. The air-forcing sys- 
tem must have been very strong, 
because the inner heat of the 
earth had not reached them, 
even at this great depth. Flavius 
had no idea of how many kilome- 
ters below the surface they had 
come. He knew that it was not 
much in planetary distance, but 
it was very far indeed for an 
ordinary walk. 

The Lord Sto Odin sat up in 
the litter quite suddenly. When 
the two robots slowed, he said 
crossly at them: 

“Keep going. Keep going. I 
am going to set myself up. I’m 
strong enough to do it.” 

He took out his manikin meee 
and studied it in the light of 
the minor aurora borealis which 
repeated itself in the corridor. 
The manikin ran through its 
changes of diagnoses and colors. 
The Lord was satisfied. With 
firm old fingers he put the 
knifetip to the back of his neck 
and set his output of vital ener- 
gies at an even higher level. 

The robots did what they had 
been told. 

The lights had been be- 
wildering. Sometimes they made 
walking itself difficult. It was 
hard to believe that dozens or 
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of 



human beings had found their 
way through these uncharted cor- 
ridors in order to discover the 
inmost precincts of Bezirk, where 
all things were allowed. Yet the 
robots had to believe it. They 
themselves had been here before 
and they scarcely remembered 
how they had found their way 
the other time. 

And the music ! It beat at them 
harder than ever before. It came 
in beats of five, ringing out the 
tones of the pentapaul, the five- 
word verse which the mad cat- 
minstrel C’paul had developed 
while playing his c’lute some cen- 
turies before. The form itself con 
firmed and reinforced the poig- 
nancy of cats combined with the 
heartbreaking intelligence of the 
human being. No wonder people 
had found their way down here. 

In all the history of man, there 
was no act which could not be 
produced by any one of the three 
bitterest forces in the human spir- 
it — religious faith, vengeful 
vainglory or sheer vice. Here, for 
the sake of vice, men had found 
the undiscoverable deep and had 
put it to wild, filthy uses. The 
music called them on. 

This was very special music. It 
came at Sto Odin and his legion- 
aries in two utterly different ways 
by now, reverberating at them 
through solid rock and echoing, 
re-echoing through the maze of 
corridors, carried by the dark 



26 



GALAXY 



heavy air. The corridor lights 
were still yellow, but the electro- 
magnetic illuminations, which 
kept time to the music, made the 
ordinary lighting seem wan. The 
music controlled all things, paced 
all time, called all life to itself. 
It was song of a kind which the 
two robots had not noticed with 
such intensity on their previous 
visit. 

Even the Lord Sto Odin, for 
all his travels and experiences, 
had never heard it before. 

It was all of this: 

The beat and the heat and the 
neat repeat of the notes which 
poured from the congohelium — 
metal never made for music, mat- 
ter and anti-matter locked in a 
fine magnetic grid to ward off 
the outermost perils of space. 
Now a piece of it was deep in 
the body of old Earth, counting 
out strange cadences. The churn 
and the bum and the hot return 
of music riding the living rock, 
accompanying itself in an air- 
carried echo. The surge and the 
urge of an erotic dirge which 
moaned, groaned through the 
heavy stone. 

Sto Odin woke and stared 
sharply forward, seeing nothing 
but experiencing everything. 

“Soon we shall see the gate and 
the girl,” said he. 

“You know this, man? You 
who have never been here be- 
fore?” Livius had spoken. 

UNDER OLD EARTH 



“I know it,” said the Lord Sto 
Odin, “because I know it.” 

“You wear the feathers of im- 
munity.” 

“I wear the feathers of immun- 
ity.” 

“Does that mean that we, your 
robots, are free too, down in this 
Bezirk?” 

“Free as you like,” said the 
Lord Sto Odin, “provided that 
you do my wishes. Otherwise I 
shall kill you.” 

“If we keep going,” said Flav- 
ius, “may we sing the underpeo- 
ple song? It might keep some of 
that terrible music out of our 
brains. The music has all feelings 
and we have none. Nevertheless, 
it disturbs us. I do not know 
why.” 

“My radio contact with the 
surface has lapsed,” said Livius 
irrelevantly. “I need to sing too.” 

“Go ahead, both of you,” said 
the Lord Sto Odin. “But keep 
on going, or you die.” 

The robots lifted their voice 
in song : 

I eat my rage. 

I swallow my grief. 

There’s no relief 

From pain or age. 

Our time comes. 

I work my life. 

I breathe my breath. 

I face my death 

Without a wife. 

Our time comes. 

We undermen 

Shove, crush and crash. 

There’ll be a clash 

And thunder when 
Our time comes. 



27 



'"T'hough the song had the bar- 
barous ancient thrill of bag- 
pipes in it, the melody could not 
counter or cancel the sane wild 
rhythm of the congohelium beat- 
ing at them, now, from all direc- 
tions at once. 

“Nice piece of sedition, that,” 
said the Lord Sto Odin drily, 
“but I like it better as music 
than I do this noise which is 
tearing its way through the 
depths of the world. Keep going. 
Keep going. I must meet this 
mystery before I die.” 

“We find it hard to endure that 
music coming at us through the 
rock,” said Livius. 

“It seems to us that it is much 
stronger than it was when we 
came here some months ago. 
Could it have changed?” asked 
Flavius. 

“That is the mystery. We let 
them have the Gebiet, beyond 
our own jurisdiction. We gave 
them the Bezirk, to do with as 
they please. But these ordinary 
people have created or encount- 
ered some extraordinary power. 
They have brought new things 
into the Earth. It may be neces- 
sary for all three of us to die 
before we settle the matter.” 

“We can’t die the way you 
do,” said Livius. “We’re already 
robots, and the people from 
whom we were imprinted have 
been dead a long time. Do you 
mean you would turn us off?” 
28 



“I would, perhaps, or else some 
other force. Would you mind?” 

“Mind? You mean, have emo- 
tions about it? I don’t know,” 
said Flavius. “I used to think 
that I had real, full experience 
when you used the phrase sum- 
ma nulla est and brought us up 
to full capacity, but that music 
which we have been hearing has 
the effect of a thousand pass- 
words all said at once. I am be- 
ginning to care about my life 
and I think that I am becoming 
what your reference explained 
by the word ‘afraid’.” 

“I too feel it,” said Livius. 
“This is not a power which we 
knew to exist on Earth before. 
When I was a strategist someone 
told me about the really in- 
describable dangers connected 
with the Douglas-Ouyang plan- 
ets, and it seems to me now that 
a danger of that kind is already 
with us, here inside the tunnel. 
Something which Earth never 
made. Something which man 
never developed. Something 
which no robot could out-com- 
pute. Something wild and very 
strong brought into being by the 
use of the congohelium. Look 
around us.” 

He did not need to say that. 
The corridor itself had become 
a living, pulsing rainbow. 

They turned one last loop in 
the corridor and they were 
there — 



GALAXY 



The very last limit of the realm 
of distress. 

The source of evil music. 

The end of the Bezirk. 

They knew it because the mus- 
ic blinded them, the lights deaf- 
ened them, their senses ran into 
one another and became con- 
fused. This was the immediate 
presence of the congohelium. 

There was a door, immensely 
large, carved v/ith elaborate 
Gothic ornament. It was much 
too big for any human man to 
have had need of it. In the door 
a single figure stood, her breasts 
accented into vivid brights and 
darks by the brilliant light 
which poured from one side of 
the door only, the right. 

They could see through the 
door, into an immense hall 
wherein the floor was covered 
by hundreds of limp bundles of 
ragged clothing. These were the 
people, unconscious. Above them 
and between them there danced 
the high figure of a male, hold- 
ing a glittering something in his 
hands. He prowled and leaped 
and twisted and turned to the 
pulsation of the music which he 
himself produced. 

“Summa nulla est,” said the 
Lord Sto Odin. “I want you two 
robots to be keyed to maximum. 
Are you now to top alert?” 

“We are, sir,” chorused Livius 
and Flavius. 

“You have your weapons?” 



“We cannot use them,” said 
Livius, “since it is contrary to 
our programming, but you can 
use them, sir.” > 

“I’m not sure,” said Flavius. 
“I’m not at all sure. We are 
equipped with surface weapons. 
This music, these hypnotics, 
these lights — who knows what 
they may have done to us and 
to our weapons, which were nev- 
er designed to operate this far 
underground?” 

“No fear,” said Sto Odin, “I’ll 
take care of all of it.” 

He took out a small knife. 
When the knife gleamed un- 
der the dancing lights, the girl 
in the doorway finally took no- 
tice of the Lord Sto Odin and 
his strange companions. 

She spoke to him, and her 
voice rode through the heavy air 
with the accents of clarity and 
death. 

VII 

tc W7 ho are y° u ” s ^ e sa ^’ 

' ' “that you should bring 
weapons to the last uttermost 
limits of the Bezirk?” 

“This is just a small knife, 
lady,” said the Lord Sto Odin, 
“and with this I can do no harm 
to anyone. I am an old man 
and I am setting my own vitality 
button higher.” 

She watched incuriously as he 
brought the point of the knife 



UNDER OLD EARTH 



29 



to the nape of his own neck 
and then gave it three full, de- 
liberate turns. 

Then she stared and said, “You 
are strange, my Lord. Perhaps 
you are dangerous to my friends 
and me.” 

“I am dangerous to no one.” 
The robots looked at him, sur- 
prised, because of the fullness 
and the richness of his voice. He 
had set his vitality very high 
indeed, giving himself, at that 
rate, perhaps no more than an 
hour or two of life, but he had 
regained the physical power and 
the emotional force of his own 
prime years. They looked at the 
girl. She had taken Sto Odin’s 
statement at full face value, al- 
most as though it were an in- 
controvertible canon of faith. 

“I wear,” Sto Odin went on, 
“these feathers. Do you know 
what they signify?” 

“I can see,” she said, “that 
you are a Lord of the Instru- 
mentality, but I do not know 
what the feathers mean. .” 

“Waiver of immunity. Anyone 
who can manage it is allowed 
to kill me or to hurt me without 
danger of punishment.” He 
smiled, a little grimly. “Of 
course, I have the right to fight 
back, and I do know how to 
fight. My name is the Lord Sto 
Odin. Why are you here, girl?” 

“I love that man in there — 
if he is a man any more.” 

30 



She stopped and pursed her 
lips in bewilderment. It was 
strange to see those girlish lips 
compressed in a momentary 
stammer of the soul. She stood 
there, more nude than a new- 
born infant, her face covered 
with provocative, off-beat cos- 
metics. She lived for a mission 
of love in the depths of the 
nothing and nowhere: yet she 
remained a girl, a person, a hu- 
man being capable, as she was 
now, of an immediate relation 
ship to another human being. 

“He was a man, my Lord, even 
when he came back from the 
surface with that piece of 
congohelium. Only a few weeks 
ago, those people were dancing 
too. Now they just lie on the 
ground. They do not even die. 
I myself held the congohelium 
too, and I made music with it. 
Now the power of the music is 
eating him up and he dances 
without resting. He won’t come 
out to me and I do not dare go 
into that place with him. Per- 
haps I too would end up as one 
more heap on the floor.” 

A crescendo of the intolerable 
music made speech intolerable 
for her. She waited for it to pass 
while the room beyond blazed 
a pulsing violet at them. 

When the music of the congo- 
helium subsided a little, Sto 
Odin spoke: “How long has it 
been that he has danced alone 



GALAXY 



with this strange power coursing 
through him?” 

“One year. Two years. Who 
can tell? I came down here and 
lost time when I arrived. You 
Lords don’t even let us have 
clocks and calendars up on the 
surface.” 

“We ourselves saw you danc- 
ing just a tenth-year ago,” said 
Livius, interrupting. 

She glanced at them, quickly, 
incuriously. “Are you the same 
two robots who were here a 
while back? You look very dif- 
ferent now. You look like an- 
cient soldiers. I can’t imagine 
why . All right, maybe it was 
a week, maybe it was a year.” 

“What were you doing down 
here?” asked Sto Odin gently. 

“What do you think?” she 
said. “Why do all the other 
people come down here? I was 
running away from the timeless 
time, the lifeless life, the hope- 
less hope that you Lords apply 
to all mankind on the surface. 
You let the robots and the un- 
derpeople work, but you freeze 
the real people in a happiness 
which has no hope and no es- 
cape.” 

"I’m right,” cried Sto Odin, 
“I’m right, though I die for it!” 

“I don’t understand you,” said 
the girl. “Do you mean that you 
too, a Lord, have come down 
here to escape from the useless 
hope that wraps up all of us?” 



“No, no, no,” he said, as the 
shifting lights of the congoheE- 
um music made improbable trac- 
eries across his features. “I just 
meant that I told the other Lords 
that something like this was 
happening to you ordinary peo- 
ple on the surface. Now you are 
telling me exactly what I told 
them. Who were you, anyhow?” 

e girl glanced down at her 
unclothed body as though 
she were aware, for the first 
time, of her nakedness. Sto Odin 
could see the blush pour from 
her face down across her neck 
and chest. She said, very quietly: 
“Don’t you know? We never 
answer that question down 
here.” 

“You have rules?” he said. 
“You people have rules, even 
here in the Bezirk?” 

She brightened up when she 
realized that he had not meant 
the indecent question as an im- 
propriety. Eagerly she explain- 
ed, "There aren’t any rules. 
They are just understandings. 
Somebody told me when I left 
the ordinary world and crossed 
the line of the Gebiet. I sup- 
pose they did not tell you be- 
cause you were a Lord, or be- 
cause they hid from your strange 
war-robots.” 

“I met no one, coming down.” 
“Then they were hiding from 
you, my Lord.” 

31 




UNDER OLD EARTH 



Sto Odin looked around at his 
legionaries to see if they would 
confirm that statement but nei- 
ther Flavius nor Livius said any- 
thing at all. 

He turned back to the girl. 
“I didn’t mean to pry. Can you 
tell me what kind of person you 
are? I don’t need the particu- 
lars.” 

“When I was alive, I was a 
once-born,” she said. “I did not 
live long enough to be renewed. 
The robots and a Subcommis- 
sioner of the Instrumentality 
took a look at me to see if I 
could be trained for the Instru- 
mentality. More than enough 
brains, they said, but no char- 
acter at all. I thought about that 
a long time. ‘No character at 
all.’ I knew I couldn’t kill my 
self, and I didn’t want to live, 
so I looked happy every time 
I thought a monitor might be 
scanning me and I found my 
way to the Gebiet. It wasn’t 
death, and it wasn’t life, but it 
was an escape from endless fun. 
I hadn’t been down here 
long — ” she pointed at the Geb- 
iet above them — “before I met 
him. We loved each other very 
soon and he said that the Gebiet 
was not much improvement on 
the surface. He said he had al- 
ready been down here, in the 
Bezirk looking for a fun-death.” 

“A what?” said Sto Odin, as 
if he could not believe the words. 

32 



“A fun-death. Those were his 
words and his idea. I followed 
him around and we loved each 
other. I waited for him when 
he went to the surface to get the 
congohelium. I thought that his 
love for me would put the fun- 
death out of his mind.” 

“Are you telling me the whole 
truth?” said Sto Odin. “Or is 
this just your part of the story?” 
She stammered protests but 
he did not ask again. 

The Lord Sto Odin said noth- 
ing but he looked heavily at her. 

She winced, bit her lip, and 
finally said, through all the mu- 
sic and the lights, very clearly 
indeed, “Stop it. You are hurt- 
ing me.” 

The Lord Sto Odin stared at 
her, said innocently, “I am do- 
ing nothing,” and stared on. 
There was much to stare at. She 
was a girl the color of honey. 
Even through these lights and 
shadows he could see that she 
had no clothing at all. Nor did 
she have a single hair left on 
her body — no head of hair, no 
eyebrows, probably no eyelashes, 
though he could not tell at that 
distance. She had traced golden 
eyebrows far up on her forehead, 
giving her the look of endless 
mocking inquiry. She had paint- 
ed her mouth gold, so that when 
she spoke, her words cascaded 
from a golden source. She had 
painted her upper eyelids gold-

en too, but the lower were black 
as carbon itself. The total effect 
was alien to all the previous 
experiences of mankind: it was 
lascivious grief to the thou- 
sandth power, dry wantonness 
perpetually unfulfilled, female- 
ness in the service of remote 
purposes, humanity enraptured 
by strange planets. 

He stood and stared. If she 
were still human at all, this 
would sooner or later force her 
to take the initiative. It did. 

She spoke again, “Who are 
you? You are living too fast, too 
fiercely. Why don’t you go in 
and dance, like all the others?” 
She gestured past the open door, 
where the ragged unconscious 
shapes of all the people lay 
strewn about the floor. 

“You call that dancing?” said 
the Lord Sto Odin. “I do not. 
There is one man who dances. 
Those others lie on the floor. 
Let me ask you the same ques- 
tion. Why don’t you dance your- 
self?” 

“I want him, not the dance. 
I am Santuna and he seized me 
once in human, mortal, ordinary 
love. But he becomes Sun-boy, 
more so every day, and he dances 
with those people who lie on 
the floor — ” 

“You call that dancing?” 
snapped the Lord Sto Odin. He 
shook his head and added grim- 
ly, “I see no dance.” 



“You don’t see it? You really 
don’t see it?” she cried. 

He shook his head obstinately 
and grimly. 

Qhe turned so that she looked 
^ into the room beyond her 
and she brought her high, clear 
penetrating wail which even cut 
through the five-beat pulse of 
the congohelium. She cried: 
“Sun-boy, Sun-boy, hear mef” 
There was no break in the 
quick escape of the feet which 
pattered in the figure eight, no 
slowing down the fingers which 
beat against the shimmering non- 
focus of the metal which was 
carried in the dancer’s arms. 

“My lover, my beloved, my 
man!” she cried again, her voice 
even more shrill and demanding 
than before. 

There was a break in the ca- 
dence of the music and the 
dance. The dancer sheered 
toward them with a perceptible 
slowing down of his cadence. 
The lights of the inner room, 
the great door and the outer hall 
all became more steady. Sto 
Odin could see the girl more 
clearly; she really didn’t have a 
single hair on her body. He 
could see the dancer too; the 
young man was tall, thin beyond 
the ordinary suffering of man, 
and the metal which he carried 
shimmered like water reflecting 
a thousand lights. The dancer 



34 



GALAXY 



spoke, quickly and angrily: 

“You called me. You have 
called me thousands of times. 
Come on in, if you wish. But 
don’t call me.” 

As he spoke, the music faded 
out completely, the bundles on 
the floor began to stir and to 
groan and to awaken. 

Santuna stammered hastily, 
“This time it wasn’t me. It was 
these people. One of them is very 
strong. He cannot see the danc- 
ers.” 

The Sun-boy turned to the 
Lord Sto Odin, “Come in and 
dance then, if you wish. You 
are already here. You might as 
well. Those machines of yours 
— ” he nodded at the robot- 
legionaries — “they couldn’t 
dance anyhow. Turn them off.” 
The dancer started to turn away. 

“I shall not dance, but I would 
like to see it,” said Sto Odin, 
with enforced mildness. He did 
not like this young man at all 
— not the phosphorescence of 
his skin, the dangerous metal 
cradled in his arm, the suicidal 
recklessness of his prancing 
walk. Anyhow, there was too 
much light this far underground 
and too few explanations of 
what was being done. 

“Man, you’re a peeper. That’s 
real nasty, for an old man like 
you. Or do you just want to be 
a man?” 

The Lord Sto Odin felt his 



temper flare up. “Who are you, 
man, that you should call man 
man in such a tone? Aren’t you 
still human, yourself?” 

“Who knows? Who cares? I 
have tapped the music of the 
universe. I have piped all imag- 
inable happiness into this room. 
I am generous. I share it with 
these friends of mine.” Sun -boy 
gestured at the ragged heaps on 
the floor, who had begun to 
squirm in their misery without 
the music. As Sto Odin saw into 
the room more clearly, he could 
see that the bundles on the floor 
were young people, mostly young 
men, though there were a few 
girls among them. They all of 
them looked sick and weak and 
pale. 

Sto Odin retorted. “I don’t 
like the looks of this. I have 
half a mind to seize you and to 
take that metal.” 

The dancer spun on the ball 
of his right foot, as though to 
leap away in a wild prance. 

The Lord Sto Odin stepped 
into the room after Sun-boy. 

Sun-boy turned full circle, so 
that he faced Sto Odin once 
again. He pushed the Lord out 
of the door, marching him firm- 
ly but irresistably three steps 
backward. 

“Flavius, seize the metal. Liv- 
ius, take the man,” spat Sto 
Odin. 

Neither robot moved. 



UNDER OLD EARTH

S to Odin, his senses and his 
strength set high by the 
severe twist upward which he 
had given his vitality button, 
stepped forward to seize the con- 
gohelium himself. Made one 
step and no more: he froze in 
he doorway, immobile. 

He had not felt like that since 
he last time the doctors put him 
in a surgery machine, when they 
found that part of his skull had 
developed bone-cancer from old, 
old radiation in space and from 
the subsequent effects of sheer 
age. They had given him a pros- 
thetic half-skull and for the 
time of the operation he had 
been immobilized by straps and 
drugs. This time there were no 
straps, no drugs, but the forces 
which Sun-boy had invoked were 
equally strong. 

The dancer danced in an enor- 
mous figure-8 among the clothed 
bodies lying on the floor. He 
had been singing the song which 
the robot Flavius had repeated 
far up above, on the surface of 
the Earth — the song about the 
weeping man. 

But Sun-boy did not weep. 
His ascetic, thin face was 
twisted in a broad grin of mock- 
ery. When he sang about sorrow 
it was not sorrow which he really 
expressed, but derision, laughter, 
contempt for ordinary human 
sorrow. The congohelium shim- 
mered and the aurora borealis 



almost blinded Sto Odin. There 
were two other drums in the 
middle of the room, one with 
high notes and the other with 
even higher ones. 

The congohelium resonated : 
boom — boom — doom — doom 
— room! 

The large ordinary drum rat- 
tled out, when Sun-boy passed 
at and reached out his fingers: 
ritiplin, ritiplin, rataplan, rtti- 
plin\ 

The small, strange drum emit- 
ted only two notes, and it almost 
croaked them: kid-nork, kid- 

nork, kid-nork! 

As Sun-boy danced back 
the Lord Sto Odin thought that 
he could hear the voice of the 
girl Santuna, calling to Sun-boy, 
but he could not turn his head 
to see if she were speaking. 

Sun -boy stood in front of Sto 
Odin, his feet still weaving as 
he danced, his thumbs and his 
palms torturing hypnotic dis- 
sonances from the gleaming 
congohelium. 

“Old man, you tried to trick 
me. You failed.” 

The Lord Sto Odin tried to 
speak, but the muscles of his 
mouth and throat would not 
respond. He wondered what 
force this was, which could stop 
all unusual effort but still leave 
his heart free to beat, his lungs 
to breathe, his brain (both nat- 
ural and prosthetic) to think.

The boy danced on. He danced 
away a few steps, turned and 
danced back to Sto Odin. 

“You wear the feathers of im- 
munity. I am free to kill you. 
If I did the Lady Mmona and 
the Lord Nuru-or and your other 
friends would never know what 
happened.” 

If Sto Odin could have moved 
his eyelids that much, he would 
have opened his eyes in aston- 
ishment at the discovery that a 
superstitious dancer, far under 
ground, knew the secret business 
of the Instrumentality. 

“You can’t believe what you 
ire looking at, even though you 
see it plainly,” said Sun-boy 
more seriously. “You think that 
a lunatic has found a way to 
work wonders with a piece of 
the congohelium taken far un- 
derground. Foolish old man! No 
ordinary lunatic would have car- 
ried this metal down here with 
out blowing up the fragment 
and himself with it. No man 
could have done what I have 
done. You are thinking. If the 
gambler who took the name Sun- 
boy is not a man, what is he? 
What brings the power and mu- 
sic of the sun so far down under 
ground? Who makes the wretch- 
ed ones of the world dream in 
a crazy, happy sleep while their 
life spills and leaks into a thou- 
sand kinds of times, a thousand 
kinds of worlds? Who does it, 



if it is not mere me? You don’t 
have to ask. I can tell perfectly 
well what you are thinking. I’ll 
dance it for you. I am a very 
kind man, even though you do 
not like me.” 

The dancer’s feet had been 
moving in the same place while 
he spoke. 

Suddenly he whirled away, 
leaping and vaulting over the 
wretched human figures on the 
floor. 

H e passed the big drum and 
touched it: rrtiptm, rata- 
plan ! 

Left hand brushed the little 
drum: kid-nork, kid-nork! 

Both hands seized the congo- 
helium, as though the strong 
wrists were going to tear it apart. 

The whole room blazed with 
music, gleamed with thunder as 
the human senses interpenetrat- 
ed each other. The Lord Sto 
Odin felt the air pass his skin 
like cool wet oil. Sun-boy the 
dancer became transparent and 
through him the Lord Sto Odin 
could see a landscape which was 
not earth and never would be. 

“Fluminescent, luminescent, 
incandescent, fluorescent,” sang 
the dancer. “Those are the 
worlds of tire Douglas-Ouyang 
planets, seven planets in a close 
group, all travelling together 
around a single sun. Worlds of 
wild magnetism and perpetual 



UNDER OLD EARTH 



37 



dustfall, where the surfaces of 
the planets are changed by the 
forever-shifting magnetism of 
their erratic orbits! Strange 
worlds, where stars dance dances 
wilder than any dance ever con- 
ceived by man — Planets which 
have a consciousness in common, 
but perhaps not intelligence — 
planets which called across all 
space and all time for compan- 
ionship until /, me the gambler, 
came down to this cavern and 
found them. Where you had left 
them, my Lord Sto Odin, when 
you said to a robot: 

“ ‘I do not like the looks of 
those planets,’ said you, Sto 
Odin, speaking to a robot a long 
time ago. ‘People might get sick 
or crazy, just looking at them,’ 
said you, Sto Odin, long, long 
ago. ‘Hide the knowledge in 
some out of the way computer,’ 
you commanded, Sto Odin, be- 
fore I was bom. But the com- 
puter was that one, that one in 
the comer behind you, which 
you cannot turn to see. I came 
down to this room, looking for 
a fun-suicide, something really 
unusual which would bang the 
noddies when they found I had 
gotten away. I danced here in 
the darkness, almost the way I 
am dancing now, and I had taken 
about twelve different kinds of 
drugs, so that I was wild and free 
and very very receptive. That 
computer spoke to me, Sto Odin. 



Your computer, not mine. It 
spoke to me, and you know what 
it said? 

“You might as well know, Sto 
Odin, because you are dying. 
You set your vitality high in 
order to fight me. I have made 
you stand still. Could I do that 
if I were a mere man? Look. I 
will turn solid again.” 

With a rainbow-like scream of 
chords and sounds, Sun-boy 
twisted the congohelium again 
until both the inner chamber 
and the outer bloomed with 
lights of a thousand colors and 
the deep underground air be- 
came drenched with music 
which seemed psychotic, because 
no human mind had ever in- 
vented it. The Lord Sto Odin, 
imprisoned in his own body 
with his two legionary-robots 
frozen half a pace behind him, 
wondered if he really were dy- 
ing in vain and tried to guess 
whether he would be blinded 
and deafened by this dancer be- 
fore he died. The congohelium 
twisted and shone before him. 

Sun-boy danced backward 
over the bodies on the floor, 
danced backward with an odd 
cadenced run which looked as 
though he were plunging for- 
ward in a wild, competitive foot- 
race when the music and his 
own footsteps carried him back, 
toward the center of the inner 
room. The figure jumped in an 



38 



GALAXY 



odd stance, face looking so far 
downward that Sun-boy might 
have been studying his own steps 
on the floor, the congohelium 
held above and behind his neck, 
legs lifting high in the cruel high- 
kneed prance. 

The Lord Sto Odin thought 
he could hear the girl calling 
again, but he could not distin- 
guish words. 

The drums spoke again: riti- 
plin, ritiplin, rataplan! and then 
kid-nork, kid-nork, kid-nork! 

The dancer spoke as the pan- 
demonium subsided. He spoke, 
as his voice was high, strange, 
like a bad recording played on 
the wrong machine : 

“The something is talking to 
you. You can talk.” 

The Lord Sto Odin found that 
his throat and Kps moved. Quiet- 
ly, secretly, like an old soldier, 
he tried his feet and fingers: 
these did not move. Only his 
voice could be used. He spoke, 
and he said the obvious: 

“Who are you, something ?” 
Sun-boy looked across at Sto 
Odin. He stood erect and calm. 
Only his feet moved, and they 
did a wild, agile Kttle jig which 
did not affect the rest of his 
body. Apparently some kind of 
dance was necessary to keep the 
connection going between the 
unexplained reach of the Doug- 
las-Ouyang planets, the piece of 
the congohelium, the more than 



human dancer and the tortured 
blissful figures on the floor. The 
face, the face itself was quite 
composed and almost sad. 

“I have been told,” said Sun- 
boy, “to show you who I am.” 

TJe danced around the drums 

^ rataplan, rataplan! kid- 
nork-nork, kid-nork, kid-nork- 
nork! 

He held the congohelium high 
and wrenched it so that a great 
moan came out. Sto Odin felt 
sure that a sound as wild and 
forlorn as that would be sure to 
reach the surface of the earth 
many kilometers above, but his 
prudent judgment assured him 
that this was a fanciful thought, 
gestated by his personal situa- 
tion, and that any real sound 
strong enough to reach all the 
way to the surface would also 
be strong enough to bring the 
bruised and shattered rock of 
the ceiling pouring down upo r 
their heads. 

The congohelium ran down 
the colors of the spectrum unti’ 
it stopped at a dark, wet liver 
red, very close to black. 

The Lord Sto Odin, in thrd 
momentary near silence, found 
that the entire story had been 
thrust into his mind without be- 
ing strung out and articulated 
with words. The true history of 
this chamber had entered his 
memory sidewise, as it were. In 



UNDER OID EARTH 



39 



one moment he knew nothing of 
it; in the next instance it was 
as if he had remembered the 
whole narrative for most of his 
life. 

He also felt himself set free. 

He stumbled backward three 
or four steps. 

To his immense relief, his ro- 
bots turned around, themselves 
free, and accompanied him. He 
let them put their hands in his 
armpits. 

His face was suddenly covered 
with kisses. 

His plastic cheek felt, thinly 
and dimly, the imprint, real and 
living, of female human lips. 
It was the odd girl — beautiful, 
bald, naked and golden-lipped 
— who had waited and shouted 
'rom the door. 

Despite physical fatigue and 
the sudden shock of intruded 
knowledge, the Lord Sto Odin 
knew what he had to say. 

“Girl, you shouted for me.” 

“Yes, my Lord.” 

“You have had the strength to 
watch the congohelium and not 
to give in to it?” 

She nodded but said nothing. 

“You have been strong-willed 
enough not to go into that room?” 

“Not strong-willed, my Lord. 
I just love him, my man in 
there.” 

“You have waited, girl, for 
many months?” 

“Not all the time. I go up 

40 



the corridor when I have to eat 
or drink or sleep or do my 
personals. I even have mirrors 
and combs and tweezers and 
paint there, to make myself beau- 
tiful, the way that Sun-boy 
might want me.” 

The Lord Sto Odin looked 
over his shoulder. The music 
was low and keening with some 
emotions other than grief. The 
dancer was doing a long, slow 
dance, full of creeping and 
reaches, as he passed the congo- 
helium from one hand to the 
other. “Do you hear me, danc- 
er?” called the Lord Sto Odin, 
the Instrumentality once more 
coursing through his veins. 

The dancer did not speak nor 
seem to change his course. But 
kid-nork, kid-nork said the little 
drum, quite unexpectedly. 

“He, and the face behind him 
— they will let the girl leave if 
she really forgets him and this 
place in the act of leaving. Won’t 
you?” said Sto Odin to the danc- 
er. 

Ritiplin, rataplan said the big 
drum, which had not sounded 
since Sto Odin was let free. 

“But I don’t want to go,” said 
the girl. 

“I know you don’t want to go. 
You will go to please me. You 
can come back as soon as I haye 
done my work.” She stood mute 
so he continued. 

“One of my robots, Livius, the 

GALAXY 



one imprinted by a psychiatrist 
general, will run with you, but 
I command him to forget this 
place and all things connected 
with it. Summa nulla est. Have 
you heard me, Livius? You will 
run with this girl and you will 
forget. You will run and forget. 
You too will run and forget, 
Santuna my dear, but two Earth- 
nychtherons from now you will 
remember just enough to come 
back here, should you wish to, 
should you need to. Otherwise 
you will go to the Lady Mmona 
and learn from her what you 
should do for the rest of your 
life.” 

“You are promising, my Lord, 
that in two days and nights I 
can come back if I even feel 
like it.” 

“Now run, my girl, run. Run 
to the surface. Livius, carry her 
if you must. But run! run! run! 
More than she depends upon it.” 

Santuna looked at him very 
earnestly. Her nakedness was in- 
nocence. The gold upper eyelids 
met the black lower eyelids as 
she blinked and then brushed 
away wet tears. 

“Kiss me,” she said, “and I 
will run.” 

He leaned down and kissed 
her. 

She turned, looked back one 
last time at her dancer-lover, and 
then ran long-legged into the 
corridor. Livius ran after her, 



gracefully, untiringly. In twenty 
minutes they would be reaching 
the upper limits of the Gebiet 
“You know what I am doing?” 
said Sto Odin to the dancer. 

This time the dancer and the 
force behind him did not deign 
to answer. 

Said Sto Odin, “Water. There 
is water in a jug in my litter. 
Take me there, Flavius.” 

The robot-legionary took the 
aged and trembling Sto Odin to 
the litter. 

VIII 

T he Lord Sto Odin then per- 
formed the trick which 
changed human history for 
many centuries to come and, in 
so doing, exploded an enormous 
cavern in the vitals of the earth. 

He used one of the most secret 
ruses of the Instrumentality. 
He triple-thought. 

Only a few very adept per- 
sons could triple-think, when 
they were given every possible 
chance of training. Fortunately 
for mankind, the Lord Sto Odin 
had been one of the successful 
ones. 

He set three systems of 
thought into action. At the top 
level he behaved rationally as 
he explored the old room; at a 
lower level of his mind he plan- 
ned a wild surprise for the danc- 
er with the congohelium. But 



UNDER OtD EARTH 



41 



at the third, lowest level, he 
decided what he must do in the 
time of a single blink and trust- 
ed his autonomic nervous sys- 
tem to carry out the rest. 

These are the commands he 
gave: 

Flavius should be set on the 
wild-alert and readied for at- 
tack. 

The computer should be 
reached and told to record the 
whole episode, everything which 
Sto Odin had learned, and 
should be shown how to take 
countermeasures while Sto Odin 
gave the matter no further con- 
scious thought. The gestalt of 
action — the general frame of 
retaliation — was clear for thou- 
sandths of a second in Sto Odin’s 
mind and then it dropped from 
sight. 

The music rose to a roar. 

White light covered Sto Odin. 

“You meant me harm!” called 
Sun-boy from beyond the Goth- 
ic door. 

“I meant you harm,” Sto Odin 
acknowledged, “but it was a 
passing thought. I did nothing. 
You are watching me.” 

“I am watching you,” said the 
dancer grimly. Kid-nork, kid- 
nork went the little drum. “Do 
not go out of my sight. When 
you are ready to come through 
my door, call me or just think 
of it. I will meet you and help 
you in.” 



“Good enough,” said the Lord 
Sto Odin. 

Flavius still held him. Sto 
Odin concentrated on the melo- 
dy which Sun-boy was creating, 
a wild new song never before 
suspected in the history of the 
world. He wondered if he could 
surprise the dancer by throw- 
ing his own song back at him. 
At the same instant, his fingers 
were performing a third set of 
actions which Sto Odin’s mind 
no longer had to heed. Sto 
Odin’s hand opened a lid in 
the robot’s chest, right into the 
laminated controls of the brain. 
The hand itself changed certain 
adjustments, commanding that 
the robot should within the quar- 
ter-hour, kill all forms of life 
within reach other than the 
command -transmitter. Flavius 
did not know what had been 
done to him; Sto Odin did not 
even notice what his own hand 
had done. 

“Take me over to the old com- 
puter,” said Sto Odin to the 
robot Flavius. “I want to dis- 
cover how the strange story 
which I have just learned may 
be true.” Sto Odin kept think- 
ing of music which would even 
startle the user of the congor 
helium. 

He stood at the computer. 

His hand, responding to the 
triple-think command which it 
had been given, turned the com- 



42 



GALAXY 



puter up and pressed the button. 
Record this scene. The comput- 
er’s old relays almost grunted as 
they came to the alert and com- 
plied. 

“Let me see the map,” said 
Sto Odin to the computer. 

Far behind him, the dancer 
had changed his pace into a fast 
jog-trot of hot suspicion. 

The map appeared on the 
computer. 

“Beautiful,” said Sto Odin. 

nphe entire labyrinth had be- 
come plain. Just above 
them was one of the ancient, 
sealed-off anti-seismic shafts — 
a straight, empty tubular shaft, 
two hundred meters wide, 
kilometers high. At the top, it 
had a lid which kept out the 
mud and water of the ocean 
floor. At the bottom, since there 
was no pressure other than air 
to worry about, it had been 
covered with a plastic which 
looked like rock, so that neither 
people nor robots which might 
be passing would try to climb 
into it. 

“Watch what I am doing!” 
cried Sto Odin to the dancer. 

“I am watching,” said Sun-boy 
and there was almost a growl of 
perplexity in his sung-forth re- 
sponse. 

Sto Odin shook the computer 
and ran the fingers of his right 
hand over it and coded a very 



specific request. His left hand 
-—preconditioned by the triple- 
think, coded the emergency pan- 
el at the side of the computer 
with two simple, clear engineer- 
ing instructions. 

Sun-boy’s laughter rang out 
behind him. “You are asking 
that a piece of the congohelium 
be sent down to you. Stop! Stop, 
before you sign it with your 
name and your authority as a 
Lord of the Instrumentality. 
Your unsigned request will do 
no harm. The Central Computer 
up top will just think that it is 
some of the crazy people in the 
Bezirk making senseless de- 
mands.” The voice rose to a note 
of urgency, “Why did the ma- 
chine signal ‘received and com- 
plied with’ to you just now?” 

The Lord Sto Odin lied bland- 
ly, “I don’t know. Maybe they 
will send me a piece of the con- 
gohelium to match the one that 
you have there.” 

“You’re lying,” cried the danc- 
er. “Come over here to the door.” 

Flavius led the Lord Sto Odin 
to the ridiculous-beautiful Goth- 
ic archway. 

The dancer was leaping from 
foot to foot. The congohelium 
shone a dull alert red. The music 
wept as though all the anger and 
suspicion of mankind had been 
incorporated into a new unfor- 
gettable fugue, like a delirious 
atonal counterpoint to Johann 



UNDER OLD EARTH 



43 



Sebastian Bach’s Third Brand- 
enburg Concerto. 

“I am here.” The Lord Sto 
Odin spoke easily. 

“You are dying!” cried the 
dancer. 

“I was dying before you first 
noticed me. I set my vitality 
control to maximum after I en- 
tered the Bezirk.” 

“Come on in, then,” said Sun- 
boy, “and you will never die.” 

Sto Odin took the edge of the 
door and let himself down to 
the stone floor. Only when he 
was comfortably seated did he 
speak: 

“I am dying, that is true. But 
I would rather not come in. I 
will just watch you dance as I 
die.” 

“What are you doing? What 
have you done?” cried Sun-boy. 
He stopped dancing and walked 
over to the door. 

“Search me if you wish,” said 
the Lord Sto Odin. 

“I am searching you,” said the 
dancer, “but I see nothing but 
your desire to get a piece of the 
congohelium for yourself and to 
out-dance me.” 

At this point Flavius went 
berserk. He ran back to the lit- 
ter, leaned over, and ran toward 
the door. In each hand he car- 
ried an enormous solid-steel 
bearing. 

“What’s that robot doing?" 
cried the dancer. “I can see 

44 



your mind but you are not tell- 
ing him anything! He uses those 
steel balls to break obstruc- 
tions — ” 

He gasped as the attack came. 

Q uicker than the eye could 
follow the movement, Fla- 
vius’ sixty-ton-capacity arm 
whistled through the air as he 
flung the first steel missile di- 
rectly at Sun-boy. Sun-boy, or 
the power within him, leapt 
aside with insect speed. The ball 
plowed through two of the rag- 
clothed human bodies on the 
floor. One body said whooi\ as 
it died, but the other body let 
out no sound at all: the head 
had been tom off in first im- 
pact. Before the dancer could 
speak, Flavius flung the second 
ball. 

This time the doorway caught 
it. The powers which had im- 
mobilized Sto Odin and his ro- 
bots were back in operation. The 
ball sang as it plunged into the 
doorway, stopped in mid-air, 
sang again as the door flung it 
back at Flavius. 

The returning ball missed Fla- 
vius’ head but crushed his chest 
utterly. That was where his real 
brain was. There was a flicker 
of light as the robot went out, 
but even in dying Flavius seized 
the ball one last time and flung 
it at Sun-boy. The robot termi- 
nated operation and the heavy 



GALAXY 



ball, flung wild, caught the Lord 
Sto Odin in the right shoulder. 
The Lord Sto Odin felt pain 
until he dragged over his mani- 
kin meee and turned all pain 
off. Then he looked at the shoul- 
der. It was almost totally demol- 
ished. Blood from his organic 
body and hydraulic fluid from 
his prosthetics joined in a slow, 
heavy stream as the liquids met, 
merged and poured down his 
side. 

The dancer almost forgot to 
dance. 

Sto Odin wondered how far 
the girl had gone. 

The air pressure changed. 

“What is happening to the 
air? Why did you think about 
the girl? What is happening?” 

“Read me,” said the Lord Sto 
Odin. 

“I will dance and get my 
powers first,” said Sun-boy. 

For a few brief minutes it 
seemed that the dancer with the 
roncrohelium would cause a rock- 
fall. 

The Lord Sto Odin, dying, 
closed his eyes and found that 
it was restful to die. The blaze 
and noise of the world around 
him remained interesting, but 
had become unimportant. 

The congohelium with a thou- 
sand shifting rainbows and the 
dancer had attained near-trans- 
parency when Sun-boy came 
back to read Sto Odin’s mind. 



“I see nothing,” said Sun-boy 
worriedly. “Your vitality button 
is too high and you will die soon. 
Where is all that air com- 
ing from? I seem to hear a far- 
away roar. But you are not caus- 
ing it. Your robot went wild. 
All you do is to look at me 
contentedly and die. That is very 
strange. You want to die your 
way when you could live un- 
imaginable lives in here with 
us!” 

“That is right,” said the Lord 
Sto Odin. “I am dying my way. 
But dance for me, do dance for 
me with the congohelium, while 
I tell you your own story as you 
told it to me. It would be a 
pleasure to get the story straight 
before I die.” 

The dancer looked irresolute, 
started to dance, and then turned 
back to the Lord Sto Odin. 

“Are you sure you want to die 
right away? With the power of 
what you call the Douglas-Ou- 
yang planets, which I receive 
right here with the help of the 
congohelium, you could be com- 
fortable enough while I danced 
and you could still die when- 
ever you wished. Vitality buttons 
are much weaker than the pow- 
ers which I command. I could 
even help to lift you across the 
threshold of my door . .” 

“No,” said the Lord Sto Odin. 
“Just dance for me while I die. 
My way.”

nphus the world turned. Mil- 
-*■ lions of tons of water were 
rushing toward them. 

Within minutes the Gebiet 
and the Bezirk would drown as 
the air whistled upward. Sto 
Odin noted contentedly that 
there was an air-shaft at the top 
of the dancer’s room. He did not 
allow himself to third-think of 
what would happen when the 
matter and antimatter of the 
congohelium were immersed in 
rushing salt water. Something 
like forty megatons, he sup- 
posed, with the tired feeling of 
a man who has thought a prob- 
lem through long, long ago and 
remembers it briefly only after 
the situation has long passed. 

Sun-boy was acting out reli- 
gion before the age of space. He 
chorused hymns, he lifted his 
eyes and his hands and his piece 
of the congohelium to the sun; 
he played the rattle of whirling 
dervishes, the temple bells of the 
Man on the Two Pieces of Wood 
and the other temple bells of 
that saint who had escaped time 
simply by seeing it and stepping 
out of it. Buddha, was that his 
name? And he went on to the 
severe profanities which afflict- 
ed mankind after the Old World 
fell. 

The music kept measure. 

And the lights, too. 



Whole processions of ghostly 
shadows followed Sun-boy as he 
showed how old mankind had 
found the gods, and the sun, and 
then other gods. He pantomimed 
man’s most ancient mystery — 
that man pretended to be afraid 
of death, when it was life that 
never understood it. 

And as he danced, the Lord 
Sto Odin repeated his own story 
to him : 

“You fled the surface, Sun- 
boy, because the people were 
stupid clods, happy and dull in 
their miserable happiness. You 
fled because you could not stand 
being a chicken in a poultry 
house, antiseptically bred, safely 
housed and frozen when dead. 
You joined the other miserable, 
bright restless people who 
sought freedom in the Gebiet. 
You learned about the drugs and 
their liquors and their smokes. 
You knew their women, and 
their parties, and their games. 
It wasn’t enough. You became a 
gentleman-suicide, a hero seek- 
ing a fun-death which would 
stamp you with your individu- 
ality. You came on down to the 
Bezirk, the most forgotten and 
loathesome place of all. You 
found nothing. Just the old ma- 
chines and the empty corridors. 
Here and there a few mummies 
or bones. Just the silent lights 
and the faint murmur of air 
through the corridors.”

“I hear water now,” said the 
dancer, still dancing, “rushing 
water. Don’t you hear it, my 
dying Lord?” 

“If I did hear it, I wouldn’t 
care. Let’s get on with your 
story. You came to this room. 
The weird door made it look 
like a good place for a fun-death, 
such as you poor castaways liked 
to seek, except that there was 
not much sport in dying unless 
other people know that you did 
it intentionally, and know how 
you did it. Anyway, it was a 
long climb back up into the 
Gebiet, where your friends were, 
so yo-u slept by this computer. 

“In the night, while you slept, 
as you dreamed, the computer 
sang to you: 

T need a temporary dog 
For a temporary job 
On a temporary place 
Like earth! 

When you woke up you were 
surprised to find that you had 
dreamed an entire new kind of 
music. Really wild music which 
made people shudder with its 
delicious evil. And with the 
music, you had a job. To steal 
a piece of the congohelium. 

“You were a clever man, Sun- 
boy, before the trip down here. 
The Douglas-Ouyang planets 
caught you and made you a 
thousand times cleverer. You 
and your friends, this is what 

UNDER OLD EARTH 



you told me — or what the pres- 
ence behind you told me, just 
a half hour ago — you and 
your friends stole a subspace 
communicator console, got a fix 
on the Douglas-Ouyang planets, 
and got drunk at the sight. Iri- 
descent, luminescent. Waterfalls 
uphill. All that kind of thing. 

“And you did get the congo- 
helium. The congohelium is 
made of matter and antimatter 
laminated apart by a dual mag- 
netic grid. With that the pres- 
ence of the Douglas-Ouyang 
planets made you independent 
of organic processes. You did not 
need food or rest or even air 
or drink any more. The Douglas- 
Ouyang planets are very old. 
They kept you as a link. I have 
no idea of what they intended 
to do with Earth and with man- 
kind. If this story gets out, fu- 
ture generations will call you 
the merchant of menace, because 
you used the normal human 
appetitiousness for danger to 
trap other people with hypnotics 
and with music.” 

“I hear water,” interrupted 
Sun-boy. “I do hear water!” 

C 6 YT ever mind,” said the Lord 
’ Sto Odin, “your story is 
more important. Anyhow, what 
could you and I do about it? 
I am dying, sitting in a pool of 
blood and effluvium. You can’t 
leave this room with the congo- 



47 



helium. Let me go on. Or per- 
haps the Douglas-Ouyang entity, 
whatever it was — ” 

“Is,” said Sun-boy. 

“ — whatever it is, may just 
have been longing for sensuous 
companionship. Dance on, man, 
dance on.” 

Sun-boy danced and the drums 
talked with him, rataplan, rata- 
plan! kid-nork, kid-nork, norld 
while the congohelium made 
music scream through the solid 
rock. 

The other sound persisted. 

Sun-boy stopped and stared. 

“It is water. It is.” 

“Who knows?” said the Lord 
Sto Odin. 

“Look,” screamed Sun-boy, 
holding the congohelium high. 
“Look!” 

The Lord Sto Odin did not 
need to look. He knew full well 
that the first few tons of water, 
mud-laden and heavy, had come 
frothing down the corridor and 
into their rooms. 

“But what do 7 do?” screamed 
the voice of Sun-boy. Sto Odin 
felt that it was not Sun-boy 
speaking, but some relay speak- 
ing from the power of the Doug- 
las-Ouyang planets. A power 
which had tried to find friend- 
ship with man, but had found 
the wrong man and the wrong 
friendship. 

Sun-boy took control of him- 
self. His feet splashed in the 

48 



water as he danced. The colors 
shone on the water as it rose. 
Ritiplin, tiplin! said the big 
drum. Kid-nork, kid-nork, said 
the little drum. Boom, boom, 
doom, doom, room, said the 
congohelium. 

The Lord Sto Odin felt his 
old eyes blur but he could still 
see the blazing image, of the wild 
dancer. 

“This is a good way to die,” 
thought he, as he died.

F 'ar above, on the surface of 
the Planet, Santuna felt 
the continent itself heave be- 
neath her feet and saw the east- 
ern horizon grow dark as a 
volcano of muddy steam shot up 
from the calm blue sunlit ocean. 

“This must not, must not hap- 
pen again!” she said, thinking 
of Sun-boy and the congohelium 
and the death of the Lord Sto 
Odin. 

“Something must be done 
about it,” she added to herself. 
And she did it. 

In later centuries she brought 
disease, risk and misery back to 
increase the happiness of man. 
She was one of the principal 
architects of the Rediscovery of 
Man, and at her most famous 
she was known as the Lady Alice 
More.

Courting Time 

by TOM PURDOM 



What a grand thing it would be, if 
he were the only man in the world 
— and they were the only Group I 



I nside the great ballroom, two 
hundred guests swept around 
the floor in the vast complex pat- 
terns of Djalan Gambir’s latest 
creation, a stately, flowing varia- 
tion on the Viennese Waltz 
punctuated by variations on 
some of the less inhibited Ori- 
ental, Spanish and African 
dances. As was the custom, each 
invitation had included a learn- 
ing program, designed for home 
computers, which had taught 
each guest his role in Djalan’s 
choreography. The hospitality of 
the Zest family was elaborate, 
expensive-— and flawless. 

Verino Schell stood by the wine 
bowl trying to look brooding and 
mysterious while the other males 
his age were all out on the floor 



yelling and making erotic mo- 
tions at the girls. To fit him into 
the party at the last minute, 
Leeba Zest had unfortunately 
been forced to get him the invi- 
tation of one of her older male 
friends. Most of his partners in 
the waltzes were women old 
enough to be his mother, and 
whenever the dancing became a 
little strenuous, the program gent- 
ly eased him to the sidelines. 

His hungry eyes were locked on 
the three husbands and four 
wives of the Zest family, and the 
stocky, animated figure of Djal- 
an Gambir. He looked at Leeba 
more than he should have. All 
around him murmuring voices 
stabbed at his heart. 

“Did you hear? George says 



49 



it’s definite. They’ll announce 
Djalan’s going to marry the fam- 
ily on Sunday.” 

“I hear Rafe has a judge 
standing by. As soon as the other 
six agree — bam!” 

“John, Rafe and Kelios can’t 
wait to get somebody to take the 
girls out again. Sometimes I 
think I should have tried a group 
marriage.” 

For the first time in his life he 
was staring defeat in the face. 
For the first time in his life he 
had looked at something he 
wanted — Leeba’s body, Leeba’s 
blonde hair, Leeba’s sensitive 
face and shrewd, appraising eyes 
— and he had known with all his 
being he could never have it. 
Sometime before the end of the 
four day party Rafael Zest was 
producing here in Ibadan, Djalan 
Gambir was going to propose to 
the Zest family, and six spouses 
were going to accept with pleas- 
ure. And Leeba was going to 
acquiesce for the good of the 
family. Djalan Gambir was bet- 
ter equipped to take Gus’s place 
in the Zest group marriage, to be 
the lover and the playboy who 
gave the girls a good time, than 
any man in the Solar System. 

6 C IT ow can you have enough 
hope to even try?” Leeba 
had asked him. “We’re torment- 
ing ourselves for nothing. I’ll 
help you, but what good will it 



do? Everybody in the family 
knows you’re too involved in 
your music. Even if you were the 
kind of husband we need — don’t 
you think they know you only 
want to marry them so you can 
marry me? They aren’t stupid, 
Veri.” 

The music faded. According to 
the program, there would now 
be a half hour devoted to im- 
provisation. Most of the dancers 
bowed to their partners and 
headed for the winebowl. 

His heart pounded. He had 
noted this period when he stud- 
ied his program. 

Djalan Gambir led Margaret 
Zest onto the dance floor. On the 
balcony a small woodwind sec- 
tion shrieked the first raucous 
notes of a modern Chinese 
courting dance. Margaret put her 
hands behind her head and Djal- 
an began stamping around her in 
a wide circle. 

Verino stepped toward the 
dance floor. Unnerving images 
flashed across his consciousness. 
Djalan Gambir bedding in one 
night three women whose pleas- 
ures every sane male in the Solar 
System considered the ultimate 
in erotic experience . Djalan 
Gambir at twenty-three winning 
undying fame by descending 
alone into the terrifying atmos- 
phere and gravity of Jupiter . 
Djalan Gambir pursued by the 
women of six continents and four

space colonies . turning down 
a thousand invitations a year 
. teaching the human race 
how to dance, how to play, how 
to enjoy . 

He danced between Margaret 
and Djalan. Tossing back the 
thick conductor’s forelock he af- 
fected, he faced Djalan and 
stamped hard twice. 

The hall stirred. Dancing con- 
tests were common, but few men 
challenged the finest amateur 
dancer in the Solar System. 

If Djalan was surprised, he 
didn’t show it. He stamped back 
and bowed. Take her. Show us 
what you can do. 

Margaret smiled. Her face said 
she was revelling in the fantasy 
as much as he had guessed she 
would. In the center of a great 
stage two men were competing 
for her attention. 

She was the mother of the 
Zest family, the wife in charge 
of raising the children, and ac- 
cording to Leeba she did her 
job well not because she partic- 
ularly liked children, but because 
she had an intense compulsion 
to do something meaningful with 
her life. From the way she had 
studied him as he came down the 
reception line, he was certain she 
was intense about other things. 
She couldn’t have been more 
frank if she had asked him for 
a tape of his last sexual perform- 
ance. Small, serious, almost dull, 



as a wife of the Zest family her 
erotic experience had been vast- 
ly superior to what she might 
have enjoyed with the kind of 
husband she would have attract- 
ed if she had chosen monogamy. 

TTe clapped for faster music. 
* The dancers still on the 
floor retreated to the sidelines. 
“Hold on, Margaret!” 

“I held on to Djalan, I can 
hold on to you!” 

His arms slid around her and 
they hurtled toward the far wall 
He shouted for the wildest 
dances he knew. Cellos sang. 
Drums clattered. Brass and 
woodwind made harsh, savage 
noises. With every dance their 
bodies became less and less in 
hibited. The hall whirled around 
them like a carousel. Filling her 
consciousness with his tall form 
and laughing face, he acceler- 
ated the tempo until they were 
both moving at a pace which 
should have exhausted them, and 
then he held them there monot- 
onously, repeating one simple 
step over and over, until her head 
went back, and her smile fixed, 
and he knew he had induced 
total abandon. 

He broke the rhythm so sud- 
denly she gasped. Laughing his 
biggest laugh, whirled them down 
the hall and spun her off the end 
of his arm at Djalan Gambir. 
Djalan caught her without 

51 



COURTING TIME 



missing a beat. Soon the am- 
ateurs were doing a ballet so 
slow, intricate and beautiful Ver- 
ino the professional musician 
choked on his own pleasure. 

Behind him he heard specta- 
tors murmuring. His own per- 
formance had been crude com- 
pared to this. It didn’t matter. 
For the rest of her life, if he had 
succeeded, every time Margaret 
thought of frenzied excitement 
she would think of Verino Schell. 
Modern social dancing was a 
language and a physical pleasure, 
but it was also a drug, a stim- 
ulant and an anti-inhibitant as 
potent in expert hands as heroin 
oi alcohol. A modern expert 
could achieve in minutes the per- 
sonality changes primitive danc- 
ers had achieved only after hours 
and days. 

He approached Fileesa Zest 
during the bufet supper. She and 
John Zest, the artist, were stand- 
ing by a winebowl with half a 
dozen guests. A large, friendly 
girl, Fileesa was the Zest caree- 
woman, a first-rate historian and 
socio-economic forecaster. , He 
had met her several times at the 
Zest apartments, during the 
months when he had been giving 
Leeba private music lessons, and 
they had easily become friends. 

“Hello, Veri,” Fileesa greeted 
him. “That was quite a perform- 
ance. Do you treat all the girls 
that way?” 



J ohn Zest studied him over his 
wine glass. The rest of the 
group looked at him with polite 
curiosity. By now everyone at 
the party knew who he was and 
why he was there. 

“Only the ones I can get close 
to,” he said. “What’s the latest 
on the economic outlook?” 

“Just as dull as ever. I was just 
telling everyone it looks like the 
U.S. minimum wage will be 
twenty-seven thousand by the 
end of the year.” 

He shook his head. “Every 
time it goes up another thousand 
I get two thousand more people 
trying to join one of my choirs. 
And I’ve got more groups al- 
ready than I can handle.” 

“Can’t you organize bigger 
groups?” 

“I’ve already got two groups 
with over a thousand voices. 
When they get bigger than that 
one conductor can’t handle 
them.” 

Her eyes lit up. Locating ob- 
stacles to economic progress was 
one of her specialties. “What if 
you had better equipment? Have 
you seen Corrington’s new Com 
mand and Control unit?” 

“I’ve looked at everything on 
the market.” 

“This just went on the market 
last month.” 

A few minutes later they real- 
ized they were the only people 
left in the group. John was on

the other side of the wine bowl 
heatedly defending his theories 
about art and the others had 
all drifted away one by one. The 
conversation had gotten technical 
without either of them noticing it. 

“I’ve done it again,” Fileesa 
said. “Have I been boring you, 
too?” 

“I’m as guilty as you are.” He 
hesitated and then decided he 
could be straightforward. “You 
know I like serious talk just as 
much as you do — unlike Djalan.” 
She scowled. “Are you going to 
propose to us?” 

“Yes.” 

“You’re making a mistake.” 
“You won’t vote for me? I’ve 
been hoping you would.” 

“What about your work? You 
can’t give that up! You’re only 
beginning.” 

“I’ve thought about all that. 
Believe me — I’ve spent the last 
three months trying to make up 
my mind about this. I’ll cut back 
to composing and doing concerts 
just for the record. I’m doing 
more work than I want to any- 
way. I’d rather do less and have 
time to think about it.” 

“You’d still have to spend 
hours a day studying. Even if 
you eventually did nothing but 
record, you still need to do all 
the conducting you’re doing now. 
You need the experience. You 
could be one of the finest con- 
ductors since recording! If you 



marry us, you’ll just be a talent- 
ed amateur.” 

Kelios Zest was striding to- 
ward them across the dance floor. 

“Let’s talk about it when we’ve 
got time,” he said. “When can I 
see you alone?” 

“Leeba isn’t—” 

He turned to greet Kelios. “I’ll 
call you tomorrow.” 

TZ' elios and Terita were the 
host and hostess on the anti- 
gravity platform he was assigned 
to for the midnight ride through 
Nigeria’s famous mahogany for- 
ests. There was a big crowd 
around them — attracted by Te- 
rita — but he maneuvered into 
the inner circle without provok- 
ing more anger than he could 
joke off. 

He had seen Terita’s volup- 
tuous image hundreds of times. 
He had never met her, however, 
until they shook hands in die re- 
ception line. In person she look- 
ed oddly unpretentious, more like 
a girl you could romp with than 
a love goddess. She stayed at the 
railing and as the platform drift- 
ed over the trees she kept point- 
ing to the birds and animals and 
making exciting comments. 

By the time the four platforms 
turned back toward the hotel, he 
was standing beside her and they 
were taking turns imitating the 
wildlife they saw. He loved the 
way she laughed. When she dou- 



COURTING TIME 



53 



bled over with her arms wrapped 
around her just below her famous 
breasts, laughing with her whole 
body like a child, he almost for- 
got that on the platform just 
ahead Leeba was the hostess and 
Djalan Gambir was not quite the 
host. 

Kelios didn’t enjoy their an- 
tics. He was usually a lively, 
friendly naan, but according to 
Leeba he definitely wanted Dja- 
lan Gambir for a husband. The 
father of the family, Margaret’s 
partner in the important task of 
rearing sixteen children, Kelios 
thought the best recreation in the 
world was a book or a learning 
program; after a year and a half 
without Gus — who had died in 
a speedboat crash — he was 
looking forward to weekends 
spent in the peace and quiet of 
his study. He looked brooding 
and thoughtful throughout most 
of the ride. When Terita teased 
him about his long face, he smil- 
ed tightly and eventually moved 
to the other side of the platform. 

Leeba phoned Verino’s room 
just before he went to bed. She 
looked depressed. 

“I just had a goodnight drink 
with Teri,” he said. “I think she 
likes me.” 

“Don’t get overconfident. We’ve 
got a long way to go.” 

“Have I got Djalan worried 
yet?” 

“He never gets worried. He just 



wishes you weren’t here.” She 
shook her head. “You always 
have a good time, don’t you? I 
wish I could enjoy this.” 

“I haven’t enjoyed anything 
since the last time I touched 
you.” 

Her face softened. “I’m sorry. 
I shouldn’t have said that. If 
you couldn’t put up a good front, 
we wouldn’t stand a chance.” 
“What can I do about John, 
Rafe and Kelios?” 

“That’s what makes me feel 
helpless. If it were just the girls 
and if we had more time ... If 
I hadn’t promised you I’d try, 
and if it were somebody less re- 
sourceful than you, I’d tell you 
to go home right now.” 

T Tis arms quivered as he auto- 
matically started to reach 
out and comfort her. His body 
ached with desire. Telephones 
were among the many things love 
had made him hate. 

“I’ll think of something,” he 
said. “Don’t give up on me, Leeb. 
Put the pressure on this brain of 
mine and it always comes up 
with something.” 

“I wish I could believe you. I 
thought I’d accepted living with- 
out you, but now it looks even 
bleaker than it did. I don’t know 
if I can do it. I always thought 
emotions like that were a myth, 
but now I look at the future and 
I get cold.”

He blew her a kiss. “Go to bed. 
When we wake up tomorrow, 
we’ll know exactly what to do.” 
After she hung up he stared at 
the blank screen. He had almost 
suggested monogamy again. If 
she felt that way, perhaps he 
should have. But they had been 
over all that. Complex societies 
created complex people — and 
complex people had complex 
needs. He might be necessary, 
but so were John, Rafe and Ke- 
lios. 

He went to bed but he was too 
excited to sleep. The Zest family 
pounded on his consciousness as 
if they were voices in an unbear- 
ably complex piece of music. 

The phone woke him up just 
before noon. He answered it 
without turning on the screen. 

“Verino? Rafe Zest. Did I wake 
you up? I’m sorry. Can you come 
up to my suite?” 

He shook the sleep out of his 
brain. “Give me twenty min- 
utes.” 

“Right.” 

He got up and told the hotel 
control unit he wanted breakfast. 
He still felt over stimulated. He 
had felt this way before, but he 
couldn’t place why or when. It 
was a strange mood and it both- 
ered him. Yesterday’s events had 
been interesting, but they hadn’t 
been more inherently exciting 
than the work and pleasure which 
crowded all his days. 



Rafe had installed a portable 
command and control unit in 
front of his living room couch. 
When Verino entered the room, 
he was speaking Chinese to one 
of the screens arranged along the 
front of the cabinet. He looked 
up and waved his guest to a 
chair. Two other screens were 
blinking to let him know he had 
calls waiting. 

V erino’s Chinese was rusty. He 
thought he heard something 
about contacting the greatest liv- 
ing Chinese poet, and he caught 
the Chinese for “Let me run it 
through the computer” — which 
Rafe promptly did — but that 
was all he understood. 

This was a big year for the 
family money maker. To cele- 
brate fifty years of economic 
progress, in January the General 
Assembly had decreed that the 
year 2050 was to be a year of 
general festivity, the World Fair 
Year. For the first time in his- 
tory every man, woman and child 
alive was supposed to take a trip 
around the world. All the cities 
and nations of the Earth were 
vying for the attention of six 
billion tourists. For fifteen per- 
cent of the gross, in addition to 
his innumerable other enterprises, 
Rafe was promoting nine cities, 
including Paris and Ibadan. This 
year, for the first time, the Zest 
family income was supposed + o 



COURTING TIME 



55 



exceed one hundred million; a 
prospect which was probably of 
some importance to a man such 
as Djalan Gambir who had lived 
for twenty-two years as a per- 
petual guest. 

Rafe switched off the Chinese 
call. “I’m sorry! When I called 
you, it was quiet!” He switched 
on two screens at once and start- 
ed talking German while he 
studied the tapes coming out of 
the computer and the teletype. 

“ Aui Wiedersehen.” Rafe 
switched off the screens and 
stood up. “X calls only,” he told 
the unit. “Would you like a 
drink, Veri?” 

“I think I’ll stick to coffee.” 

Rafe stabbed a finger at the 
suite control unit. “Send out a 
pot of coffee!” He dropped the 
computer tape and instantly 
picked up a piece of sculpturer’s 
plastic which was lying on an end 
table. Even when he was rela- 
tively idle, he had to be constant- 
ly reshaping some part of the 
world. “John and Kelios and I 
had a conference this morning. 
We decided I’d better talk to 
you.” 

Verino pushed back his fore- 
lock. “What’s on your mind?” He 
still felt odd. What was bothering 
him? Why couldn’t he classify 
his own emotions? 

“Don’t think we don’t like 
you,” Rafe said. “Everybody in 
the family likes you. If we could 

56 



fit you in, we’d be proud to have 
you in the family. You’d bring 
us as much honor as John or 
Fileesa. You haven’t accomplish- 
ed what they have, but you will. 
It shows.” He held the plastic in 
front of his chest and squeezed it 
flat between his palms. “You 
can’t get us to marry you by 
coming here and turning your 
charm on the girls. We need a 
certain kind of person and you 
don’t fit the equation. If we let 
you try to take Gus’s place, it 
would be the biggest mistake you 
or we ever made.” 

“I’ve thought about that — ” 

CtT know what you told Fileesa. 

She agrees with me. In a 
year you’d be working as hard 
as ever. You can’t help it. And 
what happens to us? Do you 
think I want a wife nagging me 
to take her out when I’ve got a 
big project accelerating? Because 
the guy that took Gus’s place has 
a big concert this weekend?” 
Verino’s heart jumped violent- 
ly. His eyes widened. Leeba! He 
had felt this way the morning 
after the night he first met Lee- 
ba! 

“Do you think Fileesa wants 
a husband who’ll be busy when 
she decides it’s time she let her- 
self go and had a fling? We chose 
group marriage to get away from 
that kind of thing.” 

Verino stood up. On the cabi- 

GALAXY 



net screens were blinking. 
Through the window he could 
see the fantastic shapes of new 
hotel and apartment buildings 
rising above the forest — build- 
ings that wouldn’t have been 
there if it hadn’t been for Rafe 
and the family that supported 
Rafe. 

It was incredible! No wonder 
he hadn’t understood his own 
feelings! 

“You don’t understand,” he 
said. “I’m in love. You can’t rea- 
son with love. You can say yes 
or no, but you can’t reason with 
it.” 

“That’s another thing. Leeba — ” 

He threw up his hands. An im- 
mense choir towered above his 
head. Thousands of voices, sev- 
en soloists — eight! include Gus 
— all the joyous, triumphant, 
complex life of the Twenty-First 
Century . the wealth . the 
planets . mankind confound- 
ing the pessimists and mastering 
the challenge created by its own 
inventiveness . men and wom- 
en developing personalities and 
institutions complex enough to 
match the complexities of the en- 
vironment men and women had 
created . 

“Not Leeba! You! Your fam- 
ily! The Twenty-First Century!” 

Rafe stared at him as if he’d 
suddenly gone crazy. 

He backed toward the door. 
Nothing he could say could ex- 



press it. Hallellujahs thundered 
in his brain. They would hear 
what he was hearing! They would 
feel what he was feeling! 

“Where are you going?” Rafe 
yelled at his back. “What’s 
wrong with you? We can’t marry 
you!” 

nphe jet back to Cleveland was 
crowded with tourists but he 
hardly noticed. Dictating furious- 
ly, on fire with emotion, he piec- 
ed together the music he needed 
from his memory and from the 
libraries he could contact from 
the plane. Wherever he had to, 
he altered it and wrote connect- 
ing passages. He didn’t have time 
to write anything original. Even 
if he’d had the time, no com- 
poser who had ever lived could 
have written what he wanted. 

The Corrington people were 
efficient. The Command and 
Control unit he had ordered from 
the plane was waiting for him in 
his rehearsal hall. He sat down 
at the console and started to 
work. The computer gave him a 
cost estimate, including transpor- 
tation, in less than four minutes. 
Assuming he only had to pay the 
soloists, and half the other voices 
would pay him, his credit balance 
would just cover it. 

He put the computer to work 
making reservations. While it was 
doing that, he vocally program- 
med it to hunt down the soloists

he wanted, and to contact the 
people who would help him as- 
semble the two thousand voices 
he needed. As Fileesa had told 
him, the unit could take raw 
information and deliver it to any 
person in the world with what- 
ever psychological coloring the 
operator ordered. 

Time was a raging monster 
gnawing at his back. He rehears- 
ed until his body ached and the 
scores blurred in front of the per- 
formers’ eyes. Half the choir 
thought he needed a psych check- 
up; singers stamped out pro- 
claiming the project was impos- 
sible; effects which were child’s 
play for the individual performer 
had to be coordinated by the 
conductor with hands, feet and 
elbows — and by Saturday night 
two thousand voices rang with 
the passion and energy of his vi- 
sion. 

“This will be one of the mar- 
vels of the Fair,” he told them 
just before they left for Ibadan. 
“It may be one of the events of 
the century. You’ll be watching 
tapes of it for the rest of your 
lives.” 

Their faces said they believed 
him. He might be mad, but he 
was the kind of madman people 
followed. 

The climax of the Zest party 
was the most elaborate enter- 
tainment Djalan Gambir had ever 
created, a long variation on Ro- 



meo and Juliet, in costume, and 
with parts for every guest. Be- 
fore the day ended, every family 
friend and hanger-on would re- 
ceive a total escape into fantasy, 
all the fighting, drinking, loving, 
pageantry and tragedy any hum- 
an psyche could possibly need. 

/An. the roof of the hotel, mill- 
^ ing through a detailed re- 
creation of a section of Verona, 
the guests were beginning to im- 
merse themselves in the fantasy. 
The gravity had been reduced 
by ten per cent, just enough to 
make the oldest muscles feel 
fresh and youthful, and in the 
middle of the crowd John Zest 
and a dozen other men were en 
ergetically imitating the brawling 
Montagues and Capulets. 

Leeba pointed her fan at the 
horizon. “What’s that?” 

Rafe followed her arm. “By 
my troth!” His hand leaped to 
his sword hilt. By his usual en- 
thusiasm he had become a Ren- 
aissance gallant the moment he 
stepped into the afternoon sun. 
“Verino! Now what?” 

Leeba covered her open mouth 
with her hand. All over the mock 
city people turned to look. John 
and his companions noticed the 
commotion and stopped hacking 
each other long enough to see 
what was happening. Djalan and 
Rafe exchanged ominous glances. 

A flock of anti-gravity plat- 



58 



GALAXY 



forms was drifting toward the 
roof. At the center of a moving 
amphitheatre four platforms high, 
alone on a platform of his own, 
Verino Schell stood behind some 
kind of control unit and his long 
arms moved in time with a full 
orchestra and the soft moaning 
of thirty choirs. 

The platforms encircled the 
roof. The Renaissance lords and 
ladies looked up and chattered 
excitedly. Erect and solemn, Ve- 
rino floated above the crowd to 
the exact center of the roof. 

Rafe marched through the 
crowd and pointed his sword at 
Verino. “What is this, Verino? 
Who gave you the — ” 

Verino threw out his arm. A 
single tenor voice speared the 
afternoon. The chorus moaned 
frantically. 

‘Tf you don’t leave, we’ll call 
the police!” 

Verino’s arms leaped out. He 
told the control unit something 
and lights flashed on the cabi- 
net. One after another seven 
voices announced their presence. 

Rafe shook his sword. Leeba 
gasped and looked up with sud- 
den comprehension. The eight 
voices interwove in complex, un- 
expected patterns, each one sing- 
ing a song of its own. Verino 
kicked a pedal in the bottom of 
the control unit and the choir 
sprang into life. Suddenly the 
air was full of Bach, The Heav- 



ens Laugh, The Earth Rejoices. 

Leeba ran forward and grabbed 
Rafe’s arm. “It’s us. Listen to it! 
Listen!” 

Djalan Gambir tightened his 
grip on Margaret’s arm. “He told 
Rafe he loves us,” Margaret 
whispered. “It’s incredible.” 

Rafe lowered his sword. “What 
good will it do?” Twelve feet 
above his head the thunder of 
the gods mingled with the noise 
of six billion people rejoicing in 
their luck — and four men and 
women led the celebration. 

“Listen to him anyway!” Lee- 
ba yelled. “Give him that much! 
Look what he’s done for us!” 

“We can’t marry him. We’ll 
stir ourselves up for nothing.” 

r T~'he music roared on. Awed and 
-*• subdued, the Zest family 
stared at the gigantic mirror Ve- 
rino had created. They wanted 
him to stop and they couldn’t 
turn away. Beside the reality 
beating on their ears, the mas- 
querade on the roof suddenly 
seemed empty. 

In all their years of careful, 
trained listening, nothing like this 
had ever assaulted their emo- 
tions. To create the right expres- 
sion for his vision, Verino had 
collaborated with the masters of 
ten centuries. Sullivan’s Celebra- 
tion for Universal Disarmament; 
the Ode to Joy from Beethoven’s 
last symphony; the masses and 



COURTING TIME 



59 



requiems of Bach, Brahms, Vi- 
valdi and Berlioz; the great mu- 
sic created during this last half 
century, when the human race 
had finally been liberated from 
drudgery and ignorance — he had 
put it all together in a work so 
complex and awesome it was as 
if all those generations had la- 
bored with this moment in mind. 
He was showing them what they 
were. He had hung the Twenty- 
First Century in the sky. 

Shortly after sundown, hours 
after the storm had appeared on 
the horizon, all the platforms ex- 
cept Verino’s began to float to- 
ward the stars. Bits and pieces of 
music mingled as if representa- 
tives of all the centuries had ap- 
peared in the heavens. High in 
the air, just as the last platform 
faded from view, the music 
reached a far off climax. 

Verino bowed to his audience. 
Even in the flickering torchlight 
he could see he had overpowered 
them. Terita was actually sob- 
bing. On the edge of the roof 
Rafe was shaking his head. 

Fileesa stood up and applaud- 
ed. Rafe stood up with her, and 
then John and Kelios. Everyone 
on the roof was applauding! The 
noise rolled up to him as if they 
were two thousand instead of two 
hundred. 

A strange cry touched the edge 
of his consciousness. Something 
shiny flew at him through the 



torchlight. He ducked and metal 
clattered on the platform behind 
him. 

All over the roof women 
screamed. Djalan Gambir ran 
out of the crowd and leaped at 
the platform. His fingers gripped 
the edge and held. 

Verino stared at the clutching 
fingers. He looked back and saw 
a sword lying beside the control 
unit. 

Djalan swung himself forward 
and then somersaulted backward 
and leaped onto the platform. 
Rage distorted his face. He pull- 
ed his sword from its scabbard 
and charged. 

Verino threw up his hands. A 
vivid picture of Djalan descend- 
ing toward Jupiter in a tiny, 
cramped sphere flashed across 
his mind. Djalan had risked his 
life so he could rise from ob- 
scurity to world fame and now 
he was willing to risk death and 
imprisonment for the Zest for- 
tune. Years of pleasant living 
hadn’t changed his basic person- 
ality. 

T'Yjalan lunged and Verino hop- 
ped out of the way. Down 
below he could hear all the com- 
motion of a general panic. John, 
Rafe and Kelio were running 
toward the platform. Fileesa was 
screaming like a lunatic. 

He grabbed the sword Djalan 
had thrown at him. 



60 



GALAXY 



Djalan growled and lunged. 
Verino jumped back and raised 
the long, unwieldy Renaissance 
weapon to something resembling 
the on guard position. He had 
never handled a sword or a 
fencing foil in his life. 

Djalan lunged again. Verino 
hacked at the oncoming blade. 
Steel slithered along steel. The 
hard, brutal -looking point missed 
his chest by half an inch. 

“You’ll go to jail, Djalan!” 

“I’ll kill you.” 

Djalan lunged. Verino parried 
clumsily and saw the other point 
slide under his blade and plunge 
toward his stomach. He leaped 
back three feet before he knew 
what had happened. Djalan 
stamped forward and lunged 
again. 

The platform tilted. Verino 
lurched to one side. Holding his 
sword with both hands, he beat 
down Djalan’s blade. His heart 
was thumping with panic. Hands 
were clinging to the end of the 
platform, but the others weren’t 
as athletic as Djalan. 

He pressed Djalan’s blade 
against the platform. For a mo- 
ment they glared at each other. 
“This is ridiculous! What are you 
trying to do?” 

Djalan jumped back and freed 
his sword. The platform lurched 
again. Verino stumbled and Dja- 
lan stepped forward and lunged. 

Rafe came over the side of the 



platform. Something hard thud- 
ded on Verino’s head and neck. 
His sword fell out of his hand. 
He moaned and toppled over. 

ttTt’s the only solution,” Rafe 
A said. For once the Solar 
System’s leading entrepemeur 
didn’t look enthusiastic. “It’s ex- 
pensive and I’m not happy with 
it — a ten spouse family is get- 
ting unwieldy — but you forced 
us into it. Nobody wants to give 
either of you up. Even the girls 
won’t give Djalan up after he 
risked going to jail for us. I’m 
certain Djalan thought about 
that, of course. He claims he was 
overcome by passion.” He shook 
his head. “Are you sure you two 
didn’t plan this?” 

“If you’d seen that point com 
ing toward you,” Verino said, 
“you wouldn’t ask that. Have 
you picked out the girl yet?” 
Rafe grinned. “There’s a girl it 
my office in Benares that John 
and I have been eyeing for 
months. The girls don’t exactly 
like somebody that young joining 
the group, but they know they 
can’t argue. The competition will 
do them good. You’ll see. Married 
life is no party.” 

“Will it be a triple wedding?’’ 
“Right. In two weeks. Do you 
think you can work up the music 
for us?” 

Verino stared out the window 
at the mahogany forest. “Sure ”

“Isn’t it enough time? You did 
the other thing in two days.” 
Two weeks . Was he doing 
the right thing? Suppose his emo- 
tions weren’t as strong as he had 
thought they were? What about 
that blonde in his chamber chor- 
us who had been making eyes at 
him for the last few months? 

He hardly knew these people! 



“It’s fine, Rafe. Plenty of 
time.” 

He stuck his hands in hi» 
pockets so Rafe couldn’t see they 
were shaking. If it had been hap- 
pening to someone else, he would 
have laughed. Ten minutes after 
his proposal had been accepted, 
and he had the bridegroom jit- 
ters. TOM PURDOM

A couple of years ago a rather astonishingly good complete short 
science-fiction novel came in, and when we printed it we made the pre- 
diction that it might well win science fiction's annual award of merit, the 
Hugo. As it turned out, we were right: The story was Jack Vance's The, 
Drag on Masters, and it, with its lovely illustrations by Jack Gaughan, dec- 
orated our August, 1962 issue. 

Now we have a new one by Vance coming up in our next. The name 
of it is The Last Castle, and it takes place right here on Earth — but on 
an Earth in the very remote future, where the strongpoints of humanity are 
immense castles, each with its surrounding square miles of feudal territory; 
where men have developed strange alliances and antagonisms with the 
Meks, the Birds — and each other. In every story Jack Vance writes, there 
is poetry and color. This is no exception. 

Is it as good as The Dragon Masters? 

We'll say this much — it is very, very good. As to the rest, why not 
come around next issue and see for yourself? 

Of course, we'll have the usual array of additional stories and de- 
partments to back it up — a fine novelette by Frank Herbert called The 
Primitives, another by Robert Silverberg called Lazarus Come Forth!, fea- 
tures by Algis Budrys and Willy Ley . 

We think April, 1966, will be a good issue — and, as a matter of 
fact, we think 1966 is going to be full of good issuesl

BY WILLY LEY 

The Wreck of 
LA LUTINE 

I t was the Year VIII of the 
French Republic, and aH 
of Europe (where the same year 
was called 1799 A.D.) was try- 
ing to recover from the wars 
they had fought against this re- 
public. Italy had been over- 
whelmed by the French. The 
areas now known as Belgium and 
The Netherlands were ruled by 



63 



the French too and Prussia and 
Austria, as well as Spain, had 
been forced to sign peace trea- 
ties they did not like at all. 

The only major power in 
western Europe that had not 
been defeated was Great Britain. 
In fact, in some respects it was 
better off in the “Year VIII” 
than it had been when the 
French Republic had been foun- 
ded. The British fleet had de- 
feated the French whenever they 
met, Great Britain’s colonial 
possessions had grown by an- 
nexing former French colonies 
and, while the French had 
fought battles all over the map 
of Europe, the British had ex- 
tended their trade and achieved 
general prosperity. 

One other place was prosper- 
ous too, the independent seaport 
of Hamburg. 

Hamburg had been a seaport 
ever since it had been founded. 
While it had never been poverty 
stricken, it had not become im- 
portant until (and because of) 
the American Revolutionary 
War. Some quirk of commercial 
fate had channelled lots of trade 
through Hamburg because the 
Thirteen Colonies wanted to be 
independent. The many wars 
against revolutionary France had 
brought additional trade to 
Hamburg and while Hamburg’s 
commercial interests had been 
opposed to those of Great Brit- 



ain in 1776 and for a few yean 
after, both now pulled the same 
commercial rope. 

Hamburg got all the trade 
that would have gone to Holland 
under normal conditions. But 
there was a problem: the avail- 
able cash did not match the in- 
crease of the trade volume. 

It is reported that the banks 
had to charge an interest rate 
of 30 per cent for loans, which 
was about equal to the profits 
the merchants would have made 
if they had had enough cash on 
hand. But the sea captains that 
carried the merchandise — most 
of them Scandinavians — want- 
ed to be paid. And while the lo- 
cal .banks could get almost any 
interest rate they charged, they 
were handicapped by lack of 
cash too. Logically the mer- 
chants of Hamburg sent out a 
cry for help to the bankers of 
London. And the latter were 
only too pleased to help; it was 
a clear-cut case of one hand 
washing the other. 

The London bankers, in a very 
short time, got the sum of 24 
million dollars together. Most of 
it was in gold coins, the remain- 
der consisted of bars of gold 
and silver which the City of 
Hamburg could use to mint their 
own coin. The problem was to 
get the treasure to Hamburg. 

While there was no longer a 
French fleet there were still 



64 



GALAXY 



French ships prowling the North 
Sea and the Channel. A com- 
mercial vessel traveling under 
military escort would only at- 
tract attention. The Londoners 
decided on using a vessel which 
they had captured from the 
French a few years earlier. It 
was a fast-sailing and heavily 
armed warship named La Lutine 
— the English had not even 
bothered to change the name. 
The gold and silver were quietly 
loaded in barrels and boxes 
which did not betray their con- 
tents by their appearance. The 
cargo might as well have been 
so many barrels of salted her- 
ring and boxes of soap. 

L a Lutine carried the unusu- 
ally large crew of 300 men, 
many of them armed to repel 
a possible enemy attack. She was 
ready to sail early in October 
1799. The captain waited for a 
few days for good weather and 
cast off a few hours after sun- 
set on October 9 th. 

The weather was good, the 
wind was favorable and by mid- 
night the ship — which had 
sailed from Yarmouth, the east- 
ernmost point of England — had 
covered more than half the dis- 
tance. But then a strong storm 
came from the northeast, blow- 
ing in the direction of Holland. 

Several hours later the storm- 
blown ship reached the string 



of islands to the north of Hol- 
land — presumably its original 
coastline — and ran aground 
near the island of Terschel- 
ling. La Lutine capsized im- 
mediately and sank. Only two 
of its large crew survived. 

The merchants of Hamburg 
must have managed somehow to 
survive their financial crisis. 
The merchants and bank- 
ers of London quietly approach- 
ed Lloyd’s of London, which 
had insured vessel and cargo, 
and collected. And the two sur- 
viving sailors spread the tale of 
the gold. 

The government of the Bata- 
vian Republic — which was the 
name of Holland at the moment 
— acted promptly by declaring 
that the treasure on board the 
sunken vessel was government 
property. But that is the only 
action the government took; for 
some reason nobody was in a 
hurry. 

Two years later an order was 
issued to try and salvage the 
money. This order went to the 
local authorities and they ascer- 
tained that the wreck was ac- 
cessable at low tide. Hence local 
fishermen were sworn in and 
told .to see what they could do. 
The fishermen went to work 
with oyster forks and long-han- 
dled nets and succeeded in ex- 
tracting about a million dollars 
worth of gold bars and coins

during the summer and fall of 
1801. But during the winter 
1801-02 currents shifted and in 
the spring of 1802 La Lutine 
was no longer visible. In fact 
she had been covered up with 
a layer of sand estimated to have 
been 50 or 60 feet in thickness. 

In 1814 Napoleon was finally 
defeated. Peace was established 
and with it a new Kingdom of 
the Netherlands, ruled by Wil- 
lem Frederik of Orange who 
called himself Willem I. Of 
course he knew the story of La 
Lutine but seems to have been 
convinced all along that salvage 
was impossible. When approach- 
ed by a group of Dutch mer- 
chants and bankers in 1821 he 

66 



chartered a “Privileged Salvage 
Company” without hesitation, 
merely stipulating that one half 
of everything recovered was to 
be handed over to the crown. 

While the new company sent 
experienced men to Terschelling 
to study the situation and to 
make recommendations about 
the procedure to be followed, 
Lloyd’s of London and the fi- 
nancial community felt glum. 
The war was over. The gold on 
board La Lutine was British 
gold. And even though it was 
located in Dutch waters they had 
hoped to get it back one day. 

They petitioned their king — 
George IV — who approached 
Willem I. 

Willem wanted to show that 
he was England’s friend and did 
not really believe that the trea- 
sure could be salvaged. The 
thing to do was to issue an edict 
that the money on board of La 
Lutine was British Crown Prop- 
erty. George IV, in turn, con- 
ferred the property to Lloyd’s, 
and Lloyd’s made an arrange- 
ment with the Privileged Sal- 
vage Company which now repre- 
sented British interests. But the 
signing of the various documents 
was the only thing that did 
happen; La Lutine was buried 
under a layer of sand that 
seemed to grow thicker every 
year. 

From 1823, the year the trans- 

GALAXY 



fer of the property had taken 
place, until 1857 nothing hap- 
pened at all. The “asset” of 
about 23 million dollars in gold 
_ could not be approached. But 
in 1857 the currents shifted 
again. Now the sea began to take 
away the sand it had piled up 
for half a century. In 1858 the 
wreck became actually accessi- 
ble and men wearing the newly 
invented diving suits went to 
work. 

^Tphey happened to have access 
-*• to the place where the gold 
bars had been stored, and within 
three months they recovered 
half a million dollars worth. 
But then came the winter and 
a new shift of currents. In 
Spring 1859 the wreck was cov- 
ered with sand again, but the 
layer was only a few feet thick 
and the divers thought that they 
could continue, at least in a few 
places around the wreck. For a 
while they were right. During 
1859 and I860 they recovered 
another one and a half million 
dollars worth of gold. But die 
sand layer grew in thickness and 
by the end of 1860 the work 
was discontinued. 

But this was also the time 
when a new profession, the en- 
gineer, was in the ascendancy. 
Engineers are naturally of the 
opinion that obstacles can be 
overcome by good engineering. 



After all, they had invented a 
workable diving suit and mean- 
while they had also invented 
dredging devices with buckets 
on endless chains. Such “digging 
ladders” as they were called, 
steam-powered, of course, should 
be able to do the job. The me- 
chanical diggers would remove 
the sand and then the divers 
would be able to do the fine 
work and remove the gold. 

Operation Steam Dredge got 
underway in 1866. 

The concept had been correct, 
it was merely a case of the 
currents being stronger. Also the 
currents worked twenty - four 
hours a day all year round, 
while the dredging operation 
worked only in summer and in 
good weather. The result of 
seven years of work consisted 
of 20,000 dollars in gold coins. 

It was disheartening and the 
only solace consisted in the sure 
knowledge that the treasure was 
there. The Privileged Salvage 
Company did not chase a rumor 
that might or might not be true, 
it just battled difficulties that 
might diminish again. And, after 
all, the engineers built new ma- 
chines all the time. At some time 
better machinery and better con- 
ditions would come together. 

Every year a new attempt was 
made but the success was negli- 
gible; the salvaged precious met- 
al paid only a few per cent of

67 



the cost. In 1900 the company- 
declared officially that it no 
longer considered the venture 
possible and asked to be released 
from its contract. 

The financial circles of Lon- 
don remained optimistic, and 
one can hardly differ. 

It was a fact that there were 
over 20 million dollars in gold 
left in the wreck. The depth of 
the water was virtually negligi- 
ble any good diver could put 
in three to four hours of work 
at that depth. The sand was the 
only problem and where the 
digging ladders had failed suc- 
tion pumps ought to be success- 
ful. 

A firm specializing in such 
work, the “National Salvage As- 
sociation”, felt certain of both 
its financial strength and its en- 
gineering ability and offered a 
contract to Lloyd’s and to the 
Dutch Company. It said, in 
substance, that the National Sal- 
vage Association would salvage 
the treasure of La Lutine at its 
own expense and would keep 70 
per cent of the gold recovered, 
15 per cent would go to Lloyd’s 
and 15 per cent to the Dutch 
group. 

Since the Dutch group had 
given up hope, even 15 per cent 
was a windfall it would mean 
three million dollars if the Brit- 
ish actually recovered the trea- 
sure. The managers of Lloyd’s 



reasoned the same way and both 
signed the contract. 

The National Salvage Associ- 
ation did not waste money on 
trying what had been tried be- 
fore. It was ridiculous that div- 
ers spend time under water try- 
ing to pick out single coins 
from the sand. The job of the 
divers was obviously to guide 
the machinery that would do all 
the actual work. 

A n available steamship was 
adapted for the specific 
job of recovering La Lutine' s 
gold. A large wire-mesh cage 
was built at the stern of the sal- 
vage vessel, overhanging the 
stern for a distance of about 15 
feet. A large pipe that could be 
lengthened or shortened and 
that had a diameter of about 
two feet, was attached amidships. 
Underwater electric lamps were 
hanging from cables to provide 
illumination for the divers, and 
hooks and grapples also hung 
overboard so that the divers 
could attach heavy objects — 
say a money barrel that was 
still intact — to be hoisted 
aboard. (A few gun barrels, an 
anchor and the ship’s bell were 
salvaged that way.) But the 
main plan of action relied on 
the pipe which was connected 
with a powerful suction pump. 
The water and sand sucked up 
through that pipe was conveyed 



68 



GALAXY 




Fig. 2. Contemporary drawing of the attempts of salvaging the treasure of La Lutine 
before the first World War. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 




into the wire-mesh cage at the 
stem of the vessel. The water 
and the sand would thereby be 
discharged into the sea, but 
anything else, especially loose 
coins, would stay in the cage, 
to be collected at intervals. It 
was all very carefully thought 
out: the suction pump would 
gradually “excavate” the wreck 
so that the divers could go to 
work in the ship’s interior and 
all incidental salvage was purely 
mechanical. 

The work began in 1911 and 
everything looked promising. 

There had been only one un- 
known factor and that was the 
amount of sand that the current 
would deposit on and around 
the wreck. It turned out that the 
current carried more sand per 
hour than the suction pump 
could remove. 

Well, if the current was the 
real culprit there was still an- 
other way. One could change the 
path of the current and one did 
not even need new equipment. 

If a channel at the bottom of 
the shallow sea provided a short 
cut for the flow of the current, 
no new sand would be deposited 
on the wreck. It was even possi- 
bile that some sand would be 
removed. After carefully check- 
ing the path of the current and 
studying all the associated prob- 
lems the solution emerged. 

It would need a channel run- 



ning in a certain direction 
which had to be slightly over 
6000 feet long. The channel 
would also have to be fairly 
deep, so that the total amount 
of sand to be moved would, be 
about iy 2 million tons. But the 
suction pump on board the sal- 
vage vessel could handle the 
job, if given time. 

Unfortunately the weather was 
generally bad in the area all 
through 1912 so that the total 
number of hours during which 
the vessel could work was just 
about 300. But in the spring of 
1913 the job was finished and 
all the calculations had been 
proved correct. 

After the channel had been 
finished the wreck of La Lutine 
could be exposed quickly. By 
July 1913 the midship section 
was accessable and the divers 
reported that there was a gap 
in the hull. It was too small to 
enter but the divers could reach 
in and feel around and they 
were sure that they felt stacked 
bars of metal. The next step was, 
obviously, that the gap had to 
be widened so that the divers 
would be able to enter the hold 
of the ship and do the job for 
which everything else had been 
only preliminaries. 

Several days later the divers 
went back to the wreck, this 
time equipped with tools to wid- 
en the hole, trailing cables for 



70

hoisting the treasure aboard the 
salvage vessel. 

A sight they tried not to be- 
lieve greeted them. Of course 
the removal of the sand had 
created a hollow in the bottom 
. and the wreck had turned 
and slid into the hollow, with 
the gap in the hull at the bot- 
tom! 

I don’t know whether com- 
pressed air drills existed in 
1913. They would have been the 
tool to use under the circum- 
stances all that had to be done 
was to make a sufficiently large 
hole in the undamaged side of 
the hull that was then topmost. 
Of course the National Salvage 
Association did not tell in fine 
detail just what they did — no 
use giving pointers to competi- 
tors. At any event they resumed 
work during the spring of 1914, 
without issuing any statements 
except the obvious one in Au- 
gust 1914 that operations would 
be suspended for the duration 
of the war. 

To everybody’s surprise work 
was not resumed after the first 
World War, or if anything was 
done it must have been on such 
a minor scale that the news- 
papers did not say anything. 

To the best of my knowledge 
the 20 million dollars in gold 
are still there — I shall refrain 
from paging Arthur C. Clarke 



at this point. One discovery of 
sunken treasure is enough per 
person. Besides, the gold of La 
Lutine does not need to be dis- 
covered. Even if currents of the 
sea should have shifted the po- 
sition of the wreck it must be 
in an area corresponding to 
about a city block. 

The two remaining questions 
are whether the recovery will 
still be worthwhile and how we 
would go about it nowadays. 

The first question can be an- 
swered relatively easily. Gold 
coins worth 20 million dollars 
in 1900 would be worth about 
40 million dollars now — just 
considered as metal, that is. If 
the pieces were in new condition 
when they were loaded aboard 
the ship they would have a stiH 
higher value as collector’s items, 
let’s say about 110 million dol- 
lars. 

As the finds of perfectly 
preserved Spanish doubloons in 
sunken ships just south of Cape 
Kennedy have proved once 
more, gold coins do not deteri- 
orate in sea water. 

In short, the salvage of the 
hoard of La Lutine would be 
worthwhile if the salvage opera- 
tions can be carried out for less 
than 50 million dollars of cur- 
rent purchasing power. Whether 
that can be done would depend 
on the thickness of the sand 
layer on the wreck right now 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION

and the distance in feet from 
the surface of the North Sea at 
high tide to the wreck. 

A modern salvage operation 
would probably try to keep the 
currents away from the wreck 
by building a wall around it. 
It would be quite similar to any 
dam - building operation, by 
dropping blocks of anything 
that is cheap and will not float. 
Once the wreck has been walled 
in there are two possibilities. 

The more intriguing one 
would be to build up this wall 
to a few feet above high-tide 
level, making the wall water- 
proof with sheets of bitumen and 
concrete and pumping out the 
“well” so that salvage workers 
can go to work. But this would 
be the more expensive solution 
— and this also happens to be 
an area where storm-driven 
floods grow ten or twelve feet 
taller than normal high tide. 

But one can work very nicely 
under water, if the water is quiet 
and not too deep. Of all the 
known sunken treasure ships the 
famous La Lutine rests at the 
shallowest depth. And a wall 
around the wreck would keep 
the water quiet. Maybe there 
are some people sitting around 
right now in Amsterdam or in 
London thinking about salvage. 

ven if there aren’t, it is still 
possible that the Dutch 



will salvage the treasure of La 
Lutine as a by-product of an- 
other project. The string of 
islands along the Dutch coast, 
collectively known as the West 
Frisian Islands, indicates, as has 
been said, the original coastline. 
The portion of the North Sea 
between this string of islands 
and the mainland is known as 
the Waddenzee and is quite 
shallow, though it is made diffi- 
cult by fast-flowing currents. 
Ever since Dutch engineers suc- 
ceeded in recovering the area 
covered for centuries by the 
Zuider Zee, another set of Dutch 
engineers and scientists has been 
dreaming about dams from Den 
Helder on the mainland to the 
island of Texel, then a dam from 
Texel to the next island (Vlie- 
land), then one between Vlie- 
land and Terschelling, one from 
Terschelling to Ameland and 
finally one from Ameland to the 
mainland. 

At the moment this is not even 
a project, in spite of (or possi- 
bly because of) cost estimates 
that have been made. But even- 
tually it will be done. And after 
it has been done La Lutine will 
become accessible again. And 
her gold may help to amortize 
the cost of the dam-building 
project a little bit faster than 
cautious actuaries, who have to 
ignore such possibilities, have 
calculated. — WILLY LEY

The wars were long oyer, 
but something remained of 
all their noisy strife — 




by THOMAS M. DISCH 



A single mote of red dust 
drifted down upon the 
sampler-to-be, and Old Sally 
Ivanov blew it away with a sin- 
gle imprecation of one syllable. 
The older women of the Mars 
colonies used such words as freely 
as their men, but eight-year-old 
Ilisiveta was more offended than 
words could tell. More, anyhow, 
than she was willing for her 
words to tell. The proprieties 
evolve swiftly at the frontier, 
and the second and third genera- 
tions, not having occasion to 



match the strength of the first 
pioneers, exceed them in virtue. 
Ilisiveta made a mental note to 
tell her mother that Grandmoth- 
er had used “that word” again 
and returned to the task at 
hand — a Pennsylvania Dutch 
apron upon which she was tat- 
ting a number of square orange 
flowers. 

She was bored, oh how she 
was bored! It was Sunday after- 
noon, the very dullest hour of 
the dullest day of the week, and 
Ilisiveta couldn’t even suit-up 



73 




for an hour’s play out-of-locks 
because of the tempest — the 
tempest! 

Her grandmother was bent 
over the utility table, squinting 
at a piece of nylon on which 
she was tracing free-hand, a 
Moorish arabesque from a photo- 
stat made at the Jefferson Li- 
brary. The red shadows of the 
dust storm formed their own 
more masterful arabesques upon 
the white field of the cloth, as 
the squalls of grit continued to 
beat against the dome of Nevsky 
Colony. It had been going on 
like this for three days now. 

“Close the wall, Ilisa,” the old 
woman commanded. 

Ilisiveta rose and went to the 
power panel recessed in the 
short hallway (which at night 
converted into her own bed- 
room) and flicked on the Wall- 
South switch. The Nightlight 
knob above, controlling intensi- 
ty and tone, was preset to 
her grandmother’s preference: 
White, Bright. Instantly the wall 
which the dome of the colony 
had been visible became opaque, 
and the ceiling lighted up. 

“Where does all the dust come 
from?” Old Sally asked rhe- 
torically. “It can’t get in through 
the airlocks, so where does it 
come from?” 

“People bring it in on their 
suits,” Ilisiveta explained indul- 
gently; but her grandmother 



seemed not to have heard at all. 
She was erasing one of the lines 
of the arabesque, which had 
swerved off un-Moorishly in 
order to avoid another speck of 
dust. 

“If you used the projector, 
Grandmother — ” Ilisiveta began. 

“If I used the projector, 
Granddaughter, it wouldn’t be 
handicraft.” 

T T andicraft! Ilisiveta gave an 
audible sigh. Embroidery 
and ceramics and such were good 
enough for old pension-women 
who had done their thirty-years’ 
service for the colony or borne 
six children. But was it for little 
girls who had four hours of 
homework still ahead of them 
on Sunday afternoon? Who 
would be much happier diddling 
with their own designs, however 
crude, instead of copying these 
dull patterns from old books? 
Who might have been out-of- 
locks playing, if it weren’t for 
the dreary, the eternal Martian 
dust storm? 

No, Ilisiveta concluded in si- 
lence, it wasn’t. 

“My eyes hurt ...” she said, 
laying her embroidery hoop 
aside. 

Then, feeling that maybe this 
wasn’t enough : “And I should do 
my homework.” 

Instead of snapping at her, 
Old Sally laid down her own 



74 



GALAXY 



hoop and came over to sit down 
by her granddaughter on the 
tuckawny. “I know how you’re 
feeling, my dear. Even when I 
was a little girl and there were 
so many more things that had 
to be done, Sunday afternoons 
could be damn boring.” 

She laid her dry old hand on 
Tlisiveta’s, and the little girt, 
though she loved her grandmoth- 
er dearly, could not help but 
feel a little shiver — of what? 
of revulsion? dread? — at the 
long blue vein that snaked 
across the woman’s rough skin. 

“It wouldn’t be boring if we 
could see a movie,” Ilisiveta sug- 
gested, with, it seemed to her, 
Machiavellian slyness. 

“What movie would you like 
to see, darling?” 

“Oh, you know . .” 

The old woman’s face clouded 
over. “Oh, Ilisiveta, you’ve seen 
that one a hundred times. You 
don’t want to see it again.” 

“I do! Oh, Grandma, please ?” 
“Very well then, but you’ll 
have to set up the projector and 
run it yourself.” 

“I don’t know how!” 

“Then it’s time you learned.” 
Sally spent ten minutes super- 
vising the operation that would 
have taken herself two to per- 
form. A large plastic tile was 
removed from the floor, and the 
storage file (which the Ivanovs 
shared with the family on the 



level below) rose to the full 
height of the ceiling — some five 
and a half feet — with a pretty 
mechanical purr. Ilisiveta took 
out the movie projector from 
the bottom of the file and car- 
ried it to the utility table. She 
rummaged through the box of 
microfilm for the cylinder coded 
H-1998 (the number stood for 
the year it had been printed) 
and stuck this into the appro- 
priate slot in the machine. It 
threaded itself. A light indi- 
cated that it was ready to pro- 
ject. 

Only then did Ilisiveta recall 
that the screen had gone down 
the chute last week to Repairs 
and hadn’t yet returned, but she 
solved this problem without 
even a word to her grandmother. 
Taken out of its hoop and af- 
fixed to the wall with magnetic 
clasps, Sally’s sampler-to-be 
made a perfectly satisfactory 
screen. She adjusted the Night- 
light to Dimmest, Gray. There 
only remained for her or press 
the green button on the pro- 
jector. 

Ilisiveta wasn’t really interest- 
ed in the first three minutes of 
the movie. There was only the 
ship, looking like any other 
ship (if anything it was 
rather old fashioned), and the 
approach to the planet, which, 
though inherently dramatic, 
could be seen in more spectacu- 



THE ECHO OF WRATH

lar versions at school or even at 
home on the teevee. 

Then, suddenly, he was there 
— Ilisiveta’s grandfather, Dmitri 
Alexeyitch Ivanov, dead these 
many years but here now, smil- 
ing, young, and tanned. In a 
close-up shot, Dmitri Alexeyitch 
Ivanov waved his hand at the 
camera, and in the background 
a palm tree rustled its peculiar 
leaves in the wind. 

A palm tree! What a beauti- 
ful strange thing that was. There 
were, of course, no palm trees 
on Mars, and the sight of it here 
had all the mythic fascination 
for Ilisiveta that a tapestry of 
unicorns would have had for a 
girl of antiquity. 

For a precious moment the 
camera in the hands of the ama- 
teur cameraman (Sally, most 
likely) slipped and one could 
catch a glimpse of the sea (and 
of Dmitri’s chest, peeling from 
sunburn). The sea was blue. 

I lisiveta pressed the red but- 
ton, and the image froze on 
the cloth. In the brightest patch- 
es of the picture, where the sun- 
light glinted off the water, the 
incomplete arabesque on the 
backside of the nylon became 
visible, like a watermark or a 
message written in milk and 
onion juice. 

“How big was the sea?” Ilisi- 
veta asked. 

76 



“Well, my dear, you’ve seen 
the maps.” 

“Yes, but . But they’re just 
maps.” 

“The sea was very big. How 
can I say how big? There in 
the Phillipines you could see as 
much sea as you can see of the 
moss-fields from Mount Amer- 
ica.” Mount America, despite its 
grandiloquent title, was hardly 
more than a hill, though by 
Martian standards it was a very 
high hill — eight hundred feet 
at its crest — and considered 
something of a scenic wonder. 

“That big!” 

“Bigger,” Old Sally said grave- 
ly, caught up now herself in the 
spirit of reminisce. But her eyes 
were fixed not so much on the 
sea as on the frozen image of 
her husband, his stocky chest 
and broad chin, the one red 
with the sunburn he had got 
after only two days on Earth, 
the other tan with the charac- 
teristic tan of Mars. He had been 
only twenty-four then and but 
two years out of Mars med- 
school. He was, for both Sally 
and Ilisiveta, though in a differ- 
ent way for each, the very image 
of masculine perfection. 

“Let’s go on,” Sally said. She 
had learned that memories are 
savored best when they are not 
lingered upon. 

Ilisiveta pushed the green but- 
ton, and the camera had no

sooner righted itself than Dmitri 
and the palm tree vanished, and 
the honeymooners (for one 
could see at a glance that that’s 
what they were) appeared arm- 
in-arm on the observation deck 
of the Empire State Building. 
Sally Ivanov’s hair was fiery red 
instead of yellowish-gray, and a 
stiff wind kept whipping it into 
her face. Beyond them, a great 
dome covered the city, through 
which a sky of perfect blue 
(laced rather queerly with the 
traceries of an arabesque) glow- 
ed jewel-like. Mars had never 
witnessed a blue like the blue 
of that sky, and Ilisiveta, caught 
up in that simpler spectacle, 
hardly afforded a glance for the 
panorama of the great, jumbled 
city. 

“You’d never believe,” Sally 
was saying, with a touch of bit- 
terness, “how much trouble it 
was getting our visas for the 
States. If it hadn’t been for all 
the publicity we got in the Phil- 
lipines and the other neutral 
countries, I’m sure they’d have 
never let us in. It took an act of 
.Congress, would you believe it? 
And I was born in Oregon! But 
it wasn’t on my account we got 
in, it was because of Mitya. He 
was the hero of the moment, you 
know. For discovering the ser- 
um. The newspapers and maga- 
zines had a big appetite for 
heroes and not too much regard 



for truth, so it was Mitya got 
all the credit. I suppose, after 
all, it was good that he did — 
otherwise, we could hardly have 
afforded a honeymoon there. 
The round-trip fare was some 
impossible amount — about a 
hundred thousand freemars each 
— more than any of us colonists 
could have earned in a lifetime. 
It was the magazine that paid 
it for us. We weren’t supposed 
to smile or wave at any photog- 
raphers except the three that 
were always with us from the 
magazine. But Mitya was always 
cheating. He’d wave at anyone.” 
Sally laughed quietly. 

/^vn the screen, Dmitri was 
laughing too, even more 
quietly. Then he bent down to 
kiss his newlywed bride. No 
sooner had their lips parted 
than he swung around to face 
the camera, no longer smiling. 
Even without sound, you could 
tell by the parting of his lips 
what word he had said. If you 
knew such words in Russian. 

“That’s when they called him 
a name, isn’t it?” 

“Yes. It was a very bad name; 

I don’t think they meant for 
him to hear it.” 

“It was because he was Rus- 
sian?” 

“Oh, in Russia they called us 
just as bad names. It wasn’t be- 
cause he was Russian or I was 



THE ECHO OF WRATH 



77 



American — it was because we 
were Martians. Our revolution 
had only been two years before, 
and neither Russia or the States 
had recognized us officially. We 
were the first Free Martian citi- 
zens ever to come back to Earth. 
I never knew which they re- 
sented more — our being free 
and not caring about the Cold 
War — or our being a Russian 
and an American married to 
each other.” 

The next few scenes passed 
without commentary from Sally: 
the Statue of Liberty, decrepit, 
its torch-bearing arm fallen 
away; the storefronts of Fifth 
Avenue as the Ivanovs whizzed 
along on the central 5 mph 
pedestrian ramp; the antique, 
antiseptic beauty of Kennedy 
Airport. 

Then came the brief sequence 
along the Pennsylvania turn- 
pike: the jeering, gesticulating 
crowds, the posters of COMMY 
GO HOME. In Moscow there 
had been almost identical 
crowds and almost identical pos- 
ters (with YANK instead of 
COMMY), but by then the Ivan- 
ovs were hoarding their film for 
the nicer things. There, now, was 
the close-up of the woman who 
had tried to hit Sally with the 
WHY - DON’T - YOU - BACK 
WHERE- YOU-CAME - FROM 
poster. Ordinarily that woman 
would have been thought rather 



pretty, but as the camera had 
immortalized her she was mon- 
strous. Ilisiveta knew this wom- 
an very well, for she had return- 
ed to her often in nightmares, 
and she closed her eyes until 
she was sure that the monster 
would be gone. 

When she opened them, the 
room had become absolutely 
dark. The projector was dead, 
and the Dimmest, Gray light in 
the ceiling was extinguished as 
well. The air was tense with a 
terrible sound, the sound of si- 
lence. 

“The Converters,” Ilisiveta 
whispered, and in the same in- 
stant the emergency units came 
on. The air circulators circu- 
lated air again, and a dim light 
began flashing the emergency 
signal overhead. The doors 
whooshed open so that nobody 
might be trapped inside in the 
event (and this was quite un- 
thinkable) the emergency units 
should also go out. 

“It’s the tempest,” Sally said. 
“It’s put a big drain on the 
power.” 

Ilisiveta was very excited 
(there had been only one failure 
before in her whole life) and 
she wanted to rush out into the 
corridors of Level H ( the Ivan- 
ovs, being a prominent family, 
lived near the surface and en- 
joyed an authentic, not a tele- 
vised, view of the dome) where 



78 



GALAXY 



she might relish the disaster 
more fully. But she knew it 
would not do to leave her grand- 
mother alone at such a time, and 
then, before she could invent 
any sort of excuse, the main 
Converters turned on again, and 
the crisis was over. 

On the nylon screen the night- 
marish face of the woman from 
Pennsylvania vanished behind 
the blue uniform of a policeman. 

f >,ld Sally ordered the pro- 
^ jector to be turned off. 
Like most of the colonists over 
fifty (and Sally was thirty years 
past fifty), she had a bad heart. 
Though having lasted this long, 
it couldn’t be thought as bad as 
all that. Nevertheless she needed 
a moment of calm after such a 
fright as this. 

The Converters were the very 
lifeblood, the heartbeat, as it 
were, of the Nevsky Colony and 
all the other colonies of Mars 
or anywhere — Titan. Ganymede, 
Venus, Eros. It was the conver- 
ters that had made the establish- 
ment of the colonies, and later 
their independence, possible, for 
it gave them an almost inex- 
haustible source of power. With 
98 per cent efficiency, a con- 
verter could transform matter, 
any scrap of waste, into electri- 
cal energy. Here they provided 
power enough to grow vast hy- 
droponic cultures, mine the mea- 



ger deposits from the Martian 
hills, and to manufacture what- 
ever was absolutely necessary 
and a few things that were only 
nice. 

They were wonderful ma- 
chines, and Sally, like every 
colonist, was grateful to them; 
but it was galling to think that 
your life was so entirely depend- 
ent on their smooth operation 
and that without them there 
would not even be air to breathe, 
or heat, or life. 

After her two tranquilizers 
had taken hold, however, Sally 
seemed agreeable to let the mov- 
ie show go on. It would indeed 
have been a great cruelty to have 
brought it to a halt just then, 
for the next sequence, photo- 
graphed at the Bolshoi, was the 
chief reason Ilisiveta had want- 
ed to watch the old movie still 
once more. It was a dream as 
sweet as the preceding night- 
mare had been bitter. 

From out a glade of unreal 
trees three women advanced in 
dresses. They drifted like the 
mist, touching only the tips of 
their toes to the floor, lifting 
now those slim legs as easily as 
one would draw a breath of air. 
They drifted so in a wide circle 
and then they disappeared. A 
single woman stepped from be- 
hind the largest of the unreal 
trees. Her arms floated languid- 
ly, like the arms of a person

(though Ilisiveta had never seen 
such a thing) a person totally 
enveloped in water. But what 
her movements most suggested 
(and Ilisiveta could not have 
been expected to know this) was 
a swan. 

The little girl sighed. “It looks 
so easy. I wish . .” 

“Don’t be deceived by looks, 
Ilisa. The man who took us 
there, Ambassador Barnum I 
think his name was, he ex- 
plained that those girls start 
learning to dance like that when 
they’re no older than you, and 
they study every day for ten 
years before they can do some 
of those things right. Even then 
it’s only a few who are good 
enough to go on stage. He said 
their feet would be bloody from 
walking on their toes that way, 
and they could never eat the 
things they liked. It was harder 
than being in the Army. Harder 
than being on Mars almost.” 

“But, still I wish — ” 

“There’s no use making wishes 
like that, Ilisa,” Sally said in 
her sternest tone. And yet, she 
thought to herself, why, if not 
for the very same reason, the 
quest of this illusive Terran 
beauty, did she herself continue 
her copying, her embroideries, 
her castings? She so seldom met 
with a success, and yet these 
vanities had robbed the utili- 
tarian side of things (to which 



side she had devoted the best 
and major part of her life and 
strength) of all its attractiveness 
for her. She lusted for the in- 
eluctable. 

A nd now it seemed that she 
— or the film, which Ilisi- 
veta must have seen on the 
average of once a month — had 
communicated that same insati- 
able appetite to her granddaugh- 
ter — and that simply would 
not do. If an old woman chose 
to waste the rest of a useless life 
on nostalgic trifles, that was one 
thing; it was quite another when 
eight-year-old Ilisiveta spent 
hours alone in the bathroom 
trying to stand on her toes like 
the ballerinas of the Bolshoi 
Ballet. Someday, perhaps, there 
would be room on Mars for the- 
aters and artists and room in 
the colonists’ lives for the more 
arduous forms of leisure. But it 
wouldn’t be in Ilisiveta’s day, 
and the sooner she learned that 
lesson the better. 

They saw the rest of the film 
through in silence: the storm 
over the Caspian; Bernini’s col- 
onnade in front of St. Peter’s 
(they hadn’t been allowed to 
take a movie of their audience 
with John XXVII); the Heli- 
copter ride above the Alhambra. 

There were a dozen more 
glimpses of Dmitri and Sally 
Ivanov, a waving hand, a smile. 



80

a dress whipping about in the 
wind. Ilisiveta had seen these 
scenes innumerable times, and 
yet now they occasioned a 
strange new thought, a question 
that was really beyond her years 
to ask or answer: was the beau- 
tiful woman in that movie, radi- 
ant with health and happiness, 
the same person as eighty-year- 
old Sally Ivanov? Was that 
Ilisiveta’s grandmother? There 
was nothing in the body or the 
face of that decrepit woman 
that indicated a kinship. 

And yet, later that night, after 
her parents had come home from 
their jobs and she was lying in 
her bed in the hallway, listening 
(as usual, after a bad dust storm) 
to her grandmother coughing in 
the bathroom, it seemed to Ilisi- 
veta that perhaps they were one 
and the same person, continuous 
from then to now, and that 
she had only been able to see 
the transitional Sally Ivanovs, 
the mother, the widow, the hos- 
pital matron, the grande dame, 
instead of only the extreme ends 
the red and violet, of the spec- 
trum of her womanhood, then 
she would have been able to 
recognize the bride that still 
lived on beyond the body’s and 
time’s betrayal. This effort of 
empathy was for Ilisiveta a tri- 
umphant achievement of imagi- 
nation, but like most triumphs 
it was quickly dissipated. No 



sooner had the old woman her- 
self emerged from the tiny 
watercloset into the hallway 
than the whole structure came 
tumbling down under the sheer 
weight of the actual aged flesh. 
Ilisiveta’s grandmother could be 
nobody else but Ilisiveta’s grand- 
mother. 

“Have I been keeping you 
awake with my coughing?” 

“Oh no. I’ve been keeping my- 
self awake.” 

“With thoughts of what, my 
dear?” Smiling, for she sup- 
posed the girl was recalling that 
glimpse of Tatianova, and now 
it did not seem so terrible a 
thing for her to have daydreams 
of being a ballerina. 

“ . Nothing. Of nothing.” 

The old woman rested a hand 
on the Wall-South switch. “Do 
you mind — just for a minute?" 
Ilisiveta said nothing, and Sally 
turned the switch to Off. Im- 
mediately the living-room wall 
became transparent. 

“Thank heaven,” the old worn - 
an whispered. 

The dust storm was over. Both 
of them were quiet in view of 
the spectacle of the Martian 
night-sky, intense with stars, per- 
haps the most awesome sight on 
that planet. 

“There’s Cancer,” Ilisiveta 
said, pointing, “and there’s Leo 
the Lion, and there’s — ” 

“Earth,” said the old woman.

THE ECHO OF WRATH 




A new book packed with current 
Information on the moon-and-space 
program and its scientific byproducts 
—and an adventure into speculation... 



This book is a "must” for anyone associated with, 
or interested in, the space program. Written by 
Neil P. Ruzlc, editor and publisher of Industrial Research 
magazine, the book presents a lucid case for the 
exploration and exploitation of our natural satellite. 

It considers such areas as: research In the 
lunar vacuum; manufacturing operations on the moon; 
mining the surface of the moon; observing and 
probing the universe from the moon; using the moon 
as a base In the search for life beyond earth; and 
stimulating the economy through technological transfer.

“Earth? Where?” Ilisiveta 
wondered if maybe this were a 
joke. It didn’t sound like a joke, 
and her grandmother wasn’t 
smiling. 

She was, in fact, crying. 

Earth was, at the very best, 
a swirl of dust in the emptiness 
of space, invisible from Mars 
even to astronomers. The very 
Converters that had made life 
possible here and on the other 
planets had made it impossible 
on Earth. Indeed, they bad made 
Earth impossible. In a war that 
had lasted some few seconds, the 
Converters had simply converted 
Earth into pure energy — with a 
2 per cent residue of dust. 

Old Sally Ivanov made no 
reply to her granddaughter’s 
question. It became rather . 
well, uncomfortable being there 
in the room with her — the old- 
est woman on Mars and the last 
person anywhere who had ever 
seen and touched and smelt and 
actually walked on the planet 
on which the human race had 
originated and on which, so 
nearly, it had perished. 

In her own inept and eight- 
vear-old way, Ilisiveta did the 
best she could to comfort the 
old woman. 

“But, Grandmother,” she said, 
“there is no Earth.”

Where the 
Changed Ones Go

The Planet Vena s hated human 
beings. To survive, a human 
had to become something eisei 



I 

T he Venusian boy danced 
nimbly around the patch 
of Trouble Fungus behind the 
chapel, avoiding the gray -green 
killer with practice ease. He 
hop-skipped past the rubbery 
bole of the Limblime Tree and 



approached the serried row of 
jagged nameless stalks that lined 
the back garden. The boy 
grinned at them, and they parted 
for him as obligingly as the 
Red Sea had yielded to Moses 
some time earlier. 

“Here I am,” he said to Nich- 
olas Martell. 



83 



“I didn’t think you’d be back,” 
the Vorster missionary said. 

The boy — Elwhit — looked 
mischievous. “Brother Christo- 
pher said I couldn’t come back. 
That’s why I’m here. Tell me 
about the Blue Fire. Can you 
really make atoms give light?” 

“Come inside,” Martell said. 

The boy represented his first 
triumph since coming to Venus, 
and a small triumph it was, so 
far. But Martell did not object 
to that. A step was a step. There 
was a planet to win, here. 

Inside the chapel the boy 
hung back, suddenly shy. He was 
no more than ten, Martell 
guessed. Was it just wickedness 
that had made him come here? 
Or was he a spy from the chapel 
of heretics down the road? No 
matter. Martell would treat him 
as a potential convert. 

He activated the altar and the 
Blue Fire welled into the small 
room, colors dancing against the 
boards of the groined wooden 
ceiling. Power surged from the 
cobalt cube, and the harmless, 
dramatic radiations wrung a 
gasp of awe from Elwhit. 

“The fire is symbolic,” Mar- 
tell murmured. “There’s an un- 
derlying oneness in the universe 
— the common building-blocks, 
do you see? Do you know what 
atomic particles are? Protons, 
electrons, neutrons? The things 
everything’s made up of?” 

84 



“I can touch them,” Elwhit 
said. “I can push them around.” 

“Will you show me how?” 
Martell was remembering the 
way the boy had parted those 
knifeblade-sharp plants in back. 
A glance, a mental shove, and 
they had yielded. These Venu- 
sians could teleport, he was sure 
of it. “How do you push things?” 
Martell asked. But the boy 
shrugged the question aside. 

“Tell me more about the Blue 
Fire,” he said. 

“Have you read the book I 
gave you? The one by Vorst? 
That tells you all you need to 
know.” 

“Brother Christopher took it 
away from me.” 

“You showed it to him?” Mar- 
tell said, startled. 

“He wanted to know why I 
came to you. I said you talked 
to me and gave me a book. He 
took the book. I came back. Tell 
me why you’re here. Tell me 
what you teach.” 

A If artell hadn’t imagined that 
his first convert would be 
a child. He said carefully, “The 
religion we have here is very 
much like the one that Brother 
Christopher teaches. But there 
are some differences. His people 
make up a lot of stories. They’re 
good stories, but they’re only 
stories.” 

“About Lazarus, you mean?” 
GALAXY 



“That’s right. Myths, nothing 
more. We try not to need such 
things. We’re trying to get right 
in touch with the basics of the 
universe. We — ” 

The boy lost interest. He 
tugged at his tunic and nudged 
at a chair. The altar was what 
fascinated him, nothing else. 
The glistening eyes roved toward 
it. 

Martell said, “The cobalt is 
radioactive. It’s a source of 
betas — electrons. They’re going 
through the tank and knocking 
photons loose. That’s where the 
light comes from.” 

“I can stop the light,” the boy 
said. “Will you be angry if I 
stop it?” 

It was a kind of sacrilege. Mar- 
tell knew. But he suspected that 
he would be forgiven. Any evi- 
dence of teleporting activity that 
he could gather was useful. 

“Go ahead,” he said. 

The boy remained motionless. 
But the radiance dimmed. It was 
as if an invisible hand reached 
into the reactor, intercepting the 
darting particles. Telekinesis on 
the subatomic level! Martell was 
elated and chilled all at once 
watching the light fade. Sudden- 
ly it flared more brightly again. 
Beads of sweat glistened on the 
boy’s bluish-purple forehead. 

“That is all,” Elwhit an- 
nounced. 

“How do you do it?” 

WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



“I reach.” He laughed. “You 
can’t?” 

“Afraid not,” Martell said. 
“Listen, if I give you another 
book to read, will you promise 
not to show it to Brother Chris- 
topher? I don’t have many. I 
can’t afford to have the Harmo- 
nists confiscate them all.” 

“Next time,” the boy said. “I 
don’t feel like reading things 
now. I’ll come again. You tell 
me all about it some other time.” 
He danced away, out of 
the chapel, and went skipping 
through the underbrush, heed- 
less of the perils that lurked in 
the deep -shadowed forest be- 
yond. Martell watched him go, 
not knowing whether he was 
actually making his first convert 
or whether he was being mocked. 

Perhaps both, the missionary 
thought. 

X Jicholas Martell had come to 
^ Venus ten days before, 
aboard a passenger ship from 
Mars. He had been one of thirty 
passengers aboard the ship, but 
none of the others had cared 
for Nicholas Martell’s company. 
Ten of them were Martians, who 
did not care to share the atmos- 
phere Martell breathed. Mar- 
tians, now that their planet had 
been cozily terraformed, prefer- 
red to fill their lungs with an 
Earthside mix of gases. So had 
Martell, once, for he was a na- 

85 




tive Earthman himself. But now 
he was one of the changed ones, 
equipped with gills in good Ven- 
usian fashion. 

i lot gills, truly: they would 
serve no function under water. 
They were high-density filters, 
to strain the molecules of decent 
oxygen from the Venusian air. 
Martell was well adapted. His 
metabolism had no use for heli- 
um or the other inerts, but it 
could draw sustenance from ni- 
trogen, and had no real objec- 
tions to fueling on CO2 for short 
spells. The surgeons at Santa Fe 
had worked on him for six 
months. 

It was forty years too late to 
make adjustments on Martell- 



ovum or Martell-fetus, as was the 
normal practice in fitting a man 
for life on Venus, so they had 
done their work on Martell the 
man. The blood that flowed in 
his veins was no longer red. His 
skin had a fine cyanotic flush. 
He was as a Venusian born. 

There had been nineteen 
Venusians of the true blood 
aboard the ship, too. But they 
felt no kinship for Martell, and 
had forced him to withdraw 
from their presence. The crew- 
men had set up Martell’s cradle 
in a storage chamber, with gen- 
tle apologies: “You know those 
Venusians, Brother. Give them 
the wrong kind of look and 
they’re at you with their daggers. 



86

WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



You’ll stay here. You'll be safer 
hare.” A thin laugh. “You’ll be 
even safer, Brother, if you head 
for home without ever setting 
foot on Venus.” 

Martell had smiled. He was 
prepared to let Venus do its 
worst 

~f J enus had martyred several 

’ dozen members of Mar- 
t ell’s religious order in the past 
forty years. He was a Vorster, 
or, more formally a member 
erf the Brotherhood of the Im- 
manent Radiance, and he had 
attached himself to the mission- 
ary wing. 

Unlike his martyred predeces- 
sors, Martell was surgically 
adapted to live on Venus. The 
others had had to muffle them- 
selves in breathing-suits, and 
perhaps that had limited their 
effectiveness. The Vorsters had 
made no headway on Venus at 
ah, though they were the domi- 
nant religious group on Earth, 
and had been for more than a 
generation. Martell, alone and 
adapted, had taken upon himself 
the long-delayed task of found- 
ing a Venusian order of the 
Brotherhood. 

Venus had given Martell a 
chilly welcome. He had blanked 
out in the turbulence of the 
landing, as the ship plunged 
through the cloud layer. Then 
he had recovered and sat up. a 

87 



thin man with a wedge-shaped 
face and pale, hooded eyes. 
Through the port he had his 
first glimpse of Venus: a flat, 
muddy-looking field, stretching 
perhaps half a mile, with 
trunked ugly trees whose massed 
bluish leaves had a sinister glint. 
The sky was gray, and swirling 
clumps of low - lying clouds 
formed whorling patterns 
against the deeper background. 
Robot technicians were bustling 
from a squat, alien-looking 
buildng to service the ship. 

In the landing station, a low- 
caste Venusian stared at the 
Vorster with blank indifference, 
taking his passport and saying 
coolly “Religious?” 

“That’s right.” 

“How’d you get in?” 

“Treaty of 2128,” Martell said. 
“A limited quota of Earthside 
observers for scientific, ethical 
or — ” 

“Spare me.” The Venusian 
pressed his fingertip to a page 
of the passport and a visa stamp 
appeared, glowing brilliantly. 
“Nicholas Martell. You’ll die 
here, Martell. Why don’t you go 
back where you came from? 
Men live forever there, don’t 
they?” 

“They live a long time. But 
I have work here.” 

“Fool!” 

“Perhaps,” Martell agreed 
calmly. “May I go?” 

88 



“Where are you staying? We 
have no hotels here.” 

“The Martian Embassy will 
look after me until I’m estab- 
lished.” 

“You’ll never be established,” 
the Venusian said. 

Martell did not contradict 
him. He knew that even a low- 
caste Venusian regarded himself 
as superior to an Earthman, and 
that a contradiction might seem 
a mortal insult. Martell was not 
equipped for dagger-dueling. 
And, since he was not a proud 
man by nature, he was willing 
to swallow any manner of abuse 
for the sake of his mission. 

The passport man waved him 
on. Martell gathered up his 
single suit case and passed out 
of the building. 

A taxi, now, he thought. It 
was many miles to town. He 
needed to rest, and to confer 
with the Martian Ambassador, 
Weiner. The Martians were not 
particularly sympathetic to his 
aims, but at least they were will- 
ing to countenance Martell’s 
presence here. There was no 
Earth Embassy, not even a con- 
sulate. The links between the 
mother planet and her proud 
colony had been broken long 
ago. 

npaxis waited at the far side 
of the field. Martell started 
across. The ground crunched be- 



GALAXY 



neath his feet, as though it were 
only a brittle crust. The planet 
looked gloomy. Not a hint of 
sun came through those clouds. 
His adapted body was function- 
ing well, though. 

Hardly anyone but robots 
seemed to be about at the space- 
port. Venus was a sparsely pop- 
ulated planet, with hardly more 
than three million people in its 
seven widely spaced towns. The 
Venusians were frontiersmen, 
legendary for their haughtiness. 
They had room to be haughty, 
Martell thought. Let them spend 
a week on teeming Earth and 
they might change their ways. 

“Taxi!” Martell called. 

None of the robocars budged 
from their line. Were even the 
robots haughty here, he won- 
dered? Or was there something 
wrong with his accent? He 
called again, getting no response. 

Then he understood. The Ve- 
nusian passengers were emerging 
and crossing to the taxi zone. 
And, naturally, they had prece- 
dence. 

Martell watched them. They 
were high-caste men, unlike the 
passport man. They walked with 
an arrogant swaggering gait, 
and Martell knew they would 
slash him to his knees if he 
crossed their path. 

He felt a bit of contempt for 
them. What were they, anyway, 
but blue-skinned samurai, bor- 



der lairds after their proper time, 
childlike self-appointed prince- 
lings living a medieval fantasy? 
Men who were sure of them- 
selves did not need to swag- 
ger, nor to surround themselves 
with elaborate codes of chivalry. 

But yet they were impressive 
as they paraded across the field. 
More than custom separated the 
high-caste and the low-caste Ve- 
nusians. They were biologically 
different. 

The high-caste ones were the 
first comers, die founding fami- 
lies of the Venus colony, and 
they were far more alien in 
body and mind than Venusians 
of more recent vintage. The early 
genetic processes had been un- 
subtle. The first colonists had 
been transformed virtually into 
monsters. Close to eight feet tall, 
with giant pores, and pendulous 
red gill-bunches at their throats, 
they were alien beings who gave 
little sign that they were the 
great - great - grandchildren of 
Earthmen. 

Later in the process of colon- 
izing Venus, it had become pos- 
sible to adapt men for the second 
planet without varying nearly so 
much from the basic human 
model. Both strains of Ve- 
nusians, since they arose from 
manipulation of the germ plasm, 
bred true; both shared the same 
exaggerated sense of honor and 
both were now alien strains, in-

wardly and outwardly, in mind 
and in body. But those whose 
ancestry went back to the most 
changed of the changed ones 
were in charge, making a virtue 
of their strangeness and the 
planet was their private play- 
ground. 

Martell watched as the high 
caste ones drove off. No taxis 
remained. The ten Martian pas- 
sengers of the ship were getting 
into a cab on the other side of 
the depot. Martell returned to 
the building. The lowcaste Ve- 
nusian glowered at him. 

Martell said, “When will I 
be able to get a taxi to take me 
to town?” 

“You won’t. They aren’t com- 
ing back today.” 

“I want to call the Martian 
Embassy, then. They’ll send a 
car for me.” 

“Are you sure they will? Why 
should they bother?” 

“Perhaps so!” Martell said 
evenly. “I’d better walk.” 

The look he got from the Ve- 
nusian was worth the gesture. 
The man stared in surprise and 
Shock. And possibly, admiration, 
mingled somewhat with patron- 
izing confidence that Mar- 
tell must be a madman. Martell 
left the station. He began to 
walk, following the narrow rib- 
bon of a road, letting the un- 
earthly atmosphere soak deep in- 
to his altered body. 



I t was a lonely walk. Not a 
sign of habitation broke 
the belt of vegetation on either 
side of the highway, nor did any 
vehicles pass him. The trees, 
somber and eerie with their blu- 
ish cast, towered over the road. 
Their knifeblade-Iike leaves 
glimmered in the faint diffused 
light. There was an occasional 
rustling sound in the woods, as 
of beasts crashing through the 
thickets. 

Martell’s mind hummed with 
plans. 

He would establish a small 
chapel and let it be known what 
the Brotherhood had to offer: 
life eternal and the key to the 
stars. The Venusians might 
threaten to kill him, as they had 
killed previous missionaries of 
the Brotherhood, but Martell 
was prepared to die, if necessary, 
that others might have the stars. 
His faith was strong. 

Before his departure, the high 
ones of the Brotherhood had 
personally wished him well : 
grizzled Reynolds Kirby, the 
Hemispheric Coordinator, had 
grasped his hand, and then had 
come an even greater surprise 
as Noel Vorst himself, the 
Founder, a legendary figure 
more than a century old, had 
come forth to tell him in a soft, 
feathery voice, “I know that 



90 



GALAXY 



your mission will bear fruit, 
Brother Martell.” 

Martell still tingled with the 
memory of that glorious mo- 

ment. 

Now he strode forward, buoy- 
ed by the sight of a few habi- 
tations set back from the road. 
He was at the outskirts, then. 

On this pioneer world, pioneer 

habits held true, and the colon- 
ists did not build their homes 
close together. They spread 
sparsely over a radiating area 
surrounding the main adminis- 
trative centers. The man-high 
walls enclosing the first houses 
he saw did not surprise him; 

these Venusians were a surly lot, 
who would build a wall around 
their entire planet, if they could. 
But soon he would be in town, 
and then — 

Martell came to a halt as he 
saw the Wheel hurtling toward 
him. 

| Tis first thought was that it 

^ had broken free from some 
vehicle. Then he realized what 
it was: no fragment of machin- 
ery, but Venusian wildlife. 

It surged over a crest in the 
road, a hundred yards in front 
of him, and came plunging 
wildly toward him at about 
ninety miles an hour. Martell 
had a clear though momentary 
glimpse: two wheels of some 
horny substance, mottled orange 

WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



and yellow, linked by a box-like 
inner structure. The wheels were 
nine feet across, at least; the 
connecting structure was small- 
er, so that wheel-rims projected 
around it. Those rims - were 
razor-sharp. The creature moved 
by ceaselessly transferring its 
weight within that central hous- 
ing, developing terrific momen- 
tum. 

Martell leaped back. The 
Wheel hurtled past him, missing 
his toes by inches. Martell saw 
the sharpness of the rim and 
felt an acrid odor sting his nos- 
trils. If he had been a bit slower, 
the Wheel would have sliced 
him in two. 

It traveled a hundred yards 
beyond him. Then, like a gyro- 
scope running amok, it executed 
a turn in an astonishingly nar- 
row radius and came shooting 
back toward Martell. 

The thing’s hunting me, he 
thought! 

He knew many Vorster com- 
bat techniques, but none of them 
were designed to cope with a 
beast like this. All he could do 
was keep side stepping and hope 
that the Wheel could not make 
sudden compensations in its 
course. It drew near; Martell 
sucked in his breath and leaped 
back once again. 

This time the Wheel swerved 
ever so slightly. Its leading left- 
hand edge sliced through the 

91 



trailing end of Martell’s blue 
cloak, and a ribbon of cloth 
fluttered to the pavement. Pant- 
ing, Martell watched the thing 
swing round for another try, 
and knew that it could indeed 
correct its course. A few more 
passes and it would split him. 

The Wheel came a third time. 

Martell waited as long as he 
dared. With the outer blades 
only a few feet away, he broad- 
iumped — into the path of the 
creature. 

Earthbom muscles carried 
him twenty feet in the light 
gravity. He more than half ex- 
pected to be bisected in mid- 
jump, but when his feet touched 
ground he was still in one piece. 

Whirling, Martell saw that he 
had surprised the beast. It had 
turned inward, toward the place 
where it had expected him to 
be, and had passed through his 
suitcase. The suitcase had been 
sliced as though by a laser beam. 
His belongings were scattered on 
the road. The Wheel, halting 
once more, was coming back. 

What now? Climb a tree? The 
nearest one was void of limbs 
for the first twenty feet. Martell 
could not shinny to safety in 
time. All he could do was keep 
hopping from side to side in 
the road, trying to outguess the 
creature. He knew that he could 
not keep that up much longer. 
He would tire, and the Wheel 



would not, and the slashing 
rims would pass through him 
and spill his altered guts on the 
pavement. 

The Wheel came. Martell side- 
stepped it again and heard it 
whistle past. Was it getting an- 
gry? No, it was just an insensate 
brute looking for a meal, hunt- 
ing in the manner some perverse 
nature had designed for it. Mar- 
tell gasped for breath. On the 
next pass — 

Quddenly he was not alone. 
^ A boy appeared, running 
out from one of the stockaded 
buildings at the crest of the 
hill, and trotted alongside the 
Wheel for a few paces. 

Then — Martell did not see 
how it was done — the Wheel 
went awry and toppled, landing 
on one disk with the other in 
the air. It lay there like a huge 
cheese blocking the road. The 
boy, who could not have been 
much more than ten, stood by 
it, looking pleased with himself. 

He was low-caste, of course. 
A high- caste one would not have 
bothered to save him. Martell 
realized that probably the low- 
caste boy had had no interest 
in saving him either, but simply 
had knocked the Wheel over for 
the sport of it. 

Martell said, “I offer thanks, 
friend. Another moment and I’d 
have been cut to ribbons.” 



92 



GALAXY 



The boy made no reply. Mar- 
tell came closer to inspect the 
fallen Wheel. Its upper rim was 
straining to right itself, clearly 
an impossible task. Martell 
looked down, saw a dark violet 
cyst near the center of one wheel 
writhe and open. 

“Look out!” the boy cried, but 
it was much too late. 

Two whip-like threads burst 
from the cyst. One wrapped it- 
self around Martell’s left thigh, 
the other around the boy’s waist. 
Martell felt a blaze of pain, as 
though the threads were lined 
with acid - edged suckers. A 
mouth opened on the inner sur- 
face of the Wheel. Martell saw 
milling, grinding tooth-like pro- 
jections beginning to chum in 
anticipation. 

But this was a situation he 
could handle. He had no way 
of stopping the headlong plunge 
of the Wheel, for that was mere 
mechanical energy at work; but 
presumably the creature’s brain 
carried an electrical charge, and 
the Vorsters had ways of altering 
current flows in the brain. It 
' was a mild form of esping, with- 
in the threshold of nearly any- 
one who cared to master the 
disciplines involved. 

Ignoring the pain, Martell 
seized the tightening thread 
with his right hand and perform- 
ed the act of neutralization. A 
moment later the thread went 



slack and Martell was free. So 
was the boy. The threads did 
not return to the cyst, but re- 
mained lying limp in the road- 
way. The milling teeth became 
still; the rippling homy plate 
of the upper wheel subsided. The 
thing was dead. Martell glanced 
at the boy. 

“Fair enough,” he said. “I’ve 
saved you and you’ve saved me. 
So now we’re even.” 

“The debit is still yours,” re- 
plied the boy with strange solem- 
nity. “If I had not rescued you 
first, you never would have lived 
to rescue me. And it would not 
have been necessary to rescue 
me, anyway, since I would not 
have come out onto the road, 
and therefore — ” 

Martell’s eyes widened. “Who 
taught you to reason like that?” 
he asked in amusement. “You 
sound like a theology professor.” 
“I am Brother Christopher’s 
pupil.” 

“And he is — ?” 

“You’ll find out. He wants to 
see you. He sent me out here 
to fetch you.” 

“And where will I find him?” 
“Come with me.” 

/T artell followed the boy to- 
•*-*-*■ ward one of the buildings. 
They left the dead Wheel in the 
road. Martell wondered what 
would happen if a carload of 
high-caste came along and had 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO

to shove the carcass out of the 
way with their own aristocratic 
hands. 

They passed through a burn- 
ished coppery gate that slid 
open at the boy’s approach. Mar- 
tel! found himself approaching 
a simple wooden A-frame build- 
ing. When he saw the sign 
mounted above the door, he was 
so amazed that he release his 
grip on his sundered suitcase, 
and for the second time in ten 
minutes his belongings went 
spilling to the ground. 

The sign said : 

SHRINE OF THE 
TRANSCENDENT 
HARMONY 
ALL ARE WELCOME 

Martell’s knees felt watery. 
Harmonists? Here ? 

The green-robed Harmonists 
were heretics, offshoots of the 
original Vorster movement. 
They had made some progress 
on Earth for a while, and had 
even seemed to threaten the 
parent organization, but for 
more than twenty years now 
they had been nothing but an 
absurd little splinter group of no 
significance. It was inconceiv- 
able that these heretics, who had 
failed so utterly on Earth, could 
have established a church here 
on Venus, something that the 
Vorsters themselves had been 



unable to do. It was impossible. 

A figure appeared in the door- 
way — a stocky man in early 
middle age, about sixty or so, 
his hair beginning to gray, his 
features thickening. Like Mar- 
tell, he had been surgically 
adapted to Venusian conditions. 
He looked calm and self-assured. 
His hands rested lightly on a 
comfortable priestly paunch. 

He said, “I’m Christopher 
Mondschein. I heard of your 
arrival, Brother Martell. Won’t 
you come in?” 

Martell hesitated. 

Mondschein smiled. “Come, 
come. Brother. There’s no peril 
in breaking bread with a Har- 
monist, is there? You’d be 
mincemeat now but for the lad’s 
bravery. And I sent him to save 
you; you owe me the courtesy 
of a visit. Come in. Come in. 
I won’t meddle with your soul. 
Brother. That’s a promise.” 

Ill 

rr^he Harmonist place was un- 
assuming but obviously 
permanent. There was a shrine, 
festooned with the statuettes 
and claptrap of the heresy, and 
a library, and dwelling-quarters. 
Martell caught sight of sev 
eral Venusian-bodies at work in 
the rear of the building, digging 
what might be the foundations 
of an extension. 



94 



GALAXY 



Martell followed the older 
man into the library. A familiar 
row of books caught his eye: the 
works of Noel Vorst, handsome- 
ly bound, the expensive Found- 
er’s Edition. 

Mondschein said, “Are you 
surprised? Don’t forget that we 
accept the supremacy of Vorst 
too, even if he spurns us. Sit 
down. Wine? They make a fine 
dry white here.” 

"What are you doing here?” 
Martell asked. 

“Me? That’s a terribly long 
story, and not entirely creditable 
to me. The essence of it is that 
I was a young fool and let my- 
self get maneuvered into being 
sent here. That was forty years 
ago and I’ve stopped resenting 
what happened by now. It was 
the finest thing that could have 
happened to me in my life, I’ve 
come to realize, and I suppose 
it’s a mark of maturity that I 
was able to see — ” 

Mondschein’s garrulity irri- 
tated Martell. He cut in : “I don’t 
want your personal history, 
Brother Mondschein. I meant, 
how long has your order been 
here?” 

“Close to fifty years.” 
“Uninterruptedly?” 

“Yes. We have eight shrines 
here and about four thousand 
communicants, all of them low- 
caste. The high-casters don’t 
deign to notice us.” 



“They don’t deign to wipe 
you out, either,” Martell ob- 
served. 

“True,” said Mondschein. 
“Perhaps we’re beneath their 
contempt.” 

“But they’ve killed every Vor- 
ster missionary that’s ever come 
here,” Martell said. “Us they 
devour, you they tolerate. Why 
is that?” 

“Perhaps they see a strength 
in us that they don’t find in the 
parent organization,” suggested 
the heretic. “They admire 
strength, of course. You must 
know that, or you’d never have 
tried to walk from the landing 
station. You were demonstrating 
your strength under stress. But 
of course it would rather have 
spoiled your demonstration if 
that Wheel had slashed you to 
death.” 

“As it very nearly did.” 

“As it certainly would have 
done,” said Mondschein, “if I 
had not happened to notice your 
predicament. That would have 
terminated your mission here 
rather prematurely. Do you like 
the wine?” 

Martell had barely tasted it. 

“It’s not bad. Tell me, Mond- 
schein, have they really let them- 
selves be converted here?” 

“A few. A few.” 

“Hard to believe. What do you 
people know that we don’t?” 

“It isn’t what we know,” 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



95 



Mondschein said. “It’s what we 
have to offer. Come with me into 
the chapel.” 

“I’d rather not.” 

“Please. It won’t give you a 
disease.” 



O eluctantly Martell allowed 
himself to be led into the 
sanctum sanctorum. 

He looked around with dis- 
taste at the ikons, the images, 
and all the rest of the Harmon- 
ist rubbish. At the altar, where 
a Vorster chapel would have 
had the tiny reactor emitting 
blue Cerenkov radiation, there 
was mounted a gleaming atom- 
symbol model along which elec- 
tron-simulacra pulsed in blind- 
ing, ceaseless motion. Martell 
did not think of himself as a 
bigoted man, but he was loyal 
to his faith, and the sight of all 
this childish paraphernalia sick- 
ened him. 

Mondschein said, “Noel Vorst’s 
the most brilliant man of our 
times, and his accomplishments 
mustn’t be underrated. He saw 
the culture of Earth fragmented 
and decadent, saw people every- 
where escaping into drug addic- 
tions and Nothing Chambers 
and a hundred other deplorable 
things. And he saw that the old 
religions had lost their grip, that 
the time was ripe for an eclectic, 
synthetic new creed that dis- 
pensed with the mysticism of the 



former religions and replaced it 
with a new kind of mysticism. 
A scientific mysticism. That 
Blue Fire of his! A wonderful 
symbol, something to capture 
the imagination and dazzle the 
eye. As good as the Cross and 
the Crescent — even better be- 
cause it was modern, it was 
scientific, it could be compre- 
hended even while it bewildered. 
Vorst had the insight to estab- 
lish his cult and the administra- 
tive ability to put it across. But 
his thinking was incomplete.” 

“That’s a lofty dismissal, isn’t 
it? When you consider that we 
control Earth in a way that no 
single religious movement of the 
past has ever — ” 

Mondschein smiled. “The 
achievement on Earth is very 
imposing, I agree. Earth was 
ready for Vorst’s doctrines. But 
why did he fail on the other 
planets, though? Because his 
thinking was too advanced. He 
didn’t offer anything that colo- 
nists could surrender their 
hearts and souls to.” 

“He offers physical immortal- 
ity in the present body,” Mnr- 
tell said crisply. “Isn’t that 
enough?” 

“No. He doesn’t offer a myth- 
os. Just a cold quid-pro-quo, 
come to the chapel and pay your 
tithe and you can live forever, 
maybe. It’s a secular religion, 
despite all the litanies and rit- 



96 



GALAXY 



uals that have been creeping in. 
It lacks poetry. There’s no 
Christ-child in the manger, no 
Abraham sacrificing Isaac, no 
spark of humanity, no — ” 

“No simplistic fairy-tales,” 
said Martell in a brusque tone. 
“Agreed. That’s the whole point 
of our teaching. We came into 
a world no longer capable of 
believing the old stories, and in- 
stead of spinning new ones we 
offered simplicity, strength, the 
power of scientific achieve- 
ment — ” 

“And took political control of 
most of the planet, while also 
establishing magnificent labora- 
tories that carried or. advanced 
research in longevity and esping. 




WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



97 



Fine. Fine. Admirable. But you 
failed here. We are succeeding. 
We have a story to tell, the 
story of Noel Vorst, the First 
Immortal, his redemption in the 
atomic fire, his awakening from 
sin. We offer our people a 
chance to be redeemed in Vorst 
and in the later prophet of 
Transcendent Harmony, David 
Lazarus. What we have is' some- 
thing that captures the fancy of 
the low-casters, and in another 
generation we’ll have the high- 
casters too. These are pioneers, 
Brother Martell. They’ve cut all 
ties with Earth and they’re 
starting over on their own, in a 
society just a few generations 
old. They need myths. They’re 
shaping myths of their own here. 
Don’t you think that in another 
century the first colonists of 
Venus will be regarded as super- 
natural beings, Martell? Don't 
you think that they’ll he Har- 
monist saints by then?” 

T\ /jTartell was genuinely star- 
iVjL tied. “Is that your game?” 

“Part of it.” 

‘All you’re doing is returning 
to fifth-century Christianity.” 

“Not exactly. We’re continu- 
ing the scientific work, too.” 

“And you believe your own 
teachings?” Martell asked. 

Mondschein smiled strangely. 
“When I was young,” he said, 
“I was a Vorster acolyte, at the 



Nyack chapel. I went into the 
Brotherhood because it was a 
job. I needed a structure for my 
Hfe, and I had a wild hope of 
being sent out to Sante Fe to 
become a subject in the immor- 
tality experiments, and so I en- 
rolled. For the most unworthy 
of motives. Do you know, Mar- 
tell, that I didn’t feel a shred 
of a religious calling? Not even 
the Vorster stuff — stripped 
down, secular — could get to me. 
Through a series of confusions 
that I still don’t fully under- 
stand, and that I won’t even be- 
gin to explain to you, I left the 
Brotherhood and joined the 
Harmonist heresy and came here 
as a missionary. The most suc- 
cessful missionary ever sent to 
Venus, as it happens. Do you 
think the Harmonist mytholo- 
gies can move me if I was too 
rational to accept Vorster think- 
ing?” 

“So you’re completely cynical 
in handing out this nonsense 
about saints and images. You do 
it for the sake of preserving your 
power. A peddler of nostrums, 
a quack preacher in the back 
woods of Venus — ” 

“Easy,” Mondschein warned. 
“I’m getting results. And, as I 
think Noel Vorst himself might 
tell you, we deal in ends, not 
in means. Would you like to 
kneel here and pray a while?” 

“Of course not.” 



98 



GALAXY 



“May I pray for you, then?” 
“You just told me you don’t 
believe your own creed.” 

Smiling, Mondschein said, 

“Even the prayers of an unbe- 
liever may be heard. Who 

knows? Only one thing is cer- 
tain: you’ll die here, Martell. So 
111 pray for you, that you may 
pass through the purifying flame 
of the higher frequencies.” 
"Spare me. Why are you so 
sure I’ll die here? It’s a fallacy 
to assume that simply because 
all previous Vorster missionar- 
ies have been martyred here, 1’H 
be martyred too.” 

“Our own position is uneasy 
enough here. Yours will be im- 
possible. Venus doesn’t want 
you. Shall I tell you the only 
way you’ll possibly live more 
than a month here?” 

“Do.” 

“Join us.” 

“Don’t be absurd. Do you 
really think I’d do that.” 

“It isn’t beyond possibility. 
Many men have left your order 
for mine — myself included.” 

“I prefer martyrdom.” 

£ cTn what way will that bene- 
Afit anybody? Be reason- 
able, Brother. Venus is a fasci- 
nating place. Wouldn’t you like 
to live to see a little of it? Join 
us. You’ll learn the rituals soon 
enough. You’ll see that we aren’t 
such ogres.” 



“Thank you,” said Martell. 
“Will you excuse me now?” 

"I had hoped you would be 
our guest for dinner.” 

“That won’t be possible. I’m 
expected at the Martian Embas- 
sy, if I don’t meet any more 
local beasts in the road.” 
Mondschein looked unruffled 
by Martell’s rejection of his 
offer — an offer that could not 
have been made, Martell 
thought, with any great serious- 
ness. The older man said grave- 
ly, “Allow me at least to offer 
you transportation to town. 
Surely your pride in your own 
sanctity will permit you to ac- 
cept that.” 

Martell smiled. “Gladly. It’ll 
make a good story to tell Co- 
ordinator Kirby — how the here- 
tics saved my life and gave me 
a ride into town.” 

“After making an attempt to 
seduce you from your faith.” 
“Naturally. May I leave?” 
“It’ll be a few moments until 
I can arrange for the car. Would 
you like to wait outside?” 
Martell bowed and made a 
grateful escape from the hereti- 
cal chapel. Passing through the 
yard, a cleared space some fifty 
feet square bordered by scaly, 
grayish- green shrubbery whose 
thick-petalled black flowers had 
an oddly carnivorous look. 

Four Venusian boys, includ- 
ing Martell’s rescuer, were at 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



99 



work on an excavation. They 
were using manual tools, shov- 
els and picks, which gave Mar- 
tell the uncomfortable sensation 
of having slid back into the 
nineteenth century. Earth’s 
gaudy array of gadgetry, so con- 
spicuous and so familiar, could 
not be found here. 

The boys glared coldly at him 
and went on with their work. 
Martell watched. 

They were lean and supple, 
and he guessed that their ages 
ranged from about nine to four- 
teen, though it was hard to tell. 
They looked alike enough to be 
brothers. Their movements 
were graceful, almost elegant, 
and their bluish skins gleamed 
lightly with perspiration. It 
seemed to Martell that the bony 
structure of their bodies was 
even more alien than he had 
thought; they did improbable 
things with their joints as they 
worked. 

Abruptly, they tossed their 
picks and shovels aside and 
joined hands. The bright eyes 
closed a moment. Martell saw 
the loose dirt rise from the ex- 
cavation pit and collect itself in 
a neat mound some twenty feet 
behind it. 

They’re pushers, Martell 
thought in wonder. Look at 
them ! 

Brother Mondschein appeared 
at that precise moment. “The 



car is waiting, Brother,” he said 
smoothly. 

IV 

As he entered the Venusian 
-**■ city, Martell could not take 
his mind from the casual feat 
of the four boys. They had 
sqpoped a few hundred pounds 
of loose soil from a pit, using 
esp abilities, and had smugly 
deposited it just where they 
wanted it to go. 

Pushers! Martell trembled, 
with barely suppressed excite- 
ment. The espers of Earth were 
a numerous tribe, now, but 
their talents were mainly tele- 
pathic, not extending in the di- 
rection of telekinesis to any sig- 
nificant degree. Nor could the 
development of the powers be 
controlled. A program of 
scheduled breeding, now in its 
fourth or fifth generation, was 
intensifying the existing esp 
powers. A gifted esper could 
reach into a man’s mind and 
rearrange its contents, or probe 
for the deepest secrets. There 
were a few precogs, too, who 
ranged up and down the time 
sequence as though all points 
along it were one point. But they 
usually burned out in adoles- 
cence, and their genes were lost 
to the pool. Pushers — teleports 
— who could move physical ob- 
jects from place to place — were 



100 



GALAXY 



as rare as phoenixes on Earth. 

And here were four of them in 
a Harmonist chapel’s back yard 
on Venus. 

New tensions quivered in Mar- 
tell. He had made two unex- 
pected discoveries on his first 
day: the presence of Harmonists 
on Venus, and the presence of 
pushers among the Harmonists. 
His mission had suddenly taken 
on devastating new urgency. It 
was no longer merely a matter 
of gaining a foothold on an un- 
friendly world. It was a matter 
of being outstripped and sur- 
passed by a heresy thought to 
be in decline. 

The car Mondschein had pro- 
vided dropped Martell off at the 
Martian Embassy, a blocky little 
plaza that seemed to be the en- 
tire town. The Martians breathed 
Earth-type air, and they did not 
care to adapt themselves to Ve- 
nusian conditions. Once he en- 
tered the building, therefore, 
Martell had to accept a breath- 
ing-hood that would protect him 
against the atmosphere of the 
planet of his birth. 

ry^lie Ambassador was Free- 
man Nat Weiner. He was 
about twice Martell’s age, per- 
haps even older — close to nine- 
ty, even. His frame was power- 
ful, with shoulders so wide they 
seemed out of proportion to his 
hips and legs. 



Weiner said, “So you’re here. 
I really thought you had more 
sense.” 

“We’re determined people, 
Freeman Weiner.” 

“So I know. I’ve been study- 
ing your ways for a long time.” 
Weiner’s eyes became remote. 
“More than sixty years, in fact. 
I knew your Coordinator Kirby 
before his conversion, did he 
ever tell you that?” 

“He didn’t mention it,” Mar- 
tell said. His flesh crept. Kirby 
had joined the Vorster Brother- 
hood about twenty years before 
Martell had been born. 

To live a century was nothing 
unusual these days. Vorst him- 
self was surely into his thirteen- 
th or fourteenth decade. But it 
was chilling all the same to 
think of such a span of years. 

Weiner smiled. “I came to 
Earth to negotiate a trade deal, 
and Kirby was my chaperone. 
He was with the U.N. then. I 
gave him a hard time. I was a 
drinker, then. Somehow I don’t 
think he’ll ever forget that 
night.” His gaze riveted on Mar- 
tell’s unblinking eyes. “I want 
you to know, Brother, that I 
can’t provide any protection for 
you if you’re attacked. My re- 
sponsibility extends only to Mar- 
tian nationals.” 

“I understand.” 

“My advice is the same as it’s 
been from the start. Go back to 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



101 



Earth and live to a ripe old age.” 
“I can’t do that, Freeman 
Weiner. I’ve come with a mis- 
sion to accomplish.” 

“Ah, dedication! Wonderful! 
Where will you build your chap- 
el?” 

“On the road leading to town. 
Perhaps closer to town than the 
Harmonist place.” 

“And where will you stay un- 
til it’s built?” 

“I’ll sleep in the open.” 
“There’s a bird here,” Weiner 
said. “They call it a shrike. It’s 
as big as a dog, and its wings 
look like old leather, and it has 
a beak like a spear. I once saw 
it dive from five hundred feet 
at a man taking a nap in an 
open field. The beak pinned 
him to the ground.” 

Unperturbed, Martell said, “I 
survived an encounter with a 
Wheel today. Perhaps I can 
dodge a shrike too. I don’t in- 
tend to be frightened away.” 
Weiner nodded. “I wish you 
luck,” he said. 

V 

uck was about all Martell 
was going to get from the 
Ambassador, but he was grateful 
even for that. The Martians were 
cool toward Earth and all it 
produced, including its reli- 
gions. They did not actually hate 
Earthmen, as the Venusians of 



both castes appeared to do; the 
Martians were still Earthlike 
themselves, and not changed 
creatures whose bond with the 
mother world was tenuous at 
best. But the Martians were 
tough, aggressive frontiersmen 
who looked out only for them- 
selves. They served as go- 
betweens for Earth and Venus 
because there was profit in it; 
they accepted missionaries from 
Earth because there was no harm 
in it. 

Martell left the Martian Em- 
bassy and set about his tasks. 

He had money and he had 
energy. He could not hire Ve- 
nusian labor directly, because it 
would be an act of pollution 
for a Venusian even of the low 
caste to work for an Earthman, 
but it was possible to commis- 
sion workmen through Weiner. 
The Martians, naturally, receiv- 
ed a fee for serving as agents. 

Workmen were hired and a 
modest chapel was erected. Mar- 
tell set up his pocket-sized reac- 
tor and readied it for use. Alone 
in the chapel, he stood in silence 
as the Blue Fire flickered into 
glowing life. 

Martell had not lost his capac- 
ity for awe. He was a worldly 
man, no mystic; yet the sight 
of the radiation streaming from 
the water-shielded reactor work- 
ed its magic on him, and he 
dropped to his knees, touching 



102 



GALAXY 



his forehead in the gesture of 
submission. He could not carry 
his religious feeling to the stage 
of idolatry, as the Harmonists 
did, but he was not without a 
sense of the might of the move- 
ment to which he had pledged 
his life. 

The first day, Martell simply 
carried out the ceremonies of 
dedication. On the second and 
third and fourth, he waited 
hopefully for some low-caster 
who might be curious enough to 
enter the chapel. None came. 

Martell did not care to seek 
worshippers, not just yet. He 
preferred that his converts be 
voluntary, if possible. The chap- 
el remained empty. On the fifth 
day, it was entered — but only 
by a frog-like creature ten inches 
long, armed with wicked little 
horns on its forehead and deli- 
cate, deadly-looking spines that 
sprouted from its shoulders. 
Were there no life-forms on this 
planet that went without armor 
or weaponry, Martell wonder- 
ed? He shooed the frog out. It 
growled at him and lunged at 
his foot with its horns. Martell 
drew his foot back barely in 
time, interposing a chair. The 
frog stabbed at the wood, sank 
inch-deep with the left hom; 
when it withdrew, an iridescent 
fluid trickled down the leg of 
the chair, burning a pathway 
through the wood. Martell had 



never been attacked by a frog 
before. On the second try, he 
got the animal out the door with- 
out suffering harm. A pretty 
planet, he thought. 

erNie next day came a more 
-*■ cheering visitor: the boy 
Elwhit. Martell recognized him 
as one of the boys who had been 
teleporting dirt behind the Har- 
monist place. He appeared from 
nowhere and said to Martell, 
“You’ve got Trouble Fungus out 
there.” 

“Is that bad?” 

“It kills people. Eats them. 
Don’t step in it. Are you really 
a religious?” 

“I like to think so.” 

“Brother Christopher says you 
shouldn’t be trusted, that you’re 
a heretic. What’s a heretic?” 

"A heretic is a man who dis- 
agrees with another man’s re- 
ligion,” Martell said. “I happen 
to think Brother Christopher’s 
the heretic, as a matter of fact. 
Would you like to come inside?” 
The boy was wide-eyed, end- 
lessly curious, restless. Martell 
longed to question him about 
his apparent telekinetic powers, 
but he knew it was more im- 
portant at the moment to snare 
him as a convert. Questions at 
this point might only frighten 
him away. Patiently Martell ex- 
plained what the Vorsters had 
to offer. 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



103 



It was hard to gauge the boy’s 
reaction. Did abstract concepts 
mean anything to a ten-year- 
old? Martell gave him Vorst’s 
book, the simple • text. The boy 
promised to come back. 

“Watch out for the Trouble 
Fungus,” he said as he left. 

A few days passed. Then the 
boy returned, with the news that 
Mondschein had confiscated his 
book. 

Martell was pleased at that, 
in a way. It was a sign of panic 
among the Harmonists. Let them 
turn Vorster teachings into 
something forbidden, and he’d 
win all of Mondschein’s four 
thousand converts away. 

Two days after Elwhit’s sec- 
ond visit, Martell had a differ- 
ent caller, a broad-faced man in 
Harmonist robes. Without intro- 
ducing himself he said* “You’re 
trying to steal that boy, Martell. 
Don’t do it.” 

“He came of his own free 
will.” 

“The child has curiosity. But 
he’s the one who’ll suffer if you 
keep allowing him to come here. 
Turn him away the next time, 
Martell. For his own sake.” 

“I’m trying to take him away 
from you for his own sake,” the 
Vorster replied quietly. 

“You’ll destroy him,” said the 
Harmonist. “Turn him away.” 

Martell did not intend to 
yield. Elwhit was his opening 



wedge into Venus, and it would 
be madness to turn him away. 

Later that same day there 
came another visitor, no friend- 
lier than the horned frog. He 
was a burly Venusian of the 
lower caste, with armpit-daggers 
bristling on both sides of his 
chest. He -had not come to wor- 
ship. He pointed to the reactor 
and said, “Shut that thing off 
and dispose of the fissionables 
within ten hours.” 

A 4T artell frowned. “It’s neces- 
sary to our religious ob- 
servance.” 

“It’s fissionables. Not allowed 
to run a private reactor here.” 

“There was no objection at 
customs,” Martell pointed out. 
“I declared the cobalt-60 for 
what it v/as and explained 
the purpose. It was allowed 
through.” 

“Customs is customs. You’re in 
town now. I say no fissionables. 
You need a permit to do what 
you’re doing.” 

“Where do I get a permit?” 
asked Martell mildly. 

“From the police. I’m the 
police. Request denied. Shut 
that thing off.” 

“And if I don’t?” 

For an instant Martell thought 
the self-styled policeman would 
stab him on the spot. The man 
drew back as though Martell had 
spat in his face. After an ugly 



104 



GALAXY 



silence he said, “Is that a chal- 
lenge?” 

“It’s a question.” 

“I ask you on my authority 
to get rid of that reactor. If 
you defy my authority you’re 
challenging me. Clear? You 
don’t look like a fighting man. 
Be smart and do as I say.” 

He went out. 

Martell shook his head sadly. 
Law enforcement a matter of 
personal pride? Well, it was 
only to be expected. More to the 
point: they wanted his reactor 
off, and without the reactor his 
chapel would not be a chapel. 
Could he appeal? To whom? If 
he dueled with the intruder and 
slew him, would that give him 
the right to run the reactor? 
He could hardly take such a step 
anyway. 

Martell decided not to give up 
without a struggle. He sought 
the authorities, or what passed 
for authorities here, and after 
spending four hours waiting to 
be admitted to the office of a 
minor official he was told clear- 
ly and coldly to dismantle his 
reactor at once. His protests were 
dismissed. 

Weiner was no help either. 
“Shut the reactor down,” the 
Martian advised. 

“I can’t function without it,” 
said Martell. “Where’d they get 
this law about private operations 
of reactors?” 



“They probably invented it to 
take care of you,” Weiner sug- 
gested amiably. “There’s no help 
for it, Brother. You’ll have to 
shut down.” 

Martell returned to the chap- 
el. He found Elwhit waiting on 
the steps. The boy looked dis- 
turbed. 

“Don’t close,” he said. 

“I won’t.” Martell beckoned 
him inside. “Help me, Elwhit. 
Teach me. I need to know.” 
“What?” 

“How do you move things 
around with your mind?” 

“I reach into them,” the boy 
said. “I catch hold of what’s 
inside. There’s a strength. It’s 
hard to say.” 

“Is it something you were 
taught to do?” 

“It’s like walking. What makes 
your legs move? What makes 
them stand up underneath you?” 

1^ /f"artell simmered with frus- 
-LVA tration. “Can you tell me 
what it feels like?” 

“Warm. On top of my head. 
I don’t know. I don’t feel much. 
Tell me about the electron. 
Brother Nicholas. Sing the song 
of photons to me.” 

“In a moment,” Martell said. 
He crouched down to get on the 
boy’s eye-level. “Can your moth- 
er and father move things?” 

“A little. I can move them 
more.” 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



105 



“When did you find out you 
could do it?” 

“The first time I did it.” 

“And you don’t know how 
you — ” Martell paused. What 
was the use? Could a ten-year-old 
boy find words to describe a 
telekinetic function? He did it 
as naturally as he breathed. The 
thing to do was to ship him to 
Earth, to Santa Fe, and let the 
Noel Vorst Center for the Bio- 
logical Sciences have a look at 
him. Obviously that was impos- 
sible. The boy would never go, 
and it would hardly be proper 
to spirit him away. 

“Sing me the song,” Elwhit 
prodded. 

“In the strength of the spec- 
trum, the qitantum, and the holy 
angstrom — ” 

The chapel door flew open 
and three Venusians entered: 
the police chief and two depu- 
ties. The boy pivoted instantly 
and skittered past them, out the 
back way. 

“Get him!” the police chief 
roared. 

Martell shouted a protest. It 
was useless. The two deputies 
pounded after the boy, into the 
yard. Martell and the police 
chief followed. 

The deputies closed in on the 
boy. Abruntly, the meatier one 
was flmning through the air, 
legs kicking violently as he head- 
ed for the deadly patch of Trou- 




ble Fungus in the underbrush. 

He landed hard. There was a 
muffled groan. Trouble Fungus, 
Martell had learned by watching 
it, moved quickly. The carnivor- 
ous mold would devour anything 
organic; its sticky filaments, 
triggering with awesome speed, 
went to work instantly. The dep- 
uty was trapped in a network of 
loops whose adhesive enzymes 
immediately began to operate. 
Struggling only made it worse. 
The man thrashed and tugged, 
but the loops multiplied, stap- 
ling him to the ground. And now 
the digestive enzymes were com- 
ing into play. 

A sweet, sickly odor rose from 
the Trouble Fungus clump. 



106 



GALAXY 




Martell had no time to study 
the process of dissolution. The 
man caught in his fatal collars 
of slime was close to death, and 
the surviving deputy, his face 
almost black with fear and rage, 
had drawn a knife on the boy. 

Elwhit knocked it out of his 
hand. He tried to gather strength 
for another cast into the fungus 
patch, but his face was sweat- 
speckled, and bunching muscles 
in his cheeks told of the inward 
struggle. The deputy rocked and 
swayed, resisting the telekinesis. 
Martell stood frozen. The police 
chief bounded forward, knife on 
high. 

“Elwhit 1” Martell screamed. 

Even a telekinetic has no way 



of defending himself against a 
stab in the back. The blade went 
deep. The boy dropped. In the 
same moment, with the pressure 
withdrawn, the deputy slipped 
and fell on his face. The chief 
seized the wounded, convulsing 
boy and hurled him into the 
Trouble Fungus. He landed be- 
side the soft mass of the dead 
deputy, and Martell watched in 
horror as the sinister loops lock- 
ed into place. Sickness assailed 
him. He ran halfway through 
the disciplinary techniques be- 
fore his mind would work prop- 
erly again. 

T)y then, the police chief and 
his deputy had recovered 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



107 




their calmness. With scarcely a 
look at the two dissolving 
corpses, they seized Martell and 
hauled him back into the chapel. 

“You killed a boy,” Martell 
said, breaking loose. “Stabbed 
him in the back. Where’s your 
honor?” 

“I’ll settle that before our 
court, priest. The boy was a mur- 
derer. And under the spell of 
dangerous doctrines. He knew 
we were closing you down. It 
was a violation to be here. Why 
isn’t that reactor off?” 

Martell groped for words. He 
wanted to say that he did not 
intend to accept defeat, that he 
was staying on here, determined 
to fight even to the point of 
martyrdom despite their order 
that he shut up shop. But the 
brutal killing of his only con- 
vert had smashed his will. 

“I’ll shut the reactor down,” 
he said hollowly. 

“Go and do it.” 

Martell dismantled it. They 
waited, exchanging pleased 
glances when the light flickered 
out. The deputy said, “It isn’t 
a real chapel without the light 
burning, is it, priest?” 

“No,” Martel replied. “I’m 
closing the chapel too, I guess.” 
“Didn’t last long.” 

“No.” 

The chief said, “Look at him 
with his gills flapping. All 
tricked out to look like one of 

108 



us, and who’s he fooling? We’ll 
teach him.” 

They moved in on him. They 
were burly, powerful men. Mar- 
tell was unarmed, but he had no 
fear of them. He could defend 
himself. They neared him, two 
nightmare figures, grotesquely 
inhuman, their eyes bright and 
slitted, inner lids sliding tensely 
up and down, small nostrils 
flickering, gills atremble. Mar- 
tell had to force himself to re- 
member that he was a monster 
as much as they; he was a 
changed one now. Their brother. 

“Let’s give him a farewell par- 
ty,” the deputy said. 

“You’ve made your point,” 
said Martell. “I’m closing the 
chapel. Do you need to attack 
me, too? What are you afraid 
of? Are ideas that dangerous to 
you?” 

A fist crashed into the pit of 
his stomach. Martell swayed, 
caught his breath, forced him- 
self to remain cool. The edge of 
a hand chopped at his throat. 
Martell slapped at it, deflected 
it and seized the wrist. 

There was a momentary ex- 
change of ions and the deputy 
fell back, cursing. 

“Look out! He’s electric!” 

“I mean no harm,” said Mar- 
tell mildly. “Let me go in peace.” 

Hands went to daggers. Mar- 
tell waited. 

The Venusians dropped back, 

GALAXY 



apparently willing to let the 
matter end here. They had, after 
all, succeeded in throttling the 
Vorster mission. Now they ap- 
peared to have qualms about 
dealing with the defeated mis- 
sionary. 

“Get yourself out of town, 
Earthman,” the police chief 
grumbled. “Go where you be- 
long. Don’t come mucking 
around here with your phony 
religion. We aren’t buying any.” 

VI 

np'here was no blackness quite 
like the black of the night 
sky of Venus, Martell thought. 
It was like a layer of wool 
swathing the vault of the heav- 
ens. Not a hint of a star, not 
a flicker of a moonbeam, cut 
through that arch of darkness 
overhead. Yet there was light, 
occasional and intermittent : 

great predatory birds, hellishly 
luminous, skewered the darkness 
at unpredictable moments. 

Standing on the rear veranda 
of the Harmonist chapel, Mar- 
tell watched a glowing creature 
soar past no higher than a hun- 
dred feet up. It was near enough 
for Martell to see the row of 
hooked claws that studded the 
leading edges of the curved, 
back-swept wings. 

“Our birds have teeth as well,” 
said Christopher Mondschein. 



“And the frogs have horns,” 
Martell remarked. “Why is this 
planet so vicious?” 

Mondschein chuckled. “Ask 
Darwin, my friend. It just hap- 
pened that way. You’ve met our 
frogs, then? Deadly little beasts. 
And you’ve seen a Wheel. We 
have amusing fish, too. And car- 
nivorous fungi. But we are with- 
out insects. Can you imagine 
that? No land arthropods at all. 
Of course, there are some de- 
lightful ones in the sea — a kind 
of scorpion bigger than a man, 
a sort of lobster with disturb- 
ingly large claws — but no one 
goes into the sea, here.” 

“I understand why,” Martell 
said. Another luminescent bird 
swooped down, skimmed the 
trees, and rocketed away. From 
its flat head jutted a glowing 
fleshy organ the size of a melon, 
wobbling on a thick stem. 

Mondschein said, “You wish to 
join us after all?” 

“That’s right.” 

“Infiltrating, Martell? Spy- 
ing?” 

Color came to Martell’s 
cheeks. The surgeons had left 
him with the flush reaction, al- 
though he turned a dull gray 
when affected now. “Why do 
you accuse me?” he asked. 

“Why else would you want to 
join us? You were haughty about 
it last week.” 

“That was last week. My chan- 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



109 



el is closed. I saw a boy who 
trusted me killed before my eyes. 
I have no wish to see more such 
murders.” 

“So you admit that you were 
guilty in his death?” 

4tT admit that I allowed him 
-H- to jeopardize his life,” 
Martell said. 

“We warned you of it.” 

“But I had no idea of the 
cruelty of the forces that would 
strike at me. Now I do. I can’t 
stand alone. Let me join you, 
Mondschein.” 

“Too transparent, Martell. 
You came here bristling with 
the urge to be a martyr. You 
gave up too soon. Obviously you 
want to spy on our movement. 
Conversions are never that sim- 
ple, and you’re not an easily 
swayed man. I suspect you, 
Brother.” 

“Are you esping me?” 

“Me? I don’t have a shred of 
ability. Not a shred. But I have 
common sense. I know a bit 
about spying, too. You’re here 
to sniff.” 

Martell studied a gleaming 
bird high against the dark back- 
drop. “You refuse to accept me, 
then?” 

“You can have shelter for the 
night. In the morning you’ll 
have to go. Sorry, Martell.” 

No amount of persuasion 
would alter the Harmonist’s de- 



cision. Martell was not surprised, 
nor greatly distressed; joining 
the Harmonists had been a strat- 
egy of doubtful success, and he 
had more than half expected 
Mondschein to reject him. Per- 
haps if he had waited six months 
before applying. 

He remained aloof while the 
little group of Harmonists per- 
formed evening vespers. They 
were not called “vespers,” of 
course, but Martell could not 
avoid identifying the heretics 
with the older religion. Three 
altered Earthmen were stationed 
at the mission, and the voices 
of the two subordinates joined 
with Mondschein’s in hymns 
that seemed offensive in their 
religiosity and yet faintly mov- 
ing at the same time. Seven low- 
caste Venusians took part in the 
service. Afterward, Martell 
shared a dinner of unknown 
meat and acrid wine with the 
three Harmonists. They seemed 
comfortable enough in his pres- 
ence, almost smug. One, Brad- 
laugh, was slim and fragile- 
looking, with elongated arms 
and comically blunt features. 
The other, Lazarus, was robust 
and athletic, his eyes oddly 
blank, his skin stretched mask- 
tight over his broad face. He 
was the one who had visited 
Martell’s ill-fated chapel. Mar- 
tell suspected that Lazarus was 
an esper. 



no 



GALAXY 



“Are you related to the Laz- 
arus?” Martell asked. 

“His grand-nephew. I never 
knew the man.” 

“No one seems to have known 
him,” said Martell. “It often 
occurs to me that the esteemed 
founder of your heresy may 
have been a myth.” 

F aces stiffened around the 
table. Mondschein said, “I 
met him once, a few weeks after 
I changed from a blue tunic to 
a green one. He came to see me 
as I was about to undergo sur- 
gery to fit me for Venus. An 
impressive man, he was: tall and 
commanding, with an air of maj- 
esty.” 

“Like Vorst,” Martell said. 
“Very much like Vorst. Nat- 
ural leaders, both of them.” 
Martell said, “Vorst came to 
me. Just before my operation. 
It seems to be the custom.” 

“A reassuring custom,” said 
Mondschein. He rose. “Brothers, 
good night.” 

Martell was left alone with 
Bradlaugh and Lazarus. An 
uncomfortable silence followed; 
after a while Bradlaugh said 
stiffly, “I’ll show you to your 
room.” 

The room was small, with a 
simple cot. Martell was content. 
Fewer religious symbols decor- 
ated the room than there might 
have been, and it was a place 



to sleep. He took care of his 
devotions quickly and closed his 
eyes. After a while, sleep came 
— a thin crust of slumber over 
an abyss of turmoil. 

The crust was pierced. 

There came the sound of 
laughter, booming and harsh. 
Something thumped against the 
chapel walls. Martell struggled 
to wakefulness in time to hear 
a thick voice cry, “Give us the 
Vorster!” 

He sat up. Someone entered 
his room: Mondschein, he real- 
ized. “They’re drunk,” the Har- 
monist whispered. “They’ve 
been roistering all over the 
countryside all night, and now 
they’re here to make trouble.” 

“The Vorster!” came a roar 
from outside. 

Martell peered through his 
window. At first he saw nothing: 
then, by the gleam of the light- 
cells studding the chapel’s outer 
walls, he picked out seven or 
eight titanic figures, striding un- 
steadily back and forth in the 
courtyard. 

“High-casters!” Martell gasp- 
ed. 

“One of our espers brought 
the word an hour ago,” said 
Mondschein. “It was bound to 
happen sooner or later. I’ll go 
out and calm them.” 

“They’ll kill you.” 

“It’s not me they’re after.” 
said Mondschein, and left. 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



111 



A /f artell saw him emerge from 
the building. He was 
dwarfed by the ring of drunken 
Venusians, and from the way 
they closed in on him, Martell 
was certain that they would do 
him some harm. 

But they hesitated. Mond- 
schein faced them squarely. At 
this distance, Martell could not 
hear what they were saying. A 
parley of some sort, perhaps. The 
big men were armed and 
reeling. Some glowing creature 
shot past the knot of figures, 
giving Martell a sudden glimpse 
of the faces of the high-caste 
men: alien, distorted, terrifying. 
Their cheekbones were like 
knifeblades; their eyes mere 
slits. Mondschein, his back to 
the window now, was gesticulat- 
ing, no doubt talking rapidly 
and earnestly. 

One of the Venusians scooped 
up a twenty-pound boulder and 
lobbed it against the mission’s 
whitewashed wall. Martell nib- 
bled a knuckle. Fragments of 
conversation came to him, ugly 
words : “Let us have him . we 
could take you all . time we 
crushed all you toads . .” 

Mondschein’s hands were up- 
raised, now. Imploringly, Mar- 
tell wondered, or was he simply 
trying to keep the Venusians at 
bay? 

Martell thought of praying. 
But it seemed a hollow, futile 



gesture. One did not pray for 
direct reward, in the Brother- 
hood. One lived well, and served 
the cause, and reward came. 
Martell slipped into his robe 
and went outside. 

Never before had he been 
this close to a group of high- 
casters. There was a rank odor 
about them, an odor that re- 
minded Martell of the scent of 
the Wheel. 

“What do they want?” Mar- 
tell asked. 

Mondschein gaped at him. 
“Go back inside! I’m negotiating 
with them!” 

One of the Venusians unfurled 
a sword. He drove it a foot into 
the spongy earth, leaned on it 
and said, “There’s the priestling 
now! What are we waiting for?” 

Mondschein said helplessly to 
Martell, “You shouldn’t have 
come out. There might have 
been a chance to quiet them.” 

“They’ll destroy your whole 
mission here if I don’t pacify 
them. I’ve got no right to bring 
that on you.” 

“You’re our guest,” Mond- 
schein reminded him. 

Martell did not care to accept 
the charity of heretics. He had 
come to the Harmonists, as they 
had guessed, in the hope of spy- 
ing; that had failed, as had the 
rest of his mission here, and He 
would not hide behind Mond- 
schein’s green robe. He caught 



112 



GALAXY 



the older man’s arm and said, 
“Go inside. Fast!” 

Mondschein shrugged and dis- 
appeared. Martell swung round 
to face the Venusians. 

“Why are you here?” he 
asked. 



\ gob of spittle caught him 
-**• in the face. Without speak- 
ing directly to him, one Venus- 
ian said, “We’ll skewer him and 
throw him in Ludlow Pond, 
eh?” 



“Hack him! Spit him!” 
“Stake him out for a Wheel!” 
Martell said, “I came here in 
peace. I bring you the gift of 
life. Why won’t you listen? 
What are you afraid of?” They 
were big children, he saw, revel- 
ling in their power to crush an 
ant. “Let’s all sit down by that 
tree. Allow me to talk to you 
for a while. I’ll take the drunk- 
enness out of you. If you’ll only 
give me your hand — ” 

“Watch out!” a Venusian 
roared. “He stings!” 

Martell reached for the near- 
est of the giants. The man leaped 
back with a most ungallant dis- 
play of edginess. An instant 
later, as though to atone for 
bolting that way, his sword was 
out, a glittering anachronism 
nearly as long as Martell itself. 
Two Venusians drew their dag- 
gers. They strutted forward, and 
Martell filled his altered lungs 



with alien air and waited for 
the shedding of his no-longer red 
blood, and then suddenly he was 
no longer there. 

“How did you get here?” Am- 
bassador Nat Weiner asked. 

“I wish I knew,” said Martell. 

The sudden brightness of the 
Martian’s office stabbed at Mar- 
tell’s eyes. He still could see the 
descending blades of the fear- 
some swords, and he was rocked 
by a sensation of unreality, as 
though he had left one dream 
to enter another in which he was 
dreaming yet a different thread. 

“This is a maximum-security 
building,” said Weiner. “You 
have no right to be here.” 

“I have no right even to be 
alive,” replied the missionary 
flatly. 



VII 

B roodingly, Martell consider- 
ed retreating to Earth to 
tell Santa Fe what he knew. 

He could go to the Vorst 
Center, where, less than a year 
ago, he had gone into a room 
as an Earthman, to be turned 
by whirling knives and lashing 
lasers into an alien thing. He 
could request an interview with 
Reynolds Kirby, and let that 
grizzled, thin-lipped centenarian 
know that the Venusians had 
telekinesis, that they could de- 
flect a Wheel or throw an at- 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



113 



tacker into Trouble Fungus or 
speed a living human figure 
safely across five miles and pass 
him through walls. 

Santa Fe would have to know. 

The situation looked bad. Har- 
monists snugly established on 
Venus, and the place chock full 
of teleports — it could mean a 
disastrous blow to Vorst’s master 
plan. Of course, the Vorsters on 
Earth had made great gains too. 
They were masters of the planet. 
Their laboratories had run simu- 
lated lifespans that showed a 
tally of three to four hundred 
years, without organ replace- 
ment — simple regeneration 
from within, amounting to a 
kind of immortality. But im- 
mortality was only one Vorster 
goal. The other was transport to 
the unreachable stars. 

And there the Harmonists had 
their big lead. They had tele- 
ports who already could work 
miracles. Given a few genera- 
tions of genetic work, they might 
be sending expeditions to other 
solar systems. Once you could 
move a man five miles in safety, 
it was only a quantitative jump, 
not qualitative, to get him to 
Procyon. 

Martell had to tell them. Santa 
Fe called to him — that vast 
sprawl of buildings where tech- 
nicians split genes and labori- 
ously pasted them back together, 
where e3per families submitted 



to an endless round of tests, 
where bionics men performed 
wonders beyond comprehension. 

But he did not go. 

A personal report seemed un- 
necessary. A message cube would 
do just as well. Earth now was 
an alien world to Martell, and 
he was uneasy about returning 
to it, living in breathing-suits. 
He balked at making the return 
journey. 

Through the good offices of 
Nat Weiner, Martell recorded a 
cube and had it shipped to Kir- 
by at Santa Fe. He remained at 
the Martian Embassy while wait- 
ing for his reply. He had set 
forth the situation on Venus as 
he understood it, expressing his 
great fear that the Harmonists 
have the stars. 

In time Kirby’s reply arrived. 
He thanked Martell for his in- 
valuable data. And he expressed 
a calming note: the Harmonists, 
he said, were men. If they were 
to reach the stars, it would be 
a human achievement. Not 
theirs, not ours, but everyone’s, 
for the way would be opened. 
Did Brother Martell follow that 
reasoning, Kirby asked? 

Martell felt quicksand be- 
neath him. What was Kirby say- 
ing? Means and ends were hope- 
lessly jumbled. Was the purpose 
of the order fulfilled if heretics 
conquered the universe? In dis- 
tress, he stood before the im- 



114 



GALAXY 



provised altar in the room 
Weiner had given him, seeking 
answers to unaskable questions. 

A few days later he returned 
to the Harmonists. 

TV /T artell stood with Christo- 
pher Mondschein by the 
edge of a sparkling lake. 
Through the clouds came the 
dull glow of the masked sun, 
imparting a faint gleam to the 
water- that-was-not-water. 

It was not that trickle of sun- 
light that made the water spar- 
kle, though. It teemed with lum- 
inous coelenterates that lined its 
shallow bottom. Their tentacles, 
waving in the currents, emitted 
a gentle greenish radiance. 

There were other creatures in 
the lake, too. Martell saw them 
gliding beneath the surface, rib- 
bed and bony, with gnashing 
jaws and metallic fins. Now and 
then a snout split the water and 
a slim, ugly creature whipped 
twenty yards through the air 
before subsiding. From the 
depths came writhing sucker- 
tipped tendrils that belonged to 
monsters Martell did not care 
to know. 

Mondschein said, “I thought 
I’d never see you again.” 

“When I went out to face the 
Venusians?” 

“No. Afterward, when you 
holed up with the Martians. I 
thought you were making ar- 

WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



rangements to go back to Earth. 
You know it’s hopeless to try 
to plant a Vorster chapel here.” 
“I know,” Martell said. “But 
I’ve got that boy’s death on my 
conscience. I can’t leave. I lured 
him into visiting me, and he 
died for it. He’d be alive if I 
had turned him away. And I’d 
be dead if you hadn’t had one 
of your other little Venusians 
teleport me to safety.” 

“Elwhit was one of our finest 
prospects,” Mondschein said sad- 
ly. “But he had this streak 
of wildness — the thing that 
brought him to us in the first 
place. A restless boy, he was. I 
wish you had left him alone.” 

“I did what I had to do,” Mar- 
tell replied. “I’m sorry it worked 
out so awfully.” 

He followed the path of a 
sinuous black serpent that swept 
from right to left across the lake. 
It extended telescoping arms in 
a sudden terrifying gesture and 
enveloped a low-flying bird. 
Martell said carefully, “I didn’t 
come back here to spy on you. 
I came back here to join your 
order.” 

Mondschein’s domed blue 
forehead wrinkled a little. 
“Please. We’ve been through all 
this already.” 

“Test me! Have one of your 
espers read me! I swear it, Mond- 
schein I’m sincere.” 

“They’ve embedded a pack of 

115 



hypnotic commands in you in 
Santa Fe. I know. I’ve been 
through it myself. They sent you 
here to be a spy, but you don’t 
know it yourself, and if we 
probed you we might have trou- 
ble finding out the truth. You’ll 
soak up all you can about us, 
and then you’ll return to Santa 
Fe and they’ll toss you to a 
debriefing esper who’ll pump it 
all out of you. Eh?” 

“No. Not at all.” 

“Are you sure?” 

“Listen,” said Martell, “I 
don’t think they did anything 
to my mind in Santa Fe. I came 
to you because I belong on 
Venus. I’ve been changed.” He 
held out his hands. “My skin 
is blue. My metabolism is a bi- 
ologist’s nightmare. I’ve got gills. 
I’m a Venusian, and this is 
where the changed ones go. But 
I can’t be a Vorster here, be- 
cause the natives won’t have it. 
Therefore I’ve got to join you. 
Do you see?” 

Mondschein nodded. “I still 
think you’re a spy.” 

“I tell you — ”. 

“Stay calm,” said the Harmo- 
nist. “Be a spy. That’s quite all 
right. You can stay. You can 
join us. You’ll be our bridge, 
Brother. You’ll be the link that 
will span the Vorsters and the 
Harmonists. Play both sides, if 
you like. That’s exactly what we 
want.” 

116 



/^vnce again Martel felt the 
foundations giving way be- 
neath his feet. He imagined him- 
self in a dropshaft with the 
gravity field suddenly gone: 
falling, falling, endlessly falling. 

He peered into the mild eyes 
of the older man and perceived 
that Mondschein must be in the 
grip of some crazy ecumenical 
scheme, some private fantasy 
that — 

He said, “Are you trying to 
put the orders back together?” 
“Not personally. It’s part of 
the plan of Lazarus.” 

Martell thought Mondschein 
was referring to his own assist- 
ant. He said, “Is he in charge 
here or are you?” 

Smiling, Mondschein replied, 
“I don’t mean my Lazarus here. 
I mean David Lazarus, the 
founder of our order.” 

“He’s dead.” 

“Certainly. But we still follow 
the course he mapped for us half 
a century ago. And that course 
envisages the eventual reuniting 
of the orders. It has to come, 
Martell. We each have some- 
thing the other wants. You have 
Earth and immortality. We have 
Venus and teleportation. There’s 
bound to be a pooling of in- 
terests, and possibly you’ll be 
one of the men who’ll help to 
bring it about.” 

“You aren’t serious!” 

“As serious as I know how to 

GALAXY 




be,” said Mondschein. The ami- 
able mask dropped away. “Do 
you want to live forever, Mar- 
tell?” 

“I’m not eager to die. Except 
for some overriding purpose, of 
course.” 

“The translation is that you 
want to live as long as you can, 
with honor.” 

“Right.” 

“The Vorsters are getting 
nearer to that goal every day. 
We have some idea what’s going 
on in Santa Fe. Once, about 
forty years ago, we stole the 
contents of an entire longevity 
lab. It helped us, but not enough. 
We didn’t have the substratum 
of knowledge. On the other 



hand, we’ve made some strides 
too. Will it be worth a reunion, 
do you think? We’ll have the 
stars — you’ll have eternity. Stay 
here and spy, Brother. I think 

— and I know Lazarus thought 

— that the fewer secrets we have, 
the faster our progress will be.” 

Martell did not reply. A boy 
emerged from the woods — a Ve- 
nusian boy, possibly the one 
who had saved him from the 
Wheel, perhaps the dead El- 
whit’s brother. They looked so 
interchangeable in their strange- 
ness. Instantly Mondschein’s 
manner changed. He donned a 
bland smile. 

“Bring us a fish,” he told the 
boy. 



WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



117 



“Yes, Brother Christopher,” he 
said. 

'T'here was silence. Veins 
throbbed on the boy’s fore- 
head. In the center of the lake, 
the water boiled, white foam 
splashing upward. A creature 
appeared, scaly and dull gold in 
color. It hovered in the air, ten 
feet of frustrated fury, its great 
underslung jaw opening and 
closing impotently. The beast 
soared toward the group on the 
shore. 

“Not that one!” Mondschein 
gasped. 

The boy laughed. The huge 
fish slipped back into the lake. 
An instant later, something onal- 
escent throbbed on the ground at 
Martell’s feet, a toothy, snap- 
ping thing a foot and a half 
long, with fins that nearly were 
legs, and a fan-like tail in which 
wicked spikes stirred and quiv- 
ered. 

Martell leaped away, but he 
was in no danger, he realized. 
The fish’s skull caved in as 
though smitten by an invisible 
fist, and it lay still. Martell 
knew terror in that moment. The 
slender, laughing boy, who had 
so mischievously pulled that 
monster from the waters and 
then this equally deadly Httle 
thing, could kill with a flicker 
of his frontal lobes. 

Martell stared at Mondschein. 



“Your pushers — are they all 
Venusians?” 

“All.” 

“I hope you can keep them 
under control!” 

“I hope so too,” Mondschein 
replied. He seized the dead fish 
carefully by a stubby fin, hold- 
ing it so the tail-spikes pointed 
away from him. “A great deli- 
cacy,” he said. “Once we remove 
the poison sacs, of course. We’ll 
catch two or three more and 
have a devilfish dinner tonight 
to celebrate your conversion.” 

VIII 

rr"'hey gave him a room, and 
they gave him menial jobs 
to do, and in their spare time 
they instructed him in the tenets 
of Transcendent Harmony. 

Martell found the room suf- 
ficient and the labor unobjec- 
tionable. It was more difficult 
to swallow the theology. 

He could not pretend, to him- 
self or to them, that it had any 
meaning for him. Warmed-over 
Christianity, a dollop of Islam, 
a tinge of latter-day Buddhism 
— all spread over a structure 
borrowed shamelessly from 
Vorst. It was an unpalatable 
mixture for Martell. There was 
syncretism enough in the Vor- 
ster teachings, but Martell ac- 
cepted those because he had 
been born to them. 



118 



GALAXY 



They began with Vorst, ac- 
cepting him as a prophet just 
as Christianity respected Moses 
and Islam honored Jesus. But, 
of course, there was the later 
dispensation, represented by the 
figure of David Lazarus. 

Vorster writings made no men- 
tion of Lazarus. Martell knew 
of him only from his studies in 
the history of the Brotherhood 
of the Immanent Radiance, 
which mentioned Lazarus in pass- 
ing as an early supporter of 
Vorst’s and then an early dis- 
senter. 

But Vorst lived; and, so said 
both groups, he would live for- 
ever, in tune with the cosmos, 

\ 

the First Immortal. Lazarus was 
dead, a martyr to honesty, cruel- 
ly betrayed and slain by the 
domineering Vorsters in their 
moment of triumph on Earth. 

The Book of Lazarus told the 
sad story; 

"Lazarus was trusting and 
without guile. But the men 
whose hearts were hard came 
upon him and slew him in the 
night, and fed his body to the 
converter so that not even a 
molecule remained. And when 
Vorst learned of their deed, he 
wept and said, I wish you had 
slain me instead, for now you 
have given him an immortality 
he can never lose ...” 

Martell could find nothing in 
the Harmonist scriptures that 

WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



was actually discreditable to 
Vorst. Even the assassination of 
Lazarus itself clearly was shown 
to be the work of underlings, 
carried out without Vorsfs 
knowledge or desire. And 
through the writings ran an ex- 
pression of hope that one day 
the faith would be reunited, 
though it was stressed that the 
Harmonists must submit to uni- 
ty only out of a position of 
strength, and in complete equal- 
ity. 

A few months before, Mar- 
tell would have regarded 
their pretensions as absurd. On 
Earth they were a pipsqueak 
movement, losing members from 
year to year. 

Now, among them if not en- 
tirely of them, he saw that he 
had badly underestimated their 
power. Venus was theirs. The 
high-caste natives might boast 
and swagger, but they were no 
longer the masters. There were 
espers among the downtrodden 
lower caste Venusians — push- 
ers, no less — and they had giv- 
en their destinies into Harmo- 
nist hands. 

Martell worked. He learned. 
He listened. And he feared. 

The stormy season came. From 
the eternal clouds there burst 
tongues of lightning that set all 
Venus ablaze. Torrents of bitter 
rain flailed the flat plains. Trees 

119 



five hundred feet tall were rip- 
ped from the ground and hurled 
great distances. From time to 
time, high-casters arrived at the 
chapel to sneer or to threaten, 
and in the shrieking gales they 
roared their blustering defiance, 
while within the building grin- 
ning low-caste boys waited to 
defend their teachers if neces- 
sary. 

Once, Martell saw three 
high-caste men thrown twenty 
yards back from the entrance 
as they tried to break in. “A 
stroke of lightning,” they told 
one another. “We’re lucky to be 
alive.” 

In the spring came warmth. 
Stripping to his alien skin, Mar- 
tell worked in the fields, Brad- 
laugh and Lazarus beside him. 
He did not yet teach at all. He 
was well versed by now in the 
Harmonist teachings, but it was 
all from the outside in, and a 
seemingly impermeable barrier 
of skepticism prevented it from 
getting deeper. 

Then, on a steamy day when 
sweat rolled in rivers from the 
altered pores of the four former 
Earthmen at the Harmonist 
chapel, Brother Leon Bradlaugh 
joined the blessed company of 
martyrs. It happened swiftly. 
They were in the fields, and a 
shadow crossed above them, and 
a silent voice within Martell 
screamed, “Watch out!” 



T Te could not move. But this 
* was not his day to die. 

Something plummeted from 
the sky, something heavy and 
leather-winged, and Martell saw 
a beak a yard long plunge into 
Bradlaugh’s chest, and there was 
the fountaining of coppery 
blood. Bradlaugh lay outstretch- 
ed with the shrike on him, and 
the great beak was withdrawn, 
and Martell heard a sound of 
rending and tearing. 

They gave the last rites to 
what was left of Bradlaugh. 
Brother Christopher Mond- 
schein presided, and called Mar- 
tell to his side afterward. 

“There are only three of us 
now,” he said. “Will you teach, 
Brother Martell?” 

“I’m not one of you.” 

“You wear a green tunic. You 
know our creed. Do you still 
think of yourself as a Vorster, 
Brother?” 

“I — I don’t know what I am,” 
answered Martell. “I need to 
think about this.” 

“Give me your answer soon. 
There’s much to be done here, 
Brother.” 

Martell did not realize that he 
would know within a day where 
he really stood. A day after 
Bradlaugh’s funeral, the regular 
thrice - weekly passenger ship 
from Mars arrived. Martell knew 
nothing of it, until Mondschein 
came to him and said, “Take 



120 



GALAXY 



one of the boys in the car, and 
do it quickly. A man needs 
saving!” 

Martell did not ask questions. 
Somehow, news had traveled 
down a chain of espers, and it 
was his task simply to obey. He 
entered the car. One of the little 
Venusian acolytes slipped in be- 
side him. 

- “Which way?” Martell asked. 

The boy gestured. Martell 
thumbed the starter. The car 
sped down the road, toward the 
airport. When they had gone 
two and a half miles, the boy 
grunted a command to halt. 

A figure in a blue tunic stood 
by the side of the road, his back 
to the bole of a mighty tree. 
Two suitcases lay open on the 
highway, and a razor-backed 
beast with a flattened snout and 
boar-like tusks was rooting 
through them, while its mate 
charged the newly arrived Vor- 
ster. 

The boy hopped from the car. 
Without sign of strain, he caused 
the two animals to rise and slam 
into trees on the far side of the 
road. They dropped to the 
ground, looking dazed but de- 
termined. The boy levitated 
them again and struck their 
heads together. When they fell 
this time, they swung round and 
fled into the underbrush. 

Martell said, “Venus always 
seems to welcome newcomers 

WHERE THE CHANGED ONES GO 



like that. My greetings commit- 
tee was a thing called a Wheel, 
which I hope you never meet. 
I’d be in ribbons now except 
that a Venusian boy was kind 
enough to teleport it over on 
its side. Are you a missionary?” 

r T n he man seemed too dazed 
to reply immediately. He 
knotted his hands together, re- 
leased them, adjusted his tunic. 
Finally he said. “Yes — yes.” 
“Surgically changed, then?” 
“That’s right.” 

“So am I. I’m Nicholas Mar- 
tell. How are things in Santa 
Fe, Brother?” 

The newcomer’s lips tighten- 
ed. He was a fleshless little man. 
a year or two younger than Mar- 
tell. He said, “How can that 
matter to you, if you’re Martell? 
Martell the heretic? Martell the 
renegade?” 

“No,” Martell said. “I—” 

He fell silent. His hands tense- 
ly smoothed the fabric of his 
Harmonist green tunic. His 
cheeks were burning. He real- 
ized painfully the truth about 
himself, that the change in him 
had worked inward from with 
out, and suddenly he could not 
meet the gaze of his altered 
successor in the Venus mission, 
and he turned, staring into the 
thicket of the no longer very 
alien forest.

Eye of an Octopus

Their job on Mars was to look 
for Martian remains. They had 
not expected to find MartiansJ 



t was a well. 

Henry Bedrosian and 
Christopher Luden bent over the 
lip, peering down into the jet 
darkness. Their balloon-tired 
motorcycle lay forgotten on the 
talcum sand, fine pink sand that 
stretched endlessly away to the 
flat horizon, borrowing its color 
from the sky. The sky was the 
color of blood. It might have 
been a flaming Kansas sunset; 
but the tiny sun was still at the 
zenith. The translucent hewn 
stone of the well-mouth stood 
like a blasphemy in the poison- 
ous wilderness that was Mars. 

It stood four feet above the 
sand, roughly circular, perhaps 
three yards across. The weather- 
ed stones were upright blocks, 



a foot tall by five inches wide 
by perhaps a foot thick. What- 
ever the material of those stones, 
they seemed to glow with a faint- 
ly blue inner light. 

“It’s so human!” said Henry 
Bedrosian. His voice held a 
touch of bewildered frustration, 
echoed by his dark, chisel-nosed 
face. 

Chris Luden knew what he 
meant. “It’s natural. A well’s 
like a lever or a wheel. There 
aren’t many changes you can 
make, because it’s too simple. 
Did you notice the shape of the 
bricks?” 

“Yes. Odd. But they could still 
be man-made.” 

“In this air? Breathing nitric 
oxide, drinking red fuming ni- 

122 



trie acid? But — ” Chris drew, 
a deep breath — “why complain? 
It’s life, Harry! We’ve discover- 
ed intelligent life!” 

“We’ve got to tell Abe.” 

“Right.” 

But it was a long moment 
before either moved. They stood 
leaning over the well, vivid 
green pressure suits against pink 
sand and dark red horizon, peer- 
ing down into the blur of dark- 
ness at the bottom. Then they 
turned to the Mars mobile. 

r jf%e landing vehicle stood 
like an upright steel ball- 
point pen. Its bottom half was 
three spreading legs, a restarting 
solid rocket and a spacious cargo 
hold, two-thirds empty now. The 
upper half was the return-to-or- 
bit stage. Far away across the 
crescent dunes was a white 
patch, the jettisoned drag chute. 

The Marsmobile, a glorified 
two-seater motorcycle with big 
round tires and a number of 
special modifications, putt-putt- 
ed up to a landing leg and 
stopped. Henry got off and 
climbed to the cabin to call Abe 
Cooper in the ion-driven return- 
to-Earth vehicle. Chris Luden 
mounted to the cargo hold and 
rummaged through a disorgan- 
ized hash of necessities until he 
had a long coil of thin line, a 
metal bucket and a heavy rock 
hammer, all treated to resist the 



corrosive atmosphere. He drop- 
ped the objects net to the Mars- 
mobile and climbed down. “Now 
we’ll see,” he told himself. 

Henry descended the ladder. 
“Abe’s having kittens,” he re- 
ported. “He says if we don’t call 
him every five minutes he’ll 
come down after us. He wants 
to know, how old is the well?” 

“So do I.” Chris brandished 
the hammer. “We’D knock a 
chip off and analyze rt Let’s 

_ _ yy 

go- 

The well was a mile and a 
half from the ship, and not of 
a conspicuous color. Probably 
they would have lost it if they 
hadn’t left a flag to mark it. 

“Let’s see how deep it is first,” 
said Luden. He put the hammer 
in the bucket for a weight, tied 
a line to the handle and let it 
fall. In the eery silence of the 
Martian desert they waited. 

The rope was nearly gone 
when the bucket struck some- 
thing. In a moment the ghost 
of a splash came floating up 
from the depths. Henry marked 
the line so they could measure 
how deep it had gone. It looked 
about three hundred feet. They 
hauled it up. 

The bucket was half full of 
a cloudy, slightly oily fluid. 

Chris handed it to his partner. 
“Harry, you want to take this 
back and analyze it?” 

Henry’s dark face grinned 

123 



EYE OF AN OCTOPUS 



around the pointed beard. “I’ll 
match you for it. We both know 
what it’s gonna be.” 

“Sure, but it has to be done. 
Even.” They matched fingers. 
Henry lost. He rode back to the 
ship, the bucket dangling from 
the edge. 

The stone which formed the 
well might have been quartz, 
or even some kind of unveined 
marble. It had been too badly 
weathered, too finely scored and 
polished and etched by the pa- 
tient sand grains, to tell what 
it was. Chris Luden picked a 
likely looking block and brought 
the hammer down hard on what 
seemed to be a crack. He did 
it three times. 

The hammer was ruined. 
Luden shifted the hammer 
this way and that to examine 
the uneven, dulled edge and 
flattened corners. His blue eyes 
held a puzzled look. He knew 
the government might have 
quibbled about the weight of a 
tool for the Mars Project, but 
never the cost or quality. Here 
on Mars that hammer was worth 
at least a million dollars. It 
must be made of some hard, 
durable steel alloy. Then — 

He cocked his head in his 
helmet, tasting a strange idea. 
“Harry!” 

“Yeah?” 

“How you doing?” 

“I’m just coming in the air- 



lock. Give me five minutes to 
find out that this stuff is nitric 
acid.” 

“Okay, but do me a favor. 
Have you got your ring?” 
“The diamond horseshoe? 
Sure.” 

“Bring it back with you, out- 
side your suit. Outside, that is.” 
“Now wait a minute, Chris. 
That’s a valuable ring. Why not 
use your own?” 

“I should have thought of 
that! I’ll just take off my pres- 
sure suit and — Uh! Can’t seem 
to get my helmet unfastened — ” 
“Stop! Stop! I get the point.” 
There was a click as Henry’s 
radio went off. 

Luden sat down to wait. 

r TPhe sun was sliding toward 
the horizon. They had 
landed shortly before sunset yes- 
terday, so they knew how sud- 
denly the desert could turn from 
pink to midnight black, and 
how little light the insignificant 
moons gave. But sundown was 
four hours away. 

The dunes all faced the same 
way, perfect crescents, as regu- 
lar as if hand made. Something 
must shape the winds here, caus- 
ing them to blow always in one 
direction, like Earth’s trade 
winds and the dunes would 
crawl across the sands, slower 
than snails, following the winds. 
How old were the stones 



124 



GALAXY 



against his back? If they were 
really — - a strange and silly 
thought, but Chris wouldn’t have 
volunteered for the Mars Pro- 
ject if he were not half a ro- 
mantic — if they were really dia- 
mond, they must be terrible old, 
to be worn by mere sand. Far 
older than the pyramids, and 
revered ancestor to the Sphinx. 
Maybe the race that carved those 
stones had since perished. Sci- 
ence fiction writers often assum- 
ed an extinct Martian race. 
Why, perhaps the well had ori- 
ginally held water — 

“Hello, Chris?” 

“Here.” 

“It’s dirty nitric acid, not too 
strong. Next time you’ll believe 
me.” 

“Harry, they didn’t send us 
here to make astute guesses. 
They did all the guessing when 
they built the ship. We came to 
find out for sure, right? Right.” 
“See you in ten minutes.” 
Luden let his eyes drift back 
across the desert. It was a mo- 
ment before he realized what 
had caught his eye. 

One of the dunes was irregu- 
lar. The curves were wrong, 
asymmetrical. The normal cres- 
cent had left one sprawling, 
trailing arm. It stood out like 
a pear in a line of apples. 

He had ten minutes, and the 
dune wasn’t far. Luden got up 
and started walking. 



He stood under the dune and 
looked back. The well was clear- 
ly visible. The distance was even 
shorter than he had thought. He 
had been deceived by the near- 
ness of the horizon. 

The lip of the dune was some 
fourteen feet high. 

What had distorted it? An 
upthrusting spire of rock, per- 
haps, not quite high enough to 
show through the sand. They 
could find it with the sonar 
later. 

It had to be under the one 
sprawling, twisted arm of sand. 

“Chris! Where the hell are 
you? Chris!” 

Chris jumped. He’d forgotten 
Henry. “Look due south of the 
well and you’ll see me.” 

“Why don’t you stay where 
you’re put, you idiot? I thought 
you’d been buried by a sand- 
storm.” 

“Sorry, Harry. I got interested 
in something.” Chris Luden was 
now standing on the twisted arm 
of sand. He sounded preoccu- 
pied. “Try scratching the blocks 
of the well with your ring.” 

“That’s an odd thought,” 
Henry laughed. 

“Do it.” 

Silence. Luden felt the wind, 
looked down at the sand, tried 
to imagine what obstruction had 
dropped it here. Something not 
necessarily very large. It would 
not be beneath the dune; it 



EYE Of AN OCTOPUS 



125 



would be on the windward side 
... at the beginning of the arch 
. .there. 

“I scratched it, Chris. There’s 
a scratch all right. So 
that effectively takes . ooops. 
Aaargh! Chris you’re doomed! 
Only death can save you from 
my wrath!” 

“Why are you irritated 
with — ” 

“My diamond! It’s ruined!” 
“Relax. You could replace it 
a million times over with just 
one block from the well.” 

“Say, that’s true. But we’ll 
need the laser to cut it loose. 
They must have used diamond 
dust for the cement, too. And 
the fuel to get it back — ” 
“Harry, do me a favor. 
Bring — ” 

“That last favor cost me a 
three thousand dollar ring!” 
“Bring the Marsmobile here. I 
want to do some digging.” 

“Be right there.” 



A minute later Henry stop- 
-**■ ped the machine along- 
side Chris’s green suit. His smile 
showed that the scratches on his 
ring had not permanently scar- 
red his psyche. “Where do we 
dig?” 

“Right where I’m standing.” 
The Marsmobile was equipped 
with two down-thrusting com- 
pressed air jets for getting over 



steep obstructions. A large tank 
under the vehicle’s belly held 
the heavily compressed air, com- 
pressed directly from the thin 
Martian atmosphere by the mo- 
tor. Henry turned on the jets 
and hovered over the spot where 
Chris had been standing, shift- 
ing his weight to keep the ma- 
chine in place. Sand sprayed out 
in sheets. Chris ran to get out 
from under, and Henry grinned 
and doubled the thrust to send 
the fine grains showering over 
him. 

In half a minute the pres- 
sure became too low. Henry had 
to land. The Marsmobile shud- 
dered and vibrated as its motor 
struggled to refill the pressure 
chamber. 

“I hate to ask,” said Henry, 
“but what’s the point of all 
this?” 

“There’s something solid down 
there. I want you to expose 
it.” 

“Okay, if you’re sure we’re in 
the right place. We’ve got six 
months of time to waste.” 

They wasted a few minutes 
silently watching the Marsmo- 
bile fill its pressure tank. 

“Hey,” said Henry. “You 
think we could stake a claim on 
this diamond mine?” 

Chris Luden, sitting on the 
steep side of the dune, thought- 
fully scratched the side of his 
helmet. ‘Why not? We haven’t 



126 



GALAXY 



seen any live Martians, and it’s 
for sure that nobody else has a 
claim. Sure we’ll file our claim. 
The worst they can do is dis- 
allow it.” 

“One thing. I didn’t mention 
it before because I wanted you 
to see for yourself, but the heck 
with it. One of those blocks is 
covered with deep scratches.” 

“They all are.” 

“Not like these. These are 
deep, and they’re all at forty- 
five degree angles, unless my 
imagination is fooling me. 
They’re too fine to be sure, but 
I think it’s some kind of writ- 
ing.” 

And without waiting for an 
answer, Henry took off on the 
air jets. He was good at it. He 
was like a ballet dancer. You 
could see Henry shifting weight, 
but the scooter never seemed to 
move. 

Something was emerging from 
the sand. 

Something not a rock. 

Something like a piece of 
modern metal sculpture, with no 
use and no meaning but with 
a weird beauty nonetheless. 
Something that had been a ma- 
chine and was now — nothing. 

Henry Bedrosian balanced 
above the conical pit his jets 
had dug. The artifact was almost 
clear now. Something else showed 
beside it. 

A mummy. 



nphe Marsmobile settled on 
the last of its air. Chris 
plunged down the side of the 
pit as Henry climbed off. 

The mummy was humanoid, 
about four feet long, with long 
arms, enormous fragile tapered 
fingers, and a traditionally over- 
sized skull. No fine detail was 
visible; it had all been worn 
away. Chris couldn’t even be 
sure how many fingers the — 
humanoid had had. One hand 
still held two; the other only 
one, plus a fattened opposable 
thumb. No toes showed on the 
feet. The thing lay face down. 

The artifact, now uncovered, 
showed more detail. Yet the 
detail had no meaning. Thick 
bent metal bars, thin twisted 
wires, two enormous crumpled 
circles with something rotted 
clinging to what had been their 
rims — and then Henry’s imagi- 
nation clicked, the same visual 
knack that had gotten him A’s 
in topology, and he said, “It’s a 
bicycle.” 

“You’ve lost your mind.” 

“No, look. The wheels are too 
big, but — ” 

It was a fantastically distorted 
bicycle, with wheels eight feet 
across, a low dwarf-sized saddle 
and a system of gears to replace 
the chain. The gear ratio was 
very low. The saddle was almost 
against the rear wheel, and a 
tiller bar, now bent to scrap, 



EYE OF AN OCTOPUS 



127 



had been fixed to the hub of 
the front wheel. Something had 
crumpled the bicycle like a 
crush-proof cigarette pack in a 
strong man’s hand, and then 
nitric acid rust had done its 
worst to the metal. 

“Okay, it’s a bicycle,” said 
Chris. “It’s a Salvador Dali bi- 
cycle, but still a bicycle. They 
must have been a lot like us, 
hmmm? Bicycles, stone wells, 
writing — ” 

“Clothing.” 

“Where?” 

“It must have been there. He’s 
less worn around the torso, see? 
You can see the wrinkles in his 
skin. He must have been pro- 
tected until his clothes rotted 
away.” 

“Maybe. He kind of ruins our 
lost race theory, doesn’t he? He 
couldn’t possibly be more than 
a couple of thousand years old. 
Hundreds would be more like 
it.” 

“Then he drank nitric acid 
after all! Well, that blows our 
diamond mine, partner. He’s 
got to have living relatives,” Hen- 
ry said. 

“We can’t count on their be- 
ing too much like us. These 
things we’ve found — clothing, 
writing, wells — they’re all 
things any intelligent being 
might be forced to invent. And 
parallel evolution might explain 
the biped shape.” 



“Parallel evolution?” Henry 
repeated. 

“Like the eye of an octopus. 
Lt’s nearly identical in structure 
to a human eye. Yet an octopus 
isn’t remotely human. And look 
at most marsupials, you can’t 
tell them from their mammal 
counterparts. Well, let’s try to 
pick him up.” 

Any archeologist would have 
shot them down in cold blood. 

The mummy was as light and 
dry as cork, and he showed no 
tendency to come apart in their 
hands. They strapped him gent- 
ly over the luggage box and 
climbed on themselves. Chris 
drove back slowly and carefully. 

Chris stood on the first rung 
of the ladder, adjusting the 
mummy’s balance on his left 
shoulder. “We’ll have to spray 
him with plastic before takeoff,” 
he said. “Do we have any plas- 
tic spray?” 

“I don’t remember any. We’d 
better take lots of pictures in 
case it does come apart.” 

“Right. There’s a camera in 
the cabin.” Chris started up, 
and Henry followed. They got 
the relic to the airlock without 
mishap. 

“I’ve been thinking,” said 
Henry. “That nitric acid wasn’t 
diluted, exactly, but there was 
water in it. Maybe this guy’s 
chemistry can extract the water 
from nitric acid.” 



128 



GALAXY 



,r T''hey put the mummy gently 
on a pile of blankets and 
began searching for the camera. 
After five frustrating minutes 
Chris deliberately banged his 
head against a wall. “I took it 
out to catch the sunset last 
night. It’s in the cargo hold.” 
“So get it.” 

Henry stood in the airlock, 
watching as Chris went down 
the ladder. After a moment in 
the cargo space Chris started 
up with the camera strap over 
his shoulder. 

“I’ve been thinking too,” said 
Chris, his voice seemingly dis- 
sociated from his climbing fig- 
ure. “Diamond can’t be that 
plentiful here. And carving it 
into blocks must have been real 
hard labor. Why diamonds? And 
why write on a well?” 

“Religious reasons? Maybe 
they worship water.” 

“That’s what I was thinking.” 
“Of course you were. That 
plot’s as old as Lowell.” 

Chris had reached the top. 
They squeezed into the airlock 
and waited for it to cycle. 

The door opened. Both men 
had their helmets off by this 
time, and they both smelled it 
at once. Something chemical, 
something strong — 

Thick, greasy smoke was pour- 
ing up from the ancient corpse. 

Henry reacted first. He sprang 
for the double boiler in the 



small kitchen corner. The bot- 
tom half was still full of water; 
he snatched it up and threw the 
water over the smoldering Mar- 
tian mummy while with his 
other hand he turned on the 
water faucet to get more. 

The mummy went off like a 
napalm bomb. 

T 1 enry leaped away from the 

-* exploding flames and his 
head rammed something flat and 
very hard. He went down with 
his eyes full of leaping light. 

Immediately he sat up, know- 
ing that something urgently 
needed doing but unable to re- 
member what. He saw Chris, 
still in vacuum suit except for 
the helmet, run through the mul- 
ticolored flames, pick the mum- 
my up by the ankles and throw 
it into the airlock. Chris hit the 
“Cycle” button. The inner door 
swung shut. 

Then Chris was bending over 
him. “Where does it hurt, Har- 
ry? Can you talk? Can you 
move?” 

Henry sat up again. “I’m 
okay.” 

Chris expelled a gusty breath. 

Henry stood up a little shaki- 
ly. His head ached. The fumes 
in the cabin weren’t intolerable, 
and already the air plant was 
whining its eagerness to make 
the air pure and scentless. Red 
smoke from the open outer air-

"The water,” said Chris Lu-

must have! I want to be there

“But what about the well? We 
know he used water,” Henry pro- 
tested. 

“Yes, he did. He sure as hell

\ full year’s worth of these 
columns has now marched 
past, like a herd of migratory 
fern trees. It is time to recapitu- 
late, and to explain. 

First let me explain. Some of 
you have expressed a certain 
bewilderment at the tone I take; 
the occasional bursts of disre- 
spect, the sometimes sly and 
illucid asides. “What is he try- 
ing to say?” they ask, thus be- 
traying the fact we never speak 
of — that a review column these 
days must first of all be a ve- 
hicle for a philosophy of liter- 
ature, and only secondarily a 
guide to my ideas on how your 
book money should be spent. 

Well, my philosophy is much 
involved with the mutually in- 
teresting fact that somewhere in 
every publishing house there is 
a man who sees the making and 



distributing of books as a busi- 
ness. He is called the business 
manager; he can change policy, 
fire editors and thus excommu- 
nicate writers, dictate the pro- 
duction and promotion budget 
and thus stand responsible for 
the $4.95 price-tag on a book 
produced for eighty-seven cents 
and promoted for a dollar. 
While his immortal breed lives, 
all authors, editors and readers 
are involved in a business trans- 
action no different from those 
involving canned soup or paint- 
ed turtles. That is the essential 
fact — all philosophizing, hero 
worship, collecting of incunab- 
ula, fine talk of hobbyistic fel- 
lowship, all, all, are mere detail. 
These people want your money. 
To get it, they will hire the 
services of editors whose person- 
alities and intelligence may be 



131 



more or less attractive, may re- 
flect more or less love or knowl- 
edge of the field, but are gov- 
erned in effect by what is hap- 
pening in the market. Not in 
the temple — in the market. 
Writers know this — perhaps only 
on those difficult days of the fis- 
cal month, but they know it. 

Again, it is fashionable in 
one construct of writingship to 
take the view that we are all 
brethren and sistern; all valiant, 
all virtuous. This view of “D’Ye 
Ken John Peel?” being sung 
around the sacred flame by a 
twinkling band is maintained 
principally by people who get 
farther at literary politics than 
they do behind typewriters. 
(This is a fact gathered by per- 
sonal observation over a period 
of years, and you might as well 
believe it.) It is noteworthy, to 
me, that the writers who con- 
tinue to satisfy the public year 
in and out are solitary warlocks, 
eschewing most pretenses at gen- 
tility, seeking out the company 
of only a selected few of their 
own kind, and then hardly for 
the purpose of scratching each 
other’s backs. 

Rightly or wrongly, these 
people are aware that what they 
sell for money is the same thing 
that gives them a species of 
private ecstasy. They do not al- 
ways like themselves or each 
other. For money and for the 



joy of having created, they are 
in competition with each other 
— that is, with other warlocks. 
All others, they disdain. They 
are in competition with the same 
few they care to know; though 
they have different ways of ex- 
pressing it, some rough and some 
smooth, some sapient and some 
naive, they all know it and re- 
spect and hate each other for 
it, and go a long way to zing 
each other or to help each 
other in various rough ways 
that have nothing to do with 
chaining the daisy. Without ref- 
erence to actual objective talent 
or mort of recognition, they are 
the ones who make the cloud eat 
the moon and the wheat to burst 
forth from the thaw, and their 
pride is such that they die each 
time they muff. 

I n part, this is because they 
are convinced they are in 
a field — whatever their particu- 
lar field — where so many lesser 
creatures do bad work and sing 
hosannah about it in lapping 
voices. There is a sort of blind 
war between them and the 
marshmallow-suckers, whatever 
their field; like all solitary 
things, be they demons or angels, 
they must contend with the fact 
that the suckers will band to- 
gether, thus making the conflict 
more or less even. Out of that 
conflict and out of the nature 



132 



GALAXY 



of proud things and the nature 
of sexton beetles come terribly 
good writing, exciting bad writ- 
ing, smoothly glib writing and 
a great deal of incidental 
dross from people who can do 
it well enough to sell but haven’t 
been around long enough to 
learn whether they are makers 
or users. 

Out of the results of all 
this come the “trends” and 
“directions” in “literature” — 
that is, out of what the makers 
make well, and out of what the 
users can sup from it to keep 
themselves alive until the next 
good thing is made. 

From this rabble of people 
under arms, some of them wear- 
ing parts of salvaged kit from 
either army, all of them “writ- 
ers,” the editors make their se- 
lections and the publishers pack- 
age their products — that is, 
they bet on various remedies of 
warlock, various twinings of 
sucker, and the stability of vari- 
ous compromises that have been 
reached as C models a book on 
what B has done in relation to 
an apparently purely new 
thought by A, which A may 
have thrown away in the core 
of an otherwise worthless short 
story written because he was 
promised the price of his rent 
in exchange for any 1500 words 
that would justify his name on 
the cover. y 



I hope you have always known 
it is these ways; that indepen 
dent of any thrill of invention 
or discovery you may exchange 
among you — reader, writer, ed- 
itor, publisner — there is the 
forest ferment of creativity as 
a thing in itself, and also the 
purse-lipped feasting and sur- 
reptitious salivating, and the 
simple arithmetic of money. I 
hope you have long ago guessed 
that what ties it all together is 
that we are all as much enemies 
as we are friends — that we take 
from each other and prey on 
each other as well as give and 
confer; that there is real terror 
in the heart of a broken warlock 
and the heart of the sucker who 
hears his tread about him, real 
avarice in how they regard each 
other. 

In their lives is grubbi- 
ness as well as real delight and 
glory; the difference between a 
maker’s story of treachery and 
a user’s is that the maker has 
in fact been a traitor in his life 
at some time, and his life is in 
his chosen peers — his treacher- 
ies as well as his vengeances were 
conducted on his kind and him- 
self. As were his loves. And all 
this is sold for money, by him 
as well as by those too polite 
to betray or to love, but not too 
modest to peek. 

Clear? Ah, well, perhaps by 
this time next year .

Out in the context of the 
above, let us recapitulate. 

I would like to announce the 
first annual Galaxy Bookshelf 
awards for pre-eminence in im- 
pressing me with one’s work dur- 
ing the past fiscal year. These 
are given for work published in 
book form, irrespective of any 
previous publication outside 
that format. The actual awards 
consist of one heartfelt oath of 
envy, each, and are collectible 
at the first mutual opportunity 
following this announcement : 

Philip K. Dick, for The Three 
Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, 
the best science-fiction novel of 
the year. (I notice they are 
calling it some kind of half- 
conscious failure, friend.) 

Poul Anderson, for Time and 
Stars, the best collection of the 
year; for “Escape From Orbit,” 
the best short story of the year, 
as published in that collection. 
(That’s two oaths, one of them 
in Lithuanian.) 

Doubleday 85 Company, Inc., 
for The Rest of The Robots (an 
omnibus of Isaac Asimov), the 
single most useful publishing 
idea of the year. 

Donald A. Wollheim, of Ace 
Books, for doing his job. 

Ultimo, I extend an apology 
to various people I have slighted 
and insulted in these pages over 
the past year; forgive me — I 
misunderstood you. 



A yf"any, many years ago, Avram 
-*-*■*■ Davidson and I were in 
-the same racket, he on his side 
of the street, I on mine. I speak 
of the men’s true adventure writ- 
ing business; in my case, “true”. 
He was superb — an exhaustive 
researcher combined with a mas- 
terful prose technician, better, 
if possible, at that than he was 
at fantasy or sf (though he re- 
coils to see that judgment here). 
His articles, mainly for the old 
Cavalier, were genuinely valu- 
able and striking pieces of re- 
portage on such things as the 
charge of the Light Brigade — 
which he did better in his com- 
pass than The R&ason Why did 
in its — and such conscientious, 
painstaking jobs as his piece on 
Sam Woodfill, the World War 
I American soldier who ought 
to have been as well-known as 
Alvin York. 

I inject myself into this review 
of Avram’s Masters of The Maze 
(Pyramid) for three reasons, of 
which the first is that I was 
typical of all of the people I 
knew in that racket except Av- 
ram. I hope I do not totter pub- 
lishing empires by admitting 
that we made it all up about 
Richthofen having been shot 
down because he had his mind 
on a masochistic blonde. We 
rolled our eyes in dumbstruck 
wonder when we saw Avram 
actually writing to real people 



134 



GALAXY 



for personal reminiscences on 
his famous subjects, and travel- 
ing great distances to check his 
facts on the spot. I cannot imag- 
ine he made a profit on it, and 
I doubt his editors realized what 
accounted for his accomplish- 
ments. The second reason is that 
the “true” adventure writer who 
serves as the human protagonist 
for Masters of The Maze is of 
the more numerous breed — a 
hack stuck in his groove, seeking 
yet one more variation on “Love- 
Starved Arabs Raped Me Often,” 
chirping too hard on his bottle 
and wanting nothing to do with 
the dying organization of old 
men who have for so long guard- 
ed Earth against the subtle in- 
vasion of the Chulpex. 

The Chulpex are one of the 
most real, more horrifying men- 
aces from parallel worlds 
dreamed up by a science-fantasy 
writer. John Schoenherr’s cover 
captures one precisely; when I 
read the book, they put me in 
mind of the crunch of dried 
shrimp, but I would not like to 
have the jaws necessary to 
crunch a Chulpex. 

The bare bones of the plot 
are soon-enough told: the Chul- 
pex are inhuman, intelligent 
and avaricious. They live in a 
parallel world. A dimensional 
maze connects many parallel 
universes, obeying its own geome- 
try, providing crossover door- 



ways at odd and unexpected 
places. On Earth, an obscure 
sub-organization of Masonry has 
for many years been guarding 
all the exits from the maze — 
which, by the way, is where 
Ambrose Bierce went — but all 
these people are very old. The 
hack writer is the closest living 
relative of one of them, and he 
is inveigled into taking up his 
inheritance as a guardian before 
he fully understands it. Because 
he is ignorant, a particularly 
avaricious freelance Chulpex 
slips by him on its way to found 
a dynasty of its own — a privi- 
leged Chulpex guard with in- 
eluctable jealousy, bearing such 
wonderful herd-bull names as 
Arristemurriste and Arrettagor 
retta. In his hunt for/flight from 
the maverick, Nathaniel Gordon 
(who may be a friendly gibe at 
Randall Garrett, but see below) 
reaches such places as the land 
of the Red Fish People, which 
is eminently a place where Am- 
brose Bierce would have loved 
to spend his declining years. 
With the aid of these Polynesoid 
but Siniacally scientific people 
a tender maid and others of 
her gender, Gordon enjoys lots 
of luck and a sort of glorifying 
desperation which makes him 
one of the Masters of the Maze 
and thus fit company for Lao- 
Tze (who, with Appolonius of 
Tyana, Benjamin Bathurst and 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



135 



sundry ilk, exists at the Center 
of the maze). Then he goes off 
to accomplish the destruction of 
the Chulpex, and of a right-wing 
Terrestrial statesman who plan- 
ned to use the Maze. 

No/one — no one — but Av- 
ram Davidson could have made 
of this wreck-save-the-world plot 
a thing of such polished beauty 
(if the Baroque is beautiful to 
you). It wafts of the incense of 
scholarship for its own sake, of 
reference both classical and 
fannish, of the ridiculous device 
which is in fact the only plausi- 
ble assertion, once you reflect on 
it — I mean, who else but Ap- 
polonius and Benjamin Bathurst 
. you follow me? I mean — 
well, hell he made me believe 
it — this has got to be the oldest 
sf plot of them all, and to it 
Davidson has brought the store- 
house of his mind, overturned 
it and made a kaleidoscope. 
“Communist Chulpex Ate My 
Wife” Nate Gordon muses as he 
renounces the detached life of 
the Masters and thinks he is go- 
ing to die. He goes to live in- 
stead for six days with the Lost 
Tribes on the shore of the river 
Sambatyon, walking across when 
it rests on the Sabbath, and 
could you have written that? 
You could know about hairy - 
chested men’s adventure titles, 
and conceivably the Lord would 
then let you live long enough to 



also know about the Sambatyon, 
but could you have put them 
both within a paragraph of each 
other in a novel partially about 
the Masonic Order and inciden- 
tally about the political work- 
ings of a Southern town? 

I do not promise you that you 
will enjoy this novel, and if you 
do not. I hope you will not 
weary yourself by plugging 
through it regardless. Though it 
is good as a novel it still has 
marks of the short story writer 
all over it — some of them, as 
indicated, fascinating. But aside 
from being a very fine piece of 
light reading, it promises a lot 
for the Davidson novels of the 
future, and this is, in the style 
of the back-page ads in the 
magazines we used to work, 
Your Chance To Get In On The 
Ground Floor. 

T)y stretching a point only 
■*-' slightly, we could say that 
all three books reviewed this 
time concern themselves with 
Earth’s lonely guardians. David- 
son’s Nate Gordon is the tradi- 
tional Poor Frightened Civilian 
who picks up the trailed string 
and finds himself ultimately un- 
ravelling the Universe; Keith 
Laumer’s Retief is his direct op- 
posite number. 

Galactic Diplomat, Double- 
day, $3.95, is a collection of nine 
Retief stories, from If, and all 



136 



GALAXY 



we ever deduce about Retief the 
man is that something inside 
him can’t help but be affected 
by the fact that his name is 
“fighter” pronounced back- 
wards. Not one blessed other 
thing are we told about what 
he is, as distinct from what he 
does. What he does is solve a 
lot of problems involving a lot 
of alien races who worship gods 
named Uk-Ruppa Tooty; where 
he works is in the Corps Diplo- 
matique Terrestrienne, usually 
as a nominal flunky to ambas- 
sadors named Nitworth. Nit- 
worth (or whoever) blimps his 
way into trouble with one of 
these exotic races, either by be- 
lieving what their rulers tell 
him or by trying to pull the 
wool over their eyes. Retief 
coolly, patiently — and daringly 
— repairs the damage by being 
either in touch with the com- 
mon people or by contravening 
Nitworth’s stupid interpretation 
of Earth’s policy (which is also 
left totally unexplained). Retief 
is always right and Nitworth al- 
ways gets the credit. Retief is 
in short and in this aspect, a 
combination of James Bond and 
Passepartout. James Bond and 
Alexander Botts? Marlon Bran- 
do and Dr. Zorba? 

I must confess I enjoyed the 
daylights out of this book, with- 
out for an instant being able to 
distinguish between one story 



and the next, or any other Re- 
tief stories. The copyright dates 
range faithfully up through the 
years from 1961, and I am sure 
there will be several items here 
you have missed. I would wait 
for the paperback, since four 
bucks is a lot for nine shots 
from the same angle, but I may 
have underestimated your fond- 
ness. 

Y^ominic Flandry (of Flandry 
of Terra, a collection of 
novelettes by Poul Anderson 
Chilton, $3.95) walks the middle 
way; lonely, self-assured, con- 
cerned with his personal integ- 
rity in the service of Earth’s 
corrupt empire, a trace more 
physical than cerebral — but 
very physical — he is the sort of 
series adventure hero who un- 
dermines himself because he is 
too real to have had so many 
things happen to him. But if you 
do not pause to wonder about 
this, the stories about him are 
good — have been good since 
they started coming out in Plan- 
et when Anderson was much 
younger and presumably had not 
yet stopped to think that some- 
day his whipcord-slim, perfectly 
handsome hedonistic hero would 
stop to think: “Well — I suppose 
it all serves the larger good. It 
must. Our noble homosexual 
Emperor s ays so himself .”

of Glory,” opening story in this 
volume. It was first published 
in 1957. “A Message in Secret” 
is from 1959, and the concluding 
story, which takes up half the 
book, is “The Plague of Mas- 
ters,” 1960. 

Back in the days when Flan- 
dry first appeared, he was over- 
shadowed by Anderson’s Planet 
novelettes about thallasocrats 
and autocthones on the ruddy 
seas and plains of Mars. As “A. 
A. Craig,” Anderson was turning 
out these more than adequate 
variations on the theme of Leigh 
Brackett, and so were as many 
other Planet writers as were 
able. Flandry — modelled faint- 
ly after The Saint, not much 
after Northwest Smith and cer- 
tainly not after Brackett’s Rhi- 
annon — was nothing much 
more than a change of pace, and 
as I recall he did not strike the 
proper spark in faithful sf ad- 
venture readers (me). This now 
seems a great pity, though Chil- 
ton is repairing my oversight 
for me, this being the second 
Flandry book from them. 

Anderson, as you must know, 
writes adventure stories with all 
the trappings — dramatic weath- 
er, fantastic but solid settings 
usually with a touch of the 
second-derivative nostalgic to 
them (the cities are like Robin 
Hood’s Nottingham; the free- 
man foresters among the giant 



trees of “Plague” remind one of 
Flash Gordon’s Arborea), sloe- 
eyed ladies of pantherish grace 
or Amazonian warrior-maids 
fighting two-handed, and much 
exploitation of Anderson’s phys- 
ical and social science back- 
ground, which permits the hero 
to be arcanely physical in rela- 
tion to technology. He rides a 
knee-steered motorcycle into 
battle with the motorized no- 
mads of the great steppes of the 
planet Altai; in the same story, 
“A Message in Secret,” he flies 
in the clutch of a giant aero- 
medusa which metabolizes hy- 
drogen. The balance has tipped. 
Flandry is not too seriously out 
of tune with the sort of thing 
Anderson does most often these 
days, and assuming you like 
stories about heroes like, Matt 
Helm — as distinguished from 
stories about heroes like Nero 
Wolfe — you might like Flandry 
rather more than you do Nich- 
olas Van Rijn, though I person- 
ally see no need to prefer one 
over the other. 

In “The Game of Glory,” Flan - 
dry’s assignment is to find and 
kill an agent of the Merseian 
Empire, Earth’s rival. Earth is 
corrupt, its empire great, the 
graft so pervasive that Flandry’s 
methods for staving off the Long 
Night yet one more generation 
are always on the cheap. 

In 1959, (“A Message in Se- 



138 



GALAXY 



cret”), the writing is not as good. 
Too, Flandry does some flatly 
incredible things, such as in- 
stantly being able to ride one 
of those handlebar-less motor- 
bikes at 200 kilometers per hour, 
which I suppose Retief could 
get away with, but then he 
smirks out the secret of how he 
got the vital message to Terra, 
and that’s not like him. Perhaps 
he didn’t care whether the bike 
would kill him; perhaps he was 
ruffled enough at missing the 
girl to want to preen a little 
about the message. 

“The Plague of Master's” is 
about a freelance effort of Flan- 
dry’s — he is not even on assign- 
ment when he investigates the 
mystery of Unan Besar, the Ma- 
laysian planet. Nor has he any 
clear reason for deciding it’s too 
suspicious to pass up. Having 
discovered that the government 
of Unan Besar is a technocracy 
based on the crude fact that only 
the biochemists control the sup- 
ply of monthly antidote pills 
for the planet’s bacteriological 
noison, he goes off wenching 
and adventuring very cleverly, 
with a girl picked up in Act 
Two, and his only real object 
for the longest time is to get 
oi 11s to stay alive with, when 
nothing essential prevented his 



playing Act Eight as Act Three. 
With the Arboreans — sorry; the 
Ranauans — he overthrows Ming 
the — no, Tuan Sola Bandang 
— and . 

Well, I would not have you 
think I’m being snide at Ander- 
son’s expense. But for one rea- 
son or another, the devil-may- 
care hero of the earliest stories 
became the socially conscious 
inner-directed man of 1957, the 
seeker - out - of - extracurricular - 
adventure in 1960. What he gave 
away prodigally in his first flush 
of manhood he regrets in his 
prime, and now he takes It. Per- 
haps he thinks his own Long 
Night is coming. I hope not. I 
like him; he is not the young 
merchant-adventurer or technol 
ogist, nor the hotblood popinjay 
however deadly, one encounters 
so often in Anderson’s settings 
these days. They are all indubi- 
tably heroes, and I recognize 
them, admire them, and will 
read about them in preference 
to many other things. But I like 
Flandry because he is trying to 
do his best with really very few 
skills or backstops in a very 
complicated world; he does it 
so much better than I do that 
I can pleasurably delude myself 
he is like me.

In the Imagieon 



by GEORGE HENRY SMITH 



The world was imaginary, but it 
was vital to his survival — as a 
relief from the world around himl 



T~'\andor leaned back on the 
warm silk of the lounge 
and stretched, letting his eyes 
wander up to the high ceiling 
of his palace and then drop 
down to the blonde who knelt 
at his feet. She was putting the 
finishing touches on his care- 
fully manicured toenails while 
the voluptuous brunette with 
the mobile hips and the full red 
mouth leaned forward to pop 
another grape into his mouth. 

He studied the blonde, whose 
name was Cecily, and thought 
about the other service she had 
performed for him last night. 
That had been nice . very nice. 
But today he felt bored with her. 



just as he was bored with the 
brunette whose name he couldn’t 
remember at the moment, and 
with the cuddly redheaded twins 
and with . 

Dandor yawned. Why were 
they all so damn worshipful and 
always so eager to please? 

It was almost, he thought with 
a wry grin, as though they were 
products of his imagination, or 
rather — and he almost laughed 
aloud — of that greatest of all 
man’s inventions, the Imagieon. 

“There now, don’t they look 
nice?” Cecily said, sitting back 
to admire his finished pedicure 
with pride. 

Dandor looked at the ten shin- 



140 



ing objects of her gaze and gri- 
maced. It made him feel pretty 
silly. 

Then Cecily made him feel 
even sillier by leaning over and 
kissing his right foot with pas- 
sionate red lips. “Oh, Dandor! 
Dandor, I love you so much,” 
she murmured. 

Dandor resisted the tempta- 
tion to use one of his newly 
pampered feet to give her a 
healthy kick on her round little 
bottom. He resisted it because 
even at times like this, when his 
life with these women began to 
seem unreal, he tried to be as 
kind as possible to them. Even 
when their worship and adora- 
tion threatened to bore him to 
death, he tried to be kind. 

So instead of kicking Cecily, 
he yawned. 

The effect was almost the 
same. Her blue eyes widened in 
fear, and the brunette raised 
wide eyes from the grape she 
was peeling, her lips starting to 
tremble. 

“You . you’re going to leave 
us, aren’t you?” Cecily asked. 

He yawned again and patted 
her head absentmindedly. “Just 
for a little while, darling.” 

“Oh, Dandor!” the brunette 
wailed. “Don’t you love us?” 

“Of course I do, but — ” 

“Dandor, please don’t go,” Ce- 
cily begged. “We’ll do anything 
to make you happy!” 



“I know,” he said, getting to 
his feet and stretching. “You’re 
both very sweet. But somehow 
I just feel drawn to — ” 

“Please stay,” the brunette 
pleaded, falling at his feet. 
“We’ll have a party with cham- 
pagne. Any kind of pleasure you 
desire. We’ll go get the other 
girls . 111 dance for you . .” 
“I’m sorry, Daphne,” he said, 
finally remembering her name, 
“but you girls are begin- 
ning to seem unreal to me. And 
when that hapens. I must go.” 
“But — ” Cecily was crying so 
hard she could hardly get the 
words out — “when you leave 
us . it’s a-almost ... as Al- 
though we were . turned off.” 
Her words saddened him a 
little because in a way it was 
true. When he left it was almost 
like turning them off. But true 
or not, he couldn’t do anything 
about it because he felt himself 
being drawn irresistibly toward 
that other world. 

He took one last look around 
at the incredible luxury of his 
palatial palace, at the beauty of 
his women and at the warm sun 
shining through the windows, 
and then he was gone. 

Hphe first tiling he heard 
when he came out of the 
Imagicon was the howling of the 
wind and the first thing he felt 
was the numbing cold. 



IN THE IMAGICON 



141 



The net thing that assaulted 
his ears was the rasping screech 
of his wife’s voice. “So you fi- 
nally came out of it, did you?” 
Nona was yelling. “It’s about 
time, you good-for-nothing little 
runt!” 

So he was really back on Nest- 
rond, back on the coldest hell 
of a colonial world in any uni- 
verse. He had often thought that 
he would never return. But here 
he was . back on Nestrond and 
back with Nona. 

“You’ve been gone long 
enough!” Nona said. She was a 
big, raw-boned woman with 
stringy black hair, a broad, flat 
face with thin lips and uneven, 
yellowish teeth. 

God but she’s ugly, he thought 
as he stared at her. Beside her, 
Cecily and the others are god- 
desses. 

“It’s a good thing you got 
back ’cause the ice wolves is 
actin’ up and we need frozen ice 
moss for the fire and ...” 

Dandor just stood there and 
listened as she went on with the 
long list of chores that needed 
doing. Why, he wondered, didn’t 
she get one of her boy friends 
from down at the mines to do 
these things? He knew without 
being told that her lovers had 
been around while he was 
“gone.” Nona was as faithless as 
she was ugly. And since there 
were twenty men to every wom- 



an on this planet, she had plenty 
of opportunity. 

“. and the cattleshed needs 
a new roof,” she finished. When 
he didn’t answer immediately, 
she thrust her face close to his. 
“Did you hear me? I said there’s 
things to be done!” 

“Yes, I heard you,” he said. 

“Then don’t stand there like 
an idiot. Sit down and eat your 
breakfast and then get out and 
get to work!” 

Breakfast was a thick, greasy 
piece of rancid pork and a bowl 
of lukewarm grits. Dan- 
dor choked on it but finally 
forced it down. Then he put on 
his thermal suit and furs and 
started for the door. 

“Here, stupid!” Nona said, 
picking up a face mask from a 
pile of litter on the table and 
flinging it at him. “You want 
to freeze your nose off?” 

He slapped the mask on quick- 
ly so she wouldn’t see the anger 
on his face, opened the door and 
plunged out. The wind hit him 
in the face, hurling jagged ice 
crystals against his mask. Nest- 
rond! My God, why Nestrond? 
He thought longingly of the 
comparative warmth of the cab- 
in as he stared out at the bleak 
landscape. He thought of the 
black box that was the Imagicon. 
It sat in the one clear corner 
of the cabin and was the only 
way back to . 



142 



GALAXY 



But no, he couldn’t go back 
yet. There were too many things 
to be done here. So with an axe 
over his shoulder, he started 
across the frozen waste to the 
ancient peat bog where they cut 
their fuel. 

All morning long, with the 
wind raging at him and the 
bitter cold making every breath 
an aching torment in his chest, 
he cut and stacked the frozen 
peat. Then when the pale yellow 
sun peeked through the clouds 
of ice crystals for a moment 
and he saw it was almost directly 
overhead, he tied up a large 
bundle of the brick-like slabs 
and hoisted it onto his shoulder 
for the trip back to the miser- 
able huts of Nestrond. 

Nona slapped a bowl of thin 
soup and a piece of stale bread 
down in front of him and called 
it lunch. He ate in silence and 
then went out behind the cabin 
to spend the afternoon digging 
the new cesspool. 

This made the work of the 
morning seem like a rest cure. 
The ground had been frozen 
since Nestrond first started to 
roll around its inadequate sun. 
By evening, his back and legs 
and thighs ached tormentingly. 
With only a foot of ground ex- 
cavated, he had to give up when 
night fell and staggered back 
toward the cabin with only one 
thought in mind . sleep. 



nphe howl that wrenched him 
from his first troubled 

slumber seemed to come from 
the deepest pits of hell. 

“Wha . what’s that?” he 
asked. 

“Ice wolves, you fool!” Nona 
screeched. “They’re after the 

cattleshed! Get out there and 

stop them!” 

Dandor staggered to his feet 
and fumbled for his clothes as 
another howl rent the night. He 
reached for his laser rifle while 
Nona yelled again. “Hurry up! 
Those things can rip logs off a 
shed like it was kindlin’.” 

He was out the door then 

with flashlight in one hand and 
rifle in the other. He saw them 
at once. There were two of the 
six-legged terrors. One of them 
was raised up on its four bact- 
legs, its massive jaws ripping at 
the timber of the shed. Dandor 
could hear the terrified bellow 
of the cattle inside. 

He ploughed through the snow 
toward the creature. It heard 
him and turned fiery red eyes 
in his direction. It kept on slash- 
ing at the logs for a second and 
then whirled and came at him 
in great leaping bounds. 

Caught by surprise, he had no 
time to drop the flashlight and 
lift the laser rifle to fringe posi- 
tion. He had to fire from the 
hip and the beam caught the 
monster in the shoulder. 



IN THE IMAGICON 



143 



It wasn’t good enough. He 
sidestepped as the huge body 
hurtled past him and then blast- 
ed its head off. Then he almost 
died himself as the decapitated 
thing went slithering through 
the snow, spurting blood every- 
where. He almost died because 
for a split second he had for- 
gotten its mate. 

He remembered only when the 
creature struck him from behind 
and sent him sprawling on the 
frozen ground. The monstrous 
beast was on top of him and he 
screamed as a claw ripped flesh 
away from his thigh and the 
powerful jaws moved toward his 
throat. 

The flashlight had been flung 
from his hand but the real 
rifle was still resting in its sling 
attached to his shoulder. He 
found the trigger and fired at 
full power. The laser beam tore 
off a leg and haunch of the ice 
wolf, and it fell away from him 
as he blasted it again. Then 
blackness closed in over him. 

When he came to, he was 
lying on the table in the cabin. 
Nona and a strange man were 
bending over him. 

“Well, you got yourself in a 
pretty mess this time!” Nona 
said as his eyes opened. 

“That leg is going to have to 
come off,” the stranger said. 

“Are you a doctor?” Dandor 
asked in a husky croak. 

144 



“Only one this side of Alpha 
Centaury,” the man said. 

“The pain . can’t you give 
me something for the pain?” 

“I gave you the last morphine 
I had. Back on Earth we might 
have saved that leg, but here — ” 
He made a helpless gesture. 

White-hot flame seemed to en- 
velop the slashed leg. Dandor 
winced and then saw the half 
smile on Nona’s lips as she said, 
“With no more morphine or 
anything else, cutting off that 
leg is gonna hurt like hell, ain’t 
it, Doc?” 

“I got some whiskey in my 
car,” the doctor said. “I’ll go get 
it.” 

T T e went hobbling off, and 
-*■ Nona leaned over Dandor 
and looked into his eyes. “It’s 
really gonna hurt, sweetie. It’s 
gonna hurt like it hurt me all 
those times when you went off 
and left me. When you went off 
in your black box.” 

“No, Nona, no! It didn’t hurt 
you. You’re not — ” He almost 
said she wasn’t capable of being 
hurt. But he stopped, because he 
didn’t know for sure if that were 
true. 

“With only one leg, you’re not 
gonna be able to get in that 
damn thing by yourself,” she 
said. “You’re gonna have to stay 
here and be nice to me.” 
“Nona!! No, you don’t under- 



GALAXY 



stand!” He started to plead with 
her, but then the doctor was 
back with a quart of whiskey 
and his black bag. 

“Here, drink this fast,” the 
man said, handing Dandor the 
bottle. 

He drank deeply and quickly. 
But it didn’t help much. 

As the doctor cut and sawed, 
Dandor was sure- his screams 
would burst his skull. At times 
he wondered why his curses 
didn’t snap the straps that held 
him down or drive off the two 
tormentors bending over him. 

“Well, I guess that’s it,” the 
doctor was saying when the 
agony dragged him up into con- 
sciousness again. “We’re gonna 
have to cauterize this stump or 
he’ll bleed to death. I ain’t got 
nuthin’ but fire to do it with 
either. Come help me heat up 
the poker, woman.” 

Dandor came fully awake as 
he caught the over-the-shoulder 
look Nona gave him and saw her 
eyes dart toward the Imagicon. 
It was almost as though she had 
said aloud, “You’ll belong to 
me now . only to me. There 
won’t be no more of that goin’ 
off.” 

But she couldn’t! How could 
she? Through the haze of mor- 
phine, alcohol and pain, Dandor 
tried to ask himself . why 
should she treat him this way? 
He couldn’t think of any answer. 



And as they hurried off to 
prepare the cauterizing iron for 
the bloody stump of his leg, the 
black coffin-like shape of the 
Imagicon filled his eyes and his 
mind. 

If the pain hadn’t already 
been more than reason could 
bear, he wouldn’t have had the 
courage to roll off the table and 
begin crawling toward the black 
box, leaving a trail of blood 
behind him. The black box 
Somehow he knew it representer’ 
a surcease from pain, a promise 
of ultimate safety. 

He reached it without their 
being aware of his actions, and 
by making a supreme effort, he 
pulled himself up high enough 
to press his palm against the 
sensor that identified him in- 
stantly and was the only thing 
in this or any other universe that 
could open it. 

He collapsed, more dead than 
alive, into the Imagicon and it 
closed silently over him. 

Then there was a bright, warm 
world around him, and bright 
young faces above him. 

t</"vh, Dandor, darling! Dar- 
ling,” Cecily cried, put 
ting her soft, warm arms around 
him. 

“Sweetheart, you’ve come 
back!” Daphne whispered. 

“We’re so happy to see yen"' 
the redheaded Terri murmured 



IN THE IMAGICON 



145 



“We’re so happy to see you!” 
her twin, Jerri, repeated. 

“And I’m the happiest of all!” 
Dandor assured them, gazing 
down at his leg. at his per- 
fectly whole, intact leg which 
felt no pain whatever. “Thank 
God! Thank God, I’m back!” 
The Imagicon had worked! It 
had worked once again! It had 
taken him to the world of imagi- 
nation and back again to reali- 
ty ... to wonderful, wonderful 
reality! 




WHY are they 
talking about me? 



Because America is no longer 
ashamed to talk about me and 
other children with birth de- 
fects. And America is doing 
something to stop birth de- 
fects through March of Dimes 
treatment and research. 

FIGHT BIRTH DEFECTS 
MARCH OF DIMES 

14 6 



Dandor sat up and looked 
around at his own warm, mar- 
velous world. It was the world 
of Earth in 22300, the world a 
hundred years after The Plague, 
the Plague which had attacked 
the male genes and reduced the 
male population to a few thou- 
sand and made each man the 
center of an eager and worship- 
ful harem of women. 

Many of the surviving men 
had not been able to stand the 
strain. Too many years of adora- 
tion, too many years of having 
everything and every woman 
they wanted had proved too 
much for them. 

Then there had come the 
Imagicon, the invention that 
made any world a man desired 
seem absolutely real. Some men 
had used it to create even more 
exotic and wonderful worlds 
than the one they lived in, but 
that had been only more of a 
good thing and had made them 
more dissatisfied than ever. 

Daf.dor had been wise. With 
his Imagicon, he had created an 
entirely different kind of world 
... a world of cold and terror 
called Nestrond. Dandor had 
known a great truth. 

What good was paradise with- 
out something to compare it to? 
Without a taste of hell from 
time to time, how could a man 
appreciate heaven?

MULLIGAN, GOME HOME! 

by ALLEN KIM LANG 



Everybody knows Mulligan. He's 
the fellow that turned the Solar 
System upside down and shook itl 



4 C/^vurs is essentially a tragic 
age,” the Chief said, pol- 
ishing his Dunhill pipe against 
tile side of his Roman nose; “so 
we refuse to take it tragically.” 

“Very well put, sir,” I ventured 
to comment. 

“But this man,” he went on, 
tapping with his pipe-stem the 
3-D xograph of Mulligan Mon- 
drian on his desk, “refuses to 
take our age even seriously. Be- 
cause of his jeux d’esprit, Thai 
rice-production is off thirty 
per cent. Coffee is twelve dollars 
a pound. We’ve had stiff notes 
from Canada, Korea and the 
USSR. Albania is rattling her 
midget sword in the halls of the 
UN, egged on by one of Mon- 
drian’s monstrous jests. What 
will he do next? We cannot wait 
to see. Find the man, Him- 
mel; and I’ll get you a GS-12. 
Fail, and I’ll guarantee you 



steady work weeding lawns for 
the Sahara Reclamation Author- 
ity.” 

“Sir!” I said. I double-timed 
out to the waiting jet. 

Twenty minutes later, I was 
unfolding my credentials in the 
office of a Terre Haute high 
school. “Felix Himmel, special 
agent of the Federation of Fed- 
eral Investigative Agencies, Bu- 
reaus, and Committees,” I an- 
nounced to the brunette, richly 
curved school secretary. “Tell 
me all you know about Mulligan 
Mondrian, class of ’99.” 

“I danced with Sweet Mulli- 
gan at the junior prom, the 
happiest night of my life,” she 
said. She closed her eyes and 
hummed a snatch of Moonrust. 
I patted her cheek to recall her 
to the present. “Mulligan had 
class,” she said. “He rode to 
school in a Rolls Royce Silver 



147 



Wraith phaeton. His chauffeur 
wore steel-gray gauntlets and 
called Mulligan mein Herr. 
Once he let me sit at his table 
in the school cafeteria. We had 
a sturdy little Burgundy with 
our sloppy joes.” She sighed and 
slipped a folder under my arm. 
“His records, Felix.” 

“Business first, my small,” I 
murmured, peeling her importu- 
nate fingers from the back of 
my neck. I flipped through the 
file. “H’m, what’s this?” Signed 
by the teacher who’d served as 
head of the English Department 
and third-assistant basketball 
coach (Defense) during my sub- 
ject’s high school career, it was 
a memo reporting: “Mulligan 

has got the Athalete’s Foot.” 
Some sleuth’s-instinct led me to 
slip this bit of paper into my 
pocket. “Later, sweetness,” I 
said, freeing myself, unlocking 
the door, and closing it firmly 
behind me. I made down the 
hall to interview the incumbent 
of the Mulligan Mondrian Me- 
morial Chair of Classical San- 
skrit. 

Swami Jairamdas T. Chattop- 
adhyaya, though having no En- 
glish, did speak Malayalam, 
which I’d had drummed into 
my head during that mess on 
the Malabar Coast. Swamiji, 
characteristically inverted in the 
Rirshasana posture, explained 
that his department had been 



endowed as Mondrian’s parting 
gift to his high school; and that 
the presentation had been made 
with the stipulation (unique, so 
far as I know, in Hoosier sec- 
ondary education) that each 
future student, as prerequisite to 
graduation, maintain satisfacto- 
ry grades during the four-year 
course. Chatt’s only hint as to 
Mondrian’s present whereabouts 
was a terse, “Look to the stars.” 

nphe department plane took 
■*- me next to Monte Carlo, 
where I spoke with the now- 
retired teacher who’d served as 
Dean of Boys during the Mon- 
drian years at Central High. 

I learned a bit more about 
Sweet Mulligan’s Bunny-Herd, 
that corps of sketchily attired 
drum majorettes who had at- 
tended the lad in study hall and 
at basketball games. Nothing 
more. “I should enjoy helping 
you Federal fellows find Mon- 
drian,” my host testified, enrich- 
ing my tulip-glass yet again with 
his exquisite brandy. He frown- 
ed as a shadow passed over the 
patio. “You must find him,” he 
said. “But all I can tell you, 
Mr. Himmel, is that hunting 
after white whales was always 
Mondrian’s chief sport. When 
you catch up with him, I wager 
he’ll be holding his harpoon 
poised to puncture something 
pale, fat and smug. Why don’t

you inquire at the University? 
It was always one of his favor- 
ite fishing-grounds.” 

• Plump and pale, but no longer 
proud was the night custodian 
of the student lounge at Indiana 
University’s Department of Xen- 
ology, in the School of Overskies 
Studies. Once splendid in ten- 
ure, lately President of the Big 
Ten University, the custodian 
now wore Iron Man overalls and 
chewed Brown’s Mule as he re- 
lated to me the Scandal of Dou- 
ble-oh-naught. 

“Eldritch, Mr. Himmel, how 
that gentle-talkin’ broth of a 
lad warmed his way into our 
hearts; only to destroy ’s.” Mon- 
drian’s researches in Martian 
philology were from the first so 
insightful (“though it’s been 
proved his best translations were 
cribs from the works of Elbert 
Hubbard”) that his professors 
eagerly accepted the boy’s offer 
to take on the task of reading 
proof for The Loose-Leaf En- 
chiridion of Demotic and Hier- 
atic Martian Epigraphy, a pres- 
tige journal in its field. Under 
the proofreadership of Mulligan 
Mondrian, the Enchiridion, 
originally a biennial, began ap- 
pearing daily; and with both a 
morning and an evening edition. 
The subscription - list, eleven 
names when the brilliant fresh- 
man entered upon his work,

lion copies before the unfortu- 
nate President of the University, 
casually leafing through a cur- 
rent issue, discovered to his hor- 
ror (“my each particular hair 
stood on end like quills upon 
the fretful porpentine; and you 
better believe it!”) that proof- 
reader Mondrian had tunneled 
into Jordan Hall, home of the 
Kinsey Institute, to secure enter- 
taining copy. 

The young journalist had run. 
as serials, the confidential sex- 
diaries of three dozen historical 
figures, living and dead; and 
had illustrated them with four- 
color selections from the porno- 
graphic art of five continents 
and three planets. Despite an 
amicus-brief arguing that the 
youngster’s limerick - sequence. 
Mars is a Four -Letter Word, 
represented a giant step forward 
in epigraphic exegesis. Mondri 
an got the brush, the President 
his broom. 

II forking on the clue that my 
’ ’ subject preferred a scarce 
Canadian whiskey, I picked un 
his trail in Ottawa. My plants 
in the Ministry of External Af- 
fairs could not (or would not) 
reveal how Mondrian obtained 
Canadian citizenship, nor why 
Parliament commissioned the 
callow youth to carry on eth- 
nographic surveys in the far 
north.

“Muktuk Mulligan," as he was 
dubbed by his adoring, all-girl 
scientific team, headed into the 
permafrost country so late in 
the year that seasoned arcticists 
warned that he’d be caught by 
the first blizzards. 

As indeed he was. Mondrian 
and his staff were forced to 
huddle together through the win- 
ter in a trapper’s hut on Vic- 
toria Island. (Floor plans of the 
hut have recently appeared in 
a popular publication. The read- 
er is directed to “Playboy’s 
High-Latitude Hideaway,” Ptay- 
boy, vol. 49, no. 3; March ’02.) 

The explorers’ return, none 
the worse for their privations, 
amazed the scientific world, as 
did Mondrian’s announcement 
of his discovery of a race of 
Spanish -speaking Eskimos in- 
habiting a previously uncharted 
island in Viscount Melville 
Sound. By the time the chilled 
“Eskimos” (a busload of Texi- 
can migrant agricultural work- 
ers recruited from Michigan to- 
mato-fields on the pretext they’d 
be paid 35c a peck for gathering 
reindeer moss) had been rescued 
from their “island” (a Dow Sty- 
rofoam raft constructed by Mon- 
drian for the purpose of his 
hoax), the adventurer had sold 
his memoirs to half a dozen 
newspapers, including the New 
York Times (“Northern Com- 
munity Preserves Tradition of 



Cervantes, de Vega”), Pravda 
(“Refugees from Falangist Re- 
vanchism Battle Snow, Ice”), 
and The National Insider (“Hot- 
Blooded Northmen Sleep Raw.) 

The Republican Canadian 
Mounted Police traced Mondri- 
an to Hong Kong, where they 
lost their man. Drawing upon 
the ABC’s Secret Fund, I pur- 
chased a suggestion that Hong 
Kong is convenient to Seoul, 
where a year ago there had 
rested on the lawn before the 
Presidential Palace a pearl of 
great price. 

Built by Krupp of Essen for 
Korea’s inchoate force de frap- 
pe, the spaceship Prince of 
Heaven was the first of the 
bubbleships, a vessel that com- 
manded the power of a force- 
field to float it, a steel- and - 
vacuum balloon, up through the 
expensive first three hundred 
miles of the gravity-well to a 
launching-pad within the sub- 
urbs of space. 

M. Jules d’Harnoncourt Pak. 
Commissioner of the Surete Na

furnishings dating from the ear- 
liest Silla Dynasty. This was 
dizzy stuff to our legislators, 
who had just been introduced 
to La Gloire; and who had 
thereupon passed a law making 
compulsory the teaching of our 
history as Nation Number One, 
beginning : 

“Hwanung, son of the Creator, 
visited a Korean pine-forest in 
2333 B.C., from which date our 
years are yet reckoned. The dis- 
tinguished tourist there sur- 
prised a lovely virgin, just trans- 
formed from hairy beardom to 
smooth womanhood. Hwanung 
breathed upon the girl, conceiv- 
ing by his respiratory art Tang- 
’un, born some fifteen minutes 
later as the first King of Korea. 
Officially. 

“Well, now,” Commissioner 
Pak continued. “This bewhisker- 
ed youth, whom I most sincerely 
believe to have been camel- 
spawn Mulligan Mondrian, rep- 
resented that he required our 
spaceship (everybody’s income- 
tax for the next ten years) to 
explore Heaven more complete- 
ly, there to search out the starry 
homeland of the founder of our 
Hermit Kingdom. 

“So we gave him our SS Prince 
of Heaven, cheering wildly and 
singing our Chant National, a 
song with the same tune, and on 
this occasion much the same 
spirit, as the Auld Lang Syne

caroled by inebriated Western 
boulevardiers on 31 December. 

“Mulligan Mondrian had ap- 
pointed as his co-emissary to 
the gods the teen-aged and nu- 
bile daughter of our President.” 
M. Pak sighed. “No bear, she. 
Although from the manner in 
which Mondrian breathed upon 
her I should not be entirely 
amazed were she to give birth 
in season to a new King of Con. 
Be that as it may, our visitor 
and his tender lieutenant rose 
skyward, followed by our agnos- 
tic prayers. More kimchi, Him- 
mel-Sonsang?” 

Regretting my first, I declined 
a second serving of this Korean 
piece de resistance, a sort of 
sauerkraut blended with soy- 
sauce and lent authority by ma- 
ture fish. I was flying to the 
moon, and had been warned to 
prepare for the journey by in- 
gesting a low-residue diet. 

Moonside, I munched Turns 
and drove by rented crawler to 
Eratosthenes Station in the south 
Aprennines. It was there, on 
pretext of searching for traces 
of the moon-insect swarms de- 
scribed by W.H. Pickering in 
1924, that Mondrian mined ice 
from a fossil glacier, purchased 
calcium carbide from a Chinese 
sourdough working the Marco 
Polo quarries and with the help 
of his Korean girl-friend blend- 
ed the two to produce acetylene 

151 



gas, which he hydrated and hy- 
drogenated to manufacture a 
very fair grade of ethyl alcohol. 
(The curious reader is invited 
to use the margin of the page 
to work out the equations of 
this amusing reaction, not for- 
getting to utilize finely-divided 
nickel as catalyst.) Mondrain 
watered down the juice from his 
chemical plant for sale to the 
Russian station at Copernicus 
as Smirnoff Vodka, accepting in 
payment Soviet diamonds from 
the pipes of Mount Dyson. 

Just before his moonshine 
plant was raided by the Lunar 
Authority’s Revenue Agents, 
Mondrian escaped, leaving be- 
hind the Korean President’s 
daughter and taking with him 
both his ill-gotten diamonds and 
the Soviet scientific team’s jun- 
ior selenologist, Sonia Nebitska- 
ya Suslik, whom he had won at 
blackjack. 

A s footnote, it will be re- 
membered that the Lunar 
Authority’s men claim to have 
discovered in Mondrian’s aban- 
doned bubblehut more than a 
thousand living individuals of a 
mantis-like creature, each the 
length of a man’s hand, each 
having eight twelve-jointed legs 
and four rudimentary wings. 

When the agents burst into 
the bubblehut, according to their 
subsequent report, these lunar 

152 



arthropods attempted to com- 
municate by scratching elabor- 
ate geometrical designs in the 
dust of the furniture. These 
were, needless to say, the con- 
troversial Mondrian Mantes. No 
specimen of this insect has yet 
been examined by a trustworthy 
xenologist, inasmuch as in his 
amazement Captain (now Pri- 
vate) Finnian Fenn had left 
Mondrian’s airlock wide open. 
Abandoning their efforts at 
graphic communion, the entire 
company of mantes hopped off 
to disappear in the shadows of 
the Sinus Aestuum (“Bay of 
Summer”), singing in telepathic 
chorus. “It was very like,” Pvt. 
Fenn told me, “a marching-band 
of tiny glockenspiels.” 

Their ship stocked with fro- 
zen dinners and foul-weather 
gear, Mulligan Mondrian and 
Miss Sonia Nebitskaya Suslik 
set out for Pluto, counting on 
the superiority of their Korean 
vessel to win them a planetfall 
never before achieved. 

Captain Mondrian’s first cis- 
Martian task was to re-christen 
his stolen vessel the Star Ship 
Kalman, painting on her bow 
the name of his personal hero, 
that 12th-century foe of censor- 
ship and King of Hungary, Kal- 
man the Book-Lover. 

Why did Mondrian undertake 
so arduous a journey? 

I asked just this question of 

GALAXY 



Miss Suslik, whom I met in the 
Virgo Room of the Constellation 
Club, in Atlantic City. “Chust 
for laughs,” Miss Suslik suggest- 
ed. She recalled that Mondrian 
had with him an enormous ban- 
ner of the Peoples’ Republic of 
Albania, which he would often 
wave about his head in the ship’s 
lounge, shouting ribald, pseudo- 
Stalinist slogans; and that he 
had among his papers a pass- 
port issued by that most Pluton- 
ian of nations. My guess is that 
he amused himself by picturing 
the discomfiture of those U.S. 
and Soviet astronauts who would 
someday reach the farthest is- 
land of our solar sea only to 
find the double-headed eagle of 
their pipsqueak adversary al- 
ready in possession. 

As to the tedium of the trip, 
“We were nod,” Miss Suslik re- 
ported to me, blushing prettily 
across her Pavlov Fizz, “always 
wavink flags.” 

Somewhere beyond the orbit 
of Neptune, the SS Kalman re- 
ceived a Mayday call in standard 
Morse. Surprised to hear En- 
glish spoken (so to speak) so 
far from home, the Kalman’s 
skipper radared in on the signal. 

'-p'he ship that appeared on 
his viewscreens was, to em- 
ploy Mondrian’s meiosis, anoth- 
er breed of cat. 

The paradox of an extrasolar 

MULLIGAN, COME HOME! 



beings having recourse to an 
Earthly call for help was ex- 
plained when Mondrian visited 
the alien ship. Its sole passenger, 
whom we now refer to as the 
Brunswick Creature, had just 
left our planet; and had come 
down with one of those tourista 
complaints that so often vex the 
delicate traveler. 

Mondrian consoled the Bruns- 
wick Creature as best he could, 
then returned to the Kalman to 
get a can of white powder from 
the medicine cabinet in ship’s 
head. He allowed Miss Suslik to 
accompany him back to the 
Creature’s vessel, it being locked 
to the Kalman by an access-tub. 

The testimony that follows is 
transcribed from a tape-record- 
ing of Miss Suslik’s debriefing, 
held at the Virgo Room, Atlantic 
City, where the junior selenolo- 
gist was abandoned by her whi- 
lom protector. It may be helpful 
to hold in mind the fact that 
the Russian girl was blonde, 
blue-eyed and contoured a per- 
fect 97-61-91; that her tongue 
struck English consonants with 
the sweetness of a lovingly 
plucked, far-off balalaika; and 
that the girl had three advanced 
degrees in xenography and four 
double Pavlovs at the time of 
our interview. I quote the tape: 

HI MM EL : “Please describe, 
Miss Suslik, the physical ap- 
pearance of the Creature.” 

153 



SUSLIK: “You got this game, 
Mr. Himmel, I have seen on the 
Tay Bay, where people hurl 
globes at standink-on-their-ends 
clubs? Okay? Da. Bowlink. So. 
Such a ball, so big ...” 

HIMMEL : “Let the record re- 
flect that Respondent standing 
(very prettily) on tiptoe, holds 
her right hand approximately 
three meters from the carpet.” 
SUSLIK : “Had in globe slot, 
like for fingers? Outside of 
Creature all shiny black. Slot 
all fuzzy white. Creature talked 
Russian and English, creaky 
squeaky, like had sore t’roat. 
Voice from out of slot. Had 
learned from Chicago. Had vis- 
ited. Had watched ’round. Also 
in Minsk.” 

HIMMEL: “Did you, Sonia 
Nebitskay, ascertain what man- 
ner of information this surrep- 
titious surveillance was designed 
to adduce?” 

(Translation difficulty re- 
solved as) : 

HIMMEL: “Why he snoop?” 
SUSLIK : “Creature is travel- 
writer and professional greedy.” 
(Translation difficulty resolved 
as) : 

SUSLIK: “...gourmet.” 

HPhe next several responses 
-*■ consist largely of semantic 
quibbles between myself, darling 
Sonia and the bartender of the 
Constellation Club. In precis: 



The Brunswick Creature is 
hermaphroditic (or, as Mondri- 
an said, “AC/DC, with portable 
power”). It utilizes its single 
orifice, or omnipore, for inges- 
tion of food and drink, for ex- 
cretion, for reproduction (“they 
extrude, secrete and exult,” 
Sonia Nebitskaya explained, 
“but only in private”), for sens- 
ing the environment with a 
battery of transducers (rather 
like a photocopy machine, the 
Creature sees only items it en- 
gulfs, its omnipore being studded 
with eyes and coated with a 
luminescent membrane) and for 
sound-production. This settled, 
back to the tape. 

HIMMEL: “ ... nother couple 
o’ drinks. How, Sonia sweet, 
did your companion propose to 
assist the creature?” 

SUSLIK: “Sweet Mulligan, he 
crawl into Creature’s mouth-etc. 
With flashlight, he look around 
inside. He call me to hand in 
can of white powder. I hand in 
can of white powder. Mulligan 
sift white powder around inside 
Creature, like salting giant clam. 
Comes out.” 

HIMMEL : “Did Mulligan 

Mondrian, who after all had 
studied xenology at the prestigi- 
ous School of Overskies Studies, 
have any explanation of the 
Brunswick Creature’s distress?” 

SUSLIK: “Sweet Mulligan, he 
tell Creature, ‘Man, you got

worst case Athlete’s Foot of the 
Orifice I ever seen.’ Creature 
then explain how he got exposed. 
Outside Japanese tea-house, he 
sees line of shoes, look like suc- 
culent lizards of his native land. 
Hungry, tired of biscuits and 
Spam, he eats shoes. ‘Stringy,’ 
he writes in notebook. ‘No star 
for Japanese inn.’ Then, one 
day later, is Creature sick. Can- 
not see, excrete, extrude, exult 
or talk plain.” 

HIM MEL: “ and this can 
of white powder that Mondrian 
scattered inside the Brunswick 
Creature?” 

SUSLIK “ ... is Dr. Scholl’s 
for Athlete’s Foot. Sweet Mulli- 
gan has same trouble, but ( snick- 
er ) wit’ him, does not interfere 
wit’ extrudink, exultink, secret- 
ink, etc.” 

HIMMEL: “Steppe-blossom, 

was Mondrian’s medication ef- 
fective?” 

SUSLIK: “In one day, was 
Creature all good again! And so 
happy! He say, Anyt’ing you 
Wan’, Baby, iss yours!" 

HIMMEL: “How did Mondri- 
an reply to the Creature’s offer 
of carte blanche?” 

SUSLIK: “To offer of white 
card, Sweet Mulligan reply, T 
got good healt’, dirty mind and 
good - lookink woman. What 
more could ex-Eagle -Scout esk? 
My momma, she said I wouldn’t 
be satisfied wit’out little green 



fence around the world; but I’m 
pretty heppy now, t’ank you 
very much. Here, if you want 
to do somet’ink for me, Creature- 
fella, maybe you stop, say “Hel- 
lo” next time you’re in Solar 
System.’ And Sweet Mulligan 
write his name and ZIP-code on 
card, which he insert in Bruns- 
wick Creature.” 

HIMMEL (rather over- 
wrought) : “Did you see that 
card, Miss Suslik? Do you know 
Mulligan Mondrian’s present 
whereabouts?” 

SUSLIK (tearfully) : “If I 

know where iss Sweet Mulligan, 
you t’ink I be sitting in stinkink 
Atlantic City wit’, no offense, 
capitalist jackal?” 

HIMMEL: “Oh. Did Creature 
reply to Mondrian?” 

SUSLIK : “Creature replied. 

‘Here is to get me,’ he say; and 
give Sweet Mulligan small box 
with toggle-switch, designed for 
being operated inside orifice 
but okay with fingers in a pinch. 
‘Give me a ring any time, Doc,’ 
Brunswick Creature say; and 
then ‘Good-by;’ and we go back 
to SS Kalman and to Pluto and 
Atlantic City, in that order. And 
when I come out after powder- 
ink my nose, he iss gone.” 
Thus far the record. 

I’ve failed to get hold of either 
Mulligan Mondrian or that tog- 
gle-box wherewith the Bruns- 
wick Creature can be talked to.

y^\nce, many years before (it 
was actually several centur- 
ies, counting the deep-freeze 
time), little Chuck Forrester had 
caused a three-car auto smash 
that put two people in the hos- 
pital. 

He had done it with his little 
slingshot, lying out in the tall 



grass next to his house in Amity- 
ville, taking shots at the cars on 
the highway. His aim was too 
good. He hit one. He got a state 
policeman in the eye. The cop 
had lost control, jumped into the 
opposite lane, sideswiped a con- 
vertible and skidded into a sta- 
tion wagon. 

Nobody died; the policeman 
didn’t even lose his eye, though it 



157 



WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE— 



Hfe name was Forrester, and he had been burned to death. 

But not permanently ... for the medical science of six centuries of progress had 
learned how to freeze a man at the instant of dying, hold him in the slow, dreamless 
calm of the liquid helium chambers . and bring him back to life with all his mortal 
wounds healed and his body as strong and healthy as it had ever been. He might die 
again — but the same science that had brought him back to life could do it again, 
and again. 

He was, in fact, immortal. And so was all the world. Brave world! thought Forrester, 
amazed and delighted, and set out to enjoy his new life; and within hours of waking 
up, on his first day in the new life, he was killed again. 

Why? It had been senseless — an unprovoked beating. He was put back together 
again and turned loose; but he was out of money, and needed a job; and the fine new 
world no longer looked so fine. 

But Forrester had friends to help him — a girl, Adne; her two children; a few others. 
They showed him how to apply for a job; he did; he got it — and discovered that 
his new employer was an alien from a planet of the star Sirius, sworn enemy of 
everything on Earth! 

He lost the job and lost his money, and found himself with the poor unfortunates 
of the 26th Century called "The Forgotten Men". The one friend he made there was 
brutally kiiid before his eyes. Then the Sirian he had worked for found him, and tricked 
him into making it possible for the Sirian to escape Earth — presumably to gather a war 
fleet to begin Earth's invasion! 



was close for a while; and as it 
happened they didn’t think to 
look around the neighborhood 
for kids with slingshots. The ac- 
cident went down on the books 
as due to a pebble thrown up by 
a passing car. But Chuck didn’t 
know that. For a solid year af- 
terward he woke up in a sweat 
of fear every night, and all his 
days were horrors of anticipat- 
ing being caught. 

It was just so now. 



It was perfectly clear to Forr- 
ester that he was the one who 
had helped the Sirian circumvent 
the electronic defenses that kept 
the aliens bound to Earth. He 
could work it out step by step 
in his mind. The Sirian had 
shopped around until it found a 
human being ignorant enough, 
and pliable enough, to be un- 
suspicious. It had contrived to 
program him to fly it to the site 
of an obsolete, but still work-

able, spaceship. The Sirian had 
been unconscious, or in whatever 
state in a Sirian passed for un- 
conscious, so that the electronic 
alarms would register nothing. 
It had commanded him to load it 
aboard the ship and launch it 
into space. 

And he had done as he was 
commanded, in the fuzzy-minded 
suggestibility it had doped him 
into. 

Perfectly clear! He could see 
every step. And if he could, cer- 
tainly others could. All they had 
to do was take the trouble to 
think it through, and certainly 
all the world was thinking hard 
about the Sirians. The view-all 
was full of news: special investi- 
gating teams ransacking the site 
of the take-off for clues, a hun- 
dred new probes launched to 
guard the perimeter of the Solar 
System. Condition Yellow alert 
declared and everyone cautioned 
to remain within easy distance of 
a raid shelter at all times. 

Forrester kept waiting for the 
hand to fall on his shoulder and 
the voice to cry: “You, Forres- 
ter! You are the man!” 

But it did not come. 

1\ j% eanwhile, the flap over the 
escape of Sirian Four had 
had one good effect, and that 
was that Adne was so interested 
in the excitement that she became 
friendly to Forrester again. She 



even fed him, let him clean him- 
self up in her bath and, as the 
children were off on some emer- 
gency drill with their age-peers, 
gave him their room to sleep in 
when it became obvious he was 
near collapse. 

Voices woke him — Adne’s and 
a man’s. 

“ — mostly for the kids, of 
course. I’m not so worried for 
myself.” 

“Natch, honey. God! At a time 
like this! Just when the So- 
ciety’s ready to swing.” 

“It wouldn’t be so bad, but it 
makes you wonder about a lot 
of other things. I mean, really, 
how could they let that thing 
escape?” 

A masculine growl: “Hah! 

How? Haven’t I been telling you 
how? It’s letting machines do 
men’s work! We’ve put our desti- 
ny in the hands of solid-state 
components, so what do you ex- 
pect? Don’t you remember my 
White Paper last year? I said, 
‘Guarding men’s liberties is a post 
of honor and only the honored 
should hold it.’ ” 

Forrester sat up, recognizing 
the voice: Taiko Hironibi. The 
Luddite. 

“I thought you were talking 
about the coppers,” said Adne’s 
voice . 

“Same thing! Machines should 
do machine work, men should do 
men’s — hey, what’s that?” 



160 



GALAXY 



Forrester realized he had made 
a noise. He stood up, feeling 
ancient and worn, but some- 
what better than before he slept, 
and was coming out toward them 
even before Adne answered Tai- 
ko. “It’s only Charles. Come in 
here, Charles, why don’t you?” 

Taiko was standing before the 
view- wall, joymaker in his hand. 
His thumb was on one of the 
studs, and apparently he had just 
been giving himself a shot of 
one brand or another of euphoria. 
Even so, he glowered at Forres- 
ter. 

“Oh, don’t be like that,” said 
Adne. 

“Huh,” said Taiko. 

“If I can forgive him, you can 
forgive him. You have to make 
allowances for the kamikaze 
ages.” 

“Hah,” said Taiko. But the 
euphoria prevailed — either that 
from the joymaker, or the spice 
of danger that was sweeping 
them all. Taiko clipped the joy- 
maker to his belt, rubbed his 
chin, then grinned. “Well, why 
not? All us human beings have 
to stand together now, right? Put 
’er there.” 

Gravely they shook hands. 
Forrester felt altogether ridicu- 
lous doing it; he was not sure 
what he had done to offend Tai- 
ko in the first place, he was not 
particularly anxious to be for- 
given by him now. Although, he 



reminded himself, Taiko had 
once offered him a job, and a 
job was something he needed. 
Though with the Sirian threat so 
urgent and imminent now it was 
at least an open question whether 
the Ned'Lud Society would need 
any more workers. 

It could not hurt to find out. 
Before he could change his mind, 
Forrester said rapidly: “I want 
you to know, Taiko, that I’ve 
been thinking a lot about what 
you said. You were right, of 
course.” 

Taiko’s eyes opened. “About 
what?” 

“About the danger of the ma- 
chines, I mean. What I think 
is, men should do men’s work 
and machines should do machine 
work.” 

“Yes?” 

“There’s only one computer 
you can trust.” Forrester tapped 
his skull with a forefinger. “The 
one up here.” 

“Sure, but — ” 

“It just bums me up.” said 
Forrester angrily, “to think that 
they left the safeguarding of 
our planet to solid-state com- 
ponents! If only they’d listened 
to you!” 

TX7"ith part of his attention For- 
* ’ rester could hear a smoth- 
ered giggle from Adne, but he 
ignored it. “I want you to know.” 
he cried, “that I’ve come to some 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



161 



conclusions over the last few 
days, and I’m for the Ned Lud 
Society a hundred per cent. Let 
me help, Taiko! Call on me for 
anything!” 

Taiko gave the girl a look of 
absent-minded puzzlement, then 
returned to Forrester. “Well,” he 
said, “I’m glad to hear that. I’ll 
keep that in mind, if anything 
comes up.” 

It took all of Forrester’s self- 
control to keep his expression 
friendly and eager; why was 
Taiko being so slow? But Adne 
rescued him. Suppressing her 
g : ggles, she said excitedly: “Say, 
Taiko! Why don’t you give 
Charles a job with the Society? 
I mean, if he’d be willing to take 
it.” 

Taiko frowned and hesitated, 
but Forrester didn’t give him a 
chance. “I’m willing,” he said 
nobly. “I meant what I said; 
glad to help.” 

Taiko shrugged after a second 
and said, “Well, fine, then, For- 
rester. Of course, the money’s 
not much — ” 

“Doesn’t matter a bit!” cried 
Forrester. “It’s what I want to 
do! Uh, how much?” 

“Well, basic scale is twenty- 
six thousand — ” 

“A day?” 

“Sure, Forrester.” 

“It doesn’t matter,” said For- 
rester largely. “I only want to 
serve any way I can.” And, ex- 



ultant, he allowed himself to be 
given a drink to celebrate, which 
he enlarged to be a meal, Adne 
tolerantly amused. 

And all the while the view-all 
was displaying scenes of alarm 
and panic unheeded. 

Forrester had not forgotten 
that he had betrayed the Earth 
to the Sirians, he had only sub- 
merged that large and unpleas- 
ant thought in the smaller, but 
more immediate, pleasure of hav- 
ing escaped from the Forgotten 
Men. He drank a warm, minty 
froth and ate nut-like little 
spheres that tasted like crisp 
pork; he accepted a spray of a 
pinkly evanescent cloud from 
Adne’s joymaker that made him 
feel about seventeen again — 
briefly. Tomorrow would be time 
enough to worry about what he 
had done to the world, he 
thought. For today it was enough 
to be eating well and to have 
a place in the scheme of man- 
kind. 

But all his worries came back 
to him when he heard his name 
spoken. It was Taiko’s joymaker 
that spoke it, and it said: “Man 
Hironibi! Permit an interrup- 
tion, please. Are you in the 
company of Man Forrester, 
Charles Dalgleish?” 

“Yes, sure,” said Taiko, a beat 
before Forrester opened his 
mouth to plead with him to 
deny it. 



162 



GALAXY 



“Will you ask Man Forrester 
to speak his name, Man Hiron- 
ibi?” 

“Go ahead, Forrester. It’s to 
identify you, see?” 

TT'orrester put down the cup of 
frothed mint and took a deep 
breath. This pink cloud of joy 
might as well never have been. 
He felt every year of his age, 
even the centuries in the freezer. 
He said, because he could 
think of no excuse for not saying 
it: “Oh, all right. Charles Dalg- 
leish Forrester. Is that what you 
want?” 

Promptly the joymaker said: 
“Thank you, Man Forrester. 
Your acoustic pattern is confirm- 
ed. Will you accept a message 
of fiscal change?” 

That was quick, thought For- 
rester, clutching at a feeling of 
relief; the thing only wanted to 
asknowledge his new job! “Sure.” 
“Man Forrester,” said Taiko’s 
joymaker, “your late employer, 
now permanently removed from 
this ecology, left instructions to 
disburse his entire residual es- 
tate as follows: to the League 
for Interspecial Amity, one mil- 
lion dollars; to the Shoggo Cen- 
tral Gilbert and Sullivan Guild, 
one million dollars; to the United 
Fraternity of Peace Clubs, five 
million dollars; the balance, 
amounting to ninety-one million 
seven hundred sixty- three thous- 



and one hundred forty-two dol- 
lars, estimated as of this mom- 
ent — mark — to be transferred 
to the account of his last em- 
ployee as of date of removal, 
to wit yourself. I am now so 
transferring this sum. Man For- 
rester. You may draw on it as 
you wish.” 

Forrester sank weakly back 
against the cushions of Adne’s 
bright, billowy couch. He could 
not think of anything to say. 

“God bless,” cried Adne, 
“you’re rich again, Charles! Why, 
you lucky creature!” 

“Sure are,” echoed Taiko, 
grasping his hand warmly. For- 
rester could only nod. 

But he was not really sure 
that he was so lucky as he seem- 
ed. Ninety-one million dollars! 
It was a lot of money, even in 
this age of large numbers! It 
would keep him in comfort for 
a long time, surely; it would 
finance all sorts of pleasures and 
pursuits; it would remove him 
from the whim of Taiko’s pleas- 
ure and insure him against a re- 
lapse to the Forgotten Men. But 
what would happen, Forrester 
thought painfully, when some- 
one asked, first, who that late 
employer happened to be — and 
why that employer, before re- 
turning to his native planet cir- 
cling around the star Sirius, had 
so lavishly rewarded Charles 
Forrester? 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT

<t'V7'ou look tired, Charles,” 
-*■ said Adne kindly. 

“Sweat, his wealth worries 
him,” said Taiko, grinning. 

“You ought to come with us 
and relax,” Adne nodded. 

“It’s everybody’s duty to keep 
fit — now more than ever,” Tai- 
ko urged. 

“You’re being very good to 
me,” Forrester said gratefully. 
But what he really wanted was 
to sit in that room and watch 
the view-wall. One by one the 
remote monitoring stations of 
Earth’s defense screen were re- 
porting in, and although the re- 
port from each one of them so 
far was the same — “No sign of 
the escaped Sirian” — Forrester 
wanted to stay with it, stay right 
in that room watching that view- 
wall, until there was some other 
report. To make sure that Earth 
was safe, of course. But also to 
find out, at the earliest possible 
moment, if the (hopefully) re- 
captured Sirian gave out any in- 
formation about his accom- 
plice. ... 

“Well, we’re going crawling,” 
said Adne. “And we really ought 
to take off right now.” 

Forrester said irritably, “Wait 
a minute, what did they just say 
about Groombridge 1830?” 

“They said what they’ve been 
saying for a week, dear Charles. 

164 



That thing they spotted is only 
a comet. Are we going to crawl 
or aren’t we?” 

Taiko said humorously, 
“Charles is still a little dazed 
with his new loot. But look, old 
buddy, some of us have got 
things to do.” 

Forrester took his eyes from 
the view-wall’s star map and 
looked at Taiko, who winked 
and added: “Now that you’re 
on the team, you ought to learn 
the ropes.” 

“Team?” said Forrester. 
“Ropes?” 

“I have to do a communica- 
tion for the Society,” Taiko ex- 
plained. “You know. What you 
used to call a widecast. And as 
you’re on the payroll now you 
ought to come along and see 
how it’s done, because frankly 
— ” he nudged Charles — “it 
won’t be too long before you’re 
doing them yourself.” 

“But first we crawl,” said 
Adne, “so shall we the sweat get 
going?" 

S o they hustled Forrester along, 
muttering and abstracted as 
he was, until he realized that he 
was attracting attention to him- 
self. He stopped, because he 
didn’t want to do that. 

It might be, thought Forrester, 
that the right and proper thing 
for him to do was to go to some- 
one in authority — if he ever 



GALAXY 



found anyone in authority in this 
work!, except maybe the joy- 
maker — and say, frankly and 
openly, “Look, sir. I seem to 
have done something wrong and 
I wish to make a statement 
about it. Under what I guess 
was hypnosis I made it possible 
for that Sirian to escape, thus 
blowing the whole security of 
the human race forever.” Con- 
fess the whole thing, and take 
his medicine. 

Yes, he thought, some time I 
probably had better do just that. 
But not right now. 

Meanwhile he tried to look 
as much like everybody else as 
he possibly could, and if this re- 
quired him to be thrilled but 
casual about the danger of an 
invasion fleet of Sirians appear- 
ing in the sky at any moment to 
crush Earth, then he would do 
his best to seem thrilled but 
casual. 

“Well,” he cried gaily, “we 
sure had a good run for our 
money! Best little old masters 
of the planet I ever saw! But 
may the best race win, right?” 

Adne looked at him, then at 
Taiko, who shrugged and said, 
"I guess he’s still a little shook.” 

Dampened, Forrester concen- 
trated on observing what was 
going on around him. Taiko and 
the girl were bringing him to 
a part of Shoggo he had not 
previously visited, south along 



the shore to what looked like 
a left-over World’s Fair. Their 
cab landed and let them out in 
a midway bustling with groups 
and couples in holiday mood, 
surrounded by buildings with a 
queer playtime flavor. Nor was 
the flavor confined to the build 
ings. The place was a carnival 
of joy and what Forrester at 
once recognized as concupiscence. 
The aphrodisiac spray that in- 
dividual joymakers dispensed in 
microgram jolts was here a mist 
hanging in the air. The booths 
and displays were shocking to 
Forrester, at first, until he had 
a few deep breaths of the tonic, 
the invigorating air. Then he 
began at last to enjoy himself. 

“That’s better,” cried Adne, 
patting him. “Down this way, 
past the Joy Machine!" 

Forrester followed along, ob- 
serving his surroundings with in- 
creasing relaxation and pleasure. 
The place was a horticultural 
triumph as well as everything 
else. Flowers and grasses grew 
out of the ground he walked 
on and the margins at his sides; 
out of elevated beds that leaned 
out to the midway with emerald 
grapes and bright red luminous 
berries; out of geometrical plant- 
ings that hung on the sides of 
the buildings. Even on the walk 
itself, among the happy hum- 
ans, there were what looked like 
shrubs bearing clusters of peach 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



165 



and orange-colored fruits — but 
they moved. They stumped 
clumsily and slowly about on 
rootlike legs. 

“In here,” said Adne, clutch- 
ing at his arm. 

“Hurry up!” cried Taiko, 
shoving him. 

They entered a building like 
a fort, and went down a ramp 
surrounded by twinkling pat- 
terns of light. The concentra- 
tion of joymaker spray was a 
dozen times stronger here than 
in the open air. Forrester be- 
gan to feel lightheaded, and 
to look at Adne with more in- 
terest than he would have be- 
lieved that day would allow him 
in anything but Sirians. Adne 
leaned close to nibble his ear; 
Taiko laughed in pleasure. They 
were not alone, for there was 
a steady stream of people go- 
ing down the ramp with them, 
fore and aft, all flushed-faced 
and excited. 

Forrester abandoned himself to 
the holiday. “After all,” he 
shouted to Adne, “what does it 
matter if we’re going to be wiped 
out?” 

“Dear Charles,” she answered, 
“shut up and take your clothes 
off.” 

Surprised, but not very, For- 
rester saw that the whole pro- 
cession was beginning to shed its 
outer garments. Shaggy vests and 
film-and-net briefs, they were 



lining the floor, where busy glit- 
tering little cleaning creatures 
tugged them away into disposal 
units. “Why not?” he laughed, 
and kicked off his slippers at one 
of the cleaners, which reared 
back on its wheels like a kitten 
and caught it in mid-air. The 
crowd rolled down the ramp, 
shedding clothes at every step, 
until they were in a sort of high- 
vaulted lounge and the noise of 
laughter and talk was loud as a 
lynching. 

And then a door behind them 
closed. The cloying joymaker 
scent whisked away. Streams of 
a harsher, colder essence poured 
in upon them; and at once they 
were all standing there, nearly 
nude and cold sober. 

C harles Forrester had had 
something less than four 
decades of actual life — that is 
to say, of elapsed time measured 
by lungs that breathed and a 
heart that beat. The first part 
of that life, measured in decades, 
had taken place in the twentieth 
century. The second part, meas- 
ured in days, had taken place 
after more than half a millenium 
in the freezing tanks. 

Although those centuries had 
sped by tracelessly for Forres- 
ter, they represented real time 
to the world of men; each cen- 
tury a hundred years, each year 
365 days of twenty-four hours. 



166 



GALAXY 



Of all that had happened in 
those centuries Forrester had 
managed to learn only the small- 
est smattering. He had not 
learned, even yet, what powers 
this century could pack into a 
wisp of gas. Playing with the 
studs of his joymaker or sub- 
mitting to the whims of his 
friends, Forrester had tasted a 
variety of intoxicants and euph- 
orics, wake-up jolts and sleepy 
jolts. But he had never before 
tasted the jolt that drugged no 
senses but sharpened them all. 
Now he stood in this room, 
Taiko on one side of him and 
Adne in the circle of his arm 
surrounded by half a hundred 
other men and women; and was 
fully awake and sensing for the 
first time in his life. 

He turned to look at Adne. 
Her face was scrubbed bare, her 
eyes were looking at him un- 
winkingly. “You’re nasty in- 
side,” she said. 

What she said was the exact 
equivalent of a slap in the face, 
and Forrester accepted it as 
such. He growled, “You’re a 
trollop. I think your children 
are illegitimate, too.” He had 
not intended to say anything of 
the sort. 

Taiko said, “Shut up and 
crawl.” 

Over his shoulder and without 
passion, Forrester said: “You’re 
a two-bit phoney without an 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



ounce of principle or a thought 
in your head. Butt out, will 
you?” 

To his surprise, Adne was nod- 
ding in agreement; but she said: 
“Pure kamikaze, just like the 
trash you come from. Vulgar and 
a fool.” He hesitated, and she 
said impatiently, “Come on, 
kamikaze. Let it out. You’re 
jealous too, right?” 

Theirs was not the only argu 
ment going on; there was a bit- 
ter rumble of insult and vituper- 
ation all around them. Forrester 
was only marginally aware of 
it; his whole attention was con- 
centrated on Adne, on the girl 
he had thought he might be in 
love with, and his best efforts 
were devoted to trying to hurt 
her. He snapped, “I bet you’re 
not even pregnant!” 

She looked startled. “What?” 
“All that talk about picking 
a name! You probably just 
wanted to trick me into marry- 
ing you.” 

She stared at him blankly, 
then with revulsion. “Sweat! I 
meant our name. Charles, you 
talk like an idiot.” 

Taiko shrilled, “You’re both 
idiots! Crawl.” 

F orrester spared him a glance. 

Curiously, Taiko was down 
on his knees. 

For the first time Forrester 
realized that the floor was damp 

167 



— no, not damp, muddy. A thin 
gruel of softly oozing mud was 
pouring in from apertures in the 
wall. Others were getting down 
into the mud, too; and for possib- 
ly the thousandth time since be- 
ing taken from the freezer For- 
rester found himself torn be- 
tween two choices of puzzles to 
try to solve. What was going 
on here, exactly? And what the 
devil did Adne mean by “our” 
name? 

But she tugged at him im- 
patiently, slipping down to wal- 
low in the porridgy substance. 
“Come on,” she cried. “You’re 
not doing it right, but come on, 
you sweaty kamikaze!” 

All the while the air was be- 
ing recharged with the stimulant, 
if it was a stimulant, that had 
opened the gates of his senses 
for Forrester. It was like LSD, 
he thought, or a super-benze- 
drine; he was seeing a whole 
new spectrum, hearing bat- 
shrieks and subsonic roars, 
smelling, tasting, feeling things 
that had been out of his reach 
before. He perceived clearly that 
this was some sort of organized 
ritual he was in, understood that 
one of its purposes, at least, was 
to allow the release of tensions 
by saying whatever the inner 
mind had wanted to say, and 
the outer censor in the brain had 
forbidden. Allow it? He couldn’t 
stop it! He listened to the things 



he was saying to Adne and 
realized that at a later time, in 
an undrugged moment, he would 
be appalled. But he said them. 

And she nodded gravely and 
replied in kind. “Jealous!” she 
shrieked. “Typical manipulative 
ownership! Filthy inside, trashy!” 

“Why shouldn’t I be jealous? I 
loved you.” 

“Harem love!” sneered Taiko 
from beside him. The man was 
lying full length in the mud now 
— it had reached a depth of 
several inches and seemed to 
have stopped there. “She’s a 
brainless blot of passions but 
she’s human and how dare you 
try to own her?” 

“Fake!” howled Forrester. “Go 
pretend you’re a man! Bust up 
some machines!” He was furious, 
but in a part of his mind he was 
alert enough and analytical 
enough to be surprised that he 
wasn’t impelled to hit Taiko. Or 
Adne, for that matter. What he 
was impelled to do was to say 
wounding things, as true and 
hurtful as he could make them. 
He looked around him and saw 
that he was the only one still 
on his feet. The others were all 
full-length in the mud, writhing 
and creeping. Forrester dropped 
to his knees. “What’s this damn 
foolishness all about?” he de- 
manded. 

“Shut up and crawl,” grunted 
Taiko. “Get some of the animal 



168 



GALAXY 



out of you.” And Adne chimed 

In: 

“You’re spoiling it for all of 
us if you don’t crawl! You have 
to crawl before you can walk.” 

Forrester leaned down to her. 
“I don’t want to crawl!” 

“Have to. Helps you get out 
the rot. The secrets that fester — 
of course, you kamikazes like to 
decay.” 

“But I don’t have — ” 

And Forrester stopped, not 
because he voluntarily chose to 
stop talking just then but be- 
cause what he had been about 
to say was not true, and he 
simply could not say it. He had 
been about to say that he had 
no secrets. 

He had, in fact, more secrets 
than he could count; and one 
very large one which appalled 
him because his mouth wanted 
to blurt it out even while his 
brain screamed No! 

If he stayed in this room one 
more moment, Forrester knew, 
he would shout at the top of 
his voice the fact that he had 
been the one who helped the 
Sirian escape and thus made it a 
good gambling bet that the 
whole world of men would be 
destroyed. 

Dripping mud, panting, mum- 
bling to himself, Forrester 
climbed to his feet and forced 
himself to run — a staggering, 
broken-field run that dodged 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



flailing limbs and leaped over 
writhing bodies, that carried him 
through the angry rumble of 
the crawlers and out into a dress- 
ing chamber where he was 
sluiced down with fragrant spray, 
dried with warm blasts of air 
and bathed in hot light. Fresh 
garments appeared before him, 
but he took no pleasure in them. 
He had forgotten for a moment, 
but now he remembered again. 

He was the man who had de- 
stroyed the Earth. At any mom- 
ent he would be found out. 
And what his punishment might 
be, he dared not think. 

( ( TV yT an Forrester,” cried the 
-*-*-*- voice of a joymaker, 
“during the period of interrupted 
service a number of messages 
accumulated for you, of which 
the following three priority calls 
are urgent.” 

“Wait up,” said Forrester, 
startled. But there it was. Rum- 
maging through the neatly fold- 
ed heap of tee-shirt and Turkish 
pants, there was the macelike 
shape of a joymaker. “Ho,” he 
said. “I’ve got you again, eh?” 
“Yes, Man Forrester,” the joy- 
maker agreed. “Will you receive 
your messages?” 

“Um,” said Forrester. Then, 
cautiously, “Well, I will if any 
of them are of great urgency at 
this very moment. I mean, I 
don’t want somebody coming in 

169 



here and blowing my brains out 
while I’m talking to you.” 

“No such probability is evi- 
dent,” said the joymaker primly. 
“Nevertheless, Man Forrester, 
there are a number of highly im- 
portant messages.” 

Forrester sat down on a 
warmed bench and sighed. He 
said meditatively, “The thing is 
this, joymaker. I never seem to 
get to the end of a question, 
because two new questions pop 
up while I’m still trying to find 
the answer to the first one. So 
what I would like to do right 
now, I would like you to get 
me a cup of black coffee and a 
pack of cigarettes, right here in 
this nice, warm, safe room, and 
then I would like to drink the 
coffee and smoke the cigarettes 
and ask you some questions. 
Now, can I do that without dy- 
ing for it?” 

“Yes, Man Forrester. How- 
ever, it will take several min- 
utes for the coffee and cigar- 
ettes to be delivered, as they 
are not stock items in this facili- 
ty and must be — ” 

“I understand all that. Just 
get them. Now.” Forrester stood 
up and drew the baggy pants 
over his legs, thinking. At last 
he nodded to himself. 

“First question,” he said. “I 
just came out of a place where 
Adne Benson and a bunch of 
other people were wallowing in 



mud. What was that all about? 
— I mean,” he added hastily, “in 
a few words, what is it called 
and why do people do it?” 

“The function is called a 
‘crawl session’, Man Forrester, or 
simply ‘crawling.’ Its purpose is 
the release of tensions and in- 
hibitions for therapeutic pur- 
poses. Two major therapies are 
employed: First, there is a chem- 
ical additive in the air which 
suppresses inhibitors of all varie- 
ties, thus making it possible to 
articulate, and thus to relieve, 
many kinds of tensions. Second, 
the mere act of learning to crawl 
all over again is thought to pro- 
vide benefits. I have on imme- 
diate access, Man Forrester, 
some thirty-eight papers on var- 
ious aspects of the crawl ses- 
sion. Would you care to have 
me list them?” 

“Not in the least,” said For- 
rester. “That’s fine; I under- 
stand that perfectly. Now, sec- 
ond question.” 

There was a thunk; a recep- 
tacle opened beside him; For- 
rester reached in and took out 
a steaming and very large cup of 
coffee covered with a plastic 
lid. He worried the lid off, sought 
and found the cigarettes and 
lighter that accompanied the cof- 
fee, lit up, took a sip of coffee 
and said: 

“Adne Benson said something 
to me about choosing a name. I 



170 



GALAXY 



interpreted this to mean that 
she was, uh, well, pregnant. I 
mean, I thought she meant a 
name for a baby; but actually 
it was something else. Recipro- 
cal names? What are reciprocal 
names?” 

“Reciprocal names, Man For- 
rester,” lectured the joymaker, 
“are chosen, usually by two in- 
dividuals, less typically by larger 
groups, as private designations. 
A comparible institution from 
your original time, Man Forres- 
ter, might be the ‘pet’ name or 
nickname by which a person ad- 
dresses his or her spouse, or 
child, a close friend; however, 
the reciprocal name is used by 
each of the persons in addressing 
the other.” 

“Give me a for instance,” 
Forrester interrupted. 

CCTT'or instance,” said the joy- 
^ maker obediently, “in the 
universe of Adne Bensen and her 
two children the reciprocal 
names are ‘Tunt’ — a form of 
address from one child to the 
other — or ‘Mim’, when Miss 
Bensen addresses or is addressed 
by a child. As mentioned, this is 
not typical since more than two 
persons are involved. A better 
example from the same demesne 
would be that between Adne 
Bensen and Dr. Hara, where the 
reciprocal designation between 
them is ‘Tip’. Are those adequate 



for instances, Man Forrester?” 
“Yeah, but what’s this about 
Hara? You mean he and Adne 
had a pet name?” 

“Yes, Man Forrester.” 

“Yeah, but — Well, skip it.” 
Forrester glumly put down his 
coffee; it didn’t taste as good 
as he had thought it would. 
“Sounds confusing,” he muttered. 
“Confusing, Man Forrester?” 
“Yeah. I mean, if you and I 
have the same name, how do we 
know which one — oh, wait a 
minute. I see. If you and I have 
a name, then if you use it, ob- 
viously you mean me. And if I 
use it, I have to mean you.” 
“That is correct, Man Forres- 
ter. In practice it does not ap- 
pear that much confusion arises.” 
“All right, the hell with that, 
too. Let’s see.” Forrester frown- 
ed at his cigarette; that didn’t 
taste particularly good, either. 
He was unable to decide wheth- 
er the reason was that he had 
lost the taste for coffee and 
cigarettes, or whether these were 
simply miserable examples of 
their kind, or whether what tast- 
ed bad was his mood. He drop- 
ped the cigarette into the rest 
of the coffee and said irritably, 
“Question three : Now that I 

have you again, and plenty of 
money, is there some way I can 
keep from foolishly losing it all 
again? Can we like work out a 
budget?” 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT

“Certainly, Man Forrester. 
One moment. Yes. Thank you 
for waiting. I have obtained a 
preliminary investment schedule 
and prospectus of probable re- 
turns, and by investing a major 
fraction of your holdings in the 
Sea of Soup, with diversification 
in power, computation and eu- 
phoric utilities, you should have 
a firm annual income in excess 
of eleven million four hundred 
thousand dollars. This can be 
prorated by week or by day, if 
you wish, and automatic limits 
placed on the amounts you can 
spend or hypothecate. In this 
way it will be possible — Man 
Forrester!” 

Forrester was startled. “What 
the devil’s the matter with you?” 
“Your instructions, Man For- 
rester! Urgent priority override: 
statement made earlier that you 
are in no immediate danger of 
death is no longer true. Man 
Heinzlichen Jura de Syrtis Ma- 
jor, having filed appropriate 
bonds and guaranties — ” 

“Oh, no!” cried Forrester. 
“Yes, Man Forrester! Coming 
through the crawl chamber right 
now, armed, armored and look- 
ing for you!” 

XVI 

F orrester snapped tight the 
baggy trousers, tucked in the 
pullover, slipped his feet into 

172 



sandals and hooked the joymak- 
er to his belt. “Out!” he barked. 
“Which way?” 

“This way, Man Forrester.” 
An opening in the wall widened 
like a pair of parentheses and 
Forrester bolted through it. A 
lounge, a ramp, an open double 
door and he was out into the 
midway again, with the bright 
sun pounding down on him, the 
gay crowds staring at him casual- 
ly- 

He glanced around: yes, there 
was the DR vehicle, shining 
white overhead, its attendant 
with chin on hand gazing into 
space. “Where’s Heinzie?” he 
cried. 

“Following, Man Forrester. Do 
you wish to fight him here?” 
asked the joymaker. 

“Hell, no!” 

“Where would you prefer, Man 
Forrester?” 

“You idiot, I don’t want to 
fight him at all. I want to get 
away from him.” 

He was attracting attention 
from the crowd, he saw. Their 
expressions were no longer va- 
cant but puzzled, and beginning 
to be hostile. 

The joymaker said hesitantly, 
“Man Forrester, I must ask you 
to be specific. Do you wish to 
avoid combat with Man Heinz- 
lichen permanently?'’ 

“That’s the idea,” Forrester 
said bitterly, “but I see it’s a 



GALAXY 



little late for that now.” Be- 
cause the Martian was churning 
out of the double doors of the 
crawling building and heading 
straight for him. “Oh, well,” said 
Forrester. “Easy come, easy go.” 

/ T'he Martian planted himself 
in front of Forrester, puffing. 
He said, “Hello, dere. Sorry I 
kept you waiting so long.” 

“You didn’t have to hurry on 
my account,” said Forrester cau- 
tiously. He was scanning the 
Martian carefully for weapons, 
but there didn’t seem to be any- 
thing. He was wearing what 
looked like a wig, close blond 
curls that hugged his scalp, sur- 
rounded his ears and jawline and 
went down in back to the nape 
of his neck, but otherwise he 
was unchanged in appearance 
from the last time Forrester had 
seen him. And he did not even 
carry a stick. His joymaker was 
clipped to his belt; his hands 
were empty and hung loosely at 
his sides. 

“Veil,” said the Martian, “you 
were with de Forgotten Men, you 
know, and den I had other things 
to do. Anyway, here we are so 
let’s get it over with. Okay?” 

Forrester said honestly, “I 
don’t know what I’m supposed 
to do.” 

“Fight, you fool!” cried the 
Martian. “What de hell do you 
think you’re supposed to do?” 



“But I’m not even mad,” For- 
rester objected. 

“Dog sweat!” roared the Mar- 
tian. “/ am! Come on, fight, will 
you?” But his hands still hung 
at his side. 

Forrester shifted position cau- 
tiously, sparing the time for a 
glance around. The crowd was 
definitely interested now, form- 
ing a neat ring around them ; 
Forrester thought he could see 
bets being made on the outcome. 
The DR man overhead was 
watching them carefully. At 
least, Forrester thought, if I let 
him kill me they’ll just freeze 
me up again. And then they’ll 
put me together later on. And 
maybe the freezer isn’t such a 
bad place to be for a while, until 
this business with the Sirians gets 
straightened out . 

“Are you going to fight or 
not?” the Martian demanded. 

Forrester said, “Uh, one ques- 
tion.” 

“Veil?” 

“The way you talk. I had an 
argument about that the other 
day — ” 

“You’re stalling! What’s de 
matter with de way I talk?” 

“It’s a sort of German accent, 
I thought, but this other Martian 
was Irish and he talked the 
same way — 

“Irish? German?” Heinzlichen 
looked baffled. “Look, Forrester, 
on Mars we got 600-millibar 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



173 



pressure, you understand? You 
lose some of de high frequencies, 
dat’s all. I don’t know what 
‘German’ or ‘Irish’ is.” 

“Say, that’s interesting!” For- 
rester cried. “You mean it’s not 
an accent, really?” 

“I mean you wasted too much 
of my time already!” the Mar- 
tian cried, and leaped for his 
throat. And right there, in the 
bright midway with the ambula- 
tory plants jolting past him and 
the crowds cheering and shout- 
ing, Forrester found himself 
fighting for his life. The Martian 
was not only bigger than he was, 
the damned skunk was stronger! 
Fleetingly Forrester blazed with 
anger: how dare the Martian be 
stronger? What about the sup- 
position that light-gravity in- 
habitants would lose their muscle 
tone? Why was he not able to 
crush this flimsy, light-G crea- 
ture with a single blow? 

But he was not; the Martian 
was on top of him, systematical- 
ly thudding his head against the 
paving of the midway. It was 
Forrester’s good fortune that the 
flooring was a resilient rubber- 
like substance, not concrete; all 
the same he was developing a 
headache and his senses were 
spinning. And the Martian added 
insult to injury: “Get up and 
fight!” he bawled. “Dis is no 
fun!” 

That was the limit of Forres- 



ter’s civilization. He screamed in 
rage and surged up; the Martian 
went flying. Forrester was up 
and after him, flinging himself 
on top of him, a knee in the 
Martian’s throat; he saw the 
Martian’s joymaker loose by his 
side and caught it up — grab- 
bed it, clubbed it, smashed the 
macelike large end against the 
Martian’s skull. It rang like 
bronze. Even in his rage For- 
rester felt a moment’s astonish- 
ment; but clearly the close- 
cropped blond wig was not mere- 
ly hair. “Louse!” roared Forres- 
ter, enraged all over again; the 
Martian had prepared himself 
for this battle by wearing a hel- 
met! He shortened his stroke and 
clubbed the Martian across the 
face. Blood spurted; teeth broke. 
Again and again, and the Mar- 
tian tried to cry out but could 
not; again, again — 

Behind him the voice of the 
attendant from the DR cart said, 
“All right, all right, that’s 
enough. I’ll take care of him 
now.” 

Forrester rocked back on his 
haunches, panting hoarsely, star- 
ing at the terrible ruin he had 
made of the Martian’s face. He 
managed to gasp, “Is — is he 
dead?” 

“They don’t come any deader,” 
said the DR man. “Would you 
move a little bit? — Thanks. 
All right, he’s mine now. Wait 



174 



GALAXY 



here for the copper, please; he’ll 
take care of filling out a report.” 

VX7'hat happened next for For- 
’ * rester was hazy. He had a 
confused memory of returning 
to the lavatory facilities of the 
crawl room and getting cleaned 
up again, fresh clothes, a shower, 
a steam of reviving gases that 
woke him up and cleared his 
head. But when he was out of 
the room the fog returned. It 
was not the drain of his efforts 
that muddled his thinking, or 
the pain of his headache where 
Heinzie had bashed it against the 
pavement. It was pure psychic 
shock. 

He had destroyed a human 
life. 

Not really, he told himself at 
once. Not now. A short rest in 
the freezer and then he’s good 
as new! 

But it didn’t register with him; 
he was still in shock. 

Adne was waiting for him, with 
Taiko; they had seen the fight 
and had stayed to help him get 
straightened out afterward. Help 
him or help the Martian, For- 
rester thought bitterly; it prob- 
ably didn’t matter to them 
which. Nevertheless he was 
grateful for their help. Adne took 
him to her own home, left him 
there a minute, returned with 
the news that his apartment was 
ready for him again and escorted 



him there. And left him there 
with Taiko, who wanted to talk. 
“Nice fight, Charles. Shook you 
up, of course — hell, I remem- 
ber my own first one. Nothing 
to be ashamed of. But listen, if 
you’re going to come to work 
for the Society you’ve got to pull 
yourself together.” 

Forrester sat up and looked 
at Taiko. “What the devil makes 
you think I want to work for 
the Luddites?” 

“Come on, Charles. Look, take 
a shot of bracer, will you? That 
green stud, there on the han- 
dle — ” 

“Will you get out of here and 
leave me alone?” 

“Oh, for sweat’s sake,” cried 
Taiko impatiently. “Look, you 
said you wanted to help out 
with the Society’s program, 
right? Well, there’s no time to 
waste! This is the chance we’ve 
been waiting for, man! Every- 
body’s got the Sirians on their 
minds; they’ll be diving into the 
freezers so fast the teams won’t 
be able to handle them, and 
that’s when those of us who can 
face the world realistically will 
have a chance to take action. We 
can get rid of the machine men- 
ace once and for all if we — ” 
Taiko hesitated and gave For- 
rester a thoughtful look. Then 
he said: “Well, never mind that 
part of it just yet. Are you with 
us or against us?” 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



175 



XVII 



Forrester contemplated the 
problem of trying to explain to 
Taiko that his interest in the 
Ned Lud Society had been only 
an interest in making enough 
money to live on, and that when 
the Sirian had left him ninety- 
one million dollars that interest 
had evaporated. It did not seem 
worth the effort, so he said: “I 
guess I’m against you.” 

“Charles,” said Taiko, “you 
make me sick! You of all peo- 
ple! You, who have suffered so 
much from this age. Don’t you 
want to try to cure the evils of 
machine domination? Don’t you 
want — ” 

“I’ll tell you what I want,” 
said Forrester, rousing himself. 
“I want you to go away — fast!” 

“You’re not yourself,” said 
Taiko. “Look, when you get 
straightened out, give me a call. 
I’ll be hard to reach, because — 
Well, never mind why. But I’ll 
leave a special channel for you. 
Because I know you, Charles, 
and I know that you’ll have to 
decide to end these cowardly 
times and give Man back his — 
All right! I’m going!” 

When the door had closed be- 
hind him Forrester stared into 
space for more than an hour. 
Then he rolled over and went 
to sleep. 

His only regret was that sooner 
or later he would have to wake 
up. 

176 



X TThat Forrester could not un- 
* ' derstand was why it was 
taking them so long to arrest 
him. 

He began to see just why a 
criminal might give himself up. 
The waiting was hard to endure. 
Ten times an hour he reached 
for the joymaker to say, “I am 
the one who helped the Sirian 
escape. Report me to the police,” 
and ten times each hour he 
stopped himself. Not now, he 
said. Tomorrow, no doubt, or 
maybe even a few minutes from 
now; but not just now. 

From time to time the joy- 
maker informed him of messages 
— forty-five of them the first 
day alone. Forrester refused to 
accept them all. He didn’t want 
to see anyone until — until — 
well, he didn’t want to see any- 
one at the moment. (He could 
not make up his mind at just 
what moment the world would so 
clarify itself to him that he 
would be willing to start living 
in it again; but he always knew 
that that time was certainly not 
yet.) He explored the resources 
of his apartment, the joymaker 
and his own mind. He ate fan- 
tastic meals and drank odd foam- 
ing beverages that tasted like 
stale beer or celery-flavored 
malted milks. He listened to 
music and watched canned plays. 



GALAXY 



He wished desperately for a deck 
of cards, but the joymaker did 
not seem to understand his des- 
cription of them and so solitaire 
was denied him; but he found 
almost the same anesthesia in 
reading and reading over again 
what scraps of written matter he 
had on hand. His late wife’s let- 
ter he practically memorized; his 
briefing manual to this century 
he studied until his fingers were 
weary from turning the pages. 

On the second day there were 
nearly seventy messages. For- 
rester refused them all. 

At his direction the joymaker 
displayed for him selected news 
pictures on the view-wall. The 
only subject Forrester would al- 
low himself an interest in was 
the progress of the trouble with 
the Sirians. There was strange- 
ly little news after the first day 
— negative reports from drone 
patrols in every quadrant of the 
heavens, a diminishing flow of 
projections and estimates of 
when an attack might be ex- 
pected. The consensus seemed to 
be, not for several weeks at least. 
Forrester could not understand 
that at all. He remembered quite 
distinctly that Sirius was some- 
thing like fifty light-years away, 
and the joymaker confirmed that 
no way had been found to ex- 
ceed the speed of light. But fi- 
nally he gathered that it was 
thought the Sirians had some sort 



of faster-than-light message cap- 
ability, as did Earth for that 
matter, and even if the fleeing 
Sirian might not make it back to 
his own planet he might send a 
message. And it was a possibility, 
at least, that some wandering 
Sirian war patrol might be near 
Sol. 

But none made itself evident; 
and on the third day there were 
only a dozen messages for For- 
rester; and he refused them all. 

What he did with most of his 
time was sleep. 

He had ninety-one million dol- 
lars and perfect health. He could 
think of nothing better to spend 
either of them on. 

(t Toymaker! Tell me what I 
•P did wrong with Adne.” 
“Wrong in what sense, Man 
Forrester? I have no record of 
antisocial acts.” 

“Don’t split hairs with me. I 
mean, why didn’t she like me 
after the first few days?” 

The joymaker began to answer 
with statements about hormone 
balances, imprinting and the in- 
eluctable components of emo- 
tions, but Forrester was having 
none of it. “Get me a beer,” 
he ordered, “and give me specific 
answers. You hear everything?” 
“Right, Man Forrester. Except 
when instructed otherwise.” 

“All right. I offended her. 
How?” 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



177 



“I cannot evaluate the magni- 
tude of the offenses, Man For- 
rester, but I can list certain acts 
which would appear to be signi- 
ficantly greater than others. Item, 
you refused her offer of a re- 
ciprocal name.” 

“That was bad?” Forrester 
asked. 

“It is offensive by social con- 
vention, Man Forrester, yes.” 
The glass of beer appeared by 
Forrester’s couch; he tasted it 
and made a face. 

“No, not that,” he said. “What 
was that other thing, the beer 
with some kind of rasperry 
sauce?” 

“ Berlinerweisse , Man Forres- 
ter?” 

“Yeah, get me one of those. 
Go on with the list.” 

“Item, your actions when Man 
Heinzlichen Jura de Syrtis Ma- 
jor filed intent to kill you were 
considered contemptible in cer- 
tain lights.” 

“Didn’t she understand that I 
just wasn’t used to the way 
things go now?” 

“Yes, Man Forrester, she did. 
Nevertheless she considered your 
behavior contemptible. Item, you 
allowed yourself to become im- 
poverished. Item, you criticized 
her for a relationship with other 
males.” 

The large goblet of pale beer 
appeared with a little flask of 
dark-red syrup; Forrester de- 



canted the syrup into the beer 
and sipped it It too tasted terri- 
ble, but he had run out of things 
to ask for and drank it. “It was 
only that I loved her,” he said 
irritably. 

“There are aspects to the syn- 
drome love’ which we cannot dis- 
tinguish, Man Forrester.” 

ttTT ell. I don’t expect you to. 

-*■ You’re a machine. But I 
thought Adne was a woman.” 

“I can only surmise from the 
evidence of her responses that 
she did not comprehend or ac- 
cept your behavior either, Man 
Forrester.” 

“I have to admit you’ve got a 
point there,” sighed Forrester, 
putting down the goblet and get- 
ting up to roam around. “Well, 
never mind.” He rubbed his chin 
thoughtfully, then waved a 
hand; a mirror appeared and he 
studied his face in it. He looked 
like a bum. Hair unkempt, beard 
beginning to grow again. “Oh, 
hell,” he said. 

The joymaker made no 
answer. 

What Forrester really wanted 
to know — whether anyone had 
come to suspect him of being the 
one who had let the Sirian es- 
cape — he dared not ask. The 
questions he did ask, on the 
other hand, turned out to have 
answers as confusing as the 
questions were. Even simple 



178 



GALAXY 



questions. He had asked after his 
friend among the Forgotten Men, 
Jerry Whitlow, for example. He 
had not been surprised to find 
out that Whitlow was dead — he 
had seen that happen; or to 
learn that his revival was prob- 
lematical ; but he still did not 
know what the joymaker meant 
by saying Whitlow was “return- 
ed to reserve.” It seemed to 
mean that Whitlow’s body had 
been used as raw material, per- 
haps in one of the organic lakes 
like the “Sea of Soup” from 
which the world’s food supplies 
came; but Forrester was too re- 
pelled by that notion to follow 
it any farther, and even so he 
could not understand why Whit- 
low’s revival would then be 
“problematical”. 

“How many messages today, 
joymaker?” he asked idly. 

“There are no messages for 
you today, Man Forrester.” 
Forrester turned to look at the 
thing. That was a welcome sur- 
prise — and change was welcome 
— but it was worrisome, too. Had 
everyone forgotten him? 

“No messages?” 

“None that you have not al- 
ready refused, Man Forrester.” 
“Doesn’t anyone want to talk 
to me?” 

“As far as indicated by the 
message log, Man Forrester, only 
Man Taiko wishes to talk to you. 
He left special instructions in 



regard to forwarding of com- 
munications. But that was six 
days ago.” 

Forrester was startled. “How 
the devil long have I been 
here?” 

“Nineteen days, Man Forres- 
ter.” 

He took a deep breath. 

Nineteen days! How little his 
so-called friends cared for him! 
he told himself with self-pity. 
If they really liked him they 
would have broken the door 
down if necessary. 

But it was not all bad. Nine- 
teen days? But surely if he were 
going to be arrested for help- 
ing the Sirian escape it would 
not have taken this long. Was 
it safe to assume the heat was 
off? Did he dare go back into 
the world of men? 

He made up his mind rapidly; 
and before he could change it, 
acted at once. “Joymaker! Get 
me cleaned up. Shave, bath, new 
clothes. I’m going outside!” 

T Tis resolve lasted him through 

*■ the cleaning-up process and 
into the condominium hall, but 
then it began to dissipate. 

No one was in the hall; there 
were no sounds. But to Forrester 
it seemed like a jungle trail with 
unknown dangers on every side. 
He ordered an elevator cab to 
take him to slideway level and 
when the door opened he en-

tered it cautiously, as though an 
enemy might be lurking inside. 

But it too was empty. And so 

— he found a moment later — 
was the wide hovercraft street. 
There was simply nothing there. 

Forrester stared around, un- 
able to believe what he saw. No 
pedestrians — well, that was un- 
derstandable. There were sel- 
dom very many, and he had no 
idea what time of day it was. 
No hovercraft? That was harder 
to accept. Even if for a moment 
none were in sight, he should be 
able to hear the hissing roar of 
their passage somewhere in the 
city. But to see no aircraft, no 
sign of life at all — that was 
flatly unbelievable. 

Where was everybody? 

He said, with a quaver in his 
voice: “Get me a cab.” 

‘‘One will arrive in two min- 
utes, Man Forrester.” And it did 

— a standard automated air cab; 
and Forrester still had not seen 
a human being. He climbed in 
quickly, closed the door and or- 
dered it to take him up — not 
up to any place in particular, 
just up, so that he could see 
farther in all directions. 

But no matter how far he 
looked, no one was there. 

Words forced themselves out: 
“Joymaker! What happened?” 

“In what respect, Man For- 
rester?” the machine benignly 
asked. 



“Where did everybody go? 
Adne? The kids?” 

“Adne Benson and her chil- 
dren, Man Forrester, at present 
are being processed for storage in 
Sublake Emergency Facility 
Nine. However, it is not as yet 
known whether space will be 
available for them there on a 
permanent basis, and so the lo- 
cation must be considered tenta- 
tive pending the completion of 
additional facilities — ” 

“You mean they’re dead?" 
“Clinically dead, Man Forres- 
ter. Yes.” 

“How about — ” Forrester 
cast about in his mind — “let’s 
see, that Martian. Not Heinzie, 
the one with the Irish name, 
Kevin O’Rourke; is he dead 
too ” 

“Yes, Man Forrester.” 

“And the Italian ballerina I 
met at the restaurant where the 
Forgotten Men hung out?” 

“Also dead, Man Forrester.” 
“What the hell happened?" he 
shouted. 

The joymaker replied care- 
fully, “Speaking objectively, 
Man Forrester, there has been 
an unforecast increase in the 
number of commitments to 
freezing facilities. More than 
ninety-eight point one per cent 
of the human race is now in 
cryogenic storage. In subjective 
terms, the causes are not well 
established but appear to relate 



180 



GALAXY 



to the probability of invasion 
by extra-Solarian living crea- 
tures, probably Sirian.” 

“You mean everybody com- 
mitted suicide?” 

“No, Man Forrester. Many 
preferred to be killed by others; 
for example, Man Hfeinzlichen 
Jura de Syrtis Major, who, you 
will recall, elected to be killed 
by you.” 

Forrester sank back against 
the seat. “Holy sweet heaven,” 
he muttered to himself. Dead! 
Nearly the whole human race, 
dead! It was more than he could 
take in at once. He sat staring 
into space until the joymaker 
said apologetically, “Man For- 
rester, do you wish to select a 
destination?” 

“No — wait a minute, yes! 
Maybe I do. You said ninety- 
eight per cent of the human race 
is dead.” 

“Ninety-eight point one, yes, 
Man Forrester.” 

“But that means there are 
some who are still alive, right? 
Are there any I know?” 

“Yes, Man Forrester. Certain 
classes are still in vital state in 
large proportion because of spe- 
cial requests made for their ser- 
vices — e.g., medical specialists 
working in the freezer stations. 
Also there are others. One you 
know is Man Taiko. He is not 
only in vital state but has, as 
you know, given special instruc- 



tions in regard to receiving mes- 
sages from you. Another is the 
Reverend Sam Tshumu, and an- 
other — ” 

“Never mind any other,” chied 
Forrester. “And never mind mes- 
sages, either. Just take me to 
Taiko, right away! I want to 
see someone who’s alive!” 

Because — went the unspoken 
corollary — he didn’t want to see 
the ruins left by the dead. Not as 
long as he was so completely 
convinced that it was himself 
who had killed them. 

XVIII 

T)ut as it turned out, the cab 
did not take him to see Tai- 
ko after all. 

It did what it could. The joy- 
maker programmed it properly 
enough, and Forrester found 
himself high in a building of 
bright ruby crystal, at a door 
inscribed The Ned Lud Society. 
Inside was what he supposed 
was the latterday equivalent of 
an office — though it was warm 
and damp and a fountain played 
among ferns in it. But no one 
was inside. 

“What the devil’s the matter 
with you, joymaker?” he de- 
manded. “Where’s Taiko?” 

“Man Forrester,” said the joy- 
maker, “there is an anomaly 
here. My records indicate Man 
Taiko’s presence at this place, 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



181 



but clearly they are wrong. My 
records have never been wrong 
before.” 

“Well, let me talk to him. You 
said he’d left special instruc- 
tions — ” 

“Yes, Man Forrester.” Pause. 
Then Taiko’s voice came on: 

“That you, Charles? Glad to 
hear from you. I’m busy now, 
but I’ll be in touch when I get 
a chance — only don’t refuse my 
message this time, will you?” 

That was all. “Wait a minute,” 
cried Forrester. “Taiko!” 

The joymaker interrupted him. 
“Man Forrester, that was a re- 
cording.” 

Forrester growled profanely. 
He walked around the office, 
examining it, but without find- 
ing anything that would help him 
locate Taiko. “Well, hell,” he 
said. “Let’s see. You said some- 
body else I knew was still 
alive?” 

“Reverend Sam Tshumu is 
still alive, Man Forrester.” 

“And who is Reverend Sam 
Tshumu? I mean, don’t give me 
all his statistics; just tell me 
what makes you think I know 
him.” 

“Acquaintanceship is indicated 
from the fact that he endeavored 
to make contact with you at 
the time of your first emerging 
from cryogenic storage, Man 
Forrester. However, Man Tshu- 
mu may not be contacted direct- 



ly at present. If you wish to 
see him or speak with him you 
may communicate with the war- 
den of the Shoggo Municipal De- 
tention Facility.” 

.Forrester swore. “Anybody 
else?” 

“Man Forrester, Edwardino 
Wry is also ambient. Do you 
consider that he is known to 
you?” 

“I doubt it, because I never 
heard of the son — wait a min- 
ute. Was he one of the ones that 
beat me up?” 

“Yes, Man Forrester.” 

“Well, I don’t want to see him. 
Forget it, joymaker,” said For- 
rester. “I guess I’ll just wait for 
Taiko.” 

Hp'hree or four times he thought 
he saw people, but he was 
only able to get close to one of 
them and it said civilly, “We 
are not human, Man Forrester. 
We are merely a special-purpose 
service unit diverted to aid at 
the cryogenic facilities.” It had 
looked like a pretty young 
blonde in a bikini, perhaps a 
barmaid somewhere, Forrester 
thought; but was too dispirited 
to inquire. Apart from those 
there was no one in sight in 
Shoggo. 

He walked aimlessly, shaking 
his head. 

His long days of self-imposed 
exile had let most of the guilt 



182 



GALAXY 



evaporate from him. He no long- 
er felt either fearful of dis- 
covery or humiliated. The Sirian 
had used him as a tool, true, 
but if it had not been him it 
would have been someone else. 
Anyway, he was more con- 
cerned about this world. The 
year 2527 was a great dis- 
appointment to him. He could 
think of no other age when the 
response of the populace to a 
threat of death would have been 
such universal suicide. It was 
simply crazy . 

Of course, he reminded him- 
self, death was not the same 
to these people as it had been 
to his contemporaries. Death 
was no longer necessarily per- 
manent. It was like fleeing to a 
neutral country to sit out a war, 
and heaven knew there were 
lots of 20th century examples of 
that. 

Nevertheless, in Charles For- 
rester’s opinion the world of 2527 
A.D. simply was not behaving 
well. It was chicken. 

Forrester filled his lungs and 
shouted: “You are all cowards! 
The world’s better off without 
you!” His voice echoed emptily 
among the tall, hard building 
faces. 

“Man Forrester,” said the joy- 
maker, “were you addressing 
me?” 

“I was not. Shut up,” said For- 
rester. “No, cancel that. Get me 



a cab.” And when it came he 
took it back to the broad hover- 
craft way where he and Jerry 
Whitlow had hidden out as two 
of the Forgotten Men. But there 
were no more Forgotten Men in 
evidence, not wherever he looked, 
no matter how loud he called 
out. “Take me to Adne Bensen’s 
home,” he commanded, and the 
cab flew him into the entrance 
port at the mid-tower level of the 
building they had shared, but 
there was no one visible there 
either. Not in the streets, not in 
the halls, not even in the apart- 
ment, after Forrester had com- 
manded the joymaker to let him 
in. 

He ordered himself a meal and 
sat on the edge of a sort of couch 
in the children’s room, feeling put 
upon and sad. When he had fin- 
ished eating he said: “Joymaker, 
try getting Taiko for me again.” 
“Yes, Man Forrester . There 
is no new message, Man Forres- 
ter.” 

“Don’t give me that! Say it’s 
priority, like you’re always doing 
to me.” 

“You do not have the author- 
ity to classify a message priority, 
Man Forrester.” 

“I do if I say I’m planning to 
kill him,” Forrester said cunning- 
ly. “You have to notify him of 
my intentions, right?” 

“I do indeed, Man Forrester, 
but not until you have filed ap- 



184 



GALAXY 



propriate bonds and guaranties. 
Until you have done so your 
notice cannot be effective. Do 
you wish to file, Man Forrester?” 
“Well,” said Forrester, thinking 
about filling out forms and sign- 
ing documents, “I guess not, no. 
Isn’t there any way I can get 
through to him?” 

The joymaker said, “I have a 
taped message from him which I 
can display on the view-wall if 
you wish, Man Forrester. It is 
not, however, directly addressed 
to you.” 

“Display the son of a gun 
then,” ordered Forrester. “And 
make it snappy!” 

“Yes, Man Forrester.” The 
view-wall lighted up obediently; 
but what appeared on it was not 
Taiko Hironibi. It was a tall, 
largely built woman with a com- 
manding presence who said: 
“Girl Goldilocks and Terror of 
Bears!” 

T^orrester was startled. “What 
the devil!” he cried. But the 
voice went on : 

“Bears! Think of bears. Great 
biting creatures, shaggy-haired, 
smell of animal sweat and rot. A 
bear can kill a man — crunch, 
crush his head, smash, crash his 
spine, zip, rip his heart.” At every 
word the woman’s image acted 
out crunching, smashing, ripping. 

“Hey,” said Forrester, “I didn’t 
order any bedtime stories!” 

THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



The joymaker said, with al- 
most a tone of apology, “Man 
Forrester, there is a technical dif- 
ficulty. I suggest you permit this 
tape to finish.” And meanwhile 
the woman was orating : 

“A girl child, little as you. Lit- 
tler. Little as you used to be 
when you were little. Call the girl 
. give her a name . let her 
be called, oh, Goldilocks. Golden 
hair; locks of gold. Sweet, small, 
defenseless girl.” 

Forrester snarled: “Will you 

turn this damn thing off?” 

“Man Forrester,” admitted the 
joymaker, “I can’t. Please be pa- 
tient.” 

“Imagine this girl doing a 
naughty thing!” cried the wom- 
anm. “Imagine her going where 
she should not go, where her 
mother/father told her not to go. 
Imagine her rejecting their wise 
counsel!” 

Forrester sank back on the 
couch and said glumly, “If you 
can’t turn it off, at least get me 
a drink while I’m waiting. Scotch 
and water.” 

“Yes, Man Forrester.” 

The view-wall was showing 
real bears now, large and fero- 
cious grizzlies, while the woman 
chanted : “And Goldilocks goes to 
the bear lair — roaring, biting, 
slashing bears! But they are not 
home. 

“They are not home and she 
eats their food. She sits where 

185 



they sit, lies where they lie, and 
sleeps. 

“She sleeps, and the bears 
come home!” 

Forrester’s drink appeared; he 
tasted it and glowered, for it was 
not Scotch. As best as he could 
tell from the flavor, it was a sort 
of salty applejack. 

“The bears come home! The 
bears come home and their muz- 
zles foam; the bears come back 
ready to attack, the bears come 
in with their jaws agrin! 

“Red eyes glowing! (She 
sleeps, unknowing.) 

“Claws that rend (is this the 
end?), paws that break (she 
starts to wake) , teeth that bite — 

“And Goldilocks opens her 
eyes, screams loudly, leaps to her 
feet and takes flight.” 

The woman on the view-wall 
paused, staring sorrowfully 
straight into Forrester’s eyes. Her 
oratorial stance relaxed; her eyes 
seemed to lose their dramatic 
glow, and she said conversation- 
ally: 

“Now, you see? What a ter- 
rible thing to happen to a little 
girl, and all because she rejected 
her parents. She ran and ran and 
ran and ran, a long, long time, 
and then she got back to her 
father/mother and promised nev- 
er to reject them again, and 
made a good adjustment. Now 
please prepare to answer ques- 
tions on the theme: “Is it wise to 



take chances on going to places 
your father /mother do not ap- 
prove?” She smiled, bowed and 
vanished. 

The joymaker said, “Man For- 
rester, thank you for waiting. 
There are certain nexial recur- 
sions not operative at the pres- 
ent time. Shall I attempt to dis- 
play the Taiko tape again?” 
“Oh, that explains it! No, 
thanks. Just tell me one thing,” 
said Forrester. “Tell me how I 
can get myself nicely, but not 
painfully, killed. Because I feel 
left out of things. I want to be 
in the freezer too.” 

“That is not possible, Man 
Forrester.” 

“Don’t give me that! It’s got 
to be possible — everybody else 
did it, right? And I can see why. 
Nobody for company, the ma- 
chines breaking down — ” 

“We are not breaking down, 
Man Forrester.” 

“That’s your opinion. Anyway, 
all I have to do is call a death- 
reversal car and cut my throat, 
right? Then I’m dead and it’s up 
to you-all to freeze me.” 

“No, Man Forrester. You may 
not do this. If you are killed in 
any way you will be revived at 
once, even if only on external 
heart-lung apparatus.” 

“The devil you say! Why?” 
“Because, Man Forrester, you 
are about to be arrested. The 
coppers are coming for you now.” 



186 



GALAXY

'T'wo coppers boiled into the 
room and manhandled him 
out into the corridor to the fly-in, 
where a police cab was waiting 
for him. They thrust him into 
it and watched as it soared away 
with him. He shouted out to 
them vainly: “Wait! Come back! 
I didn’t do anything!” 

“That is to be determined, 
Man Forrester,” said a voice 
from a speaker grille over his 
head. “Meanwhile, please come 
with us.” 

The “please” was totally sense- 
free, of course: Forrester had no 
choice. “But what did I do?" he 
begged. 

“Your arrest has been ordered, 
Man Forrester,” said the quiet, 
unemotional voice of the central 
computation facility. “Do you 
wish a precis of the charge 
against you?” 

“You bet!” Forrester stared 
around fearfully. There was no 
one at the controls, but there 
didn’t seem to be a need for any- 
one; the car was sliding rapidly 
through the air toward the lake 
front. 

“Your arrest has been ordered, 
Man Forrester,” repeated the 
computer voice. “Do you wish 
a precis of the charge against 
you?” 

“Damn it, I just said I did!” 
They were over blue water and 



mo'/'ng fast. Forrester hammered 
the fleshy part of his fist agains 
a window experimentally, bu 
naturally enough the glass die 
not break. It was just as well, o 
course: there was no place fo 
him to go. 

“Your arrest,” said the com 
puter voice calmly, “has beei 
ordered, Man Forrester. Do you 
wish a precis of the charge 
against you?” 

Forrester swore furiously and 
hopelessly. They were approach 
ing a metal island in the lake 
and the arcraft was dropping 
toward it. “All I want,” he said 
“is to know what the devil’s go 
ing on. Joymaker! Can you tel 
me what this is all about?” Bu' 
the mace clipped to him onlj, 
said: 

“We are all the same. Mar: 
Forrester. Do you wish a precis 
of the charge against you?” 

By the time the aircraft land- 
ed Forrester had regained con 
trol of himself. Obviously some 
thing was wrong with the centra’ 
computation facilities, but equal- 
ly obviously there was nothing 
much he could do about it now 
When two more coppers, waiting 
on the hardstand for the police 
car to alight, seized his arms and 
pulled him out of the door, he 
did not resist. The coppers’ grip 
was quite unbreakable and their 
strength far greater than his own 

He saw no human being and 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



187 



no other automata, while he was 
herded like livestock down 
through underground passages, 
under the lake waters, until fi- 
nally he was pushed into a door 
that locked behind him. 

He was in a cell. It held a bed, 
a chair and a table, nothing else. 
Or nothing that was visible; its 
wall were mined with the usual 
electronic maze, however, be- 
cause a voice said at once: "Man 
Forrester, message.” 

“Drop sick,” said Forrester. 
“No, I don’t want a precis of the 
charge against me.” 

But the message which follow- 
ed was not the repetitious drone 
of the faulty machines. It was 
Taiko’s voice, and a wall of the 
cell sprang into light to show his 
face. “Hi, there, Chuck,” he said. 
“You said you wanted to see 
me. 

Forrester exhaled sharply. 
“Thank God,” he said. “Look, 
Taiko, something’s gone wrong 
with the machines and I’m in 
jail!” 

Taik’o bland face creased in a 
smile. “Number one,” he said, 
“there’s nothing wrong with the 
machines — in fact, something’s 
going right with them! And num- 
ber two, of course you’re in jail. 
Who do you think brought you 
here?” 

“Here? You mean you’re here 
too?” 

Taiko grinned and nodded. 



“Not more’n fifty meters away, 
pal. So now we come right down 
to it. Are you with the Ned Lud 
Society or are you against it? 
Because this is our chance. Ev- 
erything’s so stirred up for fear 
of a Sirian invasion that we can 
straighten things out the right 
way. Know what I mean by the 
right way?” 

“Smash the machines?” For- 
rester guessed. “You mean, you 
and I—” 

“Oh, not just you and I,” said 
Taiko triumphantly. “We’ve got 
a lot of help we didn’t have be- 
fore. See?” 

And he touched a control, and 
the field of view dropped back 
and widened. 

Taiko did indeed have a lot of 
help. There were perhaps a doz- 
en of them, or almost, Forrester 
saw dazedly. They were in the 
same room with Taiko. One or 
two of them were human or ro- 
bot. 

The others were neither. 

The others looked out at For- 
rester through eyes that were a 
circlet of gleaming green dots. 
They were Sirians. 

“You see, pal,” said Taiko, 
“we’ve got something going for 
us. Our friends here may be 
funny looking, but they’re or- 
ganic. Working with them we can 
get rid of the machine problem 
once and for all, dig? So are you 
with us or against us?” 



188 



GALAXY 



Forrester tried to answer and 
could not; things were happening 
too fast for him again. There 
were too many factors to con- 
sider, and he didn’t understand 
any of them. Destroy the ma- 
chines? Well, yes; maybe Taiko 
was right. But turn over the 
world to the Sirians? 

Taiko said impatiently, 
“Doesn’t matter, of course. If 
you’re with us, good. If you’re 
not — there’s nothing you can do 
about it! But come on up here 
and we’ll talk it over, hear?” 
And there was a faint click, 
and the door of Forrester’s cell 
sprang open, and a line of pale 
glowing green arrowheads point- 
ed the way for him to walk. 

TT'orrester marched like a man 
in a dream. He kept wishing 
Adne were there for him to talk 
to (but she was deep in the li- 
quid-helium sleep of death), or 
that someone, anyone, some per- 
son with knowledge and kindness 
would tell him what to do. I wish 
I’d tried to find Dorothy, he said 
to himself. Or Wilton. I wish — 
Wishes didn’t help. He was 
hundreds of meters under the 
surface of the lake in a world 
that was dissolving around him. 
When he reached the end of his 
walk and found Taiko, looking 
fretful, exhausted and triumph- 
ant, waiting for him, it was as 
though the dream had turned 



into a nightmare and he was its 
helpless captive. “Yes or no, ’ 
cried Taiko. “You want to help?’’ 

“I don’t know,” Forrester said 
humbly. “Will you explain it to 
me?” 

One of the Sirians moved rest- 
lessly, but did not speak. Its cir- 
clet of green eyes winked like 
gems, dimmed only faintly by the 
sheen of the plastic envelope that 
kept it from the attack of Earth’s 
atmosphere. 

“Sweat, man,” groaned Taiko. 
“I don’t have time for this! You 
know what we’re doing? We’ve 
recruited half of central compu- 
tation already. It’s tricky work, 
but we’re doing it. Another week 
and we’ll have the whole damned 
complex of machine thinking de- 
stroyed — then mankind can take 
care of itself!” 

“With these?” asked Forrester. 
“And what about their friends 
out in space?” 

The Sirians looked on impas- 
sively. Taiko frowned. “Don’t fret 
yourself about them,” he said. 
“They’re just technical advisors. 
I’m the one that’s running this 
show, and don’t forget it; when 
we finish busting up the machines 
they’re going home.” 

Forrester sat down, trying to 
understand, and not succeeding 
very well. He heard Taiko’s 
harsh, staccato voice go on and 
on — the Sirians had bargained 
with him and come to a treaty; 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



189 



once Earth’s machine computa- 
tion facilities were destroyed they 
would go back to their own dis- 
tant planet and stay there. Their 
only interest in Earth was as a 
threat. Without machines it 
would be no threat . 

“I don’t trust them,” muttered 
Forrester, more to himself than 
to Taiko. But he could not help 
but be impressed with Taiko’s 
prospects. 

TTCThen Forrester, all unwitting, 

’ ' loosed the escaping Sirian 
into space, he won Taiko’s hard- 
est battle for him. The Earth re- 
sponded predictably by rushing 
into the familiar safety of frozen 
death, waiting for the danger to 
pass — or anesthetized against 
the shock and trouble that would 
come if it did not. So many 
were gone that the few remaining 
living humans who possessed any 
organization or purpose were the 
medical personnel of the freezers 
themselves. 

And Taiko. 

Taiko saw his chance. Alone 
he could not isolate the machine- 
intelligence circuits that he de- 
tested. But with help he could, 
for everyone who might stop him 
was deep in frozen sleep. Where 
to find help?? 

Why, the other Sirians, of 
course. They had the technical 
skill, they had the motivation — 
and they had not followed the 



great bulk of the world’s popu- 
lation into cryogenic death. 

After all, why should they? If 
the Sirians did invade, they at 
least had nothing to fear. 

“So all we have to do,” cried 
Taiko, “is break up the comput- 
ers. Then my friends here go 
home, and we start waking up 
the human race again — a little 
at a time. The ones who are 
sympathetic, the ones who want 
man to be free again. The oth 
ers — ” 

“Well, pal, what do you think? 
They like being where they are. 
Maybe we’ll just leave them.” 
He laughed suddenly. “Be a good 
joke on them, at that. They 
wanted to die, we’ll let them!” 
Forrester was suddenly jumpy. 
“Taiko,” he said, “I have to 
think. Maybe you’re right. Bui 
I’ve just now come to the con 
elusion that I don’t know enough 
about this world to know whethc 
I’m for it or against it.” 

Taiko waved a hand largely. 
“Take your time. The jail’s 
yours. Just remember, there’s 
nothing you can do anyway.” 
And he went back to his Sirians, 
and their huddling over the re- 
mote controls of the central com- 
putation facility. 

Forrester went out into the 
bright, empty corridors of Shog 
go’s underwater jail and faced 
his decisions. Item, clearly there 
was something wrong with a 



190 



GALAXY 



world in which people elected to 
die at the first serious challenge. 
But one the other hand — item 
— who was T aiko to make the 
world’s decisions for it? 

He saw a bright light ahead 
and walked toward it, and it was 
sunlight. Sunlight shining down 
a shaft, and a white death-rever- 
sal car humming quietly to itself 
as it waited. 

Waited for what? 

There was an attendant, but it 
was not human. At Forrester’s 
hail it said, “Man Forrester, your 
arrest has been ordered. Do you 
wish a precis of the charge 
against you?” 

“You’re a broken record, ma- 
chine,” he sighed, and sat down. 
Somewhere in the near distance 
there was a whir and gasp of 
some kind of machine working, 
but he could not see its source, 
and lacked the energy to look for 
it. 

The trouble with trying to 
make a decision, he saw, was that 
he really didn’t have a decision 
to make. There was no way out 
of this place without Taiko’s con- 
sent, and Taiko’s consent would 
be given only to Taiko’s friends. 

“I might as well join ’em,” he 
said aloud. 

But the curious thing was, he 
didn’t want to. As soon as it be- 
came clear to him that he had 
only one choice to make, that 
choice became abhorrent. 



“Hello, Mr. Forrester,” said a 
voice from somewhere out of 
sight. 

i 

r Tphe voice came from a small 
hospital-type room, where a 
man lay on a bed. He was heav- 
ily bandaged, and beside him 
was a whirring machine that 
seemed coupled to his body. “I 
thought I heard you talking to 
the DR machine,” he said. “Re- 
member me? I’m Sam Tshumu.” 
Forrester came closer, frown- 
ing. “I — I don’t think so.” But 
something was nagging at his 
mind. “Oh,” he said, remember- 
ing. “You tried to get in touch 
with me. But I don’t think we’ve 
ever met.” 

“You sure, Mr. Forrester?” 
And then Forrester leaned over 
him and saw a dark brown face, 
almost hidden by the bandages, 
with only bright black eyes look 
ing out at him. 

“My God,” he said. “Yes! You 
were the one who kept those 
hoods from killing me! What are 
you doing here?” 

Tshumu might have smiled; it 
was almost impossible to tell, 
with the bandages, but there was 
a movement at the corners of his 
eyes. “That’s what I’m doing 
here, Mr. Forrester. I interfered 
when I shouldn’t have, so I’m 
under arrest. I’m the only one 
still here, you see, because our 
friend Taiko has special plans 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT 



191 



for me. I’m a Utopian, and we’ve 
had our disagreements in the/ 
past.” 

“What do you mean, special 
plans?” 

The eyes were filled with pain. 
“I’m dead, Mr. Forrester. They 
brought me back on a temporary 
basis to face trial, but I’m not 
self-viable; without the heart- 
lung equipment I’d be really 
dead. Only that’s not good 
enough for Taiko. He wants me 
to be dead permanently.” 

“Wait a minute,” said Forres- 
ter. “You got killed protecting 
me, right? Then you were frozen. 
But they’ve propped you up with 
this machine so you can be put 
on trial, because what you did 
was against the law?” 

“That’s right, Mr. Forrester.” 
“And now Taiko wants to kill 
you? I mean, really kill you?” 
“That’s right. When he’s fin- 
ished here he will leave and flood 
the whole installation. Maybe 
somebody will find me sooner or 
later, but not soon enough to 
help.” 

Forrester rocked back. “Why, 
that — ” He stopped. He simply 
did not know a word strong 
enough to apply. “And all be- 
cause you don’t agree with him 
about the Luddites?” 

“Because he’s crazy, Mr. For- 
rester,” whispered Tshumu. The 
breathy sound of the heart-lung 
machine changed its rhythm. 



“I'm sorry,” said Tshumu faitly, 
“but I’m about to pass out. You 
see, Mr. Forrester, it’s all up to 
you — now — ” 

And that was all. 

4 4\X7'ait a minute!” cried For- 
' ' rester. “Don’t leave me 
now! Tell me what to do!” 

But the eyes were closed, and 
the only sound was the whir 
and hiss of the machine. 

“My God!” whispered For- 
rester. If only there were some- 
thing he could do . 

And suddenly he knew there 
was. 

He did not wait to think about 
whether it was a good idea or 
not. He did not stop to contem- 
plate whether it would work or 
not. He turned his back on the 
man in the bed and marched 
back to the DR car. “Machine,” 
he cried. “I’m not allowed to die, 
right? If I were dead, you’d have 
me revived right away?” 

“Man Forrester,” said the tall, 
intellectual -looking robot that 
stood beside the car, “your arrest 
has been ordered. Would you like 
a precis of the charge against 
you?” 

“What I would like is an in- 
surance policy,” said Forrester 
tightly. “But I guess I’ll take a 
chance this one time without one. 
Let’s hope it’s only your speak- 
ing circuits that are all messed 
up!”

And he reached into the DR 
car and fumbled in the nest of 
first-aid equipment. What he 
wanted was easy to find; it was 
a scalpel, four inches long and 
razor sharp. 

“Machine, do your duty,” he 
cried, and with a rapid motion 
slit his throat. 

The pain was astonishing, but 
it lasted for only a moment. And 
then the world roared thinly at 
him, and slipped dizzyingly 
away.

CtT was dreaming,” murmured 
Forrester into the warm, 
comfortable darkness, “of com- 
mitting suicide. Funny! I want 
to live . .” 

“You’ll live. Chuck,” said a 
familiar voice. Forrester opened 
his eyes and gazed into the eyes 
of Hara. 

He thrust himself up. “Taiko!” 
he cried. “The Sirians! I’ve got 
to tell you — ” 

“You already told us, Chuck,” 
said Hara. “They’re taken care 
of. The Sirians are under lock 
and key, and Taiko’s under guard 
right now, telling a computer 
what he did so that they can 
undo it.” 

“Oh.” As though the words 
were a magic spell unleashing 
pain, Forrester felt a sudden 
pang at his throat, reached up 



and touched it and found it cov- 
ered with soft plastic film. He 
slumped back, looking at Hara’s 
patient, weary faoe. There was 
something he had to get straight 
with this man, he knew. Some- 
thing about Adne . and some- 
thing he had to get straight with 
Adne, too, if he ever saw her 
again. 

“The DR machines worked, 
then,” he said, remembering. 

“Brought you right here, with 
a priority order to patch you up 
and send you back. But as soon 
as you were patched you started 
talking, and they called me.” 
Hara sat down and put his hands 
on his knees. “You’re not too 
crazy about me, are you, Chuck? 
Adne said you resented the fact 
that I was the father of one of 
her kids.” 

“One of them?” Forrester cried. 
“My God, that woman’s — ” 

He stopped himself. It took an 
effort. After a moment he said, 
“I only hope I did the right 
thing. But maybe Taiko was 
right; this world is rotten clear 
through.” 

“Oh, we all are. Chuck,” said 
Hara easily. “Didn’t you know 
that? Everybody is, always. The 
whole history of the progress of 
the human race is the record of 
people trying to be better than 
they are.” 

“I don’t understand you,” said 
Forrester. Then; “But there’s a 



THE AGE OF THE PUSSYFOOT

lot I don’t understand. And I 
guess it’s important for the ma- 
chines to be going again, and the 
world warned, in case the Sirians 
attack.” 

“It’s important if they attack, 
sure. And twice as important if 
they don’t. Get some rest. 
Chuck,” said Hara, getting up. 
“And think about something, if 
you will. You can't go back. 
Don’t think the world made a 
wrong turning somewhere a cen- 
tury or a million years ago; 
there’s no such thing as a wrong 
turning.” 



He stopped in the doorway. 
“We’re going to start reviving 
people pretty soon,” he mention- 
ed. “Most of them were panick- 
ed, and they’ll be all right once 
they’re vital again. It ought to be 
Adne’s turn in about a week.” 
And he was gone, leaving For- 
rester to consider the next week, 
the next year, the next century — 
And, as it turned out, the next 
fifty millennia, in all of which he 
was alive, busy and well. Because 
he lived happily ever after, as 
did they all.

“Your $1,200.00 check arrived this morning by Special 
Delivery. Thanks ever so much for your telephone call and 
prompt payment. It still doesn't seem possible. It’s been a 
great thrill." 

That’s the way Emory Mead of Albany, N. Y., just one of 
our many big winners, reacted to receiving his cash prize. 
Dozens of men and women of all ages have cashed in as 
members of our exciting PUZZLE LOVERS CLUB, 

Our Club winners got their cash awards for solving 
puzzles in their leisure time. Our Club also has awarded 
huge prizes for many other kinds of contests. 



We've awarded cash in hundred-and-thousand-doliar units 
to retirees, sewing women, farmers, salesmen, war vet- 
erans, office workers, clerks, secretaries — people who 
never "before dreamed of having the kind of money that 
movie stars make. 

This announcement is an invitation to you, as a reader 
of this publication, to find out for yourself if you have the 
talent to win up to $70,000.00 in cash. If you are over 18 
and like to play word games of any kind, the information 
below may lead you to thousands of dollars in extra cash 
that you may use as you wish.
