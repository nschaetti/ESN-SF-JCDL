For a Festival of Science Fiction 



A s this issue appears, the city of 
Paris will he host to a large- 
iscale exposition of science fiction. 
Held at the Musetun of Decorative 
Arts on rue de Eivoli, created by 
Harold Szeeman, director of the 
Berne Kunsthalle, and produced with 
the prestigious aid of the^ louvre, 
this science-fiction exposition of 
some three thousand pieces of art, 
manuscripts, publications and other 
incxinabula covers everything from 
the Epic of Gilgamesh to the LEM, 
by way of Buck Rogers, The Skylark 
of Space and Ed Emshwiller (who 
painted the cover for its handsome 
program boxxjhure). 

Sounds like fun? We think so; and 
also fun, we thought, was the annual 
Festival Intemazionale del FUm di 
Fantascienza, held every July in the 
Italian city of Trieste; certainly a 
science-fiction film festival is a good 
idea, and the Triestinos do a splen- 
did job of organizing one .... 

But that's Europe. Question on 
our minds at this moment is. Why 
can't we have this sort of thing in 
the United States? 

G enerally speaking, this sort of 
thing is organized with the 
sponsorship of some large institution 
— the tourist bureau of a city; a 
university; a museum; an academy 
of arts or sciences. 

It seems to us that the United 
States is well endowed with all these 
things. It also seems to us that, 
since American science fiction is 
without much question the world 



leader by any standards you care 
to invoke — the best writers, the 
most publications, the best organized 
conventions and conferences, what- 
ever — we owe the whole world of 
science fiction, and incidentally our- 
selves, at least some serious con- 
sideration of having our own fes- 
tival. 

What it needs to get such a pro- 
ject off the ground is, say, the par- 
ticipation of a good-sized school We 
can think of any number that would 
be appropriate. There's M.I.T., with 
a highly active science-fiction fan 
club already on the premises (and 
anyway, living in a space-age, com- 
puterized environment that resem- 
bles science fiction to begin with). 
There's Syracuse University, already 
proudly maintaining the largest de- 
pository of science-fiction manu- 
scripts and pai>ers in the world. 
There's Louisiana State University, 
which last year did something like 
it, with its month-long festival of 
the Year 2000. There are in fact, at 
least a score of major schools all 
over the country which have the 
facilities and appear to have the 
interest. 

A week of showing of science-fic- 
tion films ... a gallery of science- 
fiction art . panel discussions 
amonlg science-fiction writers^ scien- 
tists and other useful and int^ested 
parties . special features od lib. 

Soimd like a good idea? Or would 
you rather go on having to cross 
the Atlantic for this sort of thing?

THE 



MAN 



by ROBERT SILVERBERG 




Illustrated 




He had fled Mankind because 
he had been destroyed in its 
service. Now if was time to 
i — and suffer — • againi 



M uller knew the maze quite well 
by this time. He understood its 
snares and its delusions, its pitfalls, 
its deadly traps. He had lived within 
it for nine years. 

He still moved warily. Three or 



four times already he had learned that 
his knowledge of the maze, while 
adequate and workable, was hot 
wholly complete. At least once he had 
come right to the edge of destruction, 
pulling back only by some improb- 
able bit of luck just before the unex- 
pected fountaining of an energy flare 



^ent a stream of raw power boiling 
across his path. Muller had charted 
that flare and fifty others; but as he 
moved through the city-sized laby- 
rinth he knew there was no guarantee 
he would not meet an uncharted one. 

Overhead the sky was darkening. 
The deep, rich green of late after- 
noon was giving way to the black of 
night. Muller paused a moment in his 
hunting to look at the pattern of the 
stars. Even that was becoming famil- 
iar now. He had chosen his own con- 
stellations on this desolate world, 
searching the heavens for arrange- 
ments of brightness that suited his pe- 
culiarly harsh, bitter taste. Now they 
appeared: the Dagger, the Back, the 
Shaft, the Ape, the Toad. In the 
forehead of the Ape flickered the 
small, grubby star that Muller be- 
lieved was the sun of Earth. He was 
not sure, because he had destroyed 
his chart tank after landing here on 
Lemnos; somehow, though, he felt that 
that minor flrebaU must be Sol. The 
same dim star formed the left eye of 
the Toad. There were times when 
Muller told himself that Sol would 
not be visible in the sky of this world 
ninety light-years from Earth, but at 
other times he was quite convinced. 
Beyond the Toad lay the constella- 
tion that Muller had named Libra, 
the Scales. 

Three small moons glittered here. 
The air was thin but breathable; Mul- 
ler had long ago ceased to notice that 
it hdd too much nitrogen, not enough 
oxygen. Gripping the butt of his gun 
tightly, he walked slowly through the 
alien city, searching for his dinner. 

He had six-months’ supply of food 
stored in a radiation locker half a 



kilometer away, but yet each night he 
went hunting so that he could replace 
at once whatever he drew from his 
cache. It was a way of devouring the 
time. And he needed that cache, unde- 
pleted, against the day wlm the 
maze might cripple or paralyze him. 
His keen eyes scanned the angled 
streets ahead. Above him rose the 
walls, screens, traps and confusions of 
the maze within which he lived He 
looked in all directions. The triple 
moonlight analyzed and dissected his 
shadow, splitting it into reduplicated 
images that danced and sprawled be- 
for him. 

The mass detector mounted over 
his left ear emitted a high-pitched 
sound. That told Muller that it had 
picked up the thermals of an animal 
in the 50-100 kilogram range. He had 
the detector programmed to scan in 
three horizons, of which this was the 
middle one, the food-beast range. It 
would also report to him on the prox- 
imity of 10-20 kilogram creatures — 
the teeth-beast range — and on the 
emanations of beasts over 500 kilo- 
grams — the big-beast range. The 
small ones had a way of going quick- 
ly for the throat, and the great ones 
were careless tramplers; Muller hunt- 
ed those in between and avoided the 
others. 

N ow he crouched, readying his 
weapon. His only concern in 
hunting was to strike from a secure, 
well-surveyed point so that in his con- 
centration on his prey he wouldn’t be 
victim to some more dangerous crea- 
ture. With the kickstaff mounted on 
the heel of his left boot he probed 
the wall behind him, making certain 

IF 



6 




that it would not open and engulf 
him. It was solid. Good. Muller edged 
himself backward until his back touch- 
ed the cool, polished stone. His left 
knee rested on the faintly yielding 
pavement. He sighted along the bar- 
rel of his gun. The mass detector 
continued to whine, indicating that 
the beast was remaining within a hun- 
dred-meter radius; the pitch rose 
slightly from moment to moment as 
the thermals grew stronger. 

Muller was in no hurry. He was at 
one side of a vast plaza bordered by 
glassy curving partitions, and any- 
thing that emerged from those gleam- 
ing crescents would be an easy shot. 
Muller was hunting tonight in Zone 
E of the maze, the fifth sector out 
from the heart, and one of the most 
dangerous. He rarely went past the 
relatively innocuous Zone D, but some 
daredevil mood had prodded him into 
E this evening. Since finding his way 
into the maze, he had never risked G 
or H again at all and had been as far 
out as F only twice. He came to E 
perhaps five times a year. 

To his right the converging lines 
of a shadow appeared jutting from 
one of the curving walls. The song of 
the mass detector reached into the 
upper end of the pitch spectrum for 
an animal of this size. The smallest 
moon, Atropos, swinging giddily 
through the sky, changed the shadow 
pattern; the hnes no longer con- 
verged, but now one bar of blackness 
cut across the other two. The shadow 
of a snout, Muller knew. An instant 
later he saw his victim. 

The animal was the size of a large 
dog, gray of muzzle and tawny of 
body, hump-shouldered, ugly, spec- 



tacularly carnivorous. For his first few 
years here Muller had avoided hunt- 
ing the carnivores, thinking that their 
meat would not be tasty. He had gone 
instead after the local equivalent of 
cows and sheep — mild-mannered 
ungulates that drifted blithely through 
the maze cropping the grasses in the 
garden places. Only when that bland 
meat palled did he go after one of the 
fanged, clawed creatures that har- 
vested the herbivores, and to his sur- 
prise their flesh was excellent Ho 
watched the animal emerge into the 
plaza. Its long snout twitched. Mul- 
ler could hear the sniffling sounds 
from where he crouched. 

Confidently, swaggeringly, the car- 
nivore strode across the sleek pave- 
ment of the plaza, its unretracted 
claws clicking and scraping. Muller 
fined his beam down to needle aper- 
ture and took thoughtful aim. The 
gun was proximity-responsive and 
would score a hit automatically, but 
Muller always keyed in the manual 
sighting. He and the gun had differ- 
ent goals. The gun was concerned 
with killing, Muller with eating; and 
it was easier to do his own aiming 
than to try to convince the weapon 
that a bolt through the tender, juicy 
hump would deprive him of the tasti- 
est cut. The gun, seeking the sim- 
plest target, would lance through 
that hump to the spine and bring 
the beast down, but Muller favored 
more finesse. 

He chose a target six inches for- 
ward from the hump: the place 
where the spine entered the skull. One 
shot did it. The animal toppled heav- 
ily. Muller went toward it as rapidly 
as he dared. Quickly he carved away 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE

the messentials — ^ limbs, head, belly 
— and sprayed a seal around the 
raw slab of flesh he cut from the 
hump. He sliced a hefty steak from 
the hin d q u a rters, too, and strapped 
both parcels to his Moulders. Then 
he swung around, searching for the 
zigzagging road that was the only safe 
entry to the core of the maze. In less 
than an hour he could be at his lair 
in the heart of Zone A. 

He was halfway across the plaza 
when he heard an unfamiliar sound. 

P ausing, he looked back. Three 
small loping creatures were head- 
ing toward ^ carcass he had aban- 
doned. But the scrabbling of the 
scavengers was not what he had 
heard. It had been the low rumbling 
sound overlaid by a hoarse throb in 
the middle frequmdes, too prdonged 
to be die roaring of one of the large 
animals. It was a sound Muller had 
not heard before. 

No: a sound he had not heard 
here before.. It registmd somewhere 
in his memory banks. That double 
boom, slowly dopplering into the dis- 
tance — = what was it? 

The sound had come from over 
his right shoulder, so it seemed. Mul- 
ler kxtod there and saw only the 
triple cascade of the maze’s secondary 
wall, rising in tier upon glittering am- 
ber tier. Above that wall? He saw the 
star-brightened sky: the Ape, the 
Toad, the Scales. 

Muller remembered the sound now. 
A ship; a starship, cutting out of 
warp onto ion drive to make a plan- 
etary landing. The boom of the ex- 
pel!^ the throb of the deceleraticm 
tubes, passing over the city. It was 



a sound he had not heard in nine 
years, since his own self-exile cm 
Lemnos had begun. So he was hav- 
ing visitors. Casual intruders, or had 
he been traced? What did they want? 
Anger blazed through him. He had 
had enough of them and their wcx'ld; 
why did they have to trouble him 
here? He wanted nothing to do with 
Earth or Earthmen. 

They would not reach him, he de- 
cided. 

They would die in the maze and 
their bones would join the million- 
year accumulation that lay strewn in 
the outer corridors. 

And if they succeeded in entering, 
as he had done — 

Well, then they would have to 
contend with him. Muller smiled 
grimly, adjusted the meat on his 
back, and returned his full concen- 
tration to the job of penetrating the 
maze. Soon he was within Tjoqq C, 
and safe. He reached his lair. He 
stowed his meat He prepared his din- 
ner. Pain hammered at his skull. 
After nine years he was no longer 
alone on this world. They had soiled 
his solitude. Once again, Muller felt 
betrayed. He wanted nothing more 
from Earth than privacy, now, and 
even that they would not give him. 
But they would suffer if they man- 
aged to reach him within the maze. 
If. 

II 

T he ship had erupted from warp a 
little late, almost in the outer 
fringes of Lemnos’ atmosphere. Char- 
les Boardman disliked that. He de- 
manded the highest possible stan- 

IP

dards of performance from himself, 
and he expected everyone about him 
to keep the same standards. Especial- 
ly pilots. 

Boardman thumbed the screen to 
life, and the cabin wall blossomed 
with a vivid image of the planet be- 
low. Scarcely any clouds swathed its 
surface; he had a clear view through 
the atmosphere. In the midst of a 
broad plain was a series of corruga- 
tions that even at a height of a hun- 
dred kilometers were sharply out- 
lined. Boardman turned to the young 
man beside him and said, “There you 
are, Ned. The labyrinth of Lemnos. 
And Dick Muller right in the middle 
of it!” 

Ned Rawlins pursed his lips. “So 
big? It must be hundreds of kilome- 
ters across!” 

“What you’re seeing is the outer 
embankment. The maze itself is sur- 
rounded by a concentric ring of 
earthen walls five meters high and 
nearly a thousand kilometers in outer 
circumference. But — ” 

“Yes, I know,” Rawlins burst in* 
“That dark spot within the outer 
walls — is that the city itself?” 
Boardman nodded. “That’s the in- 
ner maze. Twenty, thirty, kilome- 
ters in diameter, and God knows how 
many millions of years old. That’s 
where we’ll find Muller.” 

“If we can get inside.” 

**When we get inside.” 

“Yes. Yes. Of course. When we 
get inside,” Rawlins corrected, red- 
dening. He flashed a quick, earnest 
smile. “There’s no chance we won’t 
find the entrance, is there?” 

“Muller did,” said Boardman 
quietly. “He’s in there.” 



“But he’s the first who got inside. 
Everyone else who tried failed. So 
why will we — ”” 

“There weren’t many who tried,” 
Boardman said. “Those who did 
weren’t equipped for the problem. 
We’ll manage, Ned. We have to.” 
The ship swung toward the planet 
— going down much too rapidly, 
Boardman thought, oppressed by the 
strains of deceleration. He hated 
travel, and he hated the moment of 
landing worst of all. But this was a 
trip he could not have avoided. He 
eased back in the webfoam cradle 
and blanked out the screen. Ned 
Rawlins was still upright, eyes glow- 
ing with excitement. How wonder- 
ful to be young, Boardman thought. 
Certainly the boy was strong and 
healthy — and cleverer than he 
sometimes seemed. Boardman could 
not remember having been that sort 
of young man himself. He had the 
feeling of having always been on the 
brink of middle age — shrewd, calcu- 
lating, well organized. He was eighty, 
now, with almost half his lifetime be- 
hind him, and yet he could not bring 
himself to believe that his personality 
had changed in any essential way 
since he had turned twenty. He had 
learned techniques, the craft of man- 
aging men; he was wiser now; but 
he was not qualitatively different. 
Young Ned Rawline, though, was go- 
ing to be another person entirely six- 
ty-odd years from now, and very lit- 
tle of the callow boy in the next cra- 
dle would survive. Boardman suspect- 
ed, not happily, that this very mis- 
sion would be the crucible in which 
Ned’s innocence was blasted from 
him. 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



9 




B oardman closed his eyes as the 
ship entered its final landing 
maneuvers. He felt gravity clawing at 
his aging flesh. Down. Down. Down. 
How many planetfalls had he made, 
loathing every one? The diplomatic 
life was a restless one. Christmas on 
Mars, Easter on one of the Centaur- 
ine worlds, the midyear feast cele- 
brated on a stinking planet of Rigel, 
and now this trip, the most complex 
of all. Man was not made to flash 
from star to star like this, Boardman 
thought. I have lost my sense of a 
universe. They say this is the richest 
era of human existence; but I think 
a man can be richer in knowing ev- 
ery atom of a single golden island in 
a blue sea than by spending his days 
striding among all the worlds. 

There were heavy fleshy jowls 
about his throat, and pockets of ex- 
tra meat here and there about his 
body, giving him a soft, pampered 
look. At little effort Boardman could 
have had himself streamlined to the 
fashionably sleek appearance of a 
modern man; this was an era when 
men a century and a quarter old 
could look like striplings, if they 
cared to. Early in his career Board- 
man had chosen to simulate authentic 
aging. Call it an investment; what he 
forfeited in chic he gained in status. 
His business was selling advice to 
governments, and governments pre- 
ferred not to buy counsel from men 
who looked like boys. Boardmen had 
looked fifty-five years old for the last 
forty years, and he expected to retain 
that look of strong, vigorous early 
middle age at least another half a 
century. Later, he would allow time to 
work on him again when he entered 



the final phase of his career. He 
would take oh the whitened hair and 
shrunken cheek of a man of eighty, 
and pose as Nestor rather than as 
Ulysses. At the moment it was pro- 
fessionally useful to look only slight- 
ly out of trim, as he did. 

He was a short man, though he 
was so stocky that he easily domin- 
ated any group at a conference table. 
His powerful shoulders, deep chest, 
and long arms would have been better 
suited to a giant; when he stood up 
Boardman revealed himself as of less 
than middle height, but sitting down 
he was awesome. He found that fea- 
ture useful too and had never con- 
sidered altering it. An extremely tall 
man is better suited to command 
than to advise, and Boardman had 
never had the wish to command; he 
preferred a more subtle exercise of 
power. But a short man who looks big 
at a table can control empires. The 
business of empires is transacted sit- 
ting down. 

He had the look of authority. His 
chin was strong, his nose thick and 
blunt and forceful, his lips both firm 
and sensuous, his eyebrows immense 
and shaggy, black strips of fur sprout- 
ing from a massive forehead that 
might have awed a Neanderthal. He 
wore his hair long and coarse. Three 
rings gleamed on his fingers, one a 
gyroscope of platinum and rubies with 
duU-hued inlays of U-238. His taste 
in clothing was severe and conserva- 
tive, running to heavy fabrics and al- 
most medieval cuts, fii another epoch 
he mi^t have been well cast as a 
worldly cardinal or as an ambitious 
prime minister; he would have been 
important in any court at any time.

He was important now. The price of 
Boardman’s importance, though, was 
the turmoil of travel Soon he would 
land on another strange planet, where 
the air would smell wrong, the grav- 
ity would be a shade too strong and 
the sun’s hue would not be right. 
Boardman scowled. 

He looked at Ned Rawlins. Twen- 
ty-two, twenty-three years old, some- 
thing like that: the picture of naive 
young manhood, although Boardman 
knew that Ned was old enough to 
have learned more than he seemed 
to show. Tall, conveniently hand- 
some without the aid of cosmetic 
surgery; fair hair, blue eyes, wide, 
mobile lips, flawless teeth. He was 
the son of a communications theorist, 
now dead, who had been one of 
Richard Muller’s closest friends. 
Boardman was counting on that con- 
nection to carry them a good distance 
in the delicate transactions ahead. 

“The landing seems so slow, doesn’t 
it?” Rawline asked. 

“Another minute now,” Boardman 
said. The boy’s face looked scarcely 
stretched by the forces acting upon 
them. His left cheek was drawn down 
slightly, that was all. It was weird to 
see the semblance of a sneer on that 
shining visage. 

“Here we come now,” Boardman 
muttered and closed his eyes again. 
The ship closed the last gap between 
itself and the ground. The expellers 
cut out; the deceleration tubes snarled 
their last. There was the final awk- 
ward moment of uncertainty, then 
steadiness, the landing jacks gripping 
firmly, the roar of landing silenced. 
We are here, Boardman thought. Now 
for the maze. Now for Mr. Richard 



Muller. Now to see if he’s become any 
less horrible in the past nine years. 
Maybe he’s just like everyone el^, by 
now. If he is, Boardman told himself, 
God help us all. 

Ill 

W ithin the maze MuHcr contem- 
plated his options. In the milky 
green recesses of the viewing tank he 
could see the ship and the plastic 
domes that had sprouted beside it 
and the tiny figures of men moving 
about. He wished now that he had 
been able to find the fine control of 
the viewing tank; the images he re- 
ceived were badly out of focus. But 
he considered himself lucky to have 
the use of the tank at all. Many of 
the ancient instruments in this city 
had become useless long ago through 
the decay of some vital part. A sur- 
prising number had endured the eons 
unharmed, a tribute to the technical 
skill of their makers; but of these, 
Muller had been able to discover the 
function of only a few, and he oper- 
ated those imperfectly. 

He watched the blurred figures of 
his fellow humans working busily 
and wondered what new torment they 
were preparing for him. 

He bad tried to leave no clues to 
his whereabouts when he fled from 
Earth. He had come here in a rented 
ship, filing a deceptive flight plan by 
way of Sigma Draconis. During his 
warp trip, of course, he had had to 
pass six mmiitor stations, but he had 
given each one a misleading simu- 
lated great-circle galactic route rec- 
ord. A routine comparison check of 
all the monitor stations would reveal 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



11 




th^t Muller’s successive announce- 
ments of location added up to non- 
sense^ but he had gambled that he 
would manage to complete his flight 
and vanish before they ran one of 
the regular checks. Evidently he had 
won that gamble, for no interceptor 
ships had come after him. 

Emerging from warp in the vicinity 
of I^mnos, he had carried out one 
final evasive maneuver by leaving 
his ship in a parking orbit and de- 
scending by drop-capsule. A disrupter 
bomb, pre-programmed, had blasted 
the ship to molecules and sent the 
fragments traveling on a billion con- 
flicting orbits through the universe; it 
would take a fancy computer indeed 
to ..calculate a probable nexus of 
source for those! The bomb was de- 
signed to provide fifty false vectors 
per.square meter of explosion surface, 
a .virtual guarantee that no tracer 
could possibly be effective within a 
finite span of time. Muller needed 
only a very short finite span — say, 
sixty years. Sixty years of solitude 
and a peaceful, private death, that 
was all he asked. 

Had they really traced him? 

Muller decided that they had not. 
Thqy had no motive for following 
him. He was no fugitive who had to 
be brought back to justice. He was 
simply a man with a loathsome af- 
fliction, an abomination in the sight 
of his fellow mortals, and doubtless 
Earth felt itself well rid of him. The 
kindest thing he could do for his own 
kind was to remove himself from 
their midst, and he had done that as 
thoroughly as he could. They would 
hardly make an effort to come look- 
ing .for someone so odious to them. 



Who were these intruders, then? 

Archeologists, he suspected. The 
ruined city of Lemnos still held a 
magnetic, fatal fascination for them, 
for everyone. Muller had hoped that 
the risks of the maze would continue 
to keep men away. It had been dis- 
covered over a century earlier, but 
before his arrival there had been a 
period of many years in which Lem- 
nos was shunned. For good reason: 
Miller had many times seen the 
corpses of those who had tried and 
failed to enter the maze. 

S nugly established at the core of the 
maze, he had command of 
enough sensing devices to follow, 
however vaguely, the progress of any 
living creatures outside. Thus he 
could trace the wanderings from zone 
to zone of the animals that were his 
prey and also those of the great 
beasts who offered danger. To a lim- 
ited degree he could control the snares 
of the maze, which were normally 
nothing more than passive traps, but 
which could be employed aggressive- 
ly, under the right conditions against, 
some enemy. He asked himself if he 
would use those defenses against hu- 
man beings if they penetrated that 
far and had no answer. He did not 
really hate his own species. He just 
preferred to be left alone, in what 
passed for peace. 

He eyed the screens. He occupied 
a squat hexagonal cell, apparently one 
of the housing units in the inner 
dty, equipped with a wall of view- 
ing tanks. It had taken him more 
than a year to find out which parts 
of the maze corresponded to the im- 
ages on the screens; but by patiently 

IF 



12 




posting markers he had matched the 
dim images to the glossy reality. The 
six lowest screens along the wall 
showed him pictures of areas in Zones 
A through F; the cameras, or what- 
ever they were, swivded through 180 - 
de^ee arcs, enabling the hidden mys- 
terious eyes to patrol the entire re- 
gion around each of the zone en- 
trances. Since only one entrance pro- 
vided safe access to the zone wiAin, 
all others being lethal, the screens ef- 
fectively allowed Muller to watch the 
inward progress of any prowler. It 
did not matter what was taking place 
at any of the false entrances. Those 
who persisted there would die. 

Screens seven through ten, in the 
upper bank, relayed images that ap- 
parently came from Zones G and H, 
the outermost, largest, and deadliest 
zones of the maze. Muller had not 
wanted to go to the trouble of re- 
turning to those zones to check his 
theory in detail; he was satisfied that 
the screens were pickups from points 
in the outer zones, and it was not 
worth risking those zones again to 
find out more accurately where the 
pickups were mounted. As for the 
eleventh and twelfth screens, they ob- 
viously showed views of the plain 
outside the maze altogether — the 
plain now occupied by a newly ar- 
rived starship from Earth. 

Few of the other devices left him 
by the ancient builders of the maze 
were as informative. Moimted on a 
dais in the center of the city’s cen- 
tral plaza, shielded by a crystal vault, 
was a twelve-sided stone the color of 
ruby, in whose depths a medianism 
like an intricate shutter ticked and 
pulsed. 



He suspected some sort of clock, 
keyed to a nuclear oscillation, sound- 
ing out the units of tin^ its m^er em- 
ployed. Periodically the stone under- 
went temporary changes: its face 
turned cloudy, deepened in hue to 
blue or even black, swung on its 
mounting. Muller’s careful record- 
keeping had not yet told the meaning 
of changes. He could not even anal- 
yze the periodicity. The metamorpho- 
ses were not random, but the pattern 
they followed was beyond his ken. 

At the eight corners of the plaza 
were metallic spikes, smoothly taper- 
ing to heights of some twenty feet. 
Throughout the cycle of the year 
these spikes revolved, so they were 
calendars, it seemed, moving on hid- 
den bearings. Muller knew that they 
made one complete revolution in each 
thirty-month turning of Lemnos 
about its somber orange primary, but 
he suspected some deeper purpose for 
these gleaming pylons. Searching for 
it occupied much of his time. 

Spaced neatly in the streets of Zone 
A were cages whose bars were hewn 
from an alabaster-like rock. Muller 
saw no way of opening these cages; 
yet twice during his years here he had 
awakened to find the bars withdrawn 
into the stone pavement and the cages 
gaping wide. The first time they had 
remained open for three days, and 
then the bars had returned to their 
positions while he slept, sliding into 
place and showing no seam where 
they could have parted. When the 
cages opened again, a few years lat», 
Muller watched them constantly to 
rind the secret of their mechanism. 
But on the fourth night he dozed just 
long enou^ to miss closing again. 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



13 




Equally mysterious was the aque- 
duct. Around the length of Zone B 
ran a closed trough, perhaps of onyx, 
with angular spigots placed at fifty- 
meter intervals. When any sort of 
vessel, even a cupped hand, was 
placed beneath a spigot, it yielded 
pure water. But when he had at- 
t^pted to poke a finger into one 
of the spigots he found no opening. 
Nor could he see any, even while the 
water was coming forth; It was as 
though the fluid issued through a 
permeat)le plug of stone, and Muller 
found it hard to accept that. He wel- 
comed the water, though. 

I t surprised him that so much of the 
, city should have survived. Ar- 
cl^eologists had concluded, from a 
stu4y . of the artifacts and skeletons 
fou!n,d, , on Lemnos outside the maze, 
that, there had been no intelligent life 
here for upward of a million years. 
Yet most of the city, supposedly built 
before the evolution of mankind on 
Earth, looked untouched by the ages. 
Thp ,4ry weather could account in 
part for that; there were no storms 
here, and rain had not fallen since 
Muller’s arrival. But wind and wind- 
blown sand could carve walls and 
pavements over a million years, and 
there was no sign of such carving 
here. Nor had sand accumulated in 
thei open streets of the city. Muller 
knew why. Hidden pumps collected 
all d^ris, keeping everting spot- 
less^ He had gathered handfuls of 
soil from the garden plots, scattering 
little - trails here and there. Within 
minutes the driblets of soil had begun 
to. slither across the polished pave- 
meuit, vanishing into slots that open- 



ed briefly and closed again at the in- 
tersection of buildings and ground. 

Evidently beneath the city lay a 
network of inconceivable machinery 
— imperishable caretaker devices 
that guarded the city against the tooth 
of time. Muller had not been able 
to reach that network, though. With 
improvised tools he had begun to dig 
in the garden areas, hoping to reach 
the subcity that way, but though he 
had driven one pit more than a dozen 
feet and another even deeper, he had 
come upon no signs of anything be- 
low but more soil. The hidden guar- 
dians had to be there, however: the 
instruments that operated the view- 
ing tanks, swept the streets, repaired 
the masonry, and controlled the mur- 
derous traps that studded the outer 
zones of the labyrinth. 

It was hard to imagine a race that 
could build a city of this sort — a 
city designed to last millions of years. 
It was harder still to imagine how 
they could have vanished. Assuming 
that the fossils found in the burial 
yard outside the walls were those of 
the builders — not necessarily a safe 
assumption — this city had been put 
together by burly humanoids, a meter 
and a half t^l, immensely thick 
through the chest and shoulders, with 
long cunning fingers, eight to the 
hand, and short double-jointed legs. 
They were gone from the known 
worlds of the universe, and nothing 
like them had been found in any 
other system; perhaps they had with- 
drawn to some far galaxy yet unvisit- 
ed by man, or possibly they had been 
a non-spacegoing race that evolved 
and perished right here on Lenmos, 
leaving this city as their monument.

The rest of the planet was with- 
out trace of habitation. 

H ad the builders of the maze 
been slaughtered in their own 
sleek streets, and had the mechanical 
wardens swept the bones away? No 
way of knowing. They were gone. 
Muller, entering their city, had found 
it silent, desolate, as if it had never 
sheltered life, an automatic city, ster- 
ile, flawless. Only beasts occupied it. 
They had had a million years to find 
their way through the maze and take 
possession. Muller had counted some 
two dozen species- of mammals, in all 
sizes from rat-equivalent to elephant- 
equivalent; there were grazers who 
munched on the city’s gardens and 
hunters who fed on the herbivores. 
The ecological balance seemed per- 
fect. 

The city was his now. 

There had been others who had 
come here, and not all of them had 
been human. Entering the maze, Mul- 
ler had been treated to the sight of 
those who had failed to go the route. 
He had sighted a score of human 
skeletons in Zones H, G, and F. 
Three men had made it to E, and 
one to D. Muller had expected to 
see men’s bones; what took him off 
guard was the collection of alien 
bones. In H and G he had seen the 
remains of great dragon-like crea- 
tures, still clad in the shreds of 
spacesuits. Some day curiosity might 
triumph over fear and he might go 
back for a second look. Closer to the 
core lay an assortment of life-forms, 
mostly humanoid but veering from 
the standard structure. How long ago 
they had come here Muller could not 

THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



guess; even in this dry climate, would 
exposed skeletons last more than a 
few centuries? The galactic litto was 
a sobering reminder of something 
Muller already adequately knew; that 
despite the experience of man’s first 
two centuries of extrasolar travel, in 
which no living intelligent alien race 
was encountered, the universe was 
full of other forms of life, and so<mer 
or later man would meet them. The 
boneyard on Lemnos contained relics 
of at least a dozen different races — - 
maybe more. 

The inconsistency of finding the 
litter of bones within the maze did 
not strike him for several years. The 
mechanisms of the city, he knew, 
cleaned relentlessly, tidying up ev- 
erything from particles of dust to 
the bones of the animals on whom 
he fed. Yet the skeletons of would- 
be invaders of the maze were allowed 
to remain where they lay. Why cart 
away the corpse of a dead elephant- 
like beast that had blundered into 
a power snare, while leaving the 
remains of a dead dragon killed by 
the same snare? Because the dragon 
wore protective clothing, and so was 
sapient? Sapient corpses were delib- 
erately allowed to remain, Muller re- 
alized. 

As warnings. ABANDON ALL 
HOPE, YE WHO ENTER HERE. 

Those skeletons were part of the 
psychological warfare waged against 
all intruders by this mindless, death- 
less, diabolical city. They were re- 
minders of the perils that lurked ev- 
erywhere. How the guardian drew 
the subtle distinction between bodies 
that should be left in situ and those 
that should be swept away, Muller

(Jid .not know; but he was convinced 
.that the distinction was real. 

, watched his screens. He eyed 
the tiny figures moving about the 
ship on the plain. 

. Let them come in, he thought. The 
city hasn’t had a victim in years. It’ll 
t^e. care of them. I’m safe where I 
am. 

And, he knew, if by some miracle 
tliey managed to reach him, they 
^\yould not remain long. His own spe- 
cial malady would drive them away. 
They might be clever enough to de- 
feat the maze; but they could not 
endure the affliction that made Rich- 
^d Muller intolerable to his own 
species. 

“Go away,” Muller said aloud. 

He heard the whirr of rotors and 
stepped from his dwelling to see a 
dark shadow traverse the plaza. They 
were scouting the maze from the 
air. Quickly he went indoors. Then 
he smiled at his own impulse to hide. 
They could detect him, of course, 
wherever he was. Their screens would 
jteJ^l them that a human being inhab- 
ited the labyrinth. And then, natural- 
ly, they would try to make contact 
with him, though unaware of his 
identity. After that — 

Muller stiffened as a sudden over- 
whelming desire blazed through him. 
To have them come to him. To talk 
to men again. To break his isolation. 

He wanted them here. 

Only for an instant. After the mo- 
mentary breakthrough of loneliness 
came the return to rationality, the 
ctiiiling awareness of what it would 
'be like to face his kind again. No, he 
thought. Keep out! Or die in the 
maze. Keep out. Keep out. Keep out. 



4 i n ight down there,” Boardman 

-IV said. “That’s where he must 
be, eh, Ned? You can see the glow 
on the face of the tank. We^re picking 
up the right mass, the right density, 
the right everything. One live man, 
and it’s got to be Muller.” 

“At the heart of the maze,” said 
Rawlins. “So he really did it!” 

“Somehow.” Boardman peered into 
the viewing tank. From a height of a 
couple of kilometers the structure 
of the inner city was clear. He could 
make out eight distinct zones, each 
with its characteristic style of archi- 
tecture, its plazas and promenades, 
its angling walls, its tangle of streets 
swirling in dizzyingly alien patterns. 
The zones were concentric, fanning 
out from a broad plaza at the heart 
of it all, and the scoutplane’s mass 
detector had located Muller in a row 
of low buildings just to the east of 
the plaza. What Boardman failed to 
make out was any obvious passage 
linking zone to zone. There was no 
shortage of blind alleys, but even 
from the air the true route was not 
apparent; what was it like trying to 
work inward on the ground? 

It was all but impossible. Board- 
man knew. The master data banks in 
the ship held the account of those 
early explorers who had tried it and 
failed. Boardman had brought with 
him every scrap of information on the 
penetration of the maze, and none of 
it was very encouraging except the 
one puzzling but incontrovertible da- 
tum that Richard Muller had managed 
to get inside. 

Rawlins said. “This is going to

16 




sound naive^ I know, Charles. But 
why don’t we just come down from 
here and land the scoutplane hi the 
middle of that central plaza? 

“I’ll show you,” said Boardman. 

He spoke a command. A robot 
drone probe detached itself from the 
belly of the plane and streaked across 
toward the city, Boardman and Raw- 
lins followed the blunt gray metal 
projectile until it was only a few score 
meters above the tons of the build- 
ings. Through its faceted eye they had 
a sharp view of the city, revealing 
the intricate texture of much of the 
stonework. Suddenly the drone probe 
vanished. There was a burst of in- 
candescence, a puff of greenish smoke 
— and then nothing at all. 

Boardman nodded. “There’s still a 
protective field over the whole thing. 
It volatilizes anything that tries to get 
through.” 

“So even a bird that comes too 
close — ” 

There are no birds on Lemnos.” 

“Raindrops, then. Whatever falls 
on the city — ” 

“Lemnos gets no rain,” said 
Boardman sourly. ”At least not on 
this continent. The only thing that 
field keeps out is strangers. We’ve 
known it since the first expedition. 
Some brave men found out about 
that field the hard way.” 

“Didn’t they try a drone probe 
first?” 

Smiling, Boardman said, “When 
you find a dead city sitting in the 
middle of a desert on a dead world, 
you don’t expect to be blown up if 
you land inside it. It’s a forgiveable 
sort of mistake. Except that Lemnos 
doesn’t forgive mistakes.” He ges- 



tured, and the plane dropped lower, 
following the orbit of the outer walh 
for a moment. Then it rose and hov- 
ered over the heart of the city. The 
wrong-colored sunlight glistened off 
a hall of mirrors. They overflew the 
city again and again, marking off a 
preprogrammed observation pattern. 

C aptain Hosteen came aft to pay 
his respects, a short, duck- 
framed man with a flat nose and 
coppery skin. He was a good m a n y 
Boardman knew, and ready to sac- 
rifice a^ score of lives, including his 
own, to get into that maze. 

Hosteen flicked a glance from the 
screen to Boardman’s face and said, 
“Learning anything?” 

“Nothing new. We have a job.” 
“Want to go down again?” 
“Might as well,” Boardman said. 
He looked at Rawlins. “Unless you 
have anything else you’d like to cbedE, 
Ned.” 

“Me? Oh, no — no, that is — 
well, I wonder if we need to go kito 
the maze at all. I mean, if we COidd 
lure Muller out somehow, talk to 
him outside the city — ” 

“No.” 

“Wouldn’t it work?” 

“No,” said Boardman emphatic^d- 
ly. “Item one, Muller wouldn’t come 
out if we asked him. He’s a misan- 
thrope, remember? He buried him- 
self here to get away from humanity. 
Why should he socialize with us? 
Item two, we couldn’t invite him out- 
side without letting him know too 
much of what we want from him. In 
this deal, Ned, we need to hoard our 
resources of strategy, not toss them 
away in our first move.” 



THE MAN IN THE AAAZE 



17 




“I don’t understand what you 
mean.” 

Patiently Boardman said, “Suppose 
we used your approach. What would 
you say to Muller to make him come 
out?” 

“Why, that we’re here from Earth 
to ask him if he’ll help us in a time 
of system-wide crisis. That we’ve en- 
countered a race of alien beings with 
whom we’re unable to communicate, 
and that it’s absolutely necessary that 
we break through to them in a hurry, 
and that he alone can do the trick. 
We — ” Rawlins stopped. Color 
mounted in his cheeks. He said in a 
hoarse voice, “Muller isn’t going to 
give a damn for those arguments, is 
he?” 

“No, Ned. Earth sent him a bunch 
of aliens once before. And they 
ruined him.” 

V 

T hey had come equipped for solv- 
ing the problem of the maze. 
The ship’s brain, of course, was a 
first-class computer, and it carried 
the details of all previous Earth-based 
attempts to enter the city. Except 
one, of course, and unfortunately that 
had been the only successful one. 
But records of past failures have 
their uses. The ship’s data banks had 
plenty of mobile extensions: air- 
borne and groundborne drone probes, 
spy-eyes, sensor batteries and more. 
Before any human life was risked on 
the maze Boardman and Hosteen 
would try the whole niechanical ar- 
ray. Mechanicals were expendable, 
anyway; the ship carried a set of tem- 
plates, and it would be no trouble to 

18 



replicate all devices destroyed. But a 
point would come at which the drone 
probes had to give way to men. The 
aim was to gather as much informa- 
tion as possible for those men to use. 

Never before had anyone tried to 
crack the maze this way. The early 
explorers had simply gone walking 
in, unsuspecting, and had perished; 
Their successors had known enough 
of the story to avoid the more ob- 
vious traps and had been aided to 
some extent by sophisticated sen- 
sory devices, but this was the first 
attempt to run a detailed survey be- 
fore entering. 

The overflights on the first day 
had given everybody a good visual 
image of the maze. Strictly speaking, 
it hadn’t been necessary for them to 
leave the ground; they could have 
watched big-screen relays from the 
comfort of their camp and gained a 
decent idea of the conformation be- 
low, letting airborne probes do all 
the work. But Boardman had insisted. 
The mind registers things one way 
when it picks them off a relay 
screen and another when the sen- 
sory impressions are flooding in 
straight from the source. Now all of 
them had seen the city from the air 
and had seen what the guardians of 
the maze could do to a drone probe 
that ventured into the protective field 
overlying the city. 

Rawlins had suggested the possi- 
bility that there might be a null spot 
in Aat protective field. Toward late 
afternoon they checked it out by load- 
ing a probe with metal pellets and 
stationing it fifty meters above the 
highest point of the maze. Scanner 
eyes recorded the action as the drone 



IF 




slowly turned, spewing the pellets 
one at a time into preselected one- 
square-meter boxes above the city. 
Each in turn was incinerated as it 
fell. They were able to calculate that 
the thickness of the safety field va- 
ried with distance from the center of 
the maze; it was only about two 
meters deep above the inner zones, 
much deeper at the outer rim, form- 
ing an invisible cup over the city. 
But there were no null spots; the 
field was capable of overstrain by 
having the probe reloaded with pel- 
lets that were catapulted simultane- 
ously into each of the test rectan^es. 
The field dealt with them all, creat- 
ing for a moment a single pucker of 
flame above the city. 

At the expense of a few mole 
probes they found out that reaching 
the city through a tunnel was equally 
impossible. The moles burrowed into 
the coarse sandy soil outside the out- 
er walls, chewed themselves passage- 
ways fifty meters down, nosed up- 
ward again when they were beneath 
the maze. They were destroyed by 
the safety field while still twenty me- 
ters below ground level. A ^ at 
burrowing in right at the base of the 
embankments also failed; the field 
went straight down, apparently, all 
around the city. 

A power technician offered to rig 
an interference pylon to drain the 
energy of the field. It didn’t work. 
The pylon, a hundred meters tall, 
sucked in power from all over the 
planet, and blue lightning leaped and 
hissed along its accumulator bank, 
but it had no effect on the safety 
field. They reversed the plyon and 
sent a million kilowatts shoot- 



ing into the city, hoping to short the 
field. The field drank everything and 
and seemed ready for more. No one 
had any rational theory to explain 
the field’s power source. “It must tap 
the planet’s own energy of rotation,” 
the technician who had rigged the 
pylon said, and then, realizing he 
hadn’t contributed anything useful, he 
looked away and began to snap or- 
ders into the handmikes he carried. 

Three days of similar researches 
demonstrated that the city was in- 
vulnerable to intrusion from above or 
below. 

44^^here’s only one way in,” said 
A Hosteen. “That’s on foot, 
through the main gate.” 

“If the people in the city really 
wanted to be safe,” Rawlins asked, 
“why did they leave even a gate 
open?” 

“Maybe they wanted to go in and 
out themselves, Ned.” said Board- 
man quietly. “Or maybe they wanted 
to give invaders a sporting chance. 
Hosteen, shall we send some probes 
inside?” 

The morning was gray. Clouds the 
color of wood smoke stained the sky; 
it looked almost as if rain were on 
the way. A harsh wind knifed the 
soil from the plain and sent it slicing 
into their faces. Behind the veil of 
clouds lay the sun, a flat orange disk 
that seemed only slightly larger than 
Sol as seen from Earth, though it 
was less than half as distant. Lem- 
nos’s sun was a gloomy M dwarf, 
cool and weary, an old star circled 
by a dozen old planets. Lemnos, the 
innermost, was the only one that had 
ever sustained life; the others were 



THE AAAN IN THE MAZE 



19 




frigid and dead, beyond the range 
of the sun’s feeble rays, frozen from 
core to atmosphere. 

Ned Rawlins felt a chill at his 
heart as be stood beside the data 
terminal a thousand meters from the 
outer embankment of the maze, 
watching his shipmates marshalling 
their probes and instruments. He 
wondered how anyone as gifted, as 
full of life and energy and human 
warmth as Dick Muller, could ever 
have been willing to maroon him- 
seuf inside that dismal maze. 

Then he remembered what had , 
happened to Muller on Beta Hydri 
IV and conceded that even a man 
like Muller might well have good 
reasons for coming to rest here. Lem- 
nos offered the perfect escape: an 
Earthlike world, uninhabited, where 
he was almost guaranteed the free- 





dom from human company. And 
we’re here to flush him out and drag 
him away. Rawlins scowled. Dirty 
dirty dirty, he thought, "ae old thing 
about the ends and the means. Across 
the way, Rawlins could see the blocky 
figure of Charles Boardman standing 
in front of the big data terminal, wav- 
ing his arms this way and that to 
direct the men fanning out near the 
walls of the city. He began to under- 
stand that he had let Boardman 
dragoon him into a nasty adventure. 
The glib old devil hadn’t gone into 
details, back on Earth, about the ex- 
act methods by which they were 
goings to win Muller’s cooperation. 
Boardman had made it sound like 
some kind of shining crusade. In- 
stead it was going to be a dirty trick. 
Boardman never went into the details 
of anything before he had to, Raw- 



lins was coming to see. Rule one: 
hoard your resources of strategy. Nev- 
er tip your hand. And so here I am, 
part of the conspiracy. 

Hosteen and Boardman had de- 
ployed a dozen drones at the various 
entrances to the inner part of the 
maze. It was already clear that the 
only safe way into the city was 
through the northeast gate, but they 
had drones to spare and they wanted 
all the data they could gather. The 
terminal Rawlins was watching flash- 
ed a partial diagram of the maze on 
the screen — the section immediately 
in front of him — and gave him a 
good long time to study its loops and 
twists. It was his special responsibility 
to follow the progress of the drone 
through this sector. Each of the 
other drones was being monitored 
both by computer and by human ob- 
server, while Boardman and Hosteen 
were at the master terminal watch- 
ing the progress of the entire oper- 
ation all at once. 

“Send them in,” Boardman said. 

H osteen gave the command and 
the drones rolled forward 
through the city’s gates. Looking now 
through the eyes of the squat mobile 
probe, Rawlins got his first view of 
what lay in Zone H of the maze. He 
saw a scalloped wall of what looked 
like puckered blue porcelain undu- 
lating away to the left and a barrier 
of metallic threads dangling from a 
thick stone slab to the other side. The 
drone skirted the threads, which tin- 
kled and quivered in delicate response 
to the disturbance of thin air; it 
moved to the base of the porcelain 
wall and followed it at an inward- 




THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



21 




sloping angle for perhaps twenty me- 
ters. There the wall curved abruptly 
back on itself, for min g a sort of 
chamber open at the top. The last 
time anyone had entered the maze 
this way — on the fourth expedition 
— the two men had passed that open 
chamber; one had remained outside 
and was destroyed, the other had gone 
inside and was spared. The drone en- 
tered the chamber. A moment later 
a beam of pure red light lanced from 
the center of a mosaic decoration 
on the wall and swept over the area 
immediately outside the chamber. 

Boardman’s voice came to Rawlins 
through the speaker taped to his ear. 
“We lost fpur of the probes the 
moment they went through their 
gates. That’s exactly as expected. 
How’s yours doing?” 

“Following the plan,” said Raw- 
lins. “So far it’s okay.” 

“You ought to lose it within six 
miilutes of entry. What’s your 
elapsed time now?” 

“Two minutes fifteen.” 

The drone was out of the chamber 
now and shuttling quickly through 
the place where the lightbeam had 
flashed. Rawlins keyed in olfactory 
and got the smell of scorched air, lots 
of ozone. The path divided ahead. 
To one side was a single-span bridge 
of stone arching over what looked like 
a pit of flame; to the other was a 
jumbled pile of cyclopean blocks 
resting precariously edge to edge. The 
bridge seemed far more inviting, but 
the drone immediately turned away 
from it and began to pick its way 
over the jumbled blocks. Rawlins 
asked it why, and it relayed the in- 
formation that the “bridge” wasn’t 



there at all; it was a projection beam- 
ed from scanners mounted beneath 
the facing piers. Requesting a simu- 
lation of an approach anyway, Raw- 
lins got a picture of the probe walk- 
ing out onto the pier and stepping 
unsuspectingly through the solid- 
looking bridge to lose its balance; 
and as the simulated probe strug^ed 
to regain its equilibrium, the pier 
tipped forward and shucked it into 
the fiery pit. 

Meanwhile the real probe had 
clambered over the blocks and was 
coming down the other side, un- 
harmed. Three minutes and eight sec- 
onds had gone by. A stretch of 
straight road here turned out to be as 
safe as it looked. It was flanked on 
both sides by windowless towers a 
hundred meters high, made of some 
iridescent mineral, sleek and oily-sur- 
faced, that flashed shimmering naoire 
patterns as the drone hurried along. 
At the beginning of the fourth min- 
ute the probe skirted a bright grill- 
work like interlocking teeth aitfl side- 
stepped an umbrella-shaped piledriver 
that descended with crushing force. 
Eighty seconds later it stepped around 
a tilt-block that opened into a yawn- 
ing abyss, deftly eluded a quintet of 
blades that sheared upward out of 
the pavement, and emerged onto a 
sliding walkway that carried it quick- 
ly forward for exactly forty seconds 
more. 

All this had been traversed long 
ago by a Terran explorer named 
Cartissant, since deceased. He had 
dictated a detailed record of his ex- 
periences within the maze. He had 
lasted five minutes and thirty sec- 
onds, and his mistake had come in

IF 




not getting off the walkway by the 
forty-first second. Those who had 
been monitoring him outside, back 
then, could not say what had hap- 
pened to him after that. As his drone 
left the walkway, Rawlins asked for 
another simulation and saw a quick 
dramatization of the computer’s best 
guess: the walkway opened to engulf 
its passenger at that point. The probe, 
meanwhile, was going swiftly toward 
what looked like the exit from this 
outermost zone of the maze. Beyond 
lay a well lit, cheerful-looking plaza 
ringed with drifting blobs of a pearly 
glowing substance. 

Rawlins said, “I’m into the seventh 
minute, and we’re still going, Charles. 
There seems to be a door into Zone 
G just ahead. Maybe you ought to 
cut in and monitor my screen.” 

“If you last two more minutes, I 
will,” Boardman said. 

T he probe paused just outside the 
inner gate. Warily it switched 
on its gravitron and accumulated a 
ball of energy with a mass equivalent 
to its own. It thrust the energy ball 
through the doorway. Nothing hap- 
pened. 

The probe, satisfied, trundled to- 
ward the door itself. As it passed 
through, the sides of the door abrupt- 
ly crashed together like the jaws of 
a mighty press, destroying the probe. 
Rawlins’s screen went dark. Quickly 
he cut in one of the overhead probes, 
which beamed him a shot of his probe 
lying on the far side of the door, flat- 
tened into a two-dimensional mockup 
of itself. A human being caught in 
that same trap would have been 
crushed to powder, Rawlins realized. 



“My probe’s been knocked out,” 
he reported to Boardman. “Six min- 
utes and forty seconds.” 

“As expected,” came the reply, 
“We’ve got only two probes left. 
Switch over and watch.” 

The master diagram appeared on 
Rawlins’s screen: a simplified and 
stylized light-pen picture of the en- 
tire maze as viewed from above. A 
small X had been placed wherever 
a probe had been destroyed. Raw- 
lins found, after searching, the path 
his own drone had taken, with the 
X marked between the zone bounda- 
ries at the place of the clashing door. 
It seemed to him that the drone had 
penetrated farther than most of the 
others, but he had to smile at the 
childish pride the discovery brought 
him. Anyhow, two of the probes still 
were moving inward. One was actual- 
ly inside the second zone of the 
maze, and the other was cruising 
through a passageway that gave ac- 
cess to that inner ring. The diagram 
vanished, and Rawlins saw the maze 
as it looked through the pickup of 
one of the drones. Almost daintily, 
the man-high pillar of metal made 
its way through the baroque intrica- 
cies of the maze, past a golden pil- 
lar that beamed a twanging melody 
in a strange key, past a pool of light, 
past a web of glittering metal spokes, 
past spiky heaps of bleached bones. 
Rawlins had only glancing views of 
the bones as the drone moved on, but 
he was sure that few were human 
relics. This place was a galactic 
graveyard for the bold. 

Excitement built in him as the 
probe went on and on. He was so 
thoroughly wedded to it now that it 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE

was as if he were ipside the maze, 
avoiding one deathtrap after another, 
and he felt a sense of triumph as 
minutes mounted. Fourteen elapsed 
now. This second level of the maze 
was not so cluttered as the first; there 
were spacious avenues here, hand- 
some colonnades, long radiating pas- 
sages leading from the main path. He 
relaxed; he felt pride in the drone’s 
agility and in the keenness of its 
sensory devices. 

The shock was immense and sting- 
ing when a paving-block vended it- 
self unexpectedly and dumped the 
probe down a long chute to a place 
where the gears of a giant mill turned 
eagerly. 

T hey had not expected that probe 
to get so far, anyway. The one 
the others were watching was the one 
that had come in via the main gate — 
the safe gate. The slim fund of in- 
fonnation accumulated at the price 
of many lives had guided that probe 
past all its perils, and now it was 
well witbin Zone G, and almost to 
the edge of F. Thus far everything 
had gone as expected; the drone’s ex- 
periences had match^ those of the 
men who had tackled this route on 
earlier expeditions. It followed their 
way exactly, turning here, dodging 
there, and it was eighteen minutes 
into the maze without incident. 

*'A11 right,” Boardman said. 'This 
is where Mortenson died, isn’t it?” 
“Yes,” Hosteen answered. “The 
last thing he said was he was standing 
by that little pyramid, and then he 
was cut off.” 

Th^ is where we st^t gaining new 
information, then. All we’ve learned 



so far is that our records are accurate. 
This is the way in. But from here 
on — ” 

The probe, lacking a guidance pat- 
tern, now moved much more slowly, 
hesitating at every step to extend its 
network of data-gathering devices in 
all directions. It looked for hidden 
doors, for concealed openings in the 
pavement, for projectors, lasers, 
mass-detectors, power sources. It fed 
back to the central data banks all that 
it learned, thus adding to the store of 
information with each centimeter con- 
quered. 

It conquered, altogether, twenty- 
three meters. As it passed the small 
pyramid it scanned the broken body 
of the explorer Mortenson, lost at 
this point 72 years earlier. It relayed 
the news that Mortenson had been 
seized by a pressure-sensitive mangle 
activated by an unwary footstep too 
close to the pyramid. Beyond, it 
avoided two minor traps before fail- 
ing to safeguard itself from a distor- 
tion screen that baffled its sensors 
and left it vulnerable to the descent 
of a pulverizing piston. 

“The next one through will have 
to cut off all its inputs until it’s past 
that point,” Hosteen muttered. “Run- 
ning through blindfolded — well, 
well manage.” 

“Maybe a man would do better 
than a machine there,” said Board- 
man. “We don’t know if that screen 
would muddle a man the way it did 
a batch of sensors.” 

“We’re not ready yet to run a man 
in there,” Hosteen pointed out. 

Boardman agreed — none too gra^ 
ciously, Rawlins thought, listening to 
the interchange. The screen brig^ten-

ed again; a new drone probe was 
coming through. Hosteen had ordered 
a second wave of the machines to 
pick: through the labyrinth, following 
what was now known to be the one 
safe access route, and several of 
them were at the eighteen-minute 
point where the deadly pyramid was 
located. Hosteen sent one ahead and 
posted the others to keep watch. The 
lead probe came within range of the 
distortion screen and cut out its sen- 
sors; it heaved tipsily for a moment, 
lacking any way to get its bearings, 
but in a moment it was stable. It was 
deprived now of contact with its sur- 
roundings, and so it paid no heed to 
the siren song of the distortion screen, 
which had misled its predecessor into 
coming within range of the pulveriz- 
ing piston. The phalanx of drones 
watching the scene was all outside the 
reach of the distorter’s mischief, and 
fed a clear, true picture to the com- 
puter, which matched it with the fatal 
path of the last probe and plotted a 
route that skirted the dangerous 
piston. Moments later the blind probe 
began to move, guided now by inner 
impulses; lacking all environmental 
feedback, it was entirely a captive of 
the computer, which nudged it along 
in a series of prods ’til it was safely 
around the hazard. On the far side 
the sensors were switched on again. 
To check the procedure, Hosteen sent 
a second drone through, likewise 
blinded and moving entirely on inter- 
nal guidance. It made it. Then he 
tried a third probe with its sensors on 
and under the influence of the distor- 
tion screen. The computer attempted 
to direct it along the safe path, but 
the probe, bedeviled by the faulty in- 



f ormation goming through the distort* 
er, tugged itself furioudy to the side 
and was smashed. 

“All right,” Hosteen said. *T£ we 
can get a machine past it, we can get 
a man past it He closes his eyes 
the computer calculates his motions 
step by step. We’ll manage.” 

The lead probe began to move 
again. It got seventeen meters past 
the place of the distorter before it 
was nailed by a silvery grillwork that 
abruptly thrust up a pair of electrodes 
and cut loose with a bath of flame. 
Rawlins watched bleakly as the next 
probe avoided that obstacle and 
shortly fell victim to another. Plenty 
of probes waited patiently for their 
turns to press forward. 

And soon men will be going in 
there too, Rawlins thought. We*ll be 
going in there. 

He shut off his data terminal and 
walked across to Boardman. 

“How does it look so far?” he 
asked. 

“Rough, but not impossible,” 
Boardman said. “It can’t be this 
tough all the way in.” 

“And if it is?” 

“We won’t run out of probes. We’ll 
chart the whole maze until we know 
where all the danger points are, and 
then we’ll start trying it ourselves.” 
Rawlins said, “Are you going to 
go in there, Charles?” 

“Of course. So are you.” 

“With what odds on coming out?” 
“Good ones,” said Boardman. 
“Otherwise I doubt that I’d tackle it. 
Oh, it’s a dangerous trip, Ned, but 
don’t overestimate it. We’ve just be- 
gun to test that maze. We’ll show 
enough in a few days more.” 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE

Rawlins considered that a monient. 
“Muller jdidn’t have any probes,” he 
said finally. “How did he survive that 
stuff?” 

‘Tm not sure,” Boardman mur- 
mured. “I suppose he’s just a natur- 
ally lucky man.” 

VI 

W ithin the maze Muller watched 
the proceedings on his dim 
screens. They were sending some sort 
of robots in, he saw. The robots were 
getting chewed up quite badly, but 
each successive wave of them seemed 
to reach deeper into fhe labyrinth. 
Trial and error had led the intruders 
to the correct route through Zone H, 
and well onward into G. Muller re- 
mained calm at the center of it all, 
going about his daily pursuits. 

In the mornings he spent a good 
deal of time thinking over his past 
There had been other worlds in other 
years, springtimes, warmer seasons 
than this; soft eyes looking into his 
eyes, hands against his hands, smiles, 
laughter, shining floors and elegant 
figures moving through arched door- 
ways. He had married twice. Both 
times the arrangements had been ter- 
minated peacefully after a decent 
span of years. He had traveled wide- 
ly. He had dealt with ministers and 
kings. In his nostrils was the scent 
of a hundred planets strung across 
the sky. We make only a small blaze, 
and then we go out; but in his 
springtime and his summer he bad 
burned brightly enough, and he did 
not feel he had earned this sullen, 
joyless autumn. 

The city took care of him, after its 



fashion. He had a place to dwell, 
thousands of them; he moved from 
time to time for the sake of chang- 
ing the view. All of the houses were 
empty boxes. He had made a bed for 
hirnself of human hides stuffed with 
scraped fur; he had fashioned a chair 
from sinews and skin; he needed little 
else. The city gave him water. Wild 
animals roamed here in such quan- 
tity that he would never lack for food 
so long as he was strong enough to 
hunt. From Earth he had brought 
with him certain basic items. He had 
three cubes of books and one of mu- 
sic; they made a stack less than a 
meter high and could nourish his 
soul for all the years that remained 
to him. He had some woman cubes. 
He had a small recorder into which 
he sometimes dictated memoirs. He 
had a sketchpad. He had weapons and 
a mass detector. He had a diagnostat 
with a regenerating medical supply. It 
was enough. 

He ate regularly. He slept well. He 
had come almost to be content with 
his fate. One nurses bitterness only so 
long before one grows a cyst around 
the place from which the poison 
spews. 

He blamed no one now for what 
had happened to him. 

The way stations on his journey to 
this place were well known to him. 
At eighteen he had boasted of his 
lofty ambitions. At twenty-five he 
had begun to realize them. Before he 
was forty he had visited a hundred 
worlds and was famous in thirty sys- 
tems. And at the age of fifty-three he 
had let Charles Boardman talk him 
into undertaking the mission to Beta 
HydrilV.

IF 




T hat year he was on holiday in the 
Tau Ceti system, a dozen li^t- 
years from home. Accompanying him 
was a girl he had met the year be- 
fore and twenty light-years away. 

Her name was Marta. She was 
tall, slim, with large dark eyes fash- 
ionably rimmed with red, and lustrous 
blue hair that brushed her smooth 
shoulders. She looked about twenty, 
though of course she might just as 
well have been ninety and on her 
third shapeup; you never could tell 
about anyone, and especially not 
about a woman. But somehow Muller 
suspected that she was genuinely 
young. It wasn’t her litheness, her 
coltish agility — those are commodi- 
ties that can be purchased — but 
some subtle quality of enthusiasm, 
of true girlishness, that he liked to 
think was no surgical product. Wheth- 
er power-swimming or tree-floating or 
blowdart hunting or making love, 
Marta seemed so totally engaged in 
her pleasures that they must surely 
be relatively new to her. 

They stayed at a hotel that was a 
spire of brilliance , a thousand meters 
high, thrusting needle-straight out of a 
valley overlooking a glassy oval lake. 
Their rooms were two hundred floors 
up, and they dined at a rooftop eyrie 
reached by gravitron disk, while dur- 
ing the day all the pleasures of Mar- 
duk lay spread out before them. He 
was with her for a week, uninter- 
rupted. The weather was perfect. On 
the eighth day Charles Boardman ar- 
rived on Marduk and invited Muller 
to pay a call on him. 

“I’m on vacation,” Muller said. 
“Give me half a day of it. It’s an 
important matter.” 



“I came here to escape important 
matters.” 

“There’s never any escape, Dick. 
You know that. You are what you 
are, and we need you. Will you 
come?” 

“Damn you,” Muller said mildly. 

B oardman served drinks in his 
suite: an amber wine out of 
goblets made from blue rock crystal 
mined on Ganymede. Then they 
boarded a dining capsule and left the 
hotel to tour the forests and lakes 
while they ate. Lunch glided from its 
container and rolled toward them as 
they lounged in pneumochairs before 
a wraparound window. Crisp salad, 
grilled native fish, imported vegeta- 
bles; a grated Centaurine cheese to 
sprinkle; flasks of cold rice beer; a 
rich, thick, spicy green liqueur after- 
wards. Completely passive, sealed in 
their moving capsule, they accepted 
food and drink and scenery, breathed 
the sparkling air pumped in from out- 
side, watched gaudy birds flutter past 
them and lose themselves in the soft, 
drooping needles of the thickly pack- 
ed conifers of the woods. 

After lunch the capsule halted by 
the side of a jewel-like lake, deep and 
clear. The wall opened and Boardman 
said, “Perhaps the young lady would 
like to swim while we get the dull 
business talk out of the way?” 

“A fine idea,” Marta said in a flat 
voice. 

She rose, touched the disrobing 
snap at her shoulder, and let her gar- 
ment slither to her ankles. Boardman 
made a great show of catching it up 
and putting it on a storage rack. She 
smiled mechanically at him, turned. 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE

walked down to the edge of the lake. 

Boardman said, “She’s quite lovely, 
Dick. Who is she?” 

“A girl. Rather young, I think.” 

“Younger than your usual sort, I’d 
say. Also somewhat spoiled. Known 
her long?” 

“Since last year, Charles. Interest- 
ed?” 

Boardman gave him a Buddha-smile 
and gestured toward the liquor con- 
sole. Muller shook his head. The two 
men eyed one another. They appear- 
ed to be of the same age, mid-fifties, 
Boardman fleshy and graying and 
strong-looking. Sealed, they seemed 
of the same height, too. The appear- 
ances were deceptive: Boardman was 
a generation older, Muller half a foot 
taller. They had known each other for 
thirty years. In a way, they were in 
thd same line of work, both part of 
the corps of non-administrative per- 
sonnel that served to hold the struc- 
ture of human society together across 
the Sprawl of the galaxy. Neither had 
arify official rank. They shared a read- 
iness to serve, a desire to make their 
gifts useful to mankind, and Muller 
respected Boardman for the way he 
had used "those gifts during a long 
ahd impressive career. He could no 
say ' that he liked the older man, 
though. He knew that Boardman 
was shrewd, unscrupulous and dedi- 
cated to human welfare — and the 
combination of dedication and un- 
scrupulousness is always a dangerous 
one. 

Boardman drew a vision cube from 
a pocket of his tunic and put it on 
the table before Muller. It sat there 
like a counter in some intricate game, 
six or seven centimeters along each 

28 



face, soft yellow against the polished 
black marble face of the table. “Plug 
it in,” Boardman suggested. “The 
viewer’s beside you.” 

M uller slipped the cube into the 
receptor slot. From the center 
of the table there rose a larger cube, 
nearly a meter across. Images flower- 
ed on its faces. Muller saw a cloud- 
wrapped planet, soft gray in tone; it 
could have been Venus. The view 
deepened and streaks of dark red 
appeared in the gray. Not Venus, then. 
The recording eye pierced the cloud 
layer and revealed an unfamiliar, not 
very Earthlike planet. The soil look- 
ed moist and spongy, and rubbery 
trees that looked like giant toadstools 
thrust upward from it. It was hard to 
judge relative sizes, but they looked 
big. Their pale trunks were coarse 
with shredded fibers and curved like 
bows between ground and crown. 
Saucerlike growths shielded the trees 
at their bases, ringing them for about 
a fifth of their height. Above were 
neither branches nor leaves, only 
wide flat caps whose undersurfaces 
were mottled by corrugated pro- 
cesses. 

As Muller watched, three alien 
figures came strolling through the 
somber grove. They were elongated, 
almost spidery, with clusters of eight 
or ten jointed limbs depending from 
their narrow shoulders. Their heads 
were tapered and rimmed with eyes. 
Their nostrils were vertical slits flush 
against the skin. Their mouths open- 
ed at the sides. They walked upright 
on elegant legs that terminated in 
small globe-like pedestals instead of 
feet. Though they were nude except 

IP 




for probably ornamental strips of fab- 
ric tied between their first and second 
wrists, Muller was unable to detect 
signs either of reproductive apparatus 
or of mammalian functions. Their 
skins were unpigmented, sharing the 
prevailing grayness of this gray world, 
and were coarse in texture, with a 
scaly overlay of small ^amond- 
shaped ridges. 

With wonderful grace the three f igr 
ures approached three of the giant 
toadstools and scaled them until each 
stood atop the uppermost saucerlike 
projection of a tree. Out of the clus- 
ter of limbs came one arm that seem- 
ed specially adapted; unlike the oth- 
ers, which were equipped with five 
tendril-shaped fingers arranged in a 
circlet, this limb ended in a needle- 
sharp organ. It plunged easily and 
deeply into the soft rubbery trunk of 
the tree on which its owner stood. 
A long moment passed, as if the 
aliens were draining sap from the 
trees. Then they climbed down and 
resumed their stroll, outwardly un- 
changed. 

One of them paused, bent, peered 
close to the ground. It scooped up 
the eye that had been witnessing its 
activities. The image grew chaotic; 
Muller guessed that the eye was being 
passed from hand to hand. Suddenly 
there was darkness. The eye had been 
destroyed. The cube was played out. 

After a moment of troubled silence 
Muller said, “They look very con- 
vincing.” 

“They ought to be. They’re real.” 

“Was this taken by some sort of 
extragalactic probe?” 

“No,” Boardman said. “In our own 
galaxy.” 

THE MAN IN THE AAAZE 



“That be Beta Hydri IV, th^r 

“Yes.” 

Muller repressed a shiver. He 
tivated the cube a second time. Again 
the eye made the descent throe^ the 
cloud layer; again it observed the 
rubbery trees; again the trio d alieiia 
appeared, took nourishment froan the 
trees, noticed the eye, destroyed it. 
Muller studied the images with cdd 
fascination. He had never looked iq>- 
on living sapient beings of anotber 
creation before. No one bad, so far 
as he knew, until now. 

The images slowly faded from the 
cube. 

B oardman said, “That was taken 
less than a month ago. We part- 
ed a drone ship fifty thot^and kikme- 
ters up and dropp^ roughly a thou- 
sand eyes onto Beta Hydri IV. At 
least half of them went straight ^ 
the bottom of the ocean. Most landed 
in uninhabited or uninteresting (daces. 
This is the only one that actuafiy 
showed us a clear view of the aliens.” 
“Why have we d^ided to break 
our quarantine of this (danet?” 
Boardman slowly let out his breath. 
“We think it’s time we got in toudi 
with them, Dick. We’ve been sniffing 
around them for ten years and we 
haven’t said hello yet. This isn’t neigh* 
borly. And since the Hydrans ^id 
ourselves are the only intelligent races 
in this whole damned galaxy, unless 
something’s hiding somewhere un- 
likely, we’ve come to the belief that 
we ou^t to commence friendly re- 
lations.” 

“I don’t find your coyness very 
appealing,” Muller said bluntly. “A 
full-scale council decision was taken 

29 




after close to a year of debate, and 
it was voted to leave the Hydrans 
alone for at least a century unless 
they showed some sign of going into 
space. Who reversed that decision, 
and why, and when?” 

Boardman smiled his crafty smile. 
“I didn’t mean to seem deceptive, 
Dick. The decision was reversed by 
a council session eight months ago, 
while you were out Rigel way.” 
“And the reason?” 

One of the extragalactic probes 
came back with convincing evidence 
ihat there’s at least one highly intelli- 
gent and quite superior species in one 
of our neighboring clusters.” 
“Where?” 

“It doesn’t matter, Dick. Pardon 
me, but I won’t tell you at this time. 
Let’s just say that from what we 
know of them now, they’re much 
more than we can handle. They’ve 
got a galactive drive, and we can rea- 
sonably expect them to come visiting 
us one of these centuries, and when 
they do we’ll have a problem. So it’s 
been voted to open contact with Beta 
Hydri IV ahead of schedule, by way 
of having some insurance against that 
day.” 

“You mean“” Muller said, “that 
we want to make sure we’re on good 
terms with the other race of our own 
galaxy before the extragalactics show 
up?’^‘ 

“Exactly.” 

‘T’U take that drink now,” said 
Muller^ 

Boardman gestured. Muller tapped 
out a potent combination on the con- 
sole; downed it quickly, ordered an- 
other. Suddenly he had a great deal 
to digest. 



vn 

F or a couple of centuries man had 
explored the stars without find- 
ing a trace of a rival. There were 
plenty of planets, and many of them 
were potentially habitable, and a 
surprising number were Earthlike to 
four or five places. That much had 
been expected; the sky is full of 
main-sequence suns, with a good 
-many of the F-type and G-type stars 
most likely to support life. The pro- 
cess of planetogenesis is nothing re- 
markable, and most of those suns had 
complements of five to a dozen 
worlds, some of them were of the 
right size and mass and density slots 
to permit the retention of atmosphere 
and the convenient evolution of life, 
and a number of those worlds were 
situated within the orbital zone where 
they were best able to avoid extremes 
of temperature. So life abounded, 
and the galaxy was a zoologist’s de- 
light. 

But in his helter-skelter expansion 
out of his own system, man had 
found only the traces of former in- 
telligent species. The most spectacular 
ancient site was the maze of Lem- 
nos; but other worlds too had their 
sttumps of cities, their weathered 
foundations, their burial grounds and 
strewn potsherds. Space became an 
archeologist’s delight, too. The col- 
lectors of alien animals and the col- 
lectors of alien relics were kept busy. 
Whole new scientific specialties burst 
into being. Societies that had vanish- 
ed before the Pyramids had been 
conceived now underwent recon- 
struction. 

A curious blight of extinction had

come upon all of the galaxy’s other 
intelligent races, though. Evidently 
they had flourished so long ago that 
not even their decadent children sur- 
vived: they were one with Nineveh 
and Tyre, blotted out, cut off. Care- 
ful scrutiny showed that the young- 
est of the dozen or so known extra- 
solar intelligent cultures had perished 
eighty thousand years earlier. 

The galaxy is wide, and man kept 
on looking, drawn to find his stellar 
companions by some perverse mk- 
ture of curiosity and dread. Though 
the warp drive provided speedy 
transport to all points within the uni- 
verse, neither available personnel nor 
available ships could cope with the 
immensity of the surveying tasks. 
Several centuries after his intrusion 
into the galaxy, man was still making 
discoveries, some of them quite close 
to home. The star Beta Hydri had 
seven planets; and on the fourth was 
another sapient species. 

There were no landings. The possi- 
bility of such a discovery had been 
examined well in advance, and plans 
had been drawn to avoid a blunder- 
ing trespass of unpredictable conse- 
quences. The survey of Beta Hydri 
IV had been carried out from beyond 
its cloud layer. Cunning devices had 
measured the activity behind that 
tantalizing gray mask. Hydran energy 
production was known to a tolerance 
of a few million kilowatts; Hydran 
urban districts had been mapped and 
their population density estimated; 
the level of Hydran industrial devel- 
opment had been calculated by a 
study of thermal radiations. There 
was an aggressive, growing, potent 
civilization down there, probably 



comparable in technical level to late 
twentieth-century Earth. There was 
only one significant difference: the 
Hydrans had not begun to enter 
space. That was the fault of the 
cloud layer. A race that never has 
seen the stars is not likely to show 
much desire to reach them. 

Muller had been privy to the fran- 
tic conferences that followed the dis- 
covery of the Hydrans. He knew the 
reasons why they had been placed 
under quarantine, and he realized 
that only much more urgent rea- 
sons had resulted in the lifting of 
that quarantine. Unsure of its ability 
to handle a relationship with non-hu- 
man beings. Earth had wisely chosen 
to keep away from the Hydrans for 
a while longer; but now all that 
was changed. 

“What happens now?” Muller 
asked. “An expedition?” 

“Yes.” 

“How soon?” 

“Within the next year, I’d say.” 

Muller tensed. “Under whose lead- 
ership?” 

“Perhaps yours, Dick. 

“Why perhaps?” 

“You might not want it?” 

44TT^hen I was eighteen,” Muller 
VV said, “I was with a girl Out 
in the woods on Earth, in the Cali- 
fornia forest preserve, and I told her 
that I was going to discover things 
out in space, that men were going to 
remember me the way they remem- 
ber Columbus and Magellan and the 
early astronauts and all. And that was 
the night I grew my ambitions.” He 
laughed. “There are things we can 
say at eighteen, but not again.” 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



31 




“There are things we can do at 
eighteen that we can’t do again 
dther,” said Boardman. “Well, Dick? 
You’re past fifty now, right? You’ve 
walked in the stars. Do you feel like- 
a god?” 

“Sometimes.” 

“Do you want to go to Beta Hy- 
dri IV?” 

“You know I do?” 

“Alone?” 

Muller felt the ground give way 
before him, and abruptly it seemed 
t6 him that he was taking his first 
spacewalk again, falling freely toward 
all the universe. ** Alone?” 

“We’ve programmed the whole 
thing and concluded that to send a 
bunch of men down there at this 
point would be a mistake. The Hy- 
drans haven’t responded very well 
to our eye probes. You saw that: 
they picked the eye up and smashed 
it. We can’t begin to fathom their 
psychologies, because we’ve never 
been up against alien minds before. 
But we feel that the safest thing, 
both in terms of potential manpower 
loss and in terms of impact on their 
society, is to send a single ambassa- 
dor down there to them, one man, 
coming in peace, a shrewd, strong 
man who has been tested under a 
variety of stress situations and who 
will develop ways of initiating con- 
tact. That man may find himself 
chopped to shreds thi^ seconds after 
niaking contact. On the other hand, 
if he survives he’ll have accomplished 
something utterly unique in human 
history. It’s your option.” 

It was irresistible. Mankind’s am- 
bassador to the Hydrans! To go 
alone, to walk alien soil and extend 



humanity’s first greeting to cosmic 
neighbors — 

It was his ticket to immortality. It 
would write his name forever on the 
stars. 

“How do you figure the chances 
of survival?” Muller asked. 

‘The computation is one chance 
in sixty-five of coming out whole, 
Dick. Considering that it’s not an 
Earthtype planet to any great de- 
gree, so you’ll need a life-support 
syUtem, and you may get a chilly re- 
ception. One in sixty-five.” 

“Not too bad.” 

“I’d never accept such odds my- 
self,” Boardman said, grinning. 

“No, but I might.” He drained his 
glass. To carry it off meant imperish- 
able fame. To fail, to be slain by the 
Hydrans, even that was not so dread- 
ful. He had lived well. There were 
worse fates than to die bearing man- 
kind’s banner to a strange world. 
That throbbing pride of his, that hun- 
ger for glory, that childlike craving 
for renown that he had never out- 
grown, drove him to it. 

M arta reappeared. She was wet 
from her swim, her nude 
body glossy, her hair plastered to the 
slender column of her neck. She 
might have been a leggy fourteen- 
year-old, Muller thought, looking at 
her narrow hips, her lean thighs. 
Boardman tossed her a drier. She 
thumbed it and stepped into its yel- 
low field, making one complete turn. 
She took her garment from the rack 
and covered herself unhurriedly. 
“That was great,” she said. Her eyes 
met Muller’s for the first time since 
her return. “Dick, what’s the matter 



32 



IF 




with you? You look wide open — 
stunned. Are you all right?” 

“Fine.” 

“What happened?” 

“Mr. Boardman's made a proposi- 
tion.” 

“You can tell her about it, Dick. 
We don’t plan to keep it a secret. 
There’ll be a galaxy-wide announce- 
ment right away.” 

“There’s going to be a landing on 
Beta Hydri IV,” Muller said in a 
thick voice. “One man. Me. How will 
it work, Charles? A ship in a parking 
orbit, and then I go down in a pow- 
ered drop-capsule equipped for re- 
turn?” 

“Yes.” 

Marta said, “It’s insane, Dick, 
don’t do it.” ” 

“It’s a quick death if things don’t 
work out, Marta. I’ve taken worse 
risks before.” ” 

“No. Look, sometimes I think I’ve 
got a little precog. I see things ahead, 
Dick.” She laughed nervously, her 
pose of cool sophistication abruptly 
shattering. “If you go there, I don’t 
think you’ll live, either. Say you 
won’t go. Say it, Dick!” 

“You’ve never officially accepted 
the proposition,” Boardman said. 

“I know,” Muller said. He got 
to his feet, nearly reaching the low 
roof of the dining capsule, and walk- 
ed toward Marta and put his arms 
around her. He held her fifmly. She 
looked at him in horror. He kissed 
the tip of her nose and the lobe of 
her left ear. She shrank away from 
him, stumbled, nearly plunged into 
Boardman’s lap. Boardman caught 
her and held her. Muller said, “You 
know what the answer has to be.” 



T hat afternoon one of the robot 
probes reached Zone F. They 
stin had a distance to go; but it would 
not be long, Muller knew, before they 
were at the heart of the maze. 

VIII 

44^^here he is,” Rawlins said. “At 
1 last!” 

Via the drone probe’s eyes he 
stared at the man in the maze. Mul- 
ler leaned casually against a wall, 
arms folded, a big weatherbeaten man 
with a harsh chin and a massive 
wedge-shaped nose. He did not seem 
at ah alarmed by the presence of the 
drone. 

Rawlins cut in the audio pickup 
and heard Muller say, “Hello, robot. 
Why are you bothering me?” 

The probe, of course, did not reply. 
Neither did Rawlins, who could have 
piped a message to him through the 
drone. He stood by the data terminal, 
crouching a little for a better view. 
His weary eyes throbbed. It had taken 
them nine local-time days to get one 
of their probes all the way through 
the maze to the center. The effort 
had cost them close to a hundred 
probes; each inward extension of the 
safe route by twenty meters or so 
had required the expenditure of one 
of the robots. Still, that wasn’t so 
bad, considering that the number of 
wrong choices in the maze was close 
to infinite. Through luck, the inspired 
use of the ship’s brain and a study 
battery of sensory devices, they had 
managed to avoid all of the obvious 
traps and most of the cleverer ones. 
And now they were in the center. 
Rawlins had been up all night. 



THE AfUN IN THE MAZE 



33 




monitoring this critical phase, the 
penetration of Zone A. Hosteen had 
gone to sleep. So, finally, had Board- 
man. A few of the crewmen were 
still on duty, here and aboard the 
ship, but Rawlins was the only mem- 
ber of the civilian complement still 
awake. 

He wondered if the discovery of 
Muller had been supposed to take 
place during his stint. Probably not: 
Boardman wouldn’t want to risk 
blowing things by letting a novice 
handle the big moment. Well, too 
bad; they had left him on duty, and 
he had moved his probe a few meters 
inward, and now he was looking right 
at Muller. 

Muller looked sad around the eyes, 
and his lips were compressed in a 
taut, tense line. Rawlins had been ex- 
pecting something more dramatic, 
something romantic, some mirror of 
agony on that face. Instead he saw 
only the craggy, indifferent, almost in- 
sensitive-looking features of a tough, 
durable man in late middle age. Mul- 
ler had gone gray, and his clothing 
was a little ragged; he looked worn 
and frayed himself. But that was only 
to be expected of a man who had been 
living this kind of exile for nine 
years. 

“What do you want?” Muller asked 
the probe. “Who sent you? Why 
don’t you go away?” 

Rawlins did not dare to answer at 
this point. Brusquely he keyed the 
probe to freeze while he sped away 
toward the dome where Boardman 
slept. 

B oardman was sleeping under a 
canopy of life-sustaining devices. 



He was, after all, at least eighty years 
old, though he certainly didn’t look 
it, and one way to keep from looking 
it was to plug one’s self into one’s 
sustainers every night. Strapped to 
Boardman’s forehead were a couple 
of meningeal electrodes that guaran- 
teed a proper and healthy progression 
through the levels of sleep, thus wash- 
ing the mind of the day’s fatigue 
poisons. An ultrasonic drawcock fil- 
tered dregs and debris from Board- 
man’s arteries. Hormone flow was 
regulated by the ornate webwork hov- 
ering above his chest. The whole 
business was linked to and directed 
by the ship’s brain. Within the elab- 
orate life system Boardman looked 
unreal and waxy. His breathing was 
slow and regular; his soft lips were 
slack; his cheeks seemed puffy and 
loose-fleshed. Boardman’s eyeballs 
were moving rapidly beneath the 
lids, a sign of dreaming, of upper 
sleep. Could he be awakened safely 
now? 

Rawlins feared to risk it. Not di- 
rectly, anyway. He ducked out of the 
room and activated the terminal just 
outside. “Take a dream to Charles 
Boardman,” Rawlins said. “Tell him 
we found Muller. Tell him he’s got 
to wake up right away. Say, Charles, 
Charles, wake up, we need you. Got 
it?” 

“Acknowledged,” said the ship’s 
brain. 

The impulse leaped from dome to 
ship, was translated into response-di- 
rected form, and returned to the 
dome. Rawlins’s message seeped into 
Boardman’s mind through the elec- 
trodes on his forehead. Rawlins en- 
tered the old man’s sleeproom again.

34 




Boardman stirred. His hands form- 
ed claws and scraped gently at the 
machinery in whose embrace he lay. 

“Muller — ” he muttered. 

His eyes opened. For a moment he 
did not see. But the waking process 
had begun, and the life system jolted 
his metabolism sufficiently to get him 
functioning again. “Ned?” he said 
hoarsely. “What are you doing here? 
I dreamed that — ” 

“It wasn’t a dream, Charles. I 
programmed it for you. We got 
through to Zone A. We found Mul- 
ler.” 

Boardman undid his system and 
sat up instantly, alert, aware. “What 
time is it?” 

“Dawn’s just breaking.” 

“And how long ago did you find 
him?” 

“Perhaps fifteen minutes. I froze 
the probe and came right to you. 
But I didn’t want to rush you awake, 
so — ” 

“All right. All right.” Boardman 
had swung out of bed, now. He stag- 
gered a little as he got to his feet. 
He wasn’t yet at his da5rtime vigor, 
Rawlins realized; his real age was 
showing. He found an excuse to look 
away, studying the life system to 
avoid having to see the meaty folds of 
Boardman’s body. 

“Let’s go,” Boardman said. “Un- 
freeze that probe. I want to see him 
right away.” 

U sing the terminal in the hall, Raw- 
lins brought the probe back to 
life. The screen showed them Zone 
A of the maze, cozier-looking than 
the outer reaches. Muller was not 
in view. 



“Must have walked out of sight 
range,” Rawlins said. He moved the 
probe in a standing circle, taking in 
a broad sweep of low cubical houses, 
high-rising archways, and tiered walls. 
A small catlike animal scampered by, 
but there was no sign of Muller. 

“He was right over there,” Raw- 
lins insisted unhappily. “He — ” 
“All right He didn’t have to stay 
in one place while you were waking 
me up. Walk the probe around.” 
Rawlins activated the drone and 
started it in a slow cruising explora- 
tion of the street. Muller abruptly 
stepped out of a windowless building 
and planted himself in front of the 
probe. 

“Again,” he said. “Back to life, are 
you? Why don’t you speak up? What’s 
your ship? Who sent you?” 

“Should we answer?” Rawlins 
asked. 

“No.” 

Boardman’s face was pressed al- 
most against the screen. He pushed 
Rawlins’s hands from the controls 
and went to work on the fine tun- 
ing himself, until Muller was sharply 
in focus. Boardman kept the probe 
moving, sliding around in front of 
Muller, as though trying to hold the 
man’s attention and prevent him from 
wandering off again. 

In a low voice Boardman said, 
“That’s frightening. The look on his 
face — ” 

“I thought he looked pretty calm.” 
“What do you know? I remember 
that man. Ned, that’s a face out of 
hell. His cheekbones are twice as 
sharp as they used to be. His eyes 
are awful. You see the way his 
mouth turns down, on the left side? 



THE AUN IN THE MAZE 



35 




He might even have had a light 
stroke. But he’s lasted well enough, 
I suppose.” 

Muller, keeping pace with the 
drone, said in a deep, gruff voice, 
“You’ve got thirty seconds to state 
your purpose here. Then you’d better 
turn around, and get going back the 
way you came.” 

“Won’t you talk to him?” Rawlins 
asked. “He’ll wreck the probe.” 

“Let him,” said Boardman. “The 
first person who talks to him is go- 
ing to be flesh and blood, and he’s 
going to be standing face to face 
with him. That’s the only way it 
can be. This has to be a court^ip, 
Ned. We can’t go through the speak- 
ers of a probe.” 

‘Ten seconds,” said Muller. 

He reached into his pocket and 
came out with a glossy black metal 
globe the size of an apple, with a 
small square window on one side. 
Rawlins had never seen anything like 
it before. Perhaps it was some alien 
weapon Mueller had found in this 
city. Swiftly Muller raised the globe 
and aimed the window at the face 
of the drone probe. 

The screen went dark. 

“Looks like we’ve lost another 
probe,” Rawlins said. 

Boardman nodded. “‘Yes. The last 
probe we’re gdng to lose. Now we 
start losing men.” 

IX 

T he maze now was thoroughly 
mapped. The ship’s brain held a 
detailed picture of the inward route, 
with all the known pitfalls charted, 
and Boardman was confident that he 



could send drones in with a 95% 
probability of getting them to Zone 
A unharmed. Whedier a man could 
cover that same route with equal 
safety was what remained to be seal. 
Even with the computer vdiispering 
hints to him every step of the way, 
a man filtering information through a 
fallible, fatigue-prone human brain 
might not quite see things the same 
way as a lathe-turned probe, and per- 
haps would make compensations of 
his own in the course that would 
prove fatal. So the data they had 
gathered had to be tested carefully 
before they went in. 

There were volunteers for that. 

They knew that were likely to die. 
No one had tried to pretend other- 
wise to them, and they would have 
it no other way. It had been put to 
them that it was important for hu- 
manity to bring Richard Muller 
voluntarily out of the maze and that 
it could best be accomplished by 
having specific human beings — 
Charles Boardman and Ned Rawlins 
— speak to Muller in person, and that 
since Boardman and Rawlins were 
non-replaceable units it was necessary 
for others to explore the route ahead 
of them. Very well. The explOTOS 
were ready, knowing that they were 
expendable. 

They drew lots for the job. 

The man chosen to go first was a 
lieutenant named Burke, who looked 
fairly young and probably was, since 
military men rarely went in for shape- 
ups until they were in the top eche- 
lons. He was a short, sturdy dark- 
haired man v/ho acted as if he could 
be replaced from a template aboard 
the ship, which was not the case. 



36 



IF 




“When I find Muller/* Burke said 
— he did not say if — “I tell him 
I’m an archeologist, right? And that 
if he doesn’t min d Td like some of 
my friends to come inside also?” 
“Yes,” said Boardman. “And re- 
member, the less you say to him in 
the way of professional-sounding 
noises, the less suspicious he’s going 
to be.” 

B urke was not going to live long 
enough to say anything to Rich- 
ard Muller, and all of them knew 
it. But he waved good-bye jauntily, 
somewhat stagily, and strode into the 
maze. Through a backpack he was 
connected with the ship’s brain. The 
computer would relay his marching 
orders to him and would show the 
watchers in the camp exactly what 
was happening to him. 

He moved smartly and smoothly 
past the terrors of Zone H. He lack- 
ed the array of detection devices that 
had helped the probes find the pivot- 
mounted slabs and the deathpits be- 
neath, the hidden energy flares, the 
clashing teeth set in doorways and 
all the other nightmares; but he had 
something much more useful riding 
with him: the accumulated knowl- 
edge of those nightmares, gathered 
through the expenditure of a lot of 
probes that had failed to notice them. 
Boardman, watching his screen, saw 
the by now familiar pillars and spokes 
and escarpments, the airy bridges, the 
heaps of bones, the occasional debris 
of a drone probe. 

Burke took nearly forty minutes 
to pass from Zone H to Zone G. So 
far the guidance system was working 
well. Burke was executing a sort of 



grim ballet, dancing around the ob- 
stacles, counting his steps, now leap- 
ing, now turning sideways, now strain- 
ing to step over some treacherous 
strip of pavement. But the computer 
was unable to warn him about the 
small toothy creature waiting a top 
a gilded ledge forty meters inside 
Zone G. It was no part of the maze’s 
design. It was a random menace, 
transacting business on its own ac- 
count. 

The animal was no bigger than a 
very large cat, but its fangs were 
long and its claws were quick. The 
eye in Burke’s backpack saw it as it 
leaped, but by then it was too late. 
Burke, half-warned, half-turned and 
reached for his weapon with the beast 
already on his shoulders and scram- 
bling for his throat. 

Burke tumbled to the ground, 
clutching at his attacker. A trickle of 
blood spurted. Man and beast rolled 
over twice, tripped some secret wait- 
ing relay and were engulfed in a gust 
of oily smoke. When the air was 
clear again neither of them was in 
view. 

Boardman said a little later, 
“There’s something to keep in mind. 
The animals wouldn’t bother attack- 
ing a probe. We’ll have to carry mass 
detectors and travel in teams.” 

That was how they worked it the 
next time. Two men named Marshall 
and Petrocelli, armed, went together 
into the maze. No animal could come 
near them without teUtaling its ther- 
mal output into the infrared pickups 
of the mass detectors they carried. 
They shot four animals, one of them 
immense, and had no trouble other- 
wise. 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



37 




D eep within Zone G they came to 
the place where the distortion 
screen made a mockery of all infor- 
mation-gathering devices. 

How did the screen work. Board- 
man wondered? He knew of Earth- 
made distorters that operated di- 
rectly on die senses, taking perfect- 
ly proper sensory messages and 
scrambling them within the brain to 
destroy all one-to-one correlations. 
But this screen had to be different. 
It could not attact the nervous sys- 
tem of a drone probe, for the drones 
had no nervous systems in any mean- 
ingful sense of that term, and their 
eyes gave accurate reports of what 
they saw. Somehow what the drones 
had seen — and what they had report- 
ed to the computer bore no relation to 
the computer — bore no relation to 
the real geometry of the maze at 
that point. Other drones, posted be- 
yond the range of the screen, had 
given entirely different and much 
more reliable accounts of the terrain. 
So the thing must work on some di- 
rect optical principle, working on the 
environment itself, rearranging it, 
blurring perspective, subtly shifting 
and conceaEng the outlines of things, 
transforming normal configurations 
into bafflement. Any sight organ 
within reach of the screen’s effect 
would obtain a wholly convincing 
and perfectly incorrect image of the 
area, Aether or not it had a mind 
to be tinkered with. 

Marshall and PetroceTIi did as the 
computer said. They walked forward 
even where their own eyes told them 
that vast abysses lay in their path. 
They crouched to wriggle through a 
tunnel whose roof was bright with 



the suspended blades of guillotines. 
The tunnel did not exist. “Any min- 
ute I expect one of those blades to 
fall and chop me in half,” Petro- 
celli said. There were no blades. At 
the end of the tunnel they obediently 
moved to the left, toward a massive 
flan that lashed the ground in vicious 
swipes. There was no flail. Reluctant- 
ly they did not set foot on a plumply 
upholstered walkway that appeared to 
lead out of the region of the screen. 
The walkway was imaginary; they 
had no way of seeing the pit of acid 
that actually was there, 

**It would be better if they simply 
closed their eyes,” Boardman said. 
“The way the drones went through — - 
minus all visuals.” 

“They claim it’s too scary to do it 
like that,” said Hosteen. 

“Which is better: to have no visual 
information or to have the wrong in- 
formation?” Boardman asked. “They 
could follow the computer’s orders 
just as well with their eyes closed. 
And thereM be no chance that — ” 

Petrocelli screamed. On the split 
screen Boardman saw the real config- 
uration — a flat, innocuous strip of 
road — and the screen-distorted one 
relayed by the backpack eyes — a 
sudden geyser of flame erupting at 
their feet. 

“Stand where you are!” Hosteen 
bellowed. “It isn’t real!” 

Petrocelli, one foot high in the air, 
brought it back into place with a 
wrenching effort. MarshalFs reaction 
time was slower. He had been whirl- 
ing to escape the eruption when 
Hosteen was called to him, and he 
turned to the left before he halted. 
He was a dozen centimeters too far

out of the safe road. A coil of bright 
metal flicked out of a block of stone 
and wrapped itself about his ankles. 
It cut through the bone without diffi- 
culty. Marshall toppled and a flashing 
golden bar stapled him to a wall. 

Without looking back, Petrocelli 
passed through the column of flame 
unharmed, stumbled forward ten 
paces and dame to a halt, safe beyond 
the effective range of the distortion 
screen. “Dave?” he said hoarsely. 
“Dave, are you all right?” 

“He stepped off the path,” said 
Boardman. “It was a quick finish.” 
“What do you want me to do?” 
“Stay put, Petrocelli. Get calm and 
don’t try to go anywhere. I’m sending 
Chesterfield and Walker in after you.” 
It took them close to an hour to 
reach the place of the distortion 
screen and nearly fifteen minutes to 
shuffle through the few square me- 
ters the screen controlled. They did 
it with their eyes closed, and they 
didn’t like that at all; but the phan- 
toms of the maze could not frighten 
blind men, and in time Chesterfield 
and Walker were beyond their grasp. 
Petrocelli was much calmer by then. 
Warily, the three continued toward 
the heart of the maze. 

X 

T hey were winning the battle of 
the maze. Fourteen men had en- 
tered it so far. Four were dead. 
Walker and Petrocelli had made camp 
in Zone E; five more men had set up 
a relief base in F; three others were 
currently edging past the distortion 
screen in G and soon would join 
them. The worst was over for these. 



It was clear from the probe work 
that the curve of danger dropped off 
sharply past Zone F, and that there 
were practically no hazards at all in 
the three inner zones. With E and F 
virtually conquered, it should not be 
difficult to break through to those 
central zones where Muller, impassive 
and uncommunicating, lurked and 
waited. 

Rawlins felt that he knew the 
maze completely by now. Vicariously 
he had entered it more than a hundred 
times, first through the eyes of the 
probes, then through the relays from 
the crewmen. At night in feverish 
dreams he saw its dark patterns, its 
curving walls and sinuous towers. 
Locked in his own skull he somehow 
made the circuit of that labyrinth, 
kissing death a thousand times. He 
and Boardman would be the benefi- 
ciaries of hard-won experience when 
their turns came to go inside. 

Their turns were coming near. 

On a chill morning under an iron 
sky he stood with Boardman just 
outside the maze, by the upsloping 
embankment of soil that rimmed the 
outer flange of the city. In the short 
weeks they had been here, the year 
had dimmed almost startlingly toward 
whatever winter this planet got. Sun- 
light lasted only six hours a day, 
now, out of the twenty; two hours of 
pale twilight followed, and dawns 
were thin and prolonged. The whirl- 
ing moons danced constantly in the 
sky, playing twisting games with 
shadows. 

On the screen they watched Muller 
moying at the heart of the maze. The 
hovering probes kept constant check 
on him, marking his peregrinations

with a shifting line on the master 
chart. Muller had not left 2^one A 
since the time he had met the drone, 
but he changed positions daily in the 
labyrinth, migrating from house to 
house as though be feared to sleep 
in the same one twice. 

'"Tapping the screen, Boardman 
A said, “This afternoon we go in- 
side, Ned. We’ll spend the night in 
the main camp. T<xnorrow you move 
forward to join Walker and Petro- 
celli in E. The day after that you go 
on alone toward the middle and find 
MuUer.** 

“Why are you going inside the 
maze, Charles?®* 

“To help you.** 

“You could keep in touch with 
me from out here,” said Rawlins. 
“You don’t need to risk yourself.” 
Boardman tugged thoughtfully at 
his dewlap, “What Pm doing is cal- 
culated for minimum risk this way.” 
“How?” 

“If you get into problems,” Board- 
man said, “m need to go to you and 
give you assistance. Pd rather wait in 
Zone F if I’m needed than have to 
come rushing in suddenly from the 
outside, through the most dangerous 
part of the maze. You see what Fm 
telling you? I can get to you quickly 
from F without much danger. But 
not from here.” 

“What kind of problems?” 
“Stubbornness from Muller. He’s 
got no reason to cooperate with us, 
and he’s not an easy man to deal 
with. I remember him in those months 
after he came back from Beta Hydri 
IV. We had no peace with hkn. He 
was never actually level-tempered be- 

40 



fore, but afterward he was a volcano. 
Mind you, Ned, I don’t judge him 
for it; he’s got a ri^t to be furious 
with the universe. But he’s trouble- 
some. He’s a bird of ill omen. Just 
to go near him brings bad luck. You’ll 
have your bands fuB.” 

•*W^y don’t you come with me, 
then?” 

“Impossible,” Boardman said. “It 
would ruin everything if he even knew 
I was on this planet. I’m the man 
who sent him to the Hydrans, don’t 
forget. I’m the one who in eftect 
marooned him on L^nnos. I thkik 
he mig^t kill me if he saw me again.” 

Rawlins receded from that idea. 
“No. He hasn’t become that bar- 
baric.” 

“You don’t know him. What he 
was. What he’s become.” 

“If he’s as fuB of demons as you 
say, how am I ever gmng to win his 
trust?” 

“Go to him. Look guBetess and 
trustworthy. You don’t have to prac- 
tice that, Ned. You’ve got a naturally 
innocent face. TeB him you’re here on 
an archeological mission. Don’t let 
him know that we realized he was 
here aB along. Say that the first you 
knew was when our probe stumbled 
into him. That you recognized him, 
from the days when he and your fa- 
ther were friends. Tell him that your 
father’s dead and that this is your 
first expedition to space. Work on his 
sympathies, Ned. Dig for the pater- 
n^ in him.” 

Raisins shook his head. ‘TDon’t get 
angry with me, Charles, but I’ve got 
to teB you that I don’t like any of 
this. These lies.” 

“Lies?” Boardman’s eyes blazed. 

IP 




“Iie5 to say that you’re your fa- 
ther’s son? That this is your first ex- 
pedition?” 

“That I’m an archeologist?” 
Boardman shrugged. “Would you 
rather tell him that you came here 
as part of a search mission looking 
for Richard Muller? Will that help 
win his trust? Think about our pur- 
pose, Ned.” 

“Yes. Ends and means. I know.” 
“Do you, really?” 

“We’re here to win Muller’s coop- 
eration because we think that he alone 
can save us from a terrible menace,” 
Rawlins said stolidly, unfeelingly, 
flatly. “Therefore we must take any 
approach necessary to gain that co- 
operation.” 

“Yes. And I wish you wouldn’t 
smirk when you say it.” 

“I’m sorry, Charles. But I feel so 
damned queasy about deceiving him.” 
“We need him.” 

“All right, Charles.” 

“I need you, too,” Boardman said. 
“If I could do this myself, I would. 
But if he saw me, he’d finish me. 
In his eyes I’m a monster. It’s the 
same with anyone else connected 
with his past career. But you’re dif- 
ferent. He might be able to trust you 
You’re young, you look so damned 
virtuous, and you’re the son of a 
friend of his. You can get through.” 
“And fill him up with lies so we 
can trick him.” 

B oardman closed his eyes. He seem- 
ed to be containing himself 
with an effort. 

“Stop it, Ned,” 

“Go on. Tell me what I do after 
I’ve introduced myself.” 



“Build a friendship with him. Take 
your time about it. Make him come 
to depend on your visits.” ” 

“What if I can’t stand being with 
him?” 

“Conceal it. Show that you can 
tolerate his company. Make the ef- 
fort. Chat with him. Make it clear to 
him that you’re stealing time from 
your scientific work — that the vil- 
lainous bastards who are running 
your expedition don’t want you to 
have anything to do with him, but 
that you’re drawn to him by love and 
pity and won’t let them interfere. Tell 
him all about yourself — your am- 
bitions, your love life, your hobbies, 
what ever you want. Run off at the 
mouth. It’ll reinforce the image of 
the naive kid.” 

“Do I mention the galactics?” Raw- 
lin asked. 

“Not obtrusively. Work them in 
somewhere, by way of bringing him 
up to date on current events. But 
don’t tell him too much. Certainly 
don’t tell him of the threat they pose. 
Or a word about the need we have 
for him, you understand. If he gets 
the idea that he’s being used, we’re 
finished.” 

“How will I get him to leave the 
maze, if I don’t tell him why we want 
him?” 

“Let that part pass for now,” 
Boardman said. “I’ll coach you in the 
next phase after you’ve succeeded in 
getting him to trust you.” 

“The translation,” Rawlins said, 
“is that you’re going to put such a 
whopper in my mouth that you don’t 
dare tell me now what it is, for fear 
I’ll throw up my hands and quit.” 

“Ned — ” 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE

“I’m sorry. But look, Charles, why 
do we have to trick him out? Why 
can’t We just say that humanity needs 
him and force him to come out?” 
“Do you think that’s morally supe- 
rior to tricking him out?” 

“It’s cleaner, somehow. I hate all 
this dirty plotting and scheming. I’d 
much rather help knock him cold 
and haul him from the maze than 
have to go through what you’ve plan- 
ned.” 

Boardman said, “We can’t force 
him out. It’s too risky. He mi^t find 
some way to kill himself the mo- 
ment we tried to grab him.” 

“A stungun,” said Rawlins. “I 
could do it, even. Just get within 
range and gun him down, and then 
we carry him out of the maze and 
when he wakes up we explain — ” 
Boardman vehemently shook his 
head. “He’s had nine years to figure 
out that maze. We don’t know what 
tricks he’s learned or what defensive 
traps he’s planted. For all we know 
he’s programmed the whole place to 
blow up if someone pulls a gun on 
him. He’s got to come out of that 
labyrinth of his own free will, Ned, 
and that means we have to trick him 
with false promises. I know it stinks. 
The whole universe stinks, sometimes. 
Haven’t you discovered that yet?” 
“It doesn’t have to stink!” Rawlins 
said sharply, his voice rising. “Is 
that the lesson you’ve learned in all 
those years? The universe doesn’t 
stink. Man stinks! He’d rather stink 
than smell sweet. We don’t have 
to lie. We don’t have to cheat We 
could opt for honor and decency 
and — ” Rawlins stopped abruptly. 
In a different tone he said, “I sound 



young as hell to you, don’t I, 
Charles?” 

“You’re entitled to make mis- 
takes,” Boardman said. “That’s what 
being young is fw.” 

“You genuinely believe and know 
that there’s a cosmic malevolence in 
the workings of the universe?” 

B oardman touched the tips of his 
thick, short fingers together. “I 
wouldn’t put it that way. There’s no 
personal power of darkness running 
things, any more than there’s a per- 
sonal power of good. The universe 
is a big impersonal machine. As it 
functions it tends to put stress on 
some of its minor parts, and those 
parts wear out, and the universe 
doesn’t give a damn about that, be- 
cause it can generate replacements. 
There’s nothing immoral about wear- 
ing out parts, but you have to admit 
that from the point of view of the 
part under stress, it’s a stinking deal. 
It happened that two small parts of 
the universe clashed when we drop- 
ped Dick Muller onto the planet of 
the Hydrans. We had to put him 
there because it’s our nature to find 
out things, and they did what they 
did to him because the universe puts 
stress on its parts, and the result was 
that Dick Muller came away from 
Beta Hydri IV in bad shape. He was 
drawn into the machinery of the uni- 
verse and get ground up. Now we’re 
having a second clash of parts, equal- 
ly inevitable, and we have to feed 
Muller through the machine a second 
time. He’s likely to be chewed again, 
which stinks, and in order to push 
him into a position where that can 
happen, you and I have to stain our 

IF 



42 




souls a little, which also stinks, and 
yet we have absolutely no choice in 
the matter. If we don’t compromise 
ourselves and trick Dick Muller, we 
may be setting in motion a new spin 
of the machine that will destroy all 
of humanity, and that would stink 
even worse. I’m asking you to do an 
unpleasant thing for a decent motive.” 

“Where’s the room for free will in 
this mechanical universe of yours, 
Charles?” 

“There isn’t any. That’s why I say 
the universe stinks.” 

“Have you felt this way all your 
Ufe?” 

“Most of it,” Boardman said. 

“When you were my age?” 

“Even earlier.”” 

Rawlins stared at the screen. “Let’s 
go inside,” he said. “I’m tired of 
waiting.” 

XI 

M uller saw them coming closer, 
and he did not understand why 
he was so calm about it. He had de- 
stroyed that robot, yes, and after that 
they had stopped sending robots in. 
But his viewing tanks showed him 
the men camping in the outer levels. 
He could not see their faces clearly. 
He could not see what they were 
doing out there. He counted about a 
dozen of them, give or take two or 
three; some were settled in Zone E, 
and a somewhat larger group in F. 
Muller had seen a few of them die in 
the outer zones. 

He had ways of attacking. He 
could, if he cared to, flood Zone E 
with backup from the aqueduct He 
had done that once, by accident, and 



it had taken the city almost a full 
day to clean things up; he recalled 
how during the flood Zone E had 
been sealed off, bulkheaded to keep 
the water from spilling out. If the in- 
truders did not drown in the first 
rush, they would certainly blunder in 
alarm into some of the traps. Muller 
could do other things, too, to keep 
them from getting to the inner city. 

Yet he did nothing. He knew that 
at the heart of his inaction was a 
hunger to break his years of isolation. 
Much as he hated them, much as he 
feared them, much as he dreaded the 
puncturing of his privacy, Muller al- 
lowed the men to work their way 
toward him. 

Muller had spent part of a year 
among the Hydrans; and then, see- 
ing he was accomplishing nothing, he 
entered his powered drop-capsule, 
rode it into the heavens, and repos- 
sessed his orbiting ship. If the Hy- 
drans had a mythology, he would be- 
come part of it. 

Within his ship Muller went 
through the operations that wmdd 
return him to Earth. As he notified 
the ship’s brain of his presence he 
caught sight of himself in the bur- 
ni^ed metal plate of the input bank, 
and it frightened him, a little. The 
Hydran^ did not use mirrors. Muller 
saw deep new lines etched on his face, 
which did not bother him, and he 
saw a strangeness in his eyes, which 
did. The muscles are tense, he told 
himself. He finished programming his 
return and went to the medic cham- 
ber and ordered a forty-db drop in 
his neural level, along with a hot 
bath and a thorough massage. When 
he came out his eyes still looked 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



43 




strange and he had sprouted a facial 
tic, besides. He got rid of the tic 
easily enough, but he could do noth- 
ing about his eyes. 

The ship gulped power from the 
nearest designated donor star. The 
ship’s rotors whirled along the axes 
of warp, and Muller along with his 
plastic and metal container was hurl- 
ed out of the universe on one of the 
shortcut routes. 

He had no work to do. The ship 
duly popped from warp within the 
prescribed limits, 100,000 kilometers 
out from Earth, and colored lights 
flashed on his communications board 
as the nearest traffic station signalled 
for his bearings. 

“Match velocities with us, Mr. 
Miiller, and we’ll send a pilot aboard 
to get you to Earth,” the traffic con- 
troller said. 

M uller’s ship took care of it. The 
coppery globe of the traffic 
station appeared in sight. 

“We have a relay message for 
you from Earth,” the controller said. 
“Charles Boardman calling.” 

“Go ahead,” said Muller. 
Boafdman’s face filled the screen. 
He Iboked pink and newly buffed, 
quite healthy, well rested. “Dick,” 
he said. “God, it’s great to see you 
again!” 

Muller activated tactile and put his 
hand on Boardman’s wrist through 
the screen. “Hello, Charles. One in 
sixty-five, eh? Well, I’m back.’* 
“Should I tell Marta?” 

‘*Marta,” Muller said, thinking for 
a moment. Yes. The blue4iaired 
wench with the swivel hips and the 
sha^ heels. “Yes. Tell Marta. It 



would be nice if she met me when I 
landed.” 

Boardman laughed. Then he said, 
“How did it go?” 

“Poorly.” 

“You made contact, though?” 

“I found the Hydrans, yes. They 
didn’t kill me.” 

“Yes, but — ” 

“I’m alive, Charles.” Muller felt 
the tic beginning again. “I didn’t learn 
their language. I can’t tell you if they 
approved of me. They seemed quite 
interested. They studied me closely 
for a long time. They didn’t say a 
word.” 

“What are they, telepaths?” 

”I can’t tell you that, Charles.” 
Boardman was silent for awhile. 
“What did they do to you, Dick?” 
“Nothing.” 

“That isn’t so.” 

“What you’re seeing is battle fa- 
tigue,” Muller said. “I’m in good 
shape, just a little stretched in the 
nerve. I want to breathe real air 
and drink some real beer and taste 
real meat, and I’d like to have some 
company in bed, and I’ll be as good 
as ever.” 

“How’s the gain on your broadcast 
system, Dick?” 

“Huh?” 

“You’re coming across too loud,” 
said Boardman. 

“Blame it on the relay station. 
Jesus, Charles. What does the gain 
on my system have to do with any- 
thing?” 

“I’m not sure,” Boardman said. 
“I’m just trying to find out why 
you’re shouting at me.” 

“I’m not shouting,” Muller shout- 
ed. 



44 



IP 




S oon after that they broke contact. 

Muller had word . from the 
traffic station that they were ready 
to send a pilot aboard. He got the 
hatch ready and let the man in. The 
pilot was a very blond young man 
with hawklike features and pale skin. 
As soon as he unhelmeted he said , 
“My name is Les Christiansen, Mr. 
Muller, and I want to tell you that 
it’s an honor and a privilege for me 
to be the pilot for the first man to 
visit an alien race. I hope Fm not 
breaking security when I say that I’d 
love to know a little about it while 
we’re descending. I mean, this is 
sort of a moment in history, me being 
the first to see you in person since 
you’re back, and if it’s not an intru- 
sion I’d be grateful if you’d tell me 
just some of the — highlights — of 
your — of — ” 

guess I can tell you a little,” 
Muller said affably. “First did you 
see the cube of the Hydrans? I know 
it was supposed to be shown, and — ” 
“You mind if I sit down a second, 
Mr. Muller?” 

“Go ahead.” 

“I feel very woozy,” said Chris- 
tiansen. “I don’t know what’s hap- 
pening.” His face was crimson, sud- 
denly, and beads of sweat glistened 
on his forehead. “I think I must be 
getting sick.” The pilot crumpled into 
a webfoam cradle and huddled there, 
shivering, covering his head with his 
hands. Muller hesitated helplessly. 
Finally he reached down to take the 
mao’s elbow and guide him toward 
the medic chamber. Christiansen 
whirled away as if touched by fiery 
metal. The motion pulled him o^ 
balance ajod sent him into a heap on 

THE Ai\AN IN THE MAZE 



the cabin floor. He rose to his knees 
and wrig^ed until he was as far away 
from Muller as it was possible to get. 
In a strangled voice he said, “WhCTe 
is it?” 

“That door there.” 

Christiansea rushed for it, sealed 
himself in, and rattled the door to 
make sure of it. Muller, astonidied, 
heard retching sounds and then some- 
thing that could have be^ a series 
of dry sobs. He was about to signal 
the traffic station that the pilot was 
sick when the door opened a little 
and Christiansen said muffle^y, 
“Would you hand me my hehnet, Mr. 
Muller?” 

Muller gave it to him. 

“I’m going to have to go back to 
my station, Mr. Muller.” 

“I’m sorry you reacted this way. 
Christ, I hope I’m not carrying some 
kind of contagion.” 

“Fm not sick. I just feel — lousy,” 
Christiansen fastened the helmet in 
place. “1 don’t understand. But 1 
want to curl up and cry. Please let 
me go, Mr. Muller. It — I — that 
is — it’s terrible, that’s what I feell” 
He rushed into the hatch. In bewi^ 
derment Muller watched him cross 
the void to the nearby traffic station. 

He got on the radio. “You better 
not send another pilot over just 
yet,” Muller told the control. 
Christiansen folded up with instard 
plague as soon as he took his helmet 
off. I may be carrying something. 
Let’s dieck it out.” 

The controller, looking troubled, 
agreed. He asked Muller to go to his 
medic chamber, set up the diagno- 
stat, and transmit its report. A little 
while later the solemn chocolate-hued 



45 




face of the station’s medical officer 
appeared on Muller’s screen and said, 
“This is very odd, Mr. Muller. I’ve 
run your diagnostat transmission 
through our machine. No unusual 
symptoms. I’ve also put Christiansen 
through the works without learning 
anything. He feels fine now, he says. 
He told me that an acute depression 
hit him the moment he saw you, and 
it deepened in a hurry to a sort of 
metabolic paralysis. That is, he felt 
so gloomy that he could hardly func- 
tion.” 

“Is he prone to these attacks?” 
“Never,” the medic replied. “I’d 
like to check this out myself. May I 
come over?” 

T he medic didn’t curl up with the 
miseries as Christiansen had done. 
He didn’t stay long, either, and when 
he left his face was glossy with tears. 
He looked as baffled as Muller. 
When the new pilot appeared, twenty 
minutes later, he kept his suit on as 
he programmed the ship for plan- 
etary descent. Sitting rigidly upright 
at bis controls, his back turned to 
Muller, he said nothing, scarcely 
acknowledged Muller’s presence. As 
required by law, he brought the ship 
down until its drive system was in 
the grip of a groundside landing reg- 
ulator, and took his leave. Muller 
saw the man’s face, tense, sweatshiny, 
tight'ilipped. The pilot nodded curtly 
and went through the hatch. I must 
have a very bad smell, Muller 
thought, if he could smell it through 
his suit like that. 

The landing was routine. 

At the starport he cleared Immi- 
gration quickly. He had feared that 



the giant starport diagnostat would 
detect whatever malady he carried 
that his own equipment and the traf- 
fic station medic had failed to find; 
but he passed through the bowels of 
the machine, letting it bounce sonics 
off his kidneys and extract some mol- 
ecules of his various bodily fluids, 
and at length he emerged without the 
ringing of bells and the flashing of 
warning lights. Approved, He spoke 
to the customs machine. Where from, 
traveler? Where bound? Approved. 
His papers were in order. A slit in 
the wall widened into a doorway, and 
he stepped through, for the first time 
since his landing confronting another 
human being. 

Boardman had come to meet him. 
Marta was with him. Her hair was 
short and sea- green; she had silvered 
her eyes and gilded the slender col- 
umn of her throat, so that she looked 
like some jeweled statuette of herself. 

Boardman’s hand encircled Muller’s 
wrist in a firm greeting that incredi- 
bly turned flabby within seconds. The 
hand slipped away even before Mul- 
ler could return the embrace. “It’s 
good to see you, Dick,” Boardman 
said without conviction, stepping back 
a couple of paces. His cheeks seemed 
to sag as though under heavy gravi- 
tational stress. Marta slipped between 
them and pressed herself against him. 
Muller did not kiss her. Her eyes 
were dazzling as he looked within 
them and felt himself lost in rebound- 
ing mirror images. Her nostrils flared. 
Through her thin flesh he felt mus- 
cles bridling. She was trying to get 
free of him. “Dick,” she whispered. 
“I’ve prayed for you every night. You 
don’t know how I missed you.” She

IF 




struggled harder. She turned her head 
to one side. He put his cheek against 
her delicate ear. ‘‘Dick,** she mur- 
mured, “I feel so strange — so glad 
to see you that Fin all tanked up in- 
side — let go, Dick, I feel qijeasy 
somehow — ** 

Yes. Yes. Of course. He released 
her. 

Boardman, sweating, nervous, mop- 
ped at his face, jabbed himself with 
some soothing drag, fidgeted, paced, 
Muller had never seen him look this 
way before. “Suppose I let the two 
of you have some time togetiiCT, eh?” 
Boardman suggested, his voice com- 
ing out half an octave too high. “The 
weather’s been getting to me, Dick. 
I’ll talk with you tomorrow. Your ac- 
commodations are all arranged.” 
Boardman fled. Now MuHcr fdt 
panic riOTg. 

“Where do we goT* he asked. 

“There’s a transport pod outtide. 
We have a room at the Starport Inn.” 

Marta was diewing at ^ oornw 
of her lower lip. He took her by die 
hand, and tiicy rode the slidewalk out 
of the terminal room, to the hiinspor- 
tation pods. Go on, he thought. Tel! 
me that you don^ fed well. Tdl me 
that mysteriously you’ve come down 
with something in the last ten minutes. 

“Why did you cut your hair?” he 
asked. 

“It’s a woman’s right. Don’t you 
like it this way?” 

“Not as much.” They ^tered the 
pod. “Longer, bluer, it was like the 
sea on a stormy day.” The pod shot 
off on a bath of quicksilver. She kept 
far to her ride, hunched against the 
hatdi. ‘‘And the make-up, too. Fm 
sorry, Marta. I wish I could like it.** 

THE MAN IN THE AAAZE 



“1 was prettying for your home- 
coming.” 

“Why are you doing th?d with 
your lip?” 

“What am I doing?” 

“Nothing,” he said. “Here wc arc. 
The loom is booked already?” 

“In your name, yes.” 

r \cy went in. He put his hand on 
the regtstration plate. It flashed 
green, and they headed for the lift- 
shaft. The inn began in the fifth sob- 
level of the starport and went down 
for fifty levels; their room was near 
the bottom. Choice location, he 
thought. The bridal mite, maybe. 
They stepped into a room with k^ei- 
dosoopic hangings and a wide bed 
with all accessories. The roomglow 
was tactfully dim. Muller thought of 
months of woman cubes ^d a savage 
throbbing rose in him. She moved 
past him into Ihe personal room, 
and was in there a long while. 

When she came out all the tricky 
make-up was gone, and her hair was 
blue again. 

“Like the sea,” she said, “i’m sorry 
I couldn’t grow it back m there. The 
room wasn’t programmed for H.” 
“It’s much better now.” He studied 
h«-. ‘The Hydrans,” he saki, ‘have 
either five scjks or none. I’m not 
sure which. That’s a measure of how 
well I got to know them while I 
was there. However they do it, I 
think people have moto fun. ^I\^y 
are you standing over there, Marta?” 
Silently she came toward him. Sic 
quivered a littie, like a shy mare 
wanting to bolt He put his Kps to her 
Kps, and they were dry, taut, hos- 
tile. Ihey sat side by side on the bed.

He saw pain rise in her eyes. 
“Tell me whafs wrong, Marta.*^ 

“I don’t know.” 

“You’re acting like you’re sick.” 

“I think I am.” 

“When did you start feeling ill?” 

“I — oh, Dick, why all these ques- 
tions? Please, love, come close.” 
“You don’t want me to.” 

“I’m trying to make you happy, 
Dick. It — it hurts so much — so 
much — ” 

“What does?” 

She wouldn’t answer. She gestured 
wantonly and tugged at him again. 
He sprang from the bed. 

“Dick, Dick, I warned you not to 
go. I said I had some precog. And 
that other things could happen to you 
there besides getting killed.” 

“Tell me what hurts you.” 

“I can’t. I — don’t know.” 

“That’s a lie.” 

“When did it start?” 

“This morning. When I got up.” 
“That’s another lie. I have to have 
the truth!” 

“Make love to me, Dick. I can’t 
wait much longer. I — ” 

“You what?” 

“Can’t — stand — ” 

“Can’t stand what?” 

“Nothing. Nothing.” She was off 
the bed too, rubbing against him, a 
cat in heat, shivering, muscles leap- 
ing in her face, eyes wild. 

He caught her wrists and ground 
the bones together. 

“Tell me what it is you can’t stand 
much longer, Marta.” 

She gasped. He squeezed harder. 
‘Tell me,” he said. “You can’t 
stand — ” 

— being near you,” she said. 



W ithin the maze the air was 
somehow warmer and sweet- 
er. The walls must cut off the winds, 
Rawlins thought. He walked care- 
fully, listening to the voice at his ear. 

Turn left . three paces . put 
your right foot beside the black 
stripe on the pavement . pivot . 
turn left . four paces . ninety- 
degree turn to the right . immedi- 
ately make a ninety-degree turn to 
the right again . 

It was like a children’s street game. 
Step on a crack, break your mother’s 
back. The stakes were higher here, 
though. He moved cautiously, feeling 
death nipping at his heels. Ahead an 
energy flare spurted across the path. 
The computer called off the timing 
for him. One, two, three, four, five, 
GO! Rawlins went. 

Safe. 

On the far side he halted flatfooted 
and looked back. Boardman was 
keeping pace with him, unslowed by 
age. Boardman waved and winked. 
He went through the patterns, too. 
One, two, three, four, five, GO! 
Boardman crossed the place of the 
energy flare. 

Rawlins could not help looking at 
the bones. Dry skeletons ages old, 
and some bodies that were not old at 
all. Beings of many races had perish- 
ed here. 

What if I die in the next ten 
minutes? 

Bright lights were flashing now, 
on and off many times a second. 
Boardman, five meters behind him, 
became an eerie figure moving in 
disconnected movements, as though 



48 



IF 




every other fraction of a second had 
simply been punched out of his 
awareness. 

The computer told him! Walk 
ten paces and halt. One. Two. Three. 
Walk ten paces and halt. One. Two. 
Three. Walk ten paces and halt. 

Rawlins could not remember what 
would happen to him if he failed 
to keep to the proper timing. Here 
in Zone H the nightmares were so 
thick that he could not keep them 
straight in his mind. Was this the 
place where a ton of stone fell on 
the Unwary? Where the walls came 
together? Where a cobweb-dainty 
bridge delivered victims to a lake of 
fire? 

His estimated life-span at this point 
was two hundred five years. He want- 
ed to have most of these years. I am 
too uncomplicated to die yet, Ned 
Rawlins thought. 

He danced to the computer’s tune, 
past the lake of fire, past the clash- 
ing walls. 

S omething with long teeth perched 
on the lintel of the door ahead. 
Carefully Charles Boardman un- 
slung the gun from his backpack and 
cut in the proximity-responsive target 
finder. He keyed it for 30 kilograms 
of mass and downward, at 50 meters. 
“I’ve got it,” he told Rawlins, and 
fired. 

The energy bolt splashed against 
the wall. Streaks of shimmering green 
sprouted along the rich purple. The 
beast leaped, limbs outstretched in a 
final agony, and fell. From some- 
where came three small scavengers 
that began to rip it savagely into the 
finest shreds. 



Images played on a golden screen 
bracketed to a w^l near the inner 
end of Zone H. Rawlins saw his fa- 
ther’s face take form, coalesce with an 
underlying pattern of bars and cross- 
es, burst into flame. The screen was 
externally primed; what it showed 
was in the eye of the beholder. The 
drones, passing this point, had seen 
only the blank screen. Rawlins watch- 
ed the image of a girl appear. Mari- 
beth Chambers, sixteen years old, 
sophomore in Our Lady of Mercies 
High School, Rockford, Illinois. Mar- 
ibeth Chambers smiled shyly and be- 
gan to remove her clothes. 

“I am the Resurrection and the 
Life,” said Maribeth Chambers in a 
husky, passionate voice. 

Sbe beckoned. She gave him a bed- 
room wink. She giggled. She wrig- 
gled. She heaved her shoulders and 
made her breasts ring like tolling 
bells. 

Her skin turned deep green. Her 
eyes slid about in her face. Her low- 
er lip stretched forth like a shovel. 
Her thighs began to melt. Patterns of 
flame danced on the screen. Rawlins 
heard deep throbbing ponderous 
chords from an invisible organ. He 
listened to the whispering of the brain 
that guided him and went past the 
screen unharmed. 

The screen , showed abstract pat- 
terns: a geometry of power, rigid 
marching lines and frozen figures. 
Charles Boardman paused to admire 
it for a moment. 

Then he moved on. 

A forest of whirling knives near 
the inner border of Zone H. 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



49 




The heat grew strangely intense. 
One had to tiptoe over the pavement. 
This was troublesome because none 
who had passed this way before had 
experienced it. Did the route vary? 
Could the city introduce variations? 
How hot would it get? Where would 
the zone of warmth end? Did cold 
lie beyond? Would they live to reach 
Zone E? Was Richard Muller doing 
this to prevent them from entering? 

Maybe he recognizes Boardman 
and is trying to kill him. There is that 
possibility. Muller has every reason 
to hate Boardman, and he has had 
no chance to undergo social adjust- 
ment. Maybe I should move faster 
and open some space between Board- 
man and myself. It seems to be get- 
ting hotter. On the other hand, he 
would accuse me of being cowardly. 
And disloyal. 

Maribeth Chambers would never 
have done those things. 

Do nuns still shave their heads? 

B oardman found the distortion 
screen deep inside Zone G per- 
haps the worst of all. He was afraid 
of entering a place where the evi- 
dence of his senses did not correspond 
to the real universe. Boardman de- 
pended on his senses. He was wearing 
his third set of retinas. You can make 
no meaningful evaluations of the uni- 
verse without the confidence that you 
are seeing it clearly. Now he was 
within the field of the distortion 
screen. 

Parallel lines met here. The tri- 
angular figures emblazoned on the 
moist, quivering walls were construct- 
ed entirely of obtuse angles. A river 



ran sideways through the valley, TTiO 
stars were quite close and the mooas 
orbited one another. 

What we now must do is close 
our eyes and not be deceived. 

Left foot. Right foot. Left foot. 
Right foot. Move to the left slightly 
slide your foot. Back toward the right. 
Thafs it. Start walking again. 

Forbidden fruit tempted him. All 
his life he had tried hard to see clear- 
ly. The lure of distortions was irre- 
sistible. Boardman halted, planting 
each foot firmly. If you hope to get 
out of this, he told himself, you will 
keep your eyes closed. If you open 
your eyes you will be misled and go 
to your death. 

Boardman remained quite still. The 
silent voice of the computer tried to 
prod him on. 

“Wait,” said Boardman quietly. “I 
can look around a little if I don’t 
move. You can’t get into trouble if 
you don’t move.” 

The ship’s brain reminded him of 
the geyser of flame that had sent 
Marshall to his death. 

Boardman opened his eyes. All 
about him he saw the negation of 
geometry. This was the inside of the 
Klein bottle, looking out. Disgust rose 
like a green column within him. 

You are eighty years old and you 
know how the universe should look. 
Close your eyes now, C.B. Close 
your eyes and move along. You’re 
taking undue risks. 

First he sought Ned Rawlins. The 
boy was twenty meters ahead of him, 
shuffling slowly past the screen. Eyes 
closed? Of course. All of them. Ned 
was an obedient boy. Or a frightened 




Boardman began to lift his right 
leg, checked himself, reimplanted it 
on the pavement. Just ahead, pulsa- 
tions of golden light leaped in the air, 
taking now the form of a swan, now 
the form of a tree. Ned Rawlins’s 
left shoulder rose too high. His back 
was humped. One leg moved forward, 
and the other moved backward. 
Through golden mists Boardman saw 
the corpse of Marshall stapled to the 
wall. Marshall’s eyes were wide open. 
Looking into those eyes Boardman 
saw his own curving reflection, aU 
nose, no mouth. He closed his eyes. 

The computer, relieved, directed 
him onward. 

A sea of blood, A cup of lymph. 

To die, not having loved — 

This is the gateway to Tjone F. I 
am now leaving deatWs other king’- 
dom. Where is my passport? Do 1 
need a visa? I have nothing to de- 
clare. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. 

O n the far side of the gateway 
Rawlins stopped short and asked 
the computer if it were safe for him 
to squat and rest. The brain said that 
it was. Gingerly, Rawlins lowered 
himself, rocked on his heels a mo- 
ment, touched his knee of the cool 
pebble-textured pavement He looked 
back. Behind him, colossal blocks of 
stone set without mortar and fit to a 
perfect truing were piled fifty meters 
highj flanking a tall narrow aper- 
ture through which the solid form 
of Charles Boardman now was pass- 
ing. Boardman looked sweaty and 
flustered. Rawlins found that fascin- 
ating. He had never seen the old 
man’s smugness pierced before. 



Rawlins himself was none too 
steady. Metabolic poisons boiled in 
the tubes and channels of his body. 
He was drenched with perspiration 
so thoroughly that his clothing was 
working overtime to get rid of it, dis- 
tilling the moisture and volatilizing 
the substratum of chemical com- 
pounds. 

Boardman came alongside and 
squatted. Rawlins had to steady him 
as he balanced before kneeling. 

Rawlins said, “Muller came this 
way alone and made it.” 

“Muller was always an extraordin- 
ary man.” 

“How do you think he did it?” 

“Why don’t you ask him?” 

“I mean to,” Rawlins said. “Per- 
haps by this time tomorrow I’ll be 
talking to him.” 

“They’ll be coming out to meet us 
soon. They should have fixes on us by 
now. We must be showing up on 
their mass detectors. Up, Ned. Up.” 

They stood. Once again Rawlins 
led the way. 

In Zone F things were less clut- 
tered but also less attractive. The 
prevailing mood of the architecture 
was taut, with a fussy line that gen- 
erated a tension of mismatched ob- 
jects. Though he knew that traps 
were fewer here, Rawlins still had 
the sensation that the ground was 
likely to open beneath him at any 
given moment. The air was cooler 
here. It had the same sharp taste as 
the air on the open plain. At each of 
the street intersections rose immense 
concrete tubes in which jagged, 
feathery plants were standing. 

“Which is the worst part for you 
so far?” Rawlins asked. 



52 



IF 




“The distortion screen,” said 
Boardman. 

“That wasn’t so bad. Unless you 
feel peculiar about walking through 
stuff this dangerous with your eyes 
closed. 

“I peeked,” said Boardman. 

“In the distortion zone?” 

“Just for a moment. I couldn’t re- 
sist it, Ned.” 

Rawlins smiled. He wanted to con- 
gratulate Boardman on having done 
something silly and dangerous and 
human, but he didn’t dare. He said, 
“What did you do? Just stand still 
and peek and then move on?” 

“I forgot myself and started to 
take a step, but I didn’t follow 
through. I kept my feet planted and 
looked around.” 

“Maybe I’ll try to try that on the 
way out,” Rawlins said. “Just one 
little look can’t hurt.” 

“How do you know the screen’s 
effective in the other direction?” 
Rawlins frowned. “I never consid- 
ered that. We haven’t tried to go 
outward through the maze yet. Sup- 
pose it’s altogether different coming 
out? We don’t have charts for that 
direction. What if we all get clip- 
ped coming out?” 

“We’ll use the probes again,” said 
Boardman. “Don’t worry about that. 
When we’re ready to go out, 
we’ll bring a bunch of drones to the 
camp in Zone F here, and check the 
exit route the same way we checked 
the entry route.” 

After a while Rawlins said, “Why 
should there be any traps on the out- 
ward route, anyway? That means the 
builders of the maze were locking 
themselves in as well as locking 



enemies out. Why would they do 
that?” 

“Who knows, Ned? They were 
aliens.” 

XIII 

B oardman remembered that the 
conversation was incomplete. He 
said, “And which had been the worst 
place for you so far?” 

“That other screen further back,” 
Rawlins said. “The one that shows 
you all the nasty, crawling stuff in- 
side your own mind.” 

“Wiich screen is that?” 

“Toward the inside of Zone H. 
It was a golden screen fastened to a 
high wall with metal strips. I looked 
at it and saw my father, for a cou- 
ple of seconds, and then I saw a girl 
I once knew, a girl who became a 
nun. On the screen she was taking 
her clothes off.” 

“I didn’t see any such things.” 

“You couldn’t miss it. It was, oh, 
about fifty meters after the place 
where you shot the first animal. A 
little to your left, halfway up the 
wall, a rectangular screen, a trape- 
zoidal screen, really, with bright 
white metal borders, and colors mov- 
ing on it, shapes — ” 

“Yes. That one. Geometrical 
shapes.” 

“I saw Maribeth getting undress- 
ed,” Rawlins said, sounding confus- 
ed. “And you saw geometrical 
shapes?” 

Zone F could be deadly too. A 
small pearly blister in the ground 
opened, and a stream of gleaming 
pellets rolled out. They flowed 
toward Rawlins. They moved with 



TrtE MAN IN THE MAZE 



53 




the malevolent determination of a 
stream of hungry soldier ants. They 
stung the flesh. He trampled a num- 
ber of them, but in his annoyance 
and fervor he almost came too close 
to a suddenly flashing blue light. He 
kicked three pellets toward the light, 
and they melted. 

Boardman had already had much 
more than enough. 

Their elapsed time out from the 
entrance to the maze was only one 
hour and forty-eight minutes, al- 
though it seemed much longer than 
that^ The route through Zone F led 
into a pink-walled room where jets 
of steam blew up from concealed 
vents. At the far end of the room 
was an irising slot. If you did not step 
through it with perfect timing, you 
would be crushed. The slot gave ac- 
cess to a long low-vaulted passage- 
way, oppressively war mand close, 
whose walls were blood-red in color 
and pulsated skkeningly. Beyond the 
passageway was an open plaza in 
which six slabs of white metal stood 
on end like waiting swords. A foun- 
tain hurled water a hundred meters 
in the air. Flanking the plaza were 
three towers with many windows, all 
of different sizes. Prismatic spotlights 
played against the windows. No win- 
dows were broken. On the steps of 
one of the towers lay the articulated 
skeleton of a creature close to ten 
meters long. The bubble of what 
was undoubtedly a space helmet 
covered its skull. 

A lton, Antonelli, Cameron, Green- 
field and Stein constituted die 
Zone F camp, the relief base for the 
forward group. Antonelli and Stein 



went back to the plaza in the middle 
of F and found Rawlins and Board- 
man there. 

“It’s just a short way on,” Stein 
said. “Would you like to rest a few 
minutes, Mr. Boardman?” 

Boardman glowered. They went on. 

Antonelli said, “Davis, Ottavio 
and Reynolds passed on to E this 
morning when Alton, Cameron and 
Greenfield reached us. Petrocelli and 
Walker are reconnoitering along the 
inner edge of E and looking a little 
way into D. They say it looks a lot 
better in there.” 

The relief base consisted of a pair 
of extrusion domes side by side in a 
little open spot at the edge of a 
garden. The site had been thoroughly 
researched and no surprises were ex- 
pected. Rawlins entered one of the 
domes and took his shoes off. Camer- 
on handed him a cleanser. Greenfield 
gave him a food pack. 

Boardman came into the dome. It 
amazed Rawlins how durable and 
tireless the old man was. Boardman 
said, laughing, ‘Tell Captain Hos- 
teen he lost his bet. We made it.” 

“What bet?” asked Antonelli. 

Greenfield said, “We think that 
Muller must be tracking us some- 
how. His movements have been very 
regular. He’s occupying the back 
quadrant of Zone A, as far from the 
entrance as possible, if the entrance 
is the one he uses, and he swings 
around in a little arc balancing the 
advance party.” 

Boardman said, “Hosteen gave 
three to one we wouldn’t get here. I 
heard him.” To Cameron, who was 
a communications technician, Board- 
man said, “Do you think it’s possible 



54 



IF 




that Muller is using some kind of 
scanning system?” 

“It’s altogether likely.” 

“Good enough to see faces?” 
“Maybe some of the time. We 
really can’t be sure. He’s had a lot 
of time to learn how to use this maze, 
sir.” 

“If he sees my face,” said Board- 
man, “we might as well just go home 
without bothering. I never thought 
he might be scanning us. Who’s got 
the thermoplastics? I need a new 
face fast.” 

He did not try to explain. But 
when he was finished he had a long 
sharp nose, lean, downcurving lips, 
and a witch’s chin. It was not an 
attractive face. But it was not the 
face of Charles Boardman, either. 

A fter a night of unsound sleep 
Rawlins prepared himself to go 
on to the advance camp in Zone E. 
Boardman would not be going with 
him, but they would be in direct 
contact at all times now. Boardman 
would see what Rawlins saw and 
hear what Rawlins heard. And in a 
tiny voice Boardman would be able 
to convey instructions to him. 

The morning was dry and wintry. 
They tested the communications cir- 
cuits. Rawlins stepped out of the 
dome and walked ten paces, standing 
alone looking inward and watching 
the orange glow of daylight on the 
pockmarked porcelain-like walls be- 
fore him. The walls were deep black 
against the lustrous green of the 
sky. 

Boardman said, “Lift your right 
hand if you hear me, Ned.” 

Rawlins lifted his right hand. 



“Now go ahead and speak to me.” 
“Where did you say Richard Mul- 
ler was bom?” 

“On Earth. I hear you very well.” 
“Where on Earth?” 

“The North American Directorate, 
somewhere.” 

“I’m from there,” Rawlins said. 
“Yes, I know. I think Muller is 
from the western part of the con- 
tinent.” 

“Should I get started now?” 
“Listen to me, first. We’ve been 
very busy getting ourselves inside this 
place, and I don’t want you to forget 
that everything we’ve done up to 
this point has been a preliminary to 
our real purpose. We’re here for 
Muller, remember.” 

“Would I forget?” 

“We’ve been preoccupied with 
matters of personal survival. That 
can tend to blur your perspective; 
whether you yourself, individual in- 
dividual, live or die. Now we take a 
larger view. What Richard Muller 
has whether it’s a gift or a curse, is 
of high potential value; and it’s your 
job to gain use of it, Ned. The fate 
of galaxies lies on what happens in 
the next few days between you and 
Muller. Eons will be reshaped. Bil- 
lions yet unborn will have their lives 
altered for good or ill by the events 
at hand.” 

“You sound absolutely serious, 
Charles.” 

“I absolutely am. Sometimes there 
comes a moment when all the boom- 
ing foolish inflated words mean 
something, and this is one of those 
moments. You’re standing at a cross- 
roads in galactic history. And there- 
fore, Ned, you’re going to go in 



THE MAN IN THE MAZE 



55 




there and lie and cheat and perjure 
and connive, and 1 expect that your 
conscience is going to be very sore 
for a while, and you’ll hate yourself 
extravagantly for it, and eventually 
you’ll re^e that you’ve done a deed 
of heroism. The test of your com- 
munications equipment is now ended. 
Get back inside here and let’s ready 
you to march.” 

H e went alone only a short dis- 
tance this time. Stein and Alton 
accompanied him as far as the gate- 
way to Zone E. There were no inci- 
dents. They pointed him in the right 
direction, and he passed through a 
pinwheeling shower of coruscating 
azure sparks to enter the austere, fun- 
eral zone beyond. As he negotiated 
the uphill ramp of the entrance he 
caught sight of a socket mounted in 
an upright stone cdumn. Within the 
darkness of the socket was something 
mobile and gleaming that could have 
been an eye. 

“I think I’ve found part of Muller’s 
scanning system,” Rawlins reported. 
“There’s a thing watching me in the 
wall.” 

“Cover it with your spray,?’ Board- 
man suggested. 

“I think he’d interpret that as a 
hostile act. Why would an archeolo- 
gist mutilate a feature like that?” 
“Yes. A point. Proceed.” 

There was less of an air of men- 
ace about Zone E. It was made up 
of dark, tightly compacted low build- 
ings that clung together like bother- 
ed turtles; Rawlins could see different 
topography ahead, high walls and a 
shining tower. Each of the zones 
was so different from all the others 



that he began to think they h^ been 
built at different times: a core of 
residential sectors, and then a gradual 
accretion of trap-laden outer rings 
as the enemies grew more trouble- 
some. It was the sort of thought an 
archeologist might have; he Bled it 
for use. 

He walked a little way and saw the 
shadowy figure of Walker coming 
toward him. Walker was lean, dour, 
cool. He was about forty, a career 
man. 

“Glad you made it, Rawlins. Go 
easy there on your left. That wall is 
hinged.” 

“Everything all right here?” 

“More or less. We lost Petrocelli 
about an hour ago.” 

Rawlins stiffened. “This zone is 
supposed to be safe!” 

“It isn’t. It’s riskier than F, and 
nearly as bad as G. We underesti- 
mated it when we were using the 
probes. There’s no real reason why 
the zones have to get safer toward 
the middle, is there? This is one of 
the worst.” 

‘To lull us,” Rawlins suggested. 
“False security.” 

“You bet Come on, now. Follow 
me and don’t use your brain too 
much. There’s no value in originality 
in here. You go the way the path 
goes, or you don’t go anywhere.” 

Rawlins fdlowed. He saw no ap- 
parent danger, but he jumped where 
Walker jumped, and he detoured 
where Walker detoured. Not too far 
on lay the inner camp. He found 
Davis, Ottavio, and Reynolds there, 
and also the upper half of Petro- 
celli. 

“You going on into D today?” 

IF 



56 




Walker asked with a keen interest.” 
“I may as well.” 

“We’ll tell you what to avoid. It’s 
new. That’s where Petrocelli got it, 
right near the entrance to D, maybe 
five meters this side. You trip a field 
of some kind and it cuts you in half. 
The drones didn’t trip it at all.” 
“Suppose it cuts ever5rthing in half 
that goes by?” Rawlins asked. “Ex- 
cept drones.” 

“It didn’t cut Muller,” Walker 
said. “It won’t cut you if you step 
around it. We’ll show you how.” 
“And beyond?” 

“That’s all up to you.” 

B oardman said, “If you’re tired, 
stay here for the night.” 

“I’d rather go on.” 

“You’ll be going alone, Ned. Why 
not be rested?” 

“Ask the brain for a reading on 
me. See where my fatigue level is. I’m 
ready to go onward.” 



Boardman checked. They were do- 
ing full telemetry on Rawlins; they 
knew his pulse rate, respiration count, 
hormone levels and many more inti- 
mate things. The computer saw no 
reason why Rawlins could not contin- 
ue without pausing. 

“All right,” said Boardman. “Go 
on.” 

“Fm about to enter Zone D, Char- 
les. This is where Petrocelli got it. I 
see the tripline — very subtle, very 
well hidden. Here I go past it. Yes. 
Ye-es. This is Zone D. I’m stopping 
and letting the brain get my bearings 
for me. Zone D looks a little cozier 
than E. The crossing shouldn’t take 
long.” 

Auburn flames guarded Zone C. 
They were frauds. 

Rawlins said softly, “Tell the 
galaxies that their fate is in good 
hands. I should find Muller in fifteen 
minutes.”

New York, New York 
FROM: Edward Salant 

August 19 

On April 5 of this year I purchased 
from your company a Phonotyper 
model 519. Since I know you will 
be interested in such matters, I have 
gone to the trouble of finding the ser- 
ial number of my particular unit, 
which is B-8954-01-901. 

Finding this number was in itself 
no small feat. Indeed it took me well 
over twenty minutes, by the end of 
which I was in downright intimate 
terms with your machine. However, 



this is irrelevant. Annoying, but ir- 
relevant. 

I have found the Phonotyper to be 
an extremely useful piece of equip- 
ment. Since I write for a living, I am 
most happy to be freed from the 
idiosyncrasies of my old electric type- 
writer (a machine which fought me 
at all turns.) Now it is a joy to settle 
myself in a comfortable chair with 
my feet up and speak into tht Phono- 
typer microphone. I love the little 
happy hum that comes from the next 
room as the transcriber puts down 
my words at the incredible rate of 27 
characters per second. I only wish I 
could express myself as fast as your 
machine can type the words.

AN IF FIRST 

Each month If brings you a new 
writer, never before published. This 
month's is Jerry Juhl, a 29-year-old 
New Yorker who began his career as 
a puppeteer with a TV program in 
California and is now writer and pup- 
peteer with The Muppets, the macabre 
stick-and-string comedians that have 
brightened network television shows for 
the past few years. A graduate of San 
Jose State College, Juhl is in Europe 
as this is written but will be back soon 
with The Muppets — and, we hope, 
with usi 



However, there Is a fly in the oint- 
ment — or possibly in the silicone 
lubricant. After about three months 
of use, the Phonotyper began playing 
games with me. Occasionally it would 
slip in a “then” when I had said 
“than.” Or, when it thought I wasn’t 
watching, it would turn one of my 
“shoulds” into a “would.” This latter 
example actually occured in an im- 
portant business letter, and since the 
mistake was not caught, it caused no 
end of trouble. 

I have had one of your service- 
men call twice. Each time he vowed 
the trouble had been corrected, but 
each time it wasn’t. 

I am writing this with the hope 
that you might have something con- 
structive to suggest.

Dear Mr. Salant: 

We have received your letter of 
August 19. 

We deeply regret that you have 
had difficulty with your Phonotyper 
519. 

The 519 is the product of over 
fifteen years’ research by a company 
well known for its fine business 
equipment. Still, it is a new machine, 
based on new and radically different 
concepts in the fields of electronic 
and mechanical engineering. Because 
of this, a certain amount of adjust- 
ment is sometimes necessary for the 
unit to function flawlessly. 

We suggest that the problem may 
be a phonetic one. Remember that 
each Phonotyper must be set to the 
personal speech patterns and regional 
dialect of its user. 

We therefore recommend that you 
refer to the new revised and expanded 
instruction manual which is enclosed. 
With this, you should be able to make 
the necessary adjustment for your 
personal local patterns. 

If you have any further questions, 
please feel free to contact us. 
Sincerely, 

The American 
Business Equipment, 
Inc.

THE EDWARD SALANT LEHERS

TO: American Business 
Equipment, Inc. 

FROM: Edward Salant 

September 1 

Thank you for your courteous let- 
ter of August 25. I was pleased to 
receive the new expanded instruction 
manual. 

I must tell you that at first I was 
skeptical of your advice. Because I 
am a playwright, I have had training 
in all the theatrical arts, including 
several years of exhaustive work in 
voice and diction. My middle o is 
flawless, my internal vowels superb, 
and I’m ’extremely precise with frica- 
tives and plosives. In short I have 
perfect Standard American Speech. 
Or so I was told by the teaching 
machines. 

However, you must certainly know 
your business and your machines. 
And I am willing to admit that years 
of comfortable living may just possi- 
bly have dulled my laryngeal control 
a bit. Therefore, I tackled your in- 
struction book with a will. 

In fact, I read it several times over. 
For,;^while I was of the opinion that 
the computer that compiled this man- 
ual had done so by making up in- 
structions at random and arranging 
them according to the throw of some 
kind of electronic dice. But after the 
fourth reading, a sort of murky 
though undeniable logic began to 
emerge. 

In a mere four hours, I had my 
Phonotyper adjusted exactly as in- 
dicated. 

Tlie damn thing still doesn’t work. 

Please advise. 

Sincerely, 

Edward Salant

Dear Mr. Salant: 

We extend profuse apologies for 
the trouble you have incurred in us-

We have notified our St. Louis

They will be contacting you person- 
ally within the week.

You will be pleased to know that 
your service center in St. Louis 
functions with great efficiency. They 
did in fact contact me the day after 
your letter arrived. 

Perhaps I had neglected to tell you 
(although the carbon copies of my 
previous communiques seem to indi- 
cate differently) that I had already 
contacted your service center here, 
and they couldn’t help. They still 
can’t. 

The serviceman who called was the 
same one who had paid two previous 
visits. This time his batteries were so 
worn down he could hardly function 
at all. For your reference he is Robo- 
serv 30961. And while you’re charg-

ing him up, I’d have the poor chapes 
circuits checked, because after he left 
my Phonotyper worked more errati- 
cally than ever. 

I am writing this letter on my old 
electric typewriter. I loathe my old 
electric typewriter, as you may know 
by now. After all, we’ve become reg- 
ular pen pals in the last few weeks. 

I can only hope that somewhere in 
your little transistor-driven heart you 
will find the compassion to help. Is 
that too much to ask of a machine? 
Hopefully,

Oh, little letter-writing machine at

have you forgotten me? Is it some-

I know of course that this letter, 
like the others I have sent you, will 
be read by a machine. So I suppose 
it is senseless to try to describe to 
you an honest human emotion. Still, 
I feel impelled to try. The particular 
emotion I have in mind is rage. 

For nearly a month now I have 
had in my possession a totally in- 
operative Phonotyper model 519. All 

THE EDWARD SALANT LEHERS 



my efforts to have the machine r^ 
paired have come to naught. I have 
wheedled, cajoled, begged and plead-^ 
ed. I have used courtesy, sarcasm and 
righteous indignation. This mommg, 
determined to make one last try, 
telephoned your New York head- 
quarters. Now friends, all I really 
hoped for was to speak to s(»neose. 
Someone. Not something. 

First your answering machine an- 
swered, and when I explained my 
problem I was connected to another 
answering machine which listened 
politely and then decided to let me 
speak to yet a third. This third bit 
of solid-state circuitry was even nmre 
fawningly gracious than the other 
two. I am sure that if one were to 
watch this machine in action, one 
would see the little crystal diodes 
curtseying. After it had listened ever 
so patiently to my story, its charming 
little t^>ed voice soothed my fevered 
mind with promises of immediate 
help. Then it put me on “h<rfd” and 
left me there. Surely, I thought to 
myself as the long-^stance minutes 
ticked by, surely there must be some- 
body at the American Business 
Equipment Company. There must be 
a human being somewhere there. I 
was willing to talk to anyone — the 
man who swept up, or the man who 
drops by once a week to collect tile 
money. Anyone at all. 

It was at this point that the ma- 
chine disconnected me, and I was left 
like an idiot listening to the dial tone. 

Well, American Business Equip., 
ol’ buddy, I have decided on a course 
of action. If my Phonotyper isn’t 
working in a week’s time. I’ll take 
care of it myself. I shall place the 

ei 




machine in my car and drive to your 
St. Louis Service Center. There I 
shall smash the bloody thing to bits 
by hurling it through your lousy 
showroom window! 

Yours in rage, 

Edward Salant

Dear Mr. Salant: 

Please excuse our tardiness in an- 
swering your letters. This delay has 
been caused by certain discrepancies 
in the information which we find in 
our memory banks. Our St. Louis 
service center claims that they have 
never sent a repairman to service 
your machine. They were in tele- 
phone communication with you after 
we notified them of your problem. 
But the address which you gave them 
proved to be a non-existent one. Sub- 
sequent attempts to reach you by tele- 
phone failed, as you seemed not to 
be at .liome. This information does 
not jibe with the account you gave 
us m your letter of September 11. 
Possibly the problem can be traced 
to an error in our memory banks, but 
as you know this is highly unlikely. 

Also, our records show that the 
particular Phonotyper that you men- 
tioned, Serial No. B-8954-0 1-901, be- 
longs not to you but to Ailsworth 
Robotronics, of St. Louis. Is it possi- 
ble' that you purchased the unit from 



them second-hand and neglected to 
change the registration? 

We eagerly await your reply so 
that we may best serve you.

anything — the name of the 
originator of the message was Ter- 
-raiiJ enough, Anglo-Terran at that. 
^William Smith. And after that pro- 
isaic appellation there was his title. 
& But that was odd. It was not the 
^usual Master, Captain, Officer Com- 
manding or whatever. It was, plainly 
and simply, Rector. 

Piety .... Rector .... That 
ship’s name, and that title of rank, 
had an archaic ring to them. Grimes 
had always been a student of naval 
history and probably knew more 
about the vessels that had sailed 
Earth’s oceans in the dim and dis- 
tant past than anybody on the Rim 
Worlds and, come to that, the vast 
majority of people on the Home 
Planet itself. He remembered that 
most of the ancient sailing ships had 
been given religious names. He re- 
membered, too, that Rector had 
once been the shipmaster’s official 
tide. 

So what was this coming out to 
the Rim, giving her E.T.A., details 
of - last clearance, state of health on 
board and all the rest of it? Some 
cog, some caravel, some galleass? 
Grimes smiled at his own fancy. 
Nonetheless, strange ships, very 
strange ships, had drifted out to the 
Rim. 

“Miss Walton,” he said. 

“Yes, Commodore,” she replied 
brightly. 

' “This Piety. See what details 
Lloyds’ Register has on her.” 

' “Very good, sir.” 

The commodore — rugged, stocky, 
short, iron-gray hair over a deeply 
tanned and seamed face, ears that 
in spite of suggestions made by 



two wives and several mistresses still 
protruded — paced the polished floor 
of his office vdiile the little blonde 
punched the buttons that would actu- 
ate the Port Forlorn robot librarian. 
Legally, he supposed, the impending 
arrival of this Piety was the Port 
Captain’s pigeon. Grimes was Astro- 
nautical Superintendent of Rim Run- 
ners, the Confederacy’s shipping line. 
But also he was the Officer Com- 
manding the Rim Worlds Naval Re- 
serve and, as such, was concerned 
with matters of security and defense. 
He wished that Sonya, his wife, were 
available so that he could talk things 
over with her. Before her marriage 
to him, she had held the rank of 
Commander in the Intelligence 
Branch of the Interstellar Federa- 
tion’s Survey Service and, when it 
came to mysteries and secrets of any 
kind, displayed the aptitudes of a 
highly intelligent ferret. But Sonya, 
after declaring that another week on 
Lorn would have her climbing up 
the wallpaper, had taken off for a 
long vacation — Waverley, Caribbea, 
Atlantia and points inward — by 
herself. When she returned, she, 
would be sorry to have missed what- 
ever odd adventures the arrival of 
this queerly named ship presaged — 
and Grimes knew that Aere would 
be some. His premonitions were rare- 
ly, if ever, wrong. 

He turned away from the banked 
screens and instruments that made his 
office look like an exceptionally well 
fitted spaceship’s control room, walk- 
ed to the wide window that took up 
an entire wall, that overlooked the 
port. 

It was a fine day — for Lorn. The 

IP 



64 




almost perpetual overcast was thin 
enough to permit a hint of blue sky 
to show through, and the Lorn sun 
was a clearly defined disk rather 
than the usual fuzzy balL There was 
almost no wind* Discharge of Rim 
Leopard, Grimes noted, seemed to be 
progressing satisfactorily. There was 
blue flare of welding arcs about the 
little spacetug, Rim Mamelute, pre- 
sently undergoing her annual survey. 
And there, all by herself, was the 
ship that Crimes — to the annoyance 
of his wife — often referred to as 
his one true love, the old, battered 
Faraway Quest, She had been built 
how many (too many) years ago as 
a standard Epsilon Class tramp for 
the Interstellar Transport Commis- 
sion. She had been converted into a 
survey diip for the Rim Worlds 
Government. In her. Grimes had 
made the first landings on the in- 
habited planets to the Galactic East, 
the worlds now referred to as the 
Eastern Circuit. In her he had made 
the first contact — but not a physi- 
cal one — with the anti-matter sys- 
tems to the Galactic West. 

And would the arrival of the good 
ship Piety lead to her recommission- 
ing? Grimes hoped so. He liked his 
job; it was interesting work, carrying 
both authority and responsibility. But 
he was often tired of being a desk- 
borne commodore and had always 
welcomed the chance to take the 
old Quest up and out into deep space 
again. As often in the past he had a 
hunch, a strong one. {^mething was 
cooking. He’d have a finger in the pie. 

Miss Walton’s childish treble broke 
into his thou^ts. “Sir, I have the in- 
formation on Piety. 



“Yes? Come on, girl, let’s have k.” 
“She was built as Epsilon Cmcis 
for the Interstellar Transport Oq&h 
mission fifty Terran Standard Years 
ago. She was purchased from them 
last year, Terran reckoning, by the 
Skarsten Theological Institute, whose 
address is listed as Nuevo Angeles on 
Francisco, otherwise known as Beta 
Puppis VL” 

“I’ve visited Francisco,” he told 
her. “A pleasant world, in many 
ways. But an odd one.” 

“Odd? How, sir?” 

“I hope I’m not treading on any 
of your corns, Miss Walton, but the 
whole planet’s no more than a breeds 
ing ground for fancy religions.” 

“I’m a Latter Day Reformed Meth- 
odist myself, sir,” she told him 
severely. “That’s not fancy.” 

“Indeed it’s not. Miss Walton,” 
And I’m a cynical, more or less 
tolerant agnostic, he thought. He 
went on, “And do Lloyds’ condes- 
cend to tell us the category in whidi 
this renamed Epsilon Crucis is now 
listed? A missionary ship, perhaps?” 
“No, sir. A survey ship.” 

“Oh” was all that Grimes could 
say. 

T wo days later, from his office 
window. Grimes watched Piety 
come in. Whatever else this Rector 
William Smith might or might not 
be he was a good ship handler. 
There was a nasty wind blowing 
across the spaceport, not quite a gale, 
but near enough to it; nonetheless the 
ship made a classic vertical descent, 
dropping to the exact center of the 
triangle formed by the berth marker 
beacons. It was easy enough in 



THE RIM GODS 



65 




theory, no more than the exact ap- 
plication of lateral thrust, no more 
than a sure and steady hand on the 
remote controls of the Inertial Drive. 
No more — and no less. Some peo- 
ple get the feel of ships; some never 
do. 

This Piety was almost a twin to 
Grimes’s own Faraway Quest. She 
was a newer (less old) ship, of course, 
but the design of the Epsilon Class 
tramps, those trusty workhorses of 
the Commission, changes very little 
over the years. She sat there in her 
assigned berth, a gray, weathered 
spire, the bright scarlet beacons still 
blinking way just clear of the broad 
vanes of her tripedal landing gear. 
From her stem a telescopic mast ex- 
tended itself, and from the top of 
the metal staff a flag broke out, 
whipped to quivering rigidity by the 
wind. 

The commodore picked up his 
binoculars to study it. It was not, 
as he had thought that it would 
be, the national ensign of Francisco, 
golden crux ansata and crescent on a 
scarlet ground; even with the naked 
eye he could see that. It was a harsh- 
ly uncompromising standard — a 
simple white cross on a black field. 
It must be, decided Grimes, the 
houseflag of the Skarsten Institute. 

The after airlock door opened and 
the ramp extended from it, and to it 
drew up the beetlelike cars of the 
various port officials — Port Cap- 
tain, Customs, Immigration, Health. 
The boarding party got out of their 
vehicles and filed up the gangway, 
to where an officer was waiting to 
receive them. They vanished into the 
ship. Grimes idly wondered whether 



or not they would get a drink and 
what the views of these Skarsten 
people were on alcohol. He remem- 
bered his own visit to Francisco, as a 
junior officer in the Federation’s 
Survey Service, many years ago. 
Some of the religious sects had been 
rigidly abstemious, maintaining that 
alcohol was an invention of the 
devil. Others had held that wine sym- 
bolized the more beneficent aspects 
of the Almighty. But it was hardly a 
subject worthy of speculation. He 
would find out for himself when, at 
some time when the arrive formali- 
ties were over, he paid his courtesy 
call on the ship’s captain. 

He went back to his desk, busied 
himself with the paper work that 
made a a habit of accumulating. An 
hour or so later he was interrupted 
by the buzzing of his telephone. 
“Grimes here!” he barked into the 
instrument. 

“Commodore Grimes,” said a 
strange voice. It ,was a statement 
rather than a question. “This is 
William Smith, Commodore, Rector 
of Piety. I request an appointment.” 

“It will be my pleasure, er. Rec- 
tor.” Grimes glanced at his watch. 
It was almost time for his rather 
dreary coffee and sandwich lunch. 
It was not the sort of meal that one 
asked visitors to share. He said, 
“Shall we say 1400 hours, our time? 
In my office?” 

“That will do very nicely, sir. 
Thank you.” 

“I am looking forward to meeting 
you,” said Grimes, replacing the 
handset in its rest. And shall I send 
Miss Walton out for some sacramen- 
tal wine? he asked himself.

W illiam Smith was a tall man, 
thin, with almost all of his 
pale face Wdden by a bushy black 
beard, from above which a great 
nose jutted like the beak of a bird 
of prey. His eyes under the thick, 
black brows were of a gray so pale 
as to be almost colorless, and they 
were cold, cold. A plain black uni- 
form covered his spare frame, the 
buttons concealed by the fly front of 
the tunic, the four bands o'f black 
braid on the sleeves almost invisible 
against the cloth. There was a hint 
of white lace at his throat 

“I have been told, sir,” he said, 
sitting rigidly in his chair, “that you 
are something of an expert on the 
queer conditions that prevail here, on 
the Rim.” 

“Perhaps, Rector,” said Grimes, 
“you will teU me first the purpose of 
your visit here.” 

“Very well, sir.” The man’s bari- 
tone voice was as cold and as color- 
less as his eyes. “To begin with, we 
have the permission of your govern- 
ment, your Rim Worlds Confederacy, 
a conduct our survey on certain of 
the planets under your jurisdiction.” 
“A survey. Rector? The Rim 
Worlds have been very well surveyed 
— even though I say it myself.” 

“Not our kind of survey. Commo- 
dore. I shall, as you would say, put 
you in the picture. We of the Skarsten 
Institute are Neo Calvinists. We de- 
plore the godlessness, the heresy that 
is ever more prevalent throughout 
the galaxy — yes, even upon our 
own planet We feel that Mankind 
is in sore and pressing need of a new 
Revelation, a new Sinai . .” 

“And you honestly believe that you 



will find your Sinai here, out on 
the Rim?” 

“We believe that we shall find 
our Sinai. If not here, then elsewhere. ^ 
Perhaps even beyond the confines of 
this galaxy.” 

“Indeed? But how can 1 help you. 
Rector?” 

“You, we were told, know more 
about the odd distortions of the Con- 
tinuum encountered here than any- 
body else on these planets.” 

“Such is fame.” Grimes sighed and 
shrugged. “Very well. Rector, you 
asked for it. 1*11 tell you what little 
I know. To begin with, it is thought 
by many of our scientists that here, 
at the very edge of the expanding 
galaxy, the fabric of time and space 
is stretched thin. We have long be- 
come used to the phenomena known 
as Rim Ghosts, disconcerting glimpses 
into alternative universes — ” 

“I believe that you, sir, have per- 
sonally actually made the transition 
into these universes.” 

“Yes. Once when the Federation’s 
Survey Service requested our aid in 
the investigation of the Riin Ghost 
phenomena. No doubt your people 
have read the Survey Service report.” 
‘We have.” 

“The second time was when we 
of the Confederacy took our own 
steps to deal with what we decided 
was a very real menace — an alter- 
native universe in which our worlds 
were ruled by particularly unpleasant 
mutants, with human beings in a state 
of slavery. And then there was Cap- 
tain Listowel, who was Master of the 
first, experimental lightjammer. He 
tried to exceed the speed of light 
without cheating — as we do with our 



THE RIM GODS 



67 




Mannschenn Drive — and experi- 
enced quite a few different time 
tracks.” 

“And tell me, sir, did you or this 
Captain Listowd ever feel that you 
were on the point of being granted 
the Ultimate Revelation?” 

“Frankly, no, Rector. We had our 
bad moments — as who in Space, or 
anywhere else, doesn’t? And anyone 
who has indulged in time-track 
switching often wonders, as I do, 
about the reality, the permanence of 
both himself and the universe about 
him. For example, I have vague 
memories of ships that were equipped 
with only reaction drive for blast- 
offs and landings and short inter- 
planetary hauls. Absurd, isn’t it? But 
those memories are there. And my 
wife — I’m sorry you can’t meet 
her, but she’s off on a trip — seems 
to have changed. I have this half 
recollection of her when she first 
came out to the Rim, which is there 
in my mind alongside the real — but 
what is real? — one. She was work- 
ing for the Federation’s Intelligence 
Service then. Anyhow in one memory 
riie’s small and blonde, in one she’s 
tall and blonde, and in one she’s tall 
and red-headed, as she is today. 
Damn it — that’s three memories!” 

“Women have been known to 
change their hair styles and colora- 
tions, Commodore.” 

‘Too right. I shan’t be at all sur- 
prised if she returns with her crown- 
ing glory a bright green! But that 
doesn’t explain the co-existent memo- 
ries.” 

“Perhaps not.” Smith’s voice was 
bitter as he went on, “But it seems 
such a waste of opportunities. To 



have been privileged to visit the 
many mansions of our Father’s house, 
and to come back only with confused 
recollections of the color of a 
woman’s hair!” 

“And quite a few scars. Rector. 
Physical and psychological.” 

“No doubt.” The man’s voice was 
unpleasantly ironic. “But tell me, sir, 
what do you know of Kinsolving’s 
Planet?” 

“Not much. I suppose that we 
shall settle it if we’re ever faced with 
a population explosion, which is 
doubtful.” 

“I am referring, sir, to the man 
who appeared there, the Stone Age 
savage from the remote past.” 

“Yes, that was a queer business. 
Well before my time. Nothing of the 
kind has happened there in recent 
years, although there is still an un- 
easy, brooding atmosphere about that 
world that makes it undesirable as a 
piece of real estate. The original 
theory is that somehow the . the 
loneliness of the people out here on 
the Rim, hanging, as it were, by their 
fingernails over the abyss of the Ulti- 
mate Night, became focused on that 
one particular planet. Now the theory 
is that there the fabric of time and 
space is stretched extremely thin and 
that anything or anybody is liable to 
fall through, either way. The rock 
paintings are still there in the caves. 
But there haven’t been any new ones 
and the paint is never wet any 
more.” 

“The Stone Age savage,” said 
Smith, “eventually became a Fran- 
ciscan citizen, and a Neo Calvinist. 
He died at a very ripe old age, and 
among his effects was the manu- 

IP

script of his life story. His great 
grand-daughter presented it to the In- 
stitute. It was thought, at first, that 
it was a work of fiction — but the 
surviving relatives insisted that it 
was not. And then I, when I made a 
voyage to Earth, was able to obtain 
access to the Survey Service rec- 
ords.” 

“And so?” asked Grimes. 

“So Kinsolving’s Planet is to be- 
come our New Sinai,” Smith told 
him. 



Y ou’d better go along. Grimes,” 
Admiral Kravitz told him, 
“just to see fair play. Anyhow, it’s 
all been arranged. You will be recall- 
ed to the active list — pay &c. as per 
regulations — and ship out in this 
Piety of theirs as Rim Worlds govern- 
ment observer.” 

“But why me, sir? If I were taking 
my own ship, if the old Quest were 
being recommissioned with myself in 
command, it’d be different. But I 
don’t like being a passenger.” 
“You’ll not be a passenger, Grimes. 
Captain — sorry. Rector — Smith 
has indicated that he’ll appreciate 
having you along as a sort of pilot.” 
“In a ship full of sky pilots — and 
myself a good agnostic!” He saw the 
bewildered expression on the ad- 
miral’s face and explained his choice 
of words. “In the old days, before 
there were any real sky pilots, sea- 
men used to refer to ministers of re- 
ligion as such.” 

“Did they now? And what would 
those tarry-breeked ruffians of 
whom you’re so fond have thought 
of a captain calling himself ‘rector?’ ” 
“In the early days of sail they’d 
have thought nothing of it. It was 
the master’s usual title.” 

“I doubt if anybody’ll ever call 
you ‘bishop,’ ” remarked the admiral. 
“Anyhow, you’ll be aboard primarily 
to observe. And to report In the 
unlikely event of anything occurring 
that will effect Rim Worlds security 
you are to take action.” 

“Me — and what squad of 
Marines?” 

“We could send a detachment of 







69 



the Salvation Army with you,” joked 
the admiral. 

“I doubt that they’d be allowed 
on board. As far as 1 can gather, 
these Neo Calvinists are somewhat 
intolerant. Only on a world as toler- 
ant as Francisco would they have 
been allowed to flourish.” 

“Intolerant, yes,” agreed Kravitz. 
“But scrupulously honest. And 
moral.” 

“In short,” said Grimes, “no re- 
deeming vices.” 

“P/e/y lifts ship at 1800 hours to- 
morrow, Commodore Grimes,” said 
the admiraL “You will be aboard.” 

“Aye, aye, sir,” replied Grimes re- 
signedly. 

Grimes had never enjoyed serving 
in a “taut ship” himself, and had 
never commanded one. Nonethe- 
less, he respected those captains who 
were able to engender about them- 
selves such a state of affairs. Piety, 
as was obvious from the moment 
that he set foot on the bottom of 
the ramp, was a taut ship. Everything 
was spotless. Every metal fitting and 
surface that was supposed to be 
polished boasted a mirrorlike sheen. 
All the paintwork looked as though it 
was washed at least twice daily — 
which, in fact, it was. The atmos- 
phere inside the hull bore none of 
the usual taints of cookery, tobacco 
smoke or — even though there was 
a mixed crew — women’s perfume. 
But it was too chilly, and the acridi- 
ty of some disinfectant made Grimes 
sneeze. 

The junior officer who met him 
at the head of the ramp showed him 
into the elevator cage at the foot of 
the axial shaft. Grimes thanked him 

70 



and assured the presumably young 
man — the full beard made it hard 
to determine his age — that he knew 
his way around this class of vessel. 

A captain, no matter what he 
calls himself or is called, is always 
accommodated as closely as possible 
to the center of control. The elevator 
worked smoothly, noiselessly, carry- 
ing the commodore speedily up to 
the deck just below the control room. 
There, as in his own Faraway Quest, 
was the semicircular suite of cabins. 
Over the door was a brass plate with 
the title, RECTOR. 

As Grimes approached this en- 
trance it slid open. Smith stood there 
and said formally, “Welcome aboard. 
Commodore.” 

“Thank you. Rector.” 

“Will you come in, sir?” 

There were other people in the 
day cabin — a tall, stout, white- 
headed and bearded man dressed in 
clothing that was very similar to 
Smith’s uniform, a woman in a long- 
sleeved, high-necked, ankle-length 
black dress, her hair completely cover- 
ed by a frilly white cap. They look- 
ed at Grimes, obviously disapproving 
of his gold-braided, brass-buttoned, 
beribboned finery. They did not get 
up. 

“Commodore Grimes,” said Smith. 
“Presbyter Cannan. Sister Lane.” 
Reluctantly the presbyter extended 
his hand. Grimes took it. He was 
not surprised that it was cold. Sister 
Lane nodded slightly in his general 
direction. 

Smith gestured stiffly toward a 
chair, sat down himself. Giimes low- 
ered himself to his own seat incau- 
tiously. He should have known that 

IF 





it would be hard. He looked curious- 
ly at the two civilians. The presb^er 
was an older edition of Rector Smith. 
The sister? She had him puzzled. She^ 
belonged to a type that had been* 
common enough on Francisco when 
he had been there — the Blossom 
People, they had called themselves. 
They preached and practiced a sort 
of hedonistic Zen and claimed that 
their use of the wide range of drugs 
avaiable to them put them in close 
communication with the Cosmic All. 
Prim she was, this Sister Lane, prim 
and proper in her form-concealing 
black, but the planes of her face 
were not harsh, and her unpainted 
lips were full, and there was a strange 
gentleness in her brown eyes.

Cannan, walked out of the door, “that it must be confusing to one

who relies upon gaudy fripperies for 
his authority rather than inner grace.” 

“Your baggage must be aboard and 
stowed by now. Commodore,” Smith 
said hastily. He turned to his spiritual 
superior. “May I suggest, sir, that you 
and your people retire to your quar- 
ters? Lift-off — ” he glanced at his 
watch — “will be in fifteen min- 
utes.” 

“Very well. Rector.” The old man 
got up, towering over the two space- 
men. Smith got up. Grimes remained 
seated until Smith returned from 
seeing the presbyter out. 

He said, “I’d better be getting be- 
low myself. If you could have some- 
body show me to my stateroom. Rec- 
tor.” 

“I was hoping. Commodore, that 
you would be coming up to control 
for the liftoff.” 

“Thank you. Rector Smith. It will 
be my pleasure.” 

. Smith led the way out of his quar- 
ters, up the short ladder that brought 
the two men to the control room. 
Grimes looked about him. The layout 
was a standard one — acceleration 
chairs before which were banks of 
instruments, screens, meters, chart 
tank, mass proximity indicator, Car- 
lotti Beacon direction finder .... 
All seemed to be in perfect order, 
and much of the equipment was new. 
Evidently the Skarsten Theological 
Institute did not believe in spoiling 
the ship for a*ha’porth of tar. 

The rector indicated a chair, into 
which Grimes strapped himself, then 
took his own seat. The officers were 
already at their stations. All these 
bearded men, thought the commo- 
dore, looked too much alike, and 



their black on black insigni;^ of rank 
made it hard to tell who was what. 
But this wasn’t his ship, and she had 
managed to come aU the way out 
from Francisco without mishap. 

The departure routine went 
smoothly enough, with the usual mes- 
sages exchanged between control 
room and spaceport control tower. 
The inertial drive started up, and 
there was that brief second of weight- 
lessness before the gentle accelera- 
tion made itself felt. The ship lifted 
easily, falling upward to the cloud 
ceiling. Briefly Grimes was able to 
look out through the viewports at 
Port Forlorn and at the dreary coun- 
tryside spread out around the city 
like a man. And then there was noth- 
ing but gray mist outside — mist 
that suddenly became a pearly, lu- 
minescent white and then vanished. 
Overhead was a steely sun glaring out 
of a black sky, its light harsh even 
though the ports were polarized. 

There was free fall for a little 
while, and then the gyroscopes swung 
the ship’s head to the target star. The 
inertial drive came on again, its ir- 
regular throbbing beat a bass back- 
ground for the thin, high keening of 
the Mannschenn Drive. Ahead, save 
for the iridescent spiral that was the 
target sun, there was only blackness. 
Lorn was to starboard — a vast, 
writhing planetary amoeba that was 
falling astern, that was shrinking 
rapidly. And out to port was the 
galactic lens, distorted by the tem- 
poral precession field of ^e drive to 
a Klein flask blown by a drunken 
glassblower. 

Grimes wondered, as he had won- 
dered before, if anybody would ever 

IP

come up with another simile. But 
this one was so apt 

m 

rimes didn’t like this ship. 

She was beautifully kept effici- 
ently run, and with her cargo spaces 
converted to passenger accommoda- 
tion she housed comfortably her crew 
and all the personnel from the Skar- 
sten Institute. But she was . cold. 
She was cold, and she was too 
quiet. 

There was none of the often ri- 
bald laughter, none of the snatches 
of light music that lent warmth to 
the atmosphere of a normal vessel. 
There were, he noted, paymasters 
in all the recreation rooms. But when 
he examined the spools of the ma- 
chine in the senior officers’ mess he 
found that they consisted entirely of 
recordings of sermons and the gloom- 
ier hymns. The library was as bad. 
And socially there was complete seg- 
regation of the sexes. Deaconesses 
and sisters were berthed aft, and be- 
tween them and the male crew and 
passengers were the storerooms and 
the “farm.” 

The food was not bad, but it was 
plain, unimaginative. And there was 
nothing to drink but water, and even 
that had a flat taste. The conversation 
at table was as boring as the pro- 
vender. Too, Grimes was annoyed to 
find out that the rector did not sit 
at the head of the board in the senior 
officers’ mess. That place of honor 
was reserved for the presbyter. And 
he talked, almost non-stop, about the 
Institute’s internal politics, with the 
ship’s captain interjecting an occasion- 



al quiet affirmative as required. Chief 
officer, surgeon and purser gobbled 
their meals in silence, as did Grimes, 
very much the outsider at the foot 
of the table. They were served by 
a young stewardess who would have 
been pretty in anything but that 
ugly, all-concealing black. She seemed 
to hold the domineering old man — 
but nobody else — in awe. 

After the evening meal Grimes 
made his excuses and retired to his 
cabin. It was little more than a dog- 
box and was a comedown after the 
suite to which he was accustomed 
aboard his own ship. He was pleased 
that he had brou^t his own reading 
matter with him and pleased that 
he had exercised the forethought to 
make provision for his other little 
comforts. Before doing anything else, 
he filled and lit his pipe. Then, 
moving slowly and easily through the 
blue haze of his own creation, he un- 
clipped the larger of his cases from 
its rack, pulled it out and opened it. 
He was lifting out the shirts that had 
acted as shockproof packing for cer- 
tain breakables when he heard a 
light tap at his door. 

He groaned. A passenger is bound 
by ship’s regulations as much as is 
any crew member. But he was damn- 
ed if he was going to put out his 
pipe. “Come in,” he called. 

She came in. She pulled the ugly 
white cap off her lustrous brown 
hair, tossed it on to the bunk. Then 
she turned back to the door, snapped 
i on the spring lock. She tested its 
security, smiled, then flopped down 
into the one chair that the cabin 
possessed. 

Grimes looked at her, with raised 




THE RIM GODS 



73 




eyebrows. “Yes, Sister Lane?” he 
asked. 

“Got a smoke, spaceman?” she 
growled. 

“There are some cigars — ” he be- 
gan doubtfully. 

“I didn’t expect pot. Although if 
you have any . .?” 

“I haven’t.” Then Grimes said 
virtuously, “In any case, such drugs 
are banned on the Rim Worlds.” 
“Are they? But what about the 
cigar you promised me?” 

Grimes got a box of panatellas 
out of his case, opened it, offered it 
to her. She took one, accepted his 
proff^ed light. She inhaled luxurious- 
ly. She said, “All I need now is a 
drink.” 

“I can supply that.” 

“Good on yer. Admiral!” 

There was the bottle of absolute 
alcohol, and there was the cabinet 
with its ranked phials of essences. 
“Scotch?” asked Grimes. “Rum? 
Brandy? Or • . ?” 

“Scotch will do.” 

The commodore measured alcohol 
into die two glasses over the wash- 
basin, added to each a drop of 
essence, topped up with cold water 
from the tap. She murmured, 
“Here’s mud in your eye,” and gulp- 
ed from hers as soon as he handed 
it to her. 

“Sister Lane,” said Grimes doubt- 
fully. 

“You can call me Clarisse.” 
“Oarisse. Should you be doing 
this?” 

“Don’t tell me that you’re a wow- 
ser, like all those Bible-punchers.” 
“I’m not. But this is not my 
ship — ” 

74 



“And it’s not mine, sir, either.” 
“Then what are you doing here?” 

4CTt’s a long story, dearie. And if 
A you ply me with licker, I might 
just tell it to you.” She sighed and 
stretched. “You’ve no idea what a re- 
lief it is to enjoy a drink and a talk 
and a smoke with somebody who’s 
more or less human.” 

“Thank you,” said Grimes stiffly. 
She laughed. “Don’t be offended, 
duckie.” She put up her hands, pulled 
her hair back and away from her 
face. “Look at my ears.” 

Grimes looked. They were normal 
enough organs — save for the fact 
that they were pointed, and were 
tufted with hair at the tips. 

“I’m only more or less human my- 
self,” she told him. “More rather 
than less, perhaps. You know about 
the man Raul, the caveman, the 
Stone Age savage, who was pulled, 
somehow, from the remote past on 
Kinsolving’s Planet to what was, 
then, the present. He was my great 
grandfather.” 

“He was humanoid,” said Grimes. 
“Not human.” 

“Human-schuman!” she mocked. 
“There is such a thing as parallel 
evolution, you know. And old Raul 
was made something of a pet by the 
scientists back on Earth. When he 
evinced the desire to father a family, 
the finest genetic engineers in the 
galaxy were pressed into service. No, 
not the way that you’re thinking. 
Commodore. You’ve got a low mind.” 
“Sorry.” 

“I should think so. Just for that, 
you can pour me another drink.” 
And would, Grimes asked himself. 



IF 




his liquor ration last out until his re- 
turn to Lorn? 

“What are you doing here?” he 
asked blundy. “In this ship?” 

“At this very moment I’m breaking 
at least 99% of the regulations laid 
down by the presbyter and enforced 
by the rector. But I know what you 
mean.” Her voice deepened so that 
it was like Grimes’s own. “What is 
nasty girl like you doing in a nice 
place like this?” 

“I shouldn’t call you nasty,” said 
Grimes. 

“Thank you, sir. Then stand by 
for the story of my life, complete 
and unexpurgated. I’ll start off with 
dear old great grand-daddy, the No- 
ble Savage. He was an artist, you 
know, in his proper place and time, 
one of those specialists who practiced 
a form of sympathetic magic. He 
would paint or draw pictures of var- 
ious animals, and the actual beasts 
would be drawn to the spot, there to 
be slaughtered by the hunters. He said 
that it worked, too. I can remember, 
when I was a little girl, that he’d put 
on demonstrations. He’d draw a pic- 
ture of, say, the cat — and within 
seconds pussy would be in the room. 
Oh, yes — and he was a telepath, a 
very powerful transceiver. 

“After many years on Earth — 
where he was latterly an instructor at 
the Rhine Institute — he emigrated, 
with his wife and children, to Fran- 
cisco, where he was psionic radio of- 
ficer in charge of the Port Diego sig- 
nal station. It was there that he got 
religion. And with all the religions 
to choose from, he had to become 
a Neo Calvinist! His family were 
converted with him. I often wonder 



how much part his undeniable psychic 
powers played in their conversion! 
And the wives of his sons had to 
become converts, and the husbands 
of his daughters — yea, even unto 
the third and fourth generations.” 
She grinned. “One member of the 
fourth generation kicked over the 
traces. Me. From the Neo Calvinists 
to the Blossom People was a logical 
step. Like most new converts I over- 
did things. Drinks, drugs, promiscuity 
— the works. The Neo Calvinists 
picked me up, literally, from the 
gutter and nursed me back to health 
in their sanitorium — and, at the 
same time, made it quite clear that if 
I was predestined to go to hell I 
should go there. And then, when they 
checked up on great grandfather’s 
autobiographical papers, they realized 
that I was predestined for something 
really important. Especially since I, 
alone of his descendants, possess 
something of his powers.” 

“You mean that you can . .?” 
There was a violent knocking on 
the door, and a voice shouting, “Open 
up! Open up, I say!” 

“They know I’m here,” muttered 
Clarisse Lane sullenly. She got out 
of her chair, operated the sliding 
panel herself. 

R ector Smith was standing outside. 

With him was a tall, gaunt 
woman. She stared at Sister Lane in 
horror and snarled, “Cover your 
nakedness, you shameless hussy!” 
Clarisse shrugged, picked up the 
ugly cap from where it was lying on 
the bunk and adjusted it over her 
hair, tucking all loose strands out of 
sight.

“Will you deal with Sister Lane, 
Deaconess?” asked Smith. 

“That I shall. Rector.” 

“Miss Lane and I were enjoying 
a friendly talk,” said Grimes. 

“A friendly talk!” The deaconess’s 
voice dipped scorn. “Smoking! Wine- 
bibbing! You . you gilded popin- 
jay!” 

Smith had picked up the bottle of 
alcohol, his obvious intention being 
to empty it into the washbasin. “Hold 
it!” said Grimes slowly and nastily. 
“Hold it!” 

Smith hesitated. Unhurriedly 
Grimes took the bottle from his hand, 
restoppered it, put it in the rack over 
the basin. 

Then the rector started to bluster. 
“Sir, I must remind you that you are 
a guest aboard my ship. A passenger. 
You are obliged to comply with 
ship’s regulations.” 

“Sir,” replied Grimes coldly, “I 
have signed no articles of agreement, 
and no ticket with the back covered 
with small print has been issued to 
me. I am surprised that a shipmaster 
should have been no neglectful of the 
essential legalities, and were you in 
the employ of the company of which 
I am astronautical superintendent I 
should find it my duty to reprimand 
you — ” 

“Not only a gilded popinjay,” ob- 
served the deaconess harshly, “but a 
space lawyer.” 

“Yes, madam, a space lawyer — 
as any master astronaut should be.” 
He was warming up nicely. “But I 
must remind both of you that I do 
have legal standing aboard this vessel. 
I am here in my capacity as official 
observer for the Rim Worlds Con- 



federacy. Furthermore, I was called 
back to active duty in the Rim 
Worlds Naval Reserve, with the rank 
of commodore.” 

“Meaningless titles,” sneered the 
deaconess. “A commodore without a 
fleet!” 

“Perhaps, madam. Perhaps. But I 
must remind you that we are proceed- 
ing through Rim Worlds territorial 
space. And I must make it plain that 
any interference with my own per- 
sonal liberties — and the infliction 
by yourselves of any harsh punish- 
ment on Miss Lane — will mean 
that Piety will be intercepted and 
seized by one of our warships.” He 
thought, / just hope the bluff isn*t 
called. 

Called it was. 

“And just how, Mr. Commodore 
Grimes, do you propose to call a 
warship to your aid?” asked the 
woman. 

“Easily, Deaconess, easily,” said 
Clarisse Lane. “Have you forgotten 
that I am a telepath — and a good 
one? Whilst this ship was on Lorn 
I made contact with a Mr. Mayhew, 
who is the senior psionic radio of- 
ficer of the Rim Worlds Navy. Even 
though we never met physically we 
became close friends. He is an old 
friend and shipmate of the commo- 
dore and asked me to keep in touch 
to let him know if Commodore 
Grimes were in any danger.” 

“And you will teU him, of course,” 
said Grimes, “if you are subjected 
to any harm or even to any dis- 
comfort” 

“He will knowy^ she said quietly. 

“Yes,” agreed Grimes. “He will 
know.” 



76 



IF 




H e was familiar with telepaths^ 
was Grimes, having commenced 
his space-faring career before the 
Carlotti direction-finding and com- 
munications system began to replace 
the psionic radio officers with its 
space- and time-twisting beamed ra- 
diations. He was familiar with tele- 
paths and knew how it was with 
them when, infrequently, one of them 
found a member of the opposite sex 
with the same talents attractive. Un- 
til this happened — and it rarely 
did — they would lavish all their af- 
fection on the disembodied canine 
brains that they used as amplifiers. 

Rector Smith was the first to weak- 
en. He muttered, “Very well. Com- 
modore.” 

“And is this harlot to go unpunish- 
ed?” flared the deaconess. 

‘Too right she is,” Grimes told 
her. 

She glared at him. Grimes glared 
back. He regretted deeply that this 
was not his ship, that he had no 
authority aboard her. 

“Rector Smith!” she appealed. 
*Tm sorry. Deaconess,” Smith told 
her. “But you have heard what these 
people have told us.” 

“And you will allow them to 
flout your authority?” 

“It is better than causing the 
success of our mission to be jeopar- 
dized.” He stiffened. “Furthermore, I 
order you not to lay hands upon 
Sister Lane and not to order any of 
the other sisters to do so.” 

“And I suppose she’s to be free to 
visit this . this vile seducer any 
time that she sees fit.” 

“No,” said Smith at last. “No. 
That I will not sanction. Commodore 



Grimes claims that I cannot 
orders to him — but my authority is 
still absolute insofar as all other per- 
sons aboard this vessel are concerned. 
Sister Lane will not be ill-treated. 
But she will be confined to the 
women’s quarters until such time as 
her services are required.” 

“The presbyter shall hear of this,” 
said the woman. 

“Indeed he shall. I shall be making 
my own report to him. Meanwhile, 
he is not, repeat not, to be disturbed.” 
He added, “And those are his orders.” 

“Very well, then,” snapped the 
deaconess. And to Qarisse Lane, 
“Come.” 

“It was a good try. Commodore,” 
said the girl, looking back wistfully 
at her unfinished drink, her still 
smouldering cigar. .“It was a good try 
— but it could have been a better 
one, as far as I’m concerned. Good 
night.” 

It was a good try, thought Grimes. 
Period. He had gone as far as he 
could go without undermining the 
master’s — the rector’s — authority 
too much. As for the girl — h^ 
heart fair bled for her. But he was 
sure that she would not, now, be 
maltreated, and it would do her no 
harm to revert to the abstemious rou- 
tine of this aptly named ship. 

“Good night,” he said. 

IV 

44TV I have a word with you, 

IVJLsir?” asked Smith when the 
two women were gone. 

“Surely. Stick around. Rector. This 
is Liberty Hall; you can spit on the 
mat and call the cat a bastard.”

Smith looked, but did acH voice, 
his disapproval of the figure or speech. 
He shut the door, snapped the lock 
on. Then, with a penknife taken from 
his pocket, he made a little adjust- 
ment to one of the securing screws 
of the mirror over the washbasin. 

“Bugged?” asked Grimes inter- 
estedly, 

“Of course — as is every compart- 
ment in the ship. But there are speak- 
ers and screens in only two cabins 
— my own and the presbyter’s. His 
reverence, I know, took sleeping pills 
before retiring — but he might 
awake.” 

“I suppose the ladies’ showers are 
bugged, too?” asked Grimes. 

A dull flush covered what little of 
the rector’s face that was not hid- 
den by his beard. He growled, ‘That, 
sir, is none of your business.” 

“And what, sir, is your business 
with me?” 

“I feel. Commodore Grimes, that 
you should know how important that 
unhappy woman is to the success of 
our mission. Then, perhaps, you will 
be less inclined, should the opportuni- 
ty present itself again, to pander to 
her whims.” Smith cleared his throat. 
He went on, “This business upsets 
me, sir. You will know, as you your- 
self were once a shipmaster, how un- 
pleasant it is to have to assert your 
authority.” 

“And talking,” said Grimes, who 
had his telepathic moments, “is thirs- 
ty work.” 

“If you would be so kind, sir,” 
said Smith, after a long moment of 
hesitation. “I believe that brandy has 
always been regarded as a medicine.” 

Grimes sighed and mixed fresh 



drinks. He motioned Smith to the 
single chair, sat down on the bunk. 
He thought of shocking the other 
man with one of the more obscene 
toasts, but merely said, “Down the 
hatch.” 

The rector said, “I needed that.” 
“Another, Rector Smith?” 

“No, thank you, sir.” 

You want me to twist your arm, 
you sanctimonious bastard, thought 
Grimes, but Vm not going to do it. 
He put the bottle of alcohol and the 
little cabinet of essences away. “And 
now,” he said, “about Miss Lane.” 
“Yes, Sister Lane. As she has told 
you, she was one of us. But she back- 
slid and consorted with the fornica- 
tors and wine-bibbers who call them- 
selves the Blossom People. But even 
this was in accordance with the Di- 
vine scheme of things. Whilst con- 
sorting with those . those pagans 
she became accustomed to the use 
and the abuse — but surely the use is 
also abuse! — of the psychedelic 
drugs. Already she possessed consider- 
able psychic powers — but those vile 
potions enhanced them. 

“You will realize, sir, that it 
would have been out of the question 
for any of our own Elect to imperil 
his immortal soul by tampering with 
powerful, unseen and unseeable 
forces, but — ” 

“But,” said Grimes, “Clarisse Lane 
has already demonstrated that she is 
damned, so you don’t mind using her 
as your catspaw.” 

“You put it very concinctly, sir,” 
agreed Smith. 

“I could say more, but I won’t I 
might lose my temper. Go on.” 
“Sister Lane is not entirely human.

She is descended from that Raul, a 
Stone Age savage from the remote 
past, who was brought to Earth from 
Kin^lving’s Planet. Many factors 
were involved in his appearance. It 
could be that the very fabric of the 
continuum is worn ttdn here on the 
Rim, and that lines of force, or fault 
lines, intersect at that world. It could 
be, as the Rhine Institute claimed at 
the time, that the loneliness and the 
fear of all the dwellers on the co- 
lonized Rim Worlds are somehow 
focused on Kinsolving. Be that as it 
may, it happened. And it happened 
too that, in the fullness of time, this 
Raul was accepted into the bosom of 
our church. 

“Raul, as you may know, was more 
than a mere telepath. Much more. He 
was a wizard, one of those who, in 
his own age, drew animals to the 
hunters’ spears by limning their like- 
nesses on rock.” 

Grimes interrupted. “Doesn’t the 
Bible say somewhere that thou shalt 
not suffer a witch to live?” 

44xres. It is so written. But we 
did not know of the full ex- 
tent of Raul’s talents when he was 
admitted into our fold. We did not 
know of them until after his death, 
when his papers came into our pos- 
session.” 

“But what are you playing at?” 
demanded Grimes. “Just what are 
you playing at in our back garden?” 
He had the bottle out again, and the 
little phial of cognac-flavored essence, 
and was mixing two more drinks. He 
held out one of them, the stronger, 
to Smith, who absentmindedly took 
it and raised it to his lips. 



The rector said, “Sir, I do not ap- 
prove of your choice of words. Life 
is not a game. Life, death and the 
hereafter are not a game. We are 
not playing. We are working. Is it 
not written, ‘Work, for the night is 
coming?’ And you, sir, and I, as space 
men, know that the night is coming 
— the inevitable heat death of the 
universe.” He gulped more of his 
drink. 

“You should visit Darsha some 
time,” said Grimes, “and their Tower 
of Darkness. You should see the huge 
clock that is the symbol of their 
God.” He added softly, “The clock 
is running down.” 

“Yes, the clock is running down, 
the sands of time are running out. 
And there is much to be done, so 
much to be done — ” 

“Such as?” 

‘To re-establish the eternal verities. 
To build a new Sinai, to see the com- 
mandments graven afresh on imper- 
ishable stone. And then, perhaps, the 
heathen, the idolaters will take heed 
and tremble. And then, surely, the 
rule of Jehovah will come again, be- 
fore the End.” 

Grimes said reasonably enough, 
“But you people believe in predestina- 
tion, don’t you? Either we’re damned 
or we aren’t. Nothing we do makes 
any difference.” 

‘T have learned by bitter experi- 
ence,” Smith told him, “that it is im- 
possible to argue with a heretic — 
especially one who is foredoomed to 
eternal damnation. But even you 
must see that if the commandments 
are given anew to Man then we, the 
elect, shall be elevated to our right- 
ful place in the universe.”

“Then God save us all,” said 
Grimes. 

Smith looked at him suspiciously, 
but went on. “It is perhaps necessary 
that there should be a sacrifice. If 
that be so, the Lord has already de- 
livered her into our hands. No, sir, 
do not look at me like that. We shall 
not kill her, neither by knife nor fire 
shall we slay her. But inevitably she 
will be the plaything of supernal 
powers when she, on the planet of 
her ancestral origin, her inherited 
talents intensified by drugs, calls to 
Jehovah, the true God, the God of the 
Old Testament, to make himself 
known again to sinful men.” 

There were flecks of white froth 
on Smith’s beard around his lips, a 
dribble of saliva down the hair on his 
chin. His eyes were glaring and blood- 
shot. Grimes thought. In vino veritas. 
He said, with a gentleness he did 
not feel, activated only by self-inter- 
est, “Don’t you think that you’ve had 
enough, Rector? Isn’t it time that we 
both turned in?” 

“Eh, what? When’m ready. But you 
understand now that you must not 
interfere. You must not interfere,'^’ 

“I understand,” said Grimes, 
thinking, Too much and not enough. 
He found a tube of tablets in his suit- 
case, shook one into the palm of his 
hand. “Here,” he said, offering it. 
“You’d better take this.” 

“Wha’s it for?” 

“It’ll sweeten the breath and sober 
you up. It’ll be too bad for you if 
the presbyter sees the state you’re in.” 
And too bad for me, he thought. 

“ ‘M not drunk.” 

“Of course not. Just a little . 
unsteady.” 



“Don’ really need .... But jus’ 
to oblige, /understan’.” 

Smith swallowed the tablet, his 
Adam’s apple working convulsively. 
Grimes handed him a glass of cold 
water to wash it down. It acted al- 
most immediately. The bearded man 
shuddered, then got steadily to his 
feet. He glared at Grimes — but it 
was no longer a fanatical glare. “Good 
night, sir,” he snapped. 

“Good night. Rector,” Grimes re- 
plied. 

When he was alone he thought of 
playing back the record of the eve- 
ning’s conversations, but thought bet- 
ter of it. For all he knew. Smith 
might be able to switch the hidden 
microphone and scanner back on 
from his own quarters — and the 
less he knew of the tiny device hid- 
den in the starboard epaulette of his 
white mess jacket, the better. 

He got out of his clothes and into 
his bunk, switched off the light — 
but, unusually for him, his sleep 
was uneasy and nightmare ridden. He 
supposed that it was Clarisse Lane’s 
fault that she played a leading part 
in most of the dreams. 

V 

T he voyage wore on, and on, and 
even as the ever-precessing 
gyroscopes of the Mannschenn 
Drive tumbled and receded down the 
dark infinities, so did the good ship 
Piety fall through the twisted con- 
tinuum. On one hand was the warped, 
convoluted galactic lens and ahead, a 
pulsating spiral of iridescent Hgfht 
against the ultimate darkness, was the 
Kinsolving sun.

And this ship» unlike other ships 
of Grimes’s wide experience, was no 
little man-made oasis of light and 
warmth in the vast, empty desert of 
the night. She was cold, cold, and 
her atmosphere carried always the 
faint acridity of disinfectant, and men 
and women talked in grave, low 
voices and did not mingle, and never 
was there the merest hint gf laughter. 

Clarisse Lane was not being mal- 
treated — Grimes made sure of 
that. She was even allowed to meet 
the commodore for a daily conver- 
sation, but always heavily chaperon- 
ed. She was the only telepath in the 
ship which, while the interstellar 
drive was in operation, depended en- 
tirely upon the Carlotti equipment for 
deep space communication. But the 
rector and the presbyter did not doubt 
that she was in constant touch with 
Mayhew back at Port Forlorn — and 
Grimes did not doubt it either. She 
told him so much during their meet- 
ings — things about which she could 
not possibly have known if there had 
not been a continual interchange of 
signals. Some of this* intelligence was 
confirmed by messages addressed to 
Grimes and received, in the normal 
way, by the ship’s electronic radio of- 
ficer. 

So they were obliged to be careful, 
these Neo Calvinists. The chosen in- 
strument for their experiment in 
practical theology was now also an 
agent for the Rim Worlds Confeder- 
acy. “But what does it matter?” Smith 
said to Grimes on one of the rare 
occasions that he spoke at length to 
him. “What does it matter? Perhaps 
it was ordained this way. Your friend 
Mayhew will be the witness to the 



truth, a witness who is not one of 
us. He will see through her eyes, 
hear with her ears, feel with every 
fiber of her being. The Word propa- 
gated by ourselves alone would be 
scoffed at. But there will be credence 
given it when it is propagated by an 
unbeliever.” 

“If anything happens,” said 
Grimes. 

But he couldn’t argue with these 
people, and they couldn’t argue with 
him. There was just no meeting of 
minds. He remembered a theory that 
he had once heard advanced by a 
ship’s doctor. “Long ago,” the man 
had said, “very long ago, there was 
a mutation. It wasn’t a physically ob- 
vious one — but, as a result of it. 
Homo Sapiens was divided into two 
separate species. Homo credulens — 
those capable of blind faith in the im- 
provable — and homo incredulens — 
those who aren’t. The vast majority 
of people are, of course, hybrids.” 

Grimes had said, “And I suppose 
that aU the pure homo incredulens 
stock is either atheist or agnostic.” 

“Not so,” the doctor had laughed. 
“Not so. Agnostic — yes. But don’t 
forget that the atheist, like the theist, 
makes a definite statement for which 
he can produce no proof whatsoever.” 

An atheist would have been far 
less unhappy aboard this ship than a 
tolerant agnistic like Grimes. 

But even the longest, unhappiest 
voyage comes to an end. A good 
planetfall was made — whatever they 
believed. Piety's people were excellent 
navigators — and, the Mannschenn 
Drive switched off, the inertial drive 
ticking over just enough to produce 
minimal gravitational field, the ship

was falling in orbit about the lonely 
world, the blue and green mottled 
sphere hanging there against the 
blackness. 

T he old charts — or copies of 
them — were out, and Grimes 
was called up to the control room. 
“Yes,” he told Smith, stabbing a 
finger down on to the paper, “that’s 
where the spaceport was. ftobably 
even now the apron’s not too over- 
grown for a safe landing. Captain 
Spence, when he came down in 
Epsilon Eridani, reported creepers 
over everything, but nothing heavy.” 
“It is a hundred and fifty stand^d 
years since he was here,” said Smith. 
“At least I would suggest one of the 
beaches.” 

“Risky,” Grimes told him. “They 
shelve very steeply and, according to 
our record violent storms are more 
frequent than otherwise.” He turned 
to the big screen upon which a mag- 
nification of the planet was appearing. 
“There, just to the east of the sun- 
rise terminator. That’s the major 
continent — Farland, it was called — 
where the capital city and the space- 
port were situated. You see that river, 
with the S bend? Step up the magnifi- 
cation, somebody.” 

Now there was only the glowing 
picture of the island continent, filling 
all the screen, and that expanded, so 
that there was only the sprawling, 
silvery S. Toward the middle of it, on 
either bank, a straggle of buildings 
was visible. 

“The spaceport should be about 10 
miles to the west,” said Grimes. 

“Yes,” agreed Smith, taking a long 
pointer. “I think that’s it.” 



“Then make it landing stations, 
Rector,” ordered Presbjrter Cannan. 

“Sir,” demurred Smith, “you can- 
not put a big ship down as though 
she were a dinghy.” 

“Lord, oh Lord,” almost prayed 
the presbyter. “To have come so far, 
and then to be plagued by the dilatori- 
ness of spacemen!” 

I wish that this were my control 
room, thought Grimes. 

But Piety* s crew worked well and 
efficiently, and in a very short space 
of time the intercom speakings were 
blatting strings of orders — “Secure 
all for landing stations!” “All idlers 
to their quarters!” and the like. 
Gyroscopes hummed and whined and 
the ship tilted relative to the planet 
until its surface was directly beneath 
her, and the first of the sounding 
rockets, standard equipment for a sur- 
vey expedition but not for landing on 
a world with spaceport control func- 
tioning, were fired. 

Parachutes blossomed in the upper 
atmosphere, and the flares, each 
emitting a great streamer of smoke, 
ignited. Somebody was singing. It 
was the presbyter. 

Let the fiery, cloudy pillar 
Guide me all my journey 
through .... 

Even Grimes was touched by the 
spirit of the occasion. What if this 
crazy, this impious (for so he was 
beginning to think of it) experiment 
did work? What would happen? What 
would be unleashed upon the worlds 
of men? Who was it — the Gnostics? 
— who had said that the God of 
the Old Testament was the Devil of 
the New? He shivered as he sat in 
his acceleration chair.

She was dropping steadily, was 
Piety, following the first of her 
flares. But there was drift down there 
— a gale, perhaps, in the upper at- 
mosphere, or a jet stream. The iner- 
tial drive generators grumbled sud- 
denly as Smith applied lateral thrust. 
Down she dropped, and down, al- 
most falling free, but under the full 
control of her captain. On the target 
screen, right in the center, highly 
magnified, the cluster of ruins that 
had been a spaceport was clearly visi- 
ble, tilting like tombstones in a de- 
serted graveyard, ghastly in the blue 
light of the rising sun. 

Down she dropped, plunging 
through the wisps of cirrus, and there 
was a slight but appreciable rise of 
temperature as skin friction heated 
the metal of her hull. Smith slowed 
the rate of descent. The presbyter 
started muttering irritably to himself. 

There was no longer need for 
magnification on the screen. The 
great rectangle of the landing field 
was clearly visible, the vegetation 
that covert it lighter in color — 
eau de Nile against the surrounding 
indigo — than the brush outside the 
area. The last of the flares to have 
been fired was still burning there, its 
column of smoke rising almost ver- 
tically. The growth among which it 
had fallen was slowly smouldering. 

Grimes looked at Smith. The man 
was concentrating, hard. Beads of 
perspiration were forming on his up- 
per cheeks, running down into his 
beard. But this was more important 
than an ordinary landing. So much 
hinged upon it. And perhaps malign 
(or benign) forces might be gathering 
their strength to overset the ship be- 



fore her massive tripedal landing gear 
reached the safety of the planetary 
surface. 

But she was down. 

There was the gentlest of shocks, 
the faintest of creakings, the softest 
sighing of shock-absorbers. She was 
down, and the inertial drive genera- 
tors muttered to themselves and then 
were quiet She was down, and the 
soughing of the fans seemed to make 
the silence all the more silent 
Presbyter Cannan broke it He 
turned in his chair to address Grimes. 
“Commodore,” he asked as he point- 
ed towards a distant peak, a black, 
truncated cone against the blue sky, 
“Commodore Grimes, what is the 
name of that mountain?” 

“I . don’t know, sir.” 

‘7 know.” The old man’s voice 
was triumphant. “It is SinaL” 

VI 

H ad this been any other ship there 
would have been a period of re- 
laxation. There were wild pigs and 
rabbits to hunt, descendants of the 
livestock abandoned by the original 
colonists. There were the famous 
caves, with their rock paintings, to 
visit. But the animals, their fear of 
Man long forgotten, came out of 
the undergrowth to stare curiously 
at the vessel and at the humans who 
busied themselves around her, open- 
ing side ports to allow the egress 
of the three pinnaces, already stock- 
ed with what would be required for 
the final stages of the expedition. And 
nobody was remotely interested in 
the caves. 

Grimes managed to see Qarisse

Lane. The ship was almost deserted 
now, so he was able to make his way 
down into the women’s quarters 
without being challenged and stopped. 
He found her little cabin, hardly 
more than a cell. She was not locked 
in, not restrained in any way. She 
was sitting in her chair, a somber 
figure in her black dress, staring into 
nothingness. Her full lips moved al- 
most imperceptibly as she vocalized 
her thoughts. 

With a sudden start she realized 
that Grimes was standing before her. 
She whispered, “I ... I was talking 
to Ken.” 

‘To Mayhew?” 

“Yes.” 

Saying good-by, he thought. He 
said, “Clarisse, you don’t have to go 
through with this.” 

“I am going through with it, Com- 
modore.” 

“You don’t have to,” he insisted. 
“You’re in touch with Mayhew. And 
he’ll be in touch with Rim Sword. 
The admiral told me that she’d be 
standing by in this sector of space. 
She’s proabbly on her way here now. 
We can stall off these fanatics until 
she comes in.” 

She said, ‘Tm going through with 
it.” 

“But why? Why?” 

‘‘Because I want to.” 

“But you’re not really one of 
them.” 

“I’m not.” 

“Sister Lane!” It was the deacon- 
ess. “You asked for a few moments 
of privacy — and now I find you 
with this . this lecher! But come. 
The boat is waiting.” 

“I’ll come with you,” said Grimes. 



“You will not,” snapped the 
woman. “A place has been reserved 
for you in the pinnace carrying the 
presbyter and the rectcw. They have 
decided that it is meet that an in- 
fidel shall witness the handing down 
of the Law.” 

Clarisse Lane followed the deacon- 
ess from the cabin. Grimes trailed 
along behind them. They went down 
to the main airlock, down the ramp 
to the overgrown apron, stumbling 
over the tough, straggling vines on 
their way to the boats. The sun was 
dropping fast to the western horizon. 
There was a hint of chill, a smell of 
dusk in the still air. There was the 
scent of growing things, and a faint 
hint of corruption. 

Smith beckoned to Grimes from 
the open door of the leading pinnace. 
He made his way slowly towards it, 
walking carefully. He clambered up 
the retractable steps into the crowded 
cabin that stank of perspiration and 
damp, heavy clothing. He found a 
seat, wedged between two junior of- 
ficers. 

The door hissed shut. The inertial 
drive generator throbbed and snarled. 
Grimes could not see out of the ports, 
but he knew that the boat was air- 
borne, was moving. There was no 
conversation in the cabin, but a 
metallic male voice reported from 
the speaker on the pilot’s console, 
“Number Two following.” After a 
pause a harsh female voice said, 
“Number Three following.” 

How long the flight lasted Grimes 
did not know; he was unable to 
raise his arm to look at his watch. 
But it seemed a long time, and it 
seemed a long time that they sat 

IF

there, after they had landed, waiting 
for the other boats to come down. 
But at last the door opened and a 
thin, icy wind whined through the 
aperture. The presbyter was out first, 
then Smith, and eventually Grimes, in 
the middle of a huddle of officers 
and civilians. 

The plateau was smooth, wind- 
swept, an expanse of bare rock. To 
one side of it were the three pinnaces, 
and in front of them the men were 
drawn up in orderly ranks, with only 
the Presbyter standing apart. In the 
middle of the circular area were the 
women, a ragged huddle of somber 
black. 

Grimes’s attention was caught by a 
blue spark far below, not far from 
the still gleaming, serpentine river. 
Had Rim Sword landed? No. It was 
only the control room windows of 
Piety reflecting the last rays of the 
setting sun. 

There was a subdued murmuring 
as the women walked to stand to one 
side of the men. No, not all the 
women. Two remained in the center 
of the plateau. One was the deacon- 
ess, tall and forbidding. The other 
was Clarisse Lane. They had stripped 
her. She was wearing only a kilt 
cut roughly from the hide of some 
animal, clothing like that which had 
been worn by her ancestresses on this 
very planet. She was shivering and 
hugging her full breasts to try to 
keep out the cold. 

Stark, incongruous, an easel stood 
there, supporting a framed square of 
black canvas, and there was a battery- 
powered floodlight to illuminate it. 
At its foot were pots of pigment and 
brushes. Raul, the forefather of this 



girl, had called animals with his 
paintings. What would she call? 
What could she call? 

“Drink!” said the deaconess, her 
voice loud and clear over the thin 
whine of the bitter wind. “Drink!” 
She was holding out a glass of some- 
thing. Clarisse took it, drained it. 

S uddenly the sun was gone, and 
there was only the glare of the 
floodlight. Overhead was the almost 
empty black sky, and low to the 
east was an arc of misty lumine- 
scence that was the slowly rising 
galactic lens. The wind seemed to 
be coming straight from inter-galac- 
tic space. 

The deaconess stalked over the 
rocky surface to take her stand be- 
side the presbyter, leaving the girl 
alone. Hesitantly Clarisse stooped to 
the pots and brushes, selected one 
of the latter, dipped it into paint, 
straightened, stood before the easel. 
She stiffened into immobility, seemed 
to be waiting for something. 

They were singing, then — the 
black-clad men and women drawn 
up in their stiff ranks before the 
pinnaces. They were singing — Cwn 
Rhonda it was, and even Grimes, 
who had always loved that old Welsh 
hymn tune, found it hard to refrain 
from joining in. They were singing 
— the rumbling basses, the baritones, 
the high tenors and the shrill sopran- 
os. 

Guide mey oh thou great Jehovah 
Pilgrim through this barren land! 
I am weak, but thou art mighty. 
Hold me with thy powerful hand! 
They were singing, and the girl was 
painting. With deft, sure strokes she 



THE RIM GODS 



85 





was depicting on the black canvas 
the figure of a god, white-bearded, 
white-robed, wrathful. She was paint- 
ing, and the men and women were 
singing, and the air was full of un- 
bearable tension and the wind now 
was howling, tugging at their clothing, 
buffeting them — but the easel in 
its circle of harsh light stood steady 
and the girl worked on ... 

There was the dreadful crack of 
lightning close at hand, too close at 
hand, the crack and the dazzle, and 
the pungency of ozone, and the long, 
long streamer of blue fire licking out 
from above their heads and culminat- 
ing on the plain far below, at the 
spaceport. 

There was the burgeoning fireball 
where the ship had been. 

There was the dreadful laughter. 



booming above the frenzy of the 
wind, and the metallic crash and clat- 
ter as the pinnaces, lifted and roiled 
over the rim of the plateau, plunged 
to destruction down the steep, rocky 
mountain slope. 

And They were there — the ro- 
bust, white-bearded deity, a lightning 
bolt clutched and ready in his right 
hand, and the naked, seductively 
smiling goddess, and the other naked 
one with her bow and her leashed 
hounds, and she in the white robes, 
carrying a book, with the owl perched 
on her shoulder. The lame smith was 
there, with his hammer, and the sea- 
god, with his trident, and he with 
the red beard and the helmet and the 
body armor and the sword. 

Somebody screamed, and at least 
a score of the men and women had

fallen to their knees. But the presby- 
ter stood his ground. 

“Who are you?” he shouted. “Who 
are you?” 

“little man,” the great voice re- 
plied, “we were, we are and we al- 
ways shall be.” 

Grirnes realized that fie was laugh- 
ing uncontrollably and saying, over 
and over to himself, “Not Sinai, but 
Olympus! Not Sinai, but OlympusI” 

There was another supernal clap 
of thunder and the dark came sweep- 
ing back. 

T hey sat around in miserable little 
groups on the bare mountain 
top. 

The presbyter was gone, nobody 
knew where or how, and the deacon- 
ess, and Smith, and perhaps a dozen 
of the others. It had been a long 
night, and a cold one, but the sun 
had risen at last, bringing some 
warmth with it. 

Grimes, in shirt and trousers, stood 
with Clarisse Lane, who was 
wrapped in his jacket. 

“But what happened?” he was 
asking. “What happened? What did 
you do?” 



She said, “I ... I don’t know. I 
suppose that I do have some sort of 
power. And I suppose that I am, at 
heart, one of the Blossom People. 
Our religious beliefs are a sort of 
vague pantheism .... And, after 
all, the Father of the Gods is very 
similar in his attributes to the patri- 
archal gods of later religious.” She 
looked at the sky. “It’s lucky that 
Fm a telepath as well as being . 
whatever it is that I am. Rim Sword 
will be here very shortly. I hope it’s 
soon. I have a feeling that when some 
of our fanatical friends recover 
they’ll be blaming me for everything.” 
*When they recover,” said Grimes. 
“It will take me a long time.” He 
added, “But I don’t think you’d bet- 
ter return to Francisco with them.” 
“Ken,” she told him, “has already 
got the formalities under way that will 
make me a Rim Worlds citizen.” 
“The obvious ones?” 

“Yes.” 

“And are you going to get mar- 
ried in church?” he asked. “It should 
be interesting.” 

“Not if I can help it,” she told 
him.

MEANWHILE, 
BACK AT THE 
WORLDCON . 

by LIN CARTER 



Our Man in Fandom gives us 
another look at SFs biggest 
convention — until next year! 



W e were talking about Nycon 3> 
the 25th World Science Fic- 
tion Convention held over the Labor 
Day weekend at the Statler-Hilton 
in New York City. It was the biggest 
convention in science-fiction history, 
with a good 1500 fans and pros on 
the scene^ including Your Man in 
Fandom. 

Sunday morning September 3rd, I 
got to the hotel ready for the third 
day of the convention and ran into 
Samuel R. Delany (“Chip” to his 
friends). I learned that the Edgar 
Rice Burroughs fans were having a 
meeting in a restaurant near the ho- 
tel. Frank Frazetta came to this 
“Burroughs breakfast,” bringing with 
him as a surprise guest the great com- 
ics artist Hal Foster, who used to 



draw the Tarzan Sunday panels and 
who is best known to the rest of us 
as the creator of Prince Valiant. 

Frazetta and Hal Foster, inciden- 
tally, were not the only artists in 
town for the Woridcon weekend. I 
also spoke to Roy Krenkel and Jack 
Gaughan and Gray Morrow. Ed 
Emsh was at the Nycon too, although 
I didn’t happen to run into him , and 
so was Ballantine’s famous cover art- 
ist Richard Powers; I know, because 
I bought one of his paintings. And 
my wife Noel, a great Sax Rohmer 
fan, purchased an oil portrait of Fu 
Manchu which had appeared on a 
back cover of Castle of Franken- 
stein from the painter Russ Jones . 
so the art world was well represented 
at the Woridcon.

The Great Costume Ball 

That night the huge costume ball 
was held. My wife and I love any ex- 
cuse to dress up for a masquerade, 
so she came in glittering plumes, be- 
jeweled as the Queen of Night from 
Mozart’s The Magic Flute, while I 
donned black velvet robes and spar- 
kling homed mitre as the Royal 
Necromancer of Aquilonia. I discov- 
ered later that in all, some 98 people 
attended in costume. Among them I 
noticed such famous celebrities as 
Retief and King Kull and Gully 
Foyle. Sauron and Fu Manchu and 
Dian the Beautiful were there as welh 
And Robert Graves’s White God- 
dess and the Phantom of the Opera, 
and even the Wizard of Lemuria (I). 

Some of the costumes were comi- 
cal and ingenious; others were elab- 
orate and glamorous, like the glitter- 
ing tights and headdresses worn by 
Olga Ley and daughter Sandra, who 
came as their impression of Brad- 
bury’s “Golden Apples of the Sun 
and Silver Apples of the Moon.” 

Oh, and Mr. Spock from Star 
Trek. Or, rather, the Mr. Spocks. 
For I saw no less than seven of the 
point-eared people. One of them, un- 
less my eyes were deceiving me, was 
Forrest J Ackerman of Famous 
Monsters of Filmland. The commit- 
tee judging the costumes really had 
“Spocks” before their eyes! (Sorry 
’bout that: every time I mention or 
think of Ackerman, my mind starts 
coming up with puns . .) 

Parties and Things 

You’ll find you have the most fun 



at conventions during the evenings 
after the formal program is over and 
people go room-hopping from party 
to party. After the ball, my wife and 
I packed away the costumes, cleaned 
off the makeup and had some people 
in for drinks. L. Sprague and Cath- 
erine de Camp sat talking to a circle 
of fans about Atlantis and Stone- 
henge and that sort of thing, while 
off in one comer, Roy Krenkel was 
drawing a sketch for me; I got the 
chance to meet some interesting peo- 
ple and to talk with them. One young 
man from New Orleans, knowing me 
to be a Prince Valiant fan, told me 
that this year’s Mardi Gras in Feb- 
ruary had been built around the 
theme of Hal Foster’s great comic 
feature, with costumes and floats and 
pageants and tableaus. The idea was 
to celebrate his 30th anniversary of 
Prince Valiant-ing. 

Frankly, I’d never known that New 
Orleans’ famous Mardi Gras did 
things like that, and 1 was fascinated 
to learn this was not the first time 
Prince Valiant had served as theme 
and that the Oz books have also been 
similarly honored in the Mardi Gras. 
I’d certainly like to be there next 
time. 

Then I got to talking with Fred D. 
Brammer of McLean, Virginia, a big 
fan of Star Trek. He informed me 
that Richard K. Preston, executive of- 
ficer of the National Air and Space 
Museum Archives of the Smithsoni- 
an Institution had recently asked 
Gene Roddenberry, the producer of 
the show, for a copy of Ae first Star 
Trek program for permanent inclu- 
sion in the Smithsonian’s archives. 
This is the first time any science-fic- 



BACK AT WORLDCON 



19 




tion tv show or movie has been so 
honored, I believe. 

Mr. Roddenberry, by the way, was 
at the Worldcon and showed a seg- 
ment of Star Trek called “Amok 
Time” scripted by Theodore Stur- 
geon. He also screened a film of 
Star Trek bloopers which was rather 
mad. 

The Banquet and the Hugoes 

Every year at the Worldcon, a 
huge banquet is held at which the 
Guest of Honor delivers his speech 
and the Hugo Awards are given out. 
The banquet at Nycon 3 has a rec- 
ord attendance of 583. The toastmas- 
ter was Harlan Ellison, whose anec- 
dotal speech was followed by Bob 
Tucker’s even more anecdatol speech. 
Then the Hall of Fame Award (given 
annually by First Fandom, a group of 
fans who have been active in science 
fiction from the very beginnings of 
fandom) was given to one of the 
grand old men of sf, Edmond Ham- 
ilton. 

Sam Moskowitz presented the 
award, and Moskowitz’s speech, 
which had earlier been timed to five 
minutes, ran on and on as if Mosko- 
witz just wouldn’t stop talking. It fin- 
ally consumed a solid twenty minutes 
of tigjitiy scheduled program time. 
Despite efforts to stop him, he even 
insisted on reading the lengthy in- 
scription on the Hall of Fame trophy. 
As a result, Lester del Rey — the 
Guest of Honor! had to cut his own 
speech down very short. I understand 
the convention committee is hopping 
mad about this, and it does seem 
highly inconsiderate of Moskowitz. 



Mr. del Rey’s speech was short, 
terse and intense. He held his audi- 
ence right in the pahn of his hand 
and made a powerful argument for 
old-fashioned story-telling in science 
fiction as against the so-called “New 
Wave” writers (or “the New Ripple,” 
as Lester called the movement, which 
has centered around the British mag- 
azine New Worlds and such writers 
as Michael Moorcock, Brian Aldiss 
and J. G. Ballard, among others). 

After the banquet, I had a chance 
to speak to Lester and congratulate 
him on his Guest-of-Honorship, re- 
marking that it was about time! Les- 
ter called to my attention the fact 
that Catherine Kuttner — Henry 
Kuttner’s widow, a fine writer in her 
own right under the name of C. L. 
Moore — has also missed out and 
well deserves being chosen Guest of 
Honor at some future convention. 
Recalling her splendid stories, like 
the short yam Vintage Season and 
the famous novel Judgment Night, I 
fully agreed with him. 

Several other awards of various 
kinds were given out. Forrest J 
Ackerman gave the Big Heart Award 
to Janie Lamb of the National Fan- 
tasy Fan Federation. Ted White got 
a golden ping-pong paddle for “for 
keeping fans interested,” and the 
Worldcon presented a special plaque 
to CBS Television for their 21st Cen- 
tury show, for “bringing the future 
into the present.” 

Then came the Hugoes. To be 
brief, the Hugoes went to: 

Best Short Story: Neutron Star, by 
Larry Niven, from If. 

Best Novelette: The Last Castle, by 
Jack Vance, from Galaxy.

IP 




Best.Novel: The Moon is a Harsh 
Mistress, by Robert Heinlein, from 

If. 

Best Prozine: Worlds of If, 

Best Dramatic Presentation: The 
Menagerie, from Star Trek, 

Best Pro Artist: Jack Gaughan. 

Best Fan Artist: Jack Gaughan. 

Best Fanzine: Niekas, 

Best Fan Writer: Alexei Panshin. 

This is the FOURTH Hugo that 
Heinlein has won, and that’s more 
Hugoes than any other writer in sci- 
ence-fiction history has accumulated. 
His first Hugo came for Double Star 
at the 1956 convention in New York. 
He won his second for Starship 
Troopers at Pittsburgh in 1960. His 
third Hugo was presented to him at 
Chicago in 1962, for Stranger in a 
Strange Land, 

As for Jack Vance, this was his 
second Hugo. He received his first 
for The Dragon Masters at Wash- 
ington D. C. in 1963. 

This was the second year in a row 
that the Hugo for best professional 
science-fiction magazine of the year 
went to this magazine. 

And this is the first time in fan- 
nish history that the same guy won 
the awards for Best Pro and Best 
Fan ArtistI (Come to think of it, 
this was also the first time anyone 
gave out a Hugo for Best Fan Art- 
ist.) 



Next Year's Worldcon 

One of the most important things 
that happens at each of these annual 
world science fiction conventions is 
bidding for and voting on the site 
of next year’s convention. If you 
couldn’t make this year’s Nycon 3, 
maybe we’ll see you next Labor Day 
weekend, when the 26th World Sci- 
ence Fiction Convention convenes at 
the Hotel Claremont in Oakland/ 
Berkeley, California. The 26th World- 
con will be called “The Baycon.” 

I can’t tell you very much about 
it this early — the Guest of Honor 
will be Philip Jos6 Farmer — but a 
first sketch of Baycon’s program has 
been tentatively announced, and on 
the program are Anthony Boucher, 
Robert Heinlein, Keith Laumer, Ray 
Bradbury, Robert Bloch, Avram Da- 
vidson, Joan Baez (?I?) and Damon 
Knight, not to mention a special 
two-hour segment on Monster Fan- 
dom, whose redoubtable host will be 
genial Forrest J Ackerman. 

Fans who want to attend the 1968 
Baycon can write to Baycon, P.O. 
Box 261, Fairmont Station, El Cer- 
rito, California 94530. 

Science-fiction conventions have 
one thing in common with a bus — if 
you miss one, there’s another coming 
along in a while. So if you couldn’t 
make it to New York this year, try to 
plan for the Baycon next September. 

See you there in 1968 — for the 
time of your life! END

In addition* its hide hung on it 
like an ill-fitting flour sack* patched 
with flakes the color of mildew* gan- 
grene and rust. That was what was 
riveting Jeffs attention: the half- 
formed question of how something 
so deformed and leprous could live. 

He tore his eyes away and fixed 
them instead on what ought to have 
been* but for some unaccountable 
reason was not, a far more inviting 
prospect — the xenobiologist at his 
side. 

“I was just impressing the details 
on my memory,” he lied, then added 
because he was unsure how well 
he had concealed his reaction, “Ifs 
not a very prepossessing beast, is it?” 

“On the contrary,” Dr. Kunje said. 
“It — or to be more exact, she is an 
exceptionally well endowed speci- 
men.” 

“She?” 

“We decided on a female because 
they are somewhat larger than the 
males, which gives us additional space 
inside the carcass, naturally. And also 
because of the relative territorial hab- 
its ot the two sexes. The females tend 
to stay in any given area for a fairly 
long time. The males roam from place 
to place. At the stage our survey has 
now reached we are adequately sup- 
plied with the kind of superficial data 
that can be gathered from a hasty 
once-over. What we need is the fine 
detail to complete the picture. Do you 
follow me?” Dr. Kunje spoke with 
the politely patronizing tone of the 
exp^ forced to enlist the aid of a 
handyman for a relatively insignifi- 
cant task. 

Jeff gave her the same kind of 
thou^tful examination he had given 



the creature in the bubble and noted 
a remarkable parallel between her and 
it. She was — if he wasn’t mistaken 
— potentially a rather beautiful wom- 
an: tall, with dark hair and large 
bright eyes, and a tawny-gold com- 
plexion. But, as though to deny any 
continuity between the part of her 
that was exposed and the part that 
was covered, she chose to wear the 
loosest and baggiest set of all-purpose 
coveralls he had ever seen and fur- 
thermore to string them about and 
stuff their pockets with whatever 
could be called on to provide lumps 
and bulges in the wrong places. 

H e felt a vague stir of disappoint- 
ment. The universe was awfully 
big, and the tiny enclaves of human 
awareness which were the starships, 
darting from system to system were 
oppressively small. They far too easi- 
ly became boring. Though he had an 
excellent and reliable crew , working 
under him he could tell that he was 
near his own personal limit of en- 
durance and might soon start to snap 
at those he was really most fond of. 
He had looked forward to this unex- 
pected assignment, calling at the 
Chryseis research station and helping 
out with a key project, mainly as a 
chance to renew his sense of . • • 
what would you call it? Solidarity? 
That feeling of companionship* at 
any rate, which alone sustained wan- 
dering humanity among these harsh 
stars and bleak, uninhabitable planets. 

Granted, research scientists were 
of a different temperament from 
people who went into the Advanced 
Guard. Nonetheless, they also being 
human —

“You do an awful lot of staring. 
Commander Hook!” Dr. Kunje said 
sharply. 

“I find you much more enjoyable 
to look at than the creature in there,” 
Jeff said, with a jerk of his thumb 
toward the bubble. It was a compli- 
ment honestly enough meant, but the 
response it provoked was to freeze 
her dark eyes into chips of black 
Plutonian ice. 

“You are not here to enjoy any- 
thing, Commander!” the xenobiolo- 
gist said. “You are here to perform 
a service for us. Can it be done?” 

“I guess so,” Jeff sighed, and turn- 
ed to go. When he was twenty paces 
distant along the tunnel which linked 
the bubble with the main section of 
the orbital research station, she called 
after him. 

“By the way. Commander!” 

“Yes?” 

“Your — shall we say, politely, 
‘uncalled-fori? — remark just now re- 
minded me of a point I had been in- 
tending to bring to your attention. I 
know that the members of the Guard 
lead a somewhat irregular life during 
their long periods on patrol, but that 
is somewhat excusable in view of the 
shortage of genuinely demanding 
tasks they are called on to fulfill. I 
should just like to make it plain that 
here we do have such tasks — any 
number of them. And I have no in- 
tention of permitting the looseness of 
your customary behavior to contam- 
inate my staff.” 

Jeff, struggling through the haze 
of verbiage, gave a blank headshake. 

“I’m telling you. Commander,” 
Dr. Kunje said in an impatient tone, 
“to keep fraternization to a minimum 



during your stay. Do you under- 
stand? Or must I draw you physio- 
logical diagrams?” 

n 

W hen he re-entered the lock of 
his own ship, Jeff found two 
of the research station staff already 
present, talking with his senior lieu- 
tenants: a large, stout, motherly, fair- 
haired woman of early mid^e age 
whom he identified from the records 
he had studied on the way here as 
Dr. Ingrid Swann, and a younger man, 
very lean and nervous but affable in 
manner whom he recognized as Dr. 
Matthew Couperin. 

Lieutenant Sandy Baravitch was 
talking as he came in — she had 
probably been doing most of the talk- 
ing, as usual — but she broke off in 
mid-sentence and blew him a kiss of 
welcome. 

“How did you get on with the 
dragon?” she exclaimed. 

Beside her. Lieutenant Tom Che- 
liki winced and glanced at the stran- 
gers, his protuberant eyes very bright 
in his dark face, but the stout wom- 
an gave a wry chuckle. 

“Please don’t judge all of us by Dr. 
Kunje!” she said. “It simply wouldn’t 
be fair.” 

“That’s good,” Jeff sighed and 
slumped into a vacant chair around 
the projector table on which the sci- 
entists were displaying the data ap- 
parently balanced on treetops in a 
Chryseian jungle, and he brightened 
at the sight of them. 

“One for you?” Sandy suggested, 
and suited the action to the word by 
going to the refreshment dispenser.

‘IVe just been sternly warned 
against tto sort of behavior,” Jeff 
said, ‘‘No fraternizing, to quote the 
exact phrase,*’ 

“You must be joking!” Tom said. 
“This is our first outship contact in 
over four months, and for those poor 
so-and-sos it’s the first in — how 
long did you say. Matt?” 

Dr. Couperin stared briefly at the 
ceiling. “Ah. , , . Eight months, four 
days and sixteen minutes, to the mo- 
ment your commander stepped 
through our lock.” 

Having lowered the level in his 
glass by a conservative fifty per cent, 
Jeff set it down along with the others, 
on the crown of a remarkable Earth- 
like tree. “I get the impression that 
Dr. Kunje likes it that way. What’s 
wrong? Has she been crossed in love, 
or something?” 

“Don’t be unkind to her,” Ingrid 
Swann said. “She’s an absolutely 
first-class biologist, and it’s something 
of an honor for us to be working un- 
der her.” 

“What she needs is someone to 
get to work on her,” Couperin said 
barely audibly and then flushed 
bright red as he turned to Sandy. 
“I’m sorry, that was crude! It just 
slipped out.” 

But Sandy was grinning so broad- 
ly that the freckles on her cheeks 
had almost disappeared into a suc- 
cession of dimples. She reached over 
and patted Couperin’s hand under- 
standingly. 

“That’s okay! So long as somebody 
retains a sense of humor here I guess 
we can bear to stick around long 
enough to do the job your boss wants 
from us. Jeff, did you get all the de- 



tails or do you want us to run 
through them again.” 

“To be frank, I cut my interview 
with Dr. Kunje short,” Jeff admitted. 
“Let’s take it again from the top. 
There was one question in particular 
I didn’t get around to asking, and I 
should have done so. I gather that 
Chryseis is pretty well a terra-type 
world, correct?” 

Ingrid nodded. 

“In other words, it has CHON-type 
biology — carbon-hydrogen-oxygen- 
nitrogen — fairly standard gravity, 
regular proportions of land to ocean, 
same general temperature and so 
forth. Well, in the past century or so 
we must have run across fifty or sixty 
worlds of this type. What’s so special 
about Chryseis that it’s attracted a 
research team like yours and that it 
rates a priority adequate to haul an 
Advance Guard boat off its routine 
patrol and enlist our help? 

C ouperin leaned forward so that he 
appeared to be resting his el- 
bows on the treetops within the pro- 
jector table. “My best guess is a sense 
of racial guilt,” he said. 

“What?” 

“Let’s look at it this way. What 
were the largest animals ever to exist 
on Earth?” 

Jeff hesitated. “Why. Well, 
some species of dinosaur, I imagine. 
Probably Diplodocus,** 

“Wrong. He wasn’t the biggest 
— just the longest. The biggest crea- 
tures ever to appear on Earth were 
the giant whales, and we extermin- 
ated them, around the beginning of 
the twenty-first century.” Couperin

hunched a little further over the ta- 
ble. “A couple of decades before we 
developed skills in biology adequate 
to find out what made them tick, ge- 
netically and otherwise, and preserve 
them in the new, inhospitable, made- 
over environment we’d wish on them. 
They weren’t simply hunted to death, 
though that did reduce the numbers 
far enough to allow them to give in 
to the other factors which were oper- 
ating. Effectively, we poisoned them. 
When they were weakened by poison 
disease did the rest 

“Right now, life here on Chryseis 
is going through a phase of extreme 
gigantism. It’s the first world of its 
kind we’ve run across, and it’s aston- 
ishingly close to Earth in so many 
chemical ways it holds the promise of 
millions of valuable clues to what we 
lost at home just before we learned 
to comprehend it. Tom, flip back to 
Shot 19, will you?” 

Tom Cheliki operated the projector 
table’s control dial, and the scene 
changed. Now, it showed a patch of 
ground with low-growing bushes and 
a scrawny reptilian creature browsing 
off them. 

Jeff looked down obediently, but 
after a moment shrugged. 

“That little baby,” Couperin said 
didactically, “corresponds to a rat in 
Earthside ecology, near as dammit. 
It’s a little over ten feet tall.” 

“What?” 

“No kidding, Commander. I said, 
and I mean, ‘extreme’ gigantism. 
Didn’t you see Dr. Kunje’s pride and 
joy?” 

“The disguise, floating in the trans- 
pex bubble?” 

“Precisely. Except that ‘stalking- 



horse’ would be a better term. That’s 
an exact replica of — Tom, give us 
Shot 63, please!” 

The scene in the table changed 
again; this time, it showed a typical 
specimen of the genus Jeff had al- 
ready seen, indistinguishable apart 
from the different distribution of the 
colored patches on its body and legs. 

“We studied five or six hundred 
examples of Macrodiscos polychro- 
mia chryseiana/* Ingrid explained, 
“and derived a computer-analyzed 
cross-section of it, to incorporate ev- 
ery known characteristic — the ap- 
pearance, the mode of gait, the gen- 
eral behavior, the smell it emits, even. 
Then we programmed for a carcass 
matching the description, with space 
inside it for one standard Advance 
Guard landing-globe. The idea be- 
ing — ” 

“The idea being,” Couperin cut in, 
“that Dr. Kunje is fanastically op- 
posed to anything, no matter how 
slight, which might interfere with the 
habits of the species under observa- 
tion. This whole job could easily 
be done with our own resources, by 
dropping remotes to the surface. But 
oh no! Dr. Kunje insists that the 
Macrodiscoi he observed at first hand 
by something which will pass as one 
of their own number.” 

“Tell me somthing,” Jeff said sud- 
denly. “Do you never refer to your 
boss except as Doctor Kunje?” 

The two scientists exchanged 
glances. After a moment, they both 
shook their heads. 

“Good grief,” Jeff said, wondering 
what it would be like to try and cope 
with his twelve-member crew on a 
basis of heel-clicking and cries of

Sahl instead of laughter, dirty jokes 
and a great display of overt affec- 
tion. He was brought back from his 
fit of speculation by Sandy playing 
footsy with him under the table, and 
he cleared his throat. 

“Ah — yes I Well, assuming the 
program for the stalking-horse in- 
cluded the proper specifications for 
implanting the landing-globe inside 
it, I don’t see why it shouldn’t work. 
There’s certainly plenty of room — 
one of our globes is approximately 
twenty-seven feet across with the 
force-shield in full operation.” 

“Dr. Kunje was very thorough 
about that,” Ingrid said. “You have to 
give her that: she’s always thorough. 
And the form of the Macrodiscos 
luckily lends itself to the plan. The 
generators are at the top of the globe, 
right? And the beastie is more or less 
suspended from a frame of bone with 
the nerve tissues running along the — 
ah — the ribs. But you’ve seen the 
actual model we’re going to use, so I 
don’t have to explain in detail.” 

CCQo the generators can plug di- 

O rectly into the nervous sys- 
tem,” Jeff nodded. “That’s neat. And 
I assume you have a program of op- 
eration we can simply slot into our 
own computers?” 

“Exactly.” 

“I see. Tom, chuck me the dial, 
will you?” Jeff reached out for the 
projector table controls and wiped 
the shot currently on display. “So it’s 
going to go like this,“ he continued, 
frowning a little because some of the 
details were still rather hazy, and 
manipulated the image within the ta- 
ble until it suggested, at least in out- 



line, one of the MacrodiscoL Into the 
middle of it, with the greater ease of 
long familiarity, he injected one of the 
Guard’s landing-globes: the central 
shaft first, housing the power-sources 
(tripled against emergency), then the 
three levels around which the shield 
projectors radiated blurred streaks of 
warning red, the uppermost housing 
weaponry, the central one available 
for observation, and the lowermost 
forming the most perfect extension of 
human reason yet devised, being as 
it was one huge solid-state computer 
into which the globe’s crew could di- 
rectly plug themselves simply by lay- 
ing their hands flat on the contact 
plates, before their chairs. Doing so 
was an eerie sensation, but it had its 
rewards; that, truly, was an extension 
of consciousness, and he had some- 
times suspected that a kind of addic- 
tion to it was what kept him on in 
the Advance Guard, trespassing on 
planet after inhospitable planet. 

He was rather proud of his ability 
to sketch with the unprogrammed 
controls of the projector table. He 
added some fine touches to his draw- 
ing — a recognizable caricature of 
Dr. Kunje, for example, on the mid- 
dle level, peering out with one hand 
raised to shade her eyes. 

“Don’t take all day, will you?” 
Sandy said caustically, and he caught 
himself with a guilty start. Trying to 
look as though nothing had happened, 
he removed his glass — which was 
now balanced on top of a peculiarly 
nasty little weapon built into the up- 
per level of the globe — and reduced 
its contents to nil. 

“Is that the general idea?” he asked 
Ingrid.

“Yes that’s fine,” she said after 
a few seconds’ contemplation. “I take 
it that means it can be done.” 

“Oh, snrel” 

“Jeff, just a second,” Sandy said, 
frowning now as she stared into the 
table. “Matthew, this is the boss spe- 
cies here — correct?” 

“No, not exactly,” Couperin coun- 
tered. “There are several others more 
widely spread over the planet, but 
this is by far the largest.” 

“How far is ‘far’?” 

“Ten or fifteen per cent.” 

“And what kind of terrain are we 
going to have to work over when we 
go down?” Sandy glanced up at him. 
“I don’t think I told you, but I’m 
supposed to be the planetside pilot 
for this crew, which means that when- 
ever we discharge a landing-globe I’m 
responsible.” 

“I’ll show you.” Couperin turned 
to Jeff. “Ah — Commander, do you 
mind if I wipe this drawing?” 

“Sure, sure! I only wanted to be 
certain I had the picture firmly in my 
mind. You needn’t bother to store it. 
Jeff passed over the control unit for 
the table. “And, by the way, stop 
calling me ‘Commander.’ I’ve decided 
I won’t take that kind of language 
from anyone except Dr. Kunje.” 
Couperin looked briefly puzzled, 
then smiled. He dialed for another 
picture, and the table produced a re- 
volving globe of Chryseis. 

“Here’s the territory where the 
Macrodiscoi hang out,” he said. A 
patch on one of the northern land 
masses flickered white. “As you prob- 
ably know, the year here is about 
seventeen months long, and the north- 
ern winter is just about ending now. 



The preliminary surveys caught the 
broad outline of the species’ summer 
habits, and we arrived in time to fol- 
low through their winter behavior in 
outline also. What we now want is 
the — ” 

“Don’t teU me,” Jeff cut in. “The 
fine detail. I get it. So what’s the lie 
of the land like and will you have 
another drink? Sandy!” 

“Mainly savannah. These creatures 
are herbivorous — oh, thanks very 
much, I will.” Couperin accepted his 
new drink and took a healthy swig. 
“Hah! Thank you — this is a very 
pleasant change from the monotonous 
stuff we get here.” 

4CXTOU get monotonous diets and 
A liquors?” Tom Cheliki said 
disbelievingly. 

“Liquors we get none of,” Ingrid 
said. “It’s — ah — not approved. Al- 
so it conduces to lax behavior. Not 
that one really needs to be conduced, 
of course, because hormones are by 
far the most potent substances yet 
devised to affect human instincts. 
Butr 

“I’m ^ad we called,” Jeff said 
after a moment of blank astonish- 
ment, and everyone burst out laugh- 
ing. 

“Jeff, if you don’t mind?” Sandy 
said, recovering before the others, 
and on his shrug continued: “This 
terrain, then! You say savannah? Any 
— oh — spring tornadoes? Earth- 
quakes? Major risks of that kind?” 

“No, it’s a pretty hospitable 
world,” Ingrid said. “We have the 
weather pattern down in detail, and it 
doesn’t include anything worse than 
the occasional gale. But calling this 

re

simply savannah is simplifying it a 
bit. There are rocky patches, and 
even some stretches of fairly respect- 
able forest. No tectonic activity worth 
mentioning in the range the Macro- 
discoi cover, though there’s a young 
continent emerging to the south — 
that one — and we have noted some 
faiiiy fierce temblors in the ridge to 
the east. However — ” 

**Commanderr 

The word splashed into the room 
like a rock tossed into wet mud, and 
they all winced and turned to the 
entrance. Dr. Kunje stood there, eyes 
once more like black ice-chips, but 
this time blazing. 

“Commander, I did not expect to 
have to gloss my instructions with this 
kind of detail, but I heard bawdy 
laughter echoing up the tube connect- 
ing this ship with the research sta- 
tion and I thought I had better see 
what caused such unseemly merri- 
ment. And what do I find? I find that 
I should have spelled out my distaste 
at the idea of any of my st^f taking 
drugs!” 

She pointed a shaking finger at the 
glass Jeff was holding. “That does, 
does it not, contain alcohol?** 

“Why, yes,” Jeff said. Denials 
seemed superfluous. “Mine contains 
an exact simulacrum of Polish vodka. 
Would you, perhaps, care for some- 
thing?” 

For long moments Dr. Kunje was 
speechless. Then, at last and painfully, 
she forced out, “I shall be so glad 
when the experience is over. And, be- 
lieve me, I no longer think it was a 
good idea to enlist the help of the Ad- 
vance Guard in a purely scientific 
project!” 

THE PRODUCT OF THE AAASSES 



She spun on her heel and marched 
away. The sound of her heels could 
be heard fading as she stamped along 
the gravity plates lining the floor of 
the umbilical tunnel. 

Eventually Jeff said, “I seem to 
have put you in dutch with your boss, 
don’t I?” 

“WeU, we do have to survive here 
for another three months minimum,” 
Couperin said, dutifully setting aside 
his glass, which was still three- 
quarters full. 

“What’s wrong with that woman?” 
Sandy burst out. “I understood she 
was a good biologist — doesn’t she 
know anything about the chemical 
side of human behavior?” 

“That, no,” Ingrid said, and gave 
her habitual wry chuckle, which made 
her plump body shake clear down to 
her calves. “We have a theory that 
she was fathered by a computer. Matt 
worked out the physical details, if 
you’d be interested . ?” 

“Oh, lovely!” Sandy exploded, 
planting both elbows on the projector 
table, details of the terrain on Chry- 
seis forgotten. “Do tell!” 

“Well, you see, it occurred to some 
of us that nobody with normal me- 
tabolism could be so utterly and en- 
tirely frigid,” Ingrid said. “So — oh. 
Matt, you take it from there. You 
worked out the program.” 

Couperin looked vaguely uncom- 
fortable. “It’s just a gag,” he said de- 
fensively. “But if you really want to 
know about it ... ? Well, I started 
by considering the subjective aspects, 
corresponding to signals generated in 
the human nervous system, if a com- 
puter of say quarter-megabrain ca- 
pacity were connected. ...”

W hen he had finished they were 
almost helpless with laughter; 
only Jeff retained a modicum of self- 
control, and he used it to shut the 
baffles in the umbilical tube and cut 
off the leakage of sound into the re- 
search station. 

“It’s practically literal!” Ingrid 
said, when she recovered from her 
hysteria. “Why . Why, just to take 
one example, Dr. Kunje doesn’t like 
to refer to the tubes which you use 
to link ships in orbit as ‘umbilical!* 
It brings to mind a process she’d 
rather forget about, even if the image 
is an exact one.” 

“But somebody like that is sick!” 
Tom Oheliki said, his mirth forgotten 
in an instant. 

“In what sense?” Couperin coun- 
tered. “She runs a first-rate sta- 
tion, there’s no denying. And she has 
the best record in xenobiology anyone 
could hope to stack up in a lifetime.” 
“She’s not functioning as a person, 
though,” Sandy said soberly. They 
were all suddenly not amused. “Jeff?” 
As commander of an Advance 
Guard ship, whose crew had to work 
in isolation for months at a time on 
the very fringes of human-explored 
space and often had to risk their 
lives on strange planets with no more 
reward than the occasional use of the 
consciousness-expanding facilities of a 
landing-globe, Jeff had to be both a 
flieoretical and a practical psycholo- 
He said after a pause for re- 
flection, “Yes, Sandy, I’m afraid 
youYe absolutely right.” 

“What sustains someone in that 
predicament?” Tom Cheliki demand- 



ed. The two scientists, strangers to 
the close, almost telepathic unity of a 
Guard ship’s crew, stared in bewil- 
derment, feeling that some conclusion 
had been reached which they did not 
know about. 

It had. 

“Being right,” Sandy said positive- 
ly “That so, Jeff?” 

“Yes. And there come a time when 
the personality is stretched like a rub- 
ber band — gets caught up in a Zeno 
Race. The tortoise never does beat 
Achilles, even if the logic says it 
does.” 

“What’s a Zeno Rape?” Ingrid de- 
manded. 

“What your boss is trapped in.” 
Jeff shook himself, as though coming 
back to the present from a long way 
off — and that also was partly true. 
“Someone who is not operating as a 
normal person can only be operating 
in accordance with a false idea of a 
normal person. That false idea is what 
we nickname a Zeno Race. You 
know the paradox of Achilles and 
the tortoise! When the tortoise has 
gone such a distance, Achilles starts 
to run, but when he gets where the 
tortoise was when he started it has 
moved on, and then when he — ” 

“Sure!” Couperin said impatiently. 

“Well, someone who has to be right 
in order to survive as a thinking per- 
son isn’t normal, is he — or she? 
Most human beings are wrong part 
of the time. Someone who depends on 
being right is trapped in a paradox 
like Zeno’s, having to be right and 
each time ^ding it more difficult to 
make it there ahead of the crowd. 
In fact, there always comes a time 
when the paradox resolves. And un-

less I’m mistaken, your boss just 
passed it. 

**Snapr 

Puzzled, Ingrid said, “But — ” 
“It’s just as well she called us in 
to land you a landing-globel” Tom 
Cheliki said, his face drawn and wor- 
ried. “You might not have spotted 
it. What do we do, Jeff?” 

“We let her be wrong,” Jeff shrug- 
ged and leaned back in his seat, 
cradling his drink. “What’s more, I 
think she’s already left out of ac- 
count the factor which is going to 
demonstrate that she can be wrong. 
Ingrid, didn’t you say something 
about your having been here through- 
out the period of winter on the 
Macrodiscoi*s range?” 

“Why — yes!” 

“You’ll have to edit me a bit, be- 
cause I’m not sufficiently grounded in 
xenobiology to know if the basic as- 
sumption is sound, but I suspect that 
when we put our landing-globe in- 
side your stalking-horse and go down, 
the following will. ...”

4 4 X Tow this is going to be perfect- 
ly ly straighforward,” Dr. Kunje 
said as she faced the assembled crew 
of the landing-globe: half members of 
the Guard, half members of her own 
staff with specific tasks to attend to 
during the descent and the stay on 
the surface. “Our surroundings may 
be unfamilar but our purpose is what 
it always is on visiting a new planet: 
to gather knowledge.” 

She glanced about her rather un- 
easily, as though oppressed by the 
blackness beyond the limits of the

globular shield protecting them. Out- 
side was the incredible internal 
nakedness of the facsimile Macrodis- 
cos they had built, its circulation, 
musculature and in fact every other 
organ, bar the digestive system, plain- 
ly visible, pushed into curious new re- 
lationships by the presence of the 
globe in place of the intestine-equiva- 
lents. Their stalking-horse would even 
be able to breathe, to economize on 
the power-sources within the globe. , 
which were not designed to make six- 
ty-odd tons of alien protoplasm gal- 
lop across a grassy plain at fqi^ty , 
miles an hour. 

“Finished?” Sandy said briskly 
from the control console. “Let’s go!” 

And, permitting Just a shade of ac- 
celeration to leak through the shield 
— enough to jar Dr. Kunje on her 
feet and interrupt her declaration that 
she had barely started to deliver her 
speech — she launched her weird 
craft into atmosphere. Outside the 
globe: the Macrodiscos, Outside the, 
Macrodiscos: a shield-unit to absorb 
and dissipate the friction due to diving 
through the air a trifle thicker than 
Earth’s, plus a computer with a single 
program and a homing device with a 
million-mile range. If something were 
to go wrong with the plan, they could 
abandon the carcass they hid inside 
and signal the external shield-unit to 
come and fetch them, fast. 

Not that Dr. Kunje was expecting 
any such eventuality; as she had 
stressed over and over again, their 
stalking-horse and the program whiqh 
was operating it were squarely found- 
ed on months of careful study of the 
Macodisconi and related species. 

But Jeff was. 

IQI 




K eeping his hands dutifully linked 
in his lap — no one but 
Sandy was supposed to touch the con- 
tact plates until she had set them safe- 
ly on solid ground — he glanced at 
Dr. Kunje in the adjacent chair. 

“Excited, doctoiT’ he suggested, 
noting how white her knuckles were 
from tension. 

“Why — yes, I suppose I am,” Dr. 
Kunje admitted with a trace of con- 
descension. “It’s always most grati- 
fying to see the culmination of a long 
plan of action working out exactly as 
predicted, isn’t it?” 

Jeff kept his thoughts on the sub- 
ject to himself and merely gave her 
an apparently confirmatory smile. 
But, past Dr. Kunje’s dark head, he 
saw Ingrid wink at him. 

“We’re coming down now,” Sandy 
reported suddenly. “The long-range 
detectors don’t indicate any sizeable 
animals in the immediate neighbor- 
hood. It’s roughly an hour before 
sunset at this point on the Macrodis- 
coVs range — is that all right. Dr. 
Kunje?” 

“Yes, that will do very well. The 
^ecies is mainly diurnal; the night 
will give us a chance to acclimatize 
ourselves and become acquainted with 
the lay of the land, before coming 
into overt contact with other mem- 
bers of the species.” 

“Very good,” Sandy said. “Fll 
touch down and strip away the shield 
unit — it’ll drift a couple of miles 
over our heads until we send for it 
again.” A pause, then: “There it 
goes!” 

Abruptly there was a landscape 
outside, lit by a low afternoon sun; 
they saw it by way of light-fiber 



bundles cunningly inserted between 
the muscles of the stalking-horse 
which projected their images on to 
curved screens outside the actual 
globe. Additionally, of course, they 
were able to perceive by way of the 
extensosensors attached to the com- 
puter inside the globe, and this Jeff 
proceeded to do, with an encouraging 
nod at Dr. Kunje and instructions to 
close her eyes. A moment to adjust, 
and then. 

It was like being the creature as 
well as himself, seeing the country- 
side from a height of twenty feet, 
hearing its noises, smelling its scents, 
and moreover being aware of the 
pressure of gravity, the heat of the 
sun, the multiple and bewildering po- 
sitions of the limbs carrying the huge 
oblate body within which they were 
hiding. With his own ears he heard 
Dr. Kunje utter an exclamation; the 
dry runs they had tried aboard the 
ship hadn’t prepared her for this. 

“You’ll get used to it,” he assured 
her. “Let’s go for a short stroll be- 
fore nightfall, shall we, Sandy? I 
think that’s a river-bank I see over to 
the left. We could try following that, 
to begin with.” 

In strict obedience to the com- 
puter parasitizing on its nervous sys- 
tem, the artificial Macrodiscos plod- 
ded on all its many feet in the 
indicated direction. As they rode 
along, Jeff confirmed what he had 
been told about the likeness of this 
planet to Earth, bar the size of the 
creatures inhabiting it. Grass, bushes, 
rocks, the color of the sun, all were 
astonishingly homelike. When they 
reached the river and were able to 
look down at it, they found that too

IF 




could have been on Earth — a partly 
dry, pebble-strewn channel along the 
bottom of which surged the first wa- 
ter released by the spring thaw in the 
mountains where it took its rise. 

Beside him Jeff heard a mutter 
which sounded suspiciously like a 
curse ^and glanced round at Dr. 
Kunje. She had withdrawn from con- 
tact with the computer and was shak- 
ing her head with a dazed expression. 
Fw want of a better idea, Sandy was 
turning the beast to follow the down- 
stream course of the river. 

“Is anything the matter?” Jeff 
murmured, taking pleasure he was a 
trifle ashamed of in repeating Dr. 
Kunje’s own words from the moment 
of his first encounter with the stalk- 
ing-horse. 

“It’s — it’s confusing at first, that’s 
all,” Dr. Kunje said with a glare and 
determinedly laid her hands on the 
contact plates again. “But I think I’m 
getting the hang of it,” she concluded 
firmly. 

“Attagirl,” Jeff said under his 
breath, and added, but not aloud: 
You want first-hand data, lady, we 
provide it for you! Don't blame us 
when you get what you asked for! 

’’Jeff!” Tom Cheliki said suddenly. 
“Isn’t that another of our own spe- 
cies, over there on tiie right?” 

“Yes!” Couperin, who had been ad- 
justing better than Dr. Kunje to the 
novd sensation of the contact plate 
before him, opened his eyes to seek 
the direct image of the other Macro- 
discos on the external screens. 

“So that’s what we look like at the 
moment!” Tom commented wryly. 
“ Tae see oorsel’s as ithers see us’ — 
hmmm!” 



“Not exactly,” Dr. Kunje cut in. 
“That one’s a male. You can tell it 
by the smaller size and generally light- 
er build, if you look carefully.” 

I t wasn’t the first time she had re- 
ferred to the greater bulk and 
stature of the female Macrodiscos. 
Jeff repressed the desire to give a 
thoughtful nod. But it was all fitting 
together. Something was definitely 
amiss in Dr. Kunje’s view of how to 
be human, and the more he learned 
about her, the more he was certain 
he had pinned down the problem. 
The cure was going to be both dras- 
tic and expensive, but that didn’t mat- 
ter. The Macrodiscos would be here 
next week or next year, awaiting 
study, but if things were to go on as 
at present. Dr. Kunje might not be 
— and people with her degree of bril- 
liance in xenobiology were few and 
far between. 

Seeing that she had closed her eyes 
and set her mouth in a taut line of 
concentration, he was able to signal 
silently to Sandy, whose head tilted to 
a mischievous angle. Their steed 
came to a halt. ^ 

“Why have you stopped?” Dr. 
Kunje said, eyes still tight shut as 
she had fought to absorb and under- 
stand the wealth of sensory data fur- 
nished by the computer. 

“Ought we not make certain at 
the first opportunity that other mem- 
bers of the species don’t perceive any- 
thing wrong with our version of 
them?” Jeff said, 

^Oh ^ — yes, I see. Yes, that’s a 
sensible precaution. Has the male no- 
ticed us yet?” 

“He surely has,” Couperin said. 

IP 




“And what’s more, here he comes!” 

A quarter-mile distant across the 
irregular ground, the monster — 
smaller only by comparison, for he 
was himself at least forty-eight feet 
across and fifteen feet high — had 
tensed into an alert attitude. All of 
a sudden, his multiple legs began to 
propel him violently in their direc- 
tion. 

“That’s the aggression-reaction!” 
Dr. Kunje exclaimed. “But what in 
the . ?” Her voice tailed away, 

“Aggression-reaction?” Sandy re- 
peated. “You mean we ought to get 
out of here?” 

“Well ...” Dr. Kunje opened her 
eyes and stared helplessly at the rapid- 
ly growing mass of the male as it ap- 
proached. “Well — yes, I suppose we 
should!” 

Compliantly, Sandy instructed their 
steed to move away, but the male 
wasn’t to be shaken off. At a speed 
between a plod and a gallop, which 
became a bit uncomfortable after a 
while because they were having to al- 
low acceleration forces to affect the 
interior of the globe — there was no 
choice short of lifting the entire crea- 
ture off the ground with their anti- 
gravs — they fled across the hillocky 
plain, sometimes avoiding, sometimes 
charging straight through, the clumps 
of vegetation which dotted it. 

“There’s another!” Ingrid said ab- 
ruptly, and they all noticed that a 
second male had come into view. Its 
reaction was identical with the first’s: 
it tensed, hesitated and then charged. 

Nobody said anything for a while, 
as Sandy expertly operated the mus- 
cles of their steed. T^en a third male 
appeared and did the same as the 



others. Sandy contrived to make two 
of the three collide as they both tried 
to cut off the same corner around a 
stand of tall trees, and they forgot the 
chase in favor of a kind of butting 
contest, hurling their massive frames 
at one another with the full force of 
all their limbs. But the remaining 
male kept on coming, and inside five 
minutes there was yet a fourth, dis- 
covered as they rounded an outcrop 
of weathered rocks. 

“This isn’t precisely what, I was led 
to expect,” Jeff said delicately. 

“N-no — ah — no, it isn’t,” Dr. 
Kunje said with tremendous effort. 
“Oh my goodness! There’s another!” 
She pointed a shaking hand, and she 
was quite right. One more male had 
joined the pursuit, this one smaller 
than the rest and correspondingly bet- 
ter able to dodge and twist as he ran. 

“Head for the sunset line,” Dr. 
Kunje said in a depressed voice. “As 
I told you, they’re diurnal. Darkness 
should enable us to — ah — re-assess 
our position.” 

44Tt certainly seems to need reas- 

A sessment,” Tom Cheliki said in 
a tone of disapproval. “I understood 
that disguised as we are we could 
venture among these animals without 
causing any disturbance to their reg- 
ular activities, instead of which the 
mere sight of us seems to provoke a 
clear intention to do us serious may- 
hem!” 

“Look out!” Sandy shouted. Their 
course had taken them back to the 
river, at a point where it had cut it- 
self a miniature gorge, about forty or 
fifty feet high, and she had attempted 
to dodge through the gap. At the

same moment one of the pursuing 
males, displaying improbable powers 
o£ reasoning, had scuttled up the bank 
and clearly planned to jump down di- 
rectly on top of thenoL Only by caus- 
ing their steed to give a frantic leap, 
to the ground was it possible to avoid 
the impact. The male slammed to the 
ground in a thrashing tangle of 
£mbs, and a less farsighted member 
of the posse ran straight into him, 
provoking the inception of another 
butting contest. 

For a short time thereafter, with 
the sun slanting closer to the horizon 
and the sky darkling, they seemed to 
be on their own again, and for fear of 
overstressing the muscles she was con- 
iroliing Sandy slowed down their 
headlong run. Shortly, however, one 
of the males they had left behind re- 
appeared on their trail, moving awk- 
wardly and dragging one of its legs, 
but determined not to give up. 

“Here we go again,” Sandy said in 
a resigned tone and added in a voice 
that had suddenly changed, “Oh no! 
There’s a great big patch of woodland 
ahead of us! We can’t just charge 
steaight through it, can we?” 

Definitely they could not: enor- 
mous or not by Earthly standards, 
oven a fuligrown female Macrodiscos 
liad to draw the line before trying to 
brush six-foot tree trunks out of the 
way like blades ot grass. 

“So what do we do, Dr. Kunje?” 
Jeff said in a tone as sweet as 
honey. 

“I . ” Dr. Kunje put her hand 
to her head as though dizzy. “I . ” 
«he said again, and finally, with a 
miserable cry, managed to finish the 
sentence. just don't know!" 



“Dr. Swann?” Jeff said. 

“We could try merely holding off the 
pursuit until dark,” Ingrid said doubt- 
fully. “It’s perfectly true that these 
things prefer to quiet down at night- 
fall” 

“I’ll do my best,” Sandy promised, 
and thereafter there followed a kind 
of weird game of tag, as she hurled 
the colossal mass of their steed back 
and forth among the fringes of the 
forest. Twice she managed to crash 
the blundering male into a tree, so 
that there was an earth-shaking trem- 
or and a brief respite, but before 
the determined beast was finally out 
of the running one of the others 
which they had earlier left behind 
put in an appearance and joined the 
chase. Then another fresh one showed 
up, and things went completely out of 
control. Wherever Sandy headed for, 
there was one of the animals ahead. 

Darkness settled over the land, and 
contrary to what had been promised, 
the pursuit did not slacken for a 
moment. Jeff kept glancing at Dr. 
Kunje, making it clear that he ex- 
pected her to say something, and at 
long last, with face white and lips 
trembling, she forced it out. 

“I’m sorry! Something must have 
gone wrong — terribly wrong! Per- 
haps they can sense that this isn’t a 
member of their own species in some 
way we never guessed at!” 

“You mean we should abandon the 
attempt and make another try on 
some other occasion?” Jeff suggested. 

“I — ah — I can’t even see that 
another try — ” Dr. Kunje gesteed 
helplessly. “Oh, but the whole thing’s 
absurd! I don’t understand! Let’s just 
get out of hare!”

“Sandyl” Jeff said quietly, and 
Sandy, shrugging, prepared to <^ard 
the stalking-horse. Its iindMrella-like 
upper frame of bones parted, peeled 
back, and allowed the landing-globe 
to drift free as the carcass collapsed 
to the ground. Skillfully she guided 
the gleaming sphere in among the 
trees on the fringe of the forest, and 
at last signaled for the shield-unit 
hovering overhead to come and fetch 
them back to orbit. 

“I don’t understand!” Dr. Kunje 
whispered. “Oh, this is awful! I was 
so sure it was going to work — we 
spent months planning this and we 
double-checked everything. Com- 
mander, what can possibly have gone 
wrong?” 

“Stop calling me that,” Jeff said in 
a tone of deliberate crossness. 
don’t even allow my own crew to 
call me that” 

“Wh-what?” Dr. Kunje blinked at 
him, and the brightness in her eyes 
trickled over and began to course 
down her cheeks. 

Drastic, but essential, 

F rom the corner of his own eye 
Jeff saw that Ingrid and Couper- 
in were both looking rather embar- 
rassed, as though regretting that they 
had committed themselves to what 
they had done. But something of the 
sort was inescapable; the alternative 
was for Dr. Kunje to be stretched and 
broken on the rack of her own need 
to be infallible. 

He said, “What are the males do- 
ing now, Tom?” 

Tom Cheliki set his hands on the 
contact plate before him. “Ah . 
Sort of snuffing around the empty 



carcass, as near as I can tell. One 
of them has drifted off already. It 
seems to be angry about something. 
At any rate, it’s pulling at trees and 
bushes as it goes by, trying to uproot 
them. It looks exactly like someone 
having a temper-tantrum.” 

“I’m not surprised,” Jeff said dry- 
ly. “Listen, Dr. Kunje! I want you to 
answer me a couple of questions. First 
off, how old are you?” 

“What in the galaxy has that got 
to do with — ?” 

“I asked a question!” Abruptly, 
Jeff’s voice was colored with the qual- 
ity which had made him commander 
of an Advance Guard crew, a dozen 
of the most cantankerous, self-willed 
and unpredictable specimens ever 
produced by the cantankerous, self- 
willed and unpredictable species they 
belonged to. Dr. Kunje’s resistance 
faded into nothing. 

“Ah . I’m thirty-five. But I don’t 
see why — ” 

“And at thirty-five have you ever 
been in love with anybody? Have 
you ever been in love?'* 

Indignation flared in her face. 
“Really, Commander! I don’t think 
you have any right — ” 

“I said quit calling them that,” Jeff 
grunted. “All right, I’ll take that for 
a negative. It explains how you 
could be so stupid as to think you 
were wrong when in fact you were 
absolutely, totally and excessively 
right” 

There was an eternal pause. At 
last she said weakly, “I was — was 
right?" 

“Of course. You’re too damned 
good a biologist not to have been, 
aren’t you? But because you’re such

a lousy human being — shut up and 
wait tor me to finish! — because 
you’re a lousy human being you over- 
looked something that even a com- 
plete layman like myself spotted im- 
mediately. I’ll spell it out for you, 
since apparently you still haven’t 
caught on.” 

Jeff drew a deep breath. 

“This planet’s animal life is pretty 
close to Earth’s, correct? Bisexual, 
oxygen-breathing, all the rest of it. 
And as a result of winter-long obser- 
vations of the Macrodiscoi you had 
a facsimile prepared of a female of 
that species which combined all the 
optimum characteristics you’d noted 
from your study of them, right? No, 
you didn’t actually say that to me, 
but I figured it out from your in- 
sistence on the larger size of the fe- 
males. You ordered all the best fea- 
tures of the ones you’d studied com- 
bined in this artificial version. True 
or false?” 

“Well, naturally, if we wanted to 
— ” Dr. Kunje began. 

“Wait for it! And then “when we 
actually tried to go out among the 
Macrodiscoi without being observed, 
and a gang of males fell in behind and 
tried to grab us by the tail, you 
thought they’d detected the fake and 
were attacking us, didn’t you? Great 
Galaxies, woman, hadn’t it occurred to 
you that this is spring?** 

He waited for it to sink in. When 
he had seen the first light of compre- 
hension dawn on her face, he gestured 
for Sandy to allow the shield-unit to 
settle over the landing-globe and 
carry them away to orbit; she had 
been holding it off to give him a 
chance to hit Dr. Kunje with the 



truth while she was most vulnerable. 

“Honestly, Leila!” He used her 
first name before adding the final 
clincher, for good psychological rea- 
sons. “What do you think would 
happen if you programed a computer 
to simulate an optimum woman? You 
think you could wander about on 
Earth without attracting attention? 
Of course not! Those males who fell 
in behind and who couldn’t be shaken 
off weren’t trying to attack us! All 
they wanted to do was exactly what 
you’d expect them to want in the 
breeding season. They wanted to 
make love!” 

Leila Kunje put her head in her 
hands and burst into agonizing sobs. 

V 

4 4XTTell, I suppose all I can say 
Vy is thanks very much,” In- 
grid said as she shook Jeff’s hand pri- 
or to the departure of the Guard ship. 
“But I mean a lot more than just 
that. I have a feeling that from now 
on Leila is going to be a hell of a 
sight more human to work with.” 
“Don’t push her,” Sandy said from 
behind Jeff. “It takes an awfully long 
time to re-integrate a personality that’s 
wandered as far out of orbit as hers 
had. But I think you’re going to be 
right in the long term.” 

“Oh, she has plenty of props,” Jeff 
said. It isn’t everyone in that pre- 
dicament who’s shown what’s wrong 
by being excessively right. That ought 
to give her a lifeline to follow out of 
her present depression.” 

“How long is it going to take to 
prepare the new male version of the 
stalking-horse?” Tom Cheliki aSked.

“About a month, I imagine,” 
Couperin said. “By which time the 
fury of the mating season will be 
over, and we can conduct our obser- 
vations under — ah — more relaxed 
conditions. Are you going to come 
back and let us borrow one of your 
landing-globes again?” 

Jeff grinned and shook his head. 
“No, I*m afraid our visit was a trau- 
matic experience for Leila. It would 
be better to call in another Guard 
ship for the second attempt.” 

There was a pause. Suddenly In- 
grid put her arms around him and 
gave him a smacking kiss on the 
cheek. ''Thafs more like what I want- 
ed to convey to you,” she said with

WHAT HAS GONE BEFORE 



Mount Lookitthat the planet is a 
Venus-sized world circling Tau Cetu 
Its only habitable area is a not par- 
ticularly flat Plateau half the size of 
California, set on top of Mount Look- 
itthat the mountain, forty miles above 
the hellish heat and pressure at the 
planet's true surface. 

For three hundred years the colony 



on Mount Lookitthat has been a two- 
class system, dominated by the 
**crew,” with the colonists under- 
neath. The heart of the colony is the 
Hospital, an amorphous structure 
which incorporates the two slow- 
boats that once carried men to the 
planet. One function of the Hospital 
is Implementation, the army-and- 



no 





police of Mount Lookitthat, led by 
JESUS PIETRO CASTRO as Head. 
CASTRO, who is half colonist, is 
supervised by MILLARD PARLET- 
TE, nearly two hundred years old 
and pure crew. 

Another function of the Hospital 
is the organ banks. Colonists accused 
of crimes are taken apart for the or- 
gan banks, which are used to cure 
the sick. Mainly they benefit the 
crew. Most medicine on Mount Look- 
itthat involves the organ banks. 

The ramrobots come only when 
Earth's latest discovery is such that 
it cannot be sent as information in a 
laser beam. This holds in particular 
for items of biological engineering, 
of which Mount Lookitthat has 
many: indoor grass, housecleaners, 
architectural coral, mining worms, 
and so forth. 

The SONS OF EARTH, a rebel 
organization, correctly suspect that 
Ramrobot #143 is something special, 
though only MILLARD PARLETTE 
knows its full importance. Their at- 
tempt to capture the ramrobot pack- 
age backfires. They lose the package. 
POLLY TOURNQUIST gets pic- 
tures; but her attempt to show them 
at the rebel meeting the next night 
is interrupted by an Implementation 
raid. 

Cover for the meeting was a party 
thrown by HARRY KANE, leader 
of the rebels. MATTHEW LEIGH 
KELLER, accidentally invited to the 
party, was the only one to escape the 
raid. This is common; people usually 
ignore MATT KELLER when he 
doesn*t want to be noticed. 

The next morning Matt, returning 
to the wrecked house, finds a car 



buried in the basement. He has never 
flown a car; but he manages to reach 
the vicinity of the Hospital without 
being killed, though he loses the car 
in the process. The weird results of 
his first attempt to sneak into the 
Hospital make him determined to 
ask JAY HAWK HOOD, who is 
something of an expert, about psi 
powers. But Hood is one of the peo- 
ple he*s trying to rescue. 

His second attempt succeeds, but 
even more strangely. MATT is ex- 
ploring the Hospital when he stum- 
bles into the organ banks. This throws 
him off balance entirely, and he 
makes no attempt to defend himself 
when a guard stuns him and carts 
him off to join the others in the 
vivarium. 

CASTRO has been busy. JJe^s 
questioned several Sons of Earth and 
sent them to the organ banks; he's 
got POLLY TOURNQUIST under- 
going the coffin cure: sensory depri- 
vation. Next morning, having follow- 
ed the odd circumstances of MATT'S 
capture, he sends for MATT to be 
questioned. 

Ninety-eight prisoners are in the 
Vivarium, sleeping under stimulus of 
the brain's sleep center. Two guards 
waken MATT, handcuff him and 
lead him off. In the corridor they 
suddenly forget about him. Matt re- 
turns to the vivarium and starts wak- 
ing prisoners. 

Despite spectacular damage done 
on the way, the subsequent escape is 
a near-failure. Only MATT KEL- 
LER, JAY HOOD, HARRY KANE 
and a middle-aged harridan named 
LYDIA HANCOCK escape under 
cover of MATTs odd anonymity. 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



111 




POLLY TOURNQUIST wasn^t even 
in the vivarium. They take cover in 
an unoccupied house belonging to 
one of MILLARD PARLETTEs vir- 
tiial army of relatives. 

While CASTRO becomes more 
and more worried — is he being 
plagued by ghosts? — whafs left of 
the Sons of Earth tries to figure out 
what makes *Uhe luck of Matt Kellef* 
work. Unexpectedly, MILLARD 
PARLETTE himself appears on the 
scene, LYDIA stuns him, unfortun- 
ately; he seemed eager to talk to 
HARRY KANE. 

HOOD*s analysis of MATTs pow- 
er is as follows: 

MATT has a limited form of tele- 
pathy, related only to the optic nerve, 
which is brain tissue. He can con- 
tract the iris of someone else's eye, 
causing that person to lose interest 
in whatever he is looking at, particu- 
larly if he is looking at MATT KEL- 
LER. To work the psi power, MATT 
has to be afraid. 

For MATT, this clears up a lot of 
his history. It also makes him aware 
of his need to rescue POLLY 
TOURNQUIST, assuming she isn*t 
in the organ banks. He accepts 
LANEY*s help, with the reservation 
that LANEY will be trying to free 
the vivarium prisoners once they are 
inside. 

They breach the Hospital wall, us- 
ing explosives buried earlier by the 
Sons of Earth. But once inside, Laney 
and Matt accidentally become sepa- 
rated. 

CASTRO has been increasing the 
HospitaVs defenses. He definitely ex- 
pects an attack; but of what? MATTs 
abnormal abilities, plus the bleeding- 



heart symbol MATT left in the vi- 
varium, drawn in human blood, have 
CASTRO half convinced that he is 
being attacked by a ghost. Even 
LANEY can only guess at his new 
defenses. 

At the house, MILLARD PAR- 
LETTE recovers from the sonic stun 
attack. He speaks at length, describing 
the contents of the ramrobot package. 
Briefly, they are four items of bio- 
logical engineering turned to medical 
purposes. They offer alternatives to 
organ transplant. PARLETTE does 
his best to convince HARRY KANE 
and the remnant of the Sons of Earth, 
that the arrival of Ramrobot #143 
has blown the present social order 
sky high. 

The rule of the crew, he says, is 
doomed.

L aney had vanished around to the 
left, around the great gentle curve 
of the Planck, while Matt stood gap- 
ing. He started after her, then checked 
himself. She must know of another 
entrance; he’d never catch her be- 
fore she reached it. And if he fol- 
lowed her through he’d be lost in the 
maze of the Hospital. 

But he had to find her. She’d kept 
him in the dark as much as she 
could . probably because she ex- 
pected Castro to get him and didn’t 
want him to spill anything important. 
She hadn’t mentioned the bomb until 
the fuse was in her hand; nor the 
detailed plans for invading the Hos- 
pital until she was already following 
them. 

Eventually she’d have told him 

IF 



112 




how to find Polly. Now he’d lost 
both. 

Or ... ? 

He ran toward the main entrance, 
dodging police who tried to run 
through Ws solid bulk. He would 
meet Laney at the vivarium, if she 
got there. But he knew only one route 
to reach it. 

The great bronze doors swung open 
as he approached. Matt hesitated at 
the bottom of the wide stairs. Elec- 
tric eyes? Then three uniformed men 
trotted through the entrance and 
down, and Matt trotted up between 
them. If there were electric eyes here, 
and men watching them, they could 
never keep track of the last minute’s 
traffic. 

The doors swung shut as he went 
through. They almost caught him be- 
tween them. He cursed in a whisper 
and stepped aside for a r unning po- 
liceman with a whistle in his mouth. 
Like the ultra-sonic whistle the gate- 
man had used to get in last night. 
He’d need one to get out. But later. 
He needn’t think about leaving yet. 

His legs ached savagely. He slowed 
to a brisk walk and tried not to 
pant. 

Rishty up a flighty take a righty then 
a left .... 

VIVARIUM. 

He saw the door down the corri- 
dor, and he stopped where he was 
and sagged gratefully against the wall. 
He’d beaten her here. And he was 
horribly tired. His legs were numb; 
there was a singing in his head; he 
wanted to do nothing but breathe. A 
taste in his mouth and throat re- 
minded him of the hot metal taste of 
the void mist, when he’d bored for 



the bottom less than thirty-six plateau 
hours ago. It seemed he’d been run- 
ning forever, terrified forever. His 
blood had carried adrenalin for too 
long. The wall felt soft against his 
back. 

It was good to rest. It was good 
to breathe. It was good to be warm, 
and the Hospital walls were warm, 
almost too warm for a cold-weather 
crewish overjacket. He’d ditch it 
when it got too hot .... Probing 
idly in his pockets, he found a double 
handful of unshelled roasted peanuts. 

C orporal Halley Fox rounded the 
comer and stopped. He saw a 
crew resting against a wall, wearing 
his overjacket indoors. There was a 
ragged tear in the crew’s ear, and a 
pool of blood below it, soaked into 
the neck of his overjacket. He was 
cracking and eating peanuts, dropping 
the shells on the floor. 

It was strange, but not strange 
enough. 

Halley Fox was in the third gener- 
ation of a family which traditionally 
produced Implementation police. Nat- 
urally he had joined Implementation. 
His reflexes were not quick enough 
to make him a raider, and he made 
a better follower than a leader. For 
eight years now, he had been a com- 
petent man in a good position which 
did not require much responsibility. 

Then . last night he’d caught a 
colonist invading the Hospital. 

This morning there’d been a break 
from the vivarium, the first since the 
vivarium was built. Corporal Fox 
had seen blood for the first time. 
Man’s blood, not drained into an 
organ-bank tank, but spilled reckless-

ly along a hallway in conscious, mur- 
derous violence. 

This evening the Head had warned 
of an impending attack on the Hos- 
pital. He’d practically ordered Cor- 
poral Fox to shoot his own fellow 
guards! And everyone was taking him 
seriously! 

Minutes ago, there’d been a hell 
of a big blast outside the windows 
. and half the guards had deserted 
their posts to see what had happened. 

Corporal Fox was slightly punch 
drunk. 

He had not deserted his post. 
Things were confused enough. He 
stuck to his training as something he 
knew to be solid. And when he saw 
a crew sitting against a wall eating 
peanuts, he saluted and said, “Sir.” 

Matt looked up to see a police of- 
ficer standing stiff as a board, hold- 
ing the short barrel of a mercy-bullet 
pistol slantwise across his forehead. 

Effectively he disappeared. 

C orporal Fox continued down the 
hall, stepping wide around the 
vivarium door. At the end of the 
corridor he stopped, half turned, and 
fell. 

Matt got unsteadily to his feet. The 
sight of the guard had damn near 
stopped his heart. 

Laney came around fast. She saw 
Matt, dodged back, poked the gun 
around — 

“Stop! It’s me!” 

“Oh, Matt. I thought I’d lost you.” 
He moved toward her. “I saw 
someone come after you. Did you 
get him?” 

“Yah.” She looked down at Cor- 
poral Fox. “They’re badly trained.” 



“Where’d you learn to shoot like 
that?” 

“Never you mind. Come on.” She 
moved back toward the vivarium. 
“Hold it. Where do I find Polly?” 
“I really don’t know. We’ve never 
known where they administer the 
coffin cure.” She reached for the 
door handle. Matt caught her wrist. 
“Come now. Matt,” she said. “You 
had fair warning.” 

“The door’s booby-trapped.” 

“Oh?” 

“I saw the way that guy walked 
around it.” 

She frowned at the handle. Then, 
with effort, she tore a strip from the 
bottom of Matt’s jacket. She tied it 
to the handle, moved back as far as 
it would reach. 

Matt backed away. He said, “Be- 
fore you do something irrevocable, 
won’t you please tell me where to 
find Polly?” 

“Honestly, Matt, I don’t know.” 
She wasn’t trying to hide the fact that 
he was an unneeded distraction. 
“Okay, where’s Castro’s office?” 
“You’re out of your mind.” 

“I’m a fanatic. Like you.” 

That got a grin. “You’re crazy, but 
okay. You go back the way I came, 
turn the only way you can and go 
up another flight. Follow the hall 
until you see signs. The signs will 
take you the rest of the way. The 
office is up against the hull of the 
Planck, But if you stick with me, 
we may find an easier way.” 

“PuU then.” 

Laney pulled. 

The handle came down and click- 
ed. Immediately something fired from 
the ceiling: a conical burst of mercy- 

IF 



114 




bullets spattering the area where any- 
one would have stood to pull the 
handle. And a siren blared in the 
corridor, loud and raucous and famil- 
iar. 

Laney jumped straight back in sur- 
prise, fetched up against the wall. The 
door swung open a couple of inches. 
“In,” she cried, and dove through, 
followed by Matt. 

The puffs of mercy-bullets were 
lost in the sound of the siren. But 
Matt saw four men in the room, 
crouched in target-shooting position 
in a line opposite the door. They were 
still firing as Laney fell. 

( i T^oomed? Really?” Even to 
himself Harry sounded in- 
sane. But he’d expected no such easy 
capitulation. 

“How many Sons of Earth are 
there?” 

“I can’t tell you that.” 

“I can tell you,” said Millard Par- 
lette. “Less than four hundred. On 
all of Mount Lookitthat there are less 
than seven hundred active rebels. For 
three hundred years you and your 
kind have been trying to build a 
rebellion. You’ve made no progress 
at all.” 

“Precious little.” 

“You enlist your rebels from the 
colonists, naturally. Your trouble is 
that most colonists don’t really want 
the crew to lose control of the Pla- 
teau. They’re happy the way they are. 
Yours is an unpopular cause. I tried 
to explain why before; let me try 
again.” With obvious effort he moved 
his arms enough to fold his hands in 
his lap. Random muscles in his 
shoulders twitched from time to time. 



“It’s not that they don’t think they 
could do better than the crew if it 
came to the point. Everybody always 
thinks that. They’re afraid of Imple- 
mentation, yes, and they won’t risk 
their good blood and bone to make 
the change, not when Implementation 
has all the weapons on Plateau and 
controls all the electrical power too. 

“But that isn’t the point. The point 
is that they don’t really think that the 
crew rule is wrong,** 

“It all depends on the organ banks. 
On the one hand, the organ banks 
are a terrible threat, not only a death 
penalty, but an ignominious way to 
die. On the other hand, the banks 
are a promise. A man who deserves 
it and can pay for it, even a colonist, 
can get medical treatment at the Hos- 
pital. But without the organ banks 
there’d be no treatment. He’d die.” 

“Do you know what your rebels 
would do if they could beat the crew 
to their knees? Some would insist 
that the organ banks be abolished. 
They’d be killed or ostracized by 
their own members. The majority 
would keep the banks just as they are, 
but use the crew to feed them!” 

His neck was stronger now, and 
he looked up to see patient stares. A 
good audience. And he had them 
hooked finally. 

“Up to now,” he went on, “you 
couldn’t start a rebellion because you 
couldn’t convince enough fighting 
men that your cause was just. Now 
you can. Now you can convince the 
colonists of Mount Lookitthat that 
the organ banks are and should be 
obsolete. Then wait a little. When 
Implementation doesn’t disband, you 
move.”

Harry Kane said, “That’s exactly 
what I was thinking, only you seem 
to be way ahead of me. Why did you 
call me silly?” 

“You made a silly assumption. 
You thought I was trying to keep the 
ramrobot package a secret. Quite the 
contrary. Just this afternoon I — ” 
‘Tve finally got it,” said Hood. 
“You’ve decided to join the winning 
side, have you, Parlette?” 

“You fool. You badmouthed col- 
onist fool.” 

J ay Hood flushed. He stood per- 
^ctly straight with his arms at his 
sides and his fists clenched. He was 
no angrier than Parlette. The old man 
was trying to shift his weight, and 
every muscle in his body was jumping 
as a result. He said, “Do you think 
so little of me, to think I’d follow 
such motives?” 

“Relax, Jay. Parlette, if you have 
something to say, say it. If we jump 
to the wrong conclusions, please as- 
sume that you’re expressing yourself 
badly and don’t try to shift the 
blame.” 

“Why don’t you all count to infin- 
ity?” Lydia Hancock suggested. 

Parlette spoke slowly and evenly. 
“I am trying to prevent a blood bath. 
Is that clear enough for you? I’m try- 
ing to prevent a civil war that could 
kin half the people in this world.” 
“You can’t do it,” said Harry 
Kane. “It’s coming.” 

“Kane, cannot you and I and your 
associates work out a new . • con- 
stitution for Mount Lookitthat? Ob- 
viously the Covenant of Planetfall 
will no longer work.” 

“Obviously.” 



“I made a speech today. In fact, I 
seem to be spending the whole damn 
day and night making speeches. This 
afternoon I called an emergency ses- 
sion — rammed it through the Coun- 
cil. You know what that means?” 

“Yah. You were talking to every 
crew on the Plateau, then.” 

“I told them what was in Ram- 
robot #143. I showed them. I told 
them about the organ-bank problem, 
and about the relationship between 
ethics and technology. 1 told them 
that if the secret of the ramrobot ever 
reached the colonists, the colonists 
would revolt en masse. I did my 
damnedest, Kane, to scare the pants 
off them.” 

“I’ve known from the beginning 
that we couldn’t keep the secret for- 
ever. Now that thirty thousand peo- 
ple know it it’ll be out even faster, 
even if we were all killed this instant. 
I did all this, Kane, in order to warn 
them. To scare them. When they re- 
alize that the secret is out, they may 
be scared enough to dicker. The 
smart ones will. 

“I’ve been planning this a long 
time, Kane. I ^dn’t even know what 
it was that Earth would ship us. It 
might have been a regeneration ser- 
um, or designs for cheap alloplasty 
components, or even a new religion. 
An}rthing. But something was com- 
ing, and here it is; and, K^e, we’ve 
got to try to stop the blood bath.” 
Gone was Parlette’s shortness of 
breath and his clumsy attempts to 
make his lips and tongueVork against 
a sonic blast. His voice was smooth 
and lilting, rising and falling, a little 
hoarse, but terribly earnest. “We’ve 
got to try. Maybe we can find some- 

IF 



116 




thing both the crew and the colonists 
can agree on.” 

He stopped, and three heads nod- 
ded, almost in reflex. 

XXI 

H e saw the four men, and he saw 
Laney stagger. He tried to turn 
and run, and in that instant there was 
a godawful clang, a sound like being 
inside a church bell. He jumped to 
the side instead, knowing the hall 
must be full of sonics. 

“Shut the damn door I” a voice 
yelled. One of the guards jumped to 
obey. Matt felt the numbness of the 
sonics, and his knees went watery. 
He kept his eyes on his four enemies. 

One bent over Laney. “All alone,” 
he said. “Crazy. Wonder where she 
got the clothes?” 

“Off a crew, maybe.” 

Another guard laughed brayingly. 
“Shut up, Rick. Come on, lend a 
hand. Let’s get her to a chair.” 

“A hunting gun. Wouldn’t you 
hate to get shot with this?” 

- “She came a long way to get to the 
vivarium. Most of ’em we have to 
bring.” 

The braying laugh again. 

“Gas bomb didn’t go off.” One of 
the guards kicked a metal cannister. 
Immediately the cannister began hiss- 
ing. “Nose plugs, quick!” 

They fumbled in their pockets, 
produced things that looked like large 
rubber false noses. 

“Good. We should have done this 
before. If we keep the room filled 
with gas, anyone who comes charging 
in will drop right away.” 

Matt had gotten the message. He’d 



held his breath from the moment he 
heard the hiss. Now he walked up to 
the nearest guard and wrenched his 
false nose away. The man gasped in 
surprise, looked directly at Matt and 
crumpled. 

The false nose had a band to fit 
around the neck, and some kind of 
adhesive to form a skin-tight lock 
around the nose. Matt got it on and 
found himself breathing through it,, 
with difficulty. It was not comfort- 
able. 

“Rick? Oh, that idiot. Where the 
Mist Demons is his nose plug?” 

“I’ll bet the jerk forgot to bring it/’ 

“Get me Major Jansen, please.”; 
One of the guards was using his hand- = 
phone. “Sir? A girl just tried to crasli 
the vivarium. Yes, a girl, a crew girl 
in colonists clothing .... That’s 
right, just one .... She’s sleeping 
in one of the seats, sir. We figured : 
as long as she’d gone to all that 
trouble getting here — ” 

Matt still felt dizzy, though the 
door must be blocking the vibrations 
of the big sonics. Had he been hit 
by an unnoticed mercy-bullet? 

He bent over Laney. She was out 
of it, for sure. Punctured by far too 
many anesthetic slivers, her lungs fill- 
ed with gas, a rhythmic sleep-induc- 
ing current playing through her brain 
. ? 

He found three wires leading to 
her headset. He pulled them. 

Now she was a time bomb. When 
everything else wore off, she’d wake 
up. More of a firecracker, actually, 
with four armed guards in the room. 

“One more thing, sir. The place 
is full of gas. It’s just as well, we 
think.”

“No, sir, we haven’t. If you’ll turn 
off the sonics, I’ll look.” He turned 
from the phone. “Watts, check in the 
hall and see if anybody dropped dead 
out there.” 

“But the sonics are still goingl” 
“They should be off. Try it,” 

A ballpoint pen peeped from the 
shirt pocket of the unconscious 
guard. Matt saw it, snatched it and 
drew rapidly: a heart on the guard’s 
forehead, t^ee drops running down 
the straight bridge of the nose. 

The one called Watts opened the 
door a crack. No sonic numbness 
touched him. He opened it further. 
“Hey!” He snaked out and ran down 
the hall toward Fox’s body. Matt 
was on his he^. 

“It’s a guard,” he called back. 
"Check the ident.” 

Watts began going through Fox’s 
pockets. He looked up once as Matt 
sidled past him, then continued with 
his work. 

44Tt’s Elaine Mattson,” said Jesus 
A Pietro. “Has to be. You’re sure 
she was alone?” 

“If there’d been anyone with her, 
he would have been in the same con- 
dition. 1 think she was alone, sir.” 
That made sense. Which was hard- 
ly a guarantee, Jesus Pietro thought. 
“Thank you, Major Jansen. How are 
the hunting squads doing?” 

“They’ve found nothing, sir. 
They’re still quartering Alpha Pla- 
teau. Shall I see how far they’ve got- 
ten?” 

“Yes. Call me back.” He hung up 
and tilted back his desk chair with a 
frown wrinkling his forehead. 

They had to be somewhere on 



Alpha. And they couldn’t all be at- 
tacking the Hospital. 

Elaine Mattson, captured. Well and 
good. She must have set off that 
mysterious explosion to cover her 
entrance. Had she also worn that 
Implementation uniform? It might be. 
She’d pass at a distance, long enough 
to knock out a crew woman and get 
a better disguise. 

Maybe. Maybe. 

He picked up the sixth dossier, the 
one lying alone next to the stunner. 
Polly Tournquist’s life; 

Born twenty-two years ago, first- 
born in a family with no known con- 
nection to the Sons of Earth. Her 
father* s left eye had come from the 
organ banks, after he*d lost his own 
to a fishing fly, A good, loyal colon- 
ist,, A disciplinarian in his own fami- 
ly- 

Raised on Delta, sector four. Stud- 
ied at Colony University, with good 
grades. She*d met Jayhawk Hood 
there. Her first love affair. Why? 
Hood would have made a bad gigolo 
. small, puny, not good looking 
... but some girls like a man with 
a mind. 

Finished high school and college, 
went to work at Delta Retransmitting 
Station. Affair with Hood had cooled 
to friendship, apparently. But she’d 
joined the Sons of Earth. Revolting 
against authority? Her father would 
have turned her in, had he known. 
Look at the lines of disapproval in 
that ferret face . hmm? Without 
those lines, he*d look something like 
Jayhawk Hood! 

It all helped. By now she’d been in 
the coffin cure for thirty hours. If a 
voice came to her now, the only 



118 



IF 




sensory stimulus in her cosmos, she’d 
listen. And believe. As others had. 
Especially if the voice appealed to 
the right incidents in her past. 

But for now she’d have to wait. 
The Sons of Earth came first. One 
down, four to go ... Jesus Pietro 
reached for his cup and found the 
coffee stone cold. 

A question touched his mind. He 
grimaced, pushed it back to wher- 
ever it had come from. He opened 
his desk phone and said, “Miss Laues- 
sen, will you order me more coffee?” 

“Are you sure? You’ll be awash 
with the stuff.” 

“Just get it. And — ” the same 
thought crawled out into the light, 
and before he could stop himself — 
“get me Matthew Keller’s file. Not 
the one on my desk, the one in the 
dead file.” 

S he came in a minute later, slender 
and blonde and looking coolly re- 
mote, carrying a folder and a pot of 
coffee. He opened the folder at once. 
She frowned at him, started to ask 
something, saw that he wasn’t listen- 
ing and left. 

Matthew Keller. Born . edu- 
cated . joined Sons of Earth 
tenth-month, 2384, in middle age. 
Why so late? Why at all? Became a 
professional killer and thief, stealing 
for the Sons of Earth, killing Imple- 
mentation officers foolish enough to 
venture into the colonist regions in 
insufficient numbers. Thief? Damn! 
Could Keller senior have stolen that 
car? The car Keller junior rode 
straight down into the void! Trapped 
in sector 28, Beta, fourth-month 
2397, captured, convicted of treason, 



disassembled for the organ banks. 
O Jesus Pietro, you clever liar you. 
Half the Hospital must know he real- 
ly went off the edge, forty miles ifpwn 
to Mist Demons and hellfire. 

So? Jesus Pietro dumped his cold 
coffee into a waste basket, poured 
a fresh cup and sipped. 

A flicking shadow somewhere at 
the corner of his eye. A noise. Some- 
one was in the room. The cup jumped 
in his hand, searing his lip. He put it 
down fast and looked around .... 

He went back to the dossier. 

Matthew Keller. What idiot whim 
had made him ask for this? Keller 
senior was dead. Crippled, crawling, 
he’d gone off the void edge split 
seconds before. 

“Castro.” 

Jesus Pietro looked up with a start. 

He looked down. Treatment re- 
ports .... Not good, but no disaster. 
Too many people had been injured 
in the mass escape, but some could 
be saved. Luckily the organ banks 
were full. And could be filled again, 
from the vivarium, once the surgery 
section found time. Why did every- 
thing have to happen at once? 

“Castro!” 

Jesus Pietro’s chin jerked up . 
and he caught himself before his eyes 
followed. He’d done this once be- 
fore, hadn’t he? There’d been a noise 
. and someone had called his name 
. and what the Mist Demons was 
someone doing unannounced in Jesus 
Pietro’s private office? He let his eyes 
travel to the edge of the desk • • • • 

Crew clothing. 

But it was rumpled and dirty, and 
it didn’t fit, and the hands which 
rested flat on his desk had dirty short 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



119 




fittgernails. A colonist in crew cloth- 
iag, for sure. In Jesus Pietro’s o^ce. 
Unannounced. He’d gone past Miss 
Lftuessen, unannounced. 

“You.” 

“That’S Where is she?” 

“You’re Matdlcw Kdler.” 

“Yes.” 

“How did you get in here?” some- 
how he kept the tremor out of his 
voice and was proud of it. 

“None of your business. Where is 
she?” 

“Who?” 

“Don’t give me that. Where’s 
Pc^y?” 

“1 can’t teU you that. Or anything 
eke,” said fesus Pietro. He kept his 
eyes fixed on the man’s stol^ ^Id 
bdt buckle. 

A t the peripheqr of his vision he 
saw two big, none too dean 
hands reach down to his own right 
haicd. His vishor leaned heavily on 
tlnrt hand, and when Jesus Pietro be- 
latedly tried to withdraw it he 
coukln’t. He saw his visitor take hold 
of Ms mid(he finger and bend it back. 

The pain was shocking. Jesus Pie- 
tro’s mouth came wide open, and he 
looked up to plead .... 

He was leachkig for Polly Touni- 
quist*s folder when agony stnidr his 
hand. He snatched it back as if tiying 
to get it off a hot stove. Rdlex. The 
midcSe finger stuck out at right angles 
to the kmicldes. 

Mist Demons, it hurt! How the 
blazes had he — 

“Well, Castro?” 

He remembered enou^, bmely 
enough, not to look isp. Someone or 
something was in this room, some- 



thing or someone with the power to 
make people forget. He made a logi- 
cal connection and said, “You.” 
“Right. Where’s Polly Tourn- 
quist?” 

“You. Matthew Keller. So you 
came for me.” 

“Let’s not play games. Where’s 
Polly?” 

“Were you in the car that attacked 
the Hospital? The one that dpve 
straight down — ” 

“Yes.” 

“Then how — ” 

“Shut up, Castro. Tdl me where 
Polly is. Now. Is she alive?” 

“You’ll get no information from 
me. How did you get back from the 
void?” 

“I flew back.” 

“I mean the first time.” 

“Castro, I could break every finger 
in both your hands. Now where’s 
Polly? Is she dead?” 

“Would i talk if you did?” 

There was hesitation. Then two 
anns converged on bis ri^t hand. 
Jesus Pietro yelped with the pain and 
reached with clawed fingers for a 
pair of eyes .... 

He was halfway through a stack 
of reports when agony bit into his 
hand. He found two fingers of his 
right hand bent back at right angles 
to the palm. With his teetii denched 
hard on a scream, Jesus Pietro turned 
on the intCTCom. “Get me the doc- 
tor.” 

“Whaf^ wrong?” 

“Just get me the — ” His eyes 
caught a flash of movement. Some- 
one in the office with him! 

“YouYe right,” said a vofce. “I 
can’t torture anything out of you.”

Faint, fading memories told him 
not to look up. He said, “You.” 

“Go fly a bicycle.” 

“Matthew Keller?” 

Silence. 

“Answer me, damn youl How did 
you get back?” 

Two hands slapped together on 
Jesus Pietro’s right hand. His whole 
face clamped down on the scream, 
and Jesus Pietro snatched up his stun- 
ner and looked wildly for a target. 

H e looked up again when the doc- 
tor entered. 

“No point in replacing them,” said 
the doctor. “They’re only dislocated.” 
And he deadened Jesus Pietro’s arm, 
set the fingers and splintered them. 
“How the Mist Demons did you do 
it?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“You don’t know? You dislocated 
two fingers and you can’t quite re- 
call — ” 

“Get off my back. I said I can’t 
remember what happened to my 
hand. But I think that infernal ghost, 
Matthew Keller, must have had 
something to do with it.” 

The doctor gave him a very pe- 
culiar look. And left. 

Jesus Pietro looked ruefjjlly at his 
right arm, splinted and dangling from 
a sling. Ohy fine. And he genuinely 
couldn’t remember anything about it. 

Which was why he kept thinking 
about Matthew Keller. 

But why did he keep thinking 
about Polly Toumquist? 

It was time and past time for the 
next phase of her treatment. But 
surely she could wait? Of course she 
could. 



He tried his coffee. Too cool. He 
poured it back into the pot and start- 
ed fresh. 

His arm felt like dead meat. 

Why did he keep thinking about 
about Polly Tournquist? 

“Phut!” He stood up clumsily, be- 
cause of his bound arm. “Miss Laues- 
sen,” he told the intercom, “get me 
two guards. I’m going over to the 
Planck:* 

“Will do.” 

He was reaching for the stunner 
on his desk when something caught 
his eye. It was the dossier for Mat- 
thew Keller, senior. A crude drawing 
defaced its yellow cover. 

Two open arcs, joined, in black 
ink. Three small closed loops beneath. 

The bleeding heart. It certainly 
hadn’t been there before. 

Jesus Pietro opened the folder. He 
could smell his own fear, and feel it, 
in the cool perspiration that soaked 
his shirt. As if he’d been afraid for 
hours. 

Front and side views. Blue eyes, 
yellow hair, skin beginning to puff 
out with age .... 

Something stirred somewhere in 
Jesus Pietro’s mind. For just a mo- 
ment the face in the folder became 
younger. Its expression changed 
slightly, so that it seemed both fright- 
ened and angry. There was blood 
soaking into its collar, and a piece 
freshly bitten from its ear. 

“Your guards have just arrived, 
sir.” 

. “Thank you,” said Jesus Pietro. He 
took one last look at the dead man 
and closed the folder. He put the 
stunner in his pocket before leaving 
his office.

44 T wish we could warn Laney,” 

-I- said Harry Kane. ‘‘This changes 
eveiything.** 

“You wouldn't even know what 
to tell hea: yet. Here, take this out” 
Mrs. Hancock put a steaming pitcher 
of hot cider on a tray, added four 
mugs. 

They were in the kitchen. Hood 
was in the living room, with Millard 
Parlette. Parlette, leaning on Jay 
Hood, had managed to stagger into 
die living room and into an armchair. 

It had seemed a good time to call 
a break. 

The wind screamed against black 
windows. To four conspirators in 
front of a convincing fire, drinking 
hot spiced cider against the vicarious 
t»ld, the living room seemed a haven. 

A temporary haven. 

“You’ve been thinking about this 
longer than we have,” said Harry. 
“We never dreamed the crew might 
compromise. Just what are you pre- 
pared to offer?” 

“To start with, amnesty for the 
Sons of Earth, for you and whoever 
remains in the vivarium. Tliat comes 
free. We’ll need you. Once the colon- 
ists lose faith in the crew, you’ll be 
the only force for law and order in 
the colony regions.” 

“That’ll be a switch.” 

“We need to discuss three types of 
medical care,” said MUlard Parlette. 
“Organic transplants, the ramrobot 
gifts and minor medical treatment. 
You already have some access to 
standard drugs, at the medcheck sta- 
tions. We can expand those. I’m sure 
we can offer free access to the heart- 

122 



beasts and liverbeasts and so forth. 
For awhile your colonists will have 
to come up to the Hospital to get 
treatment with the ramrobot sym- 
biots, but eventually we can build 
culture tanks in Gamma and Delta 
and Eta.” 

“Very good. What about the organ 
banks?” 

“Right.” Millard Parlette wrapped 
his arms around his narrow ribcage 
and stared into the fire, “I couldn’t 
plan for that part, because I didn’t 
know just what technological change 
was coming. What are your ideas?” 

“Abolish the organ banks,” Mrs. 
Hancock said firmly. 

“Throw away tons of organic 
transplant material? Dump it on the 
grass?” 

“Yes!” 

“Would you also abolish crime? 
The organ banks are our only way 
to punish thieves and murderers. 
There are no prisons on Mount Look- 
itthat.” 

“Then build prisons! You’ve been 
killing us long enough!” 

Parlette shook his head. 

Harry Kane intervened. “It 
wouldn’t work. Look, Lydia, I know 
how you feel, but we couldn’t do it. 
If we dumped all that transplant 
material out we’d have the whole 
Plateau against us. We can’t even 
abolish execution by the organ banks, 
partly because crime would run ram- 
pant without capital punishment, and 
partly because there are too many 
crew like Parlette, who need the 
banks to live. If we did that we might 
as well declare war here and now.” 

Lydia turned appealingly to Hood. 

“I pass,” said Hood. “I think you’re 

IF 




aS ignodag sometisiiig important.” 
Harry said, “Ohr 
‘Tm not sure yet. I’ll have to wait 
and see. Keep talking.” 

C4T don’t understand,” said Lydia. 

A “I don’t understand any of you. 
Wiat have we been fighting for? 
What have we been d3ring for? To 
smash the organ banks!” 

“You’re overlooking something, 
Mrs. Hancock,” Parlette said gently. 
“It isn’t that the crew wouldn^t agree 
to that, and it isn’t that the colonists 
wouldn’t agree to that. They wouldn’t, 
of course. But 7 won’t let you kick 
in the organ banks.” 

“No.” Lydia’s words dripped 
scorn. “You’d have to die then, 
wouldn’t you?” 

“Yes, I would. And you need me.” 
“Why? What have you got for us 
besides your influence and your good 
advice?” 

“A small army. I have more than 
one hundred lineal descendants. 
They’ve been prepared for this day 
for a very long time. Not all of them 
will follow me, but most will obey 
my orders without question. They all 
have hunting weapons.” 

Lydia sighed, raggedly. 

“We’ll do our best, Mrs. Hancock. 
We can’t eliminate the organ banks, 
but we can eliminate the injustice.” 
“What we’ll have to do,” said Har- 
ry, “is establish a first come, first 
serve basis for what’s already in the 
banks. Whoever gets sick fiKt . 
you see what I mean. Meanwhile we 
set up a new code of law, so that a 
crew stands just as mudi chance of 
getting into fte banks as a colonist.” 
“Don’t push too hard there, Kane. 



Remember, we have to satisfy both 
groups.” 

“PhutI” said Lydia Hancock. It 
was hard to tell whether she Was 
ready to cry or to start a fistfight. 

They were a circle of three, lean- 
ing toward each other across the cof- 
fee table, holding forgotten mugs. 
Hood sat a little back from the coffee 
table, ignored, waiting for something. 

“The thing is,” said Parlette, “we 
can make everyone equal before the 
law. We can ^ that and get away 
with it, provided that there is no re- 
distribution of property. Do you agree 
to that?” 

“Not completely.” 

“Look at the logic. Everyone is 
equal in the courts. A crime is a 
crime. But the more property a man 
has, the less likely he is to want to 
commit a crime. It gives the crew 
something to protect, and it gives the 
colonist something to gain.” 

“It makes sense, yes. But there are 
a few things we’ll want.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“Our own electrical power sour- 
ces.” 

“Fine. We’ll supply it free until we 
can build plants on Gamma and Del- 
ta. We can put hydraulic plants along 
the Muddy and Long Fall Rivers.” 
“Good. We want free access to 
the organ banks, guaranteed.” 
“That’s a problem. An organ bank 
is like any other bank. You can’t 
take out more than you put in. We’ll 
have less condemned criminals and 
a lot more sick colonists to take care 
of.” 

H ood had his chair tilted back on 
two legs, with his feet on the

edge of the table. His eyes were half 
closed, as if he were dreaming pleas- 
ant daydreams. 

“Lotteries, then, fair lotteries. And 
And heavy research into alloplasty, 
financed by the crew.” 

“Why the crew?” 

“You’ve got all the money.” 

“We can work out a graduated tax. 
Anything else?” 

“There are a lot of unjust laws. 
We’ll want to build houses as we see 
fit. No restrictions on the clothes we 
wear. Free travel. The right to buy 
machinery, any machinery, at the 
same price a crew pays. We’ll want 
to put some solid restrictions on Im- 
plementation — ” 

“Why? They’ll be police. They’ll 
be enforcing your laws.” 

“Parlette, have you ever had a 
squad of police come crashing 



through the wall of your house, 
throwing merey-bullets and sleepy 
gas around, dragging housecleaners 
into the light, tearing up the indoor 
lawn — ” 

“I’ve never been a rebel.” 

“The hell you say.” 

Parlette smiled. It made him look 
too much like a death’s head. “I’ve 
never been caught.” 

“Point is. Implementation can do 
that to anyone. And does, constantly. 
The householder doesn’t even get an 
apology when they don’t find evi- 
dence of crime.” 

“I hate to restrict the police. It’s 
a sure route to chaos. Parlette took 
a long swallow of cider. “All right, 
how does this sound? There used to 
be a thing called a search warrant. 
It kept the UN police from entering 
any home unless they had a good and 




sufficient reason, one they could show 
to a judge.” 

“Sounds good.” 

can look up the details in the 
library.” 

“Another thing. As things stand 
now, Implementation has an exclus- 
ive monopoly on prisoners. They 
catch ’em, decide whether they’re 
guilty and take ’em apart We ought 
to split those functions up somehow.” 
“I’ve thought about that Kane. We 
can establish laws such that no man 
can be executed until he has been de- 
clared guilty by a clear majority of 
ten men. Five crew, five colonists, 
in cases where crew and colonists are 
both involved. Otherwise, trial by 
five of the prisoner’s own social 
group. All trials to be public, on some 
special teedee channel.” 

“That sounds — ” 

“I knew it.” Jay Hood dropped 
back into the discussion with a thump 
of chair legs on flooring. “Do you 
realize that every suggestion either 
of you has made tonight would take 
power away from the Hospital?” 
Parlette frowned. “Perhaps. What 
does it matter?” 

“You’ve been talking as if there 
were two power groups on Mount 
Lookitthat, There are threel You, us 
and the Hospital, and the Hospital 
is the most powerful. Parlette, you’ve 
been studying the Sons of Earth for 
Mist Demons know how long. Have 
you spent any time studying Jesus 
Pietro Castro?” 

“I’ve known him a long time.” 
Millard Parlette considered. “At least, 
I know he’s competent. I don’t sup- 
pose I really know how he thinks.” 
“Harry does. Harry, what would 



Castro do if we tried to put all these 
restrictions on his police?” 

iiT don’t understand you,” said 

A Millard Parlette. “Castro is a 
good, loyal man. He has never done 
anything that wasn’t in the best in- 
terests of the crew. Perhaps I don’t 
know him socially, but I do know 
that he regards himself as a servant 
of the crew. Anything the crew ac- 
cepts, he will accept.” 

“Damnit, Hood’s right,” said Har- 
ry Kane. “I know Castro better than 
I knew my father. I just hadn’t 
thought of this.” 

“Jesus Pietro Castro is a good, 
loyal — ” 

— Servant of the crew. Right. 
Now hold on just a minute, Parlette. 
Let me speak.” 

“First of all, what crew? What 
crew is he loyal to?” 

Parlette snorted. He picked up his 
mug and found it empty. 

“He’s not . loyal to any specific 
crew,” said Harry Kane. “In fact he 
doesn’t respect most crew. He re- 
spects you, and there are others who 
fit his ideals, but what he’s loyal to 
is a sort of ideal crew: a man who 
does not overspend, is polite to his 
inferiors and knows exactly how to 
treat them and has the best interests 
of the colonists in his mind at all 
times. This image is the man he 
serves. 

“Now, let’s Idbk for a moment at 
what we propose to do. Search war- 
rants for the Implementation police. 
We remove Implementation’s power 
to choose what colonists get the left- 
over materials from the organ banks. 
We tell them who they may and may

not execute. Anything else, Jay?” 
“Power. We’re taking the electrical 
monopoly away from the Hospital. 
Oh, and with less restrictions on the 
colonists, the police would have less 
work to do. Castro would have to 
fire some of ’em.” 

“Right. Now, you don’t suppose 
every crew on the Plateau is going to 
agree with all of that, do you?” 

“No, not all. Of course not. We 
may be able to swing a majority. At 
least a majority of political power.” 
“Damn your majority. What crew 
is Castro going to be loyal to? You 
can name him.” 

Parlette was rubbing the back of 
his neck. “I see your point, of course. 
Given that you’ve analyzed Castro 
correctly, he’ll follow the conserva- 
tive faction.” 

“He will, believe me. The crew 
who would rather die than accept our 
compromise is the man he’ll follow. 
And all of Implementation will follow 
him. He’s their leader.” 

“And they’ve got all the weapons,” 
said Hood. 

B leeding heart. Matthew Keller. 
Polly Tournquist. 

Why Polly Tournquist? 

She could have nothing to do with 
the present trouble. Since Saturday 
evening she had been suffering sen- 
sory deprivation in the coffin cure. 
Why must he be haunted by the col- 
onist girl? What was her hold on him, 
that she could pull him away from 
his office at a time like this? He 
hadn’t felt a fascination like this 
since — 

He couldn’t remember, at least not 
very well. 



The guard in front of him stopped 
suddenly, pushed a button in the wall 
and stepped aside. Jesus Pietro jerked 
back to reality. They had reached the 
elevator. 

The doors slid back, and Jesus 
Pietro stepped in, followed by the 
two guards. 

{Where* s Polly? Deep in his mind 
something whispered. Where is she? 
Subliminally, he remembered. Tell 
me where Polly is!) 

Bleeding heart. Matthew Keller. 
Polly Tournquist. 

Either he’d finally lost his mind — 
and over a colonist girl! — or there 
was some connection between Mat- 
thew Keller and Polly Tournquist. 
But he had no evidence of that at all. 

Perhaps the girl would be able to 
tell him. 

And if she could, certainly she 
would. 

M att had trailed them to the end 
of a blind corridor. When they 
stopped. Matt stopped too, confused. 
Was Castro going to Polly, or wasn’t 
he? 

Doors slid back in the wall, and 
Matt’s three guides entered. Matt 
followed, but stopped at the doors. 
The room was too small. He’d bump 
an elbow and get shot .... 

The doors closed in his face. Matt 
heard muted mechanical noises, di- 
minishing. 

What in blazes was it, an airlock? 
And why here? 

He was at the end of a dead-end 
corridor, lost in the Hospital. The 
Head and two guards were on the 
other side of those doors. Two guards, 
armed and alert . but they were 

IF 



126 




the only guides he had. Matt pushed 
the big black button which had 
opened the doors. 

This time they stayed closed. 

He pushed it again. Nothing hap- 
pened. 

Was he doing exactly what the 
guard had done? Had the guard used 
a whistle, or a key? 

Matt looked down the hall to 
where it bent, wondering if he could 
make his way back to Castro’s office. 
Probably not. He pushed the button 
again .... 

A muted mechanical noise, nearly 
inaudible, but rising. 

Presently the doors opened to show 
a tiny, boxlike room, empty. 

He stepped in, crouched slightly, 
ready for anything. There were no 
doors in the back. How had the 
others left? Nothing. Nothing but 
four buttons labeled 1, 2, DOOR 
OPEN, EMERGENCY STOP. 

He pushed them in order. 1 did 
nothing. He pushed 2, and ever 5 rthing 
happened at once. 

T^e doors closed. 

The room started to move. He felt 
it, vibration and uncanny pressure 
against the soles of his feet. He drop- 
ped to his hands and knees, choking 
off a yell. 

The pressure was gone, but still 
the room quivered with motion, and 
still there was the frightening, un- 
familiar sound of machinery. Matt 
waited, crouching on all fours. 

There was a sudden, foreign feel- 
ing in his belly and gonads, a feel of 
falling. Matt said, “Wumpl” and 
clutched at himself. The box jarred to 
a stop. 

The doors opened. He came out. 



He was on a high, narrow bridge. 
The moving box was at one end, 
supported in four vertical girders 
which dropped straight down into a 
square hole in the roof of the Hos- 
pital. At the other end of the bridge 
was a similar set of girders, empty. 

M att had never been this high 
outside a car. All of the Hos- 
pital was below him, lit by glare 
lights: the sprawling amorphous 

structure of rooms and corridors, the 
inner grounds, the slanting wall, the 
defense perimeter, the trapped forest 
and the access road. And rising up 
before him was the vast black hull 
of the Planck. 

Matt’s end of the bridge was just 
outside what was obviously the outer 
hull of the ancient slowboat. The 
bridge crossed the chisel-sharp ring 
of the leading edge, so that its other 
end was over the Attic. 

The Planck. Matt looked down 
along the smooth black metal flank 
of the outer hull. For most of its 
length the ship was cylindrical; but 
the tail, the trailing edge, flared out- 
ward for a little distance, and the 
leading edge was beveled like a chisel, 
curving In at a thirty degree angle to 
close the twenty-foot gap between 
outer and inner hulls, the gap that 
held the guts of the ship. More than 
halfway down, just below a ring of 
narrow \\dndows, the roof of the 
Hospital moved in to grip the hull. 
Something hummed behind him. 
The moving box was on its way 
down. 

Matt watched it go, and then he 
started across the bridge, sliding his 
hands along the hip-high handrails. 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



127 




The dropping of the box might mean 
that someone would be coming up. 

At the other end he looked for a 
black button in one of the four sup- 
porting girders. It was there, and he 
pushed it. Then he looked down. 

The Attic, the space enclosed by 
the inner hull, was as perfectly cylin- 
drical as a soup can with both ends 
removed. Four airfoils formed a cross 
at the stem, a few yards above the 
ground, and where they crossed was 
a bulky, pointed casing. There was 
a ring of four windows halfway down 
the inner hull. The airlock was at 
the same level. Matt could see it by 
looking between the hull and the 
moving box, which was rising toward 
him. 

Matt felt a chill as he looked 
down at that pointed casing between 
the fins. The ship’s center of mass 
was directly over it. Therefore it had 
to be the fusion drive. 

The Planck was rumored to be a 
dangerous place, and not without 
reason. A ship that had carried men 
between the stars, a ship three hun- 
dred years old, was bound to inspire 
awe. But there was real power here. 
The Planck*s landing motors should 
still be strong enough to hurl her 
into the sky. Her fusion drive sup- 
plied electrical power to all the col- 
onist regions: to teedee stations, 
homes, smokeless factories . and 
if that fusion plant ever blew, it 
would blow Alpha Plateau into the 
void. 

Somewhere in the lifesystem, sand- 
wiched between inner and outer hull, 
were the controls that could blow the 
bomb in that casing. The Head was 
in there too . somewhere. 



If Matt could bring them togeth- 
er ... 

The moving box reached the top, 
and Matt entered. 

It dropped a long way. The Planck 
was tall. Even the beveled ring of 
the leading edge, which had held 
stored equipment for the founding of 
a colony, was forty feet high. The 
ship was one hundred and eighty feet 
high, including a landing skirt; for 
the inner hull did not quite reach the 
ground. The stem, and the mouths of 
the landing motors, were supported 
ten feet above the ground by that 
flaring, skirtlike extension of the out- 
er hull. 

This moving box was an open 
grid. Matt could watch his progress 
all the way down. Had he been acro- 
phobic, he’d have been insane be- 
fore the box stopped opposite the 
airlock. 

T he airlock was not much bigger 
than the moving box. Inside, it 
was all dark metal, with a dial-and- 
control panel in chipped blue plastic. 
Already Matt was heartily sick of 
blinking dials and metal walls. It 
was strange and discomforting to be 
surrounded by so much metal, and 
unnerving to wonder what all those 
dials were trying to tell him. 

Set in the ceiling was something 
Matt had trouble recognizing. Some- 
thing simple, almost familiar . 
ah. A ladder. A ladder, running use- 
lessly from door to wall across the 
ceiling of the airlock. 

Sure. With the ship spinning in 
space, the outer door would be a trap 
door down from the Attic. Of course 
you’d need a ladder. Matt grinned 

IP 



128 




and strode through the airlpck and 
nearly ran face on into a policeman. 

**1116 luck of Matt Keller*’ had no 
time to work. Matt dodged back into 
the airlock. He heaid a patter of 
mercy-bullets, like gravel on metal. 
In a moment the man would be 
around the comer, firing. 

Matt yelled the only thing he could 
think of. “StopI It’s mer 

The guard was around in the same 
instant. But he didn’t fire yet . 
and he didn’t fire yet . • . and pres- 
ently he turned and went, muttering 
a surly apology. Matt wondered who 
he’d been taken for. It wouldn’t mat- 
ter, the man had already forgotten 
him. 

Matt chose to follow him, instead 
of turning the other way. It seemed 
to him that if a guard saw two men 
approach, and ignored one, and rec- 
ognized the other ... he wouldn’t 
shoot, no matter how trigger-happy 
he was. 

The corridor was narrow, and it 
curved to the left Floor and ceiling 
were green. The left-hand wall was 
white, set with uncomfortably bright 
lights, and the wall on the ri^t was 
black, with a roughened, rubbery 
surface, obviously designed as a floor. 
Worse yet, the doors were all trap- 
doors, leading down into the floor 
and up into the ceiling. Most of the 
doors were open, and ladders led up 
into these. All the ladders and walk- 
ways looked old and crude, colony- 
built and all were riveted into place. 

It was eerie. Everything was on its 
side. Walking through this place was 
like defying gravity. 

Matt heard sounds and voices &om 
some of the rooms above. They told 



him nothing. He couldn’t see what 
was happening above him, and he 
didn’t try. He was listening for Cas- 
tro’s voice. 

If he could get the Head to the 
fusion-drive controk . where ever 
they were • . then he could threaten 
to blow up the Planck. Castro had 
held out under the threat of physical 
pain. But how would he react to a 
threat to Alpha Plateau? 

And all Matt wanted was to free 
one prisoner. 

. That was Castro’s voice. 

Coming not from the ceiling but 
from underfoot, from a closed door. 
Matt bent over the walkway across 
it, and tried the handle. Locked. 

Knock? But all of Implementation 
was on edge tonight, ready to shoot 
at anything. Under such circum- 
stances Matt could be unconscious 
and falling long seconds before a 
gunman could lose interest in him. 

No way to steal a key, to identify 
the right key. And he couldn’t stay 
here forever. 

If only Laney were here now ....

voice. Polly jerked to attention 
. except that she felt no jerk. 
She did not know if she had moved 
or not. 

A voice. For some timeless interval 
she had existed with no sensation at 
all. There were pictures in her mem- 
ory, and games she could play in her 
mind, and for a time there had been 
sleep. Some friend had shot her full 
of mercy-bullets. She remembered 
the sting, vividly. But she’d wakened. 
Mental games had failed; she couldn’t

concentrate. She had begun to doubt 
the reality of her memories. Friends* 
faces were blurred. She had clung to 
the memory of Jay Hood, his sharp- 
edged, scholarly face, easy to remem- 
ber. Jay. For two years they had 
been little more than close friends. 
But in recent hours she had loved 
him hopelessly: his was the only vis- 
ual image that would come clear to 
her, except for a hated face, wide 
and expressionless, decorated with a 
bright snowy mustache: the face of 
the enemy. But she was trying to 
make Jay come too clear, to give him 
texture, expression, meaning. He had 
blurred; she had reached to bring 
him back; he had blurred more . 

A voice. It had her complete at- 
tention. 

“Polly,” it said, “you must trust 
me.” 

She wanted to answer, to express 
her gratitude, to tell the voice to keep 
talking, to beg it to let her out. She 
was voiceless. 

“I would like to free you, to bring 
you back to the world of sense and 
touch and smell,” said the voice. 
Gently, sympathetically, regretfully, it 
added, “I cannot do that just yet. 
There are people making me keep 
you here.” 

A voice had become the voice, 
familiar, wholly reassuring. Suddenly 
she placed it. 

“Harry Kane and Jayhawk Hood. 
They won’t let me free you.” 

Castro’s voice! She wanted to 
scream. 

“. Because you failed in your 
mission. You were to find out about 
ramrobot number one forty-three. 
You failed.** 



Liar! Liar! I didn't fail! She wanted 
to scream out the truth, all of the 
truth. At the same time she knew 
that that was Castro’s aim. But she 
hadn’t talked in so long! 

“Are you trying to tell me some- 
thing? Perhaps I can persuade Harry 
and Jayhawk to let me free your 
mouth. Would you like that?” 

Vd love that, Polly thought. Vd tell 
all the secrets of your ancestry. Some- 
thing within her was still rational. The 
sleep, that was what had done it. 
How long had she been here? Not 
years; not even days; she would have 
been thirsty. Unless they’d given her 
water intravenously .... But how- 
ever long it had been, she’d slept for 
some part of the time. Castro didn’t 
know about the mercy-bullets. He’d 
come hours early. 

Where was the voice? 

All was silent. Faintly she co^uld 
hear her pulse beating in her carotid 
arteries; but as she grasped for the 
sound, it too was gone. 

Where was Castro? Leaving her to 
rot? 

Speak! 

Speak to me! 

T he Planck was big, but its life- 
system occupied less than a third 
of its volume: three rings of pres- 
surized compartments between the 
cargo holds above and the water fuel 
tanks and fission-driven landing mo- 
tors below. Much cargo had been 
needed to set up a self-sufficient col- 
ony. Much fuel had been needed to 
land the Planck. Trying to land on 
the controlled hydrogen bomb of the 
fusion drive would have been like 
landing a blowtorch on a featherbed. 

IF 



130 




So the lifesystem was not large. 
But neither was it cramped, since the 
compartments aft of the corridor had 
been designed for the comfort of just 
three growing families. 

That which was now Jesus Castro’s 
interrogation room had once been a 
living room, with sofas, a card table, 
a coffee table, a reader screen con- 
nected to the ship’s library, a small 
refrigerator. The tables and other 
things were gone now, cut from the 
outer wall with torches, long ago. It 
had been a big room, luxuriously so 
for a spacecraft, where room is al- 
ways at a premium. It had had to be 
big. Any normal apartment dweller 
can step outside for a breath of air. 

Now, upended, the room was 
merely tall. Halfway up the walls 
were the doors which had led to 
other parts of the apartment. The 
door to th6 corridor had become a 
trap door, and the door just under it, 
a closet to hold spacesuits in case of 
emergency, could now be reached 
only from the ladder. In the crescent 
of floor space at the bottom of the 
room were a long, heavy box, two 
guards in chairs, a third empty chair, 
and Jesus Pietro Castro, closing the 
padded lip of the speaking tube at 
one corner of the box. 

“Give her ten minutes to think it 
over,” he said. He glanced at his 
watch, noted the time. 

His handphone buzzed. 

“I’m in the vivarium,” Major Jan- 
sen reported. “The girl’s a colonist, 
all right, in stolen clothing. We don’t 
know where she got it yet. I doubt 
we’U like the answer. We had to 
pump antidotes into her; she was dy- 
ing — overdose of mercy-weapons.” 



“No sign that anyone came with 
her?” 

“I didn’t say that, sir. There are 
two things. One, the wires were 
pulled on the chair she was sitting 
in. Her helmet was stone dead. She 
couldn’t have done that herself. May- 
be that’s why one of the prisoners 
woke up this afternoon.” 

“And then he freed the others? I 
don’t believe it. We would have no- 
ticed the pulled wires afterward.” 

“I agree, sir. So somebody pulled 
the wires after she was in the chair.” 

“Maybe. What’s your second 
point?” 

“When the gas went off in the vi- 
varium, one of the four police wasn’t 
wearing his nose plug. We haven’t 
been able to find it anywhere. His 
locker’s empty, and when I called his 
wife she said he took it with him. 
He’s awake now, but he has no 
idea — ” 

“Is it worth bothering with? The 
guards aren’t used to gas filters. Or 
gas.” 

“There was a mark on the man’s 
forehead, sir. Like the one we found 
this afternoon, only this one is in 
ballpoint ink.” 

“Oh.” 

“Which means that there must be 
a traitor in Implementation itself, 
sir.” 

C4TX7hat makes you think so, 
VV Major?” 

“The bleeding-heart symbol does 
not represent any known revolution- 
ary organization. Further, only a 
guard could have made that mark. 
Nobody else has entered the vivarium 
tonight.”

Jesus Pietro swallowed his im- 
patience. “You may be right, Major. 
Tomorrow we’ll devise ways to smoke 
them out.” 

Major Jansen made several sug- 
gestions. Jesus Pietro listened, made 
appropriate comments, and cut him 
off as soon as he could. 

A traitor in Implementation? Jesus 
Pietro hated to think so. It was pos- 
sible, and not a thing to be ignored; 
but the knowledge that the Head sus- 
pected such a thing could damage 
Implementation morale more than 
any possible traitor. 

In any case, Jesus Pietro was not 
interested. No traitorous guard could 
have moved invisibly in Jesus Pietro’s 
office. The bleeding heart was some- 
thing else entirely. 

Jesus Pietro called the power room. 
“You aren’t doing anything right 
now, are you? Good. Would one of 
you bring us some coffee?” 

Three minutes more, and he could 
resume interrogation. 

Jesus Pietro paced. He walked off 
balance, with one arm bound im- 
mobile against his body: one more 
annoyance. The numbness was wear- 
ing off in his mangled hand. 

Yes, the bleeding heart was some- 
thing else again. A gruesome symbol 
on a vivarium, floor. Fingers that 
broke without their owner noticing. 
An ink drawing appearing from no- 
where on a dossier cover, like a sig- 
nature. A signature. 

Intuition was tricky. Intuition had 
told Jesus Pietro that something 
would happen tonight. And some- 
thing had; but what? Intuition, or 
something like it, had brought him 
here. Surely he’d had no logical rea- 



son to keep thinking about Polly 
Tournquist. Did she really know 
something? Or did his subconscious 
mind have other motives for bring- 
ing him here? 

Jesus Pietro paced, following the 
arc of the inner wall. 

Presently someone knocked on the 
door overhead. The guards loosened 
their guns and looked up. Fumbling 
sounds, and then the door dropped 
open and a man backed slowly down 
the ladder. He balanced a tray in 
one hand. He did not try to close the 
door after him. 

The slowboat had never been a 
convenient place to work. Ladders 
everywhere. The man with the tray 
had to back a long way down, the 
full length of what had been a large, 
comfortable living room, before he 
touched bottom .... ' 

Matt poked his head through the 
doorway, upside down. 

There was the lab man, backing 
down the ladder with his coffee tray 
balanced on one hand. On the floor 
were three more men, and one was 
Castro. As Matt’s head appeared in 
the doorway each pair of eyes glanc- 
ed up, held Matt’s stare for a mo- 
ment, then dropped. 

Matt started down, looking over 
his shoulder, trying to hold eight 
eyes at once.

“Help me over to the phone.” 

“We’d be committing suicide,” said

of relatives do when they learned 
we were holding you prisoner in your 
own house?” 

“I’m here of my own free will. 
You know that.” 

“But will they know that?” 

“My family will stand behind me.” 
Parlette set the palms of his hands 
on the chair arms and, with tremen- 
dous effort, stood up. But, once up, 
he was unable to move. 

“They won’t know what’s going 
on,” said Harry Kane. “All they’ll 
know for certain is that you’re alone 
in the house with three escaped vi- 
varium prisoners.” 

“Kane, they wouldn’t understand 
what’s happening if I talked for two 
hours. But they’ll stand behind me” 
Harry Kane opened his mouth, 
closed it again, and began to tremble. 
He had to fold his hands on the 
table to keep them from shaking. 
“Call them,” he said. 

“No,” said Jay Hood. 

“Help him. Jay.” 

“No! If he uses that phone to 
turn us in, he’ll go down as the great-

up and wrapped one of Parlette’s

ever had. We’ve got to trust him.” 
And she walked him over to the 
phone. 

A lmost time to resume the inter- 
rogation. Jesus Pietro waited 
while the lab man deposited his tray 
on the “coffin” and started back up. 

And he realized that his pulse was 
racing. There was cold perspiration 



dribbling wetly down his ribs. His 
hand throbbed like a heart. His eyes 
flickered here, there, all about the 
room, looking for something that 
wasn’t there. 

Within seconds, and for no reason 
at all, the interrogation room had 
become a trap. 

There was a thump, and every 
muscle in his body jumped. Nothing 
there, nothing his eyes could find. 
But he, the nerveless, elephantine 
Castro, was jumping at shadows. The 
room was a trap, a trap. 

“Back in a moment,” said Jesus 
Pietro. He strode to the ladder, look- 
ing every inch the Man in Charge, 
and went up. 

A guard, “But, sir! What about 
the prisoner?” 

“I’ll be right back,” said the Head, 
without slowing. 

He pulled himself through the 
doorway, reached down and closed 
the door. And there he stuck. 

He’d had no planned destination. 
Something had screamed at him to 
get out, some intuition so powerful 
that he had followed it without ques- 
tion. Right in the middle of an in- 
terrogation. 

What was he afraid of? Was he 
about to learn some impleasant truth 
from Polly Tournquist? Or was it 
guilt? Surely he no longer lusted after 
the colonist girl. Surely he could 
control it if he did ... 

No Implementation man had ever 
seen him thus: shoulders slumped, 
face set in wrinkles of fatigue, stand- 
ing in a hallway because he had no 
place to go. 

In any case, he had to go back. 
Polly Tournquist was waiting for the

sound of his voice. She might or 
might not know things he needed to 
know. 

He pulled himself together, visibly, 
and turned to face the door, his 
eyes, sliding automatically around the 
bright frosted pane in the wall. Men 
who worked in the slowboats devel- 
oped such habits. As ceiling lights the 
panes would have been just bright 
enough. As wall lights they hurt the 
eyes. 

Castro’s eyes slid around the pane, 
caught something, and came back. 
There was a blue scrawl on the frost- 
ed pane. 

M att was almost down the ladder 
when the man in the lab coat 
started up. 

Matt addressed a subvocal com- 
ment to the Mist Demons, who made 
no obvious response. Then, because 
the lab man was about to bump into 
him, he swung around to the under- 
side of the ladder and dropped. He 
landed with a thump. Every head in 
the room jerked around. Matt back- 
ed into a corner, stepping softly. 

He’d known it from the beginning: 
he couldn’t count on this power of 
his. At some point he would have 
enough of being afraid; the glandu- 
lar caps over his kidneys would stop 
producing adrenalin .... 

The guards turned their eyes back 
to the ceiling. The lab man disap- 
peared through the doorway and 
closed the door after him. Only Cas- 
tro himself continued to behave pe- 
culiarly; his eyes kept darting around 
the room as if searching for some- 
thing that wasn’t there. Matt began 
to breathe more easily. 



The man with the coffee had ap- 
peared at just the right time. Matt 
had been about to leave, to see if he 
could find a fusion control room be- 
fore he got back to Castro. He had, 
in fact, discovered that the frosted 
glass in the hall light would take ink, 
and he was marking it to show which 
door led to Castro, when someone 
had rounded the corner, carrying cof- 
fee. 

Castro was still behaving oddly. 
During the interview in Castro’s of- 
fice, Matt had never ceased to be 
afraid of him. Yet now he seemed 
only a nervous man with a bandaged 
arm. 

Dangerous thinking, thought Matt. 
Be scared! 

Suddenly Castro started up the lad- 
der. 

Matt nibbled his lower lip. Some 
cosmic chase this was becoming! 
Where was the Head going now? And 
how could Matt hold six eyes, two 
above and four below, while climbing 
a ladder? 

He started for the ladder anyway. 

“But sir! What about the prison- 
er?” 

“I’ll be right back.” 

Matt backed into the corner again. 
Prisoner? 

Coffin. The word was nearly ob- 
solete on Mount Lookitthat, where 
crew and colonist alike used their 
dead. But that box against the wall 
was easily big enough to hold a 
prisoner. 

He’d have to look inside. 

But first, the guards. 

44 Tt’s the Head calling. Major.” 

A “Thank you. Miss Lauessen.”

“Jansen, is that you, speak up.” 
“Yes, sir.” 

“I’ve found another bleeding 
heart.” 

“M the Planckr 

“Yes. Right above the coffin room, 
on a light. Now here’s what I want 
done. I want you to close the Planck's 
airlocks, flood the ship with gas, then 
come in with a squad. Anyone you 
can’t identify immediately, play a 
sonic over him to keep him quiet. 
Got it?” 

“Yes sir. Suppose the traitor is 
someone we know?” 

“Use your own judgment there. I 
have good reason to assume he’s not 
a policeman, though he may be in 
uniform. How long will you need?” 
“About twenty minutes. I could 
use cars instead of elevators, but it 
would take just as long.” 

“Good. Use the cars. Seal off the 
elevators first. I want as much sur- 
prise effect as possible.” 

“Yes sir.” 

T he guards were no trouble at all. 

Matt stepped up behind one of 
the men, pulled the gun from his hol- 
ster and shot them both. 

He kept the gun in his hand. It 
felt good. He was sick of having to 
be afraid. It was a situation to drive 
a man right out of his skull. If he 
stopped being afraid, even for an in- 
stant, he could be killed! But now, 
at least for the moment, he could 
stop listening for footsteps, stop try- 
ing to look in all directions at once. 
A sonic stunner was a surer bet than 
a hypothetical, undependable psi 
power. It was real, cold and hard in 
his hand. 



The “coffin” was bigger than it 
had seemed from the doorway.^ He 
found clamps, big and easy to= ^oper- 
ate. The lid was heavy. Foam plastic 
covered the inside, with a sound- 
deadening surface of small interlock- 
ing conical indentations. > 

Inside was something packed very 
carefully in soft, thick white cloth. 
Its shape was only vaguely human, 
and its head was not human at all. 
Matt felt the back hairs stir on his 
neck. Coffin, And the thing inside 
didn’t move. If he had found Polly, 
then Polly was dead. 

He began unwrapping it any^^ay, 
starting with what passed for the fig- 
ure’s head. He found ear cups, and 
underneath, human ears. They were 
blood-warm to the touch. Matt be- 
gan to hope. 

He unwrapped cloth from a pair 
of brown eyes. They looked up at 
him, and then they blinked. < 
Hoping was over. He had found 
Polly, and she was alive.

S he was more cocoon than girl. 

Toward the eni she was helping 
to get the wrappings and paddings 
and sensory wires off her legs. She 
wasn’t much help. Her fingers 
wouldn’t work. Muscles jerked rhyth- 
mically in her jaw, her arms, her legs. 
When she tried to step out of the 
coffin Matt had to catch the full 
weight of her falling body, and they 
went down in a heap. 

“Thanks,” she said unsteadily. 
“Thanks for getting me out of there.” 
“That’s why I’m here.” 

“I remember you.” She got up, 

135 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 




clinging to his arm for support. She 
had not yet smiled. When Matt un- 
covered her mouth and removed the 
clamps and padding, she had looked 
like a child expecting to be slapped. 
She still did, “You’re Matt something. 
Aren’t you?’’ 

“Matt Keller. Cap you stand by 
yourself now?” 

“Where are we?” She did not let 
go of his arm. 

“In the middle of the Hospital. 
But we have a fair chance to get out, 
if you do just as I say.” 

“How did you get in?” 

“Jay Hood tells me I have a kind 
of psychic invisibility. As long as I 
can stay scared, I can keep people 
from seeing me. That’s what we have 
to count on. Hey, are you all right?” 

“Since you ask, no.” She smiled 
for the first time, a ghost grin, a rictus 
that vanished in a split second. She 
was better off without it. 

“You don’t look it. Come here, sit 
down.” She was clinging to his upper 
arm with both hands, as if afraid to 
fall. He led her to one of the chairs. 
She’s still in shock, he thought. “Bet- 
ter yet, lie down. On the floor. Easy, 
Now put your feet up on the chair. 
What the Mist Demons were they 
doing to you?” 

“It’s a long story.” Her brows 
puckered, leaving a sudden deep V 
between her eyes. “I can tell it fast, 
though. They were doing nothing to 
me. Nothing and nothing and noth- 
ing.” She lay on her back with her 
feet in the air, the way Matt had 
placed her, and her eyes looked up 
past the ceiling, looked up at Noth- 
ing- 

Matt wanted to look away. Polly 



was no longer pretty. Her hair was 
a housecleaners’ nest,. and her make- 
up had gone every which way; but 
that wasn’t it. Something had gone 
out of her, and something else had 
replaced it. Her pale face mirrored 
the ultimate horror of what she saw, 
looking up at Nothing. 

Presently she said, “How did you 
get here. Matt?” 

“Came to rescue you.” 

“You’re not a Son of Earth.” 
“No.” 

“You could be a ringer. Harry’s 
house was raided the night you 
came.” 

“That’s highly ungrateful for a 
maiden in distress.” 

“I’m sorry.” But her eyes were 
watchful and suspicious. She took her 
feet off the chair and rolled to sitting 
position on the floor. She was wear- 
ing an unfamiliar garment, like a 
playsuit, but made of soft, flimsy 
fabric. Her fingers had found a corn- 
er of the cloth and were playing with 
it, kneading it, pulling at it, rolling it, 
crumpling it. “I can’t trust anything. 
I’m not even sure I’m not dreaming. 
Maybe I’m still in the box.” 

“Easy,” he said, and squeezed her 
shoulder reassuringly. “You’ll get 
over — ” 

S he snatched at his hand to hold it 
there, so quickly that he almost 
jerked away. Every move she made 
was exaggerated. “You don’t know 
what it was like being dead!” She was 
squeezing his hand, feeling the fingers 
and the nails and the knuckles, as if 
she’d never touched a human hand 
before. “I kept trying to remember 
things, and they were always just put

of reach. It was — ” She stuck, her 
larynx bobbing and her lips twitch- 
ing without sound. Then she jumped 
at him. 

She knocked him flat on his back 
and wrapped herself around him. It 
was nothing affectionate. She clung 
to him as if she were drowning and 
he a floating log. “Hey,” said Matt. 
“The gun. You knocked the gun 
away.” 

She didn’t hear. Matt looked up 
at the door. It didn’t move, and there 
were no ominous noises. 

“It’s all right,” he said. “It’s okay 
now. You’re out.” She had her face 
buried in the hollow of his shoulder, 
and she was moving against him. Her 
arms were tight around his chest with 
a grip of desperation. “You’re out 
now.” He massaged her neck and 
shoulder muscles, trying to do what 
Laney had done night before last. 

The way she kept touching things, 
kneading them — he understood now. 
She was making sure they were real. 
The time in the “coffin” must have 
been worse than he could imagine. 
She must have lost all touch with 
reality, all her faith in the solidness 
of things outside that artificial womb. 
And so she ran her hands along his 
back, traced the lines of his shoulder- 
blades and vertabrae with her finger- 
tips; and so she moved against him 
with a sliding motion, with her toes, 
her thighs, her arms, her body, as if 
sensing, sensing with every square 
inch of skin .... 

He felt himself coming alive in 
response. Trap doors and curved metal 
walls, guns and Implementation po- 
lice, ceased to matter at all. There 
was only Polly. 



“Help me,” she said, her voice 
muffled. 

Matt rolled over onto her. The 
soft, flimsy-looking fabric of her 
jumper tore like tissue. Fleetingly^ 
Matt wondered why it was there at 
all. And that didn’t matter either. 

Presently Polly said, “Well, I’m 
real after all.” 

And Matt, drifting peacefully down 
from some far peak of Nirvana, ask- 
ed, “Was that what you meant by 
help?” 

“I didn’t know what I meant. I 
needed help,** She smiled slowly, with 
her eyes as well as her mouth. “Sup- 
pose it wasn’t what I meant. Then 
what?” 

“Then I’ve callously seduced you.” 
He moved his head back a little to 
look her in the face. The change was 
incredible. “I was afraid you’d gone 
off the beam for good.” 

“So was I.” 

Matt glanced up at the trapdoor, 
then stretched to reach for the sonic. 

“You really came to rescue me?” 

“Yah.” He didn’t mention Laney, 
not yet. No point in spoiling this 
moment. 

“Thanks.” 

“You’re welcome. We’ve still got 
to get out of here.” 

“You don’t have any questions to 
ask me?” 

What was she doing, testing him? 
Didn’t she trust him now? Well, why 
should she? “No,” he said, “no ques- 
tions. But there are things I’ve got to 
tell you — ” 

She stiffened. “Matt. Where are 
we?** 

“In the Hospital. Deep in the Hos- 
pital. But we can get out.” 

137 



SIOWBOAT CARGO 




S he rolled away and came to her 
feet in one smooth motion. 
“We’re in one of the slowboats! 
Which one?” 

“The Planck, Does it matter?” 

She scooped the other guard’s sonic 
stunner from his holster in what look- 
ed like a racing dive. “We can set 
off the fusion plant! Blow the Hos- 
pital and the crew into the void mist! 
Come on, Matt, let’s get moving. 
Are there guar^ in the corridor? 
How many?” 

“Set off — Are you out of your 
mind?” 

“We’d wipe out the Hospital and 
most of Alpha Plateau.” She picked 
up her ripped mock-playsuit and 
threw it down again. “I’ll have to 
pants one of these police. And that’ll 
be it! We’ll win, Matt! All in one 
stroke!” 

“What win? We’ll be deadr 
She stood up with her hands on 
her hips and regarded him with dis- 
gust. Now she wore a pair of Imple- 
mentation uniform pants, too big for 
her. Matt had never seen anyone 
more thoroughly alive. “I’d forgotten. 
You aren’t a Son of Earth. All right. 
Matt, see how far you can get. You 
may be able to get out of range of 
the blast. Personally, I doubt it.” 
“I’ve got a personal interest in you. 
I didn’t come all this way to have 
you commit suicide. You’re coming 
with me.” 

Polly donned a guard’s shirt, then 
hurriedly rolled up the pants, which 
were much too long. “You’ve done 
your duty. I’m not ungrateful. Matt, 
but we just aren’t going in the same 
direction. Our motives aren’t the 
same.” She kissed him hard, pushed 



him back and whispered, “I can’t 
pass up this chance.” She started for 
the ladder. 

Matt blocked her way. “You 
haven’t a prayer of getting anywhere 
without me. You’re coming with me, 
and we’re leaving the Hospital, if 
we get that far.” 

Polly hit him. 

She struck him with stiffened fin- 
gertips just under the sternum, where 
the ribs make an inverted V. He 
doubled up, trying to curt around the 
pain, not yet trying to breath, but 
gaping like a fish. He felt fingers at 
his throat, and realized that she’d seen 
the gas filter and was taking it. 

He saw her as a blur at the corner 
of his eye, climbing the ladder. He 
heard the door open and, a moment 
later close. Slow fire was spreading 
through his lungs. He tried to draw 
air, and it hurt. 

He’d never learned to fight. “The 
luck of Matt Keller” had made it 
unnecessary. Once he’d struck a 
guard on the point of the jaw. Where 
else would you hit somebody? And 
who’d guess that a lightly built girl 
could hit so hard? 

Inch by inch he uncurled, straight- 
ened up. He drew his breath in shal- 
low, painful sips. When the pain over 
his heart would let him move again, 
he started up the ladder. 

XXVI 

P olly moved at a gliding run. The 
gas filter was in place over her 
nose. She held the sonic straight out 
ahead of her, pointed around the 
curve of the inner hull. If an enemy 
appeared, that was where he would 

IF 



138 




be, right in the gunsight Nobody 
would come at her from behind. She 
was moving too fast 

As one of the inner core of the 
Sons of Earth, Polly knew the Planck 
as well as she knew her own home. 
The flight control room was a dia- 
meter’s distance from the airlock. 
She ticked off the doors as she passed 
under them. Hydroponics ... Li- 
brary .... 

Flight control. The door was clos- 
ed. No ladder. 

Polly crouched and sprang. She 
caught the handle at the top of her 
leap. The door was not locked; it was 
'dosed, because nobody ever used the 
flight control room. Unfortunately 
the door opened inward, upward. She 
dropped back, frustrated, landing si- 
lently on her toes. 

If she’d chosen the fusion room 
. but the fusion room was for fine 
control. There, the Hospital electri- 
cians kept power running to the col- 
onist regions. She’d have run into 
people, and they might have stopped 
her. 

The guard had carried a wallet. 

She leapt again, caught the knob 
and turned it, pushed the wallet be- 
tween the door and the jamb, where 
the catch of the lock ought to be. 
Again she dropped, and again she 
leapt. This time she slapped the flat 
of her hand hard against the door. It 
flipped upward . and over. 

Far down the curve of the corridor, 
someone yelled, “What’s going on 
down there?” 

Polly’s chest heaved, pulling deep 
lungfulls of air through her nose, 
under perfect control. She jumped a 
last time, caught the jamb and pulled 



herself up. Heavy footsteps • • « • 
Before someone could come into sigjit 
she had closed the door. 

There was a ladder h^e, built into 
what had been the ceiling. Doubt- 
less the Planck's original crew had 
used it to climb down from those six 
control chairs after the First Land- 
ing. Polly used it now. 

She squirmed into the second seat 
on the left and found the control 
panel, and the bypass. Part of the 
wall had been pri^ up, and a simple 
iron bar had been welded into place 
between two plates, removing control 
from the flight control room and giv- 
ing it directly to the fusion room. In 
flight both control points had been 
necessary: the fusion room to keep 
the drive working and stable, and the 
flight control room to keep it pointed. 
Now the fusion drive was used only 
for making electricity, and Polly’s 
control panel was dead. 

She went down the ladder, fast. 
There was a tool closet by the door 
If it held a welding arc — 

It did. 

And if there was no anesthetic gas 
around — or if it wasn’t inflam- 
mable — 

Nothing exploded as she turned on 
the welder. She began welding the 
door shut. 

Almost immediately she attracted 
attention. She could hear excited 
voices, muffled by the door. Then 
there was a faint numbness of a sonic 
beamer. The door didn’t conduct sub- 
sonics well: but she couldn’t take it 
for long. Nonetheless she finished the 
welding job before she went back up 
the ladder. 

She used the welding arc to cut 

139 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 




away the bypass. It was slow work. 
Implementation would surely have 
barged in on her before she finished. 
Now, they could whistle for entrance. 
She had all the time in the world. 
In their world. 

M att reached the corridor and be- 
gan to walk, leaving the inter- 
rogation room open behind him. He 
walked bent, with his chest half col- 
lapsed and Ws arms folded over the 
pain. He’d forgotten to take the re- 
maining sonic. 

“I’m not the domineering type,” 
he muttered, perversely enjoying the 
sound of his own voice. And, “Either 
that, or I’m trying to dominate the 
wrong women.” 

A heavy figure came poimding 
around the curve. Jesus Pietro Castro, 
wearing a gas filter and carrying a 
heavy mercury-sliver gun, looked up 
in time to avoid a collision. He 
jerked to a stop, and then his mouth 
dropped open as he took in blue eyes, 
blond hair, a bitter and angry col- 
onist’s face, an ear with a small piece 
bitten out of it and blood soaked into 
the collar of a ere wish over jacket. 
“You agree?” Matt said brightly. 
Castro raised the gun. The “luck” 
was off. 

And all the rage and humiliation 
in Matt broke loose. “All right,” he 
yelled, “look at me! Damn you, look 
at me I I’m Matthew Keller!” 

The Head stared. He did not fire. 
He stared. 

“I crashed my way into your crum- 
my Hospital, single-handed, twice! I 
came through walls and void mist 
and sleepy gas and mercy bullets to 
rescue that damn woman, and when 



I got her loose she punched me in 
the gut and folded me up like a 
flower! So go ahead and look!” 

Castro looked and looked. 

And finally Matt realized that he 
should have fired. 

Castro swiveled his head from side 
to side, in a negative motion. But 
his eyes never left Matt. And slowly, 
slowly, as if he were knee deep in 
hardening cement, he moved one 
slow step forward. 

Abruptly Matt realized what was 
happening. “Don’t look away,” he 
said hastily. “Look at me.” The Head 
was close enough now, and Matt 
reached out and pushed the barrel of 
the mercy-gun aside, still striving to 
hold Castro’s eyes. “Keep looking.” 

They stared eye to eye. Above his 
bulky false nose, Castro’s eyes were 
remarkable: all white and black, all 
whites and huge expanded pupils, 
with practically no iris showing. His 
jaw hung loose under the snowy han- 
dle-bar moustache. He was melting. 
The perspiration ran in slow streams 
into Ws collar. Like a man in an ec- 
stasy of fear, or awe, or worship 
... he stared. 

Contract the pupils of eyes not 
your own, and you got psychic invis- 
ibility. Expand them, and you got 
. what? Fascination? 

For damn sure, he had the Head’s 
complete attention. Matt drew back 
his fist, cocked it — and couldn’t 
follow through. It would have been 
like attacking a cripple. Castro was 
a cripple; one of his arms was in a 
sling. 

There was shouting from down the 
corridor, from the direction Polly 
had taken. 



140 



IP 




The Head moved another gluey 
step forward. 

Too many enemies, before and be- 
hind. Matt slapped the gun out of 
Castro’s hand, then turned and ran. 

As he dropped through the door 
to the coffin room, he saw the Head 
still looking after him, still held in 
the strange spell. Then he pushed 
the door closed above him. 

P olly cut the last of the bar away, 
and the control board came alight. 
She ran her eyes quickly over the 
lighted dials, then once more, slowly. 

According to the control board, 
the fusion drive was as cold as Pluto’s 
caves. 

Polly whistled between her teeth. 
It was no malfunction of the board. 
The several dials checked each other 
too well. Someone had decided to 
black out the colony regions. 

She couldn’t start the drive from 
here. And she’d never reach the fu- 
sion room; she’d locked herself in 
with a vengeance. 

If only this had been the Arthur 
Clarke! Castro would never dare cut 
power to the crew. The Clarke*s fu- 
sion plant must be going full blast. 

Well now, she thought in grow- 
ing excitement. She slid out onto the 
ladder. There might 4)e a way to 
reach the Clarke .... 

J esus Pietro felt a hand shaking his 
shoulder. He turned and found 
Major Jansen. “What is it?” 

“We’ve flooded the Planck with 
gas, sir. Everyone who wasn’t warned 
should be unconscious, unless he’s 
behind doors. I wish there weren’t 
so many filters floating around. 



though. Whoever we’re after has had 
too good a chance to pick one up.” 
“Good,” said Jesus Pietro. He 
couldn’t concentrate. He wanted to 
be alone, to think ... no, he didn’t 
want to be alone .... “Carry on,” 
he said. “Try the coffin room. He 
may be in there.” 

“He isn’t. Or if he is, there’s more 
than one traitor. Somebody’s in the 
Flight Control Room, welded in. It’s 
a good thing the fusion plant is off.” 
“Get him out. But try the coffin 
room, too.” 

Major Jansen moved off in the 
direction of all the commotion. Jesus 
Pietro wondered what he’d find, when 
he finally looked in the coffin room. 
Had Keller’s ghost really gone in 
there, or had he faded out while run- 
ning up the corridor? Jesus Pietro 
wasn’t sure. 

But he was sure of the ghost. 

He would never in his life forget 
those eyes. Those binding, blinding, 
paralyzing eyes. They would haunt 
him the rest of his life . however 
many minutes that might be. For 
surely the ghost didn’t intend to let 
him go now. 

His handphone rang. Jesus Pietro 
picked it off his belt and said, “The 
Head.” 

“Sir, we’re getting some very 
strange reports, said the voice of Miss 
Lauessen. “A large number of cars 
are converging on the Hospital. 
Someone claiming to represent the 
Council is accusing you of treason.” 
“Me? Of treason?” 

“Yes, sir.” Miss Lauessen sounded 
strange. And she kept calling him Sir. 
“What grounds?” 

“Shall I find out, sir?” 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 







“Yes. And order them to land out- 
side the defense perimeter. If they 
don’t set patrol cars on them. It’s 
obviously the Sons of Earth.” He 
clicked off and immediately thought, 
But where did they all come from? 
And where did they get the cars? 
And he thought, Keller? 

His hand phone buzzed. 

Miss Lauessen’s voice had turned 
plaintive — almost querulous. “Sir, 
the fleet of cars is led by Millard 
Parlette. He accuses you of malfea- 
sance and treason, and he orders you 
to give yourself up for trial.” 

“He’s gone insane.” Jesus Pietro 
tried to think. It was all coming at 
once. Was this why Keller had ap- 
peared to him, shown himself at last? 
No mysterious symbols, this time; no 
invisible breaking of fingers. Keller’s 
eyes .... “Try to land the old man 
without hurting him. The other cars 
too. Order them to set their cars on 
autopilot. Tell them they won’t be 
hurt. Give them one minute, then 
knock them out with sonics.” 

“I hesitate to remind you, sir, but 
Millard Parlette is your superior of- 
ficer. Will you give yourself up?” 
Then Jesus Pietro remembered 
that Miss Lauessen was almost pure 
crew. Did her veins carry Parlette 
blood? It was reputedly easy to come 
by. He said the only thing he could. 
“No.” 

The phone cut off, cut him off 
from the Hospital switchboard. 

H e’d gone off half cocked, and he 
knew it. Somehow Polly’s blow 
in the belly had made him want to 
die. He’d stumbled out into the cor- 
ridor to be captured. 



Not this time. He scooped up the 
remaining sonic and started for the 
ladder. This time he’d know just what 
he was doing when he went through 
that door. 

But why go through it at all? The 
thought stopped him at the foot of 
the ladder. If Polly was going to 
blow the drive — 

No, she’d never get that far. And 
she’d had all the rescuing she was 
entitled to. It was time to think about 
escape. He looked up at the exit — 
and shivered. 

Some escape hatch. The moment 
he poked his head out there, some- 
body would shoot at it. He had to 
see his enemy to use the “luck,” and 
he couldn’t see in all directions at 
once. 

Yet this room was no place to 
stand off a siege. All anyone would 
have to do would be to fire mercy- 
needles down toward the floor. If he 
looked before he fired, the “luck” 
would get him; but that statement 
applied to an ordinary sonic stunner. 
And so he wouldn’t look. 

He had to get out. 

But — Castro’s nosepiece. It meant 
Implementation was using gas. The 
corridor must be already full of it. 

Too many things to think about! 
Matt cursed and began going through 
a guard’s pockets. The guard stirred 
and tried to strangle Matt with limp 
fingers. Matt played the sonic over 
both guards, then finished his search. 
Neither guard had a gas filter. 

Matt looked up at the door. He 
could chance it, of course ... but 
if there was gas in the corridor, only 
that airtight door was protecting him 
now. It had to be airtight, of course.

IF 




Get to another room? There were 
the doors leading to what must be 
bedrooms. But they were halfway up 
the halls and too far from the la^er. 

And there, just under the exit, was 
a small door placed where any good 
apartment would have a coat closet. 
He might be able to reach it. 

XXVII 

I t wasn’t a coat closet, of course. It 
held two spacesuits. 

And it wasn’t easy to reach. Matt 
had to lean far out from the ladder 
to turn the knob, let the door fall 
open, and then jump for the opening. 
Leaving the cubbyhole would be just 
as bad, when the time came. 

Spacesuits. They had hung on 
hooks; now they sprawled on the 
floor like empty men. Thick rubbery 
fabric, with a heavy metal neck ring 
set with clamps to hold the separate 
helmet. Metal struts in the fabric 
braced the rocket backpack and the 
control unit under the chin. 

Would the air converter still work? 
Ridiculous, after three hundred years. 
But there might still be air in the 
tank. Matt found a knob in the con- 
trol panel of one suit, twisted it and 
got a hiss. 

So there was still stored air. The 
suit would protect him against gas. 
And the big fishbowl of a helmet 
would not interfere with his vision, 
nor his “luck.” 

He snatched up the gun when the 
door to the corridor dropped open. 
A long moment later, two legs came 
into sight on the ladder. Matt played 
the sonic over them. A man grunted 
in surprise and toppled into view. 



A voice of infinite authority spoke. 
“You! Come out of there!” 

Matt grinned to himself. Quietly 
he put the gun aside and reached for 
the suit. A wave of dizziness made 
the world go dreamy. He’d been right 
about the gas. 

He turned the air knob on full and 
put his head through the neck ring. 
He took several deep breaths, then 
held his breath while he slid feet 
first into the suit. 

“You haven’t got a chance! Come 
on out or we’ll come in after you!” 
Do that. Matt pulled the helmet 
over his head and resumed breathing. 
The dizziness was passing, but he had 
to move carefully. Especially since 
the suit was a size too small for him. 

The door dropped open suddenly, 
and there was a spattering of mercy- 
slivers. A snarling face and a hand 
came into view, the hand firing a 
mercy-gun. Matt shot at the face. 
The man slumped, head down, but 
he didn’t fall; someone pulled him 
up out of sight by his ankles. 

The air in the suit had a metallic 
smell thick enough to cut. Matt 
wrinkled his hose. Anyone else would 
have been satisfied with one escape 
from the Hospital. Who but Lucky 
Matt Keller would have — 

There was a roar like a distant, 
continuous explosion. What, Matt 
wondered, are they trying now? 

The ship shook and shook again. 
Matt found himself bouncing about 
like a toy in a box. Somehow he 
managed to brace his feet and shoul- 
ders against walls. / thought the son 
of a bitch was bluffing! He snatched 
at the stunner as it threatened to 
slide out into space. 



SLOWBOAT CARGO

The ship jumped, slapping hard 
against his cheekbone, as one whole 
wall of the ship ripped away. The 
roar was suddenly louder, much loud- 
er. 

itXT^e’re too close,” said Parlette. 

VV Hood, in the driver’s seat, 
said, “We have to be close enough 
to give orders.” 

“Nonsense. You’re afraid someone 
will call you a coward. Hang back, 
I tell you. Let my men do the fight- 
ing. They know what they’re doing. 
We’ve practiced enough.” 

Hood shrugged and eased back on 
the 3-4 throttle. Already theirs was 
the last car in a swarm of more than 
forty, an armada of floating red tail- 
lights against the starry night. Each 
car carried two of Parlette’s line, a 
driver and a gunman. 

Parlette, hovering like a vulture 
over the car’s phone, suddenly crow- 
ed, “I’ve got Deirire LaussenI All 
of you be quiet. Listen, Deidre, this 
is an emergency . .” 

And the others, Harry Kane and 
Lydia Hancock and Jay Hood, lis- 
tened while Parlette talked. 

It took him several minutes, but at 
last he leaned back, smiling with 
carnivorous white teeth. “I’ve done it. 
She’ll put our accusation on the in- 
tercom. Now we’ll have Implemen- 
tation fighting each other.” 

“You’ll have a tough time justify- 
ing that accusation,” Harry Kane 
warned him. 

“Not at all. By the time I finished 
I could convince Castro himself that 
he was guilty of treason, malfeasance 
of duty and augmented incest. Pro- 
vided — ” He paused for effect. 



“Provided we can take the Hospital. 
If I control the Hospital, they’ll be- 
lieve me. Because I’ll be the only 
one talking. 

“The main point is this. In law I 
am the man in charge of the Hos- 
pital, and have been since Castro 
was the size of Hood. If it weren’t 
me it would be some other crew, of 
course. In practice, it’s Castro’s Hos- 
pital, and I have to take it away 
from him. We have to have control 
before we can begin changing the 
government of Mount Lookitthat. 
But once I’ve got control, I can keep 
it.” 

“Look ahead.” 

“Police cars. Not many.” 

‘Tight formation. I wonder if 
that’s good? None of us ever had any 
training in dogfights.” 

“Why didn’t you fight each other?” 
“We expected to fight,” said Par- 
lette. “We never expected to fight 
the Hospital. So we — ” 

“What the Mist Demons is that 
over there?” 

Parlette was leaning far forward 
in his seat, his mismatched hands 
bracing him against the dashboard. 
He didn’t answer. 

Harry shook his shoulder. “What 
is it? It looks like fire all around one 
end of the Hospital.” 

Parlette seemed to be paralyzed 
ivith shock. 

And then one whole end of the 
Hospital detached itself from the 
main structure and moved sedately 
away. Orange flame bloomed all 
around its base. 

“That,” said Millard Parlette, “is 
the Planck taking off on its landing 
motors.”

IF 




P olly was in the upper left hand 
seat. She manipulated the con- 
trols in front of her with extreme del- 
icacy; but still the knobs turned in 
short jumps. Minute flakes of rust 
must be coming loose, somewhere in 
the chain of command which led 
from this control chair to the fission 
piles. 

Finally the piles were hot. 

And Polly tried the water valves. 
It seemed to her that long ago, 
someone had decided to keep the 
slowboats ready for a fast takeoff. 
It must have been during the first 
years of the colony, when nobody, 
crew or colonist, had been sure that 
an interstellar colony was possible. 
Then — others had forgotten, and 
the only changes made since then had 
been the necessary ones. 

Until the slowboats themselves 
were part of the structures of the 
Hospital, and the interiors of the 
lifesystems were a maze of ladders 
and jury-rigs. Until the organ banks 
were moved entirely out of the ships, 
and the suspended animation rooms 
were closed off for good. Until the 
ships were nothing more than electri- 
cal generating plants — if one turned 
a blind eye to the interrogation room, 
and perhaps to other secrets. 

And still the tool closets were un- 
disturbed. And still there were space- 
suits in the upended rooms, behind 
doors which hadn’t been opened for 
centuries. 

And still there was water in the 
landing fuel tanks and uranium in 
the landing motors. Nobody had 
bothered to remove them. The water 
had not evaporated, not from tanks 
made to hold water for thirty years 



against interstellar vacuum. The uran- 
ium — 

Polly valved water into the hot 
motors, and the ship roared. She yip- 
ped in triumph. The ship shuddered 
and shook along her whole length. 
From beneath the welded door there 
were muffled screams. 

There was more than one way to 
tell a joke! The Planck* s fusion drive 
was dead, but the Arthur Clarke* s 
drive must be running hot. And when 
Polly dived the Planck on it from 
the edge of atmosphere, the explosion 
would tear the top from Alpha Pla- 
teau! 

“Come loose,” she whispered. 

The Planck pulled loose from the 
rock around it, rose several feet and 
settled, mushily. The huge ship seem- 
ed to be bouncing ponderously on 
something soft. Polly twisted the 
water fuel valve to no effect. Water 
and pile were running at peak. 

Polly snarled low in her throat. 
The pile must be nearly dead: it 
couldn’t even manage to lift the ship 
against Mount Lookitthat’s point 
eight gee. If it weren’t for the landing 
skirt, guiding the blast for a ground 
effect, they wouldn’t be moving at 
all! 

Polly reached far across to the seat 
on her right. A bar moved under her 
hand, and, at the aft end of the 
Planck, two fins moved in response. 
The ship listed to the side and drifted 
back to nudge the Hospital, almost 
gently, once, twice. 

Live flame roared through the Hos- 
pital. It was water vapor heated be- 
yond incandescence, to the point 
where oxygen disassociated itself 
from hydrogen, and it cut where it 



146 



IP 




hit. Like death’s hurricane it roared 
through the corridors, cutting its way 
through walls where there were no 
corridors. It killed men before they 
knew what was killing them, for the 
first touch of the superheated steam 
made them blind. 

The drive flame spread its fiery 
death through a> third of the ground 
floor. 

To men inside and outside the Hos- 
pital, to men who had never met and 
never would, this was the night every- 
thing happened at once. Sane men 
locked their doors and found some- 
thing to hide under while they waited 
for things to stop happening. 

iij aney. It must be Laney,” said 
-L' Jay Hood. “She got through.” 
“Elaine Mattson?” 

“Right. And she got to the Planck. 
Can you imagine?” 

“She must have a wonderful sense 
of timing. Do you know what will 
happen when she blows the drive?”^ 
“Oh, my god. What’ll we do?” 
“Keep flying,” said Parlette. “We’d 
never get out of range now. We might 
just as well bull through with this, 
and hope Miss Mattson realizes the 
colonists are winning.” 

“More police cars,” said Harry 
Kane. “Left and right, both . .” 
Polly touched the bar again. The 
ship tilted to the other side and began 
to drift ponderously away from the 
Hospital. 

She dared tilt the ship no further. 
How much clearance did she have 
under the landing skirt? A foot? A 
yard? Ten? If the skirt touched the 
ground, the ship would go over on 
its side. 



That was no part of Polly’s plan. 

Behind her, the door had turned 
red hot. Polly glanced back with bar- 
ed teeth. She moved her hands over 
the board, but in the end left the 
settings just the way they were. She’d 
have to circle all the way around the 
Hospital; but in the end she’d have 
a gilding run at the Arthur Clarke. 

And she’d hit it again and ag^ 
until one ship failed. 

She never noticed when the red 
spot on the door turned white and 
burned through. 

XXVIII 

T he ship jumped three feet up- 
ward, and Matt’s head snapped 
down against the closet floor. \^en 
he looked up, the outer hull side of 
the room was tearing away, like tissue 
paper except for the agonized scream 
of old metal dying. And Matt was 
looking straight into Castro’s office. 

He couldn’t think; he couldn’t 
move. The scene had a quality of 
nightmare; it was beyond the rational. 
Magic! he thought; and, Not again! 

The Hospital was drifting away, 
dreamlike. His ears had gone dead, 
so that it all took place in an eerie 
silence. The ship was taking off ... 

And there was no air in his helmet. 
The tank had held only one last 
wheeze. He was suffocating. He pull- 
ed the clamps up with fingers gone 
limp and tingly, tossed the helmet 
away and gulped air. Then he re- 
membered the gas. 

But it was clean, hot air, air from 
outside, howling through the gaping 
hole in the outer hull. He sucked at 
it, pulling it to him. 



SLOWBOAT CARGO 



147 




The ship was going up and down 
in a seasick manner. Wavering in the 
drive, Matt thought and tried to ig- 
nore it. But one thing he couldn’t 
ignore. 

Polly had reached the controls. 
Apparently she was taking the ship 
up. No telling how high they were 
already; the lights of the Hospital 
had dwindled to the point where 
everything outside was uniformly 
black against the lighted room. They 
were going up, and the room was 
wide open to naked space, and Matt 
had no helmet. 

The room seemed steadier. He 
jumped for the ladder. The suit was 
awkward, but he caught the ladder 
and made his way down, fighting the 
imbalance caused by his backpack. 
It wasn’t until he touched bottom that 
the backpack caught his conscious 
attention. 

After all, if the Planck*s landing 
motors still worked, why not a space- 
suit’s backpack? 

He peered down at a control pan- 
el meant to be read by fingertips. 
With the helmet on he couldn’t have 
done it. The backpack was studded 
with small rocket motors; he wanted 
the ones on the bottom, of course. 

How high was he now? 

- He tried the two buttons on the 
bottom, and something exploded on 
his back. It felt about right, as if it 
were trying to lift him. There was 
only one throttle knob. Doubtless it 
controlled all the jets at once, or all 
that were turned on at a given time. 

Well, what else did he need to 
know? How high was he? 

He took one last deep breath and 
went out the hole in the wall. 



He saw blackness around him, and 
he twisted the throttle hard over. It 
didn’t move. It was already on full. 
Matt had something like one split sec- 
ond to realize that the backpack was 
for use in space, that it probably 
wouldn’t have lifted its own weight 
against gravity. 

He hit. 

M oving carefully so as not to in- 
terfere with the men using weld- 
ing torches. Major Jansen peered up 
into the hole in the flight control 
room door. 

They had pushed a platform into 
position under the door, so that two 
men could work at once. The plat- 
form rose and settled, rose and set- 
tled, so that the major had to brace 
himself with his hands flat on the 
ceiling. He could see raven hair over 
the top of a control chair, and one 
slender brown arm hanging down. 

Jesus Pietro, standing below, call- 
ed, “How long?” 

“A few seconds,” said one of the 
men with cutting torches. “Unless she 
welded the hinge side too.” 

“Do you know where we’re go- 
ing?” called the Head. “I do.” 

Major Jansen looked down, sur- 
prised. The Head sounded so odd! 
And he looked like an old man in 
poor health. He seemed unable to 
concentrate on what was going on. 
He*s ready for retirement, Major Jan- 
sen thought with compassion. If we 
live through this — 

“I do,” Jesus Pietro repeated, and 
nodded to himself. 

Major Jansen turned away. He had 
no time to feel sympathy for the 
Head, not while this was going on. 



14B 



IF 




“She welded the hinge side,” said 
one of the cutters. 

“How long?” 

“Three minutes, if we work from 
both ends.” 

T he ship continued to move, drift- 
ing along on its cushion of fire. 
Fire swept along the edge of the 
trapped forest, leaving a line of lick- 
ing red and orange flame, ignored by 
the embattled aircars above. Present- 
ly there were explosions among the 
trees, and then the whole tongue of 
forest was aflame. 

Now the Planck had left the de- 
fense perimeter and moved into a 
place of shops and houses. The crew 
who lived in those houses were awake, 
of course. Nobody could have slept 
through that continuous roar. Some 
stayed where they were; some made 
for the street and tried to run for it. 
The ones who reached their base- 
ments were the ones who lived. A 
block-wide path of exploded, burn- 
ing houses was the wake of the 
Planck, 

But now the houses were empty, 
and they didn’t burn. They were of 
architectural coral, and they had been 
deserted, most of them, for upwards 
of thirty years .... 

“We’re through, sir.” The words 
were hardly necessary. The cutters 
were pushing the door aside, their 
hands protected by thick gloves. Ma- 
jor Jansen shoved through and went 
up the ladder with panic at his back. 

Polly’s control board bewildered 
him. Knowing that he knew as much 
about flying spacecraft as anyone be- 
hind him, he continued to search for 
the dial or wheel or lever that would 

SLOWBOAT CARGO 







change the Planck's direction. Finally, 
puzzled, he looked up; and that was 
his undoing* 

The flight control room was long. 
It projected through the cargo sec- 
tion to where the outer and inner 
met; and most of it was trans- 
parent. Major Jansen looked through 
the outer hull, and he saw what was 
happening outside. 

He saw the glow of the drive flame 
near the bottom of his view. To the 
right, a coral house exploding: the 
last house. Not far ahead, the black 
line of the void edge, coming closer. 

And he froze. 

“We’re going over,” said Jesus Pie- 
tro, standing under him on the ladder. 
He showed neither surprise nor fear. 

Major Jansen screamed and buried 
his face in his arms. 

Jesus Pietro squeezed past him and 
into the left-hand seat. His decision 
was based on logic alone. If Major 
Jansen had not found the right con- 
trol, then he was looking at the wrong 
pai^; and this was the only other 
control panel the colonist girl could 
reach from where she was sitting. He 
found the fin controls and tried them. 

The ship tilted back and began to 
slow. 

Still slowing, it drifted over the 
edge. 

Jesus Pietro leaned back in his seat 
and watched. The Planck was no 
longer supported by the ground ef- 
fect. Jesus Pietro felt a sensation like 
an elevator starting down. He watch- 
ed the cliff go by, faster and faster, 
a shadow. Presently it was half 
the sky, and the other half was stars. 

Prc^ntly the stars went out. 

ITie ship began to grow hot. It was 



hot and dark outside, and the ancient 
walls of the Planck creaked and 
groaned as the pressure rose. Jesus 
Pietro watched, waiting. 

Waiting for Matthew Keller. 

XXIX 

H e struggled half awake, desper- 
ate to escape the terror of sleep. 
What a wild nightmare that was! 
Then he felt fingers probing him. 
Agonyl He braced and tried to 
draw away, putting his whole body 
into it. His whole body barely twitch- 
ed; but he heard himself whimper. 
A cool hand touched his forehead, 
and a voice — Laney’s? — said, “Lie 
back. Matt.” 

He remembered it later, the next 
time he woke. He woke slowly, this 
time, with the images of his memory 
forming around him. Again he 
thought, What a nightmare. But the 
images came clearer, too clear for a 
dream, and: 

His right leg and most of his right 
side were as numb as frozen pork. 
Parts of him were not numb; they 
ached and stung and throbbed. Again 
he tried to withdraw from the pain, 
but this time he was tied down. He 
opened his eyes to find himself sur- 
rounded. 

Harry Kane, Mrs. Hancock, Laney 
and several others he didn’t recog- 
nize all crowded around his strange 
bed. One was a big woman with red 
hands and somewhat crewish features, 
wearing a white smock. Matt dis- 
liked her at once. He’d seen such 
smocks in the organ banks. 

“He’s awake.” The woman in 
white spoke with a throaty lilt. Don’t

try to move, Keller. You’re all splint- 
ed up. These people want to talk to 
you. If you get tired, tell me right 
away and I’ll get them out of here.” 
“Who are you?” 

Harry Kane stepped forward. 
“She’s your doctor, Keller. How do 
you feel?” 

How did he feel? A moment ago 
he’d realized, too late, that his back- 
pack wouldn’t lift him. But he 
couldn’t remember the mile-long fall. 
“Am I going to die?” 

“No, you’ll live,” said the woman 
doctor. “You won’t even be crippled. 
The suit must have braced you 
against the fall. You broke a leg and 
some ribs, but they’ll heal, if you fol- 
low orders.” 

“All right,” said Matt. Nothing 
seemed to matter much. Was he dop- 
ed? He saw that he was on his back, 
with one leg in the air and some- 
thing bulky around his ribcage, in- 
terfering with his breathing. “Did 
they put transplants in me?” 

“Never mind that now, Keller You 
just rest and get well.” 

“How’s Polly?” 

“We couldn’t find her.” 

“She was on the Planck, She must 
have reached the drive controls.” 
“Oh!” Laney exclaimed. She start- 
ed to say something, then changed 
her mind. 

Harry said, “The Planck went over 
the edge.” 

“I see.” 

“You got her loose?” 

“I got her loose once,” Matt said. 
The faces were growing hazy. “She 
was a fanatic. All of you, fanatics. 
She had all the rescuing I could give 
her.” 



The room drifted away, dreamlike, 
and he knew the Planck was taking 
off. From a distance a woman’s auth- 
oritarian crew lilt ordered, “Out, now, 
all of you.” 

T he doctor escorted them to the 
door, and Harry Kane put» a 
hand on her elbow and took her with 
them into the corridor. There be ask- 
ed, “How long before he’s well?” 
“Let go of me, Mr. Kane.” 

Harry did. “How long?” 

“Don’t worry, he’ll be no invalid. 
In a week we’ll put him in a walking 
cast. In a month, we’ll see.” 

“How long before he’s back at 
work?” 

“Two months, with luck. Why so 
eager, Mr. Kane?” 

“Top secret.” 

The woman scowled. “Whatever 
you’re planning for him, you can 
bear in mind that he’s my patient. He 
won’t be ready for anything else until 
I tell you so.” ^ 

“All right. I suggest you donT tell 
him about the transplants. He 
wouldn’t like that.” 

“They’re in his records. I can’t do 
anything about that. I won’t tell him 
anything.” 

When she had left them, Laney 
asked, “Why so eager?” 

“I have an idea about Matt I’ll 
tell you about it later.” 

“Don’t you think we’ve used him 
enough?” 

“No,” said Harry Kane. “I’d like 
to, but no.” 

M illard Parlette was near exhaus- 
tion. He’d moved into Jesus 
Pietro Castro’s office on Sunday

night, even before the outer wall was 
replaced, and he’d lived there ever 
since. His meals were sent in, and 
he used Casteo’s cot when he slept, 
which was rarely. Sometimes it seem- 
ed to him that he was at the end of 
his life; that he’d waited just long 
enough to meet this, the crisis he’d 
foreseen a himdred years ago. 

The Planck had done terrible dam- 
age to the Hospital, but the work of 
rebuilding was well in progress. Par- 
lette had hired a construction firm 
himself, paying them out of his per- 
sonal fortune. Eventually he would 
push a bill through the Council to 
reimburse him. Now workmen were 
painting the outer wall of his office, 
which on Sunday night had been 
yawning space. 

His immediate problem was that 
at least half of Implementation want- 
ed to quit. 

The events of last week had had a 
disastrous effect on Implementation 
morale. Having the Head accused of 
treason, and deposed by force, was 
only part of it. Elaine Mattson and 
Matthew Keller had done their part, 
infiltrating the Hospital with bombs 
and stealth. The vivarium prisoners 
had been freed to make slaughter in 
the Hospital corridors. The destruc- 
tion of the Planck had affected, not 
just Hospital personnel, but all of 
Alpha Plateau; for the Planck was 
half of history. 

Now Implementation was faced 
with a dreadful confusion. All raids 
on the colony plateaus had been can- 
celed. Known rebels moved freely 
through the Hospital, and none could 
touch them. Their attitude toward the 
police was rude and contemptuous. 



Rumor had it that Millard Parlette 
was drafting new laws to further re- 
strict police power. It didn’t help that 
the rumors were true, 

Parlette did what he could. He 
spoke to every man who wanted to 
resign. Some he persuaded to stay. 
As the ranks dwindled he found new 
ways to use the men he had left. 

At the same time he was dealing 
with the Plateau’s four power blocs. 

The Council of the Crew had fol- 
lowed Parlette in the past. With luck 
and skill and work he would make 
them follow him again. 

The crew as a whole would norm- 
ally follow the Council. But a colonist 
revolt, in these days of a weakened, 
disheartened Implementation, might 
send them into a full panic; and then 
the Council would mean nothing. 

The Sons of Earth would follow 
Harry Kane. But Kane was beyond 
Parlette’s control, and he didn’t *trust 
Millard Parlette at all. 

The non-rebellious majority of col- 
onists would remain non-rebellious if 
Kane left them alone. But the Sons 
of Earth, with their privileged knowl- 
edge of the ramrobot gifts, could stir 
them to killing wrath at any time. 
Would Harry Kane wait for the Nev/ 
Law? 

Four power blocs, and Implemen- 
tation too. Being Head meant an end- 
less maze of details, minor com- 
plaints, delivery of reprimands, paper- 
work, petty internal politics ... he 
could get lost in such a maze, and 
never know it until a screaming col- 
onist army came to storm the Hos- 
pital. 

It was a wonder he ever got around 
to Matt Keller.

M att lived on his back, with his 
right side cased in concrete and 
his right leg dangling in space. He 
was given pills which reduced the 
pains to permanent, aggravating 
aches. 

The woman in the organ bank 
smock examined him from time to 
time. Matt suspected she saw him as 
potential organ bank material, of du- 
bious value. On Wednesday he over- 
heard someone calling her Dr. Ben- 
net. He had never thought of asking 
her name, as she had never thought 
of giving it. 

In the early morning hours, when 
the sleeping pills were wearing off, 
or during afternoon naps, he was 
plagued by nightmares. Again his el- 
bow smashed a nose across a man’s 
face, and again there was the awful 
shock of terror and triumph. Again 
he asked the way to the vivarium, 
turned and raised his arm to see the 
skin beaded with bright blood. Again 
he stood in the organ banks, unable 
to run, and he woke drenched in 
perspiration. Or, with a stolen sonic, 
he dropped uniformed men until the 
remembered sonic backlash turned 
his arm to wood. He woke, and his 
right arm had gone to sleep under 
him. 

He thought of his family with nos- 
talgia. He saw Jeannie and her hus- 
band every few months; they lived 
not twenty miles from Gamma’s ma- 
jor mining area. But he hadn’t seen 
his mother and father in years. How 
good it would be to see them again! 

Even the memory of mining worms 
filled him with nostalgia. They were 
unpredictable, yes, bu^ compared to 
Hood or Polly or Laney ... at least 



he could understand mining worms. 

His curiosity had been as dead as 
his right leg. On Wednesday evening 
it returned with a rush. 

Why was the Hospital treating 
him? If he had been captured, why 
hadn’t he been taken apart already? 
How had Laney and Kane been al- 
lowed to visit him? 

He was frantic with impatience. 
Dr. Bennet didn’t appear until noon 
Thursday. Somewhat to his suiprise, 
she was not at all reluctant to talk. 

‘T don’t understand it myself,” she 
told Matt. “I do know that all the 
live rebels have been turned loose, 
and we aren’t getting any more organ 
bank material. Old Parlette’s the 
Head now, and a lot of his relatives 
are working here too. Pure crew, 
working in the Hospital.” 

“It must be strange to you.” 

“It’s weird. Old Parlette is the only 
one who knows what’s really going 
on — if he does. Does he?” 

Does he? Matt groped at the ques- 
tion. “What makes you think I 
know?” 

“He’s given orders that you’re to 
be treated with an excess of tender 
loving care. He must have some rea- 
son, Keller.” 

“I suppose he must.” 

When it was obvious that that was 
all he had to say, she said, ‘Tf you’ve 
got any more questions, you can ask 
your friends. They’ll be here Satur- 
day. There’s another weird thing; all 
the colonists wandering through the 
Hospital, and we’ve got orders not 
to touch them. I hear some of them 
are proven rebels.” 

“Fm one myself.” 

“I thought you might be.”

“After my leg heals, will I be 
turned loose?” 

“I suppose so, from the way you’re 
bdng treated. It’s up to Parlette.” 
Her treatment of him had become 
curiously ambivalent. By turns he was 
her inferior, confidant and patient. 
“Why don’t you ask your friends on 
Saturday?” 

T hat night they hooked up a sleep- 
maker at the head of his bed. 
“Why didn’t they do that before?” 
he asked one of the workingmen. “It 
must be safer than pills.” 

“You’re looking at it wrong,” the 
man told him. “Most of the patients 
here are crew. You don’t think a crew 
would use a vivarium sleepmaker, do 
you?” 

“Too proud, huh?” 

“I told you. They’re crew** 

There was a listening bug in the 
headset. 

XXX 

T o Parlette, Matt was part of the 
paperwork. His was one of the 
dossiers lying on Jesus Pietro’s desk. 
Its cover was scorched, like the 
others; but the Head’s office, on the 
second floor, had escaped most of 
the damage from the Planck*s wild- 
fire drive. 

Parlette went through all those dos- 
siers, and many more. By now he 
knew that the worst threat to his 
“New Law” was defection by the 
Sons of Earth. Only they, with their 
presumed control over Ae colonists, 
could make it work; and only they 
were beyond his control. 

Matthew Keller’s dossier was un- 



usual in its skimpiness. There wasn’t 
even a record of his joining the rebel 
organization. Yet he must belong. 
Castro’s notes implied that Keller had 
freed the vivarium prisoners. He had 
been badly hurt invading the Hospi- 
tal a second time. He must be partly 
responsible for the Planck disaster. 
He seemed to be connected with the 
mystery of the bleeding-heart symbol. 
A very active rebel, Matthew Keller. 

Then there was Harry Kane’s dis- 
proportionate interest in him. 

Parlette’s first evanescent impulse 
was to have him die of his injuries. 
He’d caused too much destruction al- 
ready. Probably the Planck*s library 
could never be replaced .... But 
getting Harry Kane’s trust was far 
more important. 

On Thursday Dr. Bennet sent him 
word that Keller would be receiving 
visitors. Installing a listening bug was 
an obvious precaution. Millard Par- 
lette made a note of the coming in- 
terview — at Saturday noon — then 
forgot it until then. 

W hen Hood had finished talking, 
Matt smiled and said, “I told 
you they were little hearts and livers.” 
It didn’t go over. The four of them 
looked solemnly back at him, like a 
jury circling his hospital bed. 

When they’d first come in, he’d 
wondered if they were all slated for 
the organ banks. They’d been so 
deadly serious, and they moved with 
coordination, as if they’d rehearsed 
this. 

Hood talked for almost half an 
hour, with occasional interruptions 
from Harry Kane and no comments 
at all from Laney and Mrs. Hancock. 

IF 



154 




It still seemed rehearsed. You do alt 
the talking, Jay, someone must have 
said. Break it to him gently. Then — 
But what they’d told him was all 
good. 

“You’ve still got that bad-news 
look,” he said. “Why so solemn? All 
is roses. We’re all going to live for- 
ever. No more Implementation raids. 
No more being hauled off to the or- 
gan banks without a trial. We can 
even build wooden houses if we’re 
crazy enough to want them. The mil- 
lenium has come at last.” 

Harry Kane spoke. “And what’s 
to keep Parlette from breaking all his 
rash promises?” 

Matt still couldn’t see why it should 
involve him. “You think he might?” 
“Look at it logically, Keller. Par- 
lette has Castro’s job now. He’s the 
Head. He runs Implementation.” 
“That’s what you wanted, isn’t it?” 
“Yes,” said Kane. “I want him to 
have all the power he can grab, be- 
cause he’s the only man who can put 
the New Law across — if he chooses. 
But let’s just back off a little and 
look at how much power he does 
have. 

“He runs Implementation.” Kane 
ticked it off on a finger. “He’s trained 
his own clan to use hunting guns. 
That gives him most of the weapons 
on Mount Lookitthat. He can twist 
the Council around his little finger. 
Parlette is well on his way to being 
the world’s first emperor I” 

“But you could stop him. You said 
yourself that you can raise the col- 
ony against him any time you like.*^ 
Kane waved it off. “We can’t do 
that. Sure, it’s a good threat, espe- 
cially after what we’ve already done 



to Implementation. But we don’t want 
a blood bath any more than Parlette 
does, or says he does. No, we need 
something else to hold over him.” 
Four solemn faces waited for his; 
reply. What the Mist Demons was 
this all about? Matt said, “All right, 
you thought up the problem, now 
think up an answer.” 

“We need an invisible assassin.” 
Matt raised himself on one shoul- 
der, peered at Harry Kane around the 
white pillaf of his traction-bound leg. 
No, Kane wasn’t joking. The effort 
was exhausting, and he dropped back. 

Laney put a hand on his arm. “It’s 
the only answer. Matt. And it’s per- 
fect. No matter how powerful Millard 
Parlette becomes politically, he’ll 
never have a defense against you.** 
“It’s you or civil war,” Kane put 
in. 

Matt found his voice. “I don’t 
doubt you’re serious,” he said won- 
deringly. “I doubt your sanity. Do I 
look like an assassin? I’ve never kill- 
ed anyone. I never intend to.” 

“You did pretty well last week- 
end.” 

“What’ — ? I used a stun gun! 
I hit some people with my fist! Why 
does that make me a pro killer?” 
“You realize,” said Hood, “that 
we never intend to use you as such. 
You’re a threat. Matt, nothing more. 
You’ll be one leg in the balance of 
power between the Sons of Earth 
and Millard Parlette.” 

“I’m a miner.” Matt gestured with 
his left arm, the one that didn’t pull 
cracked ribs. “A miner. I use trained 
worms to dig for metal. My boss sells 
the metal and buys worms and worm 
food, and with luck he makes enough

to pay my salary. Wait a minute. 
Have you told Parlette about this 
idea?” 

iiXTo, of course not. He’ll never 
know about it, unless you 
agree, and then we’ll wait until you’re 
out of the Hospital.” 

“Mist Demons, I should hope so. 
If Parlette gets the idea I’m danger- 
ous to him — and me on my back 
like this — I want to be on Delta 
before you tell Parlette. Hell, I want 
to be on Earth before — ” 

“Then you agree?” 

“No, Kane! No, I do not agree to 
anything! Don’t you realize I’ve got 
a family? What if Parlette takes hos- 
tages?” 

“Two parents and a sister,” Hood 
amplified. “Parents on Iota.” 

“Don’t worry,” Laney said sooth- 
ingly. “We’ll protect them. Matt. 
They’ll be safe.” 

Kane nodded. “If anyone so much 
as harms a hair on your head, or 
threatens any member of your family. 
I’ll declare total war. I’ll have to tell 
Parlette that, and to make him be- 
lieve it I’ll have to mean it. And I 
do.” 

Matt thought very seriously about 
shouting for Dr. Bennet. It wouldn’t 
work. Even if she threw them out, 
they’d only come back later. 

And Matt Keller was a man on 
his back. He could move three inches 
to the side if he were willing to en- 
dure the pain. Four inches, no. A 
captive audience. 

“You’ve really thought it out, 
haven’t you? Why did you wait so 
long to tell me?” 

Jay Hood answered. “I wanted to 



be here. And this is my day off.” 
“You’re back teaching school, 
Jay?” 

“It seems appropriate to teach 
history while we’re making it.” In 
the dry voice there was a barely con- 
cealed jubilation. Hood was in his 
element. Strange that he’d never 
suspected the size of Hood’s ego. 
“You got me into this,” said Matt. 
“Sorry. My apologies. Believe me, 
Matt, I only picked you as a prob- 
able recruit.” When Matt didn’t an- 
swer, Hood continued, “But we do 
need you. Let me show you how 
much. You were dying. Matt — ” 
“Stop, Jay.” 

“He has a right to know, Laney. 
Matt, those ribs you broke tore up 
your lung and your diaphragm. Harry 
had to talk Parlette into — ” 

“Jay, shut up** 

“All right, Laney.” He sounded 
hurt. 

“Matt, we weren’t going to tell 
you. Really we weren’t.” 

Dead man’s flesh was a part of 
him, forever. Living under his rib- 
cage: a strange, partial resurrection. 

Matt said, “All right, Laney. How 
do you stand on this?” 

Laney looked down, then up to 
meet his eyes. “It’s your choice, Matt. 
But if we don’t have you, we don’t 
have anyone.” She seemed to stop, 
then hurried on. “Listen, Matt, you’re 
making a big thing out of this. We’re 
not asking you to rush right out and 
murder someone. We’d be perfectly 
happy to see you go back to your 
mining worms. For all we care, you 
can stay there the rest of your life, 
with a small extra income — ” 
“Thanks.”

“ — for being on standby alert. 
Maybe Parlette’s honest. Maybe he 
reaUy does want to make the Plateau 
a paradise. Maybe all is roses. But 
just in case — ” 

She leaned forward in the uncom- 
fortable hospital chair, gripping his 
wrist with one hand, looking deep 
into his eyes. Her nails cut the skin. 
“Just in case Parlette is ambitious. 
Then, we’ll need you to stop him. 
Nobody else will be able to do it.” 
“We must let him have his power 
now. Somebody has to take power, 
or there’ll be civil war. But if he 
needs to be stopped, and you don’t 
stop him, you’ll be a coward.” 

Matt tried to pull his arm away. 
Torn muscles reacted; it was as if 
he’d been kicked in the side with a 
lead boot. “You’re fanaticsl All four 
of you!” And he was trapped, trapped 
• • • • 

Laney let go. Slowly she sat back, 
her eyes soft and dreamy, with pin- 
point pupils. 

M att relaxed. The others were 
looking at nothing. Jay Hood 
was humming under his breath. Mrs. 
Hancock scowled at some unpleasant 
thought. 

“The luck of Matt Keller” had 
given him a breathing space. 

“The luck of Matt KeUer.” A joke, 
a shaggy dog story. If he hadn’t used 
the power to “rescue” Polly, she 
might be alive now. If he hadn’t come 
running to Jay Hood for explanations, 
he’d be back tending his mining 
worms. No wonder this form of 
“luck” had never appeared before. 
Perhaps it nev^ would again. 

It was a detrimental mutation. It 



had kept hini virgin until he was 
twenty-two. It had killed Polly and 
caused Laney to see him as a tool in- 
stead of a man. It had sent him into 
the Planck; he’d never have tried that 
without his psychological invisibility. 
Into the Planck Xo die; out, by blind 
luck, with a dead man’s lung. 

A man should have the sense to 
hide his differences. 

Too late. They would forget him, 
again and again, as often as he de- 
sired. But always they would come 
back. Matt Keller, tool, captive assas- 
sin. 

Not likely! 

“You,” he said. “Mrs. Hancock.” 

The others stirred, turned to face 
him, returned to the world in which 
Matt Keller was a factor to be con- 
sidered. 

“Mrs. Hancock. Do you have any- 
thing to say to me?” 

“I don’t think so,” said the middle- 
aged rebel who should have been a 
shrewish housewife. 

“You didn’t say a word while the 
others were browbeating me. Why 
did you come?” 

She shrugged. “Just to see what 
would happen. Keller, did you ever 
lose someone you loved?” 

“Sure.” 

“To the organ banks?” 

“My Uncle Matt.” 

“I did my damnedest to stop you 
from getting a transplant, Keller. Dr. 
Bennet says you’d have lived without 
it, but of course you’d have been a 
cripple.” 

“I’d have been just as glad,” said 
Matt, though he wasn’t sure it was 
true. 

“I wanted to smash the organ 



3LOWBOAT CARGO

banks the first chance we got. No- 
body else seems to feel that way. 
Maybe nobody else had a husband 
cut up for the organ banks.” 

“Make your point.” 

She shrugged again. “I don’t know 
if you’re as important as Harry says. 
It seems to me nobody could be that 
important. You got us out of the 
Hospital, right. Parlette would never 
have found us otherwise, right. We’re 
grateful, right. But did we have to 
cut up a man to show how grateful 
we are? You didn’t do him any good. 

“Well, he’s dead, and we can’t 
break up the organ banks yet. But 
we’re trying to change the laws so 
less people go into them, and then 
only the ones that deserve it most. If 
you were any kind of man, you’d be 
wild to help us. I say it’s all you can 
do for that dead man.” 

“For sweet charity.” 

Mrs. Hancock’s mouth closed like 
a trap, 

“I’m going to join you,” said Matt. 
“But not for sweet charity. And now 
I’ll give you my reasons.” 

“Go on,” said Harry Kane. He was 
the only one who didn’t show sur- 
prise. 

“I can’t go back to my mining 
worms. That’s absolute. But I’m no 
hired killer, and that’s for sure too. 
I’ve never committed murder. I 
haven’t wanted to, not often. If I ever 
kill a man, I’ll want to know just 
why I’m doing it. 

‘There’s only one way I can be 
sure I will. 

“From now on, the five of us are 
going to be the leaders of the Sons 
of Earth.” That, he saw, jolted even 
Harry Kane. “I’ll want a hand in all 



decisions. I’ll want all the information 
available to anyone of you. What do 
you say, Harry?” 

“Keep talkin.” 

Matt’s mouth was dry. Harry Kane 
didn’t like this, and Harry Kane was 
a bad enemy. “The Sons of Earth 
can’t commit murder without my 
consent, and I won’t give it unless I 
decide murder is necessary. To make 
that decision, I’d have to know every- 
thing, always. One more thing. If I 
decide one of you is trying to cheat 
me. I’ll kill him, because cheating me 
of information will be murder.” 

“What makes you think you can 
handle that much power, Keller?” 
Harry’s voice was dispassionate, 
merely interested. 

“I have to try,” Matt pointed out. 
“It’s my power.” 

“Fair enough.” Harry stood up. 
“One of us will be here tomorrow, 
with copies of Parlette’s New Law, 
in full. If we decide to make changes 
later, we’ll let you know.” 

“Let me know before you make 
the changes.” 

Kane hesitated, then nodded. They 
went. 

XXXI 

M illard Parlette sighed and turned 
off the receiver. 

Invisible assassin? 

An odd phrase to come from a 
practical man like Harry Kane. What 
could he have meant? 

Kane would tell him eventually, of 
course. 

Even then it wouldn’t matter. Kane 
could be trusted now, and that did 
matter. Now Kane had a hold on 



158 



IP 




Millard Parlette. Be it real or imag- 
inary, he would use that hold before 
he started a civil war. 

And Millard could concentrate on 
the man waiting outside. Implementa- 
tion had selected one of their number 
to present a set of grievances. The 
man must be getting angrier and 
angrier as he waited for the Head’s 
attention. 

Parlette used the intercom. “Send 
him in, Miss Lauessen.” 

“Good.” 

“Wait. What’s his name again?” 
“tialley Fox. Corporal.” 

“Thank you. Would you please 
send to Gamma and Delta and Iota 
Plateaus for records on Matthew Kel- 
ler.” 

“Done, mine ancestor.” 

Mist Demons! How had Castro 
put up with the woman? Parlette 
smiled. Why not? Let him take care 
of Implementation and the Council, 
and Harry Kane would take care of 
the rest. An invisible assassin had just 
lifted half the load from his back. 

CCTt’ll be one strange balance of 
-I power,” said Harry Kane. “Par- 
lette’s got every weapon on the plan- 
et, except for what we’ve built in our 
basements. He’s got all the electrical 
and medical facilities, and most of the 
wealth. And what have we got? Matt 
Keller.” 

“And lucky to get him,” said 
Laney. 

A red haired girl in an iridescent 
dress passed them, walking quickly 
down the corridor. A crew girl, prob- 
ably visiting a relative. They stopped 
talking until she had passed. Harry 
Kane grinned after her, grinned at 



her startled expression and at the way 
she’d quickened her step to leave 
them behind. They’d all have to get 
used to this someday; to the sight of 
colonists in the hallowed corridors of 
the Hospital. 

Jay Hood said, “Well, we’ve got 
him. Or has he got us?” He slapped 
the wall, making gunshot echoes. 
“Can you imagine what the historians 
will say? They may never figure it 
out.” 

M att lay on his back and contem- 
plated the ceiling. 

He’d made the right decision. He 
was sure of it. If he had a power, 
then someone had to have a use for 
it. 

He himself had none. 

A detrimental mutation is one that 
prevents the organism from surviv- 
ing long enough to breed. Matt’s only 
hope of becoming a father lay in 
suppressing the “luck” entirely, at 
least in his private life. An invisible 
man goes nowhere in a civilized so- 
ciety .... 

Someone entered. Matt’s eyes jerk- 
ed hard over, caught by the iridescent 
blue of her dress. 

“I beg your pardon,” she said, and 
turned to leave. She was tall and 
slender, and young, with dark red 
hair curved into impossible contours. 
Her dress was of a type never seen 
on Delta Plateau, loose and clinging, 
and it glowed, A face lovely in its 
strangeness, with flared nostrils and 
pronounced cheekbones, marked her 
as pure crew. 

“Just a minute,” Matt called. 

She turned in surprise, not at what 
he’d said, but at his colonist accent. 



SLOWBOAT CARGO

Then her back straightened and her 
chin lifted and her mouth became a 
hard, angry line. Matt flushed. 

And before her eyes could coldly 
leave him, he thought. Look at me. 

Her eyes didn’t turn. Her chin 
came down and her face went soft 
and dreamy. 

Keep your eyes on mine, he 
thought at her. I fascinate you, right? 
Right. Keep looking. 

She took a slow step toward him. 

Matt dropped the control. She took 
another step forward, and then she 
looked horrified. She turned and ran 
from the room, followed by Matt’s 
pealing laughter. 

Detrimental mutation? 

Maybe not. 

nphe Outsider ship was a Christmas 
X decoration, a ball of tinsel rib- 
bons looping over and under and 
around each other, never touching. 
It was the diameter of New York 
City, with about the same popula- 
tion, in beings like black cats-o-nine- 
tails with thickened handles. 

Miles ahead at the end of its teth- 
ering cables, the fusion drive spread 
dim light over the ship. The basking 
ramps cast vacuum-sharp shadows 
across each other, and in the border- 
lines between light and shade lay the 
crew. They lay with their heads in 
sunlight and their branched tails in 
shadow, soaking up energy through 
thermo-electric currents. Fusion ra- 
diation sleeted through their bodies, 
unnoticed. It was a peaceful, lazy 
time. 



Between stars there was little to do. 

Until actinic blue flame flashed 
across their course, throwing high- 
energy particles and electromagnetic 
fields about with carefree abandon. 

In moments the object was out of 
sight, even to an Outsider’s sensitive 
eye. But not to the ship’s instruments. 
In an hour the Outsiders had it nail- 
ed: position, velocity, mass, design, 
thrust. It was metal, mechanical, 
pushed by fusion and fueled by in- 
terstellar hydrogen. Not a primitive 
device, but — 

Built by potential customers. 

In every arm of the galaxy were 
Outsiders, using everything from pho- 
ton sails to reactionless, inertialess 
drives to push their ships: but always 
they traveled through Einsteinian 
space. Hyperdrive was vulgar. The 
Outsiders never used hyperdrive. 

Other species were different. They 
. preferred not to dawdle in space, en- 
joying the trip, sightseeing, taking 
their time. Usually they preferred the 
speedy convenience of the hyperdrive 
Blind Spot. Hundreds of times over, 
alien races had bought the secret of 
the hyperdrive from passing Out- 
siders. 

The trade ship swung easily toward 
Procyn and the human colony on 
We Made It, following Interstellar 
Ramscoop Robot #144. No chance 
of catching up, not at the customary 
.01 gee. No hurry. Plenty of time 

In two sparks of fusion light, an 
industrial revolution moved on We 
Made It.

Dear Editor: 

The letters from Wayne Spiceland 
Jr. and Frank Flynn in October Hue 
and Cry made it a special issue for 
me because of several things: For 
one, they certainly didn't ignore my 
letter in the April issue, and if 
there's anything I can^ stand, it's 
ignorance. (So that's a cliche. I 
still think it's funny.) For another, 
both leaped to the defense of Hein- 
lein, who is, in my opinion, one of 
the best writers now In print. In 
fact, my 14-year-old startled a 
teacher three years ago by saying 
“The best three authors in the Eng- 
lish language are Steinbeck, Hein- 
lein and Shakespeare" .... and 
though I'd enlarge the number a 
bit, I'd certainly include Heinlein. 

But I must be one of the worst 
writers, or my April letter suffered 
from exegesis (and it was in an issue 
I missed, so I can't check up). 

I still say that science fiction, like 
ALL stories, must entertain first of 
all or lose both its old and new . 
audience. This is not to say that it 
cannot carry a message or make the 
reader think; actually, as an ex- 
editor I insist that the reader must 
react (think) or the story is a fail- 
ure. There must always be a part- 
nership between author and reader: 
the author supplies the story, the 



reader supplies the reaction . and 
the author's ability to involve the 
reader through his special talent is 
the catalyst that sets off the reac- 
tion. All of the books listed by Mr. 
Flynn are entertaining stories about 
“real people" even when the people 
are dogs as in City^ by Simak, 
though a couple of them were less 
entertaining to me than others by 
the same author. 

Heinlein, Blish and Clarke may be, 
as Mr. Spiceland says, better than 
ever. They^ve always b^n top-notch, 
and maybe Moon is a Harsh Mis- 
tress is terrific even if I felt it a bit 
to professorial for my taste. 

But my main complaint is that, 
for the most part, too much of to- 
day's science fiction dis not written 
by such as Heinlein, BHsh and 
Clarke. The paperbacks, particular- 
ly, run chiefly to sword-and-soroery 
(and I defy you to find one of those 
that would make anyone think) or 
to blatant space opera. They are, as 
Judith Merril said in a recent book 
review of some specific books, 
“comic-strip continuity" though she 
says (to each his own ! ) that this “is 
not all a Bad Thing." As for me, 
comic- strip continuity lost its inter- 
est when I was around twelve years 
old at most. 

To change the comparison, we

might consider the technique of the 
motion picture or TV film. The 
extras or bit players may not even 
have a script, usually don’t. The di- 
rector tells them the expression, the 
action, the reaction he wants. May- 
be they move through at once. He 
calls for cameras. They perform 
their part, make their impression, 
and go off without ever knowing 
the total story. Even the stars, who 
do know the story, do a lot of their 
action in piece-meal. A fist fight, for 
instance may have the two actors 
sling a single punch over and over 
for the camera. When one is knock- 
ed down, the other may be no where 
near and the one who falls actually 
is throwing himself backwards . 
over and over until the '%ike” is 
good . onto a mattress which 
doesn’t show in the scene as finally 
printed. 

The result, maybe gripping and 
inspiring plenty of feeling and 
thought, is a compound of the au- 
thor’s ideas, the director’s direction, 
the actor’s technique. The miracle 
is that this fairly mechanical pro- 
cess can 'become a thing of art. Too 
many authors depend on these slick 
mechanics, on technique, and lose 
involvement and art of storycraft. 
But some of our very best writers 
sometimes become so involved in the 
idea (whether mathematical, soci- 
ological, or scientific) that they too 
lose the story, the human element, 
that draws in the new s-f reader. 
The addicts (like me and Flynn and 
Spiceland) may read the story by 
a favorite author and, even if we 
don’t like it as well as niost by that 
author, forgive the writer, and strug- 
gle with the ideas and hope for a 
better one next time. A Heinlein or 
a Blish CAN’T write a poor book, 
merely one that we like less than 
some other that he wrote, and that 



we like less because it is less hu- 
manly evocative. 

But assume the masters never 
write a poor book, as I assume. Still 
their books in any one year will be 
in a sad minority. This past twelve 
months I have bought perhaps 50 
paperbacks (or more). There was 
no new Heinlein, Blish, Pohl among 
them. Of the rest, maybe three 
would attract a reader new to s-f 
because they had a story and were 
not verbal comic-strips, space-operas 
or sword-sorcery fantasies. 

The current shorts, novelettes and 
novels in the leading magazines are 
far superior to the run-of-the-mill 
paperbacks. (And local bookstores 
on my last two or three visits had 
no hard-backs.) 

I still would like . some Heinleins 
like Door Into Summer, Double Star, 
Famham*s Freehold, Methuselah*8 
Children; more Pohls, more Cle- 
ments, more Clarkes. Maybe the top 
authors can’t turn out a manuscript 
as fast as the authors of the flood 
of potboilers, but until the public 
can get its baptism in the good sci- 
ence-ficion, the said public isn’t go- 
ing to start panting after books in 
what is a new field to so many. 

And why don't I write a good 
science-fiction book myself? Be- 
cause I can’t write one up to the 
best of Heinlein or Pohl, that’s why. 
But you asked for it, Mr. Spiceland. 
Maybe I will write one ... it might 
be better than a lot of the tripe I’ve 
read in the past year. I think I 
will! I — Alma McCormick, 4558
