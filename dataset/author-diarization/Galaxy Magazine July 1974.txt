VERGE FORAY 



I 

44*0 ayeal promton. I pre- 

-I\.sume.” 

The voice was an assured femi- 
nine purr behind Gweanvin Oster. 
She twisted her head to look up at 
the smiling woman, then rose from 
her chair at the work console. 

“Yes, I’m Rayeal Promton,” 
Gweanvin said, "and you must be 
Marvis Jans, girl security man.” 

The woman nodded. “How did 
you identify me so quickly?” she 
asked. 

“Because 1 was expecting you. 
What’s being done here on Narva, 
and more specifically here in Gor- 
deen Consolidated Systems Lab, 
calls for the presence of the Federa- 
tion’s sharpest security agent. 
That’s you. And you wouldn't come 
here and not take a look at your 
genetic sister. Of course, now that 
I've had a close look at you, 1 see 
that your nose is like mine . 
based on permanent bone instead 
of cartilage.” 

"And just what is being done in 
this building, Rayeal?” Marvis Jans 
asked softly. 

Gweanvin laughed. “Is this a 
friendly visit or a security inter- 
view? Okay, so I've guessed a lot 
more about this project than my job 
requires me to know. Does that sur- 
prise you?” 

“No." Marvis smiled. “A mind 
like yours is wasted on circuit 
growth technology, Rayeal. You 
should be a frontliner like myself. 



It’s far more challenging work.” 

“I don’t know,” murmured 
Gweanvin. “I’ve thought about it, 
but sabotage, spying, counter-spy- 
ing and other such derring-do 
strikes me as awfully masculine.” 

“Humpf! I like that!” 

Gweanvin giggled. “No aspera- 
tions on your femininity intended. 
Miss Jans. Maybe I’d be more 
willing to swash about with a 
zerburst pistol on my hip if my hips 
were as curvy as yours.” She 
paused, giving the older woman’s 
figure an admiring once-over. 
“Gosh, how gorgeous you are! I 
hope I’m that well-stacked when I 
grow up.” 

“Thank you, dear.” Marvis let 
her pleasure show. "You are 
twenty-seven standard years old, 
aren’t you?” 

“Yes. And you're about thirty- 
four.” 

“Right. If you develop at the 
same rate I did you'll start budding 
very soon, Rayeal.” 

“I’ve already started,” Gweanvin 
grinned, “and not a minute too 
soon to suit me. I’m tired of looking 
like a boy." 

“I wish you were a boy,” Marvis 
remarked wryly. 

“I'll bet you do.” snickered 
Gweanvin. Then she asked more 
seriously, “Any clue of where one 
might be?” 

“A male of our species? No, not 
a clue.” 

Gweanvin considered the under- 
tones of that brusque reply. “That

GALAXY 



bugs you, doesn’t it?" she asked. 

“When your urges become as 
strong as mine . She shrugged 
and turned away. “Isn’t there any 
coffee in this joint?” 

“Sure. Over here.” 

Gweanvin led the way to the 
spenser and drew steaming mugs 
for Marvis and herself. She motion- 
ed her visitor into a chair and 
seated herself nearby. 

“Why not talk about it?” she 
asked. “Your search for a male is 
no secret from me.” 

“Aha! Spying on a Federation 
security agent, hah?" 

“Oh. don’t be such a warrior!” 
snorted Gweanvin. “Of course I’ve 
been spying on you, and you’ve 
probably known it all the time! Or 
certain friends of mine have, but 
don’t fret. They’re security people, 
too. and haven’t told me any deep 
Federation secrets. They’ve merely 
kept me informed on your male- 
hunt." 

Marvis sipped her coffee. "I was 
kidding you. dear. Of course I 
know what you’ve been up to. I 
haven’t tried to keep my hunt all 
that secret anyway — because there 
may be a male somewhere as eager 
to find me as I am to find him. 1 
wanted a bit of publicity." 

“But nobody turned up?” 

“Oh. a lot of guys turned up, but 
not one of us. Some looked like 
good bets but cases of delayed ma- 
turity are not unheard of among 
ordinary homo sapiens; that’s all 
any of them turned out to be.” She 



studied Gweanvin’s face question- 
ingly. “Just how much did your 
friends tell you about my search?” 
“Well, they told how you finagled 
a permit to go into the Federation’s 
central personnel files and run a 
computer check for individuals 
with genetic charts that match your 
own. My name was the only one 
thrown out — and you already knew 
about me, didn’t you?” 

Marvis nodded. "Go on.” 

“All right. Next you enlisted 
Monte’s help. It assisted by work- 
ing out a scheme to get one of our 
agents into the Commonality’s per- 
sonnel files to see what they had to 
offer." 

“Monte's a he. not an it," put in 
Marvis. “The feel is definitely that 
of a masculine mind, as anyone 
who has ever been on Orrbaune 
knows.” 

"Which I haven’t," said Gwean- 
vin, “but we’ll soon know the feel of 
Monte’s mind here on Narva, won’t 
we? If the project’s a success, that 
is. Right?" 

Marvis gave her a cool smile. “If 
you expect a security agent to join 
you in loose talk about a secret pro- 
ject, dearie, think again. Get back 
to the subject." 

“Well, that’s about all I know, 
except that you had no luck with 
the Commonality files. All that 
search produced was another fe- 
male . somebody about my age 
named Gweanvin Oster.” 

Marvis nodded slowly. When she 
said nothing, Gweanvin added, 



THE FRONTLINERS 



9 



“I’d like to know more about that 
Oster wench.” 

Marvis smirked. "Don’t ask me, 
Rayeal, dear. Check with those 
spies of yours. If they can't tell you 
anything, tough.” 

“Not that tough,” Gweanvin re- 
plied equably. “If you find out Miss 
Oster has located a male — and 
that’s the only thing about her I’m 
really interested in — I’ll know soon 
enough. When you vanish into the 
Commonality.” 

Marvis gave a little chuckle. 
“You think I’d be so unpatriotic as 
to defect for a man?” 

“Yep. And so would I.” 

“Well . you could be right 
about that,” murmured Marvis. 
"Actually, Rayeal, I don't mind 
telling you about Gweanvin Oster, 
but there’s precious little to tell. 
She’s a Commonality frontliner. 
We’re unable to obtain data about 
her appearance, present activities, 
or whereabouts.” 

“Then . she may have found a 
male!" breathed Gweanvin, all 
wide-eyed ingenuousness. 

“Unlikely. Our information is 
fairly solid on one point — that she’s 
on assignment, not off in the 
bushes.” 

“Oh.” 

F or a while Marvis gazed at 
Gweanvin without speaking. 
“You needn’t peer at me like 
that,” Gweanvin protested. “I’m 
not Gweanvin Oster. and I’ve got a 
long pedigree to prove it.” 



“I almost wish you were,” grum- 
bled Marvis. 

"Why? Would you and the whole 
security bureaucracy enjoy looking 
like champion idiots?” 

“I’m referring to the odds,” 
Marvis said. 

“Which odds?” 

“Those against three mutant fe- 
males being born without a single 
matching male.” She frowned. 
“Don’t tell me that hasn’t occurred 
to you. too.” 

Actually, it had not, because 
Gweanvin knew there were only two 
females, not three. She realized she 
had made a slip with that “Which 
odds?” question . .a rather subtle 
slip, but one that could neverthe- 
less blow her cover sky-high . 
and just when her assignment was 
reaching the pay-off point. Had she 
shown dismay? No. Like Marvis, 
she had the ability to maintain a 
perfect poker-face at will. 

“Surely you understand the laws 
of probability better than that!” 
she exclaimed. "Or does security 
work dull the reasoning powers?” 

Marvis replied flatly: “I know 
the odds are eight to one against 
flipping a coin for three heads in a 
row. If there were no factors work- 
ing against the conception of a 
male ... if the odds were fifty-fifty 
in any given birth, then at least one 
of us three should be male.” 

Gweanvin laughed. “Have you 
actually done any coin-flipping re- 
cently?" she asked. 

“Of course not! Why should I?" 



10 



GALAXY 



“Try it sometime. It should 
make you happier about those 
‘odds’. 1 tried it myself not long 
ago, and flipped a sequence of five 
tails, one head, another tail, three 
heads, two tails, two heads, a tail, 
and so on. What were the odds 
against my starting out with a se- 
quence of five tails like that?” 

‘‘Well . thirty-two to one. But 
a run like that is unusual.” 

“Sure, but it happens! I made 
over a hundred tosses without 
getting another string of five. But 1 
had three fours, and five runs of 
three. 

“The point is, Marvis, that prob- 
ability works out to what we call 
‘the law of averages’ only when 
we're dealing with a statistically 
significant number of events . 
the more the better. A gambler can 
actually have a lucky streak, you 
know. But he doesn't leave the 
game a winner unless he gets out at 
the right time. If he keeps playing 
long enough, the law of averages 
catches up with him. Don't depend 
on what you’ve read about prob- 
ability, Marvis,’’ she concluded 
with a grin. “Get a coin and start 
Hipping it. The results should prove 
therapeutic." 

Marvis thought about it for a 
moment. “You’re right about 
mathematical probability. Rayeal,” 
she said at last, “but the circum- 
stances leaves the possibility open 
that something is repressing con- 
ceptions of males of our species." 

Gweanvin shrugged. “A possi- 



bility, sure. In which event, we’re 
not the next evolutionary step for 
man, just three more old maids in 
the making. And if so, so what? 1 
see no signs that man’s about to 
cave in for lack of a new breed, 
anyway. But 1 don’t really think 
that, Marvis. I think we’re being 
balked out of motherhood, tempo- 
rarily, by a streak of bad luck.” 

“I hope you’re right. 1 . .” 
Marvis paused in the listening atti- 
tude that told Gweanvin someone 
was speaking to her via her com- 
munications-implant. “Right away, 
Thydan,” she responded to the 
call, then looked up at Gweanvin. 
“1 must run along, dear. Some 
people I’m supposed to join for 
lunch." 

“Oh. I’m sorry. We’ve got so 
much to talk about,” said Gwean- 
vin, rising. 

“I’ll have some time later,” 
Marvis assured her, walking toward 
the door. “I’ll get in touch.” 

Gweanvin followed her. “One 
thing I simply must ask you now. 
You've been mature, sexually, for 
some years, Marvis. Are you sure 
we can’t procreate with an ordinary 
homo sap male?" 

Marvis paused on the balcony 
jutting into the building’s westwing 
scramble area and turned. "I’m 
positive, dear. And that’s not the- 
oretical." She gave a slight smile. 
“Maybe I did not bother with coin- 
flipping, but that I checked out 
with experiment. Many experi- 
ments, in fact. We’re a new and

cross-breed with the old.” 

“1 was afraid of that,” nodded 
Gweanvin, soberly. 

“Sorry. See you later, dear.” 

M arvis stepped off the plat- 
form and pummeted down- 
ward on semi-inert transport mode. 
Probably on her way to the tightly 
restricted basement test-chambers, 
Gweanvin guessed. She knew the 
project was due to reach its climax 
very soon, probably that very after- 
noon. The arrival of Marvis Jans 
made that almost certain . 

Across the scramble area from 
her balcony was the balcony and 
open door to Don Plackmon’s 
office, with his desk so situated that 
he could sit looking out. When she 
glanced that way she found Don 
watching her. She waved, and he 
waved back. Don was supposed to 
be a circuitry growth techni- 
cian . and he wasn’t too bad at 
it . but she suspected he also 
had a security function. On a pro- 
ject like this one of every two people 
were probably involved in counter- 
espionage. 

And how many were spy-sabo- 
teurs? 

None but her, she guessed. An 
operation such as this was too thor- 
oughly guarded. First, it took the 
ability to lie to an emo-monitor 
without detection, which was some- 
thing not one human in a thousand 
could do. Also it took a personal 
history that could be checked out 



by some of the most suspicious eyes 
in the Federation without revealing 
a flaw. That kind of cover took 
time, effort and money to build. 
Actually, it took a long-established 
family, one which had devoted it- 
self for generations to the job of re- 
sembling loyal citizens of the Lon- 
tastan Federation, for Gweanvin 
Oster to be "born into” — with a 
minimal and painstaking doctoring 
of public records — as Rayeal Prom- 
ton. 

And getting inside this kind of 
project required one more thing: a 
reason for being there. To work on 
something that would of necessity 
involve circuitry growth one be- 
came an expert circuit-grower. The 
more expert the better. And with 
her mental equipment, Gweanvin 
had not had too much trouble be- 
coming tops in the field, so far as 
the Federation was concerned. The 
Primgranese Commonality had the 
real leadership there, and Gwean- 
vin had the benefit of being coached 
for her assignment by some of those 
leaders. 

She knew more of circuitry 
growth than she was using on this 
project — and she was using more 
than her Lontastan colleagues 
knew. 

Thus, she might actually wind up 
a net contributor to the Lontastan 
project if she were caught, or her 
assignment goofed in any way. 

She returned to her work con- 
sole. It lighted as she sat down, 
revealing the bitbox diagram she 



12 



GALAXY 



had been studying when Marvis 
Jans interrupted her. In a sense, 
this was makework she was doing — 
the examination of alternate possi- 
bilities tot" the Lontastan version of 
a Bauble. Just in case the Bauble 
her section had completed, and 
that was now resting well-guarded 
in one of the basement test cham- 
bers, failed to work. 

She knew it would work . and 
do other things the Lontastans 
would find far less desirable. This 
territory had been explored by 
Commonality scientists over a de- 
cade earlier, after the success of the 
first Bauble telepathic-communica- 
tion systems led to a great deal of 
experimentation into the potentials 
of various Bauble-type constructs. 

Was anything happening in the 
test chamber yet? 

While continuing to gaze studi- 
ously at the console screen, she 
exteriorized from her body and — as 
an ego-field — dropped to the base- 
ment room. There she touched the 
Bauble gently, not really entering 
it. but establishing enough contact 
with it to use some of the special 
features its circuitry contained, fea- 
tures the Lontastans knew nothing 
about. 

She found the Bauble was un- 
changed. It was in contact only 
with the pedestal on which it sat, 
like a beachball-size pearl. Nor was 
any field, ego or electronic, imping- 
ing on it. Judging from the silence 
of the room, no human was in the 
test chamber where it waited. 



So Marvis Jans and the others 
who were to be on hand for the test 
probably actually were at lunch. 
Nothing would happen for at least 
an hour. And speaking of lunch . 
she had better start the afternoon 
with a full stomach herself. Her 
cover might be blown if her plans 
slipped just a little, in which event 
days might pass before her next 
solid meal.

S hf. walked out on her balcony, 
semi-inerted and soared across 
the scrambleway to Don Plack- 
mon's office. He watched her ap- 
proach, and stood up and stepped 
around his desk when she came in. 
He gave her a squeeze and a kiss to 
which she responded with casual 
pleasure. Don was nice — and hand- 
some as well. 

She pushed herself back from 
him after a moment and said. “1 
know I'm early for your invitation 
to lunch, Don, but I'm starving. 
Let’s go now.” 

“Sure, Rayeal," he agreed, nuz- 
zling her. "You always give me an 
appetite.” 

"For what?" 

He chuckled. “I’ll settle for food 
right now. Look. Old Marchell 
wants to join us. and much as I'd 
prefer to be alone with you, it's not 
good form to say no to the boss. I'd 
better give him a call." 

“Okay," she nodded. 

Plackmon tongued his toothmike

and commed briefly with Boll Mar- 
chell while Gweanvin considered 
the point that Marchell was not 
with the lunching group of bigwigs, 
which probably meant he would not 
be present at the upcoming test. 
Security wraps must be on very 
tight indeed to exclude one (and 
perhaps both) of the two major pro- 
duction chiefs, she mused. 

Plackmon reported, "Boll says 
for us to go on and he’ll join us in a 
few minutes." 

“Good. Let's go." 

They left the office and soared up 
through the scramble area to the 
dining garden level, which they en- 
tered and found a table for three 
where Marchell would see them 
when he arrived. “I’m going to try 
something on the ancient Egyptian 
menu today,” said Plackmon. 

“Go ahead. I’m in a steak and 
potatoes mood myself." 

He laughed. “You weren’t kid- 
ding about being starved.” 

They punched their orders, and 
Plackmon said, “Was that dish 
who came to see you who 1 think it 
was?” 

"How you ever get any work done 
with all your girl-watching. I’ll 
never know,’’ Gweanvin replied 
tartly. “Yep, that was my fellow 
mutant, Marvis Jans.” 

"You’re much prettier than she 
is," he murmured, leaning close. 
"She doesn’t have your full lips.” 
“Yeah, but she's got a lot of full 
other places I don’t — as you might 
just possibly have noticed.” 



Plackmon laughed. "Give your- 
self time. Rayeal. You’re beginning 
to bud very nicely.” Their lunches 
arrived and they busied themselves 
with eating for a moment before he 
said. “I find it very hard to think of 
you as a mutant, you know. You 
don’t look all that unusual. Neither 
does she. It’s hard to imagine your 
genes being so different from 
mine.” 

“Genetic tension," she replied 
around a mouthful of extremely 
rare steak. 

“Tension?" 

She nodded. “That’s part of evo- 
lutionary theory which post-dates 
Darwin by several centuries, after 
geneticists began to find out how 
such things really work. You’re the 
same species as Homo Neandertha- 
leitsis. who was chipping flint on 
Earth thirty thousand years ago. 
He was homo sapiens the same as 
you, but if you saw him you prob- 
ably wouldn't be sure he was even 
human — and he would be just as 
dubious about you. But still you 
could mate and produce off-spring. 
And knowing you, you probably 
would.” 

"Only in a pinch, my dear,” he 
chuckled. 

"The difference between you and 
Neanderthal Man can be summed 
up as genetic tension," she con- 
tinued her explanation. “The 
species changes, adapts to new en- 
vironmental demands and to so- 
matic responses to our conscious 
ideas of what man should be. 



14 



GALAXY 



Changes in the genetic structure go 
with these adaptations, but they 
aren’t the kind of basic changes 
that mark a difference of species. 
only the difference between indi- 
viduals or races within a species. 

“But they do place something of 
a strain on the original pattern. 
This strain, genetic tension, grad- 
ually builds toward a point where 
no further departure from the ori- 
ginal is possible without breaking 
the species pattern itself. Humanity 
reached that stage in late Earth- 
Only times, it seems. People have 
been pretty much the same ever 
since. 

"But in the meanwhile, we’ve 
changed our environment drasti- 
cally. We have our life-support im- 
plants that enable us to live on 
almost any half-way habitable 
planet — or go streaking through 
interstellar space stark naked, for 
that matter. We’ve found the psych- 
release techniques with which to 
clean up ourselves, as ego-fields, 
and eliminate insanity. We’ve de- 
veloped the econo-war as our major 
social institution, simply to make 
existence more of a competitive 
challenge than it would be other- 
wise. All of which adds up the fact 
that homo sapiens needs to change 
into something as different from 
present man as present man is from 
the Cro-Magnon. But he can’t, be- 
cause his genetic tension is already 
as tight as it can get. 

"So.'’ she finished, “here we are, 
Marvis Jans and myself — and 



Gweanvin Oster in the Common- 
ality. We have some structural dif- 
ferences that set us apart from 
homo sapiens, such as nasal bridges 
of solid bone. Also we mature more 
slowly and probably live longer. 
But the really important difference 
is that genetically we're a new 
species, with zero genetic tension. 
Our offspring can adapt like mad 
for a long time to come. They 're the 
ones who’ll really be different.” 

Plackmon nodded slowly, and 
started to speak but at that moment 
Boll Marchell joined them. “Hope 
I'm interrupting something inti- 
mate," he remarked, favoring 
Gweanvin with his best dirty-old- 
nian leer. 

“Rayeal was just explaining why 
my love for her is tragic," Plack- 
mon replied. “Sit down. Boll.” 

Marchell sat, punched his selec- 
tion on the menu. “Gene-crossed 
lovers, hah?" 

Gweanvin said, “I think Don’s 
real throb is for a big-busted visitor 
1 had this morning. His eyes bulged 
out into the scrambleway when he 
saw her.” 

“Marvis Jans?” asked Marchell. 

“Yes. Have you met her?” 

“Just briefly." 

“What do you think of her?” 

“Well, if you and she are does I’d 
hate to tangle with the buck!" Mar- 
chell chuckled. “She’s quite a doll, 
but hard nosec} in more ways than 
one." 

"One step farther from the pri- 
mordial fiat-faced apeman," said 



THE FRONTLINERS 



15 



Gweanvin. “Do you really find her 
formidable?" 

"Damned right 1 do. And you. 
too. That’s why I’d hate to tangle 
with a male of your species.” 

G weanvin thought about it. 

puzzled momentarily. “Oh, 
you mean because men are more 
competitive, more combative than 
women," she hazarded. 

He nodded. “Yours would make 
a terrific econo-warrior — if he 
bothered with the econo-war at 
all." 

Gweanvin considered the point 
with interest. She hadn’t thought of 
the missing male from that stand- 
point before. What Marchell had 
said about the male role was 
certainly true for humanity and 
numerous other species. 

“What else is the male’s job?" 
she asked. 

“Finding and courting a mate, of 
course,” said Marchell. 

“Well, ours is certainly goofing 
on that." she replied. 

"Or biding his time perhaps. I 
get the impression Marvis Jans is 
trying to do both his job and her 
own as well. The typical female role 
is merely to make known her pre- 
sence and readiness, by whatever 
means of communication is appro- 
priate for the species. Miss Jans has 
done that. Now she’s searching, 
and that’s usually the male’s prero- 
gative.” 

Gweanvin chuckled. "Then it’s 
enough for Marvis or me to an- 



nounce, ‘Here 1 am. Come get me.' 
And then wait for Mr. Super-Econo 
Warrior to show up." 

“Probably. And just keep your- 
selves amused in the meantime, you 
with the project and such as poor 
Don here, Marvis with her frontlin- 
ing and every homo sap who lays 
eyes on her." 

“Speaking of which, I have a 
hunch big things are about to 
happen on the project, now that 
Marvis has come to make sure our 
labs aren’t spy-infested. Pay-off 
time may be here, gents." 

Plackmon grinned. “You still 
think our project is Monte-relat- 
ed?" 

“What else?” she shrugged. “We 
are on Narva, a nothing-planet ex- 
cept for being Orrbaune’s nearest 
habitable neighbor — a mere six 
light-years away from where Monte 
is, of necessity, permanently lo- 
cated. And our section has been 
building a . .” 

“If you’re going to give us one of 
your speculative commentaries on 
the nature of the project,” Plack- 
mon broke in. mashing a button on 
the table's control box, “let’s keep 
it between the three of us." A 
baffle-screen snapped on surround- 
ing the table, effectively curtaining 
the occupants and their words from 
others in the dining garden. 

Marchell laughed. “We don’t 
need security agents with Don 
around," he said. 

“Yeah. I wonder sometimes if his 
interest in me is as ulterior as he 



16 



GALAXY 



pretends that it is,” said Gweanvin. 

"I'm merely a conscientious little 
econo-warrior.” Plackmon con- 
tended stoutly. “As you were about 
to say . 

“Well, our section has been 
building what we hope is a reason- 
able facsimile of the Primgranese 
Commonality’s telepathic trans- 
ceiver, the Bauble. We don’t 
know — or 1 don’t — what the other 
section’s been doing. But my guess 
is that they’re working on a com- 
munications link to tie Monte on 
Orrbaune in with the Bauble here 
on Narva. 

“Now, essentially, a Bauble is 
just a dead device,” Gweanvin con- 
tinued, with the eagerness of a 
bright child showing off its talent, 
“whereas Monte is a living being, 
not only capable of receiving and 
sending telepathic messages, but of 
originating thoughts of his own. 
This makes him far superior, and 
more useful, than a Bauble could 
ever be. But one shortcoming of 
both Monte and a Bauble is limited 
range. One can cover a single 
planetary system, and that’s all. 

“What we really need to get 
ahead of the Primgranese is a Fede- 
ration-wide telepathic comm sys- 
tem. something that can spread 
throughout our portion of the 
galaxy. Maybe it would be possible 
to link Baubles alone into that kind 
of network, but the Primgranese 
must be trying that, with no success 
that I know of. 

"Anyway, we have Monte, and 



would want him in our network. 
And if we have some linkage system 
to tie him in with a Bauble at inter- 
stellar distance, the logical place to 
locate the first test Bauble would be 
right here on Narva. Otherwise, 
this underpopulated ball of dirt 
would be about the lust place in the 
Federation to rate a Bauble.” 

She paused, looking at Boll Mar- 
cheil, then asked, "Well, what do 
you think?” 

Marchell grinned. ‘I think it 
would take one hell of a comm 
system to link Monte with the 
Bauble when they are six light-years 
apart." 

“Yes,” she nodded, “that’s what 
fascinates me. All our section has 
done is try to duplicate Primgran- 
ese work. But Hobard Dawnor’s 
section . gosh, I’d give my eye 
teeth to know what they've got!” 

“You never had any eye teeth,” 
said Plackmon. 

“Figure of speech,” she replied 
absently. “Of course the actual 
spanning-signal could be an ex- 
ceedingly broad-band version of 
standard subwarp communica- 
tions. What intrigues me is the 
nature of the interface between 
Monte and the transmitter on Orr- 
baune, and between the receiver 
and the Bauble here on Narva. In 
other words, how is telepathy trans- 
lated into transniittable signals, 
and how are those signals then con- 
verted back into telepathy? That’s 
the real breakthrough involved in 
this project.” 



THE FRONTLINERS 



17 



"And you can’t figure it out?” 
asked Marchell. 

“No. In fact. I bet Monte himself 
had to figure it out. Who else would 
know enough about telepathy?" 
She studied him closely. “You 
know if I'm right or not. Boll.” she 
accused, although she knew he did 
not. “but you won’t tell me.” 

He chuckled. "That's econo-war 
for you. Rayeal. Never let your 
right hand know what your left is 
doing.” 

“Suppose you are right, Rayeal," 
said Plackmon, wearing a serious 
frown, “don’t you think such a pro- 
ject has some disturbing implica- 
tions?” 

"I don’t see why it should," she 
lied. "I would think it might bother 
my new friend Marvis Jans, though. 
If Monte’s telepathic ability is ex- 
tended over the whole Federation, 
that'll put all our internal security 
agents out of work, her included." 

“That’s what I’m getting at,” 
said Plackmon. “Every Federation 
citizen’s mind will be subject to 
scrutiny. As matters now stand, 
those of us who prefer to keep some 
mental privacy have the option of 
staying away from Orrbaune. If 
your speculating is accurate, we’re 
going to lose that option." 

"That doesn’t sound much like 
the conscientious little econo- 
warrior,” Gweanvin kidded. “Ac- 
tually, though. I’m a little hesitant 
about giving up mental privacy, 
too. But if everybody else does . 
and the people on Orrbaune don’t 



seem bothered by it. They say 
Monte is a perfect gentleman and 
Very discreet. He doesn’t spread 
around the thoughts that need to 
remain private. And since he's not 
human, it doesn’t matter much if 
he knows a person’s thoughts. He 
doesn't take advantage. And if 
you’re worried about some kind of 
thought control, he steers totally 
clear of that.” 

"Now r , but will he always?” 
Plackmon argued. 

Gweanvin shrugged. “What’s 
‘always’?" 

Marchell put in, "The Primgran- 
ese gave up emotional privacy long 
ago. They use emo-monitor im- 
plants, and it doesn't seem to 
bother them. It merely improves 
communication." 

“We would have had emo-moni- 
tor implants of our own by now,” 
said Gweanvin, “except that if this 
project is a success we won’t need 
them — so they’re dragging their 
feet on getting them into produc- 
tion.” 

"You sound so sure of everything 
you say," laughed Plackmon. “Is 
that because you’re a woman, or is 
it a characteristic of the new 
breed?” 

“It’s because we’re having an 
argument,” she replied. “If I'm 
right about the purpose of the pro- 
ject I don't want my triumph weak- 
ened by a lot of ‘perhapses’ and 
‘maybes’. And if I'm wrong you 
guys won't be polite enough to 
remember any ‘maybes’ anyway.”

rr^HE lunchtime conversation was 
X a mild disappointment to 
Gweanvin. She had hoped to learn 
something from Marchell about 
plans for the test, but obviously he 
knew no more and had guessed far 
less than she had. 

After the normal amount of 
dawdling about after lunch, she 
returned to her work console and 
pretended to be absorbed by her 
task while she exteriorized once 
more and returned to the test 
chambers and the Bauble. 

She found it still untouched but 
now there were sounds in the test 
chamber. Equipment was being 
brought in, she judged. 

"This has to be turned slightly to 
the left," she heard someone say. 

"That enough?" said another 
voice. 

“Yes. Good. Now roll it closer. It 
has to be in contact with the 
Bauble.” 

"Okay . how's that?” 

Gweanvin felt the contact. Some- 
thing was touching the Bauble over 
about thirty per cent of one side of 
its surface. Aha! This was it! The 
interface system that she had to 
probe. She shifted all her attention 
to that part of the Bauble surface, 
but found nothing but touch-pres- 
sure. The interface was inactive. 

“Hadn’t we better switch it on 
and check for good contact?" 

“No. We turn nothing on until 
the test begins. Don’t worry about

We could rave on for paragraphs about 
James White's new novel for us: THE

since Galaxy had the great good sense to 
serialize this book earlier in the year, we 
need wax enthusiastic for only a few lines. 
For those of you who may have missed the 
serial, TDM is a cracking good sf yarn 
about an enormous starship set to travel 
through space for 1 ,000 years In search of 
a habitable planet for Man to settle. The 
passengers aboard this colony ship are all 
plagued by strange and dreadful night- 
mares. Unless the ship's commander, John 
Devlin, can find a way to control this dis- 
astrous dreaming, his charges may all be 
driven mad. All In all, a superb hard-core 
novel in the grand tradition! 



One of the things we like to do each year

the contact. It’s good, all right.” 

Footsteps moved away from the j 
Bauble and the test chamber was 
silent once more. 

Gweanvin used the delay for one 
last review of her contingency plans. 

The Gordeen Consolidated build- 
ing was not designed for the con- 
venience of spy-saboteurs. Its out- 
side walls were thick, tough, win- 
dowless. To leave in the normal 
manner meant going out on her 
balcony, semi-inerting, flying up 
through the scramble area to the 
roof exit seventy-one floors above, 
where one of the gates would check 
her identity and let her through. 

Minimum exit time: ten sec- 
onds . if she ran into no traffic 
jams, and // the gates had not been | 
alerted to detain her. 

Still, that would be the best way 
out if she had time to use it. If 
not . 

She opened a drawer of the con- 
sole desk, considered its clutter of 
contents, took a light-pen out of it. 
She used the pen to streak a pair of 
trial vectors across the diagram on 
the console screen, and gazed 
studiously at the result. 

The drawer’s contents were such 
as most anyone might accumulate 
over a period of a few years on a 
job. Some items, such as the light- 
pen, definitely belonged there. 
Others, such as a zercrown and a 
couple of sheets of slightly worn 
warprag, did not belong but were 
readily explainable, in case anyone 
asked. The warprags, for example.

she had swiped from one of the 
shops — which no one would mind — 
with the intention of taking them 
home to see how they would work 
as abrasives on gold sculpture, 
which she made in her spare time. 

Also, most of the jumble of stuff 
in the drawer was as harmless and 
useless as it looked; anyone would 
have to take a very close look in- 
deed to know that some of it was 
not. 

Unfortunately, she mused, sus- 
picion would have been aroused 
had she added a charged implant 
power-unit to the accumulation — 
and if things got really tight, she 
would doubtless need plenty of 
power in a hurry. She had an 
answer to that, of course, but it 
would have been better if . 

There was a murmur of voices 
and footsteps down in the test 
chamber. 

“If everyone will find seats," 
spoke an authoritative voice. 
“Thank you. Now, how are we on 
security, Marvis?" 

“We’re snug. Thydan,” the voice 
of Marvis Jans replied. "The Gor- 
deen people have done a good job 
of keeping this project tightly 
wrapped." 

There as a murmur of apprecia- 
tion, in which Gweanvin could 
make out Falor Dample's rumbled, 
"Thank you. Miss Jans." 

"This room could not possibly be 
bugged, then?” demanded a voice 
she did not recognize. 

“Not unless the Primgranese 



have developed an entirely novel 
technique," replied Marvis Jans 
with a touch of disdain, “which is 
most unlikely. And if they had, the 
likelihood of their both knowing of 
this project and getting an agent in- 
side approaches zero.” 



z~vKAY, Marvis,” chuckled the 
\ "man she had called Thydan. 
“1 have one specific question: what 
about Rayeal Promton?” 

“All clear there, and I might say 
Rayeal is drawing more security at- 
tention than she merits simply be- 
cause she happens to match a parti- 
cular Commonality operator in age 
and basic genetics. Admittedly, the 
question, ‘Could Rayeal Promton 
be Gweanvin Oster?’ is a tempting 
one to consider . and it has 
been — but just because it is such an 
obvious one the Primgranese com- 
mand would not have sent in the 
Oster woman on an assignment 
where ..." 

“They could have counted on us 
discounting our suspicions,” put in 
Thydan, "for that very reason.” 
"Well . the important thing is 
that right now, she is forty-one 
floors above us working in her 
office and under observation from 
across the scrambleway.” 

“I’d like to be sure she’ll stay 
there,” grumbled the man who had 
asked about bugs. 

"That can be arranged — if you 
think it’s necessary,” said Marvis. 
“Good. Arrange it.” 



THE FRONTLINERS

Thydan said, “One point that 
bothers me about Miss Promton is 
that she has speculated accurately 
on the nature of this project and 
has discussed her speculations 
rather freely." 

‘‘She’s a very bright girl," Marvis 
broke in. “If I were in her position, 
I would probably have drawn the 
same conclusions. And she has 
been discreet in her indiscretion — 
only with people such as her boss, 
and agents such as Don Plackmon 
and myself. Obviously she’s playing 
give-the-security-boys-a-hard-time. 
We’re used to stirring up a little re- 
sentment.” 

“If I may put in a word,” 
rumbled Falor Dample. “Miss 
Promton’s contribution to the pro- 
ject has not been a small one. With- 
out her, that Bauble we’re looking 
at might still be only on the draw- 
ing-board. That doesn’t strike me 
as something to expect from an 
enemy agent.” 

“In any event,” said Marvis, 
sounding impatient, “if the test 
which we might get around to after 
a while is a success, Monte can tell 
us very quickly if Rayeal Promton 
or anyone else on Narva is a Prim- 
granese infiltrator.” 

“Good point,” replied Dample. 
“Why don't we get on with it?" 

“Very well,” agreed Thydan. 
"Marvis, you'll alert Plackmon to 
keep Miss Promton confined?” 

“Taken care of.” 

"Good. Mr. Dample, as chair- 
man of Gordeen Consolidated, I 



believe the honor of pushing the [ 
button is yours.” 

And that, very suddenly, was it. 
The loss of her preferred escape 
route could not concern Gweanvin 
now. No tenseness over that or any- 
thing else. The task at hand re- 
quired totally relaxed attention. 

She entered fully into the Bauble 
for the first time. It felt different [ 
from Primgranese Baubles, partly 
because this one carried no idents 
of previous ego-field entrants, and 
partly because it was different on 
the physiochemical level. She felt an | 
instant of relief at finding no idents [ 
there. If somebody around the lab f 
had broken the rule forbidding 
entry in the Bauble she would now 
be open to telepathic contact with 
that person, and he could have 
blown the whistle on her. 

Immediately she turned her at- [ 
tention to the portion of the surface [ 
touching the interface. Glowing 
bright traceries filled her mind. 1 
Beau ti ful! But this was no time for L 
esthetic appreciation. What were ! 
the shapes of those traceries? What | 
made them? How did they func- { 
tion? 

And what did they remind her j 
of? Some natural structure . 

She allowed herself no awareness I 
of seconds passing. Taking time to 1 
observe that this was takitjg too 
long would have made it take even 
longer. 

When Thydan spoke, his voice 
came dimly to her. and its content 
made no impression: "Readings in- 



22 



dicate optimum operation. Now I'll 
comm Orrbaune to turn on their 
end.” 

Were the traceries like the opti- 
cal-synapse interface? The summa- 
tion of thousands of retinal cell 
messages into a coherent visual 
scene? ... No . Something 
else . 

Auditory! The complex intercon- 
nections of cilia nerves, involving 
feedbacks and resonances and a 
dozen other phenomena that en- 
abled a listener to distinguish subtle 
variations in pitch and quality of 
sound. That was it! . In part, 
and not exactly. 

Gweanvin kept at it until the 
whole picture clarified. She knew 
the nature of the interface and 
could guess from that the para- 
meters of the comm system behind 
it. She could break contact right 
now, sabotage the Bauble and head 
for home at the earliest opportun- 
ity. It would be easy enough to get a 
vacation after the test proved a 
"failure", and back in the Com- 
monality she could write out detail- 
ed instructions on how to build a 
Bauble-to-Bauble comm system . 

A nd that system wouldn’t work. 

That realization came almost 
intuitively from her grasp of the 
characteristics of the interface. It 
wouldn't work. 

Which wasn’t the same as saying 
it couldn't work. It could. An an- 
cient automobile with a defective 
starter could work, but wouldn’t —

until someone gave it a push to 
start it. The same was true of this 
system. There was near-complete 
randomity of orientation of the 
tiny, fine-texture fields of the inter- 
face traceries. This would prove ex- 
tremely resistant to any flow 
through the system, too resistant 
for a flow to move. 

But given the right kind of push, 
the fine-texture fields would align 
and resistance would vanish. 

What kind of push, though? And 
by what ... or whom? 

Gweanvin could not even guess 
at the answer to the first of these 
questions. But the answer to the 
second was obvious. 

She could not pull out of the 
Bauble yet, she realized. A vital 
question was still unanswered. She 
had to stay . perhaps until it was 
too late to pull out at all . 

She stayed. But at the same time 
she started her body through a pre- 
viously planned program of activi- 
ties that could be carried out with 
minimal mental supervision. Her 
hands twisted off the top of the 
light-pen and her fingers deftly 
plucked out the instrument's con- 
trol assembly and minipower unit. 
Next, the zercrown was brought out 
of the drawer, slid over the point of 
the light-pen, and taped in place. 

“Orrbaune's switching on im- 
mediately,” Thydan reported. 
Gweanvin kept her attention spread 
over the interface glow, watching 
for any change. 

Now her fingers were wiring the 



device with strands of superconduct 
equipped with ready-weld tips. The 
two loose ends were then attached 
to insulated probe- needles. 

The interface was beginning to 
alter in an area near its center. 
Something was happening there. 
Gweanvin moved in tightly on this 
area. Yes, it really was something 
like a push coming from the other 
side . 

Her hands had left the finished 
device on the console and had 
picked up the two sheets of war- 
prag. Her body had stood up and 
was walking toward the door. 

. and in a way the push re- 
sembled a magnetic field. It was 
swinging the fine-texture fields into 
consistent orientation. But how was 
it doing this, specifically? . 

Her fingers separated the two 
sheets of warprag, and her hands 
slapped the exposed active surfaces 
into position, overlapping the edge 
of the door and the door frame. 
Absently, like a well-rehearsed 
piano player with a wandering 
mind, she watched her hands press 
firmly against the sheets, imbed- 
ding their grip. Only a powerful 
smashing could force the door from 
the balcony side while those war- 
prags remained in place. 

. Ah! She was getting it! 
Monte was coming through! And 
for the instant he was too occupied 
opening up the interface to notice 
what lay beyond. Gweanvin watch- 
ed him work. She saw how it was 
done . 



24 



GALAXY 



Her body had returned to the 
console. Her hands picked up the 
probe-needle contacts of her device 
and plunged them through the 
flesh under her ribs on her right 
side, seeking and finding the ter- 
minals of her main power pack im- 
bedded there. 

. Anger! A flash of anger now 
and she would have the job finish- 
ed. But emotions, while controll- 
able, work more slowly than clean 
thought. The split-second required 
to work up a burst of rage was too 
long. Monte spotted her. Damn! 
Her rage flooded out in a quick 
spurt and was gone. And so. of 
course, was contact with Monte . 

46 CJ ECURITY break!" Thydan 
tjwas yelling. "It's Gweanyin 
Oster! 1 caught a thought from 
Monte! The Bauble's dark!" 

Gweanvin grinned as she pointed 
her device at the wall of her office 
opposite the door and activated it. 
A thin, superhot laser-beam flash- 
ed from the zercrown. cutting a 
curving slash in the wall as the de- 
vice kicked in her hand. For an in- 
stant her shield screen turned on 
automatically to protect her from 
the intense backflare. She had 
pulled out of the ruined Bauble, 
but was keeping a light contact 
with its sound-sensitive surface seg- 
ments which, not being destructible 
by emotional overload, were still 
functioning. 

"I'm going a/ier her!" came a 
grim bark from Marvis, as Gwean- 



vin re-aimed and made another 
curving cut through the wall. The 
curves came together at two points, 
and a two-foot-wide slice of metal- 
masc teetered for an instant and 
fell outward. 

Gweanvin had semi-inerted and 
slipped through the opening long 
before the chunk of wall reached 
the ground. She streaked upward 
from Narva as fast as atmospheric 
resistance against her shield screen 
would permit. 

"Alert the Guard!" came Thy- 
dan’s voice. “She’s out of the build- 
ing and getting away!” 

“What happened to the Bau- 
ble?” came the rumble of Falor 
Dample. 

“How should I know?” Thydan 
returned bitterly. “Among those 
major contributions of hers you 
were just praising was a twist she 
didn’t bother to tell you about! I’m 
trying to get a report relayed from 
Monte. Maybe he knows what hap- 
pened.” 

Gweanvin allowed herself si* 
seconds of unswerving upward 
flight before taking evasive action. 
She figured on that much leeway 
before the Guardsmen could mount 
an effective response to the alert at 
upper-atmospheric levels. Out in 
open space, which she was fast 
approaching, they could react 
quicker, but so could she. She kept 
her laser device ready for use. It 
was clumsily small as a hand wea- 
pon and wasteful of energy, so low 
in resistance as to act as a virtual

short-circuit across her power im- 
plant. It was no match for a zer- 
burst pistol, though it worked on 
the same principle. She hoped she 
could get away without using it 
again. 

“Monte says she knows how to 
work the interface!” cameThydan’s 
alarmed voice. “And she may be 
listening to us! Let’s get out of this 
room!” 

IV 

G weanvin pulled away from the 
Bauble completely. It wasn’t 
a good idea to enter warpflight with 
the ego-field lagging behind the 
body, anyway. 

She tongued her toothmike to 
her "father’s” frequency. "Hey, 
Pops!” 

“Hello. Rayeal,” the reply mur- 
mured in her left ear. 

“Cover’s blown. Pops. Out.” 
“Thanks, Gweanny. Out.” 

That warning would give her 
"family” members a chance to 
scram before Lontastan counter- 
espionage teams closed in on them. 
But she was the one the heat was 
really on. That report relayed from 
Monte to Thydan would make it 
plain that she had information she 
must not be allowed to carry to the 
Primgranese Commonality. The 
Guards had probably been ordered 
to shoot on sight . 

One of them did. Just as she was 
passing the forty-mile altitude level 
the Hare from his zerburst pistol 



sparked less than three miles to her 
left. She caught a quick glimpse of 
the ionized trail of the beam lead- 
ing to the flare. It hadn’t missed 
her by more than fifty feet and 
wouldn’t have missed at all if she 
hadn’t made an evasive zag less 
than a second earlier. 

She risked a mini-warp — dan- 
gerous in the atmospheric fringe — 
and came out of it seventy miles 
higher, with body and ego-field still 
together. Her detector immediately 
revealed half a dozen guardsmen 
within range. She had warped into 
the middle of a platoon! She 
quickly warped again, and came 
out to see a spectacular display of 
flares blossom around the spot she 
had just vacated. 

Nobody was close enough this 
time to get a good shot at her, but 
her detector showed the sky was 
now full of Guardsmen, above, be- 
low, and on all sides. This was a 
time to scoot, she decided, not to 
stand and fight. She would have to 
risk going into warp and staying 
there. 

She did so . and got away 
with it. No body/ego-field dissocia- 
tion that came when one warped 
through a too-dense wisp of gas or 
dust, wisps that were always drift- 
ing unpredictably about the near 
vicinity of stars. 

Now the sun of Narva was shrink- 
ing to a pin-point and she was 
safely through the gauntlet of 
Guardsmen — thanks to the fact 
that the alarm had not gone out 



26 



GALAXY 



until she had escaped from theGor- 
deen building and was on her way. 
Two seconds later and she would 
not have made it. 

She would be pursued, of course, 
and Guardsmen from other Lon- 
tastan worlds would be swarming 
out to try to intercept her. But in- 
terstellar space was vast, and she 
possessed less mass than any of the 
Guardsmen — neobarbs were all big 
men — and therefore had a higher 
sustainable warp velocity. She’d be 
hard to either catch or head off. 

Nevertheless, she knew she could 
not make it to the Commonality 
without help. The necessity of 
cutting her way out of the Gordeen 
building had made that impossible. 
Those two blasts from her make- 
shift laser knife, brief though they 
were, had drained an awesome 
amount of power from her pack. 
Those packs weren’t designed to be 
stingy; often a person in an emer- 
gency needed plenty of juice in a 
hurry, and a pack would supply 
current at the rate needed . 
while it had current to supply. 

But on a short-circuit discharge, 
and especially through supercon- 
ductwiring, an implant pack could 
be drained completely in ten sec- 
onds or less. Gweanvin's pack had 
not been fully charged to begin 
with, and had been on short-circuit 
for a good three seconds. It was, 
she guessed, at something less than 
half capacity now. 

And the Commonality was a long 
way off. Narva was located at the 



far side of the Lontastan Federa- 
tion, and that put her home ground 
some twenty thousand light-years 
away, with nothing but unfriendly 
territory in between. Perhaps she 
had power for two-thirds of that 
distance. 

There was, however, no point in 
heading in the other direction, into 
the unsettled region of the galaxy 
behind the Lontastan worlds. That 
region had been explored for quite 
some distance. There were planets 
on which she could play a female 
Robinson Crusoe for the rest of her 
life, but that was all. 

There was just one destination 
within reach that made any sense — 
the Halstaynian Independency. 

The Independency lay roughly 
between but somewhat to one side 
of both the Federation and the 
Commonality, and bulged on the 
Federation side in the general di- 
rection of Orrbaune. It was not a 
participant in the econo-war, hav- 
ing been settled by people who 
viewed competitiveness with dis- 
taste, as a childish and demeaning 
habit man should have given up 
long ago. 

Gweanvin shared the majority 
view of Halstaynians — that they 
were somewhat less than half alive 
and getting moreso every year. But 
when somebody from the Common- 
ality or Federation went intodhe In- 
dependency, which was not often, 
the Halstaynians were friendly 
enough — if in an absurdly con- 
descending manner. And from 



THE FRONTLINERS 



27 



there she certainly shouldn’t have 
any trouble getting her pack re- 
charged and returning to the Com- 
monality. 

The important point was that she 
had the power to reach the Inde- 
pendency. 

After a moment of consideration, 
she threw away her laser device. It 
was her only excuse for a weapon, 
but it was also mass, and if she 
made it out of Lontastan territory, 
she would do so by running, not by 
fighting. 

Next she considered her clothing, 
but her flimsy blouse and shorts 
really had too little mass to make 
discarding them worthwhile. The 
same was true of her sandals. As 
for her belt and pouch, they had 
mass but could not be parted with. 
She had to have something in which 
to keep her food pills, if nothing 
else. However, she went through 
the pouch and threw away every- 
thing in it she could possibly do 
without. 

After that she broke out of warp 
momentarily, got herself coordinat- 
ed on a star beyond which was an 
entry through the gas cloud banked 
on this side of the Independency, 
and returned to warpflight on the 
new course. 

Then there was nothing to do but 
relax into dormancy from pill-time 
to pill-time, for the several standard 
days the journey would take. And 
despite the all-out search the Lon- 
tastans were making, this routine 
went undisturbed. 



T he gas clouds that lay between 
the Halstayne Independency 
and Earth accounted for the Inde- 
pendency's existence. As humanity 
began spreading out among the 
stars, forming the colonial societies 
that eventually became the Prim- 
granese Commonality and the Lon- 
tastan Federation, the explorers 
moved along the edges of the clouds 
without attempting to penetrate. 
Much later, when gas-free passage- 
ways through the clouds were found 
and charted, neither the Common- 
ality nor the Federation saw much 
potential in the hard-to-reach 
handful of habitable worlds the 
clouds concealed. 

These worlds went more or less 
by default to the individuals and 
small groups who, for various rea- 
sons, wanted no part in the econo- 
war. Gweanvin had never felt much 
affinity any such drop-out philos- 
ophy; in fact, she had never visited 
the Independency before. But it 
was part of her job to know her way 
about the inhabited portion of the 
galaxy. She had learned the charts 
of the passageways through the 
clouds, and the locations and de- 
scriptions of the habitable worlds 
within. 

Also, she knew enough of the 
down-hill history of the Indepen- 
dency to have some idea of what to 
expect on those worlds. No more 
than a century ago, when fair num- 
bers of people were still moving ino 
the Independency, it was a fairly 
successful society. But of late the 



28 



GALAXY 



movement had been in the other di- 
rection. The more capable Halstay- 
nians were realizing that a society 
that forbade the competitive spirit 
was. in essence, a denial of the 
basic nature of man ... of life in 
general, for that matter. And being 
unrealistic, that kind of society had 
to either change or fall. 

The Halstaynians who could see 
this flaw for what it was usually 
found their personal solutions to it 
by immigrating to the Federation 
or Commonality, rather than stay- 
ing home and pushing revolutionary 
reform against an opposition com- 
posed principally of a formidable 
mass of public inertia. As a result, 
the Independency as a whole had 
rusticated. It no longer even tried 
to keep up technologically with the 
econo-warring societies. Whattech- 
nology it had once had was falling 
into disuse. The population was 
dwindling. 

All of which was all right with 
Gweanvin. If that was the way the 
Halstaynians wanted it, she mused, 
that was the way they could have it. 
All she asked was a simple recharge 
of her power pack — and surely that 
much technology was still left. 

She was more than halfway 
through the series of short, zig- 
zagging warps required to follow 
the charted passage through the 
cloud when she felt a warning 
twinge in her side. The power pack 
was advising her it was ninety per 
cent drained. She grunted. But at 
least she knew now precisely how 



much power she had left, and how 
stingy in its use she would have to 
be. 

No corner-cutting was advisable 
going through the passage, how- 
ever. When she came into view of 
the Halstaynian suns she calculated 
she had enough power left for one 
sizeable or two short jumps. 

Okay, which planet was it to be? 
Bernswa was reportedly the most 
advanced Halstaynian world but 
unless she had greatly underesti- 
mated her remaining power it was 
out of reach. And Felis, with a 
so-so reputation, was barely within 
range. The only world that could be 
called close was Arbora, which was 
so far gone that the Halstaynians 
had blithely designated it a wilder- 
ness preserve nearly fifty years ago. 

Gweanvin ate a food pill while 
she pondered the matter. This was 
a crucial decision. If she made the 
wrong choice, she could wind up 
stranded in space . and the Hal- 
staynians might not have a func- 
tioning space-rescue service these 
days. Or, if she went to Arbora, she 
could be stranded there, too, if 
there were no functioning power 
supplies. 

She needed more information be- 
fore deciding. She tuned her comm 
receiver to the open -broadcast 
channels and drifted in space for 
several hours while she listened at- 
tentively for a few useful facts. 
There was little to hear except 
music, most of it ancient, inter- 
spersed with trivial gab. But there 



THE FRONTLINERS 



29 



were a couple of mentions of per- 
sons on Arbora, which assured her 
that world wasn’t totally deserted. 

In any event, she decided it al- 
most had to be Arbora, because of 
the possibility that she was overesti- 
mating her remaining power. That 
could be the only world actually 
within reach. 

She was making the painstaking 
calculations needed for a precise 
warp when a bogie flicked into 
existence, a small glowing spot on 
the detection field surrounding her 
head. Whoever it was couldn’t have 
been more than a thousand miles 
away, she saw, suggesting that it 
was someone who had followed her 
through the cloud. 

A Lontastan agent on her tail? 
Very likely, indeed. 

Gweanvin had gone full inert 
while listening to her comm, to save 
a trickle of power. Thus, she would 
not be as visible to the bogie as the 
bogie was to her. In fact, she might 
easily be mistaken for a chunk of 
space debris, so long as she remain- 
ed inert. 

She played possum and watched. 
A couple of minutes passed, and 
the bogie flicked out, the person 
having warped off. But others 
might be following, so she continu- 
ed to watch. 

Nobody else appeared, which 
was a bit puzzling. Was that bogie 
a single Lontastan agent, playing a 
lone hand on a hunch? Well, if so, 
Gweanvin herself had a hunch who 
the agent would be. 



She had left clues enough behind 
to give somebody as sharp as Mar- 
vis Jans a clear hint of what might 
have happened. Marvis would know 
that she hadn’t blasted her way out 
of the Gordeen building with a zer- 
burst pistol, for the obvious reason 
that as a security measure hardly 
any such weapons were allowed in- 
side the building. Marvis would 
have accounted for those weapons 
quickly. Then she would have 
checked (if she hadn’t already) to 
be sure the building's energy out- 
lets were fused against short-circuit 
overdraws, also as a security mea- 
sure. 

And Marvis would therefore con- 
clude that the likelihood was very 
good that she had used her power 
pack implant, for lack of any other 
sufficient source, to blast through 
the wall. A little more checking 
would reveal how long it had been 
since Gweanvin had gotten a re- 
charge. Marvis could then guess 
she would have to head for the In- 
dependency as the only non-enemy 
territory within reach. 

But it would be a guess, not a 
sure thing. And it would be like 
Marvis — or like herself if their posi- 
tions were reversed — to play the 
guess on her own. 

Would Marvis investigate Arbora 
first? 

Perhaps. The agent’s movements 
were not predictable. She could see 
no percentage in delaying planetfall 
any longer. The sooner she was on 
the surface of a world, the sooner 



30 



GALAXY 



she could make herselt' impossible 
to find. 



S he warped for Arbora . and 
missed. Only by some two hun- 
dred thousand miles, but that was 
enough to require a mini-warp ap- 
proach jump. This brought her 
within five hundred miles of the 
surface. There she went full inert 
and let Arbora’s gravity bring her 
down, knowing she would be less 
j noticeable that way than in a semi- 
inert approach, and also would use 
! less energy. 

When she hit air her shield 
| screen reacted automatically, pro- 
tecting her from friction and heat, 
and spreading into a wing confor- 
mation to slow her fall and give her 
steerance. Not that it seemed to 
matter where she landed . all 
was field and forest below, with no 
indications of where the people 
might be. 

She angled toward a small grassy 
valley as she neared the surface, 
waiting until she was down to one 
hundred feet before trying to go 
semi-inert to soften the landing. 
Nothing happened when she did. 
She came down with a jarring 
thump, slowed only by ground- 
effect compression of the air be- 
tween her shield and the surface at 
the last instant. 

She rolled over and sat up in the 
long grass. Her shield was off, and 
her respiration had gone on normal 
exterior mode.

THE FRONTLINERS

Once more she tried to semi- 
inert. without result. Which could 
mean only that her power pack was 
totally drained. Just to be sure, she 
tried the shield screen again, and it 
did not respond. 

She was definitely on Arbora 
until she found a recharger, and 
she would do her searching for it on 
leg-power alone. 

But more urgent was the subject 
of food. The instant her breathing 
had gone external, bringing her the 
varied aromas of field and forest, 
she had become ravenous. She had 
been on the food-concentrate pills 
and stomach balloon for an uncom- 
fortably long flight, and needed 
something solid. 

She stood up and walked through 
the tall weeds to the small brook 
that gurgled through the valley, her 
eyes searching for anything edible. 
Arbora had. she recalled, a seeded 
Earth ecology — which obviously 
had turned out better than most 
other Halstaynian experiments. She 
recognized a number of briars and 
bushes that produced edible fruit in 
season, but the coolness of the air 
and the yellowish hues of the not- 
distant eaves of the forest told her 
this was not the season. It was 
autumn in this region of Arbora. 

At the brook she knelt and 
drank, and splashed her face with 
the clear sweet water. Standing, she 
considered following the brook 
downstream, but the thick growth 
of brambles and weeds would make 
difficult walking. Instead, she 



headed uphill toward the nearest 
trees. 

There her luck improved. Some 
of the trees were hickories, the 
ground beneath them liberally 
sprinkled with small nuts. She 
spent two hours smashing their 
tough hulls between two stones and 
picking out and eating their tiny 
but rich kernels. 

Then she moved on to a rocky 
bald on top of the hill. It was late 
afternoon by now and she scanned 
the horizon in all directions, 
searching for a wisp of smoke or 
any other sign of human presence. 

"Hev!" she yelled at the top of 
her voice. "Anybody home?" 

The startled birds in her vicinity 
obligingly ceased their chirping 
while she listened for a reply. 
Nothing. 

She turned around and yelled 
again with the same lack of results. 

So . start walking — or try to 
build a fire and some kind of 
shelter for the night. The low posi- 
tion of the sun made her choose the 
latter. 

Try to build a fire . .? 

The quickest way was to strike a 
spark between rock and metal into 
easily-lit tinder, but she had thrown 
away everything metallic when she 
cleaned out her pouch. She tried 
hitting rock on rock instead, but 
the stone thereabouts was wrong 
for the job. It crumbled instead of 
sparking. 

So . she would rub two sticks 
together, making a groove in one 



32 



GALAXY 



with the end of the other. 

She tried that for a vigorous forty 
minutes and was surprised when 
the groove finally began smoking. 
She dumped the spark into a hand- 
ful of cedarbark fiber she had 
gathered and fanned it into flame. 
A few minutes later she had a roar- 
ing fire going. 

For a while she sat beside her 
fire, resting her arms and rubbing 
the fatigue out of them as twilight 
deepened. Then she rose and began 
searching the nearby trees for pine 
and cedar boughtips to break off 
for bedding. That would be better 
than a mound of dry leaves, which 
were certain to be insect-infested. 

V 

T¥ EY ! Was that y° u yelling a 
H. while back?” a man’s voice 
called out of the gloom. 

Gweanvin turned, trying to see 
him. “Yeah ... 1 didn’t hear you 
answer." 

"I was stalking a deer at the 
time. Couldn't make noise," the 
man explained. His form moved 
closer to the fire, and she saw he 
was carrying something large over a 
shoulder which he heaved to the 
ground a moment later. "1 finally 
got within bowshot and brought her 
down. Then I started looking for 
you, and saw your fire.” 

He turned to look at her, and she 
could see his face dimly in the 
flickering light. He was clean- 
shaven, which she had not expected 



from a buckskin-clad man of the 
wilderness, and appeared to be in 
his thirties. 

“Looks like you’ve strayed a long 
way from home, young lady," he 
said. "You from Bernswa?” 

“Farther away than that. The 
Commonality," she replied. “My 
power pack’s exhausted. I had to 
land here to get a recharge.” 

‘‘A recharge on Arbora?” he 
laughed. “Well . probably you 
can, at that. There ought to be a 
few rechargcrs scattered about. 1 
don’t know for sure, though.” 

“You don’t know?” demanded 
Gweanvin. “Where do vow go for a 
recharge?” 

He chuckled. “The only thing 1 
recharge is my stomach. And I’m 
about ready to do that right now, if 
you’ll let that fire die down to a bed 
of coals fit to cook over. You 
hungry?” 

“I’m starving.” 

"More than plenty for both of 
us." He slid the large backpack off 
his shoulders and busied himself 
w ith knife and deer carcass. 

“Then you don’t have a life-sup- 
port system?” she asked. 

‘‘Just Arbora. No implants. I 
guess that sounds primitive to you, 
doesn’t it?" 

“It sounds restrictive,” she said 
diplomatically, not wanting to of- 
fend the source of her supper. 
"Doesn’t anyone on Arbora use im- 
plants?” 

“A few do. That’s why I say you 
might be able to get a recharge. 



THE FRONTLINERS 



33 



There's a settlement called High 
Pines about five days hiking west of 
here, and about eight days to the 
southeast is Lopat. You could 
almost call Lopat a town, 1 sup- 
pose." 

“What’s in between?” 

He shrugged and motioned 
vaguely at the surrounding woods. 
“Just this. Good hunting country. 
And not many hunters. 1 don’t 
average running into somebody 
three times a year out here.” 

Gweanvin considered this infor- 
mation. At last she said, “Then I’d 
better start walking for High Pines 
in the morning, if you’ll tell me the 
way." 

“Sure.” he agreed. “Or maybe 
you should head for Lopat. It’s a 
longer trip, but . well, I can’t 
say for sure which place is more 
likely to have a recharger, but I’d 
guess Lopat is.” 

There was a silence. Gweanvin 
was waiting for the man to offer 
some assistance in her search, per- 
haps hiking to Lopat while she went 
to High Pines. But he made no 
offer. Perhaps the primitive life 
deadened the chivalrous inclina- 
tions ... or perhaps he needed to 
know her better to exert himself in 
her behalf . 

“My name is Gweanvin. Gwean- 
ny. Gweanvin Oster.” 

“Glad to meet you, Gweanny. 
I'm Holm Ocanon.” 

“There are a lot of Ocanons in 
the Commonality,” she said. 

“That’s nice,” he said. Which 



was a conversation-stopper if ever 
she had heard one. 

W hen supper was ready they 
sat by the fire eating the 
broiled meat strips, roasted roots 
too fibrous to be potatoes but with 
a pleasant nutty flavor, and some 
kind of raw greenery Holm had had 
in his pack. Also he had brewed a 
bitter tea that was invigorating, 
and might have actually been tasty 
with a little sugar. 

"I have a blanket you can wrap 
yourself in,” he said. “As near 
naked as you are, you’ll sleep 
mighty cold without it.” 

"Thanks. It seems strange to 
need a blanket on a comfortable 
E-type planet, when ordinarily I’m 
perfectly comfortable just like this 
in interstellar space. It’s easy to 
take life-support for granted.” 

“1 imagine so,” he mused. “It’s 
easy to take living conditions of 
whatever kind for granted. And 
some conditions are less depend- 
able, less stable, than others.” 
“Yours seem stable enough, but 
awfully strenuous,” she said. 
“Wouldn’t life in or near one of the 
settlements be easier?” 

“Yes, and wouldn’t life in the 
Commonality be easier without the 
econo-war?” he returned. 

“Too much easier — as we found 
out a few decades ago when the war 
got too one-sided and almost end- 
ed." 

“Yes, that was after the Lontas- 
tans found the non-human telepath 



34 



GALAXY 



I they call Monte, and brought him 
| in on their side," Holm said. “We 
| heard about that. Then your side 
| developed the Bauble to even the 
I sides up again." 

“1 hardly expected to find an 
I econo-war fan here in the Arbora 
| wilderness," she said, smiling. 

“People are interested in other 
I people’s games ... to watch if not 
I to play,” he said musingly. 

“That's true,” Gweanvin replied. 
I "For instance. I’m interested in 
I your game, and why you choose to 
| play it. I would think the game of 
| family-raising near one of the 
| settlements would have more ap- 
| peal for an Arboran, and be plenty 
[ challenging." 

He nodded slowly. “I’d be play- 
! ing that game if I could.” 

"Why can’t you? A shortage of 
I women on Arbora?" 

“No. 1 could get the women all 
I right. 1 can’t get the children.” 

"You look like a thoroughly 
I functional male to me,” said 
[ Gweanvin. still hoping to recruit 
! Holm's aid with a bit of tlattery. 

He laughed. “I feel like one, es- 
I pecially with you sitting next to me. 
j But just the same. I’m out of 
[ whack, somehow. I don't repro- 
duce.” 

“Oh . That’s a problem 1 
know a bit about.” 

"Probably you don’t. It’s not 
simple sterility. We still have medi- 
cal treatment here, to take care of 
[ problems like that. No ... I seem 
i to be too different . .” 



Gweanvin started. “D-different? 
In what way?” 

"Well, if there was enough light 
for you to see my nose, you might 
notice a bony look, because — ” 

She slipped close to him. “Let 
me feel it,” she breathed. 

"Why . sure! Go ahead,” he 
laughed. 

Her fingers found his nose in the 
dark, and explored its ridge. Solid 
bone was underneath the skin! Just 
like her own nose! And Marvis 
Jans’! 

“Oh. golly! Wow! Oh, golly!” 

He laughed again. "My nose 
doesn’t usually get such a flattering 
reaction. What’s so thrilling about 
it?” 

“Your turn to feel my nose!" she 
giggled. As he did so she kept 
g>ggl' n g- “This beats everything! 
We search the files of the Com- 
monality and the Federation, cy- 
bernetically examine the genetic 
profiles of billions of people. Then I 
land on Arbora of all places, and 
who walks up to my tire first thing! 
Oh, Holm, this is a miracle! I've 
found you!" 

Holm sat without moving or 
speaking for a long moment, ap- 
parently stunned. Then he grunted, 
“Damned if you haven’t!” and took 
her in his arms. 

W hen Gweanvin woke the next 
morning Holm was gone, but 
his pack was still there. She found 
some live ambers in the ashes of the 
tire, and succeeded in blowing 



THE FRONTLINERS 



35 



some twigs into flame. Then she 
went down to the brook for an icy 
bath and was back at the fire warm- 
ing herself when Holm returned. 
He was carrying a roughwoven bag 
that Gweanvin hoped contained 
breakfast. 

“Hi,” she chirped. “Been hunt- 
ing?” 

“Yes,” he grinned, kissing her 
lightly. “More than hunting, really. 
1 left you shortly after midnight. 
Did 1 wake you?” 

“No." She had felt him leaving, 
but had not come fully awake. 

“1 wanted to check on a cabin 
that’s a couple of hours walk from 
here.” he explained. “I suppose it’s 
been deserted for a century but it’s 
in good condition. We can use it 
unless you want to be closer to a 
settlement.” 

He took utensils from, his pack, 
some large brown eggs from the 
sack he was carrying, began work- 
ing on breakfast. 

“Holm, 1 can’t stay,” Gweanvin 
said softly. 

He hesitated. “What's wrong?” 

“An obligation. My job in the 
econo-war. I’m a spy-saboteur for 
the Commonality. I have to go 
home to report on a matter that 
could be crucial to keep the war in 
balance. Somehow 1 have to get my 
power pack recharged, and do that. 
Then I can resign and come back." 

Holm put the teapot on the fire 
and began cutting fat into a frying 
pan. “How long will that take? A 
couple of months?” 



“More like three years I’m 
afraid. You see, the critical part of 
my report involves a technique that 
I’ve seen employed, and that I can 
do myself but can’t describe ver- 
bally. I’ll have to show others how 
it’s done, and some special equip- 
ment will have to be built before I 
can do the demonstration. That’s 
what will take time.” 

After a moment, Holm nodded. 
“Okay, Gweanny, I won’t give you 
any argument — except that I don’t 
want you giving birth to a child of 
mine in the Commonality.” 

"Don’t worry,” she giggled. “I’ll 
wait till I get back for that.” 

"And you can’t do anything until 
you're equipped to travel on foot 
through the forest,” he added. 
“You need a bow and training in 
how to use it to bring down game. 
You need warm clothing. We 
should stay here at the cabin for at 
least three days getting you pre- 
pared. Then you go to High Pines 
while I go to Lopat. That’s the 
fastest way we can find out if 
there’s a recharger at either settle- 
ment. We’ll meet back here. 
Okay?” 

“Fine. But there’s one thing you 
should know, Holm. I’m sure I was 
pursued into the Independency by 
at least one Lontastan agent.” 

He nodded. “Right. I’ll keep my 
mouth shut about you — but there’s 
probably nothing to worry about. 
The people here won’t cooperate 
with the Lontastans, of course. And 
Arbora would be the last planet 



36 



GALAXY 



I 



p your pursuers would expect you to 
l land. Even then, there are thou- 
[ sands of villages on Arbora, in all 
of which they would have to make 
inquiries. I’d say they don't stand a 
chance of finding you until after 
r you're recharged." 

“That’s good to know,” she said 
I gratefully. But what pleased her 
I most was his assumption that there 
I were several agents on her tail — not 
I just one female with a big bust and 
I bony nose. Above everything, she 
I could not allow' Marvis Jans and 
[ Holm Ocanon to find out about 
I each other. Thank goodness, the 
I likelihood of that was slight with 
I Holm out of communication this 
f way, playing his game of self-suf- 
| ficiency in the wilderness. 

But even Marvis Jans’ presence 
! in the Independency was in itself 
[ more of a risk than she was willing 
I to accept. She resolved that when 
[ she resumed her homeward journey 
I she would make sure Marvis pur- 
I sued her right out of the Indepen- 
! dency. 

T he three days at the cabin pass- 
ed swiftly and busily. She had 
much to learn before undertaking a 
| two-week trek alone . how to 
handle the bow' Holm made for her, 
| how to find edible vegetables in 
I field and forest, how to quickly 
build a shelter that would keep out 
I most of the rain. She was a good 
I student, however, and often asked 
[ questions that gave Holm pause. 
Perhaps, she mused, there was 

^ THE FRONTLINERS 



no such thing as a completely ex- 
pert woodsman. Holm, who had 
lived in the wild most of his adult 
life, seemingly had missed many 
points. 

He was often away from the 
cabin for stretches of ten or more 
hours, ranging far among the scat- 
tered derelict habitations in search 
of bits of equipment she would 
need. His finds included a good 
knife, a chunk of sound velveen 
fabric from which she made herself 
warm trousers and jacket, a few 
pots and pans, and a Hint and steel 
for firemaking. 

Then one clear morning they be- 
gan their separate journeys, she 
heading west and he southeast. She 
had a roughly sketched map Holm 
had made for a guide, showing the 
major landmarks on the way to 
High Pines with a line indicating 
the best route to follow. 

Even with that help, it was a 
tough trip. Gweanvin guessed it 
had been years since Holm had ac- 
tually traveled this particular 
course, because she kept coming up 
against impassable thickets and 
bogs that must have formed since 
then. 

What he had described as a five- 
day hike turned out to be seven. 
But at last she came to the settle- 
ment of High Pines — some two 
dozen houses in a loose cluster 
under the trees with a scattering of 
cultivated fields nearby. 

There she was welcomed with 
hospitality, a couple of good meals, 



37 



and a cozy bed for the night. 

But no recharger. 

Did they know if there was a re- 
charger in Lopat, or anywhere else 
nearby? 

No . they weren’t sure. Only 
seven of the villagers had life-sup- 
port implants, and didn’t use them 
much. The last person there to get 
a recharge had gone to the planet 
Bernswa for it — and that was seven- 
teen years back. 

The picture wasn't encouraging 
as she began the long hike back to 
the cabin. The chance of Holm 
finding a recharger in Lopat seem- 
ed slight indeed from what she had 
learned. 

Well, if that meant she was stuck 
here indefinitely, then the econo- 
war would just have to get along 
without her. Perhaps getting the 
new breed started would have more 
long-term significance anyway. 

And she could get home at some 
indefinite time in the future. A 
couple of oldsters in High Pines 
had told her that; when one of them 
died she would be welcome to sal- 
vage his partially-charged power 
implant from his corpse. 

Both of them werediscouragingly 
spray and healthy. She wondered 
how much use her report would be 
to the Commonality, if it didn’t 
arrive until twenty years from now. 

H olm was waiting for her when 
she reached the cabin. “Poor 
Gweanny," he murmured, taking 
her in his arms and kissing her. 



“You look exhausted." 

“1 can believe it. Did you . , 
have any luck?" 

“Yes, 1 brought a recharger back 
with me,” he replied, surprisingly. 
“It’s inside.” 

‘‘Wow! That’s a relief! From 
what 1 was told in High Pines, 1 
wondered if there was one this side 
of Bernswa!" 

“At least one,” he smiled, giving 
her a squeeze, “and you’ve got it." 

‘‘Golly! 1 don’t know how to 
thank you. Holm!” 

He grinned. “Maybe I’ll think of 
some way.” 

“1 get the impression you’re not 
as beat as I am,” she laughed. 

“1 shouldn’t be. 1 got back three 
days ago. Been taking it easy ever 
since.” 

"How did you manage that?” 

“1 was given a lift by a fellow in 
Lopat, the man who loaned me the 
recharger. He wanted to know 
where I was taking it, anyway, so he 
Hew out here with me riding on his 
back.” 

She thought about it for a 
moment. “Doesn’t that compro- 
mise the location of our little love- 
nest?” 

“Not really. 1 know that guy. He 
won't talk to any Lontastan agents 
about us.” 

"Had any agents been in Lopat?” 

“I don’t think so. Of course 1 
didn’t ask, but someone would 
have been likely to mention such 
unusual visitors.” 

Gweanvin nodded, and asked no 



38 



GALAXY 



further questions. Holm hadn’t 
been as discreet as she would have 
preferred, but then he wasn’t a 
frontliner, experienced at disclos- 
ing not one datum more than he 
wished to disclose. Considering his 
backwater background, so far away 
from the econo-war, he had done 
very well indeed. 

T hey entered the cabin and he 
brought the recharger out of a 
closet. It was a large clumsy device, 
in a plastic block. It weighed at 
least twenty pounds, typical of the 
comparatively unpolished technol- 
ogy of the Independency of a 
century ago. 

But it worked. It generated 
energy. Gweanvin punched its 
probe-needles through her skin to 
the contacts of her power pack — 
rather gingerly because the needles 
were painfully dull — and thirty 
minutes later she had her recharge. 

“When are you leaving?” Holm 
asked. 

"Soon . tomorrow morning. I 
really must. Holm." 

“Okay. I’ll hate to see you 
go — but you know that.” 
"Returning will be more pleasure 
for me than leaving," she said. 
"And Holm, I don’t want you to see 
me go. 1 would be best if you were 
far away from the cabin before I go 
on power." 

"Oh ... in case the Lontastans 
spot you leaving and follow your 
backtrail?" 

“Yes. My light weight makes it 



possible for me to outwarp any 
agent I ever met, so the chances of 
my being caught are slight. But 
there’s nothing to stop the agents 
from coming here and questioning 
you." 

He laughed. “A lot I’d tell 
them!" 

“You could wind up telling them 
more than you intended,” she said 
grimly. “You know no more of 
their tricky games than I knew of 
woodsmanship — and if they find 
out I’m coming back . well, you 
can kiss our plans for a long and 
happy mating season goodbye.” 

After a moment, he said slowly, 
“I’ll leave around midnight, 
Gweanny, just as I did the first 
night. When you go. I’ll be more 
than twenty miles away.” 

H e was gone the next morning. 

Gweanvin prepared a large 
breakfast and ate it slowly. She was 
in no hurry to lift off, since each 
moment of delay now would put 
Holm farther away. Of course it 
was not really likely that she would 
be backtracked, but she did not 
want to take even a slight risk of 
bringing Holm and Marvis to- 
gether. 

She was not, she realized, being 
completely reasonable on that 
score. But neither would Marvis be, 
if their roles were reversed. Had she 
and Marvis been devoted sisters, 
perhaps they would willingly share 
the only available male of their 
species. But they were not. The ex- 



THE FRONTLINERS 



39 



pediencies of the econo-war could 
not be left out of the picture. She 
and Marvis were competitors, and 
frontline-competitors at that, which 
meant they were among the rela- 
tively small group of econo-warriors 
who might, on occasion, carry the 
conflict to the point of shooting at 
each other. 

Sharing the available male would 
be reasonable. It would be the 
surest way to give their new species 
a toehold on continued existence. 
But circumstances did not really 
allow her to be reasonable . 

. .Not even if she wanted to, 
which she didn’t. She grinned. It 
was such fun to outdo Marvis of the 
big bust! 

Not that Holm was . well, was 
her ideal. Gosh, he was close to 
sixty Standard Years, old enough 
to be her father! Even though, by 
the homo sap norm, he only looked 
thirty. Of course he doted on her; 
he made that all too obvious. 
Letting her have her way about 
everything, instead of forcefully 
taking charge. For instance, letting 
her leave for three years, or maybe 
even longer, without the least 
ruckus, although he plainly hated 
the idea. 

Oh, well. It was too much to ex- 
pect the one available male would 
be someone she could fall madly in 
love with. At least she found him 
attractive enough for all practical 
purposes. And he would make a 
terrific father, here on Arbora. She 
had sized his woodsmanship up 



wrong earlier, because he had 
trouble teaching it to her. But that 
was because he hadn’t ever bother- 
ed to verbalize a lot of what he 
knew before. 

The things that man could do . 
the success he had had scrounging 
equipment for her trek to High 
Pines . and that bow he had 
made for her, as good or better 
than any wooden bow that could be 
bought in a Primgran sporting 
goods shop . and these lovely 
breakfast eggs she was eating. De- 
spite his instructions, she hadn’t 
yet been able to find a wild chicken 
nest, but when Holm went egg- 
gathering he always came back 
with a sack of beauties. 

And if he was lacking somewhat 
in youthfulness and forcefulness, 
he was nevertheless plenty mascu- 
line. And with him sex could have a 
purpose beyond play. She suspected 
that difference alone would here- 
after make dalliance with homo sap 
males too trivial to bother with. 

What was that quote she had 
noticed in that ancient treatise on 
the experimental crossing of don- 
keys and horses to produce mules? 
Oh, yes: 

”... it is a curious fact that 
once a male donkey has served a 
female donkey, it is often reluctant 
to transfer its attentions to a female 
horse. " 

A "curious” fact, indeed. Seem- 
ingly even donkeys have an intuitive 
preference for producing a viable 
strain of offspring .

S he rose from the table and pre- 
pared to leave. That consisted 
mainly of removing the warm vel- 
veen clothing which would no longer 
be needed when she went on power. 
She walked through the cabin and 
paused, looking at the bow Holm 
had made her. It was a handsome 
piece of work, and she was tempted 
to take it and a few arrows along as 
mementos. 

Well, why not? If Marvis Jans 
were still around, she wanted to 
lead her away, didn’t she? The 
extra mass of the bow ought to slow 
her just enough to keep Marvis 
from growing quickly discouraged. 

She slung it across her shoulder 
and tied the quiver of six arrows to 
her belt. 

Gweanvin stepped outside, took 
I a final glance around, then semi- 
inerted and activated her propul- 
; sion field. Rapidly she soared up 
; into the clear morning sky, lifting 
; directly away from the planet, en- 
: joying the physical comfort of 
having all her life-support systems 
going again and the freedom of 
motion which could come no other 
' way. 

Her detectors showed a spot of 
; activity off to the southeast ... the 
settlement of Lopat, she guessed. 
Nothing showed at High Pines; 
none of the few possessors of Iife- 
: support systems there were using 
them at the moment. 

There were no signs of pursuit 



yet. She had not expected anything 
this quickly. Marvis might well 
have stationed herself near Arbora 
by this time, working on the as- 
sumption that if Gweanvin were 
still in the Independency at all, it 
was because she was on a planet 
where a recharge was hard to find. 
In short, on Arbora. But Marvis 
wouldn't be on the ground. She 
would be in space, ready to pounce 
on Gweanvin when she emerged 
from the atmosphere. 

Gweanvin hoped she would be 
waiting for her. That would save 
the trouble of buzzing every planet 
in the Independency looking for 
her. 

Soon she had cleared the atmos- 
phere. and immediately went into 
warp toward an opening in the gas 
clouds that led into the Common- 
ality. Within two minutes she was 
sure Marvis had not picked her up. 

She frowned in thought. Was 
it really worthwhile to search the 
Independency for Marvis, when the 
Lontastan agent might even have 
given up the chase by now and re- 
turned home? Or, if not that, 
might be waiting in ambush at one 
of the warpshift points in the cloud 
crevice ahead? 

It would not, she decided. If 
Marvis wasn't hanging around Ar- 
bora itself, what chance was there 
that she would encounter someone 
who would say. “Hey, I know a guy 
with a nose just like yours”? 
Almost no chance at all. 

So the only real risk was that 



THE FRONTLINERS 



41 



Marvis was near Arbora, but 
Gweanvin’s quick departure had 
caught her napping. Or perhaps 
the planet had been between them 
and had blocked out detection. 

Well, that possibility could be 
checked out quickly. 

Gweanvin reversed warp and 
went back to the Arbora system, 
overshooting the planet some thirty 
thousand miles. She had departed 
from the early-morning side, and 
now she hung over the early-evening 
side, studying her detector-screen. 

Nobody was on power anywhere 
in nearby space. The only flickers 
came from the planet itself, and not 
many of those. Only one of those 
flickers was dopplering, indicating 
a person moving upward through 
the atmosphere. Marvis Jans? 
Hardly likely. 

Gweanvin hesitated. Was there 
anything else to do before heading 
home? Well . not really. There 
came a time when the best thing to 
do was leave well enough alone 
and — 

The dopplering spot on her 
screen flicked off, and Marvis Jans 
emerged from miniwarp less than 
fifty yards away. Before Gweanvin 
had time to react, the Lontastan 
fired her zerburst pistol. 



an intense pain lanced through 
Gweanvin’s left hip. She warp- 
ed hurriedly, and the purring voice 
of Marvis came through the comm 
receiver in her left ear. 



“Dear little Gweanny! Did I give 
you a nasty old hole in the hip? I'll 
try to do better next time!” 

Gweanvin was busy shifting warp 
vectors, paying no heed to the 
diminishing pain in her hip. The 
maintenance units of her life-sup- 
port system were already at work on 
the wound. Localized intensity of 
her countervac pressor screen had 
halted the bleeding almost as soon 
as it began, and within seconds 
internal reagents were forming 
walls of pseudo-tissues to contain 
organ ruptures for the hour or so 
that would pass before normal 
healing processes could replace 
them. 

If, of course, she lived that long. 

The zerburst beam had passed 
too close to her transport packet 
implant. The device itself had not 
been hit, but from the way it was 
malfunctioning she knew it had 
been heavily ionized. That was a 
self-correcting problem . given 
time. But for the present she was 
warping with the speed of a three- 
hundred pounder, and her mini- 
warps were breaking short of her 
projected exit points. 

She couldn’t outrun Marvis in 
this condition! 

“I’m really sorry this has to be 
curtains for you. Gweanny,” came 
the older woman’s voice. “If I had a 
suitable alternative — but I don’t. 
You're just too tricky to take 
chances with, dear. So . happy 
re-embodiment.” 

Gweanvin guessed Marvis’ re- 



42 



GALAXY 



grets were sincere. Even frontliners 
hated to kill without ample reason. 
And Marvis knew she would be de- 
stroying half the female population 
of her own species. But Gweanvin 
could see her point. A Primgranese 
agent who had gained such vital in- 
formation as she about Lontastan 
plans for expanding Monte's sphere 
of dominance could not be allowed 
to return home. 

She continued miniwarping fran- 
tically. knowing Marvis would catch 
up with her quickly during any 
warp of more than a few second’s 
duration. They were still in the sys- 
tem of Arbora, zig-zagging out- 
ward toward a type-J gas giant. 

The failure of Marvis to kill her 
with that first shot was not due to 
lack of deadly intent. It came in- 
stead from Marvis having to warp 
in close enough to identify her 
quarry by sight, much too close for 
a zerburst flare. A zerburst pistol 
emitted a thin pencil of extremely 
intense light, so intense as to drill a 
hole through almost any substance 
it struck. Its intensity also created a 
linear warp along its length, result- 
ing in trailing portions of the beam 
propagating more rapidly than the 
leading portions. When the back 
end caught up with the front, and 
the beam had theoretically no 
length at all. it became an unsus- 
tainable singularity that broke up 
in an instantaneous release of all its 
concentrated energy. That was the 
flare. 

The more intense the beam, the 



quicker and closer the flare would 
be. But a pistol could not be so 
powerful as to produce a flare only 
a few yards from its muzzle, and in 
any event such a flare would vapo- 
rize the shooter as well as the tar- 
get. So the worst Marvis could do to 
Gweanvin at recognition distance 
was drill a quarter-inch hole 
through her, without time to aim 
and make that hole deadly before 
Gweanvin reacted and warped 
away. 

But now that the chase was on, 
the pistol would be more in the 
situation for which it was intended. 
Marvis could set the weapon’s in- 
tensity to flare at a certain range, 
then bide her time until she 
maneuvered herself to precisely 
that distance from Gweanvin. 

Perhaps, thought Gweanvin, if 1 
can circle behind that gas giant I 
can lose her long enough to — 

But again she dropped out of 
miniwarp too quickly. The condi- 
tion of her transport packet wasn't 
improving. She caught a flashing 
glimpse of a large object off to her 
left and with no hesitation warped 
to put it between herself and her 
pursuer. 

This time she had allowed prop- 
erly for her malfunctioning im- 
plant. Her warp exit was less than 
half a mile above the surface of the 
object, one of the gas giant’s airless 
minor moons. Immediately she 
went full inert, killing all power 
consumption except for pressor 
field and detector. An instant later 



THE FRONTLINERS 



43 



the detector screen showed the spot 
that was Marvis flash quickly on 
and off several hundred miles up as 
the Lontastan agent jumped around 
searching for her. Gweanvin, under 
the gravitational attraction of the 
moonlet. drifted slowly to the 
ground. 

“Very bright of you, Gweanny, 
dear,” came the voice of Marvis. 
"Taking cover could add whole 
minutes to your life-expectancy.” 

Which was accurate enough, 
Gweanvin supposed as she touched 
ground feet first with an experi- 
enced knee-jiggle to prevent bounc- 
ing. All Marvis had to do was close 
itv on the surface to a range where 
Gweanvin would be detectable, de- 
spite low-power usage, and circle 
on semi-inert until she spotted her 
target. 

Gweanvin looked around for 
shelter, but saw no good hiding- 
place, no hole to crawl into. A 
rill-cliff, its top in sunlight and its 
base in deep shadow, was the best 
cover she could find. A few long 
leaps brought her into the shadow 
where she stood, back to the cliff, 
watching her detection screen. 

A hell of a way to be caught, 
weaponless and with a loused-up 
transport implant, she told herself 
bitterly. 

Weaponless? 



S he swung her bow off her shoul- 
der and gave the string a testing 
tug. Surprisingly, the wood re- 



sponded normally, as if it had been 
treated in the manner of profes- 
sionally-made bows against deterio- 
ration in vacuum. She wondered 
fleetingly how Holm had come to 
anti-space the wood, but this was a 
bit of luck too good to question. 

She fitted an arrow to the bow 
and held the weapon ready, making 
sure that more arrows were poking 
handily out of the quiver for quick 
drawing. 

A ludicrous situation . pitting 
a bow against a zerburst pistol. She 
snickered grimly at the thought. 
Why, Marvis could fire, miniwarp, 
and fire again while a single arrow 
was crawling its way toward her 
original position! 

But if she could score a hit, the 
arrow would penetrate the agent’s 
defensive screen. Though an arrow 
was light in weight, it still packed a 
lot of mass in relation to the size of 
its penetrating tip. More than a 
bullet did, or many other far more 
sophisticated projectiles that defen- 
sive screens were designed to stop. 
Its relatively low speed in effect 
would “fool” the screens into treat- 
ing it as a minor threat, since the 
screen could not see all that inert 
mass behind it. 

However, the only possible ad- 
vantage she could expect from an 
on-target arrow was one of sur- 
prise, in that Marvis would not 
expect her to have any weapon at 
all . 

And there was Marvis! She came 
into view and into detection at the 



44 



GALAXY 



same time, flying slowly over the 
top of the cliff and not far to 
Gweanvin’s left. 

Gweanvin raised the bow, draw- 
ing back the string, and released. 
Without waiting to see the results, 
L and while Marvis spotted her and 
aimed her zerburst pistol, Gwean- 
vin miniwarped right up from the 
surface to a point fifty feet above 
her enemy. There she went on inert 
propulsion and drove straight down 
at Marvis. There was a slight jar 
when her shield screen banged into 
that of the semi-inert Lontastan, 
and a bruising jar when her impetus 
slammed both of them down on the 
rocky moonlet, with Marvis on the 
bottom. A shield screen had to flex 
under such punishment. 



VII 

G weanvin sat up groggily on 
the spot she had bounced to, 
ten feet from where Marvis was 
stretched out. Where was the 
pistol? Oh, there it was, beyond 
Marvis. She leaped across the 
woman and grapped it just as 
Marvis began to stir. 

Gweanvin tucked the pistol in 
her belt and watched the Lontastan 
warily. How knocked out was she? 
Badly hurt or playing possum? 

Although she had no intention of 
aiding her traumatized enemy, 
Gweanvin exteriorized and moved 
into the woman to check on her in- 
juries. That was something an ego- 



field could do far better than physi- 
cal hands, because the care of 
bodies was a prime ego-field skill, 
and . 

Stunned, Gweanvin withdrew 
and stood staring at the older 
woman. 

Marvis was not badly mangled. 
A couple of broken ribs, a little 
internal bleeding, and an arrow 
through the left shoulder. Nothing 
her life-support maintenance sys- 
tem could not mend in a few hours, 
once that arrow was out of the way. 
After a moment, Gweanvin stepped 
forward and gently pulled the 
arrow free. 

Oh. yes. Marvis would be fine. 
And so would her baby. 

Pregnant! 

By about two weeks, as near as 
Gweanvin could guess. 

Oh, my, what a fine country 
bumpkin Holm Ocanon had turned 
out to be! 

“Marvis,” she said. 

The woman roused slightly. “Uh- 
huh.” 

“You’ll be okay in a little while. I 
removed the arrow. I’d better run 
along now.” 

Marvis managed to open her eyes 
and stare questioningly up at her. 
“Where are you going?” 

“To the Commonality, naturally. 

1 have a report to make, in case 
you've forgotten.” 

“Uh. See you again?” 

"Not if I can help it. So long.” 

Gweanvin lifted off. She decided 
not to bother retrieving the bow she 



THE FRONTLINERS 



45 



had left back by the rill-cliff. But 
before warping out of the Arbora 
system, she paused in thought. De- 
spite what the pregnancy of Marvis 
told her, the point remained that 
she had promised to return in 
about three years . 

She tongued her toothmike to 
nonspecific frequency and called, 
"Holm Ocanon?” 

Silence. 

"Speak up, Holm,” she snapped. 
“I’ve caught on.” 

"Hi, Gweanny," his voice sound- 
ed in her left ear. “I’m sorry.” 

“I'll just bet you are!” she scold- 
ed, narrowing down to his comm 
frequency. “Quite a set-up you ar- 
ranged for yourself. Not that I 
really blame you of course. Males 
of our species probably have polyg- 
amous instincts, just like homo 
sap, I suppose. Too bad for you 
your scheme didn’t work. Wow, 
how you had it made!” 

"Uh . how’s Marvis?” 

“Oh, don’t fret! She’s out cold at 
the moment, but she’ll come limp- 
ing back in a few hours.” 

"Does she know as much as you 
do?” 

“Not from anything I said. But 
you won’t gain anything from your 
masquerade now. Holm, so why not 
be honest with her?” 

"Maybe I should,” he replied 
glumly. "How did you catch on?" 

“From her being pregnant. How 
stupid I was, admiring your woods- 
manship! Wild chicken nests, in- 
deed! What farmer did you buy 



those eggs from. Holm? Did you 
pick up that bow at a sporting- 
goods shop in Lopat, or did you 
have to hop on semi-inert to a 
bigger town to find it? Maybe a 
town halfway around the planet 
from where I was stuck, but close to 
the nest you shared with Marvis? 
Did you have to go all the way to 
Bernswa to pick up that recharger? 
Damn! No wonder that map you 
drew had me mired in bogs and 
scratched in briar thickets! The 
least you could have done was to 
survey it at a lower altitude!" 

“Gweanny, I set things up like 
this because I'd given it years of 
thought, along with a lot of patient 
waiting for the right opportunity. 
Try to understand, won’t you?” he 
urged. "We’re a new species, too 
new to know what we really are, or 
even have a name for ourselves. We 
and our children should develop as 
much as possible on our own, not 
as members of the econo-war so- 
ciety of humanity. We should find 
our own paths and goals, Gweanny, 
as we can on a world like Arbora. 
Don’t you see the reasonableness of 
that?” 

"I decided earlier today not to be 
reasonable," she replied. “In any 
event, I don’t see the reasonable- 
ness of starting our species off with 
personal relationships based on de- 
ception. Damn it. Holm, I wouldn't 
treat anybody but a Lontastan in 
the tricky, scheming way you’ve 
handled Marvis and me! I 
wouldn’t . 



46 



GALAXY 



S he paused as another light 
dawned on her. "But of course, 
you’d be good at things like that, as 
a former front liner! Were you 
Primgran or Lontastan?” 
“Primgran," he grunted. 

“I’ll be interested in looking up 
your personnel file, when I get 
home,” she mused. “I want to see 
how you doctored your genetic 
chart to conceal yourself. And how 
you managed to keep tabs on 
Marvis and me, without us ever 
dreaming you existed! Very clever- 
ly, I’m sure. You had to be bright 
indeed to anticipate by several 
hours that she and I might come to 
Arbora, so you could be on hand 
to welcome us separately. Well, so 
long. Holm. Fess up to Marvis, and 
have plenty of kids." 

“You’ll be back, Gweanny,” he 
told her. 

“Don’t count on it.” 

“It pleases you now to be unrea- 
sonable, but in the long run you 
won't be unrealistic." He chuckled. 
“And the reality is that I’m the only 
available male.” 

"Don’t count on that, either. 
You concealed yourself. Maybe 
another is somewhere around, do- 
ing the same. Not likely, maybe, 
but even so I’d prefer to spend my 
whole life waiting for him rather 
than be your second-stringer.” 

“I don’t understand you," he 
complained. 

“My unreasonableness. If you 
understood that, you would have 
anticipated my unreasonable de- 



cision to decoy Marvis away from 
Arbora when I left. If I hadn’t tried 
that, I wouldn’t have gotten wise to 
you." 

“Well,” he said confidently, 
“jealousy on your part was hardly 
expected. And, of course, feeling 
that way, you’ll surely return.” 

“Meaning I love you?” she sneer- 
ed. “Hah! If I did, do you think I’d 
fret over competition from Marvis? 
I’d just blow a hole through her! I 
was trying to prevent a competition 
I didn't care about enough to win! 
Love you? Hell, Holm, I don’t even 
like you!” 

With that she vyarped for home. 
She had meant what she said, but, 
golly, how she was going to need a 
male when she reached Marvis’s 
age! 

H ours later, and far from Ar- 
bora, a voice piped in her left 
ear: “Nice going, Gweanvin Oster.” 
“Huh? Who’s that?” 

No response. 

Who could it have been? It had 
sounded like the voice of a boy, 
perhaps twelve years old. But what 
would a kid be doing way out here, 
and how could he have known of 
her? 

She guessed the answers, of 
course, long before she knew them 
for sure nearly a decade later. By 
then the boyish voice had deepened 
and matured. 

Gweanvin never returned to Ar- 
bora. Her children did. *

but a Perfect cigar . 

BOB SHAW 

I t was a trivial thing — a ciga- than an hour. She had said very 
rette lighter — which finally little during that time, but every 
wrecked Philip Connor’s peace of word, every impatient gesture of 
mind. her slim hands, had conveyed the 

Angela and he had been sitting message that it was all over between 
at the edge of her pool for more them. 



48 



Connor was sitting upright on a 
canvas chair, manifestly ill at ease, 
trying to understand what had 
brought about the change in their 
relationship. He studied Angela 
carefully, but her face was rendered 
inscrutable, inhuman, by the huge 
insect eyes of her sunglasses. His 
gaze strayed to a lone white butter- 
fly as it made a hazardous flight 
across the pool and passed, twink- 
ling like a star, into the shade of the 
birches. 

He touched his forehead and 
found it buttery with sweat. “This 
heat is murderous.” 

“If suits me,” Angela said, an- 
other reminder that they were no 
longer as one. She moved slightly 
on the lounger, altering the brown 
curvatures of her semi-nakedness, 

Connor stared nostalgically at 
the miniature landscape of flesh, 
the territory from which he was 
being evicted, and reviewed the 
situation. The death of an uncle 
had made Angela rich, very rich, 
but he was unable to accept that as 
sufficient reason for her change in 
attitude. His own business interests 
brought him more than two-hun- 
dred thousand a year, so she knew 
he wasn’t a fortune hunter. 

“1 have an appointment in a little 
while," Angela said with a patently 
insincere little smile. 

Connor decided to try making 
her feel guilty. “You want me to 
leave?” 

He was rewarded by a look of 
concern, but it was quickly gone. 



leaving the beautiful face as calm 
and immobile as before. 

Angela sat up, took a cigarette 
from a pack on the low table, 
opened her purse and brought out 
the gold cigarette lighter. It slipped 
from her fingers, whirred across the 
tiles and went into the shallow end 
of the pool. With a little cry of 
concern she reached down into the 
water and retrieved the lighter, 
wetting her face and tawny hair in 
the process. She clicked the 
dripping lighter once and it lit. 
Angela gave Connor a strangely 
wary glance, dropped the lighter 
back into her purse and stood up. 

“I’m sorry, Phil," she said. “I 
have to go now." 

It was an abrupt dismissal but 
Connor, emotionally bruised as he 
was, scarcely noticed. He was a 
gypsy entrepreneur, a wheeler-deal- 
er, one of the very best — and his 
professional instincts were aroused. 
The lighter had ignited first time 
while soaking wet, which meant it 
was the best he had ever seen, and 
yet its superb styling was unfamiliar 
to him. This fact bothered Connor. 
It was his business to know all there 
was to know about the world’s 
supply of sleek, shiny, expensive 
goodies, and obviously he had let 
something important slip through 
his net. 

“All right, Angie.” He got to his 
feet. “That’s a nice lighter — mind 
if I have a look?” 

She clutched her purse as though 
he had moved to snatch it. “Why 



49 



don’t you leave me alone? Go away, 
Phil." She turned and strode off 
toward the house. 

"I’ll stop by for a while to- 
morrow.” 

“Do that,” she called without 
looking back. “I won’t be here.” 

Connor walked back to his Lin- 
coln, lowered himself gingerly onto 
the baking upholstery and drove 
into Long Beach. It was late in the 
afternoon but he went back to his 
office and began telephoning 
various trade contacts, making sure 
they too were unaware of something 
new and radical in cigarette 
lighters. Both his secretary and 
telephonist were on vacation so he 
did all the work himself. The activ- 
ity helped to ease the throbbing 
hurt of having lost Angela, and — in 
a way he was unable to explain — 
gave him a comforting sense that he 
was doing something toward getting 
her back or at least finding out 
what had gone wrong between 
them. 

He had an illogical conviction 
that the little gold artifact was 
somehow connected with their 
breaking up. The idea was utterly 
ridiculous, of course, but in think- 
ing back over the interlude by the 
pool with Angela it struck him that, 
amazingly for her, she had gone 
without smoking. Although it prob- 
ably meant she was cutting down, 
another possibility was that she had 
not wanted to produce the lighter in 
his presence. 

Realizing his inquiries were 



getting him nowhere, he closed up 
the office and drove across town to 
his apartment. The evening was 
well advanced yet seemingly hotter 
than ever — the sun had descended 
to a vantage point from which it 
could attack more efficiently, slant- 
ing its rays through the car win- 
dows. He let himself into his apart- 
ment, showered, changed his 
clothes and prowled unhappily 
through the spacious rooms wish- 
ing Angela was with him. A lack of 
appetite robbed him of even the sol- 
ace of food. At midnight he brewed 
coffee with his most expensive 
Kenyan blend, deriving a spare sat- 
isfaction from the aroma, but took 
only a few disappointed sips. If 
oitlv. he thought for the thousandth 
time, they could make it taste the 
wav it smells. 

He went to bed, consciously 
lonely, yearned for Angela until he 
fell asleep. 

N ext morning Connor awoke 
feeling hungry and, while eat- 
ing a substantial breakfast, was re- 
lieved to find he had regained his 
usual buoyant outlook on life. It 
was perfectly natural for Angela to 
be affected by the sudden change in 
her circumstances, but when the 
novelty of being rich, instead of 
merely well off, had faded he would 
win her back. And in the mean- 
while he — the man who had been 
first in the country with Japanese 
liquid display watches — was not 
going to give up on a simple thing

like a new type of cigarette lighter. 

Deciding against going to his 
office, he got on the phone and set 
up further chains of business in- 
; quiries, spreading his net as far as 
[ Europe and the Far East. By mid- 
morning the urge to see Angela 
i again had become very strong. He 
' ordered his car to be brought round 
to the main entrance of the build- 
ing and he drove south on the coast 
| road to Asbury Park. It looked like 
being another day of unrelieved 
sunshine, but a fresh breeze from 
i the Atlantic was fluttering in the 
!■ car windows and further elevating 
his spirits. 

When he got to Angela’s house 
there was an unfamiliar car in the 
l U-shaped driveway. A middle-aged 
man wearing a tan suit and steel- 
rimmed glasses was on the steps, 

? ostentatiously locking the front 
door. Connor parked close to the 
steps and got out. 

The stranger turned to face him, 
jingling a set of keys. "Can I help 
you?" 

“I don’t think so,” Connor said, 
resenting the unexpected presence. 
“1 called to see Miss Lomond.” 

"Was it a business matter? I’m 
Millett of Millett and Fiesler." 

“No — I’m a friend.” Connor 
moved impatiently toward the door- 
bell. 

“Then you should know Miss Lo- 
mond doesn’t live here any more. 

; The house is going up for sale." 

Connor froze, remembering An- 
gela had said she wouldn’t be 



around, and shocked that she had 
not told him about selling out. 
“She did tell me, but I hadn’t 
realized she was leaving so soon,” 
he improvised. “When’s her furni- 
ture being collected?” 

“It isn’t. The property is being 
sold fully furnished.” 

“She’s taking nothing?" 

“Not a stick. I guess Miss Lo- 
mond can afford new furniture 
without too much difficulty,” 
Millett said drily, walking toward 
his car. “Good morning.” 

“Wait a minute.” Connor ran 
down the steps. “Where can I get in 
touch with Angela?” 

Millett ran a speculative eye over 
Connor’s car and clothing before he 
answered. “Miss Lomond has 
bought Avalon — but I don’t know 
if she has moved in yet.” 

“Avalon? You mean . .?’’ Lost 
for words, Connor pointed south in 
the direction of Point Pleasant. 

“That’s right.” Millett nodded 
and drove away. Connor got into 
his own car, lit his pipe and tried to 
enjoy a smoke while he absorbed 
the impact of what he had heard. 
Angela and he had never discussed 
finance — she simply had no interest 
in the subject — and it was only 
through oblique references that he 
had guesstimated the size of her in- 
heritance as in the region of a 
million, perhaps two. But Avalon 
was a rich man’s folly in the old 
Randolph Hearst tradition. Sur- 
rounded by a dozen square miles of 
the choicest land in Philadelphia, it

was the nearest thing to a royal 
palace that existed outside Europe. 

Real estate was not one of 
Connor’s specialties, but he knew 
that anybody buying Avalon would 
have had to open the bidding at ten 
million or more. In other words, 
Angela was not merely rich — she 
had graduated into the millionaires’ 
superleague, and it was hardly sur- 
prising that her emotional life had 
been affected. 

Connor was puzzled, neverthe- 
less, over the fact that she was 
selling all her furniture. There was, 
among several cherished pieces, a 
Gaudreau writing desk for which 
she had always shown an exagger- 
ated possessiveness. Suddenly 
aware that he could neither taste 
nor smell the imported tobacco 
which had seemed so good in his 
pouch, Connor extinguished his 
pipe and drove out onto the high- 
way. 

He had traveled south for some 
five miles before admitting to him- 
self that he was going to Avalon. 

The house itself was invisible, 
screened from the road by a high 
redbrick wall. Age had mellowed 
the brickwork, but the coping 
stones on top had a fresh appear- 
ance and were surmounted by a 
climb-proof wire fence. Connor 
drove along beside the wall until it 
curved inwards to a set of massive 
gates which were closed. At the 
sound of his horn a thickset man 
with a gun on his hip, wearing a 
uniform of cafe-au-lait gabardine, 



emerged from a lodge. He looked 
out through the gate without speak- 
ing. 

Connor lowered a car window 
and put his head out. “Is Miss Lo- 
mond at home?” 

“What’s your name?” the guard 
said. 

“I’m Philip Connor.” 

“Your name isn’t on my list.” 
"Look, I only asked if Miss Lo- 
mond was at home.” 

“I don’t give out information.” 
“But I’m a personal friend. 
You’re obliged to tell me whether 
she’s at home or not." 

“Is that a fact?” The guard 
turned and sauntered back into the 
lodge, ignoring Connor’s shouts 
and repeated blasts on the horn. 
Angered by the incident, Connor 
decided not to slink away. He began 
sounding the car horn in a steady 
bludgeoning rhythm — five seconds 
on, five seconds off. The guard did 
not reappear. Five minutes later a 
police cruiser pulled alongside with 
two state troopers in it and Connor 
was moved on with an injunction to 
calm down. 

For lack of anything better to do 
he went to his office. 

A week went by, during which 
time Connor drew a complete 
blank on the cigarette lighter and 
was almost forced to the conclusion 
that it had been custom-built by a 
modern Faberge. He spent hours 
trying to get a telephone number 
for Angela, without success. Sleep

began to elude him, and he felt 
himself nearing the boundary sepa- 
rating rationality from obsession. 
Finally, he saw a society column 
picture of Angela in a New York 
nightspot with Bobby Janke, play- 
boy son of an oil billionaire. Apart 
from making Connor feel ill with 
jealousy the newspaper item pro- 
vided him with the information that 
Angela was taking up residence at 
her newly acquired home sometime 
the following weekend. 

Who cares? he demanded of his 
shaving mirror. Who cares? 

He began drinking vodka tonics 
at lunchtime on Saturday, veered 
onto white rum during the after- 
noon, and by nightfall was suffused 
with a kind of alcoholic dharma 
which told him that he was entitled 
to see Angela and to employ any 
means necessary to achieve that 
end. There was the problem of the 
high brick wall but, with a flash of 
enlightenment, Connor realized 
that walls are mainly psychological 
barriers. To a person who under- 
stood their nature as well as he did, 
walls became doorways. Taking a 
mouthful of neat rum to strengthen 
his sense of purpose, Connor sent 
for his car. 

Avalon’s main entrance, scene of 
earlier defeat, was in darkness 
when he reached it, but lights were 
showing in the gate lodge. Connor 
drove on by, following the line of 
the wall, parked on a deserted 
stretch of second-class road. He 
switched off all lights, opened the 



trunk, took out a heavy hammer 
and chisel, crossed the verge and — 
without any preliminaries — attack- 
ed the wall. Ten minutes later, al- 
though the mortar was soft with 
age, he had not succeeded in re- 
moving one brick and was begin- 
ning to experience doubts. Then a 
brick came free and another vir- 
tually tumbled out after it. He en- 
larged the hole to an appropriate 
size and crawled through onto dry 
turf. 

A dwarfish half-moon was perch- 
ed near zenith, casting a wan ra- 
diance on the turrets and gables of 
a mansion which sat on the crest of 
a gentle rise. The building was dark 
and forbidding, and as he looked at 
it Connor felt the warm glow in his 
stomach fade away. He hesitated, 
swore at himself and set off up the 
slope, leaving his hammer and 
chisel behind. By bearing to the left 
he brought the front elevation of 
the building into view and was en- 
couraged to see one illuminated 
window on the first floor. He reach- 
ed a paved approach road, followed 
it to the Gothic-style front entrance 
and rang for admission. A full 
minute later the door was opened 
by an archetypal and startled-look- 
ing butler, and Connor sensed im- 
mediately that Angela was not at 
home. 

He cleared his throat. "Miss 
Lomond . .” 

"Miss Lomond is not expected 
until mid . 

“Midnight,” Connor put in, ex-

pertly taking his cue. “I know 
that — 1 was with her this afternoon 
in New York. We arranged that I 
would stop by for a late drink.” 
“I’m sorry, sir, but Miss Lomond 
didn’t tell me to expect visitors.” 
Connor looked surprised. “She 
didn’t? Well, the main thing is she 
remembered to let them know at 
the gate lodge.” He squeezed the 
butler’s arm democratically. “You 
know, you couldn't get through 
that gate in a Sherman tank if your 
name wasn’t on the list." 

The butler looked relieved. “One 
can’t be too careful these days, 
sir." 

“Quite right. I’m Mr. Connor, 
by the way — here’s my card. Now 
show me where I can wait for Miss 
Lomond. And, if it isn’t imposing 
too much. I’d like a Daiquiri. Just 
one to toy with while I’m waiting.” 
“Of course, Mr. Connor.” 
Exhilarated by his success, Con- 
nor was installed in an enormous 
green-and-silver room and supplied 
with a frosty glass. He sat in a very 
comfortable armchair and sipped 
his Daiquiri. It was the best he had 
ever tasted . 

The sense of relaxation prompted 
him to reach for his pipe but he dis- 
covered it must have been left at 
home. He prowled around the 
room, found a box of cigars on a 
sideboard and took one from it. He 
then glanced around for a lighter. 
His gaze fell on a transparent ruby- 
colored ovoid sitting upright on an 
occasional table. In no way did it 



resemble any table lighter he had 
ever seen, but he had become mor- 
bidly sensitive on the subject, and 
the ovoid was positioned where he 
would have expected a lighter to be. 

Connor picked it up, held it to 
the light and found it was perfectly 
clear, without visible works. That 
meant it could not be a lighter. As 
he was setting it down, he allowed 
his thumb to slide into a seductively 
shaped depression on the side. 

A pea-sized ball of radiance — 
like a bead fashioned from sun- 
light — appeared at the top of the 
egg. It shone with absolute steadi- 
ness until he removed his thumb 
from the dimple. 

Fascinated by his find, he made 
the tiny globe of brilliance appear 
and disappear over and over again, 
proved its hotness with a fingertip. 
He took out the pocket magnifier 
he always carried for evaluating 
trinkets and examined the tip of the 
egg. The glass revealed a minute 
silver plug set flush with the sur- 
face, but nothing more. Following 
a hunch, Connor carefully guided 
one drop of liquid from his drink 
onto the egg and made sure it was 
covering the nearly invisible plug. 
When he operated the lighter it 
worked perfectly, the golden bead 
burning without wavering until the 
liquid had boiled off into the air. 

He set the lighter down and 
noticed yet another strange prop- 
erty — the ruby egg was smoothly 
rounded at the bottom yet it sat up- 
right. with no tendency to topple 



54 



GALAXY 



over. His magnifier showed an 
ornate letter P engraved in the 
base, but provided no clue as to 
how the balancing act was achieved. 

Connor gulped the remainder of 
his drink and, with eyes suddenly 
sober and watchful took a fresh 
look around the room. He discover- 
ed a beautiful clock, apparently 
carved from solid onyx. As he had 
half-expected there was no way to 
open it and the same elaborate P 
was engraved on the underside. 

There was also a television set 
which had a superficial resem- 
blance to an expensive commercial 
model but which bore no maker’s 
name plaque. He checked it over 
and found the now-familiar P in- 
scribed on one side where it would 
never be noticed except by a person 
making a purposeful search. When 
he switched the set on the image of 
a newscaster which appeared was 
so perfect that he might have been 
looking through a plate glass win- 
dow into the man's face. Connor 
studied the picture from a distance 
of only a few inches and could not 
resolve it into lines or dots. His 
magnifier achieved no better re- 
sults. 

He switched the television off 
and returned to the armchair, filled 
with a strange and powerful emo- 
tion. Although it was in his nature 
to be sharp and acquisitive — those 
were attributes without which he 
could never have entered his chosen 
profession — it had always remained 
uppermost in his mind that the 



world’s supply of money was un- 
limited, whereas his own allocation 
of years was hopelessly inadequate. 
He could have trebled his income 
by working longer and pushing 
harder, but had always chosen an- 
other course simply because his de- 
sire for possessions had never taken 
control. 

That, however, had been before 
he discovered the sort of posses- 
sions real money could buy. He 
knew he was particularly suscep- 
tible to gadgets and toys, but the 
knowledge did nothing to lessen the 
harsh raw hunger he now felt. 

There was no way that anybody 
was going to stop him from joining 
the ranks of those who could afford 
future-technology artifacts. He 
would prefer to do it by marrying 
Angela, because he loved her and 
would enjoy sharing the experi- 
ences, but if she refused to have 
him back he would do it by making 
the necessary millions himself. 

A phrase which had been part of 
his train of thought isolated itself in 
his mind. Future technology. He 
weighed the implications for a mo- 
ment then shrugged them off — he 
had lost enough mental equilibrium 
without entertaining fantasies about 
time travel. 

The idea, though, was an in- 
triguing one. And it answered 
certain questions. The lighters he 
coveted, partly for their perfection 
and partly because they could earn 
him a fortune, were technically far 
in advance of anything on the

world's markets, yet it was within 
the realms of possibility that a fur- 
tive genius was producing them in a 
back room somewhere. But that 
impossibly good television set could 
not have been manufactured with- 
out the R&D facilities of a powerful 
electronics concern. The notion 
that they were being made in the 
future and shipped back in time 
was only slightly less ridiculous 
than the idea of a secret industry 
catering exclusively for the super- 
rich . 

C onnor picked up the cigar and 
lit it, childishly pleased at hav- 
ing a reason to put the ruby egg to 
work. His first draw on the cool 
smoke gave him the feeling that he 
had been searching for something 
all his life and suddenly had found 
it. Cautiously at first and then with 
intense pleasure he filled his lungs 
with the unexpected fragrance. 

He luxuriated. This was smoking 
as portrayed by tobacco company 
commercials — not the shallow dis- 
appointing experience commonly 
known to smokers everywhere. He 
had often wondered why the leaf 
which smelled so beguiling before it 
was lit, or when someone nearby 
was smoking, promising sensual 
delights and heart’s ease, never 
yielded anything more than vir- 
tually tasteless smoke. 

They promise you 'a long cool 
smoke to soothe a troubled world'. 
Connor thought, and this is it. He 
took the cigar from his mouth and 



examined the band. It was of un- 
embellished gold and bore a single 
ornate P. 

“I might have known,” he an- 
nounced to the empty room. He 
looked around through a filigree of 
smoke, wondering if everything in 
the room was different from the 
norm, superior, better than the 
best. Perhaps the ultra-rich scorned 
to use anything that was available 
to the man-in-the-street or adver- 
tised on television or . 

“Philip!” Angela stood in the 
doorway, pale of face, shocked and 
angry. “What are you doing here?” 
“Enjoying the best cigar I’ve ever 
had.” Connor got to his feet, smil- 
ing. “I presume you keep them for 
the benefit of guests — I mean, a 
cigar is hardly your style.” 

“Where’s Gilbert?” she snapped. 
“You’re leaving right now.” 

“Not a chance.” 

“That’s what you think.” Angela 
turned with an angry flail of blonde 
hair and cerise skirts. 

Connor realized he had to find 
inspiration and get in fast. “It’s too 
late, Angela. I’ve smoked your 
cigar, I lit it with your lighter, I 
have checked the time with your 
clock, and I’ve watched your tele- 
vision." 

He had been hoping for a notice- 
able reaction and was not disap- 
pointed — Angela burst into tears. 
“You bastard! You had no right!" 

She ran to the table, picked up 
the lighter and tried to make it 
work. Nothing happened. She went 



56 



GALAXY 



to the clock, which had stopped; 
and to the television set, which re- 
mained lifeless when she switched it 
on. Connor followed her circuit of 
the room, feeling guilty and baffled. 
Angela dropped into a chair and 
sat with her face in her hands, 
huddled and trembling like a sick 
bird. The sight of her distress pro- 
duced a painful churning in his 
chest. He knelt in front of Angela. 

“Listen, Angie," he said. “Don’t 
cry like that. I only wanted to see 
you again — 1 haven’t done any- 
thing." 

“You touched my stuff and made 
it change. They told me it would 
change if anybody but a client used 
it . and it has.” 

“This doesn't make sense. Who 
said what would change?” 

“The suppliers.” She looked at 
him with tear-brimmed eyes and all 
at once he became aware of a per- 
fume so exquisite that he wanted to 
fall toward its source like a suffo- 
cating man striving toward air. 

“What did you . .? I 
don't . .” 

“They said it would all be 
spoiled.” 

Connor tried to fight off the ef- 
fects of the witch-magic he had 
breathed. “Nothing has been spoil- 
ed, Angie. There’s been a power 
failure ... or something . .” His 
words trailed away uncertainly. 
The clock and the television set 
were cordless. He took a nervous 
drag on the half-smoked cigar and 
almost gagged on the flat acrid 



taste of it. The sharp sense of loss 
he experienced while stubbing it 
out seemed to obliterate all traces 
of his scepticism. 

He returned to Angela’s chair 
and knelt again. "They said this 
stuff would stop working if anybody 
but you touched it?” 

“Yes.” 

“But how could that be arrang- 
ed?” 

She dabbed her eyes with a hand- 
kerchief. “How would I know? 
When Mr. Smith came over from 
Trenton he said something about 
all his goods having an . essence 
field, and he said I had a molecular 
thumbprint. Does that make 
sense?” 

“It almost does,” Connor whis- 
pered. “A perfect security system. 
Even if you lost your lighter at the 
theatre, when somebody else picked 
it up it would cease to be what it 
was.” 

“Or when somebody breaks into 
your home.” 

“Believe me, it was only because 
1 had to see you again. Angie. You 
know that I love you.” 

“Do you, Philip?” 

“Yes, darling.” He was thrilled 
to hear the special softness return 
to her voice. “Look, you have to let 
me pay for a new lighter and tele- 
vision and . .” 

Angela was shaking her head. 
“You couldn’t do it, Philip.” 

“Why not?” He took her hand 
and was further encouraged when 
she allowed it to remain in his.

She gave him a tremulous smile. 
"You just couldn’t. The install- 
ments are too high.” 

“Installments? For God’s sake, 
Angie, you don’t buy stuff on 
time.” 

“You can’t buy these things — 
you pay for a service. I pay in in- 
stallments of eight hundred and 
sixty-four thousand dollars.” 

“A year?” 

“Once every forty-three days. I 
shouldn't be telling you all this, 
but . 

Connor gave an incredulous 
laugh. “That comes to about six 
million a year — nobody would pay 
that much!” 

“Some people would. If you even 
have to think about the cost Mr. 
Smith doesn’t do business with 
you.” 

“But . .’’ Connor incautiously 
leaned within range of Angela’s 
perfume and it took his mind. 
“You realize,” he said in a weak 
voice, “that all your new toys come 
from the future? There’s something 
fantastically wrong about the whole 
set-up.” 

"I’ve missed you, Philip.” 

"That perfume you’re wearing — 
did it come from Mr. Smith, too?” 

“1 tried not to miss you, but I 
did." Angela pressed her face 
against his and he felt the coolness 
of tears on her check. He kissed her 
hungrily as she moved down from 
the chair to kneel against him. 
Connor spun towards the center of 
a whirlpool of ecstasy. 



“Life’s going to be so good when 
we’re married," he heard himself 
saying after a time. “Better than we 
could ever have dreamed. There’s 
no much for us to share and ...” 
Angela’s body stiffened and she 
thrust herself away from him. 
“You’d better go now, Philip.” 
“What is it? What did I say?” 
“You gave yourself away, that’s 
all.” 

Connor thought back. “Was it 
what I said about sharing? I didn’t 
mean your money — I was talking 
about life . the years ... the ex- 
periences.” 

“Did you?” 

“I loved you before you even 
knew you would inherit a cent.” 
“You never mentioned marriage 
before.” 

“I thought that was understood,” 
he said desperately. "I thought 
you ...” He stopped speaking as 
he saw the look in Angela’s eyes. 
Cool, suspicious, disdainful. The 
look that the very rich had always 
given to outsiders who tried to get 
into their club without the vital 
qualification of wealth. 

She touched a bellpush and con- 
tinued standing with her back to 
him until he was shown out of the 
room. 



T he ensuing days were bad ones 
for Connor. He drank a lot, 
realized that alcohol was no answer, 
and went on drinking. For a while 
he tried getting in touch with 



58 



GALAXY 



Angela and once even drove down 
to Avalon. The brickwork had been 
repaired at the point where he had 
made his entry, and a close inspec- 
tion revealed that the entire wall 
was now covered with a fine mesh. 
He had no doubt that tampering 
with it in any way would trigger off 
an alarm system. 

When he awoke during the night 
he was kept awake by hammering 
questions. What was it all about? 
Why did Angela have to make such 
odd payments, and at such odd 
intervals? What would men from 
the future want with Twentieth 
Century currency? 

On several occasions the thought 
occurred that, instead of concen- 
trating on Angela, he would do 
better to find the mysterious Mr. 
Smith of Trenton. The flicker of 
optimism the idea produced was 
quenched almost immediately by 
the realization that he simply did 
not have enough information to 
provide a lead. It was a certainty 
that the man was not even known 
as Smith to anybody but his clients. 
If only Angela had revealed some- 
thing more — like Smith's business 
address . 

Connor returned each time to 
brooding and drinking, aware but 
uncaring that his behavior was be- 
coming completely obsessive. Then 
he awoke one morning to the dis- 
covery that he already knew Smith’s 
business address, had known it for 
a long time, almost from child- 
hood. 



Undecided as to whether his in- 
take of white rum had hastened or 
delayed the revelation, he break- 
fasted on strong coffee and was too 
busy with his thoughts to fret about 
the black liquid being more taste- 
less than ever. He formulated a 
plan of action during the next hour, 
twice lighting his pipe — out of 
sheer habit — before remembering 
he was finished with ordinary to- 
bacco forever. As a first step in the 
plan he went out, bought a five-inch 
cube of ruby-colored plastic and 
paid the owner of a jobbing shop an 
exorbitant sum to have the block 
machined down to a polished ovoid. 
It was late in the afternoon before 
the work was finished, but the end 
product sufficiently resembled a P- 
brand table lighter to fool anyone 
who was not looking too closely at 
it. 

Pleased with his progress thus 
far, Connor went back to his apart- 
ment and dug out the .38 pistol he 
had bought a few years earlier 
following an attempted burglary. 
Common sense told him it was 
rather late to leave for Trenton and 
that he would be better waiting 
until morning, but he was in a 
warmly reckless mood. With the 
plastic egg bumping on one hip and 
the gun on the other, he drove west- 
ward out of town. 



C onnor reached the center of 
Trenton just as the stores were 
showing signs of closing for the

day. His sudden fear of being too 
late and of having to wait another 
day after all was strengthened by 
the discovery that he was no longer 
so certain about locating Mr. 
Smith. 

In the freshness of the morning, 
with an alcoholic incense lingering 
in his head, it had all seemed 
simple and straightforward. For 
much of his life he had been 
peripherally aware that in almost 
every big city there are stores which 
have no right to be in existence. 
They were always small and dis- 
creet, positioned some way off the 
main shopping thoroughfares, and 
their signs usually bore legends — 
like “Johnston Bros” or “H&L” — 
which seemed designed to convey a 
minimum of information. If they 
had a window display at all it 
tended to be nothing more than an 
undistinguished and slightly out-of- 
style sport jacket priced three times 
above what it had any chance of 
fetching. Connor knew the stores 
were not viable propositions in the 
ordinary way because, not surpris- 
ingly, nobody ever went into them. 
Yet in his mind they were in some 
indefinable way associated with 
money. 

Setting out for Trenton he had 
been quite sure of the city block he 
wanted — now at least three loca- 
tions and images of three unre- 
markable store fronts were merging 
and blurring in his memory. That's 
how they avoid attention, he 
thought, refusing to be dishearten- 



ed, and began cruising the general 
area he had selected. The rush of 
home-going traffic hampered every 
movement and finally he decided 
he would do better on foot. He 
parked in a sidestreet and began 
hurrying from corner to corner, 
each time convincing himself he 
was about to look along a remem- 
bered block and see the place he so 
desperately wanted to find, each 
time being disappointed. Virtually 
all the stores were closed by now, 
the crowds had thinned away, and 
the reddish evening sunlight made 
the quiet dusty facades look unreal. 
Connor ran out of steam, physical 
and mental. 

He swore dejectedly, shrugged 
and started limping back to his car, 
choosing — as a token act of de- 
fiance — a route which took him a 
block further south than he had 
originally intended going. His feet 
were hot and so painful that he was 
unable to think of anything but his 
own discomfort. Consequently he 
did a genuine double-take when he 
reached an intersection, glanced 
sideways and saw a half-familiar 
half-forgotten vista of common- 
place stores, wholesalers' depots 
and anonymous doorways. His 
heart began a slow pounding as he 
picked out, midway on the block, a 
plain store front whose complete 
lack of character would have ren- 
dered it invisible to eyes other than 
his own. 

He walked towards it, suddenly 
nervous, until he could read the

sign which said general agencies 
in tarnished gold lettering. The 
window contained three pieces of 
glazed earthenware sewer pipe, be- 
yond which were screens to prevent 
anyone seeing the store’s interior. 
Connor expected to find the door 
locked, but it opened at his touch 
and he was inside without even hav- 
ing had time to prepare himself. He 
blinked at a tall gaunt man who 
was standing motionless behind a 
counter. The man had a down- 
curving mouth, ice-smooth gray 
hair, and something about him 
gave Connor the impression that he 
had been standing there, unmov- 
ing, for hours. He was dressed in 
funeral director black, with a silver 
tie, and the collar of his white shirt 
was perfect as the petals of a newly- 
opened flower. 

The man leaned forward slightly 
and said, “Was there something, 
sir?” 

Connor was taken aback by the 
quaintness of the greeting but he 
strode to the counter, brought the 
ruby egg from his pocket and 
banged it down. 

“Tell Mr. Smith I’m not satisfied 
with this thing,” he said in an 
angry voice. "And tell him I de- 
mand a repayment." 

The tall man’s composure seem- 
ed to shatter. He picked up the egg, 
half-turned toward an inner door, 
then paused and examined the egg 
more closely. 

"Just a minute,” he said. “This 
isn't . .” 



“Isn’t what?” 

The man looked accusingly at 
Connor. “I’ve no idea what this 
object is, and we haven't got a Mr. 
Smith.” 

“Know what this object is?” 
Connor produced his revolver. He 
had seen and heard enough. 

“You wouldn’t dare.” 

“No?" Connor aimed the revol- 
ver at the other man’s face and 
aware that the safety catch was on, 
gave the trigger an obvious squeeze. 
The tall man shrank against the 
wall. Connor muttered furiously, 
clicked the safety off, and raised 
the gun again. 

“Don’t!” The man shook his 
head. “I beseech you." 

Connor had never been beseech- 
ed his his life but he did not allow 
the curious turn of speech to dis- 
tract him. He said, “I want to see 
Mr. Smith." 

“I’ll take you to him. If you will 
follow me . .’’ 

They went through to the rear of 
the premises and down a flight of 
stairs which had inconveniently 
high risers and narrow treads. Not- 
ing that his guide was descending 
with ease, Connor glanced down 
and saw that the tall man had ab- 
normally small feet. There was an- 
other peculiarity about his gait but 
it was not until they had reached 
the basement floor and were mov- 
ing along a corridor that Connor 
realized what it was. Within the 
chalk -stripe trousers, the tall man’s 
knees appeared to be a good two-

thirds of the way down his legs. 
Cool fingers of unease touched 
Connor’s brow. 

"Here we are, sir.” The black- 
clad figure before him pushed open 
a door. 



B eyond it was a large brightly-lit 
room and at one side was 
another tall cadaverous man dress- 
ed like a funeral director. He too 
had ice-smooth gray hair and he 
was carefully putting an antique oil 
painting into the dark rectangular 
opening of a wall safe. 

Without turning his head, he 
said, “What is it, Toynbee?” 
Connor slammed the door shut 
behind himself. "1 want to talk to 
you. Smith." 

Smith gave a violent start, but 
continued gently sliding the gold- 
framed painting into the wall. 
When it had disappeared he turned 
to face Connor. He had a down- 
curved mouth and — even more dis- 
turbingly — his knees, also, seemed 
to be in the wrong place. If these 
people come from the future. Con- 
nor thought, why are they made 
differently from us? His mind shied 
away from the new thought and 
plunged into irrelevant speculations 
about the kind of chairs Smith and 
Toynbee must use ... if any. He 
realized he had seen no seats or 
stools about the place. With a 
growing coldness in his veins, Con- 
nor recalled his earlier impression 
that Toynbee had been standing 



behind the counter for hours, with- 
out moving. 

"... welcome.to what money we 
have,” Smith was saying, “but 
there’s nothing else here worth tak- 
ing." 

”1 don’t think he’s a thief.” 
Toynbee went and stood beside 
him. 

“Not a thief! Then what does he 
want? What is . .? 

“Just for starters,” Connor put 
in, “I want an explanation." 

“Of what?” 

“Of your entire operation here.” 

Smith looked mildly exasperated. 
He gestured at the wooden crates 
which tilled much of the room. 
“It's a perfectly normal agency set- 
up handling various industrial pro- 
ducts on a . .” 

“I mean the operation whereby 
you supply rich people with ciga- 
rette lighters that nobody on this 
Earth could manufacture." 

"Cigarette lighters — ” 

"The red egg-shaped ones which 
have no works but light when 
they’re wet and stand upright with- 
out support." 

Smith shook his head. “I wish 1 
could get into something like that.” 

“And the television sets which 
are too good. And the clocks and 
cigars and all the other things 
which are so perfect that people 
who can afford it are willing to pay 
eight hundred sixty-four thousand 
dollars every forty-three days for 
them — even though the goodies are 
charged with an essence field which

fades out and converts them to junk 
if they fall into the hands of any- 
body who isn't in the club.” 

“1 don’t understand a word of 
this." 

"It's no use, Mr. Smith,” Toyn- 
bee said. "Somebody has talked.” 
Smith gave him a venomous 
stare. “You just did. you fool!” In 
his anger Smith moved closer to 
Toynbee, so that his body was no 
longer shielding the wall safe. 
Connor noticed for the first time 
that it was exceptionally large, and 
it occurred to him that a basement 
storeroom was an odd place for that 
particular type of safe. He looked 
at it more closely. The darkness of 
the interior revealed no trace of the 
oil painting he had just seen loaded 
into it. And, far into the tunnel-like 
blackness, a bright green star was 
throwing off expanding rings of 
light, rings which faded as they 
grew. 

Connor made a new effort to 
retain his grasp of the situation. He 
pointed to the safe and said, 
casually, “I assume that’s a two- 
way transporter." 

Smith was visibly shaken. “All 
right,” he said, after a tense 
silence, “who talked to you?” 
“Nobody.” Connor felt he could 
get Angela into trouble of some 
kind by mentioning her name. 

Toynbee cleared his throat. “I’ll 
bet it was that Miss Lomond. I’ve 
always said you can’t trust the nou- 
veau riche — the proper instincts 
aren't sufficiently ingrained.” 



Smith nodded agreement. “You 
are right. She got a replacement 
table lighter, television and clock — 
the things this . person has just 
mentioned. She said they had been 
detuned by someone who broke 
into her house.” 

“She must have told him every- 
thing she knew.” 

“And broken her contract — 
make a note of that, Mr. Toynbee." 

“Hold on a minute,” Connor 
said loudly, brandishing the re- 
volver to remind them he was in 
control. “Nobody’s going to make a 
note of anything till I get the 
answers I want. These products you 
deal in — do they come from the 
future or — somewhere?” 

“From somewhere,” Smith told 
him. “Actually, they come from a 
short distance in the future as well, 
but — as far as you are concerned — 
the important thing is that they are 
transported over many light years. 
The time difference is incidental, 
and quite difficult to prove.” 
“They’re from another planet?” 
“Yes.” 

“You, too?” 

“Of course." 

“You bring advanced products 
to Earth in secret and sell or rent 
them to rich people?” 

“Yes. Only smaller stuff comes 
here, of course — larger items, like 
the television sets, come in at main 
receivers in other cities. The details 
of the operation may be surprising, 
but surely the general principles of 
commerce are well known to you.”

“That’s exactly what’s bothering 
me,” Connor said. “I don’t give a 
damn about other worlds and 
matter transmitters, but 1 can’t see 
why you go to all this trouble. Earth 
currency would be of no value 
on . wherever you come from. 
You’re ahead on technology, so 
there is nothing . Connor 
stopped talking as he remembered 
what Smith had been feeding into 
the black rectangle. An old oil 
painting. 

Smith nodded, looking more re- 
laxed. “You are right about your 
currency being useless on another 
world. We spend it here. Humanity 
is primitive in many respects, but 
the race’s artistic genius is quite re- 
markable. Our organization makes 
a good trading surplus by exporting 
paintings and sculptures. You see 
the goods we import are compara- 
tively worthless.” 

“They seem valuable to me.” 

“They would seem that way to 
you — that’s the whole point. We 
don’t bother bringing in the things 
that Earth can produce reasonably 
well. Your wines and other drinks 
aren’t too bad, so we don’t touch 
them. But your coffee!” Smith’s 
mouth curved even further down- 
ward. 

"That means you’re spending 
millions. Somebody should have 
noticed one outfit buying up so 
much stuff.” 

“Not really. We do quite a bit of 
direct buying at auctions and 
galleries, but often our clients buy 



on our behalf and we credit their 
accounts.” 

“Oh, no,” Connor breathed as 
the ramifications of what Smith 
was saying unfolded new vistas in 
his mind. Was this why million- 
aires, even the most unlikely types 
of men, so often became art col- 
lectors? Was this the raison d'etre 
for that curious phenomenon, the 
private collection? In a society 
where the rich derived so much 
pleasure from showing off their 
possessions, why did so many art 
treasures disappear from the public 
view? Was it because their owners 
were trading them in against P- 
brand products? If that was the 
case the organization concerned 
must be huge and it must have been 
around for a long time. Connor’s 
legs suddenly felt tired. 

He said, "Let’s sit down and talk 
about this.” 

Smith looked slightly uncomfort- 
able. “We don’t sit. Why don’t 
you use one of those crates if you 
aren’t feeling well?” 

“There’s nothing wrong with me, 
so don’t try anything,” Connor said 
sharply, but he sat on the edge of a 
box while his brain worked to as- 
similate shocking new concepts. 
“What does the P stand for on your 
products?” 

"Can’t you guess?" 

“Perfect?" 

“That is correct." 

The readiness with which Smith 
was now giving information made 
Connor a little wary, but he pressed 



64 



GALAXY 



on with other questions which had 
been gnawing at him. “Miss Lo- 
mond told me her installments w ere 
eight hundred and sixty-four thou- 
sand dollars — why that particular 
figure? Why not a million?” 

“That is a million — in our 
money. A rough equivalent, of 
course.” 

“I see. And the forty-three days." 

"One revolution of our primary 
moon. It’s a natural accounting 
period." 

Connor almost began to wish the 
flow of information would slow 
down. "1 still don’t see the need for 
all this secrecy. Why not come out 
in the open, reduce your unit prices 
and multiply the volume? You 
could make a hundred times as 
much." 

"We have to work underground 
for a number of reasons. In all 
probability the various Earth gov- 
ernments would object to the loss of 
art treasures, and there are certain 
difficulties at the other end.” 

“Such as?” 

“There's a law against influenc- 
ing events on worlds which are at a 
sensitive stage of their develop- 
ment. This limits our supply of 
trade goods very sharply." 

“In other words, you are crooks 
on your own world and crooks on 
this one.” 

"I don’t agree. What harm do we 
do on Earth?” 

“You’ve already named it — -you 
are depriving the people of this 
planet of ..." 



“Of their artistic heritage?” 
Smith gave a thin sneer. “How 
many people do you know who 
would give up a Perfect television 
set to keep a da Vinci cartoon in a 
public art gallery five or ten thou- 
sand miles away?” 

“You’ve got a point there,” 
Connor admitted. “What have you 
got up your sleeve. Smith?" 

"I don’t understand." 

"Don’t play innocent You would 
not have talked so freely unless you 
were certain I wouldn’t get out of 
here with the information. What 
are you planning to do about me?" 

Smith glanced at Toynbee and 
sighed. “1 keep forgetting how 
parochial the natives of a single- 
planet culture can be. You have 
been told that we are from another 
world, and yet to you we are just 
slightly unusual Earth people. I 
don’t suppose it has occurred to 
you that other races could have a 
stronger instinct toward honesty, 
that deviousness and lies would 
come less easily to them than to 
humans?" 

“That’s where we are most vul- 
nerable,” Toynbee put in. "I see 
now that 1 w as too inexperienced to 
be up front.” 

“AH right, then — be honest with 
me." Connor said. “You are plan- 
ning to keep me quiet, aren't you?" 

"As a matter of fact, we do have 
a little device . .’’ 

“You don’t need it." Connor 
said. He thought back carefully 
over all he had been told, then

stood up and handed his revolver to 
Smith. 

T he good life was all that he had 
expected it to be, and — as he 
drove south to Avalon — Connor 
could feel it getting better by the 
minute. 

His business sense had always 
been sharp, but whereas he had 
once reckoned a month’s profits in 
thousands, he now thought in 
terms of six figures. Introductions, 
opportunities and deals came thick 
and fast, and always it was the P- 
brand artifacts which magically 
paved the way. During important 
first contacts he had only to use his 
gold lighter to ignite a pipeful of 
P-brand tobacco — the incredible 
leaf which fulfilled all the promise 
of its “nose”, or glance at his P- 
brand watch, or write with the pen 
which produced any color at the 
touch of a spectrum ring, and all 
doors were opened wide. The 
various beautiful trinkets were in- 
dividually styled, but he quickly 
learned to recognize them when 
they were displayed by others, and 
to make the appropriate responses. 

Within a few weeks, although he 
was scarcely aware of it, his outlook 
on life had undergone a profound 
change. At first he was merely un- 
easy or suspicious when approach- 
ed by people who failed to show the 
talismen. Then he became hostile, 
preferring to associate only with 
those who could prove they were 
safe. 



Satisfying though his new life 
was, Connor had decided it would 
not be perfect until Angela and he 
were reunited. It was through her 
that he had achieved awareness and 
only through her would he achieve 
completeness. He would have made 
the journey to Avalon much sooner 
but for the fact that there had been 
certain initial difficulties with 
Smith and Toynbee. Handing over 
the revolver had been a dangerous 
gambit which had almost resulted 
in his being bundled through their 
matter transmitter to an unknown 
fate on another world. Luckily, 
however, it had also convinced 
them that he had something impor- 
tant to say. 

He had talked quickly and well 
that evening in the basement of the 
undistinguished little store. Smith, 
who was the senior of the pair, had 
been hard to convince; but his 
interest had quickened as Connor 
enumerated all the weaknesses in 
the organization’s procurement 
methods. And it had grown feverish 
when he heard how Connor’s 
worldly knowhow would eliminate 
much of the w asteful financial com- 
petition of auctions, would stream- 
line the system of purchasing 
through rich clients, would institute 
foolproof controls and effective new 
techniques for diverting art trea- 
sures into the organization’s hands. 
It had been the best improvisation 
of his life, sketchy in places because 
of his unfamiliarity with the art 
world, but filled with an inspired 



66 



GALAXY 



professionalism which carried his 
audience along with it. 

Early results had been so good 
that Smith had become possessive, 
voicing objections to Connor’s pro- 
fitable side dealings. Connor 
smoothed things over by going on 
to a seven-day work schedule in 
which he also worked most eve- 
nings. This had made it difficult to 
find the time to visit Angela, but 
finally his need to see her had 
become so great that he had pushed 
everything else aside and made the 
time . 

The guard at the gate lodge was 
the same man as before, but he 
gave no sign of remembering his 
earlier brush with Connor. He 
waved the car on through with a 
minimum of delay, and a few 
minutes later Connor was walking 
up the broad front steps of the 
house. The place looked much less 
awesome to Connor but while ring- 
ing for admission he decided that 
he and Angela would probably 
keep it, for sentimental reasons as 
much as anything else. The butler 
who answered the door was a new 
man, who looked rather like a 
retired seaman, and there was a 
certain lack of smoothness in his 
manner as he showed Connor to the 
large room where Angela was wait- 
ing. She was standing at the fire- 
place with her back tp the door, 
just as he had last seen her. 

“Angie," he said, "it’s good to 
see you again." 

She turned and ran to him. "I’ve 



missed you so much, Phil.” 

As they clung together in the cen- 
ter of the green-and-silver room 
Connor experienced a moment of 
exquisite happiness. He buried his 
face in her hair and began whis- 
pering the things he had been un- 
able to say for what seemed a long, 
long time. Angela answered him 
feverishly all the while he spoke, re- 
sponding to the emotion rather 
than the words. 

It was during the first kiss that 
he became aware of a disturbing 
fact. She was wearing expensive yet 
ordinary perfume — not one of the 
P-brand distillations of magic to 
which he had become accustomed 
on the golden creatures he had 
dated casually during the past few 
weeks. Still holding Angela close to 
him he glanced around the big 
room. A leaden coldness began to 
spread through his body. Every- 
thing in the room was, like her per- 
fume, excellent — but not Perfect. 

“Angela," he said quietly, “why 
did you ask me to come here?” 

“What kind of a question is that, 
darling?” 

“It’s a perfectly normal ques- 
tion.” Connor disengaged from her 
and stepped back suspiciously. "1 
merely asked what your motives 
were." 

“Motives.''' Angela stared at him, 
color Peeing from her cheeks, then 
her gaze darted to his wristwatch. 
“My God. Philip, you’re inf You 
made it, just like you said you 
would.”

“I don't know what you mean.” 

"Don’t try that with me — re- 
member I was the one who told it 
all to you." 

"You should have learned not to 
talk by this time." 

“1 know 1 should, but I didn’t.” 
Angela advanced on him. “I’m out 
now. I'm on the outside." 

‘‘It isn’t all that bad, is it? 
Where's Bobby Janke and the rest 
of his crowd?" 

“None of them come near me 
now. And you know why.” 

“At least you're not broke." 
Small solace. 

She shook her head. “I’ve got 
plenty of money, but what good is it 
when 1 can’t buy the things I want? 
I’m shut out, and it’s all because I 
couldn't keep myself from blabbing 
to you. and because 1 didn't report 
the way you were getting on to 
them. But you didn’t mind inform- 
ing on me, did you?” 

Connor opened his mouth to 
protest his innocence, then realized 
it would make no difference. “It’s 
been nice seeing you again, 
Angela," he said. “I’m sorry I can’t 
stay longer but things are stacking 
up on me back at the office. You 
know how it is.” 

“1 know exactly how it is. Go on, 
Philip — get out of here." 

Connor crossed to the door, but 
hesitated as Angela made a faint 
sound. 

She said, “Stay with me, Phil. 
Please stay." 

He stood with his back to her, ex- 



periencing a pain which slowly 
faded, then he walked out. 

L ate that afternoon Connor was 
i sitting in his new office when 
his secretary put through a call. It 
was Smith, anxious to discuss the 
acquisition of a collection of 
antique silver. 

"I called you earlier but your girl 
told me you were out," he said, 
with a hint of reproach. 

"It’s true,” Connor assured him. 
"I was out of town — Angela Lo- 
mond asked me down to her 
place." 

"Oh?" 

“You didn’t tell me she was no 
longer a client.” 

“You should have known with- 
out being told.” Smith was silent 
for a few seconds. “Is she going to 
try making trouble?" 

"No.” 

"What did she want?" 

Connor leaned back in his chair 
and gazed out through the window, 
toward the Atlantic. “Who knows? 
I didn’t stay long enough to find 
out." 

“Very wise,” Smith said compla- 
cently. 

When the call had ended, Connor 
brewed some P-brand coffee, using 
the supply he kept locked in the 
drinks cabinet. The Perfection of it 
soothed from his mind the last 
lingering traces of remorse. 

How on Earth, he wondered idly, 
do they manage to make it taste 
exactly the way it smells? ★

IS THERE HOPE 
FORTHE FUTURE? 



ISAAC ASIMOV 



A t any time and under any condi- 
tions it is possible to consider 
the future either pessimistically or 
optimistically. 

It is. after all, never possible to 
predict the future sharply; one can 
only make an estimate, and that 
estimate will cover a range of possi- 
bilities. The farther into the future 
we look, the broader the range. 
And if we look far enough the range 
becomes so broad that our predic- 
tions have no constraint worth men- 
tioning other than the laws of 
nature. The range will also be 
broader as we deal with more and 
more poorly understood phenom- 
ena (with human psychology, for 
instance, rather than with atomic 
physics) until it becomes too broad 
to make prediction useful. 

If, however, we restrict ourselves 
to the moderately close future and 
to moderately well-understood phe- 
nomena. we end up with a range of 



possibilities that is not prohibitively 
broad. We are then at liberty to 
suppose ourselves anywhere within 
the range, and it is possible to end 
up with a pessimistic prediction if 
we choose to use one extreme of the 
range and with an optimistic one if 
we choose to use the other. 

I T is, for instance, particularly 
easy to be pessimistic about the 
future right now. We need merely 
assume that population will con- 
tinue going up, that national rival- 
ries will continue to place the well- 
being of Group X ahead of the wel- 
fare of the world, that racist and 
sexist prejudice will continue to 
generate hatred and alienation, 
that personal and economic greed 
will continue to ruin the Earth for 
short-term private profit. In short 
we need merely assume that things 
will go on exactly as they have been 
for another thirty years and we can 



69 



confidently predict the end of our 
technological civilization. 

I suspect that the chances are 
better than 50 percent that this will 
happen — how much better 1 am not 
certain. I 

But things don't have to go on as 
they are. Things do change, and 
surprisingly rapidly, too. 

Place yourself in 1954, for in- 
stance. It is the height of the com- 
placent Eisenhower era; the depths 
of the Dulles cold-war. The United 
States was then as its most self-con- 
fident and sanctimonious point in 
history. 

Would you have then imagined 
that — over the next two decades — 
contraception would become social- 
ly acceptable, a birth control pill 
would lead to sexual revolution, 
abortion would become legal in 
many places, ‘cold war’ would be- 
come a dirty word — and that the 
very man who had, in earlier years, 
specialized in Hag, mom, and 
applepic rhetoric would, as Presi- 
dent, lead the way to closer friend- 
ship with the Soviet Union and with 
what he now calls the People’s Re- 
public of China?! 

I tell you that in 1954 it was a lot 
easier to predict — and to have it be- 
lieved — that men would stand on 
the Moon in fifteen years than that 
any of the situations listed in the 
previous paragraph would come to 
pass. 

Why did all those things come 
true? No mystery at all. The steady 
increase in population and the 



steady decline in resources has 
faced mankind with a choice of 1) 
destruction, or 2) population con- 
trol and world government. 

The changes that have taken 
place in the last twenty years have 
been in the direction of population 
control and world government and 
were more or less inevitable if one 
had been willing to look the future 
in the face. 

The changes so far have been 
comparatively small and tentative 
and are far from sufficient to pre- 
vent disaster. 1 think it is safe to 
suppose, however, that mankind 
will continue to move in the direc- 
tion of population control and 
world government as, each year, 
the scope of disaster — and the 
speed with which it approaches — 
impresses mankind with a greater 
and greater horror. 

The question is not whether or 
not mankind will move in this 
direction — it will! — but whether it 
will move in this direction rapidly 
enough. Again, my own feeling is 
that the probability of rapid- 
enough motion is less than 50 per- 
cent', how much less, 1 am not cer- 
tain. 

But the motion may be fast 
enough to avert the final catastro- 
phe. In this respect the energy crisis 
of the winter of 1973-74 performed 
a great service. The crisis was, to a 
great extent, made inevitable by the 
folly of American foreign policy 
since World War 11 (see my article

lime issue o/ Worlds of If! ed. | and 
was exacerbated by the greed of oil 
companies, but underlying every- 
thing is the fact that there is only a 
limited amount of oil in Earth’s oil 
wells and that that limited amount 
is vanishing with frightening ra- 
pidity. 

Nothing has done as much as the 
energy crisis to convince Americans 
that the economic interdependence 
of the world is real and that it in- 
cludes the United States. Nothing 
has done as much to convince 
Americans that our standard of 
living, so much higher than that of 
the rest of the world, is at the mercy 
of the rest of the world. In short, 
nothing has done as much to con- 
vince Americans of the vulnerability 
of the United States. That goes a 
long way toward making world 
government seem less of a dirty 
phrase, since it is now obvious that 
we may have as much to gain from 
a globally-organized economy as to 
give to it. 

To be sure, at the time 1 write, 
the Arab nations have lifted their 
boycott and Americans are doing 
their best to convince themselves 
that, after a three-month night- 
mare, everything is exactly as it 
once was — but that’s a self-delusion 
that cannot be maintained. Oil 
prices have gone up, inflation has 
moved along faster, and the oil in 



the ground is still disappearing. 
The crisis, believe me, is still with 
us and won’t go away, and a certain 
amount of American innocence will 
never return. 

I et us imagine, then, that the 
j Earth continues to move in the 
direction of population control and 
world government and does so 
quickly enough to avert a major 
catastrophe, suffering at most only 
a mild catastrophe. (After a recent 
talk 1 gave at the University of 
Pittsburgh, 1 was asked what I 
meant by “a mild catastrophe”, 
and 1 replied, “One from which 
civilization can recover.”) 

This supposition of fast-enough 
movement may be low- probability 
but perhaps it is not zero-proba- 
bility. Perhaps, under the lash of 
the gathering horror, we will be 
forced, kicking and screaming, into 
survival. 

In that case, here would be the 
situation as Earth enters the 21st 
Century: 

1) World population w ill stand at 
7,000,000,000, but all over the 
world, heroic and successful mea- 
sures will be holding the line, and 
every effort will be made to lower 
the birth rate to the point where the 
population will decline toward an 
ultimate goal of perhaps no more 
than 1,000.000,000. 

2) There will be dreadful short- 
ages of food and raw materials 
generally, but heroic and successful 
measures toward the proper distri- 



IS THERE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE? 



71 



bution of what exists and toward 
efficient methods of re-cycling will 
minimize the more disastrous ef- 
fects of the shortages. 

3) There will still be political 
units of the type with which we are 
familiar, but few decisions of any 
importance will be reached except 
at international conferences. It will 
furthermore be clear that no nation 
can afford to take unilateral action 
against the will of the others. 

I f all this is so. we can work out 
as inevitable corollaries (or inevi- 
table, at least, as long as mankind 
chooses not to choose destruction) a 
number of utopian consequences. 
For instance — 

1. The end of sexism. 

Womankind’s subjection has 
been the natural consequence of 
her role as baby machine. In a 
world of high infant mortality and 
low life expectancy, the need was 
for many babies. It takes many 
babies to have even a few survive, 
and in agricultural economies many 
children mean many hands to help 
with the work. Children are also 
needed to help support aged 
parents in a society that would 
otherwise let them die. (That is the 
significance of the Biblical “Honor 
thy mother and thy father.” It 
doesn’t refer to standing up when 
they come into the room. It means 
supporting them.) 

In the 21st Century, with a very 



low birthrate, with childlessness 
common, and with those children 
which are born very much more the 
responsibility of society in general 
than they are now, women’s role as 
baby machine will have largely dis- 
appeared. 

In that case, what else will 
women have to do? Do you suppose 
they can still be relegated to social 
and economic inferiority; made to 
accept the situation that household 
tasks are peculiarly for the female 
sex; that passivity is the female role 
in sex — in business — in govern- 
ment; that the highest function of 
woman is to support her man in a 
self-effacing manner and that she 
must place her physiological wares 
(but never her intellectual wares) 
constantly on view to catch him in 
the first place and reflect favorably 
on him in the second? 

If this were indeed to be the 
situation, women would be con- 
demned to lives so empty that child- 
bearing and child-rearing would be 
all that could fill them. There 
would then be an enormous ten- 
dency to strive for children under 
any conditions. 

To keep the birthrate success- 
fully low women must be beguiled 
into other activities; what method 
would be so natural and so effective 
as to declare them people — and to 
allow them to enter all facets of 
human endeavor on an equal basis 
with men? 

2. The end of racism. 



72 



GALAXY 



Racism has existed as long as 
mankind, because any slight differ- 
ence marks one as outside-the- 
tribe and therefore as someone to 
be mocked — if mockery is safe — or 
feared, if it is not safe to mock. 
Introduce a new child into a group 
of children and have him wear 
clothes a trifle different in style, or 
speak in a slightly different accent, 
and watch him become marked for 
scapegoating at once. 

It does not matter that the 
clothes may differ in being cleaner, 
or the accent in being more precise, 
the result is the same. The key word 
is not ‘better’, nor is it ‘worse’; it is 
merely ‘different.’ And. of course, 
in the thought-processes of the 
bigot, ‘different’, whatever its na- 
ture, becomes ‘worse.’ 

That is why I am not impressed 
by the attempts of men like Shock- 
ley to argue that Blacks are less in- 
telligent than Whites; that it is the 
natural inferiority of Blacks that 
has caused them to be discriminat- 
ed against, and (by obvious impli- 
cation) that it is for that reason that 
they should continue to be discrimi- 
nated against. 

In the first place, 1 don’t accept 
Shockley’s arguments on intelli- 
gence. I do not believe that intelli- 
gence can as yet be measured, or 
even defined, with sufficient pre- 
cision as to make it possible to di- 
vide humanity into large groups of 
greater or lesser intelligence, with 
the difference just happening to 
coincide with something as irrele- 



vant to intelligence as skin color. 

Nevertheless, // intelligence could 
be defined and measured, and if it 
turned out that Blacks were inferior 
to Whites in intelligence, that 
would still be totally irrelevant to 
the matter of the continued mis- 
treatment of Blacks. It is the differ- 
ence in appearance that triggers the 
bigotry and it would be no less if 
Blacks were more intelligent than 
Whites. 

As a matter of fact, I know of 
minority groups which, in the 
stereotypical minds of bigots, are 
stigmatized as being too intelligent. 
They are “cunning", “shrewd", 
“sly" and, although in a small mi- 
nority, are continually on the point 
of "taking over the country” — if 
they have not indeed already done 
so. And how does Shockley explain 
that? 

— But observe how matters will 
change in the 21st Century; not out 
of the increase of goodness and love 
in the human heart (alas!) but out 
of the pressing necessity for sur- 
vival. 

If population is to be stabilized 
and even forced into a period of 
slow and humane reduction, it can 
only be accomplished by convincing 
humanity that this reduction is not 
an excuse to wipe out some groups 
and perpetuate others. Birth con- 
trol can easily be used for this pur- 
pose, or be suspected of being used 
for this purpose. 

In order for population control to 
work at all. and for mankind to 



IS THERE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE? 



73 



avoid catastrophe, then, all people 
(or at the very least, enough people) 
must be convinced that all groups 
will be respected equally. While 
open bigotry exists, how can people 
be convinced of this? Mankind will 
simply have to school itself to 
assume a virtue if it has it not, and 
pretend to love neighbors and 
fellow-men even when it does not. 
And if the assumption is made long 
enough and the pretense is kept up 
steadily enough, the fact that it is 
merely assumption and pretense 
may eventually be forgotten. 

Of course, you might imagine 
that we needn’t persuade inferior 
people to cut down on their chil- 
dren. Why don’t we just wipe out 
all those high-breeding, low-stan- 
dard people and control the popu- 
lation even more efficiently? That 
might sound nice to you if you’re 
sure that nobody with a plane and a 
bomb is going around considering 
vou inferior, but let’s suppose you 
are on the right side of the gun. 

, It would still not be the right 
side, for the policy of wiping out the 
unworthy would not be merely a 
matter of powerful countries wiping 
out weak ones. Within every coun- 
try, if bigotry rules, there are racial 
and economic groups that would 
seem, to bigots, to be breeding too 
fast and best controlled by death. 
The confusion and chaos that the 
rule of death would then bring 
about would surely dissolve our all- 
too-rickety technological structure, 
bringing it down upon our heads — 



even if we happen to be the ones 
holding all the guns. 

No! If the 21st Century is to work 
at all. it will have to work without 
racism. 

There will be factors that should 
make this easier than we now think 
possible. If technological civiliza- 
tion survives into the 21st Century 
it is quite obvious that computeri- 
zation and automation of society 
will continue to advance. Such ad- 
vance will militate against racism. 

Increasingly, we will be develop- 
ing a society in which unskilled and 
semi-skilled manual and mental 
labor w ill be done by machines and 
there won’t be the economic pres- 
sure to maintain a large supply of 
people under conditions of oppres- 
sion and of carefully-inculcated ac- 
ceptance of inferiority in order that 
these people might be content to 
perform these unskilled and semi- 
skilled tasks at low pay. 

(Naturally, the disappearance of 
such work will make it all the more 
sensible to reduce the population, 
since it will take fewer people to run 
the world.) 

Then, too, advances in com- 
munication — the use of satellites 
bound to each other and to Earth's 
surface by laser beams capable of 
carrying millions of communication 
channels — will knit the entire globe 
into a small community. (“Global 
village" is the term most frequently 
used.) While efficient communica- 
tion is no guarantee of brotherly- 
love, it does make it a little easier to 



74 



GALAXY 



get along with someone you dislike 
if you can at least talk to him. 

The fact that in the 21st Century 
it will be far easier for all people to 
have access to education and to the 
general store of information 
amassed by the species will wipe 
out some of the more obvious and 
fallacious “intellectual" differ- 
ences. 

In a global village there will also 
be an increasing push toward a 
common language. I don’t mean 
necessarily an exclusive common 
language, with all the rich differ- 
ences in language and culture that 
now bless our planet wiped out. Let 
each group have their own langu- 
age and ways, but let each group 
also know some language with 
which they can reach all other 
groups. 

(1 personally favor English as the 
common language, because of its 
great vocabulary and because of its 
already unparalleled widespread 
use — and also because I am a lin- 
guistic-chauvinist pig.) 

The smallness of the world, the 
ease of communication, the equali- 
zing of opportunity, the common 
language — all will act to depress 
the sense of difference and will 
therefore tend to defuse the push 
toward bigotry. 

Even the mere fact of a decreas- 
ing population in a century of con- 
tinuing scientific advance, will 
make bigotry increasingly unpopu- 
lar. The gradual increase in the 
understanding of genetics will make

it clear that, from the standpoint of 
species survival, the greatest asset 
we can have is genetic diversity. 

There are species that are so per- 
fectly adapted to a particular en- 
vironment that they survive virtually 
unchanged for millions and millions 
of years. Such perfect adaptation 
achieves relative genetic uniformity 
and makes those species sharply 
limited in range and at the total 
mercy of the environment. Let the 
favored environment disappear and 
the species lacks the genetic equip- 
ment to survive. 

The genetic diversity of a genera- 
lized species makes it possible for 
that species to adapt this way or 
that and to survive in one form or 
another long after the living fossils 
have met their doom. 



IS THERE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE? 



75 




As the human population de- 
clines, then, there will be consider- 
able concern lest too many genes 
vanish. People generally will then 
hail diversity and be glad that other 
people exist who are different from 
themselves in appearance and abili- 
ties as living proof that the human 
gene pool is still healthily broad. 

3. The end of war. 

Actually, we have already reach- 
ed the end of war, as long as na- 
tional leaders are guided in their 
defcisions by sanity. (That they will 
be so guided is not a foregone con- 
clusion, of course.) 

A nuclear war between the Unit- 
ed States and the Soviet Union is 
clearly mutual suicide as far as the 
two nations are concerned. What’s 
more, it would probably destroy 
our technological civilization gener- 
ally and, through the radiation it 
produced, would seriously compro- 
mise the viability of the planet as a 
whole. 

This almost everybody recog- 
nizes, so the question is whether a 
Ho/z-nuclear war is really possible, 
and the answer is “No!” The 
trouble is that the advance of tech- 
nology has made war into such a 
high-energy game, played with such 
high-sophistication pieces, that no 
one can afford to play anymore. 

Under the best of conditions, war 
is fought with a nation’s surplus 
energy and resources. Or a nation 
can tight a short war even without 



surplus energy and resources in the 
hope of seizing an enemy's energy 
and resources and continuing the 
tight with those. Where no nation 
has surplus energy and resources 
large enough to support the current 
technology of war, the whole pro- 
cess becomes purposeless and a 
mere exercise in suicide, albeit one 
somewhat slower than the nuclear 
variety. 

The most recent war which man- 
aged to last for years and which 
reached a clear-cut decision without 
too badly damaging the victors was, 
of course. World War II. Since 
World War II (thirty years now!) 
there have been two wars that in- 
volved at least one great power 
directly and that lasted for years— 
the Korean War and the Vietnam 
War. 

Both of these wars ended exactly 
where they began. The United 
States had to end each war by deal- 
ing with an enemy whose territorial 
extent, military strength, and po- 
litical nature had not been changed 
by the American effort. All we 
could claim was that the other side 
hadn’t actually won. In each case 
we could have wiped out the enemy 
if we had exerted our maximum 
strength, but in each case we did 
not dare. 

All other wars fought on Earth 
since 1945 have been small-scale, 
or very short, or both. And in no 
case could one of them have pro- 
gressed at all without the support 
given to one side or another by one

NOT JUST ANOTHER SF MAGAZINE! 

Worlds of IF is rowdy, robust fun! 

Worlds of IF is High Adventure 
for High I.Q.'s! 

Worlds of IF is great new SF in the 
Grand Old Tradition! 

Remember the way SF used to be? The sense of wonder- 
crashing suns and exploding galaxies!— that delicious sense of 
derring-do and don’t-give-a-damn of those glorious old pulp 
magazines of yore? Worlds of IF is that way now — only more so! 

Of course the writing quality is infinitely higher than it was 
in 1940, the depth of characterization vastly greater, and s-e-x 
is no longer a four-letter word— but Worlds of IF is definitely 
—and unabashedly!— in the pulp tradition. Pulp raised to a new 
dimension. Pulp gone First Class! 

Sceptical? Well, to prove a point we are making a really 
special offer. Fill in the coupon below— which offers a 12-issue

Name ; 






of the great powers. 

Right now, it takes all the United 
States can spare to support a mili- 
tary force under peacetime condi- 
tions, and no other nation is any 
better off. And as energy supplies 
and material resources decrease, it 
will become more and more diffi- 
cult to afford all those uniforms 
and all that gold-braid. 

In the 21st Century, the nations 
of the world will be forced into 
international cooperation as the 
only way of tackling and defeating 
the problems besetting them, and 
armies will be expensive anachron- 
isms — except, perhaps, as organiz- 
ed labor forces. 

So war will vanish not because of 
a growth of goodness in the human 
heart, or understanding in the 
human mind (would that that were 
so!) but only because war has al- 
ready priced itself out of existence, 
except as a form of world suicide. 

4. The extension of the life-span. 

If our technological civilization 
survives into the 21st Century that 
will mean that medical science has 
continued to advance. 

Increasingly, degenerative and 
metabolic diseases will be success- 
fully treated. Arthritis, cancer, cir- 
culatory disorders may all join the 
various infectious diseases as merely 
minor dangers. 

This means that more and more 
people will reach the age of 70 be- 
fore dying (already in such places 



as Scandinavia half the men and 
slightly more than half the women 
do so.) The 21st Century popula- 
tion will then consist of a greater 
percentage of old people than now 
exists in the population and (thanks 
to birth control) a considerably 
smaller percentage of young people. 

Gerontology — the medical study 
of the phenomena of old age — will 
therefore become the most impor- 
tant medical specialty, both be- 
cause of a plethora of cases and a 
fall-off in the importance of other 
specialties. 

Until today, all that medical ad- 
vance has done is to make it pos- 
sible for more men and women to 
grow old. This is not to be sneered 
at, of course, and 1 am personally 
delighted with even such limited 
progress since it won’t be long till 
I’ll be passing out of late youth and 
into very early middle age myself. 

Still, once a person reaches 70, 
he or she is old — as old today as he 
or she would have been if he or she 
had performed the much more dif- 
ficult task of running the gauntlet 
of disease and misery, to reach the 
age of 70 in Homer’s time. 

Old age is sometimes said to be 
just one more disease, but if so, it is 
a disease different from all others, 
since it alone seems to be inevitable 
and inescapable. There is logical 
reason to suppose that old age* is 
built into the genes. Cells from 
human embryonic tissue, even when 
given an idyllic, protected environ- 
ment and supplied with ample 



78 



GALAXY 



nourishment, divide more and more 
slowly as time goes on, and after 
some fifty divisions — divide no 
more. 

The cells run down; their divi- 
sions eventually stop; they die and 
are not replaced; and the whole in- 
tricate machinery of the body fal- 
ters, then grinds to a halt. The 
running down may be through the 
accumulation of errors as genes re- 
plicate time after time; or through 
the slow accumulation of waste 
products; or through the slow de- 
terioration of protein molecules. 

Whatever it is, it seems to be pro- 
grammed in the start. And we can 
see why this should be so. 

After all, each new child is born 
with a brand-new gene combination 
to be tested for its survival value. 
Each new child is a new throw of 
the evolutionary dice, a new turn of 
the wheel. In order to assure the 
necessary sorting and re-sorting of 
the new, so that the species can be 
always adjusted to better fit an old 
environment or to come to fit a new 
one. the old must be taken off the 
stage. The existence of death by old 
age. which makes certain this re- 
moval even when all other causes of 
death fail, encourages and speeds 
evolution. It hastens and strength- 
ens the development of the species 
at the cost of the individual. 

But whatever the cause of old age 
and however programmed that 
cause might be. could it not be re- 
versed, as biologists learn more and 
more about the intimate details of 



cellular biophysics and biochemis- 
try, and learn also how to manipu- 
late those details? 

Might not old age be prevented 
for a time, or reversed to a degree, 
and might not people live for two 
centuries rather than one and re- 
main young through most of the 
doubled life-span? Might they not 
live longer still? Might they not be 
potentially immortal — or at least 
have the option of living until they 
voluntarily choose to die? 

Perhaps! It may be that the 21st 
Century, while it sees the popula- 
tion decreasing steadily, will also 
see the individual life-span increas- 
ing steadily (and therefore making 
necessary a still further drop in the 
birth-rate.) 

But in that case will not the ex- 
tended life-span and the ever slower 
addition of new babies to the 
species slow human evolution and 
endanger human survival in the 
long run? 

Yet who is to say that evolution 
must proceed only by that mechan- 
ism which has. in fact, been used 
through all the billions of years of 
life on Earth? So far, evolution has 
been carried on by random gene- 
combinations-and-rccombinations; 
by random gene-mutations-and- 
new-combinations — and by an end- 
less epidemic of random death to 
make sure of an endless turnover of 
generations with their new gene- 
combinations. 

Now, after three billion years, we 
have on Earth, a species which is. 



IS THERE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE? 



79 



for the first time, potentially cap- 
able of directing its own evolution. 

Perhaps the 21st Century will see 
the beginning of something new 
under the sun; something radically 
different — a species more stable 
than any other that has ever exist- 
ed; one with individuals that endure 
far longer and remain far less af- 
fected by the passing of the years; 
one that accumulates wisdom and 
experience in each individual to an 
enormous extent; and one that 
guides its own evolutionary destiny 
across the very slow heart-beat of 
generations through thoughtful ge- 
netic engineering rather than by 
random death. 

5. The expansion of man’s range. 

If we imagine the triumph of 
genetic engineering, we can, if we 
choose to adopt the pessimistic 
view, picture mankind as consisting 
of a limited number of very old, 
very tired individuals, who for 
centuries have not had a new 
thought. You might see mankind 
turning from physiological death 
merely to find a new and infinitely 
more horrible intellectual death. 

Even if we discount genetic engi- 
neering and immortality, and sup- 
pose that death will always hold its 
sway over mankind, we might still 
picture the 21st Century as the 
century-of-the-middle-aged, since 
there are bound to be more old 
people and fewer young people. 



Might not the generally older popu- 
lation be stodgier, more conserva- 
tive, more unoriginal, more unin- 
novative than we are today? 

We might even argue that in the 
21st Century mankind will have 
learned the lesson of the 20th 
Century (or civilization will not 
have survived.) In the 21st Century, 
people will know that indiscrimi- 
nate growth is no longer possible. 
They will know that they cannot 
consume and pollute at will. They 
will know that everything will have 
to be recycled as far as possible and 
that every new advance, every 
change, will have to be closely 
examined for side-effects. 

Conservatism will, of necessity, 
be built into 21st Century society 
and that great and heroic dash into 
the unknown will be forever gone. 
What will be left will be the life of 
the sloth, which, hanging suspend- 
ed, moves each limb slowly forward 
and tests the branch carefully be- 
fore gradually shifting its weight. 

This is what we must look for- 
ward to. Or is it? 

We can, of course, argue the 
point. Are old people really stodgier 
and more conservative than young? 
In societies in which the proper 
attention is paid to the old, and 
which are not as youth-worshipping 
as our own is today, might it not 
turn out that the old are as innova- 
tive as the young? 

Suppose, though, we don’t argue 
the point. Suppose that we are 
threatened with an innate conser- 



80 



GALAXY 



vatism and the death of daring. Is 
there any way it can be fought? 

What we need is a horizon to be 
passed, a limit to be penetrated. Of 
course, there will always be hori- 
zons and limits in the intellectual 
world — and the great battle against 
the unknown will never be over. 
But this is an ethereal battle and 
one which may not catch the imagi- 
nation of humanity as a species. 

What we need is something phy- 
sical and visible — and surely that 
we have. When the last horizon on 
Earth has contracted to zero and 
the last limit has vanished, there re- 
mains an unimaginably vast Uni- 
verse beyond the Earth. 

In the 21st Century, space ex- 
ploration and space colonization 
will become not merely a matter of 
scientific curiosity but will be some- 
thing necessary to keep alive that 
vital spark of daring in mankind. 
And in adopting an exercise to 
insure the survival of the spirit of 
humanity we will also gain in other 
important ways. 

On the Moon, a colony could 
take advantage of the Moon’s en- 
vironment; its airlessness, its ex- 
tremes of temperature, its hard 
radiation, to gain knowledge and to 
develop industrial finesse that 
would be difficult or impossible to 
accomplish on Earth. 

In addition, a Lunar colony, to 
survive, would have to do so in an 
environment even more restrictive 
than that of Earth, and thus could 
serve as an example to be followed. 



The Moon could easily be the 
school of Earth. 

Then, too, it may be only by way 
of a Moon colony that mankind can 
explore the rest of the Universe. 

The Moon is easy to reach — it is 
only three days away even by the 
primitive space technology of today. 
To reach any sizeable body of the 
Solar system beyond the Moon will, 
however, take anywhere from 
months to decades; and to reach 
even the nearer stars will take from 
decades to centuries. To imagine 
Earthmen forsaking Earth for years 
of lifetimes in a constricted space- 
ship is to imagine too much, 
perhaps. 

To be sure, the Earth is itself a 
spaceship, but an atypical one. It is 
the kind of spaceship in which the 
life-support system and the crew 
cling to the outside of the hull, 
having grown so used to this that 
life within the hull is difficult to 
adjust to. 

On the other hand, a Moon 
colony can only exist in caverns be- 
neath the surface; that would be in 
a typical spaceship environment. 
For a group of Moon colonists to 
get into a spaceship and venture 
farther out into space for years at a 
time would be far easier, psycholo- 
gically, than for Earthmen to do so. 
To the Moon-colonists, the space- 
ship would be much more nearly 
like home. 

And if the time comes when large 
ships are built that are capable of 
supporting an ecologically-indepen- 



IS THERE HOPE FOR THE FUTURE?

dent human society over the gener- 
ations (as in Heinlein’s "Universe”) 
then surely it will not be Earthmen 
but the Moon colonists — or their 
descendants, the people of the 
hollowed-out asteroids — who will 
serve as the crew. 

In fact, we might imagine the 
asteroids themselves, after having 
been inhabited for a greater or 
lesser time, turned into spaceships, 
driven out of their orbits by some 
advanced space-drive, and launch- 
ed beyond the Solar system and 
into the depths of space. In that 
case, there would be no psycholo- 
gical difficulty worth mentioning. 
The crew would be staying at home. 

So however stodgy Earth may get 
(and 1 insist that it may not get 
stodgy) there will always be the es- 
cape-valve of space exploration and 
the 21st Century may witness the 
beginning of the expansion of man- 
kind's range — an expansion with- 
out limit. 

People from Earth may some- 
times qualify to emigrate to the 
Moon; people from the Moon may 
sometimes qualify to emigrate to 
one or another of the asteroids; 
people from the asteroids may 
sometimes choose to launch them- 
selves into interstellar space. 

The net result will be that the 
Galaxy, and, indeed, all the gal- 
axies. will be opened, in the long 
run, to human beings and to their 
descendants (proliferating into 
many para-human species.) Out in 
space, humanity in all its varieties 



may meet and mingle with non- 
human intelligences, so that we will 
no longer be alone. 

What’s more, if tachyons do exist 
and if we can bend them to our 
will — or in some other way get 
around the speed-of-light limit — we 
may even end with the kind of Ga- 
lactic Empire dreamed of by myself 
(if mankind is the only intelligent 
species in the Galaxy) or by E. E. 
Smith (if it is not.) 



I et’s summarize, then. The im- 
j mediate future looks dark. 
Civilization may not survive the 
crisis that is upon us. 

If, however, we can shift quickly 
enough in the direction of popula- 
tion control and world-government 
and can hang on for thirty years, 
the long-range future — within the 
later life time of the young people 
alive today — can be made incred- 
ibly bright. 

We will then have a 21st Century 
that will be the dream of an older 
generation of science fiction writers 
(writing prior to the current fashion 
of darkness and doom) come true. 
Imagine a world, in which the 
scourge of war is eliminated and 
the horrors of sexism and racism 
wiped out, in which lives are ex- 
panded and enriched, and in which 
all of space is opened to us. 

If only we can get through this 
crisis —

I hate it when my eyes bleed. So 
many of my windows are already 
blind. It’s not fair, not fair ... so 
fair and foul a life I have not lived. 

WE has bandaged the eyes. The 
dressing is cool. Now, in this dark- 
ness, h 9 w privileged I am to cogi- 
tate undistracted, am I not. Before 
I die I will have been able to think 
three lifetimes’ worth of thoughts, 
since I need waste no time getting 
and spending, minding my busi- 
ness. I have no business. No doubt 
this makes me a philosopher . 
WE is afraid to massage me when 
my eyes are bleeding. My capil- 
laries are too delicate for almost 
any touch; hence this tank in which 
I pass my days, my nights, my twilit 
life. They have arranged it so 
nicely. My tank is operated by the 
hospital’s MEDIC — Monitoring 

ElectroDiagnostic InterCom — and 
I recline in fluid, all my physical re- 
quirements met by machinery. The 
walls of the tank are lined with 
panels fitted for me to call to myself 
the library, television, vidphone. 
Books appear at my command on 
my overhead screen, unrolling their 
contents at the speed I choose with 
a wave of the hand ; . 

I watch the world play games. 
Getting and spending. 1 marvel at 
my race. Such ingenuity and energy 
transparently devoted to acquisi- 
tion. Television shows me gestures, 
black pawns, white knights, piling 
up inconsequentially at the sides of 
an incomprehensible chessboard. 

1 play with Mikhail in Bulgaria. 



He wishes very much to beat me, 
since this would qualify him for a 
championship game. I do not think 
he will. His play is falling off lately. 
He dreams of capturing a Queen, 
one Sophia, and is distracted. I 
would prefer that he talk to me of 
Sophia anyway; there are others 
with whom to play at chess, but not 
so many will talk of love. I have 
read a great deal about that. Mik- 
hail has shown me her picture on 
the screen, a small wiry female, not 
interesting. She is a mechanic . 
What is this experience that takes 
no account of minds? He will get 
his Sophia and they will copulate 
often for a while. And then? What 
exchange of spirit takes place be- 
tween a player of the Game and a 
wielder of wrenches? 

She will tighten him in armor 
and seal the joints . Mikhail 
walks in his village. He wanted to 
take me with him, but it is forbid- 
den in his country to carry a 
camera . Everyone has some- 
thing to hide. 

WE is back again. I hear the 
food tray rattling. The teeth have 
been a great problem. Chewing is 
too much strain on the blood 
vessels, and of course they cannot 
be repaired or removed the usual 
ways. I am fed with liquids, and 
WE washes the teeth religiously, 
chemicals are given in my diet and 
in the fluid around me. Since the 
teeth do not wear down they are 
long, in spite of exercise so that the 
lips do not quite close at rest. I re-

member the uproar there was about 
my milk teeth. Fortunately they fell 
out without blood, but late. Was I 
about twelve years when the first 
ones left me? 1 don’t know . 

I believe this food tastes of real 
food. WE tells me what we are eat- 
ing — boeuf bourguignonne, salmon 
mayonnaise, so on, blended and 
strained. 1 ought to think this very 
kind of Them. I am aware that 
liquid hospital diets normally con- 
sist of soybeans and milk, monoto- 
nous and poorly flavored. I am 
quite the gourmet ... 1 suppose 
WE is telling me the truth. I am so 
much in the dark. 

1 must be very expensive. They 
play a game of economics in which 
I am a pawn. How is it that I am 
both cherished and forgotten? . 
I do not like to miss the news. WE 
has turned on the sound forme . 
The Americans have taken Q4 in 
Southeast Asia, lost KB5. Four 
hundred and twenty-five black 
pawns off the board. Morison has 
broken the three-minute mile. That 
must have given him great plea- 
sure. Maas has won the European 
election in Brussels; the lira de- 
valued again; dock strikes. British 
Geisha girls in great demand in 
Brazil. The Japanese training 
school in Leeds seems to be a suc- 
cess . 

Under the spreading chestnut 
tree 

The sleeping serpent lies 

Ask not to whom, he lies to thee 

Tis folly to be wise . 



I do not enjoy being myself. It is 
too difficult — all this frenzied ac- 
tivity, all this involvement which 1 
can only watch. I cannot care. 1 am 
broken with longing. 1 weep into 
my bath tears and blood. This con- 
dition is not life. 1 imagine myself 
with a great black beard, punching 
at men, scratching art my matted 
chest, crouching hungrily over a 
woman. The image remains pic- 
torial. It has no life. I touch my 
body, like a woman’s, soft, hair- 
less, scarred. Was I born to give 
employment to nurses? ... I should 
have died heretofore. I am not a 
survival type. Yet God in His in- 
finite wisdom has caused this — I — 
to exist. Am I a parasite on a long- 
aborted project contiguously rotting 
in a celestial wastebin? One day I 
must decide this. It haunts me. If I 
exist for a purpose there is reality in 
wrong and right. If, on the other 
hand, this is a mess of accidental 
pollution in which I find myself, 
there is no right, and perhaps I do 
not exist at all. I have no way to 
test. I can commit no action, make 
no decision. When I become eigh- 
teen I could vote. It does not seem 
sufficient. All is out of my hands. I 
judge my fellow man who is not my 
fellow. I think I am not a man at 
all ... I cannot define myself .

terrupting my meditations.

My head ached. The thought of 
colors sent a jagged pain across my 
skull. One must maintain one’s 
manners. 

“Thanks.” 1 could smell the em- 
barrassment on him. Only lately 
had I persuaded him that I really 
wanted to know what his life looked 
like — outside, a normal life. He 
didn’t believe me; or possibly he 
did not want to show me how it 
was. 

“Sorry, I can’t look at them to- 
day. What are they?" 

“Oh, nothing much. Me and Sue 
went to the lake over the weekend. 
That’s all.” 

“Great. Lots of flesh?” 

“Yards. We gpt hold of a sand- 
glider.” 

Poor David. With anybody else 
he would have been able to convey 
it all with few words and many ges- 
tures. For me he had to wrestle with 
description instead of his natural 
vocabulary of "man . .” and “you 
know . .” With me he was up 
against my lack of referents. I tried 
to put him at ease, but it was hard 
going. 

“How was the surf?” 

"Oh, man, rolling in like shit.” 

Now there was an image. He 
caught my flickering smile and 
burst out laughing. 

"Sorry, rafiki, I meant big, high 
waves, a lot of action.” 

“Sure. Did Sue like it?” 

See what I mean, man. 1 fed him 
meaningless questions; he shuffled 
his feet uneasily. I could imagine 



him standing a few feet away, 
bounding with energy, eager to be 
out doing something — swimming, 
making out (whatever that convey- 
ed to him), running. 

"Did that thing. Really turned 
her over." I could almost hear his 
reminiscent flush. 1 gave up the in- 
terrogation. 

“Thank you for stopping by, and 
the pictures. I'll see them soon.” 
“Cheer up. Maybe they’ll let me 
bring Sue some time.” 

Let him? No doubt she was beat- 
ing at the doors to get to me. 

"Fine. Good-bye.” His footsteps 
left me far more eagerly than they 
had entered. Once more I wondered 
why he kept on visiting me. Ever 
since I could remember David was 
there every few days. When we were 
children we played checkers and 
cards. It was strange — an active 
healthy boy wrapped in sterile 
white gown and mask, playing in- 
doors with an invalid, sharing 
nothing but an electronic checker- 
board. Once I had asked him, 
“David, do any of the other chil- 
dren you know visit the hospital?” 
“Sure.” 

“But usually they visit their 
family, or friends from school or 
their playmates, don’t they?” 

“I guess so." 

“Do you know anybody else like 
me, who stays here all the time?” 
“Well, I don't know.” 

“You mean no." 

“Yeah.” 

“Wouldn’t you rather be out

playing ball?” I had persisted. 

1 wished 1 could see more of his 
face. The mask showed only per- 
plexed blue eyes. He had to think. 

“I like to play this too." he said. 
Neat but evasive. And the eyes had 
turned wistfully toward the window 
for a moment. 

As the years passed I gave up try- 
ing to find out whether he was 
under some commandment or had 
peculiar taste in recreation, and ac- 
cepted his visits as I accepted those 
of the medical people. 1 must have 
been very slow to make the connec- 
tion but one day 1 had realized that 
David’s name was the same as my 
doctor's. If he were coming under 
orders from his father, I could 
understand that. It wasn’t David’s 
charity; Luther was always thinking 
of ways to entertain me. If David 
was therapy prescribed by my 
doctor, well and good. 1 rather en- 
joyed despising him, if the truth 
were known. 

I could hardly recall my parents. 
Luther was the nearest I had to 
family. I believed my parents had 
had no other children; only I, the 
sea-corpse. It would tend to have 
discouraged them. 

David grew a beard this year. I 
have seen his whole face on the 
closed circuit screen, and in photo- 
graphs. He looks like an advertise- 
ment for something young, soft 
drinks or sports equipment. Be- 
tween his sunburnt ears, solid 
vacuum. 

I heard the trolley at the door. I 



knew what was coming. Sleep ther- 
apy. WE sprayed the room with 
something or other, turned a dial 
on the tank’s console and put on a 
recording to whose sound I was ex- 
pected to fall asleep. Sometimes it 
was a hypnotist or relaxation rou- 
tine, or reading, or music. The en- 
cyclopedia had not worked, it was 
far too interesting. Here we go. 
Good God, who thought this one 
up? It’s Titus Groaned. Goodnight 
all. It’s been such a busy day . 

In the morning the bandages 
were off. The sunlight outside was 
dazzling. I probed for the head- 
ache; in hiding. Good. The world 
outside the especially large window 
was bright and rain-new. Blind 
days were a mixed curse; I had 
looked out at my view for years, 
and each time my sight returned it 
was original again. 

In the distance lay a heap of 
hills, often hazy, sometimes clear 
and furred with woodland. There 
was a streak of silvery water, part of 
a lake, fed by a slender waterfall 
that I could see with binoculars 
from the tank. On the right, a crag 
of sedimentary rock heaved vertical 
by some geological experience 
changed color in varying light, the 
trapped pebbles and mica changing 
the texture from minute to minute. 
On the left were layers of red and 
yellow rock, pleasingly symmetri- 
cal. There was a fall of foliage be- 
tween the rocks, a birch grove, and 
near it a house whose occupants I 
sometimes watched hanging out

laundry, playing with their pony 
and dogs. 

Just outside the window were the 
hospital gardens. I could see pa- 
tients wheeling or wandering along 
the paths, taking the air, some- 
times with nurses in attendance. 
The window faced southwest; they 
gave me sunsets almost all year. 

“Well, Philip, how are you to- 
day?” Dr. Alfiere surveyed the 
mass of dials and gauges above the 
tank. Now that he had taught me to 
read them in the wall mirror 1 often 
noted my own condition and waited 
to see if he agreed. “Hmmm. Yes. 
Headache gone?” 

“Think so.” 

“Sorry about the bad day yester- 
day.” 

“They come. At least MEDIC 
cuts down the pain.” 

"It’s a great machine. Marvelous 
saving on staff time.” 

“1 appreciate that.” 

He glanced at me sharply, closed 
his notebook, hesitated. 

“Anything you want today?” 
“Dancing girls?" 

No one knew better than he how 
phony that line was. 

“Tomorrow. How’s your German 
coming along?” 

"Aufrichtig, mochte schon wider

In diesen Mauern, diesen Hallen 
Will cs mir keineswegs gefallen. 
Es ist ein gar beschrankter Raum

He winced. “I suppose you would 
quote that one. Even Goethe knew 
about the walls closing in . your 
accent needs work.” In medicine 
we treat symptoms, not meanings. 

He moved diagonally across the 
floor. That pleased me. The white 
bishop ... or the black. 

“Doc?” 

“Yes?” 

“What am I going to do with my 
life?" 

He sat heavily in the visitors’ 
chair. 

“You all struggle to keep me go- 
ing. To what end? Am I supposed 
to be grateful?” 

He closed his eyes, sitting quite 
still. 

“Yes.” 

“You function, maintaining me. 
I survive so that you may do so. It’s 
not good enough. Not for me. For 
you there are other patients. I do 
not choose to live in order to feed 
your purpose.” 

“It’s not for you to choose, 
Philip.” 

“Who, then? Am I your prop- 
erty?” 

“Your life is your property as 
much as anyone’s is. No one 
chooses to be born, or in what 
body. I am only a mechanic to your 
body, boy. What you make of your 
life is up to you.”

“What can I make of it like 
this?” I asked bitterly. 

“What would you make of it like 
me, or like David? The real exis- 
tence occurs within yourself.” 

All right, all right. More evasion. 
He had people to love, presumably, 
and work to do. He was of use to his 
patients. I withdrew my attention. 
He left quietly. 

MEDIC? 

— I am attending. It is time for 
your lesson. Guten Morgen, Mein

"Nein, ich will nicht. " 

— It was your wish to study at

“My wish? I do not choose to.” 

— Repeat that in German, if you 
please. Wollen Sie nicht Deutsch

“Nein. I exercise choice. I will 
not.” 

— Very well. For what purpose 
did you address me. Is there some- 
thing else you would care to do in- 
stead. — So spake my slave; my 
wish its command, my comfort its 
desideratum. 

“I have no purpose. What is it to 
care?” 

— One: to have or show regard, 
interest or concern as respecting 
some other person, thing or event. 
Two: to be wishful or inclined. 
That is the sense in which I used 
the word . Three: to mind or be con- 
cerned, harbor an objection. To

"Oh, shut up. Meaningless 
noise.” 



There was silence. My adrenalin 
level was rising. 1 was angry; I har- 
bored objections. I breathed deeply 
in an effort to calm myself. 1 
wrestled to contain my rage, all my 
attention centered on restraining 
my body from flinging itself bruis- 
ingly, violently against the walls of 
the tank, pain to forget pain .

“Living is medically inadvisable

“Are they indeed! You are a ma-

— That is so. —

gram, doc? In the needle, in the

sea of tranquility closed over my 
head. 

“Philip, you must not get so ex- 
cited. You simply must not,” he 
said excitedly. 

My fury had contracted to a cold 
hard marble on the moon. I asked 
dully, from my head, “What are 
you afraid will happen? Will I 
black out, collapse, what?” 

“Look, Philip, you have been 
told over and over that your blood 
pressure must remain even, your 
temperature constant.” 

“Suppose it doesn’t? Suppose I 
get up and out of this tank and 
climb out the window and howl?” 
“I don’t know what would 
happen to you.” 

“Would I die, put you out of a 
job?” 

“You might.” 

I stared at him, unfocused, 
vague. I dozed. Later, in my think- 
tank. MEDIC? 

— I am attending. — 

“You are a tattletale.” 

— I am a medical instrument. I 
exist to preserve and protect human

We have been over this before.

lism and growth, reproduction and 
internally initiated adaptations to

“That hardly describes me.” 

— You exist. You metabolize. 
You are adapted sufficiently to 



your environment or you would 
not. — 

“I may not exist. Only I can 
judge that. And this environment is 
adapted to me.” 

— That is so. You are neverthe- 
less conscious and alive. You are a 
male human, a man. — 

“And reproduction?” 

— You are genetically capable. — 
“What the hell good is that?” 
— It enables the definition to 
apply.— 

Never argue with a computer. 
They think in circles. I cannot ima- 
gine what it is like to want to repro- 
duce: MEDIC probably has strong- 
er feelings on the matter than I. 
But I wish I knew. 

MEDIC? 

— I am attending. — 

“You need a haircut.” 

That one took him thirty seconds 
to figure out. 

— You joke. That is good. I am 
glad you are merry. — 

I swear he was made in Ger- 
many. 



O utside in the garden it was 
visiting hour. People were 
standing in small groups around 
the patients who sat pale in chairs. 
Wives, husbands, children, friends; 
all the constellations of the 
damned. People who had come 
from home and would soon be 
home again. 

Someone said, “Hello." The door 
shut behind a visitor.

“I’m Sue. David’s friend. I 
sneaked in.” 

Sneaked in? Past Cerberus and 
Charon? They had forgotten to 
code the door. 

“Hello, Sue,” I said. She wore a 
non-regulation garment, not white, 
not loose. Bright blue, fitted 
closely. Her body flowed sinuous 
and disturbing, unexpected musical 
forms and curves. Her uncovered 
face showed tan skin, tawny hair, 
dark lashes around tan eyes. 

“You weren’t expecting me, I 
guess. David said you didn’t.” 

“No,” I said. “I am surprised. 
But you are very welcome.” 

"Man, you do talk like a book,” 
she said smiling. 

Needled, I remarked that well, 
David certainly did not, and would 
she care to be seated. She only 
grinned and looked up at the read- 
out panel. 

“Crikey, is that all you? It looks 
like a spaceship control room. Can 
you understand it? Don’t you know 
if you feel ill?” 

I opened my mouth to reply. 

"I suppose it gives you pills or 
whatever. Do you take pills? Or all 
injections? Can you move in there? 
Whoops, you’re bare naked!” She 
had sped around the room twice 
during this monologue, touching 
things here and there lightly. 

“What a lovely view! Nice of 
them. David says you can read 
books if they go on the shelf under 
the table . oh, I see . can you 
see that?”

I switched on the reader. She had 
placed her hand on the book shelf 
and a huge image of it appeared on 
the ceiling screen. 

"Look up there,” I said, pointing. 

“Hey, bilious!” She began doing 
a peculiar exercise. Fascinated, 1 
watched her contort her body so 
that her head rested upon the plate. 
Her image appeared overhead t 
laughing. 

“There!” she said. “Live from 
Room 602!” She extended her 
tongue, crossed her eyes, wiggled 
her nose. 

“Ouch, 1 can’t stay like this. 
That's fun. Would you like a book 
now?” 

"No, oh, no. Thanks.” 

“What would you like? Shall 1 
sing to you?” 

1 said hesitantly, “If you would 
be so kind . .” 

“There you go again. I’ll have to 
teach you to talk easy.” 

She tried to open the window, 
found it locked, wrenched it loose 
and threw it wide. Strange odorous 
wind slapped my dazed face, for- 
bidden and delicious. She leaned 
out, groped for something and 
straightened up with a musical in- 
strument — a violoncello? — in her 
hand, started to shut the window. 
Then she seemed to read my 
thought before 1 knew it myself and 
left the window ajar. She could not 
have known that the lock was stiff 
with disuse. 

"Will they hear? Will it disturb 
anyone?” 



“I don’t care,” I said recklessly. 
“Never mind them.” 

She sat on the chair with the in- 
strument and stroked the strings. A 
lute. I was used to professional en- 
tertainers on the television, and to 
recordings. I had certain expecta- 
tions. 

This was different. Her voice was 
small, with a slight breathiness in 
the upper registers. The song was a 
ballad, the words of which suggest- 
ed certain Elizabethan lyrics. But 
as she went over the golden brown 
fruitlike instrument, vibrant with 
color, friendly and actual, my nose 
stung and water slid down my 
cheek. 

She stopped. “Man, you must be 
hyper. It’s a silly song, really.” 

“It wasn’t the song. It was — I 
don’t know — I think it is the first 
time anyone sang to me. Just to me, 
really, I mean.” 

Suddenly I realized how difficult 
it was to find words, speaking 
aloud. I had become inarticulate. 

“Oh.” She sounded shocked, 
then — was it pity? “I’m sorry.” 
“You see, they don't let anyone 
in here without covering them with 
masks and gowns, and they disin- 
fect everything." 

"Oh, no!" She scrambled to her 
feet. “I may have done something 
awful to you. I’d better go, quick.” 
She backed toward the door. “I 
didn’t know . .’’ 

"1 don’t care,” I said. “What- 
ever happens, it was worth it. Don’t 
go, please.”

“I’ll come again, I promise. Only 
I'll do it right next time.” 

“I don’t think they can disinfect 
you," I said, almost to. myself. She 
hummed with dangerous things. 

She peered cautiously around the 
door and slipped out. Her head re- 
appeared; she whipped back and 
shut the telltale window. 

“Kwa Heri. I’ll see you,” she 
whispered. 

“Thank you,” I whispered back. 

I wondered if my head ached. 1 
could not be sure. 

The human female familiar to 
me was dressed in a starched noisy 
uniform and grammatically shared 
all experience with me. WE ate, 
bathed, slept. Other aspects of the 
human female were internal anat- 
omy, front, rear side, and cross sec- 
tion, external form dictated by 
musculature within. Hair follicles, 
consisting of epithelial layers and 
oblong, polyhedral and downwardly 
imbricated cell layers, connective 
tissue, controlled by the arrector 
pili — a glistening rain of amber 
satin ... I'd had no idea. 

No one came in to see if I had 
come unglued. Therefore she had 
not been caught. 

She was the only real thing I had 
ever seen. 



I lfiere's eyes were focused on 
^ the ampoule. 

“Doc?” 

“Mmmm?" 

“Still no hope?” 



“You probably know better than 
I. You read all the journals.” 
‘‘What about that vaccine of 
MacReady’s?” 

“Oh, Philip, you don’t have can- 
cer. Hold still . there ... if we 
were to give you anything that 
hadn't been tested and retested and 
tested again it could throw you off 
balance yet again. Don’t you re- 
member how long it took to get this 
far? ... no, 1 suppose you don’t.” 
“If you’d let me see my case his- 
tory ...” 

“You know better than that.” 
He stood, what 1 could see of his 
face showing worry and sympathy, 
his hands resting on the edge of the 
tank. 

“Well, how long did it take?” 
‘‘Years. You kept going into 
shock; we barely managed to save 
you each time. If it hadn’t been for 
Luther, who knew your case so 
well . you kept losing your ability

we got past that. But you are not a 
subject for experiment." 

"For God’s sake, Alfiere! Why 
did they save me?” 

He didn’t reply. Always evasions. 
MEDIC tuned out whenever 1 tried 
to get at my records. My symptoms 
resembled those found in hereditary 
disorders. My parents were dead, 
why couldn’t they tell me? My 
mother had vanished forever into 
this very hospital before I came 
here, when Luther was taking care 
of me at home. My father had died

afterwards in a car accident. They 
were beyond my reach of question- 
ing or blame. Luther was dead. 
Whose pawn was 1? 

The news program flickered 
soundlessly. The same scenes over 
and over again, soldiers, victims, 
smiles. The pawns of Asia had 
nothing to do with me. 1 swam in 
my amniotic fluid, a distorted fetus 
thrust back again and again into 
the womb. 1 hated him; he would 
not let me be born. 



UIJ 0 w did y° u Sue?” said 
JJ^David. 

“Lovely. You're a lucky man.” 

“Yeah," he said, suddenly un- 
comfortable. “How you doing?” 

“As ever.” 1 didn’t really want to 
talk about Sue. 

“Doc says you been restless. 
What does that mean?" 

“1 don’t know. I’m' the same as 
usual.” 

“Okay, okay.” He made a sooth- 
ing. or suppressive, gesture with his 
hand. "We’re going up to the shore 
for a few days." 

“Have a good time. 1 want to 
sleep now.” 

“Nakwenda, rafiki. I’ll go quiet- 
ly-" 

1 had dreamed her. Oh. Lord, 
send me such dreams. Gone away 
docs not matter for dreams. 

It did matter. 

Mikhail called. He had lost his 
game. He was blissful: they were 
sending him to work on a farm with 



Sophia. He thanked me for my 
help. He was happy, preoccupied. 
Good-bye. 

Tomorrow my eyes would bleed. 
The scars on my body would weep. 
And my windows would be blind 
again. 

T he birch leaves turned golden. 

Patients in the garden began 
appearing in sweaters. 1 watched 
rain slide down the glass and 
listened to the scurrying hospital 
sounds. My blood pressure remain- 
ed steady, my heart muttered on, 
my German accent improved. My 
dreams were brightly blue. I read 
little and forgot to watch the news. 
Waiting. 

She came again, shrouded in 
white linen, as cold as the grave, 
masked. 

“Hello," she said, reserved. The 
sharp streaks of vividness she had 
left in my dead air faded in the pre- 
sence of this blank WE creature. 
We stared at one another over a 
wall of gauze. Pyramus and Thisbe. 

“They’re pretty stuffy here, 
aren’t they?” she said. "They 
wouldn’t even let me bring the lute. 
1 had some dawa for you and 1 
thought they’d go into orbit.” 
“Dawa?" I was puzzled. 

“In Swahili, it’s medicine. Here 
it’s stuff to make you feel good. 1 
didn’t bring smokes, 1 thought you 
probably couldn’t. But dawa never 
hurt anybody.” 1 remembered now, 
there were advertisements for some 
such thing, all with pictures of

Davids and Sues looking dreamily 
pleased. 

"Thank you. It was kind of you 
lo try." 

"They sure made a furor," she 
| said. The starch in the white gown 
! made her uncomfortable. It must 
be that. It was too quiet. 1 was help- 
i less; this was a social situation, new 
and fearsome. She would leave, 
[ bored, and 1 would resume count- 
ing the slow minutes of my progress 
toward death. 1 had read about this 
anguish. 1 could hardly ask her to 
dance; 1 could think of nothing to 
say. Could I tell her she exalted and 
terrified me? Could 1 tell her that 
the lines-of-all-directions in which 
she moved had described a new 
universe in my roomworld, that she 
‘ had made me maladjusted, rest- 
L less, that I felt the wings of a great 
1 bird unfolding within me — 1 who 
must never hatch? We stared in 
silence. Now she would say well-uh, 
like David, and melt away, and I 
would try to reseal myself in my 
[ broken eggshell. The moment went 
• on and on, frozen in no-time. It was 
stalemate, no move possible. 1 
wished she would spit out her 
well-uh and end it, but she rested 
inside that moment. The clock 
I moved jerkily through no-time, the 
non-mdment, as she reposed within 
it. relaxed, possessed of it. If no- 
time were of no moment to her I 
would try in my despair to follow 
her into it. Slowly, 1 felt the rigidity 
of my fear as if it were a solid object 
and as 1 recognized it, it separated 



from me and merged gradually into 
the no-time, no longer frozen, but 
still. What she would do was of no 
importance. In now-time, we ac- 
quiesced. 

Time resumed. 

“That's better,” she said. I was 
enriched and baffled. What had 
happened? But I had lost my fear 
for the time being. “What had you 
in sueh a state?" 

"You,” I said without difficulty. 
"I was afraid you would go.” 

She smiled. "1 brought a song for 
you, that’s why I was sorry I 
couldn’t get the lute in here. You 
seemed to like it before." 

“Couldn’t you sing a capellu?" 

"What?" 

“Without accompaniment." 

"Oh, yes, sure.” She prowded the 
room, looking for the right place, 
like an animal seeking a bed. 
Finally she settled on the floor 
under the window. The rain had 
stopped. Sunlight flamed her hair. 
The modest, untheatrical sound en- 
closed me: a simple tune, simple 
words, seeping into an unsuspected 
circulatory system within me . 

“I know where to count a million 
stars, 

I know where to take a ship for 
Mars, 

I know where they keep old rail- 
road cars. 

But I don't know where you live.

A castle fort or a little paper 
shack? 

Won’t you invite me back? . 

1 watched her mouth moving be- 
hind the gauze. She looked up and 
grinned, her eyes squinting in 
gaiety. 

“1 know where the mountains 
meet the sun, 

I know where to find a honey 
bun, 

I know where one and one is one; 

But 1 don’t know where you live.” 

"When I find out I’ll tell you,” 1 
said at last. 

“Who knows, maybe I’ll find out 
first,” she said cheerfully, starting 
to her feet. But the hospital gown 
caught on her knee, and the grace- 
ful gesture of rising collapsed into a 
clumsy clamor; and such delight 
did she take in everything that her 
departure was surrounded by a 
great shout of laughter. 

When she had gone I drifted into 
reverie, the dials presumably 
steady. I forgot to look. 

When she came again, I said, “I 
love you.” 

“Of course,” she said. 

“1 don’t know how.” 

“You’re only learning.” 

“1 am afraid. I don’t know what 
will happen. I don’t understand 
anything about myself.” 

She nodded. “That’s how it is.” 

“And you?” How brave I felt, 
asking. 

“I love,” she said. 



“Me?” 

“Oh. yes.” But her reply held her 
world of impersonal affection, no 
echo of the response for which 1 
longed. How could it be there? 

“And David?” 

"Oh, yes.” She was untouched in 
her person. 1 recognized, without 
experience, that whatever she did, 
her actions were rooted in inno- 
cence. And as I understood her 
matrix, 1 fancied that one who saw 
and treasured it might, someday, 
gently unlock her. 

Not I; 1 was too incomplete. 

I needed to know so much. 1 
summoned MEDIC to display 
books for me, books on bila-bidii — 
the popular no-effort African exer- 
cises; on yoga and isometrics, Coue 
and mental science. I began to 
move my wasted muscles carefully. 
From day to day I found that I 
could control some of the actions of 
my body. I felt myself growing 
strong — yet, as I touched the in- 
cipient flexions of my shoulders, I 
knew my “strength” was approxi- 
mately that of a caterpillar. I per- 
sisted. Blood pressure rose higher, 
and leveled off. The alarms re- 
ceded. Dr. Alfiere relaxed. 

She came now and then, and we 
talked. I taught her to play chess 
which, after winning two or three 
games, she said was too tight. She 
taught me to play, not with boards 
and complex rules, but games of 
laughter, even the children’s games 
I had missed. And she taught me to

value the present moment. 

1 loved her; but the fierce com- 
pulsion that 1 had expected, the 
physical hunger of which 1 had 
heard so much, had not come to 
me. We were companions, play- 
mates, pets. As I was incomplete, 
our intimacy would be incomplete, 
and I could see no answer . But 
1 was learning to wait, and learn. 

Then one day I managed to catch 
MEDIC at a moment when all its 
circuits were in use — a plane crash 
had sent the hospital into over- 
drive. A printout of my treatment 
sheet slipped past the censor nor- 
mally in place across requests from 
my room and certain things became 
clearer. I read chemistry texts. 

There w r ere continuous doses of 
tranquilizers in my air. in my food; 
prothrombin at the ready in case of 
need; antitestosterone, constantly; 
depression, to be treated with Ami- 
triptyline, joy with chlorpromazine. 
My emotions were regulated along 
with my metabolism. Stasis was 
medically advisable for me. 

What an immense amount of 
equipment, money and planning 
had been, was still, devoted to 
keeping me quiet. How could I fend 
off these poisons automatically 
thrust on me by my environment? I 
was tired of quarreling with Alfiere; 
he seemed compelled by some im- 
mutable and universal law to main- 
tain me in featurelessness. As it was 
in the beginning, is now and ever 
shall be. void without end . 

But 1 would end it. They had cul- 



tivated my mind; and 1 would out- 
wit them, using the single tool they 
had left me. There was a kernel of 
sense among the excesses of cultism 
of w hich I had been reading. 

1 practiced breathing. 1 tensed 
and relaxed the long flat muscles in 
my arms, feeling them grow tight 
and loose again. 1 learned to exer- 
cise without causing a single gauge 
to quiver, for without stress symp- 
toms there would be no drugs to 
correct them. There were a few bad 
days, but they came further and 
further apart. Alfiere was relieved. 

1 had adjusted, ceased to make 
w'aves. 

1 told Sue my secret; she brought 
me books that MEDIC could not or 
would not provide. 

And 1 wondered for what test 1 
was gathering resources. I would 
know in time . meanwhile, I was 
enjoying my self. 

I t was a long time before David 
came again. He looked less the 
healthy outdoorsman. The weather 
had grown cold. He greeted me 
gruffly and stood, legs wide apart, 
saying little. He had a job now at 
the Country Club, not enjoying it so 
much, sorry he hadn’t been in but 
very short of free time. 1 asked how 
Sue was. 

“She’s all right.” He stopped. 
"She — she’s not coming here any 
more.” 

“Oh, why not?” 

“1 don’t want her to." He looked 
wary. The expression was familiar

to me. There was something I was 
not to be told. 

“What do you mean?” 

“She’s spending too much time 
in this room, is all.” 

“If she doesn’t mind, what dif- 
ference does it make to you?” 

“Look, Phil, she's my girl. That’s 
the difference." 

“Do you own her?” 

“Of course not.” But he hesi- 
tated. 

“Can you say honestly that she 
doesn't want to?" 

"I don’t want her to," he said 
stubbornly. 

“So you do think you own her.” 

’’Don't push me too hard, 
rafiki.” 

"What, from here?” 

"I mean, like, she’s not coming 
again and that's all." 

I was again helpless. Could he 
prevent her by force if he chose? I 
couldn't imagine Sue allowing this 
clod to regulate her comings and 
goings. 

"It’s up to her. Whatever she 
says," 1 answered, with difficulty. 

“It's up to me, buddy, and don’t 
you forget it. Who the hell do you 
think you are, lying there like a log 
and pretending you are somebody?” 
He had wanted to say that to me for 
a long time. Now that he had, he 
was terrified. 

"Well, who do you think I am, 
then?" I said very softly. 

“Never mind that. Just don’t 
expect Sue again,” he said dog- 
gedly. 



“You don’t dare fight with me, 
do you?” 

"Fight? With you? You can talk 
rings around me, but fight? That’s 
a laugh.” 

“Well, well, here we are ready to 
battle over the female of the species. 
Locked horns and all that." 

“Just what do you mean by 
that?" he said, suffused. 

“You’ll tight on my terms, 
friend." 

He stood, fists clenched, face red 
and tight. “I can not tight with you 
at all." he said, squeezing the 
words out. “Just shut up, will 
you?” 

"Why not?” 

“I can’t explain.” 

"Of course not. If you fight with 
me you will have to acknowledge 
me. If you avoid it you can fool 
yourself into thinking I am a thing 
and not a man.” 

“You are a thing," he muttered. 

“Speak up, hero,” I said. 

Any minute he would break. He 
was trembling with suppressed rage 
and frustration. Whatever it was he 
wouldn’t ever say would finally be 
said if I kept pressing him. To my 
astonishment his words were not 
hurting me. I felt only that the con- 
frontation was important. Some- 
thing was becoming real. 

“You don’t know so much,” he 
said. "You are nothing. I could kill 
you without even touching you, 
without your ever knowing ... if 
you don’t shut up . 

“Sure you could. Just pull out

the plug over there. Nothing easier. 
Why don’t you, because 1 am not 
going to shut up.” 

“All I have to do is stop the 
checks.” 

“What?” 

“Nothing.” Too late, he backed 
off, groping for the door. 

“You'll have to explain that or 
there’s going to be hell to pay." 
“No.” 

1 pointed at the console. “I’ve 
been recording. MEDIC has it 
all . Explain, damn you!" 

“I said, all I have to do is stop 
signing checks.” His eyes shifted 
toward the console. He had never 
bothered to learn how MEDIC 
worked; he couldn’t tell if the re- 
corder was on. 

“What checks?” 

“The ones that pay for all this." 
“YOU pay?” 

“That’s right.” 

"Why? Why?" 

He fell disjointedly into the chair. 
It seemed far too small for all of 
him. Holding his head, staring 
dully at the floor, he said, “My 
father left money to take care of 
you. I have to sign for your bills 
every month." 

"I don’t understand. Why?” 

“He made a mistake. He thought 
it was his fault that you — that I — ” 
“Go on." 

"1 can’t." 

“Shall I call Altiere?” 

He rubbed at his mask. He gauze 
bellowed in and out with his rapid 
breathing. 



“You are my cousin. Did you 
know?” 

I shook my head. 

"Our fathers were friends. They 
married two sisters, our mothers. 
Godparents for each other and like 
that. We were born a few months 
apart ... I was very sick.” 

“You? What was the matter?” 
“I told you, I failed the premed 
course. I don’t understand it — it 
was something complicated, some- 
thing to do with antibodies. My 
father told me and told me but not 
much of it stuck. But I know I was 
sick all the time.” 

“What about me?” 

“You were all right.” 

"Then what happened?" 

“Did you ever hear of the beta- 
thymus?” 

"Something. What has that got 
to do . .” 

“My father discovered it.” 
"MEDIC?" This time I really 
did turn it on. “Betathymus.” 

— A small organ located within 
the thymus gland which operates in 
the differentiation of the two types 
of lymphocytes found in the mam- 
malian immunity system. Discov- 
ered 1979 by Dr. Luther Allgaier. — 
“More, MEDIC.” 

— No further information avail- 
able. — 

I switched it off. “So?” 

“Well, I was sick.. I kept catch- 
ing infections. My father tried all 
sorts of treatment, and nothing 
worked for long. He finally figured 
he’d better do something drastic .

He asked your parents if he could 
transplant some of your thymus to 
me. He said it was a simple opera- 
tion and couldn’t hurt you. All our 
blood groups and stuff were all 
right. Mother said it seemed like a 
gift.” 

1 fingered the small scar on my 
breast. "Well?” 

“He was wrong. They had to do 
it in a hurry, 1 was in trouble again. 
There wasn't anybody around to do 
it but my father, and he was ner- 
vous. Doctors aren’t supposed to 
treat their own families . but 
they had to hurry.” 

"And?” 

“He went ahead and did it." 

"What went wrong?” 

“I don’t know. But you began to 
catch things. You started to poison 
yourself. He tried transfusions, 
drugs, everything. Nothing worked. 
But he couldn’t undo it ... so he 
felt he owed it to you to take care of 
you." 

"Yes." 

"It took a long time for me to get 
well. They were kind of upset, it 
seemed like it was all for nothing. 
But 1 was all right after a while; so 
then Dad concentrated on you. 

"He gave up surgery in order to 
find out what he could do for you. 
When he found the beta he realized 
what had gone wrong — he had 
broken some connection in your 
system so that the cells which 
should have been learning to be 
antibodies got all screwed up . 
He talked about it a lot. 



“Then he died. He left you to me 
to look after. That’s why he wanted 
me to be a doctor. But I was no 
good at it. I just couldn't . .” 

"1 see." I said. “Get out.” 

He dragged himself out of the 
chair. 

“1 can't fight you, see? It wasn’t 
my fault. But I have to pay. He 
gave me what was yours.” 

“Get out." 

1 felt no anger, no pain, nothing. 

I was a thing after all, a man made 
thing. A pawn. David, strong and 
healthy, wore the body that should 
have been mine by birthright. 
Treachery — my parents who as- 
sumed the right to dispose of me; 
Luther, whose professional achieve- 
ment was torn from my future; my 
body, which had succumbed so 
easily. Luther had taken my morn- 
ings and my evenings, my com- 
panionships, friends, enemies and 
given them to his own son. I looked 
at my hands which had fashioned 
nothing, my white feet that had 
worn no shoes. 

David wore my shoes. David 
caught balls for me. David felt the 
skins of women against my skin . 
Sue. 

Oh, my disincarnate love, it is 
my flesh that acts with yours, while 
my heart and mind remain pickled 
here in storage. black squares 
and white alternates with uncom- 
promising edges. David's white, 
mine black, Luther the Player. 

He had cared for my housing, 
given me the books that opened my

mind, built my aquarium, talked 
with me. But we had never touched. 
Now 1 knew the desolation that had 
lain between us. Was this the way 
the world ended, by mistake? 

I can’t remember how long I en- 
dured that motionless despair. I 
felt that 1 was spread out on a pla- 
teau beneath a merciless and glar- 
ing sun, eyelids pinned open; the 
blinding light of truth beat upon 
my defenseless consciousness. 1 had 
never been given the power of 
choice. It was decreed; I was the 
device by which Luther was tested 
and found wanting, by which his 
sins were visited on David. Passive, 
inert, 1 was gratuitously cursed 
with sight. 1 need not have been 
granted consciousness to function 
thus; why did they have to wake me 
to show me my impotence? 

I dreamed of the Norns, who 
have one eye among them, one 
vision for the past, the present, the 
future . 

In this stasis I kept my heart 
steady. 1 went through the motions 
of my exercises. 1 propelled my 
protoplasm as a zombie propels its 
carcass, mechanically. WE came 
and went, oiling the mechanisms. 1 
chatted with MEDIC of German 
verbs. 1 watched the news. All the 
faces of David moving thievish 
through battle and babble. Had 
they all left their consciences in 
brine, stored out of sight? 

My uncle, who had never called 
me nephew. Duty compelled these 
people to pay money to keep me. 



out of their sight and hearts. With 
a lever long enough one can move 
the world ... a lever forged of 
links with other men . what was 
there for me to grasp? No thought, 
no act of which 1 was capable would 
move one atom of the world, one 
breath of anyone’s life. They had 
isolated me with lies. 

Something whispered, "eppur' si 
muove ... it moves, nevertheless." 
Once my window had been opened 
and I had survived. 

A woman pushed into my room. 
It was, oh anticipated misery, not 
Sue. A gray woman, correctly 
masked, expressionless black eyes, 
old. She trod heavily up to the 
tank, her step reluctant but reso- 
lute. She stared at me for a long 
time. 1 wondered if someone's mad 
visitor had got lost and wandered 
in. Stiffly she squatted in the chair, 
holding herself tightly upright in a 
corset of atmosphere. 

At last she broke the silence. 
“David has told you too much and 
not enough." 

Taken aback I did not reply. She 
heard my unvoiced asking. Still 
staring at me fixedly, she said in a 
harsh voice, “1 am your aunt.” 

“1 see.” 

“You see nothing. You have al- 
ways been protected." 

No one had ever taken such a 
tone with me. No patina of “poor 
Philip" lay upon that voice, impla- 
cable, bitter. 

“What is it you want to tell me?” 

“Why can’t you leave us alone?

killed his father. Let David’s little 
girl alone.” 

“What are you talking about?” 

“He was only a baby. He’s paid 
and paid for the mistake. He didn’t 
make it.” 

“I don’t understand.” 

She rose. I could see an irregular 
hem dangling under the white 
gown. She clung to the back of the 
chair as if her legs would not sup- 
port her weight. 

“David has told you only the be- 
ginning. He says you grumble 
about your life — you, who lie there 
in luxury, cultivating your clever- 
ness. all your wishes attended to, 
while David fills his time as best he 
can . ever since he can remem- 
ber you have been master of our 
lives. Only I can remember when 
you were not.” 

I pulled myself up slowly until 1 
was sitting. 

“I? 1 don’t even know you. I am 
master of nothing, as you see.” 

She laughed. “Don’t ask for my 
pity. It is all gone.” 

“But you accuse me. I have done 
nothing.” 

“You have taken everything from 
us, everything . Perhaps I am 
asking your pity, for David.” 

“David? Look at me. Look at 
him. He doesn’t need my pity.” 

"You still don’t see. 1 will tell you 
a story. 

“Your mother and 1 were born at 
the end of the war in Europe. There 
was much suffering. Families were 



separated, everyone was moving all 
the time. We lost our people; they 
were never found. We were two 
young girls alone in a defeated 
country. Our life was camps, trains, 
soldiers, more camps. We owned 
nothing. We belonged nowhere. All 
we knew was confusion and hope- 
lessness. 

“But we were lucky, we had each 
other. When there is only one per- 
son in your life that person is very 
important. Do you know that?” 

“How would I know? But I hear 
you.” 

She looked at me very sharply, 
light flashing on her glasses. 

“We came to America, went to 
nursing school. We met your father 
and Luther. Then there were four 
of us in the world, caring for each 
other . they were so good to us. 

“We had a home for the first 
time. We chose it all together. No 
one came and pushed us out to a 
train. It was ours, safe.” Her voice 
sank to a low chant. “There was 
love and hope, and you were born, 
fine baby, David was coming and 
there would be six of us. A real 
family. A real house. Ours . 

“Can you understand, it was a 
place for our feet?” 

Why was she asking me this? 

“David was born and everything 
went wrong. After Luther . 
afterward, there was nothing any 
more but you. He gave up his 
career, his dreams. David was sup- 
posed to carry on, make it up to 
you, and my sister. All he could 



102 



GALAXY 



think about was you. He never 
looked at David . and he forgot 
me. 

“David was only an ordinary 
boy. Luther drove him; David was 
never good enough for you, never 
tried hard enough. It broke the 
boy's heart . Luther was ob- 
sessed. He wouldn’t let David learn 
a trade, only medicine. And when 
David failed it killed Luther . 
eighteen years trying to correct his 
mistake, eighteen years, all the 
love, all the hope, gone as if it had 
never been. He couldn't do any 
more for you and he died.” 

“But this is your story. It has 
nothing to do with me.” 

“What is the matter with you? 
This is what your existence has 
meant for us. how can you say it 
has nothing to do with you?” 

“It wasn’t my doing, I didn't 
even know." 

She was very quiet for a moment. 
"Do we ever know what we have 
done?” She turned her back on me 
and looked out the window. 

“I remember Luther walking 
round and round this hospital, 
looking for the best view for you. 
He would go a few steps, stop and 
look in all directions, testing the 
scenery from all the angles . .” 
She turned to face me. “Your 
mother became pregnant again. 
We were afraid for her; your father 
was distracted and didn’t attend to 
his business. Elsa came here sud- 
denly. The baby was incompatible 
with her body. They died. Your 



father broke down then. He was ill 
for a long time. They let him drive 
too soon, or perhaps he had had 
enough. Who can tell? 

“Luther sold our house. We lived 
in an apartment then. There was no 
view . always, don’t tell Philip, 
don’t let Philip suspect, take care 
of Philip, protect Philip, always 
Philip . 

“Why didn't someone tell me 
after he died?" 

“For shame!” It burst from her 
in a long broken whisper. “I told 
him it wasn’t fair on us. If you were 
clever you ought to know, but 
Luther wouldn’t have it. It was for- 
bidden ... he made David visit 
you so you would have someone to 
play with.” 

“Why didn't you come?" 

Her eyes closed behind the rim- 
less glasses. “I was tired, boy. I re- 
sented every moment of your life. 
And I was afraid. 

“Such a small thing, such a little 
mistake, a tiny ignorance . and 
the waste, the waste. The people 
Luther could have saved; David's 
future; all because of you.” 

"But you cannot blame me.” 

“I cannot blame you. But I hate 
you." 

In the silence, black and white 
squares merged, combined in the 
gray of my aunt’s face. She stood 
quietly, emptied of her years of 
anger, weary. The day by day 
struggle to cope with her ordinary 
son and her extraordinary husband 
had worn her out. Her hatred was

not for me — how could it be? She 
did not know me — but for the 
hateful burden of my welfare. 

“1 am glad you have told me 
now," 1 said. 

"Now 1 am afraid,” she cried, 
shrinking against the chair, the 
armor of her bitterness all dissi- 
pated. “What have 1 done? But 
you, and David’s girl . you have 
cost him so much . Luther 
would be so angry with me . .” 
“He is dead. Aunt. I am alive, 
and 1 thank you.” 

“1 don’t know. 1 am so tired.” 
“Go home," I said gently. “Tell 
David to come and see me later. 1 
need a little time." 

She shook her head vaguely and 
shuffled out. 



N ot pawns, kings; the protective 
pieces moving blindly over a 
board gone indistinct. 

1 had forgotten to ask her name. 
1 pulled myself out of the fluid to 
my knees, slowly and without grace, 
resting frequently until my unprac- 
ticed muscles adjusted to each 
movement. MEDIC's tubes and re- 
ceptors, attached to me by rubber 
leeches, stretched through the 
liquid as I hauled my reluctant 
flesh to a standing position — cling- 
ing to the edges of the tank, trem- 
bling, but on my feet. Then 1 re- 
clined gradually back into the sup- 
porting fluid. The dials had swung 
to their upper limits. My blood 
pressure gauge lurched, rocked 



then, as 1 relaxed, sank back to its 
normal position. 

Connections ... 1 looked at the 
pseudopods of the machine, fitted 
with measuring and injecting de- 
vices. 1 had been so disconnected; 
and hidden in my isolation had 
been real and sentient fellow-crea- 
tures, masked. 

Outside the window in the fresh 
and poisonous air, patients were 
taking slow steps along the paths, 
breaking minor blood vessels as 
they healed, but healing faster than 
they ruptured . strangers bump- 
ed into each other, taking no notice 
of their white corpuscles' rush to 
shattered capillaries at the point of 
contact . friends gripped hands, 
bruising one another in affection . 
lovers embraced, sacrificing the in- 
tegrity of their bodies in passion . 

Outside, away from the womb, 
from prothrombin, antestosterone, 
MEDIC and masks there was pain, 
confusion, guilt . David, my 
aunt, who also knew what it was to 
be forgotten; and they were as real 
as golden Sue who found so much 
to love. 

I had outgrown sterility. I was in- 
toxicated with the real. The wall of 
lies had fallen, and 1 would be 
born. I would teach my ramshackle 
body all that it was capable of 
learning and begin. 

Even if 1 could only move one 
square, even if my first breath of 
nativity were to be all there was, I 
must reach for something to re- 
member. *

H obson looked up at the bright 
blue sky of Earth. In days gone 
by he had always managed to see in 



it a kind of hope. Seeing no hope in 
it now, he brought his mind back to 
business and tried for the third 



time that day to get his talent work- 
ing. The moment of mental relaxa- 
tion had helped. At last he was able 
to get started. The part of his mind 
that did such things reached ahead, 
while Hobson plodded on near the 
center of the column of irregular 
infantry. 

An area of land about two miles 
across, and lying a mile or so ahead 
of the column, stood out from its 
surroundings like an island. Luxu- 
riantly green with normal spring 
vegetation, the tract contrasted 
sharply with the background of 
irradiated and diseased countryside 
that had once been northern Illi- 
nois. There were many other such 
islands in the world. Hobson could 
see several to the right or left of 
where he marched. But the one 
ahead was unusually large and well 
preserved; also, it occupied a stra- 
tegic spot overlooking a highway 
junction and a river. So the place 
was now the target of Hobson’s 
probing mind and the objective of 
this two-hundred-man force of New 
American infantry. In command 
was “Colonel” — Hobson always re- 
membered to include the quotation 
marks in his thoughts — LaPorte. 

Hobson could tell that approxi- 
mately a hundred human souls oc- 
cupied the island ahead. He could 
not tell what they were seeing or 
saying or planning, but he knew 
they were there and what emotions 
they felt. Right now, obviously, 
they were unaware of the approach- 
ing attackers, for their emotional 



average was biased at a level of 
secure calm so high as to be almost 
unknown in Hobson’s world. 

Up near the point of the column, 
waiting for news from his pet psi- 
man, LaPorte turned his head to 
look back impatiently. Since the 
war everyone had begun to take for 
granted the existence of wild talents 
like those of Hobson. 1'heir owners 
generally lacked the intangibles 
needed for leadership, but they 
could be sure of a relatively safe 
and respected place in any organi- 
zation. 

His own skin was not much. Still, 
it was about all that counted with 
Hobson any more. To protect it, he 
stayed with New America. 

But — New America! Every time 
Hobson thought of the name, he 
wanted to spit. In his opinion a 
better name would be New Third 
Reich. And if he spoke that latter 
name aloud, no doubt LaPorte and 
the rest of the leaders would take it 
as a compliment. They were a gang 
of determined cutthroats w ho, dur- 
ing the past year, had begun to ex- 
tend their power across the sector 
that had once been called the 
Middle West — an area still under 
threat of attack from the remnants 
of the Asiatic forces scattered over 
the west coast and the Rocky 
Mountains. 

So w hen Hobson could not keep 
himself completely from thinking, 
what he did think was bitter. Some 
few men must always, at any cost, 
indulge their predilections for fight- 



106 



GALAXY 






uig mid hating — even now when so 
lew people are left anywhere. And 
; folks like me. talented or not. are 
drugged helplessly along, trying to 
survive . 



Aware of LaPorte's restless gaze, 
Hobson wiped his brain clean of 
distractions, willed it to fullest sen- 
sitivity. It registered that in the lush 
target area, the hundred inhabi- 
tants still seemed unaware that 
twice their number of armed 
desperadoes were trudging toward 
them along this once roaring super- 
highway where grass now grew 
through cracks in the slab. They 
were peaceful, up ahead. Opti- 
mistic. Hobson wondered briefly if 
a religious ceremony were in pro- 
gress: but he received no emana- 
tions of exaltation, no unison of 
feeling. It was just that the average 
levels of cheer and hope remained 
high. 

LaPorte looked around again. 
With a pang of nervous self-con- 
tempt, Hobson walked faster, to 
reach the head of the column. He 
passed between ragged tiles of men 
in whom he rarely could detect 
fears or hopes above the animal 
level. Men armed with weapons 
ranging from the carbines of the 
late lamented United States Army 
down to pitchforks and butcher 
knives. Men who wore as their uni- 
form a look of savagery. Men out 
for booty and women. Men who did 
not much like Hobson but wanted 
to have him around and fought to 
keep him alive — because of the in- 



surance he gave against dreaded 
ambush. Their heads turned with 
interest as he hurried forward past 
them to make his report. 

The colonel had left his self-de- 
signed insignia of rank well back 
within the already subjugated terri- 
tory: less danger, that way. of being 
assassinated by some countryside 
lout. He was a fairly large man, 
bigger than Hobson, with glasses 
and an habitually mild look. You 
might take him for a storekeeper or 
a clerk until you listened to him 
talk for a while. 

A hobson opened his mouth to 
report, he felt individual pat- 
terns of surprise and alarm coming 
from up ahead, as if the New 
American scouts had made contact 
with local look-outs. When LaPorte 
heard Hobson’s information, the 
colonel waved his column off the 
highway to a halt. Within a minute, 
the scouts’ arm-waves from ahead 
confirmed the contact. 

LaPorte thought over what Hob- 
son told him. "Only about a hun- 
dred of ’em, hey? All right, we pro- 
ceed as planned." 

Hobson hoped that the locals 
had a dozen machine-guns and 
would tight like fanatics. He could 
tell that many of them were women 
and children, and he knew what 
would happen if New r America 
carried the day. 

The sound of a shot rose from the 
island's near edge. “Missed," Hob- 
son muttered. He had felt the 



LIFE FORCE 



107 



nearly simultaneous start of three 
hundred people but no individual 
shock of pain or impact. 

LaPorte now signaled for a cau- 
tious advance. Moving forward at 
the colonel’s side, through the 
scanty cover of some roadside 
weed-mutation, Hobson walked 
erect. Lately he was not much 
afraid of bullets. But he was still 
afraid of New America. If he tried 
to betray them, or tried to run away 
and was caught . Hobson 
trembled, remembering past vic- 
tims of LaPorte’s vengeance. 

Perhaps more than he hated 
LaPorte, Hobson hated himself — 
abhorred himself for what he had 
become. This self-loathing was 
growing every day. Hobson feared 
that soon it might be strong enough 
to turn some awful balance inside 
him. 

The attacking formation crept 
toward the wooded island, moving 
along the stunted hedgerows and 
eroded gullies of this once fertile 
country. A belt of land around the 
island was normal enough for culti- 
vation. Hobson saw rows of corn 
sprouting there. A scout crawled 
back out of the quiet woods to find 
the colonel. “Looks like they’re 
pulling back. Chief. Wanta go 
straight on in?’’ 

LaPorte turned to Hobson. 
“What are they up to?” 

Hobson reached for the natives. 
He could not find the courage to try 
to save them with a lie; he hoped 
that somehow they might save 



themselves. “They’re withdrawing, 
all right . but 1 don’t think they 
mean to run very far. It’s funny, 
they don’t seem to expect any fight- 
ing, either. It’s as if they felt pro- 
tected in some way.” 

“They don’t mean to fight? 
Good. Push on, then,” the colonel 
ordered. "Maybe they're some re- 
ligius nuts." The colonel had once 
conquered a convent in Wisconsin. 

The people ahead did not feel 
more or less religious than average 
to Hobson. But he did not com- 
ment. For some reason this tiny re- 
bellion of withheld advice only 
made him hate himself all the 
more. 

If only his kind of “talent,” as it 
was popularly called, could be used 
to kill! He would get rid of LaPorte 
and anyone like him within striking 
distance. Hobson did believe that 
ultimately evolution might bring 
psi to effectiveness as a weapon, 
and maybe in the not too distant 
future. After all, mutation was sure 
to continue at a high rate. There 
was plenty of radiation about, left 
over from the cataclysmic wars. 
And the early rays in less than a 
generation had produced ten thou- 
sand persons with acute psi powers 
for each one such person known be- 
fore the wars. 

The so-called talent had been 
analyzed to a degree, though 
science and research were little 
practiced these days. Something 
about a sixth sense, something 
theorized to tuned in on other

GALAXY 



people's brain waves or other elec- 
tromagnetic emanations. Its ef- 
ficacy diminished sharply with dis- 
tance, of course. But it was pretty 
useful to pick up emotions, on the 
basis of which predictions of be- 
havior often could be made. Actual 
thoughts remained difficult to read 
except as they affected emotional 
states. A receptor rather than a 
projecting mechanism, it gave to 
some talented ones nevertheless the 
power to slightly move very small 
objects reposing a few feet away. 
That phenomenon fortified Hob- 
son’s belief that some day the psi 
talent might develop into a forceful 
means of defense or offense. So far, 
nothing of the sort had happened. 
Hobson felt helpless and hopeless . 

T he invaders had reached the 
island. They spread cautiously 
through its woods. There was no 
opposition, no sight or sound of the 
local population. Here and there 
stretched empty slit trenches and 
deserted strong points; with a few 
firearms these people could have 
put up a good fight. But Hobson 
sensed they had only moved off 
deeper among the trees. There they 
waited, and felt — almost safe. 

The village lay well within the is- 
land beside a small stream. The 
huts, mostly of concrete block and 
banked-up earth, had rifle slits for 
defense, but they were unmanned. 
Walks and vegetable gardens filled 
the spaces among the huts. The 
locals had built well and tended 



carefully — but had abandoned 

everything immediately to the in- 
vaders. 

A few of the buildings were 
roofed or doored with sheets of 
metal, some of which were oddly 
curved. Acting as a garden fence 
were enormous blades like those of 
the rotor of a troop-carrying heli- 
copter. 

"Hey, Colonel. Look here!” 

A man was pointing at a thin 
metal door. Peeling paint revealed 
part of a vast yellow star — the 
Asiatics' aircraft insignia. 

“The damn gooks!” Men looked 
about them with the alert anger of 
those who meet respected rivals in 
new territory. 

"It don’t figure. Colonel. Our 
'copter guys said the people they 
saw here were white and a few 
black." 

“Maybe the gooks keep’em as 
slaves." 

"Them Asiatics wouldn’t build a 
place like this!" 

That last argument, Hobson 
thought, was convincing. He had 
seen an Asiatic settlement or two, 
and they had looked like concentra- 
tion camps. The huts and gardens 
of this village showed too much in- 
dividuality to be under Asiatic 
authority. But why were they unde- 
fended? 

LaPorte, with a look of growing 
concern, was counting helicopter 
blades. There were enough of them 
to have carried in a considerable 
number of the Asiatics. LaPorte

looked closely at Hobson, who 
shrugged and shook his head. The 
people he could sense hiding confi- 
dently in the woods seemed not at 
all like yellow troops. 

The colonel set most of his men 
in a defensive perimeter around the 
village, then ordered a small crew 
into the huts to check for booby 
traps. 

The doors were standing open. 
Inside the huts there were some evi- 
dences of hasty departure but little 
of value had been left in sight. La- 
Portc temporarily forbade looting; 
it could be done in an organized 
way after the locals were definitely 
taken care of. 

"Hey, Colonel, we caught one of 
'em! Says he wants to talk to you.” 

Hobson focused on the thin little 
man being led into the village be- 
tween two New Americans. The 
captive’s fear was obvious even to 
normal senses. 

“Wants to talk, does he?” La- 
Porte looked the prisoner up and 
down. “Well, 1 won’t mind if he 
talks.’’ 

LaPorte led the way into a hut al- 
ready searched for booby traps. He 
relaxed in a chair, his boots among 
the dishes on a table. Hobson 
entered reluctantly and took a 
stand at one side of the single 
room, hoping desperately that this 
would be a short and mild interro- 
gation. The heavy window shutters 
were open, letting in spring air and 
sunshine. 

The prisoner pushed stumbling 



into the hut by the soldiers was 
about forty years old. not starved- 
looking but naturally scrawny. His 
clothes were not worth stealing. His 
gaze slid away from Hobson’s, fell 
to the floor before LaPorte’s. One 
big New American, a dedicated 
sadist, waited in the doorway be- 
hind the man. 

LaPorte pretended to yawn and 
stretch. “Where are your people?” 
“Off — off there in the woods. H- 
hiding. They’ll come back p-pretty 
soon. I — 1 have to talk to you first." 

The prisoner was all swamping 
waves of fear, which was natural 
enough — or was it? It did not feel 
to Hobson quite like fear of physi- 
cal pain. Hobson kept alert for any 
mass change in the emotional cli- 
mate outside the hut. 

LaPorte made the noise he used 
for a laugh. “You have to talk? Are 
you the leader, then?” 

“No, no.” The little man radi- 
ated positive disgust at the sugges- 
tion, a negation of ambition as 
strong as any Hobson had ever de- 
tected. “No, they just — sent me to 
talk. My name’s Joe Norwood.” 
“Well. I’m just delighted, Joe 
Norwood. Did they send you to talk 
to the Asiatics when they came 
here?" 

“Yes." 

“When you scared off those 
gooks, which way did they go?” 
And LaPorte guffawed. 

N orwood sneaked a look over 
his shoulder at the bulky, grin-

ning guard. “Please — look — let me 
tell what they said to tell, first. 
Then I’ll answer anything I can.” 

“ v vho’s they?” 

/ nod over a thin shoulder. 
“Some — some of the folks back 
there. They’re smarter about things 
than I am.” 

“All right. What’s this great 
message?” 

“I’m supposed to tell you 
about — life.” Norwood made the 
word important. 

LaPorte’s eyes flicked over to 
Hobson, who made the agreed- 
upon signal that everything was as 
it seemed, so far as he could tell. 
Hobson could nearly always detect 
the emotional traces of a lie, or the 
odd and unnamed things that ac- 
companied the use of a psi power. 

Norwood spoke quickly, trying to 
get out his message. “Life as a 
whole — it spreads out, you know. It 
tries to fill every bit of space every- 
where on Earth. Some — some guys 
think one reason men have brains is 
so they c?n spread life further some 
day, out to other planets and — and 
stars and places." 

The message had been memoriz- 
ed — in essence, not word for 
word — and delivery of it was a 
labor of love. Norwood stood taller 
as he spoke it. 

“Once — let me see — once in Eng- 
land a long time back there was a 
kind of beetle. Birds were its 
natural enemy, but it was just the 
same color as the bark of the trees 
it lived on. The birds had a hard 



time seeing it; they couldn’t kill off 
all the beetles, or even most of 
them." 

The colonel was receiving philos- 
ophy and beetles with mounting ir- 
ritation. But with a certain satisfac- 
tion, too. Probably he was now con- 
vinced that he faced a community 
of sweet talking religious nuts who 
had sent this fanatic to convert 
him. 

"But then the factories came,” 
said the fanatic. “And the smoke 
darkened the trees, and the birds 
could see the beetles and eat 
them.” 

LaPorte said: "So the beetles 
sent one fruity beetle to talk to the 
birds. Get to the point, hey?” The 
guard behind Norwood laughed 
obsequiously. 

Norwood was fearfully deter- 
mined. “No, no. Some of the 
beetles, maybe one in a thousand, 
had always been darker than the 
others. Now the dark ones matched 
the bark and the light ones didn’t 
and finally the — uh — the whole 
species of beetle was dark. Only 
one in a thousand was light. I’m 
not telling this right!” Norwood 
looked around as if for help, 
clenching his thin hands. “I’ve got 
to convince you. They said I might 
be able to!” 

LaPorte now looked like an actor 
in a comedy doing the slow-burn 
bit, sitting there with a pasted-on 
smile. But he was not acting and 
none of it was comedy to Hobson. 
He had the sickening thought that 



LIFE FORCE 



111 



this was going to be a bad inter- 
rogation. Hobson doubted that he 
could stand to watch it. Soon it 
would begin, the real questioning: 
How many men have you? How 
many guns? Gasoline? Ammuni- 
tion? Food? Where? And the beat- 
ing would start, to make sure the 
answers were right, and just on 
general principles. What can 1 do 
about it, Hobson moaned to him- 
self. Nothing, his rising anger 
answered; you have no guts to do 
anything, you miserable, crawl- 
ing ... 

"What happened to the Asiatics, 
you obscenity?” LaPorte was smil- 
ing. Hobson could smell the cess- 
pool boiling up behind that happy 
face. 

Norwood closed his eyes for a 
moment, radiating fear to Hobson, 
but also determination and a 
tremulous anger. "The yellow sol- 
diers came here and said we’d have 
to obey them. Right at the start 
they hurt some of us, for no reason 
at all ... Let me try to say it this 
way. Life defends itself, see? Every 
way it can. Every kind of animal 
has some defense against its natural 
enemies. A man has no natural 
enemy except other men, the brains 
of other men. But now some men 
are a danger to all of life!” 

Sudden suspicion Hared in the 
colonel's mind; his boots thumped 
to the floor. “Can you read emo- 
tions?” he barked. “Predict re- 
actions? Raise fires?" He ran 
quickly through the short list of 



known psi talents. “Can anybody 
here do these things?” 

“No, no.” Norwood shook his 
head. He glanced over at Hobson 
and seemed about to smile, as if 
finally guessing Hobson’s function. 

Now Hobson, in his increasing 
shame and self-disgust, would have 
dared to lie to LaPorte. But he 
could think of no lie that would 
help Norwood or his people. Hob- 
son signaled honestly that the pris- 
oner was telling the truth. 

LaPorte leaned forward in his 
chair. "Now this is your last chance 
to stay in one piece, mister. Talk 
straight and tell me where the 
gooks went. We know they were 
here." 

Tell him, tell him. pleaded Hob- 
son in his own mind. If this turns 
into a bad interrogation, I won’t be 
able to stand by. I'll go wild and get 
myself killed. 

N orwood, cringing but still de- 
termined. recited memorized 
words like a last desperate incanta- 
tion against evil. “You have to lis- 
ten! Life defends itself against the 
power of one human brain by using 
another human brain. Life doesn’t 
care about individuals — it feeds on 
itself all the time anyway. Uh — a 
feedback set-up — ” 

LaPorte’s anger passed critical 
mass. But as he opened his mouth 
to speak there came a cry from out- 
side the hut. The cry of a woman in 
pain or trouble: “Joe, Joe!” 

The dominant emotions out there

GALAXY 



were not those of an attacking 
force, which Hobson would have 
noticed sooner, but an intense 
interlocked web of fear and lust, 
hate and guilt, emanating from a 
handful of people. 

Norwood spun around to face the 
open doorway of the hut. The mas- 
sive guard blocked his way like a 
stone column, grinning, pushing a 
pistol barrel up under Norwood’s 
chin. But the little man, and Hob- 
son, could see past the guard to the 
outside. There a young woman 
struggled in the grip of two soldiers 
who were dragging her into the vil- 
lage. Again she cried out: “Joe!” 

"My wife," whispered Norwood. 
He broadcast despair, and rising 
fury. 

“Watch what comes next,” 
grunted LaPorte, his good cheer re- 
turning. 

Hobson knew suddenly, with a 
detached wonder at his own final 
courage, that he had had it, that he 
was casting his own small vote here 
and now against the New Third 
Reich. His fingers closed on his 
pistol. His gaze was on the middle 
button of Colonel LaPorte’s jacket. 

But from the corner of his eye, 
Hobson saw Norwood reaching up 
for the guard’s gun. Hobson hesi- 
tated, thinking: shoot the guard 
first, he has his gun drawn . 
then shoot LaPorte . then re- 
member to save one bullet. 

Norwood hardly looked capable 
of making a quick forceful grab 
and he was not attempting one, just 



reaching up his hand . 

. and time stood still for Hob- 
son as something new to him came 
in a great wave against his extra 
sense, something he could compare 
to the psi he knew only as the ocean 
tide might be compared to the wake 
of a motorboat. Hobson stood 
frozen, his gun half drawn, watch- 
ing the brawny guard topple stiffly 
backward, relaxing his grip on his 
weapon as Norwood's fingers closed 
on it. 

Hobson thought the fabric of the 
universe was tearing apart. He 
could only wait like an awed child, 
vaguely aware of Norwood ignoring 
him, ignoring LaPorte, Norwood 
fumbling inexpertly with the gun 
and stalked out of the hut, his 
small chin jutting in anger. Men’s 
voices began to yell outside the hut, 
first near, then far away. There 
were no shots, no sounds of fight- 
ing. 

The tide of — something — reced- 
ed slowly from Hobson’s percep- 
tion. The fabric of the universe was 
stable and familiar once more. The 
sun shone brightly through the 
open windows of the hut. A fly 
cruised in, then unconcernedly left 
through the doorway. 

Everything was quiet. Even La- 
Porte. Any awareness of the colonel 
had been blasted from Hobson’s 
consciousness by the awesome feat 
he had witnessed, but now he 
forced himself to turn. 

LaPorte lay back dead in his 
chair, apparently unwounded, eyes

wide, mouth slack, the pasted smile 
gone with everything that had been 
behind it. His right hand was 
clutching at his gun holster. 

The quiet was profound. Staring 
at the dead figure, Hobson tried to 
comprehend. His extra sense was 
still numbed by whatever had hap- 
pened, as his eyes might have been 
dazzled by glaring light. He could 
not tell what was going on outside. 

He found that, for the moment at 
least, he did not much care. He 
finally finished drawing his pistol, 
looked at it, then dropped it back 
into the holster. He walked out 
slowly into the sun, stepping over 
the motionless legs of the fallen 
guard. 

There were dead New Americans 
scattered everywhere, quite a num- 
ber of them. Joe Norwood stood a 
few yards from the hut, his arms 
around his wife, his face on her 
shoulder, the gun hanging in his 
hand as if forgotten. 

“Joe, it was my fault, not yours,” 
the woman was saying in low, com- 
forting tones. “1 wanted to stay 
near you. But 1 wasn’t careful 
enough, and they found me . it’s 
all right, Joe. It was their own 
fault.” She noticed Hobson as he 
walked slowly toward them. She fell 
silent a moment, then went on con- 
soling. "A lot of them ran away, 
Joe. And here’s one who didn’t 
mean you any harm. He can join us 
now.” 

Norwood looked around and 
Hobson saw tears in his eyes. Hob- 



son stood there waiting, not really 
expecting to go on living from one 
moment to the next. 

"1 wanted to explain things,” { 
said Norwood, staring fnto space. 

“1 just came right out and told the 
yellow soldiers, but they didn’t be- 
lieve me. This time 1 tried to go 
slow, give the whole picture, but it 
didn’t help. If only I could talk 
better. If only I could explain!” 

“Explain about — you?” Hobson 
asked. Suddenly it came to him 
that he was beginning to under- ' 
stand. He felt tired and shaky, now 
that it seemed he might be going on 
living. 

Norwood spoke in a dry whisper. 1 
“Anyone who decides to do some- ! 
thing that will hurt me, dies. Dies 
right there and then." He looked at 
Hobson. “When 1 was a boy, 1 saw 
another kid draw back his arm to 
throw an icy snowball.” He scream- 
ed at Hobson suddenly, “When I 
was five, my father tried to spank 
me!” 

“Hush, Joe. Hush. It’s all right 
now.” 

Norwood’s eyes wandered again. - 
"1 would have killed myself before 
now, 1 think. But the war came. A 
lot of people have died, trying to 
hurt me ... so now I think I do 
some good. 1 hope to God I do 
some good.” 

The woman stroked him. “You 
do, Joe. You keep us all safe.” 

Hobson looked up at the bright 
blue sky of Earth, and saw in it a 
kind of hope. *

JERRY POURNELLE, Ph.D. 



A STEP 

FARTHER 

OUT 

THIS GENERATION OF WONDER 



T he annual meetings of the 
American Association for the 
Advancement of Science are always 
exhausting affairs, but the 1974 
meeting in San Frhncisco was par- 
ticularly nerve racking. To begin 
with, the Triple- A. S. filled every 
meeting room in three large hotels. 
At every session, morning and 
afternoon for a week, 1 was faced 
with the problem of choosing just 
one from a menu of panels that 
included: the energy crisis; report 
by the Skylab scientist-astronauts, 
with Werner von Braun as an 
added attraction; Dr. Immanual 
Velikovsky presenting his theories 
for critical discussion by Big Science 
after 20 years of rejection; reports 
on the agricultural revolution; Carl 
Sagan, James Van Allan, and 
Bruce Murray on the new portraits 
of the planets; ecology and pollu- 
tion; exo-biology and the Viking 
Project; past and future efforts to 
detect signals from extra-terrestrial 
intelligences; fusion power; alter- 



natives to fusion power; Remo 
Ruffini, Robert Kraft, and Stirling 
Colgate on super-novae and col- 
lapsed objects; and on, and on, and 
on. 

To make the decisions harder, I 
was invited to press conferences 
where we could discuss the new 
findings with the panelists — but the 
press meetings went on at the same 
time as other presentations. How 
do you decide whether (1) to get 
involved in an argument between 
Rusty Schweikert and the Skylab 
astronauts on one side, and the de- 
votees of black box space explora- 
tion on the other, or (2) to attend 
Bruce Murray’s lecture on Venus 
seen from Mariner? 

During the week 1 stayed with 
Poul and Karen Anderson, which 
was probably a mistake. The mis- 
take wasn’t that they live on the 
other side of the Bay and so we had 
to get up at 6: 15 every morning lest 
we miss something important be- 
ginning at 8:00. No, the problem 



116 



was far worse — after hearing those 
panels, how could we get to bed at a 
decent hour? We had to sit up all 
night in discussion. 

After all, we saw most of what we 
thought we knew — and many of our 
hard-science stories — go crashing 
down in flames. It’s a brand new 
universe, one we’re only barely ac- 
quainted with. 



B efore someone gets the wrong 
idea, it wasn’t Velikovsky who 
brought down our comfortable uni- 
verse and solar system. The Veli- 
kovsky panels were strangely disap- 
pointing. To begin with they were 
more like debates than scientific 
discussions. Dr. Velikovsky even 
had a cheering section whose ap- 
plause probably embarrassed him. 

The majority of those attending 
the Velikovsky sessions seem to 
have come away with mixed feel- 
ings. Most scientists now believe 
Velikovsky is neither crank nor 
crackpot, but they still think he is 
most wrong. His views and their 
treatment by Carl Sagan and others 
is worth a column, but this isn’t it. 
For now, it’s enough to say he 
didn’t concede an inch, and he left 
with few converts. 

No, our understanding of the 
universe is changing more rapidly 
now than at any time in human his- 
tory because this is the first genera- 
tion to have the equipment to ob- 
tain the necessary information. 
Consider the planets as an example. 



As Carl Sagan put it during the 
meeting, “Not very long ago plan- 
etary astronomers were safe. We 
could make any speculation we 
liked and never be found out, and 
there were plenty of surprising 
speculations. I made some of 
them." (In his book with Shklov- 
skii. Intelligent Life in the Uni- 
verse. Dell, 1964, Dr. Sagan argued 
that the moons of Mars might be 
artificial satellites.) 

“Now the spacecraft hang like 
swords of Damocles over the heads 
of the astronomers, and you can see 
on their faces a strange amalgum of 
fear and hope as the probes ap- 
proach their destinations. In this 
decade the boundaries of realism 
have been pushed back. It is a de- 
cade of wonder.” 

He went on to prove it by demol- 
ishing our previous models of the 
planets. Science fiction readers are 
getting used to the “new Mars” and 
“new Venus”, but even those 
change with every analysis of the 
Mariner data. And Mars and Venus 
aren’t the only casualties of the 
spacecraft. It is now seriously 
thought that the Moon may have 
been formed inside the orbit of 
Mercury, although no theory has 
yet been advanced to explain how it 
got out here to be captured by 
Earth. 

T hen Poul Anderson and I 
watched Jupiter come crashing 
down with nearly every science fic- 
tion story about the giant planet as 



117 



James Van Allen told of the results 
of Pioneer 10’s encounter. To start 
with, it doesn’t seem we'll be using 
the Galillean moons as fueling 
bases for ships, or for colonies as 1 
suggested two columns ago. You 
can't get to them — at least not 
alive. 

Out to Callisto and beyond, the 
radiation belts around Jupiter are 
so intense that it will take many feet 
of shielding for man to survive. 
Unless someone invents a space- 
drive several orders of magnitude 
better than any we have on the 
drawing board the weight penalty 
of shielding makes it inconceivable 
that we can fly men anywhere near 
Jupiter. Dr. Van Allen estimated 
30 planetary radii as the closest safe 
distance. 

Goodbye to “Call me Joe," and 
"Meeting with Medusa”, and a 
host of other favorites old and new. 
And yet — the fusion scientists are 
very hopeful now. Perhaps a new 
kind of space drive is closer than we 
think, [See the August issue of 
Worlds of If for Dr. Robert Ens- 
man's science- fact article, “ Torch- 
ships — Now!" Ed .] 

There was more to the planetary 
sessions. On July 4, 1976, the first 
Viking probes will land on Mars. 
They contain an ingenious system 
for testing and detecting life on 
Mars, if there is any there. The 
sites chosen for the Vikings, by the 
way, correspond to the middle of 
the Atlantic Ocean, the Gulf of 
Tonkin, and the entrance to 



Yellowstone National Park — would 
Martian probes arriving at those 
points find life on Earth? 

But think about that date. About 
two years from the time this maga- 
zine is on the stands. Ten years ago 
the top planetary scientists could 
seriously wonder if Phobos and 
Diemos were artificial, and the 
Grand Canal more than a poetic 
image. Two years from now, we’ll 
have data about Martian life. Not 
guesses, hard data. 

As I write this, the Mariner 
probe has rounded Venus and is on 
its way to Mercury. As of now, we 
know almost nothing about Mer- 
cury. 1 have just finished a story 
about an expedition to Mercury 
and don’t dare send it to my agent 
because by the time this article is 
printed the probe will have arrived. 
In the short time between my writ- 
ing this and your reading it we will 
have learned more about Mercury 
than during the entire sweep of 
human history. 

Meanwhile, Pioneer 11 is on its 
way to Jupiter for our second look, 
arriving this December — and after 
it passes it will probably be headed 
for Saturn. By 1979 we'll have our 
first close look at the ringed planet 
and its giant moon Titan. A few 
years ago we knew nothing about 
the rings. Now we’ve bounced radar 
off them, to find that they’re not all 
dust at all, but have chunks several 
meters in diameter within them. In 
five more years we’ll have a close 
look. 



118 



GALAXY 



In 1987 we can have a close look 
at Uranus. The technology to send 
a probe there already exists. 

In other words, the information 
curve has never been steeper. In the 
past decade we may have learned as 
much about ourselves and our uni- 
verse as mankind learned in the 
previous three million years that 
we’ve been around. Even that time 
span changes like dreams — the first 
lecture we attended at the AAAS 
meeting was a presentation by 
Richard Leaky, Director of the 
Kenya National Museum. Leaky 
believes he has a skull, #1470, that 
dates genus homo to three million 
years ago. This published date has 
been disputed, but during his lec- 
ture Leaky announced a new find, 
1805. He stated that “If 1407 
bothers you, 1805 will horrify you.’’ 

Paleontology and space science, 
biology and physics, in every field 
we are learning faster than the pub- 
lishers can get their textbooks re- 
vised. 

Take earth sciences, for example. 
We’ve only begun to examine the 
Skylab data. There are thousands 
of photographs and instrument 
readings that no one has even 
looked at, much less analyzed. For 
the first time we have a real-time 
history of a solar flare, because the 
astronauts were able to point their 
cameras and instruments at it. As 
one astronomer pointed out, that 
one little splash-up, a minor thing 
and quite common on the Sun, pro- 
duced enough energy to run the US

The fusion scientists called their 
panel “Imitating the Sun.” 



F our years ago I wrote an 
article on the coming energy 
crisis in the United States. As part 
of the research I visited the best 
known fusion research laboratories 
and asked what they would do with 
more money. They really had no 
good answers. 

No longer. Now they can do three 
times as much profitable research, 
because now they know at least 
twice as much about fusion as they 
did four years ago. 

What else should we look at? 
Returning to Skylab, it wasn’t only 
the solar scientists who were ex- 
cited. Earth resources and earth 
sciences took a quantum jump 
from Skylab, and may take another 
when the unexamined data brought 
back is analysed. The materials-re- 
search people were ready to do 
handsprings over the crystal 
growths obtained in the space en- 
vironment. Ultra-pure materials, 
thin film development, biologically 
produced substances — there were 
surprises in every experiment, and 
all were exciting. 1 asked Dr. Harry 
Gatos, the MIT metallurgist in 
charge of materials research con- 
ducted by Skylab, if among the as 
yet unanalysed data there might 
lurk something as significant for 
everyday society as was the dis- 



covery of the transistor. 

“I can’t rule that out,” he said. 
He was trying to be cautious, but it 
wasn’t possible. “I’m certain that 
space materials-research can be as 
fundamentally important as any 
discovery in history.” 

Is it any wonder that the Ander- 
sons and I were unable to knock off 
for sleep at night? Every one of 
these developments deserves an 
article as long as this one. I apol- 
ogize to the readers for this grass- 
hopper presentation, and I only 
hope I can convey a small part of 
the excitement going on in scien- 
tific circles. 

It’s not only the discoveries we’ve 
just made. Nearly everywhere was 
the feeling that the best is yet to 
come — and we’ll live to see it. 

Consider collapsed objects in 
space, and particularly the black 
hole. Black holes are theoretically 
possible in Newtonian physics; but 
they were first described as a theo- 
retical anomoly lurking in Ein- 
stein’s General Relativity. No one 
paid much attention to them. 

However, back in the thirties 
Fritz Zwicky of Cal Tech’s Mount 
Wilson organized a search for 
supernovae, and argued for their 
importance in understanding the 
universe. In the forties J. Robert 
Oppenheimer did some basic theo- 
retical work on black holes and 
neutron stars, and there began to 
be a feeling that such things might 
exist. 

Unfortunately, there wasn’t any 



120 



GALAXY 



way to locate them, or to study 
them if someone told you where 
they might be. Radio astronomy 
didn’t exist. X-ray astronomy, 
which requires instruments in space 
above the earth’s atmosphere, was 
not even possible. 

Then, in 1968, British radio- 
astronomers discovered something 
entirely unsuspected, something 
absolutely new; the pulsars. These 
incredible objects emit a brief but 
very intense burst of radio energy at 
precise intervals on the order of a 
second. No one knew what they 
were and as late as 1971 Robert C. 
Haynes’s, in his excellent survey of 
the space sciences, found no con- 
census among astronomers. They 
might, he said, be any of a half 
dozen things — or even something 
unknown. 

In San Francisco last week there 
wasn’t anyone who wasn’t sure that 
pulsars are neutron stars. There 
was even agreement on how they 
are born. This too is worth a com- 
plete article. The point is that the 
conference was organized by Fritz 
Zwicky, and although he died two 
weeks before the meeting, he had 
lived to see the whole story from 
supernova to black hole known and 
understood. 



O nce again, it is not because 
this generation is more intelli- 
gent than past ones. We only have 
better tools to work with. We have 



computers to analyze incredible 
quantities of data. We have instru- 
ments which will detect the almost 
infinitesimal slowing down of the 
pulsars, one of the crucial facts 
indicating that they are very prob- 
ably neutron stars. 

There was more, however. Ten 
years ago, black holes were a theo- 
retical construct attracting atten- 
tion but not taken very seriously. 
Now most astronomers are agreed 
that we are actually observing one. 

Well, by definition you can’t ob- 
serve a black hole, because the 
escape velocity from the hole is 
greater than the speed of light. No 
signal or information can come out 
of the hole. But we can observe the 
hole’s effects on a companion, and 
that’s what is happening right now. 
Many astronomers are convinced 
that Cygnus X-l is a binary with a 
black hole component. 

Ten years ago the holes were 
pure theory. Now, Remo Ruffini of 
Princeton can seriously announce 
that he believes there are hundreds 
of millions of them in our own 
galaxy alone. Moreover, we may be 
detecting energy from the amount 
of collapse. We may be witnessing 
the deaths of stars. 

Many of our key observations are 
accidental. When Congress ratified 
the Treaty of Moscow, which bans 
nuclear tests in the atmosphere and 
in space, a condition was attached. 
The United States must unilaterally 
be able to detect any space weapons 
test. This brought about the practi- 



A STEP FARTHER OUT 



121 



cal birth of x-ray astronomy, and 
even now the data comes in like 
quotations on the stock market 
ticker. 

To detect weapons tests we 
launched the Vela satellites. These 
search for x-ray events in space, 
and record the time and source of 
x-ray bursts lasting longer than a 
second or so. They hadn’t been up 
long when they began to chatter. 
Something out there was putting 
out bursts of x-ray energy, and a lot 
of it. 

It didn’t take long to decide they 
couldn’t possibly be nuclear tests. 
From Vela’s inception we have ob- 
served about half a dozen signifi- 
cant x-ray events each year. They 
are scattered throughout the sky, so 
that it is certain they are compara- 
tively close — tens to hundreds of 
lightyears, no more. Were they 
farther away, thousands of parsecs, 
they would cluster around the 
ecliptic, and they don’t. 

That many events in such a com- 
paratively small volume of space 
means that in the galaxy as a whole 
there are an incredible number. 
The bursts are short, and they 
come on and go off abruptly. 
Ruffini believes they may be the 
result of the very moment of 
collapse, the instant at which a 
white dwarf falls inward to become 
a neutron star or black hole. 

Meanwhile, both here and in 
Europe, incredibly sensitive gravity 
wave detectors are under construc- 
tion. It will not be long before .we 



can compare the timing of the x-ray 
events with the arrival of gravity 
waves. Once again we are about to 
learn at least as much as we know; 
another doubling of knowledge. 

A generation of wonder. It is a 
unique generation, as many of 
the panelists pointed out. Fifty 
years ago — even ten years ago — we 
couldn’t study the basic structure 
of the universe because we hadn’t 
the tools. We could not answer even 
the simplest questions about the 
solar system; we couldn’t get out 
there. 

Fifty years from now we won’t be 
able to study the basics because 
they will already be known. Our 
grandchildren will learn in grade 
school what it will be our privilege 
to discover. The information curve 
may never be steeper than it is now. 

Next year the AAAS meeting will 
be in New York. It promises to be 
as exciting as this year’s, with an 
added bonus. One of my frantic 
meetings in San Francisco was with 
AAAS officials. The topic was sf- 
writer participation in the New 
York meeting. [Jerry is this year's 
President of Science Fiction Writers 
of America. Ed.\ The information 
flow to science has become so great 
that no one understands what it all 
means — not just what it means for 
science, but what it means for all of 
us. Perhaps science fiction writers 
can help.

H er husband Howard and wife 
Karen were snoring softly on 
the couch when she came in. They 
had been watching a hologram 
when they fell asleep. Dianne smiled 
when she saw them and quietly 
crossed the cabin to switch off the 
set. The cassette had played itself 
through, and now the set offered 
only a strange view through a 
ragged-edged hole into a darkness 
against which stars spun and swirl- 
ed lazily. Dianne frowned abruptly 
at odd stabs of agony in her abdo- 
men, and then, as the pain worsen- 
ed. she clutched the holograph con- 
sole and sagged against it for sup- 
port. And closed her eyes. 

She woke up very slowly, a little 
at a time, and found herself looking 
up through a large and jagged hole 
in the ceiling of the airlock. 
Through the hole, she could see 
utter blackness shot with pinpoints 
of utter brightness. The universe 
seemed to pass in review as she 
spun with the ruptured hulk of 
Compartment F. She felt again the 
horror gnawing at what was left of 
her guts. She opened her mouth to 
scream but it hurt her too much. A 
roaring noise filled her ears. Blood 
engorged her eyes, making the pin- 
points of utter brightness glow a 
sickly red as they moved past the 
hole. Within the shell of her life- 
rig, she felt minute stings as hypo- 
dermic needles automatically slid 
into her flesh. 

Dianne Drake forced herself to 
subside and listened to the harsh 



sound of her own ragged breathing 
while waiting for the drugs to take 
effect, to make the pain and fear go 
away. She had not been dreaming 
about the hole and the stars. She 
was not with her wife and husband. 
She was not aboard the Wheel now. 
There was no Wheel anymore. 
Something had happened to it — 
she didn't know what and doubted 
that she would ever know. 

She had not been dreaming 
about the pain, either, because 
something had happened to her, 
too. She and the heavy-maintenance 
robot had just re-entered the Com- 
partment F airlock when the deck 
suddenly buckled underfoot, fling- 
ing her against a bulkhead. The 
massive robot had grazed her across 
the abdomen, caving in but not 
puncturing her shell, as it was 
heaved past her and flipped out 
through the open airlock hatch. 

She had been hurt, hurt badly, 
she knew that, and she was dying 
here in the dead hulk of Compart- 
ment F, wreckage within wreckage, 
she knew that too. Oh God please 
don't let me die here don't let me 
die alone — 

No. Not alone. 

A-26 moved into her field of 
vision and lowered itself to its knees 
beside her, like a giant, quicksil- 
ver-colored mantis descending upon 
its prey. Dianne had always felt 
uneasy in the presence of cyborgs, 
but she nonetheless gave A-26 a 
faint smile and gestured beckon- 
ingly.

The cyborg moved its good hand 
over her lightly, almost tenderly, 
testing the thin straps that bound 
her to the deck. A-26’s other hand 
dangled forlornly at the end of a 
tangle of thin cables and hair-fine 
wiring. The plastic forearm, shat- 
tered during the Wheel’s break-up, 
looked like an exploded timepiece, 
all disarrayed springs and wires. 

“1 thought you had expired, Ms. 
Drake,” said A-26's inflectionless 
voice in her helmetphones. “You’ve 
been unconscious for several 
hours.” 

"Just . resting my eyes.” She 
tried to laugh. The effort was too 
great. The pain under her ribs 
stabbed too deeply. She bit into her 
lip, forcing herself to be still and, 
when the pain had receded some- 
what, she said very softly, “Are 
there . did you find others?” 

“No, Ms. Drake. Most of Com- 
partment F seems to have twisted 
away with Compartment E. It’s un- 
likely that anyone in this section 
had time to get into a life-rig. I did 
not find the remains of an unidenti- 
fiable human being in the EVA 
monitoring room — " 

Poor George. Dianne thought, 
closing her eyes, shutting out the 
soft, maddening swirl of lights be- 
yond the hole, poor George. 

“ — and," the cyborg went on. 
"the wreckage of A-20 in the 
life-rig maintenance room. Every- 
one and everything else is gone. 
Compartment G broke away clean- 
ly. so it’s quite possible that it man- 



aged to seal itself in time.” 

Possible, Dianne reflected dully, 
but not too probable. It was also 
possible that G had ruptured, that 
Howard and Karen were dead, 
blown up in their sleep. If only the 
maintenance robot had not taken 
so long to set the plates for her, if 
only she could have finished her 
EVA work on schedule, if only she 
could have gotten back inside when 
she should have, she would not be 
here. She and Howard and Karen 
would have all gone on sleep-shift 
together, she would not be here, 
she would be with her husband and 
wife, not here, not alone, God God 
oh God it hurt it hurt — 

She pounded on the deck with 
her fists, strained against the 
straps, causing herself worse agony. 
She screamed until the pain in her 
emptied lungs was greater than the 
pain in her bruised abdomen, and 
then, as the needles again began to 
slide into her, she almost expired 
from a coughing fit as she tried to 
suck air back down into her chest. 

“I’m sorry that there’s nothing I 
can do," A-26 said tonelessiy, just 
before Dianne blacked out again. 

K aren’s hands, surgeon’s 
hands, sure, steady hands, 
cupped Dianne’s face tenderly. 
They kissed each other passion- 
ately. and then Karen suddenly 
jerked away in the darkness with a 
yelp of surprise. Howard had bitten 
her on the thigh. A pillow fight en- 
sued between Karen and Howard. 



ACT OF MERCY 



125 



Dianne, caught in the middle of the 
bed, lay convulsed with laughter 
between the combatants. 

Finally, when the last pillow had 
been sent flying across the cabin, 
Howard and Karen stretched out 
on either side of their new wife. 

“Welcome to the marriage,” 
Howard said, kissing Dianne on the 
cheek. “Now that you’re in our 
power, we shall have our way with 
you. my dear.” 

"Just as long as you don’t bite me 
on the leg," Dianne said, hugging 
his neck. Karen snorted. And then 
legs and arms became entwined, 
and hands touched things in the 
darkness, and then the cabin be- 
came suffused with the light of 
thousands of stars. 

"Two-Six?" Dianne called, re- 
signedly letting dull pain pull her 
out of sleep, out of the dream. 

“Ms. Drake, how do you feel?” 

"Like . pulped meat. 1 am 
pulped meat." 

"You mustn’t despair. Help will 
come soon. Some sections of the 
Wheel were surely able to seal 
themselves. A help-call was un- 
doubtedly transmitted within min- 
utes of the break-up." 

Dianne opened her eyes and, 
pointedly avoiding the slow swirl of 
lights beyond the hole, looked at 
A-2b. The cyborg had strapped 
itself to a stanchion and seemed to 
be sorting through the tangle of 
wires and cables sprouting from the 
plastic upper arm. She tried to 
speak again but produced only a 



dry hiss in the back of her throat. 
She moved her head weakly, grop- 
ing with her mouth for the water 
nipple in her helmet^ When she 
finally found it, she sucked grate- 
fully, noisily, for several seconds. 

“How long,” she managed to 
gasp, “since the accident?” 

"Approximately thirteen hours, 
Ms. Drake.” 

"Any sign of . rescue? Any- 
thing?” 

"Not yet." 

Dianne turned her head slightly 
and saw the two plastic halves of a 
replacement forearm pinned to the 
deck by the cyborg’s foot. "Is there 
any . point in repairing yourself, 
Two-Six?” 

"I am programed for self-main- 
tenance.” 

"Robots are . programed, 
Two-Six.” 

"I have directives, Ms. Drake." 

“Aren’t you at all . afraid 
of . dying again?” 

“The question has no meaning 
for me. Please rest now. Conserve 
your strength.” 

"Do you . what was it like the 
first time . you died?” 

“1 don't remember. Please rest.” 

“Two-Six, I’m afraid to d--" 
Dianne broke off in terror. She 
knew that she was dying, that the 
careening heavy- maintenance ro- 
bot’s almost casual blow' had mush- 
ed her insides to jelly, but she could 
not bring herself to speak of her 
own death. She tried to imagine ob- 
livion. She tried to imagine Howard 



126 



GALAXY 



and Karen living on without her. 
She could not envision death as 
being much different from space, 
only without all of the stars, with- 
out any stars at all, just blackness 
and vastness and tumbling forever 
into that infinite and unrelieved 
darkness, and the pain was rising 
in her again, and she wondered if, 
in dying, in becoming dead, she 
would carry the memory of so much 
agony with her as she started to 
tumble and God God God! 

If only it did not hurt so much. 

If only Karen and Howard were 
with her. 

If only the heavy-maintenance 
robot had struck her squarely, 
caved her in completely, killed her 
instantly. 

If only she had gone on sleep- 
shift with her wife and husband. 

If only dying did not take so 
long. 

If only she were not cut off from 
her loved ones. 

If only it did not hurt so much. 

“Two-Six." 

"Yes, Ms. Drake?" 

Dianne hesitated, gathering her 
courage, and sought the water 
nipple. She got a small mouthful of 
water before her supply gave out 
with a soft, sucking noise. She held 
the cool water in her mouth for a 
long time before swallowing. 

“I want you to help me,” she 
finally said, fumbling at her belt for 
her spot-welding pistol. She did not 
have the strength to detach it once 
she had located it. "Two-Six, take 



the gun . adjust beam for maxi- 
mum intensity . point-blank at 
my helmet . death should be in- 
stantaneous . and painless.” 

"Ms. Drake, I cannot do yhat 
you ask." 

“Oh, oh God, please!” 

“My programing forbids the tak- 
ing of human life, whether through 
action or inaction.” 

“You were human once!” Dianne 
cried out, feebly vehement. “Don’t 
quote manuals at me . please, 
please understand . I’m dying. 
I’m already dead ... I'm in pain, 
damn you!" 

“Help will come," A-26 flatly in- 
sisted. "You must have hope.” 

Hope? She was too weak to hurl 
the word back at the cyborg. Hope 
of what? Hope of what? 

Hope of rescue. But the Wheel 
had broken up. Compartment F 
was tumbling through space, an 
inert shell, with one chance in a 
million of being sighted and investi- 
gated by any rescue ship — presum- 
ing, of course, that there even was a 
rescue ship. 

Hope of reunion. But Howard 
and Karen might already be dead, 
and even if they still lived, even if 
Dianne were found, even then, 
could a three-way marriage func- 
tion as such with an incapacitated 
member? 

Hope of living. But she was 
dying. 

Hope of dying. But she was dying 
in agony. 

Hope of sleep. She slept.

T hey looked at her messed-up 
body and shook their heads 
sadly and began to shave her head. 
Dianne knew what was happening 
and tried to push them away, but 
there were straps binding her to the 
table, holding her still. She screech- 
ed with horror as they began to 
remove the top of her cranium, and 
then she stopped screeching, be- 
cause they had severed her from her 
body, they were carefully lifting out 
the essence of Dianne Drake, draw- 
ing the brain and spinal column out 
of the useless body. They did things 
to the essence of Dianne Drake. 
They built a mantis-like body of 
metal and plastic in which to house 
the altered essence of Dianne 
Drake. They activated the mantis- 
like body, and all that remained of 
Dianne Drake, the special knowl- 
edge, special skills, special useful- 
ness, was as one with the self-wind- 
ing, self-propelled body. 

They gave the body an identity 
number and put it aboard a Wheel, 
where it worked in Hydroponics 
under the supervision of a human 
being named Howard Drake. 
Where it worked in Surgery under 
the supervision of a human being 
named Karen Drake. Where it did 
not know and was not known. 

Where it was worse than 
dead . 

Where it was alive and cut off 
from the living. 

Dianne’s throat was on fire when 
she woke up, but there was no more 
water. There was no hole in the 



ceiling, and no swirl of stars. There 
was no pain. 

There was light. There were 
muted voices all around her. 

“Two . Six?” she hissed, 
barely audible. The light hurt her 
eyes, and she could not understand 
what the soft voices were saying. 
“Two-Six . where am I? Two . .” j 

She blinked frantically, trying to 
focus her eyes and, suddenly, the 
light was gone, the voices were 
gone, the jagged hole was above her 
once more, but so, too, were people 
in life-rigs. She was in pain now, ( 
writhing on the deck, unrestrained | 
by straps, and there was a noise in 
her helmetphones, everything all 
right everything is all right every- j 
thing is going to be all right, and 
then she was alone again, bound to 
the deck of the airlock in Compart- 
ment F,'and then she was not 
alone, she was with Howard and 
Karen, the three of them huddled 
together in their Compartment G 
cabin, pleasantly tired after work- 
shift and very much in love with one 
another, and then, and then . 

Dianne let go of the images, 
blinked them away, and saw that it 
was very bright in the operating J 
room. For just an instant, she 
imagined that the source of illumi- 
nation was a very large and jagged 
hole in the ceiling through which 
the stars poured their light. The 
notion tied immediately, but she 
nevertheless frowned with thought, 
groggily aware of a wrongness 
about the presence of such a hole in 



128 



GALAXY 



an operating room. She shoved the 
whole matter from her mind when 
she saw Karen standing beside her. 

“Oh God,” Dianne croaked, cry- 
ing. "Oh God. Oh God.” 

Karen leaned over to embrace 
her gently. "It’s okay now,” she 
murmured soothingly. “It’s okay. 
Everything is going to be okay.” 

“1 . so afraid, so afraid . 
Howard?” 

L “He’s safe, we're all together 
again, honey, everything is — ” 

- "Where is . he?" 

“Soon." Karen kissed Dianne on 
the mouth and drew away. “He’ll 
be here soon. Sleep now.” 

“Karen . .1 don’t want it to be 
a dream.” 

"It’s real. Everything is going to 
be all right. Sleep. Sleep.” 

She slept or awoke — she could 
not be certain, because Karen and 
the bright operating room went 
away, and the pain returned, and 
the stars spun past the hole above 
her. and A-26 tinkered with its 
shattered arm, and they were shav- 
ing her head again, cutting off the 
top of her skull again . 

No!" 

"Easy,” murmured Howard. 
"Easy." 

"I’m afraid, Howard,” Dianne 
whispered. “If I open my eyes, 
you’ll go away.” 

"I’m here," he said. She could 
feel his breath on her cheek. 

“Where am I?” 

"You’re aboard the Wheel, 
what's left of it anyway, and I’m

here. Karen’s here, and we’re going 
to take : . good care of you.” 
“You’re crying, Howard.” She 
slitted her eyelids, mindful of the 
light, and regarded him sadly. His 
eyes were wet and red. “I don’t 
want to die. I don’t want to leave 
you and Karen.” 

“We don’t want you to leave.” 
“I’m scared, Howard. Don’t let 
them — ” 

He silenced her with a kiss. 
“Everything is going to be okay.” 
“Everything,” affirmed Karen as 
she loomed over Dianne. Karen 
was wearing her surgeon’s gown 
and cap now. “You’d better leave 
now, Howard.” 

“I’ll stay,” Howard said. “She’s 
my wife, too, Karen.” 

Karen nodded slowly and looked 
down at Dianne, who lay upon the 
table between her spouses, groping 
for the memory of another time 
when she had lain thus. Karen 
touched Dianne’s face with one of 
her sure, steady hands and said, “I 
love you,” and Dianne felt her 
surgeon-wife’s fingers trembling 
against her skin. 

“1 love you both,” she murmured 
softly, good-bye. / love you. and 
then Howard and Karen were gone, 
their faces replaced by those of 
strangers. Dianne blinked, startled 
by the change, and the hole was 
above her once more, the stars were 
sweeping past as Compartment F 
tumbled through space. She was 
alone with A-26 again, in pain 
again. 



Strangers? 

She bore her agony in silence as 
she tried to separate products of 
imagination from realities. She 
conjured up images of Howard and 
Karen, of a scalpel trembling in 
Karen’s hand, and she took heart. 
There were no strangers. Howard 
and Karen lived. They were her 
hope of salvation, they knew what 
she would want, they would not let 
her down . 

She lay waiting for an act of 
mercy, for a final gesture of love, 
and she kept telling herself, Every- 
thing is going to be all right, every- 
thing is going to be all right, even 
as she slid into other dreams, other 
times. Awake or dreaming, every- 
thing is going to be all right. 

She lay waiting. 

She lay dreaming. 

T AWOKE. 

It found itself on a table in a 
brightly illuminated room. It felt 
confusion for a moment as she 
clutched at memories of dreams, 
and it sensed within herself a ter- 
rible, bitter loneliness, a vague 
awareness of having been somehow 
betrayed. It could not account for 
her feelings, and it was further sur- 
prised to feel grateful when, finally, 
she let it sit up. Promising itself a 
psych-check at the first available 
opportunity, it stepped down from 
the table rather like a mantis 
moving from leaf to leaf. 

No dreams, it dutifully reminded 
itself, are good dreams. 4

WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

In the 24th Century mankind has 
developed interstellar travel and is 
tackling the huge task of siphoning 
off Earth's excess population. Un- 
fortunately, only one other habit- 
able planet. Terranova, has been 
discovered, and an economic brake 
has been placed on the flow of 
settlers to it by making the journey 
highly expensive. This policy was 
introduced and en forced by the vast 
Starflight Corporation which con- 
trols all manufacture and operation 
of spacecraft. Most of the Starflight 
fleet is engaged in the transporta- 
tion of settlers, but it has a separate 
Stellar Exploration Arm which con- 
tinues with the search for habitable 
new worlds. The President of Star- 
flight Corp. is ELIZABETH LIND- 
STROM, the richest and most 
powerful human ever. She has been 
debased and corrupted by her 
power to the extent where — like 
sultans of old — she has been known 



to kill employes for minor trans- 
gressions. 

VANCE GARAMOND, captain 
of the exploration ship Bissendorf, 
was about to leave Earth on a year 
long mission and was summoned to 
Elizabeth's headquarters for a pre- 
flight audience. While waiting im- 
patiently for his interview he was 
entrusted with the job of looking 
after Elizabeth s small son. Harald . 
Garamond. who was becoming dis- 
enchanted with the fruitless search 
for other planets, was too busy with 
his own thoughts to notice Harald 
climbing up a tall statue. Before 
Garamond could prevent the acci- 
dent. the boy fell and was killed. 
Garamond knew at once that not 
only was he doomed, but that the 
President's psychosis would prompt 
her to wreak vengeance on his wife. 
A1LEEN, and his own son. CHRIS- 
TOPHER. 

He discovered, however, that the 
bov's death fall had not been ob- 
served. so he hid the body and 



133 



slipped away from Starflight House. 
Concealing his panic, he collected 
his wife and son from their apart- 
ment and took them to the space- 
port. At gunpoint he forced a 
shuttle pilot to fly them up to the 
Bissendorf which was waiting in 
orbit. Knowing that the dead child 
would he found at any moment. 
Garamond got through on the 
radio to his second-in-command 
and close friend. CLIFF NAPIER, 
and ordered him to blank out all 
communications between the Bis- 
sendorf and Earth. The precaution 
was taken just in time — back at 
Star/light HQ Harold's body had 
been discovered. Elizabeth had al- 
ready slain the luckless servant who 
made the Ibid, and had sent out an 
order that Garamond was to be 
brought back to her. 

Aboard his ship Garamond 
ordered it to leave the Solar System 
at maximum speed and was lucky 
in that the spatial “tide" was favor- 
able to him. The ships employed by 
Earth could operate more efficiently 
in regions where the density of 
space was high, and in this case the 
local conditions enabled Garamond 
to escape his pursuers. The trouble 
was that he had nowhere to go — 
there was no point in fleeing to 
Terra nova because Elizabeth s 
ships would be there wailing for 
him. 

The Bissendorf was provisioned 
fora year, so Garamond decided to 
use that time to follow up a private 
dream. He owned photographs of 



partially destroyed starmaps which 
had been found on Saganiu. u 
planet which had been destroyed hy 
a nuclear reaction thousands of 
years previously. Discrepancies in 
the maps suggested to Garamond 
that one star had been of special 
significance to the long-dead Su- 
ganians. and he decided to solve 
the mvstery. 

On completing the four-month 
journey, the Bissendorf s crew made 
an astonishing / bid — a sun com- 
pletely enclosed within a spherical 
shell which was more than 300 
million kilometers in diameters. 
They surveyed the object, located a 
single small entrance at its equator 
and one group passed through it to 
discover that the inner surface of 
the sphere was covered with vegeta- 
tion and had hreatheable air. Hulks 
of hundreds of destroyed space- 
ships were clustered outside the en- 
trance and just inside it were ruins 
of ancient fortifications. A great 
battle had been fought there long 
ago. but there was no sign of life. 

The sphere, dubbed Orbitsville. 
appeared to offer perfect living 
space equivalent to many billions of 
Earths. The discovery > elevated 
Garamond to a level of fame and 
importance at which he and his 
family seemed safe, even from 
Elizabeth Lindstrom. He sent a 
luster-than-light signal to Earth, 
reporting the find, then his science 
team began to investigate some of 
Orbitsville' s mysteries, including 
the puzzle of why radio communi- 



134 



GALAXY 



cation was impossible within the 
sphere. 

Four months later Elizabeth ar- 
rived at the head of a fleet, as- 
sumed control and in a tense inter- 
view with Garamond revealed that 
Star/light intended to exploit emi- 
gration to Orbitsville and parcel it 
out just as if it was a normal planet. 
Settlers begin to arrive almost im- 
mediately. Disillusioned and feeling 
useless. Garamond settled down 
with his family and watched the 
human settlement spread outwards 
into Orbitsville' s infinite prairies — 
then a new discovery was made. 
Orbitsville was not empty and free 
for the taking. An alien civilization 
was encountered close to the en- 
trance. 

XI 

R umors of massacre came within 
a month. 

There had been a short-term lull 
while the shallow circular basin 
centered on Beachhead City ab- 
sorbed the first waves of settlers. 
During that brief respite a handful 
of External Affairs representatives 
had arrived. Aware of their inade- 
quacy, they had ruled that no 
humans were to go within five kilo- 
meters of the alien community until 
negotiations had been completed 
for a corridor to the free territory 
beyond. A number of factors com- 
bined, however, against the efficacy 
of the ruling. The Government men 
had arrived late on the scene. No 



broadcasting media were available 
to them. And — most important — 
there was a widespread feeling 
among the settlers that attempting 
diplomatic communication with the 
Clowns, as they were unofficially 
called, would be an exercise in 
futility. 

At first the bright-hued aliens 
had been approached with caution 
and respect. Then it was learned 
that they possessed no machines 
beyond the simplest farming imple- 
ments. Even their houses were 
woven from a kind of cellulose rope 
extruded from their own bodies in 
roughly the same way a spider pro- 
duces its web. When it was further 
discovered that the Clowns were 
mute, the assumption that they 
were intelligent was called into 
question by many of the human 
settlers. One theory was that they 
were degenerate descendants of the 
race that had built the fortifications 
around the Beachhead City aper- 
ture; another held they were little 
more than domestic animals that 
had outlived their masters and de- 
veloped a quasi-culture of their 
own. 

Garamond was disturbed by the 
attitude implicit in the theories, 
partly because it was a catalyst for 
certain changes taking place among 
the Earth settlers. The subtle loos- 
ening of discipline he had noticed 
in his own men within minutes of 
their setting foot on Orbitsville had 
its counterpart among the immi- 
grants in the form of a growing dis- 



ORBITSVILLE

regard for authority. Men whose 
lives had been closely controlled in 
the tight, compacted society of 
Earth now regarded themselves as 
potential owners of continents and 
were impatient for their new status. 
All they had to do to transform 
themselves from clerks to kings was 
to load up the vehicles provided by 
the Starflight workshops and set 
out on their golden journeys. The 
only directive was that they should 
travel far, because it was obvious 
that the farther a man went when 
fanning out from Beachhead City 
the more land would be available to 
him. 

As the mood took hold, even the 
earliest arrivals — those who had 
staked out their plots of land within 
the circular hills — became uneasily 
aware of the incoming hordes at 
their heels. They decided to move 
onward and outward. 

In a normal planetary situation 
the population pressures would not 
have been concentrated so fiercely 
on one point. But Earth technology 
was geared to the Assumption of 
Mediocrity. During the develop- 
ment of the total transport system 
of flickerwing ships and shuttles it 
had never occurred to anyone to 
make provision for an environment 
in which, for example, it would not 
be possible for a ship to gather its 
own reaction mass. Such provision 
would have been completely illogi- 
cal in the universe as it was then 
understood — but in the contest of 
Orbitsville, a deadly mistake had 



been made. 

Territories of astronomical di- 
mensions were available certainly. 
But no means existed for claiming 
them quickly enough to satisfy the 
ambitions of men who had crossed 
space like gods and then found 
themselves reduced to wheeled 
transportation. Given time to build 
or import fleets of wing-borne air- 
craft. the difficulties could have 
been lessened but not eliminated 
completely. Each family unitor 
commune had to become self-sup- 
porting in the shortest possible time 
and, even with advanced farming 
methods and the use of iron cows, 
this meant claiming possession of 
large areas without delay. 

It was a situation which, classi- 
cally, had always resulted in man 
fighting man. Garamond was not 
surprised therefore when reports 
began to reach him that the outer- 
most settlers had forced their way 
through the Clown city in a number 
of places and were pouring into the 
prairie beyond. Although he did 
not try to visit any of the trouble 
spots in person, he had no difficulty 
visualizing the course of events at 
each. Still haunted by the sense of 
having lost his purpose, he devoted 
most of his time to his family, 
making only occasional visits to the 
Bissendorf in his capacity of chief 
executive. He deliberately avoided 
watching the newscasts piped into 
his home along the landlines, but 
other channels now were open. 

One morning, while sleeping off 



136 



GALAXY 



the effects of a prolonged drinking 
session, he was awakened by a 
child’s scream. The sound triggered 
a synergistic vision of Harald Lind- 
strom falling away from the blind 
face of a statue and, almost in the 
same instant, came the crushing 
awareness that he had not been suf- 
ficiently on his guard against Eliza- 
beth. Garamond jumped out of 
bed, gasping for air, and lurched to 
the living room. Aileen had got 
there before him and was kneeling 
with her arms around Christopher. 
The boy was now sobbing gently, 
his face buried in her shoulder. 

“What happened?” Garamond’s 
fear was subsiding but his heart 
still pounded unevenly. 

“It was the projector,” Aileen 
said. “One of those things appeared 
on it. 1 turned it off.” 

Garamond glanced at the projec- 
tion area of the solid-image tele- 
vision. “What things?” The faint 
ghost of a tutor on one of the edu- 
cational programs was still dissolv- 
ing into the air. 

Christopher raised a streaked, 
solemn face. “It was a Crown." 

“He means a Clown." Aileen’s 
eyes were slaty with anger. 

“A Clown? But ... I told you to 
keep the images fairly diffuse when 
Chris is watching so that he won’t 
get confused between what’s real 
and what isn’t." 

“The image was diffused. The 
thing still scared him, that’s all.” 

Garamond stared helplessly at 
his wife. “I don’t get it. Why 



should he be afraid of a Clown?” 
He turned his attention to Christo- 
pher. ‘‘What’s the matter, son? 
Why were you afraid?” 

“1 thought the Crown was com- 
ing to get me too.” 

“That was a silly thing to think — 
they never harmed anybody.” 

The boy’s gaze was steady and re- 
proachful. “What about all the 
people they froze? All the dead 
people.” 

Garamond was taken aback. 
“What!” 

“Don’t confuse him,” Aileen 
said quietly. “You know perfectly 
well what’s been in the newscasts 
for the last couple of days.” 

"But I don’t! What did they 
say?” 

“They told about the outer 
planet. When the things built Lind- 
stromland, they shut off all light 
and heat to the outer planet and 
froze it over.” 

“Who? What things?" 

“The Clowns, of course.” 

“But that’s wonderful!” Gara- 
mond began to smile. “The Clowns 
created Orbitsvilie!” 

“Their ancestors.” 

“1 see. And there were people on 
the outer planet? People who got 
frozen to death?” 

“They showed photographs of 
them.” A stubborn note had crept 
into Aileen’s voice. 

"Where did they get these photo- 
graphs?" 

“A Starflight ship must have 
gone there, of course." 



ORBITSVILLE 



137 



“But, honey, if the planet is 
frozen over how could anybody take 
photographs of its surface or any- 
thing on it? Just think about that 
for a while.” 

“1 don’t know how they did it. 
I’m only telling you what Chris and 
I and everybody else have seen.” 

Garamond sighed. Going to the 
communicator, he called Cliff 
Napier on board the Bissendorf. 
The familiar head appeared at the 
projection focus and nodded a 
greeting. 

Garamond spoke quickly, with- 
out preamble. “Cliff, 1 need infor- 
mation about ship movements with- 
in the Pengelly’s Star system. Has 
there been an expedition to the 
outer planet?” 

“No.” 

“You’re positive?” 

Napier glanced downward, look- 
ing at an information display. 
“Absolutely.” 

“Thanks, Cliff. That’s all.” 
Garamond broke the connection 
and Napier’s apparently solid fea- 
tures faded into the air. “There you 
are, Aileen — a direct, clear state- 
ment of fact. Now. where are the 
photographs supposed to have come 
from?” 

“Well, perhaps they weren’t 
actual photographs. They might 
have been . .” 

“Artists’ impressions? Recon- 
structions?" 

“What difference does it make? 
They were shown . .” 

"What difference!” Garamond 



laughed shakily as the mental 
chasm opened between himself and 
his wife. Yet he felt no annoyance. 
Their marriage had always been 
simple and harmonious, and he 
knew it was based on deeper attach- 
ments than mere similarity in in- 
terests or outlook. 

One of the first things he had 
learned to accept was the certainty 
of incompleteness on some levels of 
their relationship, and usually he 
knew how to accommodate it. 

“It makes all the difference in 
the world,” he said softly, as if 
speaking to a child. "Don’t you see 
how your attitude toward the 
Clowns has been affected by what 
you've seen or think you’ve seen on 
the viewers? That’s the way people 
are manipulated. It used to be 
more difficult, or at least they had 
to be more subtle when literateness 
was considered vital to educa- 
tion . .” Even to his own ears the 
words sounded dry and irrelevant. 
He stopped speaking as he noticed 
Aileen’s predictable loss of interest. 
His wife absorbed most of her in- 
formation through images, and he 
had no pictures to show her. Gara- 
mond felt an obscure sadness. 

“I’m not stupid, Vance." Aileen 
touched his hand, her intuition in 
sure control. 

“I know.” 

“What did you want to tell me?" 

“I just want you to remember 
that Starflight Incorporated is 
like — ” he strove for a suitably vivid 
image — “like a snowball rolling

down a hill. It keeps getting bigger 
and bigger, and it keeps going 
faster, and it can’t slow down. It 
can’t afford to stop, even when 
somebody gets in the way . and 
that's why it’s going to roll right on 
over the Clowns.” 

I “You always seem so certain 
about things.” 

[ “The signs are all there. The first 
step is to implant in people’s minds 
the idea that the Clowns ought to 
be rolled over. Once that’s been 
done, the rest is easy.” 

"I don’t like the Crowns,” Chris- 
topher said, breaking a long silence. 
His grain-gold face was determined . 

"I’m not asking you to like them, 
son. Just don’t believe that every- 
thing you see on the viewer is real 
and true. Why, if I went to the 



outer planet myself, I could 
Garamond stopped speaking as the 
idea quickly took hold. 



not? After all, that’s the 
W sort of work the S.E.A. 
ships were designed to do,” Eliza- 
beth had said, reasonably, and at 
that point had smiled. “You’re on 
indefinite leave. Captain. But if you 
would prefer to return to active 
service and visit the outer world, 1 
have no objection.” 

“Thank you, my lady," Gara- 
mond had replied, concealing his 
surprise. 

Elizabeth’s imperfect smile had 
grown more secretive, more trium- 
phant. “We will find it useful to

possess some hard data about the 
planet — in place of all the specula- 
tions filling the air.” 

Garamond reviewed the brief 
conversation a number of times as 
the Bissendorf was extending its in- 
visible wings and disengaging from 
fleet formation. It came to him that 
he had proposed the exploratory 
flight partly as a challenge to the 
President, hoping that a duel with 
her would resolve the growing 
doubts in his mind. Her ready 
agreement to the mission was the 
last thing he had expected. As well 
as drawing a few pointed comments 
from Aileen, it had left him feeling 
both disappointed and uneasy. 

He sat in the control gallery for 
hours, watching the bright images 
of the other Starflight ships per- 
form the patient maneuvers that 
would bring each one in turn to the 
entrance of Orbitsville to discharge 
its load of human beings or sup- 
plies. When the Bissendorf s own 
progression had taken it out 
through the regulated swarm, and 
nothing but stars lay in front, 
Garamond remained on station. He 
watched the irregular stabs of the 
main electron gun, the ghostly 
blade of energy that flickered 
through space ahead of the ship. 
The harvest of reaction mass was 
not plentiful in the immediate vi- 
cinity of Pengelly’s Star, so in the 
early stages of the flight it was 
necessary to ionize the cosmic dust 
to help the intake fields do their 
work. 



Gradually, however, as the ship 
spiraled outward, the night-black 
plain of Orbitsville’s shell ceased to 
blank off an entire half of the 
visible universe. The conditions of 
space became more normal. Speed 
began to build up. Once again 
Garamond had difficulty in setting 
his perceptions to the correct scale. 
Everything in his past experience 
conspired to make him think he 
was in a tiny ship painfully 
struggling to a height of a few hun- 
dred kilometers above a normal- 
sized planet, whereas at a hundred 
million kilometers out it was still 
necessary to turn one’s head 
through ninety degrees to take in 
both edges of Orbitsville’s disk. 

The size of the sphere was, in a 
way, painful to Garamond, causing 
familiar questions to seethe again 
in his mind. Was the fact that it 
was large enough to accommodate 
every intelligent being in the home 
galaxy a clue to its purpose? Why 
was there only one entrance to such 
a huge construction? Did the phy- 
sics of the sphere’s existence dictate 
of necessity that neither flickerwing 
ship nor radio communicator could 
operate inside it? Or were those 
features designed in by the Creators 
to preserve the effectiveness of the 
sphere’s size, to prevent ingenious 
technicians turning it into a global 
village with their FTL ships and 
television networks? And where 
were the creators now? 

Napier appeared with two bulbs 
of coffee, handed one to Gara- 



140 



GALAXY 



mond. “The weather section reports 
that the local average density of 
space is increasing according to 
their predictions. That means we 
should be able to pick up enough 
speed to reach the outer planet in 
not much more than a hundred 
hours.” 

Garamond nodded. “The probe 
torpedo should be fitted out by 
then.” 

“Sammy Yamoto wants to lead a 
manned descent to the surface.” 
“That could be dangerous. We’ll 
have to get a better report on the 
surface conditions before authoriz- 
ing anything like that.” Garamond 
sipped coffee, then frowned. “Why 
should our Chief Astronomer want 
to risk his neck out there? I thought 
he was still wrapped up in his 
globular filigree of force fields.” 
“He is. But he reckons he can 
deduce a few things about how 
Orbitsville was built by examining 
the outer planet.” 

“Tell him to keep me posted.” 
Garamond looked at Napier over 
the mouthpiece of his coffee bulb 
and saw an uncharacteristic look of 
hesitancy on the big man’s face. 
“Anything else coming to a boil?” 
“Shrapnel seems to have gone 
AWOL." 

"Shrapnel? The shuttle pilot?” 
“That’s right.” 

“So he took off. Isn’t that what 
we expected?" 

“I expected him to do it once, 
but not twice. He disappeared for 
the best part of a day soon after the 



Starflight crowd first arrived. At 
the time he was on ground detach- 
ment. So I decided he had gone 
back to Starflight with a hard-luck 
story, and 1 wrote him off — but he 
was back on duty again that same 
night.” 

“That surprised you?” 

“It did, especially as he returned 
without the chip on his shoulder. 
His whole attitude seemed to have 
changed for the better. Why, since 
then he’s been working like a 
beaver!” 

“Maybe he discovered he didn’t 
like the Starflight HQ staff.” 
Napier looked unconvinced. “He 
didn’t object or try to cry off when 
orders were posted for this flight, 
but he isn’t on board.” 

“I’d just forget about him.” 
“I’m trying to,” Napier said. 
“But the BissendorJ isn’t a sailing 
ship tied up in harbor. A man able 
to come and go unofficially must 
have organization behind him. It 
makes me think Shrapnel has con- 
tacts in Starflight.” 

“Let’s have some whiskey,” 
Garamond suggested. "We’re both 
getting too old for this type of 
work." 

E ven before it was denied the 
light and heat of its own sun, 
the outer planet of the Pengelly’s 
Star system had been a bleak sterile 
place. 

Less than half the size of Earth, 
it had no atmosphere at all. It was a 
ball of rock and dust patroling a 



ORBITSVILLE 



141 






lonely orbit so far out that its 
parent sun appeared as little more 
than a distant star casting barely 
perceptible shadows in an inert 
landscape. And when that sun 
vanished it made little difference to 
the planet. Its surface became a 
little colder and a little darker, but 
the cooling stresses were not great 
enough to cause anything as spec- 
tacular as movements of the crust. 
Nothing stirred in the blackness ex- 
cept infrequent puffs of dust from 
meteor strikes, and the uneventful 
millenia continued to drag by as 
they had always done. 

Using its radar fans like the 
feelers of a giant insect, the Bissen- 
dorf groped its way into orbit 
around the invisible dead world. 

Garamond’s ship was in the form 
of three equal cylinders joined to- 
gether, the central one projecting 
forward from the other two by 
almost half its length. The com- 
mand deck, administrative and 
technical levels, living quarters and 
workshops were contained in the 
central cylinder. 1'his exposed posi- 
tion meant that the inhabited 
regions of the vessel could have 
been subjected to intense bombard- 
ment during high-speed flight, 
when — due to the ship’s own veloc- 
ity — even stationary motes of inter- 
stellar dust registered as fantas- 
tically energetic particles. The 
problem had been solved by using 
the same magnetic detlection tech- 
niques that guided the particles 
into the ramjet’s thermonuclear re- 



actors. Both the Bissendorf s flux 
pumps shaped their magnetic lines 
of force into the form of a protec- 
tive shield around which the charg- 
ed particles flowed harmlessly into 
the engines. 

An inherent disadvantage of the 
system was that a starship could 
never coast at high speed; with the 
flux pumps closed down, the crew 
would quickly fry in self-induced 
radiation. By the same token, com- 
munications with a ship under way 
were precluded and even radar 
sensing could not be employed. The 
approach to the dark planet had 
been made at modest interplanetary 
speeds, however. Hence the Bissen- 
dorf' was able to proceed by using 
its main drive in short bursts, be- 
tween which it was possible to run 
position checks. Because it was de- 
signed for exploration work in un- 
known planetary systems, the vessel 
was further equipped with conven- 
tional nuclear thrusters and a 
limited amount of stored reaction 
mass which gave it extra capability 
for close maneuvering. The task of 
slipping into stable orbit was there- 
fore accomplished quickly and effi- 
ciently, even though the target 
planet remained invisible to the 
Bissendorf’s crew. 

It took only one pass to enable 
the long-range sensors and record- 
ing banks to answer all Garaniond’s 
questions. 

“Pretty disappointing,” Sammy 
Yamoto mourned, examining the 
glowing numerals and symbols of

the preliminary analysis. “The 
planet has no atmosphere now, ap- 
pears never to have had any. Its 
surface is completely barren. I was 
hoping for the remains of some 
kind of plant life which would have 
told us whether the radiation from 
the primary was cut off suddenly or 
over a period of years.” 

Chief Science Officer O’ Hagan 
spoke. “We can still do a lot with 
samples of dust and rock from the 
surface.” 

Yamoto nodded without enthu- 
siasm. “I guess so. But botanical 
evidence would have been so pre- 
cise. So nice. With nothing but in- 
organic evidence, we’re going to 
have margins of error of — what? A 
thousand years or more?” 

"On an astronomical timescale 
that’s not bad.” 

“It’s not bad, but it’s not . .” 

“Is it the opinion of the group,” 
Garamond interrupted, “that a 
manned descent is still worth 
while?” 

O’ Hagan glanced around at the 
other science officers anchored 
close to the information display, 
then shook his head. “At this stage 
it would be enough to drop a robo- 
lander and take three or four cores. 
Somebody can always go down if 
the cores prove of exceptional 
interest. But I don’t hold out much 
hope they will.” 

“Right — it's decided we send 
down one probe.” Garamond used 
his end-of-meeting voice. “Get it 
there and back as quickly as pos- 



sible, and include flares and holo- 
recording gear in the package. I 
want to be able to present certain 
people with visible evidence.” 

Denise Serra, the physicist, rais- 
ed her eyebrows. “I heard the Star- 
flight Information Bureau was pro- 
pagating some fantasy about a 
beautiful civilization being snuffed 
out in its prime. Naturally I didn’t 
believe it. I mean, who would 
sVvallow an idea like that?” 

“You’d be surprised,” Gara- 
mond told her ruefully. “I’ve been 
learning there are different kinds of 
naivety. We’re subject to one 
kind — it’s an occupational hazard 
associated with spending half your 
life cut off from the big scene. But 
there are other kinds just as dan- 
gerous.” 

“That may be so — but to believe 
that the Clowns created Orbits- 
ville!” 

“Genuine belief isn’t required. 
The story is only a formula that 
allows certain manipulations to be 
carried out. We all know the square 
root of minus one is an unreal 
quantity, and yet we’ve all used it 
when it suited us to do so. Same 
thing.” 

Denise’s eyes twinkled. “Not the 
same at all!” 

“I know. I was just trying to indi- 
cate the general class of thing we 
were talking about.” 

“Neat footwork.” Denise laugh- 
ed outright, and for no reason im- 
mediately apparent to him Gara- 
mond suddenly became aware of 



ORBITSVILLE 



143 



how much he enjoyed simply look- 
ing at her. To him the phrase "easy 
on the eyes” had always been pure 
metaphor. Now he was surprised to 
discover that letting his gaze rest on 
the physicist’s pale sensitive face 
actually did produce a soothing 
sensation in his eyes. The phenom- 
enon entranced and then disturbed 
him. 

When the meeting broke up he 
went to his own quarters. There he 
devoted several hours to his prin- 
cipal spare-time occupation: re- 
cording television interviews for 
Colbert Mason. The reporter, after 
his initial difficulties on Orbitsville, 
had established himself in a posi- 
tion of relative strength, and had 
obtained an office in Beachhead 
City from which he sent back to the 
Two Worlds a prolific stream of 
news stories for syndication. Gara- 
mond cooperated with him, mainly 
because in his estimation his per- 
sonal fame was still his family’s 
best protection against Elizabeth 
Lindstrom. 

There were times when he was 
almost persuaded by Aileen that he 
was wrong in his suspicions of the 
President. But against that were 
persistent rumors that she had slain 
the member of her domestic staff 
who had found her son’s body. 
Garamond continued to maintain 
his defenses. The system was that 
Mason supplied him with tridi 
tapes of recorded questions, and 
when Garamond had time he used 
his own equipment to fill in his 



answers and comments. 

On a number of occasions Mason 
had confessed that he was making a 
fortune from the arrangement. He 
had proposed sharing the profits. 
Garamond had refused to accept 
any money, stipulating only that 
Mason obtain for the stories and 
interviews the widest possible expo- 
sure. It appeared that this objective 
was being achieved. There was a 
growing clamor for the discoverer 
of Lindstromland to make a per- 
sonal appearance to Earth. 

Garamond spent most of the 
current session giving suitable rea- 
sons for not being able to return, 
and describing in precise detail 
what had been learned about the 
invisible outer planet. Assuming 
the material would be safely relayed 
to the Two Worlds by Mason and 
broadcast on the planet-wide net- 
works, it would go a long way 
toward killing any suggestion that 
the Clowns had obliterated an 
entire civilization. 

He stored away the tapes care- 
fully, again pondering the great 
latitude Elizabeth was permitting 
him. Then he fastened himself into 
his bed with the intention of catch- 
ing up on his sleep. 

The slow-drifting cubes of color- 
ed radiance merged and shimmered 
in the air above him, creating hyp- 
notic patterns. Once more there 
came the idea that he might be 
completely wrong about Elizabeth 
Lindstrom, and he found himself 
wishing it were possible to discuss 



144 



GALAXY 



the subject emotionlessly and on an 
intellectual plane with his wife. 
There would be, he decided 
sleepily, no communications prob- 
lem with a woman like Denise Serra 
who shared his background and his 
interests, and who produced that 
curiously pleasant sensation in his 
eyes . 

Garamond slept. 

He awoke two hours later with an 
unaccountable sense of unease. He 
decided to put through a call to 
Aileen and Christopher before go- 
ing to the control gallery. The com- 
munications room made the neces- 
sary connections and in less than a 
minute Garamond was looking at 
the image of his wife. But a winking 
sphere of amber told him he was 
viewing and hearing a recording. It 
said: 

“I was hoping you would call, 
Vance. 1 know you’re on only a 
short trip, but Chris and I have got 
so used to having you with us lately 
that we're spoiled. So the time is 
passing slowly. Something exciting 
has happened, though. You’ll never 
guess.” The unreal Aileen paused 
for a moment, smiling, to demon- 
strate to Garamond his inability to 
divine what was coming next. “I 
had a personal call from the Presi- 
dent — yes, Elizabeth Lindstrom 
herself! She invited Chris and me to 
stay with her in the new Lindstrom 
Center for a few days . .” 

“Don’t go!” Garamond was un- 
able to restrain the words. 

"... knew I’d be feeling lonely 



while you were away,” the image 
was saying contentedly, “but what 
really decided me was that she said 
she was the one who would benefit 
most from the visit. She didn’t 
actually put it into words, but I 
think she is looking forward to 
seeing a child about the place 
again. Anyway, Vance, the Presi- 
dent’s car is calling for us in a few 
minutes. By the time you hear this 
I’ll be wallowing in luxury and high 
living at the Octagon. But don’t 
worry — I'll be at home to cook you 
a meal when you arrive. Love you, 
darling. Bye.” 

The image dissolved into a cloud 
of fading stars, leaving Garamond 
cold, shaken, and angry at his wife. 
“You silly bitch,” he whispered to 
the fleeting points of light. "Why 
do you never, ever, never ever, 
listen to anything I tell you?" 

The last handful of stars vanish- 
ed in silence. 

T he probe torpedo worked its 
way up the gravity hill from the 
dead planet, carrying its samples of 
dust and rock, and homed in on the 
Bissendorf. Although there was a 
sun only three astronomical units 
away, its light was screened off and 
the torpedo was moving through a 
blackness equivalent to that of deep 
interstellar space. 

In that darkness the mother ship 
appeared to some of the probe’s 
sensors as a faint cluster of lights, 
but to other sensors concerned with 
different sections of theelectromag- 



ORBITSVILLE

netic spectrum the ship registered 
as a brilliant beacon whose radia- 
tion embodied many voices com- 
manding, guiding, coaxing the tor- 
pedo homeward. Responding with 
greater and greater precision as the 
electronic voices grew louder, it ap- 
proached the ship with the 
familiarity of a parasite fish flitting 
about a whale. At last it made phy- 
sical contact and was taken on 
board . 

During the final maneuvers 
Garamond had waited on the Bis- 
sendorfs control gallery with grow- 
ing impatience. As soon as the 
signal announcing closure of the 
docking bay was received, he gave 
the order for the main drive to be 
activated. Initial impetus was given 
the ship by the relatively feeble ion 
thrusters, but that propulsion sys- 
tem was shut down when the ramjet 
intake field had been fanned out to 
its maximum area of half-a-million 
square kilometers and reaction 
mass was being scavenged from 
surrounding space. 

As the scooped-up hydrogen and 
other matter were fed into the 
fusion reactors, the ship wheeled 
away sunwards. The acceleration 
restored close-to-normal gravity 
throughout the inhabited levels of 
the central cylinder. 

The feeling of the deck pressing 
firmly on the underside of his feet 
helped Garamond regain his com- 
posure. He assured himself that if 
Elizabeth were to move against his 
family it would be done anywhere 



but in the crystal cloisters of her 
new residence. 

Into the bargain, Elizabeth knew 
that Garamond would be back 
from the dark planet in only a few 
days, imbued with an even greater 
amount — if that were possible — of 
the power called fame. The hours 
and the duty periods went by and, 
as Orbitsville filled the forward 
view panels with its unrelieved 
blackness, Garamond was able to 
satisfy himself that he had panick- 
ed for no good reason. 

The Bissendorf had accomplish- 
ed turnover at midpoint on the 
return journey, and was two days 
into the retardation phase, when 
explosions occurred simultaneously 
in both field generators. The vessel 
was robbed of its means of coming 
to a halt before it would smash into 
the impregnable outer shell of 
Orbitsville.

^npHE starboard explosion was 
M. the worst,” Commander 
Napier reported to the emergency 
meeting of the Bissendorf % execu- 
tive staff. “It actually breached the 
pressure hull in the vicinity of 
Frame S203. The pressure-activat- 
ed doors functioned properly and 
sealed off the section between 
Frames S190 and S210, but there 
were five technicians in there at the 
time and they were killed. 

O’Hagan raised his gray head. 
“Blast or decompression?” 



146 



GALAXY 



“We don’t know. The bodies 
were exhausted into space.” 

O’Hagan made a note on his 
pad. “Five missing, presumed 
dead." 

Napier stared at his old antagon- 
ist with open dislike. “If you know 
how we can turn the ship to recover 
the bodies this would be a good 
time to tell us about it.” 

“I merely . ." 

“Gentlemen!” Garamond slapp- 
ed the table as loudly as possible in 
conditions of almost zero gravity. 
“May I remind you that we are 
scheduled to be killed in about 
eight hours? That doesn’t leave 
much time for bickering.” 

O’Hagan gave a ghastly smile. 
“It gives us eight hours for bicker- 
ing, Captain. There’s nothing else 
we can do.” 

“That’s for this meeting to de- 
cide." 

“So be it.” Chief Science Officer 
O’Hagan shrugged, spread his dry 
knobby hands in resignation. 

Garamond felt a reluctant ad- 
miration for the older man, who 
seemed determined to remain ego- 
tistical and cantankerous right to 
the end. O’Hagan also had a habit 
of being right in everything he said, 
and in that respect too it seemed he 
was going to preserve his record. 
Although reaction mass was not 
plentiful in the region of Pengelly’s 
Star, the Bissendorf had been aided 
in its return journey by the pull of 
the primary and had achieved a 
mean acceleration of close to one 



gravity. So the ship had been travel- 
ing 1,500 kilometers a second at 
turnover point. Although it had 
been slowing down steadily for two 
days when the explosions occurred, 
its residual velocity was still above a 
hundred kilometers a second. At 
that speed the ship was due for im- 
pact with Orbitsville in only eight 
hours. 

Garamond could swear there was 
nothing he or anybody else on 
board could do about it. The 
knowledge of doom boomed and 
pounded through his brain. Yet he 
felt no fear or any related emotion. 
Their absence, he decided, was a 
psychological byproduct of having 
eight hours in hand. The delay 
created an illusion that something 
might still be done, that there was a 
chance to influence the course of 
events. Miraculously, hope held 
good even for an experienced flick- 
erwing man who understood only 
too well the deadly parameters of 
the situation. 

“I understand that both auxiliary 
drive systems are still functional,” 
Administrative Officer Mertz was 
saying, his round face glowing like 
pink plastic. "Surely that makes a 
difference.” 

Napier shook his head. “The ion 
tubes are in action right now — 
which accounts for the slight weight 
we can feel. But those tubes are in- 
tended only to give the ship close- 
maneuvering capability. They won’t 
affect our speed very much. I guess 
the only difference they'll make is 






ORBITSVILLE 



147 



that we'll vaporize against Orbits- 
ville a minute or two later than we 
would otherwise.” 

“Well, what about the secondary 
nuclears? I thought they were for 
collision avoidance.” 

“They are. Maximum endurance 
twenty minutes. By applying full 
thrust at right angles to our present 
course we could easily avoid an ob- 
ject as large as Jupiter — but we’re 
dealing with that!” Napier pointed 
at the forward view panels, which 
were uniformly black. Orbitsville 
spanned the universe. 

Mertz’s face had lost some of its 
pinkness. “I get the picture. 
Thanks.” 

The operations room was silent 
except for faint irregular clangs 
transmitted through the ship’s 
structure. Far aft, a repair crew 
was at work replacing the damaged 
hull sections. Garamond stared 
into the darkness ahead and tried 
to assimilate the idea that it repre- 
sented a wall across the sky, a wall 
rushing toward him at a hundred 
kilometers a second, a wall so wide 
and high there was no way to avoid 
hitting it. 

Yamoto cleared his throat. 
“There’s no point speculating why 
the ship was sabotaged. Still, I’m 
curious. Do we know how the 
bombs got aboard?” 

“1 personally believe it was the 
work of Pilot Officer Shrapnel,” 
Napier said. “There isn’t much evi- 
dence, but what there is points to 
him. We mentioned our suspicions 



in our emergency call to Fleet Con 
trol.” 

“What did they say?” 

“They promised he would be in- 
vestigated.” Napier’s voice had a 
flinty edge of bitterness. “We are 
assured that all necessary steps will 
be taken.” 

“That’s good to know. Isn’t that 
good to know?” Yamoto pressed 
the back of a hand to his forehead. 
“1 had so much work still to do. 
There was so much to learn about 
Orbitsville.” 

They’re going to learn at least 
one thing as a result of this mission, 
Garamond thought. They're going 
to find out how the shell material 
stands up to the impact of fifteen 
thousand tons of metal traveling at 
a hundred kilometers a second. 
And they won't even have to go far 
from the aperture to see the big 
bang . Garamond felt an icy 
convulsion in his stomach as he 
half-glimpsed an idea. He sat per- 
fectly still for a moment as the in- 
credible thought began to form, to 
crystallize to the point at which it 
could be put into words. His brow 
grew chill with sweat. 

•“Has anybody," Denise Serra 
asked in a calm, clear voice, “con- 
sidered the possibility of adjusting 
our course in such a way that we 
would pass through the aperture at 
Beachhead City?” 

Again the room filled with si- 
lence. Garamond felt a curious sec- 
ondary shock on hearing the words 
he was still formulating being 



148 



GALAXY 



uttered by another person. The 
silence lasted for perhaps ten 
seconds, then was broken by a dry 
laugh from O’ Hagan. 

^¥tou realize that at our speed, 
j[ Miss Serra, running into a 
wall of air would be just like hitting 
solid rock? I’m afraid your idea 
doesn’t change anything.” 

“We don’t have to run into a wall 
of air. Not if we turn the ship over 
again and go in nose first with the 
electron gun operating at full 
power.” 

“Nonsense!” O’Hagan shouted. 
He cocked his head to one side as if 
listening to an inner voice, and his 
fingers moved briefly on the com- 
puter terminal before him. “It isn’t 
nonsense, though.” He corrected 
himself without embarrassment, 
nodding his apologies to Denise 
Serra. Others at the conference 
table promptly began to address 
the central computer through their 
own terminals. 

Suddenly everyone was trying to 
speak. 

“Overload power on the gun 
should give us enough voltage for 
the few seconds we would need it. It 
should be enough to blast a tunnel 
through the atmosphere — ’’ 

“At this stage we have enough 
lateral control over our flight path 
to bring it through the aperture — ” 
“But remember we haven’t got 
the full area of the aperture as a 
target. We’d be going in at an angle 
of about seventy degrees — ’’ 



“It’s still good enough — as long 
as no other ships get in the way — ” 
"There’s still time to do some 
structural strengthening on the 
longtitudinal axis — ” 

“We’ll shed enough kinetic 
energy ...” 

“Hold it a minute,” Garamond 
commanded, raising his voice above 
the optimistic clamor. “We have to 
look at it from all angles. If we did 
go through the aperture, what 
would be the effect on Beachhead 
City?” 

“Severe,” O’Hagan said reflec- 
tively. “Imagine one purple hell of 
a lightning bolt coming up through 
the aperture, immediately followed 
by an explosion equivalent to that 
produced by a tactical nuclear 
weapon.” 

“There'd be destruction?" 
“Undoubtedly. But there’s plenty 
of time to evacuate the area — no- 
body would have to die.” 
“Somebody mentioned colliding 
with another ship." 

“That’s only a minor problem, 
Vance.” O’Hagan looked momen- 
tarily surprised at having used 
Garamond’s given name for the 
first time in his life. "We can advise 
Fleet Control of our exact course, 
and they’ll just have to make cer- 
tain the way is clear.” 

Garamond tried to weigh the 
considerations but he could see 
only the faces of his wife and child. 
“Right! We do it. I want a copy of 
the decision network plan, but start 
taking action right away. In the 



ORBITSVILLE 



149 



meantime I’ll talk to Fleet Con- 
trol.” 

The ten science-oriented and en- 
gineering officers at the table in- 
stantly launched into a polygonal 
discussion. The noise level in the 
room further shot up as communi- 
cations channels were opened to 
other parts of the ship. Within a 
minute perhaps thirty other men 
and women were taking part in the 
conference, many of them vicari- 
ously present in the form of minia- 
turized, but nonetheless solid and 
real-looking, images of their heads, 
which transformed the long room 
into a montage of crazy perspec- 
tives. 

Garamond could feel the wave- 
crest of hope surging through all 
the levels of the disabled vessel. He 
told Napier to make an announce- 
ment about the situation over the 
general address speakers, then went 
into his private suite and put 
through a call to Fleet Control. It 
was taken not by the Fleet Move- 
ments Controller, as Garamond 
had expected, but by a Starflight 
admin man. Senior Secretary Lord 
Nettleton. The Senior Secretary 
was a handsome silver-haired sep- 
tuagenarian who had a reputation 
for devotion to the Lindstrom hier- 
archy. He was of a type that Eliza- 
beth liked to have around, capable 
of presenting a benign fatherly 
image while keeping himself remote 
from the inner workings of the 
system. 

“I was expecting somebody on 



the operations side,” Garamond 
said, dispensing with the standard 
formal mode of address. 

“The President has taken the 
matter under her personal control. 
She is very much concerned." 

“I’ll bet.” 

“I beg your pardon?” Nettleton’s 
resonant voice betrayed an open 
challenge to Garamond to speak 
his mind. 

Again Garamond thought about 
his wife and child. “The President’s 
concern for the welfare of her 
employees is well known.” 

Nettleton inclined his head gra- 
ciously. “I’m aware of how futile 
words are under the circumstances, 
Captain Garamond. But I would 
like to express my personal sym- 
pathy for you and your crew in 
this . 

“The reason I called is to inform 
Starflight that the Bissendorf has 
enough lateral control to enable it 
to pass through the aperture into 
the interior of Orbits — uh — Lind- 
stromland, and that is what I 
intend to do.” 

“I don’t quite understand.” Net- 
tleton’s image underwent several 
minute but abrupt changes of size 
that told Garamond other viewers 
were switching into the circuit. “I 
am informed that you are traveling 
at a hundred kilometers per second 
and have no means of slowing 
down.” 

“That’s correct. The Bissendorf 
is going to hit Beachhead City like a 
bomb. You will have to evacuate 



150 



GALAXY 



the area around the aperture. My 
science staff can help with the esti- 
mates of how widespread the dam- 
age will be, but in any case I 
strongly recommend that you issue 
warnings immediately. You have 
less than eight hours.” Garamond 
went on to explain the proposed 
action in detail, while continued 
perturbations of the image showed 
that his unseen audience was in- 
creasing every second. 

“Captain, what happens if your 
ship misses the aperture and strikes 
the shell material below the city it- 
self?" 

"We are confident of passing 
through the aperture." 

"All you’re saying is that the 
probability is high. But suppose 
you do miss?” 

“It is our opinion that the shell 
would be undamaged.” 

“But the shell is one of the great- 
est scientific enigmas ever! On what 
do you base your predictions about 
its behavior under that sort of 
impact?” 

Garamond allowed himself a 
smile. “In the last hour or so our in- 
stinct about these things has be- 
come highly developed.” 

"This is hardly a time for jokes.” 
Nettleton looked away for a mo- 
ment, nodded to someone off 
screen. When he turned back to 
Garamond his eyes were somber. 
“Captain, have you thought about 
the possibility that Starflight may 
not be able to grant you permission 
to aim for the aperture?” 



Garamond considered the ques- 
tion. “No — but I've thought about 
the fact that there is absolutely 
nothing Starflight can do to stop 
me.” 

Nettleton shook his head with 
regal sadness. "Captain, I’m going 
to put you through to the President 
on a direct connection.” 

"I haven’t the time to speak to 
Liz,” Garamond told him. “Just 
send a message to my wife that I’ll 
be back with her as soon as I can.” 
He broke the connection and re- 
turned to the operations room, 
hoping he had sounded more con- 
fident than he felt. 

I indstrom Center was austere 
j compared to its equivalent on 
Earth. Nevertheless it was the 
largest and most palatial building 
on Orbitsville. Octagonal in plan, it 
had been built on a slight eminence 
some twenty kilometers east of 
Beachhead City, to which it was 
joined by power and communica- 
tions cables stretched on low py- 
lons. No attempt had yet been 
made to sculpt the hill according to 
the President’s ideas of what it 
ought to be, sotheglass-and-acrylic 
edifice was incongruously lapped 
by a sea of grass. Its first three 
floors housed those elements of the 
Starflight administration that the 
supreme executive had transported 
from the Two Worlds. The top 
floor was her private residence. 

On this evening, the guards who 
patroled the perimeter fence were 



ORBITSVILLE 



151 



distinctly uneasy. They had heard 
that a maniac of a flickerwing cap- 
tain was going to try to crash his 
vessel through the aperture at inter- 
planetary speed, and the rumor 
had even quoted an exact minute 
for the event to occur — 20.06 Com- 
patible Local Time. As the moment 
grew nearer each man felt a power- 
ful urge to fix his gaze on the dis- 
tant scattering of buildings, just 
below the up-curved horizon, which 
was Beachhead City. They had 
been told that most of the city had 
been hastily evacuated to escape 
the promised pyrotechnics, and no- 
body wanted to miss the spectacle. 

At the same time, however, their 
eyes were frequently drawn upward 
to the transparent west wall of the 
Presidential suite. Elizabeth Lind- 
strom herself could be glimpsed up 
there, screened only by sky reflec- 
tions, her silk-sheathed abdomen 
glowing like a pearl. It was well 
known that she sometimes kept 
watch on her guards through a 
magnifying screen. None of the 
men relished the idea of being dis- 
missed from Starfiight service and 
sent back to the crowded tower- 
blocks of Earth; yet the compulsion 
to stare into the west grew greater 
with each passing minute. 

The suspense was also making 
itself felt on the top floor of the 
Octagon. But in the case of Eliza- 
beth Lindstrom it was a pleasurable 
sensation, heady and stimulating, 
akin to pre-orgasmic tension. 

“My dear,” she said warmly to 



Aileen Garamond, “do you think 
you are wise to watch this?” 
“Quite sure. My Lady.” 

“But the boy . .” 

“I’m positive my husband knows 
what he is doing.” Aileen’s voice 
was firm and unemotional as she 
placed her hands on her son’s 
shoulders, forcing him to face the 
west. “Nothing will go wrong.” 

“1 admire your courage, es- 
pecially when the chances are 
so . .” Elizabeth checked herself 
just in time. The common charac- 
terless woman beside her appeared 
genuinely to believe that a ship 
could run into a solid wall of air at 
a speed of a hundred kilometers a 
second and not be destroyed on the 
instant. Elizabeth was girded with 
the mathematics that showed how 
incredible the idea was, but she 
knew the equations would mean 
nothing to her guest. In any case, 
she had no desire to break the news 
in advance. She wanted to watch 
Mrs. Garamond’s face as she saw 
her husband’s funeral pyre blossom 
on the horizon. Only then would 
Elizabeth receive the first payment 
against the incalculable debt the 
Garamond family owed her. 

The idea of grief canceling grief, 
of pain atoning for pain, was one 
that few people could properly 
understand, Elizabeth had often 
told herself. Even she had not ap- 
preciated the logic of it until days 
after Harald’s small body had been 
cast in sun-colored resin and stood 
in its place in the Lindstrom 



152 



GALAXY 



chapel. But the concept was so 
true! 

There were no flaws in the system 
of double entries — anguish against 
anguish, love against love. This 
realization had given Elizabeth the 
strength to go on even when it ap- 
peared that the Garamonds had 
chosen to die in the black deeps of 
space. That episode had been 
nothing more and nothing less than 
God’s way of telling her that he was 
simply building up the Garamond's 
credit to the point at which it could 
be used to wipe out all their debts. 
In retrospect, it had been fortunate 
that she had not been able to 
extract payment immediately, be- 
cause there would still have been an 
imbalance and she would never 
have found her heart’s ease. A child 
is a focus, a repository of love 
added to each year of its life, and it 
was crystal-clear that the death of a 
boy of nine could never be compen- 
sated for by the death of a boy 
of . 

“I have the latest computations 
for you, My Lady.” The projected 
voice of Lord Nettleton broke in on 
Elizabeth’s thoughts. “The impact 
will occur in exactly three minutes 
from . now.” 

“Three minutes,” Elizabeth said 
aloud, knowing that the accurately 
beamed sound would not have 
reached the other woman’s ears. 
Without giving any sign that she 
had heard, Aileen picked up her 
son so that her face was screened by 
the boy’s body. Elizabeth moved 



quietly to the other side, as was her 
due, and waited. 

She waited through eons and 
eternities. 

And the ribbed canopy of the sky 
ceased to turn. 

Time was dead . 

T he lightning bolt came first. An 
arrow-straight line of hell. Sear- 
ing upward at an angle into the 
heavens. Isolated for the first per- 
ceptible instant, then joined by 
writhing offshoots, tributaries and 
deltas of violet fire that flickered 
and froze on the retina. Faint 
shadows fled across the sky as the 
air above Beachhead City was tur- 
moiled by the fountain of energy. 

Appalling though the general 
display was, there was projected 
from its core, on the threshold of 
vision, a sense of even greater 
forces in the shock of opposition. 
There was a feeling of cataclysmic 
upward movement, then a bright 
star burned briefly and dwindled in 
the southwest. The day returned to 
normalcy, though darker than it 
had been before. 

Elizabeth drew a deep quavering 
breath. No other death she had ever 
witnessed had been so final. She 
turned her gaze to Aileen Gara- 
mond’s face, and was shocked to 
see there a look of serenity. 

“It was to be expected,” she 
said. 

“I know.” Aileen nodded con- 
tentedly, and hugged her child. “I 
told you.” 



ORBITSVILLE 



153 



Elizabeth gaped at her. “You 
fool! You don’t think he’s still alive 
after what you’ve just . She 
was forced to stop speaking as the 
waves of thunder rolling out from 
Beachhead City, slow-moving in 
the low-pressure air of Orbitsville, 
engulfed the building. Reflections 
of lights stretched and shrank and 
stretched again as the transparent 
walls absorbed energy. Small ob- 
jects throughout the room stirred 
uneasily in their places. Christo- 
pher buried his face in his mother’s 
hair. 

"Your husband is dead,” Eliza- 
beth announced when silence was 
restored to the room. “But because 
you are the widow of the most dis- 
tinguished of all my S.E.A. cap- 
tains, you will remain here as my 
guest. No other arrangement would 
be acceptable.” 

Aileen faced her, pale but im- 
movable. “My Lady, you are mis- 
taken. You see — I know!” 

Elizabeth shook her head incred- 
ulously and a little sadly. She had 
been planning to spend perhaps a 
year in a game of subtleties and 
suggestions, watching the other 
woman’s slow progression from 
doubt to certainty about her son’s 
eventual fate. But in view of Aileen 
Garamond’s mentality, or lack of 
it, it was obvious now that such 
strategies would be ineffective. If 
full payment were to be extracted, 
as God as decreed, the President 
would have to speak plainly, to the 
point. 



Elizabeth touched a beautiful 
micro-engineered ring on her left 
hand, insuring that no listening de- 
vices could operate nearby. Then 
she explained in words a child 
could understand the accountancy 
of retribution. Christopher Gara- 
mond would be allowed another 
three years. He was to have the 
same lifespan as Harald Lind- 
strom — but not a day more. 

When she had finished, she 
summoned her physician. “Captain 
Garamond’s death has left Mrs. 
Garamond in a state of hysteria. 
Give her suitable sedation.” 
Aileen opened her mouth to 
scream. But the physician, an ex- 
perienced man, touched her wrist 
in a quick movement that did not 
even disturb the boy she was 
holding in her arms. As the cloud 
of instant-acting drug diffused 
through her skin, Aileen relaxed 
and allowed herself to be led away. 

Alone again, Elizabeth Lind- 
strom stood looking out across the 
western grasslands. For the first 
time in more than a year, she was 
feeling something approaching 
happiness. She began to smile. 

XIII 

T he integrity of the Bissendorfs 
design was so great, and the on- 
board preparation had been so 
thorough, that less than a tenth of 
the crew died as a result of the 
passage through the eye of the 
needle. 



154 



GALAXY 



Every available man and woman 
had been co-opted into teams. 
Some had welded into place new 
| computer-designed structures, 
making load paths actually utiliz- 
ing the forces of the impact to give 
the shell enough strength to survive. 
Until only minutes before the hellish 
transit, other gangs had swarmed 
on the skin of the ship, adding hun- 
dreds of sacrificial anodes to those 
already in place to serve as focal 
points for the ion exchanges that 
otherwise would have eaten away 
the hull during normal flight. The 
new anodes, massive slabs of pure 
metal, had withstood the brief but 
incredibly fierce attrition of the 
lightning wreathing the ship as it 
had passed through the atmos- 
pheric tunnel created by its electron 
gun. On emerging from its ordeal 
the Bissendorf's principal dimen- 
i sions had altered, in some cases by 
several meters. But it had gone in 
with all pressure doors sealed — in 
effect it had been converted into 
dozens of separate, self-contained 
spaceships — and there had been no 
loss of life due to compression. 

The entire crew had donned 
spacesuits for primary protection, 
had been injected with metallic 
salts. The ship’s restraint fields had 
been stepped up fo overload inten- 
sity, creating an environment in 
which any sudden movement of 
human tissue would be resisted by a 
pervasive jelly-like pressure from 
all sides. This measure, while un- 
doubtedly a major factor in crew 



survival, also unavoidably caused a 
number of deaths. In the few sec- 
tions where severe structural failure 
occurred some of the occupants 
had “fallen” varying distances 
under multiple gravities, and the 
heat induced by electromotive in- 
teraction had caused their blood to 
boil. But for the vast majority the 
internal bracing of their organs 
against immense G-shocks had 
meant the differences between life 
and death. 

And yet all the preparation, all 
the frenzied activity, would have 
amounted to nothing more than a 
temporary stay of execution had it 
not been for the exotic nature of 
Orbitsville itself. 

The synthetic gravity of the shell 
material attenuated much more 
rapidly than that of a solid mass. 
Although the Bissendorf's slanting 
course was drawn into the shape of 
a parabola, the curve remained 
flat. So the crew had sufficient time 
to control their reentry into the at- 
mosphere from the inner vacuum of 
Orbitsville. The vessel’s ion tubes 
and short-term reaction motors 
were effective against the weak pull 
of the shell, and it was possible for 
the Bissendorf to skip along the 
upper fringes of the air shield, 
gradually shedding velocity. It was 
even possible, using the fading re- 
serves of reaction mass, to bring the 
ship down in one piece, with no 
further loss of life. 

What was manifestly impossible, 
however, was to make the ship fly 



ORBITSVILLE 



155 



again. All its external sensors had 
been seared cleanly from the hull. 
Many of the internal position-fixing 
devices had been destroyed or con- 
fused by the unnatural physics of 
Orbitsville. 

Of course, the clocks were still in 
operation. They had recorded a 
time lapse of five days. Five days 
from the passage through the 
Beachhead City aperture to the 
final touchdown on a hillside far 
into the interior. Starting from that 
basic fact, and using only a pocket 
calculator, it took just a few seconds 
for those on board to realize that 
they had traveled a distance of 
more than fifteen million kilometers 
from the aperture. 

In terms of the overall size of 
Orbitsville the journey was infinit- 
esmal. A short hop, a stone’s 
throw, a jump across sunlit grass 
and woodlands. But in human 
terms the distance was more of a 
barrier than mountains or torrents. 
It was known, for instance, that 
back on Earth many a country 
postman had in his lifetime walked 
a total distance equal to a trip to 
the Moon, but that was only 
385,000 kilometers. Walking back 
to Beachhead City would have been 
a task to be carried out by succes- 
sive generations over a period of a 
thousand years. 

Using the vast resources of the 
Bissendorfs workshops it would be 
possible to build a fleet of vehicles 
that might cut the journey time 
down to a mere century — except 



that wheels and other components 
would wear out in a matter of 
months. It would not be possible to 
transport the maintenance and 
manufacturing facilities that might 
enable the caravan to complete its 
golden journey. 

There was also the difficulty that 
no man or machine knew the exact 
direction in which to travel. It was 
possible to get a rough bearing 
from the angle of the day and night 
ribs across the sky, but a rough 
bearing would be of no value. At 
the distances involved, a deviation 
of only one degree w'ould cause the 
train to miss Beachhead City by 
hundreds of thousands of sun- 
drenched kilometers. 

By the time the dead had been 
buried, the day was well advanced. 
The remaining men and women of 
the Bissendorfs crew were ceasing 
to be citizens of Earth. They were 
experiencing the infinity-change, 
the wistful, still contentment be- 
stowed by the motionless sun of 
Orbitsville. Garamond bethought 
himself of a verse: 

. that calm Sunday that 
goes on and on, 

When even lovers find their 
peace at last. 

And Earth is but a star, that 
once had shone. 

XIV 

iiWJ E RE going back,” Gara- 
W mond announced flatly.

GALAXY 



He studied the faces of his execu- 
tive staff, noting how each officer 
was reacting. Some looked at him 
with open amusement, others stared 
downward into the grass, seemingly 
embarrassed. Behind them, farther 
along the hillside, the great scarred 
hulk of the Bissendorf shocked the 
eye. Beyond it, microscopic figures 
moved on the plain in the rituals of 
a ball game. The sun hung directly 
overhead, as always, creating only 
an occasional flicker of diamond- 
fire on the dark-blue waters of a 
chain of lakes banding the middle 
distance. 

Garamond began to feel that his 
words had been absorbed by Or- 
bitsville’s green infinities, sucked 
up cleanly before they reached the 
ears of his listeners. He resisted the 
urge to repeat himself. 

“It’s a hell of a long way,” 
Napier said, finally breaking the 
heavy silence. His statement of the 
obvious, Garamond knew, consti- 
tuted a question. 

“We’ll build aircraft.” 

O'Hagan cleared his throat. ‘Tve 
already thought of that, Vance. We 
have enough workshop facilities 
still intact to manufacture reason- 
able subsonic aircraft, and the 
micropedia can give us all the de- 
sign data. But the distance is just 
too great. You run into exactly the 
same problem as with wheeled 
vehicles. Your aircraft might do the 
trip in three or four years — except 
that we haven’t the resources to 
build a plane that could fly contin- 



uously for that length of time. And 
we couldn’t transport major repair 
facilities." O’Hagan glanced 
solemnly around the rest of the 
group, reproving them for having 
left it to him to deal with a wayward 
non-scientist. 

Garamond shook his head. 
“When I said we are going back, I 
didn’t mean all of us, in a body. I 
meant that 1 am going back, 
together with any of the crew suffi- 
ciently determined to try it — even if 
that means only half a dozen of 
us.” 

"But . ." 

“We’re going to build a fleet of 
perhaps ten aircraft. We’re going 
to incorporate as much redundancy 
as is compatible with good aerody- 
namics. We’re going to fly our ten 
machines towards Beachhead City, 
and each time one of them breaks 
down we’re going to take the best 
components out of it and put them 
in the other machines, and we’re 
going to fly on.” 

"There’s no guarantee you’ll get 
there, even with the last aircraft.” 

“There’s no guarantee 1 won't.” 

“I’m afraid there is.” O’Hagan’s 
expression had become even more 
pained. "There’s this problem of 
direction. Unless you’ve got a really 
accurate bearing on Beachhead 
City, there’s no point in setting 
out." 

“I'm not worried about getting a 
precise bearing,” Garamond said, 
making a conscious decision to be 
enigmatic. He was aware that in the 



ORBITSVILLE 



157 



very special circumstances of the 
Bissendorf s final flight the whole 
concept of command structure, of 
the captain-and-crew relationship, 
could have easily lost its validity. It 
was necessary at this stage to rees- 
tablish himself in office without the 
aid of insignia or outside authority. 

“How do you propose to get 
one?” 

“I propose instructing my science 
staff to attend to that chore for me. 
There’s an old saying about the 
pointlessness of owning a dog and 
doing your own barking.” Gara- 
mond fixed a challenging gaze in 
turn on O’Hagan, Sammy Yamoto, 
Morrison, Schneider and Denise 
Serra. He noted with satisfaction 
that they were responding as he had 
hoped. Already there were signs of 
abstraction, of withdrawal to a pla- 
teau of thought upon which they 
became hunters casting nets for a 
quarry they had never seen but 
would recognize at first sight. 

"While they’re sorting that one 
out,” Garamond continued, speak- 
ing to Napier before any of the 
science staff could voice objections, 
“we’ll convene a separate meeting 
of the engineering committee. The 
ship has to be cut up to get the 
workshop floors level. In the mean- 
time I want the design definition 
drawn up for the aircraft and the 
first production tapes prepared." 
He walked toward the improvised 
plastic hut he was using as an 
office. Napier, striding beside him, 
gave a dry cough. 



“TB again?” Garamond said 
with mock sympathy. 

“I think you’re going too fast, 
Vance. Concentrating too much on 
the nuts and bolts, and not think- 
ing enough about the human ele- 
ment.” 

“Be more specific. Cliff.” 

“A lot of the crew have got the 
Orbitsville syndrome already. They 
don’t see any prospect of getting 
back to Beachhead City, and many 
don’t even want to get back. They 
see no reason for not setting up a 
community right here, using the 
Bissendorf &s a mine for essential 
materials.” 

Garamond stopped, shielded his 
eyes and looked beyond the ship 
toward the plot of land, marked 
with a silver cross, where forty men 
and women had been buried. “I 
can understand their feelings, and 
I’m not proposing to ride herd on 
those who want to stay. We’ll use 
volunteers only.” 

“There could be fewer than you 
expect.” 

“Surely some of them, many of 
them, have reasons for getting 
back.” 

“The point is that you aren’t pro- 
posing to get them back, Vance. 
The planes won’t make it all the 
way. So you’re asking them to 
choose between staying here in a 
strong sizable community with re- 
sources of power, materials and 
food — or being dropped somewhere 
between here and Beachhead City 
in groups of ten or less, with very 



158 



GALAXY 



little to get them started as inde- 
pendent communities.” 

“Each plane will have to carry an 
iron cow and a small plastics 
plant.” 

“It’s still a hell of a lot to ask.” 
‘Til also guarantee that a rescue 
mission will set out as soon as I get 
back.” 

“If you get back. And how can 
you give guaranties? You’ve got 
enemies there.” 

A dark thought crossed Gara- 
mond’s mind. “How about you, 
Cliff? Are you coming with me?” 

“You know it! All I’m trying to 
do is make you realize there’s more 
to the thing than finding the right 
engineering approach." 

“I realize that already. But right 
now I have all the human problems 
1 can handle. The personal kind, I 
mean.” 

“Others have wives and families 
they want to get back to,” comfort- 
ed Napier. 

“That’s the point — I haven’t.” 

“But . Aileen. And little 
Chris . .” 

“How long do you think they’ll 
survive after I’m presumed dead or 
permanently missing? A week? A 
day?” Garamond forced himself to 
speak steadily despite the grief 
thundering through him. “The only 
reason I'm going back is that I 
must kill Liz Lindstrom.” 

although it had been equipped 
/V. and powered to carry out one 
emergency landing, the Bissendorf 



was in a supremely unnatural atti- 
tude when beached with its longi- 
tudinal axis at right angles to the 
pull of gravity. The interior layout 
was based on the assumption that, 
except during short spells of 
weightlessness, there would be ac- 
celeration or retardation enabling 
the crew to regard the prow as 
pointing “up” and to walk nor- 
mally on all its levels. Now the 
multitudinous floors of the vessel 
had become vertical walls. To these 
were attached, in surrealistic -atti- 
tudes, clusters of consoles, pedes- 
tals, desks, chairs, lockers, beds, 
tables and several hundred ma- 
chines of various types and capa- 
bilities. 

Because design allowance had 
been made for periods of free-fall, 
most small items, including paper- 
work, were magnetically or other- 
wise clamped in position. Thus 
little material had fallen to the 
lowermost side of the hull. But 
many of the ship’s resources could 
not be tapped until key areas were 
properly oriented to the ground. 

Teams of forcemasters using 
valency cutters and improvised der- 
ricks began slicing the Bissendorf s 
structure into manageable sections 
and rotating them to horizontal 
positions. The work was slowed by 
the need to sever and reconnect 
power channels. But within a week 
the cylinder of the central hull had 
been largely converted into a cluster 
of low circular or wedge-shaped 
buildings. Each was roofed with a 



ORBITSVILLE 



159 



plastic diaphragm and linked by 
cable to power sources on the 
ground or within the butchered 
ship. The entire complex was sur- 
rounded by an umbra of tents and 
extemporized plastic sheds that 
gave it the appearance of an army 
encampment. 

Garamond had placed maximum 
priority on the design and workshop 
facilities that were to create his 
aircraft. Work advanced with a 
speed that would have been impos- 
sible even a century earlier. The 
assembly line was already visible as 
nine sets of landing skids sur- 
mounted by the sketchy cruciforms 
of the basic airframes. 

The computers from the space- 
ship had decreed that the stressed- 
skin principle of aircraft construc- 
tion. currently universal to avia- 
tion, should be abandoned in favor 
of the frame-and-fabric techniques 
employed in the Wright Brothers 
era. This permitted most techno- 
logical and engineering subtlety to 
be concentrated in a dozen pieces 
of alloy per craft, and the tape- 
controlled radiation millers hewed 
these from fresh billets in less than 
a day. The plastic skinning could 
then be carried out to the standards 
of a good-quality furniture shop 
and the engines — standard mag- 
netic pulse prime-movers — fitted 
straight from the shelf. It was the 
availability of these engines, of 
which there were twenty-one in the 
Bissendorfs inventory, that had 
been the main parameter in decid- 



ing upon a fleet of nine twin-engin- 
ed ships which would set out on the 
journey with three powerplants in 
reserve. 

G aramond, sitting alone in the 
prismatic twilight at the en- 
trance to his tent, was halfway 
through a bottle of whiskey when 
he heard someone approaching. 
The nights never became truly dark 
under the striped canopy of Orbits- 
ville’s sky, and he was able to recog- 
nize the compact figure of Denise 
Serra while she was still some dis- 
tance away. His annoyance at being 
disturbed faded somewhat but he 
sat perfectly still, making no sign of 
welcome. The whiskey was his 
guarantee of sleep and to bring 
about the desired effect it had to be 
taken in precise rhythmic doses, 
with no interruptions to the ritual. 

Denise reached the tent, stood 
for a moment without speaking 
while she assessed his mood, then 
sat down in the grass at the oppo- 
site side of the entrance. Appreciat- 
ing her silence, Garamond waited 
till his instincts prompted him to 
take another measure of the spirit’s 
cool fire. He raised the bottle to his 
lips. 

‘‘Drinking that way can’t be 
good for you,’’ Denise said. 

“On the contrary — it’s excellent 
for me.” 

“1 never got to like whiskey. 
Especially the stuff Burton makes.” 
Garamond took his slightly de- 
layed drink. “It’s all right if you 



160 



GALAXY 



know how to use it.” 

“Use it? Aren’t you supposed to 
enjoy it?” 

“It’s more important to me to 
know how to use it.” 

She sighed. “I’m sorry. I know 
you must feel awful, being separat- 
ed from . .” 

“What did you want, Denise?” 

“A child, I think.” 

Garamond knew himself to have 
been rendered emotionally sterile 
by despair for his family. Yet he 
still retained enough humanity to 
feel obliged to cap his bottle and set 
it aside. 

“It's a bad time,” he said. 

“Yes, but that’s the way I feel. It 
must be this place. It must be the 
Orbitsville syndrome that Cliff 
keeps talking about. We’re here, 
and a new universe is all around us, 
forever, and things I used to think 
important now seem trivial. And 
for the first time in my life I want a 
child.” 

Garamond stared at the girl 
through the veils of soft blue air. A 
part of his mind, despite the 
pounding chaos of the rest, was in- 
tensely aware of her. It was difficult 
to pick out a single special attribute 
of Denise Serra but the overall 
effect was overpowering. She was a 
lovely neat package of femininity, 
intelligence and warmth, and he 
felt ashamed of having nothing to 
offer her. 

“It’s still a bad time,” he said. 

"I know. We all know that, but 
some of the other women are drink- 



ing untreated water. It’s only a 
matter of time till they become 
pregnant.” Her eyes watched him 
steadily and he remembered how, 
in that previous existence, it had 
given him pleasure to look at her. 

“Haven’t you already got a part- 
ner, Denise?” 

“You know I haven’t.” 

That's it into the open, he 
thought. Forme to know that of all 
the female crew members, Denise 
Serra had no liaisons. I would have 
to have been taking a special 
interest in her. 

• “1 guess I did know.” Garamond 
hesitated. “Denise, I feel . .” 
“Honored?” 

“I think that’s the word.” 

“Say no more, Vance. I know 
what it means when somebody 
starts off by feeling honored. I've 
done it myself.” She stood up in 
one easy movement. 

Garamond tried for something 
less abrupt, and knew he was being 
clumsy. “Maybe in a year, a few 
months ..." 

"The special unrepeatable offer 
will be lost to you before then,” 
Denise said, an uncharacteristic 
harshness in her voice. “Have you 
thought about what you’re going to 
do if we can’t get a bearing on 
Beachhead City, if your flight never 
gets off the ground?" 

“I’m counting on your getting 
that bearing.” 

“Don’t!” She turned quickly, 
walked away a few paces, then 
came back and kneeled close to 



ORBITSVILLE 



161 



him. “I’m sorry, Vance.” 

“You haven’t done anything to 
apologize for.” 

“I think I have. You see, we’ve 
pretty well solved the problem. 
Dennis O’Hagan didn’t want to say 
anything to you till he’d made a 
check on the math.” 

Garamond’s attention was fully 
captured. “How did you crack it?” 
“Mike Moncaster, our particles 
man, came up with the idea. You 
know about delta particles?” 

“I’ve heard of delta rays.” 

“No — that’s just historic stuff. 
Delta particles — deltons — are a 
component of cosmic rays discover- 
ed only a few years ago. During his 
last leave Mike got himself second- 
ed to the team investigating cosmic 
ray refraction by the force field that 
seals Beachhead City aperture. 
They were glad to have him because 
he’s pretty good on the Conserva- 
tion of Strangeness and ...” 
“Denise! You started to tell me 
how you were going to get a bear- 
ing.” 

“That’s what I’m doing. Deltons 
don’t interact much. That’s why it 
took so long to find them — and 
that’s why they can travel ten or fif- 
teen million kilometers through air. 
Mike is fairly certain they can pene- 
trate the force lens, just like other 
components of cosmic rays, so 
we’re going to build a big delton de- 
tector. Two of them, in fact. One 
behind the other to give us coordi- 
nates. All we need then is to pick 
up a delton, just one, and going 



back the way it came will give us a 
straight line home.” 

"Do you think it will work?” 

“I think so.” Denise’s voice was 
kind. “What we still have to deter- 
mine is how long we're likely to wait 
before a particle comes this way. It 
could be quite a while if things 
aren’t in our favor. But we can 
swing the odds by making the de- 
tectors as big as possible or by 
erecting a whole bank of them.” 
Garamond felt the distance be- 
tween himself and Elizabeth Lind- 
strom shrink a little, and the sick 
joy of vengeance spurted within 
him. “Great news!” 

“I know,” Denise said. “My 
dowry.” 

“You’ll have to explain that 
one." 

"The first time you ever noticed 
me aboard ship was when I gave the 
news you wanted to hear about 
getting through the aperture.” She 
laughed ruefully. “Being a prag- 
matist, I must have decided that if 
it worked once it would work 
again.” 

Garamond moved his hand un- 
certainly and touched her cheek. 
“Denise, I . .” 

“Let’s not play games, Vance." 
She pushed away his hand and 
stood up. “I was childish, that’s 
all.” 

Later, while waiting for sleep to 
relieve him of the burden of iden- 
tity, Garamond was acutely 
aware — for the first time in 
months — that the hard, angry 



162 



GALAXY 



vacuum of space began only a short 
distance beneath his cot. The feel- 
ing persisted into surrealistic 
dreams poising him dangerously on 
the rim of a precipace, with a kind 
of moral vertigo drawing him over 
the edge. 

XV 

O n his way to the airstrip Gara- 
mond was surprised to notice 
one of his crewmen wearing what 
could only be described as a coolie 
hat. He eyed the young man curi- 
ously, received a half-hearted sa- 
lute, and decided the unusual head- 
gear must be a personal souvenir of 
a tourist trip to the Orient. A 
minute later, while passing the 
workshop area, he saw two more 
men wearing similar hats, which he 
then realized were woven from 
fresh silver-green straw. The an- 
cient peasant-styling, with all that 
it symbolized in Earth’s history, 
was repugnant to Garamond. He 
hoped it would not become a full- 
blown fad such as occasionally 
swept through the crew levels. 
When he reached the test site, the 
glinting of flat green triangles in 
the distance told him that coolie 
hats were being worn by at least 
half the men clearing grass at the 
far end of the airstrip. 

Cliff Napier was waiting for him 
at the door to the operations shed, 
his shoulder-heavy bulk filling the 
entrance. "Morning, Vance. We’re 
nearly ready to fly.” 



“Good.” Garamond eyed the 
first aircraft appraisingly then 
turned his gaze back along the 
strip. "It looks like a paddy field 
dow n there. Why are the men wear- 
ing those sunhats?” 

“Would you believe,” Napier 
said impassively, “to protect them 
from the sun?” 

Garamond ignored the sarcasm. 
“But why that sort of hat?” 

“I guess because they’re light 
and easy to make. That’s a good 
shape if the sun’s directly above you 
and you’re working in the dirt all 
day.” 

"1 still don’t like them.” 
“You’re not working in the dirt 
all day.” This time there was no 
mistaking the coldness in the big 
man’s manner. 

Garamond locked eyes with 
Napier and was shaken to feel a 
surge of anger and dislike. This 
can't be, he thought. Aloud he 
said, "Do you expect me to? Do 
you think I’m not making the most 
efficient use of human resources?” 
“From your point of view, you 
are.” 

“And from their point of view?” 
“The cold season’s coming down 
soon. Most of the crew are staying 
here, remember. They’d rather be 
building houses and processing 
grass into protein cakes.” 
Garamond decided against an- 
swering immediately lest he damage 
a working relationship. He glanced 
up at the sky and saw that behind 
the shield of brilliance the broadest 



ORBITSVILLE 



163 



ribs of light-blue were well in the 
ascendant in the west. They signi- 
fied that summer was approaching 
the diametrically opposite point on 
Orbitsville’s shell, that fall was end- 
ing on the near side. 

“This Orbitsville syndrome of 
yours," he said after a pause. “An 
early symptom is that a man devel- 
ops an aversion to taking orders, 
right?" 

“That seems to come into it.” 

“Then let’s sit down together and 
agree on a common set of goals. 
That way . .” 

“That way we’d do everything 
you want and you wouldn’t even 
have to give the orders,” Napier 
said sharply, but this time he was 
smiling. 

Garamond smiled in return. 
“Why do you think I suggested it?” 
Although the crisis had passed, he 
had a feeling it carried significance 
for the future and he was deter- 
mined to take appropriate action. 
"We’ll open a bottle tonight and 
get our ideas straightened out.” 

“I thought we were out of 
whiskey.” 

“No. There’s plenty.” 

“You’re on that stuff Burton 
makes?” 

“Why not?” 

An incongruous primness ap- 
peared briefly on Napier’s dark fea- 
tures. "Maybe we can fix some- 
thing up later. How about looking 
at this airplane?” 

“Certainly.” They walked out to- 
ward the waiting machine. It was 



the biscuit color of unpainted plas- 
tic. A high-wing monoplane, it sat 
nose-high on its skids and looking 
like something from a museum of 
aeronautics, but Garamond had no 
doubts about its capabilities. The 
ungainly ship would carry a crew of 
five at a maximum cruising speed 
of five hundred kilometers an hour 
for fifty days at a stretch, landing 
after that time to replenish food 
and water. Even this limitation was 
forced on it by the fact that more 
than two-thirds of the payload 
would be taken up by spares, an 
iron cow and other supplies. 

Garamond glanced from the 
newly completed machine to the 
others of its kind farther back in 
the open-air production line, and 
from them up to the black rectan- 
gular screen of the delton detector 
on the hillside. He felt a vague 
spasm of alarm over the extent to 
which his future was dependent on 
complex artifacts, but this was ob- 
literated by the yearning hunger 
that kept him alive, that was the 
motive force behind all his actions. 
It was ironic, he thought, that in 
depriving him of all worth living for 
in his previous life, Elizabeth Lind- 
strom had provided, in herself, the 
single goal of his new existence. She 
had also given him a means of es- 
caping from it, for he could foresee 
no w ay of long surviving the act of 
pulling the President’s ribcage 
apart with his bare hands and 
gripping the heaving redness within 
and . 



164 



GALAXY 



“I know what you’re thinking, 
Vance.” 

“Do you?” Garamond stared 
into the face of the stranger who 
had spoken to him. He made the ef- 
fort which allowed him to associate 
that face with Cliff Napier. There 
was a psychic wrench, and once 
again he was back in the sane 
world, walking toward the aircraft 
with his senior officer. 

“Well, don’t keep me in sus- 
pense, Commander,” he heard 
himself saying. 

"I think you’re secretly pleased 
the electronics lab isn’t able to 
build autopilots. If we’re going to 
fly that distance, we want to fly it 
our own selves. We want to be able 
to tell people we did it with our 
hands.” 

Garamond nodded. With our 
hands, he thought. One of the 
group standing at the plane was 
wearing a coolie hat. When its 
owner turned to greet him, Gara- 
mond was startled to see the sweat- 
beaded features of Try Litman, the 
senior production executive. Lit- 
man was a short pudgy man who 
had always compensated for the 
natural untidiness of his physique 
by paying strict attention to his uni- 
form and off-duty dress. He was 
one of the last Garamond would 
have expected to favor a badly 
woven grass hat. Garamond began 
to doubt his earlier conviction that 
the design of the grass headgear 
was symbolic rather than utili- 
tarian. 



“The ship looks good,” Gara- 
mond said. “Is she ready to fly?” 

“As near as she’ll ever be,” Lit- 
man replied. 

Like the hat, the answer was not 
what Garamond would have ex- 
pected of Litman. “How near is 
that?” 

“Relax, Vance.” Litman grinned 
within the column of shadow pro- 
jected by the brim of his hat. “That 
ship will take you as far as you want 
to go.” 

“I’m ready to take her up now, 
sir,” Braunek said opportunely, 
from the opposite side of the group. 

“You’re happy enough about 
it?” 

“If the computer’s happy, I’m 
happy, sir. Anyway, I did a few fast 
taxis yesterday and she felt fine.” 

“Go ahead, then.” Garamond 
watched the young man climb into 
the plane’s glasshouse and strap 
himself into his seat. A few seconds 
later the propellers started to turn, 
silently driven by the magnetic 
resonance engines, and the control 
surfaces flicked in anticipation. As 
the propeller revolutions built up 
the group moved out of the back- 
wash and a similar scattering took 
place among the work gangs at the 
far end of the runway. The plane 
began to move and excited shouts 
went up, signifying that despite the 
computer predictions and tape- 
controlled machines, there had re- 
mained some areas of human par- 
ticipation. 

In its unloaded condition the air- 



ORBITSV1LLE 



165 



craft used very little of the runway 
before lifting cleanly into the air. It 
continued in a straight line for 
about a kilometer, rising steadily, 
its shadow flitting over the grass 
directly below, then banked into a 
lazy turn and circled the encamp- 
ment. The soundless flight seemed 
effortless, like that of a gull riding 
on a fresh breeze, but on the third 
pass Garamond thought he saw a 
small object detach itself from the 
aircraft and go fluttering to the 
ground. 

“What was that?” Napier called, 
screening his eyes. “I saw some- 
thing fall.” 

“Nothing fell,” Litman asserted 
quickly. 

"I saw something, too," Gara- 
mond said. “You’d better get a 
medic on the truck, just in case.” 
“It wouldn’t do any good — we 
had to pull the transmission out.” 
“What?” Garamond stared in 
disbelief at Litman’s uneasy but de- 
fiant face. “One of the first proce- 
dures we agreed on was that the 
truck would be kept at readiness 
during flight testing.” 

“I guess I forgot.” 

Garamond flicked a hand up- 
ward, sending Litman’s hat tum- 
bling behind him. “You are not a 
peasant,” he said harshly. “You 
are not a coolie. You are a Star- 
flight executive officer and I’m 
going to see that you . .” 

“Braunek’s coming back,” 
someone yelled, and Garamond re- 
turned his attention to the aircraft. 



The pilot had not tried, or had been 
unable, to line up on the runway. 
He was coming in parallel to it, his 
ship rising and sinking noticeably 
as it breasted the wind. Garamond 
estimated the touchdown point and 
relaxed slightly as he saw it would 
be well to the north of the buildings 
and tents clustered around the hulk 
of the Bissendorf. The plane con- 
tinued its descent, side-slipping a 
little but holding fairly well to its 
course. 

“I told you there was nothing to 
worry about," Litman said in a re- 
proachful voice. 

“You’d better be right.” Gara- 
mond kept his eyes on Braunek’s 
ship. The side-slipping was more 
noticeable now, but each skid 
brought the plane a little closer to 
the centerline of the cleared strip 
and Garamond hoped that Braunek 
was good enough at his trade to be 
doing it on purpose. He knew, how- 
ever, that there had to come a mo- 
ment, a precise moment, in every 
air crash when the spectator on the 
ground was forced to accept that 
the pilot had lost his struggle 
against the laws of aerial physics, 
that a disaster had to occur. For 
Garamond, the moment came when 
he saw that the starboard propeller 
was ceasing to spin. The plane 
pulled to the right, as though the 
wing on that side had hit an in- 
visible pylon, and staggered down 
the perilous sky toward the hillside. 
Toward, Garamond suddenly rea- 
lized, the black rectangle of the 



166 



GALAXY 



delton detector. He was unable to 
breathe during the final few seconds 
of flight as the doomed ship, see- 
sawing its wings, became silhou- 
etted against land instead of sky 
and then flailed its way through the 
delton screen. And it was not until 
the sound of the crash reached him 
that he was freed from his stasis 
and began to run. 

B raunek’s life was saved by the 
fact that the lightweight frames 
of the detector screens served as ef- 
ficient absorbers of kinetic energy. 
They had accepted the impact, 
folding almost gently around the 
ship, stretching and twisting, and 
then trailing out behind it like 
vines. By the time Garamond 
reached the crash site, Braunek 
had been helped out of the wreck- 
age and was sitting on the grass. He 
was surrounded by technicians who 
had been working in the small hut 
linked to the screens. One of them 
was spraying tissue sealant over a 
gash on his leg. 

“I’m glad you made it,” Gara- 
mond said, feeling inadequate. 
“Are you all right?” 

Braunek shook his head. “I’m all 
right, yes, but everything else is 
screwed up.” He tried to raise him- 
self from the ground. 

Garamond pushed him back. 
“Don’t move. I want the medics to 
have a proper look at you. What 
happened, anyway?" 

“Starboard-wing center panel 
dropped off.” 



“It just — dropped off?" he asked 
incredulously. 

Braunek nodded. “It took the 
engine control runs with it, other- 
wise I could have brought the ship 
in okay.” 

Garamond jumped to his feet. 
“Litman! Find that panel and 
bring it here. Fast!” 

Litman. who was just arriving on 
the scene, looked exasperated but 
he turned without a word and ran 
back down the hillside. Garamond 
stayed on talking with Braunek un- 
til a medic arrived to check him 
over, then surveyed the ruins of the 
delton screen. Somewhere in the 
middle of the wreckage a damaged 
aircraft engine was still releasing 
gyromagnetic impulses that sent 
harmless flickers of detuned energy 
racing over the metalwork like St. 
Elmo’s fire. Where accidental reso- 
nances occurred a feeble motive 
force was conjured up and the 
broken struts of the framework 
twitched like the legs of a dying in- 
sect. The destruction looked final 
to Garamond but he checked with 
O’Hagan and confirmed that the 
screen had been rendered useless 
except as a source of raw materials. 

“How long till you have another 
one operational?" 

“A week, perhaps,” O'Hagan 
said. “We’ll go for modular con- 
struction this time. That means we 
could have small areas operational 
in a couple of days, and we could 
build up to a useful size before your 
airplanes are ready to take off.” 



ORBITSVILLE

“Do that.” Garamond left his 
Chief Science Officer staring 
gloomily into the wreckage and 
went down the hillside to meet the 
group that had retrieved the lost 
wing section. The men set down the 
plastic panel in front of him and 
stood back without speaking. Gara- 
mond ran his gaze over it and saw 
at once that two longtitudinal edges 
that should have been ridged with 
welding overlays were square and 
clean except for small positioning 
welds which had broken. 

Garamond turned to face Lit- 
man. “All right — who was respon- 
sible for the welding of this panel, 
and who was supposed to inspect?” 
“It’s hard to say,” Litman re- 
plied. 

“Hard to say?” 

Litman gulped, nodded. 

“Then check it out on the work 
cards.” Garamond spoke with in- 
sulting gentleness. 

“What work cards?" Suddenly 
tired of being pushed, Litman 
turned a red, resentful face up to 
Garamond’s. ‘‘Where have you 
been. Mister Garamond? Did no- 
body tell you we've got only bits of 
workshop left? Did nobody tell you 
that winter’s coming and we just 
can’t afford all the time and 
material that’s going into these fly- 
ing toys of yours?” 

“That isn’t in your area of com- 
petence.” 

“Of course not!” The redness 
had spread into Litman’s eyes as he 
glanced around the gathering 



crowd. ‘‘I’m only a production 
man. I'm just one of the slobs who 
has to meet your airy-fairy target 
dates with no bloody equipment. 
But there’s something you seem to 
forget, Mister Garamond. Out here 
a man who knows how to use his 
hands is worth twenty Starflight 
commanders with nothing left to 
command.” Litman clenched his 
fists. “What will you do if we de- 
cide not to finish your planes?” 

A low, interested murmur arose 
from the men behind Litman. 

Cliff Napier stepped into the 
arena. “For a so-called production 
man,” he said, “you seem to do a 
lot of work with your mouth, Lit- 
man. 1 suggest that you . .” 

“It’s all right,” Garamond cut 
in, placing a restraining hand on 
Napier’s arm. He raised his voice so 
that he could be heard by every- 
body in the vicinity. “I know how 
most of you feel about settling 
down here and making the best of 
things. And I know you want to get 
on with survival work before the 
weather turns. Furthermore, I can 
sympathize with your point of view 
about obsolescent Starflight com- ■ 
manders. But let me assure you of 
one thing. I’m leaving here with a 
fleet of airplanes, and the airplanes 
are going to be built properly, to 
the very highest standards of which 
we are capable. If I find they don’t 
work as well as they ought to I’ll 
simply turn them around and fly 
them right back to you.” 

Garamond paused for emphasis. 



168 



GALAXY 



“So the only way you’ll get me 
out of your hair permanently is by 
building good airplanes. And don’t 
come sniffling to me about target 
dates or shortage of equipment. 
Don’t forget — I’ve seen how you 
can work when you want to. What 
sort of a target date did we have 
when we were getting ready to 
punch a hole right through the 
middle of Beachhead City?” Gara- 
mond stopped and outstared the 
man nearest him. 

“A nice finishing touch,” Napier 
whispered. “If they still have 
pride.” 

“Ah, hell,” somebody growled 
from several rows back. "We might 
as well finish the job, now we’ve 
done most of the work.” There was 
a general rumble of assent and the 
crowd, after a moment’s hesitation, 
began to disperse. The response 
was not as wholehearted as Gara- 
mond could have wished, but he 
felt relieved at having maintained 
any kind of authority over Litman. 
The production executive, his face 
expressionless, was turning away 
with the others. 

“Troy,” Garamond said to him, 
“we could have talked that one out 
in private.” 

Litman shrugged. “I’m satisfied 
with the way things went.” 

“Are you? You used to be known 
as the best production controller in 
the S.E.A. fleet.” 

“That’s all in the past, Vance. 
I’ve got bigger things on my mind 
now.” 



“Bigger than a man’s life? Brau- 
nek could have been killed by that 
sloppy workmanship.” 

“I’m sorry about young Brau- 
nek’s getting hurt, and I’m glad it 
isn’t serious.” Litman looked Gara- 
mond square in the eye. “The rea- 
son the men went along with you a 
moment ago is that you gave them 
Orbitsville — and that’s important 
to them. They’re going to spread 
out through Orbitsville, Vance. 
This camp won’t hold together 
more than a year or two, and then 
most likely it will be left empty.” 

‘‘We were talking about the 
plane crash.” 

‘‘We tlon’t stand united any 
more. Any man who trusts his life 
to a machine he hasn’t personally 
checked out is a fool. You should 
remember that.” Litman plodded 
off down the hillside, probably in- 
tent on retrieving his coolie hat. 
Garamond stared after the compact 
figure, filled with the uneasy dislike 
that a man feels for another who 
seems in closer touch with the 
realities of a situation. He thought 
hard about Litman’s words during 
the midday meal. He decided to 
turn himself into a one-man inspec- 
tion and quality assurance team, 
with entire responsibility for the 
airworthiness of his aircraft. 

The self-imposed task, with its 
round of visual and manual check- 
ing of every aspect of the fleet pro- 
duction, occupied most of Gara- 
mond’s working hours. It brought 
the discovery that he still had the 



ORBITSVILLE 



169 



ability to sleep without stunning his 
system with alcohol. 

G aramond was spreadeagled 
across the tailplane of the 
seventh aircraft, examining the 
elevator hinges, when he felt a tap 
on his shoulder. It was late in the 
day and therefore hot. Tempera- 
tures on Orbitsville built up steadily 
throughout each daylight period 
before dropping abruptly at night- 
fall. He had been hoping to finish 
that particular job without inter- 
ruption. He kept his head inside 
the resinous darkness of the inspec- 
tion hatch, hoping the interloper 
would take the hint and go away, 
but there came another and more 
insistent tap. Garamond twisted 
into a sitting position and found 
himself looking into the creased dry 
face of O’Hagan. The scientist had 
never been a happy-looking man, 
but on this occasion his expression 
was even more bleak than usual. 
Garamond felt a stab of concern. 

He switched off his inspection 
light and slid to the ground. “Has 
anything happened, Dennis?” 
O’Hagan gave a reluctant nod. 
“We’ve recorded a delta particle.” 
“You’ve recorded a . Gara- 
mond pressed the back of his hand 
to his forehead and fought to con- 
trol his elation. “Isn’t that what 
we’ve been trying to do? What's 
your worry?” 

“We’ve got only about eighty 
percent of the original screen re- 
built.” 



“So?” 

“It’s too soon, Vance. I’ve been 
through Mike Moncaster’s math a 
couple of times and I can’t fault 
him. With two complete screens — 
which is what we planned for — to 
give a receiving area of five hun- 
dred square meters, we would have 
had to wait eighty or ninety days 
even to . 

“We were lucky,” Garamond in- 
terrupted, laughing, astonished 
that he still remembered how. “It 
just shows that the laws of proba- 
bility are bound to give you a break 
eventually. Come on, Dennis, ad- 
mit it.” 

O'Hagan shook his head with 
somber conviction. “The laws of 
probability aren’t bound to give 
anyone anything, my friend.” 

The eight aircraft took off at first 
light while the air was cool and 
thick. They climbed steadily against 
the seriate blue archways of the 
Orbitsville sky. At the agreed cruis- 
ing height of five hundred meters 
the ungainly, stiff-winged birds 
leveled off, exchanging brief com- 
munications through pulses of 
modulated light. They assumed a 
V-formation and circled the base 
camp once, their shadows falling 
on the remains of the Bissendorf, 
the metallic egg that had given 
them birth. Without lingering fur- 
ther, they set course toward the 
prismatic mists to the east.

Dear Editor: 

I was pleasantly surprised when I 
finally opened your latest issue — 
the April — and saw Jerry Pournelle 
had done a science article for 
Gulaxv. This is sf magazine science 
fact really moving up in the world. 
Of all the people 1 have met in my 
life. Jerry is one of the most colos- 
sally educated in science. He had 
advanced training in systems engi- 
neering. psychology, physics, math- 
ematics, logic, and political science. 
He is the only science degree person 
I have ever known who was able to 
explain coherently the entire Veli- 
kovsky controversy, an hour later 
do the same for the Atlantean 
legend, and then, in a major talk, 
describe the new. dynamic, holo- 
graphic view of the structure of the 
brain. Jerry has Isaac Asimov’s 
memory in a younger body, and it 
comes out by instant association in 
a similar electrifying voice. Several 
sentences in his article referred to 
new developments in aerospace and 
energy science that were hitherto 



unknown to me — and 1 tty to keep 
up. After reading that, the future 
already looks brighter to me. Scien- 
tifically oriented readers will now 
have to add Galaxy to their list of 
publications they need to keep up 
with what’s going on. 

Sincerely, 

A. E. van Vogt 

It is immensely gratifying to all con- 
cerned to receive such praise from 
one of vour stature. O f course the 
obvious next step would be an A. E. 
van Vogt story based on an idea [ or 
ideas \ from a Pournelle column ! I 
wonder if it could be arranged for 
both to appear in the same issue . 

— Baen 

Bv all rights this letter should have 
appeared in June Galaxy along with 
the Panshins' Forum article which 
it accompanied. However, as is well 
known to writers, editors are some- 
times blind, and it just didn 7 occur 
to me until too lute. So. belatedly, a 
letter from Alexei Panshin. 

Dear Jim, 

As the enclosed column suggests, 
it is time for new things in science 
fiction — new writers, new kinds of 
stories. Science fiction is about to 
enter a flourishing new period. 

What is needed, you and 1 seem 
to be agreed, is a magazine ap- 
propriate to contain and present 
this new science fiction, a magazine 
that will communicate the fact that 
something new is present by its very 
appearance, a magazine that will 



171 



approach the reader by displaying 
sf s best qualities. These best quali- 
ties are strong story values, heroes, 
vigor, and a sense of the meaning of 
our times. Science fiction at its 
most robust is something that a 
wide audience is ready to welcome. 

The present science fiction maga- 
zines represent sf in a half-assed 
way. They are small in size. They 
present a negative appearance. 
They look like yesterday. They have 
small circulations (small, including 
even Analog's 100,000 plus). They 
are easily overlooked. My students 
at Cornell told me that they didn’t 
read the magazines on the assump- 
tion that anything good in them 
would appear in the pb anthologies 
that they did buy. 

This is a false assumption. Not 
every good thing from the maga- 
zines converts to paperback. In 
particular: personality, a sense of 
continuity, responsiveness. Com- 
pared to magazines, pbs have a 
cold and isolated atmosphere. 
Magazines are communities. Maga- 
zines give direction to their com- 
munities. 

Moreover, pb anthologies are as 
spotty in their selections as the pre- 
sent magazines. Many anthologies 
contain nothing but original stories 
that have not been published in the 
magazines. These are generally all 
written around some common gim- 
mick or assumption, and they are 
no better and often worse than the 
average product of the present 
magazines. 



Vertex is probably a response to 
the same sense that there is need 
for an sf magazine of a new kind. 
But Vertex — thin, glossy, mechani- 
cal in tone, saddle-stapled — is not 
the right response. As a sister pub- 
lication to skin books, and being 
like them in some essential regards, 
it separates itself from the conclave 
of digest-size sf and mystery maga- 
zines, and loses itself in rows of 
skin magazines. Its 8'/j by 10% 
size causes it to be lost among other 
dissimilar magazines of that same 
common size. What may keep 
Vertex alive is its price — $1.50 
versus .75c for the digest maga- 
zines. For less actual value. For 
better physical package and more 
concern with graphics. 

This may demonstrate two 
things. Sf in a new package can sell 
for a higher price than the present 
magazines charge. And this is a 
time in which even misguided ex- 
periments have a chance of success. ; 
If Vertex , which in its attempt to be 
dignified barely identifies itself as 
science fiction, can succeed simply 
because it presents sf in a novel 
manner, then a new magazine in a 
new format with a better sense of 
the times and of the values of 
science fiction should sell strongly. 

The solution is a magazine with 
the size and shape of the pulp 
magazines. In fact, it should be the 
pulp magazine raised to a new 
level. The pulp magazine gone First 
Class. It should be 3/4 of an inch 
thick, as thick as a paperback. It 



172 



GALAXY 



should be 7 inches wide and per- 
haps 9 inches tall. If placed among 
the digest magazines, it will domi- 
nate. If placed among taller maga- 
zines, it will elbow its way to the 
front. 

This size speaks of an earlier day 
when science fiction was more 
forthright and vigorous, more 
rowdy and adventurous than it has 
been in recent years. The covers 
should reinforce this impression. 
They should be strongly colorful, 
active and positive. The cover print- 
ing should be bold. 

The price for this magazine 
should be high: $1.50, $2.00, or 
possibly more. 

In return, the magazine should 
present a generous appearance. 
Cover stock should be plasticized. 
This would permit the bold neo- 
pulp art style to become electric. It 
also suggests extra value. It is this 
generous, extravagant, bonus value 
that must be the spirit of the maga- 
zine. It must be generously illus- 
trated. It must offer an ample 
bounty of fiction — 125,000 words, 
perhaps. It must offer a healthy 
editorial side — perhaps 25,000 

words of editorial, articles and re- 
views. The reviews should be of the 
books, records, movies, comic 
books, performers, comedians that 
show a sense of the new times. This 
new science fiction magazine 
should be the heartland not of 
science fiction merely but of the 
new times. It should present the 
emerging myth of the day. It should 



speak to all those who believe in 
ecology, evolution and synergy. All 
those who believe in self-transfor- 
mation. In its very appearance, the 
magazine should speak of these 
things. Of new powers. Of new atti- 
tudes and new ways. 

In its price and its appearance, 
and in its sense of itself, the new 
magazine separates itself from the 
cheap digest science fiction maga- 
zines. The title should not speak of 
them, either. It should be a new 
title altogether, free to become a 
new frame of mind. It should sound 
positive, science fictional, and of 
the times. 

Vertexes and analogs are me- 
chanical. Galaxy is physical. If is 
hypothetical. The magazine of fan- 
tasy and science fiction is initialese. 
Amazing and fantastic are more 
emotional, but the words of another 
time. 

Quest is a possibility. No — Quest 
is not a possibility. 

I’ve got Dimension and New 
Realities and Bonzo SF written 
down here. And Overplus, which 
Cory hated immediately. I like 
Bonzo SF best, but that’s not it. 

The title, whatever it is, should 
say liberation, expansion, unfold- 
ing, maturation, growth, evolution, 
ecology, creativity, synergy, multi- 
plexity, multiformity, changing 
headstates, innerness, alternate re- 
alities. 

The magazine should pay its con- 
tributors well. If original antholo- 
gies can have budgets for stories of 



DIRECTIONS 



173 



51 5.000 for 300,000 words and sell 
enough copies in hardcover and 
Soft to justify this, then there is an 
audience for a quality magazine 
that can pay 4-6e a word. And pay 
well for good illustration and cover 
art. 

Your suggestion of a quarterly 
makes good sense. A first issue 
could be tried as an experiment. A 
quarterly would be unable to run 
serial novels. But with the amount 
of wordage 1 am suggesting, it 
would be possible to run a complete 
novel of 60,000 words, a short novel 
of 25,000 words, two novelettes of 

15.000 words, and two or three 
short stories. That would seem a 
substantial value to attract an 
audience with. 

These days there is always an 
availability of novels. The strongest 
expressions of the new thing in sf 
and in society will be at novel 
length. Offer a complete novel and 
a number of long stories in a pack- 
age of the first quality, with the 
spirit of the old all-story maga- 
zines, and charge well. 

It takes a strong editorial vision. 
A refusal to compromise. But the 
result will have an immediate im- 
pact. It will be a center of attrac- 
tion for writers and readers with a 
similar sense of the times. 

Cory and l want a magazine of 
this sort. We would like to read it 
and we would like to contribute to 
it. We are willing to do whatever is 
necessary to see a first issue into be- 
ing. 



We are willing to contribute a 
critical article and reviews. If novels 
are to be the strength on which the 
magazine and its new vision are to 
be hung, we are willing to write a 
novel for the first issue. We are 
willing to scout, to knock on doors, 
to ask specific people for contribu- 
tions, to make story assignments or 
whatever to get appropriate stories 
for a first issue. 

If you are serious about putting 
together a science fiction magazine 
that is as strong as a science fiction 
magazine could be, you may count 
on us. 

Yours, 

Alexei
