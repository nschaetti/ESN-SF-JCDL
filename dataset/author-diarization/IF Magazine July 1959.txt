Why would anyone want to kill a tender of mechanized 



vegetation — with, of all things, a watch and a little red bird? 



4 







By F. L. WALLACE 



T he furry little animal 

edged cautiously toward 
him, ready to scamper up a 
tree. But the kernel on the 
ground was tempting and the 
animal grabbed it and scur- 
ried back to safety. Richel Al- 
sint sat motionless, enjoying 
himself greatly. 

Outside the park in every 



direction were many tiers of 
traffic. He was the only per- 
son in the park; it was silent 
there except for birds. One in 
particular he noticed, ail body, 
or entirely wing — it was im- 
possible to say v/hich at this 
distance — soared effortlessly 
overhead, a small bundle of 
bright blue feathers. The 














wings, if it had wings, didn’t 
move at all ; the bird balanced 
with remarkable skill on air 
currents. Everything about it 
might be small, but the voice 
wasn’t, and it made good use 
of every note. 

Alsint twisted his hand 
slowly toward the sack beside 
him. 

In that position the ship 
watch was visible. There was 
no need to look; it was con- 
nected to the propulsion proc- 
esses of the ship and would 
signal long before he had to 
be back. Nevertheless he did 

glance at it. 

In sudden alarm, he jumped 
up, scattering the contents of 
the sack. The circle of animals 
fled into the underbrush and 
the birds stopped singing and 
flew away. 

He left everything on the 
bench. It was untidy, but his 
life would be more untidy if 
he missed the ship. He ran to 
the aircar parked in the clear- 
ing and fumbled at the door. 
The bright blue bird was 
changing to red, but he didn’t 
notice that. 

He bounced the car straight 
up, sinking into the cushions 
with the acceleration. High 
above the regular levels of 
traffic, he located the space- 
port in the distance and jam- 
med the throttle forward. The 
ship was there, and as long as 
it was, he had a chance. Not 
much, though. The absence of 
activity on the ground indi- 
cated they were getting ready. 



H e dropped the aircar 

down as close as he could 
get and left it. There was no 
time to take the underground 
passage that came up some- 
where near the ship. The 
guard at the surface gate stop- 
ped him. 

“You’re too late,” said the 
attendant. 

“I’ve got to get in!” Alsint 

said. 

The guard recognized the 
uniform, but, sitting in the 
heavily reinforced cubicle, 
made no move to press the 
button which would allow the 
gate to swing open. It was a 
high gate and there was no 
way to get over it. 

He grinned sourly. “Next 
time you’ll pay attention to the 
signal.” 

There were worse times and 
places to argue about it, but 
Alsint couldn’t remember 
them. “There wasn’t any sig- 
nal,” he said. He caught th^e 
cynical expression on the 
guard’s face and extended his 
hand. “See for yourself.” 

The watch was working, in- 
dicating time till takeoff, but 
the unmistakable glow and the 
irritating tingle, guaranteed 
to wake any man out of a sleep 
this side of the final one, were 
missing. 

The guard blinked. “Never 
heard of that ever happen- 
ing,” he said. “Tell you what 
— I’ll testify that it wasn’t 
your fault. That’ll clear you. 
You can get a job on the next 
ship and catch up with your 



F. L. WALLACE

own in a month at the most.” 
It wasn’t that easy, nor so 
simple. Alsint glanced fran- 
tically at the watch. Minutes 
left now, though he couldn’t 
be sure. If the signal wasn't 
functioning, maybe the time 
was wrong too. “I’ll never get 
on that one again,” he said. 
“It’s a tag ship.” 

The guard scrutinized him 
more closely, differentiating 
his uniform from others sim- 
ilar to it. “In that case you’d 
better go to the traffic tower,” 
he said reluctantly. “They’ll 
stop it for you.” 

They would, but he’d waste 
half an hour getting past the 
red tape at the entrance. 
TTiere were a number of rea- 
sons why he couldn’t let the 
ship leave without him. “I 
know our crew,” he said. 
“They’ll be waiting for me. 
Let me try to get on.” 

The guard shrugged. “It’s 
your funeral.” Slowly the 
gate swung open. 

Alsint dashed through. He 
had to hurry, but it wasn’t as 
dangerous as the guard im- 
agined. The watch had failed, 
but inside the ship was a panel 
which indicated the presence 
or absence of any crew mem- 
ber. That panel was near the 
pilot. He w'ouldn’t take off 
without clearing it. 

Besides, there was standard 
takeoff procedure — always 
someone at the visionport, 
watching for latecomers, of 
which there were usually a 
few. Alsint raised his head as 

GROWING SEASON 



he ran. He couldn’t see any- 
one at the visionport. 

Breathing heavily, he 
brushed against the ship. Late, 
but not too late. He turned the 
corner at the vane. 

He didn’t like what he saw. 
The ramp was up and the 
outer lock was closed. They 
were waiting for clearance 
from the spaceport. 

His composure slipped a lit- 
tle. If the clearance came 
within the next few minutes, 
he’d be dead. Not that the 
clearance would come. A ship 
just didn’t lift off, leaving one 
of the crew behind — or he 
hoped it didn’t. 

He pounded on the lock and 
shouted, though it was useless. 
Inside, they couldn’t hear him. 
The noise frightened a little 
red bird which had been hov- 
ering nearby. It flew around 
his head, squawking shrilly. 

A lsint scowled at it. it re- 
minded him unpleasantly 
of the park. If he hadn’t gone 
there, he’d be safe inside the 
ship. True, parks were rare, 
and people who went to them 
even more rare. After so many 
months in the ship, it had been 
a great temptation — for him, 
not the others. No one else 
had been interested. 

Now he had to get in. A 
tremor ran through the hull 
and he realized how urgent it 
was. A little more of this and 
he would be caught under the 
rockets. 

The airlock was smooth, but 

7 



he located the approximate 
latching point on the outside 
and stripped off the watch, 
holding it against the ship by 
the band. He tried to remem- 
ber and thought’ the face 
should be turned inward. He 
held it that way and hoped he 
was right. He closed his eyes 
and swung hard with his fist. 

His hand exploded with pain 
and he could feel the flash on 
his face. The energy, which 
was sufficient to drive the in- 
strument for a thousand years, 
dissipated in much less than 
a second. An instant later the 
hand which held the strap re- 
acted to the heat. lie dropped 
the useless watch and opened 
his eyes. 

He had figured it right and 
he was also lucky. The energy 
had turned inward, as he had 
hoped, otherwise he'd have no 
hand, and the latching mech- 
anism had been destroyed. 
The resulting heat had buck- 
led the plate outward. The 
hull was trembling with great- 
er violence as the takeoff rock- 
ets warmed up. 

The airlock was still very 
hot. His fingers sizzled as he 
grasped the curled edge and 
pulled out. It moved a little. 
He shifted his hands for a 
better grip and heaved. It 
opened. 

He scrambled inside and 
shut it behind him, latching 
it with the emergency device. 
Close, but it didn’t matter as 
long as he’d made it. The ship 
began to rise and the acceler- 



ation forced him to kneel in 
the passageway between the 
outer and inner lock. He kept 
thinking of the little red bird 
he’d seen outside. Burned, no 
doubt, as he would have been. 

Finally the rockets stopped 
and the heaviness disappear- 
ed. They were out of the at- 
mosphere and hence the ship 
had shifted to interstellar 
drive. The heat from the rock- 
ets began to abate. He was 
grateful for that. 

He got to his feet and stag- 
gered to the inner lock and 
leaned against it. That didn’t 
open, either. He shouted. It 
might take time, but eventual- 
ly someone would come close 
enough to hear him. 

There was air in the pass- 
ageway and he knew he could 
survive. It had been too hot; 
now it was getting cold. He 
shivered and shook his head 
in bewilderment. 

None of this was the way it 
ought to be. It had never been 
difficult to get on the ship. If 
he didn’t know better, he’d 
say — 

But this was not the time to 
say that. 

He didn’t hear the footsteps 
on the other side. The lock 
swung in and he fell forward. 
His burned hands were too 
cold to hurt as he checked his 
fall. 

Scantily clad, Larienne stood 
over him. “Playing hiding 
games?” she asked. She got a 
better look and knelt by his 
side. “You’re hurt!”

So he was, but mostly he 
was tired. In the interval be- 
fore he accepted the luxury of 
unconsciousness, the thought 
flashed across his mind before 
he could disowni it: Someone 
on the ship was trying to take 
the plant away, or wanted him 
to fail. 

Either would have been 
accomplished if he had been 
left behind. 

H e sat in his room, think- 
ing. He wished he knew 
more about the crew. Six 
months was enough to give 
him wide acquaintance, but 
not the deep kind. They were 
a clannish lot on the ship. His 
own assistant he knew well 
enough, and the doctor. The 
captain he hardly ever saw. 
The rest of them he knew bv 
sight and name, but not much 
else : the few married couples, 
the legally unattached girls, 
and the larger number of male 
technicians. 

None of them, as far as he 
could see, had any incentive to 
engineer the mixup which had 
nearly caused him to miss the 
ship. Of course he might be 
reading into it more than was 
there. It could have happened 
that way accidentally. And 
then maybe it didn’t. 

His thoughts were inter- 
1‘upted by a knock. “Who’s 
there?” he called. 

Larienne walked in. “No- 
body asks wJio/* she said. “It’s 
always come in. Even I know 
that, and I’ve been on this 



traveling isolation ward a 

mere three years.” 

She dropped into a chair 
and draped her legs, long legs 
that were worth showing off. 
She had a certain air of im- 
partiality that attracted at- 
tention. She was smart, 
though, and knew when to dis- 
card impartiality. 

She eyed him curiously. “I’m 
trying to discover the secret 
of your popularity. That damn 
plant is pining for you.” 

“It’s not me,” he said. “You 
have to know how to handle 
it.” 

“Thanks,” she said dryly. 
“I don’t know how. But Richel 
Alsint, boy plant psychologist, 
does. He knows when to in- 
crease the circulation, when 
to give it an extra shot of min- 
erals, and when, on the other 
hand, to scare the damn thing 
out of its wits, which I some- 
times believe it actually has.” 
“Don’t personalize it,” he 
warned. “It’s partly plant and 
partly a machine. Your mis- 
take is that you treat it as if 
it were wholly a machine.” 
“Seems to me I’ve heard 
that before. What should I do 
that I don’t?” 

“Cycles,” he said. “Rhythm. 
A machine doesn’t need that 
kind of treatment, but a plant 
does. Normally it starts as a 
seed, grows to maturity, pro- 
duces more seeds, and eventu- 
ally dies. Our plant isn’t like 
that, of course. It never pro- 
duces seeds, and, if we’re care- 
ful, doesn’t die. Yet it does

GROWING SEASON 



have something that faintly 
corresponds to the original 
cvcIgs* 

She sighed. “It might help 
if I knew what it was — geran- 
ium, or sunflower, or what- 
ever. ” 

He had told her, but appar- 
ently she didn’t want to re- 
member. “It isn’t one plant. 
It’s been made from hundreds ; 
even I don’t know what they 
were. One best feature from 
this, another strong feature 
from something else. We’ve 
taken plants apart and re- 
combined them into something 
new. This is just — plant.” 

ARIENNE dropped her 
legs to a more comfortable 
if less esthetic position. “Hy- 
droponics was simpler,” she 

rk ill Apf’An 

“It was,” he said. “And if 
you want to know, old-fash- 
ioned dirt farming was even 
simpler. Our combination 
plant and machine is merely 
a step and a half ahead of 
hydroponics.” 

“Suppose you come out and 
tell me what I’ve done wrong,” 
she said, getting up. 

“One last thing,” he said. 
“Remember that plants evolv- 
ed on planets. No matter what 
we do, we can’t convince the 
plant that it’s still on a planet. 
Light’s the easiest. As far as 
we know, it will grow indef- 
initely under our artificial 
light. Artificial gravity is dif- 
ferent. I don’t know the dif- 
ference, and neither do the 

10 



physicists, but the plant does. 
It can live in the ship just so 
long and then has to be taken 
out for a rest. There are other 
things that affect it, vibration, 
noise, and maybe more. You 
know how I have to keep after 
the pilot to dampen his drive. 
All these things change the 
cycle it has to have.” 

“Agreed,” she said impa- 
tiently, meaning mostly that 
she didn’t care. “Let’s go out 
and look at it.” 

The plant was a machine 
and the machine was a plant. 
It occupied a large space in the 
center of the ship. And it was- 
n’t wasted space ; properly 
cared for, the plant could sup- 
ply food for the crew indefin- 
itely. 

The plant machine evolved 
from earlier attempts to con- 
vert raw material and energy 
into food. Originally algae 
were used because they were 
hardy and simple to control. 
But the end product had to be 
processed and algae did not 
produce the full scale of nutri- 
ents in the proper proportion 
for the human diet. 

Certain cells of more highly 
evolved plants were far more 
efficient in the conversion of 
raw materials into proteins, 
vitamins and the like. Origin- 
ally, inedible parts were pro- 
duced too, the stalk, which 
might or mignt not be used 
for food, and the leaves and 
roots. On a planet with plenty 
of room, this made little dif- 
ference. But on an overcrowd- 




f. L WALLACE 



ed planet, or one with a poi- 
sonous atmosphere, and espe- 
cially on a ship where space 
was at a premium, normal 
methods could not be used. 

In the plant machine were 
certain cells which liad been 
selected because of their abil- 
ity to produce a variety of nu- 
trients. The inedible paiis of 
the plant were replaced by 
machinery. Instead of roots 
to draw water and minerals 
from the soil, there were 
pumps and filters. Instead of 
stems to elevate that material 
to the leaves, there were 
hoses. Instead of entire leaves 
to perform photosynthesis, 
there were only those cells 
most efficient at the process. 
There were no seeds, tubers, 
roots, nor fleshy stalks to 
store the food. Collecting trays 
replaced them. There was no 
waste space ; nothing was pro- 
duced that couldn’t be eaten. 

There was an additional 
problem of reconciling the va- 
rious cell fluids and different 
rates of growth. In part, that 
was accomplished by the plant 

machinery; the rest depended 
on the plant mechanic. His job 
was akin to that of a factory 
manager. In a sense, the plant 
machine was nothing more 
than a highly organized and 
complex factory, of which the 
productive units were the ac- 
tual cells. 

A LSINT went along the 
aisles. Dials and gauges 
everywhere — a continuous rec- 



ord was kept of every stage. 
Each record was important, 
but nothing that could be re- 
duced to a formula. The plant 
was not in bad shape, con- 
sidering. At his instructions, 
Larienne made certain adjust- 
ments. 

“Why reduce the light?” she 
asked. “I thought this unit 
grew better with stronger 
light.” 

“It does, within limits.” 

“I was within those limits.” 
“You were, but consider 
this. The plant from which 
these cells came grow fastest 
in early summer, but it isn’t 
edible at that time. In late 
summer, it is. The light 
change merely corresponds to 
original conditions.” 

Partly convinced, she nod- 
ded. “What kind of plant was 

it?” 

He smiled. “I don’t know. 
It’s the nth cellular descend- 
ant of some plant that once 
grew on Earth.” 

She touched a dial she had 
adjusted. “And on this one you 
reduced the fluid flow into it, 
and switched the output to 
another unit I’ve never seen it 
connected to.” 

“Same thing. The input cor- 
responds to the difference be- 
tween the dry and rainy sea- 
sons.” 

“But things grow faster 
with more water.” 

“They do, unless it happens 
to be a cactus.” 

She shook her head. “I give 
up. Cactus yet.” 



GROWING SEASON 



11 



“I didn’t say it was cactus. 
It might be, and, if so, could 
be very efficient in preparing 
water and soil minerals for 
use by the leaves. There aren’t 
any leaves, of course, but that 
doesn’t change the principle.” 

“Don’t think I’ll ever under- 
stand it,” she said. “Enough 
to get by, but not the way you 
do.” 

She stood at his side. It was 
pleasant to have her there. 
Other things were pleasant to 
imagine too, but he refrained. 
There were married couples 
on the ship, just as there were 
unattached men and women. 
But when the men outnumber- 
ed the women three to one, 
certain conclusions were inev- 
itable, and he had made them 
the first few days aboard. Un- 
like many of the others, he 
didn’t expect to stay on the 
ship forever. In a year and a 
half he would either prove his 
point or fail. 

Then he would leave. Would 
Larienne come with him ? May- 
be, but it wasn’t a good bet. A 
liaison, no matter how easy it 
was to enter into, was not al- 
ways easy to break. There 
would be time to decide about 
that later. 

“Is everything all right?” 
she asked. 

He glanced over the dials 
and mentally added them up. 
“Reasonably so. Yes.” 

“Good,” she said. “Unless 
you need me sooner. I’ll be 
back in about ten hours.” 

He nodded and she left. It 



was unnecessary to ask where 
she was going. He could tell 
that from her manner. They 
had raised a hitherto un- 
marked solar system and she 
was helping tag it. 

His injured hands were 
aching with the effort, though 
Larienne had done most of the 
actual work. He started to- 
ward his room, and then, on 
another thought, turned into 
the dispensary. Franklan he 
knew better than anyone ex- 
cept Larienne, and he might 
get a fresh viewpoint from 
him. 

F ranklan was waiting. 

He had a doctor’s degree 
from some planet, but on the 
ship titles were largely ignor- 
ed. “The wounded hero comes 
back, holding our food supply 
precariously in his skilled 
hands,” he said as Alsint en- 
tered. 

The sarcasm was not alto- 
gether friendly, Alsint decid- 
ed. Without comment, he laid 
his hands on the table. He did 
not pretend to be a hero and 
he was not even particularly 
stubborn. He had put together 
a plant in a better way, one 
that ought to withstand the 
rigors of tag ship service, and 
he intended to see that it got 
a fair trial. 

“What do you know about 
ship watches?” he asked cau- 
tiously. 

“Fifteen years on a tag ship, 
and I’ve never personally seen 
a failure. I suppose it can hap-

pen.” Franldan glanced up. 
“It’s too bad you had to de- 
stroy yours to get in. I’d like 
to see what an examination by 
our technicians would show.” 

The same thought that he 
had, though Franklan seemed 
to have attached the opposite 
meaning to it. “Interesting, 
isn’t it?” Alsint said evenly. 
“But I was thinking of the 
connection it has to the crew 
panel.” 

Franklan bit his lip. “I had- 
n’t considered that.” 

“I have. The pilot had to 

check the crew panel before 
he could take off. If he did, 
and saw that I was missing, 
why didn’t he wait? If he 
didn’t see that I wasn’t inside 
the ship, then the panel was 
defective too. It’s hard to be- 
lieve.” 

Franklan filled a small tank 
with fluid and motioned to- 
ward it. Alsint dipped his 
hands in. It stung, but he 
could see that it had a pro- 
nounced healing effect. 

Franklan was watching him 
narrowly. “Service on a tag 
ship is voluntary. It has to be, 
considering all the solitude we 
have to take. Any man can 
withdraw any time he wants. 
A lot of them do, especially in 
the first three years. However, 
bear this in mind. You’ve 
practically accused someone 
on the ship of trying to leave 
you behind. I know you do 
think that. And if you can 
produce evidence. I'll believe 
you. But there is one person 

GROWING SEASON 



on whom suspicion will fall 
first.” 

That was what Alsint want- 
ed to hear. He’d gone over it 
in his mind and couldn't find 
anyone to suspect. Any clue 
was welcome. 

“Who?” he asked. 

“You,” said Franklan. “If 
7 wanted to leave the tag ship 
service, I’d see to it that I 
made as graceful an exit as 
possible. Forced out by an ac- 
cident, of course. I’d want to 
tell people that.” 

H e MIGHT have expected 
that kind of attitude. 
Franklan was proud of the 
work he was associated with. 
Nothing wrong with that; 
everyone had that right. In 
fact, if he didn’t, he had no 
business doing it. 

However, it made things 
difficult for Alsint. He was on 
a tag ship for other reasons. 
He had evolved several strains 
of plant cells that should be 
especially suited for use on 
tag ships.' 

For some reason the plants 
on tag ships were always dy- 
ing. Ships returned to inhab- 
ited planets for refueling 
with the machines intact but 
with the plants dead. The 
plant cells had to be replaced. 
It was not that the actual 
material was expensive. It 
wasn’t. But the process of 
getting the strange cells to 
work together as a new unit 
was time-consuming and 
enormously costly. That was 

13 



where the trouble came. The 
plant couldn’t be fitted togeth- 
er like an engine. 

Alsiiit had evolved cells 
that were far more viable, but 
the only way to test that was 
in actual use. He had received 
permission from the Bureau 
of Exploration to install his 
plant in a ship and try it for 
two years. If at the end of 
that time the plant was still 
alive, he had something real- 
ly worthwhile. The only stipu- 
lation was that no one on the 
ship should know that it was 
a test, since they might, out 
of consideration for him, 
modify the service the ship 
nonnally went through. It 
had to be a true rough, tough 
test. 

And he was getting it, in 
more ways than he had ex- 
pected. Unless he could stay 
with his plant for the next 
year and a half, all his work 
would go for nothing. 

He drew his hands out of 
the fluid. “Do you think I’m 
trying to run out?” he asked 
quietly. He had proof that he 
wasn’t, but he couldn’t use it. 

Franklan shrugged. “Hon- 
estly, I don’t. But I’m not 
blinding myself to what the 
others will think.” He squint- 
ed professionally at the burns 
and dried the hands with a 
gentle blast of air. He picked 
up a large tube and squeezed 
a substance on them which 
was absorbed almost instant- 
ly. “There. You’ll be all right 
in a few days.” 



“Thanks,” Alsint said la- 
conically and stood up. 

As he went out the door, 
Franklan called after him. “If 
I see the captain. I’ll tell him 
I don’t think you tried to jump 
ship. I doubt that he’ll ask. As 
I said, service on this ship is 

voluntary.” 

Personally, Alsint didn’t 
care what Franklan told the 
captain. However, he was at 
a definite disadvantage. Next 
time they came to a planet, if 
he were to disappear, nobody 
would be overly inquisitive. 

T he tagging operation was 
far from complete — seven 
planets in the system and each 
had to be thoroughly investi- 
gated. Long-range investiga- 
tion, of course. A tag ship 
rarely landed, and then only 
when the planet under consid- 
eration seemed extremely de- 
sirable for colonization, 
enough to warrant closer ob- 
servation. 

It didn’t matter whether it 
had a breathable atmosphere 
or not, whether it was ice- 
bound or blazing hot. These 
were minor difficulties and 
engineering ingenuity could 
overcome them. There were 
other criteria, and it was for 
these that they were checked. 

Alsint went out into the 
ship. There was a lot of ac- 
tivity, but much of it was in- 
visible, electronic in nature, 
affecting only instruments. 
The ship had slipped into an 
orbit, the plane of which in- 



14 



F. L. WALLACE 



tersected the axis of plane- 
tary revolution at the most ef- 
fective angle. The ship went 
around twice while the planet 
revolved three times. In that 
period the mineral resources 
were plotted and the approxi- 
mate quantities of each were 
detenu ined. 

Larienne looked up as he 
came near. “This is a real 
find,” she said cheerfully. 

“I suppose you’ve located 
the heavy stuff,” he said, 
knowing that it was a super- 
fluous statement. 

“What else would we look 
for?” She bent over the small 
torpedo shape she was work- 
ing on. “Not just one, either. 
This is the second planet in 
the system with enough heavy 
elements to be worth set- 

“What’s the gravity?” He 
didn’t always share the en- 
thusiasm others had for theii’ 
discoveries. 

“The first was 1.6. This is 
about 2.3. A little high for 
personal comfort, but with 
the mineral resources there, 
the settlers can manage.” 
“What about atmosphere?” 
“The first hasn’t much, 
frozen mostly. This one has 
chlorine in it.” She grinned at 
him. “Your old theme, huh?” 
It was an old theme, though 
he didn’t argue it. He was en- 
titled to personal reactions. 
“Maybe. Would you like to 
live on either of them?” 
“Don’t have to,” she said, 
making an adjustment on the 

GROVvlNG SEASON 



torpedo. “Never get out on a 
planet more than twice a 
year. In fact. I've almost for- 
gotten what a year means.” 
That was the point, pos- 
sibly, though there was no use 
to discuss it. “Anything else 
of interest?” 

“We’re coming to a smaller 
planet. Land, oceans, warm 
enough, and with an atmos- 
phere we can probably breathe 
as is. Don’t know the compo- 
sition of the solid matter yet, 
but from our mass reading, 
it’s a good bet that there won’t 
be enough heavy stuff to jus- 
tify settlement.” She made a 
final delicate adjustment on 
the torpedo and began wheel- 
ing it to a launching tube. 
“This one’s in a rich system, 
though, and will probably be 
used as an administration 
planet — vacation spot too. It 
won’t go to waste, if that is 
what’s worrying you.” 

In a way, it was. It was too 
bad that so many planets tliat 
were othenvise ideal for hu- 
man habitation had to be 
passed over because they 
lacked the one essential. There 
was no help for it, of course. 
To settle planets, spaceships 
were necessary — and heavy 
elements to drive those ships. 
Nothing else mattered in the 
least. 

L arienne snapped the 

torpedo in place and 
pressed a stud. The dark 
shape disappeared. Out in 
space, it fell into an orbit 

)5 



which eventually would land it 
safely on the planet. 

“There,” she said with 
quiet satisfaction. “It’s tag- 
ged, and it will stay tagged 
until somebody digs it up.” 

It might be a month, or a 
hundred years, before Colo- 
nization got around to it. 
Meanwhile the torpedo was 
there, broadcasting at inter- 
vals the information that the 
tag ship had discovered. 
Somewhere in a remote plan- 
ning center, a new red dot ap- 
peared in a three-dimensional 
model of space, to be account- 
ed for in a revised program 
of expansion. 

Larienne brushed the hair 
out of her eyes. There was a 
smudge on her face. “I’m 
busy,” she said. “But I can 
get out of this if you need 
me.” 

As long as she was more in- 
terested in what she was do- 
ing, he’d rather not have her. 
He shook his head. “I’ll man- 
age,” he said, and headed to- 
ward the plant. 

The instant he entered, 
something seemed wrong. He 
couldn’t say what it was with- 
out investigation. It was a big 
complex machine as well as a 
plant, and even reading all the 
dials was not enough; visual 
inspection was necessary too. 
He stai'ted at one end and 
worked toward the other. The 
gauges indicated nothing out 
of the ordinary, but the plant 
whs in bad condition. 

It was something like a 

16 



tree, the trunk and leaves of 
which were sound enough, no 
discernible injuries, but nev- 
eilheless dying. At the roots, 
of course. This plant had no 
roots, merely a series of 
tanks and trays, each connect- 
ed to others in a bewildering- 
ly complex fashion. In that 
series, though, was something 
which corresponded to roots. 

He was near the end of the 
first row before he spotted 
part of the trouble. A flow- 
control valve was far out of 
adjustment. His hands were 
bandaged and clumsy, but he 
tried to reset it. It was jam- 
med tight and he couldn’t 
move it. 

He could call Larienne, but 
she was busy. So was the rest 
of the crew. With sufficient 
leverage he could turn the 
valve. He looked around for 
something he could u.se. A 
small metal bar leaning 
against the wall nearby seem- 
ed adequate. 

He picked it up — and the 
bar burned into the bandages. 
He knew what it was ; he 
didn’t have to think. He could 
hear the sparks as well as feel 
it. Fortunately his shoes were 
not good conductors and not 
much of the charge got 
through. 

With an effort he relaxed 
his convulsive grip, and still 
the bar stayed in his hand. It 
had fused to the bandage and 
he couldn’t shake it off. The 
bar was glowing red ; only the 
1‘elatively nonconductive prop- 

f. L. WAL^CE 



erties of the bandage — heat as 
well as electricity — had pre- 
vented his instant electrocu- 
tion. And the bar was sinking 
deeper into the bandage. If it 
ever touched his flesh, the 
charge would be dissipated — 
through his body. 

He had to ground it. The 
metal tanks which held the 
plant would do that, but also 
crisp the plant beyond sal- 
vage. He had to make a fast 
choice. 

fTOLDING the bar at arm’s 
length, he ran through 
the aisle, and, at the far end, 
thrust it against the side of 
the ship. 

The I’esulting flash stag- 
gered him, but he stayed on 
his feet. Though the metal be- 
gan cooling rapidly, it re- 
mained fused to the bandage. 
He laid one end on the floor 
and stepped on it, tearing it 

loose. 

It was a plain metal bar, 
made into a superconductor, 
with an unholy charge stored 
in it. This couldn’t be an acci- 
dent. It took work to turn 
ordinary metal into a super- 
conductor at room tempera- 
ture. Also it couldn’t be 
placed just anywhere. If the 
charge were to remain in it, 
a special surface had to be 
prepared. 

The trap had been set up 
for him, and he had walked 
into it. The bandage had 
saved him, nothing else. That 
was the one thing the un- 

GROWING SEASON 



known person hadn’t taken 
into account. 

Who? Larienne? She had 
access to the plant. But so did 
anyone else, just by walking 

in. 

Not Larienne. She had her 
ugly moments and might try 
to kill him in a fit of anger, 
but she wouldn’t plan it cold- 
ly, nor go through with the 
scheme if she planned it. It 
didn’t take special knowledge 
to sabotage the plant. Any 
control could be moved dras- 
tically and the plant would 
suffer. The only technical 
knowledge required was that 
of making the bar into a su- 
perconductor, and that knowl- 
edge she didn’t have. True, 
she could ask someone to do 
it for her. But she wouldn’t. 

Alsint sat down. The actual 
physical damage from the 
electrical shock wasn’t great. 
The certainty that someone 
had tried to kill him was. 

Why? Violent personal ha- 
tred for himself he could rule 
out. He’d been careful in his 
contacts with the crew. Onlv 
a psychotic could manufacture 
a reason to hate him, and psy- 
chotics didn’t last long on a 
tag ship. 

It had to be connected to 
the plant. Someone on the 
ship was trying to take it 
away from him, or one of his 
competitors had hired one of 
the crew to see that he didn’t 
survive. The last was unlike- 
ly. 

He had no proof that his 

17 




plant was better, merely a be- 
lief that it was. It seemed 
illogical that anyone would 
want to eliminate him on the 
strength of an untested belief. 

But except for Larienne, no 
one had enough knowledge to 
nurse the plant along for the 
required two years. Unless he 
remained alive, no one would 
benefit. 

He shook his head. It was 
difficult to add up and arrive 
at a sensible answer. One 
thing he knew, though — here- 
after, he’d have to be on his 
guard at all times. 

He could go to the captain 
with his story. He considered 
and rejected that in the same 
instant. He’d have to tell the 
captain everything, which 
would invalidate the test. He’d 
have to handle this by him- 
self. 

He got up and continued 
his inspection of the plant, 
making minor adjustments to 
compensate for the damage. 
Except for that one valve, 
nothing seemed far out of 
line. 

That done, he limped to the 
dispensary. His hand was 
aching where he had torn the 
bar loose and ripped the 
flesh. 

“Back again?” said Frank- 
lan. “Any new information on 
the enemy?” 

By itself, that was a suspi- 
cious statement. How could he 
Imow about the latest inci- 
dent? The easiest answer was 
that he didn’t. He was refer- 



ring to the time Alsint had 
nearly missed the ship. 

“Not a thing,” Alsint mut- 
tered. Unless he wanted to 
reinforce Franklan’s original 

opinion, he’d better keep this 
to himself. 

Franklan looked at his 
hand. “Whatever you’ve done, 

1 don’t recommend it. It’s not 
the way to get well fast — or 
at all.” 

“Grabbed something hot,” 
Alsint said. Might as well say 
that. The bar was now just a 
bar and no examination would 
reveal that it had been a su- 
perconductor. Same with the 
insulation it had rested on. He 
couldn’t prove anything. 

RANKLAN rattled the in- 
struments. “Nothing se- 
rious. This’ll heal on sched- 
ule, but it’s going to hurt 
while I fix it.” He administer- 
ed a local anesthetic below the 
elbow. 

It made Alsint dizzy. He 
sat down and closed his eyes 
while Franklan worked. He 
relaxed more than he intend- 
ed and then deliberately 
opened his eyes because he 
was drowsy and didn’t want 
to fall asleep. 

Over Franklan’s shoulder, 
behind the window that swung 
out from the dispensary to the 
corridor, was a little red bird. 
It was much like the one that 
had fluttered around as he had 
tried to get on the ship. Per- 
haps it had come in with him 
and hidden in some quiet 




18 



F. 1. WALLACE 



place until now. It was pos- 
sible. 

Franklan looked up. ‘^What 
are you staring at?” 

Alsint’s tongue was fuzzy. 
“Outside the window behind 
you is a little red bird,” he 
said, speaking distinctly to 
overcome the side-effects of 
the anesthesia. 

Franklan went on swab- 
bing, not bothering to glance 
behind him. “You’re tired,” he 
said. “And look again at that 
bird outside the window. For 
my sake, tell it to put on a 
spacesuit. If it doesn’t, it will 
die in a matter of seconds.” 
Startled, Alsint looked 
around. He was mixed up in 
his directions. He was facing 
the visionport, plain empty 
space, not the corridor. 

He blinked his eyes fran- 
tically, but the bird wouldn’t 
go away and it didn’t die. 
There was no air out there, 
millions of miles from the 
nearest planet. The bird flap- 
ped its wings in the airless 
space and went thi’ough the 
motions of singing. 

I T WAS ridiculous. There 

was nothing to carry the 
sound. But he could imagine 
hearing it anyway, through 
the thick armorglass of the 
visionpoi’t — a bird singing in 
space. 

Resolutely he closed his 
eyes and kept them closed. He 
had enough trouble without 
taking on hallucinations. 
Franklan finished the new 



bandage and tapped his shoul- 
der. “You can come out of it 
now. ” 

Alsint tried not to, but he 
couldn’t resist. He stared past 
Franklan toward the vision- 
port. 

“Is it gone?” asked Frank- 
lan. His voice was quiet. 

“It’s gone,” Alsint said in 
relief. 

“Good. These things hap- 
I>en occasionally. As long as 
you can adjust back to reality, 
you have nothing to worry 
cxbout.” Franklan rummaged 
through the medical supplies. 
“Take these. They may help 

you.” 

Wordlessly, Alsint took the 
packet and went back to his 
room. He was sweating and 
shaken. 

• Franklan hadn’t seen it be- 
cause he hadn’t looked, but 
there had been a bird out 
there, or there hadn’t. If not, 
Alsint’s contact with reality 
was precarious and he’d have 

to watch himself. Franklan 
had hinted at that. Maybe he 
wanted Alsint to believe it. 

But it didn’t mean there 
hadn’t been an actual bird. It 
could be put there in a plastic 
bubble that wasn’t visible 
against the blackness of space. 
If so, it was an ingenious way 
of harassing him. 

He relaxed at that formula- 
tion. It hadn’t been worth the 
effort, but it did prove one 
thing — his unknown antago- 
nist had an excellent imagina- 
tion. 



GROWING SEASON

T ime passed — days, per- 
haps, though that unit had 
little meaning on the ship. It 
was the work period which 
counted and nobody had both- 
ered to tell him how long that 
was. The last planet of the sys- 
tem was analyzed and the 
permanent markers sent 
down. The star was tagged 
and the ship proceeded on its 
way. 

What the destination was, 
Alsint didn’t know and didn’t 
inquire. They were going 
somewhere, to imcatalogued 
stars, and that was enough to 
Icnow. 

His hands healed and the 
bandages were removed. Lar- 
ienne was reassigned to help 
him. The rest of the crew, 
whatever they guessed, or 
sensed, said nothing and the 
normal pattern of life on the 
tag ship seemed re-establish- 
ed. 

His anxiety faded. It was 
not, he was sure, the end of 
the attempts to remove him, 
but he had time to think, to 
plan countermeasures. 

He was not wholly prepar- 
ed. He and Larienne were 
approaching the plant. The 
door was open and he could 
see inside. He glanced casual- 
ly at the row on row of mech- 
anism, and stopped. 

“What’s the matter?” asked 
Larienne. 

He moistened his lips. “Go 
around to the other side and 
close the door. Be quiet about 
it, but cl5§e the door quickly.” 



She stared at him curiously 
and started to go inside. 

He grabbed her arm. 
“Around, I said. Not 
through.” 

She shrugged and went 
around. In time he could s(^e 
the other door close. Then she 
came back. 

“What’s inside?” she whis- 
pered, adopting his own atti- 
tude, 

“Something I want you to 
see.” 

She peered in. “I can’t see 
anything. ” 

“It’s out of the line of vi- 
sion now, but it’s still in 
there.” He swung the door 
nearly shut. “Inside, fast. I’ll 
show you.” 

Obediently she went in and 
he followed, closing the door 
behind him. She waited. 

“The bird,” he said. “I want 
you to verify that it is ' in 
h6r6/^ 

“Bird?” She was puzzled 
and dismayed. “How did a 
bird get in here?” 

“I don’t know. I’ll figure 
that out later.” There was no 
need to whisper, since it 
couldn’t escape; nevertheless 
he did. “It’s a psychological 
stunt. The best way to stop it 
is to catch the bird.” 

She drew away uncertainly. 
“You saw it in here?” 

“I did, and I want you to be 
with me when I find it.” 

“Then we should make a lot 
of noise. It will fly up if it’s 
frightened.” 

“Good. You take that aisle 

F. L WALLACE 



20 



and ril take this. Yell when 
you see it,” 

They separated. He hunted 
carefully, moving everything 
that could be moved, looking 
for the flash of red wings. The 
bird was shy and had hidden. 

They met in the center 
aisle. 

In answer to his unspoken 
query, she shook her head. ‘T 
didn’t see it.” 

“It’s here,” he said stub- 
bornly. “I can’t be mistaken.” 

She started to say some- 
thing and changed her mind. 
“Let’s look again,,” she sug- 
gested. It was not what she 
intended to say. What she 
thought was plain from the 
expression on her face. 

A gain they went through 

the plant machine, search- 
ing. Every crevice, every 
hidden corner was examined. 
He peered into the machinery, 
the tanks and the trays, above 
and below. They looked, but 
there was no bird. 

Larienne stood beside him 
and glanced up at the ceiling. 
“Maybe it got out through the 

ventilators.” 

“It couldn’t,” he said harsh- 
ly. The ventilators were also 
filtei*s; a microbe would have 
difficulty getting through. She 
was trying to give him a way 
out, but he couldn’t take it. 

The room in which the 
plant machine was housed was 
not a simple open space ; there 
was structure throughout. But 
it was inconceivable that 



something as large as a bird, 
even a small bird, could es- 
cape detection. 

“I’ll take care of the plant,” 
he said quietly. “I want to 
think.” 

She left. He knew how she 
felt. It was worse because she 
did feel that way. 

He had scored against him- 
self. Larienne would say 
nothing to the rest of the 
crew, but it would come out. 
Emotional reactions couldn’t 
be hidden. And if there was 
ever an inquiry, she’d have to 
tell her stoiy. 

Franklan would see that 
there was an inquiry. That 
was his job. There was noth- 
ing particularly arduous about 
life on a tag ship, yet not 
eveiyone was suited to it. 
Monotony — and each person 
had to adjust to the others as 
well as the ship. There was no 
room for a person who saw 
things. 

It was a most effective at- 
tack, without danger for the 
man or men behind it. Twice 
he had seen something that 
wasn’t there, and there were 
witnesses to testify against 
him. It would be enough to re- 
move him from the ship. The 
subsequent treatment would- 
n’t harm him, but the ship 
would be gone and he’d never 
get back on. Tag ships were 
just too unpredictable; they 
came and they went as they 
pleased, and no one could say 
where they would next ar- 
rive. 



GROWING SEASON 



21 



Baffled, he tried to cata- 
logue the crew. Not Larienne. 
She’d live with him if he 
wanted, more readily now 
than before. Ordinary rules 
didn’t apply to her ; sympathy 
counted for most. 

Nor was it Franklan. 
Bluntly he’d given his opinion, 
but that didn’t mean he was 
responsible for this. The per- 
son who was behind it was 
keeping well hidden. 

Alsint went wearily down 
the line, adjusting and read- 
justing. 

On one of the handles was 
— a tiny red feather. 

HE STARED at it, relief 

forming nebulously in his 
mind. A bird had been there. 
How it had gotten in and then 
out again through closed 
doors, he didn’t know. That 
part was unimportant. It had 

been there. 

It wasn’t a hallucination, 
though for a time he’d almost 
believed it himself. Now he 
knew. 

Gingerly he picked up the 
feather. It was no proof, ex- 
cept to himself. 'That was 
enough. He could do some- 
thing about it. 

The trap for him was set, 
but wouldn’t be closed imme- 
diately. The ship would not go 
out of the way except in ex- 
treme emergency. In another 
four months it would run low 
on fuel and material for the 
tagging operation, assuming 
normal conditions. The ship 



would then return to the near- 
est inhabited planet. 

That was the way tag ships 
operated. Unlike other ships, 
freight or passenger, their ob- 
jective was not to get from 
one inhabited planet to anoth- 
er as fast as possible, but to 
stay away as long as they 
could. For that reason, of ail 
ships, they alone had to have 
the plant. No other food sup- 
ply was so economical of space 
and weight. 

Once they reached a planet, 
he’d be referred to the au- 
thorities for psychiatric ex- 
amination. Eventually he’d be 
cleared, but by then it would 
be too late. Unless he could 
forestall it. 

There w'as a way to do that, 
though it was dangerous for 
him, and he stood a chance of 
ruining the plant. 

He made up his mind and 
went back down the line of 
controls. Larienne might ques- 
tion some of the new settings, 
but she’d defer to his judg- 
ment. 

It took two weeks for the 
plant to decline so even the 
captain could see that it was 
impossible to go on. As mas- 
ter of the ship, he disliked 
abandoning tagging opera- 
tions even temporarily, but 
the crew had to eat. 

I T WAS a planet. Nothing 
out of the ordinary, there 
were many planets like Earth. 
Not many that were settled, 
though ; almost uniformly,

that kind of planet lacked 
the heavy elements that 
made colonization economical- 
ly feasible. 

It was pleasant and sunny, 
gi*eat grassy glades and an 
equal amount of forests. No 
intelligent life on it, so there 
was nothing to worry about 
on that score. Animals, big 
and little, but ordinary weap- 
ons would discourage them. 

Half a mile aw'ay was the 
ship, ready for instant flight. 
Not that there was anything 
to flee from. That was the 
way it had to come down if it 
was ever to rise again. 

The plant had been strip- 
ped to components and spread 
over the ground. An extensive 
layout, but it was necessary if 
the plant was going to get full 
benefit of planetary condi- 
tions. It had been put togeth- 
er to facilitate disassembly, 
and it hadn't taken long to 
remove it from the ship. 

A transparent canopy cov- 
ered it, protection from the 
elements. A sudden rainstorm 
could drastically alter the 
concentration of the vital 
fluids. There was also an 
electrified fence to keep out 
stray animals. 

Everything except root cells 
was exposed to the sun and 
wind. Under these conditions 
the plant began to recover 
from the deliberate injury he 
had done it. Why plants 
should recover so easily was 

my 

still a mystery, but genera- 
tions of plant mechanics had 



discovered that they always 

did. 

Alsint took the sundown 
shift. The plant could be left 
alone at night, locked up with 
the knowledge that nothing 
big enough to damage it 
could get in. It was better if 
there was someone to make 
minute adjustments from time 
to time, but that was not the 
reason he was there. 

S UNDOWN or sunrise, and 
s u n d 0 wn was better. 
Either time, men were outside 
the ship who didn’t have to ac- 
count for their whereabouts. 
More were out at sundown. 
And one of them, sooner or 
later, would be the person he 
wanted. 

The plan was simple. Give 
the man every opportunity to 
kill him, make it irresistible — 
but shoot first. If the man 
lived, he would talk. If he 
didn’t, there would be some 
clue in his personal effects. 
Dangerous, but if Alsint 
wanted to profit from his 
plant, he had no choice. 

Days passed and no one 
came near. He could and did 
retard the regrowth of the 
plant, but in that respect he 
was limited. He couldn’t be 
too obvious about it. The time 
came when he couldn’t stall 

any longer. In reply to tlie 

captain’s blunt question, he 
had to admit that in the morn- 
ing the plant would be in as 
good condition as he could get 

it 



GROWING SEASON

HE SAT that night in the en- 
closure, knowing this was his 
last chance. It grew dark and 
night sounds intruded. The 
lights in the ship went out. 
Only the light near him re- 
mained. He was careful to sit 
at the edge of illumination, 
visible, but a poor target. 

Animals snuffled in the 
brush near the electrified 
fence. They had leanied 
quickly and knew better than 
to touch it. And there was an- 
other sound — no animal. 

He quietly shifted his arm 
and held the light in readi- 
ness. He listened. Someone 
was crawling through the 
brush. He had to wait. It was 
hard on his nerves, being 
bait. 

He flashed the light on sud- 
denly. 

The man was half hid- 
den behind a bush and Alsint 
couldn’t see his face, but the 
gun in his hand glittered 
through the leaves. 

“Surprise,” said Alsint. 
“Don’t try anything.” 

The man stood there, but he 
didn’t drop his gun. 

Alsint didn’t like it. He 
couldn’t identify the man. If 
he ran back into the forest, 
Alsint wouldn’t know any 
more than he had in the be- 
ginning. He fingered the gun. 
“Come out where I can see 
you,” he said. 

The man didn’t move — 
waiting until his eyes adjust- 
ed to the light shining on him, 
decided Alsint. As a choice, 



his own life came first. He 
raised the gun. 

Before he could fire, a 
red bird attacked his eyes, 
squawking wildly. 

He didn’t drop the light. He 
tried to bat the bird away 
from his face, but it clung to 
his hair. Before he could 
crush it, he heard the whoosh 
of a gas gun. And the sound 
came from behind him. That 
was his mistake. There was 
more than one of them. 

He breathed once and then 
felt himself fall forward. 

I T WAS morning when he 
awakened, bright sunlight 
streaming into his eyes. That 
was not the reason his head 
hurt, though he could be 
thankful the man or men had 
used a gas pellet instead of a 
projectile. Whoever he or 
they were. 

He got up and staggered 
toward the ship. A few steps 
were all he took. The ship 
wasn’t there. He leaned 
against a tree and looked 
wildly around. The plant was 
gone too. 

Shakily he fumbled for a 
cigarette. Smoke didn’t help 
much. They had taken the 
plant aboard while he was un- 
conscious. They had left him 
alone on an uninhabited 
planet. 

A pretty planet and a use- 
less one. No ship ever stopped 
here except to revive a plant, 
and that wouldn't happen oft- 
en. It would be several life- 



24 



F. L. WALLACE 



times before another ship 
came, if one ever did. 

He stared miserably into 
the bright blue distance and 
thrust his hands into his 
jacket, and made a discovery. 
They’d left him a gun, at 
least, and ammunition. He’d 
be able to keep himself alive 
at a minimum level. 

There was a whistle in the 
distance. His head came up. 
He wasn’t alone. Larienne? 

It couldn’t be. From the di- 
rection of the sound, if it was 
Larienne, she was hiding in a 
nearby tree. But Larienne 
didn’t like trees. 

“Richel Alsint,” said a loud 
voice. Behind him this time. 

He turned around. There 
was no one there. Nothing but 
a red bird sitting on a 
branch. He started. The same 
red bird that had flown mys- 
teriously in and out of his 
life. If it weren’t for that 
creature, he’d be safely on the 
ship. He raised the gun. 

From one foot to another, 
the bird hopped on the 
branch. “Birds can’t talk,” it 
screeched. “Birds can’t talk.” 

The implication was clear. 
“Since you can talk, you’re 
not a bird.” The gun was still 
leveled. “Then what are 
you ?” 

“I could tell,” said the 
bird. It had stopped hopping 
and was watching him calmly. 
It was red, but sometimes 
blue. The colors wouldn’t re- 
main fixed. 

He lowered the gun in de- 



feat. He couldn’t kill a harm- 
less creature just for the sake 
of killing. It hadn’t been re- 
sponsible for this. 

“Don’t be so sure, Richel 
Alsint. Don’t be so sure.” The 
bird burst into a wild trilling 
song. 

He glared at it speechlessly. 
Bird it wasn’t. Either it 
could read his thoughts or it 
had been taught a patter that 
fitted his present situation 
with remarkable precision. 

“What do you think?” said 
the bird, cocking its head. 

He forgot about the bird. 
It was only a momentary di- 
version. “I’ve been ma- 
rooned,” he said dully. 

“It’s happened before. It 
will happen again,” chirruped 
the bird. “Don’t worry. I’m 
here.” 

It was, but he wished it 
would go away. 

“There is a note. Why don’t 
you read, read, read?” sang 
the bird. 

He looked, catching a 
glimpse of sunlight on metal. 
They had left something. He 
ran over to it, a few hundred 
yards away. 

And there was a note. He 
seized it feverishly. 

7 made them leave this. 
You may not need it, but 
you deserve to know the 
answers. 

Don't you understand? 
You were infuriating every- 
one, even me, and I liked 
you better than anyone on

the ship. You were always 
changing things for the 
sake of that daynn plant! It 
was too dry, so we had to 
have more humidity than tvc 
liked. Or the pilot had to 
keep the drive from vibrat- 
ing. Or this, or that, on ayul 
on and on! Who cares, real- 
ly ? 

A good plant mechanic 
ought to keep the playit alive 
for five months and then let 
it die. We can live the last 
m-onth off the remains. We 
have to go back every six 
months for supplies any- 
yvay. It’s expensive, I know, 
but until you can get a plant 
that reacts as we do, it will 
just have to die and be re- 
placed. 

I thought of staying with 
you, but I couldn’t stand all 
those changes — rain and 
sun — all the things an un- 
controlled planet has. And 
then there was that story 
of the bird. That was too 
much ! 

Don’t think too badly of 
me. At least 1 kept them 
from killing you. 

T here was no signature, 
but there was no doubt 

who had written it. 

“All of them,” he muttered. 
Not just one man. Everyone, 
from the captain down. Lar- 
ienne too. And they were 
safe. Who would bother to 
look for him when the cap- 
tain recorded in the log that 
Richel Alsint had deserted be- 



cause his plant was a failure? 
And, of course, it was going 
to fail. 

“The crew of the craft was 
daft, and you were the only 
one who was sane?” said the 
bird. “Don't you believe it. 
There are people on countless 
planets just like them.” 

It was true. The crew was 
part of the civilization. On 
those planets where it was 
possible to have parks, no one 
went to them. They stayed in 
the cities as the crew stayed 
in the ship. And on other 
planets — roofed over against 
poisonous gases, and inhabi- 
tants who never saw the sun 
— those planets were not much 
better than spaceships. He 
was the one who was different, 
not they. They had a mechani- 
cal culture and they liked it. 

He could see how he had 
irritated the crew in ways he 
didn’t suspect. They had 
wanted to get rid of him and 
they had. 

He looked down at the ma- 
chine they had left him, rob- 
bed, at Larienne’s insistence, 
from the major plant. Small, 
just large enough to supply 
one man, but containing all 
the necessary parts. A plant 
machine in miniature. 

She really hadn’t under- 
stood. He could live on the 
food this provided. But would 
he, on a world teeming with 
animals and covered with 
plants, real plants? He laugh- 
ed bitterly. 

“Now you know,” said the 

F. L. WALLACE 



26 



bird. “In the past there were 
others marooned. Just like 
you. I came from them.” 

He looked up wonderingly. 
“Here? On this planet?” he 
asked eagerly. 

A brilliant butterfly wan- 
dered past. The bird eyed it 
longingly and shivered into a 
rainbow of colors and darted 
away after it 

“Come back!” Alsint shout- 
ed. He couldnT find them un- 
aided. He had to have direc- 
tions. 

The bird didn’t return 
immediately. It played with 
the butterfly, flashing around 
it. Presently it tired of the 
sport and came back to the 
branch it had perched on. 
“Pretty bit of fluff,” it said 

breathlessly. 

“Never mind that,” said Al- 
sint impatiently. “What about 
those people ? Are they on this 
world ?” 

“Oh, not here,” said the 
bird. “A thousand planets 
away. ” 

Alsint groaned. The bird 
had been trained by a mad- 
man and was alternately rais- 
ing his hopes and crushing 
them. 

“Not so,” said the bird. 
“Here’s history: a hundred 
and forty years ago, a couple, 
plant mechanics, were ma- 
rooned — for the same reason.” 
It flew from the perch and 
alighted on the plant machine, 
dipping its bill in a collecting 
tray. “Good stuff,” it said, 
clattering its beak. 



A lsint said nothing. It 
would tell him when it got 
ready, not before. 

“The plant machine’s fine,” 
said the bird. “It’s a plant 
that’s been taken apart. Can 
you put it back together?” 
“No more than it is,” said 
Alsint. “No one can.” 

“No one yo^i know,” said 
the bird. “Here’s more his- 
tory: A hundred and forty 
years ago, this couple learned 
how to put it together — and it 
grew. A hundred and thirty 
years ago, they knew how to 
take an animal apart and keep 
it alive. A hundred and twen- 
ty years ago, they put the 
animal together and made it 
work in a new way.” 

The bird sidled along the 
branch. “What’s the differ- 
ence between plant and ani- 
mal ?” it asked. 

There were countless differ- 
ences, on any level Alsint 
wanted to think about. Cellu- 
lar, organizational, whatever 
he named. But the bird had 
something simple in mind. 

“There are some plants 
which can move a little,” Al- 
sint said slowly. “And there 
are some animals that hardly 
move at all. But the real dif- 
ference, if there is any, is 
motion.” 

“Right. You’ll get along 
fine,” said the bird. “A hun- 
dred and twenty years ago, 
this couple — ^^vho by then had 
several children — put an ani- 
mal together in a new way 
and got — pure motion.”

That was what had been 
puzzling him, and now he 
knew. “Teleports,” he said. 
“They can teleport.” 

“They can’t,” said the bird. 
“The mind’s best for thinking 
— they say. And they’ve kept 
theirs uncluttered.” The bird 
cocked a glittering eye. “I 
don’t know about minds. I 
never had one.” 

If they couldn’t teleport, 
how had. the bird got here ? 

Alsint glanced at the bird. 
It wasn’t perched on the plant 
machine and the wings were 
folded. Six feet off the ground 
it hovered, and not a breath 
of air stirring. 

“Behind you,” said the 
bird. 

It didn’t twitch a feather, 
but it was behind him now 
and he hadn’t seen it move. 

“Teleports, yes,” said the 
bird. “But they can’t do it. We 

do it for them.” 

The bird liad been outside 
the visionport of the space- 
ship. If it could teleport itself, 
why not air too? 

That was only part of it. 
The bird had followed him, 
but how had it foreseen this 
end? 

“Did you know this would 
happen?” he asked. 

“Plant mechanics are al- 
ways getting marooned,” said 
the bird. “We’ve gathered up 
quite a few. They work with 
the plant and a plant belongs 
on a planet. The rhythm is 
different from that of a ma- 
chine.” 



E KNEW that. He could 
feel it, though he had 
never put it into words. “Go 
tell them where I am,” he 
said. “I can live until they 
send a ship.” 

“A ship?” said the bird. 
“So slow? They don’t believe 
in waiting. They’ve got all 
the beautiful planets that men 
don’t want— just for the ask- 
ing, though they don’t have to 
ask. They need the right kind 
of people to live on them.” 

They didn’t believe in wait- 
ing. A shadow fell across his 
face. Alsint looked up. Some- 
thing was dropping down 
from the sky. Not a ship — ^not 
the conventional kind, any- 
way. It was the kind they 
would use. On planets on 
which all the food was grown 
naturally and no heavy ele- 
ments were needed, what 
would be transported ? People. 

Not moving a wing, it 
came down, first fast and then 
slow. It stood in front of him, 
towering, a giant abstract fig- 
ure of a woman with wings. 
There was frost on it. 

He went to it and it covered 
him with wings. 

There was no sensation at 
all except cold, which lasted 
only a few seconds. When he 
opened his eyes, the strange, 
beautiful ship was dropping 
down on another planet, more 
pleasant than the last. Men 
and women were coming out 
of the houses to meet him. One 
of them looked something .like 
Larienne. END

What did Professor Sanz- 

mann have in that cardboard 





By 

AVRAM DAVIDSON 



W HEN THE menace of Dr. 

Ludwig Sanzmann first ap- 
peared, like a cloud no bigger 
than a man’s hand, Dr. Fred 

B. Turbyfil, at twenty-seven, 
had been the youngest museum 
director in the country; and 
now at thirty-five he was still 
one of the youngest. Moreover, 
he had a confident, if precari- 
ous, hold on greater glories to 
come : the Godbody Museum of 
Natural History; Dr. Fred B. 
Turbyfil, Director. 

The salary would be splen- 
did, the expense account lavish 
and tax-free, and the director 
would have ample time to fin- 
ish his great work, at present 
ehtitled Man Before the Dawn 
— recondite, yet eminently 
readable. There were already 
seventeen chapters devoted to 
the Mousterian, or Neander- 
thal, Era alone. (It would be 
certain to sell forever to 
schools and libraries ; a big 
book, firm in the grasp, pro- 
fusely illustrated and done in 
so captivating a style that even 
a high school senior, picking it 
up unwarily in search of nudes, 
would be unable to extricate 
himself for hours.) 

Mr. Godbody, the future 
source of all these goodies, was 
a skeptic of the old-fashioned 
sort. “Where did Cain get his 
w’ife?” was a favorite cackle, 
accompanied by a nudge of his 
bony elbow. “Found any feath- 
ers from angels' wings yet?” 
was another. 

There was, at the moment, 
a minor hitch. Old Mr. God- 



29 



body affected to be shaken by 
the recent revelation of scan- 
dal in anthropology. From that 
respectable group of ancestors, 
whose likenesses were known 
to every schoolchild, from that 
jolly little club— j udgment fall- 
ing like a bolt of thunder — 
Piltdown Man had been expell- 
ed for cheating at cards. 

If Piltdown Man was a fake, 
why not all the rest? Java Man, 
Peiping Man, Australopithecus 
Aft’icanus — all bone-scraps, 
plaster of paris, and wishful 

thinking ! 

In vain, Turbyfil assured 
him that competent scholars 
had been leery of H. Piltdown 
for years; ugly old Mr. God- 
body testily replied : “Then 
why didn’t you say so?” 

Having lost one faith in his 
youth, the merchant prince 
was reluctant to lose another 
in his old age. But Dr. Turby- 
fil trusted his patron’s doubt 
was only a passing phase. 

In sum, Dr. Turbyfil was 
about to reap the rewards of 
virtue and honest toil, and 
when he reflected on this (as 
he often did) it amused him 
to sing — a trifle off-key — a 
song from his childhood, called 
“Bringing in the Sheaves.”-^ 

That was before the advent 
of Dr. Sanzmann. 

The two men had come to 
Holden within a few months 
of one another. Dr. Turbyfil 
from his two-year stay at the 
Museum of Natural Philosophy 
in Boston, and Dr. Sanzmann 
from a meager living translat- 

30 



ing in New York, whither he 
had come as a exile from his 
native country. Sanzmann was 
politically quite pure, with no 
taint of either far right or 
near left ; was, in fact, a 
Goethe scholar — ^and what can 
be purer than a Goethe scholar? 
He had a post at the local de- 
nominational university: Pro- 
fessor of Germanic and Orien- 
tal Languages, neatly skip- 
ping the questionable Slavs. 
Dr. Turbyfil was not an ungen- 
erous man, and he was quite 
content to see Prof. Sanzmann 
enjoy the full measure of lin- 
guistic success. 

But Dr. Philosoph. Ludwig 
Sanzmann was also an amateur 
anthropologist, paleontologist, 
and general antiquarian; and 
this was enough to chill the 
blood of any museum director 
or even curator. Such ama- 
teurs are occupational hazards. 
'They bring one smelly cow- 
bones, and do it with a proud 
air of expectancy, fully antici- 
pating the pronouncement of a 
new species of megatherium 
or brontosaurus. 

“My dear Dr. Turbyfil! 1 
have looked forward to this 
our meeting for so long ! I can- 
not tell you — ” Sanzmann 
shook the proffered hand, sat 
down, holding a cardboard 
carton as if it contained wed- 
ding cake, took out a handker- 
chief, wiped his rosy face, and 
panted. 

“Dr. Turbyfil !” the name as- 
sumed the qualities of an in- 
dictment. “What is that which 



AVRAM DAVIDSON 



they used always to tell us? 
Uhmiensch — ^Primal Man, that 
is — he was a stunted little cre- 
a-ture, like a chimpanzee, with 
a molybdenum deficiency, and 
he — which is to say, we — grew 
larger and bigger and more so, 
until, with the help of the ac- 
tuarial tables of the insurance 
companies, we have our pres- 
ent great size attained, and 
also life expectancy. And we, 
pres-u-mably, will greater 
grow yet. 

“But!” (Dr. Turbyfil quiv- 
ered.) “What then comes to 
pass? An anthropologist goes 
into an apotheke — a druck- 
store, yes? — in Peiping — oh, a 
bea-u-tiful city, I have been 
there, I love it with all my 
heai’t! — he goes into a native 
Chinese pharmacy, and there 
what is it that he finds? He 
finds — amongst the dried 
dragon bones, powdered bats, 
tigers’ gall, rhinoceros horn, 
and pickled serpents — two hu- 
manlike gigantic molar teeths ! 
And then, behold, for this is 
wonderful! The whole picture 
changes !” 

Oh, my, oh, my! thought Dr. 
Turbyfil, suffering. 

“Now Primal Man becomes 
huge, tremendous, like the Sons 
of Anak in the First Moses 
Book. We must now posit for 
him ancestors like the gi’eat 
apes of your Edgar Burroughs 
Rice. And how it is that we, 
his children, have shrunken! 
Pit-i-fiil! Instead of the pigs 
becoming elephants, the ele- 
phants are become pigs!” Dr. 



Sanzmann clicked his tongue. 

“But that is nothing! Noth- 
ing at all! Wherefore have I 
come to you now? To make 
known to you a something that 
is so much more startling, 1 
must begin earlier than our 
own times. Charles the Fifth!” 
Dr. Turbyfil quavered, “I 
beg your pardon?” 

“(Charles the Fifth of Haps- 
burg. In fifteen hundred and 
fifty-five, Charles the Emperor 
resigns, no retires? Abdicates. 
His brother Ferdinand suc- 
ceeds him as sovereign of the 
Hapsburg dominions, and 
Charles retreats himself to a 
monastery. 

“ ‘With age, with cares, with 
maladies oppres’t, 

“He seeks the refuge of 
monastic rest — ’ ” 

“Ahh, Professor Sanzmami,” 
Dr. Turbyfil began. 

“Yes-yes: I di-gress. Well. 
Charles and Ferdinand. A me- 
dallion is struck, Charles, one 
side — Ferdinand the other. 
And the date, fifteen hundred 
and fifty-five. Here is the 
medallion.” Dr. Sanzmann 
reached into an inner pocket 
and pulled out a flat little box, 
such as jewelers use. He open- 
ed it. 

Inside lay a blackened disk 
about the size of a silver dollar, 
and a piece of paper with two 
rubbings — the profiles of two 
men, Latin mottoes, and the 
date : fifteen hundred and fifty- 
five. Completely at sea, and 
feeling more and more sorry 
for himself. Dr. Turbyfil look-

THE OGRE 



ed at his rosy-faced and gray- 

haired caller. He made a small, 
bewildered gesture. 

“Soon, soon, you will under- 
stand everything. N ineteen- 
thirtv. My wacations — I am 
still in Chairmany — I spend at 
Maldenhausen, a little rural 
hamlet in a walley. Then things 
are quiet. Ah, these Chairman 
walleys ! So green, remote, en- 
chanting, full of mysteries! I 
drink beer and wine, I smoke 
my pipe, and go on long walks 
in the countryside. And — since 
1 am a scholar, and ever the 
dog returns to his vomit — I 
spend also some time in the 
willage archives. Many in- 
teresting things. ... A child 
named Simon. 

“In fifteen hundred and 
fifty-five, a child named Simon 
is stolen by an ogre.” 

Dr. Turbyfil pressed a fist 
to his forehead and moaned 
faintly. “Is — %vhatV* he said 
fretfully. 

“Please! You see the hole in 
the medallion? The child Simon 
wore it about his neck on a 
thong. They were very rever- 
end, these peasant people. An 
Imperial medallion, one wears 
it on one’s bosom. A photo- 
static copy of the testimony.” 
Prof. Sanzmann opened the 
box, removed papers. Photo- 
static copies, indeed, were 
among them, but the language 
was a monkish Latin, and in 
Gothic lettering. Dr. Turbyfil 
felt his eyes begin to hurt ; he 
closed them. 

Prof. Sanzmann, dreadful 



man, spoke on. “There were 
two witnesses, an old man of 
the name Sigismund, a boy 
called Lothar. It was winter. 
It was snow. The child Simon 
runs with his dog down the 
field. He shouts. He is afraid. 
Out of the snow behind him 
the ogre comes. He is just as 
they always knew ogres to be : 
Huge, hairy, crooked, clad in 
skins, carrying a cudgel. Ter- 
rible. 

“Lothar runs for help. The 
old man cannot run, so he stays. 
And prays. The ogre seizes up 
the child Simon and runs away 
with him, back into the fields, 
toward the hills, until the snow 
hides them. 

“The people are aroused, 
they are fearful, but not sur- 
prised. This happens. There 
are wolves, there are bears, 
there are ogres. Such are the 
hazards of living on the re- 
mote farms.” 

Dr. Turbyfil shivered. A chill 
crept into his flesh. He rubbed 
his fingers to warm them. 
“Folklore,” he said. “Old 
wives’ tales.” 

Dr. Sanzmann waved his 
hands, then placed them on the 
photostats. “This is not the 
Brothers Grimm,” he said. 
“These are contemporary ac- 
counts with eyed witnesses. I 
continue. The people go out in 
the storm, Avith dogs and pikes 
and even a few matchlocks; 
and since they huddle fearing- 
ly together and the snow has 
hid all foot-marks, it is not a 
surprise that they do not find

the child or the ogre’s spoor. 
The dog, yes — but he is quite 
dead. Crushed. One tremend- 
ous blow. The next day they 
search, and then the next, and 
then no more. Perhaps in the 
Spring they will find some 
bones for Christian burial. 

“The child had been warned 
that if he went too far from 
home he would be stolen by 
an ogre. He did go too far 
from home, and he ivas stolen 
by an ogre. So, fifteen-sixty.” 
Dr. Turbyfil ventured a small 
smile. “The child has been 
dead for five years.” He felt 
better, now that he knew what 
was in the carton. He visualized 
the card which would never, 
certainly never, be typed : 
'"Bones of child devoured by 
ogre in 1555. Gift of Prof, 
Lvjdtvig Sanzmann, Dr. Phil.” 

T he GOETHE scholar swept 
on. “In fifteen hundred and 
sixty, the child Simon,” he said, 
“is discovered trying to pilfer 
fowls from a farmyard in the 
nexten walley. He is naked, 
filthy, long-haired, lousy. He 
growls and cannot speak co- 
herent speech. He fights. It is 
wery sad.” 

The Museum Director agreed 
that it was very sad. (Then 
what ivas in the cardboard 
carton ? ) 

“Child Simon is tied, he is 
delivered up to his parents, 
who must lock him in a room 
to keep him from escaping. 
Gradually he learns to speak 
again. And then comes to see

him the burgemeister, and the 
notary, and the priest, and the 
baron, and I should imagine 
half the people of the district, 
and they ask him to tell his 
story, speaking ever the truth. 

“The ogre (he says) carried 
him away wery distantly and 
high up, to his cave, and there in 
his cave is his wife the ogress, 
and a small ogre, who is their 
child. At first Simon fears they 
will consume him, but no. He 
is brought to be a companion 
to the ogre-child, who is ill. 
And children are adaptive, 
wery adaptive. Simon plays 
with the ogre child, and the 
ogre brings back sheep and 
wenison and other foods. At 
first it is hard for Simon to 
eat the law meat, so the ogi*ess 
chews it soft for him — ” 

""Please!” Dr. Turbyfil held 
up a protesting hand, but Pro- 
fessor Sanzmann neither saw 
nor heard him. With gleaming 
eyes gazing afar, he went on. 

“It comes the spring. The 
ogre family sports in the forest, 
and Simon with them. Then 
comes again the autunin and 
winter and at last the ogre- 
child dies. It is sad. The par- 
ents cannot believe it. They 
moan to him. They rock him 
in their arms. No use. They 
buiy him finally beneath the 
cave floor. Noiv you will ask,” 
he informed the glassy-eyed 
Turb>iil, “do they smear the 
dead body with red ochre as a 
symbol of life, of blood and 
flesh, as our scientists say ? No. 
And why not? Because he is 



33 



already smeared. All of them. 
All the time. They like it so. 
It is not early religion; it is 
early cosmetic only.” 

He sighed. Dr. Turbyfil echo- 
ed him. 

“And so, swiftly pass the 
years.” Prof. Sanzmann patted 
his hand on the empty air to 
indicate the passing years. 
“The old ogre is killed by a 
she-bear and then the ogi’ess 
will not eat. She whimpers 
and clasps Simon to her, and 
presently she grows cold and 
is dead. He is alone. The rest 
we know. Simon grows up, 
marries, has children, dies. But 
there are no more ogres. 

“Not ever. 

“Naturally, I am fascinated. 
I ask the peasants, where is 
there a cave called the Cave of 
the Ogres? They look at me 
with slanting glances, but will 
not answer. I am patient. I 
come back each summer. Nine- 
teen hundred thirty-one, nine- 
teen hundrd thirty two, nine- 
teen hundred thirty-three. 
Everyone knows me. I give 
small presents to the children. 
By myself I wander in the hills 
and search for caves. Nineteen 
hundred thirty-four. There is 
a cow-tending child in the high 
pastures. We are friends. I 
speak of a cave near there. 
This, I say, is called the Cave 
of the Ogres. The child laughs. 
N 0, no, he says, that is another 
cave ; it is located thus and so. 

“And I find it where he says. 
But I am circumspect. I wait 
another year. Then I come and 



J make my private excawa- 
tions. And — I — find — this” 

He threw open the carton 
and unwrapped from many 
layers of cotton-wool some- 
thing browm and bony, and he 
set it in front of Dr. Turbyfil. 

“There was a fairly complete 
skeleton, but I took just the 
skull and jaw-bone. You rec- 
ognize it at once, of course. 
And with it I found, as I ex- 
pected, the medallion of Charles 
and Ferdinand. Simon had al- 
lowed them to bury it with the 
ogre-child because he had been 
fond of it. It is all written in 

the photostatic paper copies 

In nineteen hundred thirty-six, 
the Nazis — ” 

Dr. Turbyfil stared at the 
skull. “No, no, no, no,” he whis- 
pered. It was not a very large 
skull. “No, no, no,” he whis- 
pered, staring at the receding 
forehead and massive chinless 

jaw, the bulging eye-ridges. 

“So, tell me now, sir Museum 
Director: Is this not a find 
more remarkable than big 
teeths in a Peiping herb- 
shop?” His eyes seemed very 
young and very bright. 

Dr. Turbyfil thought rapid- 
ly. It needed just something 
like this to set the Sunday sup- 
plements and Mr. Godbody 
ablaze, and ruin forever both 
his reputation and that of the 
Holden Museum. Years and 
years of work — the seventeen 
chapters on the Mousterian 
Era alone in Man Before the 
Dawn — the bequest from old 
Mr. Godbody —

He arose, placed a hand on 
Professor Sanzmann’s shoul- 
der. 

“My friend,” he said, in 
warm, golden tones. “My 
friend, it will take some time 
before the Sanzmann Expedi- 
tion of the Holden Museum 
will be ready to start. While 
you make the necessaiy per- 
sonal preparations to lead us 
to the site of your truly as- 
tounding discovery, please 
oblige me by saying nothing 
about this to our — alas— un- 
scholar ly and often sensational 
press. Eh?” 

Dr. Sanzmann’s rosy face 
broke into a thousand wrin- 
kles; tears of joy and grati- 
tude rolled down his cheeks. 
Dr. Turbyfil generously pre- 
tended not to see. 

“Imagine what a revolution 
this will produce,” he said, as 
if he were thinking aloud. “In- 
stead of being tidily extinct 
for fifty thousand years, our 
poor cousins survived into mod- 
ern times. Fantastic! Our 
whole timetable will have to be 
rewritten. .” His voice died 
away. His eyes focused on 
Prof. Sanzmann, nodding his 
head, sniffling happily, as he 
tied up his package. 

“Incidentally, my dear Pro- 
fessor,” he said, “before you 
leave, I must show you some in- 
teresting potsherds that were 
dug up not a mile from here. 
You will be fascinated. Aztec 
influences ! This way . mind 
the stairs. I am afraid our 
cellar is not veiy well arranged 

THE OGRE 



at present; we have been re- 
cataloguing. This fascinat- 
ing collection formerly belong- 
ed to a pioneer figure, the late 
Mr. Tatum Tompkins.” 

Behind a small mountain of 
packing cases. Dr. Turbyfil 
dealt Prof. Sanzmann a swift 
blow on the temple with one 
of Uncle Tatum’s tomahawks. 
The scholar fell without a 
sound, his rosy lips opened 
upon an unuttered aspirate. 
Dr. Turbyfil made shift to bury 
him in the farthest corner of 
the cellar, and to pile upon his 
grave such a pyramid of un- 
catalogued horrors as need not, 
God and Godbody willing, be 
disturbed for several centuries. 

Dusting his hands, and whis- 
tling — a trifle off-key — the 
hymn called “Bringing in the 
Sheaves,” Dr. Turbyfil return- 
ed to the office above stairs. 
There he opened an atlas, look- 
ing at large-scale maps of Ger- 
many. A village named Mal- 
denhausen, in a valley. 
(Where there had been one 
skeleton, there must be others, 
unspoiled by absurd sixteenth- 
centuiy paraphernalia — which 
had no business being there 
anyway.) His fingers skipped 
jo^ully along the map, and in 
his mind’s eye he saw himself 
already in those valleys, with 
their lovely names: Frieden- 
thal, Johannesthal, Hochsthal, 
Neanderthal, Waldenthal . 
beautiful valleys! Green, re- 
mote, enchanting . full of 
mysteries.

IN A THOUSAND YEARS 



Coincidence, was this — a trail 



leading through many centuries — 



and pointing to but one man? 



IDICULOUS !” Graden 

XV swept his fingers 
through his mane of iron-gray 
hair, his faded eyes bright 
with anger. “You’re wasting 
my time with a pack of coinci- 
dences.” 

The younger man’s voice 
remained controlled and even. 
“I can show you plenty more 
evidence down at Central 
Archives.” 



“What kind of evidence?” 
Hart zipped open his brief 
case, taking out a file of thin 
plastic photocopy sheets. “1 
don’t blame you for doubting 
me. I didn’t believe it myself 
at first. Down at Archives we 
correlate records from almost 
every inhabited world. I’d 
been working on the land 
titles of Anrac — ” 

“Where’s that?” 



36 



“A planet way out toward 
the Rim. I noticed that a man 
called Eltro Xilden owned 
half the main city. He claim- 
ed his father bought the 
property when the place was 
being evacuated a hundred 
years ago.” 

“Evacuated, you said? Why 
was it evacuate?” 

“Anrac orbits one of the 
suns of a widely separated 
binary. It was settled three 
centuries ago, just after the 
system had been surveyed. 
Plenty of mineral deposits 
there — they built up a big 
population. Then they found 
out the orbit of the second sun 
brought it in on a long ellipse, 
with a close approach about 
every two thousand years. 
During the last century, it 
came close enough to Anrac to 
boil the seas, and for ninety 
years the place was deserted. 
Someone called Eltro Xilden 
bought all the property he 
could lay his hands on while 
the planet was being evacuat- 
ed — bought it for next to 
nothing. Now the present El- 
tro Xilden must be worth bil- 
lions from his holdings there 
— mines, any buildings that 
survived the heat, land around 
the starport — in fact, the best 
part of the city.” 

Graden snorted. “So the 
father was far-sighted and 
the son was equally shrewd. 
What of it?” 

“Let me go on. One of the 
team who made the original 
survey of the Anrac system 



three hundred and fifty years 
ago was also a man called El- 
tro Xilden.” 

Graden said nothing for a 
few seconds, his face expres- 
sionless. “Are you suggesting 
that an ancestor of these men 
gave wrong information — de- 
liberately?” 

“I’ll let you judge that in a 
moment. I’ve spent every 
spare minute during the last 
three months down at the 
Archives buildings checking 
every reference I could find on 
anyone called Eltro Xilden. 1 
found records from forty-sev- 
en planets scattered all over 
the Galaxy — some of them go- 
ing back before the collapse of 
the First Empire!” 



H art studied a sheet of 

paper. “Three hundred 
and eighty-six years ago, a 
man of this name bought out 
a tri-planet freight transport 
fl^t in the Ursan Group. And 
his signature was almost 
identical with the signature on 
a land sale document drawn 
up on Anrac last year. Here, 
look at these photostats. See 
for yourself.” 

Graden looked closely from 
one to another of the two 
copies, “They’re alike, certain- 
ly. Very alike.” 

“Far too alike for coinci- 
dence. Notice the same swirl- 
ing initial ‘E’ — and the cross- 
bar of the ‘T’ bending down 
to form one of the strokes of 
the ‘X.’ Here it is again, on a 



37 



copy of a mining contract 
made on Tau Ceti 3, about 
three hundred years before 
the earlier of those two.” 
Graden undamped his jaws 
with an effort. see what you 
mean. A remarkable similar- 
ity.” He looked piercingly, 
almost angrily at Hart. “Are 
you trying to suggest this is 
the work of the same man?” 

“I am.” 

Graden looked from one of 
the photostats to another, his 
lips moving slightly. “And 
these are not all?” 

Hart shook his head. “As 
you go back beyond that, the 
trail becomes a bit indefinite. 
The earliest reference I found 
to the name was in an article 
on psycho-electronics printed 
over a thousand years ago. 
The writer referred to experi- 
mental work done by a man 
called Eltro Xilden on a planet 
called Zeno. But I couldn’t 
make a direct check. All I 
know is that Zeno was a 
small, independent culture 
that was wrecked in the col- 
lapse of the First Empire.” 
“Are you sure the place 
was called Zeno?” 

“Yes.” 

Graden rose to his feet and 
walked slowly across his 
study to a wall-recess. He 
poured two drinks and hand- 
ed one to Hart. 

“I wonder,” he said, half to 
himself. He looked sharply 
down at the younger man. “I 
recall that Zeno used to figure 
in one of the more extrava- 



gant legends that grew up in 
the Dark Era between the 
collapse of the First Empire 
and the beginning of the Sec- 
ond Expansion. It was said 
that the Zenians had discov- 
ered the secret of the indefi- 
nite lengthening of the hu- 
man life. Did you know that?” 
Hart shook his head. “Nev- 
er heard of it. How was it 
supposed to work?” 

“As far as I know, it’s 
never been treated as any- 
thing but a fable for centuries. 
Varying stories, of course, 
ranging from simply a slow- 
ing up of the process of aging 
to a continuous renewal of 
youth.” He took a careful sip 
from his glass. “Psycho-elec- 
tronics, eh? Throws the leg- 
end into a different light, 
doesn’t it?” 

“I think it all fits.” 
“Perhaps. I think we have 
something worth investigating 
here. But tell me one thing: 
Why did you come to me?” 
Hart’s eyes were cool and 
steady. “Two reasons. First, 
you have plenty of money, 
enough not to miss paying my 
fare to Anrac. Second, you’re 
— well, old enough not to want 
to go all that way and tangle 
with a man like Xilden your- 
self, yet close enough to the 
end of your life to value the 
chance of prolonging it.” 
Graden flushed momentar- 
ily. Then tlie fire went out of 
him as quickly as it had ignit- 
ed. He looked away. “You’re 
right. I have nothing to lose 



38 



WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 



— and a lot to gain. But have 
you thought of this? Other 
men must have stumbled on 
Xilden’s secret during the 
past thousand years. What 
happened to them?” 

Hart’s smile was hard and 
taut. “I can look after myself. 
Well, is it yes or no?” 

“Yes, of course,” said Gra- 
den. 

B y the time he landed on 

Anrac, some of Hart’s 
confidence in his ability to 
handle the situation had 
evaporated. It had been a 
long, long journey out here 
to the Galaxy’s Rim. It had 
needed three changes of star- 
ships to complete the voyage, 
and with each vast leap out- 
ward into the void he had 
found himself in a culture 
more individualistic, more di- 
vergent from the pattern of 
civilization that he had 
thought to be universal. 

From Anrac, most of the 
Galaxy was visible as a spin- 
dle-shaped haze of light to one 
side. In the other direction lay 
only a thin sprinkling of stars 
against the empty dark, and 
the scattered flecks of light of 
other galaxies at unimagin- 
able distances beyond. Hart, 
who liked to think of himself 
as a man who knew his wav 
about, was acutely aware of 
the immense separation be- 
tween him and everyone he 
knew. 

“You’re way out on your 
own,” he told himself mirth- 

NEVER IN A THOUSAND YEARS 



lessly as the ship dropped to- 
ward Anrac’s surface. The 
starport was a rocky plain 
that stretched level as a table 
to distant crimson mountains 
that filled the western hori- 
zon. East and north, the far- 
off buildings of Anrac City 
gleamed with many-tinted 
metal and crystalline towers, 
some of them spearing a low 
bank of misty cloud. Low in 
the east, the primary sun was 
rising, a huge red disc behind 
bars of thin stratus. The sec- 
ond sun was high in the 
southwest, with the fierce 
blue brilliance of an electric 
arc. 

Riding down the escalator 
from the ship. Hart felt better 
as he breathed deeply in the 
thin, oxygen-rich air. Air that 
was rich enough to be intoxi- 
cating if he wasn’t careful. He 
had to fight down a boyish im- 
pulse to run. 

The official who checked his 

papers in the terminal build- 
ing looked at him with un- 
pleasantly observant eyes. 
“What’s your purpose in visit- 
ing Anrac?” 

“I’m collecting historical 
data on the evacuation,” said 
Hart. 

“Couldn’t you get all the 
data from Central Records?” 

“I want to interview some- 
one here.” 

The official’s eyes were un- 
wavering. “Who?” 

“Eltro Xilden.” 

The official pressed some- 
thing on his desk, muttered 

39 



something into an intercom, 
then gestured at a line of 
seats. “Wait over there,” he 
said cui*tly. 

Hart sat on the nearest seat, 
looking about him. The ter- 
minal building was transpar- 
ent-walled, and the intersect- 
ing beams of red and blue 
sunlight gave it a theatrical 
gaudiness that did nothing to 
make him feel at home. The 
men and women about him, 
mostly bare-limbed and in 
short, vivid tunics and capes, 
made his own gray suit seem 
grotesquely out of place. 

He was kept waiting until 
the building was almost 
empty. The red sun climbed 
the sky with maddening slow- 
ness. His watch was useless 
for local time, and he could 
make no sense of the clock on 
the wall, which had nine divi- 
sions and three differently 
colored hands, one of which 
made its full circuit in about 
half an hour. It had beeji 
around twice when his name 
boomed from a loudspeaker. 

“Lon Hart, Flight 447, re- 
port to Room 9.” 

He walked down to the 
room indicated and the trans- 
lucent door slid open as he 
approached it. A tjfiin, hawk- 
faced man sat behind a black 
plastic desk. 

“Sit down,” he said. As 
Hart sat, he remained motion- 
less for fully a minute, read- 
ing a paper in his hands. 
Then he looked up sharply. 
“You said you wanted to see 



Eltro Xilden. Is that right?” 
“Right. Fm collecting data 
on — ” 

“Thank you.” The words 
cut his sentence like a knife. 
“I may as well tell you at 
once; Nobody sees Eltro Xil- 
den.” 

H art met the hawk-faced 
man’s eyes. He reminded 
himself silently that the man 
in front of him was a third- 
rate official on a tenth-rate 
planet. He took a notebook 
from his brief case and spent 
some seconds opening it at a 
fresh page. 

“Let’s get this all straight,” 
he said. “What’s your name?” 
The official’s somber eyes 
wavered to the notebook, 
skittered to the name-board on 
his desk, then returned to 
Hart’s face with a somewhat 
changed expression. “That’s 
of no importance,” he said 
quickly. “I’m not putting any 
restrictions on you. I’m just 
telling you the simple fact 
that Xilden refuses to see any- 
one. ” 

Hart looked at the name- 
board, copied the name unhur- 
riedly into his notebook, lift- 
ing the book so that the other 
man couldn’t see what he was 
writing. He made meaning- 
less squiggles on the page un- 
til he heard the official 
swallow noisily, then looked 
up at him again. 

“Who gave you the infor- 
mation that Xilden doesn’t see 
anyone?” He kept his pen 



40 



WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 



poised over the notebook, and 
it gave him some satisfaction 
to see that the official was 
watching it as though hypno- 
tized. 

“Everyone here knows that. 
Xilden is probably the most 
important man on Anrac — 
he's president of Anrac Con- 
solidated, and that controls 
every major company on the 
planet. Also, he’s quite old. 
Leaves everything to his man- 
agers and directors, and to 
his granddaughter — she’s the 
only person he sees now, I be- 
lieve.” 

“Where can I contact her?” 

The official hesitated, his 
eyes on the notebook. “I don’t 
know. Try the offices of An- 
rac Consolidated.’’ 

Hart walked out of the ter- 
minal building on to a wide 
platform, from which the line 
of a magnetic shuttle ran 
straight across the plain to 
the distant city. He smiled as 
he recalled the official’s de- 
scription of Xilden : “He’s 

quite old.” The understate- 
ment of ten centuries. 

The bulletlike shell of the 
shuttle whistled across the 
plain; its internal stasis-field 
killed any sensation of move- 
ment. Hart stepped out on 
another platform at the side 
of a large square within the 
central part of the city, look- 
ing up at the towering build- 
ings. 

Some of them were burned- 
out shells, with empty win- 
dow-holes showing as black 

NEVER IN A THOUSAND YEARS 



rectangles in discolored metal 
walls — silent evidence of the 
ferocious heat that had seared 
Anrac during the close ap- 
proach of the blue sun. Most 
of the larger structures had 
been reconditioned and were 
obviously in use again, but the 
city was still relatively empty 
of people and vehicles. 

A SHORT flight in an aircab 
took him to the offices of 
Anrac Consolidated, out of 
the center of the city, fac- 
ing a park in which young, 
recently planted vegetation 
was beginning to spring up. 
He looked at the building 
from outside for a minute or 
two — it was less imposing 
than he had expected — then 
walked into the reception 
room. 

As soon as he gave his name 
at the desk, the receptionist 
checked her appointment pad. 

“Lon Hart? You’re expect- 
ed.” She buzzed someone on 
the intercom, while Hart 
glanced about him uneasily. 
The hawk-faced official back 
at the terminal had acted 
quickly. 

A door slid open and a 
thickset man faced him. “Will 
you come this way, Mr. 

Hart?” 

He led the way into a 
bright, bare office with a desk 
and two chairs, gesturing to 
Hart to sit down. He sat op- 
posite and pressed his finger- 
tips together. 

“I understand you wish to 

41 



see the Chief. What’s the na- 
ture of your business?” 

ORCING himself to be de- 
liberate, Hart said, “I 
want some information on 
Tau Ceti — on the mines there. 
I believe your Chief is the 
only man who can give it to 
me.” 

“Never heard of the place.” 

“This was a very long time 
ago,” said Hart. 

The thickset man looked at 
him fixedly. “I see,” he said. 
He glanced at a huge visi- 
screen filling the end wall of 
the office. “I think I’d better 
put you in touch with Sula. 
That’s the Chief’s grand- 
daughter. She’s the only one 
who has direct contact with 
him these days — handles all 
his personal business.” 

He dialed an instrument on 
his desk and looked toward 
the visi-screen again. The 
whole end wall seemed to van- 
ish, as though it had opened 
into a large, beautifully fur- 
nished room beyond. It was 
obviously not a room in Anrac 
City. A broad window in the 
far wall overlooked a wild 
sweep of coastline with crim- 
son cliffs, white surf and tur- 
quoise water. 

Into the field of the screen 
came a tall, slender girl in a 
close-fitting azure dress, and 
Hart felt suddenly frozen. She 
had ash-blonde hair and dark 
eyes with a faint upward 
slant, and every movement of 
her body gave the effect of a 

42 



catlike blend of suppleness 
and intense vitality. She look- 
ed questioningly at the thick- 

epf rn o y-i 

“Sula,” he said, “this is Lon 
Hart. He’s come all the way 

from New Altair to see the 
Chief.” 

The girl looked at Hart, the 
screen making her image in- 
credibly lifelike. “Can I help 
you?” she asked. Her voice 
was smoothly modulated and 
unexpectedly deep. 

He found himself trying to 
guess her age. She might have 
been anything between eight- 
een and twenty-five — eighteen 
at first glance, but with the 
poise and quiet sureness of a 
mature woman. 

“I’d like to see Eltro Xilden 
personally. I want some infor- 
mation from him about Tau 
Ceti — and about Zeno.” 

“Surely only a historian 
could tell you about Zeno,” 
said the girl. 

“A historian, yes. Or a 
man who had lived there.” 

Sula looked at him very 
steadily. Suddenly she turned 
to the thickset man. “Could 
you leave us, Carl?” 

Carl nodded briefly to Hart, 
then went out of the room, 
closing the sliding door be- 
hind him. The girl returned 
her gaze to Hart, looking him 
over as though he were a new 
species of animal. He had a 
moment of inspiration. 

“How do you know I’m not 
from Zeno myself?” he asked. 

“It’s unlikely, isn’t it? Zeno

was abandoned a very long 
time ago.” Her smile was 
naive, girlish, except for the 
calm watchfulness of her 
eyes. 

“Unlikely, yes, but it’s not 
impossible.” 

“I think you had better 
come out here to the house,” 
she said. “I’ll get an aircar to 
pick you up there in a few 
minutes.” She touched some- 
thing on a console and the pic- 
ture faded from the screen, 
leaving Hart staring at a 
blank silver wall. 

A lone, Hart grinned sav- 
agely, driving his fist into 
his palm. It had been easier 
than he had ever dreamed. 

But as he waited on the roof 
of the building, watching an 
aircar drop toward him from 
Anrac’s violet sky, a nagging 
thought began to creep into 
his mind. It was easy so far, 
yes — too easy. He took out the 
tiny solenoid pistol he had 
bought on one of the planets 
where he had changed star- 
ships on the way out here to 
the Rim. It had been made to 
look like a cigarette lighter. 
Small, but the only weapon he 
dared to carrJ^ 

Once he had identified him- 
self, the pilot of the aircar 
said nothing to him. He relax- 
ed in the back seat, watching 
the rectilinear net of Anrac 
City’s streets and avenues 
swinging below as they head- 
ed northward along the coast. 
Here and there across the 

NEVER IN A THOUSAND YEARS 



scorched i*ed countiyside were 
groves of quick-growing tam- 
arisks and other alien vegeta- 
tion obviously introduced 
-since the evacuation and re- 
turn. 

The aircar must have cov- 
ered a hundred and fifty miles 
before the pilot swept down 
over a curving bay walled 
with crimson cliffs. He landed 
in a courtyard of a large white 
house of synthetic stone, with 
an iridescent blue roof. There 
was nobody in sight. 

Hart felt a twinge of un- 
easiness — as he climbed out of 
the aircar, he had the uncanny 
feeling of being watched. The 
pilot took off almost immedi- 
ately, and Hart stood in the 
courtyard for a minute watch- 
ing the aircraft dwindle to a 
speck in the sky to the south- 
ward. He turned toward tlie 
house. 

“Come to the door by the 
yellow bushes.” It was Sula’s 
voice, coming through the hot, 
still air from some amplifier he 
couldn’t see. He walked across 
the blue-tiled courtyard to- 
ward a group of bushes like 
giant lemon-yellow cacti, and 
a door slid silently open to re- 
veal the cool interior of the 
house. 

He hesitated, looking 
around the wide sweep of 
horizon. There was not anoth- 
er building in sight. Apart 
from the far-off hollow roar 
of surf on the beaches at the 
foot of the cliffs, the only 
sound was the pounding, 

43 



pounding, pounding of the 
pulse in his ears. 

“Come on in.” 

He whirled to find Sula 
standing within the doorway. 
She was even more beautiful 
than he had thought — the visi- 
screen had only hinted at the 
freshness and youth of her. 
Without speaking, he went 
into the house, following her 
along the quietly furnished 
hail and into a huge lounge 
with transparent walls over- 
looking the sweep of red and 
turquoise coastline he had 
seen on the screen. 

A tall, gaunt old man with 
white hair and bleak, wintry 
blue eyes stood in the center 
of the room. Sula turned back 
to Hart with a dizzyingly bril- 
liant smile. 

“Here’s the man you cross- 
ed half the Galaxy to meet,” 
she said. “My grandfather — 
Eltro Xilden.” 

Hart felt Xilden scanning 
every part of his body, return- 
ing again and again to his 
face. For the first time for 
many years, he found himself 
at a loss for anything to say. 
Had he not known Xilden’s 
fantastic history, he would 
have put the man’s age at a 
well-preserved hundred. He 
wore a plain green robe that 
hung slackly from a large, 
bony frame. When he spoke, 
his voice had an incisive 
harshness. 

“You’ve come all the way 
from New Altair to meet 
me,” he said. “Why?” 



H art swallowed. He was 
acutely aware of the iso- 
lation of the house, of the fact 
that if he were to die in this 
place, nobody could ever trace 
him. Normally he found no 
difficulty in telling a lie. But 
now his life might depend on 
it. He was conscious of the 
seconds slipping mercilessly 
by while those chill eyes bored 
into his — eyes that must have 
seen every possible gambit 
used over and over again. 

“I’m making an investiga- 
tion for Central Archives,” 
Hart said. “We’ve noticed 
your name has been promi- 
nent on a number of worlds 
— at different times.” 

Xilden held up a thin, blue- 
veined hand. “Young man, 
you must forgive me if I ap- 
pear rather blunt. What do 
you want?” 

“I’m afraid I don’t follow.” 
The old man snorted. “I 
watched your conversation 
with Sula over the screen. 
You mentioned Zeno — a. plan- 
et that was wiped out a thou- 
sand years ago. No doubt 
you’ve heard of the legend 
that the Zenians had the se- 
cret of prolonging life. I don’t 
know what data you’ve found 
out about me, and I’m not go- 
ing to bother to ask. This sit- 
uation has come up before.” 

“I was merely carrying out 
an investigation — ” 

“Unoriginal. Almost every 
man who has tried to make in- 
quiries about me has used that 
story. Do you know why you 



44 



WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 



are the only one in half a cen- 
tury who has got this far?” 

Hart was about to say he 
didn't understand, but he real- 
ized the uselessness of fighting 
a thousand yeai*s of expe- 
rience with apparent inno- 
cence. “No,” he said. 

“Sit down,” invited Xilden. 
Hart and Sula sat on two 
of the magnetic-suspension 
chairs in the room, and Xil- 
den lowered himself stiffly 
into another. “It’s because of 
her,” he said. 

Hart looked at Sula, who 
was sitting demurely with her 
hands clasped in her lap. 

“You know Fm quite old.” 
Xilden’s voice shook witli a 
senile chuckle. “Perhaps even 
older than you think. And no 
matter what the legends say 
about the Zenians, no man can 
make the human body last 
forever. I want to see my 
granddaughter’s future as- 
sured.” 

Hart felt himself thrown 
completely olf balance. Sula 
lifted her eyes to his and 
smiled. 

“You must forgive Eltro — 
he has absolutely no tact,” she 
said. 

Xilden rose shakily to his 
feet and went slowly out of 
the room. 

Hart looked in bewilder- 
ment at the girl. “Have I got 
this straight?” he asked. “Did 
he mean — ?” 

She went to a large and 
ornate bar and poured out 
two glasses of emerald-gieen 

NEVER IN A THOUSAND YEARS 



liquid. She handed one to 
Hart, and as he took it he no- 
ticed the tapering perfection 
of her slim hands. The pale 
hair hung forward across her 
shoulders. 

“Is Eltro really your grand- 
father?” he asked. 

She sipped her drink before 
replying. “Not really. He’s my 
guardian. He knew my par- 
ents.” 

“A man called Eltro Xilden 
was a member of the research 
team that gave wrong data on 
Anrac’s orbit three hundred 
years ago. A man called Eltro 
Xilden wrote an article on 
psycho-electronics on Zeno a 
thousand years ago. It v'as 
the same man, wasn’t it?” 

S ULA’S eyes were very 
steady on his. Slowly she 
smiled, a calm, secretive smile. 
But she said nothing. 

“You’re very beautiful,” he 
said, and was surprised that 
he had said it. It was as 
though the words had come 
from him of their own voli- 
tion. 

“I’m glad you think that. 
From the moment I saw you 
on the visi-screen, I wanted 
to meet you. Eltro doesn’t 
want to see anybody these 
days, but when I told him, he 
— he didn’t mind my asking 
you here.” 

She was sitting very close 
to him. Her hair brushed his 
face as she put her lips close 
to his ear. 

“It’s quite true that Eltro 

45 



can prolong life. He’s per- 
formed the treatment on him- 
self very many times.” 

“Has he performed it on 
you?” 

“Well, of course!” 

He pulled back in alarm. 
“Then—” 

A small, delighted laugh 
rippled through her. “Silly! 
I’m twenty! I have a long 
time ahead of me, that’s all.” 
She put her hands on his 
shoulders and held herself 
away from him at arm’s 
length, her head slightly to one 
side. “I’m so glad you came 
here! I’ll ask him to give his 
treatment to you. He likes you 
already — and he’ll do it if I 
ask him.” All at once she be- 
came serious. “You have no 
illnesses, have you? That 
might complicate the treat- 
ment.” 

“None!” he said, his heart 
thumping almost deafeningly. 

“Not a one!” 

She sprang to her feet with 
the lightness of a gazelle. “I’m 
going to ask him right now!” 

She ran out of the room. 
Hart stood up and walked 
across to the windows, look- 
ing down over the sea. He 
smacked his fist against his 
palm. Of all the incredible 
luck — it didn’t seem possible 
that things could have run so 
smoothly for him. To come 
halfway across the Galaxy to 
make an almost hopeless at- 
tempt to find the greatest se- 
cret a man could have — and 
then have it handed to him 



freely, with the love of an at- 
tractive girl thrown in ! 

Once again he felt the dis- 
guised pistol in his pocket, 
and grinned happily that he 
didn’t have to rely on any- 
thing so puny. 

He was still looking down 
at the distant surf when Sula 
and Xilden came slowly back 
into the room. The old man’s 
arm rested across the girl’s 
shoulders, and his wintry eyes 
scanned Hart calculatingly, as 

though summing up every de- 
tail of his personality. 

“You really like him, my 
dear?” he asked Sula. 

“I really do.” She tilted her 
head on one side, looking crit- 
ically, mischievously at Hart. 
“I always liked blue eyes, and 
I just love that mop of black 
hair! Of course,, he could look 
a little more confident.” 

Xilden’s gaunt frame shook 
with a senile cackle. “Maybe 
we could change that. Eli, 
dear?” 

“I’m sure we could.” The 
girl looked up at him, and they 
both laughed. Hart felt a stab 
of jealousy at the intimacy 
between them. 

I N THE laboratory in anoth- 
er wing of the house, 
Xilden made him sit in a metal 
chair, while the girl stood 
looking on. Along one wall 
was a fantastically complex 
mass of electronic equipment 
with a strangely makeshift, 
jury-rigged appearance. Xil- 
den fitted a metal helmet with 



46 



WYNNE N. WHITEFORD 



innumerable hair-thin wires 
on Hart’s head, and strapped 
metallic contacts to various 
parts of his body. 

Hart knew sudden fear. 
Xilden had only to put a high- 
voltage current through the 
contacts, and his secret was 
safe! 

As if she knew what Hart 
was thinking, Sula stepped 
forward and put her hand on 
his. He remained tense, torn 
between fear and antici- 
pation, the two opposing 
thoughts keeping his mind 
thrashing in a circle. 

“I think it’s about time I 
took another myself,” mutter- 
ed Xilden to the girl. “You 
remember how to operate the 
dials, Sula?” 

“I remember. You get in 
the other chair.” 

Xilden climbed stiffly into a 
similar chair on the far side 
of the room. He sighed, look- 
ing down at his hands. The 
girl slipped a second helmet 
over his head, strapped con- 
tacts to his gaunt body similar 
to those he had fitted to Hart. 

“Ready?” she asked. 

“Ready, dear,” said Xilden. 

Hart felt something like a 
violent electric shock contort- 
ing his muscles . 

Blaclmess . the blackness 
of an abyss. A weird sensa- 
tion of looking at his own 
body, squirming in the chair 
as the currents went through 
it. Then nothingness . 

He felt a leaden sense of 
fatigue, and the light hurt his 

NEVER IN A THOUSAND YEARS 



eyes when he opened them. 
His mouth was dry, and when 
he tried to speak, his voice 
was a shaky croak, as though 
the muscles of his lips and 
throat were partly out of con- 
trol. Through the inertia of 
utter exhaustion, he heard a 
deep, ringing laughter, almost 
like his own laughter, yet 
somehow freer and more ex- 
ultant. 

“A good choice, Sula! The 
best I’ve had in centuries!” 

H art forced his eyes open. 

Colors looked slightly 
different, outlines of objects 
slightly blurred. The helmet 
and contacts had been taken 
away, but when he tried to 
rise to his feet, his body didn’t 
respond properly. 

He looked down at the loose 
green robe, the skinny, aged 
legs, the knotted blue veins on 
the clawlike hand gripping the 
arm of the chair. 

Across the room, Sula and 
the tall, black-haired young 
man turned — and Hart realiz- 
ed he was looking at a man 
who could have been a double 
of himself, but with a poise, 
an assurance that had never 
been his. The man walked 
across and stood looking down 
at him. As he blinked up, 
Hart’s watering eyes took in 
the vertical crease between 
the brows, the tiny scar on 
the angle of the jaw, the small 
mole on the side of the neck. 
And then the realization he 
had been fighting against 

47 



came in on him like an ava- 
lanche. 

He was looking at his own 
body. 

And these gnarled hands he 
held up in front of him were 
the hands of Eltro Xilden. 
He fainted. 

W HEN consciousness re- 
turned, he was lying on 
rocky ground near the sea. A 
little way off stood an aircar. 
Standing over him was the 
man who was his double. 

“Yes,” he said, and though 
the voice was Hart's, the in- 
flections were Eltro Xilden’s. 
“It’s true that a man can be 
immortal, in the sense of be- 
ing a continuously existing 
mind with an accumulating 
reservoir of experience. Un- 
fortunately, it needs a succes- 
sion of bodies.” 

Hart shook uncontrollably. 
“You can’t do this!” 

“I can. I have — many, many 
times.” 

“You planned all this from 
the beginning! You deliber- 
ately left a trail for me to 
find!” 



“Naturally. It takes a good 
mind to puzzle it out and a 
good body to make the trip — 
and I want both. I won't ask 
you to keep quiet about this. 
I’ve seen to it that people 
think Eltro Xilden is a senile 
idiot, anyway, and anything 
you say will confirm it.” 

Sula came along from the 
aircar and stood beside him. 
“Ready, dear — or do I call you 
Lon Hart?” 

“Don’t like that name much. 
Think I’ll change it.” 

The girl smiled up at him. 
“Why don’t you change it to 
Eltro Xilden?” 

“Not tired of him yet?” 

She pressed her cheek 
against his shoulder. “Never 
in a thousand years!” 

They went toward the air- 
car together. Hart stumbled 
to his feet, but when he tried 
to run after them, he fell 
headlong. As the car took off, 
he beat his fists in furv 

A. 

against the ground, his eyes 
scalded with tears. 

The aircar dwindled into 
the empty sky.

Sitting 




By DANIEL F. GALOUYE 




The difference between hunter and hunted isn’t 



intelligence — it’s who does the shooting! 



shimmering mote drop 
-1- ped toward the 




to 

the east. Like a silver mirror, 
it captured the luster of the 



sinking sun and hurled it back 
sparkling toward the city. 

A band of smudge-faced 
boys, their feet rooted in the 



49 





dust of the play lot, stared at 
the point of scintillating bril- 
liance. 

Four women, poised before 
the entrance of a supermar- 
ket, strained to watch. 

In the downtown district, a 
stock broker paused in mid- 
sentence as the reflection 
danced through the window. 
His client tensed, leaned for- 
ward for a better view. 

For a long while the radiant 
mote hovered, soaking up the 
shadows of dusk that drifted 
from the surface like a mist. 
Then it dropped quietly, hid- 
ing itself in a subtle contour 
of the plain. 

“Come on !” shouted a blond 
tyke as he retrieved the foot- 
ball. “We ain’t got all night.” 

The women in front of the 
supermarket exchanged glan- 
ces, then dispersed, three go- 
ing on into the store while the 
fourth trundled off her cart of 
groceries. 

Turning from the window, 
the broker thumbed through a 
stack of papers. “Here’s an 
attractive investment . .” 

Hundreds closer to the site 
said the mote was a great 
sphere of gleaming metal. 
But when the first detach- 
ment of Guardsmen pushed 
across the plain hours later 
that Friday night, they found 
nothing — or practically noth- 
ing. 

I T WAS almost noon Satur- 
day when Ray Kirkland 
ringed the hat rack with an 

50 



underhanded toss and shrug- 
ged off his topcoat, together 
with the chill of the plain that 
clung to it like a clammy film. 
He was a large, thick-shoul- 
dered man with a blunt face 
and stout jaw. 

Ralston, the managing edi- 
tor, laced him with a caustic 
eye. “You sure took your time 
getting back.” 

“Thought I’d try to squeeze 
a few more quotes out of 
Stoddard for the last edition,” 
said Ray. 

“Did the general find out 
where they dropped down?” 

“As I said on the phone, 
they pinpointed it with Gei- 
ger counters. But, like in the 
first twelve landings, there 
weren’t any other kinds of 
marks. ” 

Ralston, a tall, gaunt man 
with wiry graying hair, lean- 
ed back. “Did the general 
have any theories?” 

Ray shrugged. “The usual. 
No cause for concern — would 
have acted by now — probably 
setting down to replenish 
water or oxygen.” 

The editor made a sound 
that was somewhat like a sar- 
castic grunt. “I suppose he 
didn’t venture an opinion on 
why they have to land close to 
cities to get their water and 
oxygen ? ” 

“No. But he did suggest 
they might be so superior that 
they’d have nothing to gain by 
coming in contact with us.” 

Ralston squinted quizzical- 
ly* 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



“Stoddard,” Ray explained, 
“put it this way : If one of our 
naval ships had to land on a 
primitive island to fill its 
water tanks, the crew would- 
n't want to get involved social- 
ly with the savages.” 

The other chewed thought- 
fully on a pencil. “At least 
that's a different line of 
speculation. Put your new 
lead on it for the final.” 

Ray started for his desk. 
“Kirkland!” one of the re- 
porters called. “Telephone — 
your father-in-law.” 

“That you, Ray boy?” the 
receiver rasped eagerly in his 
ear when he picked it up, 
“Drop by Clark's store and 
bring home a box of number 
five shells, will you?” 

“Duck season doesn’t open 
for another week,” Ray re- 
minded him, annoyed. 

The old man laughed. 
“Nothing like being prepared. 
And don’t forget, son — you’re 
going out in the marsh with 
me tomorrow.” 

Ray slumped in the chair. 
He’d forgotten about the 
blind. A hell of a way to spend 
Sunday. And Alice would sulk 
if he didn’t pamper the old 
boy. 

AT SUPPER, his father-in- 
law sat across the table, half 
hidden behind a mound of de- 
coys that congregated around 
his plate as though it were a 
lush feeding pond. 

“As I figure it,” Ray was 
saying, “since all these land- 



ings were close to cities, there 
must be a purpose behind 
them in connection with the 
cities. There ought to be some 
tangible results. I’m sure if I 
looked close enough, I might 
find something that’s different 
from what it was yesterday.” 

“But giving up your Sun- 
day!” Alice exclaimed. “I 
won’t have that! You do 
enough for that paper.” 

He hunched forward. “But 
think of the recognition I 
could get . His voice trail- 
ed into silence as she merely 
shook her head. 

The old man pushed a pair 
of dusky brown pintails out of 
the way and straightened with 
no small amount of resent- 
ment. 

“Tomorrow’s the only day 
we have to fix that blind, son,” 
he said sobei'ly, “if we’re go- 
ing to be ready for Satur- 
day. ” 

Ray cast him a glance of 
sullen hostility. “But don’t 
you understand. Dad? There’s 
been a landing near here 
and — ” 

“And try to get back from 
that swamp early, Raymond,” 
Alice broke in. “There’s a new 
house in the subdivision that 
may be just what we’re look- 
ing for. It’s on that corner lot 
— where you said you’d like to 
build.” 

Enheartened at the unex- 
pected prospect of not having 
to spend his entire day in the 
swamp, he smiled gratefully. 

But his smile changed to a 



SiniNG DUCK 



51 



puzzled frown. “There’s no 
house on that corner.” 

“Of course there is, dear. A 
small Cape Cod. I walked past 
it at noon.” 

“It wasn’t there when I 
drove by this morning,” he 
insisted. 

The existence or nonexist- 
ence of the Cape Cod remain- 
ed unsettled as Alice, disinter- 
ested, busied herself with 
gathering up the dishes. 

Dad proudly picked up two 
green-winged teals with stu- 
pid blunt heads and stubby 
necks. He held one in each 
hand. “It’d take a darn smart 
duck to be suspicious of these, 
wouldn’t it, son?” 

S UNDAY in the marsh was 
particularly tedious and 
frustrating as Ray subordin- 
ated his professional interest 
in the reported landing to the 
whims of his father-in-law 
and paddled down a nar- 
row waterway. The raucous 
squawks of the mallard hen, 
as produced by the old man’s 
duck call, made the monotony 
no more endurable as they 
reached a pond adjoining the 
central lake. 

A flock of sleek-headed can- 
vasbacks hugged the northern 
edge of the pothole. The lead 
male, tense and alert, stretch- 
ed his neck to keep a wary eye 
on the skiff. 

Two females, preening 
themselves in the reeds along 
the shore, looked up in alarm. 
Several of the younger 



ducks clustered uneasily, 
training their beady eyes al- 
ternately on the lead bird and 
the skiff as it glided through 
the slough into the lake. 

When Ray glanced back 
over the top of the saw grass, 
the ducks had recovered froip 
the intrusion. 

The lead male was swim- 
ming among the others, as 
though reassuring them. The 
two hens on shore had return- 
ed nonchalantly to their 
preening. And the yearlings 
were dispersing from their 
cluster and spreading out 
boldly once more over the sur- 
face of the pothole. 

Two of the larger males left 
the main group and swam 
over to the clouded water 
where the skiff had passed. 
They glided in circles, in- 
specting the area curiously. 

Ray paddled into the blind 
and helped his father-in-law 
onto the platform. But the 
structure was only half con- 
cealed by the reeds they had 
used to camouflage it the year 
before. 

The old man reached back 
into the boat and untied Uis 
bundle of tools, arranging a 
saw, hammer, pliers and roll 
of wire on the platform. 

The lead canvasback from 
the pothole was in the air 
now. Flying over the lake, he 
dipped down occasionally to 
touch the water and peer into 
clumps of saw grass. 

“Damned drakt^'s trying to 
see where we went,” Dad said 



52 



DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



T 

irately. “Wouldn’t want him 
to get wise to our setup and 
louse things up for next Sat- 
urday.” 

The big duck rose higher, 
banked and came in directly 
over the blind, squawking 
stridently as it spotted the 
men. 

Dad reared up from the 
sack of tools, clutching his 
twelve-gauge automatic. His 
florid face fi'oze in an expres- 
sion of delight as he swept the 
butt to his shoulder and sent 
the barrel arching past Ray’s 
shoulder. 

Instinctively, Ray hurled 
himself on the platform. The 
gun went off, its spread of 
number-five shot roaring by 
within searing range of his 
face. 

“Got him!” the old man 
shouted exuberantly. 

T he shotgun blast was still 
a far-away buzzing in his 
ear as Ray drove up in front 
of the Cape Cod that after- 
noon. Surrounded by new 
shrubbery, it was a neat little 
bungalow that surveyed the 
freshly turned ground around 
it. 

“See?” Alice said smugly. 
“I told you they built on this 
corner. ” 

The sign next to the walk 
identified it as a product of 
Castle Estates, Inc., and an- 
nounced that the four-kitchen, 
one-and-a-half -bedroom home 
was open for inspection. 

Ray did a double-take. The 



sign (lid say “four kitchens.” 

“Wait here,” he told Alice, 
still skeptical that a complete 
house could have been built in 
less than three days. “I’ll see 
if the agent’s inside.” 

At the entrance, he pushed 
the bell. But the button would- 
n’t budge. Defects, so soon ? 

He tried the buzzer again, 
gave it up, and knocked on the 
door. But with the first rap, 
his fist went through the oak 
paneling as though it were 
crisp cardboard. 

Swearing, he tried to pull 
his hand from the shattered 
panel. The door came off at 
the hinges and folded over 
limply as it fluttered to the 
ground. 

“For goodness sake, Ray- 
mond!” Alice called impa- 
tiently from the car. “What 
are you doing?’' 

Confounded, he entered. 

But there was no inside to 
the house. 

From the landing, he step- 
l^ed down onto a mud floor 
with a sickly matting of 
brown, sun-starved grass. 
Overhead was the inverted 
“V” of the roof — no ceiling 
joists, no rafters. And the 
walls — it was as though they 
had been poured from a mold, 
with imperfections here and 
there in the form of raised 
ridges, like seepage seams 
from matrices that had failed 
to match evenly. 

Tipping his hat up off his 
forehead, he walked around 
surveying the eviscerated 



SiniNG DUCK 



53 



house. Probably something 
new in prefabricated con- 
struction, he decided. Might 
bear looking into for a Sun- 
day supplement yarn. 

Backing toward the door, 
he started as something sharp 
nudged him in the side. He 
turned and almost knocked 
over a contraption he hadn’t 
noticed before. Mounted on 
spindly legs, it resembled a 
surveyor’s transit, with the 
telescope pointed through a 
window in the general direc- 
tion of a row of ligustrum 
plants. 

Interested, he inspected the 
thing, running his hand over 
its slick metal surface. His 
fingers touched a protuber- 
ance on the side of the cylin- 
der and an almost inaudible, 
high-pitch humming erupted 
in his ear, crescendoed until it 
ended with an abrupt clich. 

He thrust his hands guiltily 
into his pockets, hoping he 
hadn’t disturbed some delicate 
adjustment that might make 
a construction worker catch 

hell the next day. 

Turning to leave, he almost 
tripped over something else 
he hadn’t noticed previously 
— a wax-leafed ligustrum 
plant that lay on the mud 
floor, its roots shining and 
moist as though it had just 
been plucked from the soil. 

Outside, as he strode to- 
ward Alice’s impatient grim- 
ace, his eyes swept the row of 
ligustrums. There was a 
breach in the hedge where a 



vandal had no doubt uprooted 
the plant. 

COURSE it isn’t 
V/ ours!” exclaimed Au- 
gust S a n d i f e r, developer. 

“Castle Estates doesn’t deal 
in cracker boxes! We have a 
motto: ‘Every Castle-Built 

Home Is a Home-Built Castle’ 
and ...” 

Ray eased the receiver far- 
ther from his ear. On his desk 
before him was spread the 
Monday morning mail edition 
with its story of the two new 
landings — one east of Denver 
and the other near San Diego. 

“You mean you didn’t build 
the Cape Cod?” 

“It wasn’t there Friday,” 
Sand if er snapped. “It’s there 
now. That’s all I know about 
it.” 

“How do you suppose it got 
there?” 

“One of those prefab outfits 
must have gotten their deliv- 
eiy addresses mixed. We’ve 
got the city permit division 
out there now. If they can’t 
tell us who is responsible, 
we’re going to put a match to 
the damned thing!” 

Ray checked with the per- 
mit office before he sent out a 
photographer. Then he started 
in on the story, featurizing it 
heavily : 

FOUND : House with 4 

Kitchens 

City officials and a local 
housing developer were

stumped today over the 
enigma of a misplaced pi*e- 
fabricated house . 

It rated a byline and a spot 
on the bottom of page one for 
the first street edition. Sample 
copies of the run were shut- 
tled up from the press room 
just as Balston came in. 

The managing editor settled 
down in his chair, spread the 
paper on his desk and prompt- 
ly recoiled ceilingward, bel- 
lowing, “Kirkland! Come 
here!” 

Ray went over uncertainly. 
“You walked into this 
damned thing wide open!” 
Balston’s eyes darted incrim- 
inatingly from the front page 
to Ray. “Don’t you know a 
promotion trick when you see 
one?” 

“It’s no publicity stunt,” 
Ray objected. “Sandifer didn’t 
come to us. I went — ” 
Exasperated, Balston brush- 
ed him aside. “Hawkins!” he 
shouted at the city editor. 
“Get that thing out of the 
paper and find something 
legitimate for Kirkland to 
do!” 

“Ray,” one of the reporters 
called from a rear desk. “San- 
difer’s on the phone again. 
Says that house is gone — and 
two of his agents with it.” 

The managing editor shot 
up and spun around. “Tell him 
to peddle his promotion stuff 
somewhere else ! ” 

Ray went over to the city 
editor’s desk. 



“I didn’t think he’d take it 
that way,” Hawkins sympa- 
thized. “Check this out for a 
l^ossible human interest an- 
gle.” 

He reached into the assign- 
ment book and selected a 
classified ad clipping : 

FOR SALE, CHEAP: One 
giant mutated sea horse, 
complete with Jmrness and 
aqua-sled. Apply Dr. Whit- 
more Vandell, Rt. 4, Sand 
Beach. 

T he advertisement, what- 
ever its purpose, had 
drawing power, Ray conceded 
as he turned off the highway 
toward the dumpy white 
frame structure that squatted 
half in the water like a centi- 
pede on its creosoted pilings. 
There were three cars pai-ked 
randomly on a level area a 
short distance from the beach 
house. A fourth was throwing 
up a dust barrage on the road 
ahead of him. 

By the time he drew uj) 
next to the newly arrived ve- 
hicle, its driver was threading 
his way among boulders and 
scrubby gro\\i:h towai-d the 
house. Ray sat in the car and 
traced the man’s progress 
along the path — behind a 
rock, across a sandj’’ stretch, 
behind a bush . 

There was the annoying, 
high-pitch buzzing of a mos- 
quito in his ear and he fanned 
the air to chase it away. His 
eyes, however, remained on 



SiniNG DUCK 



55 



the last bush behind which 
the man had disappeared. A 
minute passed and still he 
hadn’t emerged. 

Curious, Ray started down 
the path, keeping the bush and 
house in sight. But when he 
reached the spot where the 
man should have been, he 
wasn’t there. 

Tense and suspicious, he 
stood staring hesitantly at the 
house. His shadow was an al- 
most black patch on the in- 
tensely white sand. The muf- 
fled sound of surf on rock was 
a subdued whisper. In the dis- 
tance, a gull circled above the 
water, wailing plaintively. 

An abrupt movement l)e- 
yond a window on his 
right attracted his attention. 
Through the pane he saw a 
small, tubular object resem- 
bling a compact telescope on 
a tripod. It was a duplicate of 
the transitlike instrument in 
the window of the Cape Cod ! 

'The tube swiveled in his di- 
rection and he squinted to 
make out the shadowy form 
that lurked behind it — some- 
thing huge, not human. Thin, 
jointless arms extended from 
a rotund and scaly gray torso 
to coil like tendrils around the 
transit. An even more bulbous 
head swung around with the 
instrument, following him as 
he backed away from the 
house in fright. If there were 
eyes in that head, they were 
hidden in a mass of scales and 
lesser tendrils. 

Bristling with fear, he re- 



membered the transit in the 
Cape Cod and the high-pitch- 
ed humming it had produced 
when he touched the tube. It 
was a sound suspiciously sim- 
ilar to the buzzing of the 
mosquito he had heard onl\’^ 
minutes earlier — at the same 
time the man had vanished 
from behind the bush! 

The telescope steadied on 
him and he whirled and 
raced toward the nearest 
boulder, skirting a clump of 
bushes and flushing a startled 
seagull from concealment be- 
hind the foliage. 

The humming sounded 
again and the bush disappeai - 
ed, as though it had been up- 
rooted and flung out of sigl'it 
at a speed too fast for the eye 
to follow. Gone too was the 
gull in midflight. 

H e dived behind the 

rock, remembering the 
ligustrum he had almost stum- 
bled over in the Cape Cod. 
Now he was certain the plant 
hadn’t been there before he 
touched the transit ! 

The high-pitched note wail- 
ed again and he felt the rock 
vibrate before him. Appre- 
hensively, he pressed closer 
against the boulder. Some of 
it made sense now. He had 
suggested looking for a pur- 
pose behind the landing, 
scouting for effects that had- 
n’t existed before. Was this — 
and the Cape Cod too — part of 
those effects? 

“Help me! Please help me!”

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



He started. The cry had 
come from the house. One of 
the windows on the side was 
open and a young woman in 
a torn dress, her face strealced 
with terror, leaned half out, 
screaming. 

“Jump!” he called. “Run 
along the beach! They’ve got 
the thing pointed this way!” 

Her slim white hands grip- 
ped the sill, but she only 
stared frantically at him, 
paralyzed with terror. 

“Help me! Please help me!” 

He seized a rock and hurled 
it at the transit in the front 
window. It went wild, crash- 
ing against the house. The 
second hurtled through the 
window but missed also. The 
third hit the tube squarely and 
it toppled out of sight. 

Bolting around to where 
the girl was, he seized her arm 
and hauled her over the sill. 

“Help me ! Please help me !” 

He grabbed her hand to 
race away, but she almost 
collapsed. He slung her over 
his shoulder, running along 
the bluff and leaping into a 
gully that chielded them from 
the house. 

Climbing out of the shallow 
ravine at a point close to his 
car, he set her on the ground. 
She swayed, then steadied. 
But there was only panic on 
her face. 

“Help me! Please help me!” 
Her eyes were focused beyond 
him and her cries were un- 
changed from the first time he 
had heard them. 



Suddenly confounded, he 
backed away. The girl only 
stood there, repeating her des- 
perate plea. Then he saw the 
rough ridge that ran from her 
temple, along her cheek, neck 
and shoulder and down the 
outside of her arm — like im- 
perfections in an object cast 
from a matrix. 

Sickened and horrified, he 
reeled back to the car. 

Her unvarying cries fol- 
lowed him as her lips moved, 
but too methodically and not 
in synchronization with the 
words. 

He sent the car plunging up 
the dirt road toward the high- 
way. When he looked back, 
the girl wasn’t there any long- 
er — nor were the other four 
cars and the beach house. 

But there was something 
else, speeding above the road 
behind him — a vague symmet- 
rical shadow, like the merest 
suggestion of an oval-shaped 
cloud. 

He reached the highway 
and swerved recklessly into 
the stream of traffic. Through 
his rear-view mirror, he 
watched the patch of dense 
haze pause at the intersec- 
tion, as though confused. Then 
it turned and streaked off 
southward, gaining altitude. 
In its path, perhaps ten miles 
away, a fragment of silver 
glistened radiantly in the sky, 

R ay pounded his fist on the 
managing editor’s desk. 
“Sure I came straight back 



SiniNG DUCK

here. You think this is the 
kind of thing you go chat with 
Chief Johnson about?” 

“So you came here instead, 
expecting to find me less 
skeptical ?” Balston demand- 
ed. 

Ray bent over tensely. 
“Don’t you see? The Cape 
Cod, the beach house, the 
landing, the ad in the paper 
— they’re all connected! And 
there are other ads that 
look phony. Check the paper. 
You’ll see them.” 

The managing editor sat up. 
“Look, Kirkland. Mow'd you 
like to take a day or two off?” 
“You don’t believe me!” 

A half-dozen staff membei’s, 
crowded around them, dis- 
persed respectfully. Across 
the room, Hawkins hunched 
busily over the city desk, not 
doing a vei*y good job of pre- 
tending to be preoccupied. He 
sighed gratefully as the phone 
rang and he had to answer it. 

“The Cape Cod, the beach 
house,” Ray went on, “don’t 
you see they’re traps — de- 
vices to lure people within 
range of those things? This 
may be happening all over!” 
“Why lure people?” Balston 
asked. “If they’re as advanced 
as you’re implying, they 
shouldn’t have to use decep- 
tion.” 

“I don’t pretend to have all 
the answers. I’m just telling 
you what I know. It’s your job 
to see that the facts get to the 
public.” 

The city editor replaced his 



phone on the hook. “State Po- 
lice Headquarters,” he called 
over, “says there’s no beach 
house out there.” 

Ray spread his hands. “I 
told you that when I came in. 
Didn’t the Cape Cod disappear 
too — after Sand if er and I 
found out it was just a 
blind ?” 

Balston rose and gripped 
his shoulder. “Take the rest 
of the week off. A good 
rest — ” 

Ray shrugged out from un- 
der the other’s hand. “Oh, for 
God’s sake!” 

“You admit you’ve been 
scouting around looking for 
unusual things resulting from 
the so-called landing?” 

“So I’ve found them!” 

“ W^hat ? Scaly creatu res 
with gooseneck arms?” There 
was no laughter in Balston’s 
voice. But it was heavily im- 
plied. 

“What’ll you do when peo- 
ple start turning up miss- 
ing?” 

“We have never been a sen- 
sational newspaper,” the man- 
aging editor said, “and we 
don’t intend to create panic 
now. So don’t be difficult, 
Kirkland. Take a week off, 
then see how you feel.” 

H ands thrust dejectedly in 

his pockets, Ray trudged 
toward the parking lot. 
Ahead, a crowd jammed the 
sidewalk in front of a gaudily 
decorated department store 
that flew a festooned banner:

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



IS KOSTLEM AN KR AZ Y ? 

BIGGEST SAIL OF ALL! 

Lesser pennants advertis- 
ed : “21-Ounce Telavidco — 

$13.95!” “Combination Wash- 
er-Shaver — $13.66 !” “Bicycle 
— $2.19; Tricycle — $3.77; 
Quadricycle — $5.98 !” 

Drifting slowly up from 
the roof of the building were 
two of the almost indiscerni- 
ble patches of dark haze. A 
third was descending. Squint- 
ing, he located the speck of 
silver that hung steady over- 
head, almost lost in the blue. 

He pushed into the wedge 
that was pouring in through 
the main entrance. 

“Wait!” he shouted, arms 
upraised. “Don’t go in ! They’ll 
kill you!” 

The man pressing against 
him laughed. “You crazy? 
This is a publicity stunt.” 

“What won’t they think of 

next!” the woman next to 
him exclaimed, smiling. 

Abysmally, Ray thought of 
a vast formation of ducks fly- 
ing high over a blind occupied 
by a persistent caller . sev- 
eral of the hens wavering in 
flight, impatient to set down 
among the decoys . the irate 
lead drake seeing through the 
phony setup and quacking his 
alarm . the other birds ig- 
noring his warning and peel- 
ing off to plunge to the 
destruction that waited below. 

Caught up in the tide of 
eager bargain-seekers, he was 
swept into the store and de- 



posited in a long aisle where 
a young couple stood examin- 
ing a console television set. 
The man propped his elbow 
on top of the cabinet and his 
arm promptly plunged right 
through the paneling. Con- 
founded, he backed away. 

The buzzing sound of the 
transit was barely audible as 
man and wife vanished. 

B acking away fearfully, 

Ray saw the metal tube 
and its tripod — high on a shelf 
against the wall. To the left, 
flanking the next row, was an- 
other ; to the right, a third. 

The faint humming sounded 
again — and again — and again. 

He turned and bolted for the 
entrance. But the press of the 
crowd was too great, so he 
lunged for the back of the 
store. At the end of the aisle, 
he swerved to race along the 
wall looking for another exit. 
But he tripped over a carton 
and his impetus carried him 
lieadlong into the rear wall — 
through the wall — as easily as 
his fist had gone through the 
door of the Cape Cod! 

He regained his feet in a 
darkened room and stood star- 
ing terrified at a huge scaly 
thing like the one he had seen 
in the window of the beach 
house. A transit, its collapsed 
tripod gripped in the coil of a 
gooseneck arm, was slung over 
a protuberance that might 
have been a shoulder. Its other 
tendril was wrapped tightly 
around the necks of a lifeless 



SiniNG DUCK 



59 



man and three women who 
hung in a cluster. 

The thing tensed and faded 
into an almost indiscernible 
shadow, only the transit re- 
maining visible. Then the in- 
strument swung towai’d Ray. 

He lunged for the sidewall, 
diving through it as though it 
were made of papier-mache. 
The alley outside, however, 
was narrow and the force of 
his sprawling leap sent him 
crashing into the brick wall of 
the next building. 

Dazed, he rose shaking |iis 
head and staggered toward the 
sidewalk. But he pulled up 
sharply, cringing against the 
wall. Farther down the alley, 
an area of shadow seemed to 
be striving for materializa- 
tion. It drifted on toward 
him. 

He lurched out onto the side- 
walk and melted inconspic- 
uously into the stream of shop- 
pers. When he paused a block 
away to look back, there was 
no sign of the vague oval 
shadow. 

Then he thought suddenly of 
Alice and sprinted for the 
parking lot. God, they might 
throw up a booby trap any- 
where — even in his own 
neighborhood ! 

While racing home, his sus- 
picions were twice verified. 

. A man whose motions 
were too mechanical stood on 
the roof of a supennarket 
tossing down dollar bills; but 
the throng below was too pre- 
occupied to notice a wom- 



an on the veiy edge of the 
crowd vanish, a delivery boy 
go next. Closer to home, a 
theater which he was sure 
hadn’t been there two days 
earlier offered free admission 
for the first showing of “Mar- 
riln Monrow” in Bus Halt. 

H e jolted the car to a 

stop in the carport and 
swept in through the kitchen 
dooi'. 

His father-in-law sat at a 
table honing a hunting knife. 
“Home early today, ain’t you, 
son?” 

“Where’s Alice?” Ray asked 
frantically. 

The old man brushed three 
decoys out of the way to make 
more room for the sweep of 
Ills hand over the stone. “At 
the neighbor’s. You sup- 
pose we ought to spend Friday 
night at the lodge?” 

Ray hunched over the table. 
“Dad, how smart are ducks?” 
“Too danged smart some- 
times. Take that big canvas- 
back I shot down over the 
blind — ” 

“I mean do they ever get 
wise to our decoys, our 
blinds 

“Damned right.” His father- 
in-law ran a thumb delicately 
over the edge of the blade. 
“Some of ’em loiow what a 
gun means, too.” 

“Do they all go for a duck 
call?” 

“A good caller can fool any 
duck, no matter how smart it 
is.”

DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



“Alice!” Ray said in fright. 
“Dad, we’ve got to find her!” 

“Why so excited?” She step- 
ped in from the dining room 
and deposited a partly em- 
broidered tablecloth next to 
the decoys. 

He started for her, but the 
phone rang and he crossed 
over to the extension to an- 
swer it first. 

“For God’s sake, get the hell 
back here!” It was Ralston. 
“You were right. People are 
missing all over !” 

“I’m on my way.” Ray slam- 
med the received down and 
grabbed his hat. 

“Why so excited?” Alice 
asked again. 

“Don’t go outside!” he or- 
dered. “There’s no time to ex- 
plain. But stay in the house 
till you hear from me!” 

The old man followed him to 
the door. “Don’t get tied up 
this weekend. Tlie season starts 
Saturday, you know.” 

Ray paused, half in the car. 
“I’m afraid it’s already start- 
ed.” 

Alice’s strained voice float- 
ed after him. “Why so ex- 
cited ?” 

He was halfway down the 
drive when he tensed and jam- 
med on the brakes, realizing 
Alice had bogged down on the 
phrase “Why so excited?” — 
just as the woman-thing at the 
beach house had on her plea 
for help. 

Then he saw the patch of 
haze hovering ominously above 
the house, casting an even 



more tenuous shadow over his 
car. Pai’alyzed, he sat there 
gripping the wheel. 

Alice stumbled awkwardly 
out of the kitchen door. 
Through the windshield, he 
watched her turn clumsily to- 
ward him. She came forward 
in a halting stride — hut her 
feet weren’t even touching 
the pavement! 

HER SHOULDER struck a 
post of the carport and slie 
tottered momentarily, then 
keeled over, falling against 
the side of the house. One of 
her arms snapped off neatly 
along a shoulder seam and 
rolled grotesquely down the 
driveway. She lay on her side, 
her legs continuing to pump 
uninterrupted in their walk- 
ing motion, like an overturn- 
ed mechanical doll. 

Gears clashed as he sent 
the car lurching back into tlie 
street, then plunging forward 
toward the business district. 

The woman-thing at the 
beach-house hadn’t been a per- 
sonalized decoy, but this Alice- 
thing had. That could mean 
only that they were now after 
him specifically! 

Why? Because he had dis- 
covered their pattern of blinds 
and ruses? Because he had ex- 
posed it partially through the 
article on the Cape Cod? Had 
intruded and escaped at the 
beach house and again at the 
department store? 

Of course that was it! He 
had the knowledge to reveal 



SiniNG DUCK 6 } 



in detail what was happening. 
And unless they eliminated 
him — ^just as his father-in- 
law had eliminated the can- 
vasback that had discovered 
the blind — he could ruin their 
sport ! 

The whole concept was vast 
and appalling. Sportsmen 
from who only knew how far 
away, finding a spot teeming 
with what to them was only 
game, descending and setting 
up their blinds, preparing 
their decoys, perfecting their 
human calls . 

An oval shadow darkened 
the surface of the street be- 
hind him and he leaned out 
the window to glance up. The 
thing that had been over the 
house was following — over- 
taking him! 

The pressure was on him 
pei’sonally now, just as earlier 
it had been on the lead duck 
in the swamp! But there was 
a way he could escape! If he 
succeeded in alerting the flock 
— if he got his story in print 
and had the wire services pick 
it up and carry it all over — 
there would no longer be any 
point in eliminating him. And 
he would then have just as 
good a chance as the rest of 
the game! 

But the sjTnmetrical haze 
was already maneuvering in 
position over the car. 

He whipped the wheel 
around and careened into an 
alleyway, hurled the door open 
and dived out. He hit the as- 
phalt surface at a speed too 

62 



great for his legs to take and 
tumbled over, rolling into the 
recessed freight entrance of 
the building on the left. 

The shadow clouded the al- 
ley as his car crashed into the 
other building. Then the car 
vanished and the shadow 
went away. 

Minutes later, after the pain 
had subsided in the abrasion 
burns along his forearm and 
thigh, he crept out to the 
street and continued groggily 
toward the newspaper office. 
He was fighting mad. 

ALSTON looked up impa- 
tiently as he entered the 
news room. “For God’s sake! 
Get it down on paper — 
quick!” 

At his desk, Ray sat mo- 
tionless for a moment, arrang- 
ing his mental notes before 
beginning the story. He stared 
around the room. No shad- 
ows — not yet, at least. 

Hawkins was hunched over 
his desk reading copy. Two re- 
porters were busy taking calls 
over the telephone. The stac- 
cato of the clacking keys in 
the glass-enclosed teletype 
room was a muffled distrac- 
tion that plucked annoyingly 
at his concentration. 

Finally the lead of the story 
began taking form in his 
mind and he squared away in 
front of the typewriter. 

“Get it down on paper — 
quick!” Balston broke in im- 
patiently on his thoughts. 

He ran a sheet of paper 




DANIEL F. GALOUYE 



through the roller and began 
knocking out the story. 

“For God’s sake! Get it 
down on paper — quick!” 

Ray froze with his hands 
poised above the keyboard. 
He pivoted slowly toward 
Ralston. From his position, he 
could see behind the manag- 
ing editor’s desk . 

Ralston existed from the 
waist up only. From there 
down, a slim pedestal held him 
upright. 

And the shadows were in 
the news room. He could see 
them now — one in the far cor- 
ner close to the ceiling, anoth- 
er behind the glass in the 
teletype room, a third hov- 



ering bobind the immobile 
Hawkins at the city desk. 

And the transits were there 
too — one half hidden in back 
of the water cooler, the tube 
of another pi'otruding from 
behind the copy desk, still an- 
other poking out above Hawk- 
ins’ shoulder. They all swung 
around slowly, carefully fo- 
cusing on him. 

None of the other blinds 
had worked, he realized, and 
remembered what his father- 
in-law had said : “A good call- 
er can fool any duck, no mat- 
ter how smart it is.” And then 
he heard the first note of the 
high-pitched whine. 

END 



STAVING OFF MALTHUS 

With world population exploding unthinkably faster than even the grim- 
mest Malthusian ever predicted, threatening to double within the life- 
t’mes of many now living, the threat of woi-ld hunger dominates the 
thinking of responsible leaders — and challenges scientists into producing 
solutions at an equally unthinkable rate: 

• Mechanized farming — in a decade and a half since 1945, farmers have 
installed 1200% more machinery, most of it unthought of before World 
War II. Half our total farm pi'oduction is done by only slightly more 
tiian 10% of the total number of producers, and if the trend toward giant 
fai-ms continues, the other 90% could combine to increase their output 
tenfold. 

• Chemical fanning — use of fertilizer has inci'easod fourfold, from a 
million and a half to over six million tons, with yield growing to more 
than double the investment. Antibiotics, hormones and scientific feeding 
put weight on animals and fowl at a totally unprecedented rate, making 
them ready for market heavier, tenderer and at less cost per pound — 
\\dthin five years, a three-pound chicken will be possible in only six weeks, 
a fully grown steei' in only a few months. 

• Genetics — by intensive hybridization, hardier and more quickly matur- 
ing and better-bearing plants, trees, vegetables, fruits and animals are 
constantly being manufactured by biological engineei’ing, enabling areas 
to produce fax*ther north and south, and in di 7 or overmoist places, than 
had been thought possible only a decade ago. 

• Farming the sea — schools of fish are now spotted by sonar, soon will 
be herded like cattle, fed like poultry; shellfish are planted and forced, 
protected by underwater fences; seaw'eed is grown and harvested in- 
tensively.

AGING, Trooper

feet above Tammany Square. 

The cool cybrain surgicall\ 
implanted in him was work- 
ing on the problem. But Lane 
had no more patience. They’d 
sweat, he thought, hating the 
chill air-currents 
his hovering

and that. He glared down at 
the three towers bordering on 
the Square. He spat, and 
watched the little white speck 
fall, fall. Lock me up in bar- 
racks. All I wanted was a 
little time off. Did I fight in 
Chi for them? Damn right I 
did. Just a little time off, so 
I shouldn’t blow my top. Noio 
the lid’s gone. 

He was going over all their 
heads. He’d bowled those city 
cops over like paper dolls, 
back at the Armory. The 
black dog was on Lane’s back. 
Old Mayor himself was going 
to hear about it. 

Why not? Ain’t old Mayor 
the CinC of the Netvyork 
Troopers? 

The humming paragrav- 
paks embedded beneath his 
shoulder blades held him 
motionless above Newyork’s 
three administrative towers. 
Tammany Hall. Mayor’s Pal- 
ace. Court House. Lane cursed 
his stupidity. He hadn’t found 
out which one was which 
ahead of time. They keep 
Troopers in the Armory and 
teach them hoiv to fight. They 
don’t teach them about their 
own city, that they’ll be fight- 
ing for. There’s no time. From 
seven years old up, Troopers 
have too much to learn about 
fighting. 

The Mayor was behind one 
of those thousands of win- 
dows. 

Old cybrain, a gift from the 
Trooper surgeons, compli- 
ments of the city, would have 



to figure out which one. Blood 
churned in his veins, nerves 
shrieked with impatience. 
Lane waited for the electronic 
brain to come up with the an- 
swer. 

Then his head jerked up, to 
a distant buzz. There were 
cops coming. Two black para- 
grav-boats whiri’ed along the 
translucent underside of New- 
york’s anti-missile force- 
shield, the Shell. 

Old cybrain better be fast. 
Damn fast! 

The cybrain jolted an im- 
pulse through his spine. Lane 
somersaulted. Cybrain had 
taken charge of his motor 
nerves. Lane’s own mind was 
just along for the ride. 

1'TIS body snapped into a 
Jn stiff dive position. He be- 
gan to plummet down, picking 
up speed. His mailed hands 
glittered like arrowheads out 
in front. They pointed to a 
particular window in one of 
the towers. A predatory ex- 
citement rippled through him 
as he sailed down through the 
air. It was like going into 
battle again. A little rtd- 
white-and-green flag fluttered 
on a staff below the window. 
Whose flag? The city flag was 
orange and blue. He shrugged 
away the problem. Cybrain 
knew what it was doing. 

The little finger of his right 
hand vibrated in its metal 
sheath. A pale vibray leaped 
from the lensed fingertip. 
Breakthrough ! The glasstic 



65 



pane dissolved. Lane streamed 
through the window. 

The paragrav-paks cut off. 
Lane dropped lightly to the 
floor, inside the room, in battle 
crouch. A 3V set was yammer- 
ing. A girl screamed. Lane’s 
hand shot out automatically. 
A finger vibrated. Out of the 
corner of his eye. Lane saw 
the girl fold to the floor. There 
was no one else in the room. 
Lane, still in a crouch, chewed 
his lip. 

The Mayor? 

His head swung around and 
he peered at the 3V set. He 
saw his own face. 

“Lashing police with his 
vibray," said the announcer, 
“Lane broke through the cor- 
don surrounding Manhattan 
Armory. Two policemen were 
killed, four others seriously 
injured. Tammany Hall has 
warned that this man is ex- 
tremely dangerous. Citizens 
are cautioned to keep clear of 
him. Lane is an insane killer. 
He is armed with the latest 
military weapons. A built-in 
electronic brain controls his 
reflexes — ” 

“At ease with that jazz,” 
said Lane, and a sheathed fin- 
ger snapped out. There was a 
loud bang. The 3V screen dis- 
solved into a puddle of glass- 
tic. 

The Mayor. 

Lane strode to the window. 
The two police boats were 
hovering above the towers. 
Lane’s mailed hand snapped 
open a pouch at his belt. He 



flipped a fist-sized cube to the 
floor. 

The force-bomb “exploded” 
— swelled or inflated, really, 
but with the speed of a blast. 
Lane glanced out the window. 
A section of the energy globe 
bellied out from above. It 
shaded the view from his win- 
dow and re-entered the tower 
wall just below. 

Now the girl. 

He turned back to the room. 
“Wake up, outa-towner. ” He 
gave the blonde girl a light 
dose of the vibray to slap her 
awake. 

“Who are you?” she said, 

shakily. 

Lane grinned. “Trooper 
Lane, of the Newyork Special 
Troops, is all.” He threw her 
a mock salute. “You from 
outa-town, girlie. I ain’t seen 
a Newyork girl with yellow 
hair in years. Orange or 
green is the action. Whatcha 
doing in the Mayor’s room?” 

T he girl pushed herself to 
her feet. Built, Lane saw. 
She was pretty and clean-look- 
ing, very out-of-town. She 
held herself straight and her 
blue-violet eyes snapped at 
him. 

“What the devil do you 
think you’re doing, soldier? I 
am a diplomat of the Grass- 
roots Republic of Mars. This 
is an embassy, if you know 
what that means.” 

“I don’t,” said Lane, uncon- 
cerned. 

“Well, you should have had 

ROBERT J. SHEA 



66 



brains enough to honor the 
flag outside this window. 
That’s the Martian flag, sol- 
dier. If you’ve never heard of 
diplomatic immunity, you’ll 
suffer for your ignorance.” 
Her large, dark eyes nar- 
rowed. “Who sent you?” 

“My cy brain sent me.” 

She went openmouthed. 
“You’re Lane” 

“I’m the guy they told you 
about on the 3V. Where’s the 
Mayor? Ain’t this his place?” 
“No. No, you’re in the 
wrong room. The wrong build- 
ing. That’s the Mayor’s suite 
over there.” She pointed. “See 
where the balcony is? This is 
the Embassy suite. If you 
want the Mayor you’ll have to 
go over there.” 

“Whaddaya know,” said 
Lane. “Cybrain didn’t know, 
no more than me.” 

The girl noticed the dark 
swell of the force-globe. 
“What’s that out there?” 
“Force-screen. Nothing gets 
past, except maybe a full-size 
blaster-beam. Keeps cops out. 
Keeps you in. You anybody 
important?” 

“I told you. I’m an ambas- 
sador. From Mars. I’m on a 
diplomatic mission.” 

“Yeah? Mars a big city?” 
She stared at him, violet 
eyes wide. “The planet Mars.” 
“Planet? Oh, that Mars. 
Sure, I’ve heard of it — you 
gotta go by spaceship. What’s 
your name?” 

“Gerri Kin. Look, Lane, 
holding me is no good. It’ll 



just get you in worse trouble. 
What are you trying to do?” 

‘T wanna see the Mayor. Me 
and my buddies, we just come 
back from fighting in Chi, 
Gerri. We won. They got a 
new Mayor out there in Chi. 
He takes orders from New- 
york. ” 

Gerri Kin said, “That’s 
what the force-domes did. The 
perfect defense. But also the 
road to the return to city- 
states. Anarchy.” 

Lane said, “Yeah? Well, we 
done what they wanted us to 
do. We did the fighting for 
them. So we come back home 
to Newyork and they lock us 
up in the Armory. Won’t pay 
us. Won’t let us go nowhere. 
They had cops guarding us. 
City cops.” Lane sneered. “I 
busted out. I wanna see the 
Mayor and find out why we 
can’t have time off. I don’t 
play games, Gerri. I go right 
to the top.” 

Lane broke off. There was 
a hum outside the window. He 
whirled and stared out. The 
rounded black hulls of the two 
police paragrav-boats were 
nosing toward the force- 
screen. Lane could read the 
white numbers painted on 
their bows. 

A loudspeaker shouted into 
the room : “Come out of there. 
Lane, or we’ll blast you out.” 

“You can't,” Lane called. 
“This girl from Mars is here.” 

“I repeat. Lane — come out 
or we’ll blast you out.” 

Lane turned to the girl. “I 

67 



MUTINEER 



thought you were impor- 
tant. ” 

QHE stood there with her 
^ hands together, calmly 
looking at him. “I am. But 
you are too, to them. Mars is 
millions of miles away, and 
you’re right across the Square 
from the Mayor’s suite.” 

“Yeah, but — ” Lane shook 
his head and turned back to 
the window. “All right, look! 
Move them boats away and 
I’ll let this girl out!” 

“No deal, Lane. We’re com- 
ing in.” The police boats 
backed away slowly, then shot 
straight up, out of the line of 
vision. 

Lane looked down at the 
Square. Far below, the long, 
gleaming barrel of a blaster 
cannon caught the dim light 
filtering down through New- 
york’s Shell. The cannon trun- 
dled into the Square on its 
olive-drab, box-shaped cater- 
pillar mounting and took up a 
position equidistant from the 
bases of the three towers. 

Now a rumble of many 
voices rose from below. Lane 
stared down to see a large 
crowd gathering in Tammany 
Square. Sound trucks were 
rolling to a stop around the 
edges of the crowd. The peo- 
ple were all looking up. 

Lane looked across the 
Square. The windows of the 
tower opposite, the ones he 
could see clearly, were crowd- 
ed with faces. There were 
white dot faces on the balcony 



that Gerri Kin had pointed 
out as the Mayor’s suite. 

The voice of a 3V newscas- 
ter rolled up from the Square, 
reechoing against the tower 
walls. 

“Lane is holding the Mar- 
tian Ambassador, Gerri Kin, 
hostage. You can see the Mar- 
tian tricolor behind his force- 
globe. Police are bringing up 
blaster cannon. Lane's de- 
fense is a globe of energy 
similar to the one which pro- 
tects Newyork from aerial at- 
tack. ” 

Lane grinned back at Gerri 
Kin. “Whole town’s do^^’^l 
there.” Then his grin faded. 
Nice-looking, nice-talking girl 
like this probably cared a lot 
more about dying than he did. 
Why the hell didn’t they give 
him a chance to let her out? 
Maybe he could do it now. 

Cybrian said no. It said the 
second he dropped his force- 
screen, they’d blast this room 
to hell. Poor girl from Mars, 
she didn’t have a chance. 

Gerri Kin put her hand to 
her forehead. “Why did you 
have to pick my room? Why 
did they send me to this crazy 
city? Private soldiers. Twen- 
ty million people living under 
a Shell like worms in a corpse. 
Earth is sick and it’s going to 
kill me. What’s going to hap- 
pen?” 

Lane looked sadly at her. 
Only two kinds of girls ever 
went near a Trooper — the 
crazy ones and the ones the 
city paid. Why did he have to 



68 



ROBERT J. SHEA 



be so near getting killed when 
he met one he liked? Now that 
she was showing a little less 
fear and anger, she was talk- 
ing straight to him. She was 
good, but she wasn’t acting as 
if she was too good for him. 

“They’ll start shooting pret- 
ty quick,” said Lane. “I’m 
sorry about you.” 

“I wish I could write a let- 
ter to my parents,” she said. 
“What?” 

“Didn’t you understand 
what I said?” 

“What’s a letter?” 

“You don’t know where 
Mars is. You don’t know what 
a letter is. You probably can’t 
even read and write!” 

L ane shrugged. He carried 
on the conversation disin- 
terestedly, professionally re- 
laxed before battle. “What’s 
these things I can’t do? They 
important?” 

“Yes. The more I see of this 
city and its people, the more 
important I realize they are. 
You know how to light, don’t 
you? I’ll bet you’re perfect 
with those weapons.” 

“Listen. They been training 
me to fight since I was a little 
kid. Why shouldn’t I be a 
great little fighter?” 

“Specialization,” said the 
girl from Mars. 

“What?” 

“Specialization. Everyone 
I’ve met in this city is a spe- 
cialist. SocioSpecs run the 
government. TechnoSpecs run 
the machinery. Troopers fight 



the wars. And ninety per cent 
of the people don’t work at all 
because they’re not trained to 
do anything.” 

“The Fans,” said Lane. 
“They got it soft. That’s them 
down there, come to watch the 
fight. ” 

“You know why you were 
kept in the Armory, Lane? I 
heard them talking about it, 
at the dinner I went to last 
night.” 

“Why?” 

“Because they’re afraid of 
the Troopers. You men did too 
good a job out in Chi. You are 
the deadliest weapon that has 
ever been made. You. Single 
airborne infantrymen!” 

Lane said, “Thej- told us in 
Trooper Academy that it’s the 
men that win the wars.” 

“Yes, but people had forgot- 
ten it until the SocioSpecs of 

Newyork came up with the 
Troopers. Before the Troop- 
ers, governments concentrat- 
ed on the big weapons, the 
missiles, the bombs. And the 
cities, with the Shells, were 
safe from bombs. They learn- 
ed to be self-sufficient under 
the Shells. They were so safe, 
so isolated, that national gov- 
ernments collapsed. But you 
Troopers wiped out that feel- 
ing of security, when you in- 
filtrated Chi and conquered 
it.” 

“We scared them, huh?” 

Gerri said, “You scared 
them so much that they were 
afraid to let you have a fur- 
lough in the city when you 



I 

« 



MUTINEER

came back. Afraid you Troop- 
ers would realize that you 
could easily take over the city 
if you wanted to. You scared 
them so much that they’ll let 
me be killed. They’ll actually 
risk trouble with Mars just to 
kill you.” 

“I’m sorry about you. I 
mean it, I like — ” 

At that moment a titanic, 

ear-splitting explosion hurled 
him to the carpet, deafened 
and blinded him. 

He recovered and saw Gerri 
a few feet away, dazed, grop- 
ing on hands and knees. 

Lane jumped to the win- 
dow, looked quickly, sprang 
back. Cybrain pumped orders 
to his nervous system. 

“Blaster cannon,” he said. 
“But just one. Gotcha, cy- 
brain. I can beat that.” 

He picked up the black box 
that generated his protective 
screen. Snapping it open with 
thumb-pressure, he turned a 
small dial. Then he waited. 

Again an enormous, brain- 
shattering concussion. 

Again Lane and Gerri were 
thrown to the floor. But this 
time there was a second ex- 
plosion and a blinding flash 
from below. 

Lane laughed boyishly and 
ran to the window. 

“Look!” he called to Gerri. 

T here was a huge gap in 
the crowd below. The 
pavement was blackened and 
shattered to rubble. In and 
around the open space 



sprawled dozens of tiny black 
figures, not moving. 

“Backfire,” said Lane. “I set 

the screen to throw their 
blaster beam right back at 
them.” 

“And they knew you might 
— and yet they let a crowd 
congregate ! ” 

Gerri reeled away from the 
window, sick. 

Lane said, “I can do that a 
couple times more, but it 
burns out the force-globe. 
Then I’m dead.” 

He heard the 3V newscas- 
ter’s amplified voice: “ — ap- 
proximately fifty killed. But 
Lane is through now. He has 
been able to outthink police 
with the help of his cybrain. 
Now police are feeding the 
problem to their giant ana- 
logue computer in the sub- 
basement of the Court House. 
The police analogue computer 
will be able to outthink Lane’s 
cybrain, will predict Lane’s 
moves in advance. Four more 
blaster cannon are coming 
down Broadway — ” 

“Why don’t they clear those 
people out of the Square?” 
Gerri cried. 

“What? Oh, the Fans — no- 
body clears them out.” He 
paused. “I got qne more 
chance to try.” He raised a 
mailed glove to his mouth and 
pressed a small stud in the 
wrist. He said, “Trooper HQ, 
this is Lane.” 

A voice spoke in his hel- 
met. “Lane, this is Trooper 
HQ. We figured you’d call.”

“Get me Colonel Klett.” 
Thirty seconds passed. Lane 
could hear the clank of cater- 
pillar treads as the mobile 
blaster cannon rolled into 
Tammany Square. 

The voice of the command- 
ing officer of the Troopers 
rasped into Lane’s ear : 
“Meat-head! You broke out 
against my orders! Now look 
at you!” 

“I knew you didn’t mean 
them orders, sir.” 

“If you get out of there 
alive, I’ll hang you for dis- 
obeying them!” 

“Yes, sir. Sir, there’s a girl 
here — somebody important — 
from Mars. You know, the 
planet. Sir, she told me we 
could take over the city if we 
got loose. That right, sir?” 
There was a pause. “Your 
girl from Mars is right. Lane. 
But it’s too late now. If we 
had moved first, captured the 
city government, we might 
have done it. But they’re 
ready for us. They’d chop us 
down with blaster cannon.” 
“Sir, I’m asking for help. I 
know you’re on my side.” 

“I am. Lane.” The voice of 
Colonel Klett was lower. “I’d 
never admit it if you had a 
chance of getting out of there 
alive. You’ve had it, son. I’d 
only lose more men trying to 
rescue you. When they feed 
the data into that analogue 
computer, you’re finished.” 
“Yes, sir.” 

“I’m sorry. Lane.” 

“Yes, sir. Over and out.” 



Lane pressed the stud on 
his gauntlet again. He turned 
to Gerri. 

“You’re okay. I wish I 
could let you out. Old cybrain 
says I can’t. Says if I drop tJie 
force-globe for a second, 
they’ll fire into the room, and 
then we’ll both be dead.” 

G erri stood with folded 
arms and looked at him. 
“Do what you have to do. As 
far as I can see, you’re the 
only person in this city that 
has even a little bit of right 
on his side,” 

Lane laughed. “Any of them 
purple-haired broads I know 
would be crazy scared. You’re 
different.” 

“When my grandparents 
landed on Mars, they found 
out that selfishness was a lux- 
ury. Martians can’t afford 
it.” 

Lane frowned with the ef- 
fort of thinking. “You said I 
had a little right on my side. 
That’s a good feeling. Nobody 
ever told me to feel that way 
about myself before. It’ll be 
better to die knowing that.” 

“I know,” she said. 

The amplified voice from 
below said, “The police ana- 
logue computer is now hooked 
directly to the controls of the 
blaster cannon battery. It will 
outguess Lane’s cybrain and 
check his moves ahead of 
time.” 

Lane looked at Gerri. “How 
about giving me a kiss before 
they get us? Be nice if I kiss- 

71 



MUTINEER 



ed a girl like you just once in 
my life.” 

She smiled and walked for- 
ward. “You deserve it, Lane.” 
He kissed her and it filled 
him with longings for things 
he couldn’t name. Then he 
stepped back and shook his 
head. “It ain’t right you 
should get killed. If I take a 
dive out that window, they 
shoot at me, not in here,” 
“And kill you all the soon- 
er.” 

“Better than getting burned 
up in this lousy little room. 
You also got right on your 
side. There’s too many damn 
Troopers and not enough good 
persons like you. Old cybrain 
says stay here, but I don’t 
guess I will. I’m gonna pay 
vou back for that kiss.” 

A 

“But you’re safe in here!” 
“Worry about yourself, not 
about me.” Lane picked up the 
force-bomb and handed it to 
her. “When I say now, press 
this. Then take your hand off, 
real fast. It’ll shut off the 
screen for a second.” 

He stepped up on to the 
window ledge. Automatically, 
the cybrain cut in his para- 
grav-paks. “So long, outa- 
towner. Now!” 

He jumped. He was hurtling 
across the Square when the 
blaster cannons opened up. 
They weren’t aimed at the 
window where the little red- 
white-and-green tricolor was 
flying. But they weren’t aim- 
ed at Lane, either. They were 
shooting wild. 



Which way now? Looks 
like I got a chance. Old cy- 
brain says fly Hght for the 
caiinons. 

He saw the Mayor’s balcony 
ahead. Go to hell, old cyhmin. 
Pm doing all right by myself. 
I come to see the Mayor, and 
Pm gonna see him. 

Lane plunged forward. He 
heard the shouts of frightened 
men. 

He swooped over the bal- 
cony railing. A man was 
pointing a blaster pistol at 
him. There were five men 
on the balcony — emergency ! 
Years of training and cybrain 
took over. Lane’s hand shot 
out, fingers vibrating. As he 
dropped to the balcony floor in 
battle-crouch, the men slump- 
ed around him. 

He had seen the man with 
the blaster pistol before. It 
was the Mayor of Newyork. 

Lane stood for a moment in 
the midst of the sprawled 
men, the shrieks of the crowd 
floating up to him. Then he 
raised his glove to his lips. He 
made contact with Manhattan 
Armory. 

“Colonel Klett, sir. You 
said if we captured the city 
government we might have a 
chance. Well, I captured the 
city government. What do we 

do with it now?” 

L ane was uncomfortable in 
his dress uniform. First 
there had been a ceremony in 
Tammany Square inaugurat- 
ing Newyork’s new Military 



72 



ROBERT J. SHEA 



Protectorate, and honoring 
Trooper Lane. Now there was 
a foiTnal dinner. Colonel Klett 
and Gerri Kin sat on either 
side of Lane. 

Klett said, “Call me an op- 
portunist if you like. Miss 
Kin, my government will be 
stable, and Mars can negotiate 
with it.” He was a lean, sharp- 
featured man with deep 
grooves in his face, and gray 
hair. 

Gerri shook her head. “Rec- 
ognition for a new govern- 
ment takes time. Fm going 
back to Mars, and I think 
they’ll send another ambassa- 
dor next time. Nothing per- 
sonal — I just don’t like it 
here.” 

Lane said, “Fm going to 
Mars, too.” 

“Did she ask you to?” de- 
manded Klett. 

Lane shook his head. “She’s 
got too much class for me. But 
I like what she told me about 
Mars. It’s healthy, like.” 

Klett frowned. “If I thought 
there was a gram of talent in- 
volved in your capture of the 
Mayor, Lane, I’d never re- 
lease you from duty. But I 



know better. You beat that 
analogue computer by sheer 
stupidity — by disregarding 
your cybrain.” 

Lane said, “It wasn’t so stu- 
pid if it worked.” 

“That’s what bothers me. It 
calls for a revision in our tac- 
tics. We’ve got a way of beat- 
ing those big computers now, 
should anyone use them 
against us.” 

“I just didn’t want her to 
be hurt.” 

“Exactly. The computer 
could outguess a machine, like 
your cybrain. But you intro- 
duced a totally unpredic- 
table factor — human emotion. 
Which proves what I, as a 
military man, have always 
maintained — that the dead- 
liest weapon in man’s arsenal 
is still, and will always be, the 
individual soldier.” 

“What you just said there, 
sir,” said Lane. “That’s why 
I’m leaving Newyork.” 

“What do you mean?” ask- 
ed Colonel Klett. 

“Fm tired of being a weap- 
on, sir. I want to be a human 
being.”

] ■ REMEMBER when I was 
- a boy the weather was 
better. No, really. All the 
rain showers from condensa- 
tion of somebody’s air condi- 
tioner, and the terrible cold 
winters because the heat is 
sucked in from out, and the 
frantic purple sunsets one 
night after another — ^who 
needs a spectacle every night? 
And why should there be so 
much dust from H-tests to 
make them? 

All these things weren’t. It 
was simple and nice, the 
world of my youth. Now it is 



74 



not so nice, but I’m living, so 
I won’t complain. 

Today was like every day. 

Do you understand what 
this means? Get up, smile like

bows his way ahead of you to

full and the hot water has just 
run out, eat, dress, work, eat, 
work again, eat again . and 
I have now used that word 
“eat” three times and each 
time, I tell you, it was a lie. 
Because what is eating when

was more comfortable and 
more interesting to be alive. 

Oh, positively it was not as 
efficient. For whoever keeps 
score, it is clear tliat the pres- 
ent way produces more units 
of “living” with a lower cost 
in raw-material-factor and 

work-energy-factor. 

Of course. 

It is definite that more 
“living” can be done if the 
quality is lowered, you see; 
and I could discuss this at 
length. 

I won’t, because it is too 
personally painful. I once 
fought for wage-hour legisla- 
tion and the guaranteed an- 
nual income, and to contem- 
plate such innocence even at 
the distance of nearly a cen- 
tury is too sad for me to dis- 
cuss, even not at length. 



S O WHAT was it that I had 
to look forward to, after 
my battle with the bath queue, 
the breakfast queue, the sub- 
way queue, the time-clock 
queue, the lunch queue, the 
coffee-break queue, the re- 
turning subway queue, the 
dinner queue, the latrine 
queue, the pillow-and-sheet 
queue? After all this, what 
orgiastic pleasures to cap my 
day? I’ll tell you what orgias- 
tic pleasures. After all that, it 
was permitted that I spend 
two solid hours in my bunk, 
watching television. 

A hundred years ago, why, 
I could have done almost any- 
thing. I could have gone for a 
walk in the park. (A “park” 
is a place in a city that has 
trees and grass. “Trees” are 
like grass, only bigger. To 
“walk” means to go some- 
where — on foot, that is, not on 
the subwa,y. Once it was done 
for pleasure, but that was 
when somewhere else was dif- 
ferent than where you already 

were. ) 

Or I could have played 
cards. (“Cards” are a game 
played among friends, some- 
times for gambling although 
the principal object is the 
friendly passage of time. A 
“game” is — like the panel 
shows on TV, do you see ? And 
“friends” are persons whose 
interests are close enough to 
make them want to spend time 
with each other.) 

Or I could have taken a 
drive to the beach. (A “beach” 



75 



is — oh, this is all too tragic.) 

No, you do not understand, 
you cannot understand. Let 
>ne tell you about one particu- 
lar day and let that answer 
everjd;hing. 

There was this sweet, sweet 
morning in June. It was Sun- 
day, which meant that by the 
grace of God I didn’t have to 
work in the jewelry findings 
business and could do what I 
liked. Now this will interest 
you : On that particular morn- 
ing I got up out of a bed that 
no one ever slept in but me. 
(We were very poor, a con- 
cept which I cannot explain 
without fantastic trouble since 
the concept of poverty has dis- 
appeared from the Earth. But 
I must mention this, to — to 
please myself is why. In that 
day, when I was very, very 
poor, I had a bed of my very 
own.) 

And once up, I took all the 
time I wanted in the bathroom 
— subject only to the natural 
requirements of four brothers 
and a sister. Maybe there 
were cockroaches sometimes 
in the wet place under the 
linoleum, but there were no 
coin slots on any of the equip- 
ment. 

I then ate breakfast. 

Breakfast! It began with a 
glass of orange juice. Two 
pieces of shredded wheat 
(this would be familiar to 
you, I regret to state; you 
would hardly think it strange 
at all if tomorrow it should 
turn up in the Adult Ration 



at Midtown Serving Cen- 
ter.) But on the shredded 
wheat was real milk. And real 
sugar. And usually ( I was the 
oldest son, you see) a large 
spoonful of strawberry jam, 
made out of real strawberries. 

All this I ate. Sometimes I 
did not finish it. And then, 1 
swear, what was not eaten 
was thrown away. Fabulous! 
It was never reprocessed and 
served again, never! 

However, I did not appre- 
ciate this treasurehouse of 
marvels which was mine to 
live in, at (I still remember!) 
2783 East 22nd Street, Brook- 
lyn. On the morning of which 
I tell you I got out of there. I 
went to see my friend Saul. 

T O SEE my friend Saul, 
that is a journey which 
cannot be duplicated any 
more. It was necessary to take 
a bus, and transfer to another 
bus, and then a ferry, and 
then another bus ; it took two 
hours, but what else is a Sun- 
day morning for? And I did 
not begrudge it to him, not on 
week ends in the summer. But 
when I got there, he was down 
in the cellar, of course. I drag- 
ged him by the shoulders and 
showed him that there was a 
sun. 

“Interesting,” he said, 
scratching his jaw, “and a 
very difficult astrogational 
problem. Why, the gravity 
field in the vicinity of the sun 
is nothing less than astro- 
nomical!”

PAUL FLEHR 



“I Avas showing it to you,” 

I told him, “not so much as a 
problem in space travel as an 
object of art.” 

He looked at me as though 
I had turned purple. 

I accepted what I could not 
fight. “Tell me then, Saul, 
what are you working on?” I ' 
asked, hiding behind me my 
bathing suit in its paper bag. 

He told me, that fine boy. 
He told me with words until 
I must indeed have turned 
purple, and then he dragged 
me to a blackboard and 
showed me some more. What 
did I know? He knew what he 
was talking about, I was sure. 

“Space travel?” I asked. 

He nodded happily. You 
would have thought 1 was a 
big genius like a Baruch. 

“But what about rocket 
ships?” I asked him. 

Saul looked at me as though 
Baruch had just turned into 
an ape. 

“No, not in rocket ships, 
Charlie McCarthy,” he told 
me with savage affection, “but 
by the power of the mind.” 
And he tapped his skull with 
a bent finger. 

S AUL lived in Rockaway, 
where his mother owned a 
colony of beach bungalows. 
You would have understood 
these houses, with “rooms” 
that were only partitions, 
head high, with walls that 
were made of thin shingles 
and floors that were perma- 
nently washed with a little of 



sand from the beach. Outside 
each cottage was a shower — 
hot water, or hot enough, be- 
cause the bare pipes soaked in 
heat from the sun. Just like 
the baths at the Midtown 
Adult Dormitories, do you 

see? 

If you were first in line, 
you got hot water. But of 
course you were never first in 
line. Because each of those 
four-room bungaloAvs held 
tliree families — the mommy, 
the kids and on weelc ends 
the daddy — clubbing up to 
save expenses. 

But ^ul had a cellar. He 
lived tliere all year round, in 
winter when the snow was 
unbroken from his door to the 
high-water line on the sand, 
and no other human moved in 
sight ; and also in the summer. 
This was summer, you see. 1 
had my bathing suit with me. 
It was not because I liked so 
well to swim — who needs to 
swim? But outside that cellai 
of Saul’s, in the streets, on 
the boardwalk, on the beach, 
were thousands and thousands 
of persons, one-half of whom 
were female. They were dress- 
ed for the sun. 

And Saul puttered in his 
cellar ! 

“Come, Saul,” I said gently. 
“Go to Mars some other time. 
Invent a method of flying to 
the Moon when winter comes. 
Now put on a bathing suit and 
come with me.” 

And I took him out to show 
him Girls. 



A LIFE AND A/HAIF 



77 



U p IN the morning, work, 
eat, work. I’m a 664.818- 
A, and all my days are reading 
and reading. From Shake- 
speare, Mallarme, and the 
orose-poems of Kahlil Gibran^ 
it is my task to extract the es- 
sential truth, the bare state- 
ment of fact, which alone 
deserves the space to be re- 
tained. (The other day I 
reduced Moby Dick to “Nine- 
teenth-century knowledge of 
cetaceans was inexact.”) And 
the secret which I clutch to my 
bosom is that even that job is 
of no real importance; it is 
like raking leaves for the 
W.P.A., a metaphor which I 
have not the youth to untangle 
for you. 

For once I met another 
664.8 18- A in the laundry 
queue, an old crone, a step- 
dame or a dowager, long 
withering out the waiting for 
my shirts. We compared 
notes. 

She had done Christo- 
pher Marlowe the month be- 
fore, and I had been assigned 
him for my next ; she did the 
Beau Geste books of Percival 
Christopher Wren, and I had 
done them early the previous 
year. 

I gloated secretly over her, 
for she had got only that 
“cafard” was a Legionnaire’s 
term for desert insanity from 
Wren, missing entirely the 
important observation that 
socks breed foot blisters. 

Then I gloated no longer. It 
had been barely possible to 

78 



pretend the job was useful 
when I thought I alone did it, 
but ttvo of us? And where 
there were two there were 
more. And I wondered just 
what the file clerks did with 
my neatly lettered green slips 
headed : Synoptic Analysis of 
Essential Information Con- 
tent of .. {Fill in Title and 
Author). They made binaiy 
digits of it all somehow, I sup- 
pose. But what then? 

So I concealed the vixen in 
my shirtfront and chatted 
with her of other things. She 
had drawn an April, 2037 slot 
on the Mars colonization rock- 
et. I certainly hope she lived 
to make it. 

My own emigration date is 
October of 2071. Since this 
will require attaining an age 
of more than a hundred and 
fifty years, I am not wildly 
hopeful. 

I can therefore look for- 
ward to a good many addi- 
tional mornings of wake, 
dress, eat, work, eat ... to 
spinach Jello. I suppose it is 
better in the colonies, or else 
we wouldn’t all be so anxious 
to get there. Certainly it is 
less crowded. That’s the trou- 
ble with atomic rockets, and 
of course I blame it all on my 
friend Saul. 

I can tell you a story. 

Once there was a very rich 
man who took a poor man into 
his house. The poor man, 
whose name was Ittel, ate at 
the rich man’s table, slept in 
a good warm bed, wore the 



PAUL FLEHR 



rich man’s clothes. One night 
the rich man was about to eat 
when Ittel stopped him. 

“Stop,” he cried, “don’t 

eat ! ” 

“Don’t eat?” repeated the 
rich man, puzzled. 

“Don’t eat,” cried Ittel, and 
he jumped up fix)m his place 
at the table and rushed over 
to the rich man’s seat. “You 
call that salt?” he scolded, and 
put more salt on the rich 
man’s food. 

“But I don’t like so much 
salt,” objected the rich man, 
“and besides it’s bad for my 
heart.” 

“Heart!” scoffed Ittel. “En- 
joy your food!” And he 
dumped the silver salt dish on 
the rich man’s meat. “You call 
that pepper?” he demanded, 
and dumped on the pepper, 
too. “You call that garlic?” 
And he chopped up a whole 
clove of garlic and put that 
on, too. 

“But I’m not well, Ittel,” 
the rich man complained. “My 
doctor says — ” 

“Doctor, schmoctor,” order- 
ed Ittel, “you paid for this 
salt, right? You paid for this 
pepper? Enjoy them.” 

So the rich man ate, and 
what do you think? He had a 
heart attack that night and 
died. 



And what did Ittel do? The 
whole household was wailing 
and moaning, and Ittel just 
stood there with a scowl on 
his face and a lip curled in 
scorn. The doctor came by 
and saw him. “Ittel,” he ac- 
cused, “what’s with you? This 
man was your benefactor ! 
Now that he is dead, can’t you 
at least look sorry?” 

Ittel gave the doctor a look. 
“Sorry!” he said. “Sorry! I 
try to do something nice for 
him, and look how he pays me 
back ! ” 

S O I remember my friend 
Saul. There he was in his 
cellar, and maybe he was the 
only man in the world who 
knew that the way to the plan- 
ets did not lie through rockets 
and metal ships but ( I remem- 
ber him tapping his skull) the 
power of the mind. 

I took his mind off his sci- 
ence. 

I showed him Girls. 

He never did anything. He 
was a bum all his life, this boy 
that maybe could have shown 
us all the way from 18 billion 
people and spinach Jello. 

I tried to do something nice 
for him — and look how he 
paid us all back! 

You call that gratitude?

The future lies ahead.

A LIFE AND A/HALF 



79 



By ROSEL GEORGE BROWN 




Certainly alien children ought to be jed . , 




<<TTAPPY birthday to you,*’ 
-TS- we all sang, except Gail, 
of course, who was still 
screaming, though not as 
loud. 

“Well, now,” I said jovially, 
glancing nervously about at 
the other air traffic, “what 
else can we all sing?” The 
singing seemed to be working 



nicely. They had stopped 
swatting each other with their 
lunch boxes and my expe- 
rienced ear told me Gail wa.s 
by this time forcing herself 
to scream. This should be the 
prelude to giving up and en- 
joying herself. 

*‘Boing down in Texas in 
eighteen-ninety,” Billy began. 



80 



“Davy, Davy Eisenhower . 

“A-B-C-D-E— ” sang Ja- 
cob. 

“Dere was a little ’elicop- 
ter red and blue," Meli chirp- 
ed, “flew along de air- 
ways — ” 

The rest came through un- 
identifiably. 

“Ba-ba-ba," said a faint 



voice. Gail had given up. I 
longed for ears in the back of 
my head because victory was 
mine and all I needed to do 
was reinforce it with a little 
friendly conversation. 

“Yes, dear?" I asked her 
encouragingly. 

“Ba-ba-ba," was all I could 
make out. 



81 




‘^Yes, indeed. That Gail 
likes to go to Playplace.” 
“Ba-ba-ba!” A little irri- 
table. She was trying to say 
something important. “Ba-ha- 
ba!” 

I signaled for an emer- 
gency hover, turned around 
and presented my ear. 

“Me eat de crus’ of de 
toas’,” Gail said. She beamed. 
I beamed. 

W E MANAGED to reach 

Playplace without inci- 
dent, except for a man who 
called me an obscenity. The 
children and I, however, call- 
ed him a great, big alligator 
head and on the whole, I 
think, we won. After all, how 
can a man possibly be right 
when faced with a woman 
and eight tiny children? 

I herded the children 
through the Germ Detection 
Booth and Gail was returned 
to me with an incipient strep- 
tococcus infection. 

“Couldn’t you give her the 
shot here?” I asked. “I’ve 
just got her in a good mood, 
and if I have to turn around 
and take her back home 
. and besides, her mother 
works. There won’t be anyone 
there.” 

“Verne, dear, we can’t risk 
giving the shot until the child 
is perfectly adjusted to Play- 
place. You see, she’d connect 
the pain of the shot with com- 
ing to school and then she 
might never adjust.” Mrs. 
Baden managed to give me 



her entire attention and hold a 
two-and-a-half-year-old child 
on one shoulder and greet 
each entering child and break 
up a fight between two ill- 
matched four-year-olds, all at 
the same time. 

“Me stay at school,” Gail 
said resolutely. 

There was a scream from 
the other side of the booth. 
That was Billy’s best friend. 
I waited for the other scream. 
That was Billy. 

“Normal aggression,” Mrs. 
Baden said with a smile. 

I picked up Gail. Act first, 

talk later. 

“Oh, there she is,” Mrs. 
Baden said, taking my elbow 
with what could only be a 
third hand. 

Having heard we’d have a 
Hiserean child in Billy’s 
group, I managed not to look 
surprised. 

“Mrs. His-tara, this is 
Verne Barrat. Her Billy will 
be in Hi-nin’s group.” 

I was immediately frozen 
with indecision. Should I 
shake hands? Merely smile? 
Nod? Her hands looked wav- 
ery and boneless. I might in- 
jure them inadvertently. 

I settled on a really good 
smile, all the way back to my 
bridge. “I am so delighted to 
meet you,” I said. I felt as 
though the good will of the 
entire World Conference rest- 
ed on my shoulders. 

Her face lighted up with 
the most sincere look of pleas- 
ure I’ve ever seen. “I am glad 

ROSEL GEORGE BROWN 



82 



to furnish you this delight/’ 
she said, with a good deal of 
lisping over the dentals, be- 
cause Hisereans have fore- 
shortened teeth. She embrac- 
ed me wholeheartedly and 
gave me a scaly kiss on the 
cheek. 

My fii*st thought was that 
I was a success and my second 
thought was. Oh, God, what’ll 
happen when Billy gets hold 
of little Hi-nin? Hisereans, as 
I understood it, simply didn’t 
have this “normal aggres- 
sion.” Indeed, I sometimes 
have trouble believing it’s 
really normal. 

“I was thinking,” Mrs. Ba- 
den said, putting down the 
two-and-a-half-y ear-0 Id and 
plucking a venturesome little 
girl in Human Fly Shoes 
from the side of the building, 
“that you all might enjoy hav- 
ing Hi-nin in your car pool.” 

“Oh, we’d love to,” I said 
eagerly. “We’ve got five ma- 
mas and eight children al- 
ready, of course, but I’m sure 
everyone — ” 

“It would trouble you!” 
Mrs. His-tara exclaimed. Her 
eye stalks retracted and tears 
poured down her cheeks. “I 
do not want to be of difficul- 
ty,” she said. 

S INCE she had no apparent 
handkerchief and wore 
some sort of permanent-look- 
ing native dress, I tore a 
square out of my paper morn- 
ing dress for her. 

“You are too good!” she 



sobbed, fresh tears pouring 
out. 

“No, no. I already tore out 
two for the children. I always 
get my skirts longer in cold 
weather because children are 
so careless about carrying — ” 

“Then we’ll consider the 
car pool settled?” Mrs. Baden 
asked, coming in tactfully. 

“Naturally,” I said, mental- 
ly shredding ray previous sen- 
tence. “We would feel so hon- 
ored to have Hi-nin — ” 

“Do not think of putting 
yourself out. We do not have 
a helicopter, of course, but 
Hi-nin and I can so easily 
walk.” 

I was rapidly becoming un- 
able to think of an}d;hing at 
all because Gail was trying to 
use me for a merry-go-round 
and I kept switching her 
from hand to hand and I could 
hear her beginning to build up 
the ba-bas. 

“My car pool,” I said, 
“would be terribly sad to 
think of Hi-nin walking.” 

“You would?” 

'^Terribly.'* 

“In such a case — if it will 
give you pleasure for me to 
accept?” 

“It would,” I said fervent- 
ly, holding Gail under one 
arm as she was beginning to 
kick. 

And on the way home all 
the second thoughts began. 

/ would be glad to have Hi- 
nin in the car pool. Four of 
the other mamas were like 
me, amazed that anyone was 



CAR POOL 



83 



willing to put up with her 
child all the way to and from 
Play place. I could count on 
them to cooperate. But Gail’s 
mama ... I’d gone to Western 
State Preparation for Living 
with Regina Raj’mond Crow- 
ley. 

I landed on the Crowley 
home and tooted for five min- 
utes before I remembered 
that Regina was at work. 

“Afa-ma!” Gail began. 

“Wouldn’t you like to come 
to Verne’s house,” I asked, 
“and we can call up your ma- 
ma?” 

“No.” Well, I asked, didn’t 
I? 

1 was carrying Gail down 
the steps from my roof when 
1 bumped unexpectedly into 
Clay. 

“What is that!” he exclaim- 
ed, and Gail became again 
flying blonde hair and kicking 
feet. 

“Regina’s child,” I said. 
“What are you doing home?” 

“Accountant sent me back. 
Twenty-five and a half hours 
is the maximum this week. 
Good thing, too. I’ve got a 
headache.” He eyed Gail 
meaningfully. She was ob- 
viously not the sort of thing 
the doctor orders for a head- 
ache. 

“I can’t help it, honey,” I 
said, sitting down on a step 
to tear anothei’ handkerchief 
square from my skirt. “I’m 
going to call Regina at work 

now. ” 

“Don’t you have a chairman 



to take care of things like 
that?” 

“I am the chairman,” I said 
proudly. 

“Why in heaven’s name did 
you let yourself get roped 
into something like that?” 

“I was selected by Mrs. Ba- 

don ! 

“Obscenity,” said Clay. It 
is his privilege, of course, to 
use this word. 

T he arty little store whei*e 
Regina works has a tele- 
phane as well as a telephone, 
and in color, at that. So I 
could see Regina in full color, 
taking her own good time 
about switching on the sound. 
She switched on as a sort of 
afterthought and tilted her 
nose at me. I don’t suppose 
slie can really tilt her nose up 
and down, but she always 
gives that impression. 

“Gail has an incipient strep- 
tococcus infection,” I said. 
“They sent her home.” 
“Ma-ma!” Gail cried. 

“Why didn’t they give her 
a shot thei'e ? That’s what 
they did with my niece last 
year. ” 

I explained why not. 
Regina sighed resignedly. 
“Verne, people can talk you 
into anjdhing. There are times 
when you have to be firm. 1 
work, girl. That’s why I put 
Gail in Play place. I can’t 
leave here until twelve 
o’clock.” 

“But what’ll I do with 
Gail?” 



84 



ROSEL GEORGE BROWN 



“Take her back. Or you 
keep her until I get home. 
Sorry, Verne, but you got 
youi*self into this.” 

I switched off, furious. 

Then I remembered Hi-nin. 
I couldn’t be furious. I was 
going to have to get Regina’s 

cooperation. 

I picked up Gail and went 
into the bedroom. “I do not 
dislike Regina Crowley,” 1 
wrote with black crayola on a 
piece of note paper. I stuck it 
into a crevice of my mirror 
and gave Gail my bare-shoul- 
der decorations to play with 
while 1 concentrated on think- 
ing up reasons why I should 
not dislike Regina Crowley. 

“I do,” Clay said, sneaking 
up so quietly I jumped two 

“So do I,” I said, gazing 
wearily at my note. “But I 
have to have her in a good 
mood. You see, there’s this 
Hiserean child and since I’m 
chairman of the car pool, I 
have to — ” 

''Don't tell me about it,” 
Clay said. “My advice to you 
is get elephantiasis of youi' 
steering foot and give the 
whole thing up now.” Ho 
glanced meaningfully at Gail, 
who couldn’t possibly be both- 
ering him. She was playing 
quietly on the floor, pulling 
the suction disks off my jew- 
elry and sticking them on hei’ 
legs. 

When I finally got Gail 
home, she sped into her moth- 
er’s arms and I couldn’t help 



being a little irritated because 
I had been practically swing- 
ing from the ceiling dust 
controls to ingratiate myself, 
and her mama just said, “Oh, 
hi,” and Gail was satisfied. 

“By the way,” I said, 
watching Regina hang up her 
dark blue hand-woven jacket, 
“you wouldn’t mind picking 
up an extra child tomorrow, 
would you?” 

“Mind! Certainly I mind. 
I’ve got as much as I can do 
with my job and Gail and 
eight children in the heli al- 
ready. ” 

“It’s a Hiserean child,” I 
said. “The mother is so love- 
ly, Regina. She didn’t want us 
to go to any trouble.” 

“That’s fine. Because I’m 
not going to go to any trou- 
ble.” 

I put my fists behind my 
back. “Of course I under- 
stand, Regina. I think it’s re- 
markable that you manage to 
do so much. And keep up with 
your art things as you do. But 
don’t you think it would be 
an interesting experience to 
have a Hiserean child in the 
pool ?” 

"OEGINA pulled off her 
hand - woven wrap - skirt 
and I was shocked to see she 
wore a real boudoir slip to 
work. 

“Everybody to their own 
interesting experiences,” she 
said, laughing at me. This 
was obviously one of her 
triple-level remarks. 



CAR POOL 



85 



“De gustibus,” I said, to 
show I know a few arty things 
myself, “non disputandum 
est." 

“You have such moments, 
Verne! Have you ever seen a 
Hiserean child?” 

“I saw one today.” 

“Well.” 

“Well?” 

“De gustibus, as you said. 
You know the other children 
will eat it alive, don’t you? 
Your child will. Now Gail ...” 

It’s true that Gail never 
kicks anyone small enough to 
kick back. It’s also true that 
Billy bites. 

I unclenched my fists and 
stretched up with a deep 
breath so as to relax my stom- 
ach and improve my posture. 

“Hiserean children,” I 
pointed out, “are going to 
have to be adjusted to our so- 
ciety. As I understand it, 
they’re here to stay. Their 
sun blew up behind them and 
personally I think we’re lucky 
they happened to drift here.” 

“I don’t see why it’s so 
lucky. I wish we’d gotten one 
of the ships full of scientific 
information. Or their top 
scientists. Or artists, for that 
matter. All ive got were plain 
people. If you like to call them 
people.” 

“They’re at least educated 
people with good sense. And 
we’ve got their ship to take 
apart and learn things from. 
And their books and, after all, 
some music and their gestural 
art. I should think you artists 



would find that real avant 
garde.” 

“Just hearing you say it 
like that is enough to kill 
Hiserean art.” 



“Regina, I know you think 
I’m a prig, but that isn’t the 
point. And if it matters to 
you. I’m not a prig.” 

“Do you wear boudoir 
slips?” Regina was biting a 
real smile. 

“No, I don’t. But I’d like 




“Then why don’t you?” 

“Because I put one on once 
and I thought I looked abso- 
lutely devastating and you 
know what my husband 
said?” 

“I won’t try to guess Clay’s 
bon mot.” 

“He said, ‘What did you 
put that on for?’ ” 



REGINA LAUGHED until 

she popped a snap on her 
paper house dress. “But se- 
riously,” she said finally, “if 
he didn’t know, why didn’t 
you tell him?” 

“That’s not the point. The 
point is I am not the boudoir- 
slip type. My unmentionables 
are unmentionable for esthet- 
ic reasons only.” 

Regina laughed again. 
“Really, Verne, you’re not 
half bad when you try.” 

“If you honestly think I’m 
not half bad, could you do it 
just as a favor to me? Pick 
up Hi-nin when you have the 
car pool?” 

“The Hiserean child? No.”

“Please, Regina. I’d do it 
for you except that the chil- 
dren would notice and it would 
get back to Mrs. His-tara. If 
there’s anything I could do 
for you in return — ” 

“What could you possibly 
do?” 

“I don’t know. But I can’t 
go back and tell that dear 
creature our car pool doesn’t 
want her.” 

“Stoy looking so intense. 
That’s what keeps you from 
being the boudoir-slip type. 
You always look as though 
you’re going out to break up 
a saloon or campaign for bet- 
ter Public Child Protection. 
The boudoir slip requires a 
languorous expression.” 
“Phooey to looking lan- 
guorous. And phooey to bou- 
doir slips. I’d wear diapers to 
nursery school if you’d change 
vour mind about taking along 
Hi-nin.” 

“Would you wear a boudoir 

slip?” 

“I — hell, yes.” 

“And nothing else?” 

“Only my various means of 
support. And my respectabil- 
ity.” 

Regina laughed her tiger- 
on-the-third-Christian laugh. 

“What I want to find out,” 
she said, “is how you manage 
the respectability bit.” 

It dawned on me while I 
was grinding the pepper for 
Clay’s salad that Regina had 

explained herself. All of a 
sudden I saw straight through 
her and I wondered why I 



hadn’t seen it before. Regina 
envied me. 

Now on the face of it, that 
seemed unlikely. But it oc- 
curred to me that Regina’s 
parents had been the poor but 
honest and uneducated sort 
that simply are never asked 
to chaperone school parties. 
And the fact is thajt they were 
not what Regina thought of 
as respectable, though it 
never occurred to anyone but 
her that it mattered. And 
since all her culture was ac- 
quired after the age of thir- 
teen, she felt it didn’t fit prop- 
erly and that’s why she went 
out of her way to be arty- 
arty. 

W’hereas I took for granted 
all the things Regina had 
learned so painstakingly, and 
this in turn was what made 
me so irritatingly respectable. 

As Regina had suggested, 
perhaps it is the expression 
on one’s face that makes the 
difference. 

•'<T¥EY!” a cop yelled, pull- 

■H ing up as close to us as 
his rotors would allow. “What 
the hell?” 

“I beg your pardon,” I said 
frigidly. It is very frigid in 
November if you are out in a 
helicopter dressed only in a 
boudoir slip. 

“Look de bleesemans !” Gail 
cried. 

“He might shoot every- 
body!” Billy warned. 

Meli began to cry loudly. 
“He might choot! Ma-ma!” 



CAR POOL

“Pardon me, madam,” the 
cop said, and beat a hasty re- 
treat. 

When we landed on Hi-nin’s 
roof, Mrs. His-tara came up 
with him. She looked at me 
sympathetically. “You are 
perhaps molting, beloved 
friend?” Her large eyes re- 
tracted and filled with tears. 

“Such a season !” 

“No — no, dear. Just — get- 
ting a little fresh air.” 

I put Hi-nin on the front 
seat with me. He gave me a 
big-eyed, toothless smile and 
sat down in perfect quiet, ex- 
cept for the soft, almost sea 
sound of his breathing. 

It was during one of those 
brief and infrequent silences 
we have that I noticed some- 
thing was amiss. No sea 
sound. 

I looked around to find 
Billy’s hands around Hi-nin’s 
throat. 

“Billy!” I screamed. 

“Aw!” he said, and let go. 

Hi-nin began to breath 
again in a violent, choked 
way. 

“Billy,” I said, wondering 
if I could keep myself from 
simply throwing my son out 
of the helicopter, “Billy ...” 

“It is nothing, nice mama,” 
Hi-nin said, still choking. 

“Billy.” I didn’t trust my- 
self to speak any further. I 
reached around and spanked 
him until my hand was sore. 
“If you ever do that again — ” 

‘*Waar Billy bawled. I’m 
sure he could be heard quite 

83 



plainly by the men building 
the new astronomical station 
on the Moon. 

1 PUT Hi-nin on my lap and 
kept him there. “That’s 
just Billy’s way of making 
friends,” I whispered to him. 

Under Billy’s leadership, 
several other children began 
to cry, and all in all it was not 
a well-integrated, love-shar- 
ing group that I lifted down 
from the heli at Playplace. 

“The children always sense 
it, don’t they,” Mrs. Baden 
said with her gentle smile, 
“when we don’t feel comfort- 
able about a situation?” 
'‘Comfortable!” I cried. It 
seemed to me the day had be- 
come blazing hot and I didn't 
1‘emember what I was dressed 
in until I tried to take off my 
jacket. “My son is an inhu- 
man monster. He tried to — 
to — ” I could feel a big sob 
coming on. 

“Bite?” Mrs. Baden sup- 
plied helpfully. 

“Strangle,” I managed to 
blurt out. 

“We’ll be especially con- 
siderate of Billy today,” 
Mrs. Baden said. “He’ll be 
feeling guilty and he senses 
your discomfort about his 
aggression.” 

“Senses it! I all but tore 
him limb from limb! That 
dear little Hiserean child — ” 
“I do not want to be of diffi- 
culty,” Hi-nin said, tears 
pouring out of those great, 
big eyes. 

ROSEL GEORGE BROWN 



T ears were pouring out of 
my small blue eyes by this 
time and Mr. Grantham, who 
brings a set of grandchildren, 
came by and patted my shoul- 
der. 

“Chin up!” he said. “Eyes 
front!” 

Then he looked at his hand 
and my recently patted shoul- 
der. 

“Oh, excuse me,” he said. 
“Would you like to borrow my 
jacket?” 

I shook my head, acutely 
aware, suddenly, that Mr. 
Grantham is not a doddering 
old grandfather but a young 
and handsome man. And all 
he thought about my bare 
shoulder was that it ought to 
be covered. 

“You just run along,” Mrs. 
Baden said. “We’ll let Billy 
strangle the pneumatic dog 
and everything will be just 
fine. Oh, and dear — I don’t 
know whether you’ve noticed 
it — you don’t have on a 
dress.” 

I went home and sat in 
front of the mirror feeling 
miserable in several different 
directions. If Regina Ray- 
mond Crowley appeared in 
public dressed only in a bou- 
doir slip, people would think 
all sorts of wicked things. 
When I appeared in public in 
a boudoir slip, everybody 
thought I was just a little 

absentminded. 

This, I thought, is a hell of 
a thing to^orry about. And 
then I thought. Oh, phooey. If 



even I think I’m respectable, 
what can I expect other peo- 
ple to think? 

I took down the note on the 
mirror about Regina. No won- 
der I didn’t like her ! I turned 
the paper over and wrote 
“Phooey to me!” with my eye- 
brow pencil. 

I was still regarding the 
note and trying to argue my- 
self into a better mo<^ when 
Clay came tramping down 
from work at three o’clock. 

“Why are you sitting 
around in a boudoir slip?” he 
asked. 

“You’re a double-dyed louse 
and a great, big alligator 
head,” I told him. 

“Don’t mention it,” he said, 
“Where’s Billy?” 

“Taking his nap. Tell me 

the truth, Clay. The absolute 
truth.” 

Clay looked at me suspi- 
ciously. “I’d planned on a 
little golf this afternoon.” 

“This won’t take a minute. 
I don’t ask you things like this 
all the time, now do I?” 

“I still don’t know what 
you’re talking about.” 

I took a deep breath. “Clay, 
is there an5d;hing about me, 
anything at all, that is not re- 
spectable ?” 

“There is not” he said. 

“Well — I guess that’s all 
there is to it,” I sighed. I pull- 
ed off my boudoir slip and got 
a neat papei’ one out of the 
slot, “Anyway,” I said brave- 
ly, “boudoir slips have to be 
laundered.” 



CAR POOL

Clay looked at me curiously 
for a moment and then said, 
“This looks like a good after- 
noon to go play golf.” 

“Do you think there’s any- 
thing not respectable about 
Regina Crowley?” 

“There is everything not 
respectable about Regina 
Crowley,” Clay said vehe- 
mently. 

“You see?” 

“Frankly, no.” 

“Well, do you think her 
husband uses that tone of 
voice when he says, ‘There is 
everything respectable about 
Verne Bar rat?’ ” 

“I don’t know why he 
should say that at all.” 

“She might ask him.” 
“Darling, you’re mad as a 
hatter,” Clay said, kissing me 
good-by. 

“Do you really think so?” 
“Of course not,” Clay roar- 
ed as he tramped up the steps 
to the heli. 

A bout nine o’clock the 

next morning I heard a 
heli landing on the roof and I 
thought. Now who? There was 
much tooting, and when I 
went up, Regina practically 
threw Hi-nin at me. 

“I told you so,” she snap- 
ped at me. Her face was burn- 
ing red and she wasn’t 
bothering to tilt her nose. 

“Wliat happened? Why did 
you bring him back to we?” 
“His hand,” she said, and 
took off. 

Hand? He was holding one 



hand over the other. No! I 
grabbed his hands to see what 
it was. 

One hand had obviously 
been bitten off at the wrist. 
He was holding the wound 
with the tentacles of his oth- 
er little boneless hand. There 
was very little blood. 

“It is as nothing,” he said, 
but when I cradled him in my 
aims, I could feel him shaking 
all over. 

“It will grow back,” he 

said. 

Would it? 

I took him in the heli and 
held him while I drove. I 
could feel him trying to stop 
himself from shaking, but he 
couldn’t. 

“Does it hurt very much?” 

T ^ ^ K Afl 

“The pain is small,” he 
said. “It is the fear. The fear 
is teiTible. I am unable to 
swallow it.” 

I was unable to swallow it, 
too. 

“The hand,” said Mrs. His- 
tara without concern, “will 
grow back. But the things 
within my son ...” She, too, 
began to tremble involuntar- 
ily. 

“Billy,” I began, feeling the 
blood come through my lower 
lip, “Billy and I are . .” It 
was too inadequate to say it. 

“It was not Billy,” Hi-nin 
said without rancor. “It was 

Gail.” 

“Gail! Gail doesn’t bite!” 
But she had, and I broke down 
and plain cried. 



ROSEL GEORGE BROWN

“Do not trouble yourself,” 
said Mrs. His-tara. “My son 
receives from this a wound 
that does not heal. On Hiserea 
he would be forever sick, you 
understand. On your world, 
where everyone is born with 
this open wound, it will be his 
protection. So Mrs. Baden 
warned me and I think she is 

wise.” 

As soon as I got home, I 
called up Regina. She looked 
pale and lifeless against the 
gaudy, irresponsible objects 
in the art shop. 

“It wasn’t my fault,” she 
said quickly. “I can’t drive 
and watch the children at the 
same time. I told you the chil- 
dren would eat ...” She stop- 
ped, and for the first time I 
saw Regina really horrified 
with herself. 

“Nobody said it was your 
fault. But don’t you think you 
could have taken Hi-nin home 
yourself? To show Mrs. His- 
tara that — I don’t know what 
it would show.” 

It reminded me, somehow, 
of the time Regina stepped on 
a lizard and left it in great 
pain, pulling itself along by 
its tiny front paws, and I had 
said, “Regina, you can’t leave 
that poor thing suffering,” 
and she had said, “Well, I 
didn’t step on it on purpose,” 
and I had said, “Somebody’s 
got to kill it now,” and she had 
said, “I’ve got a class.” I 
could still feel the crunch of 
it under my foot as its tiny 
life went out. 



“Sorry, Verne,” she said, 
“you got yourself into this,” 
and hung up. 

T hat night Regina called 

me. “Can you give blood?” 
she asked. 

“Yes,” I said. “If I stuff 
myself, I can get the scales up 
to a hundred and ten pounds.” 
“What type?” 

“B. Rh positive.” 

“Thought you told me that 
once. Gail is in the hospital. 
They have to replace every 
drop of blood in her body. She 
may die anyhow.” 

I thought of the little fluff 
and squeak that was Gail. I 
eat de crus’ of de toas’. 

“What’s the matter with 
her?” I asked fearfully. 

“That damn Hiserean child 
is poison. Gail had a little cut 
inside her mouth from where 
she fell off the slide at school.” 
“I’ll be at the hospital in 
ten minutes,” I said, and 
hung up shakily. “Dinner is 
set for seven-thirty,” I told 
Clay and Billy, and rushed 
out. 

The first person I saw at 
the hospital was not Regina. 
It was Ml'S. His-tara. 

“How did you know?” I 
asked. Her integument was 
dull now and there were 
patches of scales rubbed off. 
Her eyes were almost not vis- 
ible. 

“Mrs. Crowley called me,” 
she said. “In any case I 
would have been here. There 
is in Hi-nin also of poison. 



CAR POOL 



91 



There remains for him only 
the Return Home. We must 
rejoice for him.” 

The smile she brought forth 
was more than I could bear. 

“Gail’s germs were poison 
to him?” 

“Oh, no. He poisons him- 
self. It is an ancient hormone, 
from the early days of our 
race when we had what your 
Mrs. Baden so wisely calls ag- 
gression. It is dormant in us 
since before the accounting of 
our history. An adult Hiser- 
ean, perhaps, could fight his 
emotions and cure himself. 
Hi-nin has no weapons — so 
your physicians have explain- 
ed it to me, from our scientific 
books. How can I doubt that 
they are right?” 

How could I doubt it, 
either? It would be, I thought, 
rather like a massive overdose 
of adrenalin. Psychogenic, of 
course, but what help was it 
to know that? Would there be 
some organ in Hi-nin a sur- 
geon could remove? Like the 
adrenals in humans, perhaps? 

Of course not. If they could 
have, they would have. 



I 



lURRIED on to fin( 
oom where Gail was 
not Dale, as I had ex 



ed, but pink-cheeked and 
bright-eyed. They were prob- 
ably putting in more blood 
than they were taking out. 
There were two of the other 
mamas from our car pool, 
waiting their turns. 



was 



the 



bed, her face ugly and swol- 
len from crying. 

“She looks just fine!” I ex- 
claimed. 

“Only in the last fifteen 
minutes,” she said. “When I 
called you, she was like ice. 
Her eyes didn’t move.” 

“We’re lucky with Gail. 
Did you know about Hi-nin?” 

“The little animal!” she 

said. “He’s the one that did 
it.” 

“He didn’t do anything, Re- 
gina, and you know it.” 

“He shouldn’t have been in 
the car pool. He shouldn’t be 
with human children at all.” 

“He’s going to die,” I said 
quickly, before she had time 
to say things she’d have night- 
mares about later on. 

“Sorry,” Regina said, be- 
cause we were all looking at 
her and because her child was 
pink and beautiful and 
healthy while Hi-nin . 

“Regina,” I said, “what did 
you do after it happened?” 

“Do! It scared the hell out 
of me — that creature shaking 
all over and Gail screaming. 
At first I didn’t know what 
had happened. Then I saw 
that thing flopping around on 
the front seat and I screamed 
and threw it out of the win- 
dow. And then I noticed Hi- 
nin ’s wrist, or whatever you 
call it. I said, ‘Oh, God, I 
knew you’d get us in trouble!’ 
But the creature didn’t say 
anything. He just sat there. 
And I let the other children 
off and brought Hi-nin to you 




ROSEL GEORGE BROWN 




because I didn’t want to get 
involved with that Mrs. Ba- 
den.” 

“And Gail?” 

“She seemed all right. She 
just climbed in the back with 
the other children and pretty- 
soon they were all laughing.” 

“And all that time little Hi- 
nin . Regina, didn’t you 
even pat him or hold him or 
kiss it for him or anything?” 

‘‘Kiss it!” 

At that moment Mrs. His- 
tara came in, with Mrs. Ba- 
den and a doctor behind her. 
I should have known. Mrs. 
Baden didn’t leave people to 
fight battles alone. 

Mrs. His-tara looked at 
Mrs. Baden, but Mrs. Baden 
only nodded and smiled en- 
couragingly at her. 

T he doctor was gently pull- 
ing the needle out of Gail’s 
vein. The room was silent. 
Even Gail sat large-eyed and 
solemn. 

“Mrs. Crowley,” Mrs. His- 
tara began, obviously drag- 
ging each word up with great 
effort, “would it be accurate 
to tell my son that Gail has 
received no hurt from him? 
We must, you see, prepare 
him for the Return Home.” 
Regina looked around at us 
and at Gail. She hadn't dared 
let herself look at Mrs. His- 
tara yet. 

“Doctor!” Regina called 
suddenly. “Look at Gail’s 
mouth ! ” 

Even from where I was, I 



could see it. A scaly growth 
along both lips. 

“That’s a temporary effect 
of the serum,” the doctor 
said. “We tried an antitoxin 
before we decided to change 
the blood. It is nothing to 
worry about.” 

“Oh.” 

“Mrs. Ci*owley,” Mrs. His- 
tara began again, “it is much 
to ask, but at such a moment, 
much is required. If you could 
come yourself, and if Gail 
could endure to be carried . .” 

But Gail did, indeed, look 
queer, and she stretched out 
her arms not to her mother 
but to Mrs. His-tara. 

“The tides,” Mrs. His-tara 
said, “have cast us up a mir- 
acle.” 

She gathered Gail into the 
boneless cradle of her curved 
arms. 

Regina took her sunglasses 
out of her purse and hid her 
eyes. “Mind your own damned 
business,” she told Mrs. Ba- 
den and me. 

“It is our damned busi- 
ness,” I whispered to Mrs. 
Baden, and she held my arm 
as we followed Regina down 
the hall. 

Mrs. His-tara threaded her 
way through a cordon of 
other Hisereans who must 

have been flown in for the oc- 
casion. I couldn’t see the chil- 
dren, but I could hear them. 

“Him cold!” said Gail. 
“Him scared!” 

“He’s scared of you,” Re- 
gina said. “We’re sorry, Gail. 



CAR POOL 



93 



Tell him we’re soriy. We 

didn’t understand.” 

Gail laughed. A loud and 

healthy laugh. 

“Gail sorry,” she said. “Me 
thought you was to eat.” 
There was a small sound. I 
thought it was from Hi-nin 
and I held Mrs. Baden’s hand 
as though it were my only 
link to a sane world. 

“Dat a joke,” Gail said. 
“Hi-nin ’posed to laugh!” 
Then there was a silence 
and Regina started to say 
something but Mrs. His-tara 
whispered, “Please! It is a 
thought between the chil- 
dren.” 

Then there was a small, 
quiet laugh from Hi-nin. “In 
truth,” he said with that oh, 
so familiar lisp, “it is funny.” 
“Me don’t do it again,” Gail 
said, solemn now. 

W HEN I got home it was so 

late that the stars were 
sliding down the sky and I 
just knew Clay wouldn’t have 
thought to turn the parking 
lights on. But he had. 

Furthermore, he was still 

up. 

“Were you worried?” I ask- 
ed delightedly. 

“No. Regina called a couple 

of hours ago.” 

“Reghiar 

“She said she was concern-

Clay handed me a present,

I peeled the paper off care- 
fully, to save it for Billy, and 

set the butterfly on the sticky 
side. 



inside the box was a gorge- 
ous blue fluffy affair of no 
apparent utility. 

“Oh, Clay!" I gasped. “I

slithered around me. 



Hastily, I pulled the pins 
out of my hair, brushed it 
back and smeared on some

crayola note was still stuck in

“I’m not. You don’t really 
look respectable at all, Verne.” 
I ran into the dining area. 
“Regina told you about the 
boudoir slip!” 

I heard Clay stumble over 
a chair in the dark. 

“Obscenity!” he said. “All 
right, she did. So what? I 
think you look like a call 
girl.” 

I ran into the living room 
and hid behind the sofa. “Do 
you really, truly think so?” 
“Absolutely !” Another 
chair clattered and Clay toed 
the living room lights. “Ah!” 
he said. “I’ve got you corner-

You look like an easy pickup. 
You look like a dirty little — ”

IN THE BALANCE 

Book Reviews by Frederik Pohl 



S CIENCE fiction, in its mod- 
ern, magazine-oriented 
form, has existed in this 
country for a third of a cen- 
tury. Its shape has changed 
and grown enormously in that 
time. The model of the early 
story was the work of Wells 
and Verne; its theme, the in- 
vention of a wonder — a gadg- 
et or a process; its plot, the 
trials and tribulations of the 

inventor. 

By successive strokes, suc- 
cessive writers have broken 
that mold. It has taken thirty 
years to do it, but the horizons 
are wider for all of us now. 

It was E. E. Smith who lib- 
erated us from the what-we- 
know in extraterrestrial ad- 
venture. His Richard Seaton, 
laughable clown though he 
was in normal human affairs, 
was the first of the star rov- 
ers; he landed on planets that 
did not exist in the known 
universe, circling suns that 
have never been seen. 



A few years later Stanley 
G. Weinbaum peopled those 
planets for us with a new 
sort of character. The aliens 
of Smith or, for further ex- 
ample, Edgar Rice Burroughs, 
were human. They might have 
four arms and shaggy hides, 
like the Barsoomian apes; 
they might be chunky and 
crewcut, like the Fenachrone; 
they might be catmen, lizard- 
men, antmen, plantmen or 
rockmen; but they were, al- 
ways and incurably, men. 
Weinbaum changed that. His 
Tweel (in A Martian Odys- 
sey) was not human, even 
inside. His shape was differ- 
ent, but the shape was not im- 
portant ; it was the differ- 
ence in orientation — in drives, 
goals and thought processes — 
that made the Weinbaum-type 
alien so fresh and rewarding 
in science fiction in the mid- 
thirties. 

The third writer whose 
name belongs on this select

list is Robert A. Heinlein. He 
gave us the next leg up by in- 
troducing social comment to 
magazine science fiction — not 
so much an invention as a re- 
discovery (for there had been 
Dean Swift, Wells himself, 
Bellamy, countless others), 
but all the same an important 
change of perspective. 

These three, more than any 
others, changed by their own 
writing the whole structure 
of a category of fiction. What 
Doyle and Dashiell Hammet 
were to the mystery, they 
were to science fiction. There 
were these three. 

Perhaps now there are 
four. 

T he fourth and newest is 
James Blish, who has pub- 
lished an original science fic- 
tion novel called The Triumph 
of Time. 

Blish offers us science fic- 
tion which deals with tomor- 
row on its own terms. Its peo- 
ple are those who might live 
a millennium or two from 
now, not transplanted anach- 
ronisms from 1959. Blish’s 
people have the same number 
of arms, legs and eyes as we, 
but their problems are those 
that come from strains we 
have never felt, drives we 
have never known. Weinbaum 
taught us that aliens would 
not think in our patterns. 
Now Blish comes for\vard to 
say: “And that goes for your 
own grandchildren, too!” 

The Triumph of Time is a 



sequel to Blish’s “Okie” 
stories. Probably most science 
fiction readers have encoun- 
tered one or more of these. 
For those who haven’t, Blish’s 
central thesis is a two-part 
invention which goes like 
this : 

Given a really good propul- 
sion system and plenty of 
power, there is no reason why 
a spaceship has to be any par- 
ticular size or shape. You 
could even detach a city from 
its moorings and fly it around. 
Given an Earth where life is 
difficult and other stars where 
it is easier, you would detach 
a city ; you would travel 
around the Galaxy in it, do- 
ing odd jobs. 

Blish’s central city is New 
York. In the earlier stories of 
the series. New York has dis- 
played its motto — “Mow Your 
Lawn, Lady?” — all over the 
home galaxy, an Okie city of 
migrant workers, living by its 
collective wits (and the stored 
wisdom of those remarkable 
mechanical computers, the 
City Fathers). But at last it 

has settled down on a planet 
called New Earth, located in 
the Greater Magellanic Cloud. 

What is it like, the life on 
New Earth two thousand 
years from now? 

People live, love, eat and 
sleep ; but there are basic dif- 
ferences. All of us, here and 
now, are under a death sen- 
tence imposed in the delivery 
room with our first breath. 
Blish’s hero is not : 



96 



“It was, of course, perfectly 
possible for Amalfi (the hero 
of the book) to end his life; 
he was not invulnerable, nor 
even truly immortal : immor- 
tality is a meaningless word 
in a universe where the fun- 
damental laws, being stochas- 
tic in nature, allow no one to 
bar accidents, and where life 
no matter how prolonged is at 
bottom only a local and tem- 
porary discontinuity in the 
Second Law of Thermody- 
namics. The thought, however, 
did not occur to Amalfi; he 
was not the suicidal type. He 
had never felt less tired, less 
used-up, less despairing than 
he felt today; he was simply 
snarlingly bored." 

It is, that is to say, as 
though they had the maturity 
of our oldest citizen, and 
the carefree imawareness of 
death of a teen-ager. This is 
not a state of mind we can 
easily imagine. It makes for 
strange people. 

Strange people have 
strange pets: “An occasional 
svengali from Altair IV — 
originally a rare specimen in 
the flying city’s zoo, but lat- 
terly force-budded in New 
Earth labs during the full- 
fertility program of 3950, 

when every homesteader’s 
bride had her option of a vial 
of trilby water or a gemmate 
svengali and frequently 
wound up with both among 
tlie household lares and pen- 
ates; the half-plant, half-ani- 
nial, even nowadays a not 



infrequent pet — took the 
breeze and hunted in the half- 
light of dawn or dusk. A sven- 
gali lay bonelessly in mid-lane 
and fixed its enormous eves 
on any moving object until 
something small enough and 
gelid enough to ingest might 
blunder near. Nothing suit- 
able ever did, on New Earth. 
The two-legged victim tended 
to drift helplessly into that 
hypnotic stare until the starer 
got stepped on ; then the 
svengali turned mauve and 
exuded a protective spray 
which might have been nau- 
seating on Altair IV, but on 
New Earth was only euphoric. 
Sudden friendships, bursts of 
song, even a brief and delir- 
iously happy crying jag might 
ensue, after which the shaken 
svengali would undulate back 
indoors to rest up and be 
given, usually, a bowl of jel- 
lied soup.’’ 

And the problems and ob- 
jectives of the-se people are 
also strange to us. 'Their basic 
problem is the Ginnangu-Gap. 
What is the Ginnangu-Gap? 
According to Blish, a parallel, 
reverse universe traveling 
backward in time is about to 
intersect our own ; when they 
intersect, it will be the end of 
both; even the end of time, 
the end of everything. 

And yet these people will 
not die! 

True, says one of the char- 
acters, survival past the 
Ginnangu-Gap will have se- 
rious disadvantages. “The 



97 



kind of survival involved will 
be nothing like human life as 
we know it. After we’ve de- 
scribed it to you, you may all 
much prefer to die instead. I 
will tell you flatly that that 
would be my preference.” 
And the character elaborates : 
“We will then find ourselves 
occupying as many indepen- 
dent sets of four dimensions 
as there are people in this 
room, and every set complete- 
ly empty. The spacesuits 
won’t protect you long, either, 
because you’ll be the only 
body of organized energy and 
matter in your particular, in- 
dividual universe; as soon as 
vou disturb the metrical 
frame of that universe, you, 
the suit, the air in it, the pow- 
er in the accumulators, every- 
thing will surge outwards, 
creating space as it goes. 
Every man his own mono- 
bloc. ” 

The Triumph of Time is a 
triumph of inventions, great 
and small — the flying cities 
and the anti-agathic drugs 
that make their citizens im- 
mortal; the svengalis and the 
Ginnangu-Gap. It is as if 
Blish had set himself to 
create not a story but a real 
universe. 

U nfortunately, aii 

this brilliance blinds. 
There is a blackness of incom- 
prehension, not because the 
light is not there but because 
there is so much of it, thrown 
so rapidly and violently with- 



out pause for blinking. But 
that is not the worst. What 
Blish should have created is 
not a universe but a stoiy. In 
the “story” elements, his book 
suffers harm. The jehad of 
the Warriors of God is irrele- 
vant. Amalfi’s love relation- 
ship with Dee is unrelated. 

Why must this be ? It is not 
a lack of talent on the part of 
the author. Blish can make 
characters live when he wills 
it; witness The Frozen Year 
or the incomparable A Case 
of Conscience. His Jesuit 
spaceman and his Arctic ex- 
plorer feel and move and win 
us to join their pleasures and 
sorrows. But Amalfi never 
does. 

The Triumph of Time is 
not light reading, not if one 
wants to be aware of what is 
going on. It is hard to follow 
(and made harder because 
the typesetters seem to have 
found it so too). It requires 
effort from the reader — ^first 
an effort of comprehension, 
second a conscious suspension 
of disbelief^ — especially when 
the author invites it. (For 
example, this story of the end 
of everything is cast in the 
form of a history written 
after the end!) But it is a 
new area of science fiction, 
and like most pioneer explora- 
tions, it simply maps the out- 
standing features of the 
terrain. Those who move into 
it will do the detail work, but 
Blish rates the monument as 
its discoverer.

I N PAIRING two recent 

books in its publishing 
schedule — John Bowen's Aft- 
er the Rain and Charles Eric 
Maine’s The Tide Went Out — 
Ballantine Books shows us 
the gently whimsical side of 
its nature. Both novels de- 
molish the world ; Bowen 
drowns it, Maine parches it, 
but the results are much the 
same. Both are by English 
writers. And both have one 
other point in common : 
neither is quite successful. 

What John Bowen sees is a 
traveling rainmaker employ- 
ed by the drought-stricken 
State of Texas. The rainmak- 
er goes up in his balloon and 
pushes the button on his ma- 
chine; boom, it is the end of 
the rainmaker as the balloon 
explodes, and very nearly the 
end of the world. The rain 
does not stop. Continents are 
submerged. Enormous storms 
destroy such lucky few as 
manage to board ships or 
rafts. Only a handful survive 
— ^to find a new Mount Ararat 
and to found a new world. 

Charles Eric Maine blames 
it all on H-bomb tests. A 
crack is opened in the ocean 
floor, and through it the 
waters leak away. Only on 
the ice caps of the Poles is 
life possible at all for a few, 
and the story is in the attempt 
of the many to worm their 
way in among those few — by 
trickery, violence, bribes or 
wits. 

Both stories have good 



touches of detail. Both are 
flatly impossible. There is 
not water enough in, on or 
around the Earth to drown it. 
There is not space enough un- 
der the basins of the seas to 
swallow them. It is a conven- 
tion of science fiction writers 
to get around some such an- 
noying fact by inventing a 
“gimmick factor” — Garrett 
P. Serviss in his ancient flood 
novel invented a watery 
nebula through which the 
Earth passed. Neither Bowen 
nor Maine bothered. 

A valon books, which 

seems to be pursuing a 
policy of printing the worst 
books of the best writers in 
science fiction, has just given 
us Day of the Giants by one 
“Lester del Ray.” A very cold 
winter has struck the farm of 
Leif Svensen, as cold as the 
Fimbulwinter that, in Norse 
legend, came before Ragna- 
rok. That’s not hard to under- 
stand, as it develops. A new 
Ragnarok is on its way. 
Mysterious strangers appear 
around the farm. Husky 
blonde women ride horses 
across the sky. All of them are 
gods, giants and the other 
assorted fauna of Norse 
mythology. And says the j ack- 
et copy, “thus Leif Svensen 
and his brother were caught 
up in the destinies of a real 
but alien world. For if the 
giants triumphed, they would 
then overrun Earth; and if 
the Aesir — ^the gods — ^won, 



99 



Earth would be their foot- 
stool. Leif had to use his 
knowledge of twentieth-cen- 
tury technology to help the 
far-from-divine gods.” 

It is incredible but true 
that this book is by the man 
who wrote Nerves. 

Maybe the misspelling of 
“del Rey” on the jacket isn’t 
an accident but a disguise. 

IN ANOTHER recent Avalon 
book, The Languages of Pao. 
Jack Vance has a fresher 
theme but still a less than 
successful book. Vance postu- 
lates a galaxy of inter-trading 
but politically separate plan- 
ets, each of them with a 
vaguely feudal economy. The 
freshness of Vance’s theme 
lies in his suggestion that by 
changing the language of a 
race, you can change its char- 
acter. One Palafox, a leading 
citizen of the wizard planet 
of Breakness, invents new 
languages for the weak-willed 
people of the planet Pao. 
Each class of Paonese now 
has a language of its own — 
Cogitant for the thinkers. 
Valiant for the fighters, Tech- 
nican for the machine-tend- 
ers, and so on. As the lan- 
guages are constructed, so 
their speakers will behave. 

This may or may not be 
plausible. Vance seems to 
have thought it out pretty 
carefully, and no doubt we 
can take his word for it. It 
isn’t terribly convincing as 
presented in the book, though. 



and perhaps that is because it 
is surrounded with so much 
ornamentation. The trappings 
with which Vance has invest- 
ed his central theme are 
bright baubles, and distract- 
ing. There are slave girls and 
wizards, a secret heir to a 
throne and a last-minute tri- 
umph of the Good Guys under 
unlikely circumstances. 

The linguists who spread 
these languages, Vance tells 
us, in a joking mood “con- 
trived a bastard mish-mash of 
a language, assembled from 
scraps of Paonese, Cogitant, 
Valiant, Technicant, Mercan- 
til and Batch, with a svncretic 
syntax and heterogeneous vo- 
cabulary. This patchwoik 
tongue was known as Pas- 
tiche.” Vance writes well — 
sometimes even brilliantly 
— but he writes with a Pas- 
tiche accent. 

F inally there are three 
new anthologies. 
Ballantine has brought out 
two more in the Star Science 
Fiction series — Numbers 4 
and 5 — but as they are edited 
by the undersigned, perhaps 
this is not a place in which 
they should be reviewed. 

And Groff Conklin has just 
done a new collection of ter- 
ror stories, called, simply, 
Br-r-r-! These are fantasies 
and good ones; and the col- 
lective point they make is that 
Groff Conklin is an antholo- 
gist who knows his job.

Catching him was no problem; 



they caught him everywhere — 






By J I AA HARMON 



STREET, you are the 
A foremost xenologist on 
Earth,” the director of Extra- 
terrestrial Investigations said 
to the tall man. 

“I know,” Street said. 

“What do you know al)out 
the infamous criminal, Baker, 
the so-called ‘Robin Hood’ 
who is actually a scarlet 
fiend?” 

“Everything.” 

“Surely not how he died.” 
“Everything but that.” 

The director put his brief 

101 



case on his knees. “Mr. Street, 
my agency received numerous 
accounts of his death, or 
deaths, on various worlds. 
Can you tell me which, if any, 
of these stories is true by 
studying our intelligence re- 
ports?” 

“Easily,” Street said. 

“We have had Baker under 
observation many times by 
our planted Orwells — our 

peepbugs — but you must un- 
derstand that we need abso- 
lute proo/ on him since he has 



supporters even on Eai*th, and 
in waiting for that proof, we 
lost contact often at vital mo- 
ments.” 

“I understand perfectly,” 
Street assured him. 

I 

“ARE THERE really space 
pirates?” Mrs. Fuljohn in- 
quired of him, giggling fu- 
riously. 

“Yes, Virginia, there real- 
ly are space pirates,” Baker 
assured her. 

Mrs. Fuljohn lowered very 
long lashes over formidable 
eyes. “My first name is Chris- 
tine. Will they come at us out 
of the void with all guns blast- 

“I doubt it. They would 
want to rob the liner, not dis- 
integrate it.” 

Baker excused himself and 
strolled toward the afterdeck 
of “A” class. 

He had lied to the lady. 
(The hyper-Orwell focused 
directly on him picked up the 
tiny whisper of his subvocal- 
izations.) He was a pirate, 
but there was one part of the 
cargo he did want to destroy, 
not steal — the first-grade 
readers for the Mission 
Houses for Alien Natives on 
Ignatz XI. Men called him a 
traitor to the human race, 
but he seethed at the corrup- 
tive propaganda being fed to 
the swinoid youngsters of the 
planet. 

This little piggy went to 



market, this little piggy stay- 
ed home . This little piggy 
had roast beef, this little 

piggy had none . 

It was insidious, evil. It 
said in effect that races who 
shared a common ancestor 
with the pig had better trade 
with Earthmen on their terms 
— on any terms — if they hop- 
ed to go on being allowed to 
eat. 

Double-dealing EaiThmen 
with their devious schemes 
were daily robbing literal- 
minded extraterrestrials like 
the Ignatz swinoids blind. 
Sometimes it made him 
ashamed to be an Earthman. 
Let some call him a renegade ! 
He was going to help these 
sentient beings. 

He had a plan, even if he 
lacked the armed battle cruis- 
er that the pirates had in the 
teletapes. There was a small 
corvet waiting for him on 
Ignatz XI. It lacked the i*e- 
stricted official light-drive of 
military and police craft, hav- 
ing only a civilian planetary- 
field booster, but if all went 
well, it would be sufficient for 
his escape. 

Baker glanced at the dial of 
his watch — it showed no tell- 
tale color of listening devices 
within his area. ( The detector 
had been sold to him by an 
ETI agent and, of course, it 
lied.) Confident, he stepped 
over the chain separating him 
from the stairs to “B” Deck. 

Wurmong was waiting for 
him as planned.

“Sz,” the fat, swarthy man 
said, “my brother, my 
nephews, my cousins — we will 
bring our extra luggage to the 
cargo hold tonight/' 

“I’ll predispose the guards. 
Come right into Hold 7. Un- 
derstand ?” 

“Da,” Wurmong assured 
him. 

The man on watch collapsed 
soundlessly at a ^beam of 
nerve pressure on the neck, 
and Baker slipped inside, im- 
mediately beginning to eject 
the first-grade readers 
through the escape hatch by 
the gross. 

The mercenary, Wurmong, 
and his army of family ar- 
rived with experienced stealth 
and began dumping the new 
books from their privileged 
luggage. 

Baker replaced the contents 
of the opened crates with the 
variant readers. These vol- 
umes might be the tiny coun- 
terbalance needed to free a 
world of swinoids from dom- 
ination by Earth. Who knew 
the full extent of the psycho- 
logical effect of The Three 
Little Pigs on young, forma- 
tive minds? 

His work done. Baker sadly 
regarded the precious jewels 
and the negotiable bonds 
from the registered mail. 
There was no way around it. 
This had to look like a rob- 
bery. It was necessary that he 
take them. Quickly, he stuffed 
everything into his synthetic 
appendix . 



B aker was allowed to dis- 
embark on Ignatz XI so 
that he might be traced to his 
alien fellow-conspirators. 

The heavy-jowled biped 
who greeted him at the smoky 
tavern was joyous. “You have 
done the next best thing for 
us to enabling us to tell your 
busybody missionaries to go 
home. We look upon you as 
one of our own and are hun- 
gry for the sight of you. May 
you remain with us long.” 
“Too much work,” Baker 
said, gagging over the native 
beer. “But I must ask you a 
favor. You implied you’d give 
me your right arm.” 

“Anything we have is 
yours. But would not a cadav- 
er's limb suit you as well as 
mine?” 

“I must escape from this 
world. You can give a private 
citizen like me something only 
a sovereign government can. 
I want the jump drive.” 

“Not that!” 

“Yes! I’ve earned it, 
haven't I?” 

The swinoid nodded wear- 
ily. “You have. The device will 
be put in your spacer. Use it 
only in deep space.” 

He was now in orbit. That 
was far enough out. Earth pa- 
trols could still pick him up 
easily. The ETI spy pickup 
observed him as he I’eached 
out and put a finger to the 
button of the device given him 
by the Swinoids, as Earth 
ships closed rapidly. He press- 
ed the button. 



BAKER’S DOZENS

In a crisping flash of flame, 
he lit with incredible speed. 

II 

“NATURALLY, we lost con- 
tact after the ship went up in 
flames. If that man was the 
true Baker, he was undoubted- 
ly destroyed. Of course, we 
have a report from our spies 
on Klondike II of events run- 
ning just about concurrently.” 

“If you’ll allow one inter- 
ruption,” Street interjected. 
“As a competent xenological 
ethnologist, I can assure you 
that Baker was, at least, not 
completely destroyed by the 
fire. His somewhat roasted re- 
mains would have been appro- 
priated by the swinoids.” 

“How so?’ 

“These people are as similar 
to pigs as we are to apes. 
When one of their own wishes 
to die, as they thought Baker 
did, in their typical alien lit- 
eral-mindedness, they dispose 
of his body in a special way. 
Remember how they said they 
thought of Baker as one of 
their own and were hungry 
even for the sight of him?” 

III 

BAKER HAD been walking 
for two weeks across the prim- 
itive surface of the mining 
planet, Klondike II, to reach 
the shack in the gray shadow 
of the granite mountain. It 
wasn’t gold he was after but 
escape. Unlike others seeking 



it, he had headed away from 
the saloons. But the peepbug’s 
lens of air had followed him. 

Minutes later, he was 
knocking on the door. He had 
to have a means of transpor- 
tation at least as good as gov- 
ernment ships to do his work 
of helping the aliens, and make 
his escapes. At least as good, 
and preferably better. 

The door was cracked by a 
kind-looking old man. “You 
got five seconds to get, before 
thirty thousand volts of elec- 
tricity go through those floor- 
boards you’re standing on,” 
the old man said kindly. 

“Profes.sor Gentle,” Baker 
said hastily, “I have many 
friends. One of them has told 
me you have established a 
major breakthrough in elec- 
tronics, that you have in fact 
invented a machine to trans- 
mit matter as radio and tele- 
vision transmit sound and 
sight.” 

“Some loose-lipped electron- 
ics jobber found that out, did 
he? Step right in.” 

“Do you suppose I might be 
teleported?” Baker asked ten- 
tatively. 

“Of course you can, my boy. 
But first perhaps you’d like to 
take a look at some of the 
things I have teleported so 
far.” 

Baker looked at the animals 
— they ivere animals ? — in the 
cages lining the laboratory. He 
had been hungry a minute be- 
fore. Now he had trouble just 
swallowing.

JIM HARMON 



“Like making the original 
adjustments on a video set,” 
the old man explained. “Hard 
to get your focus, your hori- 
zontal and vertical interlinea- 
tion just right. There’s some 
distortion sometimes. Sort of 
— messy. ” 

“On' soul-searching consid- 
eration—” Baker began. 

“Don’t take another step to- 
ward that door. I’ve got the 
floor checkerboard ed with elec- 
tric grids where I can turn on 
the juice wherever you set 
your foot. Control’s in my up- 
per plate. Step in that coffin, 
boy. Just my little pet name 
for it; don’t worry.” 

W ITH some degree of re- 
luctance, Baker stepped 
into the left of twin vertical 
boxes. The lid closed in his 
face and locked. 

Before he could have time 
to begin worrying about his 
air supply, the cover sprang 
open, and he stepped out. 
“Test over?” There was an 
echo. 

A man stood in front of the 
second coffin. Baker had en- 
tered the one on the left and 
he was still in front of the left 
box. 

But he was also now in 
front of the cabinet on the 
right. He had been completely 
duplicated. 

“That damned feedback 
again,” Gentle grumbled. 

In the first shock of this 
duplication and therefore 
seeming negation of his indi- 



vidual ego. Baker almost went 
mad. 

“You did this to me!” said 
Baker and Baker to Gentle, 
each drawing a concealed 
weapon and shooting tlie old 
man in the heart. 

“You two fellers drop your 
guns and stand still,” the voice 
behind them said. “The pro- 
fessor was always saying 1 
was the most simple-minded 
assistant he ever had, but I’ve 
got brains enough to pull this 
trigger on this old shotgun if 
you move.” 

(The ETI chief explained: 
“The rest is hearsay. Those 
miners spyproof their 
towns. ” ) 

The trial was short with 
Jeb, the assistant’s, testimony, 
but the jury deliberation was 
unaccountably long on the 
primitive world where justice 
ran fast for a blind woman. 

“We waited long enough,” 
Jeb said to the other men in 
the saloon. “Let’s break them 
out of the cellar and hang 
’em.” 

The miners didn’t let the 
jury set a precedent. They 
hoisted a few inside the bar 
and went out of Lone Splyg 
Hill and hoisted two more. 

“What have you idiots 
done?” the sheriff yelled as 
they trooped back into Klon- 
dike City. 

“Anticipated the verdict a 
mite,” Jeb admitted. 

“That’s just it,” the sheriff 
groaned. “It was ruled justi- 
fiable homicide. Temporary in-

sanity. At the time of the 
crime, each of the defendants 
was beside himself!” 

IV 

“OBVIOUSLY,” Street said, 
“this is no more than a folk 
legend.” 

“Are you sure?” the direc- 
tor of the ETI asked, finger- 
ing the report. 

“It can't be anything else. 
Granted that all the other 
events were true, I would 
know Baker was still alive — 
only one, because neither could 
stand the threat of the other 
to his ego. You see, the case 
would never have come to 
trial. It would have been im- 
mediately dismissed.” 

“Why?” 

“My dear fellow, both Bak- 
ers could not have been put on 
trial for the same murder, as 
any student of law would 
know. This would have violat- 
ed the basic protection of 
double jeopardy.” 

V 

A FAST spaceship to put him 
well ahead of the law, and a 
place to hide out until things 
simmered down, that was all 
Baker wanted and it was what 
he had. He was too hot for 
more. (“This is how we re- 
construct it from our inform- 
ant’s version,” the ETI chief 
said.) 

For the hundredth time, he 
located Wister VI on the star 



map. It had been discovered 
by the Gordon-Poul expedi- 
tion half a century before. 
Few people ever knew about 
it, and most of those had for- 
gotten it. He would never 
have known about it himself 
if it hadn’t been on the cre- 
dentials of that bank official. 

With those papers he was 
set to spend several profitable 
years in the Great National 
Bank. He would be an alien, 
but somehow aliens always 
seemed to have more money 
than nativ'es on any given 
planet. 

As blastdown time ap- 
proached, he read the charac- 
teristics of Wister IV and 
found his greatest inconven- 
ience would be the intense 
sunlight from the double suns, 
not bright enough to burn but 
brilliant enough to dazzle. He 
searched the ship for sun- 
glasses, but all he could find 
were snow goggles — a visor 
of black plastic with twin slits 
to look through. He put them 
on, resolving never to steal an 
improperly equipped space- 
ship again. 

“Howdy, pardner.” The hu- 
manoid at the spacepoi't was 
bald and green. He wore a 
wide-brimmed hat, chaps, and 
a large gun. Nothing else at 
all. “Forgive my informal 
dress. Forgot my kerchief, 
boots and spurs this morning. 
Who might you be?” 

Baker gave the title of his 
position at the bank, explain- 
ing it would be his job to help

arrange for loans to the local 
i*anchei*s. 

“You'll find this a friendly 

place. Tumbleweed is an afJalt 

Westeim town — we know the 
banker ain’t always the head 
of the gang of rustlers.” 

A S THE weeks passed. 
Baker learned to live with 
the aliens’ strange obsession 
with the things and persons 
of the Old West. They were 
even more fanatic than ter- 
restrial Frenchmen over the 
American Frontier. It was not 
exaggerating to say that they 
I’egarded the men in the old 
films they got from Earth as 

gods. 

They had appropriated ap- 
propriate Western given and 
surnames, but while there 
were plenty of Wills and 
Davys, and Rogerses and 
Crocketts, it was always Will 
Crockett and Davy Rogers. 
Anything other than that 
would be sacrilege. 

Baker’s biggest problem was 
getting a good mixed martini. 
Everybody on Wister VI drank 
their rotgut straight. But by 
becoming friendly with the 
bartender, Gene Gibson, at the 
Golden Slipper, he managed to 
get his mixed drinks. 

“Which, do you think was 
faster on the draw. Matt Dil- 
lon or William S. Hart?” Tom 
asked Baker early one eve- 
ning. 

“I don’t give a hoot, Gib- 
son,” Baker snarled, reaching 
for his martini. 



Shocked faces along the bar 
turned toward him, and hands 
moved toward loaded guns. 

“I meant pictures,” Baker 
.said hastily. “I wouldn’t give 
one of my pictures of Hoot 
Gibson for t^vo each of Ken 
Maynard and Tim McCoy.” 
“Eveiybody to his own 
taste,” Gibson said agreeably. 

Baker exhaled and gulped 
his drink. It had been a close 
‘^ne. 

But as time wore on, the 
habits of the West-loving 
aliens gi*ated more and more 
on Baker’s soul. He was par- 
ticularly irritated by the 
weekly ritual every male had 
of riding into the sunset. Since 
there wore two sunsets in op- 
posite directions, it was a long 
and involved and thoroughly 
annoying process. 

Tom Wayne had kept Baker 
waiting an hour at the Golden 
Slipper to discuss his loan. 

Baker was exasperated and 
dry. Local custom regarded it 
as friendly to not begin your 
drinking before your compan- 
ion arrived. 

Gibson laid out the ingre- 
dients of the martini on the 
bar. “You going to wait any 
longer for 'Tom to finish rid- 
ing into the sunset before I 
start mixing?” 

Baker whirled angrily. 
“Nuts to Tom! Mix!’* 

Before the blasphemous 
words died on his lips. Baker 
saw death in the rising bar- 
rels of the vengeful six-shoot- 
ers. 



BAKER’S DOZENS

I DOUBT this stoiy very 
much,” Street said to the di- 
rector. 

“The planet and its condi- 
tions have been verified,” the 
director replied. 

“Even better reason to doubt 
that Baker died there. He 
probably was worshipped as 
one of the gods.” 

“Why do you think that?” 
the director asked the xenol- 
ogist. 

“Think it out for yourself. 
Imagine the reception that 
would be given to a man who 
stepped out of a spaceship, 
wearing what would appear 
to be a black mask, and who 
told these people he was the 
loan arranger.” 

VII 

BAKER jammed the accelera- 
tor of the groundcar down un- 
til his thumbnail turned white. 
The eye of the ETI peepbug 
observed the police car of the 
native authorities behind 
Baker’s vehicle, closing fast. 

This is how it happens, he 
subvocalized. A great career 
in interplanetary crime ends 
with an arrest by hick cops 
for selling dirty books. Why 
had he ever sunk so low? 
That was easy — it took a 
stake to do anything big and 
he had to get a pile by selling 
books, after that had happen- 
ed to him on Wellington I. 

The Decameron, Forever 



Amber, Pierre Louys, all the 
old classics like that still went 
over with some of the human- 
oid and biped races. (He had 
none of the newer stuff, only 
titles in the public domain — 
he couldn’t force himself to 
fall to the level of a literary 
pirate.) But here on Lintz III 
he was slaying braces of fowl 
with a single stone. Lintzians 
were highly stimulated by in- 
tricate philosophy and math- 
ematics. This allowed him to 
sell banned copies of Koi*zyb- 
ski at outrageous prices, while 
at the same time introducing 
the native intellectuals to hu- 
man semantics, a definite aid 
to the natives in throwing off 
the verbal domination by 
Eaiihmen. 

T he Humans First Lobby 

in the Galactic Legislature 
was willing to live with the 
difficulties caused by the abso- 
lute literal-mindedness of 
most extraterrestrials, so long 
as they could continue to make 
them believe in lifetime guar- 
antees and unbreakable toys 
for inventive youngsters. 

True, many a human trav- 
eler had lived to regret a 
chance remark to the effect 
he could eat a horse, and no- 
body likes to think of what 
happened to people who ex- 
claimed a preference for be- 
ing damned within range of 
obliging natives, but all in all, 
those were minor liabilities in 
the path of the infernal ma- 
chine of progress. The ETI 



JIM HARMON 



108 



was working double-shifts to 
find human renegades who 
were teaching the semantic 
variations in woi'ds of human 
speech to aliens. On a world 
where philosophy and highei’ 
math were themselves pro- 
scribed because of tiie limit- 
ing factor of narcotic colloid- 
al reaction, he also had to 
reckon with native cops. 

He wasn’t going to be able 
to outrun this squadcar. Baker 
let it pull alongside and dialed 
himself regretfully toward 
the embankment. Then as the 
police matched his maneuver, 
he switched on emergency 
power and sideswiped them 
with an ear-jarring crash. 
Thrown from the counterbal- 
ance of its gravitic suspension 
system, the squadcar sailed off 
as helplessly as a balloon. 

^^OYSHID!” Baker yelled 

-IV on entering his quar- 
ters. “Get my smoking jacket ! 
Isn’t dinner prepared yet?” 

The turbaned, green-skin- 
ned native did what might 
have been called a salaam if 
he had been a Moslem instead 
of a Hindu. “Everything is in 
readiness, Sahib.” 

Baker was sorry he had 
spoken so shortly, but some- 
how he always did. Ryshid un- 
derstood. Baker was under a 
terrible strain, not knowing 
when the ETI might descend 
on him. There was also the 
matter of Malissa, his wife, 
whom he missed very much. 

But as a Hinduphile, a true 
BAKER’S DOZENS 



convert, Ryshid was of a gen- 
tle and foi’giving nature. 

As Baker settled back in his 
easy chair, someone started 
smashing in the back door. 

By the time the police of 
Lintz reached the living room. 
Baker was gone. 

“Alas,” the sergeant-major 
intoned, “if only the sinner 
had repented his purchase of 
the forbidden book before in- 
stead of after he finished 
reading it.” 

AS SOON as he lifted the cur- 
tain of his own modest dwell- 
ing in the native quarter, Ry- 
shid knew there was someone 
in the darkness, waiting for 
him. 

“I hope you don’t mind, old 
boy,” Baker said. “Didn’t 
know where else to go to es- 
cape being hunted down.” 

“I am overjoyed to find you 
well. Sahib. How did you es- 
cape?” 

Baker told him about his 

escape, but somehow his talk 
kept coming back to Malissa, 
his wife. “I tell you it would 
take Kathleen Windsor to de- 
scribe her. She’s — but I’m a 
bore, Ryshid.” 

Ryshid drew the gun with 
a graceful movement. “As you 
say. Sahib. I have read of oui* 
traditional life in India, and 
as a Hindu I know what I 
must do when I find my home 
has been invaded by a hunted 
boar. ” 

Ryshid squeezed the trig- 
ger.

* 

“THE SHOT,” the chief said 
to Street, “unfortunately de- 
stroyed our peepbug.” 

“You were taken there,” 
Street replied. “There is only 
one way to describe verbally 
Baker’s attitude toward his 
man, proving this was all an 
act. A good Hindu would 
never harm Baker. His wife 
is built like a cow.” 

IX 

THORSEN CHECKED his 
gun inside his cummerbund. 
That was about the only place 
a man or woman had to hide 
a weapon in these times of 
relatively tight fashions on 
Earth. The gun was still there, 
safety oif, as he firmly ex- 
pected. 

He settled back in his chair 
and glanced across the restau- 
rant at Hastings, the traitor. 
An infamous outlaw such as 
Baker could count on few 
friends — one less than even 
he expected. The reward on 
the criminal had grown siz- 
able. Not that Thorsen was 
going to get any of it. All he 
had to do was kill the poor 
devil on sight. It would be 
foolish to say that he didn’t 
like killing; it was his job in 
the ETI, but sometimes he 

wearied of his work. 

What did Baker look like? 

It was a good question and 
it would give him something 
to think about while he wait- 



ed. On the face of the exist- 
ing evidence, it was obvious 
that Baker had somewhere 
discovered some means of su- 
perlative disguise. He could so 
change himself with stretch- 
ing, shrinking, fattening, and 
slenderizing that if a man 
knew he wasn’t Baker, he had 
to doubt everybody and any- 
body else. 

Orders were to kill the first 
man who came up to Hastings 
at his table. He would have to 
shoot if it were his own father, 
or the director of the ETI, 
and there wasn’t too much dif- 
ference, he reflected. 

H e was seated where he 

could see both the en- 
trance and the door to the 
men’s room. Other agents 
were covering the back way. 
Baker would have to come 
from the tiered front. 

Would Thorsen be able to 
kill Baker? If he got off the 
first shot, he would. Evening 
fashions were too tight for 
meteor shields. If he were 
wearing an electronic cuirass, 
he could tell it immediately by 
the twin spheres that gave 
that football-shoulder effect. 
Moreover, had anyone entered 
wearing such obvious armor, 
it would have been flashed to 
him. In that case, a hand 
bomb would have to be used, 
which would be unfortunate 
for Hastings, and possibly 
Thorsen. 

Hastings wasn’t showing 
his fear — he had been doped 

JIM HARMON 



110 



to hide that — but he was grow- 
ing more alert. Baker must be 
coming ! 

Thorsen forced himself not 
to give things away by reach- 
ing for his weapon yet. He 
fastened his attention on the 
two doors into the cafe. 

The shot blew most of Thor- 
sen’s lungs away, but the elec- 
tronic wiring in his muscles 
kept the shock from killing 
him outright. He turned and 
managed to get off one shot 
before death started climbing 
up his arms from his fingers, 
and the weapon fell. 

He should have kept in mind 
that no one had ever seen 
Baker and lived to tell it. Now 
he had seen Baker and he was 
not going to live either. But 
then Baker was dead even now, 
in spite of Thorsen’s mistake. 

Before he died, Thorsen 
took one last look at the figure 
with the long golden hair ly- 
ing on the threshold of the 
ladies’ room. 

X 

“THIS STORY is absolutely 

authentic,” the director said. 
“Several ETI agents saw the 
whole thing. But somehow in 
the confusion somebody stole 
Baker’s body.” 

“Really, Director !” Street 
said. “You don’t actually be- 
lieve Baker was a woman.” 

“Are you suggesting a dis- 
guise?” 

“It had to be. Baker’s body 
disappeared by getting up and 

BAKER’S DOZENS 



walking away. The only way 
it could do that was for it to 
be armored. The only way 
Baker could get into that 
building was for his armor to 
be hidden. There was only one 
way he could hide the two 
spheres of electronic equip- 
ment necessary to project the 
cuirass field, and he couldn’t 
do it if he really had been a 
woman.” 

XI 

THE DIRECTOR leveled his 

gun at Street. 

“I am at last convinced that 
there is only one way in which 
you could be so certain that 
Baker is not dead. You know 
he is alive, and you know it 
because you are Baker.” 

“You are correct,” Street 
said. “I am the celebrated 
Robin Hood of space. It is too 
great an honor to deny.” 

“I will go into confinement 
for many years because of 
what I am about to do, but I 
must see the Galaxy rid of 
you.” 

The director fired the lethal 
charge at point-blank range 
and the tall man tumbled to 

j'l'J p fl 

“I had to do it,” the direc- 
tor said over the body. “It was 
well enough to frame you for 
Baker’s crimes due to your 
suspicious knowledge of him, 
but I didn’t know you were 
going to fail to protest, that 
you were going to go along 
with the lie. I couldn’t stand 

111 



another man living to take the 
honor for being Bakei*. There 
can be no living Baker but 
me*' 

XII 

THE TALL man rolled over 
on the floor and sat up. “Then 
you admit that you are Baker ? 
No, never mind firing again. 
[ am wearing meteor armor 
under my clothes. It's suffi- 
cient to stop a gun blast.” 
“You are a clever devil,” 
the director snarled. 

“A man has to be clever to 

“You are NOT Baker!” the 
director shrieked. “I am!” 
“Are you?” the tall man said 
superciliously. “Think why 
you came here. You’ve been 
working too hard, Director. 
You received too many stories 
about Baker. You began envy- 
ing him his freedom of move- 
ment. Soon you began think- 
ing you were Baker. Your 
analyst sent you to me, to 
make you see through this 
legend of Baker. It was to my 
advantage to do so.” 

The director wavered. “If 
I’m not Baker, who is?” 

“I told you,” the tall man 
said, drawing a gun and shoot- 
ing the director in the head. 
“I am.” 

He smiled down at the body. 
“You weren’t wearing armor, 
were you?” 

S TREET revei*sed the dial 
on his gun and shot the di- 
rector a second time. Quickly, 



he stirred from his paralysis. 

“Sorry I had to do that, Di- 
rector,” Street said, “but 1 
could see you were about to 
strangle me with naked hands. 
The important thing was to 
fix the idea firmly in your 
mind that I was Baker. If you 
thought I was, you would have 
to realize that you couldn’t 
be. ” 

“I do,” the director said 
miserably as he climbed to his 
feet and dusted off his 
breeches. “But if I’m not 
Baker and you’re not Baker, 
who is Baker?” 

“Director, just as telling 
your stories and hearing my 
answers to them cured you of 
believing you were Baker, the 
events of this story are de- 
signed to make someone re- 
member the true identity of 
Baker — that very person who 
now believ’^es in a different per- 
sonality of his own.” 

“Who is this person who is 
really Baker?” the director 
asked. 

“The 'person tvho is no 2 V 
reading this story," Street 
said. 

XIII 

“I’M AFRAID it won’t do, Mr. 

Street,” the editor of Man's 
True Space said across his 
desk. “It’s fiction. There can 
be only one Baker and tens of 
thousands would read the 
.story in my magazine.” 

“You are missing the point, 
Mr. Trent,” Street said. 
“There is only one manuscript 



112 



JIM HARMON 



and it is in your hands. You 
are Baker. ” 

“No,” Trent said. “No.” 

“Yes,” Street said relent- 
lessly. “Just as the director 
realized that he was not Baker, 
you must realize yoti are.” 

Trent lay back in his swivel, 
gasping. “All right, all right, 

I admit it. I am Baker.” 

“But you aren’t really, Mr. 
Trent,” Street said calmly. “I 
know you thought at one time 
you were Baker and then re- 
pressed the idea. But I knew 
at some future time the delu- 
sion might return and you 
would begin claiming to be 
Baker once more. As you said, 
there can only be one Baker. 
I am Baker.” 

“You lie,” Trent snarled. “I 
know the truth now. I am 
Baker, and there can only be 
one.” 

The editor jerked the gun 
up from his desk drawer. The 
shots crashed at the same in- 
stant. Trent ran the letter 
spindle through his chest as 
he fell across the desk. Street 
settled back into his chair 
comfortably, death in his 
lungs from the gas bullet that 
had exploded against his 
armor. 

XIV 

THE DIRECTOR of Extrater- 
restrial Investigations opened 
the closet door and stepped 
into the office. “The fools,” 
Baker said to himself. 

He had no doubt that he was 
the true, the original Baker. 



He remembered clearly that 
he had stepped out of the left 
cabinet of Gentle's transmat- 
ter, the one which he had fii*st 
entered. (He did remember 
that, didn’t he? Yes ! Doubting 
himself was the first stride 
down the road these two had 
taken.) His act to shock 
“Street” into realizing they 
were both Baker had been 
elaborate, but “Street” had 
gone schizoid. 

He was no copy, but there 
were copies of Baker, dozens 
of them, all helping the down- 
trodden aliens from terrestrial 
exploitation and making for- 
tunes for themselves. There 
were fat ones, thin ones, tall 
ones, short ones, all kinds of 
Bakers, thanks to the refine- 
ment of Gentle’s distortion 
factoi*s in matter-duplicating 
to an exact science, a desired 
result, not an accident like the 
duplication itself. Unfortu- 
nately, in a few, physical dis- 
tortion meant mental disorien- 
tation. These no longer had to 
merely pretend to be other 
people than Baker. 

It was too bad about them 
— and about all the other Bak- 
ers who had died. He really 
had died in all those ways on 
all those worlds in all those 
bodies, despite “Street’s” clev- 
er excuses. Still it wasn’t a bad 
life — helping the helpless and 
himself to all they could 
get. 

Yes, Baker decided, dying 
was a good way to make a 
living. END

Terror was eating at Sharp . 



a?id the more it fed, the more 



fiercely ravenous it became! 



T he analyst said; “I’m 
Humphry s, the man you 
came to see.” There were fear 
and hostility on the patient’s 
face, so Humphrys said: “I 
could tell a joke about ana- 
lysts. Would that make you 
feel better ? Or I could remind 
you that the National Health 
Trust is paying my fee; it’s 
not going to cost you a cent. 
Or I could cite the case of 
Psychoanalyst Y. who com- 
mitted suicide last year be- 



cause of overburdening anxi- 
ety resulting from a fraudu- 
lently filled out income tax.” 

Grudgingly, the patient 
smiled. “I heard about that. So 
psychologists are fallible.” He 
got to his feet and held out his 
hand. “My name is Paul 
Sharp. My secretary made the 
arrangements with you. I have 
a little problem, nothing im- 
portant, but I’d like to clear it 
up.” 

The expression on his face 



115 



showed that it was no small 
problem, and that, if he didn’t 
clear it up, it would probably 
destroy him. 

“Come inside,” Humphrys 
said genially, opening the door 
to his office, “so we can both 
sit down.” 

Sinking down in a soft easy 
chair. Sharp stretched his legs 

out in front of him. “No 
couch,” he observed. 

“The couch vanished back 
around 1980,” Humphrys 
said. “Post-war analysts feel 
enough confidence to face their 
patients on an equal level.” He 
offered a pack of cigarettes to 
Sharp and then lit up himself. 
“Your secretary gave me no 
details; she just said you 
wanted a conference.” 

Sharp said: “I can talk 
frankly?” 

“I’m bonded,” Humphrys 
said, with pride. “If any of the 
material you tell me gets into 
the hands of security organi- 
zations, I forfeit approximate- 
ly ten thousand dollars in 
Westbloc silver — hard cash, 
not paper stuff.” 

“That’s good enough for 
me,” Sharp said, and began. 
“I’m an economist, working 
for the Department of Agri- 
culture — the Division of War 
Destruction Salvage. I poke 
around H-bomb craters seeing 
what’s worth rebuilding.” He 
corrected himself. “Actually, 
I analyze reports on H-bomb 
craters and make recommen- 
dations. It was my recom- 
mendation to reclaim the farm 



lands around Sacramento and 
the industrial ring here at Los 
Angeles.” 

In spite of himself, Hum- 
phrys was impressed. Here 
was a man in the policy-plan- 
ning level of the Government. 
It gave him an odd feeling to 
realize that Sharp, like any 
other anxiety-ridden citizen, 
had come to the Psych Front 
for therapy. 

* “My sister-in-law got a nice 
advantage from the Sacra- 
mento reclamation,” Hum- 
phrys commented. “She had a 
small walnut orchard up 
there. The Government hauled 
off the ash, rebuilt the house 
and outbuildings, even staked 
her to a few dozen new trees. 
Except for her leg injury, 
she’s as well off as before the 
war.” 

“We’re pleased with our 
Sacramento project,” Sharp 
said. He had begun to per- 
spire; his smooth, pale fore- 
head was streaked, and his 
hands, as he held his cigarette, 
shook. “Of course, I have a 
personal interest in Northern 
California. I was born there 
myself, up around Petaluma, 
where they used to turn out 
hens’ eggs by the million . .” 
His voice trailed off huskily. 
“Humphrys,” he muttered, 
“what am I going to do?” 

“First,” Humphrys said, 
“give me more information.” 

“I — ” Sharp grinned inane- 
ly. “I have some kind of hallu- 
cination. I’ve had it for years, 
but it’s getting worse. I’ve 



116 



PHILIP K. DICK 



tried to shake it, but — ” he 
gestured — “it comes back, 
stronger, bigger, more often.” 
Beside Humphiys’ desk, the 
vid and aud recorders were 
scanning covertly. “Tell me 
what the hallucination is,” he 
instructed. “Then maybe I can 
tell you why you have it.” 

H e was tired. In the 

privacy of his living 
room, he sat dullj’^ examining 
a series of reports on carrot 
mutation. A variety, external- 
ly indistinguishable from the 
norm, was sending people in 
Oregon and Mississippi to 
the hospital with convulsions, 
fever and partial blindness. 
Why Oregon and Mississippi? 
Here with the report were 
photographs of the feral mu- 
tation ; it did look like an ordi- 
nary carrot. And with the 
report came an exhaustive 
analysis of the toxic agent 
and recommendation for a 
neutralizing antidote. 

Sharp wearily tossed the re- 
jwrt aside and selected the 
next in order. 

According to the second re- 
port, the notorious Detroit rat 
had shown up in St. Louis and 
Chicago, infesting the indus- 
trial and agricultural settle- 
ments replacing the destroyed 
c ities. The Detroit rat — he had 
seen one once. That was three 
years ago; coming home one 
night, he had unlocked the 
door and seen, in the darkness, 
something scuttle away to 
safety. Arming himself with a 

RECALL MECHANISM 



hammer, he had pushed furni- 
ture around until he found it. 
The rat, huge and gray, had 
been in the process of building 
itself a wall-to-wall web. As it 
leaped up, he killed it with the 
hammer. A rat that spun 
webs . 

He called an official exter- 
minator and reported its pres- 
ence. * 

A Special Talents Agency 
had been set up by the Gov- 
ernment to utilize parabilities 
of wartime mutants evolved 
from the various radiation- 
saturated areas. But, he re- 
flected, the Agency w'as 
equipped to handle only hu- 
man mutants and their tele- 
pathic, precog, parakinetic 
and related abilities. There 
should have been a Special 
Talents Agency for vegetables 
and rodents, too. 

From behind his chair came 
a stealthy sound. Turning 
quickly. Sharp found himself 
facing a tall, thin man w^ear- 
ing a drab raincoat and smok- 
ing a cigar. 

“Did I scare you?” Giller 
asked, and snickered. “Take it 
easy, Paul. You look as if 
you’re going to pass out.” 

“I was working,” Sharp 
said defensively, partially re- 
covering his equilibrium. 

“So I see,” said Giller. 
“And thinking about rats.” 
Sharp pushed his w'ork to one 
side. “How’d you get in?” 
“Your door was unlocked.” 
Giller removed his raincoat 
and tossed it on the couch.

“That’s right — you killed a 
Detroit. Right here in this 
room.” He gazed around the 
neat, unostentatious living 
room. “Are those things 
fatal?” 

“Depends where they get 
you.” Going into the kitchen, 
Sharp found two beers in the 
refrigerator. As he poured, he 
said: “They shouldn’t waste 
grain making this stuff . but 
as long as they do, it’s a shame 
not to drink it.” 

Giller accepted his beer 
greedily. “Must be nice to be 
a big \yheel and have luxuries 
like this.” His small, dark eyes 
roved speculatively around the 
kitchen. “Your own stove, 
and your owm refrigerator.” 
Smacking his lips, he added : 
“And beer. I haven’t had a 
beer since last August.” 

“You’ll live,” Sharp said, 
without compassion. “Is this 
a business call? If so, get to 
the point; I’ve got plenty of 
work to do.” 

G iller said: “I just want- 
ed to say hello to a fellow 
Petaluman.” 

Wincing, Sharp answered: 
“It sounds like some sort of 
synthetic fuel.” 

Giller wasn’t amused. “Are 
you ashamed to have come 
from the very section that 
was once — ” 

“I know. The egg-laying 
capital of the universe. Some- 
times I wonder — how many 
chicken feathers do you sup- 
pose were drifting around, the 



day the first H-bomb hit our 
town ?” 

“Billions,” Giller said mo- 
rosely. “And some of them 
were mine. My chickens, I 
mean. Your family had a 
farm, didn’t they?” 

“No,” Sharp said, refusing 
to be identified with Giller. 
“My family operated a drug 
store facing on Highway 101. 
A block from the park, near 
the sporting goods shop.” And, 
he added under his breath: 
You can go to hell. Because 
I’m not going to change my 
mind. You can camp on my 
doorstep the rest of your life 
and it still won’t do any good. 
Petaluma isn’t that important. 
And anyhow, the chickens are 
dead. 

“How’s the Sac rebuild com- 
ing?” Giller inquired. 

“Fine.” 

“Plenty of those walnuts 

again?” 

“Walnuts coming out of 
people’s ears.” 

“Mice getting in the shell 
heaps?” 

“Thousands of them.” Sharp 
sipped his beer; it was good 
quality, probably as good as 
pre-war. He wouldn’t know, 
because in 1961, the year the 
war broke out, he had been 
only six years old. But the beer 
tasted the way he remembered 
the old days : opulent and 
carefree and satisfying. 

“We figure,” Giller said 
hoarsely, an avid gleam in his 
face, “that the Petaluma- 
Sonoma area can be built up 

PHILIP K. DICK 



118 



again for about seven billion 
Westbloc. That’s nothing com- 
pared to what you’ve been dol- 
ing out.” 

“And the Petaluma-Sonoma 
area is nothing compared with 
the areas we’ve been rebuild- 
ing,” Sharp said. “You think 
we need eggs and wine? What 
we need is machinery. It’s 
Chicago and Pittsburgh and 
Los Angeles and St. Louis 
and — ” 

“You’ve forgotten,” Giller 
droned on, “that you’re a 
Petaluman. You’re turning 
your back on your origin — and 
on your duty.” 

“Duty! You suppose the 
Government hired me to be a 
lobbyist for one trivial farm 
area?” Shai^) flushed with 
outrage. “As far as I’m con- 
cerned — ” 

“We’re your people,” Giller 
said inflexibly. “And your peo- 
ple come first.” 

When he had got rid of the 
man. Sharp stood for a time 
in the night darkness, gazing 
down the road after Giller’s 
receding car. Well, he said to 
himself, there goes the way of 
the world — me first and to hell 
with everybody else. 

Sighing, he turned and 
made his way up the path to- 
ward the front porch of his 
house. Lights gleamed friend- 

lily in the window. Shivering, 
he put his hand out and groped 
for the railing. 

And then, as he clumsily ’ 
mounted the stairs, the terri- 
ble thing happened. 



W ITH A RUSH, the lights 

of the window winked 
out. The porch railing dissolv- 
ed under his fingers. In his 
ears a shrill screaming whine 
rose up and deafened him. He 
was falling. Struggling fran- 
tically, he tried to get hold of 
something, but there was only 
empty darkness around him, 
no substance, no reality, only 
the depth beneath him and the 
din of his own terrified 
shrieks. 

“Help !” he shouted, and the 
sound beat futilely back at 
him. “I’m falling!” 

And then, gasping, he was 
outstretched on the damp 
lawn, clutching handfuls of 
grass and dirt. Two feet from 
the porch — he had missed the 
first step in the darkness and 
had slipped and fallen. An or- 
dinary event : the window 

lights had been blocked by the 
concrete railing. The whole 
thing had happened in a split 
second and he had fallen only 
the length of his own body. 
There was blood on his fore- 
head ; he had cut himself as he 

st/1* 1.1 ck 

Silly. A childish, infuriat- 
ing event. 

Shakily, he climbed to his 
feet and mounted the steps. 
Inside the house, he stood 
leaning against the wall, shud- 
dering and panting. Gradually 
the fear faded out and ration- 
ality returned. 

_ 

Whj/ was he so afraid of 
falling ? 

Something had to be done. 



119 



RECALL MECHANISM 



This was worse than ever be- 
fore, even worse than the time 
he had stumbled coming out of 
the elevator at the office — and 
had instantly been reduced to 
screaming terror in front of a 
lobbyful of people. 

What would happen to him 
if he really fell? If, for ex- 
ample, he were to step off one 
of the overhead ramps con- 
necting the maj or Los Angeles 
office buildings? The fall would 
be stopped by safety screens; 
no physical harm was ever 
done, though people fell all the 
time. But for him — the psy- 
chological shock might be 
fatal. Would be fatal; to his 
mind, at least. 

He made a mental note : no 
more going out on the ramps. 
Under no circumstances. He 
had been avoiding them for 
years, but from now on, ramps 
were in the same class as air 
travel. Since 1982 he hadn’t 
left the surface of the planet. 
And, in the last few years, he 
seldom visited offices more 
than ten flights up. 

But if he stopped using the 
ramps, how was he going to 
get into his own research files? 
The file room was accessible 
only by ramp : the narrow 
metallic path leading up from 
the office area. 

Perspiring, teiTified, he 
sank down on the couch and 
sat huddled over, wondering 
how he was going to keep his 
job, do his work. 

And how he was going to 
stay alive. 

120 



HUMPHRYS waited, but his 
patient seemed to have fin- 
ished. 

“Does it make you feel any 
better,” Humphrys asked, “to 
know that fear of falling is a 
common phobia?” 

“No,” Sharp answered. 

“I guess there’s no reason 
why it should. You say it’s 
shown up before? When was 
the first time?” 

“When I was eight. The war 
had been going on two years. 1 
was on the surface, examining 
my vegetable garden.” Sharp 
smiled weakly. “Even when 1 
was a kid, I grew things. The 
San Francisco network picked 
up exhaust trails of a Soviet 
missile and all the warning 
towers went off like Roman 
candles. I was almost on top of 
the shelter. I raced to it, lifted 
the lid and started down the 
stairs. At the bottom were my 
mother and father. They yell- 
ed for me to hurry. I started 
to run down the stairs.” 

“And fell ?” Humphrys ask- 
ed expectantly. 

“I didn’t fall ; I suddenly got 
afraid. I couldn’t go any far- 
ther; I just stood there. And 
they were yelling up at me. 
They wanted to get the bottom 
plate screwed in place. And 
they couldn’t until I was 
down.” 

W ITH A TOUCH of aver- 
sion, Humphrys acknowl- 
edged : “I remember those old 
two-stage shelters. I wonder 
how many people got shut be- 



PHILIP K. DICK 



tween the lid and the bottom 
plate.” He eyed his patient. 
“As a child, had you heard of 
that happening? People being 
trapped on the stairs, not able 
to get back up, not able to get 
down ...” 

“I wasn’t scared of being 
trapped! 1 was scared of fall- 
ing — afraid I’d pitch head- 
forward off the steps.” Sharp 
licked his di*y lips. “Well, so I 
turned around — ” His body 
shuddered. “1 went back up 
and outside.” 

“During the attack?” 

“They shot down the mis- 
sile. But I spent the alert tend- 
ing my vegetables. Afterward, 
my family beat me nearly un- 
conscious.” 

Humphrys’ mind formed 
the words : origin of guilt. 

“The next time,” Sharp con- 
tinued, “was when I was four- 
teen. The war had been over a 
few months. We started back 
to see what was left of our 
town. Nothing was left, only a 
crater of radioactive slag sev- 
eral hundred feet deep. Work 
teams were creeping down 
into the crater. I stood on the 
edge watching them. The fear 
came.” He put out his ciga- 
rette and sat waiting until the 
analyst found him another. “I 
left the area after that. Every 

night I dreamed about that 

crater, that big dead mouth. I 
hitched a ride on a military 
truck and rode to San Fran- 
cisco.” 

“When was the next time?” 
asked Humphrys. 



Irritably, Sharp said : “Then 
it happened all the time, every 
time I was up high, every time 
I had to walk up or down a 
flight of steps — any situation 
where I was high and might 
fall. But to be afraid to walk 
up the steps of my own 
house — ” He broke off tempo- 
rarily. “I can’t walk up three 
steps,” he said wretchedly. 
“Three concrete steps.” 

“Any particularly bad epi- 
sodes, outside of those you’ve 
mentioned ?” 

“I was in love with a pretty 
brown-haired girl who lived 
on the top floor of the Atche- 
son Apartments. Probably she 
still lives there ; I wouldn’t 
know. I got five or six floors up 
and then — I told her good 
night and came back down.” 
Ironically, he said : “She must 
have thought I was crazy.” 

“Others?” Humphrys ask- 
ed, mentally noting the ap- 
pearance of the sexual ele- 
ment. 

“One time I couldn’t accept 
a job because it involved 
travel by air. It had to do with 
inspecting agricultural proj- 
ects.” 

Humphrys said : “In the old 
days, analysts looked for the 
origin of a phobia. Now we 
ask : what does it do ? Usually 
it gets the individual out of 
situations he unconsciously 
dislikes.” 

A slow, disgusted flush ap- 
peared on Sharp’s face. “Can’t 
you do better than that?” 

Disconcerted, Humphrys 

121 



RECALL MECHANISM 



murmured; “I don’t say I 
agree with the theory or that 
it’s necessarily true in your 
case. I’ll say this much, 
though : it’s not falling you’re 
afraid of. It’s something that 
falling reminds you of. With 
luck we ought to be able to dig 
up the prototype experience — 
what they used to call the 
original traumatic incident.” 
Getting to his feet, he began 
to drag over a stemmed tower 
of electronic mirrors. “My 
lamp,” he explained. “It’ll 
melt the barriers.” 

Sharp regarded the lamp 
with apprehension. “Look,” he 
muttered nervously, “I don’t 
want my mind reconstructed. 
I may be a neurotic, but I take 
pride in my personality.” 
“This won’t affect your per- 
sonality.” Bending down, 
Humphrys plugged in the 
lamp. “It will bring up mate- 
rial not accessible to your ra- 
tional center. I’m going to 
trace your life-track back to 
the incident at which vou were 
done great harm — and find out 
what you’re really afraid of.” 

B lack shapes drifted 

around him. Sharp scream- 
ed and struggled wildly, trying 
to pry loose the fingers closing 
over his arms and legs. Some- 
thing smashed against his 
face. Coughing, he slumped 
forAvard, dribbling blood and 
saliva and bits of broken teeth, 
F«r an instant, blinding light 
flashed; he was being scruti- 
nized. 



“Is he dead?” a voice de- 
manded. 

“Not yet.” A foot poked ex- 
perimentally into Sharp’s side. 
Dimly, in his half-conscious- 
ness, he could hear ribs crack- 
ing. “Almost, though.” 

“Can you hear me. Sharp?” 
a voice rasped, close to his ear. 

He didn’t respond. He lay 
trying not to die, trying not to 
associate himself with the 
cracked and broken thing that 
had been his body. 

“You probably imagine,” 
the voice said, familiar, inti- 
mate, “that' I’m going to say 
you’ve got one last chance. But 
you don’t. Sharp. Your chance 
is gone. I’m telling you what 
we’re going to do with you.” 

Gasping, he tried not to 
hear. And, futilely, he tried 
not to feel what they were sys- 
tematically doing to him. 

“All right,” the familiar 
voice said finally, when it had 
been done. “Now throw him 
out.” 

What remained of Paul 
Sharp was lugged to a circu- 
lar hatch. The nebulous out- 
line of darkness rose up 
around him and then — hide- 
ously — he was pitched into it. 
Down he fell, but this time he 
didn’t scream. 

No physical apparatus re- 
mained with which to scream. 

SNAPPING the lamp off, 
Humphrys bent over and me- 
thodically roused the slumped 
figure. 

“Sharp!” he ordered loudly.

‘‘Wake up! Come out of it!” 

The man gj-oaned, blinked 
his eyes, stirred. Over his face 
settled a glaze of pure, unmiti- 
gated toiment. 

“God,” he whispered, eyes 
blank, body limp with sulfer- 
ing. “Thej'^ — ” 

“You’re back here,” Hum- 
phrys said, shaken by w’hat 
had been dredged up. “There’s 
nothing to worry about ; you’re 
absolutely safe. It’s over with 
— happened years ago.” 

“Over,” Sharp murmured 
pathetically. 

“You’re back in the present. 
Understand ?” 

“Yes,” Sharp muttered. 
“But — what was it? They 
pushed me out — through and 
into something. And I went on 
down.” He trembled violently. 
“I fell.” 

“You fell through a hatch,” 
Humphrys told him calmly. 
“You were beaten up and bad- 
ly injured — fatally, they as- 
sumed. But you did survive. 
You are alive. You got out of 

it.” 

“Why did they do it?” Sharp 
asked brokenly. His face, sag- 
ging and gray, twitched with 
despair. “Help me, Hum- 
phrys ...” 

“Consciously, you don’t re- 
member when it happened?” 

“No.” 

“Do you remember where?” 

“No.” Sharp’s face jerked 
spasmodically. “They tried to 
kill me — they did kill me!” 
Struggling upright, he pro- 
tested: “Nothing like that

happened to me. I’d remember 
if it had. It’s a false memory 
— my mind’s been tampei cd 
W'ith!” 

“It’s been repressed,” Hum- 
phrys said firmly, “deeply bur- 
ied because of the pain and 
shock. A form of amnesia — 
it’s been liltering indirectly up 
in the form of your phobia. 
But now that you recall it 
consciously — ” 

“Do I have to go back?” 
Sharp’s voice rose hysterical- 
ly. “Do I have to get under 
that damn lamp again?” 

“It’s got to come out on a 
conscious level,” Humphrys 
told him, “but not all at once. 
You’ve had your limit for to- 
day.” 

Sagging with relief. Sharp 
settled back in the chair. 
“Thanks,” he said weakly. 
Touching his face, his body, he 
whispered: “I’ve been carry- 
ing that in my mind all 
these years. Corroding, eating 
away — ” 

“There should be some dim- 
inution of the phobia,” the 
analyst told him, “as you 
grapple with the incident it- 
self. We’ve made progress ; we 
now have some idea of the 
real fear. It involves bodily 
injury at the hands of profes- 
sional criminals. Ex-soldiers 
in the early post-v/ar years 
. gangs of bandits. I remem- 
ber.” 

A measure of confidence re- 
turned to Sharp. “It isn’t 
hard to understand a falling 
fear, under the circumstances. 

123 



Considering what happened to 
me . Shakily, he started to 
his feet. 

And screamed shrilly. 

“What is it?” Humphiys 
demanded, hastily coming over 
and grabbing hold of his arm. 
Sharp leaped violently away, 
staggered, and collapsed inert- 
ly in the chair. “What hap- 
pened ?” 

Face working. Sharp man- 
aged: “I can’t get up.” 

“What?” 

“I can’t stand up.” Implor- 
ingly, he gazed up at the ana- 
lyst, striken and terrified. 
“I’m — afraid I’ll fall. Doctor, 
now I can’t even get to my 
feet.” 

■CK)R AN interval neither 
■T man spoke. Finally, his 
eyes on the floor. Sharp whis- 
pered : “The reason I came to 
you, Humphrys, is because 
your office is on the ground 
floor. That’s a laugh, isn’t it? I 
couldn’t go any higher.” 

“We’re going to have to 
turn the lamp back on you,” 
Humphrys said. 

“I realize it. I’m scared.” 
Gripping the arms of the 
chair, he continued: “Go 

ahead. What else can we do ? I 
can’t leave here. Humphrys, 
this thing is going to kill me.” 

“No, it isn’t.” Humphrys 
got the lamp into position. 
“We’ll get you out of this. Try 
to relax ; try to think of noth- 
ing in particular.” Clicking 
the mechanism on, he said 

softly: “This time I don’t 



want the traumatic incident 
itself. I want the envelope of 
experience that surrounds it. I 
want the broader segment of 
which it’s a part.” 

PAUL SHARP walked quietly 
through the snow. His breath, 
in front of him, billowed out- 
ward and formed a sparkling 
cloud of white. To his left lay 
the jagged ruins of what had 
been buildings. The ruins, cov- 
ered with snow, seemed almost 
lovely. For a moment he paus- 
ed, entranced. 

“Interesting,” a member of 
his research team observed, 
coming up. “Could be any- 
thing — absolutely anything — 
under there.” 

“It’s beautiful, in a way,” 
Sharp commented. 

“See that spire?” The young 
man pointed with one heavily 
gloved finger ; he still wore his 
lead-shielded suit. He and his 
group had been poking around 
the still-contaminated crater. 
Their boring bars were lined 
up in an orderly row. “That 
was a church,” he informed 
Shai*p. “A nice one, by the 
looks of it. And over there — ” 
he indicated an indiscriminate 
jumble of ruin — “that was the 
main civic center.” 

“The city wasn’t directly 
hit, was it?” Sharp asked. 

“It was bracketed. Come on 
down and see what we’ve run 
into. The crater to our 
right — ” 

“No, thanks,” Sharp said, 
pulling back with intense 



124 



PHILIP K. DICK 



aversion, “ril let you do the 
crawling around.” 

The youthful expert glanced 
curiously at Sharp, then for- 
got the matter. “Unless we 
run into something unexpect- 
ed, we should be able to start 
reclamation within a week. 
The first step, of course, is to 
clear off the slag-layer. It’s 
fairly well cracked — a lot of 
plant growth has perforated 
it, and natural decay has re- 
duced a great deal of it to 
semi-organic ash.” 

“Fine,” Sharp said, with 
satisfaction. “I’ll be glad to 
see something here again, 
after all these years.” 

The expert asked: “What 
was it like before the war? I 
never saw that; I was born 
after the destruction began.” 
“Well,” Sharp said, survey- 
ing the fields of snow, “this 
was a thriving agricultural 
center. They grew grapefruit 
here. Arizona grapefruit. The 
Roosevelt Dam was along this 
way.” 

“Yes,” the expert said, nod- 
ding. “We located the rem- 
nants of it.” 

“Cotton was grown here. So 
was lettuce, alfalfa, grapes, 
olives, apricots — the thing I 
remember most, the time I 
came through Phoenix with 
my family, was the eucalyptus 
trees.” 

“We won’t have all that 
back,” the expert said regret- 
fully. “What the heck — euca- 
lyptus? I never heard of that.” 
“There aren’t any left in the 



United States,” Sharp said. 
“You’d have to go to Aus- 
tralia.” 

LISTENING, Humphrys jot- 
ted down a notation. “Okay,” 
he said aloud, switching off the 
lamp. “Come back. Sharp.” 
With a grunt, Paul Sharp 
blinked and opened his eyes. 
“What — ” Struggling up, he 
yawned, stretched, peered 
blankly around the office. 
“Something about reclama- 
tion. I was supervising a team 
of recon men. A young kid.” 
“When did you reclaim 
Phoenix?” Humphrys asked. 
“That seems to be included in 
the vital time-space segment.” 
Sharp frowned. “We never 
reclaimed Phoenix. That’s still 
projected. We hope to get at it 
sometime in the next year.” 
“Are you positive?” 
“Naturally. That’s my job.” 
“I’m going to have to send 
you back,” Humphrys said, al- 
ready reaching for the lamp. 
“What happened?” 

The lamp came on. “Relax,” 
Humphrys instructed briskly, 
a trifle too briskly for a man 
supposed to know exactly what 
he was doing. Forcing himself 
to slow down, he said care- 
fully: “I want your perspec- 
tive to broaden. Take in an 
earlier incident, one preceding 
the Phoenix reclamation.” 

I N AN inexpensive cafeteria 
in the business district, two 
men sat facing each other 
across a table.

“Pm sorry,” Paul Sharp 
said, with impatience. “Fve 
got to get back to my work.” 
Picking up his cup of ersatz 
coffee, he gulped the contents 
down. 

The tall, thin man carefully 
pushed away his empty dishes 
and, leaning back, lit a cigar. 

“For two years,” Giller said 
bluntly, “you’ve been giving us 
the runaround. Frankly, I’m a 
little tired of it.” 

“Runaround ?” Sharp had 
started to rise. “I don’t get 
your drift.” 

“You’re going to reclaim an 
agricultural area — you’re go- 
ing to tackle Phoenix. So don’t 
tell me you’re sticking to in- 
dustrial. Ho^v long do you 
imagine those people are going 
to keep on living? Unless you 
reclaim their farnis and 
lands—” 

“What people?” 

Harshly, Giller said : “The 
people living at Petaluma. 
Camped around the craters.” 

With vague dismay. Sharp 
murmured: “I didn’t realize 
there was anybody living 
there. I thought j'^ou all headed 
for the nearest reclaimed re- 
gions, San Francisco and Sac- 
ramento.” 

“You never read the peti- 
tions we presented,” Giller 
said softly. 

Sharp colored. “No, as a 
matter of fact. Whv should I ? 
If there’re people camping in 
the slag, it doesn’t alter the 
basic situation ; you should 
leave, get out of there. That 



area is through.” He added : 
“I got out.” 

Vei*y quietly, Giller said: 
“You would have stuck around 
if you’d farmed there. If your 
family had farmed there for 
over a century. It’s different 
from running a drug store. 
Drug stores are the same 
everywhere in the world.” 

“So are farms.” 

“No,” Giller said dispassion- 
ately. “Your land, your fam- 
ily’s land, has a unique feeling. 
We’ll keep on camping there 
until we’re dead or until you 
decide to reclaim.” Mechani- 
cally collecting the checks, he 
finished: “I’m sorry for you, 
Paul. You never had roots like 
we have. And I’m sorry you 
can’t be made to understand.” 
As he reached into his coat for 
his wallet, he asked: “When 
can you fly out there ?” 

“Fly!” Sharp echoed, shud- 
dering. “I’m not flying any- 
where.” 

“You’ve got to see the town 
again. You can’t decide with- 
out having seen those people, 
seen how they’re living.” 

“No,” Sharp said emphati- 
cally. “I’m not flying out there. 
I can decide on the basis of re- 
ports.” 

Giller considered. “You’ll 
come,” he declared. 

“Over my dead body !” 

Giller nodded. “Maybe so. 
But you’re going to come. You 
can’t let us die without looking 
at us. You’ve got to have the 
courage to see what it is you’re 
doing.” He got out a pocket

calendar and scratched a mark 
by one of the dates. Tossing it 
across the table to Sharp, he 
informed him : “VVe’ll come by 
your office and pick you up. 
We have the plane we flew 
down here. It’s mine. It’s a 
sweet ship.” 

Trembling, Sharp examined 
the calendar. And, standing 
over his mumbling, supine pa- 
tient, so did Humphrys. 

He had been right. Sharp’s 
traumatic incident, the re- 
pressed material, didn’t lie in 
the past. 

Sharp was suffering from a 
phobia based on an event six 
months in the future. 

YOU get up?” Hum- 
^ phrys inquired. 

In the chair, Paul Sharp 
stirred feebly. “I — ” he began, 
and then sank into silence. 

“No more for a while,” 
Humphreys told him reassur- 
ingly. “You’ve had enough. 
But I wanted to get you away 
from the trauma itself.” 

“I feel better now.” 

“Try to stand.” Humphrys 
approached and stood waiting, 
as the man crept unsteadily to 
his fG6t, 

“Yes,” Sharp breathed. “It 
has receded. What was that 
last? I was in a cafe or some- 
thing. With Giller.” 

Prom his desk Humphrys 
got a prescription pad. “I’m 
going to write you out a little 

comfort. Some round white 
pills to take every four hours.” 
He scribbled and then handed 



the slip to his patient. “So you 
will relax. It’ll take awav 
some of the tension.” 

“Thanks,” Sharp said, in a 
weak, almost inaudible voice. 
Presently, he asked : “A lot of 
material came up, didn’t it?” 

“It certainly did,” Hum- 
phrys admitted tightly. 

There was nothing he could 
do for Paul Sharp. The man 
was ver>’ close to death now — 
in six short months, Giller 
would go to work on him. And 
it was too bad, because Sharp 
was a nice guy, a nice, con- 
scientious, hard-working bu- 
reaucrat who was only trying 
to do his job as he saw it. 

“What do you think?” Sharp 
asked pathetically. “Can you 
help me?” 

“I’ll — try,” Humphiys an- 
swered, not able to look direct- 
ly at him. “But it goes very 
deep.” 

“It’s been a long time grow- 
ing,” Sharp admitted humbly. 
Standing by the chair, he 
seemed small and forlorn ; not 
an important official but only 
one isolated, unprotected indi- 
vidual. “I’d sure appreciate 
your help. If this phobia keeps 
up, no telling where it’ll end.” 

Humphrys asked suddenly, 
“Would you consider changing 
your mind and granting Cil- 
ler’s demands?” 

“I can’t,” Shall) said. “It’s 
bad policy. I’m opposed to spe- 
cial pleading, and that’s what 
it is.” 

“Even if you come from the 
area? Even if the people are

friends and former neighbors 
of yours?" 

“It’s my job,” Sharp said. 
“I have to do it without regard 
for my feelings or anybody 
else’s.” 

“You’re not a bad fellow,” 
Humphrys said involuntarily. 
“I’m sorry — ” He broke off. 

“Sorry what?” Sharp moved 
mechanically toward the exit 
door. “I’ve taken enough of 
your time. I realize how busy 
you analysts are. When shall I 
come back? Can I come back?” 

“Tomorrow.” Humphrys 
guided him outside and into 
the corridor. “About this same 
time, if it’s convenient.” 

“Thanks a lot,” Sharp said, 
with relief. “I really appreci- 
ate it . ” 

A S SOON as he was alone in 

his office, Humphrys clos- 
ed the door and strode back to 
his desk. Reaching down, he 
grabbed the telephone and un- 
steadily dialed. 

“Give me somebody on your 
medical staff,” he ordered 
curtly when he had been con- 
nected with the Special Tal- 
ents Agency. 

“This is Kirby,” a profes- 
sional-sounding voice came 
presently. “Medical research.” 
Humphrys briefly identified 
himself. “I have a patient 
here,” he said, “who seems to 
be a latent precog.” 

Kirby was interested, 
“What area does he come 
from?” 

“Petaluma. Sonoma County, 



north of San Francisco Bay. 
It’s east of — ” 

“We’re familiar with the 
area. A number of precogs 
have showed up there. That’s 
been a gold mine for us.” 
“Then I was right,” Hum- 
phrys said. 

“What’s the date of the pa- 
tient’s birth?” 

“He was six years old when 
the war began.” 

“Well,” Kirby said, disap- 
pointed, “then he didn’t really 
get enough of a dose. He’ll 
never develop a full precog 
talent, such as we work with 
here.” 

“In other words, you won’t 
help ?” 

“Latents — people with a 
touch of it — outnumber the 
real carriers. We don’t have 
time to fool with them. You’ll 
probably run into dozens like 
your patient, if you stir 
around. When it’s imperfect, 
the talent isn’t valuable; it’s 
going to be a nuisance for the 
man, probably nothing else.” 
“Yes, it’s a nuisance,” Hum- 
phrys agreed caustically. “The 
man is only months away from 
a violent death. Since he was a 
child, he’s been getting ad- 
vanced phobic warnings. As 

the event gets closer, the reac- 
tions intensify.” 

“He’s not conscious of the 
future material?” 

“It operates strictly on a 
sub-rational level.” 

“Under the circumstances,” 
Kirby said thoughtfully, “may- 
be it’s just as well. These

things appear to be fixed. If he 
knew about it, he still couldn’t 
change it.” 

D r. CHARLES BAMBERG, 

consulting psychiatrist, 
was just leaving his office 
when he noticed a man sitting 
in the waiting room. 

Odd, Bamberg thought. 1 
have no patients left for today. 

Opening the door, he step- 
ped into the waiting room. 
“Did you wish to see me?” 
The man sitting on the chair 
was tall and thin. He wore a 
wrinkled tan raincoat, and, as 
Bamberg appeared, he began 
tensely stubbing out a cigar. 

“Yes,” he said, getting 
clumsilv to his feet. 

“Do you have an appoint- 
ment?” 

“No appointment.” The man 
gazed at him in appeal. “I 
picked you — ” He laughed 
with confusion. “Well, you’re 
on the top floor.” 

“The top floor?” Bamberg 
was intrigued. “What’s that 
got to do with it?” 

“I — well. Doc, I feel much 
more comfortable when I’m 
up high.” 

“I see,” Bamberg said. A 
compulsion, he thought to him- 
self. Fascinating. “And,” he 
said aloud, “when you’re up 
high, how do you feel? Bet- 
ter?” 

“Not better,” the man an- 
swered. “Can I come in? Do 
you have a second to spare 
me?” 

Bamberg looked at his 



watch. “All right,” he agreed, 
admitting the man. “Sit down 
and tell me about it.” 
Gratefully, Giller seated 
himself. “It interferes with 
my life,” he said rapidly, jerk- 
ily. “Every time I see a flight 
of stairs, I have an irresistible 
compulsion to go up it. And 
plane flight — I’m always fly- 
ing around. I have my own 
ship ; I can’t afford it, but I’ve 
got to have it.” 

“I see,” Bamberg said. 
“Well,” he continued genially, 
“that’s not really so bad. 
After all, it isn’t exactly a 
fatal compulsion.” 

Helplessly, Giller replied : 
“When I’m up there — ” He 
swallowed wretchedly, his 
dark eyes gleaming. “Doctor, 
w'hen I’m up high, in an office 
building, or in my plane— I 
feel another compulsion.” 
“What is it?” 

“I—” Giller shuddered, “I 
have an irresistible urge to 
push people.” 

“To push people?” 

“Toward windows. Out.” 
Giller made a gesture. “What 
am I going to do, Doc? I’m 
afraid I’ll kill somebody. There 
w^as a little shrimp of a guy I 
pushed once — and one day a 
girl was standing ahead of me 
on an escalator — I shoved her. 
She was injured.” 

“I see,” Bamberg said, nod- 
ding. Repressed hostility, he 
thought to himself. Inter- 
woven with sex. Not unusual. 
He reached for his lamp.
