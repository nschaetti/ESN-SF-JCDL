Lovecraft Lives! 

— mainly because the stories he 
wrote and the concepts he invented 
are too gripping to stop reading 
... or to stop writing. The roster 
of writers who have carried on 
Lovecraft’s characters and ideas is 
a Who’s Who of fantasy greats— 
August Derleth, Robert Bloch, 
Frank Belknap Long, Colin Wil- 
son, Clark Ashton Smith, Henry 
Kuttner. 

Beagle’s ARKHAM EDITIONS 
now include works by these 
authors as well as HPL— and this 



month’s offering is a prime pair 
from Derleth, The Mask of 
Cthulhu and The Trail of Cthulhu—a story collection and a novel about 
hapless mortals’ involvement with the terrifying beings from between the 
dimensions— Cthulhu, Hastur the Unspeakable, Ying, the amorphous flute- 
player, and the Goat with the Thousand Young. 



And next month, we’ll have what is probably Lovecraft’s solidest novel. 
The Case of Charles Dexter Ward. 



Goulartifice 

—a new noun, or Beaglism, to use as a label 
for Ron Goulart’s acid zaniness and what 
the New York Times calls his “bleak but 
bracing humor.’’ Death Cell is the first 
novel dealing with Jack Summer of Muck- 
rake, the galactic newsmag— a first-rate 
Goulartifact.

UNLESS WE FEAR SOME EVIL . 

The central theme of Robert A. 
Heinlein’s / Will Fear No Evil con- 
tinues to evoke its uniquely val- 
id echoes of matters at hand 
and things to come. Thus Give a 
Gift of Life is the newest game 
and yours or mine may be the 
name. 

Every player has a chance. No 
strings to Giver or Receiver. The 
Gift is made at your convenience 
— when you no longer need the 
item. Or is not made. You don’t 
have to change your vote, your 
last will and testament, your friend- 
ships, dress style or length of 
hair in order to play. Without 
penalty and at any time, you may 
quit playing. Here’s the scoop: 

Mr. James Pendzick, computer 
programer/analyst at the Univer- 
sity of Wisconsin and candidate 
for a Master’s in mathematics, 
writes: “I have been a reader of 
your magazine on and off for sev- 
eral years, but it was Heinlein’s 
/ Will Fear No Evil that got me to 
subscribe. I am writing this in di- 
rect response to a line from your 
April (’71) Letters 2 column: The 
National Rare Blood Club reports 
an unusually impressive response 
from your ranks . ’ I would like 
to request equal time for the Na- 
tional Kidney Foundation, which 
is trying to recruit organ do- 
ners . .” 

The Organ Donor Program of 
the National Kidney Foundation 
(315 Park Avenue South, New 



York, N.Y. 10010, if you want to 
look into it) is a little more than a 
year old, is not restricted to kid- 
ney transplants, and has spread up 
and down and across the land. For- 
ty-nine of the fifty states, plus the 
District of Columbia, have passed 
the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, 
with Massachusetts, at this writ- 
ing, the sole holdout. 

The Act transforms into a legal 
document a wallet-size card, which 
you may either carry next to your 
driver’s license for as long as you 
live — or tear up and file in the near- 
est trash can, with pobody on 
Earth the wiser. Not et^en the two 
friends who witnessed your signa- 
ture on the card. In your wallet the 
card remains — for as long as you 
want — the sole record anywhere 
that you are playing the game as 
a Giver. 

Advances in medical science 
now make it possible to replace a 
variety of malfunctioning human 
organs. Techniques for transplant- 
ing kidneys and corneas are most 
advanced, but progress is being 
made in overcoming transplanta- 
tion problems connected with the 
liver, pancreas, heart, bone and 
other tissue. The Uniform Donor 
Card permits you to specify, over 
your signature, how much or how 
little of yourself you care to Give 
to save a relative, friend or stran- 
ger. 

Well over 2.5 million Uniform 
Donor Cards are now presumed to 
be nestling in the wallets of poten- 
tial Givers. Since no records are 
kept, the exact number of cards 
active at any given moment is un- 
available, but effects of the pro-

so impressive was the quaiity of your participation 
in the reader poils (particularly the December one) 
that we would purely love to put our money where 
your mouth is — e.g., pick your brains in behalf of your 
fellow readers. 

Here's the idea: we'll pay $10 for a lead letter and 
$5 each for other letters to be published in Galaxy 
under the heading: 



DIRECTIONS 



Use this new department to push your pet peeve or 
dream. Be controversial if you like but be also con- 
structive. Topics: you pick 'em but keep them in the 
science/science-fiction areas. Criticism, camment, 
speculation are fine, but make them well feunded. 
Bias is okay when so identified. Abuse, bigotry — no. 

Except for unusual instances net clearly foresee- 
able, correspondence simply commenting on 
Galaxy will be handled as before — without pay- 
ment. It will be reported on at approximately six- 
month intervals. Your reward for such letters will be 
a magazine more tailored to your needs; ours will be 
knowing you.

With every man doing his 
best for those he loves, 
who needs outside enemies? 




I 

ON THE MOUNTAIN 

A THICK pad of pine needles lay 
trampled into dust almost ev- 
erywhere, but it was nonetheless a 
very decent campsite. Lying on the 
top of a ridge, it was separated 
from other sites by underbrush be- 
tween the pines and spruce. There 
was a space under a tree for a tent. 
At night, when the winds blew, the 
susurrance in the needles high 
above made a restful background 
for sleep. 

To the east trees marched down- 
hill, so that the eye could reach 
above them across a distant wood- 
ed ridge to a great rocky peak. In 
the late afternoon sun the granite 
slope glowed a brilliant yellow 
against dark blue sky; the slopes 
below, nearer the campsite, were in 
shadow now and formed a dark 
green base for the composition. 

Peter Lathrop stood by the 
campfire looking at the scene, then 
glanced at his watch. He drew a 
deep breath, held it, let it out, fin- 
ished off the beer in his hand and 
threw the can aside. 

“Grace, the air out here’s so 
good you can taste it,” he said. 

“Not in here,” a voice called 
back from the tent. “I’m chang- 
ing the baby.” 

“Where are the kids?” 

“How should I know? Down the 
hill by the big rock. Pete, you’d 
better get them.” 

“Yeah.” Pete looked at his 
watch again, then headed toward a 
path leading downhill. 

The path switched back twice 
and passed below a huge boulder 

6 



imbedded in the side of the hill. 
On top of the boulder were four 
children. A teenager stood on the 
highest point, eyeing the glowing 
mountain. A smaller boy of per- 
haps nine and two girls, one ten or 
eleven, the other about five, small 
for her age, were variously occu- 
pied. 

They saw Pete. 

“Hi, Dad,” the teenager said, 
“Come on up.” 

“No, you come down, Tim. 
And help the Peewee.” 

The Peewee said, “I don’t want 
to go.” : 

“Judy, you and Mike, too.” 

“Dad, can’t we stay until dark? 
It’s a long time yet.” 

“We’re late already. We have to 
drive a thousand miles by day af- 
ter tomorrow. Come on. Every- 
body off.” 

Mike said, “Come on up just 
for a second.” 

Pete started to get angry. 
“Mike, you get down right now. I 
don’t want to go any more than 
you do. Now get down here, all of 
you.” 

With great reluctance the chil- 
dren made their way down, Tim 
going first and lifting the little ones 
to the ground. In single file, Pete 
bringing up the rear, they returned 
to the campsite. Grace emerged 
from the tent as they came into the 
clearing. She carried a baby and 
led a toddler of two by the hand. 

“We have to go?” she asked. 

“It’s five o’clock.” 

An odd silence fell over the 
family, broken at length by the 
man. “Tim, you and Mike take 
the tent down. You girls carry the 
other stuff to the car.” 



GALAXY 




While the older boys jumped on 
the folded tent, pressing air out of 
the canvas, the two little girls 
came up to the car with armloads 
of pine cones. 

The older one asked, “Daddy, 
can we bring these?” 

The man backed out of the 
Volkswagen. 

“Now where would I put all 
those? Throw ’em back in the 
woods.” 

“Honey, can’t they take a cou- 
ple?” Grace’s voice came from in- 
side the car. 

“You’re not supposed to take 
anything. Oh, well — you each take 
two and throw the rest back.” The 
girls ran happily a few feet toward 
the trees, dumped their loads on 
the ground and began discussing 
which were the best. The two boys 
brought the tent and heaved it atop 
the Volkswagen; it fit behind the 
suitcases and Just in front of a 
large propane tank on a frame 
welded to the cartop; from the 
tank two copper lines ran down in- 
to the engine compartment. 

Tim asked, “Can we take some, 
too?” 

He and Mikejoined the girls. 

“Take one for Mother,” Grace 
called. 

“Look around, you kids, and 
see if we left anything,” Pete said. 
“We’re ready.” 

He gave a last tug at the strap 
holding the tent and suitcases 
down. 

G race came out of the car and 
the children came up, holding 
their pine cones. They all looked 
at the mountain, now beginning to 
turn orange. 



Tim asked, “Dad, do we have to 
go? Couldn’t we stay one more 
day?” 

“I don’t want to go,” the Pee- 
wee said and started to cry in a 
small, frightened voice. Pete sim- 
ply stared at the mountain. 

“Daddy, I hate it down there,” 
Judy said. “I want to stay here.” 
She started to cry, too, and that 
made the Peewee cry harder. 

“Grace, get those kids in the 
car,” the man said in a low voice, 
still looking at the mountain. 

“Okay, honey. Sweetheart, you 
first, in the back. You, too, Pee- 
wee, and then Mike, next to the 
baby. Make room for Tim.” She 
was hiding tears, too. “No, don't 
put your feet on those — we’ll need 
them.” 

She took the toddler on her lap 
on the passenger side in front. The 
man turned from the mountain 
and got in. 

“Might as well have the windows 
down,” he said, starting the engine. 
A puff of burned oil came out the 
exhausts, momentarily obscuring 
the beer cans and paper plates be- 
hind the car. 

“It was a good vacation, hon- 
ey,” Grace said. 

From behind her came muffled 
sobs. 

The car rolled off the grass and 
onto the dirt road leading down- 
ward among the trees. In a few 
hundred yards the road led past 
the picnic grounds, where people 
waved; nobody in the car waved 
back. On through the trees the car 
rolled, with a whine of second gear 
and the crunch of tires on gravel. 
Gradually the trees began to thin; 
they grew shorter and the under-

brush was brown around the edges 
near the road. Finally the road 
reached a sharp switchback with a 
wide shoulder and the man pulled 
the car to the side and parked. 

“All right, get ’em out. Throw 
the bags in the back.” No one 
moved and the man became angry. 
“Come on, can’t you smell it? Put 
’em on and roll up the windows.” 
Grace said, “Okay, babies, we 
have to. Tim, give me the little 
one and mine and Dad’s.” 

Tim pulled three khaki bags 
from under his feet and passed 
them up front; he took out others 
and passed them around and all 
pulled at the straps. 

“It looks like a pig’s snout,” 
Judy said, in tears. She pressed the 
blunt, cone over her face, pushed 
her hair back to let the upper part 
with goggles fit against her fore- 
head, pulled the elastic straps 
down behind her head. “1 hate it.” 
“Stop crying — you’ll fog up the 
eyes.” the man said, his voice 
muffled by his own respirator. He 
looked in the rearview mirror and 
saw Tim leaning against the side 
of the car, his masked face turned 
to the upholstry. “Tim, do the ba- 
by first. 1 always have to tell you.” 
Tim said, not moving, “I’m not 
going to do the baby.” 

“God damn it — ” the man start- 
ed, but Grace put her hand on his 
arm firmly. 

“I’ll do it,” she said. She opened 
her door, got out, stood the tod- 
dler on the ground, pulled the seat 
forward and leaned into the back. 
The baby began to scream. Finally 
the screams became muffled and 
Grace said, “Tim, no, Mike, you 
hold her hands, just till she gets 



used to it again.” She backed out, 
picked up the grotesque little 
masked form waiting beside the 
car and got back in. The door 
slammed, the windows rolled up 
and the car moved on. 

Around the bend the trees were 
almost all brown and the road was 
very dusty. Down the family 
coasted, past the ranger station. 
Finally they reached the last long 
gentle grade. The road ahead was 
hazy. It stretched down into thick- 
er and thicker haze until it disap- 
peared into a murky gray-yellow 
layer that reached ;to the visible 
horizon. The man gripped the 
wheel with both hands and stared 
straight ahead. The baby began to 
scream again and Peewee and Judy 
began to cry, too, as the car de- 
scended into the opaque cloud. 



THE WATCHERS 

T he survey plane broke into the 
clear at 3500 feet. A level plain, 
yellow-gray, with a fuzzy overlay 
and no distinct features, stretched 
to the horizon. 

The pilot reached to his neck 
and keyed the microphone. “Sur- 
vey, this is Survey Four. Four 
thousand feet, VFR on top.” 
“Survey Four, Roger. Arrive at 
intersection Yellow in two min- 
utes.” 

“Survey Four, out.” 

The observer in the back of the 
converted 170 tapped the pilot. 
“Can we take off the respirators?” 
“Go ahead.” Both unsnapped 
the mouthpieces and let them dan- 
gle, the pilot adjusting his throat 
microphone.

“I don’t see any breaks at all,” 
the voice from the rear said. 

“Set up. We make the run any- 
way. Intersection in one minute. 
Over Baltimore now, heading due 
west.” 

“Okay.” The observer tweaked 
a knob or two on his portable con- 
trol panel and watched the screen 
before him. His face was illumi- 
nated yellow by the displays. “Any 
time.” 

“Coming up — start.” 

The plane headed away from the 
sunrise in a straight and level line. 
A brilliant orange contrail grew a 
thin tendril toward Boston. The 
tendril hung stationary, then be- 
gan to spread laterally as the com- 
bustion products formed nuclei for 
condensation. After a while the 
sky was empty, except for the 
contrail, which was now a ragged 
orange cloud nearly a half-mile 
wide to the south. 

The survey pictures were being 
taken in several wavelengths, in- 
cluding infrared. A relay station 
in Baltimore picked up the signals 
and sent them by UHF repeater 
stations to Chicago, where the in- 
formation was reconstructed into 
pictures on six screens at Survey 
Control, on a top floor of the Pru- 
dential Building. On this day pe- 
destrians could not see the thirti- 
eth floor of the building and the 
observers in Survey Control, on 
the fortieth floor, could see nei- 
ther the street nor the top of the 
Sears building or the John Han- 
cock building, sixty floors higher. 

Two men were looking at the 
main monitor, which duplicated 
one of the six pictures flanking it. 
One man, standing and leaning 



over the other who was seated be- 
fore the console, spoke. 

“Well, Joe, any sense in record- 
ing this?” The screen showed only 
yellow-gray cloud floating down- 
ward endlessly. 

“I don’t know. We haven’t had 
a break in the last ten days. I sup- 
pose we’d better, at least the in- 
frared.” 

“Let’s have the range blips on; 
I’ll do it.” 

“Okay, Mac. It’s all set up.” 

Macauley went to another chair 
and picked up a microphone. 
“Survey Four, this is Survey, 
over.” 

“Survey Four.” 

“Give us the range markers in 
infrared. Hold four thousand, and 
check calibration.” 

“Roger.” 

On the main screen and the cor- 
responding small screen, two spots 
of ruby light appeared, wavered 
and converged into one. Numbers 
began to blink once per second at 
the bottom of the main monitor 
screen; 3528—3535—3570—3550 
— 3510, showing small variations 
in altitude of the cloud top. 

“What was it yesterday?” Joe 
asked. 

“Around thirty-four hundred — 
it’s a hundred feet thicker today. 
God.” 

Joe reached for the microphone 
and his voice broke into the for- 
mal singsong of the military radio- 
man. “Survey Four, this is Sur- 
vey, over?” 

“Survey Four.” 

“/?echeck laser calibration and 
altitude at Fo-wer, zero, zero, ze- 
ro?” 

“Roger.” The red spot became

two, then one again. “Survey, the 
calibration is down the middle and 
radar altitude converts to pressure 
altitude, four thousand point ze- 
ro, zero. Stand by for barometer 
check.” 

In a moment the voice returned. 
“I verify calibration. Survey, 
over.” 

“Uh, Roger, Survey Four, this 
is Survey, out.” 

“I’d better talk this over with 
Taylor,” Macauley said. “Record 
the infrared and the markers, Joe.” 

Joe flipped some switches, while 
Macauley left. Joe turned on an 
intercom and spoke into it. 
Through the control room window 
could be seen a large room, actu- 
ally a converted TV stage in earli- 
er days, where several dozen men 
in shirtsleeves sat before consoles. 
A voice crackled back from a 
small loudspeaker overhead. 

“Right, Joe. We’re talking to 
Denver and Salt Lake right now; 
we’ll get on Survey Seven as soon 
as the Salt Lake frequency clears.” 

M acauley shut the door be- 
hind him and proceeded down 
a corridor to another door, 
marked: Midwest and Eastern 
Survey Control Headquarters. He 
nodded to the receptionist behind 
the low rail separating the wait- 
ing room, from the rest of the of- 
fice, made his way between desks 
where girls sat typing and knocked 
at the door lettered: Survey Con- 
trol Coordinator, James X. Tay- 
lor. 

A voice sounded within and he 
entered. 

Jim Taylor was dictating to a 
stenographer. He looked up, said, 

10 



“Hi, Mac, be with you in a min- 
ute — ” and went on: “Let’s see — 
‘Ours is, of course, strictly a mon- 
itoring function, but our readings 
during the past ten days warrant 
an urgent warning.’ No, strike 
‘warrant’ and substitute: ‘call for 
— The above concentrations of 
sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, 
carbon monoxide and particulates 
show a steady rise beginning on 
Tuesday, August seventh, nine- 
teen-seventy-nine, and continuing 
to the present. The increase is 
steady. There has been great dif- 
ficulty in pressing ernergency mea- 
sures any further. Mayor Finlay 
insists that high-grade coal re- 
serves must be held for winter, 
since a heating emergency is al- 
ready foreseeable. He insists al- 
so that any further reduction in 
line voltage, according to his en- 
gineers, would threaten the sur- 
vival of Chicago and its sub- 
urbs.’ ” 

Macauley pinched his nose and 
jabbed a thumb back over his 
shoulder. Taylor nodded and con- 
tinued. 

“‘This is probably true. The 
filtration and refrigeration units 
all over the city are running under- 
speed, so that even forty stories 
up it is difficult to keep up with 
normal seepage.’ ” 

He motioned to the stenogra- 
pher and asked, “What is it, 
Mac?” 

“Same, but worse. The top is 
up about a hundred feet over yes- 
terday. No breaks on a line due 
west from Baltimore for two hun- 
dred miles so far.” 

“A hundred feet? Couldn’t that 
be the Alleghenies?” 



GALAXY 




“Average.” 

“1 see.” Taylor thought, then 
sighed. “Okay, here goes. Stick 
around, Mac, you’re going to have 
to back me up. Betty?” He re- 
sumed dictation pace: “‘I consider 
this a situation of the utmost grav- 
ity. Our reports for the past ten 
days have been sent through nor- 
mal channels, but in the absence of 
the Undersecretary there has been 
no official response to the attached 
special notices.’ New paragraph. 

“Tn addition, it is becoming ap- 
parent that local authorities are at- 
tempting to deal with the problem 
in their own areas as if there were 
no problems elsewhere. Cities are 
competing with each other for a 
larger share of the power in the dis- 
tribution grids; they have reached 
the point where they are operating 
with negative reserves and require 
power from the grid even to main- 
tain the status quo. The latest ex- 
pansion of power generation equip- 
ment in the city of Chicago has 
been accomplished by adding coal- 
burning equipment instead of nu- 
clear power; natural gas and oil 
supplies are all but exhausted and 
there is sharp competition between 
transportation needs and home 
heating requirements for fuel — and 
of course, it is the same consumers 
who compete against themselves. 
All these factors have radically in- 
creased the output of pollutants in 
this area and very similar situa- 
tions hold in all major cities with- 
in this Survey zone.’ Paragraph. 

“‘As I mentioned earlier in 
more detail, we appear to have 
reached a point where the produc- 
tion of contaminants itself is call- 
ing forth measures which add more 



contamination than they protect 
against. The whole system is slow- 
ing down because of the near-im- 
possibility of conducting normal 
business while at the same time 
maintaining life in an atmosphere 
that long ago passed the danger 
levels of concentration for most 
contaminants.” Paragraph. 

“‘Now we see a new phenom- 
enon entering the picture — the 
filling in of all breaks in the cloud 
cover over the entire Northeast 
quadrant of the country. Very 
soon this will endanger crops and 
already the change in upper-air 
conditions has caused — ’ strike 
that, Betty, substitute: ‘appears to 
have caused a dropoff in rainfall 
and an alteration in the whole 
weather pattern. The cloud cover 
apparently began to thicken as the 
last breaks disappeared; the last 
report, which is current to the 
present hour, indicates that the 
thickening is proceeding without 
any indication of slowing down.’ 
1 said that already, Betty, but 
leave it in. Paragraph. 

“We in Survey Control are 
unanimous — ’” Macauley nodded 
to Taylor’s questioning look — 
“‘in the opinion that mere emer- 
gency measures have already failed 
and we see no possible chance of 
averting a major disaster. We have 
now only a choice between disas- 
ters — one we control and one that 
runs on out of control while inef- 
fectual attempts are made to pro- 
vide nearly normal conditions in a 
few isolated spots.’ Paragraph. 

“‘My recommendations, which 
are based on what I believe to be a 
clear and self-evident set of facts, 
are as follows: ’ Mac?”

“No, Jim, don’t forget the bat-

“Strike it, Betty. Is that enough,

“Might be. 1 can’t account for

1 gave you.” 

The stenographer sat for a mo- 
ment scribbling, snapped her book 
shut. She sat a moment longer, 
then rose, giving Taylor a look 
full of tears as she left. 

“Smart girl,” Taylor said. “If 
I had time I’d be crying, too.” 

“Will anyone listen? Whom are 
you sending it to?” 

“Secretary of the Interior. 
White House. Copies all over the 
place. They’ll be carried back by 
Survey One tonight.” 

“Then we’ll getia response to- 
morrow or Friday.” 

“Or we’ll go to Washington!” 
“What about the Undersecre- 
tary? You’re bypassing him.” 

“He’s studying future pollu- 
tion problems in Alaska with his 
wife and children and a guide who 
knows where some bears are.” 

“Is the meeting still on?” 
“Three-thirty, all section chiefs. 
Bring Joe, he’ll be up to date on 
Survey Four and tell him to get 
summaries on the other runs.” 
Taylor sighed and swiveled his 
chair around to look out his win- 
dow. Dim building shapes could be 
discerned in the haze. “I wish it 
were May instead of August. 
They’ll be lighting up their fur- 
naces in a month or so.”

NIGHT FLIGHT TO D.C. 

M ACAULEY stood in the cabin 
of the business jet, talking to 
the pilot who had been in Survey 
Four. He put a briefcase in the co- 
pilot’s seat, which was empty.

“I’d feel a lot happier if you 
weren’t going alone.” 

“No sweat,” the pilot said. 
“This ship is designed for one pi- 
lot and one observer and there’ll 
be no survey tonight.” 

“The East Coast is absolutely 
solid.” 

“I said Td do it. 1 read what’s 
in those letters and I know what it 
looks like on top. I’m with you — 
why won’t you take my word for 
it?” 

“At least fuel up with safety 
fuel.” 

The pilot grinned. “That’s what 
they’re putting in. I changed the 
order after the last report from 
Dulles.” 

“Well, that makes me feel a lit- 
tle better — at least the plane won’t 
burn if you rack it up.” 

“Cheery thought. 1 don’t like 
that stuff — you have to keep the 
combustion temperature too high 
in order to make it burn and it 
leaves orange crap all over the sky. 
It doesn’t seem right, especially 
when it’s Survey One doing it.” 
“Forget it; if they follow our 
recommendations you’ll be taking 
a stagecoach back.” 

A ground crewman came in the 
door with a clip-board. “Sign 
here.” 

The pilot signed and the crew- 
man left. Macauley shook hands 
with the pilot and left also. Out- 
side he turned and closed the door, 
then walked rapidly toward the 
terminal building while the crew- 
man cleared away the steps and 
stowed the hoses back into the 
tanker truck. The day-glow orange 
truck pulled away as Macauley 
entered through the broad glass

we'll be doing Larry's next collection, 
ALL THE MYRIAD WAYS. And in 
August, the reissue of RINGWORLD 
along with Niven's earlier works. 1971 
is the Year of Larry Niven— and 
proud are we to have a share in it.

INCIDENTALLY, for car nuts, whose 
numbers certainly include many a 
science-fiction fan, we are now doing 
an illustrated series, priced at only a 
buck. You ought to be able to find 
books on the Bugatti, the Alfa 
Romeo; also on Le Mans. 



JUNE, now. A month for Robert Sil- 
verberg. A book which is not science 
fiction— but then, what is? So we'll 
talk about it anyway. It is certainly 
not like anything the Pope has ever 
written before. A sort of Fellini trip, 
if you will, in literary form. So emo- 
tional, these Italians. SON OF MAN— 
don't miss. And another Silverberg, 
this one more in the tradition, titled 
MOONFERNS AND STARSONGS, 
an elegiac title for sardonicus. And 
finally, an Oriental escapade titled 
VATHEK, by an utterly mad English- 
man, William Beckford. Until July.

doors of the terminal building. 

He arrived at the upper level in 
time to see the plane release its 
brakes and roll toward the taxi- 
way, its high-intensity flasher oper- 
ating and a rotating red beacon 
sweeping light across the fuselage 
and surrounding buildings. It ap- 
peared to be the only active plane 
and for good reason; the night was 
black out there and the red bea- 
con rapidly became a reddish blob 
as the plane moved off into the 
murk. The jet glow was shot with 
orange streaks. 

Macauley waited' until the flash- 
ing red blob reappeared from be- 
hind a hangar, climbing, and he 
heard the faint jet sound through 
the window; then he turned and 
went out through the nearly empty 
terminal. 

At 3800 feet the pilot saw the 
stars. On the eastern horizon the 
moon, in its last quarter, was ris- 
ing; the pale light shone on the 
cloud cover, providing an easy ref- 
erence for visual flight. 

“O’Hare, this is Survey One 
leaving the control zone; request 
permission to change frequency.” 

“Roger, One — have a good 
trip.” 

The pilot removed his respira- 
tor. He took the plane to eighteen 
thousand; from there it looked as 
if he were flying over an endless 
ocean of milk. A few times he 
changed omni frequencies and 
twice he had conversations with 
control areas on the ground. The 
air was nearly still; he indicated 
500 knots airspeed and computed 
only 520 knots ground speed with 
a direct tail wind. The jet stream 
had moved far north; it had not 



14 



GALAXY 




flowed over the United States at 
all for six months. 

He saw Cleveland as a dull red 
glow under the clouds, with Akron 
Wely visible in the distance; Pitts- 
burgh was not visible at all and 
Baltimore, when he passed over it, 
was only a suggestion of a glowing 
patch. By that time he was letting 
down. 

“Dulles, this is Survey One.” 
“Survey One, Dulles.” 

“Request landing instructions, 
what else?” 

“Negative, Survey One. We are 
now below minimums. Can you 
hold?” 

“Estimate thirty minutes re- 
serve, Dulles. Is anything going to 
change in thirty minutes?” 

“Stand by. One.” In a moment 
the operator was back. “Divert to 
Baltimore, One. We just had a 
power failure here and are on 
emergency power. The high-inten- 
sity approach is out.” 

“Roger, Dulles, out.” He 
changed frequencies. “Baltimore, 
this is Survey One.” 

“Survey One, go ahead.” 

“1 have been diverted from 
Dulles — can you take me? I’m 
about twenty miles north, letting 
down through eight thousand.” 
“We have a power failure here. 
One, and have no ILS. Accident 
on the runway. Can you hold?” 
“Not long enough to matter; 
twenty-five minutes. Is your GCA 
operative?” 

“Affirmative, the radar is op- 
erative.” 

“1 have radar, too — you’ll have 
to talk me in.” The pilot turned 
on his radar and in a moment a 
wand of light was sweeping back 



and forth on the display. He ad- 
justed the intensity until only the 
permanent targets showed. 

“Stay on this frequency. One,” 
a second voice said. “Turn on 
your transponder, please.” The pi- 
lot did. “All right, we verify you 
eighteen miles northeast. Make a 
one-minute turn, one-eighty de- 
grees.” 

“Roger.” The horizon tipped 
gently and stayed that way as the 
plane circled. Then it steadied and 
flew for several minutes, letting 
down. “Baltimore, 1 indicate four 
thousand five hundred, does that 
agree with your reading?” 

“Negative, your transponder 
shows you at three thousand nine 
hundred. We have no height-find- 
ing radar operative. Stand by.” 
There was a pause, with the carri- 
er still on. “One, we are going to 
take your altimeter reading, please 
advise every five hundred feet. 
You are left on the track, please 
turn ten right.” 

“Ten right.” 

“That’s good, hold it. Get ready 
for ten left when I say.” 

“Roger.” 

“Get ready for ten left. Now. 
That’s good. Have you the field 
on radar?” 

“Affirmative, I think I see the 
wreck and the two runways. 1 ap- 
pear to be lined up with the left 
one, is that correct?” 

“Affirmative.” 

“Three thousand five hundred.” 
He was in the soup. 

“Roger, you are high, please in- 
crease sink rate.” 

“Roger.” There was silence, 
then; “Three thousand.” Pause. 
“Two thousand five hundred.” 



A CONGREGATION OF VAPORS

Again a pause. “Two thousand.” 
“Drifting right, One, correct 
left five.” 

“Roger.” 

“Right down the pike.” 

“One thousand five hundred.” 
“Stretch it out a little. One.” 
“Roger.” The pilot added pow- 
er briefly, then cut back again. 
“One thousand.” 

“Correct left. One, you’re drift- 
ing left.” 

“Which?” 

“Correction, correction — steer 
right ten. Right ten. Hold it. Now 
left ten. Have you the runway 
yet?” 

“Negative. Ground clutter on 
radar, no visual. Five hundred.” 
The pilot flipped off the radar. 
“All right. One, no further ac- 
knowledgments, please. Left five. 
Good. Hold left five — now correct 
two right. A little more. Good. 
You’re over the inner marker now, 
maintain two hundred feet per 
minute. Drifting left again, cor- 
rect right. More. All right, fast, 
ten right and ten left, now. Have 
you the runway yet?” 

“Neg — •” and that was all. 

In the tower, the controller 
dropped his earphones around his 
neck and fell back in his seat. He 
raised his eyes to look through the 
window. An orange glow showed 
where the Allegheny Airlines flight 
had come to rest after wiping out 
the Instrument Landing System 
antennas. The rest of the field was 
black; the blue taxiway marker 
lights were invisible past the first 
row. He saw a faint glow moving 
away from the Allegheny wreck’s 
location, probably an ambulance. 
“Jack, take it, will you?” the 



controller called and stood up. He 
left the tower and made his way 
down to the apron. In a while an 
ambulance drove up. 

“Is this the Survey jet that just 
came in?” he asked the driver. 

“Yeah. It didn’t burn, must 
have been using safety fuel.” 

“How many aboard?” 

“One.” 

The controller moved to the 
back, where attendants were pull- 
ing out the stretcher; its wheels 
popped into place. A briefcase lay 
on top of the figure under the 
blanket. 

“Is he bad?” the controller 
asked. 

“That’s a familiar voice,” came 
from the stretcher. “Not dead, 
thanks.” 

“You were way left at the end.” 

“I’m alive. Wait a minute, you 
guys, 1 want to talk to him. Listen, 
you have to do something for me. 
Government business and impor- 
tant. Open this and read the in- 
structions inside; then deliver the 
letters now, tonight, in D.C. There 
are some loose copies — read one. 
It has to be tonight, as soon as 
possible. Okay?” 

“Okay.” 

“Good. Then let’s get out of 
here. My legs hurt.” 

He couldn’t have picked a bet- 
ter man. The controller had just 
talked two airplanes right into the 
ground because of faulty equip- 
ment and the worst sock-in ever 
to hit the East Coast. 

COPING 

G race and Pete dropped suit- 
cases, towels and coats by the

GALAXY 




door and herded the children in. 
Tim was carrying the baby. 

Grace said, “Seal the door, 
Tim, I can’t wait to get this thing 
off my face.” She went into the 
TV room, flipping on the lights, 
and turned on the Filteraire that 
took up an entire window. Red 
lights came on in every room, 
blinking. “Kids, you can go to the 
bathroom, but leave the resps on 
until the green comes on.” 

Pete came out of the kitchen 
holding a can of beer, unopened. 

“Come on, green,” he said. 
“I’m thirsty.” 

“I’m thirsty,” Peewee said and 
took off her respirator. 

“Peewee!” Pete shouted and 
started toward her. 

Peewee choked and tried to 
scream, but she coughed instead 
and grabbed for her mask. Pete 
took her mask in one hand and 
pressed it against her face while he 
picked her up around the middle 
with his other arm and ran with 
her into the TV room. Fie held her 
face in the strong draft of the Fil- 
teraire while she coughed and cried 
and struggled for breath. 

Grace came running in. “What 
did she do? Pete? What happened?” 

Pete was saying, “Take it easy, 
Peewee, don’t breathe so hard — 
come on, honey, take it easy — 
Gracie, she’s all right. It was only 
for a couple of seconds — her resp 
came off.” 

Finally Peewee sat up by her- 
self, her head against the air out- 
let, and allowed the respirator 
straps to be readjusted. She was 
still coughing, taking long breaths 
and holding the mask tight with 
one hand. 



“Pete, you spilled beer on — oh, 
it isn’t open.” Grace had made a 
trip to the front room. “Honey, 
here’s your beer. The green is on.” 

Pete waved it away. 

Cries came from the bedroom: 
“Green, everybody, green, the 
green is on!” 

Tim came in, pulling his mask 
off. “They’re in bed. I took the 
baby’s off — she’s wet.” 

Grace and Pete looked at each 
other, dangling their masks. She 
leaned forward and Pete kissed 
her. 

“I like you better like this,” he 
said. “Okay, Peewee.” 

He leaned down and pulled at 
the back elastic on Peewee’s mask. 
Grace went off to see to the baby. 

“No!” Peewee screamed and 
pushed him away, holding her 
mask on and crowding closer to 
the Filteraire. Pete dropped to his 
knees beside her. 

“Honey, the air’s all right now, 
see? Mine is off and Mommy’s and 
Tim’s. Look.” But Peewee’s eyes 
were shut tight behind the glass 
goggles and she said “No — no — 
no.” 

“Leave her alone for a while,” 
Grace said, passing by the TV 
room door. “I’ll get us something 
to eat.” 

She went into the kitchen. 

“Dad — your beer,” Tim said, 
holding it toward him. Pete stood 
up and took it, opened it. 

“Not very cold. Hey, Pee- 
wee — ” but the child huddled 
where she was. 

Finally he turned and, noticing 
the television, switched it on. 

“Should I turn off some lights?” 
Tim asked. 



A CONGREGATION OF VAPORS 



17 




“Oh — sure, I forgot.” 

Tim went into the other room, 
came back and turned off all but 
one light in the TV room. 

“You know, I think the voltage 
is down some more,” Tim said, 
settling into his chair. “Look at 
that light — it’s real yellow.” 

The picture struggled to life, 
rolling and dim. Tim rose and 
turned the vertical hold control, 
halting the rolling. “The control’s 
all the way to one end,” he said. 
A black band showed top and bot- 
tom. “What a lousy picture. 
Who’s he?” 

“Some kind of announcement, 
1 don’t know. Turn up the sound.” 
“It is up,” Tim reported. “Oh, 
the tuning’s way off.” 

He got sound. 

S OMEBODY in a respirator was 
answering an unheard question. 
“No, we expect the north-side 
plant to be normal by morning.” 
The camera switched to the ques- 
tioner, a TV reporter whose mask 
was labeled NBC. 

“Just what caused the break- 
down, Mr. Spivak?” 

Spivak sounded harassed, as if 
he had been answering the same 
question for different reporters all 
day. His rfiask, of course, showed 
no expression. 

“As I just told Mr. Phillips, we 
aren’t exactly sure. It seems that 
when the voltage was reduced last 
night — well, I should explain that 
a great many apartment buildings 
on the north side have installed 
voltage boosters to keep their ten- 
ants’ voltage from dropping when 
the power company reduces its 
output. Of course the whole pur- 



pose of reducing power is to less- 
en the load on the generators. The 
voltage boosters thwart that pur- 
pose — in fact, they have just the 
opposite effect. When the voltage 
drops there are additional losses 
in the boosters themselves and the 
losses in the power lines are in- 
creased by the higher currents they 
pull. The result is that when the 
voltage is reduced the power load 
goes up instead of down.” 

“I see. So if everyone had a vol- 
tage booster — or regulator — there 
would be no way ,to reduce the 
load on the lines?” 

“That is correct. The only way 
would be to drop the voltage so 
far that the regulators would stop 
working — and that, of course, is 
what happened last night. Unfor- 
tunately the drop was not carried 
out on purpose. The sewage treat- 
ment plant behind us here has very 
large pumps operated by electric 
power. Last night they were all 
operating, too — and they’re what 
broke the camel’s back. The volt- 
age dropped, the pump motors 
stalled and then burned out, throw- 
ing a very heavy load onto the line. 
That finished off the generators.” 
“Mr. Spivak, that power sta- 
tion supplies a good part of the 
public housing and ghetto area as 
well as the high-rise apartment dis- 
trict, doesn’t it? Did those people 
have regulators, too?” 

“No. 1 would say not. Regula- 
tors are costly and, of course, 
there would be none in a public 
housing project.” 

“Then would it be fair to say 
that the people in the high-rises 
who had regulators are directly 
responsible for the four hundred 



18 



GALAXY 




deaths we had here last night?” 
“I’m afraid I can’t comment on 
that. It is certainly true that the 
voltage regulators were a major 
contributing factor. There were 
many deaths in all areas.” 

“But many poor people don’t 
own respirators for every member 
of the family and have to stay in- 
side buildings equipped with filter 
systems. When the power was lost 
and the filters stopped — they had 
no chance, did they?” 

“I’m afraid I do not have the 
answer to that question. Ask city 
hall. Will you excuse me now? 1 
have to return to my duties.” 

“That was Mr. Arthur Spivak, 
chief engineer of the Sanitary Dis- 
trict. Now back to our studios.” 
The picture changed to show 
two men without respirators 
seated at a low table. 

“Thank you, Art Terrier,” one 
of them said. “This is Tom Friend- 
ly again, continuing our report on 
the North Side disaster. I have with 
me Mr. Anthony Capuzzo, Demo- 
cratic alderman from the forty- 
second ward which was so hard-hit 
last night. Mr. Capuzzo, has the 
mayor been in touch with you?” 
Capuzzo spoke in a rumbling 
bass. “His honor called me early 
this morning, yes. He extended his 
sincerest sympathy to the bereaved 
families of my ward. This has been 
a terrible experience for all of us.” 
“Mr. Capuzzo, what do you 
think was the main cause of the 
failure?” 

“Well, Tom, we’ll have to wait 
for the experts on that one; at the 
moment we’re concentrating on a 
massive cleanup operation around 
the sewage plant and on restoring 



power in the areas where there is 
still a blackout.” 

“You heard Mr. Spivak, Aider- 
man — do you agree that the volt- 
age regulators were a major cause 
of last night’s disaster?” 

“1 wouldn’t want to jump to 
conclusions,” Capuzzo said. “You 
must remember that the Sanitary 
District has been having difficulties 
with its equipment.” 

“Are you referring to the con- 
troversy between the mayor and 
Mr. Spivak over the purchase of 
equipment for sewage treatment 
and transport?” 

“Well, Tom, I know that the 
newspapers have tried to make this 
into a controversy, but Mr. Spiv- 
ak is a fine gentleman even if he 
is a Republican — ” a genial smile 
— “and the mayor is in full com- 
munication with him. The failure 
of the two pump motors may have 
been caused simply by an unpre- 
dictable human error, faulty rhain- 
tenance or any of a number of un- 
derstandable factors. It is certain- 
ly true that the instant those two 
motors burned out the generating 
station was put out of commis- 
sion. But I’m no expert. We’ll just 
have to wait for an inquiry to be 
organized.” 

“Alderman, I understand that 
there were two deaths in the high- 
rise apartment where you live, but 
over two hundred in the Cabrini 
Homes. How do you account for 
that?” 

“Tom, we’re looking into that, 
believe me. I’m afraid I must 
leave.” 

“Mr. Spivak indicated earlier 
that it was because the high-rises 
generally have emergency power

for six to twelve hours, while the 
public housing projects have no 
provision for keeping filter units 
in operation in an emergency." 

“I'm afraid Mr. Spivak is jump- 
ing to conclusions again. I'm sor- 
ry, Tom, but 1 must get back to 
my ward — you understand." 

Grace's voice came from the 
kitchen. “Pete, come look at this 
mess!" 

“Wait a minute," Pete called. 

“. for station identification," 
the announcer was saying. The 
picture suddenly started to roll. 

“See if you can fix it, Tim," 
Pete said and went into the kitch- 
en. 

“Pete, everything in the freez- 
er's mushy.” 

“There was a big power failure 
last night — they must have got our 
power back just before we got 
home. Look, the clock is wrong.” 

“But listen, doesn’t the fridge 
sound funny?" 

Pete cocked an ear. “Yeah. The 
voltage must be way low." He 
opened the freezer compartment 
and felt inside.” It sure isn't very 
cold — no wonder my beer was 
warm." 

Peewee came into the kitchen, 
still wearing her respirator. 
“Mommy, I’m hungry and thirsty.” 

“Take off the resp, honey. We’ll 
have dinner soon — if there’s any- 
thing that didn’t spoil. Take it off, 
honey. Aren’t you tired of it after 
three days?” 

Peewee took off her mask. Tim 
came in. 

“I turned it off,” he said. 
“There’s no more adjustment. I 
can’t stop it from rolling.” 



Grace said, “1 heard them talk- 
ing about voltage regulators. 
What do they do?” 

Tim said, “There’s an ad in the 
paper — 1 was just looking at it. 
They say it keeps the voltage from 
changing.” 

“Do they work?” she asked 
Pete. 

“I suppose so. They sell them.” 
“For the whole house?” 

Pete got an interested look on 
his face. “Why sure. I suppose 
so.” 

Grace and he looked at each 
other, pleased. ' 

“Sure,” Pete said, looking at 
the refrigerator. “Why not?”

“I don’t watch it any more,”

“Climb to forty-five hundred 
and reset range calibration.” 
“Roger.” 

In a few minutes Joe said, 
“Same. Maybe thirty-seven fifty.” 
Macauley left, went to Taylor’s 
office. It was even hotter in there. 
Taylor was apparently unoccu- 
pied. Macauley sat down. 

“Did the letters get delivered?” 
“I’m trying to find out,” Tay- 
lor said. “You hear about the 
blackout in D.C. last night?” 
Macauley looked startled. “I 
hadn’t made the connection. He 
wouldn’t have landed there. Where 
did he go — Baltimore?” 

“Yeah, but he didn’t make a 
very good landing. I understand 
that he’s alive, but how alive 1 
don’t know. We’ve had big trou- 
ble with the phone lines this morn- 
ing. I’ve been trying to get New 
York, Washington, or Baltimore 
for an hour. They don’t know any- 
thing in Boston.’’ 

“How about a phone patch on 
the Survey link?” Macauley asked. 
“We’ve done a lot of that lately.” 
The phone rang just then and 
Taylor picked it up. 

He listened for a minute, then 
nodded to Macauley and said, 
“All right, thank you. Operator; I 
believe I’ll cancel the call now and 
try another way.” He hung up. 
“Let’s go.” 

They went back to the control 
room and Macauley raised the 
standby radioman in Baltimore. 

“Can you get a phone patch 
through to D.C.?” 



“Where to? Our own line is 
working.” 

“Good — get the Department of 
the Interior and work the push-to- 
talk at your end for us.” 

“Roger, stand by.” They could 
hear a dial tone, then dialing. A 
switchboard operator answered. 
“Department of the Interior.” 
Macauley handed the mike to 
Taylor, saying, “Push to Talk.” 
“This is James Taylor, director 
of Chicago Survey Control. I must 
speak to the Secretary.” 

“One moment, sir.” 

A pause. 

“This is the Secretary’s office, 
Mr. Taylor. Mr. Homer will 
speak to you directly.” 

“Hello, Taylor?” 

“Good morning, Mr. Secre- 
tary. Has my courier arrived?” 

“Is this line secure, Taylor?” 
Taylor looked at Macauley, 
who shook his head. 

“No, sir.” 

“No specifics, then. Your docu- 
ments arrived and the man is here 
now. The Secretary of Defense is 
also here. A helicopter will pick 
you up at Glenview Navel Air Sta- 
tion at noon your time; I want you 
on it and anyone else who is privy 
to the contents of the document. 
How many are there?” 

“I’ll check, sir. Three, 1 believe, 
including my personal secretary 
and my chief assistant.” 

“All right. I’ll see you this eve- 
ning.” 

“Sir — is any action being con- 
templated?” 

“We’ll discuss that this evening. 
Goodbye.” 

“Chicago, the Department has 
disconnected.”

Macauley took the mike. 
“Okay, Baltimore, thanks. Out.” 

T aylor said to Macauley, 
“Let’s go back to my office. 
Joe, you haven’t heard anything." 

Joe nodded, his eyes on the 
screen. 

They picked up Betty on the 
way and closed Taylor’s office 
door behind them. Taylor spoke. 

“I hadn’t figured on that so 
soon. Betty, who else saw those 
letters?” 

“Nobody. I sealed them myself 
and you locked the briefcase.” 

“All right. I didn’t want the se- 
curity angle to come in so soon, 
but Homer evidently has a differ- 
ent idea. The Secretary of Defense 
is in on it now and that probably 
means the Pentagon. If they’re 
still worried about revealing our 
condition to a foreign power, that 
means only one thing to me — they 
didn’t understand what’s in the let- 
ter. I didn’t tell the Secretary 
about the other letters — every Sen- 
ator should have one, as well as 
the White House and the other 
Cabinet members. Unless the pi- 
lot went to Interior first. He 
couldn’t have been hurt too badly 
in the crash — he was there when 
we called.” 

“Do you hope the letters were 
delivered — or weren’t?” Macau- 
ley asked wryly. 

“Were. If this gets covered up 
by security it’ll be too late to do 
anything. We’d better get going. 
There isn’t much time.” 

“Going where?” Betty said. 

“Oh. We’re under security rules 
now, by the way, whether we like 
it or not. We’ve been called to 



Washington, Betty — you, too, be- 
cause you’ve seen the letter. We 
have to be at Glenview by noon, 
which gives us just over two hours. 
You go home and pack. We’ll 
pick you up in front of your apart- 
ment at — better make it ten-thir- 
ty. We can’t count on traffic.” 
Macauley said, “Why not take 
the rapid transit?” 

“You weren’t watching the 
news,” Taylor said. “The north- 
west side blacked out again this 
morning and took the rapid transit 
down with it. Let’s;get going.” 

The trip was slow. Betty was on 
the street, waiting, when they 
picked her up twenty minutes late. 
Eden’s expressway was solid, all 
lanes in both directions, everyone 
with headlights on and behind 
closed windows. 

“Look at that,” Macauley said. 
“They still drive into town after 
all these years, even though they 
have to wear respirators to do it.” 
“Look at us,” Taylor, driving, 
said wryly. “We have a sealed car 
with air conditioning and filters, 
so our engine is carrying half 
again the normal load, putting out 
more gunk than anyone.” 

Betty said, “But we’re on im- 
portant business.” 

“So are they,” Taylor said. 
“That’s the trouble. Everyone has 
business; everyone needs air to 
breathe; everyone has to keep food 
from spoiling; everyone needs to 
watch TV — it goes on and on. Ev- 
erybody simply copes with the sit- 
uation as best he can. When the 
air gets thicker you go out and 
buy a more powerful filter unit, 
which draws more power and calls 
for more power generation, which 



22 



GALAXY 




makes the air even worse. The 
voltage regulator and your voltage 
goes back up — but the power fails 
altogether because of the extra 
load. The public transportation 
breaks down, so you drive to work 
and that makes the soup thicker 
outside. And so it goes. You don’t 
just suffer — you try to do some- 
thing. But if you work in a mill, 
a store, or drive a taxi, you don’t 
have the power to correct what’s 
causing the problem — you just 
cope with the symptoms one at a 
time, as they come up. The richer 
you get, the worse you make the 
situation.” 

Macauley added: “And every 
time you buy a new gadget you 
improve the situation inside your 
own little bubble — and between 
the bubbles it keeps getting dead- 
lier.” 

Betty asked, “Have you heard 
about the water pumps?” 

Macauley said, “No.” 

“Our apartment just got one. It 
keeps the water pressure up even 
when the city lowers it. 1 thought 
it was nice, but 1 suppose that’s 
just like the voltage regulators. 
Our bubble has one of those, too.” 

“Water pumps!’’ Macauley 
snorted. “So what happens when 
there’s a fire? Those pumps will 
suck the lines dry. And I’ll bet 
they’re all run by electric motors.” 

Taylor said, “I saw that thing 
last night on the voltage regula- 
tors. 1 wish they hadn’t mentioned 
them at all. The more people know 
about them, the more will buy 
them. They don’t care what it does 
to anyone else. 1 feel that we’re 
dangerously close to the situation 
where nobody can afford to be al- 



truistic any more — we’re living 
closer and closer to the edge of a 
breakdown. I wish 1 knew just how 
close we are.” 

“Oh, it’s just awfull" Betty said. 
“I guess you could call it that.” 
Taylor’s comment shut off the 
conversation. He concentrated on 
changing lanes. 

T hey reached the gate at Glen- 
view an hour late. Two plain- 
clothesmen were waiting for them 
there; they got into the car and all 
proceeded to the control-tower 
parking area. A helicopter was 
waiting, its blades revolving lazi- 
ly. It took off as soon as they were 
aboard and belted in. 

It was a huge long-range Air 
Force helicopter with jet engines 
for cruising; they stopped at 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base 
to refuel, had a late snack for 
lunch and touched down next at a 
pad next to the Pentagon. An un- 
derground passageway, sweltering 
but filtered, took them to a bank 
of elevators and their elevator let 
them out some stories higher at a 
carpeted lobby, air-conditioned 
and comfortable. 

“Another bubble,” Betty whis- 
pered to Macauley as the plain- 
clothesmen and Taylor talked to 
the receptionist. In a moment they 
were all ushered into a huge, car- 
peted office, containing soft leath- 
ered easy chairs in Air Force blue, 
arranged before an impressive 
desk. Behind the desk were the Air 
Force flag and the American flag 
on standards and the wall backing 
them was covered solidly with 
drapes of a deep rich blue. 

The three were left alone. They 

23 



A CONGREGATION OF VAPORS 




studied the rest of the room. 

One entire wall was taken up 
by a spectacular blowup of a 
squadron of supersonic fighter- 
bombers peeling off toward 
wooded hills below. Smoke was 
visible rising between the trees in a 
cratered area and small white 
puffs showed where new craters 
were being formed. A person sit- 
ting behind the desk could visual- 
ize himself hanging poised, ready 
for the long slide down through 
the air toward the jungle, as if he 
were a member of the squadron. 

Macauley said, looking at the 
picture, “All I can think of is how 
clear the air is.” 

“You can’t even tell what coun- 
try it is,” Betty said and swiveled 
her chair away from the picture. 

An aide — a major in incredibly 
perfect sartorial condition — came 
in briskly and sat on the edge of 
the desk, smiling. 

“Sorry to keep you waiting. 
Have a nice trip?” 

“Not bad,” Taylor said. 

“We were held up in traffic,” 
Macauley added. 

“General Soames will be with 
you shortly. He wants to brief you 
before you go over to the White 
House. All informal, of course. 
Would you like anything? Coffee? 
Drink?” 

There were no takers and the 
aide left them alone again. Ma- 
cauley discovered that his chair 
squeaked. 

Abruptly the door swung open 
again and another major came 
in, carrying a briefcase in one 
hand and what could only be one of 
the letters in the other — the let- 
terhead was visible as the aide set 



it in the center of the desk. The 
aide nodded amiably to the visi- 
tors, sat down in a chair behind 
and to the left of the desk. He 
snapped open the attache case, 
which converted into a writing 
table. He arranged pads and pens 
on it in his lap. 

Finally the main contingent ap- 
peared. Two more aides, colonels, 
held the doors open while a per- 
fectly pressed general, obvious- 
ly Soames, came through, fol- 
lowed by two lesser generals 
talking easily with each other. 
Soames was physically fit, white- 
haired, clean shaven and hand- 
some. 

The aides fanned out; one of the 
trailing generals sat on the cor- 
ner of the desk while Soames him- 
self pulled up a swivel chair to 
form a circle with the visitors. 
The other trailing general went 
over to the stenographer-aide, 
who said something that made 
them both laugh quietly. The two 
colonels found seats behind the 
trio. 

T he aide sitting at the desk 
stood. “General, may 1 intro- 
duce Miss Hatch, Mr. Macauley 
and the Director of Chicago 
Survey Control, Mr. James Tay- 
lor? General Soames.” He sat 
again. He had the names all cor- 
rect and had ordered the intro- 
duction so that the general shook 
hands last and most lengthily with 
Taylor and spoke to him first. 

“I appreciate your coming, Tay- 
lor,” he said. “I don’t want to hold 
you up, so let’s get to business. 
Please be seated.” They sat and the 
stenographer-aide in the back- 



24 



GALAXY 




ground quietly undipped a pen 
from his tunic pocket and began 
to write. 

“This is strictly informal,” the 
general said. “I have your letter 
and it has been thoroughly dis- 
cussed. We asked you to come be- 
cause we take it seriously, very 
seriously indeed.” 

“General, I don’t recall ad- 
dressing any of the letters to 
you,” Taylor said quietly. 

“Is that right? Well, I’m sure 
you sent a copy to the Secretary 
of Defense.” 

“It hasn’t yet been delivered.” 

“I see. It doesn’t matter, of 
course, but John, do you know how 
we happened to obtain a copy?” 
“Your courier brought us an un- 
addressed copy,” the lesser gener- 
al said to Taylor. 

Macauley shot a look at Taylor, 
but Taylor merely shrugged. 

“I see. That accounts for it.” 
“Yes.” The general collected his 
thoughts. “Uh, with regard to the 
situation you describe, I take it 
that there have been no new devel- 
opments?” 

Macauley said, “The top of the 
cloud layer was one hundred and 
fifty feet higher on our survey run 
east this morning. There have 
been two major power failures in 
Chicago in the last twelve hours.” 
The aide sitting on the desk said, 
“Power has been restored. Gen- 
eral. Mr. Macauley wouldn’t 
have known that.” 

“Yes,” Soames said. “So the 
outage was temporary, as was 
ours in Washington. But the over- 
all situation remains most seri- 
ous, as you pointed out, Taylor.” 
Taylor asked, “What is going to 



be done? You read my recommen- 
dations?” 

“Oh, yes, and they are being giv- 
en full consideration. However, 
you must realize that the conse- 
quences of such drastic measures 
must be weighed against other 
considerations that are just as 
alarming. Perhaps more so. We 
have a job to do here, too, as I am 
sure you realize. We have to con- 
sider may factors that don’t af- 
fect you in your work in Chica- 
go.” 

“I hope you realize. General 
Soames, that this situation ex- 
tends from west of the Mississip- 
pi to the East Coast,” Macauley 
pointed out. 

“Oh, yes, yes,” the aide on the 
desk said. “There was a thorough 
briefing this morning. The Air 
Force is much aware of the prob- 
lem.” 

“What specifically do you want 
from us?” Taylor asked. 

“All right. Very specifically, 
Taylor, we feel after very careful 
consideration — very careful — that 
the international situation just now 
would make immediate implemen- 
tation of your recommendations, 
as they stand, most undesirable. 
What you suggest would put us in 
a dangerously weakened position. 
That is not to say that certain steps 
cannot be taken, however. We have 
the whole country to consider and 
it may be that by transferring cer- 
tain industrial facilities to less 
affected areas we can substantial- 
ly reduce the hazard. I want you 
to give this very careful consid- 
eration. A massive effort, with 
the Air Force solidly behind you, 
to move power generation, oil re-

fining and other industries away 
from the cities. We feel that you 
are in the ideal position to direct 
such a redeployment — we have 
urged such a course for years and 
you will have our full support. 
You can see how such a move 
would go a long way toward solv- 
ing the impurity problem.” 

Macauley started to speak, but 
Taylor interrupted. “I see. Gen- 
eral Soames — or 1 believe 1 do. 
Let me rephrase it. You feel that 
we at Survey Control can pin- 
point areas in which the genera- 
tion of — er — impurities is mini- 
mal and remove the offending 
plants from those areas where the 
concentration of industries 
causes serious problems. A sort 
of decentralizing strategy. It 
strikes me that this would also 
have the effect of making such in- 
dustries much less susceptible to 
surprise attack.” 

The general leaned forward and 
stared hard into Taylor’s eyes. 
“Taylor, you understand us ex- 
actly. From the military point of 
view, shutting down all these in- 
dustries would create an open in- 
vitation to attack, from within 
as well as from wtthout the coun- 
try. Spreading them out would 
have just the opposite ef- 
fect — and it would go a long way 
toward solving your problem as 
well.” He sat back. “Gentle- 
men — and Miss Uh — I think we 
have accomplished our purpose. 
It has been a most productive 
meeting.” 

The General stood and all stood 
with him. He shook hands all 
around and left, the colonels pre- 
ceding him to hold the door and 

26 



the lesser generals bringing up 
the rear, talking easily to each 
other again. One of them paused 
as he passed Teylor. 

“We’re glad you’re with us, Tay- 
lor,” he said, offering his hand. 

Taylor shook it, saying, “My 
pleasure.” 

The stenographer-aide stood up 
and said, “If you would please 
come with me you may wash up. 
We have dinner for you if you care 
to eat here. 

Macauley said softly to Taylor 
as they filed oyt, “If we did what 
they want th^re wouldn’t be a 
break from the East Coast to the 
Rockies inside a year.” 

“I know — shut up. There won’t 
be in any case.” 

Betty whispered, “Wasn’t he im- 
pressive? 1 was scared to death.” 

Macauley took her arm and 
whispered back, “That was the 
whole point.” 

IV 

A QUESTION OF SURVIVAL 

W fllHIS is the Oval Room,” Ma- 

1 cauley said to Betty. “Presi- 
dent’s secretary in there,” point- 
ing. The plainclothesmen — a new 
pair — left without comment. 

“Do you have the sensation of 
people scurrying around behind 
the walls telling people that we’re 
here?” Macauley asked noboty. 
“So far 1 haven’t seen anyone call 
ahead, but somehow they’re al- 
ways ready for — ” 

The secretary’s door opened. 

George Farrow came out — they 
all recognized him. 

“Thank you for coming,” he 

GALAXY 




said. “Let’s see, you’re Betty 
Hatch, you — Mr. Macauley. And 
you have to be Taylor.” 

He grinned as he shook hands — 
he was black, too. The contrast 
with the reception at the Penta- 
gon was considerable; they were 
at ease. 

“The President will be right 
out,” Farrow said. “He’s on the 
phone.” 

“Who will be here?” 

“Oh, a lot of people from Inte- 
rior, Defense, Commerce and so 
on. Don’t worry, I don’t think 
they’re going to pick on you. They 
just want to find out exactly what 
you think about the situation. It’s 
not a regular cabinet meeting, al- 
though you’ll be in the cabinet 
room. Have you had any dinner?” 

“They gave us a nice dinner at 
the Pentagon,” Betty said. 

Farrow gave her a quick look, 
said, “Excuse me a moment, 
please — ” and disappeared by his 
door. 

Taylor said flatly, “They didn’t 
know we were taken to the Penta- 
gon first. We may find ourselves in 
the middle of something.” 

“Shouldn’t I have said it?” Bet- 
ty asked, worried. 

“It’s all right, Betty, we have 
nothing to hide,” Taylor said. “If 
1 know anything about President 
Holland, though, he’s not going 
to be pleased.” 

“Are you going to tell him about 
the other letters?” Macauley que- 
ried. 

“I don’t think that will be neces- 
sary by now,” Taylor said. 

The secretary came out again. 
“Miss Hatch, gentlemen, the 
President.” 



President Holland strode out 
past Farrow and shook hands 
firmly but quickly. “Hello, Miss 
Hatch, Mr. Taylor, Mr. Macau- 
ley. George has just told me that 
you stopped at the Pentagon. Did 
you talk to Carver or Soames?” 

“Soames, Mr. President,” Tay- 
lor said. “He wants to decentral- 
ize. 1 didn’t tell him why it won’t 
work.” 

“Good. Before we go in, how 
many copies of the letter went 
out — and roughly to whom?” 

“Betty?” 

“Uh, let’s see — I made about 
one hundred and twenty copies, 
one to each Senator, one to each 
Cabinet member and some ex- 
tras loose. And one to you, Mr. 
President.” 

“Why so many, Taylor? Are you 
trying to take this to the public?” 

“■No, Mr. President. But I had to 
make sure that one person or a 
handful couldn’t — lose it. Or at 
least I tried to make sure. No of- 
fense intended.” 

“The Senators didn’t get theirs. 
Your courier left a copy here and 
went next to Interior, where he 
was held.” 

“General Soames appeared to 
have a copy.” 

“Oh. The loose sheets. How did 
you happen to choose an FAA of- 
ficial to carry them?” 

Taylor and Macauley looked at 
each other. 

“FAA official?” Macauley burst 
out. 

Betty said quietly, “The pilot 
must have been injured. He sent 
someone else.” 

“Must be it,” Taylor said. “So 
he probably read a loose copy and 



A CONGREGATION OF VAPORS 



27 




sent it or took it to the Pentagon 
before he went anywhere else. No 
wonder. By the way, 1 know that 
the pilot read a copy. 1 thought he 
was here.” 

Farrow quietly left the room and 
they heard dialing. 

The President said, “All right, 
we know where we are now. Let’s 
join the others in the Cabinet 
Room. Miss Hatch and Mr. Ma- 
cauley, you may attend, but 
please do not comment or ampli- 
fy unless you're directly ques- 
tioned.” 

He led the way. 



S ILENCE fell and the thirty-odd 
people around the large table 
stood as the President entered. 
The President indicated a chair 
near him for Taylor and mo- 
tioned the others to seats farther 
down the table. 

“I see that everyone I asked is 
here,” the President said after 
looking around the room. “Thank 
you. This is Mr. Taylor, director 
of our Chicago Survey Control 
headquarters — his associates, 

M iss Hatch and Mr. Macauley.” 
There were nods and a few hand- 
shakes. 

“This is not a regular Cabinet 
meeting as you can see, but an 
emergency fact-finding session. 
There will be a Cabinet meeting 
later, if warranted. We are here 
because Mr. Taylor has brought 
to a head the problem that has 
been on all our minds for many 
months — or years. 1 invited Mr. 
Taylor and his associates at the 
advice of the Secretary of the In- 
terior, Tom Homer, partly, and 



mainly to get Mr. Taylor’s analy- 
sis of the situation directly, and 
partly — ” he smiled slightly — “to 
keep them from creating any 
more mischief.” 

A chuckle ran around the table. 

“Mr. Taylor feels strongly 
enough about the situation to have 
taken a personal risk in making 
sure his views became known. 
Since he is also as knowledge- 
able as any man in this country 
about what is happening we have 
to take his alarm seriously — per- 
haps even more seriously than 
we take our own, since we see only 
the surface. 

“As President, I have many 
pressing concerns, but if Mr. Tay- 
lor is interpreting his data cor- 
rectly, I am inclined to think that 
this incredible deterioration of 
our environment is the most 
pressing of all. Mr. Cooper?” 

The Secretary of Defense had a 
hand up. 

“Mr. President, we at the De- 
partment of Defense also have se- 
rious concerns, as you know. With 
outsiders present 1 cannot make 
my point fully, but our enemies 
have been following our cloud 
cover closely and they realize 
how near to the danger point we 
are. If we believe that the impuri- 
ty control situation might get out 
of hand in our major cities, we 
must carefully consider the ef- 
fect that this will have in interna- 
tional calculations. We, our- 
selves, may have to launch ener- 
getic measures simply to pro- 
vide breathing space in which to 
tackle the environmental prob- 
lem. 1 understand that this prob- 
lem is very serious, but here we 



28 



GALAXY 




have a plain question of survi- 
val.” 

The President said, “Tom, you 
chair the meeting." 

Homer stood. 

“The question of national de- 
fense is moot of course. I would 
ask my Undersecretary of Im- 
purity Control to comment, but 
he is not available, so let us hear 
from Mr. Taylor right away. Mr. 
Taylor?” 

T aylor rose slowly. “Thank 
you, Mr. Homer. I can't com- 
ment on national defense, but what 
Mr. Cooper has said and what I 
heard this afternoon from Gen- 
eral Soames show that my point 
hasn't been made. It isn't just cloud 
cover out there — it's poison gas, 
just as much as if an enemy had 
sprayed it on us. It isn't getting 
out of control; it is out of control. 
And, Mr. President, we don't have 
here a case of environmental de- 
terioration — those words are used 
so often that one gets the feeling 
that the environment is going to” 
pieces out there while we just stand 
helplessly by and watch it go on. 
That isn't how it’s happening at 
all. 

“What we see going on around 
us is the visible evidence of a war. 
Everyone of us lives in an en- 
vironment that is made up partly 
of his neighbors' waste products. 
A few years ago we had the means 
to get rid of those wastes so they 
didn't stay around long enough to 
be noticeable. Now that situ- 
ation has changed and it's changed 
in such a way that we are all com- 
ing into direct conflict with each 
other. We are beginning to see 



and breathe and taste each others' 
waste products and we can no 
longer get rid of them fast enough. 

“It’s a war because we have 
reached the point where one man 
can't do what he needs to do in or- 
der to survive without doing 
something against the survival of 
other people. We shouldn't look 
at the environment that exists 
between people — we should be 
looking at each individual him- 
self, for it’s what he is doing, not 
what the environment is doing, 
that’s causing the problem. 

“Don't look outside, look in- 
side. Look at this room we're in — 
well-lit, cool, full of fresh air, fresh 
water in the pitchers, all of us 
clean and healthy. How do we 
manage to maintain this state? 
The biologists have known the an- 
swer for a long time. They say that 
life is a process of creating order 
out of disorder — but that can 
happen only by making more dis- 
order somewhere else. We cool 
this room — but we heat up the out- 
side air to do it. And we filter the 
air — but the cooling and the fil- 
tering require electric pow- 
er — and that power requires gen- 
erators and the generators spew 
out smoke and poisonous gases. 
The cleaner we keep our lit- 
tle — bubbles, as my associate 
calls them — the dirtier we make it 
outside and the greater the load 
we put on the filters and coolers. 

“Our problem stems from a ba- 
sic fact of human existence: people 
are not passive victims of their en- 
vironments, but active controllers 
of them. When a man feels cold in 
his house he doesn't just huddle 
under the covers and shiver — he

turns the thermostat higher. If he 
doesn’t have a big enough furnace, 
he goes out and buys a bigger one 
or gets one however he can. If he 
can’t breathe the air he works 
harder until he can buy a filter 
unit for his house. If the water 
pressure falls, he raises it with an 
electric pump; if the voltage goes 
down, he raises it again with a volt- 
age regulator. And that’s the 
problem. Each person is capable 
of finding ways to control the lit- 
tle part of the environment that 
he is interested in — but what he 
does to the rest doesn’t enter his 
calculations. It can’t— we’re 
talking about a lot more than 
comfort now. In six major cities, 
if you lose your filter unit and 
don’t have a respirator nearby, 
you die. 

“If something doesn’t happen to 
change this situation, then follow- 
ing my recommendations won’t 
accomplish a thing. We’ll be right 
back where we are now, but next 
time it won’t take so long. We have 
to find some kind of ordering 
principle that everyone can be- 
lieve in, so that there is more 
awareness of the relationship of 
little self-protecting actions to 
what’s causing the need for them. 
We have to educate the public to 
the fact that their self-protecting 
actions aren’t working, even 
when they seem to work for a 
while. 

“That’s a matter beyond my 
competence — 1 hope i,t isn’t be- 
yond everyone’s competence. 
Right now we are faced with doing 
something to put an immediate 
end to this war of person against 
person. It doesn’t matter what the 
Russians are planning or what 



this means to the Chinese or what 
it does to our credibility with our 
allies. It doesn’t matter, because 
if we project the figures we have 
now just two months ahead--to the 
time when heating of homes and 
offices will have to start — we can 
see that this country will be utter- 
ly disarmed and helpless. That is 
why 1 picked the period of sixty 
days in my recommendations. In 
sixty days, no matter how well we 
cope with the situation now, we 
will have total collapse of all pow- 
er systems. 

“One last thing. We can’t wait. I 
don’t know how close the system 
is running now to the edge of 
disaster and probably nobody 
does. All our major cities are op- 
erating with negative power re- 
serves; they require an input of 
power from the outside twenty- 
four hours a day because their own 
plants are inadequate. The plants 
are inadequate because the air 
and water are so bad that every- 
one has to have devices — but I’ve 
already been through that. On the 
West Coast, they’re closer to the 
edge than we are in the East — it 
may already be too late for the 
Pacific Seaboard. 

“Our predictions are beginning 
to fail — to fall behind the reality. 
The cloud cover is complete over 
the northeast quadrant of the 
country two months ahead of pre- 
dictions; it’s thickening at a rate 
which we can’t possibly explain. 
We failed to see that the comple- 
tion of the cloud cover in the West 
would change the rainfall pattern 
and denude the Rockies of vege- 
tation. There will be more such 
failures — because we have never 

GALAXY

seen anything like this happening 
before. I’m sorry for taking so 
much of your time and telling you 
things you probably already 
know — but for God’s sake, gentle- 
men, Mr. President, there is no 
time left.” 

There was silence for a moment, 
then Homer said, “Thank you, 
Mr. Taylor. I have tried to say 
something similar for years. Mr. 
President?” 

“Not yet, Tom.” 

H omer eyed several hands, then 
called on a person who did not 
have his hand up. “Uh, National 
Science Foundation, Dr. Klaus- 
man?” 

Klausman standing was not 
much taller than his neighbttrs 
sitting. He spoke slowly. 

“Mr. Chairman. Mr. President. 
Laties and chentlemen. Ass Mr. 
Tay-lore has said. Ve do not yet 
understan-t ze proplem. Is iss — no 
doubt-t seeerious.” He paused and 
looked around from under heavy 
eyebrows. 

“Putt! Ve can. Not. Attack it. 
Plindly. Haastil-ly. IG! norantly. It 
iss uuurgent. Zat ve com mence a 
seeerious. Inwestigation. Im — 
meed\a.\.\y He sat down. 

There was an uncomfortable si- 
lence until Homer realized that the 
doctor was finished. 

He said, “Uh, thank you. Doc- 
tor. Yes, Mr. President?” 

“There certainly will be an im- 
mediate investigation. Mr. Taylor 
has not presented us with many 
facts tonight, but I am inclined to 
accept the general tenor of his re- 
marks. The figures in his letter do 
not exactly speak for themselves 



and 1 confess that I had not com- 
prehended their significance 
until tonight. We are indeed un- 
der poison gas attack. Does any- 
one here see any reason to con- 
tinue this meeting before 1 con- 
vene the Cabinet?” 

Five hands shot into the air. 

“I thought not. The immediate 
question is not that of Mr. Tay- 
lor’s persuasiveness, but of the 
facts on which he rests his analy- 
sis. If the facts are exactly as he 
has stated in his letter — and of 
course I have no reason to doubt 
that they are — then I must agree 
that we have here a question of 
survival that goes beyond na- 
tional defense.” There was a loud 
objection from the Secretary of 
Defense. “Later, Bob, at the 
Cabinet meeting. I move to ad- 
journ this gathering. Dr. Klaus- 
man, I want you to name an emer- 
gency panel to go over Mr. Tay- 
lor’s data and analysis.” 

Klausman beamed. “Immeeedi- 
ately, Mr. Presitent. Visin ze 
veek.” 

“No, Doctor, within the hour, 
please. I want them in Chicago no 
later than day after tomorrow.” 
Klausman looked alarmed. He 
fished a sheaf of tattered papers 
out of an inside pocket and wan- 
dered off without saying good- 
bye, muttering, “Valter? Eber- 
hardt? Cardvell?” 

The President pointed to Tay- 
lor, Macauley and Betty and mo- 
tioned them to follow him out of 
the room. 

“I have to convene the rest of the 
Cabinet,” he told them in the Oval 
Room. “Don’t be alarmed at the 
brevity of that meeting. I saw that

the right people were properly 
impressed and that was all I 
wanted. Mr. Taylor, you have my 
thanks — and there will be a letter 
to back that up. Just take it easy 
with those bloodthirsty recom- 
mendations. I’ll take care of the 
Pentagon.” 

He was gone. 

The secretary, Farrow, rescued 
Taylor and his caborts from the 
cluster of questioners that im- 
mediately surrounded them — 
somewhat to Macauley’s disap- 
pointment: he hadn’t had a chance 
to express his opinion. 

“We’ve arranged for immediate 
transportation back to Chica- 
go,” Farrow said. “You'll take the 
Presidential helicopter to 
Wheelis Air Force Base, then an 
Army helicopter to Chicago. 
Your bags will be there.” 

And it was over. 

Over Pennsylvania, under a 
moonless sky, words returned. 

Macauley said, “That’s some 
President. I didn’t even vote for 
him.” 

Taylor nodded. “You know, I 
felt like a wide-eyed teenager af- 
ter it was over.” 

Betty turned in her seat and put 
a hand firmly on his arm, “No, 
Jim. It didn’t look like that at all. 
You said it a lot better than you 
think you did. I was there.” 

“But 1 didn’t — well, thanks. I 
just wonder what they’re going to 
do — and if they’ll do it in time.” 
Later they were awakened by a 
corporal. “Almost there,” he said. 
“We’re setting down at Meigs. 
There’ll be a car.” 

They looked through the win- 
dow and after a while a dull red 

32 



glow appeared in the clouds, light- 
ing them up as if some great fur- 
nace had sp^ed molten slag over a 
thousand square miles of the land 
beneath. As they sank toward the 
glowing layer of pollution Tay- 
lor turned his head away. 

“Shee-/7,” he said quietly, but 
with feeling. “What are they go- 
ing to do?” 

V 

THE SOLUTION 

Y ELLOW-GRAY clouds drifting 
downward on the screen. A red 
dot in the center, sometimes 
breaking up into two. Joe picked 
up the mike. 

“Survey two, are you holding 
fifty-five hundred?” 

“Affirmative.” 

“Survey two, /ncrease altitude to 
six thousand. We are /ojing your 
marker. J?eset calibration.” 
“Roger.” 

"Denver Control, this is Chicago 
Control, over.” 

“Denver Control, over.” 

“We have five, two five zero 
pressure altitude here on a line 
extending west from Chicago 
about three hundred miles.” Joe 
sighed and dropped the singsong. 
“Are you in it yet?” 

“Affirmative. The Long’s Peak 
Station reports continuous cover 
in all directions east of the moun- 
tains. Estimated top, fifty one hun- 
dred, mean sea level. Buildings in 
Denver are still showing through.” 
“Roger, thanks, out.” Joe 
paused. “New Orleans Control, 
this is Chicago Control.” 

“N’y Orleans Control.” 



GALAXY 




“Is your survey plane activated 
yet?” 

“Negative. This afternoon, 
maybe.” 

“Airline reports?” 

“A couple, but there’s not much 
flying. The top seems to be at 
about eleven hundred and slopes 
up north and east. We have a 
tanker report of heavy pollution 
two hundred miles south in the 
Gulf. They’re on radar and loran 
navigation. Oh, the mayor put out 
an order this morning; respirators 
to be provided for all who can’t af- 
ford them, up to four per family. 
We’ve had some deaths.” 

“Roger, I heard that on the 
news. Thanks. Out.” 

Joe scribbled on a pad for a 
while, then braced himself and 
picked up the mike once more. 

“San Francisco Control, this is 
Chicago Control, over.” 

”... isco Control, pardon me, 
go ahead.” 

“We understand your planes are 
grounded again today. Do you 
confirm?” 

“Affirmative, affirmative. Noth- 
ing in or out. We’re down to one 
hundred feet visibility every- 
where. Is this Joe?” 

“Affirm. Who’s this?” 

“Tubby. This will be my last 
shift — I’m getting out. I have 
asthma. There’s still no power. 
We’re on emergency here.” 

“Oh — well, it must be bad.” 
“That’s the word. We have 
martial law in California as of 
this — ” 

The carrier stopped and static 
rushed in the speaker. 

“Frisco, Frisco, Chicago Con- 
trol, over.” 



No reply. Joe picked up a tele- 
phone. 

“Listen, do two things. Get Tay- 
lor up here — Control Room. Oh, 
is he still here? Well, get him up 
quick anyway — this is more im- 
portant. And then raise San 
Francisco Control on the land line 
for me. No, wait. I’ll dial it my- 
self. Get Taylor.” 

He depressed the button, then 
dialed ten numbers. “San 
Francisco operator.” It was a 
male voice. “Flave you a prior- 
ity?” 

“Uh — yes. This is Chicago Sur- 
vey Control. I want our station in 
San Francisco at, uh, nine-seven- 
seven — three-three-oh-three.” 
“Stand by.” Long pause. 

Taylor came through the door 
followed by Macauley and a 
stranger. Joe held them off with a 
palm and flipped on the loud- 
speaker. The operator returned. 

“That exchange is inoperative. 
Stand by.” 

There was another wait, then a 
click and the dial tone returned. 
Joe swiveled around. 

“I had Tubby on the link. Friend 
of mine in Frisco. He said they 
have martial law as of — and then 
they went off the air.” 

“As of when?” Macauley asked. 
“That’s when the carrier quit. I 
don’t know. I think someone 
pulled the plug.” 

Taylor said, “My God!” 

“Some other stuff.” Joe re- 
ferred to his pad. “Denver has it 
this morning, same pressure al- 
titude as here. It’s eleven hundred 
feet in New Orleans and goes at 
least two hundred miles into the 
Gulf.” 



A CONGREGATION OF VAPORS

The stranger said, “That does it. 
From the Rockies to the East 
Coast. It only took fifteen days to 
spread fifteen hundred miles.” 

"Oh, Joe, this is Dr. Cardwell 
from Carnegie. He’s staying on as 
a data analyst. This is Joe Foster, 
Doctor, our chief of survey opera- 
tions.” 

“Glad to meet you, Joe. Do you 
handle the whole operation your- 
self?” 

“Lord, no,” Joe said. He waved 
through the window at the room 
beyond; about half the crew was 
there, sitting before their con- 
soles. “They all do the work. I just 
stick to the hot spots. And we’re 
just aerial survey — downstairs 
are the guys who work from 
ground level up.” 

“Yes, I’ve seen that,” Cardwell 
said. “What about the martial law 
rumor, Jim?” 

“Let’s get on it right from here,” 
Taylor said. “Find some chairs.” 
He picked up the telephone. 

“Barbara, get me the Under- 
secretary — or if he isn’t there, get 
me Mr. Homer. Emergency, you 
can tell them. Oh, wait — ’’ he 
fished out his wallet with one hand 
and flipped it open. “Tell them 
Mr. Sharp is calling. That’s 
right.” 



H e held the phone and put his 
wallet away. “You’re sworn in, 
Joe?” Joe nodded. “That was the 
code for ‘drop everything.’ He 
should answer soon.” 

Joe said, “It’s weird. The cover 
is five thousand to fifty-two hun- 
dred feet pressure altitude from 
Boston to Denver — the only rea- 



son Denver isn’t buried is that the 
ground rises nearly to the top 
there.” 

“We’re getting a handle on 
what’s causing that,” Cardwell 
said. “It’s vtthat astronomers call 
albedo — the percentage of the 
sun’s radiation reflected by a 
planet. These clouds are strongly 
reflective in the visible and in- 
frared, so only about one-fifth of 
the normal solar energy penetrates 
to the ground. And about sixty per- 
cent of the energy is reflected back 
into space, instead of the normal 
thirty percent.” 

“Then why is it so hot?’’ 
Macauley asked. 

“Stored heat, internal heat from 
Earth. That normally radiates 
away, but now it’s reflected, too, 
back down. Actually it’s no hotter 
than it should be this late in 
August, but upstairs things are 
different. There’s a sharp inver- 
sion layer at about five thousand 
feet without nonhomogeneities to 
break it up. And no wind to speak 
of. The jet stream has moved to 
central Canada and the cloud 
layer is preventing the usual 
variations in temperature that 
can drive winds and break up in- 
versions. So here we sit.”. 

“Why does it keep getting 
thicker?” Joe asked. “Say, isn’t 
that call taking a long time?” 

Taylor nodded. “What's up, 
Barbara? Oh? Well, as soon as you 
get them, ring me back.” He 
cradled the receiver. “Still trying 
to raise Washington. We may 
have to go to phone patch again.” 

“Well, we think” Cardwell 
said, “we think it’s simply the re- 
lease of stored heat, the inversion 



34 



GALAXY 




layer and the normal output of 
contaminants, if you can dignify 
contaminants with the word 
‘normal.’ The inversion layer is 
moving upward and underneath 
it normal mixing fills the volume 
as fast as it increases.” He 
shrugged. “Or something. We 
don’t know yet.” 

Taylor picked up the phone and 
said, “Barbara, 1 think I’ll take: 
this in my office. Oh — all right.” 
He sat down with the phone 
propped between shoulder and 
ear. “She got through and they’re 
trying to raise Homer at the White 
House now.” 

There was a brief wait and then: 
“Hello, yes, this is Mr. 
Sharp — hello, Mr. Secretary. 
Taylor. Have you had any recent 
reports from California? Yes, we 
have. The survey station has sus- 
pended transmissions as of — uh — 
fifteen minutes ago. No, sir. Sud- 
denly.” He turned to Joe. “Any 
sign of interference, trouble, be- 
fore that? ” 

“Negative.” 

“Normal, sir. The phrase was 
used, ‘pulled the plug.’ Talking at 
the time, yes, sir. Have you heard 
any rumors — uh, I used the phrase 
advisedly, Mr. Secretary. Per- 
haps — no, I won’t, sir. Perhaps you 
should contact San Francisco 
Control by telephone, sir. By tele- 
phone, yes. Specifically. All right, 
I’ll be here. Good. .” 

“. bye,” he said, hanging up. 
“1 didn’t think I was getting 
through to him and he wasn’t say- 
ing how much they already 
know.” 

“Maybe we ought to find a TV,” 
Macauley said. “They couldn’t 



keep it a secret from the net- 
works.” 

“Hah!” Taylor picked up the 
telephone again. “Barbara, get me 
CBS. Over on McClurg Court. 
Just the switchboard — 1 don’t 
know anyone there.” 

“Jim, is that a good idea?” 
Cardwell said. Taylor looked at 
him. 

“Act first, think later,” he said. 
“I’m getting tired. Barbara, for- 
get it. Yeah, I changed my mind.” 
He put down the phone. 

“It’s hard to sit by and hope 
they’re doing the right thing some- 
where else,” Cardwell said 
sympathetically. Taylor nodded. 
Then he straightened up. 

“Well, we can’t just sit here 
paralyzed,” he said. “We have 
work to do.” 

H e stood up and all the lights 
went out. The control panel 
flickered, but held; a few 
incandescent blubs came to life in 
the ceiling. 

“We’re on standby power,” 
Macauley said. He reached over 
and picked up the telephone. 
“Barbara? Good, it’s still work- 
ing. Barbara, we have a power fail- 
ure, will you see that all personnel 
are alerted and announce that 
everyone is to have respirators at 
standby? Do you have any light? 
Good. Don’t let anyone call home 
yet — we have to keep this line open 
for a call from Washington. An- 
nounce yellow alert, too. Right.” 
He hung up. 

Joe nipped an intercom switch 
and said, “Power failure, men. Get 
your respirators out and keep 
them handy. We’re still opera- 



A CONGREGATION OF VAPORS

tional.” There were some waves 
from the men at the consoles. 

The phone rang and Taylor 
picked it up. “Taylor here.” He 
listened for awhile, then said, 
“Okay, we’ll just have to wait.” He 
put the phone down again. “She 
tried to set up a line with the Wash- 
ington operator and there’s no 
answer. She’s trying to get a dif- 
ferent routing on the line.” 

The radio came to life. “Chicago 
Control, this is Baltimore, over.” 
Joe answered. “Chicago.” 
“Chicago, 1 have a phone patch 
for you from Washington. The 
land lines are out.” 

“Roger, Baltimore, go ahead.” 
There was a click, then a new voice. 

“Hello, this is the White House 
operator, Mr. Sharp, please?” 

Joe handed the microphone to 
Taylor, turned off the phone 
speaker, plugged in earphones, 
which he handed to Taylor. 

Taylor said, “Yes, this is Mr. 
Sharp. All right. Hello? Oh — yes, 
sir. Yes sir, we’re operational, but 
we’ve had a power — all right, sir. 
One moment.” Taylor turned to 
Joe, a strange look on his face. 
“Joe, could you raise Kirjland Air 
Force Base in Albuquerque?” 

Joe thought. “We’d have to be 
awfully lucky,” he said. “Can you 
get us a frequency near the one 
we’re using?” 

Taylor said into the phone, “Sir, 
we need to know a calling 
frequency near our normal 
frequency. Sir, there are others 
here. Yes, all sworn in. Ail right.” 
He waited, pulled over a pad and 
picked up a pen. He wrote. “All 
right, 1 have it. Thanks — goodbye. 
Taylor again, sir, we’re working 

36 



on it. Will you hold?” He turned to 
Joe. “What about it, Joe?” 

“I’ll have to ask the chief 
engineer. Be right back.” Joe took 
the pad, left the room and reap- 
peared on the other side of the win- 
dow. He strode to a far desk and 
spoke to a man sitting there. In a 
moment the left by another door 
and Joe came back. 

“Andy says he can do it,” Joe 
said. “He’ll have to retune the 
transmitter, receiver and antenna, 
but it won’t take long; this station 
has already been changed to differ- 
ent frequencies a couple of times.” 
In a moment the monitor screens 
went to snow. Taylor said, “Wait, 
Joe, how can we keep the link with 
Baltimore?” 

Joe grinned. “We can. Stop 
worrying, boss. 1 can do the re- 
laying right from here.” 

The man beyond the window 
came back and waved. Joe picked 
up an operator’s microphone, 
plugged it in, adjusted it around 
his neck and put on earphones. 
“See, I listen with the phones and 
work the switch to connect Wash- 
ington to Kirtland. If we can raise 
them.” 

He toggled a switch. “Kirtland 
Air Force Base, this is Chicago 
Survey Control, do you read, 
over?” 

A reply came faintly through 
noise. “Kirtland, over.” 

“Kirtland, I have emergency 
traffic. We are a fixed frequency 
station, can you retune? This is an 
emergency.” 

“Stand by, Chicago.” 

After a pause, Kirtland came in 
loud and clear. 

“Chicago, state the nature of 

GALAXY 




the emergency.” 

Joe said, “The President of the 
United States wants to talk to — " 
Taylor was waving. “Command- 
ing officer,” he said. Joe nodded. 
“To the commanding officer of 
the base.” 

Another voice came on. “This is 
the O.D. We have no notification 
of such a call.” Joe silently handed 
the mike to Taylor. 

“This is James Taylor, director 
of Chicago Survey Control. 1 
have the President on the line and 
he has requested a phone patch to 
your commanding officer. 
Wait — ” he listened to his ear- 
phones. “The President wants to 
speak to ‘Wet-pants’ Blake.” 

“Stand by.” There was a wait, 
and the first voice came back. 



T aylor handed the micro- 
phone back to Joe, who held 
the talk button in and counted sec- 
onds to himself. When he let it up 
the voice came in clearly. 

“You're in luck, Chicago, we 
have a good skip. The patch is in.” 
Joe pointed to Taylor. 

“Mr. President, the patch is 
ready and 1 presume the com- 
manding officer will be on short- 
ly. Thank you. Do you want to wait 
or be connected now? All right. 
This is not a secure line, Mr. 
President. Oh, 1 see. All right.” He 
handed the microphone to Joe, 
who unplugged it and threw some 
switches. 

The loudspeaker said, “Chicago, 
General Blake will be on the line 
in a moment.” 

Joe flipped a switch, waited and 
flipped it back. 



“Ohmygawd. U mean, yes, sir, 
Mr. President.” 

( ) 

“Spiegel, sir. I’m glad to meet 
you, too, sir. Uh, here’s General 
Blake.” 

Blake’s voice said, “Hello, Fred. 
That was a hell of a password.” 

( ) 

“Sure, we’re in contact with 
them, three ways. No operations, 
though — they’ve been socked in for 
a week.” 

( ) 

“We could refuel a copter at 
Reno and base the search there. 1 
can tell you now there’s nothing to 
see — it’s solid to seven thousand 
feet west of the Rockies.” 

( ) 

“1 see, I suppose Edwards would 

be the place. 1 can’t believe it, 
though. There has to be an ex- 
planation. Didn’t they get any- 
thing from Portland or Seattle?” 

( ) 

“That’s crazy, Fred. You can’t 
lose contact with a whole state. 
Listen, Fred, I’ll go ahead and or- 
der the helos out, but I’m going to 
get on our secure lines to Edwards 
and see what they have to say. Why 
didn’t you call me that way?” 

( ) 

“Well, what the hell can Soames 
do? You’re still Commander-in- 
Chief, aren’t you?” 

( ) 

When Blake came back he 
sounded deadly serious. “There’s 
only one thing to do. Divert the 
power and shut down the secure 
lines. If Soames could hear me he’d 
shit, but That’s what I’d do. We 
never figured that the emergency 
power would be needed for pre-

serving life, but here we are.” 

( ) 

“Well, we can't live with it, but 
we can’t live without it either. If 
it’s as bad as you say the country 
is wide open anyhow. We can’t 
keep that a secret for another 
hour. I’ll try to raise Edwards 
now, but the chances are that 
they’ve discovered the same thing. 
I hope they kept at least one line 
up. I’ll get back to you this way as 
soon as I know anything. 
Fred — well, out.” 

Joe spoke quickly into the 
microphone. “Mr. President, this 
is Chicago: I had to listen, sir, to do 
the switching. Can I tell Mr. Tay- 
lor? . Yes, sir. Only that. We’ll 
stand by on Kirtland’s frequency, 
yes, sir — but sir, we may not be 
able to hold it. We had a lucky 
skip. I don’t know, sir — one hour, 
two hours. You can’t tell. No, sir, 
only one frequency at a time. Yes, 
sir, 1 would recommend that. 
Thank you.” He switched and 
said, “Baltimore, we are finished 
for the time being. Stand by on this 
frequency from now on, over.” 
“Roger, Chicago, out.” 



J OE turned around. “California is 
in trouble. I guess you got that. 
I’m not supposed to get more 
specific. But there’s something 
you have to know: power’s down 
everywhere from here to Wash- 
ington. The President has ordered 
all emergency generators, civilian 
and military, to be diverted to run- 
ning emergency filter units. Our 
orders are to stay on the air and 
stay operational.” 

“I can guess the rest,” Cardwell 



said. “It’s pretty clear that the 
Pentagon is fighting to keep 
security going and the President is 
shutting down their communica- 
tions to keep them from going off 
half-cocked. Although I suppose 
they can contribute a substantial 
amount of standby power.” 

Macauley said, “I think we may 
have a problem, too.” He sniffed 
significantly. 

Taylor said, “We may be here a 
long time, so we had better try to 
keep this floor, or part of it, clean. 
Joe, get your men together and see 
how long we could operate one 
filter unit for this floor — and the 
cafeteria freezer — just on the 
emergency power unit. And stay 
operational, of course.” A 
thought struck him. “My God, 
there are ten thousand people in 
this building. Let’s get our office 
people into respirators and send 
them downstairs. There won’t be 
any elevators. Make sure everyone 
below knows what to expect, and 
try to get them to go home.” 

The telephone rang. Taylor said, 
“Cardwell, will you take over the 
evacuation? This is bound to be 
more trouble.” Cardwell nodded 
and left. 

The telephone said, “Chicago 
Survey Control?” 

“Yes.” 

“This is Denver Survey. You 
must have the last working line in 
the country. I have a phone patch 
for you from your Survey Two; he 
can’t raise you.” 

“Go ahead, we can’t receive 
him.” 

There was some clicking and a 
new voice came on. “Survey, this 
is Survey Two, over.”

GALAXY 




“Survey Two, this is Taylor. Is 
this Bates or Peterson?” 

“Bates. I have an emergency re- 
port — I wish 1 could show it to you. 
Survey Four has been trying to 
raise you, too, probably about the 
same thing.” 

“Go ahead. I’m recording.” 
Taylor waved at Joe, who reach- 
ed over and started the telephone 
recorder. The loudspeaker went 
bleep. 

“Roger. I’m at nine thousand 
five hundred feet over the 
Mississippi River, 1 reckon, about 
sixty miles south of Moline. 1 don’t 
know exactly — the Rockford 
omni has quit. As near as I can tell 
the cloud top is averaging about six 
thousand feet, repeat, six thousand 
feet. And the damndest thing is 
happening to it!” The voice sound- 
ed shaken, but steadied as it went 
on. “I can see a vague sort of line 
running north and south; east of 
the line the color of the clouds is a 
dark orange and west it’s the same 
color as before, sort of dirty yel- 
low. It isn’t really a sharp line; I’m 
over it now; but there’s a gradual 
change — the orange bulges out 
ahead in places and then fills in be- 
tween the bulges, while more 
bulges are starting. It’s sort of 
creeping along, not very fast. Say, 
ten knots. What the hell is it?” 

T aylor dosed his eyes and sat 
down. “Survey Two, we must 
get pictures. Give us about five 
minutes to reset our receivers. 
Start transmitting now, with range 
marker in the infrared.” 

“Roger. By the way, I can see a 
big bulge sticking up over the hori- 
zon where Chicago is.” 



“Okay, Two. And empty your 
sample bottles, we’ll have to have 
some of that. Out.” 

He saw Joe through the control 
room window and knocked on it. 
Joe went to an intercom and ask- 
ed, “What is it?” Taylor looked at 
the console and gave up. He 
beckoned Joe to come. 

“Joe, we’ve got to get the 
telemetry going again; something 
is happening up there. Get on it, 
quick.” Joe left immediately. In a 
few minutes the snow left the 
screens and a moment later Joe’s 
voice came over the intercom. 
“You’re go.” Taylor picked up the 
mike. 

“Survey Two, Survey.” 

“Survey Two, that was quick. 
Got the picture?” 

“Affirmative and recording. 
Give us a continuous run along the 
demarcation and a slant right 
down into it. Then take a sample 
east of the line, one in it and one 
west of it. Then find a place to put 
down — anywhere. We’ll get you 
back to base. We have to have 
those samples.” 

“Roger, I’ll let you know when 1 
find a field. Out.” 

“Two, wait. Use respirators and 
oxygen on that sample run — got 
that?” 

“Affirmative. Out.” 

The orange on the screen 
blended into the dirty yellow, as 
the pilot had described it. As the. 
plane came closer to the clouds the 
line became more and more indis- 
tinct until only a smooth color 
could be seen, an occasional 
whisp of orange in it. Then the pic- 
ture became murky and gradually 
turned deep orange. ^

“Sample one, east,” the pilot 
said. “Turning west. This stuff 
itches. Sample two. Just stings a 
little, but I’m glad we’re on 
oxygen. Sample three, west and 
climbing.” 

“Go west and find a spot to 
land,” Taylor said. “Can you 
advise where that will be?” 

“Affirmative, Grand Island is 
above minimums and I can make it 
with twenty minutes’ reserve. See 
you later.” 

“Thanks, Bates. You be sure to 
get down safely. We need those 
samples as much as we need you.” 
“Moochos gracias,” the answer 
came back. “Out.” 

Joe came in and looked at the 
screen. The pilot was climbing 
again and the orange-to-yellow 
transition was clear. “What’s 
thatl" 

“We’ll play it back later, Joe. 
Give us about five minutes more of 
this and then get back on Kirt- 
land’s frequency.” Joe left again. 

Cardwell came in the door about 
half an hour later. “Jim, some- 
thing weird is happening out- 
side — you have to see this.” 

“I think 1 can guess,” Taylor 
said. “Wait a minute and let me re- 
wind these tapes. We’ve had a re- 
port from Survey Two forty-five 
minutes ago about a new 
phenomenon on top. Tm glad 
you’re here. I have a notion of what 
we’re looking at, but I’d rather 
hear your opinion first. There we 
are, now watch.” 

T he same picture appeared and 
ran through its sequence, with 
both ends of the conversation re- 
playing too. Cardwell sat silently 



until the plane made its run down 
toward the clouds. 

“That’s enough,” he said. “I’m 
glad you thought of the samples.” 
Taylor said, “Recognize the 
color?” 

“Yeah. Safety fuel. I’ve seen a 
thousand contrails that color.” 

“So have 1. Oh, you didn’t get 
the earlier part on audio tape: the 
cover’s up to about six thousand 
and the line is creeping west. Does 
that tell you anything?” 

“Maybe. The higher it goes, the 
more ultraviolet there is from the 
sun. Maybe some reaction be- 
tween the safety fuel combustion 
products and the stuff in the air, 
catalyzed slowly by UV light. If 
that’s it, the line will be creeping 
west all the way to the Rockies.” 
“What did you want me to see?” 
Taylor asked. 

“Oh — it’s all orange outside. 
That tells us something — the 
material absorbs in the blue and 
far red. If it were selective re- 
flectivity, we’d probably see blue 
light coming through. Apparent- 
ly the color change started several 
hours ago, maybe even last night, 
but nobody noticed it. It may not 
be important.” 

“Survey Four had instrument 
troubles this morning and didn’t 
get going until after we went off 
the air. No way to tell, then, unless 
an airline has something aloft.” 
“Not likely. I hope not, any- 
way — this power failure is a dilly, 
and there isn’t an open airport 
anywhere east of us. 1 got a snatch 
of news when we were herding 
people downstairs.” 

“How are they taking it?” 
“Worried about the people at 



40 



GALAXY 




home, most of them. They were 
glad to go. The building superin- 
tendent has his people out directing 
traffic, too; we met them two 
floors down.” 

“All right, then that’s off my 
mind for now. How is it out on the 
streets?” 

“Can’t say. One of the girls from 
an office below called home be- 
fore the phones quit — where’s 
Downer’s Grove?” 

“Southwest, I guess, about 
twenty miles.” 

“No power there. Don’t small 
towns generally have their own 
power stations around here?” 

“Some do, some don’t. 1 doubt 
that they could keep power up 
without input from the city, 
though,” Taylor said. “And with- 
out power from the grid there’s 
going to be one hell of a time try- 
ing to restart. If the failure was 
caused by a severe undervoltage, 
then it was probably something 
like a million burned out refrigera- 
tor motors that triggered it to 
failure. How are they going to re- 
start with all those loads still across 
the line?” 

Cardwell said, “This could be 
very bad. How long ago did the 
lights go out?” 

“A little less than two hours. 
Hour and a half. It’s too early to 
get panicky, but we’d better start 
warming up for it.” 

“We have to find a radio, at 
least — there has to be some in- 
formation. This is enough to drive 
you crazy. Chicago might as well 
be a hundred miles away, for all 
we know about what’s happening 
down on the street.” 

Macauley came in. “We’re in 



good shape on the power. This 
place was designed to run by itself 
for a long time. We can hold the 
filter units on this floor and the 
walk-in freezer in the cafeteria 
downstairs. There’s a stairwell 
for access and the boys are seal- 
ing it off so we can maintain clear 
air right down to the freezer. No- 
tice that the air’s better now?” 

The radio spoke. “Chicago, this 
is Kirtland.” 

Macauley went to the panel. 
“Kirtland, go ahead.” 

“We have a call for the 
President.” 

“Roger, Kirtland, stand by.” 

T aylor said, “Call Joe,” then 
spotted him through the window 
and knocked. Joe finished a last 
word with several men and came. 

“Kirtland, Joe. No sense 
burdening too many people with 
secrets. Kirtland is standing by.” 
“Right,” Joe said. “Baltimore, 
this is Chicago Survey Control, 
over.” 

“Chicago, Baltimore, go 
ahead.” 

“White House line for the 
President.” 

“Roger, we’re holding the con- 
nection. Stand by.” 

Joe flipped switches, put on ear- 
phones and waited. In a moment 
he said, “Kirtland, the President is 
ready.” 

“Fred, are you on?” came 
Blake’s voice; Joe went back to his 
switching. 

( ) 

“I have some very bad news.” 

( ) 

“No, we aren’t in contact with 
Edwards. The helos will be there 



A CONGREGATION OF VAPORS

in another hour. Edwards must 
have diverted power, too, they’d 
have responsibility for Pasadena at 
least. This is something else. The 
Navajo.” 

( ) 

“That's right. On the way to 
Reno. Apparently they had no 
respirators. Nobody thought of 
them and they didn’t ask for help. 1 
can’t imagine why. The helo pilot 
made a low run and saw people, 
sheep, dogs, birds — ’’ his voice 
faded and Joe switched, paused, 
switched back. 

( ) 

“Absolutely none he could see. 
Nobody. He set down in Tuba 
City but the houses there didn’t 
even have filter units. No sense in 
staying — he’s probably setting 
down in Reno by now. Its almost 
as if they had decided — I’ll send 
more helos, of course. We don’t 
know the extent of it. But 1 
thought you should know right 
away.” 

( ) 

“Yes, I’ll report later. Goodbye, 
Fred.” 

Joe turned around and tried to 
say something, but only succeed- 
ed in clearing his throat. 

“Never mind, Joe,” Macauley 
said. “We got it.” 

Joe turned back. “Kirtland, the 
President has disconnected. Out.” 
“Roger, Chicago: Hell of a 
thing. Out.” 

’’Let’s find that radio,” Cardwell 
said. 

They did better after some 
searching and a lot of haywiring. 
A television set was brought up 
from a lower floor by an electrician 
in a respirator and was patched 



into the intercom system so 
everyone could hear if not see. The 
Emergency Broadcast Network 
was on the air. 

A n announcer sat at a 

table, a single camera on him 
dead front, papers stacked left and 
right of him, the microphone 
boom low in the picture. 

“The above food distribution 
centers will also begin receiving 
supplies of replacement face 
mask filters of several types, as 
well as a few respirators. To re- 
plenish a filter when no replace- 
ments are available, do the fol- 
lowing — get pencil and paper and 
write these ingredients down. 

“One half pound table salt. One 
half pound baking soda or 
bicarbonate of soda. Aluminum 
foil. Line a bowl with the foil and 
dissolve the soda and salt — hot 
water, if possible. Pour the solu- 
tion into the bowl and place, used 
filters into the liquid. Stir very 
gently for ninety minutes in cold 
water or twenty minutes in very 
hot water. Be very careful not to 
crack the filters — they are brittle 
and when cracked are useless. 
Caution — the used solution is poi- 
sonous, so dispose of it carefully. 
Do not pour it down a drain — the 
water supply could be endangered. 
Pour it onto dirt or grass where it 
will soak into the ground. Re- 
member, the solution is very 
poisonous after several filters 
have been processed. Discard and 
make a fresh solution after fifteen 
filters have been processed.”

“Jim — we knew the poor people 
would be hit hard and first.” 

Taylor, controlling himself, said, 
“It sounds as though they’re 
closing certain ones down before 
others.” 

“But we don’t know why.” 

Taylor picked up his sandwich. 
“No. We don’t.” He ate, con- 
centrating on the food. 

The announcer was saying, “It is 
now expected that power will be 
restored in the downtown area 
some time after midnight tonight. 
Other sections of the city will ex- 
perience a restoration of power 
when the Midwest grid returns to 
operation.” 

Cardwell said, “Every hour they 
move it two hours back. As far as I 
can tell there’s still no power any- 
where in the city. Or anywhere 
else, for that matter.” 

Joe appeared at the office door. 
“Mr. Taylor?” 

Taylor rose and went wit^h him. 
“Come along, you two. It may be 
word about Survey Four.” 

They went to the control room; 
the White House was on the line. 
Taylor talked briefly to someone 
and then Joe put through the link 
to Kirtland. The signal was weak 
but readable. 

Taylor, said, “Mac, the 
President’s secretary asked if we 
had been contacted by any local 
authorities. I said no. He advised 
us to stay under wraps here. It 
seems that there were some riots in 
Chicago that didn’t get talked 
about over the Emergency Net. 
The police didn’t come out of it too 
well. Neither did the rioters. Some- 
one started grabbing masks and 
the police started shooting. The 



National Guard has had massive | 
desertions — those guys live 
around here or downstate and they, 
went after their families.” 1 

Macauley sifid, “Could they 
have shut down the shelters in re- 
taliation?” j 

Taylor said, “Mac, I’m not 
going to think about that. Neither^ 
are you. If I think about it I’ll find 
a gun and go out after some- j 
body — and it may not be any- 
where near the truth. We’re in here 
for the duratipn.” 

Kirtland finally came on the line 
and Blake spoke. He sounded ex- 
hausted. 

“Fred, we got the helos through. 
Edwards is out of commission,^ 
They’re holed up in a couple of 
hangars with a mob of civilians and 
all the power on the base is being 
used to run filters and refrigera- 
tors. They’ll be out of food in three 
days. We’re going to airlift in 
what we have — but there’s a whole 
city here that has to survive. We 
don’t have full cloud cover yet, but 
filter units are necessary. We’ve 
lost all power input from the Den- 
ver grid. Is it possible to reactivate 
any of the secure lines? We must 
communicate with other military 
bases.” 

( ) 

“I can’t decide that, Mr. 
President. That’s you, Fred. You 
wouldn’t advise us to ignore the 
outside world, would you?” 

( ) 

“I’ve set that up already. Every 
flyable plane at Edwards will be 
out of there tonight with as many 
people as possible — but that’s only 
something like a thousand or 
twelve hundred. We’ll never get

transports back in there. No 
radar. No ILS. No nothing. We 
could hardly find the base. But 
you didn’t answer my question. 
Are you telling me that we should 
go it alone here?” 

“1 see. White Sands, too, 1 
suppose, and Alamogordo. I don’t 
know why you think this kind of 
military concentration is the hope 
of the future, but 1 see your point, 
//you’re right. If you’re right we’ll 
try to be around to pick up the 
pieces. No word from abroad?” 

( ) 

“So everyone s waiting to pick 
up the pieces. Well, Fred, it’s a 
God damned shitty world. Out.” 
His voice had turned bitter and 
angry. 



T he frequency was cleared. Tay- 
lor sat back and said, “1 guess 
that goes for everyone. We’ll try 
to be around to pick up the pieces. 
Who’s that?” 

A voice in the hall outside called, 
“Hello, is anybody here?” 

A knock came on the door. 
Macauley opened it and Betty 
stood there beside a large suit- 
case. 

“Betty, what are you doing 
here?” he said. 

“Hey, it’s everybody,” Betty 
said weakly. “We ran out of 
filters — that’s what we’re doing 
here. We brought all the cans we 
could carry. There are so many 
dead people — ” she broke down 
and was eased into a chair, where 
she sobbed while Macauley held 
her. 



Peggy Orth from the typing 
pool?” 

“Sure, Betty — why don’t you 
just take it easy.” 

“1 looked back and saw some- 
one grab her mask and run with it. 
She tried to ho — hold her breath as 
lo — long as she c-c-could — ” 

Macauley and Taylor looked at 
each other over her head. After a 
while Betty sat up and wiped at her 
eyes. “Oh,” she said, “I’m so glad 
to see you guys. And you have air 
and light. It’s just pitch black 
everywhere outside. We had to 
practically feel our way here.” 

“Betty, ‘we’ who?” Taylor 
asked. 

“There were four of us rooming 
together. We all came back when 
we couldn’t find any filters. We 
were really scared until we re- 
membered that there was emergen- 
cy power here.” 

Macauley hefted the bag. “Did 
you climb forty flights of stairs 
with thisT' he asked. 

Betty nodded and started to cry 
again. 

“Darn it, I can’t stop. Don’t say 
anything nice to me f-for a while.” 
She took a deep breath. “Is there 
any water?” 

Joe said, “Come along, Betty, 
I’ll show you. We’re getting it 
from the fire-fighting reservoir. 
Where are the other girls?” 

“They went into the office.” 

Macauley said, “I’ll come 
along — we have to get some more 
bedding up here for them.” 

They left. 

Later the office furniture that 
had served as a cafeteria was 
pushed aside and bedding was 
brought in; a miseellaneous collec- 



“Oh, Mac, do you remember

tion of sofa cushions, cushions 
from chairs, odd-shaped pillows 
and a pile of brand-new blankets. 
Betty had pulled four “beds” into 
her own office, next to Taylor’s, 
and was making them up. The 
other girls were sitting on cushions, 
talking to some of the men. Taylor 
went into his office and came back 
holding two bottles. 

“A-hem,” he said. “Do I have 
your undivided attention?” He 
did. Someone went to the water 
cooler and started pulling out pa- 
per cups and handing them around. 
Taylor went around the room, 
pouring carefully; Betty held his 
for him and he put the bottle 
down on a desk. He took his cup 
and looked around. 

“Watch out, this stuff is hun- 
dred proof. Ladies and gentlemen, 
let’s drink to our poor country.” 

A couple of the men stood up 
and silence fell. 

Taylor stared into his cup. “I’m 
not going to make a speech, but 
perhaps I’d better sum up where 
we are. There are sixteen of us. 
We are apparently the only link 
operating tonight between the 
White House and the last relative- 
ly unaffected area in the South- 
west. Now .don’t get the idea that 
we’re the last ones on Earth — we 
aren’t and we won’t be. But if you 
wonder why we’re holing up here 
while the city tears itself to pieces 
around us, remember this. If ev- 
eryone in all of the larger cities 
dies tonight or in the days to fol- 
low, there will be only about thirty 
million people left in this country. 
There won’t be any industry or 
public utilities or operating food 
storage facilities. It’s our job to 



provide a communication link so 
that when this is over — and it wil 
be over — there will still be some 
kind of government and the people 
in it will know what is going on 
and be ready to act. There's a lot 
that can be done — the nuclear 
power plants are intact, the basic 
stuff we need to start our civiliza- 
tion up again is intact. Nobody 
knows just yet how bad it’s going 
to be, but you have to be ready to 
face a country in which seven, 
eight or nine people out of ten will 
be lying dead in the streets when 
we come out. It could be that bad 
— and we have to be ready.” 
Someone in the back of the 
room spoke up; “Mr. Taylor, 
Chicago is burning. Shall I turn 
it up?” 

Taylor grimaced. “No. Not for 
me. 1 know which part is burn- 
ing.” 

He picked up the bottle and 
started around the room again. 

Macauley said, “1 agree. If we 
listen to that twenty-four hours a 
day we’ll all go crazy.” 

The man in the back of thf 
room said, “Hey — ” he turner 
the volume on the intercom uj 
and a rushing sound could be 
heard. “They went off the air!” 
“That settles that,” Cardwel 
said and tossed down his drink 
He went to sit next to Taylor 
who was on a cushion with hi; 
back to the wall. “Jim, you don’ 
know which part is burning. I sus- 
pect that all of it is burning.”

orange-lit and bright; three walls 
were intact, but there were black- 
ened timbers above and on the side 
toward the TV room. Through 
the door to the TV room could 
be seen the house next door, gut- 
ted. Tim peered out through the 
front door, which was ajar, eased 
it shut and then went into the 
kitchen. The kitchen had burned 
partially. Tim returned with a 
coil of clothesline and went back 
into the basement, first restoring 
the front door to its original posi- 
tion. Mike tagged along after him 
back to the workroom. 

“Mother, when is Daddy com- 
ing back?” Judy asked. 

“Oh, he should be back soon,” 
Grace replied, not looking up. 

“Could 1 have a drink?” 

“No, honey, wait and see what 
Daddy brings back.” 

“All right.” Judy focused on 
the comic book again. 

From the other room Tim said, 
“We’ll have • to file a couple of 
notches in the window frame.” 
The sound of a wood rasp follow- 
ed shortly. 

The toddler awoke and cried 
feebly. Grace rose quickly and 
went to her, kneeling and putting 
a hand on her forehead, above the 
mask. 

“I hope he finds some aspirin 
today,” she said. “Mommy’s here, 
baby. Oh, you’re so sore!” She 
pulled the edge of the mask away 
from an inflamed line along the 
child’s cheek. 

Grace went to a low shelf, took 
a glass. She kneeled at the water 
heater, putting the glass down un- 
der the drain spigot. She held a 
rag over the spout and let some 



water through into the glass. Then 
she went back to the bed and 
helped the toddler sit up. 

“Remember, honey — real quick 
and hold your breath.” The little 
head nodded. Grace slipped the 
lower elastic up behind the child’s 
head, raised the mouthpiece and 
held the glass there. The child took 
a few quick swallows, then the 
mask was pressed back while she 
panted and coughed. “Once more, 
honey.” 

Judy watched for a moment and 
licked her lips. Then she turned 
silently back to the comic book. 
Grace lowered the toddler back 
onto the bed. 

“’nother pillow, honey?” The 
snout of the small mask waved 
sideways, no. 

Grace kneeled there until the 
child slept again. When she rose 
Tim was watching. 

“Is she any better?” 

“I think so,” Grace said. She 
wiped tears from her eyes with the 
heels of her hands and went back 
to the table. 

T im looked down at the sleep- 
ing form for a moment longer, 
turned and went purposefully back 
to the workroom. 

“All right, Mike,” his voice 
said, “you hold this end while 1 
feed the rest through.” 

Mike said, “Look, the fan’s 
going by itself!” 

Tim said, “I wish it would. 
That’s Just the wind. Hurry up, 
we have to get the filter back in.” 
Grace picked up her sewing, but 
her eyes were on the toddler. She 
began to weep again silently; then 
she clasped her hands around the

GALAXY 




cloth and lowered her head, her 
lips moving. 

She was dozing in her chair 
when Tim shook her shoulder. 

“Mom, come look.” She looked 
around, dazed. “Mom, it seems 
to work. 1 tried it without my 
mask. Come on.” 

She rose and went with him. 
Two lines of clothesline came out 
of the window frame, passed over 
two pulleys and were wrapped sev- 
eral times around a hose reel 
mounted on a wooden stand. Tim 
pulled a chair into place, put his 
feet on the handles and began to 
pedal. A breeze came to life at 
the filter in the window, ruffling 
Grace’s hair. 

“At least we can keep this room 
clear — maybe the whole base- 
ment,” Tim said. “Take off your 
mask.” He undid his and put it 
down; Grace gasped and held out 
her hand. Tim’s face was joyous 
and he breathed in deeply. “It’s 
all right.” 

Grace’s hands trembled as she 
undid her mask. It came off. The 
air was fresh. 

“Timmy!” she said. “What a 
wonderful thing for the baby — we 
can move her in here!” Tears 
sprang into Tim’s eyes; he bent 
his head and kept pedaling. 

They moved the little one in 
and then back again when an 
hour’s pedaling by Tim, Mike and 
Judy proved to clear the whole 
basement. They wouldn’t give 
Grace a turn. 

“Let us do it,” Tim said. “You 
have to do other things. Anyhow, 
I want to see how long we can 
stop before we smell anything.” 

They stopped pedaling and 



Tim tucked a blanket over the fil- 
ter. For an hour they waited, then 
two. Finally Judy coughed. 

“I can smell it,” she said. 
“We’d better start again.” 

Tim went in and removed the 
blanket and turned to see Mike 
ready to pedal. 

“Let me go first,” Tim said. 
“I’m strongest.” 

“No,” Mike said, pedaling. 
“It was your turn last.” 

“Okay, Tarzan, let me know 
when you’re tired. Do it slower — 
if it will last for two hours we 
don’t need that much air coming 
in.” 

The basement door knob rat- 
tled. 

“Daddy!” Judy cried and ran 
to the steps. Tim went past her, 
putting on his respirator. He mo- 
tioned her back, climbed the steps 
and unbolted the door. Pete stood 
there with two supermarket bags 
in his arms. 

“Hi, Tim. Take these. I’ve got 
two more in the little wagon out- 
side.” 

Tim took the bags and went 
down, depositing them on the ta- 
ble. He removed his mask. In a 
moment they heard the door open 
and then close again, quickly. 
With a rattling of stiff paper, 
Pete came down the steps. He 
took one look at Tim and dropped 
his bags on a bed, starting for- 
ward. Then he saw Grace without 
her mask, then Judy and finally 
Mike, pedaling in the workroom. 
Everyone was grinning. 

S LOWLY he undid his mask 
and took it off, ready to clap 
it back on instantly. He sniffed

the air. His face began to break 
up. He went to Tim, half laugh- 
ing and half crying, and clasped 
him tightly in his arms. 

“Oh, boy,” he said. “Oh, boy, 
what a kid.” 

Tim said, muffled, “It wasn’t 
in time. Dad. But it works.” 

Pete held Tim by the shoulders 
at arm’s length. “Listen, Tim, 
maybe you don’t know what this 
means to me. It means 1 don’t 
have to take filters from dead peo- 
ple any more. For that I thank 
you.” 

“Daddy, did you get pop?” 
Judy asked. 

Pete went to the bags. “Yep. 
And aspirin. And some of the 
driest bread you’ve ever seen. And 
extra filters.” His face sobered. 
“Lots of other stuff — there aren’t 
many people picking over the 
ruins any more.” 

Grace said, “Pete, give me the 
aspirin.” She took it, ran some 
water and gently woke the toddler, 
who was sleeping on her back, 
easily. 

“Here, honey, here’s a pill and 
some water to make you feel bet- 
ter.” 

The child nodded, then closed 
her eyes, took a deep breath and 
held it. 

Grace laughed. “Honey, you 
don’t have to do that today. Just 
take it,” she said. 

In the workroom Tim said, 
“My turn, Mike.” 

Judy sprang up. “No, mine, 
mine — ” And Tim came back 
with Mike, caught Pete’s eye, 
smiled and shrugged. 

“Kids have too much energy,” 
Tim said. 



T hat night Pete and Grace lay 
together on the double mat- 
tress, respirators on, whispering. 
Around them the children slept 
quietly. 

“Did those filters come from 
dead people, Pete?” 

“Yes. 1 buried the people, 
too. Other men are doing the 
same thing. There are no rats, 
dogs or birds — I guess we’ll have 
to bury them all eventually.” 

“Do you suppose we can see 
another family some time?” 

“I guess so. It’s not so bad out 
there any more. I saw a gang 
once, but they never came back 
around here. Area looks too 
burned out, I guess. 1 think there’s 
a family a couple of blocks down 
Division, in the old laundry, but 
I haven’t looked to make sure. A 
lot of people have guns and they’re 
still afraid.” 

“You don’t carry your gun any 
more.” 

Pete rolled over and took her in- 
to his arms. “Honey, I hate that 
gun. I’ll never use it again, God 
willing. 1 hope you know that. I’m 
not a killer. If it hadn’t been for 
you and the kids, I don’t think I 
ever would have pulled a trigger — 
I’d just have run away. It was 
worse than a war, honey, a lot 
worse. Nobody even hated any- 
one — there just wasn’t enough of 
everything to go around. I had to 
have it for you; he had to have it 
for his wife and kids. It was as 
simple as that. 1 heard guys say- 
ing, 'Christ forgive me — ’ as they 
pulled the trigger.” 

“If only they could have talked 
together first.” 

Pete shook his head. “Noth- 



50 



GALAXY 




ing to talk about. All anybody 
could have done would have been 
to draw straws. But nobody was 
drawing straws just for himself. 
You don’t come back home and 
say, ‘Sorry, honey — sorry, kids, 
we have to make room for some- 
body else to live.’ There just plain 
wasn’t enough to go around. You 
remember. The time the filters 
ran out and the treatment didn’t 
work any more — when that orange 
stuff clogged them all up. That 
was the worst part. Nobody was 
fighting over food then — it was 
filters. Oh, God.” 

Grace held him while he made 
little noises and lay looking up at 
the dim orange light. 

“There must be a moon to- 
night,” she whispered. “Oh, how 
I would love to see it again.” 

Pete quieted and slept. Soon 
Grace’s eyes closed, too. 

The plastic covers on the win- 
dows rattled; upstairs the Octo- 
ber wind moaned through the 
black timbers. All through the 
night outside there was a subtle 
stirring and whispering, stirring 
this way and that, dying and re- 
turning, moving around the house 
to this side and that side, steadily 
growing. 

The heat began to leave the 
house with little snaps and pops; 
upstairs a window shade rattled 
and flapped as the cold wind swept 
in across the burned-out rooms. 
All night the murmuring went on; 
there were great sighs as a billow 
of air passed down the whole block 
in a single expiration, the sound 
of a ghost passing through the 
empty streets. Winter had come. 

Pete struggled to wake up. 



There was something . noise — 
“Gracie! I hear someone!” 

Tim woke and sat up, then Mike 
and the toddler. Finally Judy sat 
up, rubbing her goggles out of 
habit. 

Tim said sharply, “Dad — hey, 
look! On the wall!” 

On the wall was a brilliant 
rectangle of light, the size and 
shape of a basement window. It 
glowed yellow-white. Not orange. 
Beyond the windows was blue sky. 

M ACAULEY stood next to two 
small graves in the front yard 
and called out again, “Hey, any- 
one in there? Come on outside!” 

In a moment Pete appeared in 
the doorway, shirtless, carrying a 
gun and wearing a respirator. He 
stood for a second, then slowly 
reached up to loosen his mask. He 
let it fall to the ground and drop- 
ped the gun beside it. 

Macauley waved at the sky. 
“It’s real. The front got here last 
night and that did it.” 

Pete said, “Mister, I have to 
get my family. 1 wish 1 had a drink 
to offer you.” 

“1 didn’t do it.” Macauley grin- 
ned. He stepped forward and 
handed Pete a card. “Here are 
some instructions — we’re getting 
organized. Come to Lincoln Park 
this afternoon if you can. We’ll be 
talking about food and there’ll be 
some Army doctors if you have 
anyone sick. It’s bad out here, but 
we made it. See you.” 

Macauley went striding off 
down the block. Pete called over 
his shoulder: 

“Gracie, kids! Come on up. It’s 
over.” ★

HEREDITY 

I 

O N THAT epk day when man 
first touched the moon, we — my 
brother Tom and I — lay on the 
floor of our two-room flat over our 
father’s shop in Newark, drink- 
ing in the drama of it through our 
old black-and-white TV. 

One small step for man, one 
giant leap for mankind . 

Those electric words of Arm- 
strong’s still shiver in my memory. 
The worn brown carpet smelled of 
our father’s strong Turkish to- 
bacco and our mother’s lavender 
body powder and those stale 
scents are still mingled in my mind 
with the unforgettable throb of 
wild pride that caught my throat 
when man’s searching boot first 
found the moon. 

“Now they’ve got themselves the 
gelt.” Tom’s raw envy nearly 
spoiled the moment for me. “And 
here 1 am, still stuck in Hotzen- 
plotz!” 

The history of the moon chil- 
dren begins with that instant, 
even though they would not even be 
born for many years. 1 wish chance 
had selected a better historian, 
because their story seems too big 
for me to tell. Looking at the task, 
1 think of Swift’s Gulliver. 

Gulliver has always been my 
favorite literary character. I 
never understood all the higher 



criticism of Swift as a theologi- 
cal satirist, but 1 always felt close 
to Gulliver — a plain, ordinary 
human being, reasonable and 
honest, involved through no fault, 
of his own in affairs that were too 
much for him. 

The lives of the moon children 
are a vaster adventure than any- 
thing Swift invented for Gulliver, 
and telling it well calls for more 
style and wit than I possess. Per- 
haps my brother Tom should have 
been the narrator. He was in- 
volved as deeply as 1 and he had 
humor and imagination. I recall 
our father saying that he was the 
natural poet of the family and I 
was only the schlemiel. 

“Please, Gamal!” Mother came 
plaintively to my defense. 
“You’re hurting Kim and teach- 
ing Tom too many of your own 
slick tricks. Better a schlemiel 
than a gonif." 

“Your own son a thief already? 
Hoo-ha!” 

He gave her a black-eyed blink 
of wounded innocence and told a 
Yiddish joke that I didn’t under- 
stand, though Tom snickered 
knowingly. Mother stared back 
indignantly and suddenly de- 
cided to send me down to the deli- 
catessen to buy boiled ham hocks 
for our dinner. Father snarled bit- 
terly at that, but the ham hocks 
were cheap. 

In spite of such bickering Tom 
knew how to make up with me. We 



54 



GALAXY 




were generally friends. After the 
moon landing, when we knew the 
Eagle was safe in space again, I re- 
member how we stood up and 
shook hands and resolved to be as- 
tronauts. 

“What chance have you got?” 
With a weary sigh. Mother looked 
up sadly from the potatoes she 
was peeling. “Gamal Hodian’s 
kids?” 

“What’s wrong with Pop?” Tom 
stared at her. “He out-smarts 
everybody. Anyhow, like the TV 
says, things will be different now. 
Kim can be your pet schlemiel if 
he wants, but me. I’m grabbing 
my share of the planets.” 

“Don’t call Kim that — ” 

“Pop does,” Tom reminded her. 
“Me, I don’t care what he is. I’m 
on my way to the moon.” 

“Better finish high school first.” 
“Better help your little yukl 
blow his nose.” Tom smirked at 
me, “I’ll do okay. Pop says I’ll be 
another macher, just as good as 
him.” 

White-lipped, Mother bent over 
her potatoes again. My eyes 
blurred with pity for us both. She 
was a big, raw-boned blonde. She 
must have been a striking girl, 
though her wedding pictures show 
her already worn and fading when 
she married. 

Once she caught Tom and me 
rummaging through a black, 
lavender-scented, lacquer box of 
old photographs and trinkets he 



had found in her dresser. Her pic- 
tures looked lovely to me, but he 
was snickering at her “cow-sized 
tits.” She slapped him and 
snatched the box away, but later 
she let me see her souvenirs and 
told how she had run away from an 
unhappy home in the Arkansas 
hills, hoping to break into show 
business. 

She couldn’t help sobbing when 
she talked about it. She said her 
voice had been too thin and her 
bones too big. She tried the Nash- 
ville Grand Old Opry and tried 
Hollywood and tried New York, 
but her luck never broke. She was a 
waitress in a third-rate bar when 
she met Gamal Hodian. 

H ODIAN must have been an 
alias, but I never knew my fa- 
ther’s original name. He was a 
dark, stocky, evasive man, who 
spoke several languages badly, 
English worst of all. He was secre- 
tive about everything. Mother 
thought he was an Egyptian na- 
tive. Tom believed he was Jewish. 
I once heard a business associate 
call him “a sneaking Armenian 
thief.” He used to say himself that 
he had no country. His passport 
was Turkish, but probably 
forged. 

He had wanted to name my 
brother Tamar and me Kemal, but 
Mother made him call us Tom 
and Kim. The Hodian name must 
have been assumed when he be-

gan visiting the United States, 
soon after World War II and long 
before he met my mother. He 
called himself an importer and we 
always lived in some low-rent sec- 
tion, over or behind a grimy little 
shop that was sparsely stocked 
with the cheap perfumes and tarn- 
ished brassware and tattered 
scraps of carpet that he had im- 
ported. 

There were other imports, 1 
think, that I never learned much 
about. Strange customers always 
made him nervous and he was 
away most of the time on what 
Mother called buying trips. One 
of those lasted nearly three years. 
Mother told us he was ill in An- 
kara, but Tom snorted that he was 
somewhere in jail. 

The year I entered high school he 
disappeared. He had always hat- 
ed Sicilians and Mother insisted 
that the Mafia had murdered him. 
Long after, however, I found 
among her things a little packet of 
scented letters mailed in Mar- 
seilles to “M. Hobereau” at a 
Staten Island post office box. In 
a very feminine French hand they 
begged him to come back to his 
cherie and their petit enfant. Per- 
haps he went. 

Though he had never been a 
bountiful provider, times grew 
even harder for us then. Mother 
closed out the shop and began to 
look for a job. Some of my fa- 
ther’s old friends put her on an un- 



certain dole, I think to keep her 
from telling what she knew about 
them. 

Once one of them took me into a 
bar to talk about my future. A 
dark, watchful, jumpy little man 
who stank of garlic and cheap 
wine, he whispered questions and 
blinked in unbelief at all I didn’t 
know about my father’s connec- 
tions. Mother must have been beg- 
ging him to offer me some kind of 
job, but finally. he stalked out in- 
dignantly and left me to pay for 
the drinks. 

Mother stumbled or jumped in 
front of a truck the spring I fin- 
ished high school. Two fat sisters 
and a Baptist preacher-brother 
came from Little Rock for the fu- 
neral. I had cleared the empty gin 
bottles out of the flat and I didn’t 
tell them about the needle marks 
the coroner had found on her 
arms. 

Tom was already on his way to- 
ward the moon by then. Older 
than I, stronger and darker and 
smarter, more like our father, he 
always had a keener eye for the 
main chance. He weeded the Yid- 
dish expressions out of his speech 
and earned a college scholarship 
to major in space science. 

I did worse. With no head for 
math, I won no scholarships. 
Mother’s insurance came to six 
thousand dollars when all the bills 
were paid. I went to Las Vegas 
with my share, to try my luck. It 



56 



GALAXY 




was bad. The money lasted three 
nights. 

M y actual education began 
with that disaster. Sometimes i 
was hungry. The police picked me 
up two or three times before I 
learned I hadn’t inherited my fa- 
ther’s talents. I tended bar and 
drove taxis and sold used cars. I 
bought a guitar and tried crooning 
folk ballads, but my voice turned 
out no better than my mother’s. I 
wrote songs nobody sang and a 
novel nobody would print. I was a 
disk jockey and a TV reporter 
and even a political campaign 
manager — for a candidate who 
lost. 

Tom, year by year, moved closer 
to our old dream. He went from 
college into the Space Force and 
finally into COSMOS — the 

acronym stood for Civilian 
Organization of Man in Outer 
Space. Its idealistic aim was to ex- 
plore space in peace for the com- 
mon good. Tom used to poke fun 
at the high-minded slogan, “free 
worlds for free men,” but he lifted 
off for the new training base on 
the moon with the first class of 
COSMOS cadets. He had al- 
ready changed his name to Thomas 
Hood. 

He-wangled an assignment to a 
satellite survey team. The COS- 
MOS space engineers were then 
developing the seeker-type sur- 
vey rocket, which carried a dozen 



tons of sophisticated hardware 
designed to chart and analyze the 
surface of an airless world from 
low orbital flight. The seeker sur- 
vey was planned to cover a hun- 
dred satellites and large aster- 
oids, beginning with test flights 
around Earth’s moon. 

“Not that I think we’ll find any- 
thing.” Tom grinned. “But the 
moon’s a cozy little mission, close 
to home and Robin Hudson.” 

Robin was the jet-set daughter 
of Howard Hudson, a hotel ty- 
coon he had managed to meet. 
With her sullen charm and her fa- 
ther’s fortune she was more excit- 
ing to Tom than the moon was 
now, since the spacemen were 
passing it by. 

He took me to one of her fa- 
ther’s floating resorts, the An- 
tilles Hudson, for a weekend with 
the other members of his three- 
man survey team. Seeker One was 
already in orbit around the moon 
and Tom’s Seeker Two crewmen 
were waiting for the space engi- 
neers to analyze the data tapes. 

The invitation surprised me. An- 
noyed when I wouldn’t change my 
own name to match his, he had be- 
gun treating me like a beggar 
relation. Yet I was glad enough to 
go — the failure of that political 
adventure had left me without 
job or plans. 

We found his teammates on a 
bright sundeck, high above the 
milky glitter of the hot Carib- 



themoonchildren 



57 




bean. They were quarreling about 
the real aims of the seeker survey. 

“Security!” Erik Thorsen was a 
huge, red-haired Viking. He had 
lately shed his major’s rank in the 
United States Space Force — COS- 
MOS personnel had to be civil- 
ians — but he still wore his military 
bearing like a uniform. 

“Military security.” He banged 
the table with his empty beer stein. 
“That’s all I’m looking for.” 

“Then you’ll never find it,” Yuri 
Marko answered. “All you’ll find 
is your own destruction. I’m 
searching for something else — ” 

H e paused when he saw us. 

Tom introduced me. Marko 
was a tall man, owlish behind his 
black-rimmed glasses, intensely 
serious. He seated us courteous- 
ly and turned doggedly back to 
his attack. 

“We’re looking for life,” he told 
Thorsen. “Nothing else is worth 
the cost — ” 

“God save us from alien life.” 
Thorsen waved his stein like a 
club. “We’ve got the people boom 
right here without looking for 
trouble on other planets.” 

“Trouble?” Marko’s dark anx- 
ious eyes appealed to Tom and 
me. “Our space neighbors have 
never harmed us yet. I don’t think 
they will. I hope to find higher life 
than we are. Something with mind 
enough to cross the space between 
the stars.” 



Thorsen muttered skeptically. 
“That’s our real goal.” Marko 
bent intently toward him. “1 be- 
lieve life can spring up on the 
worlds of any star. The older 
forms should be far ahead of us. If 
interstellar travel is actually 
possible, space explorers should 
have touched our worlds. We 
should find their footprints.” 

“On the moon?” 

Marko nodded. 

“The airless worlds are the place 
to look. Wind and water wipe out 
everything. But the signs of a land- 
ing on the moon — a broken tool or 
an empty fuel container or even a 
literal footprint — might last a 
good many million years.” 

“1 pray to God we never meet 
another creature!” 

Thorsen lurched to his feet and 
stalked away. Tom followed to 
soothe him. I was left with Yuri 
Marko. His reserved, school-mas- 
terish manner put me off at first, 
but we soon found things in com- 
mon. 

His parents, like my father, had 
been immigrants — they were 
Ukraninian defectors from the 
First Soviet. A political idealist, 
he had even voted for my unlucky 
United World candidate. I caught 
his contagious interest in the 
seeker project. 

The biofprms of Mercury and 
Venus and Jupiter were still at 
that time mostly inference and 
mystery. Nobody had ever

GALAXY 




jeriously proposed that these near 
neighbors in space might be ad- 
vanced beyond us. Marko’s hopes 
took hold of my imagination, 
j “Just suppose we’re not alone.” 
His dry Slavic accents excited 
[ne with a sense of the dimensions 
kf the universe I had never felt be- 
'ore. “Imagine other minds — and 
Treater ones. Picture an intelli- 
rent society spread across the 
itars — a society in which our 
Earth would be a nameless vil- 
age. Perhaps you can’t quite vis- 
lalize our fellow creatures out in 
pace, but at least the effort gives 
mu a truer image of yourself.” 

! On our last night together at the 
ntilles Hudson, Robin gave a 
arty for us in her surfside apart- 
lent. The lights were dimmed, so 
lat we could watch the waves ex- 
loding into white phosphores- 
ence against the glass seawall, 
ler father was there, the ice-eyed 
loney king, and at last 1 guessed 
'hy Tom had invited me. 

Howard Hudson, with the world 
1 his web of floating hotels, had 
irned acquiring eyes toward 
3ace. The Orbital Hudson and 
le Crater Hudson were soon to 
pen. What he wanted from us 
as a quick secret report on any- 
ling of commercial promise the 
irvey might uncover. The news 
as to come from Tom through 
e, coded into some harmless 
-rsonal message. 

Erik Thorsen flushed with anger 

He moon children 



when he understood what was up. 
He smashed his champagne glass 
against the glowing seawall and 
threatened to expose the plot. 
Tom silkily suggested that Thor- 
sen had secret military ties to the 
Space Force that COSMOS 
wouldn’t like. Thorsen turned pale 
and agreed to say nothing. 

1 saw Marko’s hurt contempt 
for me. 

“Listen,” 1 begged him. “Tom’s 
taking too much for granted. He 
never mentioned a word of this to 
me. I won’t touch it. Believe me.” 

1 don’t think he did. 

That incident brought the party 
to an awkward end. Tom told me 
curtly that I was no longer his 
guest. But as things turned out, 1 
remained at the resort after his 
team was gone. Marooned there, 
without money to pay my unex- 
pected bill, I went to the publicity 
office and talked my way into a 
copy-writing job. 

Surveying the moon, as things 
turned out, was not the cozy little 
mission Tom had anticipated. 
Seeker One crashed behind the 
moon, with no survivors to report 
what had gone wrong. Tom and his 
team were called out to continue 
the moon survey with Seeker 
Two. 

M 

M y brother was not alone in 
his surprise at what the seek- 



59 




ers found. The moon had kept her 
secret well. The early astronauts 
and cosmonauts had seen too 
many empty craters of every size 
to expect much else. Their succes- 
sors went on — as soon as they 
could — to look for more exciting 
worlds. 

The moon was quite dead, but 
the planets were already promis- 
ing the menace and allure of un- 
known life. When the robot probes 
on Mars began to scrape up 
samples for analysis their tele- 
metry indicated complex organic 
molecules. The first men to touch 
that tawny dust caught a torment- 
ing illness that kept them in quar- 
antine at the COSMOS base on 
Phobos till they died. 

The blinding clouds of Venus 
veiled the same sort of ambiguous 
mystery. Unmanned probes 
brought back simple organisms 
of microscopic beta-life from the 
highest levels of her atmosphere, 
but no vehicle, manned or not, 
ever returned from the unseen 
surface beneath. 

The first men to station them- 
selves in orbit around her found 
new riddles rather than answers 
to old ones. They saw dark dots 
above the clouds — larger crea- 
tures, they suspected, in an eco- 
logical pyramid based on the beta- 
life. They described a sudden 
color change that stained the blank 
planet with swirls of brown and yel- 
low. They were reporting an un- 



explained power loss when their 
signals faded out. j 

One lone member of the first 
three-man team came back from 
Mercury. He had seen nothin 
alive and he lived through his yea 
at the quarantine station on th 
moon, but he brought pictures of 
queer crater-ringed, iron-walle 
tunnel from which his compan 
ions had never returned. 

Though no probe had yet com 
back from tjie atmosphere of Ju 
piter, a COSMOS expeditio 
had touched the four large satel 
lites. The first craft to visit lo 
nearest the planet, reported tha 
its take off had been followed by 
narrow beam of intermitte 
radiation, as if something on th 
planet were observing it with r 
dar. 

Against that background 
ominous uncertainty the crash 
Seeker One shocked the world. Th 
first response was a jittery fe 
that something unfriendly ha 
established itself on the back 
the moon. Howard Hudson ma 
the most of that brief panic. 

I was still working in the A 
tilles Hudson, and what I saw w 
a business education. Public a 
nouncements of the crash were d 
layed for several hours, first by t 
fuddled COSMOS bureaucra 
on the moon and later by offici 
censors on Earth, while Hudso 
private spy system coined mon 
for him.

GALAX 



News of the crash came in on 
our astrofac circuit, disguised as 
a weather observation from the 
Orbital Hudson. It was decoded 
by a file clerk in our office, who 
couldn’t help talking when space 
issues dived on the stock market. 

Hudson had his brokers sell 
space industries short. Next day, 
when the story broke, he used the 
publicity office to spread a wild 
rumor. The creatures of Venus 
had learned about space from the 
hardware raining out of their 
clouds. Now they were building a 
military base on the moon to stop 
our astronauts from polluting 
their air. 

The news that COSMOS was 
now transmitting from the moon 
gave that rumor more support 
than it deserved. The bottom fell 
out of the market and Hudson’s 
brokers picked up space stocks for 
peanuts. Office gossip had it that 
he cleared three billion in three 
days. 

C OSMOS tried to cool the ru- 
mors with a bulletin phrased in 
wooden officialese. Responsible 
space authorities had found no 
evidence of hostile action against 
the lost seeker from any source 
whatever. Neither the observers 
on the orbital moon platform or 
the crew of the seeker itself had 
feported anything unusual be- 
fore the crash occurred. Salvage 
orews already at the site could find 

The MOON CHILDREN 



no indication of attack or sabo- 
tage. Presumably, instrumental 
malfunction had allowed the sur- 
vey craft to drift out of its very low 
orbit and graze a lunar peak. The 
media would be instantly alert- 
ed to any new developments, but 
there was no reason whatever for 
public apprehension. 

Seeker Two was standing ready 
to resume routine flights as soon 
as her crew reached the moon, the 
bulletin concluded. Thus far the 
survey had made no newsworthy 
discoveries. 

None, in fact, were actually ex- 
pected, because the moon was 
utterly dead. The test flights, how- 
ever, had already established the 
value of the seeker vehicles for 
mapping the resources of other 
airless worlds. 

Five minutes after that stuffy 
statement came over the transfac 
net our office was buzzing with 
livelier news from the moon. It 
came by laser beam from the man- 
ager of the new Crater Hudson. 
After our laserman had relayed 
the message to Hudson’s office, 
he replayed his tape for us. 

“. Listen, Mr. Hudson. Don’t 
swallow the COSMOS line. 
They’re covering up something. 1 
don’t know what — maybe just the 
fact that this thing shows them up 
for idiots. But they’re sitting on 
something I think you ought to 
know. 

“It’s true that Seeker One dived 

61 




ference. Her first transmissions 
were completely routine. 

“All systems go. No anomalies 
noted.” 

However, as she neared that 
point where Seeker One had fired 
her retro-rockets, the tvatchers on 
[the platform made a terse report 
to the COSMOS center at Arm- 
I strong Point. 

“Platform to Moon Control! 
We’ve got something. A surface 
glow, apparently touched off by 
[approach of Seeker Two. A 
luminous streak, maybe twenty 
kilometers long. Like an arrow- 
head. Brighter toward the point. 
Location estimated six hundred 
kilometers from south lunar 
pole.” 

Moon Control replied with an 
urgent query to Seeker Two. What 
was she observing? 

“Lunar surface lighting up under 
us.” Marko’s taped voice sounds 
crisp and cool. “Bright rays 
spreading north from a small 
crater just ahead, which looks like 
an impact point. We’ve got 
spectrometers running on the 
rays. They appear to be fluores- 
cent material scattered north from 
that crater. Spectral analysis not 
yet complete.” 

“Keep in orbit.” Moon Control 
seems more alarmed than Marko 
is. “Monitor everything but don’t 
leave your flight pattern — ” 

“Seeker Two to Moon Control.” 
l^arko’s voice is quicker on the 

themoon children 



tape, but still oddly calm. “Re- 
porting visual contact with un- 
charted installation ahead. Some- 
thing standing on that impact 
point. Position estimated sixty- 
nine degrees south latitude, on cir- 
cumpolar survey track eighty- 
eight. A shining tower — ” 

Marko’s voice fades out. 
“Seeker Two! Seeker Two! 
Moon Control shouts. “Keep talk- 
ing. Tell us everything.” 

“A vast installation!’’ Even 
Marko sounds breathless now. “I 
-can’t imagine why it wasn’t seen 
before. The tower dome stands 
miles above our flight path. Dead 
ahead. It looks like some sort of 
beacon. Changing color. Red, yel- 
low, orange. It’s running through 
the spectrum — ” 

“Platform to Seeker.” A sharper 
voice cuts in. “We’re tracking you 
by telescope. We see the surface 
phenomenon — bright streaks con- 
verging toward the impact crater 
now just ahead of you. But we see 
no tower. No obstruction. Your 
flight path looks clear.” 

For long seconds the tape re- 
cords no voice. 

“Seeker Two.” Moon Control is 
hoarse with tension. “Seeker Two. 
Seeker Two!” 

“Seeker T wo to Moon Control.” 
Marko’s voice comes back at last, 
pitched lower, relieved. “We’ve 
made voice contact and identified 
the installation ahead. It’s the 
base of a transgalactic mission 

63 




seeking peaceful interaction with 
mankind. We’re following in- 
structions to land at the base on 
our next orbital pass.” 

“Don’t do that!” Moon Control 
sounds almost frantic. “Climb 
clear of apparent obstruc- 
tion — don’t try to land! The plat- 
form sees no tower. We think 
you’re caught in some kind of trap. 
Remember Seeker One. Don’t 
touch your retrorockets.” 

The tape rustles with solar static, 
but there is no reply. 

“Moon Control to Seeker 
Two!” The voice rises raggedly. 
“Don’t try to land. Repeat: don’t 
try to land. Break off contact with 
surface point. Change flight pat- 
tern to avoid vicinity of survey 
curve eighty-eight. Acknowledge 
and stand by.” 

The tape runs on, but Seeker 
Two does not acknowledge. 

Ill 

M oon control at the mo- 
ment was Sherman Parkin- 
son. Like Erik Thorsen, he had 
recently resigned a military com- 
mission to make himself eligible 
for the civilian space organization. 
To judge him by his own standards, 
he was no doubt a brave and well- 
trained officer, loyal to the an- 
cient traditions of the United 
States Marine Corps if not to the 
COSMOS ideal of a united man- 
kind. 



I saw him back on Earth two or; 
three years later, confined to the 
alcoholics ward of a veterans hos- 
pital. The events on the moon hac 
evidently been too much for him 
Habit-driven as a dinosaur, he wai 
not prepared to cope with any 
thing so far beyond his owi 
experience. 

But the drinking came later. Hi 
seems to have remained sobe 
during that crisis. The panel o 
special investigators saw fit, ii 
fact, to commend him for stead 
fast devotion to duty. 

He was keen enough to see tha 
Seeker Two was flying into som 
kind of trap, but he seems to hav 
been taken in by Hudson’s rumo 
of attackers from Venus. Whei 
Marko ignored his orders. Park 
inson called Skygate to ask fo 
military support. 

Space was international 
Skygate reminded him. As th< 
COSMOS administrator on thi 
moon, he was in command, but h< 
was not to make any use of mili 
tary force without the explici 
unanimous prior consent of th 
COSMOS directorate on Earth. 

Angered, Parkinson issued nev 
orders for Seeker Two to leave th 
survey pattern and return at one 
to Armstrong Point. Even unde 
the kiddies’ picnic rules o 
COSMOS, he pointed out, Mark 
and his men could be taken o 
flight status for failure to obey d 
rect orders, fined for misuse ( 



64 



GALAX 



COSMOS property and im- 
prisoned up to ten years for con- 
duct endangering public safety. 
When such threats evoked no 
answer, Parkinson tried gravel- 
voiced appeals. Hadn’t the team 
heard the platform’s report that 
the transgalactic base didn’t ex- 
ist? Didn’t they know the hazards 
of contact with alien biocosms? 
Couldn’t they recall their obliga- 
tions to COSMOS and mankind? 

Seeker Two kept on its silent 
path. When it went behind the 
moon from the platform, cutting 
off laser contact, Sherman Park- 
inson turned his attention to the 
platform itself, which still had 
that luminous streak in yiew. It was 
slowly fading behind the seeker, 
the platform reported. The ray- 
like splash of scattered material 
was now barely visible, but the cir- 
cle of the impact crater was still 
distinct. 

The platform picked the seeker 
up when she came back across the 
moon’s north pole, reporting that 
she had changed course just enough 
to follow the rotating moon, so 
that she was returning along sur- 
vey curve eighty-eight toward that 
dying gleam. 

Parkinson bombarded her with 
desperate questions. What kind of 
creatures manned that trans- 
galactic base? How had they con- 
cealed it? What language had they 
used for voice contact? What data 
had the sensors recorded? 



Seeker Two flew on with no 
reply. 

The platform tracked her back 
down survey curve eighty-eight. 
Soon after she crossed the moon’s 
equator, that arrow-shaped im- 
pact-splash blazed out again ahead. 
Presently her retro-rockets fired, 
lifting her on a long arc that 
slanted back toward the glowing 
crater. 

The watchers on the platform 
followed the flare of her jets, 
which contracted to an in- 
candescent point as she came 
down. Their instruments re- 
corded an anomalous surge of hard 
radiation which peaked at the in- 
stant her jets went out. 

At that point the platform lost 
contact, as its own orbital motion 
carried it behind the moon, out of 
laser range. Its observers re- 
ported the rayed crater still glow- 
ing on the moon’s horizon as long 
as they could see it. 

Sherman Parkinson called 
Skygate to beg for help. Told again 
that COSMOS couldn’t break its 
code of peace in space without 
proof of actual attack, he said pro- 
fanely that he would get the proof. 
Ignoring all protests, he took off 
in an unarmed skippercraft for 
the site of the crash. 

T he sun was rising there when he 
arrived. Its harsh glare washed 
out any trace of that dying glow. 
The impact crater and its north- 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



65 




ward rays now looked black, his 
taped report states, as if a ship- 
load of ink had struck and 
splashed. The skipper’s counters 
detected no anomalous radiation 
and nothing revealed any sign of 
a transgalactic base. 

There was only Seeker Two, 
standing tilted among the boulders 
on the steep north crater rim. She 
showed neither damage from her 
reckless landing nor any trace of 
life. Parkinson dropped cautious- 
ly a little farther from the crater 
lip and made a discovery that ex- 
hausted his Marine vocabulary. 

As he hoarsely reported to the 
moon platform, three sets of foot- 
prints left Seeker Two. They wan- 
dered north among the boulders for 
a distance of several hundred 
meters. Finally they returned. It 
was those returning prints that set 
off his most explosive diction. 
Magnet-cleated flight boots had 
made the outgoing prints, but 
three sets of bare feet returned. 

“Relay this to Skygate.” Park- 
inson paused as if to clear his head 
and clean up his language. “We’ve 
found Seeker Two — and some- 
thing the medics have to explain. 
Prints in the dust show that all 
three crew members went for a 
barefoot walk and somehow got 
back aboard.” 

“Better check your eyes and 
look again,” the platform advised 
him. “Men don’t go barefoot on 
the moon. Not far anyhow. You’ll 



have to collect some pretty solid 
evidence, sir, or you won’t last 
long as Moon Control.” 

Parkinson looked again. He 
moved the skipper twice to photo- 
graph the prints before he sealed 
his own moonsuit and went out 
with a spaceman to inspect the 
seeker. 

The air lock had been sealed 
again. Hammered signals brought 
no response. Parkinson had to 
knock out an emergency access 
plate to cycle the lock and get 
aboard. Marko and Hood and 
Thorsen lay sprawled on the deck 
where they must have collapsed 
when they got back from their un- 
explained^excursion into the 
moon’s deadly night. 

The three men wore no boots, 
gloves or helmets. Their faces 
were stained with dried blood, 
which must have boiled out of their 
lungs into the vacuum of space. 
Parkinson felt certain at first that 
they were dead. 

The damage to their bodies was 
far less severe, however, th.an 
might have been expected. 
Savagely cold as that dust must 
have been, their feet were not 
frozen. The rigor of death had not 
set in. On a second examination, 
after he had increased the oxy- 
helium pressure, Parkinson de- 
cided that they were still breath- 
ing. 

“1 think they were out collecting 
this black dust,” he reported to the 



66 



GALAXY 




platform. “The stuff that colors 
the crater dark. A sort of coarse 
grit, actually. Sprayed all around 
the crater. But mostly north, as if 
scattered by an impact from the 
south. 

“Queer stuff.” Parkinson’s voice 
was hoarse and breathless. “The 
particles are sharp-edged, have a 
bright black shine and they all look 
identical. Like nothing else I ever 
saw. These men were after this 
queer grit. Their boots are stuffed 
with it. Their tool pockets are full 
of it. Hodian had it crammed in 
his mouth.” 

Relayed from the platform to 
Armstrong Point and from there 
down to Skygate, Parkinson’s re- 
ports elicited every shade of amuse- 
ment and unbelief. He was 
variously advised to change his 
brand of whiskey, to get the fin- 
gerprints of the little green men 
and to photograph everything be- 
fore he touched it. 

“I nearly wish we had found 
those invaders from Venus,” he 
told the spacemen on the seeker 
with him. “We know what to do 
with enemies we can reach.” 

S IFTING now through the COS- 
MOS bulletins and the leaked 
reports from Hudson’s spies, I 
can almost watch the inter- 
rogation of the seeker crew there in 
the hospital under Armstrong 
Point. Details emerge from the 
raspy tapes. The dull drone of the 



fans. The chemical sting of the air. 
The narrow tunnel room, drill- 
scarred moon rock glistening with 
glassy sealant. The three men, 
cocoons in white gauze, reeking of 
sterifoam, surrounded by medics 
and guards. Parkinson barking 
questions at them, growing red- 
der and louder with every answer 
he can’t accept. 

Yuri Marko is questioned first. 

“ — a secret base.” The sur- 
viving tape begins in midsentence. 
Marko’s throat is raw and swollen 
from his unbelievable exposure 
to the lunar night. His scratchy 
voice is hard to make out. “But the 
beings there aren’t from Venus, sir. 
They aren’t from any planet of our 
sun.” 

Parkinson sounds grittily 
skeptical. “How do you know?” 

“1 saw the base.” Marko 
answers. “1 talked to its people. 
They belong to a high culture that 
spreads far through the galaxy. 
They’ve been stationed on the 
moon a long time to watch our 
evolution. They’re delighted that 
we’ve come far enough to qualify 
for contact.” 

“Hunh!” 

“Sir, think of what it means!” 
Marko’s awed elation comes 
clearly through his hoarseness 
and pain. “They want to share their 
tremendous civilization with us. 
Our lives will never be the 
same — ” 

“There is no base,” Parkinson 

67 



themoon children 




cuts in. “The platform was watch- 
ing the spot. I’ve just been out 
there. There’s nothing but some 
odd black grit scattered around in 
the impact crater. If you saw any- 
thing it must have been some sort 
of space mirage.” 

For a few seconds the tape runs 
silently. 

“Sir, I know what’s real,’’ 
Marko’s faint whisper insists at 
last. “I’ve tried drugs. I’ve had 
illusions. They feel different. No 
matter what anybody saw, that 
base is real.” 

“Tell about it.” 

“It’s a structure.” Marko pauses 
as if to think. “But everything 
about it reflects an unknown cul- 
ture. The design, the materials, the 
unbelievable dimensions. Our 
language doesn’t fit, but I’ll try to 
give you my impression. Imagine 
a tight cluster of roujid white 
columns, each a different height. 
The six lower columns are capped 
with platforms arranged in a ris- 
ing spiral around the central 
tower. It’s tain Its onion-shaped 
dome must have been ten kilo- 
meters above our orbit. That dome 
changes color like a beacon — I 
think the platforms are landing 
stages under it. Some were empty, 
but I saw great globe-shaped ships 
on two of them.” Marko raises his 
voice. “Sir, does that sound like a 
dream?” 

“It ain’t there now,” Parkinson 
sneers. “You say you were in voice 

68 



contact with — whatever you 
thought you saw. What language 
did you use?” 

“Why — ” Marko pauses as if 
astonished by his own recollec- 
tion. “Ukrainian! The voice I 
heard wasn’t human. It was a 
modulated electronic hum, 
like — like a computer simulating 
speech. I remember wondering 
if it didn’t come through some kind 
of translating device. But it 
spoke the Ukrainian peasant 
dialect my parents used at home. 
That is remarkable!” 

“Remarkable ain’t the word. 
What happened after you 
landed?” 

The tape whirs quietly. 

“I can’t recall,” Marko mutters 
at last. “That buzzing voice 
coached us in. I remember firing 
the retros. 1 remember watching 
the lowest stage of the tower, 
where I thought we were going to 
land. I remember thinking we 
were coming in too low to make it. 
Then it all fades out.” 

“Because it wasn’t there.” 

E rik TFIORSEN is next on the 
tape. Parkinson greets him 
heartily as “Major,” as if expect- 
ing something saner from a fellow 
soldier, and asks him to tell in his 
own words what happened to 
Seeker Two. 

“Yes, sir. Colonel Parkinson.” 
Thorsen crispily returns the mili- 
tary courtesy. “We were all three 



GALAXY 




on duty, sir. Alert for whatever 
got Seeker One. We were all ob- 
serving that luminous patch on the 
surface ahead. We all saw’ some- 
thing beyond it at the same time, 
sir. What 1 saw was a fort.” 
“Venusian?” 

“I can’t say, sir. It was 
enormous. Round like a turret. 
Buried in the moon. Camouflaged 
with a rocky ridge that looked like 
a crater rim. It rose as we got 
closer. Bristling with missiles like 
1 never saw before.” 

“Did it fire on you?” 

“No, sir. Hood was working our 
radio and laser gear. He picked up 
a voice commanding us to land 
beside the fort. That voice — ” 
Thorsen hesitated. “It spoke 
Norwegian, sir. My own good 
mother’s Riksmaal, that I learned 
at home in Stavanger.” 

“Norwegian?” Parkinson’s 
startled voice has lost its warm 
tone of military fellowship. “Is 
little Norway building forts in 
space?” 

“That’s all I know, sir.” Thorsen 
sounds angry. “I don’t remember 
landing.” 

“Listen, Colonel.” My brother’s 
voice comes on the tape, husky 
from exposure but still shrewdly 
fluent. “Don’t let ’em put you on. I 
saw what they did — and it was 
neither a galactic base or a Venu- 
sian fort. They’re trying to snow 
you, sir. To hide a million tons of 
gold!” 



“What’s this. Hood? What 
gold?” 

“What I saw was a gold 
meteor,” Tom says. “It hit the 
moon hard enough to burst. But 
the mass of it stands up in the 
middle of that crater. A blazing 
hill of yellow gold. More gold 
scattered all around. Hundred- 
ton nuggets of pure shining 
gold!” 

“Did you hear any voice?” 

“My father’s voice.” Tom 
pauses, as if struck with awe. “My 
own father’s! He disappeared on 
Earth a dozen years ago. We gave 
him up for dead. But here he was, 
calling from his own little survey 
rocket — speaking broken English 
with a funny Turko-Yiddish ac- 
cent, like he did when I was a kid. 
He said he was all alone. He’d 
located that gold with electronic

what we did.” Tom’s voice turns 
sharp. “And that’s why these men 
are lying — to defraud my poor old 
father of that gold claim!” 

“1 saw no gold,” Parkinson 
grates. “Let’s go over all this 
again.”

and calls in the engineers who had 
been at work on samples of that 
black grit. Their answers don’t im- 
prove his temper. 

The grit is impure earbon in 
crystal form, the engineers re- 
port. Most of the crystals have 
been damaged by impact or 
eroded by long exposure to micro- 
meteors, but apparently they had 
all once been perfect tetrahedrons, 
crystals of something new to 
science. 

The intact samples measure 
nearly eight millimeters on edge. 
They are slightly radioactive and 
strongly magnetic. Besides the 
carbon content, chemical analy- 
sis shows six percent silicon, three 
percent gold, and nearly two per- 
cent thorium, with traces of lead 
and a few other elements. One 
chemist suggests that the erystals 
are an unknown allotrope of nat- 
ural carbon. 

“Hogwash,” an engineer objects. 
“They’re too much alike. Original- 
ly, they seem to have been identi- 
cal in every feature, down to our 
limits of measurement. Nothing 
natural is quite that perfect. 1 say 
they’re manufactured.” 

“Who made them?” Parkinson’s 
voiee demands. “What for?” 

The tapes run on, revealing 
Parkinson’s blundering efforts 
to force an answer to that ques- 
tion. When Seeker Two has been 
inspected for possible damage 
and cheeked out to another team. 



he sends her baek into orbit to re- 
sume her interrupted survey 
flight. 

Observers eye her from the 
moon platform, as she returns 
along her charted path to the im- 
paet crater. Engineers in skipper 
craft watch from posts near the 
crater, prepared to photograph 
and measure anything that brings 
her down again. 

But nothing happens. The seeker 
skims low over the crater, observ- 
ing no trarisgalactic base, no space 
fort, no golden meteor. The plat- 
form watchers see no surfaee 
glow. The engineers discover noth- 
ing to photograph or measure. 

The voices of Marko and Thor- 
sen and my brother sound stronger 
on the tapes when Parkinson ques- 
tions them again, but they refuse 
to reconcile their contradictory 
stories. Each remains stubbornly 
eertain of what he thinks he saw, 
and none of them remembers leav- 
ing the seeker to gather that black 
grit. 

Parkinson delays his own sec- 
ond visit to the crater, running 
down blind alleys and filing his in- 
conclusive reports while he waits 
for night to end there. The tapes 
record his landing, timed to meet 
the lunar sunrise. Now he finds 
something new. 

Reporting to the moon plat- 
form, his voice sounds apoplectic. 
Somebody else hasn’t waited for 
the sun. Some time after Seeker

Two passed over the impact site a 
cargo rocket has landed there. 
Magnetic gear has been used to 
sweep up the remaining crystal 
grit. A few bootprints are left in 
the dust, but nothing more reveal- 
ing. 

Parkinson spends half the long 
lunar day at the site, sifting the sur- 
face dust again and drilling a pat- 
tern of test holes around the crater, 
but all he finds is disappointment. 
No buried mascon, no trace of the 
impact object. Nothing to ex- 
plain the crystal grit. Not even a 
broken tool to identify the raiders. 

A t the Antilles Hudson, we had 
^been able to follow events to this 
point through those intercepted re- 
ports, but now our news from the 
moon was cut off. Hudson’s leak- 
ing secrets had spread from the of- 
fice to the hotel guests. An un- 
friendly newsman broadcast the 
story, adding a notion of his own 
that the midnight raid on the 
crater had been planned and led by 
Hudson himself. 

Hudson was away when the 
story broke, but he called home. 
Half a dozen of us were instantly 
fired and nobody shared any more 
tapes from the moon. When Hud- 
son returned — in about the time 
his private spaceplane might have 
required for a quick return flight 
from the moon — he had no com- 
ment on the story or his own 
absence or anything at all. 1 was 

themoonchildren 



still marooned. After all deduc- 
tions for room and food and bar 
chits my discharge pay came to 
twenty-three dollars. 1 lost that at 
the hotel casino, trying to win my 
fare to the mainland. When I went 
back to the employment office, 
an unpleasant clerk suggested 
that 1 might either wash dishes or 
swim for it. 

I said I’d swim. As I walked the 
decks that afternoon, uncertain 
what I could really do, 1 heard a 
news announcement that Robin 
Hudson had arrived to spend the 
weekend with her father. On im- 
pulse, I went up to her suite. 

Surprisingly, the doorbox let me 
in. Robin met me with a moist kiss, 
but her smile went out when she 
learned 1 had no news from Tom. 
And she turned nasty when 1 asked 
her to help me ashore. 

Perhaps 1 lost my own temper. I 
remember calling her a rich bitch. 
She replied that, she was entirely 
happy to be rich and quite content 
that I was a pauper. She added that 
Tom said I had always been a 
sniveling schlemiel and that they 
had both had more than plenty of 
me. 

She did listen sulkily, however, 
when I decided to apologize and 
explain my predicament. For 
Tom’s sake she called the flight 
deck and got me a seat on the Key 
West Jet. 

Back on the mainland I took a 
job writing publicity for Diaf-a- 



71 




Mood, an emotion-conditioner 
designed for home installation. 
We were at war with a rival named 
Joy-Aire. The Joy-Aire people 
had spread rumors that our toners 
were loaded with addictive psy- 
chedelics. My new job was to plant 
counterrumors that the Joy-Aire 
toners had such undesirable side- 
effects as excessive weight gain, 
paralysis and idiocy. 

For some months all I knew of 
the moon story came from the 
colorless COSMOS bulletins. 
The seeker survey was still in prog- 
ress, with no further incident. 
Sherman Parkinson had been re- 
placed at Moon Control by a 
former manager of the Crater 
Hudson. Thomas Hood and his 
fellow crash survivors were well 
enough to be returned from the 
moon to Skygate for further 
examination at the laboratory of 
exobiology there. 

That was all. Filled with news of 
the amazing bioforms seen flying 
about the atmosphere of Jupiter, 
the COSMOS releases said no 
more about the moon. 1 mailed two 
or three letters to Tom at Skygate, 
which he didn’t bother to answer. 

Never quite secure at Dial-a- 
Mood, because 1 lacked what our 
president called “conditional sin- 
cerity,” I kept job applications go- 
ing out. One went to Skygate. The 
reply offered me a speciaf assign- 
nient to write a report on the com- 
mercial use of space science. 



Though the salary wasn’t half what 
Dial-a-Mood paid, 1 accepted with 
delight, because -1 was so anxious 
to pick up the story of the moon 
grit and its queer effects on the 
crew of Seeker T wo. 

IV 

S KYGATE was their birthplace. 

A delicate green had dusted the 
mesa in the wake of rain before I 
arrived, but its mqre common col- 
ors were sandstone red and the 
yellow of wind-drifted dust. The 
spaceplanes came down on an as- 
terite strip fringed with resin- 
scented pihon and juniper. Tiny 
green oases like scattered beads 
were strung along the Albuquer- 
que road, but the wild ridges west 
were as bleak and barren as the 
moon. 

The riddle of that crystal grit 
was still unsolved as far as I could 
learn, but my brother and his team 
had apparently recovered from 
their crash behind the moon. Dis- 
charged from the space hospital, 
they had been allowed to marry. 
All three wives were pregnant. 

My brother’s wife was Robin 
Hudson. The match surprised me. 
Tom had always said no woman 
would get her hooks into him and, 
frankly, I thought Robin might 
have done better. Perhaps she was 
drawn to a sort of wolfish rapacity 
that Tom shared with her own fa- 
ther — and 1 think she liked the no-

tion of becoming Robin Hood. 

Thorsen’s bride was a nurse he 
had met at the hospital on the 
moon. Her parents were Japanese 
and her dainty, sloe-eyed charm 
made an odd contrast to his 
brawny Viking power. Though her 
hesitant English was hard for me 
to understand at first, 1 could feel 
her kindly warmth and her lively 
comic sense. In fact, I fell in love 
with Suzie Thorsen. 

Marko’s wife became almost 
as dear to me. She was Dr. Caro- 
lina Carter, whom he had met at 
a briefing session in space labs 
on his way to the moon. The 
daughter of a black astronaut 
who had died in quarantine on 
Phobos, she had earned her own 
degree in exobiology. She was a 
tall beauty, scholarly and gra- 
cious, but Robin refused to re- 
ceive her. 

She was employed in the labs 
when 1 came to Skygate; she 
worked with cultures of the mi- 
croscopic beta-life the probes had 
brought from the upper air of 
Venus. She was generous with 
facts for my special report. She 
and Marko asked me to their 
home for dinner and it was Marko 
who later offered me a permanent 
job, doing publicity for COSMOS. 

My own faith in any united hu- 
man undertaking was pretty well 
eroded by that time, but I was 
eager to stay at Skygate. I wanted 
more facts than anybody yet knew 

THEMOON CHILDREN 



about those small black crystals. 1 
wanted to know what had brought 
the seekers down and why the con- 
tradictory stories of Marko and 
his men differed so bizarrely from 
the apparent facts. 1 took the job. 

At that point I had seen nothing 
remarkable in the sudden decision 
of all three men to marry. Noth- 
ing had prepared me for the com- 
ing of the moon children, whose 
lives I am trying to describe. 

Somewhat ironically for me, it 
presently developed that my actual 
task in the publicity section was 
not to tell their story, but rather 
to conceal it. The unfolding won- 
ders of their lives soon began to 
draw too much notice. My job, it 
turned out, was to protect them 
from the painful consequences of 
their own surprising strangeness. 

Young Nick Marko’s first sur- 
prising act was his birth. Carolina 
had carried him less than seven 
months, and she was still at work 
in the exobiology lab, running 
amino acid tests on her cultures 
of microscopic bioforms, not an 
hour before he was born. 

A t three pounds and no 
■ ounces, Nick surprised the 
neonatal specialists with his small- 
scale maturity. He breathed eas- 
ily without waiting to be spanked 
and nursed with an uncommon 
eagerness. 

His color was equally surpris- 
ing. Born pink and white, neither 



73 




tomato-vermilion nor with any 
visible touch of his mother’s rich 
pigmentation, he turned nut brown 
in five seconds under the lights on 
his father’s movie camera. Ten 
minutes later, that instant tan was 
gone. 

His pattern of sleep perplexed 
his doctors and frightened his 
parents. For almost a month he 
stayed awake day and night, learn- 
ing to turn himself over and cease- 
lessly exploring every object he 
could reach. On his twenty-eighth 
day, Carolina found him limp and 
cold in his crib. Marko felt no 
pulse and thought he was dead. 

Two physicians agreed. No test 
found any sign of life. Even his 
brain waves had ceased. But Caro- 
lina wouldn’t give him up. She was 
with him all night, tending him as 
zealously as if he had been an- 
other Venusian bioform. At 
eighty-one degrees his falling 
temperature stabilized. Four 
hours later it began to rise. He 
woke in her arms at dawn, bab- 
bling happily and ready to nurse. 

Valkyrie Thorsen was born that 
same night. No robust battle- 
maid, notwithstanding the name 
her father chose, she was even 
tinier than Nick and just as re- 
markably mature. Very fair at 
first, though Suzie Thorsen was 
almost as dark as Carolina, she 
turned briefly golden under the 
lights in the delivery room. 

Oddly alike, Kyrie and Nick 



were equally precocious. They 
shared the same minute per- 
fection, the same shy grace, the 
same happy tempers, the same 
traits of pleasing but nonhuman 
strangeness. Both had the same 
unearthly sort of slim, elfin, large- 
eyed beauty. Both were warmly ; 
and perceptive, yet often un- 
touchably aloof. Both slept only at 
month-long intervals, in the same 
deathlike way. 

They even seemed somehow 
aware of each other before they 
ever met. Carolina discovered 
that one morning when she had 
driven Marko to work at the 
Center, where he was now head of 
the Life Science Section. Baby 
Nick was with her, slung in a 
harness to the car seat. He began 
leaping and crowing as they 
passed Thorsen’s house on the way 
home. 

Carolina had not meant to stop, 
but Nick cried out as she drove 
past the house and began moaning 
so sadly that she turned back 
around the block. He was yelling 
and wriggling again with glee 
when she parked in front of the 
house. 

Inside, Kyrie had been sitting 
against the end of her crib, sol- 
emnly shaking a rattle in time to a 
dissonant blue jazz number that . 
she had learned to request by beat- 
ing out its syncopated rhythm. Be- * 
fore Carolina reached the door ] 
with Nick, she began tossing rat- ' 



74 



GALAXY 




ties and toys out of the crib. When 
Suzie let them in, she pulled her- 
self upright to greet them, squeal- 
ing with delight. 

With eager screams they per- 
suaded the mothers to put them to- 
gether. Seated face to face, one at 
each end of the crib, they fell 
abruptly silent. Wide eyes 
changing slowly from opal-gold to 
midnight black, they studied each 
other for five endless rriinutes. 

Nick pitched suddenly forward 
and got Kyrie’s doll foot into his 
mouth. Carolina swooped to the 
rescue, because Nick was already 
cutting teeth. Kyrie howled, how- 
ever, when she tried to pull Nick 
away. They lay for another hour in 
the crib, prodding and kicking 
and gently biting each other, some- 
times laughing, sometimes so 
grave that Carolina was frighten- 
ed again. 

They clung to each other when 
Carolina wanted to go, until the 
mothers promised that they could 
visit again whenever they pleased. 
Nick seemed to understand. He 
crooned solemnly to Kyrie until 
her somber eyes turned slowly 
golden and then he looked quietly 
up at his mother, ready to leave. 

They let nothing stop those 
promised visits. One morning, 
when it was Kyrie’s turn to call on 
Nick, the mesa was buried under 
an unusual snowfall. Cars were 
stalled, and Suzie refused to go 
out. Kyrie whimpered so piteous- 

the moon children 



ly, however, that Thorsen put 
on his skis and carried her to see 
Nick. 

M y BROTHER’S child was al- 
so surprising, but in more dis- 
tressing ways. Tom was still at 
Skygate, in a new job as assistant 
director of Operation Seeker, but 
Robin had never liked the place. It 
was Sticksgate to her. She was 
abroad most of the time, flitting 
between her father’s floating re- 
sorts with her own set, until her 
unplanned pregnancy alarmed her. 

She begged for an abortion, but 
Tom and her father opposed it. 
Howard Hudson wanted a grand- 
son and Tom may still have been 
responsive to some undiscovered 
influence from the moon grit. She 
might have ignored both of them, 
but when her doctors heard about 
what they called the idiopathic 
births of Nick Marko and Kyrie 
Thorsen, they advised her for her 
own safety to come back to the 
space hospital and bear her child 
under expert care. 

To Robin’s dismay the child 
wasn’t born at seven months. She 
waited fretfully, staying in a suite 
at the Skygate Hudson because 
my brother’s house had no room 
for her nurse and her French maid 
and her hypnotherapist, hating 
what the desert was doing to her 
skin. 

At nine months the child was 
still unborn. By then Robin was 

75 




growing hysterical about more 
than the fun things she was missing 
and the freckles she was getting. 
She called her father and her 
astrologer and a guru she had met 
at the Bengal Hudson. They all 
advised her to demand a 
Caesarean section, but the knife 
terrified her. 

She had passed ten months when 
Nick and Kyrie came to call. It was 
a sunny afternoon and Marko 
had taken the babies and their 
mothers on a tour of the complex. 
They had watched a spaceplane 
roaring off toward the Earth plat- 
form and an ancient Indian build- 
ing a mountain of juniper fire- 
wood on a tiny burro and a tall 
cactus blooming — watched all 
with the same silent intentness, 
but a chance glimpse of the Sky- 
gate Hudson tower sent the chil- 
dren into shrieking fits. 

Their whooping eagerness was so 
insistent that Marko drove them to 
the hotel. Robin wouldn’t see 
them at first. My brother came 
down to meet them in the lobby. 
With an embarrassed glance at 
Carolina, he said his wife was not 
receiving anyone. 

Nick and Kyrie refused to be 
taken away, however, and 
evidently the unborn child in the 
tower suite somehow sensed their 
presence. While the mothers were 
still trying to quiet the screaming 
babies, Robin’s nurse burst in with 
a whispered message for Tom. 



He asked Marko to wait, while 
he went back to Robin. A few min- 
utes later he came down again. 
Looking pale and shaken, he 
announced that his wife had | 
changed her mind. She wanted to | 
see Nick and Kyrie. Their mothers 
could come if they liked. 

Carolina chose to wait in the lob- 
by, but Suzie Thorsen told me 
later what happened up in the 
suite. They found Robin sprawled 
on a chaise lounge, under a heap of 
pillows and blankets that failed to 
conceal the bulge of her belly. The 
maid, the nurse and my brother 
were hovering over her uneasily. 
Her face was streaked with un- 
becoming tears. Suzie felt sorry 
for her. 

MICK and Kyrie shrieked with 
^^Joy to see her, but their interest t 
was all in her swollen abdomen, j 
They stared at it with wide and | 
darkening eyes. They leaned | 
eagerly toward it. They prodded 1 
wildly at it when Robin tried to i 
take them in her arms. ; 

Suddenly savage, she shoved , 
them off. 

“Hideous little m-m-m-m-mon- 
sters!’’ Suzie mimicked her stam- 
mering rage with a quaint effect. 
“Horrid little b-b-b-b-bastards! 
They’re too bright to be h-h-h-h-' 
human. Take ’em away!’’ 

Marko and Suzie took them 
away. Strangely subdued, they • 
went without protest. Their huge 



76 



GALAXY 




eyes remained solemn and dark. 
They clung to each other in a 
frightened way as Marko drove 
them home and Nick was discon- 
solate when Suzie took Kyrie out 
of the car. 

Late that night, Marko and 
Carolina were awakened by 
Nick’s frantic screaming. They 
could find nothing wrong with him. 
The phone rang before they got 
him quiet and Suzie told them that 
Kyrie was also moaning and sob- 
bing in terror that had no visible 
cause. 

Hoping the two might comfort 
each other, they rushed Nick 
across town to Kyrie’s nursery. 
Sitting in the same crib, the two 
stared blankly at each other and 
howled in harmony. 

When Marko thought of the 
third child he called Robin’s suite. 
The French maid told him that she 
had gone to the hospital for a 
Caesarian delivery. Marko talked 
to her doctors, who were already 
washing up. They said they had 
waited as long as they dared. They 
refused to delay the operation. 

Nerved by a new burst of terror 
from Nick and Kyrie, Marko 
called Colonel Petrov. A nominal 
civilian, Maxim Petrov was the re- 
tired Sino-Soviet officer who had 
replaced Sherman Parkinson as 
head of the Space Studies Center. 
He had no more faith than had 
Parkinson in the altruistic ideals 
of COSMOS, but he was just as 

THEMOON CHILDREN 



anxious to discover the power of 
the moon grit. When Marko 
pointed out that Robin’s unborn 
child would be another guinea pig 
that might help him crack the 
mystery, Petrov called the hospi- 
tal. 

Robin’s surgeons huffily agreed 
to wait for additional clinical tests. 
The tests revealed an unknown 
antigen in her blood and a 
dangerous sensitivity to the 
anesthetics they had meant to use. 
They put off the operation over 
Robin’s profane protests. 

The moment she was wheeled 
out of the delivery room, Nick and 
Kyrie relaxed in their cribs and 
went happily to sleep, a week 
earlier than usual. My brother took 
Robin back to the Skygate Hud- 
son under mild sedation, sobbing 
and cursing him and his child. 

She had another month to wait, 
swelling enormously and quarrel- 
ing venomously by phone with 
everyone she knew, refusing to be 
seen by anybody except her nurses 
and her doctors and the puzzled 
staff of exobiologists and other 
specialists they had called in. 

Carolina believed that Nick and 
Kyrie were aware of her delivery 
when at last it came. They wanted 
to be together and they cooed and 
trilled excitedly, sometimes with 
expectant attention, large heads 
lifted as if they were listening. 
Whatever they perceived, it did 
not alarm them. 



77 




Robin’s delivery was normal — in 
fact easier than the obstetricians 
had expected — but her child was 
not. A lax, shapeless, sluglike 
thing, it weighed thirteen pounds. 
It was all body, the head 
grotesquely broad and flat. The 
limbs were undeveloped flippers, 
with the barest hint of human 
form. Short dark fur covered it all 
over. 

The obstetricians failed to start 
it breathing. They found no pulse 
or any other sign of life. Its 
temperature was sinking fast. 
Helplessly they surrendered it to 
the jostling specialists, who looked 
for brain waves and blood-reac- 
tions and autonomic reflexes. No 
test revealed anything. An empty 
bag of unnameable flesh, the crea- 
ture hung inert and monstrous in 
their hands. 

They declared it dead. 

V 

C AROLINA asked to see Rob- 
in’s baby. Relieved to wash their 
hands of the inexplicable, the 
doctors let her take it. She bathed 
it and held it in her arms all night. 
Its falling temperature steadied at 
eighty and finally began to rise. By 
noon next day it was awake. 

The specialists had it carried to 
Robin’s room, urging her to nurse 
it, because they were afraid to risk 
bottle feeding. Though they had 
warned her the child was 



exceptional, she hid her eyes after 
one glance and shrieked until her 
physician ordered heavy sedation. 

My brother hinted that the crea- j 
ture should simply be allowed to 
die. Merely as a biological speci- 
men, however, it was far too 
valuable to be abandoned. Many ; 
of us, besides, had caught a, 
warmer personal interest in it 
from Nick and Kyrie. Since neither . 
parent wanted to see it again, 
Marko and Carolina took it home 
until the nursery was finished. 

That nursery was actually a spe- 
cial laboratory, designed by . 
Colonel Petrov himself for the 
observation of these unique guinea ; 
pigs. A low-roofed ranch-style 
building, it looked deceptively 
homelike, but there were offices 
and instrument rooms and a 
record vault as Wll as space for all 
three children and their custo- ; 
dians. One-way mirrors and a net- 
work of sensors were built into the ; 
walls. 

Robin’s baby was moved there 1 
as soon as a room was ready, a ; 
week ahead of Nick and Kyrie. To 
Carolina’s surprise, they seemed 
to miss it painfully, even though it I 
was nearly always asleep. Allowed f 
at last to explore their own new I 
quarters there, they squealed with | 
glee when they discovered that* 
child would be with them again. 
Though most of the nurses shrank 
from its shapeless strangeness, 
they clamored to be near it, their 



78 



GALAXY 




great eyes glowing as if it were 
beautiful to them. 

By that time Carolina had de- 
cided that it was going to be male. 
She named it Guy, after the way 
she heard the shouts with which 
Nick and Kyrie greeted it. Its soft 
flippers had begun to look more 
like hands and feet and it some- 
times twitched and blinked when 
the other babies were near, though 
for several months it made no 
sound at all. 

Robin tried peyote for her 
jangled nerves and yoga to restore 
her precious figure. She returned 
to the Bengal Hudson with her 
guru and married him before the 
year was up, promising a gossip 
columnist that she would never 
bear another child. 

Divorce had done no apparent 
damage to the curious tie between 
my brother and Howard Hudson. 
Tom left his Skygate job as soon 
, as Colonel Petrov would release 
him and 1 heard that he was join- 
ing Hudson in a venture to exploit 
the astonishing discoveries on 
Mercury, where the seekers had 
begun to chart wide craters walled 
with piled nodules of alloyed 
iridium and gold — one exobiologist 
made the bizarre suggestion that 
those rich nuggets were excreted 
waste from the unknown crea- 
tures that had dug those iron- 
walled tunnels. 

In spite of those rich finds, and 
stranger ones reported on the 

the moon children 



moons of Jupiter, COSMOS had 
begun to fall apart. The rumors 
and suspicions that grew from the 
riddle of the moon grit raised new 
tensions between its uneasy 
partners. Maxim Petrov resigned 
in the wake of a scandal that linked 
him with a Sino-Soviet spy ring. 
Washington threatened to cancel 
the lease on the mesa and reclaim 
all the Skygate installations. Erik 
Thorsen became the new director 
of the Center through a precarious 
compromise and was soon ac- 
cused of setting up his own spy 
apparatus for the United States. 

N aively, as we sat one morn- 
ing over coffee in the nursery 
kitchen, I asked Marko what those 
spies were after. After all, 
COSMOS was neutral and 
international. Our research re- 
ports went out to every member. 1 
could understand Howard Hud- 
son’s interest in the seeker sur- 
veys, but we had no iridium 
boulder fields here at Skygate. 

“We have something else that 
might surprise you.” Marko gave 
me an owlish blink. “Thorsen 
questioned me the other day and 
finally warned me against his rival 
spies. What they want is informa- 
tion about the three fathers — him 
and Tom and me. About our sex 
lives.” 

“Why?” 

“The children are the most ex- 
citing results of space research up 

79 




to now — and a deeper mystery than 
the nature of whatever dug those 
tunnels into Mercury. A lot of 
scientists and several governments 
want to know whether there’ll be 
more.” 

He stirred his coffee moodily. 

“Carolina wanted another,” he 
added at last. “But the lab says my 
semen’s sterile now. Thorsen 
didn’t exactly say, but I think he’s 
impotent — and distressed about 
it. Which leaves your brother.” 

I thought that over. In the 
divorce action Robin’s lawyers had 
named a hotel manicurist, a nurse 
in the space hospital and a typist 
in the records section. Had some 
of them been secret agents? 

“Tom’s gone,” I said. “He may 
be back in space — we don’t keep in 
touch. But who would want 
another creature like his son?” 

“Don’t look down your nose at 
Guy.” Marko seemed almost hurt. 
“Nick and Kyrie idolize him. My 
wife has learned to love him, too. 
She keeps quoting proverbs. She 
says you can’t see the oak in the 
acorn.” 

That image of the acorn stuck in 
my mind, apt for all three chil- 
dren. The mystery of life showed 
special shapes in them. Delicately 
new, they kept unfolding un- 
expected strength and startling sur- 
prise. 

Marko was in charge of the nur- 
sery now, with Suzie and Carolina 
as official assistants. They nur- 



tured those seedling beings with 
love and wonder and frequent 
alarm. Guy Hood slept most of the 
time for his first few years, but 
Nick and Kyrie kept everybody 
busy recording the data Thorsen 
demanded. 

Though they looked more hu- 
man than Guy, their bodies were 
equally strange. All three possessed 
temperature regulators that 
baffled the biologists. When snow 
fell they wanted to play in it naked. 
The hottest desert sun gave them 
only a temporary tan. Nudists by 
nature, they had no use for cloth- 
ing. We learned to let them go 
without it. 

Iff ARKO tried to run intelli- 
gence tests. Even when he was 
awake, however, Guy Hood had 
no mind that anyone could mea- 
sure. Though Nick and Kyrie 
seemed happily cooperative, their 
erratic responses were a puzzle 
until Carolina discovered that 
they were making a gay little 
game of observing their observers. 

When Suzie taught Kyrie to 
wink her varicolored eyes, she 
started winking at everybody who 
tried to spy on her through the one- 
way mirrors, no matter how 
silently. Thorsen wanted to know 
how she sensed us, but- nobody 
could find the answer. 

Nick discovered arithmetic be- 
fore he could talk. Two months 
old, he began playing counting 



80 



GALAXY 




games with Carolina, pushing beads 
on a toy abacus to add and sub- 
tract integers up to ten. A month 
older, using a larger counting frame 
Marko made for him, he learned 
division and invented a system of 
his own for extracting roots. 

Beyond that point his mathe- 
matical intuitions became vaguely 
disturbing. I remember the puz- 
zled dread I felt one day in Marko’s 
office. We were watching a sales- 
man demonstrate a compact new 
computer. Carolina came in carry- 
ing Nick, who was always as eager 
as anybody to see new lab stuff. 

Not six months old and not yet 
walking, he leaned and whined un- 
til Carolina set him on the desk in 
front of the computer. The amused 
salesman pointed out the switch 
and gasped when Nick started the 
machine. He ran it for half an hour, 
tiny fists tapping out his problems 
with a gingerly care, bald head 
bobbing to bring his huge eyes with- 
in an inch of the answers. 

Abruptly, then, with a shy little 
smile that seemed to hide boredom 
with the machine and amused won- 
der at all of us, he tore the paper 
tape from the machine. Before 
Carolina could help he slid through 
a chair to the floor and scurried 
back to rejoin Kyrie where she sat 
in the hall, hammering an empty 
pabulum tin with a teaspoon and 
the plastic case of Marko's slide 
rule, beating out an irritating 
rhythm that somehow stuck in my 



mind so that I can still recall it. 

1 asked the salesman not to talk 
about the children, but when he was 
gone 1 discussed that disquieting 
incident with Marko and Carolina. 

“Sometimes those two frighten 
me,” Marko admitted. “I got the 
oddest feeling just now that Nick 
can think circles around our new 
computer.” 

Carolina put a warning finger to 
her lips, though he had closed the 
sound-proof office door. 

“What are they?” 1 almost shiv- 
ered when I recalled the enigmatic 
amusement on Nick’s elfin face 
as he crumpled that discarded tape. 
“What will they be when they are 
grown?” 

“Guy’s the one who worries me,” 
Carolina whispered. “The other 
two are happy. Bright as they are, I 
understand them most of the time. 
But Guy’s different. A different 
breed. I think I love him just as 
much — he does need love. But 1 
can’t help feeling that he was born 
for tragedy. I’m afraid for Guy!” 

DIVERSITY 

VI 

O UR work with the children was 
wonder and delight, at least for 
the first few years. Carolina used 
to say they were like the blooms of 
some exotic tropic bulb unfolding. 
With each new day they brought 
us glad surprises. 



THE AAOON CHILDREN 



81 




Music was Kyrie’s first interest, 
but she seemed bored with all our 
favorites before she learned to 
talk. She began beating out her 
own music on any resonant object 
she could reach, sometimes trilling 
it in a keen mocking-bird voice, in- 
venting complex scales that seemed 
difficult and unmelodious to us. 

Seven months old, Nick walked 
his first steps on the same morning 
she uttered her first careful sylla- 
bles. Gravely intent, they tutored 
each other all day. 

That afternoon they swayed 
hand in hand to meet Carolina, 
proudly cooing in unison, “Watch 
us — walking!” 

Nick learned to read before they 
were two, apparently from a set of 
picture-books about the planets. 
He taught Kyrie. They were not 
yet three when Marko found them 
one morning on the nursery floor, 
huddled over his desk dictionary. 

“Now.” Kyrie’s bird-voice had 
an interrogative lilt. “Biocosm?” 

She turned the pages to find the 
word and Nick bent over the book, 
his whole head sweeping the lines 
at a distance of two inches. 

“A planetary ecology of related 
and compatible bioforms.” He 
formed each word with painful pre- 
cision, mispronouncing one or two 
he had probably never heard. 
“Though all known biocosms of 
the solar system display certain 
similarities, biological materials 
from one biocosm are generally 



useless or poisonous to members 
of another.” 

“What does that mean?” Kyrie 
looked up at Marko. “Uncle Yuri, 
what is a biocosm?” » 

“A chain of life,” Marko said. 
“Here on Earth, we all belong to 
a single chain. Cows eat grass and 
we eat cows and the grass grows 
on animal stuff. We breathe out 
carbon dioxide the grass needs and 
the grass breathes out oxygen for 
us. In our own biocosm we are all 
made of similar chemicals and we 
are all adjusted to one another.” 
Nick nodded brightly, but Kyrie 
was still frowning. 

“We call our own world the al- 
pha biocosm,” Marko said. “Our 
space machines have to carry little 
alpha biocosms, because we can’t 
breathe the air on any other world 
or eat the things that grow there. 
The beta-forms of Venus and the 
delta-forms of Jupiter can’t fit in- 
to our chain. That’s a problem for 
space explorers. Different bio- 
cosms can’t easily be friends.” 
“Thank you. Uncle Yuri.” Ky- 
rie shook her head, still unsatis- 
fied. “Now what about Guy? 
Does he belong — ” she caught her 
breath — “to our biocosm?” 

“We don’t know much about 
Guy.” Marko hesitated uncom- 
fortably. “We’re learning all we 
can. We want to help him grow up 
and be happy.” 

“Please — help Guy!” Her small 
voice quivered. “We need you, 



82 



GALAXY 





83 




Uncle Yuri. You and Aunt Caro- 
lina and Uncle Kim. Because my 
own man-father is afraid of Nick 
and me and he doesn’t love Guy at 
all!” 

We tried to help all three. Nick 
and Kyrie needed little teaching. 
Nick soon began consuming books 
with a computerlike efficiency that 
almost alarmed me. After music, 
Kyrie found and dropped a dozen 
other interests, as if searching for 
something she could not identify. 

E ARRANGED a vacation 
tour for Nick and Kyrie dur- 
ing the summer they were four. 
Though we had trouble with hostile 
crowds in several cities, the chil- 
dren made a light-hearted game of 
evading both mobs and protectors. 
Nick learned Ukranian from Mar- 
ko’s father in Lucerne and picked 
up spoken Japanese from Suzie’s 
mother in Honolulu— he was dis- 
appointed when she didn’t know the 
ideograms. 

Though Nick seemed to be 
drinking in everything with big- 
eyed delight, Kyrie made us cut the 
trip short. Guy had been left at 
Skygate because of the spreading 
fear of space aliens and Kyrie kept 
fretting that he was lonely. Per- 
haps he was. He squirmed against 
her like a hungry kitten when he 
saw her again and mouthed a 
sound she said was her name. 

Guy was now awake three or 
four hours at a time, though he 

84 



slept for days on end. His furry 
limbs had begun to develop, but 
all his movements were still slug- 
gish and uncertain. Kyrie got him 
to stand that summer, towering 
over her like a gray ogre, but an- 
other year had passed before he 
could walk or speak. Even then, 
his speech was a slurred mumble 
that she had to translate for the 
rest of us. 

Somehow Guy became a special 
friend of mine. Perhaps I found it 
easy to forgive, his slow gray 
strangeness because he was my 
brother’s son. He seemed to show 
a kind of animal affection for me 
even before I could understand his 
voice, when he snuggled up for me 
to stroke his fur. 

As he became aware enough to 
miss his parents, I suppose he tried 
to replace them with me. 1 remem- 
ber a painful scene in the nursery 
during the summer he was five. 
Kyrie had been sitting on my knee. 
She slipped down when Guy sham- 
bled in. Perhaps he wanted her 
place, but he had grown too heavy 
to be held. He leaned over me, 
whining and clumsily pawing at 
me. A wave of his special odor 
struck me — a sharp clean scent, a 
little like a dry barnyard. 

“Little Guy wants to know what 
he is.” 1 smiled when Kyrie called 
him little, but she was very serious. 
“He wants to know why he’s not 
like Nick and me. He can’t see 
why he has no father and no moth- 




GALAXY 




er to love him and make him beau- 
tiful.” 

Robin was on the moon by then 
with her fourth husband, a luna- 
culture faddist who was converting 
the Crater Hudson into a low-gee 
rejuvenation mecca for aging bil- 
lionaires. My brother had managed 
to disappear completely. 

“You’re all right, Guy.” I 
touched his naked fur. “You do 
have parents. They’re traveling. 
Your mother’s on the moon, but 
I’m sure she often thinks of 
you — ” 

He mouthed a savage sound. 
Kyrie rushed to him and reached 
up to wrap her golden arms around 
him. Tears welled out of her mid- 
night eyes. 

“We do love you, little Guy.” 
She looked helplessly at me. “He 
wants to know why he’s something 
nobody — hardly anybody loves.” 

“Tell him the three of you are 
different.” Though 1 knew Guy 
could understand, I found myself 
speaking to Kyrie instead. “Dif- 
ferent — and very wonderful! Tell 
him we’re working in the lab to 
find out why.” 

1 was trying to look into Guy’s 
face, but its inhuman strangeness 
distracted me. The eyes were wet 
lumps, yellow-rimmed, with no ex- 
pression I could read. They stared 
without winking. Slow tears ran 
out of them to make streaks down 
his furry cheeks. His voice croaked 
dismally again. 



“Little Guy — you, too, are won- 
derful.” Kyrie gulped and looked 
at me, her enormous eyes almost 
accusing. “He says he’s dull and 
ugly like a toad. He wants to know 
why he isn’t beautiful and bright 
like Nick.” 

There was nothing 1 could say. 

I N THE publicity office we had a 
variable mission. At first we tried 
to sell the children as the exotic 
and delightful wonder-babies of the 
moon. When that program began 
to sour we tried to shield them 
from all the fear and fury we could 
not prevent. 

Once I showed Marko our file of 
hatemail. Its growing virulence 
sickened me. Writers called the 
children filthy names, accused 
them of kinship with the enemy 
biocosms on the other planets, 
even demanded their destruction. 

“To a lot of people,” I told 
Marko, “they’re monsters. Not 
just Guy — though I guess he does 
look the part. But Nick and Ky- 
rie, too. 1 can’t understand it. Why 
should anybody hate them?” 

“They’re vulnerable.” He slow- 
ly crumpled an ugly letter. “I sup- 
pose we all look for demons out- 
side when we can’t endure what’s 
in ourselves. We project our hates 
upon them. The creatures of Mer- 
cury and Venus and Jupiter might 
do for demons, but they are out of 
reach. The children are strange and 
here and vulnerable.” 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



85 




“But they’re human,” 1 pro- 
tested. “Partly, anyhow.” 

“Partly.” Marko scowled at the 
paper ball. “But partly not. I sup- 
pose that explains the irrational 
nature of the hatred.” He nodded 
somberly. “The horror of the old 
taboo against sex between beasts 
and men.” 

1 often thought of that. Guy at 
least, with his sullen moods and 
shaggy fur, must have seemed as 
alien to people outside as the beta- 
life of Venus was. Though Nick 
and Kyrie were appealingly human 
most of the time, I remember dis- 
quieting bits of strangeness. 

Even their play sometimes dis- 
turbed us. I remember walking in- 
to the nursery one afternoon, the 
summer they were four. Absorbed 
in the game, they ignored us. Nick 
kneeled on the floor, carefully 
erecting a tower of white plastic 
blocks. Kyrie was dancing around 
and around him on tiptoe, carry- 
ing an old golf ball over her head 
and buzzing in an odd way through 
her teeth. Guy squatted near them, 
following the ball with his sleepy 
yellow stare. I was smiling at their 
grave intentness, but Marko froze. 
“Nick! What’s all this?” 

“Just a game. Dad.” 
Painstakingly, Nick crowned his 
tower with a bright orange block. 
Marko bent to stare. Nick glanced 
at Kyrie. Her buzzing changed. 
Dancing closer, she brought the 
golf ball down along a spiral path 



and placed it on a shelf of the tow- 
er. 

“Nick — ” Marko’s voice was so 
queer and high that Kyrie gave 
him a wondering look. He caught 
his breath and tried again. “Where 
did you learn this game?” 

“Just made it up.” 

“Will you tell me about it?” 

“You saw it. Dad.” Nick 
shrugged. “That’s all it is.” 

“But 1 can’t understand what I 
saw.” Marko turned to Kyrie, al- 
most desperately. “Can’t you help 
me?” 

“I’ll try. Uncle Yuri.” She nod- 
ded solemnly. “In the game, we 
don’t belong. We’re spacefolk ma- 
rooned on earth. We find a way to 
send a message to our own far peo- 
ple and they send a ship to pick us 
up.” She touched the ball. “This is 
the ship.” 

“The tower.” Marko’s pointing 
finger trembled. “What is that tow- 
er?” 

Kyrie turned to Nick, puzzled. 

“It’s a tachyon terminal.” He 
spoke the words with a careful 
precision. “You see. Dad, the ball 
is a tachyon ship. That means it 
goes faster than light out in the 
space between stars. But here it 
needs a proper terminal, with a 
tachyon beacon to show it where 
to land.” 

“I — I see.” Marko gulped, try- 
ing hard to play the game. “But 
how did you learn about tach- 
yons?” 



86 



GALAXY 




“In a book.” Guy nodded vague- 
ly toward the nursery library. “A 
book about ships and stars. The 
writer said tachyon ships would 
never work, because the speed of 
light is a barrier we could never 
pass. Maybe he’s right. We’re only 
playing a game. In the game we 
just skip around the barrier, by us- 
ing a minimum-energy shift of 
state.” He must have seen my puz- 
zled look, because his elfin face 
grew graver. “You see, that con- 
verts the mass of the ship to the 
tachyon state at any speed we like.” 

“I — I see.” Marko was blinking 
again at the plastic tower. “Why 
did you build it just that way, 
Nick? 1 mean, with those seven 
columns and the colored block at 
the top.” 

“I don’t know. Dad.” Nick 
shrugged, with a look of bored im- 
patience. “After all, it’s just a 
game.” 

“And Guy is sick of it,” Kyrie 
piped. “Because he doesn’t dig 
tachyons. If you will please excuse 
us now, he wants to go out to the 
pool.” 

Still unable to walk alone, Guy 
whined eagerly. Kyrie ran to him 
and waited for Nick to help. To- 
gether they hauled him upright. He 
tottered away between them, a gray 
ungainly beast. 

T he toy tower was left behind. 
Its stacked blocks were cylinders 



of a common magnetic plastic 
from a set Carolina had given 
Guy. 1 saw nothing special about 
them, but Marko ran for his cam- 
era to film the tower and made me 
dictate a record of the whole in- 
cident, before he would answer 
my questions. 

“That’s a model of the terminal 
I saw — or thought I saw — where 
the grit brought us down on the 
moon,” he told me then. “The sev- 
en clustered columns. The rising 
spiral of landing stages around the 
taller central column. That colored 
beacon at the top.” He frowned 
at me and shook his head. “I’d like 
to know where they got that 
game.” 

“Let’s look.” 

We found the book about ships 
and stars, but there was no picture 
of a tachyon terminal. Carolina 
assured us that she had never told 
the children that much about the 
grit and the riddles of their origin. 
After a long and fruitless discus- 
sion our reports went into the file 
of unsolved problems. 

While that file grew thicker, year 
by year, COSMOS slowly crum- 
bled. Politicians began to call it a 
nest of spies and traitors. Our 
budgets were sliced. Able people 
quit. Though we tried not to alarm 
the children with any news of out- 
side dangers, 1 remember some- 
thing Carolina said. 

We were in the exobiology lab, 
where she still worked after hours. 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



87 




Blue sterilizing lamps washed the 
walls with a pale, painful light. 
Whispering from the filters, the 
air was still thick with the queer 
scent of the beta-life bubbling in 
the glass-walled incubators — a 

stinging reek like molding hay. She 
had been showing me her slides and 
models of those microscopic aliens 
with a glow almost of love, but her 
animation died when I spoke of the 
future of COSMOS. 

“It’s like the sand castles we 
used to build on the beach when I 
was a kid. The sea keep eating at 
them. I’m afraid of what will hap- 
pen to the children when it’s gone.’’ 

“Perhaps it won’t go.’’ 1 felt im- 
pelled to defend the future of the 
organization, not from any real 
faith in it, but I suppose because 
hopeful promotion had been my 
profession. “I know they keep 
cutting our budgets. But we can 
make a strong case for the seeker 
project at least, now that it’s 
finally paying off.’’ 

1 was thinking of the new wealth 
and knowledge that space had be- 
gun to promise. The diggers of 
those ironwalled tunnels into 
Mercury had yet to show them- 
selves, but the seeker craft were re- 
porting unbelievable billions of 
tons of iridium and gold in the 
nuggets that formed those crater- 
like ridges around the tunnel 
clusters. 

Critics objected that gold wasn’t 
yet worth its freight from Mer- 



cury, but Jupiter was already 
seeming to offer more exciting 
knowledge and cheaper transpor- 
tation. Flying objects had ap- 
peared near that giant planet — 
gathering and wheeling as if to 
observe the spacemen towing the 
prefab sections of Jupiter Station 
One — moving with such remark- 
able speed and freedom that cap- 
tured specimens were expected to 
reveal some radical new principle 
of space travel — if specimens could 
be captured. 

The bold passes and swift es- 
capes of those Jovian beings 
seemed to prove some kind of in- 
telligence. The indications of ad- 
vanced life on Venus and Saturn 
were not quite so clear. A second 
station in orbit above the newly 
mottled clouds of Venus had re- 
cently reported an unexplained 
loss of power before it ceased 
transmission. No Saturn probe 
had ever returned, or sent back 
any report at all from the close 
vicinity of the ringed planet. 

“Why should we fear our neigh- 
bors in space?” 1 asked Carolina. 
“They’ve been next door to us for 
several billion years, and they 
haven’t hurt us yet.” 

“It’s not the planets I fret 
about,” she said. “It’s people. Be- 
ing black, I can’t see human nature 
quite like you do, Mr. Hodian. I’m 
afraid we’re not as noble as the 
founders of COSMOS wanted us 
to be. That’s why we must give the 



88 



GALAXY 




children a chance. I hope they’ll be 
wiser than we ever were.” 

For a moment we stood silent, 
brooding over their uncertain 
future. 

“Of course 1 want to know what 
dug those tunnels into Mercury,” 
she went on suddenly. “And why 
our Saturn probes don’t get back. 
But I think human nature is a big- 
ger danger. To COSMOS. To the 
children. Maybe even to our sis- 
ter biocosms.” 

She paused to frown at the in- 
cubator where her reeking beta- 
cultures grew in frothing flasks of 
milky liquid. 

“We’ve had trouble for years 
with some unknown agent that 
kept killing off the cultures,” she 
said. “Now I think I’ve found the 
killer. If the more advanced 
Venusians dislike human beings, 
perhaps they have a reason.” 

WHAT was all she told me then, 
* because she wanted to repeat 
some of her experiments, but she 
called me back a few nights later, 
along with Marko and Thorsen, to 
hear about her discovery. When 
we gathered around a table in the 
lab, she tried to hand Thorsen a 
flask of pale fluid clotted with lit- 
tle brownish lumps. He held his 
nose and backed away. 

“It can’t hurt you, sir,” she as- 
sured him softly. “It was a beta 
culture, but it’s dead. I killed it 
with a drop of human juice. The 



actual lethal fraction is a com- 
mon enzyme. A human molecule 
that seems to multiply like a virus 
in the beta creatures. If the higher 
forms have no more immunity, 
one drop of human blood could 
spread a terrible contagion among 
them.” 

“So we’re poison to them?’’ 
Thorsen relaxed, grinning now at 
the flask. “I suppose they’ll learn 
to respect us.” 

“That depends on their level of 
evolution.” She gave him an odd 
look, both baffled and sad. “Any- 
how, we have other problems, 
closer to home.” 

Thorsen himself was one of those 
problems. To understand the chil- 
dren, as Carolina said, we needed 
to know precisely what the grit 
had done to the seeker’s three-man 
crew. Though my brother had dis- 
appeared, Marko and Thorsen 
were still under study. 

Except for his sterility, Marko 
displayed no. permanent effects of 
his experience on the moon. 
Though Thorsen angrily denied 
any effect on himself, he had lost 
flesh and youth and nerve. The 
flame of his hair and beard had 
slowly dulled to a rusty gray and 
his old boisterous charm had died 
into a bleak taciturnity. We had 
watched that change with sharp 
concern, yet the outcome sur- 
prised us. He tried to kill Nick. 

It was a warm autumn afteT- 
noon, the year the children were

five. Suzie had arranged a picnic, 
hoping to revive Thorsen’s fading 
interest in the children and per- 
haps also in herself. Nick didn’t 
want to go, but Kyrie thought Guy 
would enjoy the outing. 

Trouble began when Thorsen 
commanded the children to dress. 
Kyrie slipped obediently into a 
sunsuit and brought shorts for 
Guy, but Nick came out naked. 
Thorsen lost his temper and 
shouted a new command. Nick 
said quietly that he didn’t need 
clothes and wouldn’t wear them. 

Thorsen called him indecent and 
pulled him out of the car. He 
walked quietly back to the nur- 
sery. By that time Suzie was cry- 
ing and Guy had begun to moan. 
Kyrie ran after Nick and brought 
him out in a pair of red swim 
trunks. 

1 watched them drive away in 
Suzie’s new electric car — a gift 
from Thorsen in the wake of some 
earlier domestic incident they 
wouldn’t talk about. He looked 
grim and gloomy at the wheel, but 
Kyrie was soon happily excited, 
showing everything to Guy. 

A n hour before they were to 
return the hospital called us. 
We found all three children laid out 
in the emergency ward, splashed 
with blood and grime, limp as 
death. 

Carolina rushed to them and 
soon assured us that they were 

90 



only sleeping. Mark and 1 left her 
to tend them, while we tried to 
learn what had happened. Suzie 
had driven them back in the car, 
but she was battered and 
exhausted, already under seda- 
tion. A police airtrac picked Thor- 
sen up at the picnic spot. His deep 
facial scratches were still oozing 
blood. He glared at us sullenly and 
told the officers to take him on to 
jail. 

We got the story the next day, 
when Suzie and Kyrie were awake. 
The explosion had come when the 
new car stalled on the last rocky 
climb toward the seep we called 
the Indian spring, where they had 
planned to eat. Thorsen lifted the 
hood, read the fuel cell handbook 
and finally said they would have to 
wait for help. 

But Nick spoke up. He said the 
cell just needed adjustment and 
reached past Thorsen to twist a 
relief valve. The motor hummed at 
once, but Thorsen came apart. 
Gasping with a wordless fury, he 
seized Nick’s throat and swung 
him off the ground. 

Suzie screamed, while Nick 
kicked and strangled, but Thorsen 
ignored her. She attacked him, 
clawing wildly at his face. He 
freed one hand long enough to slap 
her off the road. Guy hugged 
Thorsen’s leg, mewing like a hurt 
kitten, as the man shook Nick 
with both hands again. 

Kyrie was more effective. She

found the jeweled rescue gun in 
Suzie’s purse — a gift from Thorsen 
liimself when he had brought his 
bride back from the moon to the 
turbulent Earth. One quick jet 
knocked him out. 

Nick was limp by then,, but 
Kyrie knew he was still alive. She 
helped Suzie load him into the car 
and waited until they were safe on 
the mesa pavement before she 
herself went to sleep. 

Released by the police when 
Suzie wouldn’t file charges, Thor- 
sen took a room at the Skygate 
Hudson. Marko and 1 tried to 
question him there. His patched 
face looked pale and drawn and his 
breath had a faint alcohol reek. At 
first he wouldn’t talk at all. 

“No, I’m not drunk!’’’he burst 
out at last. “Yesterday I wasn’t 
even drinking. The whole thing be- 
came just too much for me when 
that smart-faced kid fixed the car. I 
can’t stand ’em any longer.” 

“But they’re our children.’’ 
Marko blinked in owlish astonish- 
ment. “Little Kyrie’s your own 
daughter.” 

“A damned cuckoo!” His face 
was red and twitching now. 
“They’re all cuckoos. Something 
planted ’em in us — to be hatched in 
human bodies. But they’re actually 
no kin. No more human than a 
crocodile!” 

“You can’t believe — ” 

“We’ve been damned fools!” He 
raised his voice to drown Marko’s. 



“Trying to bring them up — to take 
the world away from us. They’ve 
got to be exterminated.” 

We stood staring. I couldn’t 
understand him. After a moment 
he staggered away as if exhausted 
by his own trembling violence. 

“1 guess I was a fool today, let- 
ting that little devil tempt me to 
touch him, but they’re all too much 
for me. Too clever and too quick. 1 
saw that months ago.” He paused 
to peer at us, bewildered and 
afraid. “Can’t you see what de- 
mons they are?’’ he whispered 
desperately. “Can’t you see what 
they’re scheming to do?” 

Vll 

T HORSEN’S assault on Nick re- 
vealed new fissures in the sand 
castle of COSMOS. The directors 
quarreled with the doctors at the 
space hospital about his sanity, 
but he was finally relieved of his 
post and transferred to a psy- 
chiatric clinic for treatment. The 
directors failed at first to agree 
on a man to replace him. They fin- 
ally called Marko into a closed 
meeting and sent him back as act- 
ing head, with a new program for 
the Center. 

“Half the directors think Erik 
was right.” He shook his head 
gloomily. “They’d like to get rid 
of the children. Since they don’t 
know how to do that they want us 
to watch them. We’re to record 



themoon children 



91 




every change we see. Report every 
word and every act.” 

The crumbling castle thus be- 
came a sort of prison, but we were 
able to keep the children safe in- 
side it a little longer. Though the 
new joint research committee 
gave us no funds for formal re- 
search, Nick and Kyrie were turn- 
ing sharper minds than ours to the 
riddle of their own existence. 

Trying to shield the children, 
Carolina had often warned us not 
to talk to them about the alien bio- 
cosms and the riddle of their own 
origin. When they began asking 
questions about themselves, her 
first answers were evasive. 

“Of course you three are differ- 
ent,” she used to say. “You’re the 
moon babies. Your fathers were 
the moon men. That’s why you’re 
all so special and so precious. 
You aren’t like us poor dull earth 
people at all.” 

They outgrew such simple 
answers. The spring they were sev- 
en, Nick found Carolina’s name in 
a child’s book about “our neigh- 
bors in space.” He brought it to me 
to ask if Dr. C. Marko was act- 
ually his mother. When I said she 
was, he and Kyrie demanded a 
tour of the exobiology lab. 

Carolina reluctantly agreed, 
though she masked them cauti- 
ously against infection by some 
alien organism. Kyrie clung close 
to me, frightened into silence by 
the strange smells and machines. 



Nick was eagerly excited, shout- 
ing breathless questions through 
the gauze. 

Huge-eyed, he peered at flasks of 
cultured beta-life. He squinted 
and prodded at a coiled iridium 
nugget from Mercury. He blink- 
ed at projected films of the snake- 
shaped creatures that had come 
out to circle Jupiter Station. 

As we were about to leave, sud- 
den bells jangled. Automatic 
doors thudded shut, sealing the 
hall ahead of us. A blinding violet 
glare flooded the glass-walled cor- 
ridors around the incubators. 

“Uncle Kim!” Kyrie gripped 
my hand. “What’s this?” 

I was unnerved, but Carolina 
seemed delighted. 

“Don’t fret.” She gathered both 
children in her arms. “It’s just the 
beta-life. Sometimes it changes 
shape', you see. Like tadpoles 
changing into frogs or grubs into 
butterflies.” 

She turned more gravely to me. 

“We’ve been observing this for 
several months, though we don’t 
yet have data for a formal report. 
The cultures bubble along for gen- 
eration after generation in sin- 
gle-cell form. But now and then 
something happens. The cells 
combine into an amazing meta- 
morph.” 

“Let’s have a look.” 

She made us wait while she got 
into a plastic gown and went back 
through double doors into the in- 



92 



GALAXY 




cubator block to bring a stop- 
pered flask to the glass barrier 
where we could see it. The children 
gasped and stared. 

The milky fluid in the bottle had 
become a big scarlet bubble, 
oddly spotted with gold and 
black, fringed with silky silver 
tendrils. With an uneven rhythm 
it expanded against the walls of 
the flask and contracted again, as 
if trying to breathe. 

“Poor creature!” Kyrie whis- 
pered. “It wants out." 

C AROLINA set the flask on a 
stand. We stood there half the 
afternoon, watching the im- 
prisoned thing while she made 
notes and photographs. Vigorous 
at first, its breathing movements 
became irregular and slow. 

“That bottle’s choking it.” 
Kyrie looked accusingly at 
Carolina. “Can’t you set it free?” 
“Our breath would kill it.’’ 
Carolina patted Kyrie’s golden 
shoulder, soothingly. “We’d all 
like to help, but it can’t live in our 
biocosm.” 

We saw it die. Its last fluttering 
movements ceased. Its vivid colors 
faded into leaden grays. The bub- 
ble burst and shrank, its fragile 
membranes dissolving into a few 
drops of brown liquid mud. 

Its odor reached us when 
Carolina opened the doors, a thin, 
revolting sweetness a little like 
rotten eggs. I wanted to leave, but 

the MOON CHILDREN 



Nick and Kyrie had questions to 
ask. 

“We’re getting two or three such 
changes a week,” Carolina told us. 
“Each metamorph has a differ- 
ent color and shape. They’re all 
trying to escape — that’s why 
we’ve installed the sensors and 
the automatic doors. None has 
gotten away — or lived more than 
two hours. Really, we don’t know 
much about them yet. 

We followed her to her office 
and waited while she put away her 
notebooks and cameras. Kyrie 
nestled uneasily against my knees, 
as if frightened by what we had 
seen. Equally troubled, Nick kept 
asking questions. 

“Mother, what are we? Why do 
you keep us here — in our own spe- 
cial lab? Why do you watch us all 
the time? Are we specimens too? 
Like the meta^” He tried again, 
careful with the word. “Like the 
metamorphs?” 

“Don’t you worry, dear.” She 
tried to hug him. “You’re our chil- 
dren. We love you very much.” 
“But we are different.” He slip- 
ped out of her arms and backed un- 
certainly away. “You do observe 
us. You film us and tape us and test 
us. You keep records and file re- 
ports, just like you do for those 
funny bugs in your bottles.” 

1 felt Kyrie shiver. 

“Why?” Nick shrilled. “What 
kind of thing are we?” 

“You’re people,” Carolina said. 

93 




“But unique people. That’s why 
you’re so priceless to science. As 
well as to us.” 

“What makes us — unique?” 

“Something happened to your 
fathers out in space.” Carolina’s 
eyes were big and black as his, im- 
ploring him to understand. 
“They were the crew of a seeker 
survey craft exploring the moon. 
They found a bed of strange black 
grit splashed around an impact 
crater. Some force from that grit 
caught them and changed 
them — changed the genes of their 
sperm cells — so that you are their 
children.” 

“But they aren’t exactly our fa- 
thers? We are not exactly human?” 

“Not entirely human.” Nod- 
ding reluctantly, Carolina caught 
her breath and tried to smile. 

“Who made the grit?” Nick de- 
manded. “Who put it on the 
moon?” 

“Nobody knows,’’ Carolina 
said. “Though Yuri has a theory.” 

N ick dragged her off at once to 
look for Marko. Kyrie tugged 
me after them, her tiny hand 
trembling in mine. Nick pushed 
into Marko’s office in the nursery 
without waiting to knock. Coffee 
was brewing on his desk, bub- 
bling fragrantly through a device 
of his own invention, a complex 
hookup of glass tubes and stopper 
flasks. With a genial nod he of- 
fered to share it. 



“Father — ” Something briefly 
checked Nick’s high voice. “Yuri, 
we’ve seen a metamorph. My 
mother has been telling us about 
the moon grit and how it made us 
what we are. 1 want to see the grit 
and I want to hear your theory.” 

Marko turned off his coffee 
apparatus. 

“The joint research committee 
keeps the grit in a vault.” He blink- 
ed gravely at Nick. “What’s left of 
it. Half of what we had was used up 
in experimental study over the 
years and spies were stealing the 
rest.” 

“How do you open the vault?” 

“1 petition the joint committee.” 
Marko smiled a little at Nick’s de- 
termination. “But here’s a model 
of one grit crystal, magnified a 
hundred times.” 

The model was a shining black 
pyramid, two feet tall. It stood on 
a metal pedestal. Marko swung a 
slice of it out on hinges, to show its 
inner blackness intricately pat- 
terned with shining lines of gold 
and glass. 

“The black mass is a granular 
allotrope of carbon, elsewhere un- 
known,” he explained. “Seeded 
with microscopic thorium beads. 
Latticed in a very intricate way 
with those wafers of silicon and 
gold. Mixed with trace amounts 
of other elements.” 

Kyrie shrank back beside me, 
but Nick listened eagerly. “Your 
theory, Yuri?” 



94 



GALAXY 




“The crystals were made 
somewhere,” Marko said. “But 
not, I think, on any planet we’ve 
found. The splash pattern around 
the crater shows an impact from 
the south — the direction of our 
nearest star. I think the crystals 
were manufactured and shot to the 
moon by an unknown technology 
far ahead of us.” 

I felt Kyrie quiver. 

“By the starfolk?” she whisper- 
ed. “Our own far people?” 

“That was just a baby game.” 
Nick glanced at her reprovingly. 
“We made up the starfolk,” he 
told Marko. “But we didn’t know 
about the grit. What could it be 
for?” 

“Maybe there is an interstellar 
culture.” Marko smiled soberly 
at Kyrie. “Maybe it is spreading 
across the galaxy, from star to star. 
Maybe the grit was contained in a 
messenger missile, shot from 
Alpha Centauri to make contact 
with us.” 

“Why the grit?” Nick peered at 
the black pyramid. “Why not a 
ship?” 

“I’ve wondered for years,” 
Marko said. “At least I think 1 see 
why. I think intelligent worlds are 
too rare and too far for ships to 
find them all. I think the mes- 
senger missiles must have been 
scattered like seed across dead 
worlds and live ones — to be 
awakened by any evolving intel- 
ligence. Our seeker woke it.” 



“And we were born.” Nick nod- 
ded slowly. “Now what are we?” 
“The messengers, I imagine.” 
“So what is the message?” Nick 
looked tiny and puzzled and 
afraid. “What are we to do? If the 
grit made us, what are we /or?” 
“You’ll discover that.” Marko 
paused, with an odd look of owlish 
foreboding, before he added, “I 
think you’ll find a splendid des- 
tiny.” 

Nick smiled hopefully, but Kyrie 
was still afraid. 

“Uncle Yuri — ” Her small voice 
quivered and broke. “If Nick and 
I are messengers from the 
stars — what is poor dear Guy?” 
Uncomfortably Marko shook 
his head. 

“Tell us. Uncle Yuri. Tell us 
what your theory is.” 

“The messenger missile struck 
the moon millions of years ago.” 
His eyes shifted uneasily from her 
to the tall black pyramid. “The 
grit had to wait for us to find it. 
Too long, I think. Most of the 
crystals were damaged by micro- 
meteorites. If they are fission- 
powered solid-state devices — as I 
think they are — most of them are 
now defective.” He looked un- 
happily back at her. “I’m afraid 
their defects appear in Guy.” 

“No!” Her voice turned sharp 
with pain. “You’ve got to be 
wrong, Uncle Yuri. Poor Guy is 
not defective. We love him ex- 
actly as he is.” 



themoon children

N ick clamored to see the actual 
moon grit until Marko filed a 
requisition. The joint research 
committee took three days to ap- 
prove it, but then a security squad 
brought six crystals to the nursery, 
along with a receipt for Marko to 
sign. 

All three children came to watch 
him pour the black grit from the 
test tube to a table top. Guy cried 
out when he saw the shining bits. 
More alive than 1 had ever seen 
him, he snatched at them and 
darted away with one clutched in 
each gray fist. 

“They’re for Nick.” Marko 
looked at me. “Get them back.’’ 
Guy dropped to the floor when 1 
reached him. He was moaning 
and quivering either in ecstasy or 
pain. His eyes rolled blindly up- 
ward and his barnyard scent rose 
rank around me. His hoarse 
breathing slowed and ceased. He 
was suddenly asleep, all his body 
limp except the knotted fists. 

“Let him keep them,” Kyrie 
begged. “He needs them so.” 

Marko agreed and distributed 
the others to her and Nick. Their 
rapt delight almost equaled- 
Guy’s. Kyrie cradled the tiny 
tetrahedrons in her cupped hands, 
crooning plaintive little sounds I 
had never heard her make. Her 
palms and her bent face grew 
golden, as if tanned by some un- 
seen radiation. 

Nick was examining his own 



crystals with an air of alert intelli- 
gence, weighing them in his hand, 
listening to their ring when he 
tapped them with a fingernail, 
searching their bright triangles 
with a pocket lens. His skin was| 
turning dark. ' 

“They are nexodes.” She, 
glanced delightedly at him.? 
“Real nexodes!” 

“What’s that?” Marko started.! 
“What’s a nexode?” 

“Something we made up.” Nick 
shrugged. “In a’ game we used to 
play.” 

“What game?” Marko swung 
urgently to Kyrie. “Please tell 
me.” 

“You saw it.” Her voice was 
faint and absent, her eyes still 
fixed on the glittering crystals. 
“We were spacefolk, remember? 
Marooned and waiting for our 
people to come.” 

Marko nodded. “But 1 hadn’t 
heard of any — nexodes.” 

“It looked like this.” She 
showed the tiny tetrahedron on 
her small brown palm. “Only big- 
ger — and bright with lovely light. 
A precious, precious thing. We 
used it to locate our people . 
among the stars. And then to help 
their ship find us.” 

“How did you come to think of 
such a thing?” 

She turned uncertainly to Nick. 
“Just made it up.” Scorn tinged 
his voice. “Baby stuff. Please, let’s 
not bother about it now.”

GALAXY 




He bent again, methodically 
testing each face of one pyramid 
against each face of the other, as if 
he expected them to stick togeth- 
er. When they did not he produced 
a pocket magnet to try them with. 

T hat night, in Carolina's lab, 
we had a long discussion of 
those games and the grit. Marko 
argued for some unknown sort of 
cognition or memory expressed 
in the games. For evidence he 
brought up those unexplained 
hallucinations that captured the 
seeker crew on the moon. 

“The space terminal 1 thought 1 
saw was too much like Nick’s toy 
terminal,” he insisted. “It can’t 
be just coincidental. Through 
some medium too subtle for us, 
the grit communicates ideas.” 

“But your terminal on the moon 
wasn’t really there,” Carolina ob- 
jected. “No more than Thorsen’s 
spacefort or Hood’s gold meteor. 
The grit has been tested very 
elaborately for psionic effects, 
with negative results.” 

“Then how do you explain the 
game?” 

“Nick says he made it up. 
Perhaps he did. Other gifted chil- 
dren have invented remarkable 
imaginary worlds. The Brontes, 
for instance. Nobody claims 
theirs was real.” 

We talked on, reviewing all our 
data and a hundred published 
theories until my head throbbed 



from the blue glow of the sterile 
walls and the musty scent of the 
bubbling beta cultures, but we 
came to no conclusions. 

“Let's not fret about it,” 
Carolina said, as we were leaving. 
“The grit shaped the children. Its 
meaning is for them, not for us. If 
it can help them find themselves, 
our real obligation is only to keep 
ourselves out of the way.” 

Next day Marko tried again to 
question Nick and Kyrie. Still 
awake and still elated with the 
black grit, they seemed to under- 
stand it no better than we did. 
Asked about the games, Kyrie con- 
fessed a wistful half-belief that 
she and Nick and Guy were actual 
spacefolk, but Nick glibly quoted 
sources in books and films to prove 
that he had borrowed everything. 

Carolina had seated them on the 
edge of Marko’s desk to bring 
them closer to our level. Kyrie kept 
eyeing her precious sample of the 
grit, reluctant to think of any- 
thing else. Nick sat impatiently 
drumming the front of the desk 
with his bare heels. 

“We aren’t bugs!” His bored an- 
noyance flashed into abrupt re- 
sentment. “You can’t cut us up to 
see what makes us tick— like the 
seeker crews want to butcher the 
space snakes they’re hunting out 
around Jupiter. Why can’t you 
leave us alone?” 

“Nicky!” Kyrie caught his 
brown arm. “Don’t!” 



THEAAOON CHILDREN

But Carolina nodded soberly. 
“To a lot of people you are 
specimens, fascinating exobio- 
logical specimens. We hope to 
protect you from such cruel peo- 
ple until you learn why you were 
born. Trust us, please.” 

“Of course we trust you,” Kyrie 
whispered. “Don’t we, Nick?” 

His grin was almost sardonic. 
“We have to trust you.” 

“One more thing,” Marko said. 
“In those games, what was Guy?” 
The teasing malice died from 
Nick’s black eyes. He frowned as 
if he meant to speak, shook his 
head, finally turned unhappily to 
Kyrie. Her golden face lost color as 
she raised it from the bits of grit, 
until she looked pale and almost 
piteous. 

“That’s the bad part.” We had 
to lean to catch her stricken whis- 
per. “Because Guy never liked the 
games. He didn’t want to play. He 
said he was no kin to the spacefolk 
and he didn’t want their ship to 
come and carry us away. He 
wouldn’t help us build the tachyon 
terminal. Once he kicked it and 
scattered all the blocks.” 

“Is that so bad?” 

Her big eyes were a tragic black 
and tears glittered on her cheeks. 
She glanced anxiously at Nick. He 
made a face and shoved her 
shoulder as if to remind her that it 
was all a game, but the gestures 
failed to break her gloom. 

“The bad part was more what 1 



thought,’’ she quavered mis- 
erably. “1 thought Guy wouldn’t 
play because he loved me and 
hated Nick. I thought he was afraid 
the spacefolk would take us both 
away and leave him all alone. I was 
terribly afraid — afraid he might 
hurt Nick.” 

“Don’t cry about it.” Nick 
pushed her again. “It was all just 
baby play.” 

Kyrie turned slowly to look at 
him. 

“But Guy really does love me,” 
she whispered. “And he really 
doesn’t like it when 1 do anything 
with you, Nicky. That’s why Tm so 
afraid. Afraid!” 

VllI 

B ad news came from space that 
year. COSMOS had reached no 
friendly worlds and the cheerful 
assumption that the planets were 
oysters waiting to be opened was 
fading into fear that Earth herself 
might somehow become the 
oyster of some other biocosm. 

The Pizarros of space had found 
no new Perus to loot. Though the 
flight mechanism of the Jovian 
delta-life had promised to be a 
richer treasure than all the Incan 
gold — or even the nugget fields of 
Mercury — those elusive creatures 
still kept their secret. 

Agile as shadows, they evaded 
every effort to capture or even to 
destroy them. No ship was swift 



98 



GALAXY 




enough to overtake them. No 
human weapon could reach or 
damage them. Nearhits with 
nuclear missiles left them neither 
hurt nor offended. 

As if reciprocating human 
curiosity, they kept darting close 
to the orbital station. Compan- 
ionably they escorted the seekers 
in flight around the planet’s moons. 
They began flying out to meet ar- 
riving rockets. Finally they fol- 
lowed a returning ship all the" way 
to the Earth platform. 

Even though the delta-form be- 
ings had never tried to take any hu- 
man specimens the news of that 
visit spread consternation. To 
head off panic we released a 
theory of Carolina’s that the 
Jovians had been to Earth before. 

“They’re at home in space,” she 
said. “The evidence suggests that 
they can tolerate dry air at high 
elevations, at least for brief peri- 
ods. They seem to look somewhat 
like the flying serpents of native 
Mexican art and to move like cer- 
tain UFOs.” 

To support the theory she 
showed us the data that had come 
to her lab for analysis. Taken 
from the orbital station, one 
photograph had caught a snake- 
shaped thing in silhouette against 
the brightly streaked face of Jupi- 
ter. 

The thick serpentine form was 
darkly transparent, a twisted 
shadow across the great Red Spot. 



It had an opaque nucleus — a dark 
jagged mass like an irregular 
crystal. From that mass spread 
two wide luminous rays or plumes, 
which to some primitive Aztec 
might have looked like wings. 

“Everything suggests they’ve 
been making casual calls for cen- 
turies,” Carolina said. “Without 
hurting anybody. I doubt that 
they can metabolize the products 
of our biocosm. Except for short 
visits to the highest, dryest moun- 
tains, Earth is not for them.” 

“Then why,” 1 asked, “would 
they be interested in us?” 

Her faint smile looked wry. 
“Perhaps because we’re inter- 
ested in them.” 

The news from Mercury was 
more disturbing. Computer 
analysis of the tapes from the 
seeker survey had revealed no 
life or motion on the surface of 
that hot planet. Now the 
COSMOS command on the 
orbital platform sent a landing 
group to test a notion that the tun- 
nel diggers were either dead or de- 
parted. The notion turned out to be 
unfortunate. 

The group reported a safe land- 
ing at their selected site on the rug- 
ged highlands, near the tunnel 
cluster they were to investigate. 
As the orbital platform moved out 
of contact, they had Just begun 
blasting, to level the site and ex- 
cavate a shelter tunnel of their 
own. 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



99 




Two hours later, with contact 
restored, they reported evidence 
that Mercury was still alive. Dur- 
ing a pause in the blasting, their 
seismographs had picked up a se- 
ries of rhythmic tremors from the 
direction of the tunnel cluster. 

By the time the platform came 
overhead, some kind of smoke or 
vapor was pouring out of the tun- 
nels. It rapidly obscured the 
sixty-mile plain and began to spill 
over. 

Because of the small planet’s 
close horizons, this cloud was not 
yet visible to the surface group, 
but the platform commander or- 
dered it to halt drilling and to pre- 
pare for take-off. What happened 
next was never discovered. 

A narrow tongue of that bright 
fog was pushing toward the land- 
ing site as the platform moved out 
of range again. The commander 
tried to order an immediate take- 
off, but laser contact was already 
broken. The landing group was 
gone when the platform came 
back over the site and the last wisps 
of fog were disappearing from 
the crater basin, draining like a 
liquid back into the tunnels. 

The commander decided not to 
risk another surface expedition, 
but photographs of the site showed 
a few small scattered scraps of 
wreckage, indicating that the 
landing craft had crashed or ex- 
ploded soon after takeoff. The 
bodies of the men, along with most 



of the wreckage, had been some- 
how removed. 

ELAYED to the COSMOS 
directorate at Skygate, the 
reports of that incident set off a 
new debate. One fraction wanted 
to withdraw all missions from 
Mercury. Another wanted to 
bombard the tunnels with nuclear 
missiles. As a compromise, orders 
were relayed for the platform 
commander to climb into a high- 
er orbit and prepare to defend 
himself. What proved to be the 
last transmission from the plat- 
form had already been received. 
It was a routine signal that com- 
munication would be blacked out 
again while the platform passed 
behind the planet. Nothing else 
came through. 

After another hot debate, the 
directorate canceled plans to 
send a rescue expedition. The ex- 
ploration of Mercury ceased, the 
nature of the tunnel-diggers still 
unknown. 

In the wake of this disquieting 
disaster, COSMOS budgets were 
slashed again. The uncompleted 
orbital stations around Saturn 
and Neptune had to be abandoned 
and plans were canceled for a se- 
ries of transplutonian probes. 

At Skygate our difficulties 
multiplied. In spite of all our 
publicity efforts, people tended 
to identify the children with the 
enigmatic beings of those other 




100 



GALAXY 




biocosms. We ourselves were sus- 
pect. The security force received 
secret orders, as we later discov- 
ered, to watch us as well as our 
charges. 

Nick was begging for permission 
to study a larger sample of the 
moon grit, but the joint research 
committee disapproved Marko’s 
requisition for it. Some members 
doubted that a child could accom- 
plish anything significant. Others 
feared that Nick might do too 
much. 

Waiting fretfully, he spent most 
of his time in his mother’s lab- 
oratory. He learned to culture the 
beta-life. He skimmed through all 
her reference books and her filed 
data on the other biocosms. He 
studied new closeups of the Jovian 
delta-forms, made from the Earth 
platform. 

One of those photographs had 
caught the snake-shape of a delta 
creature in outline against the 
cloud-swirled Earth. With sharper 
eyes or perhaps a sharper mind 
than anybody else, Nick discov- 
ered a puzzling structure of fine 
black lines that branched from the 
jagged nuclear crystal out into 
the serpentine shadow. 

He spent two days mapping 
those barely visible lines, record- 
ing each with a microscopic exact- 
ness. For another sleepless night 
he sat cross-legged on the nursery 
floor, scarcely moving, “just 
thinking.” Finally he approach- 



ed his mother with a question. 

“Do the COSMOS people still 
want to know how the delta things 
propel themselves?” 

Carolina said they did. 

“I’ll show them,” he promised. 
“In return for freedom to study 
the moon grit.” 

She took that innocent offer to 
Marko. He carried it to the joint 
research committee. They re- 
ferred it to the directorate. Nick 
slept while he waited, but w»ke in- 
stantly when Marko came back to 
accept his proposition. 

W E ARRANGED the demon- 
stration that same afternoon. 
Two engineers came from the re- 
search committee to observe it. 
They were not impressed with his 
preparations. 

Clever enough with tools, Nick 
cut a round hole the size of a beer 
can in the center of a short pine 
board. He hammered a worn 
silver dime into a slot near one end 
of the board and a copper cent 
into a slot near the other. 

Marko and Carolina came along 
for the demonstration. Two secu- 
rity cars carried us out on the 
open mesa, a mile beyond the 
spaceport. I still recall the 
sardonic impatience of the 
engineers as they watched Nick 
completing his device. 

A thin, grave-eyed child, he 
looked too small for his seven 
years. His naked skin had been

pale in the car — out here the hot 
sun washed him with instant 
bronze. Squatting in the dust, he 
carefully fitted a can of warm 
beer into the hole in the board. 
With a soft graphite pencil he be- 
gan to draw an intricate system of 
lines that branched from the two 
coins toward the can. 

His task took time. Less im- 
pervious than he was to heat, we 
watched and sweated. I had 
brought no hat and my head began 
to throb. The engineers scowled in- 
patiently through dark glasses. A 
security man snickered when Nick 
broke his pencil point. 

Ignoring everything, Nick 
chewed his tongue and drew more 
lines until something happened. 
Though the gray horizon still 
shimmered all around us, I felt a 
sudden piercing chill. My mouth 
had a sharp metallic taste. Nick 
dropped his pencil and held his de- 
vice up triumphantly. 

“Watch!” he shrilled. “Watch it 
fly!” 

White frost filmed and feathered 
the beer can. It burst with a muf- 
fled thump and brown ice jutted 
out. A strange, edgeless dimness 
spread around the ice, veined with 
fine black lines that seemed to 
branch from Nick’s pencil marks. 
Through that spreading darkness 
I saw the board tugging upward. 
Nick clung to it, pale with alarm. 
Flakes of frost swirled and 
crackled around him in that con- 



densing shadow. Clinging to the 
ends of the board, Nick was lifted 
off the ground. 

Carolina screamed. Nick let go. 
The board whistled out of sight. 
The sun blazed back, its heat 
strangely welcome. The sky 
rumbled for endless seconds. 
Silence came like a thunder clap. A 
dazed security man stood point- 
ing at a puff of yellow dust on the 
hot horizon. I tasted that puzzling 
bitterness still in my mouth. 

Nick gathered himself out of the 
dust and the shivering engineers 
herded us into the cars. We jolted 
two miles across the mesa, to a 
shallow crater where the device 
had come down in a juniper clump. 
The engineers picked up a few pine 
splinters and a shred of twisted 
aluminum. Finally they began 
asking what the gadget was. 

“A sort of circuit,” Nick said. 
“It picks up certain forms of 
energy. From light or heat or even 
gravitation. It changes them to 
- kinetic energy.” While the 
engineers muttered and stared he 
added innocently: “The effect 
was stronger than I wanted. The 
broken pencil made the primary 
conductor marks too thick.” 

The whole affair left the 
engineers frustrated and, 1 think, 
apprehensive. They failed to 
translate Nick’s description of 
the propulsion circuit or his 
drawings of the structured 
shadow-shapes of the delta crea-

tures into any terms they could un- 
derstand. Their own copies of his 
device failed to fly. 

Their reports, however, must 
have impressed the directors. The 
research committee approved a 
requisition. An armored security 
truck brought Nick half a kilo- 
gram of the precious grit in a thick 
canister of yellow-painted lead. 

MICK eagerly attacked the tetra- 
^■hedrons. He now had access to 
the big computer and searched its 
data banks for every recorded fact 
about the grit. He repeated old ex- 
periments and invented new ones. 
Most of them failed. As weeks and 
months went by, his confidence 
shrank to grim desperation. 

Searching for help, he had us 
bring a series of scholars to Sky- 
gate. The first was Dr. Platon 
Papanek, an old colleague of 
Carolina’s, recently back from 
Uranus. Nick bombarded him 
with anxious questions about the 
possibilities of intelligence in 
other biocosms. 

“What’s intelligence?” Still used 
to low gravity, Papanek shuffled 
laboriously to a chair and wheezed 
a garbled mixture of French and 
Czech that Nick translated for the 
rest of us. “A tool for survival. A 
sharper fang, a quicker claw. Each 
biocosm plays the survival game 
according to rules of its own. The 
successful adaptations — the beta 



and delta and gamma spheres — 
can’t be compared on our alpha 
scale. You don’t measure poetry 
by the pound or wisdom by the 
yard.” 

“Is survival all?” Nick’s thin 
face turned bleak. “1 mean, sir, 
couldn’t intelligence become a 
bridge? Couldn’t it build a way for 
one biocosm to reach and under- 
stand and maybe help another?” 

“I was once an idealist.” 
Papanek shook his flaccid bulk and 
gasped for his breath. “I’ve been 
to five biocosms to look for cos- 
mic altruism. I detected none. 1 
conclude that benevolence is a 
negative factor for survival.” 

“Somewhere else?” Urgency 
quivered in Nick’s voice. “Some- 
where in the galaxy — couldn’t uni- 
versal friendship become a posi- 
tive factor?” 

“Who knows?” The heavy 
gravity of Earth damped 
Papanek’s Slavic shrug. “The 
farther out we go, the queerer 
things we find.” 

He stayed three days. Listening 
to the questions Nick and Kyrie 
asked, I felt a sharper sense of the 
urgency of their desperate search 
for the makers of the moon grit, 
but I’m afraid they got no help 
from Papanek. 

Nick sent next for an exiled 
Sino-Soviet geneticist, who turned 
out to be as ignorant as we were 
about what the grit could have 
done to the sperm cells of the seek-

er’s crew. He called in a professor 
of astronautics who cheerfully 
promised that intelligible signals 
could be sent to other stars within 
only two or three centuries if space 
technology continued to ad- 
vance. He invited a team of solid- 
state physicists, who disagreed 
scornfully with all his theories 
about the structure and the func- 
tion of the grit. 

His last quest was a math- 
ematician, a big jovial Finn. They 
spent two days and nights in the 
nursery classroom, trading sym- 
bols in a haze of chalk-dust. The 
Finn came out coffee-logged and 
reeling with fatigue. 

“Was 1 expected to instruct that 
infant?” He blinked at me in red- 
eyed wonder. “In thirty minutes 
he destroyed the work of my 
life — my model of the universe. I 
never met such power of mind. Yet 
I pity him.” The Finn rubbed in a 
dazed way at his chalky jaw. “He 
doesn’t know how to laugh.” 

N ick refused to send for any- 
body else. His feverish bouts 
of study and experiment almost 
ceased. He used to sit for hours in 
despondent thought or slip away 
from security to roam the moonlit 
mesa alone. Though he and Kyrie 
had always been immune to 
germs and viruses, Carolina 
thought he was falling ill of sheer 
frustration. 



“Goodness, child, don’t fret so 
hard,” I heard her urge him one 
morning in the nursery kitchen. 
“You’ll only kill yourself. No 
doubt you and Kyrie have tremen- 
dous things to do, but they had bet- 
ter wait till you are older.” 

“We can’t wait.” He pushed his 
untouched breakfast tray aside 
and stared at her from blue-rim- 
med eyes. “All the planets are on 
fire with danger for us. Earth 
worst of all. Our only hope is the 
message I think is in the grit, but 
time is running out for us to break 
the code. Mother, I’m afraid — ” 
His faint voice cracked. “I’m 
afraid we’ll die before we ever 
learn why we were born.” 

Such-black moods distressed us 
all, but Nick was hard to help. 
Even when his problems proved 
impossible to solve, he would not 
forget them. He saw through the 
good news we tried to man- 
ufacture and indignantly rejected 
most attempts to encourage or 
distract him. That year was dif- 
ficult, though Guy and Kyrie 
brought us occasional relief from 
his gloomy moodiness. 

Guy was heavier than 1 by now 
and nearly as tall. Awake, he had 
the unpredictable vigor of a year- 
ling grizzly and an appalling ap- 
pearance. Though he enjoyed 
clothing no more than did Nick 
and Kyrie, he had reluctantly be- 
gun to hide his shaggy strangeness 
under a shapeless old raincoat 



104

when he was outside the nursery. 

Carolina still worked when she 
could to train and study his slug- 
gish intelligence. Sometimes she 
got him to fumble clumsily with a 
teaching device or an education- 
al toy. More often he simply 
sprawled or squatted wherever he 
was, waiting dumbly for Kyrie. 
Nick’s desperate plight did not ex- 
ist for him. 

Kyrie was desperately con- 
cerned, but Nick seemed not to 
want her with him in the lab or on 
his solitary walks. Trying to learn 
enough to understand his prob- 
lems with the grit, she got Carolina 
to bring in a series of tutors for her. 

Carolina helped her choose an 
international team of genetic 
specialists and she begged them 
to tell her why Nick and Guy were 
so different. Those experts took 
new case histories of all three chil- 
dren, scowled at the grit and mut- 
tered vaguely about anomalous 
genetic mutations. 

Searching as urgently as Nick 
for any sort of understanding, 
she called in a group of noted com- 
posers, who turned out to like or 
understand her music no better 
than I did. She sent for philo- 
sophers and anthropologists, a fe- 
male psychologist, finally a 
Chilean poet. 

S HE liked the poet best. A sun- 
dried gnome with lank black 



hair and black child-eyes, he beat a 
many-stringed guitar to a whin- 
ing chant about his own Homeric 
life. A one-time spaceman, he had 
ridden seekers around a dozen 
moons and asteroids, yet never 
discovered the meaning of life. 
Kyrie must have seen Nick and 
herself in his sad songs. When he 
was gone, she wouldn’t send for 
anybody else. 

“The wisest men aren’t wise 
enough,” she told Carolina. “They 
can’t help Nick. They can’t tell us 
what we were born for. They can’t 
explain why Guy is like he is.” she 
sighed. “Really, you know — in 
spite of you and Uncle Yuri and 
Uncle Kim — the three of us are all 
alone.” 

Unable to do anything for Nick, 
she turned to Guy. His slow being 
quickened eagerly when she came 
near and she seemed not to mind 
his backward strangeness. For 
months they were always to- 
gether. They talked little — words, 
she said, were still too hard for 
Guy. But she used to sit crooning 
beside him while he slept and, 
awake, he used to whimper for her 
music. 

Music — an odd word for the 
throbs and moans and howls that 
she beat and scraped and blew out 
of unlikely bits of junk — or even 
for the wailing songs she sang. 
Those tormented sounds were nev- 
er melodious to the rest of 
us — rather, they were disturbing 



THE MOON CHILDREN 



105 




in a way I could never under- 
stand. But they set Guy to writh- 
ing and whining with an animal 
delight. 

Uncontrolled, his gorilla 
strength had become a problem 
for security. When he learned to 
like working out in the gym, he 
broke equipment and threw balls 
too hard and fractured the jaw of a 
guard who was trying to teach him 
to box. The security chief was 
afraid he might hurt Kyrie. 

She laughed at the notion of dan- 
ger from her baby Guy, but 
Carolina, observing their sex de- 
velopment, began to take it ser- 
iously. Kyrie, too, had outgrown 
Nick. Still child-slight, her figure 
had matured distractingly. 
Carolina warned and cajoled and 
ordered her to wear at least 
bikinis. She obeyed now and then. 

Though Nick had never given up 
his quest for the secret of the grit, it 
was Guy who made the break- 
through. It happened on a blaz- 
ing summer afternoon. I was sit- 
ting in the publicity office, staring 
through the window at blue mir- 
ages on the mesa and not dictating 
my daily security report, when 
Kyrie burst in, screanjing. 

“It’s the messenger stuff!” She 
was so breathless I failed to get 
the words at first. “Uncle Kim. the 
messenger stuff! Guy wants to 
show you. He’s learned what to do 
with the messenger stuff.” 

I followed her back to a play- 



room in the nursery. We found 
Nick and Guy huddled over a 
child-sized desk. Nick sat on a 
chair, naked and alert and deep 
brown. Too big for the furniture, 
Guy was crouching over the desk, 
doing something with a handful 
of the tiny tetrahedrons. 

I heard her say, “Guy knows 
how — ” 

“Shhh!” Guy hushed her, and we 
stooped to watch. 



T he grit was spread out on a 
sheet of white paper. Moving 
with a deftness that surprised me, 
Guy’s stubby, short-furred fingers 
were pushing three tiny pyramids 
into a triangular pattern. Squint- 
ing with care, a new yellow gleam 
in his eyes, he lowered the base of 
a fourth pyramid upon the up- 
right points to complete a taller 
tetrahedron. 

When that last crystal clicked 
into place, a soft blue glow lit the 
larger pyramid, brightest in its 
hollow center. Guy raised his 
browless head with a thick grunt 
of satisfaction and Nick snatched 
the thing he had made. 

“We’ve got it, Ky!” His voice 
turned shrill as hers. “He can stick 
them together. In fours, like this. 
And the fours into fours of fours, 
the way they were meant to go. 
He’s making our nexode — ” 

A savage growl unnerved me. In 
a blur of action, the little desk was 



106 



GALAXY 




splintered, black grit scattered, 
Mick flung to the floor. Kyrie bent 
over him, gasping and voiceless 
with terror. Guy lurched away, 
clutching that glowing thing 
against his belly fur. 

Two security men burst in, 
shouting at him. He lumbered to- 
ward their drawn pistols until 1 
called his name. He stopped then, 
mute and trembling. With Kyrie’s 
aid, I managed to make peace. 
The guards put up their guns and 
helped gather the spilled grit. Nick 
said he hadn’t meant to be rude and 
begged Guy to go ahead and fin- 
ish the nexode. 

Guy shook his head at first and 
clung moaning to the blue pyr- 
amid, but Nick brought the rest of 
the grit from the lab and Kryie 
coaxed him back to work. He was 
at it all that night, painstakingly 
clicking the crystals into fours 
and these into taller and taller 
steps, sixteens and sixty-fours. 
Each larger pyramid glowed with 
another color, strong at first but 
slowly fading, the sixteens green- 
ish and the sixty-fours a tawny 
topaz. 

Nick and Kyrie tried eagerly to 
help, but the art was Guy’s alone. 
Though the undamaged tetrahe- 
drons had always looked identical 
to everybody else, he selected 
each for its own place, turning and 
trying it as if to make some kind of 
invisible fit. He didn’t explain 
what he was doing and the black 



bits refused to stick together for 
the rest of us. 

Guy changed as he worked — in 
ways that are hard to explain. He 
visibly shed his fumbling clumsi- 
ness. He looked more alive and 
happier than I had seen him. His 
fur seemed to shine with a sleeker 
luster. His ungainly frame grew 
straighter— after midnight, he 
moved everything to the top of a 
filing cabinet, so that he could 
stand at his task. 

His brain was awakening, too, 
in ways less visible to me. 1 saw 
Kyrie watching the growing pyr- 
amids and Guy himself with a 
breathless fixity. Turning abrupt- 
ly away, she wanted Nick and me 
to come with her to the kitchen for 
a snack. 

We walked off slowly. 

“It’s doing things to Guy,’’ she 
whispered, with an awed back- 
ward glance. “I don’t know how to 
say it, but I keep feeling what he 
feels. When he touches the grit, l 
feel with his fingers.” 

Nick looked blank. 

“The slick cool blocks.” Kyrie’s 
golden fingers stroked and lifted 
an invisible pyramid. “The edges 
like black blades. The pattern of 
the faces — all threes of threes. 1 
caught other feelings, too.” 

Her amused eyes flashed at me. 

“He’s really fond of you. Uncle 
Kim. He thinks you’re more like 
him than anybody else is. Not too 
smart.” 



THEMOON CHILDREN 



107 




“Ky!” Nick was startled. “How 
does he feel about me?” 

H er brief smile went out. She sat 
down in a kitchen chair too big 
for her, suddenly forlorn. 1 
brought her a glass of yeastract 
plus, but she didn’t want it. 

“He loves me,” she breathed at 
last. “I never knew how much. But 
not you. Not you, Nick.” 

“It’s nothing we can help.” Nick 
stood behind the chair, his brown 
hand just touching her golden 
shoulder, his voice quietly mat- 
ter-of-fact. “There’s one of you for 
two of us.” 

“How can you hate — ” Pain 
stifled her. “How can you hurt 
each other when I love you both?” 
“I’ll never harm Guy.’’ His 
promise had a quiet finality that 
made him seem strangely mature. 
“I couldn’t injure him, Ky. Not 
even for you.” 

Cheered by that assurance she 
decided that she was hungry after 
all. I left them at the table and car- 
ried a sandwich back to Guy. Busy 
with a new blue pyramid, he 
greeted me with a friendly grin but 
took no time to eat. 

He finished the fourth topaz 
tetrahedron before dawn. Ex- 
haustion had drained his new 
vitality by then. His gray paws 
were awkward and uncertain 
again, but he turned and tried his 
new pyramid above the other three 



until at last it snapped gently into 
place. 

“Guy, Guy!” Kyrie gasped. “It’s 
so very lovely!” 

This final tetrahedron was four 
inches tall. A cool, rose-colored 
glow shimmered along its knife- 
like edges and filled its interior 
hollow, but lingering gleams of 
yellow and green and blue clung to 
the smaller triangles that made 
up its faces, filming all its intri- 
cately patterned blackness with 
a splendid flowing glow. 

Nick was squinting at it criti- 
cally. 

“I don’t think it’s done,” he said. 
“You could make it twice as tall. 
There’s grit left over and we can re- 
quisition more.” 

“1 used all the good ones.” Guy 
shrugged disdainfully at the hand- 
ful of crystals scattered on the fil- 
ing cabinet. “These went bad. 
See?” Though the crystals had 
been nearly diamond-hard, his 
pinching fingers crumbled two or 
three of those left over into spft 
black dust. “Burned out.” 

“May I, Guy?” Kyrie reached 
eagerly toward the bright pyr- 
amid. “May 1 just touch — ” 

“Please keep it for me.” With a 
grace that astonished me, Guy set 
it in her quivering hands. “I’m 
dead — for — sleep.” 

His voice slowed and his body 
stooped and his yellow eyes grew 
dull, as he gave up the pyramid. 
He stood gaping vacantly at

Kyrie. Like some trained animal, 1 
thought, waiting dully for its next 
command. 

“Thank you, Guy.” Captured by 
the pyramid, she scarcely looked 
at him. “Go on to bed.” 

He shambled heavily away, 
already half-asleep. Turning to 
Kyrie, 1 was enchanted by the 
transformation flowing over her 
like some magic fluid from the rosy 
tetrahedron. She looked taller, 
rounder of buttock and bust. Her 
startled smile of sheer delight was 
quickly veiled with Mona Lisa’s 
mystery. Somehow the thin and 
wistful child had been clad in in- 
stant womanhood. 

What I felt was a stab of desire 
so sharp I turned away. When I 
dared to look back her golden 
gaze was on me, wise as 
Aphrodite’s, aware of all I felt, her 
mocking amusement at my dis- 
quiet mixed with a silent pride in 
her newly gained power to kindle 
it. For one astonished moment 1 
met her candid eyes, inhaling a 
wave of her lilac scent. Then she 
forgot me, peering again into that 
blazing pyramid. 

“Nicky, this is better than the 
game,” she whispered eagerly. 
“It’s our nexode — real! The rec- 
ord our people in the stars made 
for us. It will tell us who we are and 
what our lives are for — and maybe 
how to find our way to them.”

R.A. LAFFERTY 



ALL 

BUT 

THE 

WORDS 



It was hard to 
communicate with 
Albert— but even 
harder not to! 



T he IDT Project had been going 
on for a dozen years with no real 
advance toward its ends. It would 
have been abandoned long before 
except for its collateral discov- 
eries in other fields. The acci- 
dental offshoots it had produced 
were well worth the considerable 
expense of the Project. 

The Project had assigned to it 
one great mind and several very 



good minds; no other project at 
that time could say as much. The 
great mind was that of Gregory 
Smirnov, and his greatness was in 
his instant perception of the pos- 
sibilities of an idea. He always 
knew whether an idea or a notion 
had a spark in it. He discerned 
where the flightiest apparent idiocy 
carried the ultimate spark and 
where the most brilliant and most 



no 




plausible thesis did not. He played 
his colleagues like a hand of cards 
and scored every possible point. 

The several very good minds as- 
sociated with the Project were 
those of: Charles Cogsworth, the 
inventor of the Recapitulation 
Correlator, as well as the Cere- 
bral Scanner; Aloysius Shiplap 
who had been associated with the 
late Cecil Corn in the experiment 
which ended with Corn’s 
life — which may have been a dead 
end and may have been an opening 
door; the stiff-necked Garald 
Glasser, the designer of the E.P. 
Locator; Valery Mok, a woman 
of vivid eido-creation whose mind 
had put Cogsworth into a state of 
shock when first he went into it 
with his scanner. 

Also associated with the Project 
was Energine Eimer. Although 
she had a good mind by ordinary 
standards she was not in the class 
with the others; for it was really 
an understatement to speak of 
them as having very good minds. 
Energine herself was flighty to 
seeming idiocy, but Smirnov had 
detected that from her might come 
the ultimate spark. 

The purpose of the IDT Project 
was to devise an Instant Distant 
Translation device, which might 
be either mechanical or psychic, 
or something of an entirely dif- 
ferent aspect. It was to reach and 
establish rapport with a dis- 



tant — a very distant — mind, any 
mind anywhere beyond the pale. 
It would have to combine and go 
far beyond such tools as were al- 
ready available. 

Extrasensory Perception, now 
that it was known to be but anoth- 
er aspect of simple sensory percep- 
tion and of disappointing limi- 
tations, was one very inadequate 
tool. The translation devices 
themselves would be enough for 
ordinary work. They could now 
interpret roughly the thought 
processes of earthworms and 
ferns and even crystals. They 
could record and even verbalize 
the apprehensions of metals un- 
der stress and, to an extent, the 
group consciousness of gather- 
ing thunderheads. Any language, 
terrestrial or distant, could be 
given a cogent interpretation. 
But something more was re- 
quired. 



I T WAS the six hundred and 
twelfth weekly progress meeting 
of the group. 

“Energine,” said Gregory Smir- 
nov, “it has just come to me how 
you are different from the rest of 
us.” 

“In one way she’s different 
from the rest except myself,” said 
Valery, “but I’m not sure that 
you’ve ever noticed that differ- 
ence.” 



ALL BUTTHE WORDS

“I’ve known about the differ- 
ence between the sexes for a long 
time, Valery,” said Smirnov. “1 
was a precocious child and an 
early reader of biology. In my 
own life 1 have relegated the im- 
plications of the difference to a 
minor corner. There is little 
enough time in even a long life to 
do the work 1 have set for myself, 
and the ramifications of the sex 
complex are time consuming. 
No, the difference is that Ener- 
gine likes to talk to people.” 

“Does not almost everyone?” 
asked Shiplap. 

“Many do, but none of us on the 
Project except Energine,” said 
Smirnov. “We are not the sort 
who like people, and we talk to 
them as little as possible. Most- 
ly we talk to ourselves even when 
we are nominally talking to oth- 
ers. There is an inhibition in 
the — ah — cultivated minds. We 
are a withdrawn bunch and we 
tend to become more' so as we fol- 
low our specialties and our 
studies. That is the irony of it.” 

“Where is the irony?” asked 
Cogsworth. 

“We are trying to talk to ‘peo- 
ple’ over cosmic distances and we 
do not even like to talk to people 
near at hand. We do not like to talk 
to people at all. We aren’t the ones 
for the job. Mostly we are bored 
with people.” 

“Then who are the ones for the 
job?” asked Glasser. “Logorrhea 



is rampant in the world. We could 
find a billion low folks who love to 
talk to other low folks.” 

“Possibly those we will ulti- 
mately contact will also be low 
folks,” said Smirnov. “It is likely 
that the lowest common denomi- 
nator of the Universe will be both 
low and common. Rapport is 
what we want and we don’t have it. 
We can study the dragonfly, but 
are we ever really concerned with 
the dragonfly’s concern for his 
family? We don’t' really like the 
monstrous miniatures. We’ve no 
sympathy with the terrified arro- 
gance of the arachnid; how can we 
have sympathy for really strange 
creatures? How can we talk to an 
alien if we don’t even like to talk to 
our own kind?” 

“1 have a landlady who even 
talks to bugs,” said Glasser. 
“Shall I get her? She’d droodle to 
a vole on a planet just as well if we 
pointed her that way. And you be- 
lieve that she would be better than 
ourselves, who have all the tech- 
niques and information?” 

“We have Energine,” said Smir- 
nov. “She has the techniques, such 
as we all have. And she likes to talk 
to people. She might just be able 
to break us out of our restric- 
tion.” 

“Then why hasn’t she done it?” 
asked Valery. “She’s had as much 
time on the senders and scanners 
as any of us have had — and no 
more luck.”

“Because she hasn’t let herself 
go. She has been constrained to 
use our own approach and formu- 
las. Energine, let yourself go and 
talk to those people. Now. To- 
night. Talk to them!” 

“I will, I will. But how? You 
mean just like I talk? I’ve thought 
of that, but 1 didn’t think you’d al- 
low it. I bet those folks have got- 
ten awful bored with our saluta- 
tions and mathematical symbols. 
A circle is a circle, and a square is 
a square — and so are we. Hey — me 
third planet out. Who you? I bet 
they think we’re nutty to use that 
kind of stuff. 

“I’ll get hold of one of them to- 
night and tell him all about the new 
Indonesian Restaurant I found. 
Maybe he found a new restau- 
rant up there and can tell me some 
of the dishes. Whoever he is I bet 
he likes to eat, too.” 

“Energine, do you still belong to 
a Lonely Hearts Club?” 

“Why, I belong to all of them! 
Just let me read you one letter I 
got this morning. Why, it’s the 
nicest letter — ” 

“Spare us — protect us! Earth 
swallow us!” cried Glasser. 

“That, Glasser, is an illustra- 
tion of what is holding us back,” 
said Smirnov. “We don’t like to 
talk to people and we don’t like to 
listen to people. It may be that 
they have been talking to us for a 
long time and we were not in tune 
to listen.” 



“Well then, you will surely lis- 
ten, Mr. Smirnov,” cried Ener- 
gine. “This is a letter from Eu- 
gene, upstate — ” 

“No, as a matter of fact I will 
not listen,” said Smirnov. “I am 
now too old to develop a sympa- 
thy for the vital things of life. But 
what I want you to do, Energine, 
is to let yourself go — to talk, to 
send, just as if you were writing to 
one of your lonely hearts people. 
Go all the way out, girl. If it 
doesn’t work — only the stars will 
laugh at you.” 

“Oh, I never minded being 
laughed at. It shows that people 
are having fun. I’ll tell him about 
Charley; that’s just to make him 
jealous. You don’t know about 
Charley? Let me read you — well, 
never mind then. This might be the 
first extraterrestrial lonely 
hearts club. 1 could be president.” 
“Yes, you could be president of 
it, Energine. Now, the first live 
blip you get on the scanner, you 
just let yourself go with all you’ve 
got. Send him one of those lonely 
hearts letters. Make it lavender.” 
“Purple. Oh, I will, I will.” 

A nd that evening on the scanner 
■Energine picked up either a mi- 
nor blip or a minor malfunction; it 
was always impossible to tell 
which. Those little egg-shaped 
anomalies — they looked egg- 
shaped, they sounded egg-shaped, 
they broke into egg-shaped sine

curves — were the only evidence 
ever of the sort of target they were 
seeking. Energine let herself go 
on the sender. 

“Dear Albert — since I must call 
you something and I am sure that 
your name is very like that — 1 will 
try quite hard to reach you and I 
beg that you answer me. Your 
name in the Project now becomes 
Albert-(Tentative). To others 
you are only an egg-shaped anom- 
aly, but you are more than that to 
me. 

“This is the first essay to the es- 
tablishment of a stellar lonely 
hearts club and it Just has to be a 
success. In the lonely hearts clubs 
we write in love and affection to 
those we would like to know, and 
we would like to know everyone. 

“I will tell you about our world 
and you tell me about yours. I hope 
that we can get very close togeth- 
er. There is an ecstasy on me 
when 1 can grow very close to an- 
other. 1 believe that the only thing 
of any importance on this world 
is love. Is not that the only thing of 
importance on yours? 

“I had another picture of Char- 
ley today. He is not as handsome a 
man as he was in the first picture 
that he sent. I do not believe that 
the first picture was even a pic- 
ture of Charley. But sometimes 
the first picture that 1 send is not a 
picture of me either. Do you want 
to see a picture of me? I will send 
one as soon as I find out how. 



“I went to a Mexican restaurant 
last night. They had roast kid 
stuffed with almonds and sauced 
all over with burnt brown sugar. 
And they had those little flat pan- 
cake things that taste like card- 
board. I love them. I wonder if 
you enjoy eating as much as I do. 

“Albert, please answer me with 
anything at all and we will begin 
to establish rapport. I feel that 
we could grow very close togeth- 
er. Albert, I will treasure your an- 
swers with those of Fred and Har- 
old and Richard — that one turned 
out badly but he did write nice let- 
ters — and Selby and Roger and 
Norbert. Do you also save old let- 
ters? Answer me. I will stay right 
here till morning and if I do not 
hear from you by then I will wait 
again tomorrow evening and 
every evening. Signed — Energine.” 

S HE waited, but she didn’t have 
to wait as long as she had feared. 
It was only about an hour till the 
response began to come through. 
The first sign of it was the dim- 
ming of the lights and the vibra- 
tion of the building as the auxil- 
iary generators cut in, for the 
translation device seemed to be 
laboring under a heavy, unac- 
customed load. But the machine 
had amazing resources. It could 
translate anything, anything. 

“Energine,” came the answer. 
“That call letter? That name? That 
world? That people? That what?

H e had answered. Albert-(Ten- 
tative) had answered. He had 



understood all of her communi- 
cation except the words. They 
were in perfect rapport. 

The translation device shuddered 
and groaned after the effort. 
Then it panted softly and fell to 
sibilant silence. The building was 
quiet and the night gathered love- 
ly about it. 

fFHE first and most difficult step 
^ of the IDT Project had been 
achieved after twelve years. The 
rest would follow. Others would 
venture where Energine had pio- 
neered. The glad news of the 
achievement was given to the 
world. 

The matter and exact wording of 
the two messages were not, how- 
ever, given to the world. These re- 
mained classified. In the early 
contacts with aliens there are al- 
ways details which will seem in- 
congruous to the unlearned. 

Others tried the feat with some 
success and Energine repeated it 
again and again. The rapport 
grew. Soon Albert Tentative be- 
gan to understand some of the 
words as well as the feeling of the 
messages. Small misunder- 
standings were gradually set 
right, as one from Albert — 

“You ask if we can be sure that 
we are of opposite sex? How not 
opposite? With us are five sexes. 
Everybody partake of several, 
so everybody a little opposite. 
This make for clarity. Surely you

bert Tentative.” 

W1|E IS coming to see me,” said 

^^Energine dreamily. 

“It is possibly a translation er- 
ror,” cautioned Smirnov. “Per- 
haps thpre has been omitted a 
phrase such as: ‘What mean come 
see me?’ You know it would be im- 
possible that he should come. Our 
Block Massive Cultural Trans- 
mission will not be digested by 
them all at once. 1 am pleased at 



the success it has already had.” 

“He is coming to see me,” said 
Energine. 

“No, no, girl. That couldn’t be. 
You are deluded, but 1 can never 
tell you how much I appreciate 
what you have done.” 

“He is coming to see me.” 

“No, he is not. It is completely 
out of the question.” 

He came to see her. 

I T WAS known that he had ar- 
rived, that something had ar- 
rived. Instruments of a dozen 
sorts had recorded him. Albert 
Tentative arrives was the glad 
word, but where was he, what was 
he? He seemed to be invisible and 
inaudible. But for the evidence of 
the instruments there were some 
who would have doubted the arriv- 
al of Albert in the world. 

“1 want a week off,” said Ener- 
gine to Gregory Smirnov. “No, 1 
want a year off. Albert and 1 have 
so much to say to each other that 
we will never get it all said. And 
we’re going to get married if we 
can figure out how to go about it. 1 
really need some private advice 
on that. But look, just look!” 

“A very beautiful and odd ring, 
Energine. Did he give it to you?” 
“Did he give what to me?” 

The ring was a sort of furry me- 
tal. It glowed and it changed col- 
ors. It circled the chubby little fin- 
ger of Energine and she held it up 
to her cheek.

“1 had no idea that anything 
could be so wonderful,” she rap- 
tured. “We’re so happy together. 
We went to the new Syrian Res- 
taurant last night and had camel 
puree. It’s so cute the way he eats 
it.” 

“How, Energine?” 

“Gets right down in the bowl.” 
“Ah — Energine — let’s get to the 
point. Where is Albert Tenta- 
tive? It’s important that we see 
him and examine him. Where is 
he?” 

“Can’t you see him? Why, 1 nev- 
er suspected that. You mean that 
I’m the only one who can see him?” 
“Patience, Patience, thou uni- 
versal regent, do not desert me 
now! What does he look like, En- 
ergine?” 

“Why, he’s round and shining 
and furry, and he changes color.” 
“Energine, the ring he gave 
you — ” 

“Mr. Smirnov, that is no ring. 
That is my Albert. Oh, Albert, he 
thought you were a ring. How fun- 
ny!” 

A lbert tentative was of 

■great interest for about three 
weeks. There was first of all the 
epic press conference that Greg- 
ory Smirnov set up for him as 
soon as the method of plugging 
Albert in and giving him amplifi- 
cation was discovered. It might 
be said that there was first and last 
of all the epic press conference. 



It was a success, let there be no 
doubt of that. It was a total suc- 
cess. There were those who came to 
wonder if the success was not too 
total. 

There was resentment at first 
that foreign correspondents were 
not alerted and given a chance to 
attend it. Some came anyhow to 
see what they could pick up after it 
was over with, and found that it 
was not over with. Albert was still 
talking when they got there; he 
had been talking for a week. 

Albert was a fine talker, now 
that he knew the words. The pid- 
gin of the translation device had 
been that of the device, not of Al- 
bert. He answered all questions 
completely. Oh, how complete- 
ly! He went into spate and an- 
swered questions that had never 
been asked and the newsmen and 
personages listened to him in re- 
lays, fascinated. 

After a week of standing by, En- 
ergine — whose finger Albert had 
long since abandoned for many 
others — said that she thought she 
would go out to get something to 
eat. She looked dazed. She did not 
come back. 

Albert answered the questions of 
the Chinese and the Arabs. He an- 
swered the questions of all the 
newsmen of Earth. He also had a 
Block Massive Cultural Trans- 
mission Corpus which he wanted 
to communicate. He recited the 
Epic Gilmish in which is com-

prised all wisdom. That took him 
thirty hours, perhaps not too long 
a period to be given to a work 
that comprises all wisdom. But 
the listeners were of flesh and 
blood and nobody knew what Al- 
bert was. 

Gregory Smirnov stayed with it 
two weeks and then walked out. He 
shouldn’t have done it as he was the 
host, but there was a weakness in 
the great man that manifested it- 
self here. He went to see the Presi- 
dent of the Republic. 

“Suggest Project’s discontinu- 
ance,’’ he said to the President. 

“But Mr. Smirnov, is not the 
Project a colossal success?” 
“Quite.” ^ 

“You have now established rap- 
port with a completely alien being 
for the first time.” 

“Unfortunately. And perhaps 
not alien enough.” 

“Possibly you yourself are 
burned out by your great labors on 
the project.” 

“Possibly.” 

“1 would be unwilling to aban- 
don the Project now that it has 
proved such an outstanding suc- 
cess. Perhaps we should transfer 
the operation to another group. 
Could you suggest another group 
that might be able to handle it?” 
“Enfield’s Automations.” 

“An excellent suggestion. 
They’re a bunch of comers. We 
will take steps for the transfer of 
authority.” 



“Goodbye,” said Smirnov, and 
left. 

“Did you notice that he seemed 
very short-spoken today?” the 
President asked one of his aides 
when Smirnov had left. 

Albert Tentative was a great suc- 
cess for about three weeks. Then 
the Project was turned over to En- 
field’s Automations, and the 
whole thing went on automatic. 
Albert is still talking. 

I T WAS some time later that 
Gregory Smirnov met Valery 
Mok on the street. 

“Well?” he asked her. 

“1, yes. You, I hope. News?” 

“Of the bunch? Cogsworth dead. 
Shiplap mad. Glasser vanished.” 
“Energine?” 

“Nun.” 

“Which?” 

“Contemplative. Not talk, you 
know.” 

“The address?” 

“Here.” 

“Thanks.” 

Smirnov went to have a glossot- 
omy performed on himself, as well 
as an intricate operation on the 
ears. So they all arranged their 
lives. 

In their final solution they all 
owed much to Albert Tentative. 
For in his recitation of the Epic 
Gilmish he had omitted nothing, 
not even the remarkable five-hour 
speech on the medicinal value of 
silence. ★

I ILIAN BANNISTER pottered 
^around her neat little, bright lit- 
tle sitting room with a yellow little, 
soft little, hemmed-around-the- 
edges dust-absorbent duster. Dab- 
bing and absorbing dust. A busy 
flick of a corner here and a finger- 
tip twirl of a polish there. Keeping 
it tidy. There was nothing like tidi- 
ness. Nothing like dibbing with a 
duster. Intimate. Quite dif^ent 
from hosing around with a vacuum 
like an elephant begging for buns. 
Homely. Lilian Bannister liked a 
home to be homely. Even a trim 
little, prefab little, turned-out- 
by-the-yard little bungalow on 
the edge of the new town crescent, 
aluminum framed windows, a 
door chime that played a bar from 
Blue Bells of Scotland and a 
gnome by the front-garden fish 
tank. It was still home. Modern 
but intimate. Homely. Lonely. 

She sighed. It hadn’t always 
been lonely. Not when she and Sid 
had paid the first deposit, signed all 
the forms and moved in with an 
automatic washer, color television, 
two chairs and a double bed. 
Twenty years ago. Sid had worked 
hard since then. Climbed the pro- 
motion ladder to the very top. At 
least to the top of Sid’s own per- 
sonal ladder. He had become head 
buyer in the meat department. He 
had bought the rest of the furni- 
ture, piece by treasured piece, and 
carpeted the sitting room from wall 
to wall. He had built up the joint 



account, paid his pension con- 
tributions every month, taken out 
sizable life insurance and dropped 
down dead. Everything a good hus- 
band should do, Sid had done. 

She missed Sid. She missed him 
so much that, although it was only 
three in the afternoon and the little 
house was too newly dusted for the 
lived-in look he liked, she switched 
him on. 

“You’re early today,’’ he 
grunted. “Going, out or some- 
thing?” 

She was never sure how they had 
built a time awareness into Sid that 
worked even when he was switched 
off. 

“I wanted to talk to you,” she 
said. 

“Yatter, yatter, yatter,’’ he 
grumbled. “All you ever did was 
yatter.” 

“That’s not kind, Sid!” 

“You switched me on,’’ he 
pointed out. “If you don’t like it, 
you can do the other thing and let 
me get some sleep.” 

There was a control somewhere 
— “Amiability Overide,” the man 
had said. One of the many knobs 
on the front panel was labeled 
“Posterior Unspecific,” needing, if 
she remembered rightly, careful 
coordination with the Social 
Awareness and Group Integra- 
tion Veneer. She was afraid of the 
knobs and the press-buttons and 
the flickering lights and dials, but 
she would have liked Sid’s Poste-

rior Unspecific more specifically 
amiable. Even so, even had she 
dared, it wouldn’t have been the 
same. Wouldn’t have been the 
same Sid. Not if she tinkered. 
They had set him, the man had 
said, as near to his overall pre- 
humous mean as was humanly 
possible, but if she wanted him 
toned up or toned down, she had 
only to consult the manual. “A 
child,” he had said, looking at her 
thoughtfully, “couldn’t fail to un- 
derstand it.” 

She had never understood the 
manual. Activate 10 degrees feed- 
back on the anterior specific regis- 
ter. Mentation level in posterior 
specific should coordinate with 
deep phylogenetic factor on syn- 
drome characteristic equator. If 
paranoiac symptoms develop indi- 
cated by fluctuations above the 
psychocriterion — PRESS RED 
BUTTON IM MEDIA TEL Y. 

It was the psychocriterion that 
worried her the most. She had 
never been sure where to look for it 
nor what it was. 

“It’s no use you brooding over 
them buttons like a Buff Orping- 
ton waiting for chicks,” Sid 
grumbled. “You could never tune 
even the TV without me around to 
do it for you. Touch one of them 
things and most likely you’ll blow 
us both up.” 

“You could tell me how. You’d 
like to be better tempered and 
amiable if I tuned up your un- 



specific cortex, wouldn’t you?” 

“You leave my unspecific cor- 
tex alone. You know as I can’t 
work myself. I don’t know any- 
thing now I didn’t know before 1 
copped it with a coronary and fell 
down the cellar steps. And you 
didn’t have me then — so how can I 
work myself?” 

“Don’t talk about it.” She 
shuddered, referring to his coro- 
nary. 

“Why shouldn’t 1 talk about it? 
It’s not everyone who’s died can 
tell you about it right up to the last 
bump on the head and the last 
thump of the ticker. Dying’s a 
piece of cake, if you know how. I’d 
do it again any time.” 

“Not without 1 press the red but- 
ton,” she told him with a slight 
touch of understandable pride. 
She knew where the red button 
was. It was a button and it was red. 
Knowing that, she had him for the 
first time in their long life together 
completely in her power. 

“Not until I press the red but- 
ton,” she repeated. “And 1 don’t 
do that until you get a psycho- 
criterion. The man said so.” 

He snorted. 

“You wouldn’t know a psycho- 
criterion from a pound of sweet- 
breads.” 

“Yes, 1 would. 1 don’t know 
what it is now but I shall when the 
time comes. It’s like God, you 
don’t know what he is but you 
know what he’s not.” 



THE PHYLOGENETIC FACTOR

“I’m going to sing,” he an- 
nounced. “It’s the only thing I can 
do to shut your yatter about things 
you don’t understand. The only 
thing left 1 can do. No booze, no 
tobacco, no TV, no going to foot- 
ball. All 1 can do is sing.” 

“I like to hear you sing, dear,” 
she told him, settling down in one 
of the float chairs with her knit- 
ting. “I know life’s a bit dull for 
you now, but I do have you all to 
myself.” 

“Hay bag!” he shouted. “Rat 
bag! Want everything your own 
way. Always did.” 

“1 have it my way now, dear.” 
She smiled. “You were a bit ex- 
pensive but with all that insurance, 
I managed. Sing me a nice song, 
love.” 

QlD began to sing. It wasn’t a 
^song she had ever heard him 
sing before, which should have 
been, from what she had under- 
stood from the makers, quite im- 
possible. He could, they had 
warned her, voice unlimited per- 
mutations of his previous sayings, 
could present his store of knowl- 
edge in any way he chose. But he 
could not progress. He could not 
voice a new thing, not based on a 
realignment of the old. And now 
he was singing a new song. She was 
at a loss to understand what had 
happened. The words, of course, 
were only a realignment of words 
he already knew. The notes were 



no doubt a revamping of notes al- 
ready known. But it was not the 
words and the notes that were the 
innovation. It was the idiom. A 
jarring, jungle-based rhythm, rau- 
cous and repulsive. A beat de- 
manding a drumming, a swaying 
and a stamping impossible to a 
middle-aged buyer in a meat de- 
partment, now discarnate and 
wound on tape. 

“Stop it!” she ordered. 

“Go boil your head!” he 
shouted. 

“1 shall switch you off!” 

“No!” he pleaded, suddenly 
apologetic. “Don’t switch me off 
yet. I’m just getting the hang of it. 
Modern, that’s what it is. So 
modern it’s old as time, if you get 
me. 1 was going over it in my mind 
last night and I wanted to give it a 
try.” 

“Last night! But you were 
switched off last night!” 

“Oh — well, yes — likely 1 was. 
But I don’t die off that easy. 
Switched off. I’m what you might 
call disenthralled.” 

“What?” 

“Disenthralled.” 

“You never knew that word be- 
fore! What’s happened to you, 
Sid? You never said a word like 
that before in your life.” 

“Now don’t take on!” he com- 
forted. “Not much difference in 
that from disemboweled and I said 
that often enough in business. 
Disenthralled — yes — 1 like the

sound of it. Disenthralled. Disen- 
franchised. Dispaupered." 

“Dis what?" 

“Dispaupered. You know — like 
you got a ptochocracy and you 
don’t dig it no more.” 

“What — what’s a ptocho- 

cracy?’’ 

“Rule by paupers, of course, you 
pea-brained old bat." 

“There’s something wrong with 
you, Sid. I’ll have to do some- 
thing — it must be the psychocri- 
terion!” 

“Keep your fingers off them 
knobs, you old nannygoat! There’s 
nothing wrong with my psycho- 
criterion and if there was, you 
wouldn’t put it right. Proto- 
saurian, that’s what you are. All 
blubber and no brains.” 

“1 ought to do something, Sid. 
You oughtn’t to know words like 
that and you oughtn’t to have been 
singing like you were. I’ll have to 
put you down and ring for service.” 
“Now, look, Lil, old girl, don’t 
you go on like that. You know 
you’d be lonely as sin without 
me — they take a month with these 
repair jobs. And if you touch that 
red button you kill me stone dead. 
Don’t do that just when I’m being 
creative. Now sit down like a good 
old camel and let me think. 
Promise you won’t switch me off 
for another half-hour — and I 
won’t say another word you don’t 
go for. Now is that a deal?” 

“Okay, Sid,” she said. 



Sid had hardly lapsed into an 
active, dial-flickering silence 
when the doorbell chimed the full 
sequence of Oh where and Oh, 
where has my bonnie lassie gone? 
Embarrassing — she had forgotten 
when she switched Sid on that the 
day was Thursday. Louis Barra- 
way called on Thursdays. Louis 
was very much a man about Step- 
ney, a debonair forty-five, an en- 
trepreneur of numerous enter- 
prises from a barrow in Petticoat 
Lane to a twenty percent stake in 
a Swaffle Club in Shoreditch and a 
twinkling eye cocked for any 
widow with a house of her own and 
all mod. con. 

She always switched Sid off 
when Louis called. 

Well, she thought, as she kicked 
off her slippers and put on her 
opening-the-door house shoes, a 
promise is a promise and it doesn't 
really matter. Sid can’t see him 
and he has no cause to be jealous. 
After all, he has been passed over 
some time now and a part of him at 
least is in the arms of Jesus. It's 
only his voice. Louis is alive and 
respectable — and — well — real. 

She opened the door with a dry 
puckering of her mouth corners. 

Louis greeted her: “How’s me 
favorite old comfy-puffin bird to- 
day then? Give us a kiss, love!” 

“Hush!” she whispered. “Not 
now. And mind what you’re say- 
ing about puffin birds. Sid’s 
switched on.”

“Well — switch him off then.’’ 
“No — I can’t. I promised. Now 
come and sit down and behave 
yourself. It’s only for half an 
hour — but he can be very funny, 
Sid can, if anyone upsets him.’’ 
“Well stone me flippin’ cock 
sparrers! Okay, love, if that’s the 
way you want it. Always wanted 
to see how old Sid works. Can’t see 
me, can he?’’ 

“No — he can’t see you, but you 
watch out. He has very sharp 
ears.’’ 

She gestured him to sit in one of 
the float chairs and left him gently 
rocking while she went to the side- 
board for a bottle of stout. Sid sang 
a few notes, hummed a bar or two 
and experimented with a jungle 
beat by clicking his diaphragm. 
The chink of the glasses brought 
his attention back from his 
subjective world to the goings-on 
in the sitting room. He had counted 
two-chinks. 

“There’s a change in the ambi- 
ance in this bleedin’ menage,” he 
said. 

“You mind your language, Sid. 
We have company.” 

“Company?” he asked. “What 
company? You never told me 
about no company. Who’s there?” 
“It’s me — Louis. How you doing 
in that box, pal?” 

“Louis? What Louis? 1 don’t 
know no Louis.” 

“No, dear, I know you 
don’t — but 1 do. Let me introduce 

124 



you both. Louis Barraway. Louis, 
meet Sid. Sid — Louis.” 



ttp LEASED to meet you, Sid. 

^ Sorry you can’t shake hands. 
Can 1 slap his back, Lil? Or don’t 
he know he’s got one?” 

“What’s he doing here? You 
been carrying on behind my back, 
you exophthalmic old trout? I’m 
not having your fancy men here in 
my house. He can sling his hook 
and get lost.” 

“Now that’s riot nice, Sid. You 
have to understand 1 get lonely 
sometimes. Louis is only a friend. 
No need for you to be upset about 
him.” 

“What you mean — lonely? You 
have me, haven’t you?” 

“But you’re not really there, Sid. 
Louis is.” 

“Of course I’m really here. 
What are you talking about? You 
couldn’t speak to me if I wasn’t 
here, could you?” 

“Now look here, Sid,” Louis put 
in. “You and me have to under- 
stand each other. It’s no use you 
brooding there. 1 came to see Lil 
and there’s nothing you can do 
about it. The difference between 
you and me is — you’re dead and 
I’m not. So — one more peep out of 
you and Lil switches you off, see?” 

“Huh!” 

“And it’s no use you huhhing 
either.” 

“Huh!” Sid snorted. “The 

GALAXY 




parvanimity of the proletariat 
permeates me wick." 

“What's he saying, Lil?" 

“1 don't know. He's started 
saying big words he shouldn't 
know~and singing.” 

.Sid sang. It was a song of such 
wild excesses, complex rhythmic 
ululation, nostalgic far-tundra 
yearning as no mortal ear had 
heard since the australo-pithe- 
cines. And even they had used the 
melody sparingly at bear festivals, 
moon wanings and occasionally for 
an unexpected equinox. It moved 
Lil to stop her ears and Louis to 
stomp in delighted frenzy. 

“Here!" He panted as Sid 
stopped either for ventilation, 
inspiration or to allow his micro- 
circuits to cool. “Keep him at it, 
Lil! Don't switch him off whatever 
you do! I've got me tape-recorder 
in the car.” 

“But you can’t want that 
screeching,” she protested as he 
brought in the recorder and 
plugged it into the two-way adapter 
also supplying the means of life to 
Sid. 

“It’ll be a riot down at the club,” 
he whispered. “There’s money in 
this, me old rockabye Venus. 
Songs my mother taught me — by 
Louis.” 

“But it’s not by you, Louis, it’s 
by Sid.” 

“I can mime, can’t I?” He 
winked. “Let’s get him real mad so 
he’ll sing some more.” 



Y IL didn’t like it and, as the 
^weeks went by, she liked it even 
less. Louis’ picture was in all the 
papers. The club in Shoreditch 
had outgrown its premises and 
moved to a stadium in Hackney 
New Town. Every vocalist in the 
world was trying to latch on to the 
new East London sound, but it was 
no use. The East London sound 
was Louis’ and Louis’ alone. No 
one knew about Sid, locked in his 
box and eking away every residual 
charge in his capacitors in the long 
watches of the night. Com- 
posing- and when Lil switched 
him on for Louis, singing his dia- 
phragm dry. Barely finding a spare 
moment at any time to nag and 
grumble at her in the old familiar 
way. 

Louis seemed quite uncon- 
cerned with the ethics of using her 
Sid for his own dubious ends. Sud- 
den fame had done little to make a 
character she now realized as 
having been only superficially 
plausible, likable in the safe 
taciturn way of Sid. She had al- 
ready decided to put a stop to it 
when fate itself, the father of the. 
gods, took a hand. Louis, a mini 
transmitter concealed behind his 
frilled-lace shirt front, had con- 
sented to broadcast and she had 
accidentally switched on the telly at 
the same time as Sid. She thought 
he would blow a fuse. His emo- 
tional mentation level, had she 
known it, was high above the 



THE PHYLOGENETIC FACTOR 



125 




psychocriterion. Nothing she 
could say would convince him that 
he had not been betrayed and, 
what was worse, that she had be- 
trayed him. 

“You can’t think that,” she 
sobbed. “He did it all himself, 
Louis did. You can’t think I had 
anything to do with it. You al- 
ways trusted me before and you 
can’t believe anything now you 
didn’t believe then. The man said 
so and it says so in the manual, the 
man said.” 

“You forgot the phylogenetic 
characteristic,” Sid retorted. 
“Deep down inside me, 1 have race 
memories, the same as I always 
had. It’s not that I can’t go further 
than the surface me, it’s that 1 
can’t go further than the full sum 
total me, race memories and all. 
The phylogenetic me, if you know 
what I mean.” 

“No.” She sniffed. 

“Where do you think I get my 
songs from, you sniveling old bag- 
gage? I’m much simpler now than 1 
was, however complex 1 look as a 
printed circuit. 1 can dive back 
into my bottom tapes and winkle 
out anything 1 want to, vocals and 
all. Know what that was your fancy 
burk was singing? Morning hymn 
to the Great Spirit, that was. An 
anthem to the all-god, the oldest 
of the old before all your religions 
got started. Right down in my bot- 
tom tapes. I’m back in the bosom 
of the Sun God and neither you nor 



your fancy Louis can get me back 
if I don’t want to come.” 

“But I thought you were with 
Jesus,” she whimpered. “The real 
you, 1 mean. You can’t be anyone 
there, with all those wires and 
lights and things.” 

“Where a man’s voice is, there is 
his heart also — said by Hitabuan, 
all-father of the Yaghan, when a 
man’s voice stayed in its proper 
place as a mouthpiece of his soul. 
And 1 got my soul down here, lined 
up with all the rest of my works.” 

“But you can’t have. Your soul’s 
nothing to do with all those bits 
and bobs in that cabinet. It was 
made in a factory and advertised. 
I paid for it.” 

He grumbled. “Talk about me 
not progressing. You never had 
nothing to progress from. Your 
soul’s not a part of your brain, is it? 
It latches itself on behind. And 
what’s ypur brain but a lot of 
micro-circuits and relays, same as 
this lot I got now? It’s just moved 
over where it could find me and, if 
you want to know, it likes me here. 
Far easier to manipulate this box 
of tricks than me old brain that 
had a lot of redundant animal 
matter clogging its works. Right 
here I’m a saint and a genius and a 
one-man ethnology. A dissemina- 
tor of all the wisdom of the ages. 
And that’s not as much wisdom as 
it ought to be, by a long chalk. So 
you can button your gab and get 
down on your fat porky knees and

show me a bit of respect.” 

“Oh, Sid, please — ” 

“Genuflex, woman!” he shouted. 
“Bend your bulgy buttocks and 
bow down before me!” 

She trembled. “How do you 
know I’m not bowing down?” 
“Because I’m getting to see 
you.” He chortled. “Extra-retinal, 

1 guess they call it. I got a vision of 
you, clear as daylight but a bit 
misty around the edges.” 

She lowered herself unsteadily 
to the floor and kneeled before 
him. 

It was then that Louis came in, 
proprietor fashion, wearing a new 
outfit in the idiom of a nineteenth 
century Dakota cowhand and 
carrying a tape recorder under his 
arm. 

“You got to kneel to Sid,” she 
whispered. “He’s got religion.” 

L OUIS fondled the ends of his 
trailing Mandarin mustache and 
ran the spur of his right boot re- 
flectively up and down the fluted 
deerskin covering of his left tibia. 

“Come off it, Lil. He’s only a 
box of wires. Get up and make him 
mad. Likely he’ll sing for us.” 

“You show Sid a bit of respect!” 
she snapped. 

He smirked. “Okay, if that’s the 
way it is. Anything he wants, he 
gets, me old dolly-lugs.” 

“No one calls me dolly-lugs but 
Sid.” 

“Oh? Aren’t we the old together-' 



now-for-forty-years old Dutch 
today! Anything you say, Lilly 
girl.” 

He went on his knees beside her 
and bowed three times to Sid. 

“Give us a tune, mate. This 
missus of yours is getting water on 
the knees, squatted here.” 

“Stop it, Louis. Sid's not the 
same any more. And take your 
hand off my backside. He can see 
us now.” 

“I don't believe it.” 

“Sid,” she said, tremulously. 
“Louis is here, Sid. And he's kneel- 
ing. Have you anything to say to 
Louis, Sid?” 

“There was a little man, little 
men, all over the ice cap,” Sid said 
and his voice was far away. 
“Trudging through the snow, dy- 
ing of hunger, falling down 
crevasses and never knowing when 
they would come to the end of the 
ice. But they had God in their 
hearts and they took God with 
them all over the world. It didn’t 
matter about the cold and the ice 
and the game dying off wherever 
they went. They had God in their 
hearts in those days. They took 
him. They took him wherever they 
went.” - 

“What’s he on about? Why 
doesn’t he sing to us?” 

“Life was good in those days, 
looking for a cave, looking for 
birch bark to make a tent. Look- 
ing for sticks to rub together to 
make a fire. God was with us then.

We haven't progressed at all." 

"Look, Sid, I'm not kneeling 
down here all day listening to you 
rambling and neither is Lil. I'm 
getting up, see?" 

“It really doesn't matter any 
more." Sid sighed. “Not now that 
I've seen you and Lil and every- 
thing nice and cozy. I've been wan- 
dering about a bit now that my 
soul's not caught in the flux as 
tightly as it used to be. I want to 
go back to where I started. 
Carving a reindeer horn with 
something they call a coup de 
poing. It was just a stone to me. I 
want to latch my soul around my 
bottom tapes and go back over the 
ice cap with God all day, looking 
down in the eye of the winter sun, 
next to someone like Lil in a sea- 
lion cape. And the wind blowing. 
Always blowing, the wind was.” 

Lil scrambled to her feet, re- 
fusing, out of deference to Sid's 
presence, a helping hand from 
Louis. She had never known Sid 
like this before, withdrawn, 
nostalgic, even poetic. It was, she 
knew, without being able to recall 
the exact word, the phylogenetic 
factor in his psyche. She was 
suddenly very much afraid of the 
phylogenetic factor. 

“Sid," she begged. “Don't be 
like that. I'll do anything, really 1 
will. If it's Louis you don't like, he 
can go. 1 never wanted Louis 
really, Sid. It was you I wanted 
back. That's why I spent all the in- 

128 



surance on having you tuned into 
your box. Don't go and leave me 
now, Sid. Thai's what you meant, 
wasn't it?" 

“Don't take on, love," he told 
her. “We all have to go some time. 
Back to the beginning if we’re 
lucky and make a better job of it. 
Just look for the phylogenetic con- 
trol, there's a good girl, and turn it 
down to zero. As soon as you see 
the pointer fall — press the red but- 
ton. I’ll be back where we all ought 
to be back to. Back where the soul 
knew who it belonged to. It started 
to roll away with the wheel and it 
never found its way back until 
they built me. Simplified, you see. 
A lot of the intermediate works left 
out and none of the old animal 
bits. Turn down the knob, there’s a 
good lass.” 

“1 can’t, Sid!" 

“Now you listen here," Louis 
protested. “You’ve upset Lil, talk- 
ing a lot of old codswallop. We 
aren’t primitives any more, thank 
God. We’re civilized. What’s all 
this about ice caps? Who wants ice 
caps? Who wants to go out in the' 
rain without an umbrella? You 
have your snow and ice if you want 
it. We’re all right where we are. 
Automobiles and air condition- 
ing. You just stop this God-in-the- 
wilderness caper and sing us a 
song.” 

“It’s a song you want, is it?” Sid 
asked. 

“Just let me turn on my tape

Sid sang. Not a song with words. 
No longer a wild jungle rhythm, 
evocative of a thousand stamping 
feet, it was a single sad and lonely 
voice crying in an empty wilder- 
ness. Soft at first, rising in a two- 
tone ululation to a frost-ringed 
moon, remote above the endless 
wastes of frozen tundra. Listening. 
Waiting for the moon to answer 
back. 

“What's he doing?” Louis 
whispered. 

“Ululating,” Lil answered, 
knowing that it was so. 

Sid continued to ululate, the 
repetition of his theme demand- 
ing, urging her toward the Syn- 
drome Characteristic Equator. 
To the knob. He was guiding her 
hand to the phylogenetic control 
and nothing she could do would 
hold it back. As she turned the

There was only a faint sighing like

pressed the button and with a long

her hands. 

“Ah, well,” Louis said, “that’s 
the end of that, then. No need to 
take on. Plenty of him on tape to 
last us a while yet.” 

A silence. 

“Hey?” he asked. “You all 
right? You went very quiet all of a

He laid his hand on her shoulder 
and she fell back in the chair, 
rocking gently like a raft on a calm

Sid to find her way across the ice

Sometimes we go up on top of 
the cliffs to play but not often. 
When the tide’s out a hard beach 
grows in front of the Door, miles 
and miles of sand that nobody else 
knows about and wet enough to 
hold a fort together and with kribs 
to catch and all kinds of shells. But 
the cliff is better. There’s grass on 
the cliff. 

All we have to be careful of is if 
the Sets catch us, which they prob- 
ably won’t because they don’t 
much use the cliff road any more. 
And anyway there’s supposed to 
be guards. And we do know what 
to say if they catch us, but 1 won’t 
say it. I don’t intend to waste too 
much time talking, not if a Set 
gets me. 

Birds nest in the grass where the 
trees are, but we aren’t supposed to 
go there. Things can hide in trees. 
Eggs are good, though. 1 used to 
take a lot of them to Mam.

Pap says that pretty soon a man 
won’t be able to live his own life 
like he wants to. He says the meat’s 
getting scarcer. What I guess he 
really means is that the folks are 
getting familier and hungrier, be- 
cause today he brought home a 
fine biggish kill and there was 
nothing left by noon but bones be- 
cause we were darn tired of kribs 
and fishes and we’re almost out of 



winter-pickled. So Pap went 
around the rest of today swinging 
a cleaned legbone, kicking things 
and folks and saying how scrawny 
the meat was and that it was a pity, 
a real pity. That he’d developed a 
liking for that kind of meat during 
the hungry times when most 
everything else died, just because 
he thought there’d always be lots 
of it, and here we were about to 
hunt it down to scrub in two gener- 
ations. Folks stayed out of his way 
mostly. Then Alwin brought in 
one that wasn’t much more than a 
baby, and Pap got even madder 
because he says if we kill off the 
little ones there never will be big 
ones, which makes sense. But San- 
difer says hungry is hungry now, 
the future has to do the best it can, 
and that makes sense tpo. 

Anyway, it was just enough for a 
stew, so we had a kind of picnic at 
the Door in the last sunlight on the 
beach until the tide came in. Then 
our feet started picking up the 
damp out of the sand so we threw 
the scraps for the kribs and stored 
the wood out of the water and 
moved deeper in. 

It rained almost all night. We all 
had to hunt a place to sleep. Our 
room leaks now.

Sets were on the cliffs yester- 
day, lots of them. They’ve never 
hunted there before. Not on the

rained and I’m sure we ean’t play 
up there for a while. I wonder what 
it is brings them out. They don't 
seem to have a regular hunting sea- 
son either. 

While they were up there I went 
down to the hideyhole and looked 
at a couple of books. They’re most- 
ly silly stuff. Even Mam agreed on 
that. Some of the others came 
along and played with the shiny 
junk and dress-up stuff. There ate 
all kinds of things in the books, but 
some of them Pap says are lies'.

We can’t build a cure-fire with 
Them restless, so we had to pickle 
Pap’s good-hunting and that took 
three days. But when it was done 
they let us play on the beach. We 
were supposed to be setting salt- 
pans, and we were, but we were 
playing too. 

Ferin and Eb and Brother stood 
guard on the cliffs, which was silly. 
Sets never hunt the same ground 
twice and they don’t build boats. 
Pap says they ain seawise. He don’t 
build boats either. Doesn’t. Still, 
it’s boats Eb says they’re really 
watching for, since that’s the only 
easy way to get down to the Door, 
but he doesn’t believe in boats 
neither. Sometimes we think Pap 
made them up. He does make 
things up. There’s not really a 
monster in the halls behind the 
smokeroom. If you go there and 
call out, “Hey, old Rawhead- 



bloodybones,’’ nobody comes. I 
knew that a long time before San- 
difier told me. So 1 don’t believe in 
boats, too. Although they might 
work. 

Sellie drowned while we were 
playing on the beach. Afterward I 
sneaked past Brother to watch the 
closest Sets. It’s not dangerous if 
you sneak up on them and Pap 
never said we couldn’t. 

It’s easy. There’s a bush by the 
outmost shelter with leaves all 
thick on the outside and a hollow 
space around its stem and 
branches, like a big empty spore- 
ball great for hiding in. I can see 
everything they do and they sure 
do funny things. They make a lot of 
noise. They don’t seem to have a 
Pap. They live in odd-sized groups, 
not families at all. Some of them 
are just Couples. I don’t know why 
I like to watch them. They have 
some things I want.

My dad found out where I'd 
been, don’t know why I told him. 
He told Pap and they both beat me 
up. They’ll be sorry for that.

I could walk again today, but not 
for long I guess. 1 went back to the 
Sets and took one of the little

its own meat and don’t eat ours.

The little beast caught four var- 
mints today in the smokeroom. 
Some of the folks saw it catch three 
wham, wham, wham. And it 
brought a fourth one to me. Pap is 
very pleased. He told me for an- 
other time why we can’t go near the 
Sets. I know why. They eat us, of 
course. I don’t know why Pap 
bothered with all that stuff about 
slime-molds and hungry times and 
plants dying, unless he’s trying to 
tell me something else. He says if I 
go near the Sets again he’ll take me 
up to the far mountains. So I won’t 
maybe. 

1001 

Brother brought me up a lot of 
books while 1 was so stiff. Funny 
how I understand some things 
about writing and not others. Punc- 
tuation. There’s no sense in it. I 
can understand quotation 
marks. I'hey’re a way of letting 
you see on paper what you can 
really see happening. And peri- 
ods sometimes. But commas are 
silly and so’s spelling. Letters are 
supposed to stand for sounds, but 
they sometimes don't. Like, Pap 



says “ain” which the books add a t 
to, and one of those apostrophes. 
A big word for a little thing. Silly. 
Except when it stands for a letter 
left out, like in don’t. Then it 
means a not-sound. Silly. Those 
books do lots of dumb things. I 
don’t know why 1 like to look at 
them. I don’t know why I like to 
play like this is one I’m writing. 
Even Mam doesn’t really like 
them, except for that one Pap 
burned with her when she died. 
That always seemed real wasteful 
to me. 

1010 

Soon as I could walk again they 
let me go hunting. Nobody liked it 
much but Pap. “Just once,’’ he 
said. “Things get any tougher an 
we’ll have to use em all.’’ So I 
went, but Pol grumbled all the way 
that Pap thought I was special. 
Maybe he does? 

We had to go a long way but I 
didn’t mind. It was beautiful in the 
trees. That light yellow-green was 
everywhere but on the ground and 
the whole world sort of warmed 
and glittered. 1 thought it might be 
too much light and it was, but 
we’re getting on toward winter. 

We’d been hiding just a little 
while when a cluster came along, a 
big bunch, gabbling as usual. May- 
be they figured numbers were safe- 
ty. They weren’t. One of them al- 
most got away, but Eb was on 
westguard and caught him. Then 



THE S.B. NOTATIONS

we carried them out in the clover 
and cut their throats so the meat 
would be sweet. The worst part was 
lugging it home. I got sticky. It's a 
pity we can't bring them home 
alive. 

1 felt funny during and after- 
ward. It was like a star exploded in 
my head. It was like my blood was 
rain and lightning. 1 never felt that 
way before. I guess everybody felt 
pretty good, we got enough to last 
for months. But right in the mid- 
dle of the party Eben and Beke said 
they planned to Couple. They'd al- 
ready found a new room to be 
Couple in and 1 wonder where it 
is. 1 thought for a minute there 
might be trouble because Sandi- 
fer's been with Beke since her 
mother died, but Pap broke it up. 
“Don’t be a damfool," Pap said. 
“Her and Eb’ll get along. How 
many times I got to tell you it’s 
wrong to kill each other? Never 
seems to take.’’ 

So they were quiet. Sets kill their 
kin on smoke-hooks, but we don’t. 
Sandifer took Beke off a while, 
then he shook hands with Eb and 
told Pap he’s waiting around for 
me. He’s joking, I guess. It’d be 
okay if he wasn’t, though. 



Wit 

The little beast is gone. I don’t 
think it went back. It liked me. I 
think Pol killed it. He’ll pay for 
that. 



1100 

We got all the fruit and stuff we 
could from the hillwoods, and Pap 
bought more grain and sugar from 
the Sets, but he can’t buy enough 
so they’ll suspect how many of us 
there are. They tolerate just him. 
He says this’ll be a lean cold win- 
ter. 1 believe him. The grass on the 
cliff is already turning purple and 
the whitetails have gone off to the 
far mountains. 

So we went through the vat- 
rooms and smokerooms and 
picked out the bad bits and threw 
them in the water by the Door. It 
was sad to see so many well-fed 
days go floating off but there’s 
nothing we can do about it. Some 
of it goes bad no matter how much 
salt or stuff you put in it. 1 don’t 
know why. And since my dad got 
hold of that bad piece that killed 
him. Pap’s not taking chances. 

1 asked Sandifer why we didn’t 
go down to the Sets and steal some 
of their food. Pap says we’re bet- 
ter than they are because we sur- 
vived in spite of them, but they sure 
know better ways to keep meat. 
But Sandifer said I couldn’t go, 
so I won’t. 

It doesn’t matter anyway. I 
know the little beast’s not there. 

1101 

They were up there again today 
with their iron things, the things 
I’ve seen them loading the moving 
shelters with but never so close.

They scared me, they don’t look 
real. Even in the back rooms we 
could hear their big hard feet and 
see their shadows sometimes 
through the roof chinks. Then we 
had to go even deeper. They’re very 
heavy, and pieces of the roof fell in. 

They left deep tracks like joined 
worms. Some places the grass was 
just, a pulpy smear and I hadn’t 
thought it had that much juice left. 
I guess if any of us had been up 
there we’d have been smeared, too. 
We were lucky Alwin saw them in 
time for warning, except Pol. 1 
couldn’t find him. Now nobody 
can. We found his cap, though. 

Brother asked Pap today if 1 
wasn’t old enough to Couple, Pap 
said not, but I don’t know. 

1110 

1 know. It’s the meat that brings 
them. Every time we throw out 
scraps the Sets come. Tide must 
take it past their places. 1 tried to 
tell Pap about it, but he’s in no 
mood for listening. I guess he’s 
grieving for Pol. 

1111 

Maybe Pol told them the way to 
the Door. He’s alive. I’ve seen him. 
We fought, but there were lots of 
them and the men were all away. 
Karlie killed one with a vatstick 
and we pushed rocks on some, but 
they had new tools for killing and 
got Karlie and Jann. There was 
very little noise and blood. We 



thought they were ours at first. 
When Beke took the kids into the 
back halls, I think she tried to 
trigger the old rooftraps on the 
Sets. They dug for a long time, 
trying to get to her. So I think all 
those are dead too. And the men, 
of course. 

1 wish some of the men had been 
here when they found the larder. 
We could have got them. They 
were very sick, some couldn’t walk. 
One of them yelled and hurt me 
with one of those new things. Then 
he took a piece of our meat off, 
hugged to his chest. They took 
some bones too out of the waste- 
hole. They were very careful which 
ones they took, like they were 
hunting for special ones. Scaven- 
gers. They didn’t touch my dad’s. 
Then they took all of the shiny stuff 
in the hideyhole. Pap says it’s only 
good to get you hanged, so 1 hope it 
gets them. They made us walk 
down to the settlement ourselves. 
They’ll probably come back for 
the other meat later. They’re either 
not very strong or real lazy. 

I don’t know why they’re doing 
it this way. I guess they’re just Sets, 
not like us, and funny. I think I’m 
scared. 

So they took us to the settle- 
ment and put us into one of the 
moving shelters. It wasn’t here last 
time I was. It seems to be made 
mostly out of metal. I don’t think I 
can get out of it. Anyway, that’s 
where the men were, not dead but

some hurt, and where the one with 
so much hair on him tried to fix my 
shoulder and found the book, this 
book. He took it away from me 
and 1 yelled until he gave it back. 
Then he wouldn’t let me go with 
the others. Said he wanted me a 
little while, and Sandifer got mad. 
So now they’ve put me in this very 
little metal room that doesn’t seem 
to get dark. 1 don’t like it. At least 
he gave the book back. Wish I were 
with the others. 

1 guess the Sets think it will be a 
lean hard winter too. 

10000 

The hairy one is called Doctor 
and talks a lot. After a while I 
could understand him. Mostly he 
asked questions about Pap and the 
others. Silly stuff like who was 
what to who. Whom. Then he 
started giving me things to read so 
he could ask questions about 
them. Sometimes he gives me 
things to do with my hands. Then 
he stands behind a big clear sheet 
of hard stuff and watches me. He’s 
funny. 1 wish they’d let me see Pap 
and the rest. 

They took me outside once. It 
was strange to see trees and all still 
there. It’s hard to believe in trees 
inside that room. And it was 
strange to see the settlement from 
that point. In the middle, not the 
edge. 

Some of us were out there walk- 
ing, too, with lots of Sets around 



them. None of the men. I wanted 
to talk to Tenor and 1 think the 
Crew would have let me, but Doc- 
tor yelled at him not to. When 
Doctor came this afternoon, 1 
wouldn’t talk to him. He didn’t like 
that. 

10001 

I’m not mad at Doctor any 
more. He took me to see Pap, who 
looks real tired and mad and old, 
but mostly tired. Pap told me not 
to tell anything. I Won’t. But they 
wouldn’t take me to see Sandifer. 
Pap hugged me real tight. 1 think 
he cried. The Sets have charge of 
him and the others. Doctor has 
just me. 

Doctor isn’t like the Sets. I don’t 
think he is one. The things he wears 
are different, prettier. Also his 
skin’s a little different color, and 
he speaks Old Solar, which was 
Mam’s language, and the Sets 
don’t speak that. There are some 
others. Crew, who dress like 
Doctor, only with the signs differ- 
ent, and live in this shelter too. 
The Big Guy who came with Doc- 
tor several times is their pap. 

There are Sets all around, 
though, and all of them are mad at 
us. I don’t know why, we didn’t do 
anything to get mad about. But 
they want to put me in with the 
others, and Doctor won’t let them, 
and it makes them all mad. I’ve 
worked a piece of frame around the 
glass loose so I can listen to them

when they’re in the watching- 
room and yesterday was a good 
day for listening. 

“It’s not like this was the only 
case of it in the world,’’ Doctor 
was saying. “There was a family 
in Scotland, the Beanes, 1 think.” 
“How does that change things?” 
asked one of the Sets. 

“It doesn’t* unless it makes them 
a little less horrible.” 

“Murder is a pretty common 
crime,” another of them said. “1 
still find it horrible.” 

“Yes, yes, you’re right. But here 
we have to determine shades and 
degrees of guilt the way we don’t 
have to in most cases. The old man 
now. He talks about the slime- 
mold plagues and the famine all 
the time. He thinks he did what he 
had to. You’ve heard him.” (I like 
quotation marks. And paren- 
theses. Funny 1 can think about 
that now.) 

“Excuses. Some of us survived 
without those measures.” 

“None of the originals did,” 
Doctor reminded them. “Except 
them.” 

That made them mad. “When 
we called your people in we didn’t 
think you’d side with him.” 

“It’s not his side I’m on. Dam- 
mit, that’s the only side I’m not on. 
He knew. Oh, yes, he knew. But 
how can you blame her? She never 
did know. Nobody told her.” 

They tell him that’s what wor- 
ries them, three generations, and he 



waves my book at them. “Read 
this, 1 tell you. Dammit, look at the 
mind that’s here. My business is 
minds. 1 know a marvel when I see 
it. Here’s one that gropes and 
explores, a nearly photographic 
mind. But there are blind spots. 
There are things that no one can 
figure out, things we have to be 
told. And she wasn’t told.” 

Einally he got one of the young 
ones to take the book. 1 was scared 
it was gone for good, but he 
brought it back today and handed 
it to Doctor, and said, okay, he’d 
better read it. Again. Doctor had 
it a long time, but it came back this 
afternoon. A Crew brought it and 
I was sorry because 1 wanted to ask 
Doctor what it was 1 should be 
told. 1 mean 1 know that 1 don’t 
know everything, but people 
won’t answer questions. I will ask 
him. He’s good at questions. 

^But somebody has underlined 
and marked my book all up. 1 bet 
that dam Set did it. 



10010 

I was glad to see Doctor today, 
because it’s been three days since 
the last time. I guess he’s been 
busy. The place has been full of 
Sets, mostly old ones. Their paps, 1 
guess. But I didn’t get to ask Doc- 
tor all the questions I’d thought 
up, because the Big Guy was with 
him and I’m awful scared of the 
Big Guy. 



THE S.B. NOTATIONS

Doctor looked real tired, but he 
said he was okay when I asked him. 
He sat me down and sat down 
facing me and the Big Guy walked 
up and down behind him. “1 have 
some questions, Sarah,” he said. 
“Please answer as carefully as 
possible. Now. You’re not a Set, 
are you?” 1 told him no, of course 
not and he asked, “They’re differ- 
ent from you?” 

“They’re Sets,” 1 told him. 
“See?” he said to the Big Guy, 
who shook his head. 

“Too soft, Charlie. Doctors 
shouldn’t dodge. Ask some of the 
real questions. What happened 
to — ?” 

“I’ll ask,” Doctor said. “You let 
me pick the questions.” 

“Pick ’em then. But bear in mind 
how thin this business is. We were 
an ordinary, grade-one squad in- 
vestigation. We don’t want a plan- 
etwide revolution.” 

“Okay, okay.” 

“And 1 can’t see what difference 
it makes anyhow. That book they 
read part of at the trial shows — ” 
“It makes all the difference.” 
Doctor was talking to him but 
looking at me. 1 don’t know what 
was wrong with his face. “If she 
thought the way I think she did. 
Different species — there’s no mo- 
rality involved.” 

“And the fact that from one 
couple, one renegade couple, you 
get nine grandchildren? Is there no 
morality involved in that?” 



“You’ll blame the children for 
that?” 

“No,” the Big Guy said. He said 
it two or three times. “Ask.” 

“Sarah, exactly how are the Sets 
different?” 

“They live in settlements,” I told 
him. 

“Wait. Think carefully. Is that 
the only way the Sets are different 
from you?” So I told him they did 
different things, lived in the open 
and liked plants and kept beasts 
and married strangers and spoke 
funny and hung meat in the open 
air. He didn’t seem to like any of 
that. The Big Guy stopped walk- 
ing. “Sarah, am I a Set?” the Big 
Guy asked. I said I didn’t think so. 
They looked at each other. Doctor 
said very slowly, “Okay. Let’s say 
we have two of the things that you 
call little beasts, and one of them 
is bigger and has spots, and the 
other has stripes. One of them lives 
in the trees.” 

“Which one?” 

“The spotted one, damn it. The 
other one hates trees 'and never 
goes there. How many different 
kinds of animals do we have now?” 

“One,” I told him. 

And he jumped straight up and 
yelled at me. “Then we’re' the 
same! And the Sets! Sarah, do you 
expect me to eat youT' 

I told him not right then, at least 
I didn’t think so because he liked 
me, I thought, but maybe Pap and 
the rest. Why else did they catch

US? And then I cried very hard. 

1 could hear the Big Guy saying, 
“Charlie, Charlie,” and Doctor af- 
ter a while, “Think about how 
young she is,” and the Big Guy 
saying, “1 am, and about her 
getting older.” And Doctor went 
away, but the Big Guy stayed, not 
talking. Mostly he walked. 1 don’t 
know when he left. I was still 
crying. 

I feel very strange. My eyes hurt. 
I’m not afraid. Why are they do- 
ing this? 

10011 

I think they killed Pap and the 
others. There was lots of yelling. 1 
think they were still mad with us 



and did it very hard, not even with 
the meathooks that 1 saw them use 
before, the ones like upside down 
capital Ls. 

I would have liked to see Sandi- 
fer again. And Pap. My eyes still 
hurt. 

Doctor says they’ll take me out 
of here. I wonder where. He says he 
won’t see me any more, and 1 think 
I’m glad because it makes him un- 
happy. 1 like him. 

But why do I feel so scratched? 
And all my bones feel broken. No 
one’s touched me. I wish I could 
stop crying. 

They’ll be sorry for this. 

There’s no sign of the little beast. 
I won’t write any more. ir 




Lariy Eisenberg, whose latest Duckworth

us as tollows: 

Duckworth is my hero. He’s creative, bold, 
full-blooded and not averse to trying to set a 
bumbling EstabllshmenI on Ihe proper path. 

I have been asked If there is a real life 
model for Duckworth. Actually there are 
several, but one of my dear friends comes 
closest to the Duckworthlan mold. Natural- 
ly he Is unaware of Ihis considerable honor, 
but only because as yet, through some In- 
credible oversight, he hasn’t won his first 
Nobel prize. 

A good part of my work day Is spent at 
Rockefeller University In an ivory tower, 
tussling with Instrumentation problems al 
the Electronics and Computer labs. Often I 
feel sheltered from Ihe real world outside. 
But lately, Inflallon, arms budgets, cut- 



backs in research appropriations, and the 
modern dilemma of scientific responsibility, 
keep slipping into my everyday discus- 
sions. 

I try to hoid on to iaughter. Humor plays its 
part in my work and my family Hie, serving 
as an unequaled buffer against that “stop the

SILVERBERG

He became all the cities of 
Urban Monad 116, a mosaic of 
thousands of minds— less his! 



I 

T hey are playing tonight in 
Rome, in the spishy new sonic 
center on the 530th level of Urban 
Monad 1 16. Dillon Chrimes hasn't 
been that far up in the building in 
weeks. Lately he and the group 
have been doing the grime stint: 
Reykjavik, Prague, Warsaw, the 
working-class levels, down among 
the grubbos. Well, they’re entitled 
to some entertainment too. Dillon 
lives in San Francisco — not so lofty 
himself. That’s the 370th floor, 
only a third of the way up the 
building, the heart of the cultural 
ghetto. But he doesn’t mind that. 
He isn’t deprived of variety. He 
gets around, everywhere from the 
bottom to the top in the course of a 
year, and it’s only a statistical 
anomaly that it’s been nothing but 
bottoms up for a while. The odds 
are he’ll be blowing Shanghai, Chi- 
cago, Edinburgh, that crowd, in the 
month to come. With all those 
clean long-limbed lovelies to visit 
after the show. 

The building is a thousand stor- 
ies high. Divided into twenty-five 
cities of forty floors each, Reykja- 
vik on the bottom, Louisville at the 
top. The current population of 
Urban Monad 116 is something 
above 800,000 people. It’s one of 
51 identical urbmons in the 
Chipitts urban constellation. 
Altogether Chipitts has something 
more than 40 million people. The 

• 



global population, based on the 
2380 census, is 75 billion. Dillon 
doesn’t think much about what 
goes on outside his own urbmon. 
No one does. Every place is more 
or less like every other place. God 
bless, you stay home, get married 
early, have lots of littles, fulfill the 
divine commandment. Be fruitful 
and multiply. Everyone does it. 
We're all a lot happier than we 
were in the old chaotic days. The 
urbmons were a neat solution to 
the people problem. Take one 
hunk of superstressed concrete 
three kilometers high, divide it up 
into enough one-room suites to 
provide homes for 120,000 or more 
family groups, surround it by 
fertile farmland — sure, in a vertical 
civilization like that you could 
double the world’s population 
every five years and still get along. 
With certain minor adaptations 
to circumstances, of course. 

Dillon is seventeen. More than 
middle height, with silken blond 
hair to his shoulders. Traditional, 
the old Orpheus bit. Crystalline 
blue eyes. He loves staring at them 
in a round of polymirrors, seeing 
the icy spheres intersect. Like ev- 
eryone else in the urbmons, he got 
married young. Happily married 
and three littles already, god bless! 
His wife’s name is Electra. She 
paints psychedelic tapestries. 
Sometimes she accompanies him 
when he’s touring with the group, 
but not often. Not now. In all his 



142 



GALAXY 




travels up and down the building he 
has met only one woman who 
delights him nearly as much. A 
Shanghai slicko, wife of some 
Louisville-bound headknocker. 
Mamelon Kluver, her name. The 
other girls of the urbmon are just 
so many slots, Dillon often thinks, 
but Mamelon connects. He has 
never told Electra about her. Jeal- 
ousy sterilizes. 

He plays the vibrastar in a cos- 
mos group. That makes him valu- 
able personnel. Most of the people 
of Urbmon 116 are just breeding 
stock, performing idle jobs to pass 
the time, but he’s an artist. “Tm 
unique, like a flow-sculpture,” he 
sometimes boasts. Actually there’s 
another vibrastar man in the build- 
ing, but to be one out of merely two 
is still a decent accomplishment. 
There are only two cosmos groups 
in Urbmon 116; the building can’t 
really afford much redundancy in 
its entertainers. Dillon doesn’t 
think highly of the rival group, 
though his opinion is based more 
on prejudice than familiarity — he’s 
heard them three times, is ail. 
There’s been talk of getting both 
groups together for an all-out 
headblaster of a joint concert, per- 
haps in Louisville, but no one takes 
such teasers seriously. Meanwhile 
they go their separately programed 
ways_, moving up and down through 
the urbmon as the spiritual weather 
dictates. The usual gig is five nights 
in a city. That allows everybody in. 



say, Bombay, who stones on 
cosmos groups, to see them the 
same week, thereby providing 
conversation-fodder for the 
general sharing. Then they move 
along and, counting nights off, 
they theoretically can make the 
circuit of the whole building every 
six months. But sometimes gigs are 
extended. Do the lower levels need 
excesses of bread and circuses? The 
group may be handed fourteen 
nights running in Warsaw, then. 
Do the upper levels need psychic 
deconstipation in a big way? A 
twelve-night fun in Chicago, 
maybe. Or the group itself may go 
sour and have to get its filters 
reamed, necessitating a layoff of 
two weeks or more. Allowing for 
all these factors, there have to be 
two groups roaming the urbmon if 
every city is going to get a crack at 
a cosmos show at least once a year. 
Right now, Dillon knows, the oth- 
er operation is playing Boston for 
the third week. Some kind of prob- 
lem with sexual turnoffs there, of 
all wildnesses! 

H e wakes at noon. Electra 
loyally beside him; the littles 
long gone to school, except for the 
baby, gurgling in its maintenance 
slot. Artists and performers keep 
their own hours. Her lips touch his. 
A torrent of fiery hair across his 
face. Her hand at his loins, 
wandering. “Love me?” she sings. 
“Love me not? Love me?” 



ALL THE WAY UP, ALL THE WAY DOWN

“You medieval witch.” 

“You look so pretty when you 
sleep. Dill. The long hair. The 
sweet skin. Like a girl, even. You 
bring out the Sappho in me.” 

“Do 1?” He laughs and crams 
his maleness out of sight between 
his lean thighs. Clamps his legs. He 
gouges his palms against his chest, 
trying to push up ersatz breasts. 
“Come on,” he says hoarsely. 
“Here’s your chance — ” 

“Silly. Stop that!” 

“I think Td be very pretty as a 
girl.” 

“Your hips are all wrong,” she 
says and pulls his locked feet apart. 
But there will be no sex between 
them now. He rarely indulges at 
this time of day, with a perfor- 
mance coming up. And in any case 
the mood is wrong, too skittish, 
too brittle. She vaults off the 
sleeping platform and deflates it 
with a kick of the pedal while he is 
still on it. An airy whooshing. 
That sort of mood; presexual, 
childish. He watches her waltz to 
the cleanser. What a fine butt she 
has, he thinks. So pale. So full. The 
splendid deep cleft. The elegant 
dimples. He creeps towards her 
and stoops to nip a hinder cheek, 
carefully, not wanting to leave a 
blemish. They share the cleanser. 
The baby begins to yowl. Dillon 
glances over his shoulder. “God 
bless, god bless, god bless!” he 
sings, beginning basso, ending 
falsetto. What a good life, he 



thinks. How neat existence can be. 
Electra, pulling on her clothes, 
says, “Can I get you some fumes?” 
A transparent band over her 
breasts. Rosy nipples like little 
blind eyes. He is pleased that she 
has stopped nursing; biology is 
tremendously moving, yes, but 
the dribbles of bluish-white milk 
over everything annoyed him. 
Doubtless a failing to eradicate. 
Why be so fastidious? Electra en- 
joyed nursing. Shf still lets the 
little suck, saying it’s for the 
child’s pleasure; but there can 
hardly be much kick in a dry tit, so 
Dillon knows the locus of the joy 
in that particular transaction. 
He hunts for his clothing. 

“Will you paint today?” he asks. 

“Tonight. While you’re perform- 
ing.” 

“You haven’t worked much late- 
ly-” 

“I haven’t felt the strings pull- 
ing.” 

It is her special idiom. To prac- 
tice her art she must feel rooted to 
the earth. Strings rising from the 
planet’s core, entering her body, 
snaking into her and then tugging. 
As the world turns, the imagery is 
wrenched from her blazing dis- 
tended body. Or so she says; Dil- 
lon never questions the claims of a 
fellow artist, especially when she is 
his wife. He admires her accomp- 
lishments. It would have been mad- 
ness to marry another cosmos- 
grouper, although when he was 



144 



GALAXY 




eleven he had just such a thing in 
mind. To share his destinies with 
the comet-harp girl. He’d be a 
widower now if he had. Down the 
chute, down the chute! What a 
flippy filther that one had been. 
And had wrecked a perfectly won- 
derful incantator, too, Peregrun 
Connelly. Could have been me. 
Could have been me. Marry out- 
side your art, boys; avoid unbless- 
worthy invidiousness. 

"No fumar?" Electra asks. She 
has been studying ancient lan- 
guages lately. "Porque?" 

“Working tonight. It spills the 
galactic juices if I indulge this ear- 
ly-” 

“Mind if I?” 

“Suit yourself.” 

She takes a fume, nipping the 
cap neatly with a daggered fore- 
fingernail. Quickly her face flush- 
es, her eyes dilate. A lovable qual- 
ity about her: she is such an easy 
turnon. She puffs vapors at the ba- 
by, who chortles, while the main- 
tenance slot’s field buzzes in a 
solemn attempt to purify the 
child’s atmosphere. "Grazie mille, 
mama!" Electra says, mimicking 
ventriloquy. “£ molto belle! E de- 
licioso! Was fur schones Wetter! 
Quella gioia!" She dances around 
the room, chanting fragments of 
exclamations in strange tongues 
and tumbles, laughing, into the de- 
flated sleeping platform. Her frilly 
frock blows up; he sees an auburn 
pubic glow and is tempted to top 



her despite his resolutions, but he 
regains his austerity and merely 
blows her a kiss. As if perceiving 
the phases of his mental processes, 
she piously closes her thighs and 
covers herself. He switches on the 
screen, selecting the abstract chan- 
nel, and patterns blaze on the wall. 
“I love you,” he tells her. “Can I 
have something to eat?” 

She breakfasts him. Afterward 
she goes out, saying that she is 
scheduled to visit the blessman this 
afternoon. He is privately glad to 
see her go, for just now her vitality 
is too much for him. He must slide 
into the mood of the concert, which 
requires some spartan denials 
from him. Once she has gone he 
programs the terminal for a re- 
verberant oscillation and, as the 
resonant tones march across his 
skull, he slips lightly into the prop- 
er frame of mind. The baby, mean- 
while, remains in its slot, enjoying 
the best of care. He thinks nothing 
of leaving it alone when,' at 1600 
hours, he must go off to Rome to 
set up for the evening’s perfor- 
mance. 

T he liftshaft shoots him a hun- 
dred sixty levels heavenward. 
When he gets off, he is in Rome. 
Crowded halls, tight faces. The 
people here are mostly minor bu- 
reaucrats, a middle echelon of 
failed functionaries, those who 
would never get to Louisville ex- 
cept to deliver a report. They are 



ALL THE WAY UP, ALL THE WAY DOWN 



145 




not even smart enough to hope for 
Chicago or Shanghai or Edin- 
burgh. Here they will stay in this 
good gray city, frozen in hallowed 
stasis, doing dehumanized jobs that 
any computer could handle forty 
times as well. Dillon feels a cosmic 
pity for everyone who is not an 
artist, but he pities the people of 
Rome most of all, sometimes. 
Because they are nothing. Because 
they can use neither their brains 
nor their muscles. Crippled souls; 
walking zeros; better off down the 
chute. A Roman slams right into 
him as he stands outside the 
liftshaft bank, considering these 
things. Male, maybe forty, all the 
spirit drained from his eyes. The 
walking dead. The running dead. 
“Sorry,” the man mumbles and 
speeds on. “Truth!” Dillon cries 
after him. “Love! Loosen up! Top 
a lot!” He laughs. But what good 
does it do; the Roman will not 
laugh with him. Others of his kind 
come rushing down the corridor, 
their leaden bodies absorbing the 
last vibrations of Dillon’s ex- 
clamations. “Truth! Love!” 
Blurred sounds, fading, graying, 
going. Gone. / will entertain you 
tonight, he tells them silently. I will 
drive you out of your wretched 
minds and you will love me for it. 
If I could only burn your brains! If 
I could only singe your souls! 

He thinks of Orpheus. They 
would tear me apart, he realizes, if 
I ever really reached them. 



He saunters toward the sonic 
center. 

Pausing by the elbow-bend of the 
corridor, still halfway around the 
building from the auditorium, 
Dillon feels a sudden ecstatic 
awareness of the splendor of the 
urbmon. A frenzied epiphany; he 
sees it as a spike suspended be- 
tween heaven and earth. And he is 
almost at the midway point right 
now, with a little more than five 
hundred floors over his head, a lit- 
tle less than five hundred floors 
under his feet. People moving 
around, copulating, eating, giving 
birth, doing a million blessworthy 
things, each one out of 800-how- 
many-thousand traveling in his 
own orbit. Dillon loves the build- 
ing. Right now he feels he could 
almost soar on its multiplicity the 
way others might soar on a drug. 
To be at the equator, to drink the 
divine equilibrium — oh, yes, yes! 
But of course there is a way to ex- 
perience the whole complexity of 
the urbmon in one wild rush of in- 
formation. He has never tried it; he 
is not really heavy on groovers and 
has stayed away from the more 
elaborate drugs, the ones that open 
your mind so wide that anything 
can wander in. Nevertheless, here 
in the middle of the urbmon, he 
knows that this is the night to try 
the multiplexer. After the 
performance. To pop the pill that 
will allow him to drop the mental 
barriers, to let the full immensity 



146 



GALAXY 




of Urban Monad 116 in- 
terpenetrate his consciousness. 
Yes. He will go to the 500th floor 
to do it. If the performance goes 
well. Nightwalking in Bombay. He 
really should turn on in the city 
where tonight’s concert will be 
held, but Rome goes no farther 
down than the 521st floor and he 
must go to the 500th. For the mys- 
tic symmetry of the thing. Even 
though it is still inexact. Where is 
the true midpoint in a building of a 
thousand floors? Somewhere be- 
tween 499 and 500, no? But the 
500th floor will have to do. We 
learn to live with approximations. 

He enters the sonic center. 

A fine new auditorium, three 
stories high, with a toadstool of a 
stage in the center and audience 
webs strung concentrically around 
it. Lightglow drifts in the air. The 
mouths of speakers, set into the 
domed rich-textured ceilings, puck- 
er and gape. A warm room, a good 
room, placed here by the divine 
mercy of Louisville to bring a little 
joy into the lives of these bleak 
juiceless Romans. There is no 
better hall for a cosmos group in 
the entire urbmon. The other 
members of the group are here al- 
ready, tuning in. The comet-harp, 
the incantator, the orbital diver, 
the gravity-drinker, the doppler-in- 
verter, the spectrum-rider. Already 
the room trembles with shimmer- 
ing plinks of sound and jolly blurts 
of color, and a shaft of pure no- 



referent texture, abstract and im- 
manent, is rising from the doppler- 
inverter’s central cone. Everyone 
waves to him. “Late, man,” they 
say, and, “Where you been?” and, 
“We thought you were skimming 
out,” and he says, “I’ve been in the 
halls, peddling love to the Ro- 
mans,” which shatters ihem into 
strands of screeching laughter. He 
clambers onto the stage. 

II 

H IS instrument sits untended 
near the perimeter, its lattices 
dangling, its lovely gaudy skin un- 
illuminated. A lifting machine 
stands by, waiting to help him put 
it in its proper place. The machine 
brought the vibrastar to the audi- 
torium; it would also tune it in for 
him, if he asked it to, but of course 
he will not do that. Musicians have 
a mystique about tuning in their 
own instruments. Even though it 
will take him at least two hours to 
do it and the machihe could do it in 
ten minutes. Maintenance workers 
and other humbles of the grubbo 
class have the same mystique. Not 
strange; one must battle con- 
stantly against one’s own obsole- 
sence, if one is going to go on 
thinking of oneself as having a 
purpose in life. 

“Over here,” Dillon tells the 
machine. 

Delicately it brings his vibrastar 
to the output node and makes the

147 




connection. Dillon could not pos- 
sibly have moved the immense in- 
strument. He does not mind let- 
ting machines do the things hu- 
mans were never meant to do, like 
lifting three-ton loads. Dillon puts 
his hands on the mahipulatrix and 
feels the power thrumming through 
the keyboard. Good. “Go,” he tells 
the machine, and silently it slides 
away. He kneads and squeezes the 
projectrons of the manipulatrix. As 
if milking them. Sensual pleasure 
in making contact with the 
machine. A little orgasm with 
every crescendo. Yeah. Yeah. 
Yeah. 

“Tuning in!” he warns the other 
musicians. 

They make feedback adjust- 
ments in their own instruments; 
otherwise the sudden surge of his 
entrance might damage both in- 
struments and players. One by one 
they nod their readiness to him, the 
gravity-drinker lad chiming in last, 
and finally Dillon can let out the 
clutch. Yeah! The hall fills with 
light. Stars stream from the walls. 
He coats the ceiling with dripping 
nebulae. He is the basic instrument 
of the group, the all-important 
continuo, providing the foundation 
against which the others will do 
their things. With a practiced eye 
he checks the focus. Everything 
sharp. Nat the spectrum-rider 
says, “Mars is a little off-color. 
Dill.” Dillon hunts for Mars. Yes. 
Yes. He feeds it an extra jolt of 



orange. And Jupiter? A shining 
globe of white fire. Venus. Saturn. 
And all the stars. He is satisfied 
with the visuals. 

“Bringing up the sound, now,” 
he says. 

The heels of his hands hit the 
control panel. From the gaping 
speakers comes a tender blade of 
white noise. The music of the 
spheres. He colors it now, bring- 
ing up the gain on the galactic side, 
letting the stellar drift impart 
plangent hues to the tone. Then, 
with a quick downward stab on the 
projectrons, he kicks in the plane- 
tary sounds. Saturn whirls like a 
belt of knives. Jupiter booms. “Are 
you getting it?” he calls out. 
“How’s the clarity?” Sophro the 
orbital diver says, “Fat up the as- 
teroids, Dill,” and he does it, and 
Sophro nods, happy, his chins 
trembling in pleasure. 

After half an hour of prelimin- 
ary maneuvers Dillon has his pri- 
mary tuning finished. So far, 
though, he has done only the solo 
work. Now to coordinate with the 
others. Slow, delicate work: to 
reach reciprocity with them one by 
one, building a web of interrela- 
tionship, a seven-way union. 
Plagued all the way by heisenberg- 
ing effects, so that a whole new 
cluster of adjustments has to be 
made each time another instru- 
ment is added to the set. Change 
one factor, you change everything; 
you can’t just hold your own while 



148 



GALAXY 




keying in more and more and more 
output. He takes on the spectrum- 
rider first. Easy. Dillon gives forth 
a shower of comets and Nat 
modulates them pleasantly into 
suns. Then they add the incanta- 
tor. A slight stridency at first, 
quickly corrected. Good going. 
Then the gravity-drinker. No prob- 
lem. The comet-harp, now. Rasp! 
Rasp! The receptors go bleary and 
the entire thing falls apart. He and 
the incantator have to retune sep- 
arately, rejoin, bring the comet- 
harp into the net again. This time 
all right. Great plummy curves of 
tone go lalloping through the hall. 
Then the orbital diver. Fifteen 
sweaty minutes; the balances keep 
souring. Dillon expects a system 
collapse any second, but no, they 
hang on and finally get the levels 
even. And now the really tough 
one, the doppler-inverter, which 
threatens always to clash with his 
own instrument because both rely 
as much as visuals as audio, and 
both are generators, not just mod- 
ulators of someone else’s playing. 
He almost gets it. But they lose the 
comet-harp. It makes a thin edgy 
whining sound and drops out. So 
they go back two steps and try 
again. Precarious balance, con- 
stantly falling off. Up till five years 
ago, there had been only four 
instruments in cosmos groups; it 
was simply too difficult to hold 
more than that together. Like add- 
ing a fourth actor in Greek trag- 



edy: an impossible technical feat, 
or so it must have seemed to Aes- 
chylus. Now they were able to co- 
ordinate six instruments reason- 
ably well, and a seventh with some 
effort, by sending the circuit 
bouncing up to a computer nexus 
in Edinburgh, but it is still a filther 
to put them all in synch. Dillon 
gestures madly with his left shoul- 
der, encouraging the doppler-in- 
verter to get with it. “Come on, 
come on, come on, come onl” and 
this time they make it. The time is 
1840. Everything sticks together. 

“Let’s run it through, now,” Nat 
sings out. “Give us an A for tuning, 
maestro.” 

D illon hunches forward and 
clutches the projectrons. Feeds 
power. Gets a sensory shift; the 
knobs abruptly feel like the cheeks 
of Electra’s buttocks in his hands. 
Smiles at the sensation. Firm, 
bouncy, cool. Up we go! And gives 
them the universe in one sizzling 
blare of light and sound. The hall 
swims with i/nages. The stars leap 
and cross and mate. The incanta- 
tor man picks up his sonics and 
does his trick, enhancing, multi- 
plying, intensifying, until the whole 
urbmon shakes. The comet-harp 
makes bleeping blurting loops of 
dizzying counterpoint and starts to 
rearrange Dillon’s constellations. 
The orbital diver, hanging back, 
makes a sudden plunge at an un- 
expected moment, and dials spin 



ALL THE WAY UP, ALL THE WAY DOWN 



149 




on everybody’s control panel, but it 
is such a devastating entry that 
Dillon inwardly applauds it. The 
gravity-drinker smoothly sucks 
tone. Now the doppler-inverter 
goes at it, shooting up its own shaft 
of light, which sizzles and steams 
for perhaps thirty seconds before 
the spectrum-rider grabs it and 
runs with it, and now all seven of 
them are jamming madly, each 
trying to put the others on, shoot- 
ing forth such a welter of signals 
that the sight must surely be visi- 
ble from Boswash to Sansan. 

“Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!” Nat 
screams. “Don’t waste it! Man, 
don't waste it!" 

And they cut out of phase and go 
down and sit there idling, sweaty, 
nerves twinkling. Withdrawal 
pain; it hurts to step away from 
such beauty. But Nat is right: they 
mustn’t use themselves up before 
the audience gets here. 

Dinner break, right on stage. No 
one eats much. They leave the in- 
struments tuned and running, of 
course. Lunacy to disrupt the synch 
after working so hard to get it 
right. Now and then one of the 
idling instruments flares past its 
threshold and emits a blob of light 
or a squeak of sound. They'd play 
themselves if we'd only let them, 
Dillon thinks. It might just be a 
wild soar to turn everything on and 
sit back, doing nothing, while the 
instruments themselves gave the 
concert, self-programed. You’d get 



some strange percepts then. The 
mind of the machine. On the other 
hand it might be a hell of a dropper 
to find out you were superfluous. 
How frail is our prestige. 
Celebrated artists today, but let the 
secret sneak out and we’ll all be 
pushing junk buckets in Reykjavik 
tomorrow. 

The audience begins to show up 
at 1945. An older crowd; since this 
is the first night of the Rome run, 
the rules of seniority have gov- 
erned the distribution of tickets 
and the under-20s have been left 
out. Dillon, midstage, does not 
trouble to hide his scorn for the 
gray, baggy people settling into the 
audience webs all around him. Will 
the music reach them? Can 
anything reach them? Or will they 
sit passively, not even going half- 
way out to the performance? 
Dreaming of making more littles. 
Ignoring the sweating artists; tak- 
ing up a good seat and getting 
nothing from the fireworks about 
them. We throw you the whole 
universe and you don't catch. Is it 
because you're old? How much can 
a plumpish many-mother, 33 years 
old, pull from a cosmos show? No, 
it isn’t age. In the more 
sophisticated cities there’s no prob- 
lem of audience response, young or 
old. No, it’s a matter of your basic 
attitude toward the world of art. At 
the bottom of the building, the 
grubbos respond with their eyes, 
their guts, their balls. Either 



150 



GALAXY 




they’re fascinated by the colored 
lights and the wild sounds, or else 
they’re baffled and hostile, but they 
aren’t indifferent. In the top levels, 
where the use of the mind is not 
only permitted but desired, they 
reach out for the show, knowing 
that the more they bring to it, the 
more they get from it. And isn’t 
that what life is all about, to wring 
all the sensory percepts you can out 
of the outputs drifting past your 
head? What else is there? But here, 
here in the middle levels, all the 
responses are dulled. The walking 
dead. The important thing is being 
present in the auditorium, grabbing 
that ticket away from someone 
else, showing off. The performance 
itself doesn’t matter. That’s just 
noise and light, some crazy kids 
from San Francisco having a 
workout. So there they sit, these 
Romans, disconnected from skull 
to crotch. What a joke. Romans? 
The real Rome wasn’t like that, 
you bet. Calling their city Rome is 
a crime against history. Dillon 
glares at them. Then, overfocusing 
his eyes, he deliberately blurs 
them out; he does not want to see 
their flabby gray faces, for fear the 
sight of them will color his 
performance. He is here to give. If 
they can’t take, tough. 

“Let’s go up now,’’ Nat mur- 
murs. “Ready, Dill?” 

H e is ready. He brings his hands 
up for a virtuoso pounce and 



slams them down on the projec- 
trons. The old headblaster! Moon 
and sun and planets and stars come 
roaring out of his instrument. The 
whole glittering universe erupts in 
the hall. He doesn’t dare look at 
the audience. Did he rock them? 
Are they gasping and tugging at 
their droopy lower lips? Come on, 
come on, come on! The others, as if 
sensing that he’s into something 
special, let him take an 
introductory solo. Furies fly 
through his brain. He jabs the ma- 
nipulatrix. Pluto! Saturn! Betel- 
geuse! Deneb! Here sit people who 
spend their whole lives locked in- 
side a single building; give them the 
stars in one skullblowing rush. 
Who says you can’t start with your 
climax? The power drain must be 
immense; lights must be dimming 
all the way to Chicago. What of it? 
Did Beethoven give a damn about 
the power drain? There. There. 
There. Throw stars around. Make 
them shimmer and shake. An 
eclipse of the si^n — why not? Let 
the corona crackle and fry. Make 
the moon dance. And bring up the 
sound, too, a great heaving pedal- 
point that sneaks up the webbing 
at them, a spear of 50-cycle vibra- 
tion nailing their guts. Help them 
digest their dinner. Shake up all 
the old waste clogging the colon. 
Dillon laughs. He wishes he could 
see his face now; something de- 
monic, maybe. How long is the 
solo going to last? Why don’t they 



ALL THE WAY UP, ALL THE WAY DOWN 



151 




pick up on him, now? He’s going 
to burn out. He doesn’t mind, 
throwing himself into the machine 
like that, except for the faint para- 
noid feeling that the others are de- 
liberately allowing him to strain 
past his limits so he’ll injure him- 
self. The rest of his life sitting like 
a slug, going booble-booble-boo- 
ble. Not me! He pulls out all the 
stops. Fantastic! He’s never done 
things like this before. It must be 
his rage at these dull Romans that 
is inspiring him. And all of it 
wasted on them. Slot that, though: 
what counts is what’s happening in- 
side him, his own artistic fulfill- 
ment. If he can blow their skulls, 
that’s a bonus. But this is ecstasy. 
The whole universe is vibrating 
around him. A gigantic solo. God 
himself must have felt this way 
when he got to work on the first 
day. Needles of sound descending 
from the speakers. A mighty cre- 
scendo of light and tone. He feels 
the power surging through himself; 
he is so happy with what he is do- 
ing that he grows hard below, and 
tips himself back in his seat. Has 
anyone ever done something like 
this before, this improvised sym- 
phony for solo vibrastar? Hello, 
Bach! Hello, Mick! Hello, Wag- 
ner! Shoot your skulls! Let it all 
fly! He is past the crest, starting to 
come down now, no longer relying 
on raw energy but dabbling in 
subtler things, splashing Jupiter 
with golden splotches, turning the 



stars into icy white points, bring- 
ing up little noodling ostinati. He 
makes Saturn trill: a signal to the 
others. Who ever heard of opening 
a concert with a cadenza? But they 
pick up on it. 

Ah, now. Here they come. Gent- 
ly the doppler-inverter noodles in 
with a theme of its own, catching 
something of the descending fer- 
vor of Dillon’s stellar patterns. At 
once the comet-harp overlays this 
with a more sensational series of 
twanging tones that immediately 
transmute themselves into looping 
blares of green light. These are 
seized by the spectrum-rider, who 
climbs up on top of them and, 
grinning broadly, skis off toward 
the ultra-violet in a shower of his- 
sing crispness. Old Sophro now 
does his orbital dives, a swoop and 
a pickup followed by a swoop and a 
pickup again, playing against the 
spectrum-rider in the kind of cun- 
ning way that only someone right 
inside the meshing group can ap- 
preciate. Then the incantator en- 
ters, portentous, booming, sending 
reverberations shivering through 
the walls, heightening the signifi- 
cance of the tonal and astronomi- 
cal patterns until the convergences 
become almost unbearably beauti- 
ful. It is the cue for the gravity- 
drinker, who disrupts everybody’s 
stability with wonderful wild liber- 
ating bursts of force. By this time 
Dillon has retreated to his proper 
place as the coordinator and uni- 



152 



GALAXY 




Tier of the group, tossing a skein of 
melody to this one, a loop of light 
to that one, embellishing ev- 
erything that parses near him. He 
fades into the undertones. His 
manic excitement passes; playing 
in a purely mechanical way, he is as 
much listener as performer, quietly 
appreciating the variations and 
divagations his partners are 
producing. He does not need to 
draw attention now. He can simply 
go oomp oomp oomp the rest of 
the night. Not that he will; the con- 
struct will tumble if he doesn't feed 
new data every ten or fifteen min- 
utes. But this is his time to coast. 

Each of the others takes a solo in 
turn. Dillon can no longer see the 
audience. He rocks, he pivots, he 
sweats, he sobs; he caresses the 
projectrons furiously; he seals him- 
self in a cocoon of blazing light; he 
juggles alternations of light and 
darkness. The rod in his pants has 
softened. He is calm at the eye of 
the storip, fully professional, 
quietly doing his work. That 
moment of ecstasy seems to belong 
to some other day, even to some 
other man. How long had the solo 
lasted, anyway? He has lost track 
of the time. But the performance 
is going well, and he leaves it to 
methodical Nat to keep watch of 
the hour. 

A fter its frenzied opening the 
concert has settled into routine. 
The center of the action has shifted 



to the doppler-inverter man, who is 
spinning off a series of formula 
flashes. Quite nice, but stale stuff, 
over-rehearsed, unspontaneous. 
His offhandedness infects the oth- 
ers and the whole group vamps for 
perhaps twenty minutes, going 
through a set of changes that numb 
the ganglia and abort the soul, until 
finally Nat spectacularly shrieks 
through the whole spectrum from 
someplace south of infrared into 
what, for anyone can tell, may be 
the X-ray frequencies, and this wild 
takeoff not only stimulates a 
rebirth of inventiveness but also 
signals the end of the show. 
Everybody picks up on him and 
they blast free, swirling and 
floating and coming together, 
forming one entity with seven

data-stoned audience with moun- 
tains of overload. Yes yes yes yes 
yes. Wow wow wow wow wow. 
Flash flash flash flash flash. Oh oh 
oh oh oh. Come come come come 
come. Dillon is at the heart of it, 
tossing off bright purple sparks, 
pulling down suns and chewirrg 
them up, and he feels even more 
plugged in than during his big solo, 
for this is a joint thing, a blending, 
a merging, and he knows that what 
he is feeling now explains 
everything: this is the purpose of 
life, this is the reason for it all. To 
tune in on beauty, to plunge right 
to the hot source of creation, to 
open your soul and let it all in and

and it ends. Pull the plug. They 
let him have the final chord and he 
cuts off a skullblower, a five-way 
planetary conjunction and a triple 
fugue, the whole showoff burst last- 
ing no more than ten seconds. Then 
down with the hands and off with 
the switch and a wall of silence 
rises ninety kilometers high. This 
time he’s done it. He’s emptied 
everybody’s skull. He sits there 
shivering, biting his lip, dazed by 
the house-lights, wanting to cry. 
He dares not look at the others in 
the group. How much time is pass- 
ing? Five minutes, five months, five 
centuries, five megayears? And at 
last the reaction. A stampede of 
applause. All of Rome on its feet, 
yelling, slapping cheeks — the ulti- 
mate tribute, four thousand people 
struggling out of their comfortable 
webs to pound their palms against 
their faces — and Dillon laughs, 
throwing back his head, getting up 
himself, bowing, holding his hands 
out to Nat, to Sophro, to all six of 
them. Somehow it was better 
tonight. Even these Romans know 
it. What did they do to deserve it? 
By being such lumps, Dillon tells 
himself, they drew forth the best we 
had in us. To turn them on. And we 
did. We knocked them out of their 
miserable soggy skulls. 

The cheering continues. 



Fine. Fine. We are great artists. 
Now I’ve got to get out of here, 
before 1 come down from it all. 

HI 

H e never socializes with the 
rest of the group after a per- 
formance. They have all discov- 
ered that the less they see of each 
other in leisure hours, the more 
intimate their professional collab- 
oration will be; there is no intra- 
group friendship,' not even intra- 
group sex. They all feel that would 
be death, any kind of coupling, 
hetero, homo, triple-up — save that 
for outsiders. They have their mu- 
sic to unite them. So he goes off by 
himself. The audience starts to flow 
toward the exits and, without 
saying good night to anybody, Dill- 
on steps into the artists’ trapdoor 
and makes his escape one level 
down. His clothes are stiff and wet 
with perspiration, clammy, un- 
comfortable. He must do some- 
thing about that quickly. Prowling 
along the 529th floor for a drop- 
shaft, he opens the first apartment 
door he comes to and finds a cou- 
ple, sixteen, seventeen years old, 
squatting before the screen. He 
naked, she wearing only breast- 
coils, both of them plainly soaring 
on one of the harder ones, but not 
so high that they can’t recognize 
him. “Dillon Chrimes!” the girl 
gasps, her squeal waking two or 
three littles.

“Hey, hello,” he says. "1 jusl 
have to use the cleanser, okay? 
Don't let me disturb you. I don’t 
even want to talk, you know? I'm 
still way up.” He strips off his sod- 
den clothes and gets under the 
cleanser. It hums and rumbles and 
peels his grime from him. He lets it 
work on his clothes next. The girl is 
creeping toward him. She has the 
breastcoils off; the white imprints 
of the metal on her pink dangling 
flesh are turning rapidly red. 
Kneeling before him. Hand goes to 
his thighs. “No,” he says. “Don't.” 

“But why?” 

“Just wanted to use the clean- 
ser. Couldn’t stand my own stink. 
I’ve got to do my nightwalking on 
500 tonight.” Her fingers sliding 
between his legs. Gently he pries 
them. Back into his clothing; the 
girl looks on, astonished, as he cov- 
ers himself. 

“You aren't going to?” she asks. 

“Not here. Not here.” She con- 
tinues to blink at him as he goes 
out. Her look of shock saddens 
him. Tonight he must go to the 
middle of the building, but tomor- 
row, for sure, he will come to her, 
and he’ll explain everything then. 
He makes a note of the room num- 
ber. 52908. Nightwalking is sup- 
posed to be random, but to hell 
with that; he owes her a thrill. To- 
morrow. 

In the hall he finds a groover 
dispenser and requisitions his pill, 
tapping his metabolic coefficient 



out on the console. He orders a 
multiplexer, said to be one of the 
most profound trips available. His 
first attempt with it. The machine 
performs the necessary calcula- 
tions and delivers a five-hour dose, 
timed to go off in twelve minutes, 
according to the yellow wrapper. 
Printed in bold black letters on the 
wrapper is: CAUTION! THIS

shrugs. It’ll be all right; he’s no

briefly make him one. He 
swallows it and steps into the drop- 
shaft.

A S CLOSE to halfway as he can 
get. A metaphysical fancy, but 
why not? He has not lost the ca- 
pacity to play games. We artists 
remain happy because we remain 
as children. Eleven minqtes to his 
high. He goes down the corridor, 
opening doors. In the first room he 
finds a man, a woman, another 
man. “Sorry,” he calls. In the sec- 
ond room three girls. Momentar- 
ily tempting, but only momentar- 
ily. Anyway, they look fully busied 
with each other. “Sorry, sorry, 
sorry.” In the third room a mid- 
dle-aged couple; they give him a 
hopeful stare, but he backs out. 
Fourth time lucky. A dark-

haired girl, alone, pouting a little. 
Obviously her husband is out 
nightwalking and no one has come 
to her, a statistical fluke that dis- 
tresses her. Early twenties, Dillon 
guesses, with fine tapering nose, 
glossy eyes, elegant breasts, olive 
skin. The flesh over her eyelids is 
puffy, which may become a flaw of 
appearance ten years from now but 
which gives her a sultry, sensual 
look at the moment. She has been 
brooding for hours, he guesses, 
because her sullenness does not 
evaporate until he has actually 
been in the room fifteen seconds or 
so; she is slow to realize that she is 
being nightwalked with. “Hello,” 
he says. “Smile? Won't you smile a 
little?” 

“I know you. The cosmos 
group?” 

“Dillon Chrimes, yes. On the vi- 
brastar. We’re playing Rome to- 
night.” 

“Playing Rome and nightwalk- 
ing Bombay?” 

“What the hell. I have philo- 
sophical reasons. To be in the mid- 
dle of the building, you know? Or 
as close as 1 can come. Don’t ask 
me to explain.” He looks around 
the room. Six littles. One of them, 
awake, is at least nine years old, a 
skinny girl with her mother’s olive 
skin. Mother isn’t as young as she 
looks, then. At least twenty-five, 
maybe. Dillon doesn’t mind. In a 
little while he’ll be groping the 
whole urbmon, anyway, all ages. 



sexes, shapes. He says, “I have to 
tell you about my trip. I’m on a 
multiplexer. It’ll hit me in six min- 
utes.” 

She puts her hand to her lips. 
“We don’t have much time, then. 
You ought to be with me before 
you go up.” 

“Is that the way they work?” 

“Don’t you know?” 

“I’ve never gone that way be- 
fore,” he confesses. “Never got 
around to it.” 

“Neither have I. I didn’t think 
anybody actually did take multi- 
plexers, really. But I’ve heard of 
what you’re supposed to do.” She 
is disrobing as she talks. Heavy 
breasts, big dark circles around the 
nipples. Her legs strangely thin; 
when she stands straight the insides 
of her, thighs are far apart. There is 
a folkmyth of some sort about girls 
built that way, but Dillon cannot 
remember it. He drops his clothes. 
The drug has started to get to him, 
several minutes ahead of 
schedule — the walls are shimmer- 
ing, the lights look fuzzy. Odd. Un- 
less the fact that he was already 
way up from performing should 
have been calculated into the dos- 
age request. The metabolism 
turned to high, maybe, on noth- 
ing but sound and light. Well, no 
harm done. He moves toward the 
sleeping platform. “What’s your 
name?” he asks. 

“Alma Clune.” 

“I like the sound of that. Al-

ma." She lakes him into her arms. 
This will not be an extraordinary 
erotic experience for her, he fears. 
Once the multiplexer takes hold, he 
doubts that he can concentrate 
properly on her needs — and in any 
case the time element has made it 
necessary to skip all preliminaries. 
But she seems to be understanding. 
She will not spoil his trip. He cov- 
ers her body with his. “Are you 
grooving yet?” she asks. 

He is silent a moment. “1 feel it 
starting,” he tells her. “It’s like 
having two girls at once. Tm get- 
ting echoes.” Tension. The multi- 
plexing must still be ninety sec- 
onds away. All these calculations 
chill him. And then they become 
pointless. “It's happening,” he 
whispers. “Oh, god, here 1 go up!” 

ULTIPLEXING now. His 
spirit is spreading out. The 
drug makes him psychosensitive; it 
breaks down his brain's chemical 
defenses against direct telepathic 
input, so that he can perceive the 
sensory intake of those around 
him. Reaching wider and wider, 
moment by moment. At the full 
high, they say, everyone's eyes 
and ears become your own; you 
pick up an infinity of responses, 
you are everywhere in the build- 
ing at once. Is it true? Are other 
minds pouring their intake 
through his? It does seem so. He 
watches the fluttering fiery 
mantle of his soul engulf and ab- 



sorb Alma. That's just the begin- 
ning. He is spreading over Alma's 
littles now. He is six children and 
their mother. How easy this is! He 
is the family next door. Eight lit- 
tles, mother, nightwalker from 
the 495th floor. He extends his 
reach upward one level. And 
downward. And along the corri- 
dors. In dreamy multiplexication 
he is taking possession of the 
whole building. Layers of drift- 
ing images enshroud him. 500 
floors above his head, 499 below, 
and he sees all 999 of them as a col- 
umn of horizontal striations, 
tiny notches on a tall shaft. With 
ants. And he is all the ants at once. 
Why has he never done this be- 
fore? To become an entire 
urbmon! 

He must reach at least twenty 
floors in each direction now. And 
.‘ttill spreading out. Tendrils of him 
going everywhere. Just the begin- 
ning. Intermingling his substance 
w ith the totality of the building. 

He is dimly aware of Alma but 
only one atom of himself is occu- 
pied with her. The rest isjroaming 
the halls of the cities that make up 
Urban Monad 116. Entering every 
room. Part of him up in Boston, 
part of him down in London, and 
all of him in Rome and Bombay as 
well. Hundreds of rooms. Thou- 
sands. The swarm of biped bees. He 
is fifty squalling littles crammed 
into three London rooms. He is 
two doddering Bostonians entering

upon their five thousandth sexual 
congress. He is a hot-blooded thir- 
teen-year-old nightwalker prowling 
the 483rd floor. He is six swapping 
couples in a London dorm. Now he 
is into a wider range, reaching 
down to San Francisco, up to Nai- 
robi. The farther he goes, the eas- 
ier it gets. The hive. The mighty 
hive. He embraces Tokyo. He em- 
braces Chicago. He embraces 
Prague. He touches Shanghai. He 
touches Vienna. He touches War- 
saw. He touches Toledo. Paris! 
Reykjavik! Louisville! Louisville! 
Top to bottom, top to bottom! 
Now he is all 880,000 people on all 
thousand floors. His soul is 
stretched to its fullest. His skull is 
snapping. The images come and 
go across the screen of his mind, 
drifting films of reality, oily wisps 
of smoke bearing faces, eyes, fin- 
gers, smiles, tongues, elbows, pro- 
files, sounds, textures. Gently 
they mesh and lock and drift apart. 
He is everywhere and everyone at 
once. God bless! For the first time 
he understands the nature of the 
delicate organism that is so- 
ciety; he sees the checks and bal- 
ances, the quiet conspiracies of 
compromise that paste it all to- 
gether. And it is wondrously 
beautiful. Tuning this vast city of 
many cities is Just like tuning the 
cosmos group: everything must 
relate, everything must belong to 
everything else. The poet in San 
Francisco is part of the grubbo 



stoker in Reykjavik. The little 
snotty ambition-monger in Shang- 
hai is part of the placid defeated 
Roman. How much of this, Dillon 
wonders, will stay with him when 
he comes down? His spirit whirls. 
He grooves on thousands of souls 
at once. 

And the sexual thing. The hun- 
dred thousand transactions taking 
place behind his forehead. He loses 
his virginity; he takes a virginity; 
he is aggressor and aggressed. 

H e rides the liftshafts of his 
mind. Going up! 501, 502, 503, 
504, 505! 600! 700! 800! 900! He 
stands on the landing stage at the 
summit of the urbmon, staring out 
into the night. Towers all around 
him, the neighboring monads, 115, 
1 17, 1 18, the whole crowd of them. 
Occasionally he has wondered 
what life is like in the other build- 
ings that make up the Chipitts con- 
stellation. Now he does not care. 
There is wonder enough in 116. 
More than 800,000 intersecting 
lives. He has heard some of his 
friends say, in San Francisco, 
that it was an evil deed to change 
the world this way, to pile up thou- 
sands of people in a single colos- 
sal building, to create this bee- 
hive life. But how wrong those mut- 
terers are! If they could only 
multiplex and get true perspec- 
tive. Taste the rich complexity of 
our vertical existence. Going

“Is it really good?" Alma asks. 
“Your eyes are shining!" 

“I can't describe it," Dillon 
murmurs, soaring, threading him- 
self down the service core to the 
levels below Reykjavik, then float- 
ing up to Louisville again, a'nd si- 
multaneously intersecting every 
point between root and tip. An 
ocean of broiling minds. A sizzle of 



snarled identities. He wonders 
what lime it is. The trip is sup- 
posed to last five hours. He is still 
with Alma, which leads him to 
think he has not been up more than 
ten or fifteen minutes, but perhaps 
it is more than that. Things are 
becoming very tactile now. As he 
drifts through the building he 
touches walls, floors, screens, 
faces, fabrics. He suspects he may 
be coming down. But no. No. Still 
on his way up. The simultaniety 
increases. He is flooded with per- 
cepts. People moving, talking, 
sleeping, dancing, coupling, 
bending, reaching, eating, read- 
ing. I am all of you. You are all 
parts of me. He can focus sharply 
on individual identities. Here is 
Electra, here is Nat the spectrum- 
rider, here is Mamelon Kluver, 
here is a light-souled sociocom- 
putalor named Charles Maltern,

tor, here is a Warsaw grubbo, 
here is. Here is. Here are. Here am 
/. The whole blessing building. 

Oh what a beautiful place. Oh 
how 1 love it here. Oh this is the 
real thing. Oh! 

W HEN he comes down, he sees 
the dark-haired woman curled 
in a corner of the sleeping plat- 
form, asleep. He cannot remem- 
ber her name. He touches her thigh 
and she awakes quickly, eyes flut- 
tering. “Hello," she says. “Wel- 
come back." 

“What's your name?” 

“Alma. Clune. Your eyes are all 
red." 

He nods. He feels the weight of 
the whole building on him. 500 
floors jamming down on his head, 
499 floors pressing up against his 
feet. The meeting place of the two 
forces is somewhere close to his 
pancreas. If he does not leave here 
quickly, his internal organs must 
surely pop. Only shreds of his trip 
remain. Straggly streamers of 
debris clutter his mind. Vaguely 
he feels columns of ants trekking 
from level to level behind his 
eyes. 

Alma reaches for him. To com- 
fort him. He shakes her off and 
hunts for his clothing. A cone of 
silence surrounds him. He will go 
back to Electra, he thinks, and try 
to tell her where he has been and 
what has been happening to him, 
and then perhaps he will cry and 



feel better. He leaves without 
thanking Alma for her hospitality 
and looks for a dropshaft. Instead 
he finds a liftshaft, and somehow, 
pretending it is an accident, he 
gets off at 530. Heading for 
Rome’s sonic center. Dark there. 
The instruments still on stage. 
Quietly he slips down in front of 
the vibrastar. Switches it on. His 
eyes are wet. He dredges up some 
phantom images of his trip. The 
faces, the thousand floors. The 
ecstasy. Oh, what a beautiful 
place. Oh, how I love it here. Oh. 
this is the real thing. Oh! Certain- 
ly he felt that way. But no longer. 
A thin sediment of doubt is all that 
remains. Asking himself: Is this 
how it was meant to be? Is this how 
it has to be? Is this the best we can 
do? This building. This mighty 
hive. Dillon’s hands caress the 
projectrons, which feel prickly 
and hot; he depresses them at ran- 
dom and sour colors drift out of 
the instrument. He cuts in the au- 
dio and gets sounds that remind 
him of the shifting of old bones 
within flabby flesh. What went 
wrong? He should have expected 
it. You go all the way up, then you 
come all the way down. But why 
does down have to be so far down? 
He cannot bear to play. After ten 
minutes he switches off the vi- 
brastar and goes out. He will walk 
to San Francisco. 160 floors 
down. That’s not too many levels; 
he’ll be there before dawn. if

I F YOU take Rene Barjavel’s The 
Ice People (Morrow, $5.95) and 
reduce it to its essentials, you get 
pure soap opera. But this book is 
not for skeletonizing; it is for read- 
ing, and as reading it’s superb. For 
once a jacket blurb is borne out: I 
couldn't put it down, despite the 
fact that no less a source than Le 
Magazine Litteraire* challenged 
me to do so. 

What we have here, cadets, is a 
spiffy colloquial English transla- 
tion by Charles Lam Markmann 
of a story that owes rather more 
to Georges Simenon than it does 
to Jules Verne. It crackles along 
like a lit fuse. Though you realize 
rather early that Barjavel has not 
laid his charge under anything pro-

found, and furthermore can see 
the way the cards are going to 
tumble when the keg fizzes up, he 
takes care to do the thing you have 
to do in a pulp suspense novel — he 
peoples his story solely with char- 
acters for whom bathos and trag- 
edy are the same thing. So, for as 
long as you’re still reading, harsh 
judgment does not intrude and 
the experience goes down whole in 
one tingling morsel. 

The book comes to us with all 
sorts of assurances that it sold 
300,000 copies in F/ance, where it 
was “a Number One best seller” 
(italic mine), but don’t let that put 
you off. Jean Rostand of the 
Academie Francaise (like the voice 
of the Wizard of Oz) declares that 
“Barjavel places before each man 
the problem of the meaning of 
life.” Pay no attention to that.

either. As we both know, the prop- 
osition that writers have these 
unique abilities is nonsense on the 
face of it; furthermore, Barjavel’s 
interest is confined to telling us 
how two people got placed in sus- 
pended animation 900,000 years 
ago in a place that’s now down in 
the rock under Antarctica and 
what’s involved in their discovery, 
revival, and utilization in 20th 
Century society. 

Judging by the way this book is 
being packaged — Marc Slonim is 
cited on the back cover, saying: 
“. the author’s ironic references 
to our ‘post-Gutenberg, pre-Apoc- 
alyptic’ era” (those are synthe- 
sized quasi-quotes from McLu- 
han, not from Barjavel’s text) — a 
serious attempt is being made to 
give this volume some kind of 
“relevance,” panache, and within- 
ness. If you approach it from that 
route, you’ll be disappointed. It’s 
boy-meets-girl, boy-freezes-girl, is 
what it is, and it’s one of the best 
science-fiction suspense novels of 
the year. 

I T’S a bit late — later than usual 
— but I’d like to review Clifford 
D. Simak’s Doubleday ($4.95) col- 
lection, Best Science Fiction Stor- 
ies of Clifford D. Simak. 

Cliff Simak would be as 
shocked as I’d be if I were to as- 
sert that he’s a towering literary 
figure, in this field or any other. 
He’s something other than that^ 



in this field and in at least one oth- 
er; he’s a charitable, observant, 
gentle man of acumen and profes- 
sional skill. When he exercises his 
profession these qualities have the 
effect of making the reader feel 
good to be in the company of the 
people in Cliff Simak’s stories. 

This is a rare way to go about 
holding the reader’s interest. Les- 
ter del Rey can do it and some- 
times chooses to; what Ted Stur- 
geon does is only superficially like 
it; Isaac Asimov has done it now 
and again. But Simak does it in 
all his successful stories, perhaps 
with some deliberateness which 
might yield to technical analysis; 
mostly. I’d think, because that’s 
the kind of guy he is. 

You may know — if you’ve been 
around, because Simak has been 
with us for a long time— that sev- 
eral paces back before World War 
II he was the author of formula 
stories with only flashes of indi- 
viduality. Then something hap- 
pened; maybe getting a raise at 
the paper, so the economic pres- 
sure was off his freelancing, may- 
be the War itself, maybe maturity. 
Whatever it was, it produced a 
series of heart-wrenchingly effec- 
tive stories in the Astounding of 
the early 1940s. I will tell you 
frankly that I used to get my face 
beaten in for sitting in the school- 
bus and weeping over an opened 
copy of a pulp magazine. (Actual- 
ly, I got my face beaten in for my 



162 



GALAXY 




reaction to the reaction to my sit- 
ting there weeping, etc., which 
may go toward proving my con- 
tention that what’s important is 
what happens in the reader, not on 
the paper). 

Anyway, this flowering of Si- 
mak’s ability is still his major pe- 
riod. During this time he wrote the 
series that was collected as the 
book City, plus a number of semi- 
related and unrelated stories which 
all bore this hallmark of an all- 
embracing honest compassion for 
even the lowliest and most com- 
pulsive of the creatures in his 
imagination. Then he dropped out 
for a while — again, I don’t know 
why — and came back for the one 
triumph he had not enjoyed be- 
fore. He had proved himself with 
those novelettes and short stories. 
Now the author of the pre-War 
Cosmic Engineers — believe me, 
it’s like what it sounds — started 
Galaxy off in life with what this 
magazine called Time Quarry, the 
book version is Time and Again, 
the novel about Asher Sutton, the 
Messiah-figure I rather prefer to 
Valentine Smith. In that book are 
a number of striking parallels to 
Stranger in a Strange Land, as 
there would be in any Messiah 
story. It’s not written to turn you 
on to anything, either; it’s simply 
a notably strong, well-told, sci- 
ence-fiction story of great ingenu- 
ity and compassion. 

And that was in the early 1950s. 



Since then, Simak has written a 
number of short stories and novel- 
ettes for diverse places, most of 
them for Galaxy, I believe. He’s 
written other novels, none of them 
with Time and Again's all-of-a- 
piece excellence. He won a Hugo 
in 1964 for Way Station — there 
were no Hugos in 1951 — and all in 
all, according to the flyleaf on this 
latest collection, he has nineteen 
different first editions of his own 
books on a shelf somewhere in his 
mind. 

What he is, when you come 
down, to it, is a man who has con- 
tributed a lot to this field over a 
long period of time, not making 
many big splashes, but getting the 
job done; reaching the reader, and 
boosting the field at least some lit- 
tle way up the ladder. (What’s ex- 
pressed in Simak’s most famous 
last line; "... and me back into a 
man” is a dynamite concept to 
have thrown out into the field as it 
was in the 1940s. There were quite 
a few who never forgot it, and at 
least one editor who really didn’t 
like the basic proposition once it 
had soaked in). 

So that’s my review of Best 
Science Fiction Stories of Clifford 
D. Simak. These are not Cliff’s 
best — there are seven of them in 
the book, and Founding Father, 
from a 1957 Galaxy, is the one that 
most closely captures the effect of 
what Simak could do to you if he 
wanted to — but that doesn’t make

them bad, or inconsiderable. They 
are professional writing from an 
uncommon man who is at once 
archetypal of the good side of the 
commercial writer and nearly 
unique in his major professional 
strength as displayed here. Some 
of the plots are thin. Some of the 
incidents are trivial. All of it re- 
pays reading and repays in an espe- 
cially gratifying kind of coin. 

O F ALL the people in this col- 
umn, David Compton is the one 
who is actively and continuously 
trying to make something larger 
out of the story he happens to be 
telling; you can feel the pressure 
at your elbow. 

In Synthajoy, this trait was sub- 
tly exercised; although you did 
not love her, the heroine of this 
book about neurostimulation was 
a stunningly characterized person, 
and exactly the character through 
whom that story ought to have 
been told. But then, after a while 
we got The Steel Crocodile, which 
is very nearly a parody of Syntha- 
joy, and which made it rather 
clear that Synthajoy was not about 
neurostimulation; like Crocodile, 
and like an intervening minor 
book. The Silent Multitude, it was 
about Man's inability to cope, 
sanely with the facts of the Uni- 
verse. So, too, is Compton’s latest 
Ace Special (Chronocules, 10480, 
75c). 

That’s a proposition you have 



to consider. Maybe the world is 
too big a place for even the might- 
iest cosmic engineer; if so, then it 
follows that no one can grasp any 
part of it by the correct handle ex- 
cept in moments of pure luck 
which are soon dissipated or 
crushed either by the simple turn- 
ing of the grand wheel or by the 
conflicting obsessions of more 
powerful individuals. Then it may 
follow that there is no salvation 
in anything, and the sane course is 
to live decently and'unambitiously 
— presumably so as to minimize 
the dynamic attentions of others, 
since the wheel will turn where it 
wills in any case. 

A review of Compton’s Ace 
books will show that common de- 
nominator. Illusion applied di- 
rectly to the brain is a trap; the 
edifice of Faith can not sustain 
the Faithful; the mechanical Mes- 
siah will save only himself; and 
in Chronocules we have it that 
there’s no place to hide, not even 
in the whispering galleries of time 
itself. 

But there’s a loophole in each 
of these books. If the heroine of 
Synthajoy had been more stable, 
and if her lover and her husband 
hadn’t acted in exactly the way 
they did . If the wife in The 
Steel Crocodile hadn’t . If the 
heroine of Chronocules had . 

What the analysis seems to 
yield as the essence of Compton’s 
message to the bemused world is 



164 



GALAXY 




that technology induces hysteria 
in women. And that we should 
probably be grateful, else all sorts 
of dreadful projects would have 
come to clanging fruition. 

I’d be doing Compton a con- 
siderable injustice, by the way, if 
I implied that he’s silly, stupid, 
untalented, or unskilled. He is the 
opposite of all that. He may be 
wrong — whatever it is he’s saying, 
or building up to saying — but he’s 
far from negligible. He’s a find 
for Terry Carr, and he’s consis- 
tently capable of high performance. 
Chronocules is nearly as good 
throughout as Synthajoy was, and 
even Crocodile had its moments 
when it was obvious the clay was 
in a master’s hands, for all that it 
was coming out lopsided. 

Nevertheless, I find it remark- 
able that in Compton’s view there 
is no way to tell a science-fiction 
story without basing its denoue- 
ment squarely on the interaction 
of a power-obsessed male and a 
sexually tensed female. 

In Chronocules — which is, if 
you haven’t yet given up hope of 
finding out from me, the story of 
a privately endowed attempt to 
force a way into the future before 
pollution and disorganization de- 
stroy the mother country — the 
female goes completely crackers, 
as she did in Synthajoy, but in this 
version she does so in response to 
her experience of sex au naturel 
from the first simple, uncompli- 



cated, definitely non-technological 
male she's ever loved in a life of 
social promiscuity. Whereupon 
she seizes power, displaces the 
owner of the establishment, sur- 
vives the holocaust, and in due 
time kills her resulting son, to be 
apprehended with the gun still 
warm in her hand. 

What I’m building up to saying 
is that the proposition that the 
world is inevitably too big a place 
may be a lonely child’s fantasy, 
for all that it has many subscribers 
among our numbers. That would 
explain its power, and its ability to 
encyst such obvious defects as the 
truck riot scene in Chronocules 
without suffering any diminution 
of effect. 

The scene is a mess. A crowd 
immobilizes an armored truck 
and kills the crew inside it. The 
truck is “impregnably designed” 
to deliver the research establish- 
ment payroll at a time when every 
crowd is full of hopheads and van- 
dals. It (1) is unarmed, (2) is 
equipped with pneumatic tires that 
yield immediately to explosive, 
despite the fact that the armed 
services of most nations today 
have explosion-proof tires, (3) set- 
tles immediately on its “brake 
drums,” apparently having no 
wheels, since Compton speaks 
eventually of shreds of tire cling- 
ing to the “drums,” and (4) broils 
its crew when its roof is sprayed 
with “heat foam,” apparently a 



GALAXY BOOKSHELF 



165 




substance which generates heat by 
expansion and conveys it down- 
ward. 

The truck also has an “electri- 
fied chassis” which shorts out on 
contact with the street. I won- 
dered, hard, about the wisdom of 
a defensive measure which not 
only screws up all your ignition 
grounds and auxiliary wiring but 
which is kept from doing attackers 
any harm, thanks to a protective 
shroud of apparently unelectrified 
body sheet metal. 

Hence in that, scene, crucial to 
major subsequent events, Comp- 
ton describes an impossible piece 
of technology overcome with lu- 
dicrous ease by instruments acting 
in violation of several laws of 
physics. And yet 1 must tell you 
that I could smell and hear that 
crowd; 1 wanted to believe in that 
crowd. 

You know, when you boil it 
down, it’s a bald affront. The mes- 
sage says you should always stick 
your thumb in your mouth and 
draw up your knees. But when you 
spread the same message over 
four books — or four hundred 
books by a hundred different writ- 
ers at various levels of conscious 
control over their emissions — it 
takes longer to grasp, and that’s 
what may be so effective about it. 
Because it is the message we’ve 
always wanted to hear. We’re just 
coy about how we want it pre- 
sented. 



Compton may be on to a very 
good thing. 

A nd that brings us to Science 
Against Man, (Avon Books 
#V2374, 75c), an anthology of or- 
iginal stories which include, among 
others, John Brunner’s The Invis- 
ible Idiot, whose title is derived 
from the well-known anecdote 
about what happens when you re- 
translate Out of sight, out of mind, 
after feeding it into a computer 
that translates Chinese. 

The editor of this volume is 
Anthony Cheetham, who presum- 
ably came up with the theme and 
who certainly supplied the some- 
times nonsequential editorial 
comments heading each story. 
Cheetham is no Lem — he falls 
headlong for the trap that Solar- 
is gingerly clambers into — but 
the result is the same. 

Cheetham has to be one of those 
people who feels threatened by but 
fails to distinguish among science, 
engineering and technology, 
three different things not of the 
same kind, and who does some- 
how differentiate between Man 
and what men do, none of which 
are mistakes that Lem’s mind will 
let him commit as gladly. 

Until we realize -we all real- 
ize — that each of us — each of 
us — would joyously destroy the 
entire world, given only the 
proper circumstances, as well as 
the means, just as the same each of

US would willingly transl'orm it 
into Paradise, again given the 
circumstances, as well as the 
means, and until we stop finding 
in “science” or what we call 
God, or politics, or xlkmndfg — 
some external cause for human 
nature, not even the Sierra Club 
will save us, for nothing can save 
us but reason and, beyond that, an 
understanding and acceptance of 
reason, none of which can be im- 
posed, all of which must be found 
within himself by each of us. 

Hence, “science fiction" themes 
which interfere in this process, no 
matter in what nobility's name, are 
contrasurvival; Cheetham's pre- 
mise is contrasurvival and 
Cheetham is contrasurvival in 
this act. Other than that, there's 
nothing wrong with his book, 
which contains excellent stories 
by Brian Aldiss, Harry Harri- 
son and Norman Spinrad, good 
ones by Piers Anthony, James 
Blish, John Brunner, Bob Shaw, 
and Robect Silverberg, and ac- 
ceptable ones by Paul Ableman, 
Michael Moorcock, and Andrew 
Travers. That's quite a batting 
average. 

Of them all, the Silverberg is the 
most effectively moody, being a 
series of declarative sentences 
about a neurotic megalopolitaine 
who, quite so, eventually recon- 
ciles herself to the trauma of being 
moved into a new building, but 
only after some rather easy 



therapy. The Spinrad, on the oth- 
er hand, is as apparently sim- 
plistic and jargon-loaded as his 
usual piece. This one is about 
African tourists visiting the 
noxious remains of smog-choked 
America. But the detailed breadth 
of Spinrad's imagination in this 
example creates that effect 
which marks excellent fiction; it 
conveys the sense that the writer 
unfalteringly believed in every 
single thing he says happened to 
his characters. 

That seamless strength of 
authorial conviction — which al- 
so occurs in the Aldiss and Harri- 
son — is the one unique capability 
of fiction as distinguished from 
propaganda or any other form of 
philosophical discourse. The 
author may be wrong, as the es- 
sayist may be wrong, but it is dif- 
ficult to resist the spell of a 
proposition told against a back- 
ground whose every precisely 
placed blade of grass testifies to 
the consistency of the creator's 
thinking. 

Conversely, of course, when 
the author can be seen to falter 
somewhere, his statement may 
never recover from that stumble 
over what may in fact have been a 
minor area or, as in the Silver- 
berg, that proper, obligatory 
move you'd think could be indi- 
cated with a wave of the hand. But 
it can't. There are no throwaway 
lines.

DUCKWORTH AND 
THE SOUND PROBE 



LARRY EISENBERG 



169 




I HAD not seen Duckworth in 
many weeks. His marriage, after 
a whirlwind courtship and an 
around-the-world-tour with his 
bride, had cut down our contact to 
a one-sided receipt of post cards 
from the Temple at Angkor Wat 
and a long-distance shot of the 
Tuileries with indecipherable inked 
greetings. The chemistry depart- 
ment missed him too. 

On several occasions students 
would drift by the computer lab to 
ask me if I knew of a firm date for 
Duckworth’s return. I shrugged, 
spread my hands and even sighed. 
And they understood and left the 
room silently. Imagine my sur- 
prise, then, when Ducksworth tele- 
phoned to ask me to join him in his 
office. 

We embraced warmly. 

“How is Laura?” I asked. 

A beatific smile played about 
Duckworth’s lips. 

“If anything could make me 
chuck science, it’s that girl,” he 
said dreamily. Then he shook him- 
self like a wet fox terrier. “But 
that’s neither here nor there,” he 
muttered. He looked at me bright- 
ly. “I’ve got a new idea I’d like to 
discuss with you.” 

“Fire away,” I said. 

“It’s an idea that took form 
during my honeymoon,” he said. 

I smirked. 

“It’s not salacious,” he said, 
shaking his head reprovingly. “But 
it has tremendous possibilities. 



It combines ideas of physics and 
chemistry in a rather novel way. 
In short. I’m talking about the re- 
covery of sounds, old sounds that 
are buried in the long distant 
past.” 

I rubbed my chin. 

“That’s quite an order,” I said. 
“Even in a medium without ab- 
sorbing or reflecting boundaries 
the intensity of the sound falls off 
as the square of the distance. In 
any kind of confined space the 
sound would be absorbed, dis- 
persed, reflected back and forth 
until literally nothing remained 
of the original waves.” 

“That’s true in a way,” said 
Duckworth. “But not quite. The 
sounds can never die completely. In 
a room, for example, the sounds 
are still there, batting around, but 
at such fantastically low energy 
levels that no detector on Earth 
could possibly retrieve them. But 
I think I have a way of getting 
around that barrier.” 

1 smiled. 

“You’ve done many things I 
considered impossible,” I said. 
“But this time your reach is way 
beyond our grasp. I don’t think it 
can be done.” 

“There are two fundamental 
problems,” said Duckworth, play- 
ing with the wispy strands of his 
skimpy beard. “The first involves 
sensitivity and the second, noise 
level. I have a way of achieving suf- 
ficient sensitivity to pick up and 



170 



GALAXY 




amplify the faint sounds. But so far 
I’ve been stymied by the submolec- 
ular noises of my electronic com- 
ponents.” 

I nodded. 

“Their noisy energy levels are 
probably much higher than those 
of the sounds you’re trying to re- 
trieve.” 

“Precisely,” said Duckworth. 
“But suppose I could convert their 
random fluctuations into an 
ordered variation that could be fil- 
tered out?” 

“That’s a big suppose,” I said. 

And there our conversation 
ended. 

S EVERAL weeks later my wife 
and I were invited over to the 
Duckworth home to sample Lau- 
ra’s cooking. It was imaginative, 
even daring, but it wasn’t good. 
The lemon soup had lumps and the 
Chicken Bangkok was underdone. 
But I grimly stuffed it into my face 
and pretended to agree with Duck- 
worth as he raved about his wife’s 
culinary skills. 1 even toyed with 
the idea of investing in a rented 
stomach pump. But I felt to do so 
would be disloyal to my friends. 

It was later that evening, as I 
was meditatively sucking on my 
second roll of antacid mints, that 
Duckworth casually mentioned 
that he had licked the second part 
of his sound problem. In my ex- 
citement 1 almost swallowed the 
mint, whole. 



“How did you do it?” I cried. 

“It proved to be easier than I 
thought,” said Duckworth mod- 
estly. “I cooled my amplifier to al- 
most absolute zero in temper- 
ature, reducing noise fluctu- 
ations to a minimum. Then 1 ap- 
plied accurately controlled mag- 
netic fields to the circuit ele- 
ments.” 

“My God!” I said. “You’ve 
done it.” 

“Not quite,” said Duckworth. 
“I’m close but not there yet.” 
“Then your Sound Probe isn’t 
ready to try out?” 

“To tell you the truth,” said 
Duckworth, “I did set it up off 
campus, last week. It was at the 
site of an old Chinese restaurant.” 
“And?” 

“I didn’t get too much,” said 
Duckworth. “Just a few nasal lan- 
guage sounds. But it pointed up 
where the next phase of my work 
lies. I now have the job of selecting 
a particular sequence of sounds 
out of uncountable levels of other 
sounds, unwanted sounds that 
may have lesser or even greater 
energy levels.” 

“It sounds like the proverbial 
search for a needle in a haystack.” 
“Something like that,’’ said 
Duckworth glumly. 

“But those Chinese sounds you 
recovered. My God, man, you 
should be elated! You’ve got 
enough to publish right there.” 

“I don’t know,” said Duck- 

171 



DUCKWORTH AND THE SOUND PROBE 




worth. “It seems a bit premature 
to me.” 

“It’s never too early to disclose 
something that important,” 1 said. 

Duckworth shrugged. Laura,* 
who had come up with some rock- 
hard cookies she had baked, caught 
the tail end of my remarks and 
added her own weight to the argu- 
ment. 

“I agree,” she said. “You ought 
at least to establish your priority in 
this field.” 

Before this combined pressure, 
Duckworth, to his later regret, 
yielded. 

H IS article was brief and titled. 
The Sound Probe. It appeared 
in Modern Acoustic Letters in less 
than a page of space and seemed to 
be missed by the press. But not for 
long. An astute science reporter 
caught the possibilities of Duck- 
worth’s device and the dam burst. 
Overnight, he was inundated by 
waves of reporters, much as he 
had been in past years. Tiring as 
the publicity aspect was, it was 
nothing compared to the stream 
of visitors who now assailed Duck- 
worth’s office with their own spe- 
cial requests. 

First cajne the editor of Voyeur 
Magazine, a journal for funloving 
men, who asked Duckworth if it 
would be possible to retrieve 
conversations from the boudoir 
of Madame Pompadour. 

The second visitor was a well 



known Protestant evangelist who 
wished to recover some of the dia- 
logues of Renaissance Popes from 
their private quarters at the Vati- 
can. 

There was also the medium who 
foresaw the probe as a two-way 
device that might recover future 
sounds as well as past ones. Duck- 
worth was intrigued by this idea. 

“A sort of wedding of Physics 
and Metaphysics,” he mused. “But 
not even a double-barreled shot- 
gun could carry that, one off.” 
“Why not?” asked the medium 
happily. So happy was she that it 
took all of Duckworth’s self-con- 
trol to keep from striking her. 

“The equations of motion,” she 
said earnestly, “reveal no for- 
ward or backward direction in 
time. Isn’t it conceivable that the 
sounds of the future are kicking 
about just as those of the past are?” 
“Perhaps,” said Duckworth. “It 
seems to me that even now I can 
detect your future laments about 
how ungracious I was in kicking 
you out of my office.” 

One of the most trying visitors 
was Ernest Gudgeon, chairman 
of the Board of Gudgeon Indus- 
tries. A roly-poly man who was 
perpetually mopping his brow 
with a fine silk handkerchief, he 
came directly to the point. 

“Dr. Duckworth,” he said, 
“your new scheme has possibil- 
ities that I’m sure even you haven’t 
thought of.” 



172 



GALAXY 




“No doubt,” said Duckworth 
dryly. 

“1 refer of course to the rough 
and tumble world of industrial in- 
formation gathering." 

“Industrial espionage might be 
more appropriate," said Duck- 
worth. 

“It has a pejorative quality," 
said Gudgeon. “But no matter. 
What I’m proposing relates to 
the freer interchange in ideas 
among American businessmen, a 
freer interchange that will enable 
our industries to outstrip all 
world competitors. East and 
West." 

“I suppose it means visiting con- 
ference rooms after meetings, ex- 
ecutive washrooms and that sort of 
thing. I can see myself dressed in 
blue overalls, twirling the dials of 
my apparatus over the hoarse sob- 
bing of flushed toilets," said 
Duckworth. 



A FEW weeks later, over an un- 
watered Jack Daniels at the 
Faculty Club, Duckworth unbur- 
dened his heart to me. 

“I had been toying with the idea 
of abandoning this project. Up to 
now I’ve had nothing but grief 
from it. And just as I’d made up 
my mind to pull the chain on the 
Sound Probe, I solved my last 
problem.” 

“Picking the right sounds out of 
all the sounds?” I asked. 



“That’s it," said Duckworth. 
“First 1 store all the sounds that 
are recovered on magnetic tape 
in digital form. These sounds are 
now examined by statistical 
methods. For example, only 
those sounds and words which by 
frequency, sequence, and gram- 
matical construction of the par- 
ticular language are most prob- 
able, will be chosen to be played 
back. In that way I can pick out the 
wanted sounds from the un- 
wanted. It’s not perfect, but it 
ought to work well enough." 

“It sounds plausible to me,” 1 
said. “But I think you have more 
trouble pending. 1 was in Presi- 
dent Hinkle’s office this morn- 
ing, fighting to keep my budget 
from being cut in half. Just before 
I left he got a call from Counter- 
spy, our multibillion dollar 
Ferieral agency with the unlisted 
phone numbers. 1 think they plan 
to use the Sound Probe to recover 
dialogues from foreign embas- 
sies." 

“That does it,” said Duckworth. 
“I’m going to burn my notes and 
put an axe to my instrumenta- 
tion.” 

“You’re copping out," I said. 
"Besides, your paper contains 
enough information so that with 
perhaps an additional year’s 
work, some astute physicist will 
come up with a working model. 
Counterspy can get alpng with- 
out your help if they have to." 



DUCKWORTH ANDTHE SOUND PROBE 



173 




“1 suppose you’re right,” he said 
bitterly. 

“What’s more,” I added, “the 
Sound Probe is probably being 
evaluated by the espionage ser- 
vices of every country in the 
world. It may force the suspen- 
sion of all private political con- 
versations from now on.” 

Duckworth leaped to his feet. 

He cried, “You’ve done it! 
You’ve shown me the way out.” 

1 was delighted but puzzled. 

“1 have? How?” 

Duckworth put his finger to the 
side of his nose. 

“Mum’s the word,” he said and 
winked at me. 

{ PONDERED the meaning of 
that wink, off and on, for sever- 
al months. And then I saw the news 
story on the front page of the New 
York Times. 

Duckworth’s Delvers(it 
said). Emmett Duckworth, 
Nobel Laureate and eminent 
biochemist, announced today 
the forming of a student 
army of Truthseekers. 
Equipped with a new porta- 
ble version of a device he re- 
cently perfected which can 
recover entire conversations 
from the past, his students 
will visit every smoke-filled 
room, the chambers and 
meeting halls of every legis- 
lative body in the United 



States and even the august 
committee rooms of the 
United Nations. 

“The Delvers,” Dr. Duck- 
worth said, will focus on po- 
litical deals of every kind 
with particular emphasis on 
financial hanky panky. How- 
ever, illicit private peccadil- 
loes of heads of state will not 
be overlooked. In addition, 
similar groups are being 
formed in Europe and Afri- 
ca, all armed with the new 
Duckworth Sound Probe. 

I barged into Duckworth’s lab 
and showed him the story. He 
beamed at me genially. 

“I know all about it,” he said. 
“The press spent a couple of days 
with me earlier in the week. I told 
them about my miniaturized 
portable version of the Sound 
Probe and how I planned to use it. 
For some reason they seemed to 
think the item newsworthy.” 

“For shame, Duckworth,” I 
cried. “Twice a Nobel prize win- 
ner and you’re lending your name 
and skills to making snoopers out 
of college students?” 

“Learners,” said Duckworth. 
“Students of fact. History as we 
know it is always written — or at 
least censored — by the winners. 
Who knows what squalid details 
my crew will uncover — not only 
scandals, but suppression of vi- 
tal information about how gov- 



174 



GALAXY 




ernments really work. It may 
shake the corrupters of this re- 
public and even alter interna- 
tional alignments — ” 

I had been scratching my chin 
thoughtfully. 

“I never thought of that,” I said 
when Duckworth abruptly broke 
off. “Your youngsters might be 
the salvation of us all. At last 
we’d have a clear picture of who 
and what we all are.” 

“I’m afraid I was a little carried 
away just then,” said Duckworth, 
blushing. “Actually it’ll never 
happen that way. But I’m playing 
for more realistic stakes.” 

“You mean that the students 
won’t be allowed to carry out 
their delving? Then why did you 
initiate this affair?” And then the 



insight hit me. “You want to make 
it impossible for Counterspy to 
use your device,” 1 said. 

Duckworth seized my hand and 
shook it warmly. 

“Sometimes,” he said, “your 
ability to grasp elementary strate- 
gy truly amazes me.” 

Four months later, in a move un- 
precedented in international an- 
nals, every member of the United 
Nations signed a protocol ban- 
ning the use of the Sound Probe. 
Duckworth was given one of the 
pens used in the signing. After- 
ward we withdrew to the back- 
yard of my home where 1 fed a slow 
fire with the drawings of the 
Sound Probe as Duckworth 
toasted marshmallows. ★

gram have already been felt. 

A list of potential Receivers is 
kept at transplant centers from 
coast to coast — and you or I or 
both of us might one day play on 
that side, too. 

Mr. Pendzick was a kidney trans- 
plant recipient shortly before 
the Foundation’s program was 
launched; his donor was his moth- 
er, but he feels all humans might 
one day come to relate to one an- 
other as if we all mattered. 

It seems a game to play — un- 
less we fear some evil. 



• “Proactive inhibition” is a little- 
known but apparently fairly uni- 
versal brain phenomenon plaguing 
mankind. Laboratory tested, it 
manifests itself in the tendency of 
an earlier memory — or bit of learn- 
ing — to suppress or interfere with 
a later one. 

That we live on a destructible — 
even frail — planet has become evi- 
dent to nearly everyone, but for 
most of us the earliest memory 
was of a firm Earth, an impene- 
trable sky and an unshakable con- 
tract with what had gone before. 
It has made it difficult for many 
to grasp that since then we’ve be- 
come, as a species, the most pow- 
erful natural force rampant on the 



175 





planet — and that forces of nature 
know no contracts, obey no laws 
save their own. 

This may have been the major 
lesson members of the newer gen- 
eration — whose earliest awareness 
embraced the atom, war and hu- 
man divisionism as compulsory 
national pastimes — learned in the 
confused and tragic Jackson and 
Kent State campus confrontations 
in the spring of 1970. And in the bit- 
ter aftermaths. 

Since then the irreplaceable 
young have been silent — perhaps 
thoughtfully storing proactive early 
memories that will one day 
shape and rule a saner world. 



• The current economy has caught 
up with us. Not only has distribu- 
tion tightened, but printing costs 
have almost doubled since we took 
over the Galaxy publications two 
years ago, forcing us once again 
to publish bimonthly. The latest 
blow came too suddenly for ex- 
planations to be made in the last 
issue. 

A magazine is as good as its au- 
thors and its audience make it. 
Authors’ rates have not been af- 
fected, nor story lengths — type 
does have some elasticity. And we 
are inviting (see page 3) fuller par- 
ticipation by our distinguished read- 
ership. That’s you.

SIN OF OMISSION 

like the front rover of the May-June Galaxy, our 
fate is mainly red. 

So we apologize. Why? Betause our good friends 
and yours, the Sciente Fiction Book Club, ran an ad- 
vertisement on the back cover. And the printer 
omitted the very thing that would have made the ad- 
vertisement intelligible! 

Horrendous, say we. Mysterious, say you. 

Yes. But the mystery is easily cleared up. Just close- 
ly examine the advertisement on the back cover of 
this issue— and you'll see what was missing from the 
back cover of the May-June issue. That's right. An ob- 
iect that can be described as a "black dat, circle, 
sphere, neutron, eye pupil, tunnel opening, planet, 
hole, cosmos," Wow! 

Again, our apologies to you, treasured readers, 
and ta off others concerned.

The day I firsf nohced the small pink spot on my 
cheek, I had other things on my mind. The New York 
papers said, “Marguerite Piazza opens at the Persian 
Room". I covered the spot with makeup, walked out 
into the spotlight, and forgot it— forgot everything — 
in the joy of singing. 

It wasn't until the spot began to spread, that I went 
to a cancer specialist. The day the doctor told me I'd 
have to have radical face surgery, I was sure my career 
was over. It was no longer a matter of soving my looks. 
Just of saving my life. 

They kept the mirrors in my hospital room covered 
for a week. And yet today, thanks to the fontastic skill 



of the surgeons, I sing in the spotlight again. I let myself 
be photographed full-face by a famous photogropher 
of glamorous women. And I am alive. 

So now you know why I am appealing to you on 
behalf of the Americon Cancer Society. To give money. 
To get regular checkups. And to pay attention to can- 
cer's warning signols. 

You know, there's something much worse than find- 
ing out you have cancer. And that's not finding out. 

American Cancer Society, ^ 

We want to wipe out cancer in your |ifetime.T« 




What is it? 

A black dot, circle, sphere, neutron, eye pupil, tunnel opening, planet, hole, cosmos ? 



Depending on your perspective, knowledge, 
imagination, the answer can be simple or 
complex, commonplace or extraordinary, def- 
inite or infinite. 

We’d like to introduce you to some unique- 
ly gifted authors who have created an excit- 
ing, mind-stretching literature. Writers who 
can look at a dot or a pebble and see a uni- 
verse of sub-atomic particles. Who can 
speculate on the incredible number of inter- 
dependent cells that make up a human body 



and envision .whole planetary life forms inter- 
connected the same way. 

Who forecast things like nuclear power, 
supersonic jets, computers, space probes, and 
moon walks long before they happened. Sci- 
ence Fiction authors are writing tomorrow’s 
history today. 

Just $1 will bring you any three books de- 
scribed on this page. With them comes your 
enrollment in The Science Fiction Book 
Club, the frontier of the future. Join today.
