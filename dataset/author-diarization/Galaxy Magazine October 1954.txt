MENTAL CREATING 

I F YOU just like to dream, read no fur- 
ther. There comes a time when your 
fancies must be brought into light — and 
stand the test of every-day, hard realities. 
Are you one of the thousands— perhaps 
millions— whose thoughts never get' 
beyond the stage of wistful wishing? Do .. 
you often come to from a daydream with 
the sigh, "If only I could bring it about — 
make it real?” ' 

All things begin with thought— it is what 
follows that may take your life out of 
the class of those who hope and dream. 
Thought energy, like anything else, can 
be dissipated — or it cap be made to pro- 
duce actual effects .Ifyou know how to place 
your thoughts you can stimulate the crea- 
tive processes within your mind— through 
them you can assemble things and condi- 
tions of your world into a nappy life of 
accomplishment. Mental creating does not 
depend upon a magical process. It consists 
of knowing how to marshal your thpughts 
into a power that draws, compels and 
organizes your experiences into a worth- 
while design of living.

Let the Rosicrucians tell you how you may 
accomplish these things. The Rosicrucians 
(not a religious organization), a world- 
wide philosophical fraternity, have pre-

knowledge of the functioning of the inner 
mind of man. They have taught men and

THE AMERICAN HUMANIST ASSOCIATION 

in cooperation with 

GALAXY MAGAZINE 

announces its third annual 

STORY CONTEST 

limited to short stories with a science fiction theme by college undergraduates only 

$750 FIRST PRIZE 



Humanism may be described in brief as the belief that Man must solve his own problems, 
and that by far the strongest tool he has ever developed for problem-solving is scientific 
method. This theme pervades much of modern fiction of all types, and may be termed 
almost a working definition of the best science fiction. We would classify as “humanistic” 
most of the stories appearing in GALAXY Science Fiction Magazine. 

In order to discover competent new writers of humanistic science fiction, the American 
Humanist Association and GALAXY Science Fiction Magazine have agreed to co-sponsor 
a Humanist Science Fiction Short Story Contest. The object of this contest is to find GOOD 
fiction— we are not interested in thinly disguised sermons. Although stories entered in the 
contest should have a humanistic approach, chief weight in the judging will be given to 
freshness of theme, sharp characterization and interpersonal conflict, and ingenuity of plot 
development and solution of the problem used as the basis of the story. Entrants who are 
not familiar with science fiction should study GALAXY, available for 35c at most news- 
stands, or from 421 Hudson Street, New York 14, N. Y. 

All prize-winning stories will be printed in GALAXY. The first-prize story will also 
appear in The Humanist. For further information on the contest and literature describing 
the Humanist viewpoint, write to Humanist Story Contest, Yellow Springs, Ohio. 

- RULES OF THE CONTEST - 



• All entries must be between 2500 and 5000 
words in length. 

• Manuscripts must be typed in black, double- 
spaced, on plain white bond paper. The au- 
thor's name and address must appear on the 
manuscript itself. 

• There is no limit to the number of entries 
per student, but each must be accompanied 
by the following form or its equivalent: 

(Entrant's Name) 

(Name of College) 

Signed (Faculty Member) 

• Entries postmarked later than November 
30, 1954* cannot be accepted. 



• A stamped, self-addressed envelope must 
be included at the time of entry if the author 
wants his manuscript returned. 

• A ^MINIMUM first prize of $500 will be 
awarded as soon as judging is completed. 
An ADDITIONAL $250 will be paid by GAL- 
AXY if the prize-winning story is accompanied 
by a $3.50 subscription to GALAXY Magazine. 
This, however, will not have any bearing on 
the judging. 

• Other publishable stories will be purchased 
by GALAXY at 3c a word, with a $100 mini- 
mum purchase price. 

• Mail all entries to:

TAKE MY WORD 



TV" YORK or New York? Rxzl 
’ or Jones? Whether to pick 
current nomenclature or exotic 
place and personal names is one 
of the most vexing problems in 
writing science fiction. Hostile 
reviewers are fond of jibing at 
this vulnerable point. Instead of 
jibing right back at their erudite 
ignorance, I’ll simply prescribe 
The Story of Language by Mario 
Pei, published by Lippincott, 
for them. A good, hard look at 
this fine study — having been a re- 
viewer myself, I know that good, 
hard looks are rare in the breed 
— should indicate that language 
change is a legitimate field of 
speculation and the chance that 
today’s recognizable names will 
remain the same indefinitely is a 
bad betting proposition. 

Why, there is even an imposing 
term for the science — toponomy, 
the study of place names. The 
U. S. Department of the Interior 
has a bureau of linguists whose 
job is to hunt down the origins 
and meanings of the names of 
states, cities, mountains, rivers, 
lakes and so forth. It’s a rough 
task, for many of the names have 
come down in unrecognizable 
form and the meanings lost. 

According to Mr. Pei, Tennes- 
see is “the vines of the big bend,” 
Iowa “the sleepy ones,” Okla- 



homa “the red people,” Kansas 
“a breeze near the ground,” Mich- 
igan “fish-catching place,” Ken- 
tucky “the dark and bloody 
ground,” Illinois “the tribe of 
perfect men,” Texas “Friends!” 
and Idaho “good morning!” Chi- 
cago comes from the Piankashaw 
Indian Chi-Kak-Quwa, “place of 
skunk smells,” because wild 
onions grew there. 

Well, why not Nyork or even 
Nyawk? Look at what happened 
to Lugdunum, which is now 
Lyon; Cameracum and Medio- 
lanum, the latter meaning “in the 
middle of the plain,” time-ab- 
breviated to Cambrai and Milan. 
Caesarea Augusta became the 
Spanish Zaragoza; the first name 
(Caesarea) is now rendered in 
English and French as Jersey. 

If many names sound nonsen- 
sical in science fiction, they can’t 
approach reality for sheer in- 
credibility. I’ve already mention- 
ed Torpenhow Hill in England, 
each syllable of which has the 
same meaning, added by invad- 
ers or settlers, all translating to 
Hillhillhill Hill! Our Greenwich 
Village is almost as bad, for -wich 
is from the Latin vicus, meaning 
“village.” The Sicilian town of 
Linguaglossa is “tongue-tongue” 
in Latin and Greek. And imagine 
the disbelief of local Indians if 



4 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



they ever learned that their un- 
comprehending “What do you 
say?” to queries about the name 
of their country has come down 
to us as Yucatan! 

Given time, the origin of the 
town named Baseball, Ohio, is 
bound to be lost, perhaps even to 
linguists. The two communities 
of Basil and Baltimore decided to 
merge, with each contributing its 
first syllable to the joint mon- 
icker. 

If one thing is certain, it is 
that language shifts will make 
the most absurd-seeming invent- 
ed place names of science fiction, 
now ridiculed by reviewers who 
refuse to budge off the flypaper 
of the immediate moment, sound 
like timid guesses. Brimaquonx 
was once seriously suggested — 
and not in science fiction — as a 
name for New York that would 
combine those of all the boroughs. 
The future name may make that 
seem reasonable and even attrac- 
tive. 

For that matter, even in the 
present, how many of us would 
recognize the Chinese Mei Kuo 
as America or the Serbo-Croa- 
tian Zdedinjene Drzave as the 
United States? 

Personal names are not apt to 
fare better, especially when occu- 
pations, which have always been 
used as designations, change from 
our Smith, Baker, Miller and 
such to Jetman, Radar, Astronaut 



and Lord knows what else. 

To compound the confusion, 
nicknames have a nasty habit of 
becoming names. Remember 
Marcus Tullius? Certainly not. 
You know him as Cicero, Latin 
for “chickpea,” bestowed on him 
because of a wart on the nose! 

Don’t be surprised if Gimpy, 
Baldy, Red, Toots and the like 
become actual names. They have 
present-day equivalents in 
Claude (L., “lame”), Calvin (L., 
“bald”), Priscilla (L., “somewhat 
old”), Gretta (It., “petty”), 
Mona (Sp., “she-monkey”). 

Names can also be so truncat- 
ed that they bear no likeness 
whatever to their origins. Dino, 
a popular Italian name, is all that 
remains of Aldobrandino, Ger- 
manic for “old sword.” Ted, Ed, 
Bill, Jim and the rest have an 
equally good chance of surviving 
as full names. 

As for origins, industry is un- 
wittingly making a contribution. 
A number of Amazonian girls are 
called Frigidaire. And in Nyassa- 
land, Africa, the chief of a tribe 
took his name— Oxford Univer- 
sity Press — from a publisher’s 
catalogue. 

Rxzl, mentioned earlier, does 
sound unlikely because of its lack 
of vowels. But if the Yugoslavs 
can call Trieste Trst and “a hill 
full of fog” in Czech comes out 
vrch pin mlh, why not Rxzl?

A World 




of Talent 



By PHILIP K. DICK 

When two and two equal all or nothing, the 
total adds up to trouble — especially if the 
quantities you are dealing with are people! 



Illustrated by KOSSIN 

W HEN he entered the 
apartment, a great 
number of people were 
making noises and flashing col- 
ors. The sudden cacophony con- 
fused him. Aware of the surge of 
shapes, sounds, smells, three- 
dimensional oblique patches, but 
trying to peer through and be- 
yond, he halted at the door. With 
an act of will, he was able to clear

the blur somewhat; the meaning- 
less frenzy of human activity 
settled gradually into a quasi- 
orderly pattern. 

“What’s the matter?” his father 
asked sharply. 

“This is what we previewed 
a half-hour ago,” his mother said 
when the eight-year-old boy fail- 
ed to answer. “I wish you’d let 
me get a Corpsman to probe 
him.” 

“I don’t fully trust the Corps. 
And we have twelve years to 
handle this ourselves. If we 
haven’t cracked it by then — ” 

“Later.” She bent down and 
ordered in a crisp tone, “Go on 
in, Tim. Say hello to people.” 

“Try to hold an objective ori- 
entation,” his father added gent- 
ly. “At least for this evening, to 
the end of the party.” 

Tim passed silently through 
the crowded living room, ignor- 
ing the various oblique shapes, 
his body tilted forward, head 
turned to one side. Neither of his 
parents followed him; they were 
intercepted by the host and then 
surrounded by Norm and Psi 
guests. 

In the melee, the boy was for- 
gotten. He made a brief circuit 
of the living room, satisfied him- 
self that nothing existed there, 
and then sought a side hall. A 
mechanical attendant opened a 
bedroom door for him and he 
entered. 



■’T'HE bedroom was deserted; 

the party had only begun. He 
allowed the voices and movement 
behind him to fade into an indis- 
criminate blur. Faint perfumes of 
women drifted through \ the 
swank apartment, carried by the 
warm, Terranlike, artificial air 
pumped from the central ducts of 
the city. He raised himself up and 
inhaled the sweet scents, flowers, 
fruits, spices — and something 
more. 

He had to go all the way into 
the bedroom to isolate it. There 
it was — sour, like spoiled milk — 
the warning he counted on. And 
it was in the bedroom. 

Cautiously, he opened a closet. 
The mechanical selector tried to 
present him with clothing, but he 
ignored it. With the closet open, 
the scent was stronger. The Other 
was somewhere near the closet, if 
not actually in it. 

Under the bed? 

He crouched down and peered. 
Not there. He lay outstretched 
and stared under Fairchild’s 
metal work-desk, typical furni- 
ture of a Colonial official’s quar- 
ters. Here, the scent was stronger. 
Fear and excitement touched him. 
He jumped to his feet and push- 
ed the desk away from the 
smooth plastic surface of the 
wall. 

The Other clung against the 
wall in the dark shadows where 
the desk had rested. 



8

It was a Right Other, of course. 
He had only identified one Left 
and that for no more than a split 
second. The Other hadn’t man- 
aged to phase totally. He re- 
treated warily from it, conscious 
that, without his cooperation, it 
had come as far as it could. The 
Other watched him calmly, aware 
of his negative actions, but there 
was little it could do. It made no 
attempt to communicate, for that 
had always failed. 

T IM was safe. He halted and 
spent a long moment scrutin- 
izing . the Other. This was his 
chance to learn more about it. 
A space separated the two of 
them, across which only the 
visual image and odor — small 
vaporized particles — of the Other 
crossed. 

It was not possible to identify 
this Other; many were so similar, 
they appeared to be multiples of 
the same unit. But sometimes the 
Other was radically different. 
Was it possible that various selec- 
tions were being tried, alternate 
attempts to get across? 

Again the thought struck him. 
The people in the living room, 
both Norm and Psi classes — and 
even the Mute-class of which he 
was a part — seemed to have 
reached a workable stalemate 
with their own Others. It was 
strange, since their Lefts would 
be advanced over his own . 



unless the procession of Rights di- 
minished as the Left group in- 
creased. 

Was there a finite total of 
Others? 

He went back to the frenetic 
'living room. People murmured 
and swirled on all sides, gaudy 
opaque shapes everywhere, warm 
smells overpowering him with 
their closeness. It was clear that 
he would have to get informa- 
tion from his mother and father. 
He had already spun the research 
indices hooked to the Sol System 
educational transmission — spun 
them without results, since the 
circuit was not working. 

“Where did you wander off to?” 
his mother asked him, pausing 
in the animated conversation 
that had grown up among a 
group of Norm-class officials 
blocking one side of the room. 
She caught the expression on his 
face. 

“Oh,” she said. “Even here?” 

He was surprised at her ques- 
tion. Location made no differ- 
ence. Didn’t she know that? 
Floundering, he withdrew into 
himself to consider. He needed 
help; he couldn’t understand 
without outside assistance. But a 
staggering verbal block existed. 
Was it only a problem of ter- 
minology or was it more? 

As he wandered around the liv- 
ing room, the vague musty odor 
filtered to him through the heavy

curtain of people-smells. The 
Other was still there, crouched in 
the darkness where the desk had 
been, in the shadows of the de- 
serted bedroom. Waiting to come 
over. Waiting for him to take 
two more steps. 

J ULIE watched her eight-year- 
old son move away, an expres- 
sion of concern on her petite face. 
“We’ll have to keep our eyes on 
him,” she said to her husband. 
“I preview a mounting situation 
built around this thing of his.” 
Curt had caught it, too, but he 
kept on talking to the Norm-class 
officials grouped around the two 
Precogs. “What would you do,” 
he demanded, “if they really 
opened up on us? You know Big 
Noodle can’t handle a stepped-up 
shower of robot projectiles. The 
handful now and then are in the 
nature of experiments . and 
he has the half-hour warnings 
from Julie and me.” 

“True.” Fairchild scratched his 
gray nose, rubbed the stubble of 
beard showing below his lip. “But 
I don’t think they’ll swing to 
overt war operations. It would 
be an admission that we’re get- 
ting somewhere. It would legalize 
us and open things up. We might 
collect you Psi-class people to- 
gether and — ” he grinned wearily 
— “and think the Sol Systems 
far out past the Andromache Ne- 
bula.” 

10 



/'' 1 URT listened without resent- 
ment, since the man’s words 
were no surprise. As he and Julie 
had driven over, they had both 
previewed the party, its unfruit- 
ful discussions, the growing aber- 
rations of their son. His wife’s 
precog span was somewhat 
greater than his own. She was 
seeing, at this moment, ahead of 
his own vision. He wondered 
what the worried expression on 
her face indicated. 

“I’m afraid,” Julie said tight- 
ly, “that we’re going to have a 
little quarrel before we get home 
tonight.” 

Well, he had also seen that. 
“It’s the situation,” he said, re- 
jecting the topic. “Everybody 
here is on edge. It isn’t only you 
and I who’re going to be fight- 
ing.” 

Fairchild listened sympathetic- 
ally. “I can see some drawbacks 
to being a Precog. But knowing 
you’re going to have a spat, can’t 
you alter things before it begins?” 
“Sure,” Curt answered, “the 
way we give you pre-information 
and you use it to alter the situa- 
tion with Terra. But neither Julie 
nor I particularly care. It takes 
a huge mental effort to stave off 
something like this . and 
neither of us has that much 
energy.” 

“I just wish you’d let me turn 
him over to the Corps,” Julie 
said in a low voice. “I can’t stand 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



him wandering around, peering 
under things, looking in closets 
for God knows what!” 

“For Others,” Curt said. 
“Whatever that might be.” 
Fairchild, a natural-born mod- 
erator, tried intercession. “You’ve 
got twelve years,” he began. “It’s 
no disgrace to have Tim stay in 
the Mute-class; every one of you 
starts out that way. If he has Psi 
powers, he’ll show.” 

“You talk like an infinite Pre- 
cog,” Julie said, amused. “How 
do you know they’ll show?” 
Fairchild’s good-natured face 
twisted with effort. Curt felt sorry 
for him. Fairchild had too much 
responsibility, too many decisions 
to make, too many lives on his 
hands. Before the Separation with 
Terra, he had been an appointed 
official, a bureaucrat with a job 
and clearly defined routine. Now 
there was nobody to tap out an 
inter-system memo to him early 
Monday morning. Fairchild was 
working without instructions. 

“Let’s see that doodad of 
yours,” Curt said. “I’m curious 
about how it works.” 

Fairchild was astonished. “How 
the hell — ” Then he remembered. 
“Sure, you must have already 
previewed it.” He dug around in 
his coat. “I was going to make 
it the surprise of the party, but 
we can’t have surprises with you 
two Precogs around.” 

The other Norm-class officials 



crowded around as their boss un- 
wrapped a square of tissue paper 
and from it lifted a small glit- 
tering stone. An interested silence 
settled over the room as Fairchild 
examined the stone, his eyes close 
' to it, like a jeweler studying a 
precious gem. 

“An ingenious thing,” Curt ad- 
mitted. 

“Thanks,” Fairchild said. 
“They should start arriving any 
day, now. The glitter is to attract 
children and lower-class people 
who would go out for a bauble — 
possible wealth, you know. And 
women, of course. Anybody who 
would stop and pick up what they 
thought was a diamond, every- 
body but the Tech-classes. I’ll 
show you.” 

H E glanced around the hushed 
living room at the guests in 
their gay party clothes. Off to 
one side, Tim stood with his head 
turned at an angle. Fairchild hes- 
itated, then tossed the stone 
across the carpet in front of the 
boy, almost at his feet. The boy’s 
eyes didn’t flicker. He was gazing 
absently through the people, un- 
aware of the bright object at his 
feet. 

Curt moved forward, ready to 
take up the social slack. “You’d 
have to produce something the 
size of a jet transport.” He bent 
down and retrieved the stone. 
“It’s not your fault that Tim 



A WORLD OF TALENT

doesn’t respond to such mundane 
things as fifty-carat diamonds.” 

Fairchild was crestfallen at the 
collapse of his demonstration. “I 
forgot.” He brightened. “But 
there aren’t any Mutes on Terra 
any more. Listen and see what 
you think of the spiel. I had a 
hand at writing it.” 

TN Curt’s hand, the stone rested 
coldly. In his ears, a tiny 
gnatlike buzz sounded, a con- 
trolled, modulated cadence that 
caused a stir of murmurs around 
the room. 

“My friends,” the canned voice 
stated, “the causes of the conflict 
between Terra and the Centaur - 
ian colonies have been grossly 
misstated in the press.” 

“Is this seriously aimed at 
children?” Julie asked. 

“Maybe he thinks Terran chil- 
dren are advanced over our own,” 
a Psi-class official said as a rustle 
of amusement drifted through 
the room. 

The tinny whine droned on, 
turning out its mixture of legal- 
istic arguments, idealism and an 
almost pathetic pleading. The 
begging quality grated on Curt. 
Why did Fairchild have to get 
down on his knees and plead with 
the Terrans? As he listened, Fair- 
child puffed confidently on his 
pipe, arms folded, heavy face 
thick with satisfaction. Evidently 
Fairchild wasn’t aware of the 



precarious thinness of his canned 
words. 

It occurred to Curt that none 
of them — including himself — was 
facing how really fragile their 
Separation movement was. There 
was no use blaming the weak 
words wheezing from the pseudo- 
gem. Any description of their po- 
sition was bound to reflect the 
querulous half-fear that domin- 
ated the Colonies. 

“It has long been established,” 
the stone asserted, “that freedom 
is the natural condition of Man. 
Servitude, the bondage of one 
man or one group of men to 
another, is a remnant of the past, 
a vicious anachronism. Men must 
govern themselves.” 

“Strange to hear a stone saying 
that,” Julie said, half-amused. 
“An inert lump of rock.” 

“You have been told that the 
Colonial Secessionist movement 
will jeopardize your System, your 
lives and your standard of living. 
This is not true. The standard of 
living of all mankind will be rais- 
ed if the colony planets are al- 
lowed to govern themselves and 
find their own economic markets. 
The mercantile system practiced 
by the Terran government on 
Terrans living outside the Sol 
group — ” 

“The children will bring this 
thing home,” Fairchild said. 
“The parents will pick it up from 
them.”

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



T HE stone droned on. “The 
Colonies could not remain 
mere supply bases for Terra, 
sources of raw materials and 
cheap labor. The Colonists could 
not remain second-class citizens. 
Colonists have as much right to 
determine their own society as 
those remaining in the Sol group. 
Thus, the Colonial Government 
has petitioned the Terran Gov- 
ernment for a severance of those 
bonds to keep us from realizing 
our manifest destinies.” 

Curt and Julie exchanged 
glances. The academic textbook 
dissertation hung like a dead 
weight in the room. Was this the 
man the Colony had elected to 
manage the resistance move- 
ment? A pedant, a salaried offi- 
cial, a bureaucrat and — Curt 
couldn’t help thinking — a man 
without Psi powers. A Normal. 

Fairchild had probably been 
moved to break with Terra over 
some trivial miswording of a 
routine directive. Nobody, except 
perhaps the telepathic Corps, 
knew his motives or how long he 
could keep going. 

“What do you think of it?” 
Fairchild asked when the stone 
had finished its monologue and 
had started over. “Millions of 
them showering down all over the 
Sol group. You know what the 
Terran press is saying about us 
— vicious lies — that we want to 
take over Sol, that we’re hideous 



invaders from outer space, mon- 
sters, mutants, freaks. We have 
to counter such propaganda.” 

“Well,” Julie said, “a third of 
us are freaks, so why not face it? 
I know my son is a useless freak.” 

Curt took her arm. “Nobody’s 
calling Tim a freak, not even 
you!” 

“But it’s true!” She pulled 
away. “If we were back in the 
Sol System — if we hadn’t sepa- 
rated — you and I would be in 
detention camps, waiting to be 
— you know.” She fiercely jabbed 
in the direction of their son. 
“There wouldn’t be any Tim.” 

From the corner a sharp-faced 
man spoke up. “We wouldn’t be 
in the Sol System. We’d have 
broken out on our own without 
anybody’s help. Fairchild had 
nothing to do with it; we brought 
him along. Don’t ever forget 
that!” 

Curt eyed the man hostilely. 
Reynolds, chief of the telepathic 
Corps, was drunk again. Drunk 
and spilling over his load of 
vitriolic hate for Norms. 

“Possibly,” Curt agreed, “but 
we would have had a hell of a 
time doing it.” 

“You and I know what keeps 
this Colony alive,” Reynolds an- 
swered, his flushed face arrogant 
and sneering. “How long could 
these bureaucrats keep on going 
without Big Noodle and Sally, 
you two Precogs, the Corps and

all the rest of us? Face facts — 
we don’t need this legalistic win- 
dow-dressing. We’re not going to 
win because of any pious appeals 
for freedom and equality. We’re 
going to win because there are no 
Psis on Terra.” 

r | ''HE geniality of the room 
dwindled. Angry murmurs 
rose from the Norm-class guests. 

“Look here,” Fairchild said to 
Reynolds, “you’re still a human 
being, even if you can read minds. 
Having a talent doesn’t — ” 

“Don’t lecture me,” Reynolds 
said. “No numbskull is going to 
tell me what to do.” 

“You’re going too far,” Curt 
told Reynolds. “Somebody’s go- 
ing to smack you down some 
day. If Fairchild doesn’t do it, 
maybe I will.” 

“You and your meddling 

Corps,” a Psi-class Resurrector 
said to Reynolds, grabbing hold 
of his collar. “You think you’re 
above us because you can merge 
your minds. You think — ” 

“Take your hands off me,” 

Reynolds said in an ugly voice. 

A glass crashed to the floor; one 

of the women became hysterical. 
Two men struggled; a third join- 
ed and, in a flash, a wild turmoil 
of resentment was boiling in the 
center of the room. 

Fairchild shouted for order. 
“For God’s sake, if we fight each 
other, we’re finished. Don’t you 



understand — we have to work 
together!” 

It took a while before the up- 
roar subsided. Reynolds pushed 
past Curt, white-faced and mut- 
tering under his breath. “I’m get- 
ting out of here.” The other 
Telepaths trailed belligerently af- 
ter him. 

AS he and Julie drove slowly 
home through the bluish 
darkness, one section of Fair- 
child’s propaganda repeated it- 
self in Curt’s brain over and over 
again. 

“You’ve been told a victory by 
the Colonists means a victory of 
Psis over Normal human beings. 
This is not true! The Separation 
was not planned and is not con- 
ducted by either Psis or Mutants. 
The revolt was a spontaneous re- 
action by Colonists of all classes.” 
“I wonder,” Curt mused. 
“Maybe Fairchild’s wrong. May- 
be he’s being operated by 
Psis without knowing it. Person- 
ally, I like him, stupid as he is.” 
“Yes, he’s stupid,” Julie agreed. 
In the darkness of the car’s cabin, 
her cigarette was a bright burn- 
ing coal of wrath. In the back 
seat, Tim lay curled up asleep, 
warmed by the heat from the 
motor. The barren, rocky land- 
scape of Proxima III rolled out 
ahead of the small surface-car, 
a dim expanse, hostile and alien. 
A few Man-made roads and 



14

buildings lay here and there 
among crop-tanks and fields. 

“I don’t trust Reynolds,” Curt 
continued, knowing he was open- 
ing the previewed scene between 
them, yet not willing to sidestep 
it. “Reynolds is smart, unscrupu- 
lous and ambitious. What he 
wants is prestige and status. But 
Fairchild is thinking of the wel- 
fare of the Colony. He means all 
that stuff he dictated into his 
stones.” 

“That drivel,” Julie was scorn- 
ful. “The, Terrans will laugh 
their heads off. Listening to it 
with a straight face was more 
than I could manage, and God 
knows our lives depend on this 
business.” 

“Well,” Curt said carefully, 
knowing what he was getting in- 
to, “there may be Terrans with 
more sense of justice than you 
and Reynolds.” He turned to- 
ward her. “I can see what you’re 
going to do and so can you. May- 
be you’re right, maybe we ought 
to get it over with. Ten years is 
a long time when there’s no 
feeling. And it wasn’t our idea in 
the first place.” 

“No,” Julie agreed. She crush- 
ed her cigarette out and shakily 
lit another. “If there had been 
another male Precog besides you, 
just one. That’s something I can’t 
forgive Reynolds for. It was his 
idea, you know. I never should 
have agreed. For the glory of the 



race! Onward and upward with 
the Psi banner! The mystical 
mating of the first real Precogs 
in history . and look what 
came of it!” 

“Shut up,” Curt said. “He’s not 
asleep and he can hear you.” 

J ULIE’S voice was bitter. 

“Hear me, yes. Understand, 
no. We wanted to know what the 
second generation would be like 
-.-well, now we know. Precog 
plus Precog equal freak. Use- 
less mutant. Monster — let’s face 
it, the M on his card stands for 
monster.” 

Curt’s hands tightened on the 
wheel. “That’s a word neither you 
nor anybody else is going to use.” 
“Monster!” She leaned close 
to him, teeth white in the light 
from the dashboard, eyes glow- 
ing. “Maybe the Terrans are right 
— maybe we Precogs ought to be 
sterilized and put to death. Eras- 
ed. I think . .” She broke off 
abruptly, unwilling to finish. 

“Go ahead,”. Curt said. “You 
think perhaps when the revolt 
is successful and we’re in control 
of the Colonies, we should go 
down the line selectively. With 
the Corps on top naturally.” 
“Separate the wheat from the 
chaff,” Julie said. “First the Col- 
onies from Terra. Then us from 
them. And when he comes up, 
even if he is my son . .” 

“What you’re doing,” Curt 



A WORLD OF TALENT

interrupted, “is passing judgment 
on people according to their use. 
Tim isn’t useful, so there’s no 
point in letting him live, right?” 
His blood pressure was on the 
way up, but he was past caring. 
“Breeding people like cattle. A 
human hasn’t a right to live; 
that’s a privilege we dole out ac- 
cording to our whim.” 

Curt raced the car down the 
deserted highway. “You heard 
Fairchild prattle about freedom 
and equality. He believes it and 
so do I. And I believe Tim — or 
anybody else — has a right to exist 
whether we can make use of his 
talent or whether he even has a 
talent.” 

“He has a right to live,” Julie 
said, “but remember he’s not 
one of us. He’s an oddity. He 
doesn’t have our ability, our — ” 
she ground out the words trium- 
phantly — “superior ability.” 

Curt pulled the car over to the 
edge of the highway. He brought 
it to a halt and pushed open the 
door. Dismal, arid air billowed 
into the car. 

“You drive on home.” He lean- 
ed over the back seat and prod- 
ded Tim into wakefulness. “Come 
on, kid. We’re getting out.” 

Julie reached over to get the 
wheel. “When will you be home? 
Or have you got it completely set 
up now? Better make sure. She 
might be the kind that has a few 
others on the string.” 



Curt stepped from the car and 
the door slammed behind him. He 
took his son’s hand and led him 
down the roadway to the black 
square of a ramp that rose dark- 
ly in the night gloom. As they 
started up the steps, he heard the 
car roar off down the highway, 
through the darkness toward 
home. 

“Where are we?” Tim asked. 

“You know this place. I bring 
you here every week. This is the 
school where they train people 
like you and me — where we Psis 
get our education.” 

II 

T IGHTS came on around 
them. Corridors branched off 
the main entrance ramp like 
metal vines. 

“You may stay here for a few 
days,” Curt said to his son. “Can 
you stand not seeing your mother 
for a while?” 

Tim didn’t answer. He had 
lapsed back into his usual silence 
as he followed along beside his 
father. Curt again wondered how 
the boy could be so withdrawn — 
as he obviously was — and yet be 
so terribly alert. The answer was 
written over each inch of the taut, 
young body. Tim was only with- 
drawn from contact with human 
beings. He maintained an almost 
compulsive tangency with the 
outside world — or, rather, an out- 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



side world. Whatever it was, it 
didn’t include humans, although 
it was made up of real, external 
objects. 

As he had already previewed, 
his son suddenly broke away 
from him. Curt let the boy hurry 
down a side corridor. He watched 
as Tim stood tugging anxiously 
at a supply locker, trying to get 
it open. 

“Okay,” Curt said resignedly. 
He followed after him and un- 
locked the locker with his pass 
key. “See? There’s nothing in it.” 

How completely the boy lack- 
ed precog could be seen by the 
flood of relief that swept his face. 
Curt’s heart sank at the sight. 
The precious talent that both he 
and Julie possessed simply had- 
n’t been passed on. Whatever the 
boy was, he was not a Precog. 

It was past two in the morning, 
but the interior departments of 
the School Building were alight 
with activity. Curt moodily greet- 
ed a couple of Corpsmen loung- 
ing around the bar, surrounded 
by beers and ashtrays. 

“Where’s Sally?” he demand- 
ed. “I want to go in and see Big 
Noodle.” 

One of the Telepaths lazily 
jerked a thumb. “She’s around 
somewhere. Over that way, in the 
kids’ quarters, probably asleep. 
It’s late.” He eyed Curt, whose 
thoughts were on Julie. “You 
ought to get rid of a wife like 



that. She’s too old and thin, any- 
how. What you’d really like is a 
plump young dish — ” 

Curt lashed a blast of mental 
dislike and was satisfied to see 
the grinning young face go hard 
with antagonism. The other Tele- 
path pulled himself upright and 
shouted after Curt, “When you’re 
through with your wife, send her 
around to us.” 

“I’d say you’re after a girl of 
about twenty,” another Tele- 
path said as he admitted Curt 
to the sleeping quarters of the 
children’s wing. “Dark hair — cor- 
rect me if I’m wrong — and dark 
eyes. You have a fully formed 
image. Maybe there’s a specific 
girl. Let’s see, she’s short, fairly 
pretty and her name is — ” 

Curt cursed at the situation 
that required them to turn their 
minds over to the Corps. Tele- 
paths were interlaced through- 
out the Colonies and, in particu- 
lar, throughout the School and 
the offices of the Colonial Gov- 
ernment. He tightened his grip 
around Tim’s hand and led him 
through the doorway. 

“This kid of yours,” the Tele- 
path said as Tim passed close to 
him, “sure probes queer. Mind if 
I go down a little?” 

“Keep out of his mind!” Curt 
ordered sharply. He slammed the 
door shut after Tim, knowing it 
made no difference, but enjoying 
the feel of the heavy metal slid-

ing in place. He pushed Tim 
down a narrow corridor and into 
a small room. Tim pulled away, 
intent on a side door; Curt sav- 
agely yanked him back. “There’s 
nothing in there!” he reprimand- 
ed harshly. “That’s only a bath- 
room.” 

Tim continued to tug away. 
He was still tugging when Sally 
appeared, fastening a robe 
around her, face puffy with sleep. 
“Hello, Mr. Purcell,” she greet- 
ed Curt. “Hello, Tim.” Yawning, 
she turned on a floor lamp and 
tossed herself down on a chair. 
“What can I do for you this time 
of night?” 

CHE was thirteen, tall and 
^ gangling, with yellow corn- 
silk hair and freckled skin. She 
picked sleepily at her thumbnail 
and yawned again as the boy sat 
down across from her. To amuse 
him, she animated a pair of gloves 
lying on a sidetable. Tim laughed 
with delight as the gloves groped 
their way to the edge of the 
table, waved their fingers blindly 
and began a cautious descent to 
the floor. 

“Fine,” Curt said. “You’re get- 
ting good. I’d say you’re not cut- 
ting any classes.” 

Sally shrugged. “Mr. Purcell, 
the School can’t teach me any- 
thing. You know I’m the most 
advanced Psi with the power of 
animation. They just let me work 



alone. In fact, I’m instructing a 
bunch of little kids, still Mutes, 
who might have something. I 
think a couple of them could 
work out, with practice. All they 
can give me is encouragement; 
you know, psychological stuff 
and lots of vitamins and fresh 
air. But they can’t teach me any- 
thing.” 

“They can teach you how im- 
portant you are,” Curt said. He 
had previewed this, of course. 
During the last half hour, he had 
selected a number of possible ap- 
proaches, discarded one after an- 
other, finally ended with this. “I 
came over to see Big Noodle. 
That meant I had to wake you. 
Do you know why?” 

“Sure,” Sally answered. 
“You’re afraid of him. And since 
Big Noodle is afraid of me, you 
need me to come along.” She 
allowed the gloves to sag back 
into immobility as she got to her 
feet. “Well, let’s go.” 

He had seen Big Noodle many 
times in his life, but he had never 
got used to the sight. Awed, in 
spite of his preview of this scene, 
Curt stood in the open space be- 
fore the platform, gazing up, 
silent and impressed as always. 

“He’s fat,” Sally said practic- 
ally. “If he doesn’t get thinner, he 
won’t live long.” 

Big Noodle slumped like a 
gray, sickly pudding in the im- 
mense chair the Tech Depart- 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ment had built for him. His eyes 
were half-closed; his pulpy arms 
lay slack and inert at his sides. 
Wads of oozing dough hung in 
folds over the arms and sides of 
the chair. Big Noodle’s egglike 
skull was fringed with damp, 
stringy hair, matted like decayed 
seaweed. His nails were lost in 
the sausage fingers. His teeth 
were rotting and black. His tiny 
plate-blue eyes flickered dully as 
he identified Curt and Sally, but 
the obese body did not stir. 

“He’s resting,” Sally explained. 
“He just ate.” 

“Hello,” Curt said. 

From the swollen mouth, be- 
tween rolls of pink flesh lips, a 
grumbled response came. 

“He doesn’t like to be bother- 
ed this late,” Sally said yawning. 
“I don’t blame him.” 

S HE wandered around the 
room, amusing herself by ani- 
mating light brackets along the 
wall. The brackets struggled to 
pull free from the hot-pour plas- 
tic in which they were set. 

“This seems so dumb, if you 
don’t mind my saying so, Mr. 
Purcell. The Telepaths keep Ter- 
ran infiltrators from coming in 
here, and all this business of 
yours is against them. That 
means you’re helping Terra, 
doesn’t it? If we didn’t have the 
Corps to watch out for us — ” 

“I keep out Terrans,” Big 



Noodle mumbled. “I have my 
wall and I turn back everything.” 

“You turn back projectiles,” 
Sally said, “but you can’t keep 
out infiltrators. A Terran infiltra- 
tor could come in here this min- 
ute and you wouldn’t know. 
You’re just a big stupid lump of 
lard.” 

Her description was accurate. 
But the vast mound of fat was the 
nexus of the Colony’s defense, the 
most talented of the Psis. Big 
Noodle was the core of the Sepa- 
ration movement . and the 
living symbol of its problem. 

Big Noodle had almost infinite 
parakinetic power and the mind 
of a moronic three-year-old. He 
was, specifically, an idiot savant. 
His legendary powers had ab- 
sorbed his whole personality, 
withered and degenerated it, 
rather than expanded -it. He 
could have swept the Colony 
aside years ago if his bodily lusts 
hnd fears had been accompanied 
by cunning. But Big Noodle was 
helpless and inert, totally de- 
pendent on the instructions of the 
Colonial Government, reduced to 
sullen passivity by his terror of 
Sally. 

“I ate a whole pig.” Big Noodle 
struggled to a quasi-sitting posi- 
tion, belched, wiped feebly at his 
chin. “Two pigs, in fact. Right 
here in this room, just a little 
while ago. I could get more if I 
wanted.” 



A WORLD OF TALENT 



19 



The diet of the colonists con- 
sisted mainly of tank-grown arti- 
ficial protein. Big Noodle was 
amusing himself at their expense. 

“The pig,” Big Noodle con- 
tinued grandly, “came from Ter- 
ra. The night before, I had a 
flock of wild ducks. And before 
that, I brought over some kind 
of animal from Betelgeuse IV. It 
doesn’t have any name; it just 
runs around and eats.” 

“Like you,” Sally said. “Only 
you don’t run around.” 

Big Noodle giggled. Pride mo- 
mentarily overcame his fear of 
the girl. “Have some candy,” he 
offered. A shower of chocolate 
rattled down like hail. Curt and 
Sally retreated as the floor of the 
chamber disappeared under the 
deluge. With the chocolate came 
fragments of machinery, card- 
board boxes, sections of display 
counter, a jagged chunk of con- 
crete floor. “Candy factory on 
Terra,” Big Noodle explained 
happily. “I’ve got it pinpointed 
pretty good.” 

Tim had awakened from his 
contemplation. He bent down 
and eagerly picked up a hand- 
ful of chocolates. 

“Go ahead,” Curt said to him. 
“You might as well take them.” 
“I’m the only one that gets 
the candy,” Big Noodle thunder- 
ed, outraged. The chocolate van- 
ished. “I sent it back,” he ex- 
plained peevishly. “It’s mine.”

r ■''HERE was nothing malevo- 
-*• lent in Big Noodle, only an 
infinite childish selfishness. 
Through his power, every object 
in the Universe had become his 
possession. There was nothing 
outside the reach of his bloated 
arms; he could reach for the 
Moon and get it. Fortunately, 
most things were outside his span 
of comprehension. He was unin- 
terested. 

“Let’s cut out these games,” 
Curt said. “Can you say if any 
Telepaths are within probe range 
of us?” 

Big Noodle made a begrudging 
search. He had a consciousness 
of objects wherever they were. 
Through his talent, he was in 
contact with the physical con- 
tents of the Universe. 

“None near here,” he declared 
after a time. “One about a hun- 
dred feet off . I’ll move him 
back. I hate Teeps getting into 
my privacy.” 

“Everybody hates Teeps,” Sal- 
ly said. “It’s a nasty, dirty talent. 
Looking into other people’s minds 
is like watching them when 
they’re bathing or dressing or eat- 
ing. It isn’t natural.” 

Curt grinned. “Is it any dif- 
ferent from Precog? You wouldn’t 
call that natural.” 

“Precog has to do with events, 
not people,” Sally said. “Know- 
ing what’s going to happen isn’t 
any worse than knowing what’s 



already happened.” 

“It might even be better,” Curt 
pointed out. 

“No,” Sally said emphatically. 
“It’s got us into this trouble. I 
have to watch what I think all 
the time because of you. Every 
time I see a Teep, I get goose 
bumps, and no matter how hard 
I try, I can’t keep from thinking 
about her, just because I know 
I’m not supposed to.” 

“My precog faculty has noth- 
ing to do with Pat,” Curt said. 
“Precog doesn’t introduce fatal- 
ity. Locating Pat was an intricate 
job. It was a deliberate choice 
I made.” 

“Aren’t you sorry?” Sally de- 
manded. 

“No.” 

“If it wasn’t for me,” Big 
Noodle interrupted, “you never 
would have got across to Pat.” 

“I wish we hadn’t,” Sally said 
fervently. “If it wasn’t for Pat, 
we wouldn’t be mixed up in all 
this business.” She shot a hostile 
glance at Curt. “And I don’t 
think she’s pretty.” 

“What would you suggest?” 
Curt asked the child with more 
patience than he felt. He had pre- 
viewed the futility of making a 
child and an idiot understand 
about Pat. “You know we can’t 
pretend we never found her.” 

“I know,” Sally admitted. 
“And the Teeps have got some- 
thing from our minds already. 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



That’s why there’re so many of 
them hanging around here. It’s 
a good thing we don’t know where 
she is.” 

“I know where she is,” Big 
Noodle said. “I know exactly 
where.” 

“No, you don’t,” Sally an- 
swered. “You just know how to 
get to her and that’s not the same 
thing. You can’t explain it; you 
just send us over there and back.” 

“TT’S a planet,” Big Noodle 
said angrily, “with funny 
plants and a lot of green things. 
And the air’s thin. She lives in a 
camp. People go out and farm all 
day. There’s only a few people 
there. A lot of dopy animals live 
there. It’s cold.” 

“Where is it?” Curt asked. 

Big Noodle sputtered. “It’s 
. .” His pulpy arms waved. “It’s 
some place near . .” He gave 
up, wheezed resentfully at Sally 
and then brought a tank of filthy 
water into being above the girl’s 
head. As the water flowed toward 
her, the child made a few brief 
motions with her hands. 

Big Noodle shrieked in terror 
and the water vanished. He lay 
panting with fright, body quiver- 
ing, as Sally mopped at a wet 
spot on her robe. She had ani- 
mated the fingers of his left hand. 

“Better not do that again,” 
Curt said to her. “His heart might 
give out.” 



“The big slob.” Sally rummag- 
ed around in a supply closet. 
“Well, if you’ve made up your 
mind, we might as well get it 
over with. Only let’s not stay so 
long. You get to talking with Pat 
and then the two of you go off, 
and you don’t come back for 
hours. At night, it’s freezing and 
they don’t have any heating 
plants.” She pulled down a coat 
from the closet. “I’ll take this 
with me.” 

“We’re not going,” Curt told 
her. “This time is going to be 
different.” 

Sally blinked. “Different? 
How?” 

Even Big Noodle was surpris- 
ed. “I was just getting ready to 
move you across,” he complained. 

“I know,” Curt said firmly. 
“But this time I want you to 
bring Pat here. Bring her to this 
room, understand? This is the 
time we’ve been talking about. 
The big moment’s arrived.” 

T HERE was only one person 
with Curt as he entered Fair- 
child’s office. Sally was now in 
bed, back at the school. Big 
Noodle never stirred from his 
chamber. Tim was still at the 
School, in the hands of Psi-class 
authorities, not Telepaths. 

Pat followed hesitantly, fright- 
ened and nervous as the men sit- 
ting around the office glanced up 
in annoyance. 



A WORLD OF TALENT

She was perhaps nineteen, slim 
and copper-skinned, with large 
dark eyes. She wore a canvas 
workshirt and jeans, heavy shoes 
caked with mud. Her tangle of 
black curls was tied back and 
knotted with a red bandanna. Her 
rolled-up sleeves showed tanned, 
competent arms. At her leather 
belt she carried a knife, a field 
telephone and an emergency pack 
of rations and water. 

“This is the girl,” Curt said. 
“Take a good look at her.” 
“Where are you from?” Fair- 
child asked Pat. He pushed aside 
a heap of directives and memo- 
tapes to find his pipe. 

Pat hesitated. “I — ” she be- 
gan. She turned uncertainly to 
Curt. “You told me never to say, 
even to you.” 

“It’s okay,” Curt said gently. 
“You can tell us now.” He ex- 
plained to Fairchild, “I can pre- 
view what she’s going to say, 
but I never knew before. I did- 
n’t want to get it probed out of 
me by the Corps.” 

“I was born on Proxima VI,” 
Pat said in a low voice. “I grew 
up there. This is the first time 
I’ve left the planet.” 

Fairchild’s eyes widened. 
“That’s a wild place. In fact, 
about our most primitive region.” 
Around the office, his group of 
Norm and Psi consultants moved 
closer to watch. One wide-shoul- 
dered old man, face weathered as 



stone, eyes shrewd and alert, rais- 
ed his hand. “Are we to under- 
stand that Big Noodle brought 
you here?” 

Pat nodded. “I didn’t know. I 
mean it was unexpected.” She 
tapped her belt. “I was work- 
ing, clearing the brush . we’ve 
been trying to expand, develop 
more usable land.” 

“What’s your name?” Fair- 
child asked her. 

“Patricia Ann Connley.” 
“What class?” 

The girl’s sun-cracked lips 
moved. “Mute-class.” 

A stir moved through the of- 
ficials. “You’re a Mutant,” the 
old man asked her, “without Psi 
powers? Exactly how do you dif- 
fer from the Norm?” 

TJAT glanced at Curt and he 
moved forward to answer for 
her. “This girl will be twenty-one 
in two years. You know what that 
means. If she’s still in the Mute- 
class, she’ll be sterilized and put 
in a camp. That’s our Colonial 
policy. And if Terra whips us, 
she’ll be sterilized in any case, as 
will all of us Psis and Mutants.” 
“Are you trying to say she has 
a talent?” Fairchild asked. “You 
want us to lift her from Mute to 
Psi?” His hands fumbled at the 
papers on the table. “We get a 
thousand petitions a day like this. 
You came down here at four in 
the morning just for this? There’s 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a routine form you can fill out, 
a common office procedure.” 
The old man cleared his throat 
and blurted, “This girl is close 
to you?” 

“That’s right,” Curt said. “I 
have a personal interest.” 

“How did you meet her?” the 
old man asked. “If she’s never 
been off Proxima VI . .” 

“Big Noodle shuttled me there 
and back,” Curt answered. “I’ve 
made the trip about twenty times. 
I didn’t know it was Prox VI, of 
course. I only knew it was a 
Colony planet, primitive, still 
wild. Originally, I came across an 
analysis of her personality and 
neural characteristics in our 
Mute-class files. As soon as I 
understood, I gave Big Noodle 
the identifying brain pattern and 
had him send me across.” 

“What is that pattern?” Fair- 
child asked. “What’s different 
about her?” 

“Pat’s talent has never been 
acknowledged as Psi,” Curt said. 
“In a way, it isn’t, but it’s go- 
ing to be one of the most useful 
talents we’ve discovered. We 
should have known it would 
arise. Wherever some organism 
develops, so does another to prey 
on it.” 

“Get to the point,” Fairchild 
said. He rubbed the blue stubble 
of his chin. “When you called 
me, all you said was that — ” 
“Consider the various Psi tal- 

A WORLD OF TALENT 



ents as survival weapons,” Curt 
said. “Consider telepathic ability 
as evolving for the defense of an 
organism. It puts the Telepath 
head and shoulders above his 
enemies. Is this going to con- 
tinue? Don't these things usually 
balance out?” 

It was the old man who un- 
derstood. “I see,” he said with 
a grin of wry admiration. “This 
girl is opaque to telepathic 
probes.” 

“That’s right,” Curt said. “The 
first, but there’ll most likely be 
others. And not only defenses to 
telepathic probes. There are going 
to be organisms resistant to Para- 
kineticists, to Precogs like my- 
self, to Resurrectors, to Anima- 
tors, to every and all Psi powers. 
Now we have a fourth class. The 
Anti-Psi class. It was bound to 
come .into existence.” 

Hi 

ITTHE coffee was artificial, but 
hot and satisfying. Like the 
eggs and bacon it was synthetic- 
ally compounded from tank- 
grown meals and proteins, with 
a carefully regulated mix of na- 
tive-grown plant fiber. As they 
ate, the morning sun rose outside. 
The barren gray landscape of 
Proxima III was touched with a 
faint tint of red. 

“It looks nice,” Pat said shyly, 
glancing out the kitchen window. 

25 



“Maybe I can examine your 
farming equipment. You have a 
lot we don’t have.” 

“We’ve had more time,” Curt 
reminded her. “This planet was 
settled a century before your 
own. You’ll catch up with us. In 
many ways Prox VI is richer 
' and more fertile.” 

Julie wasn’t sitting at the table. 
She stood leaning against the re- 
frigerator, arms folded, her face 
hard and frigid. “Is she really 
staying here?” she demanded in 
a thin, clipped voice. “In this 
house with us?” 

“That’s right,” Curt answered. 
“How long?” 

“A few days. A week. Until I 
can get Fairchild moving.” 

Faint sounds stirred beyond the 
house. Here and there in the resi- 
dential syndrome people were 
waking up and preparing for the 
day. The kitchen was warm and 
cheerful; a window of clear plas- 
tic separated it from the land- 
scape of tumbled rocks, thin trees 
and plants that stretched to a 
line of weathered mountains a 
few hundred miles off. Cold 
morning wind whipped around 
the rubbish that littered the de- 
serted inter-system field at the 
rim of the syndrome. 

“That field was - the link be- 
tween us and the Sol System,” 
Curt said. “The umbilical cord. 
Gone now, for a while at least.” 
“It’s beautiful,” Pat stated. 



“The field?” 

She gestured at the towers of 
an elaborate mining and smelting 
combine partly visible beyond the 
rows of houses. “Those, I mean. 
The landscape is like ours; bleak 
and awful. It’s all the installa- 
tions that mean something . 
where you’ve pushed the land- 
scape back.” She shivered. 
“We’ve been fighting trees and 
rocks all my life, trying to get the 
soil usable, trying to make a 
place to live. We don’t have 
any heavy equipment on Prox VI, 
just hand tools and our own 
backs. You know, you’ve seen 
our villages.” 

Curt sipped his coffee. “Are 
there many Psis on Prox VI?” 

“A few. Mostly minor. A few 
Resurrectors, a handful of Ani- 
mators. No one even as good as 
Sally.” She laughed, showing her 
even white teeth. “We’re rustic 
hicks, compared to this urban 
metropolis. You saw how we live. 
Villages stuck here and there, 
farms, a few isolated supply cen- 
ters, one miserable field. You saw 
my family, my brothers and my 
father, our home life, if you can 
call that log shack a home. Three 
centuries behind Terra.” 

“They taught you about Ter- 
ra?” 

“Oh, yes. Tapes came direct 
from the Sol System until the 
Separation. Not that I’m sorry 
we separated. We should have 



26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



been out working anyhow, in- 
stead of watching the tapes. But 
it was interesting to see the 
mother world, the big cities, all 
the billions of people. And the 
earlier colonies on Venus and 
Mars. It was amazing.” Her 
voice throbbed with excitement. 
“Those colonies were like ours, 
once. They had to clear Mars 
the same way we’re clearing Prox 
VI. We’ll get Prox VI cleared, 
cities built up and fields laid out. 
And we’ll all go on doing our 
part.” 

J ULIE detached herself from 
the refrigerator and began 
gathering dishes from the table 
without looking at Pat. “Maybe 
I’m being naive,” she said to 
Curt, “but where’s she going to 
sleep?” 

“You know the answer,” Curt 
answered patiently. “You’ve pre- 
viewed all this. Tim’s at the 
School so she can have his room.” 
“What am I supposed to do? 
Feed her, wait on her, be her 
maid? What am I supposed to 
tell people when they see her?” 
Julie’s voice rose to a shrill. 
“Am I supposed to say she’s my 
sister?” 

Pat smiled across at Curt, toy- 
ing with a button on her shirt. 
It was apparent that she was un- 
touched, remote from Julie’s 
harsh voice. Probably that was 
why the Corps couldn’t probe 

A WORLD OF TALENT 



her. Detached, almost aloof, she 
seemed unaffected by rancor and 
violence. 

“She won’t need any supervi- 
sion,” Curt said to his wife. 
“Leave her alone.” 

Julie lit a cigarette with rapid, 
jerky fingers. “I’ll be glad to 
leave her alone. But she can’t go 
around in those work clothes 
looking like a convict.” 

“Find her something of yours,” 
Curt suggested. 

Julie’s face twisted. “She 
couldn’t wear my things; she’s 
too heavy.” To Pat she said with 
deliberate cruelty, “What are 
you, about a size 30 waist? My 
God, what have you been doing, 
dragging a plow? Look at her 
neck and shoulders . she looks 
like a field-horse.” 

Curt got abruptly to his feet 
and pushed his chair back from 
the table. “Come on,” he said to 
Pat. It was vital to show her 
something besides this undercur- 
rent of resentment. “I’ll show you 
around.” 

Pat leaped up, her cheeks 
flushed. “I want to see every- 
thing. This is all so new.” She 
hurried after him as he grabbed 
his coat and headed for the front 
door. “Can we see the School 
where you train the Psis? I want 
to see how you develop their abil- 
ities. And can we see how the 
Colonial Government is organ- 
ized? I want to see how Fairchild 

27 



works with the Psis.” 

Julie followed the two of them 
out onto the front porch. Cool, 
chill morning air billowed around 
them, mixed with the sounds of 
cars heading from the residential 
syndrome toward the city. “In my 
room you’ll find skirts and 
blouses,” she said to Pat. “Pick 
out something light. It’s warmer 
here than on Prox VI.” 

“Thank you,” Pat said. She 
hurried back into the house. 

“CHE’S pretty,” Julie said to 
^ Curt. “When I get her wash- 
ed and dressed, I guess she’ll look 
all right. She’s got a figure — in a 
healthy sort of way. But is there 
anything to her mind? To her 
personality?” 

“Sure,” Curt answered. 

Julie shrugged. “Well, she’s 
young. A lot younger than 
I am.” She smiled wanly. “Re- 
member when we first met? Ten 
years ago ... I was so curious 
to' see you, talk to you. The only 
other Precog besides myself. I 
had so many dreams and hopes 
about both of us. I was her age, 
perhaps a little younger.” 

“It was hard to see how it 
would work out,” Curt said. 
“Even for us. A half-hour pre- 
view isn’t much, in a thing like 
this.” 

“How long has it been?” Julie 
asked. 

“Not long.” 



“Have there been other girls?” 
“No. Only Pat.” 

“When I realized there was 
somebody else, I hoped she was 
good enough for you. If I could 
be sure this girl had something 
to offer. I suppose it’s her remote- 
ness that gives an impression of 
emptiness. And you have more 
rapport with her than I do. Prob- 
ably you don’t feel the lack, if 
it is a lack. And it may be tied 
in with her talent, her opaque- 
ness.” 

Curt fastened the cuffs of his 
coat. “I think it’s a kind of in- 
nocence. She’s not touched by a 
lot of things we have here in our 
urban, industrial society. When 
you were talking about her it 
didn’t seem to reach her.” 

Julie touched his arm lightly. 
“Then take care of her. She’s go- 
ing to need it around here. I 
wonder what Reynolds’ reaction 
is going to be.” 

“Do you see anything?” 
“Nothing about her. You’re 
going off . I’m by myself for 
the next interval, as far as I can 
preview, working around the 
house. As for now, I’m going into 
town to do some shopping, to 
pick up some new clothes. Maybe 
I can get something for her to 
wear.” 

“We’ll get her things,” Curt 
said. “She should get her clothes 
first-hand.” 

Pat appeared in a cream-col- 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ored blouse and ankle-length yel- 
low skirt, black eyes sparkling, 
hair moist with morning mist. 
“I’m ready! Can we go now?” 
Sunlight glittered down on 
them as they stepped eagerly 
onto the level ground. “We’ll go 
over to the School first and pick 
up my son.” 

T HE three of them walked 
slowly along the gravel path 
that led by the white concrete 
School Building, by the faint 
sheen of wet lawn that was care- 
fully maintained against the hos- 
tile weather of the planet. Tim 
scampered on ahead of Pat and 
Curt, listening and peering in- 
tently past the objects around 
him, body tensed forward, lithe 
and alert. 

“He doesn’t speak much,” Pat 
observed. 

“He’s too busy to pay any at- 
tention to us.” 

Tim halted to gaze behind a 
shrub. Pat followed a little after 
him, curious. “What’s he look- 
ing for? He’s a beautiful child 
. he has Julie’s hair. She has 
nice hair.” 

“Look over there,” Curt said 
to his son. “There’re plenty of 
children to sort over. Go play 
with them.” 

At the entrance to the main 
School Building, parents and 
their children swarmed in rest- 
less, anxious groups. Uniformed 

A WORLD OF TALENT 



School Officials moved among 
them, sorting, checking, dividing 
the children into various sub- 
groups. Now and then a small 
sub-group was admitted through 
the check-system into the School 
Building. Apprehensive, pathetic- 
ally hopeful, the mothers waited 
outside. 

Pat said. “It’s like that on Prox 
VI, when the School Teams come 
to make their census and inspec- 
tion. Everybody wants to get the 
unclassified children put up into 
the Psi-class. My father tried for 
years to get me out of Mute. He 
finally gave up. That report you 
saw was one of his periodic re- 
quests. It was filed away some- 
where, wasn’t it? Gathering dust 
in a drawer.” 

“If this works out,” Curt said, 
“many more children will have 
a chance to get out of the Mute- 
class. You won’t be the only one. 
You’re the first of many, we 
hope.” 

Pat kicked at a pebble. “I 
don’t feel so new, so astonishing- 
ly different. I don’t feel anything 
at all. You say I’m opaque to 
telepathic invasion, but I’ve only 
been scanned one or two times in 
my life.” She touched her head 
with her copper- colored fingers 
and smiled. “If no Corpsman is 
scanning me. I’m just like any- 
body else.” 

“Your ability is a counter-tal- 
ent,” Curt pointed out. “It takes 

29 



the original talent to call it into 
being. Naturally, you’re not con- 
scious of it during your ordinary 
routine of living.” 

“A counter-talent. It seems so 
— so negative. I don’t do any- 
thing, like you do ... I don’t 
move objects or turn stones into 
bread or give birth without im- 
pregnation or bring dead people 
back to life. I just negate some- 
body else’s ability. It seems like 
a hostile, stultifying- sort of abil- 
ity — to just cancel out the tele- 
pathic factor.” 

“That could be as useful as 
the telepathic factor itself. Espe- 
cially for all of us non-teeps.” 

“OUPPOSE somebody comes 
^ along who balances your 
ability, Curt.” She had turned 
dead serious, sounding discourag- 
ed and unhappy. “People will 
arise who balance out all Psi 
talents. We’ll be back where we 
started from. It’ll be like not hav- 
ing Psi at all.” 

“I don’t think so,” Curt an- 
swered. “The Anti-Psi factor is 
a natural restoration of balance. 
One insect learns to fly, so an- 
other learns to build a web to 
trap him. Is that the same as no 
flight? Clams developed hard 
shells to protect them; therefore 
birds learn to fly the clam up 
high in the air and drop him on 
a rock. In a sense you’re a life- 
form preying on the Psis and the 



Psis are life-forms that prey on 
the Norms. That makes you a 
friend of the Norm-class. Bal- 
ance, the full circle, predator and 
prey. It’s an eternal system and 
frankly I can’t see how it could 
be improved.” 

“You might be considered a 
traitor.” 

“Yes,” Curt agreed. “I suppose 
so.” 

“Doesn’t it bother you?” 

“It bothers me that people will 
feel hostile toward me. But you 
can’t live very long without 
arousing hostility. Julie feels hos- 
tility toward you. Reynolds feels 
hostility for me already. You 
can’t please everybody, because 
people want different things. 
Please one and you displease an- 
other. In this life you have to de- 
cide which of them you want to 
please. I’d prefer to please Fair- 
child.” 

“He should be glad.” 

“If he’s aware of what’s going 
on. Fairchild’s an overworked 
bureaucrat. He may decide I ex- 
ceeded my authority in acting on 
your father’s petition. He may 
want it filed back where it was, 
and you returned to Prox VI. 
He may even fine me a penalty.” 

rpHEY left the School and 
drove down the long highway 
to the shore of the ocean. Tim 
shouted with happiness at the 
vast stretch of deserted beach 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



as he raced off, arms waving, his 
yells lost in the ceaseless lapping 
of the ocean waves. The red-tint- 
ed sky warmed above them. The 
three of them were completely 
isolated by the bowl of ocean and 
sky and beach. No other hu- 
mans were visible, only a flock of 
indigenous birds strolling around 
in search of sand crustaceans. 

“It’s wonderful,” Pat said, 
awed. “I guess the oceans on Ter- 
ra are like this, big and bright 
and red.” 

“Blue,” Curt corrected. He lay 
sprawled out on the warm sand, 
smoking his pipe and gazing 
moodily at the probing waves 
that oozed up on the beach a 
few yards away. The waves left 
heaps of steaming sea-plants 
stranded. 

Tim came hurrying back with 
his arms full of the dripping, 
slimy weeds. He dumped the coils 
of still quivering vegetable life 
in front of Pat and his father. 

“He likes the ocean,” Pat said. 

“No hiding places for Others,” 
Curt answered, “He can see for 
miles, so he knows they can’t 
creep up on him.” 

“Others?” She was curious. 
“He’s such a strange boy. So 
worried and busy. He takes his 
alternate world so seriously. Not 
a pleasant world, I guess. Too 
many responsibilities.” 

The sky turned hot. Tim began 
building an intricate structure 



out of wet sand lugged from the 
water’s edge. 

Pat scampered barefooted to 
join Tim. The two of them labor- 
ed, adding infinite walls and side- 
buildings and towers. In the hot 
glare of the water, the girl’s bare 
shoulders and back dripped per- 
spiration. She sat up finally, gasp- 
ing and exhausted, pushed her 
hair from her eyes and struggled 
to her feet. 

“It’s too hot,” she gasped, 
throwing herself down beside 
Curt. “The weather’s so different 
here. I’m sleepy.” 

Tim continued building the 
structure. The two of them 
watched him languidly, crum- 
bling bits of dry sand between 
their fingers. 

“I guess,” Pat said after a 
while, “there isn’t much left to 
your marriage. I’ve made it im- 
possible for you and Julie to live 
together.” 

“It’s not your fault. We were 
never really together. All we had 
in common was our talent and 
that has nothing to do with the 
over-all personality. The total in- 
dividual.” 

Pat slid off her skirt and wad- 
ed down to the ocean’s edge. She 
curled up in the swirling pink 
foam and began washing her hair. 
Half-buried in the piles of foam 
and seakelp, her sleek, tanned 
body glowed wet and healthy in 
the overhead sun.

“Come on!” she called to Curt. 
“It’s so cool.” 

Curt knocked the ashes from 
his pipe into the dry sand. “We 
have to get back. Sooner or later 
I’ve got to have it out with Fair- 
child. We need a decision.” 

Pat strode from the water, body 
streaming, head tossed back, hair 
dripping down her shoulders. 
Tim attracted her attention and 
she halted to study his sand 
building. 

“You’re right,” she said to 
Curt. “We shouldn’t be here 
wading and dozing and building 
sand castles. Fairchild’s trying to 
keep the Separation working, and 
we have real things to build up 
in the backward Colonies.” 

A S she dried herself with Curt’s 
coat she told him about 
Proxima VI. 

“It’s like the Middle Ages back 
on Terra. Most of our people 
think Psi powers are miracles. 
They think the Psis are saints.” 
“I suppose that’s what the 
saints were,” Curt agreed. “They 
raised the dead, turned inorganic 
material into organic and moved 
objects around. The Psi ability 
has probably always been pres- 
ent in the human race. The Psi- 
class individual isn’t new; he’s 
always been with us, helping here 
and there, sometimes doing harm 
when he exploited his talent 
against mankind.” 




Pat tugged on her sandals. 
“There’s an old woman near our 
village, a first-rate Resurrector. 
She won’t leave Prox VI; she 
won’t go with the Government 
Teams or get mixed up with the 
School. She wants to stay where 
she is, being a witch and wise 
woman. People come to her and 
she heals the sick.” 

Pat fastened her blouse and 
started toward the car. “When I 
was seven I broke my arm. She 
put her old withered hands on it 
and the break repaired itself. Ap- 
parently her hands radiate some 
kind of generative field that af- 
fects the growth-rate of the cells. 
And I remember one time when 
a boy was drowned and she 
brought him back to life.” 

“Get an old woman who can 
heal, another who can precog the 
future, and your village is set up. 
We Psis have been helping longer 
than we realize.” 

“Come on, Tim!” Pat called, 
tanned hands to her lips. “Time 
to go back!” 

The boy bent down one last 
time to peer into the depths of 
his structure, the elaborate inner 
sections of his sand building. 

Suddenly he screamed, leaped 
back and came racing frantically 
toward the car. 

Pat caught hold of him and he 
clung to her, face distorted with 
terror. “What is it?” Pat was 
frightened. “Curt, what was it?”

Curt came over and squatted 
down beside the boy. “What was 
in there?” he asked gently. “You 
built it.” 

The boy’s lips moved. “A Left,” 
he muttered almost inaudibly. 
“There was a Left, I know it. 
The first real Left. And it hung 
on.” 

Pat and Curt glanced at each 
other uneasily. “What’s he talk- 
ing about?” Pat asked. 

Curt got behind the wheel of 
the car and pushed open the 
doors for the two of them. “I 
don’t know. But I think we’d bet- 
ter get back to town. I’ll talk 
to Fairchild and get this busi- 
ness of Anti-Psi cleared up. Once 
that’s out of the way, you and 
I can devote ourselves to Tim 
for the rest of our lives.” 

F airchild was pale and 

tired as he sat behind his desk 
in his office, hands folded in front 
of him, a few Norm-class advis- 
ors here and there, listening in- 
tently. Dark circles mooned under 
his eyes. As he listened to Curt he 
sipped at a glass of tomato juice. 

“In other words,” Fairchild 
muttered, “you’re saying we can’t 
really trust you Psis. It’s a 
paradox.” His voice broke with 
despair. “A Psi comes here and 
says all Psis lie. What the hell 
am I supposed to do?” 

“Not all Psis.” Being able to 
preview the scene gave Curt re- 



markable calmness. “I’m saying 
that in a way Terra is right ... 
the existence of super-talented 
humans poses a problem for those 
' without super-talents. But Ter- 
ra’s answer is wrong; sterilization 
is vicious and senseless. But co- 
operation isn’t as easy as you 
imagine. You’re dependent on our 
talents for survival and that 
means we have you where we 
want you. We can dictate to you 
because, without us, Terra would 
come in and clap you all into 
military prison.” 

“And destroy you Psis,” the old 
man standing behind Fairchild 
reminded him. “Don’t forget 
that.” 

Curt eyed the old man. It was 
the same wide-shouldered, gray- 
faced individual of the night be- 
fore. There was something famil- 
iar about him. Curt peered closer 
and gasped, in spite of his pre- 
view. 

“You’re a Psi,” he said. 

The old man bowed slightly. 
“Evidently.” 

“Come on,” Fairchild said. “All 
right, we’ve seen this girl and 
we’ll accept your theory of Anti- 
Psi. What do you want us to 
do?” He wiped his forehead mis- 
erably. “I know Reynolds is a 
menace. But damn it, Terran in- 
filtrators would be running all 
around here without the Corps!” 

“I want you to create a legal 
fourth class,” Curt stated. “The 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Anti-Psi class. I want you to 
give it status-immunity from 
sterilization. I want you to pub- 
licize it. Women come in here 
with their children from all parts 
of the Colonies, trying to con- 
vince you they’ve got Psis to of- 
fer, not Mutes. I want you to set 
up the Anti-Psi class as a similar 
goal, to get them started select- 
ing the Anti-Psi talents out where 
we can utilize them.” 

Fairchild licked his dry lips. 
“You think more exist already?” 

“Very possibly. I came on Pat 
by accident. But get the flow 
started! Get the mothers hover- 
ing anxiously over their cribs for 
Anti-Psis . We’ll need all we 
can get.” 

There was silence. 

“/CONSIDER what Mr. Purcell 
is doing,” the old man said 
at last. “An Anti-Precog may 
arise, a person whose actions in 
the future can’t be previewed. A 
sort of Heisenberg’s indetermi- 
nate particle ... a man who 
throws off all precog prediction. 
And yet Mr. Purcell has come 
here to make his suggestions. 
He’s thinking of Separation, not 
himself.” 

Fairchild’s fingers twitched. 
“Reynolds is going to be mad as 
hell.” 

“He’s already mad,” Curt said. 
“He undoubtedly knows about 
this right now.” 

A WORLD OF TALENT 



“He’ll protest!” 

Curt laughed, some of the offi- 
cials smiled. “Of course he’ll pro- 
test. Don’t you understand? 
You’re being eliminated. You 
think Norms are going to be 
around much longer? Charity is 
damn scarce in this universe. You 
Norms gape at Psis like rustics at 
a carnival. Wonderful . magi- 
cal. You encouraged Psis, built 
the School, gave us our chance 
here in the Colonies. In fifty 
years you’ll be slave laborers for 
us. You’ll be doing our manual 
labor — unless you have sense 
enough to create the fourth class, 
the Anti-Psi class. You’ve got 
to stand up to Reynolds.” 

“I hate to alienate him,” Fair- 
child muttered. “Why the hell 
can’t we all work together?” He 
appealed to the others around 
the room. “Why can’t we all be 
brothers?” 

“Because,” Curt answered, 
“we’re not. Face facts. Brother- 
hood is a fine idea, but it’ll come 
into existence sooner if we 
achieve a balance of social 
forces.” 

“Is it possible,” the old man 
suggested, “that once the concept 
of Anti-Psi reaches Terra the 
sterilization program will be mod- 
ified? This idea may erase the 
irrational terror the non-mutants 
have, their phobia that we’re 
monsters about to invade and 
take over their world. Sit next

to them in theaters. Marry their 
sisters.” 

“All right,” Fairchild agreed. 
“I’ll construct an official direc- 
tive. Give me an hour to word it 
— I want to get all the loopholes 
out.” 

Curt got to his feet. It was 
over. As he had previewed, Fair- 
child had agreed. “We should 
start getting reports almost at 
once,” he said. “As soon as rou- 
tine checking of the files begins.” 

Fairchild nodded. “Yes, almost 
at once.” 

“I assume you’ll keep me in- 
formed.” Apprehension moved 
through Curt. He had succeeded 
... or had he? He scanned the 
next half hour. There was noth- 
ing negative he could preview. He 
caught a quick scene of himself 
and Pat, himself and Julie and 
Tim. But still his uneasiness re- 
mained, an intuition deeper than 
his precog. 

Everything looked fine, but he 
knew better. Something basic and 
chilling had gone wrong. 

IV 

H E met Pat in a small out-of- 
the-way bar at the rim of the 
city. Darkness flickered around 
their table. The air was thick and 
pungent with the presence of peo- 
ple. Bursts of muted laughter 
broke out, muffled by the steady 
blur of conversation. 



“How’d it go?” she asked, eyes 
large and dark, as he seated him- 
self across from her. “Did Fair- 
child agree?” 

Curt ordered a Tom Collins for 
her and bourbon and water for 
himself. Then he outlined what 
had taken place. 

“So everything’s all right.” Pat 
reached across the table to touch 
his hand. “Isn’t it?” 

Curt sipped at his drink. “I 
guess so. The Anti-Psi class is be- 
ing formed. But it was too easy. 
Too simple.” 

“You can see ahead, can’t you? 
Is anything going to happen?” 
Across the dark room the music 
machine was creating vague pat- 
terns of sound, random harmonics 
and rhythms in a procession of 
soft clusters that drifted through 
the room. A few couples moved 
languidly together in response to 
the shifting patterns. 

Curt offered her a cigarette and 
the two of them lit up from the 
candle in the center of the table. 
“Now you have your status.” 
Pat’s dark eyes flickered. “Yes, 
that’s so. The new Anti-Psi class. 
I don’t have to worry now. That’s 
all over.” 

“We’re waiting for others. If no 
others show, you’re a member of 
a unique class. The only Anti-Psi 
in the Universe.” 

For a moment Pat was silent. 
Then she asked. “What do you 
see after that?” She sipped her 



36

drink. “I mean, I’m going to stay 
here, aren’t I? Or will I be go- 
ing back?” 

“You’ll stay here.” 

“With you?” 

“With me. And with Tim.” 
“What about Julie?” 

“The two of us signed mutual 
releases a year ago. They’re on 
file, somewhere. Never processed. 
It was an agreement we made, so 
neither of us could block the 
other later on.” 

“I think Tim likes me. He 
won’t mind, will he?” 

“Not at all,” Curt said. 

“It ought to be nice, don’t 
you think? The three of us. We 
can work with Tim, try to find 
out about his talent, what he is 
and what he’s thinking. I’d enjoy 
that ... he responds to me. And 
we have a long time; there’s no 
hurry.” 

H ER fingers clasped around 
his. In the shifting darkness 
of the bar her features swam 
close to his own. Curt leaned for- 
ward, hesitated a moment as her 
warm breath stained his lips and 
then kissed her. 

Pat smiled up at him. “They’re 
so many things for us to do. Here, 
and perhaps later on Prox VI. I 
want to go back there, sometime. 
Could we? Just for a while; we 
wouldn’t have to stay. So I can 
see that it’s still going on, all the 
things I worked at all my life. 

A WORLD OF TALENT 



So I could see my world.” 

“Sure,” Curt said. “Yes, we’ll 
go back there.” 

Across from them a nervous 
little man had finished his garlic 
bread and wine. He wiped his 
mouth, glanced at his wristwatch 
and got to his feet. As he squeez- 
ed past Curt he reached into his 
pocket, jangled change and jerk- 
ily brought out his hand. Grip- 
ping a slender tube, he turned 
around, bent over Pat, and de- 
pressed the tube. 

A single pellet dribbled from 
the tube, clung for a split second 
to the shiny surface of her hair, 
and then was gone. A dull echo 
of vibration rolled up toward the, 
nearby tables. The nervous little 
man continued on. 

Curt was on his feet, numb 
with shock. He was still gazing 
down, paralyzed, when Reynolds 
appeared beside him and firmly 
pulled him away. 

“She’s dead,” Reynolds was 
saying. “Try to understand. She 
died instantly; there was no pain. 
It goes directly to the central 
nervous system. She wasn’t even 
aware of it.” 

Nobody in the bar had stirred. 
They sat at their tables, faces 
impassive, watching as Reynolds 
signaled for more light. The dark- 
ness faded and the objects of the 
room leaped into clarity. 

“Stop that machine,” Rey- 
nolds ordered sharply. The music 

37 



machine stumbled into silence. 
“These people here are Corps- 
men,” he explained to Curt. “We 
probed your thoughts about this 
place as you entered Fairchild’s 
office.” 

“But I didn’t catch it,” Curt 
muttered. “There was no warn- 
ing. No preview.” 

“The man who killed her is an 
Anti-Psi,” Reynolds said. “We’ve 
known of the category for a num- 
ber of years; remember, it took 
an initial probe to uncover Pat- 
ricia Connley’s shield.” 

“Yes,” Curt agreed. “She *was 
probed years ago. By one of 
you.” 

“We don’t like the Anti-Psi 
idea. We wanted to keep the class 
out of existence, but we were in- 
terested. We’ve uncovered and 
neutralized fourteen Anti-Psis 
over the past decade. On this, 
we have virtually the whole Psi- 
class behind us — except you. The 
problem, of course, is that no 
Anti-Psi talent can be brought 
out unless matched against the 
Psionic talent it negates.” 

Curt understood. “You had to 
match this man against a Pre- 
cog. And there’s only one Prjcog 
other than myself.” 

“Julie was cooperative. We 
brought the problem to her a few 
months ago. We had definite 
proof to give her concerning your 
affair with this girl. I don’t un- 
derstand how you expected to 



keep Telepaths from knowing 
your plans, but apparently you 
did. In any case, the girl is dead. 
And there won’t be any Anti-Psi 
class. We waited as long as pos- 
sible, for we don’t like to destroy 
talented individuals. But Fair- 
child was on the verge of signing 
the enabling legislation, so we 
couldn’t hold off any longer.” 
Curt hit out frantically, know- 
ing even as he did so that it was 
futile. Reynolds slid back; his 
foot tangled with the table and 
he staggered. Curt leaped on him, 
smashed the tall cold glass that 
had held Pat’s drink and lifted 
the jagged edges over Reynolds’ 
face. 

Corpsmen pulled him off. 

C URT broke away. He reached 
down and gathered up Pat’s 
body. She was still warm; her 
face was calm, expressionless, an 
empty burned-out shell that mir- 
rored nothing. He carried her 
from the bar and out onto the 
frigid night-dark street. A mo- 
ment later he lowered her into 
his car and crept behind the 
wheel. 

He drove to the School, parked 
the car, and carried her into the 
main building. Pushing past as- 
tonished officials, he reached the 
childrens’ quarters and forced 
open the door to Sally’s rooms 
with his shoulder. 

She was wide-awake and fully 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



dressed. Seated on a straight- 
backed chair the child faced him 
defiantly. “You see?” she shrilled. 
“See what you did?” 

He was too dazed to answer. 

“It’s all your fault! You made 
Reynolds do it. He had to kill 
her.” She leaped to her feet and 
ran toward him, screaming hys- 
terically. “You’re an enemy! 
You’re against- us! You want to 
make trouble for all of us. I told 
Reynolds what you were doing 
and he—” 

Her voice trailed off as he 
moved out of the room with his 
heavy armload. As he lumbered 
up the corridor the hysterical 
girl followed after him. 

“You want to go across — you 
want me to get Big Noodle to 
take you across!” She ran in 
front of him, darting here and 
there like a maniacal insect. 
Tears ran down her cheeks; her 
face was distorted beyond recog- 
nition. She followed him all the 
way to Big Noodle’s chamber. 
“I’m not going to help you! 
You’re against all of us and I’m 
never going to help you again! 
I’m glad she’s dead! I wish you 
were dead, too. And you’re going 
to be dead when Reynolds catches 
you. He told me so. He said there 
wasn’t going to be any more like 
you and we would have things 
the way they ought to be, and 
nobody, not you nor any of those 
numbskulls can stop us!” 

A WORLD OF TALENT 



He lowered Pat’s body onto 
the floor and moved out of the 
chamber. Sally raced after him. 

“You know what he did to 
Fairchild? He has him fixed so 
he can’t do anything ever again.” 

Curt tripped a locked door and 
entered his son’s room. The door 
closed after him and the girl’s 
frenzied screams died to a muf- 
fled vibration. Tim sat up in bed, 
surprised and half-stupefied by 
sleep. 

“Come on,” Curt said. He 
dragged the boy from his bed, 
dressed him, and hurried him 
outside into the hall. 

Sally stopped them as they re- 
entered Big Noodle’s chamber. 
“He won’t do it,” she screamed. 
“He’s afraid of me and I told 
him not to. You understand?” 

B IG Noodle lay slumped in his 
massive chair. He lifted his 
great head as Curt approached 
him. “What do you want?” he 
muttered. “What’s the matter 
with her?” He indicated Pat’s 
inert body. “She pass out or 
something?” 

“Reynolds killed her!” Sally 
shrilled, dancing around Curt and 
his son. “And he’s going to kill 
Mr. Purcell! He’s going to kill 
everybody that tries to stop us!” 
Big Noodle’s thick features 
darkened. The wattles of bristly 
flesh turned a flushed, mottled 
crimson. “What’s going on, 

39 



Curt?” he muttered. 

“The Corps is taking over,” 
Curt answered. 

“They killed your girl?” 

“Yes.” 

Big Noodle strained to a sit- 
ting position and leaned forward. 
“Reynolds is after you?” 

“Yes.” 

Big Noodle licked his thick lips 
hesitantly. “Where do you want 
to go?” he asked hoarsely. “I can 
move you out of here, to Terra, 
maybe. Or — ” 

Sally made frantic motions 
with her hands. Part of Big 
Noodle’s chair writhed and be- 
came animate. The arms twisted 
around him, cut viciously into his 
puddinglike paunch. He retched 
and closed his eyes. 

“I’ll make you sprry!” Sally 
chanted. “I can do terrible things 
to you!” 

“I don’t want to go to Terra,” 
Curt said. He gathered up Pat’s 
body and motioned Tim over be- 
side him. “I want to go to Prox- 
ima VI.” 

Big Noodle struggled to make 
up his mind. Outside the room 
officials and Corpsmen were in 
cautious motion. A bedlam of 
sound and uncertainty rang up 
and down the corridors. 

Sally’s shrill voice rose over 
the rumble of sound as she tried 
to attract Big Noodle’s attention. 
“You know what I’ll do! You 
know what will happen to you!” 



Big Noodle made his decision. 
He tried an abortive stab at Sally 
before turning to Curt; a ton of 
molten plastic transported from 
some Terran factory cascaded 
down on her in a hissing torrent. 
Sally’s body dissolved, one arm 
raised and twitching, the echo of 
her voice still hanging in the air. 

Big Noodle had acted, but the 
warp directed at him from the 
dying girl was already in exis- 
tence. As Curt felt the air of 
space - transformation all around 
him, he caught a final glimpse of 
Big Noodle’s torment. He had 
never known precisely what it 
was Sally dangled over the big 
idiot’s head. Now he saw it and 
understood Big Noodle’s hesita- 
tion. A high-pitched scream rat- 
tled from Big Noodle’s throat 
and around Curt as the chamber 
ebbed away. Big Noodle altered 
and flowed as Sally’s change en- 
gulfed him. 

Curt realized, then, the amount 
of courage buried in the vege- 
table rolls of fat. Big Noodle had 
known the risk, taken it, and ac- 
cepted — more or less — the conse- 
quences. 

The vast body had become a 
mass of crawling spiders. What 
had been Big Noodle was now 
a mound of hairy, quivering be- 
ings, thousands of them, spiders 
without number, dropping off and 
clinging again, clustering and 
separating and reclustering.

And then the chamber was 
gone. He was across. 

I T was early afternoon. He lay 
for a time, half-buried in 
tangled vines. Insects hummed 
around him, seeking moisture 
from the stalks of foul-smelling 
flowers. The red-tinted sky baked 
in the mounting sunlight. Far 
off, an animal of some kind call- 
ed mournfully. 

Nearby, his son stirred. The 
boy got to his feet, wandered 
about aimlessly and finally ap- 
proached his father. 

Curt pulled himself up. His 
clothes were torn. Blood oozed 
down his cheek, into his mouth. 
He shook his head, shuddered, 
and looked around. 

Pat’s body lay a few feet off. 
A crumpled and broken thing, 
it was without -life of any kind. 
A hollow husk, abandoned and 
deserted. 

He made his way over to her. 
For a time he squatted on his 
haunches, gazing vacantly down 
at her. Then he leaned over, pick- 
ed her up, and struggled to his 
feet. 

“Come on,” he said to Tim, 
“let’s get started.” 

They walked a long time. Big 
Noodle had dropped them be- 
tween villages, in the turgid 
chaos of the Proxima VI forests. 
Once he stopped in an open 
field and rested. Against the line 

A WORLD OF TALENT 



of drooping trees a waver of blue 
smoke drifted. A kiln, perhaps. 

Or somebody clearing away the 
brush. He lifted Pat up in his 
arms again and continued on. 

When he crashed from the un- 
derbrush and out into the road, 
the villagers were paralyzed with 
fright. Some of them raced off, 
a few remained, staring blankly 
at the man and the boy beside 
him. , 

“Who are you?” one of them 
demanded as he fumbled for a 
hack-knife. “What have you got 
there?” 

They got a work-truck for 
him, allowed him to dump Pat 
in with the rough-cut lumber, 
and then drove him and his son 
to the nearest village. He wasn’t 
far off, only a hundred miles. 
From the common store of the 
village he was given heavy work < 
clothes and fed. Tim was bathed 
and cared for, and a general con- 
ference was called. 

He sat at a huge, rough table, 
littered with remains of the mid- 
day meal. He knew their deci- 
sion; he could preview it without 
trouble. 

“She can’t fix up anybody that 
far gone,” the leader of the vil- 
lage explained to him. “The girl’s 
whole upper ganglia and brain 
are gone, and most of the spinal 
column.” 

He listened, but didn’t speak. 
Afterwards, he wangled a bat-

tered truck, loaded Pat and Tim 
in, and started on. / 

H ER village had been notified 
by short-wave radio. Re was 
pulled from the truck by savage 
hands; a pandemonium of noise 
and fury boiled around him, ex- 
cited faces distorted by grief and 
horror. Shouts, outraged shoves, 
questions, a blur of men and wo- 
men milling and pushing until 
finally her brothers cleared a 
path for him to their home. 

They laid her out on a table 
and examined her with shaking 
hands. 

“It’s useless,” her father was 
saying to him. “And the old wo- 
man’s gone, I think. That was 
years ago.” The man gestured 
toward the mountains. “She liv- 
ed up there — used to come down. 
Not for years.” He grabbed Curt 
roughly. “It’s too late, God damn 
it! She’s dead! You can’t bring 
her back!” 

He listened to the words, still 
said nothing. He had no interest 
in predictions of any kind. When 
they had finished talking to him, 
he gathered up Pat’s body, car- 
ried it back to the truck, called 
his son and continued on. 

It grew cold and silent as the 
truck wheezily climbed the road 
into the mountains. Frigid air 
plucked at him ; the road was ob- 
scured by dense clouds of mist 
that billowed up from the chalky 



soil. At one point a lumbering 
animal barred his way until he 
drove it off by throwing rocks 
at it. Finally the truck ran out 
of fuel and stopped. He got out, 
stood for a time, then woke up 
his son and continued on foot. 

It was almost dark when he 
found the hut perched on a lip 
of rock. A fetid stench of offal 
and drying hides stung his nose 
as he staggered past heaps of 
discarded rubble, tin cans and 
boxes, rotting fabric and vermin- 
infested lumber. 

The old woman was watering 
a patch of wretched vegetables. 
As he approached, she lowered 
her sprinkling can and turned 
toward him, wrinkled face tight 
with suspicion and wonder. 

“I can’t do it,” she said flatly 
as she crouched over Pat’s inert 
body. She ran her dry, leathery 
hands over the dead face, pulled 
aside the girl’s shirt and knead- 
ed the cold flesh at the base of 
the neck. She pushed aside the 
tangle of black hair and gripped 
the skull with her strong fingers. 
“No, I can’t do a thing.” Her 
voice was rusty and harsh in the 
night fog that billowed around 
them. “She’s burned out. No tis- 
sue left to repair.” 

Curt made his cracked lips 
move. “Is there another?” he 
grated. “Any more Resurrectors 
here?” 

The old woman struggled to 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



her feet. “Nobody can help you, 
don’t you understand? She’s 
dead!” 

He remained. He asked the 
question again and again. Final- 
ly there was a begrudging an- 
swer. Somewhere on the other 
side of the planet there was sup- 
posed to be a competitor. He gave 
the old woman his cigarettes 
and lighter and fountain pen, 
picked up the cold body and 
started back. Tim trailed after 
him, head drooping, body bent 
with fatigue. 

“Come on,” Curt ordered 
harshly. The old woman watch- 
ed silently as they threaded their 
way down by the light of Prox- 
ima Vi’s two sullen, yellowed 
moons. 

H E got only a quarter mile. In 
some way,' without warn- 
ing, her body was gone. He had 
lost her, dropped her along the 
way. Somewhere among the rub- 
bish-littered rocks and weeds that 
fingered their way over the trail. 
Probably into one of the deep 
gorges that cut into the jagged 
side of the mountain. 

He sat down on the ground 
and rested. There was nothing 
left. Fairchild had dwindled into 
the hands of the Corps. Big 
Noodle was destroyed by Sally. 
Sally was gone, too. The Colonies 
were open to the Terrans; their 
wall against projectiles had dis- 



solved when Big Noodle died. 
And Pat. 

There was a sound behind him. 
Panting with despair and fatigue, 
he turned only slightly. For a 
brief second he thought it was 
Tim catching up with him. He 
strained to see; the shape that 
emerged from the half-light was 
too tall, too sure-footed. A famil- 
iar shape. 

“You’re right,” the old man 
said, the ancient Psi who had 
stood beside Fairchild. He came 
up, vast and awesome in the 
aged yellow moonlight. “There’s 
no use trying to bring her back. 
It could be done, but it’s too dif- 
ficult. And there’re other things 
for you and me to think about.” 

Curt scrambled off. Falling, 
sliding, slashed by the stones un- 
der him, he made his way blindly 
down the trail. Dirt rattled after 
him while choking, he struggled 
onto the level ground. 

When he halted again, it was 
Tim who came after him. For an 
instant he thought it had been 
an illusion, a figment of his 
imagination. The old man was 
gone; he hadn’t been there. 

He didn’t fully understand un- 
til he saw the change take place 
in front of him. And this time it 
went the other way. He realized 
that this one was a Left. And 
it was a familiar figure, but in a 
different way. A figure he re- 
membered from the past. 



A WORLD OF TALENT 



43 



Where the boy of eight had 
stood, a wailing, fretful baby of 
sixteen months struggled and 
groped. Now the substitution had 
gone in the other direction . 
and he couldn’t deny what his 
eyes saw. 

“All right,” he said, when the 
eight-year-old Tim reappeared 
and the baby was gone. But the 
boy remained only a moment. He 
vanished almost at once, and this 
time a new shape stood on the 
trail. A man in his middle thir- 
ties, a man Curt had never seen 
before. 

A familiar man. 

“ You’re my son,” Curt said. 

T HAT’S right.” The man ap- 
praised him in the dim light. 
“You realize that she can’t be 
brought back, don’t you? We 
have to get that out of the way 
before we can proceed.” 

Curt nodded wearily. “I know.” 
“Fine.” Tim advanced toward 
him, hand out. “Then let’s get 
back down. We have a lot to do. 
We middle and extreme Rights 
have been trying to get through 
for some time. It’s been difficult 
to come back without the ap- 
proval of the Center one. And in 
these cases the Center is too 
young to understand.” 

“So that’s what he meant,” 
Curt murmured as the two of 
them made their way along the 
road, toward the village. “The 



Others are himself, along his 
time-track.” 

“Left is previous Others,” Tim 
answered. “Right, of course, is 
the future. You said that Pre- 
cog and Precog made nothing. 
Now you know. They make the 
ultimate Precog — the ability to 
move through time.” 

“You Others were trying to 
get over. He’d see you and be 
frightened.” 

“It was very hard, but we 
knew eventually he’d grow old 
enough to comprehend. He built 
up an elaborate mythology. That 
i«, we did. I did.” Tim laughed. 
“You see, there still isn’t an ade- 
quate terminology. There never is 
for a unique happening.” 

“I could change the future,” 
Curt said, “because I could see 
into it. But I couldn’t change 
the present. You can change the 
present by going back into 
the past. That’s why that extreme 
Right Other, the old man, hung 
around Fairchild.” 

“That was our first successful 
crossing. We were finally able to 
induce the Center to take his two 
steps Right. That switched the 
two, but it took time.” 

“What’s going to happen now?” 
Curt asked. “The war? The 
Separation? All this about Rey- 
nolds?” 

“As you realized before, we 
can alter it by going back. It’s 
dangerous. A simple change in 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the past may completely alter 
the present. The time-traveling 
talent is the most critical — and 
the most Promethean. Every 
other talent, without exception, 
can change only what’s going to 
happen. I could wipe out every- 
thing that stands. I precede 
everyone and everything. Noth- 
ing can be used against me. I am 
always there first. I have always 
been there.” 

C URT was silent as they' pass- 
ed the abandoned, rusting 
truck. Finally he asked, “What 
is Anti-Psi? What did you have 
to do with that?” 

“Not much,” his son said. 
“You can take credit for bring- 
ing it out into the open, since we 
didn’t begin operating until the 
last few hours. We came along in 
time to aid it — you saw us with 
Fairchild. We’re sponsoring Anti- 
Psi. You’d be surprised to see 
some of the alternate time-paths 
on which Anti-Psi fails to get 
pushed forward. Your precog was 
right — they’re not very pleasant.” 
“So I’ve had help lately.” 
“We’re behind you, yes. And 
from now on, our help will in- 
crease. Always, we try to intro- 
duce balances. Stalemates, such 
as Anti-Psi. Right now, Rey- 
nolds is a little out of balance, 
but he can easily be checked. 
Steps are being taken. We’re not 
infinite in power, of course. We’re 



limited by our life-span, about 
seventy years. It’s a strange feel- 
ing to be outside of time. You’re 
outside of change, subject to no 
laws. 

“It’s like suddenly being lifted 
off the chess board and seeing 
everybody as pieces — seeing the 
whole Universe as a game of 
black and white squares — with 
everybody and every object stuck 
on his space-time spot. We’re off 
the board; we can reach down 
from above. Adjust, alter the po- 
sition of the men, change the 
game without the pieces knowing. 
From outside.” 

“And you won’t bring her 
back?” Curt appealed. 

“You can’t expect me to be too 
sympathetic toward the girl,” 
his son said. “After all, Julie is 
my mother. I know now what 
they used to mean by mill of the 
gods. I wish we could grind less 
small ... I wish we could spare 
some of those who get caught in 
the gears. But if you could see 
it as we do, you’d understand. We 
have a universe hanging in the 
balance; it’s an awfully big 
board.” 

“A board so big that one per- 
son doesn’t count?” Curt asked, 
agonized. 

His son looked concerned. Curt 
remembered looking like that 
himself when trying to explain 
something to the boy that was 
beyond a child’s comprehension. 



A WORLD OF TALENT

He hoped Tim would do a bet- 
ter job than he’d been able to do. 

“Not that,” Tim said. “To us, 
she isn’t gone. She’s still there, 
on another part of the board that 
you can’t see. She always was 
there. She always will be. No 
piece ever falls off the board . 
no matter how small.” 

“For you,” said Curt. 

“Yes. We’re outside the board. 
It may be that our talent will be 
shared by everybody. When that 
happens, there will be no misun- 
derstanding of tragedy and 
death.” 

“And meanwhile?” Curt ached 
with the tension of willing Tim to 
agree. “I don’t have „the talent. 



To me, she’s dead. The place she 
occupied on the board is empty. 
Julie can’t fill it. Nobody can.” 
Tim considered. It looked like 
deep thought, but Curt could 
sense that his son was moving 
restlessly along the time-paths, 
seeking a rebuttal. His eyes fo- 
cused again on his father and he 
nodded sadly. 

“I can’t show you where she 
is on the board,” he said. “And 
your life is vacant along every 
path except one.” 

Curt heard someone coming 
through the brush. He turned — 
and then Pat was in his arms. 
“This one,” Tim said.

Delousing planets was humdrum

to exterminate exterminators ! 



They had constructed the peep-

months after forming their part-

During that time, the aaa ace 
PLANET DECONTAMINATION SERV- 
ICE had had no business — in spite 
of being first in the telephone

was an old, established line, com-

** I — I now,” Gregor said, his 
M long bony face pressed 
against the peephole in the office 
door. 

“Let me see,” Arnold said. 

Gregor pushed him back. “He’s 
going to knock — no, he’s chang- 
ed his mind. He’s leaving.” 

Arnold returned to his desk 
and laid out another game of soli- 
taire. Gregor kept watch at the 
peephole.

young men with big ideas and a 
lot of unpaid-for equipment. 

“He’s coming back,” Gregor 
called. “Quick — look busy and 
important!” 

Arnold swept his cards into a 
drawer and just finished button- 
ing his lab gown when the knock 
came. 

Their visitor was a short, bald, 
tired-looking man. He stared at 
them dubiously. 

“You decontaminate planets?” 

“That is correct, sir,” Gregor 
said, pushing away a pile of 
papers and shaking the man’s 
moist hand. “I am Richard Gre- 
gor. This is my partner, Doctor 
Frank Arnold.” 

A RNOLD, impressively garb- 
ed in a white lab gown and 
black horn-rimmed glasses, nod- 
ded absently and resumed his ex- 
amination of a row of ancient, 
crusted test tubes. 

“Kindly be seated, Mister — ” 
“Ferngraum.” 

“Mr. Ferngraum. I think we 
can handle just about anything 
you require,” Gregor said heart- 
ily. '“Flora or fauna control, 
cleansing atmospheres, purifying 
water supply, sterilizing soil, sta- 
bility testing, volcano and earth- 
quake control — anything you 
need to make a planet fit for 
human habitation.” 

Ferngraum still looked dubi- 
ous. “I’m going to level with you. 



I’ve got a problem planet on my 
hands.” 

Gregor nodded confidently. 
“Problems are our business.” 

“I’m a free-lance real-estate 
broker,” Ferngraum said. “You 
know how it works — buy a planet, 
sell a planet, everyone makes a 
living. Usually I stick with the 
scrub worlds and let my buyers 
do their decontaminating. But a 
few months ago I had a chance 
to buy a real quality planet — took 
it right out from under the noses 
of the big operators.” 

Ferngraum mopped his fore- 
head unhappily. 

“It’s a beautiful place,” he con- 
tinued, with no enthusiasm what- 
soever. “Average temperature of 
71 degrees. Mountainous, but fer- 
tile. Waterfalls, rainbows, all that 
sort of thing. And no fauna at 
all.” 

“Sounds perfect,” Gregor said. 
“Micro-organisms?” 

“Nothing dangerous.” 

“Then what’s wrong with the 
place?” 

Ferngraum looked embarrass- 
ed. “Maybe you heard about it. 
The government catalogue num- 
ber is RJC-5. But everyone else 
calls it Ghost V.” 

Gregor raised an eyebrow- 
“Ghost” was an odd nickname 
for a planet, but he had heard 
odder. After all, you had to call 
them something. There were 
thousands of planet-bearing suns

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



within spaceship range, many of 
them inhabitable, or potentially 
inhabitable. And there were 
plenty of people from the civiliz- 
ed worlds who wanted to colonize 
them. Religious sects, political 
minorities, philosophic groups — 
or just plain pioneers, out to 
make a fresh start. 

“I don’t believe I’ve heard of 
it,” Gregor said. 

Ferngraum squirmed uncom- 
fortably in his chair. “I should 
have listened to my wife. But 
no — I was gonna be a big oper- 
ator. Paid ten times my usual 
price for Ghost V and now I’m 
stuck with it.” 

“But what’s wrong with it?” 
Gregor asked. 

“It seems to be haunted,” Fem- 
graum said in despair. 

F ERGRAUM had radar- 
checked his planet, then leas- 
ed it to a combine of farmers 
from Dijon VI. The eight-man 
advance guard landed and, with- 
in a day, began to broadcast 
garbled reports about demons, 
ghouls, vampires, dinosaurs and 
other inimical fauna. 

When a relief ship came for 
them, all were dead. An autopsy 
report stated that the gashes, cuts 
and marks on their bodies could 
indeed have been made by al- 
most anything, even demons, 
ghouls, vampires or dinosaurs, if 
such existed. 



Ferngraum was fined for im- 
proper decontamination. The far- 
mers dropped their lease. But he 
managed to lease it to a group 
of sun-worshipers from Opal II. 

The sun -worshipers were cau- 
tious. They sent their equipment, 
but only three men accompanied 
it, to scout out trouble. The men 
set up camp, unpacked, and de- 
clared the place a paradise. They 
radioed the home group to come 
at once — then, suddenly, there 
was a wild scream and radio 
silence. 

A patrol ship went to Ghost 
V, buried the three mangled bod- 
ies, and departed in five minutes 
fiat. 

“And that did it,” Ferngraum 
said. “Now no one will touch it 
at any price. Space crews refuse 
to land on it. And I still don’t 
know what happened.” 

He sighed deeply and looked at 
Gregor. “It’s your baby, if you 
want it.” 

Gregor and Arnold excused 
themselves and went into the an- 
teroom. Arnold whooped at once, 
“We’ve got a job!” 

“Yeah,” Gregor said, “but what 
a job.” 

“We wanted the tough ones,” 
Arnold pointed out. “If we lick 
this, we’re established — to say 
nothing of the profit we’ll make 
on a percentage basis.” 

“You seem to forget,” Gregor 
said. “I’m the one who has to 



GHOST V 



49 



actually land on the planet. All 
you do is sit here and interpret 
my data.” 

“That’s the way we set it up,” 
Arnold reminded him. “I’m the 
research department — you’re the 
troubleshooter. Remember?” 

Gregor remembered. Ever since 
childhood, he had been sticking 
his neck out, while Arnold stayed 
home and told him why he was 
sticking his neck out. 

“I don’t like it,” he said. 

“You don’t believe in ghosts, 
do you?” 

“No, of course not.”. 

“Well, we can handle anything 
else. Faint heart ne’er won fair 
profit.” 

Gregor shrugged his shoulders. 
They went back to Ferngraum. 

In half an hour, they had work- 
ed out their terms — a large per- 
centage of future development 
profits if they succeeded, a for- 
feiture clause if they failed. 

Gregor walked to the door with 
Ferngraum. “By the way, sir,” 
he asked, “how did you happen 
to come to us?” 

“No one else would handle it,” 
Ferngraum said, looking extreme- 
ly pleased with himself. “Good 
luck.” 

T HREE days later, Gregor was 
aboard a rickety space freigh- 
ter, bound for Ghost V. He spent 
his time studying reports on the 
two colonization attempts and 



reading survey after survey on 
supernatural phenomena. 

They didn’t help at all. No 
trace of animal life had been 
found on Ghost V. And no proof 
of the existence of supernatural 
creatures had been discovered 
anywhere in the Galaxy. 

Gregor pondered this, then 
checked his weapons as the 
freighter spiraled into the region 
of Ghost V. He was carrying an 
arsenal large enough to start a 
small war and win it. 

If he could find something to 
shoot at . 

The captain of the freighter 
brought his ship to within several 
thousand feet of the smiling green 
surface of the planet, but no 
closer. Gregor parachuted his 
equipment to the site of the last 
two camps, shook hands with the 
captain and ’chuted himself 
down. 

He landed safely and looked 
up. The freighter was streaking 
into space as though the furies 
were after it. 

He was alone on Ghost V. 

After checking his equipment 
for breakage, he radioed Arnold 
that he had landed safely. Then, 
with drawn blaster, he inspected 
the sun- worshipers’ camp. 

They had set themselves up at 
the base of a mountain, beside 
a small, crystal-clear lake. The 
pre-fabs were in perfect condi- 
tion.

GHOST V

No storms had ever damaged 
them, because Ghost V was bless- 
ed with a beautifully even cli- 
mate. But they looked pathetical- 
ly lonely. 

Gregor made a careful check 
of one. Clothes were still neatly 
packed in cabinets, pictures were 
hung on the wall and there was 
even a curtain on one window. In 
a corner of the room, a case of 
toys had been opened for the 
arrival of the main party’s chil- 
dren. 

A water-pistol, a top and 
a bag of marbles had spilled onto 
the floor. 

Evening was coming, so Gregor 
dragged his equipment into the 
pre-fab and made his prepara- 
tions. He rigged an alarm system 
and adjusted it so finely that even 
a roach would set it off. He put 
up a radar alarm to scan the im- 
mediate area. He unpacked his 
arsenal, laying the heavy rifles 
within easy reach, but keeping a 
hand-blaster in his belt. Then, 
satisfied, he ate a leisurely sup- 
per. 

Outside, the evening drifted 
into night. The warm and dreamy 
land grew dark. A gentle breeze 
ruffled the surface of the lake and 
rustled silkily in the tall grass. 

It was all very peaceful. 

The settlers must have been 
hysterical types, he decided. They 
had probably panicked and kill- 
ed each other. 



A FTER checking his alarm sys- 
tem one last time, Gregor 
threw his clothes onto a chair, 
turned off the lights and climbed 
into bed. The room was illumi- 
nated by starlight, stronger than 
moonlight on Earth. His blaster 
was under his pillow. All was well 
with the world. 

He had just begun to doze off 
when he became aware that he 
was not alone in the room. 

That was impossible. His alarm 
system hadn’t gone off. The ra- 
dar was still humming peace- 
fully. 

Yet every nerve in his body 
was shrieking alarm. He eased the, | 
blaster out and looked around. 

A man was standing in a cor- 
ner of the room. 

There was no time to consider 
how he had come. Gregor aimed 
the blaster and said, “Okay, raise 
your hands,” in a quiet, resolute 
voice. 

The figure didn’t move. 

Gregor’s finger tightened on the 
trigger, then suddenly relaxed. 
He recognized the man. It was 
his own clothing, heaped on a 
chair, distorted by starlight and 
his own imagination. 

He grinned and lowered the 
blaster. The pile of clothing be- 
gan to stir faintly. Gregor felt 
a faint breeze from the window 
and continued to grin. 

Then the pile of clothing stood 
up, stretched itself and began to 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



walk toward him purposefully. 

Frozen to his bed, he watched 
the disembodied clothing, assem- 
bled roughly into manlike form, 
advance on him. 

When it was halfway across the 
room and its empty sleeves were 
reaching for him, he began to 
blast. 

And kept on blasting, for the 
rags and remnants slithered to- 
ward him as if filled with a life 
of their own: Flaming bits of 
cloth crowded toward his face 
and a belt tried to coil around 
his legs. He had to burn every- 
thing to ashes before the attack 
stopped. 

When it was over, Gregor turn- 
ed on every light he could find. 
He brewed a pot of coffee and 
poured in most of a bottle of 
brandy. Somehow, he resisted an 
urge to kick his useless alarm sys- 
tem to pieces. Instead, he radioed 
his partner. 

“That’s very interesting,” Ar- 
nold said, after Gregor had 
brought him up to date. “Ani- 
mation! Very interesting indeed.” 

“I hoped it would amuse you,” 
Gregor answered bitterly. After 
several shots of brandy, he was 
beginning to feel abandoned and 
abused. 

“Did anything else happen?” 

“Not yet.” 

“Well, take care. I’ve got a 
theory. Have to do some research 
on it. By the way, some crazy 



bookie is laying five to one 
against you.” 

“Really?” 

“Yeah. I took a piece of it.” 
“Did you bet for me or against 
me?” Gregor asked, worried. 

"For you, of course,” Arnold 
said indignantly. “We’re part- 
ners, aren’t we?” 

They signed off and Gregor 
brewed another pot of coffee. He 
was not planning on any more 
sleep that night. It was comfort- 
ing to know that Arnold had bet 
on him. But, then, Arnold was a 
notoriously bad gambler. 

T>Y daylight, Gregor was able 
-■-* to get a few hours of fitful 
sleep. In the early afternoon he 
awoke, found some clothes and 
began to explore the sun-worship- 
ers’ camp. 

Toward evening, he found 
something. On the wall of a pre- 
fab, the word “Tgasklit” had 
been hastily scratched. Tgasklit. 
It meant nothing to him, but he 
relayed it to Arnold at once. 

He then searched his pre-fab 
carefully, set up more lights, 
tested the alarm system and re- 
charged his blaster. 

Everything seemed in order. 
With regret, he watched the sun 
go down, hoping he would live 
to see it rise again. Then he set- 
tled himself in a comfortable 
chair, and tried to do some con- 
structive thinking. 



GHOST V 



53 



There was no animal life here 
— nor were there any walking 
plants, intelligent rocks or giant 
brains dwelling in the planet’s 
core. Ghost V hadn’t even a 
moon for someone to hide on. 

And he couldn’t believe in 
ghosts or demons. He knew that 
supernatural happenings tended 
to break down, under detailed ex- 
amination, into eminently natural 
events. The ones that didn’t break 
down — stopped. Ghosts just 
wouldn’t stand still and let a non- 
believer examine them. The 
phantom of the castle was in- 
variably on vacation when a sci- 
entist showed up with cameras 
and tape recorders. 

That left another possibility. 
Suppose someone wanted this 
planet, but wasn’t prepared to 
pay Ferngraum’s price? Couldn’t 
this someone hide here, frighten 
the settlers, kill them if neces- 
sary in order to drive down the 
price? 

That seemed logical. You could 
even explain the behavior of his 
clothes that way. Static electric- 
ity, correctly used, could — 

S OMETHING was standing in 
front of him. His alarm sys- 
tem, as before, hadn’t gone off. 

Gregor looked up slowly. The 
thing in front of him was about 
ten feet tall and roughly human 
in shape, except for its crocodile 
head. It was colored a bright 



crimson and had purple stripes 
running lengthwise on its body. 

In one claw, it was carrying a 
large brown can. 

“Hello,” it said. 

“Hello,” Gregor gulped. His j 
blaster was on a table, only two 
feet away. He wondered, would 
the thing attack if he reached 
for it? 

“What’s your name?” Gregor 
asked, with the calmness of deep I 
shock. 

“I’m the Purple-striped Grab- j 
ber,” the thing said. “I grab 
things.” 

“How interesting.” Gregor’s j 
hand began to creep toward the 
blaster. 

“I grab things named Richard [ 
Gregor,” the Grabber told him I 
in its bright, ingenuous voice. 
“And I usually eat them in choco- 
late sauce.” It held up the brown 
can and Gregor saw that it was ! 
labeled Smig’s Chocolate — An 
Ideal Sauce to Use with Gregors, | 
Arnolds and Flynns. 

Gregor’s fingers touched the 
butt of the blaster. He asked, 
“Were you planning to eat me?” I 

“Oh, yes,” the Grabber said. 

Gregor had the gun now. He 
flipped off the safety catch and 
fired. The radiant blast cascaded 
off the Grabber’s chest and singed 
the floor, the walls and Gregor’s 
eyebrows. 

“That won’t hurt me,” the I 
Grabber explained. “I’m too tall.” j 



54 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The blaster dropped from Gre- 
gor’s fingers. The Grabber leaned 
forward. 

“I’m not going to eat you now,” 
the Grabber said. 

“No?” Gregor managed to 
enunciate. 

“No. I can only eat you to- 
morrow, on May first. Those are 
the rules. I just came to ask a 
favor.” 

“What is it?” 

The Grabber smiled winningly. 
“Would you be a good sport and 
eat a few apples? They flavor the 
flesh so wonderfully.” 

And, with that, the striped 
monster vanished. 

W ITH shaking hands, Gregor 
worked the radio and told 
Arnold everything that had hap- 
pened. 

“Hmm,” Arnold said. “Purple- 
striped Grabber, eh? I think that 
clinches it. Everything fits.” 
“What fits? What is it?” 
“First, do as I say. I want to 
make sure.” 

Obeying Arnold’s instructions, 
Gregor unpacked his chemical 
equipment and laid out a num- 
ber of test tubes, retorts and 
chemicals. He stirred, mixed, ad- 
ded and subtracted as directed 
and finally put the mixture on 
the stove to heat. 

“Now,” Gregor said, coming 
back to the radio, “tell me what’s 
going on.” 



“Certainly. I looked up the 
word ‘Tgasklit.’ It’s Opalian. It 
means many-toothed ghost. The 
sun-worshipers were from Opal. 
What does that suggest to you?” 
“They were killed by a home- 
town ghost,” Gregor replied nas- 
tily. “It must have stowed away 
on their ship. Maybe there was 
a curse and — ” 

“Calm down,” Arnold said. 
“There aren’t any ghosts in this. 
Is the solution boiling yet?” 
“No.” 

“Tell me when it does. Now 
let’s take your animated clothing. 
Does it remind you of anything?” 
Gregor thought. “Well,” he 
said, “when I was a kid — no, 
that’s ridiculous.” 

“Out with it,” Arnold insisted. 
“When I was a kid, I never 
left clothing on a chair. In the 
dark, it always looked like a man 
or a dragon or something. I guess 
everyone’s had that experience. 
But it doesn’t explain — ” 

“Sure it does! Remember the 
Purple-striped Grabber now?” 
“No. Why should I?” 
“Because you invented him! 
Remember? We must have been 
eight or nine, you and me and 
Jimmy Flynn. We invented the 
most horrible monster you could 
think of — he was our own per- 
sonal monster and he only want- 
ed to eat you or me or Jimmy — 
flavored with chocolate sauce. 
But only on the first of every 



GHOST V

month, when the report cards 
were due. You had to use the 
magic word to get rid of him.” 

T HEN Gregor remembered and 
wondered how he could ever 
have forgotten. How many nights 
had he stayed up in fearful ex- 
pectation of the Grabber? It had 
made bad report cards seem very 
unimportant. 

“Is the solution boiling?” 
Arnold asked. 

“Yes,” said Gregor, glancing 
obediently at the stove. 

“What color is it?” 

“A sort of greenish blue. No, 
it’s more blue than — ” 

“Right. You can pour it out. 

I want to run a few more tests, 
but I think we’ve got it licked.” 
“Got what licked? Would you 
do a little explaining?” 

“It’s obvious. The planet has 
no animal life. There are no 
ghosts, or, at least, none solid 
enough to kill off a party of arm- 
ed men. Hallucination was the 
answer, so I looked for something 
that would produce it. I found 
plenty. Aside from all the drugs 
on Earth, there are about a dozen 
hallucination-forming gases in 
the Catalogue of Alien Trace Ele- 
ments. There are depressants, 
stimulants, stuff that’ll make you 
feel like a genius or an earthworm 
or an eagle. This particular one 
corresponds to Longstead 42 in 
the catalogue. It’s a heavy, trans- 



parent, odorless gas, not harm- 
ful physically. It’s an imagination 
stimulant.” 

“You mean I was just having 
hallucinations? I tell you — ” 

“Not quite that simple,” Ar- 
nold cut in. “Longstead 42 works 
directly on the subconscious. It 
releases your strongest subcon- 
scious fears, the childhood terrors 
you’ve been suppressing. It ani- 
mates them. And that s what 
you’ve been seeing.” 

“Then there’s actually nothing 
here?” Gregor asked. 

“Nothing physical. But the hal- 
lucinations are real enough to 
whoever is having them.” 

Gregor reached over for an- 
other bottle of brandy. This call- 
ed for a celebration. 

“It won’t be hard to decon- 
taminate Ghost V,” Arnold went 
on confidently. ‘‘We can cancel 
the Longstead 42 with no diffi- 
culty. And then — we’ll be rich, 
partner!” 

Gregor suggested a toast, then 
thought of something disturbing. 
“If they’re just hallucinations, 
what happened to the settlers?” 
Arnold was sitent for a mo- 
ment. “Well,” he said finally, 
“Longstead may have a tendency 
to stimulate the mortido — the 
death-instinct. The settlers must 
have gone crazy. Killed each 
other.” 

“And no survivors?” 

“Sure, why not? The last ones 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



alive committed suicide or died 
of wounds. Don’t worry about it. 
I’m chartering a ship immediate- 
ly and coming out to run those 
tests. Relax. I’ll pick you up in 
a day or two.” 

Gregor signed off. He allowed 
himself the rest of the bottle of 
brandy that night. It seemed only 
fair. The mystery of Ghost V 
was solved and they were going 
to be rich. Soon he would be able 
to hire a man to land on strange 
planets for him, while he sat home 
and gave instructions over a 
radio. 

H E awoke late the next day 
with a hangover. Arnold’s 
ship hadn’t arrived yet, so he 
packed his equipment and waited. 
By evening, there was still no 
ship. He sat in the doorway of the 
pre-fab and watched a gaudy 
sunset, then went inside and made 
dinner. 

The problem of the settlers 
still bothered him, but he deter- 
mined not to worry about it. Un- 
doubtedly there was a logical 
answer. 

After dinner, he stretched out 
on a bed. He had barely closed his 
eyes when he heard someone 
cough apologetically. 

“Hello,” said the Purple-strip- 
ed Grabber. 

His own personal hallucination 
had returned to eat him. “Hello, 
old chap,” Gregor said cheerfully, 



without a bit of fear or worry. 

“Did you eat the apples?” 

“Dreadfully sorry. I forgot.” 

“Oh, well.” The Grabber tried 
to conceal his disappointment. “I 
brought the chocolate sauce.” He 
held up the can. 

Gregor smiled. “You can leave 
now,” he said. “I know you’re 
just a figment of my imagination. 
You can’t hurt me.” 

“I’m not going to hurt you,” 
the Grabber said. “I’m just going 
to eat you.” 

He walked up to Gregor. Gre- 
gor held his ground, smiling, al- 
though he wished the Grabber 
didn’t appear so solid and un- 
dreamlike. The Grabber leaned 
over and bit his arm experiment- 
ally. 

He jumped back and looked at 
his arm. There were toothmarks 
on it. Blood was oozing out — 
real blood — his blood. 

The colonists had been bitten, 
gashed, torn and ripped. 

At that moment, Gregor re- 
membered an exhibition of hyp- 
notism he had once seen. The 
hypnotist had told the subject 
he was putting a lighted cigar- 
ette on his arm. Then he had 
touched the spot with a pencil. 

Within seconds, an angry red 
blister had appeared on the sub- 
ject’s arm, because he believed he 
had been burned. If your sub- 
conscious thinks you’re dead, 
you’re dead. If it orders the stig-

mata of toothmarks, they are 
there. 

He didn’t believe in the Grab- 
ber. 

But his subconscious did. 
Gregor tried to run for the 
door. The Grabber cut him off. 
It seized him in its claws and bent 
to reach his neck. 

The magic word! What was it? 
Gregor shouted, “Alphoisto?” 
“Wrong word,” said the Grab- 
ber. “Please don’t squirm.” 
“Regnastikio!” 

“Nope. Stop wriggling and it’ll 
be over before you — ” 
“Voorshpellhappilo!” 

The Grabber let out a scream 
of pain and released him. It 
bounded high into the air and 
vanished. 

G REGOR collapsed into a 
chair, That had been close. 
Too close. It would be a particu- 
larly stupid way to die — rent 
by his own death-desiring sub- 
conscious, slashed by his own im- 
agination, killed by his own con- 
viction. It was fortunate he had 
remembered the word. Now if 
Arnold would only hurry . 

He heard a low chuckle of 
amusement. 

It came from the blackness of 
a half-opened closet door, touch- 
ing off an almost forgotten mem- 
ory. He was nine years old again, 
and the Shadower — his Shadow- 
er — was a strange, thin, grisly 



creature who hid in doorways, ! 
slept under beds and attacked on- 
ly in the dark. 

“Turn out the lights,” the ; 
Shadower said. 

“Not a chance,” Gregor retort- 
ed, drawing his blaster. As long 
as the lights were on, he was safe. | 

“You’d better turn them off.” 

“No!” 

“Very well. Egan, Megan, De- 
gan!” 

Three little creatures scam- 
pered into the room. They raced 
to the nearest light bulb, flung | 
themselves on it and began to j 
gulp hungrily. 

The room was growing darker, j 

Gregor blasted at them each ; 
time they approached a light. 
Glass shattered, but the nimble 
creatures darted out of the way. I 

And then Gregor realized what 
he had done. The creatures 
couldn’t actually eat light. Imag- I 
ination can’t make any impres- | 
sion oh inanimate matter. He had j 
imagined that the room was 
growing dark and — 

He had shot out his light bulbs! j 
His own destructive subconscious I 
had tricked him. 

Now the Shadower stepped out. j 
Leaping from shadow to shadow;* 
he came toward Gregor. 

The blaster had no effect, j 
Gregor tried frantically to think 
of the magic word — and terrified- 1 
ly remembered that no magic j 
word banished the Shadower.

He backed away, the Shadow- 
er advancing, until he was stop- 
ped by a packing case. The Sha- 
dower towered over him and 
Gregor shrank to the floor and 
closed his eyes. 

His hand came in contact with 
something cold. He was leaning 
against the packing case of toys 
for the settlers’ children. And 
he was holding a water pistol. 

Gregor brandished it. The 
Shadower backed away, eying 
the weapon with apprehension. 

Quickly, Gregor ran to the tap 
and filled the pistol. He directed 
a deadly stream of water into 
the creature. 

The Shadower howled in agony 
and vanished. 

Gregor smiled tightly and slip- 
ped the empty gun into his belt. 

A water pistol was the right 
weapon to use against an imag- 
inary monster. 

I T was nearly dawn when the 
ship landed and Arnold step- 
ped out. Without wasting any 
time, he set up his tests. By mid- 
day, it was done and the element 
definitely established as Long- 
stead 42. He and Gregor packed 
up immediately and blasted off. 

Once they were in space, Greg- 
or told his partner everything 
that had happened. 

“Pretty rough,” said Arnold 
softly, but with deep feeling. 
Gregor could smile with mod- 



est heroism, now that he was 
safely off Ghost V. “Could have 
been worse,” he said. 

“How?” 

“Suppose Jimmy Flynn were 
here. There was a kid who could 
really dream up monsters. Re- 
member the Grumbler?” 

“All I remember is the night- 
mares it gave me,” Arnold said. 

They were on their way home. 
Arnold jotted down some notes 
for an article entitled “The Death 
Instinct on Ghost V: An Exam- 
ination of Subconscious Stimula- 
tion, Hysteria, and Mass Hallu- 
cination in Producing Physical 
Stigmata.” Then he went to the 
control room to set the auto- 
pilot. 

Gregor threw himself on a 
couch, determined to get his first 
decent night’s sleep since landing 
on Ghost V. He had barely dozed 
off when Arnold hurried in, his 
face pasty with terror. 

“I think there’s something in 
the control room,” he said. 

Gregor sat up. “There can’t be. 
We’re off the—” 

There was a low growl from 
the control room. 

“Oh, my God!” Arnold gasped. 
He concentrated furiously for a 
few seconds. “I know. I left the 
airlocks open when I landed. 
We’re still breathing Ghost V 
air!” 

And there, framed in the open 
doorway, was an immense gray 



GHOST V 



59 



creature with red spots on its 
hide. It had an amazing number 
of arms, legs, tentacles, claws and 
teeth, plus two tiny wings on its 
back. It walked slowly toward 
them, mumbling and groaning. 

They both recognized it as the 
Grumbler. 

G REGOR dashed forward and 
slammed the door in its face. 
“We should be safe in here,” 
he panted, “that door is air- 
tight. But how will we pilot the 
ship?” 

“We won’t,” Arnold said. 
“We’ll have to trust the robot- 
pilot — unless we can figure out 
some way of getting that thing 
out of there.” 

They noticed that a faint 
smoke was beginning to seep 
through the sealed edges of the 
door. 

“What’s that?” Arnold asked, 
with a sharp edge of panic in his 
voice. 

Gregor frowned. “You remem- 
ber, don’t you? The Grumbler 
can get into any room. There’s 
no way of keeping him out.” 

“I don’t remember anything 
about him,” Arnold said. “Does 
he eat people?” 

“No. As I recall, he just mang- 
les them thoroughly.” 

The smoke was beginning to 
solidify into the immense gray 
shape of the Grumbler. They re- 
treated into the next compart- 



ment and sealed the door. With- 
in seconds, the thin smoke was 
leaking through. 

“This is ridiculous,” Arnold 
said, biting his lip. “To be hunted 
by an imaginary monster — wait! 
You’ve still got your water pis- 
tol, haven’t you?” 

“Yes, but—” 

“Give it to me!” 

Arnold hurried over to a water 
tank and filled the pistol. The 
Grumbler had taken form again 
and was lumbering toward them, 
groaning unhappily. Arnold rak- 
ed it with a stream of water. 

The Grumbler kept on advanc- 
ing. 

“Now it’s all coming back to 
me,” Gregor said. “A water pis- 
tol never could stop the Grumb- 
ler.” 

They backed into the next 
room and slammed the door. 
Behind them was only the bunk- 
room, with nothing behind that 
but the deadly vacuum of space. 

Gregor asked, “Isn’t there 
something you can do about the 
atmosphere?” 

Arnold shook his head. “It’s 
dissipating now. But it takes 
about twenty hours for the affects 
of Longstead to wear off.” 
“Haven’t you any antidote?” 
“No.” 

O NCE again the Grumbler was 
materializing, and neither si- 
lently nor pleasantly. 



60

“How can we kill it?” Arnold 
asked. “There must be a way. 
Magic words? How about a 
wooden sword?” 

Gregor shook his head. “I re- 
member the Grumbler now,” he 
said unhappily. 

“What kills it?” 

“It can’t be destroyed by water 
pistols, . cap guns, firecrackers, 
slingshots, stink bombs, or any 
other childhood weapon. The 
Grumbler is absolutely unkill- 
able.” 

“That Flynn and his damned 
imagination ! Why did we have to 
talk about him? How do you get 
rid of it then?” 

“I told you. You don’t. It just 
has to go away of its own ac- 
cord.” 

The Grumbler was full size 
now. Gregor and Arnold hurried 
into the tiny bunk room and 
slammed their last door. 

“Think, Gregor,” Arnold plead- 
ed. “No kid invents a monster 
without a defense of some sort. 
Think!" 

“The Grumbler cannot be kill- 
ed,” Gregor said. 

The red-spotted monster was 
taking shape again. Gregor 
thought back over all the mid- 
night horrors he had ever known. 
He must have done something 
as a child to neutralize the power 
of the unknown. 

And then — almost too late — he 
remembered. 



T TNDER auto-pilot controls, 
^ the ship flashed Earthward 
with the Grumbler as complete 
master. He marched up and down 
the empty corridors and floated 
through steel partitions into cab- 
ins and cargo compartments, 
moaning, and groaning and curs- 
ing because he could not get at 
any victim. 

The ship reached the Solar 
System and took up an automatic 
orbit around the Moon. 

Gregor peered out cautiously, 
ready to duck back if necessary. 
There was no sinister shuffling, 
no moaning or groaning, no hun- 
gry mist seeping under the door 
or through the walls. 

“All clear,” he called out to 
Arnold. “The Grumbler’s gone.” 

Safe within the ultimate de- 
fense against night-horrors — 
wrapped in blankets that had 
covered their heads — they climb- 
ed out of their bunks. 

“I told you the water pistol 
wouldn’t do any good,” Gregor 
said. 

Arnold gave him a sick grin 
and put the pistol in his pocket. 
“I’m hanging onto it. If I ever 
get married and have a kid, it’s 
going to be his first present.” 

“Not for any of mine,” said 
Gregor. He patted the bunk af- 
fectionately. “You can’t beat 
blankets over the head for pro- 
tection.”

THE OLDEST "PREDICTION" 

T HIS month’s column is again 
based from stem to stern on 
letters from my readers — more 
specifically, on questions which 
cannot very well be treated in 
the usual letter column. 

To begin somewhere, I’ll start 
with a rather sarcastic letter from 
a teacher who seems severely an- 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



noyed by the reading habits of 
some of her pupils. 

“If you science fictionists,” she 
wrote, “call some vague state- 
ments in one of Jules Verne’s 
stories a prediction of the peri- 
scope and some remarks about 
unbreakable glass a prediction of 
transparent plastics, why don’t 
you call Munchausen’s (sic) 
story about the post horn in 
which the melodies froze until 
thawed out a prediction of the 
gramophone?” 

You’re perfectly right, madam 
— why not, indeed? Let’s proceed 
to do exactly as you ironically 
suggest. 

T HE theme has been consider- 
ed sufficiently meritorious to 
be treated at length in an erudite 
paper with the title Antiphanes 
und Miinchhausen by the His- 
toric-Philosophical Department 
of the Academy of Sciences of 
Vienna. The story of the “frozen 
words” did not occur only in the 
fabulous Baron’s fabulous ad- 
ventures, but goes back to the 
“pseudo - Mandeville” and, via 
Rabelais, to classical antiquity, 
the trace ending (for the present) 
at about 400 B.C. The oldest 
known source is Antiphanes Ber- 
gaios, who must not be confused 
with the Antiphanes who was a 
playwright of Athens. 

Circumstances vary in the 
many different versions, but the 



idea is always the same: the pre- 
servation of sounds, particularly 
speech. 

The most appealing version, in 
my opinion, is the one of Baldas- 
sare Castiglione, who died in 
1529. He tells it as the “true ex- 
perience” of an Italian merchant 
of Lucca who, in the course of 
his travels and trading, had come 
to Poland. 

“Since he was in Poland, he de- 
cided to buy a large number of 
sable pelts which he wanted to 
bring back to Italy for a big 
profit. Because the King of Po- 
land and the Duke of Muscovy 
were at war, he could not travel 
to Moscow personally, but suc- 
ceeded, through intermediaries, in 
having a few Muscovite mer- 
chants come to the border with 
their sables. When he came to 
the shores of the Borysthenes 
(Dniepr river), he found it fro- 
zen as hard as a stone. 

“The two parties signaled to 
each other across the frozen river 
and the Muscovites began to 
shout the prices they demanded 
for their sables. But the cold was 
so intense that the merchant of 
Lucca and his interpreters could 
not hear the words, for they froze 
before they had traversed the 
width of the river. The Poles, 
who were used to this occurrence, 
decided to light a large bonfire in 
the middle of the river because, 
they reasoned, the words had re- 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



63 



mained warm for about this dis- 
tance. The river was frozen so 
hard that it could easily stand 
the fire. 

“When the bonfire in the mid- 
dle of the river was lighted, the 
words which had been frozen an 
hour earlier began to thaw and 
they could be understood clearly 
even though their originators had 
departed. The merchant decided, 
however, that the prices asked 
were too high and discarded the 
project, returning home without 
any sables.” 

I grant that it’s impossible to 
consider this a direct and explicit 
prediction of the phonograph. But 
the idea is identical; we have 
learned how to “freeze”, words on 
wax and tape. 

Verne’s description of 'the peri- 
scope is anything but vague; there 
is no important difference be- 
tween his prediction and the real- 
ity. 

He was necessarily less clear 
about plastics, for only one, cel- 
luloid, was in existence in his day. 
Nevertheless, he used that as a 
basis for extrapolation, envision- 
ing a stronger and better sub- 
stance. So did the chemists who 
brought about our present-day 
plastics. 

However, my irritated corre- 
spondent misreads the function 
of science fiction. Its purpose is to 
explore entertainingly, not to pre- 
dict. 



But I will make a personal 
prediction: You, madam, will live 
to see many of its guesses come 
true. You already have, but you 
will see more. 

IMPACT END OF TRAJECTORY 

R ECENTLY I had several let- 
ters from British readers ask- 
ing for clarification of a number 
of points having to do with the 
impact end of a V-2 trajectory. 
My correspondents did not live 
in London when the V-2 were 
falling out of the stratosphere and 
do not live there now, but they 
talked to people who had been 
there during the rocket attack. 
Apparently they got quite con- 
tradictory reports and finally 
drew up a short list of questions 
which might be of general inter- 
est. 

One of my correspondents 
states that an informant insists 
that at least some of the V-2s 
were equipped with a proximity 
fuze. He must be mistaken, for 
we have the word of the former 
commanding officer of the Peene- 
miinde Institute, General Dr. 
Dornberger, that the Germans 
did not have a proximity fuze. 
The concept was familiar to them 
and they had laboratory models, 
but they did not progress to pro- 
duction. The warheads of the 
rockets were armed with impact 
fuzes. 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




Figures along trajectory show velocity V in feet per second and time 
T elapsed since takeoff. "41° Program" refers to angle of firing 
(after vertical takeoff). It was 41 degrees of arc from the vertical. 



Another item of disagreement 
that can be settled is the angle 
at which the rockets fell — “some 
say they came in slantwise and 
others say they arrived vertical- 
ly.” For an answer, look at the 
diagram drawn according to a set 
of available figures. The rocket 
clearly entered the denser layers 
of the atmosphere at a slant. For 
the last six miles, the trajectory 
became slightly steeper, but not 
anywhere near vertical. However, 



to an observer half a mile be- 
yond the impact point, more or 
less directly in the line of fire, 
this might have looked vertical. 

It must be stated here that it 
was apparently not at all difficult 
to see a V-2 rocket approach in 
daylight, provided you knew in 
which direction to look and 
when, and provided also, of 
course, that there was no dense 
overcast. 

The Germans fired about 150 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



65 



rockets from the artillery proving 
ground of Blizna in Poland and 
placed their own test evaluation 
staff in the target area. 

The theory behind this surpris- 
ing practice was that, in firing 
over a range of nearly 200 miles, 
the precise target would not be 
hit, but that the missiles would 
fall close enough to be easily ob- 
served. It worked that way, too. 
The impacts took place between 
1000 feet and three miles from 
the observers. They were inform- 
ed by radio when a rocket was 
under way and knew that impact 
would take place about five min- 
utes and 20 seconds later. Half a 
minute before the impact time, 
they would look up and catch it 
in their glasses. 

O NE discrepancy in the state- 
ments that is still not com- 
pletely settled is night observa- 
tion. If any actual eyewitnesses 
read this, I’d like to hear from 
them. 

During the war, some Lon- 
doners said, and British news- 
papers reported it, that on occa- 
sion a rocket had been seen 
descending “glowing red hot.” 
Experiments have shown that 
some portions of the sheet-steel 
skin do grow hot enough by air 
friction to reach a temperature 
which would be described as red 
hot. But the rocket as a whole 
did not. The Germans who spent 



weeks in the target area during 
their own test firings never saw 
anything like that. 

Dr. Dornberger reports one 
case in which he followed vir- 
tually the whole trajectory of a 
test rocket, from takeoff to almost 
impact, with his field glasses 
after dark. At one point, he won- 
dered what it was he still saw 
and realized that it was the four 
graphite vanes in the exhaust 
blast. The exhaust blast had 
winked out minutes ago, but dur- 
ing the 65 seconds it had been in 
operation, the four graphite vanes 
had been raised to white heat 
and remained visible for the 
whole duration of the flight. 

Maybe this is the explanation, 
but possibly the misunderstand- 
ing arose in another manner. 
During test shots of V-2 rockets 
and also in at least one Viking 
shot, the timing turned out to 
be such that the ground was 
already dark. But the rocket, 
climbing rapidly for 30 miles, 
arrived at a height where it could 
still be reached by the rays of the 
Sun, which had disappeared be- 
low the horizon as far as the 
ground observers were concern- 
ed. The rocket then looked so 
bright so suddenly, it was thought 
at first that a belated explosion 
had occurred. 

Likewise, an observer in Lon- 
don might have caught sight of 
an incoming rocket that was still 



66 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in sunlight, even though the ob- 
server was not. Between the time 
it disappeared from his view 
(having entered the shadow of 
the Earth) and the impact, there 
would then be some 20 to 30 sec- 
onds, a time interval of which the 
observer was either unaware in 
his excitement or which, if he 
was aware of it, he did not men- 
tion specifically in later retelling. 

THE "HIGHEST" MOUNTAIN 

M OST of the letters I receive 
are, quite naturally, of the 
kind that ask something. It is a 
rare event when a letter tells 
me something. But soon after the 
appearance of the May issue, in 
which I touched briefly on the 
story of a supposedly very high 
mountain in eastern Asia, desig- 
nated in the reports by the name 
of Amne Machin, I received a 
letter from a lady in South Caro- 
lina that can be labeled a con- 
tribution to geography. I print 
it just as my correspondent wrote 
it, merely abbreviating a few 
names for very obvious reasons : 
“The story [about the moun- 
tain Amne Machin] was created 
out of thin air, solely to pull the 
leg of an unpopular newspaper- 
man. And the imaginary moun- 
tain was never one mountain but 
two, and they were named for 
the most flat-chested girl known 
to the two pilots who started the 



story, on the theory that since 
real mountains are named for 
Jane Russell, who has real — er — 
attributes, then non-existing 
mountains ought to be named 
for a girl whose attributes were 
non-existent. The girl’s name is 
Ann McN . 

“This newspaperman, whom 
I’ll call Nameless, had attached 
himself to a certain Air Transport 
Command Group at Kurachi, 
India, during that period when 
‘flying the Hump’ was drudging, 
soul-wracking misery. Whenever 
pilots would come in from a 
flight, even before they had had 
time to be thankful that they 
had made another trip and were 
still alive, there would be Name- 
less, his pencil at the ready, 
asking ‘Did anything happen? 
Did anything happen?’ Since a 
routine, uneventful trip was the 
best thing that could happen, the 
pilots became somewhat fed up 
with Nameless. 

“The informant is my brother 
J. B., who was a captain in the 
Air Transport Command. He 
wrote twice weekly and all his 
letters have been kept and I have 
just spent several hours reread- 
ing them to be sure my memory 
was accurate. On one return leg 
of a Hump flight, my brother and 
his co-pilot, Lieutenant B.S., were 
blown off course and arrived sev- 
eral hours late at Kurachi. There 
had been some excitement over 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



67 



their tardiness and, of course, 
Nameless was there to get the de- 
tails practically before they land- 
ed — with, I might add, half a 
teaspoonful of gag in their tanks. 
In reaction to some hours of 
danger, my brother and his co- 
pilot were in high spirits and it 
was then that the story was born. 

“It quickly got out of hand, 
for Nameless believed every 
word, and other pilots added to 
and embellished it with subse- 
quent trips. They grew to love 
that story and they were very 
disappointed when their C.O. 
made them stop. But, of course, 
even though they did stop, you 
can’t smother a good story even 
if it isn’t true . 

Well, if this is the inside story 
of the origin of that mountain — 
and it sounds mighty convincing 
to me — I can only hope that the 
majority of the people who re- 
member the original story will 
also read this letter. 

ROCKET FUELS 

O NE theme that crops up with 
fair regularity in my corre- 
spondence is rocket fuels. There 
seems to be a widespread impres- 
sion around that further rocket 
research and especially the pre- 
liminaries to space travel are 
held up “because we have to wait 
until chemists find a more pow- 
erful fuel.” I don’t think any- 



thing is holding up research work 
at all — not counting some red 
tape which indubitably gets into 
the gears in places — but I can 
say without hesitation what 
could be holding it up. That 
would be plain lack of money. 

Sometimes the suggestions 
made to overcome this imaginary 
obstacle are quite simple. 

One correspondent remarked 
hopefully that rocket engineers 
may one day find out how to 
make dynamite safe enough to 
use it for a fuel. Well, nobody in- 
tends to load up a rocket, espe- 
cially a manned one, with dyna- 
mite, but if it could be done, 
there would be a considerable 
loss of propulsion. The theoreti- 
tical exhaust velocity would be 
10,800 feet per second. From 
comparison of the theoretical 
values obtained by fuels in ac- 
tual use, however, one can con- 
clude that the actual exhaust 
velocity of a dynamite rocket 
would be more like 5000 feet per 
second. Alcohol and liquid oxy- 
gen produce an exhaust velocity 
of 7000 feet per second. 

Others were not deceived by 
the violence of commercial ex- 
plosives, but looked for a real 
criterion, the energy content of 
various substances which could 
be used as fuels. One correspon- 
dent stated that, as far as he 
could tell, the most powerful 
combination should be ozone and 



68 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



beryllium metal — which is cor- 
rect. But then he wondered about 
the problem of how to feed a 
powder (the beryllium metal) in- 
to a rocket motor with some 300 
lbs. per square inch of injection 
pressure and asked my advice on 
how this could be done. If there 
is a suitable method, I don’t 
know it. Moreover, if I did know 
it, I might not trust it. 

Another letter writer suggested 
liquid oxygen as the oxidizer and 
lithium or magnesium metal as 
the fuel, stating that the metals, 
“of course,” would have to be 
fed into the rocket motor in the 
molten state. Well, the melting 
point of magnesium is around 
1200 degrees Fahrenheit while 
that of lithium, though consider- 
ably lower, is still 370 degrees 
Fahrenheit. But the temperature 
of the liquid oxygen in the tank 
next to the hot tank for the 
molten metal is slightly below 
minus 350 degrees Fahrenheit. 

The engineer would, at the 
very least, have a formidable in- 
sulating problems on his hands, 
not to mention his mind. 

S TILL another correspondent 
suggested that the following 
combinations be investigated and 
tried: ozone with molten picric 
acid; fluorine nitrate with molten 
yellow phosphorus; chlorine mo- 
nofluoride with boron hydride; 
and, finally, liquid hydrogen 



peroxide with “liquid” carbon di- 
oxide — he probably meant car- 
bon monoxide and made a typing 
error. 

Another correspondent merely 
wanted to know why rocket engi- 
neers consistently disdain hydro- 
gen as a fuel, even though the 
high energy content of a mixture 
of hydrogen and oxygen must cer- 
tainly be known to them. 

The only way to answer all 
this is to explain the criteria for 
the selection of a fuel. Naturally 
the energy content of a fuel or 
fuel combination is, if not the 
most important, at least the one 
which attracts attention first. It 
can be expressed in two ways, the 
older one being to calculate its 
exhaust velocity. 

I’ll list a few theoretical ex- 
haust velocities of fuels that have 
actually been used at one time or 
another, all of them assumed to 
be burned with pure liquid 
oxygen. 

The value for 100-octane gaso- 
line is 15,100 feet per second, for 
ethyl alcohol 14,400 feet per sec- 
ond, for aniline 14,700 feet per 
second, for vinyl ether 14,600 feet 
per second and for hydrazine hy- 
drate 14,000 feet per second. 

They all look pretty much 
alike, don’t they? They look even 
more alike if you don’t take these 
theoretical figures, but the fig- 
ures you actually obtain, which 
are almost precisely half of the

theoretical exhaust velocities. 

The second and more recent 
method for evaluating this par- 
ticular aspect of a rocket fuel is 
to work out its specific impulse, 
also called specific thrust. This is 
done by measuring the thrust of 
a given rocket motor and divid- 
ing the thrust by the fuel con- 
sumption per second. 

The figures you obtain in this 
manner are all remarkably close 
to 200. Some fuels will come out 
as having a specific thrust of 190 
while others will have a specific 
thrust of 210, but this is about 
as much deviation as you get. The 
only one that stands out is hy- 
drogen, for its theoretical exhaust 
velocity would be around 18,500 
feet per second and its specific 
impulse 280. 

But the exhaust velocity, or the 
specific thrust, is only a com- 
paratively small portion of the 
whole story. There are the so- 
called secondary considerations 
which, because of the close simi- 
larity of the specific thrust of 
most fuels, turn very rapidly into 
primary considerations. Hydro- 
gen happens to be a fine example 
of a high-energy fuel that invali- 
dates this advantage by a number 
of practical disadvantages. 

L ET’S begin with the specific 
gravity of the fuel. Remem- 
bering that the fuel consumption 
is not a question of volume but 



of mass, logically you can pack 
more mass into a given tank if 
the fuel has a high specific grav- 
ity. If your fuel is very “light,” 
you need a larger tank; a larger 
tank will weigh more and the 
rocket will have a greater dead 
weight. 

The specific gravity of liquid 
oxygen is 1.15 or a little higher 
than that of water. But since the 
specific gravity of liquid hydro- 
gen is 0.07, you can immediately 
see how much larger the tanks 
would have to be. Furthermore, 
liquid oxygen is known to be very 
cold, but at the temperature of 
liquid oxygen, hydrogen is still in 
the merry gaseous state. To keep 
it liquid, its temperature has to 
be below minus 252.6 degrees 
centigrade or, translating into 
Fahrenheit, below minus 423 de- 
grees. The hydrogen tank would 
need much better insulation than 
even the oxygen tank, which adds 
to the dead weight. 

Another factor: no metal can 
stand up under the temperature 
of burning rocket fuels, hence the 
motor has to be cooled. This is 
done most efficiently by circulat- 
ing the fuel (or the oxidizer) 
through the cooling jacket of the 
motor before it is injected. A 
liquefied gas is about the worst 
possible substance for this pur- 
pose. Though cold, it cannot ab- 
sorb much heat. Because it is 
likely to be at or near its boiling 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



point, it would turn into a gas, 
choke the flow and blow up the 
motor. 

One of the criteria for a rocket 
fuel combination, therefore, is 
that at least one of the two liquids 
is suitable for cooling the motor. 
In the case of the customary com- 
bination of lightly watered ethyl 
alcohol and liquid oxygen, this 
is, of course, the alcohol. In the 
case of the other customary com- 
bination of nitric acid as the ox- 
idizer and aniline as the fuel, 
either one can be used for this 
purpose. 

More “secondary” considera- 
tions : benzene (benzol) has many 
of the earmarks of a good fuel, 
i but it is not a liquid unless the 
temperature is above 5.4 degrees 
centigrade (42 degrees Fahren- 
heit) which means that on a cold 
day, or in the Arctic, you’d have 
to thaw your rocket out before 
you could fire it. You want a 
liquid that stays a liquid over 
the temperature range the 
weather bureau is likely to pre- 
dict. Nor do you want a liquid 
that has the nasty habit of re- 
quiring pressure to stay liquid. 
Consequently, a pressure tank is 
bound to be a heavy tank. 

You naturally want storability. 
Ideally, a good fuel can be put 



away in drums and be used 
three, six or twelve years later. 
If at all possible, you want your 
fuel to be neither corrosive nor 
toxic, but in practice this demand 
has been relinquished to the ex- 
tent that corrosive and toxic sub- 
stances are accepted if the crew 
can be protected by special cloth- 
ing. The hope is, of course, that 
one day a non-toxic or non-cor- 
rosive substitute will come out of 
the laboratory. 

Finally, there is the problem 
of availability. The fuels must 
not be based on raw materials 
that are rare or especially difficult 
to process. The raw materials, in 
short, should be abundant and 
cheap. Here you can draw an 
even finer line. Alcohol as well 
as gasoline are both in good 
supply. But in the case of an 
emergency, everybody — Army, 
Navy, Air Force, the Marines, the 
Coast Guard and most of indus- 
try — will scream for alcohol and 
gasoline. 

To my mind, a fine rocket fuel 
also has the characteristic that it 
will be completely useless for any 
other type of engine. Hydrazine, 
not much used right now, but 
strongly advocated by many, is 
such a fuel.

mumblings as they were before, 
times when it was hard not to 
overdo them. But it’s important 
not to arouse suspicion. 

It all started the morning I 
went fishing. 

I told Ma I was going fishing 
while we were eating breakfast 
and she didn’t object. She knows 
I like fishing. When I fish, I don’t 
get into trouble. 

“All right, Jim,” she said. 
“Some fish will taste real good.” 
“I know where to get them,” 
I told her. “That hole in the 
creek just past Alf Adams’ place.” 
“Now don’t you get into any 
fracas with Alf,” Ma warned me. 
“Just because you don’t like 
him—” 

“He was mean to me. He 
worked me harder than he should 
have. And he cheated me out of 
my pay. And he laughs at, me.” 
I shouldn’t have said that, be- 
cause it hurts Ma when I say 
someone laughs at me. 

“You mustn’t pay attention to 
what people do,” said Ma, speak- 
ing kind and gentle. “Remember 
what Preacher Martin said last 
Sunday. He said — ” 

“I know what he said, but I 
still don’t like being laughed at. 
People shouldn’t laugh at me.” 
“No,” Ma agreed, looking sad. 
“They shouldn’t.” 

I went on eating my breakfast, 
thinking that Preacher Martin 
was a great one to be talking 



about humility and patience, 
knowing the kind of man he was 
and how he was carrying on with 
Jennie Smith, the organist. He 
was a great one to talk about any- 
thing at all. 

A FTER breakfast, I went out 
to the woodshed to get my 
fishing tackle and Bounce came 
across the street to help me. 
After Ma, Bounce is the best 
friend I have. He can’t talk to 
me, of course — not actually, that 
is — but neither does he laugh at 
me. 

I talked to him while I was 
digging worms and asked him if 
he wanted to go fishing with me. 
I could see he did, so I went 
across the street to tell Mrs. Law- 
son that Bounce was going along. 
He belonged to her, but he spent 
most of his time with me. 

We started out, me carrying 
my cane pole and all my fishing 
stuff and Bounce walking at my 
heels, as if I were someone he 
was proud to be seen walking 
with. 

We went past the bank, where 
Banker Patton was sitting in the 
big front window, working at his 
desk and looking like the most 
important man in all of Maple- 
ton, which he was. I went by slow 
so I could hate him good. 

Ma and me wouldn’t be living 
in the old tumbledown house 
we’re living in if Banker Patton 



DIOT'S CRUSADE 



73 




hadn’t foreclosed on our home 
after Pa died. 

We went out past Alf Adams’ 
place, which is the first farm out 
of town, and I hated him some, 
too, but not as hard as Banker 
Patton. All Alf had done was 
work me harder than he should 
have, then cheat me of my pay. 

Alf was a big, blustery man 
and a good enough farmer, I guess 
— at least he made it pay. He had 
a big new barn and it’s just like 
him not to paint it red, the way 
any proper barn is painted, but 
white with red trim. Who ever 
heard of paint trim on a barn? 

Just beyond Alf’s place, Bounce 
and I turned off the road and 
went down across the pasture, 
heading for the big hole in the 
creek. 

Alf’s pri2e Hereford bull was 
way off in another corner of the 
pasture with the rest of the stock. 
When he saw us, he started com- 
ing for us, not mean or belliger- 
ent, but just investigating and 
ready for a fight if one was of- 
fered him. I wasn’t afraid of him, 
because I’d made friends with 
him that summer I had worked 
for Alf. I used to pet him and 
scratch behind 'his ears. Alf said 
I was a crazy fool and someday 
the bull would kill me. 

“You can never trust a bull,” 
Alf said. 

When the bull was near enough 
to see who it was, he knew we 



meant no harm, so he went back 
across the pasture again. 

We got to the hole and I start- 
ed fishing, while Bounce went up 
the stream to do some investigat- 
ing. I caught a few fish, but they 
weren’t very big and they were- 
n’t biting very often and I got 
disinterested. I like to fish, but 
to keep my interest up, I have 
to catch some. 

So I got to daydreaming. I 
began wondering if you marked 
off a certain area of ground — a 
hundred feet square, say — and 
went over it real careful, how 
many different kinds of plants 
you’d find. I looked over a patch 
of ground next to where I was 
sitting and I could see just or- 
dinary pasture grass and some 
dandelions and some dock and a 
couple of violets, and a buttercup 
which didn’t have any flowers 
as yet. 

Suddenly, when I was looking 
at the dandelion, I realized I 
could see all that dandelion, not 
just the part that showed above 
the ground! 

I DON’T know how long I’d 
been seeing it that way before 
realizing it. And I’m not certain 
that “seeing” is the right word. 
Maybe “know” would be better. 
I knew how that dandelion’s big 
taproot went down into the 
ground and how the little feath- 
ery roots grew out of it, and I 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



knew where all the roots were, 
how they were taking water and 
chemicals out of the ground, how 
reserve food was stored in the 
root and how the dandelion used 
the sunlight to convert its food 
into a form it could use. And the 
funniest thing about it was that 
I had never known any of it 
before. 

I looked at the other plants 
and I could see all of them the 
same way. I wondered if some- 
thing had gone wrong with my 
eyes and if I would have to go 
around looking into things instead 
of at them, so I tried to make 
the new seeing go away and it 
did. 

Then I tried to see the dan- 
delion root again and I saw it, 
just the way I had before. 

I sat there, wondering why I 
had never been able to see that 
way before and why I was able 
to now. And while I was won- 
dering, I looked into the pool and 
tried to see down into the pool and 
I could, just as plain as day. I 
could see clear to the bottom of 
it and into all the corners of it, 
and there were lunkers lying in 
there, bigger than any fish that 
ever had been taken from the 
creek. 

I saw that my bait was no- 
where near any of the fish, so I 
moved it over until it was just 
in front of the nose of one of the 
biggest ones. But the fish didn’t 



seem to see it, or if he did, he 
wasn’t hungry, for he just lay 
there, fanning the water with his 
fins and making his gills work. 

I moved the bait down until 
it bumped his nose, but he still 
didn’t pay any attention to it. 

So I made the fish hungry. 

Don’t ask me how I did it. I 
can’t tell you. I all at once knew 
I could and just how to do it. 
So I made him hungry and he 
went for that bait like Bounce 
grabbing a bone. 

He pulled the cork clear under 
and I heaved on the pole and 
hoisted him out. I took him off 
the hook and put him on the 
stringer, along with the four or 
five little ones I’d caught. 

Then I picked out another big 
fish and lowered my bait down to 
him and made him hungry. 

In the next hour and a half, I 
just about cleaned out all the big 
fish. There were some little ones 
left, but I didn’t bother with 
them. I had the stringer almost 
full and I couldn’t carry it in 
my hand, for then the fish would 
have dragged along the ground. 
I had to sling it over my shoulder 
and those fish felt awfully wet. 

I called Bounce and we went 
back to town. 

E VERYONE I met stopped and 
had a look at my fish and 
wanted to know where I’d got 
them and what I’d caught them 



IDIOT'S CRUSADE

on and if there were any left or 
had I taken them all. When I 
told them I’d taken all there was, 
they laughed fit to kill. 

I was just turning off Main 
Street on my way home when 
Banker Patton stepped out of 
the barber shop. He smelled nice 
from the bottles of stuff that 
Jake, the barber, uses on his 
customers. 

He saw me with my fish and 
stopped in front of me. He looked 
at me and looked at the fish and 
he rubbed his fat hands together. 
Then he said, like he was talking 
to a child, “Why, Jimmy, where 
did you get all those fish?”. He 
sounded a little bit, too, like I 
might not have a right to them 
and probably had used some low- 
down trick to get them. 

“Out in the hole on Alf’s place,” 
I told him. 

All at once, without even try- 
ing to do it, I saw him the 
same way I had seen the dande- 
lion — his stomach and intestines 
and something that must have 
been his liver— and up above 
them all, surrounded by a doughy 
mass of pink, a pulsating thing 
that I knew must be his heart. 

I guess that’s the first time 
anybody ever really hated some- 
one else’s guts. 

I shot out my hands — well, not 
my hands, for one was clutching 
the cane pole and the other was 
busy with the fish — but it felt 



almost exactly as if I’d put them 
out and grabbed his heart and 
squeezed it hard. 

He gasped once, then sighed 
and wilted, like all the starch 
had gone out of him, and I had 
to jump out of the way so he 
wouldn’t bump into me when he 
fell. 

He never moved after he hit 
the ground. 

Jake came running out of his 
barber shop. 

“What happened to him?” he 
asked me. 

“He just fell over,” I said. 

Jake looked at him. “It’s a 
heart attack. I’d know it any- 
where. I’ll run for Doc.” 

He took off up the street for 
Doc Mason while other people 
came hurrying out of the places 
along the street. 

There was Ben from the cheese 
factory and Mike from the pool 
hall and a couple of farmers 
who were in the general store. 

I got out of there and went on 
home and Ma was pleased with 
the fish. 

“They’ll taste real good,” she 
said, looking at them. “How did 
you come to catch that many, 
Jim?” 

“They were biting good,” I 
said. 

“Well, you hurry up and clean 
them. We’ll have to eat some 
right away and I’ll take some 
over to Preacher Martin’s and 



76 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



I’ll rub salt in the others and 
put them in the cellar where it’s 
good and cool. They’ll keep for 
several days.” 

J UST then, Mrs. Lawson ran 
across the street and told Ma 
about Banker Patton. 

“He was talking to Jim when 
it happened,” she told Ma. 

Ma said to me, “Why didn’t 
you tell me, Jim?” 

“I never got around to it,” I 
said. “I was showing you these 
fish.” 

So the two of them went on 
talking about Banker Patton and 
I went out to the woodshed and 
cleaned the fish. Bounce sat 
alongside me and watched me do 
it and I swear he was as happy 
over those fish as I was, just like 
he might have had a hand in 
catching them. 

Now I don’t want you to think 
I’m trying to make you believe 
Bounce actually talked, because 
he didn’t. But it was just as if 
he’d said those very words. 

“It was a nice day, Bounce,” 
I said and Bounce said he’d 
thought so, too. He recalled run- 
ning up and down the stream 
and how he’d chased a frog and 
the good smell there was when 
he stuck his nose down to the 
ground and sniffed. 

People all the time are laughing 
at me and making cracks about 
me and trying to bait me be- 



cause I’m the village idiot, but 
there are times when the village 
idiot has it over all of them. They 
would have been scared they 
were going crazy if a dog talked 
to them, but I didn’t think it 
was strange at all. I just thought 
how much nicer it was now that 
Bounce could talk and how I 
wouldn’t have to guess at what he 
wanted to say. I never thought 
it was queer at all, because I 
always figured Bounce could talk 
if he only tried, being a smart 
dog. 

So Bounce and I sat there and 
talked while I cleaned the fish. 
When I came out of the wood- 
shed, Mrs. Lawson had gone home 
and Ma was in the kitchen, get- 
ting a skillet ready to cook some 
of the fish. 

“Jim, you . .” she hesitated, 
then went on, “Jim, you didn’t 
have anything to do with what 
happened to Banker Patton, did 
you? You didn’t push him or hit 
him or anything?” 

“I never even touched him,” I 
said and that was true. I certain- 
ly hadn’t touched him. 

In the afternoon, I went out 
and worked in the garden. Ma 
does some housework now and 
then and that brings in some 
money, but we couldn’t get along 
if it wasn’t for the garden. I used 
to work some, but since the fight 
I had with Alf over him not 
paying me, she don’t let me work 



DIOT'S CRUSADE 



77 



for anyone. She says if I take 
care of the garden and catch 
some fish, I’m helping out 
enough. 

W ORKING in the garden, I 
found a different use for my 
new way of seeing. There were 
worms in the cabbages and I 
could see every one of them and 
I killed them all by squeezing 
them, the way I’d squeezed 
Banker Patton. I found a cloudy 
sort of stuff on some of the to- 
mato plants and I suppose it was 
some kind of virus, because it was 
so small I could hardly see it at 
first. So I magnified it and could 
see it fine, and I made it go 
away. I didn’t squeeze it like I 
did the worms. I just made it 
go away. 

It was fun working in the 
garden, when you could look 
down into the ground and see 
how the parsnips and radishes 
were coming and could kill the 
cutworms you found there, and 
know just how the soil was and 
if everything was all right. 

We’d had fish for lunch and 
we had fish again for supper, 
and after supper, I went for a 
walk. 

Before I knew it, I was walk- 
ing by Banker Patton’s place 
and, going past, I felt the grief 
inside the house. 

I stood out on the sidewalk 
and let the grief come into me. 



I suppose that outside any house 
in town, I could have felt just as 
easily whatever was going on in- 
side, but I hadn’t known I could 
and I hadn’t tried. It was only 
because the grief in the Patton 
house was so deep and strong 
that I noticed it. 

The banker’s oldest daughter 
was upstairs in her room and I 
could feel her crying. The other 
daughter was sitting with her 
mother in the living room and 
neither of them was crying, but 
they seemed lost and lonely. 
There were other people in the 
house, but they weren’t very sad. 
Some neighbors, probably, who’d 
come in to keep the family com- 
pany. 

I felt sorry for the three of 
them and I wanted to help them. 
Not that I’d done anything 
wrong in killing Banker Patton, 
but I felt sorry for those women, 
because, after all, it wasn’t their 
fault the way Banker Patton was, 
so I stood there, wishing I could 
help them. 

And all at once I felt that 
perhaps I could and I tried first 
with the daughter who was up- 
stairs in her room. I reached out 
to her and I told her happy 
thoughts. It wasn’t easy to start 
with, but pretty soon I got the 
hang of it and it wasn’t hard to 
make her happy. Then I made 
the other two happy and went 
on my way, feeling better about 



78 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



what I’d done to the family. 

I listened in on the houses I 
passed. Most of them were happy, 
or at least contented, though I 
found a couple that were sad. 
Automatically, I reached out my 
mind and gave them happiness. 
It wasn’t that I felt I should do 
something good for any particu- 
lar person. To tell the truth, I 
don’t remember \^hich houses 
I made happy. I just thought if I 
was able to do a thing like that, 
I should do it. It wasn’t right 
for someone to have that kind 
of power and refuse to use it. 

TI/fA was sitting up for me 
when I got home. She was 
looking kind of worried, the way 
she always does when I disap- 
pear for a long time and she 
don’t know where I am. 

I went up to my room and got 
into bed and lay awake for a 
long time, wondering how come 
I could do all the things I could 
and how, suddenly, today I was 
able to do them when I’d never 
been able to before. But finally 
I went to sleep. 

The situation is not ideal, of 
course, but a good deal better 
than I had any reason to expect. 
It is not likely that one should 
find on every’ alien planet a host 
so made to order for our purpose 
as is this one of mine. 

It has accepted me without 



recognizing me, has made no at- 
tempt to deny itself to me or to 
reject me. It is of an order of 
intelligence which has enabled 
it, quickly and efficiently, to 
make use of those most-readily 
manipulated of my abilities and 
this has aided me greatly in my 
observations. It is fairly mobile 
and consorts freely with its kind, 
which are other distinct advan- 
tages. 

I reckon myself fortunate, in- 
deed, to have found so satisfac- 
tory a host so soon upon arrival. 

When I got up and had break- 
fast, I went outside and found 
Bounce waiting for me. He said 
he wanted to go and chase some 
rabbits and I agreed to go along. 
He said since we could talk now, 
we ought to make a good team. 
I could stand up on a stump or 
a pile of rocks or even climb a 
tree, so I could overlook the 
ground and see the rabbit and 
yell out to him which way it was 
going, and he could intercept it. 

We went up the road toward 
Alf’s place, but turned off down 
across the pasture, heading for 
some cutover land on the hill 
across the creek. 

When we were off the road, I 
turned around to give Alf a good 
hating and while I was standing 
there, hating him, a thought came 
into my mind. I didn’t know if I 
could do it, but it seemed to be 



DIOT'S CRUSADE 



79 



a good idea, so I tried. 

I moved my seeing up to Alt’s 
barn and went right through and 
came out in the middle of the 
haymow, with hay packed all 
around me. But all the time, you 
understand, I was standing out 
there in the pasture with Bounce, 
on our way to chase some rab- 
bits. 

I’d like to explain what I did 
next and how I did it, but most- 
ly what worries me is how I 
knew enough to do it — I mean 
enough about chemical reaction 
and stuff like that. I did some- 
thing to the hay and something 
to the oxygen and I started a fire 
up there in the center of the 
haymow. When I saw it was 
started good, I got out of there 
and was in myself again and 
Bounce and I went on across the 
creek and up the hill. 

I kept looking back over my 
shoulder, wondering if the fire 
might not have gone out, but 
all at once there was a little 
trickle of smoke coming out of 
the haymow opening up under 
the gable’s end. 

We’d got up into the cutover 
land by that time and I sat down 
on a stump and enjoyed myself. 
The fire had a good start before 
it busted out and there wasn’t a 
thing that could be done to save 
the barn. It went up with a roar 
and made the prettiest column of 
smoke you’ve ever seen. 



O N the way home, I stopped 
at the general store. Alf was 
there and he seemed much too 
happy to have just lost his barn. 

But it wasn’t long until I un- 
derstood why he was so happy. 

“I had her insured,” he told 
Bert Jones, the storekeeper, 
“plumb up to the hilt. Anyhow, 
it was too big a barn, a lot big- 
ger than I needed. When I built 
it, I figured I was going to go 
into milking heavier than I’ve 
done and would need the space.” 
Bert chuckled. “Handy fire for 
you, Alf.” 

“Best thing that ever happen- 
ed to me. I can build another 
bam and have some cash left 
over.” 

I was pretty sore about bung- 
ling it, but I thought of a way 
to get even. 

After lunch, I went up the road 
again and out into Alf’s pasture 
and hunted up the bull. He was 
glad to see me, although he did 
a little pawing and some bellow- 
ing just to show off. 

I had wondered all the way 
out if I could talk to the bull the 
way I talked to Bounce and I 
was afraid that maybe I could- 
n’t, for Bounce was bound to be 
smarter than a bull. 

I was right, of course. It was 
awful hard to make that bull 
understand anything. 

I made the mistake of scratch- 
ing behind his ears while I tried 



80 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to talk to him and he almost 
went to sleep. I could feel just 
how good the scratching felt to 
him. So I hauled off and kicked 
him in the ribs to wake him up, 
so he would pay attention. He 
did pay a little closer attention 
and even did a little answering, 
but not much. A bull is awful 
dumb. 

But I felt fairly sure I’d got 
my idea across, for he started act- 
ing sore and feisty and I’m afraid 
that I overdid it just a mite. I 
made it to the fence ahead of 
him and went over without even 
touching it. The bull stopped at 
the fence and stood there, paw- 
ing and raising Cain, and I got 
out of there as fast as I coiild go. 

I went home fairly pleased 
with myself for thinking up as 
smart a thing as that. I wasn’t 
surprised in the least to hear 
that evening that Alf had been 
killed by his bull. 

It wasn’t a pretty way to die, 
of course, but Alf had it coming 
to him, the way he beat me put 
of my summer wages. 

I was sitting in the pool hall 
when the news was brought in 
by someone and they all talked 
about it. Some said Alf had 
always claimed you couldn’t trust 
no bull, and someone else said 
he’d often said I was the only 
one who’d ever gotten along with 
this particular bull and he was 
scared all the time I was there 



for fear the bull would kill me. 

They saw me sitting there and 
they asked me about it and I act- 
ed dumb and all of them laughed 
at me, but I didn’t mind their 
laughing. I knew something they 
didn’t know. Imagine how sur- 
prised they’d be if they ever 
learned the truth! 

They won’t, of course. 

I’m too smart for that. 

W HEN I went home, I got a 
tablet and a pencil and 
started to write down the names 
of all my enemies — everyone who 
had ever laughed at me or done 
mean things to me or said mean 
things about me. 

The list was pretty long. It 
included almost everyone in 
town. 

I sat there thinking and I de- 
cided maybe I shouldn’t kill 
everyone in town. Not that I 
couldn’t, for I could have, just 
as slick as anything. But thinking 
about Alf and Banker Patton, I 
could see there wasn’t any last- 
ing satisfaction in killing people 
you hate. And I could see as 
plain as day that if you killed a 
lot of people, it could leave you 
pretty lonesome. 

I read down through the list of 
names I’d made and I gave a 
couple of them the benefit of a 
doubt and scratched them out. I 
read those that were left over 
and I had to admit that every one 



DIOT'S CRUSADE 



81 



of them was bad. I decided that 
if I didn’t kill them, I’d have to 
do something else about them, for 
I couldn’t let them - go on being 
bad. 

I thought about it a long time 
and I remembered some of the 
things I’d heard Preacher Martin 
say, although, as I’ve mentioned 
before, he’s a great one to be 
saying them. I decided I’d have 
to lay aside my hate and return 
good for evil. 

I am puzzled and disturbed, 
although that, perhaps, is the 
normal reaction when one at- 
taches oneself to an alien being. 
This is a treacherous and un- 
principled species and, as such, 
an incalculably important one to 
study. 

I am continually amazed at 
the facility with which my host 
has acquired the use of my tal- 
ents, continually appalled by the 
use he makes of them. 1 am more 
than puzzled by his own convic- 
tion that he is less intelligent 
than his fellows; his actions dur- 
ing my acquaintance with him do 
not bear this out. I wonder if it 
may not be a racial traits a sort 
of cult-attitude of inferiority, that 
it may be ill-mannered to think 
of oneself in any other way. 

But I half suspect that he may 
have sensed me in some way 
without my knowing it and may 
be employing this strange con- 



cept as a device to force me from 
his mind. Under such a circum- 
stance, it would not be prime 
ethics for me to remain with him 
— but he has proved to be such 
an excellent seat of observation 
that I am loath to leave him. 

The fact is, I don't know. 7 
could, of course, seize control o : 
his mind and thus learn the truth 
of this and other matters which 
are perplexing me. But I fear 
that, in doing so, I would de- 
stroy his effectiveness as a free 
agent and thus impair his obser- 
vational value. I have decided 
to wait before taking such drastic 
measure. 

I ATE breakfast in a hurry, 
being anxious to get started. 
Ma asked me what I was going 
to do and I said just walk around 
a bit. 

First off, I went to the parson- 
age and sat down outside the 
hedge between it and the church. 
Pretty soon, Preacher Martin 
came out and began to walk up 
and down in what he called his 
garden, pretending he was sunk 
in holy thought, although I al- 
ways suspected it was just an 
act to impress old ladies who 
might see him. 

I put out my mind real easy 
and finally I got it locked with 
his so neatly, it seem that it was 
me, not him, who was walking 
up and down. It was a queer 



82 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



feeling, I can tell you, for all 
the time I knew good and well 
that I was sitting there back of 
the hedge. 

He wasn’t thinking any holy 
thoughts at all. He was going over 
in his mind all the arguments he 
intended to use to hit up the 
church board for a raise in salary. 
He was doing some minor cussing 
out of some of the members of 
the board for being tight-fisted 
skinflints and that I agreed with, 
because they surely were. 

Taking it easy, just sort of 
stealing in on his thoughts, I 
made him think about Jennie 
Smith, the organist, and the way 
he was carrying on with her, and 
I made him ashamed of himself 
for doing it. 

He tried to push me away, 
though he didn’t know it was 
me; he just thought it was his 
own mind bringing up the matter. 
But I wouldn’t let him push the 
thought away. I piled it on real 
heavy. 

I made him think how the peo- 
ple in the church trusted him and 
looked to him for spiritual lead- 
ership, and I made him remember 
back to when he was a younger 
man, just out of seminary, and 
looked on his lifetime work as a 
great crusade. I made him think 
of how he’d betrayed all the 
things he’d believed in then, and 
I got him down so low, he was 
almost bawling. Then I made 



him tell himself that owning up 
was the only way he could ab- 
solve himself. Once he’d done 
that, he could start life over 
again and be a credit to himself 
and his church. 

I went away, figuring I’d done 
a fair job of work on him, but 
knowing that I’d have to check 
up on him every now and then. 

At the general store, I sat 
around and watched Bert Jones 
sweep out the place. While he was 
talking to me, I sneaked into 
his mind and recalled to him all 
the times he’d paid way less than 
market prices for the eggs the 
farmers brought in, and the habit 
of sneaking in extra items on the 
bills he sent out to his charge 
customers, and how he’d cheated 
on his income tax. I scared him 
plenty on the income tax and I 
kept working at him until he’d 
about decided to make it right 
with everyone he’d cheated. 

I didn’t finish the job airtight, 
but I knew I could come back 
any time I wanted to and in a 
little while, I’d make an honest 
man of Bert. 

X"\VER at the barber shop, I 
watched Jake cut a head of 
hair. I wasn’t too interested in 
the man Jake was working on — 
he lived four or five miles out of 
town — and at the moment, I fig- 
ured that I’d better confine my 
work to the people in the village. 



IDIOT'S CRUSADE 



83 



Before I left, I had Jake plenty 
worried about the gambling he d 
been doing in the back room at 
the pool hall and had him almost 
ready to make a clean breast of it 
to his wife. 

I went over to the pool hall. 
Mike was sitting back of the 
counter with his hat on, reading 
the baseball scores in the morn- 
ing paper. I got a day-old paper 
and pretended to read it. Mike 
laughed and asked me when I’d 
learned to read, so I laid it on 
good and thick. 

When I left, I knew, just as 
soon as I was out the door, he’d 
go down into the basement and 
dump all the moonshine down 
the drain, and before too long, 
I’d get him to close up the back 
room. 

Over at the cheese factory, I 
didn’t have much chance to work 
on Ben. The farmers were bring- 
ing in their milk and he was too 
busy for me to really get into 
his mind. But I did manage to 
make him think of what would 
happen if Jake ever caught him 
with Jake’s wife. And I knew 
when I could catch him alone, I 
could do a top-notch job on him, 
for I saw he scared easy. 

And that’s the way it went. 

It was tough work and at times 
I felt it was just too much of a 
job. But then I’d sit down and 
remind myself that it was my 
duty to keep on — that for some 



reason this power had been given 
me and that it was up to me to 
use it for all it was worth. And 
furthermore, I was not to use 
it for myself, for any selfish ends, 
but for the good of other people. 

I don’t think I missed a per- 
son in the village. 

Remember how we wondered 
if there might not be unseen flaws 
in this plan c f ours? We went 
over it most carefully and could 
find none, yet all of us feared 
that some might show up in 
actual practice. Now I can report 
there is one. It is this: 

Accurate, impersonal observa- 
tion is impossible, for as soon as 
one introduces one’s self into a 
host, his abilities become avail- 
able to the host and at once be- 
come a factor which upsets the 
norm. 

As a result of this, I am getting 
a distorted picture of the culture 
of this planet. Reluctant to inter- 
vene before, I am now convinced 
that I must move to take com- 
mand of the situation. 

B ERT, now that he’s turned 
honest, is the happiest man 
you ever saw. Even losing all the 
customers who got sore at him 
when he explained why he paid 
them back some money doesn’t 
bother him. I don’t know how 
Ben is getting along— he disap- 
peared right after Jake took the 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



shotgun to him. But, then, every- 
one agrees Ben was overdoing it 
when he went to Jake and told 
him he was sorry for what had 
been going on. Jake’s wife is 
gone, too, and some folks say she 
followed Ben. 

To tell the truth, I am well 
satisfied with the way every- 
thing’s turned out. Everyone is 
honest and no one is fooling 
around with anyone else and there 
ain’t a lick of gambling or drink- 
ing going on in town. Mapleton 
probably is the most moral vil- 
lage in the United States. 

I feel that perhaps it turned 
out the way it did because I start- 
ed out by conquering my own 
evil thoughts and, instead of kill- 
ing all the folks I hated, set out 
to do them good. 

I’m a little puzzled when I 
walk through the streets at night 
because I don’t pick up near 
as many happy thoughts as I used 
to. In fact, there are times when 
it keeps me busy almost all night 
long, getting them cheered up. 
You’d think honest folks would 
be happy folks. I imagine it’s be- 
cause, now they’re good instead 
of bad, they’re not so given to 
giddy pleasures, but are more 
concerned with the solid, worth- 
while side of life. 

I’m a little worried about my- 
self. While I did a lot of good, 
I may have done it for a selfish 
reason. I did it, perhaps partly,

When Marsy Gras shot off its skyrockets, 

Mars Observatory gave it the works- 
fireworks! 

By JACK McKENTY 

Illustrated by BECK 



S UNSET on Mars is a pale, 
washed out, watery sort of 
procedure that is hardly 
worth looking at. The shadows of 
the cactus lengthen, the sun goes 
down without the slightest hint of 
color or display and everything is 
dark. About once a year there is 
one cloud that turns pink briefly. 
But even the travel books devote 
more space describing the new

than they do on the sunset. 

The night sky is something else 
again. Each new crop of tourists 
goes to bed at sunrise the day 
after arrival with stiff necks from 
looking up all night. The craters 
of the moons are visible to the 
naked eye, and even a cheap pair 
of opera glasses can pick out the 
buildings of the Deimos Space 
Station. 

A typical comment from a 



87 



sightseer is, “Just think, Fred, we 
were way up there only twelve 
hours ago.” 

At fairly frequent intervals, 
the moons eclipse. The local 
Chamber of Commerce joins with 
the gambling casinos to use these 
occasions as excuses for a cele- 
bration. The “Marsy Gras” in- 
cludes floats, costumes, liquor, 
women, gambling — and finishes 
off with a display of fireworks 
and a stiff note of protest from 
the nearby Mars Observatory. 

rpHE day after a particularly 
-®- noisy, glaring fireworks dis- 
play, the top brass at the 
Observatory called an emergency 
meeting. The topic was not a new 
one, but fresh evidence, in the 
form of several still-wet photo- 
graphic plates, showing out-of- 
focus skyrocket trails and a 
galaxy of first-magnitude aerial 
cracker explosions was presented. 

“I maintain they fire them in 
our direction on purpose,” one 
scientist declared. 

This was considered to be cor- 
rect because the other directions 
around town were oil refineries 
and the homes of the casino own- 
ers. 

“Why don’t we just move the 
Observatory way out in the des- 
ert?” a technician demanded. “It 
wouldn’t be much of a job.” 

“It would be a tremendous 
job,” said Dr. Morton, the physi- 



cist. “If not for the glare of city 
lights on Earth, we wouldn’t have 
had to move our telescopes to the 
Moon. If not for the gravel fall- 
ing out of the sky on the Moon, 
making it necessary to resurface 
the reflectors every week, we 
wouldn’t have had to move to 
Mars. Viewing conditions here are 
just about perfect— except for the 
immense cost of transporting the 
equipment, building materials, 
workmen, and paying us triple 
time for working so far from 
home. Why, did you ever figure 
the cost of a single photographic 
plate? What with salaries, freight 
to and from Earth, maintenance 
and all the rest, it’s enormous!” 

“Then why don’t we cut down 
the cost of ruined exposures,” 
asked the technician, “by mov- 
ing the Observatory away from 
town?” 

“Because,” Dr. Morton ex- 
plained, “we’d have to bring in 
crews to tear the place down, 
other crews to move it, still more 
crews to rebuild it. Not to men- 
tion unavoidable breakage and 
replacement, which involve more 
freight from Earth. At $7.97 per 
pound dead-weight . well, you 
figure it out.” 

“So we can’t move and we can’t 
afford ruined thousand-dollar 
plates,” said the scientist who had 
considered himself a target for 
the fireworks. “Then what’s the 
answer?”

The usual suggestion was pro- 
posed that a delegation approach 
the Town Council to follow up 
the letter of protest. A search 
through the past meetings’ min- 
utes showed that this had never 
accomplished anything up to 
date. 

A recent arrival to the Observa- 
tory mentioned that their com- 
bined brain power should be 
enough to beat the games and 
thus force the casino owners — 
who were the real offenders — out 
of business. One of the scientists, 
who had already tried that very 
scheme on a small scale, reported 
his results. He proved with his 
tabulations that, in this instance, 
science, in the guise of the law of 
averages, was unfortunately 
against them. 

Dr. Morton rose to his feet. 
The other men listened to his 
plan, at first with shocked horror, 
then with deep interest and final- 
ly in wild exultation. The meet- 
ing broke up with most of the 
members grinning from ear to ear. 
“It’s lucky Dr. Morton is a physi- 
cist,” said one of the directors. 
“No astronomer would ever have 
thought of that,” 

A FEW days later a modest 
little ad appeared in the 
weekly publication “What to do 
in Marsport.” It did not try to 
compete with any of the casino 
ads (all of which featured pretty 



girls), but it had a unique head- 
ing.

For the First Time Ever 
Your HOROSCOPE

FAMOUS MARS OBSERVATORY 

Learn your Luck, your Future! 

Write or call Mars Observatory. 

No charge. No obligation. 

Since the horoscopes being of- 
fered were about the only things 
on Mars that didn’t cost the tour- 
ists any n oney, the response was 
great. The recipient of a horo- 
scope found a mimeographed 
folder which contained three 
pages describing the present posi- 
tions of the planets, where to 
look for Earth in the sky, and 
what science hoped to learn the 
next time Mercury was in transit. 
The fourth page held the kicker. 
It said that while the tourist’s 
luck would be better than average 
at most of the gambling houses, 
he would lose consistently if he 
played at Harvey’s Club. 

Within two days the only peo- 
ple playing at Harvey’s were the 
shills. The following day, the visi- 
tors to the observatory included 
Harvey. 

The gambler was welcomed 
with mingled respect for his 
money and contempt for his oc- 
cupation. He was taken immedi- 
ately to see Dr. Morton, who 
greeted him with a sly smile. 



90

Harvey’s conversation was 
brief and to the point. “How 
much?” he asked waving a horo- 
scope under Dr. Morton’s nose. 

“Just a promise,” said the 
scientist. Harvey said nothing 
but looked sullen. “You are on the 
Town Council,” Morton contin- 
ued. “Now, the next time the 
question of tourist entertainment 
is discussed, we want you to vote 
against a fireworks display.” He 
then explained how important 
plates had been ruined by sky- 
rocket trails. 

Harvey listened with great in- 
terest, especially when Dr. Mor- 
ton flatly stated that each casino, 
in turn, would get the same pub- 
licity in the horoscopes. 

“The Council members are all 
for the tourists,” Harvey com- 
mented, “and you guys are sup- 
posed to be nuts, like all scien- 
tists. But I’ll do like you say.” 
He reached into his pocket. 
“Here’s fifty bucks. Use it for a 
full page ad this time and do 
the Desert Sands Casino in 
your next horoscope. And say — 
before I go, can I look through 
the telescope? I never seemed 
to have the time before.” 

A T weekly intervals, Dr. Mor- 
ton “did’’ the Desert Sands; 
Frankland’s Paradise; the Mar- 
tian Gardens; and the Two 
Moons Club. From each owner 
he extracted the same promise — 



to vote against the fireworks at 
the Council meetings. 

The technique was settling 
down to a routine. Each victim 
came, made the promise, paid 
for the following week’s ad, 
named the next casino, and was 
taken on a tour of the Observa- 
tory. Then disaster struck. 

It took the form of an inter- 
planetary telegram from Har- 
vard Observatory, their parent 
organization. It read: 

EARTH NEWSPAPERS CARRYING AC- 
COUNTS OF HOROSCOPES PUBLISH- 
ED BY YOUR ORGANIZATION VERY 
UNSCIENTIFIC MUST STOP AT ONCE

L K BELL DIRECTOR 

Dr. Morton was eating alone 
in the staff dining room when he 
noticed a familiar face beside 
him. “Harvey,” he said. “Guess 
you’ve come down to gloat over 
our misfortune.” 

“No, Professor,” said Harvey. 
“You’ve got my promise to help 
you boys and I’ll stick by you. 
It’s a rotten shame, too. You 
just about made it. The rest of 
the club owners saw the writing 
on the wall and were going to 
cooperate with you when the 
telegram came. All of us got con- 
tacts in the telegraph office, so 
they heard about it soon as it 
arrived and stayed away.” 

Dr. Morton said, “Yes, I sup- 



$1,000 A PLATE

posed they would. There’s not 
much we can do now.” 

“There are thirteen members 
on the Council.” Harvey contin- 
ued, “and you’ve got five of us. 
If that telegram had only come 
one day later — no more fire- 
works. But I got an idea.” 

Dr. Morton pushed aside his 
empty coffee cup and stood up. 
“Let’s get out in the fresh air.” 
The Town Council was adding 
insult to injury by staging one 
of the biggest fireworks displays 
ever. It consisted of practically 
all skyrockets. Dr. Morton ex- 
pressed wonder at their supply; 
Harvey explained that they were 
made right on Mars. He went on 
to tell his idea. 

“I was real interested in every- 
thing when you took me around 
the first time I was here,” the 
gambler said. “The same goes 
for the other boys who saw the 
place. Most of us meant to come 
out here and look around some- 
time, but you people work nights 
and, us mostly working nights, 
too, we never got around to it. 
How about arranging an exclu- 
sive tour sometime just for the 
club operators and their help? 
Then when they see everything, 
you could offer to name a star 
after them or something. If I 
hadn’t already promised, I’d be 
willing to promise, just to be able 
to point in the sky and say 
‘That’s Harvey’s Star.’ ” 



Dr. Morton smiled gently. 
“That’s a wonderful idea,” he 
said, “but I don’t think it would 
work. Any stars worth looking 
at with the naked eye already 
have names. The only ones we 
could name after people are so 
far away that, it would take an 
exposure of several hours, just 
to see them on a photographic 
plate. You wouldn’t be able to 
point yours out at all. Besides, 
Harvard Observatory wouldn’t 
stand for this idea either. It 
would make as much sense to 
them as you naming a poker 
chip after me.” 

He sighed. “But, in any case, 
we would like to have all the 
owners over some time. It might 
improve relations somewhat.” 
The two of them watched a rock- 
et wobble all over the sky be- 
fore exploding. 

“Let’s go back inside,” said the 
physicist. “Maybe we can ar- 
range that tour for Sunday.” 

OUNDAY afternoon the visi- 
^ tors, presumably softened up 
by what one of the chemists 
thought were martinis, were 
seated in the lecture hall listen- 
ing to Dr. Morton’s concluding 
remarks. 

“One of the technicians is 
working on a gadget with a pho- 
tocell that closes the shutter on 
the film when a rocket goes up,” 
Dr. Morton was saying. “It

should cut down the exposure 
time a great deal. Right now, 
every night may be significant. 
If the plates from any one night 
are spoiled, we may not be able 
to duplicate them for a Martian 
year. Mankind is preparing the 
first trip to another star, and the 
work of Mars Observatory is nec- 
essary to insure the success of 
that trip. You gentlemen are 
rightly the leaders of Mars, and 
so it is up to you to decide 
whether or not that success will 
be possible.” He sat down to a 
smattering of applause. 

The visitors, except Harvey, 
then left. 

“It didn’t go over, Professor,” 
said Harvey. 

I know,” said Dr. Morton. 
“That washes out that plan.” 
He turned to the gambler. 
“You’re the only person I can 
trust with this,” he said. “How 
would you like to help me make 
some fireworks?” 

i'ANE week later the two men 
had everything ready. That 
night, as quietly as possible, 
they moved to a position behind 
a fence near the skyrocket 
launching racks. Dr. Morton 
was carrying a compass, a flash- 
light, and a small clinometer; 
Harvey was struggling with two 
large skyrockets. He whispered, 
“What if we miss or they go 
off too soon, or something?” 



“Nonsense, Harvey,” said Dr. 
Morton. He busied himself with 
the flashlight and compass, and 
carefully aimed one of the rock- 
ets. “You forget I am a physi- 
cist.” He then aimed the other 
rocket and checked elevation 
with the clinometer. “The fuels 
are standard, and I worked out 
the trajectories on the computor. 
Ready with your match? These 
are going to explode in the ca- 
nal, and get everybody in the 
Canal Casino all wet.” He peeked 
over the fence, to see how the 
regular display was doing. “Here 
comes their finale. Ready, set, 
light!” 

Covered by the launching of 
the last of the official display, 
their two rockets arced up and 
away. One of them did explode 
in the canal, and most of the 
Casino’s patrons did get wet. 
But the other wobbled off to the 
right, landed on the roof of Har- 
vey’s bachelor home and burned 
it to the ground. 

D R. Morton sat numbly in 
front of his typewriter, star- 
ing at a letter. He couldn’t seem 
to find the right words for what 
he wished to say. He tried to de- 
rive inspiration from a glossy 
photograph lying on the table 
beside him. It had what looked 
like another skyrocket trail on 
it. 

Before he could answer it, the

door opened and Harvey walked 
in, accompanied by two men 
with muscles. “I haven’t seen 
you since the accident, Profes- 
sor,” he said. 

“I’ve been trying to write you 
a letter,” said Dr. Morton, “to 
tell you how sorry I am about 
what happened. And I also have 
to thank you for getting that law 
against fireworks through the 
Council. I am extremely sorry it 
took your house burning down 
to convince them.” 

“I keep my promises,” said 
Harvey. One of the men with 
muscles turned the radio on, 
loud. 

“We’re trying to get up a col- 
lection among the staff to help 
pay for your losses,” said Dr. 
Morton, “but the director sug- 
gested a more permanent kind 
of remembrance.” He picked up 
the photograph. “This will be 
one of the brightest objects in 
the sky, in a few months. It won’t 
be back again for thousands of 
years, but it will be around for 
a good while. We’ve just dis- 
covered it, and it is our privi- 
lege to call it ‘Harvey’s Comet.’ ” 

“That’s nice,” said Harvey. 
The first of the two men went 
around pulling down blinds; the 
other went into the bathroom 
and starting filling the tub. 

“Well,” said the physicist, 
looking tired and old, “I guess 
there’s nothing more I can say.” 



“Oh, yes, there is, Professor,” 
said Harvey, with a sudden grin 
on his face. He turned to his 
muscle men. “You two guys cut 
out the comedy and bring it in, 
now.” 

The two men followed his in- 
structions. 

“You see, Professor,” the 
gambler continued, “I took a 
beating on the house, but the 
other club boys chipped in and 
made up all my losses. So, I 
don’t need your money at all. 
Besides, I have two things to 
thank you for. First, I heard 
about the comet from one of 
your men, and it’s the nicest 
thing anybody’s ever done for 
me.” One of his men came back 
with what looked like a round 
candy box. “Second, that fire 
was the best publicity stunt I 
could get. It made the papers 
back on Earth and all the new 
tourists are packing into the 
Harvey Club. Even the other 
operators are playing my tables. 
That’s why I want you to have 
this.” 

He handed Dr. Morton the 
box. It read “Harvey’s Club” 
in the center, and “Doctor Mor- 
ton’s Poker Chip” around the 
edge. Across the bottom, it said 
“Five Thousand.” 

“That’s dollars in it, Profes- 
sor,” said Harvey. “Don’t spend 
it all in one place.”

PORTALS OF TOMORROW, 
edited by August Derleth. Rine- 
hart & Co., $3.75 

T HE indefatigable Derleth has 
rung the bell with his fifteenth 
anthology. This is not only be- 
cause the story selection is so 
catholic and type-inclusive, but 
also because, like a true annual, 
the book has a complete author 
index of all science fiction and 
fantasy published in over 45 dif- 
ferent magazines in 1953, as well 
as a list of the year’s outstanding 
collections of science fiction, fan- 
tasy and supernatural stories. 



One could only wish that Der- 
leth would publish an author in- 
dex for 1951 and 1952, so that 
there would be a complete series 
of annual supplements to Don 
Day’s invaluable Index. 

As for the stories, there are 
very few among the 16 in this 
book that aren’t first class. Among 
my favorites are Simak’s “Kin- 
dergarten,” Bretnor 8s Neville’s 
“Gratitude Guaranteed,” Fredric 
Brown’s “Rustle of Wings,” and 
Mildred Clingerman’s “The 
Word” and “Stickeney and the 
Critic.”

thony, Bradbury, Blish, Clifton

by my standards. 

A really good collection. 

THE LIVING BRAIN by W. 
Grey Walter. W. W. Norton & 
Co., Inc., $3.95 

J IM Blish called my attention 
to this exciting and vividly 
written book, which was pub- 
lished last year. It will be of spe- 
cial interest to Galaxy readers 
who want to know how near — or 
how far — we are today from actu- 
ally realizing some of our extra- 
polations on the brain. 

The author is a British physi- 
ologist and a pioneer in the 
development of electro-enceph- 
alography since the war. His book 
starts with a brilliant review of 
the whole history of the develop- 
ment of the brain from the very 
origins of life, eons ago. Then 
follow a survey of modem elec- 
tro-encephalography (EEG), a 
report on modem homeostatic 
machines that in little ways imi- 
tate some of the actions of senti- 
ent beings, a short study of the 
learning process, and an evalua- 
tion of the future of modem brain 
research. 

It is an example of scientific 
popularization at its best. 



NINE TALES OF SPACE AND 
TIME, edited by Raymond J. 
Healy. Henry Holt & Co., $3.50 

TTEALY’S second collection of 
never -before -published sci- 
ence fiction stories is almost, but 
not quite, up to the original, 
which came out in 1951. 

John W. Campbell, Jr., offers 
his first fiction in 15 years — and 
a good story it is, too. David H. 
Fink, M.D., author of Release 
from Nervous Tension, contrib- 
utes a remarkable item, the first 
science fiction he has ever written. 
One H. L. Gold has written an 
excellent little tale that is guar- 
anteed to haunt your dreams. 
Frank Fenton has a sharply sa- 
tiric bit on the disadvantages of 
being an egghead in Hollywood. 

Other tales are contributed by 
editors Boucher, McComas and 
Healy, and writers Bretnor and 
Neville, the latter with a moving 
sequel to his “Bettyann,” the chef 
d’oeuvre of Healy’s first anthol- 
ogy. 

EDITOR’S CHOICE IN SCI- 
ENCE FICTION, compiled by 
Samuel Moskowitz. The Mc- 
Bride Co., $3.50 

U NEVENNESS is the hall- 
mark of this anthology. It 
has some very good stories, sev- 
eral poor ones, and the worst 
jacket I have ever seen on any 



96 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



book. The 12 stories were alleg- 
edly selected by the editors of 12 
science fiction and weird maga- 
zines. 

The Clifton-Apostolides “What 
Thin Partitions,” from Astound- 
ing, is delightful; Arthur Clarke’s 
gentle fantasy of a Moebius strip 
world, “Wall of Darkness,” is 
Class A, as is Mona Farnsworth’s 
“All Roads,” from Unknown. 
Eando Binder’s “I, Robot” is im- 
portant historically; and Harry 
Bates’ “Death of a Sensitive” is 
almost first rate — with a little cut- 
ting, it would be. 

The rest of the tales, by Jack 
Kirkland, Frank B. Long, Wil- 
son Tucker, Chester D. Cuthbert, 
Robert B. Johnson, Robert W. 
Chambers and Otis A. Kline, 
range from passable to awful. 

ENGINEER’S DREAMS by 
Willy Ley. Viking Press, $3.50 

TTERE is Ley at his best: an 
original idea, authoritatively 
and charmingly carried out. 
Classed as a “ ’teen-age juvenile” 
by its publishers, the book actu- 
ally is a collection of stimulating 
reports on “engineering projects 
that could come true,” that can 
be enjoyed by people of all ages. 

Included are the fascinating 
narratives of the uncompleted 
tunnel under the English Chan- 
nel; of various plans for sea- 
dromes for stopover points for 



transatlantic planes; of attempts 
to harness volcanic energy in Ice- 
land (fantastic!) and at Larde- 
rello, Italy; and of the Jordan 
Valley project, the Congo-Lake- 
Chad-Sea vision, the plan for 
damming the Mediterranean, and 
various other exciting and pos- 
sible engineering ideas. 

The book won the New York 
Her aid -Tribune's annual award 
for the best in the group of books 
for older boys and girls, but don’t 
let that dissuade you. It’s also 
dandy for gray-beards of both 
sexes. 

PLANETS FOR SALE by E. 
Mayne Hull. Frederick Fell, Inc., 
$2.75 

TF you like old-fashioned space 
opera, this book may be your 
meat. It has all the subtlety of a 
broadaxe and none of the ma- 
turity of concept or characteriza- 
tion that we expect of good 
science fiction today — but it is 
fast-moving, and that’s enough 
for lots of people. 

Five of the six novelets from 
which it has been made consti- 
tute the old “Artur Blord” series 
in Astounding, 1943-6, though no 
acknowledgment of this appears 
in the book. The tales tell the 
exploits of superman Artur Blord 
on the Big Business planets of 
the Ridge Stars, where everything 
goes.

The best clue to the science 
fiction quality of the book comes 
from a note Mrs. van Vogt (who 
uses her maiden name for her 
stories) has on the jacket: “The 
great problem was my almost 
total lack of scientific knowledge. 
To overcome this handicap, my 
husband and I figured out a story 
pattern which would bypass the 
need to show a science explana- 
tion.” 

And this is the fact. To Mrs. 
van Vogt, the impossible is 
achievable simply by writing it 
down. If you like that sort of anti- 
logical science fiction, this is for 
you. 

YEAR’S BEST SCIENCE FIC- 
TION NOVELS : 1954, edited by 
Everett F. Bleiler and T. E. Dik- 
ty. Frederick Fell, Inc., $3.50 

T HE third Bleiler-Dikty nove- 
let annual contains five stories, 
including two that are first rate. 

One is Frank M. Robinson’s 
“The Oceans Are Wide.” It’s in 
the grand tradition of Heinlein’s 
“Universe” — the story of a cen- 
tury-long trip to a whole popula- 
tion of Terrans to the planet of 
a distant star. The only trouble 
is that it should have been a 
novel. But even what we get is 
wonderful. 

The other class A item is a 
good, creepy and very real dimen- 
sional tale by one H. L. Gold 



(hm-m, two in one month, both 
fine jobs) in collaboration with 
Robert W. Krepps, called “The 
Enormous Room.” 

A pleasant fantasy by Murray 
Leinster, entitled “The Senti- 
mentalists,” which ran in these 
pages, is also good. Philip K. 
Dick’s “Second Variety” I found 
rather derivative and portentous. 
Kendell Crossen’s “Assignment to 
Aldebaran” appealed to me as 
humor from the pre-adult, or Nat 
Schachner, stage of science fic- 
tion.^ 

These are not the “best novel- 
ets” of the year, as a whole, but 
plenty good enough, most of 
them. 

THE GIANT ANTHOLOGY 
OF SCIENCE FICTION, edit- 
ed by Leo Mar Julies and Oscar J. 
Friend. Merlin Press, $3.95 

A ND still the anthologies come ! 

This is the fifth for this one 
month ! 

Ten longish novelets in 580 
pages make this book a good 
buy, bulk-wise. Science fiction- 
wise, though, it is pretty much 
old-fashioned implausible stuff. 

There are a handful of good 
items, including Robert Hein- 
lein’s “By His Bootstraps” (pre- 
viously anthologized under the 
name Anson .MacDonald in the 
first edition of the Healy-Mc- 
Comas Adventures in Time and 



98 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Space ) ; a rip-snorting meller- 
drammer of the future by Henry 
Kuttner, “Sword of Tomorrow,” 
which is made better than usual 
by its solid core of social phil- 
osophy; and another anti-Utopia 
by Manly Wade Wellman, “Is- 
land in the Sky,” which is fast- 
moving and pointed, and is based 
on a prophetic imagining of to- 
day’s “space station.” 

You may also like Edmond 
Hamilton’s “Forgotten World,” 
Fredric Brown’s “Gateway to 
Darkness” (all about “neutron- 
ium”), and Murray Leinster’s 
super-fantastic “Things Pass 
By.” 

The other tales, by A. E. van 
Vogt, and Jack Williamson, left 
me anything from chilly to freez- 
ing. 

G. O. G. 666 by John Taine. 
Fantasy Press , Inc., $3.00 

A HERETOFORE unpublished 
novel by the author of Be- 
fore The Dawn, The Crystal 
Horde, Seeds of Life, etc., should 
be good news, but unfortunately 
the present story is pretty hard 
going. It fails because its propa- 
ganda smothers its story values. 
We all know Communists are a 
bad lot, but the black villains of 
Taine’s imagining become laugh- 
able rather than terrible. 

“G. O. G. 666,” otherwise 
known as “Gog,” is a Russian 



genetic experiment, half ape, half 
human; and in the end the mon- 
ster proves to be more “human” 
than his Soviet makers. 

The story is tortuous and 
wordy, and will add nothing to 
its author’s reputation. 

BRIEF NOTES. Dover Publi- 
cations has just reissued Sir Wil- 
liam Bragg’s Concerning the 
Nature of Things ($1.25 in 
paper), first published in 1925. 
It’s a study of the atom in the 
fixed-electron period, and has a 
great deal that’s useful and easy 
to understand on the nature of 
gases, liquids, and various types 
of crystals. Excellent for the be- 
ginner . The British H. J. 
Campbell has edited Sprague de 
Camp’s New Anthology (around 
35c from most science fiction spe- 
cialist stores); it contains six of 
de Camp’s usual brand of light 
stories . Bradford Day, 127-01 
116th Ave., S. Ozone Park, N.W., 
has issued An Index to the Weird 
and Fantastica in Magazines 
($2.00, mimeo.); it contains the 
tables of contents of all of Weird 
T ales plus seven other short- 
lived magazines of the same na- 
ture, and incomplete listings of 
similar material from over two 
dozen other magazines. No au- 
thor or story title lists, but it 
should be a useful compilation to 
lovers of this type of fiction.

which, after all, is but an expression 
of a natural psycho-biological charac- 
teristic. 

The letter was signed by the 
Secretary of the Bureau. 

Impatiently, she slid it back 
into its envelope and stared help- 
lessly at her husband. 

“No soap?” Bob asked tenta- 
tively. 

Clara sighed. “He says we have 
to put up with the child — that it’s 
just unfortunate the Consul hap- 
pens to live in our neighborhood.” 
“I told you so.” 

The voices of children in va- 
cation-time play shrilled through 
the window. With much more 
abandon, Clara imagined, than at 
any time since Jebaburba — 
“Jeb,” the kids called him — and 
his diplomat father had moved 
into the large house on the corner. 

“What are we going to do, 
Bob?” she asked worriedly. 

“I’m going to take the express 
downtown. I’ll be at the office 
for approximately two hours.” 
He rose, glancing at his watch. 
“Then I’ll be at the golf course 
for the rest of the day.” 

She frowned irritably. “I’m 
serious, Bob. Something can be 
done. You could call our Con- 
gressman and — ” 

He laughed and kissed her on 
the forehead. “Neighborhood 
gossip, Mrs. Smith’s new hat, in- 
corrigible children — all in the 
same category — woman’s re- 



sponsibility. You take care of the 
domestic headaches; I’ll take care 
of the business ones. Anyway, all 
Jeb needs is the application of 
a hand to the seat of the trousers, 
which I hardly think is my priv- 
ilege.” 

“But—” 

But Bob was already out the 
door and she was alone. Or was 
she? 

H esitantly, she glanced 

around the room — listening, 
staring apprehensively into each 
corner. 

“Jeb?” she said softly. 

A coincidental surge in the 
clamor outside, spawned by the 
gang play beneath the window, 
was the only answer. The exuber- 
ant childish laughter was unin- 
hibited now — as though the 
restraint of having someone ‘dif- 
ferent’ among them was gone for 
the moment. 

“Jeb,” she called more loudly. 
Tensing, she realized instinc- 
tively that he was there — just a 
shade below the level of concrete 
presence — watching, listening. 
She could feel it in the special 
stillness around her. 

A piece of marmalade-covered 
toast elevated itself, moved 
through the air and disappeared. 

Clara lurched up, knocking her 
chair over. “Jeb!” 

“Yes, ma’am.” The thin voice 
came from nowhere. 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“You come out this instant, 
Jeb!” 

The air to one side of the table 
wavered tremulously, then belch- 
ed forth a lean, tousled-haired 
five-year-old. Orange jam cover- 
ed only a few of the multitudin- 
ous freckles on his face. 

She stared at him, speechless 
in her exasperation. 

He licked his fingers. 

“Whatcha doing, huh, Mrs. 
Peterson?” 

Clara took in a profound 
breath, then calmed herself in 
the superficial gesture of smooth- 
ing out the bodice of her dress. 
“Jeb, you will go home to your 
father and tell him that you were 
snooping again!” 

“Yes’m. May I have another 
slice of bread?” 

“Jeb!” 

The child looked away sheep- 
ishly and disappeared. 

There was a scream from the 
breakfast room of the Sanders’ 
home next door. Then Jeb was 
back, another slice of toast and 
jelly in his hand. 

“Mrs. Sanders’ jelly is better, 
anyway,” he testified before he 
disappeared a second time. 

Outside, the gleeful cries of the 
children were snipped off, as 
though the window had been 
closed against them. 

Clara glanced out. She had 
guessed right. The child was with 
the others now and they were 



standing around, staring uneasily 
at him. 

“Let’s play catcher,” Jeb said. 

“Not with you,” Clara’s Bob- 
by protested. 

“Not with you! Not with you!” 
Katherine and Mary chanted. 

“No, thit!” David declared, his 
four-year-old lisp flourishing in 
his indignation. “Mommy thayth 
for me to thtay away from you.” 

“You’re always viva — viva — ” 
Sammy, six, struggled with the 
word. “Viva-something.” 

Katherine turned to run home. 
“I think Mommy’s calling me.” 

Jeb, grinning mischievously, 
dropped to his hands and knees, 
his back arched high like a cat. 

He disappeared. 

He rematerialized instantly a 
foot in front of the running Kath- 
erine. Her knees struck his back 
and she catapulted over him, 
screaming in terror. 

“TJ E A L L Y , Mr. T’Arah,” 
-I*- Clara said stiffly, “we are 
all of the opinion that something 
should be done about Jeb — 
Jebaburba.” 

The Consul General of Dartha 
proceeded to wipe his glasses. He 
tactfully avoided looking at the 
caller he had received in his 
study. “Of course you realize, 
Mrs. Peterson, that none of us 
Darthanians condones such be- 
havior on the part of our chil- 
dren.” 



JEBABURBA 



103 



Clara smiled hopefully. “Then 
you’ll see that he doesn’t do it 
again?” 

T’Arah’s responsive smile was 
weak and hopeless. “You have a 
suggestion as to how Jebaburba 
can be corrected?” 

“Physical persuasion in the 
right place. Now if my Bobby 
should — ” 

T’Arah laughed. “I assure you, 
Mrs. Peterson, that your custom 
of spanking would be quite frus- 
trating if a Darthanian tried it on 
his child. He would be spanking 
nothing. Dematerialization, as 
you call it, is a defense mechan- 
ism. A child uses it instinctively.” 
“You could punish him some 
other way, then!” 

“Lock him in a room, per- 
haps?” 

Clara rose. “Very well, Mr. 
T’Arah—” 

He sprang to his feet. “Don’t 
misinterpret, please. I am very 
much in sympathy with you and 
your neighbors. It is my job to 
promote cordiality with other 
peoples. But punitive measures 
such as Earthmen practice can’t 
be applied to Darthanian chil- 
dren. On Darthan, we have to 
be patient — wait until they reach 
the age of understanding — make 
allowances for the fact that a five- 
year-old is motivated by an in- 
satiable curiosity.” 

His sympathy and apparent 
eagerness to pacify were convinc- 



ing. Hopefully, Clara returned 
to her seat. 

“Believe me, Mrs. Peterson,” 
T’Arah went on, “I shall try 
again to make him understand. 
But Jebaburba is only .a child. 
Have you tried to reason with 
your -five -year-old?” 

“But isn’t there anything we 
can do?” 

“I’m afraid not — short of re- 
questing my removal. If you de- 
cide on that, I shan’t oppose the 
move. I understand your posi- 
tion.” 

He paused, then added, “On 
the other hand, you might be 
surprised to know that while my 
son and I present a problem in 
this neighborhood, there are 
Earth consuls whose presence on 
other worlds is equally trying to 
the inhabitants of those planets.” 

She looked puzzled. 

“You see, Darthanians, too,

It was a tactful reminder that 
his neighbors could be more 
neighborly and Clara felt some- 
what embarrassed for her dis- 
courteous attitude.

YWTARAH folded his arms pen- 
sively and leaned back in the 
chair. “Jebaburba was a problem 
on my last assignment, too — in 
Europe. He was playfully aggres- 
sive toward one small girl, teased 
her so much with his vivaporting 
that we feared the child might 
become neurotic. We cured him 
by eliminating his superiority 
over her. She was instructed in 
the practice of vivaporting and, 
when he learned she was his 
equal, he no longer — ” 

“Are you suggesting, Mr. 
T’Arah, that I learn how to flit 
into nowhere and back again?” 
Clara asked, raising an eyebrow. 

“Of course not, Mrs. Peterson. 
I fear that would be impossible. 
You lack the — uh — flexibility nec- 
essary to acquire the ability. All 
Earthmen and Earthwomen do. 
However, there is a possibility of 
canceling out Jebaburba’s sense 
of superiority, much as we did in 
Europe. I hadn’t mentioned it un- 
til now because I doubt seri- 
ously that I can arrange for the 
equipment.” 

Clara looked up, interested. 

“But since you’re so distress- 
ed, I’m willing to try. I’m going 
to put in a requisition with the 
Darthanian Diplomatic Corps for 
a vivaflux muzzle.” 

“You mean there is something 
to keep Jebaburba from popping 
up out of nowhere?” she asked in- 
credulously. 

JEBABURBA 



“The muzzle will completely 
stifle his vivaportive ability — as 
surely as a blindfold would pre- 
vent you from seeing. Our Diplo- 
matic Corps has seven muzzles, 
available only in emergencies. I 
doubt that this situation will be 
classified as an emergency, but 
I’m willing to put in the requisi- 
tion.” 

“But a — a muzzle! Will it hurt? 
Will it affect Jeb?” 

“Not at all. It is simply a 
bracelet of vivaportive-resistant 
material that can be locked on 
his wrist. But I don’t want to 
raise your hopes unwarrantedly. 
I repeat, it is extremely unlikely 
that one will be available.” 

The air stirred close to Clara’s 
elbow and she gasped, leaped 
aside as Jeb sprang into exis- 
tence. 

“ ’Lo, Mrs. Peterson.” The 
child looked up at her, smiling. 
“Where’s Bobby?” 

“Jebaburba,” T’Arah began 
with proper parental severity, “I 
want you to stop vivaporting. 
You’re not at home now and — ” 

“ ’Scuse me,” the boy said ab- 
stractedly and vanished. 

But he was back again in a 
second, fondling a large Maltese 
cat that Clara recognized as be- 
longing to the Donnors. 

T’Arah scowled at the boy. 
“Jebaburba! You will return that 
animal — now!” 

“Yes, Daddy.” 



105 



“And you will not vivaport 
again!” 

“Yes, Daddy,” he said, disap- 
pearing. 

B UT the next week was no 
more peaceful than the two 
months since T’Arah had moved 
into the large gray house and sub- 
jected himself and his son to the 
linguisticators for instant assi- 
milation of the language. 

On Monday, the Donnors’ cat, 
Gabby, vanished. 

Jebaburba’s fondness for the 
animal immediately attracted 
suspicion to him. But a visit by 
the Donnors, accompanied by the 
Sanderses, to T’Arah’s house 
failed to draw from the child an 
admission that he was implicated 
in its disappearance. 

Perhaps the Donnors would 
have been willing to let the mat- 
ter drop. Gabby might have 
stolen off to seek subsistence in 
a more normal neighborhood. But 
shortly befbre midnight, the ani- 
mal’s frenzied wails fetched John 
Donnor from his bed. No ques- 
tion of it — it was Gabby. 

A search of the house produced 
no Gabby, despite the fact that 
his wailing was mysteriously 
loudest in the center of the bed- 
room. 

John bracketed the spot of 
apparent origin of the animal’s 
cries and, deciding he should now 
be standing over the creature, 



reached down, groping, as 
though he might be able to feel 
what he couldn’t see. 

Infuriated, the Donnors, escort- 
ed this time by the Sanderses and 
Clara, paid a midnight visit to 
T’Arah. It seemed that now Jeba- 
burba could remember playing 
with the animal in the late after- 
noon. 

“Where did you leave him?” 
T’Arah demanded. 

Jebaburba looked up sleepily 
from his pillow. “I think I had 
him when I went from Bobby’s 
house to see David.” He looked 
at David’s mother for confirma- 
tion. 

Ethel Sanders shook her head. 
“He popped up at the side of the 
supper table, wanting to play 
with David. But Gabby wasn’t 
with him.” 

"Think, Jebaburba!” his father 
insisted. “What did you do with 
the animal?” 

But the child was asleep. 

The Consul General sighed dis- 
tastefully, tightening his robe 
around him. 

“I’ll find the cat.” 

“Where?” Clara asked dubi- 
ously. 

“Where? Somewhere in the 
subvivaplane, of course. Mr. 
Sanders says he can hear the 
animal in his bedroom.” 

The posse, with its one quali- 
fied searcher, returned to the 
Donnor home. T’Arah stood stif- 



106

fly in the center of the bedroom. 
Then he disappeared. 

A moment later, he was back, 
hastily disentangling himself 
from a frightened, clawing Gab- 
by. 

That was on Monday. 

O N Tuesday, Jebaburba seem- 
ed somehow to win the con- 
fidence of the children and gain 
acceptance into their games. 

Clara stood at the breakfast 
room window and Watched them 
sitting silently in the shade of the 
small oak — doing nothing more 
harmful than telling stories, she 
hoped. 

“Why don’t you forget about 
those kids?” Bob asked from the 
table. 

He was rested and alert, not 
having been disturbed in the least 
by Gabby’s outcries during the 
night. 

“I’m worried about them, 
Bob,” she said. “Suppose some- 
thing should happen?” 

“Happen?” he repeated dense- 
ly. 

She went over to him. “That 
child — Jebaburba. He might 
be — dangerous !” 

Bob laughed. “Darling, aren’t 
you trying to make something 
serious out of nothing?” 

“He made the cat disappear. 
Suppose — ” 

“Nonsense. You’re upsetting 
yourself over nothing. If you’re 



worried, just refuse to let Bobby 
play with him.” 

She laughed mirthlessly. “Jeb’s 
in and out of this house fifty 
times a day — even through lock- 
ed doors. / could keep Bobby 
away from a child like that?” 
“Even if you could,” he said, 
shrugging, “I guess you should- 
n’t. The Secretary of the Bureau 
has asked that we do everything 
we can to adapt to the situation. 
Ostracizing a diplomat’s child 
wouldn’t help matters any. Any- 
how, Jeb isn’t a bad kid. Un- 
usual, that’s all.” 

“Not dangerous?” 

“Of course not. T’Arah can’t 
allow it, so relax. Nothing to 
worry about.” 

After he had gone, she turned 
back to watch the children. They 
were no longer on the lawn. Now 
she could hear their playful cries 
coming from inside the garage. 

Wednesday, Jebaburba seem- 
ed to lose his interest in the chil- 
dren and concentrated on the 
adults with his unintentionally 
harassing behavior. 

“Really,” Lucy Donnor told 
Clara over the visiphone, “I 
don’t believe I can put up with 
that child another day. He’s been 
in here a thousand times.” 

“I find,” Clara advised, “that 
he eventually loses interest and 
leaves you alone for a while if 
you ignore him.” 

“Ignore him? How can you ig- 



JEBABURBA

nore anything like that? I put 
Mary and Katherine in their 
room for disrespect to their 
father. Jeb kept them company 
for a whole hour, without my 
knowing anything about it, un- 
til I heard the rumpus upstairs.” 

T HE visiscreen flickered, then 
split in half, showing two face 
frames. Maud Clark joined the 
conversation. 

“Frank and I have decided to 
take our vacation early,” she 
said. “We’ve got to get away from 
that child. We’ve got to get 
Sammy away.” 

Lucy shrugged despairingly. 
“What good will that do? He’ll 
be here when you get back.” 
“It’ll do a lot of good! Why, 
that child was under our feet 
half the morning, without our 
knowing it! And the things we 
were talking about! Personal 
things that families discuss — 
you know.” 

“I know, all right!” Lucy 
agreed emphatically. 

“You can’t ever tell when he’s 
there,” Clara complained. 

“Who you talking about, huh, 
Mrs. Peterson?” 

Clara whirled around, gasping. 
Jebaburba stood looking up in- 
quisitively at her. She snapped 
off the visiphone, wondering why 
she felt guilty about being sur- 
prised in the conversation. 

“People like to talk about 



other people, don’t they?” the 
child observed, glancing past her 
at the fading screen. 

“Now, Jeb,” Clara scolded, 
“that doesn’t concern you at all.” 
The Consul’s son laughed. 
“That’s what Mrs. Sanders told 
me. I heard her telling Mr. San- 
ders that Mrs. Donnor’s new 
drapes are at — atros — atrosicus. 
And I asked her what atrosicus 
was and she said — ” 

Clara seized him by the shoul- 
ders and spun him around, pro- 
pelling him gently, yet with 'de- 
termination, toward the door. 

“I don’t care to hear what 
Mrs. Sanders says about Mrs. 
Donnor.” 

“But she says things about 
you, too. She said Clara — your 
name’s Clara, isn’t it? — has a lazy 
husband. Is Mr. Peterson lazy?” 
“Jeb! If you don’t leave, I’m 
going right to your father!” _ 
“Oh, heck!” he protested. 

But he gave in — he disappear- 
ed. 

Even before Clara could let out 
a breath of relief, however, he 
was back. “Mrs. Donnor says 
Mr. Peterson is lazy, too. So it 
must be true, huh?” 

She reached out impulsively for 
his ear. 

Her hand closed on nothing. 

O N Thursday, the unexpected 
appearance of Jebaburba at 
the table, as she and Bobby were 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



eating lunch, drove Clara to the 
limit of her patience. It wasn’t 
because she dropped the platter 
of cold cuts on the floor. She had 
been in a keen state of nervous 
anxiety all morning, anticipating 
his inevitable arrival while she 
traced, via visiphone, his wander- 
ings through the neighborhood. 
And now suddenly, shockingly, 
he was here. 

The tension exploded in a flow 
of near-hysterical tears and she 
rudely ordered him from the 
house in a tone so severe that 
he left without a protest. 

Another talk — a desperate 
one this time — with the Consul 
General was in order. She left 
the kitchen without even clean- 
ing up the mess. 

Absently, she drew water for 
her bath, wondering how she 
could make T’Arah search for 
some way to force his son to 
observe the customs of Earth. It 
was evident by now that no viva- 
flux muzzle would be coming 
from Dartha — if it were, it would 
already have arrived. 

She might influence his father 
to send Jebaburba back to Dar- 
tha, for a while at least. That 
hope heartened her as she un- 
dressed and slipped into the tub 
of warm water. 

She sighed, lathering herself 
briskly. At this interview, she 
was determined, there would be 
no concessions. 



Bobby’s knock sounded at the 
door. “Mommy, can I go out 
and play?” 

“Yes, dear. But stay clean. 
Your father’ll be home in a little 
while.” 

“I will.” 

“And, Bobby — don’t play with 
Jeb if you can avoid it.” 

“Why, Mommy?” 

“Never mind why. If he shows 
up and wants to play with you 
and the other children, you come 
back inside.” 

“Oh, out Jeb’s fun now. He 
used to be mean and he used to 
play tricks on us. But . .” 
The din of children’s voices 
rose from outside, drowning out 
her son’s words. 

“Never mind that,” she said 
after the clamor had subsided. 
“Stay away from him. Don’t hurt 
his feelings. Just excuse yourself 
and come in the house.” 

In the silence, she could sense 
her boy standing sullenly outside 
the bathroom. 

“And, Bobby,” she called, “if 
he tries to — take you anywhere, 
like he did the cat, you tell him 
you won’t go.” 

There was no answer. 

“Bobby! I know you’re out 
there!” She stared at the door 
impatiently. “You’d better an- 
swer me!” Considering the way 
he customarily stomped down the 
hall, it was ridiculous for the 
child to believe he could deceive 



JEBABURBA

He left the wash basin and 
started over toward her, con- 
cerned. 

“Get away!” Clara warned, 
near tears as she squirmed side- 
ways and grabbed for the towel 
hanging from its rack. 

She managed to float it over 
her just as Jebaburba reached the 
side of the tub. She cringed in 
horror from the child. 

“You all right, Mrs. Peterson?” 
“Get out!” she screamed. “Get 
out! You — you little monster!” 
Jebaburba’s eyes opened wide. 



Then he backed away, starting 
to cry. 

“You don’t like me! Nobody 
likes me and I wish I was some- 
where else!” 

“Then go home — do anything 
— but get out of here!” 

His sobs became more crush- 
ing and his face flushed until his 
freckles were hardly noticeable. 

Bewildered, Clara stared at 
him. After all, he was only a 
child. She found her robe and 
squirmed into it. 

Then she knelt before him and 



her into thinking he’d left. 

“Bobby’s outside, play ini, 
Mrs. Peterson.” 



C LARA lurched up, splashing 
a wave of water on the floor. 
Jebaburba was standing next to 
the wash basin, playing with the 
faucets. 

She slumped down again, send- 
ing another billow over the rim 
of the tub as she snatched for the 
washrag to hold in front of her. 
“Gee, Mrs. Peterson. Are you

held him by the shoulders. “Don’t 
you know, Jeb, that you can’t 
just pop up in people’s bath- 
rooms?” 

“I can’t?” He looked up at 
her, surprised. “Why, Mrs. Peter- 
son?” 

Her mouth twisted helplessly. 
“Never mind, Jeb. Just go on 
outside and play.” 

“And you’re not mad at me 
any more?” he asked eagerly. 

“Go out and play, Jeb,” she 
insisted. “We’ll talk about that 
later on.” 

He smiled. Then he was gone. 

She glanced uncertainly at the 
tub, considering a quick rinse. 
But she prudently decided 
against it. 

A HALF-HOUR later, after 
she had dressed nervously, 
she was next door in the San- 
ders’ living room, relating her 
experience to the other girls in 
a hastily convened council on 
strategy. 

“This morning,” said Ethel, 
when Clara was through, “I had 
to chase him out of the bedroom 
before I could get out of bed.” 
Maud shook her head discon- 
solately. “And I finally found out 
what happened to that stole I left 
on the hall rack last night. I 
had to plead with him to get it 
from — from wherever he usually 
hides things.” 

“Well!" Lucy exclaimed in 



desperation. “I’m willing to do 
anything after finding him play- 
ing with my Mary and Katherine 
in the downstairs hall last night 
— two hours after we had all 
gone to bed!” 

Clara confronted the group. 
“Suppose we call on Mr. T’Arah 
and explain just what has been 
happening?” 

“Some of it will be rather em- 
barrassing,” Maud said. 

“Do you think he’ll under- 
stand our position?” Ethel ask- 
ed. 

“We’ll make him!” Clara 
clenched her fists in determina- 
tion. “We’ll tell him that there’s 
too wide a difference between 
Earth and Darthanian customs 
and we can’t allow our children 
to play with Jebaburba.” 

Lucy, standing by the window, 
turned around. “They’re all play- 
ing with him now,” she announc- 
ed. “They’re in the shed again.” 

“We’ll put a stop to that!” 
declared Ethel angrily. “We’ll — ” 

She stopped, looking past the 
other women at her son, who was 
standing in the doorway. 

“What is it, David?” she asked, 
annoyed. 

He came over and pulled her 
down to whisper in her ear. 

“Gone?” she repeated. “Gone 
where?” 

The child whispered again. 

“Speak up, David!” Ethel or- 
dered. “What about Bobby?” 



112 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Bobby!” Clara cried in alarm. 
David turned to her. “He’th 
gone. Jeb held hith hand un- 
der the tree and they went to 
the shed. Only, when Jeb got in 
the shed, Bobby was gone.” 

“Oh, no!” Clara whispered 
hoarsely. “Oh, Lord, no!" She 
clutched the boy’s arms frantical- 
ly. “They walked to the shed?” 
“No, ma’am. Jeb viva — viva 
— he wath juth trying to show 
him how to go away.” 

Sobbing frantically, Clara led 
the exodus from the house. 

OAMMY, running up the steps, 
^ intercepted them. Maud stop- 
ped to lift him into her arms. 

“Where’s Bobby?” she de- 
manded. 

“Gone, Momma. He’s gone.” 
Clara bit back a scream. 
“Where’s Jeb?” Maud asked. 
“He’s gone, too.” 

“Oh, God!” Clara pleaded as 
they raced across the lawn to- 
ward Katherine and Mary, who 
were standing helplessly under 
the tree next to the driveway. 

“Jeb’s daddy called him,” 
Sammy explained. “He had to go 
home.” 

Clara hardly noticed Lucy 
clutching Mary and Katherine to 
her. 

“Bobby!” she shouted. “Bob- 
by! Where are you!” 

“Bobby?” Ethel said weakly, 
groping as though in the dark. 



“Are you here, Bobby?” 
Frantically, Clara moved in 
aimless circles around the yard, 
in and out of the garage and 
shed and around the tree, terror 
making her steps unsteady. 

She tried to calm herself. He 
had to be safe! He had to be 
somewhere nearby — even though 
it might be in what was nowhere 
to Jeb and his father. The Don- 
nors’ cat had disappeared and 
had come back safely, hadn’t it? 
But they had known the animal 
was near. They had heard its 
cries. Why couldn’t she hear 
Bobby speaking? Why couldn’t 
she hear him calling for her? 

Exhausted, she dropped to the 
bench under the trees. Ethel came 
over and put her arm around her. 

“Don’t get excited, Clara,” she 
comforted. “Maud’s gone to get 
Mr. T’Arah. He’ll do something.” 
In the panic that stifled her, 
the nightmares of all the possible 
things that could be happening to 
her son raced terrifyingly through 
her mind. 

S HE was crying uncontrollably 
when the heavy hand touched 
her shoulder. She looked up into 
the Consul General’s face. 

“Don’t be frightened, Mrs. 
Peterson,” T’Arah said. “There’s 
no danger. We’ll get Bobby 
back.” 

“Where is he?” she sobbed. 
“Where is he?” 



JEBABURBA 



113 



“He’s only in the subvivaplane 
— where the Donnors’ cat was. 
We’ll have him back in a mo- 
ment. And, Mrs. Peterson, you’ll 
be glad to hear that the viviflux 
muzzle got here. I’ve already 
locked it on Jebaburba’s wrist. 
He’s behaving just like your 
Earth children now.” 

There was no feeling of re- 
lief. “Get Bobby,” she pleaded. 

T’Arah turned around and 
whipped out of sight. 

A minute passed — five — fifteen. 
The women stood around speech- 
lessly. Katherine and Mary and 
Sammy and David huddled fear- 
fully next to the house. 

T’Arah burst into existence in 
front of them, frowning in vex- 
ation. 

“They went via either a second 
or a third subplane, I imagine,” 
he explained embarrassedly. “It 
may take a little longer, Mrs. 
Peterson, but I’ll find him.” 

T’Arah vanished once more. 

Clara, afflicted with an almost 
numbing anxiety, waited. 

Jebaburba crossed the street 
and stood well away from the 
women, compassionately watch- 
ing them and the children. The 
metallic bracelet on his wrist, 
locked there with a key, glisten- 
ed as the sunlight struck it. 

He came over. “Gee, Mrs. Pet- 
erson, I was only trying to show 
the . 

Clara wept and turned from 



him. Ethel made a disgruntled 
sound that was somewhat like a 
growl. 

“I didn’t think . the child 
began again contritely. “You see, 
with David and Sammy and 
Katherine and Mary . 

M AUD glowered at him, raised 
a finger to shake it in his 
face. Then, exasperated, she 
sighed and turned from the child, 
too. 

Jebaburba glanced at the other 
children. “Can I go play with 
them, huh? Can I play with 
them, Mrs. Donnor?” 

Lucy drew her shoulders back 
threateningly and stepped toward 
the child, reaching for him. 

Ethel stopped her. “He’s only 
a little — ” 

T’Arah popped into view be- 
fore them — with Bobby. 

Clara grasped the child and 
held him desperately, crying into 
his tousled blond hair. 

“There, now,” T’Arah said 
proudly. “Didn’t I tell you every- 
thing would be all right?” 

“Gee, Mom,” Bobby exclaim- 
ed reassuringly, “I wasn’t lost 
— not really. Jeb didn’t have 
anything to do with it. I was 
trying . .” 

But Clara pulled him more 
tightly against her, squeezing the 
breath from him. “Oh, Bobby! 
Bobby!" 

After a long while, she smiled 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



and bravely wiped the tears from 
her face. 

T’Arah beamed, rubbed his 
hands together enthusiastically. 
“Now all our problems seem to 
be solved. You had no idea how 
concerned I was over the fact that 
Jebaburba wasn’t being fully ac- 
cepted by you and your chil- 
dren.” 

He held his son’s arm up so all 
could see the bracelet. “But 
everything’s all right now. And 
he’ll be able to play with them 
as much as he wants without an- 
noying anybody.” 

The women looked guardedly 
at one another. 

“Can I play with the kids 
now?” Jebaburba pleaded with 
all of them. 

’ “Do you object to his asso- 
ciating with them?” T’Arah ask- 
ed cautiously. 

Clara glanced at the other wo- 
men. Lucy and Ethel shook their 



heads. Maud smiled briefly. 

“Of course not, Mr. T’Arah,” 
Clara said. “Certainly Jeb can 
play with the children. 

Jebaburba emitted a whoop 
and lunged across the lawn, seem- 
ingly unconcerned about the viva- 
flux muzzle and the restraint it 
put on him. 

All the children were happy. 
The girls and David and Sammy 
held hands and raced into the 
garage. Jebaburba and Clara’s 
boy followed more slowly. 

“Come on, Bobby,” the alien’s 
son coaxed as they neared the 
door. “We’ll start with . .” 

T’Arah turned to thq, women. 

“Both Dartha and myself are 
indebted to you ladies for dem- 
onstrating the extreme diplomatic 
usefulness of the vivaflux muz- 
zles. Although there are no more 
available now, within three years 
we expect to be able to start pro- 
duction on many others.”

JEBABURBA 



115 



I N her bedroom, Clara was 
a battlefield for the conflict 
between exhaustion and relief 
that raged within her. Numb 
from the experiences of the day, 
she drew down the shades and 
undressed, stretching across the 
bed secure in the knowledge 
there was no more danger for her 
son — no more possibility of her 
being surprised by the innocent 
but appallingly curious Jeba- 
burba. 

She was almost asleep when 
the sharp cry sounded, alarming- 
ly close. 

She sat up in bed. 

Sammy, grinning, leaped from 
the dresser and landed on the 
floor. Mary materialized on the 
dresser and sprang down as Sam- 
my hopped onto the bed and 
disappeared, shouting gleefully. 
When Mary reached the spot of 
Sammy’s disappearance, Kather- 
ine and Bobby popped into exist- 
ence atop the dresser. 

“Follow the leader! Follow the 



leader!” cried Bobby exuberant- 
ly. Then he spied his dum- 
founded mother. “Didja see, 
Mom? I can really do it now, 
can’t I?” 

On the bed, he vanished, too. 

But Katherine didn’t. 

Bobby reappeared beside her. 
Clara stared up at them in grim 
stupefaction. 

“Come on, Katy,” Bobby 
urged, taking her hand. “Follow 
the leader! It’s easy. Do it just 
like Jeb showed us.” 

The two children dematerial- 
ized abruptly and Sammy reap- 
peared — close to the wall, running 
across the floor. 

Clara, tearing herself from the 
paralysis of horrified bewilder- 
ment, clutched a sheet about her, 
raced into the closet and slam- 
med the door. 

Two tiny hands landed grub- 
bily against her. 

“Boo, Mithuth Peterthon! 
Which way did they go?”

IT’S A DEAL! 






Co rvey lived, laughed, loved, killed and 
died a thousand times . but which one of 
all these lifetimes was actually his own? 



C ORVEY fought it off until 
he had finished writing 
his story, read it through, 
put it down the chute, glanced 
through all the odds and ends 
which piled up every day on a 
survey reporter’s desk and check- 
ed with the feature sub-editors 
to make sure there were no quer- 
ies about his story. Only then 



did he leave the Star building. 

He held it off while he walked 
the three blocks to the Jewel 
Cafe. He would have preferred 
taking a taxi or even a bus, for 
his legs felt rubbery and his head 
ached with a quiet, subdued, mo- 
notonous throb that swelled with 
every jarring step and ebbed as 
he forced one shaky, uncertain

leg past the other. But buses and 
particularly taxis were danger- 
ously soothing. It was safer, 
though less pleasant, to walk. 

It was a constantly recurring 
question whether to frequent 
places where he was known and 
would arouse no real suspicion 
even if his behavior were strange, 
or places where he was unknown 
but might be remembered as a 
queer character if anything hap- 
pened. On previous occasions, ex- 
pecting something, he had been 
able to decide one way or the 
other was safer. Tonight he did- 
n’t feel he had the energy to cope 
with a new restaurant. He went 
to the Jewel automatically, hop- 
ing that he would go on acting 
automatically, behaving as he had 
on hundreds of other evenings. 

He fought it off while he went 
into the cafe, found a dark cor- 
ner well out of the way, smiled 
in his usual friendly but unsug- 
gestive manner at Rosie, the pret- 
tiest waitress, and ordered ham 
and eggs. 

fT’HE Jewel was a pleasant 
refuge for people whose apart- 
ments were merely places to 
sleep and shave in the mornings. 
It was unpretentious, shabby 
without being dirty, and the food 
showed a reasonable balance be- 
tween quality and expense. If one 
wanted no more than a cup of 
coffee, that was all right. If one 



wanted seven courses, that was 
all right, too. 

When he had his food in front 
of him, he was able at last to 
loosen the desperate grip he had 
been keeping on himself all day. 
Little by little he let go, the re- 
lief of being able to relax spread- 
ing delightfully through him in a 
warm, grateful flood. 

It was ironic, almost irritat- 
ing, to find that, when he did let 
go, nothing happened. He would- 
n’t have known if anything had, 
but it was possible to be almost 
sure of the negative. You didn’t 
know you were dreaming when 
you were. You could always, how- 
ever, satisfy yourself that you 
were not. 

In places where he wasn’t 
known, he could never quite let 
go. When things were unfamiliar 
anyway, it was all the more dif- 
ficult to keep in touch with real- 
ity. The corresponding disadvan- 
tage of going to a place like the 
Jewel was that people were liable 
not to leave him alone. 

He had barely started on his 
ham and eggs when a breath of 
familiar crushed-petal perfume, 
mingled with a whiff of light, dry 
pipe tobacco, announced Babs 
and Dave Andrews. 

Without looking up he said, 
“No, none of these seats are 
taken.’’ 

“There he goes again,” Babs 
exclaimed, “making out that we 



120 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



smell.” She folded herself vio- 
lently around him from behind 
and kissed him moistly. Babs was 
one of those young wives who 
have a habit of making love to 
other men in their husband’s com- 
pany. She still startled Corvey 
occasionally. He was rather glad 
that he had never met Babs with- 
out Dave. 

She dropped lightly in the chair 
on one side of him, while Dave 
settled himself more ponderously 
on the other side. 

“You look tired, Ken,” Dave 
observed. 

“I am. Dead beat.” 

“But not off your feed, I see.” 

“Hell, I’m only tired, not ill.” 

“You’ve been tired a lot late- 
ly.” Babs sounded concerned. 

It was vexing how shrewd and 
observant people could be when 
you didn’t want them to be 
shrewd and observant. 

“It’s nothing,” Corvey said, 
shrugging. “You know the news- 
paper business — you have to be 
up a little earlier than the next 
fellow, work a little harder, be a 
little cleverer, find out a little 
more. It’s not surprising that you 
finish the day tired.” 

“You should get your doctor 
to give you a check-up, all the 
same.” 

Ken Corvey shrugged as if it 
didn’t matter. 

Of course it mattered. Dave 
was right — he needed medical at- 



tention. But he simply couldn’t 
risk it. All he could do, when the 
subject came up, was to treat it 
casually and hope it would soon 
be dropped. 

Babs was small, light, quick 
and restless. She always sat for- 
ward on the edge of her chair, as 
if on the point of leaping in the 
air like a frog. Dave was heavy, 
slow and clumsy, like an overfed 
dog. He looked older than Babs, 
which wasn’t so. As nearly as 
they could reason, Babs had been 
born thirty-six minutes before 
him, although they hadn’t met 
until twenty-two years later. 
When they did, it was immediate- 
ly obvious — to them, at any rate 
— that they were made for each 
other. They were married within 
six weeks and, in the intervening 
seven years, had frequently con- 
gratulated each other on their 
perspicacity. 

A NOTHER illusion was ex- 
ploded when they stripped 
for swimming. Corvey had al- 
ready had it exploded for him, 
but he noticed it forcibly once 
more the time he met them at the 
Rutledge Country Club. 

He had driven out for a swim 
that he hoped would kill the dull 
headache and, though he looked 
squarely at the man who had 
been changing into swimming 
trunks in the next cubicle, he 
almost passed him without a

sign of recognition — for Dave, 
when dressed, appeared to be 
fat, flabby and out of condition. 
This man was burly and power- 
ful, with a very handsome torso. 
Still, it was Dave, all right. 

“Pretending not to notice me, 
huh?” Dave inquired, which was 
quite a good crack, since he 
weighed over 200 pounds. 

And then, as they made their 
way to the pool, with Corvey 
still casting occasional incredul- 
ous glances at the you-too-can- 
have-a-body-like-mine character 
with him, Babs emerged from the 
women’s dressing-rooms — and 
she was as big a surprise as Dave, 
in reverse. Babs, in clothes, seem- 
ed wonderful. Obviously, she 
should never put on beachwear. 
Her knees were too bony, her 
thighs too thin, her stomach too 
flat, the cage of her ribs too 
visible, her collar-bone positively 
scrawny. Her bathing suit left no 
figure fault unrevealed. 

Dave showed himself still in 
love with her, by saying admir- 
ingly, “Isn’t she gorgeous?” And 
believing it. 

They swam for twenty minutes 
or so, which was enough for Cor- 
vey to lose his headache. After- 
ward, sprawled in the late after- 
noon Sun, Dave and Babs asked 
him about his job, just making 
conversation. 

“What is a survey reporter, 
anyway?” Babs asked. 



“Survey reporting is a fairly 
new thing,” he told them. “Re- 
member the old polls, public 
opinion surveys, random samples 
and all the rest of it? I just do 
the same job without the expense 
of the survey.” 

“You mean you guess?” 

“No, I get my results by a 
short-cut. The main difficulty in 
any random sample prediction or 
test was always the random part 
of it. If you wanted to know how 
a billion people were going to 
react, you couldn’t be sure you 
did know, even if you tested a 
million. Your method of collect- 
ing the million might have been 
biased. 

“But if you could be sure you 
really had a random group, your 
million would be quite enough. In 
fact, if there was any way of 
knowing that ten people were 
truly representative, they’d be 
enough. There was no way until 
recently — so, merely to cancel out 
bias, it was necessary to take vast 
samples. Hundreds, thousands, 
even tens of thousands.” 

“You say, ‘until recently,’ ” 
Dave observed. “I should say for- 
ever and ever. How can you pos- 
sibly be sure ten people are 
properly representative?” 

“We can’t, really,” Corvey 
admitted. “I’m oversimplifying, 
of course. There was always what 
was known as a weighted sample. 
The statisticians limited the num- 



122 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ber of the sample by making it 
a cross-section. Doctor, lawyer, 
Indian chief. Following up this 
principle of weighing, I can gen- 
erally get from a few small sets — 
in a series of tests — the same re- 
sult I’d get from a huge random 
sample. It’s a method of eliminat- 
ing ' bias by mathematics and 
common sense.” 

“Bet you’re often wrong,” Babs 
objected. 

“No more often than the past 
surveys were. I generally split 
up what I want to know into 
about ten elements, get ten an- 
swers, none of which is individu- 
ally trustworthy, integrate them 
so that the variations cancel each 
other — ” 

“And guess,” said Babs, in sat- 
isfaction. “I knew it would come 
to that in the end.” 

T\AVE and Corvey grinned at 
each other — Corvey helpless- 
ly, Dave fondly. To Dave, every- 
thing Babs did was wonderful. If 
she made a remark, it was bound 
to be a good one because she 
made it. If anybody beat her 
at anything, the anybody must 
be pretty good. 

Yet Dave, in things which did- 
n’t concern Babs, was very shrewd 
indeed. 

“And then,” he said, “in addi- 
tion, there’s your other job.” 

“Other job?” Corvey echoed. 

“Your real job. We know you, 



Ken. Think we don’t know you’re 
a spy?” 

They were looking at him with- 
out hostility, merely amused that 
he should have thought they did- 
n’t know. 

“Why, do I look like a spy?” 
Corvey asked reasonably, trying 
by sheer will power to keep his 
breathing steady and his pulse 
rate slow, trying to act as^if it 
really were a fantastic idea. 

“You wouldn’t be much good 
as a spy if you did,” Babs ob- 
served; then she and Dave burst 
out laughing. “Who’s your beau- 
tiful accomplice?” 

He didn’t have a beautiful ac- 
complice, but Sandra Reid was 
beautiful, all right. It would be 
nice to have her as an accomplice. 
She was that amazing phenome- 
non, an intelligent girl who acted 
like a tart, a tart who acted like 
a nice girl, a nice girl who looked 
like a particularly seductive 
movie star, all in one. 

He looked down at her as 
she lay with her eyes closed, un- 
aware of his presence. He would 
have liked, very much, to spend 
a long time studying Sandra 
Reid. 

But there was a time and place 
for everything, except Sandra. 
There was no time, no place for 
Sandra and himself. Or, if there 
ever should be, this certainly was- 
n’t it. 



123 



He mustn’t have anything to do 
with Sandra. 

As he was on the point of going 
away — really going away — she 
opened her eyes. And he missed 
something. 

“ . ill?” Dave asked. 

Corvey searched his mind but 
failed to find the rest of the 
sentence. That rarely happened. 

Dave was waiting. Corvey 
couldn’t answer the ques- 
tion, couldn’t refuse to answer it, 
couldn’t ignore it and didn’t see 
how he could ask for a repetition. 

He checked rapidly. Was this 
real? 

Of course it was real. And Dave 
was waiting. 

“Sorry, Dave,” said Corvey. 
“Just remembered something I 
should have done this afternoon 
and didn’t. What were you say- 
ing?” 

“I said, is that why you’re 
reluctant to take a few days off, 
even when you’re ill?” 

That didn’t help much. “Is 
what why?” Corvey had to ask. 

“The fact that there are so few 
survey reporters, and nobody can 
finish another man’s job.” 

that,” said Corvey, re- 
lieved. He didn’t mind talk- 
ing about his job. He was so glad 
the conversation he had missed 
had been on such a harmless sub- 
ject that he said something com- 



pletely unnecessary. “I told you 
a little about my job the other 
day, didn’t I?” 

“The other day?” 

“At the Country Club.” 

Dave stared at him. “We 
haven’t been at the Country Club 
for weeks.” 

“Oh, it must have been some- 
one else,” said Corvey easily, 
though he was sweating. The 
Country Club episode must have 
been a false memory. It had 
never happened. He might have 
known that from the way it col- 
lapsed and dissolved at the end — 
but he hadn’t had time to ex- 
amine it yet. 

“You really are sick, Ken,” 
Dave said, concerned. 

Corvey shook his head. “Ab- 
sent-mindedness is a sort of oc- 
cupational disease among survey 
reporters,” he said. “I’m working 
on a lot of tricky problems just 
now, too. And I’m tired — heav- 
ens, how tired I am.” 

“Leave Ken alone, Dave,” said 
Babs sympathetically. “He’s just- 
sleepy. Come on, let’s take him 
home and put him to bed.” 
Though Corvey protested, 
they did just that. Twice, before 
they left him, he checked des- 
perately, sure that this couldn’t 
really be happening. But" it was. 

Corvey’s father had once told 
him, “Judge your friends by 
what they’ll do for you, son.” On 
that basis, Babs and Dave were 



124

his best friends — and not merely 
on Earth. 

Alone at last, safe, comfortable 
in bed, in the dark, he longed for 
sleep. But he had some thinking 
to do first. 

Tonight had been the worst so 
far. If Dave and Babs had known 
anything about ritany, they’d 
have seen he was suffering from 
it and was therefore a non-Ter- 
restrial. 

Fortunately, no one outside 
the Jernam system — and that 
was ninety-seven light years 
away — knew much about ritany, 
which was a fever peculiar to 
Aram, the fifth planet. As far as 
Corvey knew, no one had ever 
had an attack outside Aram. 
When he had been sent to Earth, 
perhaps it had been assumed 
that, because it hadn’t happened, 
it never would happen. 

Corvey was a hospital case, yet 
he couldn’t risk hospitalization. 
If he did, for a few hours or days 
the doctors would be puzzled — 
but eventually they would test 
for extra terrestrial diseases and 
diagnose ritany. True, that 
wouldn’t be a hanging matter. If 
his Aramin origin were on rec- 
ord, it would be no offense at all 
to have ritany. But for Kenneth 
Corvey, survey reporter on the 
Rutledge Star with a manufac- 
tured history going back through 
31 years to a counterfeited birth 
in New York, to turn out to be a 



native of the planet Aram . 

He would obviously be a spy. 
And they still shot spies, he be- 
lieved. Spies had to be discour- 
aged, somehow. There was no 
guarantee they would shoot him 
—much, much less that they 
would not. 

There were no arrangements to 
get him home to Aram until his 
job would be over, successfully 
or unsuccessfully, in three weeks. 
Could he last three weeks? 

He could go away somewhere 
and live quietly until the time 
came for him to leave Earth. By 
so doing, he would save his life, 
at the expense of the job he had 
been sent to do. Or he could stay 
where he was and probably fail 
in his job as well as lose his life. 
But as long as there was a chance 
of success, he had to stay. 

\V/HAT were the chances? On 
” the basis of this night’s at- 
tack, no good. Spies always had 
to tread carefully in case some 
tiny, unsuspected difference be- 
trayed them. 

Corvey had another handicap 
to add to the crushing total. He 
was in the grip of a fever which 
weakened his limbs and thus di- 
minished his control over them, 
which made his head ache con- 
tinuously, causing him to shiver 
uncontrollably sometimes — and 
' which gave him sporadic delu- 
sions. 



SPY 



125 



It was a physical, not a mental 
illness. The hallucinations that 
accompanied it were not mark- 
edly psychotic. This made them 
all the more difficult to identify. 
They were not simply wish-ful- 
fillments, or memories, or fears, 
or warnings, or guilt feelings, or 
any of the other things which 
formed the material of ordinary 
dreams. 

Generally they were extrapola- 
tions of what was actually hap- 
pening — there was nothing 
whatever to show that they were 
delusions. Corvey might easily 
have been at the Country Club 
with Dave and Babs. Only Dave’s 
saying that Corvey was a spy was 
bizarre, like something in an anx- 
iety dream. On the other N hand, 
when Dave and Babs put him to 
bed, it was hard to believe it was 
really happening, was not part 
of some crazy scene his fevered 
mind was putting him through. 

O NE of the worst things about 
ritany was that memories 
were memories, and it was dif- 
ficult to judge whether a recollec- 
tion was a memory of an event 
or of a ritanic delusion. When he 
mentioned the incident at the 
Country Club, Corvey had been 
aware of no risk. He hadn’t 
checked mentally over the whole 
incident to make sure it had all 
happened. He had merely remem- 
bered talking to Dave and Babs 



about his job at the Country Club. 

What he did when he was in 
the middle of a delusion, he had 
no way of knowing. From other 
cases, back on Aram, he knew 
that a victim of ritany would of- 
ten act normally, convincingly 
and for long periods, from sheer 
habit. On a world where ritany 
was familiar, of course, it was 
easily identified and cured. On 
Earth . ? 

The cure was simply a month 
in bed. The hallucinations of rit- 
any, not being psychosomatic in 
origin, were harmless and, pro- 
vided the patient stayed flat on 
his back, the fever died, the delu- 
sions faded and, ultimately, noth-, 
ing remained except memories of 
some very vivid dreams, neither 
pleasant nor unpleasant as a rule. 
Only psychotics had violently 
disturbing hallucinations. 

However, Corvey couldn’t go 
to bed. If he did, a doctor would 
visit him almost automatically. 
He’d then have to pretend to be 
normal, which would not only 
place him in danger of discovery, 
but would also prevent the fever 
from breaking. 

He wasn’t a weak character — 
interstellar spies could hardly be 
weak. But sometimes the danger, 
the fever, the difficulty of his job, 
the unattainability of the one 
thing he really wanted — to stay 
in bed and rest — piled up and be- 
came too much for him. At such 



126 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



times he wanted, actually want- 
ed, to be discovered. He wanted it 
to be over and done with. 

II 

TN the morning he felt terrible, 
but at least there was very lit- 
tle risk of further delusions. In 
the morning, his headache was 
at its worst, his fever only mod- 
erate. He could do a good morn- 
ing’s work before ritany took 
hold of him again. 

Just before he left the office 
for lunch, Jim Neave, the feature 
editor and, to all intents and pur- 
poses, his boss, sent for him. Cor- 
vey was on the day shift, since 
much of his business was with 
people in their normal pursuits. 

Neave was about fifty, a hear- 
ty, apparently superficial char- 
acter. Corvey knew his boss’s 
manner was merely the building 
in which he worked and had 
ceased to pay much attention to 
Neave’s eccentricities. He knew 
that, when Neave praised any- 
body expansively, or seemed to 
delight in his own cleverness, or 
talked at length about something 
not very important, no conclu- 
sion could be drawn except that 
Neave had something on his mind 
and found it necessary to throw 
a veil over it. 

He was a good man to work 
for, though. He seemed to know 
everyone’s capacities, he always 



asked for just a little less than 
he was going to get, always gave 
credit for anything-over demand. 

“Look, Ken,” said Neave, 
“you’re working too hard.” 

“Maybe a little,” Corvey ad- 
mitted cautiously. 

“Why?” 

“It’s the nature of my job,” he 
said. “It has to happen some- 
times. Somebody else could hire 
an assistant, but an assistant 
wouldn’t be any good to me. No 
one can follow through on any 
survey reporter’s line of investi- 
gation except himself. It’s like a 
train of thought. Someone else 
can think, may even reach the 
same conclusion, but he can’t 
reach it the same way. I will ad- 
mit I’m pretty tired.” 

Neave nodded. “Let’s see,” he 
said, looking through a black 
notebook. “We’ll need your story 
on settlement recruitment . .” 
“Nearly ready.” 

“And the survey on compara- 
tive intelligence in America and 
Europe — how’s it coming? We 
need an answer to that London 
professor.” 

“I’ll have it by Saturday.” 
“After that, there’s nothing vi- 
tal until you start the big series 
on the defense tests. No, I’m not 
going to brief you on that yet. 
Tell you what, Ken. If you put in 
for a week starting Saturday, I’ll 
see you get it.” 

“Thanks, Jim. I’ll do that. I

know I could do with a rest.” 

Corvey was pleased, and didn’t 
try to conceal it. A week of con- 
valescing wouldn’t finish the rit- 
any, but it might enable him to 
carry on. 

npHE welfare state idea had 
spread around the world. Peo- 
ple had a lot of freedom, cer- 
tainly. But the root idea of the 
welfare state was security — and 
security meant certain restric- 
tions. Some things had to be au- 
tomatic, and the health service 
was one of them. Anyone who 
was absent from work two days 
was visited by a doctor. 

Corvey could take a week’s 
holiday if it were offered. If it 
weren’t, asking for it might lead 
to a medical check-up he couldn’t 
refuse. Staying off work for two 
days would have the same result. 

Things had worked out better 
than he could have hoped, for he 
hadn’t been with the Star long 
enough to rate any vacation. 

He lunched alone after seeing 
Neave. Leaving the restaurant, 
he almost ran into Sandra’s arms 
— a good place to be, though he 
had hitherto refused to acknowl- 
edge his awareness of the fact. 

“You’re looking very pleased 
with yourself,” she said. “Won a 
bet?” 

Corvey told her about the 
week’s holiday. 

“That’s great,” said Sandra. 



'“Let’s go have a drink to cele- 
brate.” 

Sandra was popular with ev- 
ery' male of her acquaintance, 
young or old, and disliked by al- 
most every woman. Babs hated 
her. 

They went to a cocktail bar, 
all mirrors, a really delightful lit- 
tle place. Sandra, sitting on a 
high stool and toasting him, was 
exquisite. She was a dark blonde 
who had resisted the temptation 
to become a golden blonde. She 
carried not an ounce too much 
flesh and not an ounce too little. 
She had the great gift, a rare 
quality, of taking charge with- 
out seeming to, so that the man 
she was with thought himself 
very enterprising, indeed. 

“Where are you going?” she 
asked. 

He shrugged. “South some- 
where — Florida, I guess.” 

“Now it just so happens,” said 
Sandra, “that I was thinking of 
taking a week in Miami, myself.” 

“Fine,” declared Corvey, the 
whisky he had just downed kill- 
ing both the fever and his head- 
ache and making him feel 
wonderful. “We’ll fly down to- 
gether.” 

Presently he found himself 
kissing Sandra. It was very nice, 
as he had known it would be. It 
was twice as nice as he had ex- 
pected. 

They agreed to meet on the 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Saturday afternoon plane and 
had another drink or two to 
pledge it. 

TT was in the middle of a series 
of calculations in the after- 
noon that Corvey became aware 
that it had really happened. 

He had had an attack of ritany 
once before, on Aram. Usually it 
happened only once, like measles, 
but occasionally people had a 
second or even a third attack be- 
fore the particular bug which 
caused it became harmless. 

During his previous attack — 
under the right conditions, of 
course — he had learned how to 
treat it. Now he had to fight the 
delusions and couldn’t help wor- 
rying, for fear of revealing his 
true identity. 

He had allowed the incident 
with Sandra to go as it liked, 
there being no apparent immedi- 
ate danger. He hadn’t even tried 
to settle the question of whether 
it was really happening or not, 
had taken for granted that it 
wasn’t. It had the airiness, the 
casualness, the lack of detail that 
was typical of a ritanic halluci- 
nation. Only in such a delusion 
would he go out to a bar with a 
girl he hardly knew, tell her he 
was going to Florida, kiss her and 
agree to meet her on the plane. 
That was the stuff of which 
dreams were made. 

But, on reflection, he was cer- 



tain that it had actually hap- 
pened. 

He could be quite rational and 
he could always distinguish be- 
tween true and false, when he 
really thought about it. 

Going away with Sandra was 
quite out of the question. He had 
to find the easiest way out. Sim- 
ply not meet Sandra? No, that 
wouldn’t do. Tell her he had 
changed his mind? Yes, if he 
could find a good reason. Go 
where she wouldn’t go? 

Once more he was brought face 
to face with the irony of being a 
spy. Nothing would suit him bet- 
ter than a vacation with Sandra. 
If he weren’t a spy, nothing 
would be easier than to cut loose 
from her. If he weren’t a spy, she 
probably wouldn’t have become 
sufficiently intrigued to want to 
join him. If he weren’t a spy . 

TTE was in Jan Ryter’s office, 
on Aram. Vaguely, this time 
he knew it was a delusion. But 
he let it run on, as a man who 
knows he must get up soon al- 
lows himself to drowse just a few 
minutes more — for Ken felt 
it was grand to be home for a 
while. Having made that deci- 
sion, he promptly lived the scene. 
That was the way of ritany, 

“I could be sociable, Corvey,” 
Ryter was saying coldly, “but 
this is an unsentimental business, 
and I think we’d both prefer to

save our sentiment for off-duty 
hours. Right?” 

Corvey nodded. 

“Well, what have you accom- 
plished, Corvey? If it’s nothing, 
say so.” 

“It’s more than nothing. Plant- 
ing me as a survey reporter has 
been successful in that I’ve been 
detailed to do a whole series of 
surveys on the defense tests. I 
haven’t been able to find out what 
information will be available to 
me when the tests start and what 
will be denied. But if I’m expect- 
ed to produce any significant re- 
sults, I have reasonable grounds 
for demanding just about every- 
thing.” 

“Is your position in any way 
official?” 

“No, I’m merely a newspaper 
representative, and all my mate- 
rial will be screened before publi- 
cation. But I’ll have to know 
much more than I use, of course.” 
“Have you any ideas on what 
your conclusions will be?” 

“I think,” said Corvey care- 
fully, “I’ll find that Earth’s de- 
fenses are remarkably good, that 
they will suggest offensive weap- 
ons which would make the result 
of any war against us a foregone 
conclusion — and that there will 
be no particular suggestion of an- 
imosity or prospective conflict 
against anybody, ourselves no 
more than the other colonies.” 
Ryter nodded. “I must thank 



you for a decided, clear and frank 
statement.” 

A BRUPTLY Corvey was star- 
ing at a column of figures 
which didn’t make sense — no 
longer on Aram, but in Rutledge, 
U.S.A., Earth. He must have 
done quite a bit of calculation 
unconsciously — slowly but cor- 
rectly — on the colonial settlement 
program. 

It was astonishing that he 
could have failed to notice it be- 
fore — it was obvious, now, that 
the colonists were a highly se- 
lected group. All colonists, in any 
colony. 

Earth had over four billion in- 
habitants, but the world wasn’t 
really overcrowded. Not with ef- 
ficient agricultural methods and 
half a dozen hydroponics plants 
in every state. It was natural for 
a young man, or a young family, 
to stay put. 

Only a particular type — rather, 
several particular types — would 
leave Earth. 

This obvious fact, which he had 
not previously seen, ruined sev- 
eral hours’ work. 

Jim Neave came into Corvey’s 
little office while he was still 
considering the matter. Corvey 
pointed it out to him. 

Neave frowned. “I’m no survey 
man, Ken, but that’s the first 
thing I’d have thought of. Only 
someone who was a colonist him- 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



self would be likely to miss that 
angle.” 

Corvey had been trained long 
ago not to show any sign of 
shock in such circumstance^. He 
merely said, “That’s so. I sup- 
pose I was working from the co- 
lonial viewpoint,” and talked of 
something else — his week in 
Florida. 

It was another instance of the 
kind of thing which could hap- 
pen to a spy at any moment. 
Sooner or later someone, unlike 
Babs and Dave, unlike Jim 
Neave, would be suspicious. And 
whoever was suspicious would 
follow up whatever it was that 
had aroused his suspicions. The 
U.S. counter-espionage service 
would get on the job, and pass it 
on to AS. 

AS was U.N.’s counter-espion- 
age organization, and Corvey was 
quite frankly afraid of it. If AS 
got a strong enough clue to jus- 
tify real suspicion, he would be 
either definitely convicted or def- 
initely cleared. 

AS was so good that nobody 
knew much about it. Ryter hadn’t 
been able to tell Corvey anything 
except that the only way to deal 
with AS was to keep clear of it. 
AS was a bogey man for every 
extraterrestrial operative. The 
only thing that was known about 
it for certain was that it was a 
rare event for anyone to find out 
anything about whatever AS was 



supposed to be guarding. 

And AS was certain to be 
guarding the Rutledge defense 
tests. 

This was why Corvey had to 
be very careful about Sandra. So 
far, no one had anything that 
could be turned into proof against 
him. Sandra very soon would, if 
he had anything more to do with 
her. 

As it was, there was no ques- 
tion of his going away with her. 

It was important, too, that he 
should shake Sandra off without 
giving her any hint of why he 
invariably refused the chances 
she offered. 

TTE knew where she worked. 

Instead of being a model, as 
she might well have been, she was 
a highly paid advertising copy- 
writer, which meant that she had 
brains. Stupid people weren’t paid 
Sandra’s salary. 

He was at the agency door 
when she came out. He fell into 
step beside her and took her arm. 
“Let’s go and have another drink, 
Sandra,” he said. 

“But . 

“I think we ought to talk this 
Florida business over.” 

“Okay,” said Sandra brightly. 

Corvey made quite sure, this 
time, that the incident was no 
delusion. He concentrated on the 
ache in his head. That usually 
kept him anchored to reality.

They went to the same cocktail 
bar, which was another anchor. 

“Look, Sandra,” said Corvey, 
with a grin. “It won’t do.” 

Sandra didn’t pretend to mis- 
understand. 

“Going to Florida together, you 
mean? You’ve no right to say 
that. I haven’t suggested any- 
thing . .” 

“You don’t need to suggest 
anything. I know what’s going to 
happen.” 

“Then you know more than I 
do.” 

“If I’m right, I don’t want you 
to come. If I’m wrong, there’s no 
particular point in your coming.” 
“You look,” said Sandra. “You 
said you were spending a week 
in Florida.- 1 said I was going to 
Miami for a week. That’s all.” 
“Seriously, Sandra, I’m going 
for a rest. Now I ask you . 

He left the sentence hanging. 

Sandra laughed, taking it as a 
compliment. 

“Believe me, I can be a relax- 
ing companion, too.” 

Corvey shook his head. “With 
you around, how could I rest?” • 
“What you really mean, then, 
is that you just don’t want me to 
be with you — isn’t it?” 

“Yes.” 

“All right. I can take a hint, 
eventually. Good luck, Ken.” 
“Good-by, Sandra.” 

“I never say good-by to any- 
body.” 



/'^ORVEY got away all right 
^ and checked in, late Satur- 
day afternoon, at a quiet Miami 
hotel. No loss of appetite accom- 
panied ritany — fresh air, good 
food, sunlight and rest were the 
things needed to combat it. At 
the hotel he selected, he could 
have them all. 

He lazed all of Sunday and 
Monday. There were hallucina- 
tions galore, but they didn’t mat- 
ter. He spent most of the daylight 
hours on a veranda, half dozing, 
and neither the hotel staff nor the 
other guests disturbed him. He 
could answer any question sleep- 
ily and absently or not at all, and 
nobody was in the least suspi- 
cious. 

He was seldom aware of his 
headache. Only on the three or 
four occasions during the day 
when he moved from his couch 
did he have to cope with the 
weakness in his limbs. He didn’t 
have to move for meals — they 
were brought to him where he 
was. He had let it be understood 
that he was convalescing after an 
illness. 

There were some very pleasant 
delusions, some indifferent ones, 
some which were unpleasant. 
They tended to be more pleasant 
when the victim wasn’t fighting 
them — fighting them produced 
more anxiety hallucinations.

Once he found himself back on 
Aram, on the river with Janet, 
his first girl. 

On another occasion, he took 
a fanciful trip to Venus — very 
fanciful, since he had never been 
to Venus. 

In one episode — thoroughly 
unpleasant — he had murdered 
Babs rather nastily and was help- 
ing a grim, vengeful Dave in an 
effort to discover the murderer. 
Dave always seemed just on the 
point of discovering the truth, 
and Corvey died a thousand 
deaths in his efforts to keep him 
off the right track. 

The frequency and violence of 
the delusions, now that he was 
merely resting, showed the sever- 
ity of Corvey’s case. It might 
have been mild enough, properly 
treated, but Corvey had been do- 
ing the worst thing possible for 
the past month, preventing the 
fever from lifting. Ritany wasn’t 
an illness that could be fought. 
The way to recover from it was 
to give in to it. 

In another delusion, he wasn’t 
a spy. He had been born on 
Earth and knew next to nothing 
about Aram. 

That fantasy was very pleas- 
ant indeed. It was nice not to be 
a S py — to be an ordinary Earth- 
man doing a job he liked. 

But some of the conclusions to 
be drawn from this one were up- 
set by the fact that other hallu- 



cinations, in which he was an 
ordinary Aramin living on Aram, 
were equally pleasant. 

O N Tuesday evening Sandra 
turned up. 

He had just re-oriented him- 
self as Ken Corvey, survey re- 
porter on the Rutledge Star, on 
vacation in Miami. Sandra 
strolled onto the veranda, wear- 
ing a sunsuit which indicated she 
must have been living close by. 
Her outfit was hardly street wear, 
even in Miami. 

“I though you’d turn up soon- 
er or later,” he said. 

She shook her head. “You had 
no reason to count on it, Ken. 
If a man plays hard to get long 
enough, he’s liable to find him- 
self with no takers.” 

“I’m not playing hard to get,” 
said Corvey quietly. 

She frowned. “You’re married 
or something?” 

“Something. Sit down and I’ll 
tell you about it.” 

She dropped onto a pneumatic 
couch and lounged decor atively, 
waiting. Part of Sandra’s appeal 
was her eagerness, her interest in 
what you had to say. No bored 
glamour girl, Sandra — she lis- 
tened with gratifying attention, 
fell in with any suggestion that 
was made, enjoyed any enter- 
tainment that was offered. 

“There are some jobs, you 
know,” Corvey said, “that are 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



more important than one’s pri- 
vate life.” 

Sandra shook her head decid- 
edly. “I don’t believe it.” 

“You mean you wouldn’t do 
such a job?” 

She nodded. “Yes, I suppose 
that is what I mean. Are you tell- 
ing me your job is one of them?” 
“Yes.” 

“Your job on the Star?” 

“No — another job.” 

“An undercover job?” 

“Yes.” 

“Why tell me now, if not be- 
fore?” *- 

“Because now I think I can 
trust you.” 

Sandra’s gaze locked frankly 
with his. “I like to be trusted,” 
she admitted. “Go on.” 

“Have you ever left Earth?” 
Corvey asked. 

“I’ve been on the Moon, that’s 
all. Why?” 

“Do you know much about the 
colonies?” 

“You mean the deep-space 
worlds — Vokis, Ritchel, Watton 
and the rest? Not very much.” 
“How do you feel about these 
colonies, about which you don’t 
know very much?” 

“I thought you were going to 
tell me something, not ask ques- 
tions.” 

“How do you feel about them?” 
Corvey insisted. 

“I don’t know. I don’t know 
that I feel about them at all. I’d 



like to go there, of course — to all 
the worlds if I could. Seeing 
them, I might start to have feel- 
ings about them. Meanwhile — no. 
I’ve never been to New Zealand, 
either, and T'haven’t any feelings 
about New Zealand. It’s a place 
I’ve seen pictures of, that’s all.” 
“You don’t feel any animosity 
toward Vokis, Ritchel and Wat- 
ton?” 

“Why should I?” 

“Some people do — because 
they’re not familiar places.” 
Sandra shrugged her shoulders. 
“There’s no idea so silly nobody 
believes it — no prejudice, no dis- 
like.” 

“Do you think you could even 
see the point of view of Vokis, 
Ritchel or Watton, when Earth 
had a different slant?” 

S ANDRA suddenly became 
more cautious. “I might — but 
probably not. Are you telling me 
you’ve some sort of scheme 
against Earth?” 

“Not against Earth — not re- 
ally.” 

“You’re working for one of 
these worlds, anyway — and it 
may be against Earth?” 

“Yes. What’s your reaction to 
that?” 

Sandra looked serious. “Even 
if I saw your point of view, Ken, 
I couldn’t help you. Couldn’t do 
anything but hinder you, in fact.” 
“Why?” 



SPY 



135 



“Because being a traitor is a 
terrible thing.” 

“I don’t quite follow that.” 
“Traitors aren’t nice people, 
even -when they sincerely believe 
the country they help against 
their own is right. They’re work- 
ing against the country whose 
protection they’re accepting. 
That, to me, is the vile thing 
about it. Spies aren’t so bad.” 

“So what are you going to do?” 
Corvey asked. 

He hadn’t been looking at her, 
for it was much easier to carry 
on a reasonable discussion if he 
didn’t. Now he turned and looked 
her straight in the face. 

“I think,” she said slowly, “I 
shall have to try and stop you.” 
“Even though I’ve told you 
this of my own free will, in con- 
fidence?” 

She shook her head reluctantly. 
“You can’t ask me to be a trai- 
tor, Ken. If this is a joke, it’s a 
crazy one. If it isn’t, I have to 
report what you’ve said, even 
though . .” 

“Even though what?” 

“Well, you don’t think it’ll be 
easy for me, do you? I don’t mean 
I’m going to turn you in. It 
would be better if you went away 
— and then, while you were away, 
I could tell the police what 
you’ve told me.” 

“If that’s the best you can of- 
fer,” Corvey said quietly, “I’m 
afraid I’ll have to make better 



' terms than you’re offering me.” 
Before she could move, his 
shoe had sunk deep in her dia- 
phragm. She never recovered 
from the paroxysm, for he drop- 
ped beside her and neatly, effi- 
ciently, broke her neck. 

H E got that far, but the emo- 
tional shock snapped him 
right out of the delusion. 

It had been quite real, for in 
most of the hallucinations he was 
unaware of the very existence of 
ritany. Only when he attacked 
Sandra had there been any un- 
real quality. 

, Still sweating, recovering from 
the shock, he considered the in- 
cident. 

It probably wasn’t far from 
what would actually happen if he 
spoke to Sandra like that. The 
delusions didn’t need any ele- 
ment of truth about them, and 
prophetic delusions might be 
wholly untrustworthy. But gen- 
erally, predictions were as correct 
as his own knowledge, and he saw 
no reason to distrust the warning 
’ in this incident. 

The warning was — not to 
change his mind about Sandra. 

There had been some danger of 
it — considerable danger — that he 
might have confided in her. And 
it was unlikely that she would 
ever support him against her own 
world. 

But he had no time to ration- 



136 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




SPY 



137 



alize it any more, for he was in 
the middle of another delusion 
and he didn’t know it was a de- 
lusion. 

He was leaning on the rail of a 
yacht, a cool breeze on his face. 
It was night, and there were so 
many stars that the Moon was 
hardly missed. He knew, this 
time, that he had been born on 
Aram, and that this was Earth. 

Over his shoulder came a fa- 
miliar compound scent — crushed 
petals and mild pipe tobacco. He 
put one arm around Dave, the 
other around Babs and turned 
back to the rail. 

“You haven’t anything like 
this on Aram,” said Babs chal- 
lengingly. 

He refused to argue. “I was 
just thinking that,” he said. 
“When a Terran goes to Aram, he 
thinks it’s beautiful. And so it is 
— with its greens and purples and 
browns, warm and hazy and 
fairylike. But the next day, the 
next month, the next year, Aram 
is just the same — while Earth has 
always something new to show 
you, something different.” 

“Every time we talk about 
Earth and Aram,” said Dave in 
that slow, thoughtful way of his, 
“you seem to prefer Earth. Have 
you become a naturalized Ter- 
ran, Ken?” 

Corvey didn’t answer for quite 
a while. His arms were still in 
close, companionable contact 



with Babs and Dave — who would 
always, to him, represent Earth. 
Dave was solid, slow, sympa- 
thetic. If one thought in symbols, 
Dave would be the stolid but 
shrewd peasant who was still the 
backbone of Earth’s humanity. 
Babs was impulsive, always in a 
hurry, yet just as ready to help 
as her husband. She symbolized 
the pushing, frenetic life of the 
great cities, something not very 
familiar to the colonies. 

“I think,” he said at last, “that 
intellectually I prefer Earth all 
the way, but emotionally I’m 
still an Aramin.” 

Babs squeezed his arm affec- 
tionately. “That’s a good an- 
swer,” she said warmly. “I hate 
people who get too big for their 
own people.” 

IV 

W EDNESDAY, Thursday 
and Friday passed easily 
and pleasantly. The hallucina- 
tions became thinner — quite oft- 
en Corvey would dream a vivid 
dream, but know it was a dream. 

Saturday wasn’t so good, for 
he was due to return the next day 
to finish an article for Monday’s 
paper. He had to face two things. 
The first was that the ritany 
wasn’t gone, that once he went 
back to fighting it, he might have 
more trouble with it. The second 
was that, when he got back to 



138 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Rutledge, he would again be an 
Aramin agent, working against 
Earth. 

He had tried to justify himself 
to Sandra in his delusion. He was 
working not against Earth, but 
for his own world. 

It was a distinction without a 
difference. > 

A spy had no control over the 
use to which the information he 
stole was put. He was a thief, no 
less, a thief of valuable informa- 
tion. He took it back and gave it 
to his employers. It might be 
used purely defensively, which 
was legitimate. It would do Earth 
no harm for Aram to know and 
copy Earth’s defensive setup. 

But defense often led to of- 
fense, information about safe- 
guards enabled more deadly 
weapons to be made, more dead- 
ly weapons sometimes led to a 
test, and the test was sometimes 
called war. 

Corvey knew very well that, in 
the end, he would do what he 
had been sent to do. But that 
didn’t enable him to stop think- 
ing about it with misgivings. 

He had become a spy because 
of false ideas about the job — 
ideas which he soon found to be 
false. When he did, he didn’t give 
up the job, any more than stage- 
struck girls, when they found the 
theater wasn’t quite what they 
thought it was, or writers, when 
they found their first book wasn’t 



a best-seller, or violinists, when 
they found they weren’t destined 
to be concert soloists. Like them 
he plodded on, his illusions gone, 
or almost gone, doing a job which 
still retained just a thread of the 
glamor it had had for him. 

He went on being an agent 
from Aram because he couldn’t 
see himself being anything else. 

SATURDAY evening, Sandra 
^ really did appear. 

When he saw her, he was in the 
grip of no hallucination. But he 
checked with himself again and 
again before he believed in her 
reality. He pinched himself, he 
scanned rapidly back over the 
day, he oriented himself — and by 
the time' Sandra was within 
speaking range, he knew she was 
really there. 

In addition to the pleasure of 
seeing her and the knowledge that 
he must mean a lot to her to 
cause her to chase him so shame- 
lessly, there was a certain cool 
curiosity about how this real 
meeting would compare with the 
imaginary one. In one respect it 
was certainly going to be differ- 
ent — he wasn’t going to tell her 
he was a spy. 

She strolled onto the veranda, 
in the same way, and in a similar 
costume. But Corvey didn’t make 
the same brash opening. This 
time he waited for Sandra. 

“I came to bring you back,”

she said with a smile and dropped 
on the pneumatic couch, precise- 
ly as she had in the delusion. 
“Tonight?” he exclaimed. 

“No, tomorrow.” 

“Then why come tonight?” . 
She shrugged and smiled again, 
but said nothing. 

“I don’t get it,” he said. “I 
used to think you went for me 
only because I wouldn’t go for 
you. But it can’t be just that.” 

“I don’t know either,” Sandra 
admitted. “I should have given 
you up completely, long ago, and 
I don’t know why I haven’t. 
Partly, it’s because I’m pretty 
sure you’re not as indifferent to 
me as you pretend.” 

“There’s no secret about that,” 
said Corvey. “How could I be?” 
Sandra frowned. “You’re not 
married or something?” she asked 
— exactly as in the hallucination. 

He shook his head. “Let’s say, 
instead, I’m sick.” 

She looked up quickly. “Sick 
— is that it? You mean there’s 
something permanently wrong 
with you?” 

“In a way, yes.” Having been 
born on Aram was the same as 
having something permanently 
wrong with him as far as Sandra 
was concerned. 

“So sick that you’ve decided 
never to get married?” 

“That’s so.” 

“Who said anything about 
marriage?” 



She held her arms out to him. 
That he was able to resist such a 
temptation was a great surprise 
to Corvey. His opinion of himself 
went up — for resist it he did. 

Sandra sighed and dropped her 
arms. “Oh, well,” she said. “I 
don’t often talk about myself — 
it’s the only thing I’m shy about.” 
She picked at the cushion un- 
der her, looking down her arm at 
her long fingers. “I don’t know 
what’s wrong with you, Ken,” she 
said, “but there’s certainly some- 
thing wrong with me. I should 
never have been born. Having 
been born, I shouldn’t have lived 
— a hundred years ago, I 
wouldn’t have. Fifty years ago, 
I’d have died while still a child. 
Even as it was, they just barely 
kept me alive, but life was about 
all they could give me.” 

C ORVEY stared at her incred- 
ulously. She was lean and 
clear-skinned, not only a beauti- 
ful girl but a perfect female phys- 
ical specimen. There wasn’t a 
flaw anywhere. 

“No,” she admitted, sensing his 
gaze, “there isn’t much wrong 
with me now. Given time, doctors 
can work miracles. They don’t 
even need a strong constitution to 
help them — they give you the 
strong constitution first, then 
build on it. But that takes a long 
time. 

“I never was a child, in the 



140

normal sense. From the moment 
I was born, I was a patient. I 
didn’t walk until I was seven. I 
was thirteen before I could run. 
Not until I was sixteen — seven 
years ago — could you say I had 
normal health.” 

TTE had to check again to make 
sure Sandra was really 
telling him this. He had never re- 
motely suspected such a back- 
ground in Sandra’s life — though, 
now that he knew about it, it 
made sense. 

“I was trained,” Sandra went 
on quietly, “from the first mo- 
ment I could see, hear and think, 
that my body meant pain. Or if 
not pain, a constant, nagging dis- 
comfort. I never felt really well 
until I was eleven, and for five 
years that was intermittent. 

“I’m not complaining. I’m the 
luckiest girl alive that now I’m 
strong, healthy and pretty. I’m 
as happy as any girl I know, and 
with more reason. I’m just tell- 
ing you about the contrast, the 
change in me. While I was an 
invalid, I had a good education 
— but the thing I was surest of, 
from my own experience, was 
that my body could never, never 
give me any pleasure. 

“Maybe now you can under- 
stand me better. At sixteen I 
learned to swim. I was so de- 
lighted I’d have swum all day if 
there hadn’t been walking, too. 



Can you imagine how glorious it 
is to walk for miles and miles 
and never get tired, remembering 
when you had to stop and rest 
half a dozen times going around 
the block? Running was even 
better. When you’re a perfect 
running machine, sprinting is 
sheer ecstasy — particularly if you 
have vivid recollections of how 
once all you could do was totter 
along, lungs laboring and a pain 
in your side. 

“There were thousands of 
things, either things I’d never 
been able to do before or things 
I’d done painfully, at low effi- 
ciency, with no pleasure at all. 
Dancing — they had to stop me 
doing that for a while, I got so 
excited about it. 

“And men — almost at once, 
kissing, cuddling and affection. 
My body had been a heavy lia- 
bility for sixteen years. Now it 
suddenly and wonderfully be- 
came a glorious asset.” 

She met his gaze defiantly for 
a moment, then looked down 
again and went on more quietly. 
“When I’m a little older, I’ll be- 
come better balanced. I’ve known 
the mental pleasures and the 
physical pleasures and, in a few 
years, I’ll strike a balance be- 
tween them. Meanwhile, the 
physical pleasures are still too 
new for me to have much time 
for anything else. Do you under- 
stand?”

H E didn’t answer, somehow 
aware she still had some- 
thing to say. Presently she said it. 

“One other thing — I told you 
I should never have been born. 
That was my parents’ fault. I 
never knew either of them and 
perhaps it’s as well. I hate them. 
They’re the only people I ever 
learned to hate and it took a long 
time — years of pain. 

“There aren’t many people left 
whose heredity is weak enough 
to produce the creature I was. 
They should never have married, 
especially each other. And if they 
did, it was a crime to have chil- 
dren. Understand what I mean 
when I say I’ll never get mar- 
ried?” 

“There’s no reason . .” Corvey 
began. 

“I know what you’re going to 
say. Quite a lot of people get 
married although they can’t have 
children, but I certainly never 
shall. Though I might, if I knew 
the man concerned wasn’t keen 
on having children either. But 
I’d think more than twice before 
I did.” 

Corvey nodded. “I understand. 
Thanks for telling me this, San- 
dra.” 

He considered confiding in her, 
as she had confided in him. But 
once more he decided against it. 
A line from a song ran crazily 
through his brain — Heaven can’t 
match you — and I’m not a statue. 



He bent and kissed her, very 
gently. He was thinking how 
much better the end of the real 
incident was than the end of the 
hallucination, in which he had 
killed her. 

B ACK in Rutledge, Corvey 
soon found the answers to 
the three most important ques- 
tions he could think of were yes, 
no and yes-and-no. 

Was he going to have access to 
secret material when the defense 
tests started? He was. 

Was he free of ritany and the 
worry, discomfort and extra dif- 
ficulty it caused? He was not. 

Was Sandra going to leave him 
alone? 

That was the yes-and-no. Be- 
cause there were really two ques- 
tions, two desired answers. He 
wanted Sandra to leave him 
alone, yet he didn’t. In fact, it 
became a question not of what 
Sandra did, but of what he did. 

He found himself, many times 
a day, thinking of Sandra quite 
involuntarily and, at the end of 
the day, missing her perceptibly 
more. He was falling in love with 
the girl, there wasn’t a doubt of 
it, and there seemed to be noth- 
ing he could do to stop it. He re- 
membered, quite well but with 
complete puzzlement, a time 
when he had known Sandra and 
yet hardly ever thought of her. 
He didn’t see Neave until 



142

I 



Monday. Neave detailed his part 
in the defense-test coverage. 

“I’ve done my best for you, 
Ken,” he said. “You know what 
defense officials are like where 
security is concerned. They want- 
ed us to present glowing reports 
without being told anything. But 
I got what I wanted, apart from 
you, without much trouble. We 
argued about you for quite a 
while.” 

He paused for encouragement. 
Corvey gave it to him. 

“Security wanted to give me 
their own survey reports. I said 
we used our own or none at all. 
They said they’d supply you with 
figures. I said that then you 
wouldn’t be able to draw any 
conclusions except the ones they 
wanted you to draw. That was 
just what they wanted, but they 
couldn’t very well say so. They 
said . 

He detailed with considerable 
self-satisfaction the whole course 
of the negotiations, ending, as he 
told it, in a complete victory for 
himself. Corvey congratulated 
him warmly. 

Survey reporting was still fair- 
ly new, and every survey report- 
er on a newspaper had to make 
sure, as a first step, that his su- 
periors understood something 
about the method. In a case like 
this, Corvey could accomplish 
nothing unless Neave understood 
his problems and did all he could 



to resolve them. So Corvey didn’t 
mind giving Neave a little soft 
soap if he wanted it. 

W HAT Neave had won for 
him was permission to go 
anywhere and ask anything — vir- 
tually an open sesame to the 
whole defense *est program. 

He couldn’t have asked for 
more. There was nothing more to 
ask for. 

Since he wasn’t quite free of 
ritany even in the best possible 
conditions, it wasn’t to be expect- 
ed that it would leave him alone 
when he returned to wbrk. And it 
didn’t. In fact, while the halluci- 
nations came less frequently than 
they had before he Went away 
and the headache and fever were 
less, the lighter, easily-seen- 
through delusions deepened once 
more. 

He tried to cover himself in 
advance by discreetly warning 
everybody that he would be 
working very hard in the next 
week or two, and was liable to be 
very absent-minded. Unfortu- 
nately, he had never been absent- 
minded before. People who 
weren’t very observant were pre- 
pared to accept this story — ob- 
servant people, or people who 
were really interested in him, like 
Dave, Babs and Jim Neave, 
looked incredulous at the sugges- 
tion. However, it was the best 
he could do.

Those last twenty-four hours 
he’d spent in Florida with San- 
dra had been quite perfect. She 
was a great person to be with, 
ready to respond to anything, de- 
manding nothing — quite unself- 
ish, devoid of egotism. She could 
talk about anything. During her 
fifteen years as an invalid, she 
had learned something about 
everything. 

She was that extreme rarity, 
the sensualist who understood 
that sensuality was only a small 
part of living. 

H E didn’t see her Monday or 
Tuesday, by a supreme ef- 
fort. Wednesday, he lunched with 
her, took her to a show in the 
evening and naturally took her 
home afterward. 

Quite by chance the conversa- 
tion took a turn which showed 
him some of her views on the 
Earth-colonies question. The 
wine she offered him at her house 
— it was a house, not an apart- 
ment, as he’d expected — was co- 
lonial, and as they sipped, they 
talked about the colonies. 

“Colonial politics are often 
pretty hard to follow,” Sandra 
observed. “Sometimes you’d al- 
most think they were afraid of 
Earth.” 

“So they are,” Corvey said. “I 
once knew a colonist pretty well, 
and from his point of view every 
colony is a little afraid of Earth.” 



“But why?” 

“Because she’s so strong. Be- 
cause Earth coul'd crush any col- 
ony like an insect.” 

“That’s nonsense,” Sandra de- 
clared. 

“Oh, no — it’s true.” 

“I don’t mean it isn’t true— if s 
the idea that’s ridiculous. You 
might as weil say everyone on the 
Moon should be terrified, because 
Earth could blow it to atoms 
without even sending up a man- 
ned ship.” 

Though he didn’t want to put 
himself in the position of arguing 
the colonies’ case, Corvey felt 
bound to say, trying to remain 
judicial, “That’s a different mat- 
ter, Sandra. The Moon is almost 
part of Earth.” 

“And aren’t the colonies almost 
part of Earth, too?” ^ 

“No, they’re independent 
worlds — or they could be. Inde- 
pendent, but never as strong as 
the parent world. Always an easy 
prey, if — ” 

“If Earth happened to want an 
easy prey. Ken, you don’t believe 
this yourself, do you?” 

“This fellow made a convinc- 
ing case.” 

“Ken, surely your friend and 
his whole world and the other 
colonies aren’t all suffering from 
paranoia?” 

“Paranoia?” 

“Well, what else can you call 
it, when their only reason for be- 



144 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ing hfraid is that Earth could de- 
stroy them — if she liked?” 

r | , HE question hung in the air 
-*• and went on hanging. Corvey 
never really knew whether he 
ducked it or Sandra neglected to 
follow it up. It was about that 
time that the conversation be- 
came more personal. 

It was Corvey who mentioned 
marriage again, tentatively, and 
impersonally, like the discussion 
on the colonies. Sandra discussed 
it in the same way. 

She was a little less adamant 
than when she had expressed her 
views on getting married. Per- 
haps she would marry sometime, 
if she found someone who had 
some of the qualities of Corvey, 
and if she believed he really 
didn’t care about not having chil- 
dren. 

That was Wednesday. 

Thursday, he examined what 
he had learned so far from the 
defense tests, fought no less than 
three minor battles with ritany 
and, although he didn’t see San- 
dra, felt himself compelled to call 
her twice. 

He hadn’t learned much of 
Earth’s defense potential in de- 
tail, but quite a lot in general. 
His Miami report to Jan Ryter, 
though it had been a hallucina- 
tion, turned out to be very close 
to the facts. As he had guessed, 
Earth was so far ahead of his own 



world in technical development 
that there was no prospect of the 
gap being closed, even if he had 
been a technician and could take 
back all the technical details. 

Earth was ahead, not with 
money in the bank, so to speak, 
not with talents buried in the 
ground, but with talents in active 
use. Earth’s potential was in her 
men rather than in anything they 
had done. Aramin scientists, given 
access to the Rutledge tests, 
could go home *and build weap- 
ons and defenses every bit as 
good as Earth’s — and it wouldn’t 
matter in the least. 

For, in the time taken to bring 
Aram up to Earth’s level, Earth 
would have forged ahead again. 

It wasn’t an encouraging re- 
port to have to make, but the 
essential thing about Corvey’s 
report was that it should be 
sound, not encouraging. 

He had called Sandra in the 
morning, and he called her again 
in the evening to cancel their 
date. He had to work at home as 
well as at the office while the 
tests were on. The trouble with 
survey reporting was that ninety 
per cent of the work was wasted. 

Friday . 

Though he didn’t know it at 
first, Friday was the day. There 
was nothing he could have done 
about it anyway. Everything was 
set to come to a focus at one 
point, and the point was Friday.

145 



F RIDAY MORNING. The de- 
fense tests were run in sec- 
tions. It was an open secret that 
Rutledge was being used for some 
military maneuver or other. Pre- 
cisely what was supposed to be 
unknown to anyone except the 
Army, the Air Force, the Space 
Navy, Washington, U.N., Secur- 
rity, the F.B.I. and “carefully 
screened units of the press.” This 
last designation included, appar- 
ently, everybody in Rutledge who 
wasn’t already included under 
the other heads, for everybody in 
Rutledge knew that the military 
maneuver was a complete test of 
all land-based defenses against 
any known form of attack from 
space. 

On Friday, the main item was 
reaction time. The initial stimu- 
lus for which every warning sys- 
tem was designed was taken for 
granted. The lag before retalia- 
tion took place was measured 
and correlated with every other 
lag — the amount of damage 
which would have been done in 
the meantime — the time a human 
being, rather than an automatic 
warning, needed to react — every- 
thing else it seemed worth while 
correlating it with. 

At eleven a.m. Corvey was 
standing in an open, empty space 
with about a score of other jour- 
nalists and observers, two miles 
out of Rutledge. In front of them, 
200 yards away, was something 



which looked like an. old-fash- 
ioned howitzer, manned by half a 
dozen men and girls. There were 
as many women as men in de- 
fense. To the left, 300 yards 
away, was the radar post. 

Someone spoke to Corvey, but 
it didn’t seem to matter. He was 
gloomily aware that many de- 
fense experts on Aram would 
have given their right arms to see 
the things he was seeing and 
would see. Unfortunately, only a 
survey reporter could have such 
opportunities — and as a survey 
reporter, he wasn’t trained to un- 
derstand more than a fraction of 
the significance of the things he 
saw. 

There was sudden movement 
at the radar post. A few seconds 
later, the spark of activity jump- 
ed the gap and the howitzer crew 
leaped about like flies. The blunt 
point of the machine swung 
around and up in one movement, 
and light stabbed from it. That 
part of it was rather an anti- 
climax. The light was only faint- 
ly brighter than the daylight it 
had to pass through, and gave 
the impression of a nearly ex- 
hausted battery. 

There was a sudden, startling 
'sound — a crack which was not 
loud but curiously vicious. With 
it was a faint stirring of the still 
air. A vacuum only a foot or so 
in diameter but eight hundred 
miles long was being filled — or 



146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



rather, had been filled almost as 
it was being created — and these 
were the after-effects. 

A long moment of tension, as 
if everyone were waiting for the 
plop of a penny dropped down a 
well. 

Then a speck appeared and be- 
came a ship, dropping. Again 
someone spoke to Corvey unin- 
telligibly — his eyes and everyone 
else’s were on the ship. It grew 
incredibly slowly, though it must 
be falling out of control — the 
howitzer crew was paying no fur- 
ther attention to it, apparently 
satisfied that it was no longer a 
menace. The radar crew was still 
busy, however, tracking it. 

S OMETHING seemed oddly 
familiar about the ship. Even 
before he could have known, Cor- 
vey was straining his eyes, hop- 
ing his wild guess was wrong. 

It wasn’t — the ship was an 
Aramin cruiser. It came hurtling 
down, spinning, its rear section 
misshapen. It struck about a mile 
away and was hidden for a mo- 
ment in a cloud of flying earth 
and stones. 

“Mr. Corvey!” came a sharp, 
insistent bark. “I must ask you 
to come and see Captain Swan.” 
With a start, Corvey turned. 
His eyes took in nothing but a 
uniform, then flicked back to the 
wrecked Aramin ship. 

There was no ship. There had 



never been any ship at all. 

He had been embroidering on 
the test. Vaguely, he was aware 
that the officer beside him had 
been trying to attract his atten- 
tion for some time, without suc- 
cess. 

“Sorry,” he said. “I was work- 
ing something out.” 

The other spectators were star- 
ing at the two of them. His trance 
must have been deep and puz- 
zling. The officer beside him was 
red-faced, nervous, yet adamant. 

“Sure,” Corvey said. “Where 
is this Captain Swan?” 

He was led across to the radar 
unit. He tried to dissolve the ap- 
pearance of being a prisoner un- 
der guard, but without much 
success. The correspondents chat- 
tered as he was led away, and his 
escorting officer kept dropping a 
step behind, his hand rather mel- 
odramatically thrust into his 
pocket. 

It was difficult to decide which 
attitude to assume, the indiffer- 
ent or the indignant. Meanwhile, 
he pretended not to notice that 
he was in effect a prisoner. 

His escort asked him to stand 
aside while he talked to Captain 
Swan, watched him closely while 
he did so, and generally made it 
quite obvious that Corvey was 
suspected of something pretty 
serious. 

Corvey made up his mind. He 
strode forward. “What is this?” 



SPY 



147 




he demanded. “I’m Kenneth Cor- 
vey of the Rutledge Star — a doz- 
en people here can swear to that. 
And if you want my authoriza- 
tion ...” 

“That’s not the question, Mr. 
Corvey,” said Swan bluntly. He 
was a brusque, neat little man. 
“It seems there were several at- 
tempts made to attract your at- 
tention, without success. I’m told 
you were in some sort of trance 
for at least four minutes. Have 
you any explanation?” 

“I’ve given it already,” Corvey 
retorted. “I’m a survey reporter 
— that means a big proportion of 
my work is mental arithmetic, so 
to speak. This requires extreme 
concentration — ” 

“I understand that, Mr. Cor- 
vey. But it seems your concen- 
tration, as you call it, was too 
deep and impenetrable for any 
such straightforward explanation. 
I feel sure there must be some — 
some further explanation.” 

“What, for heaven’s sake?” 
Corvey demanded, allowing him- 
self to sound a little angrier. “Is 
it a crime not to speak when I’m 
spoken to?” 

“If you don’t cooperate with 
us, Mr. Corvey,” said Swan dis- 
tantly, “you will find our coop- 
eration with you will rapidly 
cease.” 

“How can I cooperate with 
you? What do you want? Of what 
crime am I accused, and what 



148 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




will you recognize as a defense?” 

Swan began to realize his posi- 
tion was weaker than he thought, 
was weakening further. In a more 
propitiating tone, he said, “You 
realize how careful we have to be, 
Mr. Corvey, and you know your- 
self how thoroughly all observers 
have been screened. We must in- 
vestigate everything we can’t un- 
derstand, and this trance of yours 
— it is possible, say, that you’ve 
been telepathically tapped, or 
that some post-hypnotic sugges- 
tion has been planted, or . .” 

“Captain Swan,” said Corvey 
firmly but not angrily any more, 
“I realize that you must be care- 
ful, but surely that doesn’t mean 
fanciful. I’ve offered you a per- 
fectly reasonable explanation for 
something which doesn’t seem in 
the least strange to me. You don’t 
know how reasonable it is, un- 
less you’ve heard the noise that 
goes on outside the office where 
I have to work. Now, would you 
like me to write down for your 
perusal some of the lines of in- 
vestigation I covered mentally?” 

With still less conviction, Swan 
said, “You know we don’t suspect 
you, Mr. Corvey. It’s just a mat- 
ter of checking. Would you sub- 
mit to a brief test? It’s simply to 
establish — ” 

“No,” said Corvey. He hated 
to have to say it, but there was 
no telling what a test might show. 
If they simply stuck a thermome- 

SPY 



149 




ter in his mouth, they would start 
to ask awkward questions. If 
they had a skilled lie-detector 
operator, they would get some 
very interesting answers. 

“Oh?” said Swan, with a rapid 
return to his earlier manner. 
“Why not, Mr. Corvey?” 

And though Corvey didn’t hes- 
itate and gave no outward sign 
of diminished confidence, he 
knew that from now on he was 
going to be less and less convinc- 
ing. 

F RIDAY AFTERNOON. Cor- 
vey left the Security office 
cleared and puzzled. He had sub- 
mitted to some tests and refused 
others, and the two men he saw — 
interrogators in quite a different 
class fom Captain Swan — seemed 
satisfied. But he knew that those 
two would seem precisely as they 
wished to seem, quite indepen- 
dently of what they might think. 

He guessed that he was strong- 
ly suspected and would be very 
closely watched, indeed, from 
now on. It was quite possible, 
from the way he had been treat- 
ed, that he had been suspected 
all along, that Security Head- 
quarters was rather annoyed with 
its own low-level operatives for 
pulling him in. 

It even occurred to him that, 
possibly, some close associate of 
his — Babs, Dave, Jim Neave or 
Sandra — was watching him, had 



been watching him from the start. 

At any rate, from now on he 
couldn’t afford to do anything 
outside the normal requirements 
of his job. AS might suspect him 
slightly, strongly or with com- 
plete certainty. There was little 
or no possibility that he was not 
suspected at all. 

He hadn’t completely failed by 
any means. He would continue 
to have access to secret informa- 
tion, would be permitted to ob- 
serve many of the further defense 
tests. But he would be trusted 
with nothing which really mat- 
tered from now on. 

When Dave and Babs met him 
just outside the Security office, 
his suspicion that they were AS 
operatives heightened. However, 
it would be stupid to give any 
hint of that. 

“Say, what’s this?” Babs asked, 
concerned. “Security called us a 
while back about you. But it’s all 
right now, isn’t it?” 

“It’s all right,” said Corvey 
easily. “Security’s checking ev- 
eryone about half a dozen times 
while these . but maybe I 
shouldn’t say anything about 
what’s going on just now, for of- 
ficially nothing’s happening at 
all.” 

“Oh, can it, Ken,” said Babs. 
“You needn’t start being super- 
cautious with us. We gave you a 
magnificent character — I think 
you ought to stand us a drink, as 



150 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



a small token of your apprecia- 
tion.” 

Corvey stood them a drink. 
Whether they were in AS or not 
didn’t make much difference to 
his liking for them. After all, he 
had been deceiving them the 
whole time he had known them. 
He could hardly complain if 
they’d been deceiving him, too. 

Sandra darted into the bar and 
kissed him in relief at the sight 
of him. She ignored Babs and 
Dave. 

“Thank goodness!” she said 
breathlessly. “The way they talk- 
ed to me over the phone, I 
thought you were in jail for life, 
if not just until they shot you. 
Will you excuse us, folks? 
Thanks.” 

She swept him away to the 
other corner of the bar, where 
Babs and Dave couldn’t hear 
what they were saying. 

“Tell me, Ken,” she said seri- 
ously. “Did they let you go be- 
cause you’re not a spy or because 
they couldn’t prove it?” 

Things had changed since the 
last time he considered telling her 
the truth. “Neither,” he said 
coolly. “I think they know I’m a 
spy, but they’re waiting to see 
what I do.” 

“You are a spy?” she asked 
quietly. 

“Yes. Oh, a most unspectacular 
spy. Not like the dashing spies 
of romance. I’m not here to steal 



the plans of secret weapons, just 
to get a general idea of Earth’s 
potentialities.” 

“For whom? The highest bid- 
der?” 

The bitterness of her question 
hurt him, though it was only to 
be expected. 

“No,” he said. “For my own 
world — Aram. And not for offen- 
sive purposes. There’s no ques- 
tion of Aram ever — ” 

“There never is,” Sandra re- 
torted, not angry but bitterly dis- 
appointed. “It’s never anybody’s 
hand that fires the shot. Nobody 
ever wants to fight. Every battle 
that was ever fought was fought 
in self-defense, apparently.” 

Corvey sighed. “I know. Study 
history and you find . .” 

It stopped just there, for no 
reason, and Babs and Dave were 
staring at him. He knew it was 
a repetition of the morning’s hal- 
lucinatory incident. 

TTE was in the cocktail bar all 
right, with Babs and Dave — 
that part had happened. But the 
arrival of Sandra, like the fall of 
the Aramin ship, had been super- 
imposed, and he had gone dead 
to all intents and purposes, judg- 
ing by his friends’ expressions. 

People returning to conscious- 
ness often do ask, “Where am I?” 
— fatuous though it may be — be- 
cause the first seconds of inter-

characterized by notable alert- 
ness and perspicacity. 

Dave spoke before he could 
think of anything else to say. 
“That’s what happened this af- 
ternoon, isn’t it?” he asked 
shrewdly. 

There was no use denying it. 
Corvey nodded. “I know about 
it,” he said. “It doesn’t worry me, 
and it is temporary. But it’s not 
an easy thing to explain.” 

“I can understand that,” Dave 
agreed. 

“Say, what is this?” Babs 
asked. “Periodic trances? How 
and where did you pick them 
up?” 

“I’ve been trying to explain 
that all afternoon,” said Corvey 
wearily. “Mind if I take a rest 
now?” 

“Well, sure,” said Dave slow- 
ly. “But there’s a difference now, 
Ken. Security organizations are 
never exactly sympathetic. We 
are. Like to try us?” 

If they were AS agents, they 
knew about him. If they weren’t, 
they were just Dave and Babs, 
his friends. If he refused to say 
anything, they were capable of 
working out what he was refusing 
to say. 

He was finished anyway. Ap- 
parently this was going to go on 
happening, the gradual merging 
of a real incident into ritanic hal- 
lucination, with trance instead of 
the absent-minded, automatic 



behavior which previously had 
enabled him to get by without 
arousing suspicion. When that 
had been the case, carrying on 
had been risky but not impos- 
sible. 

Now it was impossible. He 
hadn’t seen it when he left the 
Security office, but that had been 
before the second trance. Trances 
like this were not part of the nor- 
mal case-history of ritany. Quite 
possibly, ritany took a different 
course on planets other than 
Aram. If more trances were to be 
expected, he would have to be 
content with what little he had 
learned already, go into hiding, 
and leave Earth with his job in- 
differently done — but alive, 
instead of carrying on until, 
inevitably, he was arrested. 

“All right,” he said quietly. 
“I’ll take you up on that. Does 
what Dave say go for you, too, 
Babs?” 

“Of course,” she said. “Shoot.” 
She leaned forward eagerly, in- 
tuitively aware that what Corvey 
said was going to be interesting. 

“I’ve got a fever,” Corvey said, 
“which identifies my world, which 
isn’t Earth. That’s why I’ve had 
to fight the fever, couldn’t admit 
it, couldn’t take sick leave. If I 
had, it would soon have been dis- 
covered that I’m not a Terran as 
I pretend, that my whole history 
is false — that, in fact, I could only 
be here as a spy.”

TN several delusions he had ad- 
mitted to Babs and Dave or 
to Sandra, in one way or another, 
that he was a spy. This time, the 
incident being real, he checked it 
and found it true. He was shar- 
ing his secret with someone at 
last. 

“You’re working for another 
world against Earth?” asked 
Dave quietly. Babs caught her 
breath. 

“Not exactly. I . " 

“We can’t help you, Ken,” said 
Dave in the same quiet tone. “I’m 
sorry if I led you to think we 
could. I didn’t believe you could 
possibly be — ” 

“Don’t make excuses, Dave,” 
Babs cut in. “It was an offer to 
a friend and I hope Ken’s still 
that. But, Ken, you should have 
known we weren’t traitors. Look 
— let’s forget these last few 
things were said, shall we?” 

Corvey nodded wearily. They 
were reacting much as Sandra 
had in the first hallucination — 
the way decent people, patriotic 
without being fanatic about it, 
would act— he supposed. 

“I think we’d better go,” said 
Babs, getting up. “We certainly 
won’t give you up, Ken. But 
we can’t help you and we’d bet- 
ter not talk about this at all. If 
we — when we see you again, I 
think we should ignore today al- 
together . .” 

But when she said that, she 



knew and Corvey knew they 
wouldn’t see him again unless, 
perhaps, as witnesses at his trial. 

Corvey tested the whole inci- 
dent for reality once again and 
found it solid. But everything else 
was falling apart at the seams. 

He should have known how 
Babs and Dave would react. Yet 
what did it matter, since Secur- 
ity was so close behind him any- 
way? 

Babs and Dave, he was now 
certain, were not AS agents. He 
was also certain that they could 
be trusted — they wouldn’t give 
him up. What he had to do was 
get under cover. Now, tonight. 

He shouldn’t even have thought 
of Sandra, but he did. 

He wanted to go and see her, 
to find what she would say — 
really say — whether it would be 
the same as Babs’ and Dave’s 
reaction. For a while, he tried 
to convince himself that since he 
was on the run anyway, as of 
now, it made no difference, his 
calling Sandra on the way. 

But he wasn’t sufficiently 
blinded by love to be able to 
believe that. 

No, he couldn’t afford to see 
Sandra, even to say good-by. 

VI 

F riday evening. The last 

time he had been at Sandra’s 
house he had been interested only 



SPY

in her, not the house. He had a 
little difficulty finding it again 
in the darkness. 

It had taken him an hour or 
two to arrange things and, after 
that, he had walked most of the 
way to Sandra’s house. He would 
have liked to call her, to make 
sure she wasn’t out — but the 
phone might be tapped. That was 
another reason why he shouldn’t 
go near her. If AS were really 
watching him closely, they’d 
know all about Sandra. 

He found it at last, a small 
house in its own tiny patch of 
garden. He looked about careful- 
ly to make sure no one was watch- 
ing the place — not that he had 
thought it likely anyone would 
be. Moderately satisfied, he still 
didn’t go to the front door, but 
circled the house cautiously, 
found a lane which touched the 
rear wall at one point and climb- 
ed over. 

There was light in a curtained 
upstairs window. Corvey had had 
certain training which he hadn’t 
used for a long time, but which 
he had begun to call on again 
from the time he’d decided to go 
under cover. Within three min- 
utes, he was inside the house and 
outside the door of the room 
where the light was on. 

Thus ended his determination 
not to see Sandra again. 

He tapped and said, “It’s me 
—Ken.” 



There was a stifled shriek. Ccr- 
vey waited. Presently Sandra’s 
voice said challengingly, “If it’s 
Ken, say something else.” 

He said something that proved 
he was Corvey. Then, when she 
sounded somewhat reassured, he 
slipped inside, flicking off the 
light-switch as he did so. 

“What on earth . .?” came 
Sandra’s voice in the darkness. 

He found her and, despite her 
surprise and puzzlement, she was 
prepared to throw her arms 
around him and kiss him readily 
enough. But she still wanted to 
know why he had sought her 
like that — he could feel the curi- 
osity pulsing through her body. 

“This place of yours would be 
the easiest job in months for 
housebreakers, darling,” he mur- 
mured. 

“Come on, Ken — give!” 

He told her. 

She didn’t say a word until 
she was in possession of all the 
main facts. But she was still in 
his arms, and her body would 
have told him if what he was tell- 
ing her shocked or disgusted her. 

Twice in fevered delusions he 
had told her this — each time 
she had turned from him. It was 
natural that he should have hal- 
lucinations about her finding out. 

N OW it was actually happen- 
ing — and so far she hadn’t 
turned from him in disgust. Her 



154 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



arms were still around him, her 
breath mingling with his. 

“You’re giving up the Rutledge 
defense tests altogether,” she 
asked coolly, “and hiding out 
until you can be picked -up and 
go back to Aram?” 

“Yes.” 

“And — if it hadn’t been for 
this, things might have been very 
different between us?” 

“They certainly would.” 

“And you’re still ill?” 

“Yes. But when I’m lucid, I 
know what I’m saying, and I 
mean it.” 

“That isn’t what I meant. I’m 
coming with you, Ken.” 

He caught his breath. That 
had been too much to hope for — 
he wasn’t ready for it. 

“That doesn’t mean I agree 
with what you’ve been doing or 
would help you against Earth. I 
wouldn’t.” 

He tightened his grip, but she 
avoided his lips. “Never mind 
that just now. Have you any 
plans — workable plans?” 

“Oh, yes,” Corvey said. “I 
could have done this for a long 
time, but I didn’t when there was 
still a chance.” 

“Forget that. You can’t expect 
me to be sympathetic because 
you’ve failed in an espionage job 
for some other world.” 

“Wait a minute, Sandra. Why 
are you coming with me?” 

“Because I love you, fool! But 



that doesn’t mean I love your 
job, or . Don’t waste time 
arguing. What are we going to 
do?” 

He released her, stepped back 
and snapped on the light. She 
blinked for a moment, then gave 
a startled cry. 

The man in the room with her 
wasn’t Ken Corvey. This man 
had lighter hair, held himself 
differently, had brown eyes in- 
stead of blue and a smaller nose. 
The differences were slight, but 
she would have passed this man 
in the street without a second 
glance. 

“I see,” she said, recovering 
herself. “Which is you?” 

“Neither,” said Corvey. Now 
his voice was different, too. 

TTE looked at her as he had 
never looked at her before 
— wondering how her appearance 
could be simply and significantly 
altered. He had some materials, 
in case he should have to change 
his own appearance again, but 
not a great deal. 

He managed it in seventeen 
minutes, by darkening her hair 
and getting her to change its 
style while he made her mouth 
fuller and her cheeks thinner. She 
was startled at the latter opera- 
tion, her hand going to her face. 

“That ointment tightens your 
face muscles,” he said. “Don’t 
touch it. When it’s dried, it’ll last 



SPY 



155 



for twenty-four hours or so. 
There, you don’t look much 
worse than usual, if quite dif- 
ferent.” 

He didn’t let her look at her- 
self until she was dressed in 
clothes which he selected and 
modified with her help. When 
she did look in a full-length mir- 
ror, she gasped, horrified. 

“I look awful!” she wailed. , 

“Not really. You just look dif- 
ferent. Of course, those are 
clothes you’d regard as all wrong 
for you — I made them like that. 
People have a pattern of ap- 
pearance, speech, walk, clothes. 
All you have to do to become a 
different person is to change the 
pattern. Just remember you’re 
the girl in the mirror, not Sandra 
Reid.” 

Sandra locked up the house 
and left it without any signs of 
a hurried departure. She also 
dropped a brief line to her em- 
ployers. They walked some dis- 
tance, so that no cabby would 
remember picking up a man and 
a woman at Sandra Reid’s house, 
then took a taxi to the airport. 

By agreement, Corvey was tell- 
ing her only the next step, so 
that, in the event of something 
going wrong, she wouldn’t know 
his whole plan. If anything did 
go wrong, she would naturally go 
home. Corvey could always com- 
municate with her there. 

The next step, after the local 



airport, was a flight to any big 
airport. Sandra didn’t know their 
destination from there. 

C ORVEY reflected, while he 
paid the taxi driver, that 
they would certainly be traced 
eventually to the airport, then 
to New York or San Francisco 
or wherever they flew. He would 
have to make sure the trail was 
much weaker from there, and 
quite untraceable from the next 
check point. His destination was 
Kingston, Jamaica, but he had 
to be quite certain he left no 
trail — Kingston was the last 
refuge of any Aramin agent on 
Earth. 

They found the next plane was 
to New York, which suited Cor- 
vey well enough. Corvey booked 
passage under names he didn’t 
even bother remembering — they 
weren’t going to need them again. 
They went to the waiting room 
to spend the twenty minutes be- 
fore the plane left. 

And the first person Corvey 
saw when he followed Sandra 
inside was Jim Neave. 

He paid no attention. Sandra, 
who didn’t know Neave, was say- 
ing something which didn’t mat- 
ter, but she might easily switch 
at any moment to something 
which did. Corvey cut her off 
rudely, hoping she would guess 
why. She didn’t immediately. 
She started and shot a surprised 



156 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



glance at him. To make sure she 
had a chance to think for a 
second or two before bursting 
out with something catastrophic, 
he hurried past her to look out 
one of the big windows at the 
planes, digging her warningly in 
the ribs while his body shielded 
her from Neave. 

When she joined him at the 
window, she had clearly taken 
the hint. She was docile and 
quiet, taking her cue from him. 

Corvey hadn’t looked closely 
at Neave, but he was aware his 
boss was still watching him. That 
Neave was there looking for 
him was practically certain — he 
should have been at the office. 
The only question was whether 
Neave was an AS agent or mere- 
ly someone who could identify 
Ken Corvey. The fact that he 
appeared to be alone suggested 
he was an AS agent. But he might 
not be as alone as he seemed. 

Corvey’s disguise was designed 
to defeat descriptions and pho- 
tographs, not to fool anyone who 
knew him well. He didn’t dare 
look at Neave. He was hoping 
Neave wasn’t an AS agent for, 
if he was, he would know his job 
and have Corvey investigated. 

Corvey took Sandra’s arm and 
said in a voice which was not 
the one Neave knew, “Place 
stinks. Come on out in the fresh 
air.” 

Neave was at his elbow. “Ex- 



cuse me, sir . he began. 

As Corvey turned and looked 
at him, he saw complete cer- 
tainty come into Neave’s face. 
Perhaps Neave, knowing some- 
thing like this might happen, had 
carefully noted a tiny scar or 
irregularity on his face, some- 
thing which even Corvey didn’t 
know about. At any rate, there 
could be no further pretense. 

C ORVEY doubled Neave up 
with a stomach punch and 
chopped him behind the ear. The 
gun which was halfway out of 
Neave’s pocket clattered on the 
floor. Corvey didn’t take time to 
pick it up. He kicked it and sent 
it sliding along the floor under 
a sofa. 

All the people standing about 
had seen the incident, or at least 
part of it. Corvey decided a bluff 
wouldn’t pay. There was nothing 
for it but to run. 

He seized Sandra’s arm again 
and, from the rapidity with 
which she got off her mark, she 
seemed to have the same idea. 
They darted out to the concrete. 

“All right, stand where you 
are,” said a voice sharply. 

Corvey didn’t know quite what 
the danger was before it was re- 
moved. When he turned, a man 
was pitching forward, his gun 
flying from his hand, and Sandra 
was rubbing her leg. 

“Well done!" Corvey gasped. 



SPY 



157 



“I don’t know what you did, 
Sandra, but it was good.” 

They jumped on a luggage 
trolley and Corvey sent it trund- 
ling away from the brilliantly lit 
strip in front of the waiting-room 
windows. 

“It would be futile to take up 
& plane, even if we could,” Cor- 
vey saicj- “The thing to do is get 
back into town and get out by 
train or bus. That’s the only — ” 

Two of the small fat tires of 
the trolley were shot out and it 
scraped to a stop with a final 
earsplitting scream of steel on 
concrete. Corvey didn’t see where 
the shots came from, but the 
shooting was so precise and so 
obviously intended to stop them, 
without harming them, that he 
knew he and Sandra might just 
as well stay where they were and 
wait to be taken in custody. 

Nevertheless, they did the na- 
tural thing and dashed for the 
edge of the field. It wasn’t the 
first time Corvey had experienced 
the sensation of crawling physical 
terror which came with the 
knowledge .that, at any moment, 
a bullet might tear through any 
part of his body, but he knew it 
was probably the first time San- 
dra had felt it: He was sorry 
he had dragged her into this. 

There were still no extra lights, 
no signs of undue confusion, no 
hue and cry. Just Neave, the 
man outside and the two shots 



which had put the trolley out of 
action. 

Sandra gasped suddenly, and 
Corvey turned his head to see 
her go down. Someone had made 
a neat football tackle on her. 

He didn’t see what happened 
after that, for something hard 
came down on his head and 
seemed to drive him into the 
ground like a stake. 

F riday night, corvey 

opened his eyes a bit and saw 
Sandra’s legs. There could have 
been worse awakenings — nev- 
ertheless, Sandra’s legs were an 
irrelevance in the circumstances 
as he remembered them. He 
opened his eyes fully. 

“With us again, Ken?” said 
Neave. 

They were in a small office at 
the airport. Sandra was in an 
armchair, watching him. She did- 
n’t appear to be hurt. She smiled 
wryly as his gaze met hers. 
Neave was standing over him 
and, behind, were two other men. 

Corvey didn’t say anything. 
He was now completely in the 
power of AS. Anything they did- 
n’t know they could soon find out 
by the use of truth drugs. One 
good thing was that interroga- 
tion would show Sandra wasn’t 
involved with him. 

“We could put you against a 
wall and shoot you, of course,” 
Neave said, “but we’re not going 



158 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to. I’ll put you out of your sus- 
pense, Ken. First, as you prob- 
ably know very well, we’re going 
to drug you and find out all you 
know. Assuming that’s no more 
than we expect, and that your 
assignment is what we think it is, 
we’ll give you a short treatment 
and then you can come back on 
the staff of the Star in your old 
job. 

“Wait a minute — don’t let’s 
have any misunderstanding. 
When I say you can come back, 
I mean you’re coming back by 
order. We’ll shoot you if you 
don’t.” 

“You want me to work for 
you, for AS, in fact?” Corvey 
said. 

Neave nodded. “That’s it. And 
don’t say you won’t. That’s a 
waste of breath and time.” 

Corvey marveled at the way 
Neave’s manner stayed exactly 
the same, yet seemed much more 
effective now that he was an AS 
operative and not merely a fea- 
ture editor. 

“How about Sandra?” Corvey 
asked. 

Neave shrugged. “We’ve al- 
ready questioned Miss Reid. 
We’ve nothing against her. In 
fact, she’s with us.” 

Corvey started. “All the time?” 

“Yes, but not the way you 
mean. Aren’t you going to take 
me up on the ‘short treatment’ I 
mentioned?” 



- ■ " 

“I can guess about that,” Cor- 
vey said shortly. “You mean 
psychological treatment.” 
“Exactly. But hasn’t it oc- 
curred to you that you may need 
it?” 

|^ORVEY grinned without hu- 
^ mor. “If I’m going to stay 
alive, I do.” 

“Not only that — you do need 
psychiatric treatment, Ken. It 
seems Miss Reid once told you 
about it, only she didn’t know 
what she was saying applied to 
you.” 

“What are you talking about?” 
“Paranoia. Like all colonials, 
you think Earth’s against you. 
You’re wrong. And after your 
treatment . .” 

“I know, I’ll think what you 
want me to think after my 
brain’s been tampered with.” 
Neave shook his head. “You 
still won’t even admit it’s pos- 
sible,” he said patiently. “I wish 
you would, Ken. It would make 
us all feel better. We don’t shoot 
colonial spies, because we don’t 
have to, and because they’re not 
responsible. We just cure them 
and, after that, they’re good AS 
agents. They disappear or report 
nonsense to their own worlds or 
they go back — under our protec- 
tion, of course — and no doubt the 
colony concerned thinks we’ve 
done something terrible to them, 
because they’ve changed. Maybe 



SPY 



159 



you weren’t told about that.” 
Sandra joined in. “Paranoia is 
a sort of inferiority complex, 
Ken,” she said quietly, “and na- 
turally the colonies tend to feel 
that way about Earth. You’re 
not insane — only strongly prej- 
udiced on one point. They’ll take 
away that prejudice, that’s all.” 

C ORVEY looked from one to 
the other. He knew that what 
they said was false, that he was 
going to have an artificial devo- 
tion to Earth set up in him and 
have his love of Aram broken 
down. 

But he couldn’t stop them, 
anyway. And the way Sandra 
was looking at him showed that 
she hadn’t changed her mind 
about him since she agreed to 
come away with him. 

“All right,” he said. “I’ll admit 
it’s possible, if it gives you any 
satisfaction. I suppose it’s a 
pretty humane way to treat spies 
anyway — -I’ve no complaints. I 
suppose AS knew about me all 
the time, since you were planted 
at the Star when I came?” 

“We . didn’t know about you 
until just the other day,” said 
Neave, “and we weren’t sure un- 
til today. And I wasn’t planted, 
Ken. You should know that. 
Think I’m an amateur feature 
editor? No, that’s my job.” 
“What’s your AS connection, 
then?” Corvey asked curiously. 



“Same as yours — or as yours 
will be. I was once a colonial spy, 
too.” 

And suddenly Corvey under- 
stood the blinding .efficiency of 
AS. Morally right or morally 
wrong — Corvey didn’t know — 
Earth had and was going to con- 
tinue to have the best counter- 
espionage system in the entire 
Galaxy. 

AS was carnivorous. It swal- 
lowed the operatives of every 
world in the Galaxy except 
Earth and turned them into its 
own flesh. 

It was a pretty good system.
