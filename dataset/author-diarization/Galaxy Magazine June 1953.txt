PEBBLE 
II THE SKY 

hy Isaac Asimov 



It began when Joseph Schwartz was walking down a street in 
Chicago, past the Institute for Nuclear Research. He raised one 
foot in the twentieth century; he lowered it in Galactic Era 827, 
the victim of an odd accident inside the Institute involving an 
experiment with crude uranium. 

Schwartz awoke to a strange world — he was still on Earth, but 
at a time when all the planets of the Galaxy were inhabited, and 
the people of Earth were outcasts, suffering vindictive discrimina- 
tion because their tiny world was radioactive! 

His subsequent adventures involved Schwartz in a brewing 
revolution of the Earth militarists, and a romance between the 
daughter of an eminent Earth scientist and a young Galactic 
archeologist. Then, strangely, it was the little retired tailor from 
Chicago who found himself the only man who could avert the im- 
pending cosmic disaster. But Schwartz, homesick and confused, 
wasn't sure he even cared 1 

Combining tenseness, irony, romance, and fast action with a 
basis of really intriguing science, Pebble in the Sky is a truly 
ingenious tale of the far-distant future.

OF ALL THINGS 



TN spite of its turbulence, or 
-*■ maybe because of it, our era 
is rolling out a seemingly endless 
belt of miracles that were “impos- 
sible” only yesterday. 

That’s the surface phenomenon. 
There are three others, however, 
that are more significant in fore- 
guessing possible future trends: 

• The flow of marvels is accele- 
rating instead of slowing down, 
which is astonishing only if you 
follow the wrong line of reason- 
ing. 

Discoveries, even supposedly 
ultimate ones, generally lead to 
others, which in turn make still 
others possible. The vacuum 
pump, for instance, gave impetus 
to research and produced electric 
lights, radio, TV and vacuum 
cleaners. We haven’t seen the 
final results of the Curies’ experi- 
ments with radium. When the 
security wraps can be taken off 
the physical sciences, we are like- 
ly to find that entire new fields 
have been opened up, which will 
open up many more. 

For science fiction writers, the 
devil of it is that none of us can 
even imagine what those advances 
will be. And to make it still worse, 
what further discoveries will those 
advances lead to? 

• Sociologically, the attitude to- 
ward these discoveries is impor : 
tant, for as fast as former impos- 



sibilities become reality, they are 
accepted and absorbed — some- 
times prematurely, as with 
Chloromycetin, sometimes too 
uncritically, as with chlorophyll 
— which is a great contrast to the 
caution of the past. The willing- 
ness to accept innovations also is 
accelerating. 

There are risks involved, of 
course. Whenever a societal pen- 
dulum swings, it follows New- 
ton’s third law — -to every action 
there is an equal and opposite 
reaction — and swings too far. But 
it does come back. Besides, we 
have enough professional, indus- 
trial and governmental safeguards 
to make the risk small in com- 
parison with the gains. 

• Rather than creating greater 
complexity, very many of these 
discoveries simplify things. The 
transistor is a good example. 
Medicine is another — a general 
practitioner today, using modem 
drugs, can combat more major 
diseases more effectively than a 
whole group of specialists a few 
years ago. 

Great discoveries aren’t merely 
more damned things to add to 
our technical warehouse. They 
often unify masses of previously 
unrelated data. 

It’s a bit hard to find a book 
that commits as many mental 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



assaults on the reader as Charles 
Galton Darwin’s The Next Mil- 
lion Years, which is probably 
reason enough to fight back, but 
that’s not my purpose in men- 
tioning it. 

Sir Charles tells us that the 
human race is coming unglued 
because the “superior” element 
is allowing the “inferior” to out- 
produce it. The ancient Greeks 
and Romans also yelped about 
that situation — and for the same 
reason, which Sir Charles and 
his too-numerous co-yelpers ne- 
glect to analyze. 

The plain fact is that a large 
family is an economic asset to 
the poor, a liability to the better- 
heeled. As long as the children 
of the poor boost the family in- 
come by working, it’s absurd to 
hope that the poor will start hav- 
ing small families. 

Don’t look at me— I have no 
answer, except that a number of 
children of poor families have 
made the race a lot richer. 

Josue de Castro’s The Geogra- 
phy of Hunger claims that mal- 
nutrition increases human fertil- 
ity. All we have to do then is feed 
the overproducers until they start 
reproducing sensibly. The “how” 
might be a problem — but then 
there’d be still more economic 
advantage in having large fami- 
lies. And how would it help if 



the “superior” element began 
breeding unrestrainedly? It would 
only help crowd us off the planet 
that much sooner. 

To smooth the feathers ruf- 
fled by my statement that we are 
not facing inflation, one reader 
suggests this diplomatic formula : 
“Price and income could be 
aligned more equitably.” 

Well, sure, of course they could 
be. But how often have they been, 
and for how long? I recommend 
parity for the whole country — 
but let George administer it, not 
me. 

Science fiction shares a won- 
derful privilege with news ana- 
lysts — both can solve the 
problems of the world without 
leaving the desk. The difference, 
of course, is that we label our 
opinions “guesses,” while ana- 
lysts claim omniscience. 

There must be something 
wrong somewhere in the analysis 
business. If they were that good, 
we wouldn’t need so many of 
them. One would be enough to 
tell us what’s going to happen 
and why. 

Odder still, science fiction, 
dealing with guesses just for men- 
tal and emotional stimulation, 
has a better record.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Jadiver objected to being the greatest influence for good on 
Venus . because what was good for Venus was bad for Jadiver! 



Illustrated by EMSH 




S OMEBODY was wrapping 
him in a sheet of ice and 
spice. Somebody was pull- 
ing it tight so that his toes ached 
and his fingers tingled. He still 
had fingers, and eyes too. He 
opened his eyes and they turned 
in opposite directions and couldn’t 
focus on what they saw. He made 
an effort, but couldn’t keep it up 
and had to let his eyes flutter 
shut again. 

“Rest. You’re all right.” That’s 
where he got the idea of ice and 
spice — from that voice. 

“Mmmm,” said Jadiver. He 
tried to raise his hand, but it 
wouldn’t move. It was good ad- 
vice — to rest; he couldn’t do 
otherwise. “What happened?” he 
whispered. 

“You had an accident. Remem- 
ber?” 

He didn’t. It was his mind

playing tricks, of course. It 
couldn’t have be« n pleasant if his 
memory didn’t have access to it. 

“Mmmm,” he evaded. 

“Go to sleep. 'We’ll talk later.” 

He thought he felt something 
shoved deep in his flesh, but he 
may have been wrong. In any 
event, the light that filtered 
through his closed eyelids faded 
away and the external world, of 
which there wasn’t much in the 
first place, vanished completely. 

T ATER, he awakened. How 
much later, he didn’t know, 
but it may have been days. The 
oppressive languor had left him 
and he felt capable of movement. 
To prove it to himself, he turned 
his head. He W£j S alone, and he 
thought he recognized where he 
was. He didn’t like it. 

There was an odor in the room, 
but this time it Was the kind that 
lingers in all hospitals. He tried 
to sit up, but th^t was more than 
he could manage;. He lay there a 
long time, looking through the 
heavily reinforce^ window; then 
someone came ii\. 

“You’ll live,” said the voice be- 
hind him — the s^me voice. 

“Think so?” He hadn’t intend- 
ed to turn aroumd, but the spice 
was back and hie wanted to see. 
It was only th-e fragrance she 
wore — there was none in her 
voice or demeanor. That was still 
ice. 



When she sat down, he could 
see that her hair was a shade of 
copper and the uniform she wore 
a dark green. She was not a robot 
and therefore not a nurse or a 
guard. It was logical to assume 
she was a doctor, police variety — 
definitely the police. 

Thadeus Jadiver sighed. “What 
am I in for?” 

“You’re not in for anything. 
Maybe you should be, but that’s 
not 'my business,” she said in a 
flat voice. That was the only 
thing about her that was flat; the 
rest curved nicely even under the 
uniform. “This is an emergency 
as well as a police hospital. We 
were close, so we took you in.” 
That was reassuring. Jadiver 
tried to smile as he lifted a cur- 
iously bandaged arm. “Thanks 
for this.” 

“I’ll take only half the credit. 
That was a combo job.” 

He was going to have difficulty 
if she insisted on using technical 
slang. “What’s a combo job?” 
“Just what it sounds like. A 
combination robot-human sur- 
geon. All hospitals use them. The 
robot is more precise and delicate, 
but it lacks the final margin of 
judgment that’s supplied by the 
human. Two of us work together 
in critical cases.” 

He still couldn’t remember 
what had happened, but it would 
come back in time. “I was crit- 
ical?”

Her mouth was firm and her 
cheekbones a trifle too broad. Just 
the same, the total effect was 
pleasing, would have been more 
so with a little warmth stirred in. 
“To give you an idea, you’ll no- 
tice that every square inch of 
your skin is now synthetic.” She 
leaned over and took his hand, 
which was encased in a light 
spongy cocoon. Expertly, she 
peeled back the end and exposed 
the tips of his fingers. 

Jadiver looked, then turned 
away. “Cellophane,” he said. “A 
man can be born, live, die, and 
be shoveled away; begot and be- 
get, completely untouched by 
human hands.” 

She looked blank at the men- 
tion of cellophane. Probably 
didn’t know what it was, thought 
Jadiver. So few people did any 
more. 

“Don’t worry about it,” she 
said. “Your skin’s transparent 
now, but in a few days it will be 
normal.” 

“That’s nice,” said Jadiver. “I 
suppose it would be educational, 
but I’d just as soon not be an 
anatomy model of the first layer 
of the human body.” 

She stood up and managed to 
work up a creditable imitation of 
interest. “We had to peel off the 
burned part, and when you were 
completely raw, we fitted the syn- 
thetic skin to your body. Over 
that we sprayed the bandage. 



New body cells form with this 
synthetic substance as the mat- 
rix. You’ll gradually return to 
normal or better. Your new skin 
may be more resistant to corro- 
sive chemicals and microbe inva- 
sions.” 

“Glad to hear it,” said Jadiver. 
“Superman.” 

For the first time, she smiled. 
“Don’t count on it. This stuff is 
too new for us to know how it 
reacts in all cases.” She turned 
around at the door. “In a few 
days I’ll take off the bandages 
and you can go home. Mean- 
while, you know what to do if 
you need anything.” 

J ADIVER lay there after she 
left, thinking. He hadn’t asked 
what the accident was and she 
had assumed he remembered. He 
ought to, but he didn’t. He frown- 
ed and tried to recall the last 
thing he had been doing. 

They had removed his skin and 
replaced it with a synthetic sub- 
stance. Why? Take it from there 
and work back. 

He stirred uneasily. The last 
he remembered, he’d been in his 
apartment. That didn’t help 
much; he was often there. He 
shook his head. He was in the 
apartment, preparing to leave. 
That meant he must have used 
the autobath. That was it. The 
picture came into focus: 

He touched the door of the 



TANGLE HOLD

autobath and it swung open. He 
went inside. “Shave, massage, 
bath," he ordered. 

The mechanism reached out of 
the wall to enfold him. He leaned 
back. It gripped him, not com- 
fortably, as usual — but tightly. 
He squirmed, but when the grip 
didn’t adjust, he relaxed. 

The autobath rumbled famil- 
iarly and a jet of water spouted 
up from the floor. It was icy cold 
and Jadiver shivered. 

“You didn’t listen,” he said 
firmly. “I asked for the bath 
last.” 

The autobath paid no atten- 
tion. The top and side jets turned 
on. The force was greater than he 
had ever experienced. It was dif- 
ficult to breathe. The water got 
hotter rapidly, and then, seconds 
later, steam blew out of the noz- 
zles. 

Jadiver shouted and tried to 
struggle free. The autobath did 
not let go. Instead, it ground at 
his muscles with hard inflexible 
hands. Here and there his skin 
began parting from his flesh. The 
autobath kept on kneading him. 
It was when it reached for his 
face — Jadiver remembered very 
clearly — he lost consciousness. 

He lay on the bed in the hos- 
pital, sweat soaking into the ban- 
dages. He could understand why 
he’d had a memory block — being 
boiled alive was frightful enough 
for his mind to repress. 



It was not only the accident 
that was disturbing, but the man- 
ner in which it occurred. He knew 
robot machinery and the princi- 
ples used in the construction of 
it. The autobath was one of the 
best — foolproof, if there was such 
a mechanism. 

Someone had tampered with it 
— object: to try to kill him. 

That was one possibility and 
he could face it with equanimity. 

There was also another, but he 
didn’t like to think about that. 

TTE looked out over Venicity. 

From his apartment, the to- 
pography resembled that of a 
lunar crater. In the middle was 
a giant concrete plain, the rocket- 
port. From the edges of the rock- 
etport, the size of the buildings 
increased gradually: at a third of 
the distance from the center, they 
were at maximum height; there- 
after, they decreased gradually 
until one and two story structures 
nibbled at the surrounding forest. 

Five million people and in ten 
years there would undoubtedly be 
seven, a sizable metropolis even 
for Earth. That didn’t mean that 
the population of Venus could 
compare with the home planet. 
Venus was settled differently. 
Newcomers started with the cities; 
only later did they venture out 
into the vast wild lands. Venus 
was civilized, after a fashion, but 
it wasn’t a copy of Earth.

The screen glimmered at his 
back. “Thadeus Jadiver, consult- 
ing engineer?” 

He turned. “That’s right. Can 
I help you?” 

The man on the screen closed 
one eye slowly and opened it 
again the same way. “This is 
Vicon Burlingame. I’ve been do- 
ing some experimenting and am 
now at the point where I can use 
some technical assistance.” 

“I’m not sure. I’ve been in the 
hospital until this morning. I 
think I need a checkup.” 

“I called while you were gone,” 
said Burlingame. “I know about 
the hospital; however, I don’t 
think my work will be strenuous. 
Perhaps you’d come over and 
we’ll discuss it.” 

“I'll take the chance I can help 
you.” 

“Good.” Vicon Burlingame 
gave him the address before fad- 
ing out of the screen. 

Jadiver dressed slowly. Weak, 
but better than he expected. 
Physically, his -recovery was far 
advanced. It wasn’t he who was 
taking a chance, of course; it 
was Burlingame. Jadiver had 
warned him and if Burlingame 
was willing to risk it, that was up 
to him. 

Before he left, Jadiver checked 
his office. A few calls in the last 
week, but nothing important. It 
was a routine check and he gave 
the robot routine instructions. 



A tiny thing, that office, lo- 
cated on the ground floor of a 
building fronting a principal 
thoroughfare. A space large 
enough for a client to sit down, 
if one should come, which wasn’t 
often. Behind the desk was the 
upper half of a robot. Tiny 
though the office was, it was not 
inexpensive, and the business 
that passed through it was barely 
enough to pay the rent. 

There were other advantages in 
maintaining it, though. As long 
as he had a business address, he 
was spared certain legal embar- 
rassments. 

TjMVE minutes later, he was 
greeted by Vicon Burlingame. 
“Come in.” Jadiver did so. 

Burlingame silently studied 
Jadiver closely. “Maybe you’re 
tired,” he said at last. “A little 
sun would relax you.” 

“It might,” agreed Jadiver. 
“This cloudy Venus.” 

“It’s not so bad when you’re 
home,” said Burlingame. “But 
public places are bad for ultra- 
violet.” He indicated the next 
room. “The lamp is in there.” 
Jadiver went in and began to 
remove his clothing. Before he 
finished, a little man came in, 
nodding silently at Jadiver. With- 
out comment, Jadiver stood in 
front of the machine. While the 
little man methodically examined 
him, his clothing disappeared.

The little man looked up at the 
end of the intensive investigation. 
“You’ll do,” he said. 

“Clear?” asked Jadiver. 

“Clear as the atmosphere of 
the Moon. We were afraid they’d 
planted you while you were in 
the hospital, but we decided to 
take the chance.” 

For the first time since the ac- 
cident, Jadiver felt relaxed. 
“Thanks, Cobber. I was hoping 
to contact someone to check it 
for me.” 

Cobber shrugged. “Who can 
you trust? If you go to a doctor 
good enough to find a gadget that 
small, what is he? A high-power- 
ed professional and he’s got his 
problems. He sees something in- 
side and smiles and says you’re 
fine and charges you a fat fee. 
Even if he tells you that you’ve 
been planted, there’s nothing you 
can do. No one’s going to cut it 
out — not while the police can 
hear everything through it.” 
“Thanksfortaking the chance.” 
Burlingame came in smiling 
confidently. “Now we can talk,” 
he said. Behind him were three 
other men Jadiver had never 
seen. 

“Where are my clothes?” Jadi- 
ver wanted to know. 

“They’ll be ready,” promised 
Burlingame, “The police have got 
all kinds of cute tricks, only we 
don’t fall for them. We’re syste- 
matic.” 



They were that, decided Jadi- 
ver, and something more. They 
had to be to survive so long. Bur- 
lingame was good. 

A gamin’s face peered through 
the doorway and one hand thrust 
his clothing into the room and 
waved it. “Here. They didn’t try 
to conceal anything.” She sound- 
ed disappointed. 

Jadiver dressed as Burlingame 
relayed the clothing to him. The 
gamin wrinkled her nose and 
disappeared. By the time Jadiver 
was completely dressed, she came 
back with refreshments. 

They sat down at the table. “I 
want faces,” said Burlingame, 
across from him — “five faces.” 

Jadiver looked around. There 
were six. “None of my business, 
except in a professional way, but 
who do I leave out?” 

“Cobber. We have other plans 
for him.” 

It wasn’t a good idea to pry. 
He had to know the human mate- 
rial on which he was expected to 
work, but it was safer not to 
know what they were planning. 

He tapped his glass. “What 
kind of faces? Soft faces, hard 
faces, space faces? And do you 
want anything else?” 

“Society faces,” said Burlin- 
game, “Emily wants to wear a 
low-cut gown. The rest of us just 
need faces.” 

“Real low,” the gamin insisted, 
wriggling.

“Society,” mused Jadiver. “I 
always did think it was better to 
rob the rich . like Robin Hood.” 

“Sure,” Burlingame said. 

Jadiver tilted the glass. “Espe- 
cially since the poor don’t have 
much money.” 

“That has something to do 
with it,” Burlingame cheerfully 
agreed. 

Cobber broke in. He was a 
little gnarled man, older than the 
others. “A point, Jadiver. The 
poor don't have much money, 
but there’s so many more of them. 
You can actually be more suc- 
cessful robbing them. But you 
have to keep at it every day in 
the year, and then you don’t call 
it robbery; you say you’re gov- 
erning them.” 

“Don’t have that kind of stam- 
ina,” said Burlingame. 

“A good point, Cobber.” Jadi- 
ver leaned on the table. “I don’t 
want specific information, but 
how can you make robbery pay 
off these days?” 

TJURLINGAME looked at him 
astutely. “Considering it 
yourself?” 

Jadiver shook his head. “In- 
tellectual curiosity. I’m doing all 
right in my own line.” 

“It’s a theory,” said Burlin- 
game. “You can’t touch banks or 
financial institutions. Too many 
electronic safeguards, robots, and 
what have you. In order to get 



past that kind of equipment, you 
have to be a top-notch scientist 
— and one that can do better at 
a top-notch job. 

“Now, who’s got money? The 
rich, and they want to show it 
off wherever they go. Naturally 
they take precautions, too, but 
people are always involved and 
that’s the weakness. You can 
build a machine that does one 
thing perfectly, but people make 
mistakes — they get rattled. Team- 
work can take advantage of it. A 
feint here, and a block there, and 
before anyone knows what’s hap- 
pening, we’re through their de- 
fenses. With, of course, their 
money.” 

Jadiver looked at him, at his 
handsome, ruddy, respectable 
face. “You played football?” 
Burlingame grinned. “Twenty- 
five years ago.” 

“It’s changed. You wouldn’t 
recognize it now.” 

“Perhaps not. But the princi- 
ple is still the same, and it’s the 
principle that pays off.” 

Jadiver stood up. “I’d better 
get started. Where do I work?” 
“Here,” said Burlingame. “We 
have the tools ready for you.” 
“Mind if I look at the setup?” 
“Go ahead.” 

The gamin bounced up and 
took charge of Jadiver, leading 
him to a small workshop screen- 
ed off in a comer of one of the 
larger rooms. The layout was 



TANGLE HOLD 



11 



authentic enough to justify the 
equipment — a few robot forms in 
the rough state, handbooks on de- 
sign, several robot heads in var- 
ious stages of completion, and an 
assortment of the specialized tools 
of the trade. It was standard for 
the tinkerer, for the would-be 
designer of robot bodies. Bur- 
lingame always covered himself 
in every detail. 

Jadiver inspected it thorough- 
ly, the gamin standing impatient- 
ly at his side. 

“I’m first when you’re ready,” 
she said. 

He eyed her amusedly. “What’s 
the hurry?” 

“There’s more to do on me 
and you’ll do your best work 
when you’re not tired.” 

“I’ll start soon. Let me see the 
plastic.” 

S HE opened a cabinet and there 
it was. Jadiver squatted and 
read the instructions on the con- 
tainers. He shook his head in des- 
pair. Every amateur always did 
this. 

He stood up. “You’ve got the 
worst kind,” he said. 

She shrugged. “They told me it 
was the best.” 

“That depends. There are two 
kinds, and this one does look 
more real than the other. In fact, 
for a time this actually becomes 
a part of your body, a pseudo- 
flesh. But it’s quite dangerous.” 



“The other kind is just a cos- 
metic, isn’t it?” 

“That’s right, but — ” 

“Then I’m not worried,” she 
said, tossing her head. “The way 
I see it, it’s dangerous not to use 
the best disguise we can get.” 

She might be right. At least 
he’d warned her, and as long as 
she had the facts straight, the 
decision was hers to make. 

Jadiver peeled off his jacket 
and slid into a protective smock. 
“Ask Burlingame to come . in. 
This is going to be delicate, you 
know.” 

The gamin grinned. “I’ve never 
been overly concerned about Vi- 
con, and he knows I can take care 
of myself.” She stepped behind a, 
screen and presently came out 
again, nude. “Where do you want 
me to stand?” 

“On the pedestal, under the 
light.” He looked at her closely. 
He had thought she was a little 
girl, a tired little girl who hadn’t 
slept much recently. It was the 
pert face that had fooled him, 
with the upturned nose, because 
she wasn’t young. Forty he would 
say, maybe more, nearly as old as 
Burlingame. 

Her body was slight, but not 
much was wrong with it. Here 
and there were a few wrinkles, 
though in general her figure ap- 
peared youthful. It would require 
all his skill to make her as spec- 
tacular in a low-cut gown as she 



12

wanted to be. And her legs, though 
well shaped, were slightly bowed, 
a sure sign of Venusian rickets. 
Early settlers hadn’t realized that 
the soil was deficient in some es- 
sential trace elements. 

He would have to straighten 
her legs if she expected to mingle 
with society. It was beyond his 
power to change the bones, but 
he could add pseudo-flesh to give 
the same effect. 

He slipped on the mask, at- 
tached the various containers, 
thrust his hand into the glovelike 
control valve, and began to work. 

She winced involuntarily as the 
spray tingled against her body 
and adhered with constrictive 
force. He blocked out the areas 
he had to alter and then began to 
fill in and build up. 

“I don’t see it,” said Emily. “I 
know you must be good. That’s 
why Burlingame wanted you. But 
it seems to me this is out of your 
line.” 

He brought the spray up in a 
straight line along the edge of 
her shin. “How good I am is a 
matter of opinion. Mine and the 
places I’ve worked.” 

“What places, for instance?” 

"Mostly Earth.” 

“I’ve never been there,” she 
said wistfully. 

“You haven’t missed much.” 
He knew that, while he believed 
that with part of his mind, es- 
sentially he was wrong. As the 



spray was drying on her legs, he 
started filling out her breasts. 
“However, this isn’t as much out 
of my line as you think. Engin- 
eers specialize, you know. Mine’s 
industrial design. We don’t usual- 
ly monkey with the internal me- 
chanism of a machine, though 
we’re able to. Mostly, we design 
housings for the machines, robots 
as a rule.” 

He proceeded to her face and 
changed the upturned nose to a 
straight one. “The ideal external 
appearance of a machine ought 
to establish the function of that 
machine, and do so with the most 
efficient distribution of space and 
material.” 

TTE stood back and eyed the 
total effect. She was coming 
along. “The human body is a 
good design — for a human. It 
doesn’t belong on a robot. That, 
for most purposes, should be a 
squat container with three wheels 
or treads, with eyestalks and ten- 
tacles on top. I designed one like 
that, but it was never built. Ro- 
bots always look like beautiful 
girls or handsome men, and the 
mechanism is twice as clumsy as 
it should be, in order to fit in 
with that conception.” 

He squinted at the spray. “In 
other words, I design robot bodies 
and faces. Why should it be 
strange I can do the same with 
humans?”

The spray was neither a liquid 
nor a dustlike jet. She shivered 
under it. “Why don’t you like 
robots? I don’t see anything 
wrong with them. They’re so 
beautiful.” 

He laughed. “I’ll give you an 
idea. I got tired of the meaning- 
less perfection of the bodies I was 
turning out. Why shouldn’t the 
bodies be beautiful, considering 
how they’re made? Anyway, I 
put a pimple on one model. Not 
on her face. Her shoulder.” 

She extended her hands and he 
took off the fine wrinkles with a 
sweeping motion of the spray. 
“What happened?” 

“I had to start looking for an- 
other job. But somebody higher 
up began to think about what I’d 
done. Now, on Earth, all robots 
that model clothing have some 
perceptible skin defects. More 
lifelike, they say.” 

“Is that why you came to 
Venus?” 

“I’d been considering it for 
some time. It seemed to me that 
there ought to be a place for a 
good designer, even if I did have 
to work on robots.” He smiled 
wryly. “A lot of other engineers 
had the same idea.” 

“Too much competition?” 
“Sort of.” He grimaced. “My 
first job here was designing fe- 
male bodies for so-called social 
clubs.” 

“Oh, those,” she said scornfully. 



“It's legitimate on Venus. Any- 
way, I tried out that idea again. 
Customers didn’t like it. Said 
they could get women with blem- 
ishes any time. When they got a 
robot, they wanted perfection.” 
“Don’t blame them,” Emily 
said practically. She looked at 
him with sudden suspicion. “Don’t 
give me pimples.” 

“Not a one,” he assured her. 
“You’re flawless.” 

And she Was — with only one 
item missing. He flexed his fing- 
ers in the control glove and spray- 
ed on nipples. She was finished. 

He shucked off the mask and 
laid aside the spray gun. “Look 
at yourself.” 

She went to the mirror and 
turned in front of it. She smooth- 
ed her hands across her face and 
smiled with pleasure. “It feels 
like flesh.” 

“It is, almost. Tomorrow you’ll 
bleed there if you cut yourself.” 
She nodded. “Is that all?” 
“Except for instructions, yes.” 
She looked at him with curious 
shyness and hurriedly slipped 
into her clothing. She hadn’t 
minded nudity before, when she 
wasn’t as lovely as she wanted to 
be. What she didn’t know was 
that Jadiver liked her better as 
she had been. 

T^RESSED, she came back to 
him. “What are those instruc- 
tions?” 



14 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



He tore off two envelopes at- 
tached to the container. He 
checked the spray gun to deter- 
mine how much had been used. 

“Pseudo-flesh is highly poison- 
ous,” he said, handing her the 
envelopes. “The tablets in the 
white package neutralize the tox- 
ic effects. Take one every eight 
hours. And don’t forget to take 
it, unless you want to end up in 
convulsions on the floor.” 

“I’ll remember. When do I be- 
gin?” 

“In three hours. And now for 
some advice I know you don’t 
want. You can keep yourself as 
you are for two months. But 
you’ll be healthier if you get rid 
of the pseudo-flesh as soon as 
you can.” 

She looked longingly at the 
face in the mirror. “How do I do 
that?” 

“When you’re ready, take the 
tablets in the green package, one 
every hour until the pseudo-flesh 
is absorbed. After it’s gone, take 
three more at the same interval. 
The total time should be about 
thirteen hours.” She was not pay- 
ing attention. He eased between 
her and the mirror. “Get a com- 
plete checkup before you try this 
again. It takes years off your 
life.” 

“I know that. How many?” 

“I can’t say exactly. It’s a body, 
pseudo-flesh weight ratio, plus 
some other factors that no one 



knows anything about. I’d esti- 
mate that you’ll lose about three 
years for every two weeks you 
keep it.” 

“It’s worth it,” she said, gazing 
again into the mirror. She turned 
away in indecision. “I’ve always 
known Burlingame was mine, 
even if I wasn’t pretty. Now I’m 
not so sure, after this.” 

It wasn’t exactly Burlingame 
she was concerned with, thought 
Jadiver. For a while she was go- 
ing to be beautiful beyond her 
expectations. The irony was that 
almost any robot outshone her 
temporary beauty. She was jeal- 
ous of machines that had no 
awareness of how they looked. 

Jadiver straightened up. He 
hadn’t fully recovered from his 
accident and he was tired. And 
the artificial skin, no matter 
what they said, hadn’t been com- 
pletely integrated to his body. It 
itched. 

“Send the rest of them in, one 
at a time,” he said as she went 
out. 

It wasn’t going to take long, 
for which he was grateful. Now 
that he knew a spying device 
hadn’t been surgeried into him, 
there were certain aspects of the 
accident that demanded investi- 
gation. 

J ADIVER limped into the 
apartment. The chair unfold- 
ed and came to meet him as he

entered. He relaxed in the depths 
of it and called out for food. Soon 
he had eaten, and shortly after 
that he dozed. 

When he awakened, refreshed, 
he began the thinking he’d put off 
until now. The fee from Burlin- 
game was welcome. It was dan- 
gerous business, so Jadiver had 
charged accordingly. Now his ec- 
onomic problem was solved for 
about a month. 

In the hospital he had been 
sure of a motive for the accident. 
It had seemed simple enough : the 
police had planted a spying de- 
vice in him. However, since he 
had been examined thoroughly at 
Burlingame’s and nothing had 
been found, that theory broke 
down. 

There was still another possi- 
bility — someone had tried to kill 
him and had failed. If so, that 
put the police in the clear and he 
would have to look elsewhere. He 
might as well start there. 

He walked over to the autobath 
and began inspecting it. It wasn’t 
the one he’d been injured in. That 
had been removed and replaced 
by the management. It would 
have helped if he had been able 
to go over the original one. 

The new autobath was much 
like the old, a small unit that fit- 
ted decoratively into the scheme 
of the room, not much taller than 
an upright man, or longer than 
a man lying down. The mechan- 



ism itself, and there was plenty, 
was effectively sealed. Short of 
an atomic torch, there wasn’t any 
way to get into it. 

Jadiver pryed and poked, but 
learned nothing. In response to 
the human voice, it automatically 
provided all the services neces- 
sary to human cleanliness, but 
there was no direct way to check 
on the involved mechanism. 

H E finally called the firm that 
made it. The usual beautiful 
robot answered: “Living Rooms, 
Incorporated. Can I help you?” 
“Information,” he said. “Auto- 
bath unit.” 

“Sales? New or replacement?” 
“Service. I want to see about 
repairs.” 

“We have no repair depart- 
ment. Nothing ever wears out.” 
“Perhaps not, but it becomes 
defective and has to be replaced.” 
“Defective parts are a result of 
wear. Since nothing wears out, no 
repair is necessary.' Occasionally 
an autobath is damaged, but then 
it doesn’t work at all, even if the 
damage is slight. It has to be re- 
placed.” 

That was what he thought, but 
it was better to be sure. “This is 
hypothetical,” he said. “Suppose 
there was an accident in an auto- 
bath. Is there an alarm system 
which would indicate that some- 
thing was wrong?” 

The robot was smooth and pos- 



16 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



itive. “Your question is basically 
misleading, according to our sta- 
tistics. In eight hundred and forty 
one million plus installations, on 
all the inhabited planets of the 
Solar System, there has never 
been one accident. 

“The autobath is run by a 
small atomic motor and is not 
connected in any way to an out- 
side power source. There are 
plumbing connections, but these 
are not suitable for the transmis- 
sion of a signal. To answer your 
question specifically: There is no 
alarm system of any kind, local 
or general, nor is there any pro- 
vision for someone else to attach 
one." 

“Thanks," said Jadiver, and 
cut the screen. 

He was nearly certain now. One 
check remained. 

TIE flipped on a switch and 
walked out of the room to 
the hall and stood there listening. 
He could hear nothing. He came 
closer to the door and there was 
still no sound. He pressed his ear 
against the juncture of the door 
and jamb. Not the slightest noise. 

He winced when he opened the 
door. The music he had switched 
on was deafening. He hurried in- 
side and turned it off. He had 
known his apartment was sound- 
proofed. Just how good that 
soundproofing was, he hadn't test- 
ed until now. 



The so-called accident had 
happened in the autobath. The 
unit couldn’t signal that anything 
was wrong. No one passing in the 
hall could hear his yells. 

The evidence indicated that no 
accident could happen in the au- 
tobath — yet it had. 

Logically, he should have died 
in that accident that couldn’t 
happen — yet he hadn’t. 

What did they want? And was 
it the police? In the hospital he 
had been sure — certain, too, of 
what they were attempting. Now 
the facts wouldn’t fit. 

Tiredness came back, reinforced 
by doubt. His skin itched — prob- 
ably from nervous tension. He 
finally fell into an uneasy sleep 
with the help of a sedative. 

TN the morning, the itch was still 
there. He looked curiously at 
his skin; it appeared normal. It 
was definitely not transparent, 
hadn’t been even in the hospital 
when the bandages were removed. 
He’d had a glimpse of it in the 
original transparent stage only 
once, when the doctor had ex- 
posed the tips of his fingers. 

Briefly he wondered about it. 
Did it really itch that bad, or 
was it an unconscious excuse to 
see the doctor? She was a sullen, 
indifferent creature, but without 
doubt worth seeing again. He 
didn’t know her name, but he 
could find out easily enough. 



TANGLE HOLD

As if in answer to the silent 
question, his whole body twitch- 
ed violently. He raked his fingers 
across his forearm and the nails 
broke off. She was at least partly 
right in her predictions; his skin 
was considerably tougher than it 
had been, though nothing appear- 
ed different. 

He didn’t like communicating 
with the police, but he had little 
choice. He flipped on the screen 
and made a few inquiries. 

The name he wanted was Doc- 
tor Doumya Filone. She was off 
duty at present. However, if it 
was an emergency — ? His skin 
crawled and he decided it was 
just that and identified himself. 
There were a number of persons 
with whom he had contacts who 
wouldn’t approve his doing this, 
but they didn’t have to live in his 
skin. 

He dialed her quickly. He 
couldn’t place the number, but 
figured it was probably across 
town, in one of the newer districts. 
He didn’t fully remember what 
she was like until she appeared 
on the screen. With that face to 
put on a robot, he might make a 
fortune. That is, if he could cap- 
ture the expression as well as the 
features. 

“How’s the patient?” she ask- 
ed. Behind her briskness he 
thought he could detect a flicker 
of concern. 

“You can take back that skin 



you gave me,” he said. “It itches.” 

She frowned. “I told you it 
was very new. We aren’t able to 
anticipate all the reactions.” She 
paused. “However, it shouldn’t 
itch. By now it ought to be well 
integrated with your body and 
new cell growth should be occur- 
ring with the synthetic substance 
as the matrix.” 

“Thanks,” he said dryly. “That 
doesn’t explain how I feel.” 

Unperturbed, she looked down 
at a desk he could imagine, but 
could not see. She got up and 
walked out of the field of vision. 
She was gone for quite some 
time. 

A disturbing thought formed 
in his mind. Was she calling else- 
where for instructions? There was 
no reasofi why she should, yet 
the thought persisted. 

She came back. “Get a deter- 
gent. What kind doesn’t matter. 
Put it in the autobath and take a 
hot bath, plenty of lather. Soak 
in it for at least fifteen minutes.” 

TTER prescription was primi- 
tive in the extreme. Did she 
really expect it to be effective, or 
did she have something else in 
mind? 

“Do you think I’m going to 
trust myself to that machine?” 
he said. “I’ve got myself a little 
enamel basin. Had to steal it out 
of a museum.” 

Nothing was outwardly 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



changed, but she seemed slightly 
sympathetic. ‘‘I can understand 
how you feel, but you’ll have to 
get over it or go pioneering in the 
wild lands. As long as you’re in 
a city, you can’t rent, buy or 
build accommodations that have 
no autobath. Besides, I’ve been 
assured that the odds are against 
that happening again.” 

That was an understatement, 
if his information was correct. 
Actually, he had wanted her re- 
action, but it didn’t tell him a 
thing. 

“Feel better already,” he said. 

She nodded. “Suggestion at 
work. Take your bath now and 
call me tomorrow if it doesn’t 
work. Sooner, if you need to.” 
She cut their connection before 
he could answer. 

In addition to physical relief, 
he had hoped that she would let 
slip some information. She hadn’t 
done so. Of course, she might not 
know anything more than the 
purely medical aspects of the po- 
lice plan. If it was the police. 

He left the screen and checked 
the autobath for supplies. Satis- 
factory for the present. He re- 
moved his clothing, stepped 
inside, and followed her instruc- 
tions. A tub rose out of the floor, 
fllled with water, and the mechan- 
ism immersed him in it. Thick 
soapy suds billowed up and warm 
water laved his skin. The rub- 
bery hands of the autobath were 



soft and massaged him gently 
and expertly. 

He tried to relax. So far, he 
had suffered no irreparable harm. 
He tried to avoid the memory of 
his accident, but that was impos- 
sible. The one comfort was that 
his death was not the objective: 
He corrected himself- — not the 
immediate objective. 

Anyway, he’d been rescued and 
placed under good medical care. 
How the rescue had been effected 
was unknown, unless it had been 
included in the plan from the be- 
ginning. If so, he could assume 
that the autobath had been tam- 
pered with and fixed with a signal 
that would indicate when he was 
unconscious. 

“Fifteen minutes and ten sec- 
onds,” said the autobath. “Do 
you wish to remain longer?” 
“That’ll do,” he said. “The 
rinse, please.” 

He lay back and curled up his 
legs, stretching his arms while 
clear water flowed soothingly over 
him. In spite of his skepticism, 
this primitive prescription of 
Doumya Filone seemed to work. 
The itch had stopped completely; 
although his skin was now mot- 
tled. No scars; the hospital and 
Doumya Filone had done a good 
job. 

He scrutinized his skin care- 
fully. The marks were not actual- 
ly on his skin; they were beneath 
it. So faint as to be almost in- 



TANGLE HOLD 



19 



visible, it was nevertheless a dis- 
turbing manifestation. The marks 
gradually became more distinct. 
It looked like a shadowy web 
thrown over and pressed deep 
into his body. 

^THE autobath lifted him and 
he stood in front of the mirror. 
There was no mistake — a net- 
work spread over his body, arms, 
legs, face too ; perhaps on his head 
as well, though he couldn’t see 
that. His skin was not transpar- 
ent — it was translucent for a cer- 
tain depth. 

Disfigurement didn’t concern 
him. Even if the condition per- 
sisted, it wasn’t noticeable enough 
to constitute a handicap. It was 
not the superficial nervous sys- 
tem showing through, nor the 
capillary blood vessels. The web 
effect was strikingly regular, al- 
most mathematical in appearance. 

As he looked, the translucence 
faded and his skin switched to 
normal, the marks disappearing. 
That was the word, switched. He 
ought to be thankful for that, he 
supposed. Somehow he wasn’t. 

He was out of the autobath and 
half dressed before the realiza- 
tion came to him. He knew what 
the network was, the patterned 
marks beneath his skin. 

A circuit. 

A printed circuit, or, since it 
was imposed on flesh, possibly 
tattooed. 



A circuit. What did anyone use 
a circuit for? To compute, to 
gather data, to broadcast, to con- 
trol. How much of that applied 
to him, to the body it was con- 
cealed in? The first he could elim- 
inate. Not to compute. As for the 
rest, he was not certain. It seemed 
possible that everything could be 
included in the function of the 
network beneath his skin. He 
hadn’t been controlled up to now, 
but that didn’t mean control 
wasn’t there, quiescent, waiting 
for the proper time. However, it 
didn’t seem likely. Human men- 
tality was strong, and a reason- 
ably intact mind was difficult to 
take over. 

What else? To gather data and 
broadcast it. Of that he could be 
almost positive. The data came 
from his nervous system. He sus- 
pected where it was broadcast to 
— back to the police. 

How the circuit on his body 
gathered data was unknown. The 
markings appeared to parallel his 
central nervous system. It seemed 
reasonable that it operated by in- 
duction. 

That meant it involved chiefly 
tactile sensations, unless, of course, 
there were other factors he didn’t 
know about. He felt his forehead 
carefully, his temples, and his 
skull around his ears. Nothing, 
but that didn’t mean that in- 
finitesimal holes hadn’t been 
drilled through his skull and taps 



20 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



run to the optic and auditory 
nerves. 

It could be done and he 
wouldn’t know about it, couldn’t 
feel it. The broadcasting circuits 
could then be spread over his 
head, or, for that matter, over 
any part of his body. 

TF his suppositions were correct, 
then he was a living, walking 
broadcasting station. Everything 
he felt, saw or heard was relayed 
to some central mechanism which 
could interpret the signals. 

The police. 

Cobber had been looking for a 
spy mechanism, a mechanical de- 
vice in Jadiver’s body. He hadn’t 
found it, but it was there, almost 
impossible to locate. A surgeon 
might find it by performing an 
autopsy, but even then he would 
have to know what to look for. 

How Jadiver had been able to 
find it was a pure puzzle. Ob- 
viously, the police hadn’t been as 
thorough as they had meant to 
be. Their mechanism had some- 
how gone awry at precisely the 
time Jadiver was most conscious 
of his skin. Without the itch, he 
would never have noticed it. 

At least one thing was clear 
now — the purpose. He’d been 
boiled into unconsciousness, his 
skin removed, the circuit put in 
place, and then had the synthetic 
substance carefully fitted over 
his body. 



His tension increased, for he 
knew now that he had betrayed 
Burlingame without meaning to 
— but it was betrayal nonetheless. 
It wasn’t only a question of pro- 
fessional ethics; it was how long 
he would remain alive. Burlin- 
game’s survivors, if there were 
any, would have an excellent 
idea of who was responsible. 

This thing went with him 
wherever he went. Did it also 
sleep when he did? That wasn’t 
important, really. 

He had to try to warn Burlin- 
game. 

Even these thoughts might be 
a mistake. The police might know 
what he was thinking. This was 
one way to determine whether 
there was such a thing as me- 
chanically induced telepathy, but 
he couldn’t work up much en- 
thusiasm for the experiment. 

His own problem was essen- 
tially the same as if a mechanical 
spying device had been planted 
in him — with one difference. A 
mechanical part was a foreign 
object and could be cut out by 
any competent surgeon willing to 
risk police retaliation. But only 
those who had installed this com- 
plicated circuit would know how 
to take it out. 

T>URLINGAME didn’t answer. 

It was probably useless try- 
ing to trace him — he very likely 
had arranged to drop out of sight. 



TANGLE HOLD 



21 



He was good at that. The police 
hadn’t caught up with him in 
twenty years. 

There was Cobber. He’d be 
elsewhere, setting up a rendezvous 
to which Burlingame and the rest 
could return and hide while their 
faces and figures were absorbed 
into their normal bodies. Cobber 
would be even tougher to locate. 

The only place Burlingame 
could be found with any degree 
of certainty, Jadiver reasoned, 
would be at the scene of the rob- 
bery. Jadiver went to the screen 
and spent an intensive half hour 
in front of it. At the end of that 
time, he had narrowed it down to 
two society events, one of which 
would occur in a few hours. He 
made a decision to cover it and 
warn them, if he could. After 
that, it was up to Burlingame. 

Jadiver rubbed his chin; the 
stubble had to come off. He went 
to the autobath, but it wouldn’t 
open. A figure in bas-relief ap- 
peared on the door. The surface 
had been smooth an instant be- 
fore. 

“Sorry,” said the voice of the 
lifelike, semi-nude girl, “the 
autobath is out of certain sup- 
plies. It won’t function properly 
until these are replaced.” 

“Let’s have the list,” growled 
Jadiver. He was jumpy. 

The bas-relief figure extended 
a hand with a slip in it. “If I may 
suggest, these can be placed on 



perpetual order to avoid future 
inconvenience.” 

What the future held was un- 
known. It wasn’t likely to include 
a comfortable existence in a well- 
furnished apartment. “I’ll think 
about it,” he grunted. 

“If there’s any other way I can 
help you — ” 

“There isn’t,” said Jadiver. 

The door shivered and the fig- 
ure snapped back into the mem- 
ory plastic from which it was 
made. The surface was smooth 
again. 

TTE went to the screen and 
punched a code. The counter 
display flashed on and then was 
replaced by a handsome neuter 
face. That face studied him, as- 
certained his maximum suscep- 
tibility, and promptly faded. 

The next face was that of a 
robot harem girl. Sex sells, that 
was always the axiom. “Is there 
anything I can do for you?” she 
asked huskily. 

“Yes,” said Jadiver. “You can 
get off the screen and let me see 
some merchandise.” 

“We’re not allowed to do that.” 

Jadiver grumbled in defeat. “I 
want something for my whisk — ” 

“Just the thing,” she said en- 
thusiastically, reaching out of his 
field of vision. The hand came 
back with a package. “Tear off a 
capsule, crush it, and apply to 
your face. It removes whiskers 



22 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



permanently for two days, and 
leaves your face as soft and 
smooth as Martian down.” 

Jadiver shuddered. “I’d rather 
be a man than a bird. Do you 
have anything that leaves a face 
feeling like skin?” 

The robot harem girl stabbed 
out frantically, but nothing came 
to hand. She turned around and 
went off to search. Jadiver sighed 
with relief and started to scan the 
shelves. The robot returned be- 
fore he could make a selection. 

“We have nothing like that,” 
she said, crestfallen. “Asteroid 
alabaster or hydroponic grapes 
and several other things, but no 
whiskoff that will leave your face 
feeling like skin.” 

“Then order something that 
will,” said Jadiver. “Meanwhile 
I’ll settle for a face of hydroponic 
grapes. Two weeks supply will be 
enough.” 

The robot complied eagerly. 
“Anything else? Shampoo?” 
Jadiver looked at the list and 
nodded. 

“No need to open the bottle,” 
she rushed on. “Just place in the 
autobath dispenser and let the 
machine do the rest. The bottle 
will dissolve, adding to the secret 
ingredients. Foams in micro-sec- 
onds as proven by actual test, 
and when you’re through, only an 
expert can tell your hair from 
mink.” 

“Mink?” he repeated. “Don’t 



think I’d like it. What about rac- 
coon? I’ve always admired the 
legendary Daniel Boone, alone in 
the terrestrial wilderness with a 
single-shot rifle. Sure, make it 
raccoon.” 

“I know we have none of that.” 
The clerk was positive. 

“Then order it,” he snapped. 
“You don’t have to furnish the 
rifle, though.” 

She seemed confused. “There 
is a ten per cent extra charge for 
non-standard merchandise.” 

“All right. Just don’t stand 
there arguing.” 

When the clerk left the screen 
to place the order, Jadiver hastily 
selected what he wanted. He vali- 
dated the purchases and snapped 
off the screen. The merchandise 
arrived in a few minutes. 

He loaded it into the autobath. 
This time the door opened and 
the bas-relief figure didn’t appear 
on it. Within a half hour he was 
ready to leave. 

rpHE door was not a door. It 
was a mirror, three-dimen- 
sional. The difference to the eye 
was slight, but since he knew 
what to expect, it was not diffi- 
cult to detect. It was a legitimate 
piece of staging, but it cost plenty 
to maintain the illusion. A society 
event, he supposed, called for 
•such precautions. There must be 
more inside. 

He ignored the mirror and 



TANGLE HOLD

pressed a blank section of the 
wall directly opposite. The wall 
faded and a robot in an impress- 
ive black-and-white livery stared 
at him with the proper insolence. 

“Your invitation, sir.” 

“What?” he said tipsily. 

“Your invitation, sir.” The 
voice was louder and the inso- 
lence increased. If he asked again, 
the robot would very likely shove 
him out and close the door. Deli- 
cately adjusted and unhumanly 
strong, it was a bit too invariable 
in the behavior department to be 
consistently efficient. 

His knowledge of robots was 
more than fair. In a few seconds 
he sized up the model facing him. 
A thin slip fluttered from his 
hand to the floor. The robot bent 
over tp pick it up. At that instant 
Jadiver thrust a long, thin, dou- 
ble-tined fork deep into the back 
of the robot’s neck, probing for 
the right place. He found it. Time 
became static for the robot; it 
remained bent over and could not 
move. 

Jadiver rifled the pockets, re- 
moved all the invitations, glanced 
at them, found one that would do, 
and thrust the rest back. Shadows 
of figures passed across the field 
behind the robot. Could they see 
what Jadiver was doing? Prob- 
ably not; privacy was too highly 
regarded. Nevertheless, some peo- 
ple were coming down the corri- 
dor and they could see when and 



if they got close. Stepping back, 
he took away the double-tined 
fork and the robot straightened 
up. 

“You dropped something, sir,” 
said the robot, handing him the 
slip from the floor. 

“It was nothing,” said Jadiver, 
taking it. That was the best de- 
scription of what he had dropped. 
He extended the invitation he had 
just filched. 

The robot grasped the invita- 
tion and seemed unable to focus. 
It tried to examine the markings 
invisible to human eyes. It passed 
a trembling hand across a trou- 
bled forehead. 

“Didn’t you come in half an 
hour ago?” it asked in bewilder- 
ment. 

Someone had — the person to 
whom the invitation had been is- 
sued. The robot, of course, had 
remembered. 

“Nonsense,” said Jadiver sharp- 
ly. “Do you feel right? Are you 
sure of your equilibrium?” 

If it was sure, he had miscal- 
culated badly. Robots were so 
much more or less than humans. 
It should be possible to design a 
perfect robot, one that would 
realize all the potentialities of a 
mechanical personality. It had 
never been done; anthropomor- 
phic conceptions had always in- 
terfered. 

“Must be mistaken,” mumbled 
the robot, and swayed. It would 



24 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



collapse in twenty minutes. The 
robot pressed a button and the 
field behind him flickered off. 
Jadiver passed through it and the 
field fell back in place. 

TNSIDE, he looked around. The 
usual swank, or maybe more 
so. Impressive, if he cared to be 
impressed by it. At the moment 
he didn’t. He had to find Burlin- 
game or Emily. He had created 
the faces of the other three as 
well, but he had made them into 
handsome nonentities. Among so 
many others who resembled them, 
he doubted that he could recog- 
nize them. 

For an instant he thought he 
saw Emily and made his way 
through the crowd. When he got 
there, he saw his mistake. This 
girl’s flesh hadn’t been put on 
with a spray gun. 

Burlingame was after jewels, 
of course, to be carefully selected 
from two or three of the wealth- 
ier guests. He must also have 
currency in mind, something ne- 
gotiable for immediate use. He’d 
need cash to drop out of sight for 
a while. 

Time was growing short for a 
word with Burlingame, just one 
word, whispered or spelled out 
silently: “Police.” That was all 
Burlingame would need. 

Jadiver was weaponless, and 
aside from warning Burlingame, 
he couldn't help. Until now he’d 



steered clear of violence and il- 
legality. He’d known the use to 
which his disguises had been put, 
but that was the business of those 
who paid him. 

Now it was different. The po- 
lice had a line to him, direct. How 
much they knew was impossible 
to estimate. He could visualize a 
technician sitting in front of a 
screen, seeing everything that 
Jadiver saw. That, however, was 
a guess, for he didn’t actually 
know how the circuit beneath his 
skin functioned. Until he learned, 
he would have to continue guess- 
ing, and blunder accordingly. 

He made his way to the bal- 
cony that encircled half the huge 
high room. He didn’t know the 
entire layout or the habits of 
those who lived here, but it was 
reasonably certain that they kept 
a large amount of cash on hand 
and that it would be safeguarded 
in a room not accessible to all the 
guests. It might even be up here. 

The few people on the balcony 
were at the far end. He looked 
down on the milling guests. Still 
no sign of Burlingame or any of 
his crew. Jadiver had done his 
work too well. They were indis- 
tinguishable from the others. 

At that moment, the lights 
brightened glaringly. The guests 
looked less glamorous. Women 
bulged excessively, top-heavy, 
and the tanned faces of the men 
turned an unpleasant gray. 



TANGLE HOLD 



25 



Magically, uniforms appeared 
at every exit. 

“Attention,” a harsh voice rang 
out. “Please line up. There are 
criminals among you and we can 
identify them.” 

J ADIVER didn’t listen to the 
rest. His eyes were on the uni- 
formed men. Mercifully, they car- 
ried tangle guns. That much he 
was thankful for. Burlingame and 
his crew would be taken alive. 
They might not like what would 
happen later, but at least they 
would live. 

The tangle gun was the most 
effective and least lethal weapon 
ever conceived. It would bring 
down a butterfly at two hundred 
yards and hold it there, without 
crumpling a wing or disturbing 



the dustlike scales. It would do 
the same with a Venusian saurian 
or a Martian windbeast, either of 
which outbulked an elephant and 
outsavaged a tiger. 

It didn’t have to hit the target. 
With proximity fuses — and it was 
usually furnished that way — it 
was sufficient for the bullet to 
pass near. Jadiver drew a deep 
breath. No one was going to get 
killed because of him. Neverthe- 
less, his skin crawled. 

He gazed down at the guests 
lining up. They, too, knew what 
tangle guns were. 

Suddenly a man darted out of 
line and headed toward one of the 
exits. He collided with an officer 
and the policeman went down. A 
tangle gun snapped. The running 
man fell headlong. Three more 




26 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 




times the tangle gun fired at the 
man Writhing on the floor — at 
his hands, at his face, and again 
at his legs. 

The tangle gun propelled a 
plastic bullet, and that plastic 
was a paradox. It was the stick- 
iest substance known and would 
adhere to a sphere of polished 
platinum, tearing away the solid 
metal if it were forcibly removed 
without first being neutralized. It 
also extruded itself into fine, wire- 
like strands on a moving object. 
The more anything moved, the 
tighter it wrapped around. The 
victim was better off to relax. He 
couldn’t escape; no one ever had. 

Jadiver watched the man 
threshing on the floor. One shot 
would have been enough. Some- 
one on the Venicity force liked 
to see men squirm. 

As nearly as Jadiver could de- 
termine, the man on the floor was 
not Burlingame. The leader 
hadn’t been taken, but he didn’t 
have long to enjoy his freedom. 
The theory he had about team- 
work was tarnished now — a feint 
here and a block there — and they 
were all headed into the arms of 
the Venicity police. It couldn’t 
work against superior force, and 
an ambush set unwittingly by 
Jadiver. 

Then Jadiver saw them. They 
moved as a unit — Burlingame, 
Emily and two others. They 
smashed through the guests with 



27 



a formation that had the flying 
wedge as a remote ancestor. 
Burlingame was leading it, tangle 
gun in hand. The guests were 
thrown back and a policeman 
went down. 

It was hard to fire into the mob 
through which Burlingame and 
his crew were bulling. In that re- 
spect, the tangle gun was not 
selective. It seized on any motion. 

They couldn’t make it, but 
Jadiver hoped for them. They 
were at the edge of the crowd. 
Between them and freedom was a 
thin cordon of police. Beyond the 
police was a planted area where 
jungle vines and shrubs, consid- 
erably taller than a man, grew 
dense. Just past that area were 
two exits leading to the street. 

From the balcony, Jadiver 
could see it clearly. If they could 
reach the exits, they had a chance 
for flight. 

They broke through the cordon. 
They shouldn’t have, for superior 
trained men were opposing them. 
But it was another kind of train- 
ing that Burlingame was using 
and with it he split the police. 
The group plunged into the 
jungle shrubs and emerged on the 
other side. The police on the floor 
couldn’t see them, the planted 
area screened off the view. They 
were almost safe. 

The exits opened before they 
could reach them — more police. 
Burlingame went down, a cloud 



around his face, weaving wire 
shapes that tightened on his 
throat. The other two stumbled 
as police fired at their feet. 

T7MILY alone was not hit. She 
was close and moving too fast. 
She escaped the tangle guns, 
but ran directly into the arms 
of a burly officer. He laughed 
and grabbed her as if she were a 
robot. She bit him. • 

He swore at her and swift- 
ly looked around. The guests 
couldn’t see. He hit her solidly 
in the middle. She gasped for 
breath. He took out his tangle 
gun and fired into her mouth. 

Jadiver sicklily knew he had 
been wrong about the tangle gun ; 
it could kill if the person who 
used it had sufficient experience 
and brutality. 

Emily would never have to lose 
that beautiful face and figure. 
She could keep it until she died, 
which wouldn’t be long. Nobody 
could stop the peristaltic motion 
of the digestive system, voluntar- 
ily or otherwise, or of the lungs 
in trying to breathe. 

Burlingame wouldn’t know. 
Policemen were cooperative, and 
it would be listed as an accident. 

Jadiver closed his eyes. Emily 
was dying and no one could help 
her. Or himself, either, when 
they came to pick him up. They 
had to know exactly where he 
was. He waited, expecting a tap 



28 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



on the shoulder or the snap of 
the tangle gun. 

The lights dimmed and the 
same harsh voice spoke. “The 
danger is over, thanks to the effi- 
cient work of the Venicity police 
force. You are now safe.” 

Nothing like advertising your- 
self, thought Jadiver. 

No one came near him. Ap- 
parently the police didn’t want 
him yet — they expected him to do 
more for them. 

He went down the stairs and 
mingled with the excited guests. 
It had been a good show, unex- 
pected entertainment, especially 
since it hadn’t involved any real 
danger for them. He circulated 
through the chattering men and 
women until he came near the 
planted area. At an opportune 
moment, he slipped in. 

It was a miniature jungle; he 
was safe from ordinary detection 
as long as he stayed there.’ He 
went quietly through the vines 
and shrubs toward the other side. 
The broad back of a policemen 
loomed up in front of him. 

Jadiver was an industrial en- 
gineer, a specialist in the design 
of robot bodies and faces, robots 
that had to look like humans. 
He knew anatomy, not in the way 
a doctor did, but it was nonethe- 
less the knowledge of an expert. 
He reached out and the police- 
man toppled. 

He dragged the unconscious 



man deeper into the little jungle 
and listened. No one had noticed. 
Physically a large man, the po- 
liceman might be the one who 
had shot Emily — and then again 
he might not be. He did have a 
tangle gun, which was the im- 
portant thing. Jadiver took it and 
rifled the man’s pockets for am- 
munition. 

He knelt for a final check on 
the body. The chest rose and fell 
with slow regularity. For insur- 
ance, Jadiver again pressed the 
nerve. This man wouldn’t trouble 
anyone for a few hours. 

Jadiver looked out. When he 
was sure he wasn’t observed, he 
walked out and joined the guests. 
He moved politely from one 
group to another and in several 
minutes stood beside the door. He 
left the way he came. 

It was that simple. He had to 
assume that until events proved 
he was mistaken. 

O UTSIDE, he walked briskly. 

It was not late and the 
city overflowed with men and 
women walking, flying, skimming. 
Roughly dressed men down from 
the north polar farms, explor- 
ers from the temperate jungles, 
government girls — the jumbled 
swarm that comes to a planet in 
the intermediate stages of ex- 
ploitation. It was a background 
through which he could pass un- 
noticed. 



TANGLE HOLD 



29 



The circuit, though — always 
the circuit. He couldn’t escape 
that by walking away from it. 
But at least he’d proved that 
telepathy wasn’t possible by 
means of it, or he wouldn’t still 
be free. 

Other than that, he didn’t know 
how it operated. If it was purely 
electronic in nature, then it had 
a range. He might be able to get 
beyond that range, if he knew 
how far it extended. 

A lot depended on the power 
source. He hadn’t been able to 
check closely, hadn’t really 
known what he was looking at 
when he’d seen it in the auto- 
bath. He remembered that the 
circuit seemed to be laid over his 
own nervous system. Consider- 
ing the power available, the range 
was apt to be quite limited. 

That was pure supposition and 
might be wrong. There was noth- 
ing to preclude an external power 
source, say a closed field blanket- 
ing the city or even the entire 
planet. If so, it represented a tech- 
nical achievement beyond any- 
thing he was familiar with. That 
didn’t disprove it, of course. The 
circuit itself indicated a startling 
advance and he knew it existed. 

There was still another pos- 
sibility. The circuit might not be 
entirely electronic. It might op- 
erate with the same forces that 
existed inside a single nerve cell. 
If so, all bets were off ; there was 



no way he could determine the 
range. It might be anything at all, 
micro-inches or light-years. 

With unlimited equipment and 
all the time in the worlds, he 
could answer some of those ques- 
tions floating around in his 
mind. He had neither', but there 
were solutions he could make use 
of. Limited solutions, but it was 
better than waiting to be caught. 

Jadiver headed toward one 
such solution. 

The robot clerk looked up, 
smiling and patient, as he en- 
tered. It could afford to be pa- 
tient. There was no place it want- 
ed to be other than where it was 
at the moment. “Can I help you?” 
“Passage to Earth,” said Ja- 
diver. 

The clerk consulted the sched- 
ule. That was pretense. The 
schedule and not much else had 
been built into its brain. “There’s 
an orbit flight in two weeks.” 

In two weeks, Jadiver could be 
taken, tried, and converted ten 
times over. “Isn’t there anything 
sooner?” 

“There’s an all-powered flight 
leaving tomorrow, but that’s for 
Earth citizens only.” 

“Suits me. Book me for it.” 
“Be glad to,” said the robot. 
“Passport, please.” 

TT was going to cost more than 
just the fare, Jadiver knew. 
He would arrive on Earth with 



30 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



very little money and could ex- 
pect to start all over. He was no 
longer fresh out of training, will- 
ing to start at the bottom. He was 
a mature man, experienced be- 
yond the ordinary, and most or- 
ganizations he could work for 
would be suspicious of that. 

But it was worth it, aside from 
the escape. No future for him 
there, jammed in on a crowded 
world, but it was his planet, al- 
ways would be, and he wouldn’t 
mind going back. 

“Sorry,” said the clerk, flipping 
over the passport and studying it. 
“I can’t book you. The flight’s 
only for Earth citizens.” 

"I was bom there,” Jadiver 
impatiently said. “Can’t you see?” 
“You were?” asked the robot 
eagerly. “I was built there.” It 
handed him back the passport. 
“However, it doesn’t matter where 
you were born. You’ve been here 
three years without going back. 
Automatically, you became a 
citizen of Venus two and a half 
years ago.” 

Jadiver hadn’t known that. He 
doubted that many did. It was 
logical enough. Earth was over- 
flowing and the hidden citizen- 
ship clause was a good way of 
getting rid of the more restless 
part of the population and mak- 
ing sure they didn’t come back. 

“There’s still the orbit flight,” 
said the clerk, smiling and serene. 
“For that you need a visitor’s 



visa, which takes time. Shall I 
make the arrangements?” 

Aside from the time element, 
which was vital, he couldn’t tip 
the police off that he intended 
to leave. 

“Thanks,” he said, taking the 
passport. “I’ll call back When i 
make up my mind.” 

Down the street was another 
interplanetary flight office and he 
wandered into it. It might have 
been the same office he had just 
left, robot and all. 

“Information on Mars,” he 
said, his manner casual. 

The clerk didn’t bother to con- 
sult the schedule. There was a 
difference, after all. “There’ll be 
an orbit flight in four months,” 
it said pleasantly. “Rate, four- 
fifths of the standard fare to 
Earth.” 

Nothing was working out as ex- 
pected. “What about the moons 
of Jupiter?” This was the last 
chance. 

“Due to the position of the 
planets, for the next few months 
there are no direct flights any- 
where beyond Mars. You have 
to go there and transfer.” 

That escape was closed. “I 
can’t make plans so far in ad- 
vance.” 

The robot beamed at him. “I 
can see that you’re a gentleman 
who likes to travel.” It grew con- 
fidential and leaned over the 
counter. “I have a bargain here, 



TANGLE HOLD 



31 



truly the most sensational we’ve 
ever offered.” 

Jadiver drew away from that 
eagerness. “What is this bargain?” 
“Did you notice the fare to 
Mars? Four-fifths of that to 
Earth, and yet it’s farther away. 
Did you stop to think why?” 

TTE had noticed and he thought 
he knew why. It was another 
side of the citizenship program. 
Get them away from Earth, the 
farther the better, and don’t let 
them come back. If necessary, 
shuttle them between colonies, 
but don’t let them come back. 

“I hadn’t,” he said. “Why?” 
The voice throbbed throatily 
and robot eyes grew round. “To 
induce people to travel. Travel is 
wonderful. I love to travel.” 
Pathetic thing. Someone had 
erred in building it, had im- 
planted too much enthusiasm for 
the job. It loved to travel and 
would never get farther than a 
few feet from the counter. Jadiver 
dismissed that thought. 

“What’s this wonderful offer?” 
he asked. 

“Just think of it,” whispered 
the robot. “We have another 
destination, much farther than 
Jupiter, but only one-tenth the 
fare to Earth. If you don’t have 
the full fare in cash, just give 
us verbal assurance that you’ll 
pay when you get the money. No 
papers to sign. We have con- 



fidence in your personal integ- 
rity.” 

“Sounds intriguing,” Jadiver 
said, backing away. It sounded 
more like a death sentence. Alpha 
Centauri or some such place — 
hard grubbing labor under a blaz- 
ing or meager sun, it didn’t mat- 
ter which. Exile forever on planets 
that lagged and would always lag 
behind Earth. It took years to 
get there, even at speeds only a 
little below that of light, time in 
which the individual was out of 
touch. 

“I hope you won’t forget,” said 
the robot. “It’s hard to get people 
to understand. But I can see that 
you do.” 

He understood too well. He 
ducked out of the flight office. 
He’d stay and take it here if he 
had to, escape some way if he 
could. Nothing was worth that 
kind of sacrifice. 

He went slowly back to the 
apartment. It was not so strange 
that the police hadn’t arrested 
him. They knew that he’d stay on 
the planet, that he had to. They’d 
had it figured out long before he 
did. 

He fell into the bed without 
removing his clothing. The bed 
made no effort to induce him to 
sleep. It wasn’t necessary. 

IN the morning, Jadiver awak- 
ened to the smell of food. The 
room he slept in was dark, but in 



32 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the adjacent room he could hear 
the Kitch-Hen clucking away 
contentedly as it prepared break- 
fast. 

He rolled over and sat up. He 
was not alone. 

“Cobber?” he called. 

“Yeah,” said Cobber. He was 
very close, but Jadiver couldn’t 
see him. 

“The police got them,” Jadiver 
said, reaching for the tangle gun. 
It was gone. He’d expected that. 

“I heard. I was waiting for 
them and they didn’t come.” He 
was silent for a moment. “It had 
to be you, didn’t it?” 

“It was,” Jadiver said. “When 
I found out, I tried to tell them. 
But it was too late.” 

“Glad you tried,” said Cobber. 
At that instant, so was Jadiver. 
“I checked you myself. I couldn’t 
find anything,” Cobber added 
thoughtfully. “They must have 
something new.” 

“It is new,” Jadiver wearily 
confirmed. “I can’t get rid of it.” 
“Mind telling me? I figure I 
ought to know.” 

Hunched up in the darkness, 
Jadiver told him what he could. 
At present, he was defenseless. 
Cobber was a little man, but he 
was no stranger to violence and 
he had the weapons. Perhaps that 
was what the police counted on — 
that Cobber would save them an 
arrest. 

“Bad,” said Cobber after an 



interval. It sounded like a re- 
prieve. 

Jadiver waited. 

“I liked Burlingame,” con- 
tinued Cobber. “Emily, too.” 

Burlingame was a decent fel- 
low. Emily he had seen only 
once, twice if he counted last 
night. She deserved better than 
she got. 

“I don’t know who it was,” 
Jadiver said. “Some big police- 
man.” 

“I know a lot of people — I’ll 
find out,” Cobber promised. “I 
liked Emily.” 

It wouldn’t do any good, 
though Jadiver approved. For a 
while there’d be one less sadist 
on the force, and after that they’d 
hire another. 

“You’d better leave while you 
can,” said Jadiver. 

Cobber laughed. "I’ll get away. 
I know Venus and I don’t have a 
spy inside.” He got up, turned on 
the lights and tossed the tangle 
gun on the bed. “Here. You need 
this worse than I do.” 

Jadiver blinked gratefully and 
took it. Cobber believed him. If 
the police wanted to eliminate 
him, they’d have to come for him, 
after all. 

He stood up. “Breakfast?” 

“No breakfast,” said Cobber. 
“I’m going to take your advice 
and get out of here.” He went 
to the door, opened it a fraction 
and listened. Satisfied, he closed

it and turned - back to Jadiver. 
“Tell that cop I know a few 
tricks with a tangle gun he never 
heard of. I’ll show him what 
they are.” 

“I won’t see him, I hope.” 

“You don’t have to. They’re 
taking everything down. They’ll 
tell him. That is, I hope they do.” 

He slipped out the door and 
was gone. 

rpHE Kitch-Hen tired of wait- 
ing for Jadiver to come out. 
It cackled disgustedly and sent a 
table into his room. Mechanically 
he sat down and began to eat. 

Not only how far but also what 
kind of data did the circuit trans- 
mit? That was one unanswered 
problem. If he couldn’t outrun it, 
he might outthink it. 

First, the data was transmitted 
to the police with some degree 
of accuracy. They had been able 
to anticipate the robbery. Not 
completely, but they did know it 
was Burlingame and how many 
men he was using. They also 
knew the approximate date. From 
that, it was a matter of logic to 
determine what specific society 
event he was aiming at. Jadiver 
had been able to do the same. 

Thoughts, visual and auditory 
impressions, tactile and other sen- 
sory data — that was the sum of 
what the circuit could transmit, 
theoretically. 

He could almost positively rule 



out thoughts. It had never been 
proved that thoughts could be 
transferred from one person to 
another, mechanically or other- 
wise. But that was not his reason 
for rejecting it. If they could read 
his thoughts, it was useless for 
him to plan anything. And he 
was going to plan ahead, whether 
it was useless or not. 

Tactile sensations, temperature, 
roughness, and the like were un- 
important except to a scientist. 
He doubted that police were that 
scientifically interested in him. 
He could forget about the sense 
of touch. 

Sight and hearing. Neither of 
these could be eliminated at pres- 
ent. They could see what he saw, 
hear what he heard. As long as 
they could, escape was out of 
the question. It wouldn’t take 
much to betray him — a street sign 
glimpsed through his eyes, for 
instance, and they knew where he 
was. 

As long as they could see what 
he saw. 

But there was such a thing as a 
shield. Any known kind of radia- 
tion could be shielded against. 

He was working with intang- 
ibles. He didn’t know the nature 
of the phenomenon he had to 
fight. He had to extrapolate in 
part, guess the rest. One thing 
was certain, though: If he was 
successful in setting up a shield 
against the circuit, the police 



34 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



would arrive soon after. Arrive 
h$re. 

His value to them was obvious. 
Through him they could make an 
undetected contact with the shad- 
owy world of illegality. If that 
contact was cut off or if he 
seemed about to escape, his use- 
fulness came to an end and they 
would want one more arrest while 
they could get it. 

Once he started to work on the 
shield, he would have towork fast. 

Jadiver went to the screen. 
There could be "no hesitation; the 
decision was ready-made. 

The bank robot appeared on 
the screen and Jadiver spoke to 
him briefly, requesting that his 
account be cleared. He scribbled 
his signature and had it recorded. 

TVTHILE waiting, he began to 

** pack, sorting what he want- 
ed to take. It wasn’t much, some 
special clothing. His equipment, 
except for a few small tools, he 
had to leave. No matter. With 
luck, he could replace it; without 
luck, he wouldn’t need it. 

In a few minutes he was ready, 
but the money hadn’t arrived. 
He sat down and nervously 
scrawled on a scrap of paper. 
Presently the delivery chute clat- 
tered and the money was in it, 
crisp new bills neatly wrapped, 
the total of his savings over the 
years. He stuffed the money in 
his pocket. 



The scrap of paper was still 
in his hand. He started to throw 
it away, but his fingers were re- 
luctant to let it go. He stared 
curiously at the crumpled wad 
and on impulse smoothed it out,* 

There were words on it, though 
he hadn’t remembered writing 
any. The handwriting was shaky 
and stilted, as if he were afflicted 
with some nervous disease ; never- 
theless, it was unmistakably his 
own. 

There was a message on it, 
from himself to himself. No, not 
from himself. But it was intended 
that he read it. The note said : 

RUN, JADIVER. I’LL HELP. 

YOUR FRIEND 

He sat down. A picture rose 
involuntarily in his mind. The 
face was that of Doumya Filone. 

He couldn’t prove it, but it 
seemed certain that she was the 
one. She knew about the circuit, 
of course, had known long be- 
fore he did. He remembered the 
incident when his skin had itched. 

He had called her about it and 
she hadn’t seemed surprised. She 
had left the screen for some time 
— for what purpose? To adjust 
the mechanism, or have someone- 
else adjust it. The last, probably ; 
the mechanism was almost cer- 
tainly at the police end, and at 
the time he called she had been 
at home. In any event, the mech- 



TANGLE HOLD 



35 



anism had originally been set too 
strong and she had ordered the 
setting to be reduced. That sug- 
gested one thing: the power to 
activate the circuit came from 
the mechanism — a radarlike de- 
vice. 

Then what? His skin had mo- 
mentarily become translucent, al- 
lowing him to see the circuit. 
How she achieved that, he didn’t 
know, but the reason was obvious. 
It had been her way of warning 
him and it had worked. 

The message in his hand told 
him one thing. He had known 
about the danger, but he hadn’t 
guessed that he didn’t have to 
face it alone. Something else was 
evident: her control was limited 
— perhaps she could step in at a 
critical moment, but the greater 
part was up to him. 

He moved quickly. He opened 
the delivery chute and put in the 
small bag that held his clothing, 
then punched a code that dis- 
patched it to the transportation 
terminal. In return, he received 
a small plastic strip with the 
same code on it. The bag could 
be traced, but not without trouble, 
and he should be able to pick 
it up before then. At this stage he 
didn’t want to be encumbered. 

He took a last look around 
and stepped into the hall. He 
leaped back again. 

A heavy caliber slug crashed 
into the door. 



HPHAT had been meant to kill. 

He was lucky it hadn’t. 

Who was it? Not the police. By 
law they were restricted to tangle 
guns, though they sometimes for- 
got. In this case, their memory 
should be good — they’d have 
difficulty explaining away the 
holes in his body. Not that they’d 
have to, really; if they wanted, 
they could toss him into an alley 
and claim they had found his 
body later. 

Still, there was no particular 
reason why they should want to 
kill him outright when they could 
do it by degrees scientifically and 
with full legal protection. They 
didn’t call it killing. There was 
another term: converting. 

The converting process was not 
new; the principles had existed 
for centuries. The newness lay in 
the proper combination of old 
discoveries. Electric shock was 
one ingredient, a prolonged dras- 
tic application of it during the 
recreation of a situation that the 
victim had a weakness for. In 
the case of an adulterer, say, the 
scene was hypnotically arranged 
with the cooperation of a special 
robot that wouldn’t be short-cir- 
cuited. At the proper moment, 
electric shock was applied, re- 
peatedly. Rigorous and somewhat 
rough on the criminal’s wife, but 
the adulterer would be saddled 
all his life with an unconditional 
reflex. 



36 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



That was only one ingredient. 
There were others, among them 
a pseudo-religious brotherhood, 
membership in which was com- 
pulsory. C. C. — Confirmed Con- 
verters. They kept tab on one 
another with apocalyptic fervor. 
Transgressions were rare. Death 
came sooner. 

Jadiver stood there thinking. It 
wasn’t the police, because they 
had converting with which to 
threaten him. It wasn’t Cobber, 
either. He could have killed Ja- 
diver earlier and hadn’t. 

Cobber might have talked, 
though. There were enough peo- 
ple who now "regretted that Ja- 
diver had once given them new 
faces. As far as they were con- 
cerned Jadiver was in the hands 
of the police. 

The identity of the man out- 
side didn’t matter. He was not 
from the police, but he did want 
Jadiver dead. 

Jadiver stood back and pushed 
the door open. Another slug 
crashed into it, tiny, but with 
incredible velocity. 

He knelt, thrust his hand out- 
side the door near the bottom and 
fired a random fusillade down the 
corridor. Then he took his finger 
off the trigger and listened. There 
wasn’t a sound. The man had de- 
cided to be sensible. 

Jadiver stepped out. The man 
was crouched in an inconspicuous 
corner and he was going to stay 



in that position for a long time. 
He couldn’t help breathing, 
though, and his chest was a tangle 
of wires. There were some on 
his face, too, where his eyelids 
flickered and his mouth twitched. 

The gun was in his hand and 
it was aimed nearly right. There 
was nothing to prevent his squeez- 
ing the trigger — except the tangle 
extruded loosely over his hand. 
And he could move faster than 
it could. 6nce, at any rate. 

“I wouldn’t,” said Jadiver. 
“You’re going to have a hard 
time explaining that illegal fire- 
arm. And it’ll look worse if I’m 
here with my head wrapped 
around a hole that just fits the 
slug.” 

The man reaffirmed his original 
decision to be sensible about it 
by remaining motionless. Jadiver 
didn’t recognize him. Probably a 
hired assassin. 

The man paled with the effort 
not to move. He teetered and the 
tangle stuff coiled fractionally 
tighter. 

“Take care of yourself,” Ja- 
diver said, and left him there. 

J ADIVER headed toward the 
transportation terminal. The 
police could trace him that far. 
Let them; he intended that they 
should. It would confuse them 
more when he walked right off 
their instruments. 

Once inside the underground 



TANGLE HOLD 



37 



structure, he lost himself in the 
traffic. That was just in case he 
had been followed physically as 
well as by radiation. People com- 
ing from Earth, fewer going back. 
They arrived in swarms from the 
surface, overhead from the con- 
crete plain where rockets roared 
out on takeoff or hissed in for 
landing. Transportation shunted 
the mob in one direction for inter- 
planetary travel, in another for 
local air routes. 

Jadiver reclaimed his bag, 
boarded the moving belts and 
hopped on and off several times, 
again just in case. The last time 
off, he had coins ready. He 
slipped around a comer and 
walked down a long quiet cor- 
ridor. There were doors on either 
side, a double deck with a narrow 
balcony on the second story. At 
intervals, stairs led to the bal- 
cony. 

He walked a third of the way 
down the corridor, inserted coins 
in the slot, and a door opened. He 
went inside the sleep locker and 
the door closed behind, locking 
automatically. 

It was miserable accommoda- 
tion if he intended to sleep, but 
he didn’t. It was also a trap if 
the police were trailing him. He 
didn’t think they were — they were 
too certain of him. Nevertheless, 
the sleep locker had one advan- 
tage: it was all metal. Consider- 
ing the low power that probably 



went into the circuit, it should 
be a satisfactory temporary 
shield. 

He changed into clothes that 
looked ordinary — out of style, in 
fact, though that was not note- 
worthy in a solarwide economy — 
but the material, following a local 
terrestrial fad of a few years 
back, contained a high proportion 
of metallic fiber. That solved 
only part of the problem, of 
course. His hands and his head 
were uncovered. 

The pseudo-flesh that he had 
used on Emily was not for him. 
In a way, it was the best dis- 
guise, but he was playing this 
one to live, as much as he could, 
all the way. A standard semi- 
durable cosmetic would do; that 
is, it would when he finished alter- 
ing it to suit his purpose. 

The chief addition was a flaky 
metallic powder, lead. However 
the signal worked, radar or not, 
that should be effective in damp- 
ening the signal. He squeezed the 
mixture into a tube and attached 
the tube to a small gun which 
he plugged into a wall socket. 
Standing in front of the tiny 
mirror, with everything else 
cramped in the sleep locker, he 
went over his face and hands. He 
had trouble getting it on his scalp 
and under his hair, but it went on. 

He looked himself over. He 
now appeared older, respectable, 
but not successful, which fitted 



38 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



neatly into the greatest category 
on Venus — or anywhere, for that 
matter. He stuffed the clothing 
he’d worn back into the bag and 
walked out. He’d been in the 
sleep locker half an hour. 

He was operating blind, but it 
was all he could do. He had to 
assume that the metallic fiber in 
his clothing and the lead flakes 
in the cosmetic would scramble 
the circuit signal. If they didn’t, 
then he was completely without 
protection. 

He’d soon know how correctly 
he had analyzed the problem. 



TIE walked out of the trans- 
portation terminal and hailed 
an air cab which took him over 
the city and left him at the edge 
of a less reputable section. 

It was not an old slum — Ven- 
icity hadn’t endured long enough 
to have inherited slums; it built 
them quickly out of shoddy ma- 
terial and then tore them down 
again as the need for living space 
expanded outward. 

He checked in at a hotel neith- 
er more nor less disreputable 
than the rest. The structure made 
up in number of rooms what it 
lacked in size and appearance. 

This was the test period and 
he had to wait it out. If he passed, 
he was on an equal footing with 
any other person wanted by the 
police.' He’d take his chances on 
that, his wits against their or- 



ganization; he could disappear if 
he didn’t carry a beacon around 
with him. This was the best place 
to spend the interim period, 
crowded together with people 
coming and going to and from 
the wild lands of Venus. 

But if he didn’t pass the test — 

He refused to think about it. 

He walked aimlessly in the 
grayness of the Venusian day. 
Different people from those in 
the bright new sections of Ven- 
icity, quieter, grimmer, more be- 
wildered. Tough, but not the 
hardness of the criminal element. 
These people had no interest in 
either making or breaking the 
law. 

After nightfall, he loitered on 
the streets for a few hours, watch- 
ing faces. When policemen began 
appearing in greater numbers, he 
checked into his room. 

It was a grimy, unpleasant 
place. Considering the comfort it 
offered, the rate was exorbitant. 
Safety, however, if it did afford, 
and that was beyond price. He 
lay down, but couldn’t sleep. The 
room, apparently, was designed 
on the acoustical principle of an 
echo chamber or a drum. 

The adjacent room on one side 
was occupied by a man and wo- 
man. The woman, though, was 
not a woman. There was a certain 
pitch to the laughter that could 
come only from a robot. The 
management obviously offered at- 



TANGLE HOLD 



39 



tractions other than sleep. 

The room on the other side was 
quieter. Somebody coughed twice, 
somebody sniffled once. Two of 
them, decided Jadiver, a man and 
a woman, both human. They 
weren’t talking loud or much. He 
couldn’t hear the words, but the 
sounds weren’t gay. 

In the hall, other voices in- 
truded. Jadiver lay still. He could 
recognize the way of walking, the 
tone of voice. Cops. His test 
period wasn’t lasting as long as 
he’d hoped. 

"What good is it?” grumbled 
one, down the hall, but Jadiver 
could hear distinctly. “We had 
him dead center and now we’ve 
lost him. If I had my way, we’d 
have taken him sooner.” 

J ADIVER’S reasoning was not 
so pood if the police were this 
close. He got up and crept noise- 
lessly toward the door, fully dress- 
ed, as he had to be at all times if 
he expected to scramble the cir- 
cuit signal. 

The companion of the first po- 
liceman was more cheerful. “He’s 
not lost. We’ve just mislaid him. 
We know the direction he’s in. 
Follow the line and there he is 
at the end of it.” 

“Sounds good, but have we got 
him?” 

"We will.” 

That was the fallacy. He’d 
scrambled the signal, but he 



hadn’t eliminated it. He still 
showed up on the police instru- 
ment as a direction. He could 
imagine a technician sitting in 
front of a crazily wavering screen. 
The instrument could no longer 
pick up what he saw through his 
eyes, but it hadn’t lost him al- 
together. 

Jadiver clutched the tangle 
gun. 

“Better check where we are,” 
said the first* officer. 

“Going to,” answered the sec- 
ond. Jadiver couldn’t see. but he 
could visualize the pocket instru- 
ment. “This is Lieutenant Parder. 
How close are we?” 

The voice came back, almost 
inaudible. What he could hear, 
though, was disturbing. It sound- 
ed like someone he knew, but not 
Doumya Filone. “You’re off a 
hundred yards to your left,” said 
the voice. "Also, he’s a mile farth- 
er out. Either that or a hundred 
and fifty miles.” 

“He’s really moving,” said the 
lieutenant. “A hundred and fifty 
miles is in the middle of the 
swamp.” 

“I know that,” said the tan- 
talizing familiar voice. “I can't 
choose between outside and inside 
the city. If he’s inside, I want him 
to move. That motion, extended a 
hundred and fifty miles, by sim- 
ple mathematics will indicate a 
distance he couldn’t possibly 
travel in the jungle.” The voice 



40 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



paused. “We’ll send a party to 
check the swamp. You go to the 
point a mile farther on. We want 
him tonight. If we don’t get him, 
we’ll probably have to wait until 
tomorrow night.” 

“I’ll find him,” said the lieu- 
tenant. “Report when I get there.” 
Jadiver could hear footsteps 
receding down the hall. 

He breathed in relief. The 
makeshift shield hadn’t been a 
total failure. They knew the di- 
rection, but not the distance from 
some central location. The scram- 
ble had affected the strength of 
the signal and they couldn’t be 
sure. 

The impromptu visit told him 
this as well: there was only one 
instrument on him. With two, 
they could work a triangulation, 
regardless of the signal strength. 

He could hazard a guess as to 
why they had to get him at night. 
During the day, there were radio- 
logical disturbances originating 
in the atmosphere that made re- 
ception of the signals difficult. 
That meant that the day was 
safest for him. 

TTE went back to the bed and 
lay down, to puzzle over the 
familiar voice, to sleep if he 
could. Sleep didn’t come easily. 
The man and the female robot 
had left, but the quiet couple on 
the other side had been awakened 
by the noise in the hall. 



The woman sniffled. “I don’t 
care, Henry. We’re going back to 
Earth.” 

It was not an old voice, though 
he couldn’t be sure, not seeing 
her. Thirty-five, say. Jadiver re- 
sented the intrusion at a time 
like this. He was trying to sleep, 
or think, he wasn’t sure which. 

“Now, hon, we can’t,” Henry 
whispered back. “We’ve bought 
the land and nobody’s going to 
buy it back.” 

“We bought it when they told 
us there would be roses,” said 
the woman, loud and bitter. 
“Great big roses, so big that most 
of the plant grew below ground, 
only the flower showing. So big, 
no stem could support them.” 

“Well, hon — ” 

“Don’t hon me. There are roses, 
ten feet across, all over our land, 
just like they said.” Her voice 
rose higher. “Mud roses, that’s 
what they are. Stinking mud roses 
that collapse into a slimy hole in 
the ground.” 

She sniffled again. “Did you 
notice the pictures they showed 
us? People standing by the roses 
with their heads turned away. 
And you know why the pictures 
were like that? Because they 
didn’t dare show us the expres- 
sions on those people’s faces, 
that’s why.” 

“It’s not so bad,” said the man 
soothingly. “Maybe we can do 
something about it.” 



TANGLE HOLD 



41 



“What can we do? The roses 
poison cattle and dogs run away 
from the smell. And we’re hu- 
mans. We’re stronger, we’re sup- 
posed to take it.” 

“I’ve been thinking,” said Hen- 
ry quietly. “I could take a long 
pipe and run it at an angle to the 
roots. I could force concrete 
through the pipe and seal it off 
below ground. When it collapsed, 
the rose wouldn’t grow back.” 
The woman asked doubtfully, 
“Could you?” 

“I think so. Of course I’d have 
to experiment to get the right 
kind of concrete.” 

“But what would we do with 
the hole it left?” There was a 
faint tremor of hope. 

“We could haul away the 
slime,” he said. “It would stop 
smelling after a while. We might 
even be able to use it for fertil- 
izer.” 

“But there’s still the hole.” 

“It would fill with water after 
the next rain. We could raise 
ducks in it.” 

“White ducks?” 

“If you like.” 

IT^HE woman was silent. “If you 
think we can do it, then we’ll 
try,” she said. “We’ll go back to 
our farm and forget about Earth.” 
Henry was silent, too. “They’re 
kind of pretty, even if they do 
smell bad,” he said after a long 
interval. “Maybe I could pump a 



different kind of cement, real 
thin, directly into the stem. It 
might travel up into the flower 
instead of down.” 

“And make them into stone 
roses,” enthused the woman. 
“Mud roses into stone. I’d like 
that — a few of them — to remind 
us of what our farm was like 
when we came to it.” She wasn’t 
sniffling. 

They had their own problems, 
decided Jadiver, and their own 
solution, which, in their ignor- 
ance, might actually work. He’d 
been like that when he first came 
to Venus, expecting great things. 
With him it had been different. 
He was an engineer, not a farm- 
er, and he didn’t want to be a 
farmer. There was nothing on 
Venus for him. 

He couldn’t stay much longer 
on Venus in any capacity. Earth 
was out of the question. Mars? 
If he could escape capture in the 
months that followed and then 
manage to get passage on a ship. 
It wasn’t hopeless, but his chances 
weren’t high. 

The puzzling thing was why 
the police wanted him so badly. 
He was an accessory to a crime 
— several of them, in fact. But 
even if they regarded him as a 
criminal, they couldn’t consider 
him an important one. 

And yet they were staging a 
manhunt. He hated to think of 
the number of policemen looking 



42 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



for him. There must be a reason 
for it. 

He had a few days left, pos- 
sibly less. In that time, he would 
have to get off the planet or shed 
the circuit. Without drastic ex- 
tensive surgery, there was not 
much hope he could peel off the 
circuit. 

Unless — 

He had received a message 
from someone self-identified as 
a friend. And that friend knew 
about the circuit and claimed to 
be willing to help. 

He kept seeing gray eyes and 
a strong, sad, indifferent face, 
even in his sleep. 

TTE awakened later than he in- 
tended. Since daylight was 
safest for him, that was a serious 
error. He wasted no time in re- 
gret, but went immediately to 
the mirror. Under the makeup, 
his face was dirty and sweating. 
He didn’t dare to remove the 
disguise for an instant, since to 
do so would be to expose himself 
to the instrument. He sprayed on 
a new face, altering the facial 
characteristics as best he could. 
His clothing, too, had to stay on. 
He roughed it up a bit, adding a 
year’s wear to it. 

For what it was worth, he 
didn’t look quite the same as 
yesterday. Seedier and older. It 
was a process he couldn’t keep 
extending indefinitely. He would 



not have to, of course. One way 
or the other, it would be decided 
soon. 

He shredded the bag and his 
extra clothing, tossing them into 
the disposal chute. No use giving 
the police something to paw over, 
to deduce from it what they could. 
The tiny spray gun he kept, and 
the tube of makeup. He might 
need them once more. 

It was close to noon when he 
left the room. There were lots of 
people on the streets and only a 
few policemen. Again he had an 
advantage. 

He found a pay screen and be- 
gan the search. Doctor Doumya 
Filone wasn’t listed with the po- 
lice and that seemed strange. A 
moment’s reflection showed that 
it wasn’t. If she were officially 
connected, she might not show 
the sympathy she had. 

Neither was she listed on the 
staff of the emergency hospital in 
which he’d been a patient. He had 
a number through which he could 
reach her, but he resisted an im- 
pulse to use it. It was certain the 
police wouldn’t confine their ef- 
forts to the instrument check. 
They knew he had that number 
and they’d have someone on it, 
tracing everyone who called her. 

Noon passed and his stomach 
called attention to it. He hadn’t 
eaten since yesterday. He took a 
short break, ate hurriedly, and 
resumed the search. 



TANGLE HOLD 



43 



Doumya Filone was difficult to 
find. It was getting late and he 
had ascertained she wasn’t on the 
staff of any hospital not listed for 
private practice. 

He finally located her almost 
by accident. She had an office 
with Medical Research Incorpo- 
rated. That was the only thing 
registered under her name. 

Evening came early to Venus, 
as it always did under the mas- 
sive cloud formations. He got off 
the air cab a few blocks from his 
destination and walked the rest 
of the way. 

Inside the building, he paused 
in the lobby and found her of- 
fice. Luckily it was in a back 
wing. He wandered through the 
corridors, got lost once, and found 
the route again. The building was 
almost empty by this time. 

Her name was on the door. Dr. 
Doumya Filone. Research Neu- 
rological Systems, whatever that 
meant. There was a light in the 
office, a dim one. He eased the 
door open. It wasn’t locked, which 
meant, he hadn’t tripped an 
alarm. 

TYP one was inside. He looked 
^ around. There was another 
door in back. He walked over to 
it. It didn’t lead to a laboratory, 
as he expected. Instead, there 
were living quarters. A peculiar 
way to conduct research. 

The autobath was humming 



quietly. He sat down facing it and 
waited. She came out ,in a few 
minutes, hair disarranged, damp 
around her forehead. She didn’t 
see him at first. 

“Well,” she said coolly, star- 
ing at him. There was no question 
that she recognized him through 
the disguise. She slipped quickly 
into a robe that, whatever it did 
for her modesty, subtracted noth- 
ing from the view. He wished he 
was less tired and could appreci- 
ate it. 

She found a cigarette and 
lighted it. “You’re pretty good, 
you know.” 

“Yeah.” But not good enough, 
he thought. 

“Why are you here?” she ask- 
ed. She was nervous. 

“You know,” he said. She had 
promised him help once before. 
Now let her deliver. But she had 
to volunteer. 

“I know.” She looked down at 
her hands, long skilled hands. “I 
put in the circuit. But I didn’t 
choose you.” 

He began to understand part 
of it. The ‘Medical Research’ bus- 
iness was just a cover. The real 
work was done at the police 
emergency hospital. That was 
why she had no laboratory. And 
the raw material — 

“Who did choose me?” 

“The police. I have to tafce 
what they give me.” 

There were certain implications 



44 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



in that statement he didn’t like. 
“Have there been others?” 

“Two before you.” 

“What happened to them?” 
“They died.” 

He didn’t like where this was 
taking him. His hand slid toward 
the tangle gun in his pocket. 
“Maybe I should die, too.” 

She nodded. “That would be 
one solution.” She added harsh- 
ly: “They shouldn’t have taken 
you. Legally speaking, you’re not 
a criminal. But I couldn’t investi- 
gate you personally before I put 
the circuit in.” 

Why not? Was she an automa- 
ton, that reacted in response to a 
button? In a way she was, but 
the button was psychological. 

“That doesn’t help me,” he 
said tiredly. “The police wanted 
to catch Burlingame through me. 
That’s right, isn’t it?” 

She indicated that it was. 

“I did, without knowing what 
I was doing,” he went on. “Now 
I want out. Even if I cooperated 
with the cops, which I’m not go- 
ing to do, I’m of no further value 
to them. Every criminal on Venus 
knows about me by now.” 

“That’s part of it,” she said. 
“But there’s more. You’ve tied 
up the machine and neither I nor 
the police can use it.” 

T^XPLANATIONS were com- 
ing faster. It was no wonder 
the police wanted him badly. 



They had a perfect device to use 
against criminals, which was all 
they were concerned with, and 
they couldn’t use it as long as the 
circuit was in him. It made sense, 
but that kind of logic was deadly 
— for him. 

“I’ll face it,” he said. “I’ll take 
whatever charge they hang on 
me. It shouldn’t be more than a 
few years. You can use the time 
to take this damn thing out of 
me. Only I want a guarantee 
first.” 

She got up and stood with the 
light behind her. It was delib- 
erately intended to distract him. 
Under other circumstances, it 
would have. 

“If it were a small circuit, over 
just a fraction of your body, I 
could cut it out,” she said. “But 
the way it is, I can’t. It would 
kill you.” 

At least she was honest about 
it. And he still didn’t know what 
she meant when she had written, 
with his hands in the apartment, 
that she would help him. He 
would have to find out. 

“I can smash the machine,” he 
said. “That’s the other solution.” 

She leaned against the wall. 
“You can’t. And neither can I, 
though it’s technically my ma- 
chine. It’s in the police depart- 
ment with an armed guard 
around it at all times. Besides, the 
machine can defend itself.” 

He looked at her without un- 



TANGLE HOLD 



45 



derstanding. It didn’t sound right. 
He was sweating under the make- 
up and part of it was coming 
loose. 

“Then what did you mean 
when you said you’d help?” he 
asked. “You promised, but what 
can you do?” 

“I never promised to help.” It 
was her turn not to understand. 
Her hand slipped down and so 
did the robe. 

She was lying to him, had been 
lying all along. She never intend- 
ed to help, though she said she 
would. The purpose? To lead him 
into a trap. She’d been successful 
enough. He looked up in anger, 
in time to see an object hurtling 
from her hand. 

It struck him on the side of the 
head, hard. Some of the makeup 
chipped and fell off, but that was 
less important than yanking out 
the tangle gun. He fired twice, 
once at her feet and once at her 
shoulders. He had aimed at her 
head, but the shot went low. 

Her face was still pretty, though 
no longer indifferent or so strong. 
“What do you want?” she scream- 
ed. “Why don’t you leave me 
alone? I can’t help you. Nobody 
can.” 

She was standing there rigid, 
not daring to move. The robe 
rippled in a breeze from the vent 
and the tangle stuff gripped it 
and the fabric tore. She’d stand 
there a few more hours and then 



topple over. They’d find her in 
the morning and remove the 
tangle with the special tongs. 

As for himself, it was too late. 

He might have got off Venus at 
one time if he had concentrated 
on it. He hadn’t tried harder be- 
cause of Doumya Filone. He had 
wanted to believe her because — 
well, because. 

“I told you I’d help, Jadiver. 

I will.” The voice was distinct. 

It wasn’t Doumya Filone who’d 
said it. A tangle strand had work- 
ed up her throat and gripped her 
face. She couldn’t speak if she 
tried. Her gray eyes weren’t 
gray ; they were the color of „ 
tears. 

TTE looked around. It wasn’t 
-*■■■- Doumya Filone — and there 
wasn’t any other person in the 
room. 

“I’ve kept the police away,” 
said the familiar voice. “I can 
protect you for a while longer. 
There’s still time to save your- 
self. But you have to guess right. 
You can’t make any more mis- 
takes.” 

Strictly speaking, it wasn’t a 
voice. Doumya Filone didn’t hear 
it; that was obvious. It was the 
circuit then. Someone was mak- 
ing use of the machine to actuate 
the auditory nerve directly. That 
was what he seemed to hear. 

Jadiver was tired and his body 
grimy, muscles twitching under 



46 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION

the tension. But if his unknown 
friend — real, after all — could out- 
wit a room full of police and 
tinker with the mechanism which 
was supposed to spot him, he 
couldn’t do less. 

He grinned. “I’ll make it this 
time. I know what to do.” 

“The police haven’t given up,” 
said the voice. “I’m going to be 
busy with them. Don’t expect 
further communication from me.” 

He didn’t know who the person 
was, in spite of the haunting fa- 
miliarity of the voice. And he 
wasn’t going to find out soon. 
Probably never. It was enough, 
however, to know that he had a 
friend. 

He left Doumya Filone stand- 
ing there, which was a mistake, 
he realized as he reached the front 
office. He should have fired once 
more at her hands. The screen 
was crackling; her hands had 
been free and she’d managed to 
turn the screen on before the 
tangle strands interfered with her 
movement. 

He’d made a grave error, but 
not necessarily fatal. It would be 
some time before anyone got 
there. By then he hoped to be 
safe. 

He slipped through the corri- 
dors, went out the rear of the 
building and looked around for 
an air cab. The place was desert- 
ed at this hour and no cabs were 
in the nearby sky. 



He had to walk and he didn’t 
have that much time. He headed 
toward the nearest main thor- 
oughfare. It was in the opposite 
direction to his destination, but 
he should be able to find an air 
cab there. He was walking too 
fast, for a light flashed down on 
him. He wasn’t presentable and 
his haste was suspicious. 

“Stop,” said the amplified 
voice. It was probably just a 
routine check, but he couldn’t 
risk even that. 

He dodged into a space be- 
tween two buildings and began 
to run. In the center of town, 
this would be a blind alley, but 
in this section it wasn’t. There 
was a chance he could lose them. 
The buildings were just high 
enough so that they couldn’t use" 
the air car and they’d have to 
follow on foot. 

The patrol car alighted almost 
instantly and one of the police- 
men started after him. The man 
following him knew his business 
and was in good physical condi- 
tion, better than Jadiver was 
after days of tension and little 
sleep. 

Jadiver turned and snapped a 
half dozen shots at his pursuer. 
He was lucky, a couple were close 
enough. The policeman crashed 
to the ground and began to swear. 
His voice was choked off in 
seconds. 

The other one got out of the 



48 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



patrol car and let it stand. It 
was the principle of the thing: 
nobody did that to a policeman. 
Jadiver had a substantial lead 
and it was dark, but he didn’t 
know the route. Jadiver was 
enormously tired and this was 
the policeman’s regular beat. The 
gap between them closed rapidly. 

Out of breath and time and 
space to move around in, Jadiver 
took the wrong turn because the 
man was so close — and found 
himself boxed in. 

/CROUCHING, Jadiver fired at 
^ the oncoming man, a dark 
shape he sensed rather than saw. 
The tangle gun clicked futilely, 
out of ammunition. He fumbled 
hastily for a clip ; before he could 
reload, the policeman squeezed 
the trigger and held it down. 

The bullets didn’t hit him, they 
were set to detonate a fraction of 
an inch away. He gave up and 
awaited the constricting violence 
of the tangle strands. 

The bullets detonated and the 
strands flashed out, glowing 
slightly in the flarkness. They 
never touched him; instead, they 
bent into strange shapes and flip- 
ped away. The stickiest substance 
known, and one of the strongest, 
from which there was no escape, 
yet it would not adhere to him — 
was, in fact, forcefully repelled! 

It was that skin, of course, the 
synthetic substance they had put 



on him over the circuit. They 
should have tested it under these 
conditions. They might not have 
been so anxious to boil men alive. 

He felt that he was almost in- 
vincible. It was an exhilarating 
feeling. He stopped trying to re- 
load the tangle gun and stood 
up. He sprinted at the policeman, 
who stood his ground, firing 
frantically at a target he could 
not miss and yet did not hit. The 
tangle strands shattered all 
around the target. 

Jadiver swung the gun with his 
remaining strength; the butt con- 
nected with the policeman’s fore- 
head. 

Jadiver scooped up the dis- 
carded tangle gun and fired twice 
at close range, in case the man 
should decide to revive too soon, 
which was doubtful. He went 
back and entered the idling patrol 
car. He hadn’t lost much time, 
after all. 

He sat the car down on top of 
a building near the edge of the 
rocketport, straightened his cloth- 
ing and wiped the grime off his 
face. Some of the disguise went, 
too, but that no longer mattered 
much. 

He stepped out of the elevator 
and walked casually along the 
street until he came to the inter- 
planetary flight office. The same 
robot was there — would be there 
every hour, day and night, until 
the rocketport was expanded and

the building tom down and re- 
built, or the robot itself wore out 
and had to be replaced. 

The clerk looked up eagerly. 
“You’re back. I knew I could 
count on you.” 

“I’m interested in that flight 
you were telling me about,” said 
Jadiver. 

“We’ve changed rates,” the 
robot clerk replied, beaming. “It 
was a bargain before, but just 
listen to the revised offer. “We 
pay you, on a per diem basis — 
subjective, of course. When y^u 
arrive, you actually have a bank 
account waiting for you.” 

Per diem, subjective — the time 
that seemed to elapse when the 
rocket was traveling near the 
speed of light. It wasn’t as good 
as the robot made it sound. 

“Never mind that,” said Jadi- 
ver. “I’ll take it if it’s going far.” 

“Going far!” echoed the- clerk. 

A policeman sauntered by out- 
side, just looking, but that was 
enough. 

“I said I’d take it,” Jadiver 
repeated in a loud voice. 

The clerk deflated. “I wish I 
could go with you,” it explained 
wistfully. It reached under the 
counter and pulled out a perfora- 
ted tape. “This will get you on 
the ship, and it also constitutes 
the contract. Just present it at 
the other end and collect your 
money. You can send for your 
baggage after you’re on board.” 



Jadiver opened his mouth and 
then closed it. His baggage was 
intangible, mostly experience, not 
much of it pleasant. 

"I’ll do that,” he said. 

The clerk came out from be- 
hind the counter and watched 
Jadiver leave. Lights from the 
rocketport glittered in its robot 
eyes. 

J ADIVER paced about the ship. 

It was not enough to be on it, 
for the police could still trace 
him. And if they did, they could 
get him off. It was not only him- 
self, there was his unknown 
friend. They had ways to learn 
about that. 

He passed a vision port on his 
way through the ship. It was 
night, but it didn’t seem so on 
the vast, brightly lighted con- 
crete plain. A strange vehicle 
streaked across the surface of the 
rocketport in defiance of all regu- 
lations and common sense. 

It was coming his way. It 
dodged in and out of rockets 
landing and taking off, escaping 
blazing destruction with last 
minute, intricate maneuvers. The 
driver had complete control of 
the vehicle and was fantastically 
skillful. 

It was a strange machine. Jadi- 
ver had never seen anything 
quite like it. As far as he knew, it 
resembled nothing the police used. 
It didn’t halt outside the ship. 



50 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The loading ramp was down and 
the machine came up without 
hesitation. The entrance was too 
narrow and the vehicle would 
never get through — that seemed 
evident. An instant later, he was 
not so sure. The ship quivered 
and groaned and vibrations ran 
throughout the structure. 

He leaned over the railing and 
looked down. The 'machine was 
inside, dented and scraped. 

"Captain,” bellowed a voice 
from the vehicle. It was an au- 
thoritative voice and it puzzled 
Jadiver. 

The captain came running, 
either in response to the com- 
mand or to find out how much 
damage had been done in the 
crash and why. 

“Take off, Captain,” said the 
voice. "Take off at once.” 

The captain sputtered. "I give 
orders here. I’ll take off when I 
get ready.” 

"You’re ready when the ship 
reaches a certain mass. As soon 
as I came on board, you attained 
it. Check your mass gauges, Cap- 
tain.” 

The captain hurried to the 
gauges and glanced at them. He 
stared back at the machine. 

“Captain,” purred the machine, 
"you have a little daughter. By 
the time you get back, she will 
be grown and will have children 
of her own. The sooner you leave, 
the sooner you will see her again. 



I will regard it as a personal fav- 
or if you see that we take off im- 
mediately.” 

The captain looked at the ma- 
chine. Tentacles and eye stalks 
rose up out of the tip as he 
watched. It was a big machine, 
well put together, and it appeared 
quite capable of handling a room- 
ful of armed men. As a matter of 
fact, it just had. 

The captain shrugged and gave 
the order to lift ship. 

TT was none too soon. Out of 
the visionport, Jadiver could 
see uniformed men edging up 
from the underground shelters. 
They backed out of sight when 
the rockets began to flame. 

Faster the ship rose and higher. 
They were in the dense clouds 
and then through them, out in 
the clear black of space, away 
from Venus. 

Jadiver looked down at the 
machine. It wasn’t a vehicle. It 
was a robot, and it was familiar. 

"It ought to be familiar,” said 
the robot softly. That voice was 
for him alone, directly on the 
auditory nerve. "You designed 
most of it back on Earth, remem- 
ber?” 

He remembered. It was not a 
pretty imitation of a human — it 
was his perfect robot. And it was 
also his unknown friend, the one 
who had watched over him. 

He walked slowly down the 



TANGLE HOLD 



51 



stairs and stood beside it. 

The robot switched to the regu- 
lar speaking voice. “They built 
your design, after all. They need- 
ed a big and powerful mobile 
robot, one that could house, in 
addition to the regular functions, 
an extensive and delicate mech- 
anism.” 

That was the voice that had 
haunted him so long and in so 
many situations. It was not Jadi- 
ver’s own voice, but it resembled 
his. A third person might not 
recognize the difference. 

“That other mechanism,” said 
Jadiver. “Is that the one that 
monitors the circuit in my body?” 

“That parallels the circuit in 
your body.” Tentacles were busy 
straightening out the dents. 
“When I was built, they gave me 
a good mind, better than your 
own in certain respects. What I 
lacked was sensory perception. 
Eyes and ears, to be sure, good 
ones in a way, but without the 
delicate shadings a human has, 
particularly tactile interpreta- 
tions. I didn’t need better, they 
thought, because my function was 
to observe and report on the par- 
allel circuit I mentioned. 

“In the beginning, that circuit 
was a formless matrix and only 
faintly resembled your nervous 
system. As nerve data was ex- 
changed back and forth, it began 
to resemble you more and more, 
especially your mind. Now, for 



practical purposes, it is you and 
I can look into it at will.” 

Jadiver stirred uneasily. 

“Don’t you understand?” ask- 
ed the robot. “My mind isn’t 
yours, and vice versa. But we do 
have one thing in common, a 
synthetic nervous system which, 
if you were killed, would begin 
to disintegrate slowly and pain- 
fully. And now that it’s developed 
as much as it is, I would probably 
die, too, since that synthetic 
nervous system is an otherwise 
unused part of my brain.” 

“There were two other victims 
before me,” said Jadiver. 

“There were, but they were 
derelicts — dead, really, before the 
experiment got started. They 
lasted a few hours. I tried to 
help them, but it was too late. It 
was not pleasant for me.” 

lVTOT only was it a friend; it 
-*• ^ had a vital interest in keep- 
ing him alive. He could trust it, 
had to. After what had happened, 
doubt wasn’t called for. 

Jadiver rubbed his weary eyes. 
“That shield I used,” he said. 
“Did it work?” 

The robot laughed — Jadiver’s 
laughter. It had copied him in 
many ways. “It worked to your 
disadvantage. The circuit signals 
got through to me, but I couldn’t 
send any back until Doumya 
Filone chipped off part of your 
disguise. Then I spoke to you. 



52 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Before that, I had to misdirect 
the police. I built up a complete 
and false history for you and kept 
them looking where you weren’t.” 

If he had thought, he would 
have known it had to be that way. 
The police were efficient; they 
could have taken him long ago 
without the aid of the circuit. 
But it had seemed so easy and 
they had trusted the robot — had 
to where the circuit was concern- 
ed. No man could sit in front of 
a screen and interpret the squig- 
gles that meant his hand was 
touching an apple. 

Jadiver sat down. The strain 
was over and he was safe, bound 
for some far-off place. 

“The police used you, though 
not as much as you used them,” 
he said. “Still, they didn’t devel- 
op the theory.” 

“They didn’t. There was a man 
on Earth, a top-notch scientist. 
He worked out the theory and 
set up the mechanism. He had a 
surgical assistant, a person who 
would never be more than that 
on Earth because she wasn’t good 
on theory, though she was a whiz 
at surgery. She realized it and got 
his permission to build another 
machine and take it to Venus. 
Originally it was intended to ac- 
cumulate data on the workings of 
the human nervous system. 

“On Venus, things were dif- 
erent. Laws concerning the rights 
of individuals are not so strict.

She got the idea of examining 
the whole nervous system at 
once, not realizing what it meant 
because it had never been done 
that way. She discussed it with 
officials from the police depart- 
ment who saw instantly what 
she didn’t — that once an exten- 
sive circuit was in a human, there 
was no way to get it out, except 
by death. They had no objec- 
tions and were quite willing to 
furnish her with specimens, for 
their own purposes and only in- 
cidentally hers. Once the first 
man died, they had her and 
wouldn’t let her back out, though 
she wanted to.” 

Specimen,” repeated Jadiver. 
“Yeah, I was a specimen to her.” 
His head was heavy. "Why didn’t 
you tell me this in the begin- 
ning?” 

"Would you have listened 
when I first contacted you?” ask- 
ed the robot. “Later, perhaps. 
But once you put on the shield, 
I couldn’t get in touch with you 
until you were with Doumya 
Filone.” 

W OULD Jadiver have listen- 
ed? Not until it became a 
matter of raw survival. Even now 
he hated to leave Earth and what 
, it meant for the unknown dangers 
and tedium of a planet circling 
an alien sun. It was more than 
that, of course. Just as he’d had 
a design for a perfect robot, he 



had in mind a perfect woman. 
He could recognize either when 
he saw it. 

“Doumya Filone was the as- 
sistant?” 

“She was.” The robot was his 
now, Jadiver knew. Others had 
built it, but it belonged to him 
by virtue of a nervous system. 
It had as good a mind as his, but 
it wouldn’t dispute his claim. 
“Like yourself,” continued the 
robot, “in the Solar System she 
would never have been more than 
second rate, and she wanted to 
be first. Hardly anyone recog- 
nizes it, but the Solar System is 
not what it once was. It’s like a 
nice neighborhood that decays so 
slowly that the people in it don’t 
notice what it’s become. There 
are some who can rise even in a 
slum, but they’re the rare ex- 
ceptions. 

“Others need greater opportu- 
nity than slums offer. They have 
to leave if they expect to develop 
freely. But the hold of a whole 
culture is strong and it’s hard to 
persuade them that they have to 
go.” The robot paused. “Take a 
last look at a blighted area.” 

Outside planets glimmered in 
the distance. 

Jadiver was tired and his eyes 
were closing. Now he could sleep 
safely, but not in peace. 

"Don’t regret it,” advised the 
robot. “Where you’re going, you’ll 
have real designs to work on. No

more pretty robot faces.” 

“Where is it — Alpha Centauri?” 
Jadiver asked disinterestedly. 

“That ship left yesterday. They 
got their quota and left within 
the hour, before any of the pas- 
sengers could change their minds. 
We’re going farther, to Sirius.” 

OIRIUS. A mighty sun, with 
^ planets to match. It was a 
place to be big. Big and lonely. 

“I can’t force you to do any- 
thing,” said the robot. It sounded 
pleased. “But I have no inhibi- 
tions about others.” 

The robot flipped up its cowl. 
There was a storage space and a 
woman in it. 

Except for her hands, she was 



bound tightly by tangle strands. 

“I don’t think she likes you at 
the moment,” said the robot. 
“She’ll tell you that as soon as 
she’s able to speak. She may re- 
lent later, when she realizes what 
it’s really like on Sirius. You’ve 
got the whole voyage to convince 
her.” 

The eye-stalks of the robot 
followed Jadiver interestedly. 
“Are you looking for the tongs? 
Remember that the tangle stuff 
is repelled by your skin.” 

Jadiver willingly used his hands 
and the tangle strands fell off. 

As the robot had predicted, 
Doumya Filone was not silent — 
at first.

the 

water eater 

By WIN MARKS 

Most experiments were dropped 
because they failed— and some 
because they worked too well! 

Illustrated by BALBALIS 



I JUST lost a weekend. I ain’t 
too anxious to find it. In- 
stead, I sure wish I had gone 
fishing with McCarthy and the 
boys like I’d planned. 

I drive a beer truck for a liv- 
ing, but here it is almost noon 
Monday and I haven’t turned a 
wheel. Sure, I get beer wholesale, 
and I have been known to take 
some advantage of my discount. 
But that wasn’t what happened 



to this weekend. 

Instead of fishing or bowling 
or poker or taking the kids down 
to the amusement park over Sat- 
urday and Sunday, I’ve been 
losing sleep over an experiment. 

Down at the Elks’ Club, the 
boys say that for a working stiff 
I have a very inquiring mind. I 
guess that’s because they always 
see me reading Popular Science 
and Scientific American and such, 



56 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



instead of heading for the stack 
of Esquires that are piled a foot 
deep in the middle of the big 
table in the reading room, like 
the rest of them do. 

Well, it was my inquiring mind 
that lost me my wife, the skin of 
my right hand, a lot of fun and 
sleep — yeah, not a wink of sleep 
for two days now! Which is the 
main reason I’m writing this 
down now. I’ve read somewheres 
that if you wrote down your 
troubles, you could get them out 
of your system. 

I thought I had troubles Fri- 
day night when I pulled into the 
driveway and Lottie yelled at me 
from the porch, “The fire’s out! 
And it’s flooded. Hurry up!” 

Trouble, hah! That was just 
the beginning. 

T OTTIE is as cute a little ex- 
" waitress as ever flipped the 
suds off a glass of beer, but she 
just ain’t mechanically minded. 
The day Uncle Alphonse died 
and left us $2500 and I went out 
and bought a kitchen and shed 
full of appliances for her, that 
was a sad day, all right. She has 
lived a fearful life ever since, too 
proud of her dishwasher and 
automatic this and that to con- 
sider selling them, but scared 
stiff of the noises they make and 
the vibrations and all the mys- 
terious dials and lights, etc. 

So this Friday afternoon when 



the oil-burner blew out from the 
high wind, she got terrified, sent 
the kids over to their grandmoth- 
er’s in a cab and sat for two 
hours trying to make up her mind 
whether to call the fire depart- 
ment or the plumber. 

Meanwhile, this blasted oil 
stove was overflowing into the 
fire pot. 

“Well, turn it off!” I yelled. 
“I’ll be in right away!” 

I ducked into the garage and 
got a big handful of rags and a 
hunk of string and a short stick. 
This I have been through before. 
I went in and kissed her pretty 
white face, and a couple of worry 
lines disappeared. 

“Get me a pan or something,” 
I said and started dismantling 
the front of the heater. 

These gravity -flow oil heaters 
weren't built to make it easy to 
drain off excess oil. There’s a 
brass plug at the inlet, but no 
one in history has been able to 
stir one, the oil man told me. I 
Weigh 200 pounds stripped, but 
all I ever did was ruin a tool try- 
ing. 

The only way to get out the 
oil was to open the front, stuff 
rags down through the narrow 
fire slot, sop up the stuff and fish 
out the rags with the string tied 
around one end of the bundle. 
Then you wring out the rags with 
your bare hands into a pan. 

“Hey, Lottie,” I yelled, “this 



THE WATER EATER 



57 



is your roaster! It’ll be hard to 
clean out the oil smell!” 

But, of course, it was too late. 
I had squeezed a half -pint of oil 
into it already. So I went on 
dunking and wringing and think- 
ing how lousy my cigarettes were 
going to taste all evening and 
feeling glad that I delivered beer 
instead of oil for a living. 

T GOT the stove bailed out and 

lit with only one serious blast 
of soot out the ‘‘Light Here” 
hole. Then I dumped the oil out 
in the alley and set the roaster 
pan in the sink. Lottie was peel- 
ing potatoes for dinner, and she 
snuggled her yellow curls on my 
shoulder kind of apologetically 
for the mess she had caused me. 
I scrubbed the soot and oil off 
my hands and told her it was all 
right, only next time, for gosh 
sakes, please turn the stove off 
at least. 

The water I was splashing into 
the roaster gathered up in little 
shrinking drops and reminded me 
that the pig-hocks I brought 
home for Sunday dinner were 
going to rate throwing out unless 
we got the oil smell out of the 
pan. 

“Tell you what you do,” I said 
to Lottie. “Get me all your clean- 
ing soaps and stuff and let’s see 
what we got.” 

Lottie is always trying out 
some new handy-dandy little 



kitchen helper compound, so she 
hefted up quite an armload. 
Now, when I was in high school, I 
really liked chemistry. “Charlie, 
Boy Scientist,” my pals used to 
sneer at me. But I was pretty 
good at it, and I been reading the 
science magazines right along ever 
since. So I know what a detergent 
is supposed to do, and all about 
how soaps act, and stuff that 
most people take the advertisers’ 
word for. 

“This one,” I told Lottie, “has 
a lot of caustic in it, see?” 

She nodded and said that’s the 
one that ruined her aluminum 
coffee pot. She remembered it 
specially. 

I poured some very hot tap 
water into the roaster and shook 
in the strong soap powder. “This 
is to saponify the oil,” I ex- 
plained. 

“What’s saponify?” Lottie 
asked. 

“That means to make soap. 
Soap is mainly a mixture of some 
caustic with fat or oil. It makes 
sudsy soap.” 

“But we got soap,” she said. 
“Why don’t you just use the soap 
we got?” 

We went into the business of 
soap-making pretty deep. Mean- 
while, I read some more labels 
and added pinches of this and 
that detergent and a few squirts 
of liquid “wonder-cleaners” that 
didn’t say what was in them. 



58 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



In her crisp Scotch way, Lottie 
got across to me that she thought 
I was wasting soap powder and 
my time and cluttering up the 
sink while she was busy there, so 
I wound up with half a cup of 
Doozey soap flakes, filled the pan 
to the brim and set the concoc- 
tion at the back of the drain 
board to do its business. 

VV7HEN dinner was over, I was 
"" in the living room reading 
the paper when I heard Lottie 
muttering at the sink. Lottie 
doesn’t usually mutter, so I went 
out to see what was wrong. 

“Nice mess,” she said and 
pointed at the roaster. The stuff 
had cooled and jelled into a half- 
solid condition. 

“Hah!” I said. “We had a 
supersaturated solution. When it 
cooled off, it coagulated.” 

Lottie scowled. It makes her 
nervous when I use big words 
'Which I only do when I’m talking 
about chemistry and the like. 

“Well, uncoogalate it and dump 
it out of my roaster,” she told me. 

My scientific inquiring mind 
• was stirred as I lifted the pan over 
to the table under the center 
light. We had here a gelatin of 
various cleaners, and every one 
of them claiming to be best ever. 
What would this new combina- 
tion do? 

I grabbed a pan off the stove 
that had a mess of scorched car- 



rot leavings in the bottom. Lottie 
had been soaking it with about 
a half inch of water. As I reached 
for a tablespoon, Lottie objected. 
“Look, now, if you are going to 
start another experiment, dump 
that mess out first and let me 
work on the roaster. 

I saved about a cupful of the 
slimy gunk and she went back 
to her dishes. 

“You’ll be sorry,” I said under 
my breath, “if this turns out to 
be the only batch of the finest 
cleaner in the whole world. And 
us with only a cupful.” 

A minute later, I was glad she 
hadn’t heard me. When I drop- 
ped a little glob of the stuff into 
the carrot pan and stirred it 
around a bit, instead of dissolv- 
ing and diluting in the extra 
water, the mixture seemed to 
stay the same density after swal- 
lowing up the water. 

“Give me a pie tin,” I de- 
manded. 

Lottie sighed, but she got a 
shallow pan out of the pantry 
and handed it to me. Then I 
poured the jelly out of the carrot 
pan and I made my first impor- 
tant discovery. 

The stuff was not good for 
cleaning out scorched carrots. 

The pot was bone-dry. So were 
the carrots. They had a desiccat- 
ed look and were stuck worse 
than ever to the bottom. I brush- 
ed them with my finger and the 



THE WATER EATER 



59 



top layers powdered to dust. Then 
I noticed that not a droplet or 
smidgin of the jelly remained in 
the pot. When I had poured it 
out, it had gone out all at the 
same time, as if it was trying to 
hang together. 

The carbonized carrots at the 
very bottom were hard and dry, 
too. A scrape job if I ever saw 
one. 

\ 

rTiHE pie tin was now full al- 
most to the rim. The globby 
stuff sort of rolled around, trying 
to find a flat condition, which it 
finally did. The motion was not 
as startling as the sudden quiet 
that settled over the surface after 
a last ripple. 

The stuff looked like it was 
waiting. 

The temptation was worse 
than a park bench labeled “wet 
paint,” so I stuck my finger in 
it. Right in the middle of it. 

A ripple flashed out from the 
center like when you drop a peb- 
ble in a pool, and the ripple hit 
the brim and converged back to 
my finger. When it hit, the sur- 
face climbed up my finger about 
an eighth of an inch. Another 
ripple, another eighth of an inch, 
and about now I felt something 
like a gentle sucking sensation. 
Also, another feeling I can only 
tell you was “unclammy.” 

I jerked away fast and shook 
my finger hard over the pan, but 



it wasn’t necessary. None of the 
stuff had stayed with me. In fact, 
my finger was dry — powdery 
dry! 

Then I got the feeling that 
someone was staring over my 
shoulder. There was. It was Lot- 
tie, and she had a look of horror 
on her face that didn’t help my 
nerves a bit. 

“Get rid of it, Charlie!” she 
cried. “Get rid of it! Please throw 
it out!” 

“Now, now, honey,” I said. “It 
ain’t alive.” 

“It is!” she insisted. 

Lottie chatters quite a bit and 
pretty well speaks her mind. But 
she doesn’t go around making as- 
sertions. When she does come out 
flat-footed with a serious state- 
ment, it is always from the 
bottom of her 22 -carat womanly 
intuition, and she is practically 
always right. 

“How could it be alive?” I ar- 
gued. I often argue when I know 
I’m wrong. This time I argued 
because I wanted to wipe that 
awful look off my wife’s face. 
“Come on in the living room and 
relax,” I said. 

A ND then sweet-natured, hon- 
ey-haired little Lottie did a 
violent thing. Still staring over 
my shoulder at the pie tin, she 
screamed wide-open and ran out 
of the house. A second later, I 
heard her start the car out the 



60 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



driveway at 30 miles an hour in 
reverse. She burned rubber out 
in front and was gone. 

I hadn't moved an inch. Be- 
cause when she screamed, I look- 
ed back at the jelly to see why, 
and the stuff had oozed over the 
edge and was flowing slowly to- 
ward me. 

I know a little about Korzyb- 
ski and how he wanted everybody 
to make what he called a cortico- 
thalamic pause whenever they get 
scared as hell. So I was making 
this cortico-thalamic pause, which 
is really counting to ten before 
you do anything, while Lottie 
was leaving the house. When I 
got through with my pause, I 
jumped backward over my kitch- 
en chair so hard that I must have 
knocked my head on the tile 
sink-board. 

When I came to, it was after 
midnight. The kitchen light was 
still on. Lottie was still gone. I 
knew it. If she was here, she’d 
have had me in bed. No matter 
how much of my employer’s 
product I have sampled, never 
has Lottie let me sleep it off on 
the kitchen floor. Her 110 pounds 
is a match for my 200 in more 
ways than one, and she takes 
good care of her man. 

Then I realized that this was 
not a stag beer-bust. There was 
something about a pot of soap- 
jelly. 

It was still there. A long slug 



of the half-transparent stuff had 
strung down off the edge of the 
table and still hung there like a 
nasty-looking icicle. 

The knob on the back of my 
head throbbed so much that at 
first I couldn’t figure what was 
wrong with the air. Then my 
aching dry throat told me what 
the matter was. The air was dry 
like the summer we spent at a 
dude ranch in Arizona. It made 
my nostrils crimp, and my tongue 
felt like a mouthful of wrinkled 
pepperoni. 

When I got to my feet and 
looked at the top of the kitchen 
table, I almost panicked again. 
But this time the pause worked 
and I got better results. 

Alive or dead, the gunk was the 
most powerful desiccant I’d ever 
heard of. It had drunk up the 
water in the carrot pot, sucked 
the surface moisture from my 
finger and then spent the past 
few hours feeding on the humidi- 
ty in the air. 

It was thirsty. Like alcohol has 
affinity for water, this stuff was 
the same way, only more SO; In 
fact, it even reached out toward 
anything that had water in it — 
like me. 

That’s why it had oozed over 
the pan the way it did. 

WV7HAT’S so frightening about 
that, I asked myself. Plants 
grow toward water. 



THE WATER EATER 



61 




But plants are alive! 

That’s what Lottie had said — 
before she screamed. 

“So you’re thirsty?” I asked it 
out loud. “Okay, we’ll give you 
a real drink!” 

I got a bucket from the service 
porch and took the pancake turn- 
er to scrape the gooey nightmare 
into it. I even caught the drip 
off the edge, and it seemed quiet- 
ly grateful to sink back to the 
parent glob in the pail, which by 
now amounted to about a quart. 

I set the pail in the laundry 
tray and turned on the faucet 
hard. In about a second and a 
half, I almost sprained my wrist 
turning it ioff. Not only did the 
jelly drink up the water without 
dissolving, but it started creeping 
up the stream in a column about 
three inches in diameter, with the 



water pouring down its middle. 



62 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



When I got the water shut off, 
the unholy jelly-spout slopped 
back disappointedly. 

And now the bucket was over 
half full of the stuff. 

I dropped in an ice-cube as an 
experiment. It didn’t even splash. 
The surface pulled away, letting 
the cube make a pretty good dent 
in it, but then only gradually did 
the displaced goo creep back 
around it as if to sample it cau- 
tiously. 

I couldn’t stand the dry air 
any more, so I threw open the 
doors and windows and let the 
cool, damp night air come in. The 
ice-cube had disappeared without 
even a surface puddle. Now, as 
the humidity came back, I 
thought I noticed a restless shim- 
mering in the jelly. 

The phone rang. It was Lottie’s 
mother wanting to know why 
Lottie had come over there in 
hysterics, and where had I been 
since seven o’clock. I don’t re- 
member what I answered, but it 
served the purpose. Lottie hasn’t 
returned and they haven’t called 
up any more. 

When I returned to the bucket, 
it seemed that the stuff was deep- 
er yet, but I couldn’t tell because 
I hadn’t marked the level. I got 
Lottie’s fever thermometer out of 
the medicine chest and took the 
jelly’s temperature. It read 58 
degrees F. The wall thermometer 
read 58 degrees, too. Room tem- 



perature, with the windows open. 
What kind of “life” could this 
be that had no temperature of its 
own? 

But then what kind of a fancy- 
pants metabolism could you ex- 
pect out of an organism that fed 
on nothing but Lake Michigan 
water, right out of the reservoir? 

¥ GOT a pencil and notebook 
out of Lottie’s neat little desk 
and started making notes. 

I wondered about the density 
of the stuff. Ice floated in it and 
the bucket seemed heavy. I broke 
the thermometer and tapped a 
drop of mercury onto the restless 
surface. The droplet sank slowly 
to the bottom with no apparent 
effect either way. 

Heavier than water. Lighter 
than mercury. 

I took a beer out of the refrig- 
erator and swallowed it. The last 
drops I sprinkled into the pail? 
The drippings sizzled across the 
surface until only a fine dust was 
left. A tiny ripple flipped this 
dust over to the edge of the pail 
as if clearing the thirsty decks for 
action. But this drew my eyes to 
the rim of the liquid. There was 
no meniscus, either up or down. 

Remembering back, I figured 
this meant there was no surface 
tension, which reminded me that 
part of this mixture was made of 
detergent. 

But had I created a new form 



THE WATER EATER 



63 



of life? Like Lottie said, was it 
really alive? Certainly it could 
reproduce itself. It had brains 
enough to know the direction of 
more water, like when it took off 
after me on the table. 

Not long ago, there was this 
important physicist who wrote 
about how life probably got start- 
ed away back when the Earth was 
just forming. He argued that 
special creation was more or less 
a lot of hogwash, and that what 
actually took place was that as 
the Earth cooled, all the hot 
chemicals mixing around sort of 
stumbled onto a combination or 
two that took on the first char- 
acteristics of life. 

In other words, this guy left 
off where Mr. Darwin began his 
theory of evolution. 

Now me, I don’t know. Lottie 
makes me go to church with the 
kids every Sunday and I like it. 
If this chemical theory about life 
getting started is ' right — well, 
then, a lot of people got the 
wrong idea about things, I always 
figured. 

But how would I or this physi- 
cist explain this quivering mess 
of protoplasm I got on my hands 
by accident this particular Fri- 
day night? 

I experimented some more. I 
got out the kids’ junior encyclo- 
pedia and looked up some things 
I’d forgot, and some I had never 
learned in the first place. 



S O it got to be Saturday morn- 
ing. Fred and Claude phoned 
about the fishing trip* and I made 
an excuse. No one else bothered 
me. All day Saturday, I studied. 
And all Saturday night and Sun- 
day. But I couldn’t figure out 
any sensible answers that would 
make peace with my minister. 

It looked like I had created 
some form of life. Either that 
or some life-form in the stove oil 
that had been asleep a billion 
years had suddenly found a con- 
dition to its liking and had de- 
cided to give up hibernating in 
favor of reproduction. 

What drove me on was the 
thought that I must have some- 
thing here that was commercially 
important — a new culture of 
something that would revolution- 
ize some branch of chemistry or 
biology. I wouldn’t even stop to 
fry an egg. I chewed up some 
crackers and drank a few more 
bottles of beer when my stomach 
got too noisy. I wasn’t sleepy, al- 
though my eyes felt like they 
were pushed four inches into my 
skull. * 

Junior’s little chemistry set 
didn’t tell me very much when 
I made the few tests I knew how. 
Litmus paper remained either 
red or blue when stuck into the 
jelly. This surprised me a little 
because this whole mass of de- 
sudsed washing compound mix- 
ture had started out with a 



64 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



pretty good shot of lye in it. 

So my notes grew, but my use- 
ful information didn’t. By mid- 
night Sunday, it appeared that 
my jelly invention had only one 
important talent: The ability to 
drink endlessly anything con- 
taining water. And only the water 
was used, it seemed. Dissolved 
solids were cast aside in the form 
of variously colored dusts. 

By now, the goop had out- 
grown the pail and was two- 
thirds up in the laundry tub. A 
slow drip from the faucet kept 
the surface of my monster in a 
constant state of frenzy, like 
feeding a rumpot beer by the 
thimbleful. 

It was fascinating to watch the 
little curleycues of jelly flip up 
after each drop, reaching for 
more, and then falling back with 
a cranky little lash. 

A T two o’clock this morning, I 
began to get a little sense in 
me. Or maybe it was just the 
fear finally catching up again. 

There was danger here. 

I was too fuzzy to know exactly 
what the danger was, but I began 
to develop a husky hate for the 
whole project. 

“Kill it!” came into my mind. 
“Get rid of it, Charlie!” 

Lottie’s scream shrilled back 
into my ears, and this command 
became very important to me. I 
became angry. 



“Want a drink, do you?” I 
shouted out loud. I put on the tea 
kettle and when it was to full 
steam, I took it back to the tub. 
“I’ll give you a drink with a 
kick in it!” 

What happened, I would like 
to forget. Ten times as fast as it 
had climbed up the cold water 
spout, it ran up the boiling water 
stream, into the tea kettle, blew 
off the lid and swarmed over my 
hand with a scalding-dry slither 
that made me drop the kettle 
into the tub and scream with 
pain. 

The jelly steamed and stuck 
to my flesh long enough to sear 
it half to the bone. Then it slop- 
ped back with the rest and left 
me grabbing my wrist and tear- 
ing at the flesh with my finger- 
nails to stop the pain. 

Then I got insane mad. I got 
my big blowtorch I use for peel- 
ing paint, and I lit it and pumped 
it up as high as it would go and 
aimed it down into that tub. 

Not too much happened. The 
jelly shrank away from the roar- 
ing blast, but it didn’t climb over 
the edge of the tub. It shrank 
some more and I poured the 
flame on. 

It didn’t burn. It just got to 
be less and less, and what was 
left began to get cloudy. And 
when I hit the bottom of the tub, 
the last glob moved around pret- 
ty active, trying to escape the . 



THE WATER EATER

heat, but I got it. Every damned 
last shred of it, and I was laugh- 
ing and crying when I dropped 
the torch into the tub. I had been 
holding it with my scalded hand 
and I guess I fainted. 

I wasn’t out long. I got up and 
dressed my hand with lard, and 
it felt pretty good. Took a couple 
of aspirins and sat down at Lot- 
tie’s typewriter. I know I won’t 
sleep until I get this off my mind 
in about the way it happened, 
because I probably won’t believe 
all of it myself when I get back 
to normal. 

I just now went out and fished 
the blowtorch out of the laundry 
tub. All there was left in the 
bottom of the tub was maybe 
half a pound of singed-looking — 
soap flakes? 

T HERE, I’ve finished writing 
this all down. But I’m still not 
sleepy. I’m not worried about 



patching things up with Lottie. 
She’s the most wonderful, under- 
standing wife a guy ever had. 

My hand feels real good now. 

I got it wrapped in lard and 
gauze, and I could drive the 
truck if I wanted to. 

I’m not afraid of getting fired 
or bawled out for not coming to 
work on time this morning. 

No, the reason I haven’t turned 
a wheel on my beer truck today 
is something else. 

Friday night, when Lottie 
wanted to wash the roaster, I 
saved only a cup of the jelly for 
my experiments. The rest she 
washed down the drain. 

The sewer empties into Lake 
Michigan. 

The brewery where I load up is 
right on the shore of Lake Michi- 
gan. 

I’m afraid to drive down there 
and look.

THE INTRACTABLE 
PRIME NUMBER 

J UST about two centuries ago 
there lived in my father’s 
town of Koenigsberg a gen- 
tleman by the name of Christian 
Goldbach. He was a mathema- 
tician by profession and a good 
one, though not an outstanding 
genius or a great innovator in his 
science. When he died in 1764 he

left a theorem behind which is 
in itself simple enough to be un- 
derstood by a school child. It 
does not even need to be express- 
ed as a formula to be stated con- 
cisely. 

It simply says that every even 
number can be written as the 
sum of two prime numbers. 

Try it. Any two prime numbers 
from “3” on up will always result 
in an even number when added 
together. Nor will you be able to 
find an even number that cannot 
be expressed as the sum of two 
primes. 

If the figure you pick is not too 
small, it can probably be express- 
ed as the sum of two primes in 
a number of different ways. For 
example, 100 can be written as 
3 + 97, or as 11 + 89, 17 -f 83, 
41 -f- 59, 47 -}- 53, and a number 
of other ways. 

The trouble with Goldbach’s 
beautiful and simple theorem is 
that it cannot be proved. Trying 
it out on any number of figures 
is no proof, if only because the 
amount of even numbers is in- 
finite. A proof would consist of 
a sentence, or a paragraph, or, if 
necessary, a book which shows 
why this has to be so. Goldbach 
himself could not furnish such 
proof and later mathematicians, 
both professional and amateur, 
who went after the problem had 
to give up sooner or later in total 
defeat. 



W HEN attacking such a rid- 
dle, it is often useful to 
establish all the characteristics of 
the units involved. If we knew 
enough about the mathematical 
laws governing prime numbers, 
we might find the one which is 
responsible for the workability 
of Goldbach’s theorem. That 
alone might be the reason why 
we can’t prove it, for if there are 
specific laws governing the occur- 
rence and structure of prime 
numbers, we haven’t found them 
yet. 

But let’s go over the ground 
systematically and begin with the 
definition of a prime number. 
That's easy — a prime number is 
a whole number which does not 
have any divisors. Or to put it 
into the stricter language of num- 
ber theory: “An integer p which 
is larger than 1 is called a prime 
number if the only divisors are 
the trivial ones ± 1 and ± p.” 
In this phraseology, the “1” is 
not considered a prime number, 
but many number theorists count 
“1” as a prime number, too. They 
are all agreed that “2” is a prime 
number, the only even prime 
number in existence. It is also the 
only prime which — for just this 
reason — must be left out when 
using Goldbach’s theorem. The 
next number “3” is also a prime 
and so are “5,” “7,” and “11.” 
After them follow “13,” “17” and 
“19.”

A method for establishing prime 
numbers has come down to us 
from antiquity and is known as 
the Sieve of Eratosthenes. To use 
it, you write down all the num- 
bers in the interval you wish to 
investigate, say from “1” to “100.” 
Then you cross out all even num- 
bers except the “2,” for all even 
numbers are divisible by “2 ” 
Next you cross out all remaining 
numbers which are divisible by 
“3,” except the “3” itself. They 
are easy to recognize, even when 
very large, because all you have 
to do is add their digits together. 

If your number is 13,623, you 
form the sum 14-3 + 6+ 2 + 3 
= 15, with “15” divisible by “3,” 
which means that the figure it- 
self is divisible by “3.” Then you 
cross out all numbers ending with 
a “5” for they are divisible by 
“5” (the numbers ending in a “0” 
which are also divisible by “5” 
are already gone since they are 
also even) and then you proceed 
to those divisible by “7.” It can 
easily be seen that you use suc- 
cessively larger primes, as you 
establish them, to knock out all 
the multiples of these primes. 
The process is tedious, but relia- 
ble. 

The next question is how many 
prime numbers there are. By 
means of the Sieve of Eratos- 
thenes, it has been established 
that there are 26 prime numbers 
in the first hundred; 168 in the 



first thousand; 303 in the first 
two thousand; 78,498 in the first 
million and 50,847,478 in the first 
thousand million. These figures 
show what one would suspect, 
anyway; namely, that the primes 
get rarer as we move up the lad- 
der into larger and larger figures. 

If we go sufficiently high, will 
we come to a point where there 
are no primes left? 

T HE answer is no and again 
the proof has come to us from 
antiquity. Euclid himself estab- 
lished it. Supposing somebody 
claimed that the figure Z were 
the largest and last of the prime 
numbers, we then take all the 
smaller primes and multiply 
them, beginning with 1 times 2 
times 3 times 5 times 7 times 11 
and we go through all of them 
until we have reached the prime 
below Z. Then we multiply the 
whole by Z, obtaining a much 
larger figure which we call P. 
Because of the way we construct- 
ed this figure, we can be certain 
that P is not a prime. But how 
about P + 1? 

Well, P + 1 either is a prime 
or it isn’t. If it is, we have a prime 
much bigger than Z. If P + 1 is 
not a prime, it can only be divisi- 
ble by an unknown prime which 
must be smaller than P, but 
larger than Z. So whether P + 1 
is a prime or not, it proves that 
Z cannot be the largest prime.

No matter how high we climb in 
the realm of numbers, every once 
in a while we are bound to en- 
counter a prime. 

This, of course, brings up the 
question about the largest prime 
actually known. It is a really 
monstrous figure, even though it 
can be written down in a simple 
form: 2 127 — 1. This, at any 
event, is easier to memorize than 
the same figure in arithmetic long 
hand where it reads: 

170,141,183,460,469,231,731,687,- 

303,715,884,105,727. 

How 2 127 — 1 was found is a 
small story in itself. At this point, 
it is important that this figure 
had to be found and then estab- 
lished as a prime. It could not be 
constructed, for there is no meth- 
od of constructing large primes. 
Quite a number of mathemati- 
cians have tried to find such a 
method, partly because they 
might have been bored with the 
tedious Sieve of Eratosthenes; 
mostly, however, because a meth- 
od of constructing primes would 
be a version of one of the mathe- 
matical laws governing prime 
numbers. 

Probably the first attempt to 
find such a method was that of 
Pierre de Fermat, a Frenchman 
who lived from 1601 to 1665 and 
who, although technically an 
“amateur,” was one of the great 
mathematicians of history. 

Pierre de Fermat believed that 



the expression 

2 ( 2 “) + 1 

where “n” successively assumes 
the value of 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., could 
be used for the construction of 
primes. Not of all primes, of 
course, but he thought that every 
figure constructed in accordance 
with that expression would be a 
prime. In action, it would look 
like this: 

n=0, therefore 2‘ -1-1=3 



n=l. 




2* + 1=5 


n=2. 




2 * +1 = 17 


n=3, 




2" +1=257 


n=4, 




2 18 +1=65,537 


n=5, 




2 m +1 =4,294,967,297 



and up to 65,537 these figures 
actually are primes. 

The figure for n=5 was also 
believed to be a prime for at least 
a hundred years. But then the 
great Leonhard Euler, who lived 
at about the same time as Gold- 
bach, found this “prime” could 
be obtained by multiplying 6,- 
700,417 by 641. 

T^ERMAT’S failure to find the 
-*■ limitation of his own method 
makes one wonder whether he 
and his compatriot and contem- 
porary Marin Mersenne actually 
possessed a (lost) method for 
recognizing large primes instant- 
ly. The existence of such a meth- 
od had been suspected because 
of the following: 

One day, Fermat received a 
letter asking whether 100,895,- 



70 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



598,169 was a prime. Reportedly. 
Fermat replied without hesitation 
that the figure was not a prime, 
but the product of two primes, 
898,423 and 112,303. Nobody 
knows how he could tell so fast, 
but the assumption of a method 
for recognizing large primes is 
not convincing in the light of the 
breakdown of his own formula. 

At this point I have to devote 
a few lines to Monsieur Marin 
Mersenne, who engaged in cor- 
respondence with all the mathe- 
maticians of his time and was 
practically a one-man mathema- 
tical clearing house. If he were 
alive now, he would undoubtedly 
be the editor of a mathematical 
journal. In one of his books there 
is a short paragraph about num- 
bers of a certain kind which have 
come to be called “Mersenne’s 
Numbers,” even though most 
mathematicians suspect that they 
are really Fermat’s. But since 
Fermat’s name is associated with 
several other things, the designa- 
tion with Mersenne’s name is 
quite useful. The numbers in 
question are numbers of the form 
2 P — 1 and if this expression re- 
minds you of the largest prime 
known, you are correct; it is one 
of ‘‘Mersenne’s numbers.” 

Boiled down to a minimum of 
words, Mersenne’s statement 
reads that numbers of the form 
2 P — 1 are primes if p is 1, 2, 3, 5, 
7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127 or 257. 



In writing this down, Mersenne 
(or his printer) made an error — 
the figure 67 should read 61. Also, 
the two numbers 89 and 107 
should have been included. 
Checking this statement was, of 
course, a terrible grind, especially 
in the higher numbers. The low 
ones are easy: M t (this is the way 
Mersenne’s numbers are usually 
designated) is simply ”1,” M 2 is 
“3,” M 3 is “7,” M 5 is “31.” As 
the rule says neither M 4 nor M 0 
is a prime, the former is “15” and 
the latter “63,” both divisible by 
“3.” 

M 7 is larger than a hundred, 
namely 127; Mi 3 is 8,191, M i7 is 
131,071 and M 10 is 524,287. All 
these numbers were established 
as early as 1600 by an Italian 
named Cataldi. The method he 
used was to divide the number 
to be checked by all prime num- 
bers smaller than the square root 
of the number under investiga- 
tion. 

Leonhard Euler established 
that M 31 is a prime — it is, of 
course, easy to find their numeri- 
cal values, but hard to show what 
these numbers are once you have 
them. Two mathematicians, Per- 
vouchine and Seelhoff, establish- 
ed the nature of M 0 i and incident- 
ally that it should be M fi1 and not 
Me-, and the American mathe- 
matician R. E. Powers added 
M«o to the list (in 1911) and 
three years later M 107 . The next

higher Mersenne prime is M l2 7 or 
2 127 — l, the largest prime known 
and verified. The verification was 
done quite some time ago, by the 
French mathematician Lucas in 
1876, but it was not written out 
numerically until the 1920’s. 

T^HOSE who have a lot of spare 
time and wish to amuse them- 
selves by constructing a few large 
primes might work with two ex- 
pressions which, within limits, 
can be used for this purpose. One 
reads n 2 — n + 41. Here n, as 
usual, is 1, 2, 3, 4, and so forth. 
It works for all values of n up 
to 40. When n grows to be 41, 
the expression defeats itself, for 
it then becomes 41 2 — 41 4- 41 
which is obviously 41 2 and, be- 
ing a square, cannot be a prime. 
Similarly, the expression n 2 — 
79n + 1601 produces primes only 
if n equals 79 or less; it collapses 
when n reaches 80. 

Let’s see now how far we have 
progressed. All we really know is 
that there is no limit to the num- 
ber of primes. Everywhere else 
we have failed — we don’t have 
a method of constructing primes 
and we don’t have a simple meth- 
od of recognizing one when we 
find it. We can’t even tell how 
many primes there must be be- 
tween, say, 1111 and 8888. 

A certain formula says that 
the number of primes between 
1 and X resembles the figure you 



get when you divide X by its own 
“natural” (or basis e) logarithm. 
But the result only resembles the 
truth. For X = 100, the formula 
yields 21.7 instead of 26; for X 
= 1000, it produces 145 instead 
of 168, while for X = l', 000, 000, 
the figure is 72,382 and should be 
78,498. So the best you can ex- 
pect is a general guess — all the 
hard work has to be done just as 
if that formula did not exist. 

Now let’s look at something 
else. Low in the realm of numbers 
you have quite an assortment of 
“pairs of primes.” Typical ex- 
amples are 11:13, 17:19, 29:31, 
41:43 and 101:103, two primes 
separated by one (even) number 
only. We know that primes must 
occur, if rarely, no matter how 
large the figures. How about 
prime pairs? Nobody can tell; 
there is no proof either way. 

Nor is there any rule for the 
interval between primes. Low 
down, between “1” and “23,” the 
intervals are small. The first in- 
terval over five numbers occurs 
between “89” and “97,” the first 
interval of more than ten num- 
bers between “113” and “127.” 
Naturally the intervals grow larg- 
er as the figures grow; the largest 
known- interval occurs between 
4,652,353 and 4,652,507, an in- 
terval of 154 numbers. It is al- 
most needless to add that there 
is no known rhyme or reason to 
those intervals, either.

In short, in spite of centuries 
of mathematical effort, the prime 
numbers are still as intractable 
as they were in the time of Euclid. 

As for Goldbach’s theorem, I 
was still taught, some twenty-five, 
years ago, that nobody had suc- 
ceeded in doing anything about 
it. That has changed to some ex- 
tent. According to George Gam- 
ow, two Russian mathematicians 
have made some inroads on the 
problem. One of them, Schnirel- 
man, proved in 1931 that each 
even number is the sum of not 
more than 300,000 primes. Now 
this might be an interesting 
mathematical development, but 
the outsider has the distinct im- 
pression that “not more than 
300,000 primes” isn't much help. 

A dozen years or so after 
Schnirelman came Vinogradoff, 
proving that every even number 
can be expressed as the sum of 
four primes. But Goldbach’s as- 
sertion that it can be done with 
two primes has been found cor- 
rect for every case actually tried. 

There are mathematical honors 
to be had for the man or woman 
41 who can do better than Vino- 
gradoff and prove why. 

ANTIKHTHON 

T>RESUMABLY prompted by 
a comic strip currently ap- 
pearing in a number of newspa- 
pers, several letters ask whether 



it might not be possible that 
there is a planet circling the Sun 
in the same orbit as the Earth, in 
such a manner that the Sun is 
always between us and that other 
planet so that we’ll never be able 
to discover it. These letters were 
answered as they came in. This 
item is intended to forestall those 
that haven’t been written yet. 

To begin with, the idea of a 
planet “at the other end” of 
Earth’s orbit is not precisely new. 
It was invented more than two 
thousand years ago by the Pyth- 
agorean philosophers who saw an 
urgent mystical need for another 
body in the Solar System. 

It has to be remarked first that 
they had something they called 
the “central fire” of which the 
Sun was said to be merely a re- 
flection. Now if you counted the 
bodies in the “Universe” (Solar 
System to us), you had the “cen- 
tral fire,” Sun, Moon, Mercury, 
Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn 
— eight altogether. Adding the 
Earth made nine. But the figure 
nine was not acceptable to the 
Pythagoreans. There had to be 
ten bodies and the way out was 
to postulate the existence of a 
“counter-Earth” or Antikhthon. 
Needless to say, no other philo- 
sophical school paid the faintest 
attention to this innovation. 

But somehow the idea seems to 
be intriguing. 

For an answer, one could point 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



73 



out that there is no “counter- 
Mars” and no “counter-Venus” 
or “counter-Jupiter.” We could 
see those if they existed. But this, 
it must be admitted, is no logical 
proof. Saturn’s rings are real even 
though no other planet in the 
Solar System has rings. So we 
are forced to approach this prob- 
lem from a different angle. 

If there were a planet like the 
ancient Antikhthon, we could 
never see it. This does not mean, 
however, that we could not de- 
tect its presence. Forever hidden 
in the glare of the Sun though it 
would be, the effects of its gravi- 
tational field would not stay hid- 
den. It should influence the orbit 
of Venus. 

Venus, if there were such an 
unknown planet, would “unac- 
countably” deviate from the orbit 
calculated for it. In fact, the 
behavior of Venus would enable 
us to calculate the mass of the 
unknown planet, especially since 
would know its distance from 
the Sun, which would have to be 
93 million miles, like our own. 

But Venus fails to show any 
such “perturbations.” As a result, 
we can take it for granted that the 
Antik,hthon does not exist.

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Why does a full Moon look 
larger on the horizon than it does 



at its zenith? It seems the exact 
opposite should be true, as the 
Moon on the horizon is farther 
away than the Moon overhead. 
Charles Ti singer y 
Bks. S- 32, N.A.T.T.C. 
Memphis 15, Tennessee 
This question is a perennial 
— and let's admit it right in the 
first sentence — unsolved prob- 
lem. It is not an astronomical 
problem, for, as reader Tising- 
er points out, the Moon over- 
head is closer to the observer. 
The difference is on the order 
of 4,000 miles which, compared m 
to the Moon's distance of 240,- 
000 miles, is so little that it 
would not be apparent to naked- 
eye observation. 

The problem is somewhere 
in the realm of either physiol- 
ogy or psychology and probably 
a mixture of both. 

Some have tried to explain it 
by saying that the phenomenon 
is caused by the position of the 
head. If you watch the Moon on 
the horizon, you look straight 
ahead, whereas, if you watch it 
near the zenith, you have to 
lean back. If that were the t 
whole answer, the phenomenon 
should disappear by making 
both observations lying down. 
One man actually claims that it 
did disappear under these cir- 
cumstances. Maybe it worked 
for him, but it does not work 
for me. 



74 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Another explanation says 
that yon have nothing with 
which to compare the size of 
the Moon when it is high in the 
sky, while you do have objects 
(trees, buildings, hills) for 
comparison near the horizon. 
In my opinion, this should tend 
to make it look smaller at the 
horizon, but I know the Moon 
looks bigger. 

In short: explanation unsatis- 
factory. 

I have read that so-called 
shooting stars are new comets 
passing through our solar system. 
If this isn't true, what are they? 
Larry Willey 
55 Dawson Avenue 
Mansfield, Ohio 

Shooting stars are tiny par- 
ticles entering our atmosphere 
from space, at speeds ranging 
anywhere from 7 to 45 miles 
per second. They are so tiny 
that you could not feel them 
if you held some in the palm 
of your hand. Compressing the 
atmosphere in their paths, they 
are heated to such an extent 
that the vast majority of them 
vaporize. Only a small fraction 
of their number reach the 
ground at all. 

Far from being “new com- 
ets,” they are most likely debris 
of very old comets which slowly 



disintegrated in their orbits 
many thousands of years ago. 

How did Halley know the time 
of his comet’s return on a 75 -year 
schedule? Did he live to see his 
comet appear twice? And how is 
it that comets have never collided 
with the planets? 

Shaler Morris 

Veteran's Home, Calif. 

Dr. Edmond Halley saw “his” 
comet only once, in 1682, when 
he was about 26 years old. He 
had just gone over a list of 
comet observations and, while 
there had been many comets at 
Unpredictable intervals, his sus- 
picion was aroused by the fact 
that a large and bright comet 
had been seen at 75-year inter- 
vals. There had been one in 
1531, one in 1607 and his own 
observation in 1682. He felt 
confident that this was the same 
comet, moving in a closed orbit, 
and predicted its return for the 
year 1758. Incidentally, the 
comet was not labeled “Halley’s 
Comet” until the prediction was 
verified by actual observation. 

As for the third question, the 
answer is that we do not know 
whether a comet has ever col- 
lided with a planet. We know 
it has not happened during the 
last few centuries, but we can- 
not be positive about the past.

Well, he’d tell her. The evening 
would be memorable. He would 
propose, there would be kisses,- 
and the seal of acceptance would, 
figuratively speaking, be stamped 
across his forehead. 

Not too pleasant an outlook, 
he decided. It really would be

much more comfortable not to 
be in love. What had done it? 
A look, a touch, a thought? It 
didn’t take much, he knew, and 
stretched his arms for a thorough 
yawn. 

“Help me!” a voice said. 

His muscles spasmed, cutting 
off the yawn in mid-moment. He 
sat upright on the bed, then 
grinned and lay back again. 

"You must help me!” the voice 
insisted. 

Anders sat up, reached for a 
polished shoe and fitted it on, 
giving his full attention to the 
tying of the laces. 

“Can you hear me?” the voice 
asked. “You can, can’t you?” 
That did it. “Yes, I can hear 
you,” Anders said, still in a high 
good humor. “Don’t tell me 
you’re my guilty subconscious, 
attacking me for a childhood 
trauma I never bothered to re- 
solve. I suppose you want me to 
join a monastery.” 

“I don’t know what you’re 
talking about,” the voice said. 
“I’m no one’s subconscious. I’m 
me. Will you help me?” 

Anders believed in voices as 
much as anyone ; that is, he didn’t 
believe in them at all, until he 
heard them. Swiftly he cata- 
logued the possibilities. Schizo- 
phrenia was the best answer, of 
course, and one in which his col- 
leagues would concur. But An- 
ders had a lamentable confidence 



in his own sanity. In which case — 

“Who are you?” he asked. 

“I don’t know,” the voice an- 
swered. 

Anders realized that the voice 
was speaking within his own 
mind. Very suspicious. 

“You don’t know who you are,” 
Anders stated. “Very well. Where 
are you?” 

“I don’t know that, either.” 
The voice paused, and went on. 
“Look, I know how ridiculous 
this must sound. Believe me, I’m 
in some sort of limbo. I don’t 
know how I got here or who I am; 
but I want desperately to get 
out. Will you help me?” 

OTILL fighting the idea of a 
voice speaking within his head, 
Anders knew that his next de- 
cision was vital. He had to ac- 
cept — or reject — his own sanity. 

He accepted it. 

“All right,” Anders said, lacing 
the other shoe. “I’ll grant that 
you’re a person in trouble, and 
that you’re in some sort of tele- 
pathic contact with me. Is there 
anything else you can tell me?” 

“I’m afraid not,” the voice said, 
with infinite sadness. “You’ll have 
to find out for yourself.” 

“Can you contact anyone 
else?” 

“No.” 

“Then how can you talk with 
me?” 

“I don’t know.”

Anders walked to his bureau 
mirror and adjusted his black 
bow tie, whistling softly under his 
breath. Having just discovered 
that he was in love, he wasn’t 
going to let a little thing like a 
voice in his mind disturb him. 

“I really don’t see how I can 
be of any help,” Anders said, 
brushing a bit of lint from his 
jacket. “You don’t know where 
you are, and there don’t seem to 
be any distinguishing landmarks. 
How am I to find you?” He 
turned and looked around the 
room to see if he had forgotten 
anything. 

“I’ll know when you’re close,” 
the voice said. “You were warm 
just then.” 

“Just then?” All he had done 
was look around the room. He 
did so again, turning his head 

The room, from one angle, 
slowly. Then it happened, 
looked different. It was sudden- 
ly a mixture of muddled colors, 
instead of the carefully blended 
pastel shades he had selected. 
The lines of wall, floor and ceil- 
ing were strangely off proportion, 
zigzag, unrelated. 

Then everything went back to 
normal. 

“You were very warm,” the 
voice said. “It’s a question of 
seeing things correctly.” 

Anders resisted the urge to 
scratch his head, for fear of dis- 
arranging his carefully combed 



hair. What he had seen wasn’t 
so strange. Everyone sees one or 
two things in his life that make 
him doubt his normality, doubt 
sanity, doubt his very existence. 
For a moment the orderly Uni- 
verse is disarranged and the fab- 
ric of belief is ripped. 

But the moment passes. 

Anders remembered once, as a 
boy, awakening in his room in the 
middle of the night. How strange 
everything had looked. Chairs, 
table, all out of proportion, swol- 
len in the dark. The ceiling press- 
ing down, as in a dream. 

But that had also passed. 

“Well, old man,” he said, “if I 
get warm again, let me know.” 

“I will,” the voice in his head 
whispered. “I’m sure you’ll find 
me.” 

“I’m glad you’re so sure,” An- 
ders said gaily, switched off the 
lights and left. 

T OVELY and smiling, Judy 
greeted him at the door. 
Looking at her, Anders sensed 
her knowledge of the moment. 
Had she felt the change in him, 
or predicted it? Or was love mak- 
ing him grin like an idiot? 

“Would you like a before-party 
drink?” she asked. 

He nodded, and she led him 
across the room, to the improb- 
able green-and-yellow couch. Sit- 
ting down, Anders decided he 
would tell her when she came

back with the drink. No use in 
putting off the fatal moment. A 
lemming in love, he told him- 
self. 

“You’re getting warm again,” 
the voice said. 

He had almost forgotten his 
invisible friend. Or fiend, as the 
case could well be. What would 
Judy say if she knew he was 
hearing voices? Little things like 
that, he reminded himself, often 
break up the best of romances. 

“Here,” she said, handing him 
a drink. 

Still smiling, he noticed. The 
number two smile — to a prospec- 
tive suitor, provocative and 
understanding. It had been pre- 
ceded, in their relationship, by 
the number one nice-girl smile, 
the don’t - misunderstand - me 
smile, to be worn on all occasions, 
until the correct words have been 
mumbled. 

“That’s right,” the voice said. 
“It’s in how you look at things.” 

Look at what? Anders glanced 
at Judy, annoyed at his thoughts. 
If he was going to play the lover, 
let him play it. Even through the 
astigmatic haze of love, he was 
able to appreciate her blue-gray 
eyes, her fine skin (if one over- 
looked a tiny blemish on the left 
temple), her lips, slightly re- 
shaped by lipstick. 

“How did your classes go to- 
day?” she asked. 

Well, of course she’d ask that, 



Anders thought. Love is marking 
time. 

“All right,” he said. “Teaching 
psychology to young apes — ” 

“Oh, come now!” 

“Warmer,” the voice said. 

What’s the matter with me, 
Anders wondered. She really is 
a lovely girl. The gestalt that is 
Judy, a pattern of thoughts, ex- 
pressions, movements, making up 
the girl I — 

I what? 

Love? 

Anders shifted his long body 
uncertainly on the couch. He 
didn’t quite understand how this 
train of thought had begun. It 
annoyed him. The analytical 
young instructor was better off 
in the classroom. Couldn’t science 
wait until 9:10 in the morning? 

“I was thinking about you to- 
day,” Judy said, and Anders 
knew that she had sensed the 
change in his mood. 

“Do you see?” the voice asked 
him. “You’re getting much better 
at it.” 

“I don’t see anything," Anders 
thought, but the voice was right. 
It was as though he had a clear 
line of inspection into Judy’s 
mind. Her feelings were nakedly 
apparent to him, as meaningless 
as his room had been in that 
flash of undistorted thought. 

“I really was thinking about 
you,” she repeated. 

“Now look,” the voice said.

A NDERS, watching the expres- 
sions on Judy’s face, felt the 
strangeness descend on him. He 
was back in the nightmare per- 
ception of that moment in his 
room. This time it was as though 
he were watching a machine in 
a laboratory. The object of this 
operation was the evocation and 
preservation of a particular 
mood. The machine goes through 
a searching process, invoking 
trains of ideas to achieve the 
desired end. 

“Oh, were you?” he asked, 
amazed at his new perspective. 

“Yes . I wondered what you 
were doing at noon,” the reac- 
tive. machine opposite him on 
the couch said, expanding its 
shapely chest slightly. 

“Good,” the voice said, com- 
mending him for his perception. 

“Dreaming of you, of course,” 
he said to the flesh-clad skeleton 
behind the total gestalt Judy. The 
flesh machine rearranged its 
limbs, widened its mouth to de- 
note pleasure. The mechanism 
searched through a complex of 
fears, hopes, worries, through 
half -remembrances of analogous 
situations, analogous solutions. 

And this was what he loved. 
Anders saw too clearly and hated 
himself for seeing. Through his 
new nightmare perception, the 
absurdity of the entire room 
struck him. 

“Were you really?” the articu- 



lating skeleton asked him. 

“You’re coming closer,” the 
voice whispered. 

To what? The personality? 
There was no such thing. There 
was no true cohesion, no depth, 
nothing except a web of surface 
reactions, stretched across auto- 
matic visceral movements. 

He was coming closer to the 
truth. 

“Sure,” he said sourly. 

The machine stirred, searching 
for a response. 

Anders felt a quick tremor of 
fear at the sheer alien quality 
of his viewpoint. His sense of 
formalism had been sloughed off, 
his agreed-upon reactions by- 
passed. What would be revealed 
next? 

He was seeing clearly, he rea- 
lized, as perhaps no man had 
ever seen before. It was an oddly 
exhilarating thought. 

But could he still return to 
normality? 

“Can I get you a drink?” the 
reaction machine asked. 

At that moment Anders was as 
thoroughly out of love as a man 
could be. Viewing one's intended 
as a depersonalized, sexless piece 
of machinery is not especially 
conducive to love. But it is quite 
stimulating, intellectually. 

Anders didn’t want normality. 
A curtain was being raised and 
he wanted to see behind it. What 
was it some Russian scientist — 



WARM 



81 



Ouspensky, wasn’t it — had said? 

“ Think in other categories." 

That was what he was doing, 
and would continue to do. 

"Good-by,” he said suddenly. 

The machine watched him, 
open-mouthed, as he walked out 
the door. Delayed circuit reac- 
tions kept it silent until it heard 
the elevator door close. 

ff'Y'OU were very warm in 
there,” the voice within his 
head whispered, once he was on 
the street. ‘‘But you still don’t 
understand everything.” 

"Tell me, then,” Anders said, 
marveling a little at his equanim- 
ity. In an hour he had bridged 
the gap to a completely different 
viewpoint, yet it seemed perfectly 
natural. 

“I can’t,” the voice said. “You 
must find it yourself.” 

“Well, let’s see now,” Anders 
began. He looked around at the 
masses of masonry, the conven- 
tion of streets cutting through 
the architectural piles. “Human 
life,” he said, “is a series of con- 
ventions. When you look at a 
girl, you’re supposed to see — a 
pattern, not the underlying form- 
lessness.” 

“That’s true,” the voice agreed, 
but with a shade of doubt. 

“Basically, there is no form. 
Man produces gestalis, and cuts 
form out of the plethora of noth- 
ingness. It’s like looking at a set 



of lines and saying that they rep- 
resent a figure. We look at a mass 
of material, extract it from the 
background and say it’s a man. 
But in truth there is no such 
thing. There are only the human- 
izing features that we — myopic- 
ally — attach to it. Matter is con- 
joined, a matter of viewpoint.” 

“You’re not seeing it now,” 
said the voice. 

“Damn it,” Anders said. He was 
certain that he was on the track 
of something big, perhaps some- 
thing ultimate. “Everyone’s had 
the experience. At some time in 
his life, everyone looks at a 
familiar object and can’t make 
any sense out of it. Momentarily, 
the gestalt fails, but the true 
moment of sight passes. The mind 
reverts to the superimposed pat- 
tern. Normalcy continues.” 

The voice was silent. Anders 
walked on, through the gestalt 
city. 

“There’s something else, isn’t 
there?” Anders asked. 

“Yes.” 

What could that be, he asked 
himself. Through clearing eyis, 
Anders looked at the formality 
he had called his world. 

He wondered momentarily if 
he would have come to this if 
the voice hadn’t guided him. Yes. 
he decided after a few moments, 
it was inevitable. 

But who was the voice? And 
what had he left out? 



82

“Let’s see what a party looks 
like now,” he said to the voice. 

npHE party was a masquarade; 

the guests were all wearing 
their faces. To Anders, their mo- 
tives, individually and collective- 
ly, were painfully apparent. Then 
his vision began to clear further. 

He saw that the people weren’t 
truly individual. They were dis- 
continuous lumps of flesh shar- 
ing a common vocabulary, yet 
not even truly discontinuous. 

The lumps of flesh were a part 
of the decoration of the room and 
almost indistinguishable from it. 
They were one with the lights, 
which lent their tiny vision. They 
were joined to the sounds they 
made, a few feeble tones out of 
the great possibility of sound. 
They blended into the walls. 

The kaleidoscopic view came 
so fast that Anders had trouble 
sorting his new impressions. He 
knew now that these people, exist- 
ed only as patterns, on the same 
basis as the sounds they made 
and the things they thought they 
saw. 

Gestalts, sifted out of the vast, 
unbearable real world. 

“Where’s Judy?” a discontinu- 
ous lump of flesh asked him. This 
particular lump possessed enough 
nervous mannerisms to convince 
the other lumps of his reality. 
He wore a loud tie as further 
evidence. 



“She’s sick,” Anders said. The 
flesh quivered into an instant 
sympathy. Lines of formal mirth 
shifted to formal woe. 

“Hope it isn’t anything seri- 
ous,” the vocal flesh remarked. 

“You’re warmer,” the voice said 
to Anders. 

Anders looked at the object in 
front of him. 

“She hasn’t long to live,” he 
stated. 

The flesh quivered. Stomach 
and intestines contracted in sym- 
pathetic fear. Eyes distended, 
mouth quivered. 

The loud tie remained the 
same. 

“My God! You don’t mean it!” 

“What are you?” Anders asked 
quietly. 

“What do you mean?” the in- 
dignant flesh attached to the £ie 
demanded. Serene within its real- 
ity, it gaped at Anders. Its mouth 
twitched, undeniable proof that 
it was real and sufficient. “You’re 
drunk,” it sneered. 

Anders laughed and left the 
party. 

f^rriHERE is still something 
you don’t know,” the voice 
said. “But you were hot! I could 
feel you near me.” 

“What are you?” Anders asked 
again. 

“I don’t know,” the voice ad- 
mitted. “I am a person. I am I. 
I am trapped.” 



WARM

“So are we all,” Anders said. 
He walked on asphalt, surrounded 
by heaps of concrete, silicates, 
aluminum and iron alloys. Shape- 
less, meaningless heaps that made 
up the gestalt city. 

And then there were the imagi- 
nary lines of demarcation divid- 
ing city from city, the artificial 
boundaries of water and land. 

All ridiculous. 

“Give me a dime for some 
coffee, mister?” something asked, 
a thing indistinguishable from 
any other thing. 

“Old Bishop Berkeley would 
give a nonexistent dime to your 
nonexistent presence,” Anders 
said gaily. 

“I’m really in a bad way,” the 
voice whined, and Anders per- 
ceived that it was no more than 
a series of modulated vibrations. 

“Yes! Go on!” the voice com- 
manded. 

“If you could spare me a 
quarter — ” the vibrations said, 
with a deep pretense at meaning. 

No, what was there behind the 
senseless patterns? Flesh, mass. 
What was that? All made up of 
atoms. 

“I’m really hungry,” the in- 
tricately arranged atoms mut- 
tered. 

All atoms. Conjoined. There 
were no true separations between 
atom and atom. Flesh was stone, 
stone was light. Anders looked at 
the masses of atoms that were 



pretending to solidity, meaning 
and reason. 

“Can’t you help me?” a clump 
of atoms asked. But the clump 
was identical with all the other 
atoms. Once you ignored the su- 
perimposed patterns, you could 
see the atoms were random, scat- 
tered. 

“I don’t believe in you,” Anders 
said. 

The pile of atoms was gone. 

“Yes!” the voice cried. “Yes!” 

“I don’t believe in any of it,” 
Anders said. After all, what was 
an atom? 

“Go on!” the voice shouted. 
“You’re hot! Go on!” 

What was an atom? An empty 
space surrounded by an empty 
space. 

Absurd ! 

“Then it’s all false!” Anders 
said. And he was alone under 
the stars. 

“That’s right!” the voice with- 
in his head screamed. “Nothing!” 

But stars, Anders thought. How 
can one believe — 

The stars disappeared. Anders 
was in a gray nothingness, a void. 
There was nothing around him 
except shapeless gray. 

Where was the voice? 

Gone. 

Anders perceived the delusion 
behind the grayness, and then 
there was nothing at all. 

Complete nothingness, and 
himself within it. 



84 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



W/-HERE was he? What did it 
mean? Anders’ mind tried to 
add it up. 

Impossible. That couldn’t be 
true. 

Again the score was tabulated, 
but Anders’ mind couldn’t accept 
the total. In desperation, the 
overloaded mind erased the fig- 
ures, eradicated the knowledge, 
erased itself. 

“Where am I?” 

In nothingness. Alone. 

Trapped. 

“Who am I?” 

A voice. 



The voice of Anders searched 
the nothingness, shouted, “Is 
there anyone here?” 

No answer. 

But there was someone. All di- 
rections were the same, yet 
moving along one he could make 
contact .* . with someone. The 
voice of Anders reached back to 
someone who could save him, 
perhaps. 

“Save me,” the voice said to 
Anders, lying fully dressed on 
his bed, except for his shoes and 
black bow tie.

Forecast 

Next month's lead, KINDERGARTEN by Clifford D. Simak, is almost long 
enough to be called a novella. However, it would take some term-stretching, 
which we won't do, so it's a novelet. A strong and emotionally urgent 
one, too, with the sort of alarming problem that somebody once stated 
as: “Beware of Greeks bearing gifts." That warning is no solution at all, 
of course— especially when the gifts are so desperately needed and seem 
to have no strings attached. Yet there must be strings! What are they and 
how much they will cost? 

On the other hand, William Morrison's THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 
seems to be a rollicking novelet . only it isn't. The trouble is that there 
are two practical jokers in it. One is a man and the other— well, when a 
planet turns practical joker, the gags are likely to be cosmic rather than 
comic. 

In SOLDIER BOY, Michael Shaara proves that it's one thing to laugh at 
a man whose occupation is useless and outmoded . and another thing 
when it suddenly isn't!

LADY

Terran Control specialized in nasty jobs, 
but the nastiest was taking a dazed young 




W E were just a few hours 
from Lotrin, and I look- 
ed at Shirley and Ellen 
and wondered how we were going 
to settle the problem in time. It 
wasn’t a life-and-death matter; 
probably none of us was going to 
die, whatever happened. It would 
be one way out, of course, for us 
all to commit suicide. But I 
couldn’t see any of us doing that, 
including Shirley, even if she 
knew what we knew. Suicide is 
never the answer to a problem, 
it’s only at best a compromise 
with it. 

We weren’t just looking at each 
other. We were talking, arguing, 
ranting, dramatizing. Ellen was 
doing the talking, arguing, rant- 
ing and dramatizing, now that 
she had to take an interest again 
in what was going on. Shirley 
was never a talker, and I’m a 
good listener. Besides, the prob- 
lem was less Ellen’s than it was 
Shirley’s and mine, and often the 
people who talk most are those 
who are least involved. 

I’m one of those people who 
always have an unconcerned, 
mildly interested alter ego, ob- 
serving what’s going on, sifting 
it, hauling up memories and com- 
paring the present with the past. 
I found it quite easy, while Ellen 
talked, to run rapidly through our 
whole association with Shirley, 
right from the beginning back on 
Earth. 



87 



OHE was expecting us, actually 
^ waiting for us, so there wasn’t 
much chance of our getting an in- 
formal look at her. On the way, 
Ellen was irritated, as usual. Be- 
ing Ellen, she was keeping me 
informed on her view of the situ- 
ation. She drove, keeping her eyes 
on the road, but throwing out oc- 
casional asides. 

“We aren’t just messengers,” 
she muttered. 

“Anyone at all would have 
done,” she grumbled. 

“We’ve never had to do any- 
thing I liked less,” she com- 
plained. 

Silently, I agreed with that, at 
least. 

We were Terran Control agents 
and we were doing a job that 
someone had to do. In itself, it 
was simple and rather boring, 
which was behind Ellen’s com- 
plaint that we weren’t just mes- 
sengers. But there was more than 
simplicity and boredom in it. 
Much more. The trouble was that 
we knew exactly what was in it. 
Sometimes we had been sent out, 
blind, to do very different jobs 
for TC, and we hadn’t liked that. 
This time we knew what we were 
doing and, if anything, we liked 
it less. 

“There are more important 
things we might be doing than 
escorting an overgrown schoolgirl 
to Lotrin,” Ellen beefed. 

I quoted ironically from the 



newscasts. “But what a girl,” I 
said nasally. “What a. history 
she’s going to have. What a life 
story she will one day be able to 
write.” 

“Save that for the great galac- 
tic public,” Ellen snapped. “Any- 
way, this girl is ordinary. Picked 
out because she’s ordinary, nor- 
mal, average, typical.” 

She drew up outside the small- 
town maisonette where the future 
First Lady of Lotrin lived. She 
stopped in her usual way, with a 
furious jerk of four locked 
wheels. She didn’t wait for me, 
but was out and crunching up 
the gravel path while the car was 
still rocking. 

We thought at first there was 
nobody home, and Ellen sneered 
something about cold feet. But 
when we went around the back, 
there was the girl, pretending not 
to see us. She was draped on a 
garden seat, wearing a playsuit 
and reading a book. 

“Just to show she doesn’t care,” 
said Ellen. 

Ellen, this once, was dead right. 
Shirley Judson — we’d seen pic- 
tures of her, and this was the 
girl, all right — was good-looking. 
Where she was just attractive, 
not beautiful, was where current 
standards of beauty deviated 
from the norm. Make no mistake 
about it, ^ there was nothing in 
Shirley’s looks to stop a million 
men from falling in love with her. 



88 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Yet Ellen muttered: “Not 

chosen for her looks, anyway.” 

I threw an expressive glance at 
her. Why will women insist on 
giving their worthless opinions of 
other women’s attractiveness or 
homeliness? It wasn’t a million 
women who were supposed to fall 
in love with Shirley. 

7E moved over to her and in- 
* * troduced ourselves. Shirley 
didn’t notice exactly when it be- 
came impossible to pretend any 
more that she hadn’t seen us, 
and give up the pretense, so I 
suppose technically it’s still going 
on yet. 

There was casual, pointless 
conversation — not about Lotrin. 
We didn’t bow and express our 
pleasure to meet the First Lady 
of Lotrin. In fact, just to make 
sure there was no misunderstand- 
ing, we put her very much in her 
place. At any rate, Ellen did. At 
first. 

Ellen always looks like some- 
thing straight out of Vogue, and 
in all modesty I can say I have 
seen worse-looking men of thirty- 
five than me. Shirley was a very 
young twenty-one, and her play- 
suit, as Ellen soon demonstrated 
to her without saying a word, 
was two mistakes. Wearing a 
playsuit was wrong, and wearing 
that particular playsuit was 
wronger. 

Shirley was keyed up almost 



to breaking-point, naturally 
enough. Her nostrils were white, 
she was breathing quickly and 
shallowly, and somehow one knew 
her voice was coming out two 
tones higher than usual. But that 
couldn’t be helped; the playsuit 
could. It had been meant to show 
she was completely at her ease, 
unimpressed by the solemnity of 
the occasion, and not in the least 
scared of us. It did pretty much 
the opposite. 

Instead of seeing the nervous- 
ness of her hands and face, four 
curious eyes noted the nervous- 
ness of her whole body. And the 
white frilly rompers suggested 
child when she wanted to be ma- 
ture and at no disadvantage with 
us. And if we wanted to be nasty, 
which Ellen nearly always does 
with other women, it was only 
necessary to look at Shirley’s legs 
or shoulders and then away, with 
faint distaste, to make it obvious 
that there was something wrong 
with the legs, or the display of 
them, without giving the girl any- 
thing she could answer. 

I haven’t covered everything, 
but you can imagine the general 
lines of the situation. Anyway, 
Ellen made the mo^t of it. I tried 
to counteract the effect a little, 
but no one has ever been able to 
counteract Ellen. 

Then suddenly, just as the girl 
was about to cry, Ellen said, “Joe, 
take a walk,” in an unexpectedly 



FIRST LADY 



89 



brisk tone, and jerked her head. 

Meekly, I went up the garden. 

I stopped where I could still 
see them, but not hear what they 
said. The funny thing about Ellen 
is that people don’t hate her the 
way they should. Other people 
strive hard for affection and don’t 
get it; Ellen seems to put in a lot 
of good solid work to be hated, 
only it doesn’t turn out that way,. 

She was very careful with 
Shirley, I saw, not even touching 
her at first. Then they were all 
over each other in that curious 
way women have. Shirley was 
crying by this time, of course. 
Her white shoulders and chestnut 
hair were mixed up with Ellen’s 
blue frock, and there was a tangle 
of bare arms and chic elbow- 
length gloves. 

And for some reason I had a 
lump in my throat. 

T WASN’T in the next part 
much. I wasn’t around be- 
cause Shirley spent most of the 
next two months in bra and 
panties or less, being poked and 
tapped by doctors, getting mas- 
sages, doing violent exercises and 
being checked and doublecheck- 
ed, slipping in and out of dresses, 
blouses, skirts, slacks and almost 
every other form of feminine at^ 
tire. 

One might have thought that 
clothes wouldn’t matter much to 
the First Lady of Lotrin, who 



would be literally the first woman 
to set foot on the planet, certain- 
ly the last for a long time, and 
possibly the last ever. But Shirley 
was going to represent her whole 
sex on Lotrin. She would have to 
be supremely feminine, and a 
few crates of clothes, even if they 
had to be transported hundreds 
of light-years at fabulous cost, as 
these would be, were not regarded 
by Terran Control as a luxury. 
They really weren’t for Shirley. 
They were for Lotrin. 

I wasn’t there, but Ellen was, 
so I naturally heard all about it. 
I heard the story of every exam- 
ination, every test, every check- 
up, every experiment; the details 
of Shirley’s trousseau were in- 
flicted on me. down to the last 
clip and lace curlicue. Ellen was 
bored with the whole business 
and she didn’t see why my being 
a man should excuse me from 
being bored with them, too. 

So if anyone wants to know 
anything at all about what hap- 
pens to a First Lady — any First 
Lady — before she leaves the New 
York TC center, just ask me. 
Nothing too minute, too intimate. 
The story of the testing and prep- 
aration and coaching and beauti- 
fying and swearing in and final 
passing of a First Lady is yours 
for the asking. 

Of course it isn’t very interest- 
ing. 

I haven’t said much about Ter-

ran Control. First of all, the name 
— it means control of everything 
from and by Earth. Some say 
it’s a clumsy and unworkable 
system, bound to fall apart 
eventually. Maybe it is, but it 
won’t collapse during this genera- 
tion or the next. Meantime, what 
TC says goes. And as far as 
Shirley was concerned, Ellen and 
I were TC; we represented it. 

I always say as little for or 
against TC as possible. This isn’t 
because my job depends on keep- 
ing my mouth shut. TC is an 
autocracy, but not that kind. 

When you’ve got a big job in 
hand, like, say, colonizing a gal- 
axy, there’s only one good way 
of doing it. Before you start, 
there may be plenty of ways. 
Again, if you start and fail, you 
may try another way. But, if you 
start and don’t fail, you have to 
keep on the way you began. I’m 
not going to argue about it; I’m 
just saying what I believe. 

/"\NE of the points of TC’s way 
was this: the human race 
must stay human. There have 
been enough civil wars without 
creating new races so that there 
can be new race wars. The Mar- 
tian War showed what can hap- 
pen when men become not-men 
and somewhere else men stay 
men. As it happened, the men 
won — there are no Martians left. 
There never will be Martians 



again while TC rules colonization. 
Humans can’t live on Mars and 
stay human. Mars is a plague 
spot, and the ruins of human 
habitation on the red planet 
crumble to dust. 

Venus is another matter. So 
are the Aldebaran worlds, and the 
other scattered worlds named for 
themselves, not their suns — Jenta, 
Smith, Babylon, Eyrie, Nostral, 
Hover, Gluckstein, Fortan, Jissel, 
Maple. Others, like Mars-r— Rob- 
inson, Dahlia, Mantor, Arka — are 
crossed out, forgotten names. 
Just plague spots. Dead, most of 
them. Some, unfortunately, are 
only dying. 

Others still — Civnet, Lotrin, 
Martin, Beckland, Everest, Red 
Dawn — have question marks after 
them. It takes a long time to re- 
move a question mark. But, 
broadly, the query begins to fade 
at a set point. After that a world 
may still turn out to be a plague 
spot, but that’s liable to be a 
gradual business. People can be 
taken out and settled elsewhere. 
Their strain will be watched, they 
may even be sterilized, but they 
will still be regarded as men. 

The set point is the birth of the 
first child conceived and deliver- 
ed on the world under study. 
Scientists and doctors do every- 
thing but take the poor kid to 
pieces. Then they deliver their 
verdict. They say go ahead, or go 
ahead cautiously, or wait a while, 



FIRST LADY

or hold everything, or stop, or . 

But no one likes to examine 
that end of the scale too closely. 

And that’s the main reason why 
the First Lady is so important. 
She’s the chosen mother of that 
first child. The father is chosen, 
too, of course. 

TC is matchmaker as well as 
godfather. 

Shirley and some Lotrin settler 
whose name I didn’t know were 
the future of Lotrin. The shape of 
Shirley’s life, and the destiny of 
a whole world, depended on a 
child she would have by a man 
she was going out to marry, but 
had never met. 

It was a queer situation, though 
not new any longer. The First 
Lady of Jenta was dead a long 
while; so was the First Lady of 
Smith. The First Lady of Baby- 
lon was over a hundred, and still, 
it was said, went for a swim in a 
mountain stream every morning. 
Eyrie’s First Lady was ninety- 
three. Nostral’s was not only 
First Lady, but President of Nos - 
tral as well. So on down to 
Maple’s First Lady, who could 
still wear a playsuit like Shirley’s, 
and to better effect, from what 
I’d been told. 

I’m not, if I can help it, going 
to say anything about the First 
Ladies of Robinson, Dahlia, Man- 
tor or Arka. 

I told you those places are 
plague spots. 



I T must have been that curious 
power of divination they call 
feminine intuition that made El- 
len call Shirley an overgrown 
schoolgirl before she had even 
met her, when she had only seen 
a photograph or two of the girl. 
For that’s what Shirley was. I 
don’t know whether TC has a 
definite pattern for the choice of 
First Ladies which includes an 
emotional maturity index; I 
haven’t met many First Ladies. 
But if there is a pattern, and 
Shirley fitted it, a First Lady 
must be rather shy, quiet, inex- 
perienced, above all virginal — 
an overgrown schoolgirl, as a 
matter of fact. 

One might have thought a 
First Lady should be dynamic, 
reckless, or a hundred per cent 
glamor. TC apparently didn’t 
agree. I don’t mean that Shirley 
was timid, incapable of reckless- 
ness, and sexless. She was — 
homy. One could see her as 
somebody’s sister, somebody’s 
girl friend, somebody’s wife. Not 
as an official, a TC agent like 
Ellen and me, a dancehall girl, 
an athlete. Not as anything that 
needed drive or responsibility or 
amorality. 

It’s difficult to describe Shirl- 
ey at all, because anything you 
say about her, you have to quali- 
fy. If you say she was shy, you 
have to add that she wasn’t very 
shy. And if she wasn’t brilliant, 



92 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you couldn’t describe her as 
stupid. 

Likewise, when she insisted on 
traveling incognito to avoid a 
great sendoff at New York, she 
could have been persuaded, and 
when the time came, I think she 
wished we hadn’t given in so 
easily. She would never seek the 
limelight, but when she found 
herself in it, she would be cap- 
able of enjoying it. 

There were no cheering crowds 
and reporters and photographers 
when we left from New York 
spaceport. Shirley was traveling 
as Ellen’s sister. She seemed to 
like the part. She had a crush on 
Ellen good and hard. 

TC was used to misleading the 
press. One might have thought 
some smart newsman would put 
two and two together and work 
out that since Lotrin’s First Lady 
was about due to go out, and 
since this ship, in the course of 
its four-month tour, was going to 
touch Lotrin, and since Shirley 
had most of the hallmarks of a 
First Lady, it might be worth 
investigating her a little. But TC 
announced officially that the 
First Lady wasn’t chosen yet, and 
circulated privately a rumor that 
she was chosen and would go on 
the next ship. 

The newspapermen rejected 
the statement and accepted the 
rumor. And if anyone checked 
over the passenger list of the 



Sardonia, he would have seen 
that we were going out to settle 
the Aldebaran section. 

OHIRLEY looked around with 
^ interest. “It’s a wonderful 
ship,” she said, gazing up at the 
smooth hull. 

“Is it?” murmured Ellen, ob- 
viously surprised that anyone 
should think it was wonderful. 
“Just wait till you get inside. 
You’ll find that every foot has 
only nine inches. You’ll get used 
to that, but when you reach the 
Moon, you’ll discover the foot 
has shrunk to seven inches. On 
the next tender it’ll be five, and 
when you’re on the liner it’ll 
come down to four.” 

Shirley stared at her. “Isn’t 
this the Sardonia ?” 

“Sometimes I wonder where 
you’ve been living these last 
twenty-one years. Tell her, Joe.” 

Pencil skirts were in again; El- 
len hobbled toward the tender. 
She could talk like that to Shirl- 
ey. If I tried it, the tears would 
come. I wondered how many gal- 
lons Shirley had wept since TC 
first found her. Most of them, ac- 
cording to Ellen, were about her 
mother, and they were usually 
down Ellen’s dress. 

“This is only a tender to take 
us to the Moon, Shirley,” I said. 
“Curiously, its power-to-weight 
ratio is much higher than that of 
the ship that will take us all those 



FIRST LADY 



93 



light-years. On the Moon there’ll 
be another check and another 
tender will take us to the Sar- 
donia, which by that time will be 
orbiting around the Moon.” 

I took Shirley’s arm and steer- 
ed her after Ellen. No one had 
any time for us; spaceships have 
no room for flunkeys. 

“The starships never land any- 
where,” I went on. “They’re as- 
sembled in space, and when, 
despite all the safeguards, they’re 
eventually saturated with radia- 
tion leakage, they’re destroyed 
in space.” 

“I can’t make you and Ellen 
out,” said Shirley suddenly, 
showing how much good my lec- 
turette for children had done. 
“Do yoii love her, Joe?” 

I grinned wryly. “Shirley, 
sometimes you’re too shy to say 
perfectly ordinary things, and 
other times you’re a little too 
frank. Outside of novels, people 
don’t go around asking people if 
they love other people.” 

“But do you,” she insisted, 
“since I’ve asked it?” 

“First define love,” I said. 
When you’ve done that to my 
satisfaction, ask me again. Then 
if you get an answer in the morn- 
ing, see if it’s the same answer in 
the afternoon, and the next day, 
and next week.” 

“You’re married, I suppose?” 
“Why should you suppose 
that?” 



She seemed taken back. “You 
are living together,” she said. 
“Aren’t you?” 

• “We certainly work together, 
but that doesn’t mean we’re mar- 
ried.” 

S HE was silent while we climb- 
ed to the airlock and began to 
sidle along the narrow passage. 

“I think I know what you are,” 
she said. “You’re secret agents. 
The way you don’t answer ques- 
tions shows you're used to it.” 
“That’s a point,” I said agree- 
ably. 

A few minutes later — it was a 
slow business moving along that 
passage — Shirley stated emphat- 
ically from behind me: “You’re 
Joe Dell and she’s Ellen Dell.” 
“That settles it, then,” I ob- 
served. “We must be married.” 
“Don’t you ever give a fact 
away., free?” 

I half turned and looked down 
at her reprovingly. “Weren’t you 
listening? I told you about the 
tenders and the Sardonia — ” 
“Which I could have got from 
the steward. He can’t tell me if 
you love Ellen.” 

“Well, that makes two of us,” 
I said easily. “Neither can I.” 
“You won't, anyway.” 

We had almost caught up with 
Ellen, and she stopped at that 
and waited. 

“He won’t what?” she asked. 
I was between them, so they 



94 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



could hardly see each other at 
all. Corridors on spaceships have 
to be seen to be believed. Ellen 
and Shirley might have passed 
each other, but only at the cost 
of buttons and tears and bruises, 
and that’s no exaggeration. If I 
had to pass anyone, we could 
only do it by climbing over each 
other. 

Shirley was silent. She was 
ready to ask questions of me, but 
not of Ellen. Not that kind of 
question. 

“It doesn’t matter,’’ I said, 
“since it’s settled that I won’t” 

Ellen accepted that, for the 
moment. She had found our room. 

“Yours is around the corner, 
Shirley,” she said. “Come and 
I’ll show you how things work.” 

I backed into the cabin to get 
out of the way, and they went 
past. Shirley gave me a last 
searching, puzzled glance. 

jC'ITTING into the routine of 
space travel again is always 
pretty much the same. Ellen 
made the same grumbles, phrased 
differently. This time she won- 
dered ironically why they didn’t 
feed us on condensed milk and 
shortbread and make sure we 
starved. Remarked that you rub- 
bed your head before you got up 
in anticipation of the bump. Said 
she realized at last why space - 
girls on magazine covers wore 
tights — they couldn’t squeeze 



through spaceship doors wearing 
anything else. Suggested we come 
to some arrangement whereby I 
breathed out when she breathed 
in. 

Shirley, to whom it was all new, 
took it very much for granted. 
That is, she noticed with surprise 
how little room there was, ad- 
justed herself to the new condi- 
tions and forgot the whole thing. 

When we were on the second 
tender, taking us out to the Sar- 
donia, I asked Ellen: “How much 
does Shirley know?’’ 

She didn’t feel like being sar- 
castic, for once, so she cut out 
everything but what I wanted to 
know. 

“Not much,” she said. “Shirley 
doesn't know she’a got to marry 
this character — let’s call him Bill. 
She thinks she does, but she 
doesn’t realize how absolutely in- 
escapable it is that she must mar- 
ry him and no one else. She 
doesn’t know that she must be 
kind — but not too kind — to the 
million others. No doubt she has 
her own ideas on that. What she 
doesn’t realize is that she must be 
the perfect, flawless figurehead, 
the dreamgirl, the model for all 
women, at once the vestal virgin, 
the perfect wife, everybody’s sis- 
ter, everybody’s sweetheart and 
everybody’s mother.” 

“I know what you mean,” I 
said. “Not everyone would.” 

“One thing,” Ellen observed. 



FIRST LADY 



95 



“she probably does realize. She 
knows about the baby.” 

I pressed my foot urgently 
against hers. 

“I suppose she knows,” Ellen 
went on reflectively, “that if it’s 
a monster, her whole future and 
Bill’s and Lotrin’s collapses. And 
not only collapses, but into a 
rather nasty little puddle. Yes, 
she probably knows that. I don’t 
think she’s really faced it, but 
who could? Certainly not me. I’ll 
stay in TC and be asked to do 
the impossible and get shot at 
and maybe beaten up occasion- 
ally. But I’m glad I’m a, few years 
too old to be asked to be a First 
Lady.” 

Shirley came right into the 
room. It had been a good touch 
on Ellen’s part to drop these 
hints about our normal employ- 
ment. Since neither of us had 
done anything of the sort before, 
it would convince Shirley that 
Ellen didn’t know she was there. 

Shirley was white, but strictly 
under control. 

“So you’re taking me to Lot- 
rin” she said clearly, “to do 
something you wouldn’t do your- 
self?” 

Ellen turned, and met her gaze. 
She didn’t look startled that 
Shirley had heard her; it would 
have been out of character, any- 
way. 

“That’s right, Shirley,” she 
said quietly. 



1 REALLY thought there was 
going to be a scene. It was all 
between Ellen and Shirley. It was 
Ellen whom Shirley worshiped, 
not me. I could see Shirley decid- 
ing that Ellen was false and ev- 
erything was, too, and you 
couldn’t trust anyone or anything. 
I saw her being ashamed of all 
the times she had cried before 
Ellen, who all the while had been 
thinking she was mad and a fool 
to be doing what she was doing. 

Then Shirley whirled and went 
out. 

“Better go after her, hadn’t 
you?” I said. 

“I’ve gone after her often 
enough.” 

“But she may . 

“She may do what?” 
“Anything. Kill herself.” 

“If she’s going to kill herself, 
she’d better do it now, not when 
she’s reached Lotrin and has 
actually been installed.” 

I was silent, thinking. Shirley 
wouldn’t kill herself, of course. 
Girls as delicately balanced as 
that would never be chosen as 
First Ladies. She would have 
much worse things to face than 
Ellen’s defection. 

I knew why Ellen had spoken 
as she had. Ellen was no part of 
Shirley’s life on Lotrin. If Shirl- 
ey was pinning a lot on Ellen and 
Ellen’s opinion of her and First 
Ladies in general, the sooner it 
was unpinned, the better. So 



96

Ellen tore it off. 

Besides, of course, Ellen was 
fed up playing nursemaid. 

“Just for curiosity,” I said, 
“when were you shot at in the line 
of duty?” 

“On Maple, fool. Don’t you re- 
member?” 

“Oh, that. But the shot was 
meant for me.” 

“A lot of difference that would 
have made to me if it killed me.” 

“And when were you last beat- 
en up?” 

“Nostral. When you were look- 
ing for the house.” 

I didn’t pursue that. On that 
occasion, Ellen certainly ran into 
my arms as she had never done 
before or since, and had stayed in 
bed for days afterward alleging 
nervous exhaustion. The thing 
about Ellen is that if she was 
nearly beaten up, she would talk 
about it at every opportunity, 
with all the details of what did 
happen and what might have hap- 
pened, but if she was beaten up, 
she would shut up like a clam. 

I filed away the conclusion that 
she had probably had a tough 
time on Nostral, and I hadn’t 
known about it before — it had 
happened two years ago — meant 
nothing. Not when you know the 
first thing about Ellen. 

I came back to what I thought 
was safer ground: “A few years 
too old?” 

“I’m twenty-five,” Ellen re- 



marked calmly. 

It wasn’t impossible, though 
that meant she was only eighteen 
when I first met her. Just unlike- 
ly. So I left it at that. It was un- 
like Ellen to give away even that 
much. Twenty years hence, I 
could say that according to her 
own figures she was now forty- 
five. 

But this isn’t the story of Ellen. 
Not directly, at any rate. 

VY7E hardly saw Shirley when 
** we were changing over to 
the Sardonia. Ellen’s attitude was 
that she had seen Shirley through 
the first part, and it was my turn 
now. She might have to take over 
again just before we reached Lot- 
rin and clear up the mess I had 
made, but meantime she was go- 
ing to have a rest from Shirley 
Judson. 

That’s Ellen. 

If anything was to be done 
about Shirley, I would have to 
do it. I waited until the ship was 
well clear of the Moon and then 
went to look for Shirley, whom 
we had only seen at mealtimes. 

The Sardonia was nosing about, 
stopping and darting like a fish. 
Passengers weren’t supposed to 
walk about at this stage. They 
were told to lie down or at least 
sit down. For the effect of the 
ship’s motion was that, one mo- 
ment, “down” was the floor, the 
next the left-hand wall, then the 



FIRST LADY 



97 



wall in front, then the wall be- 
hind. Of course it was never a full 
gravity; if you liked to take a 
chance, you could drop lightly on 
your feet on floor, walls and ceil- 
ing. The beds all swiveled with 
the changes in equilibrium. 

Apparently Shirley was taking 
her chance with the gravity, be- 
cause she wasn’t in her cabin. 

There was no room for social 
life on the Sardonia. The only 
place that held a fair number of 
people was the dining room, and, 
as the ship carried four hundred 
people, the dining room was on 
shift duty twenty-four hours a 
day. So, if Shirley wasn’t in her 
own '“room, she was in someone 
else’s. 

I considered the matter. Shirl- 
ey had had a shock. Torn from 
the life she had grown used to in 
twenty-one years, she had set up 
Ellen as her model and guide. El- 
len had allowed this until we were 
irrevocably on our way, then ab- 
dicated. What she had said was 
nothing; she could have won back 
Shirley’s adoration any time she 
cared, but she hadn’t bothered. 

What would Shirley do? She 
would feel nothing mattered. No- 
body cared. She might as well 
enjoy 'herself — show Ellen she 
didn’t care, either. In the limited 
field offered by the Sardonia, 
there was only one thing she 
could do. 

I considered some more. If 



Shirley was going to throw her- 
self at some man’s head, the 
likelihood was that it would be 
someone on the same meal shift, 
someone she had at least seen 
and talked to. I picked Glen 
Mavor. Mavor was a shy young- 
ster going out to Civnet to settle. 
Civnet, right on the outposts of 
Terran settlement, wasn’t near 
the First Lady stage yet. 

I sought out Mavor. I tapped 
on his door, but walked right in. 
I was right. Shirley was there, 
lounging against a wall. Mavor 
was sitting on the bed. When I 
came in, the place was crowded. 

“Hallo, Shirley,” I said. “I 
thought you might be here.” 

^T^HE SHIP made one of its 
sudden darts and Shirley and 
I somersaulted and landed on 
the ceiling, Shirley in a swirl of 
legs and skirt. She laughed. Mav- 
or didn’t have to move, because 
the bed kept its equilibrium. 

I saw the situation. Shirley 
was unconcerned, happy in a 
reckless way. Mavor was inter- 
ested, excited, but very nervous. 
He might not know the intra- 
cacies of the situation, but he 
knew he was going to a world 
which wouldn’t see a woman for 
a long time, and that Shirley 
was ready and willing to offer 
consolation in advance. 

This wasn’t the Shirley Judson 
we had met in the garden. This 



FIRST LADY 



99 



Shirley was more vital, and 
about twenty times as attractive, 
because now she was trying to 
be attractive. 

Innocence is an attitude of 
mind, not mere absence of experi- 
ence. Shirley now, arms behind 
her and head thrown back against 
the wall, was far from innocent. 
Nothing much had happened to 
her experience, but a lot to her 
attitude of mind. She had chosen 
a thin canary-yellow blouse for 
two obvious reasons, and her 
scarlet skirt hugged her waist 
and hips and then flared care- 
lessly, its work done. 

Shirley couldn’t go around like 
that for long looking for trouble 
without finding it. Something had 
to be done. 

“Mavor,” I said quietly, “I’m 
going to tell you a secret.” 

Mavor, a good-looking young 
fellow, glanced at Shirley, but 
she only smiled and surveyed 
her ankles. He turned back to 
me. 

“I don’t know if I want to hear 
any secrets,” he said. 

“This one you hear all the 
same. And you keep it. It doesn’t 
really matter now whether you 
keep it or not, but it would be 
more convenient if everyone on 
the ship didn’t know it just yet. 
Shirley, you see, is the First 
Lady of Lotrin.” 

I knew I had been right to tell 
him when I saw his expression. 



“I only mention it,” I said 
casually, “because when people 
are playing with dynamite, they 
at least ought to know it’s dyna- 
mite. Coming, Shirley?” 

There was another upheaval. 
This time Shirley landed on top 
of Mavor, her arms round his 
neck. It might have been an ac- 
cident, but it was no accident 
when she pulled his face to hers 
and kissed him. That wasn’t for 
Mavor’s benefit at all, but for 
mine. 

She disentangled herself at her 
leisure and followed me. I took 
her to her own room. 

“Why did you tell him that?” 
she asked. She didn’t mind*- she 
was just curious. 

“To keep him out of your 
way,” I said grimly. “He won’t 
touch you with a grappling pole 
now. He’s scared.” 

“Why?” 

“You don’t know much about 
TC, do you? It carries a lot of 
guns of different calibers. No one 
twists TC’s tail for fun.” 

“You mean Terran Control 
would victimize Glen?” 

“What for?” 

IT was a good question. It upset 
even the new, more confident 
Shirley. “I mean if . .” 

“If what?” I demanded. 

“Why shouldn’t I have a good 
time while I can, before I get to 
my prison?” 



100 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“Nothing against having a good 
time. Unless the form it takes 
might have an adverse effect on 
the future.” 

“I don’t care about the future. 
There may be no future.” 

We had reached her room. I 
passed it, pushed her inside and 
followed her in. We sat on the 
bed, where we could watch the 
gyrations of the walls with in- 
difference. 

“What’s the ship doing?” she 
abruptly wanted to know. 

“Looking for the rails,” I told 
her. I didn’t want to talk about 
the ship, but I was ready to play 
along with Shirley to a certain 
extent. 

“The rails?" 

“Sure. You know space travel 
is composed of two very different 
parts. Hoisting yourself free of a 
planet and then of a satellite of 
some kind, and then maneuvering 
about clumsily like this. The 
other part is as slick and wonder- 
ful as this is primitive and slow. 
At this rate, you’d take twenty 
thousand years to reach Alde- 
baran, let alone Lotrin.” 

“But it only takes a few 
weeks!” 

“That’s what I’m telling you,” 
I said patiently. “It’s slick and 
wonderful. There aren’t really 
any rails, of course, but it’s 
something like that. We’re look- 
ing for a field that starts about 
here and stretches all the way to 



Aldebaran. A beam. The Cat- 
terick Field, they call it. We’ve 
passed through it several times 
already — why we keep nosing 
about like this is that we have 
to be fair and square in the mid- 
dle of it, and it’s pretty tight. 
Only a few miles across.” 

“The ship isn’t a mile wide.” 
“No. But if there was the slight- 
est error, how many million 
miles would be needed to show 
it up? Ever hear of inertia, 
Shirley?” 

“That’s laziness.” 

“You can put it that way. The 
laziness of matter. When it’s 
still, matter can’t be bothered to 
move, and it’s a devil of a job to 
make it. And, when it’s moving, 
it can’t be bothered to make any 
effort to stop, and you have the 
same job all over again stopping 
it. 

“Now the Sardonia's engines 
generate enough power to take 
us to Lotrin in a few weeks with- 
out the Catterick Field — only 
the ship wouldn’t go with the 
engines at that acceleration. It 
would disintegrate. And at a frac- 
tion of that speed, we’d all be 
crushed to pulp. Just now, no 
acceleration of more than ten 
feet a second is being put on.” 

TT'OR demonstration purposes, 
I caught her by the waist, 
raised her against about a third 
Earth gravity and pushed her 



FIRST LADY 



101 



into the center of the room just as 
the ship shot one way and then 
another. 

“And that can be quite hectic,” 
I remarked, as Shirley bounced 
and somersaulted to the opposite 
wall. 

She had dressed for this sort of 
thing, I observed, with canary 
lingerie which was meant to make 
an interesting flurry as her legs 
thrashed about. I caught her un- 
ceremoniously by the waistband 
and hauled her back on the bed 
beside me. 

“Imagine what it would be like 
if the acceleration were ten miles 
a second,” I went on. “Or a thou- 
sand miles. Or ten thousand.” 

“I can’t,” she said truthfully. 

“Obviously, if you’re going to 
travel hundreds of light-years at 
a time, you’ve got to do some- 
thing about inertia. Suppose there 
were no inertia on Earth. That’s 
impossible actually, because the 
field only operates in a vacuum. 
But if it wasn’t, and gravity and 
air resistance remained the same, 
you could run at top speed from 
a standing start. If you wanted to 
turn and go back, you’d do it in 
one stride.” 

“Nonsense,” said Shirley, “you 
would strain a muscle or some- 
thing.” 

“No. That’s inertia. If you’re 
running at fifteen miles an hour 
and try to make your muscles 
stop you dead, certainly you’ll 



tear something. But if there’s no 
inertia, you could turn with one 
toe and be running the other way. 
Gravity and air resistance would 
not matter much. It’s inertia 
you’ve got to counter.” 

Shirley was tired of the whole 
subject and showed it. 

I went on grimly : “When we’re 
firmly in the center of this field, 
which is maintained from the 
Moon, by the way, we’ll start 
off with the Catterick Field en- 
ergized. Then there won’t be any 
gravity. No inertia. Only a trick- 
le let through so that we can 
still walk about, not a millionth 
of the real force. The ship will 
be able to start and stop in a 
split second. It won’t do more 
than a few hundred miles an hour 
at first, because we may still not 
be properly on the rails. When 
the captain’s satisfied we are, we’ll 
be off at the speed of light. Then 
bigger and bigger multiples of 
that till we reach Aldebaran. 
Then dead stop. We — ” 

“I’m going to have a shower,” 
Shirley announced. 

“You mean you want me to 
leave?” 

“Stay if you like, as long as 
you don’t go on gabbing about 
the Cat-whatever-it-is Field.” 
The shower was a minute cubi- 
cle in the opposite wall. There 
was no sink; if you wanted to 
wash, you had to take a whole 
shower. 



102

I might have told Shirley that 
I had seen and read and done a 
lot more than she had, and that 
if she really wanted to shock or 
upset me, she would have to go 
much further than she was ready 
to do — go around shooting people, 
for instance, or tampering with 
the engines, or trying to climb 
out into space. 

But that might give her ideas, 
and anyway she wanted me to 
protest. So I hoisted myself up 
and made for the door, knowing 
she didn’t really want to be left 
alone, with Glen Mavor almost 
certainly crossed off from now 
on. 

“See you later,” I said. 

OHIRLEY’S reckless phase fi z- 
^ zled out. Glen Mavor was 
crossed off and she wasn’t really 
sorry. She was fundamentally 
level-headed. She started speak- 
ing to Ellen again instead of ig- 
noring her when we ate. Ellen 
took her tentative advances as 
she had taken her resentment, 
calmly and without reference to 
the past. But the old adoration 
was gone. It was me Shirley ad- 
dressed most of her attention to, 
not Ellen. 

Time passes quickly when eve- 
ry day is the same, even more 
quickly when there is no day. We 
all slept about twelve hours out 
of twenty-four. Sustained exer- 
cise was almost impossible, and 



Ellen again had her usual worry 
about putting on weight. She did 
the usual thing about it — shut me 
out of the cabin and exercised 
grimly, deliberately, systematic- 
ally. She wouldn’t let anyone see 
her swinging her arms and pedal- 
ing on her back. Shirley was po- 
litely shown out, too, once or 
twice. 

“She saw me doing that sort of 
thing often enough,” Shirley ob- 
jected once. “Is she made differ- 
ently from other women, or 
what?” 

This was a far cry from her 
earlier worship of Ellen, which I 
thought was not a bad thing. 

“Oh, no,” I said. 

"She couldn’t have knock knees 
or a pot belly or anything?” 

“Nothing like that. She’ll sun- 
bathe in a swimsuit in the right 
surroundings, but only when she 
can be perfect. Ellen is the one 
perfect thing in a lot of imperfect 
worlds.” 

“Do you think she’s perfect?” 

“What I think doesn’t count. 
I meant can you imagine seeing 
Ellen touching her toes and 
swinging over to try to do it 
backward? You may know she’s 
doing it, but can you imagine 
seeing it?” 

She couldn’t. 

Shirley and I were thus thrown 
in each other’s company a lot. 
But we discovered a certain sim- 
ilarity in temperament with re- 



FIRST LADY 



103 



gard to passing time together 
which Ellen would never have 
understood. We would lounge 
comfortably in Shirley’s room 
reading or considering life or even 
dozing, without saying a word. 
We each had company, but we 
didn’t have to talk. 

And then Shirley finished that 
phase, too. I was reading a novel 
when she put her head between 
me and the book and kissed me. 

It may sound like a confession, 
but that really did startle me. 
Because when she did that, a lot 
of other things slipped into place. 

She had wanted to know, when 
we were just on our way, whether 
I loved Ellen. Whether we were 
married. She had quarreled with 
Ellen. She had let me stop an 
affair with Glen Mavor, and 
hadn’t seemed to care. She had 
tried to upset me, put me off 
stroke. She became catty about 
Ellen. She spent nearly all her 
waking hours in my company. 

J UST when my brain was about 
to take over once more, it was 
sent reeling again by the realiza- 
tion that Shirley wasn’t any more 
ready for this clinch than I was. 

That’s what they mean when 
they talk about love as a little- 
understood though prevalent dis- 
ease. I had no possible reason or 
excuse for falling for Shirley, I 
hadn’t meant to do it, it had 
never occurred to me that I could 



do it. And here we were. With 
Shirley in my arms, I wasn’t 
going to move or think, if I could 
help it, because, once the moment 
ended, I was going to have to face 
a lot of things I didn’t want to 
face. Shirley probably felt ex- 
actly the same. So we clung and 
felt our hearts beating together 
and tried to stop time. 

We succeeded no better than 
anyone ever has. I felt I was 
hurting Shirley and released my 
grip slightly. In turn, she took 
one arm from my neck and drop- 
ped it to my side. So, a little at 
a time, we broke it up. 

We pretended it was just one 
of those things that happen when 
you don’t actually take steps to 
prevent it, meaning little or noth- 
ing. We didn’t talk about it at 
all, and went on acting exactly as 
before. 

Except — perhaps I’m biased, 
but Shirley really seemed to be- 
come a hundred per cent prettier. 
I don’t think that’s bias, for Ellen 
remarked one day that she didn’t 
know why she’d once said Shirley 
wasn’t chosen for her looks, any- 
way. But it must have been bias 
that made me think Shirley was 
really quite intelligent and had 
good taste and could make a good 
TC agent. 

Still Shirley and I never talked 
about Lotrin. Until the very last 
day when the bubble burst. 

We were still untold light-years 



104 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



from Lotrin, but only a few hours. 
We had not, of course, landed 
anywhere; we stopped several 
times and tenders came out to the 
Sardonia, but that affected us not 
at all except that there were dif- 
ferent faces at mealtimes. 

Someone once said that the 
poor have large families because, 
cooped up in a small space, they 
haven’t much else to do. But 
Shirley and I, despite that one 
lapse, were so sure of ourselves 
that we spent nearly all our time 
together in a space no larger than 
a big cupboard. There was noth- 
ing of sex in our talk, and, though 
we couldn’t avoid touching each 
other accidentally, there was 
never a hint of sensuality in the 



contact between Shirley and me. 

fTiHAT day, Shirley was reading 
and I was sitting on the floor 
wondering what assignment Ellen 
and I would be given next — still 
in the determined pretense that 
this was just a job which would 
be over and all but forgotten very 
soon. I wondered again why TCV 
had given us the job of -taking 
Shirley out to Lotrin. But that 
was a train of thought that led 
in a direction I didn’t like, and 
I jerked my head as one does 
when in search of distraction — 
any distraction. 

Shirley’s red slipper caught my 
eye, which then drifted up her 
legs. Shirley had good legs, but 




her skirt was tucked modestly 
under her and I couldn’t even see 
to the knee. I was unreasonably 
irritated. Why did she have to 
pull her skirt about her like that? 
It was like shielding a letter from 
you as you passed, as if you were 
trying to read it. Uncalled for. I 
wasn’t sitting on the floor so that 
I could see her legs. I hadn’t even 
thought of her legs until I saw 
she was hiding them primly like 
a spinster. 

I reached out and touched 
Shirley’s ankle, but, at the touch, 
anything I’d had in mind went 
away abruptly. She threw aside 
her book and slid down into my 
arms. 

We petted like teen-age lovers, 
just as nervous and excited. Sud- 
denly Shirley threw herself back, 
eyes closed, waiting. 

And it had exactly the opposite 
effect on me of what it was sup- 
posed to have. 

"Look, Shirley,” I said harsh- 
ly. “This is an impossible situa- 
tion.” 

She sat up, her back against 
the bed. 

“Don’t you know what a First 
Lady is?” I demanded. “She’s a 
symbol. A goddess. A whole new 
world depends on her, loves her 
and would die for her. She’s more 
of a sovereign than any queen in 
history.” 

“Lotrin can have another First 
Lady,” said Shirley sharply. “I’m 



going to abdicate right away.” 
“You can't. Weeks ago, it was 
disclosed on Earth that the First 
Lady of Lotrin was Shirley Jud- 
son, who was on her way there. 
It hasn’t anything like the im- 
portance to Earth that it has to 
Lotrin, but it’s known. It can’t 
be hushed up. Suppose you go 
back. Lotrin will hear the story 
eventually. Some other girl goes 
— a second-best, not the real 
First Lady, a substitute for a 
failure or a coward. What chance 
will she have? Suppose TC covers 
up and sends out another girl as 
Shirley Judson with some story 
to explain the delay. She’ll know. 
She’d have to be the best actress 
in the Galaxy to keep up the pre- 
tense all the rest of her life.” 
“Why didn’t you think of that 
before?” 

“I knew it all along.” 

“Nobody can make me be a 
good First Lady. I can ruin Lot- 
rin. I would.” 

“Ruin a world because you 
didn’t get your own way? Because 
you went back on your word?” 

W E were both being unfair, of 
course. We went around in 
circles for a while longer, blaming 
everything on each other, but not 
in hot anger — rather with a sort 
of hopeless knowledge that what 
I had said was true. 

The TC colonization system is 
all built into a solid pyramid. At 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the bottom are the real pioneers, 
the men who take a chance on 
death or glory, poverty or fabu- 
lous wealth. They go to a world 
and shape it into a place for men 
to live. As time goes by and they 
prosper, there are more and more 
of them. A hundred men, a thou- 
sand, a hundred thousand. But 
no women. Everybody knows 
that. It’s accepted. 

Every new world may be life- 
blood or canker. If the canker 
ever has to be cut out, it must be 
possible to do it cleanly and 
completely. No women. The 
world settled, examined, explored, 
tested, tried out in every way. 
Early diseases and allergies and 
maladies conquered. Five hun- 
dred thousand men, a million. 

And no women. TC controls 
all space travel, not only inter- 
stellar travel. No woman can 
possibly reach a virgin world. 

Then the First Lady. The real 
beginning. Recognition. Reward. 
Promise. Hope. 

That’s one side. 

The other side is that if the 
world turns out to be canker, the 
First Lady can easily be steril- 
ized, along with the unfortunate 
child, if it happens to be female. 
That’s the end. The world must 
die, for there are no more women. 
Everybody knows and accepts 
that, too. 

It’s a crazy structure of luck 
and fear and wild hope, but a 



solid structure. I could no more 
buck it than Shirley could. She 
was Lotrin’s First Lady and there 
was no escape. 

But Shirley and I weren’t real- 
ly considering the issues, only 
toying with them. When I saw 
that, I said: “Let’s get Ellen in 
on this.” 

Shirley jumped. “Are you 
mad?” 

When we had been pretending 
to ourselves and to each other 
that we had merely been carried 
away once by the heat of the 
moment, we had naturally pre- 
tended very hard to Ellen that 
not even that had ever happened. 

“She’s got to come into this,” 
I said, “unless we can decide 
here and now that you and I are 
finished with each other.” 

I hoped Shirley would say we 
could. I was afraid she might say 
it. She s^iid nothing. 

So I said, “Stay here,” and 
went for Ellen. 

T DIDN’T even knock. Ellen’s 
arms were above her head, 
swinging one way and then the 
other. She dropped her arms and 
looked at me in fury. 

“It’s important,” I said. “Shirl- 
ey and I need your help. Never 
mind making yourself smart. Just 
come.” 

I didn’t tell her anything until 
we were wedged in Shirley’s 
room. Then I told her that Shirl- 



FIRST LADY 



107 



ey and I were in love. Ellen’s 
frown cleared away as if by 
magic. This was interesting. It 
was a break in routine. It was a 
problem, a challenge. 

But she couldn’t help sighing 
and saying: “I knew something 
would happen when I stopped 
running the show. I didn’t know 
it would be this. I don’t know 
everything.” 

“You think you do,” Shirley 
flashed. 

Ellen turned a cold eye on her. 
“Is that attitude going to help?” 
she asked. “Aren't you just put- 
ting it on to show you’ve out- 
grown your childish crush on 
me?” 

That was meant to make Shirl- 
ey about two inches high. It fail- 
ed because Shirley knew she was 
somebody. Merely being a First 
Lady was nothing, but now she 
had someone in love with her. 

“I’m not ashamed that I once 
thought you were wonderful,” she 
retorted. “You’re a great actress. 
You can even act the part of a 
decent human being.” 

Ellen smiled. That smile show- 
ed Ellen’s real talent. Come to 
think of it, Shirley was right. 
That’s what Ellen is above all 
else — an actress — the kind I’d 
been talking about. 

“That’s not hard.” she said 
quietly. “Honestly, Shirley, have 
you ever met anyone who wasn’t 
basically a decent human being?” 



Shirley hadn’t. That was her 
good luck; it was like Ellen to 
play on it. 

“Now let’s get the position 
clear,” Ellen went on. “Is it set- 
tled that Shirley isn’t going to be 
Lotrin’s First Lady, and what 
we’re looking for is some way 
out of it?” 

N obody spoke. “Well, let’s 
make up our minds,” Ellen 
insisted pleasantly, after a long 
pause. “Shirley, think about your 
mother.” 

“That’s you all over!” Shirley 
burst out. “Any weapon — any- 
thing’s fair to you! It’s not safe 
for anyone to have feelings, be- 
cause you’ll twist them and use 
them against them — ” 

“All right, don’t think about 
your mother. Count her out of it. 
You’ve already made up your 
mind that you’ll probably never 
see her again, anyway.” 

There was another long silence. 
Then Shirley said: “Suppose I 
think about her. What am I sup- 
posed to think?” 

“You were an ordinary girl, 
quite happy on Earth, content 
to stay there. Some TC men 
came along and talked to you, 
persuaded you to take a few tests, 
and then threw their bombshell. 
You could be important. You 
could rule a whole planet of men. 
Only it meant leaving Earth, 
leaving your mother, and the 



108 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



answer had to be yes or no, not 
maybe.” 

“They made me go!” 

“They would be persistent, I 
admit. First Ladies don’t grow on 
trees. But did you really believe 
you couldn’t say no?” 

No answer. 

“Well, you could be some- 
body,” Ellen continued reflective- 
ly, “or you could give up the 
chance. You love your mother. 
You didn’t want to leave her. 
You thought of giving it up. You 
didn’t, as history will bear out, 
really care about space and prog- 
ress and mankind and all the big 
things like that. People don’t, 
though it makes a good story. 
The real question was, could you 
give up an opportunity like 
that?” 

In case by any chance I haven’t 
said so before — Ellen has person- 
ality. She had both of us hanging 
on her words. Me a little less 
than Shirley, of course, but still 
enough. 

“You couldn’t,” said Ellen, 
“There were things you had to 
give up, a lot of things. Things 
I don’t know about. Things no 
one but you will ever know 
about.” 

I saw what was coming. I had 
been long enough seeing it; but, 
then, I had been pretty unreason- 
able in a lot of^ways lately. 

“Never mind whether it’s pos- 
sible or not,” said Ellen. 



“The question’s still the same. 
Are you going to give up the 
things you have to give up to be 
a First Lady? Or are you going 
to give up being a First Lady?” 
“I’m not going to give up Joe,” 
declared Shirley defiantly. 

Ellen nodded as if that was 
perfectly reasonable. “All right. 
The question is, then, have you 
got Joe?” She looked at me. 

I avoided her eye. “You won’t 
understand' this,” I said, “but I 
have really fallen for Shirley.” 
“Oh, I understand that, all 
right. Do you see any future in 
it?” 

“I’ve already told Shirley that 
I don’t.” 

“I’ve tried to be fair to Shirley,” 
Ellen said, “but I can be a lot 
tougher with you and still be 
fair. You know better.” 

I might have known that when 
I went to Ellen with a problem, 
she would throw it right back in 
my lap. 

HDHE real difference between 
Shirley and me wasn’t age or 
sex, but the fact that I knew TC. 
I wanted Shirley and I’d have 
moved Heaven and Earth for her. 
But I knew I couldn’t move TC. 

I had one last doomed try. 
“You talk about Shirley giving 
up a chance, Ellen. A chance to 
be a tragic queen? Suppose Lot- 
rin won’t support human life and 
let it stay human. Wouldn’t she 



FIRST LADY 



109 



be better off — if she — ” 

“Cut it out,” retorted Ellen. 
She turned to Shirley. “Listen, 
Shirley, Joe’s doing this because 
he’s a fool. He can’t help that. 
It’s too late to do anything about 
Joe. But you’re doing it because 
you’re afraid. At the last mo- 
ment, only a few hours from Lot- 
rin, you suspect you can’t face 
what may happen there.” 

“You admitted you couldn’t 
either,” said Shirley. 

“I didn’t say I could. You did, 
so leave me out of it. Knowing 
you’re alone, you turned to Joe, 
who’s a fool, and made your 
problem his. I’m a woman, too, 
remember — I know the technique. 
You were afraid and Joe was 
around and, after all, you were 
picked out for a whole world to 
fall in love with — not only Joe, 
who’s a fool. I don’t blame you. 
You did a good job, helped by 
the fact that I was too busy with 
something else to have any time 
for either of you. And it was left 
to Joe, who’s a fool, to find a way 
out for both of you. Joe — ” 
“Who’s a fool,” I supplied. 
Ellen made an impatient ges- 
ture. “Joe should have told you 
something. TC should have told 
you. But now I’ll tell you. 

“Shirley, TC has the best 
brains of all humanity. Not run- 
ning things, but finding out facts. 
The best scientific brains. 

“Listen, Shirley, this is impor- 



tant. In a sense, nearly every First 
Lady is a sham. Yes, you’re 
meant to go to Lotrin and have 
a baby, and doctors and scientists 
and psychologists will very hon- 
estly and thoroughly test it for 
any deviation from the human 
norm. But do you really think 
TC needs that?” 

This, as they say, was the pay- 
off. At the back of my mind, I 
had known when I went for Ellen 
that she would tell Shirley at 
least some of the truth. But I had 
hoped that the thing could be 
worked out some other way. 

Ellen didn't need to play for 
effect now. Shirley was rigid with 
attention. 

Ellen shook her head. “No, 
Shirley, the people who examine 
the world before it’s colonized 
may not be sure what it will do 
to men, but after a few thousand 
have lived on a world for a year, 
and a hundred thousand or so 
for years, and a million are finally 
settled there, the scientists know 
a lot more about’ the place and its 
effect on human physical struc- 
ture than any single experiment 
can tell them. You know a First 
Lady is a symbol. Well, that also 
applies to the test. The first birth. 

“TC knows already what it’s 
going to show. TC always knows. 
But, so long as people are 
unreasonable and superstitious 
and unscientific and emotionally 
immature, this symbolic test will 



110 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



be needed. The proof that a 
world is safe or unsafe. 

“But it isn’t proof to TC. It’s 
confirmation of more than a nine- 
ty per cent probability, which is 
reasonable certainty in your lan- 
guage and mine. You can see that, 
can’t you? Doesn’t it make 
sense?” 

"Yes,” Shirley grudgingly ad- 
mitted. 

“And you want to know about 
Lotrin. Well, even you couldn’t 
be told. And, now that I’m telling 
you, listen and keep it to your- 
self. The whole TC system is built 
on the First Ladies. Don’t even 
tell Bill, or whatever his name 
turns out to be. He doesn’t know. 
Nobody knows but TC. 

“You were never in any danger, 
Shirley. Lotrin is safe. Your child 
will be like any other woman’s 
child on any human world. I tell 
you TC knows. Now are you go- 
ing to cling to Joe?” 

¥ actually landed with Shirley. 

Ellen couldn’t because the 
First Lady regulations were in- 
flexible. No woman could even 
visit a world like Lotrin for as 
much as five minutes, except the 
First Lady. 

I saw what Shirley’s arrival did 
to the place. Alextown was the 
main population center of Lotrin, 
and literally every inhabitant was 
there to welcome her. I can’t de- 
scribe the scene — you would 



think I was mad. 

Have you ever seen or heard 
what a flag or a cross or just a 
sign can do to people living in the 
valley between life and death? 

Well, imagine the symbol isn’t 
a flag or a cross or just a sign, 
but a living, breathing, beautiful 
girl in a world which no woman 
has ever trod. 

And still you won’t be within 
light-years of the reality. 

When I said good-by to her, 
she had to make an obvious effort 
to bring her attention back to me. 
It wasn’t that her thinking herself 
in love with me had been as light 
and casual and false as all that. 
I was already just an episode in 
an entirely irrelevant past, and it 
didn’t matter in the least how 
important an episode I had been. 

Ellen was waiting when I got 
back to the Sardonia — waiting, 
apparently, to look into my eyes. 

“I don’t know how I got 
through it,” I said dully. 

“I don’t know, either,” Ellen 
confessed with that incredible 
sympathy of hers which had won 
Shirley twice. “Let me say it first, 
Joe. This is the last time we ever 
do anything like this.” 

“It’s the last time for every- 
one. That’s why we got the job, 
because no one will ever do it 
twice. And there can only be a 
few human beings in any genera- 
tion foul enough to do it once.” 

All of what Ellen had told 



FIRST LADY 



111 



Shirley was true except the end. 

TC naturally did know what 
was going to happen before the 
First Lady went out. Not long 
before — not until the world was 
pretty fully colonized and there 
was a lot of data to work on. We 
knew before we saw Shirley. 
We hadn’t like th£ job, but we 
agreed it was necessary. Lotrin 
still had to have a First Lady. 
Colonists who had worked and 
sweated and slaved to build a 
new world wouldn’t believe a 
test tube. They wouldn’t listen 
calmly when they were told there 
could be no more colonists and 
their world was condemned with- 
out the real test. 

But they would believe their 
own eyes when they saw Shirley’s 
child. Ellen had told it the wrong 
way around. 

S HIRLEY had believed I had 
fallen in love with her because 
a woman is always ready to be- 
lieve that of any man. She 
couldn’t guess that the real reason 
was that I couldn’t go on spend- 
ing so much time with her and 
getting to know her without being 
so damn sorry for her that — 

No, Ellen was no worse than 
me. She told the lie, but I acted 
it. 

“It isn’t ninety per cent, of 
course,’’ Ellen reminded me. 
“Only about seventy-five. There 
is a chance . .” 



I nearly demanded, “Would 
you take it?’’ But I didn’t. She 
would. Yes, Ellen would take 
one chance in four, for a world. 
It had been another lie when she 
told Shirley she wouldn’t — a 
devious lie to rid Ellen of Shirl- 
ey’s affection before Ellen had to 
return it. 

So it wasn’t too bad really, I 
tried to convince myself. Ellen 
would do it. Ellen, my wife. 

I also tried to interest myself 
again in the fact that Ellen was 
one of the most beautiful women 
ever born. That was why people 
loved her against all reason, I 
told myself. I didn’t often admit 
it, but Ellen was . 

When I looked at Ellen, though, 
gazing silently at me, all I could 
see was Shirley’s face.

We Don't Want Any Trouble 

By JAMES H. SCHMITZ 



Illustrated by EMSH 



“W: 



'"ELL, that wasn't a 
very long interview, 
was it?” asked the 
professor’s wife. She’d discovered 
the professor looking out of the 
living room window when she’d 



come home from shopping just 
now. “I wasn’t counting on hav- 
ing dinner before nine,” she said, 
setting her bundles down on the 
couch. “I’ll get at it right away.” 
“No hurry about dinner,” the 



WE DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE

professor replied without turning 
his head. “I didn’t expect we’d 
be through there before eight my- 
self.” 

He had clasped his hands on 
his back and was swaying slow- 
ly, backward and forward on his 
feet, staring out at the street. It 
was a favorite pose of his, and she 
never had discovered whether it 
indicated deep thought or just 
daydreaming. At the moment, she 
suspected uncomfortably it was 
very deep thought, indeed. She 
took off her hat. 

“I suppose you could call it an 
interview,” she said uneasily. “I 
mean you actually talked with it, 
didn’t you?” 

“Oh, yes, we talked with it,” 
he nodded. “Some of the others 
did, anyway.” 

“Imagine talking with some- 
thing like that! It really is 
from another world, Clive?” She 
laughed uneasily, watching the 
back of his head with frightened 
eyes. “But, of course, you can’t 
violate the security rules, can 
you? You can’t tell me anything 
about it at all . 

TTE shrugged, turning around. 
Xi “There’ll be a newscast at 
six o’clock. In ten minutes. Wher- 
ever there’s a radio or television 
set on Earth, everybody will hear 
what we found out in that inter- 
view. Perhaps not quite every- 
thing, but almost everything.” 



“Oh?” she said in a surprised, 
small voice. She looked at him in 
silence for a moment, her eyes 
growing more frightened. “Why 
would they do a thing like that?” 
“Well,” said the professor, “it 
seemed like the right thing to do. 
The best thing, at any rate. There 
may be some panic, of course.” 
He turned back to the window 
and gazed out on the street, as if 
something there were holding his 
attention. He looked thoughtful 
and abstracted, she decided. But 
then a better word came to her, 
and it was “resigned.” 

“Clive,” she said, almost des- 
perately, “what happened?” 

He frowned absently at her and 
walked to the radio. It began to 
make faint, humming noises as 
the professor adjusted dials un- 
hurriedly. The humming didn’t 
vary much. 

“They’ve cleared the networks, 
I imagine,” he remarked. 

The sentence went on repeating 
itself in his wife’s mind, with no 
particular significance at first. 
But then a meaning came into it 
and grew and swelled swiftly, un- 
til she felt her head would burst 
with it. They’ve cleared the net-' 
works. All over the world this 
evening, they’ve cleared the net- 
works. Until the newscast comes 
on at six o’clock . 

“As to what happened,” she 
heard her husband’s voice saying, 
“that’s a little difficult to under- 



114 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



stand or explain. Even now. It 
was certainly amazing — ” He in- 
terrupted himself. “Do you re- 
member Milt Caldwell, dear?” 
“Milt Caldwell?” She searched 
her mind blankly. “No,” she said, 
shaking her head. 

“A rather well-known anthro- 
pologist,” the professor informed 
her, with an air of faint reproach. 
“Milt got himself lost in the ap- 
proximate center of the Austra- 
lian deserts some two years ago. 
Only we have been told he didn't 
get lost. They picked him up — ” 
"They?” she said. “You mean 
there’s more than one?” 

“Well, there would be more 
than one, wouldn’t there?” he 
asked reasonably. “That explains, 
at any rate, how they learned to 
speak English. It made it seem 
a little more reasonable, any- 
how,” he added, “when it told us 
that. Seven minutes to six . .” 
“What?” she said faintly. 
“Seven minutes to six,” the 
professor repeated. “Sit down, 
dear. I believe I can tell you, in 
seven minutes, approximately 
what occurred . .” 

HDHE Visitor from Outside sat 
•*- in its cage, its large gray hands 
slackly clasping the bars. Its at- 
titudes and motions, the profes- 
sor had noted in the two minutes 
since he had entered the room 
with the other men, approximat- 
ed those of a rather heavily built 



ape. Reporters had called it “the 
Toad from Mars,” on the basis 
of the first descriptions they’d 
had of it — the flabby shape and 
loose, warty skin made that a 
vaguely adequate identification. 
The round, homy head almost 
could have been that of a lizard. 

With a zoologist’s fascination 
in a completely new genus, the 
professor catalogued these con- 
tradicting physical details in his 
mind. Yet something somewhat 
like this might have been evolved 
on Earth, if Earth had chosen to 
let the big amphibians of its Car- 
boniferous Period go on evolving. 

That this creature used human 
speech was the only almost-im- 
possible feature. 

It had spoken as they came in. 
“What do you wish to know?” it 
asked. The horny, toothed jaws 
moved, and a broad yellow 
tongue became momentarily vis- 
ible, forming the words. It was a 
throaty, deliberate “human” 
voice. 

For a period of several seconds, 
the human beings seemed to be 
shocked into silence by it, though 
they had known the creature had 
this ability. Hesitantly, then the 
questioning began. 

The professor remained near 
the back of the room, watching. 
For a while, the questions and 
replies he heard seemed to carry 
no meaning to him. Abruptly he 
realized that his thoughts were 



WE DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE 



115 



fogged over with a heavy, cold, 
physical dread of this alien ani r 
mal. He told himself that under 
such circumstances fear was not 
an entirely irrational emotion, 
and his understanding of it seem- 
ed to lighten its effects a little. 

But the scene remained unreal 
to him, like a badly lit stage on 
which the creature in its glitter- 
ing steel cage stood out in sharp 
focus, while the humans were 
shadow-shapes stirring restlessly 
against a darkened background. 

“This won’t do!” he addressed 
himself, almost querulously, 
through the fear. “I’m here to 
observe, to conclude, to report — 
I was selected as a man they 
could trust to think and act ra- 
tionally!” 

He turned his attention deliber- 
ately away from the cage and 
what it contained, and directed it 
on the other human beings, to 
most of whom he had been intro- 
duced only a few minutes before. 
A young, alert-looking Intelli- 
gence major who was in some 
way in charge of this investiga- 
tion; a sleepy-eyed general; a 
very pretty Wac captain acting 
as stenographer, whom the ma- 
jor had introduced as his fiancee. 
The handful of other scientists 
looked for the most part like 
brisk business executives, while 
the two Important Personages 
representing the Government 
looked like elderly professors. 



He almost smiled. They were 
real enough. This was a human 
world. He returned his attention 
again to the solitary intruder in 
it. 

“W HY shouldn’t I object?” 
the impossible voice was 
saying with a note of lazy good- 
humor. "You’ve caged me like — 
a wild animal! And you haven’t 
even informed me of the nature 
of the charges against me. Tres- 
passing, perhaps — eh?” 

The wide mouth seemed to grin 
as the thing turned its head, look- 
ing them over one by one with 
bright black eyes. The grin was 
meaningless; it was the way the 
lipless jaws set when the mouth 
was closed. But it gave expres- 
sion to the pleased malice the 
professor sensed in the voice and 
words. 

The voice simply did not go 
with that squat animal shape. 

Fear surged up in him again. 
He found himself shaking. 

If it looks at me now, he real- 
ized in sudden panic, I might 
start to scream! 

One of the men nearest the 
cage was saying something in 
low, even tones. The Wac cap- 
tain flipped over a page of her 
shorthand pad and went on writ- 
ing, her blonde head tilted to one 
side. She was a little pale, but 
intent on her work. He had a 
moment of bitter envy for their 



116 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



courage and self-control. But 
they’re insensitive, he tried to tell 
himself; they don’t know Nature 
and the laws of Nature. They 
can’t feel as I do how wrong all 
this is! 

Then the black eyes swung 
around and looked at him. 

Instantly, his mind stretched 
taut wi£h blank, wordless terror. 
He did not move, but afterward 
he knew he did not faint only be- 
cause he would have looked ri- 
diculous before the others, and 
particularly in the presence of a 
young woman. He heard the 
young Intelligence officer speak- 
ing sharply ; the eyes left him un- 
hurriedly, and it was all over. 

“V7'OU indicate,” the creature’s 
voice was addressing the ma- 
jor, “that you can force me to 
reveal matters I do not choose to 
reveal at this time. However, you 
are mistaken. For one thing, a 
body of this type does not react 
to any of yotfPdrugs.” 

“It will react to pain!” the ma- 
jor said, his voice thin and angry. 

Amazed by the words, the pro- 
fessor realized for the first time 
that he was not the only one in 
whom this being’s presence had 
aroused primitive, irrational 
fears. The other men had stirred 
restlessly at the major’s threat, 
but they made no protest. 

The thing remained silent for 

a moment, looking at the major. 



“This body will react to pain,” 
it said then, “only when I choose 
to let it feel pain. Some you here 
know the effectiveness of hyp- 
notic blocks against pain. My 
methods are not those of hyp- 
nosis, but they are considerably 
more effective. I repeat, then, that 
for me there is no pain, unless I 
choose to experience it.” 

“Do you choose to experience 
the destruction of your body’s 
tissues?” the major inquired, a 
little shrilly. 

The Wac captain looked up at 
him quickly from the chair where 
she sat, but the professor could 
not see her expression. Nobody 
else moved. 

The thing, still staring at the 
major, almost shrugged. 

“And do you choose to experi- 
ence death?” the major cried, his 
face flushed with excitement. 

In a flash of insight, the pro- 
fessor understood why no one was 
interfering. Each in his own way, 
they had felt what he was feel- 
ing: that here was something so 
outrageously strange and new 
that no amount of experience, no 
rank, could guide a human being 
in determining how to deal with 
it. The major was dealing with 
it — in however awkward a fash- 
ion. With no other solution to 
offer, they were, for the moment, 
unable or unwilling to stop him. 

The thing then said slowly and 
flatly, “Death is an experience I 



WE DON'T WANT ANY TROUBLE 



117 



shall never have at your hands. 
That is a warning. I shall respond 
to no more of your threats. I 
shall answer no more questions. 

“Instead, I shall tell you what 
will occur now. I shall inform my 
companions that you are as we 
judged you to be — foolish, lim- 
ited, incapable of harming the 
least of us. Your world and civi- 
lization are of very moderate in- 
terest. But they are a novelty 
which many will wish to view for 
themselves. We shall come here 
and leave here, as we please. If 
you attempt to interfere again 
with any of us, it will be to your 
own regret.” 

“Will it?” the major shouted, 
shaking. “Will it now?” 

The professor jerked violently 
at the quick successive reports of 
a gun in the young officer’s hand. 
Then there was a struggling knot 
of figures around the major, and 
another man’s voice was shouting 
hoarsely, “You fool! You damned 
hysterical fool!*’ 

The Wac captain had dropped 
her notebook and clasped her 
hands to her face. For an instant, 
the professor heard her crying, 
“Jack! Jack! Stop— don’t — ■” 

But he was looking at the thing 
that had fallen on its back in the 
cage, with the top of its skull shot 
away and a dark-brown liquid 
staining the cage floor about its 
shoulders. 

What he felt was an irrational 



satisfaction, a warm glow of pride 
in the major’s action. It was as 
if he had killed the thing himself. 

For that moment, he was 
happy. 

¥>ECAUSE he stood far back 
-■-* in the room, he saw what 
happened then before the others 
did. 

One of the Personages and two 
of the scientists were moving ex- 
citedly about the cage, staring 
down at the thing. The others 
had grouped around the chair 
into which they had forced the 
major. Under the babble of con- 
fused, angry voices, he could 
sense the undercurrent of almost 
joyful relief he felt himself. 

The Wac captain stood up and 
began to take off her clothes. 

She did it quickly and quietly. 
It was at this moment, the pro- 
fessor thought, staring at her in 
renewed terror, that the height of 
insanity appeared to have been 
achieved in this room. He wished 
fervently that he could keep that 
sense of insanity wrapped around 
him forevermore, like a protec- 
tive cloak. It was a terrible thing 
to be rational! With oddly de- 
tached curiosity, he also won- 
dered what would happen in a 
few seconds when the others dis- 
covered what he already knew. 

The babbling voices of the 
group that had overpowered the 
major went suddenly still. The 



118 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



three men at the cage turned 
startled faces toward the stillness. 
The girl straightened up and 
stood smiling at them. 

The major began screaming 
her name. 

There was another brief strug- 
gling confusion about the chair 
in which they were holding him. 
The screaming grew muffled as 
if somebody had clapped a hand 
over his mouth. 

“I warned you,” the professor 
heard the girl say clearly, “that 
there was no death. Not for us.” 

Somebody shouted something 
at her, like a despairing question. 
Rigid with fear, his own blood a 
swirling roar in his ears, the pro- 
fessor did not understand the 
words. But he understood her 
reply. 

“It could have been any of 
you, of course,” she nodded. “But 
I just happened to like this 
body.” 

After that, there was one more 
shot. 

HHHE professor turned off the 
radio. For a time, he contin- 
ued to gaze out the window. 

“Well, they know it now!” he 
said. “The world knows it now. 
Whether they believe it or not — 
At any rate . .” His voice trailed 
off. The living room had dark- 
ened and he had a notion to 
switch on the lights, but decided 
against it. The evening gloom 



provided an illusion of security. 

He looked down at the pale 
oval of his wife’s face, almost fea- 
tureless in the shadows. 

“It won’t be too bad,” he ex- 
plained, “if not too many of them 
come. Of course, we don’t know 
how many there are of them, ac- 
tually. Billions, perhaps. But if 
none of our people try to make 
trouble — the aliens simply don’t 
want any troublei” 

He paused a moment. The 
death of the young Intelligence 
major had not been mentioned in 
the broadcast. Considering the 
issues involved, it was not, of 
course, a very important event 
and officially would be recorded 
as a suicide. In actual fact, the 
major had succeeded in wresting 
a gun from one of the men hold- 
ing him. Another man had shot 
him promptly without waiting to 
see what he intended to do with 
it. 

At all costs now, every rational 
human being must try to prevent 
trouble with the Visitors from 
Outside. 

He felt his face twitch suddenly 
into an uncontrollable grimace of 
horror. 

“But there’s no way of being 
absolutely sure, of course,” he 
heard his voice tell the silently 
gathering night about him, “that 
they won’t decide they just hap- 
pen to like our kind of bodies.”

TTERE. friends, is science fic- 
A-l- tion’s World of Tomorrow in 
publishing: an original 35-cent 
paper-backed anthology of 15 
first-rate short stories never be- 
fore published in any form, maga- 
zine or book! True, it’s not “read- 
ing tapes,” such as we old s.f. 
fans have been promised in the 
W. of T., but it's the next best 
thing. 

Ballantine Books can be con- 
gratulated on selecting an editor 



who knows good science fiction, 
too. Mr. Pohl has chosen well, 
even though, for my taste, the 
opener by William Morrison is a 
bit on the ghastly side, despite a 
fresh idea and good handling. 

On the other hand, we have 
Henry Kuttner and C. L. Moore 
(husband and wife) with a mag- 
nificent farce-fantasy on psycho- 
analysis; and we also have A-class 
stories by Leinster, Clarke, Korn- 
bluth, del Rey, Leiber (with a bit 
about “Slickie Millane” that 
should make a Certain Novelist 
want to sue for ego-damages!), 
Simak, John Wyndham, Tenn., 
H. L. Gold (what a sock end-

ing!) Bradbury (exquisite tale!), 
and Asimov. (He’s going fantasy, 
too!) . 

Only a couple of items fell flat 
on my ear, besides the Morrison. 
Judith Merril’s seemed in need of 
cutting, I thought, and Robert 
Sheckley’s Mars was a bit too 
much like Bradbury’s Mars. 

All in all, though, a magnificent 
collection. If your newsdealer 
doesn’t have it, make him get it 
for you. 

IN THE NAME OF SCIENCE 
by Martin Gardner, G. P. Put- 
nam's Sons, New York, 1952. 320 
pages, $4.00 

A SK the average man in the 
street what he thinks about 
science fiction and he probably 
will say, “Oh, you mean flying 
saucers and all that?” Completely 
unfair for serious writers and ap- 
preciative readers of good science 
fiction! 

Willy Ley, both in his column 
in Galaxy and elsewhere, is al- 
ways attacking this false concept, 
and now Martin Gardner has 
written a fascinating, documented 
study of phony science from Wil- 
bur Glenn Voliva, the flat-Earth 
man, to the spiritualists who take 
off where Dr. Joseph Rhine stops 
in his study of parapsychological 
phenomena. 

In between, Gardner covers 
every important crank and fraud 



in modern times, and does so 'With 
a care for accuracy, a thorough- 
ness of research, and an open- 
mindedness that make the book 
essential reading. 

There are chapters on every- 
thing from Velikovsky to Reich’s 
orgone boxes, from Forteanism to 
Lysenkoism, from Babson on 
gravity to Father Callahan on 
Einstein (“There is no use expect- 
ing Einstein to reason”), from 
dowsing to dianetics, and from 
Korzybski to Joseph Rhine, who 
Gardner feels may have some- 
thing, but not as much as his 
supporters claim for him. 

Nothing important has been 
omitted, as far as I know. It’s a 
rich gallery of cracks and quacks, 
visionaries, psychotics and char- 
latans, full of answers to those 
who may have fallen for one or 
another of their lines of gab. 

Just about the most stimulat- 
ing science book of the year.

lishers, Inc., New York, 1952. 263 
pages, $2.95 

r pHE best part of this “idea” 
-*• book is Dr. Clark’s very cir- 
cumstantial description of a 
planet with a silicone life form 
(“Uller”) and another with a 
fluorine atmosphere (“Niflheim”). 



★ * ★ * ★ SHELF 



121 



The three novelets written about 
these planets are readable, even 
though not in science fiction’s 
upper class. 

Fletcher Pratt’s “The Long 
View” is the best, with some good 
imagination, a certain sophistica- 
tion, and a clear understanding 
of the possible varieties of tomor- 
row’s sociologies, the complexi- 
ties of interstellar governments, 
and the eternal unpredictabilities 
of people in love. 

Judith Merril’s “Daughters of 
Earth” is a bit too feminist for 
my taste, and mushy and in need 
of cutting, but appealing never- 
theless. 

Piper’s novel-length “Uller Up- 
rising” is just a huge dithyramb 
in praise of war, the necessity of 
war and the strategy and tactics 
of war. It assumes that tomor- 
row’s Terran civilization is con- 
trolled by the descendants of Nazi 
generals, French collaborationists 
and the like, who lived safe in 
Latin America and elsewhere 
while World War Three deci- 
mated the rest of the world. Like 
any history of battle written with- 
out understanding or warmth, it 
bores and repels. 

Not a terribly inspiring book, 
on the whole. 

BALLROOM OF THE SKIES 
by John D. MacDonald. Green- 
berg, Publisher, New York, 1953. 
206 Pages, $2.75 



TT looks as if it has been decided 
-*• that the next war will elimi- 
nate most if not all of the U.S.A., 
Russia and Europe. 

As noted below, Sprague de 
Camp makes Brazil the center of 
his new era. Piper, in his novelet 
in The Petrified Planet (above), 
believes that South America, 
Africa and Australia will be the 
scenes of future greatness. In 
John MacDonald’s new one, India 
is the “new colossus,” the rich 
and arrogant “U.S.A. of tomor- 
row,” with the original U.S.A. 
nothing but a rundown tourist 
trap. 

Pessimism or prophecy? Who 
knows? 

Ballroom is an exciting and 
effective alien invasion novel, a 
bit reminiscent of Eric Russell’s 
Sinister Barrier. The problem : 
why is Earth always warring? 
Why do the “good people” never 
take control? The answer, when 
it comes, is both silly and de- 
featist; but in the process of get- 
ting there, MacDonald unreels an 
enthralling tale, full of parapsy- 
chological gadgetry and wonder- 
ful supermen from another galaxy 
in our midst, etc. 

Worthwhile, despite the unsat- 
isfactory ending.

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“ A S a result of the Third World 
^■•War," says de Camp, “the 
United States was reduced to a 
second-class power and the 
U.S.S.R. ceased to be a power at 
all. World Leadership was taken 
over by fast-growing Brazil.” The 
“Viagens Interplanetarias” is the 
“government-owned space trans- 
port system” that performed the 
“early spatial exploration.” 

And that’s all there is of solemn 
import in this otherwise cream - 
puff-light book of space opera. 
The eight tales deal mostly with 
the efforts of Terrans to make 
money off the “savages” of dis- 
tant plants, and the way these 
savages often get back their own 
with interest. 

Fine stuff for bedtime, but I do 
feel that the stories were written 
with the left hind paw of an 
immensely brilliant fellow who 
just wasn’t trying hard. Perhaps 
we should call it “relentlessly 
light reading!”

by E. A. Gut kind. Doubleday & 
Co., Inc., 1952. 400 photographic 
plates, $7.50. ( unpaged ) 

npHIS masterwork of “aviation 
-*■ geography” is one of the 
most intellectually exciting pho- 
tograph books ever published. A 
British reviewer referred to it as 
“a new kind of book . like 
something out of a fairy story.” 



What he really meant was “like 
something out of science fiction,” 
which is just what it is like. 

Maps, geographies of the stand- 
ard types, even on-the-ground 
photographs — none can make us 
feel what the Earth is really like. 

The air view is the only thing 
that does it — and it does it with 
often devastating results. Com- 
pare, in this book, the air photo 
of Pompeii and that of New York. 
The parallels are odd and un- 
comfortable. The 'photos of 
Krakatoa and the Arizona meteor 
crater are more typically science 
fictional, but actually they are 
not half as revealing of Man’s 
patterns of error, his persistence 
in repeating old mistakes. 

With this book, the phrase 
“bird’s-eye view” at last takes on 
meaning. And the view is amaz- 
ingly evocative. Don’t miss it!

Kombluth’s Machiavellian “That

1953. 351 pages, $3.95 

N ineteen tales at about 20^ 
each in this, Derleth’s 12th 
anthology. The best way to take 
the book is at the editor’s own 
valuation as “off -trail science fic- 
tion.” The liberal sprinkling of 
the weird, the supernatural and 
the impossible justifies the odd 
label. 

Like all of Derleth’s collections, 



this one is almost unbelievably 
uneven. There are top-level items 
by Theodore Sturgeon (from 
Weird Tales!) William Tenn, 
Ray Bradbury, Margaret St. 
Clair, and Arthur C. Clarke (who 
has two stories, one of which ap- 
peared before in another anthol- 
ogy), ordinary ones by Fritz Lei- 
ber, Lewis Padgett, and Mack 
Reynolds, and a clutch of others 
I can’t even arouse enough energy 
to try to grade.

Most love stories are about 
people. But not this story. 



By RICHARD WILSON 



T HEY had made the two 
robots, and then stopped. 
The war had come along 
and they’d had to convert Elec- 
tronicorp to the new economy. 
Malley, the chief scientist, tried 
to interest the government in the 
robots. He had a meeting with 
Boardman of the CIA and said 
they might be useful as spies, 
saboteurs or fifth columnists but 
Boardman said no; men still were 



best for that sort of thing. He’d 
bet on a trained agent’s ingenuity 
over a robot’s wiring any day. 
Besides, he said, a robot was ex- 
pected to serve man. Wouldn’t it 
be too much to ask it to make 
the fine distinction between a 
man it was expected to serve and 
a man it was expected to destroy? 

Malley was rather glad the ro- 
bots had been turned down. They 
were the first the plant had ever

made in human form and he was 
rather fond of them. They were 
the first of their kind in the world, 
as far as he knew. Experimental 
models X-l and X-2 was the way 
the records showed them. One 
masculoid and one feminoid. 
Alpha and Beta, one of the men 
in the lab named them, and, of 
course, they came to be known as 
A1 and Betty. 

They were pretty gorgeous- 
looking creations, these robots. 
For one thing, they were phys- 
ically perfect. Artists and ana- 
tomists had been among the 
consultants in their production. 
The two sets of experts finally had 
been persuaded to compromise on 
two life-size statues, which be- 
came the pilot models. 

The technicians had to use all 
their ingenuity to get their miles 
of wires and gadgets inside a cas- 
ing the size of a human body. 

“Give this guy one more inch 
around the waist,” one of them 
said, “and we’ll have no problem. 
Otherwise we’re going to have to 
detour this circuit by way of his 
left instep.” But the waistline re- 
mained trim and a way was 
found. 

Betty, the female, was less of a 
problem. Her generously rounded 
dimensions — here the anatomist 
had conceded more than the ar- 
tist — provided ample room for the 
stowing away of her intricate 
mechanisms. 



A T last they were finished. The 
-**- last weld had been covered 
with plastic skin and the last hair 
had been needled into its proper 
place. 

The technicians had a party in 
the lab that night. There was 
liquor and Gordon, one of the 
younger men, had too much of it. 
He became maudlin about Betty. 
He sat on the edge of the pedestal 
where she stood, nude and de- 
activated, and he stroked her leg 
gently. All of them knew how he 
felt; each of them also loved 
Betty in a special way. She was a 
combination of a daughter they 
had helped bring into the world, 
and the ideal woman, perfect and 
unattainable. 

Gordon was led away, sobbing, 
“I can’t help it; I love her.” 

And when they said, “Yes, but 
you mustn’t let it affect you,” he 
said, “No other girl will be good 
enough now.” 

“But she’s not a girl,” they said, 
“and you mustn’t think of her in 
that way.” 

“I don’t care, I don’t care,” 
he sobbed, “I love her, don’t you 
understand?” 

Al, the masculoid, had a less 
obvious effect. A few of the tech- 
nicians were women. They were 
pretty worldly gals, tough-talking 
and not usually susceptible, but 
it was noticeable that the male 
robot received only swift, indirect 
glances from them, as if they were 



IF YOU WERE THE ONLY- 



127 



afraid he would catch them in a 
spell if they looked at him di- 
rectly. 

The next day Electronicorp 
chastely dressed A1 and Betty in 
evening clothes and held a recep- 
tion to which the board of direc- 
tors and fheir wives and other 
business leaders and their wives 
were invited. The reason for the 
gathering was kept a secret while 
the guests chatted in groups in 
the lounge. Malley went from 
group to group and solemnly in- 
troduced “Mr. Alpha, one of our 
consulting engineers, and his wife, 
Betty.” 

The masquerade went off per- 
fectly. The robots sipped cock- 
tails, exchanged small talk and 
charmed the guests with their 
grace and modesty. 

Even when the after-dinner 
speaker introduced them later as 
robots, many of the guests re- 
fused to believe they were not 
human. The demonstration that 
followed divided them still more 
firmly into two camps — those who 
believed, and marveled at the 
built-in perfection of the human- 
oids, and those who were amused 
by the thought that Electronicorp 
had brought in two skilled enter- 
tainers, graduates, perhaps, of the 
school of pseudomechanical peo- 
ple once hired as traffic-stoppers 
for department store windows. 

There was a slight stiffness 
about A1 and Betty that lent 



weight to this belief. It was barely 
noticeable, and Malley was sure 
it could be worked out in later 
models — if not in X-3 and X-4, 
then certainly in X-5 and X-6. 

npHE demonstration was both 
-*• amusing and touching, the 
guests thought. The robots’ social 
graces had been proved during 
cocktails. Now, seated on the 
speakers’ dais, they were tested 
by a series of contrived little ac- 
cidents, such as the dropping of 
an ice cube down the front of 
Betty’s gown by the master of 
ceremonies. She shrieked and A1 
stood up threateningly. He made 
a fist and might have gone even 
further except for Malley’s quick 
explanation. 

The m.c. looked genuinely 
scared. When A1 sat down again 
he seemed to do it with bad 
grace, as if he knew he was a 
robot and didn’t like the restric- 
tions this imposed on him. 

That was the last public ap- 
pearance of X-l and X-2. The 
war took a turn for the worse, 
there at the start, and Electroni- 
corp had no time for sidelines. 

Malley sent back the rented 
evening clothes and put the ro- 
bots away at the back end of a 
basement storeroom at the plant. 
He deactivated them, of course, 
and he could have just slung 
them in a corner. But he did a 
peculiar thing. He had twin beds 



128 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 







IF YOU WERE THE ONLY- 



129 



taken in and made up with sheets 
and blankets, and he personally 
tucked each robot away before 
he locked up the storeroom and 
left them. 

It wasn't a long war, as wars 
had been going. But it was intense 
and Electronicorp was kept hum- 
ming around the clock. The per- 
sonnel gradually forgot about the 
robots, or moved on to other war 
jobs. Malley was so busy consult- 
ing with people in Washington, 
Detroit, Ottawa and sometimes 
Mexico City that he had no time 
to look in on the robots. 

And so, a year later they still 
were there, stiff in their beds in 
the gloomy storeroom, gathering 
dust with the rest of the forgotten 
equipment. 

Even young Gordon, the tech- 
nician who had professed his love 
for Betty, seemed to have for- 
gotten them. He’d found a real 
girl. 

But one day Gordon came to 
work surrounded by the fragrance 
of alcohol. He had the bottle with 
him and he referred to it from 
time to time as he told anyone 
who would listen how his girl had 
thrown him over. 

“She gave me the big goodby 
and went off with one of those 
uniformed yoyos from the Tech- 
nicorps,” he said, sniffling a little. 
“It’s fantastic. In fact, it’s re- 
volting. Enough to drive a man to 
drink. Here, have one — I’ve got 



more — enough for everyone.” 

And so Gordon drank at his 
bench and naturally no one ex- 
pected him to do any work that 
day, war or no war. When he dis- 
appeared, no one thought very 
much about it. 

rpHIS is what happened then, 
as Malley was able to piece it 
together later : 

Gordon went down to the base- 
ment, maybe half -remembering 
his old infatuation for Betty, and 
found the storeroom. It was 
locked, of course, but he made 
short work of the combination — a 
simple, presonic one — and the 
door swung open. 

It was a gloomy, windowless 
place. The only light, from a 
medium -intensity Everglo in the 
ceiling, cast stark shadows from 
the haphazard piles of crates and 
outmoded machine parts. 

Gordon let the door slip closed 
behind him. He saw the beds in 
the far corner, dimly. He shivered 
a bit and took a quick drink. 
He wiped his mouth on his sleeve, 
hesitated, took another drink, and 
went over to them. 

The robots were lying absolute- 
ly still, on their backs, the eyes 
closed, the covers drawn up to 
the chin. The beds were about 
three feet apart. There was a film 
of gray dust over everything. 

Gordon knelt between the beds, 
his back to Al,- and stared at 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Betty’s perfect face. He took out 
his handkerchief and tenderly 
flicked away the dust. He stroked 
her hair, gently. 

She was like a giant doll. 

Then he bent down and his 
warm lips touched hers. Her lips 
were cold, and hard. Gordon drew 
himself back, feeling self-conscious 
and a bit stupid. He realized that 
somewhere in his mind had been 
the story of Sleeping Beauty. But 
he, drunk and a little crazy, was 
hardly Prince Charming. 

He glanced quickly around. A1 
was just lying there, under his 
film of dust. What else would he 
be doing? 

Gordon took another drink. It 
was absolutely still in the big 
room and the gurgle of liquor 
made an indecent sound. The cap 
clanked as he screwed it back 
on the bottle. Gordon sat back 
on the dusty floor and slapped 
his pockets. No cigarettes. Damn. 

Now what? Leave quietly? Best 
thing, of course. Sensible thought. 
But who’s sensible? He laughed, 
and the sound echoed around the 
room. That scared him and he 
had to have another drink. 

TTE was careful this'time; there 
was almost no gurgle and ab- 
solutely no clank. Just the tiniest 
clink. He chuckled softly. Good 
man. 

He kicked the leg of the^jnale 
robot’s bed. The bed was on 

IF YOU WERE THE ONLY- 



wheels and it spun around and 
away so that the headboard hid 
A1 from his sight. 

“Okay,” Gordon said aloud. 
The sound of his voice didn’t 
frighten him now. He said it 
again. “Okay!” 

He got to his feet. 

“We’ll activate you, Beauty,” 
he said. “That’s what I came 
down here for, I guess. Little 
nodule. Base of the skull. Under 
the hair. No secrets from ol’ 
Gordie.” 

He knelt again at the side of 
the bed. He reached under her 
hair. The neck was cold in his 
palm. His fingers found the little 
bump. He pressed it, breathing 
heavily as he watched her closed 
eyes. 

Nothing happened. 

He waited a moment, tried 
again. 

Still nothing. 

“Damn that Malley. Changed 
the combination, that’s what he 
did.” 

Gordon knelt there, cursing 
Malley. But then he bent down 
over the robot’s face and again 
kissed the cold lips. As he leaned 
back, the eyes opened. 

There was no expression in 
them, yet. 

“Good hunch, eh?” he said. 
“That Malley’s a clever lad with 
his fairy-tale mind. Beds for ro- 
bots! So what’s more natural — 
if that’s the word for it — than a 



131 



caress plus a kiss?” 

The robot’s eyes blinked and 
the head turned so she was look- 
ing at him. 

“Only in this case the kiss is 
just carbon dioxide — an exhale. 
Good old carbon, the basis of life. 
Like priming a pump.” He 
laughed. “But I’ll bet Malley 
planned to do it antiseptieally — 
with an atomizer, maybe.” 

The robot began to breathe, al- 
most imperceptibly at first, then 
more strongly. Her breath smelled 
slightly of lubricating oil as her 
various mechanisms began to op- 
erate. In the stillness of the big 
room Gordon could hear them 
rumble into action. 

The eyes came alive. .They fo- 
cused on his and a puzzled frown 
came to her forehead. 

“TTELLO, Betty,” he said. 

“You’re awake now, aren’t 
you? Wide awake. Now we can 
have some fun.” 

She sat up in alarm. The bed- 
clothes fell away from her naked 
body. 

His eyes shifted and he said, 
“Boy, what a mechanism!” 

“Who are you?” Her speech 
came haltingly. 

“Me? I’m one of the guys that 
built you, that’s who.” 

“I don’t know you.” 

“Well, I know you, baby, be- 
lieve me. I know who you are 
and what you are. You’re a robot 



and I’m your master. Your func- 
tion is to serve man, as you rea- 
lize, of course, and — well, I’m 
a man.” 

“No!” The exclamation came 
sharply. 

He laughed humorlesslv. “Ro- 
bots don’t disobey. I say yes. 
Come here!” 

He grabbed her by the shoulder 
but she broke away from him and 
scrambled out of the bed, clutch- 
ing the sheet around her. She 
stood there, trembling, her eyes 
darting around the gloomy cav- 
ern of a room. 

“Al!” she cried. 

Gordon got drunkenly to his 
feet at the other side of the bed. 

“Al, is it? He can’t help you; 
he’s sound asleep.” 

Gordon circled around the bed, 
clumsily. He was having trouble 
with his feet. She stepped back. 

“Damn you, come here!” he 
shouted. “You can’t act like this 
with me.” He made a lunge at 
her and she fled from him, one 
end of the sheet trailing behind 
her. He stumbled after her. His 
heavy foot came down on the 
end of the sheet and it was torn 
from her grasp as she ran on, 
dodging between tall packing 
cases and around the piles of 
machinery. 

Gordon wavered after her, 
leering, his eyes fixed on her. He 
tripped over a coil of wire and 
fell. His head struck the con- 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Crete floor and he lay motionless. 

Betty circled back, past the 
limp body, and threw herself 
across the chest of the male ro- 
bot, lying stiff in his bed. 

“Al,” she cried. “Wake up, 
please! That horrible man!” 

The masculoid was silent and 
unmoving. 

She cradled his head in her 
arms and kissed the dusty lips. 

There was no response. 

“You must wake up! You 
must!” 

He was stiff and cold. 

TIER intricate pseudobrain 
pulsed as it chose among the 
data, old and new, that had been 
fed into it. The nodule at the 
back of the head — not enough. 
The carbon dioxide — yes, that 
was the other part of it. But she 
had none of her own. She had 
been indoctrinated as a female 
and so she shuddered at the 
recollection of how she had been 
awakened by Gordon — and what 
she must do now to awaken Al. 

Reluctantly she went back to 
Gordon’s prone body. He was 
breathing heavily, great gasps of 
air being sucked into the flaccid 
mouth and being expelled. 

She picked him up with revul- 
sion but without difficulty. He 
seemed light enough to her. She 
carried the unconscious man to 
the bed, shifting him so she was 
able to hold him against her body 

IF YOU WERE THE ONLY- 



with one arm, his head hanging 
down limply, his face close to 
that of the deactivated robot. 
With the other hand she pressed 
the nodule at the back of the 
robot’s skull. 

Al’s eyes opened. 

With a cry of relief, she swung 
Gordon’s body away and dropped 
him on the floor. She knelt and 
used a corner of the sheet to 
brush the dust from the face 
of the waking robot. 

“Al, oh, Al,” she said softly. 

The masculoid began to 
breathe. He became aware of her. 

“Betty!” he said. “What’s hap- 
pened? What is this place?” 

Built-in tears came to her eyes 
now. She didn’t know, she told 
him, explaining the manner of her 
awakening and the terror of the 
past several minutes. 

He sat up as he listened to her 
and he saw Gordon lying on the 
floor. Before she had finished he 
threw the covers aside and leaped 
from the bed. He lifted the un- 
conscious body into the air and 
hurled it from him. 

ORDON crashed into a con- 
crete wall. He moaned once 
as he crumpled to the floor. His 
body convulsed and he was still 
now, in a new way. 

“I’ll put this disgusting thing 
out of our sight,” Al said. 

He dragged the corpse to a far 
corner and pushed it behind a 

133 



crate out of sight. 

The masculoid was smiling as 
he returned to the feminoid. 

“I feel fine,” he said. 

“I’m glad.” 

“And yet I have a doubt. We’re 
strangely made, we two.” 

“We must tell Mr. Malley,” 
she said. “He made us the way 
we are. He’ll know.” 

“We’re contradictory,” he said. 
“We know we’re robots, but 
we’ve been taught that there are 
limits to our subservience. Our 
loyalty is to men — but not to all 
men. To certain individuals, like 
Mr. Malley, and to each other.” 
“But not to . him,” said 
Betty. “That Gordon.” 

“Forget him,” A1 said, and then 
he laughed. “That’s an idiom. 
We’re built to forget nothing, of 
course. But omit him from your 
surface thought. He must have 
been like the evil ones Mr. Malley 
told us we might be called on to 
help destroy, one day.” 

“I’ll ‘forget’ him,” she said, 
smiling. 

“Good.” he said. He looked at 
her, as she stood close to him 
in the dusty underground vault, 
from her smiling face to her per- 
fectly-formed toes. “You’re beau- 
tiful,” he said. 

“You are, too,” she said, look- 
ing at him as frankly. 

“No, I’m handsome,” he said 
naively. “A difference in sex 
predicates a difference in termin- 



ology. You remember.” 

“I do now,” she said. “I had a 
harder time with my lessons than 
you did. I think Mr. Malley did 
that deliberately. He said once 
that we’d get along better — we 
two— if you knew more than I 
did. Where is Mr. Malley, Al? 
Shall we find him?” 

“Yes, but we must clothe our- 
selves first.” 

“Why?” she asked innocently. 
’’You just said we’re beautiful 
and handsome as we are.” 

“I think it’s a custom for when 
you visit a person. There was 
that reception cocktail, when we 
visited among all those human 
ones. I will have to wear a black 
suit with a black tie and a white 
shirt and you will have to wear 
a gown that reaches from your 
feet to the center of your breasts. 
Then we will be proper.” 

“I see,” she said. 

And so the robots began a 
search for clothing in which to 
call on Malley. It was in the 
course of this futile exploration of 
the big room that they discov- 
ered it was a prison. The only 
entrance was the one Gordon had 
used and the door to it had auto- 
matically locked behind him. 
Even Al’s great strength could 
not force it open. 

There was no way out and no 
way of communicating with the 
outside. 

They were trapped.

rriHEY walked slowly back to 
the corner of the room that 
was theirs, hand in hand, and sat 
on the edge of her bed. 

“If we’re going to be here for 
a while, at least I could tidy up 
the place,” Betty said finally. 

“It is rather bleak,” A1 replied. 
“But that shouldn’t make any 
difference to us. We’re just ma- 
chines.” 

“Not ‘just,’ ” she objected. 
“We’re more than ‘just.’ ” 

“I speak ironically,” he said. 
“That’s a human trait. It seems 
to me that we’re more human 
than we were meant to be. I won- 
der if Mr. Malley knows as much 
about us as we do.” 

“More, probably.” 

“That’s a feminine viewpoint, 
if I ever heard one.” 

“You sound as if you’d heard 
a lot of them,” she said. 

He laughed. “Here we go — 
bickering, just like people. That 
supports my theory that there’s 
more to us than was put into us.” 
“Of course I don’t know, only 
being a female,” she said, “but 
wouldn’t that be against nature? 
I mean — blasphemous, sort of?” 
“Making us creations of the 
Devil?” he asked. “No. we’re ma- 
chines, all right. Intricate, care- 
fully-planned machines, made by 
the mind of man, with certain 
mechanical advantages over man. 
We don’t get hungry, for in- 
stance. Which is a comfort in 



our present circumstances.” 

“We ate at that dinner thing, 
though,” she pointed out. 

“Special adaptation,” he said, 
“to help the deception along. We 
drank, too. They drained it all 
out of us later.” 

She sighed. “The more I think 
of that time, the more this place 
depresses me. I’ve got to do some- 
thing about it. Will you help me, 
Al? Look into those crates and 
see if there’s anything we can 
use. Mr. Malley ’s bound to come 
back for us one day and we want 
our home to be nice for him, don’t 
we?” 

“The little woman,” he laughed. 
“You get more human every 
minute. I imagine Mr. Malley’d 
be just as happy if he found us 
tucked into bed where he put us. 
But all right; if it will please you, 
ma’am, I’ll see what I can do.” 
He bowed, as if he were in full 
formal regalia instead of naked, 
and kissed her hand. She giggled. 

“There you go again,” he said. 
“If I didn’t know for sure that 
you were ticking away inside, 
just like me, I’d suspect you of 
having bfcen born.” 

npHEY went to work. In one 
crate Al found carpenter’s 
tools and, by combining a few 
vague built-in memories with trial 
and error, he learned how to use 
them. In another crate was a 
bolt of linen-like plastic. A third

yielded only books. 

Working indefatigably, as ro- 
bots could, they soon had fash- 
ioned an apartment which 
wouldn’t have won any decorat- 
ing prizes but which was a vast 
improvement over the previous 
bleakness. A1 had put together 
rough but sturdy chairs and a 
table and thrown up a partition 
which hid the rest of the store- 
room from view. With an adze 
from the tool chest, he cut the 
plastic into lengths that Betty 
used to drape their new walls. 
Every bit of dust had been re- 
moved. They’d wheeled out the 
beds, cleaned them and shaken 
the bedclothes and wheeled them 
back. A stand between them held 
a conglomeration of radio parts 
A1 had found and which he 
planned to try to put together 
into a receiver. 

It was a pity about the books. 
Neither of the robots had been 
taught to read. They’d learned 
by more direct methods. But the 
books had many diagrams. Per- 
haps in time they could find a 
link between them and the words. 
A1 built a bookcase. * 

He found wiring and spare 
Everglos and banished the gloom 
from their corner. 

Time fled by. They were busy 
together and so they were happy 
together. There were improve- 
ments and refinements to be 
made constantly. A1 worked at 



the receiving set and, after much 
experimentation, he built a mon- 
strosity of wiring and tubing 
which succeeded in bringing in 
signals. They seemed to be the 
audio signals of audio-video pro- 
grams and the robots listened 
half-comprehendingly to an im- 
perfect reflection of a world they 
had known only fleetingly. 

They spent * hours listening, 
learning about that world. The 
radio gave them bits and pieces 
of knowledge, now and again pro- 
viding them with an insight that 
filled in vast areas for them. 

The radio also made them con- 
scious of time. There was no day 
or night in their subterranean 
world, but the radio provided the 
division for them. They were told 
constantly what time it was; 
there was a special emphasis on 
time in the morning. This seemed 
to be the busiest part of the 
day and the robots adjusted 
their schedule accordingly, mak- 
ing these hours span the peak of 
their activity. There was a time 
of relaxation in the afternoon, it 
appeared, when people listened to 
stories played out for them. They 
were rather stupid stories, the ro- 
bots decided, and perhaps they 
were planned that way — dull and 
monotonous — to lull people to 
sleep. Then, after resting, they 
would be refreshed for the new 
round of activity that began at 
supper time.

This was news time. Here they 
learned of the mighty events tak- 
ing place in the world above. 
Mostly it was the war, which was 
being won, but slowly, as the 
enemy retreated, preserving an 
unbroken circle about his land, 
but seeing his industry and air- 
fields and cities pounded to 
pieces. 

J'T'HE more they listened to the 
radio, the more restless they 
became. They wanted to be out, 
helping, or at least participating 
in this valiant activity on behalf 
of their land. 

Again they made the rounds 
of the storeroom, seeking an exit 
they might have missed. There 
was none. 

One part of the storeroom was 
fetid now with the odor of Gor- 
don’s corpse. 

Time was beginning to drag. 
Conscious of what days were, 
they began to count them, and 
the counting was slow. The radio 
programs now were more frus- 
trating than enlightening and 
they did not listen as often. The 
books were too much for them; 
they were weighty technical vol- 
umes — no primers even for robots. 

Even their conversation flagged. 
At first each had been delighted 
with the other’s mind. His was 
sharp and knowledgable, hers 
wise and intuitive. But, with no 
stimulus except the radio and 

IF YOU WERE THE ONLY- 



the too-familiar apartment and 
the drab gray storeroom beyond, 
they became dull. For . hours at 
a time, they didn’t speak. 

Their physical attraction for 
each other dimmed, too. They ex- 
perimented with sex, having had 
it suggested to them obliquely on 
the radio, but there was no en- 
joyment in it for them; they felt 
awkward and ashamed. 

Moreover, they were dirty. The 
dust and grime of the storeroom 
crept in on them despite their 
efforts and they could do no more 
than try to brush it away. There 
was no place to wash. Their 
bodies grayed and the soles of 
their feet became black. 

npHEY were sitting, one day, 
looking at nothing, the radio 
silent, the odor of the decaying 
Gordon beginning to creep into 
their corner of the basement, 
when Betty cried out. It was a 
wordless sound, of anguish and 
despair. 

A1 looked at her almost with- 
out curiosity. 

“I wish we’d never been made,” 
she said. 

He grunted in token reply. 

“It’s cruel,” she said. “It’s un- 
fair.” 

“Inhuman,” he agreed sardon- 
ically. 

“We belong up there,” she said, 
“even if they don’t think so. 
They’ve designed us to belong 

137 



and they have a responsibility, 
even to robots.” 

“Sure,” he said impatiently. 
“Only nobody expected us to 
wake up so early.” 

“That stinking Gordon!” she 
said literally. 

“I’m sure Mr. Malley will be 
back for us one day,” A1 said 
almost to himself. “But what will 
we be like when he comes? He 
made us in the image of man, but 
we’ll be more like beasts if he 
doesn’t come soon. We’re getting 
filthy and careless and I, for one, 
don’t think I can stand much 
more of it. I think my mind is 
beginning to be affected — it 

doesn’t take much to unbalance a 
sensitive mechanism.” 

“I know,” she said. “And I’ve 
been thinking. Shouldn’t we pre- 
serve ourselves as we are, be- 
fore we deteriorate completely? 
Couldn’t we — ?” 

“What?” he asked. “Commit 
suicide?” 

“Yes, or the equivalent. If we 
broke down gradually we’d be 
thrown out of balance all through 
our systems and nobody would 
take the trouble — or take a 
chance with a couple of mad ro- 
bots. They’d just junk us. But 
if we stopped ourselves sudden- 
ly . 

“They could repair us,” A1 said. 
“Yes. We know we can’t deac- 
tivate each other — but we could 
‘kill’ ourselves.” 



They were silent at the thought. 

“Let’s do that,” Betty said 
finally, in a quiet voice. 

TTE looked across at the femin- 
oid, sitting despairingly in 
the rude chair on the concrete 
floor. He saw the tangled, dirtied 
blonde hair, the gray unhappy 
face, the ideally feminine body 
now become a travesty under its 
caked # dirt. He felt himself filthy 
also and imagined how he looked 
to her. 

“All right,” he said. 

“Good,” she said. Then she 
smiled crookedly. “But let’s not 
be messy about it, please.” 

“Feminoid vanity?” he said. 
“All right. That eliminates but- 
ting our heads against the wall. 
There are dozens of other ways, 
according to the crime programs 
on the radio, but most of them 
are impracticable for us. And 
most of them are messy, besides. 
I think there’s really only one 
way.” 

“What’s that?” she asked. 

“Electricity. There’s enough 
equipment around to do it and 
it should be no problem at all 
to feed ourselves a power over- 
load. Just enough to bum out one 
strategic set of wires.” 

He stood up. “I’ll go see about 
it now.” 

“I’ll come help,” she said. 

Betty got to her feet. But then 
she faltered and put out a hand. 



138

“What is it?” he asked. 

“I feel so — funny. So weak, 
suddenly.” 

He held her in his arms and a 
wave of tenderness swept over 
him. “Poor baby,” he said. 

She looked up into his eyes 
and her forehead wrinkled into 
a frown. 

“Al,” she said. Her voice was a 
whisper. “Al ... I think I'm — 
running down.” 

TTE held her tightly. A tear 
■l-*- welled out of the corner of 
one eye and made a wet track 
down her dirty cheek. 

“Is it so sad?” he asked. 
“You’re running down. You’ll go 
back to sleep — normally. That 
solves the problem without ‘sui- 
cide.’ ” , 

“I’m not crying for me, silly,” 
she said. "I’m thinking of you 
here all alone after I’m gone. I 
know how awful it would be for 
me in this horrible place.” 

Her voice was becoming fainter. 
“I’ll be going along soon after 
you,” he said. “You woke up just 
a few minutes before I did. I’m 
sure we were given approximately 
the same charge.” 

“I can’t see so well now,” she 
said. “Your face is just a blur.” 
He picked her up in his arms 
and carried her to her bed. He 
put her in it and gently brought 
the covers up to her chin. 

“Somehow,” she said, “I don’t 

IF YOU WERE THE ONLY- 



want to go — now. Isn’t that silly? 
But little as we had, it was ours — 
a world we made for ourselves. 
And I’m worried about later — 
when Mr. Malley comes back for 
us.” She lifted her head in urg- 
ency. “He will come back, won’t 
he? He’ll wake us — and I’ll be 
seeing you again? Won’t I . 
darling?” 

“Yes, of course.” 

“And we’ll be all right? It 
won’t be too much for us — that 
world up there — full of people?” 
“We’ll be all right,” he said. 
“I believe you,” she said. A 
smile came over the grimy face. 
“I feel . very . sleepy . .” 
She closed her eyes. The smile 
remained when the breathing 
stopped. 

Al kissed the cold lips. He ar- 
ranged the straggly hair more 
neatly on the pillow. He touched 
the still face, gently. 

Then he drew his bed close to 
hers. He slipped under the covers 
and waited, looking across at her 
with a smile of his own. 

Soon he, too, began to feel 
weak. It was a strange but de- 
licious sensation. His eyes became 
heavy and he stretched out com- 
fortably. He looked once more at 
Betty. 

“Goodnight, my darling,” the 
robot said. “See you ... in the 
morning.” 

He closed his eyes.

harmful life-form.” Lieutenant 
Friendly sat down on the edge 
of the lab table, avoiding the cul- 
ture bowls. ‘‘What kind of place 
is this? No disease germs, no lice, 
no flies, no rats, no — ” 

“No whiskey or red light dis- 
tricts.” Hall straightened up. 
“Quite a place. I was sure this 
brew would show something along 
the lines of’ Terra’s eberthella 
typhi. Or the Martian sand rot 
corkscrew.” 

“But the whole planet’s harm- 
less. You know, I’m wondering 
whether this is the Garden of 
Eden our ancestors fell out of.” 
“Were pushed out of.” 

TTALL wandered over to the 
window of the lab and con- 
templated the scene beyond. He 
had to admit it was an attractive 
sight. Rolling forests and hills, 
green slopes alive with flowers 
and endless vines; waterfalls and 
hanging moss; fruit trees, acres 
of flowers, lakes. Every effort had 
been made to preserve intact the 
surface of Planet Blue — as it had 
been designated by the original 
scout ship, six months earlier. 

Hall sighed. “Quite a place. I 
wouldn’t mind coming back here 
again some time.” 

“Makes Terra seem a little 
bare.” Friendly took out his ciga- 
rettes; then put them away again. 
“You know, the place has a fun- 
ny effect on me. I don’t smoke 



any more. Guess that’s because 
of the way it looks. It’s so — so 
damn pure. Unsullied. I can’t 
smoke or throw papers around. I 
can’t bring myself to be a pic- 
nicker.” 

“The picnickers’ll be along 
soon enough,” Hall said. He went 
back to the microscope. “I’ll try 
a few more cultures. Maybe I’ll 
find a lethal germ yet.” 

“Keep trying.” Lieutenant 
Friendly hopped off the table. 
“I’ll see you later and find out if 
you’ve had any luck. There’s a 
big conference going on in Room 
One. They’re almost ready to give 
the go-ahead to the E.A. for the 
first load of colonists to be sent 
out.” 

“Picnickers!” 

Friendly grinned. “Afraid so.” 

The door closed after him. His 
bootsteps echoed down the corri- 
dor. Hall was alone in the lab. 

He sat for a time in thought. 
Presently he bent down and re- 
moved the slide from the stage 
of the microscope, selected a new 
one and held it up to the light to 
read the marking. The lab was 
warm and quiet. Sunlight stream- 
ed through the windows and 
across the floor. The trees out- 
side moved a little in the wind. 
He began to feel sleepy. 

“Yes, the picnickers,” he grum- 
bled. He adjusted the new slide 
into position. “And all of them 
ready to come in and cut down

the trees, tear up the flowers, spit 
in the lakes, burn up the grass. 
With not even the common cold 
virus around to — ” 

He stopped, his voice choked 
off— 

— Choked off, because the two 
eyepieces of the microscope had 
twisted suddenly around his 
windpipe and were trying to 
strangle him. Hall tore at them, 
but they dug relentlessly into his 
throat, steel prongs closing like 
the claws of a trap. 

Throwing the microscope onto 
the floor, he leaped up. The micro- 
scope crawled quickly toward 
him, hooking around his leg. He 
kicked it loose with his other 
foot, and drew his blast pistol. 

The microscope scuttled away, 
rolling on its coarse adjustments. 
Hall fired. It disappeared in a 
cloud of metallic particles. 

“Good God!” Hall sat down 
weakly, mopping his face. “What 
the — ?” He massaged his throat. 
“What the hell!” 

^T'HE council room was packed 
solid. Every officer of the 
Planet Blue unit was there. Com- 
mander Stella Morrison tapped 
on the big control map with the 
end of a slim plastic pointer. 

“This long flat area is ideal for 
the actual city. It’s close to water, 
and weather conditions vary suffi- 
ciently to give the settlers some- 
thing to talk about. There are 



large deposits of various minerals. 
The colonists can set up their 
own factories. They won’t have 
to do any importing. Over here 
is the biggest forest on the planet. 
If they have any sense, they’ll 
leave it. But if they want to make 
newspapers out of it, that’s not 
our concern.” 

She looked around the room 
at the silent men. 

“Let’s be realistic. Some of you 
have been thinking we shouldn’t 
send the okay to the Emigration 
Authority, but keep the planet 
our own selves, to come back to. 
I’d like that as much as any of 
the rest of you, but we’d just get 
into a lot of trouble. It’s not our 
planet. We’re here to do a certain 
job. When the job is done, we 
move along. And it is almost 
done. So let’s forget it. The only 
thing left to do is flash the go- 
ahead signal and then begin 
packing our things.” 

“Has the lab report come in 
on bacteria?” Vice-Commander 
Wood asked. 

“We’re taking special care to 
look out for them, of course. But 
the last I heard nothing had been 
found. I think we can go ahead 
and contact the E.A. Have them 
send a ship to take us off and 
bring in the first load of settlers. 
There’s no reason why — ” she 
stopped. 

A murmur was swelling 
through the room. Heads turned 



COLONY

toward the door. 

Commander Morrison frowned. 
“Major Hall, may I remind you 
that when the council is in session 
no one is permitted to interrupt!” 

H ALL swayed back and forth, 
supporting himself by hold- 
ing onto the doorknob. He gazed 
vacantly around the council room. 
Finally his glassy eyes picked out 
Lieutenant Friendly, sitting half- 
way across the room. 

“Come here,” he said hoarsely. 
“Me?” Friendly sank further 
down in his chair. 

“Major, what is the meaning 
of this?” Vice-Commander Wood 
cut in angrily. “Are you drunk or 
are — ?” He saw the blast gun in 
Hall’s hand. “Is something wrong, 
Major?” 

Alarmed, Lieutenant Friendly 
got up and grabbed Hall’s shoul- 
der. “What is it? What’s the mat- 
ter?” 

“Come to the lab.” 

"Did you find something?” the 
Lieutenant studied his friend’s 
rigid face. “What is it?” 

“Gome on.” Hall started down 
the corridor, Friendly following. 
Hall pushed the laboratory door 
open, stepped inside slowly. 

“What is it?” Friendly repeat- 
ed. 

“My microscope.” 

“Your microscope? What about 
it?” Friendly squeezed past him 
into the lab. “I don’t see it.” 



“It's gone.” 

“Gone? Gone where?” 

“I blasted it.” 

“You blasted it?” Friendly 
looked at the other man. “I don’t 
get it. Why?” 

Hall’s mouth opened and clos- 
ed, but no sound came out. 

“Are you all right?” Friendly 
asked in concern. Then he bent 
down and lifted a black plastic 
box from a shelf under the table. 
“Say, is this a gag?” 

He removed Hall’s microscope 
from the box. “What do you 
mean, you blasted it? Here it is, 
in its regular place. Now, tell me 
what’s going on? You saw some- 
thing on a slide? Some kind of 
bacteria? Lethal? Toxic?” 

Hall approached the micro- 
scope slowly. It was his, all right. 
There was the nick just above 
the fine adjustment. And one of 
the stage clips was slightly bent. 
He touched it with his finger. 

Five minutes ago this micro- 
scope had tried to kill him. And 
he knew he had blasted it out of 
existence. 

“You sure you don’t need a 
psych test” Friendly asked anx- 
iously. “You look like post- 
trauma to me, or worse.” 

“Maybe you’re right,” Hall 
muttered. 

T^HE robot psyche tester whir- 
red, integrating and gestalting. 
At last its color code lights

changed from red to green. 
“Well?” Hall demanded. 
“Severe disturbance. Instability 
ratio up above ten.” 

“That’s over danger?” 

“Yes. Eight is danger. Ten is 
unusual, especially for a person 
of your index. You usually show 
about a four.” 

Hall nodded wearily. “I know.” 
“If you could give me more 
data — ” 

Hall set his jaw. “I can’t tell 
you any more.” 

“It’s illegal to hold back in- 
formation during a psyche test,” 
the machine said peevishly. “If 
you do that you deliberately dis- 
tort my findings.” 

Hall rose. “I can’t tell you any 
more. But you do record a high 
degree of unbalance for me?” 
“There’s a high degree of 
psychic disorganization. But what 
it means, or why it exists, I can’t 
say.” 

“Thanks.” Hall clicked the 
tester off. He went back to his 
own quarters. His head whirled. 
Was he out of his mind? But he 
had fired his blast gun at some- 
thing. Afterward, he had tested 
the atmosphere in the lab, and 
there were metallic pa. tides in 
suspension, especially near the 
place he had fired his blast gun 
at the microscope. 

But how could a thing like that 
be? A microscope coming to life, 
trying to kill him! 



Anyhow, Friendly had pulled 
it out of its box, whole and sound. 
But how had it gotten back in 
the box? 

He stripped off his uniform and 
entered the shower. While he ran 
warm water over his body he 
meditated. The robot psyche 
tester had showed his mind was 
severely disturbed, but that could 
have been the result, rather than 
the cause, of the experience. He 
had started to tell Friendly about 
it but he had stopped. How could 
he expect anyone to believe a 
story like that? 

He shut off the water and 
reached out for one of the towels 
on the rack. 

The towel wrapped around his 
wrist, yanking him against the 
wall. Rough cloth pressed over 
his mouth and nose. He fought 
wildly, pulling away. All at once 
the towel let go. He fell, sliding 
to the floor, his head striking the 
wall. Stars shot around him; then 
violent pain. 

FITTING in a pool of warm 
^ water. Hall looked up at the 
towel rack. The towel was mo- 
tionless now, like the others with 
it. Three towels in a row, all 
exactly alike, all unmoving. Had 
he dreamed it? 

He got shakily to his feet, rub- 
bing his head. Carefully avoiding 
the towel rack, he edged out of 
the shower and into his room. He 



COLONY 



145 



pulled a new towel from the dis- 
penser in a gingerly manner. It 
seemed normal. He dried himself 
and began to put his clothes on. 

His belt got him around the 
waist and tried to crush him. It 
was strong — it had reinforced 
metal links to hold his leggings 
and his gun. He and the belt 
rolled silently on the floor, strug- 
gling for control. The belt was 
like a furious metal snake, whip- 
ping and lashing at him. At last 
he managed to get his hand 
around his blaster. 

At once the belt let go. He 
blasted it out of existence and 
then threw himself down in a 
chair, gasping for breath. 

The arms of the chair closed 
around him. But this time the 
blaster was ready. He had to 
fire six times before the chair fell 
limp and he was able to get up 
again. 

He stood half -dressed in the 
middle of the room, his chest ris- 
ing and falling. 

“It isn’t possible,” he whisper- 
ed. “I must be out of my mind.” 

Finally he got his leggings and 
boots on. He went outside into 
the empty corridor. Entering the 
lift, he ascended to the top floor. 

Commander Morrison looked 
up from her desk as Hall stepped 
through the robot clearing screen. 
It pinged. 

“You’re armed,” the Com- 
mander said accusingly. 



Hall looked down at the blaster 
in his hand. He put it down on 
the desk. “Sorry.” 

“What do you want? What’s 
the matter with you? I have a re- 
port from the testing machine. It 
says you’ve hit a ratio of ten 
within the last twenty-four hour 
period.” She studied him intently. 
“We’ve known each other for a 
long time, Lawrence. What’s hap- 
pening to you?” 

Hall took a deep breath. “Stel- 
la, earlier today my microscope 
tried to strangle me.” 

Her blue eyes widened. 
“What!” 

“Then, when I was getting out 
of the shower, a bath towel tried 
to smother me. I got by it, but, 
while I was dressing, my belt — ” 
he stopped. The Commander had 
gotten to her feet. 

“Guards!” she called. 

“Wait, Stella.” Hall moved to- 
ward her. “Listen to me. This is 
serious. There’s something wrong. 
Four times things have tried to 
kill me. Ordinary objects sudden- 
ly turned lethal. Maybe it’s what 
we’ve been looking for. Maybe 
this is — ” 

“Your microscope tried to kill 
you?” 

“It came alive. Its stems got me 
around the windpipe.” 

There was a long silence. “Did 
anyone see this happen besides 
you?” 

“No.” 



146 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“What did you do?” 

“I blasted it.” 

“Are there any remains?” 
“No,” Hall admitted reluctant- 
ly. “As a matter of fact, the 
microscope seems- to be all right, 
again. The way it was before. 
Back in its box.” 

“I see.” The Commander nod- 
ded to the two guards who had 
answered her call. “Take Major 
Hall down to Captain Taylor and 
have him confined until he can be 
sent back to Terra for examina- 
tion.” 

She watched calmly as the two 
guards took hold of Hall’s arms 
with magnetic grapples. 

“Sorry, Major,” she said. “Un- 
less you can prove any of your 
story, we’ve got to assume it’s a 
psychotic projection on your 
part. And the planet isn’t well 
enough policed for us to allow a 
psychotic to run around loose. 
You could do a lot of damage.” 
The guards moved him toward 
the door. Hall went unprotesting- 
ly. His head rang, rang and 
echoed. Maybe she was right. 
Maybe he was out of his mind. 

npHEY came to Captain Tay- 
lor’s offices. One of the guards 
rang the buzzer. 

“Who is it?” the robot door de- 
manded shrilly. 

“Commander Morrison orders 
this man put under the Captain’s 
care.” 



There was a hesitant pause, 
then: “The Captain is busy.” 
“This is an emergency.” 

The robot’s relays clicked while 
it made up its mind. “The Com- 
mander sent you?” 

“Yes. Open up.” 

“You may enter,” the robot 
conceded finally. It drew its locks 
back, releasing the door. 

The guard pushed the door 
open. And stopped. 

On the floor lay Captain Tay- 
lor, his face blue, his eyes gaping. 
Only his head and his feet were 
visible. A red and white scatter 
rug was wrapped around him, 
squeezing, straining tighter and 
tighter. 

Hall dropped to the floor and 
pulled at the rug. “Hurry!” he 
barked. “Grab it!” 

The three of them pulled to- 
gether. The rug resisted. 

“Help,” Taylor cried weakly. 
“We’re trying!” They tugged 
frantically. At last the rug came 
away in their hands. It flopped 
off rapidly toward the open door. 
One of the guards blasted it. 

Hall ran to the vidscreen and 
shakily dialed the Commander’s 
emergency number. 

Her face appeared on the 
screen. 

“See!” he gasped. 

She stared past him to Taylor 
lying on the floor, the two guards 
kneeling beside him, their blasters 
still out. 



COLONY

“What — what happened?” 

“A rug attacked him.” Hall 
grinned without amusement. 
“Now who’s crazy?” 

“We’ll send a guard unit 
down.” She blinked. “Right 
away. But how — ” 

“Tell them to have their blast- 
ers ready. And better make that a 
general alarm to everyone." 

Hall placed four items on Com- 
mander Morrison’s desk: a micro- 
scope, a towel, a metal belt, and 
a small red and white rug. 

She edged away nervously. 
“Major, are you sure — ?” 

“They’re all right, now. That’s 
the strangest part. This towel. A 
few hours ago it tried to kill me. 
I got away by blasting it to par- 
ticles, But here it is, back again. 
The way it always was. Harm- 
less.” 

Captain Taylor fingered the 
red and white rug warily. “That's 
my rug. I brought it from Terra. 
My wife gave it to me. I — I trust- 
ed it completely.” 

They all looked at each other. 
“We blasted the rug, too,” Hall 
pointed out. 

There was silence. 

“Then what was it that at- 
tacked me?” Captain Taylor ask- 
ed. “If it wasn’t this rug?” 

“It looked like this rug,” Hall 
said slowly. “And what attacked 
me looked like this towel.” 

Commander Morrison held the 
towel up to the light. “It’s just 



an ordinary towel! It couldn’t 
have attacked you.” 

“Of course not,” Hall agreed. 
“We’ve put these objects through 
all the tests we can think of. 
They’re just what they’re sup- 
posed to be, all elements un- 
changed. Perfectly stable non- 
organic objects. It’s impossible 
that any of these could have come 
to life and attacked us.” 

“But something did,” Taylor 
said. “Something attacked me. 
And if it wasn’t this rug, what 
was it?” 

IEUTENANT Dodds felt 
around on the dresser for his 
gloves. He was in a hurry. The 
whole unit had been called to 
emergency asembly. 

“Where did I — ?” he murmur- 
ed. “What the hell!” 

For on the bed were two pairs 
of identical gloves, side by side. 

Dodds frowned, scratching his 
head. How could it be? He owned 
only one pair. The others must 
be somebody else’s. Bob Wesley 
had been in the night before, 
playing cards. Maybe he had left 
them. 

The vidscreen flashed again. 
“All personnel, report at once. 
All personnel, report at once. 
Emergency assembly of all per- 
sonnel.” 

“All right!” Dodds said im- 
patiently. He grabbed up one of 
the pairs of gloves, sliding them 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



148 



onto his hands. 

As soon as they were in place, 
the gloves carried his hands down 
to his waist. They clamped his 
fingers over the butt of his gun, 
lifting it from his holster. 

“I’ll be damned,” Dodds said. 
The gloves brought the blast gun 
up, pointing it at his chest. 



The fingers squeezed. There 
was a roar. Half of Dodds’ chest 
dissolved. What was left of him 
fell slowly to the floor, the mouth 
still open in amazement. 

/'CORPORAL Tenner hurried 
^ across the ground toward the 
main building, as soon as he 




COLONY 



149 



heard the wail of the emergency 
alarm. 

At the entrance to the building 
he stopped to take off his metal- 
cleated boots. Then he frowned. 
By the door were two safety mats 
instead of one. 

Well, it didn’t matter. They 
were both the same. He stepped 
onto one of the mats and waited. 
The surface of the mat sent a 
flow of high-frequency current 
through his feet and legs, killing 
any spores or seeds that might 
have clung to him while he was 
outside. 

He passed on into the building. 

A moment later Lieutenant 
Fulton hurried up to the door. He 
yanked off his hiking boots and 
stepped onto the first mat he saw. 

The mat folded over his feet. 

“Hey,” Fulton cried. “Let go!” 

He tried to pull his feet loose, 
but the mat refused to let go. 
Fulton became scared. He drew 
his gun, but he didn't care to fire 
at his own feet. 

“Help!” he shouted. 

Two soldiers came running up. 
“What’s the matter. Lieutenant?” 

“Get this damn thing off me.” 

The soldiers began to laugh. 

“It’s no joke,” Fulton said, his 
face suddenly white. “It’s break- 
ing my feet! It’s — ” 

He began to scream. The sol- 
diers grabbed frantically at the 
mat. Fulton fell, rolling and twist- 
ing, still screaming. At last the 



soldiers managed to get a corner 
of the mat loose from his feet. 

Fulton’s feet were gone. Noth- 
ing but limp bone remained, al- 
ready half-dissolved. 

“\[OW we know,” Hall said 
^ grimly. “It’s a form of or- 
ganic life.” 

Commander Morrison turned 
to Corporal Tenner. “You saw 
two mats when you came into the 
building?” 

“Yes, Commander. Two. I step- 
ped on — on one of them. And 
came in.” 

“You were lucky. You stepped 
on the right one.” 

“We’ve got to be careful,” Hall 
said. “We’ve got to watch for 
duplicates. Apparently it, what- 
ever it is, imitates objects it finds. 
Like a chameleon. Camouflage.” 
“Two,” Stella Morrison mur- 
mured, looking at the two vases 
of flowers, one at each end of her 
desk. “It’s going to be hard to 
tell. Two towels, two vases, two 
chairs. There may be whole rows 
of things that are all right. All 
multiples legitimate except one.” 
“That’s the trouble. I didn’t 
notice anything unusual in the 
lab. There’s nothing odd about 
another microscope. It blended 
right in.” 

The Commander drew away 
from the identical vases of flow- 
ers. “How about those? Maybe 
one is — whatever they are.” 



150 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



“There’s two of a lot of things. 
Natural pairs. Two boots. Cloth- 
ing. Furniture. I didn’t notice 
that extra chair in my room. 
Equipment. It’ll be impossible to 
be sure. And sometimes — ” 

The vidscreen lit. Vice-Com- 
mander Wood’s features formed. 
“Stella, another casualty.” 

“Who is it this time?” 

“An officer dissolved. All but a 
few buttons and his blast pistol 
— Lieutenant Dodds.” 

“That makes three,” Com- 
mander Morrison said. 

“If it’s organic, there ought to 
be some way we can destroy it,” 
Hall muttered. “We’ve already 
blasted a few, apparently killed 
them. They can be hurt! But we 
don’t know how many more there 
are. We’ve destroyed five or six. 
Maybe it’s an infinitely divisible 
substance. Some kind of proto- 
plasm.” 

“And meanwhile — ?” 
“Meanwhile we’re all at its 
mercy. Or their mercy. It’s our 
lethal life form, all right. That 
explains why we found every- 
thing else harmless. Nothing 
could compete with a form like 
this. We have mimic forms of our 
own, of course. Insects, plants. 
And there’s the twisty slug on 
Venus. But nothing that goes this 
far.” 

“It can be killed, though. You 
said so yourself. That means we 
have a chance.” 



“If it can be found.” Hall look- 
ed around the room. Two walk- 
ing capes hung by the door. Had 
there been two a moment tfefore? 

He rubbed his forehead wearily. 
“We’ve got to try to find some 
sort of poison or corrosive agent, 
something that’ll destroy them 
wholesale. We can’t just sit and 
wait for them to attack us. We 
need something we can spray. 
That’s the way we got the twisty 
slugs.” 

The Commander gazed past 
him, rigid. 

He turned to follow her gaze. 
“What is it?” 

“I never noticed two briefcases 
in the corner over there. There 
was only one before — I think.” 
She shook her head in bewilder- 
ment. “How are we going to 
know? This business is getting 
me down.” 

“You need a good stiff drink.” 

She brightened. “That’s an 
idea. But — ” 

“But what?” 

“I don’t want to touch any- 
thing. There’s no way to tell.” 
She fingered the blast gun at her 
waist. “I keep wanting to use it, 
on everything.” 

“Panic reaction. Still, we are 
being picked off, one by one.” 

/^APTAIN Unger got the 
^ emergency call over his head- 
phones. He stopped work at once, 
gathered the specimens he had 



COLONY 



151 



collected in his arms, and hurried 
back toward the bucket. 

It was parked closer than he 
remembered. He stopped, puz- 
zled. There it was, the bright lit- 
tle cone-shaped car with its treads 
firmly planted in the soft soil, its 
door open. 

Unger hurried up to it, carry- 
ing his specimens carefully. He 
opened the storage hatch in the 
back and lowered his. armload. 
Then he went around to the front 
and slid in behind the controls. 

He turned the switch. But the 
motor did not come on. That was 
strange. While he was trying to 
figure it out, he noticed some- 
thing that gave him a start. 

A few hundred feet away, 
among the trees, was a second 
bucket, just like the one he was 
in. And that was where he re- 
membered having parked his car. 
Of course, he was in the wrong 
bucket. Somebody else had come 
looking for specimens, and this 
bucket belonged to him. 

Unger started to get out again. 

The door closed around him. 
The seat folded up over his head. 
The dashboard became plastic 
and oozed. He gasped — he was 
suffocating. He struggled to get 
out, flailing and twisting. There 
was wetness all around him, a 
bubbling, flowing wetness, warm 
like flesh. 

“Glub.” His head was covered. 
His body was covered. The buck- 



et was turning to liquid. He tried 
to pull his hands free but they 
would not come. 

And then the pain began. He 
was being dissolved. All at once 
he realized what the liquid was. 

Acid. Digestive acid. He was 
in a stomach. 

“T\ON’T look!” Gail Thomas 
cried. 

“Why not?” Corporal Hen- 
dricks swam toward her, grinning. 
“Why can’t I look?” 

“Because I’m going to get out.” 

The sun shone down onto the- 
lake. It glittered and danced on 
the water. All around huge moss- 
covered trees rose up, great silent 
columns among the flowering 
vines and bushes. 

Gail climbed up on the bank, 
shaking water from her, throwing 
her hair back out of her eyes. The 
woods were silent. There was no 
sound except the lapping of the 
waves. They were a long way 
from the unit camp. 

“When can I look?” Hendricks 
demanded, swimming around in 
a circle, his eyes shut. 

“Soon.” Gail made her way 
into the trees, until she came to 
the place where she had left her 
uniform. She could feel the warm 
sun glowing against her bare 
shoulders and arms. Sitting down 
in the grass, she picked up her 
tunic and leggings. 

She brushed the leaves and bits 



152 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



of tree bark from her tunic and 
began to pull it over her head. 

In the water, Corporal Hen- 
dricks waited patiently, continu- 
ing in his circle. Time passed. 
There was no sound. He opened 
his eyes. Gail was nowhere in 
sight. 

“Gail?” he called. 

It was very quiet. 

"Gail!” 

No answer. 

Corporal Hendricks swam rap- 
idly to the bank. He pulled him- 
self out of the water. One leap 
carried him to his own uniform, 
neatly piled at the edge of the 
lake. He grabbed up his blaster. 
“Gedl!” 

The woods were silent. There 
was no sound. He stood, looking 
around him, frowning. Gradually, 
a cold fear began to numb him, in 
spite of the warm sun. 

"Gail! GAIL!” 

And still there was only silence. 

C OMMANDER Morrison was 
worried. “We’ve got to act,” 
she said. "We can’t wait. Ten 
lives lost already from thirty en- 
counters. One-third is too high 
a percentage.” 

Hall looked up from his work. 
“Anyhow, now we know what 
we’re up against. It’s a form of 
protoplasm, with infinite versa- 
tility.” He lifted the spray tank. 
“I think this will give us an idea 
of how many exist.” 



“What’s that?” 

“A compound of arsenic and 
hydrogen in gas . form. Arsine.” 

"What are you going to do 
with it?” 

Hall locked his helmet into 
place. His voice came through 
the Commander’s earphones. “I’m 
going to release this throughout 
the lab. I think there are a lot of 
them in here, more than any- 
where else.” 

"Why here?” 

"This is where all samples and 
specimens were originally 
brought, where the first one of 
them was encountered. I think 
they came in with the samples, 
or as the samples, and then in- 
filtrated through the rest of the 
buildings.” 

The Commander locked her 
own helmet into place. Her four 
guards did the same. “Arsine is 
fatal to human beings, isn’t it?” 

Hall nodded. “We’ll have to be 
careful. We can use it in here for 
a limited test, but that’s about 
all.” 

He adjusted the flow of oxygen 
inside his helmet. 

“What’s your test supposed to 
prove?” she wanted to know. 

“If it shows anything at all, it 
should give us an idea of how 
extensively they’ve infiltrated. 
We’ll know better what we’re 
up against. This may be more 
serious than we realize.” 

“How do you mean?” she ask- 



COLONY 



153 



ed, fixing her own oxygen flow. 

“There are a hundred people 
in this unit on Planet Blue. As 
it stands now, the worst that can 
happen is that they’ll get all of 
us, one by one. But that’s noth- 
ing. Units of a hundred are lost 
every day of the week. It’s a risk 
whoever is first to land on a 
planet must take. In the final 
analysis, it’s relatively unimpor- 
tant.” 

“Compared to what?” 

“If they are infinitely divisi- 
ble, then we’re going to have to 
think twice about leaving here. 
It would be better to stay and 
get picked off one by one than 
to run the risk of carrying any 
of them back to the system.” 

CHE looked at him. “Is that 
^ what you’re trying to find out 
— whether they’re infinitely divis- 
ible?” 

“I’m trying to find out what 
we're up against. Maybe there 
are only a few of them. Or maybe 
they’re everywhere.” He waved 
a hand around the laboratory. 
“Maybe half the things in this 
room are not what we think they 
are . It’s bad when they at- 
tack us. It would be worse if 
they didn’t.” 

“Worse?” The Commander was 
puzzled. 

“Their mimicry is perfect. Of 
inorganic objects, at least. I look- 
ed through one of them, Stella, 



when it was imitating my micro- 
scope. It enlarged, adjusted, re- 
flected, just like a regular micro- 
scope. It’s a form of mimicry that 
surpasses anything we’ve ever 
imagined. It carries down below 
the surface, into the actual ele- 
ments of the object imitated.” 

“You mean one of them could 
slip back to Terra along with us? 
In the form of clothing or a piece 
of lab equipment?” She shudder- 
ed. 

“We assume they’re some sort 
of protoplasm. Such malleability 
suggests a simple original form 
— and that suggests binary fis- 
sion. If that’s so, then there may 
be no limit to their ability to 
reproduce. The dissolving proper- 
ties make me think of the simple 
unicellular protozoa.” 

“Do you think they’re intelli- 
gent?” 

“I don’t know. I hope not.” 
Hall lifted the spray. “In any 
case, this should tell us their ex- 
tent. And, to some degree, cor- 
roborate my notion that they’re 
basic enough to reproduce by 
simple division — the worst thing 
possible, from our standpoint. 

“Here goes,” Hall said. 

He held the spray tightly 
against him, depressed the trigger, 
aimed the nozzle slowly around 
the lab. The Commander and the 
four guards stood silently behind 
him. Nothing moved. The sun 
shone in through the windows, 



154 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



reflecting from the culture dishes 
and equipment. 

After a moment he let the trig- 
ger up again. 

“I didn’t see anything,” Com- 
mander Morrison said. “Are you 
sure you did anything?” 

“Arsine is colorless. But don’t 
loosen your helmet. It’s fatal. And 
don’t move.” 

They stood waiting. 

For a time nothing happened. 
Then— 

“Good God!” Commander 
Morrison exclaimed. 

A T the far end of the lab a 
slide cabinet wavered sud- 
denly. It oozed, buckling and 
pitching. It lost its shape com- 
pletely — a homogenous jellylike 
mass perched on top of the table. 
Abruptly it flowed down the side 
of the table onto the floor, wob- 
bling as it went. 

“Over there!” 

A bunsen burner melted and 
flowed along beside it. All around 
the room, objects were in motion. 
A great glass retort folded up into 
itself and settled down into a 
blob. A rack of test tubes, a shelf 
of chemicals . 

“Look out!” Hall cried, step- 
ping back. 

A huge bell jar dropped with 
a soggy splash in front of him. 
It was a single large cell, all 
right. He could dimly make out 
the nucleus, the cell wall, the 



hard vacuoles suspended in the 
cytoplasm. 

Pipettes, tongs, a mortar, all 
were flowing, now. Half the equip- 
ment in the room was in motion. 
They had imitated almost every- 
thing there was to imitate. For 
every microscope there was a 
mimic. For every tube and jar 
and bottle and flask . 

One of the guards had his 
blaster out. Hall knocked it 
down. “Don’t fire! Arsine is in- 
flammable. Let’s get out of here. 
We know what we wanted to 
know.” 

They pushed the laboratory 
door open quickly and made their 
way out into the corridor. Hall 
slammed the door' behind them, 
bolting it tightly. 

“Is it bad, then?” Commander 
Morrison asked. 

“We haven’t got a chance. The 
arsine disturbed them; enough of 
it might even kill them. But we 
haven’t got that much arsine. 
And, if we could flood the planet, 
we wouldn’t be able to use our 
blasters.” 

“Suppose we left the planet.” 

“We can’t take the chance of 
carrying them back to the sys- 
tem.” 

“If we stay here we’ll be ab- 
sorbed, dissolved, one by one,” 
the Commander protested. 

“We could have arsine brought 
in. Or some other poison that 
might destroy them. But it would 



COLONY 



155 




GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



156 



destroy most of the life on the 
planet along with them. There 
wouldn’t be much left.” 

“Then we’ll have to destroy all 
life-forms! If there’s no other way 
of doing it we’ve got to burn the 
planet clean. Even if there 
wouldn’t be a thing left but a 
dead world.” 

They looked at each other. 
“I’m going to call the Sys- 
tem Monitor,” Commander Mor- 
rison said. “I’m going to get the 
unit off here, out of danger — all 
that are left, at least. That poor 
girl by the lake . .” She shud- 
dered. “After everyone’s out of 
here, we can work out the best 
way of cleaning up this planet.” 
“You’ll run the risk of carrying 
one of them back to Terra?” 
“Can they imitate us? Can they 
imitate , living creatures? Higher 
life-forms?” 

Hall considered. “Apparently 
not. They seem to be limited to 
inorganic objects.” 

The Commander smiled grimly. 
“Then we’ll go back without any 
inorganic material.” 

“But our clothes! They can 
imitate belts, gloves, boots — ” 
“We’re not taking our clothes. 
We’re going back without any- 
thing. And I mean without any- 
thing at all.” 

Hall’s lips twitched. “I see.” 
He pondered. “It might work. 
Can you persuade the personnel 
to — to leave all their things be- 



hind? Everything they own?” 

“If it means their lives, I can 
order them to do it.” 

“Then it might be our one 
chance of getting away.” 

rjlHE nearest cruiser large 
•*- enough to remove the remain- 
ing members of the unit was just 
two hours distance away. It was 
moving Terra-side again. 

Commander Morrison looked 
up from the vidscreen. “They 
want to know what’s wrong here.” 
“Let me talk.” Hall seated him- 
self before the screen. The heavy 
features and gold braid of a Ter- 
ran cruiser captain regarded him. 
“This is Major Lawrence Hall, 
from the Research Division of 
this unit.” 

“Captain Daniel Davis.” Cap- 
tain Davis studied him without 
expression. “You’re having some 
kind of trouble, Major?” 

Hall licked his lips. “I’d rather 
not explain until we’re aboard, 
if you don’t mind.” 

“Why not?” 

“Captain, you’re going to think 
we’re, crazy enough as it is. We’ll 
discuss everything fully once 
we’re aboard.” He hesitated. 
“We’re going to board your ship 
naked.” 

The Captain raised an eye- 
brow. “Naked?” 

“That’s right.” 

“I see.” Obviously he didn’t. 
“When will you get here?” 



COLONY 



157 



“In about two hours, I’d say.” 
“It’s now 13:00 by our sched- 
ule. You’ll be here by 15:00?” 
“At approximately that time,” 
the captain agreed. 

“We’ll be waiting for you. 
Don’t let any of your men out. 
Open one lock for us. We’ll board 
without any equipment. Just our- 
selves, nothing else. As soon as 
we’re aboard, remove the ship at 
once.” 

Stella Morrison leaned toward 
the screen. “Captain, would it be 
possible for — for your men to — ?” 
“We’ll land by robot control,” 
he assured her. “None of my men 
will be on deck. No one will see 
you.” 

“Thank you,” she murmured. 
“Not at all.” Captain Davis 
saluted. “We’ll see you in about 
two hours then, Commander.” 
“Let’s get everyone out onto 
the field,” Commander Morrison 
said. “They should remove their 
clothes here, I think, so there 
won’t be any objects on the field 
to come in contact with the ship.” 
Hall looked at her face. “Isn’t 
it worth it to save our lives?” 

“I suppose so,” she said. 

¥ IEUTENANT Friehdly bit his 
lips. “I won’t do it. I’ll stay 
here." 

“You have to come.” 

“But, Major — ” 

Hall looked at his watch. “It’s 
14:50. The ship will be here any 



minute. Get your clothes off and 
get out on the landing field.” 

“Can’t I take anything at all?" 

“Nothing. Not even your 
blaster . They’ll give us clothes 
inside the ship. Come on! Your 
life depends on this. Everyone 
else is doing it.” 

Friendly tugged at his shirt re- 
luctantly. “Well, I guess I’m act- 
ing silly.” 

The vidscreen clicked. A robot 
voice announced shrilly: “Every- 
one out of the buildings at once! 
Everyone out of the buildings and 
on the field without delay! Every- 
one out of the buildings at once! 
Everyone — ” 

“So soon?” Hall ran to the win- 
dow and lifted the metal blind. 
“I didn’t hear it land.” 

Parked in the center of the 
landing field was a long gray 
cruiser, its hull pitted and dented 
from meteoric strikes. It lay mo- 
tionless. There was no sign of life 
about it. 

A crowd of naked people was 
already moving hesitantly across 
the field toward it, blinking in the 
bright sunlight. 

“It’s here!” Hall started tearing 
off his shirt. “Let’s go!” 

“Wait for me!” 

“Then hurry.” Hall finished un- 
dressing. Both men hurried out 
into the corridor. Unclothed 
guards raced past them. They 
padded down the corridors, 
through the long unit building. 



158 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



to the door. They ran downstairs, 
out on the field. Warm sunlight 
beat down on them from the sky 
overhead. From all the unit build- 
ings, naked men and women were 
pouring silently toward the ship. 

“What a sight!” an officer said. 
'‘We’ll never be able to live it 
down.” 

“But you’ll live, at least,” an- 
other said. 

“Lawrence !” 

Hall half-turned. 

“Please don’t look around. 
Keep on going. I’ll walk behind 
you.” 

“How does it feel, Stella?” Hall 
asked. 

“Unusual.” 

“Is it worth it?” 

“I suppose so.” 

“Do you think anyone will be- 
lieve us?” 

“I doubt it,” she said. “I’m be- 
ginning to wonder myself.” 
“Anyhow, we’ll get back alive.” 
“I guess so.” 

TTALL looked up at the ramp 
being lowered from the ship 
in front of them. The first people 
were already beginning to scam- 
per up the metal incline, into the 
ship, through the circular lock. 
“Lawrence — ” 

There was a peculiar tremor in 
the Commander’s voice. “Law- 
rence, I’m — ” 

“You’re what?” 

“I’m scared.” 



“Scared!” He stopped. “Why?” 
“I don’t know,” she quavered. 
People pushed against them 
from all sides. “Forget it. Carry- 
over from your early childhood.” 
He put his foot on the bottom of 
the ramp. “Up we go.” 

“I want to go back!” There was 
panic in her voice. “I — ” 

Hall laughed. “It’s too late 
now, Stella.” He mounted the 
ramp, holding on to the rail. 
Around him, on all sides, men 
and women were pushing for- 
ward, carrying them up. They 
came to the lock. “Here we are.” 
The man ahead of him disap- 
peared. 

Hall went inside after him, into 
the dark interior of the ship, into 
the silent blackness before him. 
The Commander followed. 

AT exactly 15:00 Captain 
Daniel Davis landed his ship 
in the center of the field. Relays 
slid the entrance lock open with 
a bang. Davis and the other offi- 
cers of the ship sat waiting in the 
control cabin, around the big con- 
trol table. 

“Well,” Captain Davis said, 
after a while, “where are they?” 
The officers became uneasy. 
“Maybe something’s wrong.” 
“Maybe the whole damn thing’s 
a joke!” 

They waited and waited. 

But no one came.

SECRETS ENTRUSTED TO 



T HERE ARE some things that can not be generally told— things you 
ought to know. Great truths are dangerous to some— but factors for 
persona] power and accomplishment in the hands of those who under* 
stand them. Behind the tales of the miracles and mysteries of the 
ancients, lie centuries of their secret probing into nature's laws— their 
amazing discoveries of the hidden processes of man's mind, and the 
mastery of life's problems. Once shrouded in mystery to avoid their 
destruction by mass fear and ignorance, these facts remain a useful 
heritage for the thousands of men and women who privately use them 
in their homes today.
