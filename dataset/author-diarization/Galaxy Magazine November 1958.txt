THE TIN AGE 



A tomic Age, space Age, Au- 
tomated Age— whatever name 
is finally chosen for our multiplex 
era, it should certainly not exclude 
the astonishing tin can. Only by 
being so taken for granted could it 
have grown to a statistical marvel: 
the 42 billion cans used a year in 
the U. S. alone weigh, empty, 
4,600,000 tons, a consumption of 
steel exceeded only by the auto- 
mobile and construction industries, 
and sealed within these metal con- 
tainers are more than 2,000 differ- 
ent and sometimes unbelievable 
items — food, of course, but also 
motorcycles, tennis balls and Gei- 
ger counters, books, bikes, shaving 
cream, spray-on bandages, these 
are just a handful snatched from 
a list that grows by night as well as 
day, for research is forever finding 
ways of canning things that had 
never been thought cannable be- 
fore. 

The tin can was born in the 
13th century, when medieval arti- 
sans discovered that by dipping a 
sheet of iron into molten tin, they 
could stop corrosion and rust. The 
next step took 500 years; in 1795, 
the revolutionary French govern- 
ment offered a 12,000 franc prize 



to anyone who could preserve food 
effectively, for the army suffered 
more casualties from food poison- 
ing and diet deficiencies than from 
enemy muskets. Nicholas Appert, 
a Parisian confectioner, pickier 
and vintner, accepted the chal- 
lenge, but he needed fourteen 
years to conquer it. In 1809, Na- 
poleon gratefully gave the award 
to Appert, who had packed his 
food like vintage wines. He par- 
tially cooked the food, then placed 
it in bottles, which were corked, 
wired, and submerged in boiling 
water. Appert had unwittingly 
sterilized his food. 

The process worked, but the 
fragile glass containers often broke 
in transit. A year later, an Eng- 
lishman, Peter Durand, revived the 
medieval discovery and developed 
the “canister,” an iron container 
plated with tin, with a soldered 
cover. The tin can came to Amer- 
ica in 1819 when another English- 
man, William Underwood, built 
a successful business by canning 
such Eastern delicacies as lobster 
and cranberries for the homesick 
pioneers who were settling the 
West. Underwood’s clerks quickly

THE CIVILIZATION GAME 



By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



F or some time, Stanley Pax- 
ton had been hearing the 
sound of muffled explosions 
from the west. But he had kept 
on, for there might be a man be- 
hind him, trailing him, and he 
could not change his course. For if 
he was not befuddled, the home- 
stead of Nelson Moore lay some- 
where in the hills ahead. There he 
would find shelter for the night 
and perhaps even transportation. 
Communication, he knew, must 
be ruled out for the moment; the 
Hunter people would be monitor- 
ing, alert for any news of him. 

One Easter vacation, many 
years ago, he had spent a few 
days at the Moore homestead, 
and all through this afternoon he 
had been haunted by a sense of 
recognition for certain landmarks 
he had sighted. But his visit to 
these hills had been so long ago 
that his memory hazed and there 
was no certainty. 

As the afternoon had length- 
ened toward an early evening, his 
fear of the trailing man began to 
taper off. Perhaps, he told him- 
self, there was no one, after all. 
Once, atop a hill, he had crouched

in a thicket for almost half an 
hour and had seen no sign of any 
follower. 

Long since, of course, they 
would have found the wreckage of 
his flier, but they might have ar- 
rived too late and so, consequently, 
have no idea in which direction he 
had gone. 

Through the day, he’d kept 
close watch of the cloudy sky and 
was satisfied that no scouting flier 
had passed overhead to spot him. 

Now, with the setting of the 
sun behind an angry cloud bank, 
he felt momentarily safe. 

TTE came out of a meadow val- 
ley and began to climb a 
wooded hill. The strange boom- 
ings and concussions seemed fair- 
ly close at hand and he could see 
the flashes of explosions lighting 
up the sky. 

He reached the hilltop and 
stopped short, crouching down 
against the ground. Below him, 
over a square mile or more of 
ground, spread the rippling flashes, 
and in the pauses between the 
louder noises, he heard faint chat- 
terings that sent shivers up his 
spine. 

He crouched, watching the 
flashes ripple back and forth in 
zigzag patterning and occasionally 
a small holocaust of explosions 
would suddenly break out and 
then subside as quickly. 

Slowly he stood up and wrapped 



his cloak about him and raised 
the hood to protect his neck and 
ears. 

On the near side of the flashing 
area, at the bottom of the hill, 
was some sort of foursquare struc- 
ture looming darkly in the dusk. 
And it seemed as well that a mas- 
sive hazy bowl lay inverted above 
the entire area, although it was 
too dark to make out what it was. 

Paxton grunted softly to him- 
self and went quickly down the 
hill until he reached the build- 
ing. It was, he saw, a sort of ob- 
servation platform, solidly con- 
structed and raised well above the 
ground, with the top half of it 
made of heavy glass that ran all 
the way around. A ladder went up 
one side to the glassed-in platform. 

“What’s going on up there?” he 
shouted, but his voice could be 
scarcely heard above the crashing 
and thundering that came from 
out in front. 

So he climbed the ladder. 

When his head reached the level 
of the glassed-in platform area, 
he halted. A boy, not more than 
fourteen years of age, stood at the 
front of the platform, staring out 
into a noisy sea of fire. A pair 
of binoculars was slung about his 
neck and to one side of him stood 
a massive bank of instruments. 

Paxton clambered up the rest 
of the way and stepped inside the 
platform. 

“Hello, young man!” he shouted.

GALAXY 



The youngster turned around. 
He seemed an engaging fellow, 
with a cowlick down his forehead. 

“I’m sorry, sir,” he said. “I’m 
afraid I didn’t hear you.” 

“What is going on here?” 

“A war,” said the boy. “Pertwee 
just launched his big attack. I’m 
hard-pressed to hold him off.” 

■pAXTON gasped a little. “But 
this is most unusual!” he pro- 
tested. 

The boy wrinkled up his fore- 
head. “I don’t understand.” 

“You are Nelson Moore’s son?” 
“Yes, sir, I am Graham Moore.” 
“I knew your father many years 
ago. We went to school together.” 
“He will be glad to see you, 
sir,” the boy said brightly, sens- 
ing an opportunity to rid himself 
of this uninvited kibitzer. “You 
take the path just north of west. 
It will lead you to the house.” 
“Perhaps,” suggested Paxton, 
“you could come along and show 
me.” 

“I can’t leave just yet,” said 
Graham. “I must blunt Pertwee’s 
attack. He caught me off my bal- 
ance and has been saving up his 
firepower and there were some 
maneuvers that escaped me until 
it was too late. Believe me, sir, I’m 
in an unenviable position.” 

“This Pertwee?” 

“He’s the enemy. We’ve fought 
for two years now.” 

“I see,” said Paxton solemnly 



and retreated down the ladder. 

He found the path and followed 
it and found the house, set in a 
swale between two hillocks. It 
was an old and rambling affair 
among great clumps of trees. 

The path ended on a patio and 
a woman’s voice asked; “Is that 
you, Nels?” 

She sat in a rocking chair on 
the smooth stone flags and was 
little more than a blur of white- 
ness— a white face haloed by white 
hair. 

“Not Nels,” he said. “An old 
friend of your son’s.” 

From here, he noticed, through 
some trick of acoustics in the 
hills, one could barely hear the 
sound of battle, although the sky 
to the east was lighted by an oc- 
casional flash of heavy rockets or 
artillery fire. 

“We are glad to have you, sir,” 
the old lady said, still rocking 
gently back and forth. “Although 
I do wish Nelson would come 
home. I don’t like him wandering 
around after it gets dark.” 

“My name is Stanley Paxton. 
I’m with Politics.” 

“Why, yes,” she said, “I re- 
member now. You spent an Easter 
with us, twenty years ago. I’m 
Cornelia Moore, but you may call 
me Grandma, like all the rest of 
them.” 

“I remember you quite well,” 
said Paxton. “I hope I’m not in- 
truding.”

“Heavens, no. We have few 
visitors. We’re always glad to see 
one. Theodore especially will be 
pleased. You’d better call him 
Granther.” 

“Granther?” 

“Grandfather. That’s the way 
Graham said it when he was a 
tyke.” 

“I met Graham. He seemed to 
be quite busy. He said Pertwee 
had caught him off his balance.” 

“That Pertwee plays too rough,” 
said Grandma, a little angrily. 

4 ROBOT catfooted out onto 
the patio. “Dinner is ready, 
madam,” it said. 

“We’ll wait for Nelson,” Grand- 
ma told it. 

“Yes, madam. He should be in 
quite soon. We shouldn’t wait too 
long. Granther has already started 
on his second brandy.” 

“We have a guest, Elijah. Please 
show him to his room. He is a 
friend of Nelson’s.” 

“Good evening, sir,” Elijah 
said. “If you will follow me. And 
your luggage. Perhaps I can car- 
ry it.” 

“Of course you can,” said Grand- 
ma drily. “I wish, Elijah, you’d 
stop putting on airs when there’s 
company.” 

“I have no luggage,” Paxton 
said,, embarrassed. 

He followed the robot across the 
patio and into the house, going 
down the central hall and up the 



very handsome winding staircase. 

The room was large and filled 
with old-fashioned furniture. A 
sedate fireplace stood against one 
wall. 

“I’ll light a fire,” Elijah said. “It 
gets chilly in the autumn, once the 
sun goes down. And damp. It 
looks like rain.” 

Paxton stood in the center of 
the room, trying to remember. 

Grandma was a painter and 
Nelson was a naturalist, but what 
about old Granther? 

“The old gentleman,” said the 
robot, stooping at the fireplace, 
“will send you up a drink. He’ll 
insist on brandy, but if you wish it, 
sir, I could get you something 
else.” 

“No, thank you. Brandy will be 
fine.” 

“The old gentleman’s in great 
fettle. He’ll have a lot to tell you. 
He’s just finished his sonata, sir, 
after working at it for almost 
seven years, and he’s very proud 
of it. There were times, I don’t 
mind telling you, when it was go- 
ing badly, that he wasn’t fit to 
live with. If you’d just look here 
at my bottom, sir, you can see a 
dent . .” 

“So I see,” said Paxton uncom- 
fortably. 

The robot rose from before the 
fireplace and the flames began 
to crackle, crawling up the wood. 

“I’ll go for your drink,” Elijah 
said. “If it takes a little longer 



8 



GALAXY 



than seems necessary, do not be- 
come alarmed. The old gentle- 
man undoubtedly will take this 
opportunity to lecture me about 
hewing to civility, now that we 
have a guest.” 

Paxton walked to the bed, took 
off his cloak and hung it on a 
bedpost. He walked back to the 
fire and sat down in a chair, 
stretching out his legs toward the 
warming blaze. 

It had been wrong of him to 
come here, he thought. These peo- 
ple should not be involved in his 
problems and his danger. Theirs 
was the quiet world, the easygoing, 
thoughtful world, while his world 
of Politics was all clamor and ex- 
citement and sometimes agony 
and fear. 

He’d not tell them, he decided. 
And he’d stay just the night and 
be off before the dawn. Somehow 
or other he would work out a way 
to get in contact with his party. 
Somewhere else he’d find people 
who would help him. 

^ I ^HERE was a knock at the 
door. Apparently it had not 
taken Elijah as long as it had 
thought. 

“Come in,” Paxton called. 

It was not Elijah; it was Nel- 
son Moore. 

He still wore a rough walking 
jacket and his boots had mud upon 
them and there was a streak of 
dirt across his face where he’d 

THE CIVILIZATION GAME 



brushed back his hair with a grimy 
hand. 

“Grandma told me you were 
here,” he said, shaking Paxton by 
the hand. 

“I had two weeks off,” said Pax- 
ton, lying Tike a gentleman. “We 
just finished with an exercise. It 
might interest you to know that 
I was elected President.” 

“Why, that is fine,” said Nelson 
enthusiastically. 

“Yes, I suppose it is.” 

“Let’s sit down.” 

“I’m afraid I may be holding 
up the dinner. The robot said—” 
Nelson laughed. “Elijah always 
rushes us to eat. He wants to get 
the day all done and buttoned up. 
We’ve come to expect it of him 
and we pay him no attention.” 
“I’m looking forward to meet- 
ing Anastasia,” Paxton said. “I 
remember that you wrote of her 
often and—” 

“She’s not here,” said Nelson. 
“She— well, she' left me. Almost 
five years ago. She missed Out- 
side too much. None of us should 
marry outside Continuation.” 

“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have—” 
“It’s all right, Stan. It’s all done 
with now. There are some who 
simply do not fit into the project. 
I’ve wondered many, times, since 
Anastasia left, what kind of folks 
We are. I’ve wondered if it all is 
worth it.” 

“All of us think that way at 
times,” said Paxton. “There have 

9 



been times when I’ve been forced 
to fall back on history to find some 
shred of justification for what 
we’re doing here. There’s a paral- 
lel in the monks of the so-called 
Middle Ages. They managed to 
preserve at least part of the knowl- 
edge of the Hellenic world. For 
their own selfish reasons, of course, 
as Continuation has its selfish rea- 
sons, but the human race was the 
real beneficiary.” 

“I go back to history, too,” said 
Nelson. “The one that I come up 
with is a Stone Age savage, hid- 
den off in some dark corner, busily 
flaking arrows while the first space- 
ships are being launched. It all 
seems so useless, Stan. .” 

“On the face of it, I suppose it 
is. It doesn’t matter in the least 
that I was elected President in our 
just-finished exercise. But there 
may be a day when that knowl- 
edge and technique of politics may 
come in very handy. And when it 
does, all the human race will have 
to do is come back here to Earth 
and they have the living art. This 
campaign that I waged was a dirty 
one. Nelson. I’m not proud of it.” 
“There’s a good deal of dirty 
things in the human culture,” Nel- 
son said, “but if we commit our- 
selves at all, it must be all the 
way — the vicious with the noble, 
the dirty with the splendid.” 

The door opened quietly and 
Elijah glided in. It had two glasses 
on. a tray. 



“I heard you come in,” it said 
to Nelson, “so I brought you some- 
thing, too.” 

“Thank you,” Nelson said. 
“That was kind of you.” 

Elijah shuffled in some embar- 
rassment. “If you don’t mind, 
could you hurry just a little? The 
old gentleman has almost killed 
the bottle. I’m afraid of what 
might happen to him if I don’t 
get him to the table.” 

II 

THINNER had been finished and 
young Graham hustled off 
to bed. Granther unearthed, with 
great solemnity, another bottle of 
good brandy. 

“That boy is a caution,” he de- 
clared. “I don’t know what’s to 
become of him. Imagine him out 
there all day long, fighting those 
fool battles. If he was going to 
take up something, I should think 
he’d want it to be useful. There’s 
nothing more useless than a gen- 
eral when there are no wars.” 
Grandma clacked her teeth to- 
gether with impatience. “It isn’t 
as if we hadn’t tried. We gave 
him every chance there was. But 
he wasn’t interested in anything 
until he took up warring.” 

“He’s got guts,” said Granther 
proudly. “That much I’ll say for 
him. He up and asked me the 
other day would I write him some 
battle music. Me!” yelled Gran- 



10 



GALAXY 



ther, thumping his chest. “Me write 
battle music!” 

“He’s got the seeds of destruc- 
tion in him,” declared Grandma 
righteously. “He doesn’t want to 
build. He just wants to bust.” 
“Don’t look at me,” Nelson said 
to Paxton. “I gave up long ago. 
Granther and Grandma took him 
over from me right after Anas- 
tasia left. To hear them talk, you’d 
think they hated him. But let me 
lift a finger to him and the both 
of them—” 

“We did the best we could,” 
said Grandma. “We gave him 
every chance. We bought him all 
the testing kits. You remember?” 
“Sure,” said Granther, busy with 
the bottle. “I remember well. We 
bought him that ecology kit and 
you should have seen the planet 
he turned out. It was the most 
pitiful, down-at-heels, hungover 
planet you ever saw. And then 
we tried robotry— ” 

“He did right well at that,” said 
Grandma tartly. 

“Sure, he built them. He en- 
joyed building them. Recall the 
time he geared the two of them 
to hate each other and they fought 
until they were just two piles of 
scrap? I never saw anyone have 
such a splendid time as Graham 
during the seven days they fought.” 
“We could scarcely get him in 
to meals,” said Grandma. 

Granther handed out the 
brandy. 



“But the worst of all,” he de- 
cided, “was the time we tried 
religion. He dreamed up a cult 
that was positively gummy. We 
made short work of that . .” 
“And the hospital,” said Grand- 
ma. “That was your idea, Nels . .” 
“Let’s not talk about,” pleaded 
Nelson grimly. “I am sure Stanley 
isn’t interested.” 

"DAXTON picked up the cue 
Nelson was offering him. “I 
was going to ask you. Grandma, 
what kind of painting you are 
doing. I don’t recall that Nelson 
ever told me.” 

“Landscapes,” the sweet-faced 
old lady said. “I’ve been doing 
some experimenting.” 

“And I tell her she is wrong,” 
protested Granther. “To experi- 
ment is wrong. Our job is to main- 
tain tradition, not to let our work 
go wandering off in whatever di- 
rection it might choose.” 

“Our job,” said Grandma bitter- 
ly, “is to guard the techniques. 
Which is not to say we cannot 
strive at progress, if it still is hu- 
man progress. Young man,” she 
appealed to Paxton, “isn’t that the 
way you see it?” 

“Well, in part,” evaded Pax- 
ton, caught between two fires. “In 
Politics, we allow evolvement, 
naturally, but we make sure by 
periodic tests that we are develop- 
ing logically and in the human 
manner. And we make very sure 



THE CIVILIZATION GAME 



11 



we do not drop any of the old 
techniques, no matter how out- 
moded they may seem. And the 
same is true in Diplomacy. I hap- 
pen to know a bit about Diploma- 
cy, because the two sections work 
very close together and—” 
“There!” Grandma said. 

“You know what I think?” said 
Nelson quietly. “We are a fright- 
ened race. For the first time in our 
history, the human race is a mi- 
nority and it scares us half to 
death. We are afraid of losing our 
identity in the great galactic ma- 
trix. We’re afraid of assimilation.” 
“That’s wrong, son,” Granther 
disagreed. “We are not afraid, my 
boy. We’re just awful smart, that’s 
all. We had a great culture at 
one time and why should we give 
it up? Sure, most humans nowa- 
days have adopted the galactic 
way of life, but that is not to say 
that it is for the best. Some day 
we may want to turn back to the 
human culture or we may find that 
later on we can use parts of it. 
And this way, if we keep it alive 
here in Project Continuation, it 
will be available, all of it or any 
part, any time we need it. And 
I’m not speaking, mind you, from 
the human view alone, because 
some facet of our culture might 
sometime be badly needed, not by 
the human race as such, but by 
the Galaxy itself.” 

“Then why keep the project 
secret?” 



“I don’t think it’s really secret,” 
Granther said. “It’s just that no 
one pays much attention to the 
human race and none at all to 
Earth. The human race is pretty 
small potatoes against all the rest 
of them and Earth is just a worn- 
out planet that doesn’t amount to 
shucks.” 

He asked Paxton: “You ever 
hear it was secret, boy?” 

“Why, I guess not,” said Paxton. 
“All I ever understood was that 
we didn’t go around shooting off 
our mouths about it. I’ve thought 
of Continuation as a sort of sacred 
trust. We’re the guardians who 
watch over the tribal medicine 
bag while the rest of humanity 
is out among the stars getting civi- 
lized.” 

T he old man chortled. “That’s 
about the size of it. We’re just 
a bunch of bushmen, but mark 
me well, intelligent and even dan- 
gerous bushmen.” 

“Dangerous?” asked Paxton. 
“He means Graham,” Nelson 
told him quietly. 

“No, I don’t,” said Granther. 
“Not him especially. I mean the 
whole kit and caboodle of us. Be- 
cause, don’t you see, everybody 
who joins in this galactic culture 
that they are stewing up out there 
must contribute something and 
must likewise give up something 
— things that don’t fit in with the 
new ideas. And the human race 



12 



GALAXY 



has done just like the rest of them, 
except we haven’t given up a 
thing. Oh, on the surface, certain- 
ly. But everything we’ve given 
up is still back here, being kept 
alive by a bunch of subsidized 
barbarians on an old and gutted 
planet that a member of this fine 
galactic culture wouldn’t give a 
second look.” 

“He’s horrible,” said Grandma. 
“Don’t pay attention to him. He’s 
got a mean and ornery soul in- 
side that withered carcass.” 

“And what is Man?” yelled 
Granther. “He’s mean and ornery, 
too, when he has to be. How could 
we have gone so far if we weren’t 
mean and ornery?” 

And there was some truth in 
that, thought Paxton. For what 
humanity was doing here was de- 
liberate doublecrossing. Although, 
come to think of it, he wondered, 
how many other races might be 
doing the very selfsame thing or 
its equivalent? 

And if you were going to do it, 
you had to do it right. You couldn’t 
take the human culture and en- 
shrine it prettily within a museum, 
for then it would become no more 
than a shiny showpiece. A fine dis- 
play of arrow heads was a pretty 
thing to look at, but a man would 
never learn to chip a flint into an 
arrow head by merely looking at a 
bunch of them laid out on a vel- 
vet-covered board. To retain the 
technique of chipping arrows. 



you’d have to keep on chipping ar- 
rows, generation after generation, 
long after the need of them was 
gone. Fail by one generation and 
the art was lost. ^ 

And the same necessarily must 
be true of other human techniques 
and other human arts. And not 
the purely human arts alone, but 
the unique human flavor of other 
techniques which in themselves 
were common to many other races. 

Elijah brought in an armload of 
wood and dumped it down upon 
the hearth, heaped an extra log or 
two upon the fire, then brushed 
itself off carefully. 

“You’re wet,” said Grandma. 

“It’s raining, madam,” said Eli- 
jah, going out the door. 

4 ND so, thought Paxton, Proj- 
ect Continuation kept on 
practicing the old arts, retaining 
within a living body of the race 
the knowledge of their manipula- 
tion and their use. 

So the section on politics prac- 
ticed politics and the section on 
diplomacy set up seemingly im- 
possible problems in diplomacy 
and wrestled with those problems. 
And in the project factories, teams 
of industrialists carried on in the 
old tradition and fought a never- 
ending feud with the trade union- 
ism teams. And, scattered through- 
out the land, quiet men and 
women painted and composed and 
wrote and sculped so that the

culture that had been wholly hu- 
man would not perish in the face 
of the new and wonderful galactic 
culture that was evolving from 
the fusion of many intelligences 
out in the farther stars. 

And against what day, won- 
dered Paxton, do we carry on thisi 
work? Is it pure and simple, and 
perhaps even silly, pride? Is it 
no more than a further expression 
of human skepticism and human 
arrogance? Or does it make the 
solid sense that old Granther thinks 
it does? 

“You’re in Politics, you say,” 
Granther said to Paxton. “Now 
that is what I’d call a worthwhile 
thing to save. From what I hear, 
this new culture doesn’t pay too 
much attention to what we call 
politics. There’s administration, 
naturally, and a sense of civic duty 
and all that sort of nonsense— but 
no real politics. Politics can be a 
powerful thing when you need to 
win a point.” 

“Politics is a dirty business far 
too often,” Paxton answered. “It’s 
a fight for power, an effort to over- 
ride and overrule the principles 
and policies of an opposing body. 
In even its best phase, it brought 
about the fiction of the minority, 
with the connotation that the mere 
fact of being a minority carries 
with it the penalty of being to a 
large extent ignored.” 

“Still, it could be fun. I suppose 
it is exciting.” 



“Yes, you could call it that,” 
said Paxton. “This last exercise 
we carried out was one with no 
holds barred. We had it planned 
that way. It was described some- 
what delicately as a vicious battle.” 
“And you were elected Presi- 
dent,” said Nelson. 

“That I was, but you didn’t hear 
me say I was proud of it.” 

“But you should be,” Grandma 
insisted. “In the ancient days, it 
was a proud thing to be elected 
President.” 

“Perhaps,” Paxton admitted, 
“but not the way my party did it.” 

TT would be so easy, he thought, 
to go ahead and tell them, 
for they would understand. To 
say: I carried it too far. I black- 
ened my opponent’s name and 
character beyond any urgent need. 
I used all the dirty tricks. I bribed 
and lied and compromised and 
traded. And I did it all so well that 
I even fooled the logic that was 
the referee, which stood in lieu of 
populace and voter. And now my 
opponent has dug up another trick 
and is using it on me. 

For assassination was political, 
even as diplomacy and war were 
political. After all, politics was lit- 
tle more than the short-circuiting 
of violence; an election was held 
rather than a revolution. But at 
all times the partition between 
politics and violence was a thin 
and flimsy thing.

He finished off his brandy and 
put the glass down on the table. 

Granther picked up the bottle, 
but Paxton shook his head. 

“Thank you,” he said. “If you 
don’t mind, I shall go to bed soon. 
I must get an early start.” 

He never should have stopped 
here. It would be unforgivable to 
embroil these people in the after- 
math of the exercise. 

Although, he told himself, it 
probably was unfair to call it the 
aftermath — what was happening 
would have to be a part and parcel 
of the exercise itself. 

The doorbell tinkled faintly and 
they could hear Elijah stirring in 
the hall. 

“Sakes alive,” said Grandma, 
“who can it be this time of night? 
And raining outdoors, too!” 

It was a churchman. 

He stood in the hall, brushing 
water from his cloak. He took off 
his broad-brimmed hat and 
swished it to shake off the rain- 
drops. 

He came into the room with a 
slow and stately tread. 

All of them arose. 

“Good evening. Bishop,” said 
old Granther. “You were fortu- 
nate to find the house in this kind 
of weather and we’re glad to have 
Your Worship.” 

The bishop beamed in fine, fast 
fellowship. 

“Not of the church,” he said. 
“Of the project merely. But you 



may use the proper terms, if you 
have a mind. It helps me stay in 
character.” 

Elijah, trailing in his wake, took 
his cloak and hat. The bishop was 
arrayed in rich and handsome gar- 
ments. 

Granther introduced them all 
around and found a glass and 
filled it from the bottle. 

The bishop took it and smacked 
his lips. He sat down in a chair 
next to the fire. 

“You have not' dined, I take 
it,” Grandma said. “Of course you 
haven’t— there’s no place out therei 
to dine. Elijah, get the bishop a 
plate of food, and hurry.” 

“I thank you, madam,” said the 
bishop. “I’ve had a long, hard day. 
I appreciate all you’re doing for 
me. I appreciate it more than you 
can ever know.” 

“This is our day,” Granther said 
merrily, refilling his own glass for 
the umpteenth time. “It is sel- 
dom that we have any guests at all 
and now, all of an evening, we 
have two of them.” 

“Two guests,” said the bishop, 
looking straight at Paxton. “Now 
that is fine, indeed.” 

He smacked his lips again and 
emptied the glass. 

Ill 

TN his room, Paxton closed the 
door and shot the bolt full 
home.

The fire had burned down to 
embers and cast a dull glow along 
the floor. The rain drummed faint- 
ly, half-heartedly, on the window 
pane. 

And the question and the fear 
raced within his brain. 

There was no question of it: 
The bishop was the assassin who 
had been set upon his trail. 

No man without a purpose, and 
a deadly purpose, walked these 
hills at night, in an autumn rain. 
And what was more, the bishop 
had been scarcely wet. He’d 
shaken his hat and the drops had 
fallen off, and he’d brushed at 
his cloak and after that both the 
hat and cloak were dry. 

The bishop had been brought 
here, more than likely, in a hover- 
ing flier and let down, as other 
assassins probably likewise had 
been let down this very night in 
all of half a dozen places where a 
fleeing man might have taken 
shelter. 

The bishop had been taken to 
the room just across the hall and 
under other circumstances, Paxton 
told himself, he might have sought 
conclusions with him there. He 
walked over to the fireplace and 
picked up the heavy poker and 
weighed it in his hand. One stroke 
of that and it would be all over. 

But he couldn’t do it. Not in 
this house. 

He put the poker back and 
walked over to the bed and picked 



up his cloak. Slowly he slid it on 
as he stood there, thinking, going 
over in his mind the happenings 
of the morning. 

He had been at home, alone, 
and the phone had rung and Sulli- 
van’s face had filled the visor — 
a face all puffed up with fright. 

“Hunter’s out to get you,” Sul- 
livan had said. “He’s sent men to 
get you.” 

“But he can’t do that!” Paxton 
remembered protesting. 

“Certainly he can,” said Sul- 
livan. “It comes within the 
framework of the exercise. Assassi- 
nation has always been a possibil- 
ity . .” 

“But the exercise is finished!” 

“Not so far as Hunter is con- 
cerned. You went a little far. You 
should have stayed within the 
hypothesis of the problem; there 
was no need to go back into Hun- 
ter’s personal affairs. You dug up 
things he thought no one ever 
knew. How did you do it, man?” 

“I have my ways,” said Pax- 
ton. “And in a deal like this, 
everything was fair. He didn’t 
handle me exactly as if I were 
innocent.” 

“You better get going,” Sullivan 
advised. “They must be almost 
there. I can’t get anyone there 
soon enough to help you.” 

4 ND it would have been all 
right, Paxton thought, if the 
flier had only held together. 



THE CIVILIZATION GAME

He wondered momentarily if 
it had been sabotaged. 

But be that as it may, he had 
flown it down and had been able 
to walk away from it and now, 
finally, here he was. 

He stood irresolutely in the cen- 
ter of the room. 

It went against his pride to flee 
for a second time, but there was 
nothing else to do. He couldn’t 
let this house become involved in 
the tag-end rough and tumble of 
his exercise. 

And despite the poker, he was 
weaponless, for weapons on this 
now-peaceful planet were very 
few indeed — no longer household 
items such as once had been the 
case. 

He went to the window and 
opened it and saw that the rain 
had stopped and that a ragged 
moon was showing through a scud 
of racing clouds. 

^ LANCING down, he saw the 
'^roof of the porch beneath the 
window and he let his eye follow 
down the roof line. Not too hard, 
he thought, if a man were bare- 
foot, and once he reached the edge 
there’d be a drop of not much 
more than seven feet. 

He took off his sandals and 
stuffed them in the pocket of his 
cloak and started out the window. 

But, halfway out, he climbed 
back in again and walked to the 
door. Quietly he slid back the 



bolt. It wasn’t exactly cricket to 
go running off and leave a room 
locked up. 

The roof was slippery with the 
rain, but he managed it without 
any trouble, inching his way care- 
fully down the incline. He dropped 
into a shrub that scratched him up 
a bit, but that, he told himself, 
was a minor matter. 

He put on his sandals and 
straightened up and walked rapid- 
ly away. At the edge of the woods, 
he stopped and looked back at 
the house. It stood dark and 
silent. 

Once he got back home and 
this affair was finished, he prom- 
ised himself, he’d write Nelson a 
long apologetic letter and explain 
it all. 

His feet found the path and he 
followed it through the sickly 
half-light of the cloudy moon. 

“Sir,” said a voice close beside 
him, “I see that you are out for 
a little stroll . .” 

Paxton jumped in fright. 

“It’s a nice night for it, sir,” 
the voice went on quietly. “After a 
rain, everything seems so clean 
and copl.” 

“Who is there?” asked Paxton, 
with his hair standing quite on 
edge. 

“Why, it’s Pertwee, sir. Pertwee, 
the robot, sir.” 

Paxton laughed a little nervous- 
ly. “Oh, yes, I remember now. 
You’re Graham’s enemy.” 



18 



GALAXY 



^I^HE robot stepped out of the 
woods into the path beside 
him. 

“It’s too much, I suppose,” Pert- 
wee said, “to imagine that you 
might be coming out to look at 
the battlefield.” 

“Why, no,” said Paxton, grasp- 
ing at a straw. “I don’t know how 
you guessed it, but that’s exactly 
what I’m doing. I’ve never heard 
of an5dhing quite like it and I’m 
considerably intrigu^ed.” 

“Sir,” said the robot eagerly, 
“I’m entirely at your service. 
There is no one, I can assure you, 
who is better equipped to explain 
it to you. I’ve been in it from t}ie 
very first with Master Ghaham, 
and if you have any questions, I 
shall try to answer them.” 

“Yes, I think there is one ques- 
tion. What is the purpose of it 
all?” 

“Why, at first, of course,” said 
Pertwee, “it was simply an at- 
tempt to amuse a growing boy. 
But now, with your permission, 
sir, I would venture the opinion 
that it is a good deal more.” 

“You mean a part of Continu- 
ation?” 

“Certainly, sir. I know there is a 
natural reluctance among human- 
kind to admit the fact, or to even 
think about it, but for a great 
part of Man’s history war played 
an important and many-sided 
role. Of all the arts that Man 
developed, there probably was 



none to which he devoted so much 
time and thought and money as 
he did to war.” 

The path sloped down and there 
before them in the pale and mot- 
tled moonlight lay the battle bowl. 

“That bowl,” asked Paxton, “or 
whatever it might be that you 
have tipped over it? Sometimes 
you can just make it out and 
other times you miss it . .” 

“I suppose,” said Pertwee, 
“you’d call it a force shield, sir. A 
couple of the other robots worked 
it out. As I understand it, sir, 
it is nothing new — just an adap- 
tation. There’s a time factor 
worked into it as an additional 
protection.” 

“But that sort of protection . .” 

‘We use TC bombs, sir— total 
conversion bombs. Each side gets 
so many of them and uses his 
best judgment and . .” 

“But you couldn’t use nuclear 
stuff in there!” 

“As safe as a toy, sir,” said 
Pertwee gaily. “They are very 
small, sir. Not much larger than 
a pea. Critical mass, as you well 
understand, no longer is much of 
a consideration. And the yield in 
radiation, while it is fairly high, is 
extremely short-lived, so that with- 
in an hour or so . .” 

“You gentlemen,” said Paxton 
grimly, “certainly try to be en- 
tirely realistic.” 

“Why, yes, of course we do. 
Although the operators are entire- 



THE CIVILIZATION GAME 



19 



ly safe. We’re in the same sort of 
position, you might say, as the 
general staff. And that is all right, 
of course, because the purpose of 
the entire business is to keep alive 
the art of waging war.” 

“But the art . Paxton started 
to argue, then stopped. 

XfTHAT could he say? If the 
** race persisted in its purpose 
of keeping the old culture work- 
able and intact in Continuation, 
then it must perforce accept that 
culture in its entirety. 

War, one must admit, was as 
much a part of the human culture 
as were all the other more or less 
uniquely human things that the 
race was conserving here as a sort 
of racial cushion against a future 
need or use. 

“There is,” confessed Pertwee, 
“a certain cruelty, but perhaps a 
cruelty that I, as a robot, am more 
alive to than would be the case 
with a human, sif. The rate of 
casualties among the robot troops 
is unbelievable. In a restricted 
space and with extremely high 
firepower, that would be the 
natural consequence.” 

“You mean that you use troops 
—that you send robots in there?” 
“Why, yes. Who else would 
operate the weapons? And it 
would be just a little silly, don’t 
you think, to work out a battle 
and then . .” 

“But robots . 



“They are very small ones, sir. 
They would have to be, to gain 
an illusion of the space which is 
normally covered by a full-scale 
battle. And the weapons likewise 
are scaled down, and that sort of 
evens things out. And the troops 
are very single-minded, complete- 
ly obedient and dedicated to vic- 
tory. We turn them out in mass 
production in our shops and there’s 
little chance to give them vary- 
ing individualities and anyhow . .” 
“Yes, I see,” said Paxton, a 
little stunned. “But now I think 
that I . .” 

“But, sir, I have only got a 
start at telling you and I’ve not 
shown you anything at all. There 
are so many considerations and 
there were so many problems.” 
They were close to the tower- 
ing, fully shimmering force field 
now and Pertwee pointed to a 
stairway that led from ground 
level down toward its base. 

“I’d like to show you, sir,” said 
Pertwee, ducking down the stairs. 
It stopped before a door. 
“This,” it said, “is the only en- 
trance to the battlefield. We use 
it to send new troops and mu- 
nitions during periods of truce, and 
at other times we use it to police 
up the place a bit.” 

Its thumb stabbed out and hit 
a button to one side of the door 
and the door moved upward si- 
lently. 

“After several weeks of battle,” 



20

the robot explained, “the terrain is 
bound to become a little cluttered.” 

T hrough the door, Paxton 
could see the churned-up 
ground and the evidence of dying, 
and it was as if someone had 
pushed him in the belly. He gulped 
in a stricken breath and couldn’t 
let it out and he suddenly was 
giddy and nearly sick. He put out 
a hand to hold himself upright 
against the trenchlike wall beside 
him. 

Pertwee pushed another button 
and the door slid down. 

“It hits you hard the first time 
you see it,” Pertwee apologized, 
“but given time, one gets used to 
it.” 

Paxton let his breath out slow- 
ly and looked around. The trench 
with the stairway came down to 
the door, and the door, he saw, 
was wider than the trench, so that 
at the foot of the steps the area 
had been widened into a sort of 
letter T, with narrow embrasures 
scooped out to face the door. 

“You all right, sir?” asked Pert- 
wee. 

“Perfectly all right,” Paxton 
told the robot stiffly. 

“And now,” said Pertwee hap- 
pily, “I’ll explain the fire and tac- 
tical control.” 

It trotted up the steps and 
Paxton trailed behind it. 

“I’m afraid that would take too 
long,” said Paxton. 



But the robot brushed the words 
aside. “You must see it, sir,” it 
pleaded plaintively. “Now that 
you are out here, you must not 
miss seeing it.” 

He’d have to get away some- 
how, Paxton told himself. He 
couldn’t afford to waste much 
time. As soon as the house had 
settled down to sleep, the bishop 
would come hunting him, and by 
that time he must be gone. 

Pertwee led the way around the 
curving base of the battle bowl 
to the observation tower which 
Paxton had come upon that even- 
ing. 

The robot halted at the base of 
the ladder. 

“After you,” it said. 

Paxton hesitated, then went 
swiftly up the ladder. 

Maybe this wouldn’t take too 
long, he thought, and then he 
could be off. It would be better, he 
realized, if he could get rid of 
Pertwee without being too abrupt 
about it. 

The robot brushed past him in 
the darkness and bent above the 
bank of controls. There was a 
snick and lights came on in the 
panels. 

“This, you see,” it said, “is the 
groundglass — a representation of 
the battlefield. It is dead now, of 
course, because there is nothing 
going on, but when there is some 
action certain symbols are im- 
posed upon the field so that one 



THE CIVILIZATION GAME 



21 



can see at all times just how things 
are going. And this is the fire con- 
trol panel and this is the troop 
command panel and this . 

Pertwee went on and on with 
his explanations. 

Finally it turned in triumph 
from the instruments. 

“What do you think of it?” the 
robot asked, very clearly expect- 
ing praise. 

“Why, it’s wonderful,” said Pax- 
ton, willing to say anything to 
make an end of his visit. 

“If you are going to be around 
tomorrow,” Pertwee said, “you 
may want to watch us.” 

And it was then that Paxton 
got his inspiration. 

IV 

A S a matter of fact,” Paxton 
said, “I’d like to try it out. 
In my youth, I did a bit of read- 
ing on military mattets, and if 
you’ll excuse my saying so, I have 
often fancied myself somewhat of 
an expert.” 

Pertwee brightened almost vis- 
ibly. “You mean, sir, that you’d 
like to go one round with me?” 
“If you’d be so kind.” 

“You are sure you understand 
how to operate the board?” 

“I watched you very closely.” 
“Give me fifteen minutes to 
reach my tower,” said Pertwee. 
‘When I arrive, I’ll press the ready 
button. After that, either of us can 



start hostilities any time we widi.” 

“Fifteen minutes?” 

“It may not take me that long, 
sir. I’ll be quick about it.” 

“And I’m not imposing on you?” 

“Sir,” Pertwee said feelingly, 
“it will be a pleasure. I’ve fought 
against young Master Graham un- 
til the novelty has worn off. We 
know one another’s tactics so well 
that there’s little chance for sur- 
prise. As you can understand, sir, 
that makes for a rather humdrum 
war.” 

“Yes,” said Paxton, “I suppose 
it would.” 

He watched Pertwee go down 
the ladder and listened to its foot- 
steps hurrying away. 

Then he went down the ladder 
and stood for a moment at the 
foot of it. 

The clouds had thinned con- 
siderably and the moonlight was 
brighter now and it would be easier 
traveling, although it still would be 
dark in the denser forest. 

He swung away from the tower 
and headed for the path, and, as 
he did so, he caught a flicker of 
motion in a patch of brush just off 
the trail. 

Paxton slid into the denser 
shadow of a clump of trees and 
watched the patch of brush. 

He crouched and waited. There 
was another cautious movement 
in the brush and he saw it was 
the bishop. Now suddenly it 
seemed that there was a chance 



22 



GALAXY 



to get the bishop off his neck for 
good — if his inspiration would 
only pay off. 

The bishop had been let down 
by the flier in the dark of night, 
with the rain still pouring down 
and no moonlight at all. So it was 
unlikely that he knew about the 
battle bowl, although more than 
likely he must see it now, glit- 
tering faintly in the moonlight. 
But even if he saw it, there was a 
chance he’d not know what it was. 

Paxton thought back along the 
conversation there had been after 
the bishop had arrived and no 
one, so far as he remembered, had 
mentioned a word of young 
Graham or the war project. 

There was, Paxton thought, 
nothing lost by trying. Even if it 
didn’t work, all he’d lose would be 
a little time. 

He darted from the clump of 
trees to reach the base of the 
battle bowl. He crouched against 
the ground and watched, and the 
bishop came sliding out of his 
clump of brush and worked his 
way along, closing in upon him. 

And that was fine, thought Pax- 
ton. It was working just the way 
he’d planned. 

TTE moved a little to make ab- 
solutely sure his trailer would 
know exactly where he was and 
then he dived down the stairs that 
led to the door. 

He reached it and thumbed the 



button and the door slid slowly 
upward without a single sound. 
Paxton crowded back into the 
embrasure and waited. 

It took a little longer than he 
had thought it would and he was 
getting slightly nervous when he 
heard the step upon the stairs. 

The bishop came down slowly, 
apparently very watchful, and 
then he reached the door and 
stood there for a moment, staring 
out into the churned-up battlefield. 
And in his hand he held an ugly 
gun. 

Paxton held his breath and 
pressed his shoulders tight against 
the wall of earth, but the bishop 
didn’t even look around. His eyes 
were busy taking in the ground 
that lay beyond the door. 

Then finally he moved, quick- 
ly, like a leopard. His silken gar- 
ments made a swishing noise as he 
stepped through the door and out 
into the battle area. 

Paxton held himself motionless, 
watching the bishop advance cau- 
tiously out into the field, and when 
he was far enough, he reached out 
a finger and pressed the second 
button and the door came down, 
smoothly, silently. 

Paxton leaned against the door 
and let out in a gasp the breath he 
had been holding. 

It was over now, he thought. 

Hunter hadn’t been as clever 
as he had thought he was. 

Paxton turned from the door 



THE CIVILIZATION GAME 



23 



and went slowly up the stairs. 

Now he needn’t run away. He 
could stay right here and Nelson 
would fly him, or arrange to have 
him flown, to some place of safety. 

For Hunter wouldn’t know that 
this particular assassin had hunted 
down his quarry. The bishop had 
had no chance to communicate 
and probably wouldn’t have dared 
to even if he could. 

On the top step, Paxton stubbed 
his toe and went down without a 
chance to catch himself, and there 
was a vast explosion that shook 
the universe and artillery fire was 
bursting in his brain. 

Dazed, he got to his hands and 
knees and crawled painfully, hurl- 
ing himself desperately down the 
stairs — and through the crashing 
uproar that filled the entire world 
ran an urgent thought and pur- 
pose: 

I’ve got to get him out before 
it is too late! I can’t let him die 
in there! I can’t kill a man! 

TLTE slipped on the stairs and slid 
until his body jammed in the 
narrowness and stuck. 

And there was no artillery fire, 
there was no crash of shells, no 
wicked little chitterings. The dome 
glittered softly in the moonlight 
and was as quiet as death. 

Except, he thought, a little 
weirdly, death’s not quiet in there. 
It is an inferno of destruction and 
a maddening place of sound and 



brightness and the quietness 
doesn’t come until afterward. 

He’d fallen and hit his head, he 
knew, and all he’d seen and heard 
had been within his brain. But 
Pertwee would be opening up any 
minute now and the quietness 
would be gone, and with it the 
opportunity to undo what he had 
so swiftly planned. 

And somewhere in the shadow 
of the dome another self stood off 
and argued with him, jeering at 
his softness, quoting logic at him. 

It was either he or you, said 
that other self. You fought for 
your life the best way you knew, 
the only way you knew, and what- 
ever you may have done, no mat- 
ter what you did, you were entire- 
ly justified. 

“I can’t do it!” yelled the Pax- 
ton on the stairs and yet even as 
he yelled he knew that he was 
wrong, that by logic he was wrong, 
that the jeering self who stood off 
in the shadows made more sense 
than he. 

He staggered to his feet. With- 
out his conscious mind made up, 
he went down the stairs. Driven by 
some as yet unrealized and unde- 
fined instinctive prompting that 
was past all understanding, he 
stumbled down the stairs, with the 
throb still in his head and a chok- 
ing guilt and fear rising in his 
throat. 

He reached the door and 
stabbed the button and the door

slid up and he went out into the 
cluttered place of dying and 
stopped in horror at the awful 
loneliness and the vindictive deso- 
lation of this square mile of Earth 
that was shut off from all the other 
Earth as if it were a place of 
final judgment. 

And perhaps it was, he thought 
— the final judgment of Man. 

Of all of us, he thought, young 
Graham may be the only honest 
one; he’s the true barbarian that 
old Granther thinks he is; he is 
the throwback who looks out upon 
Man’s past and sees it as it is and 
lives it as it was. 

Paxton took a quick look back 
and he saw the door was closed 
and out ahead of him, in the 
plowed and jumbled sea of tor- 
tured, battered earth, he saw a 
moving figure that could be no 
one but the bishop. 

Paxton ran forward, shouting, 
and the bishop turned around and 
stood there, waiting, with the gun 
half lifted. 

Paxton stopped and waved his 
arms in frantic signaling. The 
bishop’s gun came up and there 
was a stinging slash across the side 
of Paxton’s neck and a sudden, 
gushing wetness. A small, blue 
puff of smoke hung on the muzzle 
of the distant gun. 

"OAXTON flxmg himself aside 
and dived for the ground. He 
hit and skidded on his belly and 



tumbled most ingloriously into a 
dusty crater. He lay there, at the 
bottom of the crater, huddled 
against the fear of a bullet’s im- 
pact while the rage and fury built 
up into white heat. 

He had come here to save a 
man and the man had tried to kill 
him! 

I should have, left him here, he 
thought. 

I should have let him die. 

I’d kill him if I could. 

And the fact of the matter now 
was that he had to kill the bishop. 
There was no choice but to kill 
him or be killed himself. 

Not only did he have to kill the 
bishop, but he had to kill him 
soon. Pertwee’s fifteen minutes 
must be almost at an end and the 
bishop had to be killed and he had 
to be out the door before Pertwee 
opened fire. 

Out the door, he thought — did 
he have a chance? If he ran low 
and dodged, perhaps, would he 
have a chance to escape the bish- 
op’s bullets? 

That was it, he thought. Waste 
no time on killing if he didn’t 
have to; let Pertwee do the killing. 
Just get out of here himself. 

He put his hand up to his neck, 
and when he lifted it, his fingers 
were covered with a sticky wet- 
ness. It was funny, he thought, 
that it didn’t hurt, although the 
hurt, no doubt, would come later. 

He crawled up the crater’s side 



THE CIVILIZATION GAME 



25 




and rolled across its lip and found 
himself lying in a small, massed 
junkyard of smashed and broken 
robots, sprawled grotesquely where 
the barrage had caught them. 

And lying there in front of him, 
without a scratch upon it, where 
it had fallen from a dying robot’s 
grasp, was a rifle that shone dully 
in the moonlight. 

He snatched it up and rose into 
a crouch and as he did he saw 



the bishop, almost on top of him; 
the bishop coming in to make 
sure that he was finished! 

There was no time to run, as 
he had planned to — and, curious- 
ly, no desire to run. Paxton had 
never known actual hate before, 
never had a chance to know it, but 
now it came and filled him full 
of rage and a wild and exultant 
will and capacity to kill without 
pity or remorse. 



26 



GALAXY 




He tilted up the rifle and his 
finger closed upon the trigger and 
the weapon danced and flashed 
and made a deadly chatter. 

T>UT the bishop still came on, 
not rushing now, but plod- 
ding ahead with a deadly stride, 
leaning forward as if his body 
were absorbing the murderous rifle 
fire, absorbing it and keeping on 
by will power alone, holding off 



death until that moment when it 
might snuff out the thing that was 
killing it. 

The bishop’s gun came up and 
something smashed into Paxton’s 
chest, and smashed again and yet 
agai'n, and there was a flood of 
wetness and a spattering and the 
edge of Paxton’s brain caught at 
the hint of something wrong. 

For two men do not — could 
not — stand a dozen feet apart and 



THE CIVILIZATION GAME 



27 




pour at one another a deadly blast 
and both stay on their feet. No 
matter how poor might be their 
aim, it simply couldn’t happen. 

He rose out of his crouch and 
stood at his full height and let 
the gun hang uselessly in his hand. 
Six feet away, the bishop stopped 
as well and flung his gun away. 

They stood looking at one an- 
other in the pale moonlight and 
the anger melted and ran out of 
them and Paxton wished that he 
were almost anywhere but there. 

“Paxton,” asked the bishop 
plaintively, “who did this to us?” 

And it was a funny thing to 
say, almost as if he’d said: “Who 
stopped us from killing one an- 
other?” 

For a fleeting moment, it al- 
most seemed to Paxton as though 
it might have been a kinder thing 
if they had been allowed to kill. 
For killing was a brave thing in 
the annals of the race, an art of 
strength and a certain proof of 
manhood — perhaps of human- 
hood. 

A kinder thing to be allowed to 
kill. And that was it, exactly. They 
had not been allowed to kill. 

For you couldn’t kill with a 
pop-gun that shot out plastic pel- 
lets of liquid that burst on con- 
tact, with the liquid running down 
like blood for the sake of realism. 
And you couldn’t kill with a gun 
that went most admirably through 
all the motions of chattering and 



smoking and flashing out red fire, 
but with nothing lethal in it. 

And was this entire battle bowl 
no more than a toy set with robots 
that came apart at the right and 
most dramatic moments and then 
could be put back together at a 
later time? Were the artillery and 
the total-conversion bombs toy 
things as well, with a lot of flash 
and noise and perhaps a few well- 
placed items to plow up the battle- 
field, but without the power to 
really hurt a robot? 

^T^HE bishop said, “Paxton, I 
feel like an utter fool.” And he 
added other words which a real 
bishop could never bring himself 
to say, making very clear just 
what kind of obscene fool he was. 

“Let’s get out of here,” said 
Paxton shortly, feeling like that 
same kind of fool himself. 

“I wonder . .” said the bishop. 

“Forget about it,” Paxton 
growled. “Let’s just get out of here. 
Pertwee will be opening up . .” 

But he didn’t finish what he 
was about to say, for he realized 
that even if Pertwee did open up, 
there’d be little danger. And there 
wasn’t any chance that Pertwee 
would open up, for it would know 
that they were here. 

Like a metal monitor watching 
over a group of rebellious chil- 
dren — rebellious because they 
weren’t adult yet. Watching them 
and letting them go ahead and

GALAXY 



play so long as they were in no 
danger of drowning or of falling 
off a roof or some other reckless 
thing. And then interfering only 
just enough to save their silly 
necks. Perhaps even encouraging 
them to play so they’d work off 
their rebelliousness — joining in 
the game in the typically human 
tradition of let’s pretend. 

Like monitors watching over 
children, letting them develop, alf 
lowing them to express their fool- 
ish little selves, not standing in the 
way of whatever childish impor- 
tance they could muster up, en- 
couraging them to think they were 
sufficient to themselves. 

TJAXTON started for the door, 
■*- plodding along, the bishop in 
his bedraggled robes stumbling 
along behind him. 

When they were a hundred feet 
away, the door started sliding up 
and Pertwee stood there, waiting 
for them, not looking any different 



than it had before, but somehow 
seeming to have a new measure 
of importance. 

They reached the door and 
sheepishly trailed through it, not 
looking right or left, casually and 
elaborately pretending that Pert- 
wee was not there. 

“Gentlemen,” said Pertwee, 
“don’t you want to play?” 

“No,” Paxton said. “No, thank 
you. I can’t speak for both of us—” 
“Yes, you can, friend,” the 
bishop put in. “Go right ahead.” 
“My friend and I have done all 
the playing we care to do,” said 
Paxton. “It was good of you to 
make sure we didn’t get hurt.” 
Pertwee managed to look puz- 
zled. “But why should anybody be 
allowed to get hurt? It was only 
a game.” 

“So we’ve discovered. Which 
way is out?” 

“Why,” said the robot, “any way 
but back.”

When you took pot luck with 
this kitchen scientist, not 
even the poor pot was lucky! 

Illustrated by JOHNSON 



C ONNIE came home from 
school and found her broth- 
er in the kitchen, doing 
something important at the sink. 
She knew it was important be- 
cause he was making a mess and 
talking to himself. The sink drain 
was loaded down with open soda 
bottles, a sack of flour, corn meal, 
dog biscuits, molasses, Bromo- 
Seltzer, a tin of sardines and a 



box of soap chip>s. The floor was 
covered with drippings and every 
cupboard in the kitchen was open. 
At the moment, Bonnie’s brother 
was putting all his energy into 
shaking a plastic juicer that was 
half-filled with an ominous-look- 
ing, frothy mixture. 

Bonnie waited for a moment, 
keeping well out of range, and 
then said, “Hi, Bob.” 



30 



GALAXY 



“Lo,” he answered, without look- 
ing up. 

“Where’s Mom?” 

“Shopping.” 

Bonnie inched a little closer. 
“What are you doing, Bob?” she 
asked. 

“Nothing.” 

“Can I watch?” 

“No.” 

Bonnie took this as a cue to ad- 
vance two cautious steps. She 
knew from experience how close 
she could approach her brother 
when he was being creative and 
still maintain a peaceful neutrali- 
ty. Bob slopped a cupful of 
ketchup into the juicer, added a 
can of powdered mustard, a drop 
of milk, six aspirin and a piece of 
chewing gum, being careful to 
spill a part of each package used. 

Bonnie moved in a bit closer. 
“Are you making another experi- 
ment?” she asked. 

“Who wants to know?” Bob an- 
swered, in his mad-scientist voice, 
as he swaggered over to the re- 
frigerator and took out an egg, 
some old bacon fat, a capsuled 
vitamin pill, yesterday’s Jello and 
a bottle of clam juice. 

“Me wants to know,” said Bon- 
nie, picking up an apple that had 
rolled out of the refrigerator and 
fallen on the floor. 

“Why should I tell you?” 

“I have a quarter.” 

“Where’d you get it?” 

“Mom gave it to me.” 



“If you give it to me. I’ll tell 
you what I’m doing.” 

“It’s not worth it.” 

“I’ll let you be my assistant, 
too.” 

“Still not worth it.” 

“For ten cents?” 

“Okay, ten cents.” 

QHE counted out the money to 
^ her brother and put on an 
apron. “What should I do now. 
Bob?” 

“Get the salt,” Bob instructed. 
He poured sardine oil from the 
can into the juicer, being very 
careful not to let the sardines fall 
in. When he had squeezed the 
last drop of oil out of the can, 
he ate all the sardines and tossed 
the can into the sink. 

Bonnie went after the salt and, 
when she lifted out the box, she 
found a package containing two 
chocolate graham crackers. 

“Mom has a new hiding place. 
Bob,” she announced. 

Bob looked up. “Where is it?” 
“Behind the salt.” 

“What did you find there?” 
“Two chocolate grahams.” 
Bobby held out his hand, ac- 
cepted one of the crackers with- 
out thanks and proceeded to 
crumble the whole thing into his 
concoction, not even stopping to 
lick the chocolate off his hands. 

Bonnie frowned in disbelief. She 
had never seen such self-sacrifice. 
The act made her aware, for the 



PEOPLE SOUP 



31 



first time, of the immense signif- 
icance of the experiment. 

She dropped her quarrel com- 
pletely and walked over to the 
sink to get a good look at what 
was being done. All she saw in the 
sink was a wadded, wet Corn 
Flake box, the empty sardine tin 
and spillings from the juicer, which 
by this time was beginning to take 
on a distinctive and unpleasant 
odor. Bob gave Bonnie the job 
of adding seven pinches of salt 
and some cocoa to the concoction. 

“What’s it going to be, Bob?” 
she asked, blending the cocoa on 
her hands into her yellow cordu- 
roy skirt. 

“Stuff,” Bob answered, unbend- 
ing a little. 

“Government stuff?” 

“Nope.” 

“Spaceship stuff?” 

“Nope.” 

“Medicine?” 

“Nope.” 

“I give up.” 

“It’s animal serum,” Bob said, 
sliced his thumb on the sardine 
can, glanced unemotionally at the 
cut, ignored it. 

“What’s animal serum. Bob?” 
“It’s certain properties without 
which the universe in eternity re- 
gards for human beings.” 

“Oh,” Bonnie said. She took off 
her apron and sat down at the 
other end of the kitchen. The 
smell from the juicer was begin- 
ning to reach her stomach. 



Bobby combed the kitchen for 
something else to throw into his 
concoction and came up with some 
oregano and liquid garlic. 

“I guess this is about it,” he 
said. 

He poured the garlic and ore- 
gano into his juicer, put the lid 
on, shook it furiously for a minute 
and then emptied the contents 
into a deep pot. 

“What are you doing now. Bob?” 
Bonnie asked. 

“You have to cook it for seven 
minutes.” 

Tl OBBY lit the stove, put a 
cover on the pot, set the 
timer for ten minutes and left the 
room. Bonnie tagged after him 
and the two of them got involved 
in a rough game of basketball 
in the living room. 

“BING!” said the timer. 

Bob dropped the basketball on 
Bonnie’s head and ran back into 
the kitchen. 

“It’s all done,” he said, and took 
the cover off the pot. Only his 
dedication to his work kept him 
from showing the discomfort he 
felt with the smell that the pot 
gave forth. 

“Fyew!” said Bonnie. “What do 
we do with it now? Throw it out?” 

“No, stupid. We have to stir it 
till it cools and then drink it.” 

“Drink it?” Bonnie wrinkled her 
nose. “How come we have to drink 
it?”

Bobby said, “Because that’s 
what you do with experiments, 
stupid.” 

“But, Bob, it smells like gar- 
bage.” 

“Medicine smells worse and it 
makes you healthy,” Bob said, 
while stirring the pot with an old 
wooden spoon. 

Bonnie held her nose, stood on 
tiptoe and looked in at the cook- 
ing solution. “Will this make us 
healthy?” 

“Maybe.” Bob kept stirring. 

“What will it do?” 

“You’ll see.” Bob took two clean 
dish towels, draped them around 
the pot and carried it over to the 
formica kitchen table. In the proc- 
ess, he managed to dip both 
towels in the mixture and burn 
his already sliced thumb. One plas- 
tic handle of the pot was still 
smoldering, from being too near 
the fire, but none of these things 
seemed to have the slightest effect 
on him. He put the pot down in 
the middle of the table and stared 
at it, chin in hand. 

Bonnie plopped down opposite 
him, put her chin in her hands 
and asked, “We have to drink that 
stuff?” 

“Yup.” 

“Who has to drink it first?” Bob 
made no sign of having heard. “I 
thought so,” said Bonnie. Still no 
comment. “What if it kills me?” 

Bobby spoke by raising his 
whole head and keeping his jaw 



stationary in his hands. “How can 
it hurt you? There’s nothing but 
pure food in there.” 

Bonnie also sat and stared. 
“How much of that stuff do I 
have to drink?” 

“Just a litle bit. Stick one fin- 
ger in it and lick it off.” 

Bonnie pointed a cautious fin- 
ger at the tarry-looking brew and 
slowly immersed it, until it bare- 
ly covered the nail. “Is that 
enough?” 

“Plenty,” said Bob in a judi- 
cious tone. 

Bonnie took her finger out of 
the pot and stared at it for a mo- 
ment. “What if I get sick?” 

“You can’t get sick. There’s 
aspirin and vitamins in it, too.” 

Bonnie sighed and wrinkled her 
nose. ‘Well, here goes,” she said. 
She licked off a little bit. 

Bob watched her with his tele- 
vision version of a scientific look. 
“How do you feel?” he inquired. 

Bonnie answered, “It’s not so 
bad, once it goes down. You can 
taste the chocolate graham crack- 
er.” Bonnie was really enjoying 
the attention. “Hey,” she said, 
“I’m starting to get a funny feel- 
ing in my—” and, before she could 
finish the sentence, there was a 
loud pop. 

Bob’s face registered extreme 
disappointment. 

She sat quite still for a moment 
and then said, “What happened?” 

“You’ve turned into a chicken.”

GALAXY 



little bird lifted its wings 
and looked down at itself. 
“How come I’m a chicken, Bob?” 
it said, cocking its head to one 
side and staring at him with its 
left eye. 

“Ah, nuts,” he explained. “I ex- 
pected you to be more of a pigeon 
thing.” Bob mulled over the in- 
gredients of his stew to see what 
went wrong. 

The chicken hopped around the 
chair on one leg, flapped its wings 
experimentally and found itself 
on the kitchen table. It walked to 
the far corner and peered into a 
small mirror that hung on the side 
of the sink cabinet. 

“I’m a pretty ugly chicken, boy,” 
it said. 

It inspected itself with its other 
eye and, finding no improvement, 
walked back to Bobby. 

“I don’t like to be a chicken. 
Bob,” it said. 

“Why not? What does it feel 
like?” 

“It feels skinny and I can’t see 
so good.” 

“How else does it feel?” 

“That’s all how it feels. Make 
me stop being it.” 

“First tell me better what it’s 
like.” 

“I told you already. Make me 
stop being it.” 

“What are you afraid of? Why 
don’t you see what it’s like first, 
before you change back? This is 
a valuable experience.” 



The chicken tried to put its 
hands on its hips, but could find 
neither hips nor hands. “You bet- 
ter change me back, boy,” it said, 
and gave Bob the left-eye glare. 

“Will you stop being stupid and 
just see what it’s, like first?” Bob 
was finding it difficult to under- 
stand her lack of curiosity. 

“Wait till Mom sees what an 
ugly mess I am, boy. Will you 
ever get it!” Bonnie was trying 
very hard to see Bob with both 
eyes at once, which was impos- 
sible. 

“You’re a sissy, Bonnie. You 
ruined the opportunity of a life- 
time. I’m disgusted with you.” Bob 
dipped his forefinger in the serum 
and held it toward the chicken. It 
pecked what it could from the 
finger and tilted its head back. 

In an instant, the chicken was 
gone and Bonnie was back. She 
climbed down from the table, 
wiped her eyes and said, “It’s a 
good thing you fixed me, boy. 
Would you ever have got it.” 

“Ah, you’re nothing but a sissy,” 
Bob said, and licked off a whole 
fingerful of his formula. “If I 
change into a horse, I won’t let 
you ride me, and if I change into 
a leopard. I’ll bite your head off.” 
Once again, the loud pop was 
heard. 

C ONNIE stood up, wide-eyed. 

“Oh, Bob,” she said, “you’re 
beautiful!”

“What am I?” Bob asked. 
“You’re a bee-yoo-tee-full St. 
Bernard, Bob! Let’s go show 
Melissa and Chuck.” 

“A St. Bernard?” The animal 
looked disgusted. “I don’t want to 
be no dog. I want to be a leopard.” 
“But you’re beautiful, Bob! Go 
look in the mirror.” 

“Naah.” The dog paddled over 
to the table. 

“What are you going to do, 
Bob?” 

“I’m going to try it again.” 

The dog put its front paws on 
the table, knocked over the serum 
and lapped up some as it dripped 
on the floor. Pop went the serum, 
taking effect. Bobby remained on 
all fours and kept on lapping. Pop 
went the serum again. 

“What am I now?” he asked. 
“You’re still a St. Bernard,” 
said Bonnie. 

“The devil with it then,” said 
the dog. “Let’s forget all about it.” 
The dog took one last lap of 



serum. Pop! Bobby got up from 
the floor and dejectedly started 
out the back door. Bonnie skipped 
after him. 

“What’ll we do now. Bob?” she 
asked. 

“We’ll go down to Thrifty’s and 
get some ice cream.” 

They walked down the hill si- 
lently, Bobby brooding over not 
having been a leopard and Bon- 
nie wishing he had stayed a St. 
Bernard. As they approached the 
main street of the small town, 
Bonnie turned to her brother. 

“You want to make some more 
of that stuff tomorrow?” 

“Not the same stuff,” said Bob. 
“What’ll we make instead?” 

“I ain’t decided yet.” 

“You want to make an atomic 
bomb?” 

“Maybe.” 

“Can we do it in the juicer?” 
“Sure,” Bob said, “only we’ll 
have to get a couple of onions.”

L ike last month’s column, 
this one also deals exclu- 
sively with questions that 
were directed at me recently, either 
by mail or in person, the latter 
usually after lectures and other 
public appearances. They all deal

satellites. I did not select them 
that way; that’s the way they 
came. As a book publisher “con-

fided” to me over lunch: “Interest 
in space travel seems to be high.” 
It is. 

The first question, not the first 
that came to me but the first I 
am going to answer, concerned the 
first spaceship. The wording used 
was “Who designed the first space- 
ship?” and that took me a little 
by surprise since there aren’t any 
yet. Fortunately the meaning of 
the question was explained quick- 
ly. There have been quite a num- 
ber of space travel stories, some a 
good deal more than fifty years 
old, the correspondent continued. 
But these were all stories; their 
authors did not have to defend the 
scientific validity of their descrip- 
tions. But who was the first man 
to design a spaceship and to say 
that he thought space travel pos- 
sible and believed that his design 
could do it? 

The answer to that question is 
that I knew the man who did. 
He was a German inventor by the 
name of Hermann Ganswindt, who 
was a rather aged gentleman at 
the time I met him — he had been 
born on June 12, 1856, and our 
first meeting took place in early 
summer of 1929. 

STRESSING his age at the 
^ time is not supposed to pro- 
duce the impression that I met a 
frail old man, troubled by bad 
health and too many memories. 
Hermann Ganswindt may have 



been sick occasionally during his 
life, as happens to everybody, but 
his health was fine. He was around 
six feet one inch or two inches tall 
and must have weighed more than 
220 pounds. He moved energeti- 
cally and thought nothing of stay- 
ing up until two A.M. His eyes 
were coal black and so was what 
was left of his hair and his beard. 
Just one year before I met him, 
he had become a father for the 
twenty-third time (two marriages) 
and boasted that his youngest son 
was younger than his youngest 
grandchild. He had a voice that 
one would expect of a man his 
size. And though he was full of 
memories, they did not trouble 
him a bit. 

Why I met him is also charac- 
teristic. At that time there were, 
in Germany, two theoretical works 
on space travel. One was by Pro- 
fessor Hermann Oberth (now in 
Huntsville, Alabama) and the 
other was by the late Dr. Walter 
Hohmann (victim of a bombing 
raid in World War II). Profes- 
sor Robert H. Goddard’s book, it 
may be mentioned in passing, was 
known to exist but was not in the 
libraries and could not be bought 
— I tried it twice, once directly 
and once through a bookstore. In 
addition to these two highly tech- 
nical works, there were three pop- 
ularizations, one by Max Valier, 
one by Otto Willi Gail and one 
by Willy Ley. 



38 



GALAXY 



One day Oberth, Valier and 
Gail received letters from Her- 
mann Ganswindt, couched in legal 
language and requesting that he 
be mentioned as a forerunner 
when these books should be re- 
printed. Dr. Hohmann and myself 
did not receive such letters; I 
don’t know why. One of the re- 
sults of these letters was that Otto 
Willi Gail (now also deceased) 
went to see Ganswindt, inter- 
viewed him at length and wrote six 
syndicated newspaper columns 
about him. After they had ap- 
peared, he suggested to me that 
I do the same. 

Before I got around to it, I re- 
ceived an invitation from Fritz 
Lang to have lunch with him at 
the Ufa studios and to see the 
moon landscape he had built for 
the filming of his Girl in the Moon. 
Professor Oberth was there and 
so was Hermann Ganswindt. 
Ganswindt, walking around in the 
scenery, told me and whoever else 
was willing to listen that he had 
invented the following items: the 
dirigible, the helicopter, the horse- 
less carriage, the motorboat, the 
free-wheeling mechanism of the 
bicycle, and the spaceship. This 
was not just boasting; he had 
had early concepts of all these 
things. 

Naturally he was not the first 
to think of a dirigible, but he 
claimed that he had been the first 
to think of one that would have 



worked, if built. (Possibly true.) 
He did believe that he was the 
first to think of a helicopter and 
said that it had failed to work 
merely because he had been xm- 
able to buy a sufficiently power- 
ful engine. In this he was wrong. 
Others had thought of helicopters 
before him and his would not havei 
worked, even with a powerful en- 
gine. Hopelessly unstable, it prob- 
ably would have crashed by side- 
slipping before it reached 20 feet 
altitude. 

Ganswindt also said that he had 
been the first to speak about a 
spaceship seriously, and in this 
he was right. I later found among 
his papers a printed lecture pro- 
gram with a date from the year 
1891; Ganswindt said that this 
was one of his later lectures, which 
could easily be correct. 

HATEVER ill feelings he 
might have hqrbored against 
me originally, for not mentioning 
him in my first book, evaporated 
quickly and thoroughly when I 
explained that, while I knew his 
name (which was true), I had 
never heard that he had tried to 
invent a spaceship. I later realized 
that I had read about that at one 
time in a kind of boy’s annual that 
used to be (and now is again) 
published in Germany every year 
at about Christmas. Ganswindt in- 
vited me to his home. The pic- 
ture hanging over the upright 




FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



39 




Hermann Ganswindt's spaceship 



piano (reproduced here) was that 
of his spaceship. I examined it 
carefully, hoping to find a date. 
There was none, but the aging of 
the picture and its style both 
dated it as about 1890. 

The idea was this: the passen- 
ger cabin was supported (on 
springs) from the bell-shaped com- 
bustion chamber. The fuel sup- 
ply was stored in two drums to 
the right and left of the combus- 
tion chamber. The fuel was to con- 
sist of steel capsules; at any rate, 
this term comes closest to what 
Ganswindt had in mind. He ex- 
plained it to me in more detail. 



but of course I can’t vouch that he 
had explained it the same way in 
1890. 

Imagine a sandwich made of 
two silver dollars with a thin slice 
of dynamite between them. For 
“silver dollars” read “steel disks” 
of considerable thickness, but 
about the size of a dollar piece. 
(Ganswindt did not say “silver 
dollars” — he said five-mark pieces, 
but the Imperial German five- 
mark piece and the silver dollar 
are very nearly the same size and 
weight. ) These metal-plus-high- 
explosive sandwiches were to be 
fed into the chamber one by one.

to be exploded there. The lower 
disk would drop through a well 
in the passenger cabin immediate- 
ly; the upper disk would hit the 
inside of the bell-shaped chamber 
and transmit its energy to it be- 
fore dropping out. 

When the ship was under way, 
the combustion feeding would be 
stopped. Then the passenger cabin 
would begin rotating around its 
center well, so that the two flat 
ends would become the two floors. 
Ganswindt knew that weightless- 
ness would take place as soon as 
the acceleration stopped, and he 
had figured out that centrifugal 
force could replace gravity. 

That is as far as Ganswindt 
went. He had other plans and 
other worries too. But he was 
right to insist on being mentioned 
in the books as a forerunner. He 
was one. 

After spending several evenings 
with Ganswindt, I did write up 
his life story. It was to be one of 
those full-page newspaper features 
which are customary in Europe. I 
took it to a newspaper editor who 
often printed my pieces. He called 
me up a few days later and said 
that he had read it and liked it, 
but that he was not going to print 
it. There was no reason to print 
it at the time. Then he continued 
by saying: “Look, I have nothing 
against the old gentleman and I 
wish him well. But he is old, and 
if you want me to. I’ll keep the 

FOR YOUR I NFORMATION 



piece and pay you now and pub- 
lish it as an obituary.” 

Well, no, this is not how it 
happened, even though I said yes 
with some hesitation. Hermann 
Ganswindt did die about three 
years after this conversation (on 
October 25, 1934), but my full- 
page feature article about him was 
not published. 

In the meantime. Hitler had 
come to power and all non-Nazi 
papers had been banned. I don’t 
know if the unpublished manu- 
scripts were simply destroyed or 
whether they were neatly filed 
somewhere to be used as evidence 
if and when necessary. I still have 
the carbon copy. 

THE VELOCITY OF A 
SATELLITE IN ORBIT 

T THINK I am fully justified 
in assuming that many of my 
readers have saved a few news- 
paper clippings about the artificial 
satellites, especially the tabula- 
tions giving their weights and 
dimensions. In case you did, get 
one of these tabulations out and 
check the column which gives 
their velocity in orbit. You’ll see 
that each and every one of them 
bears the label 18,000 miles per 
hour. 

There are three statements one 
can make about that figure. State- 
ment number one is that it is 
wrong. Statement number two is 

41 



that it is impossible. And state- 
ment number three is that this 
figure has, by now, achieved the 
status of an unliterary convention, 
like the saying about the fifty mil- 
lion Frenchmen who cannot be 
wrong, which is wrong on three 
counts too. In the first place, there 
are only 43 million Frenchmen in 
France; in the second, they rare- 
ly agree on anything; thirdly, 
mere numbers are not proof of 
correctness. 

Of course everybody hearing 
that this famous figure of 18,000 
miles per hour is wrong has a per- 
fect right — in fact almost an 
obligation — to ask about the cor- 
rect figure. And that is where the 
trouble starts. There is not one 
correct figure. There are hundreds, 
even thousands, of them. It all de- 
pends on the case. To begin some- 
where, let us see where this figure 
of 18,000 miles per hour comes 
from. Does it hold true in any spe- 
cific case? 

The answer is no, and the most 
one can say for this figure is that 
it is the result of multiplying 3600 
by 5. The reason for these two 
figures is that 3600 is the num- 
ber of seconds in one hour while 
the “5” is supposed to be the 
velocity of the satellite in miles 
per second. 

Now everybody knows, or at 
least should know, that an artifi- 
cial satellite has to move the faster 
the nearer it is to the ground. 



The highest velocity, then, would 
be required of a satellite which 
races around the Earth at sea 
level. Let us assume that no con- 
tinents, mountains or buildings are 
in the way and that air resistance 
has been removed by magic. How 
fast would it have to move then?" 
The answer is 7914 meters per 
second, which is precisely 4.973,- 
445 miles per second or 17,904.4 
miles per hour. 

Since you cannot have a sea- 
level satellite in reality, every 
satellite which is actually possible 
would have to move more slowly 
than that, or else it would not 
stay in orbit. 

The next question is obviously 
how low a real satellite can be 
placed and how fast it would be 
in that fastest possible orbit. 

I was confronted with that ques- 
tion a fair number of years ago 
for a rather unlikely reason. The 
year in question happened to be 
the seventy-fifth anniversary of 
the publication of Jules Verne’s 
Around the World in Eighty Days 
and a magazine editor wanted an 
article about this. 

There were a number of things 
to be investigated for the purpose 
of this article. How fast could you 
get around the Earth nowadays, 
using any means of transportation 
except flying? How fast could you 
get around the Earth using com- 
mercial airliners only, no special 
flights, please? How fast could you 



42 



GALAXY 



do it with special flights? The idea 
was: could it be done in eight 
days, instead of eighty days? (The 
answer was yes, using commer- 
cial airliners only.) Could it be 
done in eighty hours? (Not when 
the article was written, but it 
might be possible now.) 

' I ^HEN the question came up: 
could a rocket do it in eighty 
minutes? Strangely enough, it did 
not occur to me at the time just 
to calculate the sea-level satel- 
lite first, in which case I would 
have found out quickly that even 
at sea level it takes more than 
eighty minutes. I calculated two 
other orbits first, coming closer 
and closer, and did not hit on the 
sea-level orbit until I had con- 
vinced myself that an orbit 20 
miles up would need just about 85 
minutes. The satellite at sea level 
would take about two minutes less. 

Although the question of 
whether it could be done in eighty 
minutes was not asked for scien- 
tific reasons, it is nevertheless true 
that scientific calculations also 
start out with the question of the 
orbital period. There is a very 
good practical reason for this. If 
you establish a satellite in a per- 
manent orbit, an orbit that does 
not touch the atmosphere at any 
point, you want to check on it. 
This checking can be most easily 
accomplished if the satellite passes 
over a given point at a given time. 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



This, in turn, means that the or- 
bital period of the satellite must 
be a definite fraction of the 24 
hours which the Earth needs to 
turn on its axis. In other words, 
you want a satellite which will 
make a certain number of com- 
plete revolutions around the Earth 
in 24 hours. 

The research satellites which 
we now have don’t do that, and 
it might be worth emphasizing that 
there is no need for this. For re- 
search purposes, any orbit will do; 
you want to learn something and 
you can learn something from any 
orbit, provided it is observed care- 
fully. 

But for a satellite which has a 
purpose other than research — say 
one for navigational purposes — 
you want a nearly circular orbit 
with a period which results in com- 
plete revolutions. It does not matter 
much whether that satellite makes 
16 or 12 or 10 or only 6 revolu- 
tions per day. It does matter that 
they are complete revolutions, with 
no fractions left over. 

It is for this reason that the 
question about the orbital period 
comes first. A period of 1 hour 
39 minutes and 23.4 seconds 
would be awkward to handle. But 
an orbital period of 90 minutes 
would give you 16 complete revo- 
lutions, a period of 120 minutes 
would give you 12 complete revo- 
lutions, a period of 2 hours and 
24 minutes would produce 10 

43 



complete revolutions, a 3-hour 
period 8 revolutions, a 4-hour 
period 6 revolutions, and so forth. 

The first of the ones just men- 
tioned would have to be at an al- 
titude of 174 miles. That would 
produce an orbital period of 90 
minutes, and 16 complete revolu- 
tions, with an orbital velocity of 
4.815 miles per second. Only one 
year ago, the question of whether 
174 miles is high enough to avoid 
even residual air resistance would 
have been answered in the affirma- 
tive without any hesitation. Now, 
after the first half-dozen artificial 
satellites have been in various or- 
bits, this answer would be a little 
less positive. It is still likely that 
a 90-minute orbit would be stable, 
but nobody would be too surprised 
if somebody were to prove that it 
is not. 

T^EXT one farther out, Wern- 
’ her von Braun’s two-hour or- 
bit, is still considered safe. There 
you would have 1050 miles be- 
tween you and the ground (the 
slight disagreement in such figures 
that you can find are ultimately 
based on the diameter assigned to 
the Earth, and they are of little 
practical importance) and an or- 
bital velocity of 4.374 miles per 
second. To make ten complete 
revolutions around the Earth, you 
would have to be just a mile or 
so less than 1700 miles from the 
ground, which would produce an 



orbital period of 2 hours 24 min- 
utes with an orbital velocity of 
4.113 miles per second. For the 
three-hour orbit, you would have 
to be 2600 miles from the ground 
and would have to move at the 
rate of 3.821 miles per second to 
stay in that orbit. Finally, for the 
four-hour orbit, the distance would 
have to be very nearly 4000 miles 
away (the precise figure, as now 
calculated, is 3993 miles) and the 
orbital velocity would be 3.473 
miles per second. 

You can see how far we have 
removed ourselves from those 
standard 18,000 miles per hour 
or 5 miles per second. 

Since we are going more and 
more slowly, one might ask just 
how slow a satellite might go and 
still be a satellite. At a distance 
of 46,000 miles from the Earth’s 
surface, the orbital velocity would 
be down to 1.39 miles per second 
and the satellite would need 2 
days and almost 15 hours for one 
complete revolution. At twice the 
distance, the orbital velocity would 
be down to 0.89 miles per second 
(or 4700 feet per second) while 
the orbital period would be up to 
8 days and nearly 5 hours. Again 
doubling the distance reduces the 
orbital velocity to 0.69 miles per 
second (3650 feet per second) 
and increases the orbital period 
to 21 days. 

Of course we can’t go on dou- 
bling the distance as we have been 



44 



GALAXY 



doing, for there must come a point 
where the Earth’s gravitational 
field i^ no longer powerful enough 
to hold the satellite. That maxi- 
mum distance, according to Dr. 
Robert S. Richardson, is 923,000 
miles from the Earth’s surface, re- 
sulting in an orbital period of 210 
days. The orbital velocity would 
be 1700 feet per second. 

Beyond this distance, you can’t 
have a satellite of Earth. If you 
tried to put one farther out, say 
at a distance of 1,500,000 miles, 
it would not stay a satellite of 
Earth. It would be snatched by 
the Sun and orbit as a very minor 
planet. 

WHY AN ELLIPTICAL 
ORBIT ? 

T he question I get most fre- 
quently is the one asked in 
the sub-head. No matter how often 
I explain it, in writing, in person 
or on television, I can be sure that 
on the very next day somebody 
will write or telephone or button- 
hole me and ask: “The one thing 
I can’t understand is why those 
orbits are ellipses.” 

I never give the answer I really 
want to give. What I want to say 
is “Because they are.” Or else “Be- 
cause Kepler said so.” Instead of 
speaking my mind, I sigh (some- 
times audibly) and reach for a 
pencil or a piece of chalk and say: 
“This circle is meant to represent 



the Earth. This dotted line around 
it is meant to represent the orbit 
of a satellite. Never mind how 
sloppily it is drawn, it is supposed 
to be a mathematical circle. Now, 
in a circular orbit, the velocity is 
the same for every point of the 
orbit. If that satellite were at a 
distance of 560 miles, the velocity 
has to be 4.6 miles per second. 
If it is less, the satellite will ap- 
proach the Earth; if it is more, 
the satellite will recede from the 
Earth. 

“If it recedes, it will climb 
against the Earth’s gravitational 
pull. That will reduce its velocity. 
So it will come to a point where 
its actual velocity is less than it 
would have to have to go into an 
orbit at that distance. This means 
that gravity will win and it will 
approach the Earth again. But in 
approaching the Earth, the satel- 
lite gains velocity. So it will grow 
to be too fast to go into an orbit 
at the distance at which it now 
finds itself. Hence it will recede 
again and this will go on and on 
until an external force, such as 
air resistance, intervenes and 
changes the picture.” 

In repeating this standard ex- 
planation, I have omitted the 
blank looks which interrupt it at 
random points, and I have also 
omitted the repetitions I put in 
because of these blank looks. Af- 
ter all, the advantage of the 
printed word is that every reader 



FOR YOUR I NFORMATION 



45 



can go over a printed sentence as 
often as he wants. 

The point where I sometimes 
was tripped came when the per- 
son said brightly: “Yes, now I 
see why this would come out as 
an ellipse and why the satellite 
would be slowest when it is 
farthest from the Earth and fastest 
when it is nearest to the Earth. 
Can you tell me a few figures?” 
No, I couldn’t. I knew a number 
of figures applying to circular or- 
bits, but every elliptical orbit is 
different and would have to be 
calculated separately. Which is 
something one can’t do standing 
on a lecture platform or sitting in 
front of a television camera. 

However, now I can give figures 
for at least some cases. Professor 
Dr. Karl Schiitte of the German 
Society for Rocket and Space Re- 
search has published a table in 
his recent book Die Weltraum- 
fahrt hat begonnen (“Space Travel 
Has Begun”) which will be most 
helpful for such occasions. 

T>UT before you look at the 
table, read these explanations. 
The assumption is that you have 
an artificial satellite in an orbit 
around the Earth, a circular orbit 
which is as far down as air resist- 
ance will permit. Its velocity in 
orbit will be less than 4.9 miles 
per second; how much less would 
depend on the altitude. Now it is 
assumed that the velocity of this 



satellite is increased by rocket 
power, producing a new and higher 
velocity which is given in the first 
column. 

This new velocity sends the 
satellite into an elliptical orbit. In 
the elliptical orbit, this new veloci- 
ty becomes the perigee velocity 
which the satellite will have every 
time it goes through its perigee 
near the original circular orbit. 
The second column then shows 
where the apogee of the new orbit 
will be, meaning how far it will 
go away in its new orbit. The 
third column gives the velocity 
in miles per second at the apogee, 
where the satellite is slowest. The 
last column, finally, gives the or- 
bital period. 

The last line on Table I repre- 
sents a case where just about 1.6 
miles per second have been added 
to the orbital velocity which the 
satellite had to begin with, and 
this addition of just about one- 
third of the orbital velocity pro- 
duces an ellipse that' will go near- 
ly 40,000 miles out. One other 
thing which is worth pointing out 
is the increasing discrepancy be- 
tween perigee and apogee veloci- 
ties (first and third columns) as 
the ellipse lengthens. 

But what is really amazing is 
what follows after the velocity has 
gone to the level of 6.6 miles at 
perigee. (See Table II.) If you 
look at the first column of figures 
carefully, you’ll also note that the

velocity increases from case to 
case are less than they were before. 

The last line, you may have 
noticed, is one where just two 
miles per second have been added 
to the original orbital velocity, 
but the result of this addition is an 
apogee far beyond the distance 
of the Moon. 

The low apogee velocities for 
the longest orbits are also amaz- 
ing. This may show more strong- 
ly if they are expressed in feet 
per second. At the apogee of the 
orbit that extends to 174,744 
miles, the velocity is a mere 800 
feet per second; at the apogee of 
the orbit that goes to 234,000 
miles, the velocity is 580 feet 
per second; and at the apogee of 
the last example in the table, it 
is 343 feet per second, less than 
the cruising speed of an airliner. 

One of the reasons I have 
quoted Professor Schiitte’s table is 
that some of these orbits will be 
used in the near future. There 
are various reasons why it would 
be practical (though not theoreti- 
cally superior) to put a so-called 
probe into an orbit first, an ordi- 
nary satellite orbit near the Earth, 
before radioing the firing com- 
mand to the top stage of the rocket 
assembly. Likewise, at a later date, 
the first manned trips into deeper 
space are also likely to follow 
such orbits because they, too, are 
going to start with normal orbit- 
ing. 



And, finally, an 3 rthing that will 
be sent out from a space station 
would follow such an orbit be- 
cause the space station will be 
in a circular orbit, so that every 
probe from the station will just 
add to the orbital velocity it has. 

HOW SECRET WAS 
SPUTNIK NO. 1 ? 

T HAVE just returned from Port- 
land, Oregon, where, among 
a few dozen other things, I also 
spent an evening with the local 
moonwatch team. They told me 
something that I had not known 
before. Around the middle of Sep- 
tember, 1957, radio hams in the 
Portland area learned from their 
opposite numbers in Japan that 
the Soviet government had in- 
formed the Japanese radio hams 
and moonwatchers that their first 
satellite would broadcast on such 
and such a wave length so that 
they could check their receiving 
equipment and tune in properly. 

While the younger and more ac- 
tive citizens could tell me stories 
like this, their elders still expressed 
astonishment about the surprising 
appearance of Sputnik No. 1. 
Knowing that the word “surprise” 
can have several shades of mean- 
ing, I was careful to find out just 
what they meant. Did they mean 
they were surprised that an arti- 
ficial satellite was possible at all? 
Well, yes, that too, but they meant 



48 



GALAXY 



they were surprised because no- 
body had ever said anything about 
a forthcoming Russian artificial 
satellite. 

All I could say at the moment 
was that I had known about a 
Russian satellite program for quite 
some time. It had been mentioned 
as a part of the IGY for nearly as 
long as the American Vanguard 
program. 

A FTER my return to New York, 
I decided to check on the ob- 
scurity of the Russian satellite pro- 
gram and I restricted my checking 
to such sources that anybody could 
and most likely would see. In 
other words, I ruled out foreign 
publications and all printed mat- 
ter that could not be bought at a 
newsstand, as for example news- 
letters and circulars of professional 
societies of one type or another. 
To be even more rigid, I also ruled 
out any publication, of whatever 
type, which had appeared prior 
to the announcement of the Van- 
guard Project. The reason for this 
was that I expected eyes to have 
been sharpened for satellite news 
after the Vanguard announcement, 
no matter how dull said eyes may 
have been before. 

Here is what I found: 

Exhibit A. The October 31, 1955, 
issue of Aviation Week contained 
a report which was nearly one 
full page, dealing with an article 
by Professor Kyrill Stanyukovitch, 



reporting on Project Vanguard to 
the Russians, ending with the 
words “Russian engineers believe 
that it is possible to build larger 
satellites than those being dis- 
cussed now in the Western Press.” 
Exhibit B. The October 29, 1956, 
issue of the same magazine with 
a report on an article in the Mos- 
cow News by Professor Georgi 
Pokrovsky which stated that the 
Russian satellite would have a 
diameter of 24 inches, a weight of 
about 100 pounds, and that the 
perigee of its orbit would be at 
185 miles and the apogee at 810 
miles. (Actual figures for Sput- 
nik No. 1: diameter 23.8 inches, 
weight 184 pounds, orbit 156 to 
560 miles.) 

Exhibit C. The New York Times, 
issue of June 2, 1957. Contained 
report on an article in Pravda by 
Professor Alexander Nesmen- 
yanov, president of the Soviet 
Academy of Sciences, stating “We 
have created the rockets and all 
the equipment and instruments 
necessary to solve the problem of 
the artificial earth satellite.” 
Exhibit D. The June 9, 1957, is- 
sue of the same newspaper, con- 
taining an article about an article 
in the Literaturnaya Gazyeta 
which told about the Russian 
“space dogs,” trained from puppy- 
hood for rocket and satellite flight. 
Exhibit E. The New York Times, 
issue of June 20, 1957, containing 
an interview with several Russian 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



49 



scientists, all predicting “several” 
Soviet satellites for the IGY. 
Exhibit F. The July 29, 1957, is- 
sue of Aviation Week with an ac- 
count of a three-day symposium 
of the Royal Aeronautical Society 
where Milton Rosen reported on 
the Vanguard Program and Pro- 
fessor Boris Petrov stated that the 
Russian Earth satellites would be 
launched at a considerable angle 
to the equator, as close to a merid- 
ian (pole to pole) shot as possible. 
Professor Petrov’s speech was news 
only because it was in the form of 
a lecture; he repeated what had 
been said in an official Russian 
document handed to IGY head- 
quarters in Uccle (Belgium) in 
June. Excerpts from this docu- 
ment had been carried by the 
major newspaper of all the 64 
nations participating in the IGY. 
Exhibit G. Reuter’s Wire Service, 
August 3, 1957, distributed world- 
wide a dispatch stating that Pro- 
fessor Evgenii Fyedorov had been 



officially named head of the Rus- 
sian satellite program. Professor 
Fyedorov was quoted as saying 
that the satellites would be shot 
at dawn (which was done), that 
a three-stage rocket would be used 
(which was done), and that they 
wanted a 90-minute orbit (turned 
out to be 93 minutes). 

A week or so prior to this dis- 
patch, a Russian radio magazine 
carried full information about the 
transmitters and wave lengths to 
be used. 

I ho doubt missed a few items, 
but this should have been enough 
information for anybody. If some- 
body tells me that he has the 
rockets to shoot — which we knew 
from other sources, anyway — and 
tells me what he will shoot, how 
he will shoot it, and in general 
says virtually everything except 
for the precise date — well, what 
should I feel like if I’m surprised 
vhen the man shoots?

Birds of a 



Getting specimens for the interstellar zoo 
was no problem — they battled for the honor 
— but now I had to fight like a wildcat to 
keep a display from making a monkey of me!

Feather

Illustrated by WOOD 




BIRDS OF A FEATHER 



I T was our first day of recruit- 
ing on the planet, and the 
alien life-forms had lined up 
for hundreds of feet back from my 
rented office. As I came down the 
block from the hotel, I could hear 
and see and smell them with ease. 

My three staff men, Auchinleck, 
Stebbins and Ludlow, walked 
shieldwise in front of me. I peered 
between them to size the crop up. 
The aliens came in every shape 
and form, in all colors and tex- 
tures — and all of them eager for 
a Corrigan contract. The Galaxy 
is full of bizarre beings, but there’s 
barely a species anywhere that 
can resist the old exhibitionist 
urge. 

“Send them in one at a time,” 
I told Stebbins. I ducked into 
the office, took my place back of 
the desk and waited for the pro- 
cession to begin. 

The name of the planet was 
MacTavish IV (if you went by 
the official Terran listing) or 
Ghryne (if you called it by what 
its people were accustomed to 
calling it). I thought of it privately 
as MacTavish IV and referred to 
it publicly as Ghryne. I believe in 
keeping the locals happy wherever 
I go. 

Through the front window of 
the office, I could see our big gay 
tridim sign plastered to a facing 
wall: WANTED — extraterres- 

trials! We had saturated Mac- 
Tavish IV with our promotional 

53 



poop for a month preceding ar- 
rival. Stuff like this: 

Want to visit Earth — see the 
Galaxy’s most glittering and ex- 
clusive world? Want to draw 
good pay, work short hours, ex- 
perience the thrills of show busi- 
ness on romantic Terra? If you 
are a non-terrestrial, there may 
be a place for you in the Cor- 
rigan Institute of Morphologi- 
cal Science. No freaks wanted 
— normal beings only. J. F. 
Corrigan will hold interviews in 
person on Ghryne from Third- 
day to Fifthday of Tenmonth. 
His last visit to the Caledonia 
Cluster until 2937, so don’t miss 
your chance! Hurry! A life of 
wonder and riches can be yours! 

T> ROADSIDES like that, dis- 
tributed wholesale in half a 
thousand languages, always bring 
them running. And the Corrigan 
Institute really packs in the crowds 
back on Earth. Why not? It’s the 
best of its kind, the only really 
decent place where Earthmen can 
get a gander at the other species 
of the universe. 

The office buzzer sounded. 
Auchinleck said unctuously, “The 
first applicant is ready to see you, 
sir.” 

“Send him, her or it in.” 

The door opened and a timid- 
looking life-form advanced toward 
me on nervous little legs. He was 



a globular creature about the size 
of a big basketball, yellowish- 
green, with two spindly double- 
kneed legs and five double-el- 
bowed arms, the latter spaced 
regularly around his body. There 
was a lidless eye at the top of his 
head and five lidded ones, one 
above each arm. Plus a big, gap- 
ing, toothless mouth. 

His voice was a surprisingly re- 
sounding basso. “You are Mr. 
Corrigan?” 

“That’s right.” I reached for a 
data blank. “Before we begin. I’ll 
need certain information about—” 
“I am a being of Regulus II,” 
came the grave, booming reply, 
even before I had picked up the 
blank. “I need no special care and 
I am not a fugitive from the law 
of any world.” 

“Your name?” 

“Lawrence R. Fitzgerald.” 

I throttled my exclamation of 
surprise, concealing it behind a 
quick cough. “Let me have that 
again, please?” 

“Certainly. My name is Law- 
rence R. Fitzgerald. The ‘R’ stands 
for Raymond.” 

“Of course, that’s not the name 
you were born with.” 

The being closed his eyes and 
toddled around in a 360-degree 
rotation, remaining in place. On 
his world, that gesture is the equiv- 
alent of an apologetic smile. “My 
Regulan name no longer matters. 
I am now and shall evermore be 



54 



GALAXY 



Lawrence R. Fitzgerald. I am a 
Terraphile, you see.” 

npHE little Regulan was as good 
as hired. Only the formalities 
remained. “You understand our 
terms, Mr. Fitzgerald?” 

“I’ll be placed on exhibition at 
your Institute on Earth. You’ll pay 
for my services, transportation and 
expenses. I’ll be required to re- 
main on exhibit no more than one- 
third of each Terran sidereal day.” 
“And the pay will be — ah — 
$50 Galactic a week, plus ex- 
penses and transportation.” 

The spherical creature clapped 
his hands in joy, three hands clap- 
ping on one side, two on the other. 
“Wonderful! I will see Earth at 
last! I accept the terms!” 

I buzzed for Ludlow and gave 
him the fast signal that meant we 
were signing this alien up at half 
the usual pay, and Ludlow took 
him into the other office to sign 
him up. 

I grinned, pleased with myself. 
We needed a green Regulan in 
our show; the last one had quit 
four years ago. But just because 
we needed him didn’t mean we 
had to be extravagant in hiring 
him. A Terraphile alien who goes 
to the extent of rechristening him- 
self with a Terran monicker would 
work for nothing, or even pay us, 
just so long as we let him get to 
Earth. My conscience won’t let me 
really exploit a being, but I don’t 

BIRDS OF A FEATHER 



believe in throwing money away, 
either. 

The next applicant was a beefy 
ursinoid from Aldebaran IX. Our 
outfit has all the ursinoids it needs 
or is likely to need in the next 
few decades, and so I got rid of 
him in a couple of minutes. He 
was followed by a roly-poly blue- 
skinned humanoid from Dono- 
van’s’ Planet, four feet high and 
five hundred pounds heavy. We 
already had a couple of his species 
in the show, but they made good 
crowd-pleasers, being so plump 
and cheerful. I passed him along 
to Auchinleck to sign at anything 
short of top rate. 

Next came a bedraggled Sirian 
spider who was more interested in 
a handout than a job. If there’s 
any species we have a real over- 
supply of, it’s those silver-colored 
spiders, but this seedy specimen 
gave it a try anyway. He got the 
gate in half a minute, and he didn’t 
even get the handout he was an- 
gling for. I don’t approve of beg- 
ging. 

The flora of applicants was 
steady. Ghryne is in the heart of 
the Caledonia Cluster, where the 
interstellar crossroads meet. We 
had figured to pick up plenty of 
new exhibits here and we were 
right. 

I'T was the isolationism of the 

late 29th century that turned 
me into the successful proprietor of 



55 



Corrigan’s Institute, after some 
years as an impoverished carnival 
man in the Betelgeuse system. 
Back in 2903, the World Congress 
declared Terra off-bounds for non- 
terrestrial beings, as an offshoot of 
the Terra for Terrans movement. 

Before then, anyone could visit 
Earth. After the gate clanged 
down, a non-terrestrial could only 
get onto Sol III as a specimen in 
a scientific collection — in short, 
as an exhibit in a zoo. 

- That’s what the Corrigan Insti- 
tute of Morphological Science 
really is, of course. A zoo. But we 
don’t go out and hunt for our 
specimens; we advertise and they 
come flocking to us. Every alien 
wants to see Earth once in his 
lifetime, and there’s only one way 
he can do it. 

We don’t keep too big an inven- 
tory. At last count, we had 690 
specimens before this trip, repre- 
senting 298 different intelligent 
life-forms. My goal is at least one 
member of at least 500 different 
races. When I reach that. I’ll sit 
back and let the competition catch 
up — if it can. 

After an hour of steady work 
that morning, we had signed eleven 
new specimens. At the same time, 
we had turned away a dozen ur- 
sinoids, fifty of the reptilian na- 
tives of Ghryne, seven Sirian 
spiders, and no less than nineteen 
chlorine-breathing Procyonites 
wearing gas masks. 



It was also my sad duty to nix 
a Vegan who was negotiating 
through a Ghrynian agent. A 
Vegan would be a top-flight at- 
traction, being some 400 feet long 
and appropriately fearsome to the 
eye, but I didn’t see how we could 
take one on. They’re gentle and 
likable beings, but their upkeep 
runs into literally tons of fresh 
meat a day, and not just any old 
kind of meat either. So we had to 
do without the Vegan. 

“One more specimen before 
lunch,” I told Stebbins, “to make 
it an even dozen.” 

He looked at me queerly and 
nodded. A being entered. I took a 
long close look at the life-form 
when it came in, and after that I 
took another one. I wondered what 
kind of stunt was being pulled. So 
far as I could tell, the being was 
quite plainly nothing but an 
Earthman. 

He sat down facing me without 
being asked and crossed his legs. 
He was tall and extremely thin, 
with pale blue eyes and dirty- 
blond hair, and though he was 
clean and reasonably well dressed, 
he had a shabby look about him. 
He said, in level Terran accents, 
“I’m looking for a job with your 
outfit, Corrigan.” 

“There’s been a mistake. We’re 
interested in non-terrestrials only.” 
“I’m a non-terrestrial. My name 
is Ildwar Gorb, of the planet Waz- 
zenazz XIII.” 



56 



GALAXY 



1 DON’T mind conning the pub- 
lic from time to time, but I 
draw the line at getting bilked 
myself. “Look, friend, I’m busy, 
and I’m not known for my sense of 
humor. Or my generosity,” 

“I’m not panhandling. I’m look- 
ing for a job.” 

“Then try elsewhere. Suppose 
you stop wasting my time, bud. 
You’re as Earthborn as I am.” 
“I’ve never been within a dozen 
parsecs of Earth,” he said smooth- 
ly. “I happen to be a representa- 
tive of the only Earthlike race that 
exists anywhere in the Galaxy but 
on Earth itself. Wazzenazz XIII is 
a small and little-known planet in 
the Crab Nebula. Through an evo- 
lutionary fluke, my race is iden- 
tical with yours. Now, don’t you 
want me in your circus?” 

“No. And it’s not a circus. If s — ” 
“A scientific institute. I stand 
corrected.” 

There was something glib and 
appealing about this preposterous 
phony. I guess I recognized a kin- 
dred spirit or I would have tossed 
him out on his ear without another 
word. Instead I played along. “If 
you’re from such a distant place, 
how come you speak English so 
well?” 

“I’m not speaking. I’m a tele- 
path — not the kind that reads 
minds, just the kind that projects. 
I communicate in symbols that 
you translate back to colloquial 
speech.” 

BIRDS OF A FEATHER 



“Very clever, Mr. Gorb.” I 
grinned at him and shook my head. 
“You spin a good yarn — but for 
my money, you’re really Sam 
Jones or Phil Smith ffom Earth, 
stranded here and out of cash. You 
want a free trip back to Earth. No 
deal. The demand for beings from 
Wazzenazz XIII is pretty low 
these days. Zero, in. fact. Good-by, 
Mr. Gorb.” 

He pointed a finger squarely at 
me and said, “You’re making a 
big mistake. I’m just what your 
outfit needs. A representative of 
a hitherto utterly unknown race 
identical to humanity in every re- 
spect! Look here, examine my 
teeth. Absolutely like human 
teeth! And — ” 

I pulled away from his yawning 
mouth. “Good-by, Mr. Gorb,” I 
repeated. 

“All I ask is a contract, Corrigan. 
It isn’t much. I’ll be a big attrac- 
tion. I’ll - ” 

“Good-by, Mr. Gorb!” 

He glowered at me reproach- 
fully for a moment, stood up and 
sauntered to the door. “I thought 
you were a man of acumen, Cor- 
rigan. Well, think it over. Maybe 
you’ll regret your hastiness. I’ll be 
back to give you another chance.” 

He slammed the door and I let 
my grim expression relax into a 
smile. This was the best con switch 
yet — an Earthman posing as an 
alien to get a job! 

But I wasn’t buying it, even if 

57 



I could appreciate his cleverness 
intellectually. There’s no such 
place as Wazzenazz XIII and 
there’s only one human race in 
the Galaxy — on Earth. I was 
going to need some real good rea- 
son before I gave a down-and-out 
grifter a free ticket home. 

I didn’t know it then, but before 
the day was out, I would have that 
reason. And, with it, plenty of trou- 
ble on my hands. 

^ I ’HE first harbinger of woe 
turned up after lunch in the 
person of a Kallerian. The Kalleri- 
an was the sixth applicant that 
afternoon. I had turned away three 
more ursinoids, hired a vegetable 
from Miazan, and said no to a 
scaly pseudo-armadillo from one 
of the Delta Worlds. Hardly had 
the ’dillo scuttled dejectedly out 
of my office ■ when the Kallerian 
came striding in, not even waiting 
for Stebbins to admit him officially. 

He was big even for his kind — 
in the neighborhood of nine feet 
high, and getting on toward a ton. 
He planted himself firmly on his 
three stocky feet, extended his 
massive arms in a Kallerian greet- 
ing-gesture, and growled, “I am 
Vallo Heraal, Freeman of Kaller 
IV. You will sign me immediately 
to a contract.” 

“Sit down. Freeman Heraal. I 
like to make my own decisions, 
thanks.” 

“You will grant me a contract!” 



“Will you please sit down?” 

He said sulkily, “I will remain 
standing.” 

“As you prefer.” My desk has a 
few concealed features which are 
sometimes useful in dealing with 
belligerent or disappointed life- 
forms. My fingers roamed to the 
meshgun trigger, just in case of 
trouble. 

The Kallerian stood motionless 
before me. They’re hairy creatures, 
and this one had a coarse, thick 
mat of blue fur completely cover- 
ing his body. Two fierce eyes glim- 
mered out through the otherwise 
dense blanket of fur. He was wear- 
ing the kilt, girdle and ceremonial 
blaster of his warlike race. 

I said, “You’ll have to under- 
stand, Freeman Heraal, that it’s 
not our policy to maintain more 
than a few members of each spe- 
cies at our Institute. And we’re not 
currently in need of any Kallerian 
males, because — ” 

“You will hire me or trouble I 
will make!” 

I opened our inventory chart. 
I showed him that we were already 
carrying four Kallerians, and that 
was more than plenty. 

The beady little eyes flashed 
like beacons in hte fur. “Yes, you 
have four representatives — of the 
Clan Verdrokh! None of the Clan 
Gursdrinn! For three years, I have 
waited for a chance to avenge this 
insult to the noble Clan Gurs- 
drinn!” 



58 



GALAXY 



At the key-word avenge, I 
readied myself to ensnarl the Kal- 
lerian in a spume of tanglemesh 
the instant he went for his blaster, 
but he didn’t move. He bellowed, 
“I have vowed a vow, Earthman. 
Take me to Earth, enroll a Gurs- 
drinn, or the consequences will be 
terrible!” 

T’M a man of principles, like all 
straightforward double-dealers, 
and one of the most important of 
those principles is that I never let 
myself be bullied by anyone. “I 
deeply regret having unintention- 
ally insulted your clan. Freeman 
Heraal. Will you accept my apolo- 
gies?” 

He glared at me in silence. 

I went on, “Please be assured 
that I’ll undo the insult at the 
earliest possible opportunity. It’s 
not feasible for us to hire another 
Kallerian now, but I’ll give prefer- 
ence to the Clan Gursdrinn as soon 
as a vacancy — ” 

“No. You will hire me now.” 

“It can’t be done. Freeman 
Heraal. We have a budget, and we 
stick to it.” 

“You will rue! I will take drastic 
measures!” 

“Threats will get you nowhere, 
Freeman Heraal. I give you my 
word I’ll get in touch with you as 
soon as our organization has room 
for another Kallerian. And now, 
please, there are many applicants 
waiting — ” 



You’d think it would be sort of 
humiliating to become a specimen 
in a zoo, but most of these races 
take it as an honor. And there’s 
always the chance that, by picking 
a given member of a race, we’re 
insulting all the others. 

I nudged the trouble-button on 
the side of my desk and Auchin- 
leck and Ludlow appeared simul- 
taneously from the two doors at 
right and left. They surrounded 
the towering Kallerian and sweet- 
talkingly led him away. He wasn’t 
minded to quarrel physically, or 
he could have knocked them both 
into the next city with a backhand 
swipe of his shaggy paw, but he 
kept up a growling flow of invec- 
tive and threats until he was out 
in the hall. 

I mopped sweat from my fore- 
head and began to buzz Stebbins 
for the next applicant. But before 
my finger touched the button, the 
door popped open and a small 
being came scooting in, followed 
by an angry Stebbins. 

“Come here, you!” 

“Stebbins?” I said gently. 

“I’m sorry, Mr. Corrigan. I lost 
sight of this one for a moment, 
and he came running in — ” 
“Please, please,” squeaked the 
little alien pitifully. “I must see 
you, honored sir!” 

“It isn’t his turn in line,” Steb- 
bins protested. “There are at least 
fifty ahead of him.” 

“All right,” I said tiredly. “As 



BIRDS OF A FEATHER 



59 



long as he’s in here already, I 
might as well see him. Be more 
careful next time, Stebbins.” 
Stebbins nodded dolefully and 
backed out. 

^''HE alien was a pathetic sight: 
a Stortulian, a squirrely-look- 
ing creature about three feet high. 
His fur, which should have been a 
lustrous black, was a dull gray, 
and his eyes were wet and sad. 
His tail drooped. His voice was lit- 
tle more than a faint whimper, 
even at full volume. 

“Begging your most honored 
pardon most humbly, important 
sir. I am a being of Stortul XII, 
having sold my last few posses- 
sions to travel to Ghryne for the 
miserable purpose of obtaining an 
interview with yourself.” 

I said, “I’d better tell you right 
at the outset that we’re already 
carrying our full complement of 
Stortulians. We have both a male 
and a female now and — ” 

“This is known to me. The fe- 
male — is her name perchance 
Tiress?” 

I glanced down at the inventory 
chart until I found the Stortulian 
entry. “Yes, that’s her name.” 

The little being immediately 
emitted a soul-shaking gasp. “It is 
she! It is she!” 

“I’m afraid we don’t have room 
for any more — ” 

“You are not in full understand- 
ing of my plight. The female Ti- 



ress, she is — was — my own Fire- 
sent spouse, my comfort and my 
warmth, my life and my love.” 
“Funny,” I said. “When we 
signed her three years ago, she 
said she was single. It’s right here 
on the chart.” 

“She lied! She left my burrow 
because she longed to see the 
splendors of Earth. And I am 
alone, bound by our sacred cus- 
toms never to remarry, languish- 
ing in sadness and pining for her 
return. You must take me to 
Earth!” 

“But - ” 

“I must see her — her and this 
disgrace-bringing lover of hers. I 
must reason with her. Earthman, 
can’t you see I must appeal to her 
inner flame? I must bring her 
back!” 

My face was expressionless. 
“You don’t really intend to join 
our organization at all — you just 
want free passage to Earth?” 

“Yes, yes!” wailed the Stortu- 
lian. “Find some other member of 
my race, if you must! Let me have 
my wife again, Earthman! Is your 
heart a dead lump of stone?” 

TT isn’t, but another of my prin- 
ciples is to refuse to be swayed 
by sentiment. I felt sorry for this 
being’s domestic troubles, but I 
wasn’t going to break up a good 
act just to make an alien squirrel 
happy — not to mention footing 
the transportation.

I said, “I don’t see how we can 
manage it. The laws are very 
strict on the subject of bringing 
alien life to Earth. It has to be 
for scientific purposes only. And if 
I know in advance,, that your pur- 
pose in coming isn’t scientific, I 
can’t in all conscience lie for you, 
can I?” 

“Well - ” 

“Of course not.” I took advan- 
tage of his pathetic upset to steam 
right along. “Now if you had come 
in here and simply asked me to 
sign you up, I might conceivably 
have done it. But no — you had to 
go unburden your heart to me.” 

“I thought the truth would move 
you.” 

“It did. But in effect you’re now 
asking me to conspire in a fraudu- 
lent criminal act. Friend, I can’t 
do it. My reputation means too 
much to me,” I said piously. 

“Then you will refuse me?” 

“My heart melts to nothingness 
for you. But I can’t take you to 
Earth.” 

“Perhaps you will send my wife 
to me here?” 

There’s a clause in every con- 
tract that allows me to jettison an 
unwanted specimen. All I have to 
do is declare it no longer of sci- 
entific interest, and the World 
Government will deport the un- 
desirable alien back to its home 
world. But I wouldn’t pull a low 
trick like that on our female Stor- 
tulian. 



I said, “I’ll ask her about com- 
ing home. But I won’t ship her 
back against her will. And maybe 
she’s happier where she is.” 

The Stortulian seemed to 
shrivel. His eyelids closed half- 
way to mask his tears. He turned 
and shambled slowly to the door, 
walking like a living dishrag. In 
a bleak voice, he said, “There is 
no hope then. All is lost. I will 
never see my soulmate again. Good 
day, Earthman.” 

He spoke in a drab monotone 
that almost, but not quite, had me 
weeping. I watched him shuffle 
out. I do have some conscience, 
and I had the uneasy feeling I had 
just been talking to a being who 
was about to commit suicide on 
my account. 

4 BOUT fifty more applicants 
were processed without a 
hitch. Then life started to get com- 
plicated again. 

Nine of the fifty were okay. The 
rest were unacceptable for one 
reason or another, and they took 
the bad news quietly enough. The 
haul for the day so far was close 
to two dozen new life-forms under 
contract. 

I had just about begun to forget 
about the incidents of the Kaller- 
ian’s outraged pride and the Stor- 
tulian’s flighty wife when the door 
opened and the Earthman who 
called himself Ildwar Gorb of 
Wazzenazz XIII stepped in. 



BIRDS OF A FEATHER 



61 



“How did you get in here?” I 
demanded. 

“Your man happened to be 
looking the wrong way,” he said 
cheerily. “Change your mind about 
me yet?” 

“Get out before I have you 
thrown out.” 

Gorb shrugged. “I figured you 
hadn’t changed your mind, so I’ve 
changed my pitch a bit. If you 
won’t believe I’m from Wazzenazz 
XIII, suppose I tell you that I am 
Earthborn, and that I’m looking 
for a job on your staff.” 

“I don’t care what your story is! 
Get out or — ” 

“ — you’ll have me thrown out. 
Okay, okay. Just give me half a 
second. Corrigan, you’re no fool, 
and neither am I — but that fel- 
low of yours outside is. He doesn’t 
know how to handle alien beings. 
How many times today has a life- 
form come in here unexpectedly?” 

I scowled at him. “Too damn 
many.” 

“You see? He’s incompetent. 
Suppose you fire him, take me on 
instead. I’ve been living in the 
outworlds half my life; I know all 
there is to know about alien life- 
forms. You can use me, Corrigan.” 

I took a deep breath and glanced 
all around the paneled ceiling of 
the office before I spoke. “Listen, 
Gorb, or whatever your name is, 
I’ve had a hard day. There’s been 
a Kallerian in here who just about 
threatened murder, and there’s 



been a Stortulian in here who’s 
about to commit suicide because of 
me. I have a conscience and it’s 
troubling me. But get this: I just 
want to finish off my recruiting, 
pack up and go home to Earth. I 
don’t want you hanging around 
here bothering me. I’m not looking 
to hire new staff members, and if 
you switch back to claiming you’re 
an unknown life-form from Waz- 
zenazz XIII, the answer is that 
I’m not looking for any of those 
either. Now will you scram or — ” 

The office door crashed open at 
that point and Heraal, the Kaller- 
ian, came thundering in. He was 
dressed from head to toe in glitter- 
ing metalfoil, and instead of his 
ceremonial blaster, he was wielding 
a sword the length of a human 
being. Stebbins and Auchinleck 
came dragging helplessly along in 
his wake, hanging desperately to 
his belt. 

“Sorry, Chief,” Stebbins gasped. 
“I tried to keep him out, but — ” 

Heraal, who had planted himself 
in front of my desk, drowned him 
out with a roar. “Earthman, you 
have mortally insulted the Clan 
Gursdrinn!” 

CiTTING with my hands poised 
^ near the meshgun trigger, I 
was ready to let him have it at 
the first sight of actual violence. 

Heraal boomed, “You are re- 
sponsible for what is to happen 
now. I have notified the authori- 



62 



GALAXY 



ties and you prosecuted will be 
for causing the death of a life- 
form! Suffer, Earthborn ape! Suf- 
fer!” 

“Watch it, Chief,” Stebbins 
yelled. “He’s going to — ” 

An instant before my numb fin- 
gers could tighten on the meshgun 
trigger, Heraal swung that huge 
sword through the air and plunged 
it savagely through his body. He 
toppled forward onto the carpet 
with the sword projecting a couple 
of feet out of his back. A few drib- 
lets of bluish-purple blood spread 
from beneath him. 

Before I could react to the big 
life-form’s hara-kiri, the office door 
flew open again and three sleek 
reptilian beings entered, garbed in 
the green sashes of the local police 
force. Their golden eyes goggled 
down at the figure on the floor, 
then came to rest on me. 

“You are J. F. Corrigan?” the 
leader asked. 

“Y-yes.” 

“We have received word of a 
complaint against you. Said com- 
plaint being — ” 

“ — that your unethical actions 
have directly contributed to the 
untimely death of an intelligent 
life-form,” filled in the second of 
the Ghrynian policemen. 

“The evidence lies before us,” 
intoned the leader, “in the cadaver 
of the unfortunate Kallerian who 
filed the complaint with us several 
minutes ago.” 



“And therefore,” said the third 
lizard, “it is our duty to arrest you 
for this crime and declare you sub- 
ject to a fine of no less than $100,- 

000 Galactic or two years in 
prison.” 

“Hold on!” I stormed. “You 
mean that any being from any- 
where in the Universe can come 
in here and gut himself on my 
carpet, and I’m responsible?” 
“This is the law. Do you deny 
that your stubborn refusal to yield 
to this late life-form’s request lies 
at the root of his sad demise?” 
“Well, no, but - ” 

“Failure to deny is admission 
of guilt. You are guilty, Earthman.” 

^LOSING my eyes wearily, I 
tried to wish the whole bab- 
bling lot of them away. If I had to, 

1 could pony up the hundred-grand 
fine, but it was going to put an 
awful dent in this year’s take. And 
I shuddered when I remembered 
that any minute that scrawny little 
Stortulian was likely to come burst- 
ing in here to kill himself too. Was 
it a fine of $100,000 per suicide? 
At that rate, I could be out of 
business by nightfall. 

I was spared further such mor- 
bid thoughts by yet another unan- 
nounced arrival. 

The small figure of the Stor- 
tulian trudged through the open 
doorway and stationed itself limply 
near the threshold. The three 
Ghrynian policemen and my three 



64 



GALAXY 



assistants forgot the dead Kallerian 
for a moment and turned to eye 
the newcomer. 

I had visions of unending trou- 
bles with the law here on Ghryne. 
I resolved never to come here on 
a recruiting trip again — or, if I 
did come, to figure out some more 
effective way of screening myself 
against crackpHDts. 

In heart-rending tones, the Stor- 
tulian declared, “Life is no longer 
worth living. My last hope is gone. 
There is only one thing left for 
me to do.” 

I was quivering at the thought 
of another hundred thousand 
smackers going down the drain. 
“Stop him, somebody! He’s going 
to kill himself! He’s - ” 

Then somebody sprinted toward 
me, hit me amidships, and knocked 
me flying out from behind my 
desk before I had a chance to fire 
the meshgun. My head walloped 
the floor, and for five or six sec- 
onds, I guess I wasn’t fully aware 
of what was going on.‘ 

Gradually the scene took shape 
around me. There was a monstrous 
hole in the wall behind my desk; 
a smoking blaster lay on the floor, 
and I saw the three Ghrynian 
policemen sitting on the raving 
Stortulian. The man who called 
himself Ildwar Gorb was getting 
to his feet and dusting himself off. 

He helped me up. “Sorry to 
have had to tackle you, Corrigan. 
But that Stortulian wasn’t here to 



commit suicide, you see. He was 
out to get you.” 

I weaved dizzily toward my 
desk and dropped into my chair. 
A flying fragment of wall had de- 
flated my pneumatic cushion. The 
smell of ashed plaster was every- 
where. The police were effectively 
cocooning the struggling little 
alien in an unbreakable tangle- 
mesh. 

“Evidently you don’t know as 
much as you think you do about 
Stortulian psychology, Corrigan,” 
Gorb said lightly. “Suicide is com- 
pletely abhorrent to them. When 
they’re troubled, they kill the per- 
son who caused their trouble. In 
this case, you.” 

T BEGAN to chuckle— more of a 
tension-relieving snicker than 
a full-bodied laugh. 

“Funny,” I said. 

“What is?” asked the self-styled 
Wazzenazzian. 

“These aliens. Big blustery He- 
raal came in with murder in his 
eye and killed himself, and the 
pint-sized Stortulian who looked 
so meek and pathetic damn near 
blew my head off.” I shuddered. 
“Thanks for the tackle job.” 

“Don’t mention it,” Gorb said. 

I glared at the Ghrynian police. 
“Well? What are you waiting for? 
Take that murderous little beast 
out of here! Or isn’t murder against 
the local laws?” 

“The Stortulian will be duly 



B I RDS OF A FEATHER 



65 



punished,” replied the leader of 
the Ghrynian cops calmly. “But 
there is the matter of the dead 
Kallerian and the fine of — ” 

“ — one himdred thousand dol- 
lars. I know.” I groaned and turned 
to Stebbins. “Get the Terran Con- 
sulate on the phone, Stebbins. 
Have them send down a legal ad- 
viser. Find out if there’s any way 
we can get out of this mess with 
our skins intact.” 

“Right, Chief.” Stebbins moved 
toward the visiphone. 

Gorb stepped forward and put 
a hand on his chest. 

“Hold it,” the Wazzenazzian 
said crisply. “The Consulate can’t 
help you. I can.” 

“You?” I said. 

“I can get you out of this cheap.” 
“How cheap?” 

Gorb grinned rakishly. “Five 
thousand in cash plus a contract 
as a specimen with your outfit. In 
advance, of course. That’s a heck 
of a lot better than forking over 
a hundred grand, isn’t it?” 

I eyed Gorb uncertainly. The 
Terran Consulate people probably 
wouldn’t be much help; they tried 
to keep out of local squabbles un- 
less they were really serious, and 
I knew from past experiences that 
no officials ever worried much 
about the state of my pocketbook. 
On the other hand, giving this sly- 
ster a contract might be a risky 
proposition. 

“Tell you what,” I said finally. 



“You’ve got yoxu-self a deal — but 
on a contingency basis. Get me out 
of this and you’ll have five grand 
and the contract. Otherwise, 
nothing.” 

Gorb shrugged. “What have I 
to lose?” 

TJEFORE the police could in- 
terfere, Gorb trotted over to 
the hulking corpse of the Kallerian 
and fetched it a mighty kick. 

“Wake up, you faker! Stop 
playing possum and stand up! You 
aren’t fooling anyone!” 

The Ghrynians got off the hud- 
dled little assassin and tried to 
stop Gorb. “Your pardon, but the 
dead require your respect,” began 
one of the lizards mildly. 

Gorb whirled angrily. “Maybe 
the dead do — but this character 
isn’t dead!” 

He knelt and said loudly in the 
Kallerian’s dishlike ear, “You 
might as well quit it, Heraal. 
Listen to this, you shamming 
mountain of meat — your mother 
knits doilies for the Clan Ver- 
drokh!” 

The supposedly dead Kallerian 
eniitted a twenty-cycle rumble 
that shook the floor, and clambered 
to his feet, pulling the sword out 
of his body and waving it in the 
air. Gorb leaped back nimbly, 
snatched up the Stortulian’s fallen 
blaster, and trained it neatly on 
the big alien’s throat before he 
could do any damage. The Kaller- 



66 



GALAXY 



ian grumbled and lowered his 
sword. 

I felt groggy. I thought I knew 
plenty about non-terrestrial life- 
forms, but I was learning a few 
things today. “I don’t understand. 
How - ” 

The police were blue with cha- 
grin. “A thousand pardons, Earth- 
man. There seems to have been 
some error.” 

“There seems to have been a 
cute little con game,” Gorb re- 
marked quietly. 

I recovered my balance. “Try to 
milk me of a hundred grand when 
there’s been no crime?” I snapped. 
“I’ll say there’s been an error! If I 
weren’t a forgiving man, I’d clap 
the bunch of you in jail for at- 
tempting to defraud an Earthmanl 
Get out of here! And take that 
would-be murderer with you!” 

They got, and they got fast, 
burbling apologies as they went. 
They had tried to fox an Earth- 
man, and that’s a dangerous sport. 
They dragged the cocooned form 
of the Stortulian with them. The 
air seemed to clear, and peace was 
restored. I signaled to Auchinleck 
and he slammed the door. 

“All right.” I looked at Gorb 
and jerked a thumb at the Kaller- 
ian. “That’s a nice trick. How does 
it work?” 

ORB smiled pleasantly. He 
was enjoying this, I could see. 
“Kallerians of the Clan Gursdrinn 



specialize in a kind of mental 
discipline, Corrigan. It isn’t too 
widely known in this area of the 
Galaxy, but men of that clan have 
unusual mental control over their 
bodies. They can cut off circulation 
and nervous-system response in 
large chunks of their bodies for 
hours at a stretch — an absolutely 
perfect imitation of death. And, of 
course, when Heraal put the sword 
through himself, it was a simple 
matter to avoid hitting any vital 
organs en route.” 

The Kallerian, still at gunpoint, 
hung his head in shame. I turned 
on him. “So — try to swindle me, 
eh? You cooked this whole fake 
suicide up in collusion with those 
cops.” 

He looked quite a sight, with 
that gaping slash running clear 
through his body. But the wound 
had begun to heal already. “I re- 
gret the incident, Earthman. I am 
mortified. Be good enough to de- 
stroy this unworthy person.” 

It was a tempting idea, but a 
notion was forming in my show- 
man’s mind. “No, I won’t destroy 
you. Tell me — how often can 
you do that trick?” 

“The tissues will regenerate in 
a few hours.” 

“Would you mind having to kill 
yourself every day, Heraal? And 
twice on Sundays?” 

Heraal looked doubtful. “Well, 
for the honor of my Clan, per- 
haps — ” 



BIRDS OF A FEATHER 



67 



Stebbins said, “Boss, you 
mean — ” 

“Shut up. Heraal, you’re hired 
— $75 a week plus expenses. Steb- 
bins, get me a contract form — and 
type in a clause requiring Heraal 
to perform his suicide stunt at 
least five but no more than eight 
times a week.” 

I felt a satisfied glow. There’s 
nothing more pleasing than to turn 



a swindle into a sure-fire crowd- 
puller. 

“Aren’t you forgetting some- 
thing, Corrigan?” asked Ildwar 
Gorb in a quietly menacing voice. 
“We had a little agreement, you 
know.” 

“Oh. Yes.” I moistened my lips 
and glanced shiftily around the 
office. There had been too many 
witnesses. I couldn’t back down. I 




68 



GALAXY 



had no choice but to write out a 
check for five grand and give Gorb 
a standard alien-specimen con- 
tract. Unless . 

“Just a second,” I said. “To en- 
ter Earth as an alien exhibit, you 
need proof of alien origin.” 

He grinned, pulled out a batch 
of documents. “Nothing to it. 
Ever3dhing’s stamjjed and in or- 
der — and anybody who wants to 



prove these papers are fraudulent 
will have to find Wazzenazz XIII 
first!” 

We signed and I filed the con- 
tracts away. But only then did it 
occur to me that the events of the 
past hour might have been even 
more complicated than they 
looked. Suppose, I wondered, Gorb 
had conspired with Heraal to stage 
the fake suicide, and rung in the 




BIRDS OF A FEATHER 



69 



cops as well — with contracts for 
both of them the price of my get- 
ting off the hook? 

It could very well be. And if it 
was, it meant I had been taken as 
neatly as any chump I’d ever 
conned. 

Carefully keeping a poker face, 
I did a silent burn. Gorb, or what- 
ever his real name was, was going 
to find himself living up to that 
contract he’d signed — every damn 
word and letter of it! 

YI^E left Ghryne later that 
week, having interviewed 
some eleven hundred alien life- 
forms and having hired fifty-two. 
It brought the register of ouf zoo 

— pardon me, the Institute — to 
a nice pleasant 742 specimens 
representing 326 intelligent life- 
forms. 

Ildwar Gorb, the Wazzenazzian 

— who admitted that his real name 
was Mike Higgins, of St. Louis — 
turned out to be a tower of strength 
on the return voyage. It developed 
that he really did know all there 
was to know about alien life-forms. 

When he found out I had turned 
down the 400-foot-long Vegan be- 
cause the upkeep would be too 
big, Gorb-Higgins rushed off to the 
Vegan’s agent and concluded a 
deal whereby we acquired a fer- 
tilized Vegan ovum, weighing 
hardly more than an ounce. Trans- 
porting that was a lot cheaper than 
lugging a full-grown adult Vegan, 



besides which, he assured me that 
the infant beast could be adapted 
to a diet of vegetables without any 
difficulty. 

He made life a lot easier for me 
during the six-week voyage to 
Earth in our specially constructed 
ship. With fifty-two alien life- 
forms aboard, all sorts of dietary 
problems arose, not to mention the 
headaches that popped up over 
■pride of place and the like. The 
Kallerian simply refused to be 
quartered anywhere but on the 
left-hand side of the ship, for ex- 
ample — but that was the side we 
had reserved for low-gravity crea- 
tures, and there was no room for 
him there. 

“We’ll be traveling in hyper- 
space all the way to Earth,” Gorb- 
Higgins assured the stubborn Kal- 
lerian. “Our cosmostatic polarity 
will be reversed, you see.” 

“Hah?” asked Heraal in confu- 
sion. 

“The cosmostatic polarity. If 
you take a bunk on the left-hand 
side of the ship, you’ll be traveling 
on the right-hand side all the way 
there!” 

“Oh,” said the big Kallerian. “I 
didn’t know that. Thank you for 
explaining.” 

He gratefully took the stateroom 
we assigned him. 

Higgins really had a way with 
the creatures, all right. He made 
us look like fumbling amateurs, 
and I had been operating in this 



70 



GALAXY 



business more than fifteen years. 

Somehow Higgins managed to 
be on the spot whenever trouble 
broke out. A highly strung Nor- 
vennith started a feud with a pair 
of Vanoinans over an alleged 
moral impropriety; Norvennithi 
can be very stuffy sometimes. But 
Gorb convinced the outraged being 
that what the Vanoinans were do- 
ing in the washrooni was perfectly 
proper. Well, it was, but I’d never 
have thought of using that par- 
ticular analogy. 

I could list half a dozen other 
incidents in which Gorb-Higgins’ 
special knowledge of outworld be- 
ings saved us from annoying has- 
sles on that trip back. It was the 
first time I had ever had another 
man with brains in the organiza- 
tion and I was getting worried. 

When I first set up the Institute 
back in the early 2920s, it was 
with my own capital, scraped to- 
gether while running a compara- 
tive biology show on Betelgeuse 
IX. I saw to it that I was the sole 
owner. And I took care to hire 
competent but unspectacular men 
as my staffers — men like Stebbins, 
Auchinleck and Ludlow. 

Only now I had a viper in my 
bosom, in the person of this Ildwar 
Gorb-Mike Higgins. He could 
think for himself. He knew a good 
racket when he saw one. We were 
birds of a feather, Higgins and I. 
I doubted if there was room for 
both of us in this outfit. 

BIRDS OF A FEATHER 



I SENT for him just before we 
were about to make Earthfall, 
offered him a few slugs of brandy 
before I got to the point. “Mike, 
I’ve watched the way you handled 
the exhibits on the way back here.” 
“The other exhibits,” he pointed 
out. “I’m one of them, not a staff 
man.” 

“Your Wazzenazzian status is 
just a fiction cooked up to get you 
past the immigration authorities, 
Mike. But I’ve got a proposition 
for you.” 

“Propose away.” 

“I’m getting a little too rid for 
this starcombing routine,” I said. 
“Up to now, I’ve been doing my 
own recruiting, but only because I 
couldn’t trust anyone else to do the 
job. I think you could handle it, 
though.” I stubbed out my ciga- 
rette and lit another. “Tell you 
what, Mike — I’ll rip up your con- 
tract as an exhibit, and I’ll give 
you another one as a staffman, 
paying twice as much. Your job 
will be to roam the planets finding 
new material for us. How about 
it?” 

I had the new contract all 
drawn up. I pushed it toward him, 
but he put his hand down over 
mine and smiled amiably as he 
said, “No go.” 

“No? Not even for twice the 
pay?” 

“I’ve done my own share of 
roaming,” he said. “Don’t offer me 
more money. I just want to settle 

71 



down on Earth, Jim. I don’t care 
about the cash. Honest.” 

It was very touching, and also 
very phony, but there was nothing 
I could do. I coudn’t get rid of 
him that way. I had to bring him 
to Earth. 

The immigration officials argued 
about his papers, but he’d had the 
things so cleverly faked that there 
was no way of proving he wasn’t 
from Wazzenazz XIII. We set him 
up in a key spot of the building. 

The Kallerian, Heraal, is one 
of our top attractions now. Every 
day at two in the afternoon, he 
commits ritual suicide, and soon 
afterward rises from death to the 
accompaniment of a trumpet fan- 
fare. The four other Kallerians we 
had before are wildly jealous of 
the crowds he draws, but they’re 
just not trained to do his act. 

But the unquestioned number 
one attraction here is confidence 
man Mike Higgins. He’s billed as 
the only absolutely human life- 
form from an extraterrestrial 
planet, and though we’ve had our 
share of debunking, it has only in- 
creased business. 

Funny that the biggest draw at a 
zoo like ours shopld be a home- 
grown Earthman, but that’s show 
business. 

A COUPLE of weeks after we 
got back, Mike added a new 
wrinkle to the act. He turned up 
with a blonde showgirl named 



Marie, and now we have a Woman 
from Wazzenazz too. It’s more fun 
for Mike that way. And downright 
clever. 

He’s too clever, in fact. Like I 
said, I appreciate a good confi- 
dence man, the way some people 
appreciate fine wine. But I wish I 
had left Ildwar Gorb back on 
Ghryne, instead of signing him up 
with us. 

Yesterday he stopped by at my 
office after we had closed down 
for the day. He was wearing that 
pleasant smile he always wears 
when he’s up to something. 

He accepted a drink, as usual, 
and then he said, “Jim, I was 
talking to Lawrence R. Fitzgerald 
yesterday.” 

“The little Regulan? The green 
basketball?” 

“That’s the one. He tells me he’s 
only getting $50 a week. And a lot 
of the other boys here are drawing 
pretty low pay too.” 

My stomach gave a warning 
twinge. “Mike, if you’re looking 
for a raise, I’ve told you time and 
again you’re worth it to me. How 
about twenty a week?” 

He held up one hand. “I’m not 
angling for a raise for me, Jim.” 

“What then?” 

He smiled beatifically. “The 
boys and I held a little meeting 
yesterday evening, and we ah 
— formed a union, with me as 
leader. I’d like to discuss the idea 
of a general wage increase for 



72 



GALAXY 



every one of the exhibits here.” 
“Higgins, you blackmailer, how 
can I afford — ” 

“Easy,” he said. “You’d hate to 
lose a few weeks’ gross, wouldn’t 
you?” 

“You mean you’d call a strike?” 
He shrugged. “If you leave me 
no choice, how else can I protect 
my members’ interests?” 

After about half an hour of 
haggling, he sweated me into an 
across-the-board increase for the 
entire mob, with a distinct hint of 
further raises to come. But he also 
casually let me know the price 
he’s asking to call off the hounds. 
He wants a partnership in the In- 
stitute; a share in the receipts. 

If he gets that, it makes him a 
member of management, and he’ll 
have to quit as union leader. That 
way I won’t have him to contend 
with as a negotiator. 

But I will have him firmly em- 
bedded in the organization, and 
once he gets his foot in the door, 
he won’t be satisfied until he’s on 
top — which means when I’m out. 

T)UT I’m not licked yet! Not 
after a full lifetime of con- 
niving and swindling! I’ve been 
over and over the angles and 
there’s one thing you can always 
count on — a trickster will always 
outsmart himself if you give him 
the chance. I did it with Higgins. 
Now he’s done it with me. 

He’ll be back here in half an 



hour to find out whether he gets 
his partnership or not. Well, he’ll 
get his answer. I’m going to affirm, 
as per the escape clause in the 
standard exhibit contract he signed, 
that he is no longer of scientific 
value, and the Feds will pick him 
up and deport him to his home 
world. 

That leaves him two equally 
nasty choices. 

Those fake documents of his 
were good enough to get him ad- 
mitted to Earth as a legitimate 
alien. How the World Police get 
him back there is their headache 
— and his. 

If he admits the papers were 
phony, the only way he’ll get out 
of prison will be when it collapses 
of old age. 

So I’ll give him a third choice: 
He can sign an undated confession, 
which I will keep in my safe, as 
guarantee against future finagling. 

I don’t expect to be around for- 
ever, you see, though, with that 
little secret I picked up on Rim- 
baud II, it’ll be a good long time, 
not even barring accidents, and 
I’ve been wondering whom to leave 
the Corrigan Institute of Morpho- 
logical Science to. Higgins will 
make a fine successor. 

Oh, one more thing he will have 
to sign. It remains the Corrigan 
Institute as long as the place is in 
business. 

Try to outcon me, will he?

BIRDS OF A FEATHER

EARTHLIGHT by Arthur C. 
Clarke. Ballantine Books, N. Y., 
$2.75 

C LARKE’S creative and imagi- 
native thinking transports the 
reader to Luna via some of the 
most inspired descriptive writing 
in or out of science fiction. Tack 
all this onto a most plausible and 
subtle plot of agent and counter- 
agent and the result is a thorough- 
going delight. 

The weary theme of conflict 
between Mother Earth and raw- 
material-hungry colonies is given 
a fresh rework and the counter- 



agent is as believable in his role 
as your neighbor’s in his. A sup- 
posed auditor of the lunar observa- 
tory, he is baffled in his search 
among the professional staff for 
the spy, and for good reason. Also, 
the war of rebellion is as credible 
in motivation as that of 1776 was. 
Worth reading and rereading. 

THE SURVIVORS by Tom God- 
win. Gnome Press, N. Y., $3.00 

TF history teaches us anything, 
-*• it’s (to paraphrase) “Don’t sell 
the human people short.” Our race, 
despite its apparent frailty, has 



74 



GALAXY 



managed to survive and thrive, 
witness the Bindibu and Eskimo, 
in the most barren and impossible 
environments. 

Godwin developes this theme 
in a tough novel of the fight for 
_ survival and vengeance of a ship- 
load of settlers, set upon and cast 
away on a desert planet by a race 
of dastards. As if having to fight 
the miserably fluctuating climate, 
the 1.5 gravity and the complete 
lack of workable materials weren’t 
enough, there are two murderous- 
ly alien life-forms. 

The story chronicles the succes- 
sive problems of several genera- 
tions while they laboriously sur- 
vive. Early in their career, they 
figuratively burn their bridges by 
transmitting a weak radioed chal- 
lenge to their malefactors that 
they know will result in reprisal 
when the messages are received 
two hundred years in the future. 

I read this yarn with the same 
glow of pride in the indestructibil- 
ity of the human race that I once 
received from van Vogt’s early 
The Alien. But will we let us live? 

THE BEST SCIENCE FIC- 
TION STORIES AND NOVELS 
edited by T. E. Dikty. Advent, 
Chicago, $3.50 

^ ALLING any anthology in 
any field “The Best” has al- 
ways been an arrogant practice, 
but in science fiction it’s plain mal- 



practice — most of the best stories 
of any year are committed to 
magazine anthologies and authors’ 
collections, so “The Best,” no mat- 
ter who the anthologist, merely 
means the best of whatever is left 
over that the claimant can beat 
the opposition to. For example, of 
the fourteen stories, eight are from 
two magazines — Galaxy has its 
Readers, remember — and, of the 
fourteen, two might legitimately 
contend for top honors, four are 
just good, which isn’t enough for 
a “Best” accolade, four are fair, 
four fill space. 

The two lonely contenders are 
Eric Frank Russell’s “Into Your 
Tent I’ll Creep,” a nastily con- 
vincing indictment of Man’s best 
friend, and Poul Anderson’s “Call 
Me Joe,” a fresh look at an oft- 
done theme, man-made adapta- 
tions to alien environments. 

SPACEWAYS SATELLITE by 
Charles Eric Maine. Avalon Books, 
N. Y., $2.75 

I N writing as in anything else, 
improvement results from appli- 
cation and hard work. Maine is a 
prime example of this parental 
proverb; through sheer output, 
his standards have risen. Though 
not the equal of his recent excel- 
lent High Vacuum, Satellite never- 
theless shows to better advantage 
than his earlier works. Of obvious 
topical interest, it also employs 



★ ★★★★ SHELF 



75 



a provocative gimmick, the Cor- 
pus Delicti legal dodge carried 
skyhigh. 

The story concerns the build- 
ing of Satellite Rocket One in 
Nevada, designed to orbit at great- 
er heights than Vanguards or Sput- 
niks. The nominal hero, Conway, 
is Security Officer and his chief 
concern is to defuse an explosive 
marital tangle. Unfortunately, 
Maine is somewhat uninformed 
concerning governmental supervi- 
sion of vital projects, and here, as 
in other works of his, situations 
develop by default and key char- 
acters possess unbelievable naivete. 
But the story makes no preten- 
sions of being in a class with the 
late Cyril Kornbluth’s unforget- 
table Takeoff or Clarke’s Prelude 
to Space and affords a pleasant 
interlude. 

MAN OF EARTH by Algis Bud- 
rys. Ballantine Books, N. Y., $2.00 

13UDRYS has cut a complex 
tale from simple cloth. What 
will a man do with his life if 
given, not only a fresh start, but 
a spanking new identity and physi- 
ognomy? Th^ consensus of authors 
who have previously tried this 
tack is: not much. Budrys dis- 
agrees. He feels that certain char- 
acteristics can be acquired with 
a different physique. 

His protagonist, a soft, coward- 
ly market manipulator, is about 



to lose his illicitly acquired com- 
mercial empire to the SEC, To 
avoid personal punishment, he 
permits the misleadingly named 
Doncaster Industrial Linens to ex- 
change his plump softness and 
hard cash for tall musculature and 
limp pocket. Additionally, Don- 
caster dumps him on Pluto with 
no way to buy his return from 
the bankrupt colony. 

However, the locals are organiz- 
ing a crack, brutally disciplined 
army and his lack of other quali- 
fications and his newfound brawn 
make him a natural GI. This is 
where you can agree or otherwise 
with Budrys. Is it reasonable for 
Sibley to harden outside from 
mind of steal to man of steel? 

One of Budrys’ other main char- 
acters is a person only in the legal 
sense with surprising motives.

fantastic person who lived as 
strangely as he wrote. Almost leg- 
endary, he has been called many 
things, including the Sage of Provi- 
dence and the modern successor to 
E. A. Poe. To many his works are 
the utmost pinnacle of super- 
natural horror; to others, over- 
purpled, adjectival drivel. 

Of certain interest, regardless 
of your opinion, are the savage ar- 
ticle by the late Dr. David H. 
Keller dissecting the psychological 
ticking of the Lovecraft mental 
mechanism, and the equally savage 
rebuttal by Dr. Kenneth Sterling. 

Fritz Leiber and August Der- 
leth contribute, and a famous short 
of Lovecraft’s “The Music of

TEN MILES HIGH, TWO 
MILES DEEP, by Alan Honour. 
Whittlesey House, N. Y., Toronto, 
$3.00 

^ I ■’O my eye, nobody ever looked 
more the personification of pro- 
fessorship than the Piccard twins; 
tall and spare, with Roger Price 
hairdos. Neither did anyone more 
exemplify the spirit of adventure 
in science. Their joint and sepa- 
rate balloon ventures in the thir- 
ties were imagination clutchers 
and the development of Auguste’s 
bathyscaphe along the principles 
of the stratosphere balloons has 
brought the undersea abyss within 
Man’s range. 



Honour’s book does consider- 
ably more honor to the men than 
Auguste’s own Earth, Sky and Sea 
which almost succeeded in con- 
vincing the reader that, shucks, 
’twarn’t nuthin’. 

Recommended as inspirational 
reading for the budding scientist 
as proof that adventure still holds 
a place in science. 

ROCKETS THROUGH SPACE 
by Lester del Rey. John C. Win- 
ston Co., Phila., $3.95 

TN this beautiful book, del Rey 
the storyteller sticks strictly 
to facts. While he is admittedly 
merely correlating known knowl- 
edge, he does so with the added 
advantage of the professional fic- 
tional fictioneer to the added en- 
joyment of the reader. Even 
though the text is pre-Sputnik, 
there is the basic background ma- 
terial necessary for proper imder- 
stahding of theory, fact and prob- 
lems. 

The author calls himself to task, 
a decade and a half belatedly, for 
having gravity affect his charac- 
ters in a story while ■ the ship is 
in free fall. A common error then, 
but something that could never 
pass a schoolboy nowadays. 

James Heugh has contributed 
strikingly beautiful color plates 
and line drawings that would do 
credit to Bonestell himself.

NO SUBSTITUTIONS 



By JIM HARMON 



If it was happening to him, all 
right, he could take that . but 
what if he was happening to it? 



P UTTING people painless- 
ly to sleep is really a de- 
pressing job. It keeps me 
awake at night thinking of all 
those bodies I have sent to the 
vaults, and it interferes to a 
marked extent with my digestion. 
I thought before Councilman Cole- 
man came to see me that there 
wasn’t much that could bother me 
worse. 



Coleman came in the morning 
before I was really ready to face 
the day. My nerves were fairly 
well shot from the kind of work 
I did as superintendent of Dream- 
land. I chewed up my pill to calm 
me down, the one to pep me up, 
the capsule to strengthen my quali- 
ties as a relentless perfectionist. I 
washed them down with gin and 
orange juice and sat back, build-

ing up my fortitude to do business 
over the pxDlished deck of my desk. 

But instead of the usual morn- 
ing run of hysterical relatives and 
masochistic mystics, I had to face 
one of my superiors from the Com- 
mittee itself. 

Councilman Coleman was an 
impressive figure in a tailored 
black tunic. His olive features were 
set off by bristling black eyes and 
a mobile mustache. He probably 
scared most people, but not me. 
Authority doesn’t frighten me any 
more. I’ve put to sleep too many 
megalomaniacs, dictators, and civil 
servants. 

“Warden Walker, I’ve been fol- 
lowing your career with consider- 
able interest,” Coleman said. 

“My career hasn’t been very 
long, sir,” I said modestly. I didn’t 
mention that nobody could last 
that long in my job. At least, none 
had yet. 

“I’ve followed it from the first. 
I know every step you’ve made.” 

I didn’t know whether to be 
flattered or apprehensive. “That’s 
fine,” I said. It didn’t sound right. 

“Tell me,” Coleman said, cross- 
ing his legs, “what do you think of 
Dreamland in principle?” 

“Why, it’s the logical step for- 
ward in penal servitude. Man has 
been heading toward this since he 
first started civilizing himself. 
After all, some criminals can’t be 
helped psychiatrically. We can’t 
execute them or turn them free; 



we have to imprison them.” 

I waited for Coleman’s reaction. 
He merely nodded. 

“Of course, it’s barbaric to think 
of a prison as a place of pimish- 
ment,” I continued. “A prison is a 
place to keep a criminal away 
from society for a specific time so 
he can’t harm that society for that 
time. Punishment, rehabilitation, 
all of it is secondary to that. The 
purpose of confinement is con- 
finement.” 

^I^HE councilman edged forward 
an inch. “And you really think 
Dreamland is the most humane 
confinement possible?” 

“Well,” I hedged, “it’s the most 
humane we’ve found yet. I sup- 
pose living through a — uh — 
movie with full sensory participa- 
tion for year after year can get 
boring.” 

“I should think so,” Coleman 
said emphatically. ‘Warden, don’t 
you sometimes feel the old system 
where the prisoners had the diver- 
sions of riots, solitary confinement, 
television, and jailbreaks may have 
made time easier to serve? Do 
these men ever think they are 
actually living these vicarious ad- 
ventures?” 

That was a question that made 
all of us in the Dreamland service 
uneasy. “No, Councilman, they 
don’t. They know they aren’t real- 
ly Alexander of Macedonia, Tar- 
zan, Casanova, or Buffalo Bill.

They are conscious of all the time 
that is being spent out of their real 
lives; they know they have rela- 
tives and friends outside the 
dream. They know, unless—” 
Coleman lifted a dark eyebrow 
above a black iris. “Unless?” 

I cleared my throat. “Unless 
they go mad and really believe the 
dream they are living. But as you 
know, sir, the rate of madness 
among Dreamland inmates is only 
slightly above the norm for the 
population as a whole.” 

“How do prisoners like that ad- 
just to reality?” 

Was he deliberately trying to 
ask tough questions? “They don’t. 
They think they are having some 
kind of delusion. Many of them 
become schizoid and pretend to 
go along with reality while secret- 
ly ‘knowing’ it to be a lie.” 

Coleman removed a pocket sec- 
retary and broke it open. “About 
these new free-choice models — do 
you think they genuinely are an 
improvement over the old fixed- 
image machines?” 

“Yes, sir,” I replied. “By letting 
the prisoner project his own imagi- 
nation onto the sense tapes and 
giving him a limited amount of 
alternatives to a situation, we can 
observe whether he is conforming 
to society to a larger extent.” 

“I’m glad you said that. 
Walker,” Councilman Coleman 
told me warmly. “As I said, I’ve 
been following your career closely. 



and if you get through the next 
twenty-four-hour period as you 
have through the foregoing part of 
your Dream, you will be awak- 
ened at this time tomorrow. Con- 
gratulations!” 

I sat there and took it. 

He was telling me, the superin- 
tendent of Dreamland, that my 
own life here was only a Dream 
such as I fed to my own prisoners. 
It was unbelievably absurd, a 
queasy little joke of some kind. 
But I didn’t deny it. 

I F it were true, if I had forgotten 
that eversrthing that happened 
was only a Dream, and if I ad- 
mitted it, the councilman would 
know I was mad. It couldn’t be 
true. Yet— 

Hadn’t I thought about it ever 
since I had been appointed war- 
den and transferred from my per- 
sonnel job at the plant? 

Whenever I had come upon two 
people talking, and it seemed as 
if I had come upon those same 
two people talking the same talk 
before, hadn’t I wondered for an 
instant if it couldn’t be a Dream, 
not reality at all? 

Once I had experienced a 
Dream for five or ten minutes. I 
was driving a ground car down a 
spidery road made into a dismal 
tunnel by weeping trees, a dank, 
lavender maze. I had known at 
the time it was a Dream, but still, 
as the moments passed, I became 



80

more intent on the difficult road 
before me, my blocky hands on 
the steering wheel, thick fingers 
typing out the pattern of motion 
on the drive buttons. 

I could remember that. Maybe 
I couldn’t remember being shoved 
into the prison vault for so many 
years for such and such a crime. 

I didn’t really believe this, not 
then, but I couldn’t afford to make 
a mistake, even if it were only 
some sort of intemperate test— as 
I was confident it was, with a 
sweet, throbbing fury against the 
man who would employ such a 
jagged broadsword for prying in 
his bureaucratic majesty. 

“I’ve always thought,” I said, 
“that it would be a good idea to 
show a prisoner what the modern 
penal system was all about by 
giving him a Dream in which he 
dreamed about Dreamland itself.” 

“Yes, indeed,” Coleman con- 
curred. Just that and no more. 

I leaned intimately across my 
beautiful oak desk. “I’ve thought 
that projecting officials into the 
Dream and letting them talk with 
the prisoners might be a more ef- 
fective form of investigation than 
mere observation.” 

“I should say so,” Coleman re- 
marked, and got up. 

I had to get more out of him, 
some proof, some clue beyond the 
prepo.sterous announcement he had 
made. 

“I’ll see you tomorrow at this 



time then, Walker.” The council- 
man nodded curtly and turned to 
leave my office. 

I held onto the sides of my 
desk to keep from diving over and 
teaching him to change his con- 
cept of humor. 

The day was starting. If I got 
through it, giving a good show, I 
would be released from my 
Dream, he had said smugly. 

But if this was a dream, did I 
want probation to reality? 

H ORB IT was a twitchy little 
man whose business tunic 
was the same rodent color as his 
hair. He had a pronounced tic in 
his left cheek. “I have to get back,” 
he told me with compelling 
earnestness. 

“Mr. Horbit - Eddie I said, 
glancing at his file projected on 
my desk pad, “I can’t put you 
back into a Dream. You served 
your full time for your crime. The 
maximum.” 

“But I haven’t adjusted to so- 
ciety!” 

“Eddie, I can shorten sentences, 
but I can’t expand them beyond 
the limit set by the courts.” 

A tfear of frustration spilled out 
of his left eye with the next twitch. 
“But Warden, sir, my psychiatrist 
said that I was unable to cope 
with reality. Come on now. War- 
den, you don’t want a guy who 
can’t cope with reality running 
around loose.” He paused, puz-

zled. “Hell, I don’t know why I 
can’t express myself like I used 
to.” 

He could express himself much 
better in his Dream. He had been 
Abraham Lincoln in his Dream, I 
saw. He had lived the life right 
up to the night when he was tak- 
ing in An American Cousin at the 
Ford Theater. Horbit couldn’t ac- 
cept history that he had no more 
life to live. He only knew that if 
in his delirium he could gaiii 
Dreamland once more, he could 
get back to the hard realities of 
dealing with the problems of Re- 
construction. 

“Please,” he begged. 

I looked up from the file. “I’m 
sorry, Eddie.” 

His eyes narrowed, both of 
them, on the next twitch. “Warden, 
I can always go out and commit 
another anti-social act.” 

“I’m afraid not, Eddie. The file 
shows you are capable of only one 
crime. And you don’t have a wife 
any more, and she doesn’t have a 
lover.” 

Horbit laughed. “Your files 
aren’t infallible. Warden.” 

With one gesture, he ripped 
open his tunic and tore into his 
own flesh. No, not his own flesh. 
Pseudo-flesh. He took out the gun 
that was underneath. 

“The beamer is made of X-ray- 
transparent plastic. Warden, but it 
works as well as one made of steel 
and lead.” 



“Now that you’ve got it in here,” 
I said in time with the pulse in my 
throat, “what are you going to do 
with it?” 

“I’m going to make you go 
down to the vaults and put me 
back to sleep. Warden.” 

I nodded. “I suppose you can 
do that. But what’s to prevent me 
from waking you up as soon as 
I’ve taken away your gun?” 

“This!” He tossed a sheet of 
paper onto my desk. 

“What’s this?” I asked unneces- 
sarily. I could read it. 

“A confession that you accepted 
a bribe to put me back to sleep,” 
Horbit said, his tic beating out a 
feverish tempo. “As soon as you’ve 
signed it. I’ll use your phone to 
have it telefaxed to the Registrar 
of Private Documents.” 

I had to admire the thought be- 
hind the idea. Horbit was con- 
vinced that I was only a figment 
of his unfocused imagination, but 
he was playing the game with un- 
compromising logic, trusting that 
even madness had hard and tight 
rules behind it. 

There was also something else 
I admired about the plan. 

It could work. 

Once he fed that document to 
the archives, I would be obligated 
to help him even without the gun. 
My word would probably be taken 
that I had been forced to do it at 
gunpoint, but there would always 
be doubts, enough to wreck my

career when it came time for pro- 
motion. 

Nothing like this had ever hap- 
pened in my years as warden. 

S UDDENLY, Coleman’s words 
hit me in the back of the neck. 
If I got through the next twenty- 
four hours. This had to be some 
kind of test. 

But a test for what? 

Had I been deliberately told 
that I was living only a Dream to 
see if my ethics would hold up 
even when I thought I Wasn’t deal- 
ing with reality? 

Or if this was only a Dream, 
was it a test to see if I was moral- 
ly ready tO return to the real, the 
earnest world? 

But if it was a test to see if I 
was ready for reality, did I want 
to pass it? My life was nerve-rack- 
ing and mind-wrecking, but I liked 
the challenge — it was the only 
life I knew or could believe in. 
What was I going to do? 

The only thing I knew was that 
I couldn’t tune in tomorrow and 
find out. 

The time was now. 

Horbit motioned the gun to my 
desk set. “Sign that paper.” 

I reached out and took hold of 
his wrist. I squeezed. 

Horbit’s screams brought in the 
guards. 

I picked up the gun from where 
he had dropped it and handed it 
to Captain Keller, my head guard. 



a tough old bird who wore his 
uniform like armor. 

“Trying to force his way back 
to the sleep tanks,” I told Keller. 

He nodded. “Happened before. 
Back when old man Preston lost 
his grip.” 

Preston had been my predeces- 
sor. He had lost his hold on reality 
like all the others before him who 
had served long as warden of 
Dreamland. A few had quit while 
they were still ahead and spent 
the rest of their lives recuperating. 
Our society didn’t produce indi- 
viduals tough enough to stand the 
strain of putting their fellow hu- 
man beings to sleep for long. 

One of Keller’s men had stabbed 
Horbit’s arm with a hypospray to 
blanket the pain from his broken 
wrist, and the man was quieter. 

“I couldn’t have done it. War- 
den,” Horbit mumbled drowsily. 
“I couldn’t kill anybody. Unless it 
was like that other time.” 

“Of course, Eddie,” I said. 

I had banked on that, hadn’t 
I, when I made my move? 

Or did I? 

Wasn’t it perhaps a matter of 
knowing that all of it wasn’t real 
and that the safety cutoffs in even 
a free-choice model of a Dream 
Machine couldn’t let me come to 
any real harm? I had been sus- 
piciously brave, disarming a dedi- 
cated maniac. With only an hour 
to spare for gym a day, I could 
barely press 350 pounds. I was

hardly in shape for personal com- 
bat. 

On the other hand, maybe I 
actually wanted something to go 
wrong so my sleep sentence would 
be extended. Or was it that, in 
some sane part of my mind, I 
wanted release from unreality bad- 
ly enough to take any risk to 
prove that I was morally capable 
of returning to the real world? 

It was & carrousel and I couldn’t 
catch the brass ring no matter how 
many turns I went spinning 
through. 

I hardly heard Horbit when he 
half-shouted at me as my men led 
him from the room. Glancing up 
sharply, I saw him straining pur- 
posefully against the bonds of 
muscle and narcotic that held 
him. 

“You have to send me back 
now. Warden,” he was shrilling. 
“You have to! I tried to coerce 
you with a gun. That’s a crime. 
Warden— you know that’s a crime! 
I have to be put to sleep!" 

Keller flicked his mustache with 
a thick thumbnail. “How about 
that? You won’t let a guy back 
into the sleepy-bye pads, so he 
pulls a gun on you to make you, 
and that makes him eligible. He 
couldn’t lose. Warden. No, sir, he 
had it made.” 

My answer to Keller was form- 
ing, building up in my jaw 
muscles, but I took a pill and it 
went away. 



“Hold him in the detention quar- 
ters,” I said finally. “I’m going to 
make a study of this.” 

Keller winked knowingly and 
sauntered out of the office, his left 
hand swinging the blackjack the 
Committee had taken away from 
him a decade before. 

The problem of what to do with 
Keller wasn’t particularly atypical 
of the ones I had to solve daily 
and I wasn’t going to let that 
worry me. Much. 

I pressed my button to let Mrs. 
Engle know I was ready for the 
next interview. 

' I ^HEY came. There were the 
-*• hysterical relatives, ^the wives 
and mothers and brothers who de- 
manded that their kin be Awak- 
ened because they were special 
cases, not really guilty, or needed 
at home, or possessed of such awe- 
some talents and qualities as to be 
exempt from the laws of lesser 
men. 

Once in a while I granted a 
parole for a prisoner to see a dy- 
ing mother or if some important 
project was falling apart without 
his help, but most of the time I 
just sat with my eyes propped 
open, letting a sea of vindictive 
screeching and beseeching wailings 
wash around me. 

The relatives and legal talent 
were spaced with hungry-eyed 
mystics who were convinced they 
could contemplate God and their

navels both conscientiously as an 
incarnation of Gautama. To risk 
sounding religiously intolerant, I 
usually kicked these out pretty 
swiftly. 

The onetime inmate who wanted 
back in after a reprieve was fairly 
rare. Few of them ever got that 
crazy. 

But it was my luck to get an- 
other the same day, the day for 
me, as Horbit. 

Paulson was a tall, lean man 
with sad eyes. The clock above 
his sharp shoulder bone said five 
till noon. I didn’t expect him to 
take much out of my limch hour. 

“Warden,” Paulson said, “I’ve 
decided to give myself up. I mur- 
dered a blind beggar the other 
night.” 

“For his pencils?” I asked. 

Paulson shifted uneasily. “No, 
sir. For his money. I needed some 
extra cash and I was stronger than 
he was, so why shouldn’t I take 
it?” 

I examined the projection of his 
file. He was an embezzler, not a 
violent man. He had served his 
time and been released. Conceiv- 
ably he might embezzle again, but 
the Committee saw to it that 
temptation was never again placed 
in his path. He would not commit 
a crime of violence. 

“Look, Paulson,” I said, a trifle 
testily, “if you have so little con- 
science as to kill a blind old man 
for a few dollars, where do you 



suddenly get enough guilt feelings 
to cause you to give yourself up?” 
Paulson tried his insufficient 
best to smile evilly. “It wasn’t 
conscience. Warden. I never lie 
awake a minute whenever I kill 
anybody. It’s just — well, Dream- 
ing isn’t so bad. Last time I was 
Allen Pinkerton, the detective. It 
was exciting. A lot more exciting 
than the kind of life I lead.” 

I nodded solemnly. “Yes, no 
doubt strangling old men in the 
streets can be pretty dull for a 
red-blooded man of action.” 
“Yes,” Paulson said earnestly, 
“it does get to be a humdrum rou- 
tine. I’ve been experimenting with 
all sorts of murders, but I just 
don’t seem to get much of a kick 
out of them now. I’d like to try it 
from the other end as Pinkerton 
again. Of course, if you can’t ar- 
range it, I guess I’ll have to go out 
and see what I can do with, say, 
an ax.” His eye glittered almost 
convincingly. 

“Paulson, you know I could have 
you watched night and day if I 
thought you really were a mur- 
derer. But I can’t send you back 
to the sleep vaults without proof 
and conviction for a crime.” 

“That doesn’t sound very rea- 
sonable,” Paulson objected. “Turn- 
ing loose a homicidal maniac who 
is offering to go back to the vaults 
of his own free will just because 
you lack a little trifling proof of 
his guilt.” 



86 



GALAXY 



“Sure,” I told him, “but I don’t 
want to share the same noose with 
you. My job is to keep the inno- 
cent out and the convicted in. And 
I do my job, Paulson.” 

“But you have to! If you don’t, 
I’ll have to go out and establish 
my guilt with another crime. Do 
you want a crime on your hands, 
Warden?” 

I studied his record. There was 
a chance, just a chance . 

“Do you want to wait voluntari- 
ly in the detention quarters?” I 
asked him. 

He agreed readily enough. 

I watched him out of the office 
and rang for lunch. 

The news on the wall video was 
dull as usual. A man got tired of 
hearing peace, safety, prosperity 
and brotherly love all the time. I 
dug into my strained spinach, raw 
hamburger, and chewed up my 
white pill, my red pill, my ebony 
pill, and my second white pill. The 
gin and tomato juice took the 
taste away. 

I was ready for the afternoon 
session. 

TVy ATRONS were finishing the 
messy job of dragging a hys- 
terical woman out of the office 
when Keller came back. He had 
a stubborn look on his flattened, 
red face. 

“New prisoner asking to see you 
personal,” Keller reported. “Told 
him no. Okay?” 



“No,” I said. “He can see me. 
That’s the law and you know it. 
He isn’t violent, is he?” I asked 
in some concern. The room was 
still in disarray. 

“Naw, he ain’t violent. Warden. 
He just thinks he’s somebody im- 
portant.” 

“Sounds like a case for therapy, 
not Dreamland. Who does he 
think he is?” 

“One of the Committee — Coun- 
cilman Coleman.” 

“Mm-hmm. And who is he real- 
ly, Captain?” 

“Councilman Coleman.” 

I whistled. “What did they nail 
him on?” 

“Misuse of authority.” 

“And he didn’t get a suspended 
for that?” 

“Wasn’t his first offense. Still 
want to see him?” 

I gave a lateral wave of my 
hand. “Of course.” 

My pattern of living — call it 
my office routine — had been re- 
established through the day. I 
hadn’t had a chance to brood 
much over the bombshell Coleman 
had tossed in my lap in the morn- 
ing, but now I could think. 

Coleman entered wearing the 
same black tunic, the same su- 
perior attitude. His black eyes 
fastened on me. 

“Sit down. Councilman,” I di- 
rected. 

He deigned to comply.' 

I studied the files flashed before

me. Several times before, Coleman 
had been guilty of slight misuses 
of his authority; helping his 
friends, harming his enemies. Not 
enough to make him be impeached 
from the Committee. His job was 
so hypersensitive that, if every 
transgression earned dismissal, no 
one could hold the position more 
than a day. Even with the best in- 
tentions, mistakes can be taken for 
deliberate errors. Not to mention 
the converse. For his earlier errors, 
Coleman had first received a sus- 
pended sentence, then two ter- 
minal sentences to be fixed by the 
warden. My predecessors had 
given him first a few weeks, then 
a few months of sleep in Dream- 
land. 

OLEMAN’S eyes didn’t fright- 
en me; I focused right on the 
pupils. “That was a pretty foul 
trick. Councilman. Did you hope 
to somehow frighten me out of 
executing this sentence by what 
you told me this morning?” 

I couldn’t follow his reasoning. 
Just how making me think my 
life was only a Dream such as 
I imposed on my own prisoners 
could help him, I couldn’t see. 

“Warden Walker,” Coleman in- 
toned in his magnificent voice, 
“I’m shocked. 7 am not personally 
monitoring your Dream. The Com- 
mittee as a whole will decide 
whether you are capable of return- 
ing to the real world. Moreover, 



please don’t get carried away. I’m 
not concerned with what you do 
to this sensory projection of my- 
self, beyond how it helps to es- 
tablish your moral capabilities.” 
“I suppose,” I said heavily, “that 
I could best establish my high 
moral character by excusing you 
from this penal sentence?” 

“Not at all,” Councilman Cole- 
man asserted. “According to the 
facts as you know them, I am 
‘guilty’ and must be confined.” 

I was stymied for an instant. 
I had expected him to say that 
I must know that he was inca- 
pable of committing such an error 
and I must pardon him despite 
the misguided rulings of the courts. 
Then I thought of something else. 

“You show symptoms of being 
a habitual criminal, Coleman. I 
think you deserve life.’’ 

Coleman cocked his head 
thoughtfully, concerned. “That 
seems rather extreme. Warden.” 
“You would suggest a shorter 
sentence?” 

“If it were my place to choose, 
yes. A few years, perhaps. But life 
— no, I think not.” 

I threw up my hands. You don’t 
often see somebody do that, but 
I did. I couldn’t figure him. Cole- 
man had wealth and power as a 
councilman in the real world, but 
I had thought somehow he wanted 
to escape to a Dream world. Yet 
he didn’t want to be in for life, 
the way Paulson and Horbit did.

GALAXY 



There seemed to be no point or 
profit in what he had told me that 
morning, nothing in it for him. 

Unless— 

Unless what he said was literal- 
ly true. 

I stood up. My knees wanted to 
quit halfway up, but I made it. 
“This,” I said, “is a difficult de- 
cision for me, sir. Would you make 
yourself comfortable here for a 
time. Councilman?” 

Coleman smiled benignly. “Cer- 
tainly, Warden.” 

I walked out of my office, slow- 
ly and carefully. 

TTORBIT was sitting in his de- 
tention quarters idly flicking 
through a book tape on the Civil 
War when I found him. The tic 
in his cheek marked time with 
every new page. 

“President Lincoln,” I said 
reverently. 

Horbit looked up, his eyes set 
in a clever new way. “You call me 
that. Does it mean I am recover- 
ing? You don’t mean now that 
I’m getting back my right senses?” 

“Mr. President, the situation 
you find yourself in now is some- 
thing stranger and more evil than 
any madness. I am not a phan- 
tom of your mind — I am a real 
man. This wild, distorted place is 
a real place.” 

“Do you think you can pull the 
wool over my eyes, you scamp? 
Mine eyes have seen the glory.” 



“Yes, sir.” I sat down beside 
him and looked earnestly into his 
twitching face. “But I know you 
have always believed in the oc- 
cult.” 

He nodded slowly. “I have often 
suspected this was hell.” 

“Not quite, sir. The occult has 
its own rigid laws. It is perfectly 
scientific. This world is in another 
dimension — one that is not length, 
breadth or thickness — but a real 
one nevertheless.” 

“An interesting theory. Go 
ahead.” 

“This world is more scientifical- 
ly advanced than the one you 
come from — and this advanced 
science has fallen into the hands 
of a well-meaning despot.” 

Horbit nodded again. “The Jef- 
ferson Davis type.” 

He didn’t understand Lincoln’s 
beliefs very well, but I pretended 
to go along with him. “Yes, sir. He 
— our leader — doubts your abili- 
ties as President. He is not above 
meddling in the affairs of an alien 
world if he believes he is doing 
good. He has convicted you to this 
world in that belief.” 

He chuckled. “Many of my 
countrymen share his convictions.” 
“Maybe,” I said. “But many 
here do not. I don’t. I know you 
must return to guide the Recon- 
struction. But first you must con- 
vince our leader of your worth.” 
“How am I going to accomplish 
that?” Horbit asked worriedly. 



NO SUBSTITUTIONS

“You are going to have a com- 
panion from now on, an agent of 
the leader, who will pretend to be 
something he isn’t. You must pre- 
tend to believe in what he claims 
to be, and convince him of your 
high intelligence, moral responsi- 
bilities, and qualities of leader- 
ship.” 

“Yes,” Horbit said thoughtfully, 
“yes. I must try to curb my ten- 
dency for telling off-color jokes. 
My wife is always nagging me 
about that.” 

"P AULSON was only a few 
doors away from Horbit. I 
found him with his long, thin legs 
stretched out in front of him, 
staring dismally into the gloom of 
the room. No wonder he found 
reality so boring and depressing 
with so downbeat a mood cycle. I 
wondered why they hadn’t been 
able to do something about adjust- 
ing his metabolism. 

“Paulson,” I said gently, “I want 
to speak with you.” 

He bolted upright in his chair. 
“You’re going to put me back to 
sleep.” 

“I came to talk to you about 
that,” I admitted. 

I pulled up a seat and adjusted 
the lighting so only his face and 
mine seemed to float bodiless in 
a sea of night, two moons of flesh. 

“Paulson — or should I call you 
Pinkerton?— this will come as a 
shock, a shock I know only a fine 



analytical mind like yours could 
stand. You think your life as the 
great detective was only a Dream 
induced by some miraculous ma- 
chine. But, sir, believe me: that 
life was real.” 

Paulson’s eyes rolled slightly 
back into his head and changed 
their luster. “Then this is the 
Dream. I’ve thought—” 

“No!” I snapped. “This world is 
also real.” 

I went through the same Fourth 
Dimension waltz as I had audi- 
tioned for Horbit. At the end of 
it, Paulson was nodding just as 
eagerly. 

“I could be destroyed for tell- 
ing you this, but our leader is plan- 
ning the most gigantic conquest 
known to any intelligent race in 
the Universe. He is going to con- 
quer Earth in all its possible fu- 
tures and all its possible pasts. 
After that, there are other planets.” 

“He must be stopped!” Paulson 
shouted. 

I laid my palm on his arm. 
“Armies can’t stop him, nor can 
fantastic secret weapons. Only one 
thing can stop him: the greatest 
detective who ever lived. Pinker- 
ton!” 

“Yes,” Paulson said. “I suppose 
I could.” 

“He knows that. But he’s a 
fiend. He wants a battle of wits 
with you, his only possible foe, for 
the satisfaction of making a fool 
of you.” 



90 



GALAXY 



“Easier said than done, my 
friend,” Paulson said crisply. 

“True,” I agreed, “but he is 
devious, the devil! He plans to 
convince you that he also has 
been removed to this world from 
his own, even as you have. He will, 
claim to be Abraham Lincoln.” 
“No!” 

“Yes, and he will pretend to 
find you accidentally and get you 
to help him find a way back to his 
own world, glorying in making a 
fool of you. But you can use every 
moment to learn his every weak- 
ness.” 

“But wait. I know President 
Lincoln well. I guarded him on his 
first inauguration trip. How could 
this leader of yours fool me? Does 
he look like the President?” 

“Not at all. But remember, the 
dimensional shift changes physi- 
cal appearance. You’ve noticed 
that in yourself.” 

“Yes, of course,” Paulson mut- 
tered. “But he couldn’t hoax me. 
My keen powers of deduction 
would have seen through him in 
an instant!” 

T SAW Horbit and Paulson hap- 
pily off in each other’s com- 
pany. Paulson was no longer bored 
by a reality in which he was 
matching wits with the first mas- 
ter criminal of the paratime uni- 
verse, and Horbit was no longer 
hopeless in his quest to gain an- 
other reality because he knew he 



was not merely insane now. 

It was a pair of fantastic stories 
that no man in his right mind 
would believe — but that didn’t 
make them invalid to a brace of 
ex-Sleepers. They wanted to be- 
lieve them. The stories gave them 
what they were after— without me 
having to break the law and put 
them to sleep for crimes they 
hadn’t committed. 

They would find out some day 
that I had lied to them, but may- 
be by that time they would have 
realized this world wasn’t so bad. 

Fortunately, I was confident 
from their psych records that they 
were both incapable of ending their 
little game by homicide, no mat- 
ter how justified they might think 
it was. 

“Hey, Warden,” Captain Keller 
bellowed as I approached my of- 
fice door, “when are you going to 
let me throw that stiff Coleman 
into the sleepy-bye vaults? He’s 
still sitting in there on your furni- 
ture as smug as you please.” 

“You don’t sound as if you like 
our distinguished visitor very well,” 
I remarked. 

“It’s not that. I just don’t think 
he deserves any special privileges. 
Besides, it was guys like him that 
took away our nightsticks. My 
boys didn’t like that. Look at me— 
I’m defenseless!” 

I looked at his square figure. 
“Not quite. Captain, not quite.” 
Now was the time. 



NO SUBSTITUTIONS

I stretched out my wet palm 
toward the door. 

Was or was not Coleman telling 
the truth when he said this life of 
mine was itself only a Dream? If 
it was, did I want to finish my last 
day with the right decision so I 
could return to some alien reality? 
Or did I deliberately want to 
make a mistake so I could con- 
tinue living the opiate of my 
Dream? 

Then, as I touched the door, I 
knew the only decision that could 
have any meaning for me. 

Councilman Coleman didn’t look 
as if he had moved since I had 
left him. He was unwrinkled, un- 
perspiring, his eyes and mustache 
crisp as ever. He smiled at me 
briefly in supreme confidence. 

I changed my decision then, in 
that moment. And, in the next, 
changed it back to my original 
choice. 

“Coleman,” I said, “you can get 
out of here. As warden. I’m grant- 
ing you a five-year probation.” 

The councilman stood up swift- 
ly, his eyes catching little sparks 
of yellow light. “I don’t approve of 
your decision. Warden. Not at all. 
Unless you alter it. I’ll be forced 
to convince the rest of the Com- 
mittee that your decisions are be- 
coming faulty, that you are losing 
your grip just as all your prede- 
cessors did.” 

My muscles relaxed in a spasm 
and it took the fresh flow of 



adrenalin to get me to the chair 
behind my desk. I took a pill. I 
took two pills. 

“Tell me, Councilman, what 
happened to the offer to release 
me from this phony Dream? Now 
you are talking as if this world 
was the real one.” 

Coleman parted his lips, but 
then the planes of his face shifted 
into another pattern. “You never 
believed me.” 

“Almost, but not quite. You 
knew I was on the narrow edge 
in this kind of job, but I’m not as 
far out as you seemed to have 
thought.” 

“I can still wreck yom career, 
you know.” 

“I don’t think so. That would 
constitute a misuse of authority, 
and the next time you turn up 
before me, I’m going to give you 
life in. Dreamland.” 

Coleman sat back down sud- 
denly. 

“You don’t want life as a Sleep- 
er, do you?” I pursued. “You did 
want a relatively short sentence of 
a few months or a few years. I 
can think of two reasons why. The 
answer is probably a combination 
of both. In the first place, you are 
a joy-popper with Dreams— you 
don’t want to live out your life in 
one, but you like a brief Dream 
"very few years like an occasional 
dose of a narcotic. In the second 
place, you probably have political 
reasons for wanting to hide out 



92 



GALAXY 



somewhere in safety for the next 
few years. The world isn’t as placid 
as the newscasts sometimes make 
it seem.” 

TTE didn’t say anything. I didn’t 
think he had to. 

“You wanted to make sure I 
made a painfully scrupulous de- 
cision in your case,” I went on. 
“You didn’t want me to pardon 
you completely because of your 
high position, but at the same time 
you didn’t want too long a sen- 
tence. But I’m doing you no 
favors. You get no time from me, 
Coleman.” 

“How did you decide to do 
this?” he asked. “Don’t tell me you 
never doubted. We’ve all doubted 
since we found out about the ma- 
chines: which was real and which 
was the Dream? How did you de- 
cide to risk this?” 

“I acted the only way I could 



act,” I said. “I decided I had to 
act as if my life was real and that 
you were lying. I decided that be- 
cause, if all this were false, if 
I could have no more confidence 
in my own mind and my own 
senses than that, I didn’t give a 
damn if it were all a Dream.” 
Coleman stood up and walked 
out of my office. 

The clock told me it was after 
five. I began clearing my desk. 

Captain Keller stuck his head 
in, unannounced. “Hey, Warden, 
there’s an active one out here. He 
claims that Dreamland compro- 
mises His plan for the Free Will 
of the Universe.” 

“Well, escort him inside. Cap- 
tain,” I said. 

I put away my pills. Solving 
simple problems such as the new 
visitor presented always helped 
me to relax.

by Reilly, and in charge of the 
project that saved Blaine. From 
her, Blaine learns about 

HEREAFTER, INC., of which 
Rex is a subsidiary. This corpora- 
tion guarantees, for a very high 
fee, the absolute certainty of life 
after death. Blaine learns that 
some people survive naturally and 
pass on to the hereafter. But for 
the majority, the mind disinte- 
grates with the death of the body 
— unless strengthened by Here- 
after Inc.’s treatment. Blaine finds 
out more about the life after death. 
The most understandable part of 
it is 

THE THRESHOLD, an inter- 
face region between Earth and the 
hereafter. Friendly spirits — such 
as Reilly’s dead grandfather — in- 
habit this region and advise the 
living; and in the Threshold there

are minds which have gone in- 
sane during the death trauma, and 
which sometimes appear on Earth 
as ghosts. 

But even with proofs, the or- 
ganized religions do not accept the 
scientific hereafter. Reilly hoped 
to crack this large potential mar- 
ket by bringing a religious leader 
from 1958 to 2112. This man’s 
mind would pass through the 
Threshold, then be pulled into a 
host body. He would have seen 
the hereafter for himself and be 
able to endorse the product. 

T>[/T the experiment failed. In- 
stead they have Blaine — who 
remembers nothing about the 
Threshold. Blaine is, therefore, an 
embarrassment to Rex. Reilly of- 
fers him the expensive hereafter 
treatment tree if Blaine will con- 



sent to commit suicide. Blaine re- 
fuses. Reilly hopes Blaine will 
change his mind when he wit- 
nesses a reincarnation. 

By reincarnating, Reilly plans 
to be reborn in a younger man’s 
body. Reincarnation is dangerous, 
but Reilly fears going to the here- 
after even more. 

FITZSIMMONS, whose body 
Reilly is going to take over, has 
sold himself on the open market, 
in return for the precious hereafter 
treatment. The reincarnation be- 
gins, but there is interference from 
a spirit who fights Reilly for pos- 
session of Fitzsimmons’ body, and 
wins. 

The new possessor of the host 
body can’t remember who he is. 
He is barely able to control the 
corpselike host, which has been 
dead too long for a successful in-

tegration of mind and body. A per- 
son in this state is referred to as 
a zombie. 

The zombie is led away. As 
he passes Blaine, he seems to 
recognize him. He promises — or 
threatens — to see Blaine again, 
once he manages to recover his 
memory. 

Marie Thorne takes Blaine 
away from Rex for his safety, and 
turns him over to 

CARL ORC, for safekeeping. 
This tall, amiable Westerner takes 
Blaine on a round of New York’s 
notorious pleasure spots. In a bar, 
they meet 

JOE, a steerer for Transplant. 
This is an illegal sex game which 
employs a technique whereby one 
can temporarily inhabit the body 
of another man, woman, or animal. 
Blaine refuses. When he finishes 
his drink, he realizes too late that 
Ore has slipped him a knockout 
drop. Blaine recovers conscious- 
ness in a guarded room. There is 
another prisoner there named 
’ RAY MELHILL, who tells him 
that they have been captured by 
Ore’s gang of body-snatchers. Al- 
though there is an open market in 
host bodies, the supply is always 
scarce and costly. The body- 
snatchers sell to rich men who 
wish to attempt reincarnation. 

When Ore and his men come 
for him, Blaine tries to resist. But 
he is seized, chloroformed, and 
carried away. 



^ I ''HOMAS Blaine’s first act of 
consciousness was to find out 
whether he was still Thomas 
Blaine and still occupying his own 
body. The proof was there, ap- 
parent in the asking. They hadn’t 
wiped his mind out yet. 

He was lying on a divan, fully 
dressed. He sat up and heard the 
sound of footsteps outside, com- 
ing toward the door. 

They must have overestimated 
the strength of the anesthetic. He 
still had a chance! 

He moved quickly behind the 
door. It opened, and someone 
walked through. Blaine stepped 
out and swung. 

He managed to check the blow, 
but there was still plenty of force 
left when his big fist struck Marie 
Thorne on the side of her shape- 
ly chin. 

He carried her to the divan. It 
took a while before she recovered 
and looked fuzzily at him. 

“Blaine,” she said, “you’re an 
idiot.” 

“I didn’t know who it was,” said 
Blaine. Even as he said it, he 
realized it wasn’t true. He had 
recognized Marie Thorne a frac- 
tional second before the blow was 
launched; and his well-machined, 
responsive body could have re- 
called the punch even then. But 
an unperceived, uncontrollable 
fury had acted beneath his sane.

GALAXY 



conscious, morally aware level; 
fury had cunningly used urgency 
to avoid responsibility, had seized 
the deceiving instant to smash 
down the cold and uncaring Miss 
Thorne. 

The act hinted at something 
Blaine didn’t care to know about 
himself. He said, “Miss Thorne, 
what in hell is going on?” 

“I’m sorry, Blaine. Ore appar- 
ently didn’t understand why I was 
turning you over to him. He 
thought I wanted you disposed- 
well, I got you back from him as 
soon as I found out.” 

“Thanks,” Blaine said. “Why 
are you doing this, anyhow?” 

“For one thing, I knew the for- 
mer owner of your body. For an- 
other — no, skip that.” 

She fingered her jaw, which was 
discolored and slightly swollen. 
“Well, shall we consider Ourselves 
even? Or do you want another 
clout at me?” 

“One was enough, thank you,” 
Blaine said. 

S HE stood up, somewhat un- 
steadily. Blaine put an arm 
around her to steady her and was 
momentarily disconcerted. He had 
visualized that trim body as whip- 
cord and steel, but in fact it was 
flesh, firm, resilient, surprisingly 
soft. So close, he could see stray 
hairs escaping her tight coiffure, 
and a tiny mole on her forehead 
near the hairline. At that moment. 



Marie Thorne ceased as an ab- 
straction for him and took shape 
as a human being. 

“I can stand by myself,” she 
said. 

“Of course,” said Blaine, but it 
took a long moment to release her. 

“Under the circumstances,” she 
said, looking at him steadily, “I 
think our relationship should re- 
main on a strictly business level.” 

Wonder after wonder! She had 
suddenly begun viewing him as a 
human being, too; she was aware 
of him as a man, and disturbed 
by it. The thought gave him great 
pleasure. It was not, he told him- 
self, that he liked Marie Thorne, 
or even desired her particularly. 
But he wanted very much to throw 
her off balance, scratch enamel off 
the facade, jar that damnable 
poise. 

He said, “Why, certainly. Miss 
Thorne.” 

“I’m glad you feel that way,” 
she told him. “Because, frankly, 
you’re not my type.” 

“What is your type?” 

“I like tall, lean men,” she said. 
“Men with a certain grace, ease 
and sophistication.” 

“But-” 

“Shall we have lunch?” she 
asked easily. 

He followed her out of the 
room, raging inwardly. Had she 
been making fun of him? Tall, 
lean, graceful, sophisticated men? 
That’s what he had been! And un- 



TIME KILLER

der this blond beefy wrestler’s 
body, he still was, if only she had 
eyes to see it! 

And who was jarring whose 
poise? 

LAINE suddenly remembered. 
“Melhill!” 

“What?” 

“Ray Melhill, the man I was 
locked up with! Look, Miss 
Thorne, could you possibly get him 
out? I’ll pay for it as soon as I 
can. He’s a damned nice guy.” 

She looked at him curiously. 
“I’ll see what I can do.” 

She left the room. Blaine 
waited, rubbing his hands to- 
gether, wishing he had Carl Ore’s 
neck between them. Marie Thorne 
returned in a few minutes. 

“I’m very sorry,” she said. “I 
contacted Ore. Mr. Melhill was 
sold an hour after you were re- 
moved. I really am sorry. I didn’t 
know.” 

“I was afraid we wouldn’t make 
it in time,” said Blaine sickly. “I 
think I’d like a drink.” 

“You need it,” she agreed. “I’ll 
take you to my place.” 

Marie’s apartment was large, 
airy, pleasingly feminine, and fur- 
nished with a certain dramatic 
flair. There was more bright color 
than Blaine would have thought 
compatible with Miss Thorne’s 
somber personality, but perhaps 
the vivid yellows and sharp reds 
expressed a wish of some sort, a 



compensation for the restraint of 
her business life. Or perhaps it was 
just the prevailing style. The 
apartment contained the sort of 
gadgetry that Blaine associated 
with the future: self-adjusting 

lighting and air-conditioning, self- 
conforming armchairs, and a push- 
button bar that produced a very 
adequate martini. 

Marie Thorne went into one of 
the bedrooms. She returned in a 
high-collared lounging dress and 
sat down on a couch opposite him. 

“Well, Blaine, what are your 
plans?” 

“I thought I’d ask you for a 
loan.” 

“Certainly. Glad to help out.” 

“In that case, my plan is to find 
a hotel room and start looking for 
a job.” 

“It won’t be easy,” she said, 
“but I know some people who 
might-” 

“I hope this doesn’t sound too 
silly, but I’d rather find a job on 
my own.” 

“No, it doesn’t sound silly. I just 
hope it’s possible. How about some 
dinner?” 

“Fine. Do you cook, too?” 

“I set dials,” she replied. “Let’s 
see. How would you like a genuine 
Martian meal?” 

“No, thanks,” Blaine said. “Mar- 
tian food is tasty, but you’re hun- 
gry an hour later. Would you hap- 
pen to have a steak around the 
place?” 




100 



GALAXY 



M arie set the dials and her 
auto-chef did the rest, se- 
lecting the foods from pantry and 
freezer, peeling, unwrapping, wash- 
ing and cooking them, sniffing and 
tasting them, seasoning and serv- 
ing them, and ordering new items 
to replace those used. The meal 
was perfect, but Marie seemed 
oddly embarrassed about it. She 
apologized to Blaine for the com- 
pletely mechanical operation. After 
all, he came from an age in which 
women had opened their own cans 
and done their own tasting; but 
they’d probably had more leisure 
time too. 

The sun had set by the time 
they finished their coffee. Blaine 
said, “Thank you very much. Miss 
Thorne. Now if you could lend 
me that money. I’ll get started.” 
She looked surprised. “At 
nig’ht?” 

“I’ll find a hotel room. You’ve 
been very kind, but I wouldn’t 
want to presume any further—” 
“You’re not presuming. You can 
start on your own tomorrow.” 
“All right,” Blaine said. His 
mouth was suddenly dry and his 
heart was pounding with suspi- 
cious rapidity. He knew there was 
nothing personal in her invitation, 
but his body didn’t seem to un- 
derstand. It insisted upon react- 
ing hopefully, expectantly even, 
to the controlled and antiseptic 
Miss Thorne. 

She gave him a bedroom and a 



pair of green pajamas. Blaine 
closed the door when she left, un- 
dressed and got into bed. The 
light went out when he told it to. 

In a little while, just as his body 
had counted on, Miss Thorne 
came in wearing something white 
and gossamer. 

They lay side by side in silence. 
Marie Thorne moved closer to 
him. 

He said, “I thought you weren’t 
attracted to my type.” 

“Not exactly. I said I preferred 
tall, lean men.” 

“I was once a tall, lean man.” 

“I suspected it,” she said. 

They were both silent. Blaine 
began to grow uncomfortable and 
apprehensive. What did this mean? 
Had she some fondness for him? 
Or was this simply a custom of 
the age, a sort of Eskimo hospi- 
tality? 

“Miss Thorne,” he said, “I won- 
der if—” 

“Oh, be quiet!” she said, sud- 
denly turning toward him, her 
eyes enormous in the shadowy 
room. “Do you have to question 
everything, Tom?” 

Later, she said dreamily, “Un- 
der the circumstances, I think you 
can call me Marie.” 

TN the morning, Blaine show- 
ered, shaved and dressed. 
Marie dialed a breakfast for them. 
After they had eaten, she gave him 
a small envelope.

“I can lend you more when you 
need it,” she said. “Now about 
finding a job—” 

“You’ve helped me very much,” 
said Blaine. “The rest I’d like to 
do on my own.” 

“If possible. My address and 
telephone number are on the en- 
velope. Please call me as soon as 
you have a hotel.” 

“I will,” Blaine promised, watch- 
ing her closely. There was no hint 
of the Marie of last night. It might 
have been a different person en- 
tirely. But her studied self-pos- 
session was reaction enough for 
Blaine. Enough, at least, for the 
moment. 

At the door, she touched his 
arm. “Tom, please be careful. And 
call me.” 

“I will, Marie,” Blaine said. 

He went down into the city hap- 
py and refreshed, intent upon con- 
quering the world.

T>LAINE’S first idea had been 
to make a round of the yacht- 
design offices. But he decided 
against it simply by picturing a 
yacht designer from 1806 walk- 
ing into an office in 1958. 

The quaint gentleman might be 
very talented, but how would that 
help him when he was asked what 
he knew about metacentric shelf 
analysis, flow diagrams, centers of 
effort, and the best locations for 



RDF and sonar? What company 
would pay him while he learned 
the facts about reduction gears, 
exfoliating paints, tank testing, 
propeller pitch, heat exchange sys- 
tems, synthetic sailcloth and all 
the rest of the advances made in 
a century and a half of scientific 
progress? 

Not a chance, Blaine decided. 
He couldn’t walk into a design 
office 152 years behind the times 
and ask for a job. A job as what? 
Perhaps he could study and catch 
up to 2110 technology. But he’d 
have to do it on his own time. 

Right now, he’d take anything 
he could get. 

He went to a newsstand and 
purchased a microfilm Times and 
a viewer. He walked until he found 
a bench, sat down and turned to 
the classified ads. Quickly he 
skipped past the skilled categories, 
where he couldn’t hope to qualify, 
and came to unskilled labor. He 
read: 

“Set-up man wanted in auto- 
cafeteria. Requires only basic 
knowledge of robotics.” 

“Hull wiper "yvanted, Mar-Col- 
ing liner. Must be Rh positive and 
fortified anticlaustrophobiac.” 

“List man needed for hi-tensile 
bearing decay work. Needs simple 
jsnkling knowledge. Meals in- 
cluded.” 

It was apparent to Blaine that 
even the unskilled labor of 2110 
was beyond his present capacity.

Turning the page to Employment 
for Boys, he read: 

“Wanted, young man interested 
in slic-trug machinery. Good fu- 
ture. Must know basic calculus 
and have working knowledge Hoo- 
tean Equations.” 

“Young Men wanted, sales- 
men’s jobs on Venus. Salary plus 
Commission. Knowledge basic 
French, German, Russian and 
Ourescz.” 

“Delivery, Magazine, Newspaper 
boys wanted by Eth-Col agency. 
Must be able to drive a Sprening. 
Good knowledge of City required.” 
So he couldn’t even qualify as 
a newsboy! 

It was a depressing thought. 
Finding a job was going to be more 
difficult than he had imagined. 
Didn’t anyone dig ditches or carry 
packages in this city? Did robots 
do all the menial work, or did you 
need a Ph.D even to lug a wheel- 
barrow? What sort of world was 
this? 

ITE turned to the front page of 
the Times for an answer, ad- 
justed his viewer and read the 
niws of the day: 

A new spacefield was under 
construction at Oxa. New South 
Mars. 

A poltergeist was believed re- 
sponsible for several industrial fires 
in the Chicago area. Exorcism pro- 
ceedings were under way. 

Rich copper deposits had been 



discovered in the Sigma-G sector 
of the Asteroid Belt. 

Doppelganger activities had in- 
creased in Berlin. 

A new survey was being made 
of octopi villages in the Minda- 
nao Deep. 

A mob in Spenser, Alabama, 
lynched and burned the town’s 
two local zombies. Legal action 
was being taken against the mob 
leaders. 

A noted anthropologist declared 
the Tuamoto Archipelago in 
Oceania to be the last stronghold 
of 20th century simplicity. 

The Atlantic Fish Herders’ As- 
sociation was holding its annual 
convention at the Waldorf. 

A werewolf was unsuccessfully 
tracked in the Austrian Tyrol. Lo- 
cal villages were warned to keep 
a twenty-four-hour watch for the 
beast. 

A bill was introduced into the 
House of Representatives to out- 
law all hunts and gladiatorial 
events. It was defeated. 

A berserker took four lives in 
downtown San Diego. 

Helicopter fatalities reached the 
one million mark for the year. 

Blaine put the newspaper aside, 
more depressed than ever. Ghosts, 
doppelgangers, werewolves, polter- 
geists . 

He didn’t like the sound of 
those vague, grim ancient words 
which today seemed to represent 
actual phenomena. He had already 



TIME KILLER 



103 



met a zombie. He didn’t want to 
encounter any more of the dan- 
gerous side-effects of the here- 
after. 

He started walking again. He 
went through the theater district, 
past glittering marquees, posters 
advertising the gladiatorial events 
at Madison Square Garden, bill- 
boards heralding solidovision pro- 
grams and sensory shows, flashing 
signs proclaiming overtone con- 
certs and Venusian pantomime. 
Sadly, Blaine remembered that he 
might have been part of this daz- 
zling fairyland if only Reilly 
hadn’t changed his mind. He might 
be appearing at one of those 
theaters now, billed as the Man 
from the Past . 

Of course! A Man from the 
Past, Blaine suddenly realized, had 
a unique and indisputable novelty 
value, an inherent talent. The Rex 
Corporation had saved his life 
in 1958 solely in order to use that 
talent. But they had changed their 
minds. Then what was to prevent 
him from using his novelty value 
for himself? And, for that matter, 
what else could he do? Show busi- 
ness looked like the only possible 
business for him. 

13LAINE hurried into a gigantic 
office building and found six 
theatrical agents listed on the 
board. He picked Barnex, Scofield 
& Styles, and took the elevator 
to their offices on the 19th floor. 



He entered a luxurious waiting 
room paneled with gigantic solido- 
graphs of smiling actresses. At the 
far end of the room, a pretty re- 
ceptionist raised an inquiring eye- 
brow at him. 

Blaine went up to her desk. 
“I’d like to see someone about my 
act.” 

“I’m so sorry,” she said. “We’re 
all filled.” 

“This is a very special act.” 

“I’m really terribly sorry. Per- 
haps next week.” 

“Look,” Blaine said, “my act is 
really unique. You see, I’m a man 
from the past.” 

“I don’t care if you’re the ghost 
of Scott Merrivale,” she said sweet- 
ly. “We’re filled. Try us next 
week.” 

Blaine turned to go. A short, 
stocky man breezed past him, nod- 
ding to the receptionist. 

“Morning, Miss Thatcher.” 

“Morning, Mr. Barnex.” 

Barnex! One of the agents! 
Blaine hurried after him and 
grabbed his sleeve. 

“Mr. Barnex,” he said, “I have 
an act—” 

“Everybody has an act,” said 
Barnex. 

“But this act is unique!” 

“Everybody’s act is unique. Let 
go my sleeve, friend. Try us next 
week.” 

“I’m from the past!” Blaine 
cried, suddenly feeling foolish. 

Barnex turned and stared at 



104 



GALAXY 



him. He looked as though he might 
be on the verge of calling the po- 
lice, or Bellevue. But Blaine 
plunged recklessly on. 

“I really am! he said. “I have 
absolute proof. The Rex Corpora- 
tion snatched me out of the past. 
Ask them!” 

“Rex?” Barnex said. “Yeah, I 
heard something about that snatch 
over at Lindy’s . Hmmm. Come 
into my office. Mister—” 

“Blaine, Tom Blaine.” He fol- 
lowed Barnex into a tiny, clut- 
tered cubicle. “Do you think you 
can use me?” 

“Maybe,” Barnex said, motion- 
ing Blaine to a chair. “It depends. 
Tell me, Mr. Blaine, what period 
of the past are you from?” 

“I have an intimate knowledge 
of the nineteen thirties, forties and 
fifties. By way of stage experience, 
I did some acting in college, and 
a professional actress friend of 
mine once told me I had a natural 
way of—” 

“That’s 20th century?” 

“Yes, that’s right.” 

^ I ^ HE agent shook his head. “Too 
bad. Now if you’d been a sixth 
century Swede or a seventh cen- 
tury Jap, I could have found work 
for you. I’ve had no difficulty book- 
ing appearances for our first cen- 
tury Roman or our fourth century 
Saxon, and I could use a couple 
more like them. But it’s damned 
hard finding anyone from those 



early centuries, now that time 
travel is illegal. And B.C. is com- 
pletely out.” 

“But what about the 20th cen- 
tury?” Blaine asked. 

“It’s filled.” 

“Filled?” 

“Sure. Ben Therler from 1953 
gets all the available stage ap- 
pearances.” 

“I see,” Blaine said, getting 
slowly to his feet. “Thanks any- 
how, Mr. Barnex.” 

“Not at all,” said Barnex. “Wish 
I could help. If you’d been from 
any time or place before the 11th 
century, I could probably book 
you. But there’s not much interest 
in recent stuff like the 19th and 
20th centuries . Say, why don’t 
you go see Therler? It isn’t like- 
ly, but maybe he can use an 
understudy or something.” He 
scrawled an address on a piece of 
paper and handed it to Blaine. 

Blaine took it, thanked him 
again, and left. 

In the street, he stood for a mo- 
ment, cursing his luck. His one 
unique and indisputable talent, his 
novelty value, had been usurped 
by Ben Therler of 1953! Really, 
he thought, time travel should be 
kept more exclusive. It just wasn’t 
fair to drop a man here and then 
ignore him. 

He wondered what sort of man 
Therler was. Well, he’d find out. 
Even if Therler didn’t need an 
understudy, it would be a pleas- 



TIME KILLER 



105 



ure and relief to talk to someone 
from home. And Therler, who had 
lived here longer, might have some 
ideas on what a 20th century man 
could do in 2110. 

Blaine flagged a helicab and 
gave the address. In fifteen min- 
utes, he was in Therler’s apart- 
ment building, pressing the door- 
bell. 

A SLEEK, chubby, complacent- 
looking man opened the door. 
He was wearing a pork-pie hat, 
a tweed jacket with heavily 
padded shoulders, a narrow regi- 
mental-stripe tie, pegged gray 
flannel slacks and orange suede 
shoes. 

“You the photographer?” he 
asked. “You’re too early.” 

Blaine shook his head. “Mr. 
Therler, you’ve never met me be- 
fore. I’m from your own century. 
I’m from 1958.” 

“Is that so?” said Therler, with 
obvious suspicion. 

“It’s the truth,” Blaine said. “I 
was snatched by the Rex Corpora- 
tion. You can check my story with 
them.” 

Therler shrugged his shoulders. 
“Well, what is it you want?” 

“I was hoping you might be 
able to use an understudy or some- 
thing—” 

“No, no, I never use an un- 
derstudy,” Therler said, starting 
to close the door. 

“I didn’t think you did. The 



real reason I came was just to 
talk to you. It gets pretty lonely 
being out of one’s century. I 
wanted to talk to someone from 
my own age. I thought maybe 
you’d feel that way, too.” 

“Me? Oh!” Therler said, smil- 
ing with sudden stage warmth. 
“Oh, you mean about the good 
old twentieth century! I’d love to 
talk to you about it sometime, pal. 
Little old New York! The Dodg- 
ers and Yankees, the hansoms in 
the park, the roller-skating rink 
in Rockefeller Plaza. I sure miss 
it all! But I’m afraid I’m a little 
busy now.” 

“Certainly,” Blaine said. “Some 
other time.” 

“Fine! I’d really love to!” said 
Therler, smiling even more bril- 
liantly. “Call my secretary, will 
you, old man? Schedules, you 
know. We’ll have a really great 
old gab some one of these days. 
I suppose you could use a spare 
dollar or two—” 

Blaine shook his head. 

“Then ’bye,” Therler said hearti- 
ly. “And do call soon.” 

Blaine hurried out of the build- 
ing. It was bad enough being 
robbed of your novelty value; it 
was worse being robbed by an out- 
and-out phony, a temporal fraud 
who’d never been within a hun- 
dred years of 1953. The Rockefel- 
ler ro//er-skating rink! And those 
clothes! Ever 5 Tthing about the man

But Blaine was probably the 
only man in 2110 who could de- 
tect the impostor. 

' I ■’HAT afternoon, Blaine pur- 
-*■ chased a change of clothing 
and a shaving kit. He found a 
room in a cheap hotel on Ninth 
Avenue. For the next week, he 
continued looking for work. 

He tried the restaurants, but 
found that human dishwashers 
were a thing of the past. At the 
docks and spaceports, robots were 
doing most of the heavy work. One 
day he was tentatively approved 
for a position as package-wrapping 
inspector at Gimbel-Macy’s. But 
the personnel department, after 
carefully studying his personality 
profile, irritability index and sug- 
gestibility rating, vetoed him in 
favor of a dull-eyed little man 
from Queens who held a master’s 
degree in packaging. 

Blaine was wearily returning to 
his hotel one evening when he 
recognized a face in the dense 
crowd. It was a man he would 
have known instantly, anywhere. 
He was about Blaine’s age, a com- 
pact, red-headed, snub-nosed man 
with slightly protruding teeth and 
a small red blotch on his neck. 
He carried himself with a certain 
jaunty assurance, the unquench- 
able confidence of a man for whom 
something always turns up. 

“Ray!” Blaine shouted. “Ray 
Melhill!” He pushed through the 



crowd and seized him by the arm. 
“Ray! How’d you get out?” 

The man pulled his arm away 
and smoothed the sleeve of his 
jacket. “My name is not Melhill.” 
“It’s not? Are you sure?” 

“Of course I am sure,” the man 
said, starting to move away. 

Blaine stepped in front of him. 
“Wait a minute. You look exact- 
ly like him, even down to the 
radiation scar. Are you sure you 
aren’t Ray Melhill, a flow-con- 
trol man off the spaceship 
Bremen?” 

“Quite certain,” the man said 
coldly. “You have confused me 
with someone else, young man.” 
Blaine stared hard as the man 
started to walk away. Then he 
reached out, caught the man by a 
shoulder and swung him around. 

“You dirty body-thieving swine!” 
Blaine shouted, his big right fist 
shooting out. 

The man who so exactly re- 
sembled Melhill was knocked back 
against a building and slid grog- 
gily to the pavement. Blaine 
started for him, and people moved 
quickly out of his way. 

“Berserker!” a woman screamed. 
Someone else took up the cry. 
Blaine caught sight of a blue uni- 
form shoving through the crowd 
toward him. 

A flathat! Blaine ducked into 
the crowd. He turned a corner 
quickly, then another, slowed to 
a walk and looked back. The po- 



TIME KILLER

liceman was not in sight. Blaine 
started walking again to his hotel. 

It had been Melhill’s body, but 
Ray no longer occupied it. There 
had been no last-minute reprieve 
for him, no final chance. His body 
had been taken from him and sold 
to the old man whose querulous 
mind wore the jaunty body like 
a suit of ill-fitting, too-youthful 
clothes. 

Now Blaine knew his friend was 
really dead. He drank silently to 
him in a neighborhood bar before 
returning to the hotel. 

IJLAINE was stopped by the 
” clerk as he passed the desk. 
“Blaine? Got a message for you. 
Just a minute.” 

Blaine waited, wondering whom 
it could be from. Marie? But he 
hadn’t called Marie yet, and wasn’t 
planning to until he found work. 

The clerk came back and 
handed him a slip of paper. The 
message read : “There is a Commu- 
nication awaiting Thomas Blaine 
at the Spiritual Switchboard, 23rd 
Street Branch. Hours, nine to 
five.” 

“I wonder how anybody knew 
where I was,” Blaine said. 

“Spirits got their ways,” the 
clerk told him. “Man I know, 
his dead mother-in-law tracked 
him down through three aliases, a 
Transplant and a complete skin 
job. He was hiding from her in 
Ethiopia.” 



“I don’t have any dead mother- 
in-law,” said Blaine. 

“No? Who you figure’s trying 
to reach you?” the clerk asked. 

“I’ll find out tomorrow and let 
you know,” Blaine said. 

But his sarcasm was wasted. 
The clerk had already turned back 
to his correspondence course on 
Atomic Engine Maintainence. 

11 . 

’ I ■’HE 23rd Street Branch of the 
Spiritual Switchboard was a 
large graystone building near Third 
Avenue. Engraved above the door 
was the statement: “Dedicated to 
Free Communication Between 
Those on Earth and Those Be- 
yond.” 

Blaine entered the building and 
studied the directory. It gave floor 
and room numbers for Messages 
Incoming, Messages Outgoing, 
Translations, Abjurations, Exor- 
cisms, Offerings, Pleas, and Exhor- 
tations. He wasn’t sure which 
classification he fell under, or 
what the classifications signified, 
or even the purpose of the Spirit- 
ual Switchboard. He took his slip 
of paper to the information booth. 

“That’s Messages Incoming,” a 
pleasant, gray-haired receptionist 
told him. “Straight down the hall 
to Room 32A.” 

“Thank you.” Blaine hesitated, 
then asked, “Could you explain 
something to me?” 



108 



GALAXY 



“Certainly,” the woman said. 
“What do you wish to know?” 
“Well — I hope this doesn’t 
sound too foolish — what is all 
this?” 

The gray-haired woman smiled. 
“That’s a difficult question to an- 
swer. In a philosophical sense, I 
suppose you might call the Spirit- 
ual Switchboard a move toward a 
greater oneness, an attempt to dis- 
card the dualism of mind and body, 
and to substitute — ” 

“No,” Blaine said. “I mean liter- 
ally.” 

“Literally? Why, the Spiritual 
Switchboard is a privately en- 
dowed, tax-free organization, char- 
tered to act as a clearing house 
and center for communications to 
and from the Threshold Plane of 
the Hereafter. In some cases, of 
course, people don’t need our aid 
and can communicate directly with 
their departed ones. But more 
often, there is a need for amplifica- 
tion. This center possesses the 
proper equipment to make the de- 
ceased audible to our ears. And we 
perform other services, such as ab- 
jurations, exorcisms, exhortations 
and the like, which become neces- 
sary from time to time when flesh 
interacts with spirit.” 

She smiled warmly at him. 
“Does that make it any clearer?” 
“Oh, it does — yes, indeed,” 
Blaine said faintly, “and thank you 
very much,” and went down the 
hall to Room 32A. 



TT was a small gray room with 
several armchairs and a loud- 
speaker set in the wall. Blaine sat 
down, wondering what was going 
to happen. 

“Tom Blaine!” bawled a disem- 
bodied voice from the loudspeaker. 

“Huh? What?” Blaine asked, 
jumping to his feet and moving 
toward the door. 

“Tom! How are you, boy?” 
Blaine, his hand on the door- 
knob, suddenly recognized the 
voice. “Ray Melhill?” 

“Right! I’m up there where the 
rich folks go when they die! Pretty 
good, huh?” 

“I guess it is, if you say so,” 
Blaine answered uncertainly. “But, 
Ray, how? I thought you didn’t 
have any hereafter insurance.” 

“I didn’t. Let me tell you the 
whole story. They came for me 
maybe an hour after they took 
you. I was so damned angry, I 
thought I’d go out of my mind. I 
stayed angry right through the 
anesthetic, right through the wip- 
ing. I was still angry when I died.” 
“What was dying like?” Blaine 
asked. 

“It was like exploding. I could 
feel myself scattering all over the 
place, growing big as the Galaxy, 
bursting into fragments, and the 
fragments bursting into smaller 
fragments, and all of them were 
me, 

“And what happened?” 

“I don’t know. Maybe being so

angry helped. I was stretched as 
far as I could go — any further 
and it wouldn’t be me — and then 
I just simply came back together 
again. Some people do. Like I told 
you, a few out of every million 
have always survived without here- 
after training. I was one of the 
lucky ones.” 

“Lucky,” Blaine repeated bitter- 
ly. “I tried to do something for 
you, but you’d already been sold.” 
“I know,” Melhill said. “Thanks 
anyhow, Tom. And say, thanks for 
popping that slob. The one wear- 
ing my body.” 

“You saw that?” 

“I’ve been keeping my eyes 
open,” Melhill said. “By the way, 
I like that Marie. Nice-looking 
kid.” 

“Thanks. Ray, what’s the here- 
after like?” 

“I don’t know.” 

“You don’t?” 

“I’m not in the hereafter yet, 
Tom. I’m in the Threshold. It’s a 
preparatory stage, a sort of bridge 
between Earth and the hereafter. 
I wish I could explain. On Earth, I 
always wondered what the Thresh- 
old was like. No one could ever 
describe it. I suppose it bothers 
you.” 

“I’d like to know.” 

“Well, let me try. It’s a sort of 
grayness, with Earth on one side 
and the hereafter on the other. 
Only it’s not like that, because 
there aren’t any directions. I mean 



both Earth and the hereafter are 
on the same side, sort of, only — ” 
“Superimposed?” 

“No, not all all! Look, the here- 
after is a sort of grayness, but it’s 
all color, too. That’s the secret, 
really. I mean once you under- 
stand that color is direction and 
form is position — no. Let me put 
it this way. Sounds and colors are 
the same, we’ll start there. That’s 
why the form part is so important 
for understanding direction, which 
is actually position. Are you getting 
any of this?” 

“I’m afraid not,” Blaine said. “It 
sounds all mixed up.” 

»4T T’S perfectly clear to me,” 
Melhill said, “but explaining 
is like talking about the Taj Mahal 
to a man who’s been blind from 
birth. Only more so. Anyhow, let’s 
just say that Earth is on one side 
and the hereafter on the other, and 
drop it there.” 

“Why don’t you cross over?” 
Blaine asked. 

“Not yet,” Melhill said. “It’s a 
one-way street into the hereafter. 
Once you cross over, you can’t 
come back. There’s no more con- 
tact with Earth.” 

Blaine thought about that for a 
moment. “Then when are you 
going to cross over, Ray?” 

“I don’t rightly know. I thought 
I’d stay in Threshold for a while 
and keep an eye on things.” 

“Keep an eye on me, you mean.”

GALAXY 



“Well . 

“Thanks a lot, Ray, but don’t 
< do it. Go into the hereafter. I can 
take care of myself.” 

“Sure you can,” Melhill said. 
“But I think I’ll stick around for 
a while anyhow. You’d do it for 
me, wouldn’t you? So don’t argue. 
Now look, I suppose you know 
you’re in trouble?” 

Blaine nodded. “You mean the 
zombie?” 

“For one, yes. I dop’t know who 
he is or what he wants from you, 
Tom, but it can’t be good. You’d 
better be a long way off when he 
finds out. But that wasn’t the 
trouble I meant.” 

“You mean I have more?” 
“Afraid so. You’re going to be 
haunted, Tom.” 

In spite of himself, Blaine 
laughed. 

“What’s so funny?” Melhill de- 
manded indignantly. “You think 
it’s a joke to be haunted?” 

“I suppose not. But is it really 
■SO serious?” 

“Lord, you’re ignorant,” Melhill 
s.'iid. “Do you know anything about 
gliosts? How they’re made and 
wli.-it they want?” 

"Tell me.” 

"Well, there are three possibili- 
ties when a man dies. First, his 
mind can just explode, scatter, dis- 
sip.'ite; and that’s the end of him. 
Second, his mind can hold together 
through the death trauma; and he 
finds himself in the Threshold, a 



spirit. I guess you know about 
those two.” 

“Go on,” said Blaine. 

“The third possibility is this: 
His mind breaks during the death 
trauma, but not enough to cause 
dissipation. He pulls through into 
the Threshold. But the strain has 
been permanently disabling. He’s 
insane. And that, my friend, is 
how a ghost is born.” 

“Hmm,” Blaine said. “So a ghost 
is a mind that went insane during 
the death trauma?” 

“Right. He’s insane, and he 
haimts.” 

“But why?” 

“Ghosts haunt,” Melhill said, 
“because they’re filled with twisted 
hatred, anger, fear and pain. They 
won’t go into the hereafter. They 
want to spend as much time as 
they can on Earth, where their 
attention is still fixed. They want 
to frighten people, hurt them, drive 
them insane. Haunting is the most 
asocial thing they can do; it’s their 
madness. Look, Tom, since the 
beginning of mankind . .” 

CINCE the beginning of man- 
kind, there have been ghosts, 
but their numbers have always 
been small. Only a few out of 
every million people managed to 
survive after death; and only a 
tiny percentage of those survivors 
went insane during the transition, 
and became ghosts. 

But the impact of those few was 



TIME KILLER 



111 




colossal upon a mankind fascinated 
by death, awed by the cold un- 
caring immobility of the corpse 
so recently quick and vital, shocked 
at the ghastly inapropos humor of 
the skeleton. Death’s elaborate, 
mysterious figure seemed infinitely 
meaningful, its warning finger 
pointed toward the spirit-laden 
skies. 

So for every genuine ghost, ru- 
mor and fear produced a thousand. 



Every gibbering bat became a 
ghost. Marsh-fires, flapping cur- 
tains and swaying trees became 
ghosts, and St. Elmo’s fire, great- 
eyed owls, rats in the walls, foxes 
in the bush, all became ghostly 
evidence. Folklore grew and pro- 
duced witch and warlock, evil 
little familiars, demons and devils, 
succubi and incubi, werewolf and 
vampire. For every ghost, a thou- 
sand were suspected; and for every 



112 



GALAXY 





supernatural fact, a million were 
assumed. 

ICarly scientific invesigators en- 
teied this maze, trying to discover 
tile truth about supernatural phe- 
iKimena. They uncovered countless 
frauds, liallucinations and errors of 
jiKh'.inent. And they found a few 
geuuiiioly inexplicable events, 
whi( li, though interesting, were 
statistically insignificant. 

The whole tradition of folklore 



came tumbling down. Statistically, 
there were no ghosts. But contin- 
ually there was a sly, elusive some- 
thing which refused to stand still 
and be classified. It was ignored 
for centuries, the occasional some- 
thing which gave a basis and a 
reality to tales of incubi and suc- 
cubi. Until at last scientific theory 
caught up with folklore, made a 
place for it in the realm of indis- 
putable phenomena. 



TIME KILLER

VITITH the discovery of the 
scientific hereafter, the irra- 
tional ghost became understand- 
able as a demented mind inhabit- 
ing the misty interface between 
Earth and the hereafter. The forms 
of ghostly madness could be cate- 
gorized like madness on Earth. 

There were the melancholics, 
drifting disconsolately through the 
scenes of their great passion; the 
whispering hebephrenics, chatter- 
ing gay and random nonsense; the 
idiots and imbeciles who returned 
in the guise of little children; the 
schizophrenics who imagined them- 
selves to be animals, prototypes of 
vampire and Abominable Snow- 
man, werewolf, weretiger, werefox, 
weredog. 

There were the destructive stone- 
throwing and fire-setting ghosts, 
the poltergeists, and the grandilo- 
quent paranoids who imagined 
themselves to be Lucifer or Beel- 
zebub, Israfel or Azazael, the Spirit 
of Christmas Past, the Furies, 
Divine Justice, or even Death it- 
self. 

Haunting was madness. They 
wept by the old watch tower, these 
few ghosts upon whose gossamer 
shoulders rested the entire great 
structure of folklore, mingled with 
the mists around the gibbet, jab- 
bered their nonsense at the seance. 
They talked, cried, danced and 
sang for the delectation of the 
credulous, until scientific observers 
came with their sober cold ques- 



tions. Then they fled back to the 
Threshold, terrified of this on- 
slaught of reason, protective of 
their delusions, fearful of being 
cured. 

“So that’s how it was,” Melhill 
said. “You can figure out the rest. 
Since Hereafter, Inc., a hell of a 
lot more people are surviving after 
death. But, of course, a lot more 
are going insane on the way!” 
“Thus producing a lot more 
ghosts,” said Blaine. 

“Right, and one of them is after 
you,” Melhill said, his voice grow- 
ing faint. “So watch your step. 
Tom, I gotta go now.” 

“What kind of ghost is it?” 
Blaine asked. “Whose ghost? And 
why do you have to go?” 

“It takes energy to stay on 
Earth,” Melhill whispered. “I’m 
just about used up. Have to re- 
charge. Can you still hear me?” 
“Yes, go on.” 

“I don’t know when the ghost 
will show himself, Tom. And I 
don’t know who he is. I asked, but 
he wouldn’t tell me. Just watch 
out for him.” 

“I’ll watch out,” Blaine said, his 
ear pressed to the loudspeaker. 
“Ray! Will I speak to you again?” 
“I thipk so,” said Melhill, his 
voice barely audible. “Tom, I know 
you’re looking for a job. Try Ed 
Franchel, 322 West 19th Street. 
It’s rough stuff, but it pays. And 
watch yourself.” 

“Ray!” Blaine shouted.

There was no answer. The loud- 
speaker was silent, and he was 
alone in the gray room. 

12 . 

address Ray Melhill had 
given him was a small, dilapi- 
dated brownstone near the docks. 
Blaine climbed the steps and 
pressed the ground-floor buzzer 
marked Edward J. Franchel Enter- 
prises. The door was opened by a 
large, balding man in shirtsleeves. 

“Mr. Franchel?” Blaine inquired. 

“That’s me,” the balding man 
said, with a resolutely cheerful 
smile. “Right this way, sir.” 

He led Blaine into an apartment 
pungent with the odor of boiled 
cabbage. The front half of the 
apartment was arranged as an 
office, with a paper-cluttered desk, 
a dusty filing cabinet and several 
stiff-backed chairs. Past it, Blaine 
could see a gloomy living room. 
From the inner recesses of the 
apartment, a solido was blaring out 
a daytime show. 

“Please excuse the appearance,” 
Franchel said, motioning Blaine to 
a chair. “I’m moving into a regular 
office uptown just as soon as I 
lind time. The orders have been 
coming in so fast and furious . 
Now, sir, what can I do for you?” 

“I’m looking for a job,” said 
Blaine. 

“Hell,” .said Franchel, “I thought 
you were a customer.” He turned 



in the direction of the blaring so- 
lido and shouted, “Alice, will you 
turn that goddam thing down?” He 
waited until the volume had 
lowered somewhat, then turned 
back to Blaine. “Brother, if busi- 
ness doesn’t pick up soon, I’m 
going back to running a suicide 
booth at Coney. A job, huh?” 
“That’s right. Ray Melhill told 
me to try you.” 

Franchel’s expression bright- 
ened. “How’s Ray doing?” 

“He’s dead.” 

“Shame,” Franchel said. “He was 
a good lad, though always a bit 
wild. He worked for me a couple 
times when the space pilots were 
on strike. Want a drink?” 

Blaine nodded. Franchel went 
to the filing cabinet and removed a 
bottle of rye whisky labeled 
“Moonjuice.” He found two shot 
glasses and filled them with a 
practiced flourish. 

“Here’s to old Ray,” Franchel 
toasted. “I suppose he got himself 
boxed?” 

“Boxed and crated,” Blaine said. 
“I just spoke to him at the Spirit- 
ual Switchboard.” 

“Then he made Threshold!” 
Franchel exclaimed admiringly. 
“Friend, we should only have his 
luck. So you want a job? Well, 
maybe I can fix it. Stand up.”

muscles. He stood in front of 
Blaine, nodding to himself with 
downcast eyes, then feinted a quick 
blow at his face. Blaine’s right 
hand came up instantly, in time to 
block the punch. 

“Good build, good reflexes,” said 
Franchel. “I think you’ll do. Know 
anything about weapons?” 

“Not much,” Blaine said, won- 
dering what kind of job he was 
getting into. “Just — ah — antiques. 
Garands, Winchesters, Colts.” 

“No kidding! You know, I al- 
ways wanted to collect antique 
recoil arms. But no projectile or 
beam weapons are allowed on this 
hunt. What else you got?” 

“I can handle a rifle with bay- 
onet,” Blaine said, thinking how 
his basic-training sergeant would 
have roared at that overstatement. 

“You can? Lunges and parries 
and all? Well, I’ll be damned. I 
thought bayonetry was a lost art. 
You’re the first I’ve seen in fifteen 
years. Friend, you’re hired.” 

Franchel went to his desk, scrib- 
bled on a piece of paper and hand- 
ed it to Blaine. 

“You go to that address to- 
morrow for your briefing. You’ll 
be paid standard hunter’s salary, 
two hundred dollars plus fifty a 
day for every working day. Have 
you got your own weapons and 
equipment? Well, I’ll pick the stuff 
up for you, but it’s deducted from 
your pay. And I take ten per cent 
off the top. Agreeable?” 



“Sure,” Blaine said. “Could you 
explain a little more about the 
hunt?” 

“It’s just a standard hunt. But 
don’t go around talking about it. 
I’m not sure if hunts are still legal. 
I wish Congress would straighten 
out the Suicide and Permitted 
Murder Acts once and for all. A 
man doesn’t know where he’s at 
any more.” 

“Yeah,” Blaine agreed in some 
confusion. 

“They’ll probably discuss the 
legal aspects at the briefing,” Fran- 
chel said. “The other hunters will 
be there and the Quarry will tell 
you all you need to know. Say 
hello to Ray for me if you speak to 
him again. Tell him I’m sorry he 
got killed, but glad he made 
Threshold.” 

“I’ll tell him,” Blaine said. He 
decided not to ask any more ques- 
tions for fear his ignorance might 
cost him the job. Whatever hunt- 
ing involved, he and his body could 
surely handle it. And a job, any 
job, was as necessary now for his 
self-respect as for his dwindling 
wallet. 

He thanked Franchel and left. 

That evening, he ate dinner in 
an inexpensive diner and bought 
several magazines. He was elated 
at the knowledge of having found 
work, and sure that he was going 
to make a place for himself in this 
age. 

His high spirits were dampened

slightly when he glimpsed, on the 
way back to his hotel, a man 
standing in an alley watching him. 
The man had a white face and 
placid Buddha eyes, and his rough 
clothes hung on him like rags on 
a scarecrow. 

It was the zombie. 

Blaine hurried on to his hotel, 
refusing to anticipate trouble. After 
all, if a cat can look at a king, a 
zombie can look at a man, and 
where’s the harm? 

This reasoning didn’t prevent 
him from having nightmares until 
dawn. 

jC’ ARLY the next day, Blaine 
^ walked to 42nd Street and 
Park Avenue to catch a bus to the 
briefing. While waiting, he noticed 
a disturbance on the other side 
of 42nd Street. 

A man had stopped short in the 
middle of the busy pavement. He 
was laughing to himself and people 
were beginning to edge away from 
him. He was in his fifties, Blaine 
judged, dressed in quiet tweeds, 
bespectacled, a little overweight. 
He carried a small briefcase and 
looked undistinguishable from 
other businessmen. 

Abruptly he stopped laughing. 
He unzipped his briefcase and re- 
moved from it two long, slightly 
curved daggers. He flung the brief- 
case away and followed it with his 
glasses. 

“Berserker!” someone yelled. 



The man plunged into the crowd, 
both daggers flashing. People start- 
ed screaming and the crowd scat- 
tered before him. 

“Berserker, berserker!” 

“Call the flathats!” 

“Watch out! Berserker!” 

One man was down, clutching 
his torn shoulder and swearing. 
The berserker’s face was fiery red 
now and spittle drooled from his 
mouth. He waded deeper into the 
dense crowd; people knocked each 
other down in their efforts to es- 
cape. A woman shrieked as she 
was pushed off balance and her 
armload of parcels scattered across 
the pavement. 

The berserker swiped at her 
left-handed, missed, and plunged 
deeper into the crowd. 

Blue-uniformed police appeared, 
six or eight of them, sidearms out. 
“Everybody down!” they shouted. 
“Flatten! Everybody down!” 

All traffic had stopped. The 
people in the berserker’s path flung 
themselves to the pavement. On 
Blaine’s side of the street, people 
were also flattening against the 
pavement. 

A freckled girl of perhaps twelve 
tugged at Blaine’s arm. “Come on, 
mister, get down! You wanna get 
beamed?” 

Blaine lay down beside her. The 
berserker had turned and was run- 
ning back toward the policemen, 
screaming wordlessly and waving 
his knives. 



TIME KILLER

Three of the policemen fired at 
once, their weapons throwing a 
pale yellowish beam which flared 
red when it struck the berserker. 
He screamed as his clothing began 
to smolder, turned, and tried to 
escape. 

A BEAM took him square in the 
back. He flung both knives at 
the policemen and collapsed. 

An ambulance dropped down 
with whirring blades and quickly 
loaded the berserker and his vic- 
tims. The policemen began break- 
ing up the crowd that had gathered 
around them. 

“All right, folks, it’s all over 
now. Move along!” 

The crowd began to disperse. 
Blaine stood up and brushed him- 
self off. “What was that?” he 
asked. 

“It was a berserker, silly,” the 
freckled girl said. “Couldn’t you 
see?” 

“I saw. Do you have many?” 
She nodded proudly. “New York 
has more berserkers than any other 
city in the world except Manila, 
where they’re called amokers. But 
it’s all the same thing. We have 
maybe fifty a year.” 

“More,” a man said. “Maybe 
seventy, eighty a year. But this 
one didn’t do so good.” 

A small group had gathered 
near Blaine and the girl. They 
were discussing the berserker much 
as Blaine had heard strangers in 



his own time talk at the scene of 
an automobile accident. 

“How many did he get?” 

“Only five, and I don’t think 
he killed any of them.” 

“His heart wasn’t in it,” an old 
woman said. “Wlien I was a girl, 
you couldn’t stop them so easily.” 
“Well, he picked a bad spot,” 
commented the freckled girl. “This 
corner is crawling with flathats. A 
berserker can hardly get started 
before he’s beamed.” 

A big policeman came over. “All 
right, folks, break it up. The fun’s 
over, move along now.” 

The group dispersed. Blaine 
caught his bus, wondering why fifty 
or more people chose to berserk 
in New York every year. Sheer 
nervous tension? A demented form 
of individualism? Adult delin- 
quency? 

It was one more of the things 
he would have to find out about 
the world of 2110.

^T^HE address was a penthouse 
high above Park Avenue in 
the Seventies. A butler admitted 
him to a spacious room where 
chairs had been set up in a long 
row. The dozen men occupying 
the chairs were a loud, tough, 
weatherbeaten bunch, carelessly 
dressed and ill at ease in such rare- 
fied surroundings. Most of them 
knew each other.

“Hey, Otto! Back in the hunting 
game?” 

“Yah. No money.” 

“Knew you’d come back, old 
boy. Hi, Tim!” 

“Hi, Bjorn. This is my last 
hunt.” 

“Sure it is. Last till next time.” 
“No, I mean it. I’m buying a 
seed-pressure farm in the North 
Atlantic Abyss. I just need a 
stake.” 

“You’ll drink up your stake.” 
“Not this time.” 

“Hey, Theseus! How’s the throw- 
ing arm?” 

“Good enough, Chico. Que tal?” 
“Not too bad, kid.” 

“There’s Sammy Jones, always 
last in.” 

“I’m on time, ain’t I?” 

“Ten minutes late. Where’s your 
sidekick?” 

“Sligo? Dead. That Asturias 
hunt.” 

“Tough. Hereafter?” 

“Don’t know. Haven’t heard 
from him.” 

A man entered the room and 
called out, “Gentlemen, your at- 
tention, please!” 

He advanced to the center of 
the room and stood, hands on his 
hips, facing the row of hunters. He 
was a slender, sinewy man of 
medium height, dressed in riding 
breeches and an open-necked shirt. 
He had a small, carefully tended 
mustache and startling blue eyes 
in a thin, tanned face. For a few 



seconds, he looked the hunters 
over, while they coughed and shift- 
ed their feet uncomfortably. 

At last he said, “Good morning, 
gentlemen. I am Charles Hull, 
your employer and Quarry.” He 
gave them a smile of no warmth. 
“First, gentlemen, a word concern- 
ing the legality of our proceedings. 
There has been some recent con- 
fusion about this. My lawyer has 
looked into the matter fully and 
will explain. Mr. Jensen.” 

A SMALL, nervous-looking man 
came into the room, pressed 
his spectacles firmly against his 
nose and cleared his throat. 

“Yes, Mr. Hull. Gentlemen, as 
to the present legality of the hunt: 
In accordance with the revised 
statutes to the Suicide Act of 2 102, 
any man protected by Hereafter 
insurance has the right to select 
any death for himself, at any time 
and place, and by any means, as 
long as those means do not con- 
stitute cruel and unnatural abuse. 
The reason for this fundamental 
‘right to die’ is obvious : The courts 
do not recognize physical death as 
death per se, if said death does 
not involve the destruction of the 
mind. Providing the mind survive, 
the death of the body is of no 
more moment, legally, than the 
sloughing of a fingernail. The body, 
by the latest Supreme Court de- 
cision, is considered an appendage 
of the mind, its creature, to be dis- 



TIME KILLER 



119 



posed of as the mind directs.” 

During this explanation, Hull 
had been pacing the room with 
quick, catlike steps. He stopped 
now and said, “Thank you, Mr. 
Jensen. So there is no questioning 
my right to choose my time and 
way of dying. Nor is there any 
illegality in my selecting one or 
more persons such as yourselves 
to perform the act for me. And 
your own actions are considered 
legal under the Permitted Murder 
section of the Suicide Act. All well 
and good. The only legal question 
arises in a recent appendage to the 
Suicide Act.” 

He nodded to Mr. Jensen. 

“The appendage states,” Jensen 
said, “that a man can select any 
death for himself, at any time and 
place, by any means, etcetera, so 
long as that death is not physically 
injurious to others." 

“That,” said Hull, “is the trouble- 
some clause. Now a hunt is a legal 
form of suicide. A time and place 
are arranged. You, the hunters, 
chase me. I, the Quarry, flee. You 
catch me, kill me. Fine! Except for 
one thing.” 

He turned to the lawyer. “Mr. 
Jensen, you may leave the room. I 
do not wish to implicate you.” 

After the lawyer had left, Hull 
said, “The one problem remaining 
is, of course, the fact that I will 
be armed and trying my very best 
to kill you. Any of you. All of you. 
And that is illegal.” 



Hull sank gracefully into a 
chair. “The crime, however, is 
mine, not yours. I have employed 
you to kill me. You have no idea 
that I plan to protect myself, to 
retaliate. That is a legal fiction, 
but one which will save you from 
becoming possible accesories to 
the fact. If I am caught trying to 
kill one of you, the penalty will 
be severe. But I will not be caught. 
One of you will kill me, thus 
putting me beyond the reach of 
human justice. If I should be so 
unfortunate as to kill all of you, 
I shall complete my suicide in the 
old-fashioned manner, with poison. 
But that would be a disappoint- 
ment to me. I trust you will not 
be so clumsy Ss to let that hap- 
pen. Any questions?” 

' I ^HE hunters were murmuring 
-*■ among themselves: 

“Slick fancy-talking bastard.” 
“Forget it. All Quarries talk like 
that.” 

“Thinks he’s better than us, him 
and his classy legal talk.” 

“We’ll see how good he talks 
with a bit of steel through him.” 
Hull smiled coldly. “Excellent. 
I believe the situation is clear. 
Now, if you please, tell me what 
your weapons are.” 

One by one, the hunters an- 
swered : 

“Mace.” 

“Net and trident.” 

“Spear.” 



120

“Morning-star.” 

“Bola.” 

“Scimitar.” 

“Bayonet rifle,” Blaine said 
when his turn came. 

“Broadsword.” 

“Battle-axe.” 

“Saber.” 

“Thank you, gentlemen,” Hull 
said. “I will be armed with a 
rapier, naturally, and no armor. 
Our meeting will take place Sun- 
day, at dawn, on my estate. The 
butler will give each of you a 
paper containing full instructions 
on how to get there. Let the bay- 
onet man remain. Good morning 
to the rest of you.” 

The hunters left. Hull said, 
“Bayonetry is an unusual art. 
Where did you learn it?” 

Blaine hesitated, then said, “In 
the Army, 1943 to 1945.” 

“You’re from the past?” 

Blaine nodded. 

“Interesting,” Hull said, with 
no particular sign of interest. 
“Then this, I daresay, is your first 
hunt?” 

“It is.” 

“You appear a person of some 
intelligence. I suppose you have 
your reasons for choosing so haz- 
ardous and disreputable an em- 
ployment?” 

“I’m low on funds,” Blaine said, 
“and I can’t find anything else to 
do.” 

“Of course,” said Hull, as though 
he had known it all along. “So 



you turned to hunting. Yet hunt- 
ing is not a thing merely to turn 
to; and hunting the beast Man is 
not for everyone. The trade calls 
for certain special abilities, not the 
least of which is the ability to 
kill. Do you think you have that 
innate talent?” 

“I believe so,” Blaine said, 
though he hadn’t considered the 
question until now. 

“I wonder,” Hull mused. “In 
spite of your bellicose appearance, 
you don’t seem the type. What if 
you find yourself incapable of kill- 
ing me? What if you hesitate at 
the crucial moment when steel 
grates on steel?” 

“I’ll chance it,” Blaine said. 

TTULL nodded agreeably. “And 
so will I. Perhaps, hidden 
deep within you, a spark of mur- 
der burns. Perhaps not. This doubt 
will add spice to the game— though 
you may not have time to savor 
it.” 

“That’s my worry,” Blaine said, 
feeling an intense dislike for his 
elegant and rhetorical employer. 
“Might I ask you a question?” 
“Consider me at your service.” 
“Thank you. Why do you wish 
to die?” 

Hull stared at him, then burst 
into laughter. “Now I know you’re 
from the past! What a question!” 
“Can you answer it?” 

“Of course,” Hull said. He 
leaned back in his chair, and his 



TIME KILLER 



121 



eyes took on the distant look of 
a man dictating his memoirs. “I 
am forty-three years old and weary 
of nights and days. I am a wealthy 
man and an uninhibited one. I 
have experimented, contrived, 
laughed, wept, loved, hated, tasted 
and drunk — my fill. I have sam- 
pled all that Earth and elsewhere 
have to offer me, and I choose not 
to tediopsly repeat the experience. 
When I was young, I pictured this 
excellent green planet revolving 
mysteriously around its flamboy- 
ant yellow luminary as a treasure 
trove, a brass box of delights in- 
exhaustible in content and im- 
measurable in their effect upon 
my ever-eager desires. 

“But now, sadly, I have lived 
longer and have witnessed sensa- 
tion’s end. And now I see with 
what obese complacency our fat 
round Earth circles, at servile dis- 
tance and unvarying pace, its 
gaudy, dreaded star. And the 
imagined treasure chest of the 
Earth seems now a child’s painted 
toy box, shallow in its contents 
and mediocre in its effect upon 
nerves too quickly deadened to all 
delight.” 

Hull glanced at Blaine to note 
the effect of his words, and then 
went on. 

“Boredom stretches before me 
now like a vast, arid plain — and 
I choose not to be bored. I choose, 
instead, to move on, move forward, 
move out, to sample Earth’s last 



and greatest adventure — the ad- 
venture of Death, gateway to the 
afterlife. Can you understand 
that?” 

“Certainly,” Blaine said, irri- 
tated yet impressed by Hull’s 
theatricals. “But what’s the hurry? 
Life might have some good things 
still in store for you. And death 
is inevitable. Why rush it?” 

“Spoken like a true 20th cen- 
tury optimist,” said Hull, laugh- 
ing. “ ‘Life is real, life is earnest . .’ 
In your day, one had to believe 
that life was real and earnest. 
What alternative was there? How 
many of you really believed in a 
life after death?” 

“That doesn’t alter the validity 
of my point,” Blaine argued, hating 
the stodgy, cautious, reasonable 
position he was forced to assume. 

“But it does! The perspective on 
life and death has changed now. 
Instead of Longfellow’s prosy ad- 
vice, we follow Nietzsche’s dictum 
— to die at the right time! Intelli- 
gent people don’t clutch at the last 
shreds of life like drowning men 
clinging to a bit of board. They 
know th^t the body’s life is only 
an infinitesimal portion of Man’s 
total existence. Why shouldn’t 
they speed the body’s passing by 
a few years, if they so desire? 
Why shouldn’t those bright pupils 
skip a grade or two of school? 
Only the frightened, the stupid, the 
uneducated grasp at every possible 
monotonous second on Earth.” 



122 



GALAXY 



“The frightened, stupid and un- 
educated,” Blaine repeated. “And 
the unfortunates who can’t afford 
Hereafter insurance.” 

f ? V^^EALTH and class have 
’ ’ their privileges,” Hull said, 
smiling faintly, “and their obliga- 
tions as well. One of those obliga- 
tions is the necessity of dying at 
the right time, before one becomes 
a bore to one’s peers and a horror 
to oneself. But the deed of dying 
transcends class and breeding. It 
is every man’s patent of nobility, 
his summons from the king, his 
knightly adventure, the greatest 
deed of his life. And how he ac- 
quits himself in that lonely and 
perilous enterprise is his true 
measure as a man.” 

Hull’s blue eyes were fierce and 
glittering. He said, “I do not choose 
to experience this crucial event in 
bed. I do not wish a dull, tame, 
commonplace death to sneak over 
me disguised as sleep. I choose to 
die fighting!” 

Blaine nodded in spite of him- 
self and felt regret at his own pro- 
saic death. A car accident! How 
dull, tame, commonplace! And 
how strange, dark, atavistic and 
noble seemed Hull’s lordly selec- 
tion of death. Pretentious, of 
course, but then life itself was a 
pretension in the vast universe of 
unliving matter. Hull was like an 
ancient Japanese nobleman calmly 
kneeling to perform the cere- 



monial act of hara-kiri, and em- 
phasizing the importance of life 
in the very selection of death. But 
hara-kiri was a passive Eastern 
avowal, while Hull’s manner of 
dying was a Western death, fierce, 
violent, exultant. 

It was admirable. But intense- 
ly irritating to a man not yet pre- 
pared to die. 

Blaine said, “I have nothing 
against you or any other man 
choosing his own death. But what 
about the hunters you plan to 
kill? They haven’t chosen to die 
and they have no assurance they’ll 
survive in the hereafter.” 

Hull shrugged his shoulders. 
“They choose to live dangerous- 
ly. In Nietzsche’s phrase, they pre- 
fer to run risk and danger, and 
play dice with death. Blaine, have 
you changed your mind?” 

“No.” 

Then we will meet Sunday.” 
Blaine went to the door and 
took his paper of instructions from 
the butler. As he was leaving, he 
said, “I wonder if you’ve consid- 
ered one last thing.” 

“What is that?” Hull asked. 
“You must have thought of it,” 
Blaine said. “The possibility that 
this whole elaborate setup — the 
scientific hereafter, voices of the 
dead, ghosts — is merely a gigan- 
tic hoax, a money-making fraud 
perpetrated by Hereafter, Inc.” 
Hull stood perfectly still. When 
he spoke, there was a hint of anger 



TIME KILLER 



123 



in his voice. “That is quite impos- 
sible. Only a very uneducated man 
could think such a thing.” 

“Maybe,” Blaine said. “But 
wouldn’t you look silly if it were 
a hoax! Good morning, Mr. Hull.” 
He left, glad to have shaken up 
that smooth, fancy, rhetorical 
smugness even for a moment— and 
sad that his own death had been 
so dull, tame and commonplace. 

14 . 

' I ■'HE following day, Saturday, 
Blaine went to Franchel’s 
apartment for his rifle, bayonet, 
hunter’s uniform and pack. He was 
given half his salary in advance, 
less ten per cent and the cost of 
the equipment. The money was 
very welcome, for he had been 
down to three dollars and change. 

He went to the Spiritual Switch- 
board, but Melhill had left no 
further messages for him. He re- 
turned to his hotel room and spent 
the afternoon practicing lunges 
and parries. 

That evening, Blaine found him- 
self tense and despondent, nervous 
at the thought of the hunt begin- 
ning in the morning. He went to a 
small West Side cocktail lounge 
that had been designed to re- 
semble a 20th century bar, with a 
dark gleaming bar, wooden stools, 
booths, a brass rail, and sawdust 
on the floor. He slid into a booth 
and ordered beer. 



The classic neon lights glowed 
softly and a genuine antique juke- 
box played the sentimental tunes 
of Glenn Miller and Benny Good- 
man. Blaine sat hunched over his 
glass of beer, drearily asking him- 
self who and what he was. 

Was it truly he taking casual 
employment as a hunter and killer 
of men? 

Then what happened to Tom 
Blaine, the former designer of sail- 
boats, former listener to high-fidel- 
ity music, former reader of choice 
books, former viewer of good 
plays? What happened to that 
quiet, sardonic, non-aggressive 
man? 

Surely that man, housed in his 
slender, nervous, unassuming body, 
would never choose to kill! 

Would he? 

Was that familiar and mourned 
Blaine defeated and smothered by 
the large, square-muscled, quick- 
reflexed fighter’s body he had ac- 
quired? And was that body, with 
its own peculiar glandular secre- 
tions dripping into the dark blood- 
stream, its own distinct and con- 
figurated brain, its own system of 
nerves and signals and responses— 
was that domineering body respon- 
sible for everything, dragging its 
helpless owner into murderous vio- 
lence? 

Blaine rubbed his eyes and told 
himself that he was dreaming non- 
sense. The truth was simply this: 
He had died through circum- 



124 



GALAXY 



stances beyond his control, been 
reborn in the future, and found 
himself unemployable except as a 
hunter. Q.E.D. 

But that rational explanation 
didn’t satisfy him and he had no 
time to search out the slippery and 
elusive truth. 

He was no longer a detached 
observer of 2110. He had become 
a biased participant, an actor in- 
stead of an onlooker, with all of 
an actor’s thoughtless sweep and 
rush. Action was irresistible; it 
generated its own momentary 
truth. The brakes were off and the 
engine Blaine was rolling down 
the steep hill Life, gathering mo- 
mentum but no moss. Perhaps this, 
now, was his last chance for a 
look, a summing up, a measured 
choice . 

But it was already too late, for 
a man slid into the booth opposite 
him like a shadow across the 
world. And Blaine was looking 
into the white and impassive face 
of the zombie. 

OOD evening,” said the 
zombie. 

“Good evening,” Blaine said 
steadily. “Would you care for a 
drink?” 

“No, thank you. My system 
doesn’t respond to stimulation.” 

“Sorry to hear it,” said Blaine. 

The zombie shrugged his shoul- 
ders. “I have a name now,” he 
said. “I decided to call myself 



Smith, until I remember my 
real name. Smith. Do you like it?” 
“It’s a fine name.” 

“Thank you. I went to a doc- 
tor,” Smith said. “He told me my 
body’s no good. No stamina, no 
recuperative powers.” 

“Can’t you be helped?” 

Smith shook his head. “The 
body’s definitely zombie. I occu- 
pied it much too late. The doctor 
gives me another few months at 
most.” 

“Too bad,” said Blaine, feeling 
nausea rise in his throat at the 
sight of that thick-featured, leaden- 
skinned face with its unharmoni- 
ous features and patient Buddha’s 
eyes. 

Smith sat slack and unnatural 
in rough workman’s clothes, his 
black-dotted white face close- 
shaven and smelling of strong lo- 
tion. But he had changed. Already 
Blaine could see a certain leathery 
dryness in the once-pliant skin, 
certain striations in the flesh 
around the eyes, nose and mouth, 
minute creases in the forehead like 
toolmarks in old leather. And, 
mingled with the heavy after-shav- 
ing lotion, Blaine thought he could 
sense the first faint odor of dis- 
solution. 

“What do you want with me?” 
Blaine asked. 

“I don’t know.” 

“Then leave me alone.” 

“I can’t do that,” Smith said 
apologetically. 



TIME KILLER

“Do you want to kill me?” 
Blaine persisted, his throat dry. 

“I don’t know! I can’t remem- 
ber! Kill you, protect you, maim 
you, love you — I don’t know yet! 
But I’ll remember soon, Blaine, 
I promise!” 

“Leave me alone,” warned 
Blaine, his muscles tensing. 

“I can’t,” Smith said. “Don’t 
you understand? I know nothing 
except you. Literally nothing! I 
don’t know this world or any 
other, no person, face, mind or 
memory. You’re my only land- 
mark, the center of my existence, 
my only reason for living.” 

“Stop it!” 

“But it’s true! Do you think I 
enjoy dragging this tattered flesh 
through the streets? What good is 
life with no hope before me and 
no memory behind me? Death is 
better! Life means filthy decaying 
flesh, and death is pure spirit! I’ve 
thought about it, dreamed about 
it, beautiful fleshless death! But 
one thing stops me. I have you, 
Blaine, to keep me going!” 

“Get out of here,” Blaine said, 
nausea bitter in his mouth. 

“You, my sun and moon, my 
stars, my Earth, my total uni- 
verse, my life, my reason, my 
friend, enemy, lover, murderer, 
wife, father, child, husband—” 
Blaine’s fist shot out, striking 
Smith high on the cheekbone. The 
zombie was flung back in the 
booth. His expression did not 



change, but a great purple bruise 
appeared on his lead-colored 
cheekbone. 

“Your mark!” Smith said. 

Blaine’s fist, poised for another 
blow, dropped. 

Smith stood up. “I’m going. 
Take care of yourself, Blaine. 
Don’t die yet! I need you. Soon 
I’ll remember, and I’ll come to 
you.” 

Smith, his slack, bruised face 
impassive, left the bar. 

Blaine ordered a double whisky 
and sat for a long time over it, 
trying to still the shaking in his 
hands. 

15 . 

T1 LAINE arrived at the Hull es- 
tate by rural jetbus, an hour 
before dawn. He was dressed in 
a traditional hunter’s uniform — 
khaki shirt and slacks, rubber- 
soled shoes and wide-brimmed hat. 
Slung over one shoulder was his 
field pack; over the other, he car- 
ried his rifle and bayonet in a 
plastic bag. 

A servant met him at the outer 
gate and led him to the low, ram- 
bling mansion. Blaine learned that 
the Hull estate consisted of nine- 
ty wooded acres in the Adiron- 
dack Mountains between Keene 
and Elizabethtown. 

Here, the servant told him, 
Hull’s father had died at the age 
of fifty-one, taking the lives of 



126 



GALAXY 



six hunters with him before a saber 
man slashed his head off. Glorious 
death! Hull’s uncle, on the other 
hand, had chosen to berserk in 
San Francisco, a city he had al- 
ways loved. The police had to 
beam him twelve times before he 
dropped, and he took seven by- 
standers with him. The news- 
papers made much of the exploit 
and accounts of it were preserved 
in the family scrapbook. 

It just went to show, the gar- 
rulous old retainer pointed out, 
the difference in temperaments. 
Some, like the uncle, were friend- 
ly, fun-loving men who wanted to 
die in a crowd, attracting an en- 
viable amount of attention. Others, 
like the present Mr. Hull, were 
more given to the love of soli- 
tude and nature. 

Blaine nodded politely to all 
this and was taken to a large rustic 
room where the hunters were as- 
sembled, drinking coffee and hon- 
ing a last razor edge to their 
weapons. Light flashed from the 
blued-steel broadsword and sil- 
very battle-axe, wavered along the 
polished spearhead and glinted 
frostily from the diamond points 
of the mace and morning-star. At 
first glance, Blaine thought it 
looked like a scene from medieval 
times. But on second thought he 
decided it was more like a movie 
set. 

“Pull up a chair, pal,” the axe- 
man called. “Welcome to the 



Benevolent Protective Society of 
Butchers, Slaughterhouse Men, 
and Killers-at-Large. I’m Sammy 
Jones, finest axeman in the Amer- 
icas and probably Europe, too.” 
Blaine sat down and was 'intro- 
duced to the other hunters. They 
represented half a dozen nationali- 
ties, although English was their 
common tongue. 

S AMMY Jones was a squat, 
black-haired, bull-shouldered 
man, dressed in patched and faded 
khakis, with several old hunting 
scars across his craggy, thick- 
browed face. 

“First hunt?” he asked, glanc- 
ing at Blaine’s neat pressed 
khakis. 

Blaine nodded, removed his 
rifle from its plastic bag and 
fitted the bayonet to its end. He 
tested the locking mechanism, 
tightened the rifle’s strap, and re- 
moved the bayonet again. 

“Can you really use that thing?” 
Jones queried interestedly. 

“Sure,” Blaine said, more con- 
fidently than he felt. 

“Hope so. Guys like Hull have 
a nose for the weak sisters. They 
try to cut ’em out of the pack 
early.” 

“How long does a hunt usually 
last?” Blaine asked. 

“Well,” Jones said, “longest I 
was ever on took eight days. That 
was Asturias, where my partner 
Sligo got his. Generally a good 



TIME KILLER

pack can pin down a Quarry in 
a day or two. Depends on how 
he wants to die. Some try to hang 
on as long as they can. They run 
to cover. They hide in caves and 
ravines, the dirty treacherous dogs, 
and you have to go in for them 
and chance a thrust from the dark. 
That’s how Sligo got it. But I 
don’t think Hull’s that way. He 
wants to die like a great big fire- 
eating he-man hero. So he’ll stalk 
around and take chances, looking 
to see how many of us he can 
knock off with his pigsticker.” 
“You sound as if you don’t ap- 
prove,” Blaine said. 

Sammy Jones raised his bushy 
eyebrows. “I don’t hold with mak- 
ing a big fuss about dying. Here 
comes the hero himself.” 

Hull entered the room, lean and 
elegant in khaki-colored silk, with 
a white silk bandanna knotted 
loosely around his neck. He car- 
ried a light pack, and strapped to 
one shoulder was a thin, wicked- 
looking rapier. 

“Good morning, gentlemen,” he 
said. “Weapons all sharpened, 
packs on straight, shoelaces firmly 
tied? Excellent!” 

Hull walked to a window and 
drew the curtains aside. 

“Behold the first crack of dawn, 
a glorious streak in our eastern 
skies, harbinger of our fierce Lord 
Sun who rules the chase. I shall 
leave now. A servant will inform 
you when my half-hour grace is 



done. Then you may pursue and 
kill me upon sight — if you are 
able! The estate is fenced. I will 
remain within its confines and so 
shall you.” 

Hull bowed, then walked quick- 
ly and gracefully out of the room. 

“God, I hate these fancy birds!” 
Sammy Jones raved, after the door 
was closed. “They’re all alike, 
every one of them. Acting so 
cool and casual, so goddam heroic. 
If they only knew how bloody 
silly I think they are — me that’s 
been on hunts for twenty-eight 
lousy years.” 

“Why do you hunt? Blaine 
asked. 

J ONES shrugged. “My father 
was an axeman and he taught 
me the business. It’s the only one 
I know.” 

“You could learn a different 
trade,” Blaine said. 

“I suppose I could. The fact is 
I like killing these aristocratic gen- 
tlemen. I hate every rich snob 
among them with their country 
club hereafter that a poor man 
can’t afford. I take pleasure in 
killing them, and if I had money, 
I’d pay for the privilege.” 

“And Hull enjoys killing poor 
men like you,” Blaine said. “It’s 
a sad world.” 

“No, just an honest one,” Sam- 
my Jones told him. “Stand up. I’ll 
fasten your pack on right.” 

When that was done, Sammy

Jones said, “Look, Tom, why don’t 
you and me stick together on this 
hunt? Mutual protection, like?” 

“My protection, you mean,” 
Blaine said. 

“Nothing to be ashamed of. 
Every skilled trade must be 
learned before it can be practiced. 
And what better man to learn 
from than myself, the finest of 
the fine?” 

“Thanks,” said Blaine grateful- 
ly. “I’ll try to hold up my end, 
Sammy.” 

“You’ll do great. Now Hull’s a 
fencer, be sure of it, and fencers 
have their little tricks which I’ll 
explain as we go along. When 
he-” 

At that moment, a servant en- 
tered, carrying an old, ornate 
chronometer. When the second 
hand passed twelve, he looked 
sharply at the hunters. 

“Gentlemen,” he said, “the time 
of grace is passed. The chase may 
begin.” 

The hunters trooped outside 
into the gray, misty dawn. Theseus 
the tracker, balancing his trident 
across his shoulders, picked up the 
trail at once. It led upward, toward 
a mist-wreathed mountain. 

Spread out in a long single file, 
the hunters started up the moun- 
tain’s side. 

Soon the early morning sun 
had burned away the mists. 
Theseus lost the trail when it 
crossed bare granite. The hunters 



spread out in a broken line across 
the face of the mountain and con- 
tinued advancing slowly and warily 
upward. 

At noon, the broadsword man 
picked a fragment of khaki-col- 
ored silk from a thornbush. A few 
minutes later, Theseus found foot- 
prints on moss. They led down 
Into a narrow, thickly wooded val- 
ley. Eagerly the hunters pressed 
forward. 

“Here he is!” a man shouted. 

Blaine whirled and saw, fifty 
yards to his right, the man with 
the morning-star running forward. 
He was the youngest of the hun- 
ters, a brawny, self-confident Si- 
cilian. His weapon consisted of a 
stout handle of ash, fixed to which 
was a foot of chain. At the end 
of the chain was a heavy spiked 
ball, the morning-star. He was 
whirling this weapon over his head 
and singing at the top of his lungs. 

J ONES and Blaine sprinted 
toward him. They saw Hull 
break from the bushes, rapier in 
hand. The Sicilian leaped for- 
ward and swung a blow that could 
have felled a tree. Hull dodged 
lightly out of the way and lunged. 

The morning-star man gurgled 
and went down, pierced through 
the throat. Hull planted a foot on 
his chest, yanked the rapier free, 
and vanisl;ied again into the un- 
derbrush. 

“I never could understand why

a man’d use a morning-star,” Sam- 
my Jones said. “Too clumsy. If 
you don’t hit your man the first 
lick, you never recover in time.” 

The Sicilian was dead. Hull’s 
passage through the underbrush 
was clearly visible. They plunged 
in after him, followed by most of 
the hunters, with flankers ranged 
on either side. 

Soon they encountered rock 
again and the trail was lost. 

All afternoon they searched, 
with no luck. At sundown, they 
pitched camp on the mountain- 
side, posted guards, and discussed 
the day’s hunting over a small 
campfire. 

“Where do you suppose he is?” 
Blaine asked. 

“He could be anywhere on the 
damned estate,” Jones said. “Re- 
member, he knows every foot of 
ground here. We’re seeing it for 
the first time.” 

“Then he could hide from us 
indefinitely.” 

“If he wanted to. But he wants 
to be killed, remember? In a big, 
flashy, heroic way. So he’ll keep 
on trying to cut us down until we 
get him.” 

Blaine looked over his shoul- 
der at the dark woods. “He could 
be standing there now, listening.” 

“No doubt he is,” Jones said. 
“I hope the guards stay awake.” 

Conversation droned on in the 
little camp and the fire burned 
low. Blaine wished morning would 



come. Darkness reversed the roles. 
The hunters were the hunted now, 
stalked by a cruel and amoral sui- 
cide intent upon taking as many 
lives with him as possible. 

With that thought, Blaine un- 
easily dozed off. 

Sometime before dawn, he 
was awakened by a scream. 
Grabbing his rifle, he sprang to 
his feet and peered into the dark- 
ness. There was another scream, 
closer this time, and the sound 
of hurried movement through the 
woods. Then someone threw a 
handful of leaves on the dying 
fire. 

In the sudden yellow glow, 
Blaine saw a man staggering back 
to the camp. It was one of the 
guards, trailing his spear behind 
him. He was bleeding in two 
places, but his wounds didn’t ap- 
pear fatal. 

“That bastard,” the spearman 
sobbed, “that sneaky bastard.” 

“Take it easy, Chico,” one of 
the men said, ripping open the 
spearman’s shirt to clean and 
bandage the wound. “Did you 
get him?” 

“He was too quick,” the spear- 
man moaned. “I missed.” 

That was the end of sleeping 
for the night. 

The hunters began moving 
again at the first light of dawn, 
widely scattered, looking for a 
trace of the Quarry. Theseus found 



132 



GALAXY 



a broken button and then a half- 
erased footprint. The hunt veered, 
winding up a narrow-faced moun- 
tain. 

At the head of the pack, Otto 
gave a sudden yell. “Hey! Here! 
I got him!” 

Theseus rushed toward him, 
followed by Blaine and Jones. 
They saw Hull backing away, 
watching intently as Otto ad- 
vanced, swinging the bola around 
his cropped head. The Argentinian 
lasso hissed in the air, its three 
iron balls blurring. Then Otto re- 
leased it. Instantly Hull flung him- 
self to the ground. The bola 
snaked through the air inches 
above his head, wrapped itself 
around a tree limb and snapped it 
off. Hull, grinning broadly, ran 
toward the weaponless man. 

Before he could reach him, 
Theseus had arrived, flourishing 
his trident. They exchanged 
thrusts. Then Hull whirled and 
ran. 

Theseus lunged. The Quarry 
howled with pain but continued 
running. 

“Did you get him?” Jones asked. 

“A flesh wound in the rump,” 
Theseus said. “Probably just pain- 
ful to his pride.” 

The hunters ran on, panting 
heavily, up the mountain’s side. 
But they had lost the Quarry 
again. 

They spread out, surrounding 
the narrowing mountain, and slow- 



ly began working their way to- 
ward the peak. Occasional noises 
and footprints told them the Quar- 
ry was still before them, retreat- 
ing upward. As the peak narrowed, 
they were able to close their ranks 
more, lessening any chance of 
Hull slipping through. 

"IJ Y late afternoon, the pine and 
spruce trees had become 
sparse. Above them was a con- 
fused labyrinth of granite boul- 
ders, and past that the final peak 
itself. 

“Careful now!” Jones called to 
the hunters. 

As he said it, Hull launched an 
attack. Springing from behind a 
rack pinnacle, he came at old 
Bjorn the mace man, his rapier 
hissing, trying to cut the man down 
quickly and escape the throttling 
noose of hunters. 

But Bjorn gave ground only 
slowly, cautiously parrying the 
rapier thrusts, both hands on his 
mace as though it were a quar- 
terstaff. Hull swore angrily at the 
phlegmatic man, attacked furious- 
ly, and threw himself aside just 
in time to avoid a blow of the 
mace. 

Old Bjorn closed — too rapidly. 
The rapier darted in and out of 
his chest like a snake’s flickering 
tongue. Bjorn’s mace dropped and 
his body began rolling down the 
mountainside. 

But the hunters had closed the 



TIME KILLER 



133 



circle again. Hull retreated up- 
ward, into a maze of boulders. 

The hunters pressed forward. 
Blaine noticed that the sun was 
almost down; already there was a 
twilight hue to the air, and long 
shadows stretched across the gray 
rocks. 

“Getting toward evening,” he 
panted to Jones. 

“Maybe half an hour more 
light,” Jones said, squinting at the 
sky. “We better get him soon. 
After dark, he could pick every 
man of us off from this rock.” ' 

They moved more quickly now, 
searching among the high boul- 
ders. 

“He could roll rocks down on 
us,” Blaine said nervously. 

“Not him,” Jones grunted. “He’s 
too damn proud.” 

And then Hull stepped from 
behind a high rock near Blaine. 

“All right, rifleman,” he chal- 
lenged. 

Blaine, his rifle at high port, 
just managed to parry the thrust. 
The blade of the rapier rasped 
along the gun barrel, past his neck. 
Automatically he deflected it. 
Something drove him to roar as 
he lunged, to follow the lunge 
with an eager disemboweling slash 
and then a hopeful butt stroke in- 
tended to scatter his enemy’s 
brains across the rocks. For that 
moment, Blaine was no longer a 
civilized man operating under a 
painful necessity; he was a prey- 



ing creature joyously pursuing his 
true vocation of murder. 

The Quarry avoided his blows 
with quick sullen grace. Blaine 
stumbled after him, anger sapping 
his skill. Suddenly he was shoved 
aside by Sammy Jones. 

“Mine,” Jones said. “All mine. 
I’m your boy, Hull. Try me with 
the pigsticker.” 

H ull, his face expressionless, 
advanced, his rapier flashing. 
Jones stood firm on slightly bowed 
legs, the battle-axe turning light- 
ly in his hands. Hull feinted and 
lunged. Jones parried so hard that 
sparks flew, and the rapier bent 
like a green stick. 

The other hunters had come 
up now. They chose seats on near- 
by rocks and caught their wind, 
commenting on the duel and shout- 
ing advice. 

“Pin him against the cliff, 
Sammy!” 

“No, over the edge with him!” 
“Want some help?” 

“Hell, no!” Jones shouted back. 
“Watch out he don’t nip a fin- 
ger. Sammy.” 

“Don’t worry,” Jones said. 
Blaine watched, his rage ebbing 
as quickly as it had come. He had 
assumed that a battle-axe would 
be a clumsy weapon requiring a 
full backswing for each stroke. 
But Sammy Jones handled the 
short, heavy axe as though it were 
a baton. He took no backswing 



134 



GALAXY 



but let drive from any position, 
recovering instantly, his implac- 
able weight and drive forcing Hull 
toward the cliffs sheer edge. 

There was no real comparison 
between the two men, Blaine 
realized. Hull was a gifted ama- 
teur, a dilettante murderer; Jones 
was a seasoned killer. It was like 
matching a ferocious house dog 
against a jungle tiger. 

The end came quickly in the 
blue twilight of the mountaintop. 
Sammy Jones parried a thrust 
and stamped forward, swinging his 
axe backhanded. The blade bit 
deep into Hull’s left side. Hull 
fell screaming down the moun- 
tain’s side. For seconds afterward, 
they heard his body crash and 
turn. 

“Mark where he lies,” Sammy 
Jones said. 

“He’s gotta be dead,” said the 
saber man. 

“He probably is. But it isn’t a 
workmanlike job unless we make 
sure.” 

On the way down, they found 
Hull’s mangled and lifeless body. 
They marked the location for the 
burial party and walked on to the 
estate. 

16. 

^ I ^HE hunters returned to the 
-*■ city in a group and threw a 
wild celebration. During the even- 
ing, Sammy Jones asked Blaine 



if he would join him on the next 
job. 

“I’ve got a nice deal lined up 
in Omsk,” Jones said. “A Russian 
nobleman wants to hold a couple 
of gladiatorial games. You’d have 
to use a spear, but it’s the same 
as a rifle. I’d train you on the way. 
After Omsk, there’s a really big 
hunt being organized in Manila. 
Five brothers aim to shove off to- 
gether. They want fifty hunters to 
cut them down. What do you say?” 

Blaine thought carefully before 
answering. The hunter’s life was 
the most compatible he had found 
so far in this world. He liked the 
rough companionship of men like 
Sammy Jones, the straight, simple 
thinking, the life outdoors, the ac- 
tion that erased all doubts. 

On the other hand, there was 
something terribly pointless about 
wandering around the world as a 
paid killer, a modern and ap- 
proved version of the bully, the 
bravo, the thug. There was some- 
thing futile about action just for 
action’s sake, with no genuine in- 
tent or purpose behind it, no reso- 
lution or discovery. These consid- 
erations might not arise if he were 
truly what his body seemed; but 
he was not. The hiatus existed and 
had to be faced. 

And, finally, there were other 
problems that this world pre- 
sented, other challenges more fit- 
ting to his personality. And those 
had to be met. 



TIME KILLER

“Sorry, Sammy,” he said. 

Jones shook his head. “You’re 
making a mistake, Tom. You’re 
a natural-born killer. There’s noth- 
ing else for you.” 

“Perhaps not,” Blaine admitted. 
“I have to find out for sure, 
though.” 

“Well, good luck,” Sammy 
Jones said. “And take care of that 
body of yours. You picked a good 
one.” 

Blaine blinked involuntarily. “Is 
it so obvious?” 

Jones grinned. “I been around, 
Tom. I can tell when a man is 
wearing a host. If your mind had 
been born in that body, you’d be 
away and hunting with me. And 
if your mind had been born in a 
different body—” 

“Yes?” 

“You wouldn’t have gone hunt- 
ing in the first place. It’s a tricky 
splice, Tom. You’d better figure 
out which way you’re going.” 

“Thanks,” Blaine said. They 
shook hands and Blaine left for his 
hotel. 

TTE reached his room and flung 
himself, fully dressed, upon 
the bed. When he awoke, he would 
call Marie. But first he had to 
sleep. All plans, thoughts, prob- 
lems, decisions, even dreams, 
would have to wait. He was tired 
down to the very bone. 

He snapped off the lights. With- 
in seconds, he was asleep. 



Several hours later, he awoke 
with a sensation of something 
wrong. The room was dark. Every- 
thing was still, more silent and 
expectant than New York had any 
right to be. 

He sat upright in bed and heard 
a faint movement on the other 
side of the room, near the wash- 
basin. 

Blaine reached out and snapped 
on the light. There was no one in 
the room. But as he watched, his 
enameled washbasin rose in the 
air. Slowly it lifted, hovering im- 
possibly without support. And at 
the same time he heard a thin shat- 
tering laugh. 

He knew at once that he was 
being haunted, and by a polter- 
geist. 

Carefully he eased out of bed 
and moved toward the door. The 
suspended basin dipped suddenly 
and plunged toward his head. He 
ducked and the basin shattered 
against the wall. 

His water pitcher levitated now, 
followed by two heavy tumblers. 
Twisting and turning erratically, 
they edged toward him. 

Blaine picked up a pillow as a 
shield and rushed to the door. He 
turned the lock as a tumbler shat- 
tered above his head. The door 
wouldn’t open. The poltergeist was 
holding it shut. 

The pitcher struck him violent- 
ly in the ribs. The remaining tum- 
bler swung in an ominous circle 



136 



GALAXY 



around his head and he was forced 
to retreat from the door. 

He remembered the fire escape 
outside his window. But the pol- 
tergeist thought of it as he started 
to move. The curtains suddenly 
burst into flame. At the same in- 
stant, the pillow he was holding 
caught fire, and Blaine threw if 
from him. 

“Help!” he shouted. “Help!” 



He was being forced into a cor- 
ner of the room. With a rumble, 
the bed slid forward, blocking his 
retreat. A chair rose into the air 
and poised itself for a blow at his 
head. 

And continually there was a 
thin and shattering laughter that 
Blaine unnervingly could almost 
recogni2e.

FORECAST 

At this writing, only the first installment of TIME KILLER by Robert 
Sheckley has appeared, yet so vigorously fresh is its basic concept and so 
daringly imaginative its future society and written with such ingenuity and 
power that the story is already being ranked with The Demolished Man, 
Gravy Planet, The Puppet Masters and other great Galaxy serials. As you 
can see from the second installment, the story does not pause to catch its 
breath; it gains momentum with each chapter until — well, next month, 
hunted by the living and haunted by the dead, Blaine has to do a lot better 
than merely look alive to stay alive in this fantastic world where life after 
death is a scientific reality — for those who can take it with them! 

Scheduling a novella with an installment of a serial is generally just 
not done; it means packing too much into an issue. But you know us by now, 
not satisfied with anything less than shooting the works, going for broke, 
and other such expressions of editorial daredeviltry. So you'll be reading 
JOIN NOW by Finn O'Donnevan next month and discovering just why it 
is that Crompton has made the most chancy possible mind bet — winning 
it means he literally has to collect himself on two crazy worlds! 

A novelet if there's room, short stories for sure . 

And Willy Ley's startling revelation of THE STRANGE PLANET NEXT 
DOOR that we are busy sending explorers to right now, this very minute! 
The immense wealth they are finding can make the dire predictions of 
Malthusians hang fire for still more centuries, perhaps millenia. A.nd as for 
its incredible natives — many of them just have no business being alive! 

As you can see, it's not on issue to miss.

shortened “tin canister” to “tin can” 
—and the battle rages on between 
English “tin” and American “can.” 
Both are equally right or equally 
wrong, for a can is a barbarized 
canister and a tin is 99%% steel, 
with only a molecular protective 
coating of tin — now, of course, 
deposited by electrolysis instead of 
the medieval dip — or no tin at all. 

Not horsepower but muscle 
made the early 19th century tin 
cans. Tin-plated sheet iron was cut 
into can bodies by hand- or foot-

operated shears and bent around a 
cylindrical mold by a brawny tin- 
smith. More muscles and shears 
cut out round tops and bottom and 
forced the pieces together.Then the 
tinsmith’s assistant applied hot 
solder along the side seams and 
end sections. A cap hole was left 
in the top through which food to 
be canned could be forced, and a 
small plug was soldered into place. 
Sixty canisters a day was the maxi- 
mum output for even an expert 
smith. 

Later in the century, a hand 



press was used to shape the can 
bodies, boosting production to 100 
cans per day per man. But the rest 
of the process remained the same. 

Today, high-speed machinery, 
which produces up to 500 cans 
a minute, has made canned food 
inexpensive and the supermarket 
possible. Ninety-five per cent of 
our salmon, 75 per cent of our 
total tomato crop, and 50 per cent 
of such fruits and pears and 
peaches are canned by 3,500 can- 
neries, who get their containers 
from 48 can manufacturers.

¥> ORN in a revolution, the tin 
can was forced to maturity by 
wars. Both Blue and Gray were 
fed from cans in the field during 
the Civil War, but that was only 
a token of what was to come; the 
American GI of World War II ate 
out of cans, fought with ammu- 
nition from hermetically sealed 
cans, was nursed with canned 
blood plasma, produced dense 
smoke screens from a can, re- 
paired his jeep with canned mon- 
key wrenches, and drove canned 
motorcycles dropped from the sky 
by parachute. 



At sea, meanwhile, the U.S. 
Navy urgently needed canned 
water for its life rafts, for 
men survived storms and sea bat- 
tles only to be destroyed by thirst 
and salt-water sickness. It was a 
tricky technical problem for the 
can manufacturers; trace minerals 
made canned water undrinkable, 
and a heat-resistant germ in water 
— bacillius welchii — often caused 
disabling dysentery. Canned water 
also had a metallic taste, and in 
freezing weather, the expanding 
ice broke open the strongest can 
made. 



THE TIN AGE 



141 



Researchers solved the problem 
by using distilled water complete- 
ly free of minerals and bacteria, 
then putting it in a metal can lined 
with a temperature-resistant wax 
that kept the water potable both 
in the steaming Pacific and fro 2 en 
Arctic. The cans were constructed 
with extra strong seams and with 
a small vacuum at the top into 
which any ice could safely expand. 

Distilled water, however, while 
drinkable, is hardly tasty stuff, and 
the war-born can has been im- 
proved until it can be filled with 
ordinary tap water. It is now stock- 
piled by many Civil Defense units 
throughout the country. 

That bit of inge^iious problem- 
solving is a direct descendant of 
the research into raw materials 
and techniques that is the real 
story of the tin can. One such re- 
searcher, Gail Borden, for whom 
one of the largest dairy firms in 
the world is named, produced a 
canned product that has saved the 
lives of countless thousands of in- 
fants in the past century. 

In the early 1850s, Borden was 
returning to the U.S. from Eng- 
land, where he had been awarded 
the London World’s Fair Gold 
Medal for his canned “meat bis- 
quit,” which he had supplied to 
California Gold Rush pioneers, to 
Arctic explorers such as Sir Ed- 
ward Belcher, and later to Florence 
Nightingale, to help feed her 
wounded soldiers in the Crimea. 



Noticing that babies of seasick im- 
migrants in steerage were suffer- 
ing from lack of milk, he realized 
the plight of mothers who could 
not nurse their own children. 

Borden spent all his money and 
time for over a year in a Brooklyn 
cellar lab, much of the while pen- 
niless. His boiled-off milk concen- 
trate tasted terrible and looked 
worse. “Something in the air con- 
taminates it,” he noted in his care- 
ful records. But he found the secret 
one day while watching members 
of a Shaker community preserving 
fruit by first boiling it in a “vacu- 
um pan.” His condensed milk is 
still used for infants where pas- 
teurized milk is not available, and 
evaporated milk is yet another out- 
growth of his findings. 

M any products need similar 
scientific coaxing to fit them 
comfortably into tin cans. The 
beer can, for instance, now holds 
16 per cent of industry produc- 
tion, but it almost didn’t come 
about at all Beer is so allergic to 
tin that even infinitesimal amounts 
of it turn the clearest beer cloudy. 
The answer was a protective 
enamel, but beer stayed in bottles 
a good many years until research- 
ers found the right one. Now “tin” 
cans is even more of a misnomer, 
for those enamels and others are 
coating ever more of the new cans, 
making them wholly tinless. 

Size, shape, construction, con-

tents, function — the tin can is 
ceaselessly changing these attri- 
butes in a revolutionary evolu- 
tionary rush. Lithography on metal 
—impossible, but not any more; 
it’s as bright and colorful as any- 
thing printed on pap>er. Aluminum 
cans— can’t be done, but it is, shiny 
and rustproof and much lighter 
than steel, with a future as promis- 
' ing as Durand’s “tin canister” 
Ife, ; proved to be a century and a half 
ago. 

Of all the innovations, the most 
intriguing is the pushbutton aero- 
sol can, which sprays out every- 
thing from whipped cream to a 
golfball refinisher. “People love 
them,” says William J. Milton, 
president of the Can Manufactu- 
rers Association. “By 1960, we’ll 
be using them at the rate of a bil- 
lion a year.” 

Still another war-baby can de- 
velopment, aerosols came about 
when the U.S. Army asked the 
Department of Agriculture to de- 
velop an insecticide dispenser that 
GIs could use against the malaria- 
carrying mosquito in the Pacific 
Theater during World War II. 
The result was the famed “bug 
bomb,” a heavy welded steel con- 
tainer holding the insecticide and 
a propellant — Freon gas liquified 
under pressure — which forced out 
the mosquito killer at the touch of 
a button. 

For all their popularity among 
the troops, aerosols were nothing 



to bet on after the war; a con- 
tainer able to hold the 70 pounds 
of pressure required has to be 
more of a grenade than a tin can. 
Back to the lab went the bug 
bomb, and there it stayed until 
the answer was foimd — a mix- 
ture of Freon-12 and Freon-11. 
The new propellant needed only 
half the pressure, which meant 
that lightweight containers were 
possible, in turn making possible 
all manner of mistified products, 
with more and more on the way. 

A ND now comes Freon C-318 
from Du Pont, at present imder 
test. If successful, C-3 18, along with 
compressed hydrogen, will create 
a whole new sub-section in food 
stores — aerosol -dispensed sand- 
wich spreads, syrups, sauces and 
frostings, just as a modest begin- 
ning. 

It’s literally true that people will 
buy anything in a pushbutton can, 
even air — Liquid Glaze, Inc., sells 
cans of compressed gas called Spair 
that can inflate a tire of 22 pounds 
in six seconds. 

With the U. S. Government own- 
ing the aerosol patent and licensing 
all comers either free or the next 
thing to it, small businessmen are 
crowding into the aerosol game 
right alongside industrial giants. 
Making a good thing of it, too, for 
we’re just skimming the froth off 
a deep lake of products that can 
be aerosold. 



THE TIN AGE 



143 



In medicine — burn ointments, 
disinfectants, decontaminants, ex- 
act dosages in a hurry during an 
angina attack, when speed counts: 
the patient simply puts the tube in 
his mouth and pushes the button. 

Home, farm and factory — there 
now are area deodorants, fire ex- 
tinguishers, run stoppers for stock- 
ings, beehive smoke, dye for mark- 
ing animals that have been 
vaccinated, which can also no 
doubt be used for crates and cases. 

If there is any limit to what can 
be put into an aerosol can, we’re 
not even remotely in sight of it. 
Like many of our modern frontiers, 
this one is not rawly, blatantly visi- 
ble, but it’s a Gold Rush all the 
same. 

W HAT’S ahead in the tin can? 

Like the aerosol, which could- 
n’t have been foreseen even weeks 
before it happened, the more star- 
tling future developments remain 
either unguessable or laboratory 
secrets, not to be announced until 
they are perfected. But some are 
on the horizon. 

Another wartime innovation, the 
hotcan, will soon be ready for mar- 
keting. Merely puncture the hot- 
can, actually one can within an- 
other, and add water, and you’ve 
started a chemical reaction that 



speedily heats the contents. 

Tinless now, but opaque, cans 
can be made of transparent plas- 
tics to display their wares as at- 
tractively as glass jars do now, 
and without fragility. 

Aluminum and magnesium cans 
are lighter, but a pound of mer- 
chandise still weighs a pound — a 
fact that researchers are bound to 
challenge, if they aren’t already 
doing so. 

And the self-propagating can- 
one can to spray out another 
around all the ungainly or scatter- 
some, perishable or storageable— 
tables and diamond dust, electric 
bulbs and tropic-fresh bananas, 
tanks and cadavers, archeological 
finds and the air of other worlds. 

Cans within cans, cans atop 
cans, cans that look like cans, cans 
that look like nothing under the 
sun, cans to enclose anything ex- 
cept service and even that may 
somehow come about some day. 

What the film industry says of 
a movie when the last scene is 
shot, we may say of the future: 
“It’s in the can.” A figure of 
speech, of course, but hyperbolical- 
ly true. The breakthroughs in 
packaging make no headlines. 
They merely make civilization a 
fact.
