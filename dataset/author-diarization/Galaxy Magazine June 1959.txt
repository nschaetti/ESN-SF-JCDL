W E make many more adjust- 
ments to civilization than psy- 
chologists are willing to credit us 
with. Few of us, for example, pause 
long enough to be dismayed by 
this dismaying fact — mail : incom- 
ing always exceeds mail ; outgoing. 

That’s so even in mailing houses, 
two of my correspondents (more 
incoming) inform me, unless the 
mailing houses bring in new busi- 
ness. If they let it slack a moment, 
the mailman delivers circulars, 
promotion letters, begging letters, 
coupons, free samples and other 
foreign matter from rival concerns. 

Mailing houses and mail-order 
houses are not to be confused with 
each other, as if, having adjusted 
so well, you needed to be told. 

Mail-order houses sell merchan- 
dise by direct mail from their own 
mailing departments. Nobody has 
to do a thing for them. 

Mailing houses mail mail for 
firms that do not have all the 
frightening equipment needed to 
fold, stuff, address, lick envelopes, 
stick on stamps and push into mail- 



boxes the often millions of pieces ’ 
of persuasion that the clients of 
mailing houses hire mailing houses 
to mail for them. Nobody does 
anything for mailing houses except 
pay them. 

Mail is mentioned frequently 
in science fiction. Whether fast or 
slow, it generally resembles today’s 
postal systems, with only an occa- 
sional extrapolation based on WW 
II’s microfilmed V-mail. V-mail 
never was popular, was avoided 
whenever possible during the war 
—who wants his mail open to in- 
spection, even when it isn’t in- 
spected? Judging by mail’s negli- 
gible evolution, there may be as 
close a similarity between present 
and future fwstal practices as writ- 
ers suggest. The single big differ- 
ence is in means of transportation. 

Air mail from England to Italy f 
takes only a day or two. But sur- 
face mail can wander around for 
a month or more before arriving— K 
whereas two letters that Julius ’ 
Caesar wrote to Cicero from Eng- 
land reached Rome in 26 and 28

days respectively. Not bad, eh? 

At that time, courier mail was 
for the government only. But it 
was no more than a couple of hun- 
dred years later, in the third cen- 
tury, that Emperor Dibcletian set 
up a postal system for citizens. 

Pohl and Kornbluth, in their bril- 
liant Galaxy serial Gravy Planet, 
had everything from the armed 
services to the post office run by 
free enterprise. This struck a num- 
ber of people as satire. Either they 
forgot or never knew of mercen- 
aries, both on an individual and 
army scale, and the privately oper- 
ated postal systems of the past. 
Not only did the free-enterprise 
mails exist all over Europe but in 
Boston, in 1639, Richard Fair- 
banks’ house was the collection 
point for all inbound and outgoing 
sea mail, on which he was allowed 
a penny per letter. 

Things were very much other- 
wise in Virginia, where a postal 
service was established in 1657— 
with all planters required by law 
to send mail on to the next plan- 
tations, at their own expense — 
and a fine of a hogshead of tobac- 
co for failure to comply. 

Science fiction writers see out- 
world mail as unprecedentedly ex- 
pensive. But in the 18th century, 
both in England and the Colonies, 
letters cost eight cents for 15 miles 
or less, and up to 25 cents for 
up to 300 miles — equal, in pur- 
chasing power, to a lot of meals. 



As with all enterprises, deterior- 
ation of mail service is easier to 
achieve than improvement. From 
seven deliveries a day to the busi- 
ness districts and four to homes, 
which is really too many, the rate 
has been slashed to two and one, 
which is really too few. 

On the other hand. New York 
City recently revolutionized its 
postal system, no doubt at the 
usual cost of revolutions — heads 
rolling, blood flowing, the mighty 
toppling from their thrones. What- 
ever secret plotting and split-sec- 
ond execution were required, the 
gain was worth it: 

For generations, letters ad- 
dressed across the street (a com- 
mon urban practice in paying 
bills) had to travel clear to the 
central post office in the middle of 
the city and then be sent back 
again, which, according to a signed 
confession by the postmaster, 
sometimes took as long as four 
days. New interception points, or 
some such term, have been estab- 
lished midway, so that mail now 
has only half as far to go to get 
back where it started from. 
Progress of this sort is much harder 
to make than you might imagine. 

Those of us who have never 
collected stamps, a minority that 
must be protected by law if it is 
not to become extinct, are mild- 
ly amused to find that postage 
stamps are not much over a cen- 
tury old. The first stamp was is-

sued in England in 1840, and five 
years later in the U.S. — but by 
the postmasters of New York, Bal- 
timore, St. Louis, Providence and 
New Haven. They proved pop- 
ular, so Washington went into the 
business, though on a modest two- 
denomination scale; only since one 
or another administration of 
F.D.R., a notorious stamp-hoarder, 
has the government expanded 
operations to compete with small 
countries which get much of their 
revenue from philatelists. 

Dedicated non-philatelists have 
been known to shop from one post 
office to another, hunting for fam- 
iliar old stamps. New issues con- 
fuse and upset them as much as 
constantly changed shapes and 
colors and designs of paper money 
would bother philatelists. Maybe 
that’s an unwise comment — a 
future numismatic President may 
be reading these words, and the 
country will be using sampler and 
pinup and commemorative bills in 
rustic and shocking and mourning 
hues. 

Lucky thing mail-order and 
mailing houses weren’t around in 
1847 with high-pressure lobbies. 
That was the year all mail was 
ordered prepaid; before that, pre- 
payment was optional. If the bill 
had been defeated, we would now 
be handing out cash — which was 
how postage was collected until 
stamps came into being — for our 
share of the several pounds of pro- 



motional material per annum 
dumped on each capita in every 
modern country. 

Civilization could not exist with- 
out postal services, it should not 
have to be stated here. Obvious 
reasons aside, I am thankful for 
the mails because it brought Fig. 1

What Strange 
Cosmic Power 
Influences Humans ? 

By W HAT Right does man presume that he is the chosen being 
of the universe and that the earth alone shapes his existence? In 
the infinite spaces above, tenanted by vast and magnificent worlds, 
are Cosmic forces which influence the life of every mortal. As iron 
filings respond to the attraction of a magnet, so too, your acts are the 
result of an impelling influence upon your will. Just as the unseen 
Cosmic rays give the earth form and substance, so too from the infinite 
reaches, an invisible subtle energy affects the thought processes of every 
human. Life itself bows to this strange universal force — why, then, 
should YOU not understand and COMMAND IT? You are like a 
pendulum either to be swung forward to happiness and the fulfillment 
of your dreams, or backward into discouragement and disillusionment. 
Why remain poised in a state of anxiety, uncertainty, and anticipation? 
Learn to draw to yourself these Cosmic forces which will give your 
mind the creative impetus that will assure the end in life you seek. 



For You — A Gift Copy of th* Sealed Book 

Not for the curious nor the skeptical, but for the modern man and 
woman the Rosicrucians, a progressive movement of thinking persons, 
offer a free. Sealed Book, telling how you may acquire the truth 
about these phenomenal Cosmic powers little understood today and 
which make for freedom and attainment in life. This is the

T here were fifty-eight of 
them on the trailer. Fifty- 
eight of them, and they 
had been together for a long time. 
But fifty-five didn’t count. Only 
three counted, three who stood at 
the center of it. Hibsen was one of 
the ones that counted, Hibsen with 
the diamond epaulettes and the 
rope of matched rubies. And 
Brabant counted, Brabant and his 
blots of ink. And there was Rae 
Wensley. She may have counted 
the most. 

But the others didn’t count, 
however much they suffered. It 
was only those three. 

One of the ones who didn’t 
count was screaming. He was the 
littlest of them, very small and 
very new. Off at the outer shell 
of the trailer, where the scout 
rocket was getting ready to go, 
Brabant could hear him scream. 
Hibsen, hauling himself along a 
corridor with squidlike boimds, 
could hear him very well, and Rae 
could hear him even better, be- 
ing closer. The littlest of them 
screamed because he was in agony. 
It was a very great pain — the 
greatest he had ever experienced 
in his life — except, perhaps, the 
great pain that had begun it, in the 
act of being born five weeks and 
three days before.

sterile and empty because there 
was no need for bassinets where 
they were, and slapped at a wall 
switch. 

“Mary!” she called urgently. 

In a moment, there was a sleepy 
“M-m-m?” from the grille over the 
switch. 

“Better come and help me, 
Mary,” said Rae Wensley, and left 
the switch open while she went 
back to tending the baby. Mary 
was the baby’s mother; the baby’s 
screams would bring her faster 
than anything Rae could say over 
the intercom. 

They had been going on for 
nearly an hour. 

Rae, her hair net brushed askew 
and her golden hair beginning to 
creep out, found herself pleading 
with the baby as she slapped it, 
patted it, squeezed its back. “Come 
on, honey. Please! Get the bubble 
up for Rachel.” 

She held the child away from 
her searchingly; the senseless little 
face screwed up its eyes the 
tighter, and the long, hairless little 
head wobbled the more wildly on 
its gelatine neck. If they hadn’t 
been in free-fall, she couldn’t have 
done that, for the tiny new muscles 
could not have held the head. But 
if they hadn’t been in free-fall, 
the little swallowing apparatus 
could have rid itself of the bubble 
of gas that brought the pain — if 
gravity had been there to help it. 
But there wasn’t any gravity, not 



with the trailer in orbit. It was a 
perfectly normal baby — and a 
perfectly normal bubble of gas; 
it was only the situation that 
wasn’t normal. 

That was Rae Wensley. She 
was nineteen years old and had 
been in space for seven years. 

A ND then there was Computer- 
man Hibsen. Hibsen was no 
colonist — no, not he! Hibsen shut 
his ears to the screams from the 
nursery, though it was getting 
closer and the screams were get- 
ting louder. Computerman Hibsen 
was all gold and gems: fine gold 
traceries festooned his blue silk 
jacket; his buttons were great pink 
pearls; blue diamonds winked 
from his fingers. He flashed and 
glowed in the light from the tube- 
lamps recessed in the corridor 
walls as he propelled himself by 
handholds; and he also sang: 
“Three little spacemen 
Lived on Aleph Four — 

Along came the Gormen, 

And they were seen no more!” 
It was not a popular song with 
the rest of the crew and the colon- 
ists, but Hibsen himself was not 
popular. He didn’t think that was 
odd. He was used to it. 

He had applied for crew status 
on Explorer II out of defiance and 
anger, because a girl had told him 
he could never pass. Interstellar 
flight demanded more than tech- 
nical skill. Hibsen had that, of 



12

course. But it also demanded — 
well, it demanded the qualities 
that were required of each person 
in a group of some fifty-odd who 
would be confined for more than 
seven years in a space about the 
size of a three-story apartment 
house. 

Nobody would have guessed 
that Hibsen would pass, least of 
all Hibsen. It was a shock to him 
when Brabant, the psychologist, 
accepted him. 

Hibsen reacted, as most of the 
fifty-odd candidates had, by draw- 
ing his salary for the eighteen-year 
voyage in advance, and spending 
it. For Hibsen, the money went 
into gold and gems, and every last 
bit of that went into all of the 
uniforms he took along. 

He flaunted the jewel-studded 
uniforms for every day of those 
seven years, until the joke would 
have worn thin even to him — if 
it had been a joke. It wasn’t. It 
was what he had always wanted, 
and now that he had it, he was 
satisfied: the tangible proof that 
he was a success. 

^^HE baby was now purple. It 
was the free-fall, beyond 
doubt. Colic? On Earth it would 
have been called colic, so perhaps 
that was the right name. 

There’s an old prescription for 
colicky babies: Take one thick, 
soundproof door; close it upon the 
child. 



That was a pretty good joke, 
Rae thought distractedly. There 
weren’t enough walls in the whole 
trailer to shut out the soimd of 
one screaming child. And where 
was Mary? 

She forced herself to put the 
baby down. To do that, she at- 
tached dog-leash snaps to the lit- 
tle harness that held the baby’s 
diaper; the leashes were fastened 
to the walls, and they would keep 
him from drifting helplessly into 
something. She left him hanging 
like Mohammed between earth 
and sky, and kicked herself to the 
corridor. 

And there was Mary coming — 
and far behind her, just turning in 
from a lateral traverse, Hibsen. 

“Mary, thank heaven!” Rae 
stopped the other woman with 
one hand and the two of them 
clung at the door of the nursery, 
looking inside. Rae’s heart was 
wrung by every gasping cry. “The 
poor thing! He’s been like this for 
an hour!” 

“I know.” Mary Marne stared 
in at her baby, writhing and kick- 
ing his lean, ruddy little legs. She 
said rebelliously: “If the baby and 
I could go along, this wouldn’t 
happen any more. It isn’t fair, Rae! 
I had everything all set up. There 
was plenty of room for us in the 
rocket until Dr. Brabant pushed 
in. We could all go together down 
to Four, and the baby would have 
decent gravity, and—”

She stopped short, because the 
screams stopped short. 

There was a strangling noise 
from the baby. He kicked and 
jerked with all his arms and legs 
at once. A blob of whitish-yellow 
frothy liquid appeared at his 
mouth; it broke into globules and 
clung to his face as he tried to 
inhale. 

“He’s spitting up!” Rachel 
Wensley was a few inches the 
closer. She leaped in first, caught 
at the harness straps and un- 
snapped the child. Mary was be- 
side her at once, trying to help. 

This was, again, a perfectly 
normal phenomenon. Babies with 
bubbles of gas in their digestive 
tracts need to get rid of the gas, 
because it’s painful. Eventually 
they manage to expel it. Some- 
times the gas comes up alone, 
sometimes it brings an ounce or 
so of milk with it. This is perfect- 
ly normal — in a normal environ- 
ment. 

But without gravity to clutch 
the milk down and away from the 
untutored little mouth, it becomes 
abnormal, and unless the breath- 
ing passages are promptly cleared, 
it becomes, in fact, fatal. 

T N the corridor outside, Hib- 
sen, a few yards away, heard 
the screams change to odd choking 
and bubbling noises. He caught 
himself by a handhold and lis- 
tened, swinging like a helium bal- 



loon on a string. Then he scram- 
bled down the lateral corridor and 
gaped in at the nursery door. 

There was Rachel Wensley, her 
blonde hair floating about her 
head like weeds under water, 
braced with both legs and one arm 
against a changing table. Her free 
hand had a grip on Mary Marne’s 
belt, and she appeared to be try- 
ing to swing the other woman 
around her head. Mary in turn 
was holding the baby with both 
hands, one clutching his middle, 
the other supporting his forehead. 
The baby himself, flailing around 
like the tip of a whip, was choking 
and gasping — and, in a moment, 
screaming again. Centrifugal force 
had flung the choking fluids out 
of his little mouth and cleared the 
breathing passages, which had 
been the idea. 

Mary gasped, triumphant and 
relieved: “That does it, Rae! Let 
go!” 

The acrobatic group broke up, 
and the two women consulted over 
the baby. His screams dwindled 
and became grunts, then some- 
thing resembling small snores. His 
mother held him at her shoulder, 
patting him gently. 

Rae automatically took a spare 
hair net out of her pocket and be- 
gan to fix her hair. “Hi,” she said 
breathlessly as she noticed Hibsen 
staring in. 

He came cautiously in, trying 
to shield his pearly-gold finery 



14 



GALAXY 



from the small floating drops of 
spit-up formula. “What a mess. 
Everything all right?” 

“It is now.” Rae helped the 
baby’s mother snap him back into 
the floating harness arrangement 
again. He was sound asleep. “Well, 
he got it up. But I hate this.” 

“You asked for it,” chortled 
Computerman Hibsen, and he 
added: “Colonist!” 

And colonist was what Rachel 
Wensley was. So were the Marnes. 
So were forty-one of the trailer’s 
complement, and they were the 
whole reason for the trip. 

For seven years, the round steel 
ball that was Explorer II’s tractor 
had spat faint quick streams of 
electrons backward from its mag- 
netic throats, and for all of those 
years it had looked like a child’s 
tinker-toy, jammed together any- 
old-fashion. 

It was an ugly spectacle of a 
ship. There was the tractor sphere 
itself, with its flaring blunderbuss 
exhausts. There were the long 
parallel strands of steel cable that 
linked tractor to trailer. Finally 
there was the trailer, shaped more 
or less like a can of soup, but 
with lumps and cobwebby masses 
of wire projecting from it at odd 
angles in odd places. 

There were, for example, the 
two shuttle rockets. In flight, they 
were a part of the trailer’s living 
space, though they were attached 
to it in the ungainly fashion of a 



child’s doll carried by one heel. 

There were the forty-three sepa- 
rate radar, radio and radiation- 
sensing antennae, plus the peri- 
scopes that worked with visual 
light. 

There was the grappling unit 
that stuck out precariously from 
the cylinder’s forward end. 

It was impossible to believe that 
so clumsy and square-cornered 
a construction could fly. It would 
break to pieces, obviously. If by 
some fantastic mischance it didn’t 
fall apart at the first surge of 
power, the protruding sections 
would be snatched off by the rush 
of air. 

But this was not so. 

Explorer II from the moment of 
its first assembly had never felt 
air, and it never would. It was 
never, from first to last, meant 
to accelerate fast enough to cause 
any strain. It was never to operate 
so close to any astronomical ob- 
ject that gravity would have an 
effect. It could afford to look 
clumsy and to be clumsy. For 
clumsiness carried no penalties in 
interstellar space. At its peak 
velocity, just before turnaround, 
Explorer II shot through the void 
at more than half the speed of 
light itself, so fast that mass in- 
creased minutely and the equation 
MV = no longer quite 

held good, but the force that ac- 
celerated it on its way was like 
the pat from a loving hand.

E xplorer II had a captain, 
a good man named Serrell, 
though he didn’t much matter. He 
had taken tractor and trailer to 
the place they had aimed for, a 
planet that had been located nine- 
teen years before. 

The name of the planet — the 
satellite, rather, for it circled an 
object that was itself a planet as 
huge as Jupiter — was Aleph Four. 
There was a stand-by party some- 
where on its surface, or so they 
believed. At least there had been 
three men left by the first expedi- 
tion, awaiting the relief that this 
present voyage was planned to 
supply. 

So the captain’s job was done. 
It was now only a matter of keep- 
ing the cables unsnarled and Ex- 
plorer II in orbit, and waiting for 
the scout rocket to report back, 
and seeing that the colonists with 
all their goods were shuttled down 
to the surface that lay hidden, im- 
der heavy cloud cover and a pun- 
ishingly thick ionosphere that 
blanketed radio waves, a himdred 
thousand miles below. 

That was all there was to it. 
Captain Serrell (though what 
he did now didn’t matter) stayed 
by his conn room and cranked the 
periscope to try to see what he 
couldn’t see. There should have 
been some signal from the scout 
rocket. Voice would be unrecog- 
nizable and even code would 
garble rmless you were very lucky. 



and they hadn’t been lucky. But 
why wasn’t there some sort of sig- 
nal, however faint or garbled? 

Captain Serrell hooked one toe 
under the corner of his desk and 
lit a cigarette. 

The blowers were going, but he 
automatically waved the cigarette 
back and forth, back and forth, in 
the old spaceman’s gesture — a 
habit that climg from the days 
when free-fall meant that an un- 
waved cigarette would go out, 
drowned in its own C02— the days 
when every man’s bimk had a 
little fan blowing day and night on 
his face. 

Those were the days before first 
contact with the Gormen and its 
consequent rapid advances in 
spaceship design, when Captain 
Serrell was no captain but a young 
pilot-officer and fresh to space. 

Now things were better ar- 
ranged, with a free flow of air im- 
pelled by a hundred precisely lo- 
cated fans; but problems remained. 
There was, for example, the prob- 
lem of the Gormen. 

It was foolish to imagine that 
they could have had anything to 
do with the failure of the shuttle 
rocket to report — so Captain Ser- 
rell argued to himself. The first 
contact had occurred in quite an- 
other volume of space; so had the 
second, and so had the bloody 
third and fourth. 

But five men had gone down 
in the rocket and there wasn’t any 



16 



GALAXY 



response, not even a corrupt radio 
signal, not even the return of the 
rocket itself. 

It was foolish to imagine that 
Gormen might be there. The first 
expedition would have found them 
if they were. 

But when you believed that it 
was just barely possible that Gor- 
men mi^ht, it made it hard to 
order the second rocket to go 
down. 

II 

'C’ INALLY, last of the three, 
there was Dr. Brabant. 

Howard Brabant was thirty- 
eight years old, not very tall, not 
very good-looking. He was crew, 
not colonist; he was a psychologist 
by profession, and what would the 
colony need psychology for? But 
he had been thinking, all the same, 
of changing over. 

Now — maybe nobody would 
change over. Maybe there would 
be no colony. Because Explorer 
had come a little late. 

Brabant, sweating more than his 
patient, said sharply: “I don’t care 
how much it hurts, Marne— smile! 
If you can’t smile, at least keep 
your mouth shut!” 

The lieutenant stared blank- 
ly up at him. Brabant braced him- 
self and tugged quickly on Lieu- 
tenant Marne’s fractured arm. 

The lieutenant gnmted once, 
sighed and went unconscious. 



Brabant wiped his forehead. All 
right, let him be imconscious; it 
was better that way. At least that 
way he wouldn’t yell — and that 
might be helpful. (Or might not.) 
But Brabant didn’t have time to 
follow the thought through, be- 
cause he had a compound frac- 
ture to set, and not much skill at 
it. 

He tugged again, and saw the 
jagged white end of bone slip out 
of sight. Good. So much for that. 
As delicately as he could, he poked 
and palpated the flesh of the arm 
where the fracture had occurred. 
As far as he could tell, the bone 
ends were lined up. There was no 
chance of getting an X-ray, of 
course, but it felt all right. Bones 
had been set without X-rays, for 
endless centuries before Roentgen. 
It would have to do. 

He found an antibiotic powder, 
shook it on the wound and began 
the tedious task of splinting and 
bandaging. It was too bad about 
Marne’s arm, but the lieutenant 
was not the worst off of any of 
the first rocket’s crew. There was 
Crescenzi, who was dead; and 
there were de Jouvenel and him- 
self, who were — temporarily — 
alive, and perhaps that was the 
worst of all, because they hadn’t 
the comfort of unconsciousness. 

Because they were not alone in 
the tiny, ancient room. 

There was an audience observ- 
ing every move, taking what 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



17 



looked to be notes; an audience of 
one, but looming large in Brab- 
ant’s mind. He glanced at it un- 
der his eyebrows, then looked 
away. 

It was a hideous thing. 

It wasn’t tall — not more than 
four feet — but it was chunky. 
Flesh hung from it in folds, like 
the hide of a rhinoceros. It had a 
head, and it had two eyes, and 
probably the horny structure at 
the base of its “chin” was a breath- 
ing apparatus. 

It fitted the scale of the tiny 
chamber they were in a lot better 
than the humans did. But that was 
accident. Aliens had built this city, 
but not these aliens. The observer 
that silently noted every move of 
Brabant and de Jouvenal was in 
no way related to the race that 
had constructed their jail. 

That race was dead — gone 
without a hope of revival, leaving 
a planet of vacant cities. But the 
race to which the rhinoceroid crea- 
ture belonged was very much 
alive, as the human race had cause 
to know. 

It was a Gorman. 

^ I ''HE other survivor of the five 
men who had come down in 
the landing party was de Jouvenel, 
a dark, tiny man who kept to him- 
self. He was watching Brabant 
with a face like a little monkey, 
absolutely blank, waiting. 

When Brabant looked up, de 



Jouvenel said: “Finished? Tell me 
something — why do you want 
Marne to smile? Matter of prin- 
ciple, show the aliens how brave 
us Earthmen are?” 

Brabant said regretfully: “I 

don’t know. It was just a thought. 
But the less the Gormen know 
about us, the better chance we 
have to surprise them later on.” 
De Jouvenel looked doubtful. 
“What about Marne’s arm?” 

“I haven’t set a bone in a long 
time, but it looks all right.” 

De Jouvenel nodded and, be- 
fore Brabant could stop him, took 
out a cigarette and lit it. 

Brabant scowled, but it was too 
late to say anything and, ansrway, 
it was still just an idea. But Brab- 
ant observed that as the match 
flared, the Gorman at the door 
made a quick motion of some sort. 
Maybe he was making a note of 
some kind; it stood to reason that 
anything as curious as inhaling 
smoke would be worth noting. So 
probably it was, though the crea- 
ture carried nothing that looked 
like pencil, paper, or any other 
kind of note-taking equipment. 

Brabant sighed and rubbed his 
head. The trouble was you 
couldn’t understand them in terms 
of human referents. They were 
aliens, the only living, intelligent 
race of aliens that the human race 
had ever discovered — to its cost 
— and he had to try to school his 
mind to think of them that way.

GALAXY 



“Cigarette, Doc?” 

Brabant shook his head, sur- 
prised. Why, de Jouvenel was get- 
ting positively chummy. Let the 
alien make another note about 
that: Subject #2 ,does not dis- 
play smoke-tropism of Subject 
#i. Maybe it would confuse them, 
however minutely, and confusing 
them was probably the only 
chance the colonizing party had. 
“How does it feel. Doc?” 
Brabant looked up. 

De Jouvenel grinned wolfish- 
ly. “I mean how does it feel to 
be the bug this time, instead of the 
eye in the microscope? You spent 
enough time watching us. I won- 
dered if you liked it the other 
way around.” 

“That’s my job, de Jouvenel!” 
“Oh, sure. Doc. And you just 
love your work.” 

Brabant said harshly : “Evident- 
ly I’m not good at it. What did I 
do to bring out hostility at a time 
like this?” 

“You didn’t have to do a thing,” 
de Jouvenel said seriously. “Not a 
thing. You think we like having 
somebody like you poke into our 
heads once a week for seven 
years? No offense, but a man 
could be a lot more charming than 
you. Doc, and we still wouldn’t 
like him. Oh,” he said, holding up 
his hand, “sure, we have to have 
somebody like you to keep us 
from blowing up. But we don’t 
have to like it.” 



He came over closer, lowering 
his voice. “Forget it. Talk about 
something more important. That 
fellow over there, he’s built pretty 
funny, but he can only look one 
way at a time, right? Well, how 
about if we work over close to 
him? You keep his eye on you and 
maybe I’ll get a chance to kick 
hell out of him from behind.” 

“No.” 

De Jouvenel nodded. “That’s 
what I thought. Doc, that’s what 
I thought.” He looked at Brabant 
for a moment, his little ape face 
perfectly serious, and then he 
strolled away. 

"O UT it was foolish — they 
^ wouldn’t have a chance! 

Brabant forced himself to take 
his mind off it. It didn’t matter 
what de Jouvenel thought of him, 
at least it didn’t right at this mo- 
ment; what was important was 
that they were in trouble — not 
just the three of them, but the 
whole ship, and perhaps more than 
the ship. 

He checked Marne’s pulse and 
respiration, guessed they were all 
right, and sat back against a wall. 

Here was a planet that had 
been perfectly empty not fifteen 
years before. The first expedition 
had checked it carefully, had 
found thousands of cities and vil- 
lages, and not a sign of life on 
any of them. The first expedition 
had taken a long conscientious 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



19 



year at its job, with • cameras and 
tape recorders and every known 
recording and observing device to 
help them out. 

Nothing. 

There were the cities, but not 
even an animal to prowl their 
streets. There were forests, with a 
few insects, and there were fish 
in the sea. But the cities had been 
built by neither fish nor bugs, but 
by warm-blooded bipeds who had 
known engineering and elec- 
tronics, who had sailed its seas 
and mined its ores. Of them there 
was no survivor. The planet was 
clean. 

Brabant looked around the little 
room. It was a dollhouse, by hu- 
man standards, but the people who 
built it hadn’t been dolls; dolls 
can’t be murdered, as they had 
been. There was no doubt of that 
now. Even when the first expedi- 
tion returned to Earth, the theory 
had been put forth that it was the 
Gormen who had done it, and the 
only reason to doubt it was that 
the Gormen didn’t seem to have 
visited that section of space. But 
here they were, and there was no 
possibility that they were here by 
accident. They had known. 

The scout rocket, navigating by 
computer-directed charts, had 
come down exactly where the per- 
manent party was supposed to 
meet them— the permanent party, 
those three volunteers who had 
remained on Aleph Four to await 

20 



Explorer’s return. But the perma- 
nent party wasn’t there. Then — 
wham-bam, the scout rocket 
landed, the Gormen came pouring 
out of the buildings. 

It hadn’t been a fight. It had 
hardly been an ambush. They 
were simply overpowered. One 
moment they were walking toward 
an empty building in a deserted 
city and the next moment scores 
of fast, fast creatures with thick 
skins and small pig eyes had been 
all over them. Resistance had been 
futile. But they had tried all the 
same, of course. It cost Lieutenant 
Marne a broken femur, com- 
pounded. It had cost Crescenzi 
and elites, the other two men in 
the landing party, a great deal 
more than that. 

Brabant roused himself and 
went over to de Jouvenel. At the 
door, the Gorman turned his head 
alertly to follow. 

“Look,” said Brabant, “I don’t 
want you to think I’m being ar- 
bitrary.” 

“Sure not. Doc,” de Jouvenal 
grunted. 

Brabant tried to be persuasive. 
“Maybe we’ll come to a physical 
attack sooner or later. I don’t 
know. But right now, no. For one 
thing, I’m not sure the two of us 
together could do him any 
damage.” 

“Oh, cut it out. Doc!” The little 
ape face was scowling now. 

“No, I mean it. What do we 



GALAXY 



know about them? How do we 
know what to go for? They move 
quick and they take a lot of pun- 
ishment. Remember when we 
landed? Marne shot one. He shot 
the leg right off it, bht the thing 
hobbled away without making 
a sound. It’s conceivable they 
don’t feel pain. And if they don’t, 
their nervous system must be — 
Well. What I’m trying to say is, 
what makes you think a Gorman 
can be knocked out?” 

De Jouvenel said mildly: “I bet 
they can be killed.” 

“Friend, I don’t think you could 
even kill me with your bare hands.” 
De Jouvenel shrugged and lit 
another cigarette. 

Brabant persisted: “Anyway, 

there’s a chance that the captain 
won’t send the other rocket down, 
since we didn’t signal an all-clear. 
And that means we’re in trouble. 
But if Explorer opts to turn 
around and head for Earth, at 
least the rest of the ship is safe. 
And-” 

He stopped. Both of them stood 
up straight. 

The Gorman had moved. 

^^HERE was no special threat 
in its movement, but it was a 
sort of threat merely to see the 
thing move at last. For hours it 
had been standing there, its stubby 
little hands gripping silvery ob- 
jects that might have been weap- 
ons and might have been recording 



devices, but were certainly un- 
familiar to the men. And then, 
without warning, blur and it was 
halfway across the room, looking 
out a window, and blur again and 
it was back, opening the door. 

“Steady,” Brabant warned. De 
Jouvenel glanced at him without 
expression. 

The Gorman held the door, and 
in a moment another alien came 
in. And behind the second Gor- 
man, something else — a figure, 
bent and shambling . 

A human figure. 

“Good merciful God,” whis- 
pered Brabant, and even de Jou- 
venel beside him said something 
sharp and prayerful. 

It was a human being, all right 
— but just barely. The man in the 
doorway was a million years old; 
he had been dying for all of those 
years, and it had been at least 
half that long since he was fed 
or watered, or had been allowed 
rest. It was impossible that he 
could walk, although he was walk- 
ing; it was unbelievable that he 
could speak. A slim fringe of filthy 
hair surrounded a red and crusted 
scalp. There was a beard, ragged 
and stained. He was nearly naked. 

The man shambled forward, 
within arm’s-length of Brabant 
and de Jouvenel, and looked 
blearily at them out of eyes that 
were red-rimmed with weeping. 
He opened his mouth and tried to 
speak.

“Ka-ka-ka-ka— ” It was a stut- 
tering babble, fighting to break 
through the hateful, opaque cur- 
tain that lay between himself and 
the sane. “Ka-ka-ka— ” 

De Jouvenel whispered urgent- 
ly: “Doc, do you think he might 
be one of the guys that were left 
from the first trip?” 

Brabant shook his head, not to 
say no but to say: I can’t believe 
it. 

True, it had been fifteen years 
since the first ship left. True, cap- 
tivity in Gorman hands would 
probably be no rest cure. But this 
decrepit, destroyed hulk? 

“Ka - ka - ka — ” choked the 
stranger, weeping in rage and fear. 
And then he reeled closer, the 
wrecked eyes on them with a 
watery stare. 

He wiped his wet beard and 
took- a deep, sobbing breath, and 
forced himself to speak. “Captain 
Fa-Farragut?” he croaked. 

Carefully, Brabant put out a 
hand to support the scarecrow. He 
said, forming huge round words 
with his lips as one who speaks 
to a retarded child: “Captain Far- 
ragut is not here. He is back on 
Earth. This is the second expedi- 
tion, not the first.” 

The old man stared and be- 
gan to sway. 

“Too late!” he screamed appal- 
lingly, and fell like an ancient brit- 
tle doll to the floor in front of 
Brabant. 



R ocket Number Two ripped 
into the air of Aleph Four 
with eleven persons aboard, three 
of them children. 

Computerman Hibsen, strapped 
in the padded bucket before the 
controls, shouted and sang along 
with the enormous racket of the 
splitting air. He was enjoying him- 
self. He had very little else to 
do. Piloting a rocket under power 
is a job for machines, not for men. 
The speeds were too fast; the 
decisions had to come too quickly. 
A machine could react fast enough 
to make the minute adjustments 
that meant the difference between 
landing and catastrophe, but not 
the burdened, cogitative human 
mind. 

“Sailor, beware!” 
sang Hibsen; 

“Sailor, take care! 

Many brave hearts 
Lie asleep in the deep.” 

He didn’t have the voice for it, 
either — he was a flat and nasal 
baritone at best — but the rockets 
covered all. And, as mentioned, 
there wasn’t much else to do. 
There was very little to see, even, 
though as the rocket sliced out 
through the bottom of the cloud 
cover at the end of its thousand- 
mile curve, he, and he alone, 
caught kaleidoscope glimpses of 
brown and green and dirty blue. 
But that wasn’t enough to pilot by.

GALAXY 



In the rocket’s plastic nose the 
only eyes that mattered, the spin- 
ning radar plates, felt the land- 
scape below for bumps and ridges, 
and compared them with its built- 
in pattern of course and destina- 
tion, constructed from the first ex- 
pedition’s maps. Digital relays 
took the signal from the radar 
eyes, counted briskly on their 
winking electronic fingers, and se- 
lected the exact increments of 
course and speed that would poise 
them, butt down, over the selected 
landing area. 

The jets flared, flared again; 
the jolt set all the spring cocoons 
bouncing, bouncing. 

“Everybody up!” brayed Hib- 
sen, clawing at the buckles that 
held him in. The eight adults be- 
gan to do the same. 

Rae Wensley, strapped in an 
acceleration cocoon next to the 
Marne baby, reached for the little 
thing crying feebly. 

“That’s a good fellow,” she 
crooned, unbuckling straps. “Good 
little fellow. Oh, nothing to cry 
about.” 

She never stopped talking to the 
child, though probably he couldn’t 
hear — and wouldn’t care if he 
could — and she never looked up, 
until she had found the sterile 
squeeze bottle, prepared at cast- 
off time and still warm enough. 
She uncapped it, popped up the 
nipple with one quick squeeze, and 
cradled the baby. 



It stopped crying in order to 
feed. 

Then she leaned forward to 
look out of the opening port, to 
see just where they were. 

Hibsen was outside already, 
skipping and swearing on the 
smoking ground. 

“Retty!” he yelled, and the red- 
haired crewman dropped gingerly 
out of the port, yowled and 
jumped off the area the jets had 
charred. “Retty, you climb a hill 
or a tree and look around. Colaner, 
stay in the ship. Try to contact 
Captain Serrell and report safe 
landing. Leeks! You and Cannon 
start unloading. And you girls get 
the kids out of the way, will you?” 

Oh, it was a good time for Com- 
puterman Hibsen, with orders to 
give and ten persons to obey them. 

Carefully, Rae Wensley handed 
the baby down to Mary Marne, 
dancing impatiently on the hot 
sand; and then she followed, and, 
for the first time in her nineteen 
years, she stood on soil that had 
never circled Sol. 

It was -hot. 

She hurried off it. 

They were on a beach, a gray 
and grimy one, with water raising 
a small pattern of surf twenty 
yards away. It was hot, not just 
the burned sand but the air. Aleph 
Four’s primary radiated largely 
at the red end; there was heat 
enough, and perhaps more than 
enough, but the light was hardly 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



23 



more than a twilight sky. They 
should be very near to one of the 
deserted cities, Rae knew, but 
there wasn’t any sign of it, only a 
wood of greasy, pendulous trees 
that came down to the sand itself. 

TT was Rae who counted, and 
Hibsen, joyously bellowing or- 
ders, and Brabant crouched over 
the waking, feverish husband of 
Mary Marne hardly a mile away, 
but some of the others counted a 
little too. Mary Marne herself was 
one. 

Time was when Mary Marne 
had been Mary Davison, twenty- 
nine years old, a typist for the 
United Nations Exploration Com- 
mission and engaged to a hero 
of interstellar flight. The engage- 
ment was very real to her, al- 
though it had been entered into 
when she was only sixteen. A girl 
who chose to get engaged to a 
member of an interstellar explora- 
tion party had surely a decade of 
waiting to look forward to, per- 
haps several. It was an unreward- 
ing prospect, but that is not an 
argument persuasive to sixteen- 
year-old minds. 

So young Mary kissed her Flor- 
ian good-by at the spaceport and 
returned to school. Time passed. 
School ended. Mary reached the 
age of twenty-two. She attended 
the bridal showers of her class- 
mates, caught the bouquet at her 
sister’s reception, practiced baby- 



sitting on her first two nephews. 
Florian’s ship was then halfway 
through its deceleration period, 
on the outward leg of its trip. 

Mary went to work for the 
Commission. It helped her to re- 
member Florian. She became a 
typist and remained one; it was 
not her intention to make a career, 
only to mark time for her fiance’s 
return. Other girls in the secre- 
tarial pool dated and married, one 
by one, but not Mary. What had 
started as a teen-ager’s fierce at- 
tempt to mark out a claim on a 
grown-up way of life became a 
matter of obstinate pride, then of 
habit. 

Other girls had been engaged to 
spacemen and, in the long years, 
forgot their engagements. Not 
Mary. Some went through an en- 
tire marriage — engagement, wed- 
ding, childbirth, divorce. Some 
went through more than one. But 
not Mary. She had promised. It 
did not become easier. 

It became harder, for as the 
thirteen years dragged by, toward 
the end a new disturbance began 
to be felt; besides the mating 
thrust of her glands and the pres- 
sure of her fellows, there came 
fear. Who was this Florian whose 
photograph on her desk was a yel- 
lowing lie? Who was this man of 
thirty-one who must by now have 
replaced the eighteen-year-old she 
had pledged to marry? 

The thirteen years ended. 



24 



GALAXY 



Radar sweeps from the satel- 
lites of the methane giants hunted 
ceaselessly for the returning ship, 
and they found it, a decelerating 
blip that took shape as the famil- 
iar tractor-trailer. Chemical rock- 
ets leaped out from them and 
touched it. Radio carried the mes- 
sage back to Earth. 

Mary Marne, eight years later, 
cradling her baby on a stranger 
planet than ever Florian had seen, 
remembered how they had brought 
her the news. Before they said a 
word, she knew, though no one 
had heard of the Gormen then. 
That was the first brush, orbiting 
around a star a dozen light-years 
from where she stood; the explor- 
ing rocket had been destroyed, 
and Florian was on that rocket. 
The eighteen-year-old had never 
reached thirty-one at all. 

Young Mary was hardly heart- 
broken — thirteen years is a long 
time — but she wept. She cried for 
nearly a month, while every TV 
station carried the tapes that the 
shattered survivors had managed 
to bring back, tapes of the Gor- 
man rockets — great, squat, hide- 
ous things — tapes of Gorman 
weapons, and, most chilling of all, 
the tapes that showed the Gor- 
men themselves. 

Gormen — where had the name 
originated? It was as familiar 
throughout Earth as though that 
race had always been known, 
needing only the fact of meeting 



to bring the word leaping to the 
tongue. There was a David Gor- 
man on that poor, dead ship 
— had he named them, or had they 
been named for him, perhaps their 
first victim? Had the Gormen 
communicated with a crew and 
given their own name for them- 
selves? There were other guesses, 
but none of them mattered now, 
even the possibly right ones. Man 
and Gorman had met, and met 
again, and each encounter was a 
bloody clash, and then Explorer 
II was ready to receive its crew, 
and she passed the test. 

It wasn’t, for Mary, an attempt 
to strike back at those who had 
killed her lover, for Explorer II 
was going in the opposite direc- 
tion. It wasn’t a desire for adven- 
ture. It was flight. Mary fled, light- 
years away. 

It was ironical, what there was 
for her at the end of the fleeing. 

T>AE Wensley finished helping 
to offload supplies. Colaner 
was still trying to reach the mother 
ship by radio, but without success. 
Retty had returned from his hill 
to report that he had spotted the 
city, but nothing else, and had 
gone back again. Hibsen, his gem- 
studded tunic dark with sweat, 
was blowing heavily, leaning 
against a tree. 

Rae came to help Mary with 
the baby. Already Gia Crescenzi, 
whose two children were the rest 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



25 



of the complement of the rocket, 
had found something to feed them 
and had brought them to join 
Mary and the baby. The three 
women watched the child, con- 
cerned. 

The baby was not aware that he 
was on a strange planet, he only 
knew that something was squeez- 
ing and pressing him, in a way that 
had never happened before, and 
he didn’t like it. He cried fretfully 
and forever, now that he had fin- 
ished his bottle. He slept briefly, 
and waked to try to lift his tiny 
arms, to turn his wobbly head. 

Rae said sympathetically: “He 
isn’t used to gravity, poor kid.” 

“Poor kid,” echoed Gia Crescen- 
zi, but she was looking at her own 
two. 

The girl was five, the boy a year 
younger; in spite of the sternly en- 
forced hours each day with the 
exercising machines, they were 
making heavy going of trying to 
walk and run and jump on a 
planet. It didn’t matter to them 
that the gravity that had pulled 
down Alexander and Napoleon 
alike had never touched them, that 
the sun that Joshua had stopped 
had become a dwindled and un- 
findable star among millions be- 
yond the cloud cover. It mattered 
to them, as to the baby, that they 
had unwelcome weight It was 
troublesome for a mother, but Gia 
Crescenzi was troubled enough al- 
ready; her husband had gone with 



the first rocket, like Mary Marne’s, 
the rocket that had not been heard 
from. 

Rae thought rebelliously : At 
least they have a right to worry 
about their men. Brabant won’t 
even give me that right. He thinks 
I’m just a child. 

She corralled the two older chil- 
dren and started teaching them 
the fine points of walking. Then— 

“What was that?” cried Gia, her 
voice thin with fear. 

It had been a sound from the 
hanging trees. 

Hibsen jumped up. Colaner’s 
face appeared at the rocket’s port. 
Rae, a child at each arm, swept 
them close to her protectively; it 
had been a frightening sound. 

And frightening in fact. 

Mary Marne screamed. 

SOMETHING was coming out 
^ of the greasy forest — a good 
many somethings, elephantine and 
gray. They came down on the 
party with incredible speed, a 
score of them in the first bunch 
and many more thrusting through 
the trees behind. 

“Gormen!” bellowed Hibsen, 
scrabbling for a stick, a knife, any- 
thing that would be a weapon. 

But there was no weapon. The 
tractor-trailer had had few, and 
all of them had gone with the first 
rocket. 

Hibsen lunged at the Gormen 
barehanded, checked himself.

whirled. “Colaner!” he shouted. 
“Blast off!” 

It was a triumph of reason over 
instinct. Instinct said Fight! but 
there was no hope in a fight. The 
only hope was that miraculously 
the rocket might get safely off. 

But it wasn’t a day for miracles. 
The Gormen were all around now, 
not brutal, not cruel, merely in- 
vincible; there was a knot of them 
around every human, even the 
children. Colaner had heard, and 
he did his best. Red fire roared 
from the rocket. 

But no man could balance that 
ship, only the computer, and that 
had not been programmed for the 
return trip. Whatever Colaner did, 
it was not enough. The rocket 
danced and wobbled, painfully 
climbing. It hung crookedly over- 
head, singeing them all; it was like 
a shower of acid. The smell of 
crisping hair — and flesh — filled 
their nostrils. 

And the Gormen had them all. 

All but two. Not Colaner, who 
somehow got the rocket slashing 
waveringly out to sea. And not 
Leeks, who had been closest to 
the rocket and would never need 
to fear capture again. His cindered 
body flopped to the gray sand, 
scratched against it, lay still. 

Half a mile out to sea, the 
rocket plunged into the water with 
a plume of steam and, moments 
later, a wild roar, as the children 
began to shriek.

TJAE Wensley limped along a 
resilient street between emp- 
ty buildings, in darkness. She 
ached and she was frightened, but 
it was queerly exciting, all the 
same, to be walking through a city 
that had been built by a dead race. 
Beside her, Hibsen stalked angrily 
along, carrying one of Gia Cres- 
cenzi’s children. The boy was 
whimpering softly. The sound 
caught at Rae’s heart, for the 
child was fretfully repeating, 
“Mommy! Mommy!” 

And his mother had made the 
mistake of attacking one of the 
Gormen. 

Mary Marne panted from be- 
hind: “Look! Isn’t that the other 
rocket?” It was something, cer- 
tainly enough, something that was 
tall enough to loom over the 
rather low buildings and metallic 
enough to catch a few glints of 
light from somewhere. 

“That’s it,” snapped Hibsen, 
straining to see. 

They rounded a corner and 
there it was — the rocket, all right, 
squatting silently on its skids in 
a broad plaza. From one of the 
buildings, light streamed out, but 
the Gormen hurried them past it, 
not even pausing, though one of 
the Gormen that had captured 
them shouted something in their 
high-pitched quacking and was an- 
swered from inside. Another build-

ing, this one smaller and isolated 
from those around it, showed 
fainter, bluer light as they ap- 
proached. They were hustled in- 
side. 

Rae stumbled past a motionless 
Gorman at the door, blinked and 
cried: “It’s them! Mary, your hus- 
band’s here!” It was a little room, 
with a flaring blue light dangling 
from the ceiling, and Marne lay 
propped on one elbow, blinking up 
at them, in a corner of it. De Jou- 
venel squatted beside him, his 
dark face comically surprised. No 
one else. 

Rae said to Lieutenant Marne 
urgently: “Where’s Dr. Brabant?” 
But Marne had no patience for 
that sort of question, not just then. 
He pushed himself up, and Rae 
saw. that one arm was in a sling. 

“Mary!” he shouted and rushed 
toward them, half-crouched; he 
was not a tall man, but his head 
brushed the ceiling of that room. 
His wife ran to him. The baby 
was in one arm, but the other 
arm was free and she wrapped it 
around him in a great soundless 
passion of relief. Rae, watching, 
felt something inside her move 
oddly. 

She caught de Jouvenel’s arm. 
“Where’s Brabant?” He looked at 
her and his face went all stiff and 
opaque. “Please!” she begged. 

“He’s alive,” de Jouvenel said 
unwillingly. “Or he was an hour 
ago.” 

28 



“Then where-” 

The man’s voice was hostile. “I 
don’t know,” he snapped, and 
brushed past her to join the others. 

^HE wandered through the 
^ house that the Gormen had 
turned into a prison for them. 
She had seen photographs of the 
desecrated buildings on Aleph 
Four; all of the colonists had. But 
the photographs didn’t show scale, 
didn’t show the finicky smallness 
of the rooms, didn’t show the deli- 
cate daintiness of the furnishings. 

There was nothing left of the 
builders of the houses but a few 
pictures, pictures of frail bipedal 
creatures with lemur’s eyes. But 
they had not been gone long. Even 
in this damp climate, wood and 
paperlike objects had not had time 
to decay. The house they were 
in was three stories high, each 
story less than six feet from floor 
to ceiling, except for a few larger 
rooms at the back of the ground 
floor. All the rooms were free to 
the captured humans, but nothing 
outside. The Gorman at the door 
by which they had entered was 
only one guard; there were others, 
outside and on the tough but yield- 
ing roof. 

But, in all truth, that was not 
the major preoccupation of Rae 
Wensley’s mind. She was begin- 
ning to form a most peculiar no- 
tion of the previous inhabitants of 
Aleph Four. Plumbing was not a

feature of their architecture. The 
marks of gracious living were in 
the rooms, but grace for them con- 
sisted in things that looked beau- 
tiful and served beautiful func- 
tions. 

There was statuary — it might 
have been statuary, an5rway. There 
were musical instruments — one a 
sort of tuned drum, with a molded 
head that produced a diatonic 
scale around the rim. There were 
pictures, some representational, 
some perhaps not — it was hard to 
tell. But there was very little else 
that, to Rae Wensley, marked the 
difference between civilization and 
animal existence. It was, she 
thought, torn between discomfort 
and giggling, not one of the more 
easily accepted hardships of space 
flight that nowhere in sight was 
there a door marked “Powder 
Room.” 

It Wasn’t until Mary Marne 
found her wandering, listened, 
laughed, and showed her the as- 
tonishingly convenient vegetative 
arrangements in the cellar that 
Rae’s spirits improved enough to 
let her worry about Brabant. 

'M^HEN she got back to the 
main room, where the silent 
Gorman guard still stood, there 
was a stranger. 

“Rae!” cried Hibsen. “Where’ve 
you been? Never mind! This is 
Sam Jaroff, Rhe — from the first 
expedition!” 



They pushed her forward. Ob- 
viously, this man needed help, and 
she was the nearest thing left to 
a doctor, having had the practice 
of caring for babies in the trailer. 
Rae poked around in the emer- 
gency kit while the old man did 
his choking best to answer a 
thousand questions. 

He was frightening, she thought, 
frightening! He had eaten poorly 
for a long time. Massive diet de- 
ficiencies were obvious in his 
sparse hair, his dry and crusted 
skin, even the weeping old eyes. 
The only cure for that was rest 
and food, Rae thought worriedly, 
reading labels, but probably some 
vitamin concentrates would help. 

While she was working, the 
Marne baby woke long enough to 
scream. 

Mary hurried to feed it; the 
Gorman at the door looked silent- 
ly and, blur, he was standing over 
them to peer down at the little red 
face. It was like a carved thing, 
watching; then, without a sign, it 
went blur to the door again and 
stood waiting. 

Sam Jaroff twisted restlessly un- 
der Rae’s hands, saw the Gorman 
and screamed thinly. It paid no 
attention. He gasped: “Sorry, 

miss!” 

Hibsen looked at the girl and 
shook his head. “He’s had it 
rough,” he said without humor. 

But the old man heard. 
“Rough?” He sat up. “Every day

I wished I was dead. Skinner was 
the lucky one.” 

“Ssh,” soothed Rae, pressing 
him down, but the man shook her 
off; he wanted to talk. 

Hibsen and de Jouvenel helped 
him to lean against a wall. He 
said: “There were the three of us, 
Chapman, Skinner and me. We 
were here a year and a half. Then 
we saw the ship.” 

He breathed hard for a mo- 
ment, the rheumy old eyes blink- 
ing. “Skinner saw it,” he said. “He 
was the radioman and he picked 
something up that he couldn’t 
read. Well, he said so — but we 
didn’t believe him, you know, not 
at first. We never heard of Gor- 
men. I never heard the name 
until Dr. Brabant said it. We 
didn’t know there was anything 
alive in space except people, and— 

“Well, we learned.” He coughed 
hoarsely, looked up into Rae’s 
eyes and quickly covered his 
mouth. “Sorry,” he mumbled. 
“An3Tway, after Skinner claimed 
he got these signals, we kept a 
watch and maybe we saw the 
ship. I guess we did. There was 
something, and we thought it 
might be a meteorite, but it must 
have been a Gorman rocket. But 
we didn’t know for sure, and then 
nothing happened. For a long 
time. It’s all in the log, in case you 
want to read it. I guess it’s still 
around someplace. Not in this 
building, of course. But the Gor- 



men have that log now, and — 
“Well, anyway. Nothing hap- 
pened, like I say, for a long time. 
Two years. We put crops in, down 
by the creek, but they didn’t do 
well. Root vegetables died. Car- 
rots, potatoes, turnips — the car- 
rots would grow down about an 
inch and a half, and then nothing. 
By the time they were big enough 
to eat, they were all knotted up, 
not worth eating. It was like the 
topsoil was too thin, you know? 
Like somebody living in a devel- 
opment house where the builder 
just put in enough to make the 
first spring’s lawn and— But it 
wasn’t that, though. There’s plenty 
of topsoil, but below the surface, 
nothing lived. I thought about it 
for years,” he said earnestly, “and, 
you know, I’m damned if I under- 
stand it. At first I thought it was 
too much moisture, but— 

“Sorry,” he said, coughing and 
wiping his face. “I kind of forgot 
how to talk. Anyway, the crops 
didn’t work out so well. Well, then. 
The aliens came back. That thing 
we saw, it must’ve been a ship, 
and they must’ve spotted us. 
Where were they those two years? 
I don’t know. They’ve got a kind 
of a camp on Bes. That’s where I 
was for a couple years. Maybe 
they were there all the time, even 
when Captain Farragut was here. 
But we didn’t see them, until—” 
Jaroff stopped and wept silent- 
ly.

T¥IBSEN said harshly: “Look, 
you don’t have to tell us all 
this right now! There’s plenty of 
time!” 

“I want to,” said Jaroff, rubbing 
his watery eyes. “And are you sure 
about plenty of time? I’m not. 
There might not be any time at 
all.” He twisted uncomfortably 
against the wall, his eyes on the si- 
lent Gorman at the door. 

He said: “They came at night. 
We were all asleep. No guards, 
nothing like that. Well, who would 
think we needed them? But the 
noise should have woke us up. It 
didn’t, though. What woke me was 
—was Chapman screaming. 

“He wasn’t in the house with 
Skinner and me,” Jaroff explained 
carefully. “We’d had a kind of— 
not a fight, but we weren’t getting 
along so well. He’d lost one of 
Skinner’s books, see, and so Skin- 
ner wouldn’t lend him the ukele 
and Chapman — 

“It doesn’t matter. But Chap- 
man moved out and set up his 
own place in one of the buildings 
across the street. The red one. We 
called it the House of Morgan. 
There was a little inlaid thing on 
the ceiling and it was gold, and 
Skinner called it that, and— 

“The Gormen went there first. 
We woke up, hearing him scream- 
ing, and we came running— 
“Chapman was still alive,” Jaroff 
said slowly. “Oh, he lived about 
two years after that. He even went 



to Bes with me. I didn’t see him 
much, but after he died I saw him. 
They used him for dissection. I 
guess they wanted to— to— ” 

Jaroff stopped and looked at the 
floor for a moment. Then, “They 
hurt me a lot,” he said, very soft- 
ly, “testing my reflexes and like 
that. But they didn’t kill me, al- 
though I asked them. I begged 
them. 

“Skinner they killed, right there 
in the House of Morgan. He had a 
gun, and he shot six of them 
first. 

“So then I was on Bes for — 
Dr. Brabant figured it out for me. 
About ten years, after Chapman 
died. Eating mush, and all the time 
they were watching me. Some- 
times they wouldn’t bother me for 
a couple of weeks, and sometimes 
the mush tasted funny and I got 
sick. They were trying things, you 
see. They tried a lot of things. 
Sometimes they hurt me.” He 
rubbed the fine lacework of white 
scar tissue on his arm. 

“And then they brought me back 
here. It was about a month ago, 
and I didn’t know why, but may- 
be I know why now. I guess they 
saw Explorer II on their radar, if 
they have radar. Or perhaps you 
sent a message and they got it. I 
don’t know. 

“But I’m pretty sure they knew 
you were coming, and that’s why 
they brought me right back here. 
I think they were going to use me

for bait, maybe. Put me out in the 
open, with a lot of them all around, 
hiding. But they didn’t have to. 
They-” 

He began to sob. 

Hibsen stood ui>. That’s 
enough,” he growled. “Let him 
alone.” He turned to the Gorman 
guard. 

But de Jouvenel’s hand was on 
his arm and, after a moment, Hib- 
sen looked down at the little dark 
man and nodded. 

“All right,” Hibsen said. “I’m 
not going to do anything.” 

T> AE was half asleep on the floor, 
the baby snoring in quick 
light breaths beside her, when she 
felt Hibsen’s hand on her shoul- 
der. 

“Council of war,” he said. “Come 
on, Rae, wake up. The Gorman’s 
gone.” 

She looked at the door; it was 
true. The room was almost com- 
pletely dark, but enough light flick- 
ered in from the Gorman build- 
ings across the square to show 
shadowy figures, the walls, the 
scant furnishings. The Gorman 
wasn’t there. 

“Wake up,” said Hibsen more 
loudly, stirring Mary Marne and 
her husband with his toe as they 
lay side by side nearby. “De Jou- 
venel, you awake? Retty?” 

They all came awake at once. 

Hibsen said : “Retty, stay by the 
door. We don’t know how long 



that thing’s going to be away. 
Keep an eye open.” He turned to 
Marne. “Lieutenant, you rank me. 
Do you want to take charge?” 
Marne shook his head. “I’m not 
much use with this arm. Anyway, 
it doesn’t matter right now, does 
it?” 

“It might,” said Hibsen. 

“There’s our ship out there and 
we’re not guarded. Well? What 
about it?” 

Rae caught her breath. “But it 
can’t carry all of us!” 

“It can carry some of us,” Hib- 
sen corrected. Sam Jaroff, propped 
on his elbow at the fringe of the 
group, moaned softly. “That’s 

right,” Hibsen brutally clarified. 
“Some of us would have to stay 
behind.” 

Rae Wensley said sharply: 

“That’s not fair! What about the 

children?” Hibsen shook his head. 
“And Sam Jaroff? And what about 
Dr. Brabant? He isn’t even here 
—how can we go off and leave 
him?” 

“He left us.” 

“Now that’s a—” 

“Shut up, Rae!” Hibsen’s voice 
snapped like a mule-skinner’s 
whip. “Don’t talk about what’s fair. 
This is a matter of survival.” He 
moved quickly to the window, 
nodded and returned. “The rock- 
et’s right there. There’s no Gorman 
in sight, though I can hear them 
across the square. I can get into 
that rocket without being seen, I

promise. Five minutes and I’ll 
have a course set on the com- 
puters that will take us close 
enough to Explorer’s orbit. But it 
won’t be accurate, so I’ll need re- 
serve power for maneuvering. That 
means—” he hesitated— “not more 
than three people.” 

“Three-” 

“Three people alive,” he cut in 
grimly, “is better than all of us 
right here dead! And Captain Ser- 
rell hanging up there, fat and 
happy — until the Gormen get 
around to locating him and knock- 
ing the whole ship off!” 

“No,” said Rae Wensley posi- 
tively. “Not without Brabant.” 
“The devil with Brabant! He 
went off with the Gormen. If he 
likes them so well, he can stay!” 

S HE shook her head. Her mind 
was closed; she wasn’t pre- 
pared to listen. She said: “Don’t 
you see? When he comes back, 
he’ll have more information for us. 
What right have you to think he 
had anything to say about whether 
he went with them or not? And 
certainly he’ll use every chance 
he gets to find out their weak 
spots. They—” 

“They haven’t got any,” said 
Sam Jaroff’s hoarse, thin voice, 
and he caught her arm. “Listen to 
him, girl! I’m scared, but it doesn’t 
matter how scared I am — he’s 
right. Let him get away! We’re 
all dead here anyway.” 



“Right,” said Hibsen. “Now let’s 
get down to it. Rae, you’re over- 
ruled. De Jouvenel, stand by while 
I try to make it to the scout 
rocket. Once I’m inside, if any 
Gormen wander along, you’ll have 
to-” 

“Hibsen!” hissed Retty pierc- 
ingly from the door. “Come here 
and take a look!” 

All of them came crowding 
around the windows and the open 
door, looking out onto the little 
square. 

Gormen were out there. 

There were at least a dozen of 
them, and they were moving 
around the first scout rocket, 
crouched cold and silent on its 
skids. 

“We’ll have to wait,” said Hib- 
sen, his eyes fixed on the aliens. 
“Maybe they’ll go away.” 

“They’re not going to go away,” 
whispered Rae. “Look, Hibsen! 
What are they doing?” 

The squat quick things were in 
and out of the rocket’s port. Like 
ponderous jack rabbits, they 
hopped up into the belly of the 
little ship and those inside be- 
gan handing things out to those on 
the ground. And the things they 
were handing out— 

Glittering metal instrumenta- 
tion. Black slabs of panel mount- 
ing. Copper entrails of wire. 

“They’re taking out the com- 
puters!” cried Lieutenant Marne, 
holding his splinted arm. “Hibsen,

do you know what that means? 
We wouldn’t be able to fly the 
rocket now, even if we could get 
to it!” 

“That’s right,” snarled Hibsen. 
“Pretty clever, eh? And what do 
you suppose gave them that idea?” 

He turned a face of fury on Rae 
Wensley. She couldn’t help it; she 
recoiled from the rage he showed. 

“Thafs pretty smart,” he said. 
“They know a lot about us, don’t 
they? And there’s only one place 
they could have learned it— from 
your pet headshrinker, Brabant!” 

V 

A LL through the night, sputter- 
ing electric flares illuminated 
the square outside the building 
where the humans were captive. 

Under the flickering light, the 
gray Gormen worked to pile frag- 
ments of control mechanism onto 
a high-wheeled cart. It was a mad- 
dening sight for Hibsen; he knelt 
by the window as long as he could, 
feeling every hammer blow on his 
own flesh. But not even rage can 
sustain wakefulness forever, and 
in time he slept. 

Rae Wensley woke him in the 
morning. She had got up to the 
baby’s crying, fed him, changed 
him and put him in a corner, a 
tilted table protecting him from 
being stepped on. Hibsen heard 
and came instantly awake. 

He sat up, looked around once 



and scowled. Outside, the square 
was empty of life. Cold damp air 
rolled in the open door. Gray light 
was coming up. 

“I see they’re through,” Hibsen 
whispered bitterly, nodding toward 
the square. 

But Rae was more preoccupied 
with other problems. She had dis- 
covered there were only three 
more sterile bottles of formula for 
the baby, plus what little was in 
his mother’s breasts. Mary Marne’s 
intentions were good, but she had 
not been able to nurse the child. 
It was absolutely essential to find 
a substitute. 

She said as much to Hibsen. He 
shrugged. “Three bottles is a whole 
day, isn’t it? We’ll see.” 

“And we’re out of diapers.” 

He got up and walked away. 
“Ask your friend Brabant,” he said 
over his shoulder. “He’s on good 
terms with the local authorities.” 

He left the girl angry, but that 
was the way he wanted her to be, 
angry. Anger is too powerful a 
force to be confined; it bursts out 
and drenches whatever object is 
convenient. If he left her angry 
enough, perhaps some of it would 
erupt at the headshrinker. 

And that was fair and just, Hib- 
sen considered, because he was at 
least half sincere in saying that 
he believed Brabant had sold out 
to the Gormen. What’s more, it 
served his ends. There was still 
the chance of escape — somehow.

And it was going to be a long, 
lonely voyage back to Earth, and 
it would be much less lonely if 
Rae Wensley came along. 

Without the headshrinker. 

^T^HE Gorman was back inside 
^ the door again, watching, 
watching. De Jouvenel, dunking a 
cake of compressed cereal into 
cold black coffee, said dourly: “I 
wanted to jump that thing. Brab- 
ant wouldn’t let me. What do you 
think, Hibsen?” 

Hibsen grinned tightly. “I 
think—” He glanced at Rae Wens- 
ley and winked. “I think you bet- 
ter hurry up with that cup, Joe. 
Others are waiting.” 

Rae was trembling. “Stop it! I 
know you don’t like Dr. Brabant, 
but this is no way to talk! You’ve 
got no right to assume he’s doing 
anything wrong. You weren’t even 
here when the Gormen took him 
away!” 

“He didn’t struggle very hard,” 
de Jouvenel observed. 

Hibsen shook his head. “No, 
Joe, that’s no way to talk. We’ve 
got no right to assume anything 
wrong.” And he winked again. 

He got up and drifted over to 
the window, well pleased. Out 
there was scout rocket one, squat- 
ting patiently. Maybe, thought 
Hibsen, maybe yet— 

But it was out of the question. 
They couldn’t possibly fly that 
one. Not without the built-in com- 



puting autopilots. But there was 
the chance — maybe, possibly — 
that they could find and re-install 
the computing mechanisms. Or 
something. Anyway— 

“Hey,” said Hibsen, “come here 
a minute, Marne. What’s that?” 
He pointed across the square. 
There was a building, more or less 
like the others, but light glinted 
from something inside it. 

“Looks like gold,” de Jouvenel 
ventured. “Jar off, is that the place 
you call the House of Morgan?” 
The old man limped over. 
“That?” he said, squinting. “No. 
The one with the pink roof, that’s 
the House of Morgan. That’s 
where they got Skinner, you know. 
When they first landed.” 

“Well, then, what the devil is 
it?” 

“That’s their ship,” Jaroff said 
wearily, and dragged himself back. 

Hibsen caught his breath. “Their 
ship.” 

Then, he stood straight, his head 
nearly brushing the ceiling. “All 
right!” he said in a harsh tone. 
“That’s the answer! They’ve 
messed up our rocket — we’ll use 
theirs!” He looked around at the 
circle of doubting faces. “What’s 
the matter now? Don’t you believe 
I can fly it?” 

“No,” said a voice from the 
door, “I don’t believe you can.” 
They all turned. There was 
Brabant, two Gormen behind him, 
standing in the door.

Silence for a second. 

Then, “Come in, Doc,” said Hib- 
sen, “come right in. We’ve been 
wanting to talk to you. Bring your 
friends, if you like. They’re just 
as welcome as you are.” 

"DRABANT came in, glancing 
at Rae, but his face was im- 
passive. 

Hibsen breathed on the star 
sapphire in his left lapel and bur- 
nished it on his other sleeve. It 
was a habit of his; it made him 
feel a little more comfortable in 
situations of strain. He said po- 
litely: “Did you have a nice time. 
Doc?” 

“Not very.” 

“That’s too bad,” said Hibsen, 
shaking his head in regret. “I guess 
they just don’t know how to treat 
a guest. Right, Jaroff?” The old 
man looked dimly away. “Well, 
when you came in, you had some 
comments to make on my idea, 
didn’t you. Doc? You said I 
couldn’t fly the Gorman ship.” 
“And you can’t.” 

“Mind telling me why?” 
“Because,” Brabant said, “you’re 
not a Gorman. You ought to know 
that much, Hibsen, being a com- 
puterman! Why do you think they 
pulled the course-computers out 
of the scout rocket?” 

“As a matter of fact,” Hibsen 
said, “we were wondering about 
that. Dr. Brabant.” 

“Because they don’t need them. 



that’s why! We do, but they don’t 
— that’s the way Gormen are 
built.” 

Hibsen said angrily, knowing it 
was untrue, unable to keep from 
saying it: “I can do anything they 
can do! Whose side are you on?” 

Brabant blazed: “You /odl! Do 
you think you can fly a rocket 
without computers? You can’t! No 
man can as much as balance a 
rocket on its tail — it takes a ma- 
chine to do that. And the machines 
aren’t there. The Gormen never 
had them in their own ship, so 
naturally they’ve taken them out 
of ours! Curiosity? I don’t know. 
It’s as good an explanation as 
anv.” 

He fcOt up and pointed out the 
window. The three impassive 
aliens watched him with their eyes, 
but didn’t move. 

“Look out there! See those 
buildings down the square? 
They’re full of Gormen! I guaran- 
tee you can’t take a single step out 
this building without one of them 
being right on your back. They’re 
fast. But even if you could, then 
what? It doesn’t matter which ship 
you go for, our scout or theirs; 
it needs a machine to fly it. You’ve 
all been in rockets at takeoff. You 
know what happens. A couple of 
seconds of full blast, and they 
haven’t even moved yet. 

“Then they begin to lift — oh, 
maybe a couple of inches in the 
next second. In the fifth second.

they can gain perhaps 'a foot or 
two. But they have to get upward 
of fifty or sixty miles an hour to 
become aerodynamically stable — 
and that takes fifteen seconds. And 
in those fifteen seconds, friend, you 
can be dead a dozen times. Any- 
thing — anything — can tip the 
ship, just a fraction of a second of 
arc, but when it begins to tip, it 
has to be corrected — not when 
you get around to it, but right now. 
Are you fast enough for that, Hib- 
sen? You’re not. I’m not. No hu- 
man being is.” 

He turned from the window. 
“As far as we’re concerned, those 
ships might as well not be there.” 

TTIBSEN stood looking angrily 
after Brabant as the psy- 
chologist walked away, over to the 
wall where their scant rations lay 
heaped, and selected a biscuit. 

Absently Hibsen rubbed his 
sapphire, unable to take his eyes 
off Brabant. No one spoke, and 
that annoyed Hibsen; what right 
did the headshrinker have to come 
in and demolish their plans? 
All right, he thought irritably, 
maybe it wasn’t going to be easy. 
But surely there was a way. There 
had to be a way. Otherwise that 
star sapphire would wind up in 
some rhinoceros-skinned alien’s 
pocket, a toy for the kiddies, may- 
be, instead of a couple of decades 
of happy living for Robert Hib- 
sen, Esq. 



De Jouvenel said across the 
room: “What’s the matter. Doc? 
Didn’t your friends feed you?” 
Brabant, chewing, said stolidly: 
“No.” But his expression was 
strained. Hibsen noticed and was 
maliciously amused. Why, Doc’s 
worried too, he thought. 

Brabant looked at the half bis- 
cuit, uneaten, in his hand, stopped 
chewing and put it down. “Well, 
we’ll have to do better than this. 
I’ve arranged for supplies to be 
brought out of the scout rocket.” 
“What?” Rae Wensley de- 
manded. “How—” 

Brabant’s expression changed 
slightly, queerly, almost to a look 
of embarrassment. “I’ve made 
some arrangements with them,” he 
said, his voice not very loud. “I— 
I’ll need your cooperation — all of 
you — to help carry them out.” 
De Jouvenel laughed without 
humor. 

Rae asked sharply: “What ar- 
rangements?” 

“The only kind that are open 
to me,” Brabant said steadily. 
“Please, Rae. Don’t act as if I had 
any choice or—” 

“What arrangements?” 

Hibsen saw, with more pleasure 
than he had expected to find in 
anything that day, in that place, 
that Rae’s face was filled with ap- 
prehension and the faint forebod- 
ing of anger. Well, he thought, 
well! Maybe the kid was getting 
smart!

Brabant said shortly: “I made 
an even trade. Information for our 
lives. They want to study us — 
we let them. In exchange, they let 
us feed ourselves and they prom- 
ise not to — to — ” He faltered, 
looking at Sam Jaroff. 

“They promise!” Rae Wensley 
cried. “Whafs the matter with 
you?” 

“There’s no choice,” Brabant 
protested. “How do you know, 
maybe with our cooperation they’ll 
learn enough so that they can 
find a way to get along with the 
human race! After all, we’re as 
much freaks to them as they to us 
—they didn’t expect to find crea- 
tures with the power of star flight 
any more than we did! Psycho- 
logically, we’re a complete mystery 
to them — as much as they are to 
us — and that’s my department, 
of course. So I’ve agreed to—” 

De Jouvenel snapped: “To help 
them conquer Earth.” 

“No! To-” 

“Don’t lie, Brabant!” shouted 
Marne, his splinted arm forgotten, 
shouldering his way forward. “Giv- 
ing aid and comfort to the enemy 
is treason! You louse, your skin is 
worth a lot to you, isn’t it? But it’s 
worth less to us! You know what 
treason means?” 

“Shut up!” said Brabant. “You 
don’t have a choice. The Gor- 
men— ” 

“Oh, but we do, headshrinker,” 
interrupted Hibsen at last. He 



pushed Marne and de Jouvenel 
aside to face Brabant. “Our choice 
is cooperation or death — your 
death, Brabant! And don’t think 
we can’t kill you!” 

Brabant stood quietly looking 
at him for a second, then nodded, 
his expression bleak. “Yes,” he 
said, “I thought you’d get around 
to that. But you’re wrong there 
too, Hibsen. You can’t kill me. 
The Gormen won’t let you.” 
“They’ll never know! Some day 
when you’re not expecting it—” 
“They already know,” Brabant 
said, not raising his voice. “Didn’t 
Jaroff tell you? Every last one of 
them speaks English.”

"DRABANT and his two Gor- 
man companions had gone, 
taking Sam Jaroff with them. It 
had not been a pleasant depar- 
ture; the old man had screamed 
terribly, waking the baby, upset- 
ting the orphaned Crescenzi chil- 
dren. But will he, nill he — he had 
gone, hardly reassured even in 
part by Brabant’s sworn promise 
that he wouldn’t be hurt. 

Just as Rae got the two chil- 
dren calm enough to consider a 
nap, a party of Gormen came 
rapidly, silently in. Speak English 
or not, their purpose was not con- 
versation. They fanned out and 
swiftly, without pause or consulta- 
tion, began going through every 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



39 



single article of food, clothing or 
equipment in the room. 

“Hibsen!” cried Rae at the in- 
ner door. “All of you, come here! 
They’re up to something!” 

The men came hurrying down 
and clotted at the doorway, inde- 
cisive, but there was nothing for 
them to do. The aliens didn’t touch 
any person; it was only the inani- 
mate possessions of the party that 
interested them. And those they 
went through with the meticulous 
care of monkeys preening their 
mates for salt. 

“They’re searching us,” Hibsen 
said. “Looking for weapons, I 
guess. Well, that’s a laugh! I wish 
we had some for them to find.” 
But the Gormen drew a broader 
line than his. A steel rule that 
could conceivably be filed to a 
point, the single glass nursing 
bottle that Mary had somehow ac- 
quired among the one-use plastics 
(it could be shattered, perhaps), 
everything that might have an 
edge or produce a bang was found 
and confiscated. 

“They’re thorough enough,” 
Hibsen said bitterly. “All right, let 
them go ahead. There’s nothing we 
can do about it anyway — now.” 
But they weren’t waiting for his 
permission; they finished their job 
and stood briefly at the door. 

For the first time, Rae Wens- 
ley heard one of them speak. It 
was a thin rabbity squeal, too 
faint to make much of an impres- 



sion, but it was clearly a language. 
There was question and answer, 
and then half the party left, car- 
rying their few trophies . 

And the other three came pur- 
posefully toward Rae. 

She screamed. She couldn’t help 
it; it was too sudden — so sudden 
that she couldn’t stop the scream 
and barely had time to start it; 
so sudden that she couldn’t hear 
the sudden shouts from the men, 
or see how two of the Gormen 
interposed themselves — fast, fast! 
— between her and the men, while 
the other picked her up, as quick, 
as brisk, as carelessly as a merry- 
go-round rider snatching the brass 
ring. Half a second, it seemed, 
and she had barely caught her 
breath to scream again and she 
was already outside, the other Gor- 
men a solid barrier at the door 
behind her. 

^HE was lugged across the 
^ square and into a building. 
Squeaking Gormen were all over 
the building, more than a score of 
them, surely, but she didn’t have 
a chance to count or to conjecture 
on what they were doing, she was 
carried so swiftly and carelessly 
up a flight of stairs. The alien who 
carried her made no sound. How- 
ever rapidly one foot descended 
on the tread above the other, it 
was placed just there, with just the 
right force; it didn’t stamp, it 
didn’t stumble. She could hear.

from the floor above, a human 
voice, droning a long steady 
stream, growing louder as she ap- 
proached. 

The Gorman dumped her up- 
right on the floor and vanished, as 
silent descending the stairs as he 
had been coming up. 

Brabant was in the room. So 
was Sam Jaroff — it was his voice. 
He sat half-reclining on an im- 
provised chair,’ his eyes closed, 
talking endlessly. 

Rae opened her mouth, but 
Brabant, frowning, shook his head, 
held a finger to his lips. He seemed 
mildly surprised to see her, but 
not very; he didn’t, in fact, seem 
interested in her, only in Jaroff. 

“—the one that had a green 
thing on his shoulder,” Jaroff was 
saying. “A kind of an emblem with 
three leaves — only not leaves, but 
sort of swirly things. Like the way 
fire is drawn coming out of a pin- 
wheel, spinning back. And he was 
heavier than the other one— about 
ten per cent, I’d say, or almost; 
and when they cut my arm, he 
used both hands, but the other 
only used his left. The little one 
in the green room, though, used 
his right when he put the elec- 
trodes around my arm. The thing 
about him was the little box he 
carried, gold, with eleven white 
dots and two red ones on the out- 
side, four white in a line, then—” 

Jaroff droned on. It was very 
queer of Dr. Brabant, Rae thought. 



catching her breath, to be practic- 
ing deep recall on the old man 
in front of the Gormen. 

She looked around the room. 
It was larger than any of those in 
the house the Gormen had given 
them for a prison, and it con- 
tained things she couldn’t recog- 
nize but that looked out of place 
—black metallic things, gold things; 
Gorman things, most likely. This 
building was obviously their head- 
quarters, or a part of it. It had a 
sour reek that, she realized, had 
been in her nostrils for a long 
time. She’d thought of it as the 
smell of Aleph Four, but now she 
began to wonder. Perhaps it was 
a Gorman smell. 

Then she saw something that 
was not Gorman. 

It was black, but its insides were 
glass, steel and copper; it had 
come from the scout rocket. The 
parts were here! Joy swelled in- 
side her. They were here. Brabant 
had saved them. No doubt he had 
a plan. And— 

She looked more carefully, and 
all that was- here was a tape re- 
corder, part of the radio equip- 
ment, and a few cells from the 
power pack. Something Brabant 
was using, no doubt, in whatever 
it was he was doing. But it wasn’t 
what they needed to make that 
ship fly. 

“—after Skinner died,” Jaroff 
was continuing. “Then I was sick 
for a long time, because of the

greenish lumps in the mush, I 
guess. There were more of them 
than there were of the purple later 
,on, and they were a little bigger. 
While I was feverish, the rhino 
from the green room came eight 
times and—” 

There was a murmur from one 
of the Gormen and Brabant said, 
cheerfully enough: “All right, 

Jaroff. Snap out of it.” 

The old man woke, blinked, saw 
the Gormen, and quailed. 

“Don’t worry,” Brabant reas- 
sured him. “That’s all for today. 
You can go back to the others 
now.” Jaroff, trembling, walked 
hesitantly to the door of the room 
and paused. “Down the stairs. Go 
ahead. One of the Gormen down 
there will convoy you to the 
others. Nothing to be afraid of.” 

Brabant watched him out of 
sight, then turned to Rae. 

“Well,” he said, “I asked them 
to get Mary Marne, but I suppose 
one human female looks like an- 
other to them. Or maybe my de- 
scription wasn’t so good.” 

“Sorry.” 

“Oh, that’s all right,” said Brab- 
ant. He beckoned to her. “Over 
here. You’re next.” 

¥T wasn’t the most attractive in- 
vitation Rae Wensley had 
ever had, but there wasn’t any 
choice. She sat where he ordered 
her. 

“Let’s see,” he said thoughtful- 



ly, glancing at the six silent aliens. 
“I guess we’ll start you off with 
knee jerks. Put these on, Rae.” He 
handed her a set of earphones and 
bent to tie something with a wire 
attached to her knee. “Easy,” he 
protested as she jerked away. 
“This is science.” 

Self-consciously, Rae put the 
earphones on. He was bright and 
cheerful enough, she thought an- 
grily. How could he? An hour be- 
fore, he was being called the worst 
name in the vocabulary of the hu- 
man race — a traitor to humanity 
itself — and now he might have 
been back on Explorer II, light- 
years from the nearest solid body, 
giving her the regular psychologi- 
cal check. 

“I thought,” he said chattily, 
“that we were going to have to 
hear Jaroff’s entire life history 
among the Gormen, second by sec- 
ond. Thank heaven they got tired.” 
He nodded toward the silent 
watchers. 

“What do you want me to do?” 
she asked coldly. 

“Why,” he said, “suit yourself. 
It doesn’t much matter; this is 
learning time, Rae.” He hesitated. 
“Come to think of it, yes, there is 
something I want you to do on the 
conscious level. The subconscious 
will take care of itself.” 

He slipped a reel onto the tape 
recorder. 

“Here,” he said, “is a reading of 
letters of the alphabet, read by 



42 



GALAXY 



me. They aren’t in A-B-C order 
but random, or as random as I 
could make them. What I intend 
to do with you is conditioning.” 

“How?” 

“The key sentence,”" he said, “is, 
‘Mary had a little lamb.’ I want 
you to respond to the letters in 
that sentence with a knee-jerk, not 
to any others. Simple? You’ll 
listen to my voice on the recorder, 
and every time I say one of the 
letters in that sentence, you’ll get 
a little patellar shock. Not much, 
but enough to make you twitch. 
It’s elementary enough — Pavlov 
was doing much more complicated 
things with dogs a long time ago. 
And what I want you to do is to 
repeat the letter you hear, out 
loud.” 

“I don’t like it.” 

Brabant grinned tightly. “This 
is orders from headquarters,” he 
said, and nodded at the six Gor- 
men. “But it won’t be painful. 
Now-” 

He turned the switch. 

The tape recorder obediently 
began to whisper the garbled al- 
phabet in her ear. 

“K. 

“Z. ... 

“R.” Brabant, listening on an- 
other set, pressed a switch. It was 
only a little tickling tingle. It 
startled the girl, but she had to 
admit that Brabant was right — it 
didn’t hurt It was, if anything, 
even less painful than the tap of 



a doctor’s rubber mallet; but it 
served the same purpose. The toe 
of her crossed leg involuntarily 
twitched an inch and a half. 

“Good girl,” Brabant applauded 
quickly, as the tape continued to 
spin. 

“D,” she heard in the earphones. 
Shock. Again the quick involun- 
tary twitch. 

“S . 

“U . 

“M.” Shock. 

It went on like that for a good 
many minutes. Then there was a 
quick squealing sound from one 
of the Gormen. 

Brabant snapped the switch. 

“All right,” he said, suddenly 
morose, “the peanut gallery is get- 
ting tired of this particular enter- 
tainment. We’ll do more of this 
some other time. Right now—” he 
hesitated again. “Right now, I 
think we’d better put you under. 
Lean back, Rae.” 

“Hypnosis?” She was startled 
and fearful. “But— wait a minute! 
I don’t like-” 

“Easy,” he soothed. “I give you 
my word, nothing’s going to hap- 
pen. It’s just the same sort of 
thing Jaroff was doing, that’s all. 
So relax, Rae. Relax and rest. 
Your eyes are getting heavy . .” 

T>AE Wensley swam up out of 
a confused dream. “All right, 
girl,” Brabant was saying, “time to 
wake up. It’s all over.”

She sat up quickly, staring 
around, her mind chaotic. Five of 
the Gormen were gone; the sixth, 
or perhaps it was a totally new 
one, stood idly near them, patient- 
ly waiting. 

“Let’s go,” said Brabant. “You’re 
through for the day. I want to 
get back to the others.” 

Rae pulled herself together and 
went out of the room with Brab- 
ant, stooping slightly to avoid the 
lintel of the door. She was con- 
fused, full of puzzlement, and odd- 
ly tired. Hypnosis was nothing new 
to her; it was one of the tools of 
Brabant’s trade. But she won- 
dered what the purpose of the 
demonstration had been . what 
the silent watching Gormen had 
made of it . and, most of all, 
what was going on in Brabant’s 
mind. 

“All right, we’re ready,” said 
Brabant to one of the Gormen be- 
low, and the creature glided si- 
lently close to them, dogging them 
out of the building and across the 
square toward the human jail . 
or cage. It was a gray day, damp 
and hot. 

Brabant said, glancing at the 
girl: “Thanks. You did fine.” 
“What did I do?” 

He grinned. “Well,” he said, 
guiding her across the threshold of 
the Gorman headquarters, “you 
are helping me prove a point. You 
see, the Gormen don’t have any 
subconscious.” 



Rae asked stiffly: “So?” 

“So they’re a very different 
breed indeed, Rae. There isn’t 
anything that sinks down into the 
Gorman almost-forgotten, and then 
turns up as a neurosis, or tic, or 
deja vu. A Gorman doesn’t say: 
‘It’s on the tip of my tongue, but 
I can’t quite get it out.’ It’s al- 
ways there for him.” 

“Is that why you told Hibsen 
they were better than we are?” 
“In that sense, yes, they are. 
Without a subconscious, they don’t 
have most of the other trappings 
that go with a multi-layered mind. 
They respond fast because there’s 
nothing to get in their way. They 
don’t have a psychic censor. There 
isn’t an5Tthing in their minds that 
interrupts the thought-and-action 
sequence. They don’t question, 
they don’t doubt, they aren’t built 
to do an3dhing like that. If they 
knew a thing, they know it; if they 
don’t, they just find it out. Oh, 
they’re curious — that, my dear, is 
why we’re still alive.” 

“Thank heaven for that much,” 
said the girl, and frowned. “Then 
does that have something to do 
with the way their ships are 
built?” 

Brabant nodded. ‘We need com- 
puters for rocket piloting — we 
aren’t fast enough to make the 
split-second, always-right little de- 
cisions that mean the difference 
between a routine landing and a 
gory explosion. Computers are fast

enough to handle the load. And so 
are these boys. I’d say,” he went 
on earnestly, “that if our friend 
here—” he nodded at the silent 
gray alien pacing them— “wanted 
to hop in that rocket right now 
and take off, he could do it, given 
about a minute to figure out the 
controls. Of course, someone would 
have to make sure the tanks were 
filled and so on — and if any- 
thing went wrong with the auto- 
matic mixers and the other stuff 
in the combustion system, he 
wouldn’t be any better at fixing 
them- than you or I. He isn’t 
smarter than we. 

“But he is faster,” said Brabant, 
and checked himself. 

"DEHIND them, soft footsteps 
^ were rapidly shuffling across 
the deserted square. Rae turned, 
and Brabant caught her hand. 

“Careful,” he warned, and she 
could see that he was worried. It 
was surprising, but almost pleas- 
urable; at least he wasn’t on total- 
ly easy terms with the Gormen! 
But Rae was worried too, at the 
same time; six Gormen were com- 
ing toward them at a sort of high- 
speed waddle, the shambling, dis- 
tance-devouring gait of the ele- 
phant in a hurry. The aliens 
passed Rae and Brabant by with- 
out a glance and disappeared into 
the jail. 

“Come on,” said Brabant ur- 
gently, and hurried after them. 



Their own Gorman guard easily 
kept pace with them, without the 
appearance of hurry and without 
a sound. They reached the door 
and looked inside . 

Mary Marne knelt bent over 
her baby, asleep in a crude plaited 
cradle de Jouvenel had made. She 
looked up, sprang to her feet. 

Twittering faintly to each other, 
two of the Gormen grabbed her. 

Mary gasped with fear. “Please!” 
she moaned, but they held her 
fast, and another Gorman’s squat 
hands reached out for her. Snap, 
snap; it opened the fasteners of 
her blouse; skillfully, almost cruel- 
ly, it slid the zipper of her shorts. 
It was assault; it was like a crude 
and perverted rape; the three of 
them, nothing like human, disrob- 
ing the blonde Earth girl — it was 
a tradition of literature; and, for 
Mary Marne, it was terror and 
shame. They stripped her naked 
as a newborn in less time than 
Rae, standing helplessly by, could 
believe; and they poked her, 
palpated her, prodded her and 
scrutinized every pore. 

The Crescenzi children began 
to scream, and Mary’s husband 
heard. He came running from the 
back room. 

“Sweet heaven!” he yelled and, 
hardly pausing at the door, threw 
himself on the Gormen. But fast 
as he was, the Gormen were suf- 
ficiently faster — more than suf- 
ficiently; he didn’t have a chance.

They were between him and his 
writhing wife before he was 
through the door; there were six 
of them, and though three were 
busy with Mary, the other three 
were more than enough to handle 
Marne, and Rae Wensley, and the 
others who came racing into the 
room. Marne shouted frantic oaths; 



they had as much effect as his 
fists and teeth. 

Rae felt Brabant grab her, draw 
her back. “Marne!” he yelled. “Get 
a grip on yourself, man! They’re 
not hurting Mary!” 

Marne screamed incoherently. 
He kicked futilely at the alien who 
had him, sobbed, and glared at

Brabant. “You rat! What the devil 
do you mean, they’re not — ” 

And then he stopped, panting 
for breath. He saw it was true, 
or true enough. Shame her, dis- 
comfort her, strip her naked for 
everyone to see — yes, all of those 
things; but that was the extent 
of the menace in what the Gormen

did. They were like children with 
a kitten. They poked and felt and 
flexed, but if they gave pain, it was 
not for the sake of the pain, but an 
accident of curiosity. 

M arne bellowed: “Mary, are 
you all right?” 

The girl suddenly relaxed. “I—

I think so. It’s kind of — ouch, 
they pinch — embarrassing. But I 
don’t think they’re going to — to 
kill me or ansdhing.” 

Marne howled without words. 
But it was only his husbandly 
pride and anger now; it was clear 
that the Gormen’s purpose, for the 
moment at least, was limited to 
examination. 

Brabant said: “Thafs better, 
Marne. I rather thought that 
sooner or later they would want 
a good look at the comparative 
anatomy of the female of the spe- 
cies. Though I didn’t think it 
would be quite so public.” 

Marne cried hoarsely: “Damn 
you, Brabant! Which side are you 
on?” 

Brabant only nodded, his ex- 
pression opaque and suddenly ab- 
sent-minded, like a man not 
bothering to hear something that 
doesn’t really matter. “I only came 
around to pick out another sub- 
ject for my own little studies. Let’s ■ 
see,” he said, looking casually 
around the room. “I think I’d bet- 
ter take—” 

But he didn’t get to say, just 
then, who it was he had selected. 
The Gormen finished with the per- 
son of Mary Marne. They set her 
down on her feet — not roughly, 
not gently, merely quickly — and 
returned her clothes. Then, ignor- 
ing her, they twittered briefly at 
each other and started without 
pause for her baby. 



It was the first time a human 
had ever caught a Gorman off 
guard. 

The little knot of men, already 
on edge, didn’t stop to think or 
argue. They jumped, without warn- 
ing. And the first Gorman was 
bowled over before he could raise 
his stubby hands to protect him- 
self. There was a loud, shrill twit- 
tering from all the aliens, the 
most noise Rae had ever heard 
them make, and roars of sudden 
rage and triumph from the men. 
The other Gormen, the ones not 
immediately involved, reached 
quickly into pouches in their thick 
skins — for what, Rae could only 
guess, but the guess was frighten- 
ing. It might have been death and 
devastation right then, if those 
stubby hands had come out with 
guns — 

B rabant shouted frantically: 
“Wait, you fools! Hold it! 
They won’t hurt the baby! They 
only want to examine it!” 

Maybe it wouldn’t have stopped 
the men, but it slowed them down. 
The Gormen needed no more. 

The alien that had been hurled 
to the floor bounced up again like 
a ball; the others knotted together, 
poised. 

The men drew back. 

The brief rebellion was over. 
But all the humans stood there, 
eyes burning with anger, while 
the Gormen picked the child up.

stripped it as quickly and efficient- 
ly as they had its mother. 

The baby screamed. Well, 
babies do scream when they are 
awakened suddenly; it doesn’t 
mean pain, only surprise. And in- 
deed the aliens were oddly gentle 
with him. Where they had left 
purplish bruises on Mary’s pale 
skin, they were tender with the in- 
fant. 

Aliens, monsters, call them 
whatever you like, Rae Wensley 
thought, it was clear that they 
knew the difference between an 
adult and a newborn. 

It took very little time; then 
he was back in his plaited crib, 
still naked but no longer crying 
very much, and the Gormen, with 
a few twitters among themselves, 
were gone. 

The atmosphere around Dr. 
Brabant had turned ugly. 

He didn’t seem to notice. He 
was staring thoughtfully at a blank 
wall, as though all of this were 
really not happening, as though he 
were pondering ink-blots in a 
study back on Earth. He seemed 
preoccupied, Rae thought, and 
somehow faintly pleased. 

But all he said at last was: 
“Well, so much for that. Mean- 
while, I’ve got work to do for our 
friends. Oh, one thing. You aren’t 
restricted to this place any more. 
You can wander around outside 
if you like — though you’ll have 
company, of course.” 



S EVERAL light-seconds away, 
and getting farther all the 
time. Captain Serrell hung at the 
conn-room periscope, watching the 
tangled cocoon of steel cable that 
linked the trailer to its tractor. 

Steel is elastic. In free-fall, the 
stretched cables had a tendency 
to snap back, not much, but 
enough to start the nine-hundred- 
foot tractor and the larger, lighter 
trailer moving slowly back toward 
each other, kinking the cables, 
bringing the radioactive reactor 
nozzles dangerously close. 

“Take it easy, Lanny!” the cap- 
tain ordered impatiently. “You’re 
getting too damned close to the hot 
zone!” 

Young Lanny, aggrieved, said 
over the radio: “Sorry, Captain.” 
But he had known perfectly well 
what he was doing. Captain Ser- 
rell, through the periscope, watched 
the spacesuited boy swing his 
pusher around and ease the pon- 
derous mass out again, toward the 
limit of its tether. His very posture 
showed annoyed dignity. 

Captain Serrell sighed and 
cranked the periscope around again 
to look at Aleph Four. His nerves 
were on edge. Lanny Davis was a 
good boy — man, the captain cor- 
rected himself; Lanny was twen- 
ty-one now. He had been only 
twelve when Explorer II began to 
swim slowly away from its orbit 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



49 



around the orbiting Earth, un- 
tangling its nearly Ptolemaic web 
of cycles and epicycles by craft 
and immaculate navigation as it 
set course for the star system that 
included the habitable satellite, 
Aleph Four. But now he was a 
man, and Explorer II circled 
Aleph’s primary itself. 

It was a singularly helpless feel- 
ing, Captain Serrell told himself, 
scanning the featureless clouds, to 
be drawing farther and farther 
away from his two scout rockets 
down there. It couldn’t be helped. 
Explorer didn’t have the massive 
thrust it would have needed to 
risk an orbit around the satellite 
itself, or even around Aleph, the 
Jupiter-sized planet that was first 
out from its primary. 

Too crowded, too many bodies 
clutching at the weak tractor-trail- 
er combination. If incautiously 
they had blundered too close to 
one of them, that might have been 
the end for the whole ship. And 
therefore, doubtless, of the colony, 
for without the vast stores aboard 
the mother ship, yet to be ferried 
down, the colonists would have 
terribly rough going. 

And what, Serrell asked himself, 
do they have now? 

TTE kicked back to his desk, 
pulled himself into his seat, 
made a mark on his calendar with 
a tethered pencil. Four days. No 
word. No radio. No returning 



rocket. And Explorer spinning 
hourly farther away. 

What in the name of heaven 
was going on? 

The microphone on his desk 
buzzed. “Captain Serrell, naviga- 
tion room.” 

He snapped a switch. “What is 
it?” 

The voice from the navigation 
room said doubtfully: “Captain, 
we hooked up a photo-cell trig- 
ger system with the scanning 
scopes, to look for rocket exhausts, 
just like you said. And it went off 
a couple of seconds ago. Andy’s 
tracking down the tapes now.” 

Serrell’s heart gave an enor- 
mous leap. Rocket exhausts! If the 
alarm had spotted rocket exhausts, 
it would mean — it had to mean! 
— that at least one of the scouts 
was on its way back! 

“Hurry up!” he yelled, past car- 
ing that he was giving superfluous 
orders; the news was too good to 
wait. “How long’s it going to take? 
I’ve got Aleph Four in the peri- 
scope now— think I can see them?” 

“Well,” said the voice, puzzling- 
ly worried, and faded away. Then 
it came back, stronger and — more 
worried. 

“No, Captain,” apologized the 
voice from the navigation room, 
“I’m afraid you can’t. Andy’s got 
the tapes now. The rockets — well, 
they aren’t coming from Aleph 
Four, Captain. They’re coming 
from the other planet, Bes.”

l^OWN below, Hibsen tested 
his freedom. He nodded to 
de Jouvenel, who got up and fol- 
lowed him out the door. “Let’s see 
how far we can go. Suppose we 
take a look aroundsthe rocket, for 
a starter.” 

“All right.” But that was a lit- 
tle more than they were allowed. 
Two Gormen swooped silently 
after them, and though Hibsen 
and de Jouvenel walked rapidly 
enough, the Gormen were at the 
rocket before them, solid chunks 
of gray flesh barring the port. 

Hibsen said: “Okay, we’ll try 
something else. Let’s wander off. 
Maybe only one of them will fol- 
low. Then we can split up and—” 

But both Gormen followed. The 
two men walked over the softly 
bouncing paving, turned a corner, 
walked a few squares, turned 
again. The rocket was out of sight: 
the sound of the Gormen moving 
about, their voices, their machines, 
had all faded. Apart from their 
own muted footsteps and a faint 
whisper of motion from the trail- 
ing Gormen, the world was empty 
of sound. 

“Split,” whispered Hibsen harsh- 
ly, and obediently the little dark 
man chose a street at random and 
disappeared into it. The Gormen 
split too, one after de Jouvenel, 
one trailing Hibsen. 

Hibsen rubbed his star sapphire 
angrily. The confounded things, if 
only they’d get rough, shout, show 



anger, act human. But they weren’t 
human, and perhaps they showed 
it most in the utter dispassionate 
coolness of their surveillance. 
They didn’t seem to care how far 
their charges led them. They didn’t 
object to what must obviously be 
an attempt to lose them. 

They only followed. 

“Then follow, damn you!” Hib- 
sen whispered, and lengthened his 
stride. 

When Hibsen strolled, the Gor- 
man strolled. When Hibsen moved 
faster, the Gorman, tied to an in- 
visible, inelastic string, moved ex- 
actly as fast, stayed exactly as 
close. 

Hibsen, anger seething in him, 
began to rim. The Gorman — no, 
not ran — but shuffled faster, as 
fast as Hibsen, an even five yards 
behind, no matter how Hibsen 
forced his wearying legs and strug- 
gled for every burning breath. He 
broke into a dead gallop and kept 
it up for two hundred yards — and 
the Gorman stayed that same five 
yards behind. 

And when Hibsen flung himself, 
heart pounding, lungs agonized, to 
the ground, the Gorman stood 
stock-still above him. And, with- 
out pausing to catch a breath, 
made notes. 

Hibsen lay there, sobbing. It 
was infuriating and humiliating, 
but he made himself do it. He lay 
there at the alien’s feet, face to the 
ground, only one eye open just 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



51 



enough to gauge the creature’s 
mood and stance. 

Then, without warning, he flung 
himself up and at the gray shape. 

No warning — or none that Hib- 
sen himself could measure, but 
there must have been some, for 
the Gorman was ready. Some in- 
significant tightening of a muscle, 
something hardly noticeable, but 
enough. Before Hibsen was fully 
on his feet, the Gorman had put 
his metallic “notebook” in the 
fleshy pouch that might have been 
skin and might have been a gar- 
ment, and before Hibsen had quite 
turned to face him, the Gorman’s 
arms were cocked like a boxer’s. 
Too late, too late, Hibsen sobbed 
silently, but he flung himself on 
the alien anyway — and was 
knocked across the sidewalk. 

It was as easy as that. 

All the way back to their com- 
mon jail, Hibsen clutched his ach- 
ing face and swore to himself. He 
didn’t look around. He didn’t have 
to. He knew what was there. He 
knew it was always going to be 
there, as long as they were on this 
planet, and maybe Brabant was 
right: maybe — in some ways, at 
least — the Gormen were better 
men than the humans were. 

VIII 

"O AE Wensley sat restive in 
Brabanfs laboratory, waiting 
for Brabant to get to her. At the 



moment, he was busily conferring 
with one of the Gormen — the 
old one, the one that seemed to be 
in charge of Keeping an Eye on 
Brabant. She was glad for the 
chance to sit and watch Brabant, 
for there were many questions in 
her mind about him. But she 
couldn’t sit still all the same. 

Too much was happening. 

Brabant had deliberately cut 
himself off from contact with the 
rest of the humans. There was no 
other explanation. She had tried 
to talk to him and he wouldn’t 
talk. She had tried to defend him, 
but Devil’s Advocate is a thank- 
less job when the Dev — when 
Brabant wouldn’t lift a finger in 
his own defense. She had no reason 
to defend him, no reason at all to 
care. 

But how worn and haggard he 
looked! 

He came over to her at last 
and said shortly: “All right, Rae, 
let’s get going. Same as before. Put 
on the earphones.” 

“Again? We’ve done this fifty 
times—” 

“And we’ll do it fifty more if I 
say so! Hurry up, Rae.” 

Stiffly she sat down, not look- 
ing at him. It was a wearisome, 
nonsensical business! How childish 
of him to carry on with it — and 
how childish of the Gormen to 
continue to be interested. Or 
amused. Or whatever it was they 
were that made them go on watch- 



52 



GALAXY 



ing and taking their interminable 
notes. True, Brabant did have the 
wit to vary the procedure from 
day to day, so that sometimes she 
was asked to repeat the letters 
she heard aloud, sometimes to 
write them, sometimes merely to 
sit and listen, and suffer the mild 
electric tingle of the band on her 
knee. But it had been some days 
since he had bothered to give her 
shocks. 

“Today,” he said, “I’ve got a 
treat for you.” She looked at him 
warily. “I want you to repeat 
every letter you hear, and I’ll let 
you watch your foot.” 

Rae looked away hotly. 

“You understand?” he de- 
manded. 

“Certainly I understand.” She 
had, after all, a higher I.Q. than a 
rhesus monkey, and those had 
been given similar tests, she knew; 
Brabant had told her that. 

“Right,” he beamed. “You hear 
an A, you say A. That’s all.” He 
seemed almost happy. Happy! 
Everything he did, she thought 
miserably, was an affront. 

Perhaps it was only the de- 
tached attitude of the scientist, she 
told herself, but without convic- 
tion. And in any case, as Brabant 
had not failed to remind her — 
often — there wasn’t any choice. 
If the trained seals wanted fish, 
they would have to snort out Yan- 
kee Doodle on the pipes. 

Rae sat somnolently in her 



chair, watching her own toe, as 
the tape began to whisper in her 
ear. “A,” it said, and “A,” she re- 
peated obediently, while the toe 
danced ah inch. 

“Good enough,” said Brabant, 
nodding. “Now we lower the vol- 
ume. Keep going, Rae.” 

“All right.” 

^I'HE little voice in her ear whis- 
pered fainter and fainter. It 
began to be hard to hear. She for- 
got her toe, staring into space, 
straining to get it right. “R . 
L . D — no. T, I think.” 

“Just say the first letter that 
comes to you!” he ordered impa- 
tiently. 

“But-” 

“Do as I say! If you aren’t sme, 
guess!” 

“All right.” She was angry now. 
“Y ... A ... P - oh! Thafs 
funny!” Quickly her mind scanned 
the sentence: Mary had a little 
lamb. There was no P in the 
sentence. i 

But her foot had twitched. 

“I told you,” Brabant crowed. 
She stared. He was looking, not 
at her, but at the Gorman, which 
made rapid notes. 

“What — what’s going on? Did 
the conditioning blow a gasket?” 
He told her with self-satisfac- 
tion: “Not at all.” 

“But that last letter was a P 
and-” 

“It was a B. You were sure. 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



53 



but you were wrong! Consciously 
you heard P; that’s what you said. 
But your subconscious — it was 
sure, too, only it was right. Your 
subconscious hears better than the 
front of your mind, Rae.” 

She said worriedly: “I don’t 
know what that proves.” 

“It proves,” said Brabant, “the 
existence of the subconscious — 
which hears with its own ear, sees 
with its own eye — and is not 
disturbed by the errors of the con- 
scious mind.” 

“Proves it to me, to you, or to 
the Gormen?” she asked. 

“Why, to all of us,” he answered 
enthusiastically. “Can’t you realize 
what a challenge it is to have to 
demonstrate the existence and 
functions of a subconscious to a 
race that doesn’t have any? The 
concept doesn’t mean a thing to 
them. All they can understand is 
proof, concrete proof, as tangible 
as it can possibly be. And with 
them checking me every inch of 
the way — Lord, what an oppor- 
tunity! Don’t you see?” 

She stared at him. 

Weeks and weeks of this — not 
merely the tape-recorder chant- 
ing the alphabet, but hypnosis, 
deep recall, heaven knew what; 
not only for her, but for nearly 
every member of the human party. 
And for what? 

She said tightly, furiously: 
“What do you think you’re do- 
ing?” Her own voice surprised her. 



It rasped with harsh emotion. 

It surprised Brabant, too. “But 
I’ve already told you.” 

She said: “Look at that thing! 
Ifs taking everything in, every- 
thing you can give it — more than 
they could hope to learn in a dozen 
years, starting from scratch! Brab- 
ant, don’t you know what the Gor- 
men are going to do with the 
knowledge you give them?” 

The alien made a slight move- 
ment. Brabant looked at it and 
shook his head. Then he turned 
back to the girl. 

“Why, yes,” he said, “I sup- 
pose I do.” 

“They want it to-” 

“You don’t have to tell me. 
They want to use it to conquer 
Earth.” He grinned self-conscious- 
ly. “As the old psychiatry joke put 
it — that’s their problem.” 

^HE couldn’t help herself; the 
instant she was back with the 
others she told them, every word. 
It was like trying to vomit up a 
poison, cast it out, get rid of it, 
but merely saying it didn’t get it 
out of her system; it continued to 
stay inside her and burn. 

“Council of war,” said Hibsen 
dangerously. “Mary, you and the 
kids stay here.” 

They trooped into one of the 
back rooms, the silent Gorman at 
the door remaining uncaring be- 
hind. Hibsen, grim-faced, laid the 
proposition before the house: “He 



54 



GALAXY 



has no right to live.” Hibsen muted 
his voice with a powerful effort. 
His jaw was still painful, but he 
was past caring about that, though 
it hurt him especially much to 
talk. “Brabant’s gone over to the 
Gormen — he admits it! Treason 
is a capital crime. Brabant’s got 
to die.” 

Rae listened through a fog of 
weariness. She had been up with 
the children that morning; she had 
gone through a grueling hour with 
a demanding Brabant and a stolid, 
worrisome Gorman; and she had 
felt terror inside her when Brab- 
ant admitted he knew what the 
Gormen planned. It had been a 
wearing day, but, more than that, 
there was a pain and anger inside 
her more than she could bear. 

This was Brabant they were 
talking about. Brabant, whom she 
loved — or had once loved — or 
wished to love, if only things could 
be smoothed out so that it was just 
the two of them. Love is many 
things; it is a biological call and 
also a gestalt of social attitudes 
and standings; and whatever the 
biology between them might have 
been, however fine and good, or 
crushing and destroying, it was 
the certain fact that every person 
in that room but her wanted to 
see Brabant dead. 

Every person but her? 

But she was the one who had 
brought them the one bit of evi- 
dence they needed. And what did 



she want? Rae looked around the 
room at the others, hotly arguing 
in undertones. They were a queer 
lot, she thought regretfully; it was 
hardly fair that eight billions of 
mankind on the rich and teeming 
Earth should depend for their fu- 
ture security on what action this 
handful of people here might take 
to muzzle one person across the 
square. 

In spite of the Qualifying Tests, 
in spite of Brabant’s care, those 
who voyaged between the stars 
were likely to develop strange can- 
cers of the personality. Half the 
people in the room, she counted, 
had been up and down like yo- 
yos during the voyage — manic, 
and then tranquilized; depressive, 
and then stimulated. Chemistry 
did it — part of it; Brabant, with 
his tests and his therapy, did the 
rest. 

But now they were going to kill 
Brabant, weren’t they? And may- 
be, she thought wearily, there was 
something to think about there. 
Brabant had kept them all in one 
piece ... 

But who had kept Brabant from 
chaos? 

TV OT herself, she thought, ach- 

’ ing, though she had been 
more than willing. (But Brabant 
had explained that to her, tender- 
ly enough. He couldn’t. Alone 
among the ship, he couldn’t be- 
come emotionally involved. He 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



55 



couldn’t make close friends, even, 
not until the trip was over; to do 
so would destroy his usefulness.) 

And now it was too late, of 
course, because they had already 
passed sentence. The decision was 
to execute. The problem was only 
one of ways and means. 

“Not a chance,” Hibsen was 
saying. “You can’t get him alone 
to do it, de Jouvenel. He wouldn’t 
trust you or me. Marne?” 

The lieutenant rubbed his 
splinted arm. “All right.” 

“Do you think you can manage 
it?” Marne grunted. “Good 
enough,” said Hibsen, satisfied. 
“Then all we need is a weapon. 
Who’s got anything we can use?” 
Silence for a moment. Then, 
slowly, Rae Wensley felt herself 
raising h^r hand. 

Hibsen started. “You, Rae?” 
“It’s sewing scissors, really,” .she 
said faintly. “But sharp.” 

Hibsen grinned with lean ap- 
proval. Almost she saw tufts of 
hair at the tips of his ears and 
needle teeth dripping saliva. Un- 
doubtedly it was giving Hibsen a 
lot of pleasure to hear her volun- 
teer to help remove the man she 
had turned him down for. 

But de Jouvenel said abrupt- 
ly: “Never mind, Rae. I’ve got the 
real thing.” They looked at him. 
The little dark man said without 
emphasis: “I was here before most 
of you. I had an idea something 
like this would come up. So . 



Anyway, it’s my own knife, and 
right at the moment it’s under the 
Marne baby’s mattress.” 

Rae stared. She had wondered 
why the little man had been so 
solicitous of the child. The plaited 
cradle was his; many times he had 
helped her change the bedding, 
pet the baby to sleep, and for what 
warped and lethal reasons, she was 
just now able to know. But at 
least, she thought with gratitude, 
it would not be her weapon that 
killed Brabant. 

TJIBSEN said: “That’s good. 

Fine. Now how do we work 
it? Rae, it never occurred to me 
that you’d help, because — Never 
mind. Since you’re willing, may- 
be you can help get him alone 
with Marne. Got any ideas on how 
we can arrange that?” 

She stood numbly, trying to 
think. Ideas? Oh, she was full of 
ideas, but not the sort Hibsen had 
in mind. Her ideas were pictures 
and memories and dreams, and 
she had to leaf them over in her 
mind — now — because soon they 
would be gone, or spoiled. 

Marne said, scratching his jaw: 
“How about this? I’ll wait upstairs. 
Rae tells him she wants to talk 
to him or something — maybe acts 
a little affectionate, you know? 
And then I’ll be waiting. We can 
tell the Gormen we were fighting 
over her. Maybe that will confuse 
them a little. We owe it to Earth 



56 



GALAXY 



to try to mix them up as much 
as we can.” 

He was discussing the thing 
quite reasonably, she thought in 
frozen distress, like a man plan- 
ning an evening of bridge rather 
than a prospective murder. No, 
execution. That was the word, 
since they had calmly and reason- 
ably passed sentence. It was all 
very reasonable, she thought 
drearily; there wasn’t any point at 
which a person could stop and cry 
out: This is all wrong! You’re pro- 
posing to destroy a human life! 

Hibsen was saying: “The Gor- 
men will take it hard, of course, 
so maybe Marne’s idea is a good 
one. But let’s not kid ourselves. 
They won’t be easy to fool. But 
we’ll have to face that when we 
come to it. I don’t think they’ll 
do anything about hostages or re- 
prisals — they don’t seem to think 
along those lines. Still, Brabant is 
the only person who has estab- 
lished real contact with them, and 
we ought to consider what they’re 
likely to—” 

From the other room, Mary 
Marne warned: “Watch it! They’re 
coming!” 

¥N came a party of Gormen, six 
of them, armed, moving along 
like iceskaters, without fuss or 
noise. And with them was Dr. 
Brabant. 

Rae stepped back involuntarily. 
Brabant had been harried and 



worn, on the edge of desperation, 
that afternoon; now he had passed 
the edge. His face was sallow. His 
hands twitched. His eyes were the 
eyes of crucified Christ; but what 
he said could have come only from 
the lips of Judas. In a voice of 
torment, he said: “You’ll have to 
give your plan up. Sorry, but the 
Gormen and I know what you’re 
up to, and they won’t let you.” 

Silently, the aliens fanned out, 
surrounding the humans, forcing 
them toward the front room. 

Brabant said: “Those of you 
who have managed to keep weap- 
ons, you’ll have to turn them over 
now.” 

And he knew where to look. 
They went into the room where 
the children were sleeping and 
turned back the thin soggy mat- 
tress under the baby, and there 
was de Jouvenel’s knife. 

“Rae,” said Brabant command- 
ingly, and two of the Gormen ad- 
vanced toward her. 

“Never mind,” she said hastily, 
and fumbled in her clothes for 
the sewing scissors. 

Brabant accepted them and 
passed them to one of the aliens. 

He looked around. “That’s it,” 
he said at last, still in that torn 
and inwardly raging tone. 

He didn’t look at Rae, but he 
met the eyes of the others easily 
enough. 

“From now on,” he said, “there 
won’t be any more chances for

any of you — either to kill me 
or to escape. Sorry,” he added po- 
litely, “but that’s the way it is. 
We’re leaving here.” 

“What the devil are you talk- 
ing about?” Hibsen demanded, his 
voice cracking. 

“We’re leaving in two days,” 
said Brabant, nodding slightly, like 
a professor glad a student has 
asked a question that helps him 
to move a discussion along. “The 
Gormen have been waiting for a 
big ship that will hold all of us. 
It’s on its way. They’re going to 
take us — I don’t know where, ul- 
timately. Maybe Bes. Maybe 
farther. But the first stop, I think, 
is Explorer II.” 

He paused, in the sudden abso- 
lute stillness. “Yes,” he said 
thoughtfully, “thafs what they’re 
going to do . Rae.” 

She jumped. 

“Will you come outside with me 
for a moment?” 

She glanced instinctively at 
Hibsen for orders — then quickly 
away. That was cruel. Conspiring 
to execute Brabant was one thing, 
but asking another man’s permis- 
sion to walk with him was, some- 
how, worse. 

For reasons she couldn’t have 
elucidated and didn’t stop to think 
out, she said: “All right.” 

^T^HEY went out into the street, 
she and Brabant and the Gor- 
men. Brabant said, oddly diffi- 

58 



dent: “Let’s go for a walk.” 

“A walk?” 

He nodded, avoiding her eyes. 
They were never allowed to walk 
outside at night. 

“With one of them for a 
chaperon?” 

Brabant shook his head, and, 
true enough, all of the Gormen 
were moving away, swiftly and 
without a backward glance. 

“Ah,” she said, suddenly en- 
raged, “I see! You betray your 
companions, and your payoff is a 
longer leash to your collar. I sup- 
pose it’s worth it!” 

“Rae.” 

His voice was dull, not beg- 
ging, hardly even protesting, but 
she wouldn’t listen. She shrugged 
and walked slowly down the street. 
The darkness was nearly absolute. 
It was impossible to see even the 
outlines of the buildings ahead, 
but she could see lights behind 
them from the human quarters. 

When she could no longer make 
out Brabant’s face, she said: “All 
right, we’re walking. What do you 
want?” 

“A fair break,” Brabant said im- 
mediately. 

‘‘You tool!” 

“No, wait! I—” But the time 
had passed, if ever there had been 
a time. Rae couldn’t stand it. No, 
she told herself, agonized, this is 
wrong. And she turned and ran 
headlong back through the dark 
streets. 



GALAXY 



Out of nowhere, a Gorman ma- 
terialized to follow her. 

Brabant hesitated. 

He glanced at the vague silhou- 
ette of the remaining Gorman — 
out of earshot but, he had always 
known, not out of sight. No, they 
didn’t trust him that much. He 
squared his shoulders and returned 
— not to the house where the 
others were quartered, of course; 
not even to his laboratory, where 
he had been permitted to sleep for 
a while, but to a thin pad on an 
upper floor of the Gorman bar- 
racks. He had been sleeping there 
for three nights now, on orders, 
and he didn’t like it. It represented 
a deterioration in his relationship 
with the Gormen. 

If things went on this way, he 
thought wildly, he wouldn’t have 
a friend in either camp. 

A ND time passed, and time 
passed. Rae went through the 
hours without seeing faces or hear- 
ing words. Brabant came and went, 
more tired every time, more re- 
mote, selecting his guinea pigs 
with a jerk of a thumb, and the 
Gormen who were with him al- 
ways now obligingly formed guard 
and marched his chosen subjects 
away. Rae found it impossible to 
sleep. Merely to try was punish- 
ment, for the moment the head 
went down and the eyes closed, 
then tears started. But time 
passed. 



“You, Rae,” said Brabant’s 
voice, and she looked up, startled; 
she had been sitting staring at the 
Marne baby and had somehow 
managed to attain that total empti- 
ness called Nirvana. “You come 
along. And Hibsen and de Jou- 
venel, I have a special treat for 
all of you.” 

Hibsen said six words, one a 
preposition and the other five ob- 
scene. 

“Yes, I know,” said Brabant re- 
motely. “Come along.” 

He marched off, not looking 
back. He didn’t have to see if they 
were following; the Gormen were 
there for that. He marched his 
subjects across the square and to 
the base of the hidden Gorman 
rocket. 

“I want,” he said, “to show you 
what you’re up against. In you 
go.” 

He glanced at them. Their ex- 
pressions were amusingly sur- 
prised, though no one on all that 
planet, just then, was amused. 

“It’s all right,” said Brabant. 
“I’ve got permission from the Gor- 
men. We’ll have company, never 
fear. But they don’t really need 
to watch us. That’s what I want 
you to see.” 

De Jouvenel trailed him, and 
the girl and Hibsen followed. Hib- 
sen said flatly: “I’d kill you if I 
could. You know that.” 

Brabant nodded. It wasn’t worth 
an answer, it was so obviously

59 



true. “Here,” he said, “this is the 
control roorn. Sit down, Hibsen.” 

“In that?” Hibsen was honestly- 
shocked. 

“Or stand if you like. But look 
around.” 

Hibsen forgot to be murderous. 
His eyes were wide open for the 
first time in days; his curiosity 
had mastered him. He looked 
about him like a child in story- 
land. Hibsen was a pilot of space- 
ships, and not even the blinding 
hatred he bore for Brabant could 
keep him from being interested in 
a strange ship built by a strange 
race. 

A spaceship is the simplest of 
machines. You push something out 
of one end, the ship squirts away 
in the opposite direction, that’s all. 
No moving parts (in schematic 
design), no complications, no pos- 
sible variations of construction, no 
matter by whom designed or 
where. How can there be, as an 
analogy, more than one way to go 
Up? 

That’s the theory. The prac- 
tice . 

TTIBSEN’S heart shriveled in 
him. He found himself caress- 
ing the star sapphire, rubbing an 
unsure finger over the gold braid. 
This was the ship he and de Jou- 
venel had thought to steal. What 
Brabant had said was all too true. 

It was no more possible for a 
human to walk in and operate a 



ship like this than for a monkey 
to punch out a Shakespeare son- 
net by random thumping of a 
typewriter. 

De Jouvenel said faintly behind 
him, “Sweet heaven. There’s 
nothing here.” 

It was plain fact. There were, 
for example, no such things as: 
triple - gyro attitude indicator, 
linked through selsyn motors 
to a homeostatic negative-feed- 
back course corrector; self-com- 
pensating thrust control, capable 
of measuring the minute variations 
of squirt of each component in 
each mixing chamber and increas- 
ing or decreasing the flow of fuel 
appropriately; feedback - aligned 
course plotter, able to read a tape 
which dictated the parameters of 
all possible orbits which would 
take one from here to there, to se- 
lect the best of them, to put the 
ship on it and keep it there and 
to discard that orbit and select 
another, without pause or falter- 
ing, if for any reason of failure of 
parts, motion of objective, inter- 
position of obstacle (i.e., meteorite, 
astronomical body, other vessel) 
the chosen orbit became unsuit- 
able and it was necessary to 
change. 

There was, in other words, no 
smoothly humming Black Box. 
There was no compensator that 
could measure all of these things 
and balance them one against an- 
other. There was no standby cir- 



60 



GALAXY 



IX 



cuit to compensate for the ulti- 
mate failure of all, the failure of 
the compensator. 

There was, instead, only — 

Item: An artificial horizon. (It 
was a thin jet of mercury, imping- 
ing on a spider’s orb-web of wires 
marked in circles and radians, the 
whole reflected in a ninety-degree 
mirror into the pilot’s eyes.) 

Item: A porthole. Yes, a port- 
hole. A glassed-in nose cone to 
look out of. Radar, periscopes, 
photocell detectors? No. Nothing 
like that. 

And, item: Eight little rings, 
one to fit each of the eight fingers 
of a Gorman’s two hands, each 
one of which controlled the flow 
of fuel to one jet. 

There were those and there was 
nothing else. 

“You see?” demanded Brabant 
irritably. 

“I see,” said Hibsen after a 
pause, his hand clinging to the 
star sapphire. “I—” 

He stopped. There was nothing 
to say. “You want us to go now, 
Brabant?” 

“Not you,” said Brabant shortly. 
“Rae, de Jouvenel, you can go 
back. Hibsen I want to stay here. 
You’ve had your treat. Now I 
need you for a little more guinea- 
pigging. And,” he said over his 
shoulder, turning his back on all 
of them, “maybe now you’ll see 
the wisdom of my advice. Give up. 
It’s all over.” 



"OUT it wasn’t all over. Not 
really. There was one more 
act on the program, that program 
which Brabant had carefully con- 
trived in the silent hours watch- 
ing over the injured Lt Marne, 
just after the first landing. 

Brabant squatted on his thin, 
sour-smelling pad in the pre-dawn 
darkness, looking at a window that 
showed only the faintest difference 
in shade from the wall around it. 

In the past few days, the Gor- 
men had made it adequately clear 
that his work for them was just 
about at an end. What they wanted 
to know, they knew. The mine 
had been worked; the tailings were 
decreasingly valuable and soon 
they would decide to terminate 
the operation. At that point — 

There were other things the 
Gormen wanted to know about 
Earthmen than how their minds 
worked, and though they’d learned 
some of them from Jar off and the 
late Chapman, they would proceed 
as rapidly as possible to learn the 
rest. The psyche digested, the 
soma would be next to be studied. 
Equally thoroughly. And with a 
great deal more carelessly dis- 
tributed pain. 

Dr. Brabant felt sick and empty 
inside. 

It wasn’t only the reasonable 
prospect of laboratory-animal dis- 
section that worried him. It was 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



61 



something more. It was the knowl- 
edge that if all the humans died, 
all but one of them would die 
hating him. 

Brabant did not enjoy being 
hated. 

In his profession, the position 
was not imfamiliar. Brabant’s job 
was to keep the mind in balance, 
and in the process of adjustment, 
a great deal of free-floating hatred 
clung to the psychologist in charge. 
(So did love.) He had made him- 
self apart and — more or less — 
independent of the temporary 
emotional states of those around 
him; that was the way the job was 
done. 

But now he was utterly, utterly, 
completely alone. On all this 
planet, there was not one soul 
who loved, respected or trusted 
him, not even the orphaned Cres- 
cenzi children, who had taken to 
running and hiding from him when 
he came near. 

Brabant sighed, and then, ab- 
ruptly, sat tensely erect. 

There was a subdued twitter- 
ing and motion on the floor below. 
Brabant frowned. What he knew 
of the Gormen more than any- 
thing else was that they were re- 
liably creatures of habit; it was 
not their habit to arise before full 
light. He listened carefully, but 
there was nothing to hear that 
did him any good, only the fact 
that, for some reason, the barracks 
was early awake. Gradually he re- 



laxed, but without ceasing to 
frown ... he seldom ceased to 
frown anyhow, these days. 

He thought wistfully of the rest 
of the party, huddled together in 
the building across the square, 
hardly a hundred yards away. At 
least they had each other. Though 
it was his job to keep them stable, 
and though in the course of it he 
learned more about their weak- 
nesses, faults and subdued internal 
evils than most of them knew 
themselves, Brabant liked — loved 
— no, needed them; needed their 
regard and their warmth. They 
were his friends. They were all he 
had. 

' I ^IME was when Brabant, new 
at the job, had dreamed with 
regret of the possible high-stabili- 
ty, non-neurotic personnel an in- 
terstellar flight might — should — 
enlist. But you had to take what 
you could get; that was the law. 
Brabant hadn’t made that law. Ac- 
tually, the law had been made by 
herbalists, ratified by surgery, and 
confirmed by Alexander Fleming 
and the pharmaceutical houses. 
Modern medicine, over a good 
many generations, had saved so 
many lives that it had enforced 
a general lowering of psychologi- 
cal standards in favor of some 
rather special physical ones. 

An Rh baby in a modern hos- 
pital was a trivial happenstance in 
a dull morning’s routine; on an 



62 



GALAXY 



alien planet, without endless blood 
of every conceivable type (not to 
mention accessories) the same 
happenstance was — a dead baby. 
Colonists could not afford, simply 
could not afford, to carry in their 
genes and chromosomes the risk of 
an Rh-negative response — or of 
sickle-cell anemia, hemophilia, 
agammaglobulinemia — you name 
it. 

Hardly a child was born on 
Earth that did not receive at least 
one tender flick of a scalpel — to 
correct a squint, tighten a ven- 
tricle, ease a pyloric stenosis or 
whatever — in its first months of 
life. On Aleph Four, that scalpel 
might not be there. Sure, a doctor 
or two went with each party, but 
if something happened to the doc- 
tor? The risk could not be borne. 

And so Part One of the Quali- 
fying Tests was a rigorous genetic 
study, and the passing grade was 
100%. And that eliminated very 
many of those who were willing 
to apply. The ones that were left 
had to be combed for— no, not the 
utterly stable; the utterly stable 
organism, being satisfied, stays 
where its roots are dug in — but 
for those nearest stable, or those 
who could be kept stable for the 
purposes of their job. 

Like Hibsen. Given the security 
he wore on his jacket and a job 
that he knew he could do, Hibsen 
was hard, bright, aggressive and 
able. Take those things away and 



Hibsen was something else again; 
but those things weren’t meant to 
be taken from him — wouldn’t 
have been, except for the Gor- 
men . 

And Brabant liked Hibsen. 

He liked them all — needed 
them — and, yes, loved them. 
Neurotic or not. Stable or not. 
With warmth toward Brabant him- 
self or not; and at that moment, 
he wryly knew, it most decidedly 
was not. 

A DISTANT metallic scream 
made him look up. It was 
daylight now, and the noise was 
coming from outside and up. 

Brabant jumped to his feet and 
pressed against the window, try- 
ing to see what was outside his 
field of view. Something was com- 
ing. The scream grew louder and 
louder; it thundered and blared. 

Light — flame — thrust down 
out of the clouds. 

“It’s here,” whispered Brabant, 
held to the window, staring; and 
he watched as the hugest of all 
imaginable ships dropped, flame- 
tailed, out of the clouds. 

It settled into the square out- 
side, next to the dismantled Ter- 
restrial scout, with a wash of fire 
that made Brabant avert his eyes 
and scorched the rock walls. It 
was a towering brute of a ship, 
more than two hundred feet tall 
— bigger than the trailer of Ex- 
plorer II, silently orbiting out in 



WHATEVER COUNTS 



63 



space — bigger than any vessel the 
human race had yet been able to 
transport from Sol to another star. 
In the Solar System itself, big 
ships were by no means xmcom- 
mon, but even there this one 
would have been a monster. It was 
all one piece, and that piece tow- 
ered higher than a twenty-story 
building. 

Brabant took his hands away 
from his eyes and squinted out 
at the giant. Gormen already were 
hurrying out to its base; that ex- 
plained, at least, why the barracks 
had arisen so early that morning. 
It was the ship they had been 
waiting for, the one big enough to 
carry all the humans to— wherever 
the Gormen proposed to take 
them. 

“All right,” Brabant whisf>ered 
crazily, dizzy with fatigue and 
shaking with nerves, “you’ve come. 
I hope I’m ready for you.” 

And before noon of that day, 
they were embarked. Brabant, for 
his services to the captors, had the 
job of straw boss. 

“Come on, come on,” he said 
tightly, looking at no one, “move 
along, get aboard.” And the hu- 
mans moved toward the ship, car- 
rying what they could. 

Hibsen and de Jouvenel, glow- 
ering, mumbled loud enough for 
Brabant to hear, but he wouldn’t 
look at them. Mary Marne and 
her husband came, carrying the 
child, Mary near to tears and the 




64 



child already howling. Petty and 
the two Crescenzi children, tear- 
streaked and clinging; Sam Jaroff, 
his eyes wide with horror like a 
man floating on a wide sea, who 
sees the rescuing vessel steam care- 
lessly away. And last of all Rae 
Wensley, and if Brabant didn’t 
meet her eyes, neither did she look 
at Dr. Howard Brabant. 

“Inside,” grumbled Brabant, fol- 
lowing along. 

One Gorman was with them, 
silent, motionless and armed. He 
was enough. The Gorman hand 
weapon was a rapid-fire flame 
ejector. In that confined space, he 
could easily kill every one of them 
before the first could quite make 
up his mind to move. 

The rest of the Gormen were 
busy with more important things 
— looting the scout rocket, carry- 
ing what probably were records 
and equipment from their head- 
quarters to the square. 

“Judas!” hissed de Jouvenel as 
he went by. 

Brabant did not turn. He was 
staring into space. 

TNSIDE the rocket, Rae Wens- 
ley leaned against a cold brassy 
bulkhead, half closing her eyes. 
The Gorman reek soured the air 
around her. They were in a bare 
chamber; whatever the Gormen 
themselves liked in the way of 
creature comforts, they had pro- 
vided nothing at all for their cap- 



tives. It looked like a long, im- 
comfortable trip. 

And the destination would be 
the worst part of it. 

Brabant glanced at the girl. She 
might have been sp>eaking aloud; 
every thought she had was writ- 
ten on her face. 

All right, Howard, he said to 
himself, what are you waiting for? 
Everybody was aboard. One Gor- 
man stood there and no others; if 
there was ever going to be a mo- 
ment, the moment was now. But 
he couldn’t help waiting a second, 
just another second, like a gam- 
bler with the rent money stand- 
ing hypnotized before the pari- 
mutuel window; the risk was great, 
and it was hard, hard to make 
himself go ahead . 

But something took over for 
him. 

Brabant found himself stand- 
ing next to the Gorman. He 
reached into his frayed blouse and 
took out the knife the Gormen 
had commandeered from Hibsen, 
that Brabant himself had com- 
mandeered from the Gormen. 

“Here,” he said. The alien 
looked at him and twittered, but 
accepted the knife. “And — oh, 
yes,” said Brabant, licking his lips, 
“I think they’ve got another. In 
the same place.” 

Twitter, twitter. Gorman-ac- 
cented English was hard to follow 
at best. 

“Yes,” nodded Brabant, “in the

same place, under the baby.” He 
closed his eyes for a second. 

When he looked up, the Gor- 
man was moving rapidly toward 
the baby, the knife in one hand, 
the other outstretched for the 
child. 

“Dear God,” cried Brabant, the 
words a prayer, “he’s going to kill 
the baby!” 

Kill the baby — kill the baby. 
The words rolled aroimd the metal 
chamber. Everything stopped. 

The Gorman half-turned, the 
expression almost humanly sur- 
prised, but it didn’t matter. There 
wasn’t a second’s hesitation; there 
was no time for thought. Marne 
leaped at the alien as quickly as 
any Gorman. It was reflex that 
moved him, not thinking. He was 
on top of the rhino before even 
that super-fast creature could 
whirl, and half a dozen of the 
others were right behind. 

The Gorman was out cold, un- 
der a himdred blows, before he 
could lift the knife; he never even 
started for the gun; that massive 
skull could endure pounding, but 
the brain beneath was subject to 
syncope like any human’s; he was 
unconscious. It was the second 
time the humans had surprised a 
Gorman, and the first when it had 
mattered. 

The fighters jumped back, tri- 
umphant and amazed. 

“We — we got him!” gasped 
Hibsen, unbelieving. 

68 



Brabant, weary but ready, dug 
into his worn pockets for the other 
essential ingredient of his plan. 

“Here!” he said, holding out a 
thin wire coil. “Tie him up, Hib- 
sen! De Jouvenel — close that 
port!” 

X 

HE bound Gorman lay on the 
floor, its eyes open; it had not 
stayed unconscious long. Outside 
scrabblings against the port said 
that the other Gormen were sus- 
picious. And Rae Wensley cried 
out: “Brabant! I thought you told 
me they wouldn’t hurt the baby!” 
Brabant was breathing ragged- 
ly; he looked utterly spent. But 
the hangdog expression was gone 
from his eyes, the crucified look 
from his face; he was almost tri- 
umphant. He said: “Thafs right, 
Rae. He was only searching for an- 
other knife.” 

“But-” 

“But I lied to you, yes! We 
need this ship. We couldn’t plan 
to jump him— nothing could make 
us do it fast enough; the second’s 
lag in our thinking would give 
him plenty of warning. So I had 
to make you attack him — with- 
out thinking — as fast as a Gor- 
man, and the only way I could 
make you do that was to see that 
you were pushed by reflex. Pro- 
tecting the young — that doesn’t 
have to filter through the con- 



G ALAXY 



scious; that makes you move; we 
saw that already. So—” 

“So now,” said Hibsen, raging, 
“we’ve won a battle and lost a 
war. What’s the use of all this, 
Brabant? We’ve got a ship, but 
we can’t fly it. You said so your- 
self — you proved it to us!” 

“No,” corrected Brabant, “I 
proved it to the Gormen. Wait. 
Listen.” 

Outside, there was a muffled 
clattering. The Crescenzi children 
began to whimper; they hadn’t had 
time to before. 

Brabant nodded absently. “The 
Gormen are getting ready to break 
in. This is an important ship, you 
see. It’s their biggest in this sys- 
tem, and the only one that’s 
armed.” 

“You — want us to destroy it?” 
Hibsen guessed. 

“I want to fly it up to Explorer.” 
“Without computers? But—” 
“But we have computers, Hib- 
sen,” said Brabant. “Three of them. 
You, and de Jouvenel, and Rae.” 
He had them, Brabant exulted 
wearily. A month of hatred could 
not be wiped out in a second, but 
he had managed a suspension of 
emotion. They were all waiting. 
They would give his plan a try. 

“Come along,” he said, nodding 
to the three of them, and climbed 
the rounded spikes that took them 
to the bare pilot’s room. 

The muffled outside clattering 
stopped and was replaced by a 



persistent, purposeful rasp, rasp. 
Time was flying. But there would 
be time; and either they would 
succeed or, as a bare minimum, 
there would be a good many dead 
Gormen around the base of a de- 
stroyed ship. 

“Sit down, Hibsen,” he ordered. 

The pilot looked at him, licked 
his lips, sat in the webwork chair. 
The straps and spring metal fitted 
themselves easily around his lean 
body; they were planned for a 
Gorman, but they would have 
fitted a skeleton as easily, for they 
were designed to fit whatever they 
were given to hold. 

“Rae, you and de Jouvenel lie 
down. Anywhere. These ships 
have plenty of power, according 
to Jaroff, so we won’t have to pile 
on too much G at first — but it 
won’t be comfortable.” 

TTE stretched himself on the 
bare floor near Hibsen and 
glanced around. The remote rasp, 
rasp was louder, but that menace 
would be at an end in a second. 

“Hibsen,” said Brabant conver- 
sationally, “you know how to oper- 
ate this ship. All right, take it off.” 

With a tranced expression, Hib- 
sen put his fingers into the Gor- 
man controls. 

He glanced at Brabant for re- 
assurance, sighed, licked his lips 
again, closed his eyes— 

Gently, his fingers moved in the 
rings.

Red roaring flame leaped out 
below them. 

Brabant found himself letting 
go, slumping, his rigid self-control 
no longer needed. It was all up to 
Hibsen now. If the thing worked, 
fine. If not, they were all dead. 
There were no other alternatives. 

The ship shook. It leaped a frac- 
tion of an inch and settled, leaped 
again, hesitated, and at last stood 
free of the soil of Aleph Four. 

Faintly, over the roar of the 
power plant, Brabant could hear 
Hibsen sobbing. Brabant glanced 
at him. Hibsen’s face was the face 
of a man in mortal terror; his 
mouth twisted and his eyes blinked 
with a rapid tic. 

But he was flying the ship. 

It did not crash. It hardly fal- 
tered. Every faint motion was 
translated instantly into a quick, 
gentle and sure manipulation of 
the rings. Hibsen’s eyes, open now, 
were fixed absently on the attitude 
jet of mercury, but it was his body 
as much as his eyes that told him 
what he needed to know; the 
forces that might tug the ship off 
its center of gravity tugged also 
at the tiny otoliths in his ear and 
he felt a change of attitude as soon 
as it happened, before it mattered. 
There was no loss of control, not 
even for a fraction of a second. 
The ship gained all its ponderous 
power and began to climb. 

(Down below, thirty Gormen 
lay dead and a score more dying. 



It no longer mattered — their ship 
was gone; whatever might happen, 
that ship had got away.) 

Grinding heels of acceleration 
crushed Brabant and all of them. 

Even so, Hibsen’s control did 
not waver. The others sat or lay 
while the floor and the webwork 
chairs heaved against them, but 
Hibsen kept the ship secure — 
up — up and out, up and out — 
In three minutes, they were 
clear of the atmosphere. The great 
primary burned at them. Stars 
flamed in a black sky. There were 
no more clouds and no more air. 
And Hibsen, shaking himself like 
a man coming out of a dream, cut 
the power by withdrawing his fin- 
gers from the rings. 

“We — did it,” he whispered, 
staring at his hands. “Brabant. 
How?” 

13RABANT moved from the 
floor and floated free. All the 
weight was gone from him — not 
merely the hundred and seventy 
pounds of his flesh and bone, but 
the greater weight that had been 
on his mind. He was free! Almost, 
like Hibsen, he sang. 

Instead, he said: “Take a look 
below, de Jouvenel. See how the 
others made out.” 

The little dark man, looking 
horribly confused, propelled him- 
self to the rounded spikes and 
down. Hibsen and the girl were 
looking at Brabant and their eyes 



70 



GALAXY 



were large with questions, but just 
at this moment Brabant couldn’t 
answer questions. He didn’t trust 
his voice. 

All the weeks of painfully dem- 
onstrating the simple truths of 
psychology before the impassive 
Gormen, and the carefully planned 
conditioning that underlay those 
weeks as a secret message lies un- 
der a printed page — they had 
paid off. What the subconscious 
mind could always do — act! with- 
out delay! — he had made them do 
then. The days in the Gorman 
building, the scant hours he had 
had for the finishing touches, yes- 
terday, in the Gorman ship— these 
had been enough. They were free. 

He tried to tell them. 

“But,” said Hibsen, “but . .” 
And he paused. He said fretfully: 
“But you betrayed us!” 

“No,” said Brabant, “I only kept 
you out of trouble. You didn’t have 
a chance with your plans of catch- 
ing the Gormen off guard and I 
couldn’t afford to let you fail. One 
failure was too many and—” 

“But you could have told me, 
Howard,” the girl objected, hurt. 

Brabant looked at her. “I’m sor- 
ry,” he said after a moment. 

“Oh, no! You don’t have to 
apologize! But — we wronged you. 
I more than anyone else, I sup- 
pose, because I should have 
known.” 

Brabant said: “I couldn’t tell 
you. That building was bugged; 



there was no word that any of 
you said, ever, that they didn’t 
hear. But even if they hadn’t, how 
could I risk getting you overcon- 
fident? My plan wasn’t that sure 
of working, believe me.” 

De Jouvenel floated up out of 
the hatch, asprawl, catching at a 
spike and missing. “They’re all 
all right, Brabant,” he said, upside 
down. 

“Then let’s get out of here! I 
want to get back to Explorer II 
right away — before anything goes 
wrong.” 

De Jouvenel said patiently: 
“But we don’t have its coordi- 
nates.” 

“You do,” said Brabant. “You’re 
the navigator. You put it in orbit.” 
“But — good Lord, Brabant! I 
can’t remember—” 

“Trance state, please. Now.” 
The little man tensed slightly. 
No glassy look to his eyes, no 
melodramatic flopping to the floor 
— nor would there have been even 
if they had not been in free-fall. 

r|E Jouvenel frowned. He caught 
absently at a corner of Hib- 
sen’s webwork seat as he floated 
past and moored himself. He was 
thinking. 

The question had been asked: 
What were the coordinates of Ex- 
plorer II’s present position? To 
answer it involved knowing its 
exact speed and distance from the 
primary at the time of entering

free-fall, the perturbations of Aleph 
and its satellites, the smaller, more 
remote perturbations of every 
other astronomical body within a 
certain mass-over-distance param- 
eter. It was not a question that de 
Jouvenel could answer. Certainly 
not. 

But the mind that slept under 
the skin of de Jouvenel woke to 
answer for him, the mind that re- 
ceived all and forgot nothing, the 
sleeping subconscious mind that is 
in every human. That mind re- 
membered every digit of every 
number it had conceived — it 
counted pulse-beats when it had 
to, measured the intervals between 
sunset and sunset, though its own- 
er took no notice. 

It was, in a word, a computer. 

De Jouvenel writhed and 
strained, and — abruptly— spouted 
a string of course coordinates. It 
was an amazing experience for 
him. He found his own mouth, in 
his own voice, answering Brabant’s 
question. It was the queerest of 
all sensations for him; it was like 
nothing that had ever happened to 
him before. The numbers meant 
nothing to him. He would have 
sworn, and believed it to be true, 
that he had forgotten every datum 
and that the numbers were ran- 
dom, wrong. 

But something inside him had 
never forgotten, and the numbers 
were not wrong. With Hibsen’s 
help, they became a course and 



gently, surely, the captured rocket 
swung into orbit after the mother 
ship. 

Less than two hours later, they 
were decelerating gently, and the 
long swinging bolo that was Ex- 
plorer II’s tractor and trailer lay 
waiting in the emptiness before 
them. 

Brabant clung to Rae, soft and 
silent next to him, and his thoughts 
were all triumph. The questions 
that had yet to be answered were 
beyond counting. What were the 
Gormen doing on Aleph Four? 
Was it rockets alone that carried 
them on interstellar flight? What 
were their objectives in attacking 
the human race? Was peace pos- 
sible, or an armed truce? 

But all those questions had an 
answer, somewhere, sometime, and 
by their bringing to Earth a Gor- 
man ship, armed with Gorman 
arms, surely someone would be 
able to deduce the answers they 
needed. It was only a matter of 
going now. Give them a chance 
to build Up speed, and no vessel, 
Gorman or other, could catch them, 
and they had that chance. The 
little Gorman craft on Aleph Four 
could do them no harm, and Bes 
was too far away. 

"D AE Wensley stirred contented- 
ly in his arm, then straight- 
ened. “Howard, what are they do- 
ing?” 

She was looking at Explorer II.

Before their eyes, the long kinked 
tow line began to straighten; a 
thin violet haze was spraying back 
from the tractor. 

“Why — ” Brabant laughed. 
“They’re trying to get away!” 

They could see the periscopes 
on their side of the trailer, fixed 
rigidly on the Gorman rocket. Al- 
most they could see Captain Ser- 
rell’s anxious face as he watched 



this strange craft floating in on 
him. 

Brabant said with a gentle grin: 
“Hibsen, better stick your ugly 
mug out in that port and wave to 
him. Put yourself in the captain’s 
place — he waits and waits, and 
when somebody finally shows up, 
it’s a Gorman ship. He’s going to 
need some reassurance!”

FORECAST 

With readers' instructions in, and our overwhelmed thanks to the 
literally thousands who gave them to us, we have as clear a battle strategy 
as ever a magazine rode into the circulation war with. 

Two-part book-length serials are wanted; they will be coming off the 
drawing boards before long, and into crash-priority production. Until they 
do, the sizable minority against them can enjoy the succession of complete 
issues — and we hope they won't desert when the majority wish is fulfilled ! 

Novellas and novelets — no change ordered. 

Short stories — now that we know more are desired, because they can 
be read in a break at office or lab or factory or home, we'll sent out patrols 
and scouting parties to bring them in alive, very much alive. 

Science department — more variety wanted, will do; more speculation, 
will do; readers' questions reinstated, will do if, and only if, you write in. 

Book review department — only change clearly ordered by the majority 
is greater coverage; paperbacks, as you'll note in this issue, are now being 
briefly reviewed. We have another innovation in mind for the next issue that 
may make the "shopping list," as one reader put it and very many others 
later agreed, still more helpful. Let us know then if it is, please. 

Editorials — will do, but lighter, heavier, "only when you have some- 
thing to say," or "confined to doings about the magazine" — conflicting 
orders, as you can see, but we'll turn ourselves inside out trying to comply. 
How's the one in this issue? If you have anything to add or argue about, 
come on, chum, share it with us ! 

Letter department — at least half are willing to try it, but are waiting 
for the next guy to write in. Well, who'll be first? 

Better cover stock — will do, but we had to use up the supply on hand. 

Thanks for the enormous turnout. Write soon and often, will you?

D own from the streets 
(morning air already gray 
and bitter with motor ex- 
haust and industrial fumes), into 
the jampacked subway he passed. 
His clothes, though mildly incon- 
gruous in that unhappy throng, 
brought him no special measure of 
attention. Weary, wary, cynical, 
grim, displeasured indifference ly- 
ing on each countenance like an 
oily film, the folk stared not so 
much at him as over and through 
him. 

He fought to keep his feet, strug- 
gled to maintain his balance. This, 
merely the antechamber to every- 
day existence, was difficult enough. 
Add to it the need to be constantly 
on the lookout for the Wooden In- 
dian Society and he felt he had 
reason to be tense and jumpy. 
“Benedict, a leading modern free- 
form sculptor in wood—” Ha! 

Twice he had been aware that 
they had tailed him as far as Times 
Square. Twice he had lost them. A 
third time— 

The man in the faintly funny- 
looking clothes (his name was Don 
Benedict, but some called him 
“Dusty”) paused for a minute un- 
der one of the red-lettered wooden 
signs, took a quick look at the 
paper in his hand (more, it almost 
seemed, to reassure himself that 
it was still there than to scan the 
contents), did an about-face and 
started back the way he had come. 
By and by he came to a stairway 



TAKE WOODEN INDIANS 



75 



which he ascended for five steps, 
then turned around and went down. 
At the bottom — 

At the bottom of it all was El- 
well, and Elwell was dead: not 
from the cough which had been 
tearing him apart for years, but 
dead of a slippery little patch of 
ice no bigger than a man’s hand. 
Elwell, dying, with blood in the 
corners of his mouth, holding Don’s 
hand in a grip which the yoimger 
man could feel the heat going out 
of. 

“But it belongs to the WIS,” Don 
had protested. 

And Elwell: “No, Don, no — it 
belongs to me. I formed it. I proved 
it.” 

“They’ll never allow—” 

With a desperate, slow intensity, 
shaking his head, Elwell had ex- 
plained. Reluctantly, Don agreed. 
It seemed to him that he was agree- 
ing to no more than the first risk. 
But then, with Elwell dead, and 
the WIS turning against them both 
— first with coldness, then with 
clamor, then with a silent tenacity 
more disturbing than either — Don 
Benedict came to see that it was 
not only the beginning which was 
his, but that it was all his. Forever- 
more. 

A t the bottom of the stairs, he 
saw the man out of the corner 
of his eye, eye intent upon feet, 
feet pacing out the pattern. He 
stopped for a moment, intending 



only to turn. And stayed stopped. 
The man (it was Anders) took 
hold of his arm as if to urge him on. 

“I’m coming with you, Benedict.” 
Eyes burning, voice iron-hard. 

“I’m going alone.” 

“You’ve betrayed the trust, used 
what belongs to all of us, used it 
for yourself alone. The WIS—” 

As always, so now, the Wooden 
Indian Society undoing them- 
selves: Anders, trembling with fu- 
ry, unawarely released his grip. 
Don placed the cushion of his palm 
under Ander’s chin, thrust forward 
and upward with all his strength. 
And at once, swift — but not for- 
getting himself, not breaking into 
a run — he finished what he had to 
do. Anders staggered back, arms 
flailing, feet failing at purchase; 
then Don, turning his head at the 
last, saw him fall, the electric lights 
glaring on the white-tiled walls. 

His foot jarred, as always, miss- 
ing the familiar flooring by an 
inch. He adjusted his gait to the 
flagstone pave of the alley. It 
stretched before him and behind 
him for twenty feet in either direc- 
tion. There was no one in sight. 

About halfway along, there was 
a deep recess, a bricked-up door, 
and here Don hid until he was 
quite sure that Anders was not 
coming through. There was never 
any certainty that the WIS had not 
pieced it together, spying — some- 
how — pieced it together, bit by 
bit. There was always that tension.

even here — though less, much less. 
After all, if they did get through, it 
would no longer be him that they 
were primarily after. It would be 
Demuth’s. And Demuth’s could 
look out for themselves. 

Waiting, ears alert, he recalled 
the last meeting of the WIS he had 
dared attend. Mac Donald, eyes 
blazing deep in their sockets, had 
broken into Derwentwater’s meas- 
ured phrases, thrust a shaking fin- 
ger into Don’s face. 

“Do you call yourself a Preser- 
vationist? Yes or no? Stand up and 
be counted!” 

Staunchly, he had faced him, had 
answered. “I consider myself a phi- 
losophical Preservationist. I do not 
believe in violent—” 

Face convulsed, fists clenched in 
the air, “Traitor! Traitor!” Mac 
Donald had screamed. 

Not yielding, Don started to 
speak, got no further than Elwell’s 
name, when Mac Donald — and 
Anders, Gumpert, De Giovanetti, 
almost all of them, in fact — had 
drowned him out with their outcry, 
their threats. How much had De- 
muth’s paid him? How much had 
he sold out for? 

Demuth’s! Don mouthed the 
name scornfully. As if he would 
touch their tainted money. He had 
learned, the hard way, that Elwell 
was right all along, that the WIS 
were fanatics who would shrink 
from nothing. Well, he wasn’t doing 
any shrinking, either. 



■pkON Benedict came out of the 
niche — Anders wasn’t going 
to get through this time, that was 
clear — and walked on down the 
alley. In less than a minute, he 
came out into a courtyard where 
heaps of chips and sawdust lay on 
one side and heaps of hay on the 
other. A man in dung-smeared 
boots came out of the building to 
the left with a bucket of milk in 
his hand. He paused, squinted, 
tugged his tobacco-stained beard 
and put down the bucket. 

“Hey, Dusty! Glad to see you,” 
he greeted the newcomer. “You 
yust get into town?” 

“Ee-yup,” said Don Dusty. “How 
you. Swan?” 

Swan said he was fine, and in- 
quired about things up in Saira- 
cuse. 

“Capital,” said Dusty. “Hay’s 
bringing a fine price—” 

Swan groaned, spat into the saw- 
dust. “Good for dem, maybe. Not 
for me. I tink you been at de bot- 
tle, hey. Dusty? You look yumpy, 
like always, ven you yust come in.” 
“Bottle? I get little enough out 
of any bottle I buy. My damned 
brother-in-law” (it was true — he 
had forgotten about Walter; it 
would be nice if he never had to 
remember) “drinks my liquor, 
smokes my cigars, wears my shirts, 
and spends my money.” 

Swan groaned sympathetically, 
picked up the bucket. “Vy don’t 
you kick him de hell out?”

Nice advice, would be a pleasure 
to take it. Of course, Mary wouldn’t 
be able to stand it. Poor rabbity 
Mary. 

“All I need is to get back to 
work. That’ll fix me up.” Don/ 
Dusty waved, continued on his way 
across the yard and went into the 
doorway of the tall brick building 
to the right. Inside, it was cool and 
dark and smelled of wood and 
paint. 

Dusty took a deep breath and 
began to smile. 

He started up the stairs, ignor- 
ing the painted hand with out- 
stretched finger and word Office on 
the first floor. By the time he 
reached the second floor, his smile 
was very broad. Softly, he began 
to sing “Aura Lee” and went in 
through the open door. 

The big loft was dark; little 
light came in through the small and 
dirty windows, but at regular inter- 
vals a gas-jet flared. Dusty paused 
to greet his friends. Silently they 
stared down at him, peering from 
underneath the hands shading their 
eyes, stretching out their arms in 
wordless welcome, plumage blaz- 
ing in a frenzy of colors. 

“Hello, there, Tecumseh! How, 
Princess Redwing! Osceola, Poca- 
hontas—” 

A red-faced little man in a long 
striped apron trotted out into view, 
two tufts of snowy hair decorating 
his cheeks, a hat of folded news- 
print on his head. 



“Dusty, Dusty, I’m darned glad 
to see you!” he exclaimed. 

“Hello, Charley Voles. How’s 
everything at C. P. Hennaberry’s?” 

C HARLEY shook his head. 

“Good and bad,” he said. “Good 
and bad. Oscar snagged his hand 
on a nail moving some plunder at 
heme and it festered up something 
terrible. We was feared it was 
going to mortify at first, but I guess 
he’s on the mend at last. Can’t 
work, though, no-o-o-o, can’t work. 
And Hennery was too numerous 
with the drink, fell off the wagon 
again and I think he must still be 
in the Bridewell, unless’n may- 
be his sentence is up today. Mean- 
while, the work is piling high. Thun- 
deration, yes— fly-figures, rosebuds, 
pompeys, two Turks under or- 
ders—” 

“Two?” Dusty paused with his 
arms half out of his coat sleeves, 
whistled. 

Charley nodded proudly. “Gent 
in Chicago opening up a big em- 
porium, two Turks and two Sir 
Walters. Only thing is—” his ruddy 
little face clouded — “gent is clam- 
oring for delivery, says if he don’t 
get ’em soon he’ll order from De- 
troit. And you know what that 
means. Dusty: Let trade get away 
and it never comes back. Why, the 
poor Major is pulling his whiskers 
out worrying. ’Course, with you 
back in town—” 

Dusty, tying his apron, pursed

his lips. “Well, now, Charley— now 
you know, I never did fancy my 
work much on the special figures. I 
want to help Major Hennaberry all 
I can, but—” He shook his head 
doubtfully and started to lay out 
his tools. 

Charley Voles tut-tutted. “Oscar 
and Hennery was working on the 
Turks when they was took sick or 
drunk. 1 had the top three of a Sir 
Walter done, but I had to leave off 
to handle a couple of prior orders 
on sachems. Now if you’ll take on 
the sachems, I can finish the spe- 
cials. How’s that strike you?” 

Dusty said it struck him fine. He 
strode over to the hydraulic eleva- 
tor shaft and gave two piercing 
whistles. 

“Boy!” he shouted. “Boy! Ben- 
ny?” 

A treble from the office floor in- 
quired if that was him, Mr. Dusty, 
and said it would be right up. A 
noise of gasping and stomping from 
below indicated that someone else 
would be right up, too. 

“I want some breakfast, Benny,” 
Dusty said, tossing him a coin. 
“Here’s a quarter of a dollar. Get 
me the usual — eggs, pancakes, 
sausages, toast, coffee and crullers. 
Get some beer for Mr. Voles. And 
you can keep the change. Hello, 
Major Hennaberry!” 

The elevator cage surged slowly 
into view. First came Major Hen- 
naberry’s bald spot, then his cus- 
tard-colored eyes, magenta nose 

TAKE WOODEN INDIANS 



and cheeks, pepper-and-salt whis- 
kers, and, gradually, the Major 
himself, breathing noisily. In his 
hand he held a booklet of some sort. 

^ LOWLY and sybillantly, the 
^ Major moved forward, shook 
Dusty’s hand. 

“Don’t know what’s come over 
the American mechanic nowadays,” 
he said at last, asthmatically. “Can’t 
seem to keep himself safe, sober, or 
in the city limits, and acts as if 
Hell has let out for noon. Got 
some lovely white pine for you, my 
boy, fresh up from the spar yards. 
Don’t waste a minute — soon’s you 
get outside of your victuals, com- 
mence work. Draw on the cashier 
if you want anything in advance of 
wages: a dollar, two dollars, even 
a half-eagle. 

“Never had so many orders nor 
so few men to execute them since 
starting in business,” the Major 
wheezed on. “Even had Rat Nolan 
on picket duty for me, combing 
South Street and the Bowery — of- 
fered him three dollars apiece for 
any carvers he could find. Nothing, 
couldn’t find a one. It’s the catalog 
that’s done the boom, my lad. The 
power of advertising. Here — read 
it whilst you eat; be pleased to have 
your opinion.” 

Hissing and panting, he made 
his way back to the elevator, 
jerked the rope twice, slowly sank 
from sight. 

Dusty turned to the old artisan.

“Charley,” he said, slowly, as if he 
hadn’t quite determined his words, 
“hear anything about Demuth’s?” 
Charley made a face. “What 
would you want to hear about that 
ugly, pushy outfit?” 

Changing, somewhat, his point 
of inquiry. Dusty asked, “Well, 
now, have you ever thought about 
the significance of the wooden In- 
dian in American history?” 

The old man scratched the left 
fluff of whisker. “By crimus, that’s 
a high-toned sentence,” he said, 
rather dubiously. “Hmm. Well, all’s 
I can tell you — history, hey? — the 
steam engine was the makings of 
the show-figure trade, tobacco shop 
or otherwise. Certainly. All us old- 
timers got our start down on South 
Street, carving figureheads for sail- 
ing craft. That was about the time 
old Hennaberry got his major’s 
commission in the Mercantile 
Zouaves— you know, guarding New 
York City from the Mexicans. Yes, 
sir. But when steam come in, figure- 
heads went out. Well, ’twasn’t the 
end of the world.” 

And he described how he and his 
fellow-artists had put their talents 
at the disposal of the show-figure 
trade, up to then a rather haphaz- 
ard commerce. “History, hey? Well, 
I have had the idea it’s sort of odd 
that as the live Indian gets scarcer, 
the wooden ones gets numerouser. 
But how come you to ask, Dusty?” 
Carefully choosing his words, 
Dusty asked Charley to imagine a 

80 



time in the far-off future when 
wooden Indians — show figures of 
any sort — were no longer being 
carved. 

Had, in fact, suffered for so long 
a universal neglect that they had 
become quite rare. That gradually 
interest in the sachems revived, 
that men began to collect them as 
if they had been ancient marble 
statues, began to study all that 
could be learned about them. 

That some of these collectors, 
calling themselves the Wooden 
Indian Society, had been consumed 
with grief at the thought of the 
debacle which overtook the figures 
they had grown to love. Had 
claimed to see in the decline and 
death of this native art a dividing 
line in American history. 

f?|T was like, Charley, it was Hke 

-•-this was the end of the old 
times altogether,” Don went on, 
“the end of the Good Old Days, 
the final defeat of native crafts and 
native integrity by the new, evil 
forces of industrialism. And they 
thought about this and it turned 
them bitter and they began to 
brood. Until finally they began to 
plan how they could undo what had 
been done. They believed that if 
they could travel from their time 
to — to our time, like traveling from 
here to, say, Brooklyn—” 

How much of this could Charley 
grasp? Perhaps better not to have 
tried. 



GALAXY 



Don/Dusty spoke more rapidly. 
“That if they could reach this time 
period, they could preserve the 
wooden Indian from destruction. 
And then the great change for the 
worse would never occur. The old 
days and the old ways would re- 
main xmchanged, or at least change 
slowly.” 

“You mean they got this idea that 
if they could change what hap- 
pened to the wooden Indians, they 
could maybe change the course of 
American history?” 

Dusty nodded. 

Charley laughed. “Well, they 
were really crazy — I mean they 
would be, if there was to be such 
people, wouldn’t they? Because 
there ain’t no way—” 

Dusty blinked. Then his face 
cleared. “No, of course there isn’t. 
It was just a moody dark thought 
. Ah, here comes Ben with my 
breakfast.” 

Charley lifted his beer off the 
laden tray, gestured his thanks, 
drank, put down the glass with a 
loud “Hah” of satisfaction. Then a 
sudden thought creased his face. 
“Now leave me ask you this. Dus- 
ty. Just what could ever happen to 
destroy such a well-established 
and necessary business as the show- 
figure business? Hmm?” 

Dusty said that these people 
from the Wooden Indian Society, 
in this sort of dark thought he’d 
had, had looked into matters real 
thoroughly. And they came to be- 



lieve very deeply, very strongly, 
that the thing which killed the 
wooden Indian, and in so doing had 
changed American history so ter- 
ribly for the worst, had been the 
invention and marketing of an In- 
dian made of cast-iron or zinc. An 
Indian which would have no life, 
no soul, no heart, no grace — but 
which would never wear out or 
need to be replaced. 

And so it would sell — sell well 
enough to destroy the carvers’ 
craft — but would destroy the peo- 
ple’s love for the newer show fig- 
ures at the same time. 

Charley looked shocked. “Why, 
that’d be a terrible thing. Dusty 
— a thing which it’d cut a man to 
the heart! Cast-iron! Zinc! But I 
tell you what — if there ever was 
to be an outfit which’d do a thing 
like that, there’d be only one out- 
fit that would. Demuth’s. That’s 
who. Ain’t I right?” 

Dusty lowered his head. In a 
low, choked voice, he said, “You’re 
right.” 

r^USTY propped the catalog 
against a short piece of pine, 
read as he ate. 

“I don’t know what it is,” he 
said to old Charley, “but I have 
such an appetite here. I never eat 
breakfast at all when I’m—” He 
stopped, put a piece of sausage in 
his mouth, intently began to read. 

We would respectfully solicit

1 1 ’ HEY went upstairs after Dusty 
had finished his breakfast, 
pausing on the third (or second- 
hand figures) floor, to greet Otto 
and Larry. 

Young Larry was still consid- 
ered a learner and was not yet al- 
lowed to go beyond replacing arms, 
hands, noses, and other extra parts. 

Otto, to be sure, was a master 
carver, but Otto had several strikes 
against him. In his youth, in his 
native Tyrol, Otto had studied 
sacred iconography; in his matur- 
ity, in America, Otto had studied 
drinking. As a result, when he was 
mellow, unless he was carefully 
supervised, his Indians had a cer- 
tain saintly quality to them, which 
made purchasers feel somehow 
guilty. And when, on the other 



82 



GALAXY 



hand, Otto was sobering up, a defi- 
nite measure of apocalyptic horror 
invariably app>eared in his sachems 
which frightened buyers away. 

As a result, Otto was kept at 
doing extras — bundles of cigars, 
boxes of cigars, bundles of tobacco 
leaf, coils of tobacco leaf, twists of 
the same, knives, tomahawks, all 
to be held in the figures’ hands — 
and at equally safe tasks like strip- 
ping off old paint, sanding, repaint- 
ing, finishing. 

He nodded sadly, eyes blood- 
shot, to Dusty and Charley, as he 
applied ochre and vermillion to a 
war bonnet. “Ho, Chesus,” he 
groaned softly. 

Up in the woodloft, they made 
an inspection of the spars. “Now 
you needn’t pick the ones I started, 
of course,” Charley said. “Take 
fresh ones, if you like. ’Course, all’s 
I did was I drawn the outlines and 
just kind of chiseled ’em in. And 
put the holes in on top for the bolts.” 

Dusty stood back and squinted. 
“Oh, I guess they’ll be all right, 
Charley,” he said. “Well, let’s get 
’em downstairs.” 

This done, Charley went back to 
work on the Sir Walter, carefully 
chiseling Virginia Tobacco in bas- 
relief on the cloak. 

Dusty took up his axe and 
blocked out approximate spaces 
for the head, the body down to the 
waist, roughly indicated the divi- 
sion of the legs and feet. Then he 
inserted the iron bolt into the five- 



inch hole prepared for it, and tilted 
back the spar so that the projecting 
part of the bolt rested on a support. 
When he had finished head and 
trunk, he would elevate the lower 
part of the figure in the same way. 

Finally, finished with the block- 
ing out, he picked up mallet and 
chisel. 

“I now strike a blow for liberty,” 
he said. 

Smiling happily, he began to 
chip away. The song he sang was 
“Aura Lee.” 

T\ON/Dusty Benedict let himself 
into his studio quietly — but 
not quietly enough. The sharp 
sound of a chair grating on the floor 
told him that his brother-in-law 
was upstairs. In another second, 
Walter told him so himself in an 
accent more richly Southern, prob- 
ably, than when he had come North 
as a young boy. 

“We’re upstairs, Don.” 

“Thank you for the informa- 
tion,” Don muttered. 

“We’re upstairs, Don.” 

“Yes, Walter. All right. I’m com- 
ing.” 

Walter welcomed him with a 
snort. “Why the hell do you al- 
ways wear those damn cotton-pick- 
in’ clothes when you go away? Not 
that it matters. I only wish I could 
just take up and go whenever the 
spirit moves me. Where was it you 
went this time?” 

“Syracuse,” Don mumbled. 



TAKE WOODEN INDIANS 



83 



“Syracuse. America’s new vaca- 
tion land.” Walter laughed, not 
pleasantly. “Don, you really ex- 
pect me to believe you? Syracuse! 
Why not just say to me, frankly, 
‘I’ve got a woman’? That’s all. I 
wouldn’t say another word.” He 
poured himself several drams of 
Don’s Scotch. 

Not much you wouldn’t, Don 
thought. Aloud, “How are you, 
Mary?” His sister said that she 
was just fine, sighed, broke off the 
sigh almost at once, at her hus- 
band’s sour look. 

Walter said, “Roger Towns was 
up. Another sale for you, another 
commission for me. Believe me, I 
earned it — gave him a big talk on 
how the Museum of Modern Art 
was after your latest. So he asked 
me to use my influence. He’ll be 
back — he’ll take it. This rate, the 
Modern Art will be after you be- 
fore long.” 

Don privately thought this un- 
likely, though anything was pos- 
sible in this world of no values. He 
wasn’t a “modern, free-form” artist, 
or, for that matter, any kind of ar- 
tist at all. He was a craftsman — in 
a world which had no need for 
craftsmen. 

“But only—” another one of the 
many qualities which made Walter 
highly easy to get along without: 
Walter was a finger-jabber— “but 
only if you finish the damned thing. 
About time, isn’t it? I mean vaca- 
tions are fine, but the bills . .” 



Don said, “Well, my affairs are 
in good hands — namely, yours.” 
Walter reared back. “If that’s 
meant as a dig—! Listen, I can get 
something else to do any time I 
want. In fact, I’m looking into 
something else now that’s damned 
promising. Firm sells Canadian 
stocks. Went down to see them yes- 
terday. ‘You’re just the kind of 
man we’re interested in, Mr. Swift,’ 
they told me. ‘With your vast ex- 
perience and your knowledge of 
human nature. ’ ” 

^P7ALT scanned his brother-in- 
law’s face, defying him to show 
signs of the complete disbelief he 
must have known Don felt. Don 
had long since stopped pretending 
to respond to these lies. He only 
ignored them — only put up with 
Walt at all — for his sister’s sake. 
It was for her and the kids only 
that he ever came back. 

“I’d like a drink,” Don said, 
when Walt paused. 

Dinner was as dinner always 
was. Walt talked almost constantly, 
mostly about Walt. Don found his 
mind wandering again to the 
Wooden Indian Society. Derwent- 
water, ending every speech with 
“Delendo est Demuth’s!” Gumpert 
and his eternal “Just one stick of 
dynamite, Don, just one!” De Gio- 
vanetti growling, “Give us the 
Equation and we’ll do it ourselves!” 
Fools! They’d have to learn 
every name of those who had the

hideous metal Indian in mind, con- 
duct a massacre in Canal Street. 
Impossible. Absurd. 

No, Elwell had been right. Not 
knowing just how the Preserva- 
tionist work was to be done, he had 
nonetheless toiled for years to per- 
fect a means to do it. Only when his 
work was done did he learn the full 
measure of WIS intransigence. 
And, after learning, had turned to 
Don. 

“Take up the torch,” he pleaded. 
“Make each sachem such a labor 
of love that posterity cannot help 
but preserve it.” 

And Don had tried. The craft 
had been in him and struggling to 
get out all the time, and he’d never 
realized it! 

Slowly the sound of Walter’s 
voice grew more impossible to 
ignore. 

“. and you’ll need a new car, 
too. I can’t drive that heap much 
longer. It’s two years old, damn 
it!” 

“I’d like a drink,” Don said. 

By the time Edgar Feld ar- 
rived, unexpectedly, Don had had 
quite a few drinks. 

“I took the liberty not only of 
calling unheralded, but of bringing 
a friend, Mr. White,” the art dealer 
said. He was a well-kept little man. 
Mr. White was thin and mild. 

“Any friend of Edgar’s is some- 
one to be wary of,” Don said. 
“Getchu a drink?” 

Walt said he was sure they’d 



like to see the studio. There was 
plenty of time for drinks. 

“Time?” Don muttered. “Whad- 
dayu know about time?” 

“Just step this way,” Walt said 
loudly, giving his brother-in-law a 
deadly look. “We think, we rather 
think,” he said, taking the wraps 
off the huge piece, “of calling this 
the Gemini—” 

Don said genially that they had 
to call it something and that Gemi- 
ni (he supposed) sounded better 
than Diseased Kidney. 

Mr. White laughed. 

'C' DGAR Feld echoed the laugh, 
though not very heartily. “Mr. 
Benedict has the most modest, most 
deprecatory attitude toward his 
work of any modern artist — work- 
ing in wood or in any other 
medium.” 

Mr. White said that was very 
commendable. He asked Don if 
he’d like a cigar. 

“I would, indeed!” the modest 
artist assented. “Between cigarette 
smoke, gasoline and diesel fumes, 
the air is getting unfit to breathe 
nowadays. ... So Edgar is conning 
you into modern art, hey, Whitey?” 

“Ho, ho!” Edgar Feld chuckled 
hollowly. 

“Nothing better than a good ci- 
gar.” Don puffed his contentment. 

White said, with diffidence, that 
he was only just beginning to learn 
about modern art. “I used to col- 
lect Americana,” he explained. 



86 



GALAXY 



Edgar Feld declared that Mr. 
White had formerly had a collec- 
tion of wooden Indians. His tone 
indicated that, while this was not 
to be taken seriously, Open mock- 
ery was uncalled for. 

Don set down the glass he had 
brought along with him. No, White 
was hardly WIS material. He was 
safe. “Did you really? Any of Tom 
Millards, by any chance? Tom 
carved some pf the sweetest fly- 
figures ever made.” 

Mr. White’s face lit up. “Are 
you a wooden Indian buff, too?” he 
cried. “Why, yes, as a matter of 
fact, I had two of Millard’s fly- 
figures, and one of his pompeys— ” 
Walt guffawed. “What are fly- 
figures and pompeys?” 

“A fly-figure is a sachem with an 
outstretched arm,” Don said. “A 
pompey is a black boy.” 

“A rosebud,” Mr. White happily 
took up the theme, “is a squaw 
figure. A scout is one who’s shading 
his eyes with one hand. Tom Mil- 
lard, oh, yes! And I had some by 
John Cromwell, Nick Collins, 
Thomas V. Brooks, and Tom 
White — my namesake. Listen! 
Maybe you can tell me. Was Leo- 
pold Schwager a manufacturer or 
an artist?” 

Don Benedict laughed scorn- 
fully. “Leopold Schwager was a 
junk-dealer! Bought old figures for 
five, ten dollars, puttied and painted 
’em, sold ’em for twenty-five. 
Cobb!” he exclaimed suddenly. 

TAKE WOODEN INDIANS 



“You have any Cobbs, Mr. White?” 
“Cobb of Canal Street? No, I 
always wanted one, but—” 

Edgar Feld looked at Walter 
Swift, cleared his throat. “Now, 
Don-” 

“Cobb of Canal Street,” Don 
said loudly, “never used a mallet. 
No, sir. Drove the chisel with the 
palm of his hand. And then there 
was Charley Voles—” 

Feld raised his voice above 
Don’s. “Yes, we must talk about 
this fascinating though obsolete art 
sometime. Don’t you want to step 
a little closer to the Gemini, Mr. 
White?” 

“Yes, White, damn it, buy the 
damned Gemini so they’ll quit 
bothering us and we can get back 
to real art,” said Don. 

And forget about Walter, De- 
muth’s and the WIS, he said to 
himself. 

TV EXT morning, he tried to re- 
’ member what had happened 
after that. White had taken the 
shapeless mass of wood Walt 
called Gemini. (What would he 
tell Roger Down, the private col- 
lector? Some good, whopping lie, 
depend on it.) He was sure he 
remembered White with his check- 
book out. And then? A confused 
picture of White examining the 
polished surface, pointing at some- 
thing— 

Don Benedict badly wanted a 
cup of coffee. His room was just 

87 



off the studio, and once there had 
been a hot-plate there, but Walt 
had ordered it removed on the 
grounds of danger. So now Don had 
to go up to Walt’s apartment when 
he wanted a cup of coffee. That 
was how Walt liked everything to 
be: little brother coming to big 
brother. Well, there was no help for 
it. Don went upstairs, anticipating 
cold looks, curt remarks, at every 
step. 

However, Walt was sweetness 
itself this morning. The coffee was 
ready; Walt had poured it even 
before Don entered the kitchen. 
After he finished his cup (made 
from unboiled water, powdered cof- 
fee, ice-cold milk) Walt urged an- 
other on him. Rather than speak, 
he took it. 

Don knew, by the falsely jovial 
note of Walter’s voice, that Some- 
thing Was Up. He gulped the tepid 
slop and rose. “Thanks. See you 
later, Walter—” 

But Walter reached out his hand 
and took him by the arm. “Let’s 
talk about the Lost Dutchman 
Mine. (“The what?”) The Span- 
ish Treasure. (“I don’t—”) Spelled 
E-l-w-e-1-1,” said Walter, with an 
air at once sly and triumphant. 

Don sat down heavily. 

“Don’t know what I mean by 
those figures of speech? Odd. You 
did last night. Matter of fact, they 
were yours,” said Walter, mouth 
pursed with mean amusement. He 
would refresh Don’s memory. Last 



night, Mr. White had asked Don 
how he had come to have so much 
contemporary knowledge about 
the making of wooden Indians. Don 
had laughed. “An old prospector I 
befriended left me the map to the 
Lost Dutchman Mine,” he had 
said, waving his glass. “To the 
Spanish Treasure.” 

When Mr. White, puzzed, asked 
what he meant, Don had said, “It’s 
easy. You just walk around the 
horses.” Now what, just exactly, 
had Don meant by that? 

“I must have been drunk, Wal- 
ter.” 

“Oh, yes, you were drunk, all 
right. But in vino veritas . Now 
I’ve been thinking it out very care- 
fully, Don. It seems to me that 
‘the old desert rat’ you spoke of 
must have been that fellow Elwell, 
who slipped on the ice two winters 
ago. The one you got to the hospi- 
tal and visited regularly till he died. 
Am I right, Don? Am I?” 

r^ON nodded miserably. “Damn 
liquor,” he added. 

“Now we’re making progress,” 
said Walt. “Okay. Now about this 
map to the mine. I know he left 
you that damn notebook. I know 
that. But I looked it over very 
carefully and it was just a lot of 
figures scribbled — equations, or 
what ever th’ hell you call ’em. But 
it had something else in it, didn’t 
it? Something you took out. We’ll 
get to just what by and by. So — 



88 



GALAXY 



and it was right after that that you 
started going on these vacations of 
yours. Made me curious. Those 
funny clothes you wore.” 

Stiff and tight, Don sat in the 
bright, neat kitchen and watched 
the waters rise. There was nothing 
for him here and now, except for 
Mary and the children, and his love 
for them had been no more selfish 
than theirs for him. He had been 
glad when Walt first appeared, 
happy when they married, unhappy 
when Walt’s real nature appeared, 
very pleased when the chance oc- 
curred to offer “a position” to his 
brother-in-law. The misgivings felt 
when a few people actually offered 
to buy the shapeless wooden things 
he had created almost aimlessly 
(he knowing that he was not a 
sculptor but a craftsman) vanished 
when he saw it was the perfect set- 
up for keeping Mary and the kids 
supported. 

Of course, after a while Don had 
been able to arrange the majority 
of the “sales.” The waste of time 
involved in hacking out the wooden 
horrors which “private collectors” 
bought was deplorable. The whole 
system was dreadfully clumsy, but 
its sole purpose — to create a world 
in which Walter would be satisfied 
and Mary happy — was being ful- 
filled, at any rate. 

Or had been. 

What would happen now, with 
Walter on the verge of finding out 
everything? 

TAKE WOODEN INDIANS 



“And Syracuse — what a cotton- 
pickin’ alibi! I figured you had a 
woman hid away for sure, wasting 
your time when you should have 
been working, so — well, I wanted 
to find out who she was, where she 
lived. That’s why I always went 
through your pockets when you 
came back from these ‘vacations’—” 
“Walter, you didn’t!” 

B ut of course he knew damned 
well that Walter did. Had 
known for some time that Walter 
was doing it. Had acted accord- 
ingly. Instead of hiding the evi- 
dence, he had deliberately planted 
it, and in such a way that it 
couldn’t possibly fail to add up to 
exactly one conclusion. 

“What a lot of junk!” Walter 
jeered. “Like somebody swept the 
floor of an antique shop and 
dumped it all in your pocket. Tick- 
et stubs with funny old printing, 
clippings from newspapers of years 
back — and all like that. However 
— ” he jabbed a thick, triumphant 
finger at Don— “money is money, 
no matter how old it is. Right? 
Damned right! Old dollar bills, old 
gold pieces. Time after time. You 
weren’t very cautious, old buddy. 
So now— just what is this ‘Spanish 
Treasure’ that you’ve been tap- 
ping? Let’s have the details, son, 
or else I’ll be mighty unhappy. And 
when I’m unhappy, Mary is, too. .” 
That was very true, Don had 
realized for some time now. And if 

89 



Mary couldn’t protect herself, how 
could the youngsters escape? 

“I’m tired of scraping along on 
ten per cent, you see, Don. I got 
that great old American ambition; 
I want to be in business for myself. 
And you are going to provide the 
capital. So — again, and for the last 
time — let’s have the details.” 

Was this the time to tell him? 
And, hard upon the thought, the 
answer came: Yes, the time was 
now, time to tell the truth. At once 
his heart felt light, joyous; the 
heavy weight (long so terribly, 
constantly familiar) was removed 
from him. 

“Mr. Elwell — the old gentleman 
who slipped on the ice; you were 
right about that, Walter—” Walter’s 
face slipped into its familiar, smug 
smile. “Mr. Elwell was a math 
teacher at the high school down the 
block. Imagine it — a genius like 
him, pounding algebra into the 
heads of sullen children! But he 
didn’t let it get him down, because 
that was just his living. What he 
mainly lived for were his space- 
time theorems. ‘Elwell’s Equa- 
tions,’ we called them—” 

Walter snorted. “Don’t tell me 
the old gimp was a time traveler 
and left you his time machine?” 

“It wasn’t a machine. It was only 
a— well, I guess it was a sort of map, 
after all. He tried to explain his 
theories to me, but I just couldn’t 
understand them. It was kind of 
like chess problems — I never could 



understand them, either. So when 
we arranged that I was going to 
visit 1880, he wrote it all down for 
me. It’s like a pattern. You go back 
and forth and up and down and 
after a while—” 

“After a while you’re in 1880?” 

“That’s right.” 

Walter’s face had settled in odd 
lines. “I thought you were going to 
try not telling me what I’d figured 
out for myself,” he said in the cut- 
ting exaggeration of his normally 
exaggerated Southern drawl. This 
was the first time he had used it on 
Don, though Don had heard it used 
often enough on Mary and the kids. 
“The map, and all those clues you 
were stupid enough to leave in your 
pockets, and the stupidest of all- 
carving your own squiggle signa- 
ture into all those dozens of old 
wooden Indians. Think I can’t 
add?” 

“But that was Canal Street, 1880, 
and this is now,” said Don in a 
carefully dismal-sounding voice. “I 
thought it was safe.” 

Walter looked at him. Walter — 
who had never earned an ethical 
dollar in his life, and had scarcely 
bothered to make a pretense of 
supporting his wife since Don’s 
work had started to sell — asked, 
“All right, why 1880 — and why 
wooden Indians?” 

T^ON explained to him how he 
felt at ease there, how the air 
was fresher, the food tastier, how 



90 



GALAXY 



the Russians were a menace only 
to other Russians, how — and the 
sachems! What real, sincere pleas- 
ure and pride he got out of carving 
them. 

They were used! Not like the 
silly modern stuff he . turned out 
now, stuff whose value rested only 
on the fact that self-seekers like 
Edgar Feld were able to con crit- 
ics and public into believing it was 
valuable. 

Walt scarcely heard him. “But 
how much money can you make 
carving wooden Indians?” 

“Not very much in modern 
terms. But you see, Walt — I in- 
vest.” 

And that was the bait in the trap 
he’d set and Walt rose to it and 
struck. “The market! Damn it to 
hell, of course!” The prospect of 
the (for once in his whole shoddy 
career) Absolutely Sure Thing, 
the Plunge which was certain to 
be a Killing, of moving where he 
could know without doubt what 
the next move would be, almost 
deprived Walter of breath. 

“A tycoon,” he gasped. “You 
could have been a tycoon and all 
you could think of was—” 

Don said that he didn’t want to 
be a tycoon. He just wanted to 
carve wooden— 

“Why, I could make us better 
than tycoons! Kings! Emperors! 
One airplane—” He subsided after 
Don convinced him that Elwell’s 
Equation could transport only the 

TAKE WOODEN INDIANS 



individual and what he had on or 
was carrying. “Lugers,” he mut- 
tered. “Tommy-guns. If I’m a mil- 
lionaire, I’ll need bodyguards. 
Gould, Fisk, Morgan — they better 
watch out, that’s all.” 

He slowly refocused on Don. 
“And I’ll carry the map,” he said. 

TTE held out his hand. Slowly, as 
if with infinite misgivings, 
Don handed over to him the paper 
with Elwell’s 1880 Equation. 

Walter looked at it, lips moving, 
brows twisting, and Don recalled 
his own mystification when the old 
man had showed it to him. 

“. where X is one pace and Y is 
five-sixth of the hypotenuse of a 
right-angled triangle of which both 
arms are x in length . .” 

“Well,” said Walter, “now let’s 
get down to business.” He rose, 
went off toward the living room, 
returned in a minute. Following 
him was a man with the tense, set 
face of a fanatic. He looked at Don 
with burning eyes. 

“Anders!” cried Don. 

“Where is the Equation?” An- 
ders demanded. 

“Oh, I got that,” Walter said. 
He took it out, showed a glimpse, 
thrust it in his pocket. He stepped 
back, put a chair between him and 
the WIS man. 

“Not so fast,” he said. “I got it 
and I’m keeping it. At least for now. 
So let’s talk business. Where’s the 
cash?”

A S Anders, breathing heavily, 
brought out the roll of bills, 
“Oh, Walter, what have you done?” 
Don moaned. “Don’t throw me in 
the bramble-bush. Brer Wolf!” 
“Here is the first part of it,” said 
Anders, ignoring his former WIS 
associate. “For this you agree to 
return to Canal Street, 1880, and 
destroy — by whatever means are 
available — the infamous firm of 
Demuth’s. In the unlikely case of 
their continuing in the business af- 
ter the destruction—” 

“They won’t. Best goon job 
money can buy; leave it to me.” 
Anders hesitated. 

Walter promptly said, “No, you 
can’t come along. Don’t ask again. 
Just him and me. I’ll need him for 
bird-dogging. I’ll get in touch when 
we come back. As agreed, I bring 
back copies of the New York pa- 
pers showing that Demuth’s was 
blown up or burned down. On your 
way.” 

With one single hate-filled 
glance, not unmixed with triumph, 
at Don, Anders withdrew. The door 
closed. Walter laughed. 

“You aren’t—” Don began. 

“Not a chance. Think I’m crazy? 
Let him and his crackpot buddies 
whistle for their money. No doubt 
you are wondering how I put two 
and two in a vertical column and 
added, hey, Donny boy? Well, once 
I figured out that the ‘Prospector’ 
was Elwell, and saw the WIS mem- 
bership card in your pocket, I re-

membered that he and you used to 
go to those WIS meetings together, 
and I got in touch with them. They 
practically told me the whole story, 
but I wanted confirmation from 
you. All right, on your feet. We’ve 
got a pea patch to tear up.” 

While Walt was shaving, Don 
and Mary had a few minutes to- 
gether. 

“Why don’t you just go, Don?” 
she begged. “I mean for good — 
away where he can’t find you — and 
stay there. Never mind about me 
or the children. We’ll make out.” 
“But wouldn’t he take it out on 
you and them?” 

“I said don’t worry about us and 
I mean it. He’s not all bad, you 
know. Oh, he might be, for a while, 
but that’s just because he never 
really adjusted to living up North. 
Maybe if we went back to his home 
town— he always talks about it— I 
mean he’d be different there—” 

He listened unhappily to her 
losing her way between wanting 
him out of her misery and hoping 
that the unchangeable might 
change. 

“Mary,” he broke in, “you don’t 
have to worry any mo^e. I’m taking 
Walt along and setting him up — 
really setting him up. And listen—” 
he wrote a name and address on 
the back of her shopping list— “go 
see this man. I’ve been investing 
money with his firm and there’s 
plenty to take care of you and the 
kids — even if things go wrong with 



Walt and me. This man will han- 
dle all your expenses.” 

She nodded, not speaking. They 
smiled, squeezed hands. There was 
no need for embrace or kiss-the- 
children. 

Whistling “Dixie,” Walter re- 
turned. “Let’s go,” he said. 

“Good-by, Don,” said Mary. 

“Good-by, Mary,” said Don. 

HAT afternoon, Don Benedict 
and Walter Swift, after visits to 
a theatrical costumer and a numis- 
matist, entered the Canal Street 
subway station. Those who have 
had commerce with that crossroads 
of lower Manhattan know how 
vast, how labyrinthine, it is. Only 
a few glances, less than idly curious, 
were given them as they paced 
through the late Mr. Elwell’s math- 
ematical map. No one was pres- 
ent when they passed beneath a 
red-lettered sign reading “Canar- 
sie Line” and vanished away. 

As soon as he felt the flagstones 
beneath his feet, Walter whirled 
around and looked back. Instead 
of the white-tiled corridor, he saw 
a wet stone wall. For a moment, he 
swore feebly. Then he laughed. 

“A pocketful of long green and 
another of gold eagles!” he ex- 
claimed. “What shall we try for 
first? Erie or New York Central 
Common? No — first I want to see 
this place where you work. Oh, yes, 
I do. Obstinacy will get you no- 
where. Lead on.”

Wishing eventually to introduce 
Walt into Hennaberry’s, Don had 
first taken him out to Canal Street. 
Leopold Schwager’s second-hand 
establishment was opposite, the 
sidewalk lined with superannuated 
sachems. Other establishments of 
the show-figure trade were within 
stonethrow, their signs, flags and 
figures making a brave display. 
Horsecars, cabs, drays, private car- 
riages went clattering by. 

Walter watched the passing 
scene with relish, leering at the 
women in what he evidently 
thought was the best 1880 mash- 
er’s manner. Then he wrinkled his 
nose. 

“Damn it all,” he said, “I hadn’t 
realized that the Hayes Admini- 
stration smelled so powerfully of 
the horse. But I suppose you like 
it?. Yes,” he sneered, “you would. 
Well, enjoy it while you can. As 
soon as I manage to dig up some 
old plans, I propose to patent the 
internal combustion engine.” 

Don felt his skin go cold. 

“John D. Rockefeller ought to 
be very, ver-ry interested,” Walt 
said exultantly. “Why, five years 
from now, you won’t know it’s the 
same street . Whafre you point- 
ing at?” 

Don gestured to a scout-figure 
in full plumage outside a store 
whose awning was painted with 
the words, “August Schwartz Se- 
gar Mfger Also Snuff, Plug, Cut 
Plug and Twist.” 

TAKE WOODEN INDIANS 



“One of mine,” he said, pride 
mixed with growing resolve. 

Walter grunted. “You won’t have 
any time for that sort of thing any 
more; I’ll need you myself. Be- 
sides — yes, why not? Introduce 
cigarette machinery. Start a great 
big advertising campaign, put a 
weed in the mouth of every Ameri- 
can over the age of sixteen.” 

A DRUNKEN sailor lurched 
down the street singing “Sweet 
Ida Jane from Portland, Maine.” 
Automatically, Don stepped aside 
to let him pass. 

“But if you do that,” he said, no 
longer doubting that Walter would 
if he could, “then there won’t be 
any more — nobody will need — I 
mean my work—” 

Walter said irritably, “I told you, 
you won’t have the time to be pid- 
dling around with a mallet and 
chisel. And now let’s see your 
wooden-Injun mine.” 

Acting as if he felt that nothing 
mattered any more, Don turned 
and led the way toward the brick 
building where C. E. Hennaberry, 
Show Figures And Emblematic 
Signs, did business. Ben the boy 
paused in his never-ending work 
of dusting the stock models to give 
a word and a wave in greeting. He 
stared at Walt. 

In the back was the office, old 
Van Wart the clerk-cashier and old 
Considine the clerk-bookkeeper, on 
their high stools, bending over their 

95 



books as usual. On the wall was a 
dirty photograph in a black-draped 
frame, with the legend “Hon. Wm. 
Marcy Tweed, Grand Sachem of 
the Columbian Order of St. Tam- 
many” and underneath the portrait 
was the Major himself. 

“So this is the place!” Walter 
declared, exaggerated Southern ac- 
cent rolling richly. Major Henna- 
berry’s friend. Col. Cox, sitting on 
the edge of the desk cutting himself 
a slice of twist, jumped as if stung 
by a minie-ball. His rather greasy 
sealskin cap slid over one eye. 

“Get all kinds of people in here, 
don’t you, Cephas?” he growled. 
“All’s I got to say is: I was at 
Fredericksburg, I was at Shilo, and 
all’s I got to say is: the only good 
Rebel is a dead Rebel!” 

The Major, as Don well knew, 
hated Rebels himself, with a fer- 
vor possible only to a Tammany 
Democrat whose profitable specu- 
lations in cotton futures had been 
interrupted for four long, lean 
years. Don also knew that the Ma- 
jor had a short way of dealing with 
partisans of the Lost Cause, or with 
anyone else who had cost or threat- 
ened to cost him money — if he 
could just be brought to the point. 

The Major looked up now, his 
eye lighting coldly on Walter, who 
gazed around the not overly clean 
room with a curious stare. “Yes, 
sir, might I serve you, sir? Nice 
fly-figure, maybe? Can supply you 
with a Highlander holding simu- 



lated snuff-mill at a tear-down 
price; no extra charge for tam-o- 
shanter. Oh, Dusty. Glad to see 
you—” 

“Dusty” mumbled an introduc- 
tion. How quickly things had 
changed— though not in any way 
for the better — and how paradox- 
ically: because he had refused the 
WIS demand to change the past 
by violence so that modernism 
would be held off indefinitely, he 
was now condemned to see modern- 
ism arrive almost at once. Unless, 
of course . 

?f|jROTHER-IN-LAW, eh?” 
said Major Hennaberry, be- 
ginning to wheeze. “Dusty’s done 
some speaking about you. Mmph.” 
He turned abruptly to Don/Dusty. 
“What’s all this, my boy, that 
Charley Voles was telling me — 
Demuth’s coming up with some 
devilish scheme to introduce cast- 
iron show figures?” Dusty started, 
a movement noted by the keen 
though bloodshot eyes of his some- 
time employer. “Then it is true? 
Terrible' thing, unconscionable. 
Gave me the liver complaint afresh, 
directly I heard of it. Been on medi- 
cated wine ever since.” 

Walt turned angrily on his 
brother-in-law. “Who told you to 
open your damn cotton-pickin’ 
mouth?” 

The Major’s purplish lips parted, 
moved in something doubtless in- 
tended for a smile.

GALAXY 



“Now, gents,” he said, “let’s not 
quarrel. What must be must be, 
eh?” 

“Now you’re talking,” said Walt, 
and evidently not realizing that he 
and Hennaberry had quite separate 
things in mind, he added: “Things 
will be different, but you’ll get used 
to them.” 

Watching the Major start to 
wheeze in an unreasoning attack of 
rage. Dusty knew catal 5 dic action 
was needed. “How about a drink. 
Major?” he suggested. “A Rat 
Nolan special?” 

Unpurpling quickly, now merely 
nodding and hissing, the Major 
called for Ben. He took a coin out 
of his change purse and said: “Run 
over to Cooney’s barrelhouse and 
bring back some glasses and a 
pitcher of rum cocktail. And ask 
Cooney does he know where Nolan 
is. I got some business with him.” 

The boy left on the lope, and 
there was a short, tight silence. 
Then Col. Cox spoke, an anticipa- 
tory trickle already turning the cor- 
ners of his mouth a wet brown. “I 
was at Island Number Ten, and I 
was at Kenisaw Moimtain, and 
what I say is: the only good Rebel 
is a dead Rebel.” 

Walt grinned and said nothing 
until Ben came back with the 
drinks. 

“Well, Scotch on the rocks it 
isn’t,” he said then, taking a brief 
sip, “but it’s not bad.” 

He gave a brief indifferent glance 

TAKE WOODEN INDIANS 



at the shifty little man with Burn- 
side whiskers who had come back 
with Ben, carrying the glasses. 

“To science and invention!” cried 
Walt. “To progress!” He drained 
half his glass. His face turned green, 
then white. He started to slide side- 
wise and was caught by the little 
man in Burnsides. 

“Easy does it, cully,” said Mr. 
Rat Nolan, for it was he. “Dear, 
dear! I hope it’s not a touch of this 
cholera morbus what’s been so pre- 
valent. Expect we’d better get him 
to a doctor, don’t you, gents?” 

Major Hennaberry said that 
there was not a doubt about it. He 
walked painfully over to the ele- 
vator shaft, whistled shrilly. “Char- 
ley?” he called. “Larry? Oscar? 
Otto? Hennery? Get down here 
directly!” 

Dusty emerged from his surprise 
at how neatly it had happened. He 
reached into Walter’s coat pocket 
and took out the paper with Elwell’s 
Equation on it. Now he was safe, 
and so was Canal Street, 1880. 
As for what would happen when 
Walter recovered from his strange 
attack — well, they would see. 

^^HE staff came out of the ele- 
vator cage with interest written 
large and plain upon their faces. 
Ben had evidently found time from 
his errand to drop a few words. 
Major Hennaberry gestured to- 
ward Walter, reclining, gray-faced, 
against the solicitous Mr. Rat 

97 



Nolan, who held him in a firm grip. 

“Gent is took bad,” the Major 
explained. “Couple of you go out 
and see if you can find a cab — 
Snow Ferguson or Blinky Poole or 
one of those shunsoaps — and tell 
them to drive up by the alley. No 
sense in lugging this poor gent out 
the front.” 

Franz, Larry and Charley 
nodded and went out 

Otto stared. “No more vooden 
Indians, if he gets his vay,” he said 
dismally at last “Ho, Chesus,” he 
moaned. 

Dusty began, “Major, this is all 
so — ” 

“Now don’t be woritting about 
your brother-in-law,” said Rat 
Nolan soothingly. “For Dr. Coyle is 
a sovereign hand at curing what ails 
all pasty-faced, consumptive types 
like this one.” 

Dusty said that he was sure of 
it. “Where is Dr. Coyle’s office 
these days?” he asked. 

Mr. Rat Nolan coughed lightly, 
gazed at a cobweb in a corner of 
the ceiling. “The southwest passage 
to Amoy by way of the Straights is 
what the Doc is recommending for 
his patients — and he insists on ac- 
companying them to see they fol- 
lows doctor’s orders, such being the 
degree of his merciful and tender- 
loving care . .” 

Dusty nodded approvingly. 

“Ah, he’s a rare one,” said R. 
Nolan with enthusiasm, “is Bully 
Coyle, master of the Beriah Jaspers 



of the Black Star Line! A rare one 
and a rum one, and the Shanghai- 
ing would be a half-dead trade 
without ’m, for it does use up men. 
And they leave on the morning 
tide.” 

^ I ' HERE was a noise of clomp- 
clomp and metal harness-pieces 
jingled in the alley. Charley, Larry 
and Hennery came in, followed by 
a furtive-looking cabman with a 
great red hooked nose — Snow 
Ferguson, presumably, or Blinky 
Poole, or one of those shimsoaps. 

“Ah, commerce, commerce,” Rat 
Nolan sighed. “It waits upon no 
man’s pleasure.” He went through 
unconscious Walter’s pockets with 
dispatch and divided the money 
into equal piles. From his own, he 
took a half-eagle which had been 
slightly scalloped and handed it to 
Dusty. “Share and share alike, 
and here’s the regular fee. That’s 
the spirit what made America great. 
Leave all them foreign monarchs 
beware . Give us a lift with the 
gent here, cullies . .” 

Charley took the head, Hennery 
and Otto the arms, while Larry and 
Ben held the feet. Holding the door 
open, the cabman observed, “Dam- 
fino-looking shoes this coffee-cool- 
er’s got on.” 

“Them’s mine,” said Rat Nolan 
instantly. “He’ll climb the rigging 
better without ’em. Mind the door, 
cullies — don’t damage the mer- 
chandise!”

"TkOWN the dim aisles the pro- 
cession went, past the fly- 
figures, scout-figures, rosebuds, 
pompeys, Highlandmen, and Turks. 
The gas-jets flared, the shadows 
danced, the sachems scowled. 

“If he comes to and shows fight,” 
Major Hennaberry called, “give 
him a tap with the mallet, one of 
you!” He turned to Dusty, put a 
hand on his shoulder. “While I rea- 
lize, my boy, that no man can be 
called to account for the actions of 
his brother-in-law in this Great Re- 
public of ours, still I expect this will 
prove a lesson to you. From your 
silence, I perceive that you agree. 
Your sister now — hate to see a 
lady’s tears — ” 

Dusty took a deep breath. The 
air smelled deliciously of fresh 
wood and paint. “She’ll adjust,” he 
said. Mary would be quite well off 
with the money from his invest- 
ments. So there was no need, none 
at all, for his return. And if the WIS 
tried to follow him, to make more 
trouble, why— there was always Rat 
Nolan. 

“Major Hennaberry, sir,” he 
said vigorously, “we’ll beat De- 
muth’s yet. You remember what 
you said when the catalog came 
out, about the power of advertis- 
ing? We’ll run their metal monsters 
into the ground and put a wooden 
fly-figure on every street block in 
America!” 

And they did.

BY WILLY LEY 



ANY QUESTIONS? 

E lsewhere in this issue, 

the editor reports on the poll 
of reader’s opinions as to how 
they want the big new Galaxy to 
look. At the moment of writing my 
own piece, I only know what has 
been passed on to me by way of an 
inter-office memo, which states that 
two main points were made by the 
readers with regard to this column. 
One is that the readers want “more 
speculation.” The other is that they 
want the “Any Questions?” section 
restored. 



100 



GALAXY 



As regards the first point, I 
thought of a story I once read or 
heard: namely, that a genuinely 
wise man (in France, I believe) ad- 
vised the professional wise men 
who deal with horoscopes and re- 
lated devices to put all their proph- 
ecies so far into the future that the 
customer cannot possibly live long 
enough to check on whether they 
will come true. 

The reason I remember this 
story in connection with the request 
for “more speculation” is Galaxy’s 
new schedule on the one hand and 
the NASA’s (these letters stand for 
National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration), promised sched- 
ule of one artificial satellite per 
month. And there are, in addition. 
Army and Air Force programs 
which are more closely tied to mili- 
tary needs, but which can and will 
result in things going into orbits: 
around the Earth, around the Moon 
and around the Sun. And the Rus- 
sian Academy of Science must have 
a program, too. 

TN the past, I have occasionally 
risked predicting an event in 
the space and satellite field. This 
is a risk I can no longer take, for 
space programs nowadays move so 
fast that even daily newspapers 
have trouble keeping up with them. 
Speculation, therefore, can be ap- 
plied only to fields where an in- 
formed guess isn’t likely to be 
proved or disproved before it even 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



appears in print. In other fields, 
though, the wish for speculation 
will be treated as an order. 

As for the request for the return 
of the “Any Questions?” section, I 
am able to oblige — glad to, in fact. 
That section quietly disappeared 
only for the reason that the readers 
did not feed it properly. I’m not 
saying that I did not get a fair num- 
ber of questions every month. But 
most of them were so narrow in in- 
terest that I felt that they did not 
have enough appeal for most read- 
ers. Sometimes I got a question, or 
several, with stamped return en- 
velope enclosed and the request: 
please reply at once; I can’t wait for 
publication. On the assumption that 
these letters came from people who 
had exams coming up or were eager 
to collect a bet, I complied when 
I could. 

But while I am still short of writ- 
ten questions, I am abundantly sup- 
plied with oral ones. I spent most 
of the fall and winter traveling 
through the United States for the 
purpose of filling lecture engage- 
ments. After every lecture there is 
an official question-and-answer 
period, but I do not refer to these 
sessions which are part of the pro- 
gram. By now I know which ques- 
tions are going to be asked. 

Just to see whether I myself 
caused such a predictable set of 
questions in some manner peculiar 
only to me, I spent one evening at- 
tending a lecture by Dr. Wernher 

101 



von Braun to find out what the au- 
dience might throw at him. If I had 
had a list of the questions asked of 
me two days earlier in Detroit, and 
had made another list of the ques- 
tions asked of Wernher von Braun 
that night, they would have shown 
an overlap of better than eighty per 
cent. 

The questions I have in mind for 
this column are the ones which 
came up after the official question- 
and-answer periods. Somebody 
(and he or she was usually a sci- 
ence fiction reader) would come 
up with something that could not 
be answered immediately. Some- 
times the arithmetic involved was 
such that it could not be done with- 
out pencil and paper (especially 
not after nearly two hours of pub- 
lic speaking and while being driven 
to the airport). Sometimes I did 
not know the answer, but merely 
knew where it can be looked up. 

I can’t credit any names. After 
many weeks of traveling and speak- 
ing, I simply do not remember 
them. But each one of the questions 
in the following actually was asked. 

THE SPACESHIP WITH 
STEADY ACCELERATION 

I ^ HE spaceship with the steady 
acceleration came up three 
times: once from a newspaperman 
at Cape Canaveral, once from a 
teacher (female) in Fayetteville, 
N. C., and once from an airplane 



pilot in Lubbock, Texas. In all 
three cases, the figures were the 
same too : namely, the obvious one 
of a steady acceleration of one “g.” 
If we could build a ship which 
would travel with one “g” of steady 
acceleration, the people inside 
would feel as if they were on the 
ground. But how fast would they 
be going how soon? 

There is a complication here. If 
such a ship took off from the 
ground, the people inside would 
naturally feel an acceleration of 
two “g,” one “g” being due to the 
acceleration of the ship and the 
other due to the gravitational ac- 
celeration caused by the gravita- 
tional field of the Earth. So we 
agreed that we would first let the 
ship climb very gently to a dis- 
tance of 200,000 miles, where the 
Earth’s gravitational field is still 
present, of course, but can be called 
negligible. 

From that point on, we decided 
to travel at one “g” acceleration for 
precisely one day, or 24 hours, or 
86,400 seconds. Now the velocity 
at the end of the day would be 
V = at. The value for “t” is 86,400; 
the value of the acceleration, ex- 
pressed in meters per second, is 
9.81. Now you just multiply, get- 
ting 847,584 meters per second as 
your final velocity at the end of that 
day. This is the equivalent of 
526.66 miles per second. Pretty 
fast, but how far did they get? 

The formula for the distance “s” 



102 



GALAXY 



traveled is s = t^a/2; you square 
the time and multiply it by half of 
the acceleration used. The result is 
36,558,800 kilometers or 22.7 mil- 
lion miles. This would be halfway 
to the orbit of Mars. Such a ship 
could effect a landing on Mars 
about two days after takeoff — if it 
could be built and if enough energy 
were somehow available. 

I feel rather sure that I won’t live 
to see such a ship, but even under 
such steady acceleration, it would 
take some time until the speed of 
light was approached. Which re- 
mark inevitably produces the ques- 
tion of whether the speed of light 
can be passed or not. 

When that question comes up 
now, I always repeat the answer I 
gave to my elder daughter when she 
asked this at the breakfast table 
half a year ago. She was then, which 
is of some importance to the story, 
only a few weeks older than 14 
years. After she asked that ques- 
tion, I looked at her seriously and 
said: “Sandra, this is for your son 
to worry about, not us.” 

DR. EINSTEIN AND THE 
SPEED OF LIGHT 

i^NE frequent oral question, 
which also came in by mail 
several times, is what Dr. Einstein, 
if he were still alive, would say to 
the following problem. A spaceship. 
Dr. Einstein maintained, coud not 
reach the speed of light. But he 



probably would have admitted that 
a spaceship might move with 60 
per cent of the speed of light. Now 
if two ships each move with 60 per 
cent of the speed of light, but move 
away from each other, they would 
move with more than the speed 
of light relative to each other, 
wouldn’t they? 

Or in another version: let’s say, 
a spaceship moves at half the speed 
of light. Then its captain switches 
on the ship’s nose searchlight, 
which shines forward. Since the 
light from the searchlight moves 
with the speed of light, but the ship 
carrying it already moves with half 
the speed of light, what would Dr. 
Einstein say? 

My offhand guess is that he 
would groan. 

But I can tell how he explained 
such things to his students. Let us 
first assume a tank moving forward 
at a fair clip on a road. We’ll call 
its speed V. Now the tank man fires 
his gun forward without stopping. 
The velocity of the shell relative 
to the tank shall be called “v.” The 
velocity of the shell relative to the 
road is then obviously V + v. 

This simple formula is the one 
everybody uses and Dr. Einstein 
would have admitted that it works 
for practical purposes. But he 
would have insisted that V v is 
a simplified formula. The correct 
or complete formula for the speed 
of the shell relative to the ground 
would be: 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



103 



V + V 



vx V 



namely, tank speed plus shell veloc- 
ity divided by “1” plus the product 
of these two velocities divided by 
the square of the speed of light. 
Now if V and v are tiny when com- 
pared to the speed of light (which 
they normally are), the formula ac- 
quires the shape of : 

V + v 

which is the same as V v. 

Now let us try this for the space- 
ship and the searchlight beam, but 
to make it easier, we’ll assume that 
the spaceship is traveling with the 
speed of light itself. We’ll call the 
ship’s velocity V and that of the 
searchlight beam c (since it is light 
traveling). Then the formula looks 
like this: 

V-fc 



which can be written more simply 
as: 

V-l-c 
1-f V/c 

or still simpler: 

c(V + c) 

(c + V) 

but this is just a complicated man- 
ner of just writing “c.” _ 



You always end up with the 
speed of light, never more. 

Yes, it contradicts “common 
sense,” but that is how Einstein’s 
formula reads. What the next gen- 
eration or the one after that will do 
with this formula is something I 
can’t even remotely guess at. 

THE FIRST RUSSIAN 
RESEARCH ROCKETS 

T ET us return to the ground now 
for a short while and deal with 
people who were always thought to 
be more groundbound than any- 
body else on this planet — the Rus- 
sians. 

Usually, when I have a public 
lecture, I tell the story of how Kon- 
stantin Eduardovitch Ziolkovsky 
wrote the first scientific treatise on 
rocketry in 1898 and submitted it 
to the editor of the monthly popu- 
lar scientific journal Na-ootchnoye 
Obozrayniye (“Science Survey”), 
who required five years to make up 
his mind to publish it, so that it was 
printed in 1903. 1 use this story in 
my lecture to indicate the date of 
Ziolkovsky’s birthday. 

According to the (old style) 
Julian calendar in use in Russia 
when Ziolkovsky was born, his 
birthday was the 5 th of September, 
1857. But after the Russian revo- 
lution, the Soviets adopted the 
Gregorian calendar and now refer 
to events before the revolution with 
the dates they would have had if 



104 



GALAXY 



the Gregorian calendar had been in 
use then. 

This re-dates Ziolkovsky’s birth- 
day as the 17th of September, 
1857, which is the date that was 
actually at the head of any daily 
newspaper on that day across the 
border in Germany or in nearby 
Sweden. The reason for making 
this point is, of course, that Ziol- 
kovsky’s hundredth birthday, Sep- 
tember 17, 1957, was the intended 
date for the shooting of Sputnik I. 

After the lecture, there is always 
at least one person who wants to 
know how we know that Ziolkov- 
sky actually wrote such a treatise. 
The answer to that is simple : I own 
a copy of it; Ziolkovsky mailed it 
to me in 1931. But, somebody else 
will ask then, did that man make 
experiments? No, he didn’t. Aha, 
still another person will chortle, 
they did not experiment until they 
captured all those Germans! 

Well, it so happens that the first 
Russian to experiment with liquid- 
fuel rockets had a German name. 
But in spite of that name, he was 
a Russian; moreover, he began ex- 
perimenting in 1933. His name was 
Friedrich Arturovitch Zander and 
he published a book on rocket 
theory and on ideas about experi- 
ments in 1932. (I have a copy of 
that book, too.) Zander’s first 
rocket motor to work (some earlier 
models may easily have blown up) 
produced a thrust of 110 pounds. 
In his book. Zander proposed a 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



small airplane as test vehicle for 
his rocket motors. I don’t know 
whether he actually did this. Nor 
do I know his whereabouts now or 
even whether he is still alive. 

The first Russian research rocket 
we know of was built in 1935 by 
M. K. Tikhonravov (now often 
mentioned in connection with Rus- 
sian artificial satellites) with a 
motor by L. S. Dushkin. Burning 
kerosene with nitric acid (a fuel 
combination still used in Russian 
research rockets), this rocket rose 
to a height of about six miles. The 
last Russian experiment before the 
Second World War was just what 
Zander had had in mind: a glider 
with a rocket motor. This rocket 
motor was Dushkin’s, too. 

THE BEST SIZE FOR AN 
ARTIFICIAL SATELLITE 

S PEAKING of Russians, we 
have to talk about their satel- 
lites. Pravda, every once in a while, 
ran a tabulation of satellite weights 
and orbits, stressing the fact that 
the biggest of the Russian satellites 
weighs IVa tons while ours carried 
an instrument load of not quite 20 
pounds. 

This discrepancy was, of course, 
one of the recurrent questions and 
I won’t go into this at this point. 
But one young man in Orlando, 
Florida, who identified himself as 
a science fiction and especially a 
Galaxy reader, added a new twist. 

105 



He asked me whether there was an 
“optimum size” for an artificial 
satellite. Maybe, he added, ours are 
too small, but isn’t it possible that 
the Russian satellites are too big? 

There was not enough time to go 
into this problem and I did promise 
to tell him in print, which I am now 
doing. 

The problem began with think- 
ing about the weight (and inciden- 
tally size) an artificial satellite 
would have to have. This was not 
too simple, as I can testify, because 
I ran into this problem once. Dur- 
ing the winter of 1946-47, I began 
to wonder what would have to be 
added to the only then existing 
rocket, the V-2, to launch a satel- 
lite with it. This, in turn, brought 
up the question whether current 
rocket fuels were powerful enough 
for satellite launching. This led to 
the question of how much payload 
these fuels would have to carry 
into an orbit. 

I hopefully acquired a number of 
catalogues of instrument-making 
companies and began to go through 
them. Well, everything was care- 
fully stated, physical principles, 
performance, adjustment range, 
often even the size. Did anybody 
mention the weight? Usually not! 
The reason was that these instru- 
ments were meant to be used in 
laboratories. Maybe on shipboard. 
The designers had taken into con- 
sideration that they might be carted 
around in automobiles and had pro- 



vided carrying cases and often 
pointed out that the construction 
was “rugged, for student use.” 

I finally gave up, assumed that 
the satellite would have to weigh 
200 pounds, and went ahead with 
my attempt to find out whether a 
three-stage rocket for known fuels 
with satellite capability (as they 
now say) was possible at all. It 
was. 

Some six years later. Dr. S. Fred 
Singer published the first detailed 
design of an artificial satellite, with- 
out paying attention to what rocket 
would carry it. The design was 
MOUSE, Minimum Orbital Un- 
manned Satellite of Earth. Note 
that the first letter stands for Mini- 
mum and Dr. Singer said that it 
would weigh about 100 pounds. 
This was in 1953. 

Two years or so later, when Van- 
guard was discussed, the instru- 
ment men first talked about a 30- 
inch sphere weighing 40 pounds, 
which they then reduced to a 20- 
inch sphere weighing 22 pounds. 
Some, but not all, of this steady 
scaling down reflected the progress 
of the instrument makers who, 
once the challenge existed, were 
quite successful in making things 
lighter and smaller. 

T OOKING at reality — that is, 
the satellites which are in orbit 
or which have been in orbit — it 
must be kept in mind that only one 
of them was put there by a rocket 



106 



GALAXY 



designed for satellite launching. 
This is the little 3^^ pound Van- 
guard test satellite. All the others 
were put into orbit by rockets in 
operational use that were adapted 
for the purpose. 

The fact that they were in oper- 
ational use makes their perform- 
ance more reliable. But the satel- 
lite weight then has to be what 
these rockets which happen to be 
available can put into orbit. 

The Jupiter-C rocket could man- 
age up to 38 pounds, of which 12 
pounds are the empty casing of the 
top stage. The Jupiter-C could not 
carry a higher weight into orbit. On 
the other hand, the big Russian mis- 
siles also had to carry the weights 
they did carry. If they had carried 
less, the payload would have been 
shot into space, but it would not 
have gone into orbit around the 
Earth. 

So much for the story of the 
problem and for the existing facts. 
Now back to the question of 
whether there is an optimal weight. 

It is easy to show that a satel- 
lite could be too small. The Van- 
guard test satellite would be fairly 
useless if the silicon solar batteries 
had not come along, so that it could 
emit a radio signal by which it 
could be tracked. (It must be men- 
tioned that at least one skilled ama- 
teur astronomer on the West Coast 
managed to see the test satellite 
with his telescope, knowing when 
and where it should be in the sky.) 



Without solar batteries, the test 
satellite would be too small to be 
useful. Of course, a 3 Vi pound plas- 
tic and aluminum balloon inflated 
in orbit would be large enough for 
visual tracking, but this is another 
type of satellite again. 

And that is really the point of the 
answer. The optimum size of a 
satellite depends on what it is sup- 
posed to do. Let us take a type of 
satellite which is likely to be large 
and heavy as an example. If we 
want a TV camera in orbit for 
cloud-cover research, we have to 
carry a TV camera. We have to 
carry the broadcasting equipment. 
We have to carry a power source. 
We also have to provide a mecha- 
nism which will steady the satellite 
and aim the camera. There has to 
be a power source for this purpose, 
too. 

What all this will weigh is impos- 
sible for me to estimate. But let’s 
say that one designer can do all 
this at a weight of 2500 pounds. If 
another designer can do it at a 
weight of 1750 pounds and do it 
with equal reliability and for the 
same duration, the second satellite 
is demonstrably superior. 

OW let us take another ex- 

' ample of lighter weight. We 
want a bunch of radiation counters 
in orbit, say a dozen. One of them 
should be completely unshielded; 
the others shielded to different de- 
grees with different lead shields. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



107 



The unshielded counter will report 
all radiation. The one with the 
heaviest lead shielding will report 
only the most energetic sub-atomic 
particles. The ten counters in be- 
tween will report different energy 
levels of the particles that hit them. 
All this has to be broadcast to the 
ground, to be sure, so a transmitter 
is needed. The overall weight of 
this would probably be on the order 
of 30 pounds. 

If, in the TV satellite, the rocket 
had originally been built for the 
2500-pound design, but in the 
meantime the 1750-pound design 
had come along, we would now 
have enough spare payload to add 
several sets of the radiation coun- 
ter assembly and get all the meas- 
urements we want with the one 
heavy satellite. Wouldn’t we? 

No, we wouldn’t. 

We’d get measurements, all 
right, but only from the orbit that 
is the best for TV cloud-cover 
measurements, which might be an 
orbit that is nearly circular and 
4000 miles away. But we want such 
radiation count from many places. 
We want an orbit that is nearly cir- 
cular and quite low, say 200 miles 
on the average. We also want this 
orbit to go over both magnetic 
poles. Then we want an orbit that 
is also nearly circular, but over the 
equator, and, on the average, 1500 
miles from the ground. Then we 
want an orbit which is over the 
equator but quite eccentric, with a 



perigee at perhaps 200 miles and 
an apogee 6000 miles away. 

In short, we want several differ- 
ent orbits for the same type satel- 
lite. Which simply means that we 
need as many satellites as there are 
orbits worth investigating. Offhand, 
I can think of about ten different 
orbits just for radiation measure- 
ments. This figure does not include 
possible failures (and in this case 
a satellite that goes into an orbit, 
but not one of the desired ones, 
might be counted as a failure ) and 
repeats. Repeats will be necessary 
because the measurements should 
cover a number of years to provide 
a really complete and reliable pic- 
ture. 

Even if these satellites do a few 
other things in addition to radiation 
measurements (such as taking their 
own temperatures and reporting on 
hits by micro-meteorites), they can 
still be quite small. For exploratory 
purposes, and that is the phase at 
which we are now, several small 
satellites are infinitely superior to 
one large one. Large ones will be 
needed too, if the equipment they 
have to carry happens to be heavy, 
but for quite some time to come, 
they will not replace the small ones. 

THE AUSTRALIAN 
SHOE SIZE PUZZLE 

^ I ^ O end all this on a somewhat 
lighter note, let me recall a 
luncheon in Chicago with advertis- 



108 



GALAXY 



ing and newspaper people where 
the so-called Australian shoe size 
puzzle came up. This does not 
mean that shoe sizes in Australia 
are puzzling, at least no more than 
an 3 Twhere else, but that it was 
thought up in Australia. 

One of the men present had just 
heard it from an Australian adver- 
tising man. It ran as follows: 

“Miss S.,” he said, “don’t tell us 
your shoe size, but think of it and 
double the number.” 

Miss S. nodded, wondering what 
would come next 

“If this is an even number, leave 
it alone. If it is an odd number, sub- 
tract one.” 

“Even,” said Miss S. 

“All right, now add 39 to this 
number.” 

Miss S. nodded. 

“Now multiply this by five.” 

At that point. Miss S. fished a 
pencil out of her purse and started 
defacing the back of a menu. 

“When you have the result, write 
it down and tack an eight onto it, 
like another digit. This should be 
a four-digit figure now.” 

Miss S. indicated that it was. 
“Now subtract the year in which 
you were bom from this figure. 
What’s the result?” 

She read off a figure which 
sounded as if it made absolutely 



no sense, after all these op)erations. 

But the man who had started 
the whole thing smiled and said: 
“So you wear a size five, which is 
about what I guessed, but I didn’t 
know you are thirty.” 

TT so happened that Miss S. did 
not mind this information 
being divulged, but by then every- 
body wanted to see the procedure 
in detail, so she had to go through 
the sequence once more. 

Size 5 doubled makes 10. (If it 
had been size 5^^, the resulting 
odd figure, 11, would have had to 
be reduced by one.) Adding 39 
makes 49. Multiplied by five makes 
245. Tack on an 8 at the end and 
you get 2458. Subtract the year of 
birth (1928) makes 530, which is 
size 5, age 30. 

Several more menus were then 
spoiled and it always worked out 
neatly. This is as far as the pro- 
ceedings went on that day. I expect 
that more paper will be spoiled now 
in a number of homes, so I’ll give a 
hint. The conversation took place 
in 1958 and an “8” had to be tacked 
on at the end. Since you’ll be doing 
this in 1959, you’ll have to tack on 
a “9” or else every victim’s age will 
come out one year younger than it 
really is.

Y ou remember Regan. He’s 
the man who fell overboard 
in a spacesuit and found 
that there really is a passage to 
India. It winds down from the 
Champion Deep in the Atlantic 
and comes out somewhere off Bom- 
bay. It took Regan a week to pop 
in one end of that underworld river 
and emerge at the other. He was 
delirious when he bobbed to the 
surface and was picked up by the 
Chinese motorship. Starved, of 
course; had to spend a long time in 
the hospital after he’d been trans- 
ferred to shore. 

The newspapers and radio and 
television made quite a thing of it. 
Reporters managed to interview 
Regan while he was still weak and 
maybe talking a little crazy. They 
got together afterward and agreed 
among themselves on what parts to 
leave out. Then Regan sold the 
first-person rights to a syndicate. 
He insisted on writing the install- 
ments himself, but a lot was edited 
out while the staff writer was re- 
doing it. 

I didn’t hear Regan’s unpublished 
story till I met him in the bar at 
the Palmer House in Chicago. He’d 
been attending a geophysical meet- 
ing that I’d had to cover and we’d 
both got bored with it about the 
same time. I thought I recognized 
him from his pictures and said so. 
Regan seemed glad to have a non- 
longhair to talk to, and he talked. 
You know why Regan had been 




Illustrated by DILLON 



111 



wearing a spacesuit in the first 
place; he’d become something of a 
hero on the return trip of one of the 
Earth-Mars hops after a meteor 
struck. Regan went out through the 
airlock to make repairs. It was his 
job as chief of maintenance. 
Patched up the hole and went back 
in. Routine, he said. 

But the skipper messaged a re- 
port to Earth, and when the space- 
ship reached the way station to 
take on landing fuel, the press was 
waiting for it. The photographers 
were along and they wanted Regan 
to re-enact the repair scene. He 
didn’t want to, but the skipper in- 
sisted because it would be good 
public relations. So Regan climbed 
into the spacesuit again and took 
along his mobile repair gear and 
tinkered away on the hull while 
the photogs snapped away from a 
patrol boat. 

That was when the repair unit 
went out of whack. 

T TS mobility factor wasn’t sup- 
posed to do anything more than 
move him around on the hull to 
wherever he had to go. He’d 
worked with it a hundred times in 
test sessions and once in reality and 
it’d always been a lamb. But this 
time it went all screwy and shoved 
him off the hull. In some way one 
of the conduits wrapped itself 
around his arms like an octopus, 
pinning them so he couldn’t reach 
the controls. And in some other 



way the tiny rocket engine zipped 
over to full power and plunged him 
down toward Earth. 

If it had headed him out toward 
space, it would have been all right. 
The patrol boat could have over- 
taken him in a few hours at most 
and hauled him aboard. But Regan 
was heading Earthward and soon 
he was down where the traffic’s 
pretty congested. The patrol boat 
made some valiant efforts, but 
after a couple of near misses with 
transcontinental rockets, it gave up. 
Better to lose one person than a 
couple of hundred. 

Radio messages were sent to low- 
flying craft and ships at sea. These 
didn’t do any good, except that a 
trawler was able to spot the posi- 
tion where Regan, in his spacesuit, 
smacked the water and went under. 
The trawler didn’t have a radio 
transmitter. It waited a while, and 
when nothing came up, it put about 
for land. A day later, the spot where 
Regan had gone down was alive 
with would-be rescue ships, sub- 
marines and diving equipment. 

But Regan never came up — not 
in that ocean, at any rate. 

I knew this story pretty well, so 
Regan didn’t elaborate on it. He’d 
blacked out, anyway, soon after he 
hit the atmosphere and didn’t come 
to till he was close to smacking the 
surface. That’s when it began to 
get interesting. 

You’ve seen enough undersea 
movies to know what the ocean is 



112 



GALAXY 



like, so we won’t go into that. This 
is what happened when Regan got 
down to what should have been the 
bottom; 

There was a big crater there, 
with the bottom stretching away 
in all directions from the cavity — 
but the hole itself kept going down. 
Funnel-shaped, Regan said. He 
could see it quite clearly because 
he was plunging into it head down. 
The tentacles of the conduit were 
still wrapped around his arms and 
the mobility gadget’s rocket was 
naturally working almost as well 
under water as it had in space. 

After a while, it got dark, with 
Regan still zipping along into the 
depths of the funnel. He’d long 
since passed the stage of being 
merely worried; now he was scared. 
By this time, it was entirely black, 
but Regan could sense that he was 
being carried along swiftly. 

TV OT because he thought it 

' would do any good, but be- 
cause he had to do something, 
Regan experimented with his feet. 
He found that after some back- 
stretching calisthenics he was able 
to bring his right boot up near his 
waist. Maneuvering it with total 
disregard for his sacroiliac, Regan 
managed to hook the boot under 
one of the coils the conduit had 
made around him. Gradually he 
was able to loosen it enough to give 
his left arm some play and from 
there it was relatively simple. He 



switched off the rocket engine, 
switched on his headlamp and 
looked around. 

Regan said it was quite a sight, 
in a reverse sort of way. Nothing 
anywhere. With the rocket turned 
off, he kind of floated around aim- 
lessly, going nowhere in particular. 
He should have been going up, but 
that didn’t happen. He swirled 
like a lazy eddy. A school of things 
that were caricatures of fish — big, 
white, revolting things — swished 
over and puckered blindly into his 
faceplate, then went away. Other- 
wise there was nothing. 

Regan was pretty discouraged. 
By this time, he’d been in a slow 
spin for so long that he had no 
idea which way was up. He had the 
equipment for getting up — there 
were about two hundred hours of 
fuel in the rocket engine strapped 
to his back — but no way seemed 
any better than another. 

He remembered that the funnel 
had steadily narrowed and so he 
tried experimental bursts from the 
engine to see if he could reach one 
of the sides. Eventually he got to 
something that wasn’t water. It was 
a sort of mud. Regan studied the 
markings on it for a possible clue. 
No go. Regan was a spaceman, not 
an oceanographer. 

So, since it was better than doing 
nothing, Regan got himself into a 
drift parallel with the mud side 
and switched on his rocket. 

He whizzed along at a good rate, 

113 



TRAVELING COMPANION WANTED 



staying close to the mud wall, but 
not knowing whether he was going 
down, up or around in circles at 
the same depth. After what he 
judged to be some hours of this, the 
mud began to be streaked with a 
gray substance and, still farther 
along, it appeared to become rock. 
Regan didn’t know whether this 
was good or bad. 

More hours went by, apparently. 
Regan was wearing a watch, but it 
was hidden under the heavy sleeve 
of his spacesuit. He dozed off, he 
said, and when he snapped back 
into consciousness he noticed that 
there was another wall, far off, op- 
posite the one he was rocketing 
along. 

It was gray, too, as far as he 
could make out in the light of his 
headlamp, which was weak over 
distances. What woke him up fully 
was something that went skimming 
past him at a much greater rate 
than his own. It was a cask, its 
wood brown as if from long sub- 
mersion and its hoops rusted into 
redness. The cask was turning 
lazily end over end, but it outdis- 
tanced him and disappeared ahead 
as he watched. It had been travel- 
ing out in the middle of the passage. 

EGAN pondered this for a 
while and then reasoned that 
there was a swift current, swifter 
in the middle even than his rocket 
propulsion at the side of the chan- 
nel. He worked himself out toward 



the center, then switched off his 
rocket, experimentally. By watch- 
ing the rock side of the passage, he 
•was able to gauge that he was 
moving much faster. 

The watching, however, had a 
hypnotic effect on him and Regan 
felt himself dozing off. He tried to 
fight it but reasoned finally that 
there wasn’t much point. So he 
turned off his headlamp and let 
himself go to sleep. 

He felt v/eird when he woke up. 
He was hot and sweating. He re- 
membered instantly where he was. 
It was no comfort to him. He felt 
entirely hopeless, even more so 
than if he’d been marooned in 
space. At least there was traffic out 
there. Here there was just himself, 
with a wooden cask up ahead and 
nightmarish fish somewhere be- 
hind. 

He also felt weak. Spacesuits 
come equipped with water, of 
course, if they’re the repair variety, 
and Regan drank sparingly through 
the tube at the base of his face- 
plate. But his suit carried no ra- 
tions, so "he tried to ignore his 
hunger. 

He drowsed again and switched 
off his headlamp. This became a 
pattern for him — a semi-conscious 
nightmare of smooth, eerie motion, 
punctuated with sips at his water 
supply and hopeless watching 
through the faceplate, blinking 
away the sweat. Regan talked to 
himself, he said, and sometimes 



114 



GALAXY 



sang, to keep himself sane in the 
silence and loneliness. It probably 
helped, although some of his talk 
was pretty idiotic. 

It was after one of his dozes — 
whose duration he had no way of 
measuring even by his thirst and 
hunger, which were constant — that 
he awoke to something new. Auto- 
matically he switched on his head- 
lamp, then switched it off again, 
realizing what the newness was. 

The passage he was being 
washed through was no longer 
dark; there was a radiance in the 
water now. 

Regan twisted himself around to 
see what the light came from. Up 
ahead, apparently. As it got 
stronger, his eyes began to ache. It 
was a gorgeous ache, Regan said, 
and he stared ahead almost hypno- 
tized. He made an effort and fo- 
cused on the walls of the passage- 
way he was being thrust along. 
They were white with streaks of 
black in them — like marble, but 
without marble’s glossy hardness. 
He could see all parts of the tunnel 
now; it was roughly circular and 
had narrowed to a diameter of 
about two hundred feet 

Regan could only suppose that 
he was nearing the surface — that 
he’d been sweeping through some 
U-shaped fissure — and he adjusted 
himself kinesthetically to the 
theory that he was now traveling 
up instead of down. This took a 
lot of doing and occupied his mind. 



His spirits soared with his imag- 
ined ascent and he could visualize 
himself traveling faster and faster 
until, with a pop, he would be 
thrust into the air and fall back to 
float on the surface. Regan wanted 
most desperately to be able to look 
at the sky again. It would be kind 
to see land, too, but a ship or a 
plane would do temporarily. 

T¥E was half lost in this reverie 
when he had to make a sec- 
ond adjustment. Remember, he 
thought he was going up, as from 
the bottom of a well. Therefore he 
was puzzled, as the radiance in- 
creased to daylight strength, to see 
one wall of his tubular, water-filled 
prison darken to deep green while 
the other turned a sort of blue- 
white-pink. 

He was moving in the same swift 
rush of current, his body positioned 
so that he was facing the green 
half. He twisted as if to face the 
opposite way in an elevator and 
then became giddy when the entire 
concept of his surroundings did a 
ninety-degree flop. 

In that split second, Regan real- 
ized that he wasn’t traveling ver- 
tically, but horizontally. 

The well he had pictured him- 
self in now took on the aspect of a 
river, with the bright blend of col- 
ors the sky, and the deep green the 
river bed. The banks of the river 
were above him. Regan gave him- 
self a tiny rocket assist to rise.

He wasn’t at all prepared for 
what he saw. Far away beyond the 
green plain through which the river 
was racing was a city. 

Unmistakably it was a metropo- 
lis of Man, not towering or tur- 
reted, but massive and with a rela- 
tive newness which spoke of life. 
And as he had this thought, he 
could see other, smaller dwellings 
closer by, one-storied and circular, 
in a variety of colors. 

He noted then that the level of 
the river was higher than that of 
the land, that the marblelike banks 
which channeled the racing water 
had become a transparent, glass- 
like substance which rose and 
curved in a seemingly endless arch- 
way. The torrent completely filled 
the half-transparent tube, flowing 
smoothly so that he almost had the 
sensation of flying above the 
ground. 

Regan maneuvered toward the 
top and from there he saw the 
road. It paralleled the river and 
ran in a straight line as far as he 
could see. While he watched, a ve- 
hicle sped along it from behind, 
paced beside him and then pulled 
ahead. The driver was only vaguely 
visible, but he had a reassuringly 
human appearance. The man in the 
car, which was a three-wheeled, 
boxlike affair of brilliant yellow, 
looked neither left nor right. 

Regan yelled instinctively and 
waved. The cumbersome motion 
turned him over on his back. Op- 



portunistically, he studied the sky 
from his new position, but could 
make nothing of it. There were no 
clouds, only the blue-white-pink 
brightness that seemed to extend to 
infinity. 

^ OMETHING flashed across his 
^ field of vision. Regan caught 
only a glimpse of it, then reasoned 
that it must have been a bridge, 
spanning the enclosed river. He 
twisted himself around to a prone 
position and tried to think con- 
structively. 

Somewhere there had to be an 
exit to this land. For his sake, there 
had to be, although of course this 
guaranteed nothing. But surely 
these people made use of this abun- 
dant supply of water. It would be 
fresh and good to drink after its 
long passage through the Earth, 
despite its source in the salt ocean. 
They would use it for irrigation, 
probably, and perhaps somewhere 
it was channeled for transportation 
— of a more comfortable kind than 
his own. And they might use it 
for power. Certainly its rushing 
strength would be tapped. 

This thought scared him. He 
pictured a giant hydroelectric plant 
into which he would be swept and 
in the bowels of which his body 
would be mangled by the blades of 
a turbine. 

He had to slow his mad passage. 
He maneuvered the equipment at- 
tached to his spacesuit and pointed 



116 



GALAXY 



the rocket exhaust ahead of him. 
He flicked on the power and felt 
his speed being cut. The powerful 
current pressed from behind him 
like a live thing, but the rocket 
thrust was strong, too. His progress 
slackened to the pace of a canoe. 

Balancing himself behind the 
makeshift braking apparatus was 
difficult, both bepause the torrent 
threatened constantly to turn him 
end for end, and because his 
strength was only a memory of 
itself. But somehow Regan man- 
aged to achieve an equilibrium 
which allowed him to look about 
and reassure himself that the city 
was still there. Its position had 
shifted on the horizon to a point 
slightly behind him, but there ap- 
parently was no end to the ex- 
panse of this underground world. 
The road was there, too, still paral- 
lel to the roofed-over river. 

A surge of hope went through 
him as he spotted a man walking 
along the road. 

Regan braked himself still fur- 
ther, until his speed matched that 
of the man. The man’s costume 
was a brief one — knee-length 
trousers, a vestlike garment over a 
white skin, and sandals — so ap- 
parently the climate was tropical. 

Regan stared hard at the man, 
mutely begging him to turn. Both 
Regan’s hands gripped the rocket 
tube; he didn’t dare let go to wave. 
Then, as though he had been 
reached telepathically, the man 



looked in Regan’s direction. Regan 
couldn’t make out his expression, 
but apparently it was one of dis- 
belief. The man stopped, took an 
indecisive step and then ran toward 
the river. He jogged alongside it 
and now Regan could see his face 
clearly. 

T T was an intelligent face— round, 
broad-nosed, the eyes almond- 
shaped and the hair abundant and 
black. The man’s body was stocky 
and powerful, graceful as he ran 
beside the tubed-in river. He 
waved and smiled, and Regan 
hoped his own answering smile 
was visible behind the faceplate of 
his spacesuit. 

Regan doubted that telepathy 
had anything to do with making 
the man notice him originally; 
nevertheless, he thought furiously: 
“How do I get out of here?” 

The response was made more 
to Regan’s obvious predicament 
than because of thought transfer- 
ence, he was sure; at any rate, the 
man pointed, then raced ahead. 

Regan lost sight of him for an 
agonizingly long minute or two, 
then saw him again, standing and 
pointing up. Another bridge was 
spanning the river. The man ges- 
tured to it emphatically, then 
pointed ahead again and held up 
two fingers. Alternately he pointed 
to the bridge and gestured with his 
fingers. Regan decided that this 
meant there would be some sort of 



TRAVELING COMPANION WANTED 



117 



help for him at the second bridge 
beyond. He nodded his head vigor- 
ously. 

The man seemed to see the mo- 
tion. He nodded and smiled. 

Regan cut the power of the 
rocket engine and let the current 
speed his journey. The man outside 
increased his own pace, and when 
another bridge swept overhead, he 
nodded and held up one finger. 
Regan trembled with relief at this 
confirmation of the pantomimed 
message. He fought back the weari- 
ness that had begun to creep over 
him again, and clung doggedly to 
the rocket whose exhaust regulated 
his speed to that of the running 
man. 

Regan thought the bridge would 
never be reached. He felt supreme- 
ly weary. He was sopping wet, his 
eyes kept going out of focus, his 
throat ached, and his head was 
throbbing with jagged pains. It 
took all his waning strength to cling 
to consciousness. 

INALLY the bridge was in 
sight; then overhead. The run- 
ning man pointed up. Beyond the 
bridge, the glasslike covering ended. 

Regan was out of the tunnel. 

The river widened now and its 
velocity eased. But the current was 
still a powerful one. Regan pointed 
the rocket tube so that it thrust him 
upward. His rubber- and steel- 
clothed head broke the surface. He 
felt a surge of freedom. 



In his joy, Regan lost control of 
the rocket-brake and was twisted 
crazily about. Instinctively he shut 
off the power; he was swept ahead. 
As the river whirled him forward, 
he saw the man on the bank point 
ahead to the right, wave him on and 
gesture that he would catch up 
later. 

It was with relief that Regan let 
himself be carried forward by the 
strong current. He was traveling 
out of the mainstream now. In a 
few minutes, the river was so broad 
that he seemed to be barely mov- 
ing, but this was merely an illusion 
of contrast. 

Then Regan saw the mesh fence. 
It was a giant strainer across the 
river, apparently fashioned to pre- 
vent debris from being carried into 
the structure which straddled the 
river beyond — without doubt the 
hydroelectric plant whose exist- 
ence he had dreaded. 

Regan was swept into the fence. 
It gave, cushioning the shock, and 
he pulled himself along it toward 
the bank. He reached it but lacked 
the strength to pull himself onto 
land. 

Nearby, hugging the huge mesh 
fence, was the cask which had 
passed him back in the dark of the 
tunnel. 

Just as Regan was passing out, 
he saw the stocky man in the knee- 
length shorts come into sight, run- 
ning as fast as he could make his 
legs pump.

T¥7 HEN Regan came to, he 
found himself being carried on 
the back of an open truck. He was 
lying there like a sack of cabbages, 
being bounced around as the truck 
sped over a bumpy road. His un- 
dersea friend was squatting next to 
him on the bed of the truck, hold- 
ing onto the side to keep from being 
jolted off. 

He smiled when he saw that 
Regan had regained consciousness 
and patted the chest of the space- 
suit. He pointed in the direction the 
truck was going, but Regan was flat 
on his back and weak and couldn’t 
turn to look. The jolting was mak- 
ing him sick. 

The road became smoother and 
soon they entered the city. Regan 
said it was the damnedest place he 
ever saw. Everything looked like 
a beehive. He meant that literally, 
he said. All the buildings were cir- 
cular, with doors down at the base 
and no windows. They were all dif- 
ferent sizes and all colors. Some of 
the bigger ones towered up pretty 
high, but just how high was hard 
to say. They weren’t built in stories, 
but in one continuous curving line 
from bottom to top. 

The truck would pass through a 
square or a park now and again and 
the buildings in the distance looked 
like a mass of soap bubbles, all pas- 
tel colors under that blue-white- 
pink sky. The truck stopped in 
front of a big yellow beehive. Now 
that he was close and not being 



jolted around, Regan could see that 
the building was constructed of a 
kind of oversized bricks, about a 
foot square. They weren’t joined 
with mortar, as far as he could tell. 
Apparently their own weight and 
shape held them together as they 
rose up and formed a dome. And 
the color was within the bricks, not 
painted on. 

Two men, taller than his friend, 
came out of the building carrying 
a plank. They loaded Regan onto 
it and carried him stretcher-fashion 
into the building. The friend tagged 
along behind. 

There was a sort of anteroom in- 
side, with a man at a desk. The 
bearers stopped while the man took 
down a gadget that looked like a 
chessboard with buttons and 
pushed down half a dozen of them. 
Then he held out the board to 
Regan’s friend, who pushed down 
some of the buttons in a different 
combination. After that the little 
friend went away, first patting 
Regan on the chest and smiling. 

Regan was carried into a ro- 
tunda in the center of the building. 
The floor rose and took them to the 
top level. The bearers carried him 
off to the side and he saw the floor 
drop down again. They took him 
to a windowless room which had 
light radiating from the walls, and 
dumped him off the plank-stretcher 
onto a high stone table. Regan 
climbed down. He supposed they 
were being as gentle as possible.

considering his great weight in the 
spacesuit. 

Regan’s weight also manifested 
itself to him. He felt the heaviness 
of a person who has been buoyed 
up for a long time in water, but is 
now on land. 

A LL this happened, except for 
the clank as he was set down, 
in complete silence. He was entire- 
ly isolated from outside sound, of 
course. 

He lay there, feeling less sick 
but still hot and dizzy, trying to 
compose his stomach. After a while, 
he felt calm enough to drink a little 
water through the tube inside the 
faceplate. 

A rotimd man wearing a kind of 
white tunic came into his field of 
vision. Regan could see him only 
from the waist up. Like the friend 
he had met at the river, this man 
had abundant black hair. But his 
face was fat, with puffy cheeks and 
sagging jowls. He was much older. 
His hands were pudgy. He wag- 
gled them in what might have been 
a gesture of delight or greeting; it 
was hard to say which. His expres- 
sion was one of pleasure. He stood 
at Regan’s side and smiled at him. 
His hands felt over the headpiece 
of the spacesuit, then went thump- 
ing down the rest of it. 

“I’ll be out of the damn thing 
soon,” Regan thought. But appar- 
ently it was too much for the fel- 
low. Regan tried to gesture to the 



fastening at the back of his neck 
to show how it was done, but he 
was unable to raise his arms. He 
realized then how exhausted he 
was. 

The rotund man in the tunic 
patted him on the chest — it seemed 
to be a universal gesture — and 
went away. 

Regan felt at peace in the room. 
He felt that now he was going to be 
taken care of and that everything, 
somehow, was going to be all right. 
He went to sleep. 

He woke up ravenously hungry. 
He seemed to be alone in the room. 
His encased body felt as heavy as 
the whole world. He tried to raise 
up to bring his mouth to the water 
tube. He couldn’t. He cried out in 
a voice that was weak even inside 
the confines of his suit. No one 
could possibly have heard and no 
one came. He tried to raise his arm. 
The muscles strained and quivered. 
By using all his strength, he was 
able to lift it a few inches above the 
table. Then the arm fell back on 
the stone with the barest tap of 
sound. 

The jovial fat one reappeared. 
He was carrying a metal box with 
two dials on it and wires coming 
from it which ended in kinds of suc- 
tion cups. He stuck one of the cups 
to Regan’s faceplate, fastened an- 
other one to his ear and twirled a 
dial. 

“Please get me out of this suit,” 
Regan said. 



120

The man’s face lit up with pleas- 
ure. He nodded and patted the 
chest of the suit. Then he spoke. 

The language was a guttural, 
fast-paced one. Regan had never 
heard anything like it. 

“Please,” he said. “Please get me 
out.” 

The man continued to smile. He 
beckoned and two other men ap- 
peared. They took turns listening 
to Regan plead to be released. 
They smiled, too, though obviously 
none of them understood a word. 
Without gestures, it was impossible 
for Regan to convey his plight. 

HEY stood around him, chat- 
tering in their outlandish 
tongue. Others joined them. They 
all had the same look about them. 
Friendly, smiling faces and hands 
that patted him on the chest. It be- 
came a confused nightmare as still 
others streamed in, as if he were the 
main attraction in a fifty-cent tour. 

But apparently there was 
method in their milling around. 
They measured him from top to 
toe, from side to side, in circum- 
ference and in depth. They used 
steel tapes and calipers and jotted 
down their findings in little books 
or punched them out on button- 
studded chessboards. They wheeled 
in a huge contraption which must 
have been a camera and clicked it 
at him from every angle. They 
lifted his arms and legs and chat- 
tered with excitement to see how 



peculiarly he bent at the joints. 

It was as if Regan were a new 
kind of animal that had swum into 
their ken and which they were 
classifying, or which they would 
classify at their leisure after they 
had measured it in all possible 
ways. 

They kept it up for an eternity 
and a half. Regan’s vision got hazy, 
his throat burned and his stomach 
ached in irregular spasms. 

He was barely conscious when 
the two bearers came back in, 
loaded him on the plank and took 
him out into the rotunda. The 
throng of scientists followed. The 
floor-wide elevator sank to the 
main level and they all went out 
into the street. 

A big, rectangular, doorless, bus- 
like vehicle was standing there. The 
bearers, with a great deal of effort, 
propped Regan up in the front seat. 
His head lolled back inside the suit. 
The shift in position blacked him 
cut temporarily. He came out of a 
period of nausea to hear himself 
saying over and over: 

“You open it at the back of the 
neck. I’d do it myself if I could 
move my arms. You open it at the 
back of the neck.” 

The bus was in motion. It rum- 
bled through the streets among the 
pastel beehives. In Regan’s state, 
they were so many bouncing bal- 
loons being pointed out by madmen 
in white smocks in a caricature of 
a vehicle under an impossible sky. 



122 



GALAXY 



They eventually reached a kind 
of park or estate. Shrubs and trees 
were neatly set out and a big golden 
beehive stood at the end of a long 
drive. They took him inside, half 
fainting, sweating, gibbering to him- 
self. 

Through half a dozen anterooms 
they went, to what could only have 
been a throne room. It was sump- 
tuously hung with tapestries. There 
were guards standing at post and 
a thick carpet led to a dais on which 
were two huge chairs. A tall, slen- 
der, dark-haired man sat in one of 
them. The other was empty. 

There was a confused kind of 
ceremony in which everyone got 
down on one knee before the man 
on the throne, and a ridiculous 
struggle began, to get Regan into a 
semblance of the same position. 

The king, or whatever he was, 
gestured, and Regan found him- 
self being dragged up on the dais 
and sat on the other throne. 

Then the nightmare took a turn 
for the worse. From an ante- 
room came a procession of women 
bearing gifts. They were the first 
women Regan had seen in this un- 
derground world, but he was less 
interested in them than in what 
they carried. 

Food. 

Baskets of fruit. 

Platters of meat. 

Cups of liquids. 

The smiling creatures curtsied 
before the thrones and set out the 



feast in front of Regan. One of 
them, dressed in a single pale blue 
garment belted at the waist, laid a 
basket of fruit in his lap. 

Regan began to quiver in a fever 
of frustration. 

It got worse when, at a sign from 
the king, everyone helped himself 
to some of this or that, raised it to 
Regan in a kind of toast and began 
to eat. 

If any of them noticed that 
Regan didn’t join them, they were 
polite enough not to take offense. 

^ I ^ HE feast over, everyone went 
for an after-dinner ride. The 
king went, too, riding in a richly 
draped palanquin on wheels, ahead 
of the squared-off bus. 

This was the royal tour. Points 
of interest were visited. Regan’s 
bleary eyes and uncomprehending 
brain half observed gardens, fac- 
tories, schools, a sporting event, a 
parade, a farm and dozens of 
examples of the culture of the 
world of people who were kindly 
starving him to death. 

In his semi-delirium, he once re- 
proached himself for being such an 
unappreciative guest and won- 
dered what they must think of this 
emissary from outside who was 
such a cumbersome clod. He had 
come to them in the strange trap- 
pings he apparently preferred, so 
how could he blame them for re- 
specting his costume and leaving it 
to him to wear it or remove it as

he chose? In his own world, he 
wouldn’t strip a visitor or skin a 
stray dog. 

A bump in the road and the 
shudder it gave the bus jolted his 
eyes fully open. Ahead was the 
hydroelectric plant spanning the 
river. They were going to show the 
king where Regan had come from. 

The procession pulled over to 



the bank next to the mesh fence 
which screened debris from the 
water flowing into the plant. On the 
bank lay his mobility unit, which 
apparently had been detached be- 
fore they trucked him into the city 
originally. The king got out of his 
palanquin and examined it curi- 
ously. Then he got back in and they 
drove along the bank to the other

side of the hydroelectric plant The 
river continued its swift passage, 
apparently unslowed by the drain 
on it. 

Regan thought the river looked 
tremendously inviting. In its 
depths, he could be free of the well- 
meaning crowd of sightseeing 
guides. The river represented 
peace, an end to being shown 



around, measured, observed, ex- 
hibited and tantalized. In it, he 
could die calmly, without any frus- 
trating diplomacy. 

A bridge spanned the river be- 
low the plant. By the gestures of 
the scientists, he gathered that they 
were going to cross over to see in- 
teresting things which lay across 
the river. The bridge was a narrow 



TRAVELING COMPANION WANTED 



125 



wooden one. Parallel to it was the 
stone framework of an unfinished 
replacement. They proceeded slow- 
ly over the rickety, railless bridge. 

The approach to it was banked, 
so that Regan was tilted in his seat, 
toward the outside. The bus leveled 
off as it reached the wooden plank- 
ing and Regan tilted the other way. 
A loose plank under a wheel sent 
him swaying back again. With all 
his remaining strength, he leaned 
with the tilt. It was just enough to 
send him off balance. 

They reached out to pull him 
back, but it was too late. He was 
out of the bus and dropping the 
short distance to the water. 

The current was so swift that 
he went only a little way under, 
then bobbed up and was rushed 
along, turning over and over. As he 
revolved, he caught glimpses of 
consternation on the bridge. He 
saw the bus back off and race along 
the road on the bank, hands waving 
out of it. But it couldn’t catch up 
with him. He was moving too fast. 

The even motion of the river was 
soothing. Regan took a swallow 
from his tube and relaxed. There 
was a dull ache in his stomach, but 
no more stabbing spasms. Maybe 
he was dying. He didn’t care. 

"O EGAN knew he was in a hos- 
pital even before he opened 
his eyes. The ether-and-disinfect- 
ant smell told him that. 

It was taking an effort to thrust 



his eyelids up. He moved his arms 
and felt them close to his body. 
He raised one hand to his face and 
rubbed his closed eyes. Of course 
they’d have got him out of the 
spacesuit. 

He opened his eyes. 

A brown-faced man was lean- 
ing over the bed. He was wearing 
a white smock and had a fountain 
pen in the breast pocket. Beyond 
the man — the doctor — there was 
a window. A perfectly ordinary 
window, through which Regan 
could see the sky. A blue sky with 
white clouds in it. 

The doctor smiled at Regan and 
said in English: “How do you feel, 
son?” 

Regan tried to speak but 
couldn’t. 

“This is Bombay,” the doctor 
said. “Bombay, in India. It must be 
quite a surprise to you, but I’m 
glad to say you’ll be all right.” 

“What?” Regan asked vaguely. 

“It’s strange, of course,” said the 
doctor. “You should be on the other 
side of the world, by all that’s 
natural. We communicated with 
the American authorities when we 
saw your identification. It is ex- 
tremely odd. Still, here you are, and 
you will be well. Quite soon, too.” 

“But—” Regan began. Then he 
gave up. He said nothing more un- 
til after he’d eaten and slept and 
the doctor asked him if he felt 
strong enough now to see the re- 
porters.

more, sir?” the barten- 
der at the Palmer House 

asked. 

I nodded. 

“Naturally they thought I was 
delirious,” Regan said, “or had 
been. They had to accept the fact 
that I’d been through the Earth. 
Not through the center of it, or 
an3Twhere near it — they tell me 
thafs practically solid nickel, or 
molten, or whatever. But there was 
no disputing that I’d gone down in 
the Atlantic and come up in the 
Indian Ocean. They’d seen me go 
down and they’d seen me come up 
and obviously I’d been somewhere 
in the interval. I hadn’t walked, 
that was for sure. 

“They credited my story of the 
underground river. The Greeks had 
a word for it, they tell me. The 
Greeks thought the Alpheus River 
wandered down under the Adriatic 
and came up in Sicily. I don’t know 
much about their river, but mine 
apparently follows the Earth’s 
curve maybe a dozen miles below 
the surface. 

“But nobody wanted any part of 
my story of the city and the king 
and the beehive houses and the rec- 
tangular bus. Delirium, they said. 
Oh, they were kind about it, but 
they said it. So did the geophysical 
boys upstairs, in their eight-syl- 
labled way.” 

The bartender brought fresh 
highballs, but Regan still held the 
glass the old drink had been in. He 



put it on its side on the bar and 
stared at the open end. I got the 
image — a tunnel filled with rush- 
ing water, a tunnel under the world. 

Regan almost echoed my 
thoughts. 

“Tunnel under the Antarctic,” 
he said half to himself. “That’s 
where it must have been, that city. 
Down there, deep under the ice. 
Used to be tropics, you know.” 
“The Antarctic?” I said. 

“Before the ice came, before the 
Earth’s axis shifted. Those people 
— they didn’t evacuate, I guess. 
They went underground. Funny 
they should have built themselves 
houses the same shape as those of 
the Eskimos who stayed above- 
ground in the North — like igloos. 
But probably that’s just coinci- 
dence. You don’t find igloos in the 
tropics. I’d guess their beehive 
houses are naturally influenced by 
the cavern they live in — their little 
universe.”

and set the empty glass up- 
right on the bar. “I’ve had a lot of

if I’d been able to climb out of 
that damn spacesuit. In time, I 
could even have communicated 
with them passably well. Good- 
looking women, too.”

again, then smiled and shook his 
head. 

I said it for him: “You’re going 
back.” 

“Yes,” he answered. “Yes, I’m 
going back. I know the coordinates 
of the entrance to the passageway 
and its dimensions and the kind of 
equipment I’ll need. Nothing elab- 
orate. In another year or so, I’ll 
have enough saved up, I think. Get 
myself a little space launch; one 
of the smaller ones, lifeboat size. 
Fit it out with food and water — 
and some picture books, of course, 
to show them what it’s like where 
I come from. I’d take somebody 
along with me if I could find any- 
one who wanted to go — and who 
believed me.” 



“I believe you,” I said. “But—” 

“Sure. You’d be crazy to go. Wife 
and kids. I’ve got none of that 
Mostly what I want to do, I guess, 
is prove those longbeards upstairs 
are cockeyed.” 

“I hope you do. Maybe ,you’ll let 
me write about it when you get 
back.” 

“It’ll be a good story,” Regan as- 
sured me. 

“I’ll be waiting for it,” I prom- 
ised. 

That was five years ago. Four 
years ago, Regan went, as he said 
he would. He went alone, in a little 
space launch. 

I’m still waiting to write the end 
of the story.

and IX and the racial-sex “music” 
which is common on those planets. 

All dates have been made con- 
formable with the Terran Calendar 
(as in the standard Terran edition 
of the Almanack) by application 
of Winstock Benjamin’s Least 
Square Variable Time Scale. 

FEBRUARY 17 : Today marks 
the birth date of Freem Freem, of 
Dubhe IV, perhaps the most cele- 
brated child prodigy in musical 
history. Though it is, of course, true 
that he appeared in no concerts af- 
ter the age of twelve, none who 
have seen the solidographs of his 
early performances can ever forget 
the intent face, the tense, accurate 
motions of the hands, the utter per- 
fection of Freem’s entire perform- 
ance. 




His first concert, given at the age 
of four, was an amazing spectacle. 
Respected critics refused to believe 
that Freem was as young as his 
manager (an octopoid from Fomal- 
haut) claimed, and were satisfied 



only by the sworn affidavit of 
Glerk, the well-known Sirian, who 
was present at the preliminary in- 
terviews. 

Being a Sirian, Glerk was natu- 
rally incapable of dissimulation, 
and his earnest supersonics soon 
persuaded the critics of the truth. 
Freem was, in actuality, only four 
years old. 

In the next eight years, Freem 
concertized throughout the Galaxy. 
His triumph on Deneb at the age 
of six, the stellar reception given 
him by a deputation of composers 
and critics from the Lesser Magel- 
lanic Cloud when he appeared in 
that sector, and the introduction 
(as an encore) of his single com- 
position, the beloved Memories of 
Old Age, are still recalled. 

And then, at the age of eleven, 
Freem’s concerts ceased. Music- 
lovers throughout the Galaxy were 
stunned by the news that their 
famed prodigy would appear no 
longer. At the age of twelve, Freem 
Freem was dead. 

Terrans have never felt this loss 
as deeply as other Galactic races, 
and it is not difficult to see why. 
The standard “year” of Dubhe IV 
equals 300 Earth years; to the 
short-lived Terrans, Freem Freem 
had given his first concert at the 
age of 1200, and had died at the 
ripe old age of 3600 years. 

“Calling a 1200-year-old being 
a child prodigy,” states the Terran 
Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 



130 



GALAXY 



rather tartly, “is the kind of mis- 
statement up with which we shall 
not put.” 

Particularly noteworthy is the 
parallel attitude expressed by the 
inhabitants of Terk I, whose “year” 
is approximately three Terran 
days, to the alleged “short” life of 
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. 

MAY 12 s Wilrik Rotha Rotha 
Delk Shkulma Tik was born on this 
date in 8080. Although he/she is 
renowned both as the creator of 
symphonic music on Wolf XVI and 
as the progenitor of the sole Galac- 
tic Censorship Law which remains 
in effect in this enlightened age, 
very little is actually known about 
the history of that law. 

The full story is, very roughly, 
as follows: 

In 8257, a composition was pub- 
lished by the firm of Scholer and 
Dichs (Sirius), the Concerto for 
Wood-Block and Orchestra by Tik. 
Since this was not only the first 
appearance of any composition by 
Tik, but was in fact the first com- 
position of any kind to see publica- 
tion from his planet of Wolf XVI, 
the musical world was astonished at 
the power, control and mastery the 
piece showed. 

A review which is still extant 
stated: “It is not possible that a 
composition of such a high level of 
organization should be the first to 
proceed from a composer — or from 
an entire planet. Yet we must rec- 

GALACTICK ALMANACK 



ognize the merit and worth of Tik’s 
Concerto, and applaud the force of 
the composer, in a higher degree 
than usual.” 

Even more amazing than the 
foregoing was the speed with which 
Tik’s compositions followed one an- 
other. The Concerto was followed 
by a sonata, Tik’s Took, his/her 
Free-Fall Ballet for Centipedals, 
Lightsl Action] Comrades], a Sym- 
phony, an Imbroglio for Unstrung 
Violin, and fourteen Wolfish Rhap- 
sodies — all within the year] 




Scholars visited Wolf XVI and 
reported once again that there was 
no musical history on the planet. 

Success, fame and money were 
Tik’s. Succeeding compositions 
were received with an amount of 
enthusiasm that would have done 
credit to any musician. 

And Wolf XVI seemed to 
awaken at his/her touch. Within 
ten years, there was a school of 
composition established there, and 
works of astounding complexity 
and beauty came pouring forth. 

131 



The “great flowering,” as it was 
called, seemed to inspire other 
planets as well — to name only a 
few. Dog XII, Goldstone IX and 
Trent II (whose inhabitants, dwell- 
ing underwater for the most part, 
had never had anything like a musi- 
cal history). 

Tik^s own income began to go 
down as the process continued. 
Then the astonishing truth was dis- 
covered. 

Tik was not a composer at all 
— merely an electronics technician! 
He/she had recorded the sounds of 
the planet’s main downtown busi- 
ness center and slowed the record- 
ing to half-speed. Since the inhabi- 
tants of Wolf XVI converse in 
batlike squeals, this slowing re- 
sulted in a series of patterns which 
fell within sonic range, and which 
had all of the scope and the com- 
plexity of music itself. 

The other planets had copied the 
trick and soon the Galaxy was 
glutted with this electronic “mu- 
sic.” The climax came when a 
judge on Paolo III aided in the 
recording of a court trial over which 
he presided. During the two weeks 
of subsonic testimony, speech and 
bustle, he supervised recording ap- 
paratus and, in fact, announced that 
he had performed the actual “ar- 
rangement” involved: speeding up 
the recordings so that the two-week 
subsonic trial became a half-hour 
fantasia. 

The judge lost the subsequent 



election and irrationally placed the 
blame on the recording (which had 
not been well-received by the 
critics). Single-handed, he restored 
the state of pure music by pushing 
through the Galactic Assembly a 
censorship rule requiring that all 
recording companies, musicians, 
technicians and composers be lim- 
ited to the normal sonic range of 
the planet on which they were 
working. 

Tik himself, after the passage of 
this law, eked out a bare living as a 
translator from the supersonic. He 
died, alone and friendliness, in 
9501. 

JUNE 4; The composition, on 
this date, in 8236, of Wladislaw 
Wladislaw’s Concertino for En- 
closed Harp stirs reflections in mu- 
sical minds of the inventor and first 
virtuoso on this instrument, the 
ingenious Barsak Gh. Therwent of 
Canopus XII. Nowadays, with com- 
positions for that instrument as 
common as the chadlas of Gh. 
Therwent’s home planet, we are 
likely to pass over the startling and 
almost accidental circumstance 
that led to his marvelous discovery. 

As a small boy, Gh. Therwent 
was enamored of music and musi- 
cians; he played the g/eep-flute be- 
fore the age of eight and, using his 
hair-thin minor arms, was an ac- 
complished performer on the Irish 
(or small open) harp in his 
fifteenth year. A tendency to con- 



132 



GALAXY 




fuse the strings of the harp with his 
own digital extremities, however, 
seemed serious enough to rule out 
a concert career for the young Ealk, 
and when an Earth-made piano was 
delivered to the home of a neighbor 
who fancied himself a collector of 
baroque instruments, young Gh. 
was among the first to attempt 
playing on it. 

Unfortunately, he could not mus- 
ter pressure sufficient in his sec- 
ondary arms and digits to depress 
the keys; more, he kept slipping 
between them. It was one such slip 
that led to his discovery of the en- 
closed strings at the back of the 
piano (a spinet). 

The subtle sonorities of plucked 
strings at the back of a closed cham- 
ber excited him, and he continued 
research into the instrument in a 
somewhat more organized manner. 
Soon he was able to give a concert 
of music which he himself had ar- 
ranged — and when Wladislaw 
Wladislaw dedicated his composi- 
tion to Gh., the performer’s future 
was assured. 

GALACTICK ALMANACK 



The rest of his triumphant story 
is too well known to repeat here. 
The single observation on Gh. 
Therwenfs playing, however, by 
the composer Ratling, is perhaps 
worthy of note. 

“He don’t play on the white keys, 
and he don’t play on the black 
keys,” said Ratling, with that cul- 
tivated lack of grammar which 
made him famous as an eccentric. 
“He plays in the cracks!” 

JULY 23 : On this date, the 
Hrrshtk Notes were discovered in 
a we/f-shop cellar on Deneb III. 

These notes are, quite certainly, 
alone in their originality, and in the 
force which they have had on the 
growth of subsequent musicians. 

To begin at the beginning: it 
is well established that Ludwig 
Hrrshtk, perhaps the most widely 
known Denebian composer, died 
of overwork in his prime. His com- 
positions, until the famous T85 dis- 
coveries of G’g Rash, were almost 
alone in their universal appeal. 
Races the Galaxy over have thrilled 
to Hrrshtk’s Second Symphony, his 
Concerto for Old Men, and the in- 
spiring Classic Mambo Suite. It is, 
as a matter of fact, said that G’g 
Rash himself was led to his discov- 
ery by considering the question : 

“How can many different races, 
experiencing totally different emo- 
tions in totally different ways, agree 
on the importance of a single musi- 
cal composition by Hrrshtk? How 

133 



can all share a single emotional 
experience?” 




His researches delved deeply 
into the Hrrshtk compositions, and 
a tentative theory based on the 

DENEB III TERRA MARS 

Love Anger Hunger 

Hate Joy F’rit 

Prayer Madness Sadness 

Vilb NPE Non-F’rit 

In completed form, the docu- 
ment contains over one hundred 
and fifty separate listings for race, 
and over six hundred separate emo- 
tional or subject headings. In some 
places (like the Terra and Sirius 
listing for Vilb, above), the text is 
marked NPE, and this has been 
taken to mean No Precise Equiva- 
lent. For instance, such a marking 
appears after the Denebian shhr 
for both Terra and Mars, although 
Sirius has the listing ^rk and Fomal- 
haut plarat in the desert. 

Hrrshtk may be hailed, there- 
fore, as the discoverer of the Doc- 
trine of Emotional Equivalency, 



Most Common Harmonic, now 
shown to have been totally mis- 
taken, led to the T85 discoveries. 

The Hrrshtk notes, however, 
found long afterward, provide the 
real answer. 

Among a pile of sketches and 
musical fragments was found a 
long list — or, rather, a series of 
lists. In the form of a Galactic Dic- 
tionary, the paper is divided into 
many columns, each headed with 
the name of a different planet. 

Rather than describe this docu- 
ment, we are printing an excerpt 
from it herewith: 

FOMALHAUT II SIRIUS VII 
Sadness Madness 

Prayer Love 

Full Joy 

Golk NPE 

later promulgated in a different 
form by Space Patrol Psychiatrist 
Rodney Garman. Further, the doc- 
ument alluded to above explains a 
phrase in Hrrshtk’s noted letter to 
Dibble Young, which has puzzled 
commentators since its first ap- 
pearance. 

Hrrshtk is here alluding to the 
composition of his Revolutionary 
Ode, which all Terra knows as the 
most perfect expression of true love 
to be found in music : 

“If s a Revolutionary Ode to me, 
my friend — but not to you. As we 
say here, one man’s mood is another 
man’s passion.”

SEPTEMBER 1 : On this date in 
the year 9909, Treth Schmaltar 
died on his home planet of Welling- 
ton V. All the Galaxy knows his 
famous Symphonic Storm Suite; 
less known, but equally interesting, 
is the history and development of 
its solo instrument. 

The natives of Wellington V 
feed on airborne plankton, which 
is carried by the vibrations of 
sound or speech. This was a little- 
known fact for many years, but did 
account for the joy with which the 
first explorers on Wellington V 
were greeted. Their speech created 
waves that fed the natives. 

When eating, the natives emit a 
strange humming noise, due to the 
action of the peculiar glottis. These 
facts drove the first settlers, like 
Treth Schmaltar, to the invention 
of a new instrument. 




This was a large drumlike con- 
struction with a small hole in its 
side through which airborne plank- 
ton could enter. Inside the drum, 
a Wellingtonian crouched. When 

GALACTICK ALMANACK 



the drum was beaten, the air vibra- 
tions drove plankton into the na- 
tive’s mouth, and he ate and 
hummed. 

(A mechanical device has since 
replaced the native. This is, of 
course, due to the terrific expense 
of importing both natives and 
plankton to other planets than 
Wellington V for concerts.) 

Thus, a peculiarity of native life 
led not only to the Symphonic 
Storm Suite, but to such lovely 
compositions as Schmaltar’s Hum- 
Drum Sonata. 

SEPTEMBER 30: The victimi- 
zation of the swanlike inhabitants 
of Harsh XII, perhaps the most 
pitiful musical scandal of the ages, 
was begun by Ferd Pill, born on 
this date in 8181. Pill, who died 
penitent in a neuterary of the Bene- 
dictine Order, is said to have con- 
ceived his idea after perusing some 
early Terran legends about the 
swan. 

He never represented himself 
as the composer, but always as the 
agent or representative of a Harsh 
XII inhabitant. In the short space 
of three years, he sold over two 
hundred songs, none of great length 
but all, as musicians agree to this 
day, of a startling and almost un- 
Hnau-like beauty. 

When a clerk in the records de- 
partment of Pill’s publishers dis- 
covered that Pill, having listed him- 
self as the heir of each of the Harsh 

135 



XII composers, was in fact collect- 
ing their money, an investigation 
beg^n. 




That the composers were in fact 
dead was easily discovered. That 
Pill was their murderer was the 
next matter that came to light. 

In an agony of self-abasement, 
Pill confessed his crime. “The 
Harshians don’t sing at all,” he said. 
“They don’t make a sound. But — 
like the legendary swan of old Ter- 
ra — they do deliver themselves of 
one song in dying. I murdered them 
in order to record these songs, and 
then sold the recordings.” 

Pill’s subsequent escape from the 
prison in which he was confined, 
and his trip to the sanctuary of the 
neuterary, were said to have been 
arranged by the grateful widow of 
one of the murdered Harshians, 
who had been enabled by her 
mate’s death to remarry with a 
younger and handsomer Harshian. 

DECEMBER 5 : Today marks the 
birthday of Timmis Calk, a science 
teacher of Lavoris II. 



Calk is almost forgotten today, 
but his magnificent Student Or- 
chestra created a storm both of ap- 
proval and protest when it was 
first seen in 9734. Critics on both 
sides of what rapidly became 
a Galaxywide controversy were 
forced, however, to acknowledge 
the magnificent playing of the Stu- 
dent Orchestra and its great tech- 
nical attainments. 

Its story begins with Calk him- 
self and his sweetheart, a lovely 
being named Silla. 

Though Calk’s love for Silla was 
true and profound, Silla did not 
return his affectionate feelings. She 
was an anti-scientist, a musician. 
The sects were split on Lavoris II 
to such an extent that marriage be- 
tween Calk and his beloved would 
have meant crossing the class lines 
— something which Silla, a music- 
lover, was unwilling to contemplate. 

Calk therefore determined to 
prove to her that a scientist could 
be just as artistic as any musician. 
Months of hard work followed, un- 
til finally he was ready. 

He engaged the great Drick Hall 
for his first concert — and the pro- 
gram consisted entirely of classi- 
cal works of great difficulty. Bee- 
thoven’s Ninth Symphony opened 
the program, and Fenk’s Reversed 
Ode closed it. Calk had no time 
for the plaudits of critics and au- 
dience; he went searching for Silla. 

But he was too late. She had 
heard his concert — and had imme- 



136 



GALAXY 




diately accepted the marriage pro- 
posal of a childhood sweetheart. 

Calk nearly committed suicide. 
But at the last moment, he tossed 
the spraying-bottle away and went 
back to Silla. 



“Why?” he said. ‘Why did you 
reject me, after hearing the mar- 
velous music which I created?” 
“You are not a musician, but a 
scientist,” Silla said. “Any musician 
would have refrained from growing 
his orchestra from seeds.” 

Unable to understand her es- 
thetic revulsion. Calk determined 
there and then to continue his work 
with the Student Orchestra (it 
made a great deal more money 
than science-teaching). Wrapping 
his rootlets around his branches, he 
rolled away from her with crackling 
dignity.

/~VNE of the most exciting books

a first novel, this story contains all 
the necessary elements — taut and 
cumulative suspense, mystery, in- 
trigue, a gripping chase. 

The action occurs in the hours 
from 11 P.M. to 5 a.m. as the pro- 
tagonist lies helpless on an inter- 
rogation slab of the Population

Underground drugs. A brutal PCC 
captain, with personal axe to grind. 



uses counter-drug and electro- 
shock in the hope of restoring mem- 
ory by 5 A.M., rendezvous hour of 
the Underground. 

Similar to 1984 in background, 
benevolence is the keynote and 
Malthusian - principled population 
control coupled with controlled 
famine are the crutches of the dic- 
tatorship. The story is told in a 
series of flashbacks as the shock 
treatment restores bits of memory. 
The method is effective as a plot 
device and the reader should find 
it almost impossible, as I did, to 
stop reading merely for the sake 
of eating.

YEAR 2018! by James Blish. 
EARTHMAN COME HOME by 
James Blish. Avon Publications, 
Inc., N. Y., 35c each 

T NDEPENDENT both in plot 
character, these stories never- 
theless were intended as a two- 
part saga_ of Man’s path to the 
stars. In Year 2018! both West 
and East, steeped in bureaucracy 
and ultra-security, make research 
and information exchange almost 
impossible. A Machiavellian sena- 
tor from Alaska becomes a future- 
day Moses who leads Man to the 
stars but may not cross the gulf 
himself. 

This dim picture of the next few 
decades was valid just a couple of 
years ago, but Blish never dreamed 
of satellites so soon. Who did? 

Discovery of longevity drugs and 
anti-gravity allows entire cities to 
abandon Earth for greener pastures 
in Earthman Come Home, the 
more familiar story of the “Okies,” 
flying cities of itinerant laborers. 

Blish’s devious plot twists are 
reminiscent of the Asimov “Foun- 
dation” saga in which the shortest 
distance between two purposes is 
an indirect line. You’ll enjoy match- 
ing wits with the mayor of Man- 
hattan and his inverted approach 
to the hearts of problems.

Theodore Sturgeon. Doubleday

f F a Sturgeon collection is al- 
ways a ding-dong event, the 
present volume constitutes an en- 
tire carillon. 

In “A Crime for Llewellyn,” 
“The Girl Had Guts” and “It Opens 
the Sky,” he successfully pulls off 
story types new to his talents. “The 
Pod in the Barrier,” “The Touch of 
Your Hand,” “Mr. Costello, Hero” 
and “The Other Celia” must be im- 
modestly termed masterful psycho- 
logical studies, for they all appeared 
here. 

Strenuously recommended. 

DANGER IN THE AIR by Oliver 
Stewart. Philosophical Library,

^ LIVER STEWART, WWI 
ace, British government test 
pilot, commentator at the famous

ceptionally qualified to assess avia- 
tion accidents. His expert study of 
the causes of aircraft disasters 
from the earliest days of unpow- 
ered gliders to the Comet j6t-liner 
tragedies is particularly effective 
just now. The history of fifty years 
of aviation is eloquently written in 
this account of its errors and acci- 
dents. 

Unfortunately, the infinitely 
greater demands on men and ma- 
chines in the coming space age al- 
most guarantee publication of a 
similar sad but proud volume soon 
after 2000 a.d.

is indicated. Cognizant of this fact 
of life, the editors of Encyclopedia 
Americana have incorporated ar- 
ticles crammed with the latest in- 
formation on a galaxy of scientific 
topics. Additionally, of a total of 
some 26,000 pages, over 22,000 
have been completely rewritten or 
revised within the past four years 
with particular attention to the 
word level suiting the special needs 
of junior and senior high school 
students. 

The list of contributors is truly 
monumental : Wernher von Braun, 
Gen. Otis Benson, George Gamow, 
S. Fred Singer, Alexander de 
Seversky, etc., etc.

SF, THE YEAR’S GREATEST 
SCIENCE-FICTION AND FAN- 
TASY, edited by Judith Merril. 
Gnome Press, N.Y., $3.50 

T STATED, in my commentary 
on Clifton Fadiman’s fine Fan- 
tasia Mathematica, that an an- 
thology can be greater than the sum 
of its parts. Miss Merril’s third 
annual collection proves that the 
reverse is likewise true. 

The real trouble is that her liter- 
ary tastebuds are too few, too far 
apart, and too overdeveloped, so 
that sharing an anthologized meal 
with her causes gagging, about half- 
way through, to those who don’t 
share her affliction. She serves very 
much too much of what she likes, 
and everything else is spinach. 

This is a disservice to the in- 
dividual items on the menu. Many 
of them are good — though certainly 
not greatest — but they are all 
dessert. 

Using a large section of the book 
for Sputnik articles is surely one of 
the great editorial blunders of our 
time. 

THE YEAR WHEN STAR- 
DUST FELL by Raymond F. 
Jones. John C. Winston Co., Phila., 
$2.00 



^rmS latest addition to Win- 
-*■ ston’s admirable juvenile SF 
library is also one of the best to 
date. A facile writer, Jones also is 
a credible plotter. 

For story development, he ac- 
complishes the breakdown of civili- 
zation by having Earth capture col- 
loidal particles from a passing 
comet that have such affinity for 
metals that all machine parts weld 
to each other. The ensuing contest 
pits ignorance vs. knowledge, good 
vs. evil, with the ultimate survival 
of mankind as table stakes. 

The characters are drawn in 
black and white, but primal con- 
flict does remove most shades ex- 
cept blood-red. 

STAR GATE by Andre Norton. 
Harcourt, Brace & Co., N.Y., $3.00 

lyi ISS NORTON is justly fa- 
mous for her juvenile fiction, 
which has — at its best — few peers 
but no betters. Her present effort 
is not her best. It runs heavily to 
action, an ingredient always in plen- 
tiful supply in her works, but here 
preventing a full development of an 
alien picture. 

The “Star Lords,” presumably 
Earthmen who have bollixed up 
the lives of Gorth’s inhabitants, 
finally leave after hundreds of 
years. Spaceships long gone, they 
resort to dimensional travel via the 
“Star Gate,” winding up on an al- 
ternate Gorth where their counter-

parts have made an even greater 
mess of the planet. 

In leaving too much to imagina- 
tion, Miss Norton has made iden- 
tification next to impossible for the 
youngsters. 

THE ROCKET PIONEERS ON 
THE ROAD TO SPACE by Beryl 
Williams and Samuel Epstein. Ju- 
lian Messner, Inc., N.Y., $3.75 

EW scientific pathfinders find 
easy acceptance of their the- 
ories or inventions; none have had 
rockier rows to hoe than the pio- 
neer rocketeers. 

For centuries, rockets were either 
toys or wildly inaccurate artillery. 
Sir William Congrave greatly im- 
proved range and accuracy, but for 
a century longer, almost no experi- 
mentation was done despite Verne 
and his immense impact on public 
interest. 

Ziolkovsky, Russian; Oberth, 
German; Goddard, American, were 
the architects who made the V-2, 



Sputnik, Vanguard and Explorer 
possible. This is the fascinating 
story of these men and those who 
followed. 

Although our efforts have al- 
ready pierced deep space, most of 
the rocket pioneers are alive today!

L ike rifle fire, the vehement 
voices cracked through the 
quiet morning air. 

“Quid! Quid!” 

“It’s a quid!” 

“Lousy, filthy quid!” 

Wayne Conover’s hand whitened

on the tiller and he swung the car 
sharply toward the shoulder of the 
freeway. 

“Hey, Joe! We got us a quid!” 
“Let’s fix him up good!” 

“Grab the dirty louse!” 
High-pitched voices, the pierc- 



ing shrieks of children, counter- 
pointed by the deeper hayings of 
adolescent youths. 

Conover swallowed his fear. The 
epithets weren’t, after all, being 
hurled at him. He braked the car 
to a stop beside the weed-infested

tract and let the rush of inbound 
traffic hiss indifferently by. 

The lot was overflowing with 
kids. They came on in an 
angry, swelling tide. They crushed 
through the weeds and left eddies 
of dust and eager spores swirling in 
their wake. They wielded sticks 
and cast rocks and flung thick clods 
of mud. 

Before them, in panic, fled the 
quid. 

He was a middle-aged man, be- 
spattered and torn. Blood coursed 
down his cheek and there was the 
frenzied look of a flushed quarry on 
his face. 

He ran with a limp. Evidently it 
wouldn’t be the first time the ju- 
venile mob had overtaken him on 
this otherwise ironically calm 
morning. 

Helplessly, Conover stood on the 
side of the road, imable not to share 
the quid’s hopeless fright. Several 
times he started forward. But there 
was nothing he could do. 

A segment of the merciless 
avalanche of children broke away 
and circled wide to cut off the man’s 
escape. At the same time, another 
stream of screaming kids spilled 
into the lot from the outlying resi- 
dential subdivision. 

The quid went down suddenly, 
sprawling across a husky youth who 
had swerved in from a flanking po- 
sition to dive against his knees. 
Shrieking triumphantly, the horde 
closed in. 



^ ONOVER raced for the lot. Of 
^ course there was something he 
could do! He might at least present 
the pack with two targets and di- 
vert some of the attack! 

But suddenly there was a great 
fluttering of air about him and the 
piercing wail of a siren sounded 
overhead. He watched children 
scatter in all directions, like the 
weeds that were bending before 
the downdraft from the descending 
copter’s blades. 

The police vehicle alighted be- 
side the quid and out ran several 
officers, who made a pretense of 
giving chase after the juveniles. 
They laughingly gestured their in- 
adequacy at the edge of the field 
and, as always, turned back empty- 
handed. 

Slowly the man rose, wiping the 
grime from his cheeks with a tat- 
tered sleeve. A half-hour earlier, he 
had no doubt been a neatly dressed, 
respected citizen, his identity as a 
quid successfully concealed. 

One of the officers came over to 
Conover. “You in on this quid 
hunt?” 

“No, I-” 

“Missed out on the fun, eh?” The 
cop nudged him in the ribs. “Better 
luck next time — if some damned 
quid sympathizer doesn’t turn in 
the complaint too soon.” 

Conover followed him back to 
the copter. 

A lieutenant had the quid by the 
arm. “You! Whafs your name?” 



146 



GALAXY 



Head bowed, the man answered 
in a soft, unsteady voice. 

“All right. Mister Holier Than 
Thou,” said the officer through his 
teeth, “we’re taking you in for dis- 
turbing the peace and inciting riot.” 

The quid said nothing. One of the 
patrolmen shoved him roughly for- 
ward and sent him sprawling into 
the copter. 

Conover, his blond hair flaying 
his forehead in the downblast, 
watched the craft lunge skjrward. 
He set the quid’s name in his mem- 
ory and mentally counted the sav- 
ings he was bringing to town. 

The money was to have been 
used to furnish the nursery. He 
realized with some regret that giv- 
ing it up would make Alice unhap- 
py. But, for a normal person, she 
had almost a quid’s amount of sym- 
pathy. She would understand that 
the arrested man needed the cash 
much more desperately than they. 

T T was almost noon before Con- 
over, as terrestrial accommoda- 
tions consultant for the Far-Wide 
Travel Agency, finished with the 
line of prospective tourists who had 
queued up before his desk. He re- 
viewed the morning’s run of busi- 
ness: three Atlantic Depths cruises 
with stopovers at Bubble City; two 
North Polar Resort bookings; four 
for Everest Peak Lodge; two U.S. 
Riviera accommodations, and six 
for the Carlsbad Subterranean De- 
light Special at the ten-mile level. 

SOFT TOUCH 



It was a sizeable run. It had not 
been large enough, however, to em- 
barrass the efforts of the other five 
terrestrial and three celestial con- 
sultants. He gathered up the checks 
and bank notes and went over to 
deposit them with the cashier. 

On the way back, he was stopped 
by Ed Beaumont at the first ter- 
restrial desk. “Wasn’t that you I 
saw parked off the freeway this 
morning, Wayne?” 

Conover nodded uncertainly. 

“Watching the quid hunt, eh?” 
Beaumont was a bulky, dark man 
with a seemingly built-in chuckle. 
“They sure were giving him hell, 
weren’t they?” 

“It wasn’t pleasant,” Conover 
said. 

Beaumont’s brows came together 
dubiously. “I thought it was great 
fun.” Then, “Oh, you mean it wasn’t 
pleasant for the quid.” 

When Conover contributed noth- 
ing to Beaumont’s enjoyment, 
Beaumont stopped laughing. 

“The way you were standing 
there,” he went on, “it looked like 
you were itching to get in on the 
chase. But I never figured you for 
a quid hunter. Come to think of 
it, you always impressed me as a 
pretty placid guy.” 

While Beaumont considered the 
contradiction, Conover saw that 
their conversation might plant 
grave suspicions in the fun-lover’s 
mind. He started to turn away. 

“You weren’t really enjoying the 

147 



chase, were you, Wasme?” Beau- 
mont demanded, making it a chal- 
lenge. 

A simple falsehood would get 
Conover off the hook. A few well- 
chosen invectives, scornfully de- 
nouncing the quids, would prove he 
was a normal person. 

But Conover merely said, “I’ve 
got to straighten out some things 
on my desk.” It wasn’t a lie. 

With an amused, speculating 
look, Beaumont hunched forward. 
“You’re always right there when 
office collections are taken up, 
aren’t you? And I’ve seen you vol- 
unteer a dozen times to stay on 
after hours. You make good money, 
but you don’t live very well. I know 
— I’ve been out to your house.” 

Conover squirmed under the 
teasing but keen scrutiny. 

“There’s a client at my desk, Ed,” 
he said, thankful for the oppor- 
tunity to get away. He had no doubt 
now that Beaumont suspected. 

Beaumont rose, smiling. “I had 
a hell of a run of bad luck this week, 
chum. One of the kids got sick; the 
jalopy broke down; I missed a few 
payments here and there. Can you 
let me have about a hundred?” 

Conover reached for his wallet. 
But then he hesitated. He was fully 
aware that Beaumont was merely 
testing a suspicion, that compliance 
with the request, under the circum- 
stances, would only expose his 
identity as a quid. Yet Ed’s child 
had been sick. 



“You mean you’ve got it on 
you?” Eagerly, Beaumont watched 
Conover’s hand emerge with the 
wallet. “Actually,” he added, mak- 
ing his voice sound wistful, “a hun- 
dred and fifty would pull me out of 
all of my troubles.” 

Conover took the sum from the 
envelope marked “Baby Furni- 
ture.” 

“Really, Wayne, I don’t know 
when I’ll be able to pay this back.” 
“That’s all right.” 

Beaumont laughed. “Or even if 
I can square it at all.” 

“Forget it.” 

A LICE sat distressed on the liv- 
ing room couch that evening. 
She was a slight brunette, attrac- 
tive despite the worried expression 
that hounded her face. There was 
a neatness about her bearing which 
stood out in defiance of advanced 
pregnancy. 

She looked at last at her hus- 
band. “And you gave him the 
money?” 

Conover nodded miserably. “But 
I’ll make it up to you, honey. We’ll 
get everything the baby needs.” 
“That’s not the point, Wayne! 
Beaumont knows. There’s no tell- 
ing what’ll happen now!” 

He dropped down on the couch 
beside her. “I’m sorry, honey.” 
‘Why didn’t you, just for this one 
time, say no?” 

“I— well, maybe he really needed 
the money.” 



148 



GALAXY 



“More than us? Don’t you see he 
was just trying to find out if you’re 
a — if you’re different?” 

Dismally, Conover clasped his 
hands together. “He’ll do one of two 
things. Either he’ll let it out, or 
he’ll prove he’s a pretty human guy, 
after all, and keep it to himself.” 
“Or, more likely,” she suggested 
bitterly, “he’ll take advantage of 
you and bleed you for all he can 
get.” 

“I don’t think Eld’s that way. He 
was simply amused over meeting a 
quid. He just wanted to see if it 
was true — if we were as defense- 
less as they say. He’ll probably re- 
turn the money tomorrow.” 

“Oh, Wayne!” Alice let out a 
harassed sigh. “If there’s anything 
more frustrating than the fact that 
you always do what’s right, it’s the 
trust and faith you have in every- 
body. Can’t you ever suspect any- 
body of anything?” 

He rose and paced. “I knew I’d 
let you down,” he said in self-re- 
proach. 

Her face softened immediately. 
“I’m not angry, Wayne.” 

“Then disappointed.” 

“I knew what I was getting into. 
You told me what it would be like, 
being the wife of — of someone dif- 
ferent. I believed you, without 
reservation. I’m not sorry — not 
one bit.” 

She kissed him on the cheek. 
Still not reassured, he raised his 
hands uncertainly. “What do we do 



now? Rim again, the way we did 
two years ago?” 

“I doubt it.” She looked down at 
herself and laughed. “I won’t be 
in my best nmning condition for a 
few weeks yet.” 

It was her pregnancy that made 
things infinitely worse. He’d known 
other quids before, like himself. 
They all had a rough time trying 
to hide their identity. Whenever 
they were discovered, they had to 
flee like frightened animals. But 
he’d never known one with a child. 
And he wasn’t quite certain what 
to expect of the future. 

“Everything’s going to be all 
right, you big dope,” Alice prom- 
ised cheerfully, putting her arms 
about him. “And being married to 
you has its compensations — like 
never having to worry about an- 
other woman, and knowing that 
when you say I’m pretty, you mean 
it.” 

“But-” 

She placed her fingers lightly 
over his lips. “But nothing. I’m go- 
ing to fix supper. You try to forget 
about the whole thing.” 

He watched her disappear 
through the swinging door, wonder- 
ing whether he fully realized how 
wonderful she actually was. She 
was forgiving. She understood and 
accepted his mutant quirks. She 
was even resigned to his unreason- 
able irresponsibility with their 
money. Yet it wasn’t easy for her. 
Charity, truthfulness, honesty— they

were traits she had to acquire in a 
continuing struggle against basic 
human instinct. It was much more 
difficult than in the case of a quid, 
where those virtues were innate 
and irrevocable. 

f f YJ^ELL, son, you put your foot 
in it again, I see.” 

Alice’s father, shaking his almost 
bald head, stood in the doorway 
leaning on his stick. He was a rather 
tall man, lean and compact for his 
age. And the cane always impressed 
Conover as being more of a per- 
sonal affectation than an aid to 
walking. 

“You heard, Dad?” he asked, up- 
set. 

“Everything,” the old man shot 
back. “And I don’t aim to apolo- 
gize for eavesdropping.” 

“No, of course not. Not when it’s 
something that concerns all of us.” 
“Well, whafre you going to do?” 
Conover slumped dispiritedly. 
“Not much I can do, except wait 
and see what Beaumont decides.” 
Dad raised his cane menacingly. 
“I know how to take care of that 
scoundrel — wrap this thing around 
his neck and dare him to open his 
mouth. I’ll see him if you want me 
to.” 

“That wouldn’t do any good. If 
it’s not Beaumont this month, it’ll 
be somebody else next month. I’ve 
been here two years without being 
discovered. And that must be a 
record.” 



The old man was quiet for a 
tense while. Finally he said, “Alice 
isn’t playing it from the shoulder. 
She’s hiding a lot.” 

“Bills?” 

“Bills. Mounting expenses. She 
missed a couple of payments on the 
house. But what else would you ex- 
pect? You make good money, but 
not enough to throw it around 
like a free-wheeling philanthropist. 
Damn it, son, you got to think of 
your family!” 

“I try to. But I always seem to 
run into somebody who needs help. 
If only I weren’t such a soft touch.” 
“You don’t have to be. The word 
‘no’ is still in the dictionary.” 

Conover leaned back and thrust 
his hands in his pockets. Dad didn’t 
understand. Alice didn’t either. It 
wasn’t that they didn’t want to or 
didn’t try. God knew they were as 
sympathetic as any normal person 
could be. But nobody who wasn’t a 
mutant himself could appreciate 
the relentless compulsion to do 
good that drove a quid. 

Alice’s father cleared his throat. 
“Well, the immediate problem is 
that you gave half your savings to 
Beaumont, and the other half to 
some poor Joe who’s in the same 
shoes you’re likely to be in, in a 
few days. I can see you through 
part way with my pension check.” 
“You won’t have to. There’s the 
bonus.” 

. “Which won’t be in hand for an- 
other six months. Son, if you’d just

take a poke at someone once in a 
while, or haul off and cuss some- 
body out!” 

^ ONOVER realized then how 
^ helpless he felt and how much 
of a misfit he and all the others like 
him were. In an all-quid world, 
things might be different 

“What makes a quid. Dad?” he 
asked in misery. 

‘We’ve had them around all the 
time without knowing it. Some 
were called saints and burned at 
the stake. Others found their way 
into religious organizations. That 
gave them a sort of sanctuary. By 
renouncing worldly things, they re- 
assured all the frightened normal 
people that they weren’t in compe- 
tition with them.” 

“Frightened people?” 

“Of course. Other people are 
afraid of you. That’s why they hate 
you. That’s why they pass laws that 
you can’t gather in groups. That’s 
why they’re trying to fix it so you’ll 
have to register as quids and wear 
identification marks.” 

“They are afraid of us?” 

“People can’t tolerate others who 
look the same but are so different. 
They sense a threat to their way of 
life — a threat that’s even more dan- 
gerous because it’s hidden.” 

“But they make us hide!” 

“That figures. You’re also their 
conscience. You’re the spiritual per- 
fection they’ve been hypocritically 
talking about for thousands of 



years. You only serve to make 
them realize how far they are from 
spiritual perfection. People hate 
superior individuals.” 

When he went to bed that night, 
Conover lay awake a long while 
listening to Alice’s almost inaudible 
sobbing. He felt even worse when 
he realized she had held it in until 
she was certain he was asleep. 

Throughout the next day, 
though, Beaumont acted as though 
nothing out ' of the ordinary had 
happened. Twice he passed by 
Conover’s desk to discuss schedule 
changes. On neither occasion did 
he mention the money or even hint 
at the fact that Conover was a 
quid. 

Then, on his way out at closing 
time, he came around again. Smil- 
ing warmly, he laid several bills on 
the blotter. 

“There’s the one-fifty,” he said. 
“Decided I didn’t need it after all.” 

Absently watching the other per- 
sonnel file out of the office, Conover 
felt a gratifying sensation spread 
over him. That he was retrieving 
the money wasn’t in the least im- 
portant to him. What counted was 
that his faith in the man had been 
justified. 

"DEAUMONT came around the 
^ desk and cuffed his back. 
“And don’t worry about your se- 
cret. It’s safe.” 

“I — I don’t know what to say, 
Ed.” 



SOFT TOUCH

“Don’t have to say ans^hing. 
Come on out and have a drink and 
— Hey, Bob!” he paused to shout at 
Snyder, the cashier, who was just 
going out the door. “I haven’t 
checked in my receipts yet. Neither 
has Conover.” 

“I’m in a hurry,” the man called 
back. “You’re chief consultant. You 
have access to the safe, so do it 
yourself. But leave the slips on my 
desk.” 

Beaumont held Conover’s de- 
posit box open while Conover filled 
out his entry slip and placed the 
cash and credits within. By now 
the office was otherwise empty. 

At the first terrestrial desk, Beau- 
mont hastily made entries on his 
own slip, wedged his deposit box 
imder his arm and led Conover into 
the cashier’s cage. He dialed open 
the safe, placed his cash container 
in with the others and laid Cono- 
ver’s beside it. Then he paused to 
complete his entries. 

“I forgot the Barstow credit cer- 
tificates,” he said. “Get them for me 
while I finish this paper work, will 
you? They’re in my top drawer.” 

Conover couldn’t find them 
there, however. He called back in- 
formation to that effect and was 
told to try the side drawers on the 
right and, when they weren’t there 
either, the ones on the left. 

“Sorry, Wayne!” Beaumont fi- 
nally called out apologetically. 
“They were in my pocket all the 
while!” 



When Conover went back into 
the cashier’s cage, Beaumont was 
making the last entry on his sheet. 
“Close the safe and give it a twist. 
Then we’ll be on our way.” 

“About that drink,” Conover be- 
gan. “The baby’s due any day now 
and . .” 

“. and you want to get home,” 
Beaumont completed sympathetic- 
ally. “I understand. Anyway, I 
didn’t stop to ask myself how a 
quid might feel about taking a 
drink. See you tomorrow then.” 

In front of the building Conover, 
still warmed by a gratifying glow 
over Beaumont’s understanding 
and generosity, stared after him 
until he was swallowed up by the 
sidewalk crowd. 

Then ■ Conover watched the 
street lights flash on, buttoned his 
overcoat and started for the park- 
ing lot at the end of the block. 

“Just a second, Conover. I want 
to talk with you.” 

He turned to see Bob Snyder 
coming out of the door and locking 
it behind him. If the cashier had 
been in the office after Beaumont 
and himself, Conover realized 
puzzledly, then he must have been 
hiding. But why? 

“I’m going to offer you a drink 
too,” Snyder said, drawing up be- 
side him. “But the difference is that 
I don’t expect to be refused.” 

The cashier was a meagerly built 
man who hardly came up to Cono- 
ver’s eye level. His face was intense.

‘So you’re a quid,” he said 
evenly. “That explains everything.” 

^ I ■’ HEY hadn’t spoken since Sny- 
der had ordered a double scotch 
and Conover a glass of port. 

The cashier took a long draught, 
set his glass down heavily on the 
bar and said, “You’re not only a 
quid — you’re also a prize dupe.” 

“Why did you come back in the 
office after pretending to leave?” 
asked Conover in bewiderment. 

“Beaumont,” Snyder began ca- 
sually, “is usually the last to come 
in every morning, so I was curious 
when he was the second one in 
today. He didn’t know I was al- 
ready there, of course. I was even 
more curious when I saw him hide 
something that looked like a flash- 
light in his desk. Know what it 
was?” 

Conover silently shook his head. 

“A capacitance echo neutralizer,” 
Snyder told him. “It’s a device 
that’s popular among the criminal 
element. Whenever anybody gets 
near a metal object, like a safe, he 
leaves an echo of his individual 
capacitance impressed on its outer 
molecular structure. These impres- 
sions fade away in time. But as 
long as they’re there, they tell which 
persons, in what order, were in the 
vicinity.” 

“It doesn’t make sense,” Cono- 
ver objected. 

“To you, it wouldn’t. A quid, by 
nature, isn’t suspicious. Anyway, 



when Beaumont sent you to get the 
Barstow certificates, he emptied all 
the deposit boxes into his pockets, 
wiped his fingerprints off every- 
thing and used the electronic gad- 
get to neutralize his capacitance 
echo on the metal. Since you closed 
the safe, you’re the only one who’ll 
be implicated when the money is 
missing. Beaumont will probably 
say you watched him open the safe, 
memorized the combination, found 
some excuse to stay in the office 
after he left, and took the money 
then.” 

Conover gripped the stem of his 
wine glass. Beaumont’s trickery 
came as a sobering revelation. He 
wondered just how desperately in 
need of money the man was. 

“We’ll go find him,” he said ur- 
gently. “We’ll get him to put every- 
thing back.” 

“Turn the other cheek, eh?” 
Snyder snorted. “You quids are un- 
mitigated suckers.” 

“What are you going to do — 
turn him in?” Conover was think- 
ing of Beaumont’s wife and chil- 
dren. 

Snyder finished his drink and 
thoughtfully repeated the question. 
“Am I going to turn him in? Let 
me ask one first: Would a quid 
really cover up for Beaumont? 
Would he accept guilt?” 

HERE seemed to be a hungry 
eagerness about the man’s ex- 
pression, a savage look. 



154 



GALAXY 



“He wouldn’t want to see any- 
body suffer — not even Beaumont,” 
Conover offered frankly. “He would 
probably let it appear that he was a 
guilty person trying to establish his 
innocence. That would be one way 
of keeping his identity hidden and 
protecting his family. They’d suf- 
fer, you see, if it became known he 
was a quid.” 

Snyder smiled. “That’s probably 
just the way Beaumont figured it. 
And he knows enough about quids 
to realize he was on safe ground.” 

Conover studied the other man’s 
expression. It was a twisted smile, 
as though he were telling a joke 
and nearing the punch line. 

“We’re going to help Beaumont 
out of this jam, aren’t we?” Conover 
asked. 

Snyder tossed down the rest of 
his drink. “Of course not.” 

“Why not?” 

“Because I’m sitting pretty. He 
took a real haul out of that safe. 
Cash. Negotiable credits. And I’m 
the only one who could louse it up 
for him. He’ll kick in every last 
cent - and more — to keep from 
serving a prison sentence.” 

The stem of the glass snapped in 
Conover’s hand. But his stare re- 
mained rigid. “Why are you telling 
me this? You could have black- 
mailed him after I was arrested — 
without me even knowing about 
it.” 

The hungry, impatient look 
clung to Snyder’s face. Conover 



had no idea what it signified. 

“Why?” Snyder repeated, taking 
him by the arm and sliding off the 
stool. “Come on. I’ll show you.” 

He led him through a side door 
behind the bar and out into the 
alley. In the dim light that stabbed 
in from the street, the cashier’s 
face was even tenser than it had 
been at the bar. 

Conover had seen that expres- 
sion once before — on the face of a 
mentally deficient child who was 
amusing himself by tormenting a 
litter of day-old puppies and watch- 
ing them squirm in agony. 

He brought up his arms to ward 
off the blows he suddenly saw 
aimed at him, but he didn’t expect 
the kick in the groin. 

C ONOVER was late getting 
home that evening. With one 
eye half closed, he had to drive 
slowly. Then, too, he pulled off the 
freeway several times and used his 
handkerchief to stop the flow of 
blood from his cut lip. 

He tried to think of some way to 
avoid Alice and her father. But 
they were in the living room wait- 
ing for him. 

Wavering in the doorway, he 
heard Dad’s muffled oath and his 
wife’s sharply drawn breath as they 
stared incredulously at his bruised 
and lacerated face and his torn 
clothes. 

Alice hurried over and helped 
him into a chair. 



SOFT TOUCH 



155 



“What happened?” her father 
demanded. “Was it Beaumont?” 

“No.” 

“Don’t stand there, Dad,” Alice 
pleaded. “Get a towel and some hot 
water.” 

She didn’t say anything until he 
returned. Then, as she pressed the 
cloth against her husband’s cheek, 
she asked with restrained terror, 
“Did someone else find out, 
Wayne?” 

“Weren’t in a quid hunt, were 
you?” the old man persisted. 

“No. I’d rather not talk about it.” 

“Leave him alone. Dad,” Alice 
said. “He’ll tell us if he wants to.” 

“Don’t have to tell,” Dad grunt- 
ed. “I can imagine what happened. 
Somebody else found out what he 
is. Probably some little pipsqueak 
of a character who couldn’t hold 
up his end of a tiddly-winks 
match. Somebody tired of playing 
the role of spineless underdog and 
deciding to assert his masculinity 
for once in his miserable life. I just 
wish to hell I’d been there!” 

“Is that what happened, darl- 
ing?” she asked. 

Conover nodded. 

“Who was it?” Dad said. 

“Let’s not talk about it now. I’m 
tired.” 

“Of course you are,” said Alice, 
putting his arm around her shoulder 
and helping him toward the bed- 
room. 

Conover felt thoroughly miser- 
able. He wanted to tell her about 



his other difficulties — about the 
safe burglary and all that had hap- 
pened since then. But what end 
would it serve? Certainly neither 
she nor Dad could help. And he 
might at least give them another 
day or two of peace and security 
before the ceiling fell in. 

When Alice returned to the bed- 
room hours later, however, she 
avoided his gaze while she changed 
into her nightgown and got into the 
other bed. She turned her face 
toward the wall. 

“I’m leaving you, Wayne,” she 
said at last. 

He only continued staring at the 
ceiling. 

“If you could think harshly of 
anyone, you’d probably think I was 
selfish, picking this time to break 
away,” she went on. “But if I can 
walk out now — while you’re in 
trouble — then I know I’ll be able 
to stay away for good.” 

Actually, he realized, it was the 
only solution. There was but one 
way out of paying for Beaumont’s 
crime, and that was to let himself 
be exposed as a quid. He couldn’t 
expect Alice to share either stigma. 

“Wayne?” Despite her obvious 
uneasiness over his continued si- 
lence, she still avoided looking his 
way. “You know why I’m leaving, 
don’t you? It isn’t because I can’t 
take it. It isn’t that I don’t love you. 
And I’m not running out because 
you’re in trouble.” 

“It’s for the baby,” he said, 

GALAXY 



156 



“That’s right. You’re the nicest 
guy and best husband who ever 
lived. But you’re a luxury the baby 
can’t afford. Both of us realize our 
child deserves more out of life 
than being the son of — of someone 
different.” 

S INCE it mattered little now, Co- 
nover went to work two hours 
late the next morning. As he had 
expected, there were two police 
copters on the roof of the building 
and an official car in front. 

He had almost reached his desk 
before the plainclothesman over- 
took him. “You Conover?” 

Before answering, he glanced 
about the room. Beaumont was 
busy with a client Behind the ca- 
shier’s window, Snyder had his head 
bent low over the counter. 

“Yes, I’m Conover.” 

“Captain wants to see you in 
Mr. Markey’s office.” The plain- 
clothesman escorted him without 
relaxing the grip on his arm. 

In the private office, Markey 
looked up severely from his desk 
and fastened unwavering eyes on 
Conover. 

“That him?” asked a police of- 
ficer standing by the window. 

“Yes. But I’d like to talk with 
him alone for a minute. Captain.” 
The captain shrugged. “You’re 
president of the company. It’s your 
money.” 

Markey offered Conover a chair 
after the others had gone. “Wheth- 



er it’s necessary or not, Conover, 
I’ll fill you in. Fourteen thousand 
in cash and credits turned up miss- 
ing from the safe this morning. The 
police capacitance echo scanner 
showed Snyder opened the safe at 
eight-oh-five. That was when he 
discovered the money was gone. 
The only other capacitance trace 
the scanner picked up was yours 
— deposited at approximately six- 
twenty last night. The police also 
found your fingerprints on the safe. 
What do you have to say?” 

Conover bowed his head. “Noth- 
ing.” 

Markey impatiently drummed 
the desk with stout fingers. “You’re 
a quid, aren’t you?” 

Conover glanced up abruptly. 
“Who told you? Beaumont? Sny- 
der?” 

The president smiled. “All right. 
Captain,” he called out, “you can 
come in now.” 

The officer entered, followed by 
several other men. 

“Just as you figured ” Markey 
explained, “he’s a quid. Two men 
in this office know it — Beaumont 
and Snyder. I’d say that just about 
takes care of the inconsistencies.” 

The officer and plainclothesmen 
and another man who was jotting 
down notes on a pad stared with 
naked dislike at Conover. 

“You want to lodge any charge 
against him?” The captain thrust 
an eager thumb toward Conover. 

“No,” Markey said firmly. “I’m

157 



no quid hater. Now I’d appreciate 
the privacy of my office again. Con- 
over, you stay here.” 

The others filed out and Cono- 
ver asked, “What inconsistencies?” 
“The police thought it looked 
like a frameup. Beaumont or Sny- 
der, whoever it was, apparently in- 
tended to erase only his own pre- 
vious echo from the safe. But he 
used so much juice that he left the 
metal virgin pure. Your echo 
leaped out so clearly that you were 



the last one we could suspect.” 
“How did you know I was a 
quid?” 

“Only a quid would be naive 
enough to let himself be played for 
a sucker like that.” 

Markey had been smiling ami- 
ably for several seconds. But sud- 
denly his expression became quite 
serious. 

“Like I told the captain,” he 
continued hesitantly, “I’m no quid 
hater. I believe in live and let live.

If there are people who can’t do 
any wrong and insist on making 
things easier for the rest of us, I 
don’t mind that either.” 

He came around the desk and 
laid his hand on Conover’s shoul- 
der. “But I’m a practical business- 
man, Wayne. I’ll have to let you go. 
Having a quid around wouldn’t 
help business any.” 

“But nobody else has to know!” 
Conover said hopelessly. 

“You’re wrong. You saw the re- 



porter who was here. The whole 
story is probably already on the 
newscasts. I wanted to keep him 
out. But you know how those 
things go — whenever somebody 
tries to sit down on this kind of 
news, the first shout that goes up 
is ‘quid lover!’ ” 

Conover started for the door. 

“I’m sorry, Wayne,” Markey 
said. 

And Conover knew he sincerely 
was. 




SOFT TOUCH

TT E stopped the car more than 
a block away from his home 
and sat there appalled at the harsh 
reality of the scene. 

There were scores of persons — 
many of them neighbors and 
friends — milling around on the 
front lawn, like explosive charges 
waiting for an insignificant spark 
to set them off. 

Someone had festooned the cus- 
tomary banner from pole to pole 
across the walkway. The words 
were vivid and cruel: 

A QUID LIVES HERE! 

He watched two men, each car- 
rying a pail, break loose from the 
crowd and dart up the steps. They 
swung the buckets and splashed 
steaming tar across the white sid- 
ing of the house. Dipping sticks 
into the viscous liquid, they scrib- 
bled filthy words on the weather- 
boards. Then they had to retreat 
from a hail of stones that went 
crashing through the glass door and 
windows. 

Conover held the tiller in an an- 
guished grip. Alice! God, if she was 
in that mess! 

He sent the car spurting forward, 
but slammed on the brakes again 
as he saw his father-in-law coming 
from behind a hedge in front of the 
next house. His sweater was torn 
and stretched grotesquely out of 
shape and his chin was bruised. A 
broken cane, the upper half of 



which he still gripped tenaciously, 
showed he had not been the only 
one to get hurt. 

He got in the car. “Well, son, 
you damned well maneuvered us 
into it good this time.” 

“Where’s Alice?” Conover asked, 
afraid of the answer he might get. 

“She’s all right. Packed a grip 
and left an hour before the news- 
casts came out.” 

Conover sent the car rolling 
slowly forward and turned at the 
first intersection. “What can I do, 
Dad?” 

“Don’t know as how there’s 
very much you can do. Nature just 
made a mistake with people like 
you. This isn’t the first time she 
turned out a batch of useless, lethal 
mutations. It’s her idea of a joke, 
I guess.” 

“I don’t suppose there’s any use 
asking where Alice is.” 

Dad leaned back against the 
cushion and exhaled audibly. “No, 
there isn’t. She made me give my 
word.” 

Conover swallowed. 

“But they tell me St. James In- 
firmary,” the old man added casu- 
ally, “is a pretty good place for a 
woman to have a baby.” 

^ I ^ HEY waited while the floor 
nurse ran a finger down the 
roster of patients. But she paused 
and glanced up troubledly. 

“Alice Conover?” she said, frown- 
ing. “Conover — Conover — Wayne 



160 



GALAXY 



Conover! You’re that quid!” 

“Hurry it up, sister,” Dad said 
irately. “We want to see her.” 

The nurse’s features grew set and 
hard. “Visiting hours are 'at seven. 
But don’t bother coming back. She 
won’t be able to see anybody.” 

An orderly who had overheard 
stepped forward. “If this quid is 
giving you any trouble. Miss Da- 
vis,” he volunteered, “I’ll let him 
have it.” 

“No, Mr. Johnson. We don’t 
want any riot in here. He’ll leave.” 
“Alice—” Conover pleaded— “has 
she had the baby yet?” 

Dad lunged to the desk and 
grabbed for the roster. But Johnson 
seized his wrist, jerking him away. 

“Oh, Dr. Dorfmann.” Relieved, 
the nurse glanced down the hall at 
a white-smocked man who was just 
coming out of the nursery. “Please, 
Doctor. Over here.” 

The elderly physician, grinning 
genially, came over. His presence 
seemed to cast a spell that instantly 
restored the composure of the nurse 
and orderly. Harsh lines of anger 
and hate vanished from their faces 
and were replaced by fond smiles. 

Dad too, Conover noticed 
puzzledly, was visibly moved by 
the man’s overwhelming personal- 
ity, and was staring at him with 
fascination and intense respect. 

“Yes, Nurse?” Dorfmann in- 
quired. 

She seemed lost in an outpouring 
of inarticulate affection. Her sub- 



missive expression of gratitude and 
respect was like a soft light on her 
face. 

Conover drew back, bewildered 
over the strangeness of the scene. 

“Oh.” Miss Davis abruptly 
found herself. “This is Mrs. Cono- 
ver’s husband. He’s that — quid.” 
Dorfmann laughed lightly. “Now 
is that so important?” 

“I told him he couldn’t see her.” 
“But of course he may. However, 
I think he should meet his son first. 
Have you seen the baby. Miss Da- 
vis? We just finished cleaning him 
up.” 

She shifted uncertainly. “I — no, 
I haven’t I’m so busy—” 

“I really think you ought to go 
take a look at the child,” the phy- 
sician insisted gently. 

She wavered, but only for a 
moment. He dazzled her with a 
smile and she went obediently 
down the hall. 

“You too, Johnson,” Dorfmann 
said to the orderly. 

Johnson trotted expectantly af- 
ter the nurse, as if told that a sur- 
prise awaited him. 

A FTER they had left, the doctor 
put his arm around Conover’s 
shoulder in a warmhearted gesture. 

Incredulously, Conover gaped at 
him. “But — but I’m a quid!” 

Dorfmann laughed until his eyes 
moistened. “So am I, son.” 

Some vast suspicion was begin- 
ning to suggest itself to Conover. 



SOFT TOUCH 



161 



He pushed it away. It was too im- 
possible to believe. 

“You can’t be! They like you — 
and everybody hates quids!” 

“Original mutants, perhaps,” 
Dorfmann readily agreed. “But not 
second-generation quids, like your 
son and me. There’s a difference, 
you know.” 

Miss Davis came eagerly out of 
the nursery. “Why, Doctor, he’s the 
loveliest baby we’ve ever had here! 
There’s something about him that 
simply—” 

She hesitated inadequately, as 
though struggling to find words that 
had never been needed until this 
moment 

She stopped trying and turned 
instead toward Conover. “I’m sure 
you’ll be awfully proud of him. If 
there’s anything we can do for you 
or Mrs. Conover, you just let us 
know.” 

The orderly returned to the hall. 
“Say, Doc, I’d sure like to bring my 
wife to see that baby. Will it be all 
right?” But before Dorfmann 
could answer, Johnson seized Con- 



over’s hand and pumped it vigor- 
ously. “Congratulations, Mr. Con- 
over. You’re sure lucky to have a 
kid like that.” 

The physician stopped smiling 
and nodded his head confidently 
after the orderly had started strid- 
ing up the corridor. “You may 
have had a rough time until now,” 
he told Conover. “But with that 
baby, you’ll do all right from here 
on out.” 

Johnson paused in the doorway 
to the nursery. “Don’t you two 
guys forget to vote for Dr. Dorf- 
mann in the next election.” 

“You running for something?” 
Dad asked the physician. 

“Congressman from the Sixth 
District. Maybe I’ll be able to do 
some real good there.” He added 
facetiously, “And I think I have 
a fair chance of being elected, don’t 
you?” 

Johnson stuck his head out the 
nursery for a final word. “Say, 
Conover, maybe your kid’ll run 
for President some day!”

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



T he tiny ship let herself 
down furtively, pretending 
not to be there. Since she 
was landing plumb in the middle 
of fifteen million square miles of 
uninhabitedness, she had every 
chance of getting away with the 
pretense. 

The pilot, George Kimber, 
looked for a lake, found one, and 
dropped toward it as if pulled by 
a cable. A couple of hundred yards 
from the edge, he landed neatly 
and looked around him curiously. 

He had once visited the friend- 
ly northern hemisphere of Vokis; 
it was hard to believe this forbid- 
ding landscape was part of the 
same planet. Three smoking vol- 
canoes were visible from where 
the ship lay. Half a mile away, a 
hot spring suddenly hissed and 
spouted. No grass, no trees, no 
vegetation of any kind brightened 
the sullen wasteland of solidified 
lava, dull red igneous rock and 

165 



sand that sulked under a metallic 
gray sky. 

Looking down, he saw his pas- 
senger emerge at the base of the 
ship, lugging two heavy cases. She 
was unusually shapeless in a white 
asbestos suit. He would have gone 
down to help her, but her instruc- 
tions had been quite definite — she 
was to set foot alone on the sur- 
face of Vokis, and she and the 
ship must be away fifteen minutes 
at most after landing. 

She made three rapid journeys, 
dragging very big black cases 
to a spur of rock only a hundred 
yards from the lake. The shape 
of this rock suited her purpose ex- 
cellently. A huge flat stone had 
fallen over on a smaller rock, form- 
ing a fair-sized cave closed at one 
end by hard-packed sand. Al- 
though it was only five feet high 
at its apex, the cave afforded a 
perfect cache. 

When she had packed the cases 
inside, she kicked sand into the 
entrance to seal the gap, but 
couldn’t fill it. She needn’t worry, 
Kimber thought— the stuff could 
stay there undiscovered for a 
thousand years. 

One small box she left out of 
the cache. She buried this in the 
sand right at the water’s edge, 
stamping the sand hard on top of 
it. Then she ran well away from 
it along the shore of the lake and 
stopped with her back to the box 
she had buried. 



Kimber leaned forward in ex- 
citement, knowing what was going 
to happen. No matter how often 
he saw this, he could never quite 
believe it. 

Suddenly the girl was in the 
water, precisely where she had 
buried the box. She didn’t walk 
there, run there or jump there. She 
just was there. And where she had 
stood an instant before, water 
splashed and soaked into the sand. 

Jumping out of the water and 
shaking herself, she ran toward the 
ship, waving to Kimber. She was 
satisfied. 

In another five minutes, the ship 
was out of Vokis’s atmosphere and 
heading back to Earth. 

TN the comparative void of 
space, another ship sped to- 
ward Vokis. But this was months 
later, and this ship was a hundred 
times larger, and she wasn’t pre- 
tending not to be there. 

She was the Vokian Queen, one 
of the regular Earth-Vokis liners. 

McKinlay hesitated before push- 
ing open the door of the cabin, a 
worried frown on his face. The 
trouble with complicated plans, no 
matter how brilliant, is that you al- 
most invariably need assistants to 
help you carry them out. And that 
means relying on others for the 
success of your plan, your liberty 
and even your life. 

McKinlay hated having to rely 
on anybody but himself. 



166

However, it was much too late 
to withdraw now. He pushed open 
the door and went inside. 

The girl in front of the mirror 
waved casually to him in the glass. 
His eyes widened incredulously as 
he saw her reflection. In two 
jumps, he was beside her, roughly 
jerking her shoulder to spin her 
round. 

“Oh, God!” he muttered savage- 
ly. “Why am I surrounded by 
fools?” 

The girl tore her shoulder free 
and turned back to the mirror. 
“They say you know a man by 
the company he keeps,” she said 
drily. 

“Suppose anybody saw you like 
that — don’t you know it would 
ruin ever3rthing?” 

Joan said nothing. She was 
studying the face in the mirror as 
if it were somebody else’s. As a 
matter of fact, it was — literally. 

She was a medium-sized blonde 
with a figure that was no more 
than passable, and her white 
sheath evening gown did nothing 
to make it look any better than it 
was. Her breasts were small and 
hard, her waist thickish and her 
hips too lean. 

Incensed almost to violence, 
McKinlay had to jam his hands 
in his pockets to prevent himself 
from wrapping them around her 
throat. 

“Are you out of your mind?” 
he demanded. “If anyone on board 



this ship saw you like that—” 

“I haven’t invited anybody to 
my cabin,” she said mildly. 

“Yes, but suppose somebody—” 

“Well, if anybody but you came 
in, I guess I could always jump 
up with a shriek and dive into the 
bathroom.” 

“All the same—” 

Joan sighed. “Genius, I’m going 
to tell you something for your 
own good. People aren’t as dumb 
as you think. I know I’m not as 
smart as you. Nobody is. Never- 
theless, when I do something, 
there’s quite often some vague, 
childish, half-formed idea behind 
it.” 

McKinlay calmed down. “Such 
as?” 

“Such as practice.” 

“Practice?” 

“I may sometimes have to be- 
come Opal in a hurry. And then 
become me again in nothing flat. 
So it seemed to me that even the 
frightful risk of somebody bursting 
into my cabin and seeing another 
woman there was worth taking 
to-” 

McKinlay grunted. “Let’s see 
you become Joan McKinlay in 
nothing flat.” 

“Okay,” Joan said amiably. 

Q HE stood up and threw off her 
clothes. Some women don’t 
show themselves in their skins 
for reasons of modesty. Others 
shouldn’t for reasons of common

sense. Joan was one of the latter. 

At least, at the moment, she 
was. 

She picked up the two elec- 
trodes of a small machine on the 
dressing table, put one foot on the 
seat and applied the electrodes 
above and below her calf. The 
muscle jumped in protest. With 
firm double strokes, she chased it 
where she wanted it to go. After 
a few seconds’ treatment, she put 
that leg down and her other leg 
up. The effect of her treatment 
was to move the swell of calf about 
two inches higher. Her thighs re- 
ceived a deft stroke or two, and 
too-hard muscles relaxed. 

When she stopped working on 
them, what had previously been 
merely a couple of passable femi- 
nine legs were in the showgirl 
class. 

The two electrodes touched her 
groin, extended the arc, curved in, 
and she had the taut abdominal 
muscular development of a belly- 
dancer. The hard muscles of her 
breasts were softened; her bosom 
became full though still firm, and 
when she laid down the electrodes, 
she had a figure in a million. 

She sat at the table again and 
began to model her face. The elec- 
trodes tightened her cheek mus- 
cles. An ointment which she 
handled very carefully with cot- 
ton held in forceps enabled her to 
give her small chin a slight cleft. 
The same ointment changed the 



shape of her ears and flattened 
them to her head. A quick eye 
rinse brightened her eyes and ap- 
peared to darken their blue color. 
Her nose shrank under the appli- 
cation of another ointment. She 
took caps off nine teeth, improv- 
ing them in the process. 

Having completed her trans- 
figuration, she moved immediate- 
ly to the washstand, washed her 
hands and face quickly, and 
swabbed and dried the areas of 
her body which had been touched 
by the damp electrodes. 

Again without pause, she turned 
to the bed and picked up another 
dress, also white, also an evening 
gown. But when she slipped it on 
and stepped into high-heeled san- 
dals, the fact that in both cases 
her hair was the same, her height 
and weight unchanged and her 
dress a white evening gown, only 
served to emphasize the other dif- 
ferences. 

“Well?” Joan asked. 

“Four minutes,” McKinlay said. 
“Same time the other way?” 

“A little longer. This is me. It’s 
easier to get back to being me 
than to duplicate Opal. Six min- 
utes the other way.” 

M cKINLAY nodded grudging- 
ly. “Pretty good,” he con- 
ceded. 

“How about it?” she asked. 
“Was I right to practice? Maybe 
in my half-baked, fumbling way. 



168 



GALAXY 



I had some excuse for taking such 
a fearful risk of ruining your mas- 
ter plan?” 

“Oh, sure.” 

“Thanks for the most gracious 
apology,” said Joan. 

“One thing, though. You’re not 
wearing anything under that 
dress.” 

“I know. If seconds count—” 
“Now look, Joan. C.O.S. is the 
cleverest, most efficient, most 
thorough police force in the 
Galaxy. One tiny mistake and 
they’re on it like hawks. Any 
really close observer could see 
you’re not wearing a thing under 
that dress.” 

“Any really close observer is 
meant to,” she retorted blandly. 
“Genius, I’ll have to tell you again. 
People aren’t as dumb as you 
think. I especially am not as dumb 
as you think.” 

“Are you telling me—” 

“Listen. On Vokis, I intend to 
wear clothes that would make 
Madame Pompadour look like a 
new girl at a convent. The only 
thing I’m going to wear under any- 
thing is skin. Don’t tell me you 
can’t figure out why.” 

“I can’t figure out why,” he said 
stiffly. “Seems to me the best thing 
is not to attract attention, instead 
of-” 

“Genius, let’s face it. Opal’s 
figure wouldn’t excite a sailor 
marooned for a year. The more I 
flash mine around, the more pre- 



posterous it’s going to seem that 
I could ever be taken for Opal, 
or vice versa.” 

McKinlay shrugged reluctantly. 
“Maybe you’ve got a point.” 
“You never spoil anybody with 
compliments, do you?” 

“Hell, I’ve admitted you could 
possibly be right. What more do 
you want?” 

“Nothing.” She looked at him 
with whimsical exasperation. “I 
see you’re going to play your part 
all right.” 

“Huh?” 

“Pretending to be my husband.” 
“What are you talking about?” 
“There’s no risk of anybody 
thinking you’re too attentive to me 
for me to be your wife.” 

“Hell, no. This is a business 
partnership.” 

“Obviously.” 

McKinlay frowned. “You told 
me you wanted it that way.” 

“Oh, yes. So I do. But when a 
girl surrenders her virtue and 
maidenly modesty in the interests 
of a business partnership, she’d 
still prefer the partner to be at 
least interested.” 

McKinlay grunted and dropped 
the unimportant subject. “Are you 
sure that transmitter you planted 
will still work? Did you set it up 
right?” 

“Do we have to go into that 
again?” 

“I just wondered if you were 
quite sure—” 



NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



169 



“Genius, pay attention while I 
repeat— people aren’t as dumb as 
you think. Especially, I’m telling 
you again, me.” 

McKinlay grunted again, un- 
convinced. 

O PAL Conway — Opal herself, 
not an imitation — looked 
exactly as Joan — made up to re- 
semble Opal — had looked in the 
sheath evening dress. She was at 
the window of a room high in an 
hotel in Vanna, one of the prin- 
cipal cities of the planet Vokis. 

“That’s the ship landing now,” 
she said. 

Behind her. Bill Conway dropped 
his glass. It didn’t break, of course; 
the bourbon soaked into the thick 
carpet. 

Opal turned impatiently. “For 
Pete’s sake, take a grip on your- 
self, Bill.” 

“I hop>e to God they’re not on it,” 
said Bill fervently. 

“Of course they’re on it. Think 
we’ve been planning for six months 
just to give up now?” 

“I wish I’d never listened to 
you.” 

Opal shrugged. “And I wish I’d 
never had to tell you anything 
about it. But you have to know. 
You may have to cover up for— 
for the other girl.” 

She knew the room wasn’t 
tapped. Nevertheless, it would 
have been lunacy to mention Joan 
and McKinlay by name. She knew 



how often people who are certain 
they aren’t being overheard do 
happen to be overheard. 

“Look, honey, we’ll never get 
away with this,” said Bill hope- 
lessly. “The Vokis police . the 
C.O.S. .” He shuddered. 

Opal didn’t bother to answer. 

Bill bit his nails nervously. He 
was a thin, harassed man, not yet 
thirty, but already very thin on 
top. Opal was hard and metallic, 
the kind of woman who seldom 
even pretended to care about any- 
thing beyond her own interests. 
She could make love to a man 
or shoot him with the same un- 
complicated efficiency. 

“Why did it have to be you?” 
Bill burst out. 

“You know very well why it 
had to be me.” 

“Yes. You’re a teleport. I 
wish—” 

With quick, angry strides. Opal 
was before him, and she slapped 
him stingingly on the cheek. 
“Didn’t I tell you never to men- 
tion that word?” 

“Sure, honey,” said Bill, cower- 
ing back. “I only—” 

“Get this straight. We can’t miss 
so long as the C.O.S. never get the 
slightest hint of how it’s done. Tele 
— people like — the other girl and 
me are rare as snowstorms on 
Mars. When we start to operate, 
it will certainly occur to somebody 
in the C.O.S. that a — that one of 
us might be mbced up in the affair. 



170 



GALAXY 



But never in their wildest dreams 
will anybody imagine there are 
two of us. And until they start 
working on that idea, they’ll never 
figure out how it could be done. 
So get this, sweetheart If you 
mention that word once more 
while we’re on Vokis, you’ll never 
get to say it twice.” 

“Sure, honey,” said Bill again. 

It would never be guessed that 
if Opal cared for anything or any- 
body apart from herself, it was 
Bill. But that was the case. 

'%7’ OKIS was easily the richest 
* world in the Galaxy. It was 
also one of the most pleasant to 
live on, with its mild winters, not 
too hot summers, and complete 
absence of native life, with its 
warm, calm seas and beautifully 
planned cities. 

How it came to be such a para- 
dise was largely because it was an 
unusually young world to be habit- 
able. Its internal heat was high 
and its sun was gentle and well- 
behaved. There had been time 
for the crust of Vokis to become 
hard and stable — except in the 
southern volcanic region, which 
was unlikely to be settled for 
many centuries yet — but not 
enough time for indigenous life 
to develop. So life came to it, as 
is the way of life. 

The humans who came to Vokis 
had learned a lot about coloniz- 
ing worlds by this time and didn’t 

NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



make the usual mistakes. Given a 
chance, for once, to set up their 
own ecology, they seized it grate- 
fully, and any errors they did 
make canceled each other out 
after a century or so. 

The result was a world without 
insects or birds — unless you 
counted imported chickens and 
ducks. A world without pests of 
any kind, for only herbivorous 
animals were brought to it, all 
large enough to be kept under 
control. A world where even the 
bacteria were controlled. 

All this would have amounted 
to nothing unless the mineral re- 
sources of Vokis made settlement 
worthwhile. However, the mineral 
resources of Vokis were more than 
adequate. Gold, silver, platinum 
and diamonds were so common 
that mere export of raw ore soon 
ceased to be economic. Vokis be- 
came the prime manufacturer of 
small precision goods. Watches, 
clocks, electronic components, 
tools, lenses, cameras, stone set- 
tings — anything which was small 
and light and expensive became 
virtually the monopoly of Vokis. 

Because Vokis was rich anyway, 
it wasn’t worth the effort of making 
and exporting anything but the 
best. And soon everybody every- 
where knew it. A Vokis label meant 
supreme quality. Vokis found her- 
self in the sublimely comfortable 
position of never quite being able 
to catch up with the demand 

171 



throughout the rest of the Galaxy 
for her products. 

Wealth attracts buzzards like 
carrion. Until nearly half a century 
ago, Vokis had been rich and law- 
less. But when Vokis began strictly 
controlling immigration and formed 
the Civil Order Service, the best 
paid, least corruptible and most 
astute police force in the Galaxy, 
law and order came to stay. And 
still more wealth migrated there to 
enjoy the protection of the C.O.S. 

Now Vokis was a legend. Every- 
body wanted to go there; few were 
admitted. Every crook wanted a 
share of the loot; none got any. 

But to do the criminal fraternity 
justice, there was always somebody 
ready to try. 

' ■''HE customs inspection was as 
exhaustive and exhausting as 
McKinlay had been led to expect. 
He was glad that he and Joan had 
made no attempt to sneak in the 
apparatus they needed. The only 
way to install it anywhere on the 
surface of Vokis was the way Joan 
had already done it. 

That was also, of course, the only 
way to get anything away. 

All Joan’s makeup equipment 
had been consigned to the Vokian 
Queen’s very efficient and carni- 
vorous disposal system. So McKin- 
lay was able to watch the exacting 
customs examination with the 
amused tolerance of one who wasn’t 
attempting to smuggle anything. 

172 



It was warm and sunny as he 
stepped out on the field. To the 
west lay the fabulous skyline of 
Vanna. To the south, the sea. To 
the east, five broad highways lead- 
ing to other major cities. To the 
north, a tall, good-looking man who 
was exhibiting keen and disturbing 
interest in Greg McKinlay. ' 

“Mr. McKinlay?” said the tall 
man pleasantly. “My name’s Glyn 
Morgan. Welcome to Vokis.” ' 

“I didn’t expect to be met,” said 
McKinlay, summoning surprise 
and pleasure to cloak his uneasiness 
at seeing so soon the dreaded Civil 
Order Service badge. “Glad to 
know you.” 

“I understand you’re here to do 
a book on the C.O.S.,” said Morgan 
affably. “Your publisher asked for 
cooperation, and naturally we’re 
glad to oblige. Isn’t your wife with 
you?” 

“That’s her coming down now,” 
said McKinlay. 

Morgan looked up and blew all 
his fuses. Joan had emerged wear- 
ing Bermuda shorts and a suntop 
which contained an astonishing 
amount of material considering it 
managed not to conceal anything. 
Watching the tall, handsome and 
very efficient-looking C.O.S. man '§ 
go to pieces at sight of Joan, Mc- 
Kinlay felt much better. He was 
only a man, after all. 

“Joan, meet Glyn Morgan of the 
C.O.S.,” he said. 

Joan walked straight-legged on 
GALAXY 



her high heels up to Morgan and 
took his hand. 

“To say this is going to be a 
pleasure,” Morgan croaked hoarse- 
ly, “would be to state only one per 
cent of the truth.” < 

Joan smiled. “Greg,” she said 
over her shoulder, “see about the 
divorce, will you?” 

“Mrs. McKinlay,” said Morgan 
earnestly, “don’t say things like that 
unless you mean them.” 

It looked as if Joan’s idea was 
correct, McKinlay had to admit. It 
would never cross Morgan’s mind 
that Joan could be mistaken for 
non-whistlebait like Opal Conway. 

ORGAN was most helpful. 

McKinlay had known very 
well that no ingenious, untrue story 
would get him into Vokis unsus- 
pected. He really had approached 
a reputable New York publisher 
with an outline and specimen chap- 
ters of a book on the C.O.S. of Vo- 
kis which had made the book edi- 
tor’s eyes glisten. 

This was not surprising, for 
McKinlay had paid a top-line 
crime writer a fat fee to produce 
the synopsis. 

Since McKinlay’s proposal was 
to go to Vokis with his wife at his 
own expense to collect the neces- 
sary first-hand material, the pub- 
lisher was perfectly willing to draw 
up a contract for the proposed book 
and make the approach to Vokis 
asking for cooperation. 

NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



Morgan took them on a quick 
helicar tour of the main landmarks 
of Vanna, giving them enough im- 
portant bearings so they wouldn’t 
ever get hopelessly lost. He showed 
them his own home and traced the 
route to the McKinlay’s hotel. He 
installed them in their suite and 
indicated his eagerness to tell or 
show McKinlay everything he 
wanted to know, either immedi- 
ately or at any time he might sug- 
gest. 

“That’s very kind of you, Mor- 
gan,” said McKinlay. His brain 
raced. Although he liked to work 
everything out to the last detail, 
it delighted him to be able to seize 
any opportunity of improving on 
an already excellent plan. “How 
about this evening — about eight, 
perhaps?” 

Joan looked up sharply. “But, 
Greg-” 

“Or maybe a little later,” said 
McKinlay quickly. “Eight-thirty?” 

“Sure,” said Morgan. “Nothing 
else you want now? Don’t hesitate 
to call on me for anything you want. 
That goes for you too, Mrs. 
McKinlay.” 

“And if there’s anything you 
can’t do for me,” said Joan art- 
lessly, “I can always ask your wife.” 

“My wife? I’m not married.” 

“Oh,” said Joan, as if that were a 
very important item of information. 

Morgan laughed somewhat 
breathlessly and left them. 

They knew better than to start 

173 



talking where they were. McKinlay 
suggested a stroll before lunch, and 
Joan made a few harmless remarks 
about what a nice man Mr. Morgan 
was. 

Only when they were out on a 
broad, handsome boulevard did 
Joan say: “As you once so politely 
asked me, are you out of your 
mind? This evening is the first job.” 

“Exactly,” said McKinlay with 
satisfaction. “Zero hour is 8.46. 
Morgan will arrive at exactly 8.30. 
We’ll give him a drink. You’ll be 
wearing one of your most sensa- 
tional outfits. It will play hell with 
Morgan’s concentration. I’ll see this 
after a while and tell you to go and 
put on something decent. At 8.39 
you’ll laught, tease Morgan, and go 
into your room to have a bath and 
change.” 

“I get it,” said Joan admiringly. 
“Genius, sometimes I think you’re 
too smart for your own good. Or 
mine either.” 

“That gives you seven minutes 
to turn on the water, make your 
change, turn off the water, and do 
the job. You could join us again at 
8.57.” 

“Quick bath,” Joan commented. 

“With company in, would any- 
body take more than a quick dip? 
If we ever are suspected, Morgan 
will say he was with me all the 
time and that you were out of his 
sight only for ten or twelve minutes 
— not long enough to walk to the 
end of the street.” 



“Genius,” said Joan, “I could kiss 
you.” 

“Save that for Morgan. I must 
say you’re doing a good job on him. 
He thinks you like him.” 

“I do like him,” said Joan warm- 
ly. “I think he’s cute.” 

“Cute,” McKinlay said in dis- 
gust. 

T> ILL had to go to the party, for 
it was really he who was in- 
vited, not Opal. 

McKinlay had arranged his and 
Joan’s research visit to Vokis fairly 
easily. The Conways had arrived 
four months earlier, however, and 
they’d had to give a genuine reason 
to be there permanently, so they 
had come in as immigrants. For all 
four participants, the whole plan 
had been complete, exact as to 
dates and times. 

Neither McKinlay nor Joan had 
the faintest idea where the Con- 
ways were or what they were doing, 
but that didn’t matter. Not the first 
time. 

Bill had been readily accepted 
as an immigrant because he was a 
top-grade precision tool cutter. 
There could be no fakery about 
that. You were good at your job or 
you weren’t, and Bill was. 

“Now look,” said Opal as they 
dressed for the party, “don’t come 
near me with a cocktail glass. If 
anybody drops a martini over this 
dress . .” 

Bill shuddered at the thought. 



174 



GALAXY 



“You’d better not dance either,” 
he said. 

“Why not?” 

“Somebody might step on it.” 

Opal looked at him with more 
favor than usual. “You’re right, Bill. 
Surprising, but you’re right. I 
won’t dance till afterward. And 
remember you’ve got to cover for 
Joan. This is the weak part of the 
scheme, counting on you to take 
care of emergencies, but there 
shouldn’t be any. Is your watch 
right?” 

It was an ordinary party, noth- 
ing remarkable about it, no notable 
people present. For the most part, 
the men were in the precision tool 
business. The women were merely 
their wives. 

But at such a gathering in 
Vanna, there was always a display 
of treasures worth fortunes. The 
host alone had objets d’art worth 
millions lying around all over the 
place. Given ten seconds, any ordi- 
nary thief could pick up a cool 
half-million. 

And Opal was no ordinary thief. 

When she and Bill arrived, she 
couldn’t help smiling with satis- 
faction. The party was in a vast 
lounge with a softly lit dance floor 
and dark corners galore. Any of the 
latter would do for her purpose. 
She pointed two out to Bill. 

This was going to be easy. She 
glanced down at her dress, a long 
black gown with a full skirt. There 
was nothing unusual about it ex- 

NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



cept that anything dropped down 
her bosom would not drop out. 

Then she glanced at her watch 
. 8.21. Not nearly time to get 
busy. She’d begin at 8.43. 

“And this is my wife, Opal,” 
Bill was saying. She smiled auto- 
matically at a fat woman and 
priced her necklace at four hundred 
thousand. 

nnWO hours before Morgan was 
due to arrive, McKinlay went 
into the bathroom, locked the door 
and ran the water. His coldly ana- 
lytical mind had come up with a 
possible snag. If the bathroom in 
the suite was wired for sound, with 
a C.O.S. man at the other end — 
and such things had to be consid- 
ered— Joan couldn’t use it as she 
planned. In the first place, the num- 
ber of baths she was going to have 
to take would be highly suspicious, 
and also their timing. In the sec- 
ond place, it would puzzle any lis- 
tener to hear somebody get into a 
bath and then listen to a lot of 
remarkably blank silence. 

So before he let her proceed, he 
checked for microphones. 

In their luggage had been a lit- 
tle gadget which wasn’t at all sus- 
picious, since it was used to check 
for breaks or bad connections in 
wires. It also, naturally, discovered 
wires where there weren’t sup- 
posed to be any. 

McKinlay switched it on. If 
there was a microphone and any- 

175 



one was listening, the listener 
would get frying noise and might 
guess that someone was testing for 
wires. A giveaway, but it couldn’t 
be helped. 

A weak, limited electrical field 
sought out line conductors and 
pointed them out. McKinlay got 
the light, the mirror demister, a 
power point and some metal orna- 
mentation. That was all. 

Encouraged, he adjusted the lit- 
tle instrument and checked for per- 
manent magnets, moving coils, 
ribbons, crystals. He found nothing. 

The water flow was silent, by 
pressure from below. Even if there 
was a microphone in one of the 
other rooms, it wouldn’t pick up 
sounds of the bath being filled. 

Satisfied, McKinlay opened the 
door silently and beckoned to 
Joan. He closed the door behind 
her quietly. The lounge radio was 
on, turned up loud. 

“It’s all right,” he murmured. 
“You can go ahead.” 

She put on a white bathing cap 
and started to slip off her wrap. 

“You staying?” she asked. 
There’s nothing you can do.” 

“I know,” he said, but made no 
move to go. 

She shrugged, dropped the wrap, 
stepped out of her shoes and low- 
ered herself into the bath. For a 
moment she hesitated, concentrat- 
ing. Then she lowered her head 
under the water so that she was 
submerged — and disappeared. 

176 



The level of the water changed 
slightly. Though the human body 
is largely composed of water, the 
average specific gravity is slightly 
different. Joan hadn’t been re- 
placed by her own volume of water, 
but by her own weight. 

McKinlay stared down at the 
water in the bath. It had become 
cooler and slightly cloudy . 

J OAN raised her head and saw 
the scene she had first fixed in 
her mind some months before. 
Three volcano peaks. Sand. Lava. 
Red rock. A leaden sky. 

She stood up in three feet of 
water and waded out of the lake. 

Teleportation was a rare talent, 
and teleports who could jump half 
across a planet to a transmitter 
were rarer still. First-stage tele- 
ports like Opal Conway could make 
the jump easily enough from a 
transmitter, but there were very 
few whose talents were highly de- 
veloped enough to tap the power 
of a transmitter half a world away 
and go right to it. Joan herself 
couldn’t have made the teleport if 
she hadn’t fixed every detail of the 
location firmly in her mind on the 
one occasion when she was actu- 
ally there. 

That was why she, not Mc- 
Kinlay, had had to set up the cache. 

The things she had hidden in the 
crack in the rock were undisturbed, 
which was no surprise. Even re- 
connaissance flights across this re-

gion were rare. The C.O.S. had no 
smuggling problem and conse- 
quently had little interest in pos- 
sible unauthorized landings in the 
wasteland. Vokis needed no tariff 
protection — consequently, smug- 
gling didn’t pay. 

From one of the cases, Joan took 
a black dress with a full skirt. Opal 
would be wearing a dress exactly 
like that. Joan laid it out ready, 
complete with accessories. From 
the same case she took a complete 
makeup kit. She would have to 
take it back with her. 

Usually she would teleport here, 
make her change to resemble Opal, 
switch with Opal at the agreed 
time, switch again soon afterward 
(Opal supplying the impetus the 
second time), restore her own face 
and figure, and teleport back to the 
hotel. 

But this time, if McKinlay’s ali- 
bi plan was to work, she’d have to 
make both changes in Vanna. It 
was dangerous only in that for an 
hour or two the makeup materials 
would be around in the suite, if 
anyone cared to look for them. 

C.O.S. would know all about 
teleportation, but would assume 
two things — that a transmitter on 
the spot was necessary, and that 
anyone who made a jump would be 
replaced instantly with his own 
mass in stone, soil or water from 
the place to which he’d gone. 

In the first assumption, they’d 
be wrong. In the second, with any 



luck, they could be deceived. 
Thieves of all kinds had known for 
ages that the best way of covering 
their tracks was to make it appear 
that nothing was missing. 

It may have been true that 
Shakespeare’s works weren’t writ- 
ten by him, but by another fellow 
of the same name. Similarly, when 
C.O.S. considered teleportation, as 
they inevitably would, it was hard- 
ly likely to occur to them that Opal 
Conway, instead of being replaced 
by 124 pounds of sand, had been 
replaced by 124 pounds of another 
girl made up to look like Opal 
Conway. 

As for Joan’s frequent teleports 
between the hotel in Vanna and the 
cache in the volcanic southern hem- 
isphere, the idea of teleporting 
from a bath to a lake was typical 
of McKinlay’s cunning. There was 
no suspicious sand or soil or rock 
to be disposed of somehow — only 
water which would drain down the 
pipe afterward, leaving no evi- 
dence whatever. Typical also of 
McKinlay’s plans was the fact that 
any inconvenience or discomfort 
they entailed — in this case, fre- 
quent duckings in cold water — 
was suffered by somebody else. 

Another thing occurred to Joan. 
She laid a big towel beside the 
black dress. She’d have to allow at 
least a minute to dry herself before 
switching with Opal. Fortunately 
this wasn’t one of the occasions 
when the substitution would be 



178 



GALAXY 



subjected to long and exacting scru- 
tiny. 

Now everything was ready. She 
went back to the lake, waded out 
in it, sat down in it and ducked her 
head under the water. 

This time it was gloriously easy, 
with the power she needed right 
there beside her. Even Opal Con- 
way would have no trouble. 

M organ arrived at the hotel, 
as expected, precisely at 
8.30. McKinlay was all set with a 
small tape recorder and a notebook. 
Joan was all set with a gown which 
plunged nearly far enough to make 
her bare-footed. 

Drinks were fixed. McKinlay ig- 
nored Morgan’s distraction and the 
way his eyes walked around the 
room with Joan. 

“For a start, Morgan,” he said, 
“can you tell me in one sentence 
why the C.O.S. is so good?’” 
Morgan could talk without his 
eyes, and proved it. “The public 
cooperates,” he said absently. 
“That’s the whole explanation. Sup- 
pose you, or anybody else, wanted 
to go to any other city on Vokis. 
You would have to tell us, and 
why. Otherwise you couldn’t go. If 
you even wanted to spend a night 
in any other part of this city, you 
would have to register in the new 
locality. Did you see any green 
boxes at the intersections?” 

“Sure. We wondered what they 
were.” 

NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



“C.O.S. posts. Tomorrow I’ll 
show you how to use one. If a 
friend asks you to stay the night, 
you register at a C.O.S. point. 
There’s a lot of other checks I { 
won’t go into now. Result of all I 
this is, whenever anything happens, j 
we can check back and tell who the 
criminal is before we leave the | 
office.” i 

“I don’t quite see how that 
works,” said McKinlay. 

The recorder was on. He didn’t 
have to pretend to be interested in 
this. He was most sincerely inter- 
ested in it. There are two sides to 
the law, and people on each side of 
it are equally interested in how it 
operates. 

Joan bent to give Morgan his 
second drink, and as she bent over 
him, he not unnaturally choked 
over the last of his first. 

“The real point,” said Morgan, 
recovering bravely, “is that Vo- 
kians accept it as their civic duty to 
help the C.O.S. Vannans don’t get 
angry when we ask questions or 
detain them a while or search them 
or raid their houses.” 

“Well, that must be a help to | 
you.” 

“Sure. We get gorgeous help 
from the public. They show every- 
thing. I mean—” 

Joan laughed, and McKinlay 
permitted himself a wintry smile as 
Morgan went red. 

“Joan, you’re not in on this,” 
said McKinlay firmly. “Go powder 



179 



your nose. Let Morgan and me talk 
in peace.” 

“No, please . .” Morgan began. 
“He’s just being polite,” McKin- 
lay said. 

“I can take a hint,” said Joan 
with mock dignity. “I go to wrap 
myself in sackcloth and ashes.” 
“No, don’t do that, Mrs. Mc- 
Kinlay. I only—” 

Joan smiled. “Get on with your 
work. I’ll take'a bath. But don’t be 
too long.” 

She left the room at 8.39 pre- 
cisely. 

houldn’t have brought her,” 
^ said McKinlay. “Now—” 
“Mow’d you come to marry her?” 
Morgan asked curiously. 

“I don’t know. How does any- 
body come to marry anybody?” 
“Wouldn’t have thought she was 
your type, that’s all.” Morgan 
shrugged, grinned. “How about 
reeling back the last thirty seconds 
or so?” 

McKinlay did so. From the tape 
recorder came the words: “Vannans 
don’t get angry when we ask ques- 
tions or detain them a while or 
search them or raid their houses.” 
“Back on Earth,” Morgan went 
on, “the police got hamstrtmg when 
people started screaming about 
personal privacy.” 

McKinlay nodded. “Can you 
blame them? People like to have 
personal privacy.” 

“Well, you can educate them 



out of it. Make everybody admit 
that people only shriek about vio- 
lation of privacy when they have 
something to hide.” 

“And it works?” 

“It works so long as you make 
it clear that you aren’t concerned 
about personal morals. If C.O.S. 
uncovers any irregularity that isn’t 
a civil crime, we simply forget it. 
And we’re very tough on black- 
mail. So if Jones is sleeping with 
Smith’s wife, he doesn’t holler 
‘Privacy!’ whenever we come near 
him. He tells us all we want to 
know, sometimes more than we 
want to know, and we move on. 
If Smith ever finds out, he doesn’t 
get it from us.” 

“And you mean to say that ex- 
plains the phenomenal record of 
C.O.S.?” 

“Explains a good part of it, 
anyway.” 

McKinlay reflected. “I don’t 
think Earth would stand for a situ- 
ation like that.” 

Morgan shrugged. “We don’t 
say C.O.S. methods would work 
anywhere. All we know is they 
work on our planet. Society gets 
the kind of law it deserves.” 

“Can you give me some illus- 
trations?” 

“Of course. Last week, a missing 
diamond turned up. If it had hap- 
pened on Earth, right at the be- 
ginning the police would’ve been 
stymied, because the woman, who 
had claimed insurance, would have

GALAXY 



said, ‘See my lawyer,’ and the man 
who originally gave it to her, who 
was married to somebody else, 
would have said, ‘I have nothing 
to say,’ and the man who tried to 
sell it would have said he found 
it in the street, and so on. As it 
was—” 

Joan’s voice sounded plaintive- 
ly through the bedroom door : 
“Bring me a drink, Greg.” 

“Come out and get it,” said Mc- 
Kinlay, knowing she was now 
Opal’s double. 

“Stinker!” she said, and her 
steps receded. 

It was 8.44 

’^HEN she found herself 
” crouched under a flat stone. 
Opal pulled up her skirt and de- 
tached the bag she had worn un- 
derneath. She left it where it 
lay on the sand. Joan would at- 
tend to it. 

With it she placed a note which 
gave details of the next operation. 
She was careful to move as little 
as possible, for later she expected 
to be searched. Sand in her shoes 
or in her hair might be hard to 
explain. However, now that she 
knew the kind of hideout Joan had 
picked, she could go to the beach 
at Vanna every few days and any 
questions about sand in her hair 
would be answered before they 
were asked. 

Joan weighed several ounces 
more than Opal did. So now that 

NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



Opal no longer carried her loot, 
she had to replace its weight. She 
did so by drinking deeply from the 
bottle of water which Joan had 
left her. 

After that, she was ready. She 
didn’t bother to fix the location 
in her mind. She couldn’t teleport 
there an 5 rway. 

All the teleporting Opal had to 
do was the second switch. Joan 
did all the rest. 

Opal allowed just enough time 
for Bill to steer Joan into another 
dim corner of the lounge. Then 
she laboriously built up the whole 
scene in her mind — location, tem- 
perature, sight, sound. Bill . 

And she was in Bill’s arms 
again. 

CiTVFO, we get plenty of mur- 
” ders,” Morgan said. 

McKinlay raised his eyebrows. 
“Though you solve them so easily? 
I’d have thought Vokis was one 
place where murder didn’t pay.” 

“Seems when a man gets around 
to murder, it doesn’t matter to him 
whether he’s caught or not. Hardly 
anybody kills somebody really ex- 
pecting to get away with it. Very 
damned few murders, statistically, 
are professional jobs, here or any- 
where else. Husband hacks his 
wife’s head off with an axe and 
then rings us and tells us about 
it. Man stabs ...” 

He stopped as Joan emerged, 
glowing from her bath. It was 8.59. 

181 



“Go right ahead,” she said. “I 
can’t be distracting you now, can 
I?” She was wearing a wrap which 
revealed nothing but her face, 
hands and feet. 

“Mrs. McKinlay,” said Morgan 
frankly, “you’d distract me if you 
had on a spacesuit” 

She smiled and sat down. 
“Glyn,” she said, “I like you. And 
when are you going to get around 
to calling me Joan?” 

Morgan took about fifteen min- 
utes to get back on track. And 
soon after that the phone rang. 

“It’ll be for me,” he said. “My 
department knows I’m here.” 

He listened for a while, saying 
practically nothing. Then he put 
the phone down and turned to 
McKinlay. 

“Like to see a case?” he asked. 
“What do you mean?” 

“Jewel robbery at a party twen- 
ty minutes ago. I left orders to 
call me if anything interesting 
turned up. You can come and see 
the C.O.S. at work if you like.” 
“Why, sure,” McKinlay said 
with much more enthusiasm than 
he felt, for this wasn’t part of the 
plan. “Will I see you catch the 
thief?” 

Morgan grinned. “I doubt that. 
But you’ll see us establish the 
method. Then we’ll find who the 
thief was. Obviously he’ll be gone. 
If he’s still there, then you will 
see us catch him.” 

“Can I come too?” Joan pleaded. 



They might search the suite, 
McKinlay thought. Just on gen- 
eral principles. He was glad when 
Morgan said: “Better not, Mrs. — 
Joan. We’ll have to rush if we’re 
to see ansrthing, and you’re not 
ready.” 

As they went, McKinlay was 
hoping Joan realized the impor- 
tance of having the suite ready for 
a C.O.S. check at all times. Work- 
ing against the C.O.S., it was im- 
possible to be too careful. 

VJ^HEN Morgan and McKinlay 
” arrived, C.O.S. men and 
women were just finishing search- 
ing all the guests. Their thorough- 
ness was obvious. 

“Do you really expect to find 
anything?” McKinlay asked Mor- 
gan. 

“Very unlikely. But that’s not 
the point. This eliminates one 
thing. Half the job is finding things 
to eliminate. Excuse me a minute 
while I find out the facts.” 

McKinlay was left standing in 
a corner. When he moved, one of 
the C.O.S. men came over and 
asked him politely to stay where 
he was. McKinlay began to see 
how meticulous C.O.S. was. Al- 
though they had nothing on him, 
he wasn’t to be allowed to wan- 
der about. It wasn’t likely that he 
had any part in the robbery, but 
they saw no sense in taking 
chances. 

One of the last of the women 



182 



GALAXY 



to be searched, Opal Conway, 
came past She knew better than 
to do anything more than glance 
at him incuriously. McKinlay 
could realize it was giving her a 
fright to see him* there. 

Morgan returned. “Guess I 
should have waited for more in- 
formation before I brought you 
along here,” he said ruefully. 
“We’re not going to find anything.” 
“What do you mean?” 

“Just that. A lot of stuff has 
been stolen and it’s decidedly 
gone. Nobody has left, nobody left 
at any time. Must be one of those 
gimmick cases. You know, a theft 
that depends on an idea, a new 
technique, perhaps a new varia- 
tion of an old one.” 

“You mean you won’t solve it?” 
“Oh, we’ll solve it, sure. We 
never give up, you see.” 

“What sort of gimmick could it 
be? I thought there was nothing 
really new in crime.” 

Morgan was quite unconcerned 
about the affair, not seeming even 
irritated that when he brought 
somebody along to show how 
quickly and efficiently C.O.S. could 
crack a case, it should happen that 
C.O.S. wasn’t going to crack it after 
all, certainly not immediately. Mc- 
Kinlay couldn’t help being irri- 
tated by his confidence. Couldn’t 
they see they were up against 
something big this time? 

“Depends who worked it,” said 
Morgan, “and how much trouble 

NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



he went to. Suppose it was Bry- 
ans, the guy who owns the place. 
He could easily have worked 
something— false wall, hiding place 
in one of the 'armchairs, anything 
like that. We’ve had a good look 
round, but short of tearing every- 
thing to bits, we can’t be complete- 
ly sure the stuff isn’t still here. 
But that would be stupid. He’d 
never get away with it.” 

McKinlay became even more 
irritated. Morgan treated this as 
if a horse had bolted, saying in 
effect: “Don’t worry, he’ll be back 
in a couple of hours.” Morgan 
didn’t seem to have any concep- 
tion of the fact that this was the 
start of the biggest series of rob- 
beries in history. 

“What kind of gimmick?” Mc- 
Kinlay insisted. 

“Well, we had a similar case at 
a garden party once. Turned out 
the stuff had been flown away in 
a small radio-operated helicopter, 
no more than a foot long. Couldn’t 
be that here, but that’s the kind 
of thing people try. One obvious 
thing to investigate is teleporta- 
tion. Know anything about it?” 

“Can’t say I ever saw it done,” 
said McKinlay cautiously. 

“It can be done all right, by 
certain gifted individuals. Only 
there are three snags. One, you 
can’t send inanimate objects by 
themselves; somebody has to take 
them. Two, when something goes, 
something has to replace it. Three, 

183 



teleportation needs apparatus. So 
if it was done here, we can’t — 
at the moment — figure out how.” 
Opal reappeared, followed by 
the two women officers who had 
been searching the female guests. 
Morgan looked up and they shook 
their heads. 

“Well, that’s it,” said Morgan 
cheerfully. “Nothing to see here. 
We’d better get back. Sorry I 
brought you out. I thought we’d 
turn up something.” 

“I’m glad I came. Maybe I’ll 
get an unsolved case for the book. 
Even C.O.S. can’t be perfect.” 
Morgan shook his head. “Never 
claimed we were. All the same, 
you won’t get an unsolved case, 
Greg. We’ve never had one yet.” 

I^r organ’s confidence rattled 
McKinlay as well as irritat- 
ing him. But days passed and 
nothing happened that justified 
Morgan’s confidence. 

The second job went without a 
hitch, and since it was a theft 
from an art gallery with a lot of 
other people in it at the time. 
Opal’s name didn’t get on the 
record again. On the third occa- 
sion, she was one of about three 
hundred women and forty men in 
a store. On the fourth occasion, she 
was searched again, and since by 
this time the C.O.S. could be 
trusted to be highly suspicious of 
Mrs. Opal Conway — all taken 
into consideration in the plan — 



the fifth job was carried through 
without her. 

This time Bill and Opal were 
out of town, at Meshnik, a hun- 
dred miles away, and while Joan 
worked alone. Opal gave herself 
a cast-iron alibi. Joan got clear 
with several himdred thousand in 
cash at a beach house, took it to 
the distant cache and came back 
within seconds to join in the lamen- 
tations over the theft. 

On this occasion, the telltale 
sand which proved somebody had 
teleported was deposited in a little 
pile on the beach, which was a 
good place to hide it. Though Mc- 
Kinlay hated this particular job 
for several reasons, one of which 
was its brute simplicity, it did 
show the C.O.S. very clearly that 
the series of big thefts which was 
beginning to worry Vannans, if 
not the C.O.S., didn’t necessarily 
involve Opal Conway. 

McKinlay was nearly as smart 
as he thought he was. He knew 
to a lot less than an inch the 
difference between a suspicious 
circumstance that really looked as 
if it meant something, and the 
suspicious circumstance that just 
happened to the most innocent 
people. 

Opal Conway, necessarily, was 
going to be around when many 
of the snatches took place. The 
C.O.S., necessarily, was going to 
suspect Opal, without being able 
to prove anything. It must there- 



184 



GALAXY 



fore be clearly demonstrated on 
several occasions that Opal was 
no more than the young wife of 
a tool cutter, and that though 
sometimes she happened to be 
around when things disappeared, 
things could disappear when she 
quite clearly wasn’t. 

Naturally, the Vannan press 
had found a name for the thief. 
He was Shortly. Shortly lifts 
$90,000 — or whatever sum or 
value — became quite a common 
headline. 

Shortly got his name because 
the C.O.S., asked about progress 
in the case, usually said, “We 
expect an arrest shortly.” 

Morgan’s early confidence be- 
gan to wear thin. He kept McKin- 
lay in touch, sometimes taking 
him to the scenes of Shortly coups 
and going over the ground with 
him. He continued to insist that 
it was only a matter of time. 

TTIS anxiety showed itself, how- 
ever, when he said to Mc- 
Kinlay once : “Greg, about this 
book of yours. It gave us a kick 
when we heard about it, and I 
know from what I’ve read of it 
that it’s going to be a fine job. 
But look — you’ll be fair about 
these Shortly jobs, won’t you? I 
mean—” 

“I’ll be fair, I hope,” said Mc- 
Kinlay, “but that means telling the 
truth, not hushing it up.” 

“Sure, but what I meant was 

NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



you’ll wait till the case is com- 
plete?” 

“Until you catch Shortly, you 
mean? Well, you know we’re 
booked to leave in three weeks.” 

“Yes, but . Look, Greg, what 
I’m trying to say is, just as a favor 
to us, why not wait till the case is 
closed before you publish the 
book?” 

McKinlay was enjoying this 
very much. 

He adopted a judicial air. “We 
go back in three weeks,” he said. 
“Two months to reach Earth. 
Probably three months after we 
arrive before the book comes out. 
Any time in the next five or six 
months, I’ll be glad to rewrite the 
Shortly story if you can send me 
the final details. Is that fair?” 

“Sure, Greg,” Morgan said 
gratefully. “That’s fine. I was a 
little scared you were going to go 
back to New York and rush out 
a book called The Case That Baf- 
fled The C.O.S. And we’d look 
kind of silly, even if we caught 
this Shortly character the follow- 
ing week.” 

“You’ve got it all wrong,” said 
McKinlay. “Of course I want the 
book to sell. And this case—” 

“That’s what I mean. You could 
write this thing up so we’d look 
like-” 

McKinlay was shaking his head. 
“Morgan, the selling point of my 
book is that C.O.S. is good. I’m 
not praising it extravagantly; peo- 

185 



pie get that sort of thing in the 
commercials and grow tired of it. 
If C.O.S. was just any ordinary 
police force, what would be the 
point in the book? How could I 
expect a lot of people to read it? 
It would be far better from my 
point of view if you caught 
Shortly.” 

“I see,” said Morgan slowly. 
“Yet sometimes I’ve got the idea 
you were laughing at us over this 
case.” 

McKinlay paused to think of a 
good answer, knowing it had to be 
good. “Frankly,” he said, “the 
tougher you find this case, the bet- 
ter it suits me. Only you’ve got 
to win in the end. It’s got to be 
The Case That Nearly Baffled 
C.O.S. See what I mean?” 

Morgan nodded, satisfied. 

^ I ^ HERE was a certain irony in 
the situation that when not 
chasing Shortly and when not be- 
ing Shortly, Morgan and Joan 
spent most of their free time to- 
gether. At first Morgan had been 
scrupulously correct in inviting 
McKinlay along too, or asking per- 
mission before taking Joan any- 
where. But when he found Mc- 
Kinlay really preferred to spend 
the evenings working on his book 
— McKinlay played his part to 
the ends of his fingers — and was 
glad to have Joan out of the way, 
Morgan fell into the habit of tak- 
ing her out to places where a 



man wouldn’t normally take an- 
other man’s wife. 

They had a lot in common and 
it was fun finding it all out. Joan 
found Morgan understood a lot 
of things she wouldn’t have ex- 
pected a cop to understand. Mor- 
gan found Joan ready and willing 
to forget she was supposed to be 
married, except for a few basic 
reservations, and he liked her not 
only for her readiness and willing- 
ness but also for the basic reserva- 
tions. 

On these occasions, Morgan 
didn’t talk about his work and 
Joan didn’t exhibit any interest in 
it. They had other things to oc- 
cupy them. 

Once, however, they almost col- 
lided with the Conways, and 
though nobody admitted knowing 
anyone else, Morgan murmured 
later: “See that girl? She was one 
of the principal suspects in the 
Shortly case.” 

“Was?” said Joan. 

“Yes. We know now she hadn’t 
anything to do with the last af- 
fair.” 

Joan was perturbed. If it was 
true that C.O.S. no longer sus- 
pected Opal, fine. But in the first 
place, she didn’t believe it; and in 
the second, why should Morgan 
say such a thing to her, anyway, 
unless to observe her reaction? 

She made certain she looked 
completely disinterested in the 
whole affair. 



186 



GALAXY 



Another thing was worrying her. 
Although she had decided long 
ago that there was more in life 
than romance, she was a woman 
after all. And she had known for 
some time that in other circum- 
stances she could go for Morgan. 

Nothing was going to come of 
it, of course. She wasn’t the kind 
of sentimental fool who’d confess 
everything just because she hap- 
pened to fall in love with a cop. 

Nevertheless, it was galling to 
meet somebody who could be the 
man of her life when she hap- 
pened to be tied to another man 
by something stronger than mar- 
riage — self-interest. 

Joan was beginning to wish she 
had come to Vokis cast as Mc- 
Kinlay’s sister instead of his wife. 

/^PAL and Joan cooperated on 
another job, and then Joan 
did a second alone. 

That left only two of the series. 
McKinlay’s plan was that after 
the next to the last Opal would 
be strongly suspected, picked up 
and questioned, preferably by lie 
detector (Opal being conditioned 
for any contest with any lie de- 
tector). 

While Opal was in C.O.S. hands, 
Joan — on her own — was to pull 
the last and greatest of all the 
Shortly robberies. 

However, that was in the future. 
The present affair concerned a 
tray of watches wonderfully de- 

NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



signed, fantastically expensive, 
which Opal was to lift from one 
of the leading jewelers in Vanna. 

It was a straightforward, rou- 
tine affair, and ever5rthing went 
according to plan until Joan, who 
had switched with Opal, found 
herself face to face with Glyn 
Morgan just inside the jewelry 
store. 

She had too much presence of 
mind to show by her expression 
that she knew him. Morgan mere- 
ly glanced at her indifferently and 
passed behind her. Seeing the in- 
difference in his eyes, Joan was 
glad she looked like Opal and 
not like herself. It was an unpleas- 
ant shock to see a man look at 
you and just not care — particu- 
larly Glyn. 

Opal, she knew, was at the 
cache, leaving the watches there, 
and would switch with her again 
very soon. Rather than go out into 
the brightly sunlit street, Joan 
paused to look at a display inside 
the store. 

Suddenly her arm was grasped 
firmly, and she turned to face 
Morgan again. She looked at him 
blankly as if she had never seen 
him before. 

“You’ve got it wrong,” said 
Morgan quietly. “You are sup- 
posed to know me.” 

“Of course I know you, Mr. 
Morgan,” said Joan in a good ap- 
proximation of Opal’s voice. 

The grasp on her arm tightened, 

187 



and at Morgan’s nod, two men 
closed in on them. 

“That just about sews it up, 
Joan,” said Morgan, and Joan 
couldn’t help starting. 

“Joan? What are you talking 
about?” she demanded. There was 
nothing she could do but play it 
out. “Am I supposed to have done 
something?” 

“You’re supposed to have stolen 
twenty-one watches.” 

“Is this where I give myself 
away by saying, ‘It’s a lie— there 
were only seventeen’?” 

“You’ve already given yourself 
away. Opal Conway doesn’t know 
me from Adam.” 

J OAN ignored the more serious 
thing, the fact that he had 
called her Joan, and stuck to the 
matter of the watches. 

“What am I supposed to have 
done with them?” she demanded 
in Opal’s sarcastic tones. “Stuck 
them in the elastic of my panties?” 
Morgan looked at her sorrow- 
fully. “Joan, you just wouldn’t be- 
lieve how thorough we are. When 
we decided to test for a connec- 
tion between Joan McKinlay and 
Opal Conway, it didn’t seem like- 
ly, but that didn’t matter — we 
never cancel a line of investiga- 
tion just because it doesn’t seem 
likely. Look.” He lifted the hem 
of her skirt and showed it to her. 

“Looks all right to me,” Joan 
said. 




“That’s just it. One of our girls 
cut a little hole in Opal’s dress. 
Yours hasn’t got it. The other 
thing you can’t see, but we can. 
When I kissed you last night, I 
stuck on the back of your neck 
a tiny mole that you didn’t have 
before. You’ve still got it. Joan, 
you—” 

He suddenly stared and cursed. 
The girl in his grasp had . 
flickered. And in the hem of the 
dress he was still holding, there 
was a small, neat cut. 

He spun her around. There was 
no mole on the back of her neck. 

“Will you kindly tell me what 
this is all about?” Opal demanded 
tartly. 

“But there’s no transmitter!” he 
exclaimed wildly, looking at the 
two men. “How could—” 

It was not until then that the 
full explanation dawned on him. 

“Two teleports,” he said. “That’s 
it. You can both do it, you and 
Joan. So you never need a trans- 
mitter on the spot, and you never 
leave any ballast around.” 

“Who is this nut?” Opal asked 
the two C.O.S. men. 

“That isn’t going to do you any 
good,” said Morgan, and Opal 
knew he meant it. 

V|^HEN Joan arrived at the 
^ cache, she immediately tele- 
ported to the hotel in Vanna, 
knowing she had a few minutes 
clear before Morgan, not being a 



teleport, could get there. She took 
McKinlay into the bathroom, the 
only room they knew for sure was 
not tapped. 

“Morgan knows,” she said rapid- 
ly. “He knew I wasn’t Opal. He’ll 
be here in a couple of minutes.” 

McKinlay didn’t curse. He 
hadn’t time. “You switched while 
he held you?” 

“Opal did. He didn’t know how 
it was done then, but he must 
know now. He isn’t a fool. Now 
what. Genius?” 

McKinlay had only a short time 
to make up his mind. Bluff it out? 
Take off? Or what? 

He didn’t need long. “Go to the 
cache,” he said, “and stay there. 
Kimber will land in five days. The 
emergency rations will keep you 
going till then. I’ll tell them I don’t 
know anything. Didn’t know you 
were a teleport. Didn’t know any- 
thing. I may get away with it.” 

“You might,” Joan agreed. “And 
you might not. People aren’t as 
dumb as you think. Genius.” 

She wasted no more time. Once 
more the bath contained nothing 
but cloudy water, rapidly gurgling 
away. And it was only a few min- 
utes later that Morgan arrived. 

He tried to take a strong line 
at first, but when McKinlay got,^, 
angry and insisted he didn’t im- 'i 
derstand a word Morgan was say- 
ing, Morgan had to explain, and 
McKinlay knew that was his first 
victory.

Soon Morgan was tacitly agree- 
ing that McKinlay might not have 
known an5^hing about his wife’s 
implication on the Shortly rob- 
beries. Now the beauty of McKin- 
lay’s plan emerged. i 

They had nothing on him, be- 
cause he hadn’t done anything. 
Joan and Opal between them had 
done it all. Joan was where they’d 
never find her, and they’d never 
break Opal down. Bill, yes, but 
Bill knew practically nothing. 

McKinlay was questioned for 
hours. He never wavered. If Joan 
had been engaged in anything il- 
legal, he didn’t know anything 
about it. He didn’t believe it any- 
way. 

And only gradually as the hours 
passed did he allow himself to be- 
come surprised, hurt, and puzzled 
as Joan didn’t appear. 

When they stopped questioning 
him, he was exultant. He’d extri- 
cate himself yet. 

The only thing that worried 
him was the fact that the C.O.S. 
had Opal. They’d never crack her 
by ordinary methods, but there 
were ways in which even Opal 
could be broken down. 

Then he relaxed. There were in- 
/ terplanetary regulations on things 
like that. C.O.S. could jail them, 
but it couldn’t brainwash them. 

Ci'VT OU’RE wasting your time,” 
said Opal bluntly. 

“With McKinlay we are,” Mor- 



gan admitted. He was confident 
again, relieved. The Shortly case 
might not be solved yet, but it 
was certainly on its way toward 
solution. Now all he wanted was 
Joan. In two senses. 

And he fully expected to get 
her — in both senses. 

He was practically sure now 
that she’d never been married to 
McKinlay — a fact which he 
found exceedingly cheering. 

“When are you going to let me 
go?” Opal demanded. 

“Never,” he said, and even Opal 
was chilled by the way he said it. 
“Let me tell you something. Opal 
Conway.” 

“Go ahead.” 

“You’re going to work with us.” 

Opal studied his face, amused. 
“You really think I will, don’t 
you?” 

“Everybody does,” he told her. 

“But not me. They’ve got reason 
to help you. I don’t. And you 
can’t give me any reason to.” 

“That’s just it,” he said with in- 
furiating certainty. “There’s al- 
ways good reason for people to 
work with us. All we have to do 
is find it.” 

“You can’t show me good 
reason.” 

“There is a C.O.S. Fleet,” said 
Morgan thoughtfully. “Not a large 
navy, but quite large enough to 
catch any ship that tries to land 
on any uninhabited region. Do I 
interest you?” 



NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



191 



“Not remotely.” 

“I’m only making out a case. 
There must be a ship. We’ll catch 
it. But that doesn’t mean we’ll 
catch Joan there — she may not be 
aboard.” 

Opal’s hard laugh had real 
amusement in it. “You’ll never 
catch her.” 

“Ultimately, we must. You 
know that perfectly well. Who- 
ever she is, she can teleport only 
from there and back to there. We 
know now that she can teleport to 
a transmitter as well as from it. 
But even she can’t teleport from 
a place where there’s no trans- 
mitter to another place where 
there’s no transmitter. So we must 
catch her eventually.” 

“Maybe. What has all this to 
do with me?” 

“A lot. You can help us, and 
I think you will. Because I’m in 
love with Joan.” 

Opal’s hard laugh rang out 
again. “What’s the idea of that 
brilliant piece of fantasy?” 

“Your only reason for not help- 
ing us is loyalty. No, I’m not 
making jokes. This scheme could 
only work if you four didn’t cross 
each other. Even now, when we’ve 
got you cold, you won’t rat on 
McKinlay or Joan. But what if I 
could convince you that it really is 
better for Joan if you do rat on 
her?” 

“You can’t.” 

“I can try,” Morgan said. 



1V|' cKINLAY was disturbed 
when he was taken into a 
room in the C.O.S. headquarters 
with Glyn Morgan, Opal and Bill 
Conway, but he didn’t show it. 

“Who are these people?” he 
asked Morgan. 

“Look, if all you can do is go 
on acting that faded old part,” said 
Morgan wearily, “why don’t you 
just clam up? Opal has decided 
to help us.” 

McKinlay said nothing, know- 
ing how often this tactic worked. 
He didn’t look at Opal. 

“She’s helping us because I’ve 
convinced her that it’s best for 
Joan. And even for you. You’re 
not going to write that book after 
all, McKinlay. Tell me, did you 
ever really mean to write it?” 
“Since I only have a faded old 
part to play,” said McKinlay cold- 
ly, “I’d better clam up.” 

“Okay,” said Morgan agree- 
ably. “Now first of all, just to make 
you happy, I want to tell you that 
we captured a small ship in space 
this morning. The pilot’s name was 
George Kimber. Unfortunately, 
we couldn’t determine exactly 
where he intended to land.” 

“I can’t see what interest that 
information, if true, can be ex- 
pected to arouse in me.” 

“Yes, you can, McKinlay. May- 
be you can understand now why 
Opal is going to help us.” 

McKinlay believed the bit about 
about George Kimber— it sounded 



192 



GALAXY 



true. Anger and disappointment 
goaded him to say: “And what 
can she do, may I ask? No doubt 
she has been the guiding spirit 
behind this alleged plan?”< 

“Touches you on the raw, does 
it? No, you were the planner, Mc- 
Kinlay, and you did a fair job. 
All the same. Opal was and is 
more important than you.” 

McKinlay swallowed his resent- 
ment. It was quite obvious what 
Morgan was trying to do — goad 
him into making damaging admis- 
sions. He said nothing. 

4CCOMEWHERE in the south- 
ern hemisphere,” said Mor- 
gan, “Joan is waiting, hoping Kim- 
ber will land. He won’t. By this 
time, she must be wishing some 
of the loot she has at her feet was 
eatable. I guess she’d trade a for- 
tune or two in jewels for a ham 
sandwich. We don’t know within 
fifteen million square miles where 
she is, and it would take weeks, 
maybe months or even years, to 
find her.” 

He paused and pulled a can- 
vas cover off a cabinet. 

“But there’s an easier way of 
sewing the whole thing up,” he 
said. “Know what this is, Mc- 
Kinlay?” 

McKinlay knew. He stared at 
it balefully. 

Opal stepped up to the cabinet 
and checked the settings. She 
nodded to Morgan. 



“Okay,” she said, and closed her 
eyes. 

McKinlay threw himself at her 
in a blind, murderous rage. He 
knew that by doing so, he was for 
the first time admitting his part 
in the Shortly robberies, knew that 
to the last he should pretend to 
know nothing. But the sight of 
Opal working for the C.O.S. was 
too much for him. 

Morgan jumped forward, but 
it wasn’t he who stopped McKin- 
lay. It was Bill. He tripped Mc- 
Kinlay and then stared down at 
him in horror, terrified of his 
wrath. 

Morgan pulled McKinlay to his 
feet and marched him to the other 
side of the room. 

“Stay where you are,” he said, 
and patted his pocket significant- 
ly. “Opal?” 

She closed her eyes again. 

Suddenly she was Joan. 

There was no attempt at im- 
perceptible substitution this time. 
Joan was thin and wan and pale, 
wearing no makeup, her hair lank 
and stringy, her dress ragged, her 
feet bare. She blinked around her 
incredulously as Morgan snapped 
off the transmitter and grabbed 
her arm. 

He didn’t argue with her, not at 
first. At first he only kissed her. 

Vj^HEN she understood the situ- 
ation, Joan tried to teleport 
back to the cache. 



NO PLACE FOR CRIME 



193 



Morgan shook his head. “This 
time you can’t do it,” he said. 
“Opal has switched off the unit.” 
Joan wasn’t as cautious as Mc- 
Kinlay had been. She said a few 
hard things about Opal. 

“I don’t think you’re quite fair 
to her,” said Morgan judicially. 
“She knows more than you do. 
Once we caught George Kimber, 
what was the point in leaving you 
there to starve?” 

“I could have teleported any- 
where on this world,” said Joan. 

“No, you couldn’t. Only to 
places you know, and they’re all 
in Vanna. Opal did no more than 
put you out of your misery, Joan.” 
McKinlay swore bitterly. Ab- 
ruptly Joan staggered, and Mor- 
gan caught her in his arms again. 

“What would you do for a sand- 
wich?” he asked temptingly. 

“This may be a joke to you,” 
said Joan, “but it isn’t to me. 
What’s going to happen to us?” 
“Nothing very terrible. Life im- 
prisonment, that’s all.” 

He said it so casually that it 
took Joan a couple of seconds to 
understand him. 

“You can’t do that,” she 
breathed. 

“We can and will. You’re go- 
ing to stay on Vokis, Joan. I hope 
there’ll be compensations.” 

He looked across at McKinlay. 
“That book of yours could never 
have been authentic, McKinlay. 



It would have had to miss out the 
most important thing, because we 
keep it secret. You kept asking 
rne why C.O.S. was so good, and 
t could never tell you. It’s good 
because it consists of people who’d 
rather work for it than go to jail. 
People who know crime inside 
out. People like you, McKinlay, ^ 
and Opal, and you, Joan — and 
me. Didn’t you once say we had i i 
a lot in common?” ^ 

'C' OR a moment, she didn’t un- 
derstand that either. 

“After this, C.O.S. will be even 
better,” Morgan said. “Two tele- 
ports. We can certainly use you, 
Joan. I wasn’t a teleport, just an 
ordinary safecracker. Does that an- 
swer your question, McKinlay?” 
Joan laughed at McKinlay’s ex- 
pression. “Genius, I always said 
you were too smart for your own 
good. Now look what you’ve done. 
You’ve made yourself a cop.” 

“You’re not married to him?” 
Morgan asked quickly. 

“Why, what’s it to you?” 

“You know what it is to me.” 

But he didn’t pursue the topic 
right then. “Now I guess we should 
bring Opal back. McKinlay, you’ll 
be quite useful too. Any time / 
some other smart op>erator tries 
out a new heist gimmick, it’ll be 
up to you to figure it out for us. y 
You’ll like that.”
