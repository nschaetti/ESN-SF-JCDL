SINCE the writings of Jules Verne and 
H. G. Wells, science fiction— often 
termed “future fiction” — has fasci- 
nated alert minds. Not only has it 
entertained, it has predicted much o( 
the far-ranging scientific and social 
change now upon us. 

In GALAXY, the finest authors of 
the genre continue to speculate, to 
predict, to tackle the prime problems 
already shaping tomorrow. Ecology- 
space exploration — nuclear promise 
and threat — energy— social evolution 
and biological revolution— these and 
other fields are probed by imaginative 
stories uniquely exciting and reward- 
ing. So let your fancy run free. Sub-

MACK REYNOLDS 



And the men of the village said 
unto hint, “If whilst ye guard the 
sheep a wolf appears, then blow 
thy horn and cry 'Wolf and we 
will come to succor thee. ” 

— Old Fairy Story 



U p until then, it had been an un- 
usually uneventful night, they 
hadn't even descended once. But 
now the screen lit up with large red 
letters and numbers, H-13 K-22. 

A voice said urgently, "Emer- 
gency distress signal from citizen 
with wrist alarm." 

Patrolman Jim Kelly hit the drop 
lever with the butt of his right hand 
and they started down. 

His partner knew the coordinates 
of their patrol area by heart. Tad 
Boleslaw snapped, “Corner of 
Locust and MacArthur. And, by 
Christ, there they are.” 

The police helio-jet came swoop- 
ing in. 

“On the ball. Tad," Kelly said, 
voice tense. 

But Tad Boleslaw was already 
whipping his Police .38 Recoilless 
from its quick draw holster, his 
hand on the door next to him. They 
could make out two figures below, 
in the otherwise deserted streets. 
“Stick-up romp,” Kelly growled. 
The other patrolman didn’t 



bother to answer that obvious state- 
ment. 

Between the two small figures 
below there was suddenly a lance of 
Hame. 

“Oh, Christ, he nailed him,” 
Boleslaw groaned. "Well, at least 
we’ll get the bastard.” 

When they swept in, one of the 
figures was sprawled over the 
gutter, half his .body in the street, 
half on the sidewalk. Boleslaw 
vaulted out while they were still five 
or six feet off the ground and went 
charging up, .38 in hand. 

"Drop that gun!” he yelled. 

The other was standing, facing 
him, his hands at his sides and two 
feet or so out from his body. He had 
a gun in his right. 

He said, “I’d rather not. It might 
damage it.” 

“Drop that gun,” Boleslaw said 
dangerously. He had come to a 
halt. 

“Why not just take it from me?” 
the other said mildly. “You’ve got 
me covered." 

The patrolman scowled. This 
was a new' one. 

Kelly came running up, weapon 
in hand. He circled around, taking 
care not to get in the potential line 
of fire, came up behind the other 
and grabbed the gun in question. 
He slipped it into a pocket and gave 



7 




(he gunman a thorough frisking. 

“Keep him covered,” he told his 
partner and went over and stared 
down at the body. There was a 
gaping hole in the fallen one’s 
chest, the blood had already 
stopped pulsing. It was a young- 
ster, probably in his late teens. 
Near his right hand was an old 
fashioned automatic pistol. 

Kelly turned back to the man 
Boleslaw was covering. “You the 
one sent in the emergency alarm on 
the wrist gismo?” 

“Yes.” 

“What happened?” 

“Stick-up, I guess.” 

Boleslaw said, “You must be 
awful quick on the draw if you took 
him when he already had you 
covered." 

"Thanks. I guess he wasn’t ex- 
pecting me to be armed. When he 
heard your cruiser coming in, he 
looked up . startled. That was 
long enough.” 

The two patrolmen sized him up. 
He was an unprepossessing man 
somewhere in his early fifties. He 
was a bit under average in size and 
could have used another ten 
pounds or so. He wore a mustache, 
and shouldn’t have; he didn’t have 
enough hair on his upper lip. He 
also wore spectacles, which were 
rapidly becoming an anachronism 
in these days of eye surgery and the 
new model contact lenses. 

Kelly thought inwardly, “No 
wonder the kid let him get the drop 
on him. He doesn’t look as though 



he could kill time.” 

But then something else came to 
him and he said, “Aren’t you 
Buddy Brothers? Seems to me I’ve 
seen you down at the pistol range.” 

“I’m getting a little old to be 
called Buddy any more. The 
name’s Charles Brothers. Yes, I’m 
kind of a junior member of the 
Police Pistol Team. 1 can’t compete 
because I’m only a CAP. I’m a 
member of the City Auxiliary 
Police.” He added, a touch of pride 
there, “It’s too bad, because I can 
shoot circles around most of the 
boys." 

Patrolman Boleslaw said, in re- 
sponse to the incoming whine of 
sirens, “Here comes the meat- 
wagon. This won’t take long, Mr. 
Brothers. Then we’ll run you down 
to headquarters and you can make 
a statement.” 

“Sure, boys. I’ve been through 
this before.” 

Tad Boleslaw eyed him in sur- 
prise and said, “You have?” 

“Yes,” Brothers said, looking 
about as though in explanation. 
“This is a pretty tough neighbor- 
hood.” 

“What in the hell are you doing 
here, this time of the night?” 

“Walking home from work. I’m 
on the swing shift. 1 get off at mid- 
night.” 

Tw o vehicles, one an ambulance, 
came swooping in. Uniformed offi- 
cers, a plainclothesnian and two 
white jacketed younger men with a 
stretcher spilled out.

GALAXY 




The plainclothesman, obviously 
in charge, looked over the scene 
without change of expression. He 
had seen the scene before, though 
usually roles were reversed. 
Usually, it was the citizen stretched 
out on the street, the stick-up man 
caught, gun in hand, or shot down 
when he tried to resist or escape. 
Kelly handed the gun over to him. 

The newcomer was a little gone 
to weight, was tired of eyes and his 
hat, shoved back, indicated that he 
was beginning to bald. He smoked 
a well charred, short pipe. 

He said to Patrolman Boleslaw, 
“What happened, Tad?” 

The other told him. 

The plainclothesman looked at 
Brothers closely and said, “I’m 
Detective Lieutenant Norman 
Schmidt. You got a permit for this 
pistol you used on the punk?” 
“Yes, sir.” 

"You don’t have to call me sir,” 
the detective replied. “You’re a 
citizen and, 1 assume, a taxpayer. I 
work for the city.” 

The smaller man nodded. “I’m a 
member of the City Auxiliary 
Police, acting patrolman when on 
duty. 1 was helping you that time 
you led the squad against the Dolly 
Teeter gang . sir.” 

The other pretended to remem- 
ber him now. “Oh, yeah,” he said. 
“Well, good work. Brothers. Tad, 
you and Jim take him down to 
headquarters and make out a rou- 
tine statement. Check his identity, 
so forth. Check out his gun per- 



mit.” He turned his eyes back to 
Brothers. “Nocrud, but technically 
you’re under arrest . .technically. 
You’ll sleep in your own bed to- 
night." 

“Thanks, sir. I suppose I’m a 
little upset. Uh, your men are cer- 
tainly efficient. 1 have to congratu- 
late you all. They were here in 
possibly half a minute after I acti- 
vated my emergency distress 
alarm.” 

T he next evening, before going 
onto his shift. Tad Boleslaw 
drifted into Lieutenant Schmidt’s 
office. They were moderately good 
friends, considering the difference 
in rank. Tad’s father and Schmidt 
had both been sergeants when the 
former had been killed in line of 
duty. The lieutenant knew that the 
younger man was bucking for the 
detective squad but didn’t have the 
seniority as yet. 

Schmidt had a marking stylo in 
his hand and was sourly checking 
out a report. He didn’t like tape- 
work and, God knew, there was 
enough of it these days. 

He said, “Cheers, Tad. What 
spins with you?” He ran a freckled 
hand back over his less than 
generously haired head. 

Tad pulled up one of the steel 
chairs of the drab police office, 
without invitation. 

He said, scowling a little, “I was 
wondering about that gunning last 
night.” 

The older man tossed his stylo to 



CRY WOLF 



9 




the desk, glad of the opportunity to 
scuttle it, and reached for his well 
soured pipe. “What gunning? 
There were four. Center City is 
getting to be like a shooting gallery. 
Oh, you mean the one you and Jim 
Kelly were in pn. What about it?” 

“I don’t know. It was something 
Brothers said. He said it wasn’t the 
first time he’d gone through this. 
He doesn’t exactly look the Wyatt 
Earp, Wild Bill Hickock type. But 
last night he evidently drew on that 
young funker while the kid was 
leveled down on him." 

Schmidt laughed, even as he 
loaded the briar. “This Charles 
Brothers I checked out, just as 
routine. In spite of his looks, he's 
an Asian War hero. Bronze Star. 
He’s seen a gun or so before.” 

Tad said, “All right, but for cris- 
sakes what’s he doing living in that 
neighborhood? And, if he does, 
what in the hell's he doing walking 
back and forth to work at night? 
Why doesn’t he drive or at least 
take public transportation? We’ve 
got a pretty good vacuum transport 
metro in this town these days. He 
could get to within a block of his 
house on it.” 

The lieutenant contemplated 
him, even as he lit his pipe. “What 
are you getting at. Tad?” 

“He said he’d been through it be- 
fore. How many times?” 

Schmidt said, “Like I say, I 
checked him out just as routine. 
He's one of the first citizens in 
Center City to buy an emergency 



alarm wrist device. And he was one 
of the first to use it. Two Blacks 
jumped him and he had it out with 
them. By the time the patrol boys 
got there, he had finished them off. 
We were looking for both of them, 
since they both had nice long 
records in the Crime Data Banks. 
One had a gun we were also looking 
for since a slug from it had chilled 
one of the citizens over in Far Cry. 
The other’s gun wasn't hot, so far 
as we know.” 

Tad said, "That was the first 
time. You mean that there were 
more?" 

“The next time, the man who 
tried to mug him didn’t have a 
crime dossier. Nothing at all. 
Brothers nailed him before the 
funker got a single shot off. That 
gyro-jet rocket pistol he carries 
needs exactly one hit to demolish 
King Kong or Moby Dick." 

“How was the mugger armed?" 

The lieutenant said, “With one 
of these bureau-draw er specials left 
over from the old days w'hen you 
could buy these foreign made war- 
surplus shooters for about fifteen 
dollars apiece. No record of the 
serial number, of course.” 

“They’re getting kind of scarce 
these days.” 

“What are you building up to?” 

“Damn if I know. How did that 
gun the kid had last night check 
out?” 

“Same thing. You can still pick 
them up in that slob neighborhood 
for a few pseudo-dollars. What in

GALAXY 




the hell’s roaching you, Tad?” The 
lieutenant had gotten his pipe 
going well. It stank. 

The patrolman said unhappily, 
“Walking home at night, in that 
neighborhood. It looks like he’s 
asking for it. His luck can’t last 
forever.” 

Schmidt shrugged lardy shoul- 
ders. “The guy's got guts. He’s not 
afraid of these punks. If more citi- 
zens were like him, had his cour- 
age, the muggers wouldn’t be on 
the streets. I told you, he's even got 
medals. You think a bunch of 
funkers looking for bread to buy 
their next fix are going to scare him 
off the streets of the city?” 

Tad said sourly, “They’re either 
going to or he’s going to wind up in 
the gutter himself one of these 
nights. He’s had more shoot-outs 
than most of the patrolmen on the 
force.” 

He came to his feet, preparatory 
to leaving but the lieutenant pulled 
out a drawer, reached in and came 
up with a gyro-jet rocket pistol. 

He said, “This is Brothers’ gun. 
All charges have been dropped 
against him, of course. When you 
and Jim Kelly get over that neigh- 
borhood, take it back to him.” 

Tad Boleslaw took the weapon 
and looked at it distastefully. “I 
don’t like these things,” he said. 
“Too much gun. You hit a man, 
just anywhere at all, and if he 
doesn’t go down you walk around 
behind him to see what’s holding 
him up. Suppose somebody’s 



running and you want to shoot him 
in the leg to stop him. You shoot 
him with one of these and it’d blow 
his leg off and he’d probably bleed 
to death before you could get 
medical help.” 

"Yeah,” Schmidt said around 
his pipe stem, “but you're a cop 
and sometimes the occasion comes 
up when you want to shoot some 
funker who’s running in the leg. 
But Brothers carries his shooter for 
self defense and when you’re de- 
fending your life the more punch 
you have on hand the better.” 

“I suppose so,” Tad said, still 
not happy. “See you later, Norm.” 

S ince Brothers had told them he 
worked the swing shift. Tad and 
Jim Kelly put off going to his home 
until about one in the morning. 

Even knowing the neighborhood, 
both of the patrolmen were sur- 
prised at the squalid, aged apart- 
ment house that the man lived in. 

The whole ward was a blot on the 
city and periodically the city fathers 
drew up plans to renovate it. 
Nothing seemed to come of them. 
Popularly, it was known as the last 
of the slums and the residents were 
aliens and others not eligible to 
collect the federal Guaranteed 
Annual Income, which was suffi- 
cient to enable the unemployed or 
pensioners to rent a small apart- 
ment in a decent high-rise apart- 
ment house, or even a place out in 
the suburbs. You didn’t live very 
high on the hog on GAI but you

lived adequately. One of the rea- 
sons for the high crime rate in this 
neighborhood was because so many 
of the residents were felons on the 
lam, military deserters, or others 
afraid to register for GA1 since they 
couldn’t reveal their correct 
identity. 

But it was unlikely that Charles 
Brothers would live here. 

They parked their helio-jet patrol 
vehicle before the building and 
both got out. They looked up at the 
aged structure; it must have been 
well over a century old. 

“Some joint,” Jim said. “Let’s 
go. 1 hate to leave our heap here. In 
this vicinity, somebody might steal 
it.” 

They went up the stone steps to 
the door. There was no identity 
screen. Instead, there were eight 
names and eight old fashioned 
electric buttons there. One of the 
name plates read Charles and Tilly 
Brothers. Apartment Six. Tad 
pressed the appropriate button and 
shortly the door buzzed. Jim 
opened it and they went into a 
dimly lit hall. There was no ele- 
vator. They started up the stairs. 

Apartment Six was on the third 
floor. Evidently, there were two 
flats per floor. Jim knocked at the 
door. 

There was a peephole set into it 
and the two patrolmen could detect 
an eye taking them in. 

The door opened and Charles 
Brothers was there in shirtsleeves, 
pants and slippers. 



He said, “Yes? What can I do for 
you?" 

Tad said, "The lieutenant sent 
us over to return your gun, Mr. 
Brothers. All charges against you 
have been dropped." 

“Why. come on in boys.” 

They followed him into a living 
room. In actuality, once inside the 
apartment it wasn’t badly done at 
all. It was very well, very tastefully, 
furnished and there were paintings 
on the walls that were obviously 
originals. 

A girl got up from the couch 
where she had been, of all things, 
knitting. Whoever heard of women 
knitting in this age? She looked at 
them nervously. 

She was not an unattractive 
young woman. About twenty-five, 
Tad would say. Nice brown hair 
worn rather long as styles went 
these days, pleasant figure just a 
very little on the dumpy side and, 
like Charles Brothers himself, she 
wore glasses. If anything, they 
rather enchanced her blue eyes. 
Her clothes were a good twenty 
years out of date. 

Brothers said, “Gentlemen, this 
is my daughter, Tilly. Tilly, these 
officers came to my rescue last 
night." He added apologetically, “I 
don’t believe I got your names.” 

Tad grinned at her, his cap al- 
ready in hand, and said, “He didn’t 
need to be rescued. I'm Patrolman 
Tadeusz Boleslaw and this is 
Patrolman James Kelly.” 

Brothers looked at him and said.

GALAXY 




“Are you a foreigner?” 

Tad frowned and said, “Why, 
no. My father was of Polish descent 
and my mother German but they 
were both second generation 
Americans. Why?” 

Brothers said uncomfortably, “I 
don’t like foreigners. I’d offer you 
boys a drink but I no longer use the 
stuff myself. It cuts down your re- 
flexes. For that matter, 1 don’t hold 
'with keeping it in the house." 

Kelly said, “We can’t drink on 
duty anyway.” 

And Tilly said in a small, dis- 
tinct, sweet voice, “Coffee, per- 
haps?" 

Tad smiled at her. “Afraid we 
don’t have the time, Ms. Brothers. 
We'll take a rain check.” He 
looked at her father, preparatory to 
leaving. He had already handed 
over the gyro- jet pistol. He said, 
"Hope you don’t have to use that 
again, sir.” 

“1 trust I won’t, but 1 like to be 
prepared. These gook slum ele- 
ments have to be kept down.” 

Jim said, “1 hope you didn’t walk 
home tonight through this neigh- 
borhood.” 

“Why, yes, of course 1 did,” the 
other told him, a touch of indigna- 
tion in his voice. “I do every night. 
I have a sedentary job and need the 
exercise.” 

“Unarmed?” 

The small man shook his head, 
as though smug. “No. 1 had 
another gun. 1 collect guns.” 

Tad nodded, as though that 



figured and said, “Well, good- 
night. Nice to have met you, Ms. 
Brothers.” 

On the way down the steps. Tad 
muttered, “That’s a funny set-up 
there." 

Kelly looked at him from the side 
of his eyes. "How do you mean?” 

“1 don’t know.” 

Back on their patrol over the 
city, Tad said, “Did you notice that 
the girl wore an emergency wrist 
alarm too?” 

“Why not? I wish the hell every 
citizen did,” Jim told him. “Biggest 
thing to hinder crime we’ve ever 
had. The Federal Enforcement 
Assistance Administration came up 
with the first primitive one way 
back in the 1970s. But they’re 
really efficient now. A citizen is 
confronted with an emergency and 
activates his wrist alarm. The com- 
puters, within less than a second, 
get a cross on his location and 
beam a message to the nearest 
patrol vehicles both surface and 
air. Wizard! We’re on the scene, 
often in less than a minute. How 
can you beat it? Burglaries, for in- 
stance, have just about disappear- 
ed. And rape? Any girl with a wrist 
alarm is as safe as in her mother’s 
arms.” 

“I guess you’re right,” Tad said. 
“Everybody ought to wear one, es- 
pecially if they’re often in situations 
open to violence.” 

Jim was suddenly scowling. “You 
know,” he said, “it just came to 
me, talking about wrist emergency 



CRY WOLF 



13 




alarms. Brothers wasn’t wearing 
one last night.” 

“What’re you talking about? 
How could he have sent in that 
emergency call, if he didn’t have an 
alarm?” 

“I'm not saying he didn’t have 
one. I’m just saying he wasn’t 
wearing one on his wrist. 
Remember when I frisked him? I 
ran my hands up his forearms. I 
always do, to check for knives or 
little hide-out pistols. He wasn’t 
wearing anything on his wrists, 
even a watch.” 

“He probably had it in a 
pocket,” Ted said. 

“Why? They make those alarms 
as big as they are so that potential 
stick-up men or muggers, or what- 
ever, can see them and be scared 
off. There’s not much point in 
hiding your wrist alarm.” 

They flew in silence for a time 
until Tad said, “What got me was 
the uncomfortable atmosphere. 
The girl seemed afraid.” 

Jim looked over at him 
quizzically. “Afraid of what? Not a 
couple of cops. Hell, her father’s a 
cop himself, in a way. Volunteer in 
the City Auxiliary Police. From 
what he told Lieutenant Schmidt, 
he evidently was in that shoot-out 
with Dolly Teeter’s mob.” 

“I don’t mean immediately 
afraid,” Tad said slowly. “I mean a 
long time afraid. There was a feel- 
ing of fear in that apartment.” 
“Jesus,” Jim said. “You going 
mystical on me?” 



T he following day was one of 
Tad’s free days. He was a fitful 
sleeper, especially when working a 
late shift. But his sleeping the night 
before — mostly in the early morn- 
ing hours had been worse than 
usual. He'd slept about three hours 
and had then come awake and 
spent the next four or five in that 
half-sleep in which you usually 
worry about something or other. 

He couldn't get Charles Brothers 
off his mind. The whole thing 
didn’t ring true. Okay, what Norm 
Schmidt had said was believable. 
The guy was a war hero who had 
won medals and wasn’t about to 
truckle to a bunch of cheap hoods. 
He went armed and provided with a 
police emergency wrist alarm and 
he was ready and able to take on 
anybody who gave him trouble. But 
something still didn’t quite ring 
true. In all. Brothers had killed 
four of these young funkers. Four! 
He hadn’t simply wounded a single 
one. All were dead by the time the 
police got to the scene. Of course, 
using a gyro-jet pistol would ac- 
count for that. But still. Four. In 
all of his police years, Tad Boleslaw 
had killed exactly one man. And he 
was sorry about that. He should 
have been able to bring the other 
down without killing him. A 
prowler had run up an alley with 
Tad in full pursuit. It proved to be 
a dead end. The man turned and 
pulled a gun. Tad had tried to wing 
him but he had shot too hurriedly, 
fearing that the other would shoot

first. He had got him in the belly. 
The ambulance, for once, had 
taken hell’s own time to get to the 
scene. Everything went wrong. The 
poor bastard was DOA at the 
hospital. 

Of course. Tad had nicked 
several others in his time, some of 
them pretty badly, but he had only 
killed one. But four, for crissakes, 
and the man wasn’t even a real cop. 

Since he was a bachelor and im- 
patient of larger quarters, Tad 
lived in a mini-apartment in a 
moderately sized high-rise apart- 
ment house. There were some five 
hundred apartments in the build- 
ing and he doubted if he knew half 
a dozen of the people who were 
supposedly his neighbors. It suited 
him, and his way of life, but he 
knew that this existence was rapidly 
becoming unpopular with most. 
Too ant-like. 

The big cities were breaking up 
and the inhabitants, lemming-like, 
were streaking out into the boon- 
docks, some to small communities, 
some to even more isolated exis- 
tence, or mobile towns. People’s 
Capitalism, as some called it, 
allowed for not only Guaranteed 
Annual Income, but also provided 
each family in the land one free 
residence, or mobile home. In 
actuality, you could apply for 
yours, get it — there was a certain 
maximum amount of pseudo- 
dollars you were allowed to ex- 
pend — and then sell it the very next 
day, if you wished. But from then 



on you either had to buy another 
place on your own, or rent. There 
was a certain method in the seem- 
ing madness. It was a way of coun- 
ter-balancing the fall off economi- 
cally when so much of the military 
spending had been discontinued. 
The billions formerly expended on 
so-called defense were put into con- 
struction and into other fields, such 
as ecology and the rebuilding of the 
environment. 

All for the best, he assumed, 
although Tad Boleslaw was 
precious little interested in such 
subjects as socio-economics. He 
was a dedicated cop and a good 
one. He found it a satisfactory 
manner of making a living, though 
unromantic, usually drab and 
laborious. He had a moderately 
good education and had also had 
two tours at the FBI school. He 
studied every issue of such 
technical publications as Criminol- 
ogy, Police Science and the Journal 
of Criminal Law. He had a dis- 
tinguished marksman rating, and 
two citations on his record. After 
training, he had moved up from 
probation through the two patrol- 
man grades and had his fingers 
crossed about getting detective 
status in the reasonably near 
future. 

He finally gave up any hopes of 
further sleep, got up and flicked 
the button which slid his bed into 
the wall where it would be made-up 
with fresh bedclothes. Thank the 
powers that were for automated 



CRY WOLF

housekeeping. 

He went through his usual morn- 
ing bathroom routine then went 
into the so-called kitchenette, sat 
down at the small table and dialed 
breakfast from the automated 
kitchens in tHe basement. And 
thank the gods for them, too. Tad 
was of the tribe that couldn’t even 
make a decent pot of coffee. 

He was so preoccupied that he 
didn’t taste his food, and was 
mildly surprised to find the meal 
was over. He threw the dishes and 
utensils into the disposal and 
turned back into the livingroom- 
cum-bedroom-cum-study. 

He went over to his desk and 
dialed the National Data Banks on 
his screen. 

He said verbally, rather than 
dialing for his information, “I want 
the dossier of Charles Brothers.” 
He opened his police notebook and 
flicked to the page he had used the 
night before and read off the identi- 
fication code of his subject. 

The screen said, “What is your 
classification, please? Are you 
eligible to request a citizen’s 
dossier?” 

“Police officer,” he said, and put 
his identification card on the ap- 
propriate square of the screen. 

And there was the life of Charles 
Brothers. Very cold was a citizen’s 
dossier, very sterile. But all the in- 
formation was there. Had Tad been 
interested, grandparents, parents, 
date of birth, doctor presiding at 
birth, etc. etc. Health from his 



earliest years, every time he had 
medical attention, every childhood 
disease from the first months, every 
other visit to a doctor, up to and 
through any venereal disease he 
might have picked up in Asia 
during the war, etc., etc. 

Brothers had a high-school edu- 
cation as they had called it in those 
days. Evidently, average student. 
As a matter of fact he seemed aver- 
age all ways from Tuesday. Tad got 
to the war years. His subject had 
been drafted and had seemingly 
been a good soldier, rising to the 
rank of sergeant. Four years in the 
infantry. Which would seem to 
have been plenty. 

And then Tad Boleslaw came to 
his first discrepancy. The other’s 
military discharge status was 
blank. 

Strange. He flicked a switch and 
said, “What type of discharge was 
Charles Brothers given?” He re- 
peated the other’s identification 
code. 

The screen said, “That informa- 
tion is restricted.” 

Tad blinked. “Why?” 

“That information is also re- 
stricted.” 

He’d be damned. He went on 
with the dossier. Following the war, 
Brothers had taken training in 
operating IBM machines. He had 
seemingly been good at it and got 
promotions. He was currently being 
paid three hundred pseudo-dollars 
a week as a shift supervisor in an 
installation in an ultra-market. 



16 



GALAXY 




Three hundred pseudo-dollars a 
week! And living in a dump like 
that? Well, not really a dump. The 
apartment was pleasant enough. 
But in that cheap ghetto? That 
slum? 

He went on. Married. Divorced a 
couple of years ago. One child. 
Tilly. 

Yes. Tilly. The scared girl. 
Scared of what? 

He ran into his second surprise. 
Organizations to which the other 
belonged. Brothers had applied to 
join the National Guard. Applica- 
tion refused. Reason restricted. 

Application refused! To a war 
hero? 

He sunk back into his chair for a 
moment, then flicked his switch 
again and said, “What classifica- 
tion is needed to receive the infor- 
mation about Charles Brothers’ 
military discharge and his applica- 
tion refusal to join the National 
Guard?” 

“A Military Classification One." 

One! Jesus Christ, you practi- 
cally had to be a member of the 
Chiefs of Staff or the President 
himself. One! Who in the hell was 
this Brothers? 

He had largely skim-read but 
now he had come to the end of the 
dossier. He leaned back in his chair 
and stared at the screen for a time. 

Then he said, “I want the Crime 
Dossier of Charles Brothers.” 

“What is your classification, 
please? Are you eligible to read a 
citizen’s Crime Dossier?”

Just back from the World Science 
Fiction Convention where, as we pre- 
dicted, RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA 
won the Hugo. We instantly cabled our 
congratulations to Arthur C. Clarke at 
his home in Sri Lanka |new name for 
Ceylon], and he cabled back, 
“Splendid news . , should boost me 
on final 20,000 stretch just began ■ . 
thanks and love to all!” So a new 
Clarke novel is on the horizon . and 
we’ll tell you more as soon as we see the 
manuscript. 

RAMA first saw print in the United 
States as a serial in Galaxy, thanks In 
large part to Clarke’s agent Scott 
Meredith, who was a devoted sf fan 
long before becoming literary agent for 
many of the world’s top writers. While 
still an editor at Galaxy, we suggested 
to Meredith that it was high time 
Clarke had a novel serialized in one of 
the magazines, since that was where 
his first sf was published. Meredith 
agreed and promised to send the next 
Clarke novel to Galaxy providing Play- 
boy [the best-paying market in the 
field], could not take it on. True to his 
word, Meredith sold RAMA to Galaxy. 
Then we brought the galleys of the 
novel with us to Ballantine, and the 
rest is publishing history. Much has 
been said and written about 
agents — and not all of it complimen- 
tary. So, let us go on record in appre- 
ciation of the unsung middlemen in the 
field.

When we presented THE BEST OF 
STANLEY G. WEINBAUM at the 
sales conference last year, we were 
greeted with a chorus of “What's a 
Weinbaum?” Readers knew who 
Weinbaum was, and lots of books were 
sold. This year we offer THE BEST OF 
FRITZ LEIBER, and all the salesmen 
approved that choice. This second 
volume in our classic library of defini- 
tive sf collections by the giants of the 
field was a selection of the Science Fic- 
tion Book Club. The 22 stories, 
specially chosen by Leiber himself, are 
Introduced by Poul Anderson. Even at 
its price of $1 .75 [you would not believe 
what paper costs!], this collection is a 
super buy. Any serious reader of 
science fiction will, no doubt, want the 
entire series.

He went through that routine 
again. 

And there was the Crime 
Dossier. 

There was precious little that 
Tad Boleslaw' didn’t already know, 
aside from a couple of traffic viola- 
tions before the war and one drunk 
and disorderly charge back when 
the other had been eighteen. He 
came to the subject’s military years. 
awol once for two days. Another 
minor offense; while going through 
training he had refused to obey an 
order of one of his non-coms. Tad 
didn’t bother to read the details. 

He then came to another sur- 
prise. There was a lot of militarized 
numbers, references and general 
gobblydygook — then a stamp; “In- 
formation Restricted.” 

Again he slumped in surprise for 
a moment, then checked Brothers’ 
post-war Crime Dossier. 

Nil except for the three shoot- 
ings. The first two had been 
Blacks, as Tad had already knowm. 
Same family; they were brothers, 
Wilbur and Washington Scott, 18 
and 20 years respectively. Both with 
lengthy crime records. The second, 
Jesus Martinez, a Cuban of 18 
years, had no particular record. 
Schmidt had already told him that. 
The third shooting, that of last 
night, was of Jose Gonzales, a 
Mexican. 

And that was the crime career, 
such as it was, of Charles Brothers. 

Tad thought about it awhile and 
then requested the Crime Dossier 



18 



GALAXY 




of Jose Gonzales. Though of Mexi- 
can background, he had been born 
in Arizona. His record was sparse. 
As a twelve-year old he had been 
picked up by the juvenile authori- 
ties for pilfering candy in an ultra- 
market. He had been properly 
scolded and released. He had been 
picked up again at fifteen for loiter- 
ing, evidently in the companionship 
of some less savory Mexican 
youths. About a year ago he had 
been arrested while riding in a 
stolen car. It turned out that he 
hadn’t known it was stolen. The 
driver, who had given him a ride, 
had ripped off the vehicle. Jose was 
turned loose. And that was all, no 
more crime record. 

Tad slumped back again. 

The boy that Brothers had shot 
the night before had, for all practi- 
cal purposes, no criminal record at 
all. Tad’s probably was worse. Al- 
though, now that he thought of it, 
he had never looked up his own 
dossier. He probably had a few 
traffic violations, or some such, to 
his credit. Oh yes, and that time 
when he was in college and they 
had the peace demonstration. He 
had been arrested along with a 
score of other students, and re- 
leased when the Civil Liberties 
Union hit the fan. 

He turned off his screen and 
thought a while, then turned it 
back on and asked for the Military 
Dossier on Charles Brothers. 

It would seem that he had been a 
war hero. Besides his Bronze Star, 



a combat medal not easily ac- 
quired, he had several Battle Stars, 
a few campaign ribbons — but any- 
body could get those — and three 
Purple Hearts. In other words, the 
innocuous appearing Buddy Broth- 
ers. as Jim Kelly had called him, 
had been hit by enemy fire three 
times. 

The last item was what stopped 
him. It was practically a dupli- 
cation of the restricted information 
in the general dossier he had first 
read. Something had happened. 
Tad hadn’t the slightest clue as to 
what. A court martial, perhaps? 
The report didn’t even give that. 

Charles Brothers was discharged. 
Period. Honorably? Dishonorably? 
For being a homosexual? Or what? 
The information simply wasn’t 
there. 

Suddenly, he became irritated 
with himself. This was a hell of a 
way to spend one of his days off. He 
and Jim Kelly worked a full 
four-day week. Why should he de- 
vote his own time to worrying about 
something that was really none of 
his concern? Charles Brothers had 
been exonerated. To hear Norm 
Schmidt talk, the bemedaled 
veteran should get another medal 
for knocking off undesirable juve- 
nile delinquents. Maybe he was 
right. God knows, there were 
enough of them these days. What 
with automation and computeriza- 
tion of industry, it was practically 
impossible to get a job any more 
and the streets were overflowing

with kids, some of whom seemed to 
feel that they had a mandate to 
prey on their elders. 

He flicked off his screen and 
came to his feet, yawning. He de- 
cided to go downtown to the Mall 
and see if anything was stirring. He 
could have ealleci one of his femi- 
nine friends but he didn’t really feel 
like it. He was in an unhappy frame 
of mind. 

Instead of summoning an auto- 
mated cab from the autopool on the 
third basement level, he went on 
down to the metro and took the 
vacuum tube into town. There were 
too many vehicles around as it was, 
even though they weren’t allowed 
on street level. 

In the Mall he sauntered about. 
When he had been a youngster, 
there had been a good many small 
shops here. But that was yester- 
year. With the coming of the ultra- 
market, the small shop had begun 
to wither away. You could order 
anything, but anything, in your 
own home and have it delivered 
there into your delivery box by 
chute almost instantly. Why spend 
time shopping? 

The Mall these days, aside from 
being a charming area for loafing 
away on a bench, or strolling about 
amongst begging pigeons, watching 
the girls go by, and such, boasted 
various bars and restaurants, 
usually highly specialized; Chinese, 
Italian, French, Mexican. You 
could, of course, have ordered any 
of the dishes in the privacy of your 



own home, but some citizens liked 
the congenial atmosphere of a well- 
done restaurant. There were also 
art galleries, theatres for live 
shows, nightclubs and various 
other public establishments purvey- 
ing items or entertainment not 
practical for home-use. 

He stopped for a few minutes 
and stared into the window of an 
art gallery. Evidently, a one-man 
show was going on inside. He peer- 
ed down at the name of the artist. 
Sam Rhinedorf. Tad had never 
heard of him. His style seemed to 
be a return to the Impressionists. 

There was someone standing 
next to him. 

He looked over and said, “Why, 
it’s Ms. Brothers. Good after- 
noon.” 

She blinked her blue eyes 
through the slightly pink tinted 
lenses of her glasses. She was pe- 
tite, he realized now — size eight at 
a guess. And she looked even nicer 
than she had the night before, 
though she wore no cosmetics and 
her clothes were once again years 
out of date. Not that Tad Boleslaw 
was any fanatic about women’s

She said, in her small voice, 
“Why, it’s Mr.—” 

“Boleslaw,” he reminded her, 
smiling. “My partner and I re- 
turned your father's gun last night. 
Tad Boleslaw.” 

“Yes, of course,” she said, and 
then looked up and down the street 
as though seeking some reason for

departure. 

But Tad wasn’t having any. 
There was an elfin something about 
this girl that attracted him. And 
there was also a . well, he 
couldn’t quite put his finger upon 
it. A mystery of some sort' or other. 

He said. “It's one of my days off. 
I’m killing time. The Hole is just up 
the street, would you join me?” 

“The Hole?" 

He laughed. “Sam’s Bar. Really, 
a very nice place. Sam owns the 
only unautomated bar in town and 
serves the best dark beer I’ve ever 
tasted. He has everything else, too, 
of course.” 

“Oh, Father doesn't permit me 
to drink.” 

He studied her quizzically for a 
moment, his head tilted to one side. 
He guessed her age at twenty-five or 
so. 

He said, “For that matter, Sam 
carries soft drinks. You could have 
a Del Valle or something while I 
had my beer, and we could find out 
a little about each other.” 

“What did you want to find out 
about me, Mr. Boleslaw?” she 
asked, her voice wavering just a bit. 

He stared at her. “Why, nothing. 
1 meant, I just thought we could 
chat a little.” 

“I’m afraid my father wouldn’t 
approve of my entering a place 
where they served hard drink.” 

He was exasperated and said, 
“Well, then, we’ll go somewhere 
where they serve only soft drinks 
and we'll both have a Del Valle." 



She said, and was there a distant 
regret there? “I don’t think my 
father would approve of me 
associating with a man to whom I 
haven’t been properly introduced. 
Forgive me — and thank you. Good 
afternoon. Mr. Boleslaw.” She 
turned and hurried away. 

He gazed after her. Her long 
brown hair bounced charmingly on 
her shoulders and the very faint 
sway of her buttocks gave promise 
of a fascinating figure underneath 
those antiquated clothes. 

“Properly introduced, for 
Christ’s sake?” he muttered. “I 
was introduced to you last night, in 
your own home by your own father. 
How proper can an introduction 
get?” 

In disgust, though why he should 
be bothered he couldn’t say, he 
went on up the way to The Hole and 
took a stool at the bar. He liked the 
place. It was his favorite bar. Sam 
had made every effort to recreate 
the atmosphere that prevailed a 
century ago, before the first of the 
World Wars. It was pleasantly dim, 
pleasantly cool though without the 
artificial cold of air conditioning. 

Sam came down and without a 
word drew a dark beer. 

Tad said, “Sam, how old do you 
figure a girl should be before she’s 
allowed to drink, enter bars and 
associate with any men she damn 
well pleases? And, come to think of 
it, choose her own clothes and her 
own hair-do and wear make-up if 
she wants to?”

Sam slid the stein over. He was a 
stereotype bartender of the old 
school, beefy, with large reddish 
hands, and came complete with 
white apron. 

He said, “Why, I don’t know, 
Mr. Boleslaw. About eighteen?” 

“Would you believe twenty- 
five?” 

Sam obviously didn’t know what 
he was talking about. 



I ife was routine. Each patrol was 
j about the same. An indecent 
exposure complaint over in Madi- 
son Park; an attempted rape of a 
fourteen-year old; an occasional 
mugging; a salesman reporting his 
hotel room cleaned out, samples 
and all. One night they picked up a 
child of eighteen months and 
rushed it to the hospital; it had 
been beaten unconscious by a 
drunken father. They picked up a 
pervert in Jefferson Park who was 
molesting boys, or trying to. He was 
an old customer. Jim called him 
“sweetie.” 

It was two weeks later that Jim 
Kelly told him idly, as they were 
about to take off for the night’s 
patrol, "Did you hear? Brothers 
did it again.” 

Tad looked over at his partner, 
not getting it at first. “What the 
hell are you talking about?” 

Jim snorted and said, “Buddy 
Brothers. He was jumped again. 
Two of them this time. Chilled 
them both. 1 tell you, that man’s a 



one man vigilante group.” 

Tad stared at him. “You have to 
be drivel-happy. When? Why 
weren’t we called in?” 

“Didn’t happen in our patrol 
area. Just outside it. Mike and 
Luke were first on the scene. 
Couple of wop kids. One had a 
gun, the other a knife.” 

“That makes six,” Tad mutter- 
ed. “How can a man in a well 
policed, civilized town have to kill 
six kids — were they kids?” 

“Yeah,” Jim said. “One about 
sixteen, one eighteen. Good 
riddance.” 

Tad sucked in breath. “At the 
rate he’s going, he’ll finish off every 
juvenile delinquent in town — if they 
are juvenile delinquents.” 

Jim looked at him from the side 
of his eyes. He said harshly, “What 
are you talking about? They tried 
to stick him up.” 

Tad said emptily, "The first two 
he killed had criminal records. The 
second two didn’t.” 

Jim was disgusted. “They were 
just beating the rap. They hadn’t 
taken a fall yet for any of their 
romps. They were both armed, 
weren’t they?” 

Tad didn’t answer directly. He 
said, his voice musing, “I wonder 
how much of a Crime Dossier these 
latest two had.” 

He stewed about it. When the 
patrol was over he decided to go 
and see Norm Schmidt, but the 
lieutenant was out on an attempted 
armed robbery romp.

H e went on home and to bed 
and stewed some more. After a 
couple of hours, he got up and went 
over to his desk and activated his 
screen. It took him fifteen minutes 
to get the information he was seek- 
ing from the National Data Banks. 
Buddy Brothers had had his shoot- 
out with the two Blacks tw'o years 
ago. He’d had his second attack, 
the one with the Puerto Rican kid a 
year later. And the Mexican boy 
that Tad and Jim had been in on, 
came six months after that. This 
shooting of the two Italians came 
only two weeks after, give or take a 
day or two. 

“It’s accelerating.” he growled. 
Then something else came to 
him. The first two were Blacks, the 
third was a Puerto Rican, the 
fourth a Mexican, the next two 
Italians. 

What had Brothers said, when 
Tad had given him his name? “Are 
you a foreigner?" 

A foreigner, for Christ’s sake? 
Wasn’t everybody in America a 
foreigner, except the Indians? 

He went back to bed and stewed 
some more. 

He got damn precious little 
sleep — if any. At best, he drowsed. 

When he finally surrendered and 
got up. he went, still in his pajama 
tops — he never wore the bottoms — 
directly to his desk screen. Then he 
thought better of it and walked on 
into his bath and used his face 
depilatory. Then he donned his 
dress uniform, which was swank

enough to suggest he had more 
rank than he actually carried. 

He didn’t take time for break- 
fast. He sat down before his screen 
and began. He wound up with 
Colonel Mathers, of the Local 
National Guard- 

He identified himself and said, 
“Colonel Mathers, I’m checking up 
on some matters pertaining to 
Charles Brothers.” He read off the 
identification number. It evidently 
wasn’t necessary. The colonel 
recognized the name. 

"What can I do for you?” 
“Some years ago, Mr. Brothers 
attempted to join the National 
Guard. With his background, isn’t 
such a man usually offered at least 
a lieutenant’s commission?” 

“Yes.” 

“But he was rejected.” 

“Yes.” 

“But, why?” 

“That information is restricted.” 
“I am a police officer, Colonel.” 
“So you have already informed 
me.” The screen blanked. 

“Wow,” Tad said. He slumped 
in his chair. It came to him that he 
was continually slumping every 
time he came up against the Buddy 
Brothers matter. 

He thought about it. 

Was there any use attempting to 
get in touch with the Octagon, in 
Greater Washington? 

He doubted it. 

And he began to have some other 
doubts. He suspected that if he 
prowled about much more that 



sooner or later somebody was going 
to land on him and shut him up. He 
could be shut up easily — if he 
didn't want to lose his job. And 
only a small percentage of the 
population had jobs any more, 
what with computerization and 
automation. Automation, hell, 
ultra-malion they were calling it 
these days. You didn’t need people 
any more on the job. Most people 
lived on their minimal Guaranteed 
Annual Income. So far as Tadeusz 
Boleslaw was concerned, the hell 
with that. 

However, he was a cop, and a 
dedicated cop. 

It was late in the day by the 
standards of the average man, but 
early for him. However, he got up 
and went over to his mini- 
sized autobar and dialed himself a 
Polish Zubrowka vodka. The world 
might think that Russian vodka 
was the best, but any Pole knew 
better. This came with a sprig of 
herb in it that gave it a special 
flavor. Buffalo brand, it would be 
translated into English. Bison 
brand was more accurate and there 
was a Bison on the label of the 
bottle. 

He took it back with him to the 
desk screen and stared a long time, 
without activating it. Then he 
knocked the drink back and got to 
his dialing again. 

From the National Data Banks 
he checked back on the military 
career of Charles Brothers. His 
division, his regiment, finally down 



24 



GALAXY 




to his company and then squad. 

He winced when he went over the 
record of Brothers’ company. Over 
the four years that Buddy Brothers 
had been with them, they had 
taken something like two hundred 
percent casualties. Two hundred 
percent! How had Brothers lived 
through four years with no more 
than three wounds? At the end of 
four years, there must not have 
been a dozen men who had gone 
through the whole thing, as Buddy 
Brothers had done. Four years of 
taking casualties. A death here, a 
minor hit there, a wound the other 
place that took you out of combat 
for all time — and probably you 
blessed the fate that did it. 

But two hundred percent casual- 
ties! There just wasn’t such a thing 
in military statistics for that short a 
period. That meant nobody was left 
alive, twice over. And over and over 
the new replacement kids coming 
in, most of them, green as they 
were, going down the first week or 
so. The veterans, such as Buddy 
Brothers, after a year or so in com- 
bat had at least some chance of sur- 
viving. At least they knew all the 
ropes. 

Two hundred percent casualties! 
In four years? They must have used 
that regiment as shock troops, 
expendables. 

His efforts became routine now. 
And it took him two hours to find 
what he wanted, a veteran of 
Charles Brothers’ own outfit who 
lived in Center City. Had he failed. 



he would have picked the nearest 
other big city and started off all 
over again. But he found what he 
was looking for. John Cardin, once 
a corporal in Brothers’ company. 

Tad noted down the man’s ad- 
dress; it was out in one of the 
suburbs. He got his cap and headed 
for the car pool where he rented a 
Volkshover. 

The Cardin home was a single 
family house, middle class, neat 
and with a few children’s toys on 
the lawn. 

The identity screen on the door 
picked him up and shortly the door 
opened and a middle-aged woman 
in an apron was there. She was a 
placid looking type, obviously busy 
at her housework and surprised to 
have a police officer confronting 
her. 

She said, “Good heavens, what is 
it? Nothing’s happened to — ?” 

He held up a hand and smiled. 
"Nothing has happened to anyone, 
Mrs. Cardin. 1 simply have a few 
questions to ask your husband.” 
“What has he done?” she said in 
alarm. 

He held his smile, trying to make 
it reassuring. “He hasn’t done any- 
thing. It's not about him. It's about 
someone he used to know.” 

She was relieved. “Oh, well, 
John isn’t here now, but he should 
be home from work at any time.” 
“Could I wait?” 

"Why, certainly.” 

She led him to the small living 
room and saw him seated. 



CRY WOLF

“Could I get you a drink? John 
usually has a bottle of something or 
other in the kitchen cabinet.” 

"Thanks, no. Not while in uni- 
form." 

She left him and he waited for 
possibly fifteen minutes until her 
husband entered. 

The man was somewhere in his 
mid-fifties, which fitted in with the 
fact that he had served in the Asian 
War, and his face was wrinkled be- 
yond his years. It wasn’t a happy 
face, no laugh wrinkles, but lots of 
weariness. He was scowling. 

He said in puzzlement, “You 
wanted to see me? About what?” 

fad stood and held out his hand 
for a shake, in the way of reassur- 
ance, and said, “I’m Patrolman 
Boleshaw, Mr. Cardin. 1 wanted to 
ask you sonic questions about 
Charles Brothers.” 

The other shook hands, still 
frowning. He said, “Never heard of 
him." 

"It was a long time ago. During 
the war. Sergeant Charles Brothers. 
Possibly you knew him as Buddy 
Brothers.” 

“Oh, Buddy. Sure. Sit down, 
Officer. Whatever happened to 
him?" 

"He lives right here in Center 
City.” Tad reseated himself. 

"I’ll be damned. I never knew 
that. What did you want to know 
about Buddy?” Tad's host seated 
himself as w ell, and leaned forward 
in his chair, elbows on the arm- 
rests. 



Tad said carefully, "It’s about 
that trouble in the Asian War.” 

“Good God,” the other said in 
disgust, “are they raking that up 
again?” 

“Well, in a way,” Tad said care- 
fully. 

The other was more than un- 
happy. He said musingly, “If 
they’re after him, they’d be after 
me too." 

Tad shook his head reassuringly. 
"Don’t worry about it, Mr. Cardin. 
You were exonerated, weren’t 
you?” He hoped he was asking 
questions that wouldn’t alarm the 
other. 

"Yeah, sure, we all were. The 
whole thing was hushed up. The 
orders came right from the top. I 
don’t know why in the hell they’re 
digging it up at this late date. It 
happened over twenty years ago.” 

Tad nodded and said, pulling his 
notebook from his pocket and 
bringing out a pencil. “Suppose 
you tell me about it, briefly.” 

Cardin said, “Well, no reason 
why not. It’s all in the records 
though. Why do you need it?” 

"I’m afraid I can't tell you. 
Orders.” 

“Okay, then. We were down in 
the Delta, see, and we’d been 
taking a lot of hits. One hell of a lot 
of casualties and we were all up- 
tight. We’d been in the line for 
three weeks and that Delta was no 
joke. Anyway, there was this town 
called Soc Trang. Little dump, 
couple of hundred people. The lieu-

tenant, he figured that was where 
some of the sniper fire was coming 
from. And we went in. I don’t know 
what happened. Something just 
kind of snapped.” 

He paused and wiped his mouth 
with the back of his hand, ob- 
viously distressed at the memory. 
“Go on,” Tad said soothingly. 
“Well, Buddy Brothers was kind 
of the ring leader, you might call it. 
He always was a fiesty little 
bastard. We didn’t find any snipers 
or even any military age men at all. 
We rounded up the women and 
kids and put 'em all in the school 
house and then we rounded up the 
men, they were all old, and wasted 
them.” 

Tad looked up, trying to avoid 
gaping at the other. Supposedly, he 
already knew about the incident. 
He said, “You shot them all?” 
“Yeah. That’s what I just said.” 
The other moistened his lips. 
“We'd gone drivel-happy, see. We 
were all acting like crazies. I don’t 
know who it was got the idea of 
burning down the school. Maybe 
several of us at once.” 

“I see," Tad said. “I don’t be- 
lieve I’ve ever heard of Soc Trang.” 
“Nothing ever came out. The 
army was having a lot of heat those 
days about several other — massa- 
cres, they called them. And there 
was a howl going up in the States, 
the newspapers and all. So the 
Brass didn’t want any more to get 
out so they put the lid on Soc 
Trang. The lieutenant and Buddy 



Brothers and a couple of other 
guys, they were considered the 
leaders and they were bounced out 
of the service with some kind of 
special discharge handed down all 
the way from the general.” 

“I see,” Tad said. He returned 
the notebook to his pocket. “You 
think this might have had any long 
term effect on Brothers?” 

The other shrugged hugely. “I 
don’t know. I’ve never seen him 
again. But you see, he’d been in it 
for years. I only was in for six 
months before l took a hit. He got 
to the point where he liked the 
killing. Buddy never took no 
prisoners. He shot ’em. Sometimes, 
if you had a prisoner he’d take him 
off aways and waste him, too, even 
after the officers had told you to 
pick up a few of them for question- 
ing, He hated gooks, and he called 
just about anybody a gook that 
wasn’t what he was. He even didn’t 
like the niggers in our own outfit.” 
“I see," Tad said. He stood and 
said, “Well, thank you very much, 
Mr. Cardin. You’ve been very co- 
operative. I hate to have brought 
this all up again for you — after all 
these years.” 

The other looked at him, sick- 
ness behind his eyes. “Nothing at 
all.” 

“And please thank Ms. Cardin 
for me.” Tad headed for the door. 

W hen Tad Boleslaw walked in- 
to the office of Norman 
Schmidt, the lieutenant looked up.

He said, "Cheers, Tad. What 
spins? What’re you doing in uni- 
form? 1 thought this was one of 
your days off.” 

Tad nodded and sat down. “It 
is.” he said. "But there was some- 
thing I wanted to check out. Norm, 
Charles Brothers is a psycho.” 
“What in the hell are you talking 
about?” The older man reached for 
his stubby briar, scowling. He 
pulled a pound tin of pipe tobacco 
toward him, flicked the lid off it 
and began to load up. 

Tad said, “I’ve been talking to a 
war buddy of his. He said that 
Brothers saw so much action that 
he finally liked to kill. He'd shoot 
prisoners and so forth. Then one 
day he led his men into one of those 
civilian massacre things. Killed a 
whole village of them, burning the 
kids up in the school house.” 
Lieutenant Schmidt winced. 

Tad held his peace for a time. 
The older cop said finally, “That 
was a long time ago. Tad. More 
than twenty years. The median age 
in the United States of the 
Americas is twenty-five. In short, 
most people can’t even remember 
back to the Asian War. A lot of us 
did things that we don’t like to 
think about any more. I w'as part of 
a bomber crew in the Asian War. 
God only knows where some of the 
bombs we dropped hit. We even 
layed them on towns that were in 
the part of the country we were 
supposedly trying to defend. God 
only knows how many children the 



bombs that left my plane killed.” 
He paused, and his face was empty, 
there was the same sickness that 
had been in the face of John 
Cardin. “Probably more than the 
number that died in that school.” 
Tad didn’t say anything. 

The older man spoke up again, 
finally. “It was a long time ago, 
Tad.” 

Tad didn’t say anything. 
Schmidt had let his pipe go out. 
He relit it with a match from the 
old fashioned box of kitchen 
matches he affected. 

He said, “Tad, it was a long time 
ago. Like 1 told you, I checked out 
the Brothers’ Crime Dossier. He 
had nothing at all on him until just 
two years ago when he ran into 
those two Black funkers. Those 
were bad boys. Tad.” 

Tad Boleslaw nodded. “Evident- 
ly they were. And- what you say is 
true. He has nothing on his record 
since the war. until that. But there 
are some other angles.” 

“Such as?” The older man’s 
voice was skeptical. 

Tad brought his notebook from 
his pocket. He said, “I checked out 
his daughter, Tilly. Just on, sort of, 
instinct. Two months before he had 
his shoot-out with those two 
Negros, she was gang-raped by a 
half dozen or so street bums. They 
never caught them. Tilly is just a 
bit around the corner these days.” 
The lieutenant, who somehow' 
hadn’t been able to get his pipe go- 
ing again, fixed his eyes upon his

junior and said, ‘‘Okay. Go on.” 
Tad said doggedly, “Brothers 
had a nice home out of town aways. 
He moved into the slums where he 
lives now. He began to collect guns. 
He joined the CAP. He tried to get 
into the National Guard, which 
turned him down in view of his 
Asian War thing, 1 suppose.” 

"Go on.” 

"He began to what amounted to 
prowling the’ streets — armed. By 
the way. I suspect he wears bullet- 
proof clothes.” 

“Why do you suspect that?” 

"It comes back to me. The way 
he looked that night when Kelly 
and I picked him up. Sophisticated 
bullet-proof stuff. The kind the 
army has. Not hard to come by — 
surplus army stores and so on.” 
"Go on.” 

"He’s out looking for trouble. 
Norm. He finds it. And he has no 
mercy. So okay, his liking for 
killing was submerged for twenty 
years. But then his kid was raped. 
He's prejudiced. All these supposed 
muggers and stick-up artists he’s 
killed are either Negros, Latin 
Americans, or Italians. Jesus, even 
when 1 gave him my Polish name 
the other night he tightened up. 
He’s a psycho. Norm. His wife left 
him a couple of years ago; she must 
have been afraid." 

“So what are you going to do 
about it?" 

Tad stared at him. “1 brought it

his face. If you make that mistake, 
he might remember it, if only sub- 
consciously. and then be surprised, 
possibly several blocks later, to see 
that face again. Unless they have 
reason to suspect they are being 
followed, few persons consider it. It 
isn't part of the usual experience. 

It went on for almost two weeks 



and then there was a seeming 
change in atmosphere. Tad Bole- 
slaw got the impression that either 
Brothers had tagged him or that 
the man had something out of the 
ordinary in mind. 

He wasn’t particularly afraid 
that the other would recognize him. 
The small man had seen him only 
in uniform, some weeks ago, and 
even then only twice and for short 
periods of time. Besides, Tad had 
assumed a bit of disguise, had 
darkened his complexion and put 
pads of cotton in his cheeks to 
change the contours of his face. He 
would have had to be quite close to 
his quarry to have been recognized. 

But this night the other was from 
time to time looking over his shoul- 
der, seemingly a fraction on the 
nervous side. Peering, occasionally, 
right or left. 

Brothers varied in the route he 
took walking home. It was about a 
tw o and a half mile hike and there 
were three different ways he 
covered it. Tad Boleslaw had al- 
ready figured out the one he was 
taking this time, and remained ahe 
of his quarry and, at first, on the 
opposite side of the street which 
was even more than usually de- 
serted this night. 

T ad got the feeling that this was 
it. And something, almost ESP, 
told him that the crisis was just 
about to be reached. 

He crossed back to the other side 
of the street and entered a doorway, 
nonchalantly thumping a rolled 



30 



GALAXY 




newspaper against his leg. The 
door was seemingly that to his 
home. He had noted from the other 
side that the doorway was open. A 
delapidated apartment house, 
typical of this slum neighborhood. 
He closed the door behind him, all 
but a crack, and waited. 

Had it been rehearsed, it 
couldn’t have come off more 
cleanly. 

He heard a voice, and could 
recognize it as that of Brothers, say 
coldly. “Hold it, you funker!” 

And another voice, indignantly. 
“What kind of shit is this? There’s 
no use sticking me up. Do I look 
like some millionaire?" 

And Brothers again. "You 
damned gook funker. What're you 
doing on the streets this time of 
night?" His voice was going high. 
“Looking for some poor girl to 
rape, some honest citizen to mug?” 

"Who the hell are you? You a 
cop?” 

Tad Boleslaw flicked off the dim 
light which illuminated the hall be- 
hind him and opened the door 
slightly wider. The two were only a 
few yards down from him. Impos- 
sibly. he had hit it almost on the 
nailhead. 

Brothers was standing there, in- 
effectual, as usual, in his appear- 
ance, but his gyro-jet rocket pistol 
in hand. The other was a young- 
ster. Puerto Rican, Cuban or Mexi- 
can. by the look of him. 

"I'm asking the questions,” 
Buddy Brothers said. 



The young fellow was indignant. 
“I'm going home from work. I’m 
assistant janitor at — ” 

"You’re a liar," the small man 
sneered. 

And then came something Tad 
Boleslaw hadn’t figured upon. 
Brothers dipped a hand into a side 
pocket of his jacket and brought 
forth a second gun. He tossed it to 
the feet of the other. 

He then brought forth from a 
pants pocket an emergency wrist 
alarm and flicked its activating 
stud. Almost immediately, sirens 
could be heard in the near distance. 

His face a mask of hate, the gyro- 
jet pistol came up. 

“That’ll be all. Buddy!" Tad 
called, and stepped from his place 
of concealment. Originally, he had 
planned to tackle the smaller man. 
Or, at least, that’s what he had told 
himself he planned. Schmidt 
stripping him of both uniform and 
weapon had left him up in the air. 
He knew he was being a damn fool 
trailing this killer without means of 
taking him. 

Charles Brothers swirled, his 
eyes gawking behind the lenses of 
his spectacles. 

Tad had already pulled the 
cotton from his cheeks. Now he 
took off his hat and let it drop to 
the street, so that the other could 
recognize him. 

The young fellow had shrunk 
back against the wall, his eyes, too, 
gaping. 

Tad Boleslaw looked at the 



CRY WOLF 



31 




killer. He said. “You cried wolf 
once too oflen.” 

"What are you talking about?” 
the other snarled, his gun now 
directed at the patrolman. 

"The old fairy story about the 
kid who was a shepherd. They told 
him if he ever saw a wolf to sound 
his horn and yell ‘wolf and they’d 
come running. But he used to do it 
just for the Dutch of it — for the ex- 
citement. He used to call wolf when 
there wasn't any wolf. He finally 
got it in the neck, though somewhat 
differently than the way you have.” 

Brothers was staring at him, 
breathing deeply. The siren swelled 
in the background. 

Tad shook his head and said, “1 
hadn't figured it. That first shoot- 
out you had with the two Blacks 
was legitimate. They really did try 
to jump you. But then that kill-love 
came back to you and all these 
more recent shootings have been 
set-ups. You'd find some kid, alone 
in the streets at night, and toss an 
unlraceable gun at his feet, activate 
your wrist emergency alarm, and 
then let him have it. The way you 
let those defenseless people have it 
in the Asian War. You’re around 
the corner. Brothers. Drop the 
gun.” 

The other’s eyes were darting 
every which way. He brought the 
super-lethal weapon up. 

Tad said emptily, “Charles 
Brothers, would you shoot an 
officer of the law, pursuing his 
duty? You too are supposedly an 



officer of the law, serving our city.” 

"They were gooks,” the other 
said shrilly. “They’re all the same. 
They’re no good. All you can do is 
kill them, when you find them on 
the streets, raping girls, sticking up 
honest — ” 

Tad said, “Drop the gun. Buddy 
Brothers.” 

Instead, the small man, incon- 
gruous as a killer with his glasses 
and his ineffectual mustache, 
turned and darted for the corner. 

He made it just in time to dash in 
front of the siren screaming patrol 
car — supposedly coming to his 
rescue. He shrilled first despair and 
then agony. 

Lieutenant Schmidt issued forth, 
looked down at the shattered body, 
then up at Tad Boleslaw. 

Tad said, “He was setting this 
kid up for another killing. He 
tossed one of those illegal, untrace- 
able guns to the sidewalk in front of 
him. H e was all ready to shoot 
when I got into the act.” 

Schmidt looked down at the dead 
man for a long weary moment. He 
said finally, “1 suppose there’s a 
moral here, somewhere. Wars 
aren't the best thing in the world to 
happen. And they don’t end — the 
results of them — when the actual 
shooting stops." 

Tad said, his voice empty. “I’ll 
go over and tell Tilly. She obviously 
already knew her father was a 
psycho, poor kid. That’s why she 
was afraid. She knew it was only a 
matter of time.” *

T here was nothing but fire in the 
air as the first of the ships rose, 
one, two, three, from their berths. 
There were roars like blasts of hate- 
ful sound blown upward from the 
depths of pits run by mechanical 
demons and full of the anguish of 
unrepentant automobiles. There 
was Ember-Eyes, coming over the 
lip of the valley, into fire and noise, 
shrieking after the departing 
vessels, “You can’t do this!” 
Ember- Eyes staggered down the 
slope, gasping in the hot air. He 
moved on three feet and used the 
talon-tipped fingers of his free paw- 
hand to massage the Mark of the 
Beast, circuit-printed into the flesh 
over his heart. The searing agony 
radiated by the Mark worsened 
with each step he took toward the 
launch site on the valley floor. The 
fire in his chest spread down into 
his bowels and, hotter than super- 
novae, cored out his marrow bones. 
He fell many times. Two more ships 
had lifted off and escaped him by 
the time he reached the floor of the 
valley and came to the launch site’s 
outer fence. 

Ember-Eyes hooked his stubby 
fingers through the metal links and 
sagged against the barrier. “You 
can’t leave us,” he growled 
hoarsely. “We need you, we need 
you . .” 

• He let go of the fence and slid to 
his knees in the gravel. Beyond the 
fence was a narrow, ditch-bordered 
service road and, beyond that, a 
second fence, lower than the first. 



Next came a quarter-mile-wide 
strip of deep grass and, finally, the 
great white concrete plain, rolling 
across the valley floor, past the 
launch pads, past squat black 
buildings, to more grass, blacktop 
and metal links. 

He fought down his agony and 
rose to his hind feet with effort, 
took a couple of deep, steadying 
breaths and then clawed his way up 
the fence. Fifteen feet high, the 
fence was topped with triple rows of 
barbed wire, braced at intervals 
with steel prongs projecting out- 
wards at a forty-five degree angle. 
Seizing one of the prongs, Ember- 
Eyes eased himself over the wire 
and succeeded in avoiding all but a 
few of the barbs. Crouched atop the 
fence, shifting on his feet to 
maintain balance, he was about to 
leap for the service road when a 
pencil-thick beam of bluish-white 
light flashed out of the darkness 
and sliced through metal links close 
to his left hind paw. The beam 
started to track toward him but 
winked out of existence too soon. 

It was enough, however, to 
startle him. Ember- Eyes fell for- 
ward, snarling with panic, and 
landed in ditch muck with the 
breath knocked out of him. Writh- 
ing with new pain, he thrashed 
amid the mud and weeds and was 
vaguely conscious of new fires in 
the night as another of the ships got 
away from him. 

And his renewed sense of having 
been betrayed was like a cold, hard 



34 



GALAXY 




fist closing around his heart. 

J hey would not come with me, 
my own children and my chil- 
dren’s children would not help me. 
You hate the human beings too 
much, they told me, and / shrieked 
at them. Yes! yes! I hate the human 
beings, I remember the feel of their 
fire and steel in my flesh and bones, 
1 can still hear their ghost whispers 
in my head, telling me what was ex- 
pected of me, telling me what I was 
in their eyes so that I would hate 
them all the more intensely for 
having made a play-thing of me, for 
having refashioned me in the image 
of their ancient terrors, that I 
might prowl in the darkness outside 
their city of light and afford them 
excitement, yes, yes, I hate the 
human beings, yes, and now, now 
they're bored again, they’re going 
away, they’ve moved out of their 
city, they’ve erected strange 
machines in the valley, but we 
won’t let them get away, we won’t 
let them discard us — 

They would not come with me. 
My children, my children’s chil- 
dren, they all refused to help me. 
They were bom changed, not re- 
built as I was, they were bom 
changed, and they have been 
capable of thought all their lives. 
And they think thoughts that are 
strange to me. 

/ am betrayed on every hand. 

T he fire and thunder of the 
vessel’s departure died away, 



and Ember-Eyes lay still in the 
ditch, listening. 

He heard soft, tinny footfalls. 

He saw the guard. 

The sentry glided out of the 
darkness on legs that were thin 
metal rods. Its hemispherical feet 
made faint clacking sounds as they 
struck the pavement. Insect-like, 
its head burned silver when moon- 
light struck it, then golden as it re- 
flected the flames spouting from 
the next ship in line to take off. A 
long, slim traser wand was held at 
the ready in a curled-up spider of a 
fist. 

Ember- Eyes shifted position in 
the ditch as he sized up the sentry. 
Dextrous rather than rugged, the 
robot had been designed for main- 
tenance work, not fighting. Ember- 
Eyes grinned toothily and waited 
until the robot, ignorant of the in- 
truder’s flanking movement, drew 
abreast of him. 

Then the creature in the ditch 
came up out of the mud and 
shadows with jaws distended and 
forepaws outstretched. The robot 
wheeled and jerked the deadly 
wand around but had no chance to 
fire. The weapon spun out of the 
guard’s claw as Ember-Eyes struck. 

The robot reacted almost at once 
by clamping a steel-tarantula hand 
around its attacker’s vaguely 
canine snout. As cartilage in his 
face began to pop, Ember-Eyes 
reared and shook his head 
violently, tearing himself free and 
sending the sentry skidding on its 



EMBER EYES 



35 




flat buttocks across the blacktop, 
toward the inner fence. 

It was on its feet again im- 
mediately, just quickly enough for 
its leaping black opponent to butt it 
backward through the air into the 
shallower ditch on that side of the 
road. The gleaming cranium 
grazed the fence, the bulbous metal 
eyes exploded and, for a few 
seconds, the sunburst at the 
perimeter of the launch site rivaled 
anything in the heavens. 

Ember-Eyes did not pause to 
appreciate the sight. He scooped up 
the traser wand and, holding it 
clumsily, pointed it at the inner 
fence. He had seen the wands used 
in the city of light, when the human 
beings had had him that time, and 
he knew what to expect when he 
applied pressure to the firing 
button. But he nonetheless dropped 
the wand when it flashed away a 
section of the fence before him. 
Retrieving the weapon, he fired 
again and again until he had sliced 
a wide gap in the electrified barrier. 
Then, tossing the wand away, he 
dropped to all fours and plunged 
into the high grass. 

And, out on the white concrete 
plain, another ship coughed like a 
Titan clearing his throat and began 
to rise. 

You can't leave us! Ember-Eyes 
wanted to scream the words, but he 
had no breath for cries, only for 
running. The Mark of the Beast, 
forgotten during the fight with the 
robot, burned in his body. 



The ships rose, one, two, three. 

/ won 't let you leave! 1 need you ’ 
I need you! 

The ships rose. 

And you need me, you made me. 
you must still need me, don't you, 
don’t you? 

He stumbled out of the grass and 
onto the concrete, and he could sec 
human beings moving around the 
base of the nearest ship, one half- 
mile away, and he ignored the fire 
in his flesh, the roar in his ears, and 
ran. He had covered half the dis- 
tance to the nearest vessel when he 
abruptly crumpled and skidded on 
his face. The pain was too great. He 
pushed himself up and tried to 
make his mouth form the words he 
had heard the human beings use in 
their city, but only howls came 
forth. Through the murk of his 
agony, he saw that the human 
beings were now entering the ship, 
the last ship, the very last . , . 

Ember-Eyes dragged himself 
forward half the length of his body 
and crumpled again. 

Then the pain in his body 
diminished. The Mark of the Beast 
cooled. 

He panted on the concrete and 
glared at the ship. He felt turned to 
lead. He had failed. 

He saw one of the last human be- 
ings turn and wave to him fondly, 
and he raked his claws on the con- 
crete in an agony of frustration, he 
snarled his hatred, too weak now to 
howl, and he watched in horror as 
the last human beings filed into the 



36 



GALAXY 




vessel, watched as the boarding 
rump automatically slid away from 
I he base of the ship, as the hatches 
dosed and sealed themselves . 

Go home, said a spirit voice in 
his head . Go home, little wolverine. 

Ember-Eyes tore at his skull, try- 
ing to dislodge the voice. 

Go home, insisted the voice. You 
are not safe hebe. 

“You can’t . discard me like 
this,” he muttered. “You took me 
und remade me, you gave me a pur- 
pose. and you gave me the power of 
thought so that my knowledge of 
that purpose would make me hate 
you all the more . what can I do, 
if not hate you and prey upon you? 
What—” 

Go home. And images flooded 
Ember-Eyes’ mind. He saw a fire 
cloud erupting from the craft on 
the pad a quarter of a mile away, he 
saw the concrete blackening and 
cracking with heat, he saw steel 
bubbling and running like water, 
he saw his own hair disappearing in 
a white flash, saw his flesh crisping, 
melting away from bones that 
turned to ash. 

He cast a final look of hungry 
longing at the last of the ships, then 
turned and began dragging himself 
back the way he had come. 

Fly, urged the voice. 

He forced himself to trot as, be- 
hind him, the ship rumbled 
ominously. He trotted faster, feel- 
ing adrenalin wash through him, he 
put his belly close to the ground 
and ran, felt grass whip his jowls as

he left the concrete plain, felt his 
claws tearing up the dirt as he 
ran — 

— felt a wall of heated air sweep 
him forward, raising his hind- 
quarters and shoving his snout into 
the sod, singeing his fur, bouncing 
him unceremoniously for a dozen 
feet, and noise light noise heat light 
noise . 

Blackness. 

He could not have been uncon- 
scious for longer than seconds 
because, when he opened his eyes, 
he was on his back in the grass, 
kicking at the air, and he could see 
the ship climbing, slowly at first 
but gaining speed, growing 
smaller, and he tried to cal! after it, 
call it back down to earth, but there 
was too little air in his lungs, too 
little air, and there was no longer a 
spirit voice in his head, only a roar. 

And he had failed. 

And he slept. 

E mber-eyes left the launch site 
shortly before the moon set. 
He passed several more of the light 
robots on his way out, but they lay 
still, did not dispute his passage. 
Nor did current flow through the 
inner fence. The robots and the 
electrified fence, like the Mark of 
the Beast, like Ember-Eyes him- 
self, had served their purpose. No 
longer needed, they had been shut 
off. Ember-Eyes envied them and 
hated himself for doing so. 

He spent the day resting on the 
lip of the valley. His face ached, his 



lungs burned whenever he tried to 
breathe deeply, and large patches 
of fur had been singed away, re- 
vealing pinkish blisters on the skin. 

When night fell, he made his 
slow, painful way back to his terri- 
tory to the south of the city of light. 
He sat down beneath a tree on a hill 
overlooking the city and waited 
and, by and by. Stripe, his favorite 
son, crept out of the darkness to sit 
beside him. 

“You look a little the worse for 
wear,” Stripe said in a respectful 
tone. 

Ember-Eyes glared at him for a 
moment, then fastened his gaze on 
the blindingly bright city below the 
hill. “1 failed. Stripe.” 

Stripe contemplated the ground 
between his forepaws. “We knew 
that you would,” he said quietly. 
“We told you that you would. Are 
you hungry. Father? I killed a deer 
this morning. The carcass is buried 
not far from here.” 

“I wish I could make you under- 
stand, Stripe. I failed. I failed. I 
went after the human beings to 
show them that I refused to be a 
mere play-thing, that I could still 
exert a little control over my own 
destiny. That they could not simply 
cast me aside when they were 
through with me. That . .” 
He shook his head miserably. 
“What happened. Father?” 
"They . they humiliated me 
again, Stripe. They made me the 
terror of their nights and then, 
down in the valley, they made me

feel terror. One of them spoke to 
me and told me to run away from 
the ship before it took off. And I 
ran away. From start to finish, 
Stripe, they had things their way." 

"Let them go. Father. You can 
live your own life now.” 

"They were my life. They thrust 
me into the night and let me give 
them the pleasure of fear, of being 
hated and stalked.” 

Stripe rose and stretched. “They 
tired of it. Father. They grew up, 
and something in their flesh, 
something irresistable, told them 
that the moment had come for 
them to leave.” 

“To what purpose. Stripe?” 

"To whatever purpose. Father. 
They grew up. We’re growing up, 
too. There will be better things for 
us to do in days to come than — ” 
“Go away. Stripe. You confuse 
me.” 

Stripe said nothing for a long 
moment. Then: “I’m sorry. Father. 
Do you want to eat the deer?” 

"No. Leave me alone, Stripe. Go 
away.” 

“We could go down into the city 
and — ” 

Ember-Eyes snarled and lunged, 
but Stripe dodged and skipped 
away from his father’s fangs. They 
eyed each other tensely. “I won’t go 
down into the city,” Ember-Eyes 
growled savagely. 

“The Mark of the Beast can no 
longer hurt us,” Stripe said, “and 
there are things there that — ” 

“Go away. Stripe!” 



“I’m sorry,” Stripe muttered 
sadly. “Goodbye, Father.” 

E mber-eyes watched his favor- 
ite son turn and lope away in 
the direction of the city of light, 
and he somehow knew that not 
much time would pass before Stripe 
and the rest of his progeny no long- 
er remembered the nights spent 
lurking just beyond the lighted 
perimeter of the city, that they 
would no longer speak of how the 
men and women who ventured 
forth sometimes died squealing 
with delight and of how that delight 
had served to make the lurkers hate 
all the more intensely. They would 
think thoughts increasingly strange 
to Ember- Eyes. 

Down the hill. Stripe paused and 
looked back over his shoulder. 
“We’re growing up,” he said, a 
low, soft sound, and was gone. 

Ember-Eyes gazed at the city for 
a long time before limping away 
into the evening. And his renewed 
sense of having been betrayed was 
like a cold, hard fist closing around 
his heart. He had been remade, he 
had been told what was expected of 
him and had been apprised to the 
fullest extent of his capabilities. He 
had been made a creature of the 
night, a deliberately intended mon- 
ster, and there was no place for him 
in the city of light. He had been 
cheated from the start. 

There was no more growing up in 
store for him. *

FORUM 

ESCAPE ROUTES 

This paper is an amalgamation and summation of several talks I have 
given during the past year to various groups of teachers of sf, in Oregon, 
at the California Association of Teachers of English, and in Milwaukee. 
Parts of the talks were directed toward specific problems and tech- 
niques of teaching sf, and I have omitted these. But, if I have been 
creeping around behind science fiction's back talking about it to aca- 
demics, science liction has a right to know what I’ve been saying. So I 
tried to put the drift and gist of it into this paper. 

URSULA K. LE GUIN 



the 1974 meeting of the 
Science Fiction Research 
Association, an annual event which 
I like to call The Bride of Franken- 
stein in the Grove of Academe, 
Alexei and Cory Panshin held forth 
eloquently against the teaching of 
science fiction in schools and 
colleges. It seemed a bit quixotic, 
since their audience consisted of 
teachers of science fiction, people 
so interested in and committed to 
the subject that they had come 
from all over the country to talk 
about it and learn how to do it 
better; since thousands of high 
schools give science fiction courses 
now, and the stuffiest college Eng- 
lish departments are stooping to 
conquer. I don't think there’s really 
much question, now, of keeping the 
professors off Aldebaran. They’re 
there. And that face looking out of 



the fifth story window of the Ivory 
Tower, that’s the Little Green 
Man. For myself, I accept this 
miscegenation happily, and am 
simply interested in what the off- 
spring may be. 

For undoubtedly the recent great 
increase in the teaching of sf is 
going to affect the writing of sf. 
Our audience has widened im- 
mensely; and for the first time, we 
in the sf ghetto are beginning to get 
criticism — not brush-offs from 

literary snobs, and not blasts of 
praise and condemnation from 
jealous, loyal, in-group devotees, 
but real criticism, by trained, in- 
telligent people who have read 
widely both inside and outside the 
field. This could be the best thing 
that ever happened to sf, the confir- 
mation of it, both to its readers and 
to its writers, as a powerful and 



40 



responsible art form. 

A ghetto is a comfortable, re- 
assuring place to live, but it is also 
a crippling place to live. The 
essence of a ghetto, after all, is that 
you are forced to live there. To 
choose the ghetto when one is free 
to choose the greater community is 
an act of cowardice. Now that the 
walls are breaking down, 1 think it 
behooves us to' step across the 
rubble and face the city outside. 
We need not lose our solidarity in 
doing so. Solidarity, loyalty, is not 
a prison, where you can’t choose: it 
is a choice freely made. But equally 
we shouldn’t expect to be welcomed 
with songs of praise by all the 
strangers out there. Why should we 
be? We’re strangers to them, too. If 
we have weaknesses we must learn 
to take criticism of them; if we have 
strengths we must prove them. 

One way we can show our 
strength is by helping the serious 
critics of sf to set up a critical 
apparatus, a set of standards, 
suited to the study and teaching of 
sf. Some of the criteria by which the 
conventional novel is discussed and 
judged apply to sf, and some don’t. 
Teachers can’t switch from a tale 
OF TWO CITIES to THE MAN IN THE 
high castle without changing 
gears; if they do, one book or the 
other is going to be misinterpreted, 
mistreated. Fortunately, in two 
areas at least, sf has established its 
own standards, and has been 
applying them with increasing 
severity, in writing, in teaching 



writing, and in teaching sf as 
literature. 

The first of these is the criterion 
of intellectual coherence and 
scientific plausibility. 

The basic canon of fantasy, of 
course, is: you get to make up the 
rules, but then you've got to follow 
them. Science fiction refines upon 
this: you get to make up the rules, 
but within limits. A science fiction 
story must not flout the evidence of 
science, must not, as Chip Delany 
puts it, deny what is known to be 
known. Or if it does, the writer 
must know it, and defend the 
liberty taken, either with a genuine 
hypothesis or with a sound, con- 
vincing fake. If I give my space- 
ships FTL speed, I must be aware 
that I’m contradicting Albert Ein- 
stein, and accept the conse- 
quences — all the consequences. In 
this, precisely, lies the unique 
aesthetic delight of sf, in the in- 
tense, coherent following-through 
of the implications of an idea, 
whether it’s a bit of far-out tech- 
nology, or a theory in quantum 
mechanics, or a satirical projection 
of current social trends, or a whole 
world created by extrapolating 
from biology and ethnology. When 
such an idea is consistently worked 
out in material, intellectual, social, 
psychological, and moral terms, 
something solid has been done, 
something real: a thing which can 
be read, taught, and judged 
squarely on its own terms. The 
“sense of wonder” isn’t a feeble 



41 




perfume, it’s built right into a good 
story, and the closer you look the 
stronger the sense of wonder. 

A second criticism is that of 
stylistic competence. 

You know what sf was like in the 
Golden Age of Science Fiction. You 
know. It was like this. “Oh, Pro- 
fessor Higgins.” cooed the slender, 
vivacious Laura, “but do tell me 
how does the antipastomatter de- 
nudifier work?” Then Professor 
Higgins, with a kindly, absent- 
minded smile, explains how it 
works for about six pages, garble 
garble garble. Then the Starship 
Captain steps in, with a tight, twist- 
ed smile on his lean, bronzed face. 
His steely grey eyes glint. He lights 
a cigarette and inhales deeply. 
“Oh, Captain Tommy,” Laura in- 
quires with a vivacious toss of her 
head, “is there anything wrong?” — 
“Don’t worry your pretty little head 
about it,” the Captain replies, in- 
haling deeply. “A fleet, of nine 
thousand Gloobian Slime Monsters 
off the port side, that’s all.” And so 
on. You know. American sf used to 
be a pulp medium, popcult, all 
that. Now it isn't — not all of it, any- 
how. It has rejoined the sf of Eng- 
land and Europe, which was 
sparse, but which never was 
schlock except when it imitated us, 
and which was always part of the 
major tradition of fiction. And 
therefore it is to be judged, not as 
schlock, not as junk, but as fiction. 

What I’m saying is neither self- 
evident, nor popular. Within the sf 



ghetto, many people don’t want 
their books, or their favorite 
writers’ books, judged as literature. 
They want junk, and they bitterly 
resent aesthetic judgment of it. 
And outside the ghetto, there are 
critics who like to stand above sf, 
looking down upon it, and there- 
fore want it to be junky, popcult, 
contemptible. There was a strong 
vein of this in Gerald Jonas’ other- 
wise perceptive New Yorker article, 
and it’s one of the many games 
Leslie Fiedler plays. Fortunately 
it’s a game that our best sf critic, 
Darko Suvin, never plays. I 
consider it a real cop-out, an arro- 
gance towards both the books and 
their readers. 

T here is an area where sf has 
most often failed to judge itself, 
and where it has been most harshly 
judged by its nonpartisans. It is an 
area where we badly need intelli- 
gent criticism and discussion. The 
oldest argument against sf is both 
the shallowest and the profoundest: 
the assertion that sf, like all fantasy 
is escapist. 

This statement is shallow when 
made by the shallow. When an in- 
surance broker tells you that sf 
doesn’t deal with the Real World, 
when a chemistry freshman informs 
you that Science has disproved 
Myth, when a censor suppresses a 
book because it doesn’t fit the 
canons of Socialist Realism, and so 
forth, that’s not criticism; it’s 
bigotry. If it’s worth answering, the 



42 



GALAXY 




best answer was given by Tolkien, 
author, critic, and scholar. Yes, he 
said, fantasy is escapist, and that is 
its glory. If a soldier is imprisoned 
by the enemy, don’t we consider it 
his duty to escape? The money- 
lenders, the knownothings, the 
authoritarians have us all in prison; 
if we value the freedom of the mind 
and soul, if we’re partisans of 
liberty, then it's our plain duty to 
escape, and to take as many people 
with us as possible. 

But people who are not fools or 
bigots, people who love both art 
and liberty, critics as responsible as 
Edmund Wilson, reject science 
fiction flatly as a genre simply not 
w'orth discussing. Why? What 
makes them so sure? 

The question, after all, must be 
asked: From what is one escaping, 
and to what? 

Evidently, if we’re escaping a 
world that consists of Newsweek, 
Pravda, and the Stock Market Re- 
port, and asserting the existence of 
a primary, vivid world, an mtenser 
reality where joy, tragedy, and 
morality exist, then we’re doing a 
good thing, and Tolkien is right. 
But what if we’re doing just the 
opposite? What if we’re escaping 
from a complex, uncertain, fright- 
ening world of death and taxes into 
a nice simply cozy place where 
heroes don’t have to pay taxes, 
where death happens only to 
villains, where Science, plus Free 
Enterprise, plus the Galactic Fleet 
in black and silver uniforms, can 



solve all problems, where human 
suffering is something that can be 
cured — like scurvy? This is no es- 
cape from the phony. This is an es- 
cape into the phony. This 
doesn’t take us in the direction of 
the great myths and legends, which 
is always toward an intensification 
of the mystery of the real. This 
takes us the other way, toward a 
rejection of reality, in fact toward 
madness: infantile regression, or 
paranoid delusion, or schizoid 
insulation. The movement is retro- 
grade, autistic. We have escaped by 
locking ourselves in jail. 

And inside the padded cell the 
people sit and say, Gee wow have 
you read the latest Belch the Bar- 
barian story? It’s the greatest. 

They don’t care if anybody out- 
side is listening. They don’t want to 
know that there is an outside. 

Because the most famous works 
of sf are socially and ethically 
speculative, the field has got a 
reputation for being inherently 
“relevant.” Accused of escapism, it 
defends itself by pointing to Wells, 
Orwell, Huxley, Gapek, Stapledon, 
Zamyatin. But that won’t wash: not 
for us. Not one of those writers was 
an American. My feeling is that 
American sf, while riding on the 
reputation of great European 
works, still clings to the pulp tradi- 
tion of escapism. 

That’s overstated, and perhaps 
unfair. Recent American sf has 
been full of stories tackling 
totalitarianism, nationalism, over- 



FORUM — ESCAPE ROUTES 



43 




population, pollution, prejudice, 
racism, sexism, militarism, and so 
on: all the “relevant” problems. 
AGAIN, DANGEROUS VISIONS was a 
regular textbook in Problems (and 
my story was one of the chapters). 
But what worries me is that so 
many of these' stories and books 
have been written in a savagely self- 
righteous tone, a tone that implies 
that there’s an answer, a simple 
answer, and why can’t all you damn 
fools out there see it? Well, I call 
this escapism: a sensationalist rais- 
ing of a real question, followed by a 
quick evasion of the weight and 
pain and complexity involved in 
really, experientially, trying to 
understand and cope with that 
question. And by the way, I’m not 
talking only about the reactionary, 
easy-answer schools of sf, the tech- 
nocrats, scientologists, “liber- 
tarians,” and so on, but also about 
the chic nihilism affected by many 
talented American and English 
writers of my generation. Annihila- 
tion is the easiest answer of all. You 
just close all the doors. 

I f science fiction has a major 
gift to offer literature, I think it 
is just this: the capacity to face an 
open universe. Physically open, 
psychically open. No doors shut. 

What science, from physics and 
astronomy to history and psychol- 
ogy, has given us, is the open uni- 
verse: a cosmos that is not a simple, 
fixed hierarchy, but an immensely 
complex process in time. All the 



doors stand open, from the pre- 
human past through the incredibte 
present to the terrible and hopeful 
future. All connections are possible. 
All alternatives are thinkable. It is 
not a comfortable, reassuring 
place. It’s a very large house, a very 
drafty house. But it’s the house we 
live in. 

And science fiction seems to be 
the modern literary art which is 
capable of living in that huge and 
drafty house, and feeling at home 
there, and playing games up and 
down the stairs, from basement to 
attic. 

I think that’s why kids like sf, 
and demand to be taught it, to 
study it, to take it seriously. They 
feel this potential it has for playing 
games with and making sense and 
beauty out of our fearfully enlarged 
world of knowledge and percep- 
tion. And that’s why it gripes me 
when I see sf failing to do so, falling 
back on silly, simplistic reassur- 
ances, or whining Woe, woe, 
repent, or taking refuge in mere 
wishful thinking. 

So I welcome the study and 
teaching of sf — so long as the 
teachers will criticise us, demand- 
ingly, responsibly, and make the 
students read us demandingly, 
responsibly. If sf is treated, not as 
junk, not as escapism, but as an 
intellectually, aesthetically, and 
ethically responsible art, a great 
form, it will become so: it will fulfill 
its promise. The door to the future 
will be open. ■*

LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



FRED SABERHAGEN 




WHA T HAS GONE BEFORE 

By the mid-21st century the 
revolution in sexual morals had ad- 
vanced to the point where chastity, 
and the repression or sublimation 
of sexual impulses were considered 
social offenses, if not actual 
crimes — but were still sought by 
many as secret pleasures. Most 
members of the Establishment be- 
longed to the Church of Eros. Con- 
currently, crowding and hunger in 
the world had led to severe restric- 
tions on reproduction even among 
the wealthy. A woman who had 
borne two children was required by 
law to have any subsequent preg- 
nancies aborted. 

ART RODNEY, California elec- 
tronics engineer and chessmaster, 
finds that his wife, RITA, has fled 
to Chicago to locate a midwifer and 
bear a third child rather than have 
the abortion required by law. Art 
pursues Rita to convince her that 
her plan is both wrong and 
dangerous before it is too late. 

Art's transcontinental tube train 
is halted at the Mississippi. Under 
attack there by rioters is a monas- 
tery of Christians ( a sect long in de- 
cline) where experiments on pre- 
serving life in freshly aborted 
fetuses are thought to be under 
way. Art helps a distraught girl 
named ROSAMOND JAMISON 
get on the train for Chicago. 

In Chicago, Rita's brother 
GEORGE PARR, a karate master, 
and his wife, ANN, live like many 



other city dwellers in a complex of 
townhouses fortified against the 
random violence of the age. Art ar- 
rives to find that Rita has come and 
gone, leaving the two Rodney chil- 
dren with Ann, a militant free- birth 
advocate and Christian. Art and 
Ann futilely argue the right and 
wrong of compulsory abortion in an 
overcrowded world. 

FRED LOHMANN, Ann’s 
brother, hwakens with his assigned 
roommate MARJORIE, in a Chi- 
cago Y ( Young Persons' Play 
Club), a strait-laced place where 
nightly sex activity is required of 
all. Fred is a karate student on his 
way to becoming an ape, the cur- 
rent term for one who roams the 
streets inflicting apparently point- 
less violence on strangers. 

MR. HALL, representing the 
Bureau of Family Planning, visits 
Art and is soon convinced that Art 
himself is innocent of conspiring 
toward an illegal birth. Hall brings 
him up to date: the very latest 
medical technology allows a just-re- 
moved fetus to be quick- frozen and 
later placed in an artificial womb 
where it will develop into a normal 
baby. ( Some doctors are preserving 
fetuses on moral grounds, while 
others are performing these illegal 
operations for the money . ) 

Art convinces the Parrs that he 
must be allowed to talk to Rita, 
face to face. George takes him on a 
tour of the city, supposedly to ar- 
range the contact but really to con- 
fuse any Family Planning agents 



46 



GALAXY 




who might be watching them. High 
points on the tour are a stadium 
where the unemployed are paid to 
watch , baseball, and rioting 
threatens when the home team 
loses; and a slumburb tavern where 
Art hears a disheartening broad- 
cast of world news. 

George takes Art to his karate 
dojo where Fred, who wants George 
to hire him as an instructor, has 
come to be evaluated. Fred fails in 
combat against humanoid karate- 
machines. One of George's stu- 
dents. Dr. Hammad, is introduced 
to Art as the man who can arrange 
his meeting with Rita. 

happened to see your wife 

X this morning,” the doctor was 
telling Art a few minutes later. 
“She’s in good health and good 
spirits.” The doctor was hanging 
his street clothes in a locker, 
getting ready for his private karate 
lesson. George was out in the main 
room of the dojo, discussing some 
refinement of mayhem with the 
bodyguard Ivor. From where Art 
stood in the locker room he could 
see Fred sitting out there too, the 
picture of defeat, head resting in 
his hands, blood drying brownish 
on his white jacket. His brown belt 
had come unknotted. 

“Where is she?” Art asked. 

“Understand, I have no direct 
connection with the place she’s 
staying at. It’s been my experience, 
though, that they do a good job of 
taking care of guests.” 



“You have no connection? 
Aren’t you the one who’s intending 
to—?” 

“Oh, no, no, I’m not handling 
your wife’s case myself. No, the 
connection between me and George 
is too obvious, you see. In such 
cases a referral to another physi- 
cian is more prudent.” 

“Who is he, then? When am I 
going to see her? When is the 
operation to be?” 

“It’ll be soon, I suppose. She’s 
young and healthy, and I would 
anticipate an uneventful parturi- 
tion and freezing.” 

The casual words brought on an 
icy congealing in Art’s own bone 
marrow. He had no clear idea of 
what a three-months’ fetus actually 
looked like, but in his mind he saw 
a mindless finger of tissue, ex- 
tracted like an appendix and then 
frozen into an icicle. 

He asked: “If a fetus is treated 
this way, then grown in one of those 
artificial wombs — what are its 
chances of becoming a normal 
child?” 

“Oh, very good. Excellent. Is 
that what’s worrying you? Don't let 
it. Freezing an organism that small 
and then revivifying it is nothing, 
these days. And an artificial womb 
actually offers several advantages 
over a full-term pregnancy and 
birth. Development of the fetus can 
be watched day by day and the flow 
of nutrients perfectly controlled. 
It’s much more physically con- 
venient for the mother, too, of 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



47 




course. I expect the FDA will re- 
lease the wombs for unrestricted 
use with legitimate children soon; 
they’re probably only delaying be- 
cause more women would want kids 
if pregnancy wasn’t such a bother.” 
Dr. Hammajj pulled on his loose 
white karate trousers; he smiled 
reassuringly, as if he had just 
solved all Art’s problems for him. 

“That’s all very well, doctor. 
That helps to ease my mind of one 
kind of worry. But now what about 
my wife?” 

“Oh, this is safer for her than a 
normal birth would be. I under- 
stand she’s had two of those.” 

“1 mean legally. Suppose she’s 
caught and convicted and sent to 
jail and sterilized against her will? 
What’s all that going to do to her?” 
"See here,” said Hammad 
sharply, “I thought you wanted this 
child. There are always certain 
risks involved, for everyone.” 

“I don’t want this frozen 
so-called child, Rita does. I want to 
talk to her, to reason with her, be- 
fore it’s too late.” 

The doctor had turned his face 
away and was adjusting his jacket, 
slowly and meticulously. “You’ll 
have to see someone else about it, 
then, Mr. Rodney. I told you I’m 
not operating.” 

“1 insist that I be allowed to see 
my wife, face to face!” Art was 
keeping his voice low, but he felt it 
becoming shaky with his anger. 
“Now you know where she can be 
found. And I’m quite ready to stir 



up trouble, if you refuse to help me 
talk to her!” 

Knotting a green belt at his 
waist, the doctor glared at Art as if 
he had found the wrong specimen 
laid out on a dissecting table. Art 
glared right back. 

“All right,” the doctor said at 
last. ‘Til find out if some arrange- 
ment can be made for her to phone 
you. Though it’s not wise, phones 
can be tapped. Where are you stay- 
ing?” 

"No. I want to be able to talk 
with her in person. Alone.” 

Hammad was ready now, but he 
did not go out. “All right, all right. 
It’s against my judgment but since 
you insist on taking the risk I’ll see 
if there’s any way a meeting can be 
arranged.” 

“Soon. Very soon.” 

“All right. Where can you be 
reached by phone?” 

F red Lohmann stood inside the 
Megiddo Bar & Coffee House, 
on the edge of a mean little urban 
BI district near State Street, not far 
from the Y where he was rooming. 
He was alone in a crowd. On a low 
dais some people with medieval 
musical instruments were twanging 
out a ballad about pure-hearted 
love, and a chill silence had crept 
into the huge dim room. The place 
was befogged with the exhaled 
smoke of several kinds of leaves 
and synthetic mixtures, tobacco be- 
ing only one. At every table there 
were glassy staring eyes, and few of 



48 



GALAXY 




them seemed to be aimed at any- 
body else. 

Fred slouched his tall frame over 
the coffeebar, nursing what they 
called a small Turkish, which had 
coffee and other things mixed in it, 
along with a vague dull hope that 
someone might ask him about the 
little bandage on the side of his 
head. After all, mighty few men 
could have handled those andys at 
the speed they were set for today. 
Not one in a hundred, probably, 
even given the chance to train, 
could do it. Black belt George, of 
course. Third degree black belt, no 
less. He probably set them on speed 
One and knocked them down like 
bowling pins. Toward George, Fred 
felt envy, but there was no malice in 
it. 

Karate was a good business to be 
in. You could get to meet some in- 
fluential people, people with class, 
like the Dr. Hammad who had 
come in and patched Fred’s scalp 
today. Afterward Fred had watched 
the doctor go through his private 
lesson, and George had used Fred 
to demonstrate a point or two, and 
had Fred spar freestyle with the 
doctor a little bit, taking it easy. 

Now Fred made a karate blade of 
his hand and chopped delicately, 
silently, at the edge of the bar. 
Then he stopped. Who cared? 
What was the use? George prob- 
ably could tell without even check- 
ing that he had been lying about 
having a brown belt. Sorry, George 
had said, no job now. Practice 



every day and we’ll see. George 
hadn't said every day for how long, 
but Fred knew it wouldn’t be for 
just a week or two. Months or 
maybe even a year before he got his 
stance and his control and 
everything else up to the standards 
George wanted in a brown or black 
belt, in a paid instructor. There 
was not much fun in grunting and 
sweating and working like a ma- 
chine for that length of time. And 
there was no guarantee that he 
would ever make it, so what was the 
sense in putting out that kind of 
effort? 

Up to the bar beside Fred there 
stepped a young man who looked 
like one who knew his way around. 
He was of average height, but so 
broad-shouldered that he appeared 
squat. Around his shoulders he 
wore the pelt, doubtless artificial, 
of what Fred supposed was a wolf; 
anyway it was a shaggy animal, 
with pointy little stick-up ears, 
beady glittering glass eyes, and 
sharp-looking sizable white teeth in 
a pink open plastic mouth. 

Fred hadn’t yet made contact 
with anyone who knew where he 
might buy some gladrags. “Hey,” 
he called quietly. 

The wolf-man turned, properly 
casual, and looked Fred over. 
“Hey,” he answered coolly. “You 
buyin’?” 

Fred waited long enough to show 
that he wasn’t being pushed into 
anything. “Got my check today, 
why not?” 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL

Fred and Wolf (“Call me Wolf, 
man.”) sat at a table, where they 
were soon joined by a friend of 
Wolf s called Lewandowski, who 
was drinking herb tea spiked with 
vodka. Fred bought another round 
for the three of them and decided it 
was the last he was going to buy. He 
sounded out Wolf and Lewandow- 
ski about gladrags. and they 
assured him that a man who sold 
such things would be around later. 

Wolf said he came from New 
York city. He let it be known that 
he had led a gang there and the 
New York police were looking for 
him so he had come west for his 
health. Fred could believe this 
about halfway. Lewandowski, a fat, 
strong-looking youth with empty 
eyes, was a native Chicagoan. Once 
he started talking it was hard to get 
him to shut up. He said he was 
looking for a job with, one of the 
policy wheels, legal or illegal made 
no difference to him; his old man 
was a compulsive gambler and he 
knew there was no money to be 
made on the sucker’s side of the 
operation. 

Neither of them asked Fred 
about his bandage, but he faked a 
little more headache than he 
actually felt and managed to reveal 
casually that he was a karate ex- 
pert, working hard for his black 
belt. He saw the others hardening 
their faces slightly to keep from 
showing that they were impressed. 
Probably they believed him about 
halfway as he did them. Well, he 



was telling them about half the 
truth. If only there was someone he 
could talk to. 

Finally Fred gave up waiting and 
bought yet another round, for 
-neither of the other two seemed to 
have any money. They both said 
they had been on BI for about a 
year, since abandoning school. And 
Wolf said he couldn’t even collect 
his checks these days or the New 
York police would Find out where 
he was and have him extradited. 

Fred began to feel a little drunk 
and sick, and his wounded head 
ached in earnest. The gladrag man 
Finally arrived and was pointed out 
to him, and as soon as he had the 
little carton in his pocket Fred went 
back to the Y. Marjorie wasn’t in, 
or else she wouldn't answer his 
tapping at her door. Without her 
unlatching her side of the bed, he 
couldn’t even let his down, and so 
was restricted to slouching on his 
spine in a chair with his feet up on 
his tiny table. He sat there in dizzy 
silence for a while, staring into the 
hot eyes of the Y’s founder, whose 
portrait decorated one wall. On an- 
other wall was the predictable print 
of Love Conquers All, the naked 
urchin wearing fake wings and pre- 
tending to be Eros, climbing out of 
bed and knocking down books and 
mathematical instruments and 
trampling a violin. That Garavag- 
gio had certainly known how to 
paint. That picture would be some- 
thing to try to carve in wood. 

He wanted Marjorie to come

back, and to hurry up about it. But 
maybe she had checked out, and 
tonight he would have to sleep with 
some real old-fashioned sex kitten, 
some real dog who studied an erotic 
manual every day. He didn’t know 
if he could take that now. 

One thing he sure wasn’t going to 
be able to take for very long tonight 
was sitting here alone. It was only 
about eight o’clock, not yet dark 
outside, and he was neither sober 
nor yet really high on the spiked 
coffee. He got up and went out, and 
had nowhere to go. In a little while 
he was heading back to the 
Megiddo, 

VII 

T he phone call got Art up from 
the Parrs’ dinner table. When 
Art had let the caller see him, a 
man's voice spoke briefly through a 
blanked screen, giving him direc- 
tions. “The corner of Belmont and 
Halsted. Be there in an hour. Don’t 
forget to come alone.” 

“How will I know — ?” but the 
connection had already been 
broken. 

George, who had been listening 
in the background, now looked 
worried, which did not help Art's 
nerves at all. Ann, smiling though 
she was worried too, came up to 
Art. “You’re going, then? Give 
Rita our love if you do get to see 
her. And listen to what she says. 
And don’t do anything foolish. You 
won’t get lost now, will you?” 



“No. No, I won’t. Well then. I’m 
off." He left the house before they 
could change their minds complete- 
ly and begin to argue with him not 
to go. He had prepared himself 
somewhat by purchasing a map of 
the city’s slidewalk system from an 
autovendor, and to pick out a good 
route to Belmont and Halsted was 
no trouble at all. He even detoured 
through a busy shopping center 
with the idea of shaking off any- 
body who might be trying to follow 
him. 

Chicago was a place where 
people walked, or at least rode 
standing on their moving walk- 
ways. In this it was unlike most of 
mid-California, where a man trying 
to move any distance on foot soon 
found himself a helpless alien in a 
world that had been planned and 
built and paved and spaced for sur- 
face vehicles. By night out there a 
walking man was a blind alien once 
the particular slidewalk or statwalk 
he was on had taken him out of the 
particular region where he lived. 
The tall islands of glittering build- 
ings seen in the distance all looked 
pretty much alike, and the daytime 
mountains were gone. A walking 
man could think that the passing 
tides and torrents of headlights and 
taillights went on forever. 

Here in Chicago things were 
closer together and more reach- 
able, more on a human scale, save 
for the towers that clustered in the 
center of the city, the place a few 
Chicagoans still called the Loop.

Here signs named the streets at 
every corner, address numbers were 
consistent where they could be 
seen, and the city was covered by 
the vast slidewalk grid. But now at 
sunset most of the walks were only 
thinly occupied. The crowded 
shopping center had evidently been 
fed most of its customers by surface 
vehicle, for its large parking lots 
looked nearly full. The people Art 
saw on the walks kept looking at 
one another in mutual wariness as 
they passed. 

Art kept to the main thorough- 
fares, which Ann had said were 
fairly well patroled by the police. 
Plenty of artificial light fell on the 
faintly whispering slidewalks, and 
on the new, high, blind walls that 
now made up so much of the city’s 
face. Next to the vehicle lanes of the 
street there usually came a strip of 
grass, then the whispering walk, a 
wider strip of grass and trees (no 
shrubbery, though, wherein a man 
might lurk), and then the walls, 
high and unscaleable. Walls of 
workerless, humming factories, or 
walls of defended blockhouses like 
George’s. Art, searching out his 
path tonight between the walls, was 
reminded of a maze he had once 
seen in the laboratory of a psychol- 
ogist who had been experimenting 
with rats. With the going of the 
sun, the trees growing in the tended 
spots and strips of grass took on an 
unreal, misplaced look. Their June 
leaves were as green as signals in 
the streetlights' brightness. And 



the streets’ steady vehicular traffic, 
dipping or rising as the streets 
passed under or over the moving 
walks, was also quite unreal to a 
slidewalking man; the people in the 
cars were like fish in an aquarium, 
dim sliding shapes bound into their 
own world. 

“See that one there?” the psy- 
chologist who ran the rats had said. 
“Looks fine and healthy, doesn’t 
he? Fat and sleek and bright-eyed 
compared with most of the others.” 

"How do you keep some of ’em 
that way, with so many crowded 
in?” 

"They’re supposed to be crowded 
in. I'm studying the effects of over- 
population. And he’s really no 
healthier than the others are. He’s 
like a sleepwalker, passive, non- 
sexual . .” 

“What about the others?” 

“Various reactions. See the 
shabby one with all the energy? 
He’s what we call a ‘prober’. 
Hyper- and homo-sexual. Hyper- 
active altogether, often turns canni- 
bal. Only good point is he's not a 
status-seeker as most of the males 
are." 



T hunder rumbled somewhere. 

Or was it thunder? Close above 
the streetlights the night pressed 
down, opaque and prematurely 
black. Above the brilliant lights 
there might be stars or clouds or 
watching eyes, nothing could be 
seen.

Art ran his maze. After leaving 
the shopping center he changed 
slidewalk directions twice, naviga- 
ting with his map. He was sliding 
east along Belmont Avenue, calcu- 
lating the distance to Halsted 
Street, when a passing police car 
slowed, keeping pace with him for 
ten or fifteen seconds. Art threw 
one half-scowling glance toward the 
car and just kept on walking, until 
it pulled away. 

A minute later he wished it back. 
Glancing down a comparatively 
dim side street as he crossed an 
intersection, he saw a group of four 
or five male figures walking to- 
gether two long blocks away. They 
were shouting in rough voices and 
waving their arms. Fortunately they 
were a little too far off to be con- 
cerned with Art. He would bet that 
they meant trouble for someone, 
though. 

Thunder rolled again. Hyper- 
active, and they often turned canni- 
bal. But the psychologist with his 
crowding studies had been too wise 
to offer any cure-all for human 
nastiness. Certainly not the simple 
absence of crowding. There was 
still plenty of violence on farms. 

Art’s nerves relaxed a little when 
the band of toughs passed out of 
sight, then tightened again as he 
arrived at the intersection to which 
he had been told to come. It was a 
busy place, the center of a small 
vending district. He alighted on a 
statwalk bathed in the rippling 
noon of a barred display window. 



People moved around him, shop- 
ping or aimlessly walking. No one 
moved at once to approach Art, 
and as far as he could tell no one 
was watching him. 

Another police car, or perhaps 
the same one, came easing around 
a corner, and Art turned away from 
it, pretending to study the contents 
of the vendor’s window. He heard 
the car halt just a little distance off, 
and wait there, turbines idling with 
a muffled whine. Maybe they were 
just keeping a protective watch over 
the pedestrians in sight. If they 
were trying to follow him to Rita, 
surely they would be more subtle 
about it than this. But now it 
seemed to Art that the police and 
Family Planning probably knew al- 
ready where she was. He pictured 
Hall conferring with cool and crafty 
agents, all of them agreeing to wait 
until the crime had been irrevoca- 
bly committed before they sprang 
their trap. We’re not out to get her, 
Hall had said. 

Art inventoried the window until 
he heard the police car pull away. A 
few seconds later another car drove 
up to the curb beside him, one of its 
windows lowered. A man’s voice 
called softly: “Are you Rodney?” 

“Yes.” Art skipped across the 
slidewalk to the curb. 

A rear door opened for him. 
“Get in.” 

He got in and pulled the door 
shut and the car moved out. There 
were two men with him in the car, 
one driving and the other beside 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



53 




Art in the rear. As soon as the auto 
had turned out of the busy intersec- 
tion, the man in back took Art by 
the neck and pushed him imper- 
sonally down to the floor. 

“We don’t wancha see where 
we're going. Get under this.” A 
musty-smelling: opaque blanket of 
some kind was thrown over his 
head. 

Opaque blankets like this one 
were not commonly found, in the 
possession of proper people. 
Suddenly all the possibilities of evil 
began to open. Art could fear that 
he was not being taken to Rita at 
all, he was being gotten rid of as a 
troublemaker. Meanwhile the car 
purred on, no one in it having any- 
thing to say. It stopped and started 
and turned in traffic. Art no longer 
had the faintest idea of the direc- 
tion in which he was moving. There 
was a faint odor of perfume, or 
perhaps of some kind of drug, in 
the car or clinging to the blanket. 
He told himself firmly that his new 
fears were ridiculous. Anyway, it 
was too late now to start having 
them. 

He crouched awkwardly beneath 
the blanket, breathing uncomfort- 
ably and pulling at his beard. Just 
let him have one chance to talk with 
Rita, face to face. She would not be 
able to stick to her mad plan. She 
had always gone along with him on 
the few occasions when he had really 
insisted on having something his 
own way. If she were able to face 
him with this decision, she would 



not simply have left him a note and 
fled. He had to believe that he 
would be able to make her change 
her mind. 

How could he have lived with her 
for more than three years and not 
know her any better than he did? 
But Rita didn’t know him, either, if 
she thought he would simply let her 
wreck her life this way. That was 
the important thing. The number 
of children and the legal problems 
were secondary. To save her was 
what he was really fighting for. 

The car turned, slowed, turned 
once more, crept ahead, and 
shortly stopped. 

“We get out here. Don’t look 
around, just go straight into the 
building.” 

The blanket was pulled away and 
Art saw that they were parked in an 
alley. Anonymous rough brick 
walls were close on either hand. As 
he got out of the car one of his es- 
corts turned him toward an open 
doorway, some kind of unmarked 
service entrance, in the rear of a 
sizable, dimly lighted building. 

One of his guides, a graying, 
tough-looking man, came along, 
walking a pace or two ahead of Art 
to show him the way. Art followed 
down a long shabby passage be- 
tween walls of painted concrete 
block and up a narrow flight of 
stairs whose carpet had begun to 
wear. The place was a run-down 
apartment building, or perhaps 
a hotel. This impression was 
strengthened as they traversed an- 



54 



GALAXY 




other passage, that twisted past 
closed and numbered doors. The 
building was certainly old, but rea- 
sonably clean and well-maintained. 

At last Art’s guide stopped and 
pointed to a door. “She’s in here. 
I'll come back in fifteen, twenty 
minutes, and we’ll take ya back 
where we picked ya up.” The man 
turned his back indifferently and 
walked away. 

Art tapped on the door, then 
turned the old knob and pushed it 
open. Rita was sitting with her 
back to him, in a worn plastic arm- 
chair, wearing a silvery bikni that 
sparkled in the light of ■-the small 
room’s single lamp, and staring out 
through the one small window at 
the night. She looked around, star- 
tled, at Art’s entrance, and he saw 
that above the bikni bottom her 
belly still bulged slightly with three 
months’ illegitimate pregnancy — 
he was not too late. As she recog- 
nized him, love and fear and 
defiance came into her face, and 
she jumped up from the chair. A 
second later she opened her arms. 



^^Iomh home with me now,” Art 
murmured, almost sleepily, 
about ten minutes later. His voice 
was half muffled by the single 
pillow on the small bed. Rita’s hair, 
spread artlessly on the same pillow, 
was silver and gold in the light of 
the cheap lamp, as it would be in 
the best.light anywhere. A gleam of 
almost the same color came from 



the plastic armchair, where her dis- 
carded bikni lay. 

“No, I can’t." Her voice was 
small but did not hesitate. “They’ll 
kill my baby if I do.” Unable to lie 
still after saying those unsettling 
words, she got up from the cot and 
went to close the window, against 
which rain was just starting to 
splash. 

Art also sat up and put his feet 
on the floor. He had suddenly 
realized that a good many minutes 
had passed, that his escort would 
soon be back for him, and that so 
far Rita and he had talked very 
little, and that mainly about how 
they loved and missed each other 
and whether Timmy and Paula 
might be much upset by what was 
going on. 

He stood up and reached for his 
codpiece, which had been thrown 
onto the armchair too. “You’re 
coming home with me, so don't 
argue about it. You haven’t com- 
mitted any real crime as yet, and 
there isn’t any reason why you can’t 
just walk out of here. A man from 
Family Planning came to see me, 
and from what he said I’m sure 
they won’t place any charges, if we 
just turn in this fetus as we’re re- 
quired to do.” 

“I can’t, I can’t. 1 wish you 
would try to understand. 1 wish you 
could stand by me.” Her tender 
body turned in the lamplight, 
naked and unprotected. His heart 
turned over. 

“Why can’t you do it, for sex’s 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



55 




sake?” he demanded, more savage- 
ly than he had meant. 

”B-because it’s living. It’s- my 
baby, and it’s part of you 1 have in- 
side me. It would be like killing 
you. Oh, Art.” Even slight preg- 
nancy always made women look 
ridiculous and she would look more 
so when she put the bikni on again. 
Why couldn’t anybody make 
clothes in which a pregnant girl 
looked less grotesque? Maybe such 
clothes were made somewhere. But 
then. Art realized abruptly, Rita’s 
pregnancy was probably going to be 
ended in one or two more days. One 
way or another. 

Now she got her bikni from the 
chair and did start to put it on. She 
looked fragile and vulnerable and 
ridiculous and he loved her tre- 
mendously. Her breasts were fuller 
than usual; that would be the preg- 
nancy, too, of course. 

“1 can’t go through this again,” 
she told him grimly, meanwhile 
working on a strap. “I’m g-going to 
have myself sterilized when this is 
over, even if the government 
doesn’t make me. But I can’t give 
up this baby who’s already here.” 
When Rita got very tired or upset 
she sometimes stuttered. 

“You have two real children, 
who need their mother with them 
right now, not away somewhere in 
one of those places that Family 
Planning runs, or hiding out here.” 

“You say they play all day in that 
b-blockhouse park. I didn’t have 
time to look around there much. Is 



it safe? Ann’s very nice but some- 
times she doesn’t watch her 
children closely enough.” By now 
she had gotten back into the bikni, 
and stood looking into the little 
mirror on the dresser, trying to pull 
and tug the bottom to a better fit. 

“Very safe." By now Art too was 
dressed. “Come on, Rita, you’re 
not killing any part of me by getting 
rid of a fetus. I’ll still be here.” 
“But not inside me. That part of 
you won’t grow anymore, or go on 
living.” 

“Bah. How do you know it’s even 
mine?” 

She did not answer, or look away 
from the mirror, but something in 
her face closed off. 

He said: “If I had a diseased ap- 
pendix you'd want it cut out and 
done away with.” 

“What’s growing in me is not 
diseased — ” 

“How do you know, have you 
had any defect tests made?” 

“ — and even if it were, I’d love 
it.” 

If this kept on he was going to 
grab her and shake her. “If you 
loved it — I mean, if you loved the 
potential child it might be- 
come — you know what I mean — 
you’d want to save it from a lifetime 
of being unwanted by the world.” 
“I want him. His mother wants 
him.” Now Rita was getting angry 
too. “We should kill him now be- 
cause he’s going to have a very 
tough time someday? Then I sup- 
pose we’d better not take any 



56 



GALAXY 




chances, we*d better knock 
Timmy’s and Paula’s heads in be- 
cause someday they’re likely to 
have a tough time too,” 

Sublimation! He knew that he 
was right, but where was the argu- 
ment to use? Not what the neigh- 
bors might someday say; that 
wouldn’t work with Rita. It came 
down really to their duty to the 
overcrowded world, of course, 
sacrificing a personal wish for man- 
kind in the abstract. For the good 
of mankind, everyone’s reproduc- 
tive urges, weak or strong, just had 
to bow aside. But those were not 
phrases with which to belabor one’s 
suffering wife. How to make the 
truth sound less self-righteous, 
speechy and highflown? 

There came a knocking at the 
door. On his way to answer. Art 
said over his shoulder: “You’re 
coming back to Ann’s with me now 
to get the children, and then you’re 
coming home.” 

“No, I’m not.” Stubborn as a 
mule, just like her sister-in-law. 
You might have thought the blood 
relationship was there. 

This time the knock was loud. 
Art reached the door and flung it 
open. The man who stood there, 
the same graying escort, looked at 
Art’s face and hesitated. Then, in a 
more respectful tone than he had 
used before, he asked: “You about 
ready to leave? Don’t worry, she’ll 
be outta here in a couple days,” 

“My wife is leaving with me. 
Now.” 



“I’m not going, Art. Don’t ask 
me — oh, I wish you hadn’t come.” 

A pair of young women were com- 
ing along the hallway, talking 
and giggling about something. 
They eyed Art strangely, and as 
they passed the doorway they 
glanced through it into Rita’s 
room, curiosity showing through 
the pale makeup that masked their 
faces. They were made up worse 
than the B-girls in the tavern had 
been, and dressed worse too, for 
those two wore loose shrouding 
robes, totally obscene draperies of 
brown and gray that no woman 
would wear except . except . 

“What kind of a place — ?” bark- 
ed Art, glaring wildly at the man 
who faced him in the hall. The man 
took a step backward, startled. 

Art turned quickly and confront- 
ed Rita. Lightning flared, twice, 
very bright through the window just 
behind her. In the repeated vio- 
lence of light Art could see the 
main front of the building he was 
in, Rita's room being evidently in a 
projecting wing, diana arms 
apartments, said a cheap new 
sign above the main entrance at 
ground level. Above, molded into 
the old concrete that arched above 
the entrance, were other words, not 
conspicuous but picked out now by 
perfect light and some trick of the 
speed-reading brain. 

CHICAGO MATERNITY HOSPITAL 
NURSES’ QUARTERS 

“What kind of place is this?” He 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



57 




grabbed at her, while thunder 
detonated. “Answer me, what kind 
of place?" He saw his hands shak- 
ing her, shaking Rita, with a vio- 
lence that no one should dare to 
offer her. 

Rita slapped him in the face. 
Never before. Art backed away 
from her slowly, as she began to 
cry. He backed up three steps and 
bumped into the man who had 
come to take him away and who 
now took a grip on Art’s arm. 
When Art tried to pull free, the 
man said something and only 
tightened his hold. Art turned in 
instant rage and struck out with his 
fist. The blow was clumsy but by 
chance he got most of his weight 
behind it and it took his enemy by 
surprise. Art felt human tissue 
yield with a crunch beneath his 
knuckles and then he was no longer 
being held. 

Now once more he had Rita in 
his grip. She was struggling with 
him, trying to break free. She 
screamed: “Do you think I like it, 
being here in a whorehouse? Do 
you know what 1 feel about any- 
thing? Let go!” 

Even in his rising madness he 
had no intention of hurting Rita. 
His only thought was to save her, 
get her out of here. After he had 
gotten her, screaming, out of the 
little room, there were frightened 
faces in his way, and doors, and 
scrambling bodies. All these were 
obstacles that must be pushed or 
knocked aside. Strong hands came 



from somewhere and fastened — on 
him. but he struck out blindly and 
kept trying to pull Rita free. Her 
being here was not to be endured. 

An expert foot tripped him, and 
down he went on a dirty floor. His 
arm was clamped and bent until he 
must let go of Rita’s wrist. Massive 
weights sat on him, crushing out 
what little of his wind was left. 

“Stop it!” a rough male voice de- 
manded. “Stop. You gonna stop?” 
It had been barking the same words 
at him for some time, and finally he 
had to listen. 

“Uh." 

A hand turned Art's face up 
from the floor. “In th’ name o’ pure 
chastity, you gonna behave?” 

“Yuh.” 

“All right, let ’im up. Sublima- 
tion, we get ’em all in here, every 
kind of nut there is.” 

The powerful hands that held 
Art down reversed themselves and 
hoisted, and without even trying he 
was on his feet. He was dizzy, the 
world was gray with his faintness. 
Unused to such exertions. Sweat 
and dirt were in his eyes, all mixed 
with helpless tears. His chest 
heaved in wind-broken spasms. 
There was a pain inside his shoul- 
der, where something seemed to 
have been torn. 

Rita’s voice was somewhere near- 
by, demanding: “Where is he? Let 
me see. Oh, the fool. If you’ve hurt 
him. I’m going to — to — ” 

“Oh, lady, please, he’s all right, 
see? Just his wind knocked out. He 



58 



GALAXY 




was out to tear the place apart. 
Look at my chaste eye, excuse th’ 
language, where he slugged me.” 

Good. 

Rita was visible as a blur before 
him now, and they were speaking to 
her with respect. Of course she was 
a boarder here, only a fugitive, not 
a — no, no, of course she was not 
that. He felt her cool hands, mov- 
ing on his hands and his face. 

“Don't start him up again, now, 
lady, please. Let us get him the 
purity outta here. We’ll see he gets 
home safe.” 

“Art? Oh, Art, forgive me. Are 
you all right?” 

“Come home with me.” 

“No.” 

He nodded. Then he was being 
led away. He no longer tried to 
resist. 

A man’s voice muttered: 
“Where’s the Holy Joe, why don’t 
he look after these celibatin’ people 
of his? I’m sick of the whole celi- 
batin’ mess.” Then the voice lower- 
ed itself to ask a whispered 
question. 

“No! Take ’im back where ya 
picked ’im up, and just leave him 
there, nice and safe. Is somebody 
usin’ the car now?” There was a 
fresh uproar in the middle dis- 
tance, men’s voices raised in some 
angry quarrel. “What’s that?” 

“Sounds like the homos again. I 
tell ya, we get every kind of a nut 
there is. Lemme put this guy in 
here for a minute.” 

The grip that had remained on 



Art’s arm guided him into another 
room. He was released and the door 
was closed behind him. He groped 
along the wall in darkness and 
found a switchplate, which in re- 
sponse to human fingers on its sur- 
face turned on a lamp. 

T he light was dim and his eyes 
were still befogged with tears 
and sweat, but he made out that 
the small room possessed a cot. He 
stumbled over and sank down on it, 
still wheezing for breath. He had to 
regain his wind, and more im- 
portantly his self-control. His 
strong point was supposed to be in- 
telligence, and so he had to think. 

Forget that Rita was staying in 
this whorehouse. Forget that the 
arrogant nameless obstetrician 
(Holy Joe, the bouncer had said — a 
cultist, then? One of Ann’s priestly 
friends?) was using this former 
nurses’ quarters of a doubtless 
abandoned hospital as his mater- 
nity ward. 

Remember this, seen in the 
fortuitous lightning flash: diana 
ASMS apartments. Let them use 
all the blindfolds they liked, now he 
could locate this place again. To 
what end? Should he tell all to 
Family Planning? Should he tell 
George in what sort of place his 
sister was holed up? George coming 
here to drag her out would likely 
kill somebody in the process, or 
they would kill him. Anyway, it was 
likely that her brother would let her 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



59 




stay here since she wanted it that 
way. 

The door of the room opened 
quietly, and a nude girl stepped in, 
carrying under one arm a bundle of 
cloth rulled up as Fred's karate 
outfit had been: Art blinked his 
eyes and found that he could focus 
clearly now. She was young and 
blond, flat-bellied and full-breast- 
ed, and her face was made up into a 
pale, cold mask. 

The girl closed the door behind 
her and then froze, motionless, 
staring at him haughtily. In a cold 
voice she asked: “Is this the right 
room? I don’t think it can be mine. 
What are you doing here? I don’t 
want men in my room.” 

Art shifted his weight on the cot, 
started to get up, and then when his 
body made its great reluctance 
known he let himself stay sitting 
there. He knew, he understood per- 
fectly well, that he should speak up 
without delay and tell the prostitute 
that for once she was indeed mis- 
taken. This one time she had 
actually, really, walked into the 
wrong room. He understood it per- 
fectly well yet he said nothing. Was 
it that he had not yet regained wind 
enough to speak? Was something 
wrong now with his throat? 

The girl now was moving away 
from the door, edging along the 
wall opposite where Art sat on the 
cot. Already she was gradually, 
unrolling the thick, opaque robe 
that she had brought in under her 
arm, and now she was beginning to 



cover her body with it. As she 
passed the switchplate on the wall 
she turned the room’s light to a 
cooler, softer glow. In her move- 
ment she gave the impression of 
trying to keep as far as possible 
from Art. She turned her painted 
face away from him, fixed in a 
mask of bitterness and contempt, 
while her motions, graceful as a 
dancer’s, expressed distaste and 
even fear. 

By now the robe was half un- 
rolled, and now it covered half her 
flesh. This girl was good, she knew 
her trade. “Don’t make a move 
toward me,” she said in a low voice, 
tense with raw repression. “I don’t 
want to be pawed by a man. I don’t 
want you even to stare at me.” 

In his adolescence Art had gone 
twice to brothels. Both times guilt 
feelings had hampered his perfor- 
mance, and the results had been 
unsatisfactory. He was still very 
nearly a virgin as far as sublimation 
was concerned. Since his marriage 
he had come to think of himself as 
grown above all that kind of thing, 
and he had never, since marriage, 
been seriously tempted toward it. If 
Rita had ever wanted to do any- 
thing like this, he hadn’t been 
aware of it. Did he know what she 
felt about anything? — those were 
her words. He would have done it 
with her. if she had ever asked. 
What went on between husband 
and wife was nobody else’s busi- 
ness. 

The girl had nearly reached the 



60 



GALAXY 




window now. “Maybe you don’t 
want to touch me, though,” she 
said, turning her eyes on Art as if 
with dawning hope. Oh, yes, this 
girl was good. “Maybe you’re a 
pure, chaste man. Maybe you’re a 
person who knows what a human 
being really likes.” 

She had reached the window, 
and now she turned her pale mask 
of a face to look up and out through 
the upper panes, left unshaded for 
this very pirrpose while the lower 
were fitted with plastic shields in 
imitation of stained glass. By now 
her body from the neck down was 
completely hidden in the long robe, 
and now her simulated fear and 
tension vtere fading out, were being 
put aside by something else. 

By an exaltation that, once he let 
it grip him, might be impossible to 
deny. 

“The stars,” she said, her voice 
now more distant and far softer 
than before. “The stars are very 
beautiful tonight.” 

Of course tonight's sky was all 
clouds and rain, and the stars were 
only a part of her routine. But that 
hardly mattered. In his mind the 
perfect blue-white points of light 
were there. Her voice and her face 
and the attitude of her body be- 
neath the long concealing robe 
made it all true. 

Again he realized dully that he 
must move and speak, he must ex- 
plain his presence here and make 
her stop. But for the moment he 
could not. His breathing, already 



slowed to normal, became still 
slower while his eyes rested on the 
girl. Her hair reminded him of 
Rita’s, and in other ways they 
looked something alike. This girl 
was physically quite attractive, as 
were all the most successful whores. 
The more lust there was to subli- 
mate, the more the act could mean. 
Of course nothing to do with sex 
was ever reducible to such a simple 
formula as that; but it seemed to 
Art that with this girl the meaning 
of the act of sublimation was likely 
to be very great indeed. To throw 
down the weight of sex and stand 
beside her, for the moment 
straighter, taller, freer, than that 
encumbrance would ever let you 
stand. To stand on top of sex, and 
use it for a footstool, and look with 
this girl at her imaginary stars and 
take their light into his being. To- 
night he yearned very powerfully to 
do just that. 

He knew it was a wrong and per- 
verse yearning that he struggled 
with, and once he had thought that 
such urges were over for him, all 
safely outgrown. But now in his 
weakness and defeat they came to 
trouble him once more. Well, since 
an act of sublimation promised all 
the comfort of which he stood in 
need, why not? Why not, just this 
once? 

No! He was not going to be so 
spineless, so weak-willed. Art re- 
sisted. He called up images of Eros, 
lust-knotted bodies sweating, 
writhing, roaring, raging to attain a 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



61 




pinnacle of lust yet higher than the 
one they slipped and labored on. 
He fastened his mind upon the 
remembered image of the girl’s 
bare body as he had seen it when 
she first entered the room. He 
pictured Rita’s body, spread out in- 
vitingly before him. But all the 
fleshly stirrings that he now manag- 
ed to arouse in himself would only 
go as fuel for sublimation if he 
faltered. And he was faltering. The 
consciousness of sex-as-God that 
never should entirely leave an 
adult's mind was flickering now 
and fading dangerously in his. 

“The stars are beautiful,” the 
girl said again, and now her voice 
sounded like winter bells. “So 
beautiful, so far away.” 

The rain drummed on the 
window steadily, but had no power 
to make her words ridiculous. Art 
feebly tried to cling to images of 
female nakedness, but all were still 
and flat and lifeless now, remote 
and meaningless as old photo- 
graphs. 

Just as he might have gotten up 
and gone to join the girl at the 
window, the thought presented it- 
self that the men would soon be 
coming back for him, and they 
would have quite a laugh if they 
came in and found him stargazing. 
The banal fear was enough to tip 
the balance on the other side. 

“I’m sorry,” he said, and stood 
up with a grunt. His hands and 
knees were quivering still and his 
wrenched shoulder hurt. He 



fumbled in his pockets for some 
money with which to tip the girl; 
probably she would make a fuss if 
he tried to walk out without tipping 
her. At least he seemed to recall 
that things had been that way in the 
brothels of his youth. “I’m not a 
customer.” 

She had turned from the window 
and was regarding him with great 
surprise. He handed her money and 
explained: “There’s really been a 
mistake.” Mechanically a gentle- 
man, he squeezed the girl’s breast 
through her robe. 

“Mistake? I’ll say!” The wintry 
voice had broken suddenly to nasty 
shrillness. “This is only five dollars 
you gimme!” 

“It’s all you’ll get,” said Art, 
now dangerously calm in his ex- 
haustion. “I told you I’m not a 
customer.” 

With the money in hand the girl 
rushed out of the room. Art follow- 
ed, wearily, as far as the corridor, 
where he stood waiting. In a mo- 
ment his guide, with a swollen 
cheekbone but the same indifferent 
expression as before, and another 
man, came into sight. “I’m ready,” 
Art told them. “Take me back.” 

He rode under the blanket again 
in the silent car, and smiled grimly 
to himself. Diana Arms Apart- 
ments. He was let out of the car at 
the busy intersection where he had 
been picked up. After all he had 
just been through, a late trip home 
by slidewalk seemed nothing at all 
to be concerned about, and he did

not even look around when once 
there came to him the sound of dis- 
tant screams. 

When he got back to the Parrs, 
who seemed to have been waiting 
anxiously, Art did not have a great 
deal to say. Yes, he had seen her 
and yes, she still wanted to go 
through with it. She seemed to be 
all right, and she said they were 
treating her well enough. 

“What kind of a place is she 
staying in?” Ann wanted to know. 
“And what’s wrong with your 
arm?” 

“I, ah, twisted my shoulder 
somehow, opening the car door.” 

Ann, evidently assuming from 
Art’s defeated attitude that he was 
now going to let his wife do as she 
chastely well pleased, became very 
comforting and motherly. Art let 
her rub his shoulder with some 
kind of medicine that George used 
for his occupational aches and 
pains. He also let her go on 
thinking what she liked. 

George appeared noticeably re- 
lieved by Art’s safe return. “I 
should have gone,” he muttered 
several times. 

No, you shouldn’t, thought Art. 
At last Ann released him and he 
dragged himself upstairs and fell 
into the guest room bed. 

In the morning, he decided pain- 
fully. he would go to Family 
Planning, and have a talk with Mr. 
Hall. There was really nothing else 
that he could do. 

Sleep was a long time coming. 



jtr. barnaby of the Homo- 
lYlsexual League is here ask- 
ing to see you, sir.” 

Oscar Grill, director of the Chi- 
cago office of the Bureau of Family 
Planning, slumped back in his 
chair and gazed unhappily at the 
image of his secretary in the inter- 
com plate. “What’s he here for? 
The same as usual, I suppose.” 

“I tried to find out, sir, but he 
was vague. I suppose the same as 
usual.” 

Grill made a grimace of annoy- 
ance. He had barely had time this 
morning to sit down and assure 
himself of what a busy day he had 
ahead, and now here came Barnaby 
again. About a year ago the presi- 
dent of the Illinois Homosexual 
League had begun a series of drop- 
in visits, coming around about once 
every two months. Barnaby came, 
and talked mostly in generalities, 
and sometimes they had lunch to- 
gether, and Grill had never been 
able to understand just what his 
visitor was hoping to accomplish by 
visiting. It wasn’t that Barnaby was 
personally attracted to him; that 
surely would have been made plain 
by now, and didn’t seem too likely 
anyway, given Grill’s paunchy, 
jowly appearance and the fact that 
he was sliding fast past middle age. 

What made the situation diffi- 
cult for Grill was that the president 
of the state Homo League was too 
important to be casually brushed

off. No politician wanted to risk 
alienating a bloc of votes of the 
League’s size, and Oscar Grill was, 
among other things, very much a 
politician. And general elections 
were coming up within the year. 

Grill sighed, ijientally trying to 
rearrange his morning schedule. 
He wondered which appointments 
he might be able to put off. “1 sup- 
pose you'd better send him in right 
away. Maybe 1 can cut it short.” 

“Yes sir." 

Seizing the moment of peace be- 
fore Barnaby walked through the 
door. Grill closed his eyes and tried 
to achieve an instant of total relaxa- 
tion. But his job was difficult, and 
his thoughts were hard to quiet 
quickly. He wanted to be sure to get 
to today's luncheon meeting, with 
the local heads of other bureaus, 
Art, Poverty, and Vandalism. Im- 
portant political decisions were in 
the offing. And sometime today he 
wanted to try to talk again with his 
semi-official contacts at the UN’s 
Chicago consulate, to try to find 
out what might be delaying the 
latest population forecast. There 
was a fog of rumors surrounding 
that report; probably when he did 
learn what it contained, he would 
wish that he hadn’t. 

The door was opening, and Grill 
opened his eyes and stood up and 
came around his desk, setting him- 
self to be courteous but still to ease 
his visitor out as quickly as he 
could. At least he had an obviously 
and honestly crowded desk for 



Barnaby to notice. 

The president of the Homo 
League entered, moving with his 
usual slightly feminine walk. His 
basic physique was that of an aver- 
age male, but his face was strik- 
ingly handsome — or perhaps 
pretty — and his long hair was a 
natural-looking bright red. In the 
League as elsewhere, appearance 
evidently counted for a lot in 
getting to be president. Barnaby 
wore a conservatively tiny bikni not 
too much different from the 
standard female model, the bottom 
lacking the exaggerated fullness of 
the usual male codpiece. Mr. 
Barnaby’s bra was functional; 
medical science had given him that 
much in the way of matching his 
biology to his lusts. 

“How do you do, sir?” Grill 
asked formally, extending a hand 
in greeting. 

“Not well today, Oscar, not very 
well.” Barnaby’s voice was husky 
rather than deep. He shook Grill’s 
fingers delicately. “1 am becoming 
afraid to travel through the streets. 
There is an organized harassment 
that I must endure. Good citizens 
pay taxes, then find that their 
government offers them no protec- 
tion.” 

Grill said: “Won’t you sit down? 
You mean you’re being picketed 
again by that bluenose group?” 

“Again? One might say that it 
has become almost continuous.” 
Adjusting his shoulder bag with a 
large hand, Barnaby settled himself

in a visitor’s chair. “Not only is our 
headquarters under seige, as it 
were, but some of these Young 
Virgins have taken to following my 
car through the streets. I should 
warn you that some of them have 
followed me here today.” 

Grill had seated himself and was 
toying with the corner of a stack of 
printout that lay awaiting his atten- 
tion on his desk, though he had 
little hope that the hint would be 
taken. “Well, I can certainly sym- 
pathize. I really wish there was 
something 1 could do but, twins, 
we’re sometimes picketed here our- 
selves." 

“Yes, I’m sure you are, and by 
many of the same people.” Barna- 
by crossed his hairless, slightly 
plump legs. “Oscar, it seems to me 
of the utmost importance that those 
of us who lead in conserving tradi- 
tional values should support one 
another, for the cause of Eros and 
the good of society. Men and 
women of good will should stand 
together whenever possible, that’s 
all I mean. I realize that you have 
no power to punish those wretches 
who are out there picketing.” 

“I certainly don’t.” Grill sneak- 
ed a look at his clock. 

“1 did go to the police about the 
picketing, as 1 believe you suggest- 
ed once before.” Barnaby seemed 
unable to keep from exciting him- 
self over the pickets. “1 tried to 
point out to the police the differ- 
ence between our country’s tradi- 
tional freedoms and the anarchy 



those bluenoses want. They paint 
their dirty words right on their 
signs, and wave them about in 
public places, and the police and 
the courts will do nothing to put a 
stop to it!” 

Grill shrugged. “1 suppose if the 
police are providing you with phy- 
sical protection, that's really about 
atl you can expect.” 

“Oscar,” said Barnaby reproach- 
fully. He leaned across the desk 
and lowered his voice. “Which is 
the more to be feared, injury to the 
body or poisoning of the mind? 
And 1 am more concerned for the 
youth of the community than for 
myself. What will happen to them, 
growing up in a world where 
nothing is considered obscene any 
longer?” 



art woke up slowly. There was 
something very nasty that he 
would have to face on waking, and 
so it was pleasant to delay the pro- 
cess. Then he moved, and felt a 
twinge in his shoulder, and all his 
memories of yesterday came back. 
With a groan he sat up in the guest- 
room bed. His watch read half past 
eight. 

His situation looked no better in 
the morning light than it had in 
midnight gloom. There was 
nothing for it but to be a good citi- 
zen and go to Family Planning. Mr. 
Hall had said they were not out to 
get anyone, at least not anyone like 
Rita. People like her were only the 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



65 




innocent victims of the midwifers 
and their gangs. And of their well- 
meaning relatives. Too bad if the 
relatives got in trouble. Art’s first 
responsibility was to his wife, not to 
the relatives who should never have 
gotten her into this mess in the first 
place. Even if Ihey were only trying 
to help. « 

He didn’t want to think about 
the Parrs right now, but it was hard 
to avoid while he was in their 
house. He got out of bed and began 
to get ready to go downstairs. 

While he showered and shaved 
and dressed he pictured raiding 
police breaking down the doors of 
that former nurses’ quarters, cart- 
ing off hysterical whores, handcuff- 
ing thugs. Then along came their 
quietly efficient lieutenant, leading 
Rita safely out. When she saw Art 
(who had ridden along in the lead 
car with the lieutenant) she burst 
into tears, and threw repentant 
arms around his neck . 

More likely she would slap his 
face again. The scenario was funda- 
mentally unconvincing, so Art had 
to give up on it and think of some- 
thing else while he held fast to his 
determination. 

Aromas of coffee and warm food 
now reached him in the upstairs 
hall. He promised himself that he 
would say nothing to the Family 
Planning authorities about George 
and Ann. Well, sooner or later he 
would doubtless have to say some- 
thing about them, for he was going 
to be asked a lot of questions. But 



he might make their immunity a 
condition of his giving information. 
Something like that. Anyway, he 
kept telling himself, if they wound 
up in trouble it would serve them 
right, for helping Rita get herself 
into such a mess. His shoulder 
definitely felt better this morning. 
He would get Ann to rub it with 
liniment again tonight, if he was 
still staying here. If she was still 
staying here. 

After taking a quick peek into 
the children’s room and finding it 
already deserted. Art went down- 
stairs. In the kitchen he found 
George and Ann facing each other 
across the breakfast table, where 
Art’s place was also set. Dirty 
dishes and a minor litter of garbage 
testified that the children had al- 
ready eaten before going out to 
play. 

Even as Art’s in-laws said good 
morning to him, they seemed to 
him to be exchanging guilty looks. 
They had provided Art and his chil- 
dren with food and lodging, but 
what did they count for, compared 
with the harm they were doing 
Rita? Their intentions had been 
good, of course, but what of that? 

George raised troubled eyes. 
“Art, what are your plans now?” 

“1 don’t know.” As soon as Art 
was seated, Ann began to ply him 
silently with toast and protein bars 
and coffee. His fingers fumbled on 
the jelly jar. He asked unneces- 
sarily: “Are the children out in the 
playground?”

He was assured they were, and 
with that an awkward silence fell. 
He wished he had gone straight out 
of the house, but that would have 
been insulting, and besides, being 
under a strain increased his ten- 
dency to get sick if he didn’t eat any 
breakfast. 

Still, he couldn’t stand to sit 
there. He gobbled his food and 
quickly pushed back his chair. 
'Tm going out." No one said any- 
thing to him as he fled the house. 

It was a bright warm morning; 
only puddles here and there gave 
evidence of last night’s rain. Once 
outside the blockhouse walls Art 
breathed a little easier, at least at 
first. As soon as he came to a public 
computer terminal he went in and 
obtained the address of the Chicago 
office of Family Planning. With a 
slight feeling of relief he saw that he 
would have to travel a considerable 
distance to reach the place; he 
needed some time to think over just 
what he was going to say. They 
weren’t out to get Rita, though, 
they were really on her side. Once 
on the proper slidewalk, he drew a 
deep breath, and again remarked 
to himself that the weather was fine 
today. Who cared? 

Reaching the Family Planning 
office seemed to take almost no 
time at all, and somehow he could 
get no constructive thinking done 
en route. The office occupied a 
new, fairly large building, one of 
the foothills surrounding the 
central Loop’s high range. From a 



block or two away Art could see 
that there was an unusually dense 
crowd gathered on the statwalk in 
front of the place. As he drew a 
little nearer he realized this was no 
ordinary pedestrian jam. There was 
a stack of placards on the pave- 
ment, ready for distribution; some 
kind of demonstration must be 
shaping up. Should he go on in? If 
he didn’t mike himself go in and 
face the authorities now, he never 
would. Ignoring the murmuring, 
jostling crowd as best he could, he 
pushed his way into the lobby. 

In the vast ground-floor lobby of 
glass and marble he approached a 
receptionist, a voluptuous girl who 
smiled at him enticingly from be- 
hind her desk. As befitted her place 
of employment she was very conser- 
vatively dressed, wearing only a few 
electrostatically clinging sequins 
and pads. 

Art halted in front of her desk, 
not as by the application of brakes, 
but as with a complete loss of 
momentum. This was it. He was 
finished. His mind had gone as 
blank and bare as the smooth ex- 
panse of receptionist’s skin con- 
fronting him. Somehow he had 
convinced himself that once he got 
this far all the right words would 
flow, but that had been a lie. -Now 
here he was, and all the words were 
gone in fear. To ask for Mr. Hall 
would be like leaping over a cliff. 

"I’m from California,” he began 
with a great effort, helped along by 
the girl’s encouraging eyes. “Still, I

have important business with you 
here. I’d like to see — the director or 
someone.” Art was suddenly and 
completely sure that he never 
wanted to talk to Mr. Hall again. 
He would never be able to convince 
Hall that George and Ann were in- 
nocent, or at least that they de- 
served a break, not after the tough 
time Ann had given him. And she 
and George hadn’t even asked Art 
where he was going this morning. 

The girl’s eyes turned grave. 
“The director is a very busy man,” 
she said. “If you’ll tell me the 
nature of your business, perhaps I 
can help you.” 

“My business is, uh, important.” 
Of course the director was not go- 
ing to see everyone who just walked 
in. One could hope that everyone 
here would be too busy for that. 

The girl’s eyes narrowed slightly, 
searching Art’s face. He had the 
idea that she could see his guilty 
knowledge, and was already 
pressing an alarm button hidden 
beneath her desk. “I can arrange 
for you to talk to a social worker. 
Are you in a hurry?” 

“I — ” When their computer 
learned his name it would give him 
to Mr. Hall, and Mr. Hall would 
seize upon him, not to be denied a 
single scrap of information. Art 
would stumble helplessly into a be- 
trayal of the Parrs, and Rita would 
hate him for that, even if she were 
not thrown in jail and forcibly 
sterilized herself. “No, there’s no 
hurry,” he told the girl. 



“May I have your name, 
please?” the receptionist pulled a 
computer-input slate toward her on 
its decorative coiled cable, and took 
up an electronic stylus. 

“1 — ” Ann was at this moment 
caring for Art’s children. George 
was risking bloody beatings from 
machines, to pay for safe block- 
house playspace and midwifers and 
cinnamon-flavored protein bars 
that tended to turn lumpy in the 
stomach. Art’s thought, now 
scrambling like a cornered animal 
for some way out, seized suddenly 
upon the possibility that Rita’s 
illegal operation was being per- 
formed this very morning. If so she 
would certainly be jailed instead of 
rescued if Art led Family Planning 
to her. 

In his present state he took this 
as excuse enough to flee. Without 
even delaying to pinch the recep- 
tionist goodbye, Art took a step 
back from her desk. He blurted out 
wild words about returning later. 
He turned and fled. 



46T1 ADICALS aT| d bluenoses, re- 
jVpressors of all that makes 
Man at one with a billion years of 
his animal heritage!” Barnaby’s 
voice had grown shrill. “Are we to 
abandon the youth of the world to 
them?” 



Looking down, with Barnaby, 
from an open window of his office. 
Director Grill had a good view of 
the wide slatwalk in front of the 
Family Planning building. Two

competing picket lines had just 
been organized down there, and 
both of them were on the march, 
weaving and writhing like antago- 
nistic serpents. The lines had 
formed with a healthy distance 
between them but were gradually 
being forced closer to each other by 
the pressure of a mass of onlookers, 
whose expectation of a riot was 
probably going to fulfill itself. It 
seemed likely to Grill, who had 
seen this sort of thing happen else- 
where, that a critical mass of active 
humanity would soon be reached. 
To carry the analogy with atomic 
fission further, a block away a 
column of helmeted city police was 
marching in, a damping rod about 
to be thrust into an ‘ overheating 
pile. 

Sporadic shouting drifted up to 
Grill's office window, but as yet he 
had seen no actual violence. He was 
not too high above the picket lines 
to tell that one of them was com- 
posed mostly of radical-looking 
young people, the girls wearing 
their hair long, the men short-hair- 
ed and clean-shaven, both sexes 
dressed in opaque garments that 
covered half their bodies or more. 
These of course were the Young 
Virgins, the objects of Barnaby’s 
wrath. In the opposing picket line, 
men and women of ordinary ap- 
pearance were in the majority, 
though there was a noticeable ad- 
mixture of men in biknis, and 
women in codpieced, translucent 
business suits.

"I see your League has some 
eountcr-picketers out today,” Grill 
commented. 

"Naturally we do!" Barnaby ran 
nervous fingers through his bright 
red hair. “We don’t intend to suc- 
cumb without a struggle." 

Grill decided that the time had 
come lor blunt ness, whatever the 
result might be. "Frankly, I wish 
you hadn’t decided on counter- 
picketing. Not in front of my build- 
ing." 

“What? But we must take 
action. Look, look down there! A 
sign that says ‘sublimate’, in big 
bold letters, being waved around in 
a public place!" 

Grill looked down and saw. He 
also saw another sign, in bigger, 
bolder letters yet: stop moral 
free fall. He wondered honestly 
which side that one was intended to 
be on. 

“Let them go to their monas- 
teries and lamaseries and nunneries 
to have that kind of freedom,” 
Barnaby was saying. “Let them go 
behind walls, away from the inno- 
cent. and do what they like.” 

Gi;ill drew a deep breath. “You 
know, if I was coldly logical about 
my job ..." 

"Yes?" 

“Well, I might look with official 
favor upon the bluenoses. After all, 
the less sex activity there is, 
generally speaking, the fewer preg- 
nancies and the less population 
pressure.” 

“Only in the most primitive so- 



cieties!” snapped Barnaby. But 
then he fell silent and put on a 
mask of careful control, which Grill 
thought was concealing more fear 
than anger. 

F.mboldcned by this. Grill went 
on: "I don't know if any society has 
ever been run on the basis of cold 
logic. Probably not. I'm sure ours 
isn't. People's emotional attitudes 
are the ultimate power, of course. 
And most of the people are with 
you. at least in your attitude toward 
bluenoses. If I were to come out 
strongly in favor of chastity today 
I'd doubtless be fired tomorrow.” 

Barnaby relaxed slightly. “You 
are joking. Of course there’s no ex- 
cuse for chastity. For a long time 
our League has shown the way 
toward the fullest enjoyment of sex 
without the slightest risk of preg- 
nancy." 

"Most people just don’t enjoy 
your kind of sex, though,” said 
Grill deliberately. “At least not as a 
steady diet. And the monasteries 
and other religious places you talk 
about are from my point of view 
very much like Homo League en- 
claves- they have a vanishingly low 
birth rate. So. I may not agree with 
the bluenoses emotionally, but I’m 
not going to try to put them out of 
business. I still don't dare to praise 
them publicly, but I can tell you off 
the record that I’m rather glad 
there are more and more lamaseries 
and nunneries these days." 

There was silence, except for 
Barnaby clearing his throat. He 



70 



GALAXY 




seemed to be giving some point a 
deep reconsideration. “Really,” he 
said at last, "l didn’t come here 
with the main objective of getting 
your help against the bluenoses. I 
know I let them upset me too 
much. I can see, they do help you in 
your difficult job. But we’ve helped 
you even more, haven’t we? For 
many years? 1 like to think that we 
in the League are your favorite citi- 
zens. so to speak. That there’s a 
large backlog of goodwill built up 
between us.” 

“Of course." Grill sighed, left 
the window, and walked back to his 
desk. He did not want to watch 
another riot. 

Privately, he had no more emo- 
tional sympathy for homosexuality 
than he did for chastity. Profes- 
sionally. he was glad to accept all 
the help, from every quarter, that 
Family Planning and the world 
could get. The human world was in 
danger of collapsing by the weight 
of its own numbers, though you 
might not be able to tell that by 
what went on in Illinois. 



O n the walls of Grill’s office the 
computer-drawn curves of the 
world demographic charts showed 
the danger in the form of the ever- 
worsening pressure of population. 
More people inevitably ate more 
food, and while around the world 
the food suppliers struggled to get 
ahead, sometimes they could not 
even manage to keep up. There 



were now laws restricting births in 
every country on the planet. It was 
mathematically* physically, inevi- 
table that at some future time, by 
some combination of peaceful or 
violent forces, the world’s popula- 
tion growth would finally be 
stopped— obviously it could not 
continue until human beings stood 
jammed shoulder to shoulder on 
evety square meter of solid land. 
The approximately eight billion 
people w ho inhabited the world to- 
day could all, in theory, probably 
be stored w ithin Chicago’s borders, 
standing indoors and out, leaving 
the rest of the earth on which to 
grow their food. 

Frighteningly many of the eight 
billion were hungry and sick today, 
and more would be tomorrow 1 . 
Science had boosted the world’s 
supply of available energy beyond 
all foreseeable needs by achieving 
controlled atomic fusion; by har- 
nessing, as the popularizers of 
science put it, the power of the H- 
bomb and of the sun itself. The 
problems of producing and distri- 
buting adequate food, and provid- 
ing medical care, were not so amen- 
able to research and engineering. 
The leaders of the have-not nations 
spent their time in power in states 
of chronic desperation, weighing 
and selecting gamblers’ moves to 
keep themselves in power and — 
sometimes this came first — to help 
their countrymen. 

One aid toward staying in power 
was to point out a scapegoat or two 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



71 




on which the people could vent 
their hate and dissatisfaction. If 
there were any justification for the 
choice of scapegoat, so much the 
better. Another gamblers’ move 
was the utterance of overt or im- 
plied threats. Often the threats 
were serious, even when spoken by 
the leader of a poor but desperate 
nation against a wealthy and much 
more powerful one. Today at least 
eighty nations were theoretically 
capable of producing atomic 
weapons, and fifteen or twenty or 
these had technologies sufficiently 
sophisticated to perhaps enable 
them to hide such outlaws weapons 
from the UN inspection teams. De- 
livery of a nuclear bomb could be 
accomplished by stealth if not by 
missile or aircraft. Biological 
weapons were easier to make, con- 
ceal. and deliver, and could be just 
as deadly if not as quick as nuclear 
blasts. Thus the voices of the 
have-nots must be heard in all the 
greatest capitals of the world. Thus 
if a new -born baby in Chicago con- 
sumed. statistically, three times the 
food of one new-born in India, it 
w as considered only just and decent 
to limit the number of new-born 
Chicagoans, and the same with 
Londoners, Muscovites, babies of 
Peking and Tokyo. The starving 
child in the Indian village might 
never see a bite of the food thus 
theoretically saved for him, but 
who could say it was not just to 
offer him at least a chance? Thus, 
even among the haves, compulsory 



sterilization and abortion for 
women who could not limit their 
fertility in any other way. Thus, the 
illegitimacy of the third child. We 
may not feed the world, we may 
lack the knowledge or the will or 
the material wealth for that, but we 
will not let it watch us overeat. 

Again, as he looked now at the 
charts, there darted across Grill’s 
mind the question of why the latest 
population forecast had been de- 
layed. He felt a foreboding chill. 

“It seems to me,” Barnaby was 
saying to him, “that in fact you owe 
us a real debt. Very few of the 
League’s members have brought 
any children at all into the world — 
as yet.” 

Something in Barnaby’s tone 
brought Grill’s thoughts back 
firmly to his office. “As yet? Why 
do you put it that way?” 

Barnaby did not answer at once. 
An alien hardness had come into 
his face. He continued to stand be- 
side the window, watching Grill. 

As Grill stood waiting beside his 
desk his mind started to relate that 
odd phrase “as yet” to the chain of 
Barnaby’s odd visits, and to certain 
other terrible hints that Grill had 
lately received from other sources. 
The hints concerned recent ad- 
vances in surgery, and in hormonal 
chemistry; until now, Grill had 
managed to avoid confronting their 
implications face to face. 

Barnaby, as if reading the direc- 
tor’s mind, was nodding slowly and 
solemnly now. “Maybe you’ve 



72 



GALAXY 




heard something about it? True 
male to female sex reversal is going 
to be possible. There’ve been doc- 
tors working on it in Sweden, and 
lately in Japan, and both groups 
seem to have been successful.” 
“Well. That’s fine. I suppose 
many members of the League will 
want to avail themselves of the 
operation, to become practically 
complete women.” 

“Not just practically, Oscar. 
Truly complete. I want that. Does 
that surprise you?” Paradoxically, 
as he spoke of becoming a woman, 
Barnaby looked more normal than 
before, a male trapped in a mas- 
querade costume he could not 
shed, a man grown weary and 
desperate beyond all words. “Does 
it make you laugh, to hear that I 
will want to bear a child? Two chil- 
dren, if 1 can.” 

Grill was far from laughter. 
“This is — beyond belief.” 

“Not to me.” Barnaby’s husky 
voice quavered. He spoke now as if 
confessing some terrible crime. 
“All my life, since I was a child my- 
self, the thought has been in my 
mind that somehow — if I could 
have a son — what do you know 
about me, anyway?” 

Like the first thunder of an unex- 
pected storm, the sounds of rioting 
burst up abruptly from the street 
outside; Director Grill hardly 
noticed them. He moved behind his 
desk and sank slowly into his chair, 
without taking his eyes off Barna- 
by. “So,” Grill said in a faint voice. 



“Today you have come here on 
business.” 



art, while inside the building and 
knotted in his own problems, 
had forgotten completely about the 
demonstrations being organized 
outside. When he emerged from 
the lobby, practically at a run, he 
was at once caught up between 
chanting swirls of picketers and 
counter- picketers. When he pushed 
his way free he had been turned 
around, and stood still for a 
moment, disoriented, in the middle 
of the statwalk. 

A short fat man carrying an arm- 
load of cheaply made, stick-mount- 
ed signs appeared at once beside 
Art, haranguing him. “Get yer 
sign, get yer placard here! Dp yer 
part, sir, only a dollar.” stop 
moral free fall, said the signs, 
or some of them at least. Others, 
interleaved, bore the proud legend 

LOVE CONQUERS ALL. 

“I’m not involved in this,” Art 
muttered, trying to get free of the 
peddler, not knowing which side 
the man thought he was on, or even 
what the two contending forces 
were. As soon as Art spotted a 
small gap between the picket lines 
he made for it. The pickets were 
chanting louder and louder, faster 
and faster, mouthing unintelligible 
rioters’ warcries. The peddler 
would not give up but stayed at 
Art’s side like a stubborn con- 
science, trying to sell him a sign. 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



73 




Moving together they were too big 
to get through the gap, and they, or 
Art at least, collided with one of the 
lines as it writhed snake-like to- 
ward him. A shout of anger went 
up from those ,he had bumped, 
followed by a cheer from the op- 
posing ranks. 

“Filthy censor! Bluenose!” 

“Smear the queers! Smear the 
queers! Smear^” 

A tall male figure loomed up in 
front of Art. Above the words 
STUDENTS FOR A CHASTE SOCIETY, 
handpainted on a dirty, opaque 
sweatshirt, the young man’s face 
was clean-shaven, angry, florid, 
shouting. Someone bawling a song 
about love pushed Art from be- 
hind, whereupon the young man in 
front struck Art on the head with 
his flimsy sign. 

Something was wrong, the blow 
should not have hurt so much. It 
was a great deadening bash that 
dented a vacuum into his skull, into 
which a tremendous pain was now 
about to rush . 

There was a policeman in view. 
And other people, he could not tell 
who . Art was down, but some- 
body had him under the arms and 
was dragging him along . the 
blow from the flimsy sign should 
not have been so hard . now he 
was dying, or else . 

IX 

after Art hurried out of the 
house, George and Ann re- 



mained seated at the breakfast 
table, alone now in the silent house, 
facing each other with glum expres- 
sions. 

“I wonder what’s happened to 
Fred,” said Ann distantly, turning 
her head to look out through her 
window at the patio vines. “And I 
wonder if Rita has her baby yet.” 
Then she gave up making conversa- 
tion and brought her hands up to 
cover her face. “Oh, if Art turns us 
in today it’s going to be all my 
fault.” 

“He won’t,” said George, 
putting into his voice a lot more 
certainty than he felt. “He doesn’t 
want to get Rita in trouble. Any- 
way, there’s no use blaming your- 
self if he does." 

“He might.” Ann spoke through 
her muffling hands, around her 
silver wedding ring. “You and Rita 
will be the ones who go to jail for 
conspiracy, but it’ll be all my fault. 
Why did I have to tell her you had a 
student who could arrange things? 
Some criminal doctor.” 

George was irritated. “Ham- 
mad’s no criminal, or I wouldn’t 
have him as a student. I don’t con- 
sider arranging for births to be a 
crime, and you don’t either. I don’t 
know of anything else he does that’s 
outside the law.” 

“He arranges births and breaks 
the law just for money. I don’t like 
that. Why couldn’t we have waited 
until I heard from the Order of St. 
Joseph people?” 

“You might have waited a long 



74 



QALAXY 




time, with their monastery burned 
down. Anyway, it might even be 
one of them who’s doing the opera- 
tion. I think it was smart for 
Hammad to farm it out." 

“Someone else is doing it, while 
he gets paid. Hammad, I don’t 
trust Hammad." 

“Now’s a fine time to tell me 
that,” George grumbled. “Anyway, 
Rita’s no Christian, she won’t care 
who does it or why.” As long as it’s 
done competently. If it isn’t — but 
there was nothing he could do. 

Ann was silent behind her hands. 

“Art won’t turn us in,” George 
repeated, trying to be comforting. 
To himself he thought that he could 
hardly blame Art for anything he 
did today. Art was the one they 
hadn’t allowed for in their plans. 

Still silent. 

He reached across the table, 
pried one of Ann’s hands down 
from its job of eye-hiding, and held 
it softly in his own. “Hey, things 
aren’t that bad,” he said. “Hey, 
lady, do you need some help?” 



T he first time he had made that 
offer to Ann they had both been 
aboard a bus cruising at eighteen 
miles an hour along the sixty-lane 
freeway that ran from Bear Canyon 
to Pasadena, near the middle of 
Los Angeles. Five apish young men 
had also boarded at Bear Canyon, 
though George had not paid much 
attention to them then. Perhaps 
they had gotten on to follow Ann. 



She had five or six small children 
with her that day. 

The five young men had taken 
seats just a little forward in the bus 
from Ann and her brood, and once 
the bus was isolated from the world 
in the flow of traffic they had begun 
talking loudly among themselves, 
boasting in obscene language of 
their skills at stealing, fighting, and 
sublimating. Ann was pretty good 
at ignoring them, but then one of 
the apes began to toss little wads of 
something or other in her direction. 
“Hey, lady, those all yours? Quin- 
tup-lets! Looks like you waited too 
long, decidin' which two to keep." 

By now most of the other 
passengers had congealed in their 
seats, seeing and hearing nothing, 
feeling safer behind pretended 
walls. 

“Hey, girly?” called the youth 
who had been tossing the spitballs. 
“Anyone ever tell you you’d look 
nice wrapped in a blanket down to 
your toenails?” He turned to a 
friend. “Red, you got some glad- 
rags with you?” 

“Sure.” 

“Break’em out. Girly’s gonna 
gaze at the stars with us.” 

An old woman sitting beside 
George muttered something to the 
effect that girls who dressed that 
way were just asking for trouble — 
and true enough, Ann had on an 
opaque blouse, and an opaque skirt 
that came down nearly to her 
knees. Maybe her dress was one 
reason why George had noticed her 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



75 




as early as he did. But that was 
irrelevant now. 

“Do you need some help, lady?” 
he called to Ann politely, as he got 
up to stand in the narrow aisle, 
swaying there slightly with the 
motion of the bus. George was then 
twenty-one, half trained in karate, 
proud owner of a purple belt. He 
stood up with a feeling of necessity, 
without either much fear or sense of 
heroism. Vaguely he wished that he 
could have a chance to limber up. 

“Yes, I believe I do.” Ann’s voice 
was as calm as if she had dropped a 
package in an awkward place and a 
presentable young man had offered 
to pick it up. 

So George cleared his throat like 
a nervous orator and faced for- 
ward. He met the eyes of the five 
troublemakers, one after another, 
and wondered if there were any 
words that he might stop them 
with. A wise old instructor had 
once told George that if you were 
really ready for street trouble the 
readiness showed somehow and 
trouble never came, not unless you 
went out of your way to make it, 
which wise people in or out of 
karate never did. What words 
would have stopped me, George 
wondered, when 1 was just a kid 
and up to something wild? But he 
had never been as wild and apey as 
these five were acting now, and 
magic words eluded him. At the 
same time he was reassuring him- 
self on a comforting point he had 
already noticed: the narrowness of 



the aisle. There might be five of 
them, but they could only come in 
reach of him one at a time. 

If they were going to come at all. 
He could see in their faces that he 
had frightened them just by getting 
up to face them, and he hoped that 
his continued calm and that of the 
girl might be enough to keep them 
paralyzed. He raised his eyes to- 
ward the front of the bus, and met 
the driver’s eyes in a mirror behind 
the driver's personal shield of 
armored glass. All around the bus 
the sixty-lane river of vehicles crept 
on, cutting it off from the rest of 
humanity and bearing it along. The 
driver was already trying to 
maneuver the bus into an outer 
lane and reach an emergency 
stopping bay, but to accomplish the 
maneuver might easily take ten 
minutes or so. 

Meanwhile, maintaining a calm 
silence was not going to be enough, 
perhaps because the five had no- 
where to retreat. Now their faces 
were hardening again; they were 
more afraid of something else, 
something that drove them on, than 
they were of him. They looked at 
one another and got to their feet 
and started after George. The old 
woman screamed. 

The eyes of the first youth to 
come at George changed again 
when he realized he was in a narrow 
aisle, and could expect no immedi- 
ate help. He was a boy of average 
size and strength, a little taller than 
George, sixteen or seventeen years 



76 



GALAXY 




old. His face was just a bit too 
broad to be called handsome, and 
his red hair was cut so short the top 
of his head looked bald. His cohort, 
mumbling obscenities, shoved for- 
ward behind him. pushing him to 
the attack, until there was nothing 
he could do but lunge at George, 
swinging his fists in clumsy 
desperation. 

The bus driver was thinking, as 
well as watching in the mirror. At 
that moment he tapped his brakes 
firmly, risking a bang from the ve- 
hicle following, but stalling the 
momentum of the single-file 
attack. 

George saw the first blow of the 
fight coming at him, and ducked 
just enough to catch it on top of the 
head, where an enemy knuckle was 
likely to be cracked. Then he 
leaned forward counterpunching, 
just as the sudden slowing of the 
bus rocked the enemy back on their 
heels. George could already crack 
tw o centimeters of pine with either 
hand. The foe went down like help- 
less dummies, tangled with one an- 
other as they fell. George pressed 
forward, hammering at the face 
and body of the unfortunate youth 
who had led the attack, getting him 
down and keeping him down so 
that the rest were jammed and 
pinned behind him and beneath 
him. 



W hen the police came aboard, 
only a couple of minutes after 



the bus had reached an emergency 
bay, they found George still leaning 
on the pile of inept apes, punching 
anything that dared to move. The 
police heard Ann’s matter-of-fact 
story, and the driver’s, and the 
stories of the passengers who had 
noticed anything happening. 
George was identified and allowed 
to go his way; the five were removed 
to a police copter. The red-bald 
youth had to be carried, and his 
face was now far from handsome. 
George had a moment of sick re- 
gret, but no more than a moment, 
on seeing the damage he had done. 

As soon as the police had de- 
parted with their catch the bus got 
rolling again and Ann’s reaction 
started to set in. Her hands were 
trembling and she had to fight back 
tears. She understood, probably 
from experience, that they would 
have done more than just wrap her 
in a plastic sheet. And the children 
riding w ith her were still in a slight 
state of shock, sitting quietly and 
staring at her and George. 

George sat down at her side and 
acknowledged her choking thanks. 
He now felt ten feet tall, and at the 
same time shaky with relief. “Re- 
lax, it's all over now,” he said to 
Ann. He patted her arm, and slid a 
hand beneath her long skirt, gently 
squeezing her thigh. 

"Please don’t," she murmured, 
shifting away from him, pressing 
her knees firmly together. 

His quieting pulse speeded up 
again at her withdrawal. But he 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



77 




couldn't believe she had meant that 
just the way it sounded. Probably it 
wasn’t really the open invitation it 
sounded like, but just a nervous re- 
action from the danger she had 
been in. A lot of people just didn’t 
feel like sex when they were fright- 
ened or upset, and under the 
circumstances her lack of even a 
polite pretense was quite for- 
givable. 

So he restricted himself to hold- 
ing Ann’s hand, and lightly strok- 
ing her arm, which attentions she 
accepted and seemed to find com- 
forting. "I think I know you,” he 
said with sudden mild surprise. “At 
least I know who you are. Your 
name’s Ann something, and you're 
in my sister’s high school class. You 
were there at school one day with a 
bunch of girls when 1 went to pick 
her up. She's Rita Parr. Oh, excuse 
me, my name is George.” 

“Yes, I heard you giving it to the 
police. I’m Ann Lohmann. Oh, 
why must I start blubbering now, 
when the trouble’s all over?” She 
was certainly not blubbering, just a 
little tense and swollen-looking 
about the eyes. “Thanks to you.” 
Getting herself completely unjjer 
control, Ann looked around to her 
children, giving them a smile and a 
few cheerful words, snapping at a 
boy to get his feet down off the seat. 

“Where are you taking them?” 
George asked. 

“We’re just coming back from 
Bear Canyon Park. I took them out 
there because so many never see 



anything but pavement and little 
strips of grass.” The kids all had a 
BI look. “They're from my Sunday 
School class.” 

“Oh, one of those religious 
schools?” 

“Yes.” There was a pause. “I 
remember seeing you, too, now that 
I think about it. Rita looks a lot 
like you.” 

He laughed. “Don’t say that 
about the poor girl. She’s all ex- 
cited about graduation these days. 
So are you, I suppose.” 

“Yes. we all are. I guess.” But 
Ann was evidently not nearly as ex- 
cited as Rita was. 

“And about going to college. 
Where are you going your freshman 
year, if you don’t mind my ask- 
ing?” 

“How could 1 mind your asking 
anything?” Ann smiled beautifully. 
She w as really quite a good-looking 
girl. “I might go to Mid-Cal my 
first year. Or maybe Ha-Levy 
Junior. I’m not sure.” 

George also liked this girl’s 
voice, now that he had a chance to 
listen to it attentively. Girls’ voices 
were important, in his estimation. 
So w ere their tempers and spirits. If 
there was a suggestion of repression 
in Ann’s clothes and manner, well, 
that was an attractive spice for him. 
He hadn't yet seen her standing up, 
but he guessed that she would be no 
taller than he was. That, too, was 
nice. 

“You’re older than Rita, aren’t 
you?” Ann was asking. “Well, 



78 



GALAXY 




naturally you are. Where did you 
go to college, or are you still 
going?” 

“1 didn’t go.” Not wanting her to 
think him lazy or stupid, he quickly 
added: “Oh, I may go yet. But the 
year I finished high school there 
was one problem after another in 
our family, people getting sick and 
losing jobs and all. We were almost 
back on BI. 1 didn’t have much 
time or money, and I was a little too 
dumb to qualify for any good 
scholarships. Then I got into this 
karate business. Once you get your 
black belt, it’s really a profession.” 

Ann looked at him warmly. “I 
can’t imagine that you're lacking in 
intelligence. Anyway, you've proved 
that you have courage, that’s more 
important.” She shook her head as 
if marveling. “When you stood up 
there in the aisle, 1 didn't know 
what you were going to do. But 1 
knew that you knew.” 

Unable to find the words to 
answer that. George changed the 
subject. “1 suppose you're all ex- 
cited about the Prom? Rita is. 
She's got her escort all picked out 
and everything. I don’t know if the 
poor clod knows about it yet.” 

Once more Ann seemed to with- 
draw for a moment, as she had 
when he caressed her leg. “I’m not 
going to the Prom,” she said, then 
busied herself suppressing a 
quarrel that had been developing 
among the children. 

George supposed that she had 
been having a quarrel with her best 



boy friend, and was uncertain 
about who her escort was going to 
be. He never doubted that a girl 
like this would have a choice of in- 
vitations to accept. “I’ll bet you 
change your mind about that,” he 
said, thinking back to the closing of 
his own high school days. “The 
Prom’s half the fun of graduating, 
or more than half.” 

She didn't answer. But surely a 
girl like this had been invited, so he 
could push and tease antf probe a 
little more without seriously hurt- 
ing any feelings. "Why," he said. 
“I'd be tempted to ask you myself, 
if I was in your class.” 

“I’ve been asked." Ann face was 
slightly averted so he could not 
make out her expression, but her 
voice was unhappily chilly. “I’m 
just not going.” 

Ouch. He had managed to hit a 
real sort spot after all. “Anyway,” 
he said, “your Prom isn’t next 
week. You have lots of time to 
think about it.' Meanwhile, when 
am I going to see you again?” 

I t turned out that he saw her 
next day, at the police station 
w here they had both been summon- 
ed for questioning about the fight 
on the bus. George came near be- 
ing charged with aggravated 
battery, but when the testimony of 
all the available witnesses had been 
heard, he was not charged. 

Later George bought Ann a 
snack in a nearby restaurant, and 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



79 




then suggested they find some place 
a little less noisy and copulate. 

“No. please. I’d rather not." 
Again her reply was blunt and 
seemed to amount to an open invi- 
tation to repression. But at the 
same time hei* answer seemed so 
natural and direct, so unembar- 
rassed, that he simply could not 
take it at face value. He told him- 
self that she had probably been up- 
set all over again by having to 
testify. She was so matter-of-fact 
about what she said that she prob- 
ably didn’t realize how it sounded. 

He asked her several times to go 
out w ith him on a regular date, but 
she consistently refused. Still, he 
contrived to see more of her. His 
sister Rita told him where Ann 
could usually be found on Monday 
nights, playing volleyball, and he 
went to the gym and managed to 
get in on some of the games. 

“Annie, this is fun, but how 
about you and me going out some- 
place by ourselves? You like other 
sports? Bowling, swimming? Or 
maybe a show.” 

“George, 1 . you’re nice, and 
I really like you, but I think it 
wouldn’t be wise.” 

“Why not?” But now people 
were yelling at them to get back to 
the net if they wanted to play. They 
never had the time or the place for 
a serious discussion. Ann seemed to 
be making sure of that. 

During this same period of a 
month or so George made it a point 
to enjoy sex with five or six different 



girls. With each, at the most aban- 
doned moments, he found himself 
closing his eyes and imagining that 
it was Ann Lohmann’s flesh that 
moved against his own. The 
popularizers of psychology on tele- 
vision and in the newsprints were 
always warning that such behavior 
could be a danger signal. To focus 
lust on one individual might be a 
step tow ard its repression whenever 
that individual was not available. 
Brilliant, thought George. It was 
just staggering how smart those 
college educated psychologists 
could be. Anyway, he wasn’t 
worried. A lot of the younger, more 
radical psychologists held that 
sexual repression, or all-out subli- 
mation even, did no permanent 
harm when practiced occasionally. 
That seemed sensible to George, 
though he hadn’t much personal 
experience to judge by. He was 
young and full of health and 
usually wanted to do nothing with 
his sex but satisfy it every day or so 
and enjoy thinking about it in be- 
tween times. 

But now this thing with Ann — 
this thing with Ann was something 

else. 

Early on the evening of the 
Prom — living in the same house as 
Rita, he could not possibly have 
gotten the date wrong — he obeyed 
an irrational-seeming impulse and 
phoned Ann’s home. Ann’s 
mother, tight-lipped and looking 
somehow hurried and harried, 
answered. When he asked for Ann, 



80 



GALAXY 




she reminded him in a nervous 
voice that this was Prom night. Still 
he noticed that she did not say in so 
many words that Ann had already 
left lor the Prom, or that she was 
too busy getting ready for it to come 
to the phone. 

After he had blanked off, George 
sat thinking. Then he went to 
Rita's room, where his sister was 
still being fitted into her Prom 
gown, meters and meters of fuzzy 
pink transparency. While their 
mother was out of the room looking 
for implements or materials of 
some kind, he took the opportunity 
to question his sister. 

“I really don’t know whether 
she’s going tonight or not, George. 
How does this look in the back?” 
“Fine.” 

“She's an honest girl and a good 
friend of mine and 1 love her 
dearly. If she said someone has 
asked her, then someone has. Also, 
if she said she's not going, then 
that’s the way it will be. I love her 
dearly, as I said, but I wouldn't be 
at all surprised if she doesn’t go. 
Oh, George, what do you mean it 
looks fine? I can tell in the mirror 
that it’s terrible.” 

He wasn’t looking into the 
mirror, or at the dress. 

Ineluctably motherly even on her 
Prom night, Rita came over to him, 
frowning with concern. “Oh, 
George, is it really getting serious 
between you two?” 

“It is for me, although I’ve never 
even screwed her once. Is she al- 



ways — like that? You know?” 

Rita was worried now, com- 
pletely distracted from her dress. “I 
might as well tell you bluntly, Ann 
has a bad rep with the boys in the 
class. I mean I'm not the most 
prudish and old-fashioned girl, but 
she is really way out.” Rita glanced 
at the bedroom door to determine 
whether their mother was still out 
of earshot. "You know she’s been 
excused from Erotic Orientation 
classes all along, on religious 
grounds. Don't get me wrong, she’s 
been niy loyal friend ever since 
sophomore year.” 

“No, I didn’t know that about no 
EO. But it’s not really surprising.” 
“You say you’ve never screwed 
her. If you ask me, no one has.” 
Rita nodded significantly. “1 mean 
it. She’s my friend, but you’re my 
brother. I’ve seen a lot of the boys 
displaying a certain interest in her, 
if you know what I mean. And 
more than one man teacher, too. 
Well, if she hardly ever lets them 
see anything between her shoulders 
and her knees, I suppose the men 
are bound to get the message and 
come sniffing around. I guess you 
know what you’re doing.” 

Rita was still looking at him 
worriedly when their mother 
returned and George withdrew. A 
deep excitement was now taking 
control of him. It had begun on 
that first day on the bus and had 
been developing ever since. He 
went back to his own room and 
spent half an hour alternately lying

81 




on the bed, pacing, and practicing 
his side snap kick before the 
mirror. Meanwhile he fought an 
inner struggle, understanding that 
the whole course of his future might 
be altered here and now. Again and 
again he told* himself to put dark 
ideas out of his mind and phone 
some other girl with whom he could 
joyfully and simply spend the night 
in bed. Then he gave up and 
started to punch out Ann’s phone 
number again. Then he gave that 
up too and headed for her house. 



T he house was all in darkness 
and he almost stumbled over a 
small figure sitting on a step in 
front of the door before he realized 
that anyone was there. Taking a 
second look, George saw that it was 
a boy about ten years old, who held 
in his hands a carved wooden figure 
about half as tall as he was. 

“You live here?" George asked, 
his hand hesitating over the call- 
plate on the door. 

“Yeah,” said the boy. “Nobody’s 
home but my sister,” he added 
gloomily. 

George’s heart gave a little pre- 
monitory throb. “It’s her I want to 
see.” He touched the plate and im- 
mediately a light came on above his 
head, giving the TV eye in the dodr 
a chance for a good look. 

In the new light George could see 
that the carved wooden figure in 
the boy’s hands was — or had 
been — a female nude, executed 



with some skill. The kid was slowly 
mutilating it now, moodily gouging 
and hacking it with a small knife. 
The step was littered with little 
chips and shavings. 

“Hey, what’re you doing that 
for?" 

“I carved it, 1 can do what I 
want.” 

“Well. What’s your name?” 

"Fred.” 

“I’m George. You can carve 
pretty good, Fred, if you did that. 
Why don’t you save it?” Though it 
seemed too late for that. Now one 
of the house's windows came alight; 
someone was on their way to answer 
the door. 

“Oh, you’re karate-George from 
the bus.” The boy looked up with 
interest for a moment, but then 
lowered his brown head again and 
dug in with the knife. “Why should 
1 save it? Nobody wants to look at 
it.” 

Ann opened the door, rubbing 
her dark hair with a towel. She was 
wearing a translucent pinkish sa- 
rong. not radically concealing, with 
apparently nothing under it. 
"Hello, George. Freddy! I thought 
you were at the Scout meeting. 
What are you doing, destroying 
that?” 

"Nobody cares about it.” 

“/ care. 1 told you I like to see 
anything you do — ” 

“You don’t know nothin’ about 
it. And nobody else cares.” Freddy 
flung down the chunk of wood and 
was gone running into the night.

across the little front yard and then 
swallowed up by the shadows along 
a narrow statwalk beside a slow 
river of taillights. 

Ann called after her brother in 
annoyance, but evidently without 
any real expectation that he would 
turn around and come back. She 
made a gesture of resignation and 
then turned. “Come in, George.” It 
was almost as if she had been ex- 
pecting him. 

“Thanks. Is your brother going 
to be all right?" 

"Oh, I suppose so. I think he’ll 
stay in the neighborhood. Anyway I 
don’t know what 1 can do.” 

George daringly omitted giving 
her any slightest pinch or caress of 
greeting, even on the hand or arm, 
as he stepped into the house. True 
to form, Ann did not blush or 
giggle at the omission, as most of 
the girls he knew would probably 
have done, nor did she take offense 
at it, as the really nice conservative 
ones might. A bad girl then, as Rita 
had warned him, and all the signs 
so plainly showed. But still . 
somehow he couldn’t believe she 
was. 

"Let’s go out beside the pool,” 
she said. “It’s nice outside to- 
night.” 

“All right.” He followed her 
through the house. “I called ear- 
lier, and your mother sort of im- 
plied you were going out, but I just 
had a hunch and came on over any- 
way." 

“I’m glad you did.” As they were 



leaving the indoors for a palm- 
fringed patio Ann stopped and 
turned to him. Her gladness, if 
such it was, was quiet and almost 
melancholy. "My parents have 
gone to the Prom, they agreed to be 
chaperones. They were very upset 
w hen they found they couldn’t talk 
me into going, even going at the 
last minute w ith them instead of a 
boy taking me. My mother is 
Church of Eros, you know, quite 
devout, and she's been going there 
for guidance day after day and try- 
ing to get me to go. But her church 
and mine just don’t agree. My 
father went to his playclub and 
talked to the philosopher. Finally 
my parents both decided they ought 
to do what’s expected of them even 
if 1 won’t. So they’re chaperoning. I 
guess that’s partly why Freddy is 
upset. He thought Dad might go 
with him tonight to some Scout 
meeting.” It was about the longest 
speech that George had ever heard 
from her. She seemed farther from 
melancholy when she had gotten it 
out. 

“I’m glad your parents decided 
that way,” said George. “Now I 
have you all to myself.” 

"I’m glad you do. 1 had to talk a 
little bit to someone.” Ann stopped 
rubbing her hair and let the towel 
hang down in front of her. She 
seemed innocently unconscious of 
the concealing effect. Now for the 
first time she smiled. “Would you 
like a swim. George? I just climbed 
out." 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL 



83 




"Sounds like fun.” He followed 
her around the bend of the 
L-shaped patio to the pool, which 
was irregular in shape and fairly 
small, and bordered along most of 
its perimeter by plastic grass and 
probably artificial flowers. His 
mind pictured Ann climbing from 
the pool, slipping on her sarong, 
going to answer the door. Suddenly 
he w as sure she had been swimming 
in the nude, and his inward excite- 
ment— if excitement was really the 
right word for this chilling thing — 
went up another reading on the 
dial. Of course there was no sen- 
sible reason why a girl alone should 
not slip off her bikni and swim 
nude if she wanted to. Only the 
most satyrish reactionaries would 
insist that a solitary person wear 
clothes to emphasize his or her sex. 
But still the mental picture of Ann 
floating alone, smooth as a snake, 
divorced from sex, all chaste and 
bare as a lily-pad, was overwhelm- 
ing. 

“Still, the air is getting a little 
cool now,” said George, stalling. 
Standing beside her on the edge of 
the pool, he felt very unsure of him- 
self. Would she laugh at him for an 
old-fashioned clod if he mentioned 
his lack of a swimming codpiece? 
On the other hand, if he just 
stripped bare and dove in, would 
she, after all, be shocked? In spite 
of the evidence of her own words 
and actions he couldn’t really be- 
lieve that she was the bad kind of 
girl. But hadn’t he come here to- 



night hoping she was, trying to 
prove it, wanting to get from her 
w hat only bad girls gave? Confused 
as a sixteen-year old, he chickened 
out. 

“You’re right,” she said calmly. 
“1 wasn't in the pool for very long.” 

They sat down side by side on the 
pool's curved grassy edge, and 
George pulled off his sandals and 
dipped his feet into the water. In 
his knitted translucent shorts and 
jacket he was really quite warm 
enough, but he saw Ann shiver just 
slightly in her sarong with the 
damp towel around her bare shoul- 
ders. In a minute he would suggest 
that they go back inside where it 
was warmer. Meanwhile he wanted 
to watch her as she stirred the water 
gently with one toe, scattering a 
thousand California stars. 



O nly once, as an adolescent in 
the grip of a way-out mood, 
had George visited a brothel. There 
a pretty girl had draped herself 
while he watched, and had talked 
about stars and purity and poetry 
and other high, mysterious things 
until she had him sexless as a 
mushroom. Then he and the girl 
had lain chastely side by side on her 
narrow bed and talked. Between 
other topics of conversation he tried 
to explain the mental processes of 
karate to her, how the mind could 
concentrate the body’s force suffi- 
ciently to drive the hand uninjured 
through a wooden slab. At the time 



84 



GALAXY 




he had not really started any 
serious study of karate, and so he 
had been facile with explanations. 

Probably his dissertation hadn’t 
made too much sense, but the girl 
was a skilled listener. He supposed 
most whores were that, and 
sexually desirable, too. He had 
heard Japanese speculating about 
what the old-time geisha must have 
been like, and he wondered if they 
were something similar. In the 
brothel George had never forgotten 
how desirable the girl with him 
was, while at the same time his 
mind had daringly pushed lust 
farther and farther away. A door 
had opened for him to a bittersweet 
world of controlled power. Change 
the metaphor: free style sparring, 
and Eros’s feet of fleshy clay were 
swept out from under him, and 
down he came with a great ignomi- 
nious gonad-jarring crash, to be 
made to bend his neck before a 
single rebellious human slave. 

Still, when it was all over, when 
his half hour was up and he was 
being expertly shown the door, he 
found himself somewhat disap- 
pointed. Was this all that sublima- 
tion ever amounted to? It hardly 
seemed worth the fuss that people 
made about it. 

Now, sitting with Ann on the 
grassy rim of the pool, he watched a 
movement of her hips show through 
the sarong as she shifted her weight 
slightly, and felt a sudden physical 
surge of desire for her. He remem- 
bered suddenly that he had seen 



and responded to just such a move- 
ment of the prostitute’s body as she 
began to wrap herself before him. 

“So. I guess you’re still working 
with that Sunday school religious 
class, hey?” 

“Oh, yes. When I have time.” 

“Have you belonged to that 
Christian group long? I mean, 
guess the rest of your family aren’t 
members.” 

“It’s a Christian school, but . .” 
Ann spoke slowly and carefully 
now. “I’m not actually baptized 
into the Church yet myself. I just 
help out there. I’ve been hanging 
around the school and church there 
since I was about thirteen. You’re 
right, my parents are much against 
it and of course they try to argue me 
out of ever being baptized. I guess 
my adolescence has been difficult 
for them, with me always hanging 
around Sunday school instead of 
going to young peoples’ orgies in 
their church. The philosopher at 
Daddy's playclub says I’m looking 
for a crutch to help me get through 
life. And really it is such a tremen- 
dous step, being baptized, I mean. 
In a sense I’m still free now to do 
anything I want, but after baptism 
1 won’t be.” 

"Hm,” 

“For example I’ll be practically 
restricted to marrying someone 
who’s also a Christian. If I get 
married at all.” 

“Really?” 

“Well, I just mean it takes an 
awful lot of work to make a mar- 



LOVE CONQUERS ALL

riage a success even when the two 
partners agree on the important 
things such as religion. And my 
marriage will have to succeed be- 
cause Christians don’t have 
divorce, or at least not very often.” 
‘‘Aren’t they divided into a 
bunch of splinter sects? I was read- 
ing about it the other day." George 
had rarely given the subject of re- 
ligion much thought, but just 
recently he had been reading up a 
bit on Christianity. He didn’t think 
it was for him. He couldn’t figure 
out whether violence was ever 
allowed or not. Maybe it was some- 
thing like the traditional rules of 
karate, where you weren’t allowed 
to use it for real unless to protect 
yourself or another loved one. 

"Christians used to be divided. 
Now they’re pretty much reunited 
again, what's left of them.” 

“Well, I never even go to Church 
of Eros any more. I think religion’s 
not for me. They say that some of 
those churches, once you join them 
they never let you alone again after- 
wards.” 

After a little silence Ann said: 
"There are a number of things that 
never let you alone.” 

“Yes,” agreed George, wonder- 
ing just what things she had in 
mind. 

“George?" Her voice was 
different. 

“What?” 

“Would you like to have sex with 
me? Here and now?” 

“Why, yes,” he answered, speak- 



ing mechanically in his surprise. 
“That would be nice.” 



F or long seconds she did not re- 
ply. She sat there so motion- 
less that her toes no longer troubled 
the starry water. George tried to 
read her face in the near-darkness. 
Then abruptly she turned her face 
aw ay. “The way you say that!" Ann 
said, and made a frightened, 
twisted sound that was a little like a 
laugh. 

“It’s just that you took me by 
surprise." George slid closer to her 
along the side of the pool. “Oh, 
Ann. Annie? You've never wanted 
me to give you an erotic touch be- 
fore." 

"Oh." she said, “I’ve wanted.” 
She leaned away from him, supple 
and graceful in her sarong. Her 
toes left the water with a tinkle of 
tiny drops, and she stretched out on 
her back along the edge of the pool. 
Now she covered her eyes with one 
slender wrist. 

George could no longer control 
himself. He crept very close and 
bent over Ann, daring not to touch 
her at all. “Don’t be afraid,” he 
said. 

“|’m not afraid. I’m not 
ashamed." Her voice was surpris- 
ingly firm and proud, and she was 
watching him from under her arm. 
"You don’t know me very well, 
George. But maybe you’ve heard 
some stories." 

“Yes 1 have. But I don’t care if 



86 



GALAXY 




I lie stories are true." 

"What do they say about me. the 
stories (hat you don’t care about?” 
“They say — " His voice went 
shaky on him and he had to pause. 
"What they amount to is that 
you're still a virgin." 

She moved her arm away and 
now he could see her face in the 
starlight, her lace becoming calmer 
now with an inner change, the 
blooming of some beauty that 
George could not have named. 
"Yes.” She said it without a trace 
of shame. “That’s why I’m not at 
the Prom tonight. Nothing but one 
long orgy. George, just now I 
offered you my virginity. Can you 
understand what that means to 
me?" 

Watching her, listening to her, 
he thought he could. As if following 
some biological imperative his lust 
now began to recede, while at the 
same time there rose up in him — 
something else. His throat ached 
with his joy. He straightened up so 
that he was no longer bending over 
Ann but sitting at her side. 

Looking at him steadily, she 
asked again: “Now, do you want to 
have sex with me?” 

“Yes. Sometime. Right now I 
want— something more.” 

Ann nodded agreement and 
lowered her eyes. Her breathing, 
that had quickened momentarily, 
now grew slow. In a gentle voice she 
asked: “Shall I take this sarong 
thing off? Or put on something 
thicker?” 



George could not find his voice to 
answer right away. What had 
happened in. the brothel had af- 
forded him an enjoyable, way-out 
kick, a fancy kind of reverse mental 
tickle. That tremendous gulfs of ex- 
perience lay beyond had been 
suggested, but no more. In itself 
the visit to the whore had been not 
quite worth the effort to repeat it. 
This thing impending now, be- 
ginning now , was going far beyond. 
A winged thing had been born in- 
side his chest and it was lifting at 
the roots of his being, lifting and 
pulling and expanding until it 
seemed that sex itself might be dis- 
solved out of the flesh and carried 
outward to the stars. 

"Oh. I don’t care what you 
wear,” George groaned in a failing 
voice. "Oh. I love you, love you, 
love you. Oh. sublimation’s such a 
dirty word, there has to be a 
belter." 

“I know." Ann whispered. 
"Don’t talk now." She had done 
this before. He w as the virgin here. 

Their hands came together and 
held, now just human hands more 
than they were male-female. She 
raised her eyes to his, and then on 
past his eyes, and he knew that she 
was looking at the stars. No turning 
back now'. Never. They rose on the 
great lifting wings.

and intermittent and instinctive 
struggle. Art understood from the 
beginning of the struggle that he 
was sick, or hurt, and paradoxi- 
cally this left him less worried than 
he had been before. Before what- 
ever had happened to leave him in 
this state. He was less worried be- 
cause now less would be expected of 
him. They would have to take care 
of him now. 

. they? Someone was trying. 
However he had come to be here, 
he lay in a bedroom in somebody’s 
home. In one of the two beds 
crowded into the small and cheaply 
furnished chamber. He had the 
vague impression of somebody 
having been in the other bed, and 
the covers there were rumped, but 
now when he looked carefully there 
was no one. Perhaps, too, some- 
body had once shared this bed with 
him. He should have been polite 
and pawed at their genitals at least 
but right now he felt tired of 
genitalia and thank Eros he was 
sick or hurt and nothing much 
could reasonably be expected of 
him along that line. 

. should have grabbed and 
pawed as those little plastic figures 
were doing to each other, those 
cheap Church of Eros icons that 
someone had shoved to the rear of 
the top of that high plastic ward- 
robe over there and then forgotten. 

It was a BI bedroom from the 
look of it, or could it be a room in a 
cheap hotel? Or some rented room 
where tenant after tenant rushed 



through, forgetting and leaving 
things, and none of the haphazard 
objects in the room fit with any- 
thing else. There on the wall was 
the founder of Christianity nailed 
up, as in Ann’s children’s room, 
but here two pieces of plastic were 
doing the job instead of wooden 
beams. And there on the other 
wall, a reproduction of a painting 
that looked like a Caravaggio, but a 
Caravaggio that Art had never seen 
before. Nothing like Eros tramp- 
ling the violin, or Bacchus lounging 
amid bowls of fruit. In this picture 
there were men around a table 
doing something, counting money, 
and on the right two men entering, 
one of them important, a mys- 
terious figure of light and shadow 
and power, extending a hand that 
said: here, you, enough of playing 
with those trifles on the table, more 
important things are waiting. The 
summons had come, and everyone 
in the picture knew about it except 
the man for whom it was intended. 

... so he himself was sick, no, 
he was hurt, for now he remember- 
ed something about being frighten- 
ed out there in the street, and now 
there was this sexawful pain in his 
head that only intermittenly would 
go away. And now truly there was a 
long-haired girl resting, indecently 
covered, in the room’s other bed, 
and now, whup, a trick of the il- 
lusionist’s art and she was gone 
again. Meanwhile it might have 
been that Art had slept. 

Standing before him was a man.

tall and narrow-shouldered, with a 
sandy beard and impressive green 
or gray or blue eyes, it was hard to 
tell because the color seemed to 
change, who looked at Art intently. 
And this man was a somewhat 
familiar figure, because he had 
been standing in the same place an 
hour ago (a day ago?) and asking 
Art some questions. 

“What’s your name?” the man 
asked now, looking at Art intently. 
He had a mild, slow voice that con- 
tradicted' a look in his eyes of being 
fierce and concentrated and some- 
how ready to pounce. 

64 A RTHUR Rodney? 

_^^The man smiled and nodded, 
as if this were very good news in- 
deed. He had shut the door of the 
room behind him; outside some- 
where in the background printout 
was clacking noisily from a com- 
puter terminal in need of mechani- 
cal adjustment. “Art, what year is 
this?” Art’s second correct answer 
was just as satisfying as his first. 
"How do you feel. Art?” 

“Not good. I’ve got a triplet of a 
headache.” All of a sudden the 
lobby of Family Planning came 
back, and then the frantically wav- 
ing picket signs outside, the jam of 
bodies on the statwalk. What 
should come after that? He didn’t 
know. He had reached a real blank. 

The man stepped closer to his 
bed. “Let’s have a look at that.” 
With what were unmistakably a 



doctor's hands, professionally sure 
and gentle, he probed through or 
around some kind of dressing on 
Art’s scalp. 

"Ouch.” 

“Sorry. Well, that’s not looking 
too bad. And I'm glad you’ve 
waked up fully now.” The man 
stepped back, pulling at a curl of 
sandy beard. “But 1 still want to 
make an X-ray or two. Haven’t 
been able to as yet.” 

“How long have 1 been here? 
And where am 1, anyway?” 

“You’ve been here several hours. 
Let’s say you’re with some people 
who gave you shelter when it 
appeared to them that otherwise 
you’d go to jail. May 1 ask — what is 
the last thing you remember 
clearly?” 

Art closed his eyes. His head 
throbbed. “Coming out into the 
street, in front of the Family 
Planning building. There was some 
kind of demonstration, or riot . 
but why should 1 have gone to 
jail?” 

The doctor shrugged and gave a 
tiny smile. “I don’t know that you 
would have. Some of the Young 
Virgins on the scene evidently mis- 
took you for one of their own 
casualties and brought you here. 
Some of them think that if a person 
gets clobbered in the street he must 
be a good guy, and anyone who’s a 
good guy is automatically in danger 
of being thrown in jail.” 

He approached Art again, and 
with the aid of a tiny light looked

closely into his eyes. 

"How am I doing, doctor?” 
“Not bad, not bad. Rest. It’s im- 
portant that you take it easy for a 
while. Don't worry about a thing. 
I'll be back in a bit.” 

When the door had closed 
behind the doctor Art lived in sil- 
ence tor a while with the pain in his 
head, alternately opening and clos- 
ing his eyes. Somewhere in the 
distance the faulty computer 
terminal clacked away again. The 
room had one small window with 
bright daylight coming in around 
the edges of a closed shade. This 
was some Young Virgins’ refuge, 
then. But he was not back in the 
Diana Arms; at least. Rita’s room 
had looked very little like this one. 

The door opened and a girl in a 
long, opaque sweater came in, 
bringing him a cup of something 
w arm and chocolatey to drink, and 
Art w as abruptly conscious of being 
entirely naked beneath the bed- 
sheet. 

"Medicine?” he asked, while 
routinely starting to put a hand up 
under the bottom of her sweater. 

“No.” She gave him a cool smile 
and turned away, so that his hand 
slid free. "Just a drink. Thought 
you might like some.” 

She went out again right away. 
The stuff in the cup tasted good. 
Soon he might try getting up. He 
wondered if his clothes, and his 
watch and his money, were in the 
plastic w ardrobe, and he wondered 
what time of day it was. About the 



lime he had finished the drink, 
sipping slowly, the doctor was 
back. 



H e looked in Art’s eyes again 
with his little light and then 
pulled up a chair and sat. "Art, I 
look the liberty of going through 
your wallet while you were uncon- 
scious. Just to see if there was a 
record of anything, diabetes or 
allergies or so forth, that might 
bear on your medical condition.” 
"No doubt I owe you thanks for 
taking care of me. And you found 
out my name. I didn’t catch 
yours.” 

No answer. 

"I suppose now I had better get 
up and put on my clothes and 
leave." 

"1 don’t want to scare you. Art, 
but before you go walking out on 
the street 1 must insist we take 
some X-rays. 1 hope to be able to 
make them downstairs here in just 
a few minutes. If X-rays show no 
skull fracture we can drive you 
home right away, take you any- 
where in the city you want to go. If 
they do show a fracture we are 
going to have to somehow arrange 
to move you on a stretcher to a 
hospital." 

“I — see. Or maybe I don’t.” 
“The point is that your presence 
puts us here in something of an 
aw kw ard position. If you do have a 
fracture, we can’t simply call an 
ambulance to come and get you.

And for your own good I wouldn’t 
want you riding folded down and 
blindfolded in the back seat of a 
car.” 

“1 know how that works,” Art 
muttered, feeling a little sick. 

“Beg your pardon?” 

"Nothing. Evidently I’m in some 
kind of a — secret hideout.” 

The doctor looked relieved. “I’m 
glad you understand. It’s quite im- 
portant to a number of us here that 
the location of this house be kept a 
secret. And we've realized by now 
that you’re no sympathizer of ours. 
Nevertheless we wish you well. We 
don’t want to — to make you feel 
you’re being held a prisoner. As 
soon as the X-ray film 1 need ar- 
rives. which I hope will be any 
minute now, we’ll take a couple of 
pictures and then you'll be on your 
way.” 

Art relaxed wearily in the bed. 
“All right, all right. I guess you 
know what you’re doing.” 

“I’m really glad you’re being 
understanding about this. Art. I 
feel a personal responsibility in this 
matter. For your being in the 
Family Planning office to begin 
with, I mean.” 

Art looked at him, trying to 
puzzle it out. 

“You see, I’m Rita’s midwifer.” 



A couple of sturdy male Young 
Virgins came along shortly, 
pushing a regular hospital cart. 
They got Art’s clothes out of the 



wardrobe — he noticed the strap of 
his watch sticking out of a pocket, 
and also the faint bulge of a billfold 
that had evidently been scrupu- 
lously replaced — and helped him 
put on his codpiece and loaded him 
onto the card beneath an opaque 
sheet. Meanwhile, of course, he 
was demanding again and again to 
be told where his wife was. 

“She's not here, not in this build- 
ing," the doctor kept answering 
him calmly. “The parturition will 
bequitesoon. She’s well. And she’s 
worried about you — more precisely, 
as I interpret what she says, she’s 
worried about whether you’ll want 
her back when she has her third 
child." 

It took Art a moment to under- 
stand. “You mean she thinks I 
might divorce her? But that's fool- 
ish, how would that help? It 
wouldn’t help her or the children, 
and it certainly wouldn’t help me.” 
He lay on his back with his head on 
a low pillow as the two husky Vir- 
gins propelled the cart out of the 
room and along a rambling hall- 
way, through what appeared to be 
an ancient house of mansion size, 
or else perhaps the rundown dormi- 
tory of some private school. Not at 
all like the Diana Arms. “Sure, I 
hope she doesn’t have a third baby 
when she comes back. But even if 
she does, 1 most certainly want her. 
So, you’re the one who’s doing it. 
How can you interfere in people’s 
lives like this? How much are you 
being paid?"

The doctor was walking beside 
the cart, now and then going ahead 
or tailing behind when the way be- 
came too narrow. “I’m not getting 
a dollar from Rita or anyone in her 
family. If she’s paid out money it 
must be going to fhe doctor who re- 
ferred her to me. or to someone else 
along the line. In a clandestine 
business like this you’re always 
going to get some people going into 
it for the money." 

“And you?" 

"For the good of my immortal 
soul. That's how I see it. That I 
have an inescapable moral duty to 
do what 1 am doing here.” 

The cart rolled into a small, old- 
looking elevator. The two orderlies 
remained behind as the doors 
closed and the elevator started 
down w ith Art still lying on the cart 
and the doctor standing beside it. 

“You don’t inspire a great deal 
of confidence, doctor. If you are a 
doctor, really. If you’re not you’d 
better keep your hands off my 
wife.” 

“I assure you I am an obstetri- 
cian. And you’ll be glad to hear 
that I haven’t lost a mother in some 
years of practice.” The slow 
descent of the elevator stopped and 
the doors slid open. “I haven’t lost 
anyone to a head injury, either. But 
then yours is about the first I’ve 
treated since I was an intern.” And 
with that the cart was rolling again. 

The opaque sheet came over 
Art’s face in two thicknesses as they 
left the elevator. The voice of his 



captor said: “I’m covering your 
eyes up here, so you won’t be able 
later to identify or locate this 
house." 

Art only grunted. He felt the cart 
jolt lightly over a threshold, and 
then there came a whiff of outside 
air, summer-warm and fragrant, 
but he stoically refused to look or 
listen or sniff for clues. Once before 
he had been granted knowledge 
that secretive guides were trying to 
withhold from him, and knowledge 
had done him no good at all. This 
game was hopeless, for him at any 
rate, and he was about ready to give 
it up. Not to accept that his op- 
ponents were in the right, but to 
admit that they had him beaten. 
The law and the bulk of society 
were on his back but he could not 
call them in. When you went into 
the endgame a rook down and your 
clock running out, maybe you had 
better resign and save some mental 
energy for the next game. There 
would be a lot of tough games to 
play against the world when Rita 
came home again, whether or not 
she had to go to jail first or not. If 
she w ent to jail who was he going to 
get as a steady, dependable baby- 
sitter in California? 

Now the cart was on a descend- 
ing ramp. Impossible to judge 
whether it went down one meter or 
three. When it stopped and the 
doctor pulled the sheet down from 
Art’s face, the two of them were 
alone in a kind of laboratory or 
treatment room crowded with a

jumble of shelves and boxes and 
equipment, lighted by some old- 
fashioned overhead fluorescents. 
The windowless walls were lined 
nearly from floor to ceiling with 
shelving, loaded with boxes and 
bottles labeled in what seemed to 
be the jargon of medical tech- 
nology. The nearby door through 
which they had evidently just 
entered was now closed. It was hard 
to guess the size of the room be- 
cause sections of it to both right 
and left were cut off by portable 
w hite screens. 

"Now where is the damned 
film?” The doctor was ruffling 
through stacks of papers, journals, 
printouts, and other impedimenta 
that covered a large desk-like metal 
table. “They told me that they left 
it here.” Somehow the archaic 
swearword, the like of which Art 
had not heard since the tridi play 
went dead on the tube train, 
sounded natural coming from this 
man. 

After fruitlessly searching a few 
moments longer, the doctor 
muttered an excuse and went out 
impatiently, closing the door of the 
room behind him. Art heard 
another door open and close some 
distance off. 

Apart from his continuing head- 
ache. he now felt pretty good. Good 
enough to have a sense of awk- 
wardness and vague shame at lying 
here on a cart like an invalid. He 
raised himself on an elbow and 
looked about. There on the foot of 



the cart were his clothes. Should he 
dress and stagger out into the 
street, calling for the police? That 
certainly wouldn’t win Rita over to 
his point of view. No, he had tipped 
his king and resigned the game. 

Near at hand he recognized a 
portable X-ray machine, a familiar 
sight from visits to other physi- 
cians’ offices. An unobtrusive 
background hum of electric power 
and electronics permeated the 
room. And now he became aware of 
another sound, an old-fashioned 
watch tick-tick-ticking, except this 
was a little faster and more irregu- 
lar than a watch would be. 

Still alone. Art swung his feet 
over the side of the cart and sat up. 
His head ached, but he felt able to 
stand and walk. Now if that was a 
bathroom over there, as a tiled 
interior glimpsed beyond the top of 
a white screen seemed to promise, 
then his physical comfort might 
soon be brought back close to nor- 
mal. He slid off the cart and walked 
around the screen, past glassy 
tanks and a maze of piping and a 
portable computer terminal set up 
on a dimly lighted workbench, and 
found the hoped-for toilet. 

He was on his way back to sit on 
his cart like a good patient when, 
just rounding the shadowed work- 
bench, he came to a full stop. 
“Ah,” he said aloud. 

The fetus was in the central 
glassy tank atop the bench .

BLACK HOLES AND COSMIC CENSORSHIP 



as I write this, California courts 
are trying to decide whether 
the police have the power to seize 
copies of the film “Deep Throat” 
and my friend Earl Kemp may be 
headed for jail due to violation of 
censorship laws. Thus I’m tempted 
to write about censorship. But since 
this is a science column and not a 
political essay 1 don’t suppose I’ll 
be able to. 

However, one should never 
underestimate the ingenuity of a 
columnist .... 

I suppose, though. I’d better 
stay with science and cosmol- 
ogy. I’ve just got the latest on gravi- 
tation research; that seems like a 
good safe topic. I mean, how far 
from censorship can you get? 

I expect most Galaxy readers are 
at least vaguely aware of the on- 
going research on detection of grav- 
itational waves, but it won’t hurt to 



summarize a bit. In the Newtonian 
universe, and in many other 
theories as well, gravity is a “force” 
that acts through a field. That is, 
these theories postulate that al- 
though gravity is 10;40 times 
weaker than electromagnetism, it is 
not fundamentally different. 

This essential similarity holds 
true in the realm of special rela- 
tivity also. Special relativity, you'll 
recall, states that no material ob- 
ject and no signal can travel faster 
than light. There’s a good bit of evi- 
dence for special relativity, and no 
really good counter-theory lurking 
in the wings to take its place. 

The general theory of relativity, 
however, is another breed of cat en- 
tirely. There are several contenders 
in that realm, and experimental 
evidence offers no clear-cut way to 
choose one or the other. General 
relativity does away with gravity 
fields altogether. In that theory. 



94 





gravity results from the geometry of 
space. 

Whether gravity fields “exist” or 
merely result from geometry, 
theorists believe gravitational at- 
traction propagates with the speed 
of light. Thus, if matter be 
created — or destroyed — the rest of 
the universe won’t be instantly af- 
fected, but must wait until the 
gravitational effect, traveling at 
light speed, reaches it. 

Thus “gravitation waves”, which 
will have a frequency and an ampli- 
tude much like light, but .which 
may also have some rather strange 
properties as well. 

I n theory, if we could detect and 
examine gravitational waves, we 
might be able to tell whether they 
result from a field and are thus 
similar to magnetism, or if they are 
merely a property of space and its 
geometry. Unfortunately, gravity is 
an incredibly weak force. It re- 
quires the mass of the whole earth 
merely to pull things with a puny 
980 cm/sec2 acceleration — and we 
can overcome that with rather 
small magnets, or chemical 
rockets, or even our own muscles 
when we jump. 

Because gravity is so weak, it’s 
hard to play with. You can’t turn 
on a “gravity wave generator” and 
fiddle with the resulting forces to 
see if they refract, or can be tuned, 
or whatever. You can’t wiggle a 
mass to generate gravity waves, be- 
cause you can’t get a large enough 



mass held into place to be wiggled. 
It’s not even possible to blow off an 
atomic weapon, turning some 
matter into energy, and measure 
the effect of the matter vanishing; 
the effect is just too small to be 
noticed, and it's hidden among the 
rather drastic side effects. 

However, there are a number of 
theoretical ways that gravity waves 
might be generated by the universe: 
stars collapsing into black holes or 
neutronium would do it, for 
example. The universe might be 
riddled with gravitational waves, 
but they’d be terribly weak, and re- 
quire delicate and sophisticated 
apparatus to detect them. 

Some years ago. Dr. Joseph 
Weber of the University of Mary- 
land decided to build a gravity wave 
antenna. He took a large aluminum 
cylinder and covered it with strain 
gauges. The idea was that so long 
as the cylinder were acted on only 
by the steady gravity of earth, it 
would be in a stable configuration; 
but if a gravity wave passed 
through it, the cylinder would be 
distorted, and the strain gauges 
would show it. 

He had to compensate for 
temperature, and isolate it from 
vibration, and worry about a lot of 
other things, but the technology 
had been developed: the antenna 
was built. It was incredibly sensi- 
tive, able to detect distortions on 
the order of an atomic diameter. It 
was also able to detect student 
demonstrations outside the library, 



95 




trucks rumbling along the highway 
a mile distant, and other unwanted 
events. 

The solution to the latter prob- 
lem was simple: build another copy 
of the antenna and place it 1000 
kilometers away; now hook the two 
together, and pa'y no attention to 
an event that doesn’t affect both. 
Such “coincidences” should be due 
to a force affecting both antennae, 
and since even earthquakes take 
time to propagate — and their 
effects move much slower than 
lightspeed — the output should be 
reliable. 

Unfortunately, it isn’t as straight- 
forward as that. The instruments 
must be very sensitive, and thus 
there’s a lot of chatter from them. 
By the laws of chance, some of this 
chatter will be simultaneous, or 
near enough so, and thus you are 
guaranteed some false positive 
results. The output of the gravity 
wave detectors, therefore, needs 
careful analysis to decide what's 
real data and what’s chance. 

Weber immediately got results. 
He got a lot of results, far too many 
for chance. Unfortunately, there 
were far too many for cosmologists 
to believe; as a result of Weber’s 
early reports some cosmologists 
estimated that as much as 98% of 
the universe must be inside black 
holes. 

The argument went this way: 
something is producing gravity 
waves. We can’t see enough matter 
to account for the events, but 



normal matter falling into a black 
hole would produce gravity waves. 
Therefore — 

There were other cosmologists 
who wanted to believe this for 
different reasons. Readers familiar 
with black holes must excuse me: 
it’s now necessary to discuss their 
basics for a moment. 

A black hole is a theoretical con- 
struct that can be derived 
from both general relativity and the 
older Newtonian universe; in fact, 
the first speculations about black 
holes come from La Place back in 
1798. If you take enough matter 
and squeeze it small enough, you 
will eventually get so much gravi- 
tational force that nothing can pre- 
vent the matter from continuing to 
collapse. 

In Einsteinian terms, the space 
around the matter becomes curved 
into a closed figure, but the result is 
the same: the matter is squeezed to 
infinite density. Long before it 
reaches that state, though, there is 
a region around the matter at 
which the escape velocity is greater 
than the speed of light. 

The effect of that should be 
pretty obvious. If light can’t 
escape, you can’t see into the hole. 
Moreover, anything that goes down 
in the hole stays there: that is, if 
you accept the speed of light as the 
top limiting velocity of the universe, 
nothing can come out, ever. 

The area at which space is curved 
into a closed figure — or the region 



96 



GALAXY 




at which the escape velocity is equal 
to the speed of light — is known as 
an event horizon, and interestingly 
enough both Newtonian and 
Einsteinian equations give the same 
location to it. 

It is the region at which: 

R = 2GM 

2 

c (Equation one) 
where R is the radius from the 
center, G is the universal constant 
of gravitation, M is mass, and c is 
the speed of light. For our sun, that 
radius is on the order of two kilo- 
meters: if the sun is ever squeezed 
that small, we’ll never be able to see 
it again. 

An observer diving into the black 
hole would never know when he 
had crossed the event horizon. He 
could continue to send signals ‘to 
his friends outside, and as far as he 
could tell, they would go right on 
up and out. 

Those outside the hole, though, 
can never under any circumstances 
receive information from inside it. 

Now, as it happens, if we 
measure the total amount of matter 
in the universe, and plug that in for 
M in equation one; and we take the 
furthest object we can observe and 
plug that in for R; then the equa- 
tion almost balances. 

Almost, but not quite. There 
isn’t enough matter in the universe; 
we’re missing from 20 to 90% de- 
pending on whose figures you use 
for M and R.

If the equation were to balance, 
space would be curved into a closed 
figure at the boundaries of the uni- 
verse, and we’d live in a closed uni- 
verse. 

Eventually, in a closed universe, 
those galaxies receding from us will 
stop and come back, and the whole 
universe will be packed into a big 
wad at the center. What happens 
after that is debatable, but a 
number of cosmologists want badly 
to believe in a closed universe. 

It also means, of course, that we 
live inside a black hole ourselves: 
that is, our whole universe is a 
black hole. 

If we don’t live in a closed uni- 
verse, Ihe receding galaxies will go 
right on receding, and this disturbs 
some theorists. Thus, Weber’s co- 
incidences were welcome in many 
cosmological circles. Others tried 
to build gravitational antennae to 
confirm his results. 

T hen a second startling result 
came out of Weber’s shop. It 
appeared that there was a 12-hour 
sidereal cycle to the coincidences, 
and furthermore, that this cycle 
was related to the galactic plane. In 
other words, gravitational waves 
originated in the galactic center*. 

We have a good estimate of the 
distance to the galactic center, and 
thus were able to estimate how 
large an effect at the center of the 
galaxy would be required to deliver 
that much force to us out here on 
our spiral arm. The result was once 



again dismaying. Far too much 
energy was apparently being turned 
into gravitational waves. 

Now the energy radiating from 
the galactic center could be either 
sprayed out in ali directions, obey- 
ing the inverse square laws, or it 
could be “beamed” into the 
galactic plane. Obviously less total 
energy is involved if it is “beamed”, 
but what mechanism might 
account for that? 

The speculations were many, 
imaginative, and varied; they were 
also rather frightening. 

I et's take a moment to go back to 
j black holes. When matter gets 
dense enough to satisfy equation 
one, and the event horizon forms, 
things don’t just stop there. The 
matter goes on collapsing; we just 
can’t see it any longer. 

In fact, nothing can stop the col- 
lapse. In theory, the matter should 
quite literally become infinite in 
density. This is a troublesome con- 
cept: how can infinite density be 
present in a finite universe? The 
answer is obvious: in some respects, 
the matter no longer remains in the 
universe at all. 

When gravitational forces have 
got to this point, we have what is 
known as a “singularity;” a point 
at which normal laws simply do not 
apply. 

Actually, things are worse than 
that. Not only don’t normal laws 
apply, but the relativity equations 
suggest that no laws apply. Strange 



98 



GALAXY 




things happen in the region of a 
singularity. Time is reversed. Con- 
servation laws don’t work. Caus- 
ality is a joke: if you could get into 
the region of a singularity, you 
really could go back in time and 
assassinate your grandfather. 

In fact anything could happen 
and science ceases to exist; and you 
don’t even have to physically go to 
the singularity for this to take 
place. If you can observe one 
directly science has just gone down 
the drain. That bothers a lot of 
theorists and scientists, and rather 
disturbs me as well. 

If there is a naked singularity — 
that is, a singularity not covered 
with an event horizon — then, at 
least in potential, there is no order 
to the universe. 

Out of that might come ghosties 
and ghoulies and things that go 
bump in the night. 

W hat then may we do to save 
science? Why, invoke censor- 
ship, of course. (I told you never to 
underestimate the ingenuity of a 
columnist.) 

The kind of censorship invoked 
is called rather whimsically the 
“Law of Cosmic Censorship”, 
which states that “There shall be 
no such thing as a naked singu- 
larity.” All singularities must be 
decently clothed with an event 
horizon. 

Given cosmic censorship, a 
number of interesting laws about 
black holes may be demonstrated: 



that they never get smaller, that if 
one is rotating it can’t be sped up 
until the escape velocity is smaller 
than the speed of light, and a 
number of other rules that are 
collectively known as the laws of 
black hole dynamics. 

Unfortunately, cosmic censor- 
ship deprives science fiction writers 
of some of their best stories. Hmm. 
Cosmic censorship is unfair to 
SFWA ... 

It does it this way. If all black 
holes are covered with event 
horizons, it follows that you can’t 
plunge into a black hole and come 
out elsewhere or elsewhen. Actually, 
if you plunge into a random black 
hole, all that could ever come out 
anywhere would be a stream of un- 
differentiated subnuclear particles; 
for all their fantastic properties, 
singularities do retain one feature, 
namely that gravitation in their 
region is rather high, sufficient to 
disassociate not only the molecular, 
but the atomic, structure of any- 
thing visiting them. 

On the other hand, if a star 
about to collapse into black hole 
status is rotating fast enough, some 
solutions to the Einstein tensor sug- 
gest that the singularity formed will 
be a donut; you could dive through 
that and come out in one piece, 
provided the donut were large 
enough. 

Large enough means galactic 
sized. I’m afraid; stellar size black 
holes will still get you too close to 
the singularity so that you can’t use

them for transportation. Further- 
more, what you come out to on the 
other side is not, according to the 
equations, our universe at all. 
What it will be like, no one can say, 
except that it will have in it a copy 
of the black hole you dove through 
to get there. 

So, turn around and dive back, 
of course; but that doesn’t work. 
You go through and out again, all 
right, but into a third universe 
different from either of the other 
two. The black hole is still there, so 
try again — and come out in a 
fourth, and there behind you is that 
rather tiresome black hole again. 

Is any of this real, or are we play- 
ing with ideas? No one really 
knows, of course. The most we can 
say is that the people who can solve 
Einstein tensors come up with that 
kind of result. 

It’s rather discouraging for 
science fiction writers. Here we 
thought we had a new way to get 
faster than light travel, what with 
black holes connecting us to an- 
other universe, or, just possibly, to 
another region of our own, and the 
very people who gave us the black 
holes go on to prove we can’t use 
them. 

Still, maybe there’s a way out. 
Perhaps someone will find a solu- 
tion. But they can’t so long as the 
law of cosmic censorship is 
enforced, because singularities de- 
cently covered with event horizons 
can’t come out and affect our uni- 
verse. 



B ack to Weber and gravitation 
waves. One of the models con- 
structed to account for the enor- 
mous gravitational energy generat- 
ed in the center of the galaxy had a 
very large singularity lurking down 
there. Suns fell into it, and as they 
were eaten, gravity waves poured 
out. It was a rather depressing pic- 
ture, our galaxy being eaten alive 
like that. 

Then a number of other labora- 
tories constructed gravitational an- 
tennae. Bell Laboratories, an Eng- 
lish group, the Russians, all made 
gravity wave detectors. In each case 
their equipment was supposed to be 
an improvement on Weber’s. 

None of them found any coinci- 
dences at all. People began to 
wonder just what Weber had done, 
and to doubt his results. 

Last summer, at the Cambridge 
Conference of experimental relati- 
vists, the picture changed again. 
The people who had built “im- 
proved” gravity wave antennae re- 
ported no results whatever. 

(Weber continued to report re- 
sults, but with a change I’ll get 
back to in a moment.) 

Meanwhile two other groups, one 
at Frascatti, Italy, the other at 
Munich, Germany, had built 
carbon copies of Weber's antenna. 
They got coincidences. Whatever 
Weber was observing, others have 
independently observed something 
similar now. 

While all this was going on 
Weber did a re-analysis of his coin- 



100 



GALAXY 




cidences — using a computer rather 
than human judgment to define 
just what was a coincidence. The 
result was startling. He still gets 
events — but they are no longer con- 
centrated in the galactic plane. The 
sidereal coincidences have gone 
away, and with them has gone the 
evidence for the large singularity 
eating the galaxy. 

Moreover, Dr. Robert Forward, 
of Hughes Research at Malibu, 
California, has constructed his own 
gravity wave antenna. Since lasers 
were invented at Hughes Labs, it's 
no surprise that Forward’s antenna 
employs them. He has three big 
weights at the apexes of a 
right-angle triangle. 

Lasers measure the precise dis- 
tance of each weight from the 
others. A gravity wave will pre- 
sumably distort that triangle, and 
thus be detected. 

Forward has “events” too. They 
seem to coincide with the kinds of 
things Weber gets but, as I write 
this, no serious attempt has been 
made to compare results. 

For that matter, the Munich 
people have just got started. They 
were quite surprised, by the way; 
they’d thought Weber’s results 
were some kind of artifact. 

I t appears, then, that some kind 
of gravity waves do travel about 
through the universe; at least some- 
thing that can affect large alumi- 
num cylinders hundreds of kilo- 
meters apart is operating here.

The next step is to see if these 
events have any relationship to 
those bursts of x-ray energy de- 
tected by Vela satellites that I told 
you about a couple of columns ago. 
At the moment that's not possible, 
and of course there are a lot more 
gravity wave events than x-ray 
events; but if the x-ray events are 
accompanied by coincidences on 
the gravity antenna, we’ll know a 
lot more about both. 

We may then be able to decide 
what gravity is: a force, or a distor- 
tion of geometry. We may be able 
to learn more about black holes, 
and what happens inside them, and 
who knows, those trips to alternate 
universes could be a real possi- 
bility. 

Until we get rid of cosmic censor- 
ship, though, we’ll never know 
what happens to the volunteers who 
go exploring down black holes. 



A STEP FARTHER OUT

didn’t put the pseudopear into her 

stew. 

We’re too small a group to be 
constantly afraid of each other, 
though. Anyone might have been 
the next victim, if Nadi had died, as 
we tried to stretch our dwindling 
food supply. But Nadi threatened 
our very survival, psychologically as 
well as physically, and I can’t 
blame whoever tried to put her 
away. Sometimes I wish it had been 
me; I might have done a better 
job . 



E ight of us manned a small 
booster station and switchyard 
on Ingeborg, handling n-space 
traffic in this end of the Arm. We’d 
crossed eighteen light-years of 
space to get here, from the closest 
transit station then operating, the 
in corpora passage taking six weeks 
subjective time, and nearly twenty 
years, relative time. Once here, we 
dug foundations, assembled the 
works, set up prestressed shells and 
topped them with five meters of 
packed earth, one on each side of a 
handy drumlin which gave opti- 
mum separation of transmitter and 
receptor. Within a month, plains 
grass tufted the insulating dirt; 
four years later, the only visible 
signs of our presence were the 
power guidepoles and the conveyer 
belts like licking metal tongues 
from pursed, green mouths. This 
area had glaciated at least once; the 
solar-still purified water from a 



stream that snaked through low 
hills haphazardly dumped across 
the landscape toward a lake gouged 
out by some anciently retreating 
mass. It’s purely beautiful; pretty 
soon we camouflaged everything, 
trying to pretend we lived on a re- 
sort planet with occasional inter- 
ludes of necessary labor. This was 
easy to do, since our living quarters 
were minimal, Ingeborg’s weather 
being on the heavenly-subtropical 
side, and our station being small, 
with minimal mechanization. We 
even shuttled cargo from receptor 
to transmitter on goosey little fork- 
lift front-end loaders that zoomed 
over and around the hills with an 
excited shriek or an ill-tempered 
snarl, depending on the driver’s 
mood. 

Someday someone would build a 
reverse station, when rimworld 
colonies were sufficiently establish- 
ed to ship Homeworldsway, and 
there’d be more of us here; but we 
made a pleasantly close and 
friendly group, and none of us felt 
the lack of company. Bopp, Garth, 
Becky, Carol, Mari, Doc, Stew, 
and myself — all of us experts at 
practically everything. We respect- 
ed and supported each other. Some 
of us were more expert than others, 
of course. I was particularly handy 
with an FEL; Bopp could think like 
the minicomp; Becky could sense 
receptor load without using meters, 
and Mari’s hand on the directional 
beam was more accurate than any- 
one else's. We’d shaken into a unit, 



103 




over the years. No one grudged me 
my afYection for Rags, a native 
whatnot (no one could really classi- 
fy it), or Becky’s mess of leather- 
work, or Doc’s persistent inquisi- 
tiveness, which added to our book- 
reels and required our patient an- 
swering of his impertinent ques- 
tions; Doc didn’t mean to pry, 
exactly, he simply had to know. 

Cargo came through regularly, 
kicked by a chain of nuclear fur- 
naces, our Ingeborgian sun being 
merely the nearest, in crates meas- 
uring and massing identically to 
spare the minicomp that adjust- 
ment. The only variable factor 
aside from the contents (which were 
none of our business, but we always 
checked invoices anyway) was their 
destination. We had to ‘ping’ each 
shipment, bouncing the beam un- 
loaded through n-space to the 
designated terminal, computing 
feedback, and vanishing the crates 
on toward colony worlds even fur- 
ther down the rim than we were. 

The shipment I was shuttling 
from receptor to transmitter that 
day was aimed for Salvation, a 
badly misnamed iceworld, but one 
judged suitable for colonization. I 
had the third totcrate balanced on 
the FEL when the siren howled and 
the warning light swirled. 

Scared? There are no words to 
tell how scared 1 was. I backed the 
FEL off, spun the clumsy thing like 
a dancing bear, and snapped 
through the multi-gears like grim 
Death was chasing me. 



Somehow' I had time to think 
quite calmly, maybe it’s just a short 
in the warning system, but I’d 
better leave fast, just in case. And 
of course, my cargo was precious; 
they crate children carefully. But if 
the receptor was about to blow . 

It blew. 

I flew off the seat, smashed 
against the upper edge of the crate, 
rose with the blast. Hunks of debris 
flew about me, traveling at about 
my speed; 1 javelined along face 
down in a more or less flat 
trajectory. I could see cowering 
bushes, dust whirling in the FEL 
tracks, fragmented blossoms I’d 
stopped to admire on my last 
trip . my last trip . 

1 could pick out individual glass 
blades. Either I was dropping or 
the ground was rising. I puzzled 
over the problem, and finally 
realized it was both. I’d reached the 
slope. The perception amused me. 
I was laughing when I hit. 

B opp was bending over me when 
I woke; the moon was down, 
but he’d set out glowlux. Ingeborg 
is way to hellangone down the arm, 
so the nightsky is mostly ink. 

Bopp didn’t seem to realize I was 
awake; I lay quietly for a while, 
thinking that's funny, 1 don't hurt, 
except my head aches. Then I 
thought. Oh god, I wish I did hurt. 

“I’m dead, man,” I said. I 
meant to whisper, but it roared out 
of me. 

Bopp jumped like a prodded 



104 



GALAXY 




cow. Then he steadied, and replied 
quite calmly. "Not quite. Bud.” 

“My neck's broken, isn’t it?” 

“Don’t think so. You’re still 
breathing.” 

He was right. A respirator was 
one of the luxuries our medikit 
didn’t have; either I was breathing, 
or I’d discovered a workable substi- 
tute. 

“Seem to be,” I agreed. I was 
sprawled on the hillside, cradled in 
that limitless meadow. Bopp hadn’t 
dared move me. 

“Is everyone else all right?” I 
asked finally. 

“Garth reached the shelter. 
Becky didn’t." The rest of the crew 
had been at the transmitter, and 
were bound to be safe. Unless what- 
ever blew uprooted that, too. But 
that was unlikely, 

“Just Becky?" I sounded quite 
calm; I was surprised at myself. 

“Well, Rags, to.” 

“Damn.” When I’d found him, 
he’d been quite small, and we 
didn’t have any idea how big he 
would get; he’d been shaggy, 
friendly, curious and, fortunately, 
herbivorous. At his death he’d 
topped 500 kilos, looking a lot like 
a flatfooted Terran muskox. We 
never had solved the question of 
whether Rags followed me because 
he’d imprinted on me, or because 
he just liked the attention. We 
hadn’t made any real study of Inge- 
borgian ecology; it didn’t seem im- 
portant, once we found the planet 
was unsuited for colonization. 



Ingeborg was hostile. The 
weather was perennially temperate, 
the radiation level low, the air just a 
smidge high in oxygen, the gravity 
a touch below one g, the fauna 
friendly and/or harmless . but 
we couldn’t eat anything. On Inge- 
borg, all the longchain molecules 
rotated the wrong way. This meant, 
of course, that we kept a lot of fbod 
stockpiled, in case of disaster. 

And brother, we’d just had a 
disaster. 

Normal wear-and-tear we could 
fix, or jury-rig some acceptable re- 
pair; but there was no way to re- 
place the entire receptor system. 
That meant we were out of contact, 
until an in corpora ship could get to 
us. Without the powergrid on the 
receptor, we couldn’t even ping an 
SOS to another world. But they’d 
surely have noticed anything mas- 
sive enough to blow our station. 

Food could be an important 
problem. Still, with Becky gone, 
and me ... I couldn’t envision the 
world without me, but I couldn’t 
convince myself I’d be around . 
at least there would be plenty of 
food for the survivors. 

I could placidly contemplate my 
own death. 

Bopp had certainly injected me 
with something from shelf six of the 
medikit, the one that took a second 
key to open. He’d stuck a needle in 
my arm, and even though I knew 
my head was disconnected, the 
drug had reached my brain. Circu- 
lation hadn’t yet heard that I was in 



THE EGGS OF EDEN

two pieces. If it hadn’t noticed. I’d 
better not think about it, or it 
might read my mind. 

I howled with laughter, screwing 
my eyes up and roaring breath- 
lessly. 

Slowly the.spasm passed and the 
few stars grew fuzzy. Another drug, 
of course. I’d scared hell out of 
Bopp. 

Then I had a busy little dream. I 
was back on Charm III, in Tot- 
guard Training School; I was prac- 
ticing guarding tots, but something 
was wrong, I couldn’t see my 
Trainer anywhere, thirty or forty 
six-year-olds bulged an undersized 
room jampacked with playgear, 
and more kids were coming out of 
the woodwork. Literally. I watched 
them wriggle from heatducts, while 
others went two-dimensional and 
slithered in between the door jamb 
and the door. They were three deep 
on the floor, falling off the swings, 
perched on the climbing bars, 
stacked like and with the blocks, 
and most particularly, festooned all 
over me. 

Everywhere I looked they were 
snatching toys and smacking each 
other. I was supposed to control 
them, nontraumatically. Why were 
they picking on me? 

“We love you. Sissy,” they shrill- 
ed, pulling my hair, throttling me. 

“Be funny. Sissy, be funny, be- 
funny, befunnybefunny,” they 
screamed, swinging on my skirt, 
twisting my ankles. 

“I love you. Sissy,” a girlchild 



cawed, sinking her teeth in my 
hand. 

“EEEyow!” I yelled, snapping 
my wrist. She sailed lowgrav into 
the opposite wall, then slowly, 
slowly slithered down. On the 
yellow paint a dark-smear of blood 
glared at me. 

They stopped fighting each 
other. They were all over me, 
hitting, clawing, biting, break- 
ing .. 

“Up or down?” someone asked. 

“What do you say?” That was 
Bopp. 

“She's pretty far down, now.” 

“Well . .” Bopp never made a 
decision if he didn’t have to. 

The tots were gone, but not far; I 
could hear screams and shrieks of 
laughter in the distance. 

Where was I? A strange woman’s 
voice, and children . not Inge- 
borg, for sure. But wherever I was, 
Bopp was there too. 

“Up, I think,” the woman de- 
clared. 

“Up,” I agreed. My mouth was 
dry and my tongue thick. I opened 
my eyes; three daylit Bopps finally 
settled down to one-and-a-half of 
him. His square face, lumped by 
years of offhand reaction to the 
world, was frowning, but he wasn’t 
looking at me. I switched my 
gaze — oh, how I concentrated to do 
that — and there, sure enough, was 
a stranger. 

“Who . you?” I croaked. I 
was still lying on Ingeborg grass. 
Where had she come from? 



106 



GALAXY 




“I’m Nadi Belayen, nurse-at- 
tendant-in-transit,” she smiled. 
“I've got you pretty well patched 
up, 1 think. You’re showing some 
motor response in your extremities, 
now. Do you want another dose 
of . .” 

“No,” I interrupted her. If what- 
ever she’d given me had started 
that nightmare, I didn’t want any 
more of it. But I still heard chil- 
dren’s voices. Surely I wasn’t hallu- 
cinating audially, if my visual input 
was tracking, was I? “Children?” I 
asked. 

“The damaged crate,” Bopp said 
shortly. He wasn’t keen on our little 
visitors, either. None of us was 
child-oriented; that was one of the 
reasons we worked a transit station 
instead of a Homeworld. 

Nadi began a long explanation; I 
cut my ears out of circuit and 
figured it out for myself. They’d 
unpacked her to care for me. She’d 
found the blasted crate and insisted 
on opening it, no matter what it did 
to our food-time ratio, or our 
sanity. 

“Just the one crate?” 

Bopp nodded, Nadi was still 
talking, but Bopp and I understood 
each other. From the twist of his 
heavy eyebrows, it was plain she’d 
wanted to uncrate all of them when 
she understood they were in- 
definitely delayed; transit takes a 
few hours, but we couldn't be res- 
cued for almost twenty years. Deep- 
frozen for transit, though, the 
crates would keep. 



I t had taken us six subjective 
weeks to reach Ingeborg, but 
better than twenty years had 
passed; only planet-based installa- 
tions could handle the power 
needed for n-space insertion. So 
whatever went wrong, wherever it 
had happened, unless by some odd 
chance an Installation ship was al- 
ready in our area, at a base nearly 
enough complete to receive mes- 
sages. that was not involved in 
whatever catastrophe destroyed us, 
that could be sent to pick us up . 
somewhere in that tangle of reason- 
ing, I’d convinced myself we were 
stuck here. 

Nadi had run down, or perhaps 
finished. 

“Any ideas?” I let my eyebrows 
wigwag back at Bopp. 

"Doc guesses an online sun’s 
gone nova." 

“The safeguards?" 

“Uh, uh. Those circuits look 
good on paper, but they've never 
been really tested. Anyhow, we got 
a critical overload, the receptor 
blew, the power’s gone. That’s it, 
Sue." 

Nadi was chattering again. 

“Mari and Carol are just sweet 
with the tots, but I’ve had to speak 
quite harshly to Stewart and Her- 
man about the serious effects of 
childhood trauma,” she chirped. 
She was a small, brownhaired, 
plump, smiling person, with a 
wrenlike way of tilting her head, 
and a sweet, high trill to her voice. 
"1 suppose it must be hard for you 



THE EGGS OF EDEN

to remember, all alone like this, 
how very sensitive small children 
are to emotional upset." 

I grunted. My arms and legs 
were numb, but my butt ached like 
fury where it pressed the ground, 
and 1 needed . a bedpan, badly. 1 
said as much. 

"Oh. my dear, 1 don’t dare lift 
you; just let it go. I’ll clean you 
up." 

"Noplas sheet,” 1 snapped at 
Bopp, and he trotted off. 

“It’s a good thing you had scan- 
panels and airsplints in your medi- 
kit, ” Nadi chattered. She seemed 
uneasy if she wasn't talking, a trait 
I had often noticed among guar- 
dians. 

"We have what we need for 
emergencies, until we can crate the 
victim for shipment,” I replied. 
That was why we didn’t have a 
respirator; anyone who needed it 
probably couldn’t survive shipment. 
But scanpanels, sheets about six 
millimeters thick that illuminated 
bony tissue to the naked eye, and 
airsplints to immobilize fractures, 
these were simple necessities on any 
world. She’d used her brain and 
our equipment, and hopefully done 
a workmanlike job on me; but my 
spine was definitely damaged. 
Well, now I knew where 1 stood. Or 
lay. 

The sun of Ingeborg blanketed 
me, and Nadi kept stroking my hair 
off my forehead; 1 suppose she 
thought it was soothing. Bopp 
galumphed up with a huge roll of 



noplas, and Nadi helped him fit a 
catchpan under me. 

Relieved, 1 remembered some- 
thing Nadi had said. 

“‘Herman?’” I asked Bopp. 

“Doc,” he grunted. 

Oh, oh. Then he'd be, omigod, 
Francis; I’d at least be Suzanne, 
not Sissy, that sillyass diminutive 
that was supposed to make tots like 
me. I preferred “Bud,” though I’d 
been tagged that for continually us- 
ing it instead of names; now it was 
familiar, friendly. And she’d had to 
speak firmly to Doc and Stew about 
traumatizing the brats. A warning 
bell went off in my head. 

“Kids sampling local flora?” I 
snapped. 

“You guessed it.” 

“You explain?” My eyes slapped 
Nadi-ways and back. 

“Tried to." 

Hoo, boy. We had a progressive 
nurse-attendant on our hands, a 
dozen unsocialized tots, and a hos- 
tile planet. 

“Look, Belayen,” I began. 

“Oh, Sue, please call me Nadi.” 
So she could be informal with an- 
other woman. 

“Whatever. Do you realize that 
anything those tots ingest is dan- 
gerous? Reactions range from 
acute allergy to actual death-by- 
poisoning. And we tested healthy 
adults, with carefully measured 
minidoses. Take the pseudopears, 
they look and taste delicious, but 
are deadly; fruit sugars are rapidly 
absorbed and rejected. Are you 



108 



GALAXY 




sure you’ve warned the children?” 
“They’re much too young to heed 
warnings, Suzanne. Mari and the 
others are guarding them.” 

“How old are they?” 

“The youngest is eight,” Bopp 
growled. “In my opinion, that’s a 
fair age to learn, madam. Any kid 
of eight who can’t understand a 
simple rule in Basic Standard, is 
too defective to survive on the rim.” 
“Oh, they’ll learn, Francis, 
they'll learn; but gradually, 
through experience and reasonable 
explanation, not by frightening lec- 
tures, and certainly not through 
punishment. It will take time, of 
course, and they must be carefully 
watched, but they will learn, and 
without damage to their personal 
integration. It would have been a 
good thing if you and your friends 
had had the benefit of a modern 
upbringing.” 

That was a low blow; all of us 
were twenty years outdated just by 
being here, but we’d all grown up 
in the usual Environment; none of 
us had experienced family-group 
trauma. Bopp reacted with char- 
acteristic tact. 

“Madam, if those children eat 
anything here, the result will be far 
more traumatic than any lecture 1 
can imagine. More traumatic even 
than corporal punishment. 
More . .” 

“Don't be silly, Francis,” she cut 
him off in midflight. “They’re care- 
fully watched. What can possibly 
happen?” 



“It’s been my experience,” I 
began, but she cut me off, too. 

“I’ll just go and check up on 
them, since you two are so anxious 
about them. I’m getting a new out- 
look on you primitive types — a very 
favorable one. I thought you took 
this sort of job because you were 
unable to adapt to a child-oriented 
environment." She trotted off, still 
flinging compliments over her 
shoulder. 

“I wonder what the survival 
factor really is on newsettled 
worlds?” I muttered. 

“Very, very low,” Doc replied, 
coming up behind us. “Damn 
shame, really. They’re bright little 
bastards, every one of them. We’ll 
have some bad cases of poisoning 
soon; the others’ll have to learn 
from that.” He dropped beside me, 
wagging his bald head sadly. 

“I doubt if they’ll be allowed to,” 
I said, thinking back over my train- 
ing. “I bet if one of them gets sick it 
will be hustled into isolation, and 
the others won’t be told why. Hard 
truth is too raw for tender minds.” 

“Tell me you're kidding,” Bopp 
pleaded. 

“Unless things have changed 
radically, I'm not.” 

“Where could they find an isola- 
tion unit here?” Doc asked practi- 
cally. 

“But those kids are bred for 
transit,” Bopp exclaimed at the 
same time. 

“Sure they are,” I answered 
Bopp. “But they’re born on Home- 



THE EGGS OF EDEN

worlds, raised in Environments, 
cared for by psychologically orient- 
ed Guardians, none of whom have 
ever been out. What they see 
doesn’t impress them, they're 
raised on holovee. They know 
about animals, but nothing with 
teeth has evef chased them. I mean 
the adults, Bopp, the ones who 
raise these children. They baby 
them to shipping age, pack them 
off — and never really connect their 
training with the horrifying mor- 
tality-rate; it isn’t real to them. 

“If Nadi had completed transit, 
she’d find herself with a couple of 
hundred children, on a raw world 
with very little help and a few basic 
supplies, on the far end of a pipe- 
line that is stingy at the best of 
times, except with more warm 
bodies. That is the only thing 
Homeworlds has a surplus of, the 
only thing they’ll ship out in quan- 
tity. The ones that lived would be 
the ones fit to manage the 
colony ... I suppose ...” I was 
getting tired. 

“They must lose all their sociali- 
zation under those circumstances,” 
Doc mused, chewing thoughtfully 
on a fingernail. 

"Seems pretty damn cruel to me, 
and wasteful, too,” Bopp answer- 
ed. “Better teach them something 
first, and give them a fighting 
chance.” 

“They'd get a better return on 
their investment, too.” 

“Not all tots ship out,” 1 
muttered. “They’d be teaching 



their own people survival tactics, 
too.” 

I’d never thought of that before; 
I’d simply had a gut reaction to the 
amorphous atmosphere of the En- 
vironment, created a trauma or 
two. and been rejected from 
Guardianship as incorrigible. I’d 
been upset at the time, of course, 
but no, I had to admit that working 
for Interworld, up to now, had been 
a hellovalot better. Trying to pre- 
vent infant trauma had traumatiz- 
ed me pretty thoroughly; working 
with a bunch of perfectly egocenter- 
ed adults had salvaged me. And 
now we were playing guardian 
again, dancing to Nadi’s tune like a 
bunch of blobheaded jellybags. 

N adi was a Guardian, but Inge- 
borg was our planet. We knew 
our way around, and she didn’t. 
We could put those kids on the 
right track ourselves; hopefully be- 
fore any of them died from her 
pussyfooting. Ingeborg was a para- 
dise — aside from the fact that 
nothing on it was edible; if we could 
just hammer home that simple 
lesson, and keep the kids from 
falling out of trees, or drowning, we 
had a good chance of raising them. 

Oh, no, we don’t, said I to 
myself. Better let them die now; we 
won’t have enough food. 

Twenty years’ rations for eight 
wouldn't begin to feed us, Nadi, 
and twelve growing children. But I 
couldn’t simply accept letting them 
die .

I must have slept the clock 
around; the morning sun was full in 
my face, and 1 squinted, trying to 
see who sat beside me. I risked 
turning my head, just a fraction, 
before pain warned me that was 
plenty, thank you! But my back 
ached even more than it had yester- 
day, and my legs tingled. I was de- 
lighted. Nothing could be as terrify- 
ing as that first dead numbness. 

“Carol?” 

She bent over me, straight brown 
hair curtaining her cheeks. 

"Hi, Bud. Hungry?” Oh, that 
beautiful, practical gal! 

Then she fetched Doc, and we 
worked out a system for out- 
maneuvering Nadi long enough to 
indoctrinate the children. 1 
dredged theory out of my aborted 
training; Garth, Mari, Carol, Stew, 
and Doc did all the work. Bopp ran 
herd on Nadi, and Nadi labored 
grimly to get me on my feet, pos- 
sibly thinking that once that was 
accomplished, she could regain full 
control of the tots. 

We lost tw'o of them, before they 
settled down and took us seriously. 
The rest of them saw exactly what 
happened, the retching, the convul- 
sions, the delirium ... it was a 
hundred times more effective than 
any lecture. 

Stew 7 caught another little what- 
not and, playing with it, the kids 
got their minds off the recent 
horror. They named their new pet 
Puddles, and pretty soon two of the 
older boys came home with another 

THE EGGS OF EDEN 



one. Doc suggested they call that 
one Piddle, but was fortunately 
outvoted. The girls tagged it Cocoa, 
because it was almost black, with a 
white tuft on the tail which, they 
explained, was the marshmallow in 
the cup ... by then, I was walk- 
ing. Very short distances, with lots 
of help, but walking. 

And we were already into our 
second years’ rations. 

R aising kids on Ingeborg was 
almost fun, once we under- 
stood what we were doing. Even 
Nadi had to admit, after a few 
furious months, that we hadn’t 
caused any paralyzing traumas. 
Kids went everywhere and did 
everything with adults; soon each 
adult found a favorite among the 
kids, and some were naturally left 
out. So w e had to agree among our- 
selves that we’d share out as evenly 
as possible, and the one thing we’d 
never do was pit “my” kid against 
"your" kid . tricky, in practice, 
no matter how easy it is to say. Be- 
fore long we found we needed very 
little discipline. The kids were busy 
and respected, with jobs to do and 
enough people to turn to that no 
one was neglected, and we didn't 
overpraise anyone, either. Doc said 
our community was modeled after 
certain ancient Terran Amerindian 
societies, but none of us had even 
heard of a Terran Amerind. We 
just did w'hat seemed right at the 
time. 

We learned a good deal about 

111 




Ingeborg; for one thing, we found 
that the whatnots were bisexual, re- 
produced marsupially, and that 
Cocoa was of one sex, the one with 
the pouch, and Puddles was of the 
other, and laid the babies Cocoa 
carried and fed. Pretty soon we had 
a herd of vyhatnots, following the 
kids around, lumberingly friendly. 

It was four years before de- 
terioration began in the two tot- 
crates stored in the deepcache with 
our rations. By then our tots ranged 
from twelve to fourteen, and we 
were faced with another worry. We 
adults had been made sterile before 
being shipped here in corpora, but 
Nadi and the kids had been crated 
for a rimworld that needed warm 
bodies; they’d been sent out to 
breed like rabbits. 

We had a choice: stretch a few 
lives for rescue (and to do that, the 
kids practically had to stop eating, 
forget about having babies) or un- 
crate the rest of the tots, and live a 
short life but a moral one. Delaying 
making that choice seemed 
immoral to me, but being human, 
that was what we did. 

We'd rationed ourselves, and as 
soon as the kids matured physi- 
cally, we expected the same of 
them; not starvation, but real aus- 
terity. And I guess we’d taken it for 
granted that more of us would die, 
in the course of things, and the 
food would stretch. 

I’m not sure how the others felt, 
but Doc and I watched those kids 
adolesce with quiet terror. We’d go 



off to the lake, and watch lungfish 
lurch out of the water after lowfly- 
ing insects, and swear bitterly at 
the fate that gave us such beauty 
and not a bite to eat. 

Doc let me know he felt anything 
we did about the kids was pretty 
much up to me. I felt I needed 
Nadi’s cooperation; after all, she 
was the nurse. 

I put it off as long as I could. 
Finally, the matter was taken out of 
my hands. I was supervising clean- 
up; the men were off somewhere 
with the FEL’s; the other girls were 
elsewhere. Nadi was sitting watch- 
ing me get the kids to help. We 
didn't have much to litter with, but 
you know kids — if there's anything 
at all, they’ll drop it and walk over 
it as if it wasn’t there. Rose and 
Pete, who were supposed to be 
helping, were talking with Nadi; I 
resented their laziness, but was too 
occupied to speak of it. My kids 
were working half-heartedly, and 
watching Nadi and her two covert- 
ly. Jody, the youngest boy, had 
pretty well attached himself to me, 
because 1 used an FEL whenever I 
went very far, and he was crazy 
about machinery. We’d stripped 
down and rebuilt the engine to- 
gether, when it began to vibrate; he 
was clever, and a quick learner, 
and 1 was glad to have him drive 
me. 

I could tell Jody resented Rose 
and Pete as much as I did. but I 
didn’t expect him to try to shame 
them into working.

“Rose loves Petey,” he sing- 
songed, pointing derisively. “Rose 
and Petey go off together, into the 
grass.” He jerked obscenely. Then 
he howled, as Jim backhanded him 
savagely on the mouth, and bored 
in, head down and fists swinging; 
Jody wasn’t one to take punishment 
lying down. 

“Shut up, you little freak,” Jim 
shouted, fending off Jody’s fists. 
“Just shut your freaking mouth!” 
“They do, they do, they do! 
You’re mad, cause you want Tami 
to go with you! I seen you, I did!" 

I was moving as quickly as I 
could, but Nadi got there first, try- 
ing psychology (now, then, dears, 
what’s this all about?) and then 
physically restraining Jody. I broke 
the group up with some hastily in- 
vented busywork, and they went; 
they knew I was mad. 

“All right, Nadi,” 1 said when 
the kids were gone, “what can we 
do about this?” 

“About what?” Oh, innocence! 
“You know we haven’t enough 
food even for ourselves. We simply 
can't let the kids breed.” 

“You talk as if they were 
animals!” 

“In this sense, they are.” 
“You’re jealous.” 

“Because I’m sterile?” The ab- 
surdity of it angered me even more. 
“At least I’m not hogging rations! 
You don’t know the meaning of 
austerity!” 

“That isn’t fair!” 

“I’ve seen you “tasting” the food 



you’re cooking. It makes a meal in 
itself, your samples!” 

"Don’t talk to me like that!” 
“You don’t deny it, do you?” I 
was screaming. 

“Why should I? I never take 
more than my fair share, what I’d 
have on any other world!” 

“You dumb broad, don’t you 
understand you’re making the rest 
of us starve?” 

“I knew you were jealous! Just 
because I’m fertile, and you’re not! 
You’re afraid the men will ignore 
you!” 

“They're sterile, too, and I 
haven’t been ignored, not so’s 
you’d notice! But that isn’t the 
point, Nadi.” I strove to speak 
more calmly. “Really and truly, we 
can’t spare the food. When the 
deepcache is empty, we’ll starve.” 
“It’s still almost full.” 

"It’s built to hold twenty years’ 
rations; we’ve used six, we’ve been 
pretty careful, and it still looks 
pretty full. But there’s no way we 
can possibly be rescued in less than 
eighteen years. Figure it out, Nadi; 
in four years, we’ve used six years’ 
rations. Even if we’re very, very 
careful, we’ll have trouble stretch- 
ing the food for eighteen years, and 
there’s no guarantee we’ll be picked 
up then, either. Even if we’re still 
alive.” 

“You’re trying to scare me. You 
just don’t like me.” She didn’t even 
sound excited any more. I hadn’t 
realized how impervious she was. 
“Nadi, we’ve got to keep the kids 



THE EGGS OF EDEN 



113 




from breeding. They know about 
the food, but unless we help them, 
they won’t be able to help them- 
selves. We don’t have any birth- 
control drugs, but you’re a nurse. 
You must have some ideas.” 

“They’re still children. Sue. It 
can’t be all that urgent.” 

“Have you looked? Those two 
you were talking to just now are 
big, strong, fully matured 
breeders.” 

“I told you that you were 
jealous.” 

What could you do with a woman 
like that? I swung around, and 
suddenly realized that Jody was 
standing beside me, silent, mouth 
open, face deadly pale. He’d never 
seen two women screaming at each 
other before; I suppose we’d 
managed to do what Nadi had 
always feared, and traumatized 
him, but I was too upset to care. 

“Are we really going to starve?” 
he whispered anxiously. 

“Not today, love,” I replied 
briskly, trying to get a smile. 

Nadi was still standing there, 
staring triumphantly at me. 

“Aren’t you supposed to be start- 
ing dinner?” I snapped. 

“Oh, of course. I wouldn't inter- 
fere for the world.” 

“What?” I yelled. Jody was 
twelve, not yet pubescent; she could 
actually sneer at me when she 
fawned over hulking fourteen-year- 
olds, and flirted with them, too. 
Nadi was just as likely to get preg- 
nant as any of them. 



I told Jody to go off and play; the 
men were back, I could hear the 
FEL’s. I knew he’d tell Doc what 
he’d heard, but 1 was too angry to 
think to caution him. I had to think 
of some way to convince Nadi to 
teach contraception to the fertile 
girls, but I couldn’t. The more I 
thought, the madder I got, and the 
madder I got — the nerve of that 
woman! — the less able I was to 
think. 

I don’t know how much later it 
was when I heard a terrible 
screech from the cookshack, and 
saw Jody tearing toward me. I can’t 
stand quite straight, but I can still 
hurry when I have to. 

It was Nadi, of coursa, vomiting, 
convulsing; she’d spilled the stew 
pot and the stove was in real danger 
of being upset. Rose was holding 
her head, or trying to; it was more 
than one girl could handle. Doc 
and Bopp carried her out where she 
couldn’t hurt herself, and I dug 
into the drugbox for the small vial 
of antiallergen that was all wc had 
left. 

It had to be deliberate. No one 
asked about it, not even Doc; no 
one wanted to know. 

By the time Nadi was up and 
around again, it was obvious that 
Rose and Tami were already preg- 
nant. Nothing in the medikit would 
act as a chemical abortifacient, and 
Nadi swore she hadn’t the training 
to interfere surgically. I’d thought 
it was fairly simple, but Nadi gave a 



114 



GALAXY 




lecture on the subject, and Doc 
backed her up. She did teach the 
other kids basic contraception. We 
watched the blossoming stomachs 
of the two gravid girls, and I got so 
I was counting rations in my sleep. 

It was hard to realize how 
desperate our straits were. Inge- 
borg is so beautiful that Paradise 
suffers by comparison: warm sun, 
gentle rain, even climate, sweet 
water. But Paradise had only one 
tree forbidden its residents. 

The heavier Rose and Tami 
grew, the more I felt I had to get 
away. The only way I could see for 
any of us to live was for some of us 
to die voluntarily, and I was a 
logical candidate. But someone 
would have to see that the kids 
didn’t get out of line, and someone 
would have to pull those crates out 
of the deepcache and dump them 
before Nadi noticed how they were 
discharging, and someone would 
have to prod the kids into keeping 
up their studies and their records — 
we insisted that each of them write 
a daily log — and the someone 
usually seemed to be me; but 1 was 
the one who should die, soon, be- 
fore I used up more rations. So 
Jody spent quite a lot of time 
driving me around and generally 
trying to cheer me up, with Hey 
You, his darkgold whatnot calf, 
flatfooting behind us. When the 
sun got high, Jody would park the 
FEL under a clump of pseudopears 
and help me down, and we’d sit 
and talk, or I’d sleep while Jody 



climbed for fruit to toss to Hey 
You. The whatnots were wild about 
those pears, which normally didn’t 
drop until they’d dried into a sort of 
inedible parachute that the wind 
carried several hundred meters, 
and where they landed, there’d 
soon be the beginnings of another 
clump of trees. They only produced 
fruit for a few years, though, so 
they had to seed liberally. 

I had the kids keeping notes on 
everything we found on Ingeborg, 
anything we thought of, or guessed 
at; partly for practice, and partly in 
the desperate hope we'd think of 
something miraculously lifesaving. 

Anyway, this day we went a lot 
further than usual, over the crest of 
hills beyond the station and across 
the broad valley beyond. Then Hey 
You started to tire, and Jody 
steered for a clump of trees about 
halfway up the slope. Before we got 
there, though. Hey You started to 
act oddly, sniffing the ground, and 
shying away, and hopping up and 
down, and generally acting the 
fool. So Jody naturally stopped the 
FEL and we got down to see what 
her problem was. 

There on the ground was a clump 
of small, deep blue ovoids. I picked 
one up; it was cool, jellied, but 
firmly shaped. They lay there like a 
nest of shell-less eggs without the 
nest. Hey You pranced about near- 
by; idly I tossed one to her. She was 
used to catching pears, and fielded 
it neatly. Jelly globs dripped off her 
flews. Then she went absolutely 



THE EGGS OF EDEN 



115 




wild, spitting, shaking her head, 
thrusting her paws into her 
mouth . Jody grabbed her and 
dragged her down to a stream at 
the foot of the slope, and she thrust 
her head into the water and shook 
it, and blew, and choked, and 
finally drank and drank and drank. 

In the meantime, I was thinking. 
What Hey You could eat, we 
couldn’t. This she instinctively 
knew she shouldn’t eat; maybe we 
could. It was a wild chance, but 
hadn’t I already figured I’d be the 
one to die? 

I nibbled an egg, nervously, half 
expecting it to burn my tongue, so 
I’d spit and paw my mouth like the 
poor whatnot. But it was bland, 
slightly salty, sort of a cross be- 
tween raw egg and lightly flavored 
gelatin. I licked my fingers, packed 
the rest into the carryall of the 
FEL, and drove down the hill to 
where Jody knelt beside Hey You. 
The calf was down, breathing 
harshly and trembling. I helped 
Jody tie it to the loader. 

All the way back, I kept watch- 
ing myself for some reaction, 
shuddering sympathetically with 
the suffering whatnot, but it was all 
sympathy. I felt fine. 

Nadi eagerly helped with the 
nearly comatose calf. I took Doc 
aside and showed him the eggs. 

“How long ago did you eat it?” 
he asked, turning up my eyelids 
and taking my pulse. 

“Must have bpen two hours,” I 
said around the thermometer. 



“The whatnot reacted instantly, 
though.” 

“Any more of them out there?” 

I shrugged; where there were 
eggs there were egg-layers — and 
thus more eggs. Obviously. He re- 
moved the thermometer. 

“Temperature’s normal. No 
cramps, no vomiting, no hives or 
asthma ... so far.” 

“I didn’t look for any more. I 
went to help Jody with the calf.” 
Doc glanced at the sky. “Too late 
to go back today, I’m afraid. Let’s 
hope you tolerate this, and there’s 
lots more, and they don’t 
spoil . .’’he breathed the list like 
a prayer. 

We boiled the eggs and I ate 
them. Doc wanted to share them 
with me, but I told him that was 
stupid and he admitted as much. I 
slept badly, still expecting symp- 
toms; Doc sat quietly beside me. 
Either he was a lot more confident 
in my fate than I, or he was a better 
actor. 

Hey You died in the night. We 
carried her back to the valley of the 
blue eggs and buried her there, 
which seemed to comfort Jody 
somewhat. Then we hunted the 
whole hillside for more eggs, and 
found nothing. Hot and tired, we 
gathered by the pseudopear tree be- 
side Hey You’s grave. 

“We’ll have to search with what- 
nots,” I said. “It was Hey You that 
found those others.” 

Naturally the kids raised a storm 
of protest; they were as attached to 



116 



GALAXY 




their pets as Jody, We held an im- 
promptu town meeting on the 
sunny hillside, shouting at each 
other and generally growing inco- 
herent and red in the face. 

“We won’t make that mistake 
again,” I yelled, silencing them by 
sheer volume. “It was my fault that 
Hey You ate that egg. We spotted 
them by her avoidance reaction; 
she knew better than to eat them. If 
1 hadn’t tossed it like a pear, she’d 
be fine now — but we might not 
know we could eat those things.” 

Doc took a turn emphasizing the 
importance of a new food supply to 
help us hold till rescue; they knew 
it, but they needed reminding. 

“So what’s the maximum time to 
rescue, Herman?” Nadi asked 
innocently. 

“Forever, Madam.” Doc’s voice 
was frosty. 

She thought he was kidding. 

W e were too excited to wait 
for the girls to deliver before 
mounting a full scale expedition. 
Carol and Mari packed food, Stew 
rounded up the whatnots with the 
kids, I revved up an FEL while 
Garth, Doc, and Bopp consulted 
on a course from the old aerial 
maps. Nadi and Mari would stay 
with Rose and Tami. Everyone else 
would spread the whatnots into a 
loose sweeping crescent, while I 
rode drag on the FEL to watch for 
strays, and run errands. Like, 
hopefully, carrying back clutches of 
eggs- 



This was new territory for us; 
there’d never seemed much point in 
exploration, knowing that there 
was nothing out there to eat. Sur- 
veys showed that the miles and 
miles of lake-dotted prairie simply 
went on for miles and miles. We 
planned to sweep out straight past 
the valley as far as we felt safe 
supply-wise, then return on a 
passing sweep. If necessary. 

•It wasn’t. Large clumps of the 
clear, shell-less eggs showed up just 
over the hill from Hey You’s valley; 
we ate them for the evening meal. 
The next morning we found enough 
“nests” to make it worthwhile for 
me to run them back to base for 
processing. The whatnots were per- 
fect pointers; they bucked and 
whined and carried on to our com- 
plete satisfaction. They also misbe- 
haved around various bare patches 
of earth, where the prairie grass 
had rotted to the ground; Doc 
guessed that decaying egg-masses 
had poisoned the soil. 

However, we never saw anything 
that could have laid the eggs, not 
one sign of any strange animal. 
And it had to be strange, whatever 
dropped anything we could eat. 
Naturally we wanted to identify it. 
If it was alien to the planet, it had 
to have a food supply somewhere 
that we could eat. If it/they could 
eat the rotated proteins and some- 
how untwisted them in their bodies, 
we might be able to eat them. 

I had nearly twenty kilos of eggs 
to take back to camp. And I met 



THE EGGS OF EDEN 



117 




Mari, hiking out to meet me, 
following the flattened grass. 

1 didn’t need to ask. 

“Nadi decrated the rest of the 
kids. Right?” 

Mari nodded, breathlessly, then 
burst into tears. 

1 got her calmed down, and she 
explained. 

“She must have seen the crates 
when she went to the cache right 
after you left. 1 didn't even know 
she was going, we didn’t need any 
more food out, we had plenty, but 
you know what a glutton she is. 

“At least that’s what 1 think she 
did. Because she must have 
drugged us. She doesn’t trust us, 
especially since that stew . any- 
how, we all woke with a sick head- 
ache about noon — with tots 
popping all over the place." 

“Damn," 1 groaned. “If she’d 
just waited til we were sure of those 
eggs, we’d have uncrated the chil- 
dren properly! Any adults in those 
crates?” 

“No. Oh, Bud, I’d forgotten 
what hellions our kids were! We 
tried to round them up and lecture 
them, but Nadi interfered. She’s 
going to raise this group her way. 
You wouldn’t believe the time we 
had! And now four or five of the 
kids are poisoned, and Nadi was 
trying to get the rest away instead 
of nursing the sick ones, but any- 
how we haven’t any more antialler- 
gen, and Tami went into labor, and 
I tried to get Nadi to help her, but 
Nadi was hysterical, she wasn’t 



even making sense. So Rose and I 
hammered some rules into the kids; 
they were pretty scared by that 
time, and I came to get help.” 

“Out to fetch the cavalry?” I 
tried to keep my voice light. The 
one time Mari should have stuck it 
out . but I should talk; I’d left 
Nadi where she could get at those 
crates. 

“I had to! Nadi’s gone sort of 
catatonic, the kids are scared out of 
their minds, the sick ones must be 
dying, Tami’s in labor, and poor 
Rose can’t cope.” She wrapped 
herself around me and sobbed 
miserably. I disentangled myself, 
cursing our stupidity in not provid- 
ing radio-transmitters for our ex- 
pedition. We hadn’t built any 
before; we rarely were out of ear- 
shot. But we should have planned 
better, not rushed off in all direc- 
tions at the first hope of survival. 

We could cobble up transceivers 
from transmitter parts easily 
enough; we’d left the remaining 
station alone, as if it could magi- 
cally link us to the universe. Now 
was the time to rip into it for every 
bit of technology we could salvage. 

We were going to survive! Our 
lives had meaning again! Before 
anyone could rescue us, there’d be 
a third generation on Ingeborg; 
we’d make sure our rescuers found 
people, not savages. We’d find 
metal ore, we’d reinvent tools that 
didn’t require intricate fabrication. 
Our little colony had a real chance 
for life.

I raced the FEL back, in time to 
see Tami’s baby boy born. 



W ell, now we know that what- 
ever disrupted our station 
was probably more than an online 
nova; it’s more than ten years past 
the date we figured for rescue. We 
don’t talk about that any more. 

Bopp's dead, and Garth, and 
Stew; I’m pretty crippled, but I get 
a lot of help. Statistically, women 
live longer than men. Statistics hurt 
in a small group like ours. 

We’ve done a lot, though. We 
had a small sack of seeds in store, 
from the colonization check; 
prayerfully we “killed” a patch of 
ground with rotted eggs, and sowed 
that withered seed. Some of it grew, 
and we hoarded its seed, and the 
next harvest was better; the grow- 
ing season is pretty much continu- 
ous, though we have to reconstitute 
the soil almost constantly. With the 
grain and vegetables we can grow, 
the eggs provide us with a pretty 
balanced diet. 

While we’re picking up all the 
blue eggs we can find, we find more 
and more of them. Apparently 
we’re encouraging production. 

We work; oh, my god, how we 
work! There’s so little time left for 
us. We should have realized much 
sooner that we were on our own, 
and faced our real problem: creat- 
ing a viable society for our suc- 
cessors. (Not our children. How I 
regret my casual accession to per- 



manent sterilization. Sometimes 
I’d almost rather leave damaged 
descendents than none at all . 
but our kids understand, and try to 
help; we’re all multiple god- 
parents.) 

Pseudopearleaves soaked in mild 
caustic, beaten, pressed, and rolled 
dry make fair paper; we don’t en- 
courage authorship, we require it. 
This is one society that will have 
complete historical records, and 
plenty of them. Everyone contri- 
butes to the evening thinktalks, 
and even the wildest suggestions 
are considered. Something one of 
the youngsters said gave Doc and 
Jody the idea for our improved 
gangplow; the permanent ink Pete 
makes came from a chance remark 
of mine about using fish secretions 
as fixative. Ingeborgian fish don’t 
cooperate, but there’s a kind of 
large beetle that does. 

The kids are fantastic, but we’re 
the ones who remember. They

the only ones who really believe in

“civilized world.” But they won’t 
be savages. They have their 
records, and their gumption, and 
everything we can fabricate before 
we’ve all left them. We even teach 
them n-space maths, impractical as 
they seem to kids who will spend 
their lives herding whatnots, farm- 
ing, and collecting blue eggs; Doc

claims they’re a religion, now. I say 
they’re true, and someday they’ll be 
useful to them. 

Nadi has authored an Epic: 
drama, dance, music, and history 
all stylized and interwoven. She 
takes each group of adolescents 
into her exclusive care for a year, 
and they learn to perform it for the 
anniversary of the Blast; it’s sort of 
a “coming of age” rite for them. 1 
suppose it’s her substitute for the 
Environment she’d like to isolate 
every tot in. It keeps a sense of his- 
tory alive, and it’s not bad ritual, 
though the language is elaborate, 
and everyone is shown as tremen- 
dously wise and capable. She’s left 
out all of our shocked scrambling 
and frantic making-do. In the 
Epic, when we find the eggs, we’ve 
almost starved to death, though it’s 
quite soon after the Blast, and 
everyone gathers to sing formal 
praise to the Power that spread 
manna in the desert, with phrases 
copped whole from her Bible. She’s 
put in a lot about me, making my 
recovery sound practically miracu- 
lous; this boosts her part, of course, 
and also lends authority to my find- 
ing the blue eggs. I get very em- 
barrassed, listening to an awestruck 
child pretending to be me; I feel as 
if I were being deified. 

Nadi’s moved herself and her 
school out to the remains of the 
transmitter. We were glad enough 
to see her go; she’s gone rather dra- 
matic and strange, but it doesn't 
seem to hurt the kids to let her 



teach them for just one year. She 
guards the cache, and what’s left of 
the equipment fanatically, though 
no one would think of touching 
them. There's just a few rations 
left, which we save for the annual 
Blastday Feast, and of course we’ve 
used everything we could from the 
transmitter, but Nadi’s laid out 
everything that’s left in solemn 
rows, carefully labeled; their ar- 
rangement bears no relation to 
their function, but she takes the 
kids on tour, and they recite the 
names Garth and Doc wrote on her 
labels like a hive of reverent bees. 
Even Becky’s tooled leather belt 
with the gold buckle is there; she 
should have been buried in it, but 
we didn’t find it until later, and no 
one wanted to wear it. Sometimes I 
wonder if the kids think it was part 
of the works? Nothing on the label 
says it wasn’t, and it must make as 
much sense to them as the crysta- 
circuits and transplates. 

Nadi sought me out recently, and 
breathlessly whispered that she’d 
heard a space ship land, way back 
before we found the first blue eggs. 
Naturally, I asked her why she 
waited so long to tell us, and I guess 
I hurt her feelings, being so skep- 
tical; she plans to write it into the 
Epic. Doc says it’s to compensate 
for not being rescued. We can’t be- 
lieve her; none of us heard any- 
thing, but if it helps her to think 
that way, there doesn’t seem to be 
much harm in it. 

Anyway, she attributes the egg- 



120 



GALAXY 




layers to divine providence, so an 
actual spaceboat is supererogatory. 
The fact that we’ve never been able 
to catch one of them, or even get a 
decent picture before we ran out of 
landfilm, has reinforced her cer- 
tainty in their supernatural origin. 
And it is true that the nights we 
watched from concealed blinds, 
they went elsewhere; we even had to 
search out their eggs again with 
whatnots. After that we put out a 
tripwired camera; it caught a blur, 
and they got scary again, and it 
took weeks before things settled 
down. I think they're psi-sensitive, 
or empathic, or both. They aren’t 
big, that much we know, and they 
move very fast. 

And it's plain they never evolved 
on Ingeborg. Somewhere there may 
be worlds with evenly mixed rota- 
tions; as Doc says, just because we 
haven’t found one doesn’t mean 
they don’t exist. The point is, the 
egglayers shouldn't exist here. 

1 tend to believe they’re escapees 
from some alien expedition, maybe 
strayed pets, and they couldn’t 
multiply until we came along to 
clean up after them, so they didn’t 
poison their pasture. Before, they’d 
have to keep on the move, and that 
couldn’t be a good way to raise 
their young. On the other hand, if 
they’re intelligent, 1 suppose they 
could eventually try to control us. 
Keep us as their useful pets. 

So I’m just as glad we can’t see 
them. We imagine them as fantas- 
tic, benevolent, beautiful creatures, 



aware of our omnivorous appetites. 
Nadi’s working on that, though; 
she has a couple of her little grand- 
daughters in training now, learning 
to think loving thoughts at the crea- 
tures. Some day they’ll go out, pure 
dedicated virgins, to entice our shy 
egglaying unicorns. (Nadi’s educa- 
tion didn’t include the classical 
myths, but 1 wonder: what 

happened to captured unicorns?) 

Maybe Nadi is creating a re- 
ligion, as Doc says, while the rest of 
us build a society to fit. That’s 
scary; religions don’t deahwith the 
world as it is, they always set out to 
change it. While Nadi worships 
whatever provided the egglayers, 
and the Hand of God is as good a 
name as any, I guess it’s safe; if she 
ever centers her devotion on the 
egglayers themselves . that 
really bothers me. That’s when I 
wish I’d gone ahead and finished 
the job the poisoned stew began, so 
long ago. 

But the rest of us have our illu- 
sions, too; we still call them egg- 
layers. We've always known those 
blue spheres weren’t eggs; even 
extraterrestrial eggs would have in- 
ternal coherence, and no creature 
as biologically advanced as these 
would leave its next generation to 
rot. 

Ever hear of Coprid beetles? We 
know what we're eating, but it 
doesn’t sicken us, as long as we 
think of it as eggs. 

We’ve built a life here, collecting 
eggs in Eden. *

an Ellison bonanza for those ad- 
dieted to him and for those 
who want more material to go on 
hating him a lot. One is a reissue 
(Ellison Wonderland , Signet, 

SI. 25) of his first, 1962 collection. 
In a way it has always been my 
favorite Ellison book, one against 
which one may measure the aston- 
ishing distance he has traveled 
since he wrote stories like The 
Silver Corridor and Do-it-Y ourself. 
Intrinsically a good entertaining 
book, it is, especially with the new 
1974 introduction, an important 
strophe in the Ellison saga. The 
other book is Approaching Ob- 
livion (Walker, $7.95), which the 
author certainly is not. The man 
could die dead and not do that. The 
book contains all recent stories and 
one new one, and is as angry and as 
abrasive as anything he has done to 
date. A certain degree of disillusion 
has come to Ellison in recent years, 



and small wonder. Now he is angry 
because no one (he thinks) has been 
listening, no one (he thinks) has 
been moved by his energy, his 
passion, his compassion and his 
fury. Now he’s mad at you. I think 
more people have listened, have 
been moved by him than he 
realizes. I have become aware re- 
cently that among the great 
numbers of ex-flower-children from 
the late 'sixties who have cut their 
hair and reverted to tobacco have 
not, after all, changed anything but 
their exteriors. So it is with the ones 
who marched, the ones who pro- 
tested, the ones who hoped and 
acted, dreamed and acted. They’re 
under cover rather than under- 
ground now, but the change in 
them in basic no matter what 
appearances tell the pundits. 
Trivial and deep, certain changes 
take place within and around us,

Daily cannot eliminate the bikini 
and the miniskirt. President Ford 
cannot disappear Watergate, Rome 
cannot cancel contraception. Elli- 
son is supremely right in crying out 
in outrage against what he calls in 
his introduction students’ sinking 
“back into a charming Fifties 
apathy (with a simultaneous 
totemization of the banalities and 
mannerisms of those McCarthy 
Witch-Hunt Fifties) . but he 
seems not to be aware of the true 
meaning, for example of the ex- 
plosion of fury against Nixon when 
he fired Archibald Cox and insti- 
gated the “Saturday Night Mas- 
sacre.” 1 beg Harlan Ellison in this 
open forum not to despair, not to 
abandon either his passion nor the 
compassion which is his true well- 
spring, a deeper one than that 
puddle of anger and retribution in 
which he still insists on splashing 
and stomping. People have listened 
and will listen; people can change 
and will. 

The book carries a gracious 
Foreword by Michael Chricton, 
and the stories are a maelstrom and 
a chiaroscuro. Get it. 

Dig this: 

Now we can predict this 
apocalyptic date to within a 
couple of years. A remarkable 
chain of evidence, much of it 
known for decades but never be- 
fore linked together, points to 
1982 as the year in which the Los 
Angeles region of the San 



Andreas fault will be subjected to 
the most massive earthquake 
known in the populated regions 
of the Earth in this century. At 
the endpoint of the chain, direct- 
ly causing this disaster, is a rare 
alignment of the planets in the 
Solar System. By disturbing the 
equilibrium of the Sun, 
which in turn disturbs the whole 
Earth, the planets can trigger 
earthquakes. The trail links 
astrology — for that is really what 
the study of planetary alignments 
is, even though we can explain 
their effects in sound scientific 
terms — astronomy, meteorology, 
geology, geophysics and other 
sciences. Small wonder that 
pieces of this chain have lain 
about unrecognized for so long. 
But now they have been put to- 
gether there is no question about 
the implication: in 1982, when 
the Moon is in the Seventh 
House, and Jupiter aligns with 
Mars and with the other seven 
planets of the Solar System, Los 
Angeles will be destroyed. The 
astrological link with the 
dawning of the age of Aquarius 
may or may not be coincidence; 
that is outside the scope of this 
book, which contains only solid 
scientific evidence and reasoning. 

Never in my book-reviewing life 
before have I given away the punch- 
line, exposed the plot, until I wrote 
the above, which is p. 116 of The 
Jupiter Effect (Walker, introduc- 



es 




tion by Isaac Asimov, with two 
appendices and an index, $7.95.) 
Startling as it is, this conclusion is 
not the most interesting aspect of 
the book. Its authors, John 
Gribbin, an editor of the 
international science magazine 
Nature, and Stephen Plagemann, a 
meteorologist (among other things) 
with NASA, are not by any means 
kooks with a nutty theory. As Asi- 
mov points out in his introduction, 
they have gathered widely disparate 
clues and pieced them together 
with a meticulousness which rivals 
the performance of the greatest 
fictional detectives. And like 
detectives who know that a trial 
must follow their revelation, they 
lay out every scrap of evidence and 
every link of their chain of 
reasoning for examination and test. 
A more exciting, a more pertinent 
narrative would be hard to find. 
One thing particularly appealed to 
me: so many science and popular- 
science articles and books pursue a 
notion isolated, insulated from 
human affairs and human nature. 
What this book points out, 
explicitly and implicitly, about the 
bull-headedness and greed, the 
purposeful marriage to ignorance, 
of growth-oriented politicians and 
developers in earthquake-prone 
California, is almost as devastating 
as the quake itself. As in all good 
literature, the message, the moral, 
is larger than the narrative. This is 
going to be a most prestigious and 
effective book, especially out here 



in Never-never Land. Not effective 
enough, of course, but then . 
human beings will make their 
point, even more effectively than 
Gribbin and Plagemann. 



and speaking of the Good Doctor, 

he has (of course) another new 
book, and it was reviewed for us by 
the printer. As you may know, I get 
a good many forthcoming books in 
the form of galleys — long printed 
sheets, by which the printer sets up 
his type preparatory to breaking it 
down into pages. Each galley has 
the name of the book at the top, to- 
gether with various codings, and 
the number of the galley. At the top 
of Galley 5 in this one, where the 
title is supposed to go, the printer 
wrote: 

The Best Is Isaac Asimov 
The Best of Isaac Asimov 
(Doubleday, $6.95) really needs no 
other remarks than that; neverthe- 
less, I shall make some. The book 
is a collection of a dozen stories, 
chosen by the author as his own 
personal favorites. Some, like 
Nightfall, are acknowledged clas- 
sics; some, like Marooned Off 
Vesta, you may never have heard 
of, and are here because of Asi- 
mov's nostalgia for the peripheral 
circumstance of their origins. All of 
this he covers in a typical, charm- 
ing, highly personal asimovian 
introduction. It all helps to know 
the man better and, being what he 
is (to know him is to love him), 



124 



GALAXY 




knowing him better is to love him 
more. 

I do not know when Mr. van 
Daniken trotted out his first 
chariot, but it says here that 
Jacques Bergier wrote his Les 
Extra-Terrestres dans L'histoire for 
publication in 1970. The Regnery 
hardcover is dated 1973, and now 
we have it in paperback, as Extra- 
terrestrial Visitations from Prehis- 
toric Times to the Present (Signet, 
indexed, $1.50). It is so much 
better written, better reasoned, and 
generally, well, better than the 
original chariot and all its cabooses 
(now, there’s an image for you) that 
one can only be horrified at the 
popularity of the Swiss sensationa- 
list and his many imitators, just as 
one can be appalled at the fact that 
the publisher binds it to look like 
the others. It’s like putting a dia- 
mond seventh in line behind 
zircons. Bergier’s premise is that 
we have been visited by other 
beings whose function was (is?) to 
bring us knowledge, and also to 
create surprises in order to study 
our reactions and thus gauge our 
progress. In the course of this en- 
deavor, he gives us some of the 
most fascinating glimpses not only 
of a good many of the things van D 
writes about, but of strange and 
wonderful men in history, like Lord 
Cavendish and Benjamin Franklin, 
to name only a couple, and the vor- 
tices of knowledge which spun off 
from them and into their cultures. 



The big difference between Bergier 
and the others — even the others 
who obsessively debink each 
other — is that they all insist, while 
Bergier merely lays it out, lucidly 
and in an orderly fashion. If you 
are moved by van Daniken at all, it 
is likely that it will be in the direc- 
tion of faith-full acceptance. 
Bergier gives you solid leads for 
your own research. If you want your 
sense of wonder reborn, get this 
book. 

M ad Michael Moorcock is at it 
again, this time with the fur- 
ther adventures of Jherek Carne- 
lian, a resident of the wild, weird 
hedonistic culture “at the end of 
time.” An Alien Heat was the first 
volume of a trilogy, and this, The 
Hollow Lands, (Harper & Row, 
$6.95) is the second. In the first 
book we met Mrs. Amelia Under- 
wood, snatched mysteriously into 
the far future from 18% London, 
where the incomparable Jherek, the 
most naive innocent since Billy 
Budd, yet still to be compared with 
no one else you have ever encoun- 
tered, falls wildly and obsessively in 
love with her, follows her back to 
her own time, then returns alone to 
his own by means I shall not tell 
you. In this book, driven by his 
passion, he returns to her again, 
and they have — adventures. So 
much for the plot skeleton. Only 
Moorcock can convey the out- 
rageous texture of these narratives, 
the bored and potent subsidiary

characters, and the fabulous — that 
is, the real human truths for which 
all this madness is metaphor — 
quality of the tale-telling and the 
prose. Aside from R. A. Lafferty, I 
doubt there is a more accomplished 
prose stylist than Michael Moor- 
cock alive. (\Vell, maybe Nabakov.) 

I must say again, as 1 did in report- 
ing on the first book, that I’d gladly 
have waited a bit for this one and 
the next, to get them all in one 
volume. At these prices, and 180- 
some pages for each. The Dancers 
at the End of Time trilogy will come 
high. But then — you’ll have a high 
time with it. Con your library into 
getting it all, in any case. 

I think it’s time, and just, and 
kind of nice to salute our 
friendly rival with a mention of its 
25th birthday and The Best from 
Fantasy and Science Fiction 
(Doubleday, $7.95), one hell of a 
good book, edited by Edward L. 
Ferman. Now, I feel a little funny 
about this, because one of my 
stories is in it and, as I have said 
before, 1 tend not to review books 
with my stories in them. In this 
case, however, 1 feel I must. What 
Mr. Ferman has done is to gather 
together the lead stories of six of 
F&SF’s special issues, each of 
which featured an appreciation of 
the author by someone who knew 
him when, and a bibliography. The 
appreciations are by Judith Merrill, 
(two of them), William F. Nolan, 
L. Sprague de Camp, Gordon R.

Bradbury, Isaac Asimov, Fritz 
Leiber, Poul Anderson and James

one of these stories is not only good; 
it is, in my mind, important.

much more to tell you about. With 
the wish that I could expand my 
comments, let me recommend Sun-

collection by Robert Silverberg; 
Andiomeda Gun, (Berkley/Put-

THE MAN WHO CAME BACK 

He returned from the fathomless depths 
of space to reclaim his lost love— and 
they lived happily ever after . 



ROBERT SILVERBERG 



N aturally, there was a tre- 
mendous fuss made over him, 
since he was the first man actually 
to buy up his indenture and return 
from a colony- world. He had been 
away eighteen years, farming on 
bleak Novotny IX, and who knew 
how many of those years he had 
been slaving and saving to win his 
passage home? 

Besides, rumor had it that a girl 
was involved. It could be the big 
romance of the century, maybe. 
Even before the ship carrying him 
had docked at Long Island Space- 
port, John Burkhardt was a system- 
famed celebrity. Word of his return 
had preceded him — word, and all 
manner of rumor, legend and 
myth. 

The starship Lincoln, returning 
from a colony-seeding trip in the 
outer reaches of the galaxy, for the 
first time in its history, was carry- 
ing an Earthward-bound passenger. 
A small army of newsmen im- 
patiently awaited the ship’s land- 
ing, and the nine worlds waited 
with them. 

When he stepped into the un- 
loading elevator and made his 
descent, a hum of comment rippled 
through the gathered crowd. Burk- 
hardt looked his part perfectly. He 



was a tall man, spare and lean. His 
face was solemn, his lips thin and 
pale, his hair going gray though he 
was only in his forties. And his 
eyes — deepset, glowering, com- 
manding. Everything fit the myth: 
the physique, the face, the eyes. 
They were those of a man who 
could renounce Earth for unre- 
quited love, then toil eighteen years 
out of the sheer strength of that 
love. 

Cameras ground. Bulbs flashed. 
Five hundred reporters felt their 
tongues going dry with anticipation 
of the big story. 

Burkhardt smiled coldly and 
waved at the horde of newsmen. He 
did not blink, shield his eyes, or 
turn away. He seemed almost un- 
naturally in control of himself. 
They had expected him to weep, 
maybe kneel and kiss the soil of 
Mother Earth. He did none of those 
things. He merely smiled and 
waved. 

The Global Wire man stepped 
forward. He had won the lottery. It 
was his privilege to conduct the first 
interview. 

“Welcome to Earth, Mr. Burk- 
hardt. How does it feel to be 
back?” 

“I’m glad to be here.” Burk- 



128 




hardt’s voice was slow, deep, 
measured, controlled like every 
other aspect of him. 

‘‘This army of pressmen doesn’t 
upset you, does it?” 

“I haven't seen this many people 
all at once in eighteen years. But 
no — they don’t upset me.” 

“You know, Mr. Burkhardt, 
you’ve done something special. 
You’re the only man ever to return 
to Earth after signing out on an in- 
denture.” 

“Am I the only one?” Burkhardt 
responded easily. “1 wasn’t aware 
of that.” 

"You are indeed, sir. And I’d 
like to know, if I may — for the 
benefit of billions of viewers — if you 
care to tell us a little of the story 
behind your story? Why did you 
leave Earth in the first place, Mr. 
Burkhardt? And why did you de- 
cide to return?” 

Burkhardt smiled gravely. 
“There was a woman,” he said. “A 
lovely woman, a famous woman 
now. We loved each other, once, 
and when she stopped loving me I 
left Earth. I have reason to believe I 
can regain her love now, so I have 
returned. And now, if you’ll pardon 
me — ” 

“Couldn’t you give us any 
details?” 

“I’ve had a long trip, and I pre- 
fer to rest now. I’ll be glad to 
answer your questions at a formal 
press conference tomorrow after- 
noon.” 

And he cut through the crowd 



toward a waiting cab supplied by 
the Colonization Bureau. 

N early everyone in the system 
had seen the brief interview or 
had heard reports of it. It had cer- 
tainly been a masterly job. If people 
had been curious about Burkhardt 
before, they were obsessed with him 
now. To give up Earth out of un- 
requited love, to labor eighteen 
years for a second chance — why, he 
was like some figure out of Dumas, 
brought to life in the middle of the 
24th Century. 

It was no mean feat to buy one’s 
self back out of a colonization in- 
denture, either. The Colonization 
Bureau of the Solar Federation 
undertook to transport potential 
colonists to distant worlds and set 
them up as homesteaders. In return 
for one-way transportation, tools 
and land, the colonists merely had 
to promise to remain settled, to 
marry, and to raise the maximum 
practical number of children. This 
program, a hundred years old now, 
had resulted in the seeding of 
Terran colonies over a galactic 
radius of better than five hundred 
light-years. 

It was theoretically possible for a 
colonist to return to Earth, of 
course. But few of them seemed to 
want to, and none before Burk- 
hardt ever had. To return, you had 
first to pay off your debt to the 
government — figured theoretically 
at $20,000 for round-trip passage, 
$5000 for land, $5000 for tools — 



129 




plus 6% interest per year. Since no- 
body with any assets would ever be- 
come a colonist, and since it was 
next to impossible for a colonist, 
farming an unworked world, to ac- 
cumulate any capital, no case of an 
attempted buy-out had ever arisen. 

Until Burkhardt. He had done it, 
working round the clock, outpro- 
ducing his neighbors on Novotny 
IX and selling them his surplus, 
cabling his extra pennies back to 
Earth to be invested in blue-chip 
securities, and finally — after eigh- 
teen years — amassing the S 30, OOO- 
plus-accrued -interest that would 
spring him from indenture. 

Twenty billion people on nine 
worlds wanted to know why. 

The day after his return, he held 
a press conference in the hotel suite 
provided for him by the Coloniza- 
tion Bureau. Admission was strictly 
limited — one man from each of the 
twenty leading news services, no 
more. 

Wearing a faded purplish tunic 
and battered sandals, Burkhardt 
came out to greet the reporters. He 
looked tremendously dignified — an 
overbearing figure of a man, thin 
but solid, with enormous gnarled 
hands and powerful forearms. The 
gray in his hair gave him a patriar- 
chical look on a world dedicated to 
cosmetic rejuvenation. And his 
eyes, shining like twin beacons, 
roved around the room, transfixing 
everyone once, causing discomfort 
and uneasiness. No one had seen 
eyes like that on a human being be- 



fore. But no one had ever seen a re- 
turned colonist before, either. 

He smiled without warmth. 
“Very well, gentlemen. I’m at your 
disposal.” 

T hey started with the peripheral 
questions first. 

“What sort of planet is Novotny 
IX, Mr. Burkhardt?” 

"Cold. The temperature never 
gets above sixty. The soil is margi- 
nally fertile. A man has to work 
ceaselessly if he wants to stay alive 
there." 

“Did you know that when you 
signed up to go there?" 

Burkhardt nodded. “I asked fort 
the least desirable of the available 
colony worlds.” 

“Are there many colonists 
there?” 

“About twenty thousand, I 
think. It isn’t a popular planet, you 
understand.” 

"Mr. Burkhardt, part of the 
terms of the colonist’s indenture 
specify that me must marry. Did 
you fulfill this part of the 
contract?” 

Burkhardt smiled sadly. “I 
married less than a week after my 
arrival there in 2319. My wife died 
the first winter of our marriage. 
There were no children. I didn’t 
remarry.” 

“And when did you get the idea 
of buying up your indenture and re- 
turning to Earth?” 

“In my third year on Novotny 
IX."

GALAXY 




“In other words, you devoted 
fifteen years to getting back to 
Earth?” 

“That’s correct.” 

It was a young reporter from 
Transuniverse News who took the 
plunge toward the real meat of the 
universe. “Could you tell us why 
you changed your mind about re- 
maining a colonist? At the space- 
port you said something about 
there being a woman — ” 

“Yes.” Burkhardt chuckled 
mirthlessly. “I was pretty young 
when I threw myself into the coloni- 
zation plan — twenty-five, in point 
of fact. There was a woman; I loved 
her; she married someone else. I 
did the romantic thing and signed 
up for Novotny IX. Three years 
later, the newstap from Earth told 
me that she had been divorced. 
This was in 2322. I resolved to 
return to Earth and try to persuade 
her to marry me.” 

“So for fifteen years you 
struggled to get back so you could 
patch up your old romance," an- 
other newsman said. “But how did 
you know she hadn’t remarried in 
all that time?” 

“She did remarry,” Burkhardt 
said stunningly. 

“But — ” 

“I received word of her remar- 
riage in 2324, and of her subse- 
quent divorce in 2325. Of her re- 
marriage in 2327, and of her subse- 
quent divorce in 2329. Of her re- 
marriage in the same year, and her 
subsequent divorce in 2334. Of her 



remarriage in 2335, and of her di- 
vorce four months ago. Unless I 
have missed the announcement, 
she has not remarried this last 
time.” 

"Did you abandon your project 
every time you heard of one of these 
marriages?” 

Burkhardt shook his head. “I 
kept on saving. I was confident that 
none of her marriages would last. 
All these years, you see, she’s been 
trying to find a substitute for me. 
But human beings are unique. 
There are no substitutes. I weather- 
ed five of her marriages. Her sixth 
husband will be myself.” 

“Could you tell us — could you 
tell us the name of this woman, Mr. 
Burkhardt?” 

The returned colonist’s smile was 
frigid. “I'm not ready to reveal her 
name just yet,” he said. “Are there 
any further questions?” 

along toward mid-afternoon, 
Burkhardt ended the confer- 
ence. He had told them in detail of 
his efforts to pile up the money; he 
had talked about life as a colonist; 
he had done everything but tell 
them the name of the woman for 
whose sake he had done all this. 

Alone in the suite after they had 
gone, Burkhardt stared out at the 
other glittering towers of New 
York. Jet liners droned overhead; a 
billion lights shattered the dark- 
ness. New York, he thought, was as 
chaotic and as repugnant to him as 
ever. He missed Novotny IX. 



THE MAN WHO CAME BACK 



131 




But he had had to come back. 
Smiling gently, he opaqued the 
windows of his suite. It was winter, 
now, on Novotny IX 's colonized 
continent. A time for burrowing 
away, for digging in against the 
mountain-high drifts of blue-white 
snow. Winter was eight standard 
months long, on Novotny IX; only 
four out of the sixteen standard 
months of the planet’s year were 
really livable. Yet a man could see 
the results of his own labor, out 
there. He could use his hands and 
measure his gains. 

And there were friends there. 
Not the other settlers, though they 
were good people and hard 
workers. But the natives, the 
Euranoi. 

The survey charts said nothing 
about them. There were only about 
live hundred of them left, anyway, 
or so Donnoi had claimed. Burk- 
hardt had never seen more than a 
dozen of the Euranoi at any one 
time, and he had never been able to 
tell one from another. They looked 
like slim elves, half the height of a 
man, gray-skinned, chinless, sad- 
eyed. They went naked against 
their planet’s bitter cold. They lived 
in caves, somewhere below the sur- 
face. And Donnoi had become 
Burkhardt’s friend. 

Burkhardt smiled, remember- 
ing. He had found the little alien in 
a snowdrift, so close to dead it was 
hard to be certain one way or the 
other. Donnoi had lived, and had 
recovered, and had spent the winter 



in Burkhardt’s cabin, talking a 
little, but mostly listening. 

Burkhardt had done the talking. 
He had talked it all out, telling the 
little being of his foolishness, of his 
delusion that Lily loved him, of his 
wild maniac desire to get back to 
Earth. 

And Donnoi had said, when he 
understood the situation, “You will 
get back to Earth. And she will be 
yours. " 

That had been between the first 
divorce and the second marriage. 
The day ’the newstapes had brought 
word of Lily’s remarriage had 
nearly finished Burkhardt, but 
Donnoi was there, comforting, con- 
soling. and from that day on Burk- 
hardt never worried again. Lily’s 
marriages were made, weakened, 
broke up, and Burkhardt worked 
unfalteringly, knowing that when 
he returned to Earth he could have 
Lily at last. 

Donnoi had told him solemnly, 
"It is all a matter of channelling 
you r desires. Look: l lay dying in a 
snowdrift, and I willed you to find 
me. You came: l lived. " 

“But I’m not Euranoi,” Burk- 
hardt had protested. “My will isn’t 
strong enough to influence another 
person.” 

“Any creature that thinks can 
assert its will. Give me your hand, 
and / will show you. ” 

Burkhardt smiled back across 
fifteen years, remembering the feel 
of Donnoi’s limp, almost boneless 
hand in his own, remembering the 



132 



GALAXY 




stiff jolt of power that had flowed 
from the alien. His hand had 
tingled for days afterward. But he 
knew, from that moment, that he 
would succeed. 

B urkhardt had a visitor the 
next morning. A press confer- 
ence was scheduled again for the 
afternoon, and Burkhardt had said 
he would grant no interviews before 
then, but the visitor had been insis- 
tent. Finally, the desk had phoned 
up to tell Burkhardt that a Mr. 
Richardson Elliott was here, and 
demanded to see him. 

The name rang a bell. “Send him 
up,” Burkhardt said. 

A few minutes later, the elevator 
disgorged Mr. Richardson Elliott. 
He was shorter than Burkhardt, 
plump, pink-skinned, clean- 
shaven. A ring glistened on his 
finger, and there was a gem of some 
alien origin mounted on a stickpin 
near his throat. 

He extended his hand. Burk- 
hardt took it. The hand was care- 
fully manicured, pudgy, somehow 
oily. 

“You’re not at all as I pictured 
you.” Burkhardt said. 

“You are. Exactly.” 

“Why did you come here?” 
Elliott tapped the newsfax 
crumpled under his arm. He 
unfolded it, showing Burkhardt the 
front-page spread. “I read the 
story, Burkhardt. I knew at once 
who the girl — the woman — was. I 
came to warn you not to get in- 



volved with her.” 

Burkhardt’s eyes twinkled. “And 
why not?” 

“She’s a witch,” Elliott mutter- 
ed. “She’ll drain a man dry and 
throw the husk away. Believe me, 1 
know. You only loved her. I 
married her.” 

“Yes,” Burkhardt said. “You 
took her away from me eighteen 
years ago.” 

“You know that isn’t true. She 
walked out on you because she 
thought I could further her career, 
which was so. 1 didn't even know 
another man had been in the 
picture until she got that letter 
from you, postmarked the day your 
ship took off. She showed it to 
me — laughing. 1 can’t repeat the 
things she said about you, Burk- 
hardt. But I was shocked. My mar- 
riage to her started to come apart 
right then and there, even though it 
was another three years before we 
called it quits. She threw herself at 
me. I didn’t steal her from any- 
body. Believe me, Burkhardt.” 

“1 believe you.” 

Elliott mopped his pink fore- 
head. “It was the same way with all 
the other husbands. I’ve followed 
her career all along. She exists only 
for Lily Leigh, and nobody else. 
When she left me, it was to marry 
Alderson. Well, she killed him as 
good as if she’d shot him, when she 
told him she was pulling out. Man 
his age had no business marrying 
her. And then it was Michaels, and 
after him Dan Cartwright, and 



THE MAN WHO CAME BACK 



133 




then Jim Thorne. Right up the 
ladder to fame and fortune, leaving 
a trail of used-up husbands behind 
her." 

Burkhardt shrugged. “The past 
is of no concern to me.” 

“You actually think Lily will 
marry you?" 

“1 do," Burkhardt said. “She’ll 
jump at it. The publicity values will 
be irresistible. The sollie star with 
five broken marriages to million- 
aires now stooping to wed her 
youthful love, who is now a penni- 
less ex-colonist.” 

Elliott moistened his lips unhap- 
pily. “Perhaps you’ve got some- 
thing there," he admitted. “Lily 
might just do a thing like that. But 
how long would it last? Six months, 
a year — until the publicity dies 
down. And then she’ll dump you. 
She doesn’t want a penniless 
husband.” 

“She won’t dump me.” 

"You sound pretty confident, 
Burkhardt.” 

“I am.” 

For a moment there was silence. 
Then Elliott said, “You seem deter- 
mined to stick your head in the 
lion’s mouth. What is it — an ob- 
session to marry her?” 

“Call it that.” 

“It’s crazy. I tell you, she’s a 
witch. You’re in love with an imagi- 
nary goddess. The real Lily Leigh is 
the most loathsome female ever 
spawned. As the first of her five 
husbands, 1 can take oath to that.” 
“Did you come here just to tell 



me that?” 

“Not exactly," Elliott said. “I’ve 
got a proposition for you. I want 
you to come into my firm as a Vice 
President. You’re system-famous, 
and we can use the publicity. I’ll 
start you at sixty thousand. You’ll 
be the most eligible bachelor in the 
universe. We’ll get you a rejuvena- 
tion and you’ll look twenty-five 
again. Only none of this Lily Leigh 
nonsense. I'll set you up, you’ll 
marry some good-looking kid, and 
all your years on Whatsis Nine will 
be just so much nightmare." 

“The answer is no.” 

“I’m not doing this out of 
charity, you understand. I think 
you’ll be an asset to me. But I also 
think you ought to be protected 
against Lily. I feel I owe you some- 
thing, for what I did to you un- 
knowingly eighteen years ago.” 
“You don’t owe me a thing. 
Thanks for the warning, Mr. 
Elliott, but I don’t need it. And the 
answer to the proposition is No. I’m 
not for sale.” 

“1 beg you — ” 

“No.” 

Color flared in Elliott’s cheeks 
for a moment. He rose, started to 
say something, stopped. “All 
right,” he said heavily. “Go to Lily. 
Like a moth drawn to a flame. The 
offer remains, Mr. Burkhardt. And 
you have my deepest sympathy.” 

at his press conference that after- 
noon, Burkhardt revealed her 
name. The system’s interest was at 



134 



GALAXY 




peak, now; another day without the 
revelation and the peak would pass, 
frustration would cause interest to 
subside. Burkhardt told them. 
Within an hour it was all over the 
system. 

Glamorous Lily Leigh, for a de- 
cade and a half queen of the solido- 
Jilms, was named today as the 
woman for whom John Burkhardt 
bought himself out of indenture. 
Burkhardt explained that Miss 
Leigh, then an unknown starlet, 
terminated their engagement in 
2319 to marry California industria- 
list Richardson Elliott. The 
n'Hirriage, like Miss Leigh's four 
later ones, ended in divorce. 

"I hope now to make her my 
wife , " the mystery man from 
Novotny IX declared. “ After 
eighteen years I still love her as 
strongly as ever. " 

Miss Leigh, in seclusion at her 
Scottsdale. Arizona home following 
her recent divorce from sollie-dis- 
tributing magnate James Thorne, 
refused to comment on the state- 
ment. 

For three days. Lily Leigh re- 
mained in seclusion, seeing no one, 
issuing no statements to the press. 
Burkhardt was patient. Eighteen 
years of waiting teaches patience. 
And Donnoi had told him, as they 
trudged through the gray slush of 
rising spring, “ The man who 
rushes ahead foolishly forfeits all 
advantages in a contest of wills. ” 

Donnoi carried the wisdom of a 
race at the end of its span. Burk- 



hardt remained in his hotel suite, 
mulling over the advice of the little 
alien. Donnoi had never passed 
judgment on the merits and draw- 
backs of Burkhardt’ s goal; he had 
simply advised, and suggested, and 
taught. 

The press had run out of things 
to say about Burkhardt. and he de- 
clined to supply them with anything 
new to print. So, inevitably, they 
lost interest in him. By the third 
day, it was no longer necessary to 
hold a press conference. He had 
come back; he had revealed his love 
for the sollie queen, Lily Leigh; now 
he was sitting tight. There was 
nothing to do but wait for further 
developments, if any. And neither 
Burkhardt nor Lily Leigh seemed to 
be creating further developments. 

It was hard to remain calm, 
Burkhardt thought. It was queer to 
be here on Earth, in the quiet 
autumn, w hile winter fury raged on 
Novotny IX. Fury of a different 
kind raged here, the fury of a world 
of five billion eager, active human 
beings, but Burkhardt kept himself 
aloof from all that. Eighteen years 
of near-solitude had left him unfit 
for that sort of world. 

It was hard to sit quietly, though, 
w ith Lily just a visicall away. Burk- 
hardt compelled himself to be 
patient. She would call, sooner or 
later. 

She called on the fourth day. 
Burkhardt’s skin crawled as he 
heard the hotel operator say — in 
tones regulated only with enormous 



THE MAN WHO CAME BACK 



135 




effort — “Miss Leigh is calling from 
Arizona, Mr. Burkhardt," 

“Put the call on." 

She had not used the visi-circuit. 
Burkhardt kept his screen blank 
too. 

She said, withdut preliminaries, 
"Why have you come back after all 
these years, John?” 

“Because 1 love you." 

"Still?" 

“Yes." 

She laughed — the famous LL 
laugh, for his benefit alone. 
"You’re a bigger fool now than you 
were then, John.” 

“Perhaps.” he admitted. 

"1 suppose I ought to thank you, 
though. This is the best publicity 
I've had all year. And at my age I 
need all the publicity 1 can get." 

"I'm glad for you," he said. 

"You aren’t serious, though, 
about wanting to marry me, are 
you? Not after all these years. No- 
body stays in love that long.” 

"I did." 

“Damn you, what do you want 
from me?” The voice, suddenly 
shrill, betrayed a whisper of age. 

“Yourself.” Burkhardt said 
calmly. 

“What makes you think I’ll 
marry you? Sure, you’re a hero to- 
day. The Man Who Came Back 
From The Stars. But you’re 
nothing, John. All you have to show 
for eighteen years is callouses. At 
least back then you had your youth. 
You don’t even have that any 
more.” 



“Let me come to see you. Lily.” 
“1 don’t want to see you.” 
“Please. It’s a small thing — let 
me have half an hour alone with 
you." 

She was silent. 

"I've given you half a lifetime of 
love. L.ily. Let me have half an 
hour." 

After a long moment she said, 
simply, hoarsely, "All right. You 
can come. But I won’t marry you.” 

H e left New York shortly be- 
fore midnight. The Coloniza- 
tion Bureau had hired a private 
plane for him, and he slipped out 
unnoticed, in the dark. Publicity 
now would be fatal. The plane was 
a chemically powered jet, some- 
what out of date; they were using 
photon-rockets for the really fast 
travel. But. obsolete or no, it 
crossed the continent in three 
hours. It was just midnight, local 
time, when the plane landed in 
Phoenix. As they had arranged it, 
Lily had her chauffeur waiting, 
with a long, sleek limousine. Burk- 
hardt climbed in. Turbines 
throbbed; the car glided out toward 
Lily’s desert home. 

It was a mansion, a sprawled- 
out villa moated off — a moat, in 
water-hungry Arizona! — and topp- 
ed with a spiring pink stucco tower. 
Burkhardt was ushered through 
open fern-lined courtyards to an 
inner maze of hallways, and 
through them into a small room 
where Lily Leigh sat waiting. 



136 



GALAXY 




He repressed a gasp. She wore a 
gown worth a planet’s ransom, but 
the girl within the gown had not 
changed in eighteen years. Her face 
was the same, impish, the eyes 
dancing and gay. Her hair had lost 
none of its glossy sheen. Her skin 
was the skin of a girl of nineteen. 

"It’s like stepping back in time,” 
he murmured. 

"I have good doctors. You 
wouldn’t believe I'm forty, would 
you? But everyone knows it, of 
course.” She laughed. “You look 
like an old man, John.” 
"Forty-three isn’t old.” 

"It is when you let your age 
show. I’ll give you some money, 
John, and you can get fixed up. 
Better still. I’ll send my doctors to 
you." 

Burkhardt shook his head. “I’m 
honest about the passing of time. 1 
look this way because of what I’ve 
done these past eighteen years. 

I wouldn’t want a doctor’s skill to 
w ipe out the traces of those years." 

She shrugged lightly. “It was 
only an offer, not a slur. What do 
you want with me, John?” 

“I want you to marry me.” 

Her laughter was a silvery tinkle, 
ultimately striking a false note. 
“That made sense in 2319. It 
doesn't now. People would say you 
married me for my money. I’ve got 
lots of money, John, you know.” 
“I’m not interested in your 
money. I want you.” 

“You think you love me, but how 
can you? I’m not the sweet little girl 



you once loved. 1 never was that 
sweet iittle girl. I was a grasping, 
greedy little girl — and now I'm a 
grasping, greedy old woman who 
still looks like a little girl. Go away, 
John. I'm not for you.” 

"Marry me, Lily. We’ll be 
happy. I know we will.” 

“You're a stupid monomaniac.” 
Burkhardt only smiled. “It’ll be 
good publicity. After five marriages 
for profit, you’re marrying for love. 
All the worlds love a lover, Lily. 
You’ll be everyone’s sweetheart 
again. Give me your hand, Lily.” 
Like a sleepwalker, she extended 
it. Burkhardt took the hand, 
frowning at its coldness, its limp- 
ness. 

“But 1 don’t love you, John.” 
"Let the world think you do. 
That’s all that matters.” 

“1 don’t understand you. 
You — ” 

She stopped. Burkhardt’s grip 
tightened on her thin hand. He 
thought of Donnoi, a gray shadow' 
against the snow, holding his hand, 
letting the power flow from body to 
body, from slim alien to tall Earth- 
man. It is all a matter of channel- 
ling your desires, he had said. Any 
creature that thinks can learn how 
to assert its will. The technique is 
simple. 

Lily lowered her head. After a 
moment, she raised it. She was 
smiling. 

((YT won’t last a month," Rich- 
J[ardson Elliott grunted, at the

sight of the announcement in the 
paper. 

“The poor dumb bastard," Jim 
Thorne said, reading the news at 
his Martian ranch. “Falling in love 
with a dream-Lily that never 
existed, and'actually marrying her. 
She'll suck him dry.” 

On nine worlds, people read the 
story and talked about it. Many of 
them were pleased; it was the 
proper finish for the storybook 
courtship. But those who knew Lily 
L.eigh were less happy about it. 
“She's got some angle,” they said. 
"It's all a publicity stunt. She’ll 
drop hint as soon as the fanfare dies 
down. And she’ll drop him so hard 
lie won't ever get up.” 

Burkhardtand Lily were married 
on the tenth day after his return 
from space. It was a civil ceremony, 
held secretly. Their honeymoon trip 
was shrouded in mystery. While 
they were gone, gossip columnists 
speculated. How' could the brittle, 
sophisticated, much-married Lily 
be happy with a simple farmer from 
a colony-world? 

Two days after their return to 
Earth from the honeymoon. Burk- 
hardt and his wife held a joint press 
conference. It lasted only five 
minutes. Burkhardt, holding his 
wjfe’s hand tightly, said, “I’m 
happy to announce that Miss Leigh 
is distributing all of her possessions 
to charity. We’ve both signed up as 
indentured colonists and we’re 
leaving for Novotny IX tomorrow,” 

“Really, Miss Leigh?” 



“Yes.” Lily said. "1 belong at 
John’s side. We’ll work his old farm 
together. It’ll be the first useful 
thing I’ve ever done in my life.” 

The newsmen, thunderstruck, 
scattered to shout their story to the 
waiting worlds. Mr. and Mrs. John 
Burkhardt closed the door behind 
them. 

“Happy?” Burkhardt asked. 

Lily nodded. She was still smil- 
ing. Burkhardt, watching her 
closely, saw the momentary flicker 
ot her eyes, the brief clearing-away 
of the cloud that shrouded them — 
as though someone were trapped 
behind those lovely eyes, struggling 
to get out. But Burkhardt’s control 
never lapsed. Bending, he kissed 
her soft lips lightly. 

"Bedtime,” he said. 

“Yes. Bedtime." 

Burkhardt kissed her again. 
Donnoi had been right, he thought. 
Control was possible. He had 
channelled desire eighteen years, 
and now Lily was his. Perhaps she 
was no longer Lily as men had 
known her, but what did that 
matter? She was the Lily of his 
lonely dreams. He had created her 
in the tingling moment of a hand- 
shake, from the raw material of her 
old self. 

He turned off the light and began 
to undress. He thought w r ith cozy 
pleasure that in only a few weeks he 
would be setting foot once again on 
the bleak tundra of Novotny 
IX — this time, with his loving 
bride. *

The medicine shaker, the bone 
breaker. I have seen and been 
all these. It is nothing but 
trouble. 



I have sat on the good side of

women. It is nothing but 
trouble. 



M iss Dow leaned against the 
observation window. Her 
stomach revolted and she backed 
away. Unable to quell the nausea 



rising within her she clamped a 
hand to her mouth. 

Dr. Santell gently took her arm. 
led her away from the window and 
helped her to a couch facing away 
from the observation window. 

Nausea passed; Miss Dow smiled 
weakly. “You did warn me,” she 
said. 

Dr. Santell did not return the 
smile. “It takes getting used to. I’m 
a doctor and immune to gore, but 
still I find it unsettling. He’s a 
biological impossibility.” 

"Not even human,” Miss Dow 
suggested. 



139 



“That’s what the government 
sent you here to decide,” said Dr. 
Santell. "Frankly, I’m glad he’s no 
longer my responsibility.” 

“I want to look at him again.” 

Santell shrugged, lit a syntho. 
Together they walked back to the 
observation window. He seemed 
amused at her discomfort. 

Again, Miss Dow peered through 
the window. This time it was easier. 

A young man, tall and well- 
muscled, stood in the middle of the 
room. He was naked. His uncut 
black hair fell to the small of his 
back. 

His chest was slit with a gaping 
wound that bled profusely; his legs 
and stomach were soaked with 
blood. 

“Why is he smiling? What is he 
staring at?” she asked, unable to 
take her eyes off the figure before 
her. 

“1 don’t know,” said Dr. Santell. 
“Why don’t you ask him.” 

“Your sense of humor escapes 
me,” said Miss Dow through 
tightly closed lips. 

Dr. Santell grinned and shrug- 
ged. His synthetic cigarette reached 
the cut-off mark and winked out. 
The butt Hashed briefly as he 
tossed it into the wall disposal. 

“Doesn’t everything?” suggested 
Dr. Santell, trying not to laugh at 
his little joke. 

Miss Dow turned away from the 
window. Her look was sharp, 
withering. “Tell me about him,” 
she snapped, each word like ice. 



“How did he get — that way?” 

His amusement faded. He licked 
his lips nervously, nodded. “He has 
no name, at least no official name. 
We call him Joe. Sort of a nick- 
name. We gave him that name 
about — ” 

“Fascinating,” interrupted Miss 
Dow, “but I didn’t come here to be 
entertained by some droll little tale 
about his nickname.” 

“Friendly, aren’t you?” asked 
Santell, drily. A pity, he thought. If 
she knew how to smile she might 
have seemed attractive. 

“The government doesn’t pay me 
to be friendly. It pays me to do a 
job.” Her voice was cold, dispas- 
sionate. But she turned to face Dr. 
Santell in such a way that she 
would not see the bleeding man. 
“How long has he been like this?” 
“It’s all in my report. If you’d 
like to read it I could — ” 

“I’d prefer a verbal outline first. 
I’ll read your report later; I trust 
that it is a thorough one.” She eyed 
him sharply. 

“Yes, quite thorough,” Dr. 
Santell replied, the polite edge in 
his voice wearing thin. 

He turned away from Miss Dow, 
gazed in at the bleeding man. His 
words were clipped, impartial. “He 
is approximately twenty-three years 
old and has been as he is now since 
birth.” 

“Incredible!” said Miss Dow, 
fascinated in spite of herself. “All 
this is documented?” 

“Completely. There is no possi- 



140 



GALAXY 




bility of fakery. Nor point either, 
for that matter.” 

“Just as you say,” echoed Miss 
Dow, “what have you done to try to 
cure it? Is it some form of stig- 
mata?” 

Dr. Santell shook his head. “If 
this is stigmata, it is the most ex- 
treme case this world will ever see. 
Besides, it is inconceivable that a 
psychosomatic illness could cause 
such a drastic biological malfunc- 
tion.” 

“But surely some sort of sur- 
gery?" began Miss Dow. “Some 
sort of chemical therapy would — ” 

Dr. Santell shook his head em- 
phatically. “We've tried them all in 
the seven years he’s been here. 
Psycho-chemistry, primal recondi- 
tioning, bio-feedback-tried singly 
and together; none have had any 
effect. He’s a biological impossi- 
bility.” 

"What is his rate of bleeding?” 
she asked. 

“It varies,” said Dr. Santell. 
"Somewhere between two and three 
pints an hour.” 

“But it’s not possible!” exclaim- 
ed Miss Dow. “No one can — ” 

“He can and does,” interrupted 
Dr. Santell. “He doesn’t do any- 
thing normally. I can give you ten 
reasons why he should be dead. 
Don’t ask me why he isn’t.” 

Miss Dow turned her head 
around and stared at the silent 
figure standing in the center of the 
room. The bleeding man had not 
moved. The blood flowed evenly 



from the chest wound, gathering in 
a coagulating pool at his feet. 

"1’ve had enough.” She turned 
away from the window. “Show me 
to my office. I'm ready to read that 
report now.” 

T wo hours later, the last page of 
Dr. Santell’s report slipped 
from nerveless fingers. The bleed- 
ing man lay outside the parameters 
of human biology. By all rights he 
should have been dead, indeed, 
could never have lived. Her hands 
were a little unsteady as she punch- 
ed in Dr. Santell’s office on the 
videophone. His face appeared on 
the screen — and it was flushed. 

“Report to me immediately,” 
Miss Dow snapped. 

“1 doubt it, sweetheart,” said 
Dr. Santell, grinning. “I’m off the 
case, remember?” He drank some- 
thing out of a dark tumbler. 

“You’re drinking!” snapped 
Miss Dow. 

“Now that you mention it,” ad- 
mitted Dr. Santell agreeably. He 
gave her a lopsided grin. “Perhaps 
you would care to join me?” 

"You are a disgusting, undiscip- 
lined lout. And I should like to re- 
mind you that you are still respon- 
sible to me. You may be discharged 
from this case in your professional 
capacity, but your standing orders 
are to cooperate with me in any way 
possible.” 

“So I’m cooperating,” muttered 
Dr. Santell. “I’ll stay out of your 
way, you stay out of mine.” 



THE BLEEDING MAN 



141 




“I won’t tolerate this!” she 
raged. ‘‘Do you realize to whom 
you are talking?” 

Dr. Santell thought that over 
slowly. His face tightened. He did 
realize who she was. It sobered him 
a little. He tobk another drink from 
the tumbler to compensate. 

“Are you sober enough to answer 
a few questions?" 

He thought that over for a while 
too. “I’m drunk enough to answer 
any questions you have. I don’t 
think I could answer them sober,” 
he said. 

“I am trying to be understand- 
ing,” said Miss Dow, a note of con- 
ciliation in her voice. “I realize it is 
quite natural for you to resent me. 
After all, I am responsible for your 
termination at this installation.” 

Dr. Santell shrugged it off. He 
took another drink from the 
tumbler. 

“We’re both professionals. Dr. 
Santell,” reasoned Miss Dow. “We 
can’t let emotional considerations 
enter into this. There is no place for 
emotion here. Our goals must 
be — ” 

"Hell! That’s easy for you to 
say!” growled Dr. Santell. “You 
don’t have any!” 

“That's quite enough, thank 
you,” said Miss Dow, pressing her 
lips together in a tight, angry line. 

“No, it’s not enough — ” started 
Dr. Santell. “You can’t — ” 

“The subject is closed!” she 
shouted. 

There was an uneasy silence. 



Miss Dow broke it by changing 
the subject. “What about his 
parents?” she asked. 

"Didn’t you read my report?” 

“It said they committed suicide. 
It did not specify or go into anyde- 
tails. I have to know more than 
that. Your report was supposed to 
be thorough. You didn’t list your 
sources of information on his early 
life, for one thing. I need to 
know — ” 

“Ask Nahtari. He can tell you 
everything,” he said. He shrugged 
as if to say it was out of his hands. 

"Who?” 

“Nahtari. His uncle. He comes 
every week to visit his nephew. 
Nahtari used to exhibit him at the 
carnival until we discovered him 
and brought him here. If you’ll 
turn to the financial report near the 
back, you will see that we pay him a 
small gratuity for the privilege of 
studying his nephew. We pay him 
by the week and he stops in to pick 
up his check and talk to his 
relative.” 

“Did you say he talks to his rela- 
tive?” 

“Yeah. It’s pretty strange. Nah- 
tari talks to Joe every week for an 
hour. 1 don’t know if Joe under- 
stands anything that is said to him 
or even if Nahtari cares if he under- 
stands. I’ve never heard Joe re- 
spond in any way, not in the seven 
years I’ve been here.” 

“When does this Nahtari make 
his weekly visit?” 

“He’s here now in my office. He 



142 



GALAXY 




brings me a pint of whiskey every 
week. Makes it himself. You’d 
never believe how good — ” 

Miss Dow hit the dial-out button 
viciously, cutting him off in mid- 
sentence. 

She pushed the door open to Dr. 
Santell’s office. She hadn’t bother- 
ed to knock. Dr. Santell had his 
feet propped up on the edge of his 
desk. He held a drink in one hand 
and a deck of cards in the other. 
Across the desk from him sat a grey 
headed Indian dressed in faded 
blue jeans, cracked leather boots 
and a tattered flannel shirt. 

“I’ll see your dime and raise you 
a dime,” said Dr. Santell, 
slamming a dime onto the pile of 
change on the desk between them. 

“Are you Nahtari?” demanded 
Miss Dow, coming into the room. 
The two studiously ignored her. 

“It depends,” said the old In- 
dian, not looking up from his 
cards. “I'll meet your dime and 
raise you a quarter.” 

Dr. Santell bit his lip. “You’re 
bluffing! I know you don't have 
that other ace!" 

Miss Dow marched up to the 
desk, snatched the cards out of Dr. 
Santell’s hands. 

Dr. Santell pounded his desk in 
anger. “Stupid bitch! I had him 
beat!” He tried to collect the torn 
cards in his lap. 

“Is she some kind of nut?” asked 
Nahtari, holding his cards out of 
harm’s way. 

Dr. Santell dumped the torn 



pieces of cards on the top of the 
desk and sighed. "Yeah. A govern- 
ment nut. She’s in charge of Joe 
now.” 

Nahtari scowled and laid his 
cards face up on the desk. “And 
that means she wants to ask me 
about my relative.” 

“It certainly does,” said Miss 
Dow. “Would you like to come to 
my office?” 

Nahtari shrugged. There seemed 
to be no way to avoid it. 

“You are owing me twelve 
dollars,” he said to Dr. Santell as 
he rose to leave the room. 

“Don’t I always,” growled Dr. 
Santell, staring at the ace that Nah- 
tari had had after all. 

660 it down, Nahtari. This may 
^y ake a while. I have a great 
many questions I want to ask you.” 
She put a new cartridge in her tape 
machine and turned it on. 

“If Dr. Santell had taken down 
all facts from before when I tell him 
I would not having to be saying 
again,” said Nahtari. “I get tired of 
telling the story and having no one 
taking down so I don’t have to do 
all over again.” 

Miss Dow patted the tape ma- 
chine. "Don’t worry about it," she 
assured him. “This recorder will 
make a permanent record of every- 
thing you say. 1 guarantee you 
won’t have to tell it again.” 

“You going to listen and take 
down no matter what?” 

“Every word," she replied. 



THE BLEEDING MAN 



143 




She started to ask a question but 
Nahtari held up his hand. “Let me 
tell whole story,” said Nahtari. “It 
will be a saving of time and you can 
ask questions after if you have any. 
I want to get this over before too 
long. Got to-catch Dr. Santell be- 
fore he leave with my twelve 
dollar.” 

Nahtari scratched his chest over 
his right shirt pocket. 

“That sounds all right to me,” 
agreed Miss Dow. “Could you start 
with his parents? I’d like to 
know — ” 

“He killed them.” 

“What?” Miss Dow was stunned. 

“He killed them,” repeated Nah- 
tari matter-of-factly. “I was there 
the day he was born. His father and 
mother died within an hour of his 
birthing. He killed them.” 

Miss Dow was confused. “But 
how did it happen? How could — ” 

“You was not going to ask ques- 
tions until I finished,” accused 
Nahtari, dragging the back of his 
hand insolently across his nose. 

Miss Dow settled back into her 
seat with a tight-lipped smile. She 
motioned for him to continue. 

“His parents were medicine 
people. They were people of great 
power. My brother was one of the 
strong ones. They had this child 
stronger than them.” 

Miss Dow made a face. “You 
don't expect me to believe in primi- 
tive super — ” 

“I am expecting of you to keep 
your stupid mouth shut so this 



telling can be done and over with. I 
want to tell this so you will no 
longer pester me when I come to see 
my relative. I know all of your kind 
of government people. You harass 
a person — ” 

“Tell the story!” rasped Miss 
Dow. “For Christ sakes, just tell 
the story!” She drummed her 
fingers impatiently on the desk. 

“My brother and his woman 
were filled with the sickness of the 
world. I knew that my brother did 
not want to live. His wife knew this 
and was content to go with them. 
Then when they had decided the 
road, she became heavy with child. 
They had no expecting of this. They 
became uncertain and did not 
know the way. But they could not 
change their decision for the living 
of the child. They went into the 
mountains, looking for their road. 
It was in the fifth month of the 
child in her belly.” 

Miss Dow sighed impatiently and 
settled back in her chair. It looked 
to be a long story, unrestricted by 
the inclusion of anything factual. 
Already she regretted asking him 
for information. 

, “They were high in the moun- 
tains. They laid down for dying but 
something strange happened. The 
child began speaking to them. The 
child was angry. They ran to the 
high places, to throw themselves off 
before the power of the child got 
too strong for them. But the child 
stopped them at the edge of the cliff 
and turned them around. The child 



144 



GALAXY 




forced them back down the moun- 
tain. And for four months, they 
were prisoners of the child.” 

“Are you seriously telling me 
that — ” began Miss Dow with 
disgust. 

Nahtari snorted contemptuously 
and passed his hands in front of his 
eyes. His eyes seemed to be focused 
on some far horizon. His voice 
mocked hers. “I just had a vision. I 
saw you and Dr. Santell embraced 
upon the ground and then suddenly 
crushed by a falling outhouse.” 
“I’m not laughing,” said Miss 
Dow. She wasn’t laughing. 

“Somebody is,” said Nahtari 
with a straight face. “I knew you 
was going to not let me finish the 
story and take it all down so I don’t 
have to tell it again. Nobody ever 
lets me finish my story,” com- 
plained Nahtari. 

“Christ! I don’t blame them!” 
said Miss Dow. “I’ve never heard 
such an outrageous piece of trash.” 
She turned the tape machine off. 
“You may have all the time in the 
world but I haven’t got time to 
listen to this idiocy!” She stood up 
and marched around the desk. 
“When you leave, shut the door.” 
Nahtari came around the desk 
and sat down in her chair. He tilted 
the chair back and rested his boot- 
heels on the desk. He turned the 
tape recorder microphone around 
so that it pointed at him. He 
pushed the recording button and 
began talking into the machine. 
“You bet this time, record is 



made of all the facts,” he said and 
went on with the story. “For four 
months, they were prisoners of the 
child. Five days before he was born, 
the child began to fear leaving the 
belly. The fear did not last long but 
it lasted long enough for his father 
to put poison in their food without 
the child’s knowing. They ate this 
poison, the mother, the father and 
the child. 

“The child felt the poison and 
changed it into water in his belly. 
He felt great sadness in his heart 
and an anger because they did not 
want him to live. They did not want 
him born into a world they had 
grown sick of. It was not their right 
to choose for him because his power 
was greater than theirs. He did not 
change the poison flowing through 
them to water. His hatred was at 
them for they had let the world beat 
them. They began the agony of 
poison dying but they could not die. 

“I sat with them through this 
time. I sat with my brother and my 
sister by law and they told me these 
things through their agony. They 
screamed to die but the child was 
punishing them for letting the 
world beat them. I, Nahtari, did 
not want to see the child born into 
this world. I feared his coming. 
There was nothing I could do. He 
came to birth. 

“It was not a child like expected. 
He bled. His chest was bleeding. I 
had expected hot roaring fires. I 
had expected a child of frightful 
appearance. It was but a small 



THE BLEEDING MAN

baby that bled and could not talk. 

“The father pulled the baby up 
and beat him into breathing. He 
laid the baby on the bed and went 
outside the house. After a little 
while, my sister by law got to her 
feet, swaying 'on dizzy legs, and she 
staggered out after him. I tried to 
stop the bleeding of the baby chest 
but I was too scared about my 
brother and sister by law. I ran out- 
side. They laid side by side in the 
black dirt of the garden. They were 
dead and five days decayed. 

“I took the little one into my 
home but the bleeding sickened my 
old woman and she died. So I took 
the bleeding one to the traveling 
show. The white people there did 
not sicken and die at the sight of his 
bleeding. 

“In lines all around the tent they 
would stand to pay good money to 
see the bleeding one. They all 
wanted to see him bleeding and 
they were not sickened by it and 
they did not die. But the govern- 
ment people came and took the 
bleeding man from me and made 
me sign little pieces of paper and 
gave me money so they could do 
what they do. I turned him over to 
the government ones and that is all 
there is to the story and it is the 
truth. 

“Now I come every week to talk 
to him. 1 know he is too powerful to 
have a name. I am waiting for him. 
1 am telling so I will not have to tell 
it again and so that this warning is 
given to all who would have 



dealings with him. He is not ready 
to do what he will one day do. Do 
not walk in his shadow. Leave him 
alone for he is not you. For twenty- 
three years he has been gathering 
power. That is all I have to say.” 
He switched off the tape ma- 
chine, smiling to himself because 
there was no one to hear it. He 
closed the door carefully behind 
him and went looking for Dr. 
Santell and his twelve dollars. 

M iss Dow pushed open the 
door cautiously. She was not 
sure if she had the stomach for 
what she was doing. But making up 
her mind, she stepped into the 
room. She kept telling herself that 
he was perfectly harmless. 

The drain in the center of the 
floor was stopped up with clotted 
blood. He stood in a shallow pool of 
his own blood. His body was 
motionless, his breathing just 
barely perceptible by a slight rising 
and falling of his chest. The blood 
flowed steadily to the floor. 

“Can you hear me?” she asked 
nervously. She shut the door 
behind her. She kept her eyes on 
his face. He stared at her but gave 
no sign that he had heard her. He 
seemed to be in no pain, despite the 
stream of blood flowing down his 
chest. 

“I’m not going to hurt you." She 
approached him slowly with a 
small, glass lab beaker. Averting 
her eyes slightly, she placed the 
glass container below the wound. 



146 



GALAXY 




She felt a little foolish for having 
spoken to him. It was obvious to 
her now that he was little better 
than a cretin and that he could not 
understand a word she said. 

She stood there awkwardly, the 
glass beaker filling with his blood. 
The naked man seemed unaware of 
her presence, yet still she felt an un- 
reasonable fear. There was some- 
thing frightening about the still 
figure. Something threatening, 
otherworldly in the steady flow of 
blood down his chest. He did not 
seem vulnerable. Rather it was as if 
the world were too insignificant for 
him to notice it. 

She backed away with a full glass 
of his blood. She felt better with 
each step she took. He stared at 
her, no expression on his face, his 
eyes unusually bright. She had felt 
very uncomfortable under his stare. 

Miss Dow had turned and 
started out the door, watching him 
alL the while. Suddenly he moved. 
She turned quickly. Fear rose in 
her like a tide. The bleeding man 
cupped a hand beneath the wound 
in his chest. 

Slowly, he brought his hands to 
his lips and drank. Miss Dow 
fainted. 

D r. santell found her in the 
doorway. A tiny, red pool of 
fresh blood was beginning to 
blacken on the floor beside her 
head. The glass beaker she had 
brought into the room was gone. 
“What happened?” asked Dr. 



Santell, bending over the couch, his 
voice oddly gentle despite its gruff- 
ness. “Here — take a sip of this,” he 
said, offering her a small glass of 
whiskey. “It’ll steady your nerves.” 

She was too weak to refuse. The 
whiskey burned her throat and 
made her cough. He made her take 
another sip. It almost made her gag 
but it seemed to help. A touch of 
color reappeared in her face. 

“He — he — he drank his own 
blood!” she whispered, tottering on 
the edge of hysteria. 

Dr. Santell leaned forward 
eagerly. His features sharpened, his 
manner became intent and force- 
ful. “Are you sure?” he demanded. 

“Yes, I’m sure,” she said with a 
trace of her normal sharpness. 

“Are you sure — absolutely sure — 
he drank his own blood?” he asked 
again, impatiently. The answer 
seemed unusually important to 
him. 

“Of course. I’m sure, damn it! It 
was absolutely disgusting!” She 
wrinkled up her nose, “That revolt- 
ing animal did it on purpose! Just 
because I collected a beaker of — ” 

Dr. Santell suddenly became 
greatly agitated. “You collected a 
glass of blood?” he husked. 

She nodded, bewildered by his 
strange behavior. 

“God! It’s happened again,” he 
muttered. “It’s happened again!” 
A look of dread passed over his 
face. 

“What the devil are you talking 
about?” demanded Miss Dow. 



THE BLEEDING MAN 



147 




“When I heard you scream, I 
started running, I was the first one 
to reach you. You were sprawled in 
the doorway. There was a big 
bloodstain beside your head on the 
floor. There was no glass on the 
floor of the rdom and it wasn’t in 
the hallway.” 

“Don’t be ridiculous! I had it 
with me. Isn’t this an awfully big 
fuss to be making over a — ” 

Dr. Santell turned his back on 
her and dialed security. 

“Hobeman? This is Santell. 
Have room 473 searched for a glass 
beaker. Delay his feeding time if 
you have to, but find that beaker!” 
He shut off the view screen. 

He looked at Miss Dow. Her face 
was blank with bewilderment. Be- 
fore she could ask a question he 
began, “Something strange has 
developed in the last few weeks. 
Our monitors have been picking up 
unusual activity levels. They aren’t 
sophisticated enough to tell us. 
exactly what’s happening but his 
heartbeat and galvanic skin re- 
sponses have been fluctuating 
wildly.” 

“But what does that have to do 
with the glass?” asked Miss Dow. 

“I’m coming to that. A week 
ago, during one of his strange activ- 
ity levels, the observation port on 
the wall of his room disappeared.” 

Miss Dow’s face registered 
shock. “Disappeared? How is that 
possible?” 

Dr. Santell was grim. “I have no 
idea. We found traces of melted 



glass on the floor of the room. But 
what disturbs me the most is that 
we could detect no coronary 
activity. For two hours his blood 
was circulating but his heart wasn’t 
functioning,” 

“He's not human, is he?” said 
Miss Dow'. 

“I don’t know,” said Dr. Santell, 
staring off into space. “1 just don’t 
know.” 

H e pushed the carts through 
the door. The bleeding man 
stared at him as he had stared for 
the seven years he had been there. 

“Soup’s on, Joe,” said the man 
with the feeding carts. 

Two men hidden from view by 
the door, were examining two 
streaks of melted glass on the floor. 

“Hey, hold up there,” said one of 
the men. “He’s not to be fed until 
we’ve finished our search.” 

“1 won’t get in the way. What’s 
disappeared this time?" 

“Nothing important,” grumbled 
one of the men. “Just a glass jar 
from the lab.” 

“Shame on you, Joe,” said the 
cartman, waving a finger at the 
motionless figure in the center of 
the room. “You oughten to be 
stealing stuff like that.” He opened 
the top of his cart and took out a 
pair of gloves. 

“It won’t hurt if I feed him will 
it? 1 don’t have to hose him down 
until you guys have finished,” he 
said, pulling the gloves over his 
hands. 



148 



GALAXY 




“Go ahead. We aren’t going to 
find anything anyway.” 

The cart man opened a panel on 
the side of the cart and brought out 
a bowl of raw meat. He sat it on the 
floor in front of the bleeding man. 
From the other cart he got a large 
bowl of uncooked vegetables and a 
large wooden ladle. 

He detached a water hose from 
the wall and started backing 
toward the bleeding man, uncoiling 
the hose as he walked. When he got 
to the end of the hose, he turned 
around. 

The bleeding man had overturn- 
ed the feeding bowls with his feet. 
He was drinking his own biood 
from cupped hands. 

ffrpHis is what you are looking 
l for,” said Dr. Santell, hand- 
ing Miss Dow a clipboard. “His 
blood type is O lateral. We’ve run 
hundreds of tests on it and it seems 
to be perfectly normal blood, a 
little more resistant to some 
diseases than ordinary blood but 
otherwise normal. It’s too bad the 
government won’t let us use his 
blood. He’s a universal donor and 
at the rate he produces blood, I’ll 
bet he could supply Intercity all by 
himself.” 

“But that’s just the point. We 
are going to use his blood,” said 
Miss Dow. “We are going to use his 
blood,” said Miss Dow. “We are 
going to use a lot more besides. 
That’s why I was sent here.” 

“The government’s changed its 



policy, then?” asked Dr. Santell. 
“Why?” 

“We’ve given transfusions of his 
blood to prisoners and it seems to 
have no bad effects. Tell me, you've 
studied him for seven years. Do you 
have any idea how something like 
him is possible?” 

Dr. Santell lit a synthetic ciga- 
rette slowly. He gave her a curious 
look. 

“Did you listen to Nahtari’s ex- 
planation?” 

“That lunacy,” sniffed Miss 
Dow. “I think we should pay a little 
more attention to a chromosomal 
mutation theory than some wild 
story from some primitive like 
Nahtari.” 

Dr. Santell shrugged. “It doesn’t 
really matter what caused it. I 
couldn’t even make an educated 
guess. His version is the only evi- 
dence we have.” 

“Confine yourself to specifics, 
please,” said Miss Dow. “What 
biological evidence do we have?” 

“There is biological evidence 
pointing to chromosomal differen- 
tiation. He has sixty-four paired 
chromosomes. I have been unable 
so far to determine their exact 
structure. He seems to have all the 
normal ones. Technically, that 
makes him a member of our 
species, I suppose. But it’s those 
extra chromosomes that are so un- 
usual. They seem to be entirely new 
structures unlike anything we are 
familiar with. It must be something 
outside our experience. I think I

pointed this out in more detail in 
my report.” 

“But technically, he is human?” 
asked Miss Dow. 

“1 would say he is,” said Dr. 
Santell. 

“Very well. Then I am going to 
give the final go-ahead on this pro- 
ject,” said Miss Dow. 

“And what project is that?” 

“We’re going to transfer him to 
the military dome at Intercity 
where he will be dissected for tissue 
regeneration. Hopefully, his cellu- 
lar matrix will produce like func- 
tioning biological constructs.” 

“What!” Dr. Santell jumped to 
his feet. “You’re not serious! That 
would be murder! Matrix recon- 
struction from tissue cultures has 
never advanced beyond the experi- 
mental stage! We don’t have the 
technology to stimulate the repro- 
duction of brain and nerve tissue! 
Good lord, woman, you can’t 
seriously — ” 

“I am quite aware of our short- 
comings in the field of tissue re- 
generation,” said Miss Dow coldly. 
“For years, our work in this area 
has been little better than a waste 
of time and materials. We have yet 
to produce a successful unit with a 
well-developed nervous system. Nor 
have we been able to successfully 
clone an individual. These matters, 
however, are not relevant to this 
case.” 

“Not relevant! You’ll kill him! 
And to what purpose? A line of re- 
search that you yourself admitted 



has been a waste of time!” stormed 
Dr. Santell, his face flushed with 
anger. 

“Be careful. Dr. Santell,” she 
cautioned him. “1 don’t think I am 
happy with your choice of words. 
We are not going to kill him. Many 
of our first tissue regeneration ex- 
periments are still alive — alive after 
a fashion, that is. Their bodies still 
function, their cells still grow, it is 
only their minds that are dead.” 
She smiled. 

“It’s still murder! You have no 
right!” Dr. Santell looked away 
from Miss Dow. He had suddenly 
realized that the things he was 
saying could be considered treason. 

“When’s the last time you had an 
attitude check, Dr. Santell?” asked 
Miss Dow. “I almost thought I 
heard you say something that was 
opposed to the wishes of our 
government. You did agree that my 
patient can be made ready for 
transport tomorrow morning, 
didn’t you?” 

“Of course,” said Dr. Santell. 
“He will be ready,” 

“And did I hear you use the word 
murder, Dr. Santell? I did hear you 
use the word! I’m sure General 
Talbot will be most interested in 
your attitude.” 

Dr. Santell turned and began 
walking out of the room. He knew 
that he was in trouble and nothing 
he could say would make it any 
better. 

“Dr. Santell!” 

He turned to look at her.

“I’m really not hard to get along 
with,” said Miss Dow. “You have 
the reputation of being a brilliant 
scientist. I’ve handled your type be- 
fore. I am willing to overlook a 
small measure of eccentricity. But 1 
draw the line at treason.” 

His expression remained blank. 
“It’s only natural that you’re de- 
fensive about your patient after 
seven years,” she soothed. “You 
have personalized him, lost your 
objectivity. But you must know as 
well as' I do that the bleeding man is 
a brainless vegetable, hopelessly re- 
tarded since birth. You can see 
that, surely?” 

Dr. Santell stared wordlessly. 

"It would be a lot easier for me,” 
she continued, “if I had your 
cooperation on this thing. You’ve 
had seven years experience on this 
project and you could help us 
smooth over any rough spots we 
might encounter. This isn’t exactly 
a normal case. It will require 
special procedures. Procedures that 
your cooperation will make pos- 
sible." She smiled at him. “My re- 
port could be a very positive one. It 
depends on you.” 

Dr. Santell forced himself to 
smile. “Believe me," he said. “I 
shall cooperate in any way 1 can. I 
apologize for my behavior.” 

Miss Dow' nodded. “Good. Now, 
how much blood could, let’s say, 
ten of his regenerations, produce in 
a forty-eight hour period?” 

Dr. Santell began punching up 
figures on his desk calculator. 



T he bleeding man continued to 
drink. The men studying the 
glass streaks on the floor had fled. 

A security guard unlocked the 
door and looked into the room. The 
bleeding man did not seem aware 
of the other’s presence. A call went 
out for Dr. Santell. 

Dr. Santell, followed by Miss 
Dow, arrived just in time to see the 
heavy door buckling outward. 

"He’s gone berserk!” screamed 
Miss Dow, as the door was battered 
off its hinges. The bleeding man 
walked through the wreckage of the 
door. He advanced upon them, a 
crimson trail of blood behind him 
on the floor. 

Miss Dow fled, screaming. Dr. 
Santell stood his ground. The 
bleeding man brushed him lightly 
as he walked past. He looked 
neither to left or right. He strode 
down the corridor, moving quickly, 
relentlessly. 

Dr. Santell ran in front of him 
and tried to push him to a halt. His 
hands slipped, coming away blood 
soaked. His efforts to stop him were 
futile. Through the plasti-glass cor- 
ridor walls he could see the security 
guards gathering around Miss Dow 
at the corridor exit. Dr. Santell 
took hold of the bleeding man’s 
arm and tried to drag him to a stop 
but found himself being dragged 
instead. The bleeding man did not 
even break stride. 

Miss Dow stood within a cordon 
of security men. Dr. Santell knew 
what she would order them to do 



THE BLEEDING MAN 



151 




even before the bleeding man 
smashed through the exit door. 

“Aim for his head!” she shouted. 

A burst of stunner fire took the 
bleeding man full in the face. He 
walked several steps, then toppled. 

Dr. Santell rushed to his side and 
put a hand on his chest. “He's still 
alive,” he muttered to himself. 

“Good shooting, men,” congrat- 
ulated Miss Dow. “A couple of you 
men carry the body down to the 
lab.” 

“Is there very much damage to 
his head?” she asked. “Is he still 
alive? Not that it matters. We can’t 
risk another episode like this. We 
might as well do the dissection 
here. It'll make him easier to 
handle. We'd have to ship him 
frozen anyway now that we know 
more about his capabilities.” 

The security men carried the 
body away. 

“He's still alive,” Dr. Santell 
said, pronouncing each word slowly 
and distinctly. "He’s very much 
alive.” 

M iss Dow had a surgical gown 
on and a mask. “Are you sure 
you can handle the dissection all by 
yourself. Dr. Santell? I could fly 
someone in to assist.” 

"Quite sure,” said Dr. Santell, 
bending over the still form on the 
surgery table. “I’ll begin soon. 
You'd better leave now.” 

“I’ll be waiting at the military 
base in Intercity for the body," said 
M iss Dow . She came over to the 



table and stood beside him. Her 
voice was cold and emotionless as 
usual. “You realize I still must re- 
port your treasonable remarks to 
General Talbot." 

Dr. Santell nodded, not looking 
in her direction. 

"However, your behavior has 
shown marked improvement. That 
too will be noted in my report. Try- 
ing to stop this creature single- 
handedly in the corridor like you 
did was a very brave if somewhat 
foolish thing to do. You realize of 
course that the matter is out of my 
hands. General Talbot will be the 
one deciding, not I. Perhaps, after 
a short period of retraining, you 
may even be reassigned. A man of 
your reputation. I'm sure, will find 
it very easy to rejoin the fold. Only 
a fool — or a traitor — bucks the 
system.” 

Dr. Santell seemed not to be 
listening. He stuck a needle into the 
arm of the body on the dissection 
table. 

“What a shame a body like tht 
should have no mind.” mused Miss 
Dow . “Just think of the power he 
must have in order to smash 
through those doors like he did." 

“Yes," Dr. Santell replied tone- 
lessly. 

Miss Dow pulled her mask off 
and turned to leave. 

“Wait,” said Dr. Santell. “Be- 
fore you go, could you hand me 
that box of clamps under the table 
here?” 

She bent over and looked under 



152 



GALAXY 




the table. “I don't see any — ” 

His scalpel sliced through her 
right carotid artery. Her body 
jerked convulsively and she crashed 
heavily (o the door. 

“Yes." said Dr. Santell with a 
strange look on his face. “It is 
always a shame to find a good body 
with a defective mind." 

It took him a little over two hours 
to dissect her. By the time he 
finished, the stimulant he had in- 
jected into him had brought the 
bleeding man back to conscious- 
ness. 

As he was putting her dismem- 
bered body into the liquid nitrogen 
packs for shipping, he kept his eyes 
on the body of the bleeding man. 
The body sat up slowly and opened 
its eyes. The head swiveled and the 
eyes regarded him. The eyes were 
alive with raw intelligence. The 
body slid off the table gracefully 
and stood up, the wound on his 
chest completely healed. 

“1 knew," said Dr. Santell. “1 
knew.” 

The medicine shaker, the bone 
breaker. I have seen and been 
all these. It is nothing but 
trouble. 

I have sat on the good side of 
the tire. I have cried over young 
women. It is nothing but 
trouble. 

These are the words I heard 
written in his skin. He made me 



kill her. I had to do it. I am not 
sorry. I knew. That is enough, 
knowing. — Paul Santell 

(This suicide note was found 
near the charred body of Dr. Paul 
Santell. who Intercity Police say, 
apparently soaked himself with an 
inflammable liquid and then set 
himself afire. Dr. Paul Santell, 
twice recipient of the Nobel Prize in 
psycho-chemistry, police report 
had been experiencing . — ex- 
cerpt from Intercity Demographic 
Area Telepaper.) 



T he bleeding man cured of 
bleeding, walked without haste 
toward the door leading outside. 
He remembered the taste of blood, 
he who no longer had need of it. He 
pushed the door open and stepped 
outside. The sky pulled at him but 
he resisted for that last little mo- 
ment. His feet touched the ground. 
His lungs filled with air. His eyes 
danced on the horizons of the 
world. Raising his hands into the 
air, he let the sky pull him away 
from the earth. He took the air in 
his lungs and thrust it out with a 
shout. Silently his lips formed 
words. 

And then he had no more need of 
air and words. His fingers curled 
into the hands of the sky. He disap- 
peared in a cloud. 

He Who No Longer Bleeds is 
gone. He will return. To bleed 
again. * 



THE BLEEDING MAN

Dear Jim, 

I'd appreciate it if you’d run the 
following letter for me. I don’t 
think science fiction writers ought 

[ lightly to get involved in politics, 
but this is an issue close to most of 
our readers, and one I think we’ll 
have universal agreement on. 
t If you eat tuna fish, think about 

‘ changing diets. For hundreds of 
years tuna were caught by hook and 
line, but in the last decade “por- 
poise fishing” for tuna became 
widespread and is now nearly uni- 
versal. This involves using speed- 
boats to terrify dolphins into enter- 
ing purse seine nets. The tuna 
follow the terrified dolphins. 

The net is then drawn closed, 
and the result is unimaginably 
cruel to the dolphins. Most of them 
don’t survive the experience. In 
1972 Congress passed a law pro- 
tecting dolphins, and a new kind of 
net that reduced fatalities from 
millions to merely hundreds of 
thousands of dolphins was intro- 
duced. I’m told there’s now a net 
that gets it down to maybe a 
dolphin per ton of tuna, which 



means you haven’t contributed to 
more than a small percent of the 
murder of a dolphin when you buy 
a can of tuna — but isn’t that too 
many? 

If you like tuna but don’t like 
dead dolphins, albacore and skip- 
jack are still caught by methods not 
involving “porpoise fishing,” but 
those are hard to find. 

And if you’re upset about this, 
you might write your Congressman 
and demand that something be 
done about it. I understand Con- 
gress is considering a law that will 
let tuna fishers buy a license to kill 
dolphins in connection with their 
fishing. 

I try to be a reasonable man, and 
I recall many friends who were 
fishing boat captains when I lived 
in Seattle. They aren’t evil, but they 
have to make a living. So long as 
anyone is allowed to use “porpoise 
fishing,” then everyone who wants 
to stay in the fishing business must, 
because it is just so much more 
effective than the old methods. 

And certainly any effective re- 
striction on the tuna industry that 
makes them stop killing dolphins 
as part of their catching system will 
raise the price of tuna considerably. 
Me, I’m willing to pay a dime a can 
more if they’ll leave our sea-going 
cousins alone — and thinks naive 
me, so would almost everyone in 
the U.S. if they knew about it. 

You can learn more about this by 
sending $3.00 to “The Porpoise 
News,’’ 1945 Twentieth Ave., San 
Francisco, Calif. 94116.

murder most foul. 

Dear Editor, 

With the exception of Heinlein, 
and a very few others, sf today 
seldom measures up to the high 
standards of the fifties. I can think 
of a lot of reasons why this is so, but 
would like to share just a few of 
these reasons with you. 

The first reason why today’s sf is 
generally inferior is that some of it 
is highly experimental in form or 
concept. Eventually the art of sf 
will be advanced by these experi- 
ments, but for now we’ll have to 
suffer through them. 

Another reason for the inferior sf 
seems to be that authors are not so 
content to be entertainers, but are 
reaching — and overreaching — for 
the Big Concept. To be both a graet 
writer and an outstanding Big- 
Concept-person is extremely rare, 
but the authors do not know this, 
or think that they are exceptions. 

Still another reason for inferior sf 
seems to be the desire to imitate 
Leiber and Tolkien — and alas, the 
imitations are worse than blank 
pages. These imitations seem to 
combine with a love for the middle 
ages or the renaissance. So we have 
jarring cases of medieval societies 
on other planets or in the future. A 
man rides up to a castle on a horse 
and pulls out his laser gun, or per- 
haps some other unbelievable mix- 
ture of two technologies occurs. 

Perhaps editors are also at fault 
for the low estate of sf at present. I 
hesitate to say that, because I know 
an editor has to be awfully sharp 
just to keep a magazine operating 



at a profit. Anyone can write, more 
or less, but no one is an editor-more 
or-less; an editor either cuts the 
mustard or his magazine goes 
under. Precious few mortals can do 
it. Yet 1 suspect that, among the 
thousands of manuscripts that 
Galaxy receives each year, there 
must be three-hundred or so that 
I'd much prefer to read, rather 
than those actually published. 
Could it be that editors become too 
sophisticated? Could it be that a 
panel of sf fans would choose to 
publish manuscripts that would de- 
light the public and make editors 
vomit? Perhaps an editor should set 
up such a panel and find out. 

I really do not mind when an 
author inserts a bit of the occult or 
ESP, but wish he would take 
special care to make it believable. 

The kind of sf that 1 like to read 
has clarity; one does not have to 
read the last half of the story in 
order to understand the first half. 
Nor does one have to put a lot of 
clues together to make sense of the 
piece. The story may not present a 
conflict or problem (a conflict or 
problem usually helps the story 
along), but it should be fun and 
interesting to read from the be- 
ginning through the middle to the 
end. I am not satisfied with a story 
just because it has a terrific ending, 
no matter how carefully the ending 
has been prepared by the story as a 
whole. 

Much of the sf of today is so 
tedious, I cannot imagine even the 
authors writing it with any 
pleasure. Heinlein, in his speech at 
the Naval Academy, said: “If it 
bores me, I don’t write it.” The 
other authors should take that 



156

statement to heart!

/ think you are about 70% (60%) 
correct, and I hope Galaxy/IF re- 
flects this. However, consider: by 
the nature of things the readership 
of this and every magazine repre- 
sents a spectrum of tastes, and 
what you love someone else might 
think shallow and done-to-death. 
Or the reverse might be true. 

Personally, I go for action-adven- 
ture stories with a philosophical 
foundation, and which contain a 
valid scientific postulate integral to 
the plot, and which have believable 
characters with whom / can form a 
"relationship." And, of course, the 
author must write clean, concise 
prose which nonetheless has a de- 
gree of elegance ... I don't get 
many stories like that. 

Dear Mr. Baen: 

In your September issue, Mr. 
Pournelle commented on building 
materials in his article “A Step Far- 
ther Out.” He asks why we are so 
concerned with iron and steel since 
aluminum is so plentiful and notes 
that fiberglass and plastics haven’t 
begun to be exploited. In the case 
of the latter materials he feels that 
building codes have not caught up 
with technology. 

Actually, building codes are 
largely responsible in both in- 
stances. Remember that the reason 
for the building code is public 
safety. This is primarily expressed 
in concern for structural adequacy 
and fire safety. Although alumi- 
num has replaced steel and other 



metals to an enormous extent in 
modern construction, its physical 
properties have placed a limit on its 
use. I know of no architect or 
builder who would not be overjoyed 
at being offered aluminum door or 
window openings that would pass 
standard fire tests. Ignoring any 
weight/strength/cost factors, fur- 
ther structural use of aluminum is 
possible now, but it fails in one very 
large and important area. Alumi- 
num does not successfully interact 
with concrete (still one of our least 
expensive, most flexible, and avail- 
able materials) to provide that 
special strength, fire resistance, 
durability and economy that ferro- 
concrete construction offers. Also, 
no available aluminum alloy can 
substitute for stainless steel in 
corrosion resistance. 

Despite opposition from affected 
groups, the code acceptance of 
plastics has increased greatly in the 
last few years. In several instances 
performance has not lived up to the 
requirements and this has delayed 
further acceptance. The problem is 
still one of technology. Better com- 
binations of physical properties are 
needed. Aging sometimes produces 
unfortunate effects in either ap- 
pearance or durability. A material 
may offer many desirable features 
but prove hazardous in an actual 
fire. A great substitute for glass can 
not take standard maintenance 
practices. 1 am sure that composite 
materials have a great future but 
we are waiting for better products 
and for more information, especial- 
ly on the effects of time and on the 
results of fuller and more realistic 
testing procedures. 

Very truly yours,

Jerry’s reply follows: 

I believe my column made it 
clear I was speaking of plastics, 
fiberglass, and composites as being 
hampered by lagging codes; al- 
though it took long enough to get 
codes revised to allow exploitation 
of aluminum. Nor did I blame 
codes as the only reason for appli- 
cation lagging technology, although 
a pretty good case can be made for 
their being a prime cause. 

Mr. Robinson is as aware as I am 
that building codes are not pri- 
marily concerned with public safety 
(although certainly they must pro- 
tect that) but with resale value and 
protection of moneylenders. Most 
housing is financed by someone 
other than the owner, and it is diffi- 
cult to raise capital for a structure 
unless the lender can be certain the 
building will outlast the mortgage. 
Thus codes tend to be highly con- 
servative, and rightly so. 

However it has been my experi- 
ence that they have been unduly 
conservative, even when the build- 
ing is a single family residence, iso- 
lated from public access, and 
financed by the owner. An engi- 
neered house can be built only by 
someone determined enough to get 
through the maze of bureaucrats 
whose purpose is to enforce a code 
designed to protect moneylenders 
rather than either the public or the 
builder. 

Because of this, a great deal of 
research into novel construction 
methods and techniques has been 



lost. Years ago I engaged in exten- 
sive correspondence with Frazier 
Formam Peters, a pioneer in the 
use of concrete in construction of 
private homes and perhaps the 
most important architect of stone 
“traditional” residences in our his- 
tory; and problems with codes 
figure largely in that correspon- 
dence. (There is an allied difficulty, 
which is rules designed to protect 
construction trades unions, but 
that can of worms would take far 
too long to discuss, since there is 
right on both sides here as well as in 
the code situation.) 

Mostly, my article was intended 
to point out that we’ve got plenty of 
construction materials left on Earth 
if only we’ll be a bit more thought- 
ful about how to use them, and I’ll 
let that conclusion stand.

Dear Jim, 

Congratulations on the August 
Galaxy! I liked just about every- 
thing in it, especially Ed Pang- 
born’s yarn. The Company of 
Glory. (Mark Bilsen postulates the 
influence of W. H. Hudson on 
Pangborn’s latest work, esp. Die, 
The Craven City (author’s collec- 
tion). His commentary has been 
published in the otherwise undis- 
tinguished June issue of his fan- 
zine, Alien Fwowup. I do not hold 
with this thesis myself; the entire 
matter of deep exegesis needs to be 
more carefully gone into. 

LeGuin is her usual charming 
mordant and disconcerting self in

that will remain with me long after 
I have forgotten the illo (is that one 
by Staffore?) which reaches hard 
for incisiveness but burns its fingers 
on the foreshortening-as-emotion. 

The Pohl & Kornbluth is several 
steps above competent, but disap- 
pointing through its very effective- 
ness. (See my letter in the March 
Glitterglumph titled ‘The Long-dis- 
tance Sadness of the Competent

Er . yes. 

Dear Editor, 

There is an old saying that all 
good things have an end. We of the 
sf world want to put off a mutation 
of our fiction toward vulnerability, 
dreading a final chapter for this 
genre. Surely, we say: let a hundred 
more flowers bloom; let the harvest 
outlast our day. 

Nonetheless, many complex 
factors make up sf and nourish it. 
No man has been able to pin it 
down — who can assure us what is 
essential? 

Both Baen and Bova, as well as 
the rest of the staffs, must often be 
reminded how sf magazines have 
prevailed so long. Strangely, they 
persist for decades, though spe- 
cialized — and even general, like 
LIFE — magazines pass away. The 
magazines have been both in- 
gredient and binding glue since 
1926. Suppose they are the vital 
link? 

If the magazines go down, ad- 
mittedly the security and occupa- 
tions of only a few could be spoiled. 
Established and veteran authors 



would continue with other markets; 
indeed the trends are proceeding 
now. But what if the magazines 
turned out to be the Goose that laid 
the Golden Eggs? Once they are 
killed, sf might dissolve into the 
general. No light would fall on its 
nature, only regret for seeing a 
wonder stifled. 

Furthermore, readers would lose 
the stimulation of new entertain- 
ments; fiction would lack the 
stimulus of new authors that 
operate in distinct varieties. 

Without the catalyst of dedicated 
magazines, sf might come apart, 
like a wire puzzle does when a key 
link is taken. Once such dismant- 
ling starts, no one can re-set any 
limits since the art remains a riddle 
from its origins. Far worse, its 
identity stands in peril. 

Identity looms more important 
than safe prosperity or larger than 
entertainment, stimulus to fresh 
departures. For once sf begins to 
lose its unique status, the lesser 
needs are driven in its wake. 

However, fate is not fixed. Al- 
though the field needs more 
periodicals, not less, they are 
holding on w'ell. Once choice comes 
upon readers, editors, writers alike: 
w hether (o save the arrangement or 
to drop the magazines and set a 
dark course. 

Who can tell the trouble that 
might lie along that uncharted 
path? The risk shows, but not any 
apparent gains. If people seek ad- 
ventures they should ask for bolder 
experimental stories, not for revolts 
against our struggling magazines.
